<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast began with a heated discussion about the controversial Seattle Seahawks-Green Bay Packers game, specifically focusing on a disputed touchdown and the replacement referees' perceived incompetence.  The hosts, along with Travis (unseen), dissected fan reactions on Twitter and the ensuing player criticisms and potential fines. This segment was punctuated by a major coffee spill causing significant chaos. The conversation then transitioned to the hosts' contract negotiations, Darrell Revis's injury, the NHL lockout, the death of Sherman Hemsley and the ensuing will disputes, Bonnie Franklin's cancer battle, and internal show matters, including an intern's lack of awareness and a guest's recounted threesome.  Heavy profanity and sexually explicit language were prevalent throughout this portion, especially surrounding the NFL game and the recounted sexual experiences.  Google Voice functionality was also a topic of discussion.

Next, the show shifted to discussions about locker room behavior amongst men, focusing on perceived homoeroticism. This was followed by a rant about the significant traffic congestion in New York City caused by visits from Barack Obama, Mitt Romney, and Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, with particular focus on Ahmadinejad's views on the Holocaust and homosexuality and his appearance on Piers Morgan's show.  A substantial portion focused on a Texas high school student who chose corporal punishment (a paddling) over suspension for cheating, focusing on the male vice principal spanking the female student, despite school policy, and the hosts’ reactions to the story including speculation about the involved parties’ motivations. Their own parenting experiences and listener phone calls (hampered by technical difficulties) on the subject were also discussed. E-Roc and an intern were present in the studio, with Deepak Chopra, his son Gotham, and stand-up comedian Bob Golub scheduled for later appearances.

A female caller, Megan, participated in a sexually suggestive story-creation exercise with the hosts, resulting in a highly graphic and absurd narrative.  A male caller, Dave from Boston, then recounted his own experience with a paddling in junior high.  This led to a segment featuring Deepak Chopra and his son, Gotham, discussing Reiki, Deepak’s spiritual beliefs, his son's documentary about him, addictions, spirituality, organized religion, extraterrestrial life, and various social and political issues, with Gotham often offering contrasting perspectives.  Anecdotes about Chopra's early life and career were also shared.

The next segment focused on Deepak and Gotham Chopra promoting their documentary, "Decoding Deepak," including a story about impromptu surgery in New Jersey. This was followed by comedian Bob Golub's appearance. Bob recounted stories from his upbringing in Youngstown, Ohio, detailing experiences with the mob, prison time for drug-related offenses, and interactions with various characters. He discussed a bizarre incident involving a firecracker and a joint, prison life, his path to becoming a comedian, encounters with Richard Pryor and Muhammad Ali, and his minor role in *Goodfellas*, including his unconventional audition methods.

A later segment featured Bob Golub discussing his past cocaine use in the 1980s, including anecdotes from Brighton Beach and Fort Lauderdale, and a story about a large amount of cocaine falling into a neighbor's yard. He also detailed an attempt to profit from the Mariel Boatlift. The conversation shifted to his current life as a comedian, including plugs for his shows, his family life, current marijuana use, a story about his son and Bob Dylan, and a humorous anecdote about covering up his marijuana use. He compared the toughness of various comedians, recounting a vulgar story involving ejaculating into another comedian's hairpiece.  The hosts also briefly discussed past interactions with Howard Stern.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  But enough of this palaver! Let's get the show on the road!  Yes!  How'd it go with the girl yesterday?  What?  I need to know, I haven't talked to you guys.  Oh, no, we just had a little chit-chat with the, uh...  I did the old sneakeroo.  I snuck out of here.  With the, uh, Ron and Fez intern.  I did the cartoon, uh, tippy-toes out the door.  She wasn't no part of, uh, anything.  No, both of you guys struck out. 
[00:00:30]  Yeah.  You don't think she liked me?  No, Jimmy, I don't think, I don't think she...  I haven't, it was just, I like, I like just yapping with the, uh...  I have my thoughts on the whole thing.  See what that whole thing's about.  I didn't want to say it out loud.  What's that?  Well, this one, first of all...  No, apparently not.  Oh, you asked?  Well, yeah.  She wasn't a lesbian.  Oh, no.  She, she...  Then why isn't she dating?  I don't know, that was a little odd.  So then what's that about?  I don't know.  Or is it this? 
[00:01:00]  Uh...  You can only hope.  That one we can't say, I guess.  Sorry.  Maybe I'll just tweet that word so you know what we're talking about.  Yeah.  So I think we're all in agreement that the Seattle Seahawks won an amazing football game  last night.  Yeah, I heard there was a little controversy.  I think we're all in agreement.  I did not see...  I watched a minute of it at the cellar.  I will bet a lot of money that you're going to see real refs in the NFL. 
[00:01:30]  Really?  Possibly by Sunday.  Very soon.  Very soon.  I guess they're having a hell of a time.  Very soon.  With this.  Well, me and Travis were discussing before the show, and he's right.  These are Division III refs.  And they're not used to seeing the game this fast.  No, huh?  They're probably very qualified refs.  They've been doing it most of their adult lives or whatever.  But they're not used to seeing guys jump, you know, 12 feet off the ground.  And, you know, the speed in the NFL. 
[00:02:00]  They can't keep up.  I love that, like, call.  There's two refs standing right next to each other.  Everyone is tweeting this picture.  With two different calls, yeah.  One is saying no catch or no touchdown, excuse me.  And the other is saying touchdown!  Touchdown!  Man!  Pretty much everyone's in agreement, I'll stop fucking around with this, that the Packers  got screwed last night.  Yeah.  What about instant replay?  Can't replay fix it?  Oh, they replayed for...  What was the replay then? 
[00:02:30]  They reviewed it, but you can't review whether...  So why did they take ten minutes?  You can't review who caught it.  Because they were...  What were they reviewing then?  They were reviewing whether it was a touchdown.  I don't know.  I think from what I heard, they wanted to see who had possession.  Yeah.  And it apparently was co-possession in the NFL.  Well, yeah.  It was a simultaneous catch.  It was the last play of the game.  Yeah, a bit of a Hail Mary, more or less.  And, I mean, the Packard dude...  Who's the Packard dude?  Jennings. 
[00:03:00]  Jennings.  Comes down on it.  Look at this!  And then...  Touchdown, waving it off.  That's a...  They both sort of were on the ball, but it was pretty obvious Jennings had it.  That's your screen cap up there.  One ref saying no, the other ref saying yes.  Oh, amazing.  Who was the other guy?  Tate or something like that?  Yeah.  And Tate had his hands on the ball, but not as much as Jennings did.  Yeah, so it can't be a simultaneous catch because Jennings had possession first.  It looked like it.  And then...  It certainly looks like that, Travis.  Who's Jennings?  Jennings is the Packer.  Yeah, the Packer guy. 
[00:03:30]  Look, he's got the...  Oh, that ain't good.  I just dumped coffee everywhere.  What the fuck did I miss?  That's a tough call, man.  No, it's not.  I mean, from here and from this angle, it's hard to see.  Oh, now he has...  Okay, he has it.  Uh-huh.  He's two idiots.  Wow.  Sorry.  Okay.  Coffee spill just completely took me out.  Oops!  Oh, yeah, that's easily a Packer ball.  That's Packer ball.  You will care when the fucking equipment goes out. 
[00:04:00]  Packer ball?  Packer ball?  That's fucking green-beage ball.  There was a rumor a couple months ago that some of the refs that were...  That some of the replacement refs had been fired from the lingerie football league.  Oh, yeah.  Wait, plays...  Uh-oh.  Plays stands as called?  Yeah.  Which was what?  Touchdown.  Touchdown.  They fucked the Packers.  But if...  Oh, you didn't see any of this, Jim.  If it stood as called touchdown, how'd the Packers get fucked?  No, no, no.  Because they're saying that Seattle had the ball, and they scored a touchdown. 
[00:04:30]  Yeah, they're saying...  Oh, that's...  They said Seattle caught that?  Yes!  That's...  Get the fuck out of here!  Jimmy, thus then, why Twitter has exploded.  Every trending topic has something to do with this play.  How terrible.  I misunderstood.  Oh, no, man.  I thought that was Green Bay going for the Hail Mary.  Right.  No, it was the Seahawks.  That was Seattle going for the...  Whoops.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Oh, my God.  What a fucking horrible call. 
[00:05:00]  Yes, Twitter was a light.  Wow.  So, yeah, there was a rumor that some of these replacement refs had been fired by the lingerie  football league, and last night, after the game, the lingerie football league, they hadn't  commented.  Oh.  And they finally did, and they said that there are some refs in the NFL right now that  we did fire for just gross incompetence.  In the lingerie football league.  Wow.  The lingerie football league.  They don't make fun of the lingerie football league.  No, very respected. 
[00:05:30]  All right, good.  But to have a problem with the refs and then them going to the NFL.  What could the regular refs be asking for?  How much more are they asking for?  I'm not sure how much more they're asking for, but I don't think it's worth this.  And they're not a union, right?  I think that's why the NFL is able to fuck with them as much as they are.  But I think this would be the tipping point.  Like, now you're seeing players, like a lot of Packers last night, tweeting about how fucking 
[00:06:00]  ridiculous this was.  You know what pisses me off?  I was watching a bunch of...  I'm cleaning up coffee.  I hope we don't go off the air.  We'll be fine.  Where's Mars?  Where's somebody in here to help out?  I'm totally out of this break, because I'm trying to, like, make sure we don't go off the  air.  Is there an intern?  Hey, Iroch, you sent Sal in a cup of coffee.  You fucking bitch.  He's screaming at me, Iroch.  An intern brought in paper towels, but I don't think...  He spilled his coffee.  I think we're going to be all right.  All right.  So I was watching...  Thanks, Sal.  I got it.  Just try to fucking... 
[00:06:30]  Oh, wow.  Sal's going to do something?  Wow.  Sal, you know, this was a good job.  Yeah, make sure you check the box.  You got some on his lap there.  Check.  They were trying to get comments in the locker room, and a bunch of these players were  like, whoa, I don't want an envelope in my locker.  You're not allowed to really talk bad about the refs anymore.  What's the envelope mean?  You're fine?  Yeah.  He was basically saying, I don't want one of those envelopes.  I thought it was...  And he's being sarcastic as all hell.  Obviously, you can tell what he wants to say.  Why can't you, you know, beat up the refs in professional sports? 
[00:07:00]  Especially these refs.  They're doing it now.  Huh?  TJ Lang, he's on the Packers.  Right, so they don't care.  They're going to get fined.  Tweets, got fucked by the refs.  Embarrassing.  Thanks, NFL.  Then he tweeted, fuck it.  Fine me and use the money to pay the regular refs.  Oh, really?  That's pretty good.  Yeah, these guys are losing games because of a terrible referee.  It's awful.  Well, what is the problem with fucking bitching at the refs after a game?  What is the problem with that?  I don't know.  No one likes them anyway.  It's against protocol. 
[00:07:30]  But who gives a fuck if their feelings are hurt?  Yeah.  You know, these guys are all pumped up.  They've got adrenaline, and, you know, there's some bad calls that go down, and then they're  not allowed to even, you know, talk about it without getting fined.  This isn't even a, it's not even a bad call.  Like, this cost them a win.  Of course, but I'm just talking in general, in sports, why, you know, you can't go after  the refs or the umps anymore.  That's ridiculous.  Seattle has a good team this year, though, huh?  Seattle's got a very good defense.  Well, Pete Carroll.  They were kicking the Packers' ass, and, you know, they could have won the game legitimately, 
[00:08:00]  but, you know.  I said, well, Pete Carroll, because he's a good coach, and he gets the right guys there to  coach and shit.  13th man beat us tonight.  Right.  Seattle, you can't feel good about that win, because y'all really lost.  The refs gave y'all the game.  Mm-mm.  Man.  Come on, NFL, this shit is getting out of control.  Cost us the damn game.  That was bullshit.  This is getting ridiculous.  These are all, like, players.  Players.  This isn't just like, so they're all going to get fined. 
[00:08:30]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  So they're all going to get fined.  I don't know what the protocol for tweeting things is.  That might be, like, a team decision.  They started going after guys for tweeting bad shit.  Man.  I think that's all.  I'm not sure if there's, like, an NFL policy as far as what you say on Twitter after.  A game.  I know you can't tweet during a game.  I'm more pissed that these guys can't really beat up the refs without getting fined.  So.  Especially when it's a call like that. 
[00:09:00]  The refs should get fined for their horrible fucking calls.  Cals.  Yes, exactly.  In the football games.  I hear you.  So that's something everyone's talking about today.  Yeah.  Everyone.  That was the biggie of last night.  Big tweet.  When Darrell Revis is out for the season, I'm a very sad man today.  What's that?  The ACL?  Yeah, yeah.  What happened?  The ACL.  He's probably done with the Jets as well.  Broke my knee, man.  He's done for the fucking year. 
[00:09:30]  What's that mean?  For the Jets?  It means our defense is going to be a little.  Not as good.  A little holey?  Oh, boy.  Will it be?  Oh, boy.  But all the bloggers are like, well, if you're a playoff team, you'll figure it out.  All great teams figure it out.  They'll adapt.  That's what they're discussing.  All great teams, they overcome.  Then they bring up an example of a great team that had lost somebody that season but went on to win the fucking Super Bowl. 
[00:10:00]  You know, all great teams.  Oh, shut up.  We're depressed today.  It's when people come together.  Right.  If you're a true playoff team.  Oh, God.  The fucking...  All those stupid cliches.  That's what they're saying today.  Oh, great.  Rex Ryan even looked sad.  Yeah.  He looked really sad.  Well, keep up your good nature.  By the way, what are Seattle Seahawks players tweeting?  I'd love to read their Twitter feeds.  That's a good question.  I don't know what they're tweeting.  Great job.  This is all working out so well. 
[00:10:30]  Great call.  I know the guy who caught the ball was saying, yeah, I caught the ball.  Well, it's more than just a catch.  Oh, thank you, Hicks89.  That's right.  There was a blatant offensive pass interference on that play as well.  Was there?  Yeah, go back, man.  So they should have called him for offensive pass interference.  And then, of course, they should have ruled it not a touchdown.  Troy Aikman tweeting,  These Games Are a Joke.  Troy Aikman. 
[00:11:00]  Wow.  It's not just a guy named Troy Aikman.  No.  No.  It's really him.  Yes.  Oh, man.  Troy Aikman.  Dirk Nowitzki.  I'm not going to watch another NFL game until real refs are back.  Oh, yeah.  Okay.  Yeah, yeah.  Okay.  I ain't going to watch.  All right.  Sure you're not.  Sure.  That's like everybody that says they're leaving the country if such and such is elected.  You know you're not.  It's tough to bet on these games, though, because you just don't know what's going to happen.  It makes it exciting.  Yeah, it makes it frustrating.  You have no clue.  It's more of a coin toss. 
[00:11:30]  Yeah, has anyone...  It's the human elements back in football.  Has anyone left the country because their guy wasn't in?  Not right.  I reside in Mexico for maybe eight months out of the year.  He's pretty much doing podcasts at this point.  Yeah, yeah.  Oh, Jesse, Jesse, Jesse.  Pirate face.  Seahawks Twitter.  What are they saying, Sam?  It's not them. 
[00:12:00]  Eh?  Those are just people who mention the Seahawks.  Get on the mic.  Oh.  Oh, boy.  He's having trouble getting on that mic.  You swung it away from me.  You swung it away from your face.  Now I'm on.  I know.  Oh.  It's like hip-hop, you know, being on the mic like this, like being in a lowrider.  Jesus.  Are we staying here?  Huh?  Are we staying here?  I don't know what's going on.  I'm not even joking.  Are you talking about the contract?  Yeah.  I certainly hope so.  I was just thinking about that this morning.  I don't know if we're staying, and I'm not trying to like...  Please do.  I'm not trying to stir the pot or anything, I swear to you.  It's just a real emotion I'm just bringing out right now. 
[00:12:30]  I don't know if we're staying.  Did Bob talk to you at all?  No.  No?  Oh, shit.  I think he tried calling you last night or some shit.  Oh, really?  Yeah, I think we're moving ahead.  Answer the phone, Opie.  You gotta pick up the phone.  I didn't feel like you last night.  It would be good for my family if you stayed.  I think we're moving ahead.  Yeah, I don't think he called me for real.  But are we staying?  For reals.  Did you talk to him?  That's the impression I get.  Did you talk to him?  Yeah.  Yesterday?  Uh, yeah.  And then he said he was gonna call you. 
[00:13:00]  Oh, boy.  My viral videos are not paying the bills yet.  You don't have a voicemail set up.  No, I refuse.  It's like...  I refuse.  It's like, this customer does not have a voicemail set up.  It's like, oh.  No, I refuse.  And then you go right to the text.  Well, that's because of my mom.  What?  So she can't leave her fucking awful messages.  Can't you block her calls?  Or block her?  Seriously, I might even...  But if you're worried about that, you can block.  She uses multiple phones.  Oh, no. 
[00:13:30]  Wow.  You know what you should do?  She knows...  She's on to me a little bit.  Get a Google Voice number and link it to your phone.  Really?  Yes.  That sounds very complicated.  No, it's not.  It's very easy.  And then you can give that phone number to anyone you want.  And you'll know when somebody's calling your Google Voice number.  And it can dump to Google Voice voicemail.  How do you get a Google Voice...  Oh, jeez, Jimmy.  Oh, no.  Here he goes again.  Here he goes again.  It's all about maps again.  Here it is.  I didn't know you could do that. 
[00:14:00]  Here comes Street View 2.  Future Jimmy has no idea what's going on in the present.  No, look.  Hey, he sounded really intelligent about the future.  How about you focus on the present?  Fair enough.  I love future Jimmy.  I do theorize very well while I don't know what's happening right now.  I can't argue that point.  But Google Voice, I know people that have it, but I don't know what it is.  Yeah.  You sign up for a phone number.  Yeah.  You pick your phone number.  Nice.  And you can link it to your cell phone. 
[00:14:30]  How?  I can show you all of this during the break.  But when you pick a number, can you make it a fun number?  You can, but a lot of the fun numbers have been picked already.  Oh.  Yeah.  How much is it?  It's free.  Why would they do that?  Because Google wants to rule the world just like Apple.  Oh.  Jesus.  So you link your number and then when people call that number?  It'll show up on your phone.  Wait a minute.  Does that mean my mom gets to leave fucking messages?  Well, I'm saying if you want to set up your voicemail so that regular people can leave you voicemails 
[00:15:00]  and you want to give people that you don't want them to have your cell phone number,  give them your Google Voice.  So I have to tell her, I don't know, let me see.  Can you text Google Voice?  So I have to tell her I changed my cell number?  Wow.  This is how I got rid of Bobo from calling me.  Really?  Really.  He used to call me all the time and I had no idea what to do.  I didn't want to, I wasn't going to change my phone number for Bobo.  So I just said, fuck it.  I got a Google Voice number.  The next time he called me, oh no, I think I called him from it and I got his machine or 
[00:15:30]  whatever and I was like, Bobo, hey, got a new number.  Here it is.  Oh, shit.  You know, kept mine and never answered my Google Voice number because I knew it would  always be Bobo and then that was it.  I think I deleted the app from my phone, as a matter of fact.  I'm sorry.  That's great.  And I'm pretty sure you can just automatically block numbers to dump straight to the voicemail.  Holy mackerel.  And you can dial and it's from your Google number?  Yeah.  Get the fuck.  That's amazing. 
[00:16:00]  I swear to God.  I love Jimmy.  I didn't know this.  You can pick what area code you want and then it'll be my phone number.  I didn't know this one either.  Dude, because people would tell me about it and I never cared.  They're like, I got a Google number.  Do ya?  Do ya?  That would always be my answer.  Oh, Jesus.  I didn't know.  Oh, this is going to be fucking great.  You know how many naughty boy phone numbers there are going to be?  Dude.  Oh, my God.  Dude, I fucking had no idea this was a possibility.  Yeah.  Oh.  Listen.  Hello, Craigslist. 
[00:16:30]  Oh, are you in trouble?  Jimmy's in trouble.  Geez.  I feel like the world has just opened up to me.  Yeah, it's a brand new world.  You just went from black and white to color.  Dude, I now know how Damien Echols felt when he walked out of jail.  Jimmy just found One-Eyed Willie's rich stuff.  That was his crazy man.  That's funny.  That's amazing.  I didn't know that.  Yeah.  Well, I guess I have to set something up like that.  I haven't had a voicemail in three...  How long have I been married now?  Four years?  Yeah.  Four years. 
[00:17:00]  Almost four years.  You should get one, though, for the emergencies.  Like, sometimes you got to have it.  Although, I rarely...  No, I don't.  I don't have to have it.  I have some people that I want to hear messages from.  Like, all my friends I text.  Like, I almost never call my friends.  Never.  It's important.  But once in a while, I get a voicemail.  I'm like, that was too much to text.  But you get a missed call.  Yeah, but...  No missed calls from Bob.  Huh.  Oh, boy.  Maybe he didn't call.  Or maybe he called your other number.  Dumb Bob called my old cell phone.  Yeah, he does that occasionally.  It's a Bob. 
[00:17:30]  What are you doing?  Maybe I'm getting shut out of the New Deal.  Damn.  How is it that I don't do that in your age at times?  How does Louie do it?  I told you, the one I shot for Louie in the Dane episode,  I got a call.  I happened to be in town.  It was a fucking Friday.  6 p.m.  I happened to have my old phone out.  But it rings.  I see it's Louie.  So I'm like, hello.  He goes, can you be in the Bronx at age?  I'm like, okay.  He's like, because somebody had dropped out.  And then he sent the car for me in an hour.  Like, that's why I didn't get rid of that number.  I'm like, because once in a while... 
[00:18:00]  Good idea, yeah.  You get the old...  That would have cost me a fucking...  Sure.  You know, an appearance.  I don't call anybody.  I don't like getting calls from anybody.  Everything could just be dealt with in a text.  Once in a while, you got it.  But God, fucking Google voicemail.  I had no idea it was that easy.  Oh, man.  Sam, in a matter of minutes, just signed up for a number and forwarded it to his phone.  Yeah, but Sam, here's the question.  Where do you listen to your messages?  On my phone.  Oh.  Oh, it leaves them on your phone. 
[00:18:30]  It doesn't leave them on your...  It forwards to your cell phone.  Yeah.  So you can actually talk.  What is Google's advantage for doing this like?  Because, again, the Internet...  You remember Kaku said that the Internet is basically just...  Oh, boy.  A national...  It's a worldwide phone system.  That was what he said the Internet was designed to be.  So this is kind of what it's supposed to be.  Oh, man.  But how does that advantage to Google?  Like, free Gmail, how does that help them financially?  Oh, boy. 
[00:19:00]  It's kind of advertising.  I can actually help on that one anyway.  Yeah, because it basically...  It knows, based on your emails, it knows how to target the ads.  So it's a more pinpointed revenue generator.  You know what I'm saying?  Like, if in my emails it always says SiriusXM, Opie, and Anthony,  I'm going to get targeted ads for them, you know, giving me units and cars that might have Sirius Satellite Radio,  sign up for maybe the Opie and Anthony, you know, Facebook page or whatever.  Do they do that? 
[00:19:30]  Yes, absolutely.  Oh, wow.  I don't notice shit when I check my Gmail.  Yeah, check it.  Take a look at the ads.  Like, there's usually a top, a main ad.  I don't look at it.  And there's three sides.  I never look at it.  It's always relevant to whatever you're looking at.  I never look up top.  Yeah, I don't either.  I never noticed it.  I just noticed there's shit I don't need up there.  Yeah, take a look at Sam's.  Oh, I always, I never look at that.  That shit?  I don't look at that shit.  Who looks at that?  Who looks at that shit?  Oh, boy, yeah.  You don't want anybody to see inside your mail, then?  Because who knows what kind of ads?  Yeah, ads pop up. 
[00:20:00]  Oh, boy.  If you fucking, you know, a bunch of ads for, like, being recircumcised in teenage, late adult life.  I have ads for suits and Indy cars.  I feel like a man.  Whoa.  See, that means it's not working.  You're not a suit guy.  Exactly.  Or an Indy car guy.  Or an Indy car guy.  Yeah.  The Indy car guy.  If it was an ad for a radio school, I would go, that's perfect.  He was probably sending a lot of emails about indie wrestlers suiting up.  Stupid wrestler.  Did they just read your email heading, or did they read the email? 
[00:20:30]  They couldn't.  They read the email.  They search.  Well, they don't, like, literally read your emails, but they search your emails for terms.  Didn't you have an Indy car guy on your after show?  That's it.  E-Rock sent me a picture of me holding the Indy car car.  Oh, wow.  There it is.  You are a loyal listener.  So, look.  But anyways, I'm a captive fucking audience driving home.  I get a lot of ads for transmissions.  That's funny. 
[00:21:00]  That stupid Indy trophy.  What the fuck was that?  Some guy was walking by the studio with a giant Indy car trophy, so I was like...  I saw it on the way out.  I couldn't be bothered by that thing.  I got to do a show, though, so I was like, let's take a look at the trophy.  Yeah.  Was it heavy?  It's about 40 pounds.  Next time one of those guys comes in with a trophy, I'm taking it, and I'm running with it.  That's it.  Just to see what would happen.  Someone has to do it.  Because they don't look like...  I don't think you'd be thrown in jail.  And they don't look like tough guys that bring them in here.  No, they have white gloves on.  They look like nerds.  Yeah. 
[00:21:30]  They look like idiots.  Just bully him out of his trophy.  We've had the Stanley Cup in here a couple times, and man, we just got to grab it and run one day.  Why not?  I mean, I guess.  They know in the end it's a goof.  But then what if you have to wait for the elevator?  Well, that'd be awkward.  Isn't there stairs?  Yeah, there's stairs.  I could do stairs.  How many floors up are we?  Only 38.  You got to watch out.  I could do it.  Troy Kwan might join you in there and take down the elevator with you and then beat you up once you get downstairs.  On the street.  That's it.  You want to go in the elevator? 
[00:22:00]  Go downstairs?  I got invited into the elevator with Troy once.  Did you?  Nice.  Oh, you got invited?  Yeah, yeah.  Nice.  Oh, that's right.  He wanted to kiss my lips.  Oh.  Troy and Danny used to hate each other.  They once had a giant fight in the office and everybody noticed.  Do you guys still hate each other?  No, no, no.  That was a while back.  That's pretty goddamn funny.  No, but I mean, are you guys talking shit or are you just like avoiding each other?  Troy went up to him.  He did the elevator line.  That's right, Danny.  He did the elevator thing. 
[00:22:30]  And then Danny was like, what are you going to do?  What are we going to fight?  Is that what we're going to do?  Yeah.  You want to fight me?  And then Troy came up to him and got right in his face and said, no, Danny, I don't want  to fight you.  I want to kiss you on the lips and made like a fake kiss.  It's so weird.  Troy has a shtick.  Wait, when was that?  Is that like an action movie guy?  What was that about?  It's a year or two ago.  That's a little weird.  It's weird, man.  It's weird.  But it was intimidating.  But that's, I'll tell you why Troy does that because he probably is, he probably has a  propensity for violence and he wants to, that's his way of diffusing it without being violent 
[00:23:00]  towards somebody.  Like Bugs Bunny.  But if he kissed you on the lips, wouldn't you just openly laugh at the guy?  Like, really?  No, I'd open my mouth.  Exactly.  Exactly.  How do you laugh when you're cleaning cum off the front of your pants?  What is he going for?  He kisses you on the lips and then you're so outraged you have to punch him?  Wouldn't you just laugh?  I think it's just his way of saying like he's going to, you know, kiss you on the lips.  But he can't threaten you in the workplace.  No, I think he actually means he's going to kiss you. 
[00:23:30]  Isn't that how he got his nose broken?  It's like prison rape.  Like asserting your dominance over another man.  Yeah, that's a really aggressive act.  Fuck you till you love me sort of a thing.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I don't want to be kissed on the lips by a man, but if he did that, I would just laugh.  And I'm like, really?  What's wrong with you?  You would only laugh?  Well, what would you do?  No, I'm just kidding.  I'm just making mental notes.  But I wouldn't go like fucking caveman.  Like, oh, God.  I'd be like, you're an idiot.  If it was a friend, I would laugh it off. 
[00:24:00]  But if it was a guy doing that aggressively, that's like being slapped in the face.  That's not like being punched.  It's like being slapped.  I think if I didn't know the person, then it would be a different reaction.  But if someone we work with, I'd be like, really, dude?  But after a big argument?  Yeah.  I'd be like, fuck you, dude.  I'll kill you.  I'll do this to you.  I would just laugh.  And then he kisses you on the mat.  I would start fucking laughing.  I wish I could say Danny got the best of Troy that day.  I would take my elbow and throw it up and block him and grab the back of his shoulder and pull him into my other elbow. 
[00:24:30]  Oh, my God.  Nice.  That's a bow, everyone.  I just saw the play in super slow-mo.  Fucking Tate actually, his right arm's not even on the ball.  Oh, he only had one hand on the ball.  He didn't catch that ball.  Did you see that?  Oh, man.  Not in super slow motion, no.  It looked, I couldn't believe that was a...  Obviously, Jennings caught the ball, but then it sort of looked like Tate was on the ball, but then his whole right arm is off the ball. 
[00:25:00]  Yeah.  He didn't catch the ball.  No, it's so obvious now.  At first, I wasn't really sure what I was looking at.  But in slow-mo, but they have to pick that shit up in, you know, regular speed.  What's happening there?  That's Revis.  Oh, boy.  That's when he got injured.  Oh, a star is torn, they say.  Oh, how terrible, because it's ACL.  An ACL, you never look good after you rip one of those things. 
[00:25:30]  It looks like it really hurts.  It just looks painful.  Yeah.  Damn.  And his knee or his foot knee?  He's the best cornerback in the league by far.  He broke his knee, man.  He broke his knee, dude.  Yeah, we'll be all right, because we're a playoff contender, right, Rex Ryan?  You find ways to win.  We'll overcome.  Find ways.  All good teams do that.  Teams, not just one player.  That's right, Travis.  Yeah, Tebow.  What's happening with hockey?  Nothing.  A lot of players are starting to go, what the fuck is wrong with Batman? 
[00:26:00]  Overseas.  Overseas, huh?  What's wrong with this idiot?  This is the time to lose all your momentum.  You still need to get fucking people into the sport, you idiot.  I know they canceled all preseason games for the rest of the world.  And no one is talking about it.  No one gives a fuck.  Because the players, they have options.  Yeah, that's the problem.  All of them can go overseas.  And a bunch of these guys have a lot of respect for these other leagues.  Sure, yeah.  They're not just shitty leagues to them.  That's the thing.  With hockey, it's different than other sports in that there's other places to go and other 
[00:26:30]  respectable places to play.  Very respectable.  If there's a baseball strike, maybe you'll go to Japan, maybe.  Right, right.  But, like, yeah, there's a lot of places in Europe that...  They go to Europe, man.  And those leagues are pretty fucking hot.  Some players just go to Europe and they can play in the NHL.  Right.  Jesus.  No one cares.  No, no one cares.  No one's talking about this.  That's what I'm talking about.  Fucking Bettman did not figure this one out.  He didn't read this one right. 
[00:27:00]  Because this will hurt in the end.  No one's even talking about it.  Mm-mm.  It's like, I don't care.  Whatever.  Boom.  What else going on?  Can I say something really depressing I just saw?  What happened?  About Sherman Hemsley?  No.  I don't know.  What happened?  Money?  Yeah.  He killed himself?  No, no, no, no, no, no, no.  He died of lung cancer.  I don't remember him being a smoker, but I guess...  Yeah.  His body's on ice in this funeral home because there's, of course, a dispute over the will. 
[00:27:30]  Oh, my God.  He had a beloved friend and manager, Flora Enchington, and I think I met her, and I think  that was the person he always referred you to.  I don't remember her name, her face, but I know I had spoken to her back when I would  talk to him occasionally, and now there's a guy who says he's a half-brother and the  will's a fraud, but it says the case was headed before a judge on Monday and could be  settled as early as next week.  His estate was reported to be worth more than $50,000. 
[00:28:00]  Whoa.  They're fighting over $50,000 and his stupid body's on ice over this?  It's Sherman Hed.  That's disgusting.  He's one of the most iconic guys on TV history.  Oh, my God.  Why can't they put him to rest and then deal with this shit?  Why do they have to keep the body...  But how does he only have $50,000?  Dude, I guess back then the syndication money wasn't fighting over $50,000?  Yeah.  Oh, boy.  I mean, that's a lot of cash if you have none, but for Sherman Hemsley to only be worth...  He's a TV legend. 
[00:28:30]  Well, you forget that these giant contracts didn't exist.  Right.  Same thing with sports players.  A lot of these old players, you read all the time how they've got to sell their rings,  do these signings every weekend just to make money, because they didn't make millions of  dollars when they were playing.  Like DVD rights they don't have.  I think Hollywood's disgusting.  Yeah.  Why can't you bring some of these guys up that obviously got fucked because these deals  weren't in place yet?  How do you allow someone like him to only have $50,000 when he dies? 
[00:29:00]  He was a fucking legend.  But at the time, he wasn't getting fucked.  You know?  I wonder what he was making, and I wonder what kind of syndication...  Maybe he might have pissed it all away.  Those shows were only on the air five or six years, so they get the big money for five  or six years.  Right.  That wasn't a guarantee that you had enough money for the rest of your life.  But they didn't see syndication.  Like, they didn't understand the amount of money and the amount of replays, because  no one saw cable TV coming.  Right.  You didn't? 
[00:29:30]  Out of everyone in the room, you certainly should have saw it coming.  Young Jimmy just spouting to his friends about cable television.  I said when I was young, I said, someday there will only be one channel.  And his friend shows him the guide, and Jimmy's like, you can do that?  What?  Yeah, I really...  I will admit the inconsistencies.  That's funny.  President Jim is a zilch.  Jim of the future knows all. 
[00:30:00]  Oh, Jim of the future rules.  But Jim in the present, eh, not so much.  Wow, that's fucked up.  50 grand.  But yeah, oh boy, why do you think they keep him on ice?  Like, bury the fucking guy.  Who cares?  Yeah, you gotta at least bury the guy.  Maybe there's even a dispute over the money to bury him?  Maybe.  Well, that would suck.  Maybe there's a dispute over what to do.  What to do?  Like, I mean...  But who's the scumbag that's fighting this?  Is it his stepbrother or something you said?  Yeah, it's a half-brother from Philly who just kind of said the will was done six weeks 
[00:30:30]  before he died.  How desperate is that guy that he's fighting over 50 Gs?  I know.  Jefferson, you shouldn't yell at your mammy like that.  Your mammy.  Did he say that?  Yeah.  Fucking Archie.  How great was Mother Jefferson?  Oh.  Who are you calling mammy?  Yeah.  That's sad.  That is.  Some more sad news out of Hollywood, of course.  From one day at a time there. 
[00:31:00]  So, upon your feet.  Yeah.  Upon your feet.  The mom, what was her name?  Anne Romano.  Bonnie Franklin.  Bonnie Franklin.  The big pancreatic cancer.  Dead?  No, not yet.  That's a bad one.  What are signs of pancreatic cancer?  That's a rough one, right?  The Grim Reaper tapping his toe at the fucking foot of your bed.  Looking at his watch.  That's a bad one.  Sorry, Bonnie Franklin.  That's weird. 
[00:31:30]  Oh, no.  Yeah.  Shouldn't the drug addict go first?  You would think, right?  If there was a god sorting this shit out.  Schneider's still alive?  Schneider.  Yeah.  Was there a controversy back then with his cigarettes rolled up in his sleeve?  Is there a smoking message there?  And his cigarettes rolled up?  No controversy.  I just think he looks cool.  Oh, he looks so cool.  That's when you got away with shit. 
[00:32:00]  Yeah.  You didn't live as long, but you got away with shit.  Poor Bonnie Franklin.  And she's going to undergo some type of treatment.  I don't know.  Cancer Peggy on that fucking Cancer Institute place on those commercials where she's like,  and the doctor told me like he was telling me to go to the store.  And she's still alive.  Oh, good.  Good for her.  But Cancer Peggy.  She has a fucking commercial now where she's riding a horse. 
[00:32:30]  How do you tell someone to go to the store like that, depressingly?  Yeah.  Could you go and pick up some milk?  You know, I just checked my Twitter.  We just have idiots.  Yes.  You know, some people think $50,000 is a lot of money.  Oh, my God.  You are the dumbest person alive.  Miss the point guy.  That's miss the point guy.  That is assumed right off the bat.  I know that.  We're talking about a huge TV star. 
[00:33:00]  If you're a huge TV star nowadays, you're worth $10, $20 million.  Minimum.  Yeah, you should have had more money, regardless of how you feel.  How do you not fucking pick up on our discussion, you idiot?  Regardless of how you feel about $50,000, when you think of people in Hollywood, they should have more than $50,000.  Right.  We said it's a lot of money.  Like, if someone doesn't have any money, that's a lot of money.  But in comparison with what other network stars of that magnitude and that legendary... 
[00:33:30]  I almost said ilk, and I switched directions.  I was hoping you would.  For the stepbrother, he's fighting over the $50,000.  Sure, that's a lot of money for him.  But our point was he's worth $50,000.  That's what we were wrapping our heads around.  Our point was that we spit at $50,000.  Yes.  Yeah.  They're fighting over what I wipe my hiney with.  What, a cock?  Yeah.  Just to put it into context... 
[00:34:00]  Yeah.  Sofia Vergara from Modern Family...  Yeah, go ahead.  She's worth $25 million and makes $65,000 per episode.  Thank you.  That's what I'm getting at, you idiot on Twitter.  I don't wipe my hiney with a penis.  We assume you don't.  It's just what I think about.  I wipe it with an ass.  I'm just thinking how funny it would be to wipe your ass with a cock.  A cock?  How would you wipe when you're just jamming it in there? 
[00:34:30]  Who's offering that up?  Just jam it in there.  I just took a shit.  Oh, forget that paper here.  Go ahead.  Do this.  You'd have to reach back.  Hold it there.  Yeah.  It's all soft because he's losing his heart out because it smells like shit.  Terrible image.  I know.  The poor guy just standing there with his fucking pubes getting shit in it. 
[00:35:00]  And you feel so refreshed after.  Thank you.  I feel much cleaner and better.  We're doing filthy.  We're doing the aristocrats right now.  I don't see that on the prep sheet.  Ta-da!  So to that idiot.  Of course 50,000 is a lot for a lot of people.  Dunce.  We're just amazed a guy like that only had 50 Gs.  Poor feller.  Did Sherman smoke?  I guess.  I'm trying to remember.  Because some people just get that.  It's frightening. 
[00:35:30]  What's her name?  Fucking Christopher Reeve's wife.  Yeah.  She fucking got lung cancer and died like...  That story is just forever tragic.  Jesus.  Makes your question your God.  She just fucking...  That's a woman that did the right thing when her husband went down.  What happened?  I don't know.  I don't know why the school shooter just put down...  The school shooter.  Yeah.  Thank you, Clark Kent.  What's going on?  I don't know.  He's just giving me tomato juice.  This is like 80% shit going on. 
[00:36:00]  He put my sandwich...  What happened?  ...and my V8 over by James Norton.  Do you not know who Anthony is or who I am?  That's the question.  No.  No.  B-Rock, are you still in charge of the interns?  Yeah.  I told him to go put Anthony's breakfast right next to him.  Uh, well...  So why...  He doesn't know who Anthony is or who I am?  Oh, boy.  Does he know the difference?  I assumed he did.  Send him in real quick.  Okay, hang on.  Just for a second.  I just want to see if he knows everybody's name.  All right.  Maybe he didn't want to go around you and put it...  That might be true, too.  I would like that because most of the people, especially the new interns, kicked the back  of my chair. 
[00:36:30]  I just want to see if he knows everybody's name.  That's my concern.  Oh, look at him.  He's like, oh, boy.  He's not great interns this semester.  What's this guy's name?  I don't know.  What's your name?  Oh, right.  That's that guy.  Hi, Anthony.  Hi.  Hey, what's up?  Do you know who everyone in the room is by name?  Sure.  Okay, who's everyone in the room?  There's a microphone you have to talk to.  Sam, Travis, Jim, Anthony, and Opie.  Okay.  And who that is?  Yeah, it's Danny.  Okay, thank you.  Just checking.  Thank you.  That's all.  All right.  Thank you, DeRosa.  There you are.  He looks like DeRosa.  Hey, little me. 
[00:37:00]  Yeah, yeah.  I see that.  I called the other day.  I didn't like the fact that his name is Anthony because Sam was lambasting him a bit.  And he's like, oh, that Anthony is an idiot.  And I was like, I don't even like hearing that out of Sam's mouth.  So his new name is, wow, what did you decide on?  I think we ended at Jawa because nothing was wrong.  Yeah, it didn't work, really.  So that bitch fell flat.  That bitch went nowhere.  I mean.  And then another intern I called up to, you know, spout off on the after show. 
[00:37:30]  Well, that's Julie.  Who?  That's intern Julie.  Oh, come on.  Don't talk about Lee that way.  Okay.  It's just inappropriate.  Yeah, I'm going to pour it for Pete's sake.  In turn, Julie, a guy?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Yeah, that's what I heard on the phone.  Well, I called up and I said, hey, it's Anthony from the Opie and Anthony show. 
[00:38:00]  Could you put me through?  And I hear, like, silence.  And I'm like, don't try to figure this out.  Don't.  And I go, and don't hang up on me.  He goes, it's Anthony.  Put me through.  Click.  I call back.  I'm like, hello, what's your name?  Where are you from?  I'm like, hey, fuck.  Put me fucking through.  It's Anthony from the Opie and Anthony.  Just don't fuck me over here.  God damn it.  I got something to say.  Did he put you through? 
[00:38:30]  Yes.  Eventually.  Eventually, yeah.  I bet you Sam told him to hang up.  Sam probably just did, like, the slash.  Oh, yeah, I went like, no, fuck that guy.  No, I always pick up Anthony's calls.  And quite frankly, I would have liked the extra couple minutes with him if he hadn't hung up on him the first time.  Exactly.  I had something to say.  It was getting toward the end of the show.  I was trying to talk about fucking Nicole having the threesome.  She doesn't say that on our show.  Of course not.  No.  But on the after show, she's talking about how she's fucking her and her husband and some chick.  What?  And they're fucking, they're having sex. 
[00:39:00]  But then she said that she's got a rule that the husband can't have, like, intercourse with the other girl.  He'd get a blowjob.  Right.  They'd fucking lick pussy, things like that.  Oh, that marriage is doomed.  And then he could fuck her as the other girl watches, but no fucking.  And I just had to say, look, from experience, he's fucked her.  Especially when you look at someone like Nicole, that is known to tip a few back.  She's probably passed out at some point.  And what do you think?  They just sit there and go, hey, what do you want to do?  While she's passed out? 
[00:39:30]  They're fucking.  I've done it.  I couldn't wait for my wife to pass out so I could fuck the new girl.  So why don't we get her in here?  Because she won't talk about it on our show.  Why?  Well, she's going to talk about it today.  After show is a safe place.  Is it?  That's how people feel.  They feel it's a safe place.  In between plugging your viral videos?  I don't need to plug.  It's taking on a life of its own.  How many miles?  I mean, how many views?  900,000.  Oh, wow.  It's really good.  Wow.  It's doing real well.  It's crazy.  It won't help you, but good. 
[00:40:00]  Negative, guys.  I'm reading the paper.  Good luck to you.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Well, we'll get her in here.  We've got to talk about this.  Yeah, at some point.  She's banged up.  Her partying is.  Oh, man.  Has escalated, huh?  She went to Miami just for the weekend.  Who, Nicole?  Yeah, she's all banged up.  What's going on with her?  She walked in here the other day, too, and said, this studio smells like cocaine.  Yeah.  Yeah, and I was sitting there like, how?  What?  Why would anybody announce?  Like, I don't do cocaine.  I don't know what it smells like.  Someone said that.  Who was someone else said that that came in the studio? 
[00:40:30]  Probably another coke head.  Said it smells like coke.  Yeah.  Really?  You have to have done coke to know what coke smells like.  You have to have it in your nostrils to say that.  Yes, it's got to be in your nose.  What smells like coke?  Oh, my nose hair.  I don't know.  Oh, my nose hair.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Should we take a break?  Is food here yet?  Oh, yeah.  I don't even think we need any.  Did Jimmy's food get here?  Did we do anything this hour?  Certainly.  Not really, huh?  Yeah, you hit the NFL. 
[00:41:00]  Yeah.  Talked about your contract.  NHL strike.  Yeah.  Cancer.  Nice.  And Nicole.  Nice.  Plus the answers.  50 grand is nothing.  50 grand is bullshit.  Nice.  I mean, you hit a lot of topics.  You hit about four hours worth of topics.  Crazy.  We should go home.  What are you saying, Yorick?  I'm saying I don't have a food order from you.  Uh-oh.  Every day I get the same thing.  Oh, my God.  Oh, shit.  I get scrambled egg whites every day.  Every day.  Oh, Eric.  I had no idea. 
[00:41:30]  I fucking eat every day.  I don't get your food usually, so I'm covering it today.  I didn't know that you got eggs.  That's why.  I can't eat.  Well, then how come?  Why didn't someone ask?  Like, why didn't someone ask?  You know he eats every day, right?  Every day I get the same.  Regardless of knowing what he gets or doesn't get.  You know he eats something every day.  Every single day.  Every food?  Kenny brings in.  Yes, I do.  It's the body's gasoline.  Yorick, are you assuming that he's not eating this morning because he didn't put in a food order?  No, I am not. 
[00:42:00]  I know Anthony's order is usually done when the show starts, but I didn't know that you ordered food ahead of time as well.  I thought you ordered during the first break.  Wait, he's always eating before the first break, though.  Yeah, and we take a break.  Is that a one-way glass?  Can we just see you?  Every day, it's the same thing.  Is that what's happening there?  Do you just see a reflection of yourself?  Do you pick up on anything?  You are.  A lot of times, Jimmy, holy shit.  It's the first hours during the first hour as soon as that food comes.  Yes, but it's not like it's once in a while. 
[00:42:30]  No.  It's literally every day that I'm sitting here.  Same time.  Yeah.  Every day, same thing.  There's times I'll turn off your mic so you can enjoy your food without the listeners hearing it.  Or I'll put it up in the air.  A lot of times, if you open it and talk it for a few minutes towards the end of the first hour, my mic is up in the air.  You're eating.  Sam, you think Yorick picks up on things?  He's not an observant guy.  Oh, my God.  I've never met a less observant person.  E-Rock?  That's scary, E-Rock.  I mean, it is.  Years have.  It's been years.  Years have gone by.  What were you thinking? 
[00:43:00]  You know he eats.  Every day.  I wasn't thinking anything.  I was thinking.  Exactly.  I was like that.  Oh, boy.  Wowie kazowie.  Are you going to stress eat now, E-Rock?  No.  Oh.  So where's the intern?  Can I place my letters?  Tell me what you want.  I'll have him run down right now.  Oh, and he's going to do your favor.  He's like that.  Oh, hey.  He's going to do you a favor.  Hey.  Now, look what he does for you.  I'm run down right now.  I'll order for the whole table.  Yeah.  Yeah, I'm running around. 
[00:43:30]  I'm going to get a bad tattoo.  I'm running down right now.  Okay.  What do you want?  Scrambled egg whites, please.  Oh, a little something new.  Oh, wow.  I'm going to try some scrambling.  We have three scrambled egg whites.  Shaking things up.  And can I have a little bit of Tabasco sauce on the side?  Do you want that now?  Yeah.  You know what?  Whenever he gets to it.  I figure normally I don't eat in the morning.  I'm fake shoveling white fluffy things into my mouth.  Can you take care of my gym buddy, please? 
[00:44:00]  Thank you.  I can't.  My gym buddy.  Wait, I got my line.  It's in his song I wrote.  Hold on.  That's all I have.  Sometimes E-Rock reflects on the day and isn't sure what was happening and what was his imagination.  He's actually writing O&A fan fiction.  Right.  It's like in his fiction, Jimmy doesn't eat during the first break.  And when he does, it's always BLTs.  Yeah, it's like BLTs and it's at like 10.  Yeah.  We do have the next one.  Go ahead.  No, you do yours. 
[00:44:30]  Okay.  Oh.  My gym buddy.  Throwing the steel like boom.  Sneaking a peek in the locker room.  Yay.  We're gym buddies now.  Oh, Jesus Christ.  That's our song.  That's your gym buddy song?  We worked on it all day yesterday through text messages.  Yes.  Yes, I joined.  Aw.  Throwing the steel like boom.  Sneaking a peek in the locker room.  So you're going to motivate each other?  Is that what is supposed to happen?  Yeah.  A lot of this.  A lot of that.  One more.  One more.  One more.  One more. 
[00:45:00]  You're putting donuts in your mouth?  We got a break now, I think.  When are you going to eat?  Yeah.  Can I get some coffee today?  Is that asking too much?  Don't overstress things.  Can I get a coffee, E-Rock?  Sure.  Why are you mad at me?  I didn't do shit.  I'm not mad at you.  Well, you did mention that he might be the least observant person you've ever had.  Well, it's a little weird.  It is creepy.  But then he gets mad for me picking up on weird shit.  I'm just stunned that, you know, there isn't much that needs to be done during that first break. 
[00:45:30]  You got your food?  I got mine.  Fuck all y'all.  Now, are you going to wait to eat until Jim gets his?  No.  Oh.  Hell.  Wait, I don't have food either, I just noticed.  Hey, what happened?  I was told you want either yogurt or cereal during the first break.  Nope.  Not true.  Okay.  Holy shit, where's my food?  You get nothing either.  Wow.  Why does Anthony get his food and then me and Jimmy, who eat at the exact same time every 
[00:46:00]  day, don't have food?  Anthony shoots people.  That happens.  Because your food is in the fridge in the back and in the cabinets.  Why would you have the guy bring it out?  Yeah, where's my food?  Oh, man.  Because there's a bunch of different cereals.  I was going to ask him during the first break which one you wanted.  I eat oatmeal today.  What if he wanted to mix and match?  I eat oatmeal sometimes.  What if he wanted fluffy eggs like some of us?  What if he wanted to eat before the first break is over?  There are times I eat some egg whites.  We're going to eat during the next break and people are going to be pissed. 
[00:46:30]  Whose fault is that?  P-Rock.  Oh.  Wow, I just looked to my right.  There's no food for me either.  Looking sad over there.  Should Eric do the show while you guys are eating?  That's not a bad idea.  Oh, man.  I mean, if you guys are getting me distracted by eating, the least we could do is maybe have  the virus come up with a punchline.  Oh, my God.  You know what?  That could work.  That's a great point, Sam.  We missed a fucking great line when we were railing on E-Rock about how his wife watches 
[00:47:00]  football.  She's a Giants fan and she watches the football and she's got the jersey and everything.  It's like somebody tweeted something to the effect of they both wear giant jerseys.  Fucking hilarious.  Oh, E-Rock.  He's not really that fat.  He's pretty fat.  Yeah, he's not, well, he's not trim.  Compared to.  Right.  My gym buddy.  Your gym buddy is going to be slim. 
[00:47:30]  Ooh.  Slim Jim.  Yeah.  Slim Jim, buddy.  We could add that to our song.  We're in the same locker room area.  Wow.  I think so.  It's like fucking Jerry and George.  They're shooting the shit.  Yeah, in the same locker room.  Yeah.  Ramon walking by.  Yeah.  Yeah.  We don't have to stand around like me with the shoes.  We don't have to stand around naked and have like chit chat and.  Oh, one leg up on the bench.  And they do it naked.  Just rubbing your balls with the towel.  Talking. 
[00:48:00]  And these guys do it like it's completely normal and acceptable.  That's so gay.  That is fucking weird.  It's homoerotic.  Me and Kenny changed.  We went.  I worked out and.  Why would you just put a towel on?  I don't get it.  Oh, I'm very comfortable just being naked, talking to another guy, chit chatting.  I don't like it.  About the election.  It's really strange.  It's absolutely a homoerotic thing that is in those guys' heads.  They like it.  Is it a totally gay thing or people get to the point in their lives where they just.  I don't know.  Are so comfortable just having their balls out. 
[00:48:30]  No, it's not even a comfort thing.  That's something that is like.  It is weird, man.  It's a very.  You see it a lot, too.  Me and Kenny were changed together because we went to this Lifestyles gym in Columbus.  Lifestyles.  Lifestyles.  I know, I know.  But we got to go to the family locker room because we weren't members.  We just had a day pass.  Oh, sure.  And they gave us lockers right next to each other.  And I always lay down a towel on the floor and step on it.  And then I'll always change again with my ass out, but nothing else.  But I went into the bathroom and changed. 
[00:49:00]  But Kenny, I could see he had a long shirt on, but I could just see his pale white legs.  You don't want to see that.  I don't want to see Kenny naked in his big tighty whiteys.  Oh, my God.  Shit, I got thrown out of that place.  Family locker room.  They're like, you can't film in here, Mr. Hargis.  I said, I'm making a documentary.  Mr. Hargis.  No smartphones. 
[00:49:30]  Yeah, that's just the weirdest thing.  The one fucking.  That's strange.  He's got yapping.  Put his foot up.  He's bent over.  Ugh.  Stop.  Yeah, I don't.  I don't get it.  But I've seen enough where I, is it like just accepted or is it totally a gay thing?  I don't know, man.  It could be both.  It could be depending on the guy.  A lot of guys, honestly, are not a fuck.  I know older guys don't give a fuck.  They're all the fucking bag hanging down on their knees. 
[00:50:00]  Athletes.  Most athletes probably don't care.  Because they've been doing it for so many years.  It's like, if you're like just a regular athlete and you've been fucking involved in sports,  it's not weird for you to shower.  You don't give a fuck probably after a certain point.  There are towels everywhere.  That's why I find it strange.  It's like.  The athlete.  You could get a towel in a second.  In a second.  It would be like.  Yeah.  No effort at all.  No need.  I don't know.  Whatever.  Whatever you're into.  You know.  What are you going to do?  Fuck.  What do you want to talk about next? 
[00:50:30]  Oh.  Well.  Obama on the view.  Oh.  Oh.  Did we have traffic?  Was there a lot of stuff shut down yesterday?  I know one part where we were up in our area was very, very congested.  And I think that's probably why.  Oh, yeah.  We're very close to the view where they taped that shit.  We live like four blocks.  Very close.  Obama and Romney in town today.  What's Romney doing?  That should be a fucking treat.  No, it shouldn't.  That's a lot of traffic.  The United Nations General Assembly is. 
[00:51:00]  It took me so long to just get off this fucking island yesterday.  Holy mackerel.  I had to go to the Queensborough Bridge.  And even, like, getting there was crazy.  They shut down the streets.  They put the cones in the middle of, like, 57th.  So they could just go zip in and out with the cop cars and everything.  Oh, it's a pain in the ass.  I don't understand how they treat these world leaders better than us.  And they fucking hate our country.  Yeah. 
[00:51:30]  So if they hate our country, at least let them deal with the bullshit we deal with.  Yeah.  Don't make it easier for them.  They certainly do.  There's a lot of convoys all over the place of SUVs.  Black SUVs with lights on them.  Guys in there with machine guns.  It's nuts.  I want to...  Is Ahmadinejad staying?  I love the outrage over here.  Staying at the Warwick?  Every time he's here.  Is he really definitely...  That's right over there.  Yeah.  He's definitely staying there?  I've heard he is.  We pass by that every day.  There's big police barricades around it.  Yep.  Wow. 
[00:52:00]  He's enjoying the comforts of New York City, but he hates us.  That's so weird to me.  That would be a good picture.  And who has to protect us?  I should have put him up at the Carter.  Who protects him?  NYPD mostly?  He's got his own guys.  He's got his own guys.  He's got his own guys.  He's got his own guys.  He's got his own guys.  He's got his own guys.  He's got his own guys.  Yeah, they all do.  We all do.  He was on Piers Morgan yesterday.  Piers?  Did you see that interview?  I missed that one.  He doesn't believe that the Holocaust happened, or he wants to research it or something.  Research it?  It needs more research, really.  Does it?  Doesn't think you're born gay.  What does he think? 
[00:52:30]  You become gay.  You turn gay?  Yeah.  Yeah, because you're into disgusting shit or something like that, he said.  And then, what was the other point he made?  He's never seen those fucking...  Oh, he loves humanity.  How does he?  Yes.  That's how the interview ended.  Can I tell you what I like about Ahmadinejad?  He loves humanity.  At least he says it.  He hates Israel.  And he hates Jews.  But at least he says it.  At least he's a guy. 
[00:53:00]  He's more honest than most of our politicians.  As much of a cocksucker as he is.  He was talking about how there are Jews in Iran.  How weird is that, to be Jewish in Iran?  And he says he knows, you know, and they'll marry Christians and Muslims, and he doesn't  have a problem with that.  He said that last night.  He just doesn't like that.  Imagine being Jewish in Iran.  That's got to be a scary life.  Oh, yeah.  Knowing the main guy hates your guts.  What does he just hate?  Israel?  It was a tough interview.  Really Jews?  It was a tough interview because they had the translator.  Sure.  Which makes it really strange. 
[00:53:30]  I'm never quite convinced that they're really giving you the whole quote and story.  Sure.  Yeah.  We got some clips from that?  Some short clips?  Piers.  Yeah, there's talking about homosexuality being ugly, the Iran Jews.  See, I told you.  Yeah, I'd love to hear a little bit about that.  All right.  That's a good thing we can talk about next.  He's basically trying to tell Piers he loves everybody.  Oh, what a guy.  He's highly intelligent, this guy.  But there is a huge but. 
[00:54:00]  He's very misinformed for whatever reason.  But he can tell he's very intelligent.  He said something in the interview.  I'm going to read the quote real quick.  Because it's like people have said that he's crazy and he's this, that.  He doesn't come across crazy, man.  He doesn't come across crazy.  He's not crazy.  Okay.  He's appeasing the mullahs in Iran and these religious truly fanatics.  No, the money, the mullahs.  Is E-Roc getting our breakfast? 
[00:54:30]  Because we're trying to stall here.  Does anyone realize this?  Where's the intern?  Oh, my God.  E-Roc.  Where's the intern?  He's right here with your breakfast.  He's walking around.  Okay, thank you, buddy.  Thank you.  And mine, too?  You never gave me an official order.  He said, I might want oatmeal.  And then you never told me what you wanted.  Wow, you really do hate oatmeal.  Hungry oatmeal.  I've been one of those for a while.  It's obvious.  You really do hate me.  Oh, boy.  Here comes Jimmy's breakfast.  Thank you very much, buddy.  Morning, Mr. Breakfast.  Did you send out for my coffee, at least?  Because I said that.  He's back here now, so he's going now. 
[00:55:00]  You couldn't text him while he was out and say, grab the ball.  Wow.  You so hate me.  He hates me.  Holy shit.  At least I know what I'm dealing with now.  At least I know what I'm dealing with.  He's very resentful.  Wow.  I didn't think it went past the radio show.  Oh, it does.  Dropping the ball.  He doesn't want you to eat or drink.  Well, if he's going to Starbucks, could he get the oatmeal, too?  Yep.  Fucking God.  Stay short with you.  Go ahead, Jimmy.  I'm sorry.  Oh, that's okay.  You had a legitimate question.  Do you want a coffee, too?  No, I certainly don't.  Why would I?  Okay. 
[00:55:30]  The Iranian president told CBS that the Iranians don't believe in nuclear weapons.  He said we're against it, according to the expert.  He noted that the United States has 5,600 modern bombs and opined, I guess, or said, what intelligent  person would fight 5,000 American bombs with one bomb?  So he's not a crazy person who's going to attempt to nuke the United States, and I never 
[00:56:00]  thought he was.  He's a smarter guy, even though I think his views are sickening and the Holocaust views  are shit, and he hates a good friend of ours, which is Israel.  He's not as crazy as people paint him out to be, and he's not as reckless.  He's a lot of shit-talking, just like Saddam was.  Saddam was talking a lot of shit because he was afraid of Iran, and he wanted them to think  he had a bomb.  Look where he is.  Yeah, I know.  It worked out well.  Yeah.  You think the rest of the world is really pissed that we have so many nuclear weapons? 
[00:56:30]  Some are.  Because we think we're doing the right thing, but, I mean, if you're somewhere else in the  world, you must look at us like a fucking asshole.  Yeah, who are you guys?  We needed them.  We had to.  No, I'm not arguing the point.  No, I mean, I'm an American.  I'm just saying from their point of view, they must be like, oh, really?  No one else is allowed, but you guys are allowed to have 5,600.  Sure.  From their point of view, they should shut the fuck up.  We needed to fucking get rid of that Soviet Union.  Yeah.  Those bastards.  And a cabbie told me 9-11 is a continuation of the Cold War with Russia. 
[00:57:00]  What a fucking ride that must have been.  And he told me to look it up.  Where?  Google it.  I don't know.  I just lost interest.  Of course.  And it was raining, and I needed to pay my fare.  Russian cabbie said, that's the real deal.  Continuation of Cold War.  He goes, you heard it here first, and we need to get the word out.  He doesn't even know what I do for a living, but he's like, you need to get the word  out.  Maybe it does.  KGB.  And he said, yeah, you know what?  Couldn't get a cab, and all of a sudden, this black car comes fucking rolling up. 
[00:57:30]  Might have been KGB.  Look out.  Damn.  The Cold War.  What was everybody throwing ice cubes at each other?  Hit it, you know breakfast getting big.  Sirius XM.  Sirius XM.  This is the Opinion Anthony Show.  No.  No.  No.  No.  No.  No.  No.  No.  No.  No.  No.  No.  No.  No.  No.  No.  No.  No.  No.  No.  No.  No.  Da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da.  We're back, I guess, huh? 
[00:58:00]  I'm supposed to go to traffic court today, and I can't make it.  I don't know what that means.  You're going to have a warrant out for my arrest?  Why do you have to go to traffic court?  I postponed it until now.  And all of a sudden, when you postpone something, it turns up.  What happened?  What happened?  This is that speeding ticket I got from that MTA cop on the expressway.  Oh, shit.  You're fighting it?  Well, yeah.  I was going to go in and just kind of say, hey, what do I owe you to not have points on 
[00:58:30]  my license?  Is that basically what you could say?  That's my strategy, usually, is go in there, pay through the nose, and...  You love using money to make everything go away, don't you?  Boy, do I ever.  It's not a bad strategy for having it.  If you can use that strategy, I highly recommend it.  You know, especially for points.  I just don't like having points in my life.  How do you do it, though?  Do you pull out your wallet?  Let's take care of this right here.  In Brainerd.  I know.  I didn't want to say Brainerd because I'm not in Brainerd, but that's what I was going 
[00:59:00]  for.  It's my tags.  Yeah, my tags.  Oh, very good.  Yeah, so I don't know what the fuck.  Look, I want to postpone it again.  I guess I could do that.  And it was an MTA guy, huh?  They're the worst of the worst.  Yeah.  I didn't even think he could give me a ticket.  That's why I flew past him.  I saw MTA on his car.  I'm like, ha ha, shut the fuck up.  Wow, my blow past him, and then...  What, do they have jurisdiction around the tolls? 
[00:59:30]  Everywhere.  Everywhere?  Who gave him that?  After 9-11, MTA...  Because it's not bridge and tunnel.  It's MTA.  Right.  It's different.  See, and I was confused at the time.  I'm just like, oh, he can't pull me over.  You know they control the city, right?  Oh, yeah.  In and out.  Those are the guys.  They kind of scare me, actually, because they absolutely control the city.  They do whatever the fuck they want, and our mayor can't do anything about it.  Yeah.  MTA.  Despicable.  They're raising the tolls again on, which one there?  Verrazano?  Was it the Verrazano? 
[01:00:00]  I think it is.  From 13 to 15?  That fucking disgusting.  $13,000 to $6,000 at crossing.  It's amazing.  They want to go from 13 to 15, and I think they just got 13 not that long ago.  They're disgusting.  Not that long ago.  Is that one way?  Yeah.  It's a one-way...  One-way tall, right?  Yeah.  I'm sure people are sick of me talking like this, but I do look out for the middle class.  Oh.  And I know I could afford that, but it's not about me.  I just...  I imagine the average person trying to make a living, how are they supposed to just pay 
[01:00:30]  15 bucks a day?  They need that bridge to get to their jobs.  Crazy money.  That's $75 a week just to go to work.  And then when you get in the city, you got to find a parking garage.  You can't park in the street anymore all day, for the most part.  Some people get...  You know, could figure that shit out.  And then you got the gas, obviously.  Yeah.  And then a lot of these guys are paying more than just the one toll.  I don't know...  I don't understand how logically the MTA people sit around and go, yeah, no, middle class 
[01:01:00]  could afford this.  What's the mayor trying to...  They're basically saying, fuck the middle class.  They don't give a fuck.  He's forcing you to use mass transit.  The way he's forcing you to eat better...  Jimmy, I agree, but he has nothing to do with the MTA.  Even if he went to the MTA and said, look, enough's enough, they would laugh at him.  Right.  They really would.  They completely control this shit.  This has nothing to do with the mayor.  It really has nothing.  But $15...  That's a lot of fucking money.  With all the bills people pay, now it's like, oh, $75 a week.  Really?  Just to cross a bridge. 
[01:01:30]  That's a lot of goddamn money right there.  It's unbelievable.  You pay taxes living there.  How does that not fix it?  It's stupid.  I can't even comprehend it.  Yeah.  I can't even comprehend it.  The MTA is probably the most incompetent and disgusting fucking organization in the city.  Port Authority's not great either, but...  And then we have just average shit.  You go to another city and their stuff's way better.  Yeah.  And they kill us at the tolls.  And we just have average shit.  Best it... 
[01:02:00]  Average roads.  Average fucking trains.  Yeah.  Average bridges for the most part.  Maddening.  There's always construction.  There's always something going on.  Yeah.  But anyway, you're going to the traffic corridor.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Why?  I don't know what to do.  Well, I can't now.  I got something else to do, but I can't go, and now I don't know what to do.  I guess I got to call them or something.  What do you have to do that's more important than making sure you take care of your ticket?  Well, I made an appointment to have my hair did. 
[01:02:30]  My fur did.  And it's at the same time.  You're kidding.  That's the best answer ever.  It's got...  Well, you know...  You're blowing off traffic court to get your hair did.  Yeah, because I have plans for tonight, you know?  What's going on tonight?  So I need my hair cut.  Nah, I'm just going out.  This is getting deeper and deeper.  Nah, I'm just going out.  I'm going out, and I need my...  I can't have my fucking mullet anymore.  Yeah, I'm going to fucking...  You know.  So you're blowing off traffic court. 
[01:03:00]  Well, I have to.  You're going to get arrested.  No, I can't get arrested.  I think I'm in trouble, too, because I found a pile of mail.  I had to fill out the questionnaire for jury duty.  What is that, the first step, really?  Yeah, I went through all that.  I just want to see where you are.  And I found this pile of mail for real, and it's from June.  So I'm like...  And they're like, you have to fill this out immediately and get it back to us?  Yeah.  So I did the old rip-a-roo.  Rip-a-roo.  That's how I make things go away. 
[01:03:30]  Yeah.  I just rip stuff up and throw it away.  I figure they'll have to send me another one.  Yeah, they will.  Can someone go in my stead?  Can someone go for me?  Yeah, you can have a little lawyer guy or something.  Do I need that, or can I just fucking pay somebody from here to go?  Who wants to go to fucking traffic court for me?  How much are you paying?  I don't know.  I'd love to go for you.  Oh, I'd fucking...  Oh, yeah.  I'd be arrested for rape.  Yeah, no.  Me and Jimmy will go down and represent.  Yeah.  We're going to get our suits on. 
[01:04:00]  What's the name of our law firm?  Oh.  It's got to be kind of catchy.  Gregorio and Chipperson.  Yeah, yeah.  Chip is just jailed for contempt constantly.  You think they would take that law firm seriously?  Gregorio and Chipperson.  Yeah, that sounds kind of, you know, ethnic.  Yeah.  Got to take the ethnic seriously, right?  Our client says, fuck the police.  Oh, Jesus Christ.  I am amazed you're blown off traffic court to get your hair did. 
[01:04:30]  Well, it's not so much for the haircut.  You're priceless, man.  I need the haircut because, you know, I'm going out.  I got fucking shit to do.  This guy's thanking...  And I can't have a mullet.  This guy's thanking me.  Dollar Bill.  Staten Island to Long Island every day.  Opie, thanks.  Yeah, but I'm just talking shit, too.  There's nothing we can do.  Nothing.  Because I was having visions.  How do we, like, turn this shit around?  Never.  You're done.  I would imagine there's groups that are getting together because they've had it. 
[01:05:00]  Yeah.  With how much it costs to commute in and around the city.  It's fucking maddening.  But then you're part of this group.  Then what are they able to do and accomplish?  This MTA, man, they're scary.  I'm telling you.  You see the guns they fucking have?  They got some shit.  I don't know.  My grandfather was a head engineer on the Verrazano Bridge when it was built.  Verrazano is what?  That's Brooklyn to...  Yeah, to Staten Island. 
[01:05:30]  Staten Island.  Is that that one?  Okay.  My mother used to say that's an arrow.  She couldn't say it right.  He made $12,000 per year.  That bridge has been paid for for years.  Of course.  Of course it has.  All that shit was supposed to go away when they paid for the bridge.  That's what happens with all those tolls.  They're like, oh, we just want to pay for it.  And then they're like, well, we got to maintain it.  Well, that's how they get you.  Well, we got to give money to education.  I love when they do that.  Well, you know, it's for education.  Then it gets just funneled somewhere else.  I would love to have much goes there.  Misappropriation, corruption, education, edumacation. 
[01:06:00]  It's a load of shite.  People say, they did the math.  $4,000 per year just to go over that bridge.  That's someone's bill every year.  They'd have to worry about $4,000 just to go over a bridge.  How do you do that?  And people are like, oh, but New York City is the greatest city in the world.  They just treat you like shit around here.  I don't even know why we put up with this.  I can't wait to get out of the city.  That's why I take the tunnel every day.  And it doesn't cost me anything. 
[01:06:30]  I drive through, the gate goes up, and I fucking just fly right through.  Good for you.  I haven't shelled out any money to those toll guys in years.  It's amazing.  Oh, yeah.  So what are we doing right now?  We got the Iran guy.  Mahmoud Ahmadinejad.  Oh.  Ahmadinejad, right?  Yeah.  We got Deepak coming in today.  Yes, Deepak Chopra.  And his son, Gotham.  For the documentary, it was called Decoding Deepak, which I saw a while ago. 
[01:07:00]  And Bob Gullab is in, and I'm really looking forward to Bob coming in.  He was in, he's a really good talker.  Bob's an entertaining guy.  You'll like Bob Gullab.  What are you doing?  You're setting us up for a while?  No, no, I'm actually not.  Bob's a stand-up I've known for many years.  I don't know if I know him.  He was in Goodfellas.  He had that one part in Goodfellas.  Yeah.  One of my favorite lines in the movie.  Of course it is.  It's hilarious.  And he knows Voss for 30 years, I mean, or 20 years.  Does he imitate Voss?  He's not that guy, right? 
[01:07:30]  No, that's Bob.  No, Bob, this is, that's Bob DeBona.  Why are you smiling, though?  Because I'm just thinking of Gullab.  Actually, no reason.  He talks a lot?  But he's funny.  He's not like, he's not an annoying talker.  He's like a fucking, he's like a guy.  All right.  Gullab is a guy.  Like, he looks like, he's always looked like he's 50 years old.  Always.  He's looked like he's 50 ever since I've met him.  But hasn't aged since then?  No, he looks exactly the same.  But he's just, he's just a fucking, he's just a dude.  Like, I like Bob Gollab a lot.  Very cool.  All right.  We got, we got the Piers Morgan interview. 
[01:08:00]  Everyone's talking about this.  So, yeah.  We got just a couple highlights.  And here's the first clip.  What is this one on?  Homosexuality.  Homosexuality.  Homos.  This guy has a little, he has a little twinkle in his eye, this guy.  Oh, he's very, um, uh, likable, uh, to, to people that, you know, don't know what the  fuck he, uh, is all about.  Yeah.  But he's, he's always very pleasant.  Well, Piers.  Smiling.  Piers is getting some shit because I think he said he's very likable to him or something 
[01:08:30]  like that.  And everyone's like jumping on, like, you're saying that to a guy that doesn't believe  in the Holocaust.  Yeah.  You sound crazy if you say something like that.  But if you look at him just as a human being and blow, you know, don't pay attention to  all that crazy shit he says, he does come across a bit likable.  Sure.  All these guys are.  That's how they get to where they are.  Right.  That's true.  Yeah.  They're all alpha males and they're all really good talkers and they're all eye contact  guys and touch you guys.  They all know how to do that.  I think that's what Piers was trying to say, basically. 
[01:09:00]  Of course, he's disgusted by this guy and what he believes in.  But if you didn't know what he did and you just saw him on the street, you'd go, wow,  that guy is kind of likable.  Right.  Sure.  Right.  Absolutely.  All right.  Here's the clip on homosexuality.  Shouldn't freedom and individuality and all those things also extend to people who just  happen to be gay, who were born gay?  They weren't made gay.  Wouldn't it be great for the president of Iran to say, you know something? 
[01:09:30]  Everyone's entitled to be whatever sexuality they are born to be.  That would be a great symbol of freedom.  Do you really believe that someone is born homosexual?  Yes, I absolutely believe that.  Yes, I do.  I'm sorry.  Let me ask you this.  Do you believe that anyone is given birth to through homosexuality?  Homosexuality ceases procreation.  Who has said that if you like or believe in doing something ugly and others do not accept 
[01:10:00]  your behavior, they're denying your freedom?  Who says that?  Who says that?  Perhaps in a country they wish to legitimize stealing.  You are a father of three children.  You are a father of three children.  A few percentage of them.  You have two sons and a daughter.  What would you do if one of them was gay?  These things have different ways. 
[01:10:30]  The proper education must be given, the education system must be revamped, the political system  must be revamped, and these must be also reformed and revamped along the way.  But if you, if a group recognizes an ugly behavior or ugly deed as legitimate, you must not expect  other countries or other groups to give it the same recognition.  See, the problem is...  That's pretty much, fuck you. 
[01:11:00]  We don't like gays.  We don't care how you feel about them here.  The argument should have been, Pierce should have mentioned to him, because Ahmadinejad said,  well, people are not, procreation is ceased by homosexuality.  But there are people who are born sterile and born completely infertile that can't have  children, so they cease procreation, so are you saying that that is something they become  by choice?  Student spanked by male teacher.  Oh, wow.  Holy shit. 
[01:11:30]  Oh, this is a great story.  That was over the weekend.  Can we get the audio of this?  Crazy, Jimmy.  How old is she?  She chose.  She chose to be spanked.  Oh, boy.  Oh, boy.  What a good girl.  Wow.  Because something to do with it, it would fuck up her permanent record or something  for what she did.  Well, he probably gave her a choice, spanking her this.  No, she went to him and said, look, can I take a spanking instead?  Wow.  And he's just like, hum-da, hum-da, hum-da.  She's pretty fucking hot.  Yeah.  How does everybody know, though?  And then she assumed that it was going to be a female that spanked her, and it turned  out to be the male teacher. 
[01:12:00]  Of course it was.  I believe that's how the story goes down.  I'll take care of this.  Yeah.  I won't do anything.  Yeah.  I won't make my employees do anything I wouldn't do.  But you're going to be on vacation.  That's all right.  I'll cancel it.  I'll come back.  Whatever it takes.  Yeah.  It's a day's off, Schmeade.  But it's a Sunday.  That's all right.  I'll come in.  I'm dedicated to the job.  Big rod.  Spare my rod.  Spoil the child.  The fucking news is really behind. 
[01:12:30]  Yeah.  Because this is like two or three days ago.  Unintentional.  I found it on my Twitter.  Unintentional hotness in the news.  Mom.  This was Heather Height.  I retweeted her tweet.  Unintentional hotness in the news.  Mom angry that male spanked child.  I didn't think.  It's ABC News there, Sam.  When I heard the story, I was picturing something a lot more ugly.  No, she's beautiful.  What a cutie there.  Yeah.  Good and blonde.  How old is she, though?  Sometimes you got to discipline. 
[01:13:00]  You want to know the story?  Sure.  Rather than spend two days.  Everyone comes together to do what we love.  I have been.  Texas school wants to make it easier to spank.  Oh, you got the actual audio clip?  I don't know if this is the same story or not.  Oh, my God.  Why don't you know yet?  I'm reading it.  And then you read yours, and then that way we can be synergizing.  What does yours say?  Oh, executive producer Sam just running everything.  That can't be the story.  Yeah, what's the headline?  That's the one. 
[01:13:30]  Male.  Oh, yeah, there you go.  Is there an actual audio of that girl?  Not in this story.  It was the video.  Fuck, here goes me trying to read.  Rather than spend two days in in-school suspension for allegedly letting another student copy her classwork,  she's a bad girl.  Taylor Santos, a well-regarded student and athlete at Springtown High School near Fort Worth, Texas,  chose to get paddled.  Oh, yeah, paddled.  As her mother, Anna, told ABC News, Taylor didn't want to miss any classes because her grades are very important to her. 
[01:14:00]  So Santos went to the vice principal's office to request a paddling.  Oh, yes.  Would you paddle my behind?  Did you think that guy just fucking lost his head?  He just lost right there in the office.  He just fucking came in his pants.  What was his first move?  A big gulp?  Yeah.  Did he just drop whatever he was working on?  Like, all right, let's go. 
[01:14:30]  What do you think?  What is his move?  Miss Jenkins, hold all my appointments.  Close his curtains as he was trying to contain his excitement.  You think his hand was shaking a little bit?  I think we need to read every word of this.  Oh.  It's, uh, okay, here we go.  So Santos went to the vice principal's office to request a paddling.  She called her mom, who said that as long as her daughter was okay with it, so was she. 
[01:15:00]  What the fuck is going on?  Idiots.  It's craziness.  So I guess the vice principal called the mom.  Oh, he checked at the time?  And the vice principal is the she in this story.  She called her mom.  According to school policy, parents who don't want their children subject to corporal punishment  must submit a written statement each year.  What neither the mom nor Santos knew was that a man, the vice principal, would be doing the 
[01:15:30]  swatting while a female watched.  Oh, there you go.  You know those two made a deal in some bar somewhere?  Aren't you?  Yeah, yeah.  Watch.  And video it.  This story rules.  Jim's got a rod.  Jimmy just stood up.  Jimmy.  But break it down.  They probably went to a bar one day and went, look, I know what you're into, and you know  what I'm into.  Yeah, yeah.  I think we can work something out here.  Yeah, I'll do the spanking.  I'll do the spanking. 
[01:16:00]  This is a paddling, though.  It's not as, uh...  Oh, yeah, well...  As far as Jorgensen knew, she said school policy mandated that males spanked males and  females spanked females.  Oh, yeah, there it is.  Because of the force with which Santos was struck, her bottom was fire engine red.  Oh!  This guy enjoyed spanking her and looked as if it had been burned and blistered.  Mmm.  Look at that.  Said Jorgensen, who took photos as evidence. 
[01:16:30]  Oh, man.  I want to see them.  We'll go to the audio story in a second.  Oh, teen girl spanked for cheating.  Oh, look at that.  She has a fucking little smoking body on her.  Little pink, uh...  How old is she now?  Tank top.  She's probably 15, 16, I would imagine.  Another student, Jada...  Jada, I guess Jada Watson said she smarted off to the same male vice principal and received  the same punishment, which was observed by a male police officer.  Oh, boy.  Her mother, Kathy, said she wasn't expecting a bruise. 
[01:17:00]  By the way, what kind of backwards, shitty fucking school in Texas allows corporal punishment  at this point?  It's crazy.  Well, Jimmy, while paddling in public schools has been outlawed by 31 states, there's 19  still holding on.  Yeah.  Wow.  19 states.  I'm sure they're all in the south and the southwest.  As well as by Washington, D.C. and Puerto Rico.  Even Puerto Rico's like...  Puerto Rico.  Puerto Rico's even saying no fucking way.  Yeah. 
[01:17:30]  It's legal in 19 states.  Efforts to ban it in Wyoming, North Carolina, Louisiana, and Texas have failed.  Ah.  They're holding strong.  However, in 2011, their laws were introduced in both Texas and North Carolina, giving parents  the right to exempt their students from paddling.  I'll tell you right now, fucking some principal paddles my kid and they say it's legal, I will  beat the shit out of the fucking principal.  Oh, man.  And I will go to jail.  That would never happen here.  No fucking principal or teacher is paddling my kid for misbehaving. 
[01:18:00]  Well.  Yeah, it won't happen here.  How is that legal in 19 states?  This girl was naughty.  Oh, how naughty of her.  Oh, you got the spanking story, Danny?  Yeah, I think it's the same as we are.  Oh, okay.  Let's go to the audio and see if they can make it as hot as we are.  Yeah, because I have a pounding rod.  Oh.  Yeah, it's really tumescent.  Yeah, I'll spank her.  Santos is a sophomore with good grades.  Oh, softball, she's too young.  North of Fort Worth, Texas. 
[01:18:30]  But after she got caught helping another student cheat, Taylor got a paddle to the backside.  I still have whelps on me today.  Taylor and her mother actually chose corporal punishment over a day-long suspension.  They're not outraged she was spanked, but by who did it?  Her male vice principal.  Whoa.  Men are too big and strong to be hitting 96-pound girls.  Jada Watt is a year ahead of Taylor at Springtown High.  What?  Why does she look younger?  She looks younger, really.  She started off to the same male vice principal with the same result. 
[01:19:00]  A swat is a swat.  Yes, it is.  And they do sing.  But to bruise a child?  Texas is one of 19 states that allows corporal punishment in schools.  Hold on, Paul.  Look at this map.  Yeah, look at the map.  What is up with you people in the south?  Look at that map.  It's all the southeast and then a few other states.  Whose case?  California and what's that other one?  I don't know.  California, Nevada, Utah, New Mexico. 
[01:19:30]  No, what's the one in the white right next to Texas?  Is that where Oklahoma is?  New Mexico?  New Mexico?  No, New Mexico is that one.  To the left of Texas.  Yeah.  And what's the one left of that one?  Arizona.  So Arizona, yes.  Texas, yes.  Colorado, yes.  New Mexico says hell nah.  Yeah, Oklahoma, Texas.  And then it's red all the way to Florida.  How does that happen?  And South Carolina.  And fuck these mothers.  You allowed your kid to be spanked in school.  Don't cry about it now. 
[01:20:00]  They checked with you and you said, well, we thought what you should have said is, no,  you can't hit my kid, you fucking bag of shit.  Under any circumstance, you fuckers.  Ugh.  There are times I want to hit my kid.  Trust me.  But no one's hitting my fucking kid.  Sorry.  And do you really need to put...  And I don't hit my kid, by the way.  I got to make that...  You think you're shaking him though?  You get like you're pissed off, right?  Of course.  Just about...  If you're a parent and you say you don't think that shit, you're crazy.  You're lying.  Excuse me.  Really need to be lying.  What does he do that makes you want to...  Sexy girl like that?  No, it's just...  It's just frustration. 
[01:20:30]  Not listening?  Yeah, their brains are not developed yet.  They think it's hilarious to kick the shit out of you while you're changing their diaper  when you're exhausted and want to just go to bed.  Something that should take maybe 30 seconds takes five minutes.  Imagine that.  But I ain't hitting my kid, no.  Right.  Damn.  You want to.  Yeah.  And sometimes you think, well, maybe this will get some things done.  Yeah.  Corporal punishment.  I thought I would hit my kid, to be honest with you.  Yeah?  Yeah.  All these years before I was a parent, I was like, yeah, I think I could hit my kid. 
[01:21:00]  I think that's a way that you could discipline a kid.  And there are parents out there that absolutely do, and I'm not even questioning that.  If that's what you need to do and you think it's right, whatever.  Yeah.  But I've realized after having my kid that there's no fucking way I could do that.  It's only uppercuts, I think.  To a little kid, you just uppercut them.  I don't know if I could or not.  We were all hit as kids, and I don't know.  Who didn't enjoy that?  Come on.  Right, kids?  Everyone.  So, what?  I think it's a little twisted, to be honest with you.  Yeah.  It is. 
[01:21:30]  I don't know.  Or it should only be used in extreme cases.  Like, if the kid goes to run out, like, in traffic or something, I think hitting him then is okay, simply because there should be a reinforced message.  Daddy's going to disapprove of you is not a strong enough deterrent for him possibly doing something that will get him killed.  I don't disagree.  It's strange.  I don't know what's right.  If the young lad takes interest in mom's clothes, let's say. 
[01:22:00]  Yeah.  A nice belt to the face, huh?  Well, no.  I don't know about that.  Of course not.  If he disagrees with you politically, I think he disagrees with you.  Yeah, so that, of course, yes.  Because the time out thing is kind of silly.  We do the time out thing, but.  Does it work?  And then I list all the things he can't get.  So, you know what he does?  He recites them back to me.  He's already mocking me.  Yeah, it's mocking you.  He's already mocking me.  Yeah.  Because I'll tell him no, I used to tell him no pacifier, no park, no ice cream.  And he'll recite it back to me. 
[01:22:30]  I go, when he knows he's in trouble, he'll just go, no pass, no park, no ice cream.  With that look on his face.  He's like punishing himself.  He knows like, all right, I know what's coming.  Yeah.  But he knows it's a joke.  It means nothing to him.  In that moment, it means nothing to him.  You get so frustrated, dude.  It's really frustrating.  What does he do that's frustrating, though?  Like, I don't have any.  Is he just not listening or making noise?  Yeah, he's a two and a half year old.  I mean, you know, and you want him to, like, I don't know, like, just calm down or whatever. 
[01:23:00]  You know?  Or he'll throw food or something.  You know, just dumb shit.  And just like, ah!  Don't throw food!  You're trying to relax, all of a sudden you just see fucking meatloaf flying on the sofa.  I think he finally understands that, you know, he doesn't throw food anymore, so we got past that one.  Throwing food, Jesus.  Yeah.  He's a good kid in general, though.  We've all done that, though. 
[01:23:30]  Yeah, it's like you paint the wall with pudding or whatever.  It's like, just do it.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Why not?  But anyway, back to the spanker.  Oh, but yes.  It's, uh, man, the South loves their spankings.  Yeah, they love spanking the kids.  The whole stupid South.  Yeah.  God, you guys, come on with the stereotype behavior.  Do you really allow, you really want a stranger in school hitting your fucking kid?  And if you're a parent of that girl, like, wouldn't you look and say, all right, look,  she's reaching a point where it could be sexualized if she's spanked. 
[01:24:00]  This isn't exactly like a little kid in fucking, uh, you know, some fucking little class playing  with blocks.  And you're like, oh, no, no, no.  Well, the two girls in this story, the one that's older doesn't look like a woman yet.  No, she looks young.  The other one looks older, definitely older for her age, right?  You motherfuckers.  Yeah, I didn't know she was that young.  Oh, sorry.  All right, go back to the story.  I say that all the time.  So the South loves their spankings. 
[01:24:30]  That's where the 19 states are mostly.  The school superintendent tells ABC News in both cases, his administrators followed Texas  law, but they violated their own school policy, which states spanking a student can only be  done by an employee of the same sex.  Jada says not only was she paddled by a male vice principal, it was observed by a male  police officer.  Two men giving her a swat behind closed doors. 
[01:25:00]  That is creepy.  Tonight, school officials actually plan to ask the board.  You're an idiot.  You're a shitty parent for allowing it.  You really are.  You're a shitty parent for saying yes to that ever.  I agree.  Don't blame the cop or the guy, you bug-eyed zilch.  You're a shitty fucking parent.  Exactly.  Completely agree.  Yes.  Completely agree.  That's kind of creepy.  Here's what's creepy.  Kind of creepy.  That the mother would have said yes to that, that you wouldn't exempt your kid from corporal  punishment every year.  You're the fucking creep.  I'd be outside the school with a bullhorn at that point. 
[01:25:30]  Not saying, yeah, it's kind of creepy to a news guy.  I would be all about that.  She allowed it.  Of course she did.  Even though she thinks it's going to be the same sex.  But you're allowing another person to hit your fucking high school student kid.  Everyone in the school understands what's going on.  You got the one girl with the pink top and stuff.  She dresses sexy and she looks older than she is.  All of a sudden she requests a spanking.  You know the guy goes, well, I'll do this one. 
[01:26:00]  I'll do it.  I'll do this one.  And you know all the female teachers especially roll in their eyes like, God, we all know what  this is about.  Yeah.  He's not spanking the big chubby girl because she took too many cookies from the lunchroom.  Fatso had too many butter cookies in her pockets.  I don't think he's volunteering for that one.  He's all pissed.  What is that private pile?  Stop it, Jelly Donuts, sir.  He's just pissed at the students for eating.  Yeah. 
[01:26:30]  More to this story?  Yeah, 10 seconds.  Yeah.  We'll fight that.  Saying their daughters are proof men should not hit women under any circumstances.  Well, let's slow down.  Morning America.  Ryan Owens, ABC News.  With a hard on here in Springtown, Texas.  The boner.  Men shouldn't hit women in any circumstance, but adults should hit kids under some circumstances.  Sure.  Yeah, sure. 
[01:27:00]  Well, the phones are lit, but I don't know.  Who's answering the phones today, Yorick?  Probably another intern.  Oh, Sal.  Oh, Sal stinks.  He's not great, is he?  What's wrong with the phones?  I don't know what these guys want to talk about.  Oh, we see all the lines in here.  Oh, Sal doesn't say.  Oh, God.  Sal.  Mars stinks.  Come on, Sal.  I'm changing my opinion.  Mars stinks, not Sal.  Neither of them are great.  Because something's wrong with my phone over here.  You should take line five, dude.  All right.  Why?  Shut up.  Why?  He has a story about him being spanked.  Cool. 
[01:27:30]  Oh, you like that kind of stuff?  Oh, so you like the mail calls there on this topic?  Why would you want a woman, you fruit?  Life is no woman at all.  I don't know who you are because I can't see shit.  Yellow.  Yellow.  Oh, my God.  Sal's yelling at E-Rock.  What happened?  It's locked.  No, my phones are fucked up.  Hang on.  I'm going to rip this screen out.  Give me a second.  Oh, E-Rock. 
[01:28:00]  E-Rock, what did you do?  Not us.  E-Rock.  These computers are terrible.  Oh, no, no, no.  It's never the monitor.  It comes to look.  When you get mad at a computer, remember, it's never the monitor.  Can we pick them up that way?  Yes.  Ah.  How do we do that?  You want me to do it?  We lost five, which I guess was the best story.  Well, E-Rock found it exciting.  It was a guy who'd been spanked.  With a hoagie.  A guy who used to get a tiny spank with a hoagie. 
[01:28:30]  Why don't we have a phone from 1985?  Just tell me which line you want to talk to.  None.  Five was the one, I thought.  Clunk them down.  How about we just pick one?  Why don't you just plunk one randomly, Sam?  Fucking.  Hello?  Hello?  Welcome aboard.  Oh, it works that way.  Nice.  Who's this?  This is Andrew from Long Island.  Andrew.  All right.  Tell us your hot spanking story.  Wow.  Okay.  I was going to call out Ope on something. 
[01:29:00]  Uh-oh.  Go ahead.  All right.  So, Ope, I got a two-and-a-half-year-old, right?  And I got a one-year-old also.  And you said you would never hit your kid, right?  Yeah.  I think...  That's what he testified to, sir.  Yeah.  All right.  So, I'm saying that I said the exact same thing.  I'm like, there's no way I'm ever going to hit my kid.  And when you have a two-and-a-half-year-old and you got a one-year-old at home, you're  saying something that takes you five...  Something that takes you 30 seconds actually takes you five minutes.  You get really frustrated and you say, yeah, I'm never going to do it. 
[01:29:30]  The second your kid starts to wail on your little kid and you got another one coming,  your mind just changes, man.  You just go from like, oh, yeah, I'm never going to do this to like, holy shit.  How am I going to handle this?  So, that was your limit.  That was my breaking point.  Yeah, because I'm not at that point.  I mean, I'm going to have a kid any fucking hour at this point, by the way.  I'm very distracted, if you haven't noticed.  But, um...  You said that if some guy hit your kid, you would kill that guy. 
[01:30:00]  You would go to...  Oh, yeah.  It would be over.  I would have a major problem on my hands.  I know that.  When your two-and-a-half-year-old starts wailing on your little kid, you're going to be like,  What?  See, this is a scenario...  Joel Steinberg, by the way.  ...on the phone.  But this is a scenario I never even thought of.  He sounds like a sane guy.  Yeah.  And then he, uh...  Here's a new scenario I haven't even thought of.  Listen, I didn't grab my two-and-a-half-year-old and start wailing on him.  I took his hip wrist and, like, put my two fingers on him.  I'm like, no.  But, like, I never in my life thought I would ever do that. 
[01:30:30]  And it just...  You know, it was just looking like another kid was wailing on my other kid.  Like, I had to do something about that.  Well, I said, but we heard the story wrong.  He's like, when I saw my two-and-a-half-year-old hitting the one-year-old,  he began helping.  Because that one-year-old was misbehaving, and he's like,  they don't hit hard enough at two-and-a-half to really get a good shot at him.  You know what you do?  You pick up the younger child by the ankles with one hand  and beat the older child with the younger child.  Yeah, or you hand the older kid a curtain rod and say, do it right. 
[01:31:00]  Do it like I do to mommy.  God, that's like...  That's a scenario I didn't even think of.  That's...  God, more shit to think about.  Oh, dude, you have no fucking idea what you're in for.  One is like a cakewalk.  Dude, I look at people with one kid, and I'm like, you're not fucking parents.  Wow.  Not even a parent.  No, you have two parents.  Dude, three, it's no problem.  You got the mom and the dad.  You got the double team.  Once you move to the man defense, you're screwed.  And my brother says, what is it? 
[01:31:30]  One kid is a...  One kid is a double team.  Two kids is the man.  Man on man.  And that three kids is zone coverage.  Oh, yeah.  That's when you're really fucked.  Three is when you're really fucked.  Because if you have two, you can go, all right, I'll watch this one.  You watch that one.  Right.  Yeah, but that's still even fucking crazy.  I mean, it's impossible.  I mean, it's impossible with one.  By the way, if you hit your kid, you know, whatever.  I'm not saying the world shouldn't hit their kids.  Because who am I?  I'm just saying, I just can't imagine hitting my kid. 
[01:32:00]  But now you're giving me a scenario where it might get close to where I just might.  I'm saying, dude, I felt like such an asshole after that.  I was like in bed.  I'm like, what the fuck did I do?  I screwed this kid up for life from just taking two fingers on his wrist.  So they get over it.  I mean, he's two and a half.  He like, you know, came over me five minutes later.  He was like, Daddy, let me be...  And we know, whatever.  And that's where you have to say, no, Daddy doesn't love you anymore.  The worst parenting tips ever.  Go to your room, sit down, and cry in the bed.  I don't love you.  You're terrible. 
[01:32:30]  Yes, go in the garage and put your face behind that hose and breathe deep.  Bad boy.  Yeah, you're a bad boy.  Go sit on Uncle Paul's lap.  Yeah.  I straighten everybody out.  Oh, sure.  No hitting.  All right, sir.  Sure, Sam.  Good touching it.  You sure you don't want to have kids in?  Positive.  This is like...  Gives you the shivers.  Oh, I couldn't imagine.  Clunky dance.  Stop.  You know, a shitload of boxes have arrived at my apartment because we're doing all the online... 
[01:33:00]  Fashion week.  All the online shopping for the new kid.  I get it.  And my son, it was really sad.  Like, he was telling the help yesterday.  Oh, boy.  The help.  That all these boxes are for baby sister.  Oh.  It felt so bad.  Oh, no gifts.  He's so aware that something is coming that is going to change his fucking world. 
[01:33:30]  And he goes, yeah, all these boxes are for baby sister.  Oh, no.  It was kind of a sad little moment.  I figured I'd change it.  Oh, he's going to be like, oh, man, that's it.  I'm old.  Just reinforce, though.  Yeah.  And the kid will be asking the housekeeper, what does it mean when dad does say, you no  longer the priority?  Oh, boy.  If you want.  Can you see the screen?  The phone screen?  Yeah.  Oh, okay.  No, I can't see what they want to talk about.  We have the guy, the first guy who Urock wanted to hear about his hot spanking story. 
[01:34:00]  Yeah.  And we have a girl.  So there's your gosh.  Get the girl!  Yeah.  Which one is the girl?  Let's go, girl.  All right.  Don't get down.  No, I'm not going to do it if you touch me.  Yo.  Yo, girl.  Hi.  Hi there.  We don't know your name because I can't see shit.  How you doing?  Megan.  Megan from DC.  Oh, I know Megan.  She's a regular.  Hey, Megan.  I pay attention, man.  You're a regular?  She's a regular.  Yeah, I just talked to Sam on his show on Sunday. 
[01:34:30]  Why don't you tell us what happened, Meg?  What was this spanking about?  Um, well, I was a teacher in Texas.  Yeah.  And...  Congrats.  We're on a radio show.  Wow, you spank kids.  Well, okay, no.  You sick fuck.  What had the boy done?  I was a high school teacher, and it said in our contract that we could do corporal punishment,  which kind of blew my mind, because I was teaching, um, senior boys.  Holy shit, Megan.  Go ahead. 
[01:35:00]  What do they say happens if you're disciplining one and he comes on your thigh?  You know that has happened.  Has to.  Yeah, and I was, I was like 25 when I started, and, um...  So, in theory, I was allowed to hit these 17 and 18-year-old boys if I wanted to, and,  um, but, I mean, that was, I, there was no saying in the thing, in the contract saying  that females couldn't hit males or the other way around, but, yeah, I don't have a great  story. 
[01:35:30]  That was about it.  Wait, you didn't hit him?  No.  Oh, we wanted, uh, the, the payoff.  I can be, all right, I can make something up if you want.  No, no, no.  Yeah, make up a scenario where you hit his cock head.  But, you know what, let's see what you would come up with.  Yeah.  Yeah, yeah.  Make it sexy, though, Megan.  You know what we're looking for.  Yeah, what happened?  You want all the features, what you're wearing.  What happened?  Yeah.  Uh...  Make your body way better than it probably is.  Yeah.  Say something like, what was happening?  Like, you know, Jerome was talking.  Yeah, yeah, yeah, let's do this.  And you told him to clap the erasers. 
[01:36:00]  Let's start with this one time and make it up.  Okay, well, I did teach all of these football players, for real.  Oh, right.  And there were several that, you know, I mean, they were, they were 18.  It was perfectly fine to think that they were cute.  I was 25, right?  Oh, wow.  So, um, uh, this is a lot of pressure, guys.  That's okay.  So far, I got a fucking, my full rod is back.  So, this young gentleman of color, what happened? 
[01:36:30]  Yeah, were you rapping at the end to have, like, Goldie Hawn and fucking Wildcats?  Could you say ample bosoms in your story?  Oh.  That'll get me going a little bit.  Just say ample bosoms.  Okay, so there's this...  Hey, what do you need?  Wait.  I need, I need you to add ample bosoms into this story.  What do you need, Anne?  Um...  I do have ample bosoms.  I sent you guys a picture once.  You liked it.  You talked about it for a while.  Oh, we did?  Yeah.  Anne, what do you need?  Uh...  Because Jimmy already knows what he needs, you fuck. 
[01:37:00]  I, um...  So, you need ample bosoms.  I need, uh...  Add it to the story, yes.  Something with her, her, her tight ass.  What kind, though?  Not bubbly, right?  What?  No, no, just a nice, you know...  Right.  Run-of-the-mill...  Right.  White girl's ass.  Right, there you go.  Jimmy, what do you need?  Jimmy, Jimmy, what do you need?  Somehow I need you to say...  While a...  While a log of shit poked out the bottom of my skirt. 
[01:37:30]  What?  What?  He basically wants you to say that you're turtling.  That you got a little log poking out.  While a log of shit poked out of the bottom of my skirt.  I need you to use that phrase.  Jimmy, I'm not...  Out of the bottom of the skirt.  You know how long...  How fucking funny would that be?  Do you know how long a log has to be to still be attached poked out of the bottom of your skirt? 
[01:38:00]  You got all that, Megan?  Apple boobs, or bosoms.  Fucking nice, tight ass, and a log that's poking out of the skirt.  Yeah, it's poking out of the bottom of her skirt.  It's hanging down.  That means you got one that you might have to cut free.  Yeah, that's a long one.  Oh, oh.  All right?  All right, I think it's obvious you guys don't really need me for this story.  Megan, you can do this.  Isn't that true?  Just a quick story where you work all three, and I know you can do this. 
[01:38:30]  All right, so there's this football player, and, you know, he hadn't done his workbook pages.  Oh, boy.  Oh, boy.  That big retard.  You know, I asked him to stay seated after class.  Oh, yeah, and you waited for everyone else to leave?  See, we're going to help you along here.  This is going to work, Megan.  And he said, I have no choice.  I'm in a wheelchair.  And then I would assume the guy, see, we can help you through this story because you're a little nervous.  Now the guy's going, whoa, yo, teach, why are you keeping me behind? 
[01:39:00]  I got another class to get to.  You know, he's a little bit angry.  He's defiant.  Right.  And it's the 50s, so he's got, like, the leather jacket on.  Oh, Jesus.  It's fucking, yeah, it's somebody from the Lords of Flatbush.  Spanked fucking ducky.  Yeah, he's got the, you know, the cigarettes rolled up in his, um.  Oh, right.  All right, so what happens, Megan?  Maybe he did something wrong.  What did he do wrong?  Maybe there was a new student with special needs, and she did something wrong. 
[01:39:30]  And he kicked her in the cunt.  I don't know why.  We used to have sexy stories on this show.  What happened?  I'm doing my best.  You guys keep interrupting with shit stories.  I'm sorry.  I don't know.  No, so maybe he kicked the special needs student in the cunt, and you have to have him stay up to class.  Yeah, right.  That's sexy.  All right, so.  So he's sitting there. 
[01:40:00]  And I go over and I lean over the desk, right?  Because I always wore, you know, low-cut sweaters.  Oh, nice.  Oh, really?  Why would you do that?  Nice.  Yes.  Because it keeps their attention, you know.  Yeah, that's where you can add the fucking ample bosom thing.  Oh, man.  Exactly.  Yes.  So what happens?  You lean over the desk, and what happens?  His remaining breath spills out.  See, I don't feel like Jimmy's in a sexy mood.  No, I am.  I am.  I'm sorry.  What happens? 
[01:40:30]  Yeah, what happens?  And so then he kind of raises his head, and he looks at me, and he says, I just didn't want to do the homework.  Right?  Yeah, really?  So then I just lift up my hand, and I just smack him across the cheek.  Oh, shit.  What does he do?  What's his reaction?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Yeah.  Well, he's startled, but then he's a little bit excited, and he looks back at me, and he looks like it almost like he wanted me to do it again or something.  It was really weird.  And then he goes, that don't make no sense.  Jimmy, you're fucking a bar story. 
[01:41:00]  I ain't doing no homework, teach.  All right, what happens next?  You slap his face.  You completely overreact.  She says, I don't want to do the homework, so I take a pencil, and I jab at his cothole.  I'm sorry.  Go ahead.  And it's Texas, right?  So I take out my gun, and I put it against his temple, and they tell me again about the homework. 
[01:41:30]  All right, now Anthony's turned on.  Oh, yes.  Anthony's now hard.  I know.  See, I'm working on that.  No, go ahead.  I'm sorry.  Am I done yet?  No, you haven't even started.  You slapped the boy.  He didn't do his homework.  Yeah.  So then he kind of, but then he started to, you know, he was a little angry still.  And so then he kind of shoved me back a little bit.  But it didn't make me mad, because it was kind of exciting, right? 
[01:42:00]  Oh, with his retard strength.  Yeah.  Giant cock.  He shoves you back.  This guy really is in a wheelchair.  Is that what we're doing?  Yes, and he shoves you back by your thighs, and you fall over a chair, crack your femur.  Oh, Lord.  You guys, I guess I got a little idea.  He's got a giant tongue.  Yeah.  He's licking your pussy like a salt lick.  You're spanking him, and his hiney smells bad because he's been in a chair all day. 
[01:42:30]  Stinky wheelchair ass.  Hey, Megan.  Yeah.  Does your last name start with the letter K?  No.  Oh.  Okay.  Someone sent me a story from 2009 of a teacher named Megan in Texas who was fired and charged  for having an improper relationship with a student.  Ah.  Yeah, I left Texas in like 2007, so that wasn't me.  Yeah, I never actually did anything.  But it's true that, you know, those boys were kind of cute at 18. 
[01:43:00]  Ah, you were looking.  All right.  See?  And it only goes to prove that a teacher would look at the girls and think that they were  attractive, and when he's spanking them, he's probably getting turned on.  Right.  Well, yeah, I did that, too.  Should we go to E-Rock's number one call on this topic now?  Megan, thank you.  Always a pleasure when you call the show.  She's gone?  All right.  Who's this?  Yo.  Hey.  Who are you, man?  I'm Dave from Boston.  Right on. 
[01:43:30]  Dave.  What's up, Dave?  Yeah.  Hey, man.  Just a quick story about the whole spanking thing.  Thanks a lot.  Just stop.  I was in junior high school and taking a mandatory typing class, and I'm in there, and I got into  a fight with a kid, and they said, I'm a fucking principal, and the guy asked, it's a voice  principal, and the guy asks, you want detention, or do you want the paddle?  And I said quickly to myself, geez, my mother's a teacher.  I don't want anyone to hear. 
[01:44:00]  They used to announce that shit over the loudspeaker, and I don't know if for some reason  that bothered me.  So I said, all right, I'll take the spanking.  This fucking guy is an ex-tank commander from Korea.  He's about six foot six, with a big bald head, with those Kojak yellow glasses.  Brings me into the office and says, you know, brings the witness in, grabs my loop of my  pants.  Let's me choose my own paddle, by the way.  I grabbed the paddle, and, you know, the cretins from Woodshop would make him paddles that are 
[01:44:30]  aerodynamic, with holes in it.  Oh, with the holes in it, yeah.  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah, wind-resistant, I guess.  Guy jacked me up with my belt loop, right?  And I braced, and my ass cheeks are puckered, and I'm waiting for this impact.  But he does it like a golf swing.  So he comes and just touches the ass first, and then brings it back, whack, at number  one.  And I'm like, whoa, well, that wasn't too, too bad.  And by the time I'm kind of coming back from that, whack, again, I get another one that 
[01:45:00]  I completely didn't expect.  And let me tell you something, fellas.  This was at the end of school, at the end of the day.  I went back at home, took a look at my ass, it looked like I just sat on a fucking stove.  That was a painful decision.  Two shots he gave you?  Two, yeah.  And I actually leaned against the wall afterwards, and I was like, whoa.  So, yeah, that's something I definitely fucking wouldn't recommend to any kid today.  It was the first and last time I took a paddling. 
[01:45:30]  Wow, great story.  Paddling sounds like it's nothing much going on, you know?  A little like, oh, a little paddling.  That could be very detrimental, yes, yes.  Yeah, a little like paddling.  By the way, Jim, my life's mission now is to work in the phrase, kicked in the cunt.  God, please do.  It's a fun one to say.  It's a fun one to say.  All right, sir.  Good story there.  Boston checking in, Dave.  Patriots got fucked over the weekend, didn't they?  No. 
[01:46:00]  What?  I don't know.  I don't think that fucking field goal was good there.  That looked good to me.  No, it didn't.  From my point of view.  No, it didn't.  I was home watching something else.  Oh.  We got the Deepak Chopra coming in.  Yes.  What does he do?  He like fucking...  He loves meditation.  I like meditation.  Maybe he could fucking have us all meditate.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  But he has to talk us through it because it's radio.  He's gotten some criticism, but, you know, like some people think that he doesn't respect 
[01:46:30]  the scientific method.  What is...  Because he doesn't believe so much in over-medicating.  He more believes in people, you know, energies and keeping negative energy out of your life  and listening to your...  That shit works, man.  How do you do that?  Do you lock yourself in a fucking room?  No, it's a way of thought.  It's a process.  It's Reiki.  Yeah.  Reiki, where you use your own energy to heal your own fucking body.  Reiki.  You ever read The Secret? 
[01:47:00]  No.  Oh, sure.  Yeah, it's a secret.  You don't tell nobody.  Let's ask him about the Reiki because they don't even touch your body and they get the  energy going.  I don't get that.  I don't know if I believe it.  Yeah, I'm not saying I do either, but that's what Sam's referring to.  It's Reiki.  I had a massage therapist once and I'm paying her to rub my shit and I open my eyes because  it was 10 minutes with nothing going on and she has her hands above my fucking body.  Fuck that.  Start rubbing.  I'm feeling your energy meridians. 
[01:47:30]  Yeah, I go, what the fuck's going on?  She's going up doing some Reiki.  I'm like, fuck, I think I can do some Reiki.  New age shit.  Huh?  New age shit.  We can make a fortune by doing Reiki.  All you have to do is this.  This is what she was doing when I opened up my eyes and her eyes were closed.  That's ridiculous.  I'm holding my two hands all the way out with my fingers wide open.  Massage.  Over a fake body.  It's supposed to be a massage.  That's right.  A fat Reiki.  I was on a plane one time.  I think I was flying to California because it was a long flight and I was in the back, 
[01:48:00]  back last row of the plane.  Of course.  Because that's, you know, where the seat doesn't go back.  It doesn't.  No, it didn't go back.  How much did you save doing that?  How much did you save doing that?  It was the same as any other coach.  But the guy, there was nobody in the middle, but the guy, I was on the window and the guy  on the aisle was this Asian guy.  He was like a young guy and I mean, I didn't say anything to him, but I was playing Monopoly  on my iPad and he started asking me about it and then he said, hey, so can I give you  energy?  And I was like, oh, I don't know what I got myself into right now. 
[01:48:30]  Oh my God.  And I was, I actually.  White, slimy energy.  Yeah.  Did you say yes?  I said yes.  Oh God.  Good for Sam.  Yeah.  I said yes.  Because you're like, what the fuck is this about?  Let's find out.  You weren't thinking he was going to jerk you off or anything, right?  Never know.  It was a possibility, but I knew I still said yes.  Well, I wouldn't have let him jerk me off.  No.  You probably would have.  I might have.  He spit in his palm and said, can I give you energy?  But he started, he said, okay, just please shut your eyes. 
[01:49:00]  Oh my God.  What a gullible little shit.  I was like, uh.  You said yes though, right?  And so I said yes.  I shut my eyes.  Damn, I'm back in the story.  I shut my eyes, but I was peeking a little bit, because I was like, he's probably going  to take my shit.  He's probably going to take my iPad or something.  And go where?  Yeah, thank you, Jimmy.  You're on a plane.  You asshole.  And you're in the, he still has to get past you.  Because, no, I opened, he was on the aisle, but I opened my eyes and I'd be like, where's  my iPad?  He'd be like, I don't know.  Oh, right.  Sure. 
[01:49:30]  And I'd be like, fuck.  But.  He'll jump out with a parachute.  Yeah, like TB Cooper.  Why wouldn't you hold all your shit if you were closing your eyes for a stranger?  That'd be my first move.  I'd be holding my shit.  Looks suspicious.  Anywho, he put his hand up just like that, like right close to my forehead.  He didn't actually touch me.  I know.  They get real close though.  They get like an inch, I think.  Yeah.  But he did it for like five minutes straight and I just kind of peeked with one eye.  I think I ruined his whole shit because I peeked with one eye and I was like, am I still  doing this? 
[01:50:00]  And he was like, yeah, just a couple more minutes.  And I was like, okay.  And then he was like, okay.  After like eight minutes of doing this.  He was giving you energy?  And he goes, how do you feel?  And I just looked at him and I was like, a little better.  No, you didn't.  Did you feel better?  No.  You should have told him no.  Hold on.  I felt good that it was over.  I got to defend the Reiki people though.  Oh boy.  You fucking opened your eye.  Yeah.  Of course.  He was a weirdo.  So then of course you're not going to feel better.  You didn't accept that something could happen in that moment.  I knew something could happen. 
[01:50:30]  That's why I kept my eyes open.  Fair enough.  Reiki stinks.  Dummy.  Yeah.  Especially when a weirdo confronts you in the back aisle of a plane.  Ah, fucking beat it with that shit.  I'm working on your meridians.  You don't like when they work on the meridians?  No, because it's like, it's like, I've never felt anything from Reiki.  I'm a Reiki practitioner.  Are you?  I got a rod.  What do you think?  I, I had a, I had a lady that wanted me to see golden triangles once and she insisted.  She's like, okay. 
[01:51:00]  And I, I might get this wrong for the people that really know this shit, but she touched  like my forehead and then she touched right around where my shoulder is attached to my, uh, upper  torso.  And then on the other side, and she goes, okay, do you, do you see the golden triangle?  And I realized after about two minutes of saying, I kept saying, no, no, no.  She goes, all right, all right, relax.  Do you see the golden triangle?  I go, no, no.  Then I realized the best thing to do in that situation was to say yes. 
[01:51:30]  Yeah.  It was taking way too fucking long.  So then I go, oh yeah, I see.  She goes, oh, good, good, good.  Okay.  And then she made more triangles with my body parts.  That's a blonde pussy though.  The golden triangle.  And then I got through the golden triangle thing by lying and getting through it.  Cause then she went back to the rubbing part.  But I felt like a good person.  Cause the guy, he felt really good about himself, like that I'd actually gotten some energy.  So what you did was you, you, what you do is you perpetuated this idiocy and now he's  bothering other people.  That's fine.  Guy in the plane. 
[01:52:00]  Yeah, yeah.  Good job.  Did he at least blow you?  No, he didn't even offer.  Would you just turn around?  Sleeping on the plane.  Is it gay if you can't escape the situation?  No, it's rape.  That would be rape.  If you're on a coast to coast flight, is it gay?  Yeah, no, that's actually, that's rape.  Oh.  I would have said no.  You know if I have something, I think.  Does anyone know about this Reiki that wants to call up now because Jimmy says bullshit?  It's nonsense.  It's total bullshit. 
[01:52:30]  Your, your pal Damien Echols there, uh, believes in it.  Yeah, but Damien, it's in his book, right?  I give him the benefit of the doubt.  Damien, when you said he was, he was able to heal himself by using some of the Reiki techniques.  Maybe that's possible.  Yeah.  I had an ex that participated in Chundo Sun Bop, which sounds very similar to Reiki.  What?  You did what?  Chundo Sun Bop.  Chundo Sun Bop?  Yep.  What's Chundo Sun Bop?  I think.  Is that that Chumba Wumba band?  Nope.  Not an act at all.  Oh, that was that Hanson song.  No, no, no.  That's Mbop. 
[01:53:00]  Oh, oh.  Chundo Sun Bop is what?  It's, uh, it, it sounds like Reiki, except it's a Chundo Sun Bop.  It's like you, you.  Chinese restaurant.  You gather with a group of people.  Why did you do this?  She was doing it.  I didn't do it.  Who?  My ex.  The black one?  One of the black ones, yeah.  Chundo Sun Bop?  Okay.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Yeah.  The, oh, what?  I mean, I heard an N.  What?  Huh?  Anyway, um, yeah, it's like a whole group of people. 
[01:53:30]  Yeah.  And there's not, there's like a, one instructor at the front of the room, but they're not putting  their hand over you.  You have to open your hands and hold your palms out, because the palm is where the energy comes  from.  So where you demand the money from the guy at the counter?  That's why I couldn't participate in the classes, because they were talking about  how much they cost.  Shit.  But yeah, and that's supposed to like, uh, heal you.  It's shit, Sam.  It's shit.  It's total shit.  Massage is very healing, and I believe like good massage is good for you. 
[01:54:00]  I'm going to go with the other side of this.  I don't know if it's total shit.  Total shit.  I think there's some, uh, fakes out there.  If there's any way energy could come off your hands, you should be able to move shit when  you get real close to something.  Yeah.  Like powder?  Like powder, or fucking, uh, how about something metal?  If it's some kind of magnetic thing.  Like the movie.  Or just something.  Well, how about we get some Reiki people to maybe explain it further?  Exactly.  Or, uh, Deepak could.  Yeah, maybe he knows more about it. 
[01:54:30]  Maybe Deepak could Reiki Anthony.  I don't want to be Reikied.  There's no way.  No Reiki.  Oh, what is that shirt?  How about Shovel D?  Is it, uh, does Deepak believe in God?  I think he does, yeah.  I don't know.  I could be wrong.  Like a Buddha one, or what?  Maybe Buddha.  I'm not sure.  I'm not sure.  His son did a documentary on him.  His son, Gotham, it's called Decoding Deepak, and it's about just kind of getting to the  bottom.  Because you get the feeling like this guy lives with his dad, and people worship his father, 
[01:55:00]  like celebrities, and Deepak is a very, very well-respected.  He's written a hundred books, maybe.  I mean, he's a legitimately smart guy, and he's considered a healer, or kind of, you  know, or just a, whatever he's considered, but he's considered one of those kind of gurus,  like a real guru.  And his son, you can tell, is kind of like, eh, I don't know if that's the guy I know.  And he's just trying to...  Oh, really?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Like, you know, he points out flaws of his father's, too.  Interesting.  It was an interesting dynamic.  Wow. 
[01:55:30]  Why would he let his own son fuck up his legacy?  Well, I don't think he does.  He...  What does he have to gain from that?  That seems a little weird.  Well, the kid said that he was making a documentary different than his father thought he was making.  Oh.  And then his father allowed that?  He had no choice.  How about his father goes, how about you get your own fucking career going?  Seriously?  Well, he doesn't destroy him.  Oops.  The guy's coming in, right?  Well, that's a fair question, though.  That's a fair question.  Like, why didn't you say that?  Because I don't think he...  It's not like he's just showing him as he is.  Drinking his coffee and on his BlackBerry obsessively. 
[01:56:00]  BlackBerry, huh?  Yeah.  He's a BlackBerry guy.  Boy, he doesn't have knowledge.  There's somebody on the phone who does Reiki.  Where?  They're on the phone.  They're on line one.  All right, let's do it fast.  Yeah.  And then we've got to take a break before Deepak comes in here.  Reiki guy.  Hey, how you doing, guys?  I don't know your name.  That's the only reason I'm saying that.  Our phones are fucked up.  Where are you calling from?  John from Philly.  All right.  What do you know about Reiki?  I'll tell you right now.  As a matter of fact, I'll give you a perfect example.  I'm just about to utilize it.  I'm looking out my backyard, and there's leaves all over the place, and I'm going to use a Reiki. 
[01:56:30]  All right.  That's not the kind of Reiki they were talking about.  Why do we even attempt to have a real conversation on the show?  Yes, yes.  I don't know.  But that is funny.  Reiki.  That is real funny.  Oh, my God.  All right, we've got Deepak coming in next with his son, Gotham.  Yes.  That's right.  Gotham's a New York name.  I'm thinking of New York names.  It's a Batman name.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I like it. 
[01:57:00]  I think it's kind of a weird name, though.  Yeah, it's dope.  It's a dumb name.  Harlem's the name to go with.  Oh, okay.  Harlem.  What?  Harlem Hughes?  No.  Why is...  You call a kid Harlem?  Yeah, you do.  What are you, crazy?  No, you don't.  It's cool.  No, it's not.  It's cool.  It's very cool.  Harlem.  Why is Clinton growing her hair out?  It's getting creepy.  Sexy.  Yeah.  What's she going for, you think?  I don't know.  Sexing it up.  What is she trying to hide?  She's using a curling iron with it, too.  Why is she growing her hair out? 
[01:57:30]  She wants to be sexy for her man.  She's 65 years old.  Isn't that when you're supposed to start chopping it off?  Hmm.  You like her with the short hair or the long hair?  I don't.  Either way?  Yeah.  But you got to choose.  Hmm.  Which one you like best?  I don't.  You don't want to answer that one?  I can't.  She does zero for me.  Yeah.  With the hair, without the hair, fucking zero.  What about the daughter?  Not bad, right? 
[01:58:00]  Not bad at times.  She looks different every couple of years.  Not bad.  She's like a snake.  She sheds her skin and a whole new thing comes out.  Let's see.  What does she look like these days?  Oh, can I ask?  No, she's looking a lot like her mom these days.  I want to give my kid a pet.  Do I go bird, fish?  Alligator.  Turtle?  You don't go fucking bird.  Or hamster.  You want something that can shit on top of your dresser?  No, you don't.  More hamster.  Rack, rack, rack.  All right.  Rack, rack, rack, rack. 
[01:58:30]  Rack.  Rack, rack, rack, rack, rack.  Fucking white liquidy shit on the top of your cake box.  You're fucking on top of your fedoras.  Rack, rack.  Saying dumb things.  Rack, jewelry dish.  Rack, rack.  Ice box.  Rack, rack, rack.  Curtains, rack.  Fucking birds are douchebags.  No, get a quiet one.  So what do I do? 
[01:59:00]  Hamster?  Yeah, hamster.  A hamster.  Hamster's fine.  But I saw turtles, man.  They could rock around your living room for a while.  Oh, that's good.  Yeah, turtle.  Get him a hamster so you got to tell him and teach him about death really early on.  No, man.  Ah, you replaced that shit.  Yeah.  Yeah, that's what my brothers do.  Just throw in a new hamster.  They just replaced that shit.  What happened to his brother?  You just got to get up before the kid gets up.  Yeah.  That's all.  Yeah.  And then what you tell him, oh, he's sleeping.  What if the kid finds him?  Eh, you distract him.  So you got to work as a team.  I woke him up. 
[01:59:30]  The mom distracts.  The father goes, gets another one, does the old switcheroo.  You say he's dead because he didn't do his homework.  You say he died.  He wouldn't eat his veggies, and this is what happens.  Hey.  Yeah, use it to your advantage.  Anything worse than finding your pet's dead?  Ugh.  What the fuck?  Oh, man.  Yeah, that was pretty fucking sad growing up.  I remember one time asking where one of our dogs was, and my dad's like,  Oh, we should break real quick. 
[02:00:00]  Take a breaky.  The Chopras are next.  Three seconds.  The Opinetry Show.  Got a very spiritual guy coming into the studio, Deepak Chopra.  And Gotham, I know Gotham.  What's up, Gotham?  How are you?  Good, how are you?  We're on.  I have no idea who you are.  Yeah, we're on the air.  Hey, Deepak, how are you, sir? 
[02:00:30]  Good to see you.  There's the man.  There's the man.  And your son, Gotham.  The man.  We met in an elevator once.  I know.  You do?  Of course.  You do know.  Yes.  You remember stuff.  I'm a former employee.  Yeah, but I asked for some spirituality, and he gave me nothing.  Why wouldn't you give me anything?  Because you're stuck in the first chakra.  Oh, yeah, see?  Uh-oh, what's that?  First chakra.  Is that bad?  You know what that is?  I meditate now, though, sir.  I'm good.  Okay, kidding.  Do you?  Yeah, I meditate.  How's that work out for you? 
[02:01:00]  Pretty good.  All right.  I'm not as irritable.  Yeah.  Do you believe in Reiki?  We were talking about Reiki, and I've gotten a lot of massage.  I mean a lot of massage.  And not always the most legitimate, but I've tried Reiki, and it just didn't do anything  for me.  I have problems with energy work, like believing that it works.  Well, right now, as you're speaking, we are transmitting this information through energy.  There's nothing but energy in the universe.  I think you should focus a little more. 
[02:01:30]  You're probably distracted.  But you're too used to the massage.  The illegitimate.  Yeah, the illegitimate.  But can you break it down and explain Reiki?  Because you don't touch the body.  That's why people are confused by that.  Okay.  I mean, just take your left hand right now.  Okay.  Open your left hand like this.  Point your finger to your left hand.  And just have the idea that you're directing some energy.  Can you feel a hot spot?  I actually can.  There you are.  Do you feel that? 
[02:02:00]  Yeah.  You can feel something when it gets really close.  What does that do?  No, no.  You can do that from a distance.  All you have to do is have the intention for healing, and that's it.  You're directing the electromagnetic energy of your body, and you're focusing it for healing.  But your heart, you know, when you do an EKG, what are you measuring?  The energy of the heart.  When you do brain waves, what are you measuring?  So every living organism, every living organism radiates photons or electromagnetic energy.  And you can direct that and focus that for any purpose. 
[02:02:30]  Now, your son did a documentary on you, which I saw, and it was very interesting, the dynamic between you two guys.  He said he did it on me.  It was about him, though.  Yeah, it was about him a little bit, but it was also about people's perception of you.  Yes.  And because, you know, you're a very spiritual guy, and people have a real idolize you, and a lot of people really look up to you.  And, Gotham, how is it kind of living in that environment, and what did you want the documentary to accomplish? 
[02:03:00]  Well, clearly, I don't necessarily idolize him, if you've seen.  No, I mean, why don't you idolize your father?  I mean, I do.  I have a deep respect.  I mean, my dad didn't do shit with his life, but I idolize him.  I really do.  I came out the other side, actually, with a deeper respect for my father and what he has contributed to the world and what people get back from him.  But, you know, I started it because I was always sort of conflicted with the way people have seen my father and think of him versus who I thought he was. 
[02:03:30]  And that's not to say my version is more true, but it was definitely very different.  Well, you get to see things that we don't, obviously.  Of course.  I mean, you know, and that's the thing.  Once you get sort of beyond the celebrity part of it, it's kind of a movie about fathers and sons and families and relationships and, you know, how those evolve.  What was the biggest misconception that you thought people had of your dad or the biggest flawed view they had? 
[02:04:00]  That he is somehow sort of not human, that he is the super spiritual guy that doesn't have, you know, sort of normal contradictions and addictions.  And when I say addictions, I mean, you know, coffee, his blackberry, you know, not exactly these harmful ones, although he does have that in his past.  And I think that was sort of revealing to people.  And he talks quite openly about it also, you know, he's battled addictions in his past, overcome them. 
[02:04:30]  So I think, you know, what my dad is, he's a pretty grounded guy and he's actually pretty relatable.  And that in some ways makes his spiritual message more powerful.  How did you overcome your addictions?  Because there's a lot of people listening to our show that are going through that.  What worked for you?  For me, the only thing that worked is substitute.  So for me, it was beginning with meditation.  And I'm now addicted to meditation, you know, so you substitute a higher addiction for a lower one or earlier one. 
[02:05:00]  But lots of people find substitutes, exercise.  Yes, the great spiritual leader, Mrs. Norton, said the same thing to her son, James.  Yes.  That's substituting certain things.  But, you know, addiction is a search for joy, actually.  Sure.  When people start any addictive behavior, it's a search for pleasure and joy.  So ultimately, it's a spirit.  That's what spirituality also is. 
[02:05:30]  It's a search for joy.  So I like to say I went from spirits to spirit.  Right.  Oh.  So you, what was, was there anything you were, I'm sorry, was there anything you were.  That's trademarked.  That's hilarious.  Oh, my God.  Now, this is what I got to deal with.  This is my son in a bunch of years, huh?  Were you surprised at how Gotham, his perception of you, was there anything that surprised you?  I didn't get to see the movie until he had done the final edit. 
[02:06:00]  Oh.  And he had already decided it was going to go to the film festivals.  After picture lock, he showed you, pretty much.  So he sent it to me.  I actually delivered it.  And I didn't watch it for a couple of days.  Because I never watch anything that's about me.  Never.  It's just a habit.  But then he kept asking me, have you seen it?  So I said, okay, I'll see it.  And then when I started to look at it, I looked at the whole thing because it was quite intriguing,  very interesting, and also showed me that, you know, there's so many different me's. 
[02:06:30]  One, how I think of myself.  Two, how my family thinks of me.  Third, how the public thinks of me.  And then there's probably a real me that's beyond all of this.  Right.  Somewhere in the mix there.  Can I ask about meditation?  I recently started meditating.  I don't know what's going on.  But I'm fascinated by it.  Right.  Like, what am I trying to do when my eyes are closed and I'm breathing?  I'm able to stay in the meditated state, by the way. 
[02:07:00]  Right, yeah.  Well, what you're doing is first you're quietening your mind.  And then ultimately, there'll come a stage where you go beyond the mind into what we call, you know, for lack of a better word, the soul.  The soul is your core consciousness from where your thoughts come.  It's where your memories are, where your desires are.  And in Eastern wisdom traditions, we say it's the karma, the software of the soul is karma, memory, and desire, and recycles through cosmic time as life. 
[02:07:30]  Right.  So you're getting in touch with a very fundamental part of yourself, and if you keep up with it, you'll find more creativity, more insight, and all the things that great spiritual traditions talk about.  I've been disappointed with organized religion for a really long time, brought up Catholic, and this is talking to me.  Yeah.  There is an absolute spirituality to it, but it seems like it breaks down religion to a very basic level. 
[02:08:00]  Yeah, well, religion is, originally, religion is about this experience.  It's overcoming fear, it's love, compassion, joy, equanimity, creativity, insight, inspiration, all those things.  But, you know, Catholicism somehow institutionalized guilt as an institution.  It's an institution built to guilt.  You're a sinner to begin with.  So, you know, a lot of people don't feel their sinners, you know, we have addictions, that's fine. 
[02:08:30]  Do you follow an actual religion?  No, I don't.  Okay.  Also, by the way, I've written a book called God, and this came out today, and it's the history of religion from the time of the Old Testament to right to modern times.  Right.  Where the book ends with Einstein, you know, who was a deeply spiritual person.  So it tracks the history of theological thought. 
[02:09:00]  I'll send it to you.  I'll make sure you get it today.  Can I, now, what do you think happens when you die?  I've read your thoughts over the years about that.  Yeah.  Well, there's a part of you, by the way, that is not in space or time.  So your mind is in space and time.  Right now, the thoughts you have are in this location, in space, and this moment in time.  But there's a part of you that's not in space and time.  And in spiritual traditions, they call it the soul.  That's what recycles as this body and this mind. 
[02:09:30]  Right.  Everything in the universe recycles, even plastic.  But we're not going to know we're recycling.  Well, you have your memories that, from the past, are the basis of your personality.  If you have two identical twins, any mother will tell you that they're different personalities,  even at the moment of birth.  Right.  They have the same DNA, though.  Right.  Was there anything in the documentary?  Because I was, again, I was very interested to see how, again, like I said, like your son saw you. 
[02:10:00]  And it wasn't bad.  It was just like a son sees his father.  Was there anything that disappointed you when you saw it?  No, it didn't.  It actually was very honest and very straightforward.  There's a moment in the documentary where he and I go to a place in the Himalayas where we look at the records of our ancestors.  So you see, you know, the signatures and the writings of mine, letters addressed to him before he was there. 
[02:10:30]  Wow.  And then my fathers and their grandfathers and their grandparents.  So first it's in English, then it's in Urdu, which is a mixture of Persian and Hindi, and then it goes on and on.  And the records go back approximately 2,000 years.  Wow.  That was a very pivotal moment for him because, you know, when you're young, you don't think about your mortality.  Must be nice.  Did you have an experience like that with your dad?  It's a sober moment.  No.  My dad took me to the Catskills once. 
[02:11:00]  Oh, yeah?  I went to Turtleback Zoo when I was a boy.  I mean, look at the experience these two are having.  That was one of the best moments in the documentary.  Right.  It's when they go and they find, they literally, it's like in these, this little teeny narrow lane.  Yeah.  And they find this, I don't want to say it's a shop, but it's like this book of handwritten things that is generations, centuries.  Yeah, it was really, really interesting.  And it also, I mean, it just opens up the larger context of who you are because you realize you are the product of this, you know, endless ancestry. 
[02:11:30]  Wow.  I'm ending it.  If one of those guys, you know, and there are millions of them, if they weren't in the mood, we wouldn't be here.  I know.  One of them had to be missing, right?  Just one, right?  Yeah.  Well, can you imagine many people that aren't here because it didn't work out.  Yeah, but the fact.  All those possibilities of people that aren't here.  Yeah, yeah, but we are here.  Yeah, yeah.  Which is, you know, a total surprise.  It should be.  Yeah.  That's a spiritual experience, to be perpetually surprised that you exist. 
[02:12:00]  Should we be scared of death?  I'm not.  I mean.  Why aren't you, though?  Because I'm in touch with that part of me that's not subject to birth and death.  You don't get nervous.  You said you had to spend, you were doing a CNN interview in the documentary, and I guess you were just kind of putting in the headset.  And somebody asked me, like, are you nervous?  You're like, no, I haven't been nervous in 15 years or whatever.  You just.  14.  Oh, is it 14?  But by this point, it's 15.  We've been picking over a year. 
[02:12:30]  But that was because of a girl.  Oh, so you don't get scared of public speaking or any of that stuff?  No, no, no, never.  Wow.  When you give a speech, and you give a lot of them, do you ever feel like, okay, this one is going really well, or this one is not going as well as I want it to?  No, I intuitively feel the audience, and then I respond to what I think they would like to know.  Is your son, are you as spiritual as your dad, Gotham?  No.  No, I mean, I think it depends on how you define spirituality. 
[02:13:00]  I have been meditating since I was probably five years old, but for me, the sort of spiritual experience is replicated.  Like when I go for a run in the park, I mean, you have the same experience to some extent that you have meditating.  But I also, you know, struggle with a lot of things.  I look at what's going on in the world, and, you know, it's decidedly not spiritual.  So, and that's partly what the movie is about, this world that my father represents and that I've grown up in, and how does it really connect to what's going on in the world? 
[02:13:30]  And for me, it doesn't always.  Right.  And that's, you know, hard.  Deepak, do you get so frustrated that you work so hard at this and there's so much hate in this world?  That is a frustration for sure.  You know, I mean, just imagine that little video that was put out a few weeks ago.  It caused more damage than 150,000 Iraqis dying in the war, more damage than all the drone killing. 
[02:14:00]  So you realize that people are more conflicted with or upset or going to rage with things like humiliation and lack of respect.  So I thought if we can create such a, such rage in the world with a video, why can't we actually create love and compassion and joy with another video?  In fact, that's what I'm thinking.  You know, get the best talent in the world and make a five-minute video for YouTube that inspires people to respect each other. 
[02:14:30]  That's all that's needed, you know.  Now, there's Gallup data that shows that the best way to get rid of your enemy is to increase their capacity for well-being or happiness.  The happiness of your enemies is important to your well-being.  That's a good point.  But I'll say one thing, too.  Here's a reason that it's harder to make a video like you're talking about than the other one.  Because people a lot of times want, I think, an excuse to be angry or they just look for something to set them off.  It's almost like when a guy hits his wife, it's not because she did something wrong. 
[02:15:00]  It's because of who he is and she gave him that excuse.  People very rarely feel like they need an excuse to behave nicely.  It's true.  People are at different stages of development.  There's people in our world right now who are in a stage of development that would have been normal in the 10th century.  So they're stuck in the 10th century.  There are other people who are stuck in the Middle Ages.  There are other people who are stuck in the Industrial Age of, say, Charles Dickens.  And then there are people who are progressives and going beyond that. 
[02:15:30]  So it's a tough thing.  There's some work that's done on this.  It's called Spiral Dynamics that you can actually never change another person unless you get to their level and address their perspective with respect, no matter what the level is.  So when you're saying, like, when you, and when I look at, like, say, Islam, which is, I guess, the big violent thing going right now, I look at them as kind of like, well, they're a newer religion than Christianity. 
[02:16:00]  So I see they deal with things the way Christians did in the 15th century or during the Inquisition.  And Christians were barbaric.  I mean, it wasn't like Christianity had a wonderful, you know, peaceful.  They would saw people in half upside down.  So it's like, I guess you have to, you know, Islam has a very feminine side and a very beautiful side.  It's called Sufism, which is actually all about love and all about devotion and all about respect and all about joy.  Why doesn't the average, I apologize for interrupting you, but it's got to be asked. 
[02:16:30]  Why doesn't the average person know that?  Most people are like, oh, they're barbaric.  Yeah, because actually, even some of the Islamists don't respect Sufism as their own.  You know, what happened historically, it seems, I mean, this is the explanation offered by some people,  is that when the printing press was invented for 250 to 300 years, Islam did not embrace it,  which means that they did not allow their books to be printed. 
[02:17:00]  So the rest of the world was printing, and knowledge was becoming available to the common person,  whereas the mullahs held on to their Quran without allowing it to be published.  At least this is the interpretation I received from Al Gore of all the people who said,  that's why some parts of the world got left behind.  Bad PR.  Bad PR.  Are you impressed?  Must work for this place.  Are you impressed with anybody you meet? 
[02:17:30]  Because it's funny to watch the way celebrities act around you.  And I'm not saying you're not deserving of their respect, because they obviously like your message.  But, I mean, Michael Jackson, Lady Gaga, these are the biggest celebrities in the world.  They all kind of look to you to, I guess, do something for them spiritually.  Yeah, I've met people like Nelson Mandela, who will blow your mind with their presence and their inspiration and their spirit and their persona. 
[02:18:00]  You know, I went to this place, Robben Island, where Nelson Mandela was in a little room, dark room, with no windows, no light for over 20 years.  And when he came out of it, he was not resentful at all.  In fact, when he was asked, aren't you resentful?  He said, having a resentment is like drinking poison and hoping it'll kill your enemy.  And when he got elected as the first president after apartheid, he chose white people who were oppressors as part of his cabinet. 
[02:18:30]  You know, it's an extraordinary human being.  And then as soon as he, you know, thought he had done his work, he resigned and didn't even want to be president.  So that's a very inspiring person.  Sure.  Mother Teresa was like that, too.  You met her?  Yeah, I met her once.  Did she ever have fun?  Huh?  Yeah.  Did she ever have fun?  I forgot to ask her, actually.  I mean, wow.  I never asked her that.  Isn't there, there's almost, though, like, I think my favorite thing about this documentary was that you painted your dad as, obviously, your work ethic is amazing, 
[02:19:00]  which I think the thing I liked about you the most is the fact that you have all this fame and success and there's nothing lazy about you.  But you're a flawed.  You're not a perfect person.  And I like that.  Well, that's exactly what he's saying.  Did you have fun?  I mean, you know, if you don't have any flaws, then how can you have fun?  Right.  But isn't there something almost odd about a person, Mother Teresa or somebody who, I watched a documentary on a nun who gave up acting to go into the nunnery. 
[02:19:30]  And there just seems something flawed in giving up everything to just serve one purpose.  Maybe I just don't have that column.  Well, you see, there are some people who suppress that, and that can break out into pathology as all the, you see, the pedophilia in the Catholic Church.  Sure.  That's suppression, right?  Right.  An institution that condemns gays as sinners and then hides pedophiles in its own clergy. 
[02:20:00]  That's definitely flawed.  On the other hand, there are people who transcend that.  They go beyond that.  There are other people who say, I've been there, done that.  You know, so you can't make a single statement about everyone.  And do you, when you, do you see, when you see people reacting to your father, do you, do you ever kind of secretly enjoy it or want to say to them, like, what did you, what?  He's just like, he's a guy.  He's not, do you ever watch them overreacting?  Yeah, but I think, you know, I've noticed over the years, people see in my father what they want to see in him. 
[02:20:30]  You know, it's, so, as he said, you know, the movie's really about me.  It's, it's true.  And I realized that.  But I also realized, you know, the movie's largely about what people need out of him.  And he's largely the product of the times that we live in, all the things we're talking about, what's going on in the world, and your desire to move away from religion, but have a spiritual practice.  I mean, that's, it's a huge trend in the world today.  And he's kind of this symbol, this person who's able to articulate that. 
[02:21:00]  So, you know, and that's the history of spiritual teachers.  They're a looking glass.  You look into it and you find what it is that you need from them at that moment.  So I, I'm humored by it sometimes.  And there's some clips of that in the movie.  But, you know, I, I try not to judge.  I don't always do it.  Well, and he makes a lot of money.  Well, it's put me through college.  But, you know, you'd be surprised.  Not as much, you know, not as much money necessarily as people.  People think there's this huge empire. 
[02:21:30]  Yeah.  There's not.  You know, we walked here.  Also, we have a foundation.  We do a lot of work.  We send 1.5 million children to school in India.  And they get a meal every day.  We work here in the inner city.  We have a program called Urban Yoga.  We teach people something called Hip Hop Yoga.  50 Cent is a champion of that project.  So we have lots of good stuff going on.  Nice.  No, I know you do.  We have to make some jokes here.  A few.  There was, oh, we ask a lot of people this. 
[02:22:00]  We're not alone in the universe, are we?  It's very unlikely that we are.  Very unlikely.  Very unlikely.  Because, you know, there are 100 billion stars in our own galaxy.  So there are trillions of planets.  And then right next door is something called Andromeda, which has the same amount of stars.  And then next door to that is Virgo.  So there are over a billion galaxies that extend all the way to the cosmic horizon, which is 47 billion light years away.  So if there was no one else in the universe, that would be a capricious anomaly. 
[02:22:30]  Yeah.  And it also seems like we kind of picked a shitty suburban location outside of the Milky Way.  The junkyard of infinity.  Yeah, and you could follow in your dad's footsteps and have this presence, at least in the minds of other people, that your dad does.  And you've kind of chosen not to, which I respect a lot, because it would be a very safe decision to follow in the footsteps of somebody who is so respected and be that person. 
[02:23:00]  It would be inauthentic, first of all, for me personally.  You know, I think people have that expectation a lot, but that's not who I am.  I mean, I'm curious.  I consider myself a spiritual person, but my version of spirituality, I'm greatly troubled by the replacement officials, for example, in the NFL.  And I'm not sure how spiritual that is.  But, you know, I am fortunate to also live in a time where it's cool to be a content creator because you can create content and get it out by any means necessary. 
[02:23:30]  And so I'm having fun.  And that's the one thing I've learned from my father.  If you're not having fun doing what you're doing, it's not worth doing it.  Yeah, I actually have three criteria.  Is it fun?  Are you doing it with people that are fun to be with?  And number three is making a difference.  Oh, boy.  That's it.  This show is over.  Yeah, exactly.  How about if we've done none of those three?  This show is over.  Do you guys argue a lot or did you argue a lot coming up?  And if so, were you ever able to win any of the arguments? 
[02:24:00]  Because you're a great talker.  We do.  I don't know how much.  Well, my sister says we bicker a lot.  I think I do try to challenge my father.  It's a lot in the movie, definitely.  I try to ground him in a lot of what he's talking about.  I don't know.  I think I chalk up a few points here and there.  We have a YouTube channel, The Chopra Well, where you'll see a lot of our conversations.  And it's a great channel because it's got comedy, too, in it. 
[02:24:30]  And it's got elements that you wouldn't normally relate to just me because it's a family channel.  It's got him.  It's got my daughter.  It's got other people.  So what was your bottom when you got into meditation from drinking or whatever?  Was it just alcohol or was it other stuff, too?  Cigarettes and alcohol.  Okay, yeah.  Cigarettes, I think, I quit everything, too.  Cigarettes was the hardest.  What was your bottom with alcohol where you said it's time to stop? 
[02:25:00]  Actually, it was very interesting.  I was training as an internist and I'd already finished my training and I was a medical doctor.  And then one day we came out of having resuscitated a patient in the ICU and intubated him, put him on a ventilator, and came out and had a cigarette.  And I said, what am I doing?  I thought it was a very kind of pivotal moment.  And then, you know, seeing my patients dying of all the things that I was doing myself, those were the moments. 
[02:25:30]  I mean, I started to question.  One day I said, okay, done.  And that's when you stopped drinking and that's when you stopped?  Yeah, and then I took on meditation as well.  What was the first step towards being, like, publicly a figure for being this guy who did this and quit these things to all of a sudden, like, wow, people are listening to what I'm saying.  Like, I have an ability to move people by what I'm saying.  In the beginning, it was just books.  And then later, you know, it was public appearances.  And then in 1993, I did the Oprah Winfrey show. 
[02:26:00]  And we sold, like, 800,000 copies of my book in one week.  Boy, she could sell books.  Oh, Oprah.  I've never wanted anyone to like me so much in my life as Oprah.  You know, no matter where I went, people were, I called Oprah.  I said, if you were married to me, you'd be Oprah Chopra.  I did enjoy that joke. 
[02:26:30]  You're not the first ones to have that joke cracked on you.  I'm sure.  Was that his go-to material?  Gotham's rolling his eyes.  That line again.  Do you like the fact that you've raised a son who challenges sometimes what you think and is obviously a very free thinker?  He's got his own brand of spirituality, and that's, you know, to be spiritual is to be real.  Right.  You know, as long as you're not putting on a social mask, you're a spiritual person.  So you like the fact that you're pretty much a free thinker as opposed to somebody who's just going to parrot what you say. 
[02:27:00]  I am neutral to it.  Neutral?  Mm-hmm.  Yeah.  What do you think that means?  What every son wants to hear.  Your father's neutral towards you.  I appreciate it.  Like, I mean, I'm very, first of all, as much as I'm sarcastic about everything, I'm very grateful.  And I realize, you know, the privilege I've had is because of also, you know, how hard my father's worked and what he's achieved.  And he's, by the way, he's very modest.  I mean, he's the classic immigrant story.  He came to this country in the early 70s with no money in his wallet, and he made this life. 
[02:27:30]  And I'm benefiting from it.  My five-year-old son's benefiting from it.  So I'm very cognizant of all that.  But I also, you know, in some ways, the best way to honor that is, yeah, to do my own thing.  How old were you when you came to America?  I was 23.  20?  And no money?  $4.  And that I spent.  So, all right, you got.  Oh, he said no money.  But I love breaking this down.  So you got the $4. 
[02:28:00]  You're an American.  Well, by the way, you should hear he had $100.  He spent $96.  Where?  At the Moulin Rouge in Paris en route.  Ah, there you go.  Last little blast.  So you got $4.  Now what do you do?  What do you do with the $4?  I made a collect call because I was going to report as an intern to a hospital in Plainfield, New Jersey.  And by the time I got through, my $4 ran out.  So then somebody told me you can make a collect call.  So I made a collect call to the hospital administrator. 
[02:28:30]  There was a big shortage of doctors because they were all in Vietnam.  The Vietnam War was coming to an end.  So they needed doctors.  I had just finished medical training.  I wasn't really a full-fledged doctor, but I had finished medical training.  And they sent me a helicopter to pick me up from JFK.  So my first experience was looking out of the window at the Manhattan skyline and saying,  my God, this is Disney World.  This is amazing. 
[02:29:00]  And, you know, 20 minutes later, I was in this little emergency room in Plainfield, New Jersey,  looking after people with gunshot wounds.  I'd never seen a patient in my life, but I adapted.  And for eight hours, I was like a surgeon.  You know, that's what happens when you're put thrust into a situation.  Wow.  So there was a little luck there, obviously, because of circumstances.  Yeah.  Oh, of course.  You know, the whole thing about Vietnam, the shortage of doctors, the way, you know, being sought out and trained. 
[02:29:30]  In one year, I was in Boston.  Harvard.  So it was an amazing thing.  That happens to everyone, right?  Oh, yeah.  Just like that.  I just want to know why the trip over here always costs exactly how much money you have.  I know.  Everybody's here.  I came here with no money.  It's like, wow, that trip just costs always exactly what you had in your pocket.  Because they took whatever you had.  You know that.  They took advantage of them.  That's called the story of strippers.  As you know. 
[02:30:00]  Yeah, the Moulin Rouge.  You got to.  You got to.  You got another one.  American Dream.  Oh, my.  See how much he has in his pockets.  You have to say au revoir.  Yeah.  Do you.  It's funny when you said, Gotham, when you just said like, you know, you're joking.  You say everything a guy wants to hear from his dad.  But do you think that like when he said I'm neutral to it, do you think that that means  your dad is neutral to it or that he kind of wishes you followed a little closer in his  footsteps but accepts that you haven't?  No, no.  Let me explain that.  I'm just curious how he takes that. 
[02:30:30]  I know.  I take it as, again, my dad doesn't actually judge me for better or for worse.  And that is a luxury.  You know, I think, yeah, there's moments probably where I resisted that.  I wanted him to care more, but I've, you know, matured beyond that.  And now I actually look at it as what an amazing privilege to not have expectations that you  have to meet just to gain affection.  You know, my father accepts me, accepts my sister, accepts my mother the way we are. 
[02:31:00]  You know, he doesn't sort of force us to be the way he wants us to be.  Where's your mom's spirituality at?  Well, first of all, we always joke that, you know, he talks, she walks.  I mean, she is the living embodiment of everything that he talks about.  You know, she's amazing and, you know, has sort of been the spine for everything he's done.  But also, you know, the reason I'm here right now is my mom's taking care of my five-year-old  son while my wife works.  So she's given us, you know, the ability to do all these things. 
[02:31:30]  Do you think it would have been easier for you if you had just kind of really closely  followed in your dad's footsteps?  Because he has such a built-in following of people that they probably would have embraced  you immediately.  I may have been easier.  It certainly wouldn't have been as real or as much fun as I'm having now.  But sometimes you just got to go into the family business.  Yeah.  That's a good family business.  Yeah.  Oh, my God.  Yeah.  I think I would.  It wouldn't be authentic. 
[02:32:00]  Yeah.  I would certainly be happy to do that.  Right.  If it would work.  Wow.  Do you get frustrated with people at all or do you kind of let it roll off your back?  I have gotten used to let it roll off my back.  Yeah.  But you would.  It took a little work.  It did.  Yeah.  But I'm fine.  There was something that upset you in the documentary, too.  There was something somebody asked you was during an interview or something that made  you.  Do you remember what I'm talking about?  I don't remember.  Yeah.  What was it?  Fox News.  Oh, it's Fox.  OK.  What exactly was it that bothered you that happened? 
[02:32:30]  Well, what happened, it goes back a while.  You know, when the Islamists attacked Bombay, the Pakistani terrorists, it was in the news.  I was on Larry King.  And I said, we've got to be very careful that we don't inflame this situation further by condemning  all of Islam.  You know, I said that on Larry King.  And I was particularly actually pointing out to India, because India has a relationship  with Pakistan that's always inflammatory. 
[02:33:00]  You know, and it goes, it's historical.  It's like the Arabs and the Israelis.  So I was actually saying to my fellow Indians, you know, be careful, you'll get this, you'll  inflame this even more.  Right.  I said that on Larry King.  The next day, the Wall Street Journal printed a headline saying Deepak blames the U.S. for  terrorist attacks in Bombay.  And then, of course, Bill O'Reilly and Sean Hannity started repeating that. 
[02:33:30]  I was on their show.  We had some arguments.  Actually, I had Bill Cohen, this secretary, defense secretary of the United States on my  side on the show.  But they kind of edited that out and they kept repeating that.  So I did get aggravated.  And then I went to Times Square and got a picture, a photograph with those people who  dress up like the Statue of Liberty.  And I sent it to them and I said, I'm more patriotic than you are.  That's the genesis of that. 
[02:34:00]  Okay.  Well, they're telling us in our ears that Gotham and Deepak have to wrap up for other  press.  But I guess we should promote the documentary, which I really enjoyed.  And it was not what I thought it was going to be.  And I like you for showing what you showed.  And I also like you, Deepak, even more because you seem like a regular guy who just has this  ability.  And that, to me, was much more realistic.  Thank you.  Than just somebody who never makes mistakes.  Can you mention the book is out today?  The book is called God.  It's a story of revelation. 
[02:34:30]  I mean, we don't really need to plug it.  I'm sure it will be a bestseller.  I want a copy.  For real, I want a copy.  You'll get it today.  Deepak.  And it's called Decoding Deepak.  It's in theaters and it's on demand October the 5th.  And you can follow Deepak Chopra and Gotham Chopra both by their names on Twitter.  It's also in theaters, by the way.  Yeah, I said in theaters and on demand.  It's in one.  Is it a limited release or is it a national release?  It's starting out in 10 cities and we'll see where it goes.  But yeah, via Snag Films, you can find it online, download it. 
[02:35:00]  If you ever check Twitter or something, you'll get locations.  But I definitely recommend it.  It's a very, very interesting documentary.  Thank you.  I like this, man.  This was great.  Nice meeting you, God.  Thank you.  Thanks so much.  Good seeing you again, sir.  Get me your mailing address.  Oh, I will, sir.  Let's meditate together.  This was fun.  Thanks, guys.  I like Deepak. 
[02:35:30]  Yes.  Liked him.  I enjoy both of those guys.  I like his son, too, because he's not just an imprint of his dad.  He's different.  Absolutely.  So let's bring Bob in, I guess.  Mr. Bob Gullib, who I love.  Why are you laughing?  What's up with this guy?  Honestly, nothing.  He's just a funny dude. 
[02:36:00]  Yeah, of course.  Bring him in.  He's a...  Which guy was he out there?  That's rolling.  He's just the guy.  He just looks like a man.  Hey, how you doing, man?  Hey, what's up, guys?  Hey, Bob.  How are you, brother?  Take a seat.  Make yourself at home.  All right.  Thank you.  Norton's a big fan.  Oh, that's nice.  And we're meeting you for the first time.  I want families.  That's good.  Yeah.  Steelers fan, are you?  Diehard.  Diehard.  It's in blood.  Oh, yeah, huh?  It's religion, baby.  I heard Ronnie B talking about the Steelers yesterday, and he's like, you know, just because 
[02:36:30]  the uniforms look like they used to, it doesn't mean it's the Steelers team.  Like, not the...  Who's that?  I like the Steelers team of old.  Ron Bennington.  He does the show after us.  I know who he is.  Yeah, he's...  Have him talk to me about that show.  Oh, yeah, huh?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Because there's still the Steelers.  There's still the Steelers.  Yeah, the Steelers, as they would say, where I grew up.  The Steelers?  Yeah.  The Steelers.  The Steelers.  That's what I got.  Really?  Yeah, Steelers, right up the room, downtown.  That's how they talk in western Pennsylvania.  Oh, yeah?  Is that where you're from?  Yeah, I'm from actually Sharon, Pennsylvania, right on the border of Pennsylvania, Ohio, 
[02:37:00]  by Youngstown.  Wow, what's there to do out there, huh?  Nothing.  Not shit, man.  But Youngstown, you know about Youngstown at all or no?  Not really.  I like the song by Springsteen.  That's my favorite Springsteen song, Youngstown.  Yeah, I love it.  And I'm not a fan of Springsteen.  What's up with Youngstown?  Youngstown is like...  Let me explain something to you seriously, okay?  I like the name of it, though.  Youngstown is the toughest town in the fucking country, straight out. 
[02:37:30]  I mean, they think like Brooklyn, fuck you.  Youngstown, straight out, is the toughest town.  How about the Bronx?  How about Compton?  You could bring the Bronx.  You could bring them all.  Really?  First of all, all the world champions that come out of there, like I fought out of there,  Boom Boom Mancini, and I could go down a list of all the fighters that come out of  there that are world champions.  It's just blue color.  You fight, you fuck, and you drink.  And you drink.  That's what you do.  At the same time.  At the same time.  But you're kind of multitasking. 
[02:38:00]  But you kind of...  I'm not going to let you off the hook, because you just described a lot of towns.  But what makes Youngstown even more special than that?  Because, you know, I mean, it's like...  Okay, there's this...  You know, how people grew up...  Like, I'm Polish, okay?  So a lot of people grew up where you couldn't show love.  If you told your father you love, you had a sign of weakness.  You didn't do that.  Oh, yeah.  So, you know, it was a sign...  You're a faggot.  Yeah, right, right, right.  You got to rap to the head.  Right.  So Youngstown is... 
[02:38:30]  It just had...  Well, first of all, mob.  Yeah, the mob...  You got more mob than anywhere in the country per capita.  I mean, there's more car bombings in the 60s than anywhere.  They run the town.  So not now.  It's mostly black now, but, you know, because...  So it's gotten better?  It's gotten better.  But, no, I'm surprised you guys haven't heard of Youngstown.  I've heard of it.  No, we've heard about Youngstown.  I don't know much about it.  I've never talked to someone from there.  You know where a lot of champions have come out of, too, to talk about... 
[02:39:00]  If Philly has some tough people...  Motherfucking Philly!  Even though there's probably a section of Philly that's not nearly as tough,  which would balance that out, but they put out a lot of fun.  Yes, Philly!  They've probably got two million people.  Youngstown has, like, 400,000.  I mean, you know, a million...  I mean, the actual town is only about 300,000.  But Ernie Shavers came out of there.  He was a tough fighter.  Huh?  Ernie Shavers was a tough fighter.  I think Ali said he was the hardest-hitting guy he ever fought.  Ernie Shavers.  Yeah, yeah.  I mean, when he fought Larry Holmes, I don't know if you remember this,  Larry Holmes was kicking his ass. 
[02:39:30]  He was just waiting for that one big fight, one punch.  He hits him in the head, knocks him in the corner,  and he would have knocked him out, but he swung, like, far out as opposed to close up,  and then Holmes just covered up, and he would have beat him.  No one wanted to fight him, because it wasn't a money fight.  What if I can fight Larry Holmes?  I mean, I'm sorry, Shavers?  Why are you going to fight Shavers?  Right.  There's no money for it.  But Ali would fight everybody.  He did.  What's this fucking guy do?  He makes a half a million dollars fighting Ali.  He goes out, gets himself a white chick, leaves his fucking wife, 
[02:40:00]  buys a half a million...  What a shrew.  Goes out, fucking...  Unbelievable.  Bites a half a million dollar house.  He gets a half a fucking million dollars.  Bites a half a million dollars.  He gets rid of his wife, gets some fucking blonde white chick,  and I'm like, are you serious?  Now he's...  I don't know what he's doing now.  I think he's cleaning up shit in Youngstown.  That's...  Well, you know, there are certain stereotypes.  And the Youngstown people are checking in.  Every local congressman and senator from the area was protected. 
[02:40:30]  Some of the most illegal activities ever by elected officials.  Oh, yeah.  Well, you know who Jim Traficant is?  No.  Who's that?  Oh, Jim Traficant is from Youngstown.  He's unbelievable.  Oh, James Traficanty?  Yeah.  Yeah.  He has the worst wig in fucking...  That's right.  Yes.  I don't know.  Oh, that guy's from Youngstown.  That guy's hilarious.  Dude, check this out.  Why is his hair so fucking awful?  Well, because it's a bad hair piece.  Yeah, I know.  But he's got to know that by now.  Why doesn't he, you know, find something else?  Well, you know, here's the deal.  Or maybe it's his look now.  Well, look.  You know, he lived on a houseboat.  Okay? 
[02:41:00]  He's the only person, check this out, the only person ever to beat the government on  a RICO charge.  Wow.  And he defended himself.  He checked out.  He defended himself.  What does he have?  He knows something.  I pitched him for a show, and it's a long story, but he...  But you pitched him, or you pitched a show about him?  Well, they were...  Can I talk?  Oh, yeah.  Okay.  All right.  So, TruTV, they were looking for a companion piece for Jesse Ventura.  Oh, boy.  I went and said, look, I got Jim Traficant, you know, and I really didn't have him, but 
[02:41:30]  I got him real quick.  And quick.  But then they...  I guess the Jews didn't like him or something.  He said something about Israel, so they said, you know, we're not going to take him.  But it fucking cost me a lot of money.  And I got him.  But see, the guy is...  If you know about this guy in Youngstown, for example, when he was a sheriff and he  was shutting down everything in 82, like it's happening now where people are losing  their homes, he refused to foreclose homes.  So, as a sheriff, he became famous. 
[02:42:00]  Now, check this out.  This is really fun and great.  He got money to run from the Cleveland mob.  The other guy got money from the Pittsburgh mob.  So, when they said, hey, we want you to do something for you, when he got in, he said,  I'm not going to do it.  And they said, we're going to kill you.  So, he went on national TV, he said, here's the people who are going to fucking kill me.  And so, he became famous.  He had him in 60 Minutes.  And then he became a congressman.  And is that why they didn't kill him?  Because he actually, he was so vocal about it, they couldn't.  Yeah, he went right on.  He said, look, here's who's going to kill me.  And I can tell you the names. 
[02:42:30]  Because one of the guys was after me at one time.  But they were serious.  This is a serious shit.  Why would they be after you?  I was in prison for drugs.  A couple of things.  Little things that happened.  But how much time in prison?  Two.  Two years.  And you did too?  For pot, yeah.  For pot?  Yeah, a lot of pot.  A lot of pot.  Like a joint behind his ear.  Because there are a lot of people that get pissed off that people go to prison for pot.  But if it's a lot of pot.  It's a money-making venture. 
[02:43:00]  You know, I consider myself like Mitt Romney.  I was a job creator.  There you go.  You know, I created a job.  You know, so that's why.  How much did you get caught with?  Well, here's the deal.  How much do you admit to?  I was doing about 200 a year.  200 a month.  I do about 200 pounds a month.  And it was that shitty pot, that Mexican shit, back in the 70s.  Oh, my God.  Get a four-finger lid.  That's right.  For like nothing.  Three and a half.  Four.  Three and a half?  Yeah.  I do the Jewish three and a half.  Three and a half-finger lid. 
[02:43:30]  200 pounds a month.  And it was all like fucking stems.  And seeds, you had to take out your Yes album.  You fucking clean it like a can in gold.  I see good people.  See, these stems are taking all my time, all my way.  He knows.  He knows.  Exactly.  He knows that double album shit.  Or you try to just...  You'd get lazy and try to roll a joint and fucking stems are just poking through the paper.  Yeah.  Yeah, yeah.  Right, right.  And then a little smoke could come out of it.  Yeah, the fucking seed would go off like a rocket engine.  You'd just get this smoke going sideways off the thing. 
[02:44:00]  I got to tell you what I did.  This is so fucking cool.  I can't believe I'm telling you this.  Shit.  It was wrong.  First of all, I want to say it's wrong.  You remember the blackjack firecrackers?  I do not, no.  Well, I rolled a joint and stuck one in.  Oh, shit.  And this guy lights it.  He was on fucking mushrooms, right?  And the thing blows up.  It's like, pow!  And he goes, oh, oh.  And he thought his lip blew up and it was all the paper.  And he's like, he pulled his lip off.  He thought his lip blew up and it was the paper. 
[02:44:30]  I was fucking an idiot.  I don't know why I did that.  Holy shit.  I don't know why they even brought that up.  Yeah, that could like blow his lip off.  No, because when you said the seeds pop.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  So you didn't sell high-grade marijuana?  No.  There was fucking Mexican back then.  You know what was weird?  You would get good pot from, say, like, something that came in from Columbia.  And then if it had multi-colors, I would call it, say, rainbow pot.  It was just fucking bullshit pot, right? 
[02:45:00]  So I had the blacks and I had my black guy in a ghetto selling it.  Then I had the colleges.  So I had it all going, you know?  And it was going great.  I mean, I made a lot of money.  All right, where'd you fuck up?  Greed?  You got a little greedy?  Eh, I got a little greedy.  I drove a $150 car with a $1,000 stereo.  Yeah, yeah.  Long hair, carried a 9mm, you know?  And I looked like a fucking bum.  What happened was I go buy a 240Z because I said, I want to get some pussy.  Fuck this, man. 
[02:45:30]  Because I'm not.  Because I'm buying, like, I'm trying to find out, like, fourth down people would buy it from me.  Find out where they're getting the pot.  So, you know, I fucked up.  But I said, you know, fuck this, man.  I'm going to, you know, let people know, you know, fuck this.  I grew up poor.  I hate kids.  I had nothing.  So I bought me a 240Z.  All right.  And that brought a little tension.  So, and then I had some guys from Youngstown.  I used some money to it because everyone's, like, the black dudes.  Oh, my apartment burned up and your 10 grand burned up. 
[02:46:00]  Oh, great.  Then my hippie guy says, hey, they're not paying me.  Next thing I know, everyone owes me fucking money.  And I owe the other guy money.  And I said, I don't have it for you.  He said, well, you're going to come up with me.  You got a fucking 240Z.  And I'm like, the thing I know that they fucking come at me is shot fucking right through my windshield.  I mean, through my, not windshield, but the side window.  Holy shit.  Yeah, yeah.  I hit a pole.  I hit a pole.  And there was a bunch of, a big partier that I'd have been dead.  You know what I did?  They called my mother up, said they're going to throw acid in my eyes. 
[02:46:30]  I said, you tell them motherfuckers.  I'll come over.  I'll kill them.  I was crazy.  I was crazy.  I was 19.  I was fucking a nut.  I said, I'll kill them.  I'll kill the whole fucking family.  I come to find out later on, just to honest to God's truth, later on, years later, that the guy,  as they'll know from Youngstown, Joey Naples, he's wack now.  So fuck it.  It was 93.  He says, who's this guy?  He owes you money.  You threaten him.  You go to shoot at him.  He calls you up and friends you.  Why are you working for us?  Oh, wow.  I swear to God, it's a true story.  Yeah.  Wow. 
[02:47:00]  Yeah, crazy area.  Crazy area.  How'd you get busted, finally?  This friend wanted some Coke.  And I got out of the business.  I said, fuck this.  I'm getting out of the business.  Crazy, right?  And he come out of service.  He said, hey, can you get me some Coke?  So I sold him a gram.  And I knew it was shit.  I stepped on him with a herd of elephants.  I'm fucking shit Coke, you know?  And he went another gram.  I said, all right, fuck.  I'll get you another gram.  And then when he went a quarter, I go, something's not right. 
[02:47:30]  Oh, man.  So I go to meet him, and I take my dad's truck.  My dad was a roofer, his fucking guitar buckets and shit.  I park it there.  And I'm looking at him, and I see him light a cigarette.  Next thing I know, there's fucking dogs with the fucking guns on my head.  I'm not going anywhere, you know?  And he's a friend of yours?  Well, I thought he was.  What the fuck?  No, I thought you got set up by actually someone that was a friend of yours.  Yeah.  You didn't really know the guy.  I went to high school with him.  I did.  Can I say his name?  I don't give a shit. 
[02:48:00]  I don't say his last name.  I won't say his name.  All right.  But he was out in the service.  He comes home and says, hey, Bobby.  I says, David, how are you doing?  He goes, hey, man, can you do me a favor?  Oh, that's cool.  And I got out of the business.  I got out of the business.  I said, fuck this.  I'm out of the business.  That's some low shit.  Yeah, yeah.  So the gons and the dogs.  So I ended up going to prison for Coke, even though I didn't sell Coke.  Wow.  You sold a little bit.  No.  Here and there.  What do you sold to that guy?  But that was a favor.  I was doing a favor.  I wasn't selling it.  It's like, you know, you know what I mean?  It's like a favor.  How was prison? 
[02:48:30]  It was great.  Really?  It was the best thing that ever happened to me.  Turned your life around?  Turned my life around.  Cleaned up.  Started reading, you know.  You know, so I got in shape.  Fought.  Used to fight.  Go around in prison.  Fight fighters.  That was great.  Wait, you're a fighter?  Yeah, I used to fight.  Were you good?  I was great.  Yeah.  Was he, Jimmy?  I don't know.  I mean, I know he's telling the truth.  I just don't know.  I didn't know him then.  No, my brother beat Harry Aurora.  They ended up being a world champion.  But I wrestled in high school. 
[02:49:00]  I was a wrestler then.  But I fought.  And I went to a prison.  You know, track up.  You guys are jocks.  My number was Z-0-0.  I was a 91th inmate.  Zoo 91 was my fucking number.  I was a 91th inmate in a brand new prison because it was a federal and state joint prison combined.  And so I was in this new prison.  And I was eating healthy.  We were growing our stuff.  I got my teeth fixed.  You know what I mean?  Oh, it was a good prison, huh?  I was like, they called it a country club. 
[02:49:30]  So I would go and we'd start a fighting thing, a fighting team.  We'd go and fight other prisons.  And I fought in Western Penitentiary in Pittsburgh.  It was a maximum security prison.  I went back, man, Jimmy.  I swear to God.  I go there.  It was like 1,500 inmates.  Now, I got, you got to remember, I'm like 19.  And I look like I'm 14.  Oh, geez.  These guys want to fuck me.  Oh, my God.  I jump over three bind, bitch.  You get your ass, motherfucker.  You know, and I'm going in the ring.  There's 1,500 people pounding on the fucking table. 
[02:50:00]  And, you know, because all of a sudden, this guy comes out called Animal.  No teeth, fucking bald head.  And then Animal.  And they call me Rocky because Rocky at the time was out.  You know, like, and I'll jump on five, bitch, and get out.  Fuck you, man.  I'm trying to act tough going in the ring with these 1,500 people.  Guess what?  Like, I had that little weakness in my knee.  This fucking guy come out.  There's no way he used my weight because he wasn't there for weigh-ins.  I hit this guy about 10 times in his face. 
[02:50:30]  I swear to God, hard.  And I hit hard.  He looked at me and goes, I'm going to fucking kill you.  And I said, he beat the shit out of me, man.  He didn't knock me out, but he fucking beat the shit out of me.  I found out years later, I went back and do a show there, seven years later,  that he was in for killing three people with his hands.  Never lost a fight, ever.  In prison.  I fought this guy.  He fucked me up, man.  Oh, fuck.  Yeah, so, yeah.  Was he there when you went back and did the comedy show?  You know, I was trying to, that's where I was, I wanted to meet him.  No, he was in what they call lock-up. 
[02:51:00]  They had 23, they gave him 23-1, meaning 23 hours he was locked up.  He was only allowed out an hour.  And I wanted to meet him, and that's when I found out, when I went back,  that he was in for killing people with his hands, physically.  You know, and then they told me, you know, he's never lost a fight.  They leave him out of the fucking cage to go and fight.  Yeah, you're locked up 23 hours, and you're one hour as you get to go in the ring.  And fucking, yeah, you're going to lose.  This guy's doing push-ups all fucking day.  Like, who am I going to fight next? 
[02:51:30]  And it was me.  You know, like.  Holy shit, Bob.  But you never got to see him again.  No, I never got to see him again, but they told me the story about him.  When I went down back to the prison, I went to go do stand-up there seven years later.  And it was crazy.  Is it Golub or Gallup?  You know, the Jews say Golub.  Because someone's getting pissed at us.  Because it says on my sheet, Gallub.  No, it's G-O-L-U-B.  It is.  Right, but that's Golub.  Well, in Pennsylvania they said Golub, and in New York they said Golub.  They're Polish Jews or Russian Jews. 
[02:52:00]  I'm Polish, but I can be fucking Jewish.  Because we're meeting you for the first time.  Jimmy knows you as a funny stand-up.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Bob Golub.  Yeah, you see, Jimmy, his friends, I had left here.  I was here doing my shit, and I went to L.A., and I got three kids.  So, you know, I'm back out here to get my chops back again.  So we've known each other.  I know of him, but we never really hung that much.  And he hung with a friend of mine.  Voss.  Voss. 
[02:52:30]  We all, Vosses are wrong.  Oh, you know Voss.  Yeah, yeah.  I made his fucking career.  Fucking, oh, you're to blame for that?  I know, I know.  Yeah, him and Screech.  People fucking hate me.  Oh, did you encourage Screech to do stand-up?  I'm the one that got him in it.  Oh, shit.  He's not good at it.  He's horrible.  Okay, good, good.  All right.  No, no, I get a practical joke you've perpetrated on the public.  Maybe he's gotten better.  No, here's what happened.  I should have said it, because I haven't seen it for a while.  I did Saved by the Bell, the movie of the week.  The last one they did, the big one in Vegas. 
[02:53:00]  I don't know if you remember that.  It was like the last show that they did.  And I was the wise guy chasing them around.  I always get these wise guys parts, you know.  So he saw me working on a comedy club.  And he'd come, and I'd say, hey, you want your stand-up, you MC?  I'll get a minnow.  I'll close, and I'll bring you up, and you do your shit.  And then we sold a lot of tickets.  Yeah, sure.  Yeah, so I don't know if we'd call it exploit.  Now, you get out of prison after two years.  Yeah.  What's up with the sex in prison? 
[02:53:30]  Does it go down?  Very good.  But does it go down?  Because a lot of guys say it doesn't go down, as much as people think.  Well, the fact of the matter is, there was a...  I don't know how much time I got.  I can just tell you.  Dude, we're riding it to 10, so keep talking.  Yeah, you're good, man.  See, where I was at, no.  Because it was like we were in like huts, kind of like, you know, like it was a brand new prison.  It sounds like you were living better in prison than outside.  Well, I'll tell you this. 
[02:54:00]  I'll show you how this works in life.  There was a guy that was in there that...  I digress here just for a second.  No worries.  He knocks this guy out, his teeth out, with a pipe.  So they put him in prison, right?  This guy they put in prison gets his teeth fixed.  The guy, he knocks his teeth out, couldn't get his teeth fixed.  That's how it works.  You figure this shit out.  Right, right.  So the sex...  Think about that.  Yeah, think about that.  So there you go, the literal bullshit.  So the...  Yes, it does happen. 
[02:54:30]  But not to me.  But there was a guy that fucked with me, and I bit a piece of face off and spit it out.  Because he wasn't trying to fuck with me, but he reached underneath my ass and grabbed  my balls.  Holy shit.  Yeah.  And...  But I got even with him.  But they sent him back down to Western, and I was getting out.  I just wanted to get the fuck out.  See, when you've got a little left's time, they try to fuck with you to keep you in.  You know what I mean?  But I knew what I wanted.  I just wanted to get out, get my head clean, and just, you know, change my life. 
[02:55:00]  But, yeah, there are...  People get fucked.  There's no doubt.  Did you ever want to go back to the drug thing?  Go back to what?  Like, you know, dealing and all that.  No.  Well, yeah, things aren't going that good now.  Yeah, I wouldn't mind.  Maybe some little bit of pot, you know?  I interrupted you, but you were going somewhere.  I'm sorry.  No, just that this guy, he...  What happened was, I was a good wrestler, so I would take people down.  I was really able to...  I was, you know, snatching legs. 
[02:55:30]  And I embarrassed him.  He was, like, coming down from Western, and he...  So they would put people that were hard criminals into my place before they put them on the street.  You understand what I'm saying?  So just to kind of mellow them out before they go down.  And I embarrassed him.  And he would always want to show me how to box.  I'm good.  I'm good.  So when I embarrassed him, you know, taking him down, he said,  let's put on the fucking gloves.  And my trainer, Manny, goes, all right, he puts bag gloves on me and me, which is like three ounces.  You put 16 ounces.  I said, whoa, well, Manny, he's still 240.  I'm 135, you know? 
[02:56:00]  He said, fuck him, you know?  I said, Manny, I've got to fight him.  What the fuck are you going to fuck him?  I've got to fucking fight this animal.  So I fucking...  He came out, man, and we were just doing three-rounder.  I hit him in the stomach, and he went down.  He said, I hit him low.  So I embarrassed the shit out of him.  Everyone's going, hey, you let this little guy fuck with diseases.  He kept cute.  Hey, cutie, cutie.  He pinched my ass.  So I go to the ward, and I said, dude, listen.  They liked me because I was funny.  I was the first fighter they had.  I won trophies.  I could pitch us on trophies. 
[02:56:30]  So right before, about three weeks, I'm ready to get out.  I'm in the shower, and I see him, and I said, oh, fuck.  And he reaches under and grabs my balls.  And I grabbed him around his neck and bit him in his face and took him.  And I wrote him all the way down while my mom had him bit in his skin and spit it out.  He screamed and every shit.  And then the cards came in and took him away.  He wasn't trying to fuck me.  He was trying to fuck with me.  Right.  You don't reach around someone's ass and grab your balls.  I mean, I jerked off that night.  I got a little hornet fun. 
[02:57:00]  It felt kind of good.  It wasn't my hand.  It was just a new hand.  It's like, Dave, it's just a hand, right, Bob?  Yeah, yeah.  It was a different hand, you know.  Yeah, yeah, right?  Yeah, that's it.  It's a long time to have no one's...  That's right, that's right.  ...holds your own hand on them.  Fuck, you got stories.  And you did two years...  Not straight, not straight, but, you know, like, I was out, and they brought me right  back in, but, yeah.  Oh, jeez.  Now, when you...  Hey, why are they bringing you back in?  Well... 
[02:57:30]  You weren't ready to...  No, what happened was...  Change your life?  It's...  I mean, honest to God, it's such a long thing.  It's just...  I didn't do anything wrong, honest to God.  I was...  It's called perjury at a parole hearing.  I was actually on work release when I was there.  And, um...  Like an idiot.  I was making more money than guards.  And, uh...  I snorted some shit when I was on a construction site.  Uh-oh.  And they had me take a pee test.  Dude, I'm like...  I'm like frickin' drinking, like, this instant Maxwell House. 
[02:58:00]  You know, like, 20 of them, drinking them down, trying to get out of my  system.  Because they said, I got a P-Day.  Because they could check you.  They could check you.  Oh, man.  And so, like an idiot, it turned out to be PCP.  Oh, shit.  Well, I thought it was Coke.  So, when they asked me, I said, no, I didn't do no drugs.  They said...  I said, no.  They said, well, we found PCP.  I said, wow, I didn't do PCP.  So, when I got out, they brought me back in for perjury.  They wanted to get me, because they wanted me to snitch on everybody.  That's what they wanted to do.  There was a big sting going on.  And they wanted to get me to do it. 
[02:58:30]  And I said, fuck you guys, I'm not going to do it.  That's what they were trying to do.  I was...  I beat them in court one time for guns prior to that.  Yeah, I had a crazy, crazy fucking life for a few years.  It was like, I'm lucky to be alive.  I mean, I'm very blessed to be alive.  You know, that's why prison, you said, was a blessing.  I got off the drugs, and I got rid of...  You know, I'd either been dead from the drugs or from the guys.  Around some crazy characters.  Yeah, yeah.  So, when did you start stand-up? 
[02:59:00]  I got out of prison.  I, uh, then...  What year about?  Some people...  79.  79.  I went down to Fort Lauderdale.  And, you know, I...  That's when they just opened a comic strip, you know.  Can I plug where I'm working here?  Yeah, of course.  I'm working on a Broadway comedy club.  We're not going to say no.  Are you kidding me?  And a new club called the Village Comedy Club.  It's a new club in the village.  Where is it?  It's, uh, right on, uh...  On McDougal, right?  McDougal.  Yeah, Village Comedy Club and Broadway Comedy Club. 
[02:59:30]  Broadway's on 51st?  No, 53rd, between 8th and 9th.  Yeah, yeah.  And I did, uh, two shows last night.  I had three hours sleep.  I was so excited to do this show.  Well, I wanted to do this, man.  I wanted to, you know, love you guys, so...  Bob is a very, very entertaining comic, too.  Just so people know, too, he's not just a guy who did...  He's a very funny comic to see live.  So just people know that.  Yeah, just...  I was thinking about this show.  I'm listening to Tupac here, right?  Before me?  Tupac, yeah.  How do you say his name?  Oh, Tupac.  Tupac.  I kept thinking that, too.  It was like, yeah, Tupac. 
[03:00:00]  Yeah, I was saying Tupac.  Tupac and me.  Tupac, right?  Tupac, yeah.  Yeah, whatever.  It was, it's him and me.  You couldn't get...  I know, that's the beauty.  Yeah, yeah.  But Bob, where we sit, this is the beauty of the show.  It's unbelievable, yeah.  We can change directions like that.  I imagine the listeners are enjoying this segment a lot more.  Oh, all right.  I would say so.  I liked Tupac.  Yeah, he was good.  Absolutely, they were enjoying this.  No, but I'm just saying, you know, like I was listening, I'm going, you know, because  I can't pronounce the guy's name.  I'm not, you know, that, you know, that's smart.  But I know, I'm not being to be funny, either. 
[03:00:30]  I can't.  I thought it was Tupac, Tupac, or whatever.  Yeah, yeah.  And I found, then your guy told me, no, that guy's dead.  That was the rapper.  Yeah.  I can just figure it out.  So you went down to Fort Lauderdale.  So I went down to Fort Lauderdale in 79, and the comic strip had just opened up down  there.  And their first week, they had Seinfeld, Dennis Wolfberg, Carol Liefer, just an unbelievable  lineup, you know.  And I wanted to do stand-up.  I still had my first show on audio. 
[03:01:00]  And what I did was, I was so bad, I mean, it took me years.  It took me years to get good.  I mean, and what happened was, I'll never forget it.  I was a roofer.  I was doing it with my father.  It was a roofer, one of them.  And so I remember Live or Memorex, right?  I go on stage, so I had the glass, and I take a hammer, and there's a Live or Memorex.  And the owner said, listen, hey, you know, I know this is your first time, but that glass  thing, you got to, don't do that next time, because it's cutting the customers. 
[03:01:30]  So I had the tape sitting there, and this guy goes, this guy fucking stinks.  He's fucking horrible.  He goes, oh, shit, you hear him say, oh, I can hear him.  It's like my first show, because he fucking stinks.  He goes, I waste, what the fuck, when are they bringing the next guy?  You can hear the guy going, when the fuck they get, in New York, it was on Oakland Park  Boulevard, a place called, they're probably fucking closed now.  Yeah, probably.  Friendly's.  And the guy goes, this guy fucking stinks.  Fucking horrible fucking piece of shit. 
[03:02:00]  Stick to roofing.  And if he cuts me with that glass, I'll fucking kill him.  And I got it on tape still.  That's nice to have.  That's nice to have.  It is.  It is in a weird way.  Yeah.  Yeah.  So I started down there, and I thought that you get as good as your competition.  I was, you know, a wrestler and a fighter, so I went to L.A., and that's when Kenneth  and all those guys were there, and I got these things with him.  You're not.  You know, only when I came to New York in 94, where you could work and cut your teeth,  did I get good.  Yeah, yeah.  You could work every night. 
[03:02:30]  Fuck, I've been here a month and a half, and I've done 45 shows or something, you know.  So, you know, so that's what New York does to you.  So when I came in, so I started there, I went to L.A. from 80 to 84, and then I couldn't  get on stage.  And I was horrible, you know.  Like, I'm not educated, you know, but I can write.  I can write a script.  I can write, you know, a book, but I'm just not educated.  So when I listen to these comments, I'm like, what the fuck are they talking about?  I don't find the humor.  I don't find the funny.  I'm not talking about cock or fucking or anything.  You know, I didn't get it, you know. 
[03:03:00]  I like Kennison.  Oh, by the way, check this out.  I saw Pryor, after he got burnt, the first day after he got burnt, I watched for four  months every day.  We're at the store, right?  At the comic store.  And you would see a piece that was, like, not that good.  And then you would see it come together.  And that's when you see the brilliance of this guy.  You know what I mean?  I think, personally, I think he's one of the greatest fighters of all.  I mean, greatest comics of all time.  I think Muhammad Ali was the greatest fighter of all time.  That's what I meant, too.  But I got heckled by Muhammad Ali when I was out there. 
[03:03:30]  So I was there from 1884, and then I came to New York.  And that's when I met, you know.  Wait.  You can't pass over I got heckled by Ali.  Yes.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  There was a Playboy Club in Century City.  And Ali used to come there.  And Ali, there I am on stage, and Muhammad Ali is there, who my fucking idol, you know.  I mean, Ali, Muhammad Ali.  This is when he was able to speak, you know.  Now, at the end, it was like, I think him and Pryor was the only one who would understand each other. 
[03:04:00]  For the end, I'm fucking the only two people who would understand each other.  But no, he heckled me, and I got heckled by him.  And I was horrible.  I was horrible.  I couldn't get on stage, you know.  And I came to New York and moved to Staten Island.  And then I'd just, you know, start selling cars like I did out there.  I had a fucking demo.  I'd pick up the comics.  And, you know, back then in the 80s, you'd pick them up and drive them.  And I worked my way up from MC to middle and closing.  That's how I got a lot of work, too, driving guys. 
[03:04:30]  If you had a car, like I used to pick Otto up.  I used to live in Central Jersey.  I'd go to Queens, get Otto, and then drive back down past Jersey into Pennsylvania or into Delaware.  But you would go two and a half hours total out of your way.  Just to get some time on stage.  Just to get MC work.  And Levy, because he's such a drunkard where he was,  that Bobby would let me pick him up and go fucking, you know, because he couldn't drink and drive.  So it's amazing if you have a car, how much work you can get. 
[03:05:00]  Well, and people just think I had money because I sold cars.  So, you know, I'd have a different demo.  I'd go, where's this guy got money?  I said, you know, let him think whatever they want.  Otto, I got to tell you, when I left to go to L.A.  When I got to 93, I go to L.A.  93 or 83?  Oh, 93.  93, when I'm here in New York, I go to L.A.  Right?  So I let Otto stay at my place to take over my rent.  And this guy I met, and he called me up three months later.  He goes, what the fuck is with this guy?  He hasn't paid rent to fucking toilets and fucking everything. 
[03:05:30]  There's shit everywhere.  I go, I don't know what to tell you.  He's a friend of mine.  He goes, I got to throw him out of my fucking place.  He hasn't paid me any money.  And the fucking place is a wreck.  This guy says, oh, fuck, I don't.  Are you saying that Otto behaved irresponsibly?  I find that difficult to believe.  Go figure that one out.  It might have been George.  I don't know.  You know, Otto would blame him on anybody.  I find it hard to believe that Otto behaved irresponsibly in the fucking early 90s.  Wow.  How did you wind up getting that little part in Goodfellas? 
[03:06:00]  I read Wise Guys from Nicholas Pelagie.  And it was the first book I ever read back to back.  And there was a guy named Jimmy DeGene Burke in there, who I fucking loved.  And I related to him.  I actually became him.  Like, big family, prison.  I could relate to everything he did except kill people.  I never killed anybody, you know.  So I said, how do I get to Scorsese?  And, again, this is a long story, but I'll condense this.  I started doing research into Jimmy DeGene Burke. 
[03:06:30]  I went down to John Gordy's place down in Queens.  And I go, can I talk to John?  They go, oh, fuck, who the fuck are you?  I said, well, I want to ask him about Jimmy.  Jimmy DeGene, Scorsese, is doing the movie.  He goes, oh, fuck.  What are you?  Get the fuck out of here, you know.  So they, you know, naivete.  So I go down there.  You've got to be crazy to want to go talk to John Gordy.  Well, I was.  Holy fuck.  No, no, no, no.  But you've got to understand something, is that I was doing research.  Like, I was, I spent six months of my life figuring out how, all I wanted was an audition. 
[03:07:00]  Right.  I just wanted an audition.  First of all, they didn't know the name of the movie was going to be Goodfellas.  So I go down, and I'm, like, I go down to meet, try to meet John Gordy to find out about Jimmy DeGene.  I go to Lewisburg Prison in Pennsylvania.  He wouldn't meet with me.  And so I was trying to do research.  You know, I never acted.  I never, I don't know anything about acting.  I never studied.  I got nothing.  No agent, no manager.  So I found he had a lawyer.  Because, you know, you can call Screen Actors Guild and find out who represents somebody. 
[03:07:30]  Oh, right.  But no one represented Scorsese.  He had a lawyer.  So I would follow him around.  I'm jumping around, just so you can let me know, because it's long.  We're good.  Keep going.  So I would follow his lawyer around.  And this fucker was eating in expensive places.  But I wanted to make the, yeah, fuck.  Man, you know, but I wanted to make the right time to get him.  So I get him out of his bathroom, going into his office.  And I say, hey, I just drove in from Youngstown, Ohio.  I said, you know, Martin's doing this story.  But, yeah, well, come on in.  Geez, I'll give you a sec. 
[03:08:00]  So he gives me a couple minutes.  He goes, well, it's about six months away.  So I find out that Earl Winkler, who did all the Rockies, was producing it.  And Barbara DeFina was Scorsese's wife.  So I kept staying in contact while I was doing research.  So I met, found the daughter of Jimmy the Gent.  Okay?  This is when they had that club up in Yonkers.  Shooting Stars, I think.  I remember that.  I go there.  And these guys say, we thought they had this.  And they said, listen, now, we got to talk to you.  So they're picking me in the car. 
[03:08:30]  One's in the front.  One's in the back.  I'm in the front.  I think I'm going to get fucking.  I'm thinking I'm going to get this.  He says, hey, what are you doing?  What do I do?  We know what you're doing.  You're going, you can't talk to the daughter.  I said, well, she's got a place down there.  What's your tightest section here in New York?  Little Italy.  Little Italy.  I said, I don't know.  He goes, you can't do that.  You can't do that.  And I think, well, I said, well, I'm just trying to find out about the guy.  Well, I think they're going to fucking kill me, right?  But then they own the club, and I'm closing.  So I figure they can't kill me. 
[03:09:00]  Who's going to close the show?  I'm like, this is like in the back of my head, you know.  So I said, look, I'll leave her to go just doing research.  So they end up taking me and telling me a little bit about him, about how he smoked and all that.  So I finally get called in for a general meeting, which I didn't know what a fucking general meeting was.  And Barbara DeFina, who was Scorsese's wife, said, yeah, let's meet the kid.  You know, he's crazy with Scorsese.  I mean, you know, the gaudy thing. 
[03:09:30]  So I go in.  And I dressed, hair slicked back, 3,000, pinky ring, fucking 9 millimeter, the whole thing, the chains, and 2,000 cash.  I think I got one shot to meet Scorsese.  I don't fucking know.  The lady says to me, I said, hey.  She goes, well, we just have a general meeting, and I have handcuffs.  So I said, you could take this, you could get two grand, you could take this here.  And she goes, you know, I think you're going to leave.  I don't know.  It's a general fucking meeting.  I have no idea.  Now, I'm thinking maybe I should handcuff her, because if I handcuff her, I'll get to meet Scorsese. 
[03:10:00]  You know, and then, you know.  You sure have poor judgment.  Yeah, yeah.  Holy shit.  So this is really an unbelievable situation.  There's this point in your life where I got six months invested.  And I'm looking her in the eye.  And she goes, you've got to go.  Because I'll never forget, because in her office, it's a really good-looking casting director. 
[03:10:30]  Behind her was the one that cast for Woody Allen.  It's like, you're on the phone.  And she goes, well, you know, this was a general, and you can't do this.  And I said, well, I'm going to handcuff her.  But then I says, fuck.  I'm not going to handcuff her.  I'll go.  I'm on a train now.  You know, playing that shit.  I'm on a train now, like, fucking crying like a little baby.  Six months of my life, I blew this.  You know, I get a call two weeks later.  She says, look, Marty will meet you.  Okay, you come in and get some sides.  But no gun. 
[03:11:00]  Marty don't like guns.  Don't come with the hair slicked back.  Just come as you.  You know, so I went in.  I got the sides.  I went in and I read for the part of the diner where they kept burning down the diner.  And that singer ended up getting it.  Oh, yeah.  Tony Darrow.  Yeah.  So the part of I have a fag.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Oh, I'm in there.  And I go in.  And there's Martin Scorsese.  And he goes, he goes, oh, I go, I thank you for bringing me in.  He goes, yeah, I heard about the thing with, uh, God, you're fucking crazy.  All right.  Yeah, right.  Yeah.  Right. 
[03:11:30]  Right.  Right.  Right.  I snatched the fun guy.  Pull him over the table.  No, no.  You wouldn't do that.  He's the godfather.  You wouldn't do that.  Okay.  Just so he's listening to it.  And I get there.  He goes, thanks for coming in.  And now I achieved what I wanted to achieve.  I leave Time Warner building.  I'm about six months.  I first got to say, I said, my God, I just met in Martin Scorsese.  And he goes, fuck, I give a fuck about it.  I just kept walking by some, some guy, random guy, you know.  And they called me two weeks later.  They said, Marty loves you.  He's going to find something for you in a movie.  So they did.  And one of the most memorable lines. 
[03:12:00]  Yeah.  Well, you sure delivered it authentic.  Yeah.  Well, it's not real.  You know, you know, the thing of it was is there's a guy, there's this comic that told  me all these black comics that I improvised the lines.  And I said, wait, see, it was in a script.  So after a while, they kept saying, I kept saying, you know what, all right, it was one  nigga, I had it too.  Forget it, all right?  If that's what you want to hear about it, you know.  But that was, it was in a script.  What do you want from me?  Did you meet John Gotti?  How angry you are. 
[03:12:30]  No, no.  What happened was, when I went down.  They stopped you at the door.  Yeah.  The guys were out there, you know.  And I think at that time, they probably had the cameras and everything.  And I was probably on tape somewhere with the FBI.  And they probably said, they might have thought I was a jokester or, I don't know.  I don't know what they thought.  I didn't, I didn't have no concept of that because of naivete.  I just figured, hey, you know, Scorsese, he's doing this film, you know, and I said, I  want to talk.  And they thought I was like, kind of nuts. 
[03:13:00]  And they actually said something like, you know, what?  I said, I'm an actor.  I was like, act like a fucking runner.  Get the fuck out of it.  What are you fucking?  And I remember the big necks, the typical stuff you would see in a film.  And it was like, you know, big fucking necks and stuff.  But, you know, I mean, I didn't give a fuck because I just, all I wanted was an audition.  Wow.  Yeah, yeah.  Well, most people wouldn't walk up and just request to speak to God.  He said, that's probably something that people at the door aren't used to hearing.  Sure.  We got Otto.  He wants in on us.  Oh, Otto.  Otto. 
[03:13:30]  Hello.  Hi, Otto.  How you doing, Bob?  Hey, what's up, buddy?  How you doing?  Love you, man.  I trust your apartment.  No, yeah, that guy, Staten Island or whatever, when I left.  Remember you stayed there or no?  Yeah, it's St. George.  I remember.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  That was when they tried to blow up the tires the first time.  I remember watching that from the street down there.  93.  Yeah.  Yeah.  What's going on?  Nah, just hanging out.  Jimmy was kind enough to bring me in here with these guys. 
[03:14:00]  It's great, man.  Just having a great time.  Tell him about Goodfellas.  I just told him about Goodfellas.  I was telling him some of the parts about that.  I can't tell the whole thing because it's a freaking two-hour thing.  Okay.  But, you know, I told him bits and pieces.  I'm working on a one-man show on it.  So, but we had some good times, Otto, huh?  Absolutely.  I lived in Brighton Beach, yeah.  Oh, Jesus Christ.  I might get home at 6 o'clock in the morning and Chips Cooney's still down there figuring 
[03:14:30]  out how he could do a line.  He's like, he's like searching on the floor.  What, is that Lent or is that, should I snort that?  No, I think that's Lent.  A lot of people have snorted things that had nothing to do with coke.  Yeah.  It's like, oh, yeah.  Yeah, and you're so paranoid.  You're peeking out the window and you're on the 80th floor like, who's going to come?  Fucking Spider-Man?  You're fucking freaky.  You're fucking tweaking.  Get off.  It's the fucking 80th floor.  From the first blast of the night, the whole night becomes, I need more coke.  Yeah, yeah.  It doesn't matter.  What a fucking horrible. 
[03:15:00]  Yeah, yeah.  But I mean, you know, we got through it.  We're survivors.  I mean, I don't know about you.  I don't know your guys' background, but.  You know, it was the 80s.  Might have partaken in a little bit.  Yeah, yeah.  Well, when I was in Florida, Fort Lauderdale, 79.  It was far more than the fucking skies.  Oh, man, right?  It was literally, I heard this bump and this guy, I'll never forget, I keep saying Jewish  guy having to be a fucking Jew.  Sorry.  80 pounds fell in his backyard and he calls the cops and he came and picked it up because 
[03:15:30]  they were falling and they were just dropping off.  By the way, when I was down.  $100 a gram, Norton.  What's that?  $100 a gram, Norton.  I knew he said.  $100 a gram, Norton.  Well, hey, Otto, I got to, hold on, I got to tell him this.  When I was down in Fort Lauderdale, we went to pick up the Cubans.  You know, they had the Mario Boatlift and this guy I knew's father had a boat and you  could go pick up the Cubans for $500 a head.  Wow.  Yeah, yeah.  And so we were going to go over there and get them and this guy's boat, we could get 
[03:16:00]  like 20 at a time.  We would do about three runs, make some quick money.  Were they nice to you when they'd get on the boat?  Well, here's the deal.  They start finding out they were seizing some of the boats.  If Castro was one of the guys there, like the boat, they would take the fucking boat.  This is when they were, so this kid said, I can't do that.  This is my father's boat.  So we're going to go pick up some Cubans for $500 a head.  Now, now I can pick up a whore for, I think, a 50.  Where was the money coming to pay you for each of these reject criminals? 
[03:16:30]  Who was paying you the $500?  Who's fucking interviewing me?  You or them?  What the fuck is this?  No, they would get.  I would imagine they didn't have $500.  No, no, no, no.  Yes, it was $500 a head on that.  I never forget figures.  They had it, I mean.  Yeah, it was $500 a head.  I never forget.  One thing, I'm not that bright, but I never forget numbers.  Was it from them or from the government to bring them back?  You know, I, honest to God, don't remember.  I really don't remember that, but I never, and I'm not joking here, but my kid's brilliant 
[03:17:00]  in math.  My wife's a CPA, and I used to sell drugs, so you figure he'd be fucking good, right?  He's fucking brilliant in math.  I never forget numbers.  It was $500 a head.  I don't know.  I don't think it was the government.  I think they were paying $500 a head, each person, for us to pick them up, but that's  what people were doing.  They were running and picking them up.  I'm amazed that they were able to get $500.  Well, I mean, if you want to get out of the country, you save it.  You'll figure it out, right?  Yeah, you'll figure it out.  Yeah.  Huh.  Sir?  Oh, are you barking?  Is that a new character? 
[03:17:30]  Hey, Otto, I've got to see you before I get out of here, man.  I'll be at the stand Thursday night, tomorrow night.  You'll be where?  Oh, okay.  It's a stand.  It's a new club.  It's a good club in New York.  Where is it, Otto?  I'm doing, I guess it's like 20th and 3rd.  Okay.  Yeah, I did a set there.  It's really good.  Hey, have you been to the Broadway Comedy Club?  What?  Have you been to Al's Club, the Broadway?  No, Al's got a lot of clubs in the city, but, you know, New York is for people with careers. 
[03:18:00]  I don't have a career.  I have an act.  No, it's nice.  No, you've got to go to the new one, Village Comedy Club.  It's really nice.  I'm not, I'm, it's fucking, it's nice.  It's a nice club.  Okay.  I'll get over there.  I'm doing the stand Thursday.  Why don't you come down, man?  Well, I'll come down.  I'm leaving set.  I haven't seen my kids for fucking almost two months.  I'm fucking like a, like a little baby.  You're crying.  So, I got to see my kids.  But I'll come down and see you.  Come down Thursday.  I got nothing to do with Thursday. 
[03:18:30]  I'm off.  Yeah, that would be awesome.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I'm glad you got your plug in.  You got your fucking plug in, all right?  I love Otto.  How many times are you going to bring the fuck?  Okay, the stand Thursday.  All right, fuck.  Fuck go up.  I don't care where he's at.  The prison.  It was under orders from Trish to call in.  Hey, but, hey, but, Otto, tell these people who the toughest comic in the business is.  Bob can fight.  He's absolutely a scrapper.  No, but who's the toughest motherfucker?  You know, I'd beat anybody's ass.  I would say Rogan. 
[03:19:00]  You know what?  I got to tell you something.  I like Rogan, and I think he's a tough fucking guy, but, see, he's, you know, I'd have to  hit him with a brick.  I'll be honest with you.  Rogan's a pretty tough fucking guy.  Yeah.  But I'm not afraid of him.  Hit him with a subway.  I'm going to fight that motherfucker, huh?  What's that?  I said hit him with a subway.  That might work.  Yeah.  I'll hit him with George.  I know you would go on Rogan in that scrap, but, you know, most comics are pussies.  You could win most battles.  Yeah.  No, dude, you know me. 
[03:19:30]  See, I'm not afraid of anybody, but that doesn't make, you know, I'm 55 now.  I'm still fucking fighting.  What's wrong with me?  I would love you to hit Voss.  You know how happy that would make me?  I wouldn't want to mess up his new teeth.  Do you think they look good?  I have no.  No.  They look like the ugliest.  They look fake.  I mean, look, here's the deal.  Don't have a hairpiece if it looks bad.  You know, I had, you know, Al Martin had a hairpiece, and I said, it looks horrible, so I shot a wad in it, right?  And this is true.  I shot a fucking wad in Al's hairpiece. 
[03:20:00]  We were working.  Hey, Otto, you done with your plug?  Yeah.  All right.  I'm going to come down and see you.  I love you, man.  I miss you, man.  Thanks, Bob.  Have a good day.  All right, brother.  The dog is barking.  No, this guy had a hairpiece.  A mess.  And it was a fucking hairpiece.  Now, we're down in Florida, and they went and put the other comic up.  I said, well, fuck it.  I want to bring my buddy down to Al Martin.  So I said, you can stay with me.  So we had two beds, right?  So he's a big, kind of robust guy, and he's on the side, so he's fucking farting and snoring. 
[03:20:30]  I'm not lying.  And I said, so I had to fucking lean him over for one, block one of those fucking holes.  So his hairpiece is on the thing.  And I said, you know what?  I'm going to shoot a fucking wad in this.  Because I told him, I said, get rid of this fucking hairpiece.  You look like fucking Fred Flintstone.  So worst fucking hairpiece in my life.  And you know the acting?  You know how much of an actor you have to be to imagine that to be a pussy?  I mean, I had to fucking, like, imagine this nasty fucking hairpiece. 
[03:21:00]  So I shoot a fucking wad in this thing.  And he wakes up.  He goes, what did you do?  Come on.  I didn't do it.  I had to do it in the bathroom.  And I bring it to put it on the thing.  He goes, what did you just do?  I just shot a fucking wad in your hairpiece.  It was a fucking $15 hairpiece.  I go, that's the worst fucking, you got ripped off.  And he goes, I ain't going to wear that.  I go, that's what I'm telling you.  Now you never wore a hairpiece after that.  Yeah, I've never seen him with one.  That's what, yeah.  That was it.  Yeah, yeah.  I mean.  You did him a favor.  I did him a favor.  But think about it.  You got to fucking jerk off.  Look at this fucking hairpiece. 
[03:21:30]  I got to look at his vagina.  A hairy fucking vagina, you know.  You've lived a life, Bob.  Yeah, I've been a life.  But I'm a survivor.  I'm still around, man, you know.  You do any drugs or alcohol these days?  No.  I smoke a lot of pot.  I've taken a break because I'm out.  And, you know.  But, yeah, I've been clean, you know.  Keep my head clean.  I got three kids, you know.  What age is?  Six, 11, and 14.  Damn.  Yeah, young.  Yeah. 
[03:22:00]  And so, you know, I don't know.  You guys got kids at all?  No.  I got one.  I'm married.  One on the way.  Yeah.  Another one on the way any, like, hour at this point.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  Any day.  Wow.  Wow, yeah.  It changes.  You know what?  Honest to God, it changes your life.  I mean, they're good kids.  They're good kids.  I will tell you a story.  I can tell you a pot story.  They had one of those play day bullshits.  And a couple years ago, right, they're fucking, first of all, I was telling your guy, your  booker, my fucking son calls me up. 
[03:22:30]  He's in Malibu.  And I go, where are you?  He goes, I'm with Nardine at some place.  I'm not some guy, weird fucker, got a bunch of dogs named Bob Dill.  I said, Bob Dillon?  I said, put your friend on.  He goes, yeah.  I said, you're Bob Dillon's house?  He goes, yeah.  I go, the fuck?  I grew up poor.  Eight kids in a fucking small town.  He's at Bob Dillon's house.  They got all these contacts.  So I used my kids.  Play dates.  They're very simple.  The mother's got to be good looking, or they've got to be able to do something for my fucking  career.  That's it.  That's it, right?  So they're not supposed to come up to the loft. 
[03:23:00]  Because I'm working, right?  So two years ago, I take a little hit.  I blow it out the fucking window.  So Peyton comes up.  And I says, Peyton, what are you doing up here?  He says, I want to show my friend the loft.  And he goes, yeah, what's that smell?  I go, that's my medicine.  I swear to God, his friend goes, my dad's medicine smells the same way.  I said, well, we had the same doctor.  I had to fucking cover myself.  Jesus.  Yeah, because I have a license where I live.  There's a...  Medical.  Well, yeah. 
[03:23:30]  You need it, medically.  Well, I got colitis, so it helps me.  It helps my shits.  Oh, do you shit a lot?  No, I'm good now.  I'm good now.  I'm good now.  I got my shit under control.  But if you don't know about that, you know about colitis?  Yeah, it makes you shit a lot.  Yeah, but I'm good.  I drank some coffee today.  I haven't shit.  I have a friend that had it.  Or has it, I guess.  Has it, yeah.  Are they liquidy shits?  You don't really get rid of it, right?  Well, yeah, I take medicine.  You control it a little bit.  Yeah, I take medicine on it.  But I'm good.  You know what it is?  Honestly, stress. 
[03:24:00]  They will never fucking tell you guys.  And I know your stress is a motherfucker.  You know what I'm saying?  Like, look at this.  This is your body.  This is now, unstressed.  Now I feel stress coming on.  I say, fuck it.  I eat stress and fuck you.  I eat it right up.  So I don't get stressed out no more and I'm okay.  You know, I've been, you know.  But it fucks you up.  Yeah, it's terrible.  Stress is fucking terrible.  Wow.  Are we done?  I'd say after it's about 10-10.  Yeah, I guess.  Our show is finished for the day.  Bob, you certainly come back. 
[03:24:30]  I'd love to come back.  Thank you very much.  He's a very enjoyable man.  Jimmy was right.  Because I didn't know about you.  He goes, trust me, Bob is...  I love Bob.  Bob is awesome.  You know, can I tell you, I was here about 10-12 years ago.  On our show?  Yeah.  With who?  I came here and I was only on for a few minutes and I couldn't mention Howard.  Oh, wow.  I was here that long ago when I went to say his name.  You go, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.  Because, yeah, I couldn't mention Howard.  Because I...  Can I say it now?  Yeah.  Oh, I couldn't mention Howard Stern's name.  Well, it's way back at N.E.W.  And... 
[03:25:00]  Oh, we...  You know what?  That wasn't us, though.  Yeah, it was.  No, I mean, it wasn't us.  Oh, no, I know that.  I know, but you just...  Oh, yeah.  He had such a...  Because I taught him what bitch smack was.  He didn't even know what it was.  It's old.  It's old now, but he had such a hard-on for us.  Right.  And then you...  He insisted we weren't allowed to mention his name.  Yeah, and I went to say and you go...  It was a whole fucking thing.  Yeah, this was like, fuck, what, maybe 12 years ago, possibly?  Yeah.  Wow, yeah.  I guess I'm memorable.  But, yeah, all right.  Let's get the plugs out properly. 
[03:25:30]  Bob will be at the Broadway Comedy Club, which is on 53rd between 8th and 9th.  When are you there?  I'm there tonight, and tonight also at Greenwich...  No, Village Comedy Club.  At the Village Comedy Club on McDougal Street.  Is it Greenwich?  No, no, is it Greenwich?  Fuck.  It's in the Village.  I don't know.  Look for Village Comedy Club.  It is Village.  Village is in the name.  I know that much.  And just find out.  These are very easy things.  Just look them up online.  But Bob is very, very funny and a very entertaining stand-up, so I recommend him highly. 
[03:26:00]  And I got a Twitter, right?  Are you on Twitter?  Oh, yeah, yeah.  Polish Madman.  But I took it off my Facebook, because you guys were laughing at me, because I had a fucking  nickname.  The Polish Madman.  They called me the Polish Madman, and I ended up fucking doing it, and I took it off.  I went, yeah, you got a little gimmick, Polish Madman.  So I took it on my fucking Facebook, but I left it on Twitter.  So, you know, if you want to fucking do that.  You try a little something, and they just attack you for having a gimmick.  Oh, of course they do.  No, you know what happened was some paper. 
[03:26:30]  Why don't you just knock your teeth out?  No, some fucking, some guys called me the Polish Madman in an article.  So I used it.  And then they went, hey, Polish Madman, you're a little gimmicky.  So now I just took it on my Facebook.  But I left it on the Twitter thing, because I fucking...  Let's get them some followers.  Let's follow the Polish Madman.  Not the.  It's just Polish Madman.  Yeah.  Polish Madman.  Yeah, tell me to buy my fucking DVD.  I'm getting ripped off.  Dodo.  It's a good thing.  It's about that when I grew up. 
[03:27:00]  Cool, man.  Anybody else?  Jimmy?  No, October, I believe, October 25, 26, 27, my first show's ever at the Philly Helium.  It's selling well, so thank you.  And I think October 19th, I'm in...  That's a great club, by the way.  Vegas.  It is good.  I've done a guest set there once, and I loved it.  October 9th, Club Madrid in Henderson, Nevada, right outside of Vegas.  I've done it once.  It's a great, great club, so I'll be there.  That's it.  Cool.  Nice.  And Bob, I fucking love you, and I'm happy.  Yeah, and if anybody's looking to hire me, I'd like to fucking work. 
[03:27:30]  I've got three kids, you know, you fucks.  Three kids?  Three kids.  That's why I'm not working, I guess.  Fuck.  The Opie and Anthony show is pretty much over.  Pretty much over.  Pretty much over.  But if you feel like sticking around after Monday Live is next.  Next.  Next.  Next.  Next. </pre>
