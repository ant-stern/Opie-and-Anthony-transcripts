<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opened with a seemingly intoxicated Larry King introducing a segment about Pluto's reclassification. Opie, Anthony, and Jim Norton engaged in a vulgar and rambling discussion about the scientific reasoning behind the decision, veering into tangents about the flat-earth theory and their own lack of scientific knowledge. They then watched and reacted to two 1950s educational films: one on the solar system (prompting more off-topic jokes) and another on party-throwing, which became the source of sexually charged and racially insensitive humor due to the film's outdated social norms.  John Amos was mentioned as a later guest.

The show continued with a fictionalized, extremely graphic depiction of a chaotic 1950s party, filled with absurd and offensive games, violence, sexual acts, and drug use. This segued into listener-submitted "F.U." messages and a rapid-fire discussion of various news items: a Tom Brady football game, Fiona Apple's music videos, a taser incident at a sporting event, an NYPD officer's death, Manny Ramirez's arrest, and Sebastian Janikowski's field goal record. A brief interview with Christian Slater occurred, followed by more "F.U." messages and another mention of John Amos's upcoming appearance.

The next segment focused on the death of Arkansas weatherman Brett Cummings, found dead with a naked man in a bathtub, prompting speculation from the hosts.  A heated debate about the Republican presidential primary, particularly Rick Perry and Mitt Romney's Social Security stances, ensued, featuring a caller arguing vehemently with Anthony.  This was followed by the much-anticipated in-studio interview with John Amos.

The interview with John Amos covered his career, starting with lighthearted banter and progressing to discussions about his time in professional football (including being cut multiple times and a three-day jail stay in Liberty, Missouri, after his motorcycle was stolen), his acting career in *Roots* and *Good Times* (including details about his relationship with J.J. Walker and creative differences with the writers), and his current play, "Felony Friday," which he promoted extensively.  Amos also shared anecdotes about fans viewing him as a father figure and promised to return to recite a poem. After his departure, the hosts discussed Amos's age, his possible conflicts with Walker,  their own clothing styles, Louis C.K.'s FX series, and Jimmy Norton's upcoming appearances, concluding with a humorous song about hipsters.

The show's final segment featured an in-studio performance of a "Dickhead" song about hipsters.  The majority of this segment focused on post-show activities and conversations between Sam Roberts and Club Soda Kenny, punctuated by calls from listeners David from Israel and Coke Logic.  The conversation involved a new intern (Sal), Kenny's Facebook page, and a perceived conflict between Kenny and Troy. Chip joined later, contributing rambling, vulgar, and sexually suggestive anecdotes and jokes.  The segment concluded with Sam announcing the end of the show and Chip promoting his YouTube series, "Chipper TV."  The overall tone was informal and comedic, relying heavily on profanity and offensive language, with Opie and Anthony's absence being a recurring point.  Other SiriusXM employees, including Eric, Pips, and Roland, briefly participated.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  And now, and now, the moment you've all been patiently waiting for.  Today's Opie and Anthony show starts now. 
[00:00:30]  Opie and Anthony show starts now. 
[00:01:00]  Opie and Anthony show starts now. 
[00:01:30]  Opie and Anthony show starts now.  Opie and Anthony show starts now. 
[00:02:00]  Opie and Anthony show starts now. 
[00:02:30]  Opie and Anthony show starts now. 
[00:03:00]  What the hell am I doing here? 
[00:03:30]  Wait a minute.  You want me to intro the Opie and Anthony show?  You got it.  You got it.  Hey, it's Larry King welcoming you to the Opie and Anthony show right here on Sirius XM Satellite Radio.  Oh, fuck yeah.  Oh, fuck yeah.  This place is insane.  You guys like to cuss on that.  Yeah, that's a lot.  Yeah, that's a good show.  Great guests, interesting interviews, and of course, your phone calls as well.  It's not the most talked about, not the most written about, and certainly not the most listened to show in the history of radio.  What, I'm still proud to intro the show is so disorganized. 
[00:04:00]  This show is so disorganized.  Holy shit.  It's so fucking bizarre.  Everybody's not politically correct.  Opie and Anthony were saying this.  Well, then turn off God dang Opie and Anthony, you dumbass.  We're experts.  We already know this is going to be great radio, so shut the fuck up.  Where else are you going to be able to say that and get paid for it?  Now, ladies and gentlemen, it is with great pride that I presented this, by the way, one of the highlights of my career, the Opie and Anthony Show.  By the way, who's Jim Norton? 
[00:04:30]  Good morning, everybody.  Yes, morning to you.  In the world, as a matter of fact, worldwide.  Worldwide now.  Amazing, right?  Aren't we?  Something like that.  That's cray cray.  Something with the intratubes.  I want to broadcast to that New Earth they found.  Super Earth?  You saw Super Earth?  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, there's fucking life out there, man.  You think?  Oh, my God.  Come on.  It's better than the crap that's on this fucking rock.  This stinks. 
[00:05:00]  Get me off.  Get me off of it.  Sure.  How far is the New Earth?  It's like a couple hundred miles.  A couple hundred miles.  Wouldn't it be funny if it was just hiding behind the moon the whole time and we just didn't notice it?  Yoo-hoo.  I guess it's so far away we actually can't see it.  We're, what, bouncing some kind of shit off it and we know it's there?  It's one of those?  Oh, yeah.  It's one of those things those space guys say, look, you ain't going to see it.  But we know because of the way some kind of light bends and stuff that something's there. 
[00:05:30]  But we don't know what the fuck it is.  Hey, if you're in school, how many planets are they teaching the kids?  When we were growing up, what was it?  Nine.  Nine, right?  And I remember sitting in class going, this is bullshit.  There has to be more than nine planets.  Look up in the sky, all those dots, something's going on up there.  Yeah, but there's more planets in the universe and in the galaxy than nine.  But in our solar system, there's, I still agree with the nine.  I know they found some sub-planets beyond Pluto. 
[00:06:00]  And then they've said that Pluto itself isn't really a planet.  They're teaching eight now.  Are they teaching eight?  Classified as eight because Pluto is not a planet.  They're teaching eight.  Pluto is not a planet?  Yeah.  What are they teaching, Sam?  Why isn't Pluto a planet?  It's a round thing.  Too small.  Like the rest of them.  It's more of a testicle.  What, Sam?  Jim is right.  Pluto is classified as a testicle, not a planet.  A testicle?  That's right.  Dr. Kaku?  Wait a minute.  Oh!  Sorry, I didn't mean to ask you a question.  I was thinking how much Pluto would weigh if you threw Pluto like a little cookie man. 
[00:06:30]  Somebody would drink and hit me when I was small.  I would be doing math and they would punch the side of my face.  Yeah, Pluto is not a planet anymore.  But why?  It's an object up there and it's rotating and it's like, it's going round and round.  The sun is too small.  How small is Pluto?  It's actually about as big as this coffee cup.  We just have really good coffee.  Winging around.  That's a good improv by me.  I heard it.  I said coffee cups and we had really good, I was going to say, tell us coffee. 
[00:07:00]  I think it's very odd that it is in an orbit around the sun.  It isn't in a belt of meteorites and meteors, so it wouldn't classify as that.  But who came out and when did they come out and just say, hey, by the way, no, it's not  a planet anymore.  Yeah.  Why isn't Pluto a planet anymore?  Apparently there's an answer.  Yeah.  August 24, 2006, I guess they said that wasn't a planet.  That's right.  It was a significant day in the history of planetary science. 
[00:07:30]  No, it wasn't.  Yes.  It was just a day.  I've got the story of a different, it was really the first day they were, it was the  official scientific definition of the word planet.  Okay, they discovered it was smaller than they thought at first, even smaller than Mercury.  All right.  Well, Mercury is a planet though anyway.  That's true.  Yeah.  They knew its path around the sun was more elongated than the other planets.  So elongated that it is closer to the sun than Neptune for about 20 years of its 248 
[00:08:00]  year orbital period.  Wow.  So it crosses in front of Neptune and becomes the eighth, if it was still a planet, eighth  planet out in the solar system for 20 years.  Boy, you know, and that's just like a wink.  That's a blink.  That's not even a wink.  That's, that's the beginning of a wink.  I don't care what time.  I don't care what you do for a living.  Our lives don't mean shit, including ours. 
[00:08:30]  I say including ours because we're broadcasting like our, like our lives are important.  248 years it takes for one year, for one year to go by in Pluto on Pluto.  It's 248 fucking years.  They suspected that a Pluto, that's a long time to wait for your birthday.  How many, how many birthday candles sold on Pluto?  Right, we don't even get a birthday if we're on that planet.  No, you don't.  There's a bunch of ones, but there's no twos yet.  One person has survived to their second birthday.  No.  No one knows the words to the song.  They very rarely have to say it. 
[00:09:00]  Happy birthday.  How's that go?  Any else, any other pertinent information on Pluto not being a planet?  Oh yes.  They realized that it was probably one of many large ice bodies in a distant region of the  solar system called Kui Purr.  Kui Purr, right.  Boring.  Kui Purr.  Yeah.  Uh, they even...  Kui Purr, purr, purr, purr, purr, purr, purr, purr, purr, purr.  My favorite part of this so far is the fact that you know it's Kui and Purr, but you amended 
[00:09:30]  it when Kui to make it fit.  Well, you know, you have to do that.  Yeah, they're adorable.  And by the way, was scratching his own...  I was scratching under my chin like I would a little kitten.  Adorable.  Is Pluto trying to get back into the planet thing?  Yeah.  Anyone lobbying this?  Yes.  Is it protesting this?  I mean, there are still arguments in the scientific community, but it looks as though...  Did you see the signs outside the planetarium?  There's a bunch of guys yelling, Jupiter's are queer.  Fuck Saturn. 
[00:10:00]  Reinstate Pluto?  Yeah.  Neptune's a something lover.  I couldn't see the entire...  It's a whole war going on.  Pluto.  You know somewhere there is.  And I'm for Uranus.  Yes.  What are you doing here?  Nerds to Pluto.  Pluto.  I don't know.  Pluto's smaller than our own moon, huh?  Yeah.  Is it really?  So then, what's up with the moon?  Is that a planet now?  No, the moon's always a moon.  A natural satellite around our...  But why are we deciding what's a moon and what's a planet? 
[00:10:30]  Well, we are scientists.  My thing is, if you go walk on it, it's a fucking planet.  Well, a moon has a...  That's a solid argument.  Yeah.  Why not?  Can you walk on the sun?  It rotates around a planet.  Huh?  A moon rotates around a planet.  Who says that shit?  Well, the scientists.  Did he ask God?  Meet you, cock.  Or whoever the fuck created all this?  He would probably say, no, that's a planet, too, you dummies.  But it was walked on, and nobody's walked on, like, the satellites that broadcast Sirius.  Oh, that's silly.  So how could the moon get a satellite? 
[00:11:00]  I say there's a satellite.  It's a natural satellite.  It just means it's in orbit.  I say there's two planets, Earth and the moon, because both have been walked on.  Wow, why don't you just go back to we're the center of the universe, and the Earth is flat and rests on a tortoise's back.  Why not, though?  That should be the definition.  If everyone else has a dumb definition, that's my definition.  All right.  Did I used to say that?  And we might get Mars.  Oh, look at this.  Someone's saying, Opie, kicking it old school back into the 1300s.  Thank you.  You're really taking it back old school. 
[00:11:30]  I'm hanging out on, what was it, the tortoise shell with the thing?  Yeah, yeah, the tortoise, and it was flat.  The flat thing on the tortoise shell.  And you walked around on Earth, but if you went over the edge, there were sea monsters around the edge.  Yeah.  But if you made it to the edge, you would fall right off.  Why were they scared to, why wouldn't you at least walk to the edge to check out the monsters?  I never understood that as an oldie-time person.  Because they were stupid, because they never got to the edge.  But they were too scared to.  No, they kept going.  Oh, they did?  Yeah, yeah, they kept going.  They assumed at some point they'd reach the edge, because it's right there. 
[00:12:00]  If you look, you could see the edge.  They couldn't fathom that we were on a sphere.  How the fuck are we even alive with our ancestors thinking this shit?  So they kept going.  They'll go, look, the edge, it's right there.  We've got to be getting closer to it.  There's a Kumia, a Hughes, and a Norton that go way the fuck back that really thought this shit was real.  Dumb motherfuckers.  How are we here?  And we pay tribute to them every morning at 6 o'clock here on this program.  It was a Neander Norton, paying for sex while everybody else looked at the fucking edge of the earth. 
[00:12:30]  You're just giving some beaver pelt to some girl she's giving you hers.  This was a major demotion for Pluto.  Astronomers estimate that there are at least 70,000 icy objects with the same composition as Pluto.  It was like affirmative action for one planet.  So Pluto had to go back to the minor leagues or something.  Yeah, Pluto's just another hunk of ice.  So in school they teach that there are eight planets, and they probably mention Pluto like,  look, this guy used to be a big thing. 
[00:13:00]  Let's not hurt his feelings.  Not anymore.  What word did he mispronounce?  Because everyone's all over it.  And it went by all of us.  Oh, shit.  Kuiper?  I don't know what word.  Is it Kuiper?  The Kuiper Belt?  Oh, that's hilarious.  All right, let me go to Greg in the long run.  K-U-I-K-U-I-P-E-R.  Kuiper Belt.  The Kuiper Belt.  Greg, what did he mispronounce?  Okay, it's called a Kuiper Belt.  Kuiper?  The Kuiper Belt.  I'm not a...  Kuiper.  It's K-U-I.  I know, no, you're not a scientist, but you are a dope. 
[00:13:30]  Kuiper Belt.  Kuiper Belt.  That's great.  Nobody corrected me.  We didn't know either.  I'm not going to front.  But at least we didn't say it.  We were not going to front.  But did a lot of people notice it?  Oh, yeah.  I think Kuiper Belt.  All the people that are way smarter than us.  They're all dorks.  Thank you, Greg.  Kuiper Belt.  K-U-I.  Sam's red.  You're a little red.  And Josh.  Oh, Kuiper.  Sam looks like Kuiper. 
[00:14:00]  No, it doesn't.  People are saying you should take the strap-on belt,  because of that one.  You got that whole belt wrong.  See?  The Kuiper.  Well, I say from now on, that is what we call it.  Thank you.  The Kuiper.  You can answer my question.  How many planets are out there now?  I guess eight planets in our solar system.  In the solar system.  They found 50 new ones or something.  And there's a fuckload everywhere.  So when we were learning science,  it was a complete waste of time when we were growing up, right?  Just a Pluto stuff.  I don't know. 
[00:14:30]  I would say it's a waste of time.  Just a Pluto stuff.  That's the whole thing.  You got to start from scratch.  Yeah, because what else did they get wrong?  That's true.  I mean, if they got that wrong, now it sucks.  Well, they found more moons.  They found more moons around, like, Jupiter and Saturn.  Sure.  Some of the gas giants, we call them.  That's what I call Jimmy,  after he eats too many of his egg whites.  Oh, boy, he's a gas giant.  He's a gas giant.  Yeah, and his moons all over the house.  You guys want to watch a video  about why Pluto's not planet anymore?  No.  I'd rather watch a video of you saying Kuiper belt  while you're being raped.  Why raped?  Wait, unless it was made in the fucking 50s. 
[00:15:00]  Go back.  Is that me and Ant as cartoon characters  explaining Pluto?  Are we explaining?  Let's see what they did.  Wait, where's the...  That's my 1997 haircut.  That's an AAF.  And that's Anthony with pulled back ponytail.  With his new look.  No musty.  You want to listen to this?  Sam, after this,  there's a video online  of a fucking black hole.  Let me tell you what this black hole is doing.  Oh, yeah, you got it.  It is sucking up a fucking star on a planet, man.  Could you find it? 
[00:15:30]  Yeah, I'll find it.  We'll listen to some NPR after that.  All right, here we go.  Ask an astronomer.  Ask a gay astronomer.  No kidding.  Pink shirt.  Why isn't Pluto a planet anymore?  Ew.  What is that?  When we ask the question of what is and isn't a planet,  we're really just talking about how the planets work.  I know how he got his last name, yeah.  Ow.  In ancient times, we didn't really need a definition.  What happened?  Astronomers noticed five star-like objects.  Those people like that, Sam.  Mercury, Venus, Mars, Jupiter, and Saturn 
[00:16:00]  that didn't move around with the other stars  but seemed to wander through the sky.  Amazing.  The word planet comes from an ancient Greek word  that meant wanderer.  Fisting up the ass.  Eventually, we figured out that the Earth is a planet, too,  orbiting around the sun just like the others.  And that was pretty much it for the solar system  until the age of telescopes.  Stupid telescope.  The next planet to be discovered was Uranus in 1791.  Uranus.  Uranus.  Hold on.  Pause this.  Love how he...  He's the one guy that should be pronouncing it correctly.  Uranus.  Uranus. 
[00:16:30]  Yes.  It's a low...  Is the scientific community calling it Uranus now?  Yeah.  Was it always Uranus?  No.  And we were just assholes in third grade?  It was Uranus for many years.  For a long time.  Until the anus became a fun place to put your weenie and your tongue.  That's right.  And your fingers.  And the coulee hole.  You think the scientific community just got fucking fed up with everyone  and their dumb Uranus jokes?  Yeah, yeah.  Uranus jokes.  Let's get together and pronounce this differently.  And then once Star Trek came out, it was...  Yeah. 
[00:17:00]  The Klingons are around Uranus.  And that got all...  Ooh.  And then Sulu, Uranus.  We get it.  What is a Klingon around Uranus, you think?  Is it like a little dingleberry?  Yeah, that's a dingleberry.  Or a violent alien race in our solar system.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Which would be much more terrifying.  Of course.  All scopes.  The next planet to be discovered was Uranus in 1781.  Uranus.  Followed by Neptune in 1846.  1846.  These planets are huge, but just too far away for ancient astronomers to see. 
[00:17:30]  Ah.  But did you know that in 1801, astronomer Giuseppe Piazzi discovered another planet?  Yeah.  Or so he thought.  Oh, boy.  This dumb Dago.  He also found a spherical body.  Great.  He's fucking Italian.  Oh, look.  I see the planet.  There it ain't.  Wait.  Mamma mia.  It looks like a pizza into the sky.  I tried to meet the ball of floating.  I'm so sad.  I thought it was a pizza pie.  Just a piece of a pepperoni.  Mamma mia. 
[00:18:00]  Oh, my own.  Another planet.  Oh.  Hey.  Oh.  Ruined my solar system.  No, go back and get some gravity.  Yeah.  If you look up there, there's a ninth planet.  I don't know.  You need another planet?  Okay.  Be careful.  We fucked up there with this a-planet thing, Frankie.  Oh, yeah.  Fuck you.  On a spherical body, about 600 miles across, orbiting between Mars and Jupiter. 
[00:18:30]  I popped your fucking eye out for Pluto!  Do my fucking favor.  Which is smaller than our moon, it was called Ceres.  So, could you pause that before I give you a kiss on the lips?  Did Pluto revolve around Uranus?  Did Pluto revolve around Uranus?  What?  I mean, all right.  Oh, look.  It was called Ceres.  In this case, it wasn't too distant to see, but too small. 
[00:19:00]  Oh.  Uh-oh.  The problem, however, was that Ceres had buddies.  Ceres?  Lots of them.  Oh.  The very next year, a smaller object named Pallas was discovered.  Pallas?  And two years after that, another named Juno.  What?  We now know about thousands of similar bodies.  Oh, boy.  Instead of adding thousands of new planets to the solar system,  astronomers decided it made more sense to group these objects together.  No, they got lazy.  Yeah.  Just like we have with radio.  Name them.  They decided to make it easy for themselves.  Yeah. 
[00:19:30]  Why just, they should name those planets, no?  Uh, no.  They look like a bunch of meatballs in that video.  Yeah.  Like that Swedish meatball.  Little doodies.  Little doodies.  It does.  It looks like those ploppity-plop doodies that make water splash in your coolie.  Well, you don't have enough water, and your shit is breaking off in, like, little solid balls.  It looks like rabbit doodies.  Is that what that's from?  Not enough water?  I'm plop, plop, plop, plop, plop, plop, plop.  Technically, if you don't have enough in your, there's going to be a little bit of fluid buildup, 
[00:20:00]  and the lack of fluid is going to cause them to be a solid matter.  It sounds like some kid dumping a bunch of Aggies into a solid ball.  Are we really going to listen to this whole fucking video?  Well, I want to know what happened to these things that I thought were planets.  Me too.  I think we could speculate that they, instead of making them all planets, they just threw out Pluto.  Right.  So you're out.  Sorry.  Pluto!  Louis Pluto! 
[00:20:30]  Sorry, Pluto, you're out.  The Pluto thing could win it either way.  Maybe I could help.  Maybe I could help.  Fuck Pluto.  We're done with Pluto.  In my solar system, where Uranus and Neptune play with their moons.  Mike, you don't come to the planetarium and talk to a little ball of ice like Pluto like that! 
[00:21:00]  It's a disaster.  Not one E-Rock joke today?  Oh!  That is good.  Planetary.  How is a planet?  Well, the problem is, this is a small planet, so it's very hard to make an E-Rock joke.  And the hunks of ice, not shit.  I don't mean that.  Oh, gee.  Don't mean it.  Boy, you sure took around.  You went around the back door to that one, didn't you?  I don't mean it.  Oh, poor E-Rock.  Oh, boy, yeah.  Do you want to listen to the rest of this?  Yeah, I really don't care.  Not good.  Not fun by me.  I learned enough right there.  How about another 30 seconds?  I think so. 
[00:21:30]  I love these guys.  The Coochie Coo Belt and the...  All right, so there's thousands of things that look like Pluto.  Is that where we're at?  Yeah.  Okay.  So in school, they're teaching eight planets.  Eight planets.  And a bunch of blocks of fucking ice.  That don't matter.  It's worth the shit.  If I was a science teacher, I'd now laugh now.  I would make my students fucking memorize all thousand of these things.  All thousand of the names of that by tomorrow.  Right.  And then have a pop quiz.  On a report on each one.  Separate.  Right. 
[00:22:00]  Yeah, a book report on each one.  I don't know.  I'm still going old school with nine planets.  I still consider Pluto a planet.  Well, the scientific community scoffs at you.  Well, let them scoff.  Yeah, whatever, man.  I don't give a shit.  That's how I was brought up.  You can't just make your own rules.  Well, I'm also brought up with two different water fountains.  Sam, if we acknowledge that there's only eight now, that means everything we learned  in school is wrong.  Right.  And that it was a waste of time.  Right.  In our world, it's nine planets.  The Matrix fucked up.  Always.  Oh, no.  The Matrix fucked up. 
[00:22:30]  By the way, Nathan Brimmer writes on his Twitter, is it finally time?  Oh, wait.  No.  He was going to get credit for something.  Ah, fuck it.  You got your name out.  Oh, no.  He did say this.  What other things did we get wrong in history?  Oh.  Well, there's a lot of revisionist history going on these days, but as far as getting  completely wrong, yeah, I'd like to know.  Seems like astronomy's all fucked up.  That they didn't even fix until, what did they say, 2004, 2006, something like that?  2006.  2006.  So that's a long time to keep fucking something up.  But that's a good question. 
[00:23:00]  We used to think nine planets, now eight.  Anything else?  It's got to be the obvious stuff, not the fucking gray area shit, stuff that we thought  was...  We absolutely thought there was going to be Martians and life on Mars, I think.  I bet kids weren't taught that.  Why were we taught that?  I don't know.  I don't remember being taught that.  I bet.  Yeah.  You know what you got to do is find...  We thought there were rivers on Mars.  This is going to be a tough project for you today.  Okay.  A video from the 50s talking about the universe. 
[00:23:30]  The solar system.  That's what I want to hear.  Here's our solar system!  They all yelled.  Here it is!  That's just because the mic sucked.  Yeah, yeah.  The guy couldn't hear himself.  His headphones sucked.  Yeah.  Mars' great-grandfather's sitting there trying to fix it.  I don't know.  By throwing water on it, huh?  Yeah, there's a good...  It cleans it out.  They learn different.  A 50s solar system... 
[00:24:00]  Or something.  50s...  Educational...  We'll go early 60s, even.  Let's see.  What we got?  What we got?  Uh-huh.  Uh-huh.  Oh, boy.  Oh, look at this.  Why is Howard the second one in?  What?  I don't know.  Howard is there.  He invented everything.  We could watch a 50s film about if an atomic bomb explodes.  I remember those.  Duck and cover, Johnny.  Good boy.  Yeah, because your desk is going to save you.  Yeah.  Stupid.  Let's look at this. 
[00:24:30]  What is this?  No promises.  A brief history of science.  No, this looks too new.  Maybe it's just a new intro.  I like the song.  Well, how about you fast forward?  I like...  Click right there.  Keep clicking.  It sucks.  It's not it.  Oh, Sam.  Sam.  Sam.  Sam.  Sam.  I said...  Stinky.  I said no promises.  No, you can't just say no promises.  Then you can say no promises about everything.  Like Cooper.  Right.  Just like you did with your fucking prep sheet, which I'm not letting go.  What?  By the way, have you noticed something about the prep sheet?  What's wrong with the prep sheet? 
[00:25:00]  It's like he's a lawyer.  He puts something in there that fucking makes it so he can disavow any knowledge of his actions.  What are you talking about?  Look at what it says.  Remember when this shit used to, uh, uh...  Be really good?  Yeah, really good.  No, when it would fuck up and we'd be like...  We'd ask a guest a question and they'd be like, who wrote this shit?  Notice the last two things and you tell me what defense...  Oh, you know what?  That really sickens me.  It sickens me.  There's a defense now on here. 
[00:25:30]  A loophole.  It is...  You're doing the prep sheet version of allegedly.  Right.  Yeah, well, I'm not asking the man himself.  John Amos is going to be on our show today at 8.30 this morning.  Don't miss it.  Of course, you remember him as James in good times.  He's been on many...  Coming to America.  Roots.  Uh, just, uh, an icon.  Doing a play.  Uh, here.  He's doing a play.  But, uh, there's two things of information.  It says...  And here it says, he was born in Newark, went to high school in Orange, New Jersey. 
[00:26:00]  Now, there's no preface to that because that's fact.  You know that.  I'm pretty sure.  Now, instead of researching anything, what we get here is...  And we don't get, he was a boxing golden gloves champion.  Right.  We don't get that.  We get, according to the...  Totally puts you in the clear.  If we ask him that and he goes, I was never a golden gloves fucking boxer. 
[00:26:30]  Well, what you do now, instead of saying, you were a golden gloves boxer, right?  Yeah.  And he'd be like, no.  You say, hey, were you a golden gloves boxer?  And that way, if he says no, you could be like, I didn't think so.  Because you know that it's not...  Well, why not pop it into the internet and see if he was?  Cross-reference.  Well, I did, but I mean...  No, no.  I've cross-referenced stuff before that's been wrong.  Like what?  I mean, I don't remember specifically.  But people take something on IMDB and just put it on a hundred websites.  And then also, according to the internet, he was once spotted observing one of the John 
[00:27:00]  Gotti trials.  I mean, it's probably true, but...  You gotta ask him both of these now.  Now...  You find out.  But you left yourself an out because you've been...  You've been criticized before.  Someone was watching him watch something, and that's on the prep sheet?  Yeah.  So someone alleges that you watched something.  Is that true?  And he'll go, yes.  And we'll go, all right.  He gives a shit.  He gives a shit.  Yeah.  I don't have access to them to ask specifically, is this true? 
[00:27:30]  I don't have a pre-interview.  That's not even an important fact to put on the thing.  He was once observed, spotted, observing a Gotti trial.  Oh, look at what...  Don't ask about it.  What's the first man saying here?  According to the internet, the shit hour is popular.  See, now everyone knows that's bullshit.  I would write according to Anthony Cumia.  Ah, he was taken out of context.  He did say it was great.  It was nothing but lies.  He said it was his favorite hour.  Lies.  Well, listen.  Are you finding the 50s astronomy video?  No, I'm defending myself against allegations.  You don't need to defend yourself.  Not allegations.  We're trying to help you.  Yeah. 
[00:28:00]  We're trying to help you stop wrecking the radio show.  Hey, remember we were talking about things that are now wrong, Ant?  Yeah.  We might have another one.  Peter in North Carolina.  Peter.  Spit the pumpkin out first, please.  I get it.  Thank you.  Jesus.  Go ahead, Peter.  Hey, what's going on, guys?  Hi.  Hi.  Well, there is now a fifth ocean.  They call it the Southern Ocean because the Arctic Ocean had its own,  and they believe Antarctica should now have its own. 
[00:28:30]  Wait, we have more oceans now, Ant?  I never heard of that one.  You never heard of it?  Is this official?  Yeah, I'm a teacher in North Carolina.  You can't just give us another ocean.  Hey, they did it.  Punch it out.  Hey, not you.  Hey, Sam.  How about you do this?  1950, and then an S.  Not just 50s.  1950.  Put it in Google.  Google.  Right?  19?  And it is a car in that film, by the way. 
[00:29:00]  1950.  Educational film.  Beautiful.  Educational film.  Nice.  Solar system.  See.  Now hit go.  See, anyone could have done that.  And now go to videos.  Go to videos.  And now look it down there.  See?  Beyond our solar system highlights 1959.  Oh, fuck.  All right.  Let's hear what this motherfucker is.  Ah.  Everyone in school in 1959 learned this.  Beyond our solar system.  M-C-M-L-I-X. 
[00:29:30]  Carnet Institutional Films.  Oh, Henry Otto, PhD.  Suck that cock.  He's now dead.  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.  PhD means nothing.  He's now dead.  The sun is the center of a great system of planets and moons.  Uh-oh.  Of asteroids, comets, and meteors called the solar system.  Yes.  But beyond the solar system lie the stars.  That's us.  Many of these stars seem grouped in certain patterns. 
[00:30:00]  Yeah.  A constellation chart will help us study some nearby groups of stars.  This one looks like a negro.  Yeah.  Looking north.  This one a homosexual.  We can find some familiar constellations.  This is the constellation white girl cowering in fear.  The Little Dipper.  Draco.  Draco.  Cassiopeia.  And Cepheus.  I'd love to hear you pronounce those.  The name of the Big Dipper comes from the fact that its seven main stars seem to outline 
[00:30:30]  a long-handled dipper in the sky.  Do you like the Big Dipper, Sam?  The brightest of all these constellations is...  This is boring.  It's not about the planets and shit.  Yeah, it's constellation.  Yeah.  But look.  That's what you put in, though.  And then you search.  Find things.  Yeah.  Look for one about planets.  Yeah.  One's about the solar system.  Yeah, not the whole solar system.  There's more.  I'm sure there's more on YouTube and stuff.  Hmm.  Korean War.  According to Sixth of the film about... 
[00:31:00]  Oh, that's Beyond Our Social.  What makes a good party?  What?  What makes a good party from 19-what?  1950.  Oh, fuck, yeah.  Pop that on.  Fuck the planets.  I want to hear what makes a good party.  Ah.  What makes a good party?  No Negroes.  Unless they're serving.  Ah.  This is going to be all about how women suck dick and can't fucking put a good party together.  1950s. 
[00:31:30]  1950s.  Hello, I mean.  This is Gene.  I just had a letter from my brother.  And guess what?  He's bringing his roommate home from college.  Oh, his roommate.  Uh-oh.  Oh, shit.  Oh, boy.  Oh, boy.  They're buying a house together.  He's gay.  I'd bang the shit out of that 50s bitch right there.  This is one party that just has to turn out right.  Yeah.  Well, the purpose of a party is to have fun together.  That's right. 
[00:32:00]  And a successful party needs planning and skill.  Certainly does.  And she doesn't have it.  But she has a vagina.  A vagina for gay entertainment.  Gay.  Oh, pause that.  That's what I meant.  Happy.  Yes, I'm available.  I love a good party.  That is a gay environment.  Maybe they were just open back then.  No.  A brother with the roommate.  A party.  A gay party.  Gay time.  The best part of that is visual.  They're showing a gay party.  And there's what seems to be giant salamis hanging. 
[00:32:30]  They're those big balloons that blow up but get long when you blow them up.  So it's a gay party.  Oh, that's the gay entertainment.  What they're saying is while your guests are mingling, you have all the queers go into  the kitchen and fuck each other with salami so they don't bother you.  That's what he's trying to say.  It's 1950.  Of course that's what they're saying.  Get their fun out of the way.  Yes.  Keep all cylindrical objects in the other room so the gays will go sit on them.  Let's hear how gay the party is.  All right.  And for gay entertainment or a game party in a home.  Oh, they're playing fucking ping pong. 
[00:33:00]  A birthday party.  A holiday party.  Yay.  They all take planning and they should all be fun.  It's a kid eating apple.  That's not a kid.  Oh, there's a kid.  That's an adult woman.  It's an adult woman with a witch hat and her hands are behind her back and there's apples  hanging from the ceiling and she's trying to grab them with her.  That party fucking blows.  You wouldn't go to one of these parties?  No.  That's where you want to see a fucking teen rioter shooting.  I got...  Was that me?  Yeah, you did.  I thought it was my headphone.  When I lean on this fucking board and it does knock out mics. 
[00:33:30]  There it is.  Is that it?  There we go.  I'm on.  I'm on the air.  You had some woman in a witch hat at a Halloween party, obviously, and they've tied apples to  strings and she's trying to bite the apple.  But of course, it's on a string.  So, it goes to the left or right as she's trying to get it.  If it was a big gay cock.  And I mean happy and festive.  That's what they mean in the 1950s.  Okay, let's hear what else makes a good party.  I like this.  Loved his old films.  A guy with his head split open.  The party of Jean, Nora, and I leave a party. 
[00:34:00]  What of its purpose?  The man is to receive to the gang.  And show him a wonderful time.  Yeah, show everyone at the time.  That'll sleep over.  Now listen, this is what we have to plan.  A guest list, invitations, refreshments, and entertainment.  All right.  Now, a guest list.  Who will we ask?  No Negroes.  There's three of us on our date.  And I suppose we could have an extra couple and two extra girls for Jim and Steve. 
[00:34:30]  Yes.  Oh, wow.  Well, girls.  Well, that means I'll get two.  Yeah.  Steve, we get the roomie that the guy's bringing home.  Yeah, the salami.  The general salami in the kitchen.  That's pretty cool, though, that the chick's actually thinking, like, there's going to be  two guys there that aren't part of their little fucking couple thing.  And we're going to invite two whores to the party for them.  That is pretty good. 
[00:35:00]  What about refreshments?  I bet there's no booze whatsoever.  Yeah.  Punch?  Yes.  We'll get some punch.  Some pop?  We won't need any grape soda or Cheetos because the Negroes aren't coming.  The 50s pointed.  They hate Negroes.  Let's have Alice and Ted come.  They're nice.  I'd love to go to a party.  Oh, God.  Where's Alice?  Alice.  I would love to go to a party, Anthony.  What about Alice?  Does she want to go?  Oh, Alice is wonderful.  Alice, be tokeless. 
[00:35:30]  Oh, Alice, can you get off work from Mel's restaurant?  I'd love to take you to a party.  But just tell Flo not to come.  She has me laughing the whole evening.  Maybe to serve grits and she could kiss them.  Yes.  Sometimes I'll also put fingers in my backside and I'll say, stow them.  This sounds great.  They're like teen girls.  They're laying on the bed.  They have stuffed animals.  How can you tell they're teenagers?  They're like 40, Anthony.  They could either be 16 or 40. 
[00:36:00]  They're like a Channing hair.  But that was the 50s.  You don't know.  Here's what you do.  If a girl looks...  I bet a lot of guys got in trouble back then.  Yeah.  If a girl looks 30 or 40 in the 50s...  She could be 16 or 17.  No, she was.  She was a teen.  If a girl was actually 30 or 40, she looked like your grandmother.  She probably was dead.  Rule of thumb.  They only lived to about 40 in the 50s.  You could tell she's kind of a teen, though.  Yeah.  How?  Yeah.  Well, she's got kind of an innocent-looking little face or cheeks.  Believe me, I could tell. 
[00:36:30]  With my mom's hairdo.  I notice I'm getting a little filled up.  That's how I know.  That's how she's holding a stuffed animal.  That's true.  I'm a plushie.  Hit it.  Gang, Margie's lots of fun.  The fellows would like her.  Oh!  Margie takes it in the poop room.  Margie, what has she been doing in the 50s?  Three inputs for Margie.  Margie's lots of fun.  The guys would love her.  Like, ooh.  But, you know what?  The innocence of the time.  Oh, I know.  They have no idea that Margie's just sucking cock everywhere. 
[00:37:00]  Margie used a lot of drool.  Sure.  Just fucking yanking those cocks.  Because that shit never changed.  No.  But they're clueless.  They don't know why Margie is a lot of fun.  They think it's because Margie is a beach ball and she likes to bounce it up against the chandelier.  Yes!  Margie's a three-hole McGillicuddy, and they don't know what that means.  But she's so popular.  She's a size queen.  Yeah.  She loves the cock, Margie.  All right.  Back up slightly.  She could queef out Sean on us songs.  That's why they all love her. 
[00:37:30]  Her ass is going out.  Her ass is as big as Bowser's mouth.  Margie does a thing with ping pong balls that she learned in the Philippines.  Everyone loves Margie.  Fucking Margie rules.  What does it mean to gargle with cum?  That's what Margie does.  Yeah, they don't even know what cum is.  They're innocent with their little stuffed animals.  All right.  Let's hear her.  They're nice, and they're usually in our game. 
[00:38:00]  Margie's lots of fun.  The fellas would like her.  Oh, yeah.  That's right, Eileen.  And let's ask Dot.  We certainly had a wonderful time at her party last month.  Oh, I'll say.  Dot, that's their Indian friend.  All of them being together.  But has anyone left out?  I don't think so.  Leave anyone out.  Well, that's our guest list.  Now, invitations.  Invitations.  Should we write?  Dear Alice, would you like to come to a party at my house?  Saturday, March 24th. 
[00:38:30]  Just fucking send an e-vite, you dumb cunt.  Why don't you call on our cell phones that don't exist for 62 years?  Why don't we write a letter and invite someone to this party?  Boy, this time sucks.  I'll send the email.  Oh, that's right.  They're just stupid.  The cell phone was just waiting to be invented.  Fucking invent the damn thing, you dummies.  They still were barely dialing a telephone.  Yeah.  Number, please.  Number, please.  I watched a little movie on how they told people from AT&T how to dial a phone. 
[00:39:00]  And it's actually a woman saying, like, instead of picking up your handset and asking the operator  to connect you with a number, you dial the phone.  Oh, wow.  And she's the same voice that they still use today.  It's like, if you'd like to make a call, please hang up.  It's the same fucking woman.  They're still using her voice.  Why?  I don't know.  Update that shit.  And they had to explain, like, this is the dial tone.  Man.  It's a steady tone that you'll hear. 
[00:39:30]  And a busy signal.  And this is the thing that means the thing's been off the hook too long.  He did that one.  But dialing, that's right.  You know what?  Dialing somebody else meant no one could listen in on your conversations.  Yeah.  You and fucking sexual conversations are texting each other.  Oh, yeah.  When you could pick up the phone and just call Margie the fucking hole.  Margie.  Do you know how much that must...  The guys were probably jerking off like animals on the phone.  Let me tell you something, Margie.  Because there was no fucking operator listening. 
[00:40:00]  No.  No, they could just fucking...  They would listen to everything, too, wouldn't they?  I had a party line when I was a kid.  Yeah?  Yeah, I remember that party line where...  You know what it was called?  Yeah, that was like when a bunch of people shared the wire.  You'd share a number, right?  Yeah, you'd share like a number and you'd lift up your phone and make a call and you'd hear  people talking.  Yeah.  What kind of invasion of privacy is that?  And you couldn't...  Could you hang up, please?  Oh, sorry.  I've been on the phone.  Yeah.  I got an emergency.  Remember emergency breakthroughs? 
[00:40:30]  Yeah.  Yeah, they used to do that.  Emergency breakthrough.  But they'd really grill you about it.  They wouldn't just do it right away.  You'd have to call the operator and go, yeah, the line's been busy for an hour.  I have an emergency breakthrough.  And then the operator would just pop on the guy's call and go like, there's an emergency  breakthrough.  And then they'd hang up and you'd be like, what are you doing tonight?  Yeah, when your girlfriend was fighting.  You got any weed?  The phone was off the hook.  That was the worst when you tried an emergency breakthrough, but they weren't actually on  the phone.  It was just off the hook.  Yeah.  They didn't want to talk to you anymore.  The hook.  Yeah, the busy signal sucked, especially the ones that went on for hours on end. 
[00:41:00]  What the fuck are you doing?  It finally rang and you're like, you'd be mad at the person.  Fuck you on the phone so long.  Hey, fuck you.  My phone?  No one does that anymore.  Let's hit this.  Fuck, write a letter to invite to a party.  Yes.  Yeah, let's learn more about what makes it good.  party in 1960.  Margie, make sure you bring your giant vagina and ample asshole.  But look at how awful her fucking letter is.  Oh, yeah.  This party is fucking, welcome to snooze city. 
[00:41:30]  Dollsville.  Yeah.  Dear Steve, Gary, Scott, and the rest of management, would you like to come to a party?  Oh, God.  That's a terrible letter.  Handwritten.  She's got a lick of stamps and envelopes.  From Bob Eatman.  Did you get a handwrite each one, too, back then?  Yeah, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Get the fuck out of here.  We could find a mimeograph machine, but yes.  I think that was at the skewle.  Yeah, hit it.  Let's hear.  They didn't have Asians around back then.  Those people take those type of jobs. 
[00:42:00]  This is a white party.  Believe me, if they show this party, it's going to be the whitest-ass fucking party you've ever  done soon.  Party rules.  I know.  I want to go.  At 8 p.m. and so on.  Why bother to write?  This is just an informal party.  Let's just phone everyone.  Sure.  Good.  We'll phone tomorrow.  Oh.  Next business, refreshments.  Uh-oh.  Let's listen.  We have to feed the men.  And the girls, too.  How about mouthfuls of pussy?  Yeah.  We have to feed the men. 
[00:42:30]  That's right, bitches.  Get in the kitchen and start rattling some pots and pans.  And when you're done, get in the bedroom and spread them.  I loved the 50s.  And we've got to get some stakes for our eyes in case we get punched.  In case we say something out of turn.  Like how cute Sammy Davis Jr. is.  Go backwards.  Do you believe that twat was going to write letters when they had phones?  Yeah, they had a phone.  Okay.  Yeah, just phone them.  Well, the phone was so new, she was probably like, oh, yeah, that thing. 
[00:43:00]  Yeah.  Maybe we can think about it.  Let's go to their house and hand them the phone and tell them, hey, stupid, pick it up.  Hit the buttons, cunt.  Idiot.  Hit it.  We have to feed the men.  And the girls, too.  Especially you.  Gee, thanks.  Does it show?  Yes.  Well, we want something to eat and something to drink.  Refreshments.  How about hot chocolate and sandwiches?  I'll fix the sandwiches.  Well, thanks, Eileen.  Suppose I talk.  Hot chocolate and sandwiches. 
[00:43:30]  Ah, this party stinks.  And then this is what makes a good one?  And then the bread can stick to everybody's mouth and they'll all have bad bread breath.  No kidding.  What's worse than bread breath?  All the men's breath will smell like Margie anyway.  What the fuck?  Hot chocolate and sandwiches for a party.  That's horrible.  That stinks.  Tomorrow we'll have hot chocolate and sandwiches.  Sandwiches.  What a dull fucking party this is.  This stinks.  We're at my party.  Don't get nervous. 
[00:44:00]  Don't get nervous.  Hey, why don't you get them a hot chocolate?  The hot chocolates are on the house.  More hot chocolates.  Sandwiches.  I'll fix the sandwiches.  Well, thanks, Eileen.  Suppose I talk it over with Mother and get her suggestions.  Mother.  All right.  All right.  Now, next is entertainment.  Oh.  We want to show Steve a good time, but, well, we don't know too much about what he likes.  Oh.  Yes.  A lot more men.  Fat cock.  A couple of men. 
[00:44:30]  Cuban men dancing.  Yes.  Unclipped dicks.  A lot of hair.  Yeah.  Big bears.  We don't know what Steve likes.  Every time he looks at a vagina, he runs to the sink and wretches.  And it is so innocent.  It's like everyone listening to this would make the joke, like, oh, what is Steve like?  Yeah.  Steve would like to put it in your face, you dumb bitch.  But they obviously don't know.  Yeah.  We don't know what Steve likes.  He just sits in meetings and makes a weird Jughead face. 
[00:45:00]  Oh, shit.  You went with another Steve there.  The brilliance of Jim Norton.  Sandwiches is from Goodfellas.  When they're in the prison scene.  Yes.  Thank you.  I just want to clear that up for people.  Well, we don't know too much about what he likes.  The best thing I know for breaking the ice and getting people acquainted is some good  mixer games.  Oh.  Oh, but they can be such a bore if you don't have good ones.  Like this whole party?  Well, let's go to the library and get some good magazines and books. 
[00:45:30]  We'll find some really good games.  The library?  Oh, good.  And this party can just be an informal, get acquainted sort of party, and we'll have games  for entertainment.  Well, there are still many details to be planned.  These bitches don't know shit.  But the basic things are settled.  Okay.  Guest list, invitations, refreshments.  What is Steve like, though?  Where the fuck would they show this, by the way?  We're watching on the internet.  These would be in schools.  They would show them in schools.  Why in school?  Because they wanted to teach the women folk how to throw a party. 
[00:46:00]  How to behave properly.  And then there would be films for guys, like, you know, hygiene, wash your dick, things  like that.  So you could get into fucking Margie.  When Patty was your...  Patty would watch this and agree with it.  Yes.  Oh, that's good.  A guest list works.  That's good for number one invitations.  I don't have any friends, so it's zero.  My phone isn't paid for, so I can't cool people.  So, refreshments, I'm broke.  Some Starbucks. 
[00:46:30]  I'll give them coffee, and then we can eat coffee grounds.  Entertainments, I'll put on the overnight show.  Creep.  Enough with her.  All these things should be planned to fit together well.  Yeah.  Like Margie in a conch.  It's the big night.  Oh!  The planning and preparation will help make a good party.  This is just like a compound party.  What else makes a good party?  Oh, pause.  Make sure there are lots of racial epithets. 
[00:47:00]  And drink until it's uncomfortable for everyone around you.  Leave Jell-O shot containers everywhere,  so you're trotting upon them for three or four days.  Take liquor and spill it all over the soundboard in clumsy fashion.  Go downstairs and sing some songs that are not appropriate for the adults to hear,  as you just keep drinking and drinking more whiskey.  You'll have a great time at your party at the compound. 
[00:47:30]  Let's see how our party goes.  Not one black person.  It's the skill of the hosts and the skill of the guests in making the party fun for everyone.  What's that skill?  Oh, boy.  They'll show up at the same time.  What?  First getting everyone acquainted and into the spirit of the party.  How's it done?  Come in here, Steve.  We'll wait here for the girls to put their coats away.  Welcome to the party, Chip. 
[00:48:00]  Ted's in the other room.  Since this party's so much fun, I had punch, but where's the sock-em?  I like the sultry voice that one woman had there.  Why don't you come in here?  She just got done smoking 18 Pall Malls, and it's fucking 8 in the morning.  It's your stinky cigarette breath and fucking coffee.  You know the whole house just reeks of cigarettes.  It's tar and nicotine dripping down the walls. 
[00:48:30]  The carter breath.  Oh, it's horrible.  Well, Steve, what do you think of our game?  What you've met of the mining?  Oh, there's swell.  But what's this about me being the guest of honor?  Oh, that's Gene's way of keeping you quiet.  Oh, boy.  Margie and Dottie were just thrilled to think you college men would call for them.  Oh, a couple of campus bigwigs we are.  You bet your life.  Oh, I think our guests are right.  I hope they're men.  Boy, these two.  Are they hiding something?  Yeah, they're big wigs already because their heads are so big you can't wear a small wig. 
[00:49:00]  Exactly.  I'm doing good at this party.  This is huge.  Everybody likes me.  Let me see.  What do you think?  Race.  Race of the person that just rang the bell that's ready to open the door.  Why are we even doing this?  All right.  White.  So obviously white.  Do you think there'll be one black couple that comes in?  No, no.  Maybe.  You know what?  No.  And then they'll just stop it.  They'll stop it like freeze frame and go, now there's a problem.  Yes.  Make sure to nail down all of your possessions before these animals come in and steal everything.  Holy shit.  They won't put it back. 
[00:49:30]  Jeez.  They didn't have any of this.  There will be no black friends.  Of course not.  There is no integration.  They will be as white and dumb looking.  They're all wearing suits, ties, and jackets.  So uncomfortable.  Yes.  Especially for a party.  A party or a fucking business meeting.  This stinks.  Well, it's a fun party because they're going to have fucking sandwiches and hot chocolate  and suits.  Yeah.  And play some fucking party games that they got from the library.  Yeah.  All right.  Let's see what happens.  Pin the cock on Margie.  I'm fucking obsessed with this now. 
[00:50:00]  Sorry, Ryan.  Excuse me.  More guests.  I hope you like our friends, Steve.  Well, I hope they'll like me.  They will.  They will.  Oh, the bitches are here.  Hello.  Hi.  Are we the friends right here?  Oh, no.  Margie and Dottie are here.  Oh, hi, Gina.  How you been?  Hello, Paul.  I'm so glad you're here.  Hi.  Paul fucking tend to get that shit.  They're all here.  Steve.  This party's great.  Where's the hot cocoa? 
[00:50:30]  It's amazing.  I love sandwiches.  You got any penis sputter and jelly and some hot cocoa?  You're making them laugh.  See?  You'd be cracking Margie up.  I ain't being funny.  I got to go in there and check on the youngsters while you're out here at the party.  I'm 22 years young.  Oh, that's it, right?  It's 1950.  He's still a creep.  He's a college creep.  I'm going to go in college, even though he's 22.  He wasn't an uncle yet. 
[00:51:00]  He was just Paul.  Hi, I'm Paul.  I'm going to go in there and fix the crib.  Oh, that Paul's so helpful.  Always wanting to help out with things having to do with the children.  Where's that big stuffed panda you were holding?  I bet you I could put something under there.  It looks like a tail.  Make the little one grab it with her hand.  Little baby hand around it.  Oh, shit.  It looks so big.  And, of course, no one notices or cares because it's the 50s.  Oh, look.  Paul is bouncing the toddler on his leg, making a third leg. 
[00:51:30]  Yay!  Oh, that Paul.  He loves the kids.  Yeah.  Eileen, this is Steve.  Hello, Steve.  Hello, Eileen.  Aren't you the party planner I've heard so much about?  Well, and this is Paula Thompson, our star tackle.  Hey, this is Steve.  Let me take your coat.  This is how Jean helps her guests get acquainted.  Where's Margie?  Well, the party is off to a good start.  What?  I just walked in.  Yeah.  They're hanging out in the foyer.  Yeah.  And to help others fun.  Okay.  And when all the guests have arrived and have been introduced, the games begin. 
[00:52:00]  Oh, well-planned, well-chosen games.  Oh, no.  What the fun games?  How come nobody will play my game?  What game is that?  What's your game, Paul?  Find the presents in the diapers.  Where everybody has ten minutes in the closet with the youngster to find things in their diapers.  It's a fun game.  It sounds hilarious.  Everybody hide and seek, but I'll be in the crib, and you can't come in without notifying me. 
[00:52:30]  Not even the star tackle?  He's a star tackle.  The star tackle.  They had to bring that up.  They were all in their suits and dresses, and now the party game is starting.  I see some props.  This woman's bringing out, like, these string things.  I don't know what kind of game this is going to be.  Some kind of dangling thing.  Are they like romper-stompers?  I don't know.  We'll find out here.  Let's get this going here.  Each one may ask questions and try to guess his own identity. 
[00:53:00]  Okay, hold the phone.  What they're doing is they're pairing off.  Guys and girls are pairing off, and they've got these strings tied around their neck and a tag on it with, I guess, a popular person of the time or history written on it.  And then they sling it around behind them so the person asking them questions can't see what the name is.  And then you ask them questions to try to find out who the person is before the other person does. 
[00:53:30]  Why can't they just mingle?  What a fun party game.  Just fucking mingle and talk.  I'm going to do that at the compound, but every answer will be Adolf Hitler.  Yeah.  Or fucking Pol Pot.  Really awful people.  Stalin.  What a terrible party.  Horrible.  Let's see how it goes.  Ted Kaczynski.  This mixes the group well, and besides, it provides a means of choosing partners for the next game.  Oh, fucking.  Having fun together makes a party.  Yeah.  This means both hosts and guests. 
[00:54:00]  What are they reading?  This party sucks.  Someone's reading and they're writing notes.  Whenever any of the guests begin to lose interest in a game, the host should start a new game so fun together can continue.  What?  What if someone else is...  Of course, the guests have a part in this, too.  Oh.  I'm bored.  Each one should try to make the games fun.  Each should take part in what the group is doing.  Oh, by the way, right now, right now, one of the guests is a little bit tipsy and he's taking a shit on the glass table.  And Margie's underneath it. 
[00:54:30]  Yeah.  They're all trying to guess.  They're all trying to guess who Joe DiMaggio is the answer.  And he's dropping a fucking four-foot deuce on a fucking coffee table.  Laying a giant duck down on the fucking table.  Oh, he's doing what I used to do.  He's putting cat shit in the newspaper so that the father comes home and opens the newspaper and cat shit falls on him.  Oh, those darn kids.  Hey, Ted, let's throw hot oil on him.  Oh, fuck. 
[00:55:00]  And if some guests forget this...  No music?  Well, anyone, even another guest, can help get the entire group together again.  Oh, Nora, Jim started that hat-making contest.  Did you like so much?  A hat-making contest?  Oh, what?  No, here's what happened.  Jim got caught with his face in fucking a pair of panties in the bedroom.  Like, what are you doing?  He's like, oh, it's time for the hat-making contest.  I'm making a hat.  Oh, what a fucking game that is. 
[00:55:30]  I'm making a hat.  And it's from the laundry, so there's, like, period blood in it because you didn't have tampons.  There's a big red stain in the middle of your hat, Jim.  Looked like a fucking poster from the Declaration of Independence.  She's got to use her mom's modess, and it just, the blood trickles over the side and makes it all red.  It's a hat-making contest.  Oh, God.  Holy shit.  Is that her panties or a Japanese flag on your head?  Oh, look, Steve puts his head under her skirt. 
[00:56:00]  Look, you're my hat.  And then he licks her vagina and spits out her 1950s hair.  The star tackles hat is a Roman war helmet.  And this is why there are no Negroes.  They would remove the hats and ruin everybody's fun.  Hat-making contest.  Oh, hat-making contest.  Who the fuck?  It sucks.  It's horrible.  Let's see what they make the hats of.  Please go back.  I just want to hear that again.  Yes, yeah.  Because she's so excited. 
[00:56:30]  Oh, she is.  Oh, Sam.  Oh, Sam doesn't know how far back it is.  Fire group together again.  No, Jim started that hat-making contest.  If you like so much, come on.  Come on.  Guys like, huh, when in the end, we're going to give the prize, the best hat.  All right, here are your materials.  A hat-making contest.  He hands out anvils.  Here's your material.  Here's your materials.  A fucking shotgun.  Thumbtacks and hammers. 
[00:57:00]  The worst things for hat-making possible.  Here, I'll take the boulder.  Here's some scalding liquid.  Fucking alligator clips.  This is terrible.  All right, wait a minute.  You got to go back a little.  Because something was said there.  What?  What was said?  Just here's your materials.  Yeah, here's your materials, I think.  And in the end, we're going to give the prize, the best hat.  All right, here are your materials.  A hat-making contest? 
[00:57:30]  Well, this will reveal some talent.  The party is going well again.  No, it's not.  Have you noticed some of the skills of the guests that help keep the party fun for all?  No.  Let's look for others.  While everyone's making a hat, Steve is going through their purses in the coat room to support his methamphetamine habit.  Steve is doing what Led Zeppelin's drummer used to do, and he's shitting into the handbags.  Look at these awful hats.  They call me hats out of fucking flat or toilet paper. 
[00:58:00]  They're terrible.  Who has the reefers?  He's handing out materials.  He gives one lady bed bugs.  One lady toilet paper.  Fucking horrible hats.  They're making hats.  All right.  All right.  Let's see what the guys has.  Yeah.  Ah, they're showing off their hats.  Professional hats.  Oh, the guys don't have to make hats.  Nah, just the braids.  He's holding up a giant mirror.  Yeah.  Oh, boy.  Make a hat, stupid.  Yeah. 
[00:58:30]  We'll invent computers.  Make a hat.  They would post this on Twitter.  But, well.  What?  Ah.  First prize goes to the college puke, I think.  Why?  What was the prize?  Because his bitch had the best hat.  What did they get?  Did you ever play rhythm?  What?  Oh, boy.  Rhythm.  Oh, no.  Oh, boy.  This is the way they could use a black guy.  And by the way, they pause right now, and it says four hours later, and they're all just  trying to coordinate clapping.  What's the thing?  They're, like, clapping their hands and clapping on their thighs.  This is what went on at parties back then? 
[00:59:00]  Stupid O-Face.  Ah.  Terrible fucking party.  Terrible.  The rhythm.  Let her rip the rhythm.  Uh-oh.  Let me show you how that's done.  Yeah.  How'd you get laid back then?  It was impossible.  Terrible.  It was a whole schedule.  Yeah.  They never just tear it off?  No.  One, three.  Three, two.  Two, seven.  Seven, two.  Oh, look.  You're out.  And then they get up, and they brain her with a lamp.  That's what happens if you clap wrong. 
[00:59:30]  Somebody gets up and takes a lamp and caves your fucking head in like the Night Stalker.  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.  How great is that?  Margie is now a crumpled pile of what could have been in the fucking corner.  her rainer  her matted hair is on the bottom of the lamp  this will have to be covered up  we don't have DNA  so all you have to do is say  wasn't me  they had seen a negro in the neighborhood 
[01:00:00]  earlier that evening  or how about charades  ah what is that one  oh look what she's doing  he's got like a  he's running and it makes it look like he has a gun  and then he's putting on a nurse hat  and he's pretending he's falling  he's like I'm Richard Speck  oh fuck 
[01:00:30]  we really have a good one  oh we have a good one  at just the right moment  a fire breaks out  and everyone is killed  thank god for faulty wiring  the only way to end this party right  is skin grafts for everyone  and then they have a contest  who can make the most convincing face mask  those hats are actually more convincing wigs than most burn victims have 
[01:01:00]  thank god they didn't know about flame retardant material  you know one chair burning could take out a whole block with toxic fuel  yes  Steve flicked an ash on Margie's back  let's hear  is anybody hungry  oh  well a little snack certainly is pleasant about this time of evening  the neighbor Eric has walked in 
[01:01:30]  and said  I am  a guest is late to the party  as usual  he heard the word hungry  and he walked in and made a meat martini  no one's ever heard of this  but even in this time  they know it's unhealthy  and these are people who eat cigarettes  there isn't one cholesterol count under 600 in the room  let's see what they're eating  simple food  arm and arm 
[01:02:00]  an informal way to serve refreshments  each one can serve himself  and help the others too  what  is she a cripple  I put my cock through the vial on a plate  and a hot dog  a little more spontaneous  on plan five  you're just holding it at waist height  here have mine  with that rule back in the 50s  do you know what is creepy  they would think you are  horrified 
[01:02:30]  especially  you said it wasn't you  but then they look at the front of your suit pants  and there's hot dog crumb against it  and they know that she was telling the truth  he made a hot dog penis  he has to leave the party  he does that every time  that's rude  he's a Mr. Bungle  one time he defecated  between two pieces of Pepperidge Farm White  and Bill D'Angelo  watched a car run over it  and while everyone finishes eating 
[01:03:00]  a little more spontaneous  unplanned fun  it's called a Mickey  and you put it in the drinks  of one of the girls  who's been behaving flirtatiously  and then everyone  puts their penises inside of her  and when she gets pregnant  you kick her in the stomach  and that's how this party ends  there's no such thing  as date rape  in 1950  you don't want to marry this pig  do you  she made a terrible hat  he's as good as Liberace 
[01:03:30]  in more ways than one  the pendulum swinging  the other way  oh my god  Jimmy cracked a fart  and everyone cares  Jimmy cracked a fart  and everyone cares  this is good stuff  Jimmy cracked a fart  and cleared the room  worth that Jimmy

[01:19:00]  the sports media  Brady threw  for 517 yards  last night  Still bringing it  Four TDs  It literally  looked like  the ball  was being  shot out  of a cannon  and flying  so far  down the field  It was ridiculous  He's a fucking  monster  It was ridiculous  I think it was  the fifth  best game  by a quarterback  ever  as far as  yards go  I think  Yeah I think  you're right  And I think  the two guys  there last night  set the NFL  single game record  total of 906 
[01:19:30]  yards  Oh  Passing  last night  How are his  follicles  grown in  Oh they're doing  alright man  They're not  showing him  right there  They're kind  of cutting  off the top  of his head  a little  on the video  Maybe that's  part of his  contractual agreement  He can't be  videoed above  his forehead  until all of  his follicles  grow in  Is he getting  hair?  I thought he  went  There were rumors  that he had  gone to  Bosley  to get some  follicles  Tom Bosley? 
[01:20:00]  Taken from  the harvest  region  to fill in  some spots  Congrats to  everyone that  has Brady  on their  fantasy football  Okay there's  Brady  That's Brady  from when?  That haircut  is hot  2010  He's looking  a little  2010 he  already started  doing the  hair follicles  You sure  that's 2010?  The hair follicle  story is a little  old now  Then you got  the moppy head  How the fuck  did he get  all that hair? 
[01:20:30]  I don't know  Do you know  the torture?  He must be  going through  a good looking  quarterback  Super Bowl  and fucking  just having  his hair  fucking leap  out  Start losing  your hair  Pulls his  helmet off  and there's  a fucking  fribble in  it  Good  Ah shit  Oh god  doesn't give  you everything  That's right  Nah he was  barely losing  it though  is the point  It was  receding  Yeah he had  a little  receding  going  He said  fuck that  He's not  an old  guy  Who's he  dating?  Giselle  Giselle  Bunch 
[01:21:00]  He's married  to her  right?  I guess  Who'd she  date before  him?  Some guy  Was it  Johnny Depp  or fucking  DiCaprio  or something?  Yes it was  Bill Tetley  Yes all  those people  Every single  All of them  Yes  Ronnie B  has Tom Brady  in his fantasy  football pool  Holy shit  Wow how did  Ronnie B  get that coup?  Wow  That's a good  one  And last night  during the game  Ron Jaworski  decided to say  shit and I guess  it's a big deal  for people that  still care about  about the word 
[01:21:30]  shit being on  their TV  First of all  you go around  your basic cable  channels like  FX and  whatnot and  you'll hear  shit  cocksucker  Louis CK  Yeah  On FX  the language  on his show  It's fantastic  Wow  Good for him  So what  hearing shit  and it wasn't  you could barely  make it out  He said it  really quick  and it was  kind of in  a conversational  thing  Isn't it  nonsense at this  point?  We all walk  around saying  shit and then  you watch it  on TV and you  hear shit and  you're outraged  It doesn't make 
[01:22:00]  sense anymore  Maybe in the  50s when they  were planning  that stupid  party  Never drop  the S-bomb  at a party  unless it's  a fucking  You want to  hear it?  an upper  decker in the  bathroom  as a surprise  to pops  when he gets  home  Never drop  a deuce  unless it's  in the mouth  of a sleeping  invalid  If one of  the grandparents  is unable  to defend  themselves  because their  hands are  atrophied  Their stupid  open mouth  squat quietly  over them  on the pillow  and hold  the headboard  using their  mouth as a  toilet

Yes  From four to eight  In 91 
[01:26:30]  Because that's where I lived  For what?  That's where my dad moved  Because he was working  Mustache wax factory  Where did he fucking work in England?

[01:37:00]  No I believe it was  Dempsey  Was it  Tom Dempsey right  Yeah half a foot right  He had a half a foot  Is it Tom Dempsey  That's illegal now  In the NFL  I'm sorry I'm wrong  What to have half a foot  Yeah  What  He had like a hammer  In the yard or something  Wait wait wait wait  How could it be illegal  To have half a foot  That's discrimination  It's illegal now  They decided  You can't  Good  Should be  I hate those half a foot  It has a hammer in it  Did it have a hammer  He had that fucking shoe  That was just flat  On the front  Yeah that wasn't fair  For everyone else 
[01:37:30]  That rules  And that's all he's known for  What was it  A cinder block in there  A block of concrete  Hey yeah I gotcha  It's not illegal  But I don't think  Anyone else is trying  That half foot fucking thing  No you're not going to  Chop your foot off  Didn't he have half an arm too  He looked like a mess out there  Did he  Yeah give us a picture  Of Tom Dempsey  There's a reason  We're bringing up  Tom Dempsey today  Because his record  Was fucking tied  Wow  63  By Sebastian  Bach  Janikowski  Raiders beat the Broncos  23-20  And Sebastian 
[01:38:00]  Tied the record  A 63 yard field goal  Yeah he had  He had no hand  Yeah look he's got  A thalidomide hand  He's got one of those  Little radar  Fucking  Missing a foot  Yeah  And he's missing a foot  What a zilch  And he fucking  Play for the Saints  We usually said that  Play for the Saints  They brought him out last year  Right  How do you  Wait let me see that shoe  Are the laces on the side  Like  How do you tie your shoe  When you don't even have  A fucking foot  You have to nail it to your ankle 
[01:38:30]  That's a dumb foot  It is  It has a hoof  Something looks  Very illegal about that  It's like a Clydesdale  Yeah  His foot bugs me  But now  He was known for that  And now  Now he's got the  It's tied  Oh I can't wait  Till it's broken  By somebody with two feet  And two hands  Yeah  Sebastian  This guy Sebastian  Looks like he'll fucking break it  They can pop lock  Yeah  Janikowski  63 yarder  Huh  Can we get the  Video of that  What year did he set  The first one  The 70s  1948 
[01:39:00]  Oh see I thought it was later  Okay  It had to be the 70s  68  It was 68  Oh 68  Yeah  Okay  I just looked like I just saw that  I thought it was 70  Let's play this  What are you doing  I'm stretching  I want to hear the call  But Sam is just googling the wrong thing  Sam why can't you find this  I can find it  You sure  How come it doesn't say  It's been tied once in history  How are you not finding that 
[01:39:30]  And I want  Can we get the Tom Dempsey one too  He certainly can pull up  The Fiona Apple video in a second  If we asked him to find 9-11 stuff  He'd add them up  And google 20  He's not happy  He doesn't take that one  No he doesn't take this shit well  Because he thinks he's good at everything  Because that's what mother told him  The Kuiper belt  The Kuiper belt  Do you know how adorable  His mom has probably played him  Saying Kuiper  50 times  Because she thinks  It's the cutest thing  That Sammy made on the stage  Because mother told him 
[01:40:00]  Mother  Mother told him he was good at everything  Everything  Kuiper  But  I didn't say that  That was good  We got it right there  That was the replay  Isn't that it  Was this  This was uploaded in January  I don't know  What the  Find today's  It's not up  It is up somewhere  I just did a YouTube search  By his name  And then by upload date  Someone has to have that uploaded already  Just go to Google itself  Not YouTube  Oh someone's screaming  That it's been tied twice  I did not know that  No it hasn't  I mean the first one was disqualified 
[01:40:30]  You sure?  Because the guy went backwards  And it wasn't 63 yards  It was only 37  Oh okay  Joel in South Carolina  Joel  Dude  Do you guys research anything?  Tom Dempsey was the first one  And I apologize  The second one  His name escapes me  Do you research anything  Before you call?  Yeah  What happened now?  It happened  It was tied again last night  Here it is  That's what we were saying  We were just saying that  You mean someone already tied it  Before Sebastian did it last night  Yes  Yeah there was somebody else 
[01:41:00]  That did it a few years ago  And I can't remember who it was  It was in 1998  Fair enough sir  Fair enough  I did not know that  Alright  But Sebastian tied it again last night  Oh here it is  Here's the call  Wow 63 fucking yards  How far that is?  That's crazy  Dude that's amazing  I'm going to hit that  Field goal attempt  Which would match the longest  In NFL history  Sebastian Janikowski  On 63  Kicks on the way  It is  Good 
[01:41:30]  Holy shit  Wow  NFL history tied here in Denver  I should have pushed it back one yard  No kidding  Ah look I'm going to break the record  Could he have made another yard  We've got to see that angle  I know  You've got to show the sideways angle  Let's see if it just made it over the bar  Holy shit  Only two others have hit one from that far  I don't know  I think he'd have hit the pole  Oh here we go  Here we go  And add Sebastian Janikowski  How much room  Ah  Maybe one more yard  He might have done one more yard 
[01:42:00]  He could have done 64  That was really in the lower left corner though  Yeah that was sloppy looking  Hey was that in the thin air of Denver?  First year  Ah  Illegal  You know what?  Asterisk  That might have been in Denver  Yeah Denver records don't stand  No  They've got the thin air  They might as well have helium in your fucking  That's right  They've got the asterisks all over the fucking place  With the records they set there  Because that dumb thin air  Yeah that thin air  There's Denver  Huh?  There's definitely Denver  Figures  I could kick that in Denver with my asshole  Yeah that's no fucking big deal 
[01:42:30]  You're right Jimmy  You're absolutely right  Kick something with your asshole  You pucker up and you push back  And the ball flies off the tee  All right  Manny Ramirez  Let's do our sports break  What the fuck?

You gotta hold the back of that head  Of course she did  When you're slapping a bitch  You don't slap a bitch  Have her smack her head  And then call the cops  And say hey I just smacked my bitch  It's a fair question  Yeah  Fair point on your part  Thank you  Smack my bitch up  Smack my bitch up  Smack my bitch up  Ramirez denied hitting his wife  According to the report  Telling a deputy  He grabbed his wife by the shoulders  And when he shrugged her 
[01:43:30]  She hit her head  That a boy  He shrugged her?  Shrugged her  He's been thinking about that for years  He shook a bitch  That's a hug shake  Smack that bitch up  Yeah  Uh huh  Yeah  Woo  Smack my bitch up  Ow  Oh  I love this song  Remember this?

[01:45:30]  And no he's tased  He's tased  He had the taser  No one expected that  Sometimes the quarterback's got it  The quarterback says  Call Mr. Happy  Mr. Happy  Sure  Casino  Mr. Happy  Here's the video  Yeah so you got an  Off-duty NYPD officer  Oh no that's another story  Wow that's a horrible story  Sorry  The headline is  Off-duty NYPD officer  Killed in car accident  Involving a drunk driver  Was he drunk  The anniversary of 9-11

[01:47:30]  When he was at Florida State  He was arrested for attempting to bribe a police officer  Because they got arrested at a party  And he offered the police officer money to make it go away  Made an illegal hat at the party  And then said he thought he was just offering to pay the fine up front  That's what you do  I like paying the fine right to the police officer  Here at Brainerd  Right here  We could take care of it right here  In Brainerd  I thought  Oh my tags  It's my tags  Did you read who the 
[01:48:00]  A couple years later  He was  Forget it  For the date rape drug  Date rape drug  Date rape drug  Yeah and they've threatened to deport him back to Poland  But somehow once again  He managed to get clean of all the charges  Did you read who the guy with the taser was  At the Dallas game  Oh do tell  He's the father of  Charlemagne the God  From Power 105  I don't know who it is  Charlemagne  He hosts the morning show  Oh no  On Power 105  Oh no really 
[01:48:30]  The number one competitor to Hot 97  New York's  Number one for hip hop and R&B  So are you saying  That perhaps an illegal weapon was brought in  By  An African American  Charlemagne the God's father  Was taken to Bergen County jail  That's right  I'm just wondering  What  Because there's  That we have to do something  I think there's a  There's a problem  That needs to be addressed  Yeah  And solved  Silence the violence  I say  It's about time  Somebody do that  So why are you bringing that up  We don't know that guy 
[01:49:00]  It's radio  It's within the industry  We make fun of everything  Hip hop guys  Alright well we can still  What happened  You know Charlemagne the God  Used to be on Wendy Williams  Let's go to  Music  Music for a second  Yeah just for a split second  I don't have the music anymore  I know  I know  What  Ah  There you go  Last day's Friday 
[01:49:30]  I have no idea  That's what he said  Serena Williams is in a little trouble there Anthony  Yes  She certainly is 
[01:50:00]  She was mouthing off I guess  To one of the line judges  Who gives a fuck about Serena Williams  One of our best stories  One of our favorite stories in the last five years  We have an update on  Oh I know  I heard this  Remember Brett Cummings  Who wouldn't  Well you want to tell the people  Who Brett Cummings was  Brett Cummings is a weatherman  Down in Arkansas  Who was found in a bathtub  By a third gentleman  That was in the house  The owner of the house  He walked into the bathroom  In the morning  After a night of partying  And found  The weatherman  Asleep 
[01:50:30]  Next to a gentleman  Who was naked  With a dog collar on  Dead  Dead  In the bathtub  With a small ring of blood  Dead  On the bottom of the bathtub  You know what  They didn't watch that 1950s video  About how to plan a party properly  They didn't come close  To a dog collar nude  In the pool  In the bathtub  No  They had other party games  But it looks like  Mr. Cummings had his own idea  A leather dog collar  In a bathtub  Nude  That sounds swell  The big contest is to make up alibis 
[01:51:00]  For why your friend is dead  With a bleeding ass in the tub  Brett Cummings  Is no longer a weatherman  No he seems to have  K-A-R-K  He resigned  He turned into his resignation Friday  Which I bet was just to the chagrin  Of K-A-R-K  In Little Rock  You think one person said  Oh don't do it  You know something  Don't leave  Don't leave  This will pass  No one's ever going to just look at you 
[01:51:30]  In the hall continuously  As you walk by and think  Hey that's the guy that woke up  Next to the dead naked guy  In the bathtub  That shit stuff goes away  In weeks  It's water cooler talk  You think he had to talk to HR  Oh yeah  Yeah  He got a meeting  Is there a morality cause  In his contract  Yeah  Yeah  He was sat down  And told  Look  Here is your letter of resignation  That you'll be signing  We went through the trouble  Of writing it  And there's no honesty  So how did they do it  Down there at K-A-R-K  Mmm 
[01:52:00]  Moved on to  Sort our personal matters  Yeah  Something like that  We wish him the best  What was the station's statement?  In a  In a statement  On its website  K-A-R-K  Confirmed that  Cummins tenure at the station  Ended Friday afternoon  Much like the life  Of the man next to him  Nude in the bathtub  His tenure  Is over  Yeah  Yes  Mmm  Poor guy  Supposedly Jenikowski  You know  People that know sports  Way more than we do  Yeah  This fucking guy  Kicks 80 yarders in practice  83 yarders in high school 
[01:52:30]  And he's done  Yeah he's done a bunch  Of 70 yarders  See the problem is  The problem is the angle  You gotta get over that  Fucking  The angle of the dangle  That's the problem  Yeah  You gotta get it high enough  To get it over those  Fucking guys heads  And then it has to  Travel from there  And could explain that shit  Well  Not really  But the thing is  It did look low and left  Oh trajectory  That's what I'm saying  Yes you gotta get over  The guy's heads  Which means you're  Cutting down on your distance  Exactly  Now if there's no one  In front of you  Then you could do those  80 yarders  You could probably do  A better arc  Which will give you  More distance 
[01:53:00]  Right  Than the height you need  To get over the people  Trying to slap that shit  Back in your face  Yeah  Alright Brett Cummings  We hardly knew you  You think he'll get  Another gig  No  Depends on what  Happens to the other guy  Is it over  Yeah he's a weatherman  You think if it was  An accident or something  Yeah he'd get a gig  In I guess  Iowa or San Francisco  Or somewhere  He was in Arkansas  Yeah it's a rough place  It's not like he went  From New York  Got fired  It's like  Alright now I got  50 other states  To choose from  Fucking Arkansas 
[01:53:30]  I'd hire him tomorrow  I would much rather  Hear my weather from him  Than Al Roker  Or somebody  Who hasn't found  A dead naked man  In the tub next to him  Sounds wonderful  Al Roker's terrific though  Is he?  Yeah  Sounds great  Wow Ron Paul got a D  Last night  That sucks  Ron Paul is not  It's a Romney Perry  Ticket  I will wager  Right now  The Republican ticket  Is going to be  A Romney Perry  Or Perry Romney ticket  Is there anyone else  That's it  Goodbye  Tell everyone else 
[01:54:00]  To fucking leave  Stop bad mouthing  The other two  That we need  As candidates  Who's Halperin  By the way  Who grades the debate  That was by Halperin  He's the one  That got in trouble  And survived his  Controversy  Who the Halperin  Yeah what the fuck  Did he say  Was it something about  We already forgot  I don't know  Is he  What is he  A reporter  They were apologizing  Like crazy  And they  And they told him  To go away  For a little bit  And he's back  Of course  Of course he  But that's good to see  Yeah  What did Halperin  Do again  He called him a dick 
[01:54:30]  Oh god yeah  That's right  Yeah  He called Obama a dick  Is he a reporter  Or a congressperson  No he's a  He's a  Talking head  Columnist  Talking head  For  Talking head  Here's what they need to do  And I love how  Because they had  That little debate  Last night on CNN  And of course  Perry and Romney  Were going at it  Especially about  The social security issue  Perry never fucking  Was saying  Let's do away  With social security  He called it  A Ponzi scheme 
[01:55:00]  And when you got  Money coming in  That doesn't  Amount to  The money that's  Going out  Or is very close  To the money  That's going out  It's  You're set up  To start losing money  With it  It's not  You can't set up  A pyramid system  Where people stop working  They get money  Based on the money  From the people  That are working  It becomes a pyramid  A Ponzi scheme  Like he said  He didn't say  Do away with it  He was  Making a statement  That it has to be  Overhauled and redone 
[01:55:30]  Which is the same thing  Romney's saying  But they love  Fucking  Picking up  Where the press  Picked up  And throwing those  Jabs in  Romney and Perry  Better start playing  Nice together  Because they're going  To be the guys  That have to go  Against Obama  Which at this point  Is not going to be  That hard to do  Man that  Fucking guy  With his  God damn  American Jobs Act  American Jobs Act  Doesn't that sound  Constitutional  I mean  Very American  And patriotic  And something  And he was saying  That we should all  Get together on  Then he 
[01:56:00]  Brought one of his  Cronies out  Let one of his  Cronies come out  And tell how  It was going to be  Paid for  By upping the taxes  And throwing taxes  On pretty much  Everything you look at  On a daily basis  Tax and spend  $450 billion  They're looking at  Getting  Through taxing  Through taxes  How about this  Taxes on everything  They want to redo 
[01:56:30]  Some of your  Deductions  So you don't have  Hey you have a kid now  Right  You like that deduction  You have  Hey bye bye  Or at least  A big part of it  I still have enough money  How about  Single  How about a single person  Jimmy's a single person  I am a single person  Yes  Jimmy's a single person  Sure  Examples all over the place  If you make  $250,000  Look out  Because it'll be taxed  Oh wait a minute  Obama brought that  Down to $200,000  A year  As a single person  Then you'll be taxed 
[01:57:00]  Up the shithole  For that  If you are married  It's $250,000  Per household  And he's talking  About giving tax breaks  To small businesses  If you run a small business  For the most part  Your personal income  Is going to be  Over $200,000  So you're getting  A tax break  On one hand  And then they are  Taking it out of  Your hand on the other  Here's my solution  Take the freeloading  Motherfuckers  That are on the  Government till  Put them to work  On the infrastructure  Of the country 
[01:57:30]  Like you want to do  And then the money  You're normally paying them  To sit on their fucking ass  They're rebuilding our nation  Problem solved  You don't have to pay for it  Because you're already  Using that money  For nothing  But they won't do that  Because the people  That are sitting on their ass  And getting the money  Those are his voters  Also the unions  Probably wouldn't like that either  Of course they would  The ones who are  Construction workers  And highway workers  And they are  Pure Obama fans  So just the fact that  And the fact that  His finance crony  Never used the word tax 
[01:58:00]  Never used the word taxes  But gasoline tax  Going up  Every type of tax  You know of  Will go up  In this situation  To try to pay  $450 billion  For a  American Jobs Act  That we must sign now  Must sign  And it will be paid for  Yay everyone claps  This is the same taxes  That could not get through  A Democratic  Congress  A full fucking majority  Would not pass this 
[01:58:30]  As Democrats  You think with Republicans  In there now  It's going to get  Fucking passed  No way  So again  A do nothing  Fucking  Effort  Just so he can then say  Later on  Well you know  The Republicans  Didn't want to give jobs  To Americans  Because he loads it up  With taxes  And then says  It's a jobs act  And then when the  Re-election time  Comes around  He'll bash Republicans  For saying  They didn't want to  Give you jobs  No we don't want to  Be taxed up the  All right  Mikey wants to argue 
[01:59:00]  With you  Mikey in Jersey  Mikey  Hey what's going on  And Mike  Hi my friend  You couldn't be wrong  On more issues  Oh okay good  Good  I must have been  Watching fucking  Spongebob last night  Get rid of the tax  Loopholes  For corporations  Oh tax loopholes  So the taxes won't be  Going up then right  No  Shut up  That means that going up  It's code words  Code words  Revenue streams 
[01:59:30]  You know what that means  Taxes  Closing tax  Loopholes  You know what a tax  Loophole is  Do you know what a tax  Loophole is  Do you know what a tax  Loophole is  It's something that's  Written into tax law  It's part of the  Fucking law  It's not a loophole  It's tax law  They call it a loophole  When they want to  Get rid of it  You fuck  No no no no no  You couldn't be more wrong  That's right  These guys have lobbyists  Over there  That pay for things 
[02:00:00]  And certain  Why doesn't the local  Plumbing store  Or you know  Any other company  Get a tax break  But yet  They do  They do  But yet  Big oil  That's making more money  Big oil man  That's right  Big oil  Big tobacco  And big oil  Halliburton man  Shut your fucking  Communist yap  You freak  You hippie  Fucking cunt bag  He's right though  Shut up 
[02:00:30]  The guy's right  Tell your mother  To shave her armpits  And act like a woman  Fuck you  Fuck you  And you fucking  Hippie shit  What year is this  By the way  I don't know  I just came back  I was in country  What are you  Yeah you're a square  I'm gonna have a good  Hat making party tonight  Alright let's go to Alabama  Robert  Alabama man  Robert  Yeah hey Ant  Ant you're wrong  About what Perry said  He actually 
[02:01:00]  It was two different things  He did make the Ponzi scheme  Statement about the funding  Of Social Security  Exactly  Wait  Fucking second  But he did  But he did also say  That he thought  That Medicare  Social Security  Basically  In their  In their  Very structure  Were unconstitutional  And if  If he thinks  They're unconstitutional  I mean  The logical thing is  He wishes  There was some way  Or he wants  Some way  That he can get rid of them  So those were two different  How long ago  How long ago 
[02:01:30]  Did he say  They were unconstitutional  He said  He said both of these  Things in his book  Both of these things  Were said in his book  In different sections  Which is  Right  Right  In recent years  But I mean  Read Obama's book  There's some fun stuff  In there too  That he doesn't like  Quoting  Look  He  The president  Is not going to  Do away with Social Security  It needs a revamping  Because it is  In essence  A Ponzi scheme  That isn't working  You're absolutely right  But his  People are saying 
[02:02:00]  They're making  The funding thing  They're saying  That's what he was saying  He was actually saying  Both things  He's a horse's ass  You know  My God  Stupid ass  Giuliani  Won't get off his butt  And run  I want somebody  Who's a social  Moderate  And a fiscal conservative  But there's no such animal  Anymore  But  But just  Perry's a horse's ass  Alright  One more  One more  Thank you  Let's go to  Jerry in Philly  Jerry  Alright Jerry  Anthony  I'm sick and tired  Of you with your

[02:06:00]  It's called  Felony Friday  And it's only  Two more nights  It's tonight  And Thursday  That's it  And then the play's over  Yes so you can see  It's a very small  Great theater  Right next door  To the comedy cellar  If it was a great theater  Wouldn't it be up  On Broadway  No  I like the little  Small ones off Broadway  Yeah  What's that doing  Good times 
[02:06:30]  Good times  Good times  The spit was flying out of the top of that 
[02:07:00]  That was a big note  We gotta clean out the spit  Let's break  I gotta piss  John Amos next  Sirius XM  This is the Opie and Anthony Show  We got John Amos outside the studio  Yes  Well now he's inside the studio  Roland's opening the door 
[02:07:30]  Mr. Amos  How are you sir  Mr. Amos  How are you doing  How are you  Great  That's Jimmy  Yes  Anthony  Opie  How are you  Good to meet you  Don't worry about him  John Amos  How are you  A man that hasn't  Aged  Holy  I got a hell of a painting  In my basement  Oh my god  There you go  A little Dorian Gray  Are you a Nets fan  Or are you just wearing the hat  I'm just  Well the truth of it is  As long as they're in Jersey  I'm a Nets fan 
[02:08:00]  When they move to Brooklyn  I don't know how I'm gonna feel  Brooklyn Nets  Sounds kind of fun though  Yeah that could be a good situation for them  Yeah you're from Jersey  Born and raised in Jersey  Born and raised in East Dines  So you'll root for someone  Just cause they're from Jersey  You're like a local guy  Who goes on the team  Absolutely  You don't have a problem with that  Do you  No not at all  So how do you feel  Jets or Giants  What kind  Jets  I think  Giants have so many injuries  Man  Yeah  But the Jets are a Long Island team  It goes against your logic 
[02:08:30]  Back when they played at Shea  They both play in the Meadowlands  Now they do  Yes  So I don't know how they can call themselves  New York teams  I mean they practice in Jersey  They play in Jersey  Yeah  Yeah  I don't know  I guess they don't  Just don't want the New Jersey  Kind of thing on their helmet  Stigma  Yeah  You know what  Over the years  Jersey has had this stigma  Of the big brother New York  Kind of being right there next to them  We live with it  Yeah  I think it builds character  Is that what it is  Something like that  Something like that  It's like getting our ass kicked  Every day on the way home  To school 
[02:09:00]  Give me that lunch money  Exactly  You  Holy  Jeez  What a career you've had over the years  I've been very fortunate  Amazing  Yes  Very fortunate  Absolutely  From early on in the 70s  I want to talk to you a little bit  About Norman Lear  Yeah  Working with him  Because we look at shows  From that era  The early 70s  All in the family  Of course good times  And look at it with this  Knowing that Norman  Was a very liberal guy  But liberal for that time 
[02:09:30]  Is a lot different  Than liberal now  And I think the political  Correctness that's around now  You could never get away  With shows like that  In this day and age  I agree  I agree  Yeah  Norman had a  Had a conscience  And he was hell bent  On elevating people's concerns  And knowledge  About things like  That are prevalent issues now  Gang wars  Like J.J. getting shot  And the fact that some seniors  Had to eat dog food  To survive  Or dog food 
[02:10:00]  Right  Nobody would touch stuff like that  And bigotry and racism  Through Archie Bunker  Exactly  He was fearless  And it was done  In a way where  It didn't have to be  Covered up  In order to  To make an impact  He put it out there  And people were able  To watch it  And make up their own minds  I think in this day and age  Especially with television  We're forced  To be looked at  As if we're stupid  And can't think  By a lot of these writers  Norman was a genius  Being able to  Show us a bigot 
[02:10:30]  Like Archie  Or a situation  And let us  Interpret it ourselves  You know  Instead of hiding it  Like I think they do now  Did you leave good times though  Because you didn't like  The way it was being written  Like was that one of the things  Where you felt  It was going into a direction  You didn't like  That might have been  One of the reasons  I didn't feel the pain so much  But I was  I was fired from the show  Oh I didn't know that  Jesus  No a lot of people  Are under  You know  The misunderstanding  Or the false impression  That I was  That I quit the show  Now we were on hiatus 
[02:11:00]  And I got a call  From Norman's  Assistant  I said  John  Norman would like to speak to you  I said okay  Norman gets on the phone  He says  Hi John  This is Norman  I said yes  I recognize your voice  After two years  Yeah maybe  And he says  Well I got some good news  And some bad news  What do you want first  I said hey  You made the call  He says  Well the good news is  The show's been picked up  For another 22 episodes  Which was  Foregone conclusion  The show was in the top 10  I said yeah 
[02:11:30]  What's the bad news  He said  You won't be with us  I said okay  Wow  And I didn't say anything  So he says  Well aren't you gonna  I said Norman  You made the call  It's your show  Wish you all the best  What was his reasoning  Quote  John you've become  A disruptive factor  Wow  Now did he mean  Like as a character  Or as you  No no  As John Amos  Because  Again people were  Under the false impression  That I was jealous  Of JJ  And that  That was what prompted me 
[02:12:00]  To quote unquote  Quit the show  No it wasn't that  It was that they were  I thought the writers  Were taking a holiday  That we could have  They could have done  A lot better job  I wasn't the most  Tactful diplomatic guy  In those days  I had a frustrated  Football career  Done some boxing  And to me  The best way to settle  Grievances  Let's go outside  Well let's stay inside  If you want to tear  The furniture up  I didn't care  At the time  And sometimes  You've got to be  A little intimidating 
[02:12:30]  If you ask you  To step outside  I'd like to think  I've become  A little bit more  Diplomatic these days  We didn't have a problem  The other night  We had a very pleasant  Chat actually  I thought so  I thought so  I was happy we did actually  I didn't want it  To be unpleasant  Of course not  I made sure I steered  In a very pleasant direction  So we cleared that up  Hopefully once and for all  So nobody will ever  Ask me again  Why did you quit  Good Times  How many years  Did Good Times  Continue after you  Too many  It stayed on the air  For another I think 
[02:13:00]  Four years or so  And then Miss Roll  God rest her soul  She quit it one time  And then they convinced  To come back  It was one of those shows  That really did  Overstay the welcome  After a few years  You have that  Brilliant kind of  First couple of seasons  And then they just  Kind of either  Like you said  Get lazy or run out  Of ideas or something  And then it just became  You know  Alright  Are we going to hear  Dynamite  Tonight  At least once  Every 20 seconds  We get it  Yeah  The writers could take 
[02:13:30]  A holiday  Or put a chicken hat  On JJ  And we don't have to  Write three or four pages  He's just got to walk  In the room  And strut  It's all about  Catchphrases  And have a catchphrase  It's too bad  It did get to  I watched an episode  Yesterday  I was on YouTube  And it was really funny  It was when a sweet daddy  Wants to finance JJ's  Art career  And he walks in  And he says  You have a hostile  You have a hostile attitude  And he says  It's not an attitude  I'm hostile  That really made me laugh  That really made me laugh  What a dummy Normandeer is 
[02:14:00]  John did have some great lines man  What a dummy to fire you  If you quit  That's one thing  But why would you fire a character  That has so many funny lines  I was threatening  The writers lives  That might have had something to do  I mean I can understand  That being disruptive  But did he at least say  Look if you again  Threatened one of the writers  We're going to have to let you go  Did he at least give you a warning  Not really  No  Not really  What were you looking for  More in the writers  Not just being lazy  But what kind of topics  Did you want to  Like for example  My youngest boy Michael 
[02:14:30]  As portrayed by Ralph Carter  A wonderful young actor  In fact  He had been  I think he'd won an Emmy  On Broadway  For Raisin  The musical  And that's when  Norman first saw him  And then Bernadette Stannis  A beautiful young lady  Who portrayed my daughter  On the show  Their characters  Respectively  Wanted to be  A surgeon  I believe  That's what  Thelma's aspiration was  And Michael  As played by Ralph Carter  He aspired to become  A Supreme Court justice  Right  And I thought  There's a great deal 
[02:15:00]  Of humor  That can be  Gotten out of those  Two situations  But again  The writers chose  To make  J.J.'s walk  And you know  The catch phrase  And chicken hats  The crux of the show  Yeah  You know  I didn't want to be  An elitist  But I said  I think we can do  A little bit better  Than that  And again  I wasn't the most  Diplomatic guy  How's your relationship  With J.J.?  Most importantly  My relationship  With Norman  Is very very good  Now  Oh good  I guess  As time went by 
[02:15:30]  In fact  I did  Two more pilots  For Norman  After I was told  By just about  Everybody involved  With the show  You'll never work again  Yeah  You know  Until we need you  Right  And then  Of course  Norman and I  Passed up our differences  And in fact  I was in Vegas  A couple of years ago  To help him celebrate  His birthday  And the fact  That he was being  Recognized  By the television  Guild  You know  An odd thing  I read recently  Was the fact  That you weren't  Really much older  Than Jimmy Walker  Nine years ago 
[02:16:00]  At the time  Well  Yeah  This is true  It was an odd  Situation  It was an odd  Well I've always  Played character parts  I've always loved  Older parts  In fact  The first time  I was ever on Broadway  Which has got to be  150 years ago  I was portraying  A guy in his 60s  So I've always liked  Character roles  I think they're a lot  More challenging  A lot richer  Did you think  Did it have anything  To do with the way  White writers  Write for black characters  Did you think  That that was limited  Or that they were  Kind of 
[02:16:30]  Doing what they saw  From the outside  Instead of getting  Black writers  To help  Well that was  That was one of the  Primary issues  That because you're  A writer on a show  Does not necessarily  Mean that you  Have the knowledge  Of developing  Those characters  I know the first  Writing job I got  Was with the  Leslie Uggam show  Back in the late 60s  And in fact  That would have  Made me  Network television's  First African American 
[02:17:00]  Writer or black writer  For  On staff  So and I got  That gig  Because I was  Working on a  Loman and Barkley  Show  A local radio show  And the thing  That's significant  About that is  Myself  Craig T. Nelson  Barry Levinson  Rudy DeLuca  We all started  Together  Making a hundred  Bucks a week  Barry Levinson  Was an actor  No no he was  Well yeah he was  An actor  If they hire you  Here at Sirius  You can make  A hundred bucks  A week again  Believe me  No kidding  It pays like shit  In regards to  Your question  Yeah that was  An issue 
[02:17:30]  Because they  Wanted to write  Not just about  A black family  But a black family  That lived in  The projects  At Cabrini Green  Projects in Chicago  And that is a  Very unique  Social situation  Unless you've  I honestly believe  Unless you've  Been in a situation  At least confer  Or defer  Or both  To those people  That have lived there  Or that know  Exactly how  They would conduct  Themselves in a situation  You can always put  The humorous spin on it  But don't just  By virtue of the fact  That you're  You know you have 
[02:18:00]  Television credits  Or you've been a writer  In the guild  Or whatever  They felt  Qualified them  To just  Make us  Just do the lines  I said no  It can't roll like that  Because they're kind  It feels like  There's a weird  Balance between  Showing something  Accurately  And look  Sometimes stereotypes  Are true  But then there's  Cartooning something  Where you see something  And you just  All you're doing  Is going off  The stereotype  And you're not  Realizing that  There's other humor  That would happen  In that house  That's not just  JJ yelling something  Dynamite or whatever  It is  Right 
[02:18:30]  But at the same time  We realized  We were doing a sitcom  Right  And the primary purpose  Is to entertain people  Make them laugh  So they  Yeah it got  Kind of  It got kind of  It was tension  Filled at times  A great deal  Of the time  I can imagine  But I saw  A couple of the  Characters  Your character  Especially  James Evans  Was a strong  Leader  Father character  In that show  Oh no doubt  But you know 
[02:19:00]  The only reason  I got the job  Was because  Of Miss Roll  Esther Roll  When the show  Was offered to her  They wanted it  To be a perpetuation  Of what was  Stereotypical on television  Everything was a matriarch  Yeah  And she said  No I want a husband  On this show  Yeah  Can I have a husband please  Can I have a husband please  So I auditioned  And the chemistry  Was  It was solid  The first time  We met each other  And I  I missed her  I missed the union  That we had  On that show 
[02:19:30]  Yeah  It was a great balance  I do a one word  Esther Roll  Impression  Please  Oh boy  James  Very good  Thank you  Leave your eight  But didn't  By the dog  Thank you very much  Hey come on  If there's one thing  I always wanted to do  It was my  Esther Roll  James impression  Okay  In front of John Amos  It would be so great  If he just got up  And broke your jaw  Not too late  I do have a  Good time story  Myself there 
[02:20:00]  When I was growing up  John  I stole a Playboy  Oh now  Of course  I did  I did though  Remember when  Thelma was in Playboy  Thelma was in Playboy  No  You sure you got the right  She did do a  I think there was  Some kind of  I saw that Playboy  I'm assuming it was Playboy  I'm not sure  I'm looking now  At comments  To see if you're an idiot  No no no  He's probably right  On the air  I said Florida 
[02:20:30]  And I made the big  Snafu there  But it was Thelma  Oh you said Florida  Was in Playboy  Yeah  No Mike  Oh yeah  That was a mistake  It was a mistake  I was trying to say  Thelma  No I don't think so  I will bet a lot of money  That Thelma  I saw Thelma nude  And I had to steal  That magazine  When I was a kid  Yeah she was a sex symbol  And then I hid it  In the woods  She was a sex symbol  Where else would you hide  That kind of stuff  Yeah  I want to move on  A little bit  To Roots  Obviously probably  A highlight of your career  There  No doubt  Emmy nomination  What was that like 
[02:21:00]  On set  Because that was really  The first time  The story was confronted  And it was acted out  Between people  In a realistic manner  Between whites and blacks  In front of a camera  But having to say  Horrific things to each other  You really didn't see that  At the time  Was it uncomfortable  Between the actors  No on the contrary  But everybody was working  Towards something  That we all knew  Was bigger than us  The story  And again I go  I started in the business 
[02:21:30]  As a writer  So I've always had  Tremendous respect  For writers  Because they're  The magic workers to me  They sit in a room  Alone as a rule  With blank paper  And turn it into  Something magical  That if they're really  About their business  And really about their craft  That years from now  Maybe even centuries  From now  In the case of  Great writers  People can look at  Those symbols on paper  And recapture those moments  Relive those moments  And reanimate those moments  Right  So to me  It all starts with writing  This present project  I'm in now 
[02:22:00]  Felony Friday  Which is an incredible  Piece of writing  For my money  And I've had the pleasure  Of working with some  Of the best people  In the industry  You mentioned Norman Lear  When we did the  Mary Tyler Moore show  Of course it was  Grant Tinker  Yeah  And James Brooks  Who obviously went on  You know  To tremendous success  Sure  Not just with The Simpsons  But with  Taxi  Taxi  And  The Jack Nicholson film  In which Jack  Won the Academy Award 
[02:22:30]  Terms of Endearment  Or Cuckoo's Nest  No not Cuckoo's Nest  Cuckoo's Terms of Endearment  And As Good As It Gets  I think  I forget which one it was  I'm not gonna  But the bottom line is  It all starts  With the writing  And this young man  Scott Decker  Who's written  Felony Friday  Wow  When I first  Got the script  I was in California  And they emailed it to me  And I said  Who is this guy  I'd never heard him  I said  What has he been taking  Because the writing  Is off the chain 
[02:23:00]  It must be really nice  You've been in the business  For many years  When you get a script  That knocks on your ass  Yeah  That's gotta  You gotta appreciate that  No doubt  I mean  I was pretty much  Satisfied with the idea  Of retirement  Really  I like to fish  I've been living in Mexico  The last 10 years  And the fishing there  Is great  The weather's great  It rains one day a year  I said  Retirement's not too bad  You know  I can still come out  And do my one man show  Once in a while  But in terms of pursuing  You know  Aggressively pursuing 
[02:23:30]  Acting jobs  I said no  I much prefer to write  And fish  But when I read this  I said  I know it doesn't pay anything  This is the Friends series  But I needed to test my chops  To see if I could still  You know  Muster up the energy  Required to do rehearsals  To commute into the city  To do rehearsals  To work with an ensemble  And when  When we started working together  Once  The actors  And the rest  Of the cast  Had an advantage over me  Because I drove  Across country 
[02:24:00]  To get  To  You know  Get to the city  And that took several days  And of course  They were rehearsing  So when I got there  I was behind  In regards to rehearsals  But they were so supportive  And we got a tremendous cast  I just want to plug  A couple of my fellow artists  Oh hell yeah  In addition to Scott  Scotty Decker  Who wrote  And stars in the piece  I don't really think  In terms of  Any of us starring  Because it's a true ensemble  We feed off each other  We help each other  These guys carried me  In particular 
[02:24:30]  The lead actor  The character  Is focused around  A fictional crime boss  Joe Whistler  Is the actor  He's incredible  Everybody in the company  Is incredible  And again  This is without  Any  You know  Big humongous  Compensation  Well maybe  They'll give you  Maybe they'll let you  Buy a papaya dog  At a discount  Or a Big Mac  But that's about it  But this is for 
[02:25:00]  Satisfaction  For the satisfaction  On your part  As an actor  Just having  Seen such a good script  Right  Working with such a great cast  You play a convict  I play  Well he hasn't been  Convicted yet  But he's certainly  Been arrested  His name is BBI  Which stands for  Big, Black, and Invisible  And you have to see  The play to really see  Well how does that work out  Yeah right  You know what I mean  I'm going to go to see  The play  But you're going to be  Invisible  No  It's a wonderful play  This character  Joe Whistler 
[02:25:30]  Portrays a fictitious  Crime boss  Who has taken it  On to himself  To locate  Identify  And murder  Rapists  And those who  Prey on women  So he takes them  To his father's basement  But the moral  If there is  Of this play  Is that we are  All held accountable  For our actions  I  My character  BBI  Has killed  His wife's lover  He got off work  Early one day  Came home  And found them  Together  In a  Compromising position 
[02:26:00]  So we say  You know  Running through  The whole  Kama Sutra  You know  And he takes  The guy out  With his bare hands  And beats him  To death  Damn near  Caved his head in  So he has  He's haunted  By that  And all of these  Characters  In this holding tank  And that's where  It takes place  Now what's significant  About the fact  That it takes place  In a holding tank  I don't know  If I got to share  This with you  The other night  Jim  When we were  Talking outside  The cafe  Walk  I used to work 
[02:26:30]  At Center Street  At the Brooklyn  House  At the Brooklyn  House of Detention  And in the tombs  Not as a  Correction officer  But as a social worker  Oh wow  I started  My career  At the cafe  Walk  Okay  Yeah  I work as a  Social worker  In the institutions  During the day  And then to get rid  Of the stink  Of the prisons  The mental stink  And the physical  Stink  I'd go down  To the village  And watch comedians  And one night  I couldn't stand  Anymore 
[02:27:00]  I mean I saw  Some guys go up  I said I know  I can do better  Than that  And so I asked  The manager  The then manager  Of the cafe  Well I said  Can I go up  He said  What do you do  Do you sing  I said no  No I'm a  I'm a comedian  He said oh yeah  What's your name  I said John  He said I never  He heard of you  I said well  I have another job  During the day  But can I go  Up he said yeah  You got five minutes  You go on about  Twenty minutes  So I went up  I did five minutes  I died  That's when I  That's when I developed  The love for what it is  You do so well 
[02:27:30]  Comedians  You walk into a room  Complete strangers  Some have hemorrhoids  Their cards  And repositions  Whatever  You gotta make  These people laugh  To me they're the most  Courageous  Inventive minds  In the industry  Because you can take  Any issue  If you're as sharp  As you are  And so many  Of the other comedians  That I really admire  And make people laugh  And that was a great  Training ground  At that time  Richard Pryor  Was working up  Robert Klein  The late Godfrey Cambridge  Bill Cosby  They were all 
[02:28:00]  Just getting started  And it was  A fascinating time  To be coming up  In the business  And to not know  That they were going  To go where they went  Right  But just to see  That brilliance  At that time  Must have just been amazing  And looking back  In retrospect  I was  I mean you could go  To any club  And learn from the best  The guys who were  On their way  To being the best  And I grew up  With television  My generation  But I had  Masters on television  Show of shows 
[02:28:30]  In that entire company  Milton Burrell  You know  Oh wait a minute  From Texaco  We've worked for  Maine in Mexico  The Texaco Star Theater  You know what I'm saying  Yeah  And to see them  And then to watch  Amos and Andy  Which got booted  Off the air  Because of some  Very conservative elements  But my name being  John Amos  I was pissed off about  Oh wow  Hell yeah  I didn't even think  That probably was like  Hey  But it was no different  From Sergeant Bilko  I mean Andy  Was the foil 
[02:29:00]  And Doberman was  Doberman was Bilko's foil  So you don't even know  What we're talking about  No I know the show  I don't remember it  I'm in my late 20s  You know  You look horrible  Teenage years were rough  They really were bad  There are certain shows  From a while back  That they still follow  The same formula  These days  You have your  Absolutely  Your foil  Your other guy  The two guys  Play off each other  The wacky neighbor  Is still a staple  Of the sitcom 
[02:29:30]  And you look back  At things like  The Honeymooners  And see that was  What was happening  At the time  And it's just  A credit to those  Early shows  That wow  This is still  Working  And still pertinent  You know  Exactly  Do you  When you did stand up  Did you continue  Doing stand up  Or did you do it  A few times and stop  Or did you always  Continue doing it  I always continued  Doing it  It was just a degree  Of regularity  Even to this day  I'll be out in LA  Visiting my son  Who is  Hi Casey  If you hear this  He's a 
[02:30:00]  He's a  Very well respected  Director  Anyway  Cut to the chase  When I'm out there  Visiting him  Or any family member  Just out  You know  In LA  Every once in a while  I'll feel the need  To go to the comedy store  Get up on stage  And do 15 or 20 minutes  Whatever I  You know  And it's cheaper  Than the therapist  Yeah it's good  Get up there  It's good  Speak your piece  There it is  There it is  But I'm always afraid  Of a lot of actors  Will say that comedy  Is hard  But for me  Acting is much more  Difficult 
[02:30:30]  And impressive  Yeah  I really  I love you  But he's right  I stink  Patrice O'Neill  Told me I have  Silent film eyes  When I act  Which is right  But I really am  Fucking terrible  Oh fuck  I really am awful  You know my mood  By the reaction  Of other people  In the room  I can't convey anger  To me it's hard  Because if you're  Falling apart  In a scene  As a comedian  I can address it  As a stand up  I can go wherever I want  I can just say  This stinks 
[02:31:00]  I'm terrible  Or whatever  And bail myself out  But when you're  Bombing in a scene  You're trapped  To me that's  The scariest thing  On earth  You know that's  Funny you say that  Because I've always  Regarded comedians  As the bravest  The most inventive  People in the industry  And as an actor  When I get  If I get a character  Like I've got  With this piece  Felony Friday  I can climb  Inside of that  And after a while  You start feeling  That you can give  The director  In this case  Our director  And especially Scott 
[02:31:30]  Who created the piece  Exactly what they want  To see happen  I mean I give it to them  Exactly  But we start  Working towards that  And we've got  An abbreviated schedule  In terms of  The number of performances  And all the actors  Feel like we're  Just beginning  To find our way  Initially we started  Doing this piece  Painting with rollers  I call it  And now we're starting  To get down  To the two inch brushes  The detail work  Just about the time  We get ready  To do the detail work  It runs over  Right right right  But I have a very  Strong feeling 
[02:32:00]  That with Scotty Decker's  Talent  And the buzz  That's out on this piece  Felony Friday  That it may have  An afterlife  If so I hope  I'm available  To commit to it  I was so annoyed  I couldn't go  Because you invited me  To go  I was shooting something  And we didn't finish  Hopefully yourself  Oh Ant  Way to hurt guys' feelings  No compassion in this room  No whatsoever  I just try to be good  It's all I want  Is to be good  Right  No I  It was an hour  After the play had started  When we were actually  By the time we finished 
[02:32:30]  I got you  And there is a  It's right by the comedy cellar  If you guys know  Where Cathie Waugh  And the comedy cellar  It's sandwiched between them  And it's where  Teller did his play  The Players Theater  Players Theater  It's right  It's a great little upstairs  No it's actually not upstairs  It's on the ground level  And it's called  Felony Friday  And it's 212-475-1449  And there's two shows left  There is one tonight  At what  8 o'clock  7.30  7.30  And is it Thursday show  Thursday show at 9.30 
[02:33:00]  Which is pretty late  But then again  We hope to have a good crowd  For the closing show  We had a full house  The first night  We moved into  The Players Theater  And the audience response  Was incredible  I've started to enjoy  I never liked plays  I never went to them  And I've gone to a few  Like in the last couple of years  And I started to love going  Because it seems so much harder  Than film acting  Which is hard enough  But when you're on stage  It's like you have to  You know  I'm telling him  But you have to emote  It's hard enough to do  It's hard enough to do  It's hard enough to do it  As a camera  It helps  Like when you're on stage 
[02:33:30]  You've got to get laughs  I mean  It'd be nice  I mean  No but it's good  That I'm helping you  John remember  Picture the naked  That really helps  You should just  Knock my teeth out  I'm an idiot  And is this a single set  It's a single set  Okay so it's the cell  The holding cell  The holding cell  I just found that  An interesting thing  Because Reservoir Dogs  Was originally that  When it was a play  It was written as a play  It was a single set play  All in the warehouse theater 
[02:34:00]  He has very very skillfully  Blended a mix of film  Which opens this play  There's a film clip  Which introduces you  To Paul Giacomati  This fictitious crime boss  Played by Joe Whistler  And how he gets busted  And how he gets to the cell  Of the holding tank  And once he's there  Then the play opens up  And we go to the stage  But we put  We try to put that audience  In that holding cell  And having worked 
[02:34:30]  Like I said  The tombs  In the Brooklyn House  Of D  I know what the behavior  Can be like  In a holding cell  So these are now  People that do not  Know each other  And are first introduced  To each other  And kind of  Actually  No most of us  Don't know each other  But we find out later  That Paul Giacomati  Knows one of the  One of his fellow inmates  Or would you say  Or cell members  Because  This particular character  That he knows  Is  Is  Is gay 
[02:35:00]  I mean blatant  He's  Practicing homosexual  Male prostitute  By the way  If you knew how amazing  It was that you said that  And he walked in the room  I know you didn't plan  Sam  Sam walked in  That was a Laverne and Shirley  Hello  Someone called  And you couldn't see  But he actually backed in  I'm so happy  That just happened  Oh is that perfect  I'm going to leave that alone  So one of the characters  Is gay  I'm sorry  One of the characters  Is gay  Another is absolutely insane  He's probably fried his brain  With every drug known to man 
[02:35:30]  And he looks amazingly  Like Tom Hanks  In Castaway  So we all refer to him  As Tom Hanks  In any one of Tom Hanks' movies  So  I don't want to give  The whole play away  But  Suffice to say  This is a mix  Of characters  Who interact  And then they are visited  By Jack  And Jack  Is the  Reincarnated form  Of  A man  A police  A dirty cop  Who Paul Giacomati  Whacked in his basement 
[02:36:00]  So he's sitting there  In a holding cell  And in walks Jack  In a new body  And begins to  Make him account  For his  The number of people  That he murdered  In his father's basement  Sounds like a damn  Interesting show man  It is  Trust me  In the dialogue  Again  For me  It all starts  With the writing  That's why  I get excited  When I read it  I said  I gotta do this  I wanna be part  Of this ensemble  Not in hopes  That it would  Go on  To get me a job  Cause if they did  If they did the  John Amos story  They'd probably 
[02:36:30]  Want to get  Samuel L. Jackson  No I'm serious  There used to be  A billboard  That hung  You'd appreciate  This  A billboard  That hung  Over the strip  In L.A.  Across from the  Comedy store  In fact  It said Hollywood  The place where  If they were doing  The story of your life  You wouldn't be  Writing for it  I wanna hurry up  And get the  John Amos story  Done before  Samuel L. Jackson  Florida motherfucker  I don't care  If you all  Go to hell  Sammy let somebody 
[02:37:00]  Else work  Please Sam  If you're listening  I mean I got a  Granddaughter in  Medical school  You don't need to  Make all the  Movies all the  Time  I mean come on  Coming to America  Fucking hilarious  It was a good movie  You were great  In that movie  The McDonald's  Rip off  Before I break  My leg off  In your royal ass  What a great line  I was proud of  That line  Cause the one  They had originally  Written for me  When I come back  At King Jaffe Joffer  Played by  The great James Earl 
[02:37:30]  James Earl Jones  The line was  Hey King  You talk to my  Daughter like that  Again  I'm gonna drop you  Like a bad habit  And I said  I think we  I'm from Jersey  We can come  Leave this  You know  So without  Telling anybody  I had lived  That line at the  Table when we  Had a read through  And Eddie  Put the seal of  Approval on it  Cause Eddie  Was a litmus test  As soon as I  Said King  You talk to my  Daughter like that  Again  I'm breaking my  Foot up in your  Royal ass  Eddie said  He laughs like a 
[02:38:00]  Mule  I said yeah  So John Landis  Says oh that  Just might work  Yeah I said  I think so  There's nothing  Worse than when  You're reading  Something and  A line and  That was a  Very well  Written film  But when you  Look at a  Line and  You're like  Ah it's weak  There's nothing  Worse than a  Weak joke line  Like a saw  And you know  Some fucking  Normally it's  Some fruity  Writer that has  No real life  Experience  That's really  Dangerous  It's not  There's nothing 
[02:38:30]  More uncomfortable  Than that  I'm telling you  You've had  Comedy roles  And very dramatic  Roles too  Which a lot of  Actors they can't  Really ride that  Line  But they find out  When they try  Comedy that  There's a lot  More to it  Than just  Hey a funny  Thing happened  No you know  Right  Do you find it  More difficult  In movies to  Be funny than  It is to be  Dramatic  I like  Yeah more  Difficult because  You can't get  The feedback  You don't know  The crew  If they're a  Disciplined crew  Is a rule  They can do  They can let you 
[02:39:00]  Know  It ain't working  But when it  Is working  And I've had  The experience  Of being around  Crews that  Were disciplined  Enough to hold  Their laughter  Until the director  Said cut  Then they'd fall  Off the boom  You know  If it was a boom  And that to me  Is the ultimate  Compliment  When you get  A crew to laugh  You see guys  Trying to stifle it  And they've heard  It all  They've seen it all  You know  Yeah there's  I'm waiting for that  Moment  When the cameraman  Laughs  When you see the  Cameraman laughing  You're like 
[02:39:30]  That's fucking funny  Yeah because he  Is not supposed  To do that  These guys can  Film beheadings  Without being said  Nothing matters  To them  They really  They're unflappable  Most times  When you break  The crew  You feel like  Oh okay  That's shit  I did something  That's what happens  A couple of great  Actors start talking  About things  Men of similar ilk  You guys were  Leading over there  Yeah  Did you have a  Relationship with  Prior at all  Richie  Only to the degree  That Richie and I  Did  I did work with him  Several times  He was 
[02:40:00]  He still is  For my money  A comedic genius  My business manager  Richard Cook  This guy's very stoic  I mean  He hardly ever emotes  He sent me  An excerpt  From one of Richard's  Shows just last week  And in this one  Richard Pryor  Is portraying  The president  Of the United States  At a press conference  And I didn't realize  Until I saw this  And I'd seen all his films  I'd seen him on stage  And I'd followed him  On stage  Richard was a fine actor  Yeah he was great  I mean  Even to this day 
[02:40:30]  You look at that  That piece  Where he's  Where he's playing  The president  Initially  You see  He's working very small  And he's got all  The presidential  Nuances  To a hiked eyebrow  And then he  Slides slowly  Into Richard Pryor  When one of the guys  Says something about  Look if your mother  Doesn't  Whoa wait a minute  You said something  About my mama  Richard was a genius man  You ever see  He was great  In Grease Lightning  And Lady Sings the Blues  In fucking Blue Collar  Oh did I annoy Diana Ross 
[02:41:00]  I met her on a plane  And I was trying to ask  If Pryor was  Because I'd heard  He was difficult to work with  I'm a Pryor freak  And I'm like  I want to know  You could say  You annoyed Diana Ross  And just stop with  I went up to her  Yeah I did  That's pretty much  She was on the plane  In front of me  So I wanted to ask her  What was he like  To work with  Because again  I've heard things  And I love Pryor  And I'm like  Because I heard  Cicely Tyson said  That in Bustin' Loose  He was kind of hard  To be around  And she's like  Well Cicely Tyson  Wasn't in Lady Sings the Blues  And I'm like  No no no I know  And she's like  I'm like I said 
[02:41:30]  Bustin' Loose  And she goes  Oh  And she ignored me  I had really annoyed  Diana Ross  Just trying to fish  For prior information  There should have been  An air marshal on there  To tackle you  The guy who was sitting  Next to her  The whole flight  Who had bonded with her  I just cut in between them  And I followed her  Off the plane  And asked her a photo  And she said no  You're a creep  You're a stalker  You have no idea John  I'm only a five minute stalker  Like I walk away  As soon as he gets his picture  He's done  That's the most important part  Of Jim's life  You don't like taking photos 
[02:42:00]  You're like  One of the most recognizable guys  When you were  When you were sitting  Outside the cellar  Every person that walked by  Knew who you were  That's the power of the tube man  The only other reaction  I've ever seen that  From is Sherman Hemsley  Who I know  He came to the comedy cellar  One night  And every homeless guys  Were yelling out to him  But  Like everybody knows that guy  And it is like you said  The power of the tube  It's the power of the tube  You're in people's homes  Generation after generation  In my case  To this day  Yeah  By way of example 
[02:42:30]  I was doing a movie  With Sidney Poitier  And Bill Cosby  Let's do it again  So we had a camera break  Where I think we were  Shooting on the MGM lot  And I'm standing on the corner  Of one of the sets  And I'm standing there  With Sidney  We just finished our lunch  And some tourists  Came by in a bus  And they looked at Sidney  But they came over  And took pictures  And asked me for autographs  And I said  And we're standing right  Next to each other  So when they left  I said  Sidney what was that man  His explanation was 
[02:43:00]  You're in their homes  When they see me  I'm 35 feet by 17 feet  And I'm  John  I'm a movie star  So I always appear  To be inaccessible  But you  They feel like  They can come up  You know  Give me a shoe shine  What a nice backhanded  Compliment that is  You know  I'm a movie star  So you're on TV  I was Mr. Tibbs  Motherfucker  You think Sidney was annoyed  He started dropping little things  He kept talking about the Oscar  And the Oscar  No he's cool man 
[02:43:30]  I know  I met him in a pharmacy  I bug him  Yeah  I met him in a pharmacy  You stuck Sidney too  You cracked me up Jimmy  Honestly I was getting Cialis  I was in a pharmacy  In Beverly Hills  You're out of Viagra  I don't take Viagra  It gives me a bad headache  But Cialis stays in the system  For three days  And I was like  Oh that's what a man  Should feel like  So I saw Sidney Poitier  And I'm just standing there  And Sidney Poitier  Walked by me  So of course I talked to him 
[02:44:00]  Because he directed Sir Crazy  So I started asking him  About Pryor  And he was actually very sweet  And we talked for a few minutes  And then I got a photo  He was cool  Yeah but nobody else asked him  You know  Beverly Hills  They all try to pretend  They don't care  Oh yeah  Like they don't see you  Or well  Sidney Poitier  There's nobody  That wasn't psyched  There's not an actor  I've got an actor in the world  I want to stop and talk to him  Who am I going to not  Speak to him  And ask for a photo  Why'd you stop boxing?  Because I got beat up  Oh okay  It's the same reason  I should quit acting  No man 
[02:44:30]  After my last fight  The Fulmer brothers  Had a young fighter  They brought in from Utah  And I fought in the Colorado  Golden Globes finals  Named Johnny Bullocks  To this day  Johnny and I talk  Every three or four years or so  If we can get a hold of each other  To this day  He contends that he won the fight  He did  He won the decision  Split decision  But what convinced me  To stop fighting  Was  For several days  I couldn't open my mouth  To worry 
[02:45:00]  Oof  And then  When  After the  About the second day  After the fight  Somebody said  Excuse me  What is your name sir?  And I said  Oh  He said  Oh  Wow  I had to think for a minute  That's a hell of a punch  And I said  Oh no  No I could see what was coming  Right  And then I looked at some of the other guys  That had made careers out of boxing  I said  I'm not that good  I tried professional football  And  Once I got over the initial thing  Of venting the hostility  And  And beating some guy 
[02:45:30]  Up  You know  And  Or waiting a month  For the swelling to go down  If he beat me up  I said  I don't want to do this for a living  There's got to be another way man  Were you not good enough to play  Like you were good to play college ball  Or whatever  But just  You couldn't make that  Transition to the pros  Transition to the  And I had every opportunity  Hank Stram  God rest his soul  When I was with Kansas City  Under contract  To the Chiefs twice  He told me  He said  John  You are not  A football player  You are a young man  Who happens to be  Trying to play football 
[02:46:00]  Right now  So before  He released me  The second time  And this is when my life  Took a turn  I said  Coach  I know you got to cut me  You got to get down the roster  But I've written a poem  About the Turk  That mythical figure  That cuts players  You know  Hey Norton  Coach wants to see you  And I'll bring you a playbook  And you know  It's all over  It's like  Nice son  Just leave your 8x10  By the door  In our business  So I read this poem  And he had gathered  All the players together  Because they were having 
[02:46:30]  A blackboard session  A skull session  And after I read the Turk  These guys gave me  A standing ovation  A lot of them  Would go on  To the Hall of Fame  A lot of them  Would get cut  But they all knew  Who the Turk was  Because they all feared him  And that's the shadow  That sword of Damocles  That hangs over the head  Of every professional athlete  You don't know  When it's going to come  I mean you can have a career  To put you in the Hall of Fame  But sooner or later  You're going to get cut  Or be asked  Would you mind retiring please  You know  And so that gave me 
[02:47:00]  The encouragement  To  Hey I said  I can write  I can write stuff  Oh  You know  And once you get  That confidence going  And so Hank Stram  Cut me from football  But he kind of  Pushed me towards  What it was  I've been doing  For the last  You know  Decades  Plural  That must take a lot  Of balls though  For a guy to walk up  To somebody that  He probably knew  You were very passionate  About it  And say look  Hey  You're just not  A football player  You know  That's a ballsy move  We had the biggest team 
[02:47:30]  In football  In Kansas City  At the time  I had guys in front of me  Like Mike Garrett  Had won the Heisman Trophy  I signed as a free agent  I had to pay my own way  To camp  I drove to camp  I towed my motorcycle  To camp  I had bought a bike  And I towed it to camp  So not only did I get cut  From the team  I come out the day  I get cut  And somebody stole  My motorcycle  No this is true Jimmy  Honestly  But we trained  At that time  In Liberty Missouri  A very small town  So I went down  To the street corner  The main drag in town 
[02:48:00]  Wearing my Chief's t-shirt  And the first kid  That came by on a bike  I said hey  You want to make $500  I didn't have it  I said I'll give you a reward  You helped me locate  My motorcycle  He said what kind of bike was  I told him  It was a purple matchless  He said ah  And I said oh yeah  I got it  Oh yeah  Alright  Yeah  So I listened to him  Peel out  He never gets out  Of second gear  And I said my bike  Is close by  So he comes back  And he says  I think I know  Where your bike is  I said me too  Fuck you  You ain't getting a guy 
[02:48:30]  So I went to the kid's house  Sure enough  There's my bike dismantled  And the kid's not home  But his father says  I wondered where he got  This bike from  Does it belong to you  I said yeah  He said what do you intend to do  I said I intend to  Have your son  Put it back together  And take my  He said you don't want  To find no charges  I said no  In fact  As I think about it  He can buy it  So I sold him  To the kid  The bike  Never pressed charges  The only thing  That got me really pissed  Of was I had no money  I couldn't go back 
[02:49:00]  To training camp  So I had to sleep  In the jail  For three days  While they processed  And the kid  Everything  And put the bike back  They allowed you  To sleep in the jail  Yeah  They said well  You're welcome  To stay here with us  Son  I said yeah  Okay  Like Mayberry  Yeah  I slept in the jail  For three days  In Liberty, Missouri  I spent one night  In jail  In the tombs actually  It was a radio stunt  With these guys  For these guys  Not with these guys  Went awry  Yeah  And we got arrested  It happens  It was really bad  27 hours 
[02:49:30]  And the worst part  About being in jail  Was when you have to shit  The toilets are so bad  That you don't want to shit  That was the worst part of it  Any other information  I should give you  No no no  I'm telling you  That caused me  To save receipts  And pay my taxes  Because I never want  To go back to a place  Where I can't  Can you imagine  Doing an eight year bid  And not shitting  How awful that would be  One night  That's a hell of a backup  Especially on the day  You get out  And by the way  The ball is  To read a poem  In front of a football team  I think that was the point  That was ballsy  To be on a team  And read 
[02:50:00]  I wouldn't read a poem  In front of you guys  I want to hear this poem now  Is it online or something?  I'll tell you what I'll do  I'll come back  And I'll do it for you  That'd be cool  Yeah  Will that work?  Yeah  It's called The Turk  And it chronicles my experiences  From my aspirations  To be a pro football player  To getting cut  And all the guys  That The Turk  Will come for  He'll come for those  No cuts  He'll come for the vets  He'll even cut coaches  Pay them off  Send them home  He'll cut a new  Hacker squad  Down to the bone  And it goes on like that 
[02:50:30]  You know  It starts with my career  Which began  Career you could call it  With the Denver Broncos  I got cut  The second day  Because I pulled a hamstring  And I couldn't even run  The 40 yard dash for time  Which is the first thing you do  The saving grace was that  The Broncos in those days  Were training at my college  Colorado State University  I lived around the corner  From where they train  So when I got cut  I limped home around the corner  You know  You didn't have to go too far  I didn't have to go too far 
[02:51:00]  But after you get cut 13 times  From 13 teams  Oh wow  You gotta find  Well 12  Because the chief cut me twice  The thing that was good about it  Though  It gave me a lot of scar tissue  For this business  You know  Oh yeah yeah  You know  For being rejected for parts  And turned down  For one reason or another  You go for  Well we're gonna go another way John  Yeah  You know  Well that's not gonna work out  And you hear every form of rejection  And after a while  It doesn't faze you anymore 
[02:51:30]  Yeah  How did you not freak out  When they said to you  Like we wanna continue  That's  I don't like the way  Norman Lear did that  The good news  Bad news  We got picked up  It's like why would you say  That is good news  That's not good news for him  Yeah unless Norman  Was probably angry at that time  Maybe he was  You know  He wanted to really rub it in  Turn the screws a little bit  Yeah I think so  But I'd been on hiatus  And I was  You know  I was relaxed  And I was  I was fine with where I was  In my life  And as God would have it  Some months later  I got the role of  Kunta Kinte in Roots  And I never looked back 
[02:52:00]  So  I'm glad I held on  Right  You know  To what I thought  Was right at the time  I think the most gratifying thing  In my good times  Is a reaction I get  From young men  In particular  Just about every ethnic stripe  You can imagine  They come up to me  And they'll say  You know  I watched that show growing up  You're the father I never had  And  I've had it from  Literally  Every race of human being  Imaginable  And that's a good feeling  Because you feel like  Hey I did something worthwhile 
[02:52:30]  You know  I remember you scaring  The crap out of me  As I was growing up  Watching it  It was just like  Because you were always  Ready at the drop of a hat  For your family  Right  To beat the living shit  Out of somebody  That's what it takes  And it was frightening man  You're just like  Oh man  You put that face on  And it would just be like  Oh shit  Here goes James  He's pissed  But that's what kids  That's what kids need today  Right  Somebody to say  Uh uh  No that's wrong  You go that route  I'm gonna be all over you  You know 
[02:53:00]  And when I was coming up  That's the way it was  Even though my dad  Wasn't there initially  He and my mom split  When I was younger  We got to know each other  When I was a baby  And we got to know each other  By the time I hit my teens  And went out to junior college  In California  And then a real son  Father relationship started  But I modeled James Evans  After John Amos Sr.  Because that's  That's who he was  If you saw me on Good Times  You saw my father  Oh really  That was it  Complete with the catchphrases  Like I would use everything 
[02:53:30]  He would say  You ask my dad  An obvious question  He'd just look at it  And say  Is an elephant heavy?  Okay I got that  He's heaven happy  You know  He'd say things like that  So I used all of that stuff  To have mercy  You know  All the catchphrases  That I brought to the show  That's why I was pissed off  When the writers were  Trying to push  Into my mouth  And down my throat  Attitudes and words  That you never would  Yeah you never would have said  You play great characters  Where you're 
[02:54:00]  Always very nice  And always a very  Giving guy  But always one moment away  From smashing somebody  With a table  Like that's that great balance  Between just really be nice  To this guy  And he'll treat you very well  But if you go over the line  You're gonna get a fucking  Beating immediately  And to me  That was what  The character  You keep that in mind  Oh yeah  I'm very rarely nervous  To walk up to people  But I saw you outside  The comedy cellar  And I wanted to talk to you 
[02:54:30]  But it's like  You were talking to people  I was like  What am I gonna say  And then Joe  The guy you're acting with  Actually knew my act  A little bit  Joe Whistler  Joe Whistler  So we talked  He loves you  He's a big fan  Well you were in the  You were in the  You were in the  The bar  Getting a drink or whatever  So we started talking  For a while  And he goes  Hey can I  Can I take a photo with you  And I'm like  Yeah of course  And he goes  Oh you know  If you want to meet John  I'm like yeah I do  I guess he's kind of  Somebody fucking lurking  Like a creep  Like John Henkley  Just standing there  And he's like 
[02:55:00]  He doesn't really like  Taking pictures  I'm like do you think  You would take one with me  And he goes  Alright I'll ask him  I kind of you know  Bugged him and asked him  But do you just get  Have you gotten sick of it  Over the years  Like there's so many people  Asking for so many years  Well the attitude of the public  Has changed  Because you got people out there  That'll take your picture  And post it on eBay  Or sell it  I mean they're  Right  And I don't like that  I mean if you're going to do that  Send me a piece  You know  Yeah right  I mean take the picture  You're going to sell it  But break  Break Kunta off a little piece  You know  And then  But when people intrude on you 
[02:55:30]  When you're trying to have a  Like you're with your children  Yeah  Say it's Mother's Day  Or  Maybe you just had a root canal  Maybe you just don't feel like  Being bothered  And when they get so intrusive  That  You want to break something  Over their head  I said no  It's  You know  I better go home  And stay by myself  Until this attitude goes away  And everyone has cameras now  It's not like  Yeah that's it  There's no privacy  No more  Everybody has a camera  At any given moment  To say  Can I take a picture  So you would 
[02:56:00]  You would be constantly  Taking pictures  But he wasn't rude to people  Like people would walk by  And he would just go  I don't do pictures  But he would shake their hand  And talk to them  There was a couple guys  That stood there for five minutes  Just chatting  It wasn't  It didn't feel rude  Or dismissive  At least I have  At least I carry a camera  Like a true creep  And I don't ask people  With a cell phone  That's annoying  At least I'm ready  To take a real photo  Well you have a camera  You got some pictures here  That need signing  Just one photo  Of course  Now he needs a picture signed  I love that my photo  It's Jimmy though  It's a photo of us together  Jimmy's house is a museum 
[02:56:30]  Yeah it really is  It's amazing  It really is a soulless place  Everything  There's no true memories  It's just photos of me  With people  And it's just  It's empty of all good feeling  You know what it is  There's no future  There's just the past  In your place  It's everyone he's seen  And been with  And things he's done  But no future  Well it's very symbolic  Of let's say my career  Let's be honest  We're not exactly  On a rocket ship here guys  You're doing alright buddy  You got a lot of people  That love this stuff  And you know that 
[02:57:00]  Yeah  Let's give the play  A final plug  Yeah get the final plug  Man  Felony Friday  Felony Friday  It was of course  Starring John Amos  And it's tonight  At 7  30  730  And Thursday  At 930  And it's an amazing location  That's down at  115 McDougal Street  Between Café Wa  And the Comedy Cellar  It's West 30  And McDougal basically  And it's an amazing place  For a play  Every seat is good  It's not like you're  Getting it lost in there  And the number is  212-475-1449 
[02:57:30]  And I'm really  Really bothered  I have to fly today  Because I want to see  This very much  Oh man  So I hope you guys  Get more extended  Well if it's extended  We'll see you  I would love to  I hope you can make it  Because you're going to love it  Yeah I know  I wanted to go the other night  But I couldn't  I didn't want to get there  And see like the last 15 minutes  And fucking bumble into the door  As something really important  You know and the killer is  That I fucking walk in  And I wave at John  Hoping he sees me  You idiot  I love it  Exactly  He's the best  Just a fucking pariah  John thank you 
[02:58:00]  I mean I'm so happy  Thanks so much  Thank you  Huge fan over the years  I'll come back  And I'll do the Turk for you  Whenever your schedule allows  It runs about  How about tomorrow  No I'm gone  Next week  Yeah next week  No we'll have him back soon  And I have a  But it should happen  During football season  Particularly when guys  Get cut and traded  And whatever  You're gonna like it man  And I have a poem  I will do  I've never done it on this show  But it starts with  A man  And he was from Nantucket  I heard about it  It's a biography  Alright  Sirius XM 
[02:58:30]  The Virus  No  No  No  No  No  No 
[02:59:00]  No, no, no, no, yeah.  No, no, no, no, no, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Well, well, well, well, well, well, no, my health's just a lot.  No, my head doesn't allow it. 
[02:59:30]  Sirius XM, the virus.  The O.P. Anthony Show.  John Amos was really cool.  That was pretty fun and cool, man.  I didn't want to say in front of him, but that guy is 72 years old.  Holy shit.  He doesn't look 72 years old.  No, not at all.  You look at J.J. Walker there, he looks ancient. 
[03:00:00]  And he didn't want to answer the J.J. question.  He goes, I'll say this.  And he talked about Norman Lear.  Now they get along now.  I know.  I was going to bring it up again, and I'm like, I think he answered that question by not answering.  By not answering.  I think he hates J.J.  I think there's probably been issues there.  Well, we had issues with J.J. over the years.  J.J.'s a douche from what I remember, recall, from him.  But, yeah, the odd thing was, I think he was only like six or nine years older than Jimmy 
[03:00:30]  Walker.  And he's playing his father.  And meanwhile, on set, when the camera isn't rolling, you know, they had their problems.  And Esther Roll was 19 years older than him.  19 years older than him.  Than him.  Fuck.  That's amazing.  She would be 91 today.  Wow.  Jimmy Walker is eight years younger.  Eight years younger.  That was it.  So, James would have had to have had him at eight.  Jimmy Walker is 63. 
[03:01:00]  64.  64.  J.J. is 64.  J.J. is 64.  And John, there's 72.  I love how he's talking about it.  Just put on that chicken hat.  He'd put on his, because he worked down at the chicken place.  So, he'd come in the door with the chicken hat, and everybody would just go,  Wee!  Ah, dance!  That's because he's in the audience.  And he's like, he's a writer.  Because Mr. Amos is a little deeper.  He's a much deeper actor and person.  That shit probably drove him nuts. 
[03:01:30]  You know what it must have been like for him to stand there waiting to deliver a line  while J.J. went,  Dino Mike!  Like, again?  Right.  John Amos looked old during good times.  He looked older than J.J.  He looked like J.J.'s father.  And I'm sure not a lot of makeup used.  And then he just stopped aging from the good times years.  That was about it.  Fuck, what a great guy.  That's so cool, though.  That's a strong one, Jimmy.  Thank you for that.  Yeah, I was so happy.  Jimmy had him outside the cellar and set that whole fucking thing up.  What a, just a legendary, nice guy. 
[03:02:00]  Like, literally.  He's a TV icon.  There's nowhere he can go that everybody in the room would know.  He's just a very nice man.  And I wish I could see this play.  I'm really, I'm not even just saying that because he was here.  Like, I really wanted to see the play because the other actor was very cool.  It did sound like a good fucking play.  And that fucking space, man, that one, Spike Lee has done stuff there.  Teller's play was there.  It's an amazing small theater, like an off-Broadway theater for a play.  It's perfectly constructed. 
[03:02:30]  You know, there's no bad seats.  So I'm fucking annoyed I can't go.  What about the toilet?  But it's probably not good for the show.  Yeah, but when you walk in, the stage is at the other end of the room so you can go behind yourself to go to the bathroom.  It's not like you're strapped.  Oh!  I'm confused.  How long has this play been there?  I don't know.  Because I...  Is it a short run and they're hoping it does well and then they move it up town a little bit?  I think that's what happens a lot.  That's what happened with Colin, if you remember.  Yeah.  He started way down there and all of a sudden he's in the middle of fucking Broadway. 
[03:03:00]  Well, yeah, well, you know, yeah, hmm.  So I would assume this is going to move up town.  Up town!  Well, we're moving on up.  Oh, that's a different show.  That was so funny when you said that.  You said fucking Sherman Hemsley is the other guy that gets recognized a lot.  It's like two of the guys, the only two black dads on TV back in the entire 70s.  But literally, the most recognizable guy was Sherman because everywhere he fucking goes... 
[03:03:30]  I told you, homeless guys don't know this shit.  They know that motherfucker.  They would do the walk!  Do the walk!  They were yelling at him as he walked.  Like, every single person knew that fucking guy.  Were you there when we had him on that time at N.E.W.?  At N.E.W., probably.  We fucking had him on, man.  He rocked.  Yeah, he was good.  He called me recently.  I would love to have him on.  Oh!  Yeah, back then, when we were just hanging out on 57th Street waiting to do our afternoon  drive show, he walked by once and we're like, hey, man, you want to do our show?  And he came on. 
[03:04:00]  Yeah, yeah, he came on.  He came on.  Oh, I was watching Curb Your Enthusiasm last night.  Not the one with Michael J. Fox, because I was one behind, so I'm going to watch that  one today.  A couple behind.  But I was watching...  That's called Shake Your Enthusiasm.  Sorry.  I was watching the one with Bill Buckner.  You seen that one yet?  I haven't seen it yet.  Fucking funny as hell.  He's just walking around with Bill Buckner and constantly asking Bill Buckner, like,  how do you put up with this?  And he's like, well, you know...  And it's Bill Buckner.  Right.  He's like, well, you know, you got to just kind of go through it. 
[03:04:30]  Just roll with it?  And they're walking down the street and people are going, fuck you, Buckner, you piece of  shit!  And he's like...  And Larry David's yelling, like, hey, you...  He goes, no, it's okay.  I do this all the time.  Hey, you fucking couldn't catch a ball, you scumbag!  They're yelling at him.  I can't wait to see it.  It's hilarious.  And then some big fat idiot yells at him, too.  There was some big fat idiot that yelled at him.  Oh, I don't remember.  He goes, oh, yeah, Buckner, you dropped the ball or something. 
[03:05:00]  Did you see that?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  That big fat idiot.  Who was that fat idiot that just yelled at him?  It was so funny.  Oh, who was that fat fuck?  He got to yell at...  I'm taking it out of the bed.  He got to yell at Buckner?  Yeah, some fat idiot.  Yeah, I know.  Dude, you know...  You know what, dude?  Boom.  You do your little parts, dude.  You see what happens.  You know what, dude?  You can't control the outcome.  You know, he...  And you know...  He said they cut one of his lines, too.  Bobby had another line.  Yeah.  You know he loved doing that because he really wants to just say, fuck you. 
[03:05:30]  Wait, how many am I behind now?  Because I saw Rosie.  That was...  Yeah, it's Rosie.  It's Buckner.  And then Michael J. Fox.  You know what?  I finally saw Louis C.K.'s Afghanistan fucking hour.  Yeah, yeah.  Holy shit.  Isn't that fucking crazy?  That one should win a fucking Emmy, man.  Yeah, that one's fucking really good.  I wonder if it's going to be nominated next time around or whatever.  He totally bamboozled FX.  It's amazing what he did.  Yeah.  He went in on the first season under the guise that, hey, I'm a comedian.  I got a comedy show.  Sign me up.  And they're like, okay.  And then he puts on, you know, funny little vignettes for the first season. 
[03:06:00]  And then the second season, they go, okay, we're going to pick you up.  Go ahead.  And he goes, all right, this will be some of the downest, darkest shit you will ever  see on television.  Abbreviated every so often with some of my act, which is funny.  It's brilliant.  And that's pretty much what he's doing.  Really smart.  It's the darkest drama.  But that Afghanistan episode.  Yeah.  That should win something.  Holy fuck.  The little peeping fucking little chickadee that he's got to protect.  And the Chris Rock one.  Was that the season finale? 
[03:06:30]  Because I saw that yesterday, too.  I'm behind, too, on that one.  I'm a DV.  I just got one of them new fucking big-ass Verizon DVRs.  Yeah.  That, like, got the bigger hard drive.  It works so much faster, too.  It's great.  Love Fios.  I got to get Fios.  Louie has a fucking huge apartment.  Does he?  Really?  The Louie C.K. money's rolling in now?  Oh, that Louie money's fucking buying some Manhattan real estate.  He had a little birthday get-together.  It was very few.  It was only five people.  A get-together. 
[03:07:00]  It was, you know, some couple of celebrities.  I don't know.  I bet.  So Jimmy Norton was there.  Yeah.  So then who else?  Who cares?  Doesn't matter.  Well, just, I know no one cares.  Yeah.  But just to, just so you don't forget.  Right.  It's best to say things aloud so you don't forget.  Nick DiPaolo was there.  Nick DiPaolo.  I like Nick.  Bobby Kelly.  Oh, Bobby.  Todd Barry stopped by.  There's like six people.  Todd Barry.  Very good.  And Artie Lang was there.  Artie.  Artie.  Good.  Chris Rock.  Chris Rock.  Wait, there's more than five people there.  Bobby Cannavale. 
[03:07:30]  Bobby, right?  Of course.  We're pushing close to ten people.  I might have been seven, but I left.  I only stayed for a while because I had to get up.  Nice.  Aw.  Bobby Cannavale's an amazing actor.  Yeah.  He's in Chris's play.  He's fucking great, man.  Yeah.  The motherfucker.  That must have been fun.  The motherfucker in the hat.  The motherfucker in the hat.  That was so good.  Were you ready to say the mother-hucker in the hat?  Yeah, yeah.  Did you almost say the mother-hucker?  Or it might have been motherfucker with hat and I was fucking up the age.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  That was such a fucking good play, man.  Yeah.  Yeah, with the Afghanistan fucking episode.  Holy fuck. 
[03:08:00]  Yeah, that's a good one.  God damn it.  He's good at that.  It's a quirky thing that he's doing.  It's very quirky.  I don't think it's quirky at all.  I think it's very quirky.  Why?  I don't think, because I don't think anyone else could pull it off but him.  Like, this isn't something you can write for somebody else.  It's really got to be Louie.  Well, that's why it's working.  He told the effects, I will deliver you a fucking show.  Leave me the fuck alone.  There's other guys out there that probably could, you know, pull off something.  I'm not saying pull off what Louie's know, but pull off their own thing. 
[03:08:30]  But, like, Jimmy knows all the executives and everyone gets in the fucking way.  Louie figured it out.  Here's what Louie's.  If you want me to do a show, because he told them no a million times, I will deliver a show.  Leave me alone.  Louie gets a lot of, has had a lot of shows go to air, or pilots, because Louie's such  a fucking, I was thinking about it last night as he was talking.  He was talking about this comedian, Teddy Bergeron.  He's such, he must be a fucking monster in a pitch meeting, because he's such an interesting  dude.  Yeah, yeah, yeah. 
[03:09:00]  Like, when you, when you, you listen to it, he can describe anything and make it sound  interesting, which is why he tells great stories.  Yeah.  Because he knows how to get to the point.  He knows how to keep it funny and interesting.  He knows how to make people understand what the fuck he's talking about, also.  He has a great, I've pitched my show a few times, and I literally had to leave episodes,  because I'm like, I don't know how to pitch.  It's hard.  What's it about?  All right, it's me.  I've got shoes.  And I like to have gum with my eyes. 
[03:09:30]  It sounds fantastic, Mr. Dorkin.  I literally, I almost ripped up the paper, my pitch was so bad.  It's very fucking hard.  Can't you have someone else pitch it for you?  No, you have, because you're selling yourself, really.  But with your, I know, but you're there.  Well, Jonathan helps, and David helps.  Yeah.  David?  David.  But Louis had the, you know, he has the ability to do all that stuff.  He can direct, he can write, and he edits, he does everything himself, and they don't  need to hire a bunch of people, there's no cast. 
[03:10:00]  Yeah.  He's fucking, he's just, he's got balls, man.  All that money can go to Louis.  Fucking balls.  He can get a nice apartment in the sky in New York.  It's not nearly the amount of money he could be making.  No, that's true.  Does he step behind the camera sometimes?  Oh, all the time.  Because the Afghanistan, I don't know Louis that well, I mean, just from the show, but  I have a, he's queer.  I have a feeling that he, those shots were absolutely his, and possibly him, you know,  shooting some of that shit.  Oh, dude, we, we, when we did the one.  I just had a strong feeling on that one.  The discussion about gays and stuff, and that one, Louis was telling the guy with the camera 
[03:10:30]  where to go, he's like, no, no, I want this angle.  He was, he was directing the shots.  Yeah.  He knows what he wants.  Yeah, he loves his cameras.  Like, hey, cameraman.  I'm the director.  No.  Hey, cameraman.  Yeah.  You listen to me.  He knows what he wants, and he's right, he's very confident in what he wants, and  he's not afraid to hurt someone's feelings by telling him, that's not what I want.  Yeah, that's a, that's a huge thing.  Also, Louis doesn't seem like the kind of guy that's afraid to, um, have, have to walk  away from the situation.  No, he almost has Asperger's.  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah, but he's a great host, by the way.  I forgot what a, like, I haven't seen Louis socially in so long, it's always been here, 
[03:11:00]  where we're on the set, I've never seen, it's been a year since I've seen him socially.  He's a great host.  For the people that have seen all the episodes, have you seen all the episodes?  You're one behind.  I have, of what, Louis?  I've never seen one.  I've been arguing this point, I really think Pam, the love interest sort of in Louis C.K.,  that she really does like Lou.  Maybe.  I've got to see all the episodes, I guess, so maybe we'll talk about this in another  week or so.  I've never seen, I won't watch it, because I'm right.  She gets the impression, like, I'm not attracted to you whatsoever, you've got to move on with 
[03:11:30]  your life, but I'm thinking that she is, but she's broken and doesn't understand, you  know, how to feel the love.  Could be.  And I wonder if Louis is going that deep with it, or is it just what it is?  It's like, she just has no attraction to them.  I don't know.  And the interaction with the kids are great.  It's not like this dumb cutesy thing that they're trying to do, like in a sitcom with  kids.  That's why I'm saying it's not so much quirky, maybe that's the wrong word to use, but it's  so different than a sitcom or a drama or a dramedy or whatever the fuck you want to 
[03:12:00]  call it.  It doesn't fit into any of those categories.  It's just weird.  It starts, you go through a segment, they'll go to commercial, they'll come back, whether  that segment is even relevant anymore, or he moves on to something else, or kind of overlaps  into something else.  So it's very not like anything you're watching.  He's making his own rules.  He really is.  He's breaking the law, breaking the law.  And Jimmy, has he depicted the life of a comedian?  I've never seen it. 
[03:12:30]  What?  He hasn't seen Louis.  Why?  I haven't watched one episode.  I was just telling you that.  Because he writes.  Because I'm writing something, so I love, Louis, I'm afraid of the influence.  Where was I when he said that?  I said it here.  I was like, where was I?  You're right here.  Where was I?  No, where was I?  I know I'm here physically.  Yeah.  But I did not hear that.  Oh, yeah, no, I love Louis.  And I literally...  Your eyes rolled back in your head for a second.  You didn't even see the first season?  I haven't seen the episodes I was in.  I saw a moment of the Rick Crome scene.  Yeah.  And I stopped because I love Louis' writing, and his writing is so concise and funny, I do 
[03:13:00]  not want to be influenced by what he's doing.  And that's the only reason.  It's because I know when you're seeing somebody do something fucking original, it's so tempting.  Right.  That's why I don't watch comedians.  Because I want to know that whatever I have, I know exactly where it fucking came from.  Yeah.  Do you know what I mean?  It's like, Louis, how could you not want to do what he's doing?  That's an original.  You watch and go like, oh, well, you know, it wouldn't be exactly the same.  Yeah, that's why I try to avoid that. 
[03:13:30]  And that's why sitcoms, to me, are so terrible, because so many of them are just copying,  like, this is a comic copy of Seinfeld, which is, this is that, and this is that.  And it's like, people should just fucking live their life and write about it.  There is one comic you do watch, you know that.  Who's that?  Yakov Schmierdorf.  I do love Yakov.  Well, you know what?  If you make your way down to Branson, Missouri, my friend, you will pick up some material.  You study him.  By the way, can I say this?  Oh, literal Bob.  What happened?  The text I got.  From Bob Kelly?  Yeah.  What did he say?  What did he say?  He mentioned John Amos' interview. 
[03:14:00]  I said he, and I wrote, he was great.  And Bob wrote back, he was.  And then a minute later, he writes, it was me, you cunt.  No.  Oh, God.  Bobby.  No, come on.  Bobby.  Yelling at Buckner.  What are you doing?  No, he wouldn't do that.  He wrote, it was me.  No, he wouldn't do that.  Yeah.  Oh, literal Bob.  No, he wouldn't do that.  No.  Hold on.  Amon Gert hairdo is asking something.  Don't move that.  Why?  What's wrong? 
[03:14:30]  Yakov Smirnoff presents Dynamite Entertainment.  I guess he has his own theater down there.  Yeah.  Booking Muslim comedians.  Dude, I'm not kidding you.  There is something called the Brady Brunch.  Nice.  It's a Brady Brunch with Barry Williams.  Click here for the, to see Showtime.  Oh, leave Barry alone.  He's an old friend of ours.  The Brady Brunch.  Leave him alone.  Oh, he's doing it with Asian actors.  That's why.  The Brady Brunch is proud to, Yakov is proud to announce that in August, the Brady Brunch 
[03:15:00]  star Barry Williams is going to debut live production Brady Brunch.  The multi-talented Williams will perform a limited engagement in August 2nd to the 14th.  Boy, that is limited.  At Yakov's Branson, Missouri Theater.  The one-man show with a live band has been created specifically for the memory lane with  an intimate portrait of Williams' life and a montage of the Brady Bunch phenomenon.  Williams' incredible showmanship and seemingly endless talent has given him enormous success 
[03:15:30]  as an actor and performer.  Now, he's bringing that talent to Branson.  God love him.  She was bringing it to Brainerd as he was driving past the cop car.  It's, if the show weren't enough, your experience will be topped off with a gourmet brunch served  to you on a golden platter with linen napkins, real silverware prepared for you by Yakov, his 
[03:16:00]  personal chef.  If you remember, the golden platters was the name of the Brady's band when they were trying  to win the band contest to buy a gift.  They were trying to buy the golden platters.  What? You're still reading?  Yeah, yeah.  As a matter of fact.  The iconic actor, I know, this is like they're fucking...  I heard something about platters.  What's that about now?  Writing about De Niro's career here.  Yeah.  The iconic actor recently received rave reviews as Oscar in The Odd Couple at the Alhambra Theater 
[03:16:30]  in Jacksonville, Florida.  So he was in The Odd Couple in Jacksonville, Florida.  What happened?  Uh, isn't that close to where Iraq was born and raised?  Yeah.  Jacksonville?  Same state.  Same state, right?  And here's Tampa.  Oh, Tampa, right, right.  Is your mic on, Sam?  No.  Yeah, I don't know why.  It's weird.  In 2008.  Oh, my God.  Oh, growing up Brady, this, that.  Wow.  A Brady brunch. 
[03:17:00]  And there's the schedule.  Roll that down a little bit.  Let me see.  Schedule's over.  10.30 a.m. and then 12.30 on the last Saturday.  Oh, oh, wait a minute.  You could still do this?  Has it been extended through October, November, and December?  Oh, thank God.  Brady brunch Christmas?  A Brady brunch Christmas?  Yeah.  Shit.  Hey.  How many fucking years has it been?  Before we go.  Get up already.  Yeah.  Troy Kwan said that we dress shitty.  He did.  And because of that, I wanted to wear sweatpants today and I wore jeans. 
[03:17:30]  He influenced me on my dress today.  Wait a minute.  He influenced me on my fucking dress today.  When did he say we dress shitty?  Yesterday during the shit show.  Yeah, after I was done spending 20 minutes talking about how much you liked the 10 o'clock  hour.  We moved on to Troy.  I was asking him about the argument that he got into with you guys about hipster and everything.  Yeah.  Yeah.  And he stated that you guys had no business discussing anyone's fashion.  He said, you know, you guys are the greatest at radio, but in terms of dressing yourselves. 
[03:18:00]  Here's my point, Sam.  I mean, I, we don't need the long winded explanation.  Yes, exactly.  We are technically 10 o'clock.  We are technically hipsters because we don't fucking think about what we're fucking dressing  like.  That's, that's what Jimmy's whole point yesterday.  Let me tell you that proves that as a hipster, he's overthinking it and making sure everything  is, is hipster.  Yeah.  What time?  So if I wear sweatpants and a college shirt, I'm a, I'm a fucking hipster.  You're a hipster.  Cause I'm not thinking about it.  What time does Troy Kwan get up to do his hair, get, pick out the right clothes to come 
[03:18:30]  to fucking work at the radio station.  Here's when I might decide I'm going to dress up in my fucking, uh, uh, uh, uh, Joseph Abood  suits or my fucking, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, Armani suits.  You sound like Jay-Z drop.  When I fucking go out, that's right, motherfucker.  You're right, nigga.  I dress like a motherfucker when I go out.  In person.  I dress up when I go out. 
[03:19:00]  I look like a thousand million dollars.  That's a billion dollars.  I know it's a billion dollars.  A thousand million.  And let me tell you something.  Nice.  Fuck Troy Kwan and his hipster put together, uh, trying too hard at work to look good.  I come in to be comfortable so I could sit here and do my job, which is talk for four  hours and attempt to be entertaining.  And there's not a gal in sight.  Yeah.  There's not even a gal in sight, Troy Kwan.  Oh, there was a gal in sight.  He chased her away, the fag, because, uh, remember? 
[03:19:30]  Because her black ass was on his fucking arm.  And she just wanted money.  And then, fuck that shit.  Yeah, we're, we're, we're dressing for all the guys.  Yeah.  Troy Kwan.  Ah, here he is.  I do.  Hold on, hold on.  I do want to say that I do not have sweatpants on today because of you.  So you did influence.  I'm wearing sweatpants.  I'm actually wearing sweatpants because of you.  With the Sialis hard on, Jimmy.  That's what makes you a hipster.  I don't have a Sialis.  You should have worn sweatpants.  What?  You should have worn swim pants today.  Swim pants?  Sweatpants.  Why would you care what Troy Kwan says about your, your dress? 
[03:20:00]  Oh, I don't.  I was just fucking around.  He does look good.  That was sort of a technical humor.  You have a t-shirt on and jeans.  Yeah.  What's the problem?  All right.  There's no problem.  But I'm not criticizing you as I wear a t-shirt and jeans.  I have an over thing because, you know, certain things I got to fucking make sure don't  get seen.  Let me show you my, all right, all right, let me show you my hipster shoe.  That's not a hipster shoe.  That is a hipster shoe.  Is that one of those supposed to work out while you walk shoes?  Oh, no, Nana.  What are you doing?  It looks like, the sole is so big, it looks like a, it looks like a, it looks like a corrective  shoe.  Yeah, it's great. 
[03:20:30]  Shape ups?  Is that a shape up?  Do you wear shape ups?  Do you wear a shape up?  I was wearing shape ups way before the fucking commercials hit TV.  You should spray paint those white and go to a hospital and walk around smothering the elderly.  That was a fucking horrible.  What are you doing?  Are you bringing bedpans to old people?  What's wrong with this?  What's right about them?  I do a lot of walking and if you have a heel, it makes you tired.  Cool.  So if you have this little curve here where the heel should be, it keeps you going like  this.  You're standing on a rocking horse.  Yes.  No.  Are these hipsters?  What time are you and Buzz getting off the ship? 
[03:21:00]  That's almost like hiking shoes.  They're close between hiking shoes and nurse shoes.  That's like outdoorsy.  That's not hipsters.  What's that?  Me and William Shatner had a nice, uh, we related because he had MBTs around your wife  in a pool.  Oh, wait a minute.  He didn't do it.  He is 81 or whatever.  What, what, what, MBTs?  MBTs.  Look.  That's not hipster.  Look, watch.  Exactly.  Shoes shouldn't move.  They go back and forth.  It is.  It's like a rocking horse.  Yeah.  You're like Alex hitting that fucking plastic dick in clockwork. 
[03:21:30]  That's how the plastic dick moved.  Right.  And it was just dropping Armani and a boot and all this and you're dropping MBTs.  Dropping MBTs right now.  That's how I dress when I put on a suit.  That's how my shoes roll.  When I'm going out to events, occasions, affairs.  When I'm out on the town, not on the town.  Well.  I'm wearing the best of the best of the best suits.  Troy.  And that's something that Sam also forgot to tell you guys that I said yesterday.  No.  Opie.  Opie said he heard it.  Troy.  My point is very, very simple.  If, if we just like shit.  And I think that's what you basically said yesterday. 
[03:22:00]  Aren't we being hipsters?  I wouldn't, I wouldn't say that.  Aren't we being hipsters if you think about it?  Because we're not really caring if, if we're, if we're looking like, uh, rock guys or looking  like nerds or, or, or, or, or, or looking like preppy guys.  Aren't we technically hipsters?  Because we're really not thinking about it at all.  But then how are you going to criticize those guys?  Because they're overly thinking about it.  Because they, because the intent is there to dress a certain way.  I don't think about it in the morning when I get dressed.  Make you believe you're not trying. 
[03:22:30]  I look like shit.  We're officially not trying with our dress.  Legitimately not trying, yes.  So I think officially we are hipsters.  Yep.  But, but they're the anti-whatever is going on right now anyway.  No, they're not anti when so many people are doing it.  Which is, which is, then it becomes the norm.  Why is that so good?  Shut up.  Why would you say that what you're wearing now is any better than what anyone else in  this place is wearing right now?  Jimmy Norton is wearing a t-shirt and something covering his legs.  You're wearing a t-shirt, something covering your legs. 
[03:23:00]  Because I don't criticize what other people are wearing.  Oh, you did yesterday?  You criticized E-Rogg's?  Because we were talking about it on the air.  What?  What?  Put your foot on the table.  Let me see what kind of shoe you're wearing.  My MBTs are more hip than your fucking shoe.  Oh, boy.  No, they're not.  Look at these babies, Sam.  No, they're not.  His are maroon colored.  Yeah, that's why mine are hip.  Someone pointed out I got seesaw shoes.  Yours, the top of yours looks like a hiking boot.  Nice, right?  So you could walk around and people wouldn't even look at that.  The top of his looks like a fruit roll-up. 
[03:23:30]  So that, obviously, people would look at it because it's hip.  Troy?  Why?  Because his shoes are cool.  I'm rocking the MBTs.  I got Vance.  What he's covering his legs with is crisp denim.  I got Pia Flyers.  Hey, if you're a hipster, you should know brands.  I didn't say I was a hipster.  You're the one that keeps calling me a hipster.  Everyone around here calls you a hipster.  Well, that's fine, but I don't think I am.  I think hipsters don't know brands.  You said, I got Vance.  Yeah, I got Vance.  They're skate shoes.  That's what's up.  Do you skate? 
[03:24:00]  Yeah, absolutely.  Good?  I got rocks.  You got shoes.  Beat that.  For a 34-year-old.  I hope nobody heard that.  Listen to this asshole.  He sits around watching wrestling.  You know what I mean?  He does.  You're right on that.  But you know what?  Sitting around watching wrestling has gotten him sitting here after our show on the shit  show with wrestlers to interview.  Now, whether some people like that or not is one thing.  Nobody likes it.  But he does bring wrestlers in here.  That's right.  And it was part of his dream growing up. 
[03:24:30]  Fair enough.  Now, how many skaters do you talk to on a daily basis on the air?  No, skaters, but I stay physically active and I, uh...  There are other ways, you know, of staying physically active.  So why can't I skate?  I can't beat him up.  You can't.  I'm not saying skating's bad.  I'm just saying it's no better than this little kid watching fucking wrestling.  I can't beat him up.  He's in his 30s.  He's skating.  I'm, like, pushing 40 now, and I like a bike ride.  You're pushing 40?  Pushing pretty hard.  What a scumbag.  He truly is a scumbag.  Dude, my MBTs are fucking hip because no one is wearing these bigs. 
[03:25:00]  There's a reason no one's wearing them.  That's right.  The definition of fucking not caring.  I don't know.  There's something...  What do you got?  Let me see.  Something with an N on it, and they're black.  New Balance?  I don't know what they're on.  End shoes.  End shoes.  Yeah, New Balance.  End shoes.  Yeah.  Yeah.  New Balance?  I have no idea.  Yeah.  I don't even know.  I usually wear 5'11 gear.  I got my Chuck T's on.  What?  Chuck T's.  Let's see.  Let me see.  See, I got those.  The fucking, yeah.  Up the ankles.  Everyone put their foot on the fucking table.  Minor custom. 
[03:25:30]  All right, yeah.  Go ahead, Troy.  From least hip to hippest with the shoes.  Not counting yourself, because you know.  Who's least hip?  Who's least hip?  And let's move right up the chain.  Troy, keep in mind that...  Hold on.  Let's go around the room.  Jimmy, what are you wearing there today?  I didn't even vote me as being least hip.  Nike work shoes.  Nice.  But they're Nike.  I have bad feet, though.  I would say mine are the least hip.  New Balance?  Yeah.  Well, they're just, they're very plain.  They're just plain black.  Yeah.  But they're probably very comfortable.  They're very comfortable. 
[03:26:00]  That's why I wear them.  Fashion over functionality.  But you also have to take into consideration my brown dress socks that I wear with them.  Now that's fucking hip.  That's the most uncomfortable material ever.  No, they're so comfortable.  I can't wear white anymore.  No, your white sweat sock or shit.  Nope.  Nice, thin dress socks on any shoe.  They don't breathe.  What are you, a fucking European tourist?  Do you have a camera and sandals?  They don't breathe.  No, they do.  They don't breathe.  You gotta get the good ones.  I spend big money on dress socks.  Big money! 
[03:26:30]  Steven from Bayshore says I pushed 40 off a cliff.  Well, thanks for that, Steven.  You've been pushing 40 for quite a while.  Yeah, you push 40 so hard, you can't even push back or nothing.  Oh, Chip!  Oh, you're precocious.  It was John Amos.  I was gonna go, what are you, having good times or something?  He'd have laughed.  Troy's jealous of my MPTs.  I see how he's looking at them.  You want to try these?  I don't know, man.  I mean, if they're comfortable, cool.  I don't know if I'd rock those, but, you know, if you rock them, you can.  I'd rather wear a Japanese woman's shoes made of fucking blocks. 
[03:27:00]  All bound up.  Hey, is this true?  Yes.  Troy?  It has to be.  Troy Kwan spins the hokey pokey for eight-year-olds at the roller rink.  You do that shit?  Is that what you're doing when you're DJing?  That is true, yes.  Oh, my God.  That's embarrassing.  Some people assume that that's what you do when you're DJing.  Look, I did one roller skating gig.  I feel for you.  Yeah, it's not fun.  Wow.  I'd rather be out of the rink.  I would love to spin that for them.  And you shake it all about.  Try to find a girl named hokey. 
[03:27:30]  You take your dingle out and you shake it all about.  You do it a hokey kissy.  Kissy.  Kissy.  I know.  I did say you guys cleaned up well for TV.  Just so you know.  He did say you look good on, like, Letterman and Letterman and stuff.  Yeah.  Thanks.  You guys can pull it together when you need to.  I don't need to pull it together for nobody.  It happens.  Yeah.  I got it.  I haven't bought a fucking piece of clothing in three years.  You should.  I don't feel like it.  I have a closet full of the best.  The best. 
[03:28:00]  Oh, I love this song.  You want to play it?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  What is it?  It's been around for a while.  I'm not saying it's something new.  But it's a whole song about fucking hipster dickheads.  I want to thank somebody today.  You're welcome.  Oh, it's fantastic.  I've heard this before, but they did just send it in.  Get it on the YouTube.  Let's end with Sam.  Get it on the YouTube.  Hold on.  Ethan BG on Twitter.  Thank you for sending in the dickhead song.  If we're going to end with a hipster dickhead song.  Can I whore my fucking...  Yes, whore yourself. 
[03:28:30]  I'll be on Leno tomorrow and Friday.  Jay?  Yes.  All right.  I'm doing just a little segment Friday and then G4 Network Thursday and Attack of the  Show and Tampa Improv the 29th of September through the 1st of October.  I'm going to be on Tony Leno's podcast later this week, so my career has taken off as well.  There's no guy named Tony Leno.  By the way, my phone's in bored are fixed from when a beer spilt into them all over my  Labor Day party.  Your phone is bored.  Well, stop talking about sleeping to it or something. 
[03:29:00]  That's a good one, Chip.  Oh, boy.  You are incorrigible.  Yeah.  Well, I don't want to go to incorrigible.  I want to go in somewhere like Hawaii or something.  I should be in Honolulu.  He's on a roll.  Yeah, I know I am.  If I was on a roll, though, you'd be going, get off that roll.  We want to put butter on it or something.  We've got a meeting we have to get to.  Hey, your shoe's got like a little maroon or something.  I really can't be at that meeting.  Too bad he doesn't have seven of those shoes.  He could have like a rock hoop on his feet or something.  I have a Barry, urgent Barry Shapiro meeting about my taxes. 
[03:29:30]  Player!  Oh, no, I do.  I actually had my taxes.  I had an extension done.  Really?  Yeah.  Did it make them longer?  Why would you want longer taxes?  You just keep saying it.  I'll just keep.  All right.  Can we play the dickhead song?  Yeah.  Please play it.  I want to hear this.  Okay.  And then.  Wait a second.  You know, we'll be back.  Dude, why are people laughing at me?  MBTs are fucking hip because no one's wearing them. 
[03:30:00]  Yeah.  That's what makes them hip.  Well, there's a lot of things.  They are wearing them.  But like if I was walking around with plastic bags on my feet, nobody's wearing them.  I would consider you a hipster.  The homeless would consider you.  I would consider you a true hipster if you did that.  All right.  I mean, I'm probably still warm.  As long as it didn't look like you were trying to do that.  Exactly.  Should I play the dickhead song?  Yes, something.  Troy, thanks, brother.  For all you do.  Wow.  For all you do.  He does have some crisp denim on.  You got to give him that.  He does have some crisp denim.  I'll always give him that one. 
[03:30:30]  Crisp, tight denim.  I don't spend a lot of time doing my hair.  I told you that.  I just wake up and I go.  That's bullshit.  You don't shower in the morning?  I wash my hair maybe like once a week.  I'd be a greasy mess if I didn't fucking shower every day.  What a doodle.  And wash the goddamn hair.  Greasy.  Let's love it.  It's so greasy.  You look like you were in a diner or something making eggs.  Like some kind of a...  It's not what I'm saying.  Oh, I was going to try to help you.  I don't need help.  Why don't you take your green shirt or something and make it... 
[03:31:00]  Because it's got envy.  It's green with envy.  Anytime Chip sees something that's green, he makes a reference to green with envy.  Don't talk about me like I'm not here.  I'm right here.  Well, Chip, you just use the envy joke a lot.  So what?  All right.  Dickhead song time.  Yeah.  See you tomorrow.  Hipster song.  It's about hipsters or something.  Oh, we're going over there?  Yeah.  All right.  Start over.  This is for all the hipsters out there.  Try it.  Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.  Got on the train from Cambridge, here. 
[03:31:30]  Moved down to an East London flat.  Got a mustache and a low-cut vest.  Some purple leggings and a sailor tat.  Just one gear on my fix-it bike.  Got a plus one here for my gig tonight.  I play sick.  You play sick.  2020 vision, just a pair of empty frames.  Dressing like a nut, although I never caught the grades.  I remember when the kids at school would call me names. 
[03:32:00]  Now we're taking over their estates.  Well, the world of my life is a dickhead.  All my friends are dickheads, too.  Come with me, let's be dickheads.  Come with me, let's be dickheads.  Be in a dickhead school.  Be in a dickhead school.  Be in a dickhead school.  Be in a dickhead school.  Cool, cool, cool.  Polaroid app on my iPhone. 
[03:32:30]  Taking pictures on London fields.  Up on the blog so everyone knows.  We're having new age fun.  We're in the vintage field.  Coolest kids in a warehouse rave.  Exclusivest look.  There's my name.  I got it.  You couldn't get it.  Never bought a pack of facts.  I only wrote my own.  Lugging in my laptop with the Starbucks on the road. 
[03:33:00]  Say I rock in media, I'm really on the dole.  I'm the coolest guy I'll ever know.  Whoa, whoa, whoa.  The love of my life is a dickhead.  All my friends are dickheads, too.  Come with me, let's be dickhead.  Savage, you're fine.  We'll be in a dickhead school.  We'll be in a dickhead school.  We'll be in a dickhead school.  We'll be in a dickhead school.  Cool, cool, cool, cool. 
[03:33:30]  Luggets with no sauce.  Electropop meets southern hip-hop.  Indeterminate sexual preference.  It's something retro on my necklace.  Basically, I'm a part-time blogger,  and I design my own jewellery line.  It's like a mix of religious iconography,  kind of with a save-by-the-bell vibe.  I organise a vegan cram night.  Yeah, I'm currently running my own magazine,  and it's all about my walls.  We're putting on this rave,  and this abandoned mosque, 
[03:34:00]  and all the proceeds are going to that thing  that happens in the Middle East,  or Africa, or whatever.  The virus.  Sirius XM.  Hey, hey, hey!  And now, the Opie and Anthony show continues.  This is After ONA Live.  Here's your host, Sam Roberts.  You bet it is!  It's After Opie and Anthony Live.  The guy just said it.  What's Club Soda Kenny doing out there?  Club Soda Kenny, he's right there in the hallway. 
[03:34:30]  I guess Opie must have gone to a meeting.  Everybody's gone.  Is he coming back?  Come on in!  Come on in!  Jim's bag is still there.  I'm sure Anthony left.  Club Soda Kenny,  what leaves you at the Sirius XM compound today?  Club Soda Kenny on Facebook.  Understood.  So, Club Soda Kenny,  what leaves you at the Sirius XM compound today?  Well, I think there's a meeting going on, 
[03:35:00]  so I'm standing by for transportation.  But you don't know,  is there a meeting going on,  or do you think there's a meeting going on?  Well, I'm trying to find out the details.  Well, where's...  He left.  Ant's gone.  Where's Opie?  Well, I don't know,  because I'm here answering silly questions.  Do people like to hear your voice, Kenny?  People tune in to After Opie and Anthony Live,  they like your phone calls,  they like it even better when you're still here.  You're not here that often. 
[03:35:30]  Nobody likes my voice.  All they do is mock my voice.  Here's the thing.  I'm a joke.  Yeah, but it's a comedy show,  so it works.  You know what I mean?  That's a good thing.  No, you're not going to set me up  like you set Troy up  to get into trouble.  But Troy's a hipster, though.  Nobody set Troy up.  I mean, you can go back  and listen to the tape.  I didn't...  I try...  I'm not going to say anything bad  about anybody.  That's what you're trying to do.  I'm not asking you to say anything bad  about anybody.  I'm asking you why you're here 
[03:36:00]  and you won't give me a straight answer.  I just said people like you.  People don't like me.  They tolerate me.  No, everybody likes you very much.  I mean, and everybody's excited  that your voice is live in the studio.  It's usually on the phone here on this show.  Yeah, not one phone is ringing,  so how excited could be people?  Do you need people to call up  and compliment you right now?  You seem bummed out.  All they should call is call Troy a hippie.  866-WOW-1-WOW. 
[03:36:30]  We're still on the...  I mean, the phones are open,  but people know the phone numbers.  What are you bummed out about today?  No, I'm right in the middle of something.  What are you in the middle of?  Trying to find out about the meeting.  You're on the air.  Hello?  Hello, who's this?  David from Israel.  David from Israel?  Who would have thought?  It's David from Israel, Kenny.  Yeah, I'm a Jew.  So what's your point?  I don't like hearing your voice. 
[03:37:00]  I love it!  Did you hear that?  And that's David from Israel.  He's a phone celebrity.  Look at the phones right now.  Another line, another line, another line.  Do you believe yet that people are fond of you?  Kenny, it's the stuff you say  and how you say it  that we like listening to you.  Cheer up a bit.  All right.  Sam, tell people,  I don't even have my headphones on,  so I can't even hear people.  Are you going to put them on or no?  No, I'm trying to text.  Who are you texting? 
[03:37:30]  G.H.  Well, Coke Logic wants to talk to you.  What's up, buddy?  Oh, wait.  It didn't click.  It didn't click.  You ready?  Wait, no.  Coke Logic, I have to listen to.  I'm hearing you.  Coke Logic gets respect.  Well, Coke Logic is another phone celebrity.  These are the guys who,  they're phone celebrities  because not just because of how often they get through,  but because of their timing.  Like, the first two calls up on the phone lines  are David from Israel and Coke Logic  because they know what they're doing.  Now, you know,  and now nobody's getting through. 
[03:38:00]  David called because I'm a Jew  and Coke Logic called  because he did my cartoon on my profile  from my Facebook.  A lot of people don't know that.  How are you doing?  I had a great time doing it  because you're a fantastic person, Kenny.  I like hearing you on the radio.  You see that?  I like hearing your stories.  No, I always enjoy when I come to Chicago  and you visit.  Absolutely.  Coke Logic, didn't you enjoy the other day,  last week,  when Kenny was telling his stories from his vacation? 
[03:38:30]  Yeah.  See?  Everybody loves you.  What was one story?  Oh, boy.  Oh, boy.  You were on a cruise.  See?  He was listening.  You were on a cruise.  That's where he found the old lady that was dying.  Right, Coke Logic?  Yeah.  See?  He remembers.  You want to talk to Mars?  I like when Kenny watches old movies  and then he tells stories about the movies that he watched 
[03:39:00]  that aren't his life.  Don't you have a coloring book you got to fill in?  Thank you, Coke Logic.  Hey, go paint by number.  He draws pictures of you, for God's sake.  For free.  He's an artist.  He should be commissioning you.  I know.  I just made two jokes at his expense.  I know.  I don't understand why.  What do you want to talk to Mars about, Kenny?  No, he's craving for attention.  I am not.  It's all about you.  Yeah, it's all about you, man.  What's up with you? 
[03:39:30]  Why would you take a shot of Mars?  He's just sitting there.  No, I was defusing.  Defusing what?  You're just building more attention.  Why are you looking at Roland when you're talking to me?  I'm not looking at Roland.  If you want to talk to him, talk to him.  You're defusing again.  I'm looking directly at you.  No, I've deflected that time.  There's a difference.  How's the traffic?  Oh, I'm here.  How should I know?  You usually get the traffic reports.  I'm in a building.  Did you know?  Somebody liked my line, though, on Facebook. 
[03:40:00]  What line?  When, like, you asked me, like, when I gave my last traffic report, and you said, well,  how's the traffic everywhere else?  I'm going, like, how should I know?  You know, I'm here.  I know where I am.  Like, good for you wherever you are.  But you don't remember the actual line that they liked.  Go to my Facebook page.  It's quoted there by somebody.  Somebody liked it.  Listen, today...  Yeah, and tomorrow's tomorrow.  I didn't say what today was. 
[03:40:30]  All right.  Today was a very important day.  Why?  Because, I'm glad you asked me that, Club Soda Kenny, because today was the first day  of the new Opie and Anthony intern.  We haven't had interns.  Oh, can I say his name?  Of course.  Sal.  He's a nice fella.  Is he good?  He's a nice fella.  How do you think?  Because we haven't had interns in nine months.  Who's counting?  I am.  I just said nine.  Obviously, I counted it.  Can we talk about something interesting? 
[03:41:00]  Why'd you bring him up?  What do you want to talk about?  I don't know.  So then, what are you doing?  Let's talk about my Facebook page.  Look, if you want to unfriend Kenny, just go to Club Soda Kenny on Facebook.  No, no.  Why would you be negative like that?  Because...  You gotta be positive.  All you want to do is plug your dumb Facebook page that you don't even really update that  often.  And when you do, it just links to someone else's stuff.  No, I did a status update yesterday.  What was it? 
[03:41:30]  This is what I wrote.  I am going to the gymnasium.  That's interesting.  You're telling me I'm bringing up boring stuff by talking about the new intern.  And what's interesting is you're going to the gymnasium.  That's interesting.  Let's bring Eric into the mix.  Eric?  Put your sandwich down.  Yeah.  Kenny wants you brought...  Shut up, Cyclops.  What's up?  Kenny wants you brought into the mix.  Hi, Eric.  Hi, Kenny.  Club Soda Kenny on Facebook.  Thank you, Eric.  You're very welcome.  What did you want to mix it up with him about? 
[03:42:00]  I don't even know what...  Sal, the intern.  Eric is his boss.  Yeah?  Yeah, that's what I heard.  So what?  You didn't even want to talk about the intern a minute ago.  I changed my mind.  Now you chased Mars out of here.  Good.  You don't like Mars?  Did I say that?  I'm asking.  That's how you get people in trouble.  I'm asking the question.  You get people misquoted.  I'm asking the question.  You just said good when I said he left.  Yeah.  So I'm asking, is it safe to assume you don't like Mars? 
[03:42:30]  No, you shouldn't assume anything.  Do you like Mars?  Why wouldn't I?  I don't like hippies.  Hippies or hipsters?  Both.  You look like a hipster.  Sam.  What?  Mars is a martial artist.  Yeah?  Yeah.  And?  I wish he was an engineer.  Oh.  What, you mean like drive a train?  No.  Like, fix things at a radio station.  Yeah, give him something to fix.  I'll fix it.  There's nothing broken here. 
[03:43:00]  No, doesn't Norton's mic cut out?  I think Opie just leans on the button.  All right.  Next topic.  That's not how we work here.  You got to keep it moving along.  You got to keep it interesting.  You're not a good conversationalist.  Oh, and you're so terrific.  Well, I'm trying to bring things up, and you're just stopping them and saying, that's boring.  Let's talk about something else.  All right.  So what else do you want to talk about?  Fashion week?  Yeah, fashion week.  All right.  Speaking of fashion week, did everybody see Opie has a very funny video on YouTube? 
[03:43:30]  If this were up to you, it would just be the club sort of candy plug time hour.  Well, I got nothing going on in my life, so what am I supposed to do?  Find something.  Allow me to dictate the conversation without saying, oh, that's boring.  Why do you got to be such a controller?  What, you know, is it a mommy issue?  Yes, it's a mommy issue.  Yeah.  I wish he was going to make me care cake again.  Look who it is.  Hey, Sal. 
[03:44:00]  How you doing?  How's it going?  Well, Eric didn't teach you how to tear down the studio, did he?  Uh.  Pips, you're going to tell him how to tear down our studio, but you're a Ron and Fez intern.  So, what does that have to do with anything?  How's he going to know the O&A way of doing things?  The O&A way?  What's so different about my way?  Well, I don't know.  I don't do it.  Yeah, so why are you giving me shit?  I'm not giving you shit.  You're giving me shit, Sam.  I just walked in here having a good day giving me shit.  Wow.  Apparently, Club Study Kenny is rubbing off on everybody.  His negativity.  No, I know when I'm dismissed. 
[03:44:30]  When?  When you start talking to interns.  You said I should talk to somebody else.  I did?  You said talk to somebody else.  No, I was saying, like, why don't we talk to Mars?  That was, like, before.  And then I said, bring Eric and talk to Roland.  Sal, you see what I have to deal with?  We said, hello to Sal.  You see this?  And then all of a sudden, you had a...  Daily Baby.  That's Pips.  He's on the after show all the time.  Yeah, he's one of your little pets.  You talk to him on the after show all the time.  He's not a pet.  He's just a guy who works here. 
[03:45:00]  So, I talked to him.  I talked to JTX yesterday because he was walking up and down the hallway.  I know.  No, I heard the after show yesterday.  All right.  All right.  Is Opie going to come back in here, do you think?  He didn't answer my text yet.  He's probably gone.  He was talking with one of the bosses last time I saw him.  Yeah, I bet he left and he just walked home and, Kenny, you missed him.  And that's your job.  I'm terrible at my job.  You are?  Eric, can you please isolate that?  Okay.  Thank you. 
[03:45:30]  Yeah.  I'll say it again.  It's no secret.  I don't think you're terrible, Kenny.  I've brushed your chops a little bit, but you're not terrible at your job.  You're good at your job.  You know that.  You're a good security guard.  You keep us all secure.  And, honestly?  Security guard is demeaning.  Well, what are you then?  Security professional?  I'm a security specialist.  I'm sorry.  You are a security specialist.  You're not just like some mall cop.  Wait.  I just got a text. 
[03:46:00]  Okay.  Where are you?  Exactly.  How did you know?  I'll put on the shit show.  Why is this right after the show?  Nobody calls it that anymore.  Wow, Kenny.  I mean, you are just not an electric person in here.  Today.  I'm not saying always.  Because sometimes you bring the electricity.  But today you're just...  I don't know what's up with you. 
[03:46:30]  Don't you...  Hold on.  Let me take this phone call.  Who is it?  Hi, GH.  I'm on the shit show.  It's like he's talking to his parent.  I came back in to find out, like, where you were with the meeting.  Should I put you on speakerphone?  Should I put you on speakerphone so people can hear you on the microphone?  Or should I just come downstairs and get the truck? 
[03:47:00]  He's already downstairs.  All right.  Hold on.  What happened?  All right.  You're on speakerphone, too.  And I'm trying to, you know, give Sam a little dose of reality.  Because he's a little uppity today.  What are you talking about?  I'm going to ask, what kind of problems is Sam creating today?  I know.  He's trying to set me up to, like, talk bad. 
[03:47:30]  To do what?  About somebody.  I asked you why you were here.  All the time, me and Troy have a problem.  Yeah.  I started that whole hipster thing.  And Troy says that I was the one that called him a hipster.  You did call him a hipster.  I never called Troy a hipster.  You called him a hipster yesterday.  And now me and Troy hate each other.  Yeah.  We absolutely despise each other now because of Sam.  Well, I mean, I'm sorry that happened, but I don't think that's my fault.  I can't hear anybody.  You know, that's what I'll tell you right now. 
[03:48:00]  But I know that me and Troy now have problems because of Sam.  It should start.  I'll straighten it out, G.H., but Sam.  What happened to your head?  What?  What happened?  You all right?  Me?  Okay.  No, I'm talking to some nice old lady that has a broken hand.  I want to know why she broke her hand.  That's what I do.  Is she okay?  She's a caring person.  I care about people when I'm not doing the radio show.  Thank God.  Should I come downstairs?  Yes.  Well, Anthony blew up the meeting. 
[03:48:30]  I mean, Anthony had a prior commitment, so we don't have our meeting today.  I'm standing out here just fucking playing with myself.  No, don't do that outside on the street.  I'll be right there.  Sam, I can't hear you because I'm only on a speakerphone through Kenny's phone.  I can't hear anything Sam's saying, so obviously he's talking more shit.  I know.  I know.  That's how dumb he is.  I'll be right there.  Thank God.  Why?  Hey, you might be doing some good radio right now.  I am doing good radio despite Sam being the host. 
[03:49:00]  Thank you for getting that note today, by the way.  It was a real help for me and my family.  Well, you know, I aim to please.  You should just have a private conversation right now.  You already are.  You don't have to worry about Sam.  I don't have to worry about Sam.  I didn't realize Open usually worries about me.  I don't think he's a hipster.  And that's it.  Here comes Jimmy.  All right.  Here comes Chip. 
[03:49:30]  You can use the answer microphone if you want for the speakerphone or either one.  It doesn't matter.  I'm coming right now.  How come you don't end up down there already?  No, because I was finding out what was going on with the meeting.  What's a meeting?  I told you there was no meeting.  All right.  I'll be right there.  What are you doing?  I just thought John Ingram was driving a cab.  I thought his acting was doing well.  Oh, jeez.  What's that?  Chip.  What's that?  Welcome to the show. 
[03:50:00]  Bye-bye.  Thanks.  You want me to turn the radio psychic?  There you go.  Yeah.  You like that?  You don't even have your headphones on.  You don't know what you're doing.  I don't even have your headphones on.  I don't even have your headphones on.  I don't even have your headphones on.  I don't even have your headphones on.  Well, obviously they've hooked up.  I like Dick.  Hey, how come I don't recognize any of these sounds or something?  Who is this?  Fezzy and Ronald?  Yeah.  That's Ron's.  It's Ron's 360, Chip.  Why is Ron playing all these noises?  You are playing the noises.  Oh.  I wanted to tell you, it looks like part three of Chipper TV is ready to go. 
[03:50:30]  I mean, we're ready to launch today.  It should be up.  It should have been up two years ago or something.  It wasn't done two years ago.  How come you got sunglasses on when you're going to the moon or something for a vacation?  Over there with your eyeglasses and stuff.  Don't encourage him, Roland.  Chip, you're on a roll today at the end of the O&A show.  I'm always on a roll.  That's why I got to stand on it and I get stuff from the roll on my feet and eat butter or something.  Southern butter joke?  Yeah, I did that one already.  Yeah.  Sometimes they're worth repeating.  What do you think of Mars over there? 
[03:51:00]  He's like a planet or something.  Mars.  Have you met Pips, the Ron and Fez intern?  Who?  Pips, he's that guy right there.  That's good.  How come there's not only one of them?  I mean, they're all plurals.  How come you're not Roland's or Sam's?  Just Sam, Roland, and Pips.  Do you want to meet the new intern?  No.  Okay.  What?  No, I mean, I don't know if you wanted to see him or...  What am I going to do?  Wanted to talk to him or riff? 
[03:51:30]  I don't know.  I know you like to riff.  I could riff a little bit.  Where is he?  He's coming.  Yeah, Sal's going to come in.  Okay.  What's that, a song?  Yes, it's a song.  It's from...  That's a long one.  Yeah, well, I'm going to turn it down.  I'm going to turn it off.  I'm going to...  You can press stop on it.  I don't know how to do that.  Stop.  There you go.  This is Sal, the intern.  Sal?  Yeah.  What are you, an arree or something?  Salary.  Yeah.  Hey, Sal, what are you, an ad or something?  Salad.  Yeah. 
[03:52:00]  Yeah.  Like that.  That's where you're going, though.  Sal, what are you, a mon or something?  Salmon.  Yeah, what are you, Sal?  What are you, an e or something?  Sal?  Sal, what are you, a Sal, what are you, a salty guy or something?  Salty.  All right, that's all.  What about, you ever going to call him a manila or anything?  What's that?  Salmonila.  What, is he an envelope or something?  No.  Manila.  That'd be so stupid.  Manila envelopes.  Yeah, it would be stupid.  I used to think they was vanilla. 
[03:52:30]  Vanilla.  Yeah.  And my mother would go, no, no, Chippa, it's manila.  And then a friend, a friend would help her lick the envelopes.  That's what he was doing down there.  She would have a lot of envelopes on the floor, and he would sit between her legs and lean  down and lick all the envelopes.  I don't think that's what he was doing, Chipp.  That's what she said he was doing.  I think she was lying to you, buddy.  She said he was licking the envelopes with his big lips.  So how's the comedy?  He had his pink tongue, too.  Yeah, did he?  Yeah.  You saw his tongue?  You saw his tongue? 
[03:53:00]  Yeah.  How did you see it?  Hey, what are you doing, planting a flag or something?  Planting a flag?  He's putting up a movie projector screen.  No, he's not.  How's the comedy going?  It's good.  Yeah?  You getting gigs?  Yeah, not yet.  No?  Yeah, it's good.  Still working on stuff?  Yeah.  Putting stuff together?  Hey, what are you doing over there?  Taking a trip to the sun or something?  Yeah, that's the rolling in his sunglasses.  Yeah.  What are you, got no eyes or something?  You already made reference to that.  He's got allergies, so he's wearing a...  What are you allergic to?  Sunlight or something or water?  No, he just took a drink of water. 
[03:53:30]  And so you just saw water and thought you'd riff about that.  Yeah.  Are you thirsty?  Yeah, that's probably more accurately why he took the drink of water.  Are you getting any...  But you're not getting any...  No.  What about like open mic stuff?  You doing any of them?  No.  He's making me uncomfortable, this guy.  I don't know who he is.  You want him to take off?  Yes, I do.  Okay, see you later, Sal.  See you later, Sal.  Yeah.  What are you, Manila or something?  Like an envelope?  Sal Manila?  We did that one. 
[03:54:00]  No, we didn't.  Okay.  If you say so.  So how do you...  If you're not doing gigs or you're not doing open mics either?  No, I don't do that.  I want money.  I told the guy I don't do nothing for less than $2,000.  Have you ever done a gig though?  Yeah, a few times.  I just go up there and riff.  And that's what you tell him?  Boom, let's go right up there.  He goes, you know, do you have any experience?  And you go a few times.  He knows.  What, do you want to take calls?  Yeah, but I got to put the headphones on or something.  Yeah, you can put those on or any ones you want.  You want to go over there?  What do you got, your eyes are something or a little red? 
[03:54:30]  No, you already asked him about his sunglasses.  That's rolling.  Go ahead and...  Yeah, just put him on hold.  It doesn't matter what he has to say.  Chip will just talk to him.  Just put him right on hold.  There you go.  866-WOW1-WOW.  Talk to Chip on the after show.  Anthony in New Orleans.  Yeah, I want to know how you guys have been missing the obvious when you keep talking about  LMFAO's Party Rock.  How is that not E-Rock's new theme song?  Hey, what are you doing down in New Orleans?  What, do you think you're a saint or something? 
[03:55:00]  Are you marching in?  Of course.  Go Saints.  What are you doing down there?  What, are you running around eating gumbo or something?  Yeah, yeah, yeah, Chip.  Punching out.  Yeah?  Who are you punching out?  Are you socking somebody?  This is good.  Get some more people.  All right.  Call.  I don't know if the phone lines blew up just now.  866-WOW1-WOW.  You still on there, Anthony?  Yeah, I'm still here.  Oh, Anthony's still there if you want to...  I'm done.  I just, boom.  I just kill and I move on.  Okay, we'll just go to... 
[03:55:30]  You're done.  Next, you're on the air.  Hi, Next.  Is that your name?  Well, that must be convenient when you're in line.  Everybody's yelling next and you're like, all right, and you keep running around there  or something.  717.  Yeah, I got a moral question for Chipper.  If he could kill somebody and get away with it, who would it be?  If I kill somebody, I'd probably kill him with kindness or something.  I don't know.  No, you're not going to name a person or anything, though?  What's that?  You said who, not how.  It's kind of like an interesting question, and you just said kill him with kindness for 
[03:56:00]  no reason.  Who would I kill if I could?  I don't know.  I'll probably kill...  Maybe anybody in the studio?  Nobody in the studio, but I'd probably kill the one guy who, when my mother would have  him come over, would always...  He would always come into my room while my mother was making his drinks.  The heavy breathing guy?  No, but he was the big guy. 
[03:56:30]  He looked like the guy...  Who was the guy with the Stephen...  The Green Mile?  He looked like him.  Yeah, I know.  He was also Clark Duncan.  Yeah, he would always come in and he always had our overalls with a giant big bulge and he  would put me on his lap and he would whisper to my...  He kissed my neck a lot while my mother was making his drinks.  He liked Colt 45s with 7-Up.  Chip, this may be a tough question.  I don't even know if you want to tackle it right now.  Hey, what do you get your sunglasses on for?  What are you writing?  A movie or something about shiny things?  What?  I don't know if you want to tackle this right now, but we...  Tackle when we play football or something? 
[03:57:00]  Were you molested as a child?  What?  Never mind.  We'll just go to line one.  I was Chip.  4-8.  4-8-4.  Hey, what's this guy?  Well, was 4 hungry?  How come 4-8-4 was 4 really hungry, so he ate 4?  What are you, a comedian or something?  My mother was a saint.  My mother was a saint on Earth.  Is he making...  Oh, he hung up.  I think he was making fun of you.  No, he's not.  You're on the air.  9-7-3.  Chip, I love you.  What's a weird name? 
[03:57:30]  9-7-3.  No, well, I don't know his name.  9 plus 7 is...  9 plus 3 is 12 or something.  I don't know.  What's your name, sir?  I've had the biggest crush on Chip.  What's your name?  John.  It's John.  What are you, a bathroom or something?  An outhouse going to the bathroom on you?  I'm in the bathroom.  What's everybody doing?  Shitting in your mouth and face?  Where are you from, John?  Jersey.  Jersey?  Where in Jersey?  Elmett Park.  Oh, yeah.  That place is stupid.  Everything that aids in the water and stuff.  But I want to move in with you, Chip.  Yeah? 
[03:58:00]  Yeah.  Why don't you move into a garbage dump or something?  And then you could be John.  Everybody could just shit in your face and eyes.  Thank you, John.  I cook you dinner every night, Chip.  Please let me be with you.  Hey, Roland, what are you doing with that?  Looking into a strobe light or something?  Chip, you ever think about giving up comedy and just doing a radio show?  I do both.  I do them all.  Do you find this difficult?  It's easy.  You think so?  Yeah, just talk.  Boom.  I could do this all day.  Just go to another call then?  Yeah.  All right.  Uh, 978, you're on the after show. 
[03:58:30]  978?  How are you?  What did 97 have for dinner?  Because 978, I wonder what 97 would eat.  All right.  What's your name, sir?  Bill.  Bill.  Where are you from?  Oh, hey, Bill.  How you doing?  How come I always get you in a restaurant?  Why are you always sitting on the front of a duck or something?  Go ahead, Bill.  That's too Bill.  Chip, your mother's a whore.  What's that?  Your mother's a whore.  It's not true.  My mother's a saint on earth.  Why don't you watch your fresh talk?  We don't need language.  Don't use fresh talk like that.  My mother would always say that.  Whenever I would say dirty words, like, sometime I would say, hey, Ma, your friend was grabbing 
[03:59:00]  my cock and squeezing it.  And she would always go, don't use that type of potty talk, Chip, and she'd slap my face.  I think it's interesting that when someone insults your mother, you don't want to use foul  language, but when they're insulting anything else, you have quite a potty mouth.  I don't have a potty mouth, but that's what the man would say.  I would tell my mother, like, Mom, your friend who looks like the guy from Green Mile was  putting both of his fingers in my asshole and treating me like a sock puppet.  And she'd go, Chip, I don't use those words. 
[03:59:30]  Is that a true story that he did that?  Yes, he did.  207.  You're on the show.  207?  Oh, no, I'm late.  I got to catch a plane or something.  Those are like sunglasses.  What are you doing?  Living in the desert or something?  Arizona, Roland or something?  He's got allergies.  What's he allergic to?  The sun?  He already asked me that.  Hey, Chipper, how do you feel when the niggas move in your neighborhood?  I don't know.  I don't care about black people.  As long as they're not helping my mother fix the floor anymore. 
[04:00:00]  You don't like that.  She used to have a lot of black friends that would come over and help her fix the floor  and lick her stamps.  How often would the floor get messed up?  A lot.  It was always getting wrecked up.  And she'd go, Chipper.  Oh, Chipper.  Leroy spilled something on the floor.  He's got to come over and fix it real hard.  Did you guys stay in all together, all three of you in the room?  No, I'd be in the bushes.  Making sure nobody came over there or something.  Standing guard?  Yeah.  850.  My mother always knew when I was in the bushes because I would come out and sometimes I'd 
[04:00:30]  have a bump in the front of my pants and there'd be bush berries on it.  You'd get an erection from your mother and whoever was helping her.  That's disgusting, Chipp.  850.  Hey, Chipp, did you grow up with a friend named Dale?  What's that?  Dale, why would I be?  No, I don't know anybody named Dale.  I think that was a joke.  Chipp and Dale.  Who were they?  Disney characters?  That's stupid.  You didn't like that one.  No.  Okay, I know generally you don't like when other people make jokes. 
[04:01:00]  Yes, I do.  You do?  That was a stupid one.  You just like good jokes?  Yeah, the quality.  Okay.  Like, hey, what are you wearing sunglasses inside for?  What do you think, that we're on the roof or something?  No.  Why would you think we're on the roof?  617.  Chipp, you're killing right now.  I know I am.  I always do, but Sam was right.  Six plus one is seven.  What are you, showing off for a math movie or something?  No, there's no movies.  Hey, Chipp, where do you meet all your girls?  That's some me to know and you not to find out.  Good one, Chipp. 
[04:01:30]  Nailed him.  Everybody should have a question for Chipp at this point.  631, what's your name, where are you from, and what's your question for Chipp?  My name is Mike.  I live in Buffalo.  Chipp, I want to know...  You live in a Buffalo?  Oh, no, you're probably going to step on its ribs and heart and rib cage.  How do you live in a Buffalo?  What, do you crawl out of his butt to go to work and you smell like Buffalo shit?  And your boss goes, hey, you smell like Buffalo shit?  It's disgusting.  I'm not really from here, but it does smell like shit up here.  Oh, what do you do?  Do you just kind of fall out of the Buffalo's open asshole and hit the floor? 
[04:02:00]  Disgusting.  You have to run to work?  I want to know, Chipp, if you watch basketball, and if you do, if Bosch is your favorite player.  I don't watch basketball.  I used to dribble a lot, but then I'd get it all over the table or something.  That's a very good joke.  I like that.  A little sports humor.  I don't like Chris Bosch.  No?  He's a model, isn't he?  I don't know.  He's really handsome.  You think so?  Yeah.  He's good looking.  All right.  He treats fans good.  I like him a lot.  Yeah?  Yeah.  You watch it.  Hey, I bet your Roland's favorite team is the Phoenix Suns.  Why is that?  Because he looks like he's looking at the sun.  He's got sunglasses on. 
[04:02:30]  Phoenix Suns.  He's got allergies, so he's wearing sunglasses.  Where'd Mars go to break something?  That's just true.  484, what's your name?  Where are you from?  Oh, I guess four is hungry.  Stop with the eight jokes.  Chip, that's fine.  I just wanted to see if you could wrap on me.  Hey, what are you doing?  Eating helium balloons or something?  You're talking like you're up there in the Axle Fear.  Axle Fear.  Axle Fear.  What were you saying, sir?  You hung up already.  Oh, good.  Another 484.  You like that, Chip?  Yeah, my mother said I was autistic because I would just do this for hours. 
[04:03:00]  Sometimes when she'd be with her friends in her room, I would just be doing this in the closet until everybody went home.  You think you might be autistic?  My mother thought I had autism.  Self-diagnosed.  She would slap me in the face and say, talk, and I would start talking.  484.  Yeah, this is Lorenzo.  I used to come over all the time.  I played basketball at Cooley High, and we weren't fixing no headboard.  We were fucking the shit out of Ms. Chipson. 
[04:03:30]  All in her ass and titties and shit.  That's very disrespectful.  That's very disrespectful.  Cooley High was a movie with Lawrence Hilton Jacobs.  That's right, Chip.  Yeah, my mother was never watching no movies.  You caught him in a lie.  Yes, I did.  That's a bunch of lies.  What are you listening to?  The Phoenix Suns or something, Roland?  What do you mean?  I'm listening to the Phoenix Suns.  That's a basketball team.  That's right.  We're going to New York, Chip.  2-1-2.  That's where I am.  It's actually David from Israel again, and I want to know what Chip thought about our 
[04:04:00]  wonderful president.  What's that?  The president?  I don't know who the president is over there.  I've never been to Israel.  They asked me to come over there.  They're like, do you want to come to Israel?  I'm like, all right.  But I tried to get him down on the price.  What's that called again?  I can't remember.  How do you get somebody down on a price?  I don't remember.  But I was going to go to Israel over there.  But I'm like, what's the wall?  A big whale or something?  I don't know what's happening.  Yeah.  Chip, you're all.  Yeah. 
[04:04:30]  Because I would smoke Salem cigarettes.  So I figured that was like Jerusalem or something.  I just got word jokes.  It's horrible.  And you don't remember what that word is?  Chip, you're getting distracted again.  I'm going to go over there and slap you in the face.  That's what I'm going to do.  I can't help it.  I just like the sound of the bell.  And you don't remember the word for bringing the price down on something.  You just hit the bell again.  229.  I don't even know where that is.  You're on the show.  Oh, 229.  Where's that?  Georgia. 
[04:05:00]  That's right.  Ramon, who gave this half-breed bag of the show?  Are they talking to you or me?  What's that?  They hung up.  I think he's talking to rolling sunglasses.  He's going, what are you guys doing?  You're supposed to be in the shade or something.  The caller ID.  Look at E-Rock's back there laughing.  What do you think of E-Rock?  What's that?  What do you think of E-Rock?  He's a nice guy.  You like him?  Yeah.  You guys ever...  I always like people from Florida, though.  He's a good guy.  Why do you like people from Florida?  I don't know.  We had a Coke float once.  You and E-Rock together?  Yeah, it was nice. 
[04:05:30]  Did you go over to his house?  Yeah, he made me a meat martini.  To go with the Coke float?  Yeah, right in his zipper.  He was drunk.  He was trying to stick his cock right in my mouth.  Did it work?  Falling for a few minutes.  You're on the air.  Talk.  Yeah.  Hey, Chip, when's the next album coming out?  You have an album?  No, we're burning embers.  We were working on something.  But the bass player got arrested.  What did he get arrested for?  He was throwing Molotov cocktails at people of color. 
[04:06:00]  I'm glad that he's in jail, then, because I don't think that's acceptable behavior in our society.  He thought that he would always say, like, white is right.  And anybody who wasn't white, he would throw Molotov cocktails at.  But he's a good bassist.  He's not a good bassist.  Yeah, he was.  He's not a good person.  He would always say things to me about my mother.  Chip, I hate to tell you this, but the show's over.  It's not Chip.  Chip, the show's over.  It's time to go.  Chip!  It's just not ringing the bell. 
[04:06:30]  I get very distracted.  I know.  The show's over.  Is there anything you want to say goodbye?  No, I don't, but I care for goodbyes.  All right, well, make sure you go to...  Maybe Roland can take his sunglasses off of something and start getting, like, whoa, I'm seeing myself.  What are you, in a mirror store?  No, he's not in a mirror store.  Chip TV show on YouTube in part three is going to be up later today, the final part.  Thanks for stopping by, Chip.  You really, you did something special with us today.  Stay tuned.  Ron or Fezzer next.
