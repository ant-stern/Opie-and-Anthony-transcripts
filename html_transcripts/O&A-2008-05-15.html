<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show opened with a dramatically over-the-top intro, which the hosts jokingly mocked.  The absence of co-host Jimmy was a running gag throughout the broadcast, with humorous speculation about his whereabouts.  The 2008 presidential election dominated much of the discussion, focusing on John Edwards' endorsement of Barack Obama and featuring cynical commentary on the voting process, voter apathy, and superdelegates, laced with offensive language targeting various demographics.  A caller suggested ATM voting, sparking further debate about voter turnout and the candidates. A trucker also called in, contributing to the discussion of the electoral system.

A significant portion focused on the impending births of nieces or nephews to Opie and Anthony, featuring humorous anecdotes about their experiences with their own relatives, along with comments about a pregnant family member's appearance.  This segment included a Stephen Lynch song about an ugly baby.  Celebrity gossip also featured prominently, particularly Angelina Jolie and Brad Pitt's family and Pitt's unusual tattoo.  The story of an NYU graduate arrested for running across the field during his Yankee Stadium graduation ceremony was recounted in detail, with humorous and vulgar commentary.  The show also covered Sean Penn's political commentary and Barack Obama's apology for calling a reporter "sweetie."  The hosts expressed a desire for a return to a less politically correct era.  The show was rife with profanity and sexually suggestive humor.

A subsequent segment began with a discussion of hypothetical large-scale disasters.  Peggy Agar from Channel 7 was mentioned, leading to a comedic bit involving a recording of a politician dismissing Agar's question by calling her "sweetie," followed by a mock apology call from a Barack Obama impersonator, referencing "Baby Got Back."  The hosts expressed their disdain for CBS FM staff, who occupied their green room, using offensive language.  A discussion on personal grooming for older men followed.

Mick Foley, a professional wrestler, appeared as a guest, promoting *SmackDown*.  His attire prompted humorous commentary.  A significant portion focused on Jill Nicolini, a Channel 11 traffic reporter, with the hosts revealing her single status and Anthony's apparent interest.  A flirtatious phone call with Nicolini was arranged, leading to plans for a date.  William Shatner also called in, promoting his autobiography, "Up Till Now," engaging in humorous banter with the hosts.  The segment concluded with continued discussion of Foley’s appearances and Nicolini's burgeoning relationship with Anthony.

A further segment prominently featured Mick Foley detailing his wrestling injuries, including a gruesome ear incident.  He also joked about his teeth.  The hosts continued discussing Anthony's potential relationship with Jill Nicolini, with numerous sexually suggestive jokes from the hosts and callers.  The conversation then shifted to a sexual harassment lawsuit against Bob Stokes, a former weatherman, with lurid details recounted.  Numerous calls followed, with puns relating to both Nicolini and Stokes.  Finally, Russell Simmons briefly appeared, promoting his book, “Do You,” and discussing self-help, success, and his views on the Iraq War.

Russell Simmons' appearance continued into the next segment, where he discussed hip hop's philanthropic side, contrasting it with that of politicians. He mentioned Remy Ma's prison sentence.  He emphasized the importance of mindset in achieving success, defining success as happiness, and discussed the challenges of escaping poverty.  He reflected on his career with Run-DMC and his role on *Run's House*.  He discussed criticism of rap lyrics and the debate surrounding Imus' firing. He argued for artistic merit over censorship and expressed support for Obama.  He also briefly touched upon hip-hop movies and the success of his book, mentioning Oprah Winfrey’s role.  A listener, Charlie, called in with celebrity photos and autographs, sparking a rambling exchange.  Paul McCartney's environmental hypocrisy was also briefly mentioned.

The final segment heavily featured Charlie and his scrapbook of celebrity photos.  Opie, Anthony, and Jimmy Norton made numerous crude and offensive jokes about the celebrities pictured. Charlie's discomfort was a recurring theme.  A sponsored segment failed due to technical difficulties, leading to more comedic exchanges. The segment included questions about Charlie's personal life and a brief, awkward interview attempt by a crew member, Roland, concluding with more crude jokes and banter.

[00:01:30]  the show on the road  i gotta tell you after uh hearing that long involved over the top intro and the dramatic music before it  yes and the teaser before that there's a lot of pressure on us to entertain oh geez i never  thought of that oh my god we talk into these things and people listen i think it would be better if uh  the show started with something that just went oh um here they are oh and a opie and anthony then the 
[00:02:00]  expectations are lowered a little bit yeah that kind of sets the bar pretty high the dramatic music  ecstasy of gold and then and then a highlight reel of how great we are highlight reel oh my god i got  to tell you that ecstasy of gold could be the most pompous opening for anything absolutely we stole  that from metallica of course metallica does the big ecstasy of gold but uh the beauty of when they do it

[00:03:30]  on two oh and a i went to bed really early last night so i kind of missed the world spinning uh for  a while yeah anything happened last night that i need to know about nah john edwards what endorsed  obama big deal who cares whatever well a lot of people speculating now that might be the ticket  oh really yeah because it's really kind of the first um one of these high profile democratic  candidates to come out and um you know the former candidates uh to come out and endorse one of these 
[00:04:00]  guys yeah either obama or hillary and um i don't know it's it's a young you know white guy so maybe  that's what the ticket needs well you you would think that's what obama needs right yeah but people  still speculate maybe hillary will be brought on board and you think that's a death sentence uh  yeah a lot of people do they think that's a bit much but you got a lot of women a lot of women would  vote for hillary right would they you would lose the you would lose the uh the white man vote the 
[00:04:30]  white man vote i guess that's a biggie that might be the biggest one yeah i don't know that's if whitey  decides to go out and vote in numbers whitey is a very uh i don't know we just kind of hang out  a lot of apathy in whitey because we know it's all bs yeah but then uh they get the vote out for  the minorities and uh the women and uh they try to get a lot of young voters out who are predominantly  democratic and want to see change man you don't vote do you uh yeah i do you actually vote i don't 
[00:05:00]  i do i have no problem saying it i don't yeah it's too much of a hassle is it just a pain in the ass  too much trying to find a church or a school and church or a school it's just gonna be easy i think  they they kind of put that information out there uh i don't think you have to go very far to vote to  tell you the truth it's not very far from i don't know where i'm supposed to vote i don't know where  if you don't vote shut up then you have no right to complain that's that's but that's why i don't vote 
[00:05:30]  that's my protest but it's not even that isn't even true i don't like i don't set the prices of  things i buy but i can complain about how much they cost i don't have any say in it hey man if i'm  if i uh if i have passion for for something or i'm into a candidate oh i'll vote i voted for uh  chris daughtry oh you mean like american idol oh yeah i actually went out of my way and i i dialed the 
[00:06:00]  phone so you want to be able to vote for a president like that we just dial him up i yell  american idol style just see him standing there during a debate and have uh ryan seacrest there  going all right and have him behind him going four four yeah i'm number four four it's easier to vote  for the american idol contestants yeah than the president of the united states of america yeah  uh they don't want people to come out in massive numbers to vote for the president's uh the 
[00:06:30]  president of the united states of america they just don't want you to that's why that's why they  make it hard and that's why they have the election on a tuesday yeah they make it a little complicated  if they really wanted you to vote for the president wouldn't they have it on a saturday  yeah when everybody's off or when they uh insist that everyone takes off on tuesday election day  they don't they don't they throw it on a tuesday tuesday is probably the worst day of the week  some people say monday but you know what you're you're still in a haze from the weekend of  drinking and partying and and you got all those memories of banging broads and stuff monday flies 
[00:07:00]  by it really does yeah you're not happy to be there but it just goes by like that and then  tuesday comes along just so far from everything which is fun yeah which is still a day away from hump day  tuesday is the worst day of the week and that's why the election is on a tuesday they don't want you  voting yeah so it really does show that the uh whole voting system they really don't want  america choosing the president i don't think they ever did and then like these these little 
[00:07:30]  catch words come out every election and this year it's super delegate did anyone ever hear of super  delegate before this election no is this a new thing i really don't know what it is still it's kind  of an important delegate guy somebody in politics that uh you know right that's pretty much what like  i heard ray nagin is a super delegate ray nagin yeah yeah now that nut from new orleans is a 
[00:08:00]  super delegate that's what i heard and he backed obama and they count for about 10 to 100 times the  normal delegate because they're super yeah of course and who started this it's a nut i don't know  the democrats did the democrats started it and that figures they needed a new little plan something to  yeah something to uh get him in there you know oh god pretty much every single person in america  has a cell phone i'm sure they could come up with some kind of technology where they would get  one vote per cell phone for the presidency of the the united states of america but they don't want us 
[00:08:30]  to vote i think this a lot of people are afraid possible of electronics they're afraid uh that it's  too easily manipulated american idol's not afraid and a lot of times people uh accuse them of uh some  shady dealings in their voting but that's way more important than the election i know  people saying you should be able to vote through an atm by an atm well we all know how to use atm 
[00:09:00]  it's just the trucker this guy might be on to something josh what are you hauling this morning  uh shit i don't know jp penny that's good thank you john thanks for the first one of the day yeah  what do you got hey uh i was gonna say why don't we just vote using the atm machine you know it's all  digital the computer can tally it up and you know if they really wanted people to vote they could like  maybe put five bucks in your account for doing it hey there you go i mean pay for your votes is it 
[00:09:30]  what the whole country is supposed to be based on hey one vote one check well if you want to get  people out there that would that would be another way to do it i don't know i think that's a certain  so i element of society that i don't think i want voting a lot i don't vote the poor i uh right  i've yelled obama a bunch of times but uh when it comes down by at the screen  by some other words when it comes down to it i don't like any of these candidates so why would i vote 
[00:10:00]  um i'm supposed to vote for the lesser of two yeah i understand all that that's what you're  supposed to do i guess or or then ruin the whole thing by voting for that independent guy right that  just chimed in yeah what's his name oh bob bar he's been around forever that guy bob bar he's been  one of these washington guys forever saying he could take away mccain votes how that's the thing  well they're saying that uh by being a libertarian he's a lot closer to mccain's ideology than he is  obama's or hillary's so uh like the ralph nader thing usually takes away from when he goes with 
[00:10:30]  that green party yeah uh usually takes away from democrats this one's going to be taken away from  the republican yeah whatever whatever uh arty in brooklyn what's up hey boys uh super delegate is  someone with past political presence like bill clinton or george bush or gary canuccio somebody like  that right all right so that's that's what a super delegate yeah i just said that though so 
[00:11:00]  yeah you're just reiterating what i said it's early though we're all just waking up here but so  uh if you win uh the most delegates but you lose the super delegates then what happens  exactly opie you don't know either right it's it's like what isn't or do you have to just win  the super delegates in the end see i think oh wait a minute we're gonna get we're gonna get some info  if you don't if nobody has enough delegates at the convention they go into the brokered state and the 
[00:11:30]  super delegates can put you over because they count for so many right this is going to be a fight on the  floor in august it's going to be a mess i hope literally a fight i give it to hillary yeah obama  doesn't look like a fighter uh he's got a good left jab you could tell you think yeah hillary he's got a  good left jab i just picture hillary going in windmilling like she did at bill clinton when she  uh found out he was having sex just windmilling and crying have you ever had to deal with a wind 
[00:12:00]  been on the brunt of that oh hell yes you've had to deal with a windmilling dude what are you kidding  really there's something that your wife gets angry at when you bring your girlfriend home  and you will get a windmilling i guarantee it but how do you defend against a windmilling you just  got to kind of put your hands up yeah and uh kind of try to it's almost like you're a boxing uh  yeah like uh one of those old time like mickey sure and you're holding your hands up going come on hit  it harder hit it out you're just trying to deflect the blows but you definitely don't want to 
[00:12:30]  you know block and then give her a nice right cross right right you can't do that so you just got  to block the windmill but the windmill is just such a you're like please could you get tired  already very hard to defend against oh traditional boxing yeah you know you could still get your ass  kicked but at least you know where the punches are coming from for the most part is he going for a  body blow is it all right he's jabbing me a little bit and if they start windmilling it's easy to crack  somebody when they're windmilling but when it's a girl you can't crack them so you just got to defend 
[00:13:00]  against the windmill you got to take her legs out it's very hard she comes at you with a windmilling  you got to take her legs out you can't be taking her legs out because then if she's on her back  then she can't do the windmilling anymore because she can't get the arms all the way around all  she's got a windmill once you take her legs out is to the phone and call the police and you are going  away did we ever tell the brother joe story that's why uh yeah i think so yeah i think we told that  once are we allowed to tell it again his ex i don't want to blow up anyone's spot dad leave it as 
[00:13:30]  as yeah we'll check with joe joe as a matter of fact is uh uh i guess uh bedside with his uh girl  waiting for a baby that happened yesterday yeah it's taken forever she should have had the kid by  now no it was like you know the the water breaking thing yeah and then after that who knows how long  are you uh prepared to be an uncle what do i got to prepare i don't know do i have to prepare do you  have to really prepare to be an uncle it's actually a really easy job it's a fun job i i like 
[00:14:00]  being an uncle yeah i really do do you yeah what do you do because you you mess up the kid and then  you go home you tell you you teach him stuff that the parents certainly don't want to teach them so  you're the cool guy you have no problem cursing in front of them and then the the parent looks at  you like oh thanks thanks now they're gonna be staying in the airport at school and i'm gonna get  the phone calls and then you just leave and wash your hands of the whole thing yeah you buy them candy  and stuff that i'm not supposed to before their dinner dude they'll they end up loving you more 
[00:14:30]  than their own parents but what because you don't discipline them you're the cool guy you don't make  them eat right you're like hey you want to go get some candy and you did jump in your car and you go  get some some candy uh back in the day my my first uh my first nephew who's now oh my god he's like  he's like pre-med and at gainesville he's just he's a rock star i mean the guy is he's ridiculously  smart i remember the day like hey jason let's go uh get some candy and then because you know i've

[00:32:30]  i'm glad they didn't i'm glad they tackled the crap out of this kid the story goes uh they like  to do some some of these graduation ceremonies at yankee stadium yeah why did they do that and i think  it was nyu's uh graduation they're all at yankee stadium and this uh dopey kid runs out onto the field  and he wants to round the bases he's graduating from nyu yeah he rounds third and then they just 
[00:33:00]  destroy him in front of all his classmates pounced on him you know why i enjoy this why it instantly  shows him this couldn't have happened faster by the way because he just graduates just gets his diploma  and they pounce on him it shows him the party's over ass the party's over it's no more getting out  there running around yeah party dude look at me no not look at me get to work earn a living and be in  hell for the rest of your life what a great angle i was just like that's it reality hit him the second 
[00:33:30]  he grabbed his diploma he got pounced on that's life enjoy it idiot the party's over you didn't  you didn't get to touch home plate did you i gotta tell you i uh i decided to do five years of college  because i was having so much fun and uh i didn't want to grow up yeah there were many many times  during my life i decided i didn't want to grow up you know the first time when when things started  growing i decided to get rid of that immediately because i still wanted to ride my 10 10 speed bike it's 
[00:34:00]  horrible and then uh the college thing the keg parties aren't as much fun when when you're not  in college anymore oh it's kind of silly you're like well the keg party's cool and i'm getting  wasted but i gotta find a job yeah gotta pay for all this crap now exactly can't rely on my buddies  and stuff and i'm just crashing in dorm rooms and stuff yeah this kid apparently had like no pants  on um he's wearing his super cool shades it was hot yesterday come on was it and he got the gown on 
[00:34:30]  i mean he had his underpants yeah you know what it's it's just to be wild and look at me it's  first of all it ain't about you it's about everybody else graduating and he's got to jump out and he thinks  the party's still going the second that diploma hits your hand the party's over done and he thought  he'd have one last little blast and barack obama tackled him as he was uh rounding third yeah but 
[00:35:00]  he's a star today we're all talking about him oh yeah and and the uh the daily news gave him a whole  page this should have been a paragraph a whole page with one two three four five pick uh pictures and  and he got the front page another thing i like is uh he i gotta give him this he's a hustler uh he  does uh hustle because he's got three guys on top of him pinning him down and he's still got his arm  reached out and he's trying to get home he's trying to touch home even though he's probably 30 feet from 
[00:35:30]  home plate yeah and he's stretching out you know so you gotta give the kid uh some credit he's he's  showing some hustle oh boy newly minted nyu grad william lopez turned a day of uh pomp and circumstance  at yankee stadium into a day of cop and gown oh i get it wait no i don't oh yes i do oh yeah uh  when he took off his pants that's awful so he took off his pants yeah he took his pants off that's 
[00:36:00]  hilarious because that's wild to do i'm in college man no you're out now he took off his pants dashed  onto the field and tried to steal home ignoring warnings to stay off the field lopez gave in to  a spur of the moment impulse and wearing just boxers beige socks and brown lace-ups under his uh  purple gown he hopped the fence behind first base and raced across the diamond oh excuse me lopez  tagged third hung on to his cap and chugged down the baseline toward home cheered on by many classmates 
[00:36:30]  a security guard tackled him before he reached the plate and i was on the ground and they were  holding me i was literally trying to crawl toward the plate lopez told the daily news what i think  is really funny about this uh i got arrested for trespassing at my own graduation that's funny yeah  you get a record there you now you have a criminal record yeah your first day out he said it'll be a  great story for his grandkids he said it won't he said he wasn't drunk or anything he was just uh 
[00:37:00]  kind of high on happiness and and spontaneity uh he's a huge baseball fan who roots for the  mets lopez said he was just excited to be sitting in the third row on the first base side of the  storied stadium when i got to the stadium i realized how close we were to the field he said that's when  the seed was planted yeah i could see him sitting there with his dopey friends dude i'm gonna do it  no you're not no you know i'm gonna do it i'm gonna do it oh by the way i my math was wrong  kristin and main thank you and angelina jolie will have six kids not five six so brad pitt's 
[00:37:30]  gonna be the father of six kids um that's where the seed was planted am i still reading this story  this should have been like two paragraphs uh me and my friend uh looked at each other and said  would it be funny if someone were to streak across the field about 15 minutes from the end of the  ceremony there was this musical number a medley of new york songs and i said if there was a moment to  do it this would be it what an ass then they played new york new york and i said this is it 
[00:38:00]  am i still reading this why i handed my keys to my friend and i gave my pants to my friend but he  kept on his boxers uh lopez said i didn't want to go all the way down because i thought they might  nail me for public indecency then when the security guard was looking the other way i just made a break  for it nail him for public indecency what did he think that wasn't going to be a crime anyway  yeah the second you hop over that uh little wall they're taking you down and arresting you for  trespassing uh only halfway through i don't know where we're going to stop with this i hopped down 
[00:38:30]  the stairs and over the divider and i'm out in the middle of the field and i'm thinking am i really  doing this oh my god what was it a slow news day uh lopez said and then i i start hearing the crowd  booed by the cheers lopez lopez said he raced for third and people were going crazy were they i made  a cut to the third base side so i could run home so it would end up with a bang he said right when i  got 15 feet from the plate there was a security guard waiting for me staring me down like he was 
[00:39:00]  the catcher and i was stealing home this kid is delusional he's got this thing built up as a big  moment lopez was out before he got to the plate he said he wasn't trying to ruin the ceremony for his  classmates but celebrate their achievement with uh his stunt shut up a lot of people came up to me  outside the stadium parents even saying it was their favorite part of the day of course it was  yeah what else sitting there in the heat watching people you don't know get a diploma right it was it 
[00:39:30]  was an honor to run on that field yeah it sucks for the parents you got to sit there for hours just  to hear your kid's name yes you don't care about anyone else's names no uh lopez's dad said am i still  reading this lopez's dad said he was at the ceremony didn't realize the man being arrested  was his son he's not like that clark lopez said he's a very sensible guy is he uh nyu spokesman john  beckman begged to differ yeah that's bad this is the first student in our history who's gotten a bfa and 
[00:40:00]  a d-a-t in the same day whatever that is uh said beckman referring respectively to a bachelor of  fine arts degree oh and a desk appearance ticket ah calling lopez's lope on the field disappointing  beckman said we're we're a community and we expect uh members of our community to abide by the rules  lopez who lives oh my god all right enough  that that that's too much coverage yeah five paragraphs it's unbelievable there's still five 
[00:40:30]  paragraphs left yes because now they go into the history of his life where he lived and blah blah  blah uh let's go to jeff in jersey jeff morning boys hey man i gotta tell you i haven't heard a story  this compelling and this exciting since bob kelly told us about guatemala yeah exactly  all right oh wait michael j fox was there michael strahan was there yeah michael j fox an honorary 
[00:41:00]  something oh geez honorary paint shaker  terrible another martini please yeah  oh all right just i like to think of him back in the marty mcfly days where he's just  unshakable marty mcfly that's gotta be hell on earth though man oh that's gotta suck i i hear  some of these people it gets so bad you just can't sleep anymore because you shake yourself awake all 
[00:41:30]  really long that is hell on earth because it's like with a lot of diseases and stuff at least you get  sleepy time to kind of dream of being a healthy person and banging hot broads and running in the  fields and climbing mountains and doing whatever the hell you like to do and then you wake up with  the horror that is your your your life but can you imagine having this and you can't even like go  into dreamland to get away from it for a while when the hell did this happen well it was a couple of  years back poor guy all right uh club soda kenny is uh away on business actually he's seen his son off uh

[00:44:00]  i'm looking at uh our prep sheets you know yeah we do prepare our asses off for this radio show  and some days  are easier than others it's basically what i'm saying is it's a slow news day yeah yeah for the  most part i mean american idols down to the final two listeners uh viewers damn it  see i i i was a good joke too i don't know what you meant the final two 
[00:44:30]  viewers i said listeners first screwed it all up yeah i'm so eager to get that out  you got david uh archuleta who's gonna win the whole thing he was gonna win the whole thing when  this first started six months ago yeah he's your next american idol it's very obvious  and then david cook who's just a mess mess of a of a person he looks way older than he is 
[00:45:00]  very greasy really yeah but america loves this david archuleta  i have no idea what's going on in american idol and i could care less and and i was like  a huge fan a couple of years ago you're the one last year and then this year didn't watch  probably watched one episode at the beginning i don't even think i did wait a minute i probably  didn't it was the same old crap and i i just couldn't be bothered now they're thinking of what 
[00:45:30]  eliminating the whole uh audition segment uh to make it move a little faster they'll just show  they'll have the people picked and then show highlights of them auditioning things like that  yeah they're gonna have to retool the whole thing simon came out and said that they got to retool  the whole thing yeah it's not when they have too safe he said and when they have theme nights they  got to like update that with uh more current artists oh god it's like all right and theme night  here's tony bennett dolly parton night bunch of tony bennett songs uh no one cares no all right 
[00:46:00]  enough about that who cares uh i care about this and and anthony made a good point about this one dog  the bounty hunter show is going to return to annie this summer they're bringing it back first in  reruns and then they're uh gonna start uh with new episodes some of those new episodes from uh  the season that was canceled yeah so um yeah i i don't know we're gonna see a different dog well  this is good for entertainment in general trust me yeah no matter what side you were on in the dog  the bounty thing this is very very good for entertainment in general it's another sign that perhaps some of these 
[00:46:30]  corporations are going you know something we got to make some money let's do business and not be  held hostage by some of these uh interest groups right and uh and uh more good news for us sue simmons  is not getting fired for saying uh you know throwing the f-bomb out there and now she's saying that  she absolutely was joking with chuck scarborough she thought she was taping that and chuck scarborough her  uh on-air partner was doing something and and she then said what she said around and did that 
[00:47:00]  something for the gag reel or christmas which is thought which is very believable because she  likes to have a lot of fun at her job wild and she's also insisting that she doesn't go and drink  in between newscasts like they were saying yesterday in the paper go home and do some shooters you come  back and so she she's not gonna get fired because you know good she's had a long history of doing the  right thing so how far are we from being able to do something real stupid up i'm starting to i'm starting to 
[00:47:30]  think maybe we could uh do something stupid oh yeah i think it's time to start what uh  it's time to flex our muscles again start pushing the envelope a little bit oh yeah you know see what  we could get away with oh yeah how about no exactly i remember this is a much better reputation than  this you'd be the sacrificial douche i remember having a moment with jimmy uh we had to sit out what  make it sexy close to two and a half years we're doing that sex for sam thing we're back on satellite  radio for a mere couple of weeks oh god yeah and i suggested that we get a couple to have sex 
[00:48:00]  at a uh at a mattress store yeah they would there was some and jimmy sat me down he's like dude  what are you doing like what the same guy i just commiserated with for 26 months about how depressed  we are and now you want to just want to blow it up finally get back on and one of our first stunts i  forgot why but something was going on and we decided it would be really cool if we got a couple 
[00:48:30]  to just have sex you know you know how you could try out the mattresses bounce on them a little bit  uh-huh i think it was something like that we're going to get a couple to have sex in a in a big huge  uh you know mattress store this is what i deal with behind the scenes it's like being a kindergarten  teacher just trying to rope everybody we can't do that we're going to no no no come  and it's not time nap time nap time sit down and it's not stuff that's like uh oh let's not do that  boys it's stuff that would get us axed in a second yeah yeah sex publicly would get us in a second  it wasn't like he said let's throw a water balloon at a bus 
[00:49:00]  i i remember going yeah jimmy i think you're right i'm sorry uh we talked about the edwards thing which uh  you guys were saying that obama's gonna pick edwards for the vice presidency huh sure yeah it's a great  choice hillary stinks and they don't buy edwards a good-looking kind of presidential looking guy  and uh people would feel he's a white guy he's not a radical young guy white guy goes good with uh  obama it almost looks like a 80s buddy movie kind of a thing oh yeah picture him in the presidential 
[00:49:30]  limousine going oh you know whoa whoa i think you blew it you think i went too far i'm gonna say you  blew it right nope nope there was no t that's right i think you blew it no t so you think it'd  be like a buddy uh flick yeah that's that's that's a great way to look at it yeah well they're driving  around yeah and uh you know saying i'm getting too old for this and things like that i think it would 
[00:50:00]  uh it does well yeah blazing saddles blazing it's like the who says that johnny mills said it's the blazing  saddles ticket they could call it the president said it got dumped yeah come on no i'm sorry  asshole whoa god i hate that you you did actually see you off but he just reacted he heard it and he  probably it was it was it was she it was it was literally the word she you you you had your toes 
[00:50:30]  in the water i'm telling yeah toes in the water i was taking that chance of pushing out the envelope  ah your mother see look we're not gonna get fired sue simmons uh exactly she said she said uh yeah  she said the she said she now we're gonna run out of dumps yeah she made the f word well i want to  say it though unbelievable because we're shark jocks that would have been fun today no uh anyway uh so uh  obama edwards ticket and it sounds good obama edwards in 08 or 09 yeah yeah what year 09 i guess 
[00:51:00]  oh uh 08 because you like in 08 sure yeah yeah we'll go obama edwards 08 yeah it was pretty safe  i think right there's no real scandal with him that i know of he was just kind of boring yeah but he's  perfect hillary's changing her tune hillary warns her supporters it would be a terrible mistake to  vote for mccain over obama but she's also saying she might take the presidential race into overtime at  the democratic convention what she's she's not gonna back out anytime soon when's the convention 
[00:51:30]  she has no momentum she's got nothing going on for she sweeps uh uh west virginny yeah and uh she got  that for maybe she got the publicity and and a little press going for it for about an hour  mm-hmm and now obama rules the day by getting the edwards endorsement he constantly keeps her in  check she can't get any momentum just leave the race already get out and uh selfish d and uh well 
[00:52:00]  there's two more other things to talk about as far as politics today sean penn well thank goodness  he's out there and is out there fighting for us for all of us what is he saying today that  there's something stupid that this is the most important election ever he said this is the most  important election uh of course in my lifetime but uh quite possibly ever in history was he living in 
[00:52:30]  the 1800s yeah i think there were a couple of important elections uh early on you know when the  whole country could have just been gone that was maybe kind of important yeah yeah who was that  terrible campaign that lost to lincoln i mean what a what a self-important ass yeah i want to read  the sean penn stuff because he's he's always a treat uh could you that means move up the copy there uh  you rock thank you uh penn joined fellow judge natalie portman on the red carpet for the premiere of the 
[00:53:00]  first night film uh blindness a thrill starring julianne moore at a press conference beforehand the actor and outspoken  critic of the bush administration offered his views on the democratic nomination race asked if he would  be joining other hollywood a-listers and pledging support for obama penn gave him a less than ringing  endorsement and warned that he has an awful lot to live up to so he's not uh he's kind of he's kind  of uh endorsing him but he's giving him a little hey you watch out because sean penn's going to be 
[00:53:30]  watching you i don't have a candidate that's pretty much what he's saying yeah i don't have  a candidate i'm supporting and i'm certainly interested and excited by the hope that barack  obama is inspiring he said but went on to accuse him of a phenomenally inhuman and unconstitutional  voting record i hope that he will understand if he is the nominee the degree of disillusionment  that will happen if he doesn't become a greater man than he will ever be what what what is he saying 
[00:54:00]  i hope that he will understand if he is the nominee the degree of disillusionment that will happen if  he doesn't become a greater man than he will ever be penn said this is the most important election  certainly in my lifetime and maybe ever  well uh he's in france i guess yeah um but he's uh he's not gonna stay there for long and they asked  what his plans are me and nick are gonna wing on over london and jam with the stones well all right 
[00:54:30]  that sounds fun yeah uh and speak but let's party this this is the guy we're supposed to listen to by  the way relax all right my old man he's a television repairman got the ultimate set of tools i can fix it  you know he doesn't even want to acknowledge he ever did that no and his best role ever well and if  it wasn't for that no one would be listening to what sean penn has to say all right hamilton the year 
[00:55:00]  2008 no baby he's turned into a baby yeah he he's got no he's got no sense of humor whatsoever  what was that awards show where the host said something about an actor rock teasing jude law  jude law right at the oscars a couple years ago yeah and sean penn had a stick up for jude law even  though it was obviously a joke yeah it was a joke that jude law is one of our finest actors today and  he goes yeah by the way just want to say jude law is one of our finest actors it's like it's chris 
[00:55:30]  rock doing it he's hosting the show you idiot he's supposed to do jokes he's trying to make it fun you  know he doesn't know what a joke is instead of a bore fest what a self-important dollar he really  thinks he is so important in this world boring hey yes boring moving on to obama did he have to  apologize for saying sweetie uh can we all use that word is uh jimmy uses it all the time i think hi  sweetie i do it's a good i think yeah but he calls guys sweetie that's yeah but that shows you that 
[00:56:00]  there's no gender problem i think obama actually was doing this i think he probably does the same thing  um if i could find the uh article he had to apologize to a reporter do do women hate that  word um i don't know i bet uh lesbians probably don't like hearing it um because they don't want  to be known as yeah and i bet they want to be known as tart i got the article here yeah all right  uh-oh jimmy looking to head off a possible sweetie gate democratic what page what what paper 
[00:56:30]  is this it's on uh nine of the uh daily news all right he was uh in detroit he was doing a tv  appearance and i guess the reporter asked him a question as he was walking by and he went hold  on a second sweetie we're going to do uh we're going to do press avail he said this uh uh reporter  uh peggy agar look up peggy agar let's let's go look at her let's see if she is indeed a sweetie  she ended a segment with the uh news that uh this sweetie never got an answer to that question 
[00:57:00]  and uh footage of obama walking away and shortly after three o'clock i guess uh they were blogging  about it just the country of sissies we really are uh people were blogging about it there was a  buzz about him calling her sweetie he called her cell phone and apologized um he didn't have to do  that but he's what shut everybody up wishy what you know what though it shows this wishy-washy  cave-in attitude in in the in the olden days hey what do you think we could get the  it would have said that we could get the apology why don't we have it it's on their website i think 
[00:57:30]  teddy roosevelt would have apologized to somebody for saying sweetie absolutely not cracked her in  the head with that big stick absolutely not you think fdr would have apologized for his legs just  kind of hanging there looking and stupid running over a woman's toe and saying i'm sorry sweetie  of course i just have to make fun of his legs for the sake of doing it yeah you actually put a joke  there you inspired me jimmy thank you sweetie let me call jim oh jimmy i'm sleeping huh call back 
[00:58:00]  and uh this is what obama said that you can get the uh voicemail it said that that's a bad habit of  mine i do it sometimes with all kinds of people i mean no disrespect and so i am duly chasing on that  front i didn't mean to call her sweetie i meant to say exactly exactly i don't even know if she  made a big deal about it or she was just kind of breaking his chops about like if she's just saying  that everyone's looking for their attention she's like oh i could uh i could uh get a little attention

[01:02:30]  overreaction to sweetie is that we need american refugees we need american refugees it'll weed out the  people that that can't cut it that's what we need then we'll be back to basics then the guy at the  garage can put some pinups in his toolbox mm-hmm that's right yeah that's what we're going the guy  at the cubicle can maybe put some uh some fun uh uh mimeographs mimeographs on his uh cubicle wall

[01:03:30]  nudity on copy machines again exactly without the threat of being fired wouldn't that be fantastic  where two men can get by the water cooler and not care if some skirt walks by you're able to still  tell that filthy joke you read in penthouse those are the good old days my friends  talking about the new uh receptionist right in front of her that's right that's what i'm talking 
[01:04:00]  about the glory days of this country and that ain't coming back until we weed out the week with a a  major tragedy that causes them to uh leave with ox-drawn carts what kind of major tragedy though i'm  thinking tidal wave um big title yeah tidal wave is only coastal we need something like um some type  of uh massive nuclear mishap dude yeah what's wrong with that i'm not talking about terrorism i'm 
[01:04:30]  talking about like there's a screw-up i'd rather see monsters monsters yeah monsters now you're being  unrealistic i live in the ground monsters i want a big i want a big hole to just start slowly opening  and we just don't know how big the hole's gonna get that would kind of be cool that would rock  yeah tremors the worms and tremors yeah you don't like a tremors problem oh we'd be able to say  sweetie and all sorts of things because we would be distracted by those big wormy things that's what 
[01:05:00]  we need a big distraction so wormy things let's call it a big wormy thing and that would last a while  that would last uh well nukes would last a while too yeah i don't then that nuke thing scares me i  want some what about just like a plane is flying some nukes like it did uh recently accidentally  transported a nuclear bomb and it kind of falls out and and blows up in the middle of the country and  a nuclear cloud goes over and people have to leave the cities that's what i'm talking about no i'd rather

[01:08:30]  i'm a whole american and i want  sweetie you know how fast as a man my campaign would be derailed oh please amazing oopsie yeah  all right let's yeah kevin s notice  kevin s from akron noticed that you used the reference uh that was a little more updated uh  jimmy and they're proud of you out there oh toy story so you're getting there i didn't mean that 
[01:09:00]  though i meant march of the woods and soldiers yeah oh which is 1937 or something like that i  met the laurel and hardy it was oh my god did you go back it was pointed out yesterday that jimmy's  references are all uh what pre-1990 yeah i don't mean to be that way yeah and then this guy got excited  because he thought wow toy story is after 1990 but before 2000 but you're getting there yeah eagerly awaiting  your steamboat willy reference you already hear my huck finn ones 
[01:09:30]  over explained it didn't i yeah well it happens uh we got uh mcfoley one of our good friends uh in  the green room oh good well he's just on the tv how could he be in there he's here because he was  excited to get right over here to do radio i gotta tell you we used to have a green room but we got  those those dopes from cbs fm down the hall now i don't think we really need to say that  a bunch of we need to call them dopes a bunch of creeps we met him after a corporate function  i don't think creeps works either uh these guys find people from cbs fm people out there got it 
[01:10:00]  all wrong man they work for the oldie station here in new york and a lot of people oldies anymore is  it ah well they went back to it's not like real oldies it's it's whatever i was thinking oldies still  is it's it's 60s 70s and 80s now okay uh a lot of people got it wrong they think you and i are the  devil and we got two heads and we're like just complete complete lunatics we met these uh the  gang from cbs fm and they scared us yeah very frightening we met a pedo an alcoholic and someone 
[01:10:30]  that beats uh beats their wife all all on the street after the corporate event i don't know if you can  confirm any of that um i don't know where that's coming from to tell you the truth and i was thinking  to myself if people are scared of us some of these people need their backyards uh dug up the crawl  spaces bunch of creeps cbs fm yeah yeah so they took our green room yeah they so who knows where mcfoley 
[01:11:00]  is what are they doing in the green room they built their cbs fm cbs fm studio oh yes i didn't  even notice that that was the room you're talking to thin air iraq yeah yeah iraq just no one hears  you speaking of which is merciful on some level our green room go ahead sweetie  no no you said it wrong go ahead meaty  i'm sorry what do you got iraq that's where their uh transmitting equipment is now yeah green room's 
[01:11:30]  on the other side of the building wait to we get these uh these creeps on our show when are they  starting to broadcast officially like next week or something uh we'll get the we'll get this crew in  here you're gonna be uh pleasantly surprised there's something going on with these guys we'll get to the  bottom of it yeah big fans of the show though so maybe we should be nicer to them some people need  to learn about hair trimming like nose and eyebrows really yeah i don't know what that is 
[01:12:00]  and some people they reach a certain age where they just say eff it here's something if you want  to continue getting laid when you get older you got to trim all that stuff up nice yeah you don't  want this little explosion coming out of your ears or out of your nose i think there's a rabbit  living in his ear the giant eyebrows look like some kind of uh rhododendron coming out of his nose 
[01:12:30]  your eyebrows shouldn't be able to poke yourself in the eye no that's a bad thing ever all right  we gotta take a break mcfoley is just wandering around the halls because we don't have a comfortable  place for our guests anymore he's a nice man i'm not even a wrestling fan he's a nice man i love this  guy actually he's very entertaining we'll have him on next and uh william shatner will be on the show  today as well yeah uh opian anthony oh welcome back to the opian anthony radio program here in 
[01:13:00]  the morning based out of new york city of course mc foley has come in studio and he's promoting  smackdown uh friday nights at eight o'clock on the cw and he was just on channel 11 yep and uh  anthony goes wow mc foley's looking more and more like a caveman every time we see him well the hair  the beard and then now you've got some kind of leopard skin print shirt on it looks like you uh 
[01:13:30]  you bagged it yourself it would look hot on a on a chick at a at a whorehouse like a like as a like a  like a night coat or whatever they're called where do you think i got it oak  i don't know what that says about me i specifically picked out the best shirt in my wardrobe for uh  today's tv oh no getting flack for it i remember being of the one and only time i was on leno uh  in that case i picked out my best uh it was best non-flannel brought it to california the first thing 
[01:14:00]  he said is hey make it thanks for ironing your shirt for me when you go out of your way to pick  your best shirt and you still get flack that's not a good sign right yeah yeah but you know you don't  care about that type of thing in general right i do care you do i do but i look like it no i i do care  yeah as a matter of fact i just spoke to mr mcmahon about maybe uh you know making my wardrobe a  little more presentable without alienating the people who like me for having no wardrobe how would 
[01:14:30]  you do that suits you're not a suit guy accessories accessories accessories it's like carrie bradshaw  nick foley's gonna get some fashion advice from sex in the city  yes i'm thinking a big flower yeah or a big acorn hat yeah you gotta walk down with a big acorn hat  we got a great angle for you for the smackdown you should be like the new carrie bradshaw with with  your accessories okay i was thinking one of those big madeline albright brooches yeah brooch does her 
[01:15:00]  name come up very often very often that could be the first time that her name has ever come up on our  show and we've been doing this for a long time i'm madeline albright joke wow that is true though  a lot of people uh would probably go like what's he doing he's selling out to the corporate man man  well no i specifically what is the purpose of what is the purpose of the brooch i don't want to let  that go just yet brooch you know the metal big pin yeah what is the purpose it's to draw attention 
[01:15:30]  away from the young madeline albright's face i think the uglier you get the bigger the brooch gets  yeah because you don't see hot young girls with brooches i haven't heard the word brooch in quite  some time another word that doesn't come up no if you're gonna use words like the brooch like brooch  you might want to do the interview with the guys down the hall that's serious thanks for the great  green room guys where were you i was hanging out in the office with sam oh god that can't be a treat 
[01:16:00]  oh did he talk about his wrestling career i just saw sam as sam had a wrestling there he is oh yeah  yeah yeah oh he's multi-faceted yeah when he's not wrestling the worst thing i'm in the office and  i see this sign that says opie's microphone must be replaced before and after each show  oh god why is that and they prepare to tell me what a germ factory these microphones are and how 
[01:16:30]  you never actually see a healthy looking disc jockey except for norton you know yeah that's  the problem i mean we all get sick through these dumb microphones so we all have our own now well  actually you you get uh a lot of colds and stuff throughout the year i've been pretty good lately  but i and i think that's because they replace i think it's because they replaced the mic you got  to suck in those germs so your body can kind of build up a resistance to it holla has this microphone  been replaced no recently no i'm out of here yeah i'm not sucking in a microphone no you just did 
[01:17:00]  you just did channel 11 here in new york city oh yeah and uh we're big fans of jill nicolini and  for a while there we're like what's going on with jill but i think she got her ass back into the gym  jesus oh and she she lost the little baby fat that was starting to kind of like grow around her  belly area and she's looking really hot the last few days looking really hot and i come with a message  for anthony oh from jill from jill jill wanted you to know two things about herself stop harassing me

[01:27:00]  jill nicolini picture you just found what is this on our myspace yeah all right uh we're gonna change  gears for a second because we got william shatner calling in in a few minutes but mcfoley i gotta tell  you something sure we uh jimmy and i saw morgan spurlock's uh movie basically a movie on where's  uh osama bin laden okay so he went uh across the middle east to a lot of really scary places the one  thing that came up over and over again during his film was that the fact that these uh people living 
[01:27:30]  in the middle east they love wrestling who knew i did i i've known that you know anything about that  yeah because uh you know we've wrestled in uh oman and uh dubai and kuwait and i always felt like  wait a second this is the number one show in israel and it's hot in dubai oman yeah kuwait isn't there  hope for world peace honestly like if it wasn't for the fact that we'd probably get killed uh i would  put on a piece uh vince would organize some type of peace show yeah sure bring uh bring uh 
[01:28:00]  how'd they treat you like dubai instead that's like a great place well you know what it was everything  was top notch uh the crowd wasn't so great and this is back in 90 you know 97 and but i noticed  that when we were driving back to the hotel we were escorted by like 20 police cars and i was like geez  you know why you know usually it's a fan control thing i said why we need so many uh cars there  really weren't that many fans i said oh it's not for the fans it's the bomb threat oh wonderful oh  oh that's right we're in a scary place wait how many fans were there was it was it small i mean it's 
[01:28:30]  like you know 10 000 fans but it was a big soccer stadium and uh i have to tell you you know i try  not to be biased against any uh particular group of people but i did find that being spit on by  someone in dubai bothered me worse than being spit on over here what does that say about who spit on  you just a you know a fan you know when you're going by you launched a loogie on me middle east loogie  it wasn't a conscious decision it was just like that gut thing like oh i didn't like that yeah 
[01:29:00]  like although uh undertaker was just reminiscing about when he had a staph infection and uh  in uh puerto rico and the doctor squeezed it literally puss across the room uh splattering  against the wall and then i said yeah and then when we went out to wrestle i walked down there was  this overhang uh you know in puerto rico i walk out and immediately i feel like 16 ounces of not hot  enough to be coffee but just warm enough to be body temperature uh cascading down my neck and 
[01:29:30]  shoulders uh and i have to say that uh that bothered me even more than the middle east loogie wow  sorry i just middle no no not at all memories let's bring up jill nicolini no  but you know what that is an amazing thing that they love that guys uh uh because he was walking into  homes and stuff and they all had wrestling on and they just they just eat it up over there yeah and  uh seriously i mean there there's i would go on a goodwill mission i mean i know we do the stuff for  the the troops every year but if there was a way that i could go and do some type of goodwill work 
[01:30:00]  in the countries over there i mean we want to change hearts and minds right politicians you don't think so  you know i generally think pretty little of us even though we had all three candidates on uh  on raw a couple weeks ago but i would do that in a heartbeat that was a little rough  that was maybe we should talk about that for a few minutes that was a little rough there were too  many wrestling references you know we're big fans yes you know yeah joe knows that joe brings everyone  by that was a little rough the uh rough in what sense well they they sounded so awkward and barack 
[01:30:30]  obama everyone says he sounds like the rock it's like dude why don't you study some rock tapes and  really sell it you know but instead he had to play straight laced which was which was kind of a bummer  and and do you smell what the rock is cooking yeah that's what he said do you smell what barack  is cooking what barack is cooking at least i believe that was his only reference whereas  hillary came on loaded like uh you can call me hillrod and mccain had like 18 different things yeah 
[01:31:00]  if you smell what john you know and then he was using barack's catchphrases after he already used  them yeah yeah they tried to overdo it a little bit a little bit too much pandering i appreciate and  then the hillary then you had hillary and obama wrestle or look-alikes and uh the obama character  had the big ears pince mcmahon is completely insane he came out with those huge ears prosthetic ears  i have to say i was not a fan you know how fired we would get for doing a bit like that on the radio 
[01:31:30]  and i thought jeez you know he barack does have those big ears but i was like i know and and no  one thought ahead and said okay let's get some exact barack looking years yeah they got like the  the dumbo ears yeah like at the last minute like where do you go for prosthetic ears on like one  hour's notice uh i got a kick out of it because i thought everybody at the moment bill clinton tripped  uh barack and especially when he uh fled up the aisle right right side of danger that that people 
[01:32:00]  thought he would be a good wrestling manager the ratings were good man vince knows how to sell his  product that's for sure all right uh you're sticking around right yeah because we haven't even plugged  uh the pay-per-view i have to yes all right we're gonna do that we're gonna talk to william  shatner he can help us with our will were you were you a star trek fan growing up  no no really i wouldn't he beat up star trek fans what were you a fan of growing up if it wasn't  like and like i wasn't really into star trek growing up and definitely was kung fu kung fu movies 
[01:32:30]  no no the show kung fu jane kane with oh oh the actual okay right snatch a pebble from my hand  kung fu incredible hulk uh comic book heroes and i did i got into star trek for a little while but uh  after i saw william shatner make love to women of every color and i'm talking about green blue and  orange color uh i thought okay i've seen enough there's a time too especially during the time of  kung fu and stuff where star trek wasn't really out there as a big thing and had a resurgence kind 
[01:33:00]  of in the mid to late 70s after star wars and stuff uh so during that time i remember watching  those shows too incredible hulk and uh kung fu things like that but i became a star trek fan uh afterwards  kind of a little later and i thought a couple of the movies were excellent yeah yeah okay we're  gonna talk to him next we're gonna talk to mcfoley a little more uh let's not forget about uh judgment  day this sunday live on pay-per-view opian anthony what a day what a day it's the opian anthony 
[01:33:30]  show we got mcfoley in studio william shatner calling in seconds and uh somebody has a crush on anthony  i think it's a crush you got a little sunshine in your face right now doesn't he mick look at him  he's got a little glow he's not the same anthony we started the show with you guys and of course  soon as uh soon as we went to break eric got the naked jill nicolini pictures for everybody  anthony's like that's my girl 
[01:34:00]  but this is legit right there will be a date in your future or at least a little dinner maybe  a couple drinks look i'm not gonna be uh uh telling you guys anything you said you would  do it for the show so this is part of being the show and anthony forevermore i want you to refer to  me as cupid you're a cupid i got a great idea mick come on in to my office i want to tell you 
[01:34:30]  something i was listening on the ob and anthony show and you're you're pretty good at hooking  people up that's right you're gonna be cute man get your bow and arrow and get out in the ring  or you're fired i want to see vince make mcfoley go to the mountains of pakistan to find osama bin  laden he might be a wrestling fan you never know a lot of uh wrestlers uh right fans uh over there 
[01:35:00]  in the middle east get over there mick and go find him find him or you're fine  but vince no but  you know i got this uh this uh announcer on smackdown deal uh we're talking about during  the break i think about anamorph did we mention it on the air uh yeah uh no we did not uh we saw the  movie uh william defoe willem defoe was in here to promote uh anamorph yes uh i it was it was really 
[01:35:30]  cool to see you in the movie it was a very short scene i'm looking at jilla in the background yeah  look at her i'm so envy anthony look at her she's doing the traffic look at she's on tv  oh my goodness look look at that hey what are you doing you guys are hysterical look at look at  that what the hell what the hell we're saying about nothing changes she knows that we're watching  her now too you can tell in her body language oh really anthony i'm doing the traffic for you right  now i know i got a lot of viewers but i'm talking to you directly through the tv she's telling me that 
[01:36:00]  alternate side parking's in effect now she's talking right to you she's like the tunnel's locked so if  you want to get into the tunnel you're gonna have to drive hard and fast i think we could change  that no parking uh side by the way to something else yeah jesus yeah all right uh let's uh adam  morph with uh well yeah and i went you had a very very uh small scene in the movie and i was excited  i thought you're you would have a bigger role because your character looked like it could have been 
[01:36:30]  something it could have they could have fleshed it out a little bit uh some great scenes were lost in  the cutting room floor there it was it was brief but when i went to the premiere i saw i was like  excuse me and when i walked by this woman i was like i think that's debbie harry from blondie and  she played a smaller role than i did but that's right afterward i actually was going to go i was  going to go directly home because the you know babysitter was uh running a little late and i thought  you know what that'd be rude to not stop by and uh and say say hello and the moment i said hello to  the vince he was mick i've got an idea how do you feel about announcing on smackdown so uh i went 
[01:37:00]  home and i thought like that was real that may have been fate you know i mean maybe he would have  called me the next day but you never know vince is kind of like a gut player so it may have just uh  have uh become an idea at that moment so uh you need to uh uh be back and wrestling full time i know  you don't want to be doing the matches anymore but your personality is is just there's too large to  to not be part of that whole thing man well now i'm part of it i know part of it and it's you know 
[01:37:30]  we're happy for you yeah it's awesome i mean i'm 10 feet from the action and i grew up as a huge  fan and so i really enjoy it and i think part of the reason i did well in wrestling is because the  fans who watched knew that i loved it and enjoyed it and then hopefully they can tell that when i'm  doing the commentary are you uh are you a achy mess every morning when you get up from like just old  injuries i never consider myself an achy mess but uh i am in some degree of discomfort if that's  what yeah there were sometimes what's what's the one injury that just nags every morning where you're 
[01:38:00]  like oh man why did i jump from from that building yeah um is it one of my hip you know what knees uh  knees and lower back uh but mostly the knees uh stairs are not my friends really so definitely  especially going down the stairs it's worse than going up we have a phone call yeah from bill uh  bill yeah well bill we'd like to call you bill because we feel like we know you yeah every time 
[01:38:30]  i hear uh friends talk to you it's always bill shatner it's true so i want to call you bill shatner  yeah who are you talking to uh who's the wrestler oh mick foley mick foley yes really hello sir how  are you really well make yourself oh good thank you he's a huge fan of uh star trek he was telling us  just before we went to the phone uh the thanks and uh would you like to ask him a star trek uh  question mick foley being the huge fan you are and we can get the star trek stuff out of the way  and move on to other things they're putting me on the spot here bill no no here's here's here's the  question here's the question that you have answered i've got a uh an autobiography out there yes uh 
[01:39:00]  that started yesterday and uh that was fast it's called up till now you can read that and all your  questions will be i like how you handle that and it's good for your knees as well you know that was  very smooth i didn't even notice you were going into a plug there i prefer to call it uh an achy mess  that's exactly how many uh volumes of memoirs for you is this well this is this is the first uh 
[01:39:30]  first probably only one um i've written several books but they've all been on other subjects or  or about star trek or something like that but this is a this is a snapshot of my life and uh  it's getting great reviews and and uh and uh getting popular and uh it's something uh that i think you'll  enjoy reading can i tell you i've been perusing the book it's jim norton yes jim and um there's uh  the one my favorite thing in the book in the photo section this is a really cool photo of you and 
[01:40:00]  leonard nimoy just eating off paper plates both dressed like kirk and spock i like the behind the  scenes stuff yeah no that's uh it's it's of interest uh thinking there's no thinking there's no  behind the scenes stuff that is real see mick it's not real it's all pretend  what hey i know what we have in common bill you were at uh the uh wrestling uh hall of fame  inducting jerry the king lawler i was you've kicked a little butt inside wwe rings in the past that's 
[01:40:30]  exactly right i learned a few holes and and uh and uh pal around with vince mcmahon and uh all that kind  of thing well who hasn't seen uh bill shatner duking it out in the engineering section of the enterprise  uh where sometimes i could swear it didn't even look like you well it was me and i got so filled  with myself i thought i could uh i thought i could fight and and uh got accosted by three young guys  and i could take these guys and and just before i pulled my fist back i thought wait a minute i'm an 
[01:41:00]  actor yeah yeah this is not a stunt man i i love watching some of the old uh the old shows and and  watching those fights where you know occasionally they would replace you with somebody very rarely  very rarely no no i all those cool roll moves you you would do i know were you yeah and uh and when  your young body bends it's good but as uh mick will testify as you get older the knees start to go 
[01:41:30]  that's true so i went on to do uh broadcasting and then you went on to win an emmy  so you gotta move on right you gotta move on that's it and let the knees take care of themselves  it's true though but your body begins to ache in various places and um and i i don't know what you  do uh stretching is a really good thing hey uh bill i uh i learned something by quickly turning to page  119 of your fine book up till now the autobiography of william shatner uh on the bookstores right uh yeah i 
[01:42:00]  went into a panic and i said i better find something i i turned to page 119 it says right  here nbc turned down the star trek pilot how could they have done that well uh they did uh it uh the  story is that the gene roddenberry made a pilot with an actor named jeffrey hunter who was very popular  at the time and uh it didn't sell so but the nbc was continued to be interested in it and they  said make another pilot with a whole new cast except leonard nimoy so they came to me to play 
[01:42:30]  uh the captain kept leonard and um and we made a second pilot and that sold and uh then later on  incorporated some of the original pilot into another program that's exactly right yeah in the uh in the  uh not to waste money uh they use the old pilot and uh and uh suave uh an actor's face in bandages so  he could continue to play the jeffrey hunter rosary it was so clever it was yes a clever uh 
[01:43:00]  um a thing that they did captain christopher pike in that stupid chair with the beeping light  oh bill i'm a fan it was all about money it had nothing to do with of course  so in the years that have passed since the show has ended have you heard any like interesting stuff  about george takai that you might not have known at the time yeah everything i know about george  everything i know about george is not interesting oh wow let's just let's just put it this way uh 
[01:43:30]  when did you know when he made his announcement at the age of 70 wow really you had you had no clue  no well who cared i didn't i wasn't examining him yeah you know there were too many pretty girls  around why would i be well that's true wondering what what his uh policies and i hear you didn't really uh  enjoy um maybe partaking in some of the groupies back then well the the groupies who were numerous 
[01:44:00]  and beautiful all wanted to sleep with captain kirk and um and that wasn't me oh boy i kept imagining  what it would be like to wake up beside this guy that didn't quite fulfill your fantasies what  what was the retribution there that's jimmy yeah the beautiful but the thing is though you win who  cares kirk was a dud beat it i had to discover that you don't win it's all very painful 
[01:44:30]  um it's early morning here better go to sickbay  somebody's passing a salt shaker over my throat right now  uh salt shaker yeah and uh of course uh your your kidney stone you sold or it was on put on ebay  for charity well i passed a kidney stone well in uh boston legal and um and a a uh gambling a  website gambling uh company uh golden golden palace golden palace dot com sure uh they would get their 
[01:45:00]  publicity by doing these odd stunts they bought a a cheese sandwich with the face of christ on it  uh yeah you know about that one so they offered me fifteen thousand dollars and and i uh if i  remember i got them up to twenty five then when the publicity hit about selling my kidney stone  they got about a hundred thousand dollars worth of uh in my opinion got a hundred thousand dollars  worth of publicity they gave me seventy five and i the seventy five and uh the cast that christmas 
[01:45:30]  collected twenty we had ninety five thousand dollars we gave it to uh habitat for humanity  and they built a house and a family is living somewhere in new orleans as a family living in  a house that that kidney stone bought that's nice yeah well i wish i still had my right ear i could put  a couple of my kids through college with it well but but you could sell it as a vegetable a cauliflower  do you have any new albums in the works i mean uh these five albums uh the album that's been 
[01:46:00]  out there for a while is uh has been and uh gets a fair amount of uh airplay but that's in the past  the present and the future is up till now and my autobiography hey i i didn't know this until today  uh you did the first interracial kiss on television back in 1960 oh jesus of course what do you what  come on you're talking to bill shatner here you should know this was there a lot of outrage when this  went down originally i think there was uh in certain places in in the country uh uh some protest i i 
[01:46:30]  believe if i remember correctly they uh some of the stations in the deep south didn't play the show  wow that all that's uh in the past in the country's past that doesn't happen now do you address that in  up till now the autobiography yes a lot of these things all the questions you're asking are addressed and  and i tried to do it as um as amusingly as possible so that there there's some laugh out loud places  there uh i'm told as well as uh some more meaningful stuff that uh i tried to uh communicate to you to 
[01:47:00]  the reader was there any uh any resentment like uh you know they said that james uh duann and george  uh and a couple of the cast members have said that you might have been a little uh hard to work  with is well i might very well have been i uh i think if you ask uh a wife or two uh i very well could  have been but i think after a lifetime it's time to forgive forgive and forget but uh yeah there's 
[01:47:30]  a bit of pathology well you guys do you go through in the book do you go through uh you know the making  of some of the movies and how it was to get back together with uh yes with the crew i tried to touch  on some of the major aspects that people would know about and do some explaining and do it with uh  laughter in mind and uh i'm told people read it and laugh out loud and and have a good time reading  the book so that i if if that's happening i've achieved what i will attempted to do i'm a huge fan  i can't wait to read the uh the whole thing cover cover to cover my friend yes your favorite moment 
[01:48:00]  would you say it was on star trek or doing the nude scene with angie dickinson that was big bad  mama right oh yeah you mean if it was a choice between seeing george naked and angie dickinson  i was so envious i kept thinking i wish i could be angie dickinson right  that's funny who said that mick foley yeah of course mick foley hey thanks bill i appreciate that 
[01:48:30]  and of course then moving on to uh uh very successful tj hooker a lot of people uh don't  remember that you were you were in that a lot of people don't remember yeah of course they do  you think star trek he was hooker are you crazy that was a huge show i think star trek sorry bill  well no that's true i can understand you gotta excuse anthony he fell in love uh today and uh 
[01:49:00]  he's a little distracted so uh jesus he fell in love today yeah when they uh up on the elevator he  saw the book the one no can i explain this to bill yeah maybe bill will care i'm like this is mick  i'm like cupid uh bill i was uh over at uh channel 11 uh talking to a wonderful young lady who does the  weather name jill nicolini traffic traffic traffic i don't uh and i came over with a direct quote and i  said anthony jill nicolini wants you to know two things she is a available and be interested 
[01:49:30]  and uh they got they got her on the horn and we set up a little uh love connection live live she's  hot yes exactly you didn't think of me in that moment i don't know what what do you think bill uh  how do i handle something like that i think you've handled it exactly right getting a married man  involved with the weather girl it's just uh so boston legal is a is a big hit for you too it's it's  amazing you just keep everything you touch it seems to work well not everything what doesn't 
[01:50:00]  work i mean take george the kite for example no she she hasn't worked in a while that didn't work at  all um it's i've been lucky in a and a and a few instances very unlucky and many others believe me  uh but uh boston legal is coming back next year and uh and we'll start working on that in a month or  too and i'm looking forward to that and and jj abrams he wants you in the uh the star trek movie  but what's going on with that well i don't know it's the weirdest thing they're making another star 
[01:50:30]  trek movie uh it's the young the uh the young versions and uh and they uh they i guess they  couldn't solve the writing problem of how to bring back the dead captain to the live captain the young  you know it is complicated i will admit but uh so i'm not in the in in the movie and to my uh deep  regret uh but abrams is such a good movie maker i'm sure he'll do something wonderful sure oh we  couldn't have you like maybe as as his dad or something yeah you'd think you know a disembodied 
[01:51:00]  voice but i guess i uh i guess not yeah we could have done something but uh you and i but no you'd rather  do with jill well actually i i think uh me and uh bill should go out maybe uh no no no that was jill  not bill and now playing the role of angie dickinson will be anthony oh my goodness 
[01:51:30]  we just saw a still from big bad mama and and bill you're an animal man you got her pinned up against  the bedpost i'm telling you she's nude she drove me nuts wow i'm to get it was  look at bill holy jeez bill back time you want to wow god bless mr skin look at this my next call is  to netflix what were you doing to her she you're pinning her head down everything she could think of  which was like serving tea you are treating her properly yeah she used to be hot man she's fantastic 
[01:52:00]  and that's the terrible thing you know you have an actor who uh like her who was uh as a young  woman was so beautiful and the aging process on everybody is is awful yeah you don't know that being  young punks but but look at mick i'm youthful because right now i'm transported back 28 years to uh  angie shower scene and uh what was the dress to kill dress to kill the opening scene 
[01:52:30]  keep me awake for weeks that was only 28 years ago 28 years i preferred the elevator scene but  the shower scene was hot too i've got ties older than that you look that's the oldest joke in the  world you look very good you look very healthy well i'm healthy that's good god bless yes well it is  we'd have bill shatting around for a while jesus we just learned that he's healthy that's uh getting a  a lot done here that's big news there's another netflix 
[01:53:00]  listen we're we're standing around talking and meanwhile the book is flying off the the book show  you have a book out what's it called i was hoping you'd you'd remind me it's i'm getting older  up till now yes how did you know that i was just something that this is hot off the fresh you know  what he's talking about is i'm going to use your book title in a sentence right now okay please do  bill up till now i thought i was a shameless self-promoter 
[01:53:30]  but now you know yourself to be a shameful so ashamed of yourself so i got a i got a little plug  in for my last book on uh on smackdown but it wasn't nearly as subtle as yours yeah no and smackdown  is a really good word up to use that in a sentence now up till now it's basically covering everything  up to the present uh exactly well yes covering as much as possible in 400 pages or whatever it is  yeah bill you're gonna do some book signings for this or what i did a book signing at uh barnes and 
[01:54:00]  noble and at the 92nd street why uh these last two days uh there must have been a thousand people  uh at barnes and noble yesterday last night uh and it went extremely well and uh and i'll do  another one in los angeles at the book soup uh in los angeles on sunday and then i think that's it  well uh where are you at with the trekkies these days you like him you hate him no they're always  been neat to their why are we laughing i'm trying to find a word that was a that was a perfect word 
[01:54:30]  perfect word they need they tuck their shirts in and all that kind of stuff uh it's good you know  star trek uh the conventions have fallen off uh the popularity has waned and it's going to be  interesting to see if jj abrams can uh re-establish star trek in the consciousness of people with his  movie did you ever see uh galaxy quest i did what did you think of that i thought it was very funny 
[01:55:00]  yeah i i didn't like the way his uh uh alan's uh little tummy kept sticking out there  i didn't like that well who's he doing there with my washboard abs of course i remember the scene  where you had to go in for the exam in uh the sick bay and uh bones is giving you and you're you're  kind of peddling that thing on the wall with no shirt on oh were you buff i was buff then  i remember every scene look at me you sound a little obsessive actually oh bill i'm probably uh 
[01:55:30]  one of the biggest star trek fans ever oh that's great i was one of the uh jackasses that bought the  um dvds when they came out one episode per disc and yeah uh we're removed by telephone here  what does it say about anthony when they're getting a date with jill nicolini is the second  best thing that happens to him on the show hey you know i i have my priorities 
[01:56:00]  i have to i'll have to tune into channel 11 and take a look at what's your next date yes certainly  where are you gonna go certainly will i think there's a nice place uh around uh what do you  think of this bill i i suggested a nice restaurant that's kind of near my house  because we both live on long island oh really uh but long island is long it's an island that's long  yeah but but uh it's close enough we're within proximity of each other there so i suggest something  near the house and then it will go out and then and then hey how about you know i show you uh because 
[01:56:30]  i'm having some work done on the house having a pool put in the back and you know and here's the  side benefit of all that you can go on a date and the weather will be nice see yeah when should we go  well let's see the sun will be out uh on thursday so let's go and sit outside and dine al fresco yeah  so i'm thinking uh that that could work that could very well work and here's another suggestion carry 
[01:57:00]  your cell phone with you and record everything so you can play it on the air the next day  oh that'll i'm sure that's gonna go great the the ratings will go through the room i won't get  picked apart here by uh everybody yeah but who cares we'll get the ratings as long as jill picks  you apart yeah yeah oh well i mean you're saying you're gonna be picked apart and should i be anthony  from the radio or the regular anthony that i am in regular life don't i i can't really give you 
[01:57:30]  advice on that just don't be anthony the anthony on the radio don't don't be this one no no he just says  no don't hey we we updated uh jill nicolini's wikipedia it now says on july 19 2007 jill appeared  live on the opening anthony show a little romance has sparked with anthony as of may 15 2008  jesus that's on the wikipedia you guys are brutal is that is that a text uh yeah now it's you get  texted on that it's on wikipedia it's on wikipedia it's on wikipedia yeah it's official i'm looking 
[01:58:00]  through your autobiography it's called up till now really and uh yes and there's actually a really  funny story about getting blasted by a skunk it's really well written  well i'm glad you think it was well written it was it was it made quite a uh a smell uh there's  something there's a joke there somewhere i can think of it yes uh but the story goes on a bit uh  uh probably too long until on the air yeah uh but it's true and in order to uh but to cut to the 
[01:58:30]  chase uh in order to get rid of the skunk smell uh it was late at night on a deserted road and there  was a store nearby i bought several cans of tomato juice which is supposed to take the the the smell  of skunk out and i poured the tomato juice all over me and i was walking back to my car somebody was  driving by called 911 to uh say somebody had been in a car accident covered in blood  that was part of the story yeah the book looks really good absolutely it's not some 
[01:59:00]  it's not some cheap uh biography i mean this is like a oh it's way of sharing yeah no no it's not  a cheap biography man it's very expensive actually yeah no but you got to say that because a lot of  a lot of celebrities put out books and they're like yeah but this is actually it's well written  it's just it's a beautiful piece of work well uh i'm gonna uh take accept the the truth of the  words and ignore the sarcasm in those no not at all no sarcasm it actually is uh you know and it  has nothing to do with the fact that i i wrote a book was a bestseller who cares it's not about me 
[01:59:30]  this is actually a really uh a great looking book i'm not being sarcastic it has nothing to do with  the fact that i wrote a book which is a bestseller too uh bill we're we're he's being honest i was  looking at his face yeah yeah well i tell you what we do when the uh first flush of the sales of this  book uh are over we could combine all three books for price of one nice right hey uh bill i noticed  you forgot to thank us in the book uh no you're under another name oh okay it's father and mother

[02:01:30]  dickinson about captain kirk but he is there he is there on a purpose to sell books he knows how to do  us we don't feel that way with you even though you only come around when you're promoting something  but you know i still feel like we're friends when i you know what i saw a big kev and uh sam last week  at uh prime time that chill yeah is that his nickname uh sam's a sam yeah prime time sam roberts and uh  and i said yeah you know i have such a good time you think can i just go in when i don't have something 
[02:02:00]  to plug and he said yeah they would uh love to have you there but to tell you it's true that i was  haunted remember i i introduced the show at uh the uh traveling virus show and that was the first  time i'd ever been booed unintentionally like i've been booed when i wanted to go out there yeah and i  i specifically said all right this is the worst joke you're going to hear all day like and you think  they're going to wait to hear the bad joke and like after about a minute it was the okay the polite  applause we like you we know you from wrestling and ona but get the hell off the stage type of thing 
[02:02:30]  and i was like i mean i was i was a little bit hurt i didn't realize and you would know  you got to kind of pound that audience into submission right uh they're animals they really  are what's the guy a boss is that the rich uh he came out uh after me and i thought the bottom line  is you know let's get ready to chuckle is it pretty good let's get ready to chuckle right  right you said that yeah it's a good yeah  oh instead of rumble yeah exactly yeah 
[02:03:00]  and i set it up by saying like you know i was a little uh hesitant to put over uh you know do a  take off of a dx thing you know they're kind of rude and they uh they they uh you know they say suck 
[02:03:30]  it without a please in front of it which is just not good manners and i pointed out this is a pretty  cool story being at disneyland and uh my wife says mick i think poo bear is trying to communicate with you  and i look over and there's poo bear and they're not allowed to talk you know and he's like this  he's kind of like moving his arms around like this guy's trying to communicate with me non-verbally  and all of a sudden poo bear just goes boom boom and he hits me like three crotch chops you know which  were dx's sign and i thought that was a pretty cool story and they were boo boo and when i did that 
[02:04:00]  get ready to chuckle you know i was like almost like i can't i'm not feeling the love here but  they're great crowds but they're also animals remember it was in the studio where we had like  the the comics come in and audition oh you're here for that yeah car crash comedy car crash comedy  yeah lewis was here uh yeah it was it was a great we're gonna bring that back we weren't even gonna do  the comedy uh tour this summer but we did so well at the show you were at the pnc they wanted us back 
[02:04:30]  and they said come on you guys gotta do it again so we are and we're excited about we're gonna i think  we're gonna have the lineups up on onaradio.com or the comedians that you could choose from we're  gonna see yeah we're gonna see uh who the uh listeners want to see this summer so mick when  you thought of let's get ready to chuckle had you thought of that beforehand i thought of it on the  car ride over i was like hey you know when stingers announce him let me tell a bad joke was that your  fail safe though like like when things are going bad pow this is the one i knew it would get booed  i just didn't know but i thought it'd be like that good natured hey yeah mick's willing to make a 
[02:05:00]  fool of himself mick anytime you want to get up and punch jimmy in the face i'm actually curious for  for just goofing on you i didn't hear that at the moment so this is all i but we've all had  those things that you think like all right this is the one i got to use in case things go wrong  and when then that gets a zero it's like oh boy well here's the thing i knew it was i wanted to get  booed for that and i prefaced it by saying it's the worst joke you're gonna hear all day i just didn't  realize their patience would be that short before but during car crash comedy we watched like six seven 
[02:05:30]  guys for whom this was the biggest moment of their lives of course you know they're auditioning  the guy who won here was actually very good and when he went out there on stage i mean my goodness  compared to him what i got was a love fest like i don't feel so bad now and then you know and then i  saw i watched the show and saget was great and uh and uh lewis was great and norton was okay too  so you're gonna have to go to the jersey show this summer i will go to the jersey show all right 
[02:06:00]  good judgment day oh yeah right what do we got for judgment day okay i got it out of the way i  don't have the lineup for i don't have the matches i have it committed by heart uh the big one since  i'm uh on on smackdown is uh the undertaker and edge for the held up version of the world heavyweight  championship and it should honestly be a you know a great match and fans are really into the story  and the guys and they will put on a tremendous uh match i know and then triple h and uh randy orton 
[02:06:30]  inside the steel cage for the wwe title uh sean michaels and chris jericho uh has a lot of  emotion on it uh sean michaels believe it or not was feigning we're not allowed to say the word fake  on our show feigning a knee a knee injury and uh uh jericho called him on it and now they got to  settle it in the ring oh boy in addition some other great matches uh jbl cena but uh  the two main ones are the uh world title matches uh undertaker and edge randy orton triple h 
[02:07:00]  inside the hungry cage hungry cage is vince doing anything vince does everything behind the scenes  oh we know that but this is we need him in that not even wrestling just doing his thing to kiss my  ass and all the buffing of the ass was probably one of the funniest things ever ever with the  the little guy buffing his professional buffer getting his ass all ready uh  i had to kiss that ass yeah we know mick man that's why we can't figuratively and literally  literally and if i could talk yeah i've been doing it for like 15 years all right i might as well do 
[02:07:30]  mick uh i think prime time sam roberts um put this list together mick has suffered the following  wrestling related injuries oh my i don't all right having to sit in a room with sam  six concussions from 1986 to 1998 one broken jaw two broken noses same nose broken twice one  broken uh cheekbone uh lost four front teeth i didn't actually break the cheekbone but 
[02:08:00]  close badly bruised all right i counted it two-thirds of his ear ripped off of course a  separated shoulder true fractured left shoulder true dislocated shoulder yes second degree burn on  his shoulder yes second degree burns on his arm true 54 stitches on the shoulder shoulder and arm  were the same injury okay burns 54 stitches on his left arm true where can you see the scar i don't  smoke oh sorry scar oh all right there they are let's get ready oh wow yeah that's from a variety of 
[02:08:30]  those matches the i'll do anything to pay my mortgage when i was in uh japan and uh and you  know i got some stitches in the chest wrestling against uh rick flair a couple years ago and it  was actually not that's getting stitches is cool but i went to a mets game like uh two days after that  it turned out a carlos beltran had had a a party at his house where a summer slam party and so when i 
[02:09:00]  went back uh after the uh the game all the mets were coming up to me you know like little kids and it  was cool because i had my son with me and i used to be his hero and then there was that one day i  walked into his room you know like seven eight years ago i was like hey what's different about  this room and then it dawned on me my posters are down oh no dad's been taken down but on that one  day with uh new york mets walking up and looking at my stitches you know i was he thought that was  pretty cool pretty cool uh a broken right wrist bone chips in his right elbow six broken ribs a torn 
[02:09:30]  abdominal a torn acl a broken toe that sounds like it would be the worst one right there that was when  i was like six months old so i when i got into wrestling and i had only had a broken wrist and  a broken toe i had to play up that toe injury right yeah tough guy over there i never heard the  ear story i honestly i thought you were i didn't i oh no that's the real deal yeah what happened  now he's legendary for that one you know what um i was uh doing a move i went for a clothesline and uh 
[02:10:00]  my head got caught in between the ropes they kind of intertwined and we were in i think oh munich  germany and uh i'm not to blame you know not i tried to blame wcw and the lawsuit didn't work out so  well uh but they'd had a road crew wrestling road crew uh who tightened them so they were actually  tighter than they probably should have been and so when you take those actually steel cables covered  by uh rubber you intertwine them there's very little play so when i squeezed my head out uh my 
[02:10:30]  ear just kind of didn't oh god wow it was pretty grizzly and uh the the odd thing is people would say  they would try to make the mike tyson hollyfield comparison i said you know what the difference is  they were making eight ten million and the fight was stopped immediately and i was making like 350  dollars and we kept going do you bleed from the ear you know i knew i was in trouble because  actually i'd done that move and uh it was kind of my move no one else would do it because i had been  uh showed up in emergency rooms had the back of my ear stitched you know several times which should 
[02:11:00]  have been a sign hey maybe take that one out of the repertoire but because the ear is mostly cartilage  it doesn't bleed that's what i'm thinking but on this night when i went out to the mat it was like this  pitter patter of bright red against the little blue protective mount i was like oh that must be bad  and then we rolled back in the ring and we finished the match and at the end of the uh  you know match i reached up and i was like oh man you know i gotta admit you know it was like kind  of a sinking feeling and apparently you know you guys have been around me i'm not much you know on 
[02:11:30]  cursing in general especially the f-bomb i think i dropped an f-bomb uh when quoting uh adam west as  batman uh on xm on you guys but i got to the back and the guy said it didn't look like i was forlorn i  looked like you know i had the adrenaline going and i said i think i just lost my half in the ear  bang bang where is the ear did they get it well that was the deal uh the woman um they did about  four hours of corrective surgery and when we pulled up to the the you know the hospital after we got  rejected from the first hospital i guess they didn't have a surgeon on hand this is where the uh you know 
[02:12:00]  the high school german comes in handy because i was like vergessen the next bit of mine or in the  plastic tashutsu bringing which means please don't forget to bring my ear in the plastic bag  and uh you never thought you'd need that one i didn't think i needed to pull that one out i  thought they were crazy when i had to do that that was one of those dialogues that you had to memorize  back in 10th grade but i do not know that's one they remember from back in the 30s though  probably true uh but i i wish i'd known the german word for formaldehyde because uh the nurse came in 
[02:12:30]  and she showed me you know the ear which was basically just like skin it looked like uh like  cold uh the the cheese on a cold pizza after the kind of field and i was saying uh you know  you know which which means i'd like to keep my ear please and she said nine like she holds her nose  saying it's schmutzig and i was trying to think but i can put it in a little jar of formaldehyde you  know like formaldehyde and as i'm talking she uh she steps on the little steel you know the little pedal on 
[02:13:00]  the the garbage can and the lid lifts up and she throws my ear out in the garbage can and then after  she after remember this is after she's thrown my right ear in the garbage can uh she looks at me  and she says their catch is all the schauspiel which means wrestling it's all fake and i was like you  know if you have the right one time to have the benefit of the doubt it's after the lady throws  your ear out in the garbage can why did you take it out of the garbage can i just i wasn't thinking i 
[02:13:30]  i guess that's true i'm looking for logic so what would they replace did they do plaster or it's just  no no you know i was thinking about it you know and uh but let's face it you know like fans while  they will forgive me if i start accessorizing and wear a nice vest at the table uh eventually  maybe if i want to have my front teeth replaced they might uh you know accept that but i think the  moment they hear that i went in and have a new ear put in there they're like you know sold out  yeah yeah you sold out you sold out having an ear put in you had teeth knocked out too in the 
[02:14:00]  ring i didn't know that uh you know a couple of were knocked out in a car accident i had to make  that uh shocking admission in the first book but uh a couple more were knocked out in the undertaker  match and here's here's a dilemma i know the music's signaling me off okay we got a little bit  uh matt striker on the ecw show said that you know most people's eyes are a window to their soul  whereas my smile is a window to my uvula you know the little punching bag and when i smiled  on camera i watched it back and i was holy crap my my teeth are yellow they look like john mccain's 
[02:14:30]  teeth you know how mccain like i i i respect that that even though he's running for president he  won't have his teeth cleaned uh i respect that he doesn't have time he's too busy working for america  the one uh tooth that was knocked out was put back in but it's kind of turning gray on me  and uh you know i knew it was bad when we were watching a a disney movie about a boy and his  dog with my kids and they started calling me old yeller oh no it's not bad right you're crying  i'm gonna tell that joke this summer it'll kill it'll kill it'll go good especially when you 
[02:15:00]  when you say old yeller you gotta throw your arms out like this they started calling me old yeller  and then you pause and wait for the laugh well mick it's always a pleasure you you know that uh  you're now doing the smackdown thing friday nights at 8 p.m on the cw and also uh judgment  day on pay-per-view this sunday yes yes but most importantly i am cupid  yes he he has helped uh look at it she's on tv waving waving i feel like she's waving to me 
[02:15:30]  waving all right guys and mr matt won't be the only guy with a swollen head  wow oh hey oh whoa with that we're off to xm have a good day  the world of radio shock jocks the biggest are opie and anthony these people say shocking 
[02:16:00]  things that border on offensive uh in order to entertain their office i refuse to sit here and  think that radio has to be nice why why does radio out of any other medium have to be nice we are  being now held to a standard where we have to be nice and make people feel good go screw  radio bad boys opie and anthony controversial radio personalities opie and anthony infamous dj's

[02:17:30]  people are uh talking about our mcfoley interview on instant feedback i gotta say uh well first of  all dickie punchcock uh writes uh wait wait real name yes it is punchcock is the dickie and heard  from dickie in a while he writes uh mc i hope you don't wear glasses which is uh very very cruel mike d  from queens mike i swear i forgot this until i just read this uh hey hope why don't you tell mc  foley how overrated you think bruce springsteen is we would have had we would have had a great 
[02:18:00]  discussion with mc foley about bruce springsteen i forgot uh now i remember that he is a huge uh  springsteen fan and uh and other things okay where do we start first of all anthony is in love uh  we could no there's no there's no uh there's no love thing between uh miss miss nicolini and i  you know you're downplaying what happened this morning on the show but i don't think i'm down  playing you realize i i could say this much that the uh the gossip uh magazines not the magazines but 
[02:18:30]  some of these gossip people in new york yeah are smelling story here and uh they might even print  something well in tomorrow's papers well jesus if you're just tuning in jill nicolini who we've  all had a crush on let's be honest well jill is a she's a very attractive uh she does the traffic  for channel 11 here in new york city i remember from the days when she was like the announcer  girl at the coliseum for the islander games and she would piss off every single woman in the place 
[02:19:00]  yeah uh when she would walk from section to section you know doing her thing because she would  lead with her huge boobies and then the smell after she passed would linger for a long time  because she had the best perfume ever yeah and the women would all start just folding their hands as  they're wearing their what are you looking at as they're wearing their oversized uh islander jerseys  they they would fold their arms in disgust because their man was uh taking a peek at jill nicolini  well now she's uh she's a big star in her own right she's on uh on tv and she's been in playboy and 
[02:19:30]  all sorts of stuff uh we learned today that uh jill nicolini is available and interested in  anthony cumia well i guess you know word got out that uh and mcfoley set it up because mcfoley  said mcfoley relayed a message right well he was doing uh channel 11 here in new york with jill jill  goes you know oh you're going over to open anthony well tell anthony i'm recently single which is 
[02:20:00]  perfect by the way you know that right yeah the old rebound the old i gotta get back at somebody  uh jesus and uh and she's in a better way than a shock jock and she's interested so i can't wait  to see the gossip headlines uh channel 11 uh uh traffic girl loses all self-esteem  and they'll show her walking and then you just kind of carrying her bags 
[02:20:30]  like one of those suitcase pimps that hangs out with this chick who's stripping of course  this is this has got to be very very bad news for keith keith the cop cannot be happy with what's  going on today oh why what are you speculating here what are you what are you thinking that  you're going to be kicking keith out of that house immediately wait a minute who the who right  keith man just in case get your fucking stuff out of my house get out out keith because when i  give the tour i don't want her uh seeing any other guy stuff in my house you're gonna ruin it 
[02:21:00]  so tour and i like like it's already set in stone look i know you play your cards very tight to the  chest there but uh is it safe to say that you'll at least give her a phone call and see maybe if there's  a potential there to go out for a drink why wouldn't i all right there you go you heard it  here on the opian anthony just like anybody else i would uh call and then go out for a drink of  course of course uh shawnee smith checking in and i thought i meant something to you 
[02:21:30]  fuck you and uh poor shawnee sorry someone's saying that jill was on sex and by the way it's  and the city not sex yeah uh don't forget jill was on sex and the city that was probably the  only good part uh of the show ever i have no idea well you know they probably wanted to make it uh  you know new york yeah she's a fixture here in new york so well uh all right a couple phone calls 
[02:22:00]  then we got to move on to bob stokes i can sean in jersey what's up yeah um hey and i had to ask you  a question man yeah when you you were talking to uh shatner you mentioned the pool was that was that  a jab i was wondering if anyone saw that man that was just i was cracking up dying hysterically i'm  like oh my god man what a set of balls it's just all i said was i had a pool yeah we kind of had a  conflict with uh bill shatner we really liked the guy a lot and we really know we'll take you inside 
[02:22:30]  the show a little bit we really want to ask him about you know that horrible tragedy that happened  to his wife yeah finding her at the bottom of his pool back in the day i think that was like in the  late 90s but we i don't know what are you gonna do well there's not much to say about it other than  the fact that he'll probably just say it's very yes it was tragic i mean if you asked him a legit  question i'm sure he would answer it but yeah there's probably not much you can comment on yeah we  were sure how to get there i'm sure it has to be it's gotta be in the book uh anthony jersey what's up 
[02:23:00]  hey how's it going guys good hey anthony i don't know about this girl jill nicolini what do you i  mean she looks like a go-go dancer i mean yeah that's terrible a go-go dancer where are you from  i know i understand that 1968 just called it wants its vernacular back i love when someone calls  like a year or something that couldn't possibly call and it calls you and asks for something back  always funny it's possible it's 1968 it's a year it couldn't call you they chill out man 
[02:23:30]  getting a bit defensive here oh yeah hold on sir to sir with love called  go ahead anthony just keep it in check man i don't think she's anything that  that you should uh you know bring home to mom or anything like that you know what i mean what's  wrong with you she's smoking hot she's large yeah but not for me i mean she's smoking hot she looks  like a freaking from mommy my mother was bringing home pictures from baseball teams so what the hell is  it uh for me what's your point dude like why wouldn't you want to why wouldn't you want to 
[02:24:00]  bring a hot chick like that home for your mother she's a really pretty girl she's got a great career  to go to go-go dancer you ever date like girls like this before i mean she's also all aggressive  she's calling you and asking you out and she'll go dance dude what kind of chick do you have honestly  what kind of chick right now i'm single all right calling boys going out with boys  yes sitting in parked cars with boy uh be careful off of a relationship to jump into someone like  that that girl can that girl can chew you up and spit you right out i'm telling you  we're just making back to the future references 
[02:24:30]  travis and danny can't get enough yeah thank you anthony let's go to jimmy in east meadow jimmy  yeah oh yeah i want to know if uh anthony's gonna make her a big wooden j  linger longer oh are you gonna make her a j in woodshop wait did i wait why why is that a  linger longer i don't think i ever did that you're an old tin knocker maybe you could like make some  kind of j out of ah right out of ten yeah that'll happen uh make her a flask john long island  how's it going guys hey man uh you know what the best thing about this uh jill brod i guarantee 
[02:25:00]  that if anthony was still a tin knocker she'd be going out with him  what a little dose of reality john that doesn't that doesn't mean that anthony shouldn't go out  with her that just means that anthony should be grateful he's in radio you the beauty when you bat  out of your league and no offense hand but she's way out of your league uh but that's the reality  the wait wait wait jimmy can i slow you down a little bit what do you mean by way out of his  league like let's say he's got a whole bunch of uh i'm trying to you know stick up for you like 
[02:25:30]  if jill nicolini's in the major leagues where would anthony be anthony right now will be coaching t-ball  and have questionable photographs on his computer  so that would be way out of your league he'd be walking around a bunch of little leaguers doing  the cup check using his chin um but that's the beauty of being a a brilliant radio guy see that's  that's that's that's not a knock uh i've dated girls who are out of my league and i never think 
[02:26:00]  gee she wouldn't like me if i was that's like good thank god i'm here i know what i look like  physically i'm average i'm not bad looking i'm average and it's an average guy but he's brilliantly  funny and that makes him a nine and a half good for you jimmy i gotta tell you it's really really  the cock of his deserves exposure i gotta tell you it's really tough to go through life being  really good looking so oh christ let's get ready to chuck oh yeah can we get that drop oh i'd love

[02:39:30]  weird i got a bunch of i got a very very small connection to this guy uh bob stokes we both  started together he was like a local um weather guy in rochester new york when i was doing uh radio  at wcmf and we actually did an event together at the uh minor league ballpark what was it a rape  the rochester the rochester red wings back in the day when kurt shilling was pitching for them  judging by these a little too much info i understand but he was there as well 
[02:40:00]  judging by these transcripts wow mr stokes is my fucking everyone knows there's a weather channel  sex uh harassment suit uh bob stokes was sued and he lost and the network lost it uh what was her  name the one who because you said something like uh hillary andrews we we brought to the story uh bob  asked her will you lick my swizzle stick right yeah that was nothing and that's nothing this is  bob stokes who used to be on the weather channel he was like the main guy yeah kind of like uh he had 
[02:40:30]  a little asian in him i think it was part asian part something else just so people have a visual  of who this guy was he was on all the time well he asked her does she have any asian in her and uh  she said no and he goes would you like some  you want me to read this or what all right sexual harassment scandal which rocked the weather channel  is coming to an end after hillary andrews won her lawsuit against the channel and bob stokes the  38 year old former anchor who left the company now works for cnn filed a lawsuit against the weather  channel alleging sexual harassment by co-anchor bob stokes the details of the lawsuit remain 
[02:41:00]  close to public eye but leaked uh court documents reveal that her co-anchor bombarded her with  sexually suggestive comments including the now infamous will you lick my swizzle stick now um  yeah that's nothing compared to the other things some of the excerpts that he has are really amazing  this is one of my favorites he didn't even try with this one to make it even rhyme sound like  something uh mr stokes repeatedly made crude sexual comments to me this is her excerpt from our 
[02:41:30]  deposition uh in the guise of discussing the weather including and i quote tonight looks unusually hot  with a chance of boning  what the fuck does that even mean is this your phone call to jill nicolini no i'm not gonna say it  looks unusually hot with a chance of boning you gotta do something with traffic the next one yeah the next  one's great i'm sensing a high pressure system forming in the deep south and make like the santa 
[02:42:00]  ana and gently blow me oh my god these are things he said to a hillary andrews deposition uh while i  was right my this one you're about to read is one of my top two favorite things yeah top two yeah ever  read well uh i was reporting mr stokes routinely replaced the map of the u.s on the studio green screen  with nude photos of himself flexing get the fuck out of here pictures of his cock and balls as he's  flexing she's trying to point to where the storm front is headed and she's gotta look at his stupid 
[02:42:30]  dick on a green screen how fucking idle this guy is during the march 9th 2006 broadcast of our national  weather roundup mr stokes never once took his eyes from my breasts he just stared at her the whole time  uh mr stokes described my unwillingness to have sex with him to a producer by saying she's got a  high dew point it's all weather pun everything is weather puns with this guy we need traffic puns 
[02:43:00]  for you and jill oh the listeners get working on it we don't feel like working today you do all the  lifting by setting me up with an assignment which later proved to be fabricated mr stokes convinced me  to deep throat a barometer and since uh has since kept the footage playing on a loop in his dressing room  this guy's a scream how did he convince you to deep throat a barometer yeah what the 
[02:43:30]  fuck is that that's funny man um it sounds like these guys might have had some kind of uh a  relationship thing going on something and then it went bad and then he said fuck you uh during our  time covering hurricane hurricane katrina hurricane uh in new orleans mr stokes repeatedly tried to  start an impromptu mardi gras wet t-shirt contest with me as its sole entrant on several occasions he 
[02:44:00]  pretended to help bail out the flooded home of residents only so he could accidentally spill buckets of  water on me which he succeeded he invariably made a reference to his quote levy being about to break  and ran to the restroom come on this guy has every weather pun he's just a a punny guy he's a panic 
[02:44:30]  it's a regular riot can we get a picture of this lady can we find uh hillary andrews i guess she works  for cnn now yeah and this next one is just uh in order to accomplish this the guy uh yeah is  amazing wonderful mr stokes once told me that i had to go check the fluid levels on the studio's doppler  weather system when i returned he had masturbated onto my desk and was arching his eyebrows at me  suggestively how do you when someone walks in there's a load on the desk and you're like 
[02:45:00]  huh right i wonder who did that tapioca  he's just uh uh whenever i try to enter the studio through the hallway leading from the dressing rooms  mr stokes always stands in my way pressing himself against me and says warm front get it warm front  another weather pun and uh this one's great too mr stokes once placed smiling sun logos on the map of 
[02:45:30]  the eastern seaboard in the shape of me giving oral sex she's she's pretty uh she's pretty  i'm gonna say pretty hot but she's she's all right all they reported was will you lick my swizzle  stick right that that was the boy the guy's best jokes they didn't even get to yeah they printed his  hack joke wow fantastic with the weather puns though oh absolutely uh bob's he's able to whip 
[02:46:00]  those right out he got fired over this whole thing it sounds like yeah so wow she's hot yeah she definitely  is hot jesus i wouldn't mind raining in her mouth oh see yeah see well we're gonna go with some uh  traffic puns now for you and uh uh uh carl and jersey what's up hey and the first pun for you guys  will there be any rubbernecking on your first date well and uh i bet traffic's gonna be backed 
[02:46:30]  up because there's gonna be a toxic spill in anthony's pants yeah you guys there yeah yeah what's  up carl yeah hey what's going on hey i tell anthony that if the tunnel is closed you got to go around  the other way but don't get rear-ended what it doesn't even make sense what a nice tunnel is closed  bit he just didn't have it worked out somebody will work it out for you let's go to joe wisconsin joe  joe it's actually jeff i think uh right what's up happy birthday jimmy thank you hey anth i just

[02:48:30]  You're saying there's nothing there? 
[02:49:00]  It's not like...  Not gay.  It's not like gay.  It's just, yeah, stupid.  That song yesterday was so gay.  In my butt.  And the video and everything, that's gay.  That right there is some guy trying to be funny.  All right, why don't we go back to the phones then?  Bob in Atlanta.  Bob.  Why?  Hey, guys, how you doing?  Hi.  Anthony, you got a titty fucker and tell us about it, man.  Would you guys just knock it off?  What the...  Unbelievable. 
[02:49:30]  Jeff M. from Los Angeles.  Are Jill and Ant going to raise super kids?  Why?  Jay from Boston.  Jill's roads are slick for Anthony.  Not even clever.  Well, they're trying, Ant.  Yeah, and they're sucking ass at it.  You guys suck eggs.  It's Sam's hair.  What?  It's so big and fluffy and lamb-like. 
[02:50:00]  You're like a little lamb.  It looks good.  It doesn't look good.  Yeah, by the way, congratulations to Sam.  He has officially won Afro Wars.  Yes.  I don't care.  Dave has been going around here because he shaved his head.  Yep.  But he's been telling everybody that he still has an Afro.  It's a Todd Bridges Season 1 Different Strokes Afro.  That is an Afro.  But he specifically cut his hair.  Yeah.  Which was the whole rules of the contest.  That you're not allowed to cut your hair.  No.  The biggest Afro wins.  So he needs to come in here. 
[02:50:30]  I don't know.  Once we get this baby business out of the way, he needs to come in here and admit defeat.  Well, it's obviously lost.  We can't keep playing this dumb thing out.  He cut all his hair off.  I know that.  Because he's going to be a father.  It's over.  It's over.  It's done.  Unless there's still a competition between you and Danny.  I thought it was just show versus show.  He wants to cut his hair so bad.  What are you going to do with that hair?  How bad do you want to cut?  Stuff a pillow with it?  What are you going to do?  I don't know.  It seems like I should do something constructive with it. 
[02:51:00]  Sell it to people that lost their pubes in radiation accidents.  Donate it to Sam.  Somewhere along the line, Sam started enjoying this whole thing.  He hated it.  I guess it went through maybe an awkward growing stage.  But now I have a feeling you really like the fact that you got this big monster.  It's in, I think.  Well, because now it's an identifying trait.  Yeah, it is.  You know?  People see you and they go, ah, that's Sam.  Yeah.  And wow, that's the hair.  That's his famous hair.  On a social level, it's still really uncomfortable. 
[02:51:30]  Can you tease it out for us today?  Yeah.  How high does it get?  Wow, can you really, if you took a pick to that or a brush or something.  Yeah, I think I got my comb here.  Yeah, get it way up.  Yeah, get it way up.  We'll, uh.  All right, I'll be right back.  I'm going to see this.  All right.  Unless those curls just snap back like leaf springs or something.  Five hour energy.  Oh.  Uh, let's say hi to Jim in Chicago.  Jim.  Yeah, I want to go over there.  Jim would know how Jim McLeany would shift his gear shift at 180 miles an hour. 
[02:52:00]  What's that, sir?  Bit might be running out of steam.  Wait, sir, what'd you say?  See, they just, they suck.  We love when Anthony's in the barrel, but we might be losing steam here.  Oh.  Might be.  Yeah.  They're terrible.  Multiple cum pile up around.  I mean.  No, it's not even.  No.  How about this?  Yes.  How about we just let Anthony go on his date?  We don't throw any blocks up.  And then when he comes back, we discuss it like barbarians. 
[02:52:30]  What an interesting day.  We got Russell Simmons.  You want to take a break before Russell?  Sure.  Is he here?  Yes.  Oh, he just arrived.  Okay.  Let's take a quick break.  We got Russell Simmons stopping by to say hi.  He's got a new book out called Do You, 12 Laws to Access the Power in You to Achieve Happiness  and Success.  Oh, wow.  He's really good with self-help stuff.  Yeah.  He's a very bright, bright man.  And he's made, he's had quite a career. 
[02:53:00]  He's probably pulled in $200,000, $300,000 over the years.  Yeah.  All right.  They do love their catchphrases perhaps more than that, Jim.  This will not be over quickly.  You will not enjoy this.  Oh, that was fun.  Mike told me today we're back with the Opie and Anthony show. 
[02:53:30]  You can hear Russell Simmons in the background.  He walked right in.  He's a little confused.  He's like, is this a news show?  Because he sees that we actually watch the news.  I think that surprises a lot of people when they realize that we try to stay informed.  We got MSNBC on and CNN.  They got better graphics than Fox.  Well, it gets obnoxious.  Jimmy brings this up all the time. 
[02:54:00]  All the stuff that's going on.  You got the crawl, the breaking news.  You got the stock ticker.  You got the more than one logo.  You got to tell everyone it's live.  It's their lame attempt at competing with the internet.  Just having as much information as possible so you won't run to the computer and look up other stuff while they're boring you with a story you don't care about.  But Russell was talking about Bush.  I don't know what he said about Obama.  It was just the idea.  Are you watching it, Billy?  We're watching, but I didn't hear the quote.  We don't have the audio up.  It's just about the tanks moving in and people saying, I wish I had talked to Hitler. 
[02:54:30]  The inference is that we shouldn't talk to our enemies.  If we do, we appease them.  I think that whole fear thing is kind of done.  We're not safer now that we were, are we?  Eight years ago, were we safer or now?  What do you think?  What do Americans think?  I think we're a little more on guard now.  Or at least keeping our eyes open.  Do you think that we...  I think we felt safer before 9-11.  We felt safer.  After 9-11, I think we had a chance to promote world peace. 
[02:55:00]  Right after 9-11 was our opportunity.  Instead, we, you know...  You know what, though?  Scared the shit out of everybody.  I'll be honest with you.  I'll be honest with you, though.  I think a lot of people just wanted blood.  If you look back, there was an opportunity because we did have the sympathy of the world  at that point.  That's right.  But I think a lot of the people in this country wanted retribution.  They wanted blood.  They wanted revenge.  All right.  Well, that was a bad choice.  Well, in hindsight...  On the part of our leadership and on the part of the people. 
[02:55:30]  So now we can look at the leadership and say it was failed.  Well, we have to hopefully make a change.  Well, the method was failed.  But if we didn't get blood...  Don't forget, I mean, one of the reasons they say that al-Qaeda thought America was a paper tiger  was because when bodies were dragged through Somalia, when Clinton was in office, and there  was not as strong enough retaliation, it looked like America was weak.  There is an aspect of certain...  Like, if somebody attacks you, you kind of do have to hit back.  It's kind of hard to not...  Maybe the Iraq decision was bad.  Afghanistan was different from Iraq.  Yeah, it was justified.  Iraq was, you know, oil and a bunch of other reasons. 
[02:56:00]  And it's pretty clear now.  And they fabricated the reason to go in there.  I mean, the guy was on Good Morning America the day before he went into Iraq.  Iraq, and I had my liberal friends yelling at me and saying, the troops, they're going  to have their boots on the ground.  How dare you have an opinion?  I mean, I had an opinion.  I said, isn't yes okay?  I mean, that was Saddam's response was, do whatever you want.  Come in here.  Check my underwear.  It's all good.  And then we wouldn't accept yes.  We couldn't take yes.  It did get to the point where they weren't even... 
[02:56:30]  I mean, we had sanctions in place for so long.  The guy was being watched like a hawk.  He couldn't fly airplanes.  We had a no-fly zone that was huge for years since the original Gulf War was still in place.  Yeah, it was kind of odd that...  We had no reason to go in there.  Yeah.  And we know it now, and we knew it then, really.  Well, we were fed a lie about the weapons of mass destruction.  Yep.  You know, Colin Powell stepped in there and...  And he said, come and look.  It's all good.  See anything you want.  Wherever you are, you couldn't go before.  You can go now. 
[02:57:00]  And we still went to war.  Well, Saddam was bluffing.  It was a dumb move by him, too, because he wanted Iran.  He was terrified of Iran thinking he was weak, so he was kind of bluffing.  And even Hans Blitz said that, and he hates the U.S.  It's like, don't blow up my spot here, guys.  I got these guys next door.  He realized it was a real thing, but by then, I think the U.S. just wanted to go in, which  in hindsight was a wrong move.  And now that we know it's a lie, why can't we just get out of there?  Well, it isn't.  That's complicated.  Yeah, I know.  I got to switch the subject because, you know, my publicist is here.  And no, she's not wrong because, I mean, all my political opinions are probably a little 
[02:57:30]  value to your listeners, right?  That's not true, though.  I mean, it's like you're very honest about the way you feel.  I don't agree with some of the things you've done or said, but so what?  It's like at least you're honest.  At least you go out and express the way you feel.  And you're a best-selling author.  The book is Do You.  This is the paperback version of what was a bestseller.  I wrote this book.  It was like a cleansing.  I mean, it was for me, just something I had been studying these things for years.  And I wanted to put them down and get it clear in my head.  And then the book became a bestseller. 
[02:58:00]  So I see people in the street and they tell me it changed their life.  And I'm inspired to promote it more because more people, I mean, there's nothing really  you can give the world.  I mean, you can give them all the money or you can give them lots of charitable work  and some social work and you can change their condition.  But it's really their consciousness that you have to affect.  You know, they have to be able to see the opportunity.  And that's what the book's about.  How did you come up with these?  I mean, was it just a life experience from you?  Some, but just reaffirming what you already know. 
[02:58:30]  In other words, you know, what's in this book is in every scripture.  And there's nothing in, I mean, if the Bible and the Koran and the Torah and for me,  mostly Yoga Sutras reminds us of obvious truths that, you know, that we kind of forget.  And the practice of remembering these truths is what each of us is going through, you know,  and all the struggle and remember to walk in order, right?  So the Yoga Sutras remind me, and this book is kind of a simple way of restating the obvious,  right?  You know, like there's a piece of strength inside you that, you know, a piece of God inside 
[02:59:00]  you, if you will, that promotes all these books, these secrets and all these ideas that  people say about success, you know, and about happiness in life.  And this book is about that.  Is there a single most important thing that, as a person, you should do or adhere to that  will make you successful?  Yeah, I think, I mean, the idea is do you, right?  And you, the name of the book is do you.  And you, I refer to the Atman, you know, the higher self.  And that, you know, when you look inside for strength and you have resilience and anything 
[02:59:30]  is possible.  And that's the most important thing is to look towards that self, you know, that self that's  beyond the thinking mind and the struggling mind and, you know, and the doubting mind  and just look for the strong truth inside you that kind of promotes any miracle.  Isn't it hard, though, in this world, especially, I mean, life is tough, especially people looking  towards materialistic things. 
[03:00:00]  It's a little easier for people in certain positions where they do have money to...  No, I disagree.  ...to kind of look into...  I mean, just to look into...  Well, because people are, you know, happiness is what promotes, like, money doesn't promote  happiness.  No, absolutely.  Happiness promotes money.  So the happiness that you have, the abundance that you operate from is really the place that,  you know, really gives you strength and is attractive for more toys.  But you're born into a cycle of giving.  You can't hold on to nothing. 
[03:00:30]  And you can only sit your ass in one seat at a time.  So being comfortable in that seat, that's the thing, you know, that's the attractive  thing.  And then it gives you more things, and those things you give back, you know, you can't  hold them.  So it's part of a, you know, a process, you know, and the more you're comfortable in your  seat...  And more shit does not make you comfortable.  No, no.  It makes you uncomfortable.  You have too many seats, and you don't offer them up.  And money definitely doesn't get you happiness, but lack thereof can make you unhappy.  Well, if you think so, it's true, but it's not really true. 
[03:01:00]  I mean, you can believe it, and you can promote your own unhappiness, but that's not true.  I mean, people are more or less happy, depending on their connection to that self that I refer  to, that Atman, or that you.  And that's it, you know.  That's what it is.  You've got too many sad, rich people, and too many happy, poor people who believe what  you're saying.  Right, right.  And poor and rich is a spiritual state, you know.  I just mean, my personal experience has been, the less things you have to worry about,  the more you can concentrate... 
[03:01:30]  But you're not going to worry about shit, you're not going to starve.  No.  You ain't going to starve.  You might get overweight or something, but starving is not going to happen to you.  I was a working slob for many years, and I had jobs that I hated, and I lived out of  my car for a while.  But your job, though, is an expression.  It's not to pay.  It's the fact that you go to work every day and do something you like.  That's what it is.  Yeah, no, now it's great.  Believe me, I love this.  Right, so that's what it is.  I love this job.  But when I was working for a living, and really, I was crunched for cash all the time. 
[03:02:00]  That was constantly on my mind.  Would you need a hot dog?  I'm a vegan, but what did you need?  I needed, yeah, sometimes food, a roof over my head, things like that.  He lived in his car for a while.  He lived in his car for a while.  He was a tin knocker for many, many years.  Yeah, sheet metal worker.  It just made it hard to concentrate on the things that are really important in life,  like that would make you happy, because you had these constant distractions, if you will,  of just surviving. 
[03:02:30]  And that makes it difficult, I think, to...  I think the comfort in your state of survival is what makes you attract more stuff.  So if you're sitting in your car, and you really got the right mindset, you're in a good space.  But if you're sitting in a mansion, and your mind is twisted, you're really...  I'll agree with that.  Yeah, you can be happy or unhappy in any circumstance.  But anyway, the book's about getting money.  You know, Donald Trump wrote the foreword, so it's not a problem.  But the point I'm making is that to really get ahead, you need to get your mind right.  Well, everything you've touched, I mean, you've had some...  I mean, obviously, Def Jam Records, Def Comedy Jam, Fat Farm. 
[03:03:00]  I mean, have you touched anything that didn't succeed?  Because it's like...  Fuck yeah, all the time, you know?  I failed everything, but I go to work every day, you know?  And I don't really quit a lot, you know?  So if I'm working on something...  Like right now, I'm working on something called Global Grind.  And I've been working on it for a while, it's just starting to blow, but it took a long time.  Globalgrind.com, you can look at it.  You can't be scared to fail, is what it comes down to.  Yeah, you ain't gonna fail.  What are they gonna take from you?  The only thing you'll fail is your heart fail.  You just gotta get back in there and continue. 
[03:03:30]  I opened up your book, and I gotta read this, because it's really interesting.  This is Russell Simmons.  I don't belong to any particular religion or sect,  but I owe much of my success to finding time for prayer and meditation in my life.  I meditate every morning.  I like that a lot.  Yeah, it's critical.  You gotta sit still with yourself, you know?  And operating from stillness is also the same thing.  I mean, you know, the self is still, and like there's a little man inside you laughing and pointing at shit.  Like, it's not a problem, you know? 
[03:04:00]  And you gotta be able to connect to that little man, you know?  That really can see the world in its state, you know?  It's natural state.  Everything is kind of perfect, you know?  Four pieces of grass die, and what, eight or twelve grow in its place?  I mean, you really can't control it.  That shit around you is not so much a...  So, really, it's the self, you know?  And that stillness really helps you to connect, and there's where your strength.  That's the you I refer to again.  Yeah, we always feel like we have to move around or we're not doing something right.  You can move and be in stillness, you know? 
[03:04:30]  I mean, see the world.  You know, not so much future and past and shit running through your mind,  but seeing the world, you know?  Seeing miracles unfolding in front of you.  Look at it, you know?  And that's what the book's about, connecting to that space where you can see the world's perfection.  How do you feel about what's going on in hip-hop?  Because you're obviously, whatever there's...  You're pretty much at the forefront of the summits and all that stuff,  and, I mean, yours is the name that people mention when rappers are getting together  or there's problems and they're trying to fix it.  How do you feel about, you know... 
[03:05:00]  I mean, Remy and I just got, what, eight years in jail?  I mean, with all that stuff that's happening.  Well, you know, I don't...  I think it's, you know, just kids, you know, struggling or adults struggling.  I mean, just because they got a record deal, I mean, their world changed.  They come out of, for the most part, poverty,  and they reflect the kind of mindset from the place they come.  Although, I can say that they're great givers,  and I guess maybe that's part of those communities as well.  You know, Remy Ma got eight years.  That's just, you know, she shot her friend, you know what I mean? 
[03:05:30]  That was...  You get eight years for that.  I'm sorry for that.  She was actually a contributor to Hip Hop Summit.  She would show up and talk financial literacy with young people,  and just because you get a hit record or some money  doesn't mean the poverty mindset's gone, you know?  And that's what it is.  But I'm sorry she got eight years,  but I don't think that that's a reflection of hip hop.  No, no, no, I'm just saying because that's just the one that...  It's just all kind of shit going on all the time.  I mean, there's eyes who are really working  in the political and social, you know, landscape of this country.  I mean, if you name a rapper, I can tell your name is charity, you know? 
[03:06:00]  I mean, if you, you know, 50 Cent got G-Unity,  and Eminem got the Shady Foundation,  and Puffy got Daddy's House,  and Jay-Z got the Sean Carter Foundation,  and there's the Ludacris Foundation,  and Chingy for Change,  and Snoop Dogg got that football league.  He puts his own million dollars in every year,  and, you know, just name...  You know, I can't name a politician's charity.  Mm-hmm.  You know, they're pretty good givers.  You know, they show up when we need them.  How do you feel about what Cosby has been saying?  I mean, he's been very outspoken about, you know, 
[03:06:30]  well, you can't be a doctor saying this,  or you can't be a doctor...  I mean, he's okay with me.  I mean, I love him.  Did you say fuck him?  No, I meant he can do whatever.  You know what I mean?  Whatever.  I like him.  I got a lot of respect for him.  But, you know, I mean, I say that about everybody.  I say that, you know...  And I meant they're not about them, really.  They're opinion.  Everybody's got an opinion.  Do you disagree with him, I'm saying?  Well, I don't believe...  You know, I'm not that...  I can't...  I believe people are all doing the best they can,  and that our job is to keep showing them a better way.  If you believe that the world, you know, offers you more,  and if you believe it... 
[03:07:00]  Which is true.  If you believe that you can do better or feel better  by doing a little more work or getting up in the morning,  if you believe that, then you would do that.  If it makes you happy, you would do it.  But you don't have faith.  And so our job is to inspire faith,  not to judge so much, you know?  So I think we do a lot of judgment,  and say, I made it, why can't you?  So you had a little break, a little twist, a little something,  you know, and God showed you a little more, you know?  If somebody else can't see it,  they've got to, you know, be inspired, you know?  And each person needs that inspiration, 
[03:07:30]  and no one wants to suffer.  So you're saying also with the book  that anybody can be a success then,  depending on the mindset.  Yeah, I don't know what you mean,  but a success, again, is a state of happiness.  You're right.  I mean, technically you are correct,  but everybody knows that when you're living week to week,  it is a little bit harder.  Financial success does not make you happy,  but it does take off some of the pressure of being broke.  Being broke sucks.  Well, you know, because you want to express yourself.  You want to give.  I mean, the only thing you can do with money or toys is give.  You know, you can't hold on to none of them, 
[03:08:00]  and none of them mean nothing.  You know, when you're making a record,  you're laying in the studio,  and you're thinking,  oh, shit, wait till they hear this.  You know, when you're, you're not waiting,  oh, when this record comes out,  I'm going to be so rich.  You still go, you know,  it's really about your expression,  about what you give.  If you wake up in the morning  deciding on what you want to give,  you got a good day coming.  If you wake up, you know,  figuring out what you're going to get,  you're going to struggle that day.  So it's, everybody knows it.  That's what's in all the books, you know,  the, you know, Muhammad and Abraham  and Lord Buddha and Jesus all day. 
[03:08:30]  Wasn't lying to you.  They're telling you the truth.  But people have to figure out  how to remember these things,  and somebody has to rephrase them maybe sometime.  That's why they're different colors  and spoke different languages,  and then it came at different times.  They said, you know, the same shit, you know,  but they said it differently.  So, you know, I'm not, you know,  comparing myself to them.  I'm just saying, I'm just repeating it  so some young people maybe  and some other people living right now  can digest the truth, you know, the obvious.  That's hard to, that's hard to do, though,  because we do live in a world 
[03:09:00]  where people look at materialistic things.  It ain't that hard.  It's a practice, you know.  Really?  In yoga, what you do,  you smile and breathe in every pose, right?  Poses are tough.  They give you hard poses on purpose.  It's a practice.  Life is a practice.  When you get off the mat,  you got to move out, move around the city,  and, you know, you got to smile and breathe, you know,  and you got to be positive  and keep attracting good things  and keep giving good things.  I want to make that initial move, though,  to better yourself, let's say,  and to not be caught up in just having things 
[03:09:30]  for the sake of having them.  How do you get out of that cycle?  Well, it's pretty difficult.  Each day, it's a practice, you know.  You keep saying, it's just a practice, you know.  Every day, you try to get up.  Like, we talked about meditation.  You know, you get up, you sit still,  and you realize you don't need to, you know.  I mean, a lot of things I discovered, you know,  in meditation and prayer that I didn't need,  you know, the idea is let go of this shit, right?  I definitely don't need to eat animals  or chop them up, wham, you know,  if I can help it. 
[03:10:00]  Try to do, I definitely don't need  a lot of things that I thought I needed, you know,  and I learn more every day how little I need, you know.  Yeah.  I don't mean that I'm not consuming a lot of,  you know, too much stuff.  I'm just saying I consume less, you know,  and I give more.  Are you, you obviously,  I mean, for too many years, you know,  Russell's runs brother, Joseph Simmons.  Still am.  No, yeah, that's a good point.  I thought that ended up for a certain period.  The Reverend, yeah.  But, I mean, everybody knew him.  And then all of a sudden,  I don't know if it was when Def Jam Comedy started, 
[03:10:30]  but then you almost became the bigger name of the two.  Like, did you guys start off,  were you in the business even when he started,  or did you start Def Jam Records first?  Yeah, I started, no, I had Def Jam,  I had, no, I had Run,  I produced Run before there was Def Jam Records.  He was just always behind the scenes  and it became very visual.  No, me and Larry made Run.  Yeah.  King of Rock and all that.  Then Rick came along and we made the Raising Hell album.  By Larry.  Larry Smith, my man Larry Smith,  he produced with me the first Run DMC album.  The first two.  Speaking of Run, 
[03:11:00]  I watch Run's house every once in a while.  Yeah.  And I love how you deal with his kids.  You don't give them a break whatsoever.  His own nephews and nieces come to him  to learn the business.  I think they edit me a little tough.  Really?  You know, there's a little tough love on there,  but I think they make me a little tougher than I am.  You know, I got moments where I'm a little nicer than,  I seen this shit the other day,  and I was shitting all over Joe Joe.  I was, come on, I was not that tough.  But it really was me.  It was a scene that happened at a moment in time,  but it's not the only way I treat them. 
[03:11:30]  Basically, they go to him, you know,  assuming, oh, this is going to be the fast lane to success  and fame and fortune or whatever.  Oh, my God, that's true.  And next thing you know, the kid's an intern like anybody else  that would start in this organization.  And he's like, man, this stinks.  You've got to do that, though.  I mean, I think, you know, my kids,  their mother's a disciplinarian as well.  So, you know, I just try to make sure the kids  are doing what's right.  It's very interesting.  That's what I'm getting at.  You know, you're teaching them the right way, actually.  You're not, you're showing them that it's hard work.  I don't like that Sweet 16 shit on MTV. 
[03:12:00]  Oh, my God.  Now we can talk.  Sometimes those poor kids don't get what they want.  That's what the fuck is.  Russell, we're just trying to get a smile at you.  Help us out here.  That's funny.  Not everything has to be...  I watch it and say, oh, shit,  I can't believe they're getting this kid on this.  There is shows I watch just to get mad,  and Sweet 16 is certainly one of them.  It's like, you've got to be kidding me.  Yeah, rotten.  Getting brand new Lexus.  And getting mad because the car is the wrong color or something.  I couldn't imagine. 
[03:12:30]  You know what would have happened to me  if I'd grown up, if I'd, you know, acted like that?  The question, too, is about, like, you know,  back in the old days of Run-DMC  and, like, hip-hop back in those days.  It seemed like, lyrically, like, it's, I mean,  obviously it's gotten different or angrier,  or was it just more innocent back then?  Because, like, when you look at even, like,  the political stuff they talked about,  like Melly Mel or all those guys,  it's changed where there wasn't as much  talking about aggressively shooting.  I'm not saying hip-hop's responsible for any of that stuff.  Right, I don't know.  But why is that?  Well, you know, there was some tough rap, you know, 
[03:13:00]  back then, even before there were records,  there was, you know, gangs that were part of the rap,  you know, community, and kids coming out of struggle,  and so they were surrounded by gang members.  You know, even Run-DMC had the house crew around,  and they was some rough kids, whatever.  But, you know, the vocals are really an expression of,  like, as we know, where they come from.  And some, one moment there's more gangsters,  you know, selling records.  The next moment there's more conscious artists  selling records.  They're kind of trend, but, you know,  a hit-hit record by any mindset, 
[03:13:30]  whether it be Jesus Christ, I mean,  Jesus Walks or Fuck the Police, you know,  it just depends on the melody.  How strong is it?  And, you know, some mornings you roll over,  you say, fuck the police, you know,  why can't we have more dialogue?  What's it really saying?  Or some mornings you roll over and say,  Jesus Walks, depending on the artist, you know,  and it really depends on the melody.  You know, it's really the art,  the art itself is what's dictating, you know,  how great an expression is it,  not always what is it they're saying.  But back in those days, you had, like, rap battles. 
[03:14:00]  When Snoop Dogg is being made by Dr. Dre,  he's going to tell you what Snoop Dogg wants to tell you,  and you're going to buy it and listen to it.  I don't care if you're a Christian  and you'd rather hear Jesus Walks,  you'd think, but when you're here  rolling down the street, you're going to play it.  You're going to bang it in your car.  That's what it is.  So I think it's really about the art,  and I think, you know,  whether it's Slayer or it's a fucking Christian record,  it's a good record, you're going to play it.  You guys too, right?  Well, yeah.  I mean, you guys,  rap lyrics have gotten a lot of, you know, 
[03:14:30]  Slayer, you know that stuff.  I'm referring to this.  Oh, yeah.  Of course.  Well, you know, everybody listening probably don't know.  Yeah, but it's amazing how rap has gotten  a lot of content problems as far as like,  oh, they shouldn't say this, they shouldn't say that.  For heavy metal, let's say kind of words.  Oh, nigga, nigga, nigga, bitch, bitch, bitch,  ho, ho, ho, what the fuck, whatever.  And you want those words kind of banned from the clean versions?  No, I just thought mainstream radio,  mainstream radio, you know,  they could take it off.  That way you acknowledge the pain  of some suffering, you know, adults,  you know, and that's it.  That way you can leave us alone  instead of making legislation and stuff. 
[03:15:00]  Right.  And it's just an acknowledgement that this,  and you know, since you can't say shit, bitch,  fuck, I mean, fuck,  certain things you can't say on mainstream radio,  just agree as artists.  They will do, even if Fox News won't do it,  even if no one else wants to do it,  we're not going to say these three  and a few other, they beep them anyway.  Yeah.  They beep all those words all the time anyway,  only on hip hop radio.  You guys probably wouldn't have to beep them  because that's what they do.  So just give it to them.  You know, it's like, whatever,  what are you fighting for, right? 
[03:15:30]  Yeah, yeah.  That's what, we were fighting over nothing.  Did you feel Ima should have been fired?  Because I was kind of irritated.  I was kind of irritated about the way rappers had that.  I thought I wouldn't listen to him.  I had to listen to him anyway.  But I mean, like, Snoop came out and said,  oh, I think he should be fired,  which was irritating because all the content,  flack that rappers have gotten.  That's different.  I think it's a little different.  How so?  I think he's an artist expressing himself,  and there's a guy, you know, who's got a...  But he's an artist in a way.  It's like, he is an artist.  Well, I think it's a little different  between him and Snoop,  but I don't, you know,  I don't know whether he should have been fired or not. 
[03:16:00]  I didn't really even get in that debate.  But that's the thing about the art.  It's almost like musicians and actors...  It's good to have public discussion  of stuff like that, though.  Well, musicians and actors  have always gotten the art umbrella  to stand under,  and yet when it's comedy,  people don't put it under the umbrella of art.  It's seen as being rude or crass or real,  and it's like, why do musicians get that?  They say all those things all the time,  but I don't think it's the same.  I really, I mean, I don't have to get into it.  I mean, I do believe that, you know,  that some of these words I use all the time myself,  it doesn't make anything, 
[03:16:30]  but if I were to hear Imus say it,  you know, I'd probably be standing  in front of the station protesting.  Why?  Because he was saying something different.  It's intention more than it is...  It's intention.  Yes, it isn't.  More than it is language.  Everyone knows what his intention was.  Semantics is not...  Well, we're not going to argue about whether...  Well, if I said...  What did you intend?  It's hurtful.  I might not have been taking the time  to stand out there,  but I understand that people  don't want hateful expressions.  So do you think that was hateful expression?  Because he was basically...  Hold on, but the thing that made that funny...  I didn't even listen. 
[03:17:00]  It was like something that went over my head.  I didn't give a fuck.  Right.  It was not...  The dialogue about it was helpful.  I'm the chairman of the Foundation  for Ethnic Understanding.  I promote dialogue.  That's what I do.  I'm doing Muslim-Jewish dialogue now.  The chairman of...  Good luck with that, by the way.  The president of that organization  is Rabbi Snai,  who's the chairman  of the World Jewish Congress.  I promote religious and racial dialogue.  But how could you say it was hateful expression?  But I didn't care.  Well, there are people who get outraged,  and it's kind of a good reflection  or statement about our society. 
[03:17:30]  When they hear things  that they think promote division,  and when they come out,  I'm always...  I want to hear the debate.  I want to hear the discussion.  I want people to feel uncomfortable  about, you know,  pointing out differences  rather than being connected.  I want to promote the connection  between people.  It's what I do for a living.  But you're saying that  I miss a statement.  I'm only saying this,  because I know you didn't go out  and scream for his head,  but I'm saying that  there was this thing  that when Snoop came out,  it just seemed very like 
[03:18:00]  as much crap as hip-hop has gotten.  The first chance rappers got...  Snoop has done a lot  for race relations.  No, no, no, but the first chance...  All the rappers have done a lot  for race relations.  The first chance  that people got to have  somebody silenced  because they said something  they didn't like.  He was like,  yank him off the air.  When everyone knew I'm a...  He didn't say he couldn't say it.  He just said he didn't want him  on the air.  That was what I think Snoop said.  I don't know.  But why wouldn't hip-hop  as much crap as you guys have gotten  defend the guy's right  to say what he wants?  He wasn't coming off as hateful  because it really wasn't.  Oh, look, I didn't hear that.  I thought that he was.  I thought that he constantly...  He quoted Spike Lee.  That was his job. 
[03:18:30]  He was really going for a joke.  He was going for a joke.  Whether he found it funny or not.  I thought that that was his job,  that he's usually saying  something hateful  and finally they singled him out.  It used to be funny.  But hateful.  But that wasn't hateful  and you can't...  Well, I don't know.  Is Ice-T being hateful  when he sings Cop Killer  or is he just being an artist?  No, he was telling Cop Killer.  He's saying fuck the Polish  they abuse it to my community  and he can say it  and he lost his job too, didn't he?  He shouldn't have though.  Yeah, maybe not.  I don't think he should have lost it.  But I understood  it was not literal either, 
[03:19:00]  I don't think.  Well, Imus wasn't being hateful.  It's not about Imus anymore  because he's back to work  but it was just about the...  Good for him.  He's doing a lot of charity work too.  He always has.  They kicked him out  in the middle of a children's cancer drive.  Yeah, that was pretty bad.  I mean, and Sharpton  and those guys fought for him  to be thrown off.  I don't care about him  getting thrown off or not.  I'm glad he's back to work.  God bless him.  I hope that America learns  from the dialogue  that the world is shifting.  People didn't believe  that there would be Obama with him.  I'm looking at the news.  But Obama, they didn't think it. 
[03:19:30]  Most older Americans  didn't believe it was possible  that he would win the nomination.  They didn't think it was possible.  African Americans either.  They just didn't think.  You know, and they're seeing  young people transcend race  in a way that they didn't expect.  They didn't think America  was at that point.  And so you see growth and change.  And it's good.  It's very positive.  It should be inspiring.  That's for sure.  It should be.  That's right.  They should make people realize  that, you know,  they want to sign on.  Not necessarily for him  but just for the idea  that, you know, 
[03:20:00]  we're not so different.  Does it bother you  that people credit  Debbie Harry with starting hip-hop  in Rats Are My Blondie?  People say that  doesn't bother me at all.  She actually was my inspiration.  I got another smile at him.  That's good.  Well, yeah.  Do you think I don't smile?  I don't smile all the time.  Russell, you're a bit intense.  Am I?  A little bit.  Throw his book at your head.  Yeah, you're smiling  on the cover of your book.  That's good.  I smile all the time.  I can't believe you. 
[03:20:30]  Motherfucker.  Motherfucker.  What are you trying to say to me?  What do you think  is the most realistic  hip-hop movie made?  Because there's so many  of them made.  Oh, I don't know.  I mean, there's a lot of,  you know,  none of the ones  I was part of.  You know, Crush Groove  or what was the other one?  Tough and Leather?  I really don't think.  How about Breaking 2?  Electric Booga Hoop.  I didn't think much of that.  Breaking 1 either.  Yeah.  What else?  Jimmy was deep into hip-hop  for a while.  I like that Tupac movie.  What was that?  No, I like belly too. 
[03:21:00]  It was kind of just  the way it was shot.  It was so weird.  The one he did  was not Mickey Rourke?  I'm sorry.  He did a movie  with Mickey Rourke, I think.  No, no, not that one.  I made a movie  with Tupac too.  I produced Gridlocked.  No, but there was  a movie with a...  Come on, man.  Stop playing.  My brain is...  I'm older.  I took drugs as a child.  I'm a vegan now,  but I really  fucked my brain up.  What is it?  The Tupac movie, man.  You know, the big...  I don't know.  I was never into  the West Coast stuff.  I don't really know  very little about it.  It wasn't a West Coast movie.  It was a Brooklyn movie.  No, but I mean  about the rappers.  I don't know 
[03:21:30]  very little about any of them.  Poetic Justice or Juice?  Juice.  Juice?  Juice.  First starring role?  Yeah.  I had to look it up.  Oh, you looked it up?  That's pretty good.  Yeah, you know.  The internet's good  for some things.  Did you look at Global Grind?  Yes.  Who do you think  was the greatest rapper ever?  Oh, fuck.  Leaving your brother out of it.  One man is Chuck D.  One man is Chuck D to me.  Jay-Z is great.  You know, Nas is great.  He got a record.  I'm a nigga, you a nigga.  Have you heard it?  We're not allowed  to say that word, so... 
[03:22:00]  He wore the shirt.  He wore the shirt.  Wouldn't you like to be a nigga?  We're just not allowed  to say that one.  What are you trying  to do to us?  You can't say that?  Oh, you can play the record?  Yeah, we can.  Play the record.  Not on CBS we can't.  We have regular radio  for three hours.  We couldn't play it over there.  Yeah, it doesn't matter  the context or anything.  Oh.  Just can't say it.  It's amazing.  Yeah.  You were listed by  one of the top 25  most influential people  in the last 25 years  by USA Today.  I don't know when  the fuck they got that,  but it's...  It's still gotta feel good, though. 
[03:22:30]  Yeah, and I was right  over Bin Laden  and under Hillary Clinton.  No, vice versa.  Wait, you were under...  Under Bin Laden.  Over Bin Laden,  like, you know, like, more.  I was 20-something, right?  And Bin Laden was, you know,  on top of me  was Hillary Clinton  and Bill together.  So you're more for Obama  or McCain?  I'm kidding.  Well, I don't...  I mean, you know,  McCain, I'm just scared  the shit out of him.  At three in the morning,  he'll blow the shit out.  At three in the morning,  he will fuck around  and blow everything out.  I think that.  Don't you?  Are you afraid? 
[03:23:00]  Nah, not...  You know something?  I don't like McCain.  I remember when they said  that about Reagan, too.  They were like,  oh, the second Reagan  gets into office,  we're gonna be in a war.  We'll be in a war.  If we don't watch it,  we'll be in a war  before there's an election  because I think that's  a good enough strategy.  I just want to know  if John McCain  ever talked out  his issues with anybody.  We don't know that much.  I'll sat down  with a therapist  and...  That would make me feel...  Oh, angry, you mean?  Yeah.  Well, he's had a tough...  Yeah, he had a tough for a while.  I want to make sure  he worked that stuff out  with a therapist somewhere.  You don't get that  between the ages of 70 and 75. 
[03:23:30]  You don't shift, you know,  that much.  If he did it in 70,  he's likely to do it in 72.  Well, there's a lot  of interest with politics.  I mean,  we haven't seen  an interest like this  and maybe  not in our lifetimes,  I don't think, right?  Yeah, well, you know.  You quit drugs?  A lot of new things happen.  Oh, yeah.  I've been straight to 20 years.  All right, so...  Yeah, I did the same thing.  Did you quit, like,  actively saying,  I'm going to stop  or did it just kind of,  like, did you go out of it  or did you actually say  I better quit?  I just stopped.  I stopped.  18, too?  All the...  Yeah.  Oh, cool.  Yeah, but Jimmy stopped at 17.  18. 
[03:24:00]  18 was old.  Yeah, I was one of those.  Yeah.  He just knew early on  this wasn't for him.  I always try to tell him,  you know, what,  you were an asshole drunk at 18?  Who wasn't?  That was awful.  Maybe it's just called  being 18 and being drunk.  No, I used to call the FBI.  I mean, it was a problem.  You know, it had to be stopped.  There was something bad happening.  Call the FBI.  Hey, is this your first book  or is this your first book?  It's my second book.  My first book was called  Life and Death,  D-E-F, Sex, Drugs, Money, and God.  Nice.  So that was the first book. 
[03:24:30]  But this book was really a surprise.  I mean, Oprah liked it.  She named it,  as a matter of fact,  when she read it.  Oh, she told me she liked it.  That's a good one.  No, she had me on for an hour  and promoted the shit out of it.  I mean, it's part of the reason  it's a bestseller.  But she named it.  When she read the book,  she called me up  and she said  she didn't like the title.  It was something about  Laws of Success  and then she's like,  the second title,  I don't know what chapter  is called Do You?  And she said  that's the name of the book  because the book refers  to that self,  you know, a lot, 
[03:25:00]  which I talked about earlier.  And so she named it  and it was a great name.  She said my shit was corny,  which is amazing to me  to have Oprah tell me  that my something was corny.  But that's how powerful Oprah is.  She can call you  and go,  I don't like the title.  Well, I'll change it.  I don't blame you.  I would too.  It rang a bell  when she said it instantly.  Did she really say  it was corny?  Yeah, she said  that was not a good title.  Wow.  Particularly for my audience.  You know,  and that was the same week  she was bashing rap.  Yeah, yeah.  Funny, but she was not wrong,  you know, 
[03:25:30]  and I mean,  she's a great supporter  of the book of me, so.  Yeah, then Alicia Keys  got a little bit of shit,  right, coming out.  I think she maybe  might have been misquoted  or something.  Oh, yeah, government.  Yeah, I think she said  they created the climate for  and she restated it.  I don't know.  Yeah, and then 50 Cent  bashed her about  her classical music.  I kind of like that.  And then she kind of  took it back  and he's like,  all right, well, fuck it.  All right.  He said her music sucks.  I guess I got to eat that.  Yeah, we're all friends now.  All right.  Well, the book is called  Do You.  It's obviously,  it was a bestseller.  Is there anything  different in the paperback  or is it just a little bit  smaller and a little bit lighter?  It's a little small, 
[03:26:00]  a little light,  a little cheaper.  Deepak Chopra,  he wrote his endorsement last  and so it didn't make  the hardcover,  so it's on here now.  Jesus.  But, you know,  it's a pretty,  it was a fun exercise  writing it.  People who say  it's changed their life  inspire me  as why I'm still  talking about it,  you know,  even though it's  just a softcover.  It's in the airports  and everywhere,  you know,  it's in the front of stores  and people can go  pick it up  It's inspiration,  I hope,  you know,  for anybody who reads it  and certainly for some  it has been a great inspiration  so it's what I do, 
[03:26:30]  you know.  Thanks for having me  talk about it.  Is there anything  you want to do  that you haven't done?  I mean,  you're an interesting guy.  I mean,  you've kind of hit  all facets of entertainment.  Is there something  that you want to do?  I run five charities.  I'm the chairman,  like I said,  the Foundation for  I Think and Understanding,  the Hip Hop Summit,  the Diamond Empowerment Fund,  the Rush Foundation.  All of those things  are okay,  but, you know,  for instance,  the Art Foundation,  underwriting art education  programs in New York,  there's about 80  that we underwrite,  right?  But a shift in policy  will make all the schools 
[03:27:00]  have art education  or, you know,  the Diamond Empowerment Fund.  If I could change  the diamond industry  and then, you know,  I wouldn't be worried  about funding  this one college  that we have.  You know,  we have a college  that raised  eight million dollars  in gifts  and in cash  for that school  over the last year.  These things are good,  but the real difference  is when you get  the right people  in office  and they see things  and they make  the big change.  We fought so hard,  the whole Hip Hop Summit  went to work  and we got the drug laws 
[03:27:30]  changed.  But now Elliot,  Fitz is gone  and he promised  he was going to  really fix it.  I don't know what's wrong.  Well, I guess he's married,  he shouldn't be behind  but I guess.  You want to run after him,  that should be their campaign.  I mean, I don't know.  Of course you're right,  he shouldn't be,  but he shouldn't be  getting caught.  And Patterson,  I love Patterson  because he had some stuff,  he probably never  thought he'd be governor.  Yeah, but Patterson,  you know,  I think that maybe  he'll change the laws  so that people,  the judge can have  jurisdiction  and people won't  go to jail for 20 years  for a little bit of drugs. 
[03:28:00]  You know,  it's really a sad truth  all over the country still.  So the difference  between the fight  that we can wage  in the street  and what the politicians  can do from the office  is dramatic.  So we want to get  the right people  in office.  So, you know,  I try to be an advocate  for politicians  who make change  and help people  come out of poverty  and promote dialogue  around the world  and fix the environment.  I mean,  I say all this stuff  because I endorse Obama.  I think he's probably  the one who can make  some of those  kind of commitments. 
[03:28:30]  That's it.  That's what it is.  That's, you know,  I'm not angry or nothing.  I don't know why you think  I don't smile.  You're looking at me.  I've been smiling  all the time,  but I want to say it  for those who are going to  I'm not upset.  Look at Opie.  He thinks every black guy  is angry.  No.  Look how white Opie is.  Opie's so white.  At least I'm part Sicilian.  He don't look that white to me.  I'm a mutt.  He's so white.  I'm a mutt.  I'm a little of everything.  But you're very white.  All right.  Whatever happened  to Big Daddy Kane? 
[03:29:00]  You're the man.  Oh, that's my man.  I saw him down in  one of those southern towns  I was on the road  promoting my  clothing company.  He was there.  Is he still working?  Is he still putting out  albums or no?  No, I think he performs though.  Okay.  It's funny.  I was just listening to  Curtis Blow on the radio.  Is he on Sirius?  Or on XM or something?  I don't know.  Curtis, I mean,  all of the artists  are working it seems like.  Unless they found a new job,  they still got something to do.  And Curtis Blow  was my first artist  in 1979.  Christmas rapping. 
[03:29:30]  Yeah.  Yeah, and still plays.  Who is the first guy?  We actually, unfortunately,  had a band interview with him.  But he's, I think,  the guy that they credited  with kind of starting it.  What was his name,  the rapper?  I mean, he's for so many years  back, very dirty.  Oh, real old school.  Like a real old guy.  Blowfly, I think.  Blowfly, yeah.  I mean, is he considered  like one of the pioneers?  I don't really think much of him.  I don't think bad of him.  I just don't think about him.  This goes back to the late 50s,  I think.  I don't know that much about him.  And some people say  he started it all, yeah.  Whatever.  Russell obviously thinks  he's an ass.  What about saying that?  No, I don't think he's an ass. 
[03:30:00]  I really don't think of him  as like, you know,  like when I think of  the originating of hip-hop  in its current form,  I think about Hollywood  and Eddie Chieva  and Grandmaster Flash  and these guys,  even Curtis Blow.  They were some of the first artists  who really did rap  the way we buy it  and sell it now, you know.  So it's different  from a poet on the radio, you know.  Lots of poets on the radio.  You want to smack Ice Cube  in the head  for some of the movies  he's making these days?  No.  I think that my kids  like his movies.  Yeah, the kids love his movies.  I don't think anybody  has to stick to anything, 
[03:30:30]  you know.  That's the thing.  That's what this book's about.  You're sold out, man.  That's what my life's about.  Do you change  whatever you want to change?  Look, I'm all for harmony,  but can we say this?  The Black Honeymooners  shouldn't have happened.  That was hurtful to our people.  That was funny.  I mean, that's the movie,  what you said.  That's good.  They redid Caddyshack, too.  Yeah.  I mean, there's a lot of...  They did a Black Caddyshack?  Yes.  It was called  Who's Your Caddy?  I didn't see...  Who's Your Caddy?  I did see a trailer 
[03:31:00]  for The Honeymooners  and I like Cedric  because, you know,  he's one of the people  who starred in Deaf Comedy Jam  and he's a wonderful guy.  And his man  was a host for a little while  on Deaf Comedy Jam.  It's not even...  Not Joe Torre,  not Martin Lawrence.  There's my brain again.  Oh, boy.  Oh, my God.  Not D.L. Hughley  who was doing it recently.  No, the most right before him.  Rich Voss.  Oh, yeah.  Can we talk about stupid...  Do you know Rich Voss?  Who is that?  Thank you.  Good.  There is a guy.  You just made our day.  I just made our day.  Rich Voss.  We're going to end  with a light note here. 
[03:31:30]  He was the first white comic  on Deaf Jam.  Really?  I want to hug him.  Ah, this is great.  I've never been happier.  Rich has done nothing  but pound this down  our throats forever  is a friend of the show.  Steve Harvey was guest hosting.  Yeah.  Really?  And he was the first...  I don't know if he was first.  No, he was.  He was the first white comic.  He says...  He's been saying...  Was he?  He got introduced as that.  Steve Harvey introduced him as that.  And afterwards,  it was very funny.  After Voss was finished,  he goes,  all right, now we're even.  Like, you know,  Voss.  It's happened.  But yeah,  there's a picture of him, 
[03:32:00]  Russell.  I've never seen him before.  Oh, that's fantastic.  I've lost you zero.  You're nothing, Rich.  When Russell doesn't remember you  as the first white guy  in a show,  I couldn't be happier.  I've got a bad memory.  Maybe that was...  No, you have a great memory.  He's not memorable.  You have a perfect memory.  Oh, I'm so happy.  Look, he's on Google.  Everyone's on Google.  Google horse shit.  I guarantee you...  Rich Voss comes up.  Well, Russell, thank you.  I mean, the book is obvious.  It's called to you.  It was a bestseller.  And, you know,  everything you touched  just seems to really work, man. 
[03:32:30]  Read this part, too.  12 Laws to Access the Power in You  to Achieve Happiness and Success  with the foreword by Donald Trump.  Yeah, and it's obviously  coming from a source  of somebody who's successful  because nobody wants  to hear a broke guy  write about how to succeed.  Yeah, but that would be  a different angle.  I would read a book like that.  That would be a great book title.  All the shit I've never done.  All the stuff I could have done  but just didn't feel like it.  It was busy.  You guys got to let me back  on this show.  I like the show.  Thank you, man.  I'm cool, man.  Thank you.  It's a real pleasure.  Thank you. 
[03:33:00]  Russell Simmons, everyone.  We're going to take a quick break.  Opie and Anthony.  Oxygen?  Lethal?  Find out how.  Coming up on the  Opie and Anthony show.  That piece of crap show.  It amazes me every day  we pull this off.  It's a madhouse.  They call me the seeker.  I've been searching low and high.  I won't get to hear what I'm after. 
[03:33:30]  I won't get to hear what I'm after.  You think so?  No, I'm joking.  I like him.  It was very interesting.  Can I tell you what a dummy I am?  Because as Russell's leaving,  I'm asking him to sign my book.  And I shook his hand.  Love this.  And I go, all right, man.  Good luck.  I was thinking good luck with the book.  But then I'm like, what an asshole.  He's worth probably 50 million.  Yeah.  And I'm wishing him luck.  Hey, good luck.  One day, kid, you can be like me.  I know.  Oprah renamed his book  and it's a bestseller.  But I'm giving him a pat.  Like, eh, nice try.  I really am an idiot.  How great is it  that he didn't remember Voss? 
[03:34:00]  Yeah.  He knew nothing of Rich Voss.  Even after we told him  who Voss was  and showed a picture.  Huge picture of him.  Why are we waiting?  We should have Voss on the phone now.  Just pound him.  Wow.  I gotta say.  Joe Nicolini's hot.  I'm talking about Sam.  Oh, my God.  Look at Sam's afro picked out.  This is it.  It's so fluffy.  It looks like brownish cotton candy.  Because of you,  Russell was very happy  that we're all about diversity  on the Opie and Anthony show  because he saw you behind the camera 
[03:34:30]  with that spiked out afro.  I'm glad I could help.  Now, that's big.  You are very helpful, Sam.  No.  That is awful.  That is God awful.  Pat it a little bit.  Let me see.  A little?  Can I catch it?  Yeah.  Pat it.  Yeah.  Hi there.  That is amazing.  Boom, boom.  Robert's really parts me.  Wow.  Get that picture.  Could you do one of those  awful, like, parts?  Yeah.  An awful part?  You know what?  You know what I mean?  Yeah, on the hair  that can't be parted. 
[03:35:00]  It's not supposed to be.  I want him to shave his head  like Gene Shallot  where he has, like,  a big fucking poofy part  in the back.  Oh, that's fantastic.  You know?  Do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do.  I think it looks all right.  It's awful.  What?  You look like a boob.  Yeah.  Absolutely.  All right.  Oh, great.  So, Lance going out  with Jill Nicolini.  That's the payoff.  You want to do the,  we got one more story  and then we're going to  do the line of the day.  I'll just fill my cabs.  I did think about it, though.  What? 
[03:35:30]  I was thinking,  hmm, do I?  Do I see him?  I know.  I know they're bowling pins.  I already know that, Jimmy.  I think that's right there.  We know that about each other.  Oh, here's Voss.  Hey, Rich.  Hey, what's up?  We got really good news for you.  You got good news for me?  Yes.  For once,  we got something  that you're going to appreciate.  Jimmy, take it away.  We just did a nice long interview  with Russell Simmons.  Yes.  You guys met, right?  I don't know if we,  oh, I did the show.  I don't think he would remember me. 
[03:36:00]  Wow.  Talk about perceptive.  Not only did he not remember  that you were the first  white comedian  on Def Comedy Jam  or Def Jam, whatever,  we showed him a picture  just to make sure  that he might have forgotten you  and he goes,  I've never met that man  in my life.  And he goes,  well, he might not have been  the first one.  And I'm like,  no, he really was.  We had to convince him  that you were the first  white guy on Def Jam.  And he goes,  no, he might not have been  the first one.  I was like,  no, no, he was.  We had to sit there  and pimp for you.  Really?  And we're just extremely happy 
[03:36:30]  that he didn't remember you  whatsoever.  I couldn't have been happier.  This is going to be  the greatest news  I've ever heard.  Well, for us,  it was great.  He doesn't even remember me.  Yeah, for us,  it was probably  better than the first time  we came.  Ten years ago.  And so,  what's the good news?  What year did you do that,  actually?  He's still thinking  we got good news for him,  you dope.  That's the news.  Rich, what year did you do it?  I don't know.  It was like ten years ago.  Okay.  Was it like the 98?  Wow.  I was in the audience. 
[03:37:00]  Me and Eric McMahon  went to see you.  Yeah.  Yeah, it was like ten years ago.  But I got good news  for you guys.  I'm in Florida.  I'm getting ready  to go play a nice golf course  right now.  So that should be good news  for everybody, right?  What gig are you doing?  Yeah, what gig  and which golf course  are you playing in Florida?  Um,  it's...  Oh.  Oh.  That's got to hurt.  I'm sure it's a public course.  We don't allow Jews  at Bushwood.  He was intense though,  you know.  Russell?  Yeah. 
[03:37:30]  He's right.  I was surprised that he was.  And then he wasn't happy  that we called him out  on being intense.  We?  Yeah.  You kept saying he wasn't happy.  You were amazed  that he laughed.  Well, he was intense  and, you know,  it was nice to see him  smile a couple times.  We broke him a little bit.  Well, he's a big yoga guy.  He actually is a lot...  He seems a lot stronger  in person.  Like, when you shake his hand...  Because yoga really makes you...  It works your muscles and shit.  He's a stronger guy  than I would have thought he was.  You can just tell  by someone's handshake.  Works the faggot muscle.  By the way,  who said that Russell Simmons  was worth 50 million? 
[03:38:00]  I was guessing.  I was joking.  Uh, try 300.  Perhaps more than that, Jim.  Wow.  Try 300 million.  300 million.  Oh, I thought you meant  300 bucks.  That came in a couple times.  Wow, okay.  There must be some kind  of money list out there  that someone looked up.  300 million dollars.  Wow.  How about some fucking  Fat Farm gear for the boys, huh?  How about a Fat Farm sweatshirt?  Yeah.  I would like that.  A little freebie.  Yeah.  Wow.  He could buy the N-word  with that money.  Ooh.  All right.  I already own it.  Thank you, sir.  Thank you.  You ain't taking it away from me.  Can I have a lease on it, at least? 
[03:38:30]  We got a great...  Yeah, pay residuals.  We got a great Paul McCartney story  before we do Line of the Day.  Oh, what happened with Sir Paul?  Well, you know.  Where's me mates?  They're dead.  That's right.  Listen to this.  Old Puddin' Head.  What happened, George?  He doesn't recognize me.  John's got oatmeal in his hair.  Oh, God.  Get it? 
[03:39:00]  He got a shot at shit.  I'm just kidding, y'all.  Oh, shit.  No, you didn't.  No, I didn't.  Now we go into our black accents.  I'm just kidding.  I would've done it in front of Russell  and, you know, he wouldn't care.  He could've, like, judged.  He doesn't seem easily offended.  He's been around comedy  and fucking rap his whole life.  He's like, fuck it.  Fuck it.  You know, I believe that, too.  I think a lot of people  that aren't fans of Imus  really believe that he was  trying to do that with Hayden.  But it was interesting to hear that.  He's like, oh, I didn't know that.  Like, wow. 
[03:39:30]  The knee-jerk reaction was  people just saw that.  And no one cared, you know,  what was the context  of Imus' words that day.  I believe he believes  and other people believe  that Imus really was trying  to be very hateful.  Hateful towards both people.  But he was really, truly  going for the joke.  No.  Whether it was funny or not  is up to you.  It was hilarious.  But he was definitely trying to,  oh, my God, what's going on?  I wasn't saying with hate.  Of course not.  Oh, my God.  But I hope people appreciated  my umbrella argument  of fucking where our belongs. 
[03:40:00]  That was very good.  Somebody ought to fucking,  somebody ought to swimwalk  for himself in the mirror later.  I hated it.  But Opie, I like umbrella arguments.  All right, Paul McCartney.  What happened to Paul?  Hey, listen to the story.  All right, Paul McCartney  is in a fuel fury.  The former Beetle  is under fire  for having a Japanese hybrid car  flown to him in Britain  rather than having it sent by ship.  He was given the $158,000 Lexus  as a gift from the company.  Lexus sponsored his 2005 U.S. tour. 
[03:40:30]  But environmentalists say  delivering the car  that completely offset,  delivering the car  the way they're sending it  completely offsets  their environmental gains.  Does that make sense?  Yes.  I do know what I'm talking about.  It just came out wrong.  He had a car flown to him.  He fucked a one-legged lady.  I think that's more interesting.  For an environmentalist,  it's a little strange.  He probably didn't know it.  They probably just sent it to him.  Yeah.  And they probably were like,  hey, we're going to get your car.  And he's like, all right.  And they just flew it there 
[03:41:00]  and he's like, oh.  Okay.  Fly it over.  I don't think he was one,  that car was on  one of those aircrafts  with other things either.  It was probably just a private jet  getting his five brakes.  Probably his big cargo plane  just burning fucking  50,000 gallons a second.  It doesn't burn that much, does it?  No.  I just like doing  my bad Paul impression.  I think it's funny.  I can't do it.  Puddin' head.  Puddin'.  Puddin'.  You can always hear him  what he does 
[03:41:30]  when he plays hopscotch  because the inside of his head  sounds like a squishy,  squishy, squishy.  I couldn't think of the words  so I made the sound.  That's okay.  I don't do the accent good either.  No, it's perfect.  Hey.  This guy, uh...  Hey, do you have Tourette's?  Me?  No, it's fine.  What do you got?  Come in.  Me?  Yeah.  No, not you, sir.

No, over here would be better.  Oh, okay.  Oh, no, over there.  Keep the mic.  Yeah, over here.  He's a good boy.  Yeah, over this way.  All right.  How you doing, buddy?  Okay.  Over here.

It looks like you carry around the pictures wherever you go, and you don't really-  Oh, Steven Seagal?  Oh, John Waters?  Uh-huh.  Uh, two guys from Kiss?  You got Paul and Gene from Kiss?

Charlie, a very good collection. 
[03:51:00]  I actually have to say that Dustin Hoffman is the most impressive.  Thank you.  All right.  What are you doing?  Oh.  What happened?  You want to sit?  You want to sit?  No, no, you don't want me to see.  Okay.  I would love to see the pictures, Charlie.  No, you wouldn't.  Charlie, have you ever listened to this show before?  Wait a minute.  No, no.  What?  As long as you don't throw him...  No, I'm kidding.  Oh, God.  You can't do that.  You can't.  That's okay.  What if I give you my word?  I won't throw him.  No, no, no.  Yeah, you can't.  It's okay.  Oh, no, you can't do that.  You can't do it.  No. 
[03:51:30]  I want to see the picture you took with me.  I'm going to leave.  What?  You can't do it.  Charlie?  You can't do it.  Can I see your picture?  No.  Don't do it, Charlie.  If you don't throw him.  Charlie, have you ever listened to this show before?  I do.  There's no if you don't throw him.  Exactly.  And he won't throw him.  He'll probably just sit there and rip them.  That's what Paul had said to Hitler.  You're just cutting through, right?  See, Charlie really wants me to see his book.  Look, he's getting close.  He wants you to because he's a nice guy.  I know the show, so I don't know.  Oh, you can't do it.  They're not really sure, huh?  No, no, I wouldn't. 
[03:52:00]  What do you think, Charlie?  Can I?  Yeah, I wouldn't.  No, I wouldn't either, Charlie.  But you can.  I mean, we've warned you for now.  If you want to.  Yeah, you've been warned.  Please.  Just don't.  We're saying don't.  Charlie, you're an idiot.  Okay.  It's okay.  He got really close.  Charlie, what happened?  He got a little nervous.  Charlie.  Now I'm really getting nervous.  Yeah.  Yeah.  It was my night, Charlie.  You ever been to FH Riley's? 
[03:52:30]  Yes.  The Heart of Huntington Village?  Yeah.  I was there for the, uh, um, uh, yeah.  Yeah, that.  I went there, too, for that one.  Karaoke.  It was nice, right?  Charlie's a little nervous today.  You nervous?  I was.  Big time.  You seem a little nervous.  You don't have to be.  We're all nice guys, Charlie.  There's something there with Charlie.  We've got to figure this out.  15th President of the United States.  Quickly.  Who was it?  Yeah, do you have any, like, hidden talents that we need to know?  Nothing at all.  About?  What?  Huh?  No, I know.  There's got to be something about you, like, that would impress people. 
[03:53:00]  Big cock.  Uh, nothing.  He's able to hold up, uh, radio hosts leaving.  Oh, well, yeah.  That's a good trick.  But this is radio hosts.  Here's your hat.  What's your hurry?  How many, uh, it's been real, it's been nice, but it hasn't been real nice.  How many Michael J. Fox contests have you won over the years?  What happened?  What?  No.  What?  What?  Jimmy.  Completely inappropriate, I'd say. 
[03:53:30]  Oh, Charlie.  Well, how many?  Charlie.  Goddammit, the boss has you.  Charlie.  Charlie.  Charlie's got, like, this nervous, Charlie's moving a lot, because he has this fucking nervous  energy.  He's just got to fucking, he's hyped up.  Did you have some of that five hour?  Um, I, yep, that's what it was.  That's what it was?  Wow.  I recommend it.  You have to fucking run from here to Beijing.  By the end of the day, you might as well, yeah, start with some five hours.  Cheaper than crystal meth. 
[03:54:00]  All right, Charlie, it was a pleasure meeting you, even though I guess we met before, because  you got pictures of all of us.  Yep.  Okay.  All right.  Where are you going, Charlie?  All right.  Thank you.  Charlie.  Charlie.  Charlie almost fell over.  Charlie.  How are we not filming Charlie?  Charlie rules.  Charlie, where are you going?  We need more Charlie in our lives.  You don't know where you're going, do you?  Charlie's confused.  Yes.  Do you want to do line of the day?  Okay.  Well, you want to read the copy at least for us?

[03:56:00]  Here is the first runner-up line of the day.  Line of the day.  Yep.  There must be something wrong.  It's not playing.  Hang on.  Move your afro, Sam.  Sam's afro is in the way.  Sam's afro is in the way.  The entire...  I try to even go around it.  There's nothing.  It blocked the whole thing up.  It's like a big drain clog. 
[03:56:30]  What happened, Danny?  Did Charlie make the machine nervous?  What's going on?  Why isn't it playing?  I don't know.  I'm just going to skip ahead to the next one.  This one doesn't want to play.  All right, Charlie.  Here's another runner-up line of the day.  Here's another runner-up of the day.  Nothing.  Nothing?  I don't know.  Something's wrong.  Let me try this again.  Hang on.  Let me do it a different way.  You really taxed the compression on video over the web.  I'll tell you that much.  A lot of pixelation with you.  A lot. 
[03:57:00]  Yeah.  Charlie, what's your deal?  What do you like to do for fun?  We want to get to know you.  Listen to you.  Sit still.  Are you a good citizen, of course?  Yes.  Why are you looking around?  You're a little nervous?  Yeah.  Why are you nervous?  First time here, so...  Oh.  We're nice guys.  I used to do the walkover.  But, uh...  Until, you know, you knew what...  I mean, you know, I'm doing the walkover in the mall. 
[03:57:30]  Yeah.  Hello.  We got lazy, Charlie.  Who are you talking to?  Who's that?  No, I'm...  I'm...  Who the fuck is that?  I'm doing the show.  Who the fuck's on the phone?  I'll call you later.  Who the fuck is that?  That was my pool guy.  Fuck him!  Cuban with a big cock.  Just say it.  All right.  Back to that pool guy.  I have a higher hope for that one.  Charlie, uh...  Are we going to try this again, Danny?  Uh...  Well, I'm just looking.  I just opened up some of the waveforms that were cut, 
[03:58:00]  and apparently there was...  There was an error while saving them down.  I'm going to see which, if any of them are.  Who do we get to blame?  Hey, man, let's get out of the problem and into the solution.  What do we do from here?  Who do we get to blame today?  Sam?  Sam?  Where is that curly-haired shit dick?  Right here.  Oh, hi.  Can we light your hair on fire?  No.  I bet that would go up like, uh...  Like Tinder.  Like Kindle-ing.  Let me at least throw matches at it.  I mean, the odds of me hitting you in the head with a lit match.  Come on.  Sam, what happened?  Oh, with...  It must have been a dilett thing. 
[03:58:30]  Travis and me just listened to these 20 minutes ago,  so there's obviously an error in the system.  So you're not going to blame yourself?  Not this time.  Otherwise, I would love to.  Travis?  Trav?  Yeah, I'll back up Sam.  We listened to him before we threw him in there.  So I don't know what happened.  Sam?  Yeah, I'm going to back up Travis on that.  We did listen to them.  Travis?  I got to agree with Sam on this one.  All right.  Sam?  Travis has got the right...  He's right.  Sam?  Good idea on Travis's part.  Charlie? 
[03:59:00]  Honey?  Pardon?  Pardon?  I do have the winner line of the day.  I say we say goodbye to Big A, and we say hello, Charlie!  I'm not bolting them together.  We just need a nickname for Charlie.  That's all that is in your way, my friend.  Goodbye, Big A.  Goodbye.  What do we got, line of the day?  Do you want to come in and hang with us again, Charlie?  Sure.  Mm-hmm?  Sure.  You're a little nutty, but we like you.  Do you sing? 
[03:59:30]  No.  No, I don't.  I would love to hear you sing, I'm thinking.  Well, you went to karaoke.  I'm thinking maybe you did a song or something.  No, I just hung out.  No?  That's all.  Do you tell jokes?  No.  Yeah.  Drink.  That's it.  Drink.  Drink?  Drink.  That's all.  Cool.  Yeah.  You're an alcoholic?  No.  I used to be glad in the hall.  Do you...  A couple of shats?  Do you touch kids?  No.  You have to pause for a second.  Well, pick them up and look at them. 
[04:00:00]  They're just so cute.  They're that small.  All right.  Cardscan.com slash Radio 1.  Here is your line of the day.  Here comes the line of the day.  Line of the day.  Line of the day.  Line of the day.  What do you mean by way out of his league?  Oh, I just got to hold on somebody.  I'm trying to, you know, stick up for you.  Like, if Jill Nicolini's in the major leagues, where would Anthony be? 
[04:00:30]  Anthony right now will be coaching T-ball and have questionable photographs on his computer.  You got to love that one.  People want Charlie to do the time between us and Rana Fez.  Someone's suggesting he just sits here and reads the newspaper between now and noon.  Well, that'll make my commute home.  I'm a...  Sorry, Jimmy.  Taking your bit.  It's not my bit.  It's your bit.  Shut up.  Everybody snores, Anthony. 
[04:01:00]  I didn't make up snoring.  See, here's why you got to love Keith, the cop.  Took care of the pool guy.  Don't worry about it.  Oh, you don't have to suck him off today.  The guy's on vacation.  That means Keith right now is wiping his wrist off.  Yeah.  I'm fucking good.  What do you think about Charlie there, Jimmy?  Something's there.  Charlie's just got a nervous energy about him.  Nervous energy, right?  I think Charlie would be a fine recurring guest on this radio program. 
[04:01:30]  Mm-hmm.  I think you have an interesting voice.  I think you're a little nervous.  Right.  I think you panic when you're nervous.  Panic.  So I think you'd be fun to have around.  Yeah.  And why not?  I mean, him and Big A could be fucking wonderful.  Would you like to hang out with Big A?  Sure.  No, you don't.  We need more interesting characters on this show.  Yeah.  Charlie's a new character.  No.  And he could be a very interesting guy.  What is his character, though? 
[04:02:00]  How about just shaky Charlie?  Shaky Charlie.  Now he's crossing his arms.  You're making him all nervous.  Who cares?  You got a nervous energy.  You make him all nervous.  Don't make him nervous.  He has that high energy that just comes out like, you know?  Like, you'd think, is this guy, is he being tasered?  And no.  Let's just call him Aftershock.  Oh, God.  How about Charlie Jiggles?  Charlie Jiggles?  People like your laugh there, Charlie. 
[04:02:30]  Good.  Now we've got to try to make you laugh again, because they want to hear that.  Let's make them laugh.  Yeah?  Two Jews walk into a bar.  They own it.  Yeah.  Was that funny?  That's funny.  Yeah?  Mm-hmm.  One Jew does Jeff Jam.  No, Jeff Jam.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  I kind of tripped.  I get nervous. 
[04:03:00]  What were you trying to say?  What's that?  I wasn't going to try that again.  You think out of my periphery, I didn't see the finger poised?  Cigars and Scotch wants to call him Blurry Charlie.  Blurry Charlie.  How about Choppy Charlie?  Mm-hmm.  No?  Okay. 
[04:03:30]  How about just Charlie?  Charlie, what's bugging you?  Huh?  Nothing.  Like, you know.  Literally.  Bugs.  What type of bugs are crawling on your body right now?  Like, some people are annoyed at, like, gas prices.  What bugs Charlie?  What bugs after Shock Charlie?  I don't know.  Nothing.  Really?  I don't know.  Do you get laid?  Just nervous, that's all.  Do you get laid?  Yeah.  Do you like plasticids?  I don't know.  I would imagine you spill a lot of semen in your underpants. 
[04:04:00]  Well, he's nervous, you know.  I think he touches the gun when he explodes.  Yeah, do you shoot quick, Charlie, or are you one of those guys that just can't bust?  Uh-huh.  You know.  Well, depending on the, you know, mood.  Depending on how fat she is, I hear you.  Where do you live?  Mom and Dad?  No.  I live at my house.  How old are you?  27? 
[04:04:30]  No.  Yeah.  30, not?  He might.  39.  Okay, cool.  30 flurf.  You don't look 30 flurf.  You look a lot younger than 39, Charlie.  You're doing something right.  67?  June, June 29th.  Oh, June.  Okay.  Yeah.  Looks like you're shaking all the cholesterol out of your system.  Yeah.  Jesus.  I like you, Charlie. 
[04:05:00]  Mm-hmm.  I hope you like us.  I do.  Obviously, you do.  You got the wow hat on, and we're beating you up.  Typical for this dumb show.  Well, we're having fun with Charlie, but he's a good boy.  We get monsters in here, and we're as good as could possibly be.  So nothing bugs you?  Uh, no.  Not really.  When was the last time you got late?  Uh, well, uh, months ago.  Months?  Yeah.  Was it good?  Two months?  Yeah. 
[04:05:30]  Did you make comesies quick?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Who was his lucky yell?  Hooker?  No.  No.  No.  Friend.  Friend.  Friend.  Friend.  Yep.  Friend.  Friend.  Was she hot?  Uh, I don't know.  Like, between a one and a ten, uh, what was she?  Wow, you didn't come up with that scale.  Did you, uh, how do I phrase this delicately?  Did you put it where the shit comes out?  Your tact is amazing, Jim. 
[04:06:00]  Well, I'm guessing she was about a...  Three and a half?  Yeah.  Uh, five.  Five?  How tall is she?  Uh, my height.  Okay, about, what, five nine?  Yeah, five.  How much do you weigh?  Uh, 120.  Mm-hmm.  Okay, 120.  Not bad.  Did her pussy smell?  Uh, a little, right?  Uh, yeah.  Stunk a little?  Yeah, I did.  Yeah.  When she wanted you to go down on her, did she say, why don't you go kiss Staten Island? 
[04:06:30]  Um, no.  Sam, what's the YouTube cry for help video?  I saw a teen crying her eyes out.  Uh, we'll get right on it.  Into the camera.  Yeah, we'll get right on that.  That's all.  Just one of the guys, you know, before they do something, uh, like remove it or, uh, teen  cry for help.  Yeah.  So, so it was good sex?  Yeah, it was.  Mm-hmm.  What'd you say when you came?  Do you have something that you say?  Uh, no. 
[04:07:00]  Uh, nothing.  I don't know.  I always say something sexy when I cum.  Mm-hmm.  Like if I'm inside of a woman, as I'm dumping my load in her, I'll just go, oh, we're gonna  put this thing through college.  Maybe we should have Charlie, uh, uh, read, you know, cum lines.  Oh, by the way, my friend who wrote Dirty Literature.  What?  What, Jimmy?  What?  My buddy, uh, my gay friend, he's a waiter.  Oh.  And he's a very funny guy, but he wrote all that X-rated shit, and he agreed. 
[04:07:30]  He's waiting for a cock.  What's that?  No, nothing.  A waiter.  He came into, uh, no, no, W-A-D-E-R.  Oh, well.  He's always in water.  Yeah.  No, no, W-E-A-I-G-H-T-E-R.  He goes to the gym.  Yes.  And you know it bombed, so I put Steve's voice in it.  Now he bombed, not me.  It was the captain.  But he'll come in and read some of the shit that he wrote, but he wrote, like, bestiality  porn, but he wrote books.  So we should have Charlie read some of that stuff.  Yes.  Uh, Charlie, are you on any of the, um, message boards or anything? 
[04:08:00]  Um, no.  No?  You have a go on PalTalk?  Yes, his name on the message board is...  Thank you guys very much.  Appreciate that.  Oh.  So, uh, did she, uh, did she, uh, how do I phrase this delicately?  Mm-hmm.  Did she have a good pooper?  Oh, she, uh, she, uh, she, yeah, she did.  Mm-hmm.  Did she, um, did she take the baby maker and then go... 
[04:08:30]  Oh.  Did she suck it?  Whoa, yeah?  Did she suck it the way, like, a lamb sucks a bottle when you hold it in the cage?  Uh, yeah.  Did she suck it, like, a calf on a teat?  Huh?  When you came, were you perfectly still?  Hey, is Roland?  Is Roland?  I see, because that's the opposite.  Did she eat your ass?  I don't know.  Oh, bad shit.  Is she fucking religious?  Is Roland here?  Should have Roland interview, uh, Charlie.  Oh, yeah, Roland's a fucking good interviewer, man. 
[04:09:00]  Yeah, Roland can get that shit done, man.  Roland's a motherfucking powerful interviewer.  He's a badass motherfucker.  I'll see.  Why?  Why?  Uh...  I'm so tired right now, I just want to lay in my bed and shit.  Well, all right.  Roland, can you interview Charlie for us?  For a minute.  For a minute?  Sit down.  Come on, Roland.  You want to get more involved with the on-air portion of the show?  Yeah, Roland, you're really good, like, at getting to the heart of the matter, so...  Someone said we ought to call him.  Blah, blah, blah. 
[04:09:30]  All right, Charlie...  Blah!  Here's Roland interviewing Charlie.  Get to know Charlie for us, Roland.  Sit down, Charlie.  We like him standing.  How do you want to stand?  I guess.  My mic.  Um, I don't know, um, fuck.  How do you feel about, I don't know, how long have you listened to the show for?  Um, well, about, uh, ever since 92.  Um, I mean, um, about 10 years.  I'm not 10 years, sorry. 
[04:10:00]  Uh, about 8 years.  8 years, okay.  Um, um.  Did you ever see Jimmy perform live before?  Yep.  Mm-hmm.  Where?  Mm-hmm.  Um, uh, actually, um, a couple of times at, uh, the old, uh, old, old Westbury back in  the day.  Mm-hmm.  Yep.  Um. 
[04:10:30]  You thought you were seeing Jimmy in the round, but, uh, you were mistaken.  Yep.  Yeah.  Sorry, that's another movement joke, yeah.  Yeah.  Uh-huh.  Uh, I don't know.  Roland, you're usually good with the questions.  What's wrong with you today?  I gotta fire him out rapidly.  I don't know.  Like, questions like the listeners want to know about.  Like, how big his cock is.  Oof.  Um.  There you go.  How big is your cock?  Oh.  Um. 
[04:11:00]  About a six and a quarter, man, are you, Charlie?  Oh.  Yeah, about that side.  Yep.  You ever measure it, slash, accidentally slap it with a ruler?  Uh, no, no.  No.  No.  Thanks, man.  Sure.  You ever squeeze it hard and yell at it?  What?  Uh-huh.  Did Russell Simmons have fun?  Uh, I think so.  Uh-oh.  Uh-oh.  What does that mean?  What happened?  Oh, no, nothing.  He was talking to him?  No, he had to run to a meeting. 
[04:11:30]  Yeah.  His life work.  Yeah.  No, it wasn't.  Yeah.  How come his publicist didn't like us?  Yeah, what did we do wrong?  No, she liked them.  She didn't like it.  I'm kidding, no.  But why?  I'm kidding.  Why do I have to be the butt of the joke, Roland?  I'm kidding.  Why do I have to be the butt of the joke?  No, he had a meeting at 11 a.m.  That he was late for.  He what?  Had to go to across town.  Had to go to 11 a.m.  And then he was late for.  All right, well, I guess we've got to wrap up now.  We're trying to figure out Charlie, so.  Charlie, you're a keeper. 
[04:12:00]  Did he come with friends?  Uh, no.  Do you have friends?  Yeah.  Okay, good, good, good.  That's good.  Everybody needs friends.  Mm-hmm.  All right, Charlie.  All right.  Um, you want to get naked?  Jesus.  20 bucks if you run around naked.  You run in a circle naked.  No, I'm saying.  No, that's okay.  All right, we'll make it 40.  Yeah.  How about this?  How much would you want to run around, like, naked in this area yelling,  what's the hullabaloo?  Uh, the hullabaloo?

Yeah, of course she is.  Outraged, uh.  What'd they do?  She's at who-hoo.  Yeah, she's suing Howard.  Why?  Uh, they altered her voice to say crazy shit.  From her book.  It's a joke.  If you take, yeah, oh, what?  Like they did with the Harry Potter thing?  Yeah.  What a fucking baby.
