<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opened with the hosts, Opie and Anthony, along with Jim Norton and Drew Boogie in studio, engaging in self-deprecating humor about their abrasive style and frequent use of offensive language.  They immediately launched into a discussion about Alec Baldwin's angry voicemail message left for his young daughter, sharing personal anecdotes about the challenges of divorce and its impact on children, with Norton contributing his own experiences.  The voicemail itself was played multiple times throughout the broadcast, often with comedic sound effects added.  The hosts debated the appropriateness of airing the audio, ultimately deciding to play it repeatedly and analyzing Baldwin’s reaction and subsequent statement to *Extra*.  Baldwin’s use of the word "pig" was a particular point of contention.  Bob Saget, who joined the show later, also commented on the voicemail, expressing sadness and concern about the situation.

A substantial portion of the show was dedicated to a scathing New York Times article by Jacques Steinberg criticizing their handling of the Virginia Tech shooting coverage, specifically their on-air reading of the shooter's play, "Richard McBeef."  Opie and Anthony vehemently defended their actions, arguing that they satirized the shooter, not the victims. They compared their coverage to that of other talk radio personalities like Rush Limbaugh, Michael Savage, and Neil Bortz, also mentioned in the article, highlighting what they perceived as inconsistencies in the criticism.  They also heavily criticized NBC's coverage of the shooting for repeatedly airing the shooter’s video.  The hosts repeatedly demanded that Steinberg contact them for a rebuttal.  A Virginia Tech alum called in, requesting the hosts promote a petition to remove media from the campus; they obliged.

The broadcast also featured extensive discussion of the Opie and Anthony comedy tour, including planned appearances by Carlos Mencia, Lewis Black, Jim Norton, Bob Saget, and Louis C.K.  Humorous anecdotes from previous tours were shared, including a contest to find and reward the fattest audience member.  A humorous bit involved speculating on which city would be dropping their show next.  The hosts' unexpected loss of their Winnipeg and Dallas radio shows was announced, accompanied by complaints about the stations' management and a lack of connection with the local audiences.

The show included several calls from listeners, some involved in a conflict between Paul Mercurio, a show spotter for the "Sex for Sam" contest, and a listener referred to as "Flea."  Multiple perspectives were presented regarding this altercation, including conflicting accounts of whether Flea claimed to be an O&A intern. The hosts ultimately declared they were finished with Mercurio.   One particularly combative and profanity-laden call with "Flea" concluded with the hosts cutting him off.  Another listener called in claiming to have lost his radio job for saying "your mom's box." "Cliff Hart" attempted a live radio ad read, which devolved into increasingly awkward and explicit attempts to use the phrase "I love cock."

The show also included a call from comedian Rob Bartlett, who was discussed alongside his appearances on the Imus show and his recent play with Matthew Broderick and Nathan Lane.  Brian Wilson, a weatherman from the Imus show, briefly joined the conversation with some absurd comedic remarks about his future career prospects.  The show featured various other tangents, including stories from the hosts and Bob Saget about near bowel accidents on stage, and a recollection of a past stunt involving Bob Saget and Louis Black resulting in an arrest.  Sergeant Magoo and Bobby Bainati from Full Blown AIDS (FBA) appeared in studio, giving the hosts Marine Corps-themed shirts, which prompted further vulgar jokes and conversation.  The show concluded with Anthony Cumia driving home while still on the air, continuing with profane commentary about driving and interacting with listeners until the end of the broadcast. Throughout the entire broadcast, a significant amount of offensive language, sexually explicit content, and crude humor were present.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  The Opie and Anthony Show on XM202 featuring Opie, Anthony, and James Norton.  What do I do with this?  What?  What is this?  Garbage!  You know what? I can't take this anymore.  It's an awful, awful radio show.  We're really, really mean-spirited, evil people who can't see the good in anything.  Off the air, let's say racist things to each other.  All right.  Hold on, hold on.  And really turn them off. 
[00:00:30]  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.  Excellence in broadcasting.  Our anus.  What? Again?  Oh, oh.  Our anus.  What? Stop. Enough about the anus.  Ah, this is hurtful.  This is hurtful. No one wants to hear this on their radio show.  Some collapse on our floor.  It's just potty mouth day.  You may feel shame, but all the same, one night is in pain. 
[00:01:00]  O.B.  Anthony.  Shush.  Jim Norton.  You guys ready to laugh?  It's got to be the greatest thing ever.  I'd sooner have a water drinking contest.  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road. 
[00:01:30]  Man, do we have a lot to do today.  Wake up.  Wake up.  Wake up.  Wake up.  Wake up.  Wake up.  Wake up.  Hi.  Good morning and welcome to the O.B.  and Anthony show. 
[00:02:00]  I want to thank TMZ.com for the audio of the day.  Yeah, that's a good one.  Alec Baldwin.  Oh, you blew it.  You blew it.  Were you going to say who it was?  You should have told me.  You blew it.  You should have told me, don't say who that is.  It's all right.  Oh, no.  Everyone's going to know it's Alec Baldwin by the end of the day.  I was just going to play it and then have a cute little game.  Guess who this is.  Guess who this is. 
[00:02:30]  Kind of in the news, though.  We can still play it.  We're the news.  People don't know crap until they tune into our show.  Do you realize that?  Yeah, we tell people stuff every day.  Let's play the game.  It'll be fun.  No one will know.  No one will know, even though I just said it.  No one is listening.  It's still groggy.  Someone hit snooze.  It's so funny you just said it's in the news, but see, to a lot of people, they went to bed  around 10, 11 o'clock last night.  Their alarm clocks are going off, and they're getting actual info from you and I. 
[00:03:00]  From us.  Scary?  Indeed.  We get to tell people stuff for the first time.  See, when we were doing afternoons, that's why we kind of did more of a goof show, because  all the news was already done.  It was already out there.  Everyone knew it.  So it gave us plenty of time for strippers and drinking.  Just think if we were irresponsible broadcasters, the fun we could have goofing on people with  fake catastrophes and other things that are against FCC regulations. 
[00:03:30]  Regulations.  Regulations.  Imagine that.  We just get on every day with a new fake catastrophe from around the world.  Speaking of which, I might have to pay $5,000.  Ugh.  Great.  I'm going to get into that another day.  Oh, boy.  It's the Opie and Anthony Show.  Good morning.  Our phone number...  Come here, bag of shells.  Phone number is 1-866-313-FREE.  This is Alec Baldwin.  This is Alec Baldwin. 
[00:04:00]  Dave, we can stay with all theken size, and he is good. 
[00:04:30]  It is all in this thug.  What's our case?  And so that's a big deal.  We can stay with this.  Thank you. 
[00:05:00]  Thank you. 
[00:05:30]  Thank you. 
[00:06:00]  What's that problem?  Does anyone know the problem with the audio?  On our end, it was clear as day.  The meters were fine.  Everything was fine. 
[00:06:30]  What's the problem with the audio?  Someone tell me what's wrong with the audio.  The XM side was having a problem.  The XM side?  Yeah.  Regular radio got it?  That's what I was reading.  Why would that happen?  I don't know.  It's had a phase, maybe.  Remember that whole thing?  Did you hear it on regular radio?  Yeah.  Is that all that matters?  Yeah.  We'll play it unedited over there anyway.  Can we find out what's going on?  That audio sounds okay on XM.  Wait, wait, wait.  You mean it's got to be recorded a certain way for it to play on XM, right? 
[00:07:00]  And it says clear on FM.  I'm getting it that it's clear on both.  I got a lot of instant feedback saying it was really, really low.  Eh, turn it up.  And some of the guys that are pretty reliable, not just some fake name that comes out of  nowhere and trashes the show.  Boy, I wonder what that is.  What do we got?  Eh, E-Rock's got it.  Oh, E-Rock.  Yes.  I just heard it on the delay, which how the FM would hear it and how it would go through  XM.  It sounded fine.  Okay.  All right.  Well, some people maybe got to get the wax out of their ears. 
[00:07:30]  I don't know.  Something's going on because too many people writing in.  But anyway, there you go.  Alec Baldwin leaving a message for his 11 or 12-year-old daughter.  Yeah.  A little pissed off.  I think she's 11 is what they're reporting.  But he kind of doesn't know.  He don't know.  That is a guy who is talking to his daughter over the answering machine with nothing but  the thought of his wife in his head.  Yeah.  Like he's talking to a little girl, his daughter, like he should be talking to his ex-wife. 
[00:08:00]  That's not the way you talk to your little girl.  It is.  That's horrible.  It sounds awful.  I don't like his daughter.  Just on that message, I'm already siding with him.  Really?  Yes.  Because she apparently wasn't taking his phone calls.  You know the mother's probably just filling the daughter's head with stuff.  It's textbook divorce crap when a kid is involved.  What you do is you bad mouth the other parent. 
[00:08:30]  That's exactly what happens.  You know what?  I got to interrupt you because I know you're going to go off on something here.  No.  I'm sitting here going, how would you know this crap?  You hate kids.  You don't want to be married and all that.  I'm like, oh my God.  This is going to pass to you as a little fella.  I was Lil' Anthony when my parents got divorced.  Way before the goatee and the well-kept hair.  Oh, yeah.  Yes.  I was just a little mess. 
[00:09:00]  A little ragamuffin is what I was.  I'm sitting here like you're an expert on a lot of things, but how are you an expert on  this textbook divorce crap?  Divorce was just like, I guess when you reach a certain age, it's still traumatic, but at  my age at the time, and it lasted so long.  I wish my parents either didn't get divorced or got it over with because I told the stories  before.  They just were at each other all the time, and the divorce thing kind of just lingered 
[00:09:30]  on for what seemed like forever as a kid.  And then, you know, you kind of, I'm sitting there thinking about the situation and just  wishing, like, and I remember thinking to myself, oh, my parents can't get divorced.  Like, that can't happen to me.  Like, so it won't happen.  No, I know that, and I'm rationalizing in my little head.  I'm only like, I guess, eight years old when like that whole thing started.  Maybe even seven, because I realized they were just arguing all the time, and I'm like, 
[00:10:00]  oh my God, what if they get divorced?  No, no, I can't do, but they won't, they won't, because they're my parents, and that  can't happen to me.  And then one day, mommy called us in to the room and told us to sit down, and she had something  to tell us.  Oh, no.  And she started with the whole preface of, you know, I just want you kids to all know  that this has nothing to do with you.  It's not your fault.  Like, she read something, how to tell kids that you're getting a divorce, you know? 
[00:10:30]  Divorce for dummies.  Yeah, divorce for dummies.  That's what my mother was reading.  Divorce for dummies.  Make sure you sit down, your kid.  How to tell your kids.  Make them sit down.  Make sure you reinforce that it wasn't their fault.  So, you know, she's just telling us it's not your fault.  She goes, and then she kind of, like, popped it out almost in a happy way.  She was like, I just want to tell you kids that me and your father are getting a divorce. 
[00:11:00]  Like, if she puts it, it goes up at the end.  Everything's fine.  The house is on fire.  She presented it like a kid's show.  Yeah, it was.  It was like a kid's show.  It was like one of these things where they bring kids in and you explain things to them.  Is it true she was dressed as a clown with floppy shoes?  Yeah, floppy shoes that exploded at the end with a big exploding cigar.  With all sorts of distractions, balloon animals.  Oh, I don't know.  She told us and then had to run out and go to work. 
[00:11:30]  Oh, really?  I remember my mom doing, too.  And then you guys had to just sit around at home by yourselves just kind of getting really sad.  We were latchkey kids.  And then we just played this over and over again.  You are never to blame.  We aren't, Mommy?  You are never to blame.  Yeah, but I kind of feel like maybe if we were more quieted.  You are never to blame.  Okay.  Well, what do I have to look forward to for the rest of my life?  Are you shook up?  Are you nervous?  Yeah, I guess I am. 
[00:12:00]  Just a little bit.  Maybe that's why I was a little scaredy cat my whole life.  I don't know.  Are you a scaredy cat?  It's a scaredy cat.  I was scared of everything.  I told you that story.  I was like, Mom would leave.  Remember back in the old days when your parents would just leave you in a car?  It was okay.  Roll the windows down like you're a cocker spaniel.  Yeah.  Or something.  And just roll the windows down a little and go, I'll be right out.  Leave the car running.  She would get her nails and hair done.  It doesn't matter.  You're just sitting out there for hours.  You're just sitting out there for hours.  And kid time is like you tack on three more hours of what it feels like. 
[00:12:30]  Just collecting candy from all sorts of creeps.  That's it.  They're coming up to the window.  Hi.  It's like a frigging smorgasbord for perverts.  They walk around the parking lot taking their choice of kids.  I'd like something a little darker than you.  No, I'm going to move on to this.  Oh, that's a pretty girl.  Yeah.  It's just awful.  They would leave you in the car, but rarely anything would happen.  You're just kind of in the car.  But apparently one of her bosses had seen her and wanted to see us. 
[00:13:00]  I guess he had seen her walking into the store and talked to her.  And she goes, oh, yeah, my kids are in the car.  And he was like, oh, I'll say hello to them.  So he comes by the car and the windows are down a little bit.  And he walks over and knocks on the window.  At which point, like, my brother turns around and my sister turns around and looks at him.  I looked and went, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, mommy, mommy. 
[00:13:30]  I lost my mind.  All these images of this guy kidnapping us and stuff went through my head in a split second.  I was petrified.  I was a crier as well growing up.  Just a nervous little Nelly.  I was, God, we're so alike.  I mean, we've said it over the years, but first day of kindergarten, ah, I was the kid mom had to pick up five minutes later.  Oh, I was that kid.  Oh, at least you got picked up.  I was that kid. 
[00:14:00]  You got picked up.  With me, it was like prison.  She walked me in and didn't tell me what was going to be happening.  So she goes, it's your first day of school.  Uh, school, you're going to kindergarten.  And I'm dressed up in a little, like, suit.  Like, I'm going to be making business deals in kindergarten.  I'd like to sell you some insurance.  Those pictures are hilarious.  Oh, yeah.  Back up on the website.  Anthony dressed up in little suits as a kid.  Suit and tie.  What am I doing?  Suit, tie, and wild hair.  And wild hair and a briefcase. 
[00:14:30]  Yeah.  What the hell do I need a briefcase for?  So it's like my first day, I'm going into kindergarten, and mommy's with me.  Like, she has been since I was born.  You know, mommy's always there to help out.  So she walks me up to the front door of the elementary school kindergarten class.  And Ms. Mulder, my kindergarten teacher, comes to meet me.  And now I'm starting to think maybe mom knew I was a little faggot crybaby and called up in advance and said, 
[00:15:00]  Look, I'm going to the door.  You meet them.  Like, there had to be this whole thing planned out.  So she meets me at the door and takes my hand and goes,  Hi, Anthony.  We're going to go inside and color and do fun things.  And I remember this distinctly, too.  So I'm like, that sounds great.  Me?  Mama, watch me?  This is going to be fantastic.  Because now I'm under the impression that mommy follows me in.  Yeah, this is like a vacation from life, you're thinking.  I'm finally out of the house, me and mom.  This is your first vacation, you're thinking.  Right. 
[00:15:30]  Me and mom are going on vacation to this place where you color and play with glue.  Well, to a kid, that's like going down to the Caribbean.  Right.  And drinking some beers and looking at paves.  Club med with mom.  It's club med for a little kid.  So, so, so, uh, Ms. Mulder, Ms. Mulder, she was from Holland.  She takes my hand and starts walking me towards the classroom.  Now, I look back and I see those school double doors close and makes that noise. 
[00:16:00]  Like a prison cell.  Yeah, and mommy's on the other side of the doors, I notice.  She's kind of looking at me and I got my head over my shoulder and it's all, you know, you  get a little kindergarten brain.  It's all coming together now.  I'm going, wait a minute.  She's out there.  I'm in here.  I don't know this Ms. Mulder woman from a hole in the wall.  She's dragging me further away from mommy.  Now I look and mommy turns around and starts walking away.  Oh, no.  I lose my mind again. 
[00:16:30]  Where I'm, I'm now, I break away from Ms. Mulder and I'm pounding on the door.  I'm, I'm like Dustin Hoffman on The Graduate.  He's like, mommy.  No, no, no, it's weird about this whole story.  Uh, you had the same reaction, uh, your first day of marriage.  Yes, exactly.  Ah, what'd I do?  Mommy, mommy, help me.  Well, mommy couldn't help you because you were 30 years old.  I was already 30 and married. 
[00:17:00]  I wish mommy could have helped.  Oh, it was horrible.  You wanted mommy to come by with some coloring books.  Yeah.  So, so, you know, she, uh, obviously left me there and things kind of worked out.  But, but the divorce thing, yeah, she gave us the speech and that was that, you know,  but then for a few years there was this just back and forth bad mouthing of each other.  You know, I'd go and visit dad and he'd bad mouth mom and vice versa. 
[00:17:30]  They would talk to each other through the, through you guys, right?  Yeah.  That's good.  Oh, what's your dad doing now?  Oh, so how was your weekend with dad?  Oh, it was fun.  Uh, you know, we went to a bar in Mineola and, um, I sat and ate peanuts and I was able  to throw the shells on the floor.  Oh, that's great.  Good.  A weekend of drinking.  That's your father.  I'm a kid.  Could you stop?  Do parents realize what they're doing to the kids when they do that?  No, not at all. 
[00:18:00]  Because to bring it right around, because we've got to take a break, uh, Alec Baldwin, I mean,  these two have been going at it for years.  I mean, these stories have been in the paper off and on for many, many years.  And, and obviously he really needs to, to, to talk to, to what's her name there?  Uh, I forgot what, uh, uh, Kim, Kim Basinger.  Kim Basinger.  He obviously has a lot more to say to her, but I guess there must be some kind of restraining  order or, or she just never answers the phone.  Right.  So now he's, he is beyond frustrated to the point he's taking it out on his daughter.  But, but like you said, that's how you talk to your ex-wife. 
[00:18:30]  He's basically talking to his ex-wife.  Yeah.  Your 11 year old daughter.  So, uh, and how nice is it, by the way, that NBC is getting all this crap.  How nice is this?  Oh, that's an, oh yeah.  We'll get, yeah.  We'll get, yeah.  After the break.  I think we started that whole thing.  So, uh, TMZ.com.  Thanks for the audio.  Yeah, we're going to try to get a better copy and, uh, we'll play it again sometime  this morning.  But, uh, there you go.  Alec Baldwin talking to his 11 year old daughter.  What a sweetheart.  Lots of Father's Day cards in his future, I'm sure.  Oh my God.  That's going to hurt him with visitation and everything.  Oh yeah. 
[00:19:00]  Oh, they already took that away.  That was a, they took, they temporarily have taken his, uh, visitation rights away.  When he said, uh, for May 4th.  When he said he's going to come there, fly there and straighten her ass out.  Yeah.  It was, uh, it was a threat.  Well, they, they, of course, her side is going to be like, well, that's a threat.  And with the school shootings and stuff, we have this type of thing.  He can't see her now.  All right.  Creep though.  Hey, we're getting warmed up.  Uh, we'll have more on the Alec Baldwin thing.  We'll play the audio just in case it was a little too low for everybody. 
[00:19:30]  And, uh, traveling virus tickets going on sale today, uh, at nine o'clock.  The pre-sale was, uh, a smash success to say the least.  Smashing.  Yeah.  I could tell you guys this much.  Uh, Jones Beach sold out of the pre-sale tickets.  Now the rest of the tickets for the Jones Beach show goes on sale with all the other cities today.

We forgot to mention that Mencia, Carlos Mencia, somebody asked me about him. 
[00:21:00]  He's going to be on the shows in Boston, Detroit, and, um, there was one more I should probably know offhand.  DC.  Okay, DC, Boston, and Detroit.  Uh, those are, are three shows he will be appearing on.  Yeah, we've been on in DC off and on for years, and we're finally doing a real event down there.  I can't wait.  I can't wait for all the shows, but DC, uh, is one of the ones I'm really looking forward to because we haven't really hung with those people yet.  Yes, and, uh, Lynch is doing, uh, uh, Lynch is doing, uh, Jones Beach, uh, with us.

We're going to add some more comedians.  And, and I was, uh, I was, uh, in contact with, uh, Buffalo yesterday, man.  I, I want us to be in, uh, I want us to go to Buffalo with this thing badly.  Yeah, we have to.  So we're trying to figure it out.  I mean, we're just blowing up in Buffalo, and I, I think it would be a great market.  It'll be the first time we've been back there since, uh, uh, TNA with ONA.  So I think, I think we need to go back there.  So hopefully they'll work out those details in the coming weeks.

Is it Syracuse we're saying goodbye to today?  Dave, a little worried that it might be Syracuse.  Come Monday, one of these cities will not be here in the Opie and Anthony show anymore.  We'll tell you a little later, all right? 
[00:25:00]  Thanks, guys.  All right.  For one city, the O&A virus has been cured.  They've found a cure.  They've found a cure.  They've inoculated the city.  We'll let you know what city later on on the Opie and Anthony show.  Hey, we made the New York Times.  Oh.  I don't know if it's good that we made the New York Times, quite frankly.  I like the way this person addressed it.  Because it's the tone of the article that is more of this phony news morality that doesn't 
[00:25:30]  get what we're doing here and got things, little details that they get wrong that is  an attempt to get people in trouble.  Yeah, so we want to address this and, you know, tell our side of this, and then we'll  move on to other things.  But New York Times today.  The article is written by Jacques Steinberg.  Yeah, let's get Jacques Steinberg on the phone today.  Headline, talk radio tries for humor and a political advantage. 
[00:26:00]  And it starts right off the bat.  Opie and Anthony, a radio show originating in New York that once broadcast the sounds  of two people purportedly having sex.  Basically, the first line of this is absolutely wrong.  Of course it is.  We never broadcasted the sounds of two people having sex.  When are they going to get that right?  Purportedly having sex.  Purportedly.  Covered himself.  Barely.  With a word most people don't understand the meaning of.  By the way, how's your research coming with the AIDS cure? 
[00:26:30]  Because mine's coming along pretty good.  I figure once we cure AIDS, that will be taken off of every comment we have in the news,  the same past thing.  Then it'll be Opie and Anthony, who, as you know, cured AIDS.  I'm almost there.  I got beakers in my apartment.  Yeah, mine are bubbling.  And I got like monkey carcasses hanging from the ceiling.  I'm almost there.  Almost there.  Yeah, I'm figuring out some different type of formulas.  So purportedly having sex at St. Patrick's Cathedral.  Did not take long to try to extract some humor from the massacre at Virginia Tech on Monday. 
[00:27:00]  I don't like that line either.  Nope.  Did not take long to try to extract some humor from the massacre at Virginia Tech on Monday.  That's a little vague on what we were doing, what this bit that he's going to comment on now is all about.  And the fact that we're extracting like there's nothing there and they tried and it's, you know,  he's already going into the insensitivity thing. 
[00:27:30]  Instead of realizing the way we were attacking, the way the disgusting media has been handling this whole thing,  he does that because, again, he's a part of the media.  Yeah, exactly.  Well, Jacques Steinberg obviously doesn't listen to the Opie and Anthony show.  This was brought to his attention.  He probably got a little audio clip.  This is what usually happens, you know, a 15-minute bit that we did one day this week.  Jacques Steinberg.  I don't know.  Where is my yummica?  Yeah. 
[00:28:00]  He's not going to talk about how we were beyond outraged all week.  He's not going to talk about how we just took nothing but phone calls day after day,  talked to people that knew some of the victims, talked to people that knew the shooter.  Yeah.  The outrage we have for the media for showing the video manifesto, ignoring all that,  and just focusing on one bit we did.  And just after 8.30 a.m. Wednesday, the show's two hosts, Greg Hughes, Opie, and Anthony Cumia,  Anthony, staged an on-air reading of a play that had been written by the killer and posted on the Internet. 
[00:28:30]  Mm-hmm.  Titled Richard McBeef.  Richard McBeef.  The play is a tale of betrayal, murder, and child molestation.  The guy, he writes about this like he's reviewing a Broadway show.  Like it was a work of Shakespeare.  No, Romeo and Juliet was a tale of something.  This was just crap written in a childlike cadence by a pseudo-adult.  It was drivel from an immature murderer.  And we read the script with various characters from the show because it stunk. 
[00:29:00]  It was an awful play.  Absolutely.  So we decided to, you know, to act out one of these really awful plays.  Titled Richard McBeef.  The play is a tale of betrayal, murder, and child molestation.  Subjects that the two hosts and a supporting ensemble approach with little melodrama.  What were we supposed to?  We supposed to give the garbage, this jerk off road, like it was a real work. 
[00:29:30]  We weren't respecting the works of Cho.  We made fun of him.  That's what we did.  That's what the media should be doing.  That's how you should be painting this kid.  Yeah.  Not with video manifestos and rambling letters and this fake news.  Let's try to figure out what was in his mind instead of the sensational presentation of a murderer talking after he's dead.  That's the only reason that was played.  What we were doing is putting him in the light he should be put in. 
[00:30:00]  A lunatic, weirdo, jackass, immature, selfish bastard that killed 30 people, over 30 people, including himself.  He wasn't mysterious.  Yeah, get over it.  Powerful figure.  He was a little jerk off who snapped.  He had mental problems and he snapped.  He was a self-centered little brat.  Yeah, his own grandfather's coming out today saying he's happy he's dead, right? 
[00:30:30]  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah, unhappy.  But Jacques isn't going to talk about all that other angles and ways we talked about this horrific tragedy.  No, I am Jacques.  Look quickly.  I must get to Temple.  Approach with little, little mellow drama.  When the production was over, they cheered themselves with cries of bravo, bravo, before being interrupted by the clatter of what sounded like automatic gunfire.  And we didn't cheer ourselves with bravo, bravo.  We have to correct him again.  It was the sarcastic slow clap that every stupid teen movie does after some drippy nonsense happens. 
[00:31:00]  That's what that was.  It was beyond sarcastic.  Of course it was.  Beyond sarcastic.  And then it was bravo, bravo, author, author.  Right.  Calling the lunatic out onto the stage where he then eliminated the cast of that horrible play, which was us and himself.  Nothing about the victims was ever goofed on or in this segment, which this guy kind of hints to that it was. 
[00:31:30]  Like, why don't you get the details right, you jerk off Jacques Steinberg?  This is how things snowball and how people get in trouble in this day and age.  What are you trying to get us in trouble, Jacques?  You want to start the next Imus thing?  You're not going to sit here and take this phony, half-assed excuse for journalism.  You kidding me?  There's so many people out there that are trying to get the next Imus thing. 
[00:32:00]  Oh, of course.  They want to be the next newsbreaker that goes, hey, hey, that guy that got fired?  That was me.  And what happened?  I started that one rolling.  And what's scary, this is how the media frenzy starts, because now anyone else reading this, they're not even going to listen to our explanation.  They're not going to search out the audio to see for themselves.  Now, because it's in print, this is exactly what we did, and we were making fun of victims.  Right.  Which is just so far from the truth.  You're a lousy journalist.  Do your research.  There's nothing that makes me sick more than a lazy journalist. 
[00:32:30]  Yep.  A lazy reporter.  You're a lazy Jacques.  And so, yeah, automatic gunfire, what, too much?  One of the participants could be heard saying in a broadcast heard in New York on FNY, which is owned by CBS Radio.  See, even getting the little things in there, you know, just in case you're outraged, this station is WFNY FM, and it's owned by CBS Radio.  He's already trying to set this up for the next media frenzy.  And then someone said, yeah, a little bit, a little bit.  Someone responded, not enough time's gone by. 
[00:33:00]  Careful.  See, I don't like the way he doesn't catch the tone of the show in that one either.  Right.  And he knows what he's doing.  No one said, like, oh, God, why'd you do that?  We're in touch.  Hey, careful.  And then, of course, the article goes on and on, but basically says, only a week after Don Imus was fired for making a racially and sexually charged aside about the women's past, blah, blah, blah,  his former colleagues across the spectrum of talk radio have wrestled with how far they can go in sounding off and even mining for a few laughs on the violence at Virginia Tech. 
[00:33:30]  Some of the most prominent hosts, including Rush Limbaugh, Michael Savage, and Neil Bortz.  Neil Bortz.  Neil Bortz is in an article with us.  You have shown little restraint.  And then it gives some other examples.  Speaking on Wednesday on his syndicated program, which is heard on more than 600 stations, Mr. Limbaugh argued that future tragedies could be prevented by a law banning political correctness. 
[00:34:00]  Can you back up one second?  You missed the way he glitzed.  Go ahead.  Read it to me.  Later in the article.  But he said this, after all, is an incident in which many of the themes often serve as a grist for those hosts and their callers, including immigration, gun control, and the aggressive coverage of national media, NBC, in the parentheses, NBC initially broadcast the suspect's multimedia manifesto.  Is that all he says about NBC or is it a little bit more?  Yeah, the outrage should be all about NBC today, and our papers are definitely showing that, which is very cool to see.  In fact, this dummy, this lazy dummy, focuses on what we did improperly and not the disgusting ratings-grabbing thing NBC did. 
[00:34:30]  It shows you how biased and how out of touch a lot of the media is.  How about writing what we did since this event happened?  What we've done talking about how the media has handled the victims and their families atrociously?  How they've pumped up this murdering crybaby to hero status for any lunatic out there that's watching their program, playing it over and over and over again. 
[00:35:00]  You couldn't watch the news yesterday.  News.  You couldn't watch the TV because they were breaking into programming on regular TV shows to show that idiot's face and insult the families of the victims.  And they promoted it for the next morning.  Yeah, promoting it for the next morning, and we commented on that.  We bashed the hell out of them yesterday before any news organization even picked up on the fact that people were getting pissed off that they were running this footage of this lunatic. 
[00:35:30]  And when we read the likes of Richard McBeefe, if you're not familiar with it, it is a tale of betrayal, murder, and child molestation as per Jacques Steinberg.  Oh, I will make some matzo a prove.  Jacques Steinberg.  That's up there as far as weird goes.  It's a little odd.  A little odd. 
[00:36:00]  But, you know, just comment on that.  Take it out of the context of the entire show that we had done and try.  Yeah, you'll be the next guy that breaks the next shock jocks gone wild story.  Just shove it, Jacques.  You and the rest of the media, the blood-hungry media, you're all so holier than thou.  And all of us on radio are just a bunch of clowns waiting to slip up so one of you sharp-witted journalists can pick us out and throw us to the wolves. 
[00:36:30]  Go F yourself.  Go screw.  You're not a journalist.  You're a hack.  We've got to get our audience together and unite because, you know, when it does happen to us, hopefully we'll be able to at least fight back.  We've got to organize the truth before it happens.  You ain't going to hear, I'm sorry, Jacques Steinberg.  Absolutely not.  And then it goes on.  Speaking on Wednesday on a syndicated, okay, a law banning political correctness.  This guy was sending up flares, Mr. Limbaugh said, of Mr. Chow Cho, whose erratic and disturbing behavior had previously caught the attention of some fellow students and the campus police to no avail. 
[00:37:00]  Was everybody so concerned with the trumped-up global warming scare they didn't notice a real threat, for example?  And how about this, Mr. Limbaugh added, the guy is Korean.  He's Asian.  And how many people refused to do anything about it or even complain about it because they would be tagged as racist?  Hmm.  You think that was really going on?  I don't know.  I think Rush pushes things a little far as far as the right, you know, the whole right-wing thing goes. 
[00:37:30]  I mean, it's coming out.  All the signs were there.  But then they've had the experts on TV the last 24 hours.  And the experts are saying, well, what, you know, what can you really do except kind of watch the kid, you know?  Yeah.  There's not much you could do.  You can't just kick the kid out of school and be outraged by, who knows, especially his family and such, you know?  He didn't commit any official crimes, did he?  Yeah.  No, you can't just boot him.  That's what's frustrating about that type of thing. 
[00:38:00]  You live in a free society and mass murder is rare, but, look, occasionally people snap, and you can't just because you think somebody might snap arrest them, unfortunately.  Very good.  And then he continues, if there are copycats who get ideas from the constant playing of these video clips and photos, who's going to be responsible for this, he asked.  It will not be the NRA.  It will not be the fault of the gun that the next user uses, and it will not be the fault of talk radio.  Of NBC, he said, let's set these people up, folks, for what might come after this.  And then, in an effort to link the events of the last two weeks, Mr. Limbaugh said, the only thing that Virginia Tech and the IMA situation have in common is NBC. 
[00:38:30]  Mr. Savage, whose harsh comments about homosexuality resulted in his dismissal from MSNBC, sneered audibly as he referred to Mr. Cho as a senior in English, drawing out the word of emphasis and as what?  Commandant?  Commandant.  Commandant Cho?  Hmm.  I don't know what Mr. Savage was getting at there. 
[00:39:00]  I don't, I'm trying to figure it out on the spot here.  This kid was brainwashed over there, Mr. Savage said.  Later, he added that the only reason Mr. Cho was walking the streets was because liberal scum have, for 30 years, handcuffed the police and the people of this country and made us hostages in their drama.  I don't know how liberals tie into this unless he's talking about the lack of ability to do something once we knew or once society knew that he was a genuine problem and not just a possible thing.  Because the judge even said, this kid's a problem. 
[00:39:30]  Yeah.  And a threat.  And maybe because people come out and go, well, he's got, he's got civil liberties.  You can't just, you know, maybe that's maybe.  All right.  Well, you know, I love how these guys are like real serious talk show hosts and they got to like make these comments and they're serious when they say things like that.  30 years, handcuffed, blah, blah, blah.  And then Rush talking about, you know, they would be tags as racist.  And then they take our dopey comedy show and throw in like our rendition of Richard McBeef.  Right, right.  Can, can you maybe see the difference? 
[00:40:00]  Well, Neil Bortz.  What did Neil Bortz do?  Actually, Mr. Bortz, whose program is broadcast from Atlanta to more than 150 stations, suggested that some responsibility for the extent of the shooting lay with some of the victims, most of whom were shot in classrooms and hallways.  How did he do that?  When the history of this event is written, Mr. Bortz said Wednesday, we will have 25 students standing meekly waiting for this guy to execute them.  Waiting for what?  The government to come save them.  Wow.  Neil Bortz is insane. 
[00:40:30]  What a douche.  Haven't you read the eyewitness accounts?  People like holding the door and getting shot through the door.  People jumping out the window.  And blocking it.  And one of the teachers having bullets ripped through him as he was holding it.  What do you, you faggot.  What do you expect people to do when there's a guy shooting?  Rush him?  I don't think Mr. Bortz knows what it's like to kind of be in that situation.  Maybe you don't react like you think you would in a Die Hard movie.  What an asshole.  Where you slide across the floor.  Yeah, yeah. 
[00:41:00]  You're pulling all kinds of heroic moves.  Maybe you just stand there with your eyes open wide going, oh my God, I'm paralyzed.  Right.  You can't do the Matrix moves in the middle of a school shoot.  Yeah.  Sorry, Neil Bortz.  You're going to bullet time.  Right, right.  It's not like doing the backwards moves.  Man, he's not paying attention.  And he's, you know, supposed to be doing a real talk show.  What a scum.  Neil Bortz.  All you have to do is turn on the news and hear just a couple interviews or read a little  bit of the eyewitness accounts in the paper and you realize these kids were jumping out  windows, breaking legs and arms and such, trying to hold the door closed as the shooters 
[00:41:30]  trying to get back into classrooms.  I'd expect a comment like that out of the Greaseman.  Okay.  When the lead started slinging, Greasemanelli hit the floor.  I drew my own weapon and pow, pow.  And then the arc glance.  What are you doing?  A few moments later as it transitioned to a commercial break, Mr. Bortz paused to play  a snippet of a pop song from the 1980s.  His choice, Hit Me With Your Best Shot by Pat Benatar. 
[00:42:00]  Can that?  That's just going over the top trying to be outrageous.  But what, like, why is that not the lead of the story?  That's a genuine scumbag remark.  If that's taken in context, if he really said that history is going to prove that they  were just meekly waiting to be shot, what do you expect people to do, man?  Like, what would you do?  Yeah.  You really think that when you hear shots and you're cowering because there's somebody  with a gun and you have nothing but a pencil and a stupid book.  You know what?  I'm not going to be an idiot and judge the guy until I would have heard the whole segment. 
[00:42:30]  Yeah.  That's what I'm saying.  If it's in context.  The same thing could be happening to him in this arc.  Exactly.  What happened to us, but, you know.  Why wouldn't it be?  This Jacques Steinberg probably got it all wrong.  I'm sure a lot of people have played it out the last few days.  Let's say someone comes into your work, God forbid, with an automatic weapon.  What are you really going to do?  You're not charging the guy.  You're going to try to find some kind of cover right away.  You're going to try to leave the office, leave your cubicle, leave your room, jump out  a window.  People have always criticized groups of people that have been held hostage by one guy or maybe 
[00:43:00]  a couple of guys when you have a large group of people as to why there wasn't a rush, why  you didn't just rush.  And it takes a while because, like I said in some other situation, I think it was the 9-11 situation, there's always this hope.  Sure.  There's like hope can be a very dangerous thing when you're at the end of a gun, you know,  the wrong end of a gun or when you're on an airplane that is hijacked and until the plane 
[00:43:30]  that crashed in Pennsylvania, when those people knew what was happening and knew there wasn't  any hope that they were actually going to land and be just a victim of a hijacking, that's  when they took action.  So when something like this happens initially, you still have this hope and the reality of  your entire life is the context you're taking it in.  So you're not a guy in the army, you're not an action hero, you're a student.  So you're hoping that this goes away, you're hoping it plays out that way and the second 
[00:44:00]  the shooting starts, it's pretty much too late, you know, so you're not, you haven't made a  plan with everybody, you're just then scrambling like a scared rabbit trying to get out of the  way of danger.  And there's no, there's no elected leader.  Right.  So what happens is a guy walks in with a gun and so he didn't take him hostage, he just  started firing.  So what a group of people who are not a group, they're a bunch of students, they're supposed  to acknowledge is we are going to charge this guy. 
[00:44:30]  All of us are going to, the three of us do, we're dead.  All of us are going to charge and let's be honest, the first five or six of us will be  popped.  What five or six students are going to say, you know what, I'm willing to be shot for  the rest of these people instead of just like ducking and hoping we're all over here.  And you make a really good point there.  What you're hoping for in a classroom is that everyone has the exact same idea at the exact  same time.  Right.  You don't have a leader that just goes, charge.  You all have to like think that in your own heads at the exact same time. 
[00:45:00]  That's the only way that's ever going to work.  Yeah.  So I might be wrong about Neil Bors.  Like you said, maybe this is taken out of context.  But if it's not, if this is what he said as some smug, fat radio host, he really is  a scumbag.  If that's what he said and that's what he meant, he's a scumbag.  And here's the deal.  Jacques Steinberg, stop hiding behind your keyboard.  We got phone calls in to you.  Someone out there knows Jacques Steinberg.  We want to talk to him today.  We're not hiding.  You shouldn't hide behind your stupid laptop.  And maybe, you know. 
[00:45:30]  Stop being angry typing guy and let's get into some discussion here.  Maybe it will work out.  We didn't like Richard Huff at first, then he called in, and now he's a guy we like  a lot.  He's a good egg.  I can't get enough of Richard Huff.  I'm obsessed with him.  He's my personal life.  He's all I think of.  Yeah, absolutely.  All right.  Hey, we got to take a break.  We got lots going on today.  We got pre-sale tickets for the O&A Traveling Virus Comedy Show.  It's 9 a.m.  Except in D.C., it's 10 a.m.  Tickets go on sale for everybody.  Yesterday, we did a little pre-sale for our hardcore listeners, and we did unbelievable across  the map.  But today, all the shows go on sale for everybody at 9 a.m. 
[00:46:00]  through Ticketmaster.  All the info is up on our website and our MySpace backslash Opie and Anthony.  Also, very, very, very, very, very, it's a very sad day.  One of our cities is hearing us for the last time this morning, and we'll let you know what  city a little later on this morning.  Yes.  We're losing one of our cities, which, honestly, I'm beyond bummed about.  But not surprised because, whatever.  We didn't have much interaction going on with the station from day one. 
[00:46:30]  But we'll let you know what city a little later this morning, okay?  Also in studio today, Drew Boogie playing us in and out of breaks.  Whoa, whoa.  What's up, Steve?  Nothing.  Hello.  I just figured I'd interrupt.  Yeah, what?  Nothing.  You put headphones on, sat in front of a mic.  You got some?  No, I sat four feet away from a mic.  What do I say?  I just wanted to make sure Drew got introduced.  That's all.  All right.  You got Jacques Steinberg?  I have got phone calls into him, emails into him, and a cell phone message as well.  God, come on, Jacques.  Oh, you got a cell phone?  Yeah.  How'd you get that? 
[00:47:00]  You had it?  Who cares?  All right.  Here's Drew Boogie.  Oh, God, I stink. 
[00:47:30]  Oh, God, I stink.  Oh, God.  Oh, God, I stink. 
[00:48:00]  Oh, God, I stink.  It's the Opie and Anthony Show.  You got to get that.  Turn up your shoulder.  You got to get that.  Turn up your shoulder.  You got to get that.  Turn up your shoulder.  You got to get that.  Turn up your shoulder.  Turn up your shoulder.  Turn up your shoulder.  Turn up your shoulder.  Turn up your shoulder.  Turn up your shoulder.  Turn up your shoulder.  Turn up your shoulder.  Turn up your shoulder.  Turn up your shoulder.  Turn up your shoulder.  Turn up your shoulder.  Turn up your shoulder. 
[00:48:30]  Turn up your shoulder.  Turn up your shoulder.  Turn up your shoulder.  Turn up your shoulder.  Turn up your shoulder.  Turn up your shoulder.  Turn up your shoulder.  Turn up your shoulder.  Turn up your shoulder.  Turn up your shoulder.  Turn up your shoulder.  Turn up your shoulder.  Turn up your shoulder.  Turn up your shoulder.  Turn up your shoulder.  Turn up your shoulder.  Turn up your shoulder.  Turn up your shoulder.  Turn up your shoulder.  Wow, a little more Steve in there.  I like that.  Drew Boogie.  Drew Boogie.  Live in studio today.  It's the Opie and Anthony Show.  The ONA virus spreading across America.  Actually, for one city, the virus ends today.  This is the last time you're hearing us live. 
[00:49:00]  We'll tell you which city a little later on this morning.  Which city got inoculated.  Yeah, it sucks.  Just remember, you can hear us on XM Satellite Radio.  So, if you're really, really into the show, at least you can continue listening that way.  Let's say hi to Baba Booey.  Baba Booey.  Oh, boy.  Yeah?  Yeah, you're on the air, sir.  It must be Friday, right?  Howard takes every Friday off.  Yeah, it's Friday.  All right, go ahead, sir. 
[00:49:30]  Yeah, it's Friday, and he's not on.  I switch over and I have to listen to this crap.  You guys are always spewing all this junk about Howard Stern all the time.  Oh, my God.  Dude, can I?  That's why you guys are losing.  That's why you guys are losing.  Just like you said you were going to be.  Hold on, sweetie.  Just wait one minute.  Hold on.  Let me explain something to you, sir.  Wait one minute, sweet boy.  We can have a discussion here, can't we?  Listen, we haven't even talked about Howard since, like, the Imus thing. 
[00:50:00]  We took one quick shot at him.  Yeah, yeah, about the Imus thing, but aside from that, no one's, sir, no one's talking  about Howard.  It's not in the news anymore, so why would we even bother talking about him?  Some people talk about Howard all the time.  Who?  What?  It's not in any news.  Like, there was a big story.  Sir, let me explain something.  Hold on, sweetie.  Let me explain something.  There was a big news story, this shooting in Virginia.  Almost every radio personality of any merit is quoted in a bunch of papers on how they 
[00:50:30]  handled it on talk radio, and not one of them wrote anything about what Howard did.  Tell me this.  Tell me how you're better than Howard, and I'll tell you why you're not.  I'm not saying anything about better, worse.  The fact of the matter is, because that's subjective, the fact of the matter is, though, we have more  listeners than he has, and we get more attention these days.  I will say in the past he did, but since he's moved to Sirius, we get more attention in 
[00:51:00]  the press than he does.  We are now kind of the go-to FM show as far as what's going on in the news and things like  that.  People quote what we say and the comments that we have on the news of the day.  They don't do that with Howard anymore.  We just read an article from the New York Times that we're prominently displaying.  Yeah, that's what we're saying.  There's also in the Daily News and the Post talking about the school shooting as well.  And Howard just kind of disappeared. 
[00:51:30]  You've got to see that, don't you?  But why are you so great if you're losing the city?  Dude, you've got to see that.  You're not admitting something.  You're calling up on an agenda.  You tell us while you're better.  Shut up.  Why don't you just admit what he said was correct?  I'll tell you what's going on, okay?  Yes, we are losing one of the cities today, and it really, really sucks, and we'll name  that city a little later on.  Howard, when he was syndicated, was losing cities all the time as well.  You lose cities, and you pick cities up.  It's the nature of the beast.  That's right.  It's how it works.  And the same thing, yeah, as Opie said, the same thing happened with Howard. 
[00:52:00]  He loses certain cities.  You get certain cities.  You're going to work in certain cities.  You're not going to work in others.  That's just the way it is.  And we handle it differently.  We try to throw all this out on the table for everybody.  Howard, when he lost the city, would just make believe he was never on in that city because  it made him look bad.  But we figured, what the hell?  We might as well fool around with this a little bit today.  So now your turn.  And by the way.  Wait, your turn.  I want to hear him comment a little bit.  Your turn now.  Go ahead.  Okay.  You know why Howard's a lot better than you guys are?  Why? 
[00:52:30]  Because of.  That's why I wanted him to comment.  I swear to you.  I knew this guy.  That's why I wanted to just carry on a conversation.  I knew he was faking it.  I actually didn't.  That one got me.  He got me too.  He was good.  By the way, going into the bathroom, one of our guys around here, that's kind of in the  know, said that Howard did the exact same bit we did with the Richard McBeef play.  Oh, really?  Acting it out and stuff.  And no one paid him a bit of attention on that. 
[00:53:00]  He didn't have the likes of E-Rock in a starring role.  He cast it poorly.  He probably cast it poorly.  Bad direction.  We had Jimmy directing.  He's been on TV.  We all know the key to that play.  And this is what his crew can't do, was the narrative reading of what's inside the parentheses,  which I chose to do myself.  Exactly.  And I chose to see exactly what each character meant.  And yes, young Eric as the girl was sassy.  It was fun.  It was sexy.  And I worked hard and actually got into the Richard McBeef character. 
[00:53:30]  Starring role, by the way.  Still, I still, I'm having trouble letting that character go.  I find myself sometimes walking down the street still thinking I'm Richard McBeef.  I got so into the role.  He taught me a lot.  As a person, I learned a lot from him.  Ugh.  Shut up.  I hate actors.  Here's the latest on the Virginia Tech shooting.  Just keep everyone up to speed.  Now for the latest on the Virginia Tech massacre. 
[00:54:00]  Wounded students got a much-needed morale boost thanks to some welcome visitors.  A marching band?  World War II footage?  Who the hell showed up?  There you go.  And point goes to Jimmy.  That was the line.  Live footage from Times Square?  What's going on?  That was every awful music thing to Hitler footage.  Here it is.  It's our boys come home. 
[00:54:30]  Oh, yeah.  Propaganda films.  And now we look at the celebration in Times Square.  As the victory in Europe is sweeping the nation.  Look at that.  A sailor kissing a nurse.  What the hell did they give them?  I don't know.  I can only hear the music on the left side.  Yeah, I don't know.  The whole place is falling apart.  All right.  Now for the latest on the Virginia Tech massacre. 
[00:55:00]  Wounded students got a much-needed morale boost thanks to some welcome visitors.  Hitler is dead.  How did the Fuhrer meet his end?  By his own hand.  By his own hand.  You might as well do like...  80.  Humphrey Bogart or Charlie Chaplin.  Here we go.  Now for the latest on the Virginia Tech massacre.  Wounded students got a much-needed morale boost thanks to some welcome visitors. 
[00:55:30]  Here are some boys taking a break watching the new movie Casablanca and smoking Lucky Strike cigarettes.  World War II footage.  Damn, Jimmy.  That was their gift.  Old newsreels.  Thanks?  What the hell is this?  This is the best you can do for us?  A marching band?  What the hell?  And here comes the Hindenburg. 
[00:56:00]  Bound for Lakehurst, New Jersey.  Ready to touch down.  There goes the cables.  As the crew...  Oh, no!  Oh, it's bursting in flames!  Get out of the way!  Oh, get out of the way!  Oh, humanity!  Oh, ho, ho!  I'm fired.  I have to go to satellite radio.  Can't cry on the air?  Insensitive to a Nazi blimp?  I did what?  One of you cities will not get to hear this come Monday. 
[00:56:30]  Maybe it's a good thing.  Now for the latest on the Virginia Tech massacre.  Wounded students got a much-needed morale boost thanks to some welcome visitors.  The Japs had a dastardly attack on Pearl Harbor.  We'll pay them back, boys.  Dastardly is a great word.  They stopped using.  Sometime after there was two-to-one water fountain conversion, 
[00:57:00]  they stopped using dastardly.  The Jerry's on the run in Africa.  Rommel and his boys just got a little taste of the Allies.  They won't be back.  Hey, they're showing the Empire State Building on TV.  You might be able to work that into it.  A little entertainment news.  Brand new building in Manhattan, the Empire State Building.  For sure, it will be the biggest building in the world for centuries to come. 
[00:57:30]  To Mr. and Mrs. America and all the ships at sea,  I submit you a good night.  All right, here's the latest.  Now for the latest on the Virginia Tech massacre.  Wounded students got a much-needed morale boost thanks to some welcome visitors.  No, you can't listen to it. 
[00:58:00]  No.  Awful music.  The Hokies marching band played outside their hospital windows yesterday.  Some students waved back.  And there's more outrage.  Throw my bedpan at them.  Video rant being repeatedly aired in the media.  Relatives of the victims have canceled appearances on NBC's Today show.  Bravo.  As South Koreans held a vigil,  their U.S. ambassador says Cho's parents are being moved every day for their safety.  Cho's former classmates say the killer was bullied in high school with kids saying, 
[00:58:30]  quote,  go back to China, unquote.  They say he may even have kept a death list.  God, we all were bullied in school.  Just about every one of us.  And let me say the NBC thing.  I don't think,  I think it's very sad that the victims' families are feeling awful.  I don't think the victims' families being sad is called to not talk about news and not show certain things.  I don't think that's the issue here.  The issue is it's been proven,  proven that these things spawn copycats. 
[00:59:00]  And knowing that,  they still showed it.  They know they're contributing to other people being shot,  and they didn't care.  They don't care.  It's all about the ladies.  It's not about the victims' families,  which is sad,  but look,  that's the way it is.  The news has to be reported.  They tried covering their asses too last night.  Yeah, we'll get into that in a second,  but we got a phone call with the junkies.  Oh, we got the junkies.  They're doing their show live in Washington, D.C.  I don't know if we're going to connect or what, but...  Are we going to connect or what?  Are we going to connect or what?  What? 
[00:59:30]  Are the boys on?  All right, let's go to O&A and get them on.  I know they're on a commercial break now.  Guys!  No, we're just hanging out.  We're live.  You're live.  We've been wanting to talk to you guys for a very long time,  the junkies down there in Washington, D.C.  What's up, guys?  Hey, what's up, buddy?  How are you, man?  It's cool to talk to you guys, man.  How are you guys doing?  Hey, thanks for helping.  This is Norton.  Thanks for helping me out.  They were helping me with HBO tickets and stuff.  They've been good friends to us down there.  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  We're big fans, man.  We love what you guys do.  Thank you.  Thank you, sirs.  And we all love paying Bob Eatman outrageous sums of money every month. 
[01:00:00]  We share an agent, don't we?  Yeah, super agent Bob Eatman's got the junkies, too.  Don't you love those phone calls?  Yeah.  Guys, we call him gloom and doom Bob.  It's just like every time he calls, it's just, oh, guys, we got to do this.  And I was talking to this one, and, oh, geez, it just doesn't look good.  It's this and that.  Well, we're going to lose one of our cities, and it's not Washington.  We could throw that out there.  One of the cities goes away after today, and Bob calls us, and doom and gloom Bob's like,  we just got to hope that this doesn't start a chain reaction. 
[01:00:30]  Oh, guys, because I got college funds for kids that I need to pay for and a mortgage.  We don't want you guys going back to Worcester.  I got a wife that's way out of my league, that if I'm not making money, she'll leave me in a second.  You did not say that.  Have you ever met his brother, Roth?  Oh, yeah, it's Evil Bob.  We call him Evil Bob.  He was the priest in Taxi who helped Lotka get married. 
[01:01:00]  Right.  That cadaver.  Right.  We call him Billy Ripken because Bob's cat.  He's a minor league.  Minor league Bob?  Yeah.  We just go with Evil Bob because he grows that goatee like they used to do in sitcoms.  I like how he taught Patrick Swayze how to move things in Ghost.  We had a meeting with ESPN.  It was like a big meeting.  We had a meeting with ESPN, and in the middle of the meeting, Billy Ripken left because he had to get home to his wife. 
[01:01:30]  They'd just leave you there.  He just left you there?  He just left us there.  Left us there.  And the guys there, like Mark Shapiro, some of the big guys at ESPN at the time, goes,  Did your agent just leave and then let us just roll out because his wife had a surprise party?  Excuse me.  This is kind of important.  It's not like it was a big meeting or anything.  It's only ESPN.  All right.  Well, listen.  We want to promote this for you guys.  It's ONA's traveling virus.  It's just brilliant.  You've got a great lineup here.  Carlos Mateo, Jim Norton, Bob Saget, Louis C.K., Rich Voss.  You guys have been doing this for a while. 
[01:02:00]  It's been a home run, right?  Yeah.  Last year was great, man.  Last year we brought it to America, but before that we kind of, yeah, did it kind of locally in New York here and there.  We did four cities last year, right?  Yeah, four.  And D.C., unfortunately, was not one of them, so we wanted to get down there this year.  And we did a pre-sale yesterday.  It went really well.  Extremely well, yeah.  We're very excited to get to D.C. finally and do a major show there.  No, no.  It's cool, man.  And you guys finally, like, Norton's out there grinding, doing a whole set.  And ONA, are you guys just going up there saying hello to the crowd and then still clocking a nice check? 
[01:02:30]  Oh, it's so easy, Jim.  All right, man.  Don't blow up our spot, all right?  We do have the same agent.  I'll get you the same deal someday.  Just drinking.  Backstage, and then you get to pop out and wave, and then you're back to your beers.  And it's not even Opie and Anthony.  It's Eric and Nathaniel in nicer clothing.  Yeah, we're home.  We're home in our mansions.  It's someone else out on stage looking like us.  Sun doubles.  That's fantastic.  Yeah, we're like Gallagher twos we get out there.  It depends on the city.  Some cities we do a lot of time.  In other cities, it's, you know, we're introing videos and comedians. 
[01:03:00]  I don't know.  So in Cleveland, we actually tried to find the fattest girl in the audience, and we paid  her off in front of everybody.  That was hilarious.  All right.  So we do a little something in every city.  We make videos backstage, and it's very interactive.  Listen, I want to tell you guys, you guys were all over the two big stories, obviously,  in the last couple of weeks.  The Virginia Tech disaster and the IMIS thing.  And you guys were all over both of them.  You're right on with the IMIS deal.  They just totally served them up.  I hate the way the media did.  Yep.  One of their own. 
[01:03:30]  That was just awful.  And now with the Virginia Tech thing, you guys are all over the way.  NBC just whored themselves out and glorified this guy.  Just home run with both those issues there.  Hey, thanks, man.  Thank you, man.  Thank you.  Well, one city didn't think it was a home run.  No.  One city thought that we'd just been lame for a really long time.  I didn't pay attention to the last two weeks where we really upped our game  and decided this would be a perfect time just to drop the show.  So thank you, junkies.  We all know radio is just filled with a bunch of geniuses at the top.  We all know that.  That's why they're there. 
[01:04:00]  We don't know any better.  Right.  All right, fellas.  Well, the tickets go on sale, I guess, at 10 o'clock today.  For DC, yes.  Cool, man.  Thank you, guys, man.  We really appreciate you helping us out.  It's appreciated.  Anytime.  And I know it's awkward because the times are sort of conflicting,  but we want you guys to come down to DC and hang out.  We will.  We're going to do a whole thing when we get down to DC.  So how's Donna, Mike, and the rest of the guys doing down there?  Yeah, everybody's cool.  Everybody's cool.  All right.  Very good, man.  Thanks a lot.  Thanks, guys.  Appreciate it.  We appreciate it.  All right.  No worries.  See you guys in August.  All right.  Cool.  There they go.  The junkies doing their show right now as we speak on WJFK in Washington. 
[01:04:30]  Yeah, they're live, and we are in tape delay after them.  I think it's between them and Donna and Mike.  Yeah, absolutely.  So the tickets go on sale in Washington at 10 a.m.?  9 a.m. everywhere else, but at 10 a.m. in DC.  Go to Ticketmaster.com.  Go to our MySpace page, Opie and Anthony, and you'll get all the info,  all the lineups, and all that stuff.  And the reason it's on sale at 10 o'clock in DC and not 9 is because there's a  federal law because it's not technically a state preventing anything.  It kind of bleeds in from the day before. 
[01:05:00]  You're not allowed to sell a certain thing online before 10 o'clock in the morning.  Federal law?  Yeah.  Stop.  I made that up.  Okay.  You know something?  I just looked at Jimmy, and I was looking at him like, what?  I didn't know this.  And I know Jimmy does a lot of things selling tickets because he's a comic.  And I thought he knew something.  And then I saw his little smirk.  I couldn't help it.  I just realized that I almost sounded like I knew what I was talking about.  You did.  And it was dreck.  You can fake it very well. 
[01:05:30]  Hey, do we have time to do the Alec Baldwin thing?  We got a couple more minutes, right?  We started the show with this.  It was out of phase or something.  TMZ.com was very smart.  They got this unbelievable audio.  They're going to get sued like crazy.  You think?  Everyone's playing it today.  But we finally figured out all the news stations had no idea this was out of phase.  So it was really, really low.  We fixed it so you could hear it much better.  Yes, Jimmy?  Will they get sued for that?  Because it was released.  I mean, how does Kim Basinger release that? 
[01:06:00]  That's awful.  Unless she's sick of him being portrayed as a nice guy and a big star and like, this is  who this guy really is.  And knock him down a couple of matches.  That humiliates the daughter, man.  Doesn't that make her look like everyone in school knows how her father talks to her or  whatever?  That's just kind of a bad idea.  They're going to call her little pig.  Little piggy.  It'll be 18, 19.  Her boyfriend will bring this one back.  Well, yeah.  You know what, Jimmy?  I mean, I think I might see it your way after all because all you needed to do is give this  to a judge to get what she got done, which is the visiting rights have been taken away 
[01:06:30]  temporarily, but to throw it out there in the public, yeah, you're kind of right.  You've got to feel bad for the kid.  Like, he's going off on her like the ex-wife.  Maybe we should be responsible not playing.  You know, this might make other father celebrities.  She's being called a pig by her father.  We've got to be responsible broadcasters.  Wait a minute.  Jimmy's right.  Hit the play button.  A lot of these kids are much older than you think.  All right.  Here's Alec Baldwin leaving a voicemail for his little girl. 
[01:07:00]  Princess.  Yeah.  Daddy's little girl.  Isn't that awful?  This is him from Glen Gary, Glen Ross.  Yeah.  Let's be Steve Kappas.  You know, we took it into consideration that maybe we shouldn't play this.  We struggled with this decision for at least five minutes this morning.  It might make other celebrity fathers that are estranged from the wives with 11-year-old daughters yell at them on the phone answering machine. 
[01:07:30]  We know this.  After careful consideration, we have decided that this is too good and it'll make us bigger stars than we are.  Right, Steve Kappas?  We're on the same page, right?  We know what you meant.  Hey, I want to tell you something, okay?  And I want to leave a message for you right now.  Sounds better.  Again, it's 10.30 here in New York on a Wednesday.  And once again, I've made an ass of myself trying to get you a phone to call you at a specific time. 
[01:08:00]  When the time comes for me to make the phone call, I stop whatever I'm doing and I go and I make that phone call at 11 o'clock in the morning in New York and if you don't pick up the phone at 10 o'clock at night and you don't even have that goddamn phone turned on, I want you to know something, okay?  I'm tired of playing this game with you.  I'm leaving this message with you to tell you, you have insulted me for the last time.  You have insulted me.  You don't have the brains or the decency as a human being. 
[01:08:30]  I don't give a damn that you're 12 years old or 11 years old or that you're a child or that your mother is a thoughtless pain in the ass who doesn't care about what you do as far as I'm concerned.  You have humiliated me for the last time with this phone and when I come out there next week, I'm going to fly out there for the day just to straighten you out on this issue.  I'm going to let you know just how disappointed in you I am and how angry I am with you that you've done this to me again. 
[01:09:00]  You've made me feel like a fool and you've made me feel like a fool over and over and over again.  And this crap you pull on me with this goddamn phone situation that you would never dream of doing to your mother and you do it to me constantly and over and over again.  I am going to get on a plane or I'm going to come out there for the day and I'm going to straighten your ass out when I see you. 
[01:09:30]  Do you understand me?  I'm going to really make sure you get it that I'm going to get on a plane, I'm going to turn around, and I'm going to come home.  So you better be ready Friday the 20th to meet with me.  So I'm going to let you know just how I feel about what a rude little pig you really are.  You are a rude, thoughtless little pig.  Okay?  To replay this mess.  You might be a little confused.  It sounds like he's talking to his ex-wife, but no, that's his 11- or 12-year-old daughter. 
[01:10:00]  He is just, like Chris Rock said, you know, he's putting her right on the pole.  He's driving her to the pole.  She will be on that pole, wrapping her leg around it, taking dollar bills from guys.  And we want to thank TMZ.com.  It was funny, this voicemail hit yesterday afternoon, and Roland emailed us like he has this massive exclusive,  and he has all these rules, and you can play it, and they're going to allow you to play it if you plug TMZ.com, right? 
[01:10:30]  We all got the emails.  They were long-winded at all.  I'm like, wow, Roland, really getting something done.  I heard it five times before I even sat at my desk at 5 a.m. this morning.  Like, every news station, 1010 Winds, it was everywhere.  It's on two channels as you're talking.  Yeah, right, exactly.  And I'm thinking, wow, Roland, no, everyone got this one.  We like when we get that little nugget that no one else gets. 
[01:11:00]  It's already on my ringtone.  I mean, it's just everywhere.  Well, we have exclusive audio that they don't even have from his phone call.  What's your name, fat body?  Do your parents have any children that live?  Sir, yes, sir.  Why, you little maggots, you make me want to vomit.  What is that private pile?  Sir, Jelly Donuts, sir.  That was, daughter has a deep voice.  Yeah, a little bit, a little bit.  Sounds like a fat soldier. 
[01:11:30]  But I am, I'm siding with Alec on this one.  I think the one error he made, I'm going to straighten your ass out.  To me, it really sounds like a good talking to.  That doesn't sound like he's going to care.  No, not a threat, but the lawyer for her will play it up as a threat.  I really think that means he's just going to chew her ass out, kind of, because he doesn't  threaten to hit her at all.  No.  And it's the way you're always afraid when your father gets home, but calling her a little  pig is what did him in.  That last line.  That's bad.  Yeah, he should have said to her, like, you are a silly goose.  Right.  At least he didn't say anything about nappy hair. 
[01:12:00]  That's right.  Or anything about her promiscuity.  Absolutely.  Thank God he didn't mention her ethnicity, which is also his.  Right.  There you go.  All right.  We've got to take a break.  Very, very busy morning.  And once again, we've been saying it all morning.  One of the cities that is listening to us right now will not hear the Opie and Anthony  show starting Monday.  We're losing one of our cities.  And so far, we told New York to sit down.  We're doing it like American Idol style.  And of course, we just talked to the junkies down there in Washington, D.C. 
[01:12:30]  If you're listening to us on WJFK, you can also sit down.  You're safe.  You will hear us come Monday.  You are safe.  Mike in Boston, what's going on?  Hey, what's going on, ONA?  Hey, Mike.  I'm hoping it's not true that it's Boston, but I'm hoping it's a little bit of a trick  question because they're saying you guys are going to be on vacation for two weeks.  And let's put those two morons, Toucher and Rich, on while you guys aren't there for two  weeks.  Because this means they've got to move to New York. 
[01:13:00]  Well, no.  Boston's safe, too.  But they're doing something really weird when we go on vacation that I've got to be honest.  I completely don't agree with.  The PD's been trying to talk to me, and I just can't talk to them about it.  I don't even know their show.  It's not even about Toucher and Rich and what they do on WBCN, but they decided to move  them to mornings for two weeks.  And if you know anything about radio that just doesn't make sense, that messes up all  the listening habits of people.  It doesn't make sense. 
[01:13:30]  People want to hear our voices, whether it's a best of or live.  But he has control of his station, so he's going to do what he has to do.  But I think it's a really, really stupid move, and I don't think it has anything to  do with the talent of Toucher and Rich.  I think, personally, it's more of a kind of a thing of we're doing something he does that  he's annoyed at, and he's showing us that he's annoyed at it.  That really is like saying you guys are replaceable.  So if you want to screw around, you are expendable. 
[01:14:00]  It's weird.  We haven't taken a vacation since last August.  That's the fact.  Yeah.  You know, we took a little time off around Christmas, but we had to fly out to do Leno.  We had to go to Vegas for the company, and then we took the normal kind of Christmas  time off.  Unfortunately, our vacation this time around falls within what's called the spring book,  and that makes a lot of people nervous.  There's nothing we can do about it, and a bunch of the stations are panicking, and BCN  panicked to the point where we're not even going to be on in mornings for two weeks. 
[01:14:30]  Just relax.  And it's going to be touch and rich.  And like I said, those guys have always been cool to us.  I don't know their show, but it just doesn't make sense.  It doesn't.  And I can explain why.  I can get into the ABCs of radio to tell you why it doesn't make sense, but whatever.  But you'd be bored crapless.  Absolutely.  So Boston is safe.  Boston, man.  All right.  Thank you, Mike.  We got Drew Boogie in the studio.  Drew, get us out of here for a while.  It's opium.  Why do we scream at each other? 
[01:15:00]  This is what it sounds like when the dogs cry.  We're out of here for a while. 
[01:15:30]  You're checking out the Opie and Anthony show, the ONA virus spreading across America. 
[01:16:00]  After today, we say goodbye to one of our cities, unfortunately.  It's too bad, too, because I really like the city personally.  We're enraged right now.  Not about the losing of a city.  We just know that's part of the game when you syndicate a radio show.  You gain markets.  You lose markets.  We lost Columbus about a month, month and a half ago.  I don't know, a couple months ago. 
[01:16:30]  But since then, we've gained a bunch of other cities.  We're going to lose this other city today.  But they're already working on a couple of Imus' stations that want us.  So it's just part of the game, and it sucks.  But I think this city is going to have a lot of disappointed ONA fans.  Just remember, we'll be on XM Satellite Radio.  That will be a way to continue listening to the show if you're a hardcore listener.  But that's not what we're really pissed off about.  There's a guy just trying to invent the next Imus situation.  Trying to stir things up. 
[01:17:00]  And he has thrown us right in the middle of it.  He's pointing to us.  He's pointing to Michael Savage, Rush Limbaugh, and Neil Bortz.  It's amazing that he's a Times writer, and yet he's going after Savage and Bortz and Limbaugh.  Yeah.  Hmm.  Interesting.  And us.  The article starts with us.  We did our reenactment of this weirdo's play, Richard McBeef, that everyone kind of saw all over the Internet.  We played it out on the air. 
[01:17:30]  And this guy's completely, completely taking it out of context.  This is such a biased article, even where we're concerned.  I don't know about these other guys, radio guys.  I don't know what they did.  I don't know what the context was.  But based on what I know that we did, and Jacques Steinberg's take on the whole thing, the guy is irresponsible as a journalist.  He did not check the facts, the audio. 
[01:18:00]  I don't even know if he listened to it.  But based on his story, I don't see – see, he's trying too hard to make something of it.  So what you do, if you're in the news, you leave little things out.  You put little things in and hope it snowballs and hope it picks up momentum.  Is that what you're trying to do, Jacques?  You want to try to hang us out to dry?  Well, the hot thing to do these days is to go after edgy talk show hosts.  And that's not like – I'm not only talking about Jacques Jocks. 
[01:18:30]  I'm talking about political talk show hosts.  Everybody.  Everybody.  Yeah.  Because this is the thing now.  It's the big thing to do now.  I heard that Reverend Al and Jesse, they're on to their next target.  Some DJ that I don't even know in Atlanta.  I think they're heading down there to try to get him fired.  Another white DJ?  Honestly, I don't know all the details.  I mean, maybe I could get the details.  So this is the new in thing to do.  And Jacques Steinberg is just doing some unbelievable, irresponsible journalism. 
[01:19:00]  And unfortunately, it's not some dopey paper that no one reads.  It's the New York Times.  So it's getting attention.  And we're not going to allow the media frenzy to completely destroy this show.  No, not from this douche.  Yeah, here's the line that bugs me the most.  They try to extract humor from the massacre at Virginia Tech, like we're trying to make light of the situation, the massacre situation. 
[01:19:30]  Instead of saying what we did, we're making light of this jerk-off that did this.  Instead of presenting him like the media did Jacques, like a super action hero poster, and playing his video ad nauseum on every single news channel.  Why don't you go after them?  Why the hell can't they eat their own and write about how awful it was that they played that guy's video over and over and over again? 
[01:20:00]  And just crapped all over the victims, crapped all over the victims' family by rubbing salt in the wounds of playing that video over and over again.  Instead of saying that we were trying to extract humor from the massacre.  Instead of what we were doing, which is extracting humor from the screenplay or play that this show kid wrote. 
[01:20:30]  He was a douchebag and a bad writer.  An awful writer.  And an English major.  Yeah.  And that was the way he conveyed thought.  It was childlike and irritating.  And you're a lazy journalist.  Lazy.  And you're trying to go after something because you probably heard a quote about it.  You're not doing your job, stupid.  You're trying to make something that isn't there.  Do your job, Jacques.  We took this guy and presented him as the little douchebag that he was instead of an action hero and hero to every lunatic that wants to go out there and make a name for himself. 
[01:21:00]  We spent the entire show yesterday going after NBC and MSNBC and then the rest of the media for playing this stupid video manifesto.  We did our entire show on that.  You find me one time during this whole episode when this first happened, find me one instance where we hit the air and made light of any of the victims or the horror of what happened.  You find me one instance, you lying sack of crap. 
[01:21:30]  Find me one instance where we made light of the victims that were killed in Virginia.  I defy you.  You will find us making fun of the murderer because apparently the news isn't doing it.  They're lining him up as a hero.  Find me one instance.  Don't editorialize on something like a radio show.  It's amazing how the news will come back and they'll say something about I miss or this show and go, ah, those guys must have good parents. 
[01:22:00]  But yet when it's a scumbag like this kid, they show it and go, ah, it's pretty heavy stuff.  Manifesto.  Calling it a manifesto.  It's a rambling excuse for a MySpace page.  You glorified a weirdo.  And you knowingly, you knowingly NBC contributed to copycats.  And you even gave those little disclaimers.  When does the media ever give disclaimers on giving information when it's one for a kid?  They did that to cover their own ass.  You know what amazes me about this New York Times article? 
[01:22:30]  We're getting nothing but praise as far as how we handled this whole situation.  Not to pat our own backs, but now we have to kind of bring this to the table as well.  People are ranting and raving saying, wow, you guys really, really did us proud how you handled this whole situation this week.  And this crap has to come out.  And the article starts off with what we did with the Richard McBeath play.  It's just unbelievable.  And we got calls into the New York Times.  We got calls into Jacques Steinberg. 
[01:23:00]  We got his cell phone, his office number.  We got someone that answered his phone at the New York Times.  And they said he's going to be in at 730.  So we know he's there.  So give us a call and let's discuss this.  Come on.  Get on the phone.  Get on the phone.  And not for an apology.  That's for sure.  Unless it's you apologizing to us.  And you'll be given a chance to talk.  No one's going to jump all over you.  No.  You will.  Every time we get a reporter on the phone, we let him talk.  It's not like we attack them.  But he won't.  These guys, they don't want to deal with anybody honestly.  What kind of a journalist would do a story about people and then not want to talk to those people and get their take on it? 
[01:23:30]  Like a journalist that knows that he's printing a biased article that's leaving details out so he can fulfill his own agenda, which is trying to create the next on-air radio controversy.  That's what he's doing here.  It's self-serving, you scumbag.  You're a self-serving scumbag. 
[01:24:00]  He went after Rush.  He goes after Savage, Neil Bortz, and us.  I don't know enough about Neil Bortz's show, but I'm going to take it.  He's fairly conservative.  Am I correct about that?  People said that Anthony would love the guy.  Okay.  Yeah.  So, what a shock.  What a shock.  Neil Bortz, I can't get past the name.  You might have to hang out with Neil Bortz for a few beers.  But, you know, enough with these media frenzies.  Someone has got to put a stop to the media frenzy.  There you go.  Covered the New York Times yesterday.  Front page.  The picture of the shooter with his arms out. 
[01:24:30]  There you go.  You sons of bitches.  Why don't you go after your own paper?  Why don't you go after your own paper?  Jacques, you'd be let go by the end of today if you did.  That is nothing but sensationalism.  It's the picture.  It's the most ominous picture that was included in the still photographs that this idiot sent to NBC.  It's him with the two guns in his hand, the vest.  It's how he was dressed when he went out and killed these people. 
[01:25:00]  And it is on the front page of the New York Times.  Both guns out.  With the big NBC News logo on there.  God forbid that was off.  You wouldn't want to get sued for using it without permission.  And that's on your front page.  It's an action movie.  It's a John Woo movie poster.  You're glorifying this guy.  What we did was took his dopey play, Richard McBeef, and read it.  And read the play. 
[01:25:30]  And acted it out in comedic, satirical fashion.  And made fun of what a little nothing this kid was.  A loser.  Not portraying him as a hero like the press is.  Trying to, let's get into the mind of a murderer.  What was he thinking?  What drove him to this?  Look at the picture.  Look at the video.  Listen to his voice.  Oh my God.  We have to play this so we can learn more.  It's not about learning.  Be honest with yourselves.  You were doing this to get people to buy your newspaper. 
[01:26:00]  New York Times puts the big picture up so people pass by and go,  Oh my God.  Look at this frightening picture.  Let me buy the paper.  And we were outraged from very early yesterday.  We were way ahead of this because now all the papers are talking about how wrong it was for MSNBC and NBC to air the video manifesto.  We were on it all day yesterday.  Beyond pissed off about it.  And again, find me one instance where there was an ounce of disrespect to the victims of their family coming out of this program. 
[01:26:30]  You find me one instant, you jackass.  Just a stupid, lazy reporter who doesn't seem to want to do his job properly.  Do your research.  This is self-serving.  He's trying to propel himself into the next situation that involves on-air personalities.  Because from what I hear, he was flag-waving for the whole time about the IMIS situation to try to get him thrown off the air.  Trying to hop on that bandwagon.  Wait, you're trying to spearhead this one now?  So you figure you'd throw a few jocks' names in the paper that are related to their comments on the Virginia Tech shooting. 
[01:27:00]  Regardless of context or what it was.  You know, you make me sick.  Look at that.  And I love this.  A picture of the New York Times front page.  Right there.  Double guns.  Huge picture of a show with the friggin' two guns out.  Good enough for your paper.  That right there is more damaging than anything I've heard on the radio. 
[01:27:30]  And he's like trying to extract some humor.  Why don't you write the New York Times was trying to extract some sales.  Some sales.  By sensationalizing this kid's photo and empowering him in the country's eyes, which is exactly what he wanted.  You did exactly what he wanted.  You know what?  We really should get ahead of this and immediately throw up all the audio clips of our outrage right on our website for the media.  Right on our website for the media. 
[01:28:00]  Let's say hi to Jen in Jersey.  What's up?  Makes me sick.  Hey, guys.  How you doing?  Good, Jen.  I'm a VT alum, and I wanted to ask for your help.  Sure.  We're pretty outraged at the media and the vultures that they are.  Thank God you guys came out against the media like this because I noticed yesterday, early on, when the video first started making the rounds,  all the TV stations and the websites, CNN, Fox News' website, MSNBC's website, all had front and center the big shooter picture of the action hero that massacred these students on their front pages. 
[01:28:30]  And then as the heat got turned up and a lot of the people from VT started really getting pissed off, the websites took down the pictures and CNN started doing it where every time you clicked on their site, it was a new victim was up on their front page.  And that was done sheerly out of self-preservation.  They knew that they were starting to catch some heat and had to turn it around. 
[01:29:00]  What kind of help do you need?  Yeah, what do you need there, Jen?  We have a petition going against the media to ask them to stop trying to blame our president and our chief of police for not reacting  and to take the pictures and the videos off the TV so we can start healing.  And I was wondering if I could give you guys the website and you could put it on your website so people can go sign it and tell them to please just get out of our town and leave us alone.  Get out of our town. 
[01:29:30]  Hey, Jen, you came to the right place.  One thing I can say about our audience, they have a lot of passion for this radio show.  I know.  And they step up when it really means something.  So give out the website.  Of course, all the O&A pests pay close attention.  And let's help out Jen here.  Go ahead, Jen.  Okay.  It's www.wesupportvt.com.  www.wesupportvt.com.  Yes.  You guys do realize they're just flat out using you guys for ratings, right, for their news programs. 
[01:30:00]  Oh, yeah.  How sick is it?  Like they're just trolling around like roaches.  They're running around that campus looking to shove a mic into anyone's face they can.  Just leave.  You're right.  You know, enough time has gone by.  Obviously, it was a news story, so they're all going to show up.  But then the ones that do their show from the location, they're still – how many boom trucks are still out there?  With the – you know, and the reporters running around looking for anyone shedding a tear or that they could shove a camera in their face. 
[01:30:30]  They're despicable.  And Jacques Steinberg thinking he's going after a very easy target.  He can't take on that.  That's some major heavy lifting that would get him fired.  So go after the easy target, maybe some edgy stuff, some jocks did across America to try to, you know, create the next Imus situation.  We're not going to have any of that.  No.  Good luck.  None of that.  All right.  So we'll get the website out.  It's a petition to get the vultures with network insignias on their sleeves out of the town. 
[01:31:00]  It's WeSupportVT.com.  Yes.  Okay.  Thank you, guys.  And thanks to all the VT students who every time they're interviewed, they won't take the bait.  All right.  And they support our school.  So thank you.  All right.  Good.  Bye.  Take care.  Hang in there.  Thanks.  VT alumni there.  Just trying to get something going.  Just trying to be the next guy that spearheads a witch hunt. 
[01:31:30]  And he won't come on the phone?  Not for you.  Come on the phone.  We've called him.  Come on the phone.  Don't be a pussy.  Get on the phone.  For God's sake.  Where's Steve?  We got an update on Jacques Steinberg.  I want to talk to this guy.  We've called him all morning.  All morning.  And what's happening?  They said that he would be in at 730.  Why would a journalist who does a story about a radio show and then can get direct commentary?  What kind of reporter doesn't want to talk to the people he's doing?  Not only that.  How about it's his big story for today? 
[01:32:00]  It's in today's paper.  This isn't yesterday or something.  And the first three words of his article are Opie and Anthony.  And now he's getting calls from Opie and Anthony wanting to talk to him.  And he's not calling back?  Nope.  Why?  I don't know.  But I actually got a human being on the phone about a half an hour ago who said he'd be back at 730.  Well, if he doesn't call, that speaks volumes.  Speaks volumes.  Call him again, Steve.  What's the matter?  Don't want to trip over your own pen? 
[01:32:30]  You dope?  Because he knows.  He knows damn well what will happen if he calls us.  He'll look like the jerk-off, inaccurate writer that he is.  They are only empowered.  They're never empowered one-on-one when you're talking about something.  They're only empowered when they have a little screen in front of them.  And they can completely control all content.  They have no ability to do it at any discussion.  You know better, Jacques, than a message board lurker. 
[01:33:00]  Than a message board troll creep that can just sit there and type whatever they want without any accountability or repercussions or nothing.  What about your repercussions for what you say or print?  Huh?  How about that?  How about confronting the people you wrote about?  Hmm?  How about that?  We're waiting.  We're waiting.  We're here.  This is no way to do a radio show.  It's unbelievable.  You can't. 
[01:33:30]  We have a bullseye on our foreheads.  I refuse to do a show.  A bullseye.  We've got guys out there that are just trying to create the next media frenzy over nothing.  And the problem is no one is going to even listen that it was nothing.  They just take what the New York Times says for their word.  And that's it.  That's how it works.  I ain't going down like that.  And I'm not going to sit here and do a show with this cloud of fear over our heads.  It ain't going to happen.  We'll either nip it in the bud and defend ourselves or they could just throw us off. 
[01:34:00]  Whatever happens.  But I'm not going to sit here and not do a show that we want to do because there's this cloud of fear.  It's like the McCarthy hearings.  It is like the goddamn McCarthy hearings where you're afraid to be labeled a communist.  Now you're afraid to be labeled what?  Insensitive?  Is that it?  Now you get a label of insensitivity and it's like the 50s where you get the label of being a communist. 
[01:34:30]  And anyone can say it without proof or with any minimal scrap of anything they could come up with.  And then you're blackballed.  It's just gotten ridiculous.  Fight back.  Just fight back.  No one fought back for Imus.  They just caved in and collapsed.  Yeah.  And we're not going down that way.  No effing way.  We got Rob Bartlett calling in.  Look, we'll give you a great interview.  The New York Times will give you a great interview. 
[01:35:00]  Come on.  You could have a great follow-up for tomorrow on your story.  But why would you want to find out that we're actually beyond intelligent and know what we're doing with this radio show?  Why wouldn't you?  And know what we're doing with this very important story that hit everybody.  Why wouldn't you want to talk to the two people who you first mentioned in your article?  It's the first words of your big article of the day covering this.  And you don't want to talk to those two people?  You were obviously proud by showing your family and friends.  Look what I did.  Look what I did.  This is going to get me some attention. 
[01:35:30]  Bunch of douches.  Get off the phone, you small little man.  You disgust me.  You disgust me, Jacques Steinberg.  Pre-sale tickets, Jimmy.  I know it's completely...  Hey, pre-sale.  Come on.  The big show coming up, Virus Tour.  Completely thrown in reverse, I understand.  Let's acknowledge that.  But it's very important.  Tickets go on sale for all our ONA Traveling Virus Comedy tour dates today at 9 a.m.  through Ticketmaster.  D.C. is at 10, but everyone else, 9 a.m.  Yeah, D.C. is one of the markets. 
[01:36:00]  We have Stephen Lynch is confirmed in Jones Beach.  We also have Carlos Mencia confirmed in Washington, D.C., Detroit, Michigan, and in Boston, Massachusetts.  And we are also doing the PNC.  We're doing Camden again.  We're doing D.C. for the first time and Detroit for the first time.  And we're doing Mohegan Sun for the first time.  So it's going to be a great tour.  9 a.m.  Tickets go on sale at Ticketmaster.  The pre-sale tickets were just unbelievable how fast they went. 
[01:36:30]  So, yeah, all right, make sure you get your tickets sometime today or over the weekend, okay?  We've got Drew Boogie in studio.  He's doing a little this, a little that for us in and out of breaks.  This is live, Drew Boogie.  Opie and Anthony.  This is live, Drew Boogie. 
[01:37:00]  And pick up the phone.  Hot, hot, hot, hot.  Put your house up for Detroit.  I love this city.  You're checking out the Opie and Anthony show. 
[01:37:30]  We've got Drew Boogie live in studio doing that just on the fly for everybody.  We are so fired up once again today.  We've been fired up for a while now on this radio show, especially the last two weeks.  And one city decided this is the perfect time to take us off the air, which just amazes me. 
[01:38:00]  Just amazes me.  It just shows how stupid this business really is in the end.  We've got to say good morning to Bob Saget, a good friend of the program.  He's sitting right next to me here.  Good morning.  Thank you for having me.  And Bob's playing.  And I used to know it as the Westbury Music Fair, but now it's the North Fork.  North Fork.  Why does everything have to be named after a bank now?  Everything needs a bank name.  I think they found, is that a bank thing?  I thought it was like looking for water.  Or Morgan.  Yeah.  We found it with our North Fork.  North Fork Bank. 
[01:38:30]  Whatchamacallit, last night, the Red Bank thing, the Count Basie Theater, the one where Springsteen  goes all the time.  Nice.  It's amazing.  And they're all screaming out your names and stuff.  It's a great gig, man.  Really?  Yeah.  One guy wrote it with a Sharpie pen on his unit.  It was awesome.  Oh, great.  I wouldn't have seen it had it not accidentally fallen off the stage into his lap.  One of our listeners, did he have to pull his belly up so you could see it?  He wasn't Asian, was he?  He just put his own old.  He actually read some of his play that he'd written.  He was very talented.  Yes.  Very talented playwright.  If he was a black guy, it would be everybody associated with the show, and Tom Chiasano, 
[01:39:00]  and all the affiliates.  It just would go on and on and on.  Sure.  Actually, I think the article is fairly positive.  You get mentioned up front.  That's what you're publishing on.  The New York Times?  Yeah.  They say you're up front.  Yeah, we're right there.  It's not really a panning thing.  This guy Jacques is probably at home going, I thought they'd like it.  What did I do?  I don't understand.  I wrote a positive piece on the guy.  Let me tell you in the article, and I like that it was like a quote by a no one.  It's a, one of the participants can be heard saying, it's like, with him. 
[01:39:30]  Well, that just goes to show that he kind of doesn't know the show.  He doesn't know who it is, even if he heard it or somebody told him about it.  Yeah.  He doesn't know who did what.  And Bob, we don't know much, but we know this.  If the New York Times starts liking us, we're in deep trouble.  Yeah.  We're in deep, deep trouble.  And you're saying it's no big deal.  We've got a guy on the phone that could show you how this type of thing is a really big deal.  Yeah.  We've got a good...  Our pal.  Our pal, a good friend of ours, Rob Bartlett.  He used to work on Imus' radio show. 
[01:40:00]  Yep.  He's a funny man, Rob Bartlett.  Oh, yeah.  I don't care if you're 11 years old.  You're a thoughtless little pig.  Sorry, I'm just getting the kids off the school.  Morning, O.  Great first impression.  Hey there, Rob.  How you doing, man?  You heard the Alec Baldwin voicemail, right, Bob?  No.  Oh, we've got something to play for you before we get out of here.  He could teach you some parenting skills.  Yes.  Yes.  But...  With a real kid?  Huh?  With a real kid?  Yeah.  It's a voicemail. 
[01:40:30]  Voicemail.  He wasn't talking to Billy?  No, no.  He was talking to his 11- or 12-year-old daughter.  He doesn't even know how old she is.  She recorded it.  He makes Scott Peterson look like Father Knows Best.  How are you doing, Rob?  Oh, just great.  Hey, did you...  I'm here on one of the off-ramps of the L.A. East selling oranges.  Hey, so everyone knows I'm just got fired, which, you know, by now everyone knows our stance on that.  And it just came out in the paper today that Bernie finally got fired. 
[01:41:00]  Yeah.  They waited a week to fire Bernie.  What's McCord doing?  Charles Skates.  He's actually...  He's going to be singing in the Cleveland Light Opera.  No, I think he's doing the news with Mike and the Mad Dog.  Okay.  Yeah, he skates because he pretty much did news for Imus.  He never really got involved with that edgy stuff that you guys got into.  And what about you, Rob?  You were pretty clean on the show.  Oh, no.  I had my moments.  Yeah.  All right.  You're a potty mouth.  I'm just trying to save your career, you idiot.  Oh, yeah. 
[01:41:30]  That's it.  Oh, yeah.  I was afraid when I saw Don Ho died that somebody might not have combed his hair before they buried him.  You know what's really sad is just another dead ho.  Hello, is this on?  I don't even think you're allowed to say that Don Ho died because saying ho on the radio can get you fired.  Actually, his wife's name was Tiny Bowles.  Hey, Rob, what do they say about you?  Are you fired?  I don't believe so.  Not at the moment.  I don't know.  I mean, you know, the way they disseminate information is, you know, I'll read about it. 
[01:42:00]  Right.  Well, when you go to the mailbox, is there a check there?  Well, somebody called me, wanted to know what my zip code was.  They wanted to send me a package.  Oh, great.  That's not good.  Have they replaced the show?  What's on in the time spot?  Michael the Bad Dog.  Listen, you've got to give him a lot of credit.  You've got to give him a lot of credit.  I mean, God's your power.  I mean, Kurt Schilling, could Kurt Schilling throw a pitch so fast?  He himself could not hate it.  He himself could not hate it.  Yeah, they get into something.  They've got a show going on in there. 
[01:42:30]  It's called Foxworthy.  Are you smarter than a 67-year-old Rose Kennedy lookalike in a cowboy hat?  She's 67, though.  That's good.  She's younger.  You know, this is what we try to tell people last week.  We're like, Imus used to take more abuse than he did.  And then he dished out.  Yeah.  He used to beat him up on a regular basis.  I saw Kitty Carlisle live the other day, and I saw the picture of the paper.  But for a minute, I thought it was the end.  Dude, Imus' show, the crew around him, I mean, Bartlett was so great, and Bernard. 
[01:43:00]  Bernard is just a scathingly funny dude, man.  It's, you know, it's like getting the death penalty for a traffic violation.  You know, it's just, it's so totally ridiculous.  I know.  I can't even believe I have to, like, sit here and talk to somebody that's in this situation,  because me and Opie have been in this situation before.  Twice.  Maybe three times.  And I've been asked these dopey questions that I now want to ask you.  Did, when it happened, when the words came out of his mouth, did, was there some kind 
[01:43:30]  of atmosphere in the studio like, uh-oh, that might be trouble?  You know, it was in the context of what they were doing, and it didn't, you know, it just,  it didn't really register until, you know, unfortunately, until too late.  I mean, it's not like, you know, some of the other things that I've heard on the radio  or, you know, the, what was that great song that they had over there with your old producer  that was, uh...  Oh, the Tsunami song.  You know, that was one of those things, or the first time you heard it, you sphincter 
[01:44:00]  slammed shut like a bear trap, you know.  Yeah.  You just knew that there was going to be trouble.  Oh, yeah.  That's trouble.  That one's going to leave a bruise, you know.  Well, because we always talk about when we got that call, and it was like, hey, you  know, it's Paul, I'm here at St. Pat's, we, me and Opie were kind of like, uh-oh, you  know, we knew, like, there was going to be trouble, so I was just wondering if you guys  kind of knew that that was going to be trouble, and if not right then and there, when did you 
[01:44:30]  guys start, like, making the calls to each other, like, this thing has legs, I think we  might be in a little jam up here.  Well, when he apologized, I mean, when he apologized on the air, and it was completely sincere,  you know, we knew that it was serious, and, you know, it should have come sooner, you  know, but I think it was the perfect storm.  There were a lot of things that were going on.  Absolutely.  The only criticism I really have is him bringing Sharpton into it, that in hindsight, maybe,  you know, maybe he might have thought it was a good idea at first, because for some 
[01:45:00]  reason, he's the self-anointed black person's representative, but the fact of the matter  is, it gave him the credibility and then the fuel to keep it going.  Like, no one would have listened to Al if Don didn't talk to him, I think, as much as  they did, because Don kind of singled him out and talked to him.  And who knew that Reverend Al didn't have a heart, that he's pretty much like the tin  man or something?  You can't apologize to him.  You actually thought he was human and would actually listen to what Imus had to say that 
[01:45:30]  day.  Here's what Sharpton said.  But he already had his agenda.  It's the only criticism I have for the whole way that was handled on Imus' side.  I'm sorry, Rob, it wasn't even about, I think, Imus, or I think what that was about is they  saw the door crack a little bit.  They knew that this was a way to get more black people hired for MSNBC.  They knew it was a wedge that they could get leverage from, because that's immediately where  they went after it, and that's what it was used for.  They saw an opportunity and they took it.  It wasn't about Imus being terrible.  It was, you know, I think it was exploited the way that, you know, we've exploited things  so well in the past.  Yeah, sure.  He sees upon something. 
[01:46:00]  I mean, I don't think that the Reverend Al, I mean, Steve Kappas did enough on MSNBC to  really put the nail in the coffin.  I mean, on the Thursday of the Radiothon, Imus is broadcasting a telethon raising money  for three children's charities, and in the next studio, they're bashing him.  That was the most despicable thing I've ever seen done.  It was like to remove it.  First of all, you announce a suspension.  They announce a suspension.  Right.  Which is fine. 
[01:46:30]  That right there takes the heat off of the station.  We're going to suspend him and then reevaluate or something afterwards.  Whatever.  They could have said 10,000 things and let him at least get through his Radiothon and then  fire him if they want.  You know, it's their prerogative.  But to take him off before he starts the Radiothon and then even, you know, the fan,  CBS, you know, we're critical.  We work for CBS and we're critical of them for taking him off on that last Friday during  the Radiothon. 
[01:47:00]  Didn't get a chance to say goodbye to his listeners.  I mean, it was just a punk move on MSNBC's part.  And it was just, you know, it's one of those things where it's just unfortunate that, you  know, they went about it in that way.  But, you know, I mean, Steve Kappas has got that look.  You know, you just know he's going to show up on one of those Chris Hansen specials.  Why don't you take a seat?  I'm an internet predator.  How great is it that Steve Kappas was also responsible for allowing this video manifesto to hit all  our TVs after talking about responsible journalism and the integrity of our news department 
[01:47:30]  was at risk.  That's why we had to get rid of Vimus.  And this isn't good for America to have this going on and blah, blah, blah, blah.  And then then less than a week later, he gets his video manifesto and throws it out there  for everybody.  The problem is that the violence is allowed to be put out there.  And that's the pornography to me.  Sexuality is not pornography.  No, that's great.  I wouldn't be able to walk down the street because I'm so incredibly in doubt.  No, it's very disturbing.  I can't look at the page of anything right now. 
[01:48:00]  The violence is fine.  Violence, bloodshed, fine.  Getting fired is worse than firing.  A booby or the S word?  That's going to do some damage, you know.  Boob?  Spoop, yes.  Boobies and the S word.  Spoobs.  B-Lunk.  Hey, Rob, you guys know you will get hired again.  You will work again.  I mean, obviously, this show is not done.  It's temporary, whatever this is.  You will work again.  Really?  Yeah, we're examples of that.  Oh, that's true.  You know, we've been flirting with Rob for a while now. 
[01:48:30]  Let's just bring it out, finally.  Like, we see him at a comedy show.  We go to his plays that he does on Broadway.  And there's been a little thing like some hints like, hey, Rob, you know, when you're done  with that guy, we'd love to have you.  You're going to pop on over here.  Yeah, but I've C-blocked it every time because guess which seat he'd be in.  There's some serious man love going on, but don't worry, Sugar Pants.  I'm going to have to your job.  Oh, by the way, we have no money to pay you, but we'd love to have you be part of the show.  Internship.  Until someone else pays you. 
[01:49:00]  It'd be a hobby.  Yeah, it could be a hobby, right?  Rob is actually in Chicago now, which my girlfriend and I are going to go see.  I don't normally go to musicals.  Are you singing in Chicago?  Yeah, I do sing.  I don't remember.  You do, definitely, yeah.  I didn't know Rob could sing.  There it is.  He had a huge part in The Odd Couple on Broadway.  It was great.  I was beyond amazed how good you are on that stage there, Rob.  Well, thank you, my friend.  We hope at least out of acting roles.  You know, I didn't exactly get a call from Louis C.K.  when I was doing Lucky Louie, but you know.  Well, they wanted something that would last more than one season for you.  Oh, God, did we get the boot.  The amazing thing that was great about Bartlett is he was on stage with Broderick. 
[01:49:30]  He was on stage with, I mean, I was acting with Louis and Rick Shapiro, who were my peers,  and I was nervous.  I mean, those are my friends.  You were on stage with Matthew Broderick and Nathan Lane and Mike Starr.  I mean, you were up there with real actors, dude, and you looked like you belonged.  And you know what?  He was so much more believable than Broderick and Nathan Lane.  Oh.  You destroyed him on that stage.  I got to call, but more often.  Yeah.  You've been beat up for the last two weeks. 
[01:50:00]  We figured what the hell will help you out a little bit.  Can you get me a tape of that performance?  I missed it.  He was great.  He was really great.  I think that there may be a bootleg audio.  Yeah.  Hey, is Brian Wilson there?  Hey, I'm Brian Wilson.  How are you?  I'm fine.  How are you, Opie?  Hey, we're doing good.  What do you think of the Imus thing, Brian?  You're not going to be able to go on a show anymore and do the weather and stuff.  I can't?  No.  Well, that's okay, because I'm doing a new show with Greta Van Susteren and Mary Jo Buttafuoco. 
[01:50:30]  It's called Talking Out of the Side of Your Mouth.  What's your doctor's name?  That guy that put you on that thing, that program?  Dr. Nick.  Dr. Nick.  He gave me all these pills.  You know why there's not a drug problem anymore in this country?  Why?  I took them all. 
[01:51:00]  Oh, a Dr. McCoppolis reference.  I want to hug him.  Dr. Nick.  I want to hug you, too, Jimmy.  He likes little Jimmy, yeah.  It was the greatest when you were just seeing Bartlett on MSNBC with the awful hairdo and  that stoned look and an Opie and Anthony shirt under an awful flowered shirt.  Yeah, a Hawaiian shirt, Opie and Anthony shirt.  It was great.  What gigs are you doing, Rob?  I know you're doing a lot of, you got some stand-up.  Rob's a great stand-up.  My father and I went to see him years ago. 
[01:51:30]  Dude.  We were IMUS fans.  Let me tell you something.  I went to a, what was it, a roast there, Rob?  Yeah, it was the Joel Hollander roast.  The Joel Hollander roast before, you know, the company kicked him out.  And he destroyed in front of a thousand douches that usually don't want to laugh.  You know, they're just there to be seen.  And Rob hits the stage and roasted Joel and just beat up everybody in the room and just  brought the house down.  What was the first word out of my mouth, Opie?  Frunkus?  Yeah.  Frunkus.  In front of a thousand corporate guys in tuxes. 
[01:52:00]  He gave us a frunkus.  Do a joke for one person in the room.  And then one who wasn't even invited.  Do you know I didn't even get invited to that to see it?  You know how sad I was when I heard you frunkus and I wasn't there in my Sabbath shirt  to watch you?  He said, Frunkus, I'm the only one out of a thousand people barrel laughing, thinking  everyone else is going to laugh.  And then I realized, wow, none of these corporate guys listen to the Opie and Anthony show, obviously.  I'm so sorry.  I had to break that up.  No, it was great, dude.  One of my favorite Bartlett moments on Imus' show on the MSNBC side, you know, the visual 
[01:52:30]  watching it was when he stepped into the weather set with the weather map.  That was my favorite moment, I think.  Oh, my God, man.  Hysterical.  Yeah.  Who was doing the weather?  It was, what was his name, Steve somebody, I don't know.  Yeah, yeah, one of the weather guys.  And Rob just, like, moseys onto the set, staggers onto the set, and he's blowing away hurricanes  on the map.  That's Brian Wilson.  And then I think I gave it O&A Party Rock. 
[01:53:00]  Yeah, O&A Party Rock.  He's got an O&A shirt on.  Everyone's hysterical laughing in the studio.  You guys were so obsessed with our show as you're trying to do your show.  We never really understood that.  And the greatest part was he had references they would do that were like, for any Imus  fans, it happened to be pests, which were probably six crossover people.  Yeah.  And us.  Right.  Not that many?  Yeah, right?  It just shows you we get bored doing this, and we have to, like, do these little things  to entertain ourselves.  Make jokes to each other.  Right.  A million listeners, seven million listeners, and I'm doing lines for four guys sitting in 
[01:53:30]  another studio.  Yeah.  And then we couldn't wait to play the audio on our show.  Hey, Rob, before we let you go, what do you think of Keith Oberman?  Oh, he's just a lovely, upstanding individual.  Yeah.  Talk about somebody who's probably going to show up on one of those Chris Hansen specials.  I hope so.  Yeah.  Why don't you sit down and have some lemonade?  I'm Chris Hansen with Dateline.  We have a couple of things we'd like to...  Did you say?  Yeah.  Here's the transcript.  Is this a picture of your penis?  Can we count this down?  Hey, what gig are you doing, man?  I know you've got some stand-up. 
[01:54:00]  Am I correct?  Yeah, Saturday, the 28th, a week from Saturday, I'm at the Ulster Performing Arts Center up  there in Kingston.  And that is 601 Broadway in Kingston, New York.  And what's your website?  It's robshow.com.  Robbshow.com.  How the hell did you get robshow.com?  That's pretty impressive.  Well, I got it back right before Al Gore invented the internet.  I put it in.  Well, I'll be at Anthony.com if I'm mistaken.  Yeah.  Do you want Ticketmaster your tickets?  I think they're Ticketmaster, but I think the box office also has them.  So, I think that number is... 
[01:54:30]  Okay, it's 845.  It's funny.  You should ask, Rob.  It's right in front of me.  845-339-6088.  That's 845-339-6088.  Saturday, April 28th in the Ulster, which is the worst name I've ever heard.  Ulster Performing Arts Center in Kingston, New York.  Robbshow.com.  Hey, can we get robbed for one of our shows?  I don't want to put you on the spot, but I'm going to have our people talk to your people  and see if maybe we can work something out for one of the shows, maybe one of the local shows.  Get on the virus? 
[01:55:00]  We would love to have you on one of the shows, man.  Dude, I'm great with that.  If we announce you from the Imus show, the place will just leave their mind.  Yeah, they don't know you anyway, man.  That would be so great.  Well, we'll talk.  I don't want to put you on the spot.  Okay, cool.  Hey, Rob, continue calling our show until we get bored with you.  All right.  Yeah, and lose my number, Rob.  I just want one thing to say, guys.  Yeah.  Your mom's box.  Oh, no.  Speaking of that, we met like 20 years ago.  Bob Saget, by the way.  Yeah, yeah.  And you were with my mom's. 
[01:55:30]  No, I ain't right.  But you're a hilariously funny man.  You remember when we met?  It was like 20 years ago.  So I'm crazy in New York.  Eastside Comedy Club?  Yep.  Eastside, right?  Eastside.  That's correct.  Yeah, I was 14.  That's what I told the police officer.  Yeah, way to help Rob out with his career there, Bob.  Jesus.  He was a lot younger.  You do about as much for me as Eddie Murphy.  Yeah.  What does he do to you?  Rob had a lot to do with Adam when Adam was coming up.  Yeah?  Adam Ferrara.  Yeah, Adam Ferrara in the old days. 
[01:56:00]  I remember that's like.  He doesn't call.  Yeah, and now he doesn't call you or anything.  Rob would park a car somewhere and then kiss Adam's neck and go, God, you look like Tony  Denzel.  Dude, we're really, we'll be hearing from you again on the radio.  You know that, man.  This is very temporary and you're a great comic, man.  You're going to be fine.  Thank you, gentlemen.  And anytime you want to call in, feel free, man.  Thanks so much, guys.  And it's really great what you did the past couple of weeks.  We all appreciated it.  And it's really, it's kind of cool to see you guys get so serious and get fired up about 
[01:56:30]  this stuff.  It's really.  What was, yeah, what was the feel like the Ivers' camp when we were like doing our show  about the whole thing?  Oh, I mean.  Oh, no.  Oh, me, you ass.  Oh, no.  Oh, God.  Damn.  Welcome to the crew, Rob.  Oh, that is not right.  The guy was.  My mic's going to get cut now.  Welcome aboard, Rob.  Welcome aboard.  Welcome aboard.  Rob Bartlett, Saturday the 28th. 
[01:57:00]  Ulster Performing Arts Center in Kingston, New York.  Jeez.  He's so must have disconnected.  What a jerk you are, man.  Yeah, but you're enjoying it.  Hey.  More with Bob Saget, who's playing the North Fork Theater tonight in Westbury.  It's the old Westbury Music Fair.  That's how I know it, growing up on Long Island.  Bunch of us are going over there, Bob.  I can't go.  We'll hang afterward.  Bring my daughter.  Austin, all the listeners?  Yeah, yeah.  All the listeners and us?  Yeah, why not?  It's going to be an awful crowd.  It's going to be awesome.  Yeah, we'll figure something out.  But Bob Saget tonight, hilarious.  What did you say, Jimmy?  I tried to get my plug out. 
[01:57:30]  There's no one, like with Rob said, and the phone number is.  Comedians are great at getting plugs out.  Yeah.  And Bob has given his plug because he's in Long Island, and I fired mine out like, and  I won't be able to go.  Hoping someone would go, why?  Why?  And everyone appropriately ignored me.  You know what?  I don't deserve the plug.  It doesn't matter.  No, I want to know where you are tonight.  I'm at the Orpheum in Boston tomorrow night.  Where are you tonight?  The funny part is, I won't be far from you because tonight I'm going to Chickapé.  It's not about me, though.  Who cares?  I'm in Chickapé.  It's a stupid comedy connection.  Does it matter that I'm in?  That's a good place. 
[01:58:00]  Wait, wait, wait, wait.  Hooky Lao, I don't have it.  It's not called the comedy connection.  That sounds too cool.  It is.  It's actually the Hooky Lao.  The Hooky Lao is the name of the restaurant.  They smoke the Hooky?  They smoke hooky?  I don't know.  I don't know.  You don't know where you're going.  I think they serve monkey testicles.  Oh, delicious.  You get paid monkey testicles.  Orpheum Theater, Bob Saget, tomorrow night, Jimmy tonight in Chickapé, Massachusetts.  Chickapé, Massachusetts.  At the Hooky Lao.  The Hooky Lao.  I'm going to be doing something next Friday at Hartford, the Connecticut Forum, which is about  freedom of speech. 
[01:58:30]  Dude, you're not leaving.  That's a speaking thing.  But you're not leaving.  We'll talk about what you're up to next.  Next September.  Yeah, I'm getting an IUD plan.  All right.  Finally.  Two Boogie live in studio.  Take us out of here for a little while.  It's Opie and Anthony Moore with Bob Saget in just a bit.  We'll be right back to this one.  Oh, my God. 
[01:59:00]  I'm not going to do that.  We're on, bro.  Drew Boogie, Opie and Anthony. 
[01:59:30]  I don't care.  It's me and Bob are talking during the...  That's all right, Drew.  You do your thing.  I'll just talk over it.  Yeah, he's just doing his thing.  I got fired once from the GPS.  Did you?  Before I did the Paul Howell show, I walked into work.  I had a morning thing.  It was on against Good Morning America and the Today Show.  I walked in and my chair was gone.  I'm sorry.  I didn't even need to finish it. 
[02:00:00]  Is that how you found out?  I walked in my chair that I was going to sit in to host the thing was gone.  And the producer said, well, try to get your chair back.  And I pictured it like in the sawmill, you know, and the other two hosts were there.  And I was on the steps going, it's 15 minutes after the hour.  Are you sure you didn't just overreact?  Like someone was sitting on his chair across the...  And he just saw that and just left.  Like, all right, I guess there's no time.  Never came back.  Yeah, there was just some guy who was sitting in my on-air camera chair.  Where's Saga?  I don't know where you...  He didn't show up.  That's how they told you?  Yeah.  Well, you know what?  They didn't tell me the night before. 
[02:00:30]  They didn't want to bum me out.  They wanted to get me there that morning so I could say what time it was off camera.  It's show business.  It's kind of weird because we're losing one of our cities.  We got 10 minutes left and one of these cities won't hear us anytime soon.  Why?  Come Monday.  They're just not into the show.  And they kind of proved that from early on.  We never really had a connection with this city, unfortunately.  And we liked this city a lot.  Yep.  And I had no idea this was even going down.  We get a call from our agent late last night saying this has happened.  And I'm like, wow, you would think the station might have like gave us a call personally and said, look, you know, if you don't turn things around or we need this from you or any type of discussion, I'd have respect for you. 
[02:01:00]  Winnipeg?  It's Winnipeg, yes.  Winnipeg.  So our agent called us last night and said, yeah, tomorrow's your last day for a certain city.  I'm sorry to hear that.  We're going to announce it in a few minutes, by the way.  And just remember, we could still be heard on XM Satellite Radio because it'll happen to a few other cities.  Sure.  It's just the nature of the game that we're a part of. 
[02:01:30]  And then we pick up other cities.  That's how it works.  People just like their local person to talk to them.  They don't want to hear from someone in the big city somewhere.  That's what they assume.  Some of the people in radio assume that they want the local angle.  It's like, stop it.  It's good, right?  It's 2007.  It's 2007, right?  You know, I think so.  Checking.  I'm Bob.  I have no idea what year it is.  I am your father.  I drive around New York, and besides maybe getting a traffic report, you have no idea it's local programming.  So that's a crock of crap.  Sometimes I just turn on the traffic reports for, like, L.A. 
[02:02:00]  Always.  When I drive around.  And then I make believe, like, I'm on I-5 or something.  I'm just, like, driving in traffic on the expressway.  You put on L.A. traffic because it's better.  Why do they...  Then you go, hey, these fires are horrible.  Yeah.  These fires are awful.  Look at that smoke that I don't see.  So Bob Saget's playing the North Fork Theater out there in Westbury tonight.  The old Westbury Music Fair.  Yeah.  And we'll be there.  Great venue.  A bunch of us will be there.  Yeah.  What time's the show?  We're going to have fun.  Eight o'clock.  It's a theater in the round.  I know. 
[02:02:30]  I haven't done the round in a long time because I don't want people to look at my ass when I'm on.  Yeah, they slowly spin you.  I mean...  They slowly spin you around on there.  And you've got to worry that, like, the back of your clothes, because comics, for the  most part, you've got a wall behind you and a mic in front of you.  You do your acting.  You get off.  Now you've got to make sure you don't have, like, a wedgie or wrinkled ass pants.  That's being microwaved.  Wait a minute.  Yeah.  You're just slowly on a rotisserie.  But it's Bob Saget.  You should make sure all those things are happening.  Have some, like, toilet paper sticking out of your pants.  I'm going to make a heavy cement.  Or maybe some kind of just stain.  Oh, would it be funny to take a little finger dab of pudding, chocolate pudding, and just dabbing 
[02:03:00]  it on your pants?  Just to hit or miss.  Yeah, and then...  I'm going to wear khakis.  And you can just hear a certain part of the audience as you slowly turn going, oh, oh.  You know what I'm going to do?  I'm going to get a tube, and I'm going to simulate diarrhea.  That I had a problem on stage.  And they will put...  That will be all over the press, won't it?  For one lucky part of the audience, when you're spinning around like a roulette wheel,  they won't know who's going to get hit.  Section 23. 
[02:03:30]  Section 23.  It'll be like spin art.  I'll do the whole room.  Spin art.  I once had a nugget fall out, hit my sneaker, and then roll onto a stoop in front of people  I was meeting for the first time.  Wait a minute.  I thought that was Jimmy's story.  No.  I kicked mine out.  Me and Bill D'Angelo were walking to school, and I kicked mine out to the right like a rockette.  I thought, remember when boxer shorts were in, so I had boxer shorts and some like just  regular shorts on, and I'm saying hi to these people for the first time, and kind of had 
[02:04:00]  something going on, and thought I could get away with it.  Let's just keep it like that.  Yeah.  So I said, all right, I can get away with this quick.  And next thing you know, just a little nugget falls out, hits my sneaker, and rolls across  the stoop.  Must have put that goober in there last week.  Yeah.  What happened?  What's weird is if it's not solid.  I had a friend who had a problem.  He was trying to get into the house in time, and he had a diarrhea problem, and he is in  his driveway.  He was in the driveway.  Wow.  Didn't make it into the house.  He said he threw the car out. 
[02:04:30]  Almost there.  Not just the clay.  It's like your whole system knows when you're close to your house, because you'll be pulling  up in your car.  Or you could be driving and go, you know, I think I'm kind of feeling, I got to kind  of go.  And then right when you pull down your street, you make that last turn, and you see your  house, your body just goes, I'm ready.  It gets excited.  Geared down.  Here we go.  When I was living in Los Angeles, you know where Los Feliz is? 
[02:05:00]  I was on Hollywood Boulevard, which is probably in good moments, an eight-minute, nine-minute  drive from Hollywood Boulevard.  I was in bumper-to-bumper traffic, and I felt like I was going to give birth.  I've never had pain like that.  I literally was like, okay, it's going to happen.  You're breathing?  It's going to happen.  Just think of how you can make excuses if people see you getting out of the car in this  state.  I don't know how I make it home, but I actually have to sit in the car, because if I bend  my legs, I'm going to repaint. 
[02:05:30]  So I wound up making it.  I kind of made it.  Oh, okay.  It was close.  You might have ruined something.  I gave birth to a pot roast.  Unfortunately, company was coming over.  A lot of people on the phones and instant feedback, they want to know if Bob Saget is going to be  part of the O&A Traveling Virus Comedy Tour once again this year.  Yes, he absolutely is. 
[02:06:00]  Bob is doing a bunch of dates.  If I could find them, because tickets go on sale in 10 minutes.  The pre-sale was actually better than we anticipated.  I can't find the sweet sand.  Hey, and I got it.  How did you get together with the radio show, by the way?  Because that was kind of taking a chance, because not a lot of people knew that you would  be perfect for our crowd.  I didn't know I would be either, but I knew that my stuff was kind of hardcore and that  I don't stop.  You know, if people like heckle me, I just want to do my thing.  I just want to be funny.  I'm responsible for Bob Saget being on this program.  Very good.  Well, he was booked as a guest, and we had met on the plane, and I said, hey, you know, 
[02:06:30]  Bob, are you going to be on our show tomorrow?  And I talked, walked to the baggage carousel together.  You were like incredibly, like the nicest guy.  I couldn't believe how nice you were.  It was great.  And then I was on the next day, I remember, and it was one of the most fun hours that  I ever had on radio.  And then we were doing the XM, and it got very blue.  Yeah.  To the point where you guys replayed it a lot, which I was honored by.  But then it also, I said a couple things on it that people come up to me and mention that 
[02:07:00]  I can't ever even think about.  Ever say again.  No, there were like aristocrats.  It's like, you know, the Brady Bunch compared to what the story is.  Yeah.  We were laughing on the plane, too, because at the time we were both mewling heroin.  So like I had, I was full, he was full.  We were like clenched walking to the baggage carousel.  Mule horse.  That's kind of an animal thing.  Yeah.  We were mewling some horse.  Incidentally, I hate to interrupt the mutual love.  I am responsible for Sagat.  Oh, really?  Yes.  What about me? 
[02:07:30]  Well, you are, well, here's what happened.  Bob called in one time.  We didn't get to him, but it was some weird thing.  He thought we were effing with him because he didn't know the show.  Because you guys are very smart.  But he thought we really, really weren't.  We liked Sagat, and it was something really serious going on that day, and he thought,  because as comedians, we get kind of douched by radio shows, so he thought we were douching  him.  We really weren't.  And then I saw Bob at the Caroline's party for the aristocrats, and I'm like, I got to get  a picture with Sagat.  And he looked at me, and he goes, hey, I think he's like Jim Norton, and you knew  me from those Sidesplitter movies or something like that.  Adam Dubin movies.  Oh, I forgot about that story, yeah.  And I bragged, of course, that Sagat knew who I was. 
[02:08:00]  And I'm like, oh, you're...  I've also seen your stand-up.  Oh, okay.  And I just like people that are talented like you.  Oh, thank you.  That love a good pot roast story.  I really do.  There's nothing hotter, hot.  Roast.  And I said to Bob, Opie and Anthony, I'm like...  I made a pot roast baby, and I wrapped it in a towel so it had a head.  I said to Bob, you were going to be on the show, and he goes, yeah, man, those guys,  what happened?  And I explained to him, no, nobody was trying...  It really was an honest thing.  It was a half-hour therapy.  Yeah, but it was nothing bad about you.  And then that healing process started. 
[02:08:30]  Oh, thanks, you.  While many of you have had an enjoyable first-class experience, I was in the trenches talking to  Sagat.  And the shows he is on with us for ONA Virus, he is confirmed in Jones Beach, along with  Stephen Lynch, who was not with us last year.  That's huge.  The Mohegan Sun in Connecticut, Bob, is doing.  And he's also doing Detroit, where we have Carlos Mencia, who's not on some of the other  shows, and he's on Virginia, the D.C. show, PNC.  Oh, I thought you were getting into his personal life.  What?  He's on Virginia. 
[02:09:00]  Right.  Who's she?  And why are you telling this during the plugs?  She makes a mean pot roast.  He's in D.C., and he's at the Twitter Center in Camden.  She steams it.  Twitter Center in Camden, also.  We did that.  That was, like, insane.  Oh, yeah.  And that was my hometown outside of the Philly thing.  Yep.  That was crazy.  It's a nice area.  It's by that bus station.  It's very beautiful.  Yeah, the area is wonderful.  Yeah.  The drive there was great.  I was waiting for some of those improvised explosive devices to explode on the side of  the street.  People making pot roast in the street.  It kind of felt like Baghdad.  It really was. 
[02:09:30]  I knew you could experience Baghdad in America.  I just got a Camden for an afternoon.  And you're driving, and then you end up at a lovely venue.  It's a great venue, and we can't wait to go back there, because that was the highlight  of last year's tour.  What happened?  What happened?  I was pointing at you.  You're pointing at me.  I don't know what you want.  I was pointing at you.  I was pointing at you.  You're bulge.  Oh, I like you.  Because Bob didn't seem to have heard the Alec Baldwin thing.  Do we have time for that, or before we go?  I think we've ran out of time.  Oh, we did run out?  Okay.  Yeah, we're just about done.  Well, maybe we'll play it on XM.  Maybe we won't.  But to this city, we're not going to see. 
[02:10:00]  Are you too busy to go over to XM with us?  No, I'd like to.  Ooh.  Yeah.  Ooh.  Do we have to drive somewhere?  We just walk.  I'll do that.  Underground, though.  We dug tunnels.  Don't worry about it.  We ride on people's backs.  You're completely safe.  Yeah, yeah.  What's going on in Pout Talk?  Well, there's some live action going on.  Is this live, or is it a video?  Who's live?  Who's Cam?  Who's Cam?  Bob, why don't you look at the Pout Talk video?  Man and girl.  Wow, is he a trooper, this guy.  Man and girl in the Opie and Anthony room. 
[02:10:30]  Oh, my goodness.  Wow, looks like someone's going to be late for work today.  Absolutely.  Do you have shoes on?  Who has shoes on?  Damn it.  I almost cursed.  Oh, all right.  Somebody clicked and screwed things up.  Wow.  Oh, that's called teaching a lesson to him.  Oh, God.  You've opened so many screens.  It looks like the beginning of the Brady's.  Yeah.  Yes, except for there'd be one face in the pillow with the other one on.  Oh, the camera's kind of a little low.  Yeah, hey, could you guys aim it, man and girl?  Yeah, boost up your cam.  All right, here's the deal.  Bob Saget, he's at the North Fork Theater tonight in Westbury, Long Island. 
[02:11:00]  A bunch of us on the show will be there.  Can't wait.  Thank you.  I highly recommend it.  I went to his HBO taping.  It's going to be a huge hit for Bob Saget.  Very, very, very, very, very filthy.  You'll see for yourself tonight.  Jim Norton's playing the Hooky Comedy Connection at the Hooky Lao Restaurant in Chicopee tonight at 1030.  And tickets for everybody go on sale for our comedy tour that's hitting your city, hopefully.  A lot of cities this summer.  Right, JimmyTicketmaster.com. 
[02:11:30]  And, well, it's a very, very sad day.  We lose one of our cities.  And before we lose that city, can I say Jim Norton at BroadwayVideo.com if you want to come see my HBO special being taped one hour, June 2nd, in Washington, D.C.  All right.  If you're not joining us over at XM, and by the way, if you're the city that is losing us, never to be heard again or anytime soon, don't forget, we're still heard on XM Satellite Radio.  That's where we're going right now.  And thanks to our friends in that city.  You really have been good to us.  Absolutely.  We have nothing against the show that supported us in that city whatsoever. 
[02:12:00]  I'd like to send my best to the city with no name.  No.  Actually, we say goodbye to...  This is the O.P. and Anthony Show.  O.P. and Anthony.  XM 202.  O.P. and Anthony. 
[02:12:30]  O.P. and Anthony.  O.P. and Anthony.  O.P. and Anthony. 
[02:13:00]  O.P. and Anthony.  Thank you. 
[02:13:30]  Thank you. 
[02:14:00]  Thank you. 
[02:14:30]  Thank you. 
[02:15:00]  Thank you. 
[02:15:30]  Thank you. 
[02:16:00]  Thank you. 
[02:16:30]  What's the problem?  The first problem is...  What?  Opie, what's the problem?  Holy shit.  I want to help.  Is there a problem?  Maybe just too much, like, audio trying to be processed?  Oh, now I can hear myself perfectly. 
[02:17:00]  I don't know.  Welcome to XM Satellite Radio.  Welcome to XM Satellite Radio, and fuck you, Dallas.  There you go.  There's your answer.  Go fuck yourselves.  Oh.  Holy shit.  Are you kidding me?  Give the answer.  Bunch of pussies.  Well, they're not listening to us on regular radio.  I want to fuck with the regular radio audience, I want to fuck with the regular radio audience,  I want to fuck with the regular radio audience, but fuck you, Dallas.  We were on in Dallas.  Like, the guy never paid us attention.  Don't even know the PD's name.  Never called us.  General manager never called us.  PD douchebag.  That's what I'm calling him.  That's right.  Had no...  PD douchebag. 
[02:17:30]  Had no idea.  Bob Eatman calls Anthony and I last night late and goes, uh, I've been working on this  really hard, which means he knew when we were in Vegas, so we got a problem with Bob  that we got to straighten out, and Bob goes, yeah, tomorrow's your last day on the Dallas  radio station.  I'm like, what?  Thanks for the notice.  Came out of nowhere, with no, like, even attempt to maybe try to save the show, or maybe do  things a little differently, or I don't know.  There's a lot of things you could do.  I didn't even know. 
[02:18:00]  Now, I knew we were on in Dallas, but I didn't even know the time that we were on.  It was...  We were on from...  Five to eight, right?  Five in the morning to eight in the morning, which isn't even morning drive.  Here's what they're probably doing.  It's like a piece of it.  We were splitting morning drive with another show down there, and for those of the adult  little radio, it's usually six to ten is morning drive.  It's a four-hour shift.  Yeah.  So we had two hours of morning drive, and we were splitting it with the other one, and I'm  guessing they just went, look, let's just go six to ten and do that.  But five to eight a.m. is what we had, which is just an awful time. 
[02:18:30]  Sure it is.  New York has a lot of people listening at five in the morning, but a city like Dallas, it's  just not big enough to get a respectable audience at five in the morning.  So they decide they're just going to go local with the show that we split the morning show  with.  And I'm not going to trash those guys.  I don't know their show.  Right.  Whatever.  I have a problem with the PD that just kind of, like...  When we were off the air, I met the guy.  He seemed to be a really huge fan.  When you used to go down there and I would follow you down there, Jimmy, I'd talk to  the guy.  And then we'd get back on regular radio, not one call from this guy whatsoever. 
[02:19:00]  So whatever.  I respect people that do things kind of...  Just the fact, even if he was taking the show off the air, that he could have called  and go, look, this is my reasoning.  I like this show.  I just...  If he could have just called, people just never want to do things like men.  Yeah.  They just never want to talk to you.  That would solve so many problems if people just acted like fucking men and picked up the  phone and confronted.  You know?  And I want someone to email him and tell him this for me.  It's a conservative town, too.  Do you think that has something to do with it?  Dallas?  Yeah.  Possible.  Maybe we pissed off some people down there. 
[02:19:30]  I don't know, because no one would communicate with us.  Yeah.  We were never told.  We're in the communication business, and surprisingly...  Nothing.  But it's show business.  I've been...  They let you go without even telling you.  Yeah.  And the next thing you know, cock.  What?  That's always the way.  That's the way I think.  But when they love you, it's unbelievable.  And then that could turn within a day.  Yeah.  Remember when we did the XFL?  It was...  You know, whatever.  I mean, it was a horrific gig for us.  We were trying to do the pregame show for the XFL on NBC.  Right.  We were on NBC there, Bob. 
[02:20:00]  Look at us.  Hey.  See that?  And remember...  Common ground.  And remember, we would be invited into NBC down there in Rockefeller Center.  We'd watch them, like, editing the show, and you guys are great, blah, blah, blah,  taking high-profile meetings, harumph, harumph.  And remember the guy that was in charge of the show at NBC?  Yep.  We took the elevator with him, and the ratings for the first week were massive, just because  everyone had this interest in the XFL.  I'm not trying to defend what we did.  It was awful.  It was an awful show.  Yes.  Oh, it was awesome.  It should still be on. 
[02:20:30]  We were out of our...  Even though the league's gone.  That was a gem.  Don't take yourself down a peg.  You were good.  We were out of our element, but after the first episode ran, we're going with the guy  that's in charge of NBC Sports or whatever.  I even forgot his name.  We were taking an elevator at Giant Stadium, matter of fact, Dan, because we were taping  something there, and he's reading off the ratings, just like, you know, just ridiculous ratings,  because it was the first week.  And man, you guys are unbelievable.  I'll have you up to the office next week.  We'll talk about more things, blah, blah, blah.  Yeah.  The second week, ratings come out, and it's just, just brutal. 
[02:21:00]  We never heard from that guy again.  No, we got one more call from him, and I have a clip from that right here.  I've made an ass of myself believing in you, too.  That's show business, though.  It's like everything's an episode of Entourage, you know?  Right, right.  Everybody's, like, telling you one thing, and then they want to hug you, and then if  you're not hot, they could give a shit.  Yep.  Bye-bye.  Well, I had a big thing with Dallas.  This is probably why we lost the...  I said some...  Look, I'm edgy.  Get used to it. 
[02:21:30]  I said, go Cowboys.  Not.  Oh, well, see, that could have...  I know.  You are out there on the edge.  I take risks.  Jimmy lives on the edge like that.  That's why the name of my new CD is Edgy As I Want To Be, and it's got me with my thumbs  up.  Hey, we got a contact for Pugs and Kelly?  Yeah, I can call them.  Aren't they on right now?  Oh, no, the other show's on.  They're behind.  Shit.  They've been very good.  They're good friends.  It's 8 in the morning, 8.20 right now.  What's with that whole time thing?  When does Pugs and Kelly come out at 10?  I don't understand Central.  They might come on later. 
[02:22:00]  I don't know.  Mountain?  Mountain was it?  I'm sorry.  I'm sorry.  I apologize.  I'm having a sidebar conversation while you're doing real on-air discussions.  Me and Mr. Saget are having a discussion about time zones, and you two are having  another one.  You talk to Bob.  Isn't that great?  I'll talk to the board.  You get two shows for the price of one here.  Welcome to Crosstalk.  Neither good.  What is it with that mountain time?  What's up with that?  What is it?  I just throw these questions out, like, what is it with the time?  What's up with Central?  What's your favorite time zone?  Depends on where I am. 
[02:22:30]  Come on, people.  Give us your call.  What's your favorite time zone?  We're taking your calls.  All right.  Let's go to Whitey in Dallas.  Whitey.  Hi, boys.  No, it wasn't Dick Embersole, by the way, TJ.  It was some other dude in an office.  Whitey, what's up?  Well, I just wanted to call and say farewell, and thanks for sharing some time with us.  They were announcing it on the air today that they've got the new lineup starting on Monday.  And it's kind of a sad thing.  I mean, that radio station, the only reason why I was even listening to it was you guys.  And now with your departure, I'm just going to stick with FM. 
[02:23:00]  And just want to thank you for the laughs and for adding some quality radio out here.  Thank you.  Their timing is so awful because the last couple of weeks, especially, we've really upped our game.  And because of all the big stories happening in America, talk radio is very hot right now.  And we were on fire.  So they should have really gave it another 30 to 60 days.  Yeah.  Whatever.  I think some people do.  Well, I'm still listening to you on XM.  Jim, you keep coming out here to be improv.  I will, man.  Thank you.  And support Pugs and Kelly.  They were very good to us. 
[02:23:30]  They plugged us.  And, you know, those are friends of the show, man.  We have no problem with Pugs and Kelly.  Or even the guy taking the spot.  We don't know what he does.  It's nothing personal.  I mean, he's just doing his job.  And also, thank you, Whitey.  I promised somebody something that we were supposed to do on the other side.  Honey.  And I blew it.  But there's a lot of chatter on the message boards about Paul Mercurio.  Chatter.  And Flea was completely out of line.  Completely.  And I want to make a statement.  And if you're a responsible message board, you can go with it. 
[02:24:00]  Stupid Flea.  We have absolutely no problem with Paul Mercurio.  Absolutely not.  We buried our differences a long fucking time ago.  I don't know how he fits on the new radio show that we've been doing for the last almost three years on XM and stuff.  But as far as Paul Mercurio goes, we're way the fuck past that.  Let me fill everybody in.  Paul Mercurio was actually one of the spotters during the Sex for Sam contest.  He was out with a couple that went to St. Patrick's Cathedral.  The couple was allegedly having sex when they were caught. 
[02:24:30]  Paul Mercurio and the couple stayed at the location, what we deemed at the time especially, too long.  Long enough for the police to arrive and make a big to-do.  That kind of led everybody to believe that Paul was at least a bit at fault for having the cops get there and then get the story blown out of proportion.  And we believe that, too.  We believed that for a while.  And I was open with Paul.  I was angry at Paul for a long time. 
[02:25:00]  And I was open with him about it.  I never said it behind him.  I mean, I told him why I felt that he was not taking responsibility for his part because I've been arrested on the air.  So I kind of knew the vibe.  I had an incident that other people didn't have because I'd been through the jail process being on the air.  But that said, we've talked since then, and he is not responsible for getting us taken off the air.  He was one part that we could have controlled by coming out of it.  We could have controlled by not putting it on the list.  There's a lot of things that could have been done.  And the best of all, Infinity fucking handled it abysmally. 
[02:25:30]  So leave Mercurio alone.  He's not responsible for this fucking show coming off the air.  It was Infinity's cowardice and horrendous handling of the situation.  It was run by a guy who didn't like the show.  Dude, he admitted his responsibility to us, finally.  Yeah, it's time and on.  It's been five years.  Just leave the fucking guy alone.  There were so many people responsible for everything that happened that day.  Us included, you know, of course.  Us mostly included because we're responsible for what goes out over the air.  We will say this when we come back, by the way, maybe in a couple weeks for Free FM. 
[02:26:00]  We should have said it on the other side.  But Flea apparently yelled at him.  And Paul thought he was joking at first.  It was just kind of an altercation.  And here's a real problem.  So Flea said that he's part of our show.  An intern for the show.  He said he didn't say it.  He didn't say it.  But I'm hearing from a lot of other people that say, yes, he did say it.  I heard him say it.  Lamont told me.  Lamont, who is a black photographer.  He does a lot with CringeHumor.net.  He's got no credibility then.  He's a fucking photographer. 
[02:26:30]  I don't like photographers.  And the fact that he looks like a black Darth Vader without the helmet is irrelevant to me.  But I do believe him.  And as much as I think that I probably wouldn't fuck him, I do think that he's honest.  And he said that he heard him say it.  Yeah.  And, you know, just let Paul Mercurio move on with his life.  Yeah, let him do his gigs, man.  We were pissed off for a really long time.  Five years ago, for the love of God.  We had many discussions behind the scenes.  We pretty much banned him from the radio show.  But we're not really sure what to do with him as we move forward here. 
[02:27:00]  Some people hold a grudge like Simon Wiesenthal.  But Paul called me.  That guy could hold a grudge.  Build a museum for Paul Mercurio.  Yeah.  I'd be open for an on-air discussion with him.  I really would because he's reached out many times.  Paul called me yesterday and he was very, very upset.  He's like, what else do I have to do?  You know, he feels like he's been punished enough and, like, you know, he doesn't feel  like it's completely his responsibility.  And I agree with that.  I agree with that.  And actually, Paul sent a clip.  I'm sorry I did that. 
[02:27:30]  I'm embarrassed that I did that.  And then here he is after the flea incident.  I've made an ass of myself.  Let's see.  Is he an actor, Paul Mercurio?  Is that another guy with the name Mercurio?  There might be another guy.  Yeah.  He's a comedian.  He's done some acting.  I want to apologize to the guy that has a similar name to Paul Mercurio because I don't  know Paul Mercurio.  You don't know Paul.  So, apologize to the guy with the similar name.  I want to apologize to some girl that I banged years ago that I don't remember. 
[02:28:00]  And I'm really sorry.  I got, like, a problem with my taint and I threw it out in her anus.  We are reaching the point.  I feel bad about it.  I want to apologize to her.  There's, like, 19 people with their radar going off.  We're reaching that point where that's going to be mandatory.  We're going to have to just back-apologize for everything we did in life.  But Paul was very upset yesterday when he called me and he asked that.  You make him sound like a crybaby.  Well, he asked the show to do this for him and I have no problem with it.  No, we don't.  We have any problem with Paul.  We have moved on from Paul Mercurio a long time ago.  Me and Paul have spoken a few times at Caroline's and stuff. 
[02:28:30]  Had one night, I think it was the night that, um, god damn.  Was it the night Regan was there?  Holy Jesus, were we fucking drunk.  Everybody.  And had a great time.  Had a good talk to him and stuff.  Me and him were talking, doing shots and stuff.  No problem.  It's been five years.  And then Stupid Flea Man from the, uh, has the, like, say he's, is an intern for the show? 
[02:29:00]  Can we get Stupid Flea to call in?  I would like to hear an explanation of this.  Panicked phone calls also to, uh, No Filter Paul.  No Filter Paul.  Uh, my girlfriend got panicked phone calls from him.  I didn't say that.  I just wanted to, tell Anthony I never said, like he was heading it off at the pass.  Like, tell Anthony I never said that I worked for the show.  Before I heard anything about it.  God, he was making sure that there wasn't a media frenzy.  Yeah, he was trying to head it off at the pass.  Maybe he was being smart. 
[02:29:30]  And Lamont heard it, uh, I think he said he heard it last night.  I saw him at the Comedy Cellar.  So if he could call in, I mean, you know, let's get it honestly out on the table.  Yeah.  But, uh, enough people heard Flea say, he probably said it in the spur of the moment.  It's like, come on, man, you can't, you know.  And Paul, actually, I heard, tried to let him off the hook.  Like, he yelled, you suck, in front of, like, a hundred people.  And then he's like, you brought the opioid Anthony show down or some shit like that.  And Paul came back down and confronted him, which I like.  And he's like, oh, why'd you say that?  Dude, you're kidding, right?  Like, please just tell me you're kidding.  Like, like, he tried to defuse it.  Yeah.  And, uh, Flea was just adamant. 
[02:30:00]  Flea wouldn't leave it alone.  And then, apparently, um, uh, something else was said.  And Paul lunged over and punched Flea.  But I heard he didn't punch him in the face or anything.  He just shoved him or something.  It was a little shove or a stuffle.  And then forced him as cocked him.  I wasn't there.  You fucked him in the ass or something.  I heard he roughed him up pretty good to make a statement.  Roughed him up.  And I don't blame Paul, to be honest with you.  You know, Flea, you gotta, you're gonna get your ass kicked really bad one day.  You gotta chill the fuck out.  And you know what's really funny?  Uh, Paul, not, uh, the biggest guy. 
[02:30:30]  You know, I'm, I'm a small guy.  It would be the same thing.  But you got guns.  I got guns.  Oh, you mean literally?  Yeah.  Guns.  I thought you meant my arms.  I'm working out, you know.  Yeah.  Uh.  You have guns?  You have, you have guns?  Oh, I love guns.  You got any pictures?  Love them.  Yeah, I do.  I got a picture on my MySpace of me and, uh, my guns.  Yeah, that's the thing to do.  They cropped his head onto the Oswald photo.  Where they started talking about the shadows.  I'm actually, I'm actually playing the book depository in a couple weeks.  Oh, really?  Yeah, they opened it up.  They opened it up as a comedy club.  Yeah, they do.  Behind the glass partition doing 15 minutes. 
[02:31:00]  That's right.  They do kid parts there and stuff.  How about that fucking video taken from, from the book depository, that cunt who didn't  know how to use a fucking video camera.  She was in the floor below where Oswald allegedly was, filming Kennedy coming up and before he  made the turn down.  And then this dumb bitch aims the camera at the tree and watches the assassination.  Nice one, dummy.  But she came in second place in America's Funniest Home Video.  Ah, yeah.  Did you play some wacky music?  Boing.  Got hit in the nuts. 
[02:31:30]  By the way, so the people don't call in droves, you did say book suppository.  No, I didn't.  Listen to the replay.  Have a good laugh at yourself.  Those are tiny books.  Book suppository.  Book suppository building, sir.  All right, knock it off.  Knock it off.  Did I say book suppository?  Yes.  Why are these books wrapped in aluminum foil?  Ow.  Why do they feel so right?  So, just to summarize, to the pest, can you do us a favor, please, and just get the word  out, really? 
[02:32:00]  Because we know you guys are a bunch of psychopaths, and we actually respect that and appreciate  that, but...  Well, it's right, it's right, but he's actually not an enemy of the show at all.  It's not like this happened a month ago.  Trust me, five years is enough.  Flea's just a douche.  Yeah.  And Flea, you know, a little advice, you gotta chill out, you know?  Yeah.  Flea is one of the most hated people on the message board.  On Earth.  On Earth, yeah.  But he's gonna get himself really hurt.  Everybody is annoyed by him.  I don't know why.  Annoying.  Yeah.  He's an annoying person. 
[02:32:30]  He's just, like, always annoying.  People just...  He could say hi to you, and it's just the way he says it is annoying.  You ever know some people like that that just...  That's all I know.  Oh, that's all you know?  Yeah.  That's all I know.  I have a relative.  I have a relative.  He's like, how you doing?  It's like, okay.  Goodbye.  It's halftime.  No, that's a mean thing to say.  I love him very much.  I'd like to apologize, too.  Do you have relatives that you look at them and just go, like, man, I would never hang  out with these people, but I'm related to them.  I have to. 
[02:33:00]  A lot of relatives, but I feel bad about it.  I was married, you know, and I had a whole ex-family, and they're very nice, you know,  unless you've met other people.  No, but it's hard when you are with people that...  Because you love people sometimes, but you don't want to, like, hang with them because  you're busy, and there's no way out of this.  I still feel bad about it.  Because you're rich, and you're famous, and you're busy, and they're small and boring.  Just say it.  Fuck them.  I have family, too. 
[02:33:30]  I don't acknowledge them.  I wave at them as I drive by in my limousine.  Are you close with your family?  I love my family.  I have shame issues because I just feel like such a shit.  Like, I mean, I have a great sister and a great pair of parents and my nephew.  I have a nice family, but I'm not as close to them as I should be, probably, but it's  more based in self-loathing.  Right.  Really?  Yeah.  You shouldn't hate yourself.  All right.  Because there's other people out there.  I'm all better.  Wouldn't that be funny?  That's all it took.  No one has ever thought to say that. 
[02:34:00]  You shouldn't hate yourself.  Wow.  I don't.  Oh, good point.  It's like your miracle dust.  Thank you.  Yeah, right.  I'm close to that.  I have three kids, and I have an ex-wife, and I have a girlfriend, and I have a nephew,  and I have a mother, and I just want to poison myself.  No, I'm very much...  I love all of them very, very much.  Well, because you got the kids, you still have the connection with the ex, right?  Oh, you're great.  She's a great ex-wife.  But you got one of the good ones.  I got a really good one.  As long as she's...  My joke from my stand-up is she's fucking rich, and that's her boyfriend's name.  She's a really good person. 
[02:34:30]  I met her when I was 17, and my girlfriend's brilliant.  She's a lawyer, and...  And everyone gets along.  Coincidentally, she's 17.  They actually make...  She is.  She just got out of high school.  Yeah, it's true.  They make out and stuff.  It's great.  It's exactly what you'd expect.  We'd run it back on Infrared at night for the kids.  I ask you, because we got the Alec Baldwin voicemail.  You haven't heard this yet.  I have not heard it.  It's great.  He's a brilliant actor, you know.  Yes, he is.  I love him in 30 Rockets. 
[02:35:00]  I kind of felt bad that we had to play this today, but look, we're looking for ratings.  He freaked out somewhere.  At least we admit it.  Apparently, in some roles, he's not acting.  Yes.  Because it's just kind of the guy he is.  Do you ever see Glenn Gary, Glenn Ross?  Yeah, I saw it here with...  Alan Alda?  No, yeah.  Me too.  I want you to see it just to see Alda.  It was Alda, but it was...  Oh, my God.  It was Alda, Liv Schreiber.  Liv Schreiber.  Liv Schreiber played it.  Holy crap, was he good.  Liv Schreiber.  I thought the movie was better, though.  I mean, you hear people say that Alda played Jack Lemmon's part.  Liv Schreiber played Pacino's part. 
[02:35:30]  I forget this one guy's name who played Kevin Spacey's part.  Jeffrey Tambor was in it.  Yeah.  Tom Wopat.  Tom Wopat.  Yeah.  Tom Wopat.  And fucking Gordon Claps from NYPD.  Which I had a bad case of, and I also...  You had Gordon?  And Jimmy Chlamydia.  Case of the Gordon.  His agent, Jimmy Chlamydia.  What?  Which is a pasty, pasty vagina.  We want to turn on the studio mic, because you're getting a huge glass, but...  Oh, I didn't even know they were out there.  I don't think...  Ladies don't laugh at pasty vagina.  Just saying...  One did.  I worked with her once. 
[02:36:00]  We have a couple of girls out there.  Case of the vagina.  Yeah, when she walked, it was like shoes rubbing together.  She's something.  You ever get a fucking...  She's something.  You ever get a yeast infection box?  No disrespect, but it was fucking...  When you're fooling around with a girl, and you look at her, and it looks like her fucking  pussy is drooling milk.  Oh, God.  It's like, hey, bread box, you want to fucking cut the malarkey?  It's fucking horrid.  Expiration date on her labia.  Jesus.  Cottage cheese twat.  Stop wearing tight pants.  Cottage cheese twat.  Now, wait a second.  You're talking...  Usually, it's a cottage cheese ass, but if it's a twat with cottage cheese, it's a gun. 
[02:36:30]  It's leaking.  You're talking about a fanny pack made of flesh in front.  No, no, no.  Oh, no.  It's a hangover.  It's a shelf brow above the vag.  Is that what you're saying?  No, no, no, no.  I mean that when the lip...  Bring the kids in the room right now.  You ever fuck a girl, and you pull your dick out, and there's that little fucking...  It looks like a piece of feta cheese fell on it, and it's like milky white shit,  because she's got a yeast infection.  I'm not even trying to be gross.  Every guy has done that, where you pull back, and the fucking room smells like a shoe, and you're  like, could you do something about this?  Fucking...  How about some Cranapple? 
[02:37:00]  Cranapple.  You've got to soak it Cranapple.  Yeah.  Right.  All right.  Here we go.  Let's get the Alec Baldwin on the radio here.  So this is a voicemail he left to his 11 or 12-year-old daughter.  He doesn't even know how old she is.  And we got the Alec Baldwin statement that was just released.  Oh, a statement just released?  I'm upset about this.  I'm a fan of his.  It's just brutal, man.  Fuck her.  He blames the Jews.  Yeah.  And why not?  Here we go.  Actual voicemail.  Thank you, TMZ.com.  And Kim Bessinger, I believe we think...  Everybody needs credit now. 
[02:37:30]  TMZ.com.  Discover this.  Or they got it.  I don't know.  Hey, I want to tell you something, okay?  And I want to leave a message for you right now.  Because, again, it's 1030 here in New York on a Wednesday.  And once again, I've made an ass of myself trying to get to a phone to call you at a specific  time.  When the time comes for me to make the phone call, I stop whatever I'm doing, and I  go when I make that phone call at 11 o'clock in the morning in New York, and if you don't 
[02:38:00]  pick up the phone at 10 o'clock at night, and you don't even have that goddamn phone  turned on, I want you to know something, okay?  I'm tired of playing this game with you.  I'm leaving this message with you to tell you, you have insulted me for the last time.  You have insulted me.  You don't have the brains or the decency as a human being.  I don't give a damn that you're 12 years old or 11 years old, or that you're a child, 
[02:38:30]  or that your mother is a thoughtless pain in the ass, who doesn't care about what you  do as far as I'm concerned.  You have humiliated me for the last time with this phone.  And when I come out there next week, I'm going to fly out there for the day just to  straighten you out on this issue.  I'm going to let you know just how disappointed in you I am, and how angry I am with you,  that you've done this to me again.  You've made me feel like a f***, and you've made me feel like a fool over and over and 
[02:39:00]  over again.  And this crap you pull on me with this goddamn phone situation that you would never dream  of doing to your mother, and you do it to me constantly, and over and over again.  I am going to get on a plane, and I'm going to come out there for the day, and I'm going  to straighten your ass out when I see you.  Do you understand me?  I'm going to really make sure you get it, that I'm going to get on a plane, and I'm going 
[02:39:30]  to turn around, and I'm going to come home.  So you better be ready Friday the 20th to meet with me, so I'm going to let you know just  how I feel about the rude little pig you really are.  You are a rude, thoughtless little pig, okay?  All right.  To replay, dismiss.  To replay?  That is the Massapequa Alec Baldwin.  That isn't the Hollywood Alec Baldwin.  That's the Long Island Alec Baldwin.  I'm so upset about this.  Isn't that just the joy putt?  I'm so upset on so many levels.  I'm upset for, obviously, the kid. 
[02:40:00]  Yeah, the kid.  I'm upset for him.  I don't...  I'm up...  You know, the kid got mad and got the voicemail and put it on the thing and gave it to everybody.  Well, that's...  If you think the mother, probably the mother did it.  That's Kim.  You think the mother did it?  Yeah, absolutely.  Because it might be something the kid would be like, you know...  They are...  Yelling at me?  They are internet savvy, so maybe she did.  It's so sad.  What do you think the worst line of that is?  The worst line of that is the pig line.  The pig.  The pig.  You don't...  I'm going to come...  I can't...  The father-daughter dance is going to be terrific, though. 
[02:40:30]  They're going to make up for the father-daughter dance.  I'm going to straighten your ass out, Rie.  I'm so sad.  Maybe a carnival on Sunday?  I hate the media so much that this shit gets out.  There's been so much, and I know that I'm...  I mean...  Bob, we've played it three times already this morning, so you could be mad at us, too.  No, I'm not...  I'm upset that...  One thing we won't be is hypocritical.  I will say, we are exploiting the shit out of this.  Right.  Well, everybody wants to hear it.  I wanted to hear it.  You go on the YouTube, and you hear something terrible, and the director freaks out. 
[02:41:00]  Yeah, yeah.  You've got to hear that.  But it's just...  What's happening is we're making sensationalism at the lowest of human...  Excuse me.  Oh, speaking of lowest.  I'm going into the base.  Your seat just went down.  Where are you going, Angel?  My seat totally douched me.  Bob, don't be shy.  What I'm saying is, I just...  You can't...  We're doing lowest of humanity.  We're not...  Yeah.  No one's going, oh, what a hero.  What a great...  No one gives a shit about somebody who's doing something great.  Who's fucking up, and how can we find it and exploit it?  And hurt them with it. 
[02:41:30]  Yeah, hurt them with it.  With a parental thing about the whole thing.  That's what gets you...  Like, I'm not a parent, so to me, this is pure comedy.  I saw you cringing.  Everybody loses it with their kids.  Yeah.  Because being a parent is hard.  And being a kid is hard.  It's really hard.  Adolescence, it fucking was the end of my life.  I can't even believe I'm alive.  I was so miserable.  Yeah.  And I became a comedian.  I was popular or unpopular.  I was a fucking nerd.  It was terrible.  But, you know, to be a kid and to have someone, you know, it's just... 
[02:42:00]  The horrific part is I'm coming up for one day, and then I'm going to turn around and go right back.  Yeah.  Then I'm going back.  But we're going to straighten this out.  Calling her a pig.  But I've gotten angry at my kids, and I've said things like,  You're being selfish, or you're selfish, the eyes roll back,  and we have these long discussions, and we have to resolve it.  But I'm very, very lucky.  I have three amazing kids, and they have a great mom, and I've worked really hard,  and having a great ex-wife, mother, is a giant thing. 
[02:42:30]  So, obviously, when you divorce, people pity each other all the time.  But to have a fucking recording of it, and to be famed,  and to have it out there.  Yeah, that's...  Are we here on the sensitive side of Bob Saget?  I know.  It's a little scary.  You should be at the edge of the bed.  I'm getting a little uncomfortable.  Wait a second.  Hold on.  Then I came in the hooker's mouth.  All right, Bob Saget!  Now go to bed, honey.  All right.  This is me in two rooms.  Honey, I'll be right back.  Okay, hold on a second.  Now, how was I fingering you before? 
[02:43:00]  So, it's very complex, my church and state.  But that really upset me deeply.  The pig line is what sunk him.  The pig line is so nasty.  If he said Brat, that would have worked.  Yeah, that is not something you tell your daughter.  However, she loves Charlotte's Web.  So, that, for her, is a compliment.  It could be nice cartoon pig.  We're going to cheer you up.  What about his statement?  Yeah, do the statement.  But I'm going to play the same thing, and I'm going to make it cheery for you, Bob.  You look all depressed now.  All right. 
[02:43:30]  Alec Baldwin's representative released a statement to Extra last night, and I quote,  In the best interest of the child, Alec will do what the mother is pathologically incapable  of doing, keeping his mouth shut and obeying the court order.  The mother and her lawyer leaked this sealed material in violation of a court order.  Although Alec acknowledges that he should have used different language in parenting his  child, everyone who knows him privately knows what he has been put through for the past six years. 
[02:44:00]  That is his statement in defense of calling his daughter a pig.  And I think, you know what, though?  I mean, I think, I don't have kids, but she was probably acting awfully and old enough to  know that she was at least being kind of douchey to him.  He just shouldn't have called her a pig.  He was probably, he sounded like he was a little hurt that she wasn't there by the  phone when he said he would call or something.  It all comes because if he misses her and he loves her and he doesn't know how to  deal with it because he can't communicate with it because he's working and she's not  responding because she feels hurt. 
[02:44:30]  It's all that fucking therapeutic.  Why don't we make it a little cheery for you, Bob?  Do it.  Here, hit me with the same voicemail, a little more cheery.  Hey, I want to tell you something, okay?  And I want to leave a message to you right now.  It's Benny Hill.  It's Benny Hill music.  Now it's fun.  I've made an ass of myself trying to get your phone to try to do a specific time.  When the time comes for me to make the phone call, myself, whatever I'm doing, I go when 
[02:45:00]  I make that phone call at 11 o'clock in the morning in New York, and if you don't pick  up the phone at 10 o'clock at night, and you don't even have that goddamn phone turned  off, I want you to know, I'm hired to play in this game with you.  I'm leaving this session with you to tell you, you have insulted me for the last time.  You have insulted me.  You don't have the brain or the decency.  As a human being, I don't give a damn that you're 12 years old or that you're a child or 
[02:45:30]  that your mother and father's pain in the ass or that you care about what you do as far  as I'm concerned.  You have humiliated me for the last time with this phone, and when I come out there next  week, I'm going to fly out there for the day just to straighten you out on this issue.  I'm going to let you know just how disappointed in you I am and how angry I am with you that  you've done this to me again.  You've made me feel like and you've made me feel like a fool over and over and over again. 
[02:46:00]  Okay, terrific.  And the crap you pull on me with this goddamn phone situation that you would never dream  of doing to your mother, and you do it to me constantly and over and over again.  Stop whining.  I am going to get on a plane.  Stop whining.  And I'm going to come out there for the day.  Stop whining.  And I'm going to straighten your ass out.  Stop whining.  Do you understand me?  Stop whining. 
[02:46:30]  I'm going to really make sure you get it.  Then I'm going to get on a plane, and I'm going to turn around, and I'm going to come  home.  Would you dare be ready Friday the 20th to meet with me to let you know just how I feel  about what a rude little pig you really are.  You are a rude, flawless little pig, okay?  To replay this message.  I got exclusive audio of the daughter.  I hate you.  Oh, man. 
[02:47:00]  Now we really got to get happy.  See, that felt better, though, with that music.  Anything to the Benny Hill music, automatically it makes it funny.  I interviewed him once.  I interviewed him once.  Really?  Yes, yeah.  Did he hit on you?  He did.  And he had that white milky, milk of magnesia coming out of his mouth.  Oh, no.  That white stuff.  I think it was milk of magnesia.  In the corner of his mouth.  Yeah.  It might have been something else.  He was very funny and very, very nice.  Did you get a photo with him?  He blew me.  In the picture, on a donkey.  That's great, man.  No, yeah, I did.  I interviewed him.  I had a five-minute interview with him.  That's nice, man.  Yeah, but then they fucked up because I fucked up. 
[02:47:30]  I interviewed him, and I was backwards.  I was on the same side of the axis.  You know what that is?  When you shoot something, it looked like you do an interview, but you got to flip the  camera to a different spot on the other side of the thing.  Yeah, or else it's silly.  I had to flip myself in the post situation, so it looked like I had a stroke.  My hair was on the other side of my head.  How the hell?  When did you start?  Can we get a copy of that?  Can we play that sometime?  I would love to play that.  I would find it, yeah.  If I can find it, I don't know where it is.  That's cool, man.  I had a comb over.  Hey, we got our food, so we're going to take a break. 
[02:48:00]  I have to take a break.  I wanted to play my message, too.  Oh, yeah.  Let's do it after the break, please.  Yeah, we'll do it after the break.  Dude, I got the same one, by the way.  Okay, unbelievable.  I really want to know why we got that stupid voicemail.  I'm not so much pissed that I got the mail, but we'll do it after the break.  You'll explain, okay.  Hey, we got a live studio audience today.  Let's hear you guys out there.  A nice crowd to the wall.  We got Bob Saget playing the North Fork Theater in Westbury tonight.  A bunch of us are going to be there. 
[02:48:30]  It's going to be a lot of fun.  And Drew Boogie in studio.  Take us out for a little bit, Drew.  Good evening.  Good evening.  All right.  All right.  We'll be right back. 
[02:49:00]  No.  No. 
[02:49:30]  No.  No.  No.  My health doesn't allow it.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  Successfully selling hot dogs in the desert to cities all over the country.  This hot dog is wet, and it smells like tuna fish.  I'm from the ground.  My health doesn't allow it.  Not at all.  Yeah.  No.  No.  No.  No. 
[02:50:00]  No.  No.  No.  No.  No.  Sous-titrage ST' 501 
[02:50:30]  True Boogie in studio on XM Satellite Radio.  People are getting their tickets through Ticketmaster for our ONA Traveling Virus Comedy.  It's very, very cool.  A lot of people are very excited.  They're calling, going, hey, I got my tickets, blah, blah, blah.  I can't wait to see Bob Saget.  And the rest.  So it's very interesting.  We're getting to know Bob and not happy with the media in general these days, huh, Bob? 
[02:51:00]  No.  I think it all started with the OJ thing, by the way.  And it's just been.  What happened there?  I've been out of it a little.  But it started right around.  That was a lot of porn.  What was that?  When he won the Heisman?  Yeah.  I think the OJ thing just completely escalated this thing.  And they realized, the media realized, wow, man.  You could go back further.  Even further?  I think.  Joey Buttafuco, I think, maybe?  Yeah, it started with all that A Current Affair, that tabloid journalism.  All that shit.  Yeah, all that kind of stuff. 
[02:51:30]  But the Buttafuco thing was huge.  Amy Fisher, and then your regular mainstream media news used to laugh at that A Current  Affair stuff.  They wouldn't pay attention to that.  That's tabloid journalism.  But now, the mainstream news is that.  You walk out of a bar and they're like, we want to ask you a question.  Oh, you're with A Current Affair?  No, we're with CNN.  Yeah.  CNN, can't talk to you.  What happened?  Is it true that you had anal entry?  Yeah, what?  CNN?  Yeah.  Are you sure you're with CNN? 
[02:52:00]  I shoved a praying mantis up my ass.  You're going to air this?  Yeah.  But it's just, the violence of it is what's so sad to me.  Because if you see a kid wearing Commando stuff and he's on the front page of the major  publications, it's telling people this is G.I. Joe.  You know, this is something to...  Right.  You're hurt by society.  You're a taxi driver.  We are in...  We are a living taxi driver.  Yeah.  And celebrating the fucking Travis Bickle on the front of something.  On the front of the newspaper is this action hero, this anti-hero.  He's there with his guns and he feels dejected and rejected from society. 
[02:52:30]  So he's going to take it out on everybody.  And it's this anti-hero thing that...  But, you know, in a movie, it's fine because it's a movie.  In real life, you don't celebrate that by giving him exactly what he wanted, which is  front page and...  Well, we're more uptight with sexuality, obviously, than we are...  Which is ridiculous.  I think it was Nicholson's...  Jack Nicholson had that line, I think, where you can't show a nipple, but you can shoot 
[02:53:00]  one off.  Oh, wow.  You know, you can show violence, but you can't show sex.  And my stand-up, what's been freeing for me is to be able to come out and just say whatever  I want.  And I don't really talk about violence that much, kind of, if, you know, fucking an animal  and splitting it open and stuff like that.  But you're going to...  You've got to eat after you fuck.  But, you know, but that's just because it's nine years...  I'm a nine-year-old talking filthy, but...  Why do you always have to bring it back to yourself and your comedy?  And another thing is...  But only because I'm at the North...  I'm a serious discussion here.  You're right.  I'm sorry. 
[02:53:30]  But that guy, if he only had seen me at the North Fork Theater tonight, or at the Orpheum  tomorrow in Boston...  He felt so much better about himself.  Or where are you, Jim, tonight?  Funny you should ask, Bob.  In Chicopee, Massachusetts, at the Hooky Lao.  Yuck.  You're doing the Orpheum.  I'm doing the Hooky Lao.  Why don't you cancel your show and come to my big theater store at the Orpheum in Boston?  You're not like two hours from Boston.  I'll be like two hours away.  Dude, cancel your show and do a little time on his show. 
[02:54:00]  I'd put you up, let you talk about your vagina.  Oh, fuck.  Fucking A.  All right, Bob.  Gonna pay me a little money.  Wait.  You know, maybe you should do your gig.  You're committed.  Yeah, go ahead.  You can't cancel last minute.  Super Jew.  Saved by Super Jew.  Going with what you were saying, Anthony said it yesterday.  This video manifesto hits the media, right?  And it's just unbelievable.  Which it shouldn't be called in the first place.  And they're bleeping out curses.  Yeah, he cursed in the video.  That's what they found a problem with.  And that was the most offensive part. 
[02:54:30]  And they're showing bodies being dragged out of windows.  Bodies being dragged out.  Him holding his guns.  Him talking this just psychobabble about killing people.  Talking nothing but hate.  And then they found the most offensive part that shouldn't be aired was the word shit.  Because that might...  Have you ever seen his shit?  It's disgusting.  Okay, maybe that's it.  Maybe the shit was so offensive.  But the thing is, the kids are watching this.  And that's the thing I...  That's the thing that the kids will have a problem with?  You know, that...  No, but I mean, the kids are seeing bodies dragged out. 
[02:55:00]  They don't even know what the horror is of it.  I was talking to my daughters about it.  And it was like, you know, they have their own issues that day.  And I'm like, I'm worried to death.  Have you seen the news?  And thank God they didn't.  Because they're self-involved.  They know...  And if they heard the word shit, though...  Oh, I'm their dad.  Yeah, exactly.  It's not going to damage the shit.  The only word they don't hear all day long is crap.  But Zana...  And that's where I draw the line.  And, uh...  That's good.  You're a good dad like that.  Thank you. 
[02:55:30]  We're also in the New York Times today.  And we're just beyond pissed at Jacques...  What's his last name?  Jacques Steinberg.  What a jizz bucket.  Jacques Steinberg.  Jacques Steinberg.  And we called him out.  We tried to get him on our show today.  He knows we were calling because his assistant answered the phone.  And he refuses to talk to us, even though he had no problem writing some inaccurate things  about us in the New York Times today.  And I'm just getting word from one of the fans out there that Neil Bortz is also trying  to get this dick on his show.  So bravo. 
[02:56:00]  I don't know if we would even like Neil Bortz.  But bravo to him for calling this fucker out, too.  I'll bet you we'd like Neil Bortz if we peeked at him and saw him through a buddy booth.  I'll bet you we'd like him then.  Neil Bortz.  Neil Bortz.  Neil Bortz.  Bortz alert.  Oh, Flea hung up?  All right.  Why did Flea hang up?  We were just about to get to you.  Fuck, I'm in his ass.  Maybe he got disconnected.  Maybe Mercurio punched the phone out of his hand.  Let's go to Lamar in Queens.  Lamar.  It's Lamar.  What's up, guys?  Oh, Lamar.  What's up?  Oh, Lamar.  Hey.  Lamar. 
[02:56:30]  Hello.  Yeah, I was there that night.  Where are you?  And Flea made an ass of himself, pretty much.  Mm-hmm.  What did he say?  Well, you know how you guys play the game where you call someone's name and look away?  Yeah.  Which we love.  That's cool.  The problem was when Paul looked, Flea just said, Paul, you suck.  I thought the idea was to say nothing.  Right, right.  So he says, you know, Paul, you suck.  So Paul comes down, confronts him on it, and is like, dude, why'd you say I suck? 
[02:57:00]  And one of the things Flea did say, and he claims he didn't say it because there's like  five witnesses, was that he was an ONA intern.  Now, I know for a fact, you know, I have a better chance of being an ONA intern than him.  And I'm black.  You could be an ONA.  We would hire a black intern in a second.  Yeah, absolutely.  Then we could do more black humor.  That's how it works in media.  Exactly.  You could use me like Robin.  Absolutely.  Yeah, yeah.  He, you know, he said that and Paul gave him every chance basically to back out of it. 
[02:57:30]  You know, even to the point going, ah, come on, you're fucking around, right?  This is bullshit.  And he's like, no, you know, he's standing on the ground because we're there.  I think he assumes we're going to back him up.  But, you know, you get yourself in a situation.  You have to get yourself out of it.  Yeah.  We don't want people representing the show when they're not working for the show.  Jesus.  Well, at least we know.  But, I mean, to say that to Paul is a bad reflection on you guys.  Yeah.  Well, yeah.  And then people that don't know us are hanging around and they hear it. 
[02:58:00]  And Paul did tell me he showed unbelievable restraint.  But then he got to a point where he's like, look, I had to make an example of him.  And, you know, I personally understand that.  So, oh, that's what I was saying earlier.  Like, Paul isn't the biggest guy.  And they were putting pictures of him up on the website and going, this is the guy that punched Flea.  And, like, they show Paul Mercurio, who isn't a big guy.  And it really makes Flea look bad that he got manhandled by Paul.  Yeah, it was a little thrashing.  It wasn't so many punches in the face.  Flea claims he only got hit three times in the shoulder through three layers of clothing. 
[02:58:30]  And it didn't hurt and whatever.  But I think he should call.  But, you know, he's such an attention whore.  And now he doesn't want the attention.  I don't get that.  He was on the line and we didn't get to him fast enough.  And the other thing Paul did say is he goes, trust me, I made sure I didn't really hurt the kid.  Yeah, if he wanted to hurt him, he could have knocked his face off.  He goes, trust me, I could have just, you know, knocked his face in.  He definitely could have.  And we said it earlier, and I really want the message to get out.  We're done with Paul Mercurio.  We don't have a problem with the guy anymore. 
[02:59:00]  All right?  We were really pissed off and we kind of worked it out.  And we don't know what his participation in the show will be as we move forward.  But we don't want anyone harassing him anymore.  We have no problem with Paul.  Exactly.  All right?  All right, sweetie.  Thank you for calling.  Take care, dude.  Have a good show tonight.  All right, Lamont.  Take care.  And this is an actual voicemail that Flea left.  Ew.  Who is he calling a pig?  Nobody?  No.  One.  Safe message.  Safe message.  Lamont, give me a call.  Please, please, please let me know what's going on. 
[02:59:30]  I really, really, really need to know.  Fucking please do it.  I'm going to keep calling.  I don't give a shit.  Just fucking give me a call back.  I really need to know, okay?  Thank you.  Bye.  To replay this message, press...  This was outside the club.  Oh, panicky.  Peace.  Please, please, please call.  Oh, my God.  Please.  You know what?  We can't leave voicemails anymore.  No.  No one can.  They will air.  You can't really go anywhere.  You've got to be in a bubble or wear a helmet or something.  Yeah.  It's a cone of silence.  That's what we all need.  There's an embarrassing one of me floating around somewhere. 
[03:00:00]  Is there?  Fuck yeah.  Oh, no.  Why did you get arrested?  Oh, no.  Why did you get arrested?  Because I was on the voyeur bus with the OPNS on the show.  It's because of this dumb show.  Yeah, Bob.  You're just starting to, like, I don't know, hang with us.  Maybe we should give you a little advice.  Get away.  Don't run away.  Not necessarily run away.  Just don't agree to do anything except the virus tour.  And that's marginal.  That might end up a disaster.  Don't ever let your guard down, okay?  I understand.  Louis Black was in the joint with Jim Norton for how many hours?  What?  We spent 19 hours to get him. 
[03:00:30]  No, 27 and 27.  We got Louis Black arrested.  How?  He doesn't do anything.  That's right.  Exactly.  One day he decides to do something on a whim, too.  Spur of the moment.  He was just like, ah, you know, it was a voyeur bus.  It's this bus that has glass sides.  And these girls were living on it, topless and with little thongs on.  I know about this.  And there was a shower and beds in it and shit.  And they decided to come down to the show.  So we were like, hey, that's cool.  Why don't the guys go out, grab cell phones, and take a ride down Broadway, down Times Square, 
[03:01:00]  and hang out, like, in front of the mayor's mansion, and then drive back up, up 6th Avenue.  So it's like, okay, Jimmy goes with the cell phone.  And then Louis is hanging out in the studio and decides last minute, pretty much, he goes,  ah, you know, I'm going to take a ride.  You know, so he hops in there.  They're driving down.  Police were escorting the bus for a little ways.  And the crowds, this is right through Times Square.  There are nude girls through Times Square.  The crowd was amazing. 
[03:01:30]  The girls stop in front of, the bus stops in front of the mayor's office and decides to take a shower.  A CNN reporter was on the bus for a short time, being very friendly.  This is great.  Wow, amazing.  So what are you girls doing?  Just to jump in, we weren't media savvy yet.  So we thought that CNN being on a bus filled with teenage naked women is good for us.  Legal teenage naked women.  That it could only be good for the Opie and Anthony show.  That they'll do a positive piece on CNN.  That's how stupid we used to be. 
[03:02:00]  So she gets off the bus, the CNN thing, and she goes, okay, well, thanks.  She gets off the bus, immediately goes to the mayor and goes, let me show you a little video of what's going on down Broadway in your fine city.  There's a bus of nude women going down.  It's a radio show and stuff.  And so Giuliani got involved.  And the bus is then making its way back up toward the studios up 6th Avenue.  And the bus notices that traffic is really absent.  They're pretty much the only vehicle.  And there's a round rush hour. 
[03:02:30]  There's those blue sawhorse police get the fuck out of here things.  Because they're closing down 6th Avenue because the president had just landed Clinton at Kennedy and was working his motorcade up to 6th Avenue.  He needed to get to the bus.  It was a perfect storm of fuck up.  And somehow the border bus was able to get on this road, the road, this avenue that was closed down.  And out of nowhere, a combination of NYPD brass.  I mean, they had the shoulder shit, the medals and everything. 
[03:03:00]  Brass.  Unmarked, just black vehicles.  Secret Service.  Sheriffs.  Troopers.  Everything just descended on this bus and pulled everybody off of it and arrested them immediately.  Holy shit.  And then ripped the bus apart.  Just ripped the bus apart.  Someone might have flushed some pot down the toilet.  We don't know for sure.  I wasn't there.  I wound up spending.  Me and Lewis both smoked at the time. 
[03:03:30]  And we were jonesing with cigarettes.  Yes.  And each other's cocks just to turn the other inmates on because they didn't hit us.  And it was funny.  We said to one of the friends, can me and Lewis stay in the cell together?  And he goes, what, are you going to protect each other?  Yeah, you're right.  And Lewis is panicking.  And, you know, clean water.  Don't make me point at you.  So it was a wild day, man.  It was really a bad day.  I had to shit like nobody's business if I can use such harsh talk.  And you couldn't?  No, because the toilets were filthy.  And one in the main... 
[03:04:00]  You had to shit in the room with everybody?  It was one of those things.  Oh, it's awful.  It's just awful.  Is the toilet right there in the room?  Yeah, but there's roaches on it.  They're looking at you.  It's jail.  They don't want it to be nice.  The toilet in the room with everybody?  No, you have a little stalled off area, but you're in the room.  Oh, okay.  You don't go to your own restroom.  And did they have warnings all over the place for what disease?  It was...  Tuberculosis?  Not hepatitis.  The fuck wasn't it?  It wasn't good.  It wasn't good.  It wasn't elephantiasis?  Yeah.  They had to have signs of Bob, though, to tell people that you could get this from being in the cell.  I forgot what it was, but... 
[03:04:30]  Yeah.  The vapors.  Typhus.  Typhoid.  We lost track.  Ancient disease.  Just to keep in mind, we've lost track of how many people have been arrested because  of this radio show.  Yeah.  It's ridiculous.  We truly have lost track.  I gotta go.  So you might want to...  The virus.  You can't get arrested with the virus, right?  The virus.  The virus.  The virus.  The virus.  The virus.  Before I go out on stage.  Yeah.  You'll be all right there.  But as...  You know, we've had a lot of press clippings over the years.  That's the only one I actually hang up.  It's because it has Clinton, Opie and Anthony, and Voyeur Bus all in the same story. 
[03:05:00]  I'm proud of that one.  And Giuliani actually was at the podium speaking and addressing the situation.  And actually called us stupid.  Stupid.  Just stupid.  Stupid.  Just stupid.  The future president of the United States actually called us stupid.  America's mayor, at least.  Yeah.  Flea is back on the phone.  All right.  Let's get to the bottom of that.  No, I did not.  You better not.  If I did, you'd know.  You embarrass us in front of Mr. Sagan.  Oh, excuse me.  I have a bag.  I have a colostomy bag.  Am I being accused falsely of farting?  Something I didn't tell you about me. 
[03:05:30]  Did you fart?  No.  No, I never fart.  Now I have to.  I mean, I do when I'm on a toilet and it got poop in me.  Now I'm going to.  What?  What?  I didn't like being.  No.  I fart.  I don't know.  I don't like farting.  I have a problem with it.  Yeah, I do.  It smells like shit.  I didn't do it.  What is that?  I don't like that smell.  Now I think an apology is in order.  Well, here's what happened.  I'm sorry, Jimmy.  Something has smelled.  Maybe it was the fruit.  And I thought I farted and immediately blamed me.  And it hurts.  And when I'm hurt, the good feelings have to come in and push those bad hurt feelings out.  My dad used to say that.  I got to release the poison. 
[03:06:00]  Don't you want me to release the poison?  I can die.  Can you sneeze?  I said, is there a way to...  I used to say, yeah, I'll get sick if I keep this inside.  They don't want to hear this, though, Jimmy.  Look at them.  They're all shaking their heads.  They don't want to see.  Yeah, girls don't like that shit fart here.  Girls?  Where are the girls?  There's two guys.  Very hot girls.  A couple of girls out there.  Hi, ladies.  Don't be shy.  There's definitely two girls, maybe three.  I'm not really sure.  Where's the third?  Oh, boy.  Exactly.  It's not a good...  Oh, let's say hi to Flea.  Hold on a second.  I want to talk to the fucking guy from the Geico commercial. 
[03:06:30]  The fucking...  He's looking around.  No, it's you, dude.  The guy that's looking around the most, it's you.  The caveman.  Right.  What do I look like, a gecko?  You can make fun of our audience there, Bob.  I would never...  They seem like...  Is he angry at me?  You're not mad at me, are you, sir?  Yeah, he's mad.  I look like a cave...  Really?  Yes.  Hello?  Well, you're very hairy.  Hold on, Flea.  Flea, you should know when to shut up when we're talking and when you're being hit by  a comedian. 
[03:07:00]  Yeah, a little bit.  You're very hairy.  It's okay, Frank.  No, I mean, I was, like, thinking about getting it cut.  Yeah.  Just getting a little raggedy around the sides and stuff.  A little bushy.  But, like, I have a knobby head, so I don't want to get it cut too short.  Oh, is that it?  A little bit shorter.  There's a line between what I have and what you have.  There's a way to balance it out.  But I've been there, though, and it looked really bad.  Yeah, but then don't go with the knobby, the crew cut.  Don't go with the crew cut.  I'm just saying you might want to take it back from Club Them and Rape Them in a Cave. 
[03:07:30]  Works for me, though.  And then the beard, you know, like, it's a big beard, too.  What do you do for a living?  He's at Oscar the Grouch at the Kmart.  I work in a chain bookstore, actually.  I don't know if I can say it or not.  Why not?  It's a bookstore you work at.  As long as it's not Barnes & Noble, you're on.  It is actually the first one.  Barnes & Noble?  Yeah, you're not allowed to mention Barnes & Noble on it.  I don't know.  Actually, I trained as a pro wrestler, too, somewhere that Bob in there actually did something  with. 
[03:08:00]  Bob?  What was it?  Bob, somehow you're tied to this guy now.  Let me see you.  Somehow.  Can you come more into the light?  Why?  He won't know me.  Were you on American Idol?  What?  No, I actually was not.  How am I tied to you?  Well, you're not tied to me, actually.  Right.  There's a wrestling thing.  You're kind of the commissioner of some time.  That's funny that you say that.  Somebody came up to me at the end of a show one night and said, look into the camera and  say, you're the commissioner of wrestling.  And I just set it into a camera. 
[03:08:30]  And this guy just put it on the web and says, I'm the commissioner of wrestling.  So everybody thinks I'm the commissioner of wrestling.  Yeah, I know that guy.  Sorry about that.  Yeah, that was weird.  It's not even true.  I just got hazed.  That is so funny.  You can just do anything these days and pop it up on YouTube.  Can we get one of those for our show?  Whatever you want.  What do we want?  That's how it happened last time.  I'm Batman.  The head of the FCC.  That's right.  The president of the Opie and Anthony show.  I'll do that.  We'll come up with something.  Wait, are you really a wrestler?  Do you really wrestle?  Well, I'm not yet.  I'm training.  He's training. 
[03:09:00]  I'm the commissioner of scrote.  What's your wrestling name?  Scroote.  Well, I don't have one.  I actually had people trying to tell me I should be like a grouchy gnome.  No, I'm serious.  I didn't make that up.  No, that's the problem.  What do you want your name to be?  What do you think?  You had to have thought this out.  You must have thought out wrestling names.  You have to.  It's part of that.  What are some of you thought out that you honestly don't know about yet?  Well, I was probably just going to use like a fake name, like just a name that's not mine.  Well, yeah, I didn't think you'd just be Ted.  You're like the wrestlers I'd want to talk.  You're like old.  It doesn't sound exciting when, you know, like Jimmy said, and now to the ring, here comes Ted. 
[03:09:30]  Hulk Hogan and Ted the guy.  No, but there isn't like a Ted the guy, though, so that could like work.  No, you don't have to.  What are you leaning toward?  Well, where I train, which is Chikara.  Chikara, the website is ChikaraWrestling.com.  I hope I don't get thrown out of here.  But you can't say Barnes & Noble.  No, never say Barnes & Noble.  No, as long as you say Chikara.  All right.  What are you trained to do?  You wrestle?  Yeah.  What wrestling name are you leaning towards? 
[03:10:00]  Come on.  Come on.  I'll be shy.  They already call me Crazy Frank on the tapes and stuff.  My name is Frank.  So Crazy Frank.  When I have to do something, like, Crazy Frank's all right.  Crazy Frank.  He's crazy.  Let's talk to Flea.  Thank you, sir.  Thank you, Crazy Frank.  Then I'd have to have, like, a little Fred Flintstone.  Get out.  Flea.  Like, white guy.  Hi.  Get out.  Hi, Flea.  Why do you represent the Opie and Anthony show by saying you're an intern for the show?  I didn't say I was an intern.  All right.  What did you say?  Okay. 
[03:10:30]  What did you say?  I said, look, I'm a big fan of the show.  And he said, I don't care who you work for.  Um, so you're saying that he misunderstood you.  Uh, and other people misunderstood you that heard?  It's a giant, it's, yeah.  I think when Mercurio said that, then people thought I said I was an intern.  Why'd you say, why'd you say you were an intern?  I didn't.  Why'd you confront him?  What happened?  It's just, it, it was pretty much, I've never seen the guy in person and I've just 
[03:11:00]  never liked him.  Okay.  So I just decided, why not?  I just felt like doing it.  But you didn't realize he was going to, like, beat you up, right?  Or were you hoping everyone was going to help you out?  No, see, I, a lot of people think I've thought that they were going to back me up in this.  No, this is all me.  Because I know that other people like him and it just, I didn't think he was going to hit  me and I learned my lesson.  How come people don't like you?  Yeah, why are you so unlikable? 
[03:11:30]  Because I'm a 19-year-old guy who likes Zach Tuff and then he got the, he got hit for  it.  You're saying that they wanted to see you get your comeuppance.  Flea, how much do you weigh?  About 135.  Ugh, Tops.  That's soaking wet with another man in your lap.  This is Bob Saget.  I think the first thing you got to do is change your name, dude.  Yeah.  Because it's saying, it's diminishing you.  That's true, Flea.  You should change it to Locust.  To something a little bigger.  He might as well.  He comes once every 17 years.  Nothing on that one? 
[03:12:00]  You can laugh.  You know why they're not laughing?  It's dangerous for the crops.  I thought that deserved something and I heard a titter.  I was like, all right, swing and a miss.  So you never said you interned for the O.B. and Anthony show?  No, I didn't.  Didn't.  No matter how many other people say that you said that.  Go ahead.  Fucking, everyone, I'm trying to at least be a little serious.  Can you stop my phone?  I hate that stupid gimmick that people try to do.  What do they do, Flea, that you don't like?  It's pound your phone and keep trying to call you. 
[03:12:30]  So all you hear is a beep.  I can barely hear you guys because people keep calling my phone.  Oh, yeah.  It is kind of distracting.  What are you talking about?  See, you said you're an intern on the O&A show.  Why did you say that?  Norton, I didn't say that.  But I mean, some people were saying you did and Mercurio said, I don't care who you work for.  Look, Mercurio hit me and I pretty much deserved it.  You what?  I can't hear you, dude.  He did what to you?  Mercurio hit me. 
[03:13:00]  Okay.  And you deserve it?  How many times did he hit you?  He hit me twice.  Where?  Shoulder.  Yeah, he said, he called me yesterday.  He said he could have really messed you up if he wanted to.  I'm sure he probably could have.  Flea, honestly, we're done with Paul, all right?  I know you're trying to do the right thing for the show, but we're so done with him.  And a little advice, you're going to get really hurt one of these days.  You've got to be careful.  You're a little boy.  I'm really sorry.  Honest to God. 
[03:13:30]  All right.  Cry.  Start crying.  It'll help your case.  Just start crying.  Hello?  What?  This is on?  Cry, Flea.  No, it's not worth it.  Someone is telling...  Hold on.  Hold on, Flea.  We may have a thing here.  Lamont.  Hey, what's up?  Hey, everyone is calling in, Flea, and saying that you said you were an intern.  You fucked up.  We just cleared the air.  We got Lamont on the line.  Lamont.  Dude, just come clean, man. 
[03:14:00]  You said it.  And another guy is on hold saying you said it as well.  And Paul Mercurio said that you either said you worked for the show or you were an intern  for the show.  I just think he might have misheard me and said that I worked for the show, but I never  said that.  Other people heard you say it too, my sweet.  Yeah, but wouldn't...  If you just said, I'm a fan of the show, like, everybody would have heard it that way.  They would have understood it that way.  It doesn't sound anything like an intern.  Anthony, there was even a guy named John who I think works for your show, works for the  show on the CBS side. 
[03:14:30]  He doesn't work there anymore.  He even was trying to call Flea out on it and be like, excuse me, you're an intern?  I never saw you before.  Did that happen, Flea?  No, I don't know who Lamont's talking about.  Who are you?  So this...  Lamont, I'm being totally serious.  I don't know who you're talking about.  Former child.  John, the guy...  Former child star?  Oh, former child star was...  Hey, Johnny.  Former child star, we know him.  That kid with the pretty eyes?  Yeah, he looks like a...  Wait, he wasn't...  He wasn't there on Wednesday.  What are you talking about? 
[03:15:00]  Look, this is getting too complicated.  You said it.  Why don't you just come clean?  It's...  Lamont, what the fuck is wrong with you?  With me.  With me.  You...  You...  You...  You stop shit.  And something's wrong with me?  Here he goes.  So, Lamont...  Lamont...  I don't get why you are jumping on his fucking...  Bandwagon.  What is the deal?  Why...  I've known you for about three years.  I don't get why you're fucking so pissed.  Because, dude, you do shit. 
[03:15:30]  And I didn't do anything to you.  I didn't do anything under anyone's fucking name.  I did it on my own.  I'm always labeled as fucking somebody else's thing.  Why can't I just be my own fucking guy?  Okay.  Okay.  I see a flea manifesto in his future.  Dude, we try to talk to you to just point you in the right direction.  Because, honestly, we love you.  Seriously.  But when you do shit like this to get attention, and when it's this much attention on you, you  don't like it all of a sudden. 
[03:16:00]  Ooh.  And then we try to tell you just to go the right way.  We don't want to control your life.  It's just...  You can't have stuff like that happen, dude.  It's not right.  Oh, shit.  Well, we're partly to blame, because we didn't really make it clear to everybody that we're  done with Paul.  But still, you're going to get really hurt one day.  Yeah, you're not big enough to, like, mouth off to people.  Yeah.  You've got to just accept that.  That's all I'm talking about.  Or not, you know, rich enough to have a lot of security around you at all times. 
[03:16:30]  And even if you become very rich and famous.  I just want to point that out.  Sorry.  Okay.  Never, ever leave a voicemail on a 12-year-old girl's cell phone.  Right.  That's the biggest lesson here.  Exactly.  Yeah, Lamont.  Thank you for putting up that voicemail.  Jesus fuck.  Well, you were calling me constantly during the show when I was trying to work.  Because you kept fucking texting me saying that I'm going to get, like, that they're calling  up other clubs about me and shit.  Calling up other clubs? 
[03:17:00]  The comedy seller got a call about him, actually.  Oh, yeah.  Because you were deemed a problem in a club?  Really?  And that's the way they work.  I only heard of the Laugh Factory.  No, Comedy Cellar, I guess, as well as Laugh Factory.  Huh.  Now, you see?  I was trying to warn you.  Am I wrong for doing that?  Am I hounding you?  I was trying to warn you.  That's what I did.  I could have said nothing.  Dude, you know, I told you.  I went to see Lewis on Thursday, and he said everything was fine.  Yeah, well, he called, apparently called the Comedy Cellar and, I guess, the Laugh Factory, 
[03:17:30]  according to Ope, so.  And I got a voicemail from Stand Up New York, but I haven't gotten back to him yet.  I don't know what that one's about.  Yeah, the clubs talk to each other.  Whenever they deem a customer a problem, it's just, it's a courtesy they extend to each other.  Exactly.  Hey, uh, would you take Pete's word there, Flea?  Hold on, Lamont, hold on.  We might need you again.  Here's Pete from Cringe Humor.  Uh, Pete.  Yeah.  He's fucking full of shit, dude.  He totally said it to him.  Right there in front of everybody, there's like at least five, six people that were listening. 
[03:18:00]  He fucking said that he was listening.  The only person who was listening was Lamont.  Hey, you weren't listening.  You were on your phone.  No, no, no, no.  I had my camera phone.  I was about to take a video.  Just as I'm about to fucking video, first of all, Paul thought I was, we were setting him up.  As he's fucking shoving Flea and punching him, he's saying, did you get the video footage that you wanted?  He said it a couple of times.  Because, you know, he, the way Flea set it up was that he was a setup, he was an intern from Opie and Anthony. 
[03:18:30]  That's what set Paul off.  Oh, boy.  No, that's not what fucking I said.  And what I said was you suck, and that's what got him mad.  And then he was like, oh, look, you know, you know, are you joking, are you joking?  I'm like, this fucking me, you're a fucking liar.  I didn't fucking represent anyone.  I said I'm an ONA fan, and I don't like how he got them fired for sex with Sam, and then it got blown up like that.  And you were on your phone, Pete.  Please don't lie about that shit.  Now he's calling you a liar.  Oh, shit.  Wow, I like how they turned that around.  You're a fucking liar.  You're a cancer on this whole fucking ONA community. 
[03:19:00]  Kill yourself.  Kill your fucking parents.  Jesus.  No, don't.  You're never fucking coming back on Cringe Humor, I'll tell you that.  You're never fucking coming back on.  I've never seen someone banned from so many message boards before.  I don't give a fuck that you started a fight.  I don't care that you called Paul.  I don't give a fuck what you did, but you're fucking lying.  That I give a fuck about.  Pete, I ain't mad.  Fine.  Sonny Ferrelli from Boston, also on the line. 
[03:19:30]  Oh, shit.  All right, let's hear from Sonny.  This is getting heavy.  Sonny Ferrelli.  Hey, guys.  Listen, I'm from Boston, so I don't have a chance to get out there all that much because, you know, I'm a working man.  But, you know, at the Christmas party, I thought he was a, I thought Flea was an intern.  He told me that at the Rod and Fez Christmas party.  He told you he was an intern?  Yeah, well, I was talking to him, you know, and he was all upset that he couldn't.  No, I didn't even say that, dude.  He was all upset that he couldn't get inside the Rod and Fez Christmas party because he was too young. 
[03:20:00]  And then, you know, he says, what do they think they are?  I mean, I mean, they're going to be torn, blah, blah, blah, blah.  Not Mercurio.  Flea, it's intervention time, man.  You've got to chill the fuck out.  You're going to get hurt.  You said you were an intern, Flea?  No, I didn't.  Why is that?  If you're going to lie about something, like, say you're an employee.  Yeah.  Why would you say you're an intern?  That's like the worst.  I had that impression that he was an intern up to now.  I thought he was always an intern.  Why don't you say I'm a bag of shit?  I mean, no disrespect to the interns. 
[03:20:30]  All right, Sonny, thank you.  You're welcome.  Everyone's calling Flea.  Don't hurt yourself or your parents.  So I'm just putting it out there.  Oh, of course.  Actually, Matt.  That's not right.  And then get some vag.  Bob, Matt from Cleveland, he wants you to sit down, Flea, and give him a full house sit-down talk.  Could you do that, maybe?  That's right.  Do you have any music?  Do you have any kind of full house music?  Oh, I got some, like, nice, sappy.  Let me just tell you something, Flea.  You're kind of like the daughter I always wanted. 
[03:21:00]  And, you know, I want you to not be so hard on yourself, to be honest with you.  You know, in life, things happen.  And sometimes you make mistakes.  I've made mistakes.  Whatever happened to predictability?  The milkman, the paperboy, they all tried to bugger me.  Well, let me tell you something.  As a father, I want you to forgive me.  I'm coughing up shit first.  And don't be so hard on yourself.  You know, this is supposed to be entertainment, this program. 
[03:21:30]  And so they're kind of making a sensationalism out of the drama you're going through.  And I know you feel the drama's real, because you're only a 19-year-old guy.  But this will so pass.  And you won't remember this when you're on that train and living as a drifter in Oklahoma.  You know, and you get that disease all around your ace hole.  Because some guy that you didn't know just kind of put it in there and you were asleep and passed out.  But don't hurt yourself.  No matter what you do, you can let a guy violate you all medicated and drunk on NyQuil.  Uncle Jesse, maybe. 
[03:22:00]  Uncle Jesse will do it up.  He'll put a mullet inside your ass.  You won't even know what happened.  I just want you to be careful.  And don't be hard on yourself.  This is supposed to be entertainment.  And try not to lie.  I used to lie for 30 years I lied.  And then I stopped fucking other people.  And I want you to just be forgiving of yourself, man.  And try not to be a liar and an asshole and a hunk of shit.  What a good fatherly speech.  Well, that's it.  Right from one of America's dads. 
[03:22:30]  Thank you all.  But I want to say one last thing.  I'm getting on a plane on Friday.  I am going to be...  I want you to wait for me, Flea.  I'm going to turn around on Saturday and I'm going to leave.  But when I come there, I'm going to parent you.  I'm going to straighten you out.  Because you've been acting like a little piggy.  And this little piggy went to market.  And that little piggy stayed home.  And that little piggy fabricated some stuff.  So I want you just to forgive yourself and stop being a little lying piggy.  And it's all going to be fine.  Flea is lying.  I guess.  But I don't know nothing.  I just show up to try to have fun with you guys. 
[03:23:00]  All right.  Doug out, Doug.  Flea's little custom username underneath his name on FBA.  It says O&A intern.  Really?  Flea?  What about that?  Flea?  Flea?  Comment?  Flea?  Hi, what?  Comment.  Does your name on FBA underneath your name say O&A intern?  No, it doesn't.  Hi, Doug.  There's not a single message board in the O&A community that agrees on anything. 
[03:23:30]  But every single one of these boards had somebody there that all heard him say he was an intern.  The members of the five boards were all represented.  Doug is a pimp.  They don't agree on anything.  But everybody heard this.  Doug, who from your board was on there?  Who from your board was there Wednesday?  Oh, shit.  I have no idea. 
[03:24:00]  I don't know.  No filter Paul was there.  No filter Paul was there.  No, he wasn't.  Oh, he wasn't there?  No.  No filter Paul.  He wasn't there?  No.  I just want to hear Flea cry.  He's the one that gave me the info.  All right.  Thank you, Doug.  I think this audio has to be pulled and given to Eastside Dave for board gossip.  There you go.  A little gossip.  A little cat. 
[03:24:30]  Is that what he says?  Oh, it's horrible.  Flea.  The song is awful.  Flea.  Flea.  Hi.  We'll give you the last word.  Sorry.  To who?  You're a powerful speaker, Flea.  I'm probably going to get hung up on, but...  Just say it, you mousy cunt.  I'm sorry I did that.  No, I'm...  I'm embarrassed that I did that.  What?  I've been an ass of myself.  Go ahead. 
[03:25:00]  All right.  It's just...  Sometimes I'm a bad boy, yeah.  Last words, anything...  Well, we're waiting.  Anything you want to say that might defend you or make you look a little better or...  I don't know.  My apologies to...  Shame.  Shame.  Shame.  Shame on you.  Anything?  I don't know.  My apologies to anyone involved. 
[03:25:30]  You're stupid!  Yeah.  No?  Nothing?  I'm...  I'm trying...  You lie!  You're a fucking liar!  Shut up!  Come on, Flea.  Something sincere from the heart, please.  I know.  Shut up!  Shut up!  I'm not good. 
[03:26:00]  I'm not good, Lord!  I have to do this now!  I'm just trying to hold it together.  Hold it together.  That's a good thing to do.  You are never to blame.  Is it video manifesto time?  Yeah.  It's not to that point, right?  I'm scared!  You dick!  Flea, something from the heart, please.  Not this...  This dreck. 
[03:26:30]  Yeah, come on.  Look, I just...  Stupid!  You're so stupid!  Why are you stopping?  You want to be a part of this radio program badly,  and yet we're giving you an opportunity to say something  that might ingratiate you to the program,  and all you're doing is flubbing and stuttering.  How about a real comment?  Here comes...  It's another SoundCliff time.  A.  A.  That's not what's happening. 
[03:27:00]  And D.  No, dickhole.  Exactly.  Just go with it, stupid.  I keep just trying to apologize.  I'm sorry.  I don't think anybody's loud.  I'm sorry.  I'm sorry.  Maybe an apology to Paul Mercurio.  Yeah, exactly.  How about an apology to Paul?  That's exactly what we wanted today.  Go ahead.  I...  Shut up!  Hey, I wrote him an email.  Yeah, did ya?  I was sorry! 
[03:27:30]  I did so many bad things!  Flea?  I want that one.  Flea, this is Greg Hughes, the actor that plays Opie on the Opie Network show.  Oh!  You really gotta be careful out there.  You're gonna get hurt.  I'm dead serious, alright?  We do wanna like you, but you gotta chill the fuck out.  And I know you're trying to do the right thing, but we're done with Paul.  Alright?  Okay, I'm really sorry.  Alright.  Son, all I've ever asked of my Marines is for them to obey my orders as they would 
[03:28:00]  the Word of God.  Word of God.  Word of God.  Alright, Flea.  You look like assholes right now, man.  Have a good weekend, alright?  Wait, wait.  Thank you.  Oh, wait, but Flea, hold on.  Quick question, Flea.  Have a good big case.  We're not hanging up on you here.  I'm looking at your profile picture, and it says Flea Man, and it says ONA intern under...  What is this from, Hawk?  From Full Blown AIDS.  This is from FullBlownAids.com, it says Flea Man, ONA intern under it.  Now, what you just said that you don't have that there.  Flea. 
[03:28:30]  Flea.  Flea.  Are you a compulsive liar?  No, what are you even talking about?  On your profile, on FBA, it says Flea Man, and then it says ONA intern under it.  You know how you put your little comment under your name on a message board?  I think you know about message boards, Flea.  Yeah, and Doug is an administrator, so he can always change it.  Ah, conspiracy theory.  That's very conspiracy.  I like it, man.  All right. 
[03:29:00]  You know something?  I kind of believe Doug would do an asshole move like that.  Of course he would.  I actually think Doug dressed up as Flea and yelled at Mercurio.  All right, we got to go, Flea.  We got a big star in studio.  You've had enough of this bunk.  Flea, take care of yourself, man.  My apologies to all you guys.  I didn't mean for any of this shit to be like as big as it was.  Well, it morphed into something, and now they're talking about it in fucking Chicopee,  and there's going to be a big showdown tonight at the Hooky Loo at 1030.  That's a town meeting now. 
[03:29:30]  Yeah, it's a big town meeting.  There's going to be a big fight, a good mouth fuck.  I mean, who cares about tickets?  So did you apologize to Paul?  Yeah, I wrote him a long email about it.  Briefly, because it's on the air, we'd like to hear it.  So briefly, just at least a little piece of it, just a little apology to Paul.  All right, Paul.  Sorry for being...  There you go.  Shut up.  Take your email and fucking shove it up your little dumper.  Like I give a shit.  All right, punk.  Tickets going very well for the ONH virus comedy show there, Jimmy. 
[03:30:00]  Ticketmaster.com if you want tickets for the tour dates, okay?  What's wrong?  Fucking text from my girlfriend.  Oh.  What?  What horse shit.  I love you.  XOXO.  Is this the girlfriend I met?  Jesus.  Fuck you.  But that's nice.  All right, hey.  That's a bunch of bullshit.  Jimmy, push the Ticketmaster, will you?  Tickets are going very well, though, right now.  Yeah, they are.  Bob Sag is playing like six or seven of the cities, 
[03:30:30]  which is very cool.  Our sweet Bob Sag, he'll be playing in Wonton, New York.  He'll be playing in the Mohegan Sun.  Wonton, New York is Jones Beach.  June the 16th, Mohegan Sun, June the 30th.  Bob is not at that one.  Tweeter Center in Boston, June 21st.  Or is that July?  July 21st.  Detroit, Michigan, August 4th.  Bob Sag will be there, along with Carlos Mencia and Louis C.K.  And Otto and George.  Otto.  The Nissan Pavilion in Bristol, Virginia for the D.C. market, 
[03:31:00]  August the 18th.  Bob will be there, along with Mencia and Louis C.K.  and Otto and Patrice and Voss and me.  And Fat Bob Kelly.  PNC Arts Center in Holmville, August 25th.  Embarrassingly over with Bob Kelly,  with really rich and famous Bob Saget,  and kind of sounds like the guy Frank Caliendo.  And bad third, Mike Jim Norton,  along with finally comes back Louis Black.  One hit wonder, Louis C.K.  Fucking angry at all of us, Otto and George.  Bridge burning Patrice O'Neal.  And fucking retard, stiff-handed Voss. 
[03:31:30]  That's on the Twitter Center in Camden, September the 15th.  Bob will be there, too,  as long as Bob Kelly and Otto and Louis and myself and Patrice.  Very good.  Sillymaster.com.  Yes.  Very impressive.  More with Bob Saget when we get back,  and we'll wrap up the show,  and we got your boogie, and I don't know.  Let's go.  We'll be right back. 
[03:32:00]  We'll be right back. 
[03:32:30]  We'll be right back. 
[03:33:00]  We'll be right back.  We'll be right back.  We'll be right back.  We'll be right back.  We'll be right back.  We'll be right back.  We'll be right back.  We'll be right back.  I'm not saying he has to come in, but he's... 
[03:33:30]  Sergeant Magoo, everybody.  It's the XM Satellite Radio Show.  Hi, Sergeant Magoo.  Yeah, Sergeant Magoo.  How are you?  Sir?  What's happening?  Good to see you.  That's Bob Saget.  Good to see you, sir.  Bobby Bainati over here.  Who's this?  Bobby Bainati from FBA.  Natty!  Hi, Natty.  And he's a Marine.  That's right.  Both are, yes.  Hoorah!  Yeah, I know, Sergeant Magoo's a Marine.  Of course he is.  He ate his own vomit and assed for seconds.  Exactly.  Just like Joker said he would.  What kind of shirts do you have for us?  The boys have gifts.  We've got the...  We always talk about how you have the cop shirts, the FBI shirts, all that good stuff. 
[03:34:00]  Yes.  So we figured...  Why have a funny FBI female body inspector?  Oh, that's a hoot.  We figured we gotta get you guys some Marine Corps shirts to sport around.  Oh, yeah.  We got you guys a couple shirts that...  I like wearing those on the plane, so when something goes wrong, they all look at you  for help, and you're like, I just got the shirt, asshole.  Yeah, exactly.  Anthony, since you're very big with the rifles, we got you this one.  It says, uh...  Nice.  You can run, but you'll die tired.  U.S. Marine Corps sniper.  I love it.  I'm gonna wear that when I just shoot people at random. 
[03:34:30]  There you go.  Nice, man.  Nice, creepy shirt.  Give me that, Jimmy, you fuckwad.  And by fuckwad, I mean shit dick.  Since Melinda was so kind to help us out with getting this stuff, we got her a one-two.  Oh, look at that.  Chicks dig the Marine.  Keep proud of us away from that.  That's good.  So there you go.  You can get that, too.  That's good.  In a teen size.  That's a wonderful thing.  Perfect.  We ordered women's size.  I know.  It's wonderful.  Thank you, Doug, for calling me.  Ooh, I hope I'm next.  Ooh.  Ooh.  Yes, for Opie, we don't promise you a Rose Garden with a drone instructor yelling at a recruit. 
[03:35:00]  Ooh.  Hey, that's pretty sweet.  That's angry.  He certainly is.  I don't like that type of talk.  Yeah.  Appreciate it.  They ought to get sensitive in the Marines.  Absolutely.  They're hurting people's feelings, though.  Jim, you'd play a good Marine in a movie.  It'd be very funny.  Oh, thank you.  I'd play a good guy getting fucked in the ass in Biloxi Blues.  Is that what it's called?  Yes.  All right, good.  I thought I fucked that reference up.  No, good.  For Jim, it's one on the back.  It's a quote from Eleanor Roosevelt.  It says, uh...  Whose cunt is that?  I want to eat it.  Really?  Really?  The Marines I have seen around the world have the cleanest bodies, the filthiest minds, 
[03:35:30]  the highest morale, and the lowest morals of any group of animals I have ever seen.  Thank God for the United States Marine Corps.  Oh, nice.  I didn't get to see that.  I didn't get to see the...  There's the quote on the back.  Wow.  Eleanor Roosevelt, 1945.  Ever since my hubby's been in this chair, he can't get a boner.  Exactly.  Oh, look, another quote by Eleanor Roosevelt.  Thanks for the new shoes.  What the hell is he supposed to do with these?  They said he fucked around on her. 
[03:36:00]  Yeah?  How do you do it if you're in a wheelchair and you can't get a...  Absolutely.  You've got to finger someone real quick while she's not looking.  Eleanor, look, and you can fucking jam two fingers up the nurses in the skirt.  And since Poe is a killer of all sorts, I got him this one.  It's a one mind, any weapon, Marine Corps martial arts program, which he...  Oh, wow.  That's a pretty cool shirt.  That's a very nice one.  Poe got a good one.  That's a good shirt.  And Bob Saget?  For Bob Saget.  Oh, boy, you pulled this one out of your house, Tom.  I actually like that.  State of excitement, 5.56 millimeter, which is the M16.  I'm taking the kids to school with that one. 
[03:36:30]  And a 7.62 millimeter, which is an M14 rifle.  Thank you very much.  Is that the one that Poe had?  One, Poe put right in his mouth around the back there.  7.62 millimeter.  Oh, thank you, man.  That's very nice to you.  What are the other ones?  I don't see them being displayed.  Well, for Brett and Elmo, since they were kind enough to help us out with other things also.  Well, let's see Brett and Elmo's shirts.  We may have to do a little training.  My brother's Bob Saget.  For Elmo, U.S. Marine.  We don't suffer from insanity.  We enjoy every minute of it.  Okay, he can have that one.  That's perfect for him, man. 
[03:37:00]  That's great.  And for Brett.  Yeah, I want to just cross K-bars on the front and cross K-bars on the back.  Oh, wow, yeah.  Nice.  Yeah, that's nice.  My dad was a Marine in the 60s.  Thank you.  And then he had his own shirt made.  It said, don't ask, don't tell.  I was proud of Dad.  Did you guys hear what John McCain did?  No, I did not.  That's a nice segue, isn't it?  Ah.  There you go.  That's pretty good.  Thank you, boys, very much for our shirt.  It's well documented that we have, for quite a long time now,  known where the real problem is in the Middle East. 
[03:37:30]  And, in fact, the president adequately described it as the axis of evil.  So, I guess my question is, how many times do we have to prove that these people are blowing up people?  Now, never mind if they get a nuclear weapon, when do we send them an airmail message to Tehran?  That old Beach Boys song, Bomberan? 
[03:38:00]  Bom, bom, bom, bom.  Hey, man.  Oh, Jesus.  That's John McCain.  Oh, Jesus.  That just cost him the election.  Yep, right there.  That just cost him the election.  You don't want to be a president sighing.  Good job.  First thing, it's a royalty.  Yeah, right?  He's got to pay royalties.  Bom, bom, bom, bom, bom, Moran.  Sounded like a lunatic.  It's like every fucking 1980s movie where they make the commandant of the military academy look nutty.  He just, bom, bom, dancing and bombing and dancing and bombing.  Well, way to go, John.  You just threw it out. 
[03:38:30]  That's it.  It's only seven minutes before the, you know, well, it's two years before.  Yeah.  But it feels like it.  We've got to weed him out quick, but that's insane.  Yeah, that's it.  Goodbye.  He's done.  There goes one of them.  He's done.  What world are we in here?  CNN has Alex Baldwin's picture on it today.  I mean, for a voicemail.  A voicemail.  For his voicemail.  And good segue.  Speaking of voicemail, let me get mine up here and running because I want to play this little tidbit that came in.  Check the time stamp on this, too. 
[03:39:00]  All right.  I want to listen to my messages.  God, I hope it's another message by accident.  You've been getting, like, prank?  You've been getting, like, prank stuff?  No, no.  Just talk amongst yourselves.  Get to the point where you can't leave a message on a girl's machine.  It's, you know, like Pat O'Brien did.  You can't leave a message.  Oh, that's our favorite one ever.  Nothing will ever beat those voices.  Third party, and we're going to do a lot of coke.  I mean, that's nice stuff.  Me, you, Betsy. 
[03:39:30]  Won't be any minute now.  Oh, we can hear the phone numbers.  We can hear the phone numbers.  No, I just, I'm erasing them.  Jim, do you ever want to bang that recording lady on all these phones?  Oh, yeah.  Oh, here's right.  Here we go.  No one can hear that.  Damn it.  Damn it.  Stupid phone.  All that for nothing.  See, that's why I don't understand why I'm being sued.  What?  Exactly. 
[03:40:00]  I couldn't hear anything.  Who called you?  Ah, it's, okay, now I got, God damn it.  Jimmy keeps trying to call me, but I wouldn't go through.  I hit ignore.  Go to speaker, no?  You boned.  I don't know how to go to speaker on my phone.  I never go to speaker.  What's the message?  Here was the problem.  At 11.30 last night.  11.30 last night.  What time?  11.30.  What?  When I have to get up at an ungodly hour to do this program.  I get a call, and I didn't pick it up, because I'm trying to sleep, and it left a voicemail. 
[03:40:30]  So I check it this morning, 11.30 at night.  It's XM Satellite Radio recording, selling me on XM Satellite Radio.  It was, now here I am, trying to sleep so I could get up and do a show for XM Satellite Radio, and they're trying to sell me XM Satellite Radio, and I think they mentioned the Opie and Anthony show.  So they're trying to sell me me, meanwhile, they're ruining the show by waking me up. 
[03:41:00]  It's like Truman Show shit.  It really was weird.  And everybody knows you subscribe to Sirius.  I do.  I have to.  I have a Ford.  They're laughing, Jimmy.  They're laughing.  You guys have a vacation coming or something?  Yeah.  You can tell, right?  Yeah.  Oh, it's just so obvious.  We're minutes away from vacation time.  I'm honored to be here before you're sprung.  And we'll be in Miami in no time.  If you want real humor, go to your show tonight. 
[03:41:30]  Oh, look at you.  That's where you're going to get the laughs.  That's right.  North Fork Theater tonight, Westbury.  Tickets still available?  Yeah, I think so.  It's got thousands of people in it, and it's in the round, so you can see my anus and my sack and my tink.  Yeah, and then you see your balls.  Yeah, yeah.  And then your hip and then your anus again.  Yeah, people actually sit under the stage.  And I scat on them.  They're the taint seats.  They're the whole show.  The taint seats, and I smear it all over them.  That's wonderful.  Yeah, I make them a Rorschach out of their face, out of my own feces.  Would you just drop a big fucking roast beef?  I'm going to roast beef and carrots and potatoes. 
[03:42:00]  Would you mind if I put out a request to the ONA fans to give you a warm ONA welcome when you hit the stage?  You mean the you suck thing?  No.  It's so painful.  No, they could do something better than that.  Don't do that.  Well, Flea will do that.  Flea will yell, you suck, and say he's the president of CBS.  Asshole.  You suck makes no sense, because it throws me off for a quarter of a second.  Yeah.  And I smile.  I don't really care.  They usually run on stage naked and rub their ball bags all over your body really fast.  No, it's a sign of affection.  That's just the women.  In fact.  It's not gay. 
[03:42:30]  No.  They're just...  Can I tell you some comment?  It's called the you lucky devil welcome.  If they can Purell the ball bag, but I don't really think it's...  They would prefer you Purell their ball bag for them.  I'm not going to handjack the audience.  If you use Purell and touch a guy's ball bag, is it that bad?  Because it's...  No, you're cleaning the cock.  It's clean.  It's stupid, because you're wiping off the oniony goodness.  Why else do you smell balls?  What's the use of smelling a man's balls if you can't have onion on your face afterwards?  You goose.  Is it always onion?  Of course it is.  I've never smelled onion on my balls. 
[03:43:00]  Oniony ball bag.  I can tell what exercise a gentleman has done.  I can tell what exercise a gentleman has done by the way his balls smell.  If they smell like Munster, I'll say 22 minutes on the bike.  Hey, I got to communicate from someone in the know.  K-L-L-I-G-M David Henry out of Dallas told R&R, O&A did a great job for us.  We just felt the need to develop a more local show.  I didn't think it was anything personal.  Oh, was that it?  That's their official statement coming out of Dallas today. 
[03:43:30]  Five to eight we were on.  We had a tough spot there.  I mean, it's just, if we were on, like, full drive time live, I would have a major problem  with it.  But I really think that five to eight is a very tough place and that his other show might  have been suffering.  Don't.  Here's our official statement.  We left because of that Kennedy thing.  That's right.  That'll show them.  And the fact that all of a sudden everybody's drinking out of the same fountain and we didn't  care for that.  You guys all right out there?  Anything you want to add?  Get on the chat.  That's quite a group.  Everyone's good. 
[03:44:00]  We should have the truth.  I got fired for saying your mom's box.  Hold on.  You got fired for saying your mom's box?  The man with Eric Logan's barber.  Let's talk to him.  Jimmy, I was going to go with the Down Syndrome.  I think the same thing.  That's the reason you should have been fired.  That's good.  Good job, Jimmy.  Go ahead.  Why?  Well, because I was a radio DJ in Pennsylvania and you guys know how backdoor radio politics  work.  And a few people didn't like me.  So on my show the other day, I said, your mom's box.  They came in, cut my show off midstream, then made me stay till the end of my shit. 
[03:44:30]  Sir, don't try to relate to us.  We're so much bigger than you.  It's embarrassing.  Yeah.  What kind of radio show did you do?  It was a music station.  What kind of music?  Kelly Clarkson kind of crap.  Yeah.  Did you a favor.  How about the fan out there with the Baby Gap sweatshirt on, holding the microphone?  Baby Gap.  We're talking about our own Sam.  How old are you?  I got Baby Gap sweatshirt.  Candy in my head. 
[03:45:00]  I love you.  My jacket.  It's my hoodie.  Baby Gap.  It's got guns, knives, and money bags on it.  All right.  The Baby Gap in Beirut or Palestine.  No.  Palestine.  Or uptown.  How old am I?  That sweatshirt's really in, though.  It's very good.  I saw the I Love New York reunion.  They were all wearing it there, Sam.  So you're on to something.  I know what I'm doing.  No, you don't.  What was your radio name?  Cliff Hart was my radio name.  Do you know how to talk up records?  Yeah.  What can you talk up for us? 
[03:45:30]  What do you got?  Give us a song.  Yeah, something.  Some kind of...  We got the master computer.  What was on your list?  Kelly Clarkson, Rob Thomas, all that kind of...  All right.  What's Rob Thomas?  Smooth opinion, whatever it's called.  Smooth.  Yeah.  All right.  You got smooth.  And turn up the speakers out there so the guy...  You can hear us?  Yeah, I can hear you.  All right, good.  Danny's working on it.  He's finding...  This is going to be good for his reel.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Exactly.  Dan giving us a thumbs up.  Here he goes. 
[03:46:00]  XM Satellite Radio.  It's Cliff Hart hanging out with the Open Anthony Show.  Out in the audience today.  Got a little Rob Thomas cranking for you out in the city.  Before you head on out of the building to get to your day-to-day, you guys, enjoy vacation.  Oh.  That's pretty good.  That's not bad.  He had a lot of...  He had a lot of...  And he's on the spot.  He's a young man.  Why don't we do it again?  Just work in the...  I like to suck cock.  And take your cock out.  Professional DJ.  Have it in your hand.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Intro on this, but just work in it.  I love cock or whatever.  Okay. 
[03:46:30]  All right.  Okay.  Let her write again.  Cliff Hart, XM Satellite Radio, hanging out in the audience today.  Open Anthony Show.  Got fired for staying in your mom's box because I love the cock.  Rob Thomas.  I love the cock.  But I love Rob Thomas' cock.  Yeah.  You didn't put enough emotion in the love of the cock.  Didn't put enough emotion?  I think you should end with, I love the cock.  Okay.  Like some blah, blah, blah, blah.  I love the cock.  And then you have the music box.  Yeah, make it sound believable because I know you don't want to be introing these records,  but you made it believable on your show, right?  Right.  Yeah, you got to pretend like you can. 
[03:47:00]  Make it all about the cock.  And hit the post, you hack.  Yeah.  Jesus.  All about the cock.  Rob Thomas.  Vacation.  XM Satellite Radio.  Take three.  Cliff Hart, XM Satellite Radio.  Open Anthony Show.  Going on vacation.  And I love the cock.  If I could suck Rob Thomas' cock right now, I'd get a big mouthful.  All right.  That's good.  That's pretty good.  Very good.  What's your mother's cell phone number?  Was that believable enough?  That was good, yes.  That was good.  Was that Santana or Rob Thomas? 
[03:47:30]  Both.  Oh, okay.  I don't know who Rob Thomas is.  It's Santana, but he doesn't sing.  Why would he?  He plays the guitar.  So he gets all the credit for not singing.  He's fucking awful.  All right.  Anyone else out there?  Anyone else?  Who was his big song?  Who?  The old one?  Oh, yeah.  Come over.  Oh, hey.  Come over.  Oh, that fucking song is horror.  Black Magic Woman.  Another shitbox song.  Anybody else out there?  I just want to say it's my birthday.  Oh, happy birthday.  Who old are you? 
[03:48:00]  I'm 31.  No one cares.  Would you like to touch bare bottoms with Jimmy for your birthday?  What's that?  Would you like to touch bare bottoms with Jimmy for your birthday?  No.  Come on.  It's a birthday gift.  What are you, queer?  Get in here.  We'll touch asses.  A couple of men fucking on your birthday.  That's how you straighten everything out.  Who wants to do some bare bottom touching?  How about the two girls right here?  They're both lovely.  Well, let's say hi to them.  Don't be shy, miss.  Walk by that aunt.  All right.  What are your names? 
[03:48:30]  I'm Jeannie.  Hi, Jeannie.  Boyana.  Boyana?  Just go right ahead.  I've heard them all.  Have you?  Yeah.  Like what?  That's a cunt name.  I wasn't going to say that, but she challenged me.  You had to pick one she probably never heard.  I'm sorry, Boyan.  I don't mean that.  No.  My college roommate freshman year was fascinated with my name, but she couldn't remember it.  And none of the other girls on my floor could.  So she devised a little sing song. 
[03:49:00]  And it all revolved around a boy on a bike, a boy on a horse, a boy on a something to remember  my name.  Sorry.  No, what was the song?  I want to know what the song was.  Oh, I don't really remember the tune.  That's a pretty name.  What nationality are you?  Croatian.  Oh, a Croat.  Nice.  I like a girl who has hair on the top of her toes.  Do you have a...  Go.  I was going to say, I shaved mine off before I came.  You're a pretty girl.  You have a suck a guy's cock?  You have a fella?  Show me how you suck a guy's cock. 
[03:49:30]  The last time I'm going to ask you.  Jesus.  Sounds angry.  Who is that?  Boyan is a very nice name.  That was from Bad Lieutenant.  Yes.  Harvey Keitel.  Thank you.  And how about your lovely friend with the blonde hair?  Hi, madam.  Hi.  How are you, Jimmy?  Oh, where are you from?  I'm here.  New York.  Upper East Side.  Oh, cool.  I'm from the Upper West Side.  Maybe we can meet Central Park and just jerk off.  Did you...  When?  Wow.  Fucking 11-8. 
[03:50:00]  11-8.  11-8.  Good improv skills.  11-8.  What a nervous asshole.  I talk to a chick and I fucking flub and fall apart.  11-8.  Kenny was telling me I got to go.  He's pointing and...  We got to get Anthony out of here.  He's got a plane of cat.  Are you flying today?  Yes, I am.  Have a safe trip.  I'll be in sunny Miami.  Have a safe trip.  It's great to see you.  Say hi to my ex-in-laws.  I will.  Absolutely.  You look great, man.  Thanks.  So do you.  No, I mean you got a nice cock.  That's what I meant.  Yeah. 
[03:50:30]  I'm sorry.  Anthony is all cock.  Is that true?  No, it's disgusting.  All cock.  No talk.  It's a big Italian mess.  It is.  I told the cock story.  Dinty more can.  He's got something on it.  I'm still working on the smell of onions.  I can't get over that.  Jimmy's oniony bag.  Anthony doesn't shave his pubes either.  It's fucking...  Just picture a blood sausage in a shrub.  No one look at Anthony's cock when he walks out of here.  Don't look at my cock.  No, I pointed it out before because I was wearing light pants and I was happy that I didn't get 
[03:51:00]  any dribble when I pissed because when you wear light pants, the slightest little dribble  and everyone will just...  Do you have leakage?  Well, no, but you know, if you're in a hurry and you're doing a radio show, you got to make  sure you get back before you're on the air.  You got to pull your dick in and oh, fuck.  And then it's just like out there.  I've done that before where I've then washed my hands and splashed my shirt really badly  and gone, fucking sink.  Yeah.  In there.  Ah, God.  I was in a hurry so bad one time I pissed all over my hands.  I was washing my hands in my own piss. 
[03:51:30]  Yeah, that's another thing.  And then I soaked my cock in the sink and my hands were covered in piss.  I was like opposite day.  That's stupid.  It's like when you use preparation age instead of toothpaste and your mouth hemming.  Yeah.  It was up.  And then Crest just burns your asshole.  Crest burns your asshole, but your asshole smells great.  Yeah.  You talk with your ass the rest of the day.  For people when they feel their teeth in your asshole.  All right, Dan.  I'm sorry.  Have a safe trip.  Bye.  Maybe I should put the sniper shirt on before I get on the plane.  Cut it out.  That's wrong.  Hide your cock when you walk out of here.  It's always scared me when there's a giant audience. 
[03:52:00]  There we go.  They're very nice.  They're very, very nice.  Look how ashamed Anthony is of his cock.  That's right.  I'm ashamed of my giant cock.  You can't cover that with a vest, can you, kid?  Bye, Akak.  Have fun at the old Westbury Music Fair.  Was it North Fork?  Thank you.  North Fork tonight.  We'll talk to you soon, man.  Have a great trip.  Thank you, Drew.  Yes, I will.  Are you covering peace spots right now?  Oh, yeah, I am.  I'll give you a call.  I've got my satellite phone. 
[03:52:30]  I'll call you from the ocean.  See, we really are friends off the air.  Dan.  Bye, love.  I'll miss you.  All right.  Hoodie.  Oh, darn.  By the way, I want something from, I want something from my, I want something from Miami.  Hey, can we follow Anthony all the way to his car again?  Just follow him outside, Sam.  Okay.  Bye.  We're going to have a copy.  Shut up.  This is hilarious.  Someone do an Anthony impression and read the fucking copy because it ain't going to be me.  All right, hold on.  Let me do an Anthony impression.  Down with the Jews. 
[03:53:00]  All right, we got to, just follow Anthony.  We got a line of the day.  Jimmy is so funny.  No.  I'm not doing it.  Doing what?  I can't.  He won't.  He's Anthony.  I've got to go.  Earl Douglas, ladies and gentlemen.  Earl Douglas.  Boom.  That was more than Earl deserved.  Ah, and here I am, walking out.  I'm leaving the show before it's over.  You're insane.  I'm sorry, Dave.  I'm meeting him in the hallway.  It's like celebrities out here.  How you doing, sir?  Congratulations on your cruise. 
[03:53:30]  Thank you.  Thank you.  Great.  What?  Is this going on the air?  Yes, Dave.  I didn't know this was on the air.  Oh, fuck.  Talking to that end.  Fuck it.  And, uh, I actually, I want to say, uh, congratulations on your upcoming nuptials.  Thank you.  I'm very, uh, happy for you.  Thank you very much.  You have a beautiful woman there.  You've always been there for me.  Well, I mean, the last couple weeks.  At the beginning, I thought you were a complete fucking douchebag.  Right.  I hated you.  All right, well, then the last month, you've been there for me.  Last week, like, maybe a couple of days. 
[03:54:00]  Days.  Something like that.  But the last 48 hours, you've really been there for me.  Yeah, two days.  Okay.  Let's go with two days.  I've been there.  Uh, take it.  Kenny's yelling at you.  All right.  Now, if I'm late, it's your fault.  Oh, the elevator.  Uh, Sam?  Hey, Sam?  Hi.  Yeah.  Oh, it's a crowded elevator.  We got Sam.  We're going to have Sam on the phone, too.  Anthony leaving the show.  Going down.  Ha ha, everybody.  A lot of the days brought to you by Bodogfight.com, by the way.  Um, yeah. 
[03:54:30]  Oh, fourth floor.  Good.  It's going to stop on every floor.  Oh, yes, sir.  Get up.  We're getting cut out.  Yeah.  No, we'll get him after he gets off the elevator.  All right.  We got some runner-up lines of the day.  Here's the first one from Bodogfight.com.  For Jim, it's, uh, one on the back.  It's a quote from Eleanor Roosevelt.  It says, uh, where's cunt is that?  I want to eat it.  There you go.  Runner-up line of the day.  Oh, take care.  Have a good day.  Goodbye, doll.  People have to get off on every floor.  Ha ha ha ha ha ha.  We're going to do two.  See, you couldn't do this on regular radio, Bob. 
[03:55:00]  This is awesome.  I love this shit.  Thank you for having me.  Sam?  Actually, I'm thinking I'm just shit myself.  Sam?  All right.  Take care.  All right.  Oh, now he's in the...  All the way.  Steve, you're waiting.  My vacation's starting.  My vacation is starting.  Right now, sir.  Goodbye.  Jimmy Norton hates you.  He called you a pile of shit with a tie on it. 
[03:55:30]  The funniest part is that he fucked in an Elo in the fucking hallway.  I hope that went out.  I don't have headphones or anything.  That's the line of the day.  How are you doing, sir?  Serious satellite radio, right?  Okay.  Oh.  Oh, my God.  That's great.  We told Sam.  Morpheus is sitting in my truck.  There he goes.  Oh, oh, oh.  And we could get hit by a truck.  Oh, no. 
[03:56:00]  Oh.  Are they looking at me out the window?  Thank you, Master Poe.  Safe trip, Anthony.  Thank you, Master Poe.  Take care.  All right.  Have a great time, man.  Thank you, Kenny and Sam.  You want me to take the mic and drive and see how far the fucking range is, you asshole?  Sam's getting in the car with you.  Now, hold on.  Hold on.  Can he hear us?  Yeah.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Oh, good.  Thank you, Master Poe.  Now, I'm going to annoy you like a caller. 
[03:56:30]  Thank you, Kenny.  Hello?  Hello?  Am I on the air?  I can drive and see how the fucking range is.  Am I on the air?  I'm getting in the car.  Oh, shut the fuck up, you savage.  See?  Goddamn cab drivers.  This is the real one.  I wish I could take this mic with me.  I am going to be hot to get home.  All right.  Take care.  Have fun.  I'm driving away with the microphone.  All right.  Get out of here.  Are you really gone? 
[03:57:00]  Someone call Anthony's phone.  Sam?  Oh, my God.  Yeah.  What happened?  He's in his car now.  He's driving away.  He's driving away?  Yeah.  We winded you in the car with him.  What?  He's gone now.  All right.  Someone call his phone.  We'll get him back on in a second here.  Those were the runner-up lines of the day?  Oh, we got one more runner-up line of the day.  Here it is, thanks to bodogfight.com.  This is what we try to tell people last week.  We're like, Imus used to take more abuse than he did before. 
[03:57:30]  And then he dished out.  Yeah.  He used to beat him up on a regular basis.  I saw Kitty Carlisle live the other day, and I saw the picture of the paper.  But for a minute, I thought it was...  There you go.  Rob Bartlett with a runner-up line of the day.  He had a better line.  He had a lot better lines.  Like when he came on the air and started screaming.  That was a fucking great line.  He started doing Alex Baldwin's thing.  The staff, they're tired, too.  That's a vacation run.  And there was another line he had that was really funny about how he looked.  I think as far as the day before vacation, we did a fine job today.  Usually, it's a lot worse than this. 
[03:58:00]  Where are you guys going?  Oh, I can't tell you that, Bob.  Where exactly?  I'm going to Schenectady.  Really?  Yeah.  You're going to spend the whole time there at a resort there of some kind?  No, I'm taking a trip.  It's called to Girlfriend's Pussy Town.  Right.  For the next two weeks, brutally.  You ever make a snuff film with her?  I would love to.  Excuse me.  Excuse me.  Anthony's on the phone.  Hi, Ant.  I'd best not get pulled over because I'm using a cell phone illegally.  How's your vacation going?  That's the least of our...  I'm relaxing on a beach. 
[03:58:30]  I have a banana daiquiri.  That's the least of our problems, by the way.  Didn't you read the New York Times today?  All right.  Hello?  I lost you.  Sorry.  I hope you lost me.  Jimmy...  This was just like that fucking cell phone commercial, I hope.  Jimmy, did you hear that I told the guy downstairs?  Yeah, we heard it.  Yeah, I was rolling.  I wasn't sure.  I was rolling.  I was going out.  Good.  Now he knows.  And then I tried to improv after, and it got less than a zero. 
[03:59:00]  When you said, Jimmy, he says you're a piece of shit, I improv'd.  Wow, who knew Elo was in the hall?  And it got nothing twice.  See, there was a secret part of me.  Let me break the wall for the audience.  I was hoping they just didn't hear it, but they did.  And hold on.  Okay.  I had to soak in that for a second.  How's the traffic there, buddy?  I'm making my way across town.  Not bad right now, but over by Park, it gets a little silly, and I have to really get offensive. 
[03:59:30]  I practice offensive driving, because when you're in a city with cab drivers that are  all just really, well, you know.  Hey, can we keep the channel on with you just driving home?  Maybe you can crank up the radio and sing along as you're driving.  Oh, and see what I do on my normal drive home?  Yeah, it doesn't even matter if it's good.  All right, let me see if I could...  All right, figure out what you want to listen to on the way home, and we'll just have the  channel on.  It'll be Anthony driving home.  People will listen just for the hell of it. 
[04:00:00]  All right, figure it out.  We're going to do line of the...  Yeah, well, Farner, I'm psyched.  I'm on vacation.  All right, hold on.  We're going to get to you in a sec.  Here's line of the day, thanks to Bodogfight.com.  Here comes the line of the day, line of the day, line of the day. 
[04:00:30]  I wound up making it.  I kind of made it.  Oh, okay.  It was close.  You might have ruined something.  I gave birth to a pot roast.  Did that make it out over the general airways?  Yeah, I believe so, yeah.  All right. 
[04:01:00]  By the way, the new 2007 virus, O&H Island virus t-shirts are on sale at MyRadioStore.com.  Very cool.  Nice.  Anthony's on vacation.  He's singing along in his car.  I'm completely punchy now.  I know.  Well, this is what we do to people.  Fucking fun.  Bob Saget's going to be at the North Forks Theater in Westbury tonight.  We're going to that show.  Jimmy's going to be in Chickapé.  At the Comedy Connection in the Hookie Lou in Chickapé.  One show tonight at 10.30 due to the complete and justifiable lack of interest. 
[04:01:30]  Right.  Do you take a big pot roast at the end?  Yes, I might as well.  I'll make it look like it's an audience member.  Fucking empty room it's going to be.  You should take it home and fuck it.  Well, then I wouldn't be an audience member.  So I'm going to see you guys.  I'll be talking to you, but I'll be seeing you on the virus tour.  Yes.  Tickets are on sale right now through Ticketmaster for all the dates, all the infos on opianathlete.com.  I'm out of here.  I'll see you guys.  Have a safe vacation, everybody.  We're going to leave you with the sounds of Anthony driving home.  Anthony, you go as long as you want, okay? 
[04:02:00]  All right.  All right.  Anthony driving his car.  We'll see you guys in a little while.  Great vacation, everybody.  That's a vacation.  To the studio audience, thank you.  Thanks for the support.  We greatly appreciate it.  Drew Boogie, thank you.  We'll just keep Anthony on in his car and run a Fezzer up at noon.  Thanks, guys.  Oh.  That's good.  I'm getting out of the way.  Look at this idiot.  All right.  Little Peter Gabriel. 
[04:02:30]  Oh.  Just about to 2nd Avenue.  My favorite part is getting on the Queensborough Bridge.  Because no one understands you can't go straight here.  If I get pulled over, it'll be really interesting.  Having to explain to the police officer why I'm using a cell phone. 
[04:03:00]  All right.  I'm bored with that song.  There's some awful music on XM.  Oh, am I on the air?  Fuck.  What is that?  Oh, how about the Boneyard?  Oh. 
[04:03:30]  Metallica.  One.  Ding dong.  Pretty boring drive.  Sorry.  Not many, uh...  Not many assholes on the road.  Ding dong.  Uh, what?  What?  Hello?  Hello?  Is anyone in here?  Hello?  Hello.  Hi.  What's your name?  My name's John.  What's your name? 
[04:04:00]  Uh, I'm, uh, I'm Tony.  How you doing?  I'm doing good.  How are you?  Uh, good.  So, uh...  Anyone else in the room?  Hello?  Hello?  Hello?  Yeah, um...  Where are you from?  Uh, New York City?  Yeah?  What do you like?  Uh, you know, the usual.  I don't...  What's the usual?  Well, how... 
[04:04:30]  How big's your cock?  Faggot!  Sorry, I thought I was calling the gay hotline.  I got mixed up.  I didn't realize I was...  No, you ass.  I wanted to talk about hockey.  You told me.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  Come on.  There we go. 
[04:05:00]  People don't...  Oh, shit.  My tongue is just squealing.  I keep forgetting I'm in a big vehicle.  I try to drive this like a race car.  Where are you going on vacation?  Uh, I can't say.  You can't say?  No, it's top secret.  Is it somewhere warm?  Actually, I'll be in Miami, too.  Will you?  Oh, you want to...  Now, I want to hook up.  This is terrible. 
[04:05:30]  How come every other day,  it's like a harrowing drive home,  and I'm making every light.  There's no one in my way.  This can only mean the second I hang up.  Well, that's why...  Pandemonium.  That's why I thought this would be a good idea,  because of the old days when we used to drive in together.  Yeah.  I'm not going to, you know, fake it.  I would...  Well, okay.  That was a little annoying.  What was that?  Somebody just jammed on the brakes in front of me.  For no fucking reason.  I love that one.  And now I'm entering this area in Queens 
[04:06:00]  where people don't understand  that these lights stay green on this side  for like two seconds,  and you've got to really move quickly.  But now there's a cop vehicle in front of me,  so I can't really beep at them.  I'll just beep.  What's the protocol with the cop trucks  that haul around, like, the roadblocks and shit?  There's no one in there that can, like, get you in trouble.  Nah, those...  They're just driving a fucking truck.  I think those guys are the plebes, man.  They're fine.  Beep.  Beep at them.  They're not real...  They're not real cops. 
[04:06:30]  They just look.  Yeah, they don't have any radios or anything.  I don't see an antenna, so fuck them.  Please drive on the sidewalk in front of everybody.  Oh, shit.  I don't think I could get up through there.  No.  No, not through that.  Well, if the road was blocked...  Because this is also the area where a big rig's back into these warehouses  and block the road for, like, fucking ten minutes.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  And then that's when I make my sidewalk moves. 
[04:07:00]  But if this guy decides he's going to do it, I could do it.  But the cop vehicle, that would be really funny.  It would just look at me like I'm a real asshole.  All right.  There he goes.  Okay.  Yeah, so, okay, we're done.  I got nothing going on here.  It's the easy drive home.  What do you mean?  There's, like, no traffic, really.  There's no assholes in my way.  And then what happened?  And then...  Come on, where are you going on vacation? 
[04:07:30]  What?  I'm going to be on vacation with your mom.  You're going to be banging your mom.  See, Anthony can't hear me right now.  What do you like about our show?  I like the fact that I do all the heavy lifting and do all the hard work for the show and take  all the meetings and pick up all the bits for the entire show.  What I like about the show, I like the chemistry between you and I.  I think it's beyond amazing since day one. 
[04:08:00]  We're out of here.  Have, uh...  I was going to say have a good vacation.  I guess we're on vacation.  So, uh, guys, you guys have a good vacation, too.  We'll see you guys soon.  Bye.  There's a virus spreading in our area.  Will it affect you?  Find out on the next Opie and Anthony show.  The virus made my genitals rot off.  I don't really have the virus yet.  I'm kind of itchy and stuff, but I don't really have the virus.  It's that virus you're always talking about.  El virus, the Opie, and Anthony. </pre>
