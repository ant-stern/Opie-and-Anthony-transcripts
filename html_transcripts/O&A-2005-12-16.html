<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony XM Satellite Radio show opened with a chaotic scene outside the studio, described as a "zoo," with a large gathering of their fans, the "pests," protesting outside Howard Stern's studio.  They were engaging in various art projects, including building a coffin for Stern's career. The hosts then extensively discussed the potential New York City transit strike, highlighting the union's internal conflicts, playing audio of their arguments.  Numerous listener calls provided updates on the "pests'" activities outside their own studio.  The show included a review of "King Kong," focusing on its length and CGI, with a caller highlighting the T-Rex battle. A comedic bit featuring "Andrew Dice Gay" was played, and there was discussion about listener bans and ways to circumvent them.  Patrice O'Neal, Club Soda Kenny, and various listeners contributed throughout this portion. The show concluded this segment with an account of a hit and run incident involving Opie's car service.

The next segment focused on the "pests'" attempts to access the studio and featured sexually explicit content.  The hosts recounted a fabricated story about masturbating in the White House, followed by a caller's less scandalous confession.  The bulk of this segment detailed the "pests'" efforts to reach the studio, the security response, and their counter-strategies. Vulgar and sexually explicit language was frequently used to describe the events and the perceived actions of Howard Stern and Sirius. Numerous callers provided updates, with one advocating for Patrice O'Neal as a replacement host. Another described police escorting the "pests" away.  The studio guests included Patrice O'Neal, Twitchells (who tried Red Bull for the first time and discussed his Tourette's), and Gavin.  The hosts also discussed Jimmy (another host’s absence and apparent celebrity connections), Howard Stern, and other figures.  A significant portion involved playing and discussing clips of "loud orgasms" from pornography, with graphic descriptions and commentary. They announced a "homeless shopping spree" for Tuesday, involving Bill Burr and Rich Voss. The segment concluded with further discussion about the rally.

The following segment was a chaotic mix of in-studio guests and remote updates. Gavin excitedly talked about Big A, a popular English comedian. Twitchells, highly caffeinated, was a central figure. Cowhead, recently fired from his radio show, recounted his final day.  Paul, a remote correspondent, reported on over 100 listeners causing a scene near the Empire State Building, using crude sexual chants.  The show interviewed Randall, the winner of *The Apprentice*, with Opie and Anthony making racially charged jokes.  A significant portion involved a betting game based on Twitchells' Tourette's, with escalating bets and varying definitions of a “breach” of silence.  The segment concluded with updates on the listeners disrupting Howard Stern’s rally and promotion of MTV's New Year's Eve programming featuring Damien Fahey, who was in studio.

The next excerpt began with a discussion about a disliked beverage ("liquid sweetheart") and featured Damien Fahey from MTV promoting a New Year's Eve special. A large portion focused on a New Jersey bear hunt, including audio clips.  The show included bathroom humor regarding Patrice and Twitchell. Ron from the Ron and Fez show recounted encountering Stern's protest, comparing its size to past protests.  They discussed outdated Opie and Anthony posters at the protest.  The conversation shifted to *The Apprentice*, comparing a contestant to Humpty Hump. A listener called about a past incident that nearly got Opie and Anthony fired, leading to discussion about their current actions and potential consequences.  They discussed an intern's departure and Earl's workplace meltdown. A significant portion involved a "news" segment with Big A and Twitchells, where Big A struggled to read the news copy due to its use of "S-T words," leading to repeated restarts. Listener calls reacted to this humor. A conflict between Kenny and Frenchie about a Halloween party escalated into insults and threats.  Patrice O'Neal's shows were promoted, and a tech support call prank featuring Matt Besser was played.

The final segment recounted the aftermath of a large-scale event, possibly a protest or march ("Million P.E.S.T. March"), involving the "P.E.S.T." group.  Patrice O'Neal was in studio with Opie and Anthony.  Callers discussed difficulties entering the Hard Rock Cafe, participant exhaustion, and minor violence.  Video and photos were promised for opandanthony.com. Several callers promoted their own work (Mafialife.com, Tourette'sBets.com, laughterbylew.com, comedycabaret.com). One caller jokingly offered Patrice O'Neal KKK membership. Another caller's comments about black listeners and the use of racial slurs by both the caller and the hosts led to further discussion using extremely offensive language.  Pre-recorded Howard Stern chants at the event were discussed. The hosts thanked the P.E.S.T. participants and ended with final plugs and thank yous.

[00:05:00]  But enough of this palaver!  Let's get the show on the road!  I'm scared of you!  I'm scared!  Asshole!  Asshole!  Asshole!  Asshole!  Asshole!  Asshole!  Asshole!  Asshole!  ONA Body Rock!  ONA Body Rock!  ONA Body Rock!  Hello exactly!  It stinks and I don't like it! 
[00:05:30]  I have absolutely no idea what's going on  Good morning and welcome to the OPA and Anthony program on XM Satellite Radio  Hi!  A little excited this morning, sorry about that little stammer  There will be many today  Oh!  Like every day for me  It's the ONA virus spreading across America  Thanks for checking us out  Thank you  It's an absolute zoo outside the studio right now. 
[00:06:00]  Yes.  It's a zoo.  There's all kinds of things going on.  I was actually walking into the studio like I do every morning.  And you know what I enjoy walking into the studio?  Nothing.  I enjoy when nothing happens.  When I grab my papers from the office, grab my water, and I walk to the studio.  And I don't like being touched, bothered, spoken to, or anything. 
[00:06:30]  I'm handed intel.  There's intel going through it.  I'm handed a piece of paper with, like, intel on it.  And then I go to give it back to the guy and he goes, no, hand it to him.  Like I'm the guy, here you go, like in a war room.  Like, leave me a lunch.  My little walk.  There's a typewriter going off in a teletype.  I call them typewriters.  Let's go back.  Let's go old school.  There's a big table and they're pushing around, like, plastic models of tanks on it. 
[00:07:00]  And I don't know why, but it's of Europe.  I don't know what that means.  There's old phones ringing.  There's a room just dedicated to stocks.  They're just yelling, sell, sell, sell, sell, sell, sell.  What's going on?  We have no idea, man.  Sell, buy, buy, sell, sell.  It's just, we have an area outside the studio right now just dedicated to art projects. 
[00:07:30]  Yeah.  It's like, enough with the art projects.  Get the hell out there.  Get the hell out there, soldiers.  Just go.  Sir.  They're stapling and gluing.  I think I saw glitter out there, Anthony.  I got a bad feeling about this one, El Tay.  What do you say there, El Tay?  It's unbelievable.  There are thousands of people around this area right now.  Yeah.  You know, they're heading off to Howie's last broadcast and commercial radio. 
[00:08:00]  Yep.  Our fans have already assaulted Howard's show.  Yeah, we're getting some reports in on instant feedback from people monitoring.  Yeah.  And apparently they threw it down onto the street to get some reactions, and they certainly did.  Yeah, they got a nice reaction.  A big earful of O&A and then a pistol of Howard going,  or just bring them up to here.  Just bring them up here.  Just bring them back into the studio.  Ah, motherfucker.  Ah.  That's why they're called pests.  That's right.  The pests are already doing their jobs. 
[00:08:30]  But it's just hilarious, man.  They're handing out signs.  Oh, I know.  There was like a group of people outside our station,  and they're just being handed signs and just being pushed into the battle.  Yeah.  Just push them in.  Grab a gun and go, soldier.  Instead of handing out the guns,  they're just handing out these big cartoon Opie and Anthony signs.  Big signs.  Go, go, go, go, go, go.  Go, deploy.  Deploy.  A band of retards. 
[00:09:00]  A band of retards.  But we love you guys.  Ah, shit.  Instead of band of brothers, it's the band of retards.  The ministry of morons are meeting as we speak to try to figure this out.  Oh, God.  There's so much energy in the air this morning.  I love it.  Absolutely love it.  Hmm.  Ah.  Been drinking all night on the way to the rally.  That's what we need.  There you go. 
[00:09:30]  That's it.  That's what we get.  And the weather here in New York,  not very conducive to people being outside.  Well, the rain is stopping.  The rain is going to stop.  Well, they said...  Within the next hour, hour and a half.  Really?  I heard...  Now it's all day?  Early this afternoon, the rain will be stopping.  Oh, wow.  But all morning, you're going to be getting some rain.  All right.  I got a weather report.  They said it was going to stop by 9.  Ah, whatever.  Whatever.  I had to...  I'm exhausted.  Say, listen.  Keep that door open. 
[00:10:00]  Listen.  Oh, let's listen.  Listen in to the ministry of morons.  Well, they're being quiet now.  Oh, because now they want to listen to the show?  The ministry of morons.  That's hysterical.  I had to stay up until, like, after midnight  because of the stupid transit strike threat.  Because, let's say...  And I knew they weren't going to strike,  but there's a chance that they were going to at midnight 
[00:10:30]  when the deadline came around.  So, I couldn't go to sleep before that  because I have to set the alarm.  If they had a strike,  I got to be in the city before 5 a.m.  Because what they're doing, if there is a strike,  you will need four people in your vehicle  in order to enter the city.  Four people in your vehicle.  You don't know four people.  I don't know four people.  He doesn't know four people.  They absolutely don't.  Oh, yeah?  Yeah.  Help me out?  Absolutely. 
[00:11:00]  Yeah, Keith would help you out.  Maybe I'd get a little help there.  But if you had to do it, like everyone else,  you would be fucked.  So, I'm up at midnight.  I'm waiting, and I hear, you know,  well, they're still talking.  So, I reached the point.  I was like, I got to go to sleep.  These sons of bitches with the transit union,  I don't care who's listening to the transit union people.  You know, we haven't gotten a raise in this, that.  I don't care.  I don't care.  Deal with it between you and your boss.  When you have a problem with your boss, 
[00:11:30]  it's not supposed to affect everybody in a major fucking city.  You're not holding your boss hostage here.  You're holding people that are trying to get the fucking work hostage,  and it's not garnering much sympathy from the people out there  when you're sitting around not knowing what you're going to have to do  to get into work the next day.  So, I stayed up, waited, and then just said,  fuck it, set the alarm for the normal time, and drive in.  And Club Soda Kenny brings up a great point.  I know.  Shocking. 
[00:12:00]  But he actually did.  He must have drank his carrot juice last night.  He said, watch what they do,  and wait until everyone is in town,  and then decide to strike.  Then you're going to get people that are literally stranded here in the city.  Kenny, how are you this morning?  Good morning.  Yeah, that's the way I see it.  That would be the ultimate scumbag fucking move that these guys could pull.  Because if they striked at midnight, everybody would have just stayed home today.  Stay home, get the four-person car pulled together if they had to come in. 
[00:12:30]  Yeah, but now everybody's in, so now they're like held hostage.  And then how do you get out?  Exactly.  And then when the city sees the pandemonium from this,  they're going to have to make concessions to the transit authority.  And it's holding the working man hostage.  That's what they're doing.  That's the way I see it.  And they can't even get along amongst themselves.  I saw a clip last night where they had the vice president of the transit authority union.  He's on there.  They wouldn't let him into the big table meetings, they called it. 
[00:13:00]  It sounded like someone arguing that,  why do I have to sit at the kid's table at Christmas dinner?  Why am I at the kiddie table when he is at the big person's table?  It was the conversation.  This guy, and he came, I think he was Italian,  because he was really pissed.  And he had the, you know, the fucking fuck without the fucks.  But, you know, he was so pissed off.  I am the vice president.  I should be there at these meetings.  I should be there.  I'm being shut out. 
[00:13:30]  No secret meetings.  No secret meetings.  They try to bodily remove him from the podium.  Then the president of the transit union comes up.  Here he is on TV now.  Roger Toussaint.  Is that his name?  Something like that.  Yeah.  He comes out.  And I don't know where he's from.  Some island somewhere.  Because he's just like,  that is the reason why we need medical coverage. 
[00:14:00]  Because so people can get on their medication.  His vice president, he's saying, is a kook who needs medication.  These are the people that are trying to broker the deal.  I think it's the Patrice voice.  The dibble dibble.  Dibble dabble union.  Dibble dabble benefits.  He's the president of the transit union.  What is his, um...  I don't know.  He's got a little dibble dabble.  I don't know if he's...  It's like West Indian.  It's West Indian or something. 
[00:14:30]  It's like Case of the Dibble.  West Indian.  And some of the things they're coming up with,  if you want to pot him up, you can hear him speak right now.  All right.  He told New Yorkers that he was not even going to try to get a deal done.  Uh-oh.  Trinidad is an insult.  This is an insult to transit workers.  And an insult to every person in this city who depends on our bus and subway system.  This sounds good.  Look at the dude on his left.  Yeah.  Chairman Calico finally made his first appearance at the negotiating table. 
[00:15:00]  Negotiate.  We give him the rock coat.  He decided to come into the table an hour before the contract deadline for nearly 34,000 workers was plenty of time.  Yeah.  One hour for 34,000 workers.  That was the MTA's idea of good faith bargaining.  Uh-oh.  And we tried to bargain with the MTA.  This don't sound good.  We negotiated well past our contractual deadline.  I think you might be right, Kenny.  Because we wanted to get a deal done, and we still do. 
[00:15:30]  Uh-huh.  However, the MTA is insisting on a contract that would leave the next generation of transit workers behind.  How am I going to get home?  It's all good.  A contract that would put a lock-on-key on every transit workers' access to the middle class.  I just want to hear this accent asking me if I want another banana daiquiri.  The MTA has, through its actions and inactions.  You want another daiquiri, man.  I'm not negotiating.  Coconut drink. 
[00:16:00]  Coconut drink.  Are you ready?  Are you ready, man, for the coconut drink?  That's what I want.  Braids.  Braids.  So the private bus lines.  Your man, Jet Ski Rides.  Jet Ski Rides.  For members who operate these lines, which are soon to be part of the MTA bus.  All right.  Well, we'll get to you.  We'll see what happens.  We'll get the headline.  Although, um, the, uh, the red, the red graphic now over Channel 7 says transit strike. 
[00:16:30]  What?  A strike call that says on the bottom.  Now, that was green before that said they're running.  Holy shit.  These motherfuckers.  Wait a minute.  Oh, Fox is late.  Fox is a transit running.  Transit strike.  Transit running.  I'm looking at ABC.  We got two TVs in the studio.  Transit strike.  Strike called.  And, uh, Channel 5 says transit running.  This is the problem with the news these days.  There's just, what do you do?  Well, it looks like.  What's going on?  ABC is a little more prepared.  They had.  It was like the, uh. 
[00:17:00]  It's a guest thing going on right now.  Yeah.  It was like the losing team in the championship game.  They had their hats.  They had two, they had two, uh.  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah, you got to have both of them printed up.  Well, all right.  He's walking away.  So now they'll probably say.  Yeah, let's see what we're in.  Is it Jamaica?  Triborough?  Korea?  Jamaica?  All right, so we just heard from Roger Toussaint, the union leader, who when he took the podium  and began by criticizing the tactics of the MTA, Gridlock Sands started shaking his head  because we could tell this was not a settlement.  They were about to announce.  Did I hear him right? 
[00:17:30]  That they're saying they're going to start a strike with some private bus lines?  Yeah.  Well, what's happened is the MTA recently took over about seven bus lines from the city of  New York.  They're slowly going to start striking.  Slow, like.  Are they going to ooze into it and try to use that as a little intimidation?  Yeah, ooze in.  We're going to start the private bus lines.  And if you don't, you know, get this taken care of, then we'll go to this, then that.  Who takes the private buses?  Ah, the retards.  Yeah, is that what it is?  I don't know.  I don't know.  Hockey helmet people?  Probably our listeners.  I'm just kidding. 
[00:18:00]  I'm really beating up our listeners today.  This is a disaster.  Someone is suggesting that they're not the band of retards, our listeners, that are outside  the studio right now.  What are they?  They are the band of bothers.  Band of bothers.  That's a good one.  That's good.  That's good.  Got to give Steve and Basher the credit for that one.  Steven S.  All right, and another big story as far as this show goes.  Let's go to Houston Killer.  Houston Killer, what's up?  Hey, I just wanted to say that I was driving home last night, and I caught that replay of 
[00:18:30]  Patrice talking about that chick, excuse me, of Rave, and going to jail, and man, it wasn't  funny, but it was the best 20 fucking minutes of radio I've ever heard, guys.  It was fucking awesome.  Punch it out.  All right, thanks.  It was just amazing radio.  We didn't know that was going to happen yesterday, and Patrice just showed us a piece of his soul.  Yeah, right?  I was sitting there giggling about somebody else's problems and shit for a second.  And then something just clicked inside, and next thing you know, we're looking at Patrice's  soul.  Yeah. 
[00:19:00]  The awful one it is.  That's some rough shit.  Unbelievable.  They're now trying to make a coffin.  Do we have an art director?  They're attempting to build a coffin right now.  Get Paul in here.  Get a potato chip bag.  Is there a set designer?  Holy shit.  I don't know.  Maybe someone should tell these guys that the thing is already happening.  It's going to be over by the time they're done.  They're going to have all their props.  What are you trying to make out there?  You liney fuck.  What are you doing?  You want me to tell you?  Yes.  They're making a coffin for Stern's career. 
[00:19:30]  All right.  Not my idea before your car crashed the fuck out of me.  Yeah, but don't you understand, like, the thing is happening now?  And you don't have a lid even made for it?  Not my idea.  That's Bam's planet, unfortunately.  Yeah, but you guys don't.  Do you have an art director?  Yeah, there you go.  There you go.  Yeah, it's Keith with the Jägermeister coffin case.  Yeah, just trace that.  Oh, my God.  They're attempting to do our project.  Oh, my God.  Not my idea.  It's a kindergarten fucking field trip. 
[00:20:00]  We got our crayons.  It's a little field trip.  He's already dribbled coffee all over his nice sweater.  What is wrong with this?  I don't know what this has to do with helping out this and being a pest as far as the Stern thing goes,  but I saw one guy out there gluing macaroni to a plate, and he's spray-painting it gold.  And I don't know why.  With glitter.  Just so everybody knows, it's Chester's Ashes that's doing this, so you can rip the shit out of the black bag later. 
[00:20:30]  Chester's Ashes.  Chester's Ashes is in charge of the coffin project.  All right, we'll see how that goes.  Project Coffin is underway, Opie.  Project Coffin.  Project Coffin.  Can we bring him in?  So you can rip the shit out of him?  No, we just rip the shit out of you.  Okay, that's fine.  I would bail on the coffin.  I don't think you guys...  Okay, hold on.  Just bail on it.  I don't think they could do it.  Bail on the coffin.  We're not doing this.  Bail on the coffin.  It's another mission being pulled off by the dopey dozen. 
[00:21:00]  Bail on the coffin.  Wow, your wife is giving her the finger.  She wants the coffin built.  All right, make the coffin, whatever.  I think she wants to put your body in there.  That's right.  Exactly.  Not quite.  All right, thank you, Paul.  Thank you, Kelly.  Thanks for all you do, whatever that is.  There he goes.  All right.  So, Patricia, you all right today?  Yeah, I was all right.  I'm scared, man.  I'm glad you're all right.  God damn lightning.  You have nothing to worry about, in my humble opinion.  What do you want me to do?  What do you got, Eric?  There's a clip of people interrupting Howard this morning. 
[00:21:30]  Oh, all right.  Oh, really?  These are always fun.  This is the first volley.  All right, listen to this.  Let's find...  Let's check to the naked chick.  All right.  They always get the attention.  Yeah.  Well, you know what?  You should see what the rest of these guys look like.  How you doing, baby?  Hold on.  She sounds like Gary.  What, you're talking to Gary like that?  I'm practicing my pickup line.  I think they said Artie's just getting in.  Hold on.  Here we go.  Let Artie say hi to the crowd. 
[00:22:00]  Is Artie right there?  You know, I don't know.  I just heard a bunch of people yelling, Artie.  No, they weren't.  And right after that, they pulled Gary off the mic and went back into the studio.  There was people in the back yelling, O and A, O and A, Howard sucks.  That's all we got.  Jeez, that was the first volley.  I think you should isolate that because it sounded like, Artie, we love you.  You might have to...  I want to go along with this fianco.  Oh, shit.  But I think you should get some fucking equipment. 
[00:22:30]  Isolate the O and A, motherfucker.  We need some doctorate.  CSI sound fucking shit.  Do you hear it?  Wait, we're going to slow down.  Sound wave on the friggin' monitor.  See how his mouth is moving?  It's an O.  That's not an A, motherfucker.  It's an O and A.  We need Steven Spielberg in this joint immediately.  Peter Jackson.  He's done with Kong.  He can make this look better for us. 
[00:23:00]  The O and A interruption.  Peter Jackson uncut.  The director's cut.  What we did was film some of our people in front of a green screen.  And being boisterous and rambunctious, we later added in the crowd and the New York City scene.  It cost ten million, it was a ten million dollar O and A interruption fine.  By the way, I went and saw Kong last night. 
[00:23:30]  You did?  I got in, yeah.  I went to the movie theater on a goof going, let me see if it's sold out.  Showed up at 3.55, got into a four o'clock showing, got out of the theater around 7.30.  Holy crap.  Over three hours, right?  Three hours and 15 minutes, Kevin?  3.15.  They're saying, big long movie.  And it's a good movie.  I'm not going to sit here and try to say it's not a good movie, but I was expecting more.  The action scenes, in my opinion, way too long at times. 
[00:24:00]  Way too fucking long.  Yeah, Peter Jackson likes doing that.  And it was one action scene after another for a while.  I think half the movie was one action scene.  I've seen how some people would say, good.  I like that.  Did you cry?  There were people, absolutely not.  There were people crying.  Absolutely not.  And for the record.  You should have seen his face just scrunch up like, what the fuck I am.  I have no problem admitting that I cry from time to time, but not at a stupid Kong movie. 
[00:24:30]  But you could hear the sniffles.  If you go to Kong this weekend, I mean, if you want a real treat, listen closely to the people.  Mostly you'll hear them behind you, obviously.  You'll hear sniffling all over the theater.  Like, you're crying over this horse shit?  This love story that is not believable on any fucking level?  Not even in a fantasy world?  Right?  Yeah.  The love story they were attempting to make?  Please.  He couldn't even reach his finger in between her legs to, like, even rub her clit. 
[00:25:00]  Like, just...  No.  There's no space to do anything.  Any type of sexual contact would be sure death for her.  Like, anything.  A little stroke down the face.  Rip a face off.  Some of the scenes, because they got some great creatures and monsters in this thing.  I'll tell you this much.  When they go to Skull Island, that is just amazing.  Yeah.  Props to that whole thing.  But then there was other scenes where...  Didn't the head of the Transit Workers Union show up on Skull Island? 
[00:25:30]  Oh, shit.  Dibble-double.  King Kong.  Dibble-double.  Someone is saying when Kong fights the T-Rexes, it's worth the admission.  Yeah, I hear that.  That's pretty good.  Let's go to Rich in New Hampshire.  Rich.  Hey, what's up, guys?  It's a first-time caller up here in New Hampshire.  I just want to let you guys know you guys rock.  Thanks, Rich.  Just calling to let Patrice know.  I know he said he didn't want to see the movie, but you definitely got to go see it, Patrice.  The scene where Kong battles the T-Rexes is basically the best action scene I've seen 
[00:26:00]  in a movie in a long time.  You don't think it went on too long?  No, I think it was awesome.  Just the way it was battled, the CGI was incredible.  I think that scene was definitely worth the admission price alone.  There was one scene, though, it looked like Jack Black and whoever the other guy was,  they were just running.  It was so obvious they were running in front of a screen.  I'm like, it's now 2005.  Yeah, yeah, I know.  You know what scene I'm talking about? 
[00:26:30]  It was so obvious they were running in front of a screen.  I'm like, Peter Jackson handed this in?  The dinosaurs were running, you're talking about, right?  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah.  That was a little obvious.  I mean, there's a couple spots where you could definitely tell it was CGI,  but after watching the movie, you can't really, you know.  But there are times it was amazing when Kong was holding her and stuff.  That was so believable, you know.  It didn't look like a huge mechanical arm that's all stiff,  like in the old movie.  Yeah.  You don't even realize you're looking at a computer image of Kong, 
[00:27:00]  you know, after 15, 20 minutes of seeing him.  All right.  Thanks, Rich.  Watch out, guys.  You guys rule.  All right.  John from Philly.  Let's say hi to John.  John, what's up?  Hey, guys.  What's going on?  Hey, man.  Listen, that clip from Stern this morning, I was listening to it,  and they were yelling already.  There was ONA in the background.  Yeah.  But already big come up.  I mean, if we're going to do this, guys, we've got to do it all right.  I don't want to look like Stern, you know what I mean?  How are you guys looking like him?  Well, yeah, we're not going to sit here and say,  you can hear him. 
[00:27:30]  Oh, stop.  Dude, that was honestly.  I'm really trying to go along with that.  Like, you're just sitting there like, oh, shit, yeah, y'all.  I kept waiting to hear it.  That was the first we were hearing it as you were hearing it on the air, sir.  I think that was that nigga that stubbed his toe.  Yeah.  Oh, hey.  Hey, y'all.  Yeah.  He got his toe stepped on, and he went, oh, hey.  You hear it?  Oh, and hey.  We all looked around at each other, getting the douche chills at the exact same time.  Like, I don't want to hear shit. 
[00:28:00]  Yeah, I didn't hear anything.  How are we going to make something out of that?  You're not.  Nothing going on there.  Oh, man.  But the coffin will be made by.  At least I was honest enough to fucking, like, not go in.  By noon, 1 o'clock p.m., though, that coffin will be made.  That'll show them.  They're still making the coffin.  And now Denise is yelling at Paul, because he's not making the coffin right.  Get Denise in here.  What the fuck?  Oh, Jesus.  Real quick.  What is the ministry of morons? 
[00:28:30]  They're falling apart in front of our eyes.  That part in Kong, right, when he's crawling around on the ground, like he was crawling from  something.  What was that scene?  It's in the trailers.  It looked like bombs are dropping.  Which one is that?  All right, never mind.  They used the gas bombs on them?  I was just trying to...  Oh, near the...  Oh, okay.  No, no gas bombs?  No.  Well, then I won't have people give that away.  Denise, it looks like you're very frustrated outside the studio.  What's going on?  Yeah, because you guys are now saying don't do the coffin.  Do you think the coffin's very important to this?  Well, it was Bam's idea, and, you know, he's the general. 
[00:29:00]  Ah.  See, they have to follow Bam's orders.  Did you hear that sarcasm?  Oh, this ain't good, man.  Well, look, she's got her hands on her hips, like it's...  I like, in true O&A fashion, like with anyone involved in this show, she managed to pass  the buck in the first ten seconds of conversation.  Bam's idea.  So if it's complete fucking meltdown, one me.  Are you going to...  But why didn't you guys make it ahead of time?  That's what I said, but, you know...  We had weeks to plan for this, and we're trying to make a believable coffin. 
[00:29:30]  You need a woman to do the job.  All right.  Let me tell you something.  Listen, one of your guys' sorry asses are going to end up in that coffin, beaten to  a pulp, is what's going to happen out there.  I'd be happy if it's Paul.  Yeah, we can only hope it's Paul.  I can only hope if it's him.  Paul, what's up?  He thinks it's lame.  He thinks the...  All right.  Yeah, he thinks it's lame.  All right, that's Denise, and no filter Paul, what's up?  Hey, how you doing?  I want to bring Chester in, because we told him, like, ten minutes ago, you guys thought 
[00:30:00]  this was a joke, and he doesn't fucking stop, so...  Chester, why don't you explain to these guys what you're doing?  This is Bam's idea.  Bam decided, wanted to put together a coffin, so we're making him a coffin.  You guys don't want it?  We'll stop making it.  No, I mean...  We can follow in order.  Yeah, we're following orders.  He's completely out of breath by making coffins today.  Yeah.  He's like, hey, no, I'm completely out of breath, because he's kicking the fuck off.  That would be really funny if you dropped out of a hardtack making a coffin.  Oh, look at this.  No, you guys don't want me to make it.  They're arguing with each other, dude.  No, we're arguing with him. 
[00:30:30]  Yeah.  Because you guys told me on air ten minutes ago to get this stopped and move on.  Dissension in the ranks already.  Yeah, exactly.  They're not even out on the street yet.  Chester won't do it, because General Bam hasn't instructed him to stop doing it yet.  That's what we're up to right now.  All right, well, why don't you just build the coffin?  I don't want to disappoint, Bam.  Yeah, but they're having so much fun out there.  Chester's back building the coffin.  Denise is going to help.  Thank goodness.  And there goes no filter, Paul.  Holy shit.  He only came in and had a stroke.  Hey, if you guys don't want me to build it, I'll be, you know.  Can you imagine he drops dead as he's building a coffin? 
[00:31:00]  They're so excited.  Even if he was dead, you'd still have to laugh.  He would still have to laugh.  He's banging actual nails in the fucking cardboard.  Yeah, nails in the coffin.  My God, man.  Styrofoam cup, giant styrofoam, what do they call it, the industrial giant box of the BJ's  wholesaler styrofoam box that they're going to try to quickly spray paint black and put  two pieces of curly hair sticking out like it's Howard's hair and shit and the whole fucking 
[00:31:30]  Oh, my God.  Unbelievable.  Why don't we take our first break?  We got the tippy-tom singing thing we want to play here.  I love this.  And we'll continue with the Opie and Anthony program.  From Stinko Records, it's the new collection of covers from America's favorite derelict.  I'm the original golden boy.  Tippy Tom, regurgitated.  Tom Jones.  It's not unusual to be in love. 
[00:32:00]  He's drunk, smells like beef.  It's not unusual.  And he's forgotten most of the lyrics.  That, who, who, e, e, e, e, e, e, e, e, e, e, e, e, e, e, e, e, e, e, e, e, e, e, e, e, e, e, e, e, e, e, e, e, e, e, e, e, e, e, e, e, e, e, e, e, e, e.  Tippy Tom, regurgitated, chews up your favorite pop hits.  She's a lady.  Whoa, whoa, whoa, she's a lady.  And spews them back out, dirtier, grittier, and stinkier than farts and old beer.  But the lady is mine.  Or something like that.  From your favorite haunting melodies. 
[00:32:30]  Riders on the storm.  Something like that.  To your most cherished classic rock cut.  Come on, baby, light my fire.  Tippy Tom hunkers down, craps all over him, and refuses to wipe.  Time's sick tonight on fire!  And if you act now, you'll receive Tippy Tom's tribute to the town he calls home.  I've been stuck on Frank Sinatra.  Start spreading the news.  It's old blue eyes. 
[00:33:00]  I'm leaving today.  Meets old crusty eyes.  I'm gonna be a part of it.  New York, New York.  It's a sappy salute to the city that broke his spirit, crushed his dreams,  and left him blowing strange men for cheap wine in the Port Authority bus terminal.  If I can make it here, I can make it.  Tippy Tom. 
[00:33:30]  Anywhere.  Regurgitated.  It's up to you, New York.  New York.  That's my verse.  Wrapped in a special carrying case, brown in the back, yellow in the front, just like Tom's underwear.  Call 1-800-NO-T-CELL right now for your copy of Tippy Tom.  Regurgitated.  Any more requests?  This is Anthony Harris.  Get infected.  Jim's got a comment.  Jim in New York.  Yeah, this is how Andrew Dice Gay would sound like. 
[00:34:00]  Andrew Dice Gay.  Hey, huh?  So I'm hanging out with these fags.  Hickory dickory dock.  Hey, hey, write your own joke.  Oh!  Dice was good.  There was an old woman who lived in a shoe.  I hate chicks, so I found the guy to swallow my goo.  Oh!  There was an old man that lived in a boot. 
[00:34:30]  I fucked him so hard.  He had to poot.  Oh!  Andrew Dice Gay.  I'm the Dice Man lover.  See my sparkled bedazzled jacket?  My leather?  Used to say dice.  Now look.  Faggot.  I just wrote in Rubies and Rhinestones.  Big faggot. 
[00:35:00]  That's what I do now.  I'm over here now.  I used to be over there.  Now I'm over here by the man ass.  You ever just shove your nose in a man's asshole  and take a whiff?  Isn't it beautiful?  It's beautiful.  And then he goes,  So this guy walks up to me and goes,  Dice, will you suck my cock?  I said, sure, I'm a faggot. 
[00:35:30]  Oh!  You hear me?  I blow you.  You hear?  Oh, shit.  All day long.  Suck my cock, Dice.  All right, already.  Pull it out.  I don't want to sleep in the wet spot.  The whole bed's a wet spot.  I've been fucking you for hours.  Oh!  Andrew Dice game. 
[00:36:00]  Instead of Dice, it's daggett.  Instead of Dice.  Jack and Jill went up the hill.  Jill came down.  I went up and blew Jack.  It don't rhyme.  It just happened that way.  Two faggots walk into a bar.  It's me and a friend.  It's not even a joke here.  Andrew Dice gay.  Oh! 
[00:36:30]  Oh, my God.  Jack, be nimble.  Jack, be quick.  Whip it out.  I'll suck that dick.  Oh!  So I'm online at the bank.  And I got my tongue up this guy's ass.  And he's like, why do you got your tongue up my ass?  I said, because I'm a faggot.  Oh!  Goose right in my face. 
[00:37:00]  Goose.  Goose.  All right. 
[00:37:30]  Here, check it out.  The Opie and Anthony program on XM Satellite Radio.  Man, it's a scene, I gotta tell ya.  I don't know what kind of scene, but...  We're gonna get some reports from the street in a minute or two.  The pests are gathering like crazy.  Well, some of the people that I guess didn't make it down are commenting,  no offense guys, and please don't ban me,  but these guys make being a pest seem gay. 
[00:38:00]  I mean, really, what the fuck is it with this,  oh, the general told me this and that,  just get out there and annoy the shit out of hoo-hoo.  Be a pest.  Oh, God bless that guy, too.  Anthony, you're such a notorious asshole.  They gotta preface everything with...  Do me a favor.  Don't ban me.  Don't ban me.  Now they're...  Sir?  He starts by being a pussy and then comments all the...  Don't ban.  Please?  I wanna stay.  The fear of the ban is in their head,  and it's made it to the message board. 
[00:38:30]  It's fucking notorious.  Oh, yeah.  It's made it to the message board.  Just so he can be evil later.  Listen, this evil ain't worth getting banned for,  but I have to say it.  But I'm really gonna fuck it up later.  I was reading on the message boards about the banning,  and people are saying,  you know, Anthony bans people.  It's so easy to get around it.  All you gotta do is get another IP,  which is this and that.  You can do that.  Do whatever.  You can go around it,  but then you say the same shit,  and he bans you again.  I can ban an IP a lot quicker than you can get one. 
[00:39:00]  And the truth of the matter is,  some people that have been bitching  that they've been banned,  because as you know,  if I ban somebody,  they can still fill out the instant feedback  and send it in,  and they will never get a message  that they've been banned or anything.  They'll say,  thank you for your comments.  We just never see them here.  So some of the people that I said I banned,  I didn't ban.  So your messages are still getting through.  Others,  I never told you that you were banned.  So you just sit there,  typing away,  and you never know the better. 
[00:39:30]  Keep everything a mystery with the bannings.  Gotta tell you.  Did I just see the coffin go by?  I gotta tell you,  it's starting to look like a coffin.  You know what, though?  It's made of fucking cardboard,  and it's pouring out.  So by the time it gets down there,  it's just gonna be this sloppy mess.  I like it.  Chester,  thumbs up to the coffin.  Yeah.  It's gonna be like a New Orleans funeral,  but...  My God.  Coffin's gonna be floating in a puddle somewhere.  Yeah.  Let's go to Danny downstairs, 
[00:40:00]  one of our guys.  Danny, what's up?  Hey, what's going on, guys?  What's the scene outside the studio?  We have a ton of people out here.  I'm gonna have everybody make some noise  just to give you an idea.  All right.  Hey, say hello to the boys, guys.  Holy shit!  Shit, sound like Artie.  What was that?  Come on, step it up.  I didn't hear that.  What?  Could you hear that?  Oh, yeah, we could hear that.  Could you hear?  Yeah, I'm about to head over to Hoo-Hoo 
[00:40:30]  and see what's going on over there,  so I'll keep you guys updated.  All right, yeah, give us some reports, all right?  Oh, we'll make it then, believe me.  Thank you, Danny.  You got it, mister.  All right, there we go, Danny.  That's great.  You know, if they had telephones back in the 1800s,  that would have been the same call  that Custer's men would have phoned in  to their high command.  I'm gonna go take a peek at these engines real quick.  Just to give you an idea.  Yeah, high command. 
[00:41:00]  Yeah, this is, I'm with Custer's group.  We're gonna go over and check out some of those Indians.  Because I heard that, I know, isn't this invention amazing?  It's called the telephone.  And we're just gonna check it out.  We hear there's a few over there,  but we're gonna, like,  we're making some headdresses out of cardboard  so we can goof on them a little bit.  Uh, and, uh, we're gonna go, like,  woo-woo-woo-woo-woo-woo-woo-woo-woo. 
[00:41:30]  And, uh, we'll see what happens.  We'll get back to you.  Yeah, we'll get back to you in a,  in a few hours.  A few hours later, this is all you get.  Hello?  Yeah, uh, Custer's not in right now,  but if you leave a message after the beep,  I'm sure he'll get back to you.  Beep.  I can tell you this much.  I think we're gonna have a problem  because our army is dressed in red  and they're, they're playing,  they're playing instruments.  Yeah, why do they have to dress in red coats  and, uh, they need a drum and a fife player? 
[00:42:00]  Uh, they might, they might see him coming.  Big ONA flag guy carrying that.  What a dummy.  If you said okay to that job back then,  you're just a dummy and deserve to be shot first.  I'm the drummer guy.  I'm gonna just drum across this battlefield  till a big golf ball-sized piece of lead  rips half my head off  and someone else can pick up the drum.  Do those guys at least have a weapon  in their pocket or something?  I'm a drummer. 
[00:42:30]  I'm a drummer.  I'm gonna just carry the flag.  Switching to my tactical drum.  What?  Fucking drum?  Ah, well, someone else made something  for, uh, for this special day.  Reports coming in.  Joe in Hackensack.  Joe?  Yo, what's up, guys?  Hey.  I wanted to, uh, help out with the stern thing,  so I made a, uh, picture frame  and a popsicle stick.  So where should I bring it?  A picture?  Well, that's cute.  Stinky rolls.  Later.  You gotta put, um, something like, uh,  Elmer's Glue and Glitter,  world's best mom. 
[00:43:00]  And then put a picture of your mom in there.  Mike from Kansas.  Mike?  Hey, guys.  Uh, new fan.  Uh, Patrice has been fucking funny.  Does he have a CD or a DVD or anything?  Even a website?  What do you have?  I've got a website, PatriceO'Neal.com.  You do?  Yeah.  PatriceO'Neal.com.  But how do you spell O'Neal?  There's a couple different ways.  The black way.  O-N-E-A-L.  All right.  That's how all black people spell O'Neal.  They don't have one of those things  between the O and the N?  No, apostrophe.  Just all together.  I got, I'll have a shit one of these days, dude. 
[00:43:30]  Just keep kind of peeking.  Thank you.  Look at these guys.  Anthony, please ring your bell once if I'm banned,  twice if I'm not.  And if I'm not important enough to be banned, please.  Thank you, sir.  No, Steve D. from Ron Kongama,  you are still getting through.  Don't you worry.  And I'm not going to be answering everybody  asking if they've been banned.  Defeats the porpoise.  I have an announcement to make.  And I'm banning you for just bringing that up,  by the way, Steve.  I have an announcement to make. 
[00:44:00]  Maybe you can make the announcement  through the window.  All right.  The announcement is, it says in big letters,  please announce, stop smoking pot outside.  The cops are showing up.  All right.  Holy shit.  Maybe you can open one of those windows out there  and bullhorn down, stop smoking pot.  The cops are showing up.  The cops are showing up.  Jesus Christ.  What kind of a fucking army is this that we have?  Let's go to Jeremy in New Jersey.  Jeremy.  What's up, shit dick? 
[00:44:30]  Hey, Jeremy.  Hey, man.  Listen, I was going to bring my handprint  and I played a plaster with my age and date on it,  but I couldn't make it.  You know what?  I saw today that one of the pests brought in.  It's a little late for the Thanksgiving holiday.  He traced his hand and made it look like a turkey.  He put a little beak where his thumb would go  and colored in the furs to look like a wonderful turkey plumage.  And it just says, whoo, whoo, whoo, whoo, whoo.  And it had a gold star on it. 
[00:45:00]  All right.  It was so good.  So that's the latest.  Stop smoking pot outside.  The cops are showing up.  That's wonderful.  Let's go to Adam in Virginia.  You know, they're really good on computers.  That's what I've noticed.  The pests, when it comes to their computers,  you won't find better.  They rule.  They are great.  I guess there are different talents that different people have.  And some are overt and some are covert. 
[00:45:30]  Look at covert.  Let's say hi to Adam in Virginia.  Adam.  Hey, guys.  Hey.  Just wanted to tell you.  You know, Patrice has been doing an awesome job.  And you guys know it.  I'm hoping you make, like, official alternate third seat or something.  You know, like Bill who?  Wow.  Look at that.  You know, I'm not going to lie to you.  We like Bill Burr, too.  And when Jimmy comes back full time, we've got to figure something out with these guys  because they've really, really helped us out a lot.  So we're going to figure something out.  Great job, Patrice.  Thank you.  All right. 
[00:46:00]  I don't want to trash Bill because Bill did good, too.  Wherever he is.  Wherever he is, right.  I don't know.  It would be nice if he showed up once in a while.  If Bill didn't have a career, he'd be.  Is that it?  He's got a career?  I'm officially retired.  I'm just accessible.  I think he's got some kind of sitcom project that he just sold out for.  Yeah.  Bill's going to explode on his feet.  I don't know what the press.  If you got the press release on the Bill Burr project, it's pretty cool, actually.  Imus.  Talking about us again, Anthony.  Oh, yeah.  Actually, lots of XM mentions and Opie and Anthony mentions. 
[00:46:30]  Leno did a nice XM mention.  Oh, yeah?  Because we've got Bob Dylan now doing a show.  Yeah.  Like a music show.  Yeah.  On XM.  I don't know when that starts.  Probably sometime in the first couple weeks of the new year.  Mm-hmm.  But Leno had a joke about it on his show the other night.  Bob Dylan announced he will have a weekly music show on XM Satellite Radio starting in March.  Bob Dylan will be in our show, followed by another hour of the translation of what Bob said.  There you go.  There's the joke.  Of course.  There's the joke that everyone's coming up with. 
[00:47:00]  And then Imus spent some time on the Opie and Anthony show once again.  Yeah, we love the I-man.  We love Imus and what he has done for this program as this continues to grow.  Help us out.  We watch him on MSNBC.  And this is what he had to say.  Actually, I guess it was Rob Bartlett doing one of his characters for Imus.  Yeah.  So we got two clips.  Here's the first one.  Brian Wilson, I see, is here with an eatabullet.com t-shirt on.  What the hell does that mean?  What do you think it means, Opie? 
[00:47:30]  Why don't you heed the advice?  That's Jimmy's website.  Jimmy gave him a shirt at the Caroline's gig, and there you go.  And then Imus went on a nice little thing here about the show and his fagged Hellboy hat.  And as I mentioned, Brian Wilson is here and wearing an eatabullet.com t-shirt.  Where is that from?  Some guy's on Opie and Anthony's show, right?  It's little Jimmy Norton's website, Opie. 
[00:48:00]  And it's his birthday.  It is?  Yes.  Happy birthday to little Jimmy Norton.  Yeah.  Oh, God.  What does he do?  Is he a comedian?  He's a comedian.  He's on HBO and Opie and Anthony's show, which you should know.  I do know.  I'm just kind of playing along here.  Oh.  I get it, Opie.  Rob accused me yesterday of having never listened to Opie and Anthony.  Really?  He said, when did you actually ever listen to Opie and Anthony? 
[00:48:30]  I said, well, one day we're on NAW.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Plus, they're not any different now, are they?  No.  Except they don't have any commercials.  Well, they have some commercials, but not a lot of commercials.  Not like, you know, Howistur.  Right.  He's got 9,000 commercials.  Right.  And then he complains for two minutes about how much radio sucks, and then there's another  9,000 commercials.  It's kind of like you, except instead of complaining about radio sucks, you complain your back hurts. 
[00:49:00]  My back doesn't hurt.  Today.  Yeah.  Except I like Opie and Anthony, because I don't know.  Well, I mean, they're funny.  What am I going to tell you?  And I like Opie.  I feel like I have to apologize for this, although I'm verging on getting into a broke-back mountain  mode here.  It's troubling, yeah.  Well, you know, back in the 70s here in New York, all the queers down in the... 
[00:49:30]  I realize there's a better way to put this, but I don't care.  But all the queers down where I lived in Granny's Village were wearing cowboy hats.  Yeah.  So, I still had to stop wearing them.  So.  You'd have to stop wearing them again.  I understand.  I realize that.  I'm looking at my hair this way.  I mean, look at this.  I mean, my hair is just...  I mean, I can't do anything with it.  It's too long, and it's a mess.  You look like Doris Kearns Goodwin.  I understand that.  So, I've got to do something like...  So, I mean, it's just a whole...  What a mess. 
[00:50:00]  Anyway.  I mean, 26 after the hour.  Quack, quack.  Quack, quack.  Well, there you go.  A little fags.  A little bit slow, but...  But queers down there.  I don't know.  He didn't know where to really go with that whole thing.  But there you have it.  Another mention on his show for us, which is great.  All right.  Let's go to Danny first here.  Danny.  What's going on, Danny?  What's going on, Danny?  The Pets have made their way to the police checkpoint.  Okay. 
[00:50:30]  Uh-huh.  And I'm waiting to see if they get through with all of their paraphernalia.  Okay.  Let me see if I can have them make some noise for you guys.  All right.  Hey, Todd, give it up.  No.  Stupid.  Stupid.  Say something, idiot.  It's one, two.  One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten, eleven.  Twelve, thirteen, fourteen, fifteen.  Oh, okay. 
[00:51:00]  Sixteen, seventeen, eighteen, nineteen, running out twenty.  About twenty-five.  All right.  The cow's going to slaughter.  Now, hopefully they'll make it through the police checkpoint with all their stuff.  We're waiting to check on that.  All right, hold on one second, Dan.  I'm going to get right back to you.  Let's go to Club Soda, Kenny.  Kenny, what's going on?  Well, you got your loyal listeners are slowly infiltrating.  They're right here.  There's wow stickers plastered all over the place. 
[00:51:30]  And you got about a hundred signs and a few people chanting all in the alley.  And they're slowly making their way towards the stage.  All right, very good.  Yeah, so they're doing their way for themselves.  They're holding their own.  They're holding their own so far?  Yeah, yeah, so far so good.  All right, well, maybe we'll make something out of this after all.  Yeah, it looks pretty cool.  I have faith in the PES.  We're making a lot of fun today, but I have faith in what they're about to accomplish.  We saw a news clip today when we were in the office before the show of Howie's appearance. 
[00:52:00]  Where was that?  What park was that downtown?  Union Square.  Union Square.  And right there in that clip were a bunch of the O&A pests holding up the signs.  There you have it.  So it's doable.  It's very doable.  Let's get back to Danny.  Danny?  Hey.  Hey.  What's going on?  What's going on, Danny?  They're slowly making their way up to the police checkpoint.  It'll probably still be a few minutes before we see if they're allowed to keep all their junk. 
[00:52:30]  All right.  You want to just call us back then?  Yeah, I'll give you guys a ring back in a few minutes.  All right, Danny, we'll call us back.  Club Soda Kenny, anything else to add?  No, no, no.  I'll call you back in a little while.  All right.  There goes Club Soda Kenny as well.  Sounded urgent.  Of course.  He's on top of the whole thing there.  All right.  Jesus Christ.  What's wrong, Anthony?  I'm just, you know, Godspeed.  Godspeed, pests.  They're working their way toward the stage.  In other words, they're getting themselves surrounded. 
[00:53:00]  That's pretty much what they're doing.  They're leaving themselves no way out.  That's it.  Like the end of glory.  Yeah.  That's it.  I think they'll do all right.  The final charge, and then it's over, Danny.  I say have a little faith.  I have faith in them.  Just a little faith.  A little.  Let's see what happens, okay?  Mm-hmm.  All right.  We should take another break.  You got something to play going into break?  Yeah.  You all right, Eric?  Yeah.  What's wrong today? 
[00:53:30]  Not feeling good.  Why aren't you feeling good?  I'm all congested.  Oh, boy.  Where?  Chest or a head?  Head.  Oh, all right.  That's not quite as bad as chest.  Drinking too much?  No, not at all.  What happened?  Is it too much mayo?  Too much mayo.  What happened to you this morning?  This is a fascinating little story.  That's right.  Get our mic.  He was running around getting stuff for the show, but this is a pretty amazing story.  Holy crap.  I almost forgot about this.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I got to just preface this by saying it's an absolute zoo around this building and down 
[00:54:00]  the street, obviously, as well.  Between Howie's people and the pests out front here, it's crazy.  It's crazy, yes.  Trying to figure out how I was going to get in this morning because it was on and off about  the strike, so I went and got the car service.  That's not far from where I live.  Uh-huh.  The car's bringing me in, is not paying attention, rounds the corner, coming off 6th onto 57th,  plows into this lady that was crossing the street.  A pedestrian.  Yeah.  Bounces off the front of the car into the street, and she's just laying there. 
[00:54:30]  The guy just parks the car, gets out, picks her up, and walks her over.  She's like dazed and everything.  I get out of the van, you know what, because I'm freaking out.  Uh-huh.  He hops back in the van and takes off.  Hit and run.  Hit and run.  And as he's taking off, there was a NYPD traffic van, saw what happened, and went right  after him, and that's the last we saw.  So there's everybody just standing around the corner there, and this lady's just not,  she's like frozen.  Like, doesn't know what happened.  Wow. 
[00:55:00]  And that's all we know so far.  I called the car company, explained what happened.  They said, oh, we're going to get right on top of it.  Haven't heard from them yet, so.  She's going to sue you for that 100 grand you won.  That's how it works.  That's how it works.  I wasn't driving.  Sue everybody.  Sue everybody.  Yeah, that was.  The damage is here.  It happened right outside the studio this morning.  Yeah.  Crazy.  All right.  We're going to take a break.  You see Big Ace here, and Twitchells, or what is his name?  Twitchells.  Twitchells.  Twitchells.  It's a gimmicky name.  They're going to do the news again today. 
[00:55:30]  They're going to do like a week in review of the best stories of the week.  Yeah.  That was so much fun last week, but we waited way too long to get into that bit.  Ran out of time.  So we're going to do it early today.  We're going to try to do that hopefully in the next half hour, okay?  Right.  All right.  Plenty of shows still to come.  Gather round the campfire, kids, and toast yourself a marshmallow.  Settle in for another telltale from your old Uncle Al, Al Jorgensen.  One time, I wound up at this party with Ronald Reagan Jr.  Yeah.  Okay, so the first thing I asked him was like, have you ever beat off in the White House? 
[00:56:00]  I mean, it's like, I had to ask.  Is that the first?  That's the very first thing, because I've always wondered that.  It's like, you know, did you put on Nancy's dresses and kind of whack it and like pretend  to pick up the red phone and start a nuclear war?  Some kind of crazy shit, right?  Sure.  So I asked him that.  Give him a lollipop.  And he was like, no, no, no, no, no.  I never beat off in the White House.  I'm like, get out of here.  That's the first thing I would do if I ever was invited to the White House.  I'd go beat off in every room.  It'd just be a gas, right?  Jacking in the Lincoln bedroom.  Jacking in the Lincoln room, right? 
[00:56:30]  But he denied it.  So I finally just kept on him and on him.  He goes, all right, all right, all right.  When I was nine and my dad lived in the governor's office, I did let my Labrador retrievers pee  on me on the front lawn.  I'm like, you'll admit to that, but you won't admit to whacking it in the  White House.  There's a golden shower from his dog.  That's bogged up, man.  Strange guy.  Yeah, he is.  Well, we're done spinning yarns today, kids.  And it's a good thing, too, because there's a bottle of sarsaparilla with my name on it.  Come back soon for another tall tale from your old Uncle Al, Al Jorgensen. 
[00:57:00]  Speak and destroy.  Speak and destroy.  This should be our theme song today, but so far, it's...  Speak and destroy.  Nah.  Nah.  A lot of reports coming in.  Yeah.  Uh, my God, the pests suck. 
[00:57:30]  Well, they're...  Oh, they don't sit.  They're trying.  They're doing what they can right now.  Look, it's a huge day for Howie.  We know that.  He did morning radio in New York City for 20 years.  It's definitely his day.  We understand that.  But if we could be a bother, if we could be pests today, that's all.  That's all we want to accomplish.  We know our backs are against the wall.  Of course.  Let's go get a report from Danny.  Danny, what's going on?  Hey, fellas.  Hey. 
[00:58:00]  Uh, well, the latest update is, uh, the latest cock-blocking maneuver from fucking Sterno  is that, uh, he's ordered, uh, the nice police officers here to escort all of the, uh,  pests and their paraphernalia out of the, uh, barricaded area, and they've been escorted  to the rear on a public street.  So, it's just the latest in a series of, uh, cock-blocking maneuvers by Stern and Sirius.  Ah, so the pests aren't even, uh, in striking range? 
[00:58:30]  No, I mean, the fear, his fucking fear is just so rampant that I'm sure the minute he  saw the yellow and black signs, he just, uh, gave the order.  What is he worried about?  I don't know.  He's, I mean, I'm...  I'm so upset now, just because he is such a fucking pussy.  Wow, look at Danny, uh, showing some anger.  He is.  He's a cock-blocking little cunt.  Ooh.  Ooh.  Because this is, this is like Danny's thing.  He loves this stuff.  Right, of course.  Oh, well, yeah, of course.  And, you know, who, you know, if you got the balls, you know, let these guys through. 
[00:59:00]  If you're not afraid, let them try and make a dent, because if, you know, if you talk all  this shit, and if you believe it, then you have nothing to be worried about.  So, obviously, he's worried, and, uh, he's trying to filter out all of our, uh, all of  our tests.  All right, do you guys have a plan B?  I've got to talk to them.  I haven't.  Dude, they didn't have a plan A.  Let's be real here.  All right.  Their plan A was the cardboard coffin.  It stinks.  All right, listen.  So, maybe they didn't have a plan A, but maybe they're waiting for the plan B. 
[00:59:30]  Yeah.  All right?  They are holding their ground in the rear of the, uh, barricade.  That's great.  That's terrific.  They can't be kicked off a public street, so.  Oh, well.  Government property.  They're back to little kids taunting each other.  All right.  Well, hopefully you guys will figure something out.  Thank you, Danny.  You got it.  All right.  There goes Danny.  Very, very upset.  Uh, we're being, uh, cock-blocked at this moment in time.  Let's go to Jeff in Kentucky.  What's up, Jeff? 
[01:00:00]  Hey, Owen, Nate.  What's happening?  Oh, we're rocking.  We're having a good time.  Hey, I just want to say, hey, Patrice.  You.  Hey, uh, I, you, you just absolutely kill on this show, and I agree with that last caller,  that one caller.  Take a vote, because I think Patrice needs to be Jimmy's replacement when he's gone.  Bill Burr's good, but Patrice absolutely fucking kills.  Yeah, Patrice.  I love you guys.  All right, Patrice has given us two solid weeks, I got to tell you.  What is, uh, Jimmy is out in, in L.A., uh, just hobnobbing, by the way. 
[01:00:30]  Have you seen some of the pictures that are popping up on his MySpace?  Hobnobbing and calling us less.  Now, uh, the latest one, well, the last one was him and, um, Scarlett Johansson.  She was there, uh, there, they got their arm around each other.  He's, uh, it looks like, uh, something out of page six.  Where did he meet Scarlett Johansson?  I don't know.  But then the latest picture, you go there, it's like every day now.  Uh, it's him and, uh, I believe Dave Grohl, uh, uh, hanging out. 
[01:01:00]  Where's he seeing all these people?  Hollywood Jimmy.  You know Jimmy.  He schmoozes.  And he gets into Hollywood.  There he is.  He sees Dave Grohl.  He's, Jimmy goes up to him, probably put his hand on his arm and went, Dave, could I get a picture with you?  In that pathetic way that he does it.  Well, you should call the show.  The new one?  Jimmy has pictures of everybody that he took pictures of.  It's on a wall.  I've never seen somebody in somebody's house where all the pictures are. 
[01:01:30]  He always looks like, who's that guy?  And he's, who's that guy?  It's like, oh, shit, that's the guy from Kiss.  And who's this guy?  Oh, it's you.  I'm sorry, I'm in your apartment.  It's you.  Right.  It's a little creepy, actually.  Yeah, Jimmy looks like he's CGI'd and, like, what?  Yeah, they Photoshop it all.  Jimmy, we all have, go online, put the person's name in the images, search on Google, and Photoshop yourself in.  We all have celebrity photos.  He has a whole wall.  It's huge.  From top to bottom, filled. 
[01:02:00]  Prominently displayed.  You know where mine are?  They're in a closet or in a little photo album.  I have one celebrity photo that I hang in my apartment.  It's of me and Sam Kinison from back in the day.  That's the only one that I have laying around.  The rest, they're all in a closet.  I don't even have hard copies of mine.  They're all on disk somewhere.  Let's go to Scott.  Yeah, what's up?  What's going on, buddy?  Not too much.  We're actually sitting outside.  The cops pushed us all to the stores, and we can't see what's really going on the stage. 
[01:02:30]  But some blonde broad, I don't know who she is.  What?  Some blonde broad did what to you?  Some blonde bimbo is on the stage?  Yeah, I don't know who she is.  We got pushed into all the stores by the police.  All right, now they're getting pushed into stores.  Yeah, great.  Yeah.  All right.  Good time.  All right.  Thank you, Scott.  Call you back in a little bit.  Morale sounds a little low, Opie, in the Army.  A little low right now.  A little low.  That call right there was just, I don't know, we can't get through the lines. 
[01:03:00]  It's pretty ugly up there.  That guy sounded defeated.  Tim?  You think Doug's anywhere?  Hey, guys, what's going on?  No.  Tim, what's up?  Oh, yeah, we're inside the pen.  The cops are stopping everybody with any type of ornate paraphernalia, but we were able  to get in with a couple of things.  So there's about four of us who are represented right now.  Oh, only four made it through?  Yeah, I'm with Bill Fitzpatrick right here.  Me, him, and two other guys.  All right.  So we're trying to push our way up forward, but everybody's pushing us backwards. 
[01:03:30]  All right.  Well, keep calling us with reports, okay?  All right.  We're going to go for our attack in a moment.  All right.  Thank you.  All right.  All right.  I have faith.  I think they're going to make it.  Thanks, Igor.  Thank you.  What?  Thank you, Igor.  I appreciate the support on the show.  Oh, I'm on?  Yeah, Igor.  You're on?  You're calling the show, so you've got to be a fan of the program.  What's up, Igor?  All right, you morons.  All right.  You talk about Howard all the time and say he's nothing anymore, but you focus your entire 
[01:04:00]  show about him.  Igor, we do not.  You don't even have one person on the fan base.  Igor, we don't focus our entire show on Howard Stern.  Stop it.  Stop lying.  You lie like you're a leader.  Stop lying.  So, uh...  Do we take shots at him on a daily basis?  Sure.  It probably takes up about five to ten minutes, and that's the fact.  He's in the news because he's going over to Satellite.  There's nothing about him.  Igor, then why are you listening to us?  You're calling our show.  You know the phone number and everything.  Thanks for listening.  I appreciate it, Igor.  I don't have XM.  All right.  He doesn't have XM.  I don't have XM.  He doesn't have XM, but he knows how to get a hold of us. 
[01:04:30]  And we don't even give out the phone number.  The only way you call this program is to see it on your goddamn display.  We've never given up.  I don't know the phone number.  I have no idea how to get a hold of this show if I didn't see the number on my display.  That's the beauty of Satellite Radio.  You don't have to give out the phone number to call in.  It's a big news story.  We talk about the news.  That's right.  Jay in Philly, what's up?  Yo, we're down here about...  You need to tell Danny and crew to grow some fucking balls because about six of us got through. 
[01:05:00]  Signs of middle fingers and all.  All right.  So you got some stuff in?  Oh, we got in.  See?  This is what I want to hear.  Now we got a little more energy going on here.  We plowed right through the barricades, and we're in.  All right, Jay.  Good luck to you, sir.  No problem, dude.  I wish I could walk the line, pat his face, and go, I wish I had a thousand men just like  you, like Hitler did, with the little Hitler youth.  He's a soldier.  That guy's like, what the f...  What?  Love that.  He's a real soldier right there.  We fucking stopped a cop. 
[01:05:30]  He's fucking on the...  We got a cop tied up.  We cut his ear off.  Hitler walking the line when Berlin is just in flames and blowing up, and there's this 12-year-old  kid in the uniform that's manning a gun, a battery, anti-aircraft, and he just taps  him on the cheek.  Like, I wish I had a thousand men just like you.  Not realizing, you know, it's going to be rough with the crew you got there, Dolph.  He's like, how'd I get to the barricade? 
[01:06:00]  I don't fucking know, man.  Don't burn me.  I don't care how much you scream.  I'm still going to torture you.  Let's go to Neil in Jersey.  Hey, I just want to wish all the best luck, man.  You guys are great.  Take luck.  Cut his ear off, and then he goes, hello?  Hello?  Talks into it.  I don't know.  I don't know how to get into the barricades.  I don't give a shit what you don't know. 
[01:06:30]  You finished?  You done?  Yeah.  You done?  Finished.  Finished.  The most ruthless motherfucker in any movie.  You done?  Finished?  You done?  You finished?  Done.  What's your name?  Marvin Nash.  Don't burn me.  Let's get Twitchels in here.  He's all nervous because of all the excitement and action around the studio today.  Oh, my God.  He is losing his mind.  Twitchels.  Twitchels is going to do the weekend review of the news or whatever with Big A. 
[01:07:00]  The boys are still writing it.  Gab's going to be mad.  Oh, he's going to be sad.  And that should be on the radio in the next 15, 20 minutes.  I think Cowhead's a Tony Soprano-looking motherfucker, isn't he?  Yeah, we're going to have to say hi to Cowhead, too.  There's so many people coming in and out.  Yeah.  What's up, Twitchels?  Yeah, what's up, guys?  You all right?  I'm hanging in there.  I'm actually a lot calmer today.  Feeling really good.  Everyone said you were really freaked out.  What do you mean freaked out?  Between the rain and all the fans that are coming and going.  Well, no, that was pretty exciting, seeing all the commotion about everything going on today. 
[01:07:30]  But for the most part, I guess it's because it's early.  I'm pretty calm.  Yeah.  Huh.  You're going to have to fix that.  I think this is so entertaining.  I was just saying, you know, they're going to fuck with me to no end until it gets it up  going again, and that's fine with me.  But right now, I really feel really good.  You think you could talk without freaking out, man?  Well, you know, like I said, I have people who know me, you know, you just did that.  Just add it in.  When I can't do it, machine it.  No, but, you know, like I said, some people who know me, they, you know, they say they're  already asleep today. 
[01:08:00]  Well, some people say, like, they've known me for years and, you know, forget that I  have it sometimes because, like I said, good days and bad days.  So, last time I was here, I was stuck under a tunnel for 45 minutes.  Right.  So, that kind of triggered my nerves.  But, yeah, I'm pretty cool.  I'm pretty cool today.  Do you want to have a couple Red Bulls?  Maybe.  Oh, there's one.  Oh, I know.  He doesn't need, it's just.  You have confidence?  You know what, to be honest with you, I've never had a Red Bull.  I don't know what they taste like.  I was advised by my people not to even try them. 
[01:08:30]  Oh, they're terrific.  Good stuff.  They're terrific.  They'll pep you up a little bit.  Yeah, don't eat it.  Well, that's what the last person said.  They brought a bunch of Red Bulls.  It was at a cash party and they said, you know, just keep away from it.  You have enough energy.  All right.  But I want to try it.  So far, so good.  Yeah.  Are you on medication this morning?  Well, that's just snuck out there.  He's got to get, yeah.  He's got to get a couple.  You don't need it.  No.  He's calm.  Go ahead.  Tell him what's going on.  He's calm because, let me tell you, man, here's the problem with Lou, with Twitchels. 
[01:09:00]  Uh-huh.  He really wants to defeat his Tourette's.  Uh-huh.  He thinks he's better than his Tourette's.  And the Tourette's wants to let everybody know that the Tourette's is better than him.  Is in charge.  And it will not fucking die.  He's just calm because he's not trying to be funny.  There's nothing going on.  No pressure.  Hey, guys.  How you doing?  He's been here two weeks in a row, three weeks, whatever.  Hey, how you doing?  Good to see you.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Good to see you, Ant.  Hey, how you doing, Virginia?  Hey, I'm cool.  Once he starts to get into this, I'm telling you, the boings and bings are going to be 
[01:09:30]  fucking flying out of his mouth.  Trust me.  You know what, dude?  You hit it right on the head, Patrice, because I think what's going on is I feel more comfortable  now.  I know you guys.  He knows you as a person.  But at the same time, but at the same time, you're right, I always, I accept who I am.  You're like, I always say this.  I'm glad I have Tourette's.  Not glad.  But you know what?  If God deals your hand, you gotta work it the best you can.  But for the most part, for the most part, I am trying to control it, but there does get  to a point where it's like, fuck it, it's gonna happen. 
[01:10:00]  A very special episode of boing.  That's what happens.  It's gotta be like, boing.  It's a very special episode of boing.  Did I tell you guys that I've been getting a lot of people signing my guest book?  Like, I got like 40, 50 people, and at the end of each signature, they sign it B-R-R-R-I-N-G.  Ah, there you go.  It's genius.  You guys, people be like, oh, that was mean.  It's like, why be anybody obscure with a problem that you're gonna get laughed at in obscurity 
[01:10:30]  anyway?  Exactly.  Imagine walking around boinging and don't have a chance to be known.  At least you can go in a restaurant, boinging, and whatever.  I'm gonna go, oh, my God.  That's what you're talking about.  That's what you're talking about.  It's like, here's a free steak or whatever.  That's what you're talking about.  That's what you're talking about.  That's what you're talking about.  That's what you're talking about.  That's what you're talking about.  Yeah, you gotta take it.  Take it in strides.  I don't care that I have this, and, you know, obviously.  Well, we have a lot of action around the studio today.  This is, I don't know, there's 20, 30 people wandering around the offices right now,  so maybe we'll just bring them all in to check out the news live.  Yeah, why not?  Why not?  Oh, you're gonna add the pressure? 
[01:11:00]  Is that what you're trying to do?  Of course we are.  A little bit.  All right, Twitchels.  We'll see you in a little while.  Thanks, man.  We gotta say hi to No Filter Paul.  He's at the rally.  Paul, what's going on?  Hey.  Hey, what's up?  We got about 20 people in each pen, and they all just pulled out their ONA signs and started  churning.  They crap shit their pants.  All the cops are trying to drag up signs off us.  Yeah, our fucking cops are assholes over here.  That's what you want to do, is call the cops assholes.  Jeez.  We didn't do anything wrong.  We followed all the rules.  You know, we're not starting fights. 
[01:11:30]  You know, we're doing exactly what we were told.  Yeah, so what's going on?  We just started.  We had the whole crowd doing an ONA sign just now, and the serious guys were not organized  at all.  Couldn't hear them at all.  We're riding down in the first pen.  I don't want to kind of give away where I am, because obviously there's going to be people  listening, you know?  All right, so we're pushing back a little bit.  No, we're going to be down to fight in a minute with a couple of big banners.  Hopefully when the highway comes out, you'll see us.  All right, thank you, Paul.  No, Paul, have a good day.  All right, look, man.  They're pushing back.  Well, they're coming to their rally, and they've regrouped for another charge. 
[01:12:00]  Right.  Damn.  They're already bringing the wounded back to the offices here.  I see triages set up in the big office that we...  Oh, man, it did sound like a war movie, didn't it?  We're getting there.  You're going to stand and fight, soldier.  We're getting there.  We're falling back.  Falling back to what?  Stay there and fight.  If anyone's familiar with the Civil War, just think Pickett's Charge.  Yeah, exactly what I was thinking.  Think Pickett's Charge.  They sure thought they had that in hand. 
[01:12:30]  We don't have to run.  Let's walk across the field.  Let's just walk across this open field.  They're doing well so far.  We'll see what happens as this moves on.  That smell.  Hey.  I love that smell.  That gasoline smell.  Smells like...  Hoo-hoo.  Hoo-hoo.  Hoo-hoo.  Let's go to Jason in Wisconsin.  Jason, what's up?  This morning.  Did Opie have all the best come in?  Take a knee and bow in silence while you said, good luck, bros. 
[01:13:00]  Good luck, bros.  I'm not throwing out any good luck, bros, today.  I think we're doing just fine so far.  Just fine.  I'm playing it.  All right.  Considering the circumstances, we're doing just fine.  Really fast, Anthony.  We've got to remind people we're doing the homeless shopping spree.  We're doing it this coming Tuesday.  Yes.  Mark this down.  We're doing our show from a different time.  This is an event.  It's an event, and I don't want people to be confused out there, so spread the word for  us.  Spread this info. 
[01:13:30]  This coming Tuesday, we're doing an afternoon show from 3 p.m. to 7 p.m. East Coast time.  It's us bringing a bus of homeless people.  It's going to be filled up to the Palisades Mall in West Nyack.  It's our homeless shopping spree.  So they're going to be at the Palisades Mall in West Nyack, and we're broadcasting the show.  Wow.  This coming Tuesday from 3 to 7 p.m.  Get it on our website.  Afternoons.  Wow.  That'll be nice for a day.  That's the key, because people are going to be tuning in.  Well, I guess if they tune in the morning, we'll have all sorts of promos saying, hey,  we'll be live that day, so it shouldn't be too bad. 
[01:14:00]  But we also want a lot of the guests and the listeners to show up at the Palisades Mall  in West Nyack this coming Tuesday from 3 to 7.  You'll get to see the bus pull up with all the homeless, and they got, actually, they got  American Express gift cards this year.  Oh, they did?  And they got $202 each to spend on Christmas presents.  That's nice.  And then the listeners, you guys do your job every year, or every time we've done this,  and you guys start buying the homeless some stuff, too.  So that's pretty cool.  You know, we're going to do the show.  I'm going to have to leave and go to sleep. 
[01:14:30]  So I could get up for the next day's morning show.  I should just get a hotel.  Yeah, maybe I'll do that.  So once again, this coming Tuesday, a different show time, 3 to 7 p.m. East Coast time, of  course, and we're bringing the homeless to the Palisades Mall in West Nyack, so we're  looking for a lot of listeners and pets to show up to support the homeless shopping spree  this year, okay?  I'm sure they're thrilled over there.  And spread that word for us, because we haven't done a good job promoting that yet.  No.  Not at all.  Got to let the people know. 
[01:15:00]  Well, we've had so much going on, it's tough to keep track of all of it.  Oh, and Bill Burr and Rich Voss are going to help us with the homeless shopping spree.  They're going to join the homeless at the mall as they're shopping, okay?  Cannot wait.  Hey, we got another loud orgasm that came in.  Where's Steve?  What are these things, the new thing to do in porno?  I saw the video clip of the first one.  Yeah.  It's hysterical.  Well, play the first one.  Do you have it, or I have it, too, I guess?  I think we both have it, yeah.  Do you have the long version?  The long version? 
[01:15:30]  Well, they cut it down for our machines, but it goes on for like 30 seconds.  Hawk, you got the long version of that first loud orgasm?  I got the short version, I think.  Yeah, we got it, we got it.  We'll find it, Steve.  So what's the new one?  It's Alicia Class?  Alicia Class.  Alicia.  This is a scene from, I think this was shot sometime in 97 or 98.  It's her and, of course, it's her and Seymour Butts in a hotel room. 
[01:16:00]  Seymour Butts.  Oh, this is, I got this, this is the squirtin' thing.  Yeah.  She's like a professional squirt, Alicia.  Yeah?  He makes her come through, like, he fingers her butthole.  Yeah.  And she'll come, she'll squirt.  Oh, wow.  Yeah, she's like, she got, there's a video with like 40 clips of her.  Yeah.  It's called Seymour Butts squirting.  That's all she does.  Yeah, that's all she does is squirt.  Yeah, so this chick is kind of cool.  Alicia's this female squirter, like he says in this hotel room footage, it's just, they're 
[01:16:30]  putting two hands up each other, it's in every hole of these girls and they're just projectile  ejaculating all over the room.  Yeah, so.  And this is just one of those.  The latest thing on this show is to find loud orgasms.  Is that hot?  I don't think so.  I think it's funny.  I think the audience is funny.  It's funny, it's interesting to watch, but as far as going, god damn, that is so fucking  hot, he's got two hands in her and she's erupting and it's just, no, no, not hot.  Patrice is saying yes.  Why is that hot? 
[01:17:00]  Interesting.  I don't know.  Not hot.  I don't even want, I'm scared to say it.  It might be, you know, some psychologist goes, some other story.  People get into, no, no, I'm not enough fucking.  Oh my God.  I put my elbow on her, bitch.  Well, but it's like, it's, I don't know, man, it's just filthy.  I like to see girls just doing the filthiest shit ever.  Yeah.  And, um, this particular girl is a girl that got my, my girl into girls.  Really?  So I just played a picture of this girl and she just, is just so filthy.  Yeah.  And then now my girl got, got into, she's like, how do you do that? 
[01:17:30]  And I said, I know how to do it.  I mean, you know, let me give you a, show you.  Does your girl ever suggest bringing girls in?  Uh, yeah.  She likes girls.  Yeah?  Yeah.  All right.  Hey, uh, by the way, not to interrupt, but Twitchell's is drinking a Red Bull for the  first time in his life.  You shouldn't.  You shouldn't.  That's really smart.  All right.  Well, so the loud orgasm thing started with this clip.  Yeah.  We got to play this thing again.  I got the long version, Anthony.  For everyone's listening. 
[01:18:00]  This one is so funny to watch the video of.  Oh yeah.  You saw the video.  Recording something in Steve's studio and Steve had it running on a loop in his studio.  And, uh, it really is.  The guy just tenses up, uh, arches his back, lifts his head up.  He's banging this chick and lets out this horrific yell.  And the girl underneath turns her head and starts laughing.  Oh really?  She starts laughing because it's, it's a ridiculous orgasm. 
[01:18:30]  But you can't really hear it over his screaming.  Well, here is, uh, the loudest orgasm.  Oh, there is a crap.  Damn it.  Shit.  Oh.  Oh. 
[01:19:00]  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  damn  that guy didn't scream that much in uh alien when the fucking thing popped out of his stomach  right right he did not scream that much that is really funny who comes like that

[01:40:00]  i blew a guy last year  but then gabriel said to mary  my child have no fear  you can suck all the dick you want  and still be a virgin  mary  you can suck all the dick you want  and still not be considered flawed  although you went to town  and suck some semen down  you're still a virgin in the eyes of god 
[01:40:30]  there was no room at the inn  when mary and joseph did arrive  but they were so very tired  you see and mary had to offer a bribe  since she had no money  how would she pay for a place to sleep  gabriel appeared to mary  and told her not to weep  cause you can suck all the dick you want  and still be a virgin  mary  mary you can suck all the dick you want 
[01:41:00]  and still be the mother of christ  if there's no room at the inn  then it's not considered a sin  to suck some dick to get a room for the night  then three wise men did appear  bearing gifts of myrrh and such  they said that they had followed a star  and missed a woman's touch  mary thought she might pleasure them 
[01:41:30]  but could not take them too bad  but again gabriel appeared to her  and this is what he said  he said  you can suck all the dick you want  and still be a virgin  mary  you can suck all the dick you want  everyone that hangs in the nation  fellatio ain't no sin  gonna blow those three wise men  and you'll still be a virgin  cause there was no penetration  so you can suck all the dick you want 
[01:42:00]  and still be a virgin  mary  mary  the donkey  and the ox  and the lambs  and even the little drummer boy  people will remember your name quick  they'll say  damn that bitch could suck a good dick  cause sucking dick brings  peace on earth and joy  cause sucking dick brings  peace on earth and joy 
[01:42:30]  mary mary suck that dick  like sand through the hourglass  so is the ONA virus  a slightly kinky  but fun thing you can try  get naked on the bed  then you wrap your partner  from head to toe  in plastic wrap  make sure you leave a breathing hole  or you may get a little more excitement  than you bargained for  and then you wrap him or her 
[01:43:00]  up like a mummy  so they're totally immobile  and then you start licking  and kissing  and sucking  and blowing  all over  front and back  and every nook and cranny  you can find  then you get a small whisk broom  and you gently rake it  all over the body  like a rake of whiskey  those little nerve endings  and these will just be a jumping  now silk is a better wrapping 
[01:43:30]  material for this escapade  because it allows the skin to breathe  but for a short period  of foreplay  the good old  plastic wrap  from the kitchen  will do  enjoy  that old broad  doesn't know anything  nibble  and lick  and blow  and kiss  every nook and cranny  nook and cranny  again  not a sexy dialogue  she's got old lady mouth  because everything's loose in there  everything's all loose 
[01:44:00]  her teeth are flapping around  her gums  trying to keep everything in place  she's got the bone density  of a rolling paper  and her teeth  are all just loose  and flapping around  and just lick  and suck  and  caress  every nook and cranny  what is that voice  she puts on  oh  and let me tell you  once you bring out  the whiskey room  things are gonna get sexy 
[01:44:30]  oh  oh  really johnny  oh  that could be the unsexiest thing  I've ever  ever heard  wrap your loved one up in plastic  they're gonna love laying on the bed  as you just caress  and then grab that whisk room  and get the nerve endings  to come alive  as you whisk the most gentleman part  grandpa  grandpa  get the whisk room

[01:45:30]  Are you kidding me?  One of our favorite people has just entered the studio.  It's Gavin.  Gavin, how tall are you?  I'm 6'5".  Yeah, 6'5".  He's just all muscle.  He's Patrice's friend, and he's now our friend as well.  He heard that big ass.  One of these striking, good-looking guys.  He's dressed all well and everything.  English.  Yeah, what kind of coat is that?  I'll tell him he's fucking dressed all.  He is dressed.  Look at that coat. 
[01:46:00]  His dress stinks.  Look at the coat.  Get on, Mike.  It's all, Mike.  It's like, what is that, London fog?  He really thinks he's a dapper Englishman, and it really bugs me.  That looks good.  That's a nice jacket.  I do like that jacket.  You're a hey-gabbage dress.  Your Sorns, that's all it is.  6X.  Sorry if he doesn't have a fucking sports team on it.  A color that isn't even on the visual spectrum.  Stop, stop.  It's like, Patrice, why are you wearing something without color?  No, bitch, this has like ultraviolet, and fucking, it's a color spectrum you can't see, motherfucker. 
[01:46:30]  I do like that coat.  I usually get it.  That coat is huge.  That's got class.  It's like a 2X.  Can I get a picture of myself in your coat?  We like to do that.  Jesus.  I got a picture of myself in Patrice's coat, and it's online.  I got to get one with Gavin.  If you want to feel how big this coat is at home, take your comforter and wrap it around you.  That's how big your freaking coat is, man.  Why aren't you in every movie that's me? 
[01:47:00]  I can't look at that.  I don't know.  You should be in my office.  I'm always in his shadow.  Action scenes.  Action scenes.  You were almost in Snatch?  Yeah, I was.  Yeah, it was amazing.  I missed it by a plane ride.  Literally did.  My friend's a bodyguard of Guy Ritchie, and he rung me up and said, listen, we're going  to be in a movie, and the movie was going to be called Diamonds before it was going to  be called Snatch.  And I said, no, that's going to stink.  It's not going to work out.  Don't worry about it.  Next thing you know, it's one of the biggest movies out of England.  I love Snatch.  Gav looks like no one I've ever seen. 
[01:47:30]  That's the thing.  It's just he has a look, man.  He's like, you walk down the street with Gav, you cannot not look at him.  It's like a tough guy look, but yet it's charming.  I don't know how he pulls it off.  He looks like he wrestles alligators just for a living.  And he's like, hey, Mike, how you doing?  Nice to see you, Mike.  Cheers.  Cheers, Mike.  All right, we've got to go to Doug Out Doug.  He's got a report from the past in the O&A Army.  Doug, what's going on?  It's taken me a couple hours, but I've found a good way to put a nice positive spin on this.  Okay.  If you get Howard and all of his fans together, and they say they want to make the world's 
[01:48:00]  biggest chocolate chip cookie, well, if we take and sprinkle five or six pubes  in it, it's ruined, right?  All you need are five pubes.  So we are going for quality today.  And, you know, they got a few early shots off with blocking some of us from getting in  there with our stuff.  But like the Borg and Star Trek, we've adjusted and we're moving on.  All right.  Yeah.  Oh, my God.  He's making Borg Star Trek references.  Well, Steve's ready to throw up a bunch of pictures.  We're doing just fine down there today. 
[01:48:30]  Yeah.  I don't think it's going that bad at all.  And I do have a plan B for afterwards.  If you guys get blocked at the Hard Rock, right across the street and down a little bit  is ESPN's The Zone.  Yeah.  Some of our buddies that have been making some pretty nasty photoshops of us personally and  some of our favorite radio show hosts, they'll be gathering at ESPN's The Zone to have lunch  after this whole shenanigans go off also.  And there is nothing illegal about standing behind these guys and watching them eat. 
[01:49:00]  So I invite some of the pets to go down there and visit if you can't get into the Hard Rock.  All right.  Thank you, Doug.  God bless.  There's a report from the, I don't know.  Where is Doug?  The trenches.  He's not in the trenches.  Where is he?  He's with the secretaries.  NORAD?  He's at NORAD, yes.  He's in the mountain.  Somewhere in the mountain.  He's getting the communique.  Okay.  All right.  Well, this is, Gavin came running into the studio today because he heard Big A's going 
[01:49:30]  to be here.  Big A, you love Big A?  You're a fan of Big A?  Big fan.  Big fan.  Big A is massive in England right now.  Yeah.  But you can't explain it when you're talking on the phone to people about how funny this  guy is.  You've got to see him.  You've got to see the visual.  Yeah.  It's like the Grand Canyon.  Unbelievable.  You know, you could say, hey, it's a big hole in the ground.  You know, the water carved it out, the colors, it's so wide.  Big A is big in Birmingham.  But until you see it, you can't really appreciate it.  He's massive.  Yeah.  All right.  He talks.  And we've got Twitchells, too.  Twitchells, he's had two Red Bulls and a couple cups of coffee. 
[01:50:00]  Because we weren't happy.  He came in here.  He was too mellow.  It's all smooth and relaxed.  It's all smooth, man.  All fucking, all Sammy Davis.  Yeah.  Is he still got contagious cuturettes, is he?  Oh, yeah.  The guy next to him is twitching.  Yeah.  I don't know.  All right.  You want to bring these guys in?  He's tremendous.  We also have Cowhead in studio.  He came by to say hi.  Okay.  Cowhead got fired.  He got fired from his radio show.  Yeah.  I like that shit.  Yeah.  That's my claim to fame on this show. 
[01:50:30]  You got the retard, the Tourette's guy, and the asshole who got fired.  Got fired.  But he went down.  It was classic.  What did you do on your last day again?  Oh, I mean, the last day, we didn't really do much.  I mean, I knew my last day was coming, which is rare in this business.  So, you know, we kept it kind of cool because I wanted them to keep paying me, you know?  Right, right, right.  Which until Monday happened, so.  I understand.  That's Cowhead, everyone.  Yeah.  So, hey, thank you guys for all that you did for us.  Your pests have been fucking unreal for us.  Oh, they're great.  We've got a whole audience of people who can't hear us, so thank you. 
[01:51:00]  Yeah.  They're waiting in the wings.  Yeah.  We've got to figure a lot of things out still.  Let's go to No Filter, Paul.  Paul?  What's going on?  What's up, Paul?  There's about 100 of us.  We're on site K-Rock, and we've got the whole crowd shouting.  We're going to go.  We're going to go.  We're going to go.  We're going to go.  We're going to go.  That sounds like he's a bit, huh?  He did.  Yeah.  Hey.  Oh, hey.  Oh, hey. 
[01:51:30]  Oh, hey.  Oh, hey.  I'm telling you, man.  These guys have done a great job today.  Unfortunately, they are by the Empire State Building.  They've been pushed a little further away.  But, uh...  And we lost them?  I think we just lost them, too.  I have no idea what he was saying, but it sounded like it was going okay.  Something tells me we're going to need a doctor that knows how to remove a phone from an Englishman's rectum.  I want to find out what's going on with the coffin that they spent hours building. 
[01:52:00]  Oh, that's...  Uh, Paul, what happened?  I'm sorry.  We, uh, we had the whole serious crowd and us shouting, whip them out to all these girls.  They were all shouting, hope you're not.  It was really embarrassing.  It was...  Every stunt time we're shouting, whip them out.  It was great.  Over 100 of us down here right now.  All right.  You guys are doing well.  Yeah, we're going down now to this stage to fuck when it goes on in about 10, 15 minutes.  All right.  Thank you, Paul.  All right.  All right.  Keep us posted.  Keep us posted, yes.  Really fast before we get to Big A and Twitchell's... 
[01:52:30]  They're going to do the weekend review as far as the news goes.  Uh-huh.  We got Randall on the line, the winner from The Apprentice last night.  Randall!  Yes.  Good morning.  You called on a really bad day.  We got so much going on, but, uh, congratulations to you, sir.  Thank you.  I appreciate that.  I appreciate it.  You were so obvious, uh, obvious, uh, that you should have won this thing from day one.  It made the show kind of boring to...  Not boring.  I shouldn't say that, but it was obvious you were going to beat everyone in the end.  Well, I'm glad it was obvious to you.  I tell you, while I was in the process, it was, it was, uh, one of the most challenging experiences 
[01:53:00]  I've had in my life, but I was glad to emerge.  Uh, as the victor last night, it was, it was, it was so exciting last night.  What's this going to get him?  Uh, yeah.  What does it get you?  Well, I get a, a one-year job with the Trump organization, $250,000 salary.  Uh, it looks like I'll be working on a project down in Atlantic City and have the opportunity  to learn from one of America's...  What kind of project they give you, though?  It's not like they're going to say, hey, uh, revamp our, uh, casinos down there. 
[01:53:30]  What is it?  Like, you know, the toilet color at the Taj has really been bothering me for years.  What do you think?  The gold or the lavender?  What should we go with?  Yeah, how much responsibility will you have, Randall?  Well, you know, I'm actually still learning more about the specifics of, of, of the job.  Yeah.  And I expect I'll be meeting with Mr. Trump probably on, uh, Tuesday of next week so we  can sit down and...  For the last time.  Yeah.  And go through the specifics, yeah. 
[01:54:00]  Now, this guy, he's a very smart, very smart guy.  Yeah.  Very smart.  And you own a lot of businesses already, right?  Yeah, absolutely, absolutely.  So who's going to run those businesses as you work for Trump?  Well, I have, uh, an incredible executive team that, that runs my organization, and they're  going to step in and fill the void that will be left by my absence.  What kind of business?  Uh, it's, uh, information technology consulting firm.  Uh, we do...  What the fuck is that?  He's a black guy, too.  What the fuck?  Yeah, yeah.  How come you don't mention that?  Just mention it.  It's important to mention these things.  Because as a white person... 
[01:54:30]  White people always are not important.  ...it seems racist, uh, to mention it.  Like, hey, he's done it on his own merits, and why should skin color come into this?  I don't want to hear that.  I don't want to hear black first.  That's the first thing.  Hey, I'm a black guy.  I want to make it.  And then get into that shit.  If he robbed someone, it would have been the first thing we said, all right?  The guy's successful.  What a successful black man is being colorless.  You know, I didn't even notice.  The nigga was a criminal, but, you know, Jesus was black, but it doesn't matter.  White, green, it's all colorless.  By the way, Patrice is black, uh, Randall. 
[01:55:00]  Just so you know.  Like, that wasn't obvious.  He's trying to support a fellow brother.  Fuck that, Randall.  Stop running around trying not to be black.  This always announced that shit.  They got Randall thinking he shouldn't be black now.  Fuck that, nigga.  Come on, Randall.  What do you want him to say?  Come on, Randall.  Open this bitch.  You're like, yeah, ONA, I'm the executive.  I'm the executive, motherfucker.  Are you trying to be funny with toilets, nigga?  Nigga, I am revamping motherfucking toilets. 
[01:55:30]  Sorry, man.  God damn.  My girlfriend's a huge fan of Randall, by the way.  I had to tell her to calm down a few times last night.  Oh, did you?  As we were watching the finale.  Shut the TV off.  Huh?  Good-looking dude in shape.  Uh, Randall, he's a smart dude, man.  Still looking with stuff.  Very, very educated, too.  And he beat out Rebecca.  What's that supposed to mean, Opie?  Yeah.  What do I...  What?  Very educated.  Is that an odd thing?  Come on.  Come on. 
[01:56:00]  I didn't say that.  You might as well, Ab.  And I gotta say, you know, my academic credentials got a lot of airtime on the show, but what  a lot of people don't know is that, as you said earlier, that I run my own organization.  I run a consulting firm that I've been in that role for the past five years now.  So I think my business experience, in fact, rivals that of my academic credentials, which  I think was definitely one of the keys to success.  You can't be effective in an environment like the Apprentice with just academic training. 
[01:56:30]  Yeah, just schooling.  You need some real experience, right?  You gotta have real experience.  You gotta have real experience.  The highlight of the show last night, by the way, Randall and Rebecca are sitting there,  live audience, right?  Mm-hmm.  And Donald says, you know, you're hired instead of you're fired.  To Randall.  And Rebecca was a really good candidate as well.  And there was talk that he was gonna hire both of them, right?  Oh, a little twist.  So Donald Trump, and before I say this, I gotta tell you, Randall was the nice guy during  the entire show.  Everyone loved the guy.  He was really nice.  You know, so Donald basically goes to Randall, hey, should I hire Rebecca, too? 
[01:57:00]  It was basically up to Randall.  I'm sitting at home going, oh, God, here we go, because Randall's such a nice guy, he's  obviously gonna say yes.  No way.  I got the clip.  Listen to that.  Oh, it's great.  And you, I really respect, and I respect your opinion.  If you were me, would you hire Rebecca also?  All right, now the crowd is going for it.  Yeah, this is gonna be a cool ending to The Apprentice, right?  Here it comes, here it comes. 
[01:57:30]  Mr. Trump, Mr. Trump, Mr. Trump, I firmly believe that this is The Apprentice, that there  is one and only one Apprentice, and if we're going to hire someone tonight, it should be one.  Fuck that bitch.  It's not The Apprentice, it's The Apprentice.  All right.  I'm gonna leave it at that, then.  I think I could have been convinced, but you feel that's the way it should be.  I'm gonna leave it that way.  Congratulations.  Thank you.  In the end, he fucked Rebecca. 
[01:58:00]  Yeah, boy!  Another case of a black man keeping us down.  Keeping the white woman down.  God damn.  And he said, this is not The Apprentice, bitch.  Yeah, Apprentice.  I...  What?  Did I say a white woman?  Good for you.  Smart man.  Good for you.  Don't let us steal any of your line, Mike.  I applaud you, Randall.  Thank you.  And listen, I mean, think about this, fellas and ladies.  I mean, if you were given a gold medal in the Olympics, and then they told you, look,  we're gonna give you the opportunity to share that gold medal with the silver medalist, 
[01:58:30]  who in the world would agree to that?  No one.  Right, right.  Pussies, liars.  This man is honest.  That's like Special Olympics rules, where everyone wins.  But I'll say it again, the beauty of that, you came across...  To such a nice guy, looking out for everyone around you, I thought it was a no-brainer.  You're gonna go, yeah, hire her, too.  And when you turned that around, it was so sweet to watch.  Good for you.  Good for you.  That's what I'm talking about.  Yeah, I mean, I definitely had the nice guy persona throughout the season.  But I think you saw it last night throughout the boardroom, and certainly with that final 
[01:59:00]  decision, that, I mean, you know, when the going gets tough, the tough get going,  and you do what you have to do.  You make that up?  That's good.  You know there's a nickname...  We gotta get that on a t-shirt.  You know there's a nickname for you out there now?  Uppity.  Oh, Uppity.  That's great.  That's what they're gonna call you, but I'm gonna defend you, because I like that.  Don't share shit with white women.  Oh, wow.  He's new.  He's an uppity apprentice man.  That's good.  You get any shit from the community because, you know, you're assimilating to the business  world, and some guys...  What community, Anthony?  The black community. 
[01:59:30]  Oh, I'm sorry.  I just call them the community.  The community.  What other community is there?  Why don't you call them them?  Do them give you a problem, sir?  Because I know a lot of professional black young men get a lot of shit from guys because  you're not street.  You know what I mean?  Well, I've had incredible support from the black community.  I mean, as the first African-American or even person of color to win The Apprentice,  you know, I think a lot of folks felt like Kwame Jackson from season one really stood a 
[02:00:00]  strong chin.  And you guys know, you know, black men have made it to the final four for this show on  every single season, but there's yet to be a winner.  So rather than, you know, arguments about assimilation, I think folks are really proud  to see that someone with my background academically and professionally was able to perform effectively,  have an undefeated record, an undefeated project manager record, and then win The Apprentice.  Well, great.  That's a great confidence, man.  Great.  We had The Apprentice for a couple of seasons. 
[02:00:30]  Now, there that goes.  We had golf.  That's gone.  Golf, basketball, apprenticing.  They're even infiltrating hockey at this point.  God damn.  I love you.  Hey, I got to tell you, I hated that Russian broad.  Oh, our.  Hated her.  She's tough as nails, let me tell you.  Ah, she's a jerk.  Russian broads do not come across well on television.  Ever.  Ever.  And in real life, even worse.  And then in the strip clubs, even worse. 
[02:01:00]  You can't go to a strip club anymore and just get your normal, average, she lives around  the corner, white girl that's just going to dance for you.  Now it's, what do you need?  What do you need?  The sexy for you?  Do you give to me the money?  Give to me the money.  Yeah, we are making the sexy for you.  It's the most unsexy fucking thing.  Well, I got to say, I got a ton of respect for Allah.  I mean, she came to this, she came to this country with nothing and she is a multi-millionaire.  Well, good for her.  I was, I work at hospital.  I was in nuclear medicine before the fall of the wall. 
[02:01:30]  Now I have to be janitor.  But, uh, we were so much better than you and Soviet Union, uh, keep it up.  I'm not just Russian.  And every one of them was like, ever.  There wasn't one guy sweeping a fucking floor over in Russia that came here.  They were all, me?  Rocket scientist.  I invented the fuel for the Vostok rockets.  Oh, what do you do now?  Dishwasher at, uh, the TGI Fridays. 
[02:02:00]  But back in the day, I was somebody.  Oh, yeah.  I was chief of the KGB.  Much intelligence on the United States missile program.  What are you doing now?  Sometimes I fish off Brooklyn Bridge.  I got gray.  Gray, you're doing well.  Hey, Randall, what did you do last night to celebrate?  Well, you know, we had an incredible after party at Planet Hollywood.  You had all the members of the cast.  You had some of the former winners, former members of the cast. 
[02:02:30]  Mr. Trump came through for a while.  And then there was the after, after party.  Oh.  Over at Marquee, a little further downtown.  And I literally partied all through the night and then woke up this morning to, you know,  start doing these interviews.  So I've gotten no sleep.  I'm running on straight adrenaline right now.  See, and he doesn't sound hungover or tired.  Not at all.  Well, if you knew my voice, you'd know.  I'm starting to lose it just a little bit.  Hopefully, it will get me through the day. 
[02:03:00]  All right, Randall.  Congratulations, Steve.  Yep, good job.  Thanks, everyone.  I appreciate it.  And we appreciate your support throughout the season.  You guys have been great.  Ah, we had no choice.  Cool, man.  Oh, wait.  Ah.  Ah, it was some kind of sponsored deal.  Yeah.  I didn't even know the show was on until the big boss came to me and said,  hey, hint, hint, you might want to start talking about The Apprentice.  I can't tell you yet why.  And that was because Elo was on the show.  Well, but he didn't tell us that at first.  I know.  He said, trust me, watch The Apprentice and start talking about it. 
[02:03:30]  And I've got to be honest, I wasn't going to watch the show, but I did.  I got hooked, and I was really into it.  And I was rooting for you, Randall.  And XM had a fine week.  We had a lot of fun with that, so congratulations, Randall.  Thank you.  Thank you, everyone.  I really appreciate it.  All right.  There he goes.  The winner of The Apprentice, Randall.  Congrats.  Take care.  Jesus, Jesus.  It's already.  See, it's a different story.  Huffing and puffing.  Hey, we know what we're doing around here, Patrice.  Patrice is looking at me like you cold-hearted motherfucker. 
[02:04:00]  Hey, Twitchels, that's a little different now, huh?  Ah, you bastards.  That caffeine and the Red Bull.  You can't even be mad when you want to be mad, can't you?  No.  I've had two Red Bulls and a coffee.  My ass is starting to feel warm.  You know, I was just about normal for about 20 minutes.  You are.  You fucked it up. 
[02:04:30]  That fucking coffee has nothing to do with it.  I'm telling you.  My legs are shaking now.  Yeah, you are.  Because I never even had one Red Bull ever before.  No.  You're a chatty Cathy now.  All right, listen.  I got some cash today.  Come on, let's go.  I got one in my mouth.  Who wants this?  Oh, you want to bet?  English pines as well.  See, that's no shit.  You gave them fucking... 
[02:05:00]  This is drugging.  Now we're loading them up.  You got them all fucking...  Do you guys have headphones where I can't hear what you're guessing?  The times or something like that?  No, man, you got them all Barry Bonds up.  It doesn't count.  He's juiced.  He can't go two seconds.  It's not even fair.  What do you think?  I've got money.  You got money?  I got cash today.  I got cash.  I got...  Someone break a 20.  I'm in.  I'm in today.  What are you betting on?  How long can you go without the...  I'm not in today.  Five to five.  You can't even get...  You can't go. 
[02:05:30]  I'm in for one bet.  I'm with a fiver.  I'll go fast.  All right, I got five.  I'll go five bucks.  Oh, I'm going to go fast.  Oh, you got 20.  Here, give me a...  You're in?  Danny's in, too?  Danny's in, too, man.  Why are they in?  I'm in.  Let me look at him.  Let me see.  He's not prepared.  Look at him.  He's all fucking chugged up.  Frenchie's in.  I'll take a moment before we start to try to collect myself.  It doesn't matter.  All right, listen.  If you got the five, you're in.  If you don't, you're out.  I'm out.  I'll just...  I'll try to keep track of this.  I'll be the official judge to make it fair, even though I want in. 
[02:06:00]  It's tremendous.  All right, so who's in?  Gavin?  Yeah, I'm in.  I'm in, too, and so is Frenchie.  All right, Gavin.  Danny.  Frenchie.  And Anthony.  You in, Kev?  You in?  All right.  Nick Kev's in?  I'm not in at his fiasco.  He motherfuckers pumped him full of Ritaly.  I know.  He's all fucked up.  All right, we're...  Here's the deal, if you haven't heard this before.  Bwing!  We try to see how long Twitchell's can stay quiet before he has to bwing! 
[02:06:30]  Is it official bwing, is it?  Or just anything?  Anything.  Anything.  So, we got...  How are we going to choose now who goes first?  Because that's kind of important.  Ah.  And who goes last is pretty important.  Yeah.  My fucking heart's right.  Listen, you can make it like the...  Because you can make it like the price is right.  Yeah, I got it.  If you go ten, another guy can go eleven if he wants to.  You know what I'm saying?  But then someone else goes twelve.  That's why being first or last is kind of important. 
[02:07:00]  Maybe I have an idea.  All right.  Everyone write the time down and hand it in to me.  And if there's two guys at the same time, you split the pot.  Oh, wow.  A secret ballot.  You're a secret ballot.  All right.  Write it in.  How long have you been doing this?  That worked.  I've been doing this way too long.  See?  That's it.  You got a pen, please?  When we get fired next time, it's over, Johnny.  So we got five guys, and why do we only have $20 on the pot?  I took 15 out of 15.  My five's coming.  Oh, your five's coming?  There's only four guys.  All right.  We got five guys now.  He's getting spotted from... 
[02:07:30]  All right.  Everyone right there.  Right there.  He's going to boing his head right the fuck off, man.  Look at him.  All right.  I need a ballot.  I need a pen.  All right.  And he's like, I feel my heart racing too, because...  Everyone's handing in their ballots.  I need a ballot.  And you should have the medical field out there seeing a fence of Red Bull on a severe  to rich problem.  The medics are working on the ONA army that are coming back from the rally.  I mean, I drink a lot of coffee each day, but, you know, two Red Bulls and a coffee at  the same, within like 10 minutes, that's new to me. 
[02:08:00]  Frenchy, kiss your...  I got this with a...  Frenchy, kiss your $5 goodbye, by the way.  I need to be close.  What's he saying?  Frenchy's saying that.  Don't say it yet.  I won't say anything.  Let's see.  Did somebody bust ass, because that's going to definitely blow my concentration.  Big Cav is the last one.  Come on, Cav.  We got a radio show, dude.  We're not supposed to be able to...  I know.  Jesus.  Let's go to Big Ass Member for a second.  Bam, with an update.  Bam, what's up? 
[02:08:30]  We're out front of K-Rock Studios with 250 ONA fans chanting the way, holding up our signs,  just making a massive mess out of Howard's Rally.  All right, Bam.  Thank you so much, sir.  We're starting our jingle ball chance.  Huh?  We're starting our jingle ball chance.  What's it called?  Jingle ball.  Jingle ball.  Jingle ball.  The jingle ball chance.  The jingle ball chance, yes.  Howard's daughter having a little problem at the jingle ball a few years back.  Jingle ball.  Jingle ball. 
[02:09:00]  Jingle ball.  Jingle ball.  Did you see the picture of little Emily Stern?  No.  She's in some kind of a play, some Jewish play thing.  Yeah.  And she's playing some Madonna-type character, and she's pretty much half-naked in it.  And I hear there's more nudity toward the end of the show.  All right.  You're going to have to get some pictures of that.  Well, we're getting a lot of pictures up from what's going on today on opianthony.com.  Oh, there she is.  All right.  She's got hairy armpits, though.  Look.  All right.  Are we ready to do this? 
[02:09:30]  All right.  I've got to stand up.  Wow.  Here's the bet.  Okay.  The money's in the pot.  We've got $25 in the pot.  We're going to try to find, see how long Twitchell's could go without doing his points.  And this is whoever is closest.  Exactly.  And it doesn't matter if you go over or under.  Exactly.  It's whoever's closest.  All right.  Look at Club Soda.  Club Soda County wanted to meet you, Twitchell's.  That's Club Soda County.  Don't touch me.  Okay.  All right.  Sounds fair enough.  That bumped off at least five seconds.  Oh, my God.  I know.  I need to do both. 
[02:10:00]  He's making me nervous now.  He's making me nervous.  All right.  All right.  Here we go.  All right.  Here we go.  Here we go.  On my cue.  When it hits the 12 mark.  When it hits the 12, we're going to start.  We're going to start, so get it out of your system.  Four, three, two, one, go.  Fifteen seconds? 
[02:10:30]  That's a great...  Who had...  Did someone have 15 on the nose?  Officially, it's 15 seconds, which means our own...  No, he's losing his mind.  Who got it?  Danny.  Son of a bitch.  What did you have?  Thirteen?  Fuck, and I had 12.  Anthony had 12 seconds.  It was between Danny and Anthony.  Danny, the clear winner.  Gavin went with seven seconds.  The Big Kev went 38.  Are you insane?  I knew it was going to be around there.  Damn.  I was going to pick even lower, though. 
[02:11:00]  I wasn't going to go higher, so...  You guys want to do one more?  One more.  I'll go again.  I'll go again.  Who's in?  I better get...  All right.  Secret balance for...  I better get at least lunch out of this.  We've got to get a website for this, man.  Danny, you got some change so I can bet again?  Let me see what I got.  I've got change.  Just Vegas odds.  Vegas odds.  All right.  Someone break some 20s.  All right.  I've got 15 changes.  What is it? 
[02:11:30]  For a verbal thing?  It's any verbal thing that comes out of his mouth.  Yeah.  Is it my facial tics?  I can let them go?  Yeah.  Pardon me, Father.  I was holding my facial tics.  I'll see that again.  Can you still give them, like, blinking and stuff?  Yeah, you can blink and stuff.  This is the radio.  You want five?  Oh, good.  Good.  All right.  Who's in?  Big Kev?  I've got five.  I've got change.  All right.  All right.  We can make change.  All right.  Whoever's in, write their bed in their name.  Can we do a high stakes talk?  This is high stakes Tourette's. 
[02:12:00]  Damien Fahey's here from MTV.  High stakes Tourette's.  We've got to get Damien in here.  Hey, Tourette's.com.  High stakes.  What do I get out of this?  Do I get lunch or something?  The minimum bet is $250.  I'm coming to high stakes Tourette's.  There's only two Chinese guys and an Arab in this room.  The room like James Bond would play in.  Dude, can I rent you?  Excuse me.  Tourette, can I have my coffee not shaken?  Can you imagine renting him for a poker game? 
[02:12:30]  I was going through a toll booth the other day.  Shaken and stirred.  I was going through a toll booth the other day, and I knocked the change all over the place  going through the toll booth.  It just sucks when he gets this.  All right.  They're handing in their bets.  Damien Fahey, he wants in?  Oh, where's Damien?  Let's get Damien in here.  I saw him at the U2 show.  Damien, what's up, bro?  There he is.  It's a crazy day today, so come on in and just join the fun.  All right.  It's Damien Fahey from MTV. 
[02:13:00]  I saw you at the U2 show going in to the pit.  Oh, you did?  What an amazing show, huh?  God, that was ridiculous.  I've never seen a show that close.  Yeah, it was amazing.  I've been a U2 fan forever, and I've never seen him that close.  Like 10 feet away.  It was unbelievable.  You want in on this?  What is it?  Well, here's the deal.  High stakes, Terrence.  This is high stakes.  Yeah.  High stakes, baby.  I'm following the guy with Terrence.  He's got Terrence.  We got him jacked up on coffee and Red Bull.  Two Red Bulls and coffee. 
[02:13:30]  We're betting how long he can stand still and not, like, blurt something out.  What are we working with?  We've never had over 20...  21.  21 seconds.  22.  But he averages somewhere between 8 seconds and 15.  Right.  Somewhere around there.  22 is a...  That is a non-drug-induced...  Right.  Non-Turrence.  So this is drug-induced Tourette right here.  But also, remember, in the past, he's increased his time with every subsequent bet. 
[02:14:00]  So...  Oh, there's the odds makers right there.  Yeah.  Now, I'm thinking here a little bit.  Anthony the Greek.  Oh, Gavin.  You know, the Tourette guy, blurting out the names, it was because back in the old days,  they needed people to scare away burglars.  And they breed the Tourette guy to scare them away.  Well, I can't be a stopping guard.  Crossy guard.  Neat.  Wow.  That takes another couple of seconds off, doesn't it? 
[02:14:30]  All right, listen.  A nice bomb will take a couple of seconds off.  Yeah.  Oh, shit.  Oh, baby.  This is...  All right.  How many guys are in so far?  We only have four guys in?  Somebody pull his arm.  I want to...  Huh?  I think I want to be in.  All right.  You got to get in.  Five bucks.  Five bucks.  Five bucks to the state.  Five bucks and you just figure out how much time he'll last before he twitches or makes  his noises there.  And we're not doing Price is Right rules with the over and shit.  It's whoever's closest.  I don't have to hold in my headbanging of the... 
[02:15:00]  No, no, no.  That's right.  No.  Cool.  All right.  All right.  Patrice is in.  I'm going to go in, too.  All right.  Damien's in there from MTV.  What did you say?  What did you say, Patrice?  Not much faith.  Can't tell.  It's a secret ballot.  Secret ballot.  Yeah.  Give him a piece of paper.  You could split the...  If you have the same time as someone else, you could split the pot.  All right.  What are you doing here, by the way, Damien?  I don't even know.  I don't either.  Are we promoting anything?  New Year's.  MTV New Year's.  Oh, you're doing the New Year's?  Yes.  All right.  We'll get into that in a minute.  Someone's real close to my guest. 
[02:15:30]  I'm not going to say.  Again.  And Damien Fahey from...  Now, what if two people have the same guest?  Then you'll split the pot.  Yeah.  Okay, cool.  All right.  All right.  There's only...  There's two guys with the same guest.  Oh, I don't know.  I can't lose high stakes to Rich, baby.  I am the fucking...  I'm the guy.  We're in high stakes to Rich.  Andy from Minnesota.  Michael Jordan of Tourette's.  Andy.  Yo, I just want to know if I can learn how to play high stakes Tourette's on Bodog.net.  Bodog.net.  We're going to have to get in touch with Bodog.net and see if they can actually incorporate this 
[02:16:00]  on a website-based betting game.  We have to start a gambling website where it features this type of thing.  Yeah.  It's a live cam and you guess...  You have to bet.  We'd make a fortune.  And you got to have...  And all the shit that you talked about, like, okay, subsequently, it has gone up and down.  Right.  And the tendon...  He hurt his ankle last week.  This could be a factor.  Which could affect his...  Right.  ...the blood flow.  Because now he can't switch.  I feel my pulse, I don't really, like, I can't...  I'm not even touching myself and I can feel, like, my neck, like, you know... 
[02:16:30]  And any time you're trying to have personality passes Tourette's, it also goes up.  Oh, my God.  I cannot lose high stakes Tourette's, baby.  All right.  Here we go.  Here we go.  All right.  Listen.  By the way, the answer feedback going nuts.  Everyone's playing in their office right now.  They're all hanging around cubicles.  You should give people a chance.  Give another, like, six seconds for the office.  Yeah, the office bets.  Get your office bets in.  Get your office bets in, people. 
[02:17:00]  Get the office bets in.  High stakes Tourette.  Wait, we got Theo in New York.  Theo, what's up?  What's up?  Yeah, no, I got correct.  This show's fucking...  It's hysterical.  It's a funny thing I heard.  All right.  Thank you, Theo.  How's it going, guys?  We jacked our guy up, though, man.  He was too mellow when he came in here.  Oh, they gave him more coffee.  Stop drugging him up.  I came in here.  I felt so calm.  I was relaxing.  And then I just...  You need some cocaine.  This shit...  I'm telling you, this coffee... 
[02:17:30]  It's just fucking what I'm physically...  You're going to make them explode.  Yeah.  To be honest with you, I really do feel like eventually, like, soon, I'm going to have  to shit.  Because, you know, it's like...  Well, that's what happens.  Nothing joke.  Coffee and Red Bulls.  No, like, seriously.  So if I have to run out...  More personality.  Down a second.  I'm down another second.  I got the perfect time.  Just keep on talking.  I think you do now that I saw what your time was.  Damien's like, what the fuck did I get myself into?  This is great.  MTV's going to call me any second.  Get your ass out of that studio.  Get him out of there.  They're talking about shitting and they're abusing the handicapped. 
[02:18:00]  Get the fuck out of there.  We don't need the plug.  You work with MTV, right?  Yeah.  How long have you been there?  Three years.  So you weren't there in 2001?  I might have been lying.  What's your name?  Oh, here he goes.  I'm not a musician.  No, no, no.  Because I was...  What show do you do?  TRL.  I was on TRL for a while.  Can I have my paper back?  No!  I told you, you go.  Keep on talking, Damien.  Where is this going?  Where is this going?  I want to cut about eight seconds off of my guest.  He doesn't know.  He's on the scenic route to the point. 
[02:18:30]  He doesn't know about...  See, Louie thinks he's funnier than his Tourette's.  And he has a thing where he just refuses to be defeated by this boinging.  Right.  And he's trying to just kind of be cool with you.  And hey, how you doing?  He's KO'd by it every time.  It's boinging.  I accept the fact that I have him, Patrice.  And I am nervous right now.  But when I'm talking to someone, it kind of makes me feel...  Brings me back down early.  Screw me!  Hey, how's everybody in the family?  You know, it's like goat boy brewers. 
[02:19:00]  Yeah, yeah.  That's math.  How's things, man?  Everything's cool.  Things are going good.  Everything's cool.  Patrice, shut the fuck up.  Patrice, shut the fuck up!  How long have you got?  I'm at 30 seconds, you motherfucker.  Now, we're all going to be like Fonzie.  What Fonzie, Patrice?  Cool.  Like a bunch of Fonzie.  Correct the menu.  Shut the fuck up!  French is in, too.  Will, you want in?  This is a great pot, man.  Come on in, Will.  His books, 40, 50 books. 
[02:19:30]  Yeah, his pot's getting fed now.  Will left a great job with WYSP to join the O.P. and Anthony show and sell for the show.  He believes in us that much.  He lost a lot of money last year to build with us.  Will, you want in on this or what?  Five bucks.  Five bucks and you've got to give us a secret bet here.  How many seconds?  He can stay silent.  Give him a pen.  And I just got a report.  All the offices are ready.  Are they in?  They've got their bets filled.  All right.  Their bets filled.  And they're going much higher than us, a few of these places.  They're going $10, $20 a man right now. 
[02:20:00]  Office betting is in.  Office betting is in.  Will's got his bet in.  And it's any sound.  Just any sound.  Any sound that he utters.  All right.  We've got eight people in this.  All right.  Wow.  And only we've got two people with the same bet.  Damn.  You know what?  I think I've got somebody on the phone.  Oh, wait.  You've got to make a bet for somebody else?  I think somebody's going to bet you.  You're a fucking bookie for a Tourette's bet.  I feel so used.  It feels great. 
[02:20:30]  All right.  We're going to do this finally.  Okay.  What happened?  Cowhead, you're in?  High stakes sidebar for $20.  What are you going to do?  We're doing power.  High stakes sidebar for $20.  What does that mean?  I'll bet $20.  I don't have any change.  That's a one-off.  Oh, we've got change there.  All right.  There you go.  I'm in.  All right.  Cowhead change.  Give him a pen and a piece of paper so he can write his secret time.  I'm going to do a side game.  Yeah.  Oh, he's focusing.  That's what I'm talking about, man. 
[02:21:00]  We have like 20 people in the studio right now.  Damien Fahey from MTV.  He's doing the New Year's thing for MTV.  We'll get into that in a minute or two.  All right.  What's Cowhead's bet?  Oh, okay.  All right.  Cowhead has the same time as Patrice, so.  Oh, boy, Patrice.  I bet you're 50 bucks and shit's by 10, though.  Oh, God.  All right.  Are we ready?  All right.  I think we're ready.  I think we're ready.  I've got to see the clock here.  Oh, man.  All right.  We're going to start in 15 seconds, so get it all out there.  You started when the big hands on the 12? 
[02:21:30]  All right.  No.  We're going to go with the six, okay?  On the six.  Which is coming up here.  We've got like five seconds.  You've got to keep an eye on the seconds because it's got to be exact because we've got a lot  of close friends.  Oh, wait.  You fucked up.  All right.  Let's go to the nine, then.  All right.  We've got to go to the nine.  We've got like 10 seconds here.  Here we go.  We've got a lot of people calling in from the rally, too.  We'll get to those phone calls in a sec.  Pictures are up on opandanthony.com if you want to check out what's going on today.  Here we go.  And go.  Go.  Go.  Go.  Go.  Go.  Go.  Go.  Go. 
[02:22:00]  Go.  Go.  Go.  Go.  Go.  Go.  Go.  Go.  Go.  Go.  Go.  Go.  Go.  Go.  Go.  Go.  Go.  Go.  Go.  Go.  Go.  Go.  Go.  Go.  Go.  Go.  Go.  Go.  Oh, man.  Wow.  I'm already out.  Yeah.  This is a little record.  Yeah.  Oh.  Twenty-nine seconds. 
[02:22:30]  Yeah.  A new record.  What?  Motherfucker.  New record.  Twenty-nine seconds.  Holy shit.  Oh.  I've got to figure this out.  Twenty-nine seconds.  Twenty-nine seconds.  Whoever's got the highest, whoever's got the highest.  Before, you guys didn't say I could twitch and, like, get my, like, facial tics out.  Right.  Now you just said vocal, so it bought me some time.  Oh.  It broke.  It's so great.  Will.  Wow.  Will just won four.  He structures the whole betting concept.  Huh?  Without the twitching, it changes the whole schema. 
[02:23:00]  Well, now we've learned something new.  Now do we go, do we allow him to twitch or not?  We should get one more bet in.  Yes, he'll allow him to twitch.  He's got to, because the thing that breaks it is the sound.  It's the sound.  We're just now going to have to maybe pump the numbers up a little bit.  Oh.  Fuck now.  I'm going to go lower.  I don't have anything there.  I don't have anything there.  You're a crazy person.  Put this motherfucker out.  Put another nine.  All right.  Hold on.  First of all.  High state.  Patrice is getting into it now.  I'm not fucking around.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Listen. 
[02:23:30]  Will just won 45 bucks.  Woo!  Will's going to lose it right now.  Will said 19 seconds.  That was the closest.  I see Patrice's strategy and I'm working against it.  I'm in again and there ain't no fucking way.  What are we playing here right now?  What's the rules?  The rule is he makes a noise.  Any noise.  It's a noise.  Just breathing.  He was breathing heavy at one point, but that's not a noise.  It's got to be a something.  All right.  Now everyone's... 
[02:24:00]  Are we still doing $5 bets?  $5.  Yeah.  Another $5.  But it's Friday.  We should up the ante here.  What are the blinds going up here?  What the fucking...  I'm going to give you some Vegas strategy odds.  All right.  You got him way overconfident in his boinging.  See, but that's just...  It's like looking at a bunch of picture cards coming out in blackjack and going, hit me.  I know it's...  There's got to be low cards ready to come.  It's not a sure thing. 
[02:24:30]  This is a win.  This could change a fucking...  If the air conditioning hits him the wrong way, he's boinging.  Yeah.  He's holding his breath as well, which is hilarious.  That's right.  Do we have video of this?  Yeah.  Oh, we're getting video good.  I need a piece of paper and a pen.  See, he's been drugged as well.  See, all these things go against him.  You've been drugged.  You know...  Can I have something to read real quick that kind of mellow down for as much as I can?  Uh, no.  No. 
[02:25:00]  Nothing at all.  All right.  I don't have paper.  What do you got?  Okay.  Oh, I showed you my...  There we go.  That's all right.  I wasn't even near there, my friend.  No?  Okay.  All right.  The bets are coming in.  He did a world record.  I can't believe you.  That is a world record, man.  Has he ever gone that long?  Patrice.  No.  How you doing?  Good, man.  Good to see you.  How's your family?  Good.  Who the hell's Moose?  A cowhead friend, right?  Looking good, man.  Kmart.  Looking good. 
[02:25:30]  Oh, man.  There you go.  What?  Open.  Gavin's got his bed in.  Oh, God bless him.  God bless him.  All right.  Damien Fahey from MTV's got his bed in.  Hold on, man.  Look at Damien Gavlin.  You know, by God like me.  Uh...  Yeah, I'm gonna get there.  We might rethink this whole contract thing.  You know that problem that we had killed before?  Yeah.  You can't be doing this on fucking radio, Dan.  All right.  So what's he drinking right now?  Because that makes a big difference what's going on.  Coffee.  Coffee and Red Bull. 
[02:26:00]  Yeah, what have you had today?  Yeah, but it doesn't matter because you just went for 29 seconds.  How many Red Bulls?  I know, Joe.  I had two Red Bulls.  Two Red Bulls.  And a coffee.  Not to mention the coffee I got here I had before I got here.  Get into it now.  Oh, man.  There's no science behind this.  It's just complete freakishness.  There's no science.  Damien, when he first came here, Damien was like, oh, my God.  And now he's like going, yeah, you know, I think that she, the fact is it doesn't matter  about the Red Bull because he's getting scientific about it.  Yeah.  He's like, fuck that shit.  Well, you know, they've also said that nicotine, like I think I mentioned this before, 
[02:26:30]  sometimes calms it down.  Like kids with Tourette's, they've been giving him nicotine patches.  Get him a cigarette.  I can see him reading a lot of medical journals.  Get that man a cigarette.  Yeah.  Well, this morning I had several cigarettes.  I was feeling good this morning.  You know, I was really mellow.  And then, you know, I've never had Red Bull before.  It's really weird.  Yeah.  It gives you wings.  Someone just registered Tourette'sBets.com.  Oh, man.  Good luck to you.  Good luck to you. 
[02:27:00]  Oh, my God.  Jesus.  That is hilarious.  This is the funniest thing I've seen in my life.  So we got nine guys in?  Yeah.  Ten now.  Oh, we got ten?  Who's this?  Big Ten?  You're in?  No, that's old.  That's old.  Wow.  All right.  We got ten.  We got $50 in the pot.  This pot's getting bigger and bigger every time.  It's great.  And the good news is no duplicate bets in this round.  Oh.  $50 up for grabs.  Wow.  All right.  All right.  Are we ready?  All bets are in? 
[02:27:30]  All bets are in?  All bets are in.  Now, can I say something?  Can he have his eyes open when he's doing this for you?  He can do whatever he wants as long.  And no fucking noise in the snow.  No laughing.  The laughing would throw me off.  All right.  Who is baiting him?  Nothing.  Nothing.  All right.  That's fair.  That is fair enough.  You ready, Twitchels?  Yeah.  Yeah.  All right.  Let's do it on the nine.  On the nine.  Here we go.  And go.  And go.  The fucking guy.  The fucking guy. 
[02:28:00]  Oh, shit!  Twenty-seven.  That was a bing as well.  Twenty-seven. 
[02:28:30]  He's like a kilt spring in a...  I had fifteen!  His head was getting ready to pop off at fifteen!  Twenty-seven.  Who's closest?  Wow!  We have an expert in the room!  Will!  Will has made like a hundred bucks!  What did he say?  He said twenty-six!  Wow!  Beat somebody by one!  He said twenty-six!  And no one said twenty-eight, man!  And you're kidding, man!  He came and told me he lost his job and everything,  and this motherfucker's a Tourette's betting genius! 
[02:29:00]  This guy is...  He's got a system!  He's got a system!  And he's paying him off!  Hey!  He's paying the Twittles off!  Wait a minute!  Kick back!  Get a little kick back!  How much should he win?  How much should he win?  He, uh...  For the record, Patrice gave me twenty last time.  This bastard gave me five.  Is this...  Is this...  Is this three-car Tourette's?  No, he's just tipping the dealer.  He won the same thing.  He won the same thing.  Will has won ninety-five dollars.  A new advertising...  Kick a chip on the table.  Thank you. 
[02:29:30]  A new advertising slogan come in.  Coming in, uh...  Red Bull.  It gives you...  Yeah.  They oughta run with that one.  I would not be surprised.  I would not be surprised.  Oh, yeah!  Dang!  Oh, wow, that is...  Oh, my God.  I want to just do this all day.  It's the best.  That was grunt.  Can I get some more water?  Can I get some water?  Give this man some goddamn water.  All right, we're gonna regroup.  Maybe we'll have a couple more bets before we get out of here today.  Jesus.  He's up in the high twenties now.  Yeah. 
[02:30:00]  What did we adjust?  Like, what's the difference between what he was doing before?  He could twitch his face.  See, I went too high.  He went, what, 29 the bet before?  Yeah.  Then he went back down to 27.  I went up to 31 that last one.  But why was he getting 15s before?  Because last time, I thought I wasn't allowed to, like, twitch my face.  Oh, he was just...  I tried to shut down his entire motor system.  Exactly.  And today they said just vocals.  So I got to let loose some of the twitching.  And, you know, sometimes when I feel I need to do it or whatever, I can actually...  You can let it loose in a twitch.  That is...  That's brilliant information out of it. 
[02:30:30]  It really is.  That's all that's not fair.  He can do silent release twitching.  See, he can un-boying himself.  And you know what?  That started when I was a young kid.  I would realize...  When I was a young kid in class...  But now it's part of the equation that the better now has to use.  Well, when I was a young kid, guys, what I tried to do is when I had a certain  tick in class, like making noise, I would try to make it something physical.  Like slapping my knee or like twitching my legs or something.  That way, I wouldn't...  You know, I could substitute a fucking tick, you know?  Did you ever notice the kids in the back of the room trading money after you made it down? 
[02:31:00]  Like, could you imagine that?  What the fuck are they doing?  Like, their lunch money...  Please, ah!  Yell out a few bucks.  That was...  Yeah.  Freaking Will.  Yeah.  Will won $95.  I didn't even clean up.  He could release boing energy...  That's it.  ...in his body.  I blew that one.  I really thought he couldn't keep his fucking mouth shut.  No.  Alright, this is what's going to happen.  We're going to take a break.  Damien Fahey from MTV is here.  We're going to have the real thing that we were going to do today.  That's big...  Say hi to Damien Fahey from MTV on the mic. 
[02:31:30]  You think...  This is Gavin's favorite.  Big eyes.  I heard him outside, but I didn't see him, and I watched that lovely woman, and then  I turn around.  Um, hi.  Hi, Damien.  How are you doing?  Thank you.  Thank you.  I'm good.  Big A.  Big A.  Big A.  What do you got planned?  A lot of events going on for the weekend.  What do you got planned?  He's shaped like a road cone.  All right, that's Big A you're talking about. 
[02:32:00]  That's just funny.  Go ahead.  What do you got planned for the weekend?  Um, nothing planned yet.  No?  No.  You weren't.  I see.  This is what's going to happen, Damien.  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  And I think MTV should...  I can't wait.  I think MTV should steal this from us.  It's only a matter of time, by the way, until MTV...  Yeah.  These two are going to do the news for us today.  Oh, okay, okay.  They work great together.  It's unbelievable, actually.  Unbelievable.  Imagine Big A trying to do the countdown for New Year's Eve. 
[02:32:30]  It'd be like February.  Start them at Christmas.  There's no one left in Times Square by the time he gets to zero.  Yeah.  The cleaning trucks are out there.  And they try to time it.  They try to time it so Lewis right at zero goes...  Boing!  Boing!  Boing!  Happy New Year!  Boing!  Boing! 
[02:33:00]  You know what?  They told my parents when I was younger that one of the...  This was like years ago in the early 90s, that one of the things...  They don't know as much about threats as they did then.  They said shock therapy.  Whenever I do a tick, they could buzz me.  Or, I don't know, they or...  That would be good.  That sounds fun.  But, you know, I'd be fucking fine by now.  I mean, you know, that was the early 90s when they didn't know a lot about this.  And then they...  Can we tase you?  Yeah!  He's a fucking bastard, man.  All right, we gotta go to the phones real quick.  Would that be good? 
[02:33:30]  And he goes like...  Bring!  Boing!  Boing!  Who was winning?  Any winners in the offices?  Anything got there?  We're so busy, we haven't hit the NCP back in a minute.  We'll find out in a second.  Nice.  Find out what they did in Radioland there in the cubicles.  Hey, Paul, what's up?  Hey, we're fucking up Howard State so bad.  All the fans that crammed out in front of K-Rock Studios, we just destroyed their spot.  The police just moved them all out.  He can't even get out of his building right now because of us.  All right, hold your ground, Paul. 
[02:34:00]  Hold your ground.  No, no, no.  In the trenches there.  Huh?  He's screaming.  What, Paul?  There are 250 people in their signs right now.  All right, and where are you guys?  Because there's other pests in the area with their MIFIs.  We're Fifth Avenue and 56 right now.  Fifth.  All right, thank you, sir.  All right, see you later.  All right.  They're holding their own.  Damien, you picked a weird day to come in, I'm telling you.  Yeah, I really did, didn't I?  But you're doing the New Year's Eve party from Times Square for MTV, right? 
[02:34:30]  Yeah, it's going to be a good time.  Well, a lot of performances and stuff, so...  Are we allowed to go?  Are we allowed to go?  Are you guys allowed to go?  Absolutely.  No, I mean, not on the street.  No.  I've been on the street.  I want to be in the studio.  You guys want to be inside?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Well, we used to work for your company, though.  They might not want us to go.  Oh, that's right.  Yeah, that's right.  I forgot about that.  They have no problem.  That might be a really big problem.  We've done our show to promote, but when it comes to, hey, can you do us a little favor?  How about us?  No.  No.  What do you got, Ant? 
[02:35:00]  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Is taking the people and ONA fans are screaming, oh, talking to people.  ONA fans screaming in the background.  They're being yelled at by the staff to be quiet.  It's too effing funny.  I'm listening to Howard, and you can hear people yelling ONA, and Howard's building  is directly across the street from me.  I can hear the ONA army from my office.  Hilarious.  Oh, awesome.  Wow.  They're doing okay. 
[02:35:30]  I guess they're making an impact.  Bravo.  Our little, the little army that could.  That's right.  All right.  We're going to take a break.  Yeah.  Give us some more Red Bull.  Oh, fuck that.  Oh, fuck that.  Ugh.  Wow.  It tasted literally like a liquid sweetheart.  I did not like it at all.  Unbelievable.  Damien, you going to be around after the break?  Absolutely.  All right.  Damien Fahey from MTV is here promoting the New Year's thing.  We're going to take a break.  When we get back, it's Big A and Twitchell's doing the news. 
[02:36:00]  You thought the bang thing was great?  Yeah.  Holy shit.  Wait till you hear them read the news.  It's next.  I want to make sure Steve is safe this hunting season.  Oh.  I kind of hope they can get out of the studio before this thing starts.  Has there, uh...  Well...  Has there been a problem?  Well, they got a bear problem in New Jersey and Steve happens to live in New Jersey.  Where do you live?  Oh, Jersey.  I live in Jersey.  That's right. 
[02:36:30]  It's in Jersey.  Every once in a while they allow the hunters to just start shooting bears in the fine state  of New Jersey.  It doesn't matter where that bear may be.  Thin the herd?  It could be in your backyard.  They don't give a fuck.  As long as they thin the herd a little bit.  You're right, Bill.  They want to take about 400 bears out, I think.  Something like that.  And the animal rights people come up and they get all pissed off.  They sure don't want people killing the bears.  Uh...  And then the hunters want to hunt bears because it's fun for them.  And then the people that live in areas that have bears want them hunted  because you don't want your little puggle to get eaten. 
[02:37:00]  Of course.  At night when you put a little cute guy out back in the box.  Yeah.  Do we have audio of the hunters going out and shooting at the bears?  Oh, I don't want to hear that.  Oh!  This is audio of the bear hunt?  Good day. 
[02:37:30]  So, Big Bill, get the guy?  the guy. He sounds harrowing. He's supposed to have been very nerve-wracking. He's just  all in fast motion. You can't take that, Hunter. Oh, foul. What's Poe doing there? 
[02:38:00]  What's Poe doing there? 
[02:38:30]  Checking out the Opie and Anthony program on XM Satellite Radio. The ONA virus spreading  across America. We've got Damian Fahey from MTV in studio. He's like, what the fuck did  I walk in? Nice way to wake up. 
[02:39:00]  So what are we doing next? Is this the news? Yeah, the news. They're going to do the best  stories of the week and stuff like that. I would throw this on MTV tomorrow. Although  they don't need the help, obviously, but here comes Twitch. What's he been drinking? Patrice  and I went to the bathroom. We were both in the bathroom, and all you hear from is stalling.  I think he was boinging out some chunks, dude. Were you dumping, Gil? My fucking shit was 
[02:39:30]  twitching. Wow, we had one. It was bad. He was twitching and dumping at the same time, man.  All boys. I couldn't help it. I had to go. Were you going to hold it in if you leave  it more fucking awkward? Jesus Christ, did you break? When he's being sarcastic, his  was nice. Yeah. It sounds like why you. Why I oughta. Why I oughta. Why I oughta.  See this was Anthony that said it was the Motec. The Motec. Huw. 
[02:40:00]  grh. terr convictine from Three Stooges. What does that? He doesn't know, just . No, no,  they were comparing me in my tits to the Three Stooges. No.ян comments with  emotional  We got lots of photos online right now, opieandethity.com.  We got Ron coming into the studio from the Ron and Fez show.  Ron, hey!  What's up, Ron?  Just walking to work on 57th Street to see the pest out there, shutting down the front of K-Rock. 
[02:40:30]  So I pulled into the McDonald's just to watch them get pushed around by the cops from the other side.  It was like entertainment for everybody that was at McDonald's.  They're going, look at this kid getting chased.  It was insane.  Hey, it looks great, but why do they have got posters of opie and Voss?  That's what I don't understand.  Yeah, I know.  They're opie-voss posters.  Can we maybe update that a little bit?  It's insane.  What the fuck is Sirius paying for? 
[02:41:00]  If this was 92, he would have shut the city down.  Oh, yeah.  It is just so small compared to what it used to be.  Back with the book signing days.  Yes, man.  It was gigantic.  It was, yeah, the whole city would be shut down, police roadblocks everywhere.  It's just, it ain't like that anymore.  And now he's literally reading a speech.  There's all these papers.  Yeah.  Thank you to our advertisers.  And it's like...  I'd like to thank the Academy. 
[02:41:30]  It's like your wife made you go to an office party and you had to fucking sit through.  The old guy who's just going on and on.  And it's hideous.  Sorry, what's happening?  Wow.  I'm not up.  We have him so loaded up on Red Bull and coffee now that he's ready to explode.  He came in here too calm.  We couldn't have that.  He was standing behind me.  I thought he was going up my ass there for a second.  It was frightening.  You're not that lucky.  And Damien Fahey from MTV, Ron.  Good to see you, man. 
[02:42:00]  He does the TRL there.  Good to see you, bro.  He's doing the New Year's thing.  So there you have it.  I was listening to you guys today.  You had the winner of Apprentice on, Humpty Hump.  He was fucking amazing.  Humpty, dude.  From the old digital underground days.  Can I tell you something?  I was listening to Ron DeFez and you came up with that.  Yeah.  It was killing me that I couldn't take that and throw it on our show.  Hey, good, man.  He looks exactly like Humpty Hump.  And that's why I was silent when you asked if he was a good looking dude.  All I could think of was what Ron said and Fez said about him.  He looks like the Humpty Hump guy. 
[02:42:30]  It's perfect.  Yeah.  And I'm pissed off I didn't think of that one.  What a great heel turn, too, huh?  Yeah.  Suddenly it's like watching the WWE.  Yeah.  He just rips his fucking shirt off.  Yeah.  No, I'm NWO, you prick.  Fuck Trump.  It really had that turn.  Because Trump was going to hire the other one, too.  Yeah, he was going to take the champ who just watched $250,000 be ripped out of her  23-year-old hands.  Yeah.  Yeah.  So.  Unbelievable.  Ronnie, when's the Marine Corps' birthday? 
[02:43:00]  When is that?  It's coming soon.  You know something?  About 258 years.  Buy a cake and eat it.  Eat it, motherfucker.  You guys had me fucking roaring yesterday.  I was laughing my ass off.  I'm going to head back out and start a fire.  So we'll see what happens.  I hope it doesn't get you guys in any trouble.  But I thought maybe a fire would be the way to go.  You know, we are taking a big chance today after what happened last week.  You'd think we would learn.  Trust me, I'm down the block wearing shades. 
[02:43:30]  I got an umbrella up going.  I wonder if I'm doing mornings next week.  Let's see what happens.  That's the first time I've done a radio show with my fingers crossed the whole time.  Yeah, Ronnie's trying to do something to start some trouble.  I kind of like the morning gig.  I'm saying to Fez, do they have any sense of history whatsoever?  Idiots.  We are morons.  People don't realize how close we were to getting fired last week.  Sure.  And what do we do the first chance we get?  We unleash, I don't know, a ton of pests on this whole rally that's going on. 
[02:44:00]  Just asking for trouble.  What is it?  My buddy, Paulie, your intern, is his last day?  Yeah, well, technically he's already done, but he wanted to stop by and say goodbye.  Oh, he's not going to be working for you today?  No.  That's too bad.  I believe you guys can have him next semester if you want him now.  It's up to you.  That's okay.  That's okay.  I think he's learned enough about the business to go out into the world now and use his knowledge.  Right.  For the good of mankind. 
[02:44:30]  For the good of mankind.  What a complete dolt.  Yeah, he's the worst of the worst.  Just a dope.  And Earl losing his mind yesterday.  Earl had a meltdown.  Earl had a meltdown, finally.  All right, it's about time.  And it was a complete mutiny.  Like, everyone turned on Earl.  And I told him he's just got to rule with an iron fist.  You know the captains on the old sailing ships?  They took no shit.  If they told someone to swab the deck five times, the guy didn't go, hey, I just did it four times.  Or you're getting your ass lashed. 
[02:45:00]  That's how Earl's got to be.  Right.  Arr, just do your work, matey.  He wants to be everybody's friend.  That's his problem.  You can't be the boss and be everybody's friend.  Here he comes.  Unless you're Elo.  All right, Earl.  Here it is.  Earl, what have I listened yesterday?  What a meltdown of your staff.  They turned on you.  There will be retribution and things will be straightened out.  Oh.  At the christening, right?  At the christening?  Is that when all family business gets taken care of? 
[02:45:30]  There is a party tomorrow.  Oh, at the party.  All family business gets settled.  Arnold, hey, Earl, could you get me off the hook for old time's sake?  Yeah, you were fighting for your life out there.  You were saying that people's heads didn't seem to be into it yesterday.  And then everyone came back saying, fuck you, Earl, we're working hard.  And you weren't really able to come up with an example.  No, just they need a little focus to keep their heads on straight.  See, and Earl's from the school of even if things are going okay, 
[02:46:00]  he likes keeping them on their toes by saying, you guys aren't up to par.  You aren't where we could be.  And some people enjoy it, except for the people that are working under Earl.  They fucking hate it.  We look through that glass, and it just looks like a madhouse.  No matter what Fez and I are doing, we look over there to check on things.  All hand pneumonia.  It's going fucking crazy.  All hell breaks loose.  Yeah.  Every day.  What could possibly be happening?  You answer the phone, you type it up, it's done.  Right.  All right, Earl.  Jesus Christ.  All right, well, best of luck. 
[02:46:30]  I'll be listening later on after our program.  Of course we will.  Every day.  Ron and Fez right after us.  Continuing fucking soap opera with you guys.  All right.  All right.  Twitchels, you ready?  Where's Big A?  Big A, man.  All right, you guys got your news?  If that wasn't a Wookiee yell, I don't know what the fuck is.  Chewy.  You all right, Twitchels?  I'm never not all right. 
[02:47:00]  I'm always all right.  It just gets to me sometimes, but I'm fine.  I'm great.  I feel great.  I really feel excited right now.  It's really pumping me up.  He is awesome.  Awesome.  Of control.  You get must have been.  No, it's like a good feeling.  It's like a mix of, like, confusion and, like, you know, excitement.  This reminds me of the 80s where the Coke is all gone and we're looking for more and  this guy just, you know, or there's, like, one hit left on the pipe and he's like, 
[02:47:30]  could I just get a little bit of that?  Could I just get one more?  All right.  Who else wants in to check this out?  Anybody else want to come in?  Yeah, we'll get some people in.  Yeah, get some people in.  Everyone's welcome.  I think he's going to end up changing, like, learning how to incorporate the words with,  like, the boings with words.  Like, he almost did it.  Like, you know, it's just like, it's a lot of excitement.  You know?  Yeah, yeah.  This is wonderful type of shit.  Next time I'll remember to bring my other hand. 
[02:48:00]  Yeah, he's got to incorporate it in.  All right, here we go.  So we're going to do the news now with Big A and Twitchels.  He's jumping.  He's, like, banging his chest and the hand goes on the hips, then it's off the hip and  he jumps.  Is that water or coffee?  What does he have in?  Water.  All right.  All right.  Wow.  Okay, here's pretty much the weekend review as far as the news goes with Big A and Twitchels. 
[02:48:30]  Did we get a copy of the, I hear this.  Yeah, we got the copy.  Because I like reading, it was Big A. Big A has a problem with S-T words.  That's right.  So in their infinite wisdom, the people that write this up, and who is it this week?  Nathaniel?  Me, Danny, and Travis again.  Yeah.  Dan, Travis, and Danny write up the copy for these guys, and they put in ridiculous words.  S-T words.  S-T's for Big A.  All right, here we go.

[02:50:30]  Stick a soul.  Oh, wait.  We need flow.  You got to go.  Oh, my God.  He was just there.  He was just there.  I think this is an MTA story he's trying to do for the strike.  And was it necessary to put, and the president of the union, whose name is not Steve, they  just throw shit in now.  I think you're taunting him.  That's all right.  All right.  Let's go.

[03:06:30]  It's like a killed spring, isn't it?  Oh, Jesus.  And then the beginning, starting with our top story.  Stick with us as we stay on this story as the standoff continues.  You murderous fucking fucks.  I think Twitchell's done.  I was hoping we could do one more betting.  Nah, he's...  I think he's done, though.  He's wringed out. 
[03:07:00]  Too much coffee.  Yeah, he's on a down now.  He's in the turlet.  He's on a down.  Yeah, he's trying to mellow out now.  Oh, poor Twitchell.  Crashed.  He's going to come in one day and just not twitch.  He refuses to move.  Well, that's what happened earlier.  Well, I think we'll cure him.  We'll bring cured.  We'll bring back the 80s if we have to, to make him twitch.  I'll tell you right now.  I'm giving some coke.  I'm telling you, we'll bring back the 80s.  No problem.  I mean, he'd be amazing.  Really?  Meth. 
[03:07:30]  Crystal meth.  He'd be gone.  Patrice has a problem with this on some level.  I could see it.  I don't think he does.  You had a problem with us feeding him the red ball and the coffee, right?  I had a problem with the drugs.  You know why?  Because you're losing money.  That's why.  Well, once y'all get started betting, but you know what?  Lou, the difference between Lou and Big A, you just stay rooting for Big A.  Of course you do.  Because he's just a lump. 
[03:08:00]  He's just a fucking mess.  He's a nice guy as well.  He's just a nice guy.  Just fucking.  And when you're talking to him, he's just.  And you're both trying to pretend he's not doing the shit.  Like, oh, ba-ba-ba-dee-dee-dee-dee-boe.  Bye, dude.  Big A makes you start doing jazz.  I said, it's good.  Do-do-do-do.  All righty, righty, righty, Big A.  Bam.  Come on, Big A.  Spit the fucking word out.  But Lou fucking is so arrogant. 
[03:08:30]  You don't know.  He's such a little douchebag.  But he has that special disease.  But if he didn't, you'd want to throw him out the window.  Because he gets, you should have seen him get frustrated with Big A.  As if he's not a part of the bit.  Right.  As if to say, hey, I'm doing the news for real.  Big A is hard to win.  I'm the straight man, yeah.  So Big A's like, sth, sth.  He's like, come on, man.  Hurry the fuck up.  Yeah.  God, God.  Yeah, Big A, it's like you talk to him. 
[03:09:00]  And you want to say to him, I know what word you're trying to say.  Yeah.  We both know what it is.  Skip the fucking thing.  Uh, yeah, yeah, dude.  Are you leaving the bar soon?  Or are you going to sth?  I'm leaving.  Stay, I know.  Stay, no.  I'm not staying.  Don't even try.  Well, whatever he goes.  Are you leaving the bar soon?  Or are you, uh.  Go have another drink.  Hey, uh, let's get Big A in here, because I'm hearing that, uh, I'm hearing that he might 
[03:09:30]  lose his job.  Oh, we can't have that.  We can't have that.  Someone out there might have to get Big A a job.  Me too.  Big A, what's going on?  You might lose your job today?  Uh, nothing, uh, well, nothing definite, but, uh, one of the bosses is, uh, a little 
[03:10:00]  piss off of me, but he treats me like crap anyway, so.  But who wants that job?  Doesn't he, like, you have a job no one else would want.  He treats you like what?  Treats me like shit.  Like shit.  Crap shit.  All right.  Like, stool.  Like, stinking shit.  Wow, and what has he said to you that might lead you to believe that you might be fired? 
[03:10:30]  You're fired?  Actually, last week he even asked me, oh, he told me to fire you, but I didn't answer him.  Of course you didn't.  You tried.  They're not going to fire him.  This is a fucking taxi relationship with Louis De Palma.  Louis De Palma.  Fucking Locker thing.  It's, it's, it's, he's not going to fire.  You're fired!  I'll see you tomorrow at 10.  He's not going to get fucking fired.  I sure would like to stay, stay, stay.  It's actually, remain here. 
[03:11:00]  Yes, big A?  It's actually, I talk.  Yeah, you put his finger up, like, I want to speak, I love to, you know how this show works?  Like, everyone's talking, and the second you hear a gap where you know you can jump in,  you jump in, and we all kind of got that, we know what to do.  We step on each other sometimes, but for the most part, we know when we want to jump in.  Big A, there's not a chance in hell you're, you're finding that gap.  Big A holds up a sign, I want to speak now, and then, because everybody has to concentrate. 
[03:11:30]  Yeah.  And people wonder why it's just dead air.  You point to Big A, like, all right, go ahead, and, and you know, Big A has all the emotion  on his face that he needs to have, but he has the entire sentence emotion on his face.  Like, just like, hey, you getting fired?  And he, and he had the, yeah, that's fucked up face.  Yeah.  But he, but he had to finish the, yeah, that's fucked up sentence. 
[03:12:00]  So he comes in, he goes, his face is like, yeah, some bullshit, but he goes, yeah, let  me, tell you how, tell you how it's going down.  So by the time he finishes the, it's fucked up face, he already got the, ah, but I don't  give a shit face.  Yeah, like, I fucking know.  They ought to use the sensors on your face for the Kong movie.  That would have been perfect.  Just ask, all right, you're a fucking monkey, the blonde, you love her, no one wants you to  have her, here come the fucking fighter planes.  His eyebrows go down all sad, he just goes, they dub him, who, who, who, who. 
[03:12:30]  Oh, and Naomi Watson be like, what the fuck are you trying to say, Kong?  Nigga, just put me down.  You sure are, st, st, st, st, stunning.  Have confidence, Kong, have confidence.  Wait, Big A's got something, yeah?  I'm sorry, Big A.  Actually, I told one of the owners, I mean, he had no clue what I was even saying about 
[03:13:00]  it.  I told one of the owners, as I was booking out, I told him, you told him, you told him,  you told him, you told him, your mom's boxed.  Oh, all right, all right.  Just in, pretty much, uh, just in case.  The final words that people say on the show.  Just in case.  Do they know they have a celebrity work at home?  Do they know, do they know your prowess out in the streets?  Yeah.  Some people know about it, and other people don't.  All right, are we, uh, we should just find him a better job. 
[03:13:30]  Yeah, we gotta get you a better job.  How do people get a hold of you, Big A?  MySpace.  My, my, my, my, space, space.  Yeah, my, my, space, Big A, 614.  There was another Big A, yeah.  There's another Big A, yeah.  Holy shit.  Bastards.  Big A.  Big A, 614?  Yes.  Why'd you pick that number?  Uh, my birthday.  Aww.  I thought that was how long it took him to say stunning.  Six minutes and 14 seconds.  That was 17 minutes. 
[03:14:00]  Oh, my, big.  That's how many friends said, fuck this.  I don't even understand this motherfucker.  You drink the Red Bull, Big A?  Uh, I never tried it, no.  All right, next, uh, are you guys coming in Thursday?  Uh.  Because we're taking next Friday off, so, uh, next Thursday, I think these guys are coming  in to do the news again.  He's worried about his job, though.  Well, we'll find you a job, hopefully, before then.  He doesn't want to commit.  He's worried about his fucking job.  I want to, I want to find him a better job.  Driving a taxi in the Bronx.  We'll hire him.  Have him be a, a professional, fucking. 
[03:14:30]  Telemarketing.  Work the drive-thru at McDonald's.  Something fun.  Selling steaks.  Yeah.  All right.  Uh, Anthony, it's bowdog.net.  Oh, yeah.  You want to learn how to play poker, do you?  We should start a partnership with bowdog.net and do that Tourette's betting thing.  That Tourette's betting's great.  But, uh, see, if you wanted to learn about Tourette's betting, where do you go?  You come here to this program.  Right.  No one else is doing it right. 
[03:15:00]  Is anyone else even doing it?  I don't know.  I don't know.  You want to learn about poker?  Bowdog.net.  That's where you go to learn how to play the game of poker.  There are other online places.  You're going to go there and, uh, you're going to get raped.  That's it.  They're going to steal your money because you're not going to know how to play.  Bowdog's going to teach you what you need to know, uh, to play a poker.  You know how to bluff?  Uh, how to bet?  Tips on hand selection?  Things like that.  You might bluff in the completely wrong spot to bluff. 
[03:15:30]  You're playing your crappy seven-deuce-off suit.  Some guy's got pocket aces.  He's betting in a way that ought to tell you, this is not the place I should be bluffing.  And meanwhile, you don't know.  You just see it on TV.  Oh, I should bluff here.  No, you shouldn't.  I would still just bluff.  No.  Bowdog.net, idiots.  Oh, I'm sorry.  Get on there.  It's free.  It's fast.  Going to give you all the tools you need to make you a stronger poker player.  Bowdog, B-O-D-O-G dot net. 
[03:16:00]  Yes, indeed.  Yeah, you know what?  This, well, we got the Jimmy Stewart tech support call, which is pretty good considering  the stammering that we just heard.  Oh, God, throw this.  Keep your chin up.  I like this guy.  Yeah, let's play this.  And it's one of the guys from the Upright Citizens Brigade.  Well, look at Twizzles out there.  He's gone.  I'm following his rhythm.  This show is all about rhythm.  And when you have to follow that rhythm, it's tough to talk. 
[03:16:30]  Even the girl next to him is starting to switch a little bit as well.  It's contagious, I'm sure.  It's contagious.  You know, you've got to be thankful that you're born in this day and age.  If he was born, like, in the 1500s, he'll be in a 2020 special out of some fucking institution  with just Tourette's and Big A.  2020 in the 1500s?  In the what?  I was going for more medieval shit.  Like where they burn him as a fucking witch, Patrice. 
[03:17:00]  See, my brain is boinging.  My brain just went boing.  Huh?  1960.  Huh?  Sorry.  Huh?  I love that.  2020.  What about that bubonic plague?  We're going to be looking into it.  They couldn't burn him.  He'd shake the fire right up.  On the stage.  He keeps blowing out the match.  We don't have matches.  Burn ye twitchers.  Well, this is Matt Besser.  He was part of the Upright Citizens Brigade.  Right. 
[03:17:30]  And he used to get these calls to his apartment.  It was close.  His number was close to a tech support number.  So I guess he went a while just saying no wrong number.  And then decided to record him and have a little fun with the people.  All right.  Tech support.  Hi.  I'm trying to get on the Barnes and Noble line.  And I can't.  Oh, what's your problem?  The problem is that every time I try to dial it, it comes up that they can't get through and to call tech support.  Well, it's going to be more specific, but we're going to get through this. 
[03:18:00]  We're going to turn this thing around.  Great.  Do you use your toolbar?  Yeah.  I guess.  What's the toolbar?  Well, you've got to use your toolbar.  That's where your icons are that we're going to have to use to fix this problem.  But we're going to get through this.  The sun's on the horizon.  So we're going to turn this thing around.  Great.  Okay.  Put your disc in.  It's in?  Okay.  I'll boot up your computer. 
[03:18:30]  You have to restart your computer.  Um, okay.  I've got to go to shut down.  That's where your toolbar is.  You've got to grab all of it.  Okay.  Shut down.  Restart.  I'll grab all of your toolbar.  Okay.  I have that.  Now, do you want me to go to restart?  Okay.  You've got to stay focused now.  Don't get all upset.  No, I'm not.  All right.  Now, you've got to turn it off.  But then you're going to say restart.  Now, you check restart.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Okay.  You want me to press...  Okay.  I understand what you're saying. 
[03:19:00]  You want me to say press shut down or restart?  Restart.  Okay.  You've got to stay focused.  You're going to lose your cool.  Okay.  You're making me confused, though.  So I'm...  No.  Well, take a breath.  I'm taking a breath.  All right.  Just calm down.  Take a breath.  So I just...  I press restart.  Yeah.  Well, calm down now.  You can't yell at me here.  I'm not...  No, I'm not yelling at you.  Okay.  You know, it's frustrating.  What's happening? 
[03:19:30]  www.del.com came up on my screen.  So it'll be a minute or two now.  Okay.  Making all noises and what have you.  But I left the CD in there.  Is that good or should I take it out?  It'll say rum, right?  Yep.  I'll stick a music CD in there.  No.  I'm not joking.  No.  It'll break your computer.  Oh, no.  It's like throwing vinegar on a horse's ass.  Really? 
[03:20:00]  Well, that's a new expression on me.  I hadn't heard that one.  Excuse me?  I haven't heard that, throwing vinegar on a horse's ass before.  Oh, I'm trying.  You're going to get kicked in your head.  I guess so.  I don't spend much time around horses, so it wouldn't be something I know.  Oh, yeah.  If you don't spend time around horses, you don't make a jackass out of your own self.  Oh, well, that could be.  Yeah.  Where are you located now?  Houston.  Oh, Houston?  Okay, well.  Well, what?  Well, that's...  Where are you from? 
[03:20:30]  New York City.  That's right, a 2-1-2.  Right.  So, you know, we don't have a lot of horses to wrap them.  Yeah, but you've got a lot of jackasses up there.  Well, that's for sure.  That's for sure.  We're looking at 10 inches of snow on Saturday.  Oh, well, I say you don't look at the 10 inches.  You step out in there, you get out there, you work, you shove up that snow and turn things around.  Oh, you're right.  Okay, now, it came up here.  Yahoo Messenger cannot connect.  Yahoo! 
[03:21:00]  Hee-haw!  And now, another holiday reading from Charles Dickens' immortal classic, A Christmas Carol.  When Scrooge awoke, it was so dark that looking out of bed, he could see meddling carolers every bloody year.  Bah, humbug.  Ramon, fetch the nail gun.  All right. 
[03:21:30]  I want to thank Patrice O'Neill for hanging with us for the last two weeks.  Thank you.  You're going to have to come back in next week anyway.  You got to.  What, little Jimmy's going to be back? 
[03:22:00]  Yeah, but what the hell, man?  Yeah, I mean, you got to come in anyway.  We got a couple extra mics.  Uh-oh.  Eh.  I hear tell there might be a little cake in it for you, my friend.  I could see Jimmy, just his protective animal instinct.  Wouldn't it be great to have him, Patrice?  As I get all his fucking slimy snail juice all over me as he's going wacky.  I'd love for Jimmy to walk in and go, no, Jim, that mic over there.  Make him sit in the guest seat instead of in Patrice's seat.  Give him the stand-up, the big, the boing mic.  Yeah, the boing mic.  You use fucking bring mic. 
[03:22:30]  I got plugs today, I think.  Oh, Patrice O'Neill with plugs.  I'm actually going to be performing again.  Where?  Coming out of retirement.  Coming out of retirement January 12th, 13th, and the 15th.  No, 14th for me.  At Caroline's Comedy, eh?  Caroline's.  January 12th, 13th, and 15th at Caroline's here in New York.  Friday, Sunday, at Caroline's in New York on that day.  And then, what's that, Helium in Philly?  Yep.  January 25th through the 29th or something like that. 
[03:23:00]  You'll do some plugs.  We'll run on the show for the next couple of weeks.  Yeah, take in the recording studio.  Have your throw down like the ones Jimmy does that are so exciting.  Yeah.  Hello, this is Jimmy Norton.  I will be performing with Voss the Retard and Colin Quinn.  That one cracks me up.  I have a feeling you're going to do real well at Caroline's, man.  Oh, yeah.  You made an impression the last two weeks on these listeners.  Big time.  Twitchels, we shut up.  It's not about you.  And Twitchels may be opening.  Opening act.  He may be introducing, we'll have him introduce whoever the host is. 
[03:23:30]  MC the show.  Or Big A.  Maybe Big A.  That'll be your job.  How much you get driving a livery cab or what the fuck you do?  What's the average day of work?  Sometimes about $100.  I'll pay you $100.  You can bring up the host.  I'll get a few.  Okay.  It's got to be more draw.  I'll be there and I can't have Twitchels there.  So unless they bring, yeah, we'll write an intro and they'll be there to bring up.  I'll give them.  Yeah, we'll fix something out.  Nothing but bringing up the host of the fucking show.  Right. 
[03:24:00]  And then get the fuck off.  I'll have no Twitchels to be like, hey, I got something funnier than my twitching.  No, you don't.  Have a red bill, you fucking, you goddamn boat motor.  What is this with you thinking I'm trying to be funnier than my twitching?  I can't help who I am.  Oh, Jesus.  Oh, wow.  Hey, Club Soda, sidecar, Kenny, what's up?  No, I just noticed somebody in the studio and I just wanted to find out what his problem  was with me.  Frenchie?  Yeah. 
[03:24:30]  He has a problem with you?  Yeah.  Well, let's see.  What's the problem?  That's not the guy to have a problem with.  Oh, Jesus.  Kenny.  That's what I'm asking you.  How you doing?  Wait, what happened?  Uh-oh.  No, don't answer a question with a question.  Why not?  Come on, tough guy.  What's your problem with me?  I'm not a tough guy.  Oh, jeez, what the fuck's going on?  I didn't do anything, man.  Oh, no?  No?  You didn't complain about me after the whole Halloween party?  Uh, yes, actually, I did.  You almost knocked my fucking girlfriend over when you were walking by. 
[03:25:00]  Yeah, well, I can't, you know, help.  I'm so massive as opposed to a skeleton.  Yeah, but you don't have eyes.  I don't think you do have eyes and you don't see where you're going, right?  Well, maybe I was doing something.  Yeah, what happened, Frenchie?  Oh, man.  What happened?  No, I don't appreciate that.  That's all she was like to me saying, who the fuck is this guy?  What is he doing?  Why is he doing this?  But what happened?  How's he?  At the Halloween party we had.  We had a hardware cafe, yes.  Yeah.  And you were walking by, you know, he was following you. 
[03:25:30]  Okay.  And as he passed next to me, he shoves my girlfriend all the way to the right side.  He almost knocked her over.  So, what the hell is that all about?  It's probably the best touching she had in a while.  Oh.  I don't think so.  I don't think so.  Oh, boy.  Well, you know that.  I don't understand.  I mean, do you look where you're going?  I don't think so.  A fight's not going to be fair.  Maybe a bike race.  Nah, I know.  A Rome race. 
[03:26:00]  A cooking contest.  Maybe we can settle this with an eating contest or something.  I will fuck you up.  I have a club soda kidney.  Yes.  Change your name to wine.  Wine.  Splits a kidney.  Souffle baking at ten paces.  I will beat you.  Oh, man.  No, he tattletaled to Ben that he was insulted that I didn't let him backstage.  Look at Ben with his glove.  Look at the Instagram.  Good fucking Ben. 
[03:26:30]  He's over there laughing his ass off.  Oh, Ben loves it.  He didn't mention anything about the girlfriend.  He's just, like, embellishing now so he looks good on the radio.  And fucking Ben yesterday calls me up and puts one of his friends on the phone.  He's, like, feeding him shit when the other fucking guy is talking to me.  I have no idea what you're talking about.  I'm going to tell you what he was talking about.  I'm going to tell you exactly what the fuck he was talking about.  He was talking about.  That was classic.  French.  Classic.  I'm about to get fucked up.  I'm going to change this up.  I don't know the words he said, but he's, like, he started club soda Kenny and, like, 
[03:27:00]  and I know, and that cocksucker.  Right, Kenny?  We should all fuck up.  Oh, Bean.  Oh, Peek-Up-In.  Whatever he said, it was classic.  Let me change this up, Jack.  Whatever happens, just surrender anyone else.  Oh, fuck off fucking fucking shit, man.  Not talking to you.  Fucking fuck, sucker.  He's fighting anybody else to fuck with. 
[03:27:30]  Kimmy, isn't that fat nigga?  That asshole.  That English ninkin poop.  Yeah, fucking English.  English ninkin poop.  You limey, limey douchebag.  Oh, fucking inter-kitty.  That fuck ass.  Real just damn.  High side car.  Yeah, the only thing I got to say to him is if you've got a problem with me, with me,  you just tell me you don't have to tattletale to Ben.  Leave him out of it.  I didn't say anything about Ben, man.  I didn't say anything to Ben. 
[03:28:00]  Listen, you know, you're just going to double talk and try to get your way out of this, all  right?  I'm going to let you off the hook.  Oh.  Hey, that's nice.  That's very nice.  Hey, car.  We can all breathe in.  Absolutely, man.  Let him out, man.  But if you've got a problem with me, you can make it up with me.  That's all.  Don't be a little sissy tattletale.  But Kenny, what was he going to do?  Like, Kenny, do me a favor.  Don't bump into my girlfriend anymore.  And I'll give you a couple of bucks to pretend I pushed you. 
[03:28:30]  You're from Africa now as well, isn't it?  Can I change the name?  Yeah, yeah.  Well, let's see what French is.  African, French.  I'm every language.  You want the rock coat, man.  You want the rock coat?  The thing is, I don't have any way to reach you.  Oh, my God.  So, there you go.  All right.  All right.  Get the mics out of their hands.  Oh, crap.  Goddamn French.  We want to try to end it, Sean.  I'm fucking French.  English people hate French people.  Oh, shit. 
[03:29:00]  Well, here's what happened also with fucking Frenchie.  Yeah.  He plans his party every year.  He's got his little birthday party going.  So, everyone gets invited.  And some people are used to invite people.  Some people that, you know, hey, like my girlfriend gets called to invite certain people from the message board, things like that.  And then, last minute, it's off.  No party.  I got in a fight with my brother, and it's off.  It's like, we can't get in touch with everybody that was invited to this. 
[03:29:30]  And, no, it's on.  Regardless.  Fuck you.  It's on.  Whether you're at your own party or not.  And then, he gets in a fight with his brother, and they're both chefs, and it's in the kitchen.  And all I'm picturing is that Bugs Bunny cartoon.  I'll tweak your little pink tomato nose.  Alain Tuan.  Full of garlic everywhere.  With the two cartoon chefs just hitting each other with frying pans and shit.  Alain Tuan is mine.  Like yesterday, that's for sure.  Oh, God. 
[03:30:00]  I threw plates.  I threw, almost got a knife, and I wanted to knife him yesterday.  Yeah, a knife.  Take away.  You're going to kill me like your father?  You're a murderer like your father?  After you threw the plates off?  I threw, like, five or six plates.  I took some balls, pans, pots, whatever.  Whatever I could French.  Is he a chef?  You're a chef as well.  Yes, I am.  Oh, my God.  All right.  Very good one.  This is going nowhere.  Thanks, Frenchie, for wrecking the show once again.  Brunai in Colorado.  Hey, Opie, Anthony, thank you for taking my call. 
[03:30:30]  All right.  Patrice, listen, we heard that story yesterday, my wife and I, and I listened to it three times  on the replay, and, buddy, you've just taken it to the next level.  Your honesty and everything about that story was just so compelling.  Thank you very much for telling that, and, dude, you're just going to go to great places.  I appreciate it.  Well, it's going to be at Caroline's January 12th, 13th, and 15th.  We want a big show of support for Patrice at Caroline's.  All right?  Get out there.  If I wish I was back east, I'd be there in a second.  Thanks, guys. 
[03:31:00]  Have a great holiday.  Merry fucking Christmas.  Yeah, certainly.  Let's go to Chris in Florida.  Chris?  Oh, hey, man.  How are you guys doing?  Pretty good.  Good, man.  Crazy day.  All right, Patrice, you kick ass.  You're the best storyteller.  I can't even tell you.  That guy just said what I wanted to tell you, and at the same time, Patrice.  Patrice?  Yes, sir.  No, see, it wasn't.  He said it out.  Yeah.  I knew it.  You knew it was coming.  Good one.  You just knew.  You felt it.  Bobby in Georgia.  Hey, good morning, boys.  Good morning. 
[03:31:30]  Hey, listen.  I'm a pharmaceutical salesman traveling south Georgia, and I'm probably going to get fired  because I listen to you guys.  I plan my sales calls actually around the show and the replay in the afternoon, and hey,  if Big A wants to be a drug rep, he can have my job.  I heard there's a lot of pharmaceutical reps that listen to the show because they're on  the road all the time.  I've turned on guys to you.  My old man, he's in the medical business.  I have some colleagues that I've turned on to you guys, and we really enjoy the show.  And Twitchels, that whole deal is hilarious. 
[03:32:00]  What's funny about that is actually getting the visual of Patrice over there, just a big,  fat, jolly guy, just chuckling his ass off.  That's even more funny than listening to me.  You should see Gavin laughing.  Yeah, wait until you guys meet Gavin for the first time.  This kid's classic.  You got to take a picture of Gavin and put him up on the show.  Hell yeah.  Patrice, does it make you a little jealous, though, that you guys, like Norton and Bill  Burr, that you guys actually have to research your material, write it, where it doesn't  sound hacky or hokey?  And this guy could literally be telling a story about cancer on stage and then do one 
[03:32:30]  of his zings or whatever, and everybody just falls out.  God bless him.  It's a gimmick.  You know, it's a natural carrot top trunk.  All right, let's say hi to No Filter, Paul.  No Filter, Paul, what's up?  Hey, what's wrong, guys?  We just left the hard rock.  Stone was supposed to go in the front, but we fucked him up, and he had to go in the back.  So no one saw him go, and he didn't get to wave to his fucking P.O. fans. 
[03:33:00]  And now we're in a cab on the way back.  We fucked his whole day up.  Excellent, excellent.  Can't get in, huh?  Yeah, we tried.  Not at all.  They have scratch cards to see who can win to get in.  That was English.  You was up to help.  Oh, is that it?  All right.  Right on, man.  Great job by you and the rest of the P.E.S.T. today.  No problem.  We'll see you in a couple of minutes.  And they behave for the most part, so that's good.  Who are these guys?  Get a mic on there.  They're in here, so they want to say something.  Mafialife.com.  Mafialife.com.  What do you got?  What's going on, ONA? 
[03:33:30]  Hey.  I got some jackets I made up just for you guys.  Uh-oh.  And a whole bunch of T-shirts out there.  My voice is gone because I was just at the sickness out there.  Yeah.  They got the Million P.E.S.T. March shirts on.  Yes, sir.  Yes, sir.  Yeah, these guys are exhausted.  I shot some footage of what happened.  Everything was fine until my battery went dead just when Howard was on the bus.  All right.  I got everything.  I got some physical.  Yeah, I think it's fate.  But I got a lot of some physical violence that happened. 
[03:34:00]  Very little.  Not too bad.  But I got some stuff.  I'll cut it up, and I'll send it into Foundry.  All right.  Yeah, there's going to be a lot of video and pictures up on opandanthony.com as the weekend.  Could you send some raw footage?  Over to Steve so he can do it instead of having it compressed down to, like, three pixels.  No, you got it.  So we can actually see it and edit it and have a little fun with it.  You got it.  By the way, I need to apologize.  I'm the one who asked for a comment last night.  My name is John.  I apologize.  Oh, is that you?  That was me.  He goes, could I have a comment back on MySpace? 
[03:34:30]  People write, you know.  I read it and answer.  So he goes, could I have a comment?  And I wrote a whole long thing about how I'm not going to write a comment back to him.  I laughed so much.  I laughed so much.  He wouldn't comment, but he would reply.  He would apologize.  I talked to my fans and all my good friends on MySpace.  All right.  Brian in California.  Brian?  Hey, Owen.  You guys rock, man.  Hey, Patrice, listen, dude.  After listening to you yesterday, I got to make you an offer, bro.  I wanted to make you an honorary member of the KKK, brother.  Wow. 
[03:35:00]  You really turned him around.  You are breaking down barriers, my friend.  Breaking down wall.  Hey, I want you.  Patrice, man, bring your ass out to Reno and do a club out there, will you?  All right.  Thanks, Brian.  I've never seen someone cross over into that area.  You're really breaking down the barriers.  Another plug.  You know, I just want to really say thank you and let you know that the Mafia Life Army  was alongside with you guys.  I spammed about 2,500 emails to them.  MafiaLife.com. 
[03:35:30]  Thanks a lot, man.  All right.  Army's getting together, Anthony.  Thank you, gentlemen.  It's good when the families come together.  That's right.  A few families came together today.  All right, guys.  Thank you.  Yeah, we'll do something with that stuff.  And Lou just gave him his boing of approval.  Yeah, that's right.  Let's go to Ben's raw ass.  Ben's raw ass.  I want to play with Owen.  Okay.  Jay?  Taylor, and Red Bull gives you bing!  Bing!  Good job, Pests.  All right.  Yeah.  It wasn't bad at all.  Jay in Philly. 
[03:36:00]  Jay?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Hey, this must have put Patrice.  Yo, when you get down to Philly, we're going to hurt you down, man.  All right.  Thank you.  Because the whole gang of black ONA listeners, we're underground because we don't mess with  the puss like that.  Yeah.  Racist motherfucker.  I hear you.  A bunch of pieces of shit.  The damn black listeners of this show have to be underground.  We've got a goddamn underground railroad.  We've got to rise up, nigga.  Fuck that shit.  The first time a nigga just starts, it's going to be a problem. 
[03:36:30]  Yeah, don't fuck with the Philly dudes.  The big beards?  I understand.  Let's fuck somebody up, man.  I ain't messing with Philly.  Yeah, I ain't messing with the big beards, man.  Nope.  When you get down here.  All right, Jay.  Let me look at that, man.  All right.  The black listeners are underground.  Because they don't play that shit, man.  That's the, like, the...  That's hilarious.  I'm playing the Philly motherfuckers.  Nate in D.C.  What's up, Nate?  I just wanted to give you what I learned today.  Okay.  Learned that two Red Bulls and a cup of coffee just launched Tourette'sBets.com.  Yes.  Ramon, bring that man some cocaine. 
[03:37:00]  All right.  Let's go to Leo in New Jersey.  Leo.  Yo.  What's up, Leo?  Hey, what's up, guys?  Hey.  Oh, hey.  You rock.  Patrice, happy birthday.  I learned that you can get divorced at Kinkos if you don't have a lot of money.  Oh, yeah.  We did learn that.  All right.  Go Pes.  Be safe.  Yeah, I want to thank the Pes.  They did a great job today.  Bang-up job.  They took off from work, and they really, really made us proud today.  No filter Paul once in the studio.  Jesus. 
[03:37:30]  Didn't he say he was at the Hard Rock Cafe?  Uh, yeah.  Didn't you just call and say you were at the Hard Rock Cafe?  No, we were in the cab on the way back.  Oh.  I was just running.  I just want to mention a little odd thing that you guys probably find funny.  The chants at the front of the crowd, the Howard chants that was going.  The chants?  The chants.  They were pre-recorded.  What's the chants?  Chants.  Chants.  Chants.  What?  They were pre-recorded.  Frank out here was right in the front, and they were looking around, and the crowd  weren't doing anything.  It was all coming out of the speakers.  The Howard chants were pre-recorded.  Holy shit, are you kidding?  They probably pre-recorded from another event. 
[03:38:00]  Yep.  Wow.  It completely slipped my mind.  I knew you'd love that.  Are you swearing?  What?  You swear on that?  Yeah, definitely.  Hey, what's the matter?  Hold on, let me get my other guy.  You can scratch your little thing and get in the hard rock?  No, I didn't win.  It was a loser?  Yeah.  Well, shame, right?  Appropriate.  I only scratched probably 50 of these things, hoping I find one.  Wanted to get you in.  They handed out, I guess, passes.  One in 20.  Press pass, and then you had to scratch it off, and then they would let you in. 
[03:38:30]  Yep.  Bastards.  All right.  With their good thinking.  Bastards with a great idea.  Let's go to Shelly in Boston.  Shelly?  Yo, what's up, Owen?  Hey.  Hey.  I just want to say this.  You're looking good, Patrice.  Heavy D.  What a motherfucker.  Fucking fucker.  Carolina.  Carolina checking in.  Okay.  What was that?  Is he one of the five?  You're what?  He'll never say.  He'll never say. 
[03:39:00]  What's up, baby girl?  What's up, baby girl?  I changed every name to protect it.  That's it.  That's it.  His name was Montana.  Montana.  Southern state.  Fucking Nebraska.  What did I learn?  All right, Carolina.  I learned that Pepe Le Pew's a chicken.  And Kevin in New Rochelle.  Kevin.  Today I learned that Humpty Hump won The Apprentice.  Adios, Cyprous.  All right.  Oh, yeah.  Remember that? 
[03:39:30]  Adios, Cyprous.  Anyone need plugs?  We get all the plugs in.  We got Chris O'Neill.  He's January 12th, 13th, and 15th at Caroline's.  Twichel, you have a plug?  Yeah, actually, I have a...  I felt that from the car.  I don't know.  I'm sorry.  I actually have a comedy show in Philly as well at the Comedy Cabaret Saturday, January 7th.  And that's northeast Philadelphia.  You can go to comedycabaret.com. 
[03:40:00]  And you can still check out my website at laughterbylew.com.  All right.  Very good job today, Twichels.  We're going to be doing some betting in the near future.  Maybe next week we'll really up the betting, okay?  Club Soda Kenny.  I want to thank him for stopping by today.  Keith the Cop and everyone else that helped us out today.  Everyone that helped.  It was a crazy, crazy day and a lot of fun.  Thank you, tons.  Big A, I'd let you plug something, but quite frankly, I think we ran out of time.  You can try, though.  MySpace.  Wait, what?  Big A614. 
[03:40:30]  MySpace.  MySpace, Big A614.  614.  Big A614.  Become a friend of Big A.  Guys, this was a great week of radio.  We had a lot of fun, Patrice O'Neal.  Thank you.  We'll have you back very soon, obviously.  Jim Norton returns on Monday.  Have a great weekend.  Have a great weekend.  Have a great weekend.  Have a great weekend.  Just agree to protest.  You'll be in the Anthony show. </pre>
