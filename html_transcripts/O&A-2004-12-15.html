<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opened with Opie detailing a debilitating headache he attributed to severe constipation, leading to a humorous discussion of various remedies, including laxatives and even a past cocaine experience.  The hosts then discussed their upcoming trip to Las Vegas for the Adult Video News Awards and Consumer Electronics Show, debating the practicality of an XM Satellite Radio-provided tour bus for the cross-country journey, especially during winter. A caller mentioned a possible ear tumor linked to cell phone use, sparking brief discussion on cell phone radiation.  The show included a ski report and a "Whip-Em-Out Wednesday" promotion encouraging listeners to display "WOW" signs.  They then reacted to graphic news coverage of a car accident and a Queens fire, contrasting it with outrage over Janet Jackson's wardrobe malfunction, debating the appropriateness of showing violence versus nudity.  A caller recounted getting a possible suspension from his police job for yelling "The monster rain's coming!" on live television.  The segment also featured "Boathead Guy," a man who suffered a head injury seeking a date, with the hosts attempting to set him up via New York Confidential, facing legal hurdles. Another caller misidentified their gender, and several listeners offered bizarre suggestions to help "Boathead Guy," including one offering oral sex.  The hosts, along with Martini Steve (in flamboyant clothing and boots), speculated on the longevity of bands after member changes, focusing on KISS, Queen, and others. Tommy Chong and Gene Simmons were mentioned as guests. Martini Steve contributed a song parody about Gene Simmons.  An advertisement for XM satellite radio aired.  The broadcast also featured a "fuck you" segment of listener voicemails containing insults. A listener voicemail expressed anger at Opie for telling his three-year-old son that Santa Claus doesn't exist.  

The show continued with a discussion about the irreplaceability of band members, using Kiss and Lynyrd Skynyrd as examples, followed by a listener request to play the "shit dick" song, a vulgar piece naming celebrities.  Gene Simmons' motivational speaking tour and merchandise were discussed, along with clips from his lecture on self-esteem and unconventional views on marriage and finances.  The hosts prepared for an interview with three *Apprentice* contestants (Elizabeth, Ivana, and Stacey R.), with a producer warning about Stacey R.'s difficult personality.  A call about Donna Summer tickets led to a sexually suggestive exchange, culminating in the caller winning absurd prizes. The conversation turned to Anna Kournikova's marriage and the hosts’ perceived chances with her, Rachel Hunter (and her Playboy photos and role in a *Gilligan's Island* series), along with crude comments about Rachel Hunter’s physical attributes.  A detailed and explicit discussion of Chyna's sex tape followed, including graphic descriptions.

A later segment focused on celebrity sex tapes and Rachel Hunter's Playboy photos as a means of regaining fame.  The interview with the three *Apprentice* contestants (Elizabeth, Ivana, and Stacey R.) occurred, marked by frank discussion of their experiences, including behind-the-scenes drama and the firing of a contestant.  A humorous call insulting Jim Norton and a voicemail from his mother offering relationship advice were also included. This segment also contained an a cappella performance of "Riders on the Storm," numerous explicit comments and jokes about sex, and offensive language. The hosts discussed their own sex tapes and photos, and one recounted a bad experience with a limo service.

A segment focused on dating and relationships, with a caller detailing his dating strategy and unconventional sexual preferences, eliciting humorous reactions.  Gene Simmons joined the show along with the three *Apprentice* female contestants.  The discussion involved Simmons' views on marriage, relationships, and lifestyle, along with debate on male and female perspectives on relationships and sex, marked by provocative language.  The segment concluded with promotions for Simmons' DVD and the contestants' websites, interspersed with sexually explicit jokes.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  I made a noise. It went like, and they lost it.  They're screaming, what do you say? What do you say? What do you say?  I'm like, he says, that's what he said.  Which means I just blew snot on him and go tell my friends.  I'm just getting on my nerves.  And it ain't really the tellers.  I'm just doing my job, sir. I'm just doing my job.  Well, you're sucking at it, lady. I'll say that.  Well, I've been an amoco all night, and now I'm here working at the bank in my other job. 
[00:00:30]  I bounced a check for $3.  It charged me $30 for a $3 check.  Now, if I ain't got $3, I damn sure ain't got $33.  This just doesn't make a whole lot of sense to me.  I had a bank in Atlanta charge you $3 to check the balance in your savings account.  In other words, you walk in and go, how much money I got in this account?  Oh, $300. Well, $297. 
[00:01:00]  So what you're saying is if I ask you another 99 times how much money I got, I'll be broke before you go to lunch.  That's what you're saying.  It's a sorry world.  100 channels of crystal clear digital audio.  XM Satellite Radio.  Radio to the power of X.  The O.P. and Anthony Show.  XM 202.  The O.P. and Anthony Show. 
[00:01:30]  Come over to who.  THE O.P. and Lilian 247.  The O.P. and Anthony Show.  Thank you. 
[00:02:00]  Thank you. 
[00:02:30]  Thank you. 
[00:03:00]  Thank you. 
[00:03:30]  Thank you. 
[00:04:00]  Thank you. 
[00:04:30]  Thank you. 
[00:05:00]  We've learned our lesson, right?  Yeah, we have.  We've learned our lesson.  We're reckless, arrogant, stupid dicks.  I would like to have sent you an invitation to the pass party.  Get your cock out.  You know the Holocaust?  Uh-huh.  Picture the exact opposite of that.  Wow, that's really nice. 
[00:05:30]  That's just too good to be true for most people.  Do you realize who you hired?  Do you realize who you hired?  Beautiful girls follow you.  What kind of sick mind operates like that?  The O.B. and Anthony show.  Shit, piss, fuck, cunt, cocksucker, motherfucker, and tits.  Now we're going to do something extremely fun. 
[00:06:00]  Good morning.  Good morning.  Good morning.  I would like to just get to know you.  Well, my name's Opie.  Who is your daddy and what does he do?  Stop whining.  I'm not whining.  We lack discipline. 
[00:06:30]  You got a headache?  I have a really bad headache this morning.  It's not a tumor.  Thank God.  Well, I wonder about that.  I'm on the cell phone four hours a day.  I'm starting to think I might have a tumor.  Really?  I don't know what it is.  I got the worst headache.  If Ben doesn't have one, you couldn't have one with the cell phone.  You worried about that a little bit?  A little bit.  You know why I'm worried about the cell phone and the tumor thing? 
[00:07:00]  I think it was one of those old wise tales or whatever.  Yeah.  But when I'm on the computer at home and my cell phone's near the computer,  you hear what it does to the electronic equipment.  You hear it in here.  You hear it in here.  A lot of times people leave their cell phones on and they start ringing in here  and you hear the microphones go crazy.  Yeah, just before the cell phone rings next to my computer,  the whole computer, you hear it going.  Yeah.  You're like, oh, that's good.  That's got to be good for your ear.  Let's hold that up to your ear. 
[00:07:30]  Yeah, four hours a day.  So there might be something to this whole tumor thing if you use your cell phones too much.  Could be.  Could be.  But I have the worst headache.  The worst.  I was going to call in, I don't know what you call it.  Call in headache?  Call in headache.  I'm on Tylenol.  I got the Excedrin.  You said the Excedrin is a much better.  Excedrin is the better.  Tylenol does nothing for headaches.  Excedrin rocks.  That's the stuff.  I think I know what it is, though, and if you want me to get into it, I'll get into it. 
[00:08:00]  I heard part of your explanation earlier, and...  Well, you guys make fun of me because of what I...  It seems a little odd.  I've never heard of this.  I haven't really dumped in like two days again.  And it's piled up to your head?  Look, I mean, you won't know the difference, but I'm like bloated.  Oh.  And it's all crap inside me.  Jesus.  And I think what happens is if you don't like dump, it just keeps building up inside.  You're building up, building up, and it's toxic. 
[00:08:30]  And then your body's saying, look, man, you know, that's when you get the headache.  Like, look, you got a problem.  You got to take a dump.  Do you really think that's...  Yeah, without a doubt.  Because then like one good dump and the headache goes away instantly.  Instantly.  And it's all this stupid crap I eat in the morning.  The oatmeal, the...  Yeah, so what are you doing?  It's pasting you up.  Yeah, definitely.  I mean, definitely.  You know what you need?  I haven't used toilet paper in a month.  They come out so freaking clean. 
[00:09:00]  It's funny.  Oh, God.  You know what you need?  Hey, Drew, what's up, man?  You need a smoothie.  I'm thinking smoothie today.  Smoothie will clean you out.  It'll clean you right out.  I'm going to be in when it's smoothie time today.  I'm going for a smoothie today.  You just can't eat that.  I'm not kidding, man.  It's like all glue every morning.  It's all fiber.  It's all like high-protein cereals.  And I'm suffering, man, like you wouldn't believe.  And my head is just pounding. 
[00:09:30]  Have something that'll get that out.  Huh?  Have something that'll get that out of you.  Well...  Although I think that's a little more in your head than it is logical.  No, no, no, no.  You absolutely think...  Because your intestines are made for toxic, handling crap.  No, I understand that.  But if it stays in your body too long, I think it gets more and more toxic.  When was the last time?  We'll get a doctor on the phone maybe later, and I'm telling you, I think I'm on to something here.  When was the last time you had a...  A real?  A real one. 
[00:10:00]  Yeah, because, I mean, some will trickle out because it just has to.  Leaving a couple of milk duds in the bowl?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  A little bigger.  Little pocket rockets.  Oh!  Little pocket rockets going bloop, bloop, bloop.  Little lipstick.  But a serious, like, just...  It's been a while.  And I'm telling you.  I'm telling you, that's what's causing the headache.  Ugh.  I know my body.  So, bear with me today, man.  I mean, this headache is just killing me. 
[00:10:30]  You took the Excedrin.  It should be going away, yeah.  You think?  Any minute now.  All right.  This stuff's a miracle.  You know, I don't want to go down the road of the old, uh, the old enema again.  The old dirt road?  When we first started here at XM Satellite Radio...  Oh, that's right.  It was really bad because all our systems were messed up because we've never woke up at 4,  4.30 in the morning before.  It's ridiculous.  So, uh, when we first started, none of us were really crapping or eating right or any of  that crap.  It throws your system into a loop.  And I was forced to, uh, do the enema thing. 
[00:11:00]  And I don't want to go down that road again.  No way.  I'm thinking maybe laxative.  A suppository laxative?  No, those...  Who will put that in?  No, no, I'm...  No.  No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.  An oral laxative?  No.  Yeah.  No, I'm not doing, uh...  I'm not sticking anything else up my butt.  What's good for that?  What's good for the constipation?  Ew.  What a disgusting word.  I don't know.  But...  I'm a little back cup. 
[00:11:30]  You know what sucks about admitting this stuff on the air, though?  My email will be packed tonight.  As packed as your intestine.  Dude, go to White Castle.  Have a few sliders.  Home remedies.  Then drink some Schlitz beer.  No, dude, you gotta drink warm Meisterbrow.  Right.  I'll bring in all the emails tomorrow.  You'll see.  Because every time we talk about this, it's everyone's cures.  No, dude, my grandma had the best remedy.  Hey, all I know is those goddamn smoothies we drink here after the show gets started, 
[00:12:00]  about 8 o'clock or so.  Oof.  Just a soft, cushy...  Oh, dude.  I dream of that.  Cushy.  Oh, really?  I'm dreaming of that.  What did you bring to eat today?  I don't know.  The same crap?  Granola, I guess.  Don't eat that.  Oh, my God.  Granola.  I don't know.  That's what's doing it.  Oh, dude, I dream of a nice soft one.  That's what's doing it.  You're pretty much eating concrete.  These...  It's sacrete. 
[00:12:30]  Oh, you're right.  You're...  I'm not kidding about it.  You're eating gravel and then milk, which is like the liquid you put in the cement.  I used to go through a roll of toilet paper a week.  I'm on the same roll of toilet paper for a month.  See, that should tell you something.  I mean, there's...  You know, there's nothing on the paper when I'm like...  Yeah.  And then I look in the bowl and they're just bobbers.  They're just...  Rocks.  They're just like...  It's just disgusting.  That is really disgusting.  I'm sorry, but...  I am really disgusted. 
[00:13:00]  You know, it was either stay home or come in and tell you about my problems, which are,  you know, headaches and not dumping.  Never heard of the headache from that, though.  Let's go to Bob in Tennessee.  Hey, Bob, what's up?  Hey, how y'all doing this morning?  Pretty good, actually.  Good deal.  I was going to say, I'm a medical student, and what's happening is lower intestines are  actually trying to absorb all the nutrients they can, and since they're done, essentially, 
[00:13:30]  it's just absorbing toxins.  So he's right.  That is contributing to the headache.  I'm telling you.  I know my body.  If I don't dump on a regular basis, it builds up, and then I get these really bad headaches,  and then one good dump, and I'm telling you, it goes away instantly.  Oh, yeah.  It's because your body cleaned itself out.  There you go.  Why don't you send someone out for an oral laxative?  And then maybe by the end of the show... 
[00:14:00]  Dude.  You can take a dump.  It could be funny.  It could be funny.  The 9 o'clock hour could be just...  Yeah.  Could be me just dumping.  You can take it, and before you know it, you'll be in the tippy-tom suite over there  just getting rid of your problem.  All right, Bob.  Thank you.  Hey, no problem.  You all have a good day.  You too.  Let's go to Bob in Jersey.  Hey, Bob.  What's up?  Hey, how you doing?  I got the best remedy.  I got vitamin J.  You ever hear that?  What's vitamin J?  Vitamin Jim.  I don't get it. 
[00:14:30]  I don't get that joke, sir.  All right.  Let's go to...  Oh, he knew better.  Oh, he left in shame.  Mike in Idaho.  What's up, Mike?  He knew better.  Hey, you know, Bob.  There's stinks.  What?  Birds actually rocks the digestive.  And I'll tell you what.  You get your bowl of great nuts, you'll have about a three-minute window about ten minutes  later.  Yeah?  Great nuts.  I mean, you'll have a turtle head poking out.  You'll be ready to shit your life away.  Isn't that what you're kind of eating, though? 
[00:15:00]  Stuff like that?  I don't know.  Great nuts.  Trust me.  No, I'm going to have to search out a Jackson Hole burger today.  There's a burger joint.  Come on, guys.  Have a good one.  There's a burger joint.  I think we talked about this on the air.  There's a burger joint in Manhattan.  I'm telling you, you could get a burger any way you want.  There's like a hundred different versions.  That's all they sell.  The menu's up on the wall.  And it's like everything you would ever want on a burger.  And within, I'm not kidding, five minutes of eating that last bite, you are on the toilet.  You're gurgling. 
[00:15:30]  You're gurgling.  I mean, the burgers are delicious, but, man, they go right through you.  Your breakfast here looks like papier-mâché.  It does.  It looks like you've put paste and plaster and ripped up pieces of newspaper.  And that's pretty much what you're eating.  Oh, man.  I'll bring in the cereal that I've been eating lately.  I think this is what caused the problem.  Is it mueslix?  It might as well be.  It looks like little twigs. 
[00:16:00]  Who's eating mueslix?  It looks like little twigs and dirt bombs.  Awful name for a cereal.  Are you drinking enough water?  Maybe you might not be hydrated enough.  Yeah, I've been drinking a lot of water.  Let's give you a little chocula.  Let's go to Larry in Texas.  What's up, Larry?  Hey, good morning, bud.  Hey, Tom's not doing what's coming out of your ass.  Yeah, the true remedy is a glass of fiber a day, man.  You drink one glass of fiber every day, and you'll have a solid three-footer every day, man.  A solid three-footer.  Yeah, man.  All right.  Thank you. 
[00:16:30]  All right.  Now everyone is...  Look, I'll take care of the problem.  Now everyone's calling with their remedies.  Yeah.  I just want to acknowledge that I got the really bad headache today.  Jay in Connecticut, what's up?  What's going on, guys?  How you doing?  Good.  Yeah, I was just calling to let you know I had a tumor taken out of my ear.  Out of your ear?  Yeah, because of cell phones.  The doctor said the tumor that we just took out of your ear is from cell phone abuse?  Yep.  It's called acoustic neuroma.  How big do they get?  It was about the size of a pencil eraser. 
[00:17:00]  Oh, really?  Where was it?  Inside your ear?  It was behind the bone in my ear.  They had to cut it open.  It was about a four-hour operation.  Behind the bone in your ear?  Yep.  If you cut your ear back, they flop it over, cut the bone, and pull it out.  The bone in your rear?  Yep.  There's a bone.  Do you have a big bone in your rear?  Oh, yeah.  You want to hold it for me?  I love that old gang.  All right.  I just want to let you guys know there is something to that.  And he said it was from a cell phone? 
[00:17:30]  They believe it is, yeah.  There's research now.  I think so, too.  All the studies they do always come out inconclusive.  Well, you know, I didn't believe that crap until I started answering phone calls next  to my computer.  And just before the phone starts ringing, your computer goes nuts.  Yeah.  And you're like, what the hell is that?  If it's affecting the computer like that, what is it doing to the soft tissue around your  ear?  Tumor in it up.  I try to use one of those head things now where I'll hold it.  I won't even use my home phone. 
[00:18:00]  I'm starting to do speaker phone.  It's not a tumor.  Could be, Arnold.  I'm starting to do the speaker thing.  My vehicle is great.  It has a phone in it.  I press a button on the rear view mirror, and it goes, OnStar.  And then you say, call, number, please.  And then you just either say the number or you go home.  And then it dials up your house.  I have it set.  I go, Opie.  And then it dials Opie's phone.  And it's no headset or anything. 
[00:18:30]  So you drive around looking like a complete lunatic.  Because people will be looking over at me, and I'm just, ha, ha, ha.  Yeah, we got to talk about that.  And I'm laughing and talking, and I have no headset on.  Nothing in front of my mouth as far as anyone would think is a cell phone.  You just yap away to, you know, your sun visor.  Works pretty good, and I would think you're not getting the tool.  I mean, the OnStar thing, you got to think about what's, you know, being zapped into your car for that.  Yeah, but it's the antenna on your roof.  I mean, all this technology is great, but I don't think they ran it by the scientists before they decided to throw it in the vehicles. 
[00:19:00]  Yeah, but it's just, it's cell phone technology.  It's pretty much the same stuff, but you don't have it right against your ear.  You know, you're kind of, it's in your car.  The cell phone, it's a cell phone, but it's in your car somewhere.  Let's just be honest.  Everything causes cancer.  Oh, we know that.  Just everything.  Just think how many radio waves are going through you right now.  I know.  They're filling the air.  I know.  It's frightening.  That's why every night I put on my tinfoil hat, and I get into bed, and I shake with fright. 
[00:19:30]  Paul in Lindenhurst.  What's up, Paul?  How you doing, guys?  Pretty good.  I know why, in basic terms anyway, why your computer makes those noises when you have your phone next to it.  Okay, go ahead.  Well, I'm willing to bet you have a Nextel, right?  Okay.  No.  Anytime.  They all do it.  They all do it.  You use your Nextel.  I've never heard it with anything else besides Nextel, but I know that they work on a lower frequency range.  And it gets picked up by all the speakers in your car or on your computer. 
[00:20:00]  When I have my Nextel, I have it all the time.  There's an article about it.  I saw it a couple weeks ago on wildfans.com.  Oh, no.  Oh, no.  That's the first crash of the morning?  Please, everybody, steer clear of that wreck.  Please.  It's in the road.  We've put out flares.  We don't need anyone else piling into this guy.  All right, enough of that.  So, I got a headache, and I'm not dumping.  So, it'll all work its...  Oh, good.  Emergency crews are headed to the scene. 
[00:20:30]  We shouldn't have any more accidents.  Oh, good.  Was he hurt?  Was he hurt in that one?  All right, get rid of all the calls about me dumping, please.  Please.  Speaking of things we have to talk about...  The guy's calling doing an eight ball of coke.  Well, the old days, that certainly did work.  You would shit your brains out.  Was that the best laxative ever?  Oh, a nice coke dump. 
[00:21:00]  After that, you're grinding your teeth and dumping like...  Hey, man.  Like a nut.  I've got to take a drive into New York.  Do you want to take a trip with me?  Head is spinning around.  Let's just talk about stuff that means nothing for the next six hours.  Wonderful.  Shut up.  If you didn't have the blow, I wouldn't be listening to you right now.  Will you shut the fuck up and just give me a hit?  The saddest thing is running into people that are still doing it.  Yeah. 
[00:21:30]  You want to smack them in the head.  Let's make it a comeback with the kids, though.  Oh, good.  Make it a little bit of a comeback.  How the kids like the retro stuff.  But the guy that had the coke, man, he had the most interesting talk at the party.  Oh, yeah.  Actually, he was the most boring guy, but...  The blow.  The little brown vial with the spoon on the lid.  Nice.  All right.  Speaking of things we've got to talk about, Anthony, I guess we should just talk about  it openly on the show today. 
[00:22:00]  Elo called me yesterday.  Elo gave you a call?  That would be our own Eric Logan.  Well, they're very excited in Washington.  The subs for this radio show are just going through the roof.  Yes.  Just going through the roof.  And without giving out numbers, because God forbid we give out numbers of how many people  are actually listening to this program, I think the people, the critics out there,  would be very surprised at the numbers.  We're like, we have 20% more listeners than they expected, or 20% more subs than they 
[00:22:30]  expected by the end of this year.  Really?  We're way ahead of their projections.  Way ahead.  So they're very happy in Washington.  So everyone can slack off now, right?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Now we can just call it in for the next month or two.  We did our jobs.  We're going to Vegas?  Yeah.  For what?  The Porno Awards and Electronic...  What is the other thing?  The Consumer Electronics Show.  CES?  CES, which is the Consumer Electronics Show, and also the Porn Awards at the same time.  When are we going?  Because we don't even have flights yet. 
[00:23:00]  We don't have hotel rooms.  Club Soda Kenny's emailing everyone every day.  Freaking out.  We need to know.  Jim will only fly Continental, so that's a whole...  They know that.  That's fine.  That doesn't matter.  And that's fine.  I'm with Jim.  If Jim's going to do his research, which is the safest way to fly, then I'm with him.  I don't care.  You see the French trying to blame Continental for the crash of the Concorde.  Oh, they said a piece apparently flew off the...  That piece of one of the Continental jets fell off onto the runway, and then when the  Concorde ran it over, it flung it up into the wing in the gas tank and blew it up. 
[00:23:30]  So Continental's saying, uh-uh, we're not taking the rap for that one.  I do remember hearing that, too.  Actually, the day after it happened, it's a little disconcerting, isn't it, Jim, that  a Continental Airlines plane had a piece of...  Please.  Continental passengers got there fine.  I didn't say to X...  I didn't think of it that way.  That's kind of true.  If I say to XM, only book me on flights that take off right after Continental jets, then  maybe we're going to have a problem.  Leaving rubbish in its wake? 
[00:24:00]  Well, I think they're all kind of safe.  I only feel safe on that one.  That's the only one I'll fly.  It's the youngest fleet in the air, isn't it?  Well, I think JetBlue probably is low, yeah.  Continental probably is as far as the majors are concerned.  I love the JetBlue.  So JetBlue is the way to go.  Yeah, a lot of people like it.  They're not bad, though.  I think they're all like the Airbuses and stuff, so they're pretty safe.  Anyway, Airbuses, you mean like the one that took off from JFK and its tail broke off and  it crashed into Long Beach, I believe it was?  Was that American Airlines?  Somewhere down there?  Yeah. 
[00:24:30]  Right after September 11th, yeah.  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah, we needed that after September 11th here, a month after a plane crashes.  And it turns out the Airbus, well, the whole tail, you know.  And it decided to come off.  That's a little frightening.  I don't like those Airbus 300s.  I don't fly those.  That was because of winch here.  It was because the guy didn't take heed of the warnings that they had given him about  plowing the rudder over to one side a little too hard.  You know, the pilots, I don't know.  You should be able to do everything you want with those controls and not have the tail fly 
[00:25:00]  off of your plane.  So I'm a little leery of flying those.  Is Continental a little fly those, Jim?  Airbuses, no.  I believe they're all like Boeings.  Boeing.  737.  That's what I like.  I like your 767.  Ah, nice plane.  All wide body.  Yeah.  Kind of new.  Those things rock.  Hey, great.  So we're going to Vegas and we don't have any details yet.  And Elo called me yesterday.  All excited.  All very excited about how many subs we did because of the free play week.  I guess that was a huge success for the company. 
[00:25:30]  And we're encouraging them to give us another free play right after Christmas because a  lot of people are going to get XM Satellite Radios for Christmas.  It would be a great time to turn the show on to everybody again because people are going  to be just, you know, flipping around the dial like a lunatic.  It's a new technology.  They're not going to sit on the comedy channel or, you know, their favorite channel.  They're going to want to see what that puppy could do.  Right.  So we should be available for everybody and we could turn on a lot more people again.  So Elo has a suggestion.  I guess XM Satellite Radio might be purchasing a tour bus. 
[00:26:00]  Really?  Like some kind of tour bus that, like, you know, bands would use.  Uh-huh.  And his idea is to throw, like, six of us on the tour bus and send us off to Vegas.  And then we'd broadcast on the way, though.  We will die.  We would broadcast from, thank you, that's why I want to bring this up.  They would, we would, yeah, we would do our show from the truck stops and stuff.  Quickly. 
[00:26:30]  I can't sleep at home these days.  Right.  Well, I wake up and it's a chore to get the energy up to do a program every day because  my sleep habits stink.  I could not possibly imagine being, rolling in a bus, trying to eat right.  And that's me.  You?  No.  What kind of food are we going to get on the road?  That's the beauty of doing it, though.  It'll be just a cluster F.  Yeah, but can you imagine, like, there's six of us on the bus and five of us are fighting 
[00:27:00]  for a toilet?  Obviously, you wouldn't need one.  Oh, my God.  Right?  I wouldn't need one.  Oprah would be fine, but the rest of us would have to be listening to each other's dumps  at four in the morning.  You know what?  Especially Ben.  He'd probably shit from, like, you know, Pennsylvania all the way out to Vegas.  Yeah, but that'd be a nightmare.  You'd have to have your own room.  You, you're, you know.  Dude, it sleeps six comfortably is what he's saying.  Dude, you ever see the price of those beds?  Huh?  Those beds are tiny.  I know.  People fall out all the time.  And also in the winter. 
[00:27:30]  You end up like Gloria Estefan, all paralyzed.  In the winter, I'm not into going on a bus trip in the winter.  Over the Rocky Mountains.  Not happening.  In the summer, it'll be doable, like, certain little places.  All right, fine.  But in the winter, you want to go through Ohio and the rest of it?  Forget it.  We got to, maybe we could get the Rocky Mountains.  You know what that's like in the winter?  Not happening.  No, because I would never driven a bus through them, and I never will in the winter.  I didn't even think of that point.  Maybe we could get, we should get Elo on the line to get the details.  He might have this figured out. 
[00:28:00]  He's a genius.  Okay.  What, are we going to go through Brazil?  I was just going to say, yeah, well, then I'm all for it.  I don't know.  Let's pick up a little hemp.  We should find out what's going on with this trip.  Keep you warm on those cold nights.  A little hepatitis.  I'm not willing to just completely blow this off without getting more details.  Wow.  Because I think it would be such a cluster after it would make for some gray radio for the listeners.  We'd be miserable, but.  Look at Ben.  Oh, my God.  No, dude, come on.  Let's be realistic.  I can't think, besides like Obi said, it would be a cluster F, and I think that translating 
[00:28:30]  to radio might be good, but I really can't think of any good point of doing it.  I can think of a lot of bad ones.  The ones I didn't even think of.  Jim's saying it's the winter.  That alone is like, you know how cold it gets in the Midwest?  We're going to be leaving in like two weeks, I think.  Yeah.  It's already.  I know.  I understand.  I have family and friends in Colorado.  Do you know what it's like there already?  They've had the minus zero temperatures where you can't breathe. 
[00:29:00]  Oh, I don't know, man.  That's scary.  Fun for one day.  That's a scary proposition.  It'd be fun for one day.  In the summer, if they wanted to go to Nashville or something like that, I can handle a day,  whatever, that's fine, but over a two-day trip, I don't want to be miserable going into  Vegas, the greatest place on earth.  You're all cranky.  Well, we'll talk to Elo later and see if this makes sense or not.  I wonder if Elo would agree on going in the same conditions that we'd be in.  I don't know.  Seat six comfortably.  Sleep six comfortably. 
[00:29:30]  Where does six people?  Is it six bathrooms?  You think I want to walk right in that metal toilet seat?  The awful metal bus seat?  As you're banging around in the bathroom.  You think we want to follow you after you're in the bathroom?  No, you shouldn't.  I'm unfollowable in the bathroom.  That's what I'm thinking.  You're unfollowable in the elevator.  I couldn't imagine if you were actually dumping something out of that crap hole.  And then we're on the tour bus and you're farting the whole way to Vegas?  Oh, you bet I would be.  That's why I would make for some great radio. 
[00:30:00]  We would hate each other by the time we pulled into Vegas.  Could you picture Steve C. in one of those little beds?  Yeah.  With his little flaming shoes hanging off one end, his flaming hat hanging off the other.  Hey, Steve, do you mind if I smoke?  I don't care if my shirt burns.  He's in full flame wear today, too, man.  He's got everything he's wearing is on fire.  He's got the Kiss boots on, basically.  Oh, we were...  They're like two and a half, three inch heels. 
[00:30:30]  He gave us a demonstration of his boots this morning in the office.  Look at these boots.  Here's Martini Steve entering the studio.  Put that boot on the console here.  Look at this thing.  Look at that.  Look at how obnoxious that boot is.  You've got to get a picture of that for FoundryMusic.com.  Yeah, I will.  I will.  Yeah.  Burst into flame.  It's a great boot. 
[00:31:00]  I'm wholeheartedly against this bus idea.  I mean, I don't think you guys are...  Yeah, I mean, how are you going to drink martinis with the bus just swinging?  Shaking back and forth.  Oh, yeah.  They would shake them up real nice.  And who has to sleep in the bunk bed below Ben or something when he's herkying and jerking?  We did that bus tour, the WOW bus tour of New York.  We went out to Long Island.  I think we did Jersey.  And by the end of that, I was like, get me off of this thing. 
[00:31:30]  I could not imagine two days across the Midwest over the Rocky Mountains on a bus.  That's how Cliff Burton died.  That's how Cliff Burton from Metallica died.  They were in Europe and the bus tipped over after skidding on a sheet of ice.  There's no ice in the Rocky Mountains in the dead of winter.  Not at all.  It's almost three days, too, by the way.  L.A. and Vegas are five hours apart.  L.A. is a three-day drive.  So we're talking the long end of two days.  Is Elo insane?  And who's going to be sleeping at night wondering if the bus driver's awake? 
[00:32:00]  I know.  Absolutely not.  There's no way I'm doing that.  I'm one of those guys when you road trip, I can't sleep because you start fading out  and you think, oh, my God, he's sleeping, too.  And you wake up in those terrors.  Your leg straightens out real quick.  What the fuck?  Yeah, there are people that could just sleep the whole way on a road trip.  They have complete faith in the driver.  I'm the complete opposite.  I'm thinking if I'm sleeping, he's tired or she's tired and she's dozing as well.  It's also getting used to a whole lifestyle.  The bands, they get used to that. 
[00:32:30]  Just like we've been trying and had to get used to getting up early, it's another lifestyle change.  To try to do that, I would be, I'll just tell you, I'd be a wreck.  I would not be able to function day-to-day life, never mind doing a show.  I wouldn't be able to function.  However, I like the bus idea, but not for the winter for a three-day drive.  But I do like the idea of going out and doing some stuff on a bus.  For a day to go to Nashville or something?  Yeah, we travel and sleep in hotels.  Right, right.  And then broadcast, there's just no way I'm sleeping on a bus. 
[00:33:00]  Sleeping on a bus.  It's not happening.  Yeah, we drive, we broadcast, we stop at a nice hotel, go to bed in a hotel, get up,  back on the bus, break it up like that.  I like the way you specify a nice hotel.  Nice.  I want amenities, Elo.  Right.  I don't want a comfort in, my friend.  I need five-star.  They're very excited about this bus thing in Washington, so we'll have to talk to Eric  a little later in the show.  Well, maybe when Eric and Kevin Stradley hop on that bus, they take their little bus trip,  they can tell us how it was.  Fill us in.  Tell us how nice it sleeps six. 
[00:33:30]  All right, we'll see what happens with that, okay?  Thank you, Steve, and your crazy boots.  Love it.  At least, you know, because it's a very, very cold morning here in New York City.  It's in the mid-20s.  Yeah, right now it's 23 degrees.  So we thank Steve for coming in.  Ooh, that's so nice.  He just warmed up to the studio.  Yeah.  Just not roasting on an open steam.  Mark in Tennessee, what's up?  Hey, guys. 
[00:34:00]  I just think it's a sweet idea for y'all to do a bus tour.  Yeah.  And to kind of put your minds at ease a little bit about sleeping, the Government Department  of Transportation has a law that states you can only drive for 11 hours, and then you  have to stop for at least 10.  Unless you have two bus drivers with CDLs, you're going to have to be stopping every night.  Well, as you said that, I got so comforted, I began packing my bags. 
[00:34:30]  See, you know...  Jimmy, you're a great comedian, too, by the way, man.  Oh, thank you very much.  Thank you.  You don't get it.  I don't care if it's the safest driver in the world that they hire.  I will still have the paranoia when I start dozing off that he's dozing off, he's doing  blow, he decided to stay up for two or three days before the trip started.  Yeah, we don't know him from a hole in the wall.  Don't know him from...  Yeah, exactly.  There's that huge ravine somewhere where he doesn't quite make the turn.  The guardrail isn't built for a huge bus.  There we go.  Plummeting.  Or you might have that bus driver that's just overly confident in his driving skills, 
[00:35:00]  but you haven't driven with him for the last 10 years, so you'd think he's just a raving  lunatic.  Right.  You're looking out the window over the edge.  Right, like he's a foot from the edge.  We're getting awful close to that edge doing 80 miles an hour.  You don't know that the guy's done it a thousand times.  To you, you think it's a rookie and he's just seen what the bus could do.  Yep.  Well, Kenny has been emailing us.  I wish somebody could print out one of Kenny's emails that he sent about transportation to  and from.  He's so... 
[00:35:30]  Oh, yeah.  He's a psychopath, but he's good.  Jesus, he's on the money.  He's an organizer.  He's really bothering Washington, which is fine.  Yeah, he's trying to get things done.  He's borderline OCD.  We need a go-getter like Kenny.  Steve from San Francisco, what's up?  Oh, is he driving them nuts?  Oh, yeah.  Steve, what's up?  Good.  Oh, what's up?  Is this me?  Yeah, go ahead.  Man, it's actually Steno, man, from San Francisco.  All right, cool.  But I guess that sounds like Steve.  Hey, man, there's a panic going on because, you know, HIV is no longer the number one worry  out here. 
[00:36:00]  Right.  Wait, HIV is not the number one worry in San Francisco?  Are you guys insane?  No, man.  Oh, man, it's crazy, man.  It's the H-O-N-A-V going on here, man.  H-O-N-A?  That's pretty funny.  He's saying that the opium...  No, no, no, no.  Hey, it's not a laughing matter, man.  Folks get XM and it's fucking spreading, man, out of here.  All right, so the O-N-A virus is spreading in San Francisco.  Thank you, sir.  And the good news is you don't lose 30 pounds. 
[00:36:30]  Oh, man.  Here's what I didn't like.  I didn't like the way I acknowledged his joke and then he cut me off and goes, no, no,  man, it's no laughing matter.  I know.  He was so...  My finger was itching.  He almost hit the back of that earlier vehicle.  But it was nice to hear from San Francisco.  Yes.  Zero, what's up?  What's going on?  Hi.  You tell me.  Go.  I'm going through Idaho.  I just want to say I just signed up for two years there with y'all because I missed y'all  on that free play.  Oh, good, man.  You're not going to be disappointed.  Thank you. 
[00:37:00]  Oh.  I've got a solution for y'all for the road trip.  All right.  Go ahead.  If you get a peter belt made out of a bus, I'll get you there.  Yeah, I know.  Yes.  Thank you, sir.  See, these truckers are laughing at us.  They're like, what, a bunch of fags?  Yeah.  Yeah, they're like, dude, we freaking drive through blizzards.  Two days.  What are you worried about?  Yeah, yeah, faggots.  What are you worried about?  They're animals in the snow, too.  That's one thing I used to hate about doing road gigs.  You go out to, like, Lancaster.  It's like a two-and-a-half-hour ride.  And these psychos are doing 50 miles an hour in six inches of snow. 
[00:37:30]  They just don't give a shit.  I would never...  Oh, just plowing through.  Get out of my way.  They're fearless.  Yeah.  They know how to take the skid.  Oh, sure.  The truck is skidding, and they're like, pfft.  It's child's play.  And can you imagine all six of us on a bus running to a bathroom trying to fight for  the stall that has the hole in it?  I mean, come on.  Johnny, what's up, Johnny?  Morning, fellas.  Hey.  One of us on one side, Jim on the other.  I don't like the way I'm the go-to guy. 
[00:38:00]  Jimmy the mouth.  Johnny.  Morning.  Morning.  Morning.  Morning, Jimmy.  Hi, sir.  Let's go, Johnny.  All right.  Hey, you guys.  You guys got to get out of here, man.  You got a lot of misconceptions about how the road is.  Yeah.  So just get the fuck out of here.  Grab yourself a CD, CB, little fucking crystal meth, and you're good to go.  All right.  Thank you, Johnny.  You know what?  I think if it was spring or something, I would really encourage this and push this,  because I think it would be a lot of fun. 
[00:38:30]  I think it would be a good promotion.  I think we'd get some great radio out of it.  We'd be miserable, but it would be a lot of fun.  We would indeed be miserable.  So.  All right.  Well, did you see Kenny closer to Kenny's email?  No.  Oh, you got it?  Yeah.  About transportation?  Should I do this to you?  Let me take a look.  Yeah, I think you'd probably do a better Kenny than I do.  Yeah.  Well, Kenny is kind of our road guy.  He's kind of like almost our road manager, right, when we hit the road?  Because he's done it a long time.  He knows what he's doing.  He knows what he's doing.  He knows how to get the best rooms in hotels. 
[00:39:00]  He's just, he's all about details.  And he understands the travel details, too.  He doesn't just have to do security travel stuff.  Well, he toured with Dice for so many years that he knows what the deal is.  Yeah, they did everything.  He is amazing.  Regarding the Vegas Hotel, of course O&A get the most luxurious suites available.  And the rest of us get deluxe rooms with king beds. 
[00:39:30]  O&A should travel by limousine.  And the rest of the crew can get a van or a minibus.  Additionally, for O&A's comfort and convenience, three luxury rental vehicles, like maybe SUVs,  should be rented in Vegas and available at the hotel.  He's the best.  Is he really bugging them in Washington?  Oh, yeah.  He's talking about the airports every day.  I realize Newark might not be convenient for Anthony. 
[00:40:00]  He's right.  He wants us to charter a plane.  I wouldn't do that anyway.  I don't trust those.  Oh, charted planes?  He wants us to charter a plane.  Nice Gulf Stream would be rather lovely, though.  Ooh.  Nice plane.  Ooh.  That would be nice.  Yeah.  A little midget head.  A little Dick Ebersole job?  Yeah, you're right.  Although that was a skid off the runway.  That might have been that much.  They just probably didn't de-ice away.  I don't know if that was the chance fault that some of the awful pilot.  A little pilot error there.  Wait, wait, wait.  All right, well. 
[00:40:30]  So we'll figure out the Vegas thing.  When are we going to be in Vegas?  Because I think some listeners in the area will come by and say hi.  January 6th and 7th.  January 6th and 7th.  We'll broadcast a lot from Vegas.  And we're hanging in for those.  It's a Thursday, Friday.  Thursday, Friday.  Now, when do we leave?  We come the 5th.  Going out the 5th sometime.  6th, 7th we broadcast.  So we go out that Wednesday.  We broadcast Thursday and Friday.  But then are we hanging in Vegas for the weekend or something?  You better come back Sunday.  It's cheaper anyway.  It's Saturday.  We'll probably go to the porn awards while we're out there.  If we want. 
[00:41:00]  We could probably get it.  Sure.  Why not?  The funniest part about this whole thing was, remember last week when we had the meeting?  Funniest part, Ben?  Funniest stuff?  All right.  Hold on.  Hold on now.  Let me sit up straight for this as he pounds the wall.  Come on, Ben.  Yes, Ben.  All right?  Ope needs a good laugh and I need a good laugh.  No drinking coffee.  Make sure you're not eating.  Ope.  Let's all get ready for the funniest part, everybody.  Ope, you better clench your butt cheeks because you might just expel everything that's backing  you up from laughing so hard because from what Ben has said, this is funny.  Ladies and gentlemen, sit down and put on your laughing hats because here comes a home 
[00:41:30]  run.  Here comes the funniest part.  All right, Ben.  I can't believe I did that again.  No, we were talking about the porn awards the other day and how Jim and Steve know everything  about the awards.  So, no, it's not funny.  Awful. 
[00:42:00]  Can I say that that's not even the funniest part if the other option is birthday day around  the Ramsey household?  Now we're having fun.  Yeah, we sure are having fun.  Now we're going to do something extremely fun.  What's that, Arnold?  Oh, listen to Ben's funny story.  All right.  Wait.  It's funny how Jim and Steve knew so much about those porn awards.  Damn, that's pretty good.  It was.  That is a good one.  No, I know, dude.  I thought it was funny in the meeting.  I'm trying to think of how we can get like a 13 episode. 
[00:42:30]  That's a sitcom waiting to happen.  Jim and Steve know about porn.  Yeah, that should be your closing bit.  Yeah.  And you guys, you want to do Stan, ladies and gentlemen?  One more thing before I get off the stage.  Everybody else is there looking for Vegas, but me and Steve are like really excited about  the porn.  All kidding aside, ladies and gentlemen.  Hey, you know, I got to tell you.  You should never say on this show, the funniest part is, or I got something really funny. 
[00:43:00]  Never ever.  Funny story.  Yeah.  All right.  Thank you.  We should step in.  Unless you know there's something funny there at the end.  Well, that's a good thing to have happen after prefacing it that way.  If your story involves some sort of anal sex and then something unidentifiable on your  helmet, maybe there's tears, you know you got a gem, and you can safely say funny story.  Right.  All right.  We're going to take a break here.  I'm going to wash my apple.  I got to try to, you know what, so. 
[00:43:30]  Are you really?  I got to do something.  Why don't you have somebody, like Paul or somebody, Heimlich you?  Ooh.  That'll help.  Squeeze them like a tube of toothpaste.  Absolutely.  Yeah.  Squeeze those little, like old space food.  I want to play something in a break.  Any, uh, any requests today?  Any requests today?  Anything?  Anyone?  Bueller?  I don't know.  I don't know.  Can you replay Ben's story?  Ding fries are done?  Yeah! 
[00:44:00]  Actually, we could do, uh, we did have a request for that.  I hate playing this around this time of year, but people enjoy it.  What's that?  There's no Santa.  What?  Oh!  You want to set that up as I find it?  No.  That Opie, uh, up in, uh, Massachusetts, when we were up there, told, uh, told a little  kid there was no Santa Claus.  That's a good setup.  Close enough.  What the hell?  Here it is. 
[00:44:30]  Uh, yeah, I was just listening to your station a little while ago, and, uh, had my three-year-old  son with me, and, uh, you guys were putting down the Santa Claus thing, and, oh, it's just  your parents and all that.  Yeah.  And, uh, you know, I was, I, I like, I love Opie and Anthony, you know, and I am a faithful  listener, but, uh, I had to change the station.  Oh, that's okay.  You're doing parenting, that's called, when you change the station.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Wait, wait, wait, I, I detect that you're a little pissed at us, because we just said  that there's no Santa Claus on the air.  Well, it'd be one thing if it was, you know, a little later at night, and there wouldn't 
[00:45:00]  happen to have been someone's kid listening, you know?  Dude, I'd just save you, uh, the, uh, the hassle.  Now you could get the credit for all those presents you bought for him.  Did we traumatize him?  No, you didn't, actually.  He, I changed the station in time where he didn't pick up on it, because he was busy doing  something else.  Hey, what's your, uh, son's name?  It's Jeffrey.  Can I, uh, talk to him real fast?  Uh, why?  What are you going to say?  I just wanted to say hi to him.  You're not going to say anything bad, are you?  Oh, I wouldn't do that.  Yeah, are you sure? 
[00:45:30]  Yeah.  I hope not.  All right, where's Jeffrey?  I'll, I'll get him.  You don't, you don't really talk much on the phone, but.  What's your wife saying in the background?  Oh, she wasn't too happy about it when I told her.  She wasn't listening, but.  Oh, that.  Wait, wait.  All right, chill out.  Oh, I don't.  Okay, Jeffrey, somebody wants to talk to you on the phone, those guys we were listening to  on the radio?  I'm on the floor first.  He's, he's, he's got a measuring tape.  He said he's measuring the floor first.  And your wife is mad at me for, for doing that?  I, he said somebody. 
[00:46:00]  Oh, I better, I better talk to him and then smooth it over.  Okay, well, here, here he is, okay?  I'll give him the phone, but I don't know if he'll talk.  All right.  Okay, here he is.  Here, Jeffrey, listen.  Listen to this guy on the radio.  He wants to talk to you.  Here.  Jeffrey, take it.  Yeah.  Come here.  Come here.  Wait, let me get him on my lap.  Jeffrey, come here.  Come here.  Just listen to what this guy has to say to you.  Jeffrey, there's no Santa Claus.  Jeffrey, there's no Santa Claus.  It's your dad.  No.  Oh, no. 
[00:46:30]  Oh, no.  Heartless.  The very worst of the Opie and Anthony F.U. Life.  Fuck you to the stupid motherfucker, ignorant son of a bitch truck driver.  His truck starts on fire bad enough.  Fuck up traffic.  So what's he do?  He lets his load of fucking cattle loose on the fucking interstate. 
[00:47:00]  Three goddamn fucking hours because that motherfucker didn't want his cattle to fucking cook on the...  What a stupid son of a fucking bitch.  I ought to fucking throw him right back in the goddamn fire.  Fuck you, truck driver.  I'd like to give a big fuck you to my boss, Matt, and his fucking fiance, Jamie.  You guys can go fuck yourself.  Don't invite me to a wedding.  I don't give a shit, you fucking bastard. 
[00:47:30]  Fuck you.  Yeah, I'd like to send a big fuck you out to the guy who sent a fuck you out to Nick DiPaolo.  The reason why you've never heard of Nick DiPaolo is because you didn't have enough time to get your dick out of your sister long enough to fucking notice the world around you.  Fuck you, buddy.  Yeah, I'd like to send out a big F you to the PTC group that's trying to get the FCC to jump all over the television programs because they're too rinsy for their likings and stuff.  Hey, fuck you. 
[00:48:00]  And you people need to get a job.  And I hope the ONA army attacks your ass and your fucking chat board just like they did the Danza board.  I hope they make your chat board burn in hell.  Make Danza's board look like a walk in the park, you piece of shit.  Fuck you.  Yeah, I think fuck you out there to corporate fucking America and all you fucking stupid ass individuals out there.  They got to put all these fucking Christmas lights out there and run off all the fucking electric bills and make fucking corporate America richer. 
[00:48:30]  Whatever happened to a fucking Christmas tree and family.  Fuck you, all you idiots.  I want to leave a fuck you for Anthony and Norton for that Peterson Christmas.  That is a new low.  You have driven me now.  You have driven the show and me to a new low.  I got a 10-month-old kid and I still find myself laughing my ass off at every single goddamn Connor Peterson reference.  You're driving me crazy, but I love the show.

Hi, I'm John Davis, brought to you in part by The Canyons, Utah. 
[00:53:00]  Explore, experience, and discover the canyons.  Utah's largest single ski and snowboard resort, 3,500 skiable acres, 8 mountains, and 146 trails.  Visit thecanyons.com to find out more.  Western mountains in mid-season form, like at Vail, where over 4,000 acres already open.  Aspen in Colorado with 54 runs.  That's almost 80% of their terrain.  Jackson Hole in Wyoming is ready with 44 runs.  It's over half of their runs, as well.  Park City, Utah at 60 trails, including seven bowl areas. 
[00:53:30]  The cold and some snow continues for the west.  In New England, where Bretton Woods has some fresh snow in about two dozen runs.  Killington in Vermont, now up to almost 90 trails and 40-plus miles.  At Okemo now, 14 miles, including some top-to-bottom trails.  Whiteface in the Adirondacks, a little new snow for 16 runs.  Also into the southeast, where Sugar Mountain, North Carolina, they continue with five trails and 25% of the mountain.  I'm John Davis with the XM Radio Ski and Snowboard Report.  XM2 Hotel, the Opie and Anthony Show.  Go and save yourself, and take it out on me. 
[00:54:00]  Go and save yourself, and take it out on me.  Hey, it's Whip-Em-Out Wednesday on the Opie and Anthony Show.  Very easy concept.  You put a wow on your vehicle, and if the ladies feel like it, they'll see the wow,  and they'll flash you on the highways and the byways and the local streets and in your driveway and in the mall parking lot. 
[00:54:30]  It works pretty much everywhere.  Secret code.  We love the homemade wow signs.  We love when the truckers write wow in the back of their trucks in the dirt.  And we have the official Opie and Anthony Whip-Em-Out Wednesday bumper stickers.  You can get them through our website, opiananthony.com.  A couple ways to get them.  You can leave your address, and Washington will eventually give you a wow sticker.  Or you can send self-addressed stamped envelopes right to us here in New York City, 
[00:55:00]  and we'll send them out right away for you.  Right.  Right away.  And we say self-addressed stamped envelope because it just makes it that much easier and faster.  The interns open the mail, quickly stuff the envelopes, throw it right back into the mailbox, okay?  Same day.  Same day.  I forgot what the address is here.  I think it's 111 57th Street, New York, New York, something, something, something, something, area code, right?  I don't know what the zip code is.  All right.  Area code, zip code.  It's 111 West 57th Street, Suite 500, New York, New York, 10019. 
[00:55:30]  And that is up on opiananthony.com?  Mm-hmm.  All right, good.  I was just watching TV, Anthony, and first of all, they have the morning car crash, which we talk about every morning.  Morning wreck of the day of lovely sedan on its side in the left lane.  That's a fun one for rush hour.  Isn't that a fun one to come up on?  Can't you people stay, keep your cars on the road?  Traffic.  Well, it's the people coming home from the bars really, really late.  The true alcoholics that have to stay out to 4, 4.30 in the morning on a- 
[00:56:00]  How are you?  On a Tuesday night.  Where are you going until 4, 4.30 in the morning on a Tuesday night?  I was looking for a job.  Yeah.  I was going to work.  I don't think we'll ever hear from her again.  Her phone was turned off last week.  Her phone was turned off.  She's got no XM satellite radio.  Talking about Lady Di and one half of the retarded Laverne Shirley.  Her Lady F off and Di.  Really, really bad.  Yes.  So I was watching that, and then I was watching, there was a horrific fire in Queens here in  New York City, or a little east of here, and I guess the fire was really, really bad, 
[00:56:30]  and the footage they're showing on TV was just horrific.  Oh, it's great stuff that the news just loves.  It's got all the drama.  It's got the bodies being brought out of the building, all either dead or unconscious.  They're just showing this like it's nothing.  They're showing, I mean, it's freezing in New York today, and they show a guy that's just  laying in the middle of the road with just like, I don't know, shorts on.  Yeah. 
[00:57:00]  Nothing else.  Not moving.  He looks pretty burnt up, and he's just laying there.  And then they show other firemen, you know, pulling other bodies out of this fire.  Holding kids by like their leg, one leg and an arm as they're just trying to run out of  this building.  The kid's like got smoke all over his face.  And these people aren't moving.  You don't know if they're dead or alive.  You don't know if they're in shock.  I mean, I guess they've said so far only, they shouldn't say it that way, but one person  has died.  Well, they got Steve under control pretty early, but the smoke was what did it. 
[00:57:30]  But the point I want to make, we're watching this, and I'm just like horrified in a way.  Yeah, you look, and it's like, oh, it's disturbing.  They showed one kid, seemed to be early teens, I guess.  I was going to say like 12 even, 12, 13, short.  Younger than that, maybe, being brought out, and he just pissed himself.  And they show his pants are all wet right by his crotch, and that's what you show on  the news.  I'm thinking that's the one that's dead because, yeah, you kind of let go. 
[00:58:00]  You let go after you die, right?  Maybe he was unconscious.  You take a dump when you die.  Your bowels open up, so.  Yeah, I don't know.  But the point is, I just don't get it.  I mean, the news could show all that.  And let me make this perfectly clear.  I'm all for showing everything on TV.  Yeah.  Absolutely everything.  But if you're going to make some judgment calls, what I don't get is that they'll show  this type of thing on TV.  I mean, the news now shows dead bodies.  When we were growing up, they did not show dead bodies on TV whatsoever.  Unless it was a dead gook from the NOM opening. 
[00:58:30]  No, that's true.  They used to show the dead gooks in the NOM.  That's true.  But, you know, so they'll show all this horrific stuff, no problem, and no one has a problem  with it.  Hey, here it is.  There you go.  Look at that little kid.  It's disgusting.  Well, ABC News is showing it now, and they've shown this.  This is my third time seeing it.  They are loving this story because they have video of this happening.  And there's the kid that wet his pants.  Yeah.  That's great.  That kid looks dead, right?  We don't know who's dead and who's alive. 
[00:59:00]  They said there was one fatality, but they didn't say who it was.  It's a huge story here in New York.  And the point is, you know, they could show this on TV over and over again, but everyone  gets in outrage when Janet Jackson's boobs slips out for literally, what, a quarter of a second?  Yeah.  Half a second?  I would so much rather see boobs.  Of course.  Wouldn't it be great in the morning if we're sitting in our office, and all of a sudden  there's a nice set of titties on the screen.  You're going to go, wow, that's cool.  Everyone will smile.  You'll look and go, look at those boobies. 
[00:59:30]  How cute.  Instead of looking at the screen and going, ooh, you know, and getting that icky feeling  and, eee, you know, but for some reason, tits are a little more disturbing than dead people.  Than charred bodies coming out of a, being brought out of an apartment that's on fire.  I will never understand it.  Is it more disturbing?  Is it dangerous for kids to see a breast instead of seeing horrific images like that?  Wow.  Well, the news has, this is what makes me so sick about the news. 
[01:00:00]  They have carte blanche because they're news, and they shouldn't have carte blanche because  they're also built on ratings like every other television show.  It's an entertainment show.  Absolutely.  That's why they have a lead story.  Have you ever noticed they all do weather at the same time?  They all go to break at the same time, so you can't flip from news channel to news channel.  Right.  So they are built on ratings.  They're built on making money like a comedy, and yet they have carte blanche because it's the news.  It's disgusting.  But it is an entertainment show.  Absolutely.  And any of these jerk-offs that get into the business and think it's anything different 
[01:00:30]  than an entertainment show, what do you think the flashy graphics they have these days and  the attractive anchors, everything, all comes down to they just want people watching their  news programs longer.  Yeah.  That's it.  So...  Because you get higher ratings, which means more advertising dollars.  They sell ad time on it.  Absolutely.  Yeah.  It's no different than a sitcom or a CSI or anything else.  Except for the standards.  They're not held to any standards, or they're held to much looser standards because they're 
[01:01:00]  news.  Because it's news.  It just doesn't make sense.  It's annoying.  It's completely ridiculous.  This country is so effed up.  Our priorities in the country are really screwy.  Like, we think something is going to screw up our kids.  Like, seeing tits on TV is so bad.  And I'm not even saying it's, you know, it's a little bad.  As far as this country goes, it is so completely bad and awful. 
[01:01:30]  Yet, not one person has been able to tell me what is so bad about it and why it would  be awful for their little friggin' ick kid to see a titty on TV.  When, day after day, you tune in the news, and now the news is more graphic than ever.  More graphic than ever.  I mean, how far away are we from showing those beheadings on the news?  Eventually, someone's going to do it.  Once you break that ice, that's all it takes. 
[01:02:00]  And then, before you know it, the following scene is very graphic.  And you're going to see the beheadings.  It was disturbing enough seeing the footage right up to the beheading.  They were showing that.  They were showing people right up until the knife came out.  Which, once again, I think is much more disturbing than stupid Janet Jackson's boob.  God damn, I can't even watch that.  I think they should.  I've seen the beheadings.  You can't watch Janet Jackson's boob.  No, you beat me to that.  They should show them on the news every night, just so people know the animals we're dealing  with.  All you people that are protesting and saying that this is a peaceful religion, here you 
[01:02:30]  go.  Too disturbing for me.  Watch that.  It affects me on a level that I can't function.  It's awful.  I would see the beheading and just...  I've seen stills, and that's bad enough, but I've heard...  No, Jimmy has watched him.  I know he has.  He's watched the beheadings.  I know.  I don't even get a...  I don't get a morbid pleasure out of it.  It's disturbing on a really...  It violates you on a very weird level, a very primal level.  It's horrible.  It gets inside you, and you can't shake it, and I don't need that kind of shit in my life.  I could pretty much watch anything. 
[01:03:00]  But the beheadings?  No way.  And anyone who wants to...  I know where they are on the internet.  I just will not do the click.  And anyone that now wants to write or call and bash me for not looking at it, you gotta  see it to know what the...  Shut up, dick.  Beforehand.  You know, I'm calling him dick beforehand.  Because I know I've said that in the past, and people are like, you gotta see it.  You're not a real American if you don't watch it and understand what these people are about.  Believe me, I have a pretty good understanding of what these people are about.  When I was living here and smelling the dead bodies burning at Ground Zero, I got a pretty 
[01:03:30]  good impression of what's going on.  I don't have to watch the beheadings.  It's so awful.  You know, that smell will never leave me.  Oh, it didn't go away for a month.  We never got...  Well, I guess we talked about it a little bit, but...  Yeah.  I mean, yeah.  I mean, yeah.  The rising plume of smoke and death.  After the 9-11 thing, yeah.  I mean, we're what?  Two, three miles from Ground Zero up here?  And then I was actually still going out to Long Island, and yeah, all you smelled was plastic 
[01:04:00]  and burning flesh.  Yeah.  For days.  It was like dead smell.  And no one would acknowledge it.  You'd walk around Manhattan, and everyone knew, but you didn't want to really talk about  it, because everyone knew what it was.  Smell it!  You know?  Yeah.  Everyone knew what it was.  Disgusting.  But I don't have to watch those videos, because I'll walk around with an icky feeling, if I may  use the word icky, for a week. 
[01:04:30]  You know?  It's hard to shake that stuff.  It's so disturbing.  You lay in bed, because it's real, and the reaction is real, and you obviously can relate  to being in that position.  Because, yeah, you start thinking, and you put yourself in that situation.  Although, you know, if you're not going over there, realistically, the odds that it's  going to happen are pretty slim.  But you can still think, oh my god, what the hell is that guy going through when they're  sawing through his neck?  You know?  What's going through his mind right before? 
[01:05:00]  You know?  It's just too disturbing to even deal with.  The primal screaming, and I don't need to hear it.  Because it's not like it's a shot to the head, or even with some sort of a large weapon,  it's just a knife.  Yeah.  And there's one or two guys holding the head back.  Animals.  They really are.  They're just savages.  They do it to each other, though, too.  So it's not just, you know, imperialist awful Americans.  Taliban, when they used to go out to the soccer field at the halftime, and they would hold  these people down and just chop a head off, or a leg. 
[01:05:30]  Sometimes they'd just maim you.  You know?  They're animals, and they deserve to be wiped off the face of the earth.  Don't get me wrong.  But what we were talking about, how we got into this, I do believe the news is very close  to showing stuff like that.  Like Ope said, years ago, you never saw dead bodies.  They would never show them.  Now, they pop them on the news all the time.  And that, a lot more disturbing than any kind of news.  All those kind of sexual content.  All those autopsy shows now show the corpses and everything.  Yeah.  So, Brian, the trucker.  What's up, Brian? 
[01:06:00]  Yeah, I mean, you go to watch Discovery Channel or National Geographic, and you can watch  take any tries.  The black woman's tits hanging out.  Kids can watch it.  But you can't see a tit on TV.  Yeah.  But those aren't tits, though, man.  They're just...  Yeah.  Oh, they're ravaged by 12.  Yeah, they're...  Yeah.  Feeding a baby off of one and a hyena off the other kind of takes its toll on the nips, 
[01:06:30]  you know?  I'd just like to say, I used to listen to you guys when you guys were in Ohio and syndicated.  Yeah.  And I stumbled across the free play, and then I signed up because I used to listen  to you guys all the time.  Oh, cool.  Thanks.  You stumbled across the free play.  Did you know we were on XM?  No, I didn't.  Yeah, that's the problem.  We've been yelling and screaming to Washington about that.  We're saying, look, our old listeners still don't know we're on XM Satellite Radio.  He had XM, and he didn't know it.  You've got to tell them, because there's a lot of people that will definitely buy XM Satellite  Radio when they find out. 
[01:07:00]  All right.  Can I get one more quick second?  Yeah, go ahead, Brian.  I listened last week, and you guys were doing t-shirt things.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  Yeah.  Well, Lacey Peterson must have been on a date with Tony Danza's mule, and that's why Scott  Peterson murdered her.  He found out.  He needs a new trial.  All right.  Steven in San Francisco.  Whenever someone says, can I say one more thing? 
[01:07:30]  Yeah, don't.  That's another bad one on this show.  Wait, one more thing.  One more thing.  Silence from the group.  It's actually Steven from San Francisco.  Let me say that, you know, it's fucked up when a fucking shit big city can cut off fucking  genius, like, you know, like Jimmy Norton.  Oh, thank you, fella.  Oh, you're from earlier.  Man, yeah, I'm so sorry, man.  I cut you off.  You really got to stop calling.  You were fine, dude.  You really got to stop calling.  Just enjoy the show. 
[01:08:00]  Stop calling.  Jimmy, I love you, baby.  And I love you, too, sweetie.  Jimmy.  Not going to work, mister.  All right.  Let's go to...  Even with all of our love mutually.  Hey, you guys remember Boathead Guy?  Yes.  Oh, who could forget?  He's on the phone.  Jim, what's up?  How are you?  What's up, Jim?  Jim, well, we got a lot of new listeners since we last talked to Jim.  We certainly do.  Jim at the age of 17, I think?  No, 15.  He was 15.  I'm sorry.  Took a boat to the head.  Major head wound. 
[01:08:30]  Out on a little boat with his neighbor, I guess.  And another boat came up behind and hit you?  Yes.  And hit him right in the back of the head with the bow of the boat.  How do you get hit in the head with a boat?  At least have the dignity to be taped and thrown off in the ocean.  It was my luck, I guess.  It was your luck.  And now how old are you?  I'm 31.  31, so like 16 years ago.  And all he wants is to get laid. 
[01:09:00]  He wants to get laid.  And his birthday is Friday?  Yes.  Nice to know even a boat to the head doesn't stop that urge, you know?  Whatever happened with New York Confidential?  I thought we were going to introduce them to...  I don't know where we're at with that.  Lawyers?  Well, lawyers what?  What lawyers?  Don't hide.  Tell us what's going on.  Funny lawyer story.  We're trying to get this guy laid.  We got a company that we'll definitely take care of, Jim.  What do the lawyers have to do with anything?  We can introduce...  We can make an introduction between people?  Don't, don't.  Same lawyer Drew Bledsoe needed when he had to get off that contract. 
[01:09:30]  Oh, don't, don't.  Yeah, I was out there when he was partying with Tom Brady and he was saying,  I got to wear the Super Bowl ring, dude.  That is true, though.  I did get to wear the Super Bowl ring.  Get down, put the ring on us.  Psychotamics.  Relax over there, Earl.  So, what's the problem with the lawyers?  What are they...  I don't know.  Why would you listen to them?  Yeah.  For what?  Yeah, what's going on?  Just tell us.  I don't know how they were worried about something legal with him. 
[01:10:00]  How about this?  Here's the legal part.  We introduce...  We're going to make an introduction between a young lady.  At New York Confidential, there's no money exchanged and this guy for a dinner date.  That's what we're going to make an introduction.  Have you ever had a dinner date with a beautiful chick?  No.  No need to answer.  Of course you haven't.  You took a boat to the skull.  So, we're going to introduce you and have a nice dinner date with a hot chick.  What lawyer can say that's wrong?  And if she happens to feel sorry for him and knows, like, the anchor's mark on the side  of his head and wants to give him a hummer, that's her prerogative. 
[01:10:30]  It's just like any other night out.  That's what the lawyers have to do.  The lawyers have nothing to say.  Yeah, Jim, we never asked you.  What does your head look like these days?  It's fine.  Do you have a big, ugly scar or anything?  No, I have my hair.  My hair grew in.  No dent or anything?  No, I don't think so.  Would you like a dinner date?  If we could arrange that with a beautiful girl from New York Confidential, if they have  one available for a dinner date, would you be interested in that?  I'd love to.  Yeah, he's interested in that.  Well, no, I'm asking him because the lawyers will panic. 
[01:11:00]  This has been about a month in the making already, right?  Yeah, it has been a month.  So what are we going to do with this guy?  Get him laid.  Yeah.  Well, no, no, we don't know if we can get him laid.  We can just introduce him, and then whatever happens, happens.  You can't guarantee sex, but you can introduce somebody.  Well, send him on a date then.  Yeah, with a dinner date.  Why don't we just bring candy back?  That's true.  Sir, do you have $1,000?  Maybe a couple of years you've worked and saved your money, and you have a grand to blow? 
[01:11:30]  Not really.  I was kidding.  He has nothing.  Do you have like a wrap or anything?  Do you have anything to tell girls that kind of is interesting besides I took a boat to  the back of my head?  Yeah.  How long into the discussion do you mention the boat to the head?  That is the icebreaker.  I figured it was.  Thank God it wasn't an icebreaker.  You'd be dead.  Those are big boats.  When I'm out of the bar or something, people think that I'm drunk all the time, so.  Icebreaker jokes never work. 
[01:12:00]  Icebreaker jokes are very tough, man, because they hit us on a very odd level.  They're like the beheadings of humor.  Jim is saying that when he goes to the bars, everyone thinks he's drunk all the time.  What about those catamarans?  They think he's drunk?  Yeah, they think he's drunk all the time.  I was having a conversation with Jim, and you guys are doing iceberg jokes.  Oh, I'm trying.  Maybe we could just split the show in two.  Like, the right side of the speaker will have iceberg jokes, and the left side of the 
[01:12:30]  icebreaker jokes, iceberg jokes.  I'm telling you, my head is killing me.  And then on the left side, it'll be the conversation with the head wound guy.  You take your pick.  And then you can decide which one you want to listen to.  Sure.  No, sir.  He said that when he's in bars, everyone thinks he's drunk all the time.  That makes sense.  You sound a little slurred.  I do.  I know I do.  You get pulled over by the pool.  Oh, you don't drive?  You drive or no?  No, I don't drive.  Hmm.  Well, I think we should introduce him to a young lady, and hopefully they'll have a  nice dinner together. 
[01:13:00]  Well, you know what?  Maybe there's a listener out there.  Then we get away from the whole horror angle.  Maybe there's a listener out there that is willing to go out with Jim, and maybe something  will happen.  Maybe it won't.  Hey, Jim, do you walk funny?  No, I walk fine.  You walk fine?  I have a job.  I walk all day at work.  You have a problem with your eyesight, though, right?  Yeah, my vision is very screwed up.  If you want to see a picture of me, you can go to AmericanSingles.com. 
[01:13:30]  AmericanSingles.com?  Yeah.  All right.  We have to see this.  We have to see you now.  Please hold.  We're looking for ladies to date Jim, and he has really bad eyesight, so you can be a  real pig or a mess of a woman.  He don't care, right?  Jim, you'll take anything at this point, right?  Sure.  No one fat, though, right, Jim?  Right.  Good boy.  Ugly good, because you can't really tell.  Fat, you can tell.  Yeah, nothing fat.  How do I find you? 
[01:14:00]  Yeah, how do we find you on AmericanSingles.com?  The Jimster 1973.  Jimster?  Wow, hard to imagine.  That mailbox isn't full.  The Jimster.  I'm trying to find a search.  Is there a section of women seeking nautical victims?  No.  Wow.  Search by, what, city?  Just do a search, and just type in the Jimster on the right.  I can't see where the search is. 
[01:14:30]  It's right in the middle.  God damn it.  Geez, Ann, he can see it.  Yeah, he's seeing it.  I can't.  The Jimster 1973.  Correct.  The Jimster?  How many responses have you gotten?  Find a date or friend.  I'm seeking a male, female, age range.  Silch?  I see nothing about...  There's no search option on the front page, sir.  Does he get responses?  I got one response so far.  One?  How long have you been doing it? 
[01:15:00]  16 years?  Six months.  Six months.  Six months, one response.  These websites suck.  This website stinks.  They all do.  They're all bullshit.  Seeking a male, I guess.  What city are you from?  I'm from Spring Mount.  What?  P.A.  Yeah, I know.  But what city was it?  Spring Mount.  Spring?  Spring Mount?  Yeah.  Spring Mount?  Yeah.  Okay.  Spring Mount. 
[01:15:30]  Spring Mount.  Okay, I'll search for him and see if he comes up.  It's kind of like the first two instructions in a rape.  I don't know.  Nothing on that one?  I thought that would get like a little...  Oh, sorry.  I was paying attention to this.  Yeah, we're searching right here.  Nothing?  I can't.  No, nothing.  Well, Eric will figure it out.  Let Eric figure it out, eh?  Okay.  You just be funny and let Eric come in here with all the info.  Get that kid in here.  The Jimster 1973.  We'll find it.  All right.  We're hoping some ladies call and want to date you. 
[01:16:00]  Hold on the line for a sec, Jim, all right?  We're going to go to Christine in Jersey.  Christine, what's up?  Hey, how you guys doing?  Good.  Good.  Real good.  Yeah, I'm single and looking.  Okay.  Yep.  What do you look like?  I'm actually pretty tall.  You're a guy.  It's a guy.  I heard, like, right when he said looking, the last syllable of looking totally, uh, it  was a guy.  You're a guy, right?  I'm actually in the process of becoming a girl. 
[01:16:30]  Shut up.  Are you tall?  Dude, you stink.  You really just fessed it up.  You did an awful job.  Yeah, I know.  All right.  Get out of here, man.  That was terrible.  Jack, man.  And dummy, I am, so what's your number?  Yeah.  Dave.  I haven't rubbed a big back before.  Dave in Philly, what's up?  Yo, why don't we just kill two birds with one stone?  Pet this guy up with Stalker Patty.  You know, that's not a bad idea.  It never works.  She will never consent to having sex. 
[01:17:00]  All right, I'm out of here, guys.  You guys suck.  There's nobody out there.  Well, if Patty's, uh, listening to us this morning, why don't you give us a call and talk  to Jim?  I gotta find someone I care about.  That's what I gotta do first.  I'm very picky about who I'm with.  I need a nice man, a date.  And then perhaps if we talk and get to know each other for a little while, I might, you  know.  Oh, you might nothing. 
[01:17:30]  Stalker Patty's our 50-year-old virgin.  That thing is healed up.  It looks like a, you know, the same way down there, like a Barbie doll.  It's just nothing.  An appendix scar.  Yeah.  Just healed up.  An old wound.  Just another old wound.  A mouthful of Ben's cell phones.  A little teeny chiclete chest.  Jim.  Yeah.  Stalker Patty was in Boston.  It's the old drunk.  Jim, we're, uh, we're patiently waiting to see if any girls will call the show today,  okay?  So you just stay on the line.  All right.  And, uh, I don't know. 
[01:18:00]  Maybe we can find one girl that'll, that'll take one for the team and, and do something  with, uh, Jimmy there.  Let's go to Bill the cop in North Carolina.  Bill, what's up?  What's up, ONA?  Morning, beef kitsch.  Hi there, sweetie.  Hey, uh, Scott, I'll let you know the ONA Army is, uh, is working its magic down here,  and I'm probably going to get a three-day suspension over it.  Why, what happened?  Uh-oh.  Well, I'm a police officer, and I was actually on duty.  We have, uh, you know that, the England case with the Avograd prison?  Um, that's all being held down here at Fort Bragg, North Carolina.  Well, the newscaster was outside this morning, outside the gate, and there was an accident 
[01:18:30]  right there, so I was standing out there anyway with the accident.  And, uh, well, she came out and was talking on air, and I just started yelling, the monster  rain's coming!  The monster rain's coming!  And they, uh, they got it, and then I didn't even get in the car for 15 minutes after that,  and my watch commander called me and said, hey, I need you in my office at 830.  Oh, my.  Uh-oh.  So, uh, but it was aired, man.  It's a Wilmington, North Carolina van.  It's an NBC logo on the side, so if you guys can try to locate something online with it, 
[01:19:00]  you'll, you'll see it.  Uh, very cool.  So it's, um, you got, you got Monster Rain on TV?  Yeah, man, I got my, me and myself in uniform saying Monster Rain's coming.  Oh, dude, how great is that?  I even looked at it, I had my hands on my, my belt, basically on the front, like where  my handcuff case is, and I was looking up at the sky, the monster rain's coming, and  of course, here's this cop yelling, something's coming, and these freaking people duck, you  know?  They didn't know what the hell was going on.  Oh, God, I want to see that.  It was perfect.  I mean, you'd love it, man. 
[01:19:30]  The assault on the media has begun.  Go to opiananthony.com for, for past, uh.  Thank you, man.  Assaults on the media.  I would love to see a tape of that, Bill.  I don't know how.  I called my wife, uh, she's a, she's a, she's a, she's a,  she works at Womack, she's in the military, and I called her at the hospital, she works  from the, the psychotic ward, you know, so they, they all have TV up there, so I told  her if she can to try to videotape it, we'll see.  Okay, cool.  But I won't know anything until I get off, and I'll, I'll, I'll keep you guys informed  on my, uh, meeting with my lieutenant, my wife's commander, in an hour and ten minutes.  Yeah, I hope everything works out for you, all right, Bill? 
[01:20:00]  I don't give a shit.  All right, see you guys.  Thanks, Bill the Cop.  Wow, Jimster.  All right, we got, uh, Jimster's profile.  Jimster 1973.  Correct.  Single male, seeking female, age 30, Spring Mount PA.  So obviously you got, uh, the boat to the left side of the head, huh?  Yeah.  Yeah, that's, uh.  Yeah, that one eye is kind of shut, huh?  Yeah, it doesn't open.  It doesn't open.  Well, they can't fix that?  Um, they could, but they can't, it's like out in left field, that eye, and they can't, 
[01:20:30]  they can't get them working together.  It's a cranial nerve thing.  Oh, so they figure best leave it just shut.  Correct.  Instead of looking like you're looking in five different directions.  Yeah.  Exactly.  Wow.  Uh.  I also have a parrot named J.R., or is it Junior?  Uh, J.R.  Who drives Kirby a bit crazy by calling his name.  Who's Kirby?  Kirby's my Sharpay.  You named your pets in your singles ad? 
[01:21:00]  That could be the problem.  In the singles ad, you name your pets, and you mention a boating to the head.  That's a tough one to overcome, dude.  Uh, he said I'd delete it.  He said he had a boating accident.  He said I feel I need to let you know that I had a boating accident 16 years ago that  has impaired my vision to the point where I am unable to drive.  However, it does not keep me from all the things I enjoy, especially traveling.  I've been to Hawaii, Cancun, St. Martin.  Why would you go to all these places where there's a lot of water? 
[01:21:30]  On a cruise?  Wow.  I guess as big as a cruise ship, he's up pretty high.  All right.  I'd go to the desert at this point.  I've been to Saudi Arabia.  Yeah.  Right.  Iran.  The Mojave.  You know?  Just list all the deserts.  You're insane.  Key West, Bermuda, St. Martin.  He puts all those things.  Key West, yeah, Bermuda, St. Martin, Cancun, Hawaii, and Arizona.  Arizona.  It says you're 5'6", 164 pounds.  Apparently your eyesight doesn't prevent you from seeing the plate. 
[01:22:00]  5'6", 164 is really not that bad.  You just crashed.  That's what I was trying to...  You just crashed bad.  I can't wait.  I didn't even see it coming.  Jimmy.  Jim, we're still waiting for a girl to call in.  The plate.  There's got to be one listener out there that's willing to go out on a date with Jim.  Booger, what's up?  Hey, what's going on, guys?  Hey.  Hey, you guys, great show. 
[01:22:30]  Morning, Jimmy Norton.  Morning.  Hey, what are you doing the 23rd, Jimmy?  Anything, man?  Nah, you know what?  I'll be at the downtown Long Island performing.  But no, it's not about that today, man, about my shows at the downtown.  I can't even find the number to plug it.  Oh.  Hey, what a gig.  Hold on, mister.  Why don't you...  Mr. 516-293-7700.  You're an angel.  Oh, thank you so much.  Hey, why don't you give a ma-fi to a lucky listener to come in and fuck two trains out?  Well, that would be illegal, sir.  Yeah, we can't do that. 
[01:23:00]  That would be trading some type of merchandise for sexual favors.  I do believe that's plug-ola.  His activities are listed as motorcycles.  Why don't you give somebody to come in for a dinner date then?  All right, Booger, we'll try to figure it out.  Thank you.  Motorcycling, dude.  Activities listed as motorcycling.  Mm-hmm.  You still motorcycle?  Oh, wait, where is he?  No, I'm here.  Oh, okay.  Yeah, are you motorcycle?  No.  Why is that listed on your activities?  Um, I don't motorcycle. 
[01:23:30]  I bicycle.  Were you able to see these activities when you were writing them down?  Because it says motorcycling, pool, billiards, darts?  I don't think I want to be around you if you're going to be throwing darts.  No, I don't play darts.  I play shi shi shi pull on Tuesday night, week.  Do you play darts with the little round Velcro darts, the safe ones?  No, I don't play darts.  Can I ask why under personality it says adventurous, wild, spontaneous, and then conservative and  clean cut in the same sentence? 
[01:24:00]  I don't know.  Was there a big menu of things you could pick out, pick and choose?  It was huge.  You selected everything?  He just shut his eyes and picked one.  Oh, he didn't.  All right, well, still waiting for a girl to call up.  We'll see what happens here.  Dude, we couldn't get a midget who wanted to get laid.  That chick would have banged a midget if we couldn't get one of them.  My idea of the perfect first date, I would love to take my date to a Phillies game, sit  in my season ticket seats, and dinner before the game at Harry the K's restaurant. 
[01:24:30]  What's Harry the K's restaurant?  Harry Cowell's restaurant.  It's in Citizen's Bank Ballpark.  It's really nice.  All right.  Then a long ride home from the game with the sunroof open and chatting to each other.  Sunroof open, you wouldn't be afraid a car might come in there and hit you on the other  side of the head?  No.  And who's driving the car home?  Well, she would be.  Yeah.  And when we get to your home, I will walk you to your door where I can hopefully give you  a kiss and call it the night.  Oh.  Wow, a little forward. 
[01:25:00]  Yeah.  A little kiss, huh?  I'm expecting a kiss.  All right.  Well, so far, no luck there, Jim.  Oh, well.  And his birthday's Friday.  We've got to do something.  You like snorkeling and scuba diving?  Yes.  I'm a certified scuba diver.  Wow, that's scary, too.  A lot of people do get hit in the head with boats.  But he's not really doing any of that stuff anymore, right?  No, I don't do it anymore, Craig. 
[01:25:30]  Oh.  All right.  Hold on a minute.  Anthony from Oceanside wants in.  Anthony?  What's up?  Hey, yeah.  We're talking to Jim.  Oh, my God.  You guys are killing me.  I'll suck his fucking dick.  Just get him off the radio.  You'll suck the guy's dick to end this bit?  I'll suck his dick.  What do you think about that, Cupcake?  All right, well, you know what?  We're doing the eggnog drinking contest on Friday, and it is your birthday.  Maybe you could come down and check that out.  I'm up for it. 
[01:26:00]  Well, that's got to be better than getting laid.  Just watching a bunch of guys drink eggnog until they puke.  Yeah, who cares about a hot chick?  What I've learned from the past, to talk to each other before things go south.  I had the perfect girlfriend and ended it because we did not talk about the important things in life.  Yeah, so it ended not so nicely, but it was a while ago, and that is that, I guess.  What happened with your girlfriend?  Well, we broke up after my birding accident. 
[01:26:30]  Oh, wow.  So you're talking 15 years old and stuff.  Yes.  So how old was she?  She was 14.  Oh, and she couldn't deal with it, huh?  Right.  Of course not.  Oh.  But she's 14.  I know.  That's the reality of it.  You can't deal with that, especially at that age.  It's bad that you still, like, don't tell girls that because they'll think you're insane  that you're still talking about a relationship you had when you were 15.  Yeah.  You've got to move on from that.  That's kind of like the borderline of his life, though, back then.  His life.  Like, you can remember before that, he's just a normal kid having a little fun, and then 
[01:27:00]  after that, it's just been this long dry spell.  Well, what happened with the boat?  How did the boat actually hit you?  The steering mechanism on our boat failed, making our boat very sharply to the left.  Another boat came up from behind the bountiful back in the bar, and it bowed up and hit me  directly in the back of the head.  So you probably should have died.  Correct.  Okay.  Kenny, what's up?  We've got Kenny from Texas. 
[01:27:30]  Go ahead, Kenny.  I was distracted throwing a body out of his boat.  That sucks.  Go ahead, Kenny.  Yeah, I was just calling to tell him I'd talk to my blow-up doll, and, geez, you'll  go out with him.  A lot of sympathetic people on the iPhone.  Jim, you want a blow-up doll, maybe?  No.  Have you tried any of those spanking aids or anything, you know?  No.  No, huh?  All right.  Well, I don't know.  We're going to try to find him a girl.  It's not looking good, though.  Who do you live with?  His eye looks like Steve after he hit it with the cardboard box yesterday, doesn't it? 
[01:28:00]  When Steve kept coming in, his eye was all puffy.  It looks like he got stung by a bee in the left eye.  Right.  Not a bad-looking guy, though.  No.  Kind of looks like someone.  I can't figure it out, though.  Every guy in the Genevieve family who's on trial for something?  Maybe that's it.  You do look kind of like a mobster.  All right.  We're going to punch you out of this.  That's your gym update.  We'll try to find you something, James.  He's on hold. 
[01:28:30]  Maybe a lady will call the show.  If not, he'll just kind of stay on hold all day.  All right?  There you go.  You want to call him back so he doesn't waste his phone bill?  Good luck, guys.  Jim, we're going to call you back and keep you on hold just in case a lady decides to  call in, okay?  All right.  Nothing but guys so far.  Sorry.  I know.  We're doing our best.  All right.  We're going to take a break, and we'll continue in just a bit here.  It is a natural impulse to grab and squeeze the breasts.  Squeeze the breasts.  No shit. 
[01:29:00]  It's real, real soft.  Almost like pudding.  Almost like pudding.  Yes.  A hot piece of ass.  What a handful.  Yeah.  The nipples are so sensitive that a mere tweak between finger and thumb will give a perfectly  good result.  We hope you're in every show.  In case you didn't know.

That's why I'm so depressed all the time.  I figured it out.  I watch too much CNN, man.  I don't know if you've ever sat around and watched CNN longer than, say, 20 hours in 
[01:30:30]  one day.  I don't recommend that.  Watch CNN headline news for one hour.  It's the most depressing thing you'll ever fucking do.  War, famine, death, AIDS, homeless, recession, depression.  War, famine, death, AIDS, homeless.  Then you look out your window.  Where's all this shit happening?  Ted Turner's making this shit up, man. 
[01:31:00]  Jane Fonda won't sleep with him.  He runs to a typewriter.  By 1992, we will all die of AIDS.  Read that on the air.  I don't get laid.  No one gets laid.  I'm writing, Jane Fonda.  Will you fuck this guy so we can get some good news, please?  I want to see a well-laid Ted Turner newscast.  Hey, it's all going to work out.  Here's sports. 
[01:31:30]  This is the nicest part of the South.  This isn't the only part of the South you go, like, when I go there, nobody goes, man,  I wish you could take me back to New York with you.  You go to, like, Mississippi motherfuckers be hiding in your car and shit.  Shit, bro. 
[01:32:00]  It's nice here.  Too hot, bro.  This ain't no place to be in, like, July.  Shit.  Get the fuck out of here, man.  It's hot every day.  90 degrees and shit.  It's, like, hotter than ten niggas in a Volkswagen.  100 channels of crystal clear digital audio.  XM satellite radio.  Radio to the power of X.  Can you say fuck on this channel? 
[01:32:30]  Oh, Jesus.  That's shocking.  Holy fuck, I need coffee.  Do you have an Audi?  This is the best show ever.  The O.P. and Anthony Show.  You're checking out the One virus spreading across America thanks to XM satellite radio. 
[01:33:00]  How are the celebrity guests stacking up?  Ben, have we...  Who's the Tom Cruise of today that...  Well, we had Tommy Chong yesterday.  That was pretty cool.  I thought it was a really cool interview.  It was great.  And today we got, what, Gene Simmons?  Gene Simmons.  Who loves me.  Remember him yelling at me?  Why'd he yell at you?  Because I was moving carts next to O.P.  Don't do that when Gene's talking.  Why are you doing that?  Yeah, he gets... 
[01:33:30]  All angry.  Yeah, man, he's my chair squeaking.  All trying to sound articulate.  And then meanwhile...  He's very articulate, though.  Bastard.  And then he's showing O.P. his KISS credit card.  Remember that?  Yeah.  I could turn you on to a credit card with a low interest rate.  It's wonderful.  Like, what?  Because he has the KISS credit card.  And he shows you he's got the KISS credit cards.  I love Gene.  He's just such a...  I don't know.  And you can't even call him out on it because he agrees with it.  Well, he's probably the most honest celebrity in Hollywood.  All he does... 
[01:34:00]  Honest sellout?  Well, he just tells the truth about everything, which I like.  You know, he just wants to dump loads and bang different chicks.  He doesn't care who knows it.  Good for him.  We won't get married.  Never yell at our Ben again, though.  I don't like that either.  But he's one of my boyhood idols.  And I creaked my chair and he glared at me.  And I'm like, I'm sorry.  Hey, Martini Steve.  We can clear the phone lines.  We're done with Jim the boat guy for now, unless the lady calls.  Martini Steve, back in the studio.  Now, you've got the Gene Simmons lecture tour audio.  What's this all about?  Gene Simmons of KISS went off to do a lecture tour in Australia. 
[01:34:30]  I think it was three or five dates.  And he basically is doing this Tony Robbins type of...  Thank you.  Sometimes right in the middle of what Steve is saying.  Thought I was going to get away with it at that time.  Anyway.  God, completely fucking derailed me every time.  All right.  So Gene's now decided to do this lecture tour.  Right. 
[01:35:00]  Just to...  Well, he...  Yes, Jim?  Oh, God.  Steve, you're a professional broadcaster.  All right.  You're absolutely right.  Oh, my God.  Was that real?  Oh.  What was real?  What?  Jim farted.  Yeah, Jim just blew one out.  It was, like, loud.  Like, audible fart.  So Gene is doing this lecture tour.  Can I tell you?  Can I tell you? 
[01:35:30]  You know he's got some flaming shoes  The cons that Pyra would admire  He makes contestants bring in food  And he runs the boundary music empire  Martini, Steve's clothes are on fire  Martini, Steve's clothes are on fire  He only buys flaming attire 
[01:36:00]  His clothing's like a barbecue  His laundry never needs a dryer  If you're selling burning shoes  If you're selling burning shoes  This drunken Lebanese will fire  Martini, Steve's clothes are on fire  Martini, Steve's clothes are on fire  He only buys flaming attire  He only buys flaming attire  Yeah, yeah 
[01:36:30]  You know he's got some flaming shoes  The kind that Satan would desire  If you're with him drinking boots  A smoke detector is required  Martini, Steve's clothes are on fire  Martini, Steve's clothes are on fire  He only buys flaming attire  He only buys flaming attire  Martini, Steve's clothes are on fire 
[01:37:00]  Martini, Steve's clothes are on fire  Great job by Anthony  Fine parody  The Martini, Steve's song  And just to see Steve, hear the song  And I'm looking at Steve  And he is indeed on fire  I told you I would overcompensate today  So I have the flaming boots  The flaming hat  And the flaming shirt 
[01:37:30]  When are you going to get the flaming pants?  And the flaming lifestyle  Well, that's still in the closet  Yeah, flaming pants  He's not kidding anyone anymore  I don't know where to get flaming pants  To be honest with you  I've looked  I wouldn't know where  I had no idea where to get them  But I'm sure if I looked  Anyway  Back to the Gene Simmons audio  Yeah  So Gene's doing a lecture tour  Or he has done a lecture tour  Where he preaches his Caligula lifestyle  To an auditorium full of people  And in my opinion  Does a very convincing job  Of doing so  Because here's a guy  Who's worth $100 million  Has a 30 year run 
[01:38:00]  In the music business  Owns his own record company  His own film company  Published two books  Continues to bring in revenue  And this is just now  Another revenue stream  Isn't it more of a fluke though  Than something Gene really built  Like a businessman  Would have to  I don't know  It seems kind of like  If it wasn't for his  A bunch of his dopey fans  Buying anything  This guy puts out  Sure  You know, he's got a license  To print money  That's pretty much what it is  Essentially, yeah  He built one solid revenue stream  With the band 
[01:38:30]  And that gives him the opportunity  To fuel cash  Into other revenue streams  But he's also  A very good salesperson  And convinces other people  To invest money  Into his ideas  I mean, when  You hear him talk about  Especially on this  In this lecture tour  About  Banks giving him  $500 million  Of rotating credit  To produce films  Internationally  I mean, you know  That's not because  He's the bass player for Kiss  That's because he's a good salesman  And convinced them  That he could do it  And don't forget  To look how many rock bands  Burn out and have nothing  And blow their money 
[01:39:00]  And wind up with shit  I mean, he is a bright guy, man  Yeah, but he's got that base  Of fans that will just buy  Any piece of crap  And he goes around like a  Searching for people  That are selling his wares  Without a license  But other bands  Try to do that  And they weren't as successful  They can't do it  It's because  They have another band  That was able to  Market themselves  The way Kiss did  Or Gene Simmons did  They just need that  Passionate fan base  And for some reason  Kiss has it  Kiss has it  For some reason  They always delivered though  Kiss always delivered  With stuff like that 
[01:39:30]  You see them live  They're phenomenal  They push you down the stairs  Later on  They hug you  They love you  Make you feel better  The reason is  Because they just look like  Superheroes  I think that had a lot  To do with it  And the prevailing rumor  Is that they're basically  Going to dump the personalities  Behind all the makeup  And just franchise the band  Turned out into  I guess a glorified cover act  The thought being that  It doesn't really matter  Who's under the makeup  You could put anybody  In those four kabuki masks  So they're going to put  Put out Kiss franchises  Yeah  And sell it as Kiss 
[01:40:00]  Like Kiss will be  Performing live  Yeah it hasn't been confirmed  But that's a rumor  That's been going around  For a couple years  I don't think so either  People like the personalities  People like Paul Stanley  And Gene  And people  Why don't you say I  I like  The whole world likes them  Well this brings back  A discussion we've had  On many occasions  A lot of these bands  Are going to go on forever  Uh huh  They're just going to go on forever  You know you fast forward  20, 25 years  And there's going to be  A version of let's say  The Rolling Stones 
[01:40:30]  Or you know  These bands  With one guy left  Some of these bands  Are going on  They don't even have  Any original members  Left anymore  But the name is still  You know  Markable  The name  Yeah  You know  We mentioned a bunch  Of the bands  I can't remember right now  But just think of  All the bands  You know and love  Yeah Skinner  There's a perfect example  I think they're down  To one original member  One or two yeah  And they still tour  And they still tour  As Leonard Skinner  Yeah  Sabbath did it with Iommi  Like after  Like at one point  It all left  It was just Black Sabbath  Featuring Tony Iommi 
[01:41:00]  When everybody else  Had left  It's just not the same  But it's going to  Yeah but some of these bands  Will be able to pull it off  And the name of the band  Will actually just keep going on  And on and on  Even though all the original  Members are gone  Kiss won't  Huh  No  You figure if you scale it down  And you put it in casinos  Why not  So you're playing to auditoriums  Rather than stadiums  It's still a revenue stream  Well cover bands  I mean yeah the cover bands  I mean there's going to be like  Joe's YouTube band  I mean there's always going to be  Cover bands  And they could say Kiss supports  Or franchise them  But they're not going to be  Billed as Kiss  That's the point though  These would 
[01:41:30]  It would never sell  Kiss 2  You know  Kiss squared  You know  Kiss cubed  They're touring now  With 50% of the original band  And two other guys  In Aces and Peters makeup  Yeah there you go  And they're still filling  Huge venues  But they've been doing that  Since 1980  Because Ace left  I think Ace left first  Or Peter left  Peter left first  Peter left first  Like around 79-80  After the dynasty thing  They kind of had  Most of their guys  Two of their guys  They've been doing that  For 25 years  But you think they could  Ever pull it off  Without Gene or Paul  Never  One or the other leaves 
[01:42:00]  Absolutely not  And it's just Gene Simmons  I don't know  You have that argument  With Leonard Skinner  And they're still  Selling out like crazy  Don't forget that  They don't have a 30 year history  Like Kiss does  With Gene and Paul either  I mean they were great  Leonard Skinner  But 30 years  Yeah but slowly but surely  Then Paul Stanley  Leaves the band  I mean he just had  Hip replacement surgery  Recently  Did he really?  He did have some kind of surgery  And so let's say  All of a sudden  He decides to retire  Then it's down to Gene Simmons  And then the other guys  Start making a name  For themselves in the band  And then all of a sudden  Gene steps aside  Then there you go  You got another band 
[01:42:30]  With four members  That weren't original  And the name goes on  Transitional phase  Where you got some of the  Original guys  And some new guys  I don't know  Vinny Vincent they had  Eric Carr for a long time  Well he died  You really know  You know about Kiss  Well you know what  I'm more of an old school  Kiss fan  I like the original  The only one I haven't met  Is Ace  I'm actually an original  Four guys  Yeah  Jeff what's up?  Hey I heard on  I read on GlideMagazine.com  That Queen is going to be  Playing with Paul Rogers 
[01:43:00]  As vocals  Really?  From Bad Company?  Yeah Bad Company at 3  That's awful  Yeah I was  I was surprised  That Queen didn't go on  Why?  That's kind of a hard  Guy to replace  Well I understand that  But a lot of the other bands  Have attempted it  With new singers  I was surprised  They never tried it  Nirvana never did  I mean those guys  Went on to other projects  But that was the end  Of the band  I mean you know  It's like when  At least Sam goes  Kurt Cobain was the whole band  Same with Queen  Those guys  I mean Dave Grohl  Proved that he was  An incredibly talented guy 
[01:43:30]  But Kurt Cobain  Never wanted to hear his songs  Or anything like that  He could care less about them  He just said shut up  And you know  Drum my song  Yeah  You know the first  Foo Fighters album  With Dave Grohl  Was a lot of songs  That Dave brought  To Kurt Cobain  For Nirvana  And Kurt was like  This is garbage  Oops  And it turns out  That you know  He was writing  Some really good stuff  That could have been  Some nice Nirvana songs  And Chris Novoselic  Really took off  And went  Yeah  What?  You know  Where?  He was just  A really good friend  With Kurt  Shut up 
[01:44:00]  So Kurt was pompous  About his music  With even the other band members  Oh yeah yeah yeah  It was all about  He wrote just about  Everything  Just about  All about me  Bands changing members  Yeah here's another one  Yes  Big Ed  On Long Island  What's up Big Ed  Hey guys  Hi Sweetums  Hi Big Ed  Thanks for calling the program  I love you baby  You guys suck  You know  Talking about all these bands  Changing members  Look at Yes  They stink  Yeah but John Anderson  How many times  Have they changed members  Over and over and over again  I mean there was nobody  In the original band there 
[01:44:30]  And they still called it Yes  John Anderson  Was he there the whole time?  I don't know  That's a good question  I don't know either  I don't think he was  Yeah but that's different though  Okay  Yeah and  You guys suck  I'm out of here  Bye fella  And you know  I was going to say this  Let Jeremiah say it in California  Go ahead Jeremiah  Hey little Jimmy  Hi Jeremiah  How you doing sweet cheeks  Better now  Thanks  You just made a comment 
[01:45:00]  That Leonard Skinner  Didn't have a 30 year history  Like Kiss  I know  I mean with  With the two guys  Like Gene and Paul  What I'm saying is  Gene and Paul  Have been at the forefront  Of Kiss for 30 years  Whereas I mean  Leonard Skinner  How long were they together  Before the plane crash  Like five years  Or something  Or six years  Yeah it was like  Well it was closer to 10  Ronnie Van Zandt  The plane crashed  In like 76 or 77  It was 77  Okay 77  But after that  There were a lot  Of the original members 
[01:45:30]  And it was Ronnie Van Zandt's  Brother Johnny  That came in  And started singing  Yeah and he's been singing  He's been singing with them  For over 10 years now already  Yeah well  Yeah I guess  No my point  My point was just that  Gene and Paul  Are irreplaceable  In that band  And I think you know  Ronnie Van Zandt  Probably you could consider  Irreplaceable  Even though they technically did  But Skinner  No one thinks of Skinner  After 77 really  That's not true  They're still huge  In the south  Absolutely huge  But how many songs  Leonard Skinner's songs 
[01:46:00]  And they actually  They put out  A bunch of songs since  And a couple of them  Had gotten some good radio  Airplay  It's not like  I can't either  No I can't either  But I just know  You know it's no  Freebird or anything like that  Sure but they did  Put out albums  And a couple of them  Made the radio  And got some airplay  No I'm not saying  They didn't  But I'm saying like  When you think  Leonard Skinner  You think  Sweet Home Alabama  You think you think  You know  Van Zandt  Ronnie Van Zandt  That's just what  No I wasn't trying  To argue with you  I just  No I'm actually  I'm actually  I'm actually  Countering  Ope's point here 
[01:46:30]  On Point Counterpoint  Jason from New Hampshire  What's up Jason  Hey I just wanted  To say  You know why  Queen didn't continue  Why  They couldn't find  Their shit dick  With a set of  Choppers like that  You guys keep  Tempting me  To play that damn song  Freddie Mercury  Shit dick  Shit dick  I love the part  When he goes  Judas Priest  Shit dick  And he kind of  Sings it like  The heavy metal  Shit dick vocals  You still can't find  Your shit dick song

[01:49:30]  Sick  Rawr  That's becoming a classic on the Opie and Anthony show, huh?  Who doesn't love the shit dick song?  God  We get so many requests for that stupid song every day.  You'll love that one, huh, Jimmy?  It's hilarious.  Yeah, we'll make a copy of that for you.  And even after you stop laughing, you still kind of enjoy the song.  It has a nice little feel to it, right?  Yeah, I don't...  Drive around going, yeah, shit dick.  Yeah, DC, what's up?  Yeah, man, what's up?  How you doing, shit dick?  Shit dick. 
[01:50:00]  AC, DC, new singer.  I believe it's been replaced once or twice, Andy.  No, Brian Johnson came.  We have to bond Scott.  I don't think there's anyone else.  Yeah, just Brian Johnson.  Very successful there.  Yeah, there's another example.  I mean, all right, so then let's say the rest of the guys leave, Brian Johnson continues,  now you got a band that's very successful that has no original members.  Oh, true.  Sabbath replaced Ozzy.  I mean, look, Dio came along, wasn't the same, though, but they still replaced him and  went on and were very successful.  Did well.  Yeah, absolutely.  So let's get back to the Gene Simmons audio, Steve. 
[01:50:30]  Okay.  He's touring, right?  That's what we were doing.  What's that?  No, he's touring.  And we're going to have Gene Simmons call on the show later.  Yeah, a little bit later.  All right, so we got some clips of his lecture tour, right?  Yeah, this was maybe six months ago in Australia in front of a lot of people.  Good lecture.  Thank you.  And now is he selling this lecture?  Yeah, it's called, what is it called?  Speaking in Tongues is the name of the DVD.  Oh, it ties in.  Yeah, exactly.  Now, everything is a play on the whole kiss and big tongue thing.  Of course it is.  Well, that's how you market it.  He knows that kiss is what made him famous, so he's happy to tie it in in some way, shape, 
[01:51:00]  or form.  And if people want to buy it, they buy it.  And I think that misconception is that he's not, you know, you can't force anybody to  buy something.  So if he wants to put a $5,000 kiss coffin on the market and see if anybody buys it.  Well, he sold one.  Yeah.  It's true.  Oh, yeah, right.  Where's that misconception?  Nobody thinks people are being forced to buy kiss socks?  Well, what?  Yeah, I think so.  I think a lot of the fans feel gypped.  They're like, stop selling stuff.  Yeah, I think they feel like, you know, it's selling out, but he's so beyond selling out. 
[01:51:30]  This is so far, you know, above and beyond the realm of selling out.  He's not telling anybody they have to spend their money on it.  He's just putting it on the market.  If they buy it, they buy it.  I don't think he's selling out, though.  Well, you're insane.  I'm buying in.  I like, I always like the kiss merchandise.  I really do.  It's fun.  Yeah, but it is a sellout.  A bit much.  If you look at the standards of other bands that are like, no, man, we're not selling our  music or, you know.  Kiss takes a whole other direction there.  But then what's the point of forming a band? 
[01:52:00]  If you're just going to form a band and remain impoverished, then, you know, do it in your  spare time.  Some of them seem to want that.  The second they get any success, they're fans, and sometimes even the band gets a little  aggravated.  It's not Metallica's sellouts.  Yeah, it's BS.  I think every band wants to be absolutely huge, and they play it the other way.  Like, oh, man, we're getting too commercial.  We hate it, blah, blah, blah.  I know, yeah.  I think every band starts out in a garage wanting to become huge rock stars.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Why else would you do it?  And if they're saying, if they're telling you differently, then they're just not, they're 
[01:52:30]  not true to themselves, and they're liars.  Yeah.  You know?  True.  You're right.  Yeah, or you'd just stay in the garage.  Yeah, exactly.  And get a day job and, you know, make a livable wage.  Although the fans are ridiculous sometimes.  You know, you get into a band that's a little underground, you know, and then they get popular,  and you start getting pissed at the band.  Like, yeah, you're so commercial.  But the truth of the matter is, you're pissed off because you thought you were so hip and  so cool that you knew about this band, and then you realize that you're just another guy 
[01:53:00]  Absolutely.  that was into a sound that was very commercial.  Just so happened that you were onto a little earlier.  This is what a deluded idiot I am.  I would always hear a song, and I could always kind of tell, like, wow, that's going to be  a hit.  I would pick hits.  And I'm like, wow, I have a knack for that.  And then it dawned on me, hey, asshole, it becomes a hit because everybody thinks the same  thing when they hear it.  Is he doing Norton like this?  Insightful genius.  Everyone goes, hey, that's a toe-tapper, and it becomes a hit.  Stupid. 
[01:53:30]  So, yeah.  I could identify those hits.  Yeah, I really can.  There's another one.  Just me and a billion other people who enjoy the same song.  But that's just my insight.  Fool I am.  Yeah, it's what it is.  It's self-centered people that get a little pissed off because they thought they were special.  But anything you do, and as a band especially, people say you're going commercial.  Any Metallica, what was large, was criticizing Napster.  He was a sellout.  Gene does this.  He's a sellout.  Whatever you do, they call you that.  Unless you die young.  That's the only way you're not.  I mean, Dimebag even. 
[01:54:00]  Look, I mean, as heavy as he was or whatever, this guy, this maniac called him, he's a sellout  or whatever he called him for leaving the band.  Whenever you do shit they don't like, that's what they use.  It's annoying.  Nice to know that there are kooks for every occasion.  Absolutely.  Even that guy.  All right.  Well, let's listen to some of this Gene Simmons audio from the lecture tour.  And that's that, Gene.  When I was a little boy, I felt completely destroyed.  I was completely sort of devastated by the notion that even though somebody never really  knew who I am, they were willing to tell me that I was stupid. 
[01:54:30]  What are you, stupid?  Can't you even speak English?  I felt devastated when I first heard that.  Nobody is allowed to take you down without your permission.  Nobody is allowed to insult you without your permission.  Nobody can say anything bad about you unless you agree with it.  I know it's an idea they don't teach you in school.  So I thought about this and I said, well, I'm not stupid.  I know I can't speak English, so maybe I don't have language skills, but no, I'm not stupid.  And one day I'm going to make sure you, asshole, are going to work for me. 
[01:55:00]  If he didn't understand English, how did he know what somebody said to him about speaking English?  Yeah, he's a little weird.  What does that mean?  Because you're preaching to a very insecure crowd of people that probably got called names,  and this guy thinks that he's going to tell you not to believe what people tell you.  And here's a guy that's worth $100 million saying that.  It's a little easy for him.  He's Jim Simmons.  Exactly. 
[01:55:30]  What does that mean, though?  You can't allow people...  Only you can allow people to call you stupid and call you names if you don't allow it.  It's a very ass-backwards way of saying it's only an insult if you buy into it kind of thing.  It's only, you know, sticks and stones may break my bones kind of thing.  Yeah, it's easy when you're taking the KISS limo into your gated house.  True.  To get away from that, but he's selling this to...  What does this cost?  What is the DVD?  I got the $15 DVD, I think.  That's it? 
[01:56:00]  Because I know those courses that people teach, motivational courses.  Oh, I'm sure a ticket to this wasn't like $100.  Probably a lot of money.  Yeah, exactly.  This is more about Gene wanting to...  Gene likes to talk.  I think he likes to heal.  With his mouth full?  I'm sorry.  I'm a fucking slob.  I'm sorry.  Stop feeding your face.  I'm eating an apple.  I'm being healthy.  Listen, crunchy apple, good for big boy.  Big boy eats his apple.  I'll talk after the next clip.  Let me show you.  All right, let me do the next clip here.  Mothers are the most amazing things on the face of the planet, and I hope you love yours 
[01:56:30]  as much as I love mine.  That's forever.  She gave me life.  And she's the only one that ever had the right and continues to always have the right  as long as I'm alive to ask me where I'm going, who I've been with, and when I come  home.  Anti-marriage.  Yeah, we all know he's anti-marriage.  Well, that's the next clip, which I love.  I agree with him on that whole thing.  That theory on marriage is great.  Yeah.  Want to go right to it?  Sure.  I believe that what everybody should do is to sit down before you get married and make 
[01:57:00]  a list out.  What do I want from you, and what do you want from me?  Don't let the laws of the land dictate to you, because here's what's going to happen.  And you're going to get, what's good for the goose is not good for the gander.  I'm going to tell you the exact opposite for women.  Marriage.  I hope I scared you, because it scares the shit out of me.  And I, you know, like the sumo wrestlers, my balls get pulled right back into my body.  And that's not good.  So, you're going out on your first date, and you get serious, and you want to get married, 
[01:57:30]  and so the guy says to the girl, listen, I want to be completely honest with you.  I really love you with all my heart, and I won't do the jokes.  I'm just going to be serious.  I want to spend, perhaps, the rest of my days with you.  I don't know, but on the chance, and statistics bear this out, you will get divorced.  On the chance that we might get divorced, or that I might turn to bestiality.  If we get divorced, how much money would you like from me? 
[01:58:00]  Half.  She might say, that's so unromantic.  You better run the fuck out of that room now.  You just will run as fast as you can, because when honesty goes out the window,  you've got to reach deep down inside.  As I understand it, the laws of divorce, because the biggest cause of divorce is marriage, right?  It goes hand in hand.  So the cost of divorce, as I'm told, is 50% of your gross pre-tax dollars to somebody you just met as a grown-up 
[01:58:30]  and decide to spend a few years with, if you get divorced.  This is more than the woman who gave you birth will ever get your mother.  Who invented that system?  And additionally, if you have a child together, whatever, there's another 20%.  So 70%, I'm told here, in America it's only 50%, of your gross pre-tax dollars is going to go to another human being.  That's more than the taxes you pay to the government you live in. 
[01:59:00]  Now, by the way, Australia gives you nuclear armed forces, police, military, an infrastructure, highways, fire, everything,  and access to as many females as you want.  They'll never say, when are you coming home and who have you been with?  By the way, you still have to pay the tax, whether you get divorced or not.  She will still get her 50% to 70%.  Your mom will get crap.  And you, the guy that earned all the money, is like, what do you get?  Bravo. 
[01:59:30]  Has he ever been married?  No.  No, he's got, he's figured out a way.  I actually had this conversation when he was at NEW.  He's got a cohab agreement, a cohabitation agreement.  And it's a contract that you draw up with somebody who you want to live with.  That is, in every way, shape, and form, similar to marriage, but it doesn't bind you legally, financially, to the same.  Isn't that great?  If you spout off like that enough, and you're in the public eye enough, it's not something that you get rejected for when you're presented to a woman. 
[02:00:00]  Like, it's known.  Like, any chick that's with Gene Simmons is not going to go, oh, you know, like he said, that's so unromantic.  Or why, you know, you don't love me as a, she's with Gene Simmons, who is known for this.  Right.  How do you swing that as a guy?  I bet you Shannon tweeted, if they split, would get something.  But I mean, not pushing it.  Probably based on what he felt he would want to give her.  Then it would still be plenty of money.  Although I'm sure that his brilliant speaking things, when done in a court in California, might not work quite as well in front of a judge. 
[02:00:30]  Your Honor, I think that, uh, shut up.  Shut up.  Sit down.  Have your lawyer speak.  Lawyer dressed as Paul Stanley.  That'd be something.  You all come into court.  Don't tug on anybody's shirt sleeve to find out if it's okay to be happy while you're alive.  If that means making more money and getting more girls and girls, if it means getting more guys, do it.  If everybody gets pissed off, who cares?  The idea is you have responsibility yourself to make yourself happy.  All right.  Well, is he talking about just all the chicks he's with and no commitment? 
[02:01:00]  Exactly.  So he basically just spouts off for a couple hours and tells people, you know, how he justifies living his existence in the way he does.  And they pay to see this.  And they pay to see this.  The unrealistic thing is, you know, especially with the girls, he's had such a huge pool of women to draw from for 25, 30 years.  Yeah.  How can he equate himself or how can you transcend that knowledge or that wisdom to somebody who's making, you know, 30 grand?  You're Joe Car Salesman. 
[02:01:30]  You're not picking up women like Gene Sinclair.  Miracle, some kiss geek is sitting there listening to Gene talk about how you swing three, four women at a time.  He can't get one date.  Exactly.  I raised that when we interviewed Gene at NEW.  I actually mentioned that very politely, of course.  Of course.  But how do you, being in kiss, it's a little easier to tell girls, I'm not going to be monogamous.  I'm going to go out and do what I want.  And then, you know, meanwhile, the regular schmuck can't, I want to see other people.  She's like, fuck you.  And you're finished.  Kind of, you can't live by kiss rule.  I live by finish.  That's a good point. 
[02:02:00]  You can't live by kiss rule.  You try and try, but you just can't.  And if you want to talk on a little telephone and jerk all over the place, that's perfectly your prerogative.  And if you want to gossip about Boston.  You could be herky or jerky.  It doesn't matter which one.  No one has the right to tell you to comb your hair except for your mother.  50% of your hair is going one way, and 50% is going the other way. 
[02:02:30]  And your scalp is in the middle going, what do you want from me?  It's a sporty shirt, Ben.  Yeah.  That is nice, Diesel.  Everyone's wearing their warm weather clothing today.  Yes.  Especially Steve.  I think we're done with the Gene Simmons thing.  Yeah.  It'll be fun to chat with him.  But yeah, he's supposed to be on the phone.  What are the odds that we're getting?  Oh, no.  This one will happen.  He'll call.  Oh, it will. 
[02:03:00]  What time?  9.30.  All right.  And also...  And then what about these?  We got the girls from The Apprentice.  Ooh.  And I hear there are a bunch of...  Do they have XM?  A bunch of...  I heard they've been difficult to deal with.  A little bit.  I'm hearing there are a bunch of biatches.  You never know, though.  What's going on with these girls?  I don't even know them.  I don't watch the show.  This should be interesting.  Yeah, this should be an awful interview.  Have you watched the show, Jimmy?  The Apprentice?  Dude.  Get out of here.  Opie, have you watched it?  Nope.  Ben? 
[02:03:30]  Nope.  This will be a complete train wreck.  No, I've seen it.  I know who they are.  They're in here.  They're in Maxim.  I've seen clips.  All right, so why are they coming on the show?  Elizabeth...  Plugging Maxim, probably.  Ivana and Stacey R.  They pick her just because of her name.  Like Donald had to deal with Ivana.  Ben, question for you.  Why are they coming on the air?  They want to do something with XM.  Eric knows better than I do.  They want to do something with XM.  I don't know.  They're driving everyone crazy.  Is it driving Eric nuts?  Eric, I'll pass a question. 
[02:04:00]  Eric, why are they coming on our show?  And how difficult have they been?  I haven't talked to the other two.  One of them has been very difficult.  Which one?  Stacey R.  Stacey R.  She actually hung up on me on Friday because she was too busy jogging to talk about getting  this stuff squared away.  Hung up on you?  Yeah.  She's like, well, I don't have time to deal with this.  Call me later or I'll get in touch with you and hung up.  She's like, I'm busy jogging.  Okay.  Do these girls realize their 15 minutes of fame is just about up?  No.  Well, now let's see what happens in the interview now. 
[02:04:30]  Let's not prejudge negatively.  26.  So what do they expect to do for XM Satellite Radio?  A radio show?  Apparently they have a talk show that's been pitched down and DC said, well, before we go  any further, we're going to throw you on Opie and Anthony and see how you do.  Oh, this is almost like an audition for them.  So they have to be nice.  I'm sure they want.  Hey, let them sit there.  No, we don't.  We'll give them the show for a couple of minutes.  This seems like a perfect show for the little doggy company.  Yeah.  Let them have the girls.  I don't know.  This stuff never works. 
[02:05:00]  Do like a prison visit or something.  You guys are being like negative Nellies.  I think this could go very well and sometimes you think that someone's going to be difficult  and they turn out to be fantagious.  All right.  Well, we'll see what happens.  It's three girls that want to do a radio show for XM Satellite Radio and they're coming  in here to talk to us for some reason.  And none of us have seen The Apprentice.  Oh, I know exactly who they are.  Because it's a bunch of crap, that show.  No, it's not.  Elizabeth, Ivana, and Stacey, they're very good.  You have no clue who these people are.  Not true at all.  I definitely know Elizabeth was eliminated in the fifth week, I remember. 
[02:05:30]  It was a whole big thing.  It's written here on the sheet.  I didn't even see the sheet.  I didn't even see it.  The only reason you know something about them is because you want to live in the Trump  building.  No, I'm not going to.  I'm never going to live in the Trump building.  He doesn't know anything about them.  No, I know he doesn't.  All right.  Who doesn't want to live in the Trump building?  It's everyone's dream.  Every little boy's dream is to live next door to Kiss.  Can they knock on your door?  All right, and we're going to step aside here.  Wait, wait, wait.  Someone was requesting the Donna Summer call.  I don't think we've played it on the new radio show.  That's an oldie. 
[02:06:00]  Oldie but goodie.  A lady called us, which would be the wrong radio station.  Yeah, we had a number that was close to one of the other radio stations in town, and  we used to get wrong numbers from these people all the time.  And they'd be like, what did I win?  And we'd go right into a wacky DJ mode.  Right.  So this girl or lady thought she was winning Donna Summer tickets.  Am I the right caller?  What were you calling for?  Um, Donna Summer tickets.  Donna Summer tickets.  Are you a big Donna Summer's fan? 
[02:06:30]  Yes, but I'm more of a .5 fan.  Oh, boy.  Here we go.  She knows the right things to say.  Here we go.  Let me tell you something.  Mm-hmm.  You're going to see Donna Summer.  You're kidding.  Congratulations.  Thank you.  Matter of fact, we're going to put you in the front row.  What do you say?  For Donna Summer.  What do you say?  I don't believe it.  Thank you very much.  Congratulations.  Thank you.  Hey, what color panties are you wearing?  I'm wearing a bathing suit.  Donna Summer wants to know.  What kind of bathing suit are you wearing? 
[02:07:00]  A one-piece?  A thong?  Bikini?  A bikini.  I'm sun tanning.  Sun tanning.  Sun tanning.  And then by my pool is my radio with .5 on.  Oh, boy.  She says it again.  Look at that.  Since she's mentioned the station so many times, I think another prize is in order.  You like the disco era?  Yes, I do.  The whole disco dancing thing?  Absolutely.  How about a disco weekend in Las Vegas, Nevada?  Yeah!  That's right.  You'll be whisked away to Las Vegas, Nevada to see Donna Summer in Las Vegas. 
[02:07:30]  Are you serious?  We are serious.  I can't believe this.  You just have to tell us one thing.  What?  What's the strangest object you've ever used during sex?  The what?  Donna wants to know.  Nothing!  You're a virgin.  No!  You're a big fat virgin.  Yeah!  You're a big fat virgin.  And what's your favorite station?  0.5.  She said it again!  Yeah!  You know what you're going to win now? 
[02:08:00]  What?  A trip on the space shuttle.  Yeah!  The first person in space.  You're going to see Donna Summer on the space shuttle.  Isn't this fantastic?  Oh, this is wonderful.  Have you ever been on the space shuttle?  No, I haven't.  Have you?  Oh, it's beautiful.  Yes!  Fantastic.  It's going to have a big disco ball.  Mm-hmm.  They're going to decorate it all.  Hey, do you know how to dial a phone?  Yes.  What's your favorite sexual position? 
[02:08:30]  Hello?  Donna wants to know.  Hello?  Oh, no.  Did she hang up finally?  She's gone.  Oh, my God.  It took forever.  It's time, it's time, it's time to find, to find, to find America's sexy, sexy, sexy, sexy.  Let's hear it from Pennsylvania.  Oh, God.  Oh, God. 
[02:09:00]  Oh, God.  Oh, God.  Oh, look at that.  Oh.  This is a hard movie.  Oh, it's flipping me over.  Oh, grab my hand.  Grab my hand. 
[02:09:30]  Think you can do better?  Call O.P. and Anthony live at 866-WOW-1-WOW  and give it your best shot.  Oh, stick it in my hand.  Whoa, hey, that's something you don't hear every day.

It's the Big Ten Today on XM Satellite Radio.  It's Wednesday, December 15, 2004.  I'm Maggie Lenton with your Big Ten Today.  Big Ten!  Michigan proudly stands with a winning record, 
[02:11:00]  despite having massive injuries,  including the loss of three starters.  Coach Tommy Amaker says the desire and hard play of walk-ons is making the difference.  Well, you know, they wouldn't be on our team if we didn't think that they were quality people  and quality players.  And, you know, we've mentioned that to our players.  You know, I mean, it's not a charity situation that, you know,  to be on the basketball team and be a part of our program.  And so, you know, they've earned that.  And, you know, they're obviously maybe not of the level of some of the other players, 
[02:11:30]  but they know that.  But, you know, they make up for it in a lot of different ways.  And so sometimes when you have the hustle and the desire and the work ethic  and, you know, just the attitude and the spirit about wearing a Michigan uniform,  you know, you'd be surprised how much you can make up for sometimes with lack of talent  or in areas of that sort.  So those kids have done that.  And I think that's why we've been able to still win a couple ballgames.  The Wolverines' leading scorer, Lester Abram, is lost for the season with a shoulder injury. 
[02:12:00]  Coach Amaker was asked when he would be operated on.  We're trying to make sure that, you know, his exam schedule and papers and things  that he has to complete, you know, is going to do it at the conclusion of that schedule.  And there's still a few things that he's trying to iron out as the time frame  of some of his academic course load.  But as soon as that's completed and he gives them an opportunity to figure out one  we can tie in a date.  And right now I think it's looking like it could be, I want to say, the 16th of December, 
[02:12:30]  but I hope we could have done that.  Michigan plays at UCLA on Saturday.  And that's the Big Ten today on XM Satellite Radio.  Big Ten!  Big Ten!  Oh!

[02:14:30]  stopping by to say hi.  Who's the lovely young lady out there now?  She's a friend of Yoshi.  She's a comic.  And she brought porno.  Oh, did she bring porno?  I think so, right?  Is that what that is?  What's that?  What's in the old basket there, Eric?  It's a gift from our friends at Caroline's.  Oh, nice.  Oh, ho, ho.  Open that up.  Wow.  Rob from Hicksville.  What's up?  They hook us up with a night at their club for free to see Brian Regan and then they send 
[02:15:00]  a basket.  Yeah, they're just amazing.  Caroline's knows exactly what they're doing.  They're the best.  Yes, definitely.  Rob, what's up?  Hey, guys.  I just wanted to give you guys a rundown on who you have coming on the show.  Okay.  We got Elizabeth, Ivana, and Stacey R. Go ahead.  Okay.  First, you got to ask Ivana about, she strips the stuff.  She's what?  She strips the stuff.  On the show, she tried to get her team to win by stripping, and it didn't work. 
[02:15:30]  She strips?  Yeah.  Oh, okay.  Maybe she's a little more loose.  All right.  Not as uptight.  Elizabeth, she's really hot.  She's kind of flaky, but she's pretty cool.  Okay.  That's really going to help us, by the way.  Thank you.  Hold on.  You know, I'm getting there.  She's hot, but flaky.  All right.  Hot, but flaky.  Yeah.  Okay.  Stacey R., play the C word alert.  Oh, really?  Oh, boy.  Why?  Oh, big time C.  Oh, we'll call her a bitch. 
[02:16:00]  All right.  Oh, okay.  So we got a bitch, a girl that likes to strip, and someone who's hot but flaky.  Right?  Yeah.  Yep.  Why the hell are we talking to these girls today?  I don't know.  Ben was like, no, we got to talk to them.  We got to talk to them.  What the hell is this stuff?  I'm having a chocolate ginger snap cookie that's, like, so goddamn good.  It's actually from the...  It's out of this world.  It is out of this world.  It's from the most top-of-the-line place in New York. 
[02:16:30]  It's from Zabar's.  Licorice.  That's cool.  Very nice.  What is this stuff?  Marshmallow-y stuff?  Those are for you.  All right.  They sent those special.  Gee, thanks.  There you go.  Okay.  A few other things to get to today.  Can I have one of those, Anthony?  Chocolate.  Oh, boy.  Hot chocolate mix.  That is a good cookie.  Go grab some.  Thanks.  A couple things.  Anna Kornikova.  Very, very sad day.  Very, very sad day. 
[02:17:00]  Thanks, buddy.  She got married.  Married?  Anna Kornikova.  Who'd she marry?  She has fat camel toe.  I love her.  She married Enrique Iglesias.  She did.  Iglesias, yes.  Enrique Iglesias?  Yeah.  They've been dating for a long time now.  Oh, she was in his video.  Right.  And it was all steamy.  Man.  Pretty hot video.  Well, she's done.  She's married.  Yes, she's got a very puffy vag, we call it here on the show. 
[02:17:30]  Whenever she was wearing those little tight shorts, when she was playing tennis badly,  she would stuff the balls in the side of her shorts.  Yeah.  And you'd see her camel toe, very puffy, very nice.  Now she's out of the hunt, huh?  Yeah.  And we're all depressed.  Yeah.  Like we all had a shot.  Well, you like to think.  Oh, stop it.  You like to think if the planets align the right way and there's enough drugs involved. 
[02:18:00]  That if you hooked up at a party or something and started talking.  If she'd just get to know me, I know I'd have a shot.  Well, it happens all the time.  No, it doesn't.  When?  It happens with Enrique Iglesias.  What about Rachel Hunter?  She was banging some DJs for a while, right?  See, it happens.  Oh, yeah, definitely.  After Rod Stewart, though?  Oh, no.  Yeah, no.  Before Rod Stewart.  Oh, no.  After Rod Stewart.  Yeah, after.  After Rod Stewart ruined her.  Rod Stewart.  All right, time out, dude.  Goes around and ruins women. 
[02:18:30]  Just ruins.  Puts 20,000 or 200,000 miles on them and then drops them off at the junkyard.  You're insane.  For the rest of society.  Rachel Hunter is still smoking.  Smoking.  Dude, smoking.  She knocked herself back into some passable shape, but she's nowhere near what she was.  Smoking.  That video, that MILF video.  Stacy's mom.  Yeah, Stacy's mom.  I'm telling you, she's still happening.  Nowhere near pre-Rod.  And now she's on that Gilligan's Island stupid show that I took a peek at.  She puffed up like crazy after she had the cake. 
[02:19:00]  Dude, she is so hot still.  Well, I tell you, she worked herself back into shape, but nowhere near pre-Rod.  Rod sucks the life out of women.  He's like a Twilight Zone episode.  Goes out with them, kind of gets a little of their youth or something, and then throws  them to the wayside.  We're way off on this one.  I am not.  Way off.  You say she's as hot as she was pre-Rod.  She's still extremely hot and very doable.  Yes.  There were those photos.  The photos, was she in Penthouse or Playboy a couple years ago?  Yeah.  Yeah, she still looked pretty good. 
[02:19:30]  She was a cute type thing.  Someone get the pictures of Rachel Hunter and Playboy, and you tell me that she's lost  a lot.  I think she has.  I think Rod sucked it right out of her.  Wow, man.  Yep.  She's been around a while, too.  That's what I think.  He's another genius that keeps getting married, too.  How many times has he been married?  Yeah.  Wasn't he singing that song where he started to cry about Rachel Hunter?  Wasn't that it?  He's terrible.  And then, oh, Jolly Good, move on.  Yeah, but I mean, look at the chicks the guy's nailed. 
[02:20:00]  I mean, he's done pretty well.  He's always trading in for a new 22-year-old.  I must say, yeah.  I mean, he's old.  Rod's kind of putting the bag of a bass player into his mouth.  His, um, Rod, what's it?  Rod Stewart.  Shit, yeah.  His stuff is terrible.  We're having a party.  It makes me, it hurts my back.  That song is so awful.  I hate Rod Stewart.  What about Maggie Mae?  It stinks.  Maggie Mae was not a bad song.  It was horrendous.  As far as a pop song goes.  Stay with me. 
[02:20:30]  Wake up, Lacey.  I think I got a boat ride.  Take you on.  No.  Actually, yeah.  Yeah.  You know?  Do You Think I'm Sexy would have been a better example.  That was a good song at one point.  Stop it.  In the 70s, it was okay.  You're picking that one?  You're picking that one over Maggie Mae?  Yes.  Yeah, Maggie Mae, of all the songs, I could tolerate.  But that's the one you hear Ad Nauseam on classic rock.  Yeah.  You think this one's not that bad.  Woo!  Tippi Tomm song. 
[02:21:00]  Yeah.  Go ahead.  There you go, Jazzy Beat.  Jim also, didn't you like the Village People too?  Yes.  Here comes the Disco Synthesizer.  I saw them in concert.  Listen to that crap.  Disco Rod.  When was this?  70s, right?  Yeah.  76, maybe?  77, I don't know.  Sounds about right. 
[02:21:30]  I just feel like being in Studio 54, snorting some cocaine.  Getting head from a nice young busboy.  What a monster hit this was back then.  God, Jesus Christ.  This video, I mean, there was a really young girl.  Remember the video?  The girl looked like she was like 12 in it. 
[02:22:00]  Rod was like chasing her.  Probably dating her.  Alan Alda.  Alan Alda did this song too?  I'm sorry, he's on NBC.  I think I could just...  A lot of few people I'm dying to meet that I can't get near.  And we care why?  No one says you have to care.  We're on a radio show.  You just talk.  Eric in Colorado.  What's up, Eric?  Hey, guys.  Man, you were way off on Rachel Hunter.  She was just in Playboy like two months ago.  All right, let's find the pictures.  I got to show Anthony the pictures of Rachel.  Rachel Hunter and Playboy, and you're telling me she's not hot anymore.  Oh, my God damn it.  She is fucking gorgeous. 
[02:22:30]  Exactly.  In fact, the current issue, Denise Richards is in.  She's even better.  Yeah, I don't know.  I think Charlie Sheen's sucking the life out of her.  Denise Richards...  I'd like to suck some life out of her, too.  Denise Richards became creepy.  She has the kids, and then only a few months later, she's in Playboy.  You know what?  I'm trying to prove her.  She's trying to prove something.  I don't know what she's trying to prove, but...  She can look really weird and then really hot in certain pictures.  Let me take a look.  She turned us down, by the way, Denise Richards.  Really?  Why?  I'll tell you what. 
[02:23:00]  I wouldn't mind sucking some life out of either one of them.  And she's taking her clothes off in Playboy.  She has no business turning our radio show down.  Why'd she turn us down?  She has the same publicist as Carmen Electra, and you remember when Carmen came on at A&W?  Did she?  Yeah.  We didn't do a bad job with Carmen Electra.  There was nothing that her publicist was...  All right, these pictures are from MrSkin.com.  How old are they?  These might be older than the Playboy photos.  I'm looking at a midsection here that no way had a kid in it.  No, this is 98, Anthony. 
[02:23:30]  Yeah.  So this isn't fair.  I mean, she obviously was hotter in 98.  I want the current pictures from Playboy.  And then you tell me if she's not hot.  What does she do, Rachel Hunter?  She just bangs people.  She has sex with rock stars.  Is she an actress?  Apparently.  She has sex with rock stars and DJs.  She was a supermodel many years ago.  You bang her?  Huh?  You banged her?  Yeah, what DJ was she having sex with?  I'm saying DJs.  That's how we got started on this whole thing.  It was like any of us would have a shot at Anna Kornikova, and Opie's saying that we would  have had a shot with Rachel Hunter because she banged DJs. 
[02:24:00]  Did she bang Greaseman?  Waterdoodle, Rachel Hunter.  Scott Farrell.  I know of a DJ that banged Rachel Hunter.  Who?  Brother Wheeze?  Was it Don or Mike?  Yeah, I was banging Rachel Hunter.  I had to put more oxygen up my nose because she sucked the life out of me, baby.  With my big fat cowboy hat.  I was banging her my skinny old Imus ass pumping up and down on her.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  No, nothing. 
[02:24:30]  Yeah, you had something.  You had something there.  Maria, what's up?  Hey.  Oh, I know who she banged.  Who?  Spuds Buckley.  Who's that?  Maria.  Hi, Maria.  Where are you calling from?  Thanks for calling the program.  What's up?  Maria, help us out here.  Everyone knows the show is mediocre at best today.  Yeah, we stink today.  Let's go.  What? 
[02:25:00]  Maria, what do you have for the show?  Well, that guy called up before about Stacey R from The Apprentice.  Stacey R from The Apprentice who's making an appearance on the show today.  We could give a shit.  Well, he described her as a big C.  What?  He described her as a big C.  Who did?  Well, the last caller, sure.  Yeah.  Doesn't even start.  Like, good friggin' luck today with her.  Really? 
[02:25:30]  Okay.  Yeah, thank you, Anthony.  All right.  So she's a real bitch, huh?  Yeah.  That's her character.  No.  She's the witchy one.  Like, stay out of her way.  Well, this whole thing's been a soap opera for about a week.  I've been getting updates from, do we call him the Birdman?  The Birdman.  Eric the Birdman, he had to deal with her off and on for the last week.  Norton put it all in perspective.  He said, they're game show contestants. 
[02:26:00]  That's the new celebrity because of reality shows.  He says all that, but he still wants to get his photo with him.  So what if Stalin walked in, I'd say, you know, hi, can I have a picture with you?  You'd be a great shot to have.  Yeah, dude, you know me.  But I make no bones about it.  I don't, I warm up for a second.  No bones about it by gum.  I know, yeah.  Forgive my, pardon my French, ladies.  How old are you?  I really have no bones about it.  Now, where are the pictures from Playboy?  Still working on those?  Ben Ope wants the pictures from Playboy.  Oh, we can't get, uh. 
[02:26:30]  We already mentioned that she's on the new Gilligan Island show and she looks hot there.  What's the new Gilligan Island show?  Gilligan's Island show, I said.  What is it?  What is it?  They ran out of reality show ideas is pretty much what that is.  What the hell is that show?  They dress people up like Gilligan and the Skipper and the rest of them?  And Rachel Hunter is like Ginger, you know?  Yeah.  They're all characters and I don't know.  Oh, I didn't think celebrities were involved in that.  I thought they just got regular people.  Well, Rachel, yeah.  But Rachel Hunter is playing like a character?  Yeah, like Ginger. 
[02:27:00]  Jesus Christ.  Her career has plummeted.  I just watched it because I'm really into her.  I think she's still really hot.  Yeah.  So I checked it out for a little while.  Jay in Philly, what's up?  Yeah, what's going on, guys?  Hey.  Hey.  Dude, you're sitting there saying Rachel Hunter is hot.  She's hot as hell.  She was in the MTV video, Stacy's Mom.  It was the video at the end.  A little kid punching his clown door because he was mowing the grass, staring at her the  whole time sunbathing.  Yeah.  The kid jerks off to her at the end of the video.  She's so hot. 
[02:27:30]  All I know is I saw a picture of her and it was after she had the kid and she was still  with Rod and she looked, she had really puffed up, she was fat, she had a big double chin  and it was one of those star pictures, out of the star.  So she really, you know, they get her in the worst light.  She had no makeup on, a little disheveled, maybe taking out the garbage.  All right.  And she looked like crap.  We'll find the Playboy pictures and then we'll get your opinion, all right? 
[02:28:00]  What?  The giggles.  Did you just fart again?  No, I didn't.  I'm waiting.  I know.  Anytime Jim starts laughing, I start going, uh-oh.  No, I did not.  You're going to fart in front of the Apprentice Girls, aren't you?  Please.  Whatever you have inside you, just hold it, hold it, hold it, okay?  That's what he's laughing about.  It's simmering in there like soup.  It's like stew.  Are you just holding a real good one?  I feel like geologists are looking at my colon, realizing something's going to happen soon. 
[02:28:30]  We see a fault line here.  All right, that's classic.  An eruption is imminent.  Oh, they're going to hate it.  Because I dropped one before and Ben blasted it and it still reeked through the Lysol.  It reeked.  Oh.  I'm saving it, too.  You're going to put your puffy coat on your Terminator glasses like you do on the elevator.  All right, listen.  More celebrity news.  Yes.  Joe Simpson, Ashley, and Jessica's pop. 
[02:29:00]  Oh, the dad?  Yes.  Doesn't shy away from talking about his offspring's physical assets, Anthony.  Listen to what he has to say about Jessica.  All right.  Jessica never tries to be sexy, Simpson tells GQ.  She just is sexy.  If you put her in a t-shirt or you put her in a bustier, she's sexy in both.  She's got double Ds.  What are you doing over there?  You can't handle it.  I'm just giggling. 
[02:29:30]  I know.  Your stomach is bloated with gas right now.  It's going to be so bad.  You've got to hold it in.  I know you want to let it out.  Please hold it.  He's turning red.  I know.  He's turning red and laughing so hard.  You're going to laugh too hard and it's going to come out.  It's going to come out more anyway.  It's going to ruin us all.  So Pops is talking about Jessica's boobs.  Basically saying how sexy she is.  She doesn't have to try to be sexy.  Why is the father talking about her titties?  And then he brags she's got double Ds. 
[02:30:00]  The father said that.  Yeah.  And then he says, you can't cover those suckers up.  Oh.  So he's noticing.  Mm-hmm.  That's a little creepy.  Not as creepy as Lindsay Lohan's dad, but pretty goddamn creepy.  Hey, bud.  Oh, we've got the Gilligan show premise.  Chris in Mississippi.  The first call from Mississippi.  What's up, Chris?  Hey, I was just going to call and let you know why Rachel Hunter is on the real Gilligan's 
[02:30:30]  Island.  Oh, okay.  Basically what it is is they've got real skippers, real first mates, real millionaires, and she's  the real actress.  That's why she's playing Ginger.  Oh.  There you go.  Now it makes sense.  Hopefully they'll have real cannibals.  She's hot, so that's why I watch.  Real spears.  Yeah, she's definitely hot.  I don't know what Ann's getting at with it.  I'm sorry.  I was going to say, I have seen the Playboy pictures, and she's still hot. 
[02:31:00]  I don't know.  Is it Norton saying she's not hot?  No, I don't really know much about her.  It's Anthony saying she's hot.  I was saying that Rod Stewart kind of ruined her.  Well, no.  I think the thing I like about seeing her on TV is you get to see her talk, and you hear  her.  She's not stupid.  You'd think all stupid supermodels are, but she's not stupid.  I don't care if she's stupid or smart.  She's just freaking hot.  She's the stalker from Mississippi.  Yeah, it's great.  You know when you're pinning her down and duct taping her mouth?  Exactly.  She really does seem sincere. 
[02:31:30]  She yells out, pie squared, before you put it in her dumper.  All right, Chris.  Thank you.  All right, guys.  I appreciate it.  I love the show.  I'm a new subscriber.  Thank you, Chris.  Enough about Rachel Hunter.  If we get the Playboy pictures, we'll go back to it.  So get rid of those phone calls, please.  In other celebrity news, one more thing that is really creepy and kind of depressing,  I've got to tell you.  Jim Norton?  Well, yeah, without saying.  I'm a celebrity.  But it's someone we've had a lot of contact with over the years, and we really, really  like her. 
[02:32:00]  Her?  Okay.  Her or him.  What?  We're talking about Chyna.  Oh!  From the WWE.  Well, she's not in the WWE anymore.  She got kicked out because her ex-boyfriend, Triple H, started seeing the boss's daughter.  And there was like just...  And that was no wrestling bit.  Not at all.  And can I get my copy of that?  I lost mine.  What's the bad news?  That she won't be releasing the porno?  No, it's just creepy because we know her.  She's a cool lady. 
[02:32:30]  And there's a porno out.  One night in China.  Here, just take mine.  Yeah, I need this.  Thank you.  I guess if you're going to put out a porn tape, you've got to have a name that's a city  somewhere around the world or a country.  Well, I guess it's the same company that put out the...  One night in Paris?  Yeah, the Paris Hilton video.  And now it's, yeah, one night in China.  And it's pretty much China, as we all know and love from the WWE.  She hasn't been wrestling for years for Vince. 
[02:33:00]  She's got to call herself Joanie now.  Joanie.  She's not even allowed to use the name China, I guess.  No.  Well, she's been going out with X-Pac for a long time.  And they made a video when they were in China of them pretty much just having sex everywhere.  They were touring Asia, actually.  And they were having sex everywhere.  And they supposedly filmed it for their own enjoyment.  Sure they did.  And somehow it got in the, quote, wrong hands. 
[02:33:30]  And now it's being released, this video.  And we got some stills of China.  Oh, I love her.  Have we put these on the website?  We should.  OBNAnthony.com or FoundryMusic.com.  So they show China just topless and bending over.  And, I don't know, you see her puha.  Ah, puha.  And this is where we have a problem.  Ant and I are like, that is disgusting.  That's a disgusting clit. 
[02:34:00]  And Norton's like, no, that's how I like them.  Yeah.  But it looks like a little peenie.  It's an uncircumcised schween.  Her clit has to be as big as your thumb, right?  And it looks like a miniature peenie.  It's like your ring finger.  Because it's not as fat as a thumb.  It looks pretty big, man.  It's long.  Right.  It's longer than a thumb.  It hangs.  It hangs.  You shouldn't have anything that's hanging like that if you're a girl. 
[02:34:30]  It hangs.  It's got foreskin.  That's just what it is, right?  If you're going down there, you want to go digging for it.  You don't want to poke it out and saying, hey, how are you doing?  Yeah, here I am.  You want it to be a little bit of a surprise, like a buried treasure.  This thing is hanging.  I like a clit.  I can see through snow pants.  But this thing is hanging, man.  It looks more like male stuff than girl stuff.  But all clits are on four pieces.  I understand all that.  I understand all that.  That's why it doesn't bother me. 
[02:35:00]  I could care less.  Yeah, but this thing is a lot bigger than the average one.  That could gag you if you put it in your mouth.  No.  It's just disgusting.  And the lips big?  Huh?  Yeah, the lips are nice and meaty.  Oh, she's got a nice one.  And then they show her giving head.  They show her bent all the way over with X-Pac about to enter, which looks like he's going  for the balloon knot.  Yeah, he's kind of getting some backdoor action there, it looks like.  And in a weird way, it's kind of sad to see Chyna in this light, you know what I mean? 
[02:35:30]  Because she was on top of the world with the whole wrestling thing, and I think her life  has gone bad the last few years, and it's come down to this.  Vince owns everything that made her famous, except, you know, her body.  So what else is she going to do?  What the hell else is she going to do?  Except hardcore pornography.  She can't even use the name Chyna.  Now, Joni says, the video was something that my boyfriend and I take for our own personal  pleasure.  However, when an outside party got hold of it, I decided to make a preemptive strike  and release the video myself. 
[02:36:00]  I'm proud of my performance in the video and feel confident that my fans throughout the  world will love it.  Oh, wait a minute.  She's saying she's releasing it?  An outside party got a hold of it?  Come on, just be honest.  An outside party.  Yeah.  I think she realized what, you know, the porno did for Paris Hilton and what it did for  Pam and Tommy, and I think she's looking for the same kind of recognition with her tape.  This is the new thing to get your name back in the spotlight, you know? 
[02:36:30]  Is that it?  I think so.  Is that what Opie and Anthony show needed?  It was for us to put out a porno tape to get our names back in the...  We tried that.  We did?  But, I don't know.  Audio.  I guess Steve will put the stills up on foundrymusic.com or opiananthi.com, but it's just kind of  creepy and disturbing.  It was completely on purpose.  I can't even think that anyone would make a porno tape for your own purpose. 
[02:37:00]  First of all, who does that?  And then let it get into others' hands.  You know?  Mm-hmm.  You ever tape yourself?  Having sex?  Yeah.  Never.  See?  Never.  Jimmy?  No.  No tape?  I've had a couple of pictures of girls giving me head over the years, but it's very rare  I do that.  I don't know why I don't.  A couple of photos.  Yeah.  Smile.  But no video.  No.  Yeah.  What are you going to do with it?  There's a couple I wish I had a video on, though. 
[02:37:30]  I'd whack my bag watching it.  Watching yourself.  Watching them, just like, I can't believe I got that.  There's a couple I look back on, I'm like, God damn, I wish I had tape of that.  Yeah?  Yeah, because it's the girls, you're like, you know, look at them, not me.  My awful body would kill anybody's mood.  All right, Anthony, here's, going back to Rachel Hunter.  All right.  So the China thing, I don't know, One Night in China.  They had to go all the way to China just so they could use the name China, I guess.  There's One Night in China, and it's, you know.  I bet they did, you're right.  Having sex with China, can't use the name. 
[02:38:00]  I know what you're going to say about this picture, but I don't care.  This is Rachel Hunter, recently in Playboy.  Oh, okay.  You know what I'm going to say about it?  Yeah.  And I won't even say it.  I'll let you say it.  No, I know what you're going to say.  They took a photograph of her completely on her back, which definitely helps a world of hurt.  She is on her back.  She is arching her back.  She still looks hot, though.  She has her neck stretched up.  She's got her arms behind her head, and she's pushing her chest out. 
[02:38:30]  You can still see her ribs, though.  She's probably, she's still in good shape.  I know, and it's, I know, that shot is all about making the boobs look good.  It is all about the pose.  You got more pictures of Rachel Hunter?  This is all about the pose, my friend.  All right, here's another one of her on her back.  On her back, arching it like a mad woman, and arms stretched out.  All right, there's a theme here.  Here's the third picture of Rachel Hunter on her back.  On her back, arms again over her head. 
[02:39:00]  I mean, of course, she doesn't look bad at all.  She still has a cute face, looks nice, body isn't bad at all, but it's no pre-rod.  Here's the fourth picture of Rachel Hunter on her back.  What a surprise.  On her back.  Here's Rachel Hunter with her back to the camera, so you don't see the boobs in that shot.  And here's Rachel Hunter sitting up, but arching her back all the way backwards where her head is almost touching the bed. 
[02:39:30]  Oh, my God.  What's wrong with her nip over there?  Here's another picture of Rachel Hunter in a park on a blanket, completely on her back, arching her chest upwards.  There is not one frontal picture of her just standing there.  Here's one frontal picture while she's laying kind of on her belly and kind of arching her head and her chest upwards. 
[02:40:00]  You can see one boob.  But that's a really hot shot because they got a little tape on her mouth.  Not a tape.  Gag.  A little gag action.  A little see-through handkerchief.  Thank you.  Lightly tied around her mouth.  Like I said, not bad.  So maybe the photographers at Playboy are just absolutely brilliant.  And look, they kind of have it blurry around her belly area. 
[02:40:30]  They didn't keep that in focus because, you know, you have kids.  That kind of happens.  No, that looks hot.  I think you're being way too picky with Rachel Hunter.  I admit I am.  I'm being too picky.  You're right.  I am.  Because all I said was, Rod Stewart kind of put some miles on her.  That's it.  How long was he with her?  Too long. 
[02:41:00]  Five years?  No, kind of a while.  A while.  Yeah, he was with her for a while.  How long, Ben?  Two kids together.  Oh, okay.  Yeah.  Okay.  Goes around, has kids with these women.  Listen, I'll say this, Lloyd.  Wrecks him.  I have a friend that banged her, and he said she was pretty hot naked.  One of your friends.  Which is also the DJ.  Did he call you on a...  No, no, no.  Hey, it wasn't Mark Perrano.  Oh, well, that'd be the wrong sex.  Not a chance to help.  Hey, I'll take that Rod Stewart, though.  Hey.  I love those new kids on the block.  Give me those videos. 
[02:41:30]  We know a DJ that banged Rachel Hunter.  No.  And we used to compete against him.  No, no, no.  Don and Mike?  No, no, no, no.  I thought it was Frida.  And if Ben knew him, if he's a friend of Ben's, then it was in Boston.  Nope.  No?  It was Mike and the Mad Dog.  That's right.  Used to compete against him.  It's Francesa.  I can't think of who it could be.  Who did you used to compete against? 
[02:42:00]  We can't say?  Oh, oh.  I think I know.  I won't say that.  We shouldn't say that.  I think I know.  I'll tap there.  Why not?  Dude, if I banged Rachel Hunter, I would be putting up billboards all over New York.  Kane or Cabby, one of those guys from K-Rod?  I know who it is.  Hey, with that said, let's...  I know who it is.  A lot of people want to hear this.  Snoop Doggy Dog.  On K-Rod.  Oops.  Hey, yo, Jim, man.  Why don't you kick some of that, you know?  You know how you do it, man.  It's a trip. 
[02:42:30]  People don't even believe we're together right now.  With Jim Morrison.  But tell your story.  You know the one I like.  Say it for me.  Riders on the storm.  Riders on the storm.

His brain is squirming like a toad.  Big A long holiday.  Let your children play.  If you give this man a ride, sweet family will die. 
[02:45:00]  Killer on the road.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Away.  In India.  Need for speed. 
[02:45:30]  I'm tryin' to take the lead.  Hold on, little homie, for you run into the trees.  I see things that I never would've saw before.  Ayo, Jim.  Let em in.  Let em in.  Open up.  My back tire smokin' up.  The whole street.  And now the police wanna flash their lights.  And chase the dog all night.  But I won't pull over.  Nor give up.  Cause I just don't give up.  Yeah.

She's a big name  They'll be here in about  Ten minutes  We don't want them on the show  How did this happen?  Barbara was coming in  Barbara  We had to send a car for them  And they're only maybe  Four or five blocks away  We've never sent cars  For anybody  That's not true  We sent that fabulous  Limo service by Anthony  There that would never show up  Remember his limo service?  Oh yeah  I thought of that  Like I said  We never sent a car  For anybody  I walked by Town Hall 
[02:53:00]  My glorious night  Remember Town Hall  Back a couple years ago  It was a sold out show  You guys supported me  April 19th  April 18th  They hacked  And it was a fantastic  One of the best shows ever  And I'm waiting for  Had my parents  I said  This was the official limo company  Of the Opie and Anthony program  Back in the day  That's how good we were  With getting cars  Yeah  And my parents took a train in  To see the show  So I'm like  I'm going to get them a limo back  And this was when you were  Just starting to really  Take it to the next level  I mean it was a huge  Sold out show  It was a really big deal  1,400 people 
[02:53:30]  I can't get two spots  At the cellar  On New Year's Eve this year  Only one  But I saw at Town Hall  You invited the whole family  And they took a train in  And then what happened?  Well at the end  I said I'm going to get them  A limo back  And Anthony originally tells me  Well I can't cop you  That's only for Opie and Anthony  And I'm like  Alright you know  I told you guys this back then  And you're like  You know what  We'll just shred him  On the radio  And somebody called him  He's like  I'm sorry about that  He's like  Yeah we'll get you a car  I'm like  I'll tip the guy  He's like  You'll just tip him  I know social etiquette  Yeah  We stood outside for an hour  Waiting for the car  It was a big night  And after the show 
[02:54:00]  He's waiting for the limo  With his parents  Probably even bragging  Hey mom and dad  Special night  I got you something  A little special  Oh man  Your limo should be  Pulling up any moment now  Hour later  Everyone is gone  I'm still hanging with Norton  And he's just livid  And his parents are just  Kind of wondering  What the hell is going on  All embarrassed for their son  Yeah  Tried to be Mr. Big Hollywood  And it's still  Little fat tits  Isn't it  It's still suburban fat tits  Jimmy  Maybe if one limo  Doesn't show up  You could get us another one 
[02:54:30]  You know  Replace it with a limo  That actually shows up  Dr. Phil's limo  Shows up I bet  Yep  Oh what are you doing  Eric  With the codes  I put my code there  You move it  Oh  Maybe we need to play  Jimmy's mom's phone call  For the new listeners  I like to do the whole  Italian thing  I have a song  I'd like to have played  Yeah what  It's my friend  And she's actually  Very good  Oh  You brought a bit  To the program  Wow  I'm very weird about  Hey didn't you bring  Some kind of sexual harassment  Video too  Oh we should get to that 
[02:55:00]  We won't have time today  But it was  Somebody sent me something  That I sent to Ben  Dude have you been  Listening to the show  We could have used that today  I gave it to Ben  I didn't think about it  I got it  Is it written on the list  Where's the list  No it's not on the list  It's not on today  Whoever made this list  I think you're going to be  Looking for work tomorrow morning  I roll with an iron fist  This is just a song  From my friend  Who does like folk  That's dirty  Dirty folk  I like the second song  I had never listened to it  She's my friend  What's her name  You should plug her  Jessica Adolfino  Jessica 
[02:55:30]  I like the second song  Yeah you heard it  Are you trying to have sex  With this girl  Not at all  No  Never  She stayed  When I lived in Jersey  She stayed at our apartment  For like a month  And she was looking for a place  We never kissed  We never did anything  No  Really  You attract to it  No I'm not trying to  I find that hard to believe  Believe me I'm always honest  About that stuff  I'm a pig  So her name is Jessica Adolfino  Yeah  Dirty folk rock  Yes  And the second song is what  It's called Sudden Change  Sudden Change  It sounds serious  Yeah  No it's really deep 
[02:56:00]  The only thing about this  I wish you'd mixed it a little bit better  Because the audio is a little bit  It wasn't done in a studio  Alright let's take a listen  If you meet me on the street  And I seem to be mad or upset  And you're wondering if it was you  Are there something you should not forget  Remember  Or remember  What's the one for a week  I bleed from my vagina  Oh okay 
[02:56:30]  I wonder where that was going  If you're ever feeling sure  About why you're moving as I do  It's strange  And you don't understand  What we're on the side of change  Remember  Or remember  Once a month for a week  She bleeds from her vagina  Girls aren't afraid 
[02:57:00]  We're really, really great  It's just as we  Let's tell me  The sun should make me process  And you don't know  What we go through  So let me try to tell you  Why we attack the way we do  Remember  Remember  Oh remember  Once a month for a week  We bleed from our vagina 
[02:57:30]  Alright Jimmy  I have been humming that  For two days now  You can all kill me  For the fag reference  But  I believe I heard that  And I saw her perform this live  She's got long blonde hair  And plays at the Central Perk  What's the Central Perk?  What the hell is the Central Perk?  See a couple of the 
[02:58:00]  Faggots who watch Friends  In this room  That's what I'm talking about  Oh my god  Friends reference?

I would tell you  At least off the air  I would tell you  The problem is  You can't really understand  I know  I told you that  I'm like the audio  And it's a song parody  Well not a parody  But it's a goof song  So you gotta be able  To hear all the  I know  All the lyrics 
[02:58:30]  All the words  I mean the hook  Is clear as day  Good thing huh  And what does she look like?  She's  Good looking girl  She has brown hair  But she's his boyfriend  She's always had a boyfriend  Yeah  Alright  I would suggest  That she remixes it  I know I told her that  And she's like  Yeah I wasn't done professionally  But I just like  I just like the  Maybe she can come in live  And do it  Ooh  Okay  Very good  There you go  Thanks Hope  Almost nine  One minute  Bringing a little something  To the show there  And I like it  Because it was quick  And to the point  Yes 
[02:59:00]  One minute and forty seconds  Alright so we got Birdman  Back in the studio here  Birdman  So what's going on with the  Man I'm not comfortable  With the Birdman thing  That's terrible  Bird bird bird bird  Bird is not bird  Bird bird bird bird  How about Hotcock?  That's Ben's  Look at Ben  Ben's like  Why is the show so bad today?  Is it because we're all  Just really tired?  Believe me  We know it stinks  Open to the bathroom  He's like  We stink today  Yeah  I'm going to open the window 
[02:59:30]  In the studio  Like Ben does in the bathroom  I didn't do that today  It's too cold today  I didn't do that  Really?  Oh  I'm sorry  That was being the kind  So we found his limit  Twenty degrees  Seventeen degrees  It's a cut off  Alright so what's going on  With the girls from  The Apprentice  They should be here  Any minute  I know but  They just have attitudes  The one girl has  The one girl wouldn't let us  Talk to the other two girls  She was being  What?  Yeah  She wouldn't let us talk  To the other two  That are on the list  Why Hawk?  Because she was  In charge of them  And she was  The one organizing  All of this  Yet she was too busy 
[03:00:00]  To talk to me  About organizing  Any of this  So it went between  Here  Back to D.C.  Back to here  To our lawyers  Back to here  And then finally  As of yesterday  It was confirmed  Hey Wings  What time are they  Getting here?  Be here any minute  Alright  Wings  Alright  And then she wouldn't  Like sign the paperwork  No that was the big hassle  I told them  There's just some basic paperwork  You have to sign  To allow them  In the studio  We're not signing anything  And she's just getting  This whole attitude  So I said  Well then you can't come on  And then she started saying 
[03:00:30]  Well NBC's gonna be  Really pissed at you  And this looks bad for you  I said  We don't work for NBC  We're not trying to do  Anything bad to NBC  And NBC has been  Pissed at us for years  Ever since we got  The girl to flash  Live on the Today Show  And first of all  NBC understands paperwork  Because they make you  Fill out a mini contract  They understand paperwork  Tell someone from NBC  One of your talent  Wants to come on a show  But they refuse to fill out paperwork  Well we're NBC  We stand behind no paperwork  No  No I'm sorry  How  Does she even work for NBC?  She says 
[03:01:00]  I think till Thursday  Once the show's over  And it's done  You're a game show contestant  Wait this is  This year's Apprentice?  Yeah  Now let's not prejudge  They might be very nice  I know  Because now I'm all riled up  But they may be great  She may have been dealing  With some horrible situations  Don't forget  I've done some radio on the road  It's awful  So maybe she's had  Some bad experiences  And is a bit jaded  Fair enough sir  Fair enough  Ben's giggling like an idiot  No Poe hates her too  Poe had to deal with her  On the phone too  I mean everybody's been involved  In this whole disaster  Poe's got the right ta-ta  But the wrong ho-ho 
[03:01:30]  Downhill racer the trucker  What's up downhill racer?  Downhill racer?  See there  You got the phone right  Open?  No  Press the button  Open  Shut up  Downhill racer?  Yes sir  Hey  Hey  You guys keep saying  That you're having  A horrible show  Last week during the free play  You guys said you were doing  The worst show  You had ever done  And I was laughing  So damn hard  About ran off the road  Oh thank you man 
[03:02:00]  Alright  I feel  This show today's great also  I mean you guys  Gotta quit  Put yourself down  I enjoy the programs  When we're just  Bullshitting in here  I do  It's like having a big old family  Over the radio  And before I wear out my welcome  Eject  Eject  Eject  Bye fella  There he goes  Alright he's gone  Another trucker that kept it short  I like that trend  No they're starting to get it  They're starting to get it  Less time on the phone is more gooder  When you're calling this radio show  Opie I'd like to hand out a 
[03:02:30]  I don't know a stupid award  Okay  I hate when this happens  Two killed trooper hurt in highway crash  The driver and passenger of a car  Who were killed after being struck  By a state police cruiser  Were in the middle of interstate 80  With their vehicle's engine and lights off  Authority said  And the trooper comes along  Dark  And slams into Irvin Samuel 60  And Renee Flynn 55 
[03:03:00]  Sitting in the middle of a dark stretch  Of route 80  They were in the car  The guy was out  He was at the window  Talking to the passenger  In the middle of the highway  With the lights and engine off  Because they had had a fender bender  Apparently with another car  Who was smart enough  To pull off onto the side of the road  People are  And sometimes it ends in  Death like this  And sometimes it just ends in  Huge traffic jams  That I want to get out  And take 
[03:03:30]  Take my Eric-like talons  And gouge their eyeballs  Out of their head  Because there's no reason for it  People assume  If you get into a fender bender  That there's some kind of law  That states you can't move your vehicle  So the police can see  That the police have to come  And take measurements of tire tracks  And skid marks  No they don't  There's no fault insurance now  When you have a fender bender  Doesn't matter  Who is doing what  Where  Doesn't matter  Get your fucking cars off the street 
[03:04:00]  So we can drive by  You don't have to sit there in your car  In the middle lane  Waiting for a cop to go  Move your car  Idiot  And then occasionally  We get to thin the herd  With events like this  Where they park their car  In the middle of  Interstate 80  Did the trooper get hurt?  Trooper got hurt  Thank God he didn't get killed  But I just  You see this happen  All the time  Little fender bender  They get a dent  And they sit there  In the middle of the street 
[03:04:30]  Get off the road  Is that Jersey?  Um  I believe it was  Yes  Nolton Township, New Jersey  Because Route 80  Is a dark  Awful  Awful  Empty road  Trenton's pretty dark  Isn't it?  Now Ant  That's not polite  A whole  A whole  Stretch of roadway  Alright  Oh  Where's Route 80?  You sound a little well lit  On radio  Let's say hi to Mike 
[03:05:00]  Hey Mike  Hey how you guys doing today?  Good  How you guys doing?

[03:05:30]  Apprentice girls  Are on the show  I ask the listeners  For serious questions only  Oh serious questions only  Serious questions only  For the fine ladies  From the Apprentice show  That's right  No monkey business  No monkey business  Just serious questions only  From our listeners  That's right  Pick up that phone  No horsing around  We don't want any horseplay  That's right  Just nice serious questions only  Legitimate questions  Right Ope  Legitimate serious questions only  Calling up just for the sake of  I don't know  Tricking them into looking foolish 
[03:06:00]  Right  We don't want that kind of thing  Absolutely not  We want respect and serious inquiries  And those silly Peterson references  Let's wait till tomorrow  Oh there you go  Tom in Jersey  How you doing guys  Hi Tom  Glad you're back  Thanks good to be back Tom  I think you guys should do  Some kind of apprenticeship  For the ladies on the show today  Oh you're bordering on wacky radio  You mean have them do something  For the show 
[03:06:30]  A la The Apprentice  Exactly  Maybe they could go get us coffee  Or maybe I could put on a bad wig  And they could all blow me  For a spot on the show  Yeah Mike  What's up  Hey do me a favor  Don't let these girls  In the studio today  No  Where's Master Paul  Wow  I don't pay Master Paul  Anything in this world  To snap that little  Fucking Stacy  Bitch's neck off 
[03:07:00]  Why you don't like Stacy  Oh she's a little  Control freak  Little  Bitch lawyer  Oh really  Oh yeah  Forget about it  And Ivana  What a stupid chink  Forget about it  Oh Jesus  That's not very nice at all  It's Ivana  When you get that little Stacy  In the studio there  You're going to see  I mean the seeds  Are going to be flying  You know  Just because a guy like this  Doesn't like them  Doesn't give anyone an excuse  To you know  Call up and make references

Yeah, well, they're still calling  Oh, okay  They're calling, we're screening, we're looking for questions, uh, that we could ask the ladies  Serious questions only today, right?  Right, sure  So why don't we, uh, bring them in the studio here  Bring the girls in  What is Gene Simmons calling?  9.30, I think  9.30?  Supposedly, yeah  I thought it was 9  No, no, 9.30  They were 9  What time is Gene Simmons calling?  9.30  9.30?  9.30 for Gene Simmons 
[03:17:30]  She's making her pose just like a picture of Tom-off  Hey, guys  Hi  How are you?  Hey, good, how are you?  We have two mics for three girls, sorry  Alright, we'll share  So you guys could, like, figure out, you know, what's gonna work for you  Half a mic  Half a mic each, right?  So it's, uh, Elizabeth, Stacy  Yes  And Ivana?  Ivana  Ivana, I'm sorry  Ivana  Well, it has the I, IV, I was thinking Ivana  Yeah, yeah  Ivana  And they're from The Apprentice, a show I gotta admit I've never seen  It's okay, you're not the first 
[03:18:00]  No, it's getting, you know, the show is doing great  We've never seen it either, so, so it makes all of us  We're better off if you don't watch the show  I didn't watch last week  What season is it?  Is this the first, this is the second season?  Second season  Second season  And all three have been, uh, fired  You guys all got voted?  Almost 16 people at this point have been fired  How many are left?  Almost 16, 15 and a half  Was Donald nice to you?  No  No?  Is he a dick?  I wouldn't go that far  I met him once, he was really mean to me  I asked for a picture  We don't talk about Donald's dick  Why? 
[03:18:30]  Ooh  Wow  I kinda like that  Out of the gate, I like that  Naughty  Very naughty  We're not going down that path, Lizbeth  He was very mean to me when I met him  So I was wondering if he was mean to you  He's just a caricature of himself  He's just like the most extreme form of him  Everything is, that's what I think  I think everything is exaggerated  Okay  And that's what makes, that's what makes great TV  Yeah, he's the biggest and the best  Yeah  And everything is the most  In the industry  In the industry  And the best  Are we still talking about his dick? 
[03:19:00]  Are you all lawyers?  All of you lawyers?  No  No  No, Stacy's a lawyer, right?  Yes  And what did you guys do before The Apprentice?  I own my own marketing consulting firm  Wow  What do you market?  Mostly consumer products  Very good  I spent the last five years in venture capital  Investing in technology  Oh my god, we got smart girls  That's the only reason why I invite these ladies in  We're not used to having smart girls in the studio  Usually when we ask that question  We don't get answers like that  No, we don't  I've been stripping for five years  What is venture capital?  What is that? 
[03:19:30]  We provide capital for startups  So if an entrepreneur has an idea  We sort of evaluate the idea  See if it's going to be a big opportunity  And then, you know, if it works  You'll invest in it?  Give them money  Yeah, give them money  And didn't you graduate like top of your class too  In your MBA program?  She's pointing to me, Elizabeth  Yeah  Yeah, I graduated top of my class  I didn't think she was talking to Jim Norton  I dropped out, you know  Suicide attempt in high school  Uh-huh, LOL  They think you're kidding  Ouch 
[03:20:00]  You want to see the scars on his arm?  Elizabeth, you got the boot first  Oh no, Stacy did  Why did they kick you off?  I know he fires people  That's the big thing  But I've never seen the shows  Why did he throw you off?  I think he was just looking for someone to take a risk  And I was not going to go out there  And just blatantly disregard  What my project manager was doing  I mean, my project manager was slacking  He wasn't really doing much  And I just kept complaining about it  They didn't like that  No, but at the end  You were like  I would love the opportunity to be a PM  Like, you were like  I will step up to the plate  Give me the opportunity to do that  Yeah, I did that 
[03:20:30]  But it was too little too late  Whatever, I got to go party for a month afterwards  That sounds like our Washington meetings  Yeah  It's like corporate talk  I'm not used to listening  PMs and  I'm not used to listening to smart girls talk  Oh, project manager  PM, it's the same thing  Sorry, sorry  Abbreviation  Can you dumb it down for us and our listeners?  They might be a little too smart for our audience  And who was your project manager?  It was, that time it was Wes  And that's another contestant  Yeah  Yeah  And then he's like your boss or something? 
[03:21:00]  Basically the way it works is that one person on each team is nominated to lead the task  And they dole out orders  And people are supposed to follow them  And whether or not they follow them, it's up to them  Bless you  Don't mind him, a little hepatitis  Because then might  And basically if you  The team that wins gets a prize  And the team that loses goes to the boardroom  And one person's fired at the end  Right, okay  So the winning team doesn't have to worry about getting thrown off  Exactly  Like the immunity idol 
[03:21:30]  They all basically, come on  All basically have the same angle going, you know  It's true  It's like Survivor or something, yeah  Yeah, the only difference this season was  Last season they didn't have exemption  Which is like immunity from Survivor  So this season it was different  Because if you won  Then the project manager would have exemption  Which is just immunity  I gotta ask a question too  When you win, you get the job  Right, that's basically you guys are fighting  Now the guy that won last year  How much money does the job pay?  Was it a guy who won?  Yeah, yeah  We don't know his name 
[03:22:00]  We don't want him  I know, I love it  But it's good that you assumed it was a guy  I'll tell you how  No, no, no, no, no  Hold on there, Gloria Allred  I actually  I saw him  And the same day that Trump blew me off  They said that's the guy that won last year  So they saw him pointing it out to me  Backpedal, backpedal  No, at the Trump roast  I was there  I mean, I'm a very popular friend  But I wanted to know  What kind of pay  Is it a high paying job?  Or is it  What is it?  100 grand a year?  200 grand a year?  250  And for a lot of people in this group  It's a pay cut  Really?  Oh, really?  Yeah  You guys making a lot of cash? 
[03:22:30]  Some people  Nice  Some people?  Yeah  I think his name was her  For her it's a pay cut  No, but I mean  There are people who have been practicing for five years  There are people who have been out in the work world  You're a lawyer?  Yes, I'm an attorney  You're an attorney  You went through everything  And you've practiced law  Yes, I'm currently practicing  Currently practicing law  What kind of law?  I do corporate work  I work on hedge funds  Oof  Hedge funds  Bottom line is don't argue with Stacey  I guess not  Don't argue with any of these girls, actually  I was on the phone with someone the other day 
[03:23:00]  And they're like  Oh, you can't argue with an apprentice, can you?  That's really the bottom line  So hedge funds  Those are the guys that kind of  I don't know what they do  But I know they make out  I just know hedge fund people make a lot of money  A lot of money  We know nothing  I know  Hedge fund, you sell bushes?  I really am stupid  Uneducated boob I am  And then who got kicked off next?  Elizabeth?  Yeah  That was me  And why did you get kicked off?  I had a mutiny on my hands  A mutiny?  Yeah  The team decided to kind of conspire  And not do what we needed to do for the task 
[03:23:30]  And since I was the odd one out, I got fired  Were you the project manager?  I was the project manager  Now how'd you get that?  Huh?  How'd you get that job?  Picked it out of a hat, I think, that time  Oh, I thought maybe it was based on skills or something  No  No?  No, but it was actually a marketing task  Which is kind of what I do  So it was a cool task for me, anyway  And was your team up for the challenge or no?  Well, you could ask Ivana  She was on my team  Oh, Ivana, you were one of the ones that kicked her off?  She was one of the ones that conspired against me  Well, to be fair 
[03:24:00]  Chris Ariso, who's another contestant on the show  And I  Were strongly opposed to doing the coup  But there is  It was split  It was sort of an interesting episode  Because we had all these characters  See, I don't know this  Because I wasn't there, obviously  Yeah  They were doing it  We had all these characters on our team  And Raj, who is another character  I'm sorry, contestant on the show  He's very into the military  And he thinks he's a general 
[03:24:30]  He thinks he's living in the 1800s  Like in Civil War times  And so he's like  Napoleon's his idol  Yeah, exactly  And so the guy is like  Forget this!  We're staging a coup!  And he just, you know  Was like  This plan of attack came on the whiteboard  You know, he erased everything  That Elizabeth had written down  And was like  We're doing this  So yeah, it was pretty  Dramatic  But at that point  It didn't really  I mean, you know  It's about getting the next person fired  It was less about  Getting the marketing right  Than it was about  Kind of who to  Is this what your radio show  Would be like  If you had one? 
[03:25:00]  Because I heard you girls  Want it like a radio show?  Are we right to hear this?  No, we were talking about  Different  We were talking about  Different topics, actually  Really?  For the radio show  Like what?  Oh, I have a question too  I want to ask one question  Before you  Go ahead, Jimmy  Who was the one that got fired  For saying something like  Anti-Semitic or whatever?  Jennifer  Oh, Gen C  Gen C  She'll never work in New York again  I don't think  Oh, Bo  Was she like  It's a fact  She needs to move  Was she like a real  Was she a creep  Or was she just nice  Who got misquoted?  It depends on who you ask  Well, the C 
[03:25:30]  Is from her last name, Jimmy  Define creep  Yeah  Well, you guys dealt with her, right?  You were on the show with her  Yes  She is a difficult person  What'd she do?  Okay  Look, I feel really bad  That she got fired  From her real job  After the fact  That's unfortunate  It's unfortunate  But you know what?  You have to pay attention  To what you say  That's true  The whole world's watching  And if you make one wrong move  In the wrong direction  You're screwed  You're gonna pay for it  You're gonna pay for it  That's true  What did she say?  She said something like  Cheap Jewish women  Something bad  Basically the task was 
[03:26:00]  To start up a restaurant  And our first customers  Were these two women  I don't know if they were Jewish  I'm Jewish  I don't know if they were Jewish  There were no identifiable features  I mean  They weren't wearing a big star  It was Friday  It was Shabbat  Okay  Yeah  I mean  You really don't  We don't know  But anyway  She identified them  In her mind as Jewish  And she called these  She said that they were  Cheap Jewish women  Fat  Fat  She said cheap too  Like New York Jewish women  Or something like that  Cheap fat New York Jewish women  Mel Gibson should be applauded  Or something really  Yeah 
[03:26:30]  Well  She could go work for him  But to be fair  The episode had blown that statement  Out of proportion  Because it wasn't central  I agree with that  To our discussion in the boardroom  Yeah it seems like editing  Is really handy with reality shows  Like they edit a lot of stuff  To make it look like you said stuff  And had a little more meaning  To what you said  Than you really meant  It never came up in the boardroom  It's true  I mean I never brought it up  The conversation lasted like three minutes  We really didn't understand  What was exactly said  Until they showed it on TV  But then you watched the episode 
[03:27:00]  And it sounds like we're fighting about it  For like 15 minutes  See  Now are there other instances  Where maybe you said something  And then you watched the episode  And go oh my god  That was like a passing thing  Every episode  Yeah  I think the one where  Maria sends me away  Or whatever  Because I'm useless  Was another one  I don't know  It was the fashion task  Useless?  Oh  And she basically  Sends me away  Because  On the show  It appears that she sends me away  Because  I don't know  I'm useless  But in reality 
[03:27:30]  She sent me away  To do interviewing  Of the buyers  Which is what I do for a living  And it was a really important thing  For the task  And it ended up really helping us win  It's so funny  That a lot of the time  People are saying  Well where were you?  You weren't even there  You weren't even doing anything  The whole point  And the fact of the matter  Was that we were always  Divided up into groups  And we were doing other things  Because you can't do everything  All together  Right  Now earlier  I was asking you  What would you do  If you had a radio show  And you're not talking  About The Apprentice  Because I know  That we kind of heard  That you were  Kind of pitching  Some show idea  Well my idea  I mean I was thinking  About this  And I think that  Radio needs something 
[03:28:00]  Fresh and new  Similar to The View  But not quite there  Because I think  That we need something  Younger  Something a little more  Refreshing  Maybe a little sexier  Oh sexier  Let's hear more  So I pitched this idea  Yeah  Well  See look  He's so excited  Sexier than The View  No that's not  Exciting  On Norton's face  I don't know  Because I ordered  This chai  And this is a coffee  Okay  Alright 
[03:28:30]  What do you mean  By sexier  I mean it's  I think that  I'd be more excited  To watch something  Where young women  Are talking about  Their views on dating  And on sex  And on everything  I think  Jimmy  Why is he laughing  So much  What's so funny  You don't like our idea  No no no  I think he may be  Lectious intolerant  I just got nervous  What a dispeakable  Human being  I'm the one 
[03:29:00]  Standing next to him  Oh I'm sorry  Oh no  Someone open the door  I just got nervous  What do you think  Those are four  These girls are so hot  And you just  They are  I'm sorry  You effing farted  Did you hear it  And try to be  Nice  I did  But  There was no  Way to avoid that  It was pretty loud 
[03:29:30]  She was trying to be nice  Jimmy's laughing here  Oh no I just  Alright enough already  Cut it out over there  There's two cans of Lysol  There  Grab it  I have to apologize  He's literally  Shitting on our show  He is an awful  He didn't like the topic  Stacy  Try another one  I'm sorry  I just  Farring in the workplace  Drink more coffee  I just got nervous 
[03:30:00]  I'm sorry  Yvonne is trying to move  As far away from you  As possible  No they're not bad  Actually  They're not bad  The farts aren't bad  No no no  Not at all  Disgusting  So anyway  Really busting the whole room  Full of guys on the radio  Stereotype apart  Aren't you Jim  Sorry  I apologize  Alright so the radio show  Sexier  Yeah  Talking about dating  What else  What else  Any like  It's kind of like  Young fresh hip  Like the view  But the cool thing is  We all have  Business backgrounds  So you're getting 
[03:30:30]  Kind of the  Professional women's opinion  On it  And different backgrounds  Yeah  We don't want to make it  Like all about business  At all  But it's a different spin  On kind of just the  Average chick  That you talk to  Just grabbing out of  Out of your hat  A subject  What would you like  Discuss  Uh well  Kind of could be  A little audition  Kind of thing over here  What do you think  Go for it  Go for it  Well  Well  We've discussed this  Go  Well no  I mean  Well I was going to say  Elizabeth actually 
[03:31:00]  Was written up  In the Enquirer  But we don't  Oh for what  For what  It's got  We gotta be  You know  Fresh about it though  I don't want them  To ask all the questions  Before we do it  Do it  Really  Yeah  Yeah I mean  Just to  What does that mean  What you just said  She's saying that  They don't want to  I don't want to  Like blow our wad  It probably would be  A different  Whoa  Nice  Glad you asked her  To clarify that  It's probably a different  Audience to be very honest  With you  It's okay  Nobody's like listening  Go oh they said  The exact same thing  You know what I mean  It's cool  It wouldn't blow anything  I think one great topic 
[03:31:30]  For example would be like  Sex on the third date  Is it a major mistake  Or major move  In the right direction  Oh I agree  It's a waste  If it doesn't happen  On the first date  That should be the end  Of the relationship  Why third date  I think that's kind of  The unwritten rule of dating  Is it really  Is it really  It's like put out  Or shut up  On the third date  Third date  So first date  Is just kind of  A get to know you  Maybe a kiss at the door  So anyone who wants to call Stacy  Her number is  212-555  What if you go to  Three different places  On the same night 
[03:32:00]  Anything  Does that count  See Norton wants a girlfriend  But he's not going to  Wait around  You're not going to  Wait around  Until the third date  Not necessarily true  I felt like somebody a lot  Especially not  With that flatulence problem  No  I'm going to like that though  Because I think it's open  And cute that I'll do it  I think it's  Cute  You think that's an endearing trait  Is that what you're saying  It's kind of like  A smile or a wink  It shows some vulnerability  And a childlike innocence  Who told you that  That was such an uncomfortable moment  Oh my god  I knew everyone heard it 
[03:32:30]  I feel like I'm hanging out  With my 22 year old brother  No if I like a woman  If I respect her and like her  I don't have to have sex  The first couple days  I hang with her  Why not  How long will you wait  It depends on the person  If I really like somebody  I don't need to try to have sex  So I go out with them  Five times without sex  If I get no vibes at all  I'm not going to waste my time  Five times in a month  Or over how long of a period  It depends on where they live  I work every night  So it's kind of hard  So it's like  If I go out five times in a month  Or a month and a half  And we don't have sex  If I really like them  That's fine  Okay question  Are you paying all five times 
[03:33:00]  I've got to get to  Wait how do you know  He pays for it  We're asking if he pays  I'm assuming to get a girl  To go out with him  Five times  He's paid at least  Once or twice  Get a girl to go out  With him you have to pay  Probably  Will I pay on all the dates  It depends on how much money  She has  I mean if she's somebody  That doesn't make a lot of money  I know I have more  It's like I don't mind  Why not  I don't look at it like  Here I believe  Okay but the question is  Does the money factor  No  Not at all  Influence the sex factor  Not at all  Well I mean most of the time  It does  Most of the time it does  It's a much more direct connection 
[03:33:30]  We avoid the whole dinner  You know  Illusion  He hands her money  At the end of the night  She hands him sex  Not as transactions  No I mean  That's the God's honest truth  Jim likes the ladies of the evening  Yeah I love them  And spends a lot of money on them  A lot of cash  A lot of cash  In a real relationship like that  No I don't care  I don't look at it like  I bought you dinner  Why don't you tell them  What you like girls to do to you  What do you mean  You were all brave  About farting in front of them  I'll tell anybody anything  You know  Some of these ladies come over 
[03:34:00]  And what do they do for you  Just have sex  Regular sex  No no no no  Oh you mean the golden showers  Well where you have to wait  You like that  Yeah  Wow  Occasionally  Not all the time  No no  It's more than  That's a special treat  Ladies it's more than golden showers  No it's not  Tell them about the log dropping  No there's no log dropping  He's like what are you talking  One slips out  No one's looking  You know  You can't embarrass her  Come on brave man  I'm very brave  I'm just telling you  You have no problem farting  In front of the fine young ladies  I'll tell them what you're really into  Tell them how you like  Lay down plastic in your bathtub  I don't lay in the bathtub 
[03:34:30]  I lay in the bathroom  Because you don't want to mess up your tiles  He lays down plastic  He hires a girl to come over  And sometimes she'll squat over his chest  Okay you're so lying right now  Of course he's lying  No no  I wouldn't lie  No you would lie  And other times  You girls need to leave  Whoa  You girls need to leave the studio  Knowing that that's what he does  Yeah  What  I don't believe you  I swear  And they defecate  I want evidence  I want evidence  I don't believe it  See she's the attorney  No I swear  I need proof 
[03:35:00]  That's his thing  Smell his t-shirts  That's one of his things  Stacey you can go over and try it  See what he does  Thanks but no  No I'm a nice guy  It's out of respect  It's not to be a pig  So if you lay down in the plastic  If somebody tinkles on you  If the log comes out  What are you going to do  Embarrass the girl  They're horrible  Who's looking  I'm telling you  It's the truth  It's the truth  It's a pack of lies  It's the truth  That's it  Now is that good on a third date  Dropping a log on a guy's chest  Oh look  Donald's on TV  Gene Simmons 
[03:35:30]  Good morning  Good morning  Are you for or against  Log droppings on your chest  Consenting adults  Sounds like the name of a new band  But I like that  This is Gene Simmons from Kiss  We got three girls from The Apprentice  In the studio as well Gene  Hi Gene  Hi  Hi ladies  And they're trying to do a radio show  So they're coming in and hang with us a little bit today  Oh god  They're in hell aren't they  Yeah because they just found out  That one of our guys likes to get shit on  I see  And they're not really buying it 
[03:36:00]  But I'm telling you it's the truth  He likes to get shit on  And not just by a wife  I see  Right  Well he invites ladies over  And that's one of the things they do for him  Yeah  Do they pay him or does he pay her?  No I have to pay  Really?  Yeah  How much do you have to pay?  Well it depends on the person  I mean I'd say about 300 normally  Someone for  Yeah exactly  Thank you  Thank you for  Is it always just a girl who does it?  Oh yeah I don't bring over teams of animals  Yeah  Sled dogs  Just a chick  No guys do this 
[03:36:30]  Absolutely not  I'm not gay  Okay well then  Look at him  I don't want Gene Simmons thinking I'm gay  He's one of my idols  Gene what do you think of this?  Are you into it?  I'm sorry?  Are you into this?  Not really  I enjoy community sort of activity  Community  Yeah Gene is the Mac Daddy  Yes  He has figured out how not to get married  And how to keep a woman  Even though he's banging other girls  How old are you Gene?  I'm 55  Whoa 
[03:37:00]  I'm 55  How great is that though?  He didn't bullshit or try to hem and haw around  That's why I like this  That's what a rock star is  55  And he'll still have a 20 year old  That's the beauty of Gene Simmons  Yes  Well the way you do it is you add him up  You see  You have two 20 year olds  And then you get a 15 year old  And then it all works out  Oh nice  And then you go to jail  Jesus  I like that  Not if you're in the right country  I like that  Well you get a 25 year old  That is actually true  That if you go around the world  Or even in different states 
[03:37:30]  It's different ages  It's really fascinating  That must look like something  A little pink nail polish  Chewed off of the tips  Running through his gray chest hair  Oh God  I'm really hungry now  Let's get a burger  Love it  Yeah so the girls from The Apprentice  They're going to attempt to do a radio show  I do believe  And why not?  Why not is right  They're very very beautiful too  They've got the gift of God  Thank you  Do you like the band Kiss Girls?  Nope  A little before our time  Nope  Yeah a little before your time  Don't know it  What kind of 
[03:38:00]  You've never heard of Kiss?  You've never heard of Kiss?  Nope never heard of it  You're kidding right?  Yes of course I'm kidding  Everyone knows Kiss  What kind of music do you like girl?  You know I like R&B  R&B  I like music that's not in English  What the hell is that?  That's true  She likes Indian  Yeah she likes  Oh really?  I like Latin  Arabic music  Arabic music?  Yeah have you ever heard of Alabina?  Music that crash planes into buildings by  Yeah jeans  Alright well I don't support that  I'm not saying terrorist music  There's a difference  Well Jean's going ugh on the phone 
[03:38:30]  Good for Jean  Oh god  Jean who do you listen to?  Actually I like the sound of women  Yeah  Good answer  Good answer  Jean's all about getting the pussy  So like Joni Mitchell  No I don't mean musically  Yeah  I mean the music that comes out  We understand  I want to hear what Jean is saying  I'm sorry what's your  Sorry Jean go ahead  I like the music that happens when she's out of control  You should sing in falsetto more often 
[03:39:00]  That's beautiful  With that big Jean  What are the ladies going to be calling the radio show?  Yeah  Oh you got a name for the show you want to have?  Ladies lunch  Fantastic  Ladies lunch  Ladies lunch  Hot lunch  What do you want?  Sounds like a porno movie  And are they doing a satellite show or is it just for regular radio?  They're going to try out for satellite radio  That's right baby  Yeah  Oh well then you've got to have a semi-respectable  You don't want to be like Opie and Anthony  You want to be respectable 
[03:39:30]  Right  We already are  Jean  We always have had fun with you on the show though  I know that but I'm just saying this for the day of the show  You know how much KISS product we have sold for you?  Oh wait a minute  You're trying to make me guilty  This is their radio show not yours  You guys are already doing Opie and Anthony  They can't be second best  Is Dimebag really going to be buried in a KISS coffin?  Well I'm not going to do the jokes because that's a really serious  No no  No we don't  It's not all about the jokes on here 
[03:40:00]  The story came across our  That is true  Wow  The family called the band  And he was a fan  You know he's got the band tattooed on his chest  He was always a sweet upstanding guy  And yes the family has that  And we respected that yes of course  Do you sell a lot of those KISS coffins?  I told you I'm not going to play this game  You know this is too  No he's actually  Gene he's not even busting your balls  He's actually really asking you  No I'm not going down  You know no 
[03:40:30]  I don't know how many of those you're kind of  Actually I don't know  But yes they are out there  Yeah okay  We also played some of the tape from your  What is it?  The seminar  The seminar  The inspiration  Speaking in tongues  Yeah yeah  The lecture tours  Yes and we just love your take on marriage  You want to explain the marriage thing to the girls?  This could be interesting  Yeah please  Actually all women know the game  It's uh  Well here's how you look at it  Scientifically speaking  The biggest cause of divorce 
[03:41:00]  Is marriage  You know how that works out?  And the biggest cause of death is life  I mean  Well you know why men die younger than their wives?  Because they want to  Very nice  The only thing wrong with marriage  One of the two is a man  Yeah  I think unmarried men die earlier than  We don't care  At least we smile  Yeah  I love Gene  Yeah  Just what you want to do 
[03:41:30]  Is to wake up in the morning or at night  And have somebody  Who never earned the right  Ask you where are you going  And where have you been  The only one who ever had the right  Gave me birth  And my mother stopped torturing me years ago  So that's the one part of marriage  Or one of the parts of marriage that you hate  Is the fact that you're going to have to explain yourself  To somebody else  No the only thing wrong with marriage  Is that biologically  It's not a sound idea  Because the male of the species  We're told  Manufactures billions of sperm every day  The female of the species  Only manufactures one egg  Or two eggs per month  Now the only problem is 
[03:42:00]  That ever since we were  Ever since we crawled out of the ooze  We were both created from  You know  At creation  The female of the species  Has actually deluded herself  Into thinking  That all those billions of sperm  Are just for her  Right  So what happens with gay male couples?  Are they just rude?  Gay children play here  I don't understand that  You know  We're talking about  By the way  And gay men  Is a different issue  Than gay women  Two beautiful women together  Is just two beautiful women  Yeah why is that?  Two ugly women together 
[03:42:30]  That's dykes  No but it is true  That our society  I mean it's more acceptable  For women to be  Than for guys  If you go to the jungle  Of Africa  And you see two beautiful chicks  Together they go  Oh that's pretty  I know  I mean for example  I mean they're passing around  This maxim issue  Of the girls of the apprentice  Yeah  And they're all  You know  In these sort of  Underwear  Versidious  Yeah poses  And in lingerie  Because the male of the species  Is visually  Stimulated  You know  When we look at  So  Are you saying  Are you saying  Are you saying 
[03:43:00]  That we're not  Visually stimulated  You're more  Watertight  I would think  Women  No  No I think  That's a definition  Guys have given  No that's actually  I thought  What products sell  Women's products  Typically  How come  Women don't like  Look for guys bulges  Whereas guys  I'm just saying  It's just the way  We look at things  No that's because  We've never shown a bulge  You've been  So bulgry  A lot of babysitters  Of course  Hey guys  No no no  Hey guys  The girls will argue  Until they're blue in the face  But if you look at  The animal kingdom  The opposite is true  The male is full of colors  And all that  And he's put on a display 
[03:43:30]  Of color and size  For the female  So you're supporting  My argument  Gene  There's no reason  In the world  Why breasts have to be  Inflamed like that  That's purely  A show of display  That nature provided  For the male  Because you can make  Just as much milk  If the male animal  Is more beautiful  And colorful  Then that means  That the female animal  Must be the one  That's visually stimulated  That's a nice try  But the animal  Cleaned the meth soul  But not for human beings  National Geographic  Welcome to Discovery  But he's right though 
[03:44:00]  It's not knocking women  But men are more likely  To be visually stimulated  Than women are  More likely  I think you guys  Are brainwashed  No  I totally disagree  Okay  You would  Women do  Because they think  It's like a male arrogance  But it's not  It's just  Well let me ask you  If this is true  And maybe the ladies  Can answer for all women  Because they can speak  For all women  Because Opie Anthony  And myself  Can speak for all men  Get ready for this one  We're ready for the universal  Okay here's the universal answer  And you can say yes or no  Only yes or no  Yes  Women tend to answer in paragraphs  So guys stop them 
[03:44:30]  If they start talking  Alright  I was a child of four  I forgot to clip my toenails  No no  Yes or no  Nothing is ever yes or no  But we'll listen  Well unfortunately  On Opie and Anthony's show  And today it's got to be yes or no  See the way they're doing it  It doesn't have to be  Right away  Gene have you ever been married?  No  Can I ask my point?  No  He's got a great story  Here's how it works  Two guys are talking  And two girls are talking  And one guy says to his friend  Listen I've got a blind date for you  So his friend says  What does she look like?  Okay now two girls are talking 
[03:45:00]  I've got a blind date for you  So her friend says  What does he do?  Okay but you know  That's only because guys are more ugly than women  That starts right away  Blah blah blah blah blah blah blah  Just say yes or no  But he's right  No  If guys were just as gorgeous as women  We would say what does he look like  He's right  But what do you mean  You're out of order  Just yes it's true  Or no it's not  Not true  You're being argumentative  It's true  Okay they're lying on your show  No we're sharing our opinion  We disagree  We're let's  These girls are career women there  Gene  So that would be very interesting 
[03:45:30]  What a guy does  Not that the guy's looks aren't important  But the first thing you're not going to think of  Is how big is his dick  You're going to think what's he do  Is this guy something  Or then it all would come from there  Is he a nice guy  Something to do with his station in life  Right  And the more money  Or the more position he has in life  The more attractive he is  If he comes into a restaurant  And everybody says  See that guy works for the sanitation department  He's not going to get  Well he's not going to get it as easily  As the guy who comes in  Works on Wall Street  Has three houses 
[03:46:00]  Blah blah blah  I asked where they went to school  I'm sorry  Yeah see Gene  I think  You know there are some women  Where that is true  I mean you're talking to three professional women  That support themselves  So I don't know  It might be a little different with us  By allah  You know what  You're  And I say this  Just kidding around by the way  If the ladies in the studio  Are 12 years old  You've got to wait  Until their biological clock kicks in  And then we'll see  Oh okay  Well look at  Here's a perfect example  I wish I didn't have my period yet  Let me tell you  It was much more fun  What do you think attracts Donald Trump's 
[03:46:30]  Melania her name is  She's gorgeous  What attracts her  Or Marlon Maples  To Donald  I mean he's not a bad looking guy  But do you think that they  Both of them are really hot women  They could definitely get better looking guys  Well do you think that these women are intelligent  Let's start with that  Answer the guy's question  Instead of asking your own  So look  Okay let's isolate  Let's isolate the variable then  If there's someone  Looking like Donald Trump  And then you know  Having the same amount of money as he does  Right  So it's  Donald Trump  Yeah  And then there's somebody 
[03:47:00]  Who you're saying is better looking  And has the same amount of money  No that's not what  No  I'm saying  I make a chick with pizza  What attracts them  No no no no no  Okay you're putting in the asterisk  Which is has the same amount of money  I'm not saying that  What I'm saying  If Donald Trump  Let's use Jean's word  Is a sanitation worker  Does he have Melania  Well just speaking from personal experience  I think what attracts women to Donald Trump  Is that he has a certain charisma  Yeah  He has a charismatic  There's a confidence and a charisma  It's called nine zeros  He has nine zeros  Oh he's so full of it 
[03:47:30]  In all fairness  The women that he has been dating  Or he's married  Are not necessarily  I mean looking for like  An ultimate intellectual probably  I mean come on  You know it's true  I think you know  Like okay Donald Trump  You know  Art of the deal or whatever  I think he's also  You know probably perfected  Art of flirting  Like I think he flirts very well  He does  I mean he flirts  He doesn't flirt well enough  To land Melania  If he's a sanitation worker  Guys you have to quit  Because it's not a fair playing field  They're not playing honesty here  They're playing  But some of us are different 
[03:48:00]  You know that's not what the question was  So basically Jean  Because you don't agree with us  We're lying  Is that what you're saying  No I'm saying that you actually agree  That there are women out there  Who are different  That's true  But the guys  Are only talking about  Predominantly  What seems to be the case  That's all  We're not talking about  Exceptions of course  Yeah  Yeah and Jean  You've never been married right Jean  Or you tried it once  No I've never done it  No I can't  I wasn't sure if you did it  A real long time ago  No he's been  He's got the best relationship ever 
[03:48:30]  I have to say though  The exceptions to the rule  For us  Are those other women  That you're talking about  Because we hang out with women  Who are professional  And well educated  Then you have to take a look  At the statistics  Blah blah blah  Of course  But you know what  The best  When you meet women  Who are as bright and charming  As they are  If they don't want to play  The honesty game  Let it go  You will not win  You cannot win  Against these women  Let them win  Yeah Jean's allowed to sleep  With whoever he wants  That's great  Right Jean?  Isn't everyone 
[03:49:00]  Well life should be enjoyed  Every day  Well we were talking about that  But the Irish guy  Can't live the lifestyle  Of Gene Simmons  That's not true  The guy that's selling  Like cars  It's not true  He can always go next door  And borrow a cup of sugar  Yeah that's true  Yeah  But you can't tell the girl  You're dating  Like I'm going to get sugar  You know what I mean?  You can't  No no  Because she's  Remember she's only making  One or two eggs per month  So she sees life  Through different biological eyes  Than the guy does 
[03:49:30]  Guys are hornier right Jean?  Well you know  Imagine the most  Do you really think that?  Yeah  Honestly?  I think that  Just a second  I think so  Imagine  Imagine the most sensitive  Part of your body  Keeps brushing against  Your pants leg  Every step you take  Of course we're more around  I agree with that  And you know  Their button is hidden  They're going  Why do you guys  Think about sex all the time?  Well  Take your little button  And stick it way out there  And just brush it  Against your skirt  Every step you take  I have to just say  I completely disagree  I know so many women 
[03:50:00]  Who are sex obsessed  A lot of them are  You're right  And thinking about it  A lot more than a lot of guys  But again Jean is saying  As a general rule  And he's right  Well as a general rule  The men talk about it more  But doesn't mean  It's not us  We're just repeating information  That's told to us  Social scientists say  That men think about it  Every eight seconds  Women don't  And why is prostitution  So built on females  Being prostitutes for men  Or even gay men  Being prostitutes for other men  That's about power  No it's not  I get them  It's about sex  Back in the day  It was about power  I'm talking about my own  Experience  It's not about power 
[03:50:30]  The guys had the money  Jean I just love the fact  That Jim's trying to win though  That's the best part of it  It was  But I'm talking about prostitution  Like I've spent a lot of cash  On prostitutes  And I mean  A lot of cash  And I understand  What they're saying  But it's not about power  I don't degrade them  It's not like  Suck it and get out  It's about sex  Well to Elizabeth's point  I mean  Rape is about power  But not that  No no  I'm just saying  It originated  When men had money  And women had something to sell  That's how it originated  So it was about power  And men couldn't get the sex  So they figured 
[03:51:00]  Hey maybe it's about power  For the women  Hey look  Give me your money  And I'll give you  What you really want  It's about all of that  It's about all of that  It's kind of washing each other out  Hey Gene  Yeah  Sum up why guys  Should not get married  The whole divorce thing  And losing your money  I was never espousing that  I'm saying that  Life should be a choice  And you should actually  Say what you mean  And mean what you say  And if a guy ever takes the oath  I actually believe in the Catholic notion  Which is if you ever dare  Take that oath  That says you're going to die  In the arms of the person  You're married  You know  50 years from now 
[03:51:30]  In sickness and in health  For you know  For sicker or poor  Richer  All that stuff  You should be held accountable  But everybody lies  You see  They stand in front of their beloved  And their God  And all that stuff  And they say  I'm going to do this  And statistics tell us  That over 50%  Within two years  Split  And I'm going  Wait a second  Both of you took an oath  What happened to that oath  Well we changed our mind  And so  I believe in saying  What you mean  And meaning what you say  And the reason  I can't take that oath  Is because  It's fantasy 
[03:52:00]  And I don't like  Breaking oaths  So I'm not saying  To anyone  Don't get married  I'm just saying  That if you do get married  You should be held accountable  And stay there  In her arms  For 70 years  I support that  The same person  Every day  That's beautiful Gene  That's right  That's beautiful  I'm going to ring with Gene Simmons  What's the name of the DVD  By the way  The inspiration  Speaking in tongues  And where can people get it  In stores  Oh alright 
[03:52:30]  In stores everywhere  Sure  I downloaded it  And just burnt it to a disc  And I'm watching it  I'm kidding Gene  Don't send your goon squads  After me  To beat my head in  In stores and on the internet  Well they wouldn't beat you  They just want to pay my mom  Some more money  So they should buy another house  Gene what's the DVD about  Actually about two years ago  The Australian promoters  Asked me to come down  And just lecture  You know get up there  And tell my life story  And I have peculiar notions  About you know life as we know it 
[03:53:00]  The sort of pure honesty  That doesn't exist  Between the male and the female  Of the species  Because we lie to each other  Every single time  And we see each other  You know when guys  By the way  When guys talk with each other  They tell the absolute truth  I'm going to kick you in the balls  I'm going to do this  I'm going to do that  As soon as you meet a girl  You have such nice hair  Is that a lie?  No I think that's true  Yeah we have to change  We have to speak two languages  We have to speak truth  To each other  And then we have to speak  Flowerly language  To women  Now women want men 
[03:53:30]  To be in touch  With their feminine side  But guys don't care  If you're in touch  With your masculine side  We just want you to be girls  All the time  So women can be women  With each other  And with men  You can just be feminine  We have to be Jekyll and Hyde  Oh  How about that?  I cannot argue that point  No I think that's beautiful  In personal relationships  And maybe that's why  We get so confused in business  Maybe that's true  You can't have it both ways  You can't walk into the boardroom  You can't have it both ways  You can't walk into the boardroom  With lifted and separated outfit 
[03:54:00]  With perfume and beautiful lipstick  And expect us  Who are visually stimulated  To not think about the other stuff  Right  Yeah  Wow  Don't wear the makeup  Don't wear the heels  Come in  You know  See but then we can't be  Quote women  That's a different environment  Well you want us to be in touch  With our feminine side  How about a little truck driver  Nod  You know  Be in touch with a masculine side  That's right  And Gene  It's all coming together  What's your whole theory on cash?  You were saying in these tapes  Cash is good  Well we all  You know because America 
[03:54:30]  Is a remnant of the Puritan  Ethic  We grow up  You know  Victims of all these  Sort of archaic notions  By the way  And I make no  You know  Sort of  Judgments on any of this  If you want to believe in it  That's fine too  We all grow up learning  That love  Is the most powerful force  In the universe  And I wish it were so  You know  I didn't make up these rules  But it's not  Money is the most powerful force  In the universe  And I'll prove it to you  All right  It really is  It's not a romantic notion 
[03:55:00]  It's just life as we know it  Which is  Because of prostitution  Let's say  You can buy sex  Well let's say  Well you can buy anything you want  It's the currency of life  Let's say you're a mother  And you have a child  And of course  The first thing you want to do  Is to feed that child  And to nurture it  And so on  No matter how much you say  I love you to the child  The child will perish  Unless you have money  To sustain it  Which is shelter  Food  Clothing  And so on  So  Before  Before love 
[03:55:30]  You have to have the money  Now it's true that  We all prefer love  It's true that  We wish the world were different  But it's actually not true  That love is the most powerful force  Money is the most powerful force  Money is the currency  Money is the expression of love  I know it's a bizarre notion  But it is  Well the truth of the matter is  In this society  You can't do without money  But you can probably do without some love  Although there are people that would say  Wow  They deserve a radio show  They're actually doing a pretty good job  Can you buy love? 
[03:56:00]  Of course  Well  Men have to  Jim buys love every night  And love  Although I will say though  That money is powerful  But love is what motivates you  To want to go out  And get the money to provide  So maybe you could  I wasn't talking about the motivation  I was just saying  What is  So  Money is really it  And that's okay  And if we get over that notion  Then we get over  Okay  Money is the currency of life  My mother needs a hip operation  You know  I need to feed my child  I'm going to get in there with love  I wonder if it's money or power  Because what does money really give you? 
[03:56:30]  It gives you power  Money is power  Without money you don't have power  Women have a version of power  But it's very  It's only if men are in the mood  Only if you use the money correctly though  I'm sorry  Well that's another issue  Imagine  Imagine the bus of life pulls up  And the door opens  And you go to the guy  I love you  That bus driver is not letting you on the bus  You'd be surprised if they're hot  I bet you we could finagle our way into the bus  Well women have  You know  It's the oldest profession in the world  And it's not prostitution  It's sex  Women have figured out a long time ago 
[03:57:00]  That they can trade  Well you've got some experts here  In terms of using sex to sell  Let me tell you that  Well it's true  You can do that  I don't know  You girls  Did you watch the show?  Of course I did  Okay  I think actually we're clear examples of women  Not using sex to sell  Alright  Listen we only got like 40 seconds left in the show  Gene what do you want to plug today?
