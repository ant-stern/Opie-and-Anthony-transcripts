<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show began with Opie, Anthony, and Jim Norton discussing the show's controversial nature and their defiance of radio norms. Opie recounted a painful ice-fall and a near-apartment fire while cooking steaks, highlighting the contrasting reactions of men and women to crises.  He also described his aggressive online trash-talking in poker and golf. Norton voiced his frustration over Cindy Adams' uncredited use of his jokes from the Gene Simmons roast.  Anthony promoted his new video podcast on home security, portraying himself as a "stark raving lunatic."  An intern's audio piece on self-defense and the justice system was played.

The show then shifted to sports, focusing on the New York Jets' victory and the Redskins' Sean Taylor tribute, leading to a discussion about Taylor's murder and increased robberies targeting athletes.  Imus's return to radio was briefly discussed, along with speculation about his lingering feelings regarding his previous suspension. A listener's audio piece on the death penalty was aired, followed by a segment dedicated to Steve C's wacky sounds and listener remixes.

A call from Heather, a Long Island resident whose boyfriend was murdered during a home invasion, strongly supported Anthony's views on home security and self-defense.  She detailed the aftermath, including the trial and sentencing.  This sparked a lengthy discussion about the death penalty and prison life, featuring callers offering varied perspectives and experiences, including Jeremy, a correctional officer, and Tony, who served time for child neglect.  This segment concluded with promotions for Jim Norton's New Year's Eve show.

The show further delved into listener calls about prison life and the death penalty, with callers sharing contrasting perspectives on life imprisonment versus capital punishment,  providing detailed accounts of prison conditions, gang dynamics, and the treatment of different types of inmates. The conversation then returned to Don Imus's return to radio, with the hosts playing clips from his first broadcast and analyzing his apology and the media's coverage. Jay-Z's perspective on the Imus situation and the double standard regarding free speech was also discussed.

The latter part of the show featured an in-studio interview with Ken Burns, along with Jeffrey Ross, to promote his new World War II documentary, "The War."  Burns discussed his approach, emphasizing personal stories and the emotional impact of the project, comparing the experiences of WWII veterans with those from later conflicts.  He touched upon the challenges of documentary filmmaking, his collaboration with Tom Hanks on *Band of Brothers*, and criticized the History Channel's focus on Nazi Germany. The interview included listener calls from veterans sharing their experiences, and concluded with plugs for Burns's book signings and future projects, including a possible rock and roll documentary.  Lighthearted banter between the hosts and Burns included jokes about vacuum cleaners and the History Channel's nickname, "The Hitler Channel."

[00:01:30]  Woo!  Woo!  Woo!  Woo!  Woo!  Woo!  Hey, good morning.  Hi.  It's Opie.  It's Anthony.  Hello, greetings.  It's Jim Norton.  Jim.  The Opie and Anthony show live and in color.  Ah, that's okay.  Live in color.  In living color. 
[00:02:00]  Why do they have to say that?  Your eyes can tell that.  That was the old days.  That's old school.  Live in living color.  Living color.  The Opie and Anthony show.  Our phone number, 877-212-O-N-A.  Got the pal talk cameras.  We got the instant feedback.  Everything is rocking and rolling.  I think it's up and running.  Man, I'm banged up today, man.  What did you do?  Oh, you might ask, uh, Opie, did you take advantage of some of this, uh, wintery weather 
[00:02:30]  and go, uh, skiing?  A little skiing?  One of my passions.  I love skiing.  Yeah.  Snowboarding, not as much, but have done it.  A little too old for the snowboarding, I guess.  That's best left for the young.  Yeah, but they made the skis cool, finally, because, uh, there was a time, like, if you're  an old school skier with the really long skis, and then you got snowboarding dude, like, just  carving back and forth, he looked cool, and you're like, I'm gonna just go straight down 
[00:03:00]  the hill.  But now they got...  You're shushing.  Well, they finally figured out the technology with the skis, they're a lot shorter, and  they look cool, and you can do a lot of cool things on them, finally.  Maybe not as cool as snowboarding, I think that's still the ultimate if you're gonna be  hitting the mountains, but...  No, I fell down yesterday going to the store to get the morning paper.  Oh, God.  Oh, is that just...  I am banged up.  You slipped in the ice? 
[00:03:30]  Oh, boy, did I, Jimmy.  And this is why, uh, well, I haven't said it to the audience, but I said it to Anthony,  I'm very sad today, because, uh, well, I was in the elevator with this old guy, right?  It was early in the morning, and I just wanted...  Jimmy knows, our supermarket's right there, about a block, block and a half away.  And, uh, I leave the elevator with the old guy, and he leaves the building, and he's in  front of me, and I'm like, ugh, I can't, I can't walk this slow.  Yeah, sometimes you just gotta get around those people.  And it's snowing, it was snowing, and it was icy yesterday, and so I got around him, 
[00:04:00]  like you just said, and I continued my little trot of just jogging, and just as I'm ready  to cross the street, my right leg just, whoa!  Not even a chance of trying to, to, you know, to keep it straight, right?  Yeah.  I go flying on my knee, my, my hand, that's no big deal, really.  My, my pinky's cut up a little bit.  My shoulder, my hip, and my knee, so freaking hard. 
[00:04:30]  I'm like, holy crap.  I think I just, I just, I think I just twisted my knee out, right?  So, you know when you fall down, and it doesn't matter if you fall in the rain, in a puddle,  in the mud, in the snow, you just wanna lay there for a second, and just kinda like, assess  the damages.  Yeah, you wanna see if you're, uh, anything's busted.  Yeah, cause it, and then you just wanna kinda go like, holy jeez, I just kinda fell.  Yeah, the last thing I care about is that I'm in like, you know, slushy, icy, wet snow.  And you're already in it. 
[00:05:00]  I don't care, I'll, I'll change my clothes when I get back to the apartment.  I just wanna lay there to see if I'm, I'm effed up.  Mm-hmm.  The old guy that I passed, he comes running up to me, and, and he's helping me up.  By, you know, you know how you help someone up by grabbing their elbow and stuff, and I wanna  go, just leave me the, mm, alone.  I just wanna lay here.  Cause I don't know what the hell's wrong with me.  I'll get up in my own good time.  So he's being, you know, he's really trying to be nice, and he helps me up by, lifting  me up by my elbow. 
[00:05:30]  And then I thought to myself, this is the first time in my life that I've ever been  helped up, and it's really depressing.  That is really depressing.  Get you a medical alert button.  Right!  Yeah.  Even back in the days when we were fighting and stuff, you know, and you get knocked out  or something, no one's helping you up.  Nah.  You eventually get up on your own.  Get up by yourself.  I'm like, this is a sad day.  The first time ever being helped up.  Slipped on the ice, you slipped on the, uh, go walking down the stairs and done that foot 
[00:06:00]  slide off the stairs and crack your tailbone kind of thing.  There's plenty of, plenty of times you've fallen through your life, but then you just kind  of, you get up.  Oh, and an old guy helped you up?  He had to be 70.  He had to be pushing 70.  Oh, that's terrible.  And the guy can move, man, because he ran across the street to help me.  I'm like, just let me be here, you know, in my misery, and let me figure out what the  hell's wrong with me before, uh, before I decide to get up.  Yeah.  I'm just banged up, but man, my right shoulder is killing me today. 
[00:06:30]  And then the night ended with me almost burning down my apartment, so it was a great weekend.  What happened there?  I, uh, decided to go back to the same supermarket to, to get a couple steaks.  Haven't had steak in a while.  Oh, no.  Got a nice cut.  And I throw, I throw some, uh, balsamic vinaigrette dressing on the top, seasoned it up, right?  But instead of like mushing the, uh, the dressing into the steak, you know, just to give it a  little lube so it's not nice, so it's not dry. 
[00:07:00]  So it was just a pile of dressing kind of thick on the top of both.  I just threw it in the broiler, went back to full tilt poker.  And all of a sudden Lindsay goes, you know, it sounds like the steaks are burning.  I'm like, yeah, yeah.  No, it sounds like that.  That's good.  That's a good crackling sound.  Exactly.  Because I kind of hear the crackling in the background.  She goes, it sounds like the steaks are on fire.  I'm like.  Sizzling.  They're sizzling.  Ah, ah, ah.  A couple more hands.  Because I've got to figure out in my head how much time I need for the steaks, right?  She goes, no, I really think they're on fire. 
[00:07:30]  There's a little smoke coming out of the oven.  Like, ah.  Natural.  And then she finally says it a third time.  Like, all right, I'll check on the steaks.  I open the door.  Flame shooting right up my cabinets almost to the ceiling.  Maybe not almost to the ceiling, but at least two feet.  At least.  Wow.  It was like halfway to the ceiling, but up the cabinets.  I'm like, oh, close the oven.  Turn it off immediately.  Smoke is filling up my apartment.  We call downstairs.  And Lindsay's like, ah. 
[00:08:00]  And I'm like, no, no, no, no.  Because I don't want a big scene.  I don't want a fire department.  I'm like, I want to.  I got to try to figure this out on my own.  But it's still like, it's still a blazing.  She goes, ah, never mind.  She hangs up the phone.  And then she runs to try to find a fire extinguisher.  I just moved in here like three or four months ago.  And all I hear is her running and screaming.  She ran from one side of the apartment all the way back saying no fire extinguisher.  And no real exciting ending to the story.  The flames finally went out in the steak.  But my whole place just smoked out.  The best way, I think, to put out a steak fire in the oven so you could still salvage the steaks is you take a wet dish towel and just throw it over the steaks. 
[00:08:30]  You're a smart man.  That way you can still eat them and it puts the fire out.  You know, there's a difference between a guy and a girl.  You're absolutely right because I was trying to figure out how to do this because I had like a cup of water.  And I'm like, man, this is like a.  You don't want to throw a cup in there.  It's like, this is a grease fire.  That can make it a little worse, I'm thinking, right? 
[00:09:00]  And then Lindsay's trying to find the fire extinguisher.  And I'm sitting there like, as the apartment is filling up with smoke, no exaggeration, it's pretty bad.  Man, I'm still thinking in my head, I could salvage these steaks.  I still want to eat.  That's a guy's mentality.  And you know what?  I paid good money for these steaks.  I didn't go for like a cheap cut.  I was like, you know, I don't have steak often.  I'm going for the Mac Daddy, the nice New York strip, right?  Yeah.  And that's all I'm thinking as the smoke is pouring out of the oven.  And I'm like, I got to save these steaks, man. 
[00:09:30]  And she's just thinking fire extinguisher, get the fire.  And then I was ready to take the whole tray out, which was ablaze.  Oh, no, that's never a good idea.  No.  And throw it in the sink and then like, you know, just douse it with the hosy thing.  And I'm like, that's going to ruin the steak.  That's going to take the flavor out.  That's got a lot of time seasoning these steaks.  Yeah, with gasoline, apparently.  But that's where guys and girls are completely different.  I'm still thinking, save the steak.  She's thinking, put out the effing fire immediately.  Don't burn the place down. 
[00:10:00]  We could always get new steaks, right?  So it was quite a day yesterday, man.  Falling down and burning your apartment down.  That's wonderful.  Right.  And then trash talking people on Omaha, the dumbest freaking online card game ever.  I've never played Omaha.  I know how it's played.  I've watched it.  But I don't know.  There's too many cards for me.  I'm a hold'em guy, regular.  You know, Texas hold'em.  On full tilt.  There's way too much luck involved in Omaha.  But I'm not playing for real money because people are trying to find me. 
[00:10:30]  I'm just fooling around.  You got any fans that pop in and find you somehow?  Yeah.  Dude, play with you.  Like, what?  Two people were in the room, and they obviously were friends.  And they're laughing because they want a lame hand, so they're LOLing like crazy.  And it's not real money.  So I'm like, okay, now we're going to have some fun.  So I'm just effing with them until I got the Mac Daddy hand and wiped both of them out.  And then I wrote, F-U-L-O-L-F-U-L-O-L a lot. 
[00:11:00]  And the guy goes, you know, you're not going to last too long playing like that.  And I wrote back, hey, dope, this is fake money.  It's not real money.  You can reload chips every five minutes.  Who cares?  I hear when I get knocked out and someone goes, GG, good game.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  I write G-A, and then I leave.  It's get AIDS.  That's what I said.  I don't even want to hear it.  Good game.  Shove it.  I just lost money.  I'm just starting to get into online gaming because I got bored.  Make a deposit, dude. 
[00:11:30]  What do you mean?  Oh, you'll have more fun with the real money.  It's a lot more exciting.  No, no, no, no.  No, I don't care.  I'm not a gambler.  Oh, it's more exciting that way.  You don't have to be a gambler.  I'll go to a casino and I'll gamble a bit.  No problem.  But I'm not like you.  You get into it.  I kind of like the thrill of it all.  I mean, can I throw a couple thousand in an online account and play?  Probably, but it's not the most exciting thing.  But I guess what I'm getting at, I love the golf games, and I'm playing Tiger Woods, 
[00:12:00]  and I finally went online.  I told you about that, too.  And these people, you remind me of this.  Before you start, they're like, GL, GG, good luck.  And then good shot, GS.  Right, right.  G, D, good drive.  N, D, nice drive.  And if you really do a good shot, it's X, S.  Yeah, yeah.  Excellent shot, or X, X, S.  Or X, X, X, S. 
[00:12:30]  That's if it goes in the hole.  And everyone's so nice and sweet and kind to each other.  And so I took it the other way, man.  You know, if someone makes a horrible shot, I just write, you suck.  You suck.  Just to make it interesting.  Because these people are all goody-two-shoes on this Tiger Woods Online crap.  Just get the acronym for shove it up your...  Oh, I've done that.  Yeah.  I've done that.  Just using all sorts of letters.  G-F-Y. 
[00:13:00]  Right, right, right.  G-F-Y is a good one.  And G-F-Y.  Go F, yes.  I came up with a few.  I can't remember.  Yeah.  Really long ones that just made me laugh my ass off.  Go S in your H.  And then someone, someone, take a long walk off a short tee.  Don't teach them.  And then someone wrote me back saying, you know, basically saying, are you trashing me?  Right.  And I started just putting question marks. 
[00:13:30]  Why?  I started putting question marks like I'm, you know, I'm foreign.  Yeah.  Huh?  What?  Huh?  K?  K?  K?  I don't understand your weird letters.  Well, that was my Sunday.  How was everybody else's Sunday?  A wonderful time.  Yeah.  Can I interject how irritated I am right now?  Why?  Cindy Adams quoted three of my jokes from the Gene Simmons roast.  Oh, I was wondering.  All three of them are mine.  And she doesn't credit me for any of them.  No credit?  She screws up my, she screws up one of the jokes and then.  You dummy. 
[00:14:00]  And then she credits Carrot Top for one.  What?  For your joke?  I, I, uh.  Yeah, Jimmy was out in L.A. for the Gene Simmons roast.  You know, I read that.  It's going to be on A&E, right?  It's going to be on Family Jewel.  I read that and thought, that doesn't sound like Carrot Top would say something like that.  No.  Swear to you.  It's, it's a really short piece.  Uh, I just saw this as you were talking about.  It's Gene Simmons of Kiss was afforded the great honor of a roast in L.A.  So filthy that a high class refined person such as myself can't mention the lines thrown out.  Uh, he said, other than somebody, which would be Jim Norton, said of one famous female, Cher, 
[00:14:30]  um, her vagina is so large that the Verizon man couldn't get reception in certain parts.  Um, and another, about another famous female, her private parts are used as a DNA base for  law and order, which is not the way I said that joke.  And it was about Lisa Lampanelli.  Uh, it's not the way I said it.  And then she gives Carrot Top credit for the joke I made about Paul Stanley.  Yeah.  I said, uh, he broke his hip.  I think, uh, his hip, he had to have his hip replaced.  I think he broke it falling out of the closet. 
[00:15:00]  And, uh, and, uh.  That's funny.  And, uh.  How are you doing?  And she doesn't give me credit for any of them.  It's like, come on.  I mean, not that you need credit for everything you do, but if you guys quote three of them.  She's going to quote three jokes.  I didn't mention law and order.  In her crappy little, no.  In her crappy little, uh, column.  Right, right, right.  Oh, boy.  Dummy.  How was your weekend there, Ant?  Oh, good.  I spent most of it, um, making my first, uh, um, video podcast. 
[00:15:30]  Oh, no.  Which will be up, um, uh, later.  Later today.  I was editing it.  Um.  What's the podcast all about?  Well, I, uh, it's sort of a thing.  I'm, look, I was kind of looking for some kind of outlet there.  So, uh, I did it from, uh, my office.  It's just.  Harum.  Anthony's office.  And, uh, I'm kind of sitting there in a very comfy chair, uh, with, um, my, uh, kind of TV console wood thing behind me. 
[00:16:00]  It looks very, very classy look to it.  Do you have a Christmas sweater on?  No, no, no Christmas sweater.  But the TV being there is good because I could superimpose stuff on the TV as I talk about it.  And my first one went on for like 20 minutes.  I didn't know I had so much in me about this subject.  But it was home security and home invasion.  And, uh, prevention of and how.  And, you know, I talk about it a lot here on the show.  But this is unencumbered by people calling me crazy. 
[00:16:30]  So, uh, but as I watched it, I realized I look crazier than ever.  Oh, boy, do you.  Wait, do you have a video camera hooked up?  Or do you use it with, like, one of the Paltalk cameras?  Oh, no, I have a video.  I have a very, very good video camera.  It's all in, uh, widescreen.  It looks very nice.  I have lighting and everything.  It looks very nice.  But I sound like a stark raving lunatic going off.  And I show off some of the, um, the hardware that I keep around the house and talk about it a little bit. 
[00:17:00]  And, um, and then on the TV, I'm able to kind of superimpose things on there that, uh, uh, are pertinent to what I'm talking about.  You produced, he produced his own show.  You produced, like, a television show.  Yes, I did.  Well, that's good.  That's like one of those Metro Channel.  Like, what are they called?  It was exactly it.  Sandy Paint, Public Access.  You know, Public Access.  You know what, Jimmy?  Let's not complain, though.  That's very productive, Anthony.  Very good.  I just decided I would do that and pop it online and, uh, see what happens.  But I, I gotta get online later. 
[00:17:30]  I was just finishing editing last night.  I was gonna be stupid enough to say at least you weren't heavy drinking all weekend.  But I'm sure you were doing that.  But at least you were being productive by making your own TV show.  Actually, during the entire...  Instead of driving fast and sports cars and going down to casinos.  Well, it was snowing and I couldn't drive fast.  I'm sure you had Bud Lights.  No, actually.  Actually, the, uh, the sponsor of, uh, this, uh, podcast was, uh, none other than Captain  Morgan.  Oh, good.  Did you paint a funny mustache on yourself instead of red?  It's short and black right under your nose. 
[00:18:00]  Yeah, exactly.  The captain was here?  Now someone, now someone, Fast Freddy, not someone, he's a faithful listener of the show.  He writes, podcasts are for queers.  Ah, well, uh, most of them are.  I'll agree with you.  Most are.  But see when you're a popular shock talk.  Right.  People are going to see this podcast.  It ties in with the show.  I bring up, you know, the fact that, uh, uh, with the Opie and Anthony show, of course,  put our little pictures up there and, uh, talk about the show and how you guys goof on 
[00:18:30]  me about the subject of, uh, home invasion and security and things like that.  And then I go off talking about it as I sit, um, loading up one of my clips.  It's, it's very disturbing.  When, uh, when do we get to see it?  And that is going up to, uh, tonight, right when I get home, where, uh, I'm putting it  on YouTube, uh, break, I'll just put it everywhere.  Screw it.  How many minutes is it?  It's, it's long.  That's just it.  I got to edit it down a little bit.  Do it in different parts, man.  I could do it in different parts. 
[00:19:00]  Long videos don't, uh, go viral.  I know.  That's why I got to, I got to find some good out points, maybe do it in, uh, three parts  or something.  Yeah.  If it's 15 minutes or whatever, maybe make it either four, four minute ones for close  to 16 minutes or three.  Yeah.  That's what I'll do.  Yeah.  But it, it, it runs by pretty quick.  It's pretty smooth.  And it's, um, it's, uh, I think there's some humor in it.  You got to do, you got to do it in sections.  And at the end of each section, it has to have a tease for the next part.  Right.  And then you're going to be, here's what's coming up.  You're going to be a video, uh, star.  Oh yeah. 
[00:19:30]  Hey, speaking of which, yes, Jim podcast, man.  It's like, if you could put a decent one up, it's amazing.  You put something on the web and just 5 million people can check it out.  Yeah.  That's just it.  And you know, it plugs the show.  So Patrice's, uh, podcasts are pretty good.  Yeah.  Those are really funny.  We were checking those out the other day.  What is he doesn't with Dante?  And, uh, they look like, like a professional production.  So a podcast, I, I, I was looking at this.  I know Mac has a thing where you can kind of, they make it fairly simple to do a podcast.  And, uh, it's kind of like your own little TV show, man. 
[00:20:00]  I use my Mac, uh, to do all the editing and stuff.  It's, it's amazing.  And the camera itself is so cool.  I got a hard drive on the camera.  So now I don't have to use tape and in real time, transfer the tape over to the thing.  I pop the hard drive off, pop it into the computer and drag and drop the whole file.  I just shot right onto the computer and start editing.  Wow.  No real time crap.  It's so much faster.  Can I, uh, can I make a cameo in one of your video?  Absolutely.  I was thinking we should do what we had spoken about, uh, which is a good, uh, promotion 
[00:20:30]  for the show and, you know, and that, it could look very cool.  We could set it up looking very funny and, um, and people would be captivated by, uh, what's  on the table.  Should we, uh, I said, wow.  Do we do it before we leave for vacation?  Yeah, I think we should.  So we have to start, uh, producing.  We have to, the first thing we got to do is actually come up with the logistics of the  thing itself. 
[00:21:00]  Gotcha.  So that way we can, we, we know where we're going.  Yeah.  But the first thing could be a good teaser.  We could do a teaser without putting out any information and then think of that later.  And I'm being sneaky and I got a great idea.  Yeah, we have a great idea.  Oh, it's a biggie.  It is a biggie.  That's all we can say right now.  It's a biggie.  Are you going to be nude?  Oh, it's a biggie.  Hey, speaking of, uh, ants, ants, uh, home invasion stuff.  Uh, intern Tony made this last week.  So this is a, this is a great segue.  Let's, uh, let's take a listen to Tony's work. 
[00:21:30]  The intern here.  Today, we are talking to people who say they're the ones who are being treated like criminals.  They say their stories are cases of self-defense, but the system is treating them like cold-blooded  killers.  The average citizen is a victim and an idiot.  We're going to talk to a man who says to have a deadly weapon to defend yourself.  I have lights on my guns.  I have holographic sights.  I have more guns in the closet.  How about that? 
[00:22:00]  How else are you supposed to support, uh, to stop somebody, get in their tracks?  I will have the element of surprise.  No one can enter my bedroom when I am at this cover point.  I have full cover.  Your life is on the line.  What do you do?  Pile the bodies up at the door.  Once it passes my doorway to the death.  Do you have a gun?  Do you have a knife?  Do you have all that stuff around?  What are you crazy?  Why would I want to get into a knife fight with somebody?  Your victim's waiting to happen.  Defend yourself.  Been a lovely effing war. 
[00:22:30]  Eh, not bad.  That's Tony the intern, uh, putting that together for us today.  All right.  Our phone number, 877-212-ONA.  Just getting started here.  It's Opie and Anthony.  You're checking out the Opie and Anthony show.  Big win for the Jets yesterday.  Big win!  I know.  Who gives a crap, right?  Oh, it's good.  You don't want to lose to play the Dolphins, right?  Well, that's why I should care. 
[00:23:00]  I want to see the Dolphins go...  What do you call it?  Un...  Un...  Winless.  Uh, un-win-a-did.  Un-win-a-did.  Un-win-a-did.  Let's call it un-win-a-did.  I want to see the Dolphins go, un-win-a-did.  Yeah.  Where are the Dolphins?  Oh, and...  What are we up to, 13 now?  12?  That's harder to do than win one.  It really is.  It's one of those things where...  You know when you play the Keno and you pick so many numbers that if you get no numbers, 
[00:23:30]  you win?  Because it's harder to get no numbers at that point?  That's what it's like.  It's harder not to win one goddamn game.  How cool would it be if the Dolphins don't win a game, Pats win all their games?  That would be...  In the same year, that would be pretty damn cool to check out, right?  Oh, they'd be talking about it for hours.  And I guess down there in Washington, what did they do?  They did something very special.  Where's the story?  Oh, Redskins honor Sean Taylor. 
[00:24:00]  They used only 10 men on first defensive play.  And they lose to the Bills 17-16 yesterday.  Was it because of the play?  That would be great.  What an honor.  What happened?  The weird thing is, at first I thought, well, maybe it was this guy's girlfriend.  But he was shot in the leg, in the femur.  And he bled to death from a shot in the leg.  No one who you know is going to kill you by shooting you in the leg and hoping you bleed  out.  Yeah.  That had to be a real murder.  They didn't want to kill him.  They arrested, what, four or five guys?  Yeah. 
[00:24:30]  And these guys were at a party at his house.  And these guys were like, I see a lot of nice stuff around here.  Real thugs, man.  I saw the mug shots.  Oof.  Why would you invite them over?  So, they were at a party.  And then they, I guess they robbed him a few weeks prior, right?  Or tried to.  I think they tried to.  And he heard like a rattling or whatever.  And then they came back.  And then they weren't expecting him to be home.  So then what do you got?  You shoot him in the leg.  Oh, they didn't want to kill him?  Of course not.  No. 
[00:25:00]  Probably as a warning, like, hey, you know who we are.  We're here.  Pop.  Let me pop you in the leg.  You keep your mouth shut.  Got what?  Animals.  And then it hits your main little pumper there in your leg.  And it's over, Channy.  That's a big thing lately, though, to rob the athletes.  They would just, as you say.  There's a few of them now.  There's a guy who just got stabbed.  Apparently was part of some rapper's posse who would rob.  There's like 20 of them.  And they would kind of like rob celebrities that they would see with all the gold and jewelry on down by these Manhattan clubs. 
[00:25:30]  That's a ballsy move.  No kidding.  There's 20 guys.  Yeah.  Well, I want to say hi to that.  People listening to us in New York today.  It's all about Imus' return.  Yes.  I couldn't say this.  Every effing channel has Imus' face on it.  I felt like a father whose kid was going to school the first day.  First day of school.  First day back.  I don't know why I'm so happy.  I mean, it doesn't affect me at all.  No, it does affect us.  It's good for radio.  Yeah, it is.  That you can come back from something like what Imus did. 
[00:26:00]  But he is kind of still apologizing, it seems like.  There were a couple of quotes in the paper from an interview that he did that he says, you'll never hear a racist word come out of my mouth.  You'll never hear it.  I'll be still thinking.  Yeah.  Yeah.  He goes out to his ranch.  He probably rides his horse 20 miles away from any civilization.  Gets out on top of a big rock.  Looks around.  There's nothing but horizon everywhere.  And then just yells the N-word as loud as he can. 
[00:26:30]  Could you imagine?  Could you imagine?  Then the horse rats him out.  Oh, is there anybody protesting?  They protested in Boston.  It's funny.  I didn't hear a lot of black outrage over Star being rehired.  No.  He should be rehired.  He got rehired at a college radio station.  I think you have to actually break your radio, tuning it over that far to the left.  Yeah.  There's no numbers there.  You've got to pencil them in yourself.  You know you... 
[00:27:00]  Eh, whatever.  I was going to make a call letter joke.  You know when you look at call letters and it just makes you feel uncomfortable that it's not a really good radio station?  Might be a little too inside for everybody.  That's true.  You know, a lot of these call letters, they just flow.  Yep.  You know, WXRK here in New York.  It kind of flows.  You've got WBCN.  It flows, right?  He's working at 87.5 WNYX. 
[00:27:30]  WNYX.  Just makes you feel uncomfortable.  87.5.  Does the dial go that far?  It doesn't.  Yeah.  It's a television broadcast relay.  Nice.  It went over into the television band?  Yeah.  It's a cable access relay that broadcasts also on radio.  Wait.  So he's doing TV?  That's great.  Huh?  He's doing TV?  No.  No, it's on the radio, but they have to use a TV carrier signal or something.  Yeah, an old VHF.  Wow.  That's great. 
[00:28:00]  That was the best he could do to come back on radio, huh?  Yeah.  It might be two inside, but it's Starr here in New York.  He's another guy that effed up pretty bad.  Just to go back just a little bit, Football Picks, sponsored by Dish Network.  Time to get more TV from your TV.  Sign up for Dish Network today.  The big winner is who?  Fan.  I had five.  You had six, right?  Yeah.  Congratulations to Fan, this week's winner.  What was your strategy, Fan, for picking?  Um, I went with the old Sam route. 
[00:28:30]  What's that?  I didn't do any research.  Just deny your race and guess?  Yeah.  I didn't do any research whatsoever and just circled the pretty picture.  I, you know, just picked them randomly.  Well, there you go.  You got a win this week.  Yep.  Nice.  And your congratulations.  $250 richer.  Yeah.  Woo!  Wow, that's nice.  All right.  Uh, the Steve C thing continues.  What's Steve Steve?  Yes.  I got to find the sounds, but someone to, uh, explain the Steve C wacky sounds he makes? 
[00:29:00]  Well, there's...  Ah!  Really?  Oh, boy.  All I was doing also this weekend was, uh, singing, uh, um, Tears of Fallen, that song.  Oh, really?  And doing it like Steve.  I just, I couldn't get enough of it.  Well, Steve, uh...  Oh, no!  It was like the executive producer of the Opie and Anthony show.  He makes a lot of weird noises when he's doing his production to warm up his voice.  I don't think...  Yeah.  His excuse is he does this to warm up his voice.  I don't think so. 
[00:29:30]  I think...  He's just being crazy.  Yeah.  So, sounds like this come out of his mouth.  Ow!  Ow!  What?  Ow!  Ow!  What an ass.  I hate that.  And then our favorite.  Ow!  I didn't realize!  Ow!  What are you warming your voice up for?  To be a rape victim?  That's horrendous.  Yeah, well.  Let me see.  Oh, okay.  I hate that.  He's a fool.  There's a new Steve sound that came in?  God, people look forward to the new Steve sound. 
[00:30:00]  Oh, yeah.  Who wouldn't?  Here's a brand new one that came in last week.  I like this one.  Oh, hold on.  Yeah.  Nom, nom, nom, nom, nom, nom, nom, nom, nom, nom, nom.  Was that looped?  No.  No?  That's just him doing that.  Is that Steve in the men's room?  Yum, yum.  That's the yum, yum, yum, yum.  Yum, yum, yum, yum.  Yum, yum, yum, yum. 
[00:30:30]  Yum, yum, yum, yum, yum.  Wow.  His face pressed up against a stall door with a hole in it.  Looking at someone with a wide stance.  That's the noise you make when you find out Larry Craig is in the stall next to you.  Yeah.  Mmm, yum, yum, yum, yum, yum, yum, yum, yum, yum, yum, yum, yum, yum, yum.  So people have been taking those sounds and throwing them into little songs.  Yep.  Quick songs.  Just a little quick piece.  This is Danny and Than came up with this one. 
[00:31:00]  Of course, this is leading to a brand new one, but I have to play the one that Anthony was singing all weekend long.  Yeah.  The Kiss song, Tears Are Falling.  This one's one of my favorites.  It's the best one so far.  Yeah. 
[00:31:30]  Absolutely.  Here we go.  Come on.  I don't hear somebody.  I don't hear somebody.  I don't hear somebody.  I don't hear somebody.  It really sounds like he's singing.  Ah, that's great.  That one worked perfectly, right?  Who was that?  Who gets the credit?  Cradle of Milf got sent that one in. 
[00:32:00]  And then we got this one from Brad the Rooster in MI, Michigan, I guess.  He put one together called Living on a Bear.  Hmm.  Okay.  I think I see where this is going.  A little Bon Jovi action, right?  Oh.  Here we go.  Oh, I didn't realize.  I think I see where this is going.  Oh, I didn't realize.  Oh, I didn't realize.  Oh, I didn't realize.  Oh, I didn't realize. 
[00:32:30]  Oh, I didn't realize.  You know, that fits in a lot.  I started thinking that this might be, you know, ran its course, but I think game on still.  No, there's still some geniuses out there. 
[00:33:00]  I want to, you want to hear The Joker by Cody in Indiana or, let's see, Axle F?  Yeah, that's good.  You like that one?  All right, let's play that one to end this little segment.  Oh, no.  Chris from West Virginia.  Yeah, they're all really, really good.  We got about 10 of them at this point. 
[00:33:30]  Oh, I didn't realize.  Oh, I didn't realize.  Oh, I didn't realize. 
[00:34:00]  What?  What?  There you have it for today.  Wow.  Steve is talented.  We're going to have to play Living on a Bear later on this morning.  That's a good one.  That one's really good.  Let's say hi to Heather on Long Island.  Heather.  Heather, what's up?  Hey, what's up, guys?  Hey, man.  I just wanted to tell Anthony that I agree with him 100% with his whole plan for a home  invasion.  I was involved in a home invasion in 2003 when my boyfriend was killed.  Are you kidding me? 
[00:34:30]  Hold on, hold on, hold on.  Slow down.  Oh, no.  That sucks.  What happened?  Oh, no.  Yeah, these guys, two masked men came in with guns, and they were demanding drugs and money  and the whole line, guys, which we didn't have.  And we kept telling them that we didn't have anything there.  And, you know, they were very determined, you know.  And they ended up taking me and taking me into another room, and I got up to run out because  I thought the one guy was going to end up raping me, and he hit me with a gun.  I fell on the floor.  He started beating the crap out of me.  And my boyfriend got up and ran at him to try to protect me, and they shot and killed 
[00:35:00]  him.  And I just want to say that exactly how you said, when these things happen, that you  think in your head, if only I had a gun, and that's exactly what I've been thinking  for four years.  So I just want to tell you that you're right.  Wait, let me ask you now.  Did you know the guys?  No, we didn't, actually.  We went to trial a year and a half later.  So for a year and a half, I had no idea why they were in the house.  And it turns out that they had some kind of misinformation.  They had the right house, but they had the wrong people living in there. 
[00:35:30]  Wait, what do you mean?  Hold on, hold on.  What do you mean they had the right house, but the wrong people?  The people that...  They had some kind of misinformation from I don't know who, that two different people,  it was my boyfriend and his roommate, that two different people lived in the house.  So they were staking out the house, you know, trying to figure out what times we got home,  what times, you know, people weren't there.  And they wanted to get us when we were there because they had, they thought there was some  kind of hidden drugs and a safe in the house and all this stuff that wasn't there.  They ended up, they got $40 off my boyfriend's dresser and his chain. 
[00:36:00]  And, you know, that was it.  How did they get in?  I have no idea.  To this day, I have no idea.  I mean, my boyfriend had a problem with not locking the doors, and I always tried to make  sure I did it.  But I'm thinking that they came in before we got home and just were hiding somewhere.  I'm not 100% sure.  That's a bad one.  Wow.  I just want to, like I said, I just want to tell you that you're 100% right because this  shit happens, I'm sorry, this stuff happens to innocent people all the time, and to be 
[00:36:30]  prepared is definitely a good idea.  So after you shot, he got shot, did those guys just run out of the house?  Yeah, because I ended up, the guy hit me in the face with the gun.  I was knocked unconscious for a little while, and I heard gunshots, but it sounded real far  away.  And when I lifted my head up, the guys were gone, and my boyfriend, you know, was holding  his chest bleeding, and, you know, we called the ambulance, his roommate and I, and, you  know, he was alive for a little bit, but, you know, he didn't make it.  What happened to the guy? 
[00:37:00]  Is they in jail?  Yeah, the one guy who killed him is in jail for life, and the other guy pled guilty to  murder in a second degree.  He testified against the guy who shot him, and he got 17 to life.  Did they ever apologize for it in trial?  No, actually, the guy who did it, we went to trial, and the whole time he pled innocence,  he used to smirk at us, look back, and smile, and he was a real dead bag.  And up until the day he was sentenced, the judge, you know, asked him, do you have anything  to say for yourself?  And he said, oh, no, just that I'm innocent. 
[00:37:30]  He pled innocence the whole time.  He had no remorse at all.  All right, good.  Well, for the rest of his life, he'll be face down with another man behind him.  Only hope.  I'm hoping so.  Well, I mean, that's the only, or he'll be behind another man.  Either way, he's not actually going to live a good life.  Yeah, a good life, but the fact that he's still breathing and alive and doing whatever  he's doing is still bothersome.  But, yeah, I mean, I'm very fortunate that he was caught and everything.  Well, this brings up an interesting question.  What do you think of the death penalty?  Um, I actually wasn't sure up until this point in my life after this happened. 
[00:38:00]  You know, I personally would like to administer it on this guy, obviously.  But at this point, I think that, yeah, I mean, my boyfriend is not able to live, breathe,  play cards, watch TV, work out, whatever they do in jail.  And this guy is.  So, you know, I absolutely 100% agree with it now.  At the very least, it should be up to the victim's family, man.  Yeah.  If they want the death penalty or not, at the very least.  Yeah, I agree with you.  The judge had said, too, you know, he said, if I could give this to you, I would. 
[00:38:30]  You know, he was like, I got very emotional about it.  The judge, it was his last case.  He was retiring.  And, you know, he was disgusted with the guy as well.  And then the fact that he did show no remorse.  And, you know, I'm a little grateful to the other guy for testifying against him,  except I feel like he did it more for himself.  Of course.  Of course he did.  But either way, it doesn't matter why.  I'm so glad it worked out that way because I think it helped a lot, you know, the case.  You know, I see a lot of murderers, they don't get life in jail.  You know, I read about a lot of cases that are unsolved. 
[00:39:00]  So I'm grateful for the way it turned out, I guess, in a bad situation.  Did you move on and find, like, a new boyfriend?  Did it take you a while?  Um, I moved on, you know.  I mean, it affects me, of course, you know, in certain ways.  But, yeah, I mean, I moved on.  I'm a young girl, you know.  I had no choice.  I was 22 when it happened.  He was 23, you know.  You can't stop your life.  I always wonder when something like that happens.  Like, because obviously, like, the new guy you're dating knows what happened.  And, like, does the new guy get threatened when you're kind of grieving or missing your old boyfriend? 
[00:39:30]  Like, at a holiday or something?  It's funny.  Yeah, but it depends on the guy.  I mean, I've dated a few, and some guys are very, very threatened by it because they feel that they're never going to compare to this guy, that, you know, he saved your life, and how will I ever compare to him?  And, you know, it takes a special guy to understand, you know, a situation.  I mean, I don't miss my boyfriend in the romantic sense anymore.  I miss him as a person.  I wish he was alive so he could have the things I have now, you know, and continue his life the way I can, you know, and think it's a shame what happened. 
[00:40:00]  And I, you know, but some guys think that, respect me for it and feel that, you know, wow, you went through this hard time, and you're strong, and, you know, you didn't turn to drugs, and you didn't just stop your life.  And, you know, some people respect me for it, but some guys feel threatened by it.  So, you know, I mean, the longer that time goes on, I guess, the easier it is for guys to accept because it wasn't so recent, you know.  Wow.  Your story just gave me chills, man.  Just chills.  Jeez.  So do you own a gun? 
[00:40:30]  I don't, no, but I absolutely, when I have a house, and, you know, I'm absolutely going to.  And hopefully I can have a plan, you know, as good as Anthony's.  Just have a plan.  Think about it.  There was another home invasion over the weekend on Long Island.  Yeah, I know.  Long Island's just a mecca of home invasions.  I was wondering about that because we're being hurt in Boston on BCN, obviously.  I wonder if it happens as much in Boston as it does on Long Island.  It just seems like it happens all the time.  All the time.  I mean, we kind of make fun of it a little bit because Anthony's, you know, gun obsession and all that. 
[00:41:00]  But the reality is, you know, I think we said way more than one a week.  It has to be more than one a week.  Yeah, it definitely is.  It has to be more than one a week, home invasions on Long Island.  I don't even watch the news anymore.  Since it happened, I don't watch the news.  I don't want to watch the news.  Yeah, I guess.  Man, I don't know what's going on here in New York, but yesterday's Sunday paper was just death and destruction.  Page after page after page.  A couple of guys got shot because some guy in a bar took his drink. 
[00:41:30]  Like, is that what?  That is probably the most senseless thing you could do.  Hey, that's my drink.  Let me shoot you.  Right.  Oh, God.  All right.  Unbelievable.  A little too common.  Yeah.  All right, Heather.  Heather, thanks for giving us a...  Go get yourself a nice shotgun for your house.  I plan on it.  Yeah.  Thanks for a little taste of reality today, Heather.  All right.  No problem, guys.  Hang in there, all right?  All right.  Thanks.  All right.  There's Heather on Long Island.  And we'll be back. 
[00:42:00]  It's Opie and Anthony.  It's the Opie and Anthony Show.  Good morning.  It's the Opie and Anthony Show.  Let's not forget about a little Jimmy Norton's New Year's Eve show.  Yeah.  Thanks, man.  It's 8 o'clock at North Fork Theater in Westbury, Long Island.  It's the old Westbury Music Fair.  Tickets on sale now.  Ticketmaster or the box office is 516-334-0800.  That's New Year's Eve.  I'll be there.  I'm very happy you're coming. 
[00:42:30]  That's how I'm spending New Year's Eve with Jeannie.  I think I'm going to be there, too, Jimmy.  I really think so.  Oh, good, man.  We've got to find something to do after.  Just do something fun.  F.H. Riley's in the heart of Huntington Village.  Shut up, Tom.  I would actually go there.  It's been a while.  I had cheesecake there.  Yeah.  That was very delicious.  That's my sister's cheesecake.  We're trying to get a cheesecake business going with my sister.  Yeah.  She's actually a great baker.  F.H. Riley's is my brother's joint in Huntington Village.  All right. 
[00:43:00]  Hey, I knew this was coming in.  The other side of the argument happens every effing time.  You can't just let Heather have her little story and her opinion about the death penalty.  You have to have someone jumping to their phone to give the other side.  Go ahead, Derek.  Hey, what's going on, guys?  Hey, man.  Hey, I just wanted to comment on the death penalty.  Yeah.  Yeah.  That you guys are talking about way worse, man, to stay in jail.  Never let the inmates take care of them.  They don't, though.  But they don't take care of them. 
[00:43:30]  We've talked to the guys that have been in the joint, and they go, you know what?  After a while, it becomes your life.  It becomes your life.  It's really not that bad.  Dude, if they...  Yeah, right.  After a while, at first, though, they would just torture them.  You know what I mean?  No, they do.  Derek, no.  They don't, though.  They don't torture you.  The guys who shot Malcolm X got out of jail, or the two of the guys that were accused apparently  weren't involved.  They didn't get killed in jail.  If they didn't get killed in jail, some guy shooting somebody in a home invasion is not  going to be killed in jail for them.  Yeah, but who cares if they get killed? 
[00:44:00]  They're still going to get tortured.  They're going to get raped.  No, they're not.  No, they're not.  It doesn't really happen like that.  Especially...  Everyone likes to think that prison's just like you see it in movies and that HBO show  there.  I freaking forgot.  Oz.  Oz, thank you.  You know what it is?  It's a day-to-day life in an institution.  Regardless that it's prison, but these guys become used to what they do.  They have a job.  They have friends.  They laugh.  They're able to talk with people, do activities. 
[00:44:30]  It just becomes what your life is.  Instead of being free, where you're on the outside going to work and talking with friends  and living your life, you're in prison in a restricted atmosphere, which that's supposed  to be the punishment part of it.  But the truth of the matter is, you're living your life.  You don't wake up every day going, oh, I'm in prison.  I'm in prison.  You do what you got to do. 
[00:45:00]  You don't think those people wake up every day thinking, wow, I can't believe I'm here.  Maybe it sucks, dude.  Nope.  You know who wakes up?  Because there's thugs most of these guys.  Right.  You know who wakes up thinking that?  Bankers.  When bankers go to jail, those guys have it rough.  Those guys get tortured.  But thugs, man, guys that are doing home invasions and shooting people, chances are they've been  doing crap like that for years.  And they're savage guys.  And they can handle jail because they know half the people there.  Yeah.  They know the mentality.  They're comfortable.  And their life on the outside wasn't much better. 
[00:45:30]  Yeah, it's been our experience talking to a lot of guys that have been in the joint that  it's not that bad.  Yep.  It's really not that bad after a while.  And they say it has happened to everybody.  Just about everybody that goes in there, it happens to them.  I've never done myself.  But this stuff does happen, whether you guys like to admit it or not.  The people that I talk to that have been in federal prison and state prison, it happens.  It's not that dude.  They walk out of there.  Even the ones that aren't in there for life walk out of there with a loose screw in their  head.  All right, Derek, hold on to the line for a second. 
[00:46:00]  We got Mike that wants to talk to you.  Mike, you're on with Derek from Massachusetts.  What's up, Alan?  Hey.  What up, dude?  These people don't understand until one of their loved ones gets killed.  Okay?  Then they'll want the death penalty.  Then they'll want to put a bullet in their head.  I would put a bullet.  Man, I feel so bad, brother.  I wish they would give her an AK-47 and as many rounds as she needs.  Don't kill them.  Just keep shooting them until you're satisfied.  Absolutely.  I hear you.  All right, let me ask you this. 
[00:46:30]  If Osama bin Laden got caught, right, and he went to jail, would you want him to get  the death penalty?  Dead!  Absolutely not.  Not only would the corrections officers take care of him, but those police would absolutely  take care of him.  Oh, brother.  You're wrong.  You're wrong.  The Ramsey guy, Ramsey Yousef, I think the guy that bombed the Trade Center in 93 is alive.  Yeah.  These guys live in jail.  Or that Sheikh Rachman, or hold on, hold on, dude.  That Sheikh Rachman, the blonde guy, whatever, who's Lynn Stewart's his lawyer, he was sending 
[00:47:00]  messages to his followers through that disgusting pig lawyer.  Yeah, why isn't he dead?  So he was living and thriving in jail.  You know, Scott Peterson, when he went to jail, he tried talking to people and everything.  They had to put him in PC for protective cover.  Because he killed his pregnant wife.  There's a difference.  There's a difference.  You're right, yeah.  There's a difference.  Hold on, we got a guy that just got out.  He did seven years.  Pete from Long Island, you're on with Derek.  What's up, Pete?  Yeah, listen.  All right.  Guys who come up north that are in that state of mind or things like that, when you get 
[00:47:30]  into the cage and the COC paperwork and they know what you came up for, they turn their  back.  All right?  They let you in the cage and so-and-so.  And I guarantee you, guys have gone back to their blocks lumped up like you've never  seen before in your life.  Yeah, I'm sure you're right.  I knew a guy who was a CO on Rikers.  And he was like a captain of the guards at one point.  And there's brutality.  But a lot of these guys that go there are brutal guys themselves.  Yeah, they're probably getting thrown beatings on the outside, too.  And they give beatings. 
[00:48:00]  And giving beatings, yeah.  When you get inside, it doesn't matter.  Once they put that tag on you, and you're known throughout the jail as a rapist, a baby  killer, or anything like that.  All right, right.  Yes, we understand.  No, actual crimes are different.  Hold on, hold on, Pete.  I understand that.  Hold on, hold on, Pete.  Pete, I understand that.  I got to ask you a question.  Did you hear Heather's story about 15 minutes ago?  No.  Actually, guys, I just turned you on.  I'm on my way.  All right, listen to me.  Listen to me.  So the guy, it's a home invasion.  The one guy was going to rape this girl. 
[00:48:30]  The boyfriend started running to protect her.  He gets shot and killed.  What happens to a guy like that in prison?  He's done.  No, he's not.  No, he's not.  Why is he done?  You're wrong.  Why is he done when he wasn't?  If he's a white guy, if he's a white guy, he's going to have to join the Muslims.  If he's a white guy, that's the only way to say he'll have any protection.  He'll join the Aryans.  And first of all, we didn't know if it was a rape.  The Aryans ain't shit.  The Aryans aren't anything, bro.  Hold on.  Even the hint of a rape, man, he's over. 
[00:49:00]  It's over.  That guy is screwed.  I didn't even hear that.  You are both deluded idealists and deluded.  I know you did time and I didn't.  I'm telling you, it wasn't like he was raping her.  It was a home invasion.  They were looking for drugs.  She went to run.  He grabbed her and he was hitting her.  She thought she might be getting raped.  That's why she ran.  It wasn't like he was in the middle of raping her.  I'm telling you, unless the guy is weak, but if he's a strong guy, he's going to do fine in jail.  He killed someone during a robbery.  It doesn't even matter.  It doesn't even matter how big they are because they gang up on you.  Okay, you're right. 
[00:49:30]  That's your excuse for the death penalty.  The man's going to get beaten up forever because gangs and stuff, they kill each other all the time.  There's people in gang shootings that spray bullets that kill innocent children.  They're not getting raped every two minutes.  It comes with that lifestyle.  Guys, it's not about getting raped, all right?  Listen, prison isn't about everybody trying to stick there.  You know what?  You know where.  Okay.  But we do have a little bit of a code that we live by, all right?  Baby rapists.  Yes.  We know.  We're agreeing with that, dummy. 
[00:50:00]  We're educated here.  If some guy shoots another guy during a home invasion, they don't care in prison.  They're not going to be like, wow, we shot a guy during a home invasion.  Let's punch him in the face and kick his ass.  Let's get him in the shower.  It's not going to happen.  He's just going to be another guy in there for murder.  Right.  They have with the shanks, the metal picks they have and everything.  So you're against the death penalty.  Why don't you just say this?  You're against the death penalty, and you're trying to justify why you're against the death penalty. 
[00:50:30]  You're going to over-argue the prison thing.  I'm not against the death penalty.  Okay.  I just think it's a lot worse to be in jail for the rest of your life.  For me and you, yeah, dude.  You're going to have 30 seconds of lethal injection in your blood system.  You know what, though?  It's the whole lead-up.  It's up to the family, too.  And the family knows that you're no longer speaking to any of your relatives.  The family knows you're gone.  I'd imagine the family's a lot happier knowing this person is off the earth,  and they don't have to wonder what he's doing in prison at that very moment.  I understand that, but, you know, they need to think of it. 
[00:51:00]  It is a lot worse to sit there and think about what you did.  You don't think some of these people that are in prison think about what they did?  Maybe some.  Some do.  Some don't, dude.  But the first time, like, someone's in prison and you know they're enjoying something,  that's got to drive you nuts.  Who cares if they think about what they did?  That's not an issue.  The bottom line is there are some people that behave like roaches, and they should be stepped on.  And when you break into someone else's house and beat their girlfriend with the butt of a gun and shoot them,  you deserve to be killed by the state. 
[00:51:30]  I mean, yeah, absolutely.  I agree.  It's either or, but I just think it's worth it.  I'll talk to you guys.  I'll give a shout-out to Mark Stiles, man.  See you at work.  All right.  Thank you, Derek.  See you at work, Mark.  It goes down to a shout-out.  It comes down to a shout-out.  A shout-out.  Look, another call from the Carolinas, South Carolina today.  Jeremy, what's up?  Hey.  What's going on, guys?  I was just calling in and responding to that guy.  That's a lie.  I mean, most of the time in prison, I've been working here now about two and a half years in a North Carolina correctional facility.  I mean, most of the child rapists and everything, they walk around just fine. 
[00:52:00]  I mean, you've got people's family out there.  They killed.  It's wrong.  They really need to implement the death penalty because to house an inmate, it costs more than we get paid a year.  I like the way you talk, too.  Poor little feller.  You're just a boy.  You shouldn't be in prison.  It's a bit loud.  Thank you, Jeremy.  I mean, wow, that got the phones.  It's a bit loud.  Potty meat.  Potty meat.  Tony, Michigan, what's up?  Hey, boys.  We keep it real on this show, right? 
[00:52:30]  We try to.  Yeah, and I appreciate you guys for that, and I've got to throw myself under the bus.  Man, I went to jail as a young guy, about 21 years old, young, good-looking guy, for a crime against a child.  It wasn't anything sexual or anything like that.  But a kid got hurt.  I was supposed to have been watching.  Dude, nothing happened.  Whoa, whoa, whoa.  Hold on.  Let's slow down.  What happened to the kid that you were supposed to prevent?  We don't know you.  My girlfriend's kid got burned in a tub with water. 
[00:53:00]  Uh-oh.  Did you do it?  No, I didn't do it, man.  Well, you didn't do it.  How did it happen?  How did that happen?  All right, do you know those cheap, flimsy hoses that you buy that you throw up where the showerhead's supposed to be?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  It cost like $2, and this was back, I'm 39 now, same age as little Jim.  But I was 21.  No, I was 19 at the time.  I didn't go to jail until I was 21.  So it cost probably $2.  Anyway, he went in there, and he turned the water on, and the thing popped off, and he got second-degree burns on his body. 
[00:53:30]  They didn't punish Rain Man for that.  And what I want to know is, how did you go to jail for it?  They thought you were punishing the child?  Well, it was in Virginia, white girl, white kid, blonde hair, blue eyes, black guy.  I don't know if that matters or anything, but it was just...  Well, did she want you prosecuted?  No, no, no.  She went to jail in my...  She went to court in my defense.  I'm getting all nervous now, and I've called a show before.  Oh.  So you went to jail. 
[00:54:00]  Well, what'd they say, that you abused the kid?  Exactly.  Well, they kept trying to get me to cop to it, and after they couldn't pin anything on me,  I pled no contest to willful neglect, which pretty much meant I was supposed to have been watching them, and I wasn't.  Right.  Okay.  Stupid kids.  I really was a halfway decent-looking kid, and I was young, and there was a crime against the kid,  and they said, if you go to jail for something against a woman or a kid, that's your butt.  Well, none of that happened. 
[00:54:30]  How long did you do?  I was in there about a week.  I think I was supposed to have done 14 days.  Dude, a week.  Hold on.  All right, listen.  We're talking about prison.  You were probably in a minimum security institution.  You weren't in a maximum security federal institution where they know you raped a child.  You were just a bad babysitter.  Yeah.  You did a weekend in county, man.  Get off our phones.  No one gets raped after a week.  Get off our phones.  Believe me, my ass, if you saw it, it's not even gay to want my ass.  It's so soft and supple. 
[00:55:00]  I would do okay for a week.  Freaking guy did a long weekend in county, and then maybe had to pick up some garbage on the side of the road for a few hours.  Get off our show.  Him and boy George were cleaning up garbage together on the side of the West Side Highway.  He made it sound like he would have been a star in Oz or something.  What the hell, bro?  Good-looking guy.  Good-looking guy when I went in for the weekend, and by the time I came out Monday afternoon, I aged 10 years.  Here's Louis in New York. 
[00:55:30]  Louis, what's up?  What's going on, guys?  Hey.  I love the show.  Thank you, sir.  Hey, listen, man.  Those guys have called up before.  They're saying that they're like, oh, you know, they're going to get raped.  They're going to get this.  They're going to get that.  You know, my father, all right, no names.  I'm not speaking of no names.  He's one of the head leaders from Latin Kings.  He's living like a king.  No one can touch him.  No one can do anything to him.  I got locked up in upstate New York because, you know, my name came out to be in the records, you know, as his son. 
[00:56:00]  You know, I did like, you know, half a year, six months, and then I was out.  You know, I was in Jubies, in and out of Jubies, just because of it.  You know, I visited my father, and, man, he's in there.  Not even wearing a uniform.  He doesn't even wear a uniform.  All righty.  Well, the gangs, I think, gangs like, gang guys like that are kind of like mob guys in the sense that, I mean, they're obviously, there's money being probably handed to guards and stuff like that.  And they'll look the other way.  I mean, you give them enough money.  More importantly, Lewis, do the Latin kings find us funny? 
[00:56:30]  Oh, please, please, please, please, please find us funny.  All right, Lewis, thank you.  No problem, boss.  By the way, look at all the people that are calling that used to be in jail.  Could you guys chill out, man?  Madison Avenue is listening right now.  This is not good for our audience.  No.  I know.  It's like the new advertisers for the O&A show are going to be like, oh, good.  Nice demo they got.  Yeah, exactly.  You know, locked underwear. 
[00:57:00]  Just things that can't be torn down in a violent assault.  God, we talk about politics, and there's crickets on the phones.  But look at this.  Look at this.  You want a few more of these or what?  Yeah, I love these guys.  All right, let's go to Sing Sing.  Joe did six years.  Sing Sing?  Well, Joe did six years in Sing Sing.  It's Joe from Long Island.  Joe.  What's up, guys?  How you doing?  What was your crime, Joe?  Hey, before you tell the crime, is there like a prison pride?  Do you have like prison pride?  Like, wow, I was in Sing Sing.  That's kind of a name prison that everyone knows.  No, not really.  I'm not too proud of what I did. 
[00:57:30]  Well, no, but I'm just thinking if you have to go to jail, you want to be drafted by the  biggies.  Yeah, the big leagues.  Like Rikers, Sing Sing.  Sing Sing.  Attica.  Attica.  Something like that.  You don't want to go to some institution no one's ever heard of.  Montgomery County Jail.  You know, I got a state pen because it was a federal charge.  Huh?  I got a state pen because it was a federal charge.  But just real quick, I wanted to call in regards to that guy that was saying about the  Aryan race that they're nothing in the jails. 
[00:58:00]  Yeah.  They're actually the smallest group, but they control the drug trade.  That's why they're the most powerful.  Yeah, there's the...  Go ahead.  I'm sorry.  I just wanted to let you guys know.  I'm actually going to work, guys.  I got to get out.  Okay.  All right.  Thank you.  Let's go to John in Boston listening on BCN.  John, what's up?  Hey, how's it going?  Hey.  Hey, that guy, I hope he didn't leave his real frigging name talking about that.  Which guy?  The guy who was just talking about the AB.  What?  The Aryan Brotherhood. 
[00:58:30]  Well, the guy, this guy who just called you said that they're small, but they're a pretty  powerful group.  Well, yeah.  I don't even want to talk about them.  That's all right.  But I didn't...  Why?  They're like any other group.  Why wouldn't you talk about them?  They're not trashing them.  Yeah, but you still don't want to, you know, it's kind of like dry snitching, you know?  Dude, we talk about every group in here.  We talk about the mob.  Why not talk about them?  We talk about, you know, nice groups.  Yeah.  We don't, you know, bash them.  Yeah.  Everyone's got a right to do whatever you want. 
[00:59:00]  Believe me, I'm a white guy.  If I go to jail, I'm going to be Aryan Jim because the blacks won't have me and I don't  want to hook up with the Latins because I don't speak Spanish.  They'd probably be making fun of me and trashing me and planning on raping me and I wouldn't  understand a word of it.  I'd be like, we playing cards tonight, boys?  Face down in the pillow.  Jimmy, you should probably kill yourself first.  I probably would, sir.  I was kind of, sorry, just trying to be humorous, but go right ahead with your serious tone.  Go ahead.  Go ahead, John.  I didn't mean to interject a little humor into the comedy show.  Go right ahead, sir.  Yeah, I was saying, you know, even bums in the wintertime, they go to jail just to 
[00:59:30]  get out of the cold and get three square meals a day.  It's not that bad once you get in there.  I mean, it sucks out of your family and everything.  It's not that bad.  It's not that bad.  You can get used to it.  Some of those guys, they know they're going back.  People get used to anything is what it is.  They get used to it.  They're in there.  It's their life.  People get used to their lives.  I'd rather have them die.  And everybody's so brave when it's not you being strapped to a gurney and having that  juice put in your arm.  Maybe for that minute that you're falling asleep, it's not that bad. 
[01:00:00]  But for the years and then months and then weeks and days leading up to the fact that  you are going to be put to death, that's got to be pretty torturous to somebody.  And when it comes time to get that fluid pumped into you, that's beautiful, good.  And then the end result, they're gone.  They're not on the face of the earth anymore.  I love it.  I love the death penalty. 
[01:00:30]  All right.  Thank you, sir.  Let's go to Mark in Indiana.  Mark, what's up?  Hey, guys.  I was a sergeant in a state prison in Indiana for about five years.  For the last two years, I ran the maximum security unit in there.  And let me tell you, these guys, I don't care what anybody says.  If they go to prison, they've got it made.  It's a cakewalk for them anymore.  They've got everything given to them.  So the death penalty is the only way to go for a lot of these guys, man. 
[01:01:00]  We're supporting way too many of them.  That's it.  Exactly.  All right.  And one more, and then we'll try to find out.  There are guys that are heroes in there for what they did.  Let's go to Ohio.  Paul, what's up?  Hey, guys.  Hey.  I've been to prison in three states.  Now, I think y'all both are wrong.  Both sides of the wrong.  First of all, you are right about a murder.  Nothing's going to happen to him.  Matter of fact, child molesters, nothing's going to happen to him.  That sergeant just spoke.  He's totally right.  Everybody's taken care of.  Everybody's protected. 
[01:01:30]  If you have an out date, you know, a day you're planning on paroling, you don't want  to beat up some child molester or some murder or whatever and get a new case more time.  On the other side of it, I've been in prison three times, three states.  As long as I have an out date, I have something to look forward to.  I have a day to go home.  If I was told I was going to do life in prison, I would rather die.  You know, the loneliness is just such a killer unless you know there's a time you're coming 
[01:02:00]  home.  Well, my girlfriend and I went to Alcatraz when I was out in San Francisco.  You went?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  How cool is that?  It was really great.  Thank you, Paul.  And we see the jail cells.  They were claustrophobically small.  I mean, obviously, you're in an Alcatraz run cell alone, which I would prefer.  Sure.  I'd much rather be in a cell alone.  I'm worried about that every night.  That's an awful way to live.  Did you take the audio tour, Jimmy?  Yes, it was great.  Wasn't it interesting?  They said the one thing that really got to these guys was the fact that sailboats and 
[01:02:30]  really nice boats would just kind of sail around.  Oh, man, they've got to watch it.  Having a good time and you're sitting in this jail, you know, that drove them nuts because  they could see what they were missing.  And then they said at night they could hear the yacht club.  They said especially on New Year's Eve because there was so much laughter.  If the wind was blowing right, you could actually hear laughs because the wind would carry.  From the yacht club and stuff.  Yeah, from San Francisco.  And they said that was torture.  Yeah, it was torture these guys because they were reminded all the time what they were  missing.  You know, you could hear like, you know, loving couples having a nice night at the yacht club 
[01:03:00]  and you're in your cold cell with the wind blowing right through your cell and you were  hearing the sounds of joy, I guess.  And that drove them nuts.  Yeah, that would be uncomfortable.  I got a picture.  I got a bunch of pictures in Alcatraz.  It was cool, man.  The audio, they show where Frank Morris' cell was, you know, who Eastwood played escape from  Alcatraz and I went to the library.  Did they show like where he kind of got out of and the little vent?  Yeah, you can see where it's all chipped out.  You see where it's chipped out.  That's pretty cool. 
[01:03:30]  And then from the side, when Alcatraz, when they escaped, they went through these vents,  they chipped through the vents and they went into these areas in between the cells and  then climbed up to the top of the cell house.  But they now have a glass partition where you can look and see down lengthwise the little  area in between the cells, because the cells are back to back, if that makes any sense.  Yeah, totally.  I've seen the movie.  It's very cool.  Yeah, Alcatraz, man.  I highly recommend that tour.  Most tours when you're on like vacation suck.  Well, this is done by all guards.  The Alcatraz one is great, huh?  It's done by guys who did time there, because they're all very old men, and it's done by 
[01:04:00]  guys that were guards.  So you're hearing people that actually lived on Alcatraz, really.  And you take a little furry boat out there.  It's really, really cool, man.  That is a cool one.  I hate all that tourist trap crap, but that one is a really cool one.  I have my picture taken on the steps where Clint Eastwood in English had a very spirited  discussion.  There's two reasons why you didn't sit on my step.  So I had to have my photo taken there for anyone that remembers the film.  In the yard there?  Yeah.  Isn't that wild?  Yeah.  All right.  We got to take a break. 
[01:04:30]  The phone's just lit with prison stories.  We got guys that worked in prison.  We got guys that went to prison.  We got guys that are going to prison.  They're all waiting to talk to us.  Also, everyone's talking about Imus' return to the radio.  It's all over the freaking news today, man.  As it should be.  And we got his first break, so we got some audio for the people that might have missed  it just to see what he's saying today.  Chalk up one for Whitey.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Screw the ****.  I'm back on the air, baby.  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. 
[01:05:00]  They showed the lineup, and it was, wow, a lot of black people now on Imus' panel.  I thought there was, I thought he hired a black comedian, right?  Kareth Foster.  I haven't seen her.  I know her for many years.  I haven't seen her.  But then there was another guy, and another guy.  It was just, it was just like they.  Really?  Yeah.  Well, Rob Bartlett.  Rob Bartlett.  Rob Bartlett.  Was Robin Blackface?  That would have been appropriate.  Yeah, he did as Al Jolson.  Yeah, no, he was, he was just sitting there in his suit. 
[01:05:30]  Really?  Yeah.  I think he was dressed up as Clinton today.  Oh, was he?  Yeah, so we got Imus' first break, just in case you missed it.  We'll do that next.  We also have Jeffrey Ross coming in, and Ken Burns is coming in today, huh?  Yes.  Ken Burns is pretty cool.  He did the Civil War documentary, and now The War, the big World War II documentary.  I got, I got the book right here.  I want him to sign it.  I'm not asking him to sign anything.  No.  Why?  I lied.  It's, uh, it's Opie and Anthony. 
[01:06:00]  Hello, everyone.  This is Bill Burr.  How you doing?  I'm going to be in, uh, Cleveland, Ohio at Hilarity's Comedy Club from December 13th through  the 16th.

[01:06:30]  Please come down.  Thank you.  Like the Super Trooper lights are going to find me, shining like the sun, smiling, having  fun, feeling like a number one.  Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony.  It's the Opie and Anthony Show.  This show is flying by today. 
[01:07:00]  Very, very busy, man.  We love phone calls from our listeners.  More phone calls on the Opie and Anthony Show.  877-212-O-N-A.  I mean, we got a ton of guys that did time in jail.  But we got our first woman, Amanda.  Amanda from Sayreville.  I'm hoping it'll be Linda Blair.  Amanda.  Caged Heath.  Hey.  You were in a women's prison? 
[01:07:30]  Yeah, I was in the women's prison in Clinton, New Jersey.  Okay.  For what?  For theft.  Theft?  Were we a shoplifting?  No.  I had stolen like about $80,000 from my job.  What was the scheme?  Toothpicks.  I was like an auto salvage, I don't, I was an auto salvage yard and they only accepted  cash or money orders, so, and I did a lot of the bookkeeping, so if they handed in the 
[01:08:00]  money, I kind of pocketed it.  I love, I love this whole thing.  I love how this comes together.  When was the first time you did it and what made you think, like, hey, I could get away  with this?  Hey, this is kind of cool.  Yeah.  I just took a, I just took $200 and no one knew.  Yeah, no one knew.  This is great.  Then you get greedy, right?  That's what it comes to.  Yeah, then I got greedy.  I got greedy.  I was getting away with it for like 10 months.  What was the first, what was the first one you did? 
[01:08:30]  It was about 500.  500 bucks.  So, what were you thinking, were you thinking like, you know, I keep track of the books.  This is cash.  Let me just take it.  How did you think you were going to get away with it, though?  Like, wouldn't somebody add it up at the end of the year?  Yeah.  Well, that's, I was gone by then, so that's when they kind of caught on, and that's, by  then I already left.  How did you get caught?  Well, I was dating the boss's son, so he was always kind of like, where are you getting 
[01:09:00]  this money from?  Where are you getting this money from?  Your dad?  Yeah, I was doing, and he kind of mentioned son to the father, and that's kind of, I  got started getting questioned.  I was denying it, but by then I already quit, so.  So now you got arrested.  Well, can I stop for a second?  Because I'm just thinking, like, she's dating the son. 
[01:09:30]  She's ripping off the son's father.  They're getting suspicious.  I think at that point, Amanda's giving up everything.  Yeah.  Sexually, she's like, oh, my God, right?  That's right.  Front, back, ears, eyes, socks.  Whatever you need.  Whatever you want to do to me, man.  Oh, crap.  Baby, I love your nose.  Here, it's only yours.  What I wanted to say was that some of the girls, you know, they're, you know, the one, do you 
[01:10:00]  guys remember the woman in Camden that starved the children?  Oh, yeah.  She lived on the same wing as me, and, you know, when you first come in there, you're  pretty poor, and if you don't have family members that help you out with money, you basically  live on the state food, you know, for breakfast, lunch, and dinner, and the women that worked  in the kitchen used to wait for her to come through the window because, like, it was just  like a hole in a wall where you get your trays, and they would only throw her a carrot or 
[01:10:30]  a celery stick.  You know, they were starting to starve her, and then another woman waited for her in the  showers and beat the crap out of her.  Oh, in the showers.  What happened in the women's prison, you know, when they, you know, especially when it came  to children, they didn't play around when you were one of those people that harmed children.  Amanda, how much time did you do?  Three years.  Three years.  Wow.  Three years for how much money? 
[01:11:00]  $80,000.  About $80,000.  $80,000, and it was your first offense?  Yes.  How did you do three years?  Well, I did most of my time in a halfway house, but I did about a year.  I hate those.  I hope that the roof was a half.  It's just a floor.  About a year on state ground.  Amanda, chained heat.  Any of that chained heat stuff happened to you, or did you see it happen in the  of the joint?  What was that?  Chained heat.  Lesbian stuff.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  That happened all the time. 
[01:11:30]  Oh, wow.  Oh, yeah?  All right.  There were girls in there that looked like guys, and I guess that's what some of them  got turned on by.  So you got to see a lot of action?  Were you involved in any of this action?  No, no, no.  Three years?  You were, what, celibate for three years?  Didn't do anything?  Oh, no, no.  I had a girlfriend in there, but I didn't get in any of that, like, foursome, fivesome that  used to go home.  Wait, no, no, but you had a girlfriend?  Yeah.  Were you a lesbian going into the joint?  Yeah, yeah. 
[01:12:00]  Oh, so you were bisexual then, because you were seeing the boss's son there.  Right.  Now, all this hot stuff we see in prison movies, is it as hot in person when you're checking  it out?  Sometimes it could get pretty nasty, but other times it was all right.  Now, how did you get to see your girlfriend?  Was she a, like, cellmate or something?  Well, she was in the same pod as me, so it was divided up in wings. 
[01:12:30]  She just lived on the other side, and I lived on the, like, there was a north and south side.  She lived on the south side, I lived on the north side.  So how did you get together to hook up and, you know, do what you do?  Well, some of the corrections officers there were, you know, were cool, and they let you  But they were.  Yeah, they let your girlfriend come on the other side.  And what would they kind of watch?  As long as you didn't take advantage.  Would they watch?  No, no, no, they wouldn't watch. 
[01:13:00]  Oh, that means you were ugly.  Did any of the male...  Did any of them watch?  Did any of them...  That hit me as I was talking.  Did any of the male guards have sex with the girls?  Yes, yes.  Cool.  That happened.  As it should.  Yeah.  All right, Amanda, thanks for sharing, man.  All right, sir.  Can I brag about something?  It's a hot prison story.  Yes, sir.  My girlfriend and I had sex last night.  Ah, congrats.  Can I say that I banged her so well...  Yeah.  ...that afterwards she cried? 
[01:13:30]  No.  We had cry sex.  She cried?  Wow.  Yeah.  Because of the emotions?  Emotions, yeah.  Oh.  You sure it was emotions?  I...  Doesn't she usually cry because...  Yes, because it's awful.  Like, she's like, what have I trapped myself in?  But no, no, this was a good one.  And she was looking at me the whole time.  I'm like, you were looking at me like you had pity for me.  It was killing me.  Wow.  I had this zoned out look on her face.  Wow, you turned it all around there, Jimmy.  That was a good hurt.  You really...  Jimmy's a stud.  ...made her feel good. 
[01:14:00]  Well, it's all, again, foreplay.  You know, we had a good 25, 30 minutes of foreplay.  Ah, see, that's very good.  I was very filthy.  Good boy.  And she wept.  I was like, good.  Cry.  Cry.  Good cry.  Think about what happened.  Yeah, baby.  You're a braggart.  Now clean this up!  Very good.  Hey, Ken Burns is here.  We got Jeffrey Ross.  They're both here.  And we got to play some of this Imus stuff real fast.  So we got Imus' first break.  He returned to radio today after, what, seven, eight months?  Almost eight months, right?  Wasn't it April? 
[01:14:30]  I don't know.  It was April.  So almost eight months, I guess.  Mm-hmm.  And this is how Imus started his show today.  I think what happened is about what should have happened.  About.  Ooh.  I think one has to realize, and I certainly do, that you don't get to decide, or should you,  how the news media is going to treat a remark you make, or the kind of remark I made. 
[01:15:00]  You don't get to decide whether they're going to put it in context.  Mm-hmm.  Well, he's got a point there.  Mm-hmm.  Yeah, we've been.  You really don't get to decide, no matter what.  We've been victims of that.  Yeah.  Not as bad as Imus, obviously, but.  Well.  He's being too kind to them, though.  You don't get to decide, and that's correct, but that doesn't change the fact that they're  disgusting, the media.  You know.  That doesn't change the fact that they're opportunist and dishonest.  Yeah.  Why is he giving the media so much credibility?  Well, I mean, he's making a point about. 
[01:15:30]  Well, he didn't really.  He just said.  He didn't give the reason why you don't get to decide, which is exactly what Jimmy just  laid out.  Which gives him a little credibility, in my opinion.  But you just don't get to decide.  Yeah.  And then he continued.  So around four o'clock that afternoon, I got a call from Les Moonves at CBS, and he  said, we can't take the pressure, and we're going to have to pull the plug.  And I said, I understood that.  And while I knew I wasn't still working for Mel Carmesan or Fareed Suleiman, Les Moonves could 
[01:16:00]  not have been more honorable and more straightforward and more decent and more honest in dealing  with me.  There was never at any point that he said, oh, everything's going to be fine or whatever.  We understood the gravity of the remark, we understood the consequences for the young  women at Rutgers, and we all recognized, and I certainly did, that it was just a matter 
[01:16:30]  of time before he did what he had to do.  How come he knew, like, right away they didn't tell him everything would be fine?  How come we always got that treatment?  Hey, don't worry about it.  Everything's going to be fine.  Get out.  Every time we messed up.  Please leave.  Every time we messed up in our careers, Anthony's exactly right there.  They always said, ah, don't worry about it.  I think it's going to blow up.  Remember this one?  Enjoy your weekend.  Yeah.  You'll be all right.  Just enjoy it. 
[01:17:00]  Everything's fine.  Don't be so paranoid.  Don't worry so much.  We'll get through this.  Yeah.  Oh, guys, things have changed a little bit.  Still don't, don't, there's a little pressure here, but.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Boy, listen to Imus, that non-bridge-burning guy.  Look at him.  Yeah, he's smart.  We should learn from him.  Everyone's wonderful.  Everyone's wonderful.  Reverend Al Sharpton's a fine gentleman. 
[01:17:30]  Even though he attempted to destroy my career, he's a wonderful person.  Exactly.  Well, Imus can't say it, but I will.  The fact that anyone who's protesting his return, like they did in Boston a little bit,  is disgusting.  Of course.  Shouldn't be protesting.  Let the guy work.  You read Jay-Z's article in Blender?  I did not.  Oh, man.  I got to bring that in for you guys.  What was it on?  He thinks Imus should have been fired and this and that, but it was such a double standard 
[01:18:00]  thing in this article.  I got to get the exact quote.  That's good that Jay-Z thinks that, though.  I'll bring it in tomorrow.  That's good.  Oh, you got it?  Of course I do.  You got the actual quote?  It's real.  Wow.  Sam, you're good.  You certainly is.  Sam knows black culture, huh?  Yeah.  I don't know why.  What is that about?  Amazing.  Comes running in with that.  But where's the whole thing, though?  Because then he explains why it's okay in rap because it's just entertainment.  And then I'm thinking, wow, that's kind of what Imus was doing at the time.  He was just trying to entertain.  Do you have that quote, too?  Yeah.  Here, why don't you highlight it?  You got a couple minutes to highlight it. 
[01:18:30]  More justification on why we as rappers can say what we want, but you as a white guy  can't.  It's a bunch of crap.  Look, if he believes Imus should be fired, you know, fine.  Fine.  But then he goes completely the other way and defends rappers.  Of course.  Just another phony.  How do you do that?  Rappers are turning out to be phony, man.  They're all supposed to be these guys that are gritty and just, like, you know, speaking  the truth as life is.  Legit.  And they can't wait.  They cannot wait to shut somebody else up.  It's amazing how fast they turn into, like, suburban wives with what's appropriate and what's 
[01:19:00]  not appropriate for people to hear.  Yeah.  Really irritating.  Sam's highlighting the good parts of that arc.  We'll have it in a second here.  I miscontinues this morning.  By the way, I wonder if he bought the Nets, if he'll have the same standards for his players,  like anybody with a drug bust can't be a part of the team.  Let's see if he has those high standards for his players.  And I had said earlier in the week in apologizing that I was a good person who had said a bad  thing. 
[01:19:30]  I realize I'm a bad person.  Who understated.  God, whatever.  We've been down this road a million times.  The whole country sucks.  A bunch of...  We just finished.  This racial dishonesty we have, you can't even make racial jokes anymore.  What a bunch of babies.  Panty wastes.  Ugh.  Okay.  I don't have a problem talking about censorship.  If we're going to talk about it with movies, if we're going to talk about it with video games,  if we're going to talk about it with all the pornography sites that are bigger than hip-hop, 
[01:20:00]  then I'm cool with people talking about it with hip-hop.  But to single out hip-hop and pull us into the ring with Don Imus, that's wrong.  It wasn't dealing with the real issue.  What Don Imus said was racist.  It wasn't about censorship, and it wasn't about free speech.  And it wasn't about rap's influence, because Don Imus is not influenced by rappers.  He's not a fan of rap.  I mean, he couldn't name Wu-Tang's first album.  That's good.  That's a good reason for him not to be able to say what he wants to.  That's good.  But you see...  There's another part to this, if you can find it.  Can I point out the error? 
[01:20:30]  Because he explains why it's okay for rappers.  Him saying that he's not influenced by rap, you see, he was saying something that was obviously young.  We've been over this a million times, but obviously black males, young black males, say what Imus said.  And that was kind of where the joke laid.  Like watching the old white lady dance to a black song.  Like, oh, look at the old gal dancing to a song she shouldn't be dancing to.  You see, that's the type of humor that is.  I mean, I'm not saying it's, you know, the best, but that's what that is.  Yeah.  All right, here's Imus again. 
[01:21:00]  And I had said earlier in the week in apologizing that I was a good person who had said a bad thing.  And I thought about how irrelevant that was.  Because whether you're a good person or not is completely unrelated.  It doesn't give you a license to make any kind of remark to you.  Imus, you've got the job.  You could shut up now. 
[01:21:30]  As much as I love Imus, can I disagree?  Being the good person is everything.  Your actions are everything.  Yeah.  You say something stupid and you're doing children's cancer charity work.  Yeah.  And perhaps you should be giving a break.  Disgusting Americans make your inappropriate remark bigger than your work with cancerous children.  That's everything what kind of person you are.  Exactly.  Your actions are everything.  That's like saying it doesn't matter what you do in your personal life.  If you say something nice, it's okay. 
[01:22:00]  So I can beat my wife, but be pleasant.  As long as you're saying the right thing.  Yeah.  Come on.  That's how it works in a court of law.  I'm going to say something, and I think this might catch on.  Actions speak louder than words.  No.  No.  I don't think that one will make any sense.  Damn it.  Actions can't speak.  That would look weird.  That would look weird on a t-shirt, Ant.  Yeah.  Their behaviors.  I thought I had a good saying.  By the way, Barry from Pittsburgh is pointing out a very obvious observation.  Imus is talking in a big empty room.  No. 
[01:22:30]  He's talking in front of a full house here in New York about 10, 12 blocks from here.  Town Hall.  Town Hall.  People want to hear what he has to say today.  They're on the edge of their seats listening.  That's how interesting.  And news people are there with their pencils.  They're just jotting.  Jotting down what he's saying.  They're trying to figure out how they can spin what he's saying today.  Well, a contrite, Don Imus, we saw this morning on the first installment of the new Imus in the Morning program. 
[01:23:00]  Really?  All right.  Here's how Jay-Z explains hip-hop.  You have to look at the people who are making the music and the areas that they come from.  On the whole, you're talking about kids who are 17, 18 years old coming out of bad neighborhoods.  They're angry.  They have issues.  And they're not mature yet.  You've got to let them grow.  You can't control anybody's art.  Exactly.  That is correct.  But, again, don't give Imus.  Find a reason to not give a white guy saying something racially inappropriate the same leeway. 
[01:23:30]  Who cares if they're 17?  That's irrelevant to me.  You want to have free speech?  Who cares?  Everyone wants to find a reason why certain people shouldn't be able to say certain things.  I think you should be allowed to F up, man.  To me, he didn't even F up.  Right.  I mean, Imus did nothing wrong.  I don't think he did anything wrong either.  But we're the only ones.  That's the weird part.  We're the only ones that just don't see it.  Here's the rest of what Imus was saying in that clip.  Remark you feel like making and doesn't minimize the impact it's going to have on who you make it about. 
[01:24:00]  And I realized that had I, had we been on the air and had we been talking about somebody else,  and had somebody else said that about something they said,  we would have made horrible fun of him.  I think they cut out his brain.  You damn bloody...  Well, Al.  Hey, uh...  Well, Al.  Let's just play the next clip.  I think the reason they accepted my apology is because I was able to place in context who I was. 
[01:24:30]  But more importantly, they, you know, they didn't think that I was saying they were prostitutes.  But they didn't think it was funny either.  And they don't think it's funny when I say it.  And they don't think it's funny when D.L. Huey says it or Damon Winans.  I mean, I appreciate both of those wonderful comedians trying to place in context the hypocrisy of how come they can say it and I can't. 
[01:25:00]  Can you point that out first?  None of us should say it.  Yeah.  You know what, Don?  There's certain white comedians that defended you on the same way, not just Damon Winans and D.L. Huey.  The Winans and D.L. Huey.  You know, there are certain white comics that went to bad for you, too, Don.  And pointed out the hypocrisy of Snoop and Whoopi Goldberg.  Wow.  But it's okay they didn't appreciate it.  That's what people don't understand.  It's okay. 
[01:25:30]  They didn't find it funny.  Well, that's all theirs.  I think 95% of the people that listen to this show don't find it funny.  Wait a minute.  No, most of the people that listen to this show found it hilarious and didn't think it was.  And finally, just a little bit more from Imus' first show.  It was demonstrated to these young women that there are consequences for things you say.  Would I rather have not gone through it and had them go through it?  Absolutely.  But as I said at the beginning of these few minutes, I think things worked out the way they should have worked out. 
[01:26:00]  We now have the opportunity to have a better program, to obviously diversify the cast.  I mean, that just makes sense.  But the program is not going to change.  We're just not going.  Hey, there's the crowd.  They were listening to every word, man.  It was a great radio program.  It was.  That's key.  It was. 
[01:26:30]  I think he'll be good.  And I love Imus, and he's doing what he's got to do.  I mean, he's not a dummy.  He's a bright guy.  Yeah, I'm sure they really discussed, all right, when I first get out there, what should I say?  And then, you know, they probably went through 50 people, this whole thing.  And then, all right, say this, say this, say this.  And then after a while, nah, you just get back to business as usual.  That's good that wonderful comedians like Damon Wyans and D.L. Hewley spoke up for him.  That's good.  That's good.  He did thank us later on, Jimmy. 
[01:27:00]  I'm sure he did.  That's terrific.  He did.  That's good.  All right.  We should take a break.  That's big news today, obviously.  Ken Burns is here.  We'll have him in next.  What is he promoting at?  The War.  Look at this book.  Wow.  The War, An Intimate History, 1941 and 1945, and The War, the documentary.  It's fantastic.  The book, the CD, and the DVD, all in stores now. 
[01:27:30]  Been waiting to talk to this guy for a while.  Just watching the Civil War, the documentary he did was amazing.  And this one is just fantastic, too.  The guy's really talented when it comes to documentary making.  All right, cool.  We've got Jeffrey Ross and Ken Burns next.  Stay there.  It's Opie and Anthony.  Boys and girls, sign up to be an Opie and Anthony intern today.  Whistle while you bury interns.  Do-da.  Do-da.  What the F?  Go to internships.xmradio.com and apply. 
[01:28:00]  Yeah, we've got to get right back into this.  It's the Opie and Anthony show.  In studio, Jeffrey Ross and Ken Burns.  Yes.  No, you don't have headphones?  Why would you?  He can't hear.  Ken Burns cannot hear.  Ken Burns can't hear.  Are you insane?  I've got music and no voices.  All the music?  No voices?  All right.  Is that better?  I'll turn down the music then.  How's that?  Nothing.  Nothing?  Why?  We're looking stupid in front of Ken Burns.  Why not?  No.  He's going to do a documentary on awful radio shows next. 
[01:28:30]  Yeah, right.  We'll be prominently featured.  Yeah, ears.  Oh, my God.  Comes in and points to the ears.  No.  Oh, no.  You don't have to fix his iPhones.  What are you doing?  If it's a comedian or an actor, who cares?  But it's a documentary filmmaker.  This guy's a respected documentary filmmaker.  That's it.  There we go.  Okay.  Ken Burns.  The War.  I watched it.  Fantastic. 
[01:29:00]  When I heard your name attached to it, I was like, this is great.  The Civil War was amazing.  I know people have, you know, over the years just given you much praise on that.  And I think it's because I've seen a lot of documentaries on the Civil War and World  War II, but you've taken that personal angle.  You take people's stories and incorporate it into it instead of just showing it for what  it is.  Where did you get that idea from?  Were you inspired by somebody or you just thought that would? 
[01:29:30]  You know, there have been thousands of documentaries on the Second World War.  You know, we actually do not need another documentary on the Second World War because there have been  so many.  But they're all distracted by a kind of a top-down view that focuses on celebrity generals and  politicians, on strategy and tactics, on weapons and army, all things Nazis, nothing  else.  And we thought, we're losing a thousand veterans a day.  You know, the war touched every family on every street in every town in America.  So there's, that effect is still going on right now. 
[01:30:00]  And so we thought if we did a bottom-up story, we took four, you know, darts on a map, four  geographically distributed towns, found out how they lived, what they did, and then sent  their men off to war.  Interested not in the good war that World War II has become, but the real war.  What was likely to be in combat?  You'd touch on something that was critical to it.  And the response has been, you know, unbelievable.  It's amazing because rarely in a documentary do you get so attached to, and I hate to use  the word characters because these are real people. 
[01:30:30]  You'll start a story out talking about a son that goes off to war, writing letters back  home.  The narrative will read the letters, and you don't know what's going to happen to this  person.  And then when you find out that the telegram came or the, you know, the clergy comes to  the door, it's devastating for the viewer.  You know, it's absolutely true.  We sort of paid lip service while we were working on it that the people that we would 
[01:31:00]  populate the film with would be so-called ordinary people that you get to know them like  somebody you might have had Thanksgiving with.  But that's exactly what's happened.  You know, when you deal with folks that aren't boldface names, when you deal with not a top  down but a bottom up version, these people become part of your life.  And I remember I was screening the film just before it was completely done done, before  it was broadcast, a whole bunch of warm bodies just to see what their response was.  And after the fifth episode where one of our fighter pilots had a really tough time and 
[01:31:30]  he wrote his girlfriend, you know, I live in a world of death.  It's really tough.  I meet out at the drinking fountain and she shakes her head.  She goes, whoa.  And I say, yeah, it's tough.  Middle-aged woman.  She goes, listen, you can tell me, does he make it?  Now, she's been watching this guy's interview.  She's been watching this guy, you know, he's clearly alive.  He's 80 years old.  And I said, but you've seen him.  And she goes, oh, yes, of course.  But she was so in the moment.  Yeah, yeah.  And, you know, that's the essence.  I think, you know, most of us, history is like castor oil. 
[01:32:00]  You know, it's homework.  It's not good tasting.  Um, but, but if it's really working, you, you tune in because you're not so sure it's  going to turn out the way you already know it did.  You know, I think you took lemons and made lemonade with that woman.  She was a dope.  I loved it though.  I thought we were home free.  I went back in.  I told all the other producers.  I said, man, we're, we've done it.  Cause if you're, if you're sitting there and you're so anxious that somebody that you see 
[01:32:30]  as an 80 year old man may not make it through because you so got into the story.  I thought that seems to be a problem, um, with, uh, with people.  They'd, I think you look at the 80 year old man and, and you're so set apart from what  he was and what that time was, uh, that you really can't relate to it.  Enough time has passed where you're like, all right, here's this young guy.  He's just a kid.  Uh, he's going off to the greatest war in the history of the planet. 
[01:33:00]  Uh, but you just, it's too far away.  It's black and white.  It's, it's, and the same thing happened with the civil war documentary.  It was that so long ago that it's, it's unrelatable, but your documentaries bring these people to  life and make them so relatable to the people, you know, your friends, the people you have  known.  That's, that's, that's our whole effort, which is the great arrogance of the present is that  we think that somehow cause we've survived, we know more, we're cooler, we're more sophisticated. 
[01:33:30]  We think better thoughts and every 18 year old, 19 year old, 20 year old, and that's who  goes to war in civil war or world war two.  That's who you have to recruit because they're the same idiots that drive their cars too fast  and spin over in the middle of the night.  They're the same idiots that listen to our radio programs.  It, you know, those, if you can remind people that even in the civil war, those teenagers  are the same people.  Are the same.  Yeah.  They had the, the, the thoughts, the dreams, the, the ideology.  And yeah, what, what amazed me about the civil war documentary is how well spoken these 
[01:34:00]  people were.  It, the letters were my dear Penelope.  I hope this letter finds you in good health.  And it's like, who, who the hell wrote like that?  Well, it was, they said about the civil wars, it was a war between the two most literate  armies ever to find.  And the whole idea, when you didn't have the internet, when you didn't have TV, when you  didn't have radio, you didn't have anything.  Xbox and all these distractions.  You actually, you actually learned how to write and it became important how you represented 
[01:34:30]  yourself just as how we represent ourselves in the way, the way we dress, the music we  listen to, some of the habits that we have.  It's no different.  It's just in that day and age, it was focused entirely on expression.  Because the letters would come out and they talk about this death and destruction of so  many people so eloquently and make these analogies that are just beautiful and brilliant.  But you know, it's interesting.  We just did a thing a month or two ago in Washington, D.C. where we had one of our guys, 
[01:35:00]  the fighter pilot.  We had a Vietnam vet who'd seen lots of combat and we'd seen an Iraqi war veteran just back,  just back.  And as they were talking, you felt like you were watching the grandson, the father, and  the grandfather.  I mean, they were the same person.  And at one point, the World War II guy, our guy, says, you know, I haven't told my son  this.  And the son was out in the audience and he begins to tear up.  He said, you know, I've gone to a Redskin game, every home game for the last 50 years. 
[01:35:30]  And when the Star Spangled Banner is playing before the game, I just go through, in my  mind, the faces of all my buddies that I miss.  Wow.  And he starts to cry.  And the Iraqi guy says, I feel like I'm an echo of you and you're an echo of me.  It's the same thing.  And when you see some of the letters that come back, they're now emails.  And moms will always, for as long as they're emails, press print, right?  And save them, yeah.  All these things and save them.  They have that articulation.  They don't maybe use the same flourish of language that you do back in the Civil War. 
[01:36:00]  But some of the letters, as you know, that we got back from World War II, guys are the  same thing.  So the impulse is the same.  You know, you just want to stay alive, keep your buddies alive, and just figure out some  way to deal with this horror that war is.  Do you find it surprising that, because one thing I find surprising, but then after you think  about it for a while, I guess not, a lot of these old vets from World War II, that emotion  is still there and comes out so easily. 
[01:36:30]  They can remember the faces of the friends that have died and how they died and the detail,  and they just break down a lot of times, and it's heartbreaking.  It's just wrenching to watch.  This is the key.  Like, we live in this consumer moment, and we're all focused on now, now, now.  If I just wear the right jeans, or drive the right car, or smell the right way, everything  will be all right.  But memory is not something that's 60 years ago.  Memory is something on your hard drive now.  So these guys might start off to answer a question that we ask, and not know that by 
[01:37:00]  the end of it, they'll have access to that and be in tears.  Because it's always right there.  And there's a guy who's lived a good life, he's not cuckoo, and his hand shakes almost  every morning from remembering that time 63 years ago when he's mowing down Germans  and cutting them in half and watching bodies fly in half from his fighter plane.  I mean, this is the reality of war.  And when you access that, not interested in all that other junk, the context, or the, 
[01:37:30]  you know, just what it was like to be in battle, then you have an opportunity to sort of be  present.  Faulkner said, the writer said, history is not was, but is.  You know, what does that mean?  Except when you watch a guy who, he's 82 years old, but all of a sudden he's not 82,  he's 18.  And all of a sudden, it's not yesterday, it's now.  And you can hear the thrum of the engine.  You can hear the bullets.  You can see that stuff happen. 
[01:38:00]  And that's a great gift when somebody, when somebody's able to deliver that.  Yeah.  And we'd hear, we'd hear a guy, you know, like family members sit in when we're doing  interviews and we still shoot films.  So every, you know, 12 minutes we change a role of film.  And, um, the, the greatest sound to my ears is always pop.  You never told us that.  You know, for years, for 60 years, the story of the battle of the bulge was, oh, we took  over a French farmhouse.  They had a wine cellar.  We all got drunk.  And that was the story. 
[01:38:30]  And I'm sure that happened.  But what he then tells you is, so it was the coldest winter ever.  My buddy was wounded.  And in the morning he was dead.  Rigor mortis had set in and I had to lift his body, stiff his cordwood and throw it in  the back of a flatbed truck.  And we found the footage.  We spent years in the National Archives.  Wow.  And found that footage.  May not have been him doing it, but something so similar that you realize you're there.  And all of a sudden the family's reeling because for them, dad's war experience was, you know,  and my buddies and we did this and here he is in the bottle of champagne and the French 
[01:39:00]  women.  And here's this horrible moment.  Here's this other also true story.  And that's what the book and the, and, and, and the film was trying to do was just get at  this intimate details of it so that it's no longer something that's homework or this distant  lesson to us, but something that's personal.  We realize that somebody that we know, our dads, my dad, an uncle, a grandpa went through  the same thing and there, but for the grace of God, I could be there.  I mean, I remember when I was 18 and 19 years old, I was wondering what my draft number was 
[01:39:30]  for Vietnam, you know?  What was the difference?  Uh, cause you watch some of that footage, uh, in, in your documentary.  It's just fantastic.  The, the spirit of the country and the people that were going off to war, uh, like we said,  a lot of these just young kids, but in droves and smiles on their faces.  And they, they, they wanted to go and do this.  And, and then when they did get there, the, the amount of, of, uh, camaraderie and bravery 
[01:40:00]  just from, like you said, these ordinary guys, when they're riding home, you know, it's again,  relatable as people that, you know, and went to school with or worked with, but then as  they're doing these things in these moments of, of terror, uh, you think to yourself, well,  there's no way I could ever do that.  How did he ever do that?  Who gets off that boat at Omaha?  Exactly.  Yeah.  When that drops its front down and that ramp comes down and who is getting off of that  and running into machine gun fire, he's not, he's not ending up with an empire at the end. 
[01:40:30]  No.  And, and, and his letters home weren't, Hey, I'm Mr. Brave guy.  It was a scared guy.  It was, you know, somebody that, like I said, you worked or went to school with where this  is, where did you find that that came from?  A lot of it is just the momentum of the time when everybody's doing it.  There's no way to resist it.  Almost in the opening of the film, some guy said, this is just a tide that carried us all  downstream and we were willing to do it.  And it wasn't just altruistic patriotism.  It was just staying alive, keeping my buddies alive, but participating in an adventure.  This is a way to be adult. 
[01:41:00]  You know, I can sign my name, he said, and all of a sudden I'm a submariner.  All of a sudden I'm a pilot.  All of a sudden I'm the guys I see in the movies.  Not just some kid packing groceries.  Exactly.  You know, pimply faced kid.  He's suddenly, you know, doing that.  But then you have to ask yourself, how does this happen?  One thing is it was shared sacrifice.  It's a paradox.  In shared sacrifice, we made ourselves richer.  Today we're all independent free agents.  We walk around.  We're not going to give up anything.  And yet we feel that poverty.  You know, we have a war going on, but it's fought by a professional class. 
[01:41:30]  It does all its suffering alone and apart from the rest of us.  We're told at 9-11 that the threat was as great as Hitler, but nobody asked us to do anything.  They said, go shopping.  I mean, if my president had said to me, my president said to me, here are 50 things I need you to give up or to do.  Everybody in the country would have done that.  Right.  And who knows where we'd be right now.  We may not have $3.50 oil, gas.  We may not have our bridges and our levies failing.  There were huge sacrifices made during World War II, and people got involved on the civilian front.  And it made us richer. 
[01:42:00]  That's the paradox.  Not just spiritually richer, we're all together on this, we're all in the same boat, but materially, financially richer.  We started off this impoverished country reeling from the Depression, and four years later, with the richest country on Earth,  and more than half the manufacturing in the entire world is taking place right here.  Do you find that a lot of the veterans, like, you know, you look at Vietnam vets, and I'm sure even some Iraq vets are very pissed off  because of the reason they were given it, because the way the war was dictated.  I'm sure there's a lot of bitterness. 
[01:42:30]  Did you find the same bitterness in World War II veterans that I think exists in a lot of guys from Vietnam or Iraq?  No, and it's different.  You know, I think with Iraq veterans, you find a variety of opinions politically about the war.  A lot of them are against it, but they're doing their duty.  I mean, this is the thing.  The luxury that we have to have the conversation this morning is because there are men and women  who are actually willing to not only fight the good wars, but the bad ones, too, you know?  And so there you have a whole range of political opinion among Iraqi vets about how it was.  Vietnam was even more complicated, and, of course, the country did not respond well to the soldiers. 
[01:43:00]  It's the worst thing we did in Vietnam is we treated them as if they were the villains,  when, in fact, they were the pawns in a situation in which the country was divided about whether we should be there or not.  So it's complicated.  The interesting thing about World War II veterans is they just don't want it soft-pedaled.  They don't want it.  I mean, I'm sitting here just over the weekend.  Somebody sent me all these responses, just regular letters from folks that came in. 
[01:43:30]  And they're saying, you know, snail mail.  They're saying, you know, I finally discovered my dad.  A veteran came up to me the other day at a book signing, tears streaming down his cheek.  He said, you know, I've waited all my life for someone to show it the way it actually was,  meaning not soft-soled, not John Wayne, but the horror of war.  And we felt going in, wouldn't it be better to honor them as they are reaching the sunset of their lives  by not sugarcoating it, by not draping it in the bloodless gallant myth of all of the clichés that we do about World War II times, 
[01:44:00]  but show that this isn't the good war.  This is, in fact, the worst war ever.  Nearly 60 million people died.  How could it be the good war?  Now, we know why that comes in, because the country wasn't torn the way we are now or were in Vietnam.  But at the same time, nearly 60 million people died.  And war is horrible.  It isn't like the movies where you get up, I'm going to go and take that machine gun nest,  and you get hit and you fall, you're suddenly sitting there and you turn around and your buddy doesn't have a head anymore. 
[01:44:30]  He's ripped apart.  Or his entrails are all over.  I mean, this is not pleasant things to talk about, but this is what happened and this is what we tried to honor.  And so the veterans, to a person, their anger is about, you know that old thing, Daddy, what'd you do in the war?  No one really wants to know the answer to that.  No one actually wants to know the real answer to that.  And that's why these guys came back and just shut up.  And so most of the letters I have are, my dad never talked about it, 
[01:45:00]  but I felt through your film and your book that we were able to find out what he did.  I now know my dad.  That's something that made a generation of people that were a little set apart from their fathers,  not really getting that closeness.  and it affected the generations down the line.  Oh, you do.  Absolutely.  You know what's interesting?  What we've found is sometimes the grandkids have a better way of prying open granddad than the sons did.  I mean, because it's always a complicated dynamic, but at the end of their lives, 
[01:45:30]  they've given a different kind of attention to the grandkids.  I mean, we know all what it's like with the grandkids.  And we know that there's a complicated dynamic going on between our parents and our grandparents  that we don't have with them.  And they're suddenly opening up.  So I'm finding grandkids coming to me and saying,  this is the memoir that I got my grandpa to do.  Or I got my DV camera and I was able to record him.  And we initiated this thing with the Veterans History Project at the Library of Congress.  And we're getting tens of thousands of kids to get their relatives on camera before they go. 
[01:46:00]  That's great.  I don't think you can have enough information from these people.  You can't have enough.  And you feel so great when they download this stuff to you.  I mean, it's horrible that sometimes...  I remember a woman came up to me and she said, there's a guy on our block.  Nobody liked him.  He was just a mean old cuss.  But I heard he was in the hospital and he didn't have any relatives.  So I thought, I'll go visit him.  So she goes into the hospital.  She spends three hours and he just starts telling her about these horrible war experiences. 
[01:46:30]  She said, I didn't know what to do.  He died an hour later.  So she's now stuck with his nightmare?  Yeah, right?  Wow.  She just...  He needed somebody to tell.  Jeffrey Ross.  You find that...  I mean, my experience from visiting wounded guys is they'll often open up to a stranger.  It seems to me that somebody wants to tell...  A soldier wants to tell their story.  Not necessarily right away.  Not necessarily to their mother or their father.  But they want a witness to their history. 
[01:47:00]  I agree.  You know, you understand completely why they shut up.  Because there's just no things to describe.  We form really wonderful relationships in a job like this, in college, in sports, you  know, intense relationships with siblings and with parents.  But the bonds that you forge in basic training and then in combat are unlike anything else.  I mean, the experience of war is...  It's a paradox because when your life is most threatened, you live life at its height.  And then you see things and experience things no human being should have to experience. 
[01:47:30]  And then you come home and you actually can't tell mom.  You can't tell pop.  You can't tell your brother.  You can't tell your best friend.  You left your best friend's arm and body over there.  So you lock it away in the safest, deepest resources of your psyche.  But then later on, you do have that impulse.  Who can you tell?  Who do you speak to?  And quite often, it's the stranger.  I mean, we'd find these guys...  We talked to more than 600 people to get the 40 for our film. 
[01:48:00]  Most of them couldn't talk about it.  One guy, we actually...  He said, oh, yeah, I can talk about it.  First question, tears.  Wow.  He was gone.  He was gone.  And as you see, a lot of these guys, it's so fascinating, are on the edge of telling you  incredible stuff.  And you're mesmerized.  I mean, I was screening the film early on, and a woman said to me, it's horrible.  Don't take out a single dead body.  I thought that was really good, you know, that it was something you had to...  One of my daughters, now 21, she was terrified of the vacuum cleaner when she was like one 
[01:48:30]  and two.  She would run from the room screaming.  And one day, the vacuum cleaner's going.  My wife has a vacuum cleaner.  And she just walks in and sits down on the vacuum cleaner.  And that's the way she abolished her fear.  And every once in a while...  I still have the fear of vacuum cleaners.  Maybe I should try that.  Oh, that really sucks.  No joke.  It goes right through me.  Ken Burns of the studio.  Band of Brothers, what did you think of that?  Loved it.  In fact, I think that Saving Private Ryan and Band of Brothers did an amazing thing, which  is it said, you know what?  Let's just not kid ourselves. 
[01:49:00]  War is hell, as Sherman said in the Civil War.  Let's just show what it's really like.  So that opening sequence of Saving Private Ryan, or a lot of those combat sequences of Band  of Brothers did something that other films hadn't really done before, which is put it  in your face.  When they did the airborne drop in Band of Brothers, it was just, oh my God, who's jumping  at it?  So my only thing is, it's just terrific.  And we worked with Tom Hanks, you know, who's the voice of Al McIntosh, the editor. 
[01:49:30]  He's been great as far as World War II vets and getting the memorial going.  He's carried this thing going about World War II that is so impressive.  And he does it really honorably.  Can you believe he was in Bosom Buddies?  Can you chill?  Really?  But now he's doing the Pacific War version of Band of Brothers.  And interestingly enough, they're focusing on several of the people that we've already  done as live.  And I just thought it was incumbent upon us documentary filmmakers. 
[01:50:00]  I mean, if you look at the History Channel, it's like, it's called the Hitler Channel.  Yes.  You know what I mean?  The big H in the corner.  They get distracted by those generals.  We thought we were the only ones that called it the Hitler Channel.  The Hitler Channel, every time you pass by it, it's like, ah, there he is.  You know, and you understand that there is this fascination about absolute pure evil.  But there's a problem that happens, that that fascination sometimes metastasizes into  a kind of respect for the Germans' early military successes and their superior weaponry.  They wear snappy dressers. 
[01:50:30]  And that's a slippery, slippery slope, you know?  And what we thought was, let's, let's go into the, you know, if you're, if you're a researcher  doing a film, you don't have that much time on the History Channel to spend, you can't  spend five years in the National Archives since we did.  Right.  You can only take the cream of the crop, which is good stuff.  But we were able to find the ounce.  We were able to find stuff that had been originally shot in color, but it had been made  black and white to make a newsreel uniform.  But all of a sudden, man, it's real.  And so there's stuff that, I don't know, I don't care who you are in our film that you 
[01:51:00]  look away from.  That is amazing, the difference between the black and white film and the color film.  How you're like, it makes it more real, it makes it more relatable.  Because we see everything in color now.  You don't watch black and white TV anymore.  Well, black and white is sort of an arty, sort of stylistic sort of thing that you do  in mixed media, you know, in Oliver Stone, a music video.  But we, for so long, that's how we got all our information about World War II, and that 
[01:51:30]  helped to keep it at arm's length.  Distance, definitely.  But all of a sudden, if that guy's coming at you and he's holding his face and it's  gushing red blood.  Yep.  It isn't just some dark something on his face.  Red blood.  Then all of a sudden, that's only one little step and it could be me.  And so this is what we try to do.  Bottom up, intimate.  I got to ask you something about your Civil War documentary.  When you had the idea, did people go, hey, crazy, there's no moving pictures from that  era. 
[01:52:00]  What are you insane?  That's exactly it.  Well, I started with my dad.  I remember I said, on Christmas Day in 1984, I said, my next film's going to be on the Civil  War.  He goes, oh, yeah, really, son?  What part?  And I said, all of it.  And he looked at me, walked out of the room like, my idiot son.  But I had made five or six films that were one hour, hour and a half in length with still  photographs and a couple of Academy Award nominations.  And they were respected.  But when I started proposing, it was originally going to be five one hours.  They said, nobody's going to watch this for five one hours. 
[01:52:30]  And then when I came back halfway through, okay, so it's going to be 11 and a half.  They just thought I was nuts.  And there was this one guy in public television, sort of a mentor, a guy named Ward Chamberlain,  who, incidentally, when we'd go out to dinner, he'd get a couple drinks in them.  He'd start talking about his time as an ambulance driver in Italy.  So I put him in the film.  He's in there in the film.  Oh, wow.  Talking about picking up dead bodies in Anzio or in the Amato Casino campaign.  Anyway, you know, he just went and fought the battles with me and we got it out. 
[01:53:00]  But no, nobody thought that.  The idea is that the word moving has lots of different meanings, right?  So a photograph may not move, but you can move inside that photograph.  And you can create emotional things in which there's apparent movement and there is emotion or movement of another.  You've heard about the Ken Burns effect that people...  Steve Jobs called me up, you know, about five, six years ago.  And he said, look, we've been perfecting this for a long time.  And we called it the Ken Burns effect. 
[01:53:30]  Yeah.  You know, it's going to go out on all these things.  It's amazing how you can take a photograph and look at the whole thing.  And then as a narrative is going on, slowly actually pan across the photograph to one person there.  And that's who you're talking about.  Actually, that tells a story.  It tells a story.  And the narrative was amazing.  The letters that were being read, amazing.  And then I forgot his name, but he had recently passed away. 
[01:54:00]  Shelby Foote.  Yes, just unbelievable the knowledge that this guy had.  I made a film on Huey Long, you know, in the mid-80s.  And I had interviewed Robert Penn Warren, who's a great poet laureate of the country.  He called me up on a year that I was doing the Civil War and told me, you've got to do Shelby Foote.  Now, on the bookcase that I was assembling of, you know, all the Civil War literature, he had this three-volume, 3,000-page thing.  And I said, okay, well, if Robert Penn Warren says.  So we went and interviewed Shelby Foote first, and it was, we didn't need anybody else. 
[01:54:30]  The voice, the whole speaking style he had, just amazing.  We definitely have to take a break.  We have a little more time with you, Ken.  You got me.  Because the phones are late.  We'll go to the phones next and continue with Ken Burns, who's the war, the book, the CD, the DVD is all in stores now, right?  And you're doing some book signing?  Yeah, I am.  And we got some Wednesday night, I'll tell you the details, and Friday night, all in Manhattan.  Wednesday, it's at the Borders at the Time Warner Center in Columbus Circle at 7 o'clock, right here in Manhattan. 
[01:55:00]  Friday at McNally and Robinson in Soho on Prince Street.  At 7 o'clock.  Yeah, it's been really great to do this.  I bet, yeah.  You can come up with hand trucks with 20 books and say, Christmas shopping done.  Yeah.  So, yeah, we'll continue after the break.  You've just got to promise us that we're not going to have, like, a pop quiz at the end of this.  Oh, all right.  No pop quiz, right?  I'm going to hand out the dittos.  Dittos.  Your worksheets.  Everybody remember the smell of dittos.  This is very interesting, but it's bringing me back to school.  I'm like, oh, no, we're going to be quizzed on this? 
[01:55:30]  Oh, no.  Oh, no.  All right, Ken Burns.  It's my homework.  More with him and Jeffrey Ross next.  It's Opie and Anthony.  You should do a documentary on rock and roll, Ken Burns.  Absolutely.  I used to run a record store in the late 60s in Ann Arbor, Michigan.  That was a good time to be in Ann Arbor, Michigan.  Yeah.  Five dollar marijuana law.  A parking ticket.  Wow.  I didn't know that.  Are there subjects that you just wouldn't be able to do a documentary on? 
[01:56:00]  Do you pick things that you're passionate about?  That's all it is.  If I were given a thousand years to live, I wouldn't run out of topics in American history  to do.  And it's not what you choose.  It's how you do it.  So in a way, I'm saying I'm making the same film over and over again, just sort of exploring  who we are and what we're about.  And it's what we were talking about in the break, is that even the people closest to us  remain sort of unknowable and inscrutable.  And that's a great, wonderful mystery.  I mean, so why do we do biography of other people when we don't even know our brothers 
[01:56:30]  or our mothers or our wives or our kids in a complete way?  It's just what human beings have to do.  That's so true.  I was reading some of the letters that you've been getting because of your documentary,  The War.  And one of the real common factors in a lot of the letters is the fact that these people  that have grown up with their fathers that went to war just didn't know anything about  what he went through until they watched this. 
[01:57:00]  And then they said they were crying and couldn't believe, you know, what they were seeing.  And it's just amazing that they lived with this person.  That's right.  You know, and did not know what lay beneath the surface.  And that just tells you, you know, what's available.  You know, you pass somebody on the street.  Who knows what the story...  I mean, the way we did this film was to honor the idea.  You drive down the interstate and there's that exit.  You maybe have passed that town a million times.  Well, what if you stopped and went into that town and started asking questions?  That's all we did.  And within just a few questions, we met people that are as heroic individuals as I've ever 
[01:57:30]  met, which tells me that it wasn't just the luck of the four towns that we picked, but  the fact that everywhere...  Oh, it could have been any four towns, yeah.  It could have been any four towns.  It could have been any 40 people who get to go.  And remember, these aren't just combat.  This is also folks at home.  So you get the intimacy of what it was like to worry.  Lots of women in this film.  And one of the stars of the film is Catherine Phillips from Mobile, Alabama, the only person  I know who can take the title of our film and turn it into three syllables.  Wall.  And it's an intimate thing. 
[01:58:00]  And what we were able to do in the series is give you one thing, and in the book is  expand it.  So we introduce you to some more people and expand their story in a way a book is able  to do.  A very compelling part of the documentary is the soldier that would write home like nothing  was wrong.  Nothing was wrong.  This is Babe Charlo of Waterbury, Connecticut.  You know, his mom, his brothers, his sister, they're all back in Waterbury.  And censorship didn't permit him to say exactly where he was or what was going on. 
[01:58:30]  And he didn't want to worry his mom.  His dad had passed away a few years before, and she was so anxious about him.  So he would write these letters.  And at first, when we got them, we thought, oh, no, what are we going to do?  There's nothing here.  But then we realized...  There's so much there.  He knew where he was.  So we could show footage of what he was going through the same day he was writing this letter  about, oh, man, I'm getting fat.  I'm a chow hound.  I must have...  We had pork chops tonight. 
[01:59:00]  And you know he's not getting pork chops because he's in the middle of Anzio.  And it's just hell.  It was called the largest self-sufficient prisoner of war camp in the world because we couldn't  get off the beach.  And the Germans had us pinned down for months, and they just rained shells down.  And it was just really God's will, whether the bomb landed over there and took you out  or landed over here and took me out.  Was he alive, the guy writing those letters?  He...  I don't want to give it away.  Yeah, don't give it away.  But it's a very, very compelling part of the documentary. 
[01:59:30]  So it's great.  So we suddenly realized we got his home movies.  We got his family's home movies.  We got the home movies from folks in Waterbury.  We can show that, but we can also show what's going on the day he's writing the letter where  we know his outfit is in.  And it's nothing like what he's describing.  So all of a sudden, you realize the love inherent in the lie.  Because how could you not want to say what's going on and what you're doing?  And you don't want to worry your family, but you kind of want to go, Jesus, I'm in hell 
[02:00:00]  right now.  I'm in hell right now.  But no, everything's fine.  Everything's fine.  Yeah, yeah.  I think I'm going to take a swim in the Iranian sea.  It's like, you know, April, you know, and you're going, this guy, the shells are landing  around there.  Guys are getting purple hearts when they're in the hospital being operated on because  the Germans are just bombing the hospitals and amazing.  Can I point out what a dope I was, by the way, to ask you just to like blow it by a,  well, so what finally happened at the end of the movie? 
[02:00:30]  Who's done it?  Who's done it?  Let me just help you out.  We win.  I'm sorry.  I didn't mean to ruin it for you.  But you know what?  One of the reasons why we did this was not just that we're losing a thousand veterans  a day, but I heard this statistic in the late nineties that said that an unbelievably large  number of graduating high school seniors think we fought with the Germans against the Russians.  Oh, I know.  I've read some of that.  We're trying to go, oh my God.  Isn't it amazing?  How is this possible? 
[02:01:00]  You know, that how, how do we bring up a generation of people for whom?  Dummies.  The biggest, the biggest man-made event in the history of humanity.  Mm-hmm.  We don't even know the basic ABC of it.  Never, let alone the XYZ of it, but the ABC of it.  Okay.  Yeah.  We fought with the Russians.  We're on our side with these people against the Germans.  That essential, basic fact.  So what lessons can we take away for this war?  What can we learn from your movie?  Well, I think there's a couple of things that we, you know, we didn't have a political agenda 
[02:01:30]  in this film.  If you watched any of it, we just wanted to bear witness to the testimony of these people  in battle.  So the first thing is we ought to, particularly in a democratic society, know what war is like  because we have not only the privilege, but the obligation to vote in the leaders who are  going to make the decisions, whether we go to war.  And we ought to be damn sure that the war we're in is a necessary war, which is the first  episode title of the war.  That was a necessary war. 
[02:02:00]  And if you know, not just as a mother, but as a citizen, what the cost of war is, what  it's really like in its interior moments, the stuff that nobody wants to show, then you  make decisions.  Let's only fight necessary wars.  That's the first thing.  The second thing is what we were talking about earlier, about shared sacrifice, that if you're  going to be in a war, let's do it together.  Let's make sure that everybody's willing to participate, to share, to sacrifice, and that  there isn't this separate military class fighting and suffering its losses apart and alone from 
[02:02:30]  the rest of us.  Because I've been traveling around the country for the last year, everywhere I go, ask how  many people know someone in Iraq?  If it's one or two percent, I'm surprised, you know, outside of a military community.  You know, back then, if a hand didn't go up, you were surprised that somebody wasn't engaged  in some way.  So if this is, as our government keeps telling us, as big a threat now as it was back then,  or even if it's half the threat, why aren't we all doing something every single day to 
[02:03:00]  not just support the troops, which is now a cliche, but to do stuff, you know, to pay  the higher gas tax or to do without this.  All the stuff we did that at the end of the day, at the end of the war, made us richer  and better and stronger country.  And that's what, you know, the historian Arthur Schlesinger Jr. who passed away a few months  ago was fond of saying, there's too much pluribus and not enough unum.  The Latin motto of the United States is, e pluribus unum, out of many, one.  So there is too much pluribus, many, and not enough unum.  And I realized when he said that, that all the films I've made, no matter what they were 
[02:03:30]  about, baseball, jazz, the Civil War, the war, the West, biographies of Thomas Jefferson  or Mark Twain, you know, it's about unum.  What is it that we all share in common, not that we're different?  Let's go to the phones here.  A lot of people want to get in and talk to Ken Burns.  It's Renee in Syracuse.  Renee, what's going on?  Hey.  Hi, Renee.  Hi, I am so thrilled to be able to talk to you guys. 
[02:04:00]  Ken, thank you so much.  I work for the local PBS station in Syracuse, WCNY.  Thank you very much.  Oh, my God.  We are just thrilled that you brought that documentary to PBS.  And we had so many calls, and I don't want to take up too much time, but I just would love  it to have you come to Syracuse and stop in and talk to people because so many.  Give him a tote bag?  What's that?  Will you give him a tote bag for a donation?  Of course he was going to bring it to PBS. 
[02:04:30]  I don't think MTV was in the running.  But we just want you to know that so many people in Central New York just were so grateful,  and so many stories came from that.  And I could go on and on.  It's been a pleasure listening to everything.  Thank you, R.I., Renee.  Thank you, Renee.  It's really, really great.  We've had a lot of response all around the country, and that's the only thing that makes  work.  And, of course, PBS is the only place to do it. 
[02:05:00]  No commercial interruption.  Yeah.  And, you know, it's sort of much maligned.  But we end up making the best science, the best nature, the best public affairs, the  best children's, the best arts, history.  I don't know if you like this or not, but you've kind of made the documentary a little  more mainstream than it used to be.  You know what?  The word documentary is such a poor world because it encompasses everything from, like,  the political advocacy of a Michael Moore or Morgan Spurlock's type of films, you know,  like Super Size.  That's true, yeah.  You've got Errol Morris' Fog of War, highly beautiful stylized things. 
[02:05:30]  Werner Herzog makes documentaries.  There's, you know, Cinema Verite.  There's all this different stuff.  What happened was is that the Civil War, when it came out, was sort of a watershed moment,  and people suddenly looked up, and we're getting tired.  You know, Hollywood, you know when the number one movie's like a third-rate TV show from  the 60s, that those forms are a little bit tired.  Those plots are a little bit saggy.  And that you suddenly turn around and find that in the story of your neighbor, or in the 
[02:06:00]  story of, you know, a guy down the block, is as dramatic as anything Hollywood puts out,  then I think you begin to realize there's a possibility in documentary.  What's your favorite?  Oh, sorry.  What's your favorite documentary that you didn't do?  You know, I've seen a lot of them.  I love that Fog of War.  Fog of War was amazing.  Fog of War was awesome.  Just about anything that Errol Morris does, I really, really love.  You know, I remember early on, I'd seen this film about the Yukon Gold Rush from the National  Film Board of Canada, and they had still photographs sort of set up in the scene, and I suddenly 
[02:06:30]  had this sort of aha moment of getting inside them.  I had originally wanted to be a feature filmmaker, but what I do, and this follows what we were  talking about earlier, is I want to treat an old photograph the way a feature filmmaker  would a wide shot.  That is possible of a close, a medium, an extreme close, a pan, a tilt, a reveal.  And I don't just want to look at it.  I want to listen to it.  You know, are those troops tramping?  Are the cannon firing?  Are the bayonets clashing?  That's what the amazing part is. 
[02:07:00]  If you would have a photograph of a battle sequence, the way the camera's moving on the  photograph, the sound effects behind it, you don't need a moving picture.  That's right.  Well, this is what we did.  There is not one single photograph of battle taken during the Civil War.  And yet, it moves because of a really complicated sound effects track, and that's what we also  do.  And all of that footage from the Second World War comes to us completely silently.  None of that stuff was taken with sound.  So it was incumbent upon us not just do the tramp, tramp, tramp feat of the Germans marching 
[02:07:30]  through Paris, but to add, you know, in some cases, hundreds of effects at any given moment,  or sometimes just flies buzzing and water lapping around the debris at a Pacific island after  a battle, when you see American bodies floating there.  Those two effects, the lapping water and the buzzing flies, does it all.  Or sometimes it puts you in it, and we got to know, what does a German 88 sound like fired  a half a mile away, and right next to you, and what does the shell ejecting, you know, 
[02:08:00]  sound like as it hits metal, or dirt, or snow, or mud?  And if you put those together, man, that still photograph, or that newsreel, that silent  newsreel, is suddenly looking like it's happening now.  It comes to life, absolutely.  Hey, we got Steve, who's in the Army.  Steve in Jersey, what's up, buddy?  Hey, yeah, I was a Marine.  In 2003, I went to Iraq.  You know, and I just want to thank you guys.  I love your show, and I'm really glad that someone's talking about this, because post-traumatic 
[02:08:30]  stress disorder, which I have, and a lot of guys I know have, is just something that  most people don't understand.  They don't understand, and we're so grateful for your service, and I think the thing is,  is that, you know, you go into war, and you're a human being, you want to live, and every  day you've got this stress that at any moment it might end, of course you're going to come  back and have something, and, you know, we've given a name to it.  We didn't have a name back in the Second World War, and there are exponentially more Second  World War veterans suffering than that, only because so many people were in uniform. 
[02:09:00]  It is going to happen when you go to war, because here's the compact, that we turn these  young teenagers and 20-somethings into professional killers.  Let's not kid ourselves.  That's what we're asking them to do.  And then when they're brought home, or the war's over, you say, okay, don't be a professional  killer again.  Stop.  Stop.  I mean, and the momentum of that terror does not stop just because some officer or some  piece of paper says it's over.  It goes on, and as we know from our World War II guys, it's still there, and the best  thing we can do as a country is not be ostriches, bury our heads in the sand and figure out what 
[02:09:30]  the next, you know, thing I need to buy in order to be cool is, but to spend a little time  with them and just honor it.  I mean, whether it's this gentleman who's just called in, or our grandpa, whoever it  is, and that's all.  It doesn't take any work.  It's not homework.  This is not obligation.  It just makes good human sense.  We got Janet from Pennsylvania.  Janet, what's up?  Hey.  I just want to say thank you to all the American women and men that are fighting for our freedom, 
[02:10:00]  and my dad was in World War II and involved in an incident that was kept top secret by  the United States government for 50 years and just started talking about it 10 years ago.  He was on an English transport ship that was sunk by the first guided German missile, and  more men died on that ship than the Arizona.  And they couldn't talk about it because they were anxious about the technology that the 
[02:10:30]  Germans had just unleashed on them.  Absolutely.  Absolutely.  And the men that died on that ship, their families were not told until 10 years ago that they died  on the sinking of that ship.  It was the HMT Roma.  Wow.  You know, we find this time and time again.  They didn't tell the actual casualties of Pearl Harbor until well after the war, and  specifically what ships were lost and the full extent of it.  Yeah, because who would want that information out there? 
[02:11:00]  They just didn't want the enemy to know how successful it had been, and they, you know,  it was about lying.  And we assume, because in this day and age, we get a lot of information very quickly, that  the day it happened, everybody knew all the details and what happened, and that's just  not the case.  Think about it today.  We're not allowed to see, you know, the government's forbidding, as they did in Vietnam in the  first go of filming, the caskets coming back, something that Americans saw all the time.  You'd be, you'd watch cargo ships unload these flag drake caskets and the big netting, you 
[02:11:30]  know.  And people would see on railroad stations this stuff, they'd show that stuff.  Roosevelt made the decision to go against the censors and show Americans what the cost  of war was at the Battle of Tarawa in late 43.  I mean, it was tough decision.  Today, there's nothing.  If you want to find out what's going on, you almost feel like a pornographer searching  the net, you know.  You have to find that stuff, and it's not necessarily coming from an American source or a European  source, but often from an Arab source that's gloating over the success of the kill, 
[02:12:00]  you know.  And, you know, we're in an age in which we're saturated with media, but we don't necessarily  know as much as we...  I think we absolutely should know what the cost is.  I think that's common sense.  And then we honor not only her father, but his service right now.  Whether you agree with the war or not, you've got to understand that Americans are in harm's  way at this moment.  Phones are lit.  One more call.  Charlie in Connecticut.  What do you got, Charlie?  Hey, man.  I just want to say I love the change-up to the show. 
[02:12:30]  I'm extremely patriotic.  I love your views and your innovative ways, Burns.  You're awesome.  And to Jimmy, man, you're awesome.  Thank you.  But I hate your face.  That's very hateable.  That's why I do radio.  LOL.  Jimmy, you're the man.  Thanks, buddy.  It says you're reading Ken's book right now?  No.  I actually had to read...  I'm reading it for sociology, and I'm getting through...  I'm getting through it.  I've never read a book in five years.  All right.  Thank you, Charlie. 
[02:13:00]  Well, of course...  You're inspiring people.  Of course, he's a fan of mine.  I've read a book in five years.  And Jimmy had a book out, so...  Yeah.  Big fan you are that you didn't read Jimmy's book.  Oh, man.  That's our music, Ken.  We've run out of time, but this was a very interesting hour.  I knew having Ken on would be great.  I've been a huge fan.  If you may allow me to gloat a little bit and kiss your ass a little bit.  I've just been a fan for years, and it's a pleasure to have you on the show.  This has been great.  Thank you.  Thank you so much.  So it's the war.  It's the book.  It's the CD.  It's the DVD. 
[02:13:30]  In stores now.  And you're doing a signing here in New York at the Time Warner Center in Columbus Circle.  The Borders.  This Wednesday at 7 p.m.  And then downtown McNally, Robinson Booksellers at 52 Prince Street this Friday at 7 o'clock.  Right?  And you're working on...  National Parks, Update on the Baseball Series, History of Prohibition, Vietnam, we're going  to start working on.  Oh, wow.  You're insane.  And Jeffrey Ross, we're going to have to have Jeffrey Ross back soon.  He just...  Yeah, Jeffrey.  Sorry, man.  You know, come on.  It's Ken Burns. 
[02:14:00]  For God's sake.  Hello?  Yeah, talking to your banana.  All right.  Ken Burns, thank you so much.  And you know what, Jeff?  The least you could have done while you were here is plug my New Year's Eve show at the  North Fork Theater.  What?  That's what Jeff did?  Oh, no.  Oh, whore.  What?  What?  I just wanted...  I was trying to help Jeff out.  I'm going to be there.  Jeffrey Ross will be at the Stress Factory December 5th in New Brunswick, New Jersey.  We've got to get out of here.  We'll see you guys tomorrow.  Thanks for listening.  O.P. and Anthony. 
[02:14:30]  O.P. and Anthony.  It's the O.P. and Anthony Show.  O.P. and Anthony. </pre>
