<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opened with a scathing critique of E-Rock's disastrous photos of a plane-helicopter crash, prompting a wave of mockery and leading E-Rock to delete his tweets.  This spurred a segment where staffer Danny replicated E-Rock's photographic failures, showcasing equally terrible pictures of NYC.  Listener calls piled on, with some hurling insults like "fat pig" at E-Rock, who made only brief, reluctant appearances in the studio, visibly annoyed. One caller recounted a blurry photo with Pat Morita.  The death of Eunice Kennedy Shriver was briefly mentioned, along with speculation about her appearance and family ties. The hosts debated the authenticity of a picture showing two men in opposing baseball jerseys kissing. A seemingly real but ultimately fake video of a massive slip-and-slide was presented, highlighting CGI advancements.

The show transitioned into a politically charged discussion surrounding Barack Obama's presidency, criticizing his healthcare proposals and alleged media bias (specifically MSNBC).  The hosts controversially discussed the potential for "socialist" to become a racial slur, similar to the N-word.  A significant portion focused on negative experiences with Continental Airlines, including anecdotes about seat upgrades, downgrades, passenger removals, and lengthy tarmac delays.  Listener calls recounted similar airline horror stories, ranging from drunk passengers causing delays to being bumped from flights, including one on the way to a mother's funeral.  The sex scandal at an Oprah Winfrey-funded South African girls' school was briefly discussed, alongside commentary on Bill and Hillary Clinton, including Bill's 63rd birthday. Profanity and irreverent humor were prevalent throughout this segment.


The next segment was dominated by listener calls detailing more appalling airline experiences. These included unruly passengers (one commandeering the PA system), a medically evacuated passenger from Iraq (after using profanity), and numerous tales of poor Continental Airlines service, such as overbooked flights and rude staff.  Many callers recounted absurd incidents, like pilot-hosted trivia contests for booze and luggage soaked in jet fuel. One caller described a 14-hour delay due to a passenger's heart attack.  A significant number of calls detailed sexual encounters with flight attendants, with the hosts mercilessly mocking one caller's poor storytelling abilities.  This "She was a stewardess" line became a recurring joke.  The segment also included a complaint about smaller Jimmy Dean sausages, a discussion of an upcoming comedy show, and a bizarre tale of a woman tricked into being a caregiver for a man pretending to be his disabled brother, involving diaper changing.  The segment concluded with a backstage exchange between Sam Roberts and E-Rock, fueled by E-Rock’s anger over an insulting phone call.


The show then moved to a discussion of a man using PTSD as an excuse for diaper-related deception, leading into a humorous (and crude) discussion of diaper fetishes and adult baby enthusiasts.  The hosts expressed frustration at their inability to get a photo with Juliette Lewis, who was present for an interview.  A caller, Jeff, shared a shocking (and possibly fabricated) story about his 42-year-old brother-in-law who publicly wears diapers, even involving his mother.  This fueled a discussion about attention-seeking behavior. The show included graphic descriptions and images of self-harm found online, followed by a humorous segment featuring increasingly absurd pornography and online videos. Clips from Sam Roberts' interview with Juliette Lewis were interspersed with the hosts' commentary, covering her music, acting (including an uncomfortable scene in "Cape Fear"), and her personality.  The segment concluded with banter, including a discussion of a Leather Tuscadero song and the breakup of Brooks & Dunn.


The final segment focused heavily on Brooks & Dunn songs, interwoven with vulgar jokes and listener calls.  Snippets of Brooks & Dunn music were played, while the hosts debated their merits.  Listener calls included a man grappling with the deaths of his dog and wife, a repeated "she was a stewardess" story, and other sexually explicit anecdotes.  The hosts jokingly called a listener "Kenny Cow Shit" and invented a fictitious, offensive Brooks & Dunn song.  Jimmy’s upcoming comedy show was promoted, highlighting the venue’s past as a porn theater.  The repeated mocking of the stewardess story concluded the segment, with a mention of a CokeLogic animation and a discussion of the pros and cons of small-town versus big-city gigs for the comedian.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  But enough of this palaver! Let's get the show on the road!  Morning.  Morning.  Morning.  Morning to ye.  Morning to ye.  Ah, only Tuesday?  We're getting there.  What happened?  Summer vacation right around the corner.  I know. 
[00:00:30]  It never changes from when you were in school.  No.  And like summer vacation was coming up.  That last week.  That's how we feel right now.  It's like, I want to go on vacation.  We just want to get to Friday.  Yeah.  Recharge the batteries.  Come back and kick some more ass.  Executica-tackily.  So last we left you, E-Rock was tweeting his ass off about the plane helicopter crash over the Hudson.  He was an eyewitness reporter. 
[00:01:00]  He was an eye reporter.  You could call him that.  I call him a buffoon.  CNN has eye reporters now.  Eye reporters?  Is that what it is?  You can sign up to be an eye reporter.  And then if you see news happening, you take pictures.  And then you send it to CNN.  And then sometimes they use your stuff.  He would be dropped so quickly as an eye reporter.  Oh, it's a mouth reporter.  I guess we got an update.  We were busting his ball so bad yesterday because he was tweeting all sorts of pictures of supposed dead bodies and parts of the plane. 
[00:01:30]  Like you'd read one of his Twitters and it's like, wow, another body coming out of the water.  And you're like, what the?  All right, let me check this out.  You click on it and there's a boat a mile away from his camera in the water.  That's all you see.  It looked like it did.  It looked like a postcard.  Yeah.  Well, we busted his ball so bad that E-Rock took down all his tweets about the airplane helicopter crash over the Hudson River. 
[00:02:00]  He deleted all of his tweets about that because he got ragged so badly.  I think he really believed that he was getting some good pictures until we had to point them out that they were horrible.  But why get rid of them?  I mean, that brings more attention to it.  And then Danny's responses, his little pictures.  Danny was playing E-Rock yesterday.  Yeah.  I don't know if you're a follower of mine.  I've started to tweet. 
[00:02:30]  Big duties, huh?  Yes.  Don't you know it?  It's with an I-E-S, duties.  Right.  So I just, you know, I had a big day yesterday.  And so I decided to share my big day with everybody.  And so, you know, I tweeted.  What were some of the tweets that you did in honor of, like, how E-Rock tweets?  Well, it all started when I was leaving the building.  I saw this.  This is called, Holy Crap, Look at This Douchebag.  I couldn't believe it.  Holy Crap, Look at This Douchebag.  It's a picture from the 36th floor looking down onto the streets of New York City. 
[00:03:00]  You can barely even make out humans.  Here's the mega celebrity sighting here at Sirius XM.  Yeah.  It's just a hallway.  Which person is supposed to be the celebrity?  This guy right there.  Wait.  What's wrong with you?  Way, way down at the end of the hallway.  You better get that LASIK checked out.  This is total friggin' E-Rock-ish.  Then I was pissed off about what Bloomberg did to Times Square.  So I took a pic so I could share it with everybody. 
[00:03:30]  Sure.  Let's see that.  Let me just poke that one up there.  Picture of a Times Square.  Wow.  Yeah.  It's an amazing picture of Times Square, Danny.  It's through a gap between two buildings that you can barely even see through.  And on the way home, I was passing through Citi Field and noticed a big to-do, so I snapped  a pic of all the action that was going down on there.  Oh, wow.  It's an outdoor shot of Citi Field as you're driving by 60, 70 miles an hour.  Most of that picture is fucking the car windshield and the thing that divides the windshield and  the passenger side window. 
[00:04:00]  And the door.  It's covering up the entire...  Part of the roof.  That's a terrible photo.  Of course it is.  And then I noticed that there was a lot of air traffic yesterday, and I thought I saw  something.  It looked like a problem with landing gear on a plane.  Uh-oh.  So it worried me.  Was this in the paper at all today?  Bunch of trees in the sky.  I can't even see the plane.  Oh, it's there.  Let me blow it up for you.  Wait, hang on.  Let me just blow it up.  Please pull up the picture.  Oh, it's there.  And you can totally see that there's something going on.  Something was going... 
[00:04:30]  Iraq, comment?  Not my photo.  Not my photo.  Look, look.  See, there's the plane.  Where's the plane?  I didn't know you.  It's right there.  Jesus.  Todd.  All right.  Whatever.  What happened, Iraq?  Iraq, what happened yesterday?  You took that very seriously?  Were you bummed that we weren't impressed with your...  Why'd you take down your...  With your pictures from the plane?  Well, it was the...  All of your posts.  It was the constant flood of direct messaging that I was getting, so I was like, all right,  fuck this.  So you took down every single one of your big story...  Why?  That was a big day for you. 
[00:05:00]  Yeah.  You were the on-the-scene reporter.  Why'd you take them all down?  Because they were shit photos.  You couldn't tell at the time when you were taking them on the camera.  He's fessing up that they were shit photos.  And you are...  You break really easily.  Yeah.  Really?  You really do.  Yesterday, he's like, come on, you can see this here.  And today, it's like, they were shit photos.  There's too much direct messaging.  And then it's like, all right, look, they were just bad photos.  But I love how he said that he couldn't tell when he was taking them at the time, but you  couldn't tell when you had them up either. 
[00:05:30]  Yeah.  You had a look at them.  Because it took you, what, over 24 hours to finally get rid of all of them.  So?  Made good content for the show, didn't it?  Oh, absolutely.  There you go.  That's it.  But we're bummed that you took it all down.  I'm bummed that you took down my favorite, which was the debris in the water, which looked  like some styrofoam cups.  It looked like a plastic bag on a pool cover.  Yeah.  Yeah.  There was no scale to the picture, so we couldn't really tell what it was.  No, we couldn't tell what it was.  It could have been an iceberg or, yeah, a piece of styrofoam, a styrofoam packing peanut 
[00:06:00]  or an iceberg.  You guys want to see my UFO picture?  Oh, yeah.  Oh, please.  Big duties.  This was a big one.  On Twitter.  Check that out.  Wow.  It says the...  Fucking nuts, right?  You can kind of see.  Well, through the...  I guess it's through the tree somehow.  There's a UFO in there somewhere.  It must have just darted off.  It's like, where's Waldo?  You got to kind of figure out where Waldo is in Danny's pictures.  Just spectacular.  I mean, Danny doing the pictures like E-Rock does the pictures.  You should have taken him down.  We had a whole nother day planned.  I know. 
[00:06:30]  What are you doing?  She left him up.  Yeah.  Are you bummed, E-Rock, that we weren't impressed?  No.  No.  I'll tell you what it was.  When I got home after they were posted and stuff, I looked at them and I went, oh my  God.  They looked a lot worse than on the little screen of the phone.  Yeah.  So I was just like, they're already up there.  If I took them down, I figured it'd draw more attention.  So I figured I'd leave them up.  It served its purpose.  Now they're gone.  Well, taking them down did bring more attention to it. 
[00:07:00]  Yeah.  You should have just left it alone.  Yeah.  Absolutely.  Yeah.  Because we wouldn't have talked about it again today.  Well, perhaps.  I don't know.  Let's go to Tony in Brooklyn.  Tony, what's going on?  Oh, E-Rock.  How fast five years have gone by.  Buddy, do you see the career dissipation light blinking in the corner of your eye, buddy?  You've become the I Smell Duty guy on the show.  You used to sit at the right hand of OB and now you're just Pat Duffy 2. 
[00:07:30]  That's all you are, buddy.  Oh, Pat Duffy 2.  Watch it out.  All right.  Oh, wow.  How quickly today.  Wow.  It's not even, you know, barely started the show and you're in the barrel.  Yeah.  Let's go to Joe in Minnesota.  Hey, good morning, boy.  Yeah.  All right.  Joe, what's up?  Yeah.  In E-Rock's defense, I bragged to all my buddies when I went back to L.A. that I was going to  come back with a picture of somebody mean and somebody famous.  Got to the airport on the way back and there's Pat Morita.  So I sit down next to him. 
[00:08:00]  I'm like, how are you doing, Pat?  He buys me a drink.  I handed the bartender my camera.  I'm like, Pat, I just got to get a picture of somebody famous.  So he took the picture.  I get back to the cities here.  I get everything developed.  I get to work and I'm showing everybody.  I'm like, check it out.  Check it out.  Here it comes.  Pat Morita and me.  No, it's an outline of two people.  Me and Pat Morita.  So forever I got teased about, oh, look, here, it's me and the Queen of England.  Oh, but you can't see us.  Oh, what?  Was the window behind you or something bright?  No.  Well, it was just, it was a dark bar and we didn't use the flash. 
[00:08:30]  Oh, God.  What year was this?  Now Pat Morita's dead.  What year was this?  This was 2002.  2002 and probably two.  Oh, okay.  So you have a, I hope you have a digital now.  Dude, there's nothing worse.  There's nothing worse than a celebrity picture that doesn't come out.  I had a big one not come out.  My fucking Charlton Heston.  Yeah.  It came out blurry.  You could see it at a 10 though, but it was really blurry.  Chuck Heston.  And this was before digital cameras because now you could check and maybe you got a second  shot at it. 
[00:09:00]  But the old days you took the picture and you had to go get the film developed hoping for  the best and you get them back and like, oh, fuck.  Yeah, you had no clue.  No, no clue.  One more for safety.  Yeah, you didn't do the safety shot.  Safety shot's the stupidest thing ever because you're doing the exact same shot just twice.  Yeah, same picture twice.  So how are you going to get two different pictures out of that scenario?  On digital, it's fine.  You just delete it.  But on the old cameras, you had to do that because if it was an important picture and 
[00:09:30]  one didn't come out.  Right.  Oh, well.  All right, Iraq.  This should bother you, Iraq.  Iraq, Eunice Kennedy Shriver, dead.  Dead?  She's 88 years old.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  She was hospitalized and she died.  She just died.  Which one was she?  She was retarded, right?  No.  No, she started the Special Olympics.  She was, yeah, she started the Special Olympics is right.  She lived in Hyannis.  Was she related to the retarded Kennedy?  I'm imagining, I'm going to guess she was, yeah, I'm sure.  Yeah.  I have no idea. 
[00:10:00]  She was just one of the sisters, right?  Oh, my God.  She had some relations because she...  She was Ted's sister, no?  Eunice Kennedy.  Who are we at?  Yeah, she is.  With JFK.  She was old even then.  My God.  88 is fucking old.  Yeah.  Eunice.  Eunice.  What a cute name.  Oh, God, Danny popped a picture up on there.  That is a walking corpse.  88 years.  She was very...  Was she really a shyness mother?  Sister of JFK. 
[00:10:30]  Sister of JFK.  There you go.  Sister of JFK.  Yeah.  She looks like him, too.  Wow.  JFK really didn't translate into a woman face.  I know.  We're looking at old footage of her.  She looks exactly like him, but with a girl's hair.  Yeah.  And they're showing the Special Olympics, so that was nice.  Oh, cool.  We'll be seeing Special Olympics footage all day.  Here it is.  She left her mark, which is very, very good.  That's all you want from your life.  Leave your mark.  Oh, boy.  All right.  She's the one that, yeah, gave us so much material over the years. 
[00:11:00]  In honor of Eunice.  Here she is with Ray.  Play Strive or Dying.  We'll play the Special Olympics song today.  Wow.  She was old when she met Reagan.  Yeah.  Dude, she had a John F. Kennedy face she had.  I mean, you could not deny she was a sister.  She looked exactly like JFK.  She was old for 40 years.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Then she gets together a sporting event with people that have less brains than her brother did.  Jesus. 
[00:11:30]  Oops.  And that was the last Eunice to die, too, by the way.  Was it?  Yeah, that was it.  There was no one else named Eunice.  Nope.  That was it.  Little known fact.  She was the last Eunice living on this earth.  Eunice.  John and George is on the phone.  He just wants to call Iraq a fat pig.  I mean, that's just...  Let's get Iraq in here.  Why not?  Get Iraq.  Does he know?  Let's get him in here.  I think that this call should be heard. 
[00:12:00]  Just tell him we have one more phone call.  So was that Schwarzenegger's wife's mother?  Mm-hmm.  I'm thinking, yeah.  88 years old and it's her mother?  Yeah.  I mean, let's just say she's fucking 50.  Yeah, I guess so.  38.  She's probably pushing...  Oh, my God.  Maria Shravitz probably 50, right?  Yeah, right.  She's probably older than 50.  She's been around forever.  How old is Schwarzenegger?  She's funny, too, man.  I saw her eulogize fucking...  She was eulogizing Tim Russert.  Yeah.  She's funny, man. 
[00:12:30]  Yeah, she's really funny.  Really?  Uh-huh.  Some laughs.  I mean, really funny.  Like, very comfortable speaker.  As we get E-Rock, why are we looking at a picture of two burly gay guys making out, one with  a Yankee jersey and hat on and the other guy with a Red Sox hat in jersey on?  Yeah, this one's been making the rounds.  Really?  Yeah.  What's that about?  Why is it up there?  It's hot.  I don't know.  People are assuming it's Photoshopped, but because where would that happen and why?  That looks like...  Where is that? 
[00:13:00]  Lansdowne Street or...  E-Rock doesn't look happy.  Go ahead.  No, it's just...  Oh, what's the matter?  Eric does not want to come in here.  Why?  John at Georgia, we brought E-Rock all the way back from way down the hall.  He's in the office, really busy, working on something very important for the show that  you guys will never know that he was responsible for.  Yes.  So, John, what do you got?  Hey, E-Rock?  Yeah, go ahead.  I just wanted to let you know you're a fat pig.  Thanks, asshole.  Play the little Nicky stuff when you get a chance. 
[00:13:30]  Holy shit, he's so pissed off.  Oh, my God, is he pissed.  Look at him now trudging down the hall.  Now he's got to do the walk of shame that we can watch for 20 minutes.  Ah, and now Sam's just abusing him down at the end of the hallway.  Now he goes and gets abused by Sam.  Oh, if he doesn't come in shooting one day.  It's not even fair. 
[00:14:00]  He was hard at work really trying to do something for the show.  Yeah.  Something we'll probably play later.  It'll go over real well.  You'll never know E-Rock gave it to us.  Never know it was him.  We interrupted him.  He had to come all the way down to be called a fat pig by a listener.  And now he walks back to the office.  Ah.  All right.  Poor guy.  So where were we?  Eunice?  Eunice.  Kennedy Schreiber's officially dead.  Dead. 
[00:14:30]  Sick for the last few days.  J.F.K.'s sister.  Sister who started the Special Olympics.  Boy, she had a fucking rough go with brothers.  You know, you forget like when you watch the RFK getting killed by Sirhan Sirhan or J.F.K.  You forget that that was somebody's brother.  How about she lost three?  Everything's on film like that too.  It's like, oh, let's go to the family movies.  Here's John getting his head blown apart.  But the Zapruder film is just such a part of America.  It's like such American history.  It's like, and then for her, it's like, oh, it's the guy I used to fucking spend Christmases with. 
[00:15:00]  And murdered.  Do you think she's watched it?  You wonder if Onassis did?  Because it didn't surface until five years after the death.  Yeah.  They had to have watched it.  You think?  I'm sure they've seen it.  Absolutely.  That's got to be brutal.  Not over and over again like we've seen it, but.  That's got to be brutal.  Of course it is.  You had to see it by accident.  Unless they could walk away every time because it does have a lead up.  But there had to be one time they were flipping through and they saw J.F.K. the movie or something.  Oh, right at that moment when you click the channel, it's just like, oh, Jesus Christ.  Not again.  Like they saw Kosta saying back and to the left. 
[00:15:30]  And they thought, oh, this must be a dance movie.  Oh, no, it's not.  My bad.  Whoops.  Yeah.  Well, she lost three brothers, though.  Who was the other one?  The one in the war.  Oh, okay, okay.  Who was the one in the war?  His name was Jack officially or something?  Was it?  Because that's like what they called John.  Yeah.  Well, he took on the nickname of his older brother.  I don't know.  And fucking Ted.  Somebody help me out here.  Ted's old pudding head.  Yeah, but at least he still outlived her.  Pumping blood through his body.  Is he still working?  His body. 
[00:16:00]  Yeah.  Who knows?  But he still has his gig, right?  His brain got fucked.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  They fixed his brain?  No.  No.  He's still so fucked up, but they just can't throw him out.  I'm sure he's got some aides that do pretty much everything for him.  Who was the first Kennedy brother to die?  What was his name?  I want to say Jack.  Joseph Jr.?  Oh, Joseph.  Oh, right.  But didn't they call him Jack or something?  I don't know.  I think there was some kind of...  Joe Jr. 
[00:16:30]  And then there's John.  Some kind of connection with the name Jack.  And then, what was that?  Bobby Kennedy's son died skiing?  Mm-hmm.  Is that the one that hit the tree?  When?  Back then?  No.  How long ago?  Oh, that was AF days.  Yeah, yeah.  I know from radio gigs.  Right.  So that was like the mid-90s.  Let's say hi to Jimmy James in New Hampshire.  Jimmy James.  Oh, you could call me Jimmy.  You could call me James.  How's it going? 
[00:17:00]  We're kind of just waking up.  That picture of the two gay guys kissing, if it's the one I'm thinking of, one of those  gentlemen bears an uncanny resemblance to the Hillman from WAAF.  Is the Hillman still working at AF?  Oh, my God.  Where else is he going to go?  Holy shit.  The Hillman on the right, but he's wearing the Yankee uniform.  Right.  Why would he do that?  Is that like him and LB or something?  The Hillman and LB making out is a little bit.  LB's all right.  He's knuckles in his hair. 
[00:17:30]  I don't mind the LB.  It's the HM, I mind.  Do you think that's shopped?  Is that shopped?  Why would it be shopped?  I don't know.  That shit's happening all over the place.  The hat line looks a little flat on the Yankee hat against the guy's face.  You're saying the lips look a little weird, too.  The lips look weird, and the jerseys together don't really, like it looks like he's in the  other guy's fat gut instead of leaning against it. 
[00:18:00]  I say that shopped.  I think you're right, Adam.  Why wouldn't the other guy there in the background, anybody be looking at these two?  And if you're going to kiss another man, wouldn't you hold him, wouldn't you be holding him?  Yeah, yeah.  You don't just kiss another man like that.  You grab his shoulders.  You got to grab on.  Or you grab his waist.  Something.  Give him a good kissing, or the back of his head.  You hold his forearms, and they're too thick for your wrist to go around. 
[00:18:30]  A thick forearmed man.  Yes.  Oh, boy.  Yeah, I think that's shopped.  Yeah.  Fudge you out, boys.  Thank you.  I'm seeing it.  All right.  There's a shadow under the guy's brim, and that's about the only shadow you see on the  other guy's face, and then everything else is too flat.  Well, it seems like it would be an easy shot to do if someone was going for some kind of  shock value.  Yeah.  Get two gay guys to wear two different jerseys and just go at it. 
[00:19:00]  They didn't take the picture.  But they didn't.  That's shopped.  All right.  Why don't we do it for real?  Let's get a couple guys in here.  All right.  Steve and who?  Let's say hi to Stryker.  Stryker.  Stryker.  Stryker.  Good evening.  Hello.  Pat from Menachie writes, that picture was homo shopped.  That's an ass.  What do you got, Stryker?  Yeah.  In defense of E-Rock, I noticed Opie did the douchey, that could have been me on that helicopter 
[00:19:30]  because I was there two years ago with my check.  Stryker.  How long have you been listening to this show?  Stryker.  For real.  Come on, Stryker.  Too goddamn long.  You don't understand a little sarcasm?  Well, yes, I do.  But how many times does Opie call out Joe Citizen for making the exact same comment?  Exactly.  No, I did it as a complete joke because every time there is a tragedy, people try to like  relate to it in some way.  Joe Citizen calling Opie out for the same thing. 
[00:20:00]  It's the exact same thing.  I'll tell you the God's honest truth, and this is still not close enough to the tragedy,  but I have a niece up from Florida, and I was thinking, you know, a few years ago, I  took that nice little helicopter tour, and I was just thinking, maybe I'll take her up  in a helicopter and do that tour.  Yikes.  But never booked in, none of that, but it was in my mind for the first time in a few  years.  Wow.  I'm never going on one of those fucking helicopter tours again.  Well, you're probably safe for a while now.  Well, the NYPD wants to take me up in a chopper. 
[00:20:30]  I'm sure that one's fine.  And they say that's way better than any tour that Liberty could do for you anyway.  Oh, forget it.  I want to hang off the buildings.  Thank you, Stryker.  No, boy.  All right, brother.  Hang off the pontoon.  Is that what it's called?  Or the pylon.  Oh, I don't know.  Hold on.  That'd be cool.  Just hold on to it.  What does Colin Quinn say about the, what was his big line about 9-11?  Probably.  What was it?  Come on.  It was a classic line about.  He said people were trying to battle. 
[00:21:00]  He goes, people were like, you know, something told me not to go down there that day.  Yeah, the news.  The news told you.  And then, what did he say?  You know, I was going to take, I just think, you know, if I would have taken that number  two train, oh, do you take the two train often?  No, I've never taken the two train in my life.  There's something about how I live up in Utica, where I fucking operate the go-karts where kids  throw five alive cans at me.  Something very funny about it, which I don't remember.  Something told me not to go down there.  The news.  The news. 
[00:21:30]  That's great.  A lot of people do that, though.  You're kind of trying to attach yourself to these tragedies.  Did they get all the bodies out of the Hudson?  No, one left.  One left?  One left in.  They couldn't get him.  They couldn't extricate him from the wreckage.  What wreckage is down there still?  The plane.  They got the chopper out, though, right?  Yeah.  You know what's weird?  It's business as usual in this city.  Yeah.  You can't even tell that there was a massive tragedy over the Hudson River.  No.  A mere, what, two days ago, three days ago? 
[00:22:00]  It just moves on.  They just hose down the area even though it's water.  That's it.  And it's back to business.  There's a dead guy down there.  There's a dead guy right at the bottom of the Hudson right now in a plane.  Why do we have to, like, I don't know.  Maybe the family wants him.  Yeah.  Well, the greatest one ever was the JFK Jr.  Oh, you forgot about that one, too.  Yeah, yeah, JFK Jr., right.  JFK Jr. there, Jimmy.  Well, that Kennedy family, holy shit. 
[00:22:30]  And we had to find him just so we could throw him back in the water.  Yeah, yeah.  That's just.  Burial at sea.  They found him so they could put him back in the water.  That is just so weird.  And they used Navy ships and everything that nobody would have gotten.  Right.  Uh, let me say hi to Steve on Long Island.  Steve.  Yes.  Hey.  Good evening.  Good evening, Steve.  Listen, I want to talk to E-Rock in his native tongue.  Give him a message for me.  Moo. 
[00:23:00]  Oh, that's implying he's a cow.  I don't think.  I think we should tell E-Rock yourself.  Yeah, maybe he should have told him himself.  He's about to kill somebody.  Do we have that?  I think E-Rock should hear that himself.  I don't think we should be translating this.  I hung up on the guy already.  We have it taped, I'm sure, right, Travis?  Travis has it.  Someone else will call, too.  I want to go on record and say I don't want to be part of this.  I don't either.  I just, if somebody wants to tell Eric something, it's not my business to translate.  What are you saying?  Yeah, why should we, you know.  What are you saying?  Nothing.  I think E-Rock should be, like, look, if someone told me something, I'd want to. 
[00:23:30]  Are you requesting that E-Rock come back to the studio?  It's a long walk, and I'm sure he's busy with something.  Yeah, I think so, though.  Well, maybe, but, you know, he really should come down and address the callers and stuff,  I think.  I think if somebody calls, you know, and wants to talk to E-Rock, that's fine.  I think we're only obligated to, because I would want people, I don't want my messages  given to the director.  Yeah, I would want to talk, you know, to the listener.  Well, I'm not going to say E-Rock come here.  Jimmy, if you want. 
[00:24:00]  Oh, of course I will.  All right.  Say it officially.  Wait until there's no calls for him.  Hi, Pierce.  I see Sam wandering around down at the end of the hall.  Maybe he's trying to get E-Rock to make the long walk.  Well, there's no one on the phone for him.  What is that computer illiterate dolt doing out there?  The way he looks at a computer with his glasses on, he's got, like, he cranes his neck,  and he hits one key and then looks at the screen again, hits another key, cranes his neck, 
[00:24:30]  looks at the screen with his glasses on.  It's like Grandpa.  It's like watching Grandpa.  Hi, Kenny.  What do you think he's thinking as he looks at that computer screen?  I'm thinking?  Stop.  Yeah.  Whatever it is, he goes for eight seconds and then he forgets it and starts over.  Hi, Kenny.  Kenny, what is it?  Good morning.  You're not too, like, sharp on those computers.  It takes you a long time to type out anything.  Yeah, yeah.  I'm a whiz with two fingers, believe me. 
[00:25:00]  Yeah?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  But, and you also, you like, you crane your neck and look at what you just typed through  your reading glasses, and then you look back down at the keyboard and tick one key and then  you crane your neck and look real close again.  I pride myself on being precise.  Is that it?  Yeah, I was given a task.  You're precisely an ass.  Are you impressed at what the computer could do?  Yeah.  Yeah. 
[00:25:30]  Yeah.  I'm sorry I interrupted your work, sir.  No, it's okay.  You got to show it, though.  Yeah.  All right.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Do you have, like, a lot of calluses on just your index finger?  And his trigger.  His middle and trigger.  Those are two good fingers.  Two fingers.  I'm a whiz.  All right.  So, you know, because there's big Jim Norton show info coming.  Yes.  Really?  Oh, boy.  Oh, that's a little teaser.  Oh, okay.  Now I understand why he's taking his time typing it, because if there's one typo, there'll 
[00:26:00]  be hell to pay, sir.  Let's say hi to Robin in Kansas.  Robin.  Hey, Opie, you guys got to lay off EROC.  You don't want to have to deal with mad cow disease in the studio, do you?  Oh, boy.  Oh, you know what?  Why are you telling us this?  Oh, boy.  Oh, I'm sorry.  Did you want to tell us this, or did you want to tell EROC this?  What are you getting at, Jimmy?  What does she want?  Miss?  He's not in.  All right.  Let's go to Justin in New York. 
[00:26:30]  Justin.  Good evening.  Hi, Justin.  Hi.  I wanted to ask EROC.  He said he's working on something very important.  Hold on.  He's not here.  Just get him.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Don't go anywhere.  He's really busy doing something.  I know he is.  Yeah, go get EROC.  All right, Danny's walking, well, sprinting down the long hallway to go get EROC.  I just don't want to translate for Eric.  What Eric's doing is important.  Yeah, yeah.  I mean, this is a caller for EROC.  Just play along at home, by the way, and feel how long it takes for EROC to make it all 
[00:27:00]  the way down the studio.  It's exercise.  It's okay.  You all right there?  Justin.  What's up?  Yeah, okay.  Hold on.  It's very distracting to hear that.  Wait until I see Sam by the doorway.  This is how long it takes for EROC to come all the way down the hall.  I saw Sam at the door, and then I saw Danny fly out the door.  And Sam is sprinting down the hall.  As if he was pushed away by EROC, perhaps. 
[00:27:30]  And Sam is now running.  Laughing.  He's laughing his ass off now.  What's up, Sam?  What just happened?  He's so pissed.  Danny just said, come on, man.  What do you want me to do?  They're asking for you.  And then EROC said, like, you know, fuck off or something.  And Danny said, don't try to act like you're busy all of a sudden.  And EROC took a can of Pepsi that it obviously, it was open, but it had just been open.  So it was like a full can, except it leaks and just chucked it as hard as it could out of the office at Danny. 
[00:28:00]  And it's just, no, it's pouring out into the hall.  Should we get the really long cord so we could get an interview with EROC?  He is so pissed.  Why is he angry?  For what?  All right, here comes Danny.  You think he'd appreciate the fact that we want him to be talked to these people?  Is Danny have soda on him, or did he miss?  He probably has soda on the leg area. 
[00:28:30]  Not happy, EROC.  Danny, what happened?  EROC not happy?  I can't imagine.  All right, Eric doesn't want to come in.  I don't know.  What happened, though?  Why is he so uptight today?  I don't know.  He's taking that whole Twitter thing from yesterday seriously.  He takes everything too seriously.  Because I think he really thought he was getting some exclusive stuff for everybody.  Yeah, yeah.  He had visions of being the Twitter king.  Like, he's on the front page of Twitter.com.  Or maybe CNN would have had him on there.  CNN's dragging him in with his face.  His Twitter pictures.  Like, somebody that really kept us up to date was Eric Nagel. 
[00:29:00]  And we're here now, live with Eric Nagel.  And then there he is, just sitting and chatting.  Well, I was there, and I was taking pictures.  And I know Twitter reaches so many people.  Boo.  His pictures were like, my cousin Vinny's girlfriend, if they didn't win the case.  It was just like, what is this picture of fucking dog shit?  Yeah, no, that's great.  Positive traction on the, there was positive traction on the plane.  That's why it hit the helicopter. 
[00:29:30]  I think you can tell by the, well, the thing is that E-Rock wanted to be interviewed by,  I forget what I was going to say.  Larry King or CNN.  Oh, he wanted to be anything.  Yeah.  But what's happening, which is, hello?  Moo.  That was the last thing on his list of what he wanted to happen.  You think he had visions of, like, Larry King or someone going, do you mind sitting through the break?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  We really want to, like, really get into more of your pictures, but we really got to take a commercial break.  Ladies and gentlemen, Twitter hero Eric Nagel, who twittered the details of the helicopter plane crash like nobody else. 
[00:30:00]  Well, Larry, I was by the park, by Frank Sinatra Park, and I was taking pictures.  Let's get some of those pictures here up on the board.  Wow, what is this one?  It's fascinating.  That is debris in the water, Larry.  Really? 
[00:30:30]  It looks like my last bowel movement.  You don't think Larry would have been impressed?  Not at all.  Sam.  Can you tell the Iraq that we have one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine people on hold right now?  The boss is calling for him.  He's got to come in.  And I told him, these are the subscribers.  These are the people who pay his checks.  He should be valuing them a little more.  It's almost like a politician.  You have to answer to the public.  Tell him there's no saying no to this.  Jimmy, give Sam a message to give to Iraq. 
[00:31:00]  Sam's the messenger right now.  The bottom line is this.  We need him on the show right now.  We know he's working hard.  Yes, in here.  Yeah, but the people want to talk to him and there's no way of getting around it.  There's nothing.  Couldn't be helped.  By the way, this is the photo that Eric wanted to tweet.  Like he was hoping to get the Jack Ruby shooting.  Oh, right.  Yeah, yeah.  That's how important in history he wanted.  We're hoping to get a photo of him like that, clenching up in a sweater.  Clenching a ham.  Yeah, he thought he was getting the flag being raised on Iwo Jima.  All those famous shots. 
[00:31:30]  And what did he get?  A picture of shit.  Yeah, he wanted to be part of that exclusive club that got the famous shot.  I don't see him making his way out of the office.  I also don't see Sam leaving the office.  That's not good.  Sam is trying to convey.  Sam's probably being strangled to death finally for being a wise ass.  His pencil neck is just being snapped by E-Rock's meaty hands.  No one would be surprised. 
[00:32:00]  I'm not seeing anyone come out of here.  Now, we're really demanding that he come out.  There's the picture of the victory in Times Square with the sailor kissing the nurse.  Didn't Eric take that?  That's a Twitter picture that Eric took.  You know what we should do is a split screen.  Like, we should have the famous shot.  And then if E-Rock was there, what it would look like.  I think he's taking it very seriously. 
[00:32:30]  What happened?  Yeah, I'm waiting.  Here comes now Sam.  Sam is trying to give him a pep talk.  He's waving him out.  Troy Kwan is down the end of the hallway.  He just gave a thumbs up or something.  But Sam is really trying to get him out of there.  He's clapping.  I don't know.  He's keeping a safe distance, I notice.  He's trying to get...  It's almost as if there's a big gorilla in there eating.  And he's trying to get him out.  Lord him with a banana. 
[00:33:00]  Some of the phone calls I know we're not going to get to.  Nick in Nebraska.  E-Rock is going to blow his brains out one day.  And cholesterol will be everywhere.  Oh, shit.  People now...  It would be nice to Eric when you talk to him.  Don't call up and make obnoxious remarks.  Yes, yes.  He's in a very bad mood.  Wow, he is just not coming.  He'll come.  Tell him the guys demand he come down here.  This is not a bit.  Get him down here now.  Yeah.  It's not a bit.  Of course it's not. 
[00:33:30]  Poor guy.  You know what?  It's cracking because he fell yesterday into a hole.  It's an elephant.  It's a picture of an elephant that fell in a hole.  Here comes E-Rock.  Jesus Christ.  All right.  Here he comes.  All right.  He's making his way down the hallway.  I thought it was Paul Abdul.  No, this is his baby elephant walk.  Yeah, I know.  I know.  Oh, my God.  He's not going to like this.  He's not going to be fucking happy with that music.  He will not be happy with this.  Don't smile. 
[00:34:00]  Oh.  Hi, E-Rock.  Hi, E-Rock.  Hi, Eric.  What were you working on down the hall?  It doesn't matter.  Let's get this going.  Thank you, Sam.  It doesn't matter.  Let's get this going.  Oh, boy.  This just isn't good.  Jimmy, why do we have E-Rock back in the studio?  Well, there were some callers, I think, that wanted to talk. 
[00:34:30]  I think he said nine.  Oh, was it nine?  Oh, are there nine?  Which one do you want me to start with, E-Rock?  I don't know.  I can't see the screen, so.  Well, pick a number.  How about six?  Six.  All right.  Let's go to six and say hi to Chris in Pennsylvania.  Chris.  Hey, next time we got to call E-Rock from down the hall, just yell,  She-Woo, she-Woo, she-Woo, she-Woo.  Out.  All right.  That's just mean, dude.  Yeah.  That's just mean.  You want another one?  Four.  All right. 
[00:35:00]  Four.  Jeff in Staten Island.  Jeff.  Hello.  E-Rock.  Yeah.  Okay, that one wasn't bad.  Pick another number.  One.  All right.  Sean in North Carolina.  Sean?  Uh, actually, the photos were pretty good that he posted,  but the ones that he had to throw away where he got his fifth in the photo were horrendous.  E-Rock does not have a hoof. 
[00:35:30]  Fucking terrible, dude.  That's an awful, awful thing to say.  Uh, go ahead.  Two.  Mm-hmm.  Uh, Steve on Long Island.  Steve?  I'm back.  Hey, E-Rock, when it's 2012 and the world's about to end, will your pits flood the earth?  Moo.  Want to pick another number?  Uh, five.  Five.  All right.  Let's say hi to Ralph in Rhode Island. 
[00:36:00]  Ralph?  Hey, what's going on, brother?  Hey, Ralph.  Hey, yeah.  E-Rock, I just want to know if they properly searched you down in security today.  You know, I heard you got a little rolls there.  We want to make sure you're not packing.  Moo!  All right.  Another number?  Uh, seven.  Seven?  Okay.  Paul in Jersey.  Paul?  Hey, Eric.  I was wondering if when you go home, do you tell your problems to your pet spider, Charlotte? 
[00:36:30]  Oh, see, that's Charlotte's web joke, I guess.  Another number?  Eight.  All right.  Eight.  Uh, Ben in North Carolina.  Ben.  Hey, E-Rock.  I was wondering, I think the delay in you getting to the studio was the shoot got stuck when you come out of it.  Moo.  You still have, uh... 
[00:37:00]  Nine.  I still have nine.  You still have nine.  Scott in Tampa, Scott.  Hey, boys, don't be so hard on Eric.  I know why it took him so long to get there.  He was grazing in the back pasture.  There's no packing pasture.  All right.  There you go.  There you go.  Yeah.  You need to be working, sir.  Thanks.  You're welcome. 
[00:37:30]  You want to take number two?  Or not?  No.  But you'll hit it anyway.  Go ahead.  All right.  We'll take three instead.  Number three.  Chris in Jersey.  Chris?  Guys, you got to ease up on E-Rock.  He's probably mourning.  He's all sad.  He lost two family members yesterday.  Those whales, they died off the coast.  You're insinuating he's a whale.  That's just crazy.  That is.  Happy birthday, Jimmy.  Oh, we got a guy that works for a newspaper.  Adam in Newark.  Adam?  Yeah, hi. 
[00:38:00]  This is Adam from the Newark Associated Press.  I was wondering if we could use Eric Nagel's photos in an exclusive that we're doing featuring  random votes on unidentified bodies of water.  Would that be possible?  E-Rock, you got to put your photos back up.  Now they're very famous photos.  They are famous now.  You don't understand how this works.  They're up on oarundowns.com.  Oh, look at that.  Yeah, there's the debris. 
[00:38:30]  Oarundowns.com.  See, these are very famous photos now.  There's the debris.  Yeah.  Yeah.  The public domain?  Pretty much public domain, yes.  Sounds good.  Thank you.  He's going to use them.  Let's go to Dave in Tennessee.  Dave?  Yeah, I was just wondering why E-Rock was taking those pictures.  Where was Hoagie Boy in all this?  Why wasn't he down there trying to save those four people?  Yeah, it's true.  Hoagie Boy.  You are a superhero, E-Rock.  You're going to thwart that whole thing.  Oh, this guy wants to defend you.  Keith in Atlanta. 
[00:39:00]  Keith?  What's going on, fellas, man?  Hey, y'all leave E-Rock alone, man.  Yeah.  E-Rock, you the man, bruh.  I'm sitting here listening to this shit.  I don't appreciate any of these people fucking with you, man.  You do your job, telling your business, and fuck them, man.  Uppy, Anthony the Nazi, conehead ass, the other guy.  The other guy.  The other guy?  He's going to be on Jay Leno on a regular basis.  What the fuck?  Hey, I listen to the show, but I'm not going to even acknowledge the other guy. 
[00:39:30]  Oh, shit.  E-Rock, you the man.  Why are you up so early?  This morning.  Why are you up so early?  Dude, that could be the sickest fucking trick I've ever seen in my goddamn life that I just saw on TV.  Hey, look here, man.  The slip and slide off the ramp.  Watch this.  Hold on.  Well, we're watching.  We'll send the link to everybody.  No way.  Get the fuck out of here.  Fake.  Fake.  Fake.  How do you call it fake?  It's fake. 
[00:40:00]  Explain it.  CGI.  What was it?  A slip and slide?  Yeah, CGI.  Slip and slide down a hill.  That was much too far.  Then up a bike ramp, like a BMX kind of bike ramp.  He goes flying.  How many feet?  Into a mini pool.  It flies about 100 feet into a mini pool on the other side.  Yeah, come on now.  Where's the fakeness of it?  It's CGI.  Hell fucking no.  That guy could not have done that.  Why not?  It was too far for him to fly to land in that little fucking pool. 
[00:40:30]  No way.  They're showing it everywhere today.  I think you're wrong.  I actually think they're showing it everywhere today.  No.  They're showing it everywhere.  I don't care.  The news never gets tricked, Andy.  Fake.  I fake.  All right.  I'm not buying it.  Nope.  Sorry.  You want to leave now, E-Roc?  Right, E-Roc.  Are we done with this, or is there more callers?  Well, we're hoping for a better reaction, if you want to know the truth. 
[00:41:00]  I'm happy to get upset.  I didn't say we want him to get upset.  Just have a better reaction.  Missed the catapult into a pool.  No how, no way.  All right.  There goes E-Roc.  Never.  All right.  All right.  Let's see.  All right.  Could you autograph this?  The elephant picture.  What are you crazy?  You wanted to autograph the elephant picture.  I didn't have the guts to ask why we're sitting there.  That's hysterical. 
[00:41:30]  Oh, shit.  Oh, no.  He's back.  I think.  Is the sound on out there?  Oh, yeah.  Oh.  Is the sound on out there?  No.  Oh, okay.  Kept the door open.  Oh.  Why are you coming back?  I don't know.  I don't know.  You're addicted to the limelight.  Yeah.  Someone, SI.com, confirmed that as fake last week.  Sorry, oh, pretty cool, though.  God damn, man.  Damn, good job, man.  Yeah.  Very good job.  Oh, I spot him a mile away now.  So why the fuck is the news showing it as real today if it's already been.  Amazing water slide jump. 
[00:42:00]  Here's what it is.  Look, they're dousing it down.  Mm-hmm.  This is one of those things that look very real, but.  But how the fuck do you fake this?  It's CGI.  But he's up in the air.  He goes.  That arc, dude.  He goes way too far for the speed that he's traveling down outside.  Yeah, that's really fake.  So the guy's already in the pool.  It's a great job.  I mean, they did a good job on it, but.  I don't get it.  Yeah, it's all cut together.  Shaky cam CGI looks so good these days. 
[00:42:30]  Like, it just looks really good.  I know.  That's what it is, too.  They could get a nice shake on the camera.  I'll tell you why it's fake.  Why?  I have another way to.  His excitement with his buddies when he gets out of the kiddie pool.  I mean, you would be out of your mind if you pulled that off.  Yeah.  And he's just like, oh.  Go back a little.  Go slow down and see it.  Let's see when he.  Yeah, he's.  All right.  He's down the slip and slide.  Right.  Now he disappears behind something. 
[00:43:00]  Now that's just.  He disappears behind a little hill to get to the ramp.  Yeah.  That guy you saw in the tuck position was fake.  Look at him.  And then his friend's celebrating.  It's like.  And then, you know.  They're acting.  It's horrendous.  You think he goes down the hill.  And then when.  Like when he disappears behind the ramp.  That's where they fucking build a fake ramp.  Then CGI.  I got it.  Like that ramp isn't even real.  I bet that ramp is just CGI.  Now that guy right there isn't a real guy. 
[00:43:30]  What?  The guy in the air?  Either that or it was a green screen.  Like a dummy or something?  Yeah.  Or it was green screen.  Okay.  And then he hits the water and.  Yeah.  That's all like pieced together.  Huh.  It's layered.  Good job.  Very good, Anthony.  Wow.  Yeah.  There's no way you could do that.  That.  That is.  There's no way you can do that.  Jason in Connecticut.  How can you think that trick is real?  I saw it out of the corner of my eye while we're making fun of E-Rog.  I'm watching it. 
[00:44:00]  It looks real.  That's what CGI does.  It looks real.  Look, it's, you know, it proved me wrong very easily, so.  It's good.  I'm in with it now.  It looks very fake.  It's a good one.  The more you look at it.  All right.  Why don't we take our first break?  And we're going to get into the Hillary Clinton thing.  Oh, that's great.  I heard that on my way in on the news and fantastic.  It is great stuff.  Yeah.  If you haven't heard that Clinton clip yet, please stick around.  So much behind it.  There's so much being said in that clip. 
[00:44:30]  Absolutely.  And then something that kept Jimmy awake all night long.  Oh, how much that cost?  We'll get into that after the break as well.  Expensive?  What?  Something that kept you awake.  Yeah.  Oh, my God.  Is that real?  Yeah.  What's this?  It's, if you search YouTube for a MacBook Transformer.  Yeah.  It's just a good example of, you know, really good, you know, shaky cam CGI where it looks  like it's just somebody's home video.  And, you know, they got the modeling down pretty good.  Like the 3D modeling. 
[00:45:00]  That does look pretty goddamn good.  You know?  What the fuck?  That MacBook just flew out the window.  It just transforms into like a jet and flies out the window.  That's pretty cool.  That's cool.  But, you know, that's very reminiscent to me anyway of that water slide jump.  You can make anything look real.  There's also one that came out about a year ago of a UFO flying over some palm trees.  Oh, yeah.  That's right.  That one looked really cool.  UFO.  From Haiti. 
[00:45:30]  Haiti, was it?  Yeah.  How are we ever going to know if a UFO is real now?  I know.  How are we going to know if half this shit's real anymore?  Almost 10 million hits on this clip.  Look at this clip.  Yeah, this is the UFO Haiti clip.  That was a good one, though.  Yeah, this one looks really good.  It's fake, though, right?  Yeah.  How do you know it's fake?  The guy said it was?  Oh, yeah.  You can tell.  They dissect it.  The palm trees are made with a certain program, and they're the same trees.  If you pull back, you can see the branches are the same.  That's how they fucked up?  Look.  See?  Look at that.  See those two branches? 
[00:46:00]  And the other two branches?  That was how they fucked up, though, right?  But they got great scenery.  Every tree is the same?  Every tree is the same.  If the palm trees were different, then it would have been tougher to try to figure it out.  Look at that.  Look at the top of that one.  There's two spikes, and then a thick one out the right.  Two spikes, thick out the right.  Three palms coming off the right side.  Three palms off the right side.  What a rookie mistake.  If they had different palm trees, it would have been harder to figure it out.  You should have edited the palm trees a lot more, each one individually. 
[00:46:30]  Very cool.  That's fucking really well done, though.  It looks really good.  Shaky camera.  There's camera moves.  It's not just a still camera.  Right.  And the UFOs are moving kind of erratically.  And then the palm trees all look the same.  You're kidding me.  You put this whole thing together, and then you got the palm trees all looking the same.  You don't think anyone's looking at the trees?  You're looking at the flying saucers, and then all of a sudden...  Yeah, but if you're going to put a video up there, it gets 10 million hits.  Trust me, people are going to study this thing and try to figure shit out.  Yep.  And then somebody went, oh, dude, palm trees are all the same. 
[00:47:00]  Yeah.  All right, quick break.  We'll get into the Hillary Clinton thing.  The thing that kept Jimmy up all night.  This made you really angry, right?  Didn't you say that?  I'm trying to think.  I can't remember what it is.  You don't remember?  Oh, yeah.  It annoyed me so...  Okay, good, good, good.  Oh, that annoyed me.  All right, we'll get into it next.  Opie and Anthony, stay there.  Opie and Anthony, so the divers found the plane in the Hudson River with the body inside.  Yeah.  You know what they have to do to find dead bodies in the river? 
[00:47:30]  Sign side scanning radar and sonar.  I was, when I got to take that boat trip around Manhattan Island, you got to do that, by the way.  The NYPD wants you to do it bad.  Oh, yeah.  I was on the boat with one of the divers that did the job for years, and he said, first of  all, the Hudson River with the currents, we all know that, and then the visibility at  best is three feet.  In most cases, it's a foot.  So put your hand in front of your face about a foot. 
[00:48:00]  That's what you can see underwater about 30, 40 feet, and you're down there trying to find  a dead body.  He says it's all about just feeling around, and they set up lines and stuff, and you go  down the lines, and your whole job is just to feel until you feel what feels obviously  like a dead body, or in this case, the wreckage.  And then you got to kind of use your imagination going, okay, this is the wreckage, all right,  this is the front of the plane, okay, body's got to be in here somewhere, and you got to  reach in.  Could you imagine?  I guess 911 calls are available here. 
[00:48:30]  Yeah, we could get a few of those.  Yeah.  But could you imagine doing that job?  No.  Jumping in the water, and you could only see a foot to maybe three feet in front of you?  No, because then you're swimming, and you're face-to-face with the dead guy, his eyes are  eaten out.  You and I sit relatively close.  I wouldn't be able to see you underwater.  That's crazy.  I know.  I definitely wouldn't be able to see Jimmy, but now I have to find Jimmy.  You'd be missing out.  Underwater Jimmy.  Do you understand how creepy that would be?  Yes.  Extremely.  Especially for you, because you think there's monsters down there to begin with. 
[00:49:00]  There are monsters.  Actually, I feel like I'd kind of brave underwater, but I would be out of my mind, too.  Oh, monsters.  Imagine if they said, okay, we're going to go down to the bottom of the Hudson River.  You're not going to be able to see a thing, but just relax, and you'll be on a rope.  Me and you will be attached to a rope, and we'll get through this.  Just feel around.  Fuck no.  So we got that going on.  Then you got Obama saying Canadian health care system would not work in the U.S.  I'll tell you, this health care debate, you could hear the chatter wherever you go.  Chatter.  Are you hearing it? 
[00:49:30]  Chatter.  In your surroundings?  Yeah, everyone's talking about it.  You got people going, yes, yes, yes.  Other people are going, no, no, no.  Yes, yes, yes.  No, no, no.  Yeah.  Why is he saying the Canadian health care system would not work in the U.S.?  Because a lot of people, I guess because a lot of people are saying, are comparing what  Obama wants to do to the Canadian health care system?  Yeah, and because that is socialized medicine, and they don't want to make that comparison,  even though what Obama is kind of presenting to the American people is socialized medicine. 
[00:50:00]  Yeah.  Well, what system is he going to copy, then?  Are we going to make our own?  No one knows, really.  No one really knows yet.  I don't think he knows, even.  I think he realizes he's got some things to figure out here.  One of the red-eye topics last night was how, and it is amazing that the media does this,  all these people who are going up and protesting his, the old people, once again, and that fucking  Nancy Pelosi, she just sucks.  She's saying something that's un-American.  It's like, you fucking, really? 
[00:50:30]  It's amazing how the only protesters being called un-American or being shit on by the  media are protesters who are protesting anything to do with Obama.  Yeah.  They don't attack Ingrid Newkirk.  They don't attack Sharpton, who has been wrong about almost everything.  Yeah.  They don't attack any of these people.  But he doesn't really have a position.  Sharpton?  So I guess maybe they just let him slide.  They let him slide because he's black.  That's the only reason they let him slide.  That's the only reason they let him slide.  That's absolutely a valid point.  The only reason they let him slide is because he's black. 
[00:51:00]  They're terrified of the-  Ann Coulter didn't let him slide, but she could have been better on that debate.  I didn't see the debate.  I was not actually with her last night.  I did not see the Larry King debate.  I mean, she was impressive, but she held back a little bit.  How important are your gams?  What was the topic that they were debating?  Just everything.  You know, they were going with the current events and the Michael Jackson thing and, you  know.  Was Rivernell doing the laughing thing where he laughs off your statement no matter how accurate  it is?  Well, you know, how did you- 
[00:51:30]  But that's his move that we pointed out a long time ago.  So if Ann Coulter or anyone else debates this guy, you got to call him out on his move,  which is not to answer the question, the tough question that is presented to him.  Yeah.  He's a great debater and he's really good at deflecting.  Yeah, he's not a dummy.  And that's why he continues to be able to do what he does.  He's a three-card Monty dealer.  No one's calling him out on that.  I know.  You're right.  Call him out on it.  When is someone going to call him out on that, whether it's Larry King and Coulter or any  of these people that sit down with him? 
[00:52:00]  Like, wow, you're not answering- I would just keep going, you're not answering the question.  You didn't answer the question.  You're not answering the question.  I believe I answered the question.  Right.  What?  No, you didn't.  He's great at deflecting.  What was the question?  He's great.  He's just going around in circles.  So, all right.  And, oh, speaking of socialist.  Yes.  Socialist could be the new N-word, everybody.  Oh, is it?  Well, according to MSNBC.  Yeah.  Fucking socialists.  Every day I usually offer up a big thought and we call it the C-note. 
[00:52:30]  And today I want to talk about a word that we're hearing more and more, and that's the  word socialist.  You hear it from a lot of conservatives these days, usually critiquing the president or more  broadly Democrats, and while that certainly is a legitimate critique, there certainly  is an ideology that can and should be critiqued at certain times, it also sometimes is just  a kind of a generic conservative bludgeoning tool.  And that's all right, too, because you hear it on the Democratic side as well, right wing  nut, what have you.  But what concerns me is when in some of those town hall meetings, including the one that 
[00:53:00]  we saw in Missouri recently, where there were jokes made about lynching, et cetera, you  start to wonder whether, in fact, the word socialist is becoming a code word, whether or not  socialist is becoming the new N-word for, frankly, for some angry, upset birthers and others.  I hope that's not the case, but it sure does say to you what David Brooks said the other  day on TV, which is that more credible conservatives have to stand up and say that there's a line  that has to be drawn, that there's a line of responsibility that's important, and that  extends to the words that we choose, including how we use even legitimate words like socialists. 
[00:53:30]  I'm going to leave it there.  Holy shit, are they, the Democrats are fucking babies.  I, uh, I don't even know how to comment on that.  What?  Enough with the, attacking the grassroots, uh, uh, town hall meetings people are having.  They have them.  Yeah.  They had them to, because when they were pissed off at Bush, they're going to have them  when they're pissed off at Obama.  Stop being such fucking babies.  And, and, and wanting to just destroy words, throw words out. 
[00:54:00]  Like, they don't like the word socialist, but you know what?  If the shoe fits, uh, it's the new N-word.  Oh, is it?  Really?  I don't know about that.  I've never driven down the road angry and yelled socialist out the window.  I'll tell you that much.  I hope it is.  I've been looking for a new N-word.  Yeah, I know.  I'm so sick of the old one.  I want something new and exciting.  Oh, it's just repulsive. 
[00:54:30]  They're just whiners.  They just whine.  Yeah.  Yeah, that's what it's about.  Just, uh, stop.  Don't use this word.  Don't say this.  Don't do that.  When did it get so bad with this, uh, the separation, uh, of this country between the  two parties?  Like, it's really bad.  When did it, when did it get, when did it get to this level?  I mean, it was always there, but it's really bad now.  Fucking, uh, Lincoln?  I mean, don't you feel like it's really gotten a lot worse in the, maybe the last, I don't 
[00:55:00]  even know.  I want to put a number on it, maybe eight years or so.  I think when the press started getting really involved in, uh, uh, the, the, the finer points  of this with 24 hour news, you need to fill the time.  So you're really, um, exposing these people are trying to come up with stuff.  The country is so divided with the two parties at this point.  It really is.  Cause you remember a time when, all right, maybe your guy wasn't in office cause maybe  you're a Republican and there was a Democrat in there or whatnot. 
[00:55:30]  There was all, there was more common ground.  So it seemed.  Yeah.  It did seem.  Now it's like, don't even want to acknowledge cause your guy's not in there whatsoever.  Because I'll tell you what it is.  It's the mean.  And I'm not just saying it with Obama.  It certainly happened with, uh, with Bush as well.  Clinton, not so much.  Right.  And Clinton had sort of that middle ground that Republican, uh, conservatives hated Clinton.  Or did it start with Clinton?  Yeah.  You know what I'm trying to get out here?  Yeah. 
[00:56:00]  I'm trying to, when did it really, really get divided to the point we're at today?  Hmm.  What president and why?  Good one.  It was like in the sixties with Vietnam though.  I mean, when they went after Kennedy for, I mean, I think it was always, yeah, the doves  and the Hawks back then.  I think it was always there, but now it's, it's a lot more obvious because like  Gant said, there's so many news channels just, you know, yeah, really playing off of  it too.  They like that kind of, um, so it's just a perception that it's right.  It's a lot worse.  Every word you say is harped on and grabbed and then they present it to the other person. 
[00:56:30]  What do you think he said?  It's like they call people out on every single thought they have.  So that's, that's how it got worse.  I get all that.  So, but it's always been there, but it was just harder to get your point out because  there wasn't as many outlets.  Yeah.  And people weren't as petty.  Like, it just seems like we're such language obsessed, like, like little babies like that.  I mean, that guy wasn't even being a baby.  He was just questioning something, but like, you know, we've become so language obsessed  that, um, if one person says one incorrect thing, we harp on it. 
[00:57:00]  We make it more.  I don't think people are as language obsessed.  People are more likely to go, ah, I think it's a curse to have 24 hour, uh, news channels  because it's kind of like our show and we only do what, four or five hours and you find  yourself going, well, I got to admit something crazy because there's a lot of dead air here  today.  We got some time to fill.  So let me talk about this shit.  I never wanted to talk about on this radio show, but you let you feel the pressure like,  oh fuck, we better say something today.  Yeah.  And I bet you it's the same with the news channels, like, hey man, we got, we got some time 
[00:57:30]  to fill up here.  It's like, let's, uh, yeah, let's put somebody on that is angry with a word.  Right.  All right.  Now, you know, well, people are saying, right.  It's one guy.  And sure.  And then before you know it, people are very angry.  Uh, wow.  Okay.  Let's say hi to Will in North Carolina.  Will?  Words hurt.  Try the wine.  Hi, Will.  What's up, Will?  Well, I just wanted to say that MSNBC is kind of becoming an irrelevant news channel when  compared to CNN and Fox, because they had the whole Keith Overman thing, and then they 
[00:58:00]  had that whole health care thing where they had a whole week on it and only presented one  side of the argument.  Of course.  So it just kind of seems like MSNBC is just crap as compared to the other two.  Well, a lot of people, uh, watch that Keith Overman every night, so.  Yeah, that's a very biased channel.  Bill O'Reilly still beats him in the radios, though.  Yes, I believe he does.  Yeah.  Yeah, that's a pretty biased channel.  That's all I got.  A little bit of a liberal bias.  Which is fine.  It is what it is.  But isn't it amazing how they always cry about Fox? 
[00:58:30]  Like, not one entertainer, not one of these fucking babyish entertainers just acknowledges,  well, yeah, CNN's very slanted, and Fox is very slanted.  Like, everyone knows Fox News is slanted.  Yeah.  So what's the problem?  At least they're honest about being slanted.  They're not fucking babies.  Yeah, everybody picks on it.  Like, oh, yeah, why don't you go watch more Fox News?  Like NBC, like CBS, like CNN, their news isn't completely biased the other way, as far as being liberal. 
[00:59:00]  It's amazing, yeah.  It really is.  You gotta have a political point of view.  Like, you know what I mean?  Yeah.  That's just amazing to me.  The media.  Yeah, they really...  They're supposed to just report the news.  Yeah, isn't that how it started?  Now they're actually influencing opinion and...  Well, the only place they officially just report the news without comment is, like, local news, and you know how bad that shit is.  Yeah, it's horrible.  They're just reading, and then they do some silly morning zoo-type fucking stunt in between newscasts. 
[00:59:30]  Yeah, they'll put on cheerleaders or have some exercise guy come in or some bullshit.  Right.  Let me go to Chris in Pennsylvania.  Chris.  Hey, guys.  Hey.  I think when you asked, you asked about when it started, and I really think it started with Clinton, because the guy moved to the center.  He took away...  He basically pushed people off welfare, right?  He said abortion, safe, rare, you know, and legal.  And, you know, left the Republicans only pushed themselves out to the, you know, pushed out to the extremes. 
[01:00:00]  I don't believe that started with Clinton.  Are you kidding me?  The animosity...  Again, the news channels have amped up in the last few years, but it didn't start with Clinton, dude.  It's been there since...  Well, yeah.  If you remember when Reagan was running for president, the Democrats and liberals were really telling people,  look, if you elect this guy, there will be a major war.  No.  He will get us into a major war with the Soviet Union.  It could be atomic war. 
[01:00:30]  So that division was there for years.  But do you guys think it was that vitriolic?  I mean, do you really, like, you know, where words were being banned?  Um, no, the whole word thing has come from this oversensitivity, and I'm sorry, you gotta blame that on the left.  Yes.  They are great at coming out and saying that this is hurtful to people, and it's like, no one gives a shit.  Right, they are the PC police. 
[01:01:00]  You can't ban words in America.  Like, I don't understand why we're just allowing this to happen.  I don't know either, guys.  Gotta run.  The right is just as bad, but, you know, they're more with religious and family value.  And they're the same full of shit people, too.  All right.  So this story that kept me up, they're actually interviewing somebody on the news.  Oh, yeah.  The party separated after 9-11? 
[01:01:30]  No.  No.  All right.  They actually get together after 9-11.  I'm just reading some of these.  For, like, three seconds.  Yeah, for a day or two, right?  That's Josh in D.C.  Well, let's go with this guy, Greg in New Hampshire.  Greg.  Hey, guys.  Hey.  Greg.  When Newt Gingrich, you know, got the House elected to do the contract with America to  be more right-wing conservative, that's when the liberals really started.  Yeah, I think, yeah, the Newt Gingrich thing, boy, people didn't like him at all. 
[01:02:00]  He's not likable.  I just feel there was a catalyst somewhere along the way that really, really separated  the two parties big time.  They were always separate.  We all understand that.  People didn't like Nixon very much.  But there just seemed to be more of a gray area and more of a common ground than there  is today.  They hated Nixon.  I think it was there, but now you see it more.  Yeah, like you said, the perception because of all the news channels and what's not.  Special interest groups are bigger now.  They have a bigger influence, so you have to be more definite and defined in everything  you said. 
[01:02:30]  Yeah, with the web, too.  I mean, you know, everyone's got an opinion, and there it is.  Bloggers are being quoted on legitimate, well, as legitimate as they are, news services.  All right.  Well, people have their opinions when it started, but we can move on, I guess.  Opinions are like assholes.  Everyone's got one.  It's regular Anthony.  Atta boy.  Oh, regular Jim.  Let me go to Joe in Buffalo.  Joe.  Poon and Peter.  Poon and Peter in the morning.  Ah.  What's going on, Tony?  Hey.  Hey, Joe. 
[01:03:00]  Hey, Martin.  Hey, listen.  That Stuart Scott was on Sportsman this morning.  Yeah.  And they were showing some, like, you know, wacky stunt that, like, this white guy did  where he, like, flew into a big puddle of water.  Oh, yeah.  We were talking about that.  Yep.  Yeah.  And he did the whole, you know, you know, you don't see a brother doing that.  Now, why is that okay?  I just want to know.  That's a very good question, because a white guy says something like that, or, you know,  the opposite statement of that, you would be fired.  Yeah, you'd get in trouble.  And then Scott said a brother would never do that.  Stuart Scott Black?  Oh, yeah. 
[01:03:30]  And there's nothing wrong with him saying that.  That's fine.  Oh, I don't care.  He's just joking around, but it's the idea.  You're right.  The opposite would be good.  Yeah, I don't give a shit.  Everyone should be able to say whatever the fuck they want.  That's where I come from.  But if it's a white guy saying something similar, he would definitely be fired for that statement.  Sure.  We'll have to apologize.  I didn't mean that black people wouldn't do that.  I'm sure they love water.  Right.  Yeah, exactly.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I don't remember the name of his co-anchor, but I believe he said something along the lines  of, I believe there is truth to that statement, but I think it's better that  you say that instead of I.  He said that?  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  I don't know. 
[01:04:00]  I don't know.  Maybe it was Trey Wingo.  I don't know exactly.  But I thought that was, he said it kind of flatly, you know, kind of just, you know,  almost like upset that that's what, how things have kind of panned out, you know, lately.  There's absolutely a double standard.  We've discussed that ad nausea on this show.  Oh, yeah.  Thank you, sir.  White people are just dumb.  All right.  Punch it out.  All right.  Moving on.  Some white people.  We got the Clinton thing.  We got to get into this.  Speaking of politics, this is a good segue.  Yeah.  We all know that Bill Clinton saved those two reporters from North Korea. 
[01:04:30]  Yep.  He was a superstar.  Went over there and didn't say a word.  He had a downplay because he knew if he talked, he would make the situation worse.  Even though it didn't matter if he talked or not, he was on the news as the face of the  person, you know, the face of the one that saved these two journalists.  And meanwhile, this is a, you know, a job for somebody else.  Maybe the administration.  It kind of made, kind of made the administration look weak and silly.  Um, as it did when Jesse Jackson had to go over and get those people from, uh, where the 
[01:05:00]  hell were they?  Um.  Were they in the Sudan?  No?  I, I, I.  Were they servicemen he got out?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  I don't remember.  I want to say.  I'm almost thinking it was Libya.  Libya?  Yeah, you're probably right.  I'm sorry.  I've been Libya.  Yeah.  Yeah.  It could have been.  But, uh, that made, um, I, I believe, was that during Reagan, perhaps?  I'm not sure either.  I don't know.  Boy, I'm full of facts today, ain't I? 
[01:05:30]  Well.  Uh, but it made the administration look bad.  Like, they couldn't do anything, but Jesse Jackson goes over there and brings him back,  and, and he looked like the hero.  Uh, this is the same thing.  It made the administration look bad.  And, and especially Hillary Clinton, who's the Secretary of State, she's supposed to  be the one that does the communicating with, uh, other countries.  She was completely out of this one.  Out of it.  She's, she's doing African dances.  Yeah, I was, I was, uh, in Africa. 
[01:06:00]  I was taking a little peek at this story as it was developing, and I, not once did I,  I hear Hillary make a statement about it or anything that, that I can remember.  Maybe she did, and.  Yeah.  I, I just don't remember one, though.  So, uh, it finally came to a head yesterday, uh, a student accidentally asked Hillary Clinton  about her husband because of translator's mistake.  Oh, they're blaming the translator on this?  It was translator's mistake.  Yeah, the translator, uh, actually was supposed to say what, uh, how does, uh, President Obama  feel about these issues? 
[01:06:30]  And the translator said, how does President Clinton feel about certain issues?  Oh, wow.  And she, she goes off, and it's so telling, the tone of her voice, what she's saying, it's  so telling that she is so fucking sick of her husband and having to talk about him.  But meanwhile, he's the fucking president, was the president.  She wouldn't be anywhere near where she is now if it wasn't for him being the president  and her being the first lady for eight years.  Uh, and, and she's, she is disgusted with answering questions about him. 
[01:07:00]  And on the heels of him going over there and getting those two journalists back, she exploded.  And it's obvious that she hates this and does not even like her husband.  You get the feeling that she's in over her head.  You get the feeling that she might just step down.  Yeah.  I'd like to see her actually do something.  I get the feeling that she's just, uh, more than willing to, to step down eventually  from this position.  There's all kinds of problems going on in the world.  Uh, at least one thing you could say about Condoleezza Rice, she was always in hot spots. 
[01:07:30]  She was going to areas in the world where there were problems and talking with, uh, foreign  dignitaries about, uh, problems that are going on.  Uh, meanwhile, Hillary is in Africa doing some wacky African dance.  Uh, how is that helping, uh, our, our, our situation around, around the globe?  Leave Africa alone.  Just leave it alone.  We can't though.  This country just can't. 
[01:08:00]  Just leave it.  Even Bush was there banging on the, uh, the drum.  Oh, I know.  All, everyone feels compelled to go over there.  I saw the montage yesterday.  Even, even President Bush was having fun with the drums.  Yeah.  Uh, well, this is Hillary.  If you haven't heard yet, it's, it's amazing audio.  We've all heard about the Chinese contracts in this country.  The interferences from the World Bank against this contract.  What does Mr. Clinton think through the mouth of Mrs. Clinton? 
[01:08:30]  And what does Mr. Mitt Mutombo think on this situation?  Thank you very much.  Wait, you want me to tell you what my husband thinks?  My husband is not the Secretary of State.  I am.  Oh.  So you ask my opinion.  I will tell you my opinion.  I'm not going to be channeling my husband.  What a, oh, man.  The tone of voice there. 
[01:09:00]  I'm not going to be channeling my husband.  That hit a nerve.  You're not going to be fucking him either.  That's your problem.  That hit a nerve.  She's been hearing the whispers.  Oh, yeah.  She's been hearing the whispers around her.  Oh, yeah.  That, that was a little too, uh.  That was very telling.  Oh, yeah.  She is so aggravated with what he did, uh, getting those journalists back from North Korea.  You think they had a conversation?  She was basically saying, please don't do this to me.  Don't do this.  You don't think they need to talk?  They don't even talk anymore.  They barely.  When was the last time you saw them together? 
[01:09:30]  I, I can't even tell you.  Well, she's busy traveling the world.  Yeah, she's doing African dances.  For some kind of fucking reason that I have no clue what that is about when politicians go over there.  Just leave that.  That's a money pit.  You know when you buy a shitty house?  They call it a money pit because you just dump money into it and nothing gets fixed.  That's what Africa is.  It's the world's money pit.  Leave it.  Just let fucking nature take its course.  I'm sorry.  But it's a horrible place full of horrible, uh, people. 
[01:10:00]  How do you know it's a horrible place?  That don't take care of, you watch the news.  You've been there?  Look at, look at, uh, uh, the web.  See what's happening in, in places like, uh, uh, Liberia.  The Congo?  The Congo.  Uh, the Sudan.  Um, uh, the fucking, uh, Somalia.  Where part of their, part of the war is that they mutilate women's genitals.  It's a fucking horrendous, horrendous place.  The biggest, uh, uh, the biggest criminals as far as genocide goes are in Africa. 
[01:10:30]  And it's all warlords and we're going to kill this group that's, you know, over this border  that really doesn't even exist.  And then we just keep pumping money because it makes, it makes politicians look like they're  caring and doing something.  Right.  Stupid fat fucking Oprah opens up a school over there.  She opens a fucking school for girls. 
[01:11:00]  Well, something good.  Meanwhile.  I said she's trying to.  Meanwhile, it was a rape haven.  It was a rape school.  How did we get this stupid fat Oprah?  Because she's another one that's just pumping money over there thinking it's going to help.  You can't just fix that problem with money.  It's got to help in some way.  No, it doesn't.  It turned into rape school.  Giving a place where these girls could go and learn?  Rape school.  It was a place where men could go and rape young women.  So they didn't do proper background checks. 
[01:11:30]  I'm sure they fixed that problem.  And it's also racist because there are white people in that, white children in that area  that could use an education.  And the school is entirely filled with black women, young black women.  And not one white young woman goes to that school.  I mean, what's the deal there?  What's the criteria?  You have to be black and you have to be willing to have crimes committed against you? 
[01:12:00]  Horrible.  You can't fix that shit with money.  And we dump so much fucking money over the AIDS research?  Stop it.  We've been pumping money for AIDS over there for how many fucking years with education?  And there's still fucking virgins thinking that that's going to cure their AIDS.  It's amazing.  It really is.  Do they not want to wear condoms?  No.  I mean, no one does.  But, you know.  Yeah.  But, you know, if it was like that here, Jesus, where every other woman's got AIDS, boy, wrap 
[01:12:30]  that fucker up in bubble wrap.  The fucking message is out.  People know about AIDS.  Stop it.  It's just, if they don't want to wear condoms, enough already with trying to make a culture  or a group of people do what they don't want to do.  Yeah.  Enough with the U.S. sticking our fucking dumb faces in everywhere.  Nature will take its course.  And whatever is going to happen is going to happen over there.  Maybe it's a step in Africa's continuing evolution or something. 
[01:13:00]  But Oprah's over there making a difference.  She's cutting a ribbon for her rape school.  Yeah.  Better than cutting a clit.  I'll give you that one.  It's probably the same scissor that's been used on many clitoris.  Jesus.  Let's go to Stryker.  Stryker.  Hey, boys.  Hey.  I wonder if you guys caught the story of Bill Clinton's 63rd birthday party, which could explain  why Hillary was so pissed. 
[01:13:30]  You know, Obama said there would be no more Vegas trips for executives, but apparently  that doesn't apply to the Democratic Party holding a birthday party for Clinton, which  held at the Kraft Steakhouse in Vegas, where it was around $300 to $500 per person.  Really?  Well, who paid the bill, though?  It could be over $100,000 was spent by the Dems on Clinton's party.  Was it the Democrats or was it private investors now?  You got to be... 
[01:14:00]  It was Harry Reid and the Democratic Party.  Well, who paid for it?  The Democratic Party and Harry Reid.  Did they?  Okay.  Yeah.  How do you know that?  I'm not saying you're wrong.  I'm just asking you to know that.  It's in the media.  All right.  Sorry, I was just reading something.  What happened?  About Oprah?  About Oprah's rape school.  It's not Oprah's rape school.  It's not Oprah's rape school.  Oprah Winfrey's elite boarding school for girls in South Africa has been rocked by its second  sex scandal in fewer than two years. 
[01:14:30]  Seven students were suspended last week, that's in March, for sexually harassing their schoolmates.  As the Africans on Sunday newspaper reported, one 15-year-old was accused of preying on  another pupil and forcing other girls to lie to investigators about it, the paper reported.  You have been found guilty of physical contact of a sexual nature with another pupil on campus.  Harassment, bullying other girls on campus and being dishonest by not telling investigators  the whole truth.  A letter to her parents read other girls were caught fondling each other or trying to get 
[01:15:00]  other girls to join them in lesbian liaisons, the paper reported.  All right.  So now this is hot, right?  Now the story gets hot.  How old are they?  That's just normal behavior at all-girls schools.  Ah, 15.  In school.  Fondling each other.  Keep your hands off each other and fucking learn.  Go to school.  Learn how to dig an aqueduct.  Fucking A. 
[01:15:30]  Do you know what a not fun guy at the party who just sounded like?  Keep your hands off each other, learn to dig an aqueduct.  You whores touching each other's tits.  That's when you go to see if there's any more beer left in the keg.  Yeah, learn to dig an aqueduct.  Good seeing you.  I am an ass.  He's like Duvall and fucking Sling Blade just sitting there in a chair.  Learn to dig an aqueduct.  Stefano, see, from New York writes, striker's a fucking idiot.  The Democratic Party didn't pay for it.  Holy shit, this show's a joke right now.  Huh? 
[01:16:00]  Because of the Hillary, the Bill Clinton Vegas Party thing.  Well, why don't you call in with your correct information, stir?  Yeah.  Stir.  Stir.  That's sir with a T.  Stir.  That's a very official, sir.  Yeah, we'll try to get Stefano C. on the air.  Jesus, are you crazy, Dan?  Dan in Arizona, go ahead.  Hey.  Hey.  Why don't you go over and take a survey on how much of those people in Africa want to come  over and pick our cotton and get out of that hole hole?  Oh, Jesus. 
[01:16:30]  Wow.  See.  Well, I don't think...  I don't think cotton picking is even a really...  Is that even a fucking viable industry anymore?  I know.  I think they made a machine.  Yeah.  I think Eli Whitney invented the cotton gin.  And we all know we have enough socialists in this country already.  Ba-da-ba-ba-da-ba-ba.  Ba-da-ba-ba.  All right.  So there you go.  The Hillary Clinton thing.  You want to move on to that thing that kept Jimmy up all night?  Oh, yes.  It annoyed me.  Just more shitty customer service.  It is annoying.  From an airline. 
[01:17:00]  More shitty customer service.  It's your airline, though, Jimmy.  You turned us all on to Continental years ago.  It's amazing how poorly airlines respond to people.  It's almost like an arrogance.  Like, we know you have to fly.  Put number six on.  You still had two?  Yeah, yeah.  All right.  We'll get back to you in a sec, Jimmy.  Mike in Tampa.  Yeah.  Mike.  Go ahead.  Give me hell.  Heck.  Yeah.  Being an Italian, you should know you can't dig an aqua dump.  They're above ground. 
[01:17:30]  You've got to build them.  Really?  Then what's a viaduct?  What's a viaduct?  You fucking asshole.  He hung up.  Yeah, he certainly did.  No one has ever asked, what's a viaduct like that before?  Ever.  On the radio.  You're the first one ever.  No one has ever asked that question.  You're an innovator.  Do you know, I listen to the replay sometimes, and I cannot believe that it's really me. 
[01:18:00]  I am a fucking lunatic.  It's like sitting with a crazy person.  It really is.  All right.  Let's see.  What is the difference?  A viaduct carries a railway.  No, viaduct also carries water.  I don't know.  Whatever.  I think an aqueduct can be anything.  It was still a good line.  It's a racetrack.  I enjoyed it as a good line that would wreck a party.  Who cares what the actual meaning is? 
[01:18:30]  As long as I can yell.  Yeah, you know how fucking early it is?  Leave us alone.  All right, Jimmy.  So this customer service airline thing bothered you.  We had an incident with Kenny on Continental recently where he was upgraded to first class.  Nice.  And then they kicked him out of first class.  Not nice.  I think because they sold the ticket.  He had a bulkhead ILC because he's 6'4".  He is a bulkhead.  Yeah, he is a real lunkhead in the bulkhead.  And then what they do is they put him back in coach and they will refuse to give him back 
[01:19:00]  his seat.  So they upgrade the guy.  They boot him out and they refuse to give him back his bulkhead ILC.  They give it to a little old lady who's tiny and they say, well, we can't have a domino.  It's almost like we've screwed you out of your seat.  Yeah.  And now we're not going to inconvenience another person.  It's despicable.  Oh, that is.  Customer service.  I got a worse story.  Remember when I was left behind in Atlanta? 
[01:19:30]  They actually closed the door on my face.  Where are you going to remember that?  I forgot the details.  We flew down maybe to work in radio down in Atlanta.  And somehow I think our flight was canceled or they overbooked.  Something was going on.  So we got on the next flight on standby.  So I think there was four of us at the time.  Was it that trip?  Yeah, I think it was.  There was four of us and we all got on.  Good news.  All guys got seats.  We all sit down nice.  The plane is packed.  It's ready to take off. 
[01:20:00]  All of a sudden the stewardess comes and grabs just me.  He goes, follow me, sir.  I'm like, all right, cool.  Follow me.  You know.  And I walk off the plane.  Must be in the front row.  They're like, we made a mistake.  We don't have a seat for you on this flight.  I'm like, what are you?  But I was just sitting in one.  As I'm saying, what are you talking about?  Next thing you know, I'm off the plane.  And they're closing the door in my face because they got a schedule to keep to.  They don't want to argue with you in your seat is what it was.  And I looked at it and he's in a tiny little window.  And I'm like, help me. 
[01:20:30]  My luggage is on the plane.  Everything.  Did you get back on the plane?  No.  I'm just like, bye.  I'll be home.  And they back out.  And I'm just sitting there like, what the fuck happened?  I was in my seat comfortable.  What happened to Opie?  And now I'm off the plane and the door, they literally shut it in my face.  Yeah.  And then they're like, I don't know.  They'll talk to you and figure something out.  And, you know, my pal takes off.  Everybody else takes off.  I looked out the window.  I'm like, there he is in the terminal.  I'm just like, what happened?  There's Opie in the terminal. 
[01:21:00]  Look.  No explanation except, come with me.  Come with me.  Sorry.  You don't have a seat.  And that was it.  How long did you have to wait?  And it wasn't their problem because they had to get this flight going.  How long did you have to wait?  It would be good if I said, you know, days or something.  No, no.  A couple hours.  Yeah.  You know what I like?  It was like two or three hours.  They did get me on the next flight, but it was like, what the fuck?  You know what I like?  The fact that I was able to pull the armrest up and just lay down in the two seats.  It was fantastic.  It probably was you.  You probably fucking bought two seats. 
[01:21:30]  But that was, I think you guys told me you flew down on a small airline.  Oh, no.  That was the first time where they painted over the old value jets.  Value jets, yeah.  And said, no, we fixed the problem because we gave the planes a new paint job.  If you remember the value jet.  Yeah, sure, sure.  The one went down in the swamp in Florida.  Yes.  And instead of like, you know, getting rid of all those planes, they just gave it a nice  paint job and changed the logo.  Well, this was, it was so despicable the way Kenny was treated.  It's almost like you fly to become an elite, right? 
[01:22:00]  And then you're elite and you've kept your part of the bargain.  I've showed loyalty to your airline.  Yes.  So part of the reward of having showed loyalty is an upgrade.  And they boot him out.  And the people at the gate would, oh, it was enraging.  And the guy's like, well, they shouldn't be doing this automatically.  This is what the gate agent is telling me because I'm talking to the guy that goes, well,  your friend had an attitude.  I'm like, my friend got booted out of his seat.  And then my friend wasn't allowed to sit in his bulkhead seat.  My friend's six foot four.  I was really aggravated.  Like the nerve of this guy to say my friend had an attitude. 
[01:22:30]  He got an attitude.  Yes, he did.  And he, well, he should.  And he goes, I'm going to, I'm going to put a mark on his account.  Good.  You do that.  He didn't say that.  Oh, yes, he did.  I'm going to put some kind of a mark on his account.  Like they're so arrogant in their customer service.  They can't believe he had the right to be livid that he was being screwed.  Of course.  Because they know you have to fly.  Wow.  What a fuck.  That's amazing.  Fuck.  A customer service.  I mean, it's non-existent at this point.  But it's frustrating when it's an airline on the continental, when you deal with them 
[01:23:00]  all the time, it's just frustrating because you're showing a certain amount of loyalty.  You don't expect them.  Look, people have, mistakes happen.  To me, the real sin they committed, I should be slapped for saying that, was the fact that  they wouldn't give him back his bulkhead seat.  Like, all right, they sold the seat.  Maybe another flight had gotten canceled.  It was a mix up.  They wouldn't just apologize, give him a little voucher for the inconvenience, and give him  back his bulkhead seat.  Why didn't they move the little old lady to that seat?  Because that would require somebody taking charge and going, look, we wronged this guy. 
[01:23:30]  He's an elite member.  He had this seat.  They want to do the least amount of work possible regardless of how it affects the customer.  And they don't give a shit that Kenny's, what, 6'5", 250, something like that.  Oh, he's 6'5"?  Okay.  So he's 6'5", 250.  So, I mean, it would take one look at Kenny to realize, wow, we've got to give him his  bulk seat back so he's comfortable.  Had they done that until...  To them, it's like, no big deal.  It's seat to seat.  But it's bullshit when you're looking at Kenny.  He does need special seating on these planes to be comfortable. 
[01:24:00]  He's special.  Had they done that and said, look, we're sorry.  We sold the seat because we had a flight canceled.  It's been a tremendous day.  Here's a little voucher for the inconvenience.  It's like, that's all people have to do to make you feel better.  Like, okay, at least they're looking out for me.  Yep.  Well, the thing that upsets me the most is the guy said I had a bad attitude.  Well.  Because, you know, you can't say nothing to those people or they won't even let you on  the plane.  No, now they have all the power in the world where if you say something, they'll be like,  well, this guy's got an attitude.  We can't have him on a plane, so...  Well, I know how to be a problem. 
[01:24:30]  And I wasn't a problem at that point.  He wasn't.  He was just...  Kenny was just stuck up for himself.  And they are so not used to somebody actually calling them out accurately on what they did wrong.  You know what happened?  Jimmy and I like to board, like, first and get on and get comfortable.  You know, because, as Jimmy said, we are elite members.  That's right.  Being...  I was in first class as well.  And being a gentleman, I like to board and have a tomato juice while I boo all the people  going to coach.  You drink... 
[01:25:00]  I sit there and I go, boo, don't make eye contact with me.  James, you drink tomato juice.  Yeah, what do they say?  Tomato.  Oh, tomato juice, yes.  Yeah, well, that is for a fancy gentleman.  And it's amazing.  I was upgraded, but it's amazing how fast I forget where I came from.  I was supposed to be in coach with Dumbbell here, and the minute they upgraded me, I forgot  exactly where I came from.  And you forgot that you were even with Kenny.  Oh, who is this lunkhead?  Be gone, tall creep.  I didn't get an upgrade till, like, that morning, like a couple hours before the flight. 
[01:25:30]  So I was like...  You must have been very excited.  Yeah, but I would have been just as happy in my balkhead aisle.  That's like the first row of last class.  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah, and I would have been close to, you know, Jimmy.  But so we're the first two boarding, and they take my boarding pass, and they go, oh, here  he is, go see her.  And she's standing at the desk right next to the thing.  Oh, shit.  And she's going, uh, uh, there's been a problem, you were upgraded, but we sold your  seat instead, so here's your ticket. 
[01:26:00]  So now I look, and now I'm, like, in a regular seat where, like, no leg room, no nothing.  So all I did was say, well, can't I just have my old seat back?  And they're going, no, that's going to cause a domino effect.  No, you switch one with the other.  I says, well, you should have thought about that before you got greedy and sold my ticket.  Yeah.  Don't give the upgrade.  Don't encourage people to be elite, and then when you upgrade them, uh, sell the seat.  Don't encourage, he kept his part of the bargain by being loyal to one airline. 
[01:26:30]  It's just.  How is taking an old hag, putting her in, uh, your seat, and you taking your original seat  back a domino effect?  Yeah.  Doesn't it have to, like, keep going?  Nah.  So then I asked him, what about emergency row?  No, that wasn't available.  So I was like, all right, you know, there's nothing I can do.  So I says, can I have my old, uh, boarding pass back?  Because I wanted to write a letter, and I wanted the, the proof, the evidence, right?  Oh, fuck that.  They had ripped it up and put it in the garbage. 
[01:27:00]  They go, it's in the garbage.  They go, well, can I have it?  I'd like to have it.  They go, we're not picking through the garbage.  I go, my luggage tag is on that boarding pass.  I'd like to have my luggage tag in case something happens.  Hey, you don't need it.  The number's on the thing.  You know, where are we supposed to stop the boarding process to accommodate you?  I go, you can do that, and you can do this, you know?  It's no puzzle to figure out.  See, you're making problems.  And you ask for a pen.  He asks for a pen.  So then I go, I go, I go, oh, you guys are all about customer service, huh? 
[01:27:30]  And that, you could see it in their eyes.  That's when it took the turn, right?  That's when you had your attitude.  Yeah, I go, could you write down your names because I'm going to write a letter.  So the one lady, she wrote down her name, and then the guy taking the tickets, I go,  could you write down your name?  I asked the lady, could you write down his name?  No, he can write his own name.  So I go, sir, could you write your name?  He goes, no, that's why we wear name tags.  So I said, miss, she had the pen in her hand because she just wrote her name.  I said, miss, could you write down his name or could I borrow your pen? 
[01:28:00]  No, you can't borrow my pen.  That's, these are people working at the gate at the airline.  Un-fucking-believable.  And that's when I saw that they wrote down my name.  Uh-oh.  You know?  Oh.  So, you know, because the best defense is a good offense.  Yes.  You know, so I dug a pen out of my bag.  I wrote down his stupid name.  Oh, you got the names?  Yeah.  The thing, see, one thing, Kenny, is as being an ex-detective, he really has his facts correct  and that annoys people.  Yeah. 
[01:28:30]  It annoys people.  But this is all a tangent because there's another example of just mistreating passengers  and this is how we got off on this subject, was the story of last night.  The Continental Express.  The people that got stuck on the plane overnight.  Yeah, let's get into this new story.  Another great example of customer service and the customer coming first and being taken  care of.  But it's like this is frustrating because most people are not able to talk about this stuff  on the air and that's why we do when it happens because everybody deals with this kind of crap 
[01:29:00]  and you get so sick of it, you get so tired of talking to, like, just a robot to not talking  to somebody who goes, oh, yeah, that was kind of a screw-up on our part.  Let me help you out with that.  Did you get their names, though, and write your letter?  I didn't write the letter.  You should write the letter.  Write the letter.  Write the letter.  Write the letter.  You can't fight City Hall.  I've written letters.  They've actually gotten things done.  I know.  What an asshole.  But, you know, the way they pack you in in the back of that plane is like criminal.  Yeah, it really is.  Yeah.  You're right.  It is.  They do that. 
[01:29:30]  Thank you, Aunt Kenny.  It's criminal.  It's criminal.  It's like sardines.  Let's get to the Continental story that got Jimmy very annoyed last night.  The whole thing is so ridiculous.  It's inexcusable.  Continental flight 2816, operated by Express Jet Airlines, took off from Houston, bound for MSP.  Stormy weather forced the plane to be diverted to Rochester.  Okay.  Once there, the aircraft sat on the tarmac for six hours.  There has to be another way of dealing with people like that.  Passengers claimed the conditions were miserable, with babies crying and a stench coming from the toilets. 
[01:30:00]  But the airline, citing the fact that security had gone home for the night, made everyone stay on the plane.  Holy shit.  Can you believe that?  Yes, I can.  Continental Express, our 51 seat, I believe, Embraer Jets.  Yeah.  And to sit on that thing for six hours.  It doesn't have a seat.  It's one row of seats on one side, two seats on the other.  And they are those small seats. 
[01:30:30]  They don't really recline more than three inches.  It is, yeah.  And the seats are kind of hard.  They're not even like nice, cushy seats.  Very uncomfortable and made for a short hop.  And they're saying that the plane smelled like dirty diapers.  And one of the stories, I...  Well, the bathroom started really stinking.  Yeah, yeah.  So the dirty diapers means there was kids on there.  Babies, yeah.  Screaming, they're fucking, you know, they're not pleasant if they haven't eaten every 15 minutes.  I'd have fucking done what the woman did in the last episode of Match with the chicken. 
[01:31:00]  And they said that you should...  The Continental diverted their comments.  They said people complained to them to go talk to Express Jet.  Now we should talk to you.  Your name is on the side of the...  I don't care if it's being operated by Express Jet.  In partnership with...  Yeah.  Your name's on the side of the plane.  You allow them to put their miles into your elite status.  So how about you field the complaints?  Yep.  And what were they supposed to do if security went home?  I'm just trying to, like, play this out. 
[01:31:30]  I don't know.  Obviously, you got it.  Giving people the option of leaving if they wanted to.  Yeah, you got to get the people off the plane.  You can't expect them to sit six hours on the tarmac.  Yeah.  Or find a way to get security there.  Do something.  Have the captain call somebody at TSA.  Yeah, maybe make some emergency phone calls.  Or fly somewhere else.  How about that?  Take off and land somewhere else.  Right.  Yeah, they...  Six hours.  They left him there six hours on a small plane.  If you're in a nice big jet for six hours, you know, a cross-country flight... 
[01:32:00]  Sure.  ...you're kind of uncomfortable.  Ansy.  How about this?  We could barely sit here for four hours.  Oh, please.  I know.  Think about that.  And we got this shit smell coming from Jimmy every...  I get nervous.  We're in a very similar situation.  Wow, I never thought of that.  Here's the second half of the story.  We had space available to them.  Security was not an issue.  Acclaimed the airport manager in Rochester disputes.  If it were my decision to make, those people would have never sat out there on the tarmac for that length of time. 
[01:32:30]  But it is not an airport decision.  It wasn't a security issue.  It's strictly an airline issue.  Local aviation expert Terry Tripler tells us that currently passengers caught in a nightmare scenario like this  don't have a lot of recourse.  Their excuses are absolutely a joke.  But as consumers, he says, they can fight back by flying with someone else.  Continental says they're sorry.  No, they're not.  If they were sorry, something like this would have never happened in the first place. 
[01:33:00]  So great, great public relations, Continental.  They're taking a beating.  Good.  Yeah, they really are.  After having dealt with that...  That's why I mentioned Kenny's situation.  After having dealt with that recently and seeing the way...  And I talked to the guy after the guy who had dealt with Kenny.  He goes, your friend had an attitude because he happened to come in the plane.  I'm like, my friend got really kind of screwed over there.  And I had a very civil discussion with him.  But I could just see the arrogance.  It's like you're not scolding a petulant boy.  You're scolding an ex-detective who knows what he's talking about and who is screwed out of his seat 
[01:33:30]  because your airline didn't fulfill its promise to keep his upgrade.  And what do you mean knows what he's talking about?  He's an expert flyer.  How many flights has Kenny...  Flown, booked...  I would love to know how many flights Kenny has been on.  Or been involved with.  Does he know about...  Booking flights and...  Knowing that OCD freak, he knows about how many flights he's...  You don't know?  A lot.  Don't come in and bore everybody.  Because he's...  Thank you.  And the flights that he doesn't take, the ones he books for me.  He books every flight I take. 
[01:34:00]  He books everyone's flights on this show.  I mean, everyone's.  He's an expert flyer is what I'm getting at.  It's enraging to have dealt with that.  And to be dealt with, yeah, just treated like a piece of shit.  Let me go to Dave in Kansas City.  And I believe that they lied.  Good for the airport manager to stick up and say that wasn't our fault.  Security was not an issue.  Yeah.  It's incompetence.  Stupid liars.  They just didn't know what the fuck to do.  They didn't know what to do.  David in Kansas City.  Go ahead.  Morning, boys.  Hey, David.  Hey, a couple years ago, I won a AirTran Airways thing for an XM contest or one of those surveys. 
[01:34:30]  And I was flying into Atlanta and taking another flight out.  Well, we got to the gate about 15 minutes before the flight.  They had a drunk guy that they had to take off the plane.  And they closed the gate and were taken off.  And I'm looking at the airplane leaving.  And the guy's like, we got a problem here.  And I said, well, we need to get on the flight.  Oh, no, they've already closed the door.  Do you want to become part of the problem?  And then they made us stay in some ghetto hotel down in Atlanta. 
[01:35:00]  We had to spend the night because the guy, they just, the plane was right there.  And they said, well, once they've closed the door, they can't reopen it.  So you're just screwed for the night.  They had these weird things.  Like they had this, apparently the crew became illegal after a certain amount of hours,  which is what happened with this.  It's just.  Can't fly with a crew.  It was illegal.  It was something like that.  But they just, they didn't want to let them off the plane and deal with it.  Yeah, a lot of these things.  We got a guy bumped three times by Continental while trying to fly home to my. 
[01:35:30]  Bumped three times.  Right?  Yeah, okay.  Bumped three times while flying home to his mother's funeral.  How do they bump a guy flying to his mother's funeral?  Hey, Eric.  Hey, boys.  You told them you were flying home for your mom's funeral?  Yep.  My mom passed away on a Saturday.  We live in Colorado, but she was being buried in a family plot in Ohio.  And she scheduled on the plane.  We wanted, my wife, myself, and my dad wanted to be on the same plane as her casket. 
[01:36:00]  Continental says, oh, no problem.  The funeral home handled the arrangement, got us on there.  We showed up at the airport on time.  They said, oh, the flight's overbooked.  We'll get you on the flight that leaves an hour later.  We're like, well, okay, that's fine.  That flight comes due.  Oh, it's oversold also.  They said, okay, we have another flight that leaves in three hours. 
[01:36:30]  We're like, well, it's going to be an inconvenience.  But, okay.  We show up for that flight.  It's oversold.  We started demanding our money back.  A representative from American Airlines was walking by, heard what was going on,  made arrangements to get us on a flight out in about 30 minutes,  and American handled getting our luggage from Continental in Cleveland.  I'll tell you, Cleveland, this is what's despicable about that.  Cleveland's a hub for Continental.  That's a hub, meaning that they constantly have planes going in and out of there. 
[01:37:00]  Houston's their main one.  Then you have Newark and you have Cleveland.  So that's something they probably could have handled a lot better.  Well, I mean, I'll tell you what.  I mean, Continental, they just, it took us seven and a half weeks to get refunded our money.  And, I mean, we had to pay full fare, you know, on the spot, full fare on American,  but they were able to get us on the flight.  But it took us over seven weeks to get any type of a refund from Continental  because the comment from Continental was, well, if you would have waited another four hours, 
[01:37:30]  we could have got you on a flight.  And we're like, what part of it's a fucking funeral, and it's my mother, are you having a problem with?  They're not human.  It's like trying to talk to a computer screen.  The Terminator.  I've actually, I flew exclusively Continental,  and a couple of times I've had to switch up because HBO or somebody else,  and I got so tired of defending them to other networks.  Like, someone told me about this United flight that goes cross-country.  So I've flown United a couple of times, and you know what? 
[01:38:00]  They were great.  They were great.  It's like, oh, that's why they're the biggest airline in the world.  Maybe it's time to change airlines.  We're waiting for your move, Jimmy.  We're waiting for your move.  I feel comfortable on Continental.  I feel comfortable on American, and I feel comfortable on United as far as them being safe aircraft.  What about the JetBlue?  JetBlue, I do, too.  They've got some nice new planes.  They just don't want a first class.  And they get a little wacky with their announcements.  Nah, I don't want that crap.  They try to keep it a little fun for everybody.  I don't want fun, and I want a first class.  Yes, first class and no fun.  I don't want fun.  I want a Korean War vet captain whose wife even calls him sir in bed. 
[01:38:30]  I don't want fun.  I want official Frankie mustachioed man.  Yes.  I don't mind a little fun with my flight.  No fun with flying.  I think the last JetBlue flight I was on, they actually told us to roll up the windows because  they're about to take off.  Exactly.  I would have said, yes, open the door.  I'm getting off.  I don't want the windows down or up.  It got a few chuckles from everyone.  Of course it did.  To roll up the windows because they're about to take off.  While they said that, you know what should have been happening?  Let's recheck that knob instead. 
[01:39:00]  Yeah.  Instead of that joke, he could have been saying, check that for the 50th time.  Check something, like double, triple check something that could have been checked.  Speaking of flights, were you on the flight to Turks and Caicos where the guy took over  the plane and started buying drinks for everybody?  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  And they didn't know what to do?  Yeah.  That was our first trip there.  A lot of people have been on the party plane where you're going to Jamaica or some kind  of spring break flight and it's just a zoo in the air. 
[01:39:30]  Yeah.  They calmed all this down.  Somebody got in trouble.  Was it Hooters Airline or some?  There was an incident where they finally calmed this shit down.  Too much partying going on.  But the guy, he was in the front of the plane.  I don't think this had a first class section.  It was a shitty plane with some shitty airline just to get us to the islands.  And the guy just takes the talking device.  What do the fuck they call those things?  Microphones.  The PPA thing?  Yeah, it's not really a microphone, microphone.  Talking device.  The throat. 
[01:40:00]  He takes the throat from somebody.  The mouth.  And this guy just starts making announcements.  And the stewardess is like, I can't control this plane.  I can't.  And all of a sudden the guy goes, and just when she thought she could get control back  on the plane, the guy makes the announcement that all drinks are on him for the rest of  the flight.  So now the place goes nuts.  And what are you supposed to do as a stewardess but get to it and get everyone their drinks  on this guy? 
[01:40:30]  Oh, my God.  I've done that too, but I've always bought things that I knew the plane didn't have on  it.  Like I've grabbed the mic and I scream pot pies for everyone on me.  Let's say hi to Brian and P.A.  Brian.  Hey, how you doing?  Better now, Bri.  Good.  Yeah, I just got medically evacuated from Iraq.  I'm sitting in this little airport down in Virginia Beach.  And because I let an F word fly under my voice and there was a stewardess sitting right next 
[01:41:00]  to me, I got bumped off the plane.  Oh, yeah.  What airline?  It was Continental.  Well, what were you cursing about?  I was just cursing.  I just said I dropped something on the floor and I said, ah, fuck.  And I'm already late for my medical appointments, everything back in P.A. here.  And I just dropped it on the ground.  And I said, ah, fuck.  And they said, sir, you're going to have to leave the plane.  And I cursed next to the stewardess.  Are you leaving something out there, sir?  Maybe not.  They're uber sensitive these days.  I can't picture somebody just booting off a plane because you dropped something and 
[01:41:30]  you want to fuck.  Because we're the real terrorists.  So you've got to make sure everyone is calm and hoarse.  Under control.  Let me say hi to Lisa in Jersey.  Lisa.  You know what I really want were the silly little announcements they make just to try to keep  it fun for everyone.  I don't want those at all.  I despise them.  No, I want to hear some that were told on these flights.  Remember the pilot that was doing trivia contests for bottles of booze?  Which flight were we on for that one?  I think that was one of the Turks. 
[01:42:00]  I'm not sure.  It must have been a party plane.  The party planes rule.  Yeah.  And it was like the co-pilot who was giving trivia questions.  Yeah, doing trivia questions.  It's like, you know, check our course.  Make sure we're okay.  That's really comfortable sounding.  Let's say hi to Lisa in Jersey.  Lisa.  Hi.  How are you?  Hello.  Good.  I just want to let you know one time I had flown consciousness right after 9-11. 
[01:42:30]  And then I had a four-month-old daughter with me and our plane that was delayed because  of two flat tires on the plane.  So they pulled everybody off.  They gave us vouchers, go get some food.  Next thing I know, I go back, try to get back on the plane to go back home to New Jersey.  And they wouldn't let me through.  They actually boarded everybody on the plane.  I'm holding a newborn baby.  No purse, no diaper bag, no bottles, nothing.  And they said, sorry, you're on your own. 
[01:43:00]  I started crying.  I couldn't believe it.  Of course you did.  The incontinental woman just didn't want to hear it.  And thank God there was some elderly gentleman who was at the airport, part of security.  And he said, guys, she's got a newborn baby.  I had nothing with me but my baby.  Where was your purse?  I had left everything on the plane because they had us all get off.  You're silly.  How late were you getting back to the plane?  I was trying to get back to go into the plane and leave.  And then finally, security walked me on the plane after they delayed everything. 
[01:43:30]  They checked me out.  They called New Jersey to make sure who I was.  They got my purse.  And I said, oh, my God, I'm holding a newborn baby like I'm some kind of a terrorist.  But that was the worst experience I had ever had with Continental.  Exploding baby trick.  Yeah.  That was eight years ago, too.  We'll use it.  True.  No, and we understood that.  But it was just how they didn't want to hear it.  I'm holding a baby.  Right.  And they thought that I was going to do something.  Get the baby.  No, about the baby. 
[01:44:00]  All right, Lisa, thank you.  Hope the baby is healthy and wonderful now.  Kid's 41.  Right.  No, so I just Continental, their customer service is the worst.  Well, I mean, we're picking on Continental today, but I think in general, customer service  is just horrendous across the board.  I'm sure there's some examples out there.  American, United, every airline has, I'm sure, the same complaints from people.  Mike N. from Jersey.  I like when Continental makes someone not on elite status get off the elite carpet on the  floor.  Great perk.  I actually do like when I see someone trying to board and they push them aside. 
[01:44:30]  I do like that.  It's like we're only boarding elite status people right now.  So go back to the end of the fucking bilge, the bilge line.  I do like that.  Dan in Milwaukee, they'll keep you on the plane so they don't have to buy hotel rooms.  That's probably.  I'm sure that's one reason.  I'm sure that's part of it.  Save a little money.  I guess we're pretty much done with this topic, right?  We can move on to other things.  Sure.  After we take a food break. 
[01:45:00]  Someone has to tinkle.  Wow.  My hand's up.  Hold on.  Mike in Jersey has to share.  He's very frustrated.  Mike, go ahead.  Hey, my dad was flying from Tampa to Canada because his mother died to go to her funeral.  And he got stuck in Charlotte or Charleston.  I can't remember which one.  He was flying continental.  They oversold the flight and wouldn't book him on another flight.  He had a fax copy of the obituary and was told that he was no more important than any  other passenger on the plane.  Yeah, that's a power trip, too.  That's good.  That's good.  People on their power trips. 
[01:45:30]  How do they test for some?  How do they test some of these employees?  What do they like?  Have like stress tests?  And if they fail it miserably, they hire them?  Yeah, they give them a job.  How does that happen?  We got a guy that was stuck on a plane for 14 hours.  But then we got this guy.  I know we're trying to move on.  But listen to this one.  Dave, Tennessee.  Go ahead.  Hey, good morning, guys.  Good morning, Dave.  All of a sudden, one time I was taking a flight, my luggage comes off the carousel, and it's  drenched in jet fuel.  So I go over and talk to the guy at the luggage department, and this arrogant ass had the 
[01:46:00]  nerve to say, how do you know we did it?  It's not just a little jet fuel.  It's drenched in jet fuel.  Holy shit.  How did it work out for you?  They finally, I called.  I said, I want to talk to your supervisor.  And he came over and said, yeah, we ruined a bunch of stuff.  We got some mail, too.  They ended up just buy a piece of luggage, replace your clothes, send them a receipt. 
[01:46:30]  But I'm like, how did this, that was this guy's first reaction was, how do you know we  did it?  Well, I don't own a jet.  Exactly.  Yeah.  What would it be?  Why would you dip your luggage in jet fuel?  What would be the point of that?  It was on your plane.  Unless you'd been cheating on your wife, and you wanted to hide the perfume smell, and  you saw some jet fuel.  That's a good story right there.  Cody, 14 hours on a plane, huh? 
[01:47:00]  Food!  Yes.  Food!  Food!  Hello, Cody.  What's up, Cody?  Um, so yeah, I was like 15 years old.  I was on my way back from a flight from Germany.  Oh, yeah.  It's only about a seven-hour flight, but some asshole had a heart attack over London, so  he had to land.  And then I had to get him out.  That took time.  Then as we were getting ready to leave, they realized, oh yeah, the brakes have to cool, 
[01:47:30]  so we had to wait for that.  Then they realized, oh yeah, the food is all bad now.  So we had to wait for more fucking food.  Wait, the food's all bad?  What, what, how fresh a food do they need?  Yeah.  What were they, flambés that the fire went out and they had to get new ones?  Well, I guess it was all cold.  How sensitive is the food that it goes bad so fast?  Exactly.  What were they, quail eggs that fell?  Food's no good.  Sorry, sir.  Well, you know, they're panicky peeps with chicken and it getting cold and salmonella probably,  so.  You don't get salmonella in 10 minutes.  No. 
[01:48:00]  Well, but, you know, they're irrational.  So, on top of that, I was 15 by myself and they said, oh, we overbooked the flight.  Can you stay another night?  And I just said, I'm 15, you fucking dumbassers.  I can't stay here by myself in Europe.  So, that's how that went.  Put a mouth on you.  Yeah.  Apparently, a certain language just flies out of your young mouth.  I enjoyed the call, though, with the food going bad after 14 hours.  The jet fuel guys killing me.  Yes, Cody, go ahead.  That was it?  Okay.  Can I defend myself? 
[01:48:30]  I said the talking device and people are kind of picking up on that because it's not an  actual microphone.  What is that?  What is it really called?  PA.  I mean, public address system.  Yeah, like PA or.  Well, with that said, John C. from Chile.  He's writing from South America, everyone.  Oh.  This show is worldwide.  I'll say.  Oh, did you mean jet fuel or make the airplane go liquid?  Fucking asshole.  That's smart ass.  That's good.  Make the airplane go liquid. 
[01:49:00]  I'm going to take a beating the rest of the day.  Got bumped from first class to coach in between two 250-pound guys.  Yeah, that shit happens.  Got a blowjob from a stewardess.  Hello.  Got bumped up to first class my first time flying.  Oh, boy.  That's not how you want to start your flying career.  That's not the blowjob from the stewardess guy.  What a great day he had.  I'd be very jealous.  This will be the last one in this set, and then we'll take a break.  We have to take a no-talky time. 
[01:49:30]  Yes.  No-talky time.  Jamie in Alabama.  Hey.  Opie.  Yeah.  Man, we were flying to Costa Rica one time, and it was awesome.  This chick got me in the back, gave me a good blowjob.  She was a stewardess.  That's what this is.  See, I could have done that.  That sounds like five different stories.  That is the worst story I've ever heard. 
[01:50:00]  Dude, I gave all the basics.  You're supposed to fill in with details now.  It's a blowjob story from a stewardess, and it was awesome.  She was a stewardess.  We have no doubt that it was awesome.  We were just trying to find out more and how you get that done.  She put my penis in her mouth.  And he's too busy listening to the radio. 
[01:50:30]  All right.  We got to listen.  He's the worst person I've ever had called this show.  Yes.  I can't tell you how depressing it is where we sit when we see what could be radio gold.  Yeah.  These phone calls don't come in on a regular basis.  You know you got a nugget.  That guy.  And then it's so, there's such a letdown.  He was listening to the radio, so he was talking real slow trying to answer what was going on on the radio. 
[01:51:00]  And then his story stunk anyway.  His pacing was enraging.  Wow.  We were on a flight.  That guy made me laugh so hard.  Yeah, he really was.  I love the guy.  He was terrible.  He was a terrible man.  I almost want to hear that back.  Travis has it if you wanted.  Yeah.  We got to hear it.  Yeah.  With the setup, by the way, is key.  Yeah.  I gave the basics to the phone call.  This is the worst caller we've ever had. 
[01:51:30]  I don't know about that.  That's up for debate, my friend.  I am saying this is the worst caller.  Just his content and then him listening to himself.  Yeah, listening to himself.  I got to hear this again.  Going back.  Got bumped up to first class my first time flying.  Oh, boy.  That's not how you want to start your flying career.  How about set the blowjob from the stewardess guy?  What a great day he had.  I'd be very jealous.  This will be the last one in this set, and then we'll take a break.  We have to take a no-talky time. 
[01:52:00]  Yes.  No-talky time.  Jamie in Alabama.  Hi.  Hey.  Opie.  Yeah.  Man, we were flying to Costa Rica one time, and it was awesome.  This chick got me in the back, gave me a good blowjob.  She was a stewardess.  That's what this is.  See, I could have done that.  That sounds like five different stories. 
[01:52:30]  We're back live.  And she was a stewardess.  Horrid storytelling.  That was an...  How does a blowjob from a stewardess on a plane story make everybody sick to their stomach?  It was awful.  Thomas Overbeck from Dallas.  I thought Chris Farley was dead.  Yeah, it was awesome.  That guy was terrible.  Matt in Boston is saying, this BJ on plane call is the best.  Play this every day.  I'm laughing so hard at work right now. 
[01:53:00]  That is just the worst call.  Opie.  30 seconds.  I was on a plane to Costa Rica.  It was awesome.  It was a stewardess.  This chick took me back in the plane and gave me a blowjob.  She was a stewardess.  I heard you were one of them girls were stewardess.  I believe one of them girls was from Arkansas.  A boo.  A boo is right. 
[01:53:30]  Holy shit.  That's fantastic.  Somebody wants to defend customer service.  Do we really want to go down the thread?  Yes.  We should give a fair shake.  All right.  That's fair enough.  Hugh in Louisiana.  I figured we were talking to a few customer service people today.  Go ahead, Hugh.  Good evening.  Good evening.  Happy birthday, Jimmy.  Thanks a lot, sir.  People have been forgetting today.  I feel really, really forgotten.  Birthday.  Yeah.  Well, you know, I'm in customer service, so I'll never forget.  Okay.  Hello. 
[01:54:00]  Thank you.  Big boo.  Hey, well, I work in customer service, and I can admit that I get a bit desensitized by  having to deal with customers all the time, mostly ninjas that are constantly just begging  for free stuff with the littlest mistake.  And I guess a little bit, you just get desensitized by dealing with the public.  Yeah, I'm sure.  And how demanding and how rude sometimes they get. 
[01:54:30]  And every once in a while, you do run across a nice person that genuinely has a legitimate  complaint.  And as customer service people, you do have to recognize when somebody does have a legitimate  complaint, take care of it.  And she was a stewardess.  Yeah, I didn't even hear what...  I can't get through that.  Is this a good phone call?  Because I'm just...  I know.  I can't get through that.  Yeah, sorry, we're distracted by that guy.  I hit an iceberg with the last guy, and my ship is sinking.  Wouldn't you love to be on a flight and just start complaining that you wanted to sit next 
[01:55:00]  to a not-ugly person?  How angry and embarrassed would they be if you had to be asked to leave the plane because  they were too homely and you couldn't enjoy your flight?  Me good.  Neil in Seattle wants to finish the blowjob story.  Neil.  Cool.  Neil's a stewardess.  Hey, good day, fellas.  How y'all doing?  Better now, Neil.  Godspeed.  I'm on my way to Germany.  I'm going to finish this guy's story.  I'm sitting in the back of the plane.  I see this voluptuous, beautiful stewardess come up. 
[01:55:30]  Our eyes met.  Next thing I know, she's ripping my pants off, blowing me in the back of the plane.  Is that true?  No.  No.  And he's trying to tell it like Penthouse Forum.  Yeah, he was trying to pump up that guy's story a little bit.  Punching it up a little.  Sure.  That was very sexy.  That couldn't have been sexier if you said, so she walked into the bathroom while I was  dropping a deuce and tickled my bag.  Fuck it.  No.  That was horrendous.  Oh.  And then she slammed the drink cart into my fucking helmet.  She closed my dick in the drink cart door. 
[01:56:00]  Steven S. from Bayshore, he's got a request.  What?  Yes.  He wants every call today to end with, she was a stewardess.  She was a stewardess.  We could do that today.  Jeff Johnson from Tokyo.  Shows worldwide.  Yes, it is.  If the flying public only knew what us pilots did while flying, read newspapers, watch DVDs,  sleep, and now that we have internet on the airplanes, porn.  That's good.  So you want to see your co-pilot jacking? 
[01:56:30]  Yeah.  We got a nice customer service phone call going into break, a classic.  Sure do.  Yes.  We haven't heard this one in a while, so let's take a listen to this.  Can I give a tease?  Yeah, Jimmy.  What's your tease?  When we come back, I'll be plugging something.  Oh, jeez.  I'm plugging something when we get back.  Yes.  Not now.  Is it good?  It's just a Long Island gig.  I'm finally coming back to Long Island after.  Oh.  Oh, someone's excited.  It's my neck of the woods.  You can't come.  Oh.  Oh, the FH Riley's gig?  I'm not doing an FH Riley's.  In the heart of Huntington Village, 400 New York Avenue. 
[01:57:00]  I knew we'd get you that story.  I'll be asking.  How far are you from?  It's in Bayshore, New York.  Oh, well.  That's the South.  Is that far from you?  I don't know.  It's the South Shore.  That's the opposite end of the...  Oh, the opposite side of the island.  How long is it that big?  Of Long.  Somebody famous lives there that goes to that FH a lot.  Oh, right, right.  I forgot his name.  Bayshore.  Bayshore.  Bayshore.  Bayshore.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Steve.  Oh.  From Bayshore.  You know the guy.  Steven S. Rome. 
[01:57:30]  Bayshore.  Tickets go on sale this Friday.  It's for October 2nd.  What club?  The YMCA Bolton Center for the Performing Arts.  Holy shit.  It's supposed to be a very small little theater.  It's supposed to be gorgeous.  I think I've been to that theater.  Gorgeous.  How old am I?  I know.  The actor.  But this Friday goes on sale.  Nice.  I don't know what time.  But...  You were scaring me when you just said YMCA Street.  Let me tell you what that used to be.  I know what it was, too.  Yep.  All right, good.  I'm sorry.  That used to be the fucking porno theater.  That's right. 
[01:58:00]  Yes.  I heard it has stadium seating, which I've done a couple gigs with stadium seating.  It's sticky seating when I was in there.  It was...  Yeah, that was the porno theater.  Is it really?  Yeah, it used to be.  What is it?  Oh, it's YMCA Center for the Performing Arts.  I guess they took it over.  Oh, yeah.  A long time ago.  When I was in high school, we'd get a bunch of us, and we'd go down to the porn theater  because that was the only way you could see your porn.  How great is that?  That was where you went.  That's absolutely an old porn theater.  I should leave a pack of chewing gum.  I should leave a piece of chewing gum on the floor for every person because that's  the last thing you want on the floor of a porn theater is fucking gum.  That was where I saw my first fucking porn movie. 
[01:58:30]  Great.  Because we didn't have the internet?  No.  Really?  Absolutely.  No videos?  No videos?  Absolutely.  I'm actually...  I wasn't fortunate enough to have 8mm films like Ant found one day.  Yeah, that was nice.  Yeah, I went to that theater and saw my first porn flick.  Absolutely.  It is stadium seating, too.  Pete told me that.  Dude, man.  So that's probably where they would sit and watch it.  I'm sure they don't want everyone to know that it used to be a porn theater.  I'm sure they're trying to move on from that.  Well, that was a long time ago.  If you're a bit older, you do remember that as a porn theater. 
[01:59:00]  Yay!  Danny, is you going to pick that online?  I would love to see what that's...  YMCA...  Yay!  What is Bullton?  B-O-U-L-T-O-N.  What is that?  I don't know.  I don't know.  I could have a couple of jokes, but that would be horrible.  What are Bulltons?  It's ripe for comedy.  Bullton.  Bullton.  Let's take a break.  I'm waiting for one of these alleged jokes to show up.  No, no, no, no, no.  They're just horrible.  Okay.  All right.  Well, tickets go out to sale Friday for...  I'm finally coming back to October 2nd.  I have not been to Long Island since almost two years. 
[01:59:30]  Can't wait.  Wow.  That's not good, Jimmy.  Not good at all.  I love Long Island.  I really do.  They're like some of the best fans.  They will fucking clamor to see you.  I don't know.  Yes, they will.  It's break-y time.  Yes, it's no talk-y for a bit time.  Yeah.  That little 12-ounce goddamn roll of sausage is supposed to feed your brother and me and  you, 600 pounds of men at least, you get my point, and the two girls, and they put  it in that pussy roll of sausage.

I don't know where you people come from.  I don't know if you test your products, your quantity of your product.  Your products are very delicious.  Love your sausage for 30-something years, but I can't take and feed a family of five on  a little 12-ounce roll of sausage.  I don't mind paying you more money for your 16-ounce roll of sausage, but you don't have 
[02:00:30]  it anymore.  You've got a 12-ounce roll, and you've got three men that weigh over 200 pounds apiece,  a woman that's a little plump Scotch girl, and a daughter who's 13, and you're going  to try to take a 12-ounce roll of sausage and a couple of dozen eggs and feed that, it  ain't going to work, and I'm not going to purchase your product anymore or ever again.  And as far as your 16-ounce and maple and sage, I don't eat that.  I'm not from the north. 
[02:01:00]  I'm a Texas man.  Jimmy Dean sausage is for southern people to eat with the breakfast with the fried eggs  and the T-bone steaks.  And I can't see going to a little 12-ounce package to feed four, five, six people.  And I'm not going to buy two of those 12-ounce packages just because you want to downsize  and charge the same goddamn price.  I'd sure like a reply, and I'd sure like you to go back to your 16-ounce package on your 
[02:01:30]  regular sausage because I'm not going to buy it.  Otherwise, ever again, I'll just have my own damn sausage made like I used to 30-something  years ago.  It's not as tasty as yours is, but it'll work.  Goodbye.  Right after today's Ron and Fez show, check out the O&H show replay.

And they are actively seeking another 23 listeners of this station to match to this same work-from-home opportunity.

A leaking charge air cooler not only means increased fuel consumption, which costs you more for fuel.  It also means a loss of engine power and lost revenue due to downtime. 
[02:09:00]  That means wasted fuel economy and loss of engine power.  Your truck's cooler provides it with a breath of cool, dense air.  And in order to do this, it needs to be free of leaks and cracks.  Have your cooler tested today.  And if it's leaking, have it replaced with a Duralite, who manufactures the best charge air cooler in the world.  Imagine saving up to an estimated $400 or more a month just on fuel savings alone with a Duralite.

[02:12:30]  Carolina Man writes, since when is your ad copy being written by Bobo?  Get your fuck on.  Ah, yes.  A lot of people loving the live read for Penthouse TV.  Yeah, it was brand new.  Really?  I couldn't tell.  And I hadn't pre-read it.  So it was pretty funny to me, too, to come stumbling across some of those words.  But, hey, whatever.  That's what they want.  That's good.  Kenny almost tripped on the way into the studio, because he couldn't wait to tell us something. 
[02:13:00]  And I told him he had to say it on the air.  Yes, Kenny.  During the commercial break, did you see the chef that went into Martha Stewart?  Martha Stewart's studio right around the corner.  Yeah, right next door.  Yeah.  The fucking idiot showed up with his hat on and everything.  He's got, like, that white chef coat and apron and that fucking big hat.  That stupid marshmallow hat.  Yeah.  Well, he's on radio.  What's he dressing up for?  How can you concentrate on what you're making with that ridiculous floppy hat on your head? 
[02:13:30]  Is it the floppy mushroom hat, or is it the straight, like, cylinder one?  No, it's the straight stovepipe with the mushroom on top.  Oh, God, that's stupid.  Yeah, he must be the executive sous chef.  I'll let you know.  All right, Jimmy.  Jimmy, point and laugh at the guy if he's wearing the hat.  He's a saucier.  Saucier.  Nice.  We should get Sam to do a little backstage with the chef hat guy.  With the fucking hat. 
[02:14:00]  But Kenny does make a good point.  Why would you show up with the hat?  Yeah.  Everything else makes sense.  It's radio.  That's a bignana.  It's radio.  We're waiting for Jimmy to come back with a report.  This is radio.  Jimmy just wanted to check out the chicks because the Martha Stewart chicks are hot.  Oh, is that what he's doing?  Yeah.  Yeah, forget that.  Are they really?  I'm Sam, but I did on the way out.  I heard you say I'm a saucier.  I'm a saucier. 
[02:14:30]  Are you?  Here's your head.  I'm going to throw your head into a sauce pot, you dummy.  Just wanted to be a cook.  Yeah, fucking guy just wants to be a cook.  I just saw a bunch of people and I couldn't see any hat though, unfortunately.  Are the Martha Stewart chicks really hot?  The one girl is very pretty, but the ones I've met have been nice too.  They don't have any.  They seem fine.  Yeah. 
[02:15:00]  I don't know what her name is, but she's really pretty.  They got a pretty good show in the afternoon.  Did they?  Alexis and...  Do they?  I've not listened.  Alexis and...  I know the one gal on the morning show is a looker.  Very bitchy.  Very bitchy, edgy, don't take no shit type of gal.  Oh, sassy.  No, it's a good show though.  I can't trash them.  I don't know what the morning show is like.  It's a good show for broads.  Because I'm here.  If you're a broad.  Yeah, if you're a dame.  It's Alexis and...  Kenny knows everything around here. 
[02:15:30]  I don't know why, but he knows everything.  Because he's a busy body.  You think?  He walks around here and he's a busy body.  When you walk around with Kenny, like when he walks us out or whatnot, right?  Do you notice how many people he says hi to in a way where he's had in-depth conversations  with them?  Oh, yeah, yeah.  It's really creepy.  I'm a people person.  Are you?  I'm very sociable.  I'm a social butterfly.  What's the afternoon show over there?  It's Alexis and who?  This song's a butter face. 
[02:16:00]  Yeah, Alexis.  I hear she's got a crude mouth.  Oh, really?  Yeah, yeah.  Martha Stewart's daughter.  Yeah?  Does he have the afternoon show?  Yeah.  Got a dirty little mouth on her?  That's what I hear.  Oh.  And who's their partner?  Alexis and what?  I don't know.  I'm trying to give them a plug.  They're all right.  I only know what I know.  Especially broad.  I only know what I know.  Yeah.  That's not much, Kenny.  But he has a busy body, Kenny.  Yeah.  Why isn't he the worst?  Yeah, he wanders around.  He knows all the gossip that's going on. 
[02:16:30]  It's intelligence information.  Yeah, yeah.  Just walk in the halls.  How do they not see you?  I just want to act like a pterodactyl on the wall.  Is there anyone taller than you here?  It's awful.  Yeah, I think one of the sports guys that does the statistics, he's in one of them offices.  He's pretty giant.  Yeah.  That's Bizarro Ryan Stiles.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  There's a lot of Bizarro people that work here.  There's Bizarro Penn Jillette who works here. 
[02:17:00]  Oh, I've seen him.  And there's also Bizarro Ryan Stiles.  If you don't know who Ryan Stiles is, he's the guy from one of the Whose Line Is It Anyway  guys.  I'll pull up a picture.  You'll immediately know who I'm talking about.  By the way, Kenny, can you inform whoever brought this banana, if they ever bring me  a banana this far from being ripe again, I'm going to stab the throat.  I told him.  That thing won't even peel.  No.  I hate a banana that won't peel.  It's still got fucking root dirt on it.  It's like a plantain.  Oh, they hang from the tree.  Yeah.  They grew out of the ground.  I'm a dope. 
[02:17:30]  Like a banana's grown out of the ground.  You idiots.  What the fuck?  I wish they did.  I'd be sitting in my garden.  Hell of a way to harvest a crop.  A banana garden.  Get the fuck out of here.  They do me planting banana seeds.  They never grow?  No.  There's no way you thought that.  I was just thinking.  That was a brain fart.  There's no way you thought that.  Oh, you know, I know they hang from trees in bushels.  They come in bushels. 
[02:18:00]  Bunches.  Oh, bunches.  Bushels.  What?  What's wrong?  You can tell me.  I haven't picked bananas before.  Ty's eat them.  You're hysterical.  You can tell that we need a vacation.  We get bushels.  I'm saying talking device.  You think bananas grow out of the ground.  A bushel of bananas grow out of the ground.  Wrong.  A bunch.  Wrong.  Holy shit.  All right.  Well, it's got root dirt. 
[02:18:30]  That was my best joke.  Root dirt.  It's still got root dirt on it.  Dirt.  What a fucking fool.  Yeah.  Wow.  Were you ever wrong?  I'm afraid if I bite this, I'm going to chip my tooth.  I know.  I want a fucking ripe banana.  That answer is false.  You get nothing.  You lose.  Good day, sir.  Is it good? 
[02:19:00]  Sometimes unripe bananas are a little better.  Not in this occasion.  No fucking way.  They're never better.  No, no.  No.  Sometimes a little unripe is good.  I agree with Gregorio.  As opposed to overripe, which is really horrid.  My grandmother.  Mushy.  Mushad.  My grandmother would leave bananas out because she liked when they got brown.  I swear.  I know.  I know.  I know.  I swear to God.  She would leave them out until they got brown.  Really?  Oh, she liked her banana's brown.  I swear to God. 
[02:19:30]  She liked the brown banana.  Oh.  Because they were soft for her teeth.  Oh, for Nana's teeth.  Yeah.  Really yucky.  At that point, you could only make banana bread.  It's Alexis and Jennifer, and a few of the listeners definitely are saying they didn't want  to like Alexis and Jennifer because they did some time on Rana Fez, but they were really  funny in there.  It's an all right show.  Absolutely.  I was very surprised.  I actually, that whole marketing bit I do as a joke, but I did tell the dopes here at  SiriusXM that Alexis and Jennifer are definitely on the wrong channel because when you tune 
[02:20:00]  in Martha Stewart, you're expecting like recipes and like centerpiece advice for your social  party, and then you got these two girls on in the afternoon, and they're getting some  shit done.  Yeah.  They make fun of Elizabeth Hasselbeck.  They do all that shit.  They're not making decoupage.  No, but that's what you think if you tune in Martha Stewart.  Right?  Absolutely.  It's all about marketing and branding.  If you got a hip show, you don't put them on Martha Stewart.  That's a show for recipes and whatnot. 
[02:20:30]  Yeah.  Hey, what should I do with these macaronis?  Right.  Well, you can glue them to a plate and spray paint them gold.  Ooh.  Give them to mommy.  That's what I did.  Me too.  I made a little macaroni thing on a paper plate.  And that spray paint gave you a fucking lung cancer problem.  Oh, it's good.  Mesothelioma.  Yeah.  Oh my God.  Let me try to say that.  Say it again.  Mesothelioma.  I got the miso part.  Say it again.  Miso soup.  Mesothelioma?  Say it again.  Mesothelioma. 
[02:21:00]  Mesothelioma.  There you go.  Oh, mesothelioma.  Yes.  You gotta give me a word every day.  Mesothelioma.  Mesothelioma.  It's a little horny.  Get it?  Yeah.  I get it.  The joke is always better when you say get it.  No, I'm a big fan of the Jim Norton get it bit.  Give me a big word every day.  I want to start talking right now.  Oh, wow.  Say that one again.  Did you get it?  What?  What he just said.  Oh, now I have to remember it?  Yes. 
[02:21:30]  Mesothelioma.  What was it again?  I can't say this word.  I'm not even fucking playing.  I figured after being on the radio since I was 18 years old, I should start talking right.  Speaking correctly?  Talking right.  Mesothelioma.  Huh?  Yes.  Yes, that's it.  That one amazes me when you can just pop that one out of your head.  Chicks from the show, Ron.  Ron Efez, they said, if you cheat, just don't tell your spouse. 
[02:22:00]  The chef is wearing the hat to cover up the hair plugs.  He just has follicles.  Well, this is a very good observation as far as Kenny goes.  Ron in New York.  Kenny.  Yeah, Kenny's so cool.  I met you and him leading up against a car in front of Caroline's last year.  He was so cool that when I looked at the buildings that he was standing in front of, much like them,  he started out normal height, and as he got higher and higher and higher, his head looked 
[02:22:30]  like it disappeared, like it was a pinhead, like the buildings.  It advanced into the clouds.  It is.  He does just have a little tiny head.  Yes.  I thought it was an optical illusion.  We got it.  Sorry.  Just kidding.  You know, in one of the videos I made, they actually were debating if Kenny is slightly  retarded.  Really?  Slightly or completely?  Wait a minute.  What's slightly?  No, not even as the joke we do for the show.  They were really, like, studying his eyes, his face. 
[02:23:00]  Oh, wow.  How the head comes up to a slight, like, point.  Doberman Pinscher type of fucking scud.  I was like, these guys are ruthless, man.  But he was a police officer.  Yes, of course.  I'm a cop, you idiot.  Probably the smartest guy in the room.  Yes, eh?  It's very, um...  What?  What?  You know what Kenny can do?  He can, uh...  Crack some skulls?  De-deuce.  He really can.  He can, uh...  Because he's a de-doosh. 
[02:23:30]  Get it?  Da-ha, da-ha  Da-ha, da-ha  Holy shit  I'm absolutely crying over here  Oh my god  This is going to be a rough rest of the week, man 
[02:24:00]  This is just  You might want to tune in  We started silly time three days early  It's the last few days of class  Stewardess blowjob guy totally ruined the rest of the week  I know, he really did  Yeah, and that fucking guy didn't end his phone call  With the steward line  Stewardess line  Big difference  Got a blowjob from a steward  I was on a flight 
[02:24:30]  Yes, I have a story  It was awesome  Awesome  I have to get back now and tend to my banana garden  Get it?  Banana garden  Holy shit, Jimmy  That is so good  Yeah  Kyle S. from Indiana writes that my big word today is PA 
[02:25:00]  So I'm going to start there  Kenny isn't too sociable  He fell asleep while I was talking to him once  Get the fuck out of here  Anthony, Jersey Shore  Hey, what's going on  Hey, man  Happy birthday, Jimmy  Hey, yeah  I was at one of the last shows  Where they had the audience in there  And I was talking to Kenny  He fell asleep on the chair with us  And I got a picture of it  I'd like to share it with you fellas  Okay 
[02:25:30]  Alright  Give it to a girl with big tits  And have her bring it up  I'm going to send it in to you fellas, alright  Alright  Thank you, Anthony  And somebody needs Jimmy's help  We got James in Virginia  James  Hey, how dope are you, Jimmy?  That's not a good way to ask for my help, James  Oh, shit  That's no way to ask for my help  By the way, that caller didn't end his call with the stewardess line  What's that?  Can I help you dig for some apples today, Jimmy? 
[02:26:00]  What was that?  Hold on  Your phone cuts out  And I was talking over  You want to what?  Can we dig for some apples?  Hey, we heard it  Exactly  Apple digger shop  Fucking stupid apple joke  Alright, listen  I hope we dig through a pile of shit for some apples  And we find you holding one  Get it?  Because there's duty on him  The man has duty on him 
[02:26:30]  Before we get to the story where a woman duped by a middle-aged man who acted like a child  Really?  This is the story of the day  You didn't hear about this one yet?  Yeah  Wait till you hear this  We're going to go backstage  Because I think the silliness started when we went after E-Rock very early in the show  Sam shoved the mic in his face right after he was humiliated on the air  Oh, he did?  And did a little backstage  And this one's titled 
[02:27:00]  E-Rock is Krabby  And now, backstage with ONA  Here is Primetime Sam Roberts  I'm Primetime Sam Roberts  And after another dazzling performance on the Opie and Anthony show  E-Rock the Sex Bagel exited the studio cursing at this reporter  I found E-Rock to get things resolved between us  E-Rock  What, Sam?  Why did you cuss at me?  You said F me  What's wrong here, E-Rock? 
[02:27:30]  Talk to me  Don't egg me on knowing damn well that I heard why they wanted me in the studio  And you're like, but there's a phone call  Like, I don't know why they want you in there  Why'd they want you in there?  Because they want me in there to take a phone call from somebody insulting me  What'd they say?  You know what they said  I wasn't listening  That's why I said fuck you, Sam  I was doing some editing  What did the listener say?  You'll have to pull the audio and see what the listener said  Well, okay  In the interest of fair journalism, we present to you the clip in question 
[02:28:00]  We brought E-Rock all the way back from way down the hall  He's in the office, really busy, working on something very important for the show  That you guys will never know that he was responsible for  Yes  So John, what do you got?  Hey, E-Rock  Yeah, go ahead  I just wanted to let you know you're a fat pig  Thanks, asshole  Okay, E-Rock, I pulled the audio  He called you a fat pig  That he did  What's your response?  He's an asshole  Why?  I mean, he's just a listener  Yeah, a fat listener  How do you know?  He was on the phone  Because all our listeners are fat 
[02:28:30]  Why are you so bitter against our listeners?  Oh, I wonder why  They pay our checks, E-Rock  They're the subscribers  They're very important  Good for them  E-Rock  Why?  What's got you in such a bad mood today?  You  Why me?  I didn't even do anything  Come on  There's a phone call for you  I don't know what it is  You should go in the studio, really  They want you to  Opie and Anthony asked for you  That has nothing to do with me  You knew damn well what it was  I was standing right there  And I heard what it was  And you're trying to play it off  Like you have no idea  I have to listen more carefully  I fucking hate you, Sam 
[02:29:00]  Why?  Apparently, Sex Bagel has some kind of unresolved anger issues  Because we have no idea where all this animosity is coming from  We will, however, stay on the case  I'm Prime Time Sam Roberts  And this has been  Backstage with ONA  Holy shit  That was pretty good  Sam is brutal  What a dick  He is a douchebag  Very nice  Alright 
[02:29:30]  You want to hear about this woman?  Yes, I do  You don't remember what I said to you  No, no, I do  It was a guy  She got duped  Duped  Yeah  A guy pretending to be a kid  No  No  No?  No?  He was pretending to be disabled  No  Is this the diapers? 
[02:30:00]  Maybe  I got to hear this now  Janet Schulte  Believed the man who he told her by phone  That his 40-something disabled brother  Needed a caregiver  Who could bottle feed him  Do you want to read this?  Please  Janet believed the man  Alright, that should be a comma  I do believe  Janet believed the man  When he told her by phone  That his 40-something disabled brother 
[02:30:30]  Needed a caregiver  Who could bottle feed him  And change his diapers  Alright  Alright  This broad is stupid  So far that sounds reasonable  What the Melbourne  Or Melbourne  Melbourne  Melbourne  Whatever  What we can't believe  Is that he committed no crime  Now that she said she found out  The situation was a charron  At the three months  That the man and his brother  Were the same person  Oh wow  That's cool 
[02:31:00]  Guy calls up  My brother needs help  Could he come over  Be the caregiver  Change his diapers  And bottle feed him  And then that guy becomes the  Then he gets into the  Diaper  Diaper  Yeah  He's so into infantilism  This guy  Oh that is fantastic  She's pissed off  And he's smart  She's pissed off  That he didn't have  The disabilities  He claimed to have  I feel violated  She changed his dieters  His dieters  His diety  What an asshole  What a fucking  There's a lot of assholes  In this story 
[02:31:30]  So he had to shit himself  What a  And she would change  The diaper  Yes  He'd get wet  Oh my god  Is that him  Please can I see him  Alright let me  Let me continue  Is he an adult  His baby  Whatever the fuck  They're called  It has to be  Yeah  I feel violated  Because she said  The man has deceived  Other women  And will try again  I feel disgusted  Investigators and prosecutors  Have refused to pursue charges  Wow  She agreed to provide the care  I consented to  I consented to change his diapers 
[02:32:00]  But I legitimately thought  This man needed help  She said  How could that not be a crime  For him to come into my house  And expose himself  Holy shit  He paid her  Not enough evidence  Arrested her for being a hooker  Yeah he obviously does have  Some kind of a disability  Mentally  Yeah  He thinks it's hot  To put on diapers  And drive  If you have to drive  Yourself somewhere  In diapers  You have problems  You're a fool  They're admitting  It's a weird case  The sheriff  Admits that  It's really on a borderline  Of possibly being a fraud 
[02:32:30]  He is perpetuate  Perpetuate  Per  What  You can say it  Misothelioma  Something there  Because he's doing it  Under a false pretense  The deception began  Janet said  When she placed an ad  Online on craigslist.org  Offering child care services  She said a man called  And asked  We should do this  Oh man  A man called  And asked Janet 
[02:33:00]  If she knew  Any special needs  Caregivers  The man told  Janet that a car accident  Left his brother  With physical disabilities  Including weak arms  Poor bladder control  And the mental capacity  Of a five year old  Bladder  He told her how  An aunt and current  Caregiver had no patients  He offered Janet  $600 a week  To look after his brother  Which is him  That's a lot of money  Right?  Yeah  That's over 30 G's a year  To change the diaper  Of a  And I'm sure  That's cash business  Right there  That 30 G's  Is almost 60  And he must have 
[02:33:30]  Had to just sit there  Going  Oh yeah  Duh  Duh  With a big rod  You think he got a rod?  How could he not?  I do thinking about it  Smelled like Tinkle  Because it was in a dieter  Changes nappies  What's wrong with this guy?  She's gone on a date already  He's smart  I took care of him  Just like I would my kids  She said  I rubbed his head  When he was falling asleep  I waited on him  Hand and foot  You want more?  In three months  Janet provided care 
[02:34:00]  She said the man  Never slipped out of character  Wow  The guy played such a good role  Whether pretending to be  The brother  Or the man who hired her  So the guy was going  Back and forth  Being the brother  And the disabled person  Janice said the man  Who hired her  Always had an explanation  For any red flag  She tried to meet him  In person  But their plans  Always fell through  But that seemed normal  Given their competing schedules  Then Janet said  Her husband noticed  Subtle changes  In the brother's behavior  And payment to his wife  Was erratic  Janet said  Randall followed him  One day  When he left their home 
[02:34:30]  Instead of walking  To his aunt's house  He got into a parked car  Two blocks away  And drove off  Her husband followed the man  To his home  And confronted him  She said  And that's when  The deputies  Became involved  How embarrassing  He figured out the prestige  Exactly what it is  The man admitted to  The deception  And blamed  Post-traumatic stress disorder  Without further explanation  What do they have  A diaper blow-up plan  What war was he in  Diaper blow  He saw his friends  Get shot in a crib  Oh come on 
[02:35:00]  This was never  Sexual in nature  No  It's all sexual in nature  I think  Yeah yeah  It's gotta be  That's what Janet said  She said it was never  Sexual in nature  Some suggested  That it might be  An adult baby  Or diaper lover fetish  How the fuck  Do you get into that  I don't know  What the fuck  I barely understand  The foot fetish  Now I'm supposed to understand  The diaper lover fetish  I don't get foot fetish  Although I will suck feet  But it's not a fetish  Yeah  Often people with such fetishes  Want to be treated as babies 
[02:35:30]  And talk in barely audible voices  As the man did  And there you have it  Wow  Let's file this  Hey  Smart man  Figured it out  He got a plan  He executed it  It worked  Yeah  How you gonna  How you gonna  Blame him  Fantastic  Alright  I'm gonna eat my bagel  We'll take a quick break  Alrighty  We did the Secretary of State  Hillary Clinton thing  God  She sound like a bitch  In that one  Yeah  Sam interviewed  Juliette Lewis 
[02:36:00]  Yesterday  Yeah  I heard she was very nice  Fuck man  I watched her YouTube channel  And she's crazy  Yeah  And she's doing the music thing  That bitch is crazy  And her music isn't that bad  Really  And she's really taking it  Very seriously  She's pretty much  Traveling the world  With the music  And we really wanted her  On the show  She would have been  Perfect for the show  So why isn't she  On our show  Probably the publicist  I'm guessing publicist  I'm not sure  If the time worked out  Either  I think Sam  She came in at 10.30  She did  Fuck  She came in the building  At 10.30  That's frustrating man  We could have had her  I waited  I was gonna get a photo 
[02:36:30]  With her  But they didn't want to ask  So I would have to wait  Till 11.45  So just stand around  For an hour  Because I'm a fucking nobody  So I would have to wait  An hour and 15 minutes  Why would you have to wait  I don't know  People didn't want to ask  Her reps  Jim Norton  Are you serious  Yeah dead serious  Fucking people  You know celebrities  People  No it wasn't their people  It was people there  Or assholes  It wasn't their people  Wait wait what  Who wouldn't want to  Who didn't want to  I don't know  Just somebody  Because she  Juliet Lewis was running late  And she was doing an interview  Now of course 
[02:37:00]  I wouldn't want her  She's doing an interview  That's fine  Right  But in between  Like her going  From one to the other  I wanted to try to get  A shot with her  You know  Five seconds  Hi how are  Oh nice to meet you  Take care  That really is all it is  And I would have to wait  Till 11.45  When Sam was interviewing her  Jesus  I'm not  Believe me  I'm not  A celebrity  But I've been doing comedy  I've taken enough photos  With fans  Hold on man  I know how long it takes  Stop with that shit  You are  Definitely a celebrity  I'm well known 
[02:37:30]  But not  Like that  You're  You're closer than  You're closer than you think  Mr. Jay Leno  She's a movie  But you know what I'm saying  I'm realistic about where I am  I don't expect  You're a lot closer  Than you realize  But it's like  After a while  It's like  Wait an hour  I can see  Hey could you wait  Till this interview is done  Yeah of course  Right  But could you wait  An hour and 15 minutes  It's like  Jesus Christ man  Like  Alright  It's  It's  Whatever  Let's just  Red flag everybody  I'm not even  Screaming and yelling 
[02:38:00]  I'm just  I was disappointed  I wanted to meet her  You make a very valid point  I wanted to meet her  It should be the perks of the gig  You should be able to like  You know  Get some of this stuff done  Without it becoming a hassle  Every single time  Well Steve  I like Steve Leeds a lot  Steve is great  Liam is great  Yeah he's doing  He's doing good by us  Absolutely  Yes he is  So we didn't get her  Which is unfortunate  Because she would have  Had a great time on our show  We would have treated her  With nothing but respect  And I think she wanted  To talk about her music  More than  Yeah  More than  Her movies  Yeah  But what a dumb publicist  To not  I don't want to talk about  All of it 
[02:38:30]  No but she talked about it  With Sam a little bit  We'll play a couple clips  After the break  Yeah  And then  Oh and the other one  Which is frustrating  Is Quentin  Quentin did our show  Tarantino  And he had a blast with us  He did I think over an hour  Yes he did  That might be like  Just a time thing though  He invited us over his house  So I'm gonna knock on his door  And just show up  Unannounced one night  And when's he coming in  We even called him out on that  And he's like  No I really mean it  Yeah  I'm gonna end up in LA  During our two weeks off 
[02:39:00]  In his theater  I'm gonna  I'm gonna google map that shit  And I'm gonna knock on his door  Screen some movies with him  Yeah right  You will be so turned away  No kidding  Or he might invite you in for a beer  Just to get your information  You're who?  Yeah  You're what?  Who?  Get out of here  I'm a big fan of the fake invite  It's just  It happens  I'm a big fan of the fake invite  I am a big fan of it  Because I think it's hilarious  Because then you call him out  And they go  No I mean it  Next time you're in LA  Stop by  Anytime  And the famous story  I did it with Greg Brady  And got his leftovers  Yeah  Never again 
[02:39:30]  Jeff what do you got?  Hey I just wanted to tell you  You guys  I got a 42 year old brother  In law  That wears diapers  Just  For pure pleasure  Wears them everyday  He's your brother?

[02:41:00]  God's honest truth  They sleep in separate beds  Because he soils the bed  That is absolutely the truth  And he  She's walked in on him  And seen him  Rubbing his  Rubbing his  Cock with the diaper  And yeah  With the dirty diaper  He's a nut  Do they have kids?  No children  No  Why does she tell you all this?  Well  She does  Well  She tells my mom  And then I get the information  But  You can hear him  You can hear the diaper  Crickling when he walks 
[02:41:30]  Under his jeans  I mean  He's a lunatic  Come on  Come on  I want to so believe  I want to believe too  I want to so believe it's true  Listen  It's the truth  I'm a long time fan  I'm not going to give you a frunkus  I'm telling you  It's the God's honest truth  How can you prove this?  Well  You want pictures?  Yeah  Well  I mean  I can't prove it  Obviously  But it is  It is the truth  He went on a long 
[02:42:00]  Over the road  Truck and trailer ride  With his cousin  And his cousin said  The only way that he makes it  Through the long trips  Without stopping for bathroom breaks  Is to wear the diapers  Just  Because my brother-in-law  Started doing it  And he enjoys it  And he's been doing it  Ever since  Kyle S. from Indiana  I'm all in with this statement  How much attention  Does this guy need?  Oh wow  How much fucking attention  Oh does he need some attention?  How much nurturing 
[02:42:30]  How much mothering  Me me me  Mother me  Nurture me  Stop your life  To pay attention to me  Someone didn't get  Enough attention  As a young boy  Don't you hate that?  Stop your life  Exactly what it is  Stop your life  To pay attention to me  To me  I need to make it about me  You don't like cries for help?  Oh boy  I hate it  Jimmy knows dude  Shut up Jimmy  It makes me look like 
[02:43:00]  A complete asshole  No it doesn't  I agree with you  Not just a partial asshole  I completely agree with you  You look very accurate  The cry for help  Is the worst thing ever  But I do love  Anthony's impression  I took his few pills  I took a few pills  You never get answers  From these people  How many pills  Did you take?  Tell me  I don't  The bottles here  Well how many?  Count  Count how many pills  Are left  Look I don't remember

No  No that's it  I just wanted to let you guys know 
[02:45:00]  That's quite enough  It's happening out there  Do you feel like the guy needs attention?  Why do you think he's really doing this?  Well  I  That's my argument  That he just  Mommy didn't take care of him  When he was little  And  42  42 year old man  Asking my mom  42 years old  Wearing tighties  He needs nurturing  Alright  Yeah  It's tough to believe  Your phone call  To be completely honest with you  The one thing  That I really have  A tough time with  Is that he asked  Your mom  To change his diaper  Yeah 
[02:45:30]  Yeah he did  Listen  My  My dad  Had to go over  And tell him  If he was gonna do that  He needed to stay home  Alright  Now I know you're lying  Because there's not a dad alive  That is gonna  Accept  That his daughter  Married someone  That has to wear diapers  There's not a  There's not a father alive  I'm telling you  There's a lot of things  Fathers have to  You know  Put up with  But they're not gonna  Put up with  A 42 year old guy  Wearing diapers  Out and about  But it

[02:46:30]  Not that you want to think  Of your sister like that  But she probably likes it  Because his cock is fatter  Than most that she's had  And it hits the walls  A certain way  It could be man  I don't know  But I know  Scrapes the signs  On the way in  If you know what I mean  What tipped it off  When they were getting married  And they said  Do you take this bride  Boo  Oh god  He said  You may now kiss the bride

[02:49:00]  Are out there  Because people are like  Yeah I know somebody  That does this  Yeah  What's surprising  Is this guy  Is openly just wearing  Diapers in front of his family  His father-in-law  And making  His brother-in-law  That's what I don't  Really understand  Jeff  That's a good one  I'm telling you  It's a crazy house  She's hot  It's nuts  But I can't change it  For my sister  And if I could  I would  But I think a good  Hard thrashing  Would fix him  But I'm not allowed  To do that  What does your father say  Like to you  When this guy's not around 
[02:49:30]  My dad is the classic  Jimmy always brings it up  The classic passive-aggressive  When he's not around  He's ready to take care of business  But then when he's around  Everything's lovey-dovey  And peachy-fine  And that pisses me off too  But you know  Again  We  We had one experience  With an adult baby  And we were  We were told not  Not to laugh  And Ant and I

[02:55:30]  Oh wow  It's amazing  You did this  I know  The following is a public service announcement from Anthony Cumia  Founder of the National Transgender Advocacy Coalition  Yes I have both male and female genitalia  But I consider myself a female  It's just a little bit of a penis  And really doesn't interfere much with my life  The reason I haven't talked about it  Is it's not a big deal to me  Like come on  It's not like we all go around talking about our vag  I think this is a great opportunity  To make other multiple gendered people feel more comfortable with their bodies 
[02:56:00]  I'm sexy  I'm hot  I have both a poon and a peener  Big fucking deal  If you or someone you love is transgendered  Call the Opie and Anthony show on the number listed on your radio  And describe your delicious appendage to one of our intern call screeners  I heard Hannity in there  You're doing Hannity?

[03:02:00]  Isn't that better everyone  Ah yeah  That's great  Brought to you by  Danny's favorite website  How about a shovel in the head  He fucked  With a T  F-U-K-T  Yeah  And it's sister site  Inhumanity  Oh  Thank god  There is so much stuff  On the internet  It's just a magical place  A lot of it ain't noise  No  You guys want to hear  Sam's interview  With Juliette Lewis  Yes  I want to hear  What she's up to  I mean we got four clips here  Do you really want to 
[03:02:30]  Go through the whole thing  Or  Let's see how it goes  With the first clip  And we'll see if we want more  Juliette explains the difference  Between expressing yourself  Through music and acting  Oh Christ  That sounds very artsy-fartsy  Alright  I want to hear it  You do?  Yes  I want to hear it  She's so super sexy  You think still?  Fuck yeah man  I liked her in  From dusk till dawn  I love her  That was good  Juliette Lewis  Still sexy  Oh she's  Would you lick my pussy?  That was good  How old does she know? 
[03:03:00]  15  No she's gotta be  She's gotta be  Scraping  40  Maybe  Like you said  You put a lot of emotion  In yourself  Into this music now  Yeah  Creatively  What's the difference  Between doing that  And putting yourself  Into like a character  When you're acting  Like is there  Do you get out  More of yourself  Better through one?  Oh yeah  Absolutely  Because music's so personal  It's sort of like  You use the sound  She's crazy  To untap  All this 
[03:03:30]  All this emotion  Or these lyrics  Or all these things  That are living within yourself  It's this thing  Where you can constantly  Be dreaming  You know  I'll be in my car  And I was thinking  About something  And I wrote  And I was thinking  And I thought  I'm a hard loving woman  That's what I am  And I wrote a song  Called Hard Loving Woman  No way  It was sort of this declaration  It's a blues song  But of course  It's with all this  Personal feeling  And you have to  Allow yourself  To be really vulnerable 
[03:04:00]  So that's similar  In acting  Because it's acting too  I don't get into acting  To be cool  Or to be  You know  Play the same thing  I really like to  I really like diversity  And range  Wow  She's sexy  She would have had fun  On this show  Would she?  Yep  Wow  She sounds like a nut  That's what I'm saying  Must have been fun  To meet her  Well you weren't allowed to  You had to wait  An hour and 15 minutes  Holy shit 
[03:04:30]  It's amazing  Take me through that  Conversation again  Please  Julia Lewis is here  You want a picture  Steve  Can you ask  Our Steve  Yeah  And he asks somebody  In the  The booking department  And  I think Juliet's running  A little bit late  So I asked Steve  And he said  Well they said  It has to be like later  Because she's doing  An interview  So I go out  And I ask the person  And they say  Well she's doing  An interview  Maybe  You could have it 
[03:05:00]  An hour  At 11.45  Little boobies  And Steve goes  You're going to make  Them wait that long  And she said  Well she's coming back  In September  It was like  Again  I don't  I would assume  That hour and a half  Would be a lot  Of different interviews  So in between  An interview  She could easily  Take a quick shot  For real  Would never want  To disrupt  Somebody when they're  Going from one place  To another  I really wouldn't  But a five second picture  Yeah  Yeah  And let's be honest 
[03:05:30]  It's also  Julia Lewis  Promoting band  A band  Right  Not a movie  Not another film  With Robert De Niro  Or anything  It's  You know  Alright Julia Lewis  Talks about deciding  Which movies to do  You've done some  Really memorable  And off the wall  Things in movies  Like Natural Born Killers  And starting  You know  All the way back  In Cape Fear  And things like that  Are you at the point  Where you're just  You pick what you want  To do  Like you don't have  To take whatever  They try to get you  To do  You're just  Picking what you want 
[03:06:00]  Well it's weird  Because  You know  In American movies  You know  It's about currency  So it's about  Whatever  Whoever's been  In the last big movie  That's who  Sort of has cachet  And who'll get  Offered parts  So for me  I've been  I've made movies  For like 15 years  And I  I now  Work in music  Is my main  Concentration  And that's even  How I earn a living  So 
[03:06:30]  So I now  Only do movies  For if  If I'm in love  With the part  And if  And the people  Involve  If I really  Like them  And so  So  But no  I'm not in a place  Where I can pick  Things  You know  You gotta  You gotta  Really be involved  In your career  And stuff  And I'm sort of  Just like  I just do it  For the love of it  But in the sense  You pick what you  Want to do  Like you're not  Going to do something  That you're not  Like artistically linked to  Or that you're not  In love with  Oh for sure  You know 
[03:07:00]  Like I didn't  I always wanted  Something really  Sort of exposing  And I like things  That make me feel  Uncomfortable  A bit  Or that make me  Feel  In general  Try my cock  She's so hot  Is this  Interesting  Yeah  Yeah  Why  What have we  Listened to something  Well I see  Well that's interesting  The pictures  On Mr. Skin  Mr. Skin  Has some  Mr. Skin rules  Naked  Juliette Lewis  Pictures  That we're looking at  Juliette talks about 
[03:07:30]  Her uncomfortable scene  With Robert De Niro  In Cape Fear  This could be good  She sucked his fingers  Your scene  In Cape Fear  The scene where  You first meet  Robert De Niro's character  Yeah  It was probably  One of the most  Uncomfortable scenes  In any movie  Did you know  When you were doing it  That it was going to be  That uncomfortable  To watch  No I didn't know  I didn't know  Because I don't know  That perspective  Because of course  Because people  Still come up to me  Because my character  She doesn't know  He murdered a girl  Right  So she only knows 
[03:08:00]  Oh this is the guy  That might have killed  The dog  Do you know what I mean  And that's bad enough  For her  But it is  It's twisted  Because he's also  Being a friend  He's understanding her  But no  I didn't know  How uncomfortable  It's going to be  I still don't  You know  But I knew  It was incredible  To play  The tension  Yeah  There was this tension  Between De Niro and I  And what we were playing  That was so  Intense 
[03:08:30]  Yeah I mean  It really was one of those  Things that just hit  A raw nerve with people  Like no  Why is  How does he have this power  And why is she being  Drawn in like this  Robert you got something  To say  Julie Lewis  Describing that  That time  You sucked her thumb  Robert De Niro  Is about to speak  Well you know  I was just a raging bull 
[03:09:00]  Shut up stupid  Without a script  You're nothing  Yeah well you know  People didn't tell me  Who's going to be that  We have a fine art program  Remember New York  I shouldn't  How can you do that  To the great De Niro  De Niro blew me off  But she's 
[03:09:30]  She is a  She didn't have a clue  That  That's  Come on  Can I  Yes you can  Can I  Oh  Sure  What happened  Could I  Could we hear  A bit of her music  I have no idea  What it sounds like  What she does  He murdered a girl  Oh no  He murdered Abigail  Are you going to make  Juliet Lewis Band  Stop in the middle  Of a song  So you can address  The crowd  She put his dirty  Fingers  In the mouth 
[03:10:00]  Sam  He could have  Had botulism on them  I don't know  And by Sam  I mean the little  The little mixed  Racial kid  That works for the  Opinality show  Not my Asian house boy  You're Sam  In serious  Interviewer mode  No shit  And his voice  Tracks  It makes us all  Want to puke  I want to grab him  That's pretty obvious  Fucking stupid  That Wilma Flintstone  Hairdoot  And fucking  Push him through a window  Sam 
[03:10:30]  Did Juliet Lewis  Look hot  First of all  Yeah  Sexy  What'd she have on  Yeah but she was  Wearing like crazy person  Clothes  She had on this  Like black  Almost meshy  Kind of shirt  With like little ruffles  And then a glitter  Silver tank top  Over it  She smelled good  Yeah  Well I mean  Not like super  Perfumey  Like some celebrities  Do  Who was she with  Just a publicist  Like piss  No not like piss  She was actually like  She might have had  Somebody in the green room  But as far as I saw  She was by herself  Wait a minute  I just figured something out 
[03:11:00]  Jimmy couldn't get a picture  With Juliet Lewis  For an hour and 15 minutes  Because some of that  Time was being taken  Oh no no no  That was fine  How funny would that  No it would have been  It would have been  With Sam when he did it  Because Sam was scheduled  For 11.45  Ah  No I don't  A guy doing an interview  Is more  Sam  I don't  Way to go with the bitch  Jimmy  Way to go with the bitch  Jesus  I don't want it to seem  Like I'm bitching about  Inaccurately  But you are  I just think it would be funny  That you didn't get your picture 
[03:11:30]  Because Sam had  Special time  With you  I would actually understand that  Was she crazy Sam  Yeah  I mean she was loopy  She's very  Cool crazy  Artsy  Yeah  She's not like harmful crazy  So she makes her living now  Just with the band  Well she  And the royalty checks  That roll in from  She probably doesn't need  The cash  Yeah I wouldn't think so  She took like  Five years off  Making movies  And was just doing music  And then she came back  And made four movies  At once  And now she said  She's going back on tour  So she's taking another 
[03:12:00]  Hiatus on movies  What movies did she do recently  Really  Well I think the last one  She did  She was in old school  I mean that was  Kind of recent  But like she just filmed  She was in old school  Yeah she was the wife  With the internet gangbanks  Oh shit  You're right  Let's see  Catch and release  She was in  My name is Earl  Recently  Yeah she continues  To get work  What song you got Travis  By Julia Lewis  Anything  I have like  Five different songs

[03:13:00]  Or  Something  Shine  No I don't think so  Come Rain  Come Rain  Or Something  Well because  I already  Exactly  I already put it in the cart  So it cuts it off  What else would fit in there  Yeah  Come Rain  Or  It's gotta be  Come Rain  Or Drizzle  Fucking boob  Jesus Travis  Oh  Come Rain  Or  It's Come Rain  Or Come Shine  All right  Is this the old song  How old is this song  Hope it isn't  I don't know  I haven't  If it is I want to hear it

[03:27:30]  Yeah  Now that means he probably  Has to pay  Royalty fees  To somebody else  For his own song  Right  That's how it works right  I don't know  Maybe he would just do the song  And dare them to come after him  Yeah  You know how bad you'd look  Suing McCartney  For singing yesterday  Whatever  No it's not about just singing it  It's like if you put it out on  You know an album or something  You'd look ridiculous  But it wouldn't surprise me  If a lawyer did that  I mean they really are  Without scruples  But yeah  In nine short years  Paul McCartney will hit the jackpot again 
[03:28:00]  He's 60  He's 67  Wow  Paul McCartney's 67  Oh he  Travis is saying  He still gets royalties  Okay  He just doesn't own  The copyright  For the song  Yeah but you make money  Off the copyright  Yeah I would guess so  Well yeah  You know  But no one's gonna cry  Over this  He's worth 440 million pounds  Which is  737 million dollars  Yeah that's kind of a lot of money  You know whatever 
[03:28:30]  Jackson autopsy  To remain sealed  The results  Why  Why  They got him  Because they got a  It sounds like they got some doozies  Why  Why would they seal the autopsy  Yeah  Because of the investigation  The ongoing investigation  Okay  They've completed their probe  Until the death of Michael Jackson  So they know exactly everything now  But are not releasing the results just yet  Because of the investigation  That continues with the doctors  And what not  Yeah the doctors are probably sweating  Mystique around this guy 
[03:29:00]  Who gives a fuck  Everyone cares  I mean who gives a fuck  Like his autopsy report  Just put the fucking thing out  Who cares  You care  We all care  I read it  But it's like  Why care enough to not put it out  Yeah  That's what I'm saying  Put it out like any other  Tom Dick or pedo  And just fucking  Tom Dick or Mary  Very bad news for all you  Brooks and Dunn fans  Why is this on our prep sheet Travis 
[03:29:30]  Brooks and Dunn  Well you know  Like last time someone  Something  Something happened last time  Where you know  It's the top story on Yahoo Entertainment  So I figure it's a big story  Brooks and Dunn  And Elo seemed to care about it last night  On his Twitter  What  Elo  Elo's twittering about Brooks and Dunn  Yeah he did something last night  Why don't I follow Elo  Alright  How many people we got in here  Four  One  Let's try to do this  Okay  For real  They've been around 20 years 
[03:30:00]  Name one  One Brooks and Dunn song  Can you do it Ant  No  We're counting on you on this one  I can't  Just cause you'd spend a little time  With a country girl  Yeah  Country music loving girl  Not one  Yeah  Jimmy  Weigh me an option  Holy shit you're wrong  That's a song  Weigh me an option  That is  You couldn't have  Come up with something better  Weigh me an option 
[03:30:30]  That is the dumbest name for us all  What the fuck  Is it Friday yet  This is going to be a long three days  Weigh me an option  Oh does that stink  I think it's good  Well  No  It's terrible  I don't know about that Ant  Let me go to the master computer here  Yeah  That answer is  Up  Up 
[03:31:00]  False  Ah  Not weigh me an option  Oh  Well  How about  Cry me a river of cum  What the fuck would that look like  Or um  Wait um  Hold on  Texas hemorrhoid  No  Well the big news 
[03:31:30]  Truck driving mother  Fuggity fuckity fuckity  Someone says  Didn't Brooks and Dunn sing  My hat is filled with jizz  My hat is filled with jizz  My hat is filled with jizz  Brooks and Dunn calling it quits after 20 years  Is that one of their songs? 
[03:32:00]  But about marriage that breaks up  Brooks and Dunn  Hey  Who gives a fuck about Brooks and Dunn  Exactly  The house next door to me  Did you write that one?  James in Chicago  We were talking about plagiarism  Copyright  Royalties  All that  Infringments  Of that sort  Yeah  Infringing  Infringments  James what do you got  Yeah  I remember a few years ago  John Fogarty was sued  By um  Creighton's old manager 
[03:32:30]  For plagiarizing one of his own songs  A song he wrote in his solo days  They said it was um  A rip off of  I believe it was  Old Man's Down the Road  And I forgot the name of the other song  But they said yeah  It might have been  Run Through the Jungle  And the Old Man Down the Road  Right  Yeah I believe so  Did he lose Fogarty?  Well  The Fogarty thing gets even better  We haven't thought about this in years  But I do believe he had to sue himself  Yeah  If you can find that story  For real  Somehow it just makes sense  No 
[03:33:00]  The manager tried to sue him  Yeah but there was another part of this puzzle  I'm telling you  I'm sticking by this  Where it got so crazy  That he somehow sued himself  To get out of this legal mumbo jumbo  Right  We'll try to find the story  Thank you James  No problem guys  Alright bro  Yeah he had to go to court to sue himself  What's a Brooks and Dunn song?  Oh let me see  Let's go to Nathan  From Santa Barbara  Nathan  Hey what's going on boys?
