<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opened with a raucous discussion of the USA vs. Canada Olympic hockey game.  The hosts, using copious vulgar language, praised Ryan Miller’s goaltending and mocked NBC’s coverage prioritization of ice dancing over the hockey match.  Callers from Buffalo (Anthony), Vancouver (Ahmad Ali), Lake Placid, and other locations shared their perspectives, ranging from fervent support for the US to more measured opinions.  One caller, Jack, even argued the game’s significance was overblown. The hosts interspersed the hockey discussion with mockery of Tiger Woods' apology, a brief discussion of Alexander Haig's infamous “I’m in control here” quote, and the display of a picture of a topless female curler.  The segment concluded with further hockey commentary and details of the hosts’ weekend activities.

The show then transitioned to Anthony’s new personal trainer and his recent bowling injury. He recounted his underwhelming first session, complaining about the trainer’s passive approach and contrasting it with his ideal of a more aggressive, "old school" style. Anthony detailed his wrist, shoulder, and groin injuries sustained bowling, revealing he'd registered a .08 or .09 BAC on a breathalyzer before the activity.  The hosts launched into a discussion about the dangers of Long Island cab rides, comparing them, albeit controversially, to drunk driving.  Listener calls followed, mostly mocking Anthony’s lack of workout progress, weight, and his trainer, with suggestions for a female trainer to provide more motivation.  The conversation jumped to the Sidney Crosby vs. Alex Ovechkin debate, steroids, the unattractiveness of Snooki, and included antisemitic jokes. The segment concluded with further criticism of Tiger Woods' press conference, questioning its sincerity and speculating on his motivations (sex addiction vs. image repair), and ended with a news report about a taxi passenger seriously injured in an accident.  The segment included short bits, such as a Black History Month tribute to Keith David and jokes at Anthony's expense.

The next segment delved deep into the Tiger Woods apology, dissecting the press conference for its perceived lack of sincerity.  The hosts and callers debated whether Woods was truly remorseful or simply damage-controlling.  Speculation about Elin Nordegren's motives for staying with him, focusing on financial aspects, dominated much of the conversation. Callers offered varied opinions, with some defending Woods and others condemning his insincerity.  The hosts' own past apologies were also called into question by some callers. The hosts played clips from Woods' apology, analyzing his body language, and played audio from interviews with some of his mistresses and their lawyers, particularly Gloria Allred, often using highly offensive language to describe the mistresses. The segment ended with continued discussion of the apology's authenticity and the involved parties’ reactions, with frequent mention of "Boner."

The final segment focused heavily on Tiger Woods' extramarital affairs, featuring a discussion of a pornographic actress claiming a relationship with him, with the hosts reading aloud the titles of her adult films ("Mama Fucked a Black Man," "Milf Blown," "My First Sex Teacher," etc.).  This transitioned into a heated debate between Gloria Allred and Janine Pirro (from a Sean Hannity show clip), regarding the actress's claim to deserve an apology. The hosts reacted with expletives, further fueled by a caller, Morris from Tennessee, adding another adult film title ("Tin Cunt").  The conversation veered off to other topics: the success of *The Hurt Locker*, *Shutter Island*'s box office, upcoming films like *Alice in Wonderland*, Governor David Paterson's low approval ratings, a man who bulldozed his own house to avoid foreclosure, and a caller recounting Governor Paterson being booed at a minor league hockey game.  The segment concluded with discussion of an "Arizona penis tree," reaction to unsubstantiated rumors from "Bobo" about Elin Nordegren attempting to castrate Tiger Woods, and golf-themed jokes about the pornographic actress's film titles.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  I believe we put on a fine show every day, but let's not be mistaken, we are the dumbest  guys in radio.  Ew, it's Opie and Anthony, this place sucks. 
[00:00:30]  There's no mistake about it, we are the dumbest guys in broadcasting.  Anybody that doesn't appreciate this radio show can go and kill yourself.  Kill yourself.  What will happen today?  I can't believe anyone is still listening to this show.  Oh, you want me to fuck your dick?  Yeah.  I'm going to tell you my balls smell like a ham and monster on wheat.  I'm going to sneeze your crumbs so good.  This is going to be another stupid show.  Enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road.  Yeah, let's do just that. 
[00:01:00]  It's going to be a busy show today.  Is it?  Well, we got lots to talk about.  We certainly do.  I'm in control here at the White House.  At the White House.  All right, I froze up instantly.  I'm in control here at the White House.  Lost Alexander Haig over the weekend.  Ah, that's a bitch.  I'm in control here at the White House.  That sucks.  I think people should drink, man.  That's pretty close.  That's a close Alexander Haig right there. 
[00:01:30]  You think?  Why are my headphones all muffled today, Mars?  Are they muffly?  I know I'm a little congested.  Maybe it's me.  Maybe there's a button that's not pushed or something.  Everything's good.  I'm in control here at the White House.  That's like, house.  Does he say house?  Yeah, yeah.  It's like, ah.  He was all shaky.  He was a little shaky at the end.  Well, we could start with that.  I think he was a little nervous. 
[00:02:00]  I remember being a little kid when that was going down.  That was after old Ronnie Reagan got blasted.  Yeah, a lot younger than I am now.  And I didn't mind that statement because we didn't know if Ronnie Reagan was going to  pull through.  No.  It was nice that someone got on TV and said, look, I'm in control here at the White House.  Said they were in charge.  Basically meaning they were taking the phone calls that were coming into the White House.  Yeah.  At a fervent pace. 
[00:02:30]  A lot of people misunderstood that statement as he was saying he's the next in line.  Yeah.  You know, if the president died.  But he just meant the next person in line wasn't there at the White House.  Right.  So he was at the White House, like you said, fielding phone calls.  Yeah, he was in control.  He's the guy in charge.  Sure.  There at the White House.  At the White House.  At the White House.  Well, he died over the weekend in, what, 85, I think.  And man, it's the dumbest things that get you in the end. 
[00:03:00]  It was complications from an infection.  What?  Just complications from an infection.  Take some penicillin.  What happened?  Well, you would think.  What happened?  Why are we talking about Alexander Haig?  Most of the people that listen to us don't even know the guy.  I don't know about that.  He was a war hero.  I remember he was like the guy, the war hawk kind of a guy.  A lot of people were afraid of him back in the Reagan days.  Well, he also.  Thinking he was the guy that was going to, you know, stir up some warfare. 
[00:03:30]  Sure.  He also worked under good old Nixon, right?  Yes.  Did a little Nixon action.  A little tricky dick.  And then Alexander Haig went for the presidency in, I think, I would guess, 88.  88.  With Bush Sr., right?  Damn, yep.  Against Bush Sr., and he got his ass kicked.  Certainly did.  So, well, Alexander Haig.  Godspeed.  I guess just to make it official, we got a 20-second clip here about good old Mr. Haig. 
[00:04:00]  The four-star general served Republican presidents from Nixon to Reagan, and is perhaps best remembered  for this statement in the moments after Reagan was shot.  As of now, I am in control here in the White House.  Haig later explained that he wasn't trying to usurp anyone or go beyond the Constitution,  but rather reassure the country that the White House was still functioning.  See, he never lived down that statement.  I know.  But, like you said, it made complete sense.  Made perfect sense.  At that moment, he goes, here, at the White House. 
[00:04:30]  He didn't say, the country.  Right.  So, he just, you know, whatever.  Just hanging out there at the White House going, yeah, I'm in charge until, you know,  somebody more important comes in the door.  Yeah.  In, like, a minute.  He was basically there to take out the garbage and get the mail.  You know, field some phone calls.  Right, do the lawn if it needed some trimming.  Whatever.  And he paused perfectly.  I'm in control here.  Here.  He said, here.  At the White House.  House. 
[00:05:00]  I say White House.  Yeah.  Well, let's talk hockey, of course.  Hockey, hockey.  I'm fucking exhausted, Anthony, because I was on the edge of my seat last night.  Ooh.  Watching this goddamn Olympic hockey.  That's uncomfortable.  On the edge?  That's your hiney hurt.  It really is.  You've got to get the full cushion.  It really is very uncomfortable.  And then when I went to bed, I had so much adrenaline from watching hockey, how it should  be played.  Yeah.  That I couldn't sleep.  Really?  I finally, like, fell asleep somewhere after midnight. 
[00:05:30]  And we get up, you know, in the 4 a.m. hour.  Mm-hmm.  Uh, but I got to tell you, man, this USA versus Canada game yesterday, I was trying to remember  a more exciting game in my lifetime.  And even, like, growing up and watching the Islanders win the Cup, I don't remember it  being as exciting as it was last night.  Yeah, that, I guess, was like the be-all, end-all of hockey.  And it was, and the game wasn't for a medal or anything. 
[00:06:00]  It was just preliminaries.  Yeah.  Just to stay in it.  And believe it or not, I'm hoping that there's another USA versus Canada game.  I really hope.  Absolutely.  You mean Canada's still in?  Canada's still in, yes.  And how does that happen if we beat them?  Well, no, it's like, they're playing like a mini-season.  Really?  Yeah, they play a mini-season, like three or four games, and then they have to-  I thought it was, you lose your oot.  No, then they have to qualify for the medal round, and then finally you can play for the  gold.  Wow.  Yeah, so. 
[00:06:30]  But, uh-  I don't think I like that.  USA was not favored, obviously.  I mean, hockey is Canada's game.  Of course it is.  It's not America's game.  No.  And, uh, and honestly, I guess I gotta say that Canada completely outplayed the United  States of America.  Really?  But we have this guy in goal, uh, Miller, who was standing on his head.  Safe, safe, safe?  Yeah, they like to say that when a goalie's unbelievable.  Standing on his head.  He's standing on his head. 
[00:07:00]  Not literally.  No.  Oh, okay, because that would- wow, that would be hard.  Yeah, but they like to say that.  So, Miller was standing on his head and kept, uh, the Americans in that game last night.  Kicking out.  Unbelievable.  Kicking out some saves.  Kicking.  I love those kick saves.  All sorts of crap going on.  But, uh, first time, I didn't know this, Travis told me, the first time, uh, United States  became in Olympic hockey in 50 years.  50 years?  50 years.  What did that look like?  Huh?  What did that look like?  Oh, I'm kidding.  Wearing old leather bomber hats and stuff. 
[00:07:30]  Like, for some reason, every sport back then, you had to wear, like, a bomber hat.  They just couldn't figure it out.  Like, you got out of a B-17 and decided you were going to play a sport.  Their materials back then sucked.  I couldn't figure anything out.  No.  But, uh, it was an amazing game.  And I'm an Islanders fan.  I can't go back to watching the damn Islanders after this Olympic hockey.  What was there so different about it that made it like, wow, this game is better than  watching, like, NHL hockey?  Uh, well, I mean, this game meant everything. 
[00:08:00]  They were hyping this game forever.  And, uh, it was just action.  A lot of action.  From beginning to the end.  And the announcers, they were going, like, hoarse.  Because they had to try to keep up with all the action.  And that's not happening in NHL hockey?  That's kind of just like, you know what?  When you play 80-some-odd games a year, are you really going to get up for each game  like they did last night?  Oh, okay.  Yeah, I gotcha.  So, I mean, every second mattered in that game yesterday. 
[00:08:30]  That's why.  Because a lot of people...  It was boxing.  No, no clinching.  Oh, no.  Holding on.  Like heavyweights.  I can't stand that.  Yeah, just imagine a boxing match where they just punch each other in the head over and  over and over again.  Okay.  All right.  Yeah.  So, I don't know what to say about the game, but I was just totally into it.  A lot of people saying, hey, man, because of you, I was watching, and, oh, I'm a hockey  fan now.  And I'm like, oh, buddy.  Oh, no.  The NHL doesn't get that exciting.  Hey, hockey sucks now.  No.  I mean, the NHL playoffs get really exciting. 
[00:09:00]  Yeah.  In the later rounds.  But last night, you're not going to see a game like that.  It was...  I can't stress that enough.  Yeah, a lot of people were very excited.  Twitter going crazy about the game.  Yeah.  Let's say hi to Anthony and Buffalo.  Oh.  I want to thank Buffalo for their fine goalie.  This Mr. Miller did his job last night.  What's up, Anthony?  Hey, what's going on, man?  How are you feeling today? 
[00:09:30]  Oh, I'm feeling good.  But we are in control of the Olympics.  Let's calm down.  Yeah, not the White House.  Not the White House, but we are in control of the Olympics.  Well, I mean, it's looking good for the United States of America, but I don't know.  I think we dodged a bullet last night, to be completely honest with you.  You really think I'll play?  You know what it is, guys?  It's still one.  I'm so sick of the fucking cocky fucking Canucks over there from Canada. 
[00:10:00]  That's all they do is they fucking brag about how fucking good they are, and when they lose,  they cry.  Isn't this what the Olympics is all about?  Calling other countries cocky fucks?  Right.  Isn't this supposed to be about coming together in sport?  In sport, and you nodding and showing each other the fucking Canadiens.  Now it's cocky fucks.  Well, they were very cocky for this game.  Yeah, well, of course.  You know something?  It's their sport.  I think it's a little awkward in Canada today. 
[00:10:30]  Yeah?  Oh, yeah.  It's got to be very awkward.  How was the Teff family feeling last night?  Let me speak with you.  A representative from the Teff family.  Second in command.  No, first in command.  You are not the Al Haig of the Teff family, by the way.  Your wife is.  First in command.  I don't care.  I'm in control here.  She wears the trousers.  We are in control here.  Shut up.  I'm trying to talk to Travis.  What was going on over there?  Was there deep depression?  Well, on one side of the family, yes. 
[00:11:00]  Now, you were representing the United States?  Of course I was.  You didn't fag out and go to the wife's side?  No.  Just because you didn't want to get browbeaten or anything?  No.  Me and Riley, we were rooting for the USA.  How do you know that little, tiny baby Riley is a USA fan?  Because every time I said, USA, USA, she smiled at me.  So I say, well, let's see.  That must be great.  You've got to get a Merle, man.  Yeah, exactly.  In my family, it's Rangers and Islanders fans.  So when that kid pops out, and whenever anyone has a kid, you have to work them immediately. 
[00:11:30]  Oh, I know.  I see friends of mine, they just, the second it's out of the womb, they're strapping a  fucking Yankee onesie on the little kid.  That's what we do.  She's already got her Oriole onesies and her Canadian onesies and her Ravens onesies.  Committing her to the Orioles.  A lifetime of disappointment.  Travis, what did you think of the game last night?  It was great.  It was one of the best hockey games I've ever seen.  Ever?  Ever.  And Travis, a hockey fan.  They played like everyone expected them to play. 
[00:12:00]  Everybody knew that this meant something to the U.S. and Canada.  So you're saying they came with a game face on?  They sure did.  They came to play.  They came to play.  And it was not a disappointment at all.  If it was a blowout on either side, it would have been like, all right, you know.  Well, how many saves did Miller have?  Like 42?  42 or 43?  Jesus Christ.  That's insane, Anthony.  And Brodeur had 20, I want to say 22, Travis?  No.  Well, there was 23 shots on goal, so. 
[00:12:30]  Okay.  What?  18?  So, yeah.  17.  There you go.  United States had 23 shots on goal.  Canada had 42, 43.  I'm telling you.  Canada.  All right.  Then the goalie won the fucking game.  That's what I'm saying.  He was unbelievable.  Miller was standing on his head.  Standing on his head.  There it is.  I got to see that.  Let me go back to Buffalo.  I'm going to watch that.  Anthony, you still there?  Yes.  You're all day.  Miller time, baby.  Miller time.  Oh, is that what they're calling it?  Miller time in Buffalo.  That's right.  Oh, Miller time. 
[00:13:00]  I get it.  That's right.  It's Miller time in Buffalo.  Yeah, we heard.  All right, Sarah.  We got to let you go.  Mike in Jersey.  Mike.  He's drunk.  Hey, I just want to tell you the reason why I thought it was so exciting.  It was like an All-Star game.  Everybody was a superstar, but they didn't play like the All-Star game.  In the All-Star game, you know, people get a free pass.  They don't play defense that hard.  This was intense.  People were beating the crap out of each other, but they were all super surprised.  All right.  That's what I wanted to know, too.  Any goons, you know, really hitting them?  You can't really fight in Olympic hockey. 
[00:13:30]  I don't mean goon and like throwing the gloves down and punching each other.  No, there was a lot of...  But like, I want to see the boards take some abuse.  Oh, yeah.  A lot of really good hits.  And he's right.  I mean, when you see...  That's why All-Star games suck a dick.  Because you see all these guys like they're the best at their sport, but they don't play that  way in All-Star games because it doesn't mean anything, and they don't want to get hurt.  So they're kind of just going through the motions, especially in the NHL All-Star game.  Yeah.  But here you go.  You got the All-Stars, but it means everything.  So you're going to see them really play. 
[00:14:00]  Yep.  All right.  Well...  Very good.  That's the way it is right there, sir.  You're right.  Sorry I missed it.  Let me go to Chris in Lake Placid.  Chris?  He's watching Iceman.  Yeah, good morning.  You know, 30 years ago today in Lake Placid...  Listen, Lake Placid is our Bundy moment.  Opie, could you please leave it alone?  It really is.  That's the only thing...  The Bundy moment.  The Bundy moment.  That's the only thing you guys are really known for.  30 years ago in Lake Placid, a little no-team. 
[00:14:30]  Hanging on with our fingertips up here with us.  I just...  Are you sick of it?  What's that?  Are you sick of it?  Well, kind of a little bit, but it's fun.  You know, it brings some attention to the area, but those boys last night weren't playing  for money.  They weren't playing for anything, but the fact that they were Canadians on the other bench  and those boys, we call it in hockey, following through with your check.  Following through, right on. 
[00:15:00]  And Brodeur...  Even after they move the puck, it doesn't matter.  You've still got two strides to drill them into the glass.  Where's our Canadian friends today?  They usually call it up.  I've got to ask you something about Lake Placid there.  Is the Olympic Village, like, falling apart?  Or is it still there?  No, no, no.  It's...  They really do a good job taking care of the venues and everything, but we call it Lake Plastic.  Lake Plastic?  Why Lake Plastic?  Well, because you never really get a sense of a feel over there, like you're really talking 
[00:15:30]  to anyone genuine.  I love the area, but boy, they're pompous over there a little bit, because they're hanging  on to those 80 Olympics with their fingertips.  They're really trying to...  Do you believe in miracles?  Do you see that slogan everywhere you go?  Well, yeah.  You know, people don't realize how different that whole deal was, but boy, last night was  fun, man.  I couldn't go to sleep either.  Yeah, it really was, Dan, as far as hockey goes.  And actually, a bunch of people that never really got into hockey really enjoyed the game 
[00:16:00]  last night.  Yeah.  Thank you, Chris.  Let me go to Jack in Rhode Island.  Jack.  I've got to tell you, man.  I love you, Opie, but this game is not what you're making this game out to be, man.  But, I mean, this is two NHL teams.  I mean, it's not like 1980 when there was a bunch of kids that went and beat the Russians.  I mean, that U.S. team is full of...  They're all NHL players.  I think it was a great game, but...  I mean, you're a big hockey fan.  Can you tell me you've never seen a playoff game in the Stanley Cup playoffs that was better 
[00:16:30]  than that game last night?  Well, you've got to remember, sir, that my Islanders have not been in a big playoff game  in many, many years to start with.  Right, sometimes.  Does it get exciting?  The NHL playoffs?  Of course it does.  The Stanley Cup Finals?  Of course it does.  But that game was just unbelievable from when they dropped the puck to the end.  There's no question it was a good game, but here's the thing about that game.  First of all, Miller, the goalie for the U.S., Buffalo's head coach, who Miller plays for 
[00:17:00]  Buffalo, their head coach is the assistant coach on Team Canada.  So there's not a big rivalry there.  Langenbrunner, who's a two-goal...  Hold on, hold on, hold on.  You've got to slow down.  You just casually say there wasn't a big rivalry there.  You didn't see a big fucking rivalry on the ice?  Well, let me ask you a question.  The coach for the Sabres, what do you think he wants Miller to do? 
[00:17:30]  Now, he wants him to lose the game, obviously.  But you think he wants him to lose at the expense that he would ever get hurt in that game?  You would think the coach of the Buffalo Sabres is going to take a shot of losing the Stanley Cup to win that game?  So what?  Miller was just calling it in last night?  No, no.  I'm not saying that at all.  Fucking Crosby almost took him out.  Crosby scored himself last night.  He was standing on his head.  Crosby...  That's not what I'm saying to you.  I'm not saying what I'm saying to you.  Apparently you are.  What I'm saying to you, the assistant coach for Canada is the head coach of the Buffalo Sabres. 
[00:18:00]  Yeah, I understand.  What do you think is more important to that guy?  But it...  All right.  Thank you, Jack.  But you're insane.  That means you're saying Miller wasn't really, like, he was just going through the motions?  No, but I'm not saying that at all.  What I'm trying to say is that the coach for...  Wow, you're a buzzkill, Jack.  Jack, you're a buzzkill.  What's the matter with you?  Everyone's excited today.  And by the way, Lane and Brudel, who scored two goals last night for the USA, is Brodeur's teammate. 
[00:18:30]  Yeah, I understand all that.  It's just not that big of a rivalry.  I mean, you're making a sound like these guys...  All right, Jack.  I can't be...  Jack's bringing everyone down today.  He's the one guy.  You saw a game last night where they didn't care who won or lost?  So he's pretty much saying that Brodeur let him score because they're on the same team.  No fucking way.  Hey, although Brodeur has USA on his hockey stick, which is weird because he's playing for Canada. 
[00:19:00]  That is odd.  He probably should have switched up his stick or put some tape over the USA part.  Let's go to Ahmad Ali.  Remember our friend from Vancouver?  Of course.  He's covering the Olympics for somebody.  I don't remember who.  What's up, Ahmad?  How's it going?  All right, man.  It is like...  It is...  Basically, the country's in mourning today in Vancouver.  It is a sad atmosphere here.  Losing to the U.S. in hockey is like the worst thing that could happen to us.  Well, it's a bit awkward up there.  I'm going to say not this morning. 
[00:19:30]  There was over 100,000 people in the streets all watching the game on big screens.  Yeah.  And it was just...  After, it was like a bomb went off.  It was awful.  Yeah.  A lot of people depressed?  Yeah.  People walking around.  Probably a lot of people calling in the sickle.  Yesterday, like, the stores were empty.  Everything was just shut down.  Like, in Canada, it was like...  It was like Super Bowl Sunday in Canada.  Yeah.  And everybody's getting ready to watch the big game.  It settled in, and it was like 4.30 local time.  Perfect timing.  Yeah.  And by the time the game was over, it was like the worst. 
[00:20:00]  It was unbelievable.  I mean, the one thing I'll agree with Jack, by the way, you can't really compare this game  to the 1980, you know, hockey team, because that was made up of college, you know, guys,  not pros.  So, it is different as far as that goes.  But I saw two teams that desperately wanted to beat the shit out of the other team.  You should see the papers up here.  Everyone's eating that coach alive, and the goalie, and, man.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  They're ready to string them up, man. 
[00:20:30]  Those guys can't work.  Those guys are public enemy number one right now.  Losing to the U.S. is like the worst thing you can do.  That's what I'm trying to say today.  This is hysterical, man.  This was a big fucking night.  Why can't we just come together?  It was a big night.  The spirit of competition.  Like Travis said, the U.S. hasn't beat Canada in Olympic hockey in 50 years.  It was a big fucking night.  I don't know what Jack was talking about.  It was a buzzkill.  There's little that we can beat the U.S. in.  This is one of the few things is hockey.  And war. 
[00:21:00]  Well, we can't really beat them in war.  That's what I mean.  We would beat you in war, too.  Maybe.  That's pretty easy.  We did a pretty good job in 1812.  Oh, no, you didn't.  We're still here.  Yeah.  We burned down the White House.  Yeah.  Oh, wow.  It needed to be rebuilt anyway.  The whole White House.  That's true.  Believe me, after another couple of years, they're probably going to want to burn it down and build it again.  No kidding.  No kidding.  Hey, Ahmad, there's a big story here as far as hockey goes. 
[00:21:30]  A lot of people are outraged because NBC, you know, they decided that ice dancing was way more important than this hockey game.  Now, that's what I was watching.  You were checking out the guy in the cowboy hat and the cowboy chaps dancing around the ice.  Exactly.  It wasn't even figure skating.  It was ice dancing.  Look, if you don't understand the sport, don't hate it.  Don't hate on ice dancing.  What about the puffy shirts they just showed on the news?  When the wind blows, when they're skating down the ice, it looks beautiful. 
[00:22:00]  Yeah.  You know what's confusing about that ice dancing?  The Canadian pair went out, they did the Spanish dance.  Then the American pair did an Indian dance, like a Bollywood dance.  Then the Chinese pair goes out and they do like a Mexican dance.  It's like, what the hell?  Why didn't they just do their own country kind of dancing?  Well, the Israeli one, they did a pretty Jewish dance. 
[00:22:30]  Oh, they did?  Boy, I'm so bummed I missed the ice dancing competition last night.  It was on network TV down in the States.  But NBC should be embarrassed that they made that decision.  I mean, if you have Olympic coverage on your network, you know, because they're going to argue that more people would rather watch ice dancing than hockey, which blows me away.  But if that's the truth, whatever.  But if you have the coverage, you have to show hockey over ice dancing.  You have to.  Well, they're saying that a lot of the people who don't normally watch sports, who get to watch Sunday night programming, you know, enjoy watching ice dancing. 
[00:23:00]  But see, here's the problem.  Like, as far as the Olympics go, I think if they if they give the Olympics to a network, I think the Olympic committee has a say in what is shown on TV.  What is happening here is NBC decided we can't make as much money if we show a hockey game because you don't have as many commercial breaks.  True.  So they were thinking of the almighty dollar and that's what I'm thinking. 
[00:23:30]  And people would people say, well, what's the big deal?  It was on MSNBC.  Well, a few things.  A lot of people that do have MSNBC don't have it in high def.  And then there were a lot of people that just didn't have the fucking MSNBC on their system.  So they missed out on the game.  Well, there's a ton of Americans who are into the game because, I mean, there was a lot of Americans up here for it.  And they were all looking to go to the hockey game over anything else.  Of course.  They couldn't go to any event.  They were all looking to the hockey game. 
[00:24:00]  NBC.  NBC.  It's an embarrassment today because you had one of the better hockey games in recent memory on TV last night.  And they chose not to show it because they had to show ice dancing.  I flipped over at one point and there was some kind of broke back mountain guy on ice with some chick that he was going ill.  Oh, a chick?  Those two guys.  They might as well have had spit in his hand.  That's a good move.  He's doing the spit in the hand move.  And there it is.  He's just fucked him in the ass.  Yeah.  Enough with the illusion that these ice dancers and these male figure skaters actually like the bra they're skating with. 
[00:24:30]  You might as well just have two men on the ice skating around.  No.  Well, the rights for the Olympics are up.  The broadcast rights.  And apparently Fox is making a big push.  Well, supposedly the NHL not happy and basically saying, look, we're not letting our boys play in the next Olympics.  Fuck this.  Well, yeah, plus it's in Russia.  Yeah.  But, I mean.  Go all the way there.  And then I flipped over to NBC in between periods.  And now they're showing Bodie Miller.  He won a gold last night. 
[00:25:00]  But who cares?  Everyone knew he won the gold medal in the afternoon.  Because you can't hold back that info anymore.  Yeah.  You got to go Twitter.  You got to, like, go Twitter dark.  So now they're showing, like, a sport that everyone already knows the results of.  Yeah.  As on, and this hockey game is just, was getting more and more crazy as the game went on.  Well, NBC is also tape delaying the Olympics in the time zone that they're taking place in.  So they're taking place, like, an hour away from, two hours away from Seattle. 
[00:25:30]  And people in Seattle get to see it tape delayed even in their local times.  So, I mean, they really have no excuse.  Unbelievable.  All right.  High ratings, though, man.  The Winter Olympics.  Doing well?  They can't ask this year.  They beat American Idol.  Yeah.  Well, but that ice dancing last night, that's just fucking ridiculous.  You mean good, right?  Some of them guys, they were standing on their heads.  Who would you like the best?  Puffy shirt guy?  I liked, um. 
[00:26:00]  Or Brokeback Mountain guy?  I liked the, uh, like that Spanish outfit with the big puffy shirt.  Yeah.  And, uh, puffy pants.  Did you see the Amish?  No, I didn't see the Amish.  There was a pair that they kind of looked Amish.  Amish-y.  I'll be honest with you.  I could not have been further away from the Olympics last night.  I know.  What's wrong with you?  I'm just not in, I'm not a big sports guy.  I watched a marathon of disappeared and forensic files. 
[00:26:30]  Right.  They all get caught the same way.  Don't they watch the show?  Uh, Mike G from Jersey writes, oh, the reason the game was so great last night is because  the rink is, uh, two feet wider, which gives the guys a little more room, uh, than NHL  rinks.  And then he writes, oh, and the refs let them commit murder.  The refs do let them just fucking play, play the sport.  Plow into each other.  Ahmad, everybody wants in, so I'm going to let you go.  If you want to call back later and, uh, give us some more Olympic coverage, that'd be great. 
[00:27:00]  All right, man, but the rink was actually not wider.  They went with the NHL standard for this tournament.  Oh, they did, huh?  Yeah.  Fuck, I just learned something.  I always assumed it was, uh, wider.  All right, thanks.  No, no, they usually are for international, but the guys who own the rink were like, screw  that.  We're not, we're not getting the seats out of there.  Oh, you know what?  Yeah, because that's where the Canucks play.  Yeah, of course.  So they would have to rearrange their whole rink.  Oh, yeah, the whole rink.  Yeah.  I'm sorry.  You're right, Ahmad.  Yeah, no problem.  All right, brother.  Thanks.  Uh, Brian in D.C.  Brian.  Boy, this is the greatest day in U.S. hockey history. 
[00:27:30]  Well, I don't think in, in, uh, U.S. hockey history.  I don't know.  Canada losing to us is like us losing to Afghanistan.  Yeah, it would be.  It's not supposed to happen.  Yeah, it would be very awkward here in the United States if, uh, we lost to Afghanistan.  Afghanistan and the world.  Right.  It's absolutely not supposed to happen.  They're stacked with absolutely everybody.  And, uh, we have a bunch of young nobodies.  Sure, they're all NHL players, but not a one of them, uh, is going to be, you know, 
[00:28:00]  the, the, the top guy in the NHL this, this year.  So, it's just an embarrassment to Canada.  And they're all just looking at their little maple leaf and drinking their moulton and  crying in a snowbank.  Right.  Crying in a snowbank.  All right.  You know what?  Let's hear from Canada.  Ah, good.  Here we go.  Let's go to James in Canada.  James.  Good morning.  Nope.  It's your favorite air traffic controller crying in his beer.  Oh, fuck.  I love this guy.  Dude, I'm not.  You know, yesterday, my buddy and I, we went down South Carolina to play golf for a week 
[00:28:30]  and we arranged it.  We walked off Pinehurst number two at four o'clock, drove 1,500 miles north to get home  for the game.  Jesus.  And, um, it, it, there, there's going to be funerals all over the fucking place today.  Yeah.  I mean, this was like a Super Bowl type, uh, situation.  Oh, yeah.  Like, this place will be shut down.  They'll have, they'll have a parliamentary investigation on what the fuck happened.  I love this guy.  Because I, I even picked this team and there was all kinds of controversy. 
[00:29:00]  Do you take Dowdy?  Do you take Keith?  Do you take Brodeur?  Do you put in Flurry?  I mean, Brodeur was out there playing fucking baseball last night, hitting it back to the  blue line so somebody could shoot it by him.  You see that?  Crazy.  Yeah, he was, uh, I, I, I don't know.  I mean, uh, Canada outplayed the United States.  I, I, I have to admit that.  Miller was standing, standing on his head.  Standing on his head.  Yeah, that goes back to Squaw Valley, too.  But, I mean, Miller was, Miller was tough.  And look what happened to Canada against Switzerland.  I mean, Hiller from the Anaheim Ducks, he, he played tough. 
[00:29:30]  And, and they took Canada into overtime.  Now Canada's going to play Germany.  Well, if they don't win that, we're going to sell ourselves to fucking Afghanistan.  And, and, uh, and, uh, then they, if they, if they beat Germany, then they get Russia  in the quarters.  That's no treat.  Cause Ovechkin wants blood.  Yeah, I'm, I'm team Ovechkin all the way.  No.  Sorry.  Sorry to Pittsburgh.  I would assume the Russians probably have a pretty good team.  Uh, yeah, they do.  Yeah.  Oh yeah.  They got, absolutely. 
[00:30:00]  They got Ovechkin.  They got anything, you know, they're, they don't, again, in a short tournament like  this.  Hold on, sir.  Hold on.  They're showing ice dancing, uh, fucking highlights, highlights on NBC.  Yeah.  We consider ice dancing a commercial for AIDS.  So we don't want that a lot.  I don't blame you, man.  I mean, it's rough to watch regular figure skating.  Now, now it's figure skating, but it's not as important.  No, no.  It's not like figure skating is like the fucking creme de la creme and ice dancing is kind 
[00:30:30]  of the, the freestyle version, you know?  Right.  If you're Canadian and you turn on the TV and there's a dude wearing feathers on ice, turn  the fucking channel.  Yeah.  Cause it's all about hockey up there.  Yeah.  I can't argue that figure skating is the number one Olympic sport to watch, but I bought Olympic  hockey over, over ice dancing.  And to the other guy that was just on saying that, you know, they got a lot of good young  people and in Canada, they're right in USA as the number one team to beat. 
[00:31:00]  I mean, you look at Kane from Chicago and they've got a good lock, a lot of hockey players up  there and they went in thinking, you know, uh, we got nothing to lose.  We're going to play it all out.  And they, you know, they played all out.  They played like we used to call up here, fire wagon hockey.  They, they were going for it.  It was unbelievable.  Yeah.  And the other thing was, you're right.  When you go back to watching a game between Columbus and Nashville next week, you're going  to vomit and say, what happened? 
[00:31:30]  Well, especially because I'm an Islanders fan.  I mean, we're, I think, uh, six points out of the playoff spot now.  And how do I, how do I go back to watching the Islanders?  You'll be all right.  You've got Tavares.  You'll get a lot of good draft picks this year.  You'll draft well.  You'll be a good team in the future.  I mean, you, you saw how, how exciting hockey can be.  I think the NHL needs to, I don't know, cut their season in half or something.  Make it, make, uh, every game mean a little more important.  And then, uh, then you would see, I think a lot more action.  Did you see a last night with Batman went up in the crowd to, uh, kiss ass with the chair 
[00:32:00]  of the international ice hockey federation?  I honestly missed that.  I must've went to NBC to look at ice dancing.  They're taking the stand that the NHL shouldn't be there because they're not getting any money out  of it.  Right.  And, uh, and he was up there saying, uh-oh, this is real hockey.  I better go up and suck that guy's dick for a while.  Yeah.  The NHL looks a little weird, uh, this morning.  I'm thinking.  Yeah.  Cause you saw a great game last night.  Well, hopefully they, they still got a back door into Anthony's questions.  This is just a round robin. 
[00:32:30]  And then they go into place in Canada's six right now.  So all USA is going to buy to the quarterfinals.  Canada's going to play Germany.  Then they get Russia.  And if they beat Russia in the quarters, they could eventually meet USA for the gold medal game.  And that would be unbelievable.  That would be huge.  I would fucking love to see that.  That'd be huge.  I would love to see that.  I'd watch that one.  Oh, yeah.  Thanks for having me today.  Hope, I'm punching out.  All right.  Thank you, sir.  Let's go to Matt in Toronto.  Matt.  Hey, guys.  The country is in mourning.  But let's clarify something.  The U.S. did not beat Canada last night playing men's ice hockey. 
[00:33:00]  Ryan Miller 100% single-handedly beat the Canadian hockey team.  Oh, here we go.  He's a second holder in Buffalo.  Right.  And I've said from the start, Ryan Miller can easily single-handedly win this tournament for the U.S.  And he did exactly that last night.  And this is just, it's a nightmare.  I've got tickets to the second semifinal game, the bronze medal game, and the gold hockey game.  And if for some reason, touch wood, please, God, Canada's not there, that trip across Canada for me just doesn't seem like it's worth it anymore. 
[00:33:30]  Yeah, I can't argue with you.  Ryan Miller had just an amazing game last night.  He was standing on his head, I hear.  Anthony, he certainly was.  The game was so unbelievable.  What did the announcers say at the end of the third period?  I mean, there was one point where it was just, the action was so ridiculous that I thought these guys were going to lose their voices.  Just screaming.  And then at one point, I think one of the guys yelled out, this is tremendously tremendous.  Was that the quote? 
[00:34:00]  Anyone remember?  Travis?  I don't remember.  I just remember that this one period of, it felt like forever, where just Canada was just shooting the puck nonstop.  There was no stoppage of play in the NHL.  They stopped the play every 30 seconds, it seems.  I don't know what was different about this.  I know why.  They were barely calling any penalties.  Maybe E-Rock was in the crowd.  Is that why you said that?  Tremendously tremendous.  Let's go to Jerry.  Yes, wait a minute.  I was watching the game.  Jerry! 
[00:34:30]  Hello.  Hello, Jerry.  What's up?  Hey, how you doing?  Good.  I just want, the last, I think it was the last two guys from Canada that you talked to, pretty much summed it up.  The last guy in particular, we didn't beat ourselves.  We got out goaltended last night at the bottom line of the whole game.  Our team did play better as far as getting the puck down the ice, number of shots on net, all that good shit.  But the goaltending was the difference in the game.  Ryan Miller did indeed stand on his head. 
[00:35:00]  That's the end of that.  All right.  Thank you.  I mean, they're still calling.  I mean, you want a few more of these?  I like hearing the Canadians all dejected and shit.  Not many Canadians calling today.  He was bashing Canada.  It was tough to find two Canadians calling our show this morning.  In the spirit of sports.  Usually they call a lot early in the morning, but not today.  Yeah, they're very drunk and hungover.  Matt in Connecticut.  Hey, boys.  I was watching Curling on Sunday on MSNBC. 
[00:35:30]  Flipped it over to NBC, and they were showing an infomercial on how to buy and sell stock options.  What the fuck are they doing?  Oh, Caleb, one more thing.  Well, I just want to let you know the old bit that I love that made a tremendous return last night was the things that the O&A show killed.  Anyone named Miller, I just went, Miller.  Miller.  Miller.  Miller.  Some other goalies we got.  Miller.  Miller with another save.  Miller standing on his head. 
[00:36:00]  Miller.  Miller.  Yeah.  All right.  Well, we can continue talking about this.  We got to get into other things.  Poor bastards.  That fucking curling.  Enough of that goddamn curling.  I don't know.  Anytime.  Like, if I'm passing by it, I got to stop and kind of look and go, let me see how this one went.  And is Andy Levy into curling or not?  Because on Twitter, he's watching every curling match.  But I don't know if he's being sarcastic or if he's really into this fucking curling thing.  You never know with him.  I don't know.  He's on Twitter, and he talks about these games like he's really into it. 
[00:36:30]  I'm not sure.  I think he is, though.  I'm done with it.  Are you?  Yeah.  They show curling all day long on MSNBC.  Enough with the curling.  It is very overexposed, the curling.  I think it is.  Thank God we won't see it for another four years.  I really believe it is.  Let's say hi to Matt on Long Island.  Matt.  Matt.  Hey, what's going on, One?  Hey, Matt.  Martin Brodeau's stick with the USA.  The guy said that every time he beats a country, he writes it on his stick.  And that stick he used to beat the USA last time he played it. 
[00:37:00]  Oh, that's why USA was on the stick.  What's up with that?  All right.  I got to call Opie out on one thing.  At the beginning of the show, he said he was a little kid when that thing happened with Hague.  We were in college, bro.  I was a little kid.  Get a CEO, class of 84, baby.  I was there with you.  Ha, ha, ha, little kid.  Yeah, prove it.  I'm in control here at the White House. 
[00:37:30]  No, man, I was in high school when Reagan got shot, for real.  I really was.  Let me say hi to Derek in Toronto.  Derek, look at this fucking...  Hold on a minute.  It is so stupid.  And you know what?  And they're dressed like natives.  And we're skating.  I've seen more ice dancing highlights this morning than fucking US-Canada Olympic hockey highlights.  That's all you'll see.  And that's what NBC's going to argue?  Well, this is more popular, really?  Of course.  Then I don't want to be part of this fucking country. 
[00:38:00]  Look at these.  What is that?  They're ice dancing.  What is Jimmy Fallon doing on the ice?  What is that?  Looking like a fembot.  What is that?  They really are fruits.  What is that about?  What's the matter with your hip, Danny?  A couple of games of bowling, and Danny's all chewed up.  You guys went bowling all the weekend?  A little bowling.  Can we talk about that after the break?  A little bowling field trip.  Nothing much to talk about.  It's just a couple of aches and pains. 
[00:38:30]  Nah, you'll have some time on bowling.  Yeah, having some fun.  Oh, you know what?  I did mention curling, and I did set this up with Anthony, so now I'm going to show you  something.  Ah.  Somebody fucking tweeted me this goddamn picture over the weekend.  I want a big picture of it.  Trust me.  Let me do it this way first.  The linky.  I want Danny to blow the surprise here.  So this girl, I don't even know her name, because this article I got from somebody, it's in  a foreign language.  I think she's, who does she play for? 
[00:39:00]  Denmark or something?  I don't know.  Curling broad.  She's got blonde hair, really nice eyes, nice body.  Yeah.  And, uh, and ready for this, Ant?  That's her.  That's her curling.  That's her curling.  She's to push the fucking stone rock girl?  Yeah, she's sliding the stone down the ice toward the house.  Toward the house, right.  Trying to get close to the button, depending on what the other fucking stones are doing  on the goddamn ice.  I don't know.  It's shuffleboard. 
[00:39:30]  It's fucking shuffleboard.  Wiggle your stone so you can get it into the house.  Whatever.  All right, ready for this, Ant?  Yeah.  This is the same broad.  Oh, shit.  Hey, hey, hey.  Let me see that.  What I'm showing Ant is this, this curling, derfor?  Derfor?  What an ass.  Uh, yeah, she, they show her curling, and then, uh, the shot right next to that is her  topless with side boob and a little, a little mole on her side boob. 
[00:40:00]  But she's got like.  And she has an unbelievable ass.  That ass is sweet.  Little frilly panties on.  Yeah.  She's not shy to get naked.  Wearing little frilly panties.  How great is that?  Oh, that's good.  I want to see it on the big screen.  How great is that?  You got to see it on the big screen.  Oh, Danny, I did a lot of tweeting last night.  You're going to have to go a couple pages in.  You're going to have to go down, huh?  Yeah, you're going to have to go a couple in.  You're going to have to keep tweeting before you get to the naked fucking curling chick. 
[00:40:30]  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  They did say tremendously, tremendous.  That was.  Tremendously, tremendous.  That's just like, do you believe in miracles?  Yeah.  He thought he was having a moment.  Go to the next page, Danny.  You'll find it.  Oh, you got it right there, right there, right there.  A little further down.  A little further down.  You're right about there.  Right there.  For Anthony.  All right.  It's on my Twitter.  You're going to have to dig for it, though.  It's deep at this point. 
[00:41:00]  Deep, deep.  I dig.  Basically, I wrote something like, for everyone that doesn't like curling, click on this picture now.  I've seen her before.  Yeah, there it is.  The picture to the right.  Slide that over for Anthony.  Oh, yeah.  She did a little topless modeling.  She's got a nice ass on her.  Unbelievable ass.  Boy, look at the focus.  See, it doesn't always have to be about the big boobs, right?  No, not at all.  That's a nice size right there.  A nice full B.  That's perfect.  A nice full B.  Nice eights.  That's fantastically fantastic, I'd like to say. 
[00:41:30]  She's standing on her head.  Would you like to take your hammer and wiggle your stone into her butt?  Wiggle the stone right into her butt.  I'll grab my cock like a broom.  Just rub it.  And Kevin from Connecticut just writes, NBC sucks turtle clit.  Wow.  It's got to be hard to even find.  And Kevin was yelling at me because I didn't turn my avatar into an American flag last night.  I didn't even know how to do that.  Your what? 
[00:42:00]  My picture on my Twitter.  Like last night.  Change it into something else?  Yeah, like an American flag.  Everyone was doing that for the USA last night.  Oh, sorry.  Because I didn't do it.  Kevin was yelling on the screen at me.  The fact is, I didn't know how to fucking do it.  Let's say hi to Scott in Grand Rapids.  Scott.  Hey, what's up, fellas?  Hey, man.  Hey, you need to check out the British ice dancing couple.  They're brother and sister.  The British ice dancing is brother and sister. 
[00:42:30]  Oh, well.  Yeah.  The last name is Kerr.  K-E-R-R.  Yeah.  And what do they do?  Do they make it look like they're loving each other and shit?  Oh, you should watch the set.  I watched it with my wife last night and you should see it.  That's the creepy part.  It's like they got to make it look like they're almost kissing and he's skipping her and doing  things and it's like, all right.  Yeah, that's great.  I believe they ended.  He was straddling her.  Hot. 
[00:43:00]  All right.  All right, boys.  Punch it out.  Thank you, Scott.  You know what I don't understand is like the rest of the world has really hot curling broads.  Yeah.  Except for the one woman on, wow, I've watched curling way too much.  There's one broad on Jeremy's team that's brutal.  Just a man?  For real.  She's more manly than just about all of us that work for this show.  But the United States have very frumpy curling chicks.  Yeah, yeah.  We don't have hot curling girls.  Like this girl, yes.  What is she? 
[00:43:30]  She has blonde hair, but she has the dye black hair.  Oh, right, right, right.  Yeah, yeah.  Who does she play for?  Because she was smoking too.  England?  Uh, I don't know.  Do you know her name, Danny?  People have been watching the covers.  They know exactly who.  She's got the hair like the girl from, uh, that's singing the No More Words video.  Sure.  Looks British.  I gotta get her name.  Wait, and the German broad was right to her right on that Google image page, but whatever.  Oh, I see that. 
[00:44:00]  Yeah, it looks like UK, right?  Yeah, some...  Eve.  Yeah, Eve Mulehead.  Mulehead.  Mulehead.  Mulehead.  Mulehead.  That's a great name to have.  No kidding.  Eve Morehead.  It's pretty much Eve Morehead.  Eve Morehead has the hammer.  Let's see.  Eve Morehead.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  See, some of the pictures of her don't look very good, but other ones...  What are you kidding? 
[00:44:30]  Well...  I think she's hotter than...  Is that the one that Rapey Kit sent me?  I'm not sure.  Eve Mulehead.  Because she looks hotter in these pictures.  Oh, okay.  Well, you fucked up.  You sent me a shitty picture.  These are...  The one we looked at right from the Google images where she had the black and the blonde  hair.  That looked pretty hot.  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Okay.  She's got really nice eyes.  Yeah.  Ridiculous eyes.  It's all about the eyes.  How did she get into curling, by the way? 
[00:45:00]  How did that girl get into curling?  I don't know.  She's in school.  What?  Someone goes, hey, we got this curling sport.  What do you think?  Oh, hell, dude.  Oh, yeah.  You fucking ticked a curling brock.  You see our skipper on the men's team?  No.  He's a bartender when he's not curling.  Is he really?  Yes.  Like, they really don't...  No offense to the bartenders out there.  That's hysterical, but, you know, bartending to Olympics, just...  He looks like E-Rock.  He's a little chubby.  He has a little hat on.  Aw.  And he's our skipper.  Adorable.  Our skipper. 
[00:45:30]  I think they call him skippers.  Oh, is he the guy that...  No, he's not the guy that fucked up, is he?  Yeah, he fucked up.  Yeah, he fucked up.  Yeah, he's been fucking up a lot.  And they're yelling and screaming at him.  They're calling him, like, Bill Buckner and stuff.  Yeah, yeah.  And the announcer's like, you gotta relax.  This guy, he's a bartender when he's not curling.  Well, then maybe we should have a better skipper than the bartender guy.  He's not an athlete making millions and millions of dollars a year.  He bartends when he's not curling.  He's cheesed so many times, though.  You see him make these fucking clutch shots and he fucks them up. 
[00:46:00]  Yeah.  Oh, the Olympics.  What a big Winter Olympics, though, this time around.  It's pretty good.  People really seem to give a shit.  It's pretty fucking good.  Why don't we take a break, Dan?  We'll get into some other things.  Yeah.  I'm in charge here.  We gotta do the Tiger Woods.  Oh, yeah.  His big speech was on Friday.  Wow, just captivated.  I'm gonna ask you what you thought of it after the break.  My thoughts. 
[00:46:30]  My thoughts.  Your thoughts on the Tiger Woods apology thing.  I don't know what I saw.  I don't know what I saw.  We'll discuss that next.  We'll discuss Olympic hockey a little more.  The Olympics in general.  And Anthony Bowling over the weekend.  Yeah, just a little fun.  What else?  Joe Rogan's coming in Friday?  Rogan.  That's good.  That's real good.  I like to Rogan.  And other stuff.  Stay there, Opie and Anthony.  Boy, this has been tremendously, tremendous.  Yeah, we're watching Ice Dancing Highlights. 
[00:47:00]  Oh, my God.  Unbelievable.  It's so flaming.  It's just so flaming.  Bye-bye.  One other thought on the game last night.  I want to hear from, like, Crosby fans. 
[00:47:30]  You know, Sidney Crosby.  Yeah.  Who plays for the Penguins.  NBC live from Cross Mountain.  Why does Al Roker have to be up there?  Because it's NBC, so they bring all their stars to get some coverage.  He's useless.  He is useless.  Of course he is.  And Brodeur.  A lot of Brodeur fans out there.  Brodeur.  But this is what I want to hear from some of these people maybe later in the show, because 
[00:48:00]  we're going to move on to other things.  Like, you're a huge Sidney Crosby fan, or a huge Brodeur fan, but they're playing for  Canada.  Yeah.  Like, how do you handle that?  You know what I mean?  You've got to go with your country.  Well, a lot of people on Twitter are saying, this is really weird, because I'm a huge Crosby  fan, but I'm rooting against him, because I'm going for the U.S. team.  Got to go with your country.  Of course, but you know what I'm saying, though? 
[00:48:30]  Yeah.  You know, you're a hardcore Crosby fan, but you're rooting against him in the Olympics.  That's got to be a little strange.  Boo to him.  Boo.  So how was your weekend?  Bowling?  Yeah, pretty good.  And, you know, Friday was, got to get home, you know, and I said, I'm meeting with the  trainer.  Ah.  Meeting with the trainer.  Got to get back into some type of shape.  You know?  Some type of shape.  It's getting harder and harder.  You know what it is?  It is just a lot of goddamn work. 
[00:49:00]  You know, no one sucks about getting older.  I've got to start admitting I'm older than 26.  Well, you were a kid when Al Haig, apparently, said he was in charge.  Fucking asshole blowing up my spot.  You were a kid.  Good Geneseo asshole.  You take one day off from working out.  It's like, all of a sudden, you lose everything.  You can't.  Yeah, you can't.  I was doing very well up until, like, my big breakup. 
[00:49:30]  And then I just decided, you know.  Fuck it all.  Literally, fuck it all.  I just decided, you know, I'm going to take a day off here and that.  And then once you start doing that, it's just over, Johnny.  Of course.  And then this past holiday season, just eating like a fucking pig.  We all did.  And I know.  But then I just started looking and going, ah, what am I doing? 
[00:50:00]  Oh, you're talking about Groundhog's Day.  Oh, yeah.  You were eating like a pig.  Yes, exactly.  Oh, I thought you meant Christmas.  Is it Groundhog's Day or Groundhog's Day?  I think it's Groundhog's Day.  It is, right?  Yeah, because there's a few of them.  But now I met with the trainer and I got to get some reasonable equipment.  I'm not going to, you know, go crazy.  And then, of course, everybody's like, well, new coat rack, new this, new that.  Oh, you got a Bowflex?  No, I don't have a Bowflex.  No Bowflex.  Did you get that whack-off stick? 
[00:50:30]  I didn't get the whack-off stick.  The shake-stick?  The shake-stick that looks like you're just jacking off.  I didn't get the numerous workout DVDs for dancing.  You know, it's supposed to get your abs in shape if you dance.  Get the fuck out of here.  Now, this guy seems to know what's going on and what I need and shit like that.  Is he in shape at least?  Yeah, yeah.  That would suck if you go there and the guy's like not in shape.  At my gym, you know, there's a bunch of trainers there and they're training people and they're fucking frumps. 
[00:51:00]  Yeah.  I mean, don't you want your trainer to look like he doesn't have an ounce of fat on him?  Yeah, not a good sign if they're fat.  Not a good sign.  They're fat.  I'm like, you're going to teach me?  You're going to get me in shape?  You can't even get yourself in shape.  So, you know, you go over your goals and things that you want to accomplish and shit like that.  And then, you know, they're looking into what equipment I need in the exercise room.  And then, you know, I get started. 
[00:51:30]  And then I go and get, I got the doctor's appointment.  So, I go for a complete physical.  And then fucking blast it out and get back where I was.  You're getting back on the rails?  Yeah.  I got to get back on the rails.  There are pants that I put on in the morning and then just leave on the closet floor.  I'm like, I go, nope, nope, nope.  Can't fit into that one anymore.  Those are gone.  And then I just, like, leave them on the floor. 
[00:52:00]  And then they end up still being hung up.  And I forget which one or two I actually fit in now.  It's just terrible.  Bring them in.  The guys enjoy a...  Fuck that.  I'm getting back into...  The guys enjoy pants from the hosts.  I'm getting back into my 32s.  I ain't even fucking dealing with that shit.  32s?  33.  Three an hour.  35, 30...  No, I swear.  It's like 30.  I was down like 32.  Damn. 
[00:52:30]  And then...  Did you actually work out, though?  Or you guys are still just talking about how you need this equipment and you're going to do these exercises?  No, it was the first meeting.  But did you at least lift something?  No.  I don't have anything to really lift.  I would fire that trainer.  All I have is cardio stuff.  If it was a real trainer, they would have said, you know what?  Enough of this talking about it and setting your goals.  We're going to run up and down your stairs a few times.  You can't do that.  That's what real trainers do.  They don't talk about goals.  No, they don't. 
[00:53:00]  This is a personal trainer.  Day one.  Comes to your house.  You got to first, you know...  Really?  Figure out what...  They hit the fucking point blank there.  Janine, thanks.  They talked about it, then had a few Guinness.  Exactly.  Exactly.  We did some power lifting with the Guinness pints in each hand.  That trainer would have improvised and had you outside shoveling your driveway.  Something going, okay, we're going to start working out now.  Like fucking old school...  Rocky.  Rocky.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Taking it back. 
[00:53:30]  Instead of discussing, well, we can't work out because you don't have equipment yet,  so let's discuss the equipment you need for your gym.  You did nothing.  No, I know.  That's what...  It was a meeting.  On Friday, right?  Yeah.  And now it's Monday.  It was just a meeting.  That's three days ago.  Did you...  Did he...  Oh, not...  Yesterday, I did not...  I did not leave the horizontal position yesterday.  I was completely...  I just pretty much stayed in bed.  Watched TV. 
[00:54:00]  I did nothing.  No, I need the proper equipment.  There are forms that have to be filled out.  Doctor things.  When will you...  You just gotta...  When will you do your first sit-up?  Probably July, August.  Right.  Who is this guy?  I'm thinking July, August.  I think you're getting ripped off.  No, I'm going to be...  Not at all.  I am going to be ripped.  Ripped by the summer.  That's right.  Okay.  Although, we did, like I said earlier, go bowling then Saturday.  Friday, and it feels like somebody twisted my arm around five times, and then let it go 
[00:54:30]  and just spin back, and...  Where's it hurt?  Your shoulder?  Your elbow, probably?  Yeah, the wrist.  Not really the elbow.  The wrist, the bowling thumb, where you get that bowling thumb, and the shoulder, and  then, of course, the groin area.  Like, not the cock.  I wasn't bowling with my dick or anything.  But that thigh, that inner thigh area, where if you stretch and pull it out, you really 
[00:55:00]  kind of feel it.  Sure.  Uncle Wiggly over here, poor Grandpa Danny, is actually limping around the studio.  I told Keith yesterday that...  Like, he got shot.  I was in embarrassing pain.  Because, like, four games of bowling should not feel like this to a 29-year-old.  And, like, my hip is so sore.  Like, I'm on my fourth Advil already, and I'm in crazy amounts of pain.  You might need hip replacement surgery. 
[00:55:30]  You need an Anacin.  I do.  I wish we had some Anacin.  Take some Anacin.  What's wrong with you guys?  It's bowling.  It was so...  You know what it is?  Because when you go bowling, you don't think about, like, all right, I'm going to stretch  and warm up.  I'm going to do this.  You start drinking beer, you change your shoes, and you hurl 16 pounds, like, over  and over again with no warm-up, no consideration to your muscles or anything.  And then as you go along, of course, you're having some more beer, so you just figure you're 
[00:56:00]  throwing it harder.  You're trying to get that ball up over your head before you release.  And then you wake up and go, what the fuck did I do?  Oh, that's right.  That was bowling.  And, again, took a cab.  Oh, good.  Took a cab both ways.  And thank God, because...  And I didn't mention this to Danny, either, because you had cut out before I even went  downstairs on Saturday.  Do you know how thankful I am that we decided, mid-trip from bowling alley to home, to not 
[00:56:30]  go to the strip club?  Oh, really?  Yeah.  Because that was a good idea.  Oh, do you remember?  We were going to go.  We were going to go, yeah.  We were going to go.  And then it was just like common sense kicked in and said, you know something?  I looked at the watch.  Why is that a good thing that you didn't go there?  I'm confused.  Because it was already 2.30 in the morning or something, right?  Yeah, it was pretty early.  2.30?  Yeah.  And it would have been a fucking drunken disaster. 
[00:57:00]  But it sounds like it already was.  No, it was okay.  But that would have put it over the top where I would have been still hungover right now.  And Ann, I would normally agree with you, but I, like yourself, grew up on Long Island.  Yeah.  I miss Long Island.  I would love to go back there.  Yes.  But I think you're safer drinking and driving.  Yeah.  It's going to be an outrageous statement.  I understand.  You're safer drinking and driving than taking one of those fucking cab rides on Long Island. 
[00:57:30]  You think?  What lunatic did you have this time?  I don't know.  They were both regular kind of guys.  Regular?  They're lunatics.  Yeah, they are a little crazy.  Yes.  But I think you're safer, really, drinking and driving.  Just drinking and driving?  So you suggest I don't take a cab and I just hop in the old Escalade?  Well, that's the other reason why you're safer, because at that hour of the night, what,  2.30, 3 o'clock in the morning?  Yeah.  It's nothing but drunks on the road anyway, and you've got crazy fucking cab driver guy 
[00:58:00]  in a vehicle that if they do get into any kind of altercation, you're not going to fare  too well.  But in your Escalade, you've got all that nice...  It's nothing about...  All those airbags and...  Dude, let me tell you something.  Listen, the drinking and driving, and not drinking and driving, and taking a cab instead  of the Escalade, has nothing to do with accidents.  It has nothing to do with getting into an accident.  I do not want a Dewey.  I've reached the point where it's like, I really don't want to get a Dewey. 
[00:58:30]  And not that I ever did want to get one.  And knock fucking wood, I'm not even going to say it, but knock wood, I've been a lucky  man.  It's all about just not getting a Dewey.  So we call...  And as a matter of fact, we were fucking hitting the breathalyzer at my bar before we had left.  I think we were fucking...  We would have been intoxicated.  It's so nice to hear that on the day you met... 
[00:59:00]  The day after you met your trainer...  Well...  You're blowing...  What do you blow?  Well, I only blew a...  I thought you were turning over a new...  What did I get, 08, 09?  Yeah, I think we were legally fucked before we left the house.  We were technically legally.  I could have talked, you know.  But the breathalyzer said that we were a little over.  You were just saying how you're trying to get everything back on track, back on the  rails.  Once I start working out, it's over, Johnny.  When's that first fucking sit-up, though? 
[00:59:30]  It's going to be sometime around mid-summer.  Maybe early fall.  Back to the breathalyzer real quick.  You know, because you're supposed to wait like 15 minutes, you know, before you blow  into it without having to drink.  So just for shits and giggles, like I just kind of swished around with some beer and I  blew like a three.  A three?  And then I wanted to try to...  It took like 15 minutes to reset.  Because it calibrates and it was taking too long and I was just like, yeah, you know,  for most people, this isn't a party toy.  Yeah, of course.  I know, it's not supposed to be a party toy. 
[01:00:00]  We're just sitting there drinking and bringing it into a breathalyzer.  So, hey, look at this, it's pretty fucked up.  I miss the bars that had the breathalyzer right at the bar.  Oh, at the bar where you pulled a little straw out.  And supposedly it was for, you know, to make sure you weren't drunk, but everyone used  it to see who could get the drunkest.  It backfired on all those bars.  I beat you.  Steven asks from Bayshore, every cab driver on Long Island tells me his entire lunatic  life story and the time it takes to get from Bayshore to the Babylon train station,  which isn't a long ride at all.  I never asked for it and I'm always relieved to finally get out of the cab and away from 
[01:00:30]  that chattering loon.  It is true.  They're a totally different animal than city cab drivers.  They're crazy like Long Island white guys that just, poof, meth heads.  Yeah, they just, meth heads that just won't shut up.  Especially the night shift guys.  They're even crazier.  I'm telling you, I think you're safer, like, chancing the D-Way.  No, I don't, I can't be involved in any criminal activity.  I understand.  Steven asks from Bayshore, oh no, no, no, I'm sorry, I read yours already. 
[01:01:00]  This guy goes, oh, Sean, Sean in North Carolina.  Ripped by summer, Anthony?  Don't you get ripped every weekend?  I don't mean ripped like that.  And then Bruce in Ontario, the only thing ripped by the summer is Ant's pants.  Shut up!  I'm not even close to fat, you fuck.  Yeah, but you brought a trainer to your house and the fucking guy didn't give you, didn't  do anything.  He wasn't there to start a workout right then and there. 
[01:01:30]  He should have said, where's your sneakers?  Go get your sneakers.  And then you should have jogged around the block or something.  No, it had nothing to do with that.  It was about filling out some paperwork and getting kind of, you know, a rapport going.  Get to know each other?  Him knowing what I want out of this, what I want to get out of this whole thing.  The equipment that I have, equipment that I need.  He should have thrown you right into boot camp.  No.  It's a boot camp right around your neighborhood.  I got to get some weights.  He should have had some kind of army shirt. 
[01:02:00]  You put one on, he puts one on.  Yeah, he starts yelling at me like a drill instructor.  Right, he's got a whistle and fatigue's on.  Let me tell you something!  This isn't going to be fun!  I'm not here for shits and giggles!  Girls, can you at least let the show know when you do your first sit-up?  Oh, yeah.  It's going to be very soon.  Soon?  Believe me, yeah, yeah.  Sometime this week?  Well, probably not this week.  I'm very busy.  I have a premiere to go to tonight, and then I have red eye on Thursday.  See?  Ha, ha, ha!  No! 
[01:02:30]  So, it's safe to say, a week after getting the trainer, you're still not going to be  working out.  I'm having the gym totally done.  I'm getting new equipment.  I'm getting weights.  You know those weights that they click in to the...  Oh, yeah, those are awesome.  I'm getting that whole set, dude.  Yeah!  And then what?  I'm lifting, motherfucker.  The bench, I'll be on there.  Hoo, hoo, hoo!  And then a treadmill, and then probably some other kind of cardio machine.  Make sure you're cleaning, ladies.  And then the wall pulley things. 
[01:03:00]  Yeah, but make sure you're cleaning, ladies.  Like, dust off all your equipment every week so it looks like they're being used.  All right, asshole.  All right.  Look.  I know.  It's going to look like when we did cribs at Pat from Wunaki's house.  Ha, ha, that exercise!  It was like a bench that, like, there was, there was, like, something resting on top of  it, and I took it off, and, like, you could tell that it had been resting there for  years.  Years?  Years.  Because, like, the foam was dead in the pad.  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.  I'm just saying. 
[01:03:30]  I think, I think it's nice.  I just, I'm excited for you.  It's, it's, it's going to work out very well.  I know it.  I'm back into it.  Got to get back into it.  Well, you're not back into it yet.  Well, I'm saying, I got to get back into it.  You're thinking about getting back into it.  It's that first, you know, first step.  Got the, the trainer.  Going to start training, Ope.  I hear you.  That's how it works.  Uh, let's say hi to Brian in Jersey.  Brian.  Brian.  Yeah, so I just wanted to know if the trainer was about Anthony to do some lessons. 
[01:04:00]  It's aqueducts.  My aqueducts.  Shut up.  People don't like my columns.  They think I'm holding up water aqueducts from Rome on the second floor.  Your columns are pretty impressive.  The columns are there to hold up joists.  Very impressive.  I mean, that's how I keep my giant open space.  Uh, let's go to Dan in D.C.  Dan.  Hey, guys.  What's going on?  Hey, man.  Hey, I wanted to talk to you about the, uh, the comment you guys said about Sidney Crosby.  Oh, basically, yeah, just to set it up again, a lot of people are rooting against Crosby because 
[01:04:30]  they're going for, you know, the U.S.  Stills Nash and Young.  Oh, sorry.  Which is weird because there's a lot of hardcore Crosby fans out there that have to go against  their boy.  Yeah.  How is that?  Is that weird, Dan?  Well, with me, I'll tell you, I'll explain it with me.  Um, I'm a Pittsburgh Penguins fan, like a huge Penguins fan.  So if Crosby were to leave, then I couldn't root for him.  So it's kind of the same thing.  I'm a, I live in the U.S., so, you know, Crosby's a candidate. 
[01:05:00]  He's the enemy.  So, kind of the same situation.  But, you know, I guess, um, I, I, whenever Marc-Andre Fleury, he, I like him more than  Crosby.  He's the goalie for the Penguins, and he was the backup goalie for Canada.  So, for me, it was kind of more to not root against him.  Right.  Because I like him more.  You know what I mean?  So, it's just...  And it's the same thing with Malkin, Evgeny Malkin.  He's a, he's, he's playing for Russia, you know, so now I got to root against him. 
[01:05:30]  And he's my favorite player for the Penguins.  That's got to be just strange.  It is kind of weird.  Like, it's kind of awkward or root against a guy that I, you know, I love to see play.  And I think he's a great, great player.  I think he's better than Ovechkin.  Right.  And I'm saying it, and I live in Washington, D.C.  So, anybody D.C. fans listening, Crosby is better than Ovechkin.  I'm saying it.  So, I'm saying it.  He's saying it.  I'm saying it.  He doesn't have a microphone.  It's not true. 
[01:06:00]  That's a brave statement, sir.  Brave statement.  That's what everyone's talking about.  As far as hockey goes, who's better, Ovechkin or Crosby?  I'm more of a...  We'll see how many fans come out, but they're all fan-wagging fans anyway.  Capitals fans.  All right, Dan.  Thank you, sir.  I appreciate it.  People want to talk about Anthony's gym thing.  Oh.  Let's go to Larry in Virginia.  Virginia.  I'm in charge here in Virginia.  Yes, Larry. 
[01:06:30]  What's up, Larry?  Morning, boys.  Hey.  Yeah, I just wanted to tell you, you know, I bought a gym, all that crap, and it got all dusty.  I didn't do anything, and I bought that P90X system off the TV and commercial.  Yeah.  I lost 38 pounds in 90 days, and I am totally ripped.  I was 208.  I'm 170 now, and I wouldn't waste my money on that gym crap.  The only thing I ever use in my gym anymore is the elliptical machine, and they call it muscle crap. 
[01:07:00]  You sound like a salesman.  You sound like you're trying to bamboozle me.  What are you, a truly salesman?  No, no.  Don't get that gym.  I got that.  You got an elliptical machine, Ed?  Huh?  You got the, what is it, elliptical?  No, I want to get like either a Stairmaster or an elliptical, but I think it's Stairmaster,  because I got a treadmill, which is pretty good, and that gives me the running thing,  but that Stairmaster, man, that fucking kicks your ass. 
[01:07:30]  But the elliptical is great, because you're using your arms and legs, and it's easier on our old man knees.  Well, I'd rather just do the arms, you know, with the weights and stuff.  I understand.  I guarantee you, if you buy this P90X, and you do it, it's not all the time, it's an hour  a day.  All right.  P90X.  No, I got, I got, I got, the thing is, I understand, if you buy shit, and, all right, well, you just  talk.  All right, I'll get rid of him so you can talk ahead.  If you buy, if you buy shit, and then it just collects dust, then, then it doesn't matter. 
[01:08:00]  But, that's, see, hence, the guy that comes over and kicks your ass, uh, three times a week.  Oh, that's what he's doing.  Yeah.  Oh, so he's.  Well, not yet.  But, uh, when?  When?  Well, I'm thinking, all right, look.  When's your next, when's your next appointment with this guy?  Look, I'm very, I'm very busy.  When?  Uh, in the upcoming, um, so your trainer came over last Friday, and you still haven't  done anything.  When does he come over again so you do more of nothing?  Uh, he comes over, he comes over again with, um, the, uh, equipment, the list of equipment 
[01:08:30]  that I will be getting.  Uh, and then it must be installed.  And then, I will start, uh, doing it.  But if he's a trainer, you could be doing other things.  How about a little walk around the neighborhood as you discuss what you're going to do eventually?  I do that, but it's just a matter of, you know what it is?  Come on.  It's a matter of, I need to go, and, and first of all, I want to get a complete physical done.  So I have the appointment for that, which is, uh, set for, uh, um, I believe, um, the 
[01:09:00]  day after Halloween.  I should be, uh, getting that.  No, I got, I got that whole thing, uh, set.  So, um.  So baby steps.  I want to do, exactly.  Well, how about you do some baby steps?  Actual baby steps.  I do.  Do you, do you know how many times I'm running up and down that, those stairs to get to the  bar and then back up to the living room in time for forensic files?  Uh, this guy writes, if the groundhog doesn't see a shadow, it will be another four weeks  without sit-ups for air. 
[01:09:30]  Shut up.  Look, I'm not in bad shape.  I'm just not, uh, toned.  I'm not saying you're in bad shape, but.  I'm talking to the, for the audience.  Oh.  I'm just, I'm very, I'm very out of, um, uh, tone.  You know?  I'm, I'm doughy.  Let's say hi to Joey.  Joey.  What's up, boys?  Hey.  Hey, man.  Hey, I, I would love to see a juiced up Anthony.  You know, just take juice until like August and you come in like a raging monster and everyone 
[01:10:00]  wouldn't know who the fuck you are.  Yeah, why don't you do like a, why don't you, yeah.  I would literally.  Why don't you become a juice head?  I'd literally, literally run into people on the streets then in my vehicle.  I'd have roid rage.  I'd have roid rage and just be crashing into people.  Dude, become a juice head, then Snooki would love you.  Ah, is that it?  She loves juice heads.  Snooki is so fucking, I'm sorry.  Disgusting, right?  And I, I know she hears what we say.  Have we said it officially on our show?  But I don't find her fucking attractive.  She's disgusting.  Yeah.  She.  Egg, egg. 
[01:10:30]  She looks like that woman in Goodfellas when they're all together putting makeup on.  Oh, don't even tell me about what that woman said.  She, she looks like her.  Yes.  She is not attractive.  Oh, God.  What is that?  I don't know what it is.  It's a little like.  Hey, boys.  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Her head is shaped weird.  Yes, Joey.  Hey, Anthony can't walk around his neighborhood to get exercise because all the Jews would be  hurling rocks at him every time they see him.  The Jews do not hurl rocks at me. 
[01:11:00]  Yeah, but if they don't think I'm Palestinian.  But you know how great that is for a workout if he's walking around his neighborhood and  the Jews are throwing rocks at him?  I got a dodge rock, some bobbin' and weavin'.  Now you're doing some core.  Core exercises.  I'm bobbin' and weavin'.  Core.  Oh, Kenny.  Yes, Kenny.  I have the perfect solution for you.  All right.  Get yourself a Wii Fit on your big screen.  Yeah, you should be Wii Fitting.  I'm not going to Wii Fit.  I'm telling you, save your money.  A Wii shall not be in my house.  If you were Wii Bowling over the weekend, you wouldn't be as sore as you are today, my friend.  Well, that's it.  And it's just as much fun as the real thing. 
[01:11:30]  No pain, no gain.  Mm-hmm.  Let me say hi to Mike in Halifax.  Hey, yeah.  Anthony, I predicted by the third appointment with your trainer, you're going to have that  guy drinking beer all weekend long, fucking 14-year-olds and shooting guns at the range.  He's going to...  The trainer's going to be all out of shape.  Just hanging out and drinking.  That'll be it.  Bobby, do you think you could possibly pull Ryan Miller's dick out of my ass, please? 
[01:12:00]  Oh.  Yeah, that was...  I'm sorry for you, sir.  I hear he was standing on his head.  He was absolutely standing on his head last night.  All I can say is I'm very proud to be an American now.  I don't know anything aboot Canada anymore.  Aboot.  Aboot.  Thank you, sir.  Bye.  Let me say hi to Bill in Jersey.  Bill.  Hello, Bill.  What's happening, fellas?  Hey, man.  And I wonder if you're really going to lose the weight or are you going to have thin follicles  put in like your hair? 
[01:12:30]  It's not...  Shut up.  Are you having thin follicles put in?  No, they were...  They were follicles placed artistically in the direction that your hair grows.  No, I'm not trying to lose weight.  It's not a weight loss thing.  It's a get in shape thing.  It's not a...  You know, it's a redistribution.  Yeah, these guys...  I'm not going to gain or lose pounds one way or the other that much.  Thanks for putting carrot top pictures up, Danny. 
[01:13:00]  That's my incentive.  I'm going to put posters of carrot top all over my house.  You can put like bicep implants in.  Yeah, I think the people need to know that we're the thinnest guys in radio.  Exactly.  You're listening to the thinnest guys in radio.  We are the thinnest guys in radio.  It's not about losing weight.  It's just trying to stay in shape.  Let's say hi to...  Carrot top isn't doing roids.  I'm fucking...  I think we asked him.  He said no.  I know.  Who says yes?  True.  No one says yes.  Can one guy admit they do steroids?  Just go yes, I do roids and get it over with. 
[01:13:30]  Candice.  Hey, what's up?  West Palm Beach, Florida.  Nice.  Yes, sir.  I wanted to just kind of point out to the fact that it sounded more like a date than  a meeting.  You got to know him.  You went over what you were looking for.  You talked about equipment.  You know...  Shut up.  It's not a date.  I've never heard of a trainer on day one not, like, doing something with their client.  It's...  You know, you can't just come into my house... 
[01:14:00]  I'm not saying run a marathon day one, but maybe go for a walk as you discuss things.  No, no, no.  It's not about...  It's not...  First of all, it's not about the trainer coming over and me going out into fucking 25 degree  weather and walking.  No.  That shan't happen.  I will train in comfort.  It's not up to you if you hire a trainer.  He tells you what to do.  I'm not training for a boxing match.  He's the boss.  He's the boss.  I'm not going to chase a chicken or fucking run up... 
[01:14:30]  Bobby's...  Stairs.  Bobby Big Rager is going to defend you.  Bobby.  Is he?  Yes.  Long time, guys.  Hey.  Anthony, don't you get enough of a workout just goose-stepping around the house?  That is true.  It's very hard to goose-step.  What size pants do you say you wear?  30 flurf?  30 flurf.  Are you up to a 30 flurf?  I'm up to a 30 flurf.  Okay.  Hey, guys.  How's it going, guys?  All right, brother.  Yeah, what...  Didn't you buy a Bowflex?  Someone is asking me.  No, I never had a Bowflex.  All right.  So...  I had, like, a weight thing, but it was a piece of shite. 
[01:15:00]  And I think Big Kev has that now, and it's a coat rack.  Let's go to John in Jersey.  John?  Hey, guys.  I just wanted to know, if Anthony's spending all this money for the gym, why not get a  female trainer and make it worth your while instead of going gay?  Does that...  Going gay.  I was waiting.  Thank you.  There it is.  I was waiting for that.  Why did that take so long?  Because you've got to hold your muscles to make sure you get one more rep in.  Shut up.  It is... 
[01:15:30]  It's weird having a male trainer.  When I went through rehab for my shoulder, I had a female trainer, and it...  And having a female trainer definitely makes you work out harder.  Because in some weird fucking DNA level, you're trying to impress her.  Well, I mean, for the rubdown.  Oh, yeah.  You're having a rubdown.  You do know trainers rub you down after each session.  No, there's no rubdown.  You know something?  You guys are asshats.  Wait a minute, John.  There's nothing about a rubdown.  John, is there not a rubdown?  Yes, there is not a rubdown. 
[01:16:00]  Trainers are...  Listen, for an extra $20 more, it's a happy ending.  Yeah, they work it...  Trainers are supposed to work you out hard, and then they rub you down after the session.  I think it moved.  I'm not...  I'm not getting a rubdown from anybody after I work out.  When I was going to the gym...  Don't ever say, oh, I pulled a muscle when you're having a session, because that's not good.  Because then he's going to have to work that area.  Look.  It's all just going to be about getting in shape. 
[01:16:30]  Yeah.  Not bodybuilding.  Yeah, okay.  Not losing weight or things like this.  It's about getting in shape.  Getting the...  You know, getting back where I was when I was going to the gym.  Let's say hi to Eddie in Virginia.  Eddie?  Don't gay rubdowns.  Eddie?  Morning, boys.  Hey.  Weight loss, please.  Not about weight loss.  Hey, that's funny, though.  Come on.  You ass. 
[01:17:00]  Let's say hi to Eddie on Long Island.  Another Eddie.  Fuck.  And Eddie Twofer.  What's up, Eddie?  Hey, what's going on, man?  Hey, ma'am.  I just want to know something here.  Is there a two-for-one sale on a gay trainer for you and E-Rock?  Shut up.  Does E-Rock have a male trainer?  E-Rock didn't even have a trainer.  He had the guy that showed him around the gym the first day.  Are you sure?  Yeah, I remember.  Where's E-Rock?  Come on in here, E-Rock.  Wasn't he paying $1,200 for a trainer?  Yeah, he was paying something ridiculous, like $200 a sample or something. 
[01:17:30]  Yeah, I can't remember what it was.  Yeah, let me go to...  We're getting E-Rock in studio.  Steve in Detroit.  Steve.  Morning, boys.  Yes.  Ed, did you meet your trainer on eHarmony and Bianca over those multiple levels of compatibility  before you brought him over to the house?  On eHarmony.  You're a douchebag.  Very good.  Let's go to Larry King's check-in.  Larry...  Oh, Larry King.  Hi, Larry.  Anthony, how important is the exercise in the exercise routine? 
[01:18:00]  Apparently not very.  And then I can't get to these fast enough.  Nelson in Georgia.  Nelson.  Yeah, what's up, guys?  Yeah, I bet olive oil couldn't get on the ground and do 20 push-ups right now.  It's skinny ass.  Olive oil.  Oh, Nelson, what are you, big Mr. Fucking Man?  Shut up.  Oh, this is a very good question, Ant.  This happens a lot.  Joe at Oceanside.  Joe?  Hey, Ed, are you and the trainer going to have a nice hard workout and then get in their shower  together?  All right. 
[01:18:30]  Look, there will be no showering.  There will be no rub down.  There is going to be working out, just getting in shape, and that's it.  Well, this is very interesting from Brady in Virginia.  Brady?  Hey, guys.  Hey.  The only thing that's got a chance of getting ripped in Anthony's house is another 17-year-old  Hyman.  A fucking Orman.  You said ripped.  Orman.  Do you have a trainer?  Yes.  Oh, you have a trainer?  Does he touch your muscles when you have a real big workout and you're a little sore? 
[01:19:00]  No, she does not.  Oh, it's a she.  Oh, look how proud he was.  No, she does not.  He goes, no, she does not.  You should have said, yes, she does.  So you've got a female trainer.  Yes.  Do you feel like you work a little harder because you have a female trainer?  Because you're kind of trying to impress her a little bit?  Even if she's ugly.  It doesn't matter if they're ugly.  No, but I'm just full of such disgust before, during, and after. 
[01:19:30]  Really?  Yeah.  Well, now you know how we feel.  Now, why is that?  Just, you know, the club that I'm at sometimes, you know, when you have to do certain workouts,  the wall maybe has a mirror.  Oh, right.  You don't want to look at me.  And you're just kind of looking and you go, oh, I fucking hate myself.  How much longer are you going to keep this up?  For a while.  No, but you're feeling it.  For a while.  But inside, are you feeling like, ah, fuck this?  No.  Really?  This time, you mean business? 
[01:20:00]  No, I've actually seen differences in certain parts except the area that I really want to  go away.  Where is that?  I'll tell you the area I want to go away.  All of this.  Your toes to your head.  The upper body's getting really good.  It's just I want to get rid of this.  The pelican fucking?  The thing under the chin.  How do you get rid of that in a gym?  I don't know.  Do you put a little barbell on your lower jaw and then just open and close your mouth?  You might have to do one of those, like, Scott Shannon facelifts to have him pull back 
[01:20:30]  the fucking pelican neck.  Yeah.  Janine is suggesting blowjobs.  That should maybe get rid of it.  I don't know.  Does your dad have one of those?  No.  He did at one point, but he's so ridiculous from golfing now.  Golfing is not a workout.  Does he walk or take a cart?  Walk all the time.  I see that.  That's not a workout.  I golf and I walk around the course and then I feel like I still have to hit the gym after 
[01:21:00]  playing golf.  How much do you walk around the course?  You're a cart guy.  No.  Actually, they force you to get a cart, but I walk as much as I can.  I hate being in a cart when I play golf.  I love the cart.  Do you?  Beers, driving.  Yeah.  It's fantastic.  It's legal.  Drinking and carting.  Exactly.  Little tiny fucking roads that you barely fit on.  Certain places, the beer girls have their own carts.  Yeah, the beer girl comes along, you try to pick them up, you realize what a piece of  shit you are. 
[01:21:30]  They have no interest and every guy is trying.  Every single guy in the course.  Sam in Virginia.  Stop.  Hey, how's it going?  Hey, man.  Hey, I think Anthony should go with the female trainer, because when he's doing the bench  presses, he's either going to look up and see a camel toe or have a package on his forehead.  Yeah, a lot of times if you have a male trainer when you're doing bench press, the trainer's  basically teabagging you.  He's not going to be teabagged.  He doesn't mean to, but all of a sudden you're having a tough time with that rep, so he bends 
[01:22:00]  down to help you with the bar.  Next thing you know, you've got...  And his balls end up on your fucking face.  Not on your face.  He's basically kind of on your forehead.  Oh, like a Roman war helmet kind of a thing.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Look.  Let's say hi to Charlie in Florida.  Charlie.  What's up, pal boy, boys?  Hey, Iraq, what's the name of your trainer?  Betty Crocker?  You've got to give him that one.  That's pretty funny.  Betty Crocker.  All right, this is a little rough, but I mean, people need to know the answers to these 
[01:22:30]  questions.  Oh, sure.  Dave in Connecticut.  Dave.  Hey, good morning, boys.  Hey, Dave.  Hey, Ant.  I was wondering if you're going to put a tap for a protein shake down in the bar, or are  you going to get it straight from your trainer's dick?  You're an asshole.  Well, these are the questions people need to know.  It's just about getting in shape.  Why does it have to turn homo?  I don't need a female, male. 
[01:23:00]  It doesn't matter at that point.  And Danny keeps putting up pictures of like 1910 fucking, or 1800s weightlifters.  Old school weightlifters.  The guys with the handlebar mustache, and the barbells with the big round balls at the  end.  With their old school wrestling shorts.  Yeah.  And black socks on.  Let's say hi to cigars and scotch.  Cigars.  I admit it.  The only reason you're putting in this gym is so you can later justify putting in a  steam room.  You and E-Rock trainable. 
[01:23:30]  Shut up.  E-Rock, how much weight have you lost?  I don't know.  I'll have to go check.  You'll have to go check.  Yeah.  How long have you been with the trainer?  About four weeks.  Four weeks?  And you haven't checked?  I haven't checked in about a week.  Yeah.  Remember, muscle weighs more than fat.  I know.  Sometimes you're not going to lose weight.  Right.  You're just going to get out.  All right.  Let's say hi to a male.  This is Kelly.  Kelly in Illinois.  He's a male trainer. 
[01:24:00]  Kelly?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Hopi, you know, I am a male trainer, and I don't really appreciate what you're talking  about today.  This is not funny to me, because I am very tired of people thinking that I'm gay all the  time.  Yeah.  Here we go.  I am not fucking gay.  No.  All right.  All right.  I'm sorry, Kelly.  I don't appreciate it.  All right.  I'm sorry, Kelly.  That's the angry guy that it hit too close.  It's hit too close to home, guys.  It's the hit too close to home bit.  The new bit.  Well, sweeping the nation.  Well, we don't want to tell everyone.  Of course not. 
[01:24:30]  Anna, D.C., what's up?  Good morning, boys.  I love you guys.  Thank you, Anna.  Oh, what a perky-sounding girl.  Anthony, don't let them give you shit.  I am really excited for you.  I'm proud of you.  This is a good thing.  Oh, thank you.  Wow.  I think it's awesome.  They're going to be jealous when they see how much ass you're going to be getting this  summer.  I think you're going to see results.  You have man ass, of course.  They're saying.  Anna, you got a nice voice.  Are you hot?  I'm a drug rep.  Of course I'm hot. 
[01:25:00]  A what?  Drug rep.  I'm a pharmaceutical rep, so of course.  Oh, a pharmaceutical rep.  Yeah.  Yes.  I listen to you guys all the time, y'all and Ron and Fez, since I'm in the car so much.  Awesome.  All right, with a trunk full of drugs, right?  Yeah, what drug are you pushing these days?  Look at this.  Hold on.  Danny.  What the fuck?  God damn, Danny.  Is that going to be one of your workouts?  No.  Danny just pulled up a picture.  It's three guys stacked on top of each other.  Stacked on top of each other, just effing each other up the ass, and the top guy is 
[01:25:30]  jerking off.  Jesus.  And they all got their white socks on, and they're in a gym.  Shut up.  What's the drug of choice, Corey?  Anna.  Sorry.  Yeah, what are you trying to sell?  No, that's all right.  So I sell a drug for people with severe schizophrenia.  Nice.  All right.  Cuckoo, cuckoo.  Yeah, it's pretty interesting.  Are you a little nutty yourself?  No, of course not.  I like a good crazy girl. 
[01:26:00]  I listen to you guys, so I've got to be a little borderline crazy, right?  I hear you.  Yeah.  Got anything good?  Percocets?  Something fun?  Something we can hang out with?  Some oxy?  What do you got?  No, nothing you can party with, Anna.  I'm sorry.  Ah, fuck.  And when you start your diet, Anna, you're going to have to start...  It's not a diet.  Not the diet, but you've got to start getting on the goose and soda instead of those Guinnesses.  The Guinnesses are going to crush everything that trainer is going to have you doing.  I know.  That's going to be the problem.  It sucks having to cut down on the Guinness. 
[01:26:30]  That ain't happening.  Yeah.  I appreciate that.  Yeah, that's not happening.  Isn't there a way I could just work really hard to work off as much Guinness as I drink?  Well, I think they make a vaporizer for alcohol so that you could just inhale your drunkness.  That might be something to look into.  All right, Anna, call us back someday, all right?  All right, I will.  Thanks, boys.  All right, there goes Anna in D.C.  Thanks, boys.  Here's Corey in Virginia.  A lot of fucking D.C.  Hey, Anna, I wanted to tell you, you can still...  Keep drinking Guinness because your body doesn't really build muscle in your mid-50s, late-50s. 
[01:27:00]  Shut up!  This guy goes, can you really even build muscle at your age?  Shut up.  I was a kid when Al Haig was taking over.  I'm in charge here.  All right.  Well, that's good news, Anna.  So eventually you'll actually do stuff like that.  I'll keep you all informed.  Please let us know.  I know you're at the edge of your seats wondering how this is going to go and everything, and  I will keep you so informed.  I just think day one, he should have set the tone with something. 
[01:27:30]  No.  Day one had nothing to do with...  It was business.  Day one was the business end of it.  Yeah.  Business transactions being made, some paperwork, things like that.  That's it.  You don't just start fucking running.  Well, we're day four now.  Yeah, but he's not there every day.  So we're up to...  And it was the weekend.  How much have you done now that it's day four?  Nothing.  It's the weekend.  It was the weekend.  What about tomorrow?  Tomorrow is Tuesday. 
[01:28:00]  No, see, I don't have my doctor's appointment yet.  I want to...  You have to wait for the doctor's appointment.  Well, I didn't...  No, I don't have to wait for the doctor's appointment.  I could do, you know, cardio, treadmill, things like that.  But I want to get, you know, the full once-over.  Things like that.  Hey, we got your new trainer online.  Holy shit.  Oh, really?  Yeah, his name's Steve...  Steve C.  Oh, okay.  Steve C.  Hi, Anthony.  I just called to tell you that we'll be having a session this afternoon, and there will be lots of rubdowns and extra protein. 
[01:28:30]  All right.  Yeah, thank you, Steve.  It's not Steve C.  No, not Steve C.  Steve from Long Island.  You're great.  All right.  Thank you, sir.  Why don't we...  People.  Wow.  I'm trying to move on for you.  Oh, I know.  I really am trying it.  Yeah.  As I keep asking the phones.  Ted Poughkeepsie, what's up?  Hey, Ann, you should have asked that girl if she had Boniva for you, for your brittle bones.  I don't have brittle bones. 
[01:29:00]  I don't need Boniva.  I've had one broken bone in my whole life, and it was when I was, like, fucking nine.  All right.  Punch it out.  Asshole Boniva, my fucking ass.  Why don't we take a break?  Hate these people.  I hate you all.  Oh, it was nice that you shared with us today.  Yes.  Here you go.  Taxi cab passenger seriously hurt and crashed. 
[01:29:30]  Just got this on Twitter.  A taxi passenger was seriously injured when the cab collided with two other vehicles Sunday on Blah Blah Boulevard in Oceanside.  The cab driver was arrested.  Holy fuck.  This is exactly...  See, when I said earlier that you're safer drinking and driving than taking a Long Island cab...  Yeah.  ...people are like, you're fucking insane.  The media is going to pick up on your crazy statement.  Really?  This really just happened, Ann.  February 22nd.  So it's in the paper today.  All right.  Yeah.  So let me start over. 
[01:30:00]  Taxi passenger was seriously injured when the cab collided with two other vehicles at Oceanside.  The cab driver was arrested on drug possession and reckless driving charges.  Wow.  The passenger, a 54-year-old woman who was not identified, had head and internal injuries, police said.  She was knocked unconscious during the...  And the article continues, and I don't have the rest of it right now.  Yeah, that's all you need.  So there you go.  Yeah.  There you go.  I'm telling you.  It's a trade-off.  What do I want?  You know, all right, step out of the vehicle.  True.  I turn around.  Put your hands behind your back. 
[01:30:30]  Nice.  Oh, no, Deewey.  You should just get someone to drive your Escalade.  Everyone I know is a drunk.  How am I going to fucking do that?  Get Laszlo to do it.  Go Laszlo.  Laszlo did a great job Friday.  Laszlo came over Saturday.  Yeah.  A few beers.  Good.  It's always nice.  People just pop him by.  He was supposed to do a live from the compound, but...  His staff apparently has, like, Ebola and AIDS.  That sucks.  Oh, yeah.  Sucks for them. 
[01:31:00]  I know.  All right, a quick break, and then I think we should do the Tiger Woods press conference.  Yes.  We have some clips from the big...  I have one word that describes the whole thing.  Sincerity.  Honesty.  Robot.  Yeah.  Lifeless eyes.  Kissing his wife's ass.  Just trying...  I know.  Oh, we'll get into it after the break.  Oh, yeah.  Let's get into the whole thing after the break.  Please.  February, Black History Month.  This is what we do as far as that goes.  To celebrate Black History Month, the Opie and Anthony Show is paying tribute to those 
[01:31:30]  legendary African Americans without whom this country would not be the melting pot it is  today.  Today, we honor character actor Keith David, who has appeared in nearly 200 feature films,  but none of his roles are as iconic as that of Frank in John Carpenter's They Live.  You better find yourself someplace to hide and keep praying nobody ever finds you.  Put these on.  Hey!  Stay away from me.  I'm telling you, you dumb son of a...  Your drawn-out alley fight scene with Roddy Piper is the most ridiculous six minutes 
[01:32:00]  ever committed to film, Mr. David.  Stay tuned for more icons of Black History on the Opie and Anthony Show.  You...  Let's get physical, physical.  How will I get physical?  Let's get physical.  You asshole.  Travis is a dead Opie and Anthony.  Oh, Danny.  You're great.  Ah, he just turned you in. 
[01:32:30]  Is this going to be cranking from the compound as you're working out with your trainer?  My headband on and my wristbands.  Leg warmers.  Just back and forth.  Yeah.  Oh, my God.  That's funny.  Maybe you should just get some old school Jane Fonda tapes.  Yeah?  That Jane Fonda workout tape?  Yeah, why not?  Find a VCR.  Pop that in.  Make sure that the tracking is set right.  Fuck.  Tracking.  Let's say hi to Mike in Jersey.  I was a kid when those were out. 
[01:33:00]  What?  VCRs.  All right.  Hey, guys.  How you doing?  All right.  Fucking asshole from Geneseo blowing up my spot.  Go fuck yourself.  Yes, Mikey.  Hey, so it's easy to sit here and say Tiger's speech is insincere, but if you think about  it, everyone that has so much money invested in him, are they really going to let him get  up and just shoot without having his publicist write his speech?  Well, I mean, I loved what he said on Friday, but now I want to know what Tiger thinks. 
[01:33:30]  That wasn't Tiger at all.  You know what?  I don't give a shit about Tiger apologizing and all that.  All I care about is having Tiger play golf again, because I love watching him in these  golf tournaments, right?  But after Friday, you just realize he's not a likable person at all.  He isn't.  And we were tricked into believing that this guy was so likable and so nice and so sincere 
[01:34:00]  and blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.  I know he's had his issues with the media and some of the fans over the years, of course,  but in general, with the commercials and everything, you think, wow, this Tiger's a really, he's  a swell guy.  Swell.  That's the word, too.  Swell.  He's not likable.  He's an asshole.  He really, yeah, came off.  I mean, because he had a chance to really impress a lot of people on Friday, and first  of all, I said, nice, lifeless eyes, dick. 
[01:34:30]  Like, there was no emotion in his eyes, no emotion in his face.  He's reading a statement that his people put together for him.  I don't know.  Yeah.  Yeah, well, you know, there's Tiger Woods, the person, and then there's Tiger Woods,  the enterprise.  You know what?  You know what I said to the people I was watching the thing with on Friday?  I don't even think Tiger knows who he is.  I don't even think he knows who he is.  He was crafted into that person by his dad.  Right. 
[01:35:00]  And he did a great job, you know, making that whole persona.  Tiger, great golfer, nice guy, non-threatening, all that shit.  And then he trips over his own dick, and he's got to make this statement, which was very  insincere.  Just he read it, and he couldn't even sound sincere reading it, and just said what he  thinks everyone wanted to hear.  Yeah.  But I didn't believe one bit of what he was saying, especially about how him and his 
[01:35:30]  wife, he'll have to show, not with words, but with actions, that he has changed.  And it's like, you don't go like a couple of months where you cannot get enough pussy.  You can't fucking stop putting your dick in anything.  And then a few months later, you're just like, I really, I'm never going to do this  again.  I've let down a lot of people, and I'm done.  No, you're not.  Of course you're not.  You love the pussy. 
[01:36:00]  Yeah.  Perkins waitress.  Jimmy has tried to explain it a few times on our show.  The jury's still out as far as sex addiction.  Can you be addicted to sex?  I guess there is a sex addiction.  People have called it that.  All right.  They've gone to rehab for it.  But, I mean, but Tiger Woods is not a sex addict.  Why not?  Why not?  He's just an athlete that had opportunities and went for them.  Some people will call it a sex addiction because he sacrificed so much for something that gives 
[01:36:30]  him pleasure.  If it affects your life like that in such a negative way, then they call it, it affected  his marriage.  He was supposed to win more tournaments than he did?  His career, it affected, you know, it negatively impacted a lot of the positive aspects of  his life.  You know what?  Most of these athletes are doing exactly what Tiger Woods got caught doing.  Yeah.  Are they all sex addicts?  I, you see, that's just it.  I don't know.  He said Friday how he felt entitled, felt like, you know, he was above everybody else and he 
[01:37:00]  had these opportunities and da, da, da.  He's not a sex addict.  You just think he's a regular guy.  He's a man that wants a lot of pussy.  Loves the pussy.  He's in this position that he, he's expected to be everything to everyone at every minute  of his life.  I can't see how anybody can, can go through life like that and not have like major psychological  issues.  Yeah.  He, uh, I don't know.  He, he looked, I don't know.  I don't know what I'm trying to say. 
[01:37:30]  He looked like a robot.  Very good.  And he looked, uh, like he has no real emotion.  Like he kept looking up at the camera cause it was like, I think on the paper they said,  okay, as just before you read this next line, look up at the camera.  Yeah.  Yeah.  All right.  Read this.  Now look back.  I bet it was rehearsed a few times.  And then him after the press conference, like walking into the audience and hugging everybody  was like, ah, please.  It was a, uh, yeah.  Please.  It was what they call a dog and pony show.  Yeah.  I, I agree. 
[01:38:00]  Mm-hmm.  Uh, hey guys, one more thing, one more thing real quick.  Uh-huh.  Yeah.  Hey, in a Tiger Woods 2011, there's going to be a mini game where you pick up chicks.  See, you, you, like a GTA thing.  You wanted to, you wanted to do one more thing real quick and you've, you totally, now that's  what we remember him by.  That horrible bomb joke.  Let's say hi to G in Cleveland.  G.  Yeah.  I'm surprised that you guys, I mean, normally something like this, you would just say, I 
[01:38:30]  could really give a shit.  Only thing I want to see is him back on TV.  And I know you said that's all you want to know is when he's coming back.  But at the same time, why the hell would you tell, you tear him down about something  you know the only reason he's doing it for is to get his sponsors back.  He's not sorry.  He could give a shit about anybody else.  Well, that's what we're saying, Wanda.  I was going to say that.  Wanda Sykes.  This is, yeah. 
[01:39:00]  But, I mean, all you guys are doing is talking about what he looks like on TV and how is this  and how is that.  Well, yeah.  What else did you expect?  Well, it's, I don't, I swear, I don't care in the end, but it's our job to kind of look  at this stuff and then kind of give our.  Throw it around.  Yeah, throw it around a little bit on our radio show and I don't know what he was trying  to accomplish on Friday.  I have no idea.  I have no, I guess maybe to get his sponsorships back. 
[01:39:30]  But it's, his image is so tainted now.  I mean, Kobe Bryant was able to come back after his scandal.  I don't see how Tiger Woods comes back as far as sponsorships go after this scandal.  I mean, he's going to get back to playing golf and he's going to win a bunch more tournaments  before his career is done.  But as far as that squeaky clean image, no one's going to buy that anymore.  Well, I guess I always had the problem with the fact that anybody bought it at all.  Anytime you're out there in front of the camera, you're buying an image anyway. 
[01:40:00]  Now, for somebody to sit there and say, oh, this is, you know, he was a role model for  my kids.  You get the hell out of here.  Are you serious?  I mean, out of everything in this world that you could pick to have your kid to be a role  model of, it's just some knucklehead down the street who got lucky at making good at  being golf.  You act like he owes you something because he was good at what he did.  Right.  I'm sick of the people that keep saying that he owes me an apology.  He owes me this. 
[01:40:30]  He owes me that.  Tiger Woods doesn't owe anyone nothing, man.  The only thing he owes me is a hell of a golf game.  And that's all I want to see.  Oh, fucking yeah.  That's it.  But, you know, when he's on TV and they had all this coverage, it was like it was like  the president was given a fucking war speech the way they prefaced it and promoted it.  And then he gets on and proceeds to just be very insincere and what I think is just outright  lying, especially as far as him really being sorry for what he did. 
[01:41:00]  And I don't think he's sorry.  I think he's like, fuck.  I was I was fucking.  I enjoyed the shit out of it.  Right.  And now I'm caught and I'm screwed.  And this guy wants to be playing golf.  He wants to be playing PGA golf this weekend.  Yep.  And his people are basically saying, nope, nope, we got to do it this way.  You got to talk to the public.  Then you have to go back to the rehab for a little while.  And then you could finally start playing again. 
[01:41:30]  And maybe the public will accept you.  Yeah.  It's so calculated.  If anything, he's sorry he got caught.  The only person he owes an apology to is his wife and his kids.  And now they have to live with all of this backlash from everything that he's done.  If he never got caught, it wouldn't have been an issue.  You know what?  That's another thing I'm sick of hearing, though.  The only person he deserves an apology from him or needs one is his wife.  And you know what?  No, she doesn't.  She fucking, she fucking living the life of Riley, probably had an inkling of what Tiger 
[01:42:00]  was all about beforehand.  How do you think he was fucking her?  And the only reason she's staying with him is because he's Tiger Woods.  Now I completely, Jimmy was right about this.  Fuck the apology.  He just turned around and go, you're lucky with me, you bitch.  Jimmy's right.  Jimmy said, well, or Wanda.  This is the reason why I say he owes her an apology.  Is the fact is that he did stand in front of a minister and said that I will wholly be  faithful to you. 
[01:42:30]  Now, unless they made some backdoor agreement to say you bitch, you do what you do and I  do what I do.  Look, man.  But they didn't.  He got up and said, you are my one and only hoe.  So from here on in, this is what it's going to be.  And since he couldn't live up to that, that's where the promise, that's where the sorry  comes from.  Look, this Elan is pathetic, too.  I've turned the corner on her because I understand there's, you know, a lot of couples out there  where, you know, someone might cheat and they make a mistake or whatever.  But this, this tiger was like banging broads while she's pregnant. 
[01:43:00]  And I mean, he never really stopped being single.  She knows all this and she's sticking with him.  If it was a plumber, she'd be long gone.  Yep.  She's staying because it's Tiger Woods.  Now, I have to say that Jimmy was right the whole time because he said, in the end,  Elan will stay with Tiger Woods.  And even though they're not officially saying that, they're obviously trying to work this  out.  Yeah.  Ridiculous.  That's true, too.  Ridiculous.  Thank you, Wanda. 
[01:43:30]  G.  I know.  It's G in Cleveland.  You called back.  G.  Let's say hi to Victor in Baltimore.  Victor?  Hey, good morning, guys.  How you doing?  Hey, man.  Hey, first off, now, looking back at Tiger's career, I mean, just like a year ago, now we  know how he hurt his back and his knee.  He wasn't doing the golf course.  He was slinging it, man.  You never know.  He pulled a muscle.  Yeah.  Yeah.  He just had such a baby face that you don't expect that kind of guy to do that.  But, you know, like every other guy, it will fuck anything. 
[01:44:00]  You know what I mean?  All right.  Thank you, sir.  All right, man.  See you.  Yeah, let's say hi to Danny in Howard Beach.  Danny?  Hey, what's up, fellas?  What's up, brother?  Hey, man.  Hey, now, I think we can all agree Tiger's probably one of the best golfers and is just  going to keep on winning tournament after tournament, right?  Mm-hmm.  And he just has a shitload of money.  So why does he have to keep, why does he have to apologize?  What's with the public image?  It's not like he's going to suck at golf on that one. 
[01:44:30]  He's going to keep winning fucking tournaments.  And even if no one liked him, they're going to want to sponsor him because he's a winner.  Well, that's kind of true.  I think you're right.  I think as soon as he gets back on the golf course and starts winning again, that's all  the sponsorships you're going to care about.  The sponsors will all be right back.  But they do feel like we've got to save his image a little bit so he's got to do this weird  apology thing Friday.  Now the sponsors can at least go, all right, look, he went up there.  He gave his apology.  He deserves a second chance.  All right, here's another few billion dollars. 
[01:45:00]  Go wear this hat.  And Tiger's saying Friday to leave my wife and family alone.  We call that one privacy.  The next day, the front page was Elin holding one of their kids.  Of course.  Yeah, I guess they listen to you, Tiger.  Yeah, you can really make an appeal to the press to leave you alone during a crisis.  Boy, they're really going to stick to that one.  You know, Tiger was right.  I think we should leave him alone.  You know, everybody, leave Tiger alone.  Yeah, don't take any pictures of him or his wife or leaving a sex addict clinic or whatever 
[01:45:30]  the fuck.  Here's a little taste.  I don't know.  We got all these clips.  Any in particular you want to hear?  I think any of them you're going to hear.  Good morning.  Good morning.  And thank you for joining me.  Happy to be here.  Many of you in this room are my friends.  Many in this room know me.  Many of you have cheered for me, or you worked with me, or you supported me. 
[01:46:00]  Now, every one of you has good reason to be critical of me.  Why?  I want to say to each of you, simply and directly, I am deeply sorry for my irresponsible and selfish  behavior I engaged in.  Why? 
[01:46:30]  He has dry mouth, too.  You hear that?  Oh, my God.  And he's like, I want to say to each and every one of you, he got to compose himself.  I am deeply and pulsatingly and throbbingly sorry.  Fake composing himself.  Yes.  It was all written.  The paper said pause.  That's good.  Of course it did.  I'd like to say to each and every one of you, pause, chat.  I'll say it again.  Now I want to know what Tiger feels, because that was somebody else's statement and somebody  else's feelings. 
[01:47:00]  Who wrote that?  The one thing, these dopey sports writers, I've been reading all the dopey.  Phil Mushnick.  All of them.  Phil Mushnick.  Mushnick.  And the rest of them.  They said that Tiger blew it because he didn't invite the press in to answer questions.  That would have been a catastrophe.  How the fuck does he do that?  Right.  The guy can't field questions like off the top of his head?  You can't field questions?  About that?  There's no winnings.  There's no upside.  So yet, of course you control it. 
[01:47:30]  You give a statement that you control?  That's the one thing I will defend.  There's no way that he could answer questions.  Yep.  So whose pussy was the Titus, Tiger?  Yeah.  Tiger, are there more women?  Right.  Tiger, did you father any children during these?  Tiger, is your wife staying with you?  You want to comment on the sex tape that supposedly is out there?  Tiger, is your wife's vagina a lot bigger after the kids and that's why you're fucking everything? 
[01:48:00]  How do I answer that?  Yes or no?  They said he should have answered quite...  Really?  How is that going to work?  No.  Yeah, Mike in Oakdale, you're right.  Mikey.  Hey, what's going on?  Hey, man.  Hello.  I just want to say that I think Tiger...  I think this is just one of the steps in a 12-step program.  I don't think it had to do with sponsors or anything along those lines.  I think it was a little of everything.  Yeah, yeah.  I think his people are trying to convince him that he's some kind of sex addict. 
[01:48:30]  He knows he's not a sex addict.  He is...  And he's not sorry.  He knows he's not.  He's apologizing for his horrible behavior.  What did he do?  Obviously, he's cheated on his wife.  That is his deplorable behavior.  But it's not about his friends.  You think fucking Michael Jordan is sitting there giving a flying fuck that he cheated on his wife?  He's probably sitting around going, you know, how was that one? 
[01:49:00]  Perkins Waitress, what the fuck were you thinking, asshole?  Like, that's the type of shit.  You think Tiger Woods is apologizing to Michael Jordan for his indiscretions?  Hell no.  Stop it.  He loved fucking these girls.  He would love to continue fucking these girls.  Hell yeah.  Except with Perkins.  Somebody just wrote me on Twitter saying, I would love to give you guys credit.  Credit!  But your Twitter names are just ridiculous to try to get out there. 
[01:49:30]  He writes,  An FBI body language expert tends to think Woods was sincere.  What the hell does that even mean?  A body language expert.  He sat there like the fucking...  You ever see the episode of Star Trek where the planet turned into the Nazis?  Uh, no.  And at the end, they just drugged the guy that was supposed to be the Fuhrer and put his mouth behind the mic so they wouldn't see it move?  Bah, bah, bah, bah.  But what did that body language expert say?  He was sincere?  All right.  Because that's what Tiger looked like. 
[01:50:00]  Yeah, how could you tell if he was sincere?  You're right.  It was terrible.  Let's go to...  He just sat there.  Robin!  Holy shit from Detroit.  We haven't heard from you in a while.  What's up, Robin?  Hey guys, how are you doing?  Hi.  It's snowing like a bitch here.  I'm trying to get where I gotta go, but...  Well, at least you got some white in that city.  Amen to that, Opie.  I don't even know what that means.  I'm sorry.  Well, it works.  Sorry, black people.  White is right.  I love you.  What about the fact that he made sure to say that she did not beat the shit out of him that night when you know for a while she just beat the crap out of that guy? 
[01:50:30]  Yeah, he threw a couple of lines out there that almost were...  You know, Robin's on to some...  Lame excuses for rumors that he said were out there.  Right.  When you have to over-say it...  Yeah.  And where did he go for, like, weeks?  No one saw his face for weeks after it happened.  Yeah, if you wanted to disprove it, you would have shown your face.  Exactly.  I mean, he didn't get that from hitting a mailbox, I'll tell you that much right now. 
[01:51:00]  Technically, she didn't hit him.  The golf club hit him.  And her hand was on the other end of it.  I don't know.  You know, if you have a wife that's out of her mind with a nine iron in her hand and she maybe officially didn't hit you, but she's hitting everything else as she tries to hit you.  Yeah.  I think that's domestic violence.  Yeah.  Happening.  Well, not to mention, the guy was on Ambien.  He was practically in a coma, so he had no way to defend him.  Yeah, how much does she suck if she can't hit him while he's on Ambien?  On Ambien.  Yeah, he's moved in slow motion. 
[01:51:30]  Well, here's that part of the press conference.  Hold on a second.  Oh, goody.  Okay.  I know I have bitterly disappointed all of you.  I have made you question who I am and how I could have done the things I did.  I'm embarrassed that I have put you in this position.  What?  Doggy style?  For all that I have done, I am so sorry. 
[01:52:00]  Are you?  He's so sorry.  I have a lot to atone for.  Oh, God.  Here we go.  But there's one issue I really want to discuss.  Pussy.  I love the pussy.  See, if you want to discuss that your wife has never hit you and there's no domestic violence,  why do you have to read that off a paper?  Why?  At that point, couldn't it be a bullet point? 
[01:52:30]  Yeah.  Where you go, okay, I want to discuss Elin and where there was no domestic violence.  He's still looking down like, you know, reading this thing.  Wouldn't that be easy to just look at the camera and go, look, motherfuckers.  And go, look, look.  There's no domestic violence in my fucking household.  Of course, you've got to clean it up for network TV, but you know what I mean?  Yeah, but he kept reading.  But listen, you'll hear it for yourself.  A lot to atone for.  A lot to atone for.  But there's one issue I really want to discuss. 
[01:53:00]  And he looks down.  What's that issue again?  Some people have speculated that Elin somehow hurt or attacked me on Thanksgiving night.  It angers me that people would fabricate a story like that.  Elin never hit me that night or any other night.  It was in the day time.  There has never been an episode of domestic violence in our marriage.  It was after midnight.  Ever.  Elin has shown enormous grace.  Oh, boy.  Here he goes.  And poise throughout this ordeal. 
[01:53:30]  Elin deserves praise.  Not Blaine.  She deserves your cock, apparently.  She deserves praise.  Not Blaine.  You know what?  He's got to talk her up.  As a golf fan, I just don't like this Tiger Woods anymore.  Ha, ha, ha.  This is ruining it.  I really don't.  Now, you know what happened?  All the women who don't even matter as far as his career goes, I'm sorry, for the most part, are looking going, oh, that's so nice that he's, you know, his wife and everything. 
[01:54:00]  But he's turned around all the people that mean something, the fans of his in golf, are looking now like, ew, ew, stop it.  Someone on Twitter, I would love to give you credit, goes, Elin should go and fuck Phil Mickelson.  Phil Mickelson.  I mean, Phil's big body on top of her.  It's the only way that she could get Tiger back.  She's handled this with grace.  And what, smashing your windows out with a fucking golf club? 
[01:54:30]  There it was, Robin.  That's what you were referring to there.  Yeah, but I'm saying, he's no different than any other guy that's fucking around on his wife.  He's Tiger Woods, and he got caught, and he could give a shit less.  He'd have kept right on doing it, so he got caught.  That's the only thing he's sorry for.  But fucking around on his wife, he never even stopped fucking.  No.  No.  Other people.  He's sorry he got caught.  He never even slowed down.  Nope.  No.  He loves fucking. 
[01:55:00]  That's it.  He should just say that.  He should just say that.  I love fucking.  I love fucking.  And apparently, you know, it gets in the way of things.  And that's a problem, but I love fucking.  And I think anybody who marries a famous person like that knows full well.  They're out on the road.  You know, it's a well-known fact.  So she picked her battle she lost, and she's going to get a bazillion dollars.  Wasn't she a nanny?  Wasn't she a fucking nanny?  She was a nanny for another golfer. 
[01:55:30]  And it's like, she goes from nanny to being Tiger Woods' wife, and he fucks around, and  he's like kissing her ass now, saying that she's, you know, didn't hit me, and she handled  this with grace and poise and whatever the fuck else.  It's like, look.  Hey, nanny.  Hey, nanny girl.  You fucking bedazzled in jewelry now.  You know, you're living well beyond anyone's means.  All right.  I fucked around. 
[01:56:00]  Deal with it.  Whether I do or not anymore, you know, that's their business, whatever.  But for him to have to come out and sit there and kiss her ass and apologize?  Fuck you.  Trying to save someone.  Well, the thing is, if she could turn the clock back, she would have still signed on  that dotted line, because she's going to be a fucking rich bitch.  Of course.  She's walking away a winner, no matter how you look at it.  Right on.  All right, Robin.  Thank you.  Yeah.  Okay, guys.  This next clip, we don't have to go through all the clips, but I just noticed this next  clip proves that Tyree Woods is not a sex addict. 
[01:56:30]  Oh, really?  So this should be played.  Okay.  He explains why he was fucking all those women right here.  Ooh.  Right here.  I stopped living by the core values that I was taught to believe in.  I knew my actions were wrong, but I convinced myself that normal rules didn't apply.  I never thought about who I was hurting.  Instead, I thought only about myself.  Perkins waitress was breathing. 
[01:57:00]  I ran straight through the boundaries that a married couple should live by.  I thought I could get away with whatever I wanted to.  You were.  I felt that I had worked hard my entire life hard and deserved to enjoy all the temptations  around me.  Does that sound like a sex addict?  Yeah, kind of.  He blew up.  Well, it all depends on how you define it.  It sounds like a guy that was never able to be a guy when he was growing up hitting  a million golf balls every day with his dad yelling and screaming at him and possibly 
[01:57:30]  holding a golf club close by to fucking whip him into shape.  Yeah.  Who knows?  Who knows what that relationship was really about?  And then he never got to be a guy just out there doing his thing.  But you could also define it as, you know, he looked at it a certain way and didn't see  the problem in it, which is, you know, as far as an addict goes, that sounds like an  addiction.  But I don't think it's an addiction either, to tell you the truth. 
[01:58:00]  He knew there was, he knew there was, I don't know.  Jimmy would argue because Jimmy is an addict and he's got a different insight on addictions.  But sexual addiction is a weird thing.  It always, to me, seems like a cop-out excuse to get out of trouble that you got into by  fucking.  It's a celebrity thing, too.  Yeah, yeah.  It's very celebrity oriented.  I don't know when he, like, a regular Joe that's just going to therapy because, well, 
[01:58:30]  I'm a sex addict.  Right.  Well, are you?  Seems like a celebrity thing to get out of these scandals.  Yeah, yeah.  To patch things up with the wife, your image, publicity, things like that.  They go, oh, I'm a sex addict.  No, you like fucking.  There's a difference.  I felt I was entitled.  Thanks to money and fame, I didn't have far, I didn't have to go far to find them.  I was wrong.  I was foolish. 
[01:59:00]  I don't get to play by different rules.  The same boundaries that apply to everyone apply to me.  Do your own laundry, then.  There you go.  Drive your own car.  Do your own laundry.  Apply to me.  Fucking.  He doesn't believe me.  Clean your own house.  Come on.  You do.  You are special, Tiger.  You're special.  Here's Mongo the trucker.  I didn't know he was a Tiger Woods fan.  Mongo, you're a Tiger fan?  Well, I'm a huge golf fan, and Tiger was my favorite golfer up until he. 
[01:59:30]  Well.  It was so fake, I now have to go to my number two golfer, which is John Daly, because he  gives fat drunks like me hope.  Good old John Daly.  That's who Eland should get with.  John Daly.  Oh, God.  Just a fucking whiskey breath as he's banging her.  His beard is ruining that lovely Nordic skin.  John Daly's a big raging alcoholic with his beer belly just weighing down Eland. 
[02:00:00]  One quarter of a rod because he's so drunk.  He's got whiskey dick.  He's trying to shove it in with his fingers.  Trying to drunk fuck her.  Drunk fuck her.  John Daly's golf shirt looks like a NASCAR fucking uniform with all the patches on it.  Oh, I fucking love Daly.  He was on the show once, and he had a really good time, but he never called back, unfortunately.  That guy rules.  I thought I could play by a different set of rules.  You could.  You did.  Mm-hmm. 
[02:00:30]  You still could.  Stap.  Then Tiger apologized to the parents of kids who looked at him.  Waddle doodle.  As a role model.  Waddle-y doodle.  Tiger says he was in therapy.  Mm-hmm.  Tiger says he never used performance-enhancing drugs, even though there's some kind of relationship  with a doctor that has questionable ethics.  Why does he want to get that out?  Tiger says he's going back to Buddhism, so you have to find that religion thing.  Are you kidding?  He said he's going back to Buddhism?  Oh, yeah.  I didn't hear that part.  You want to hear that, Pete? 
[02:01:00]  Well, he goes, not many people know I was raised a Buddhist.  Really?  I have a lot of work to do, and I tend to dedicate myself to doing it.  Wow.  Part of following this path, for me, is Buddhism, which my mother taught me at a young age.  People probably don't realize it, but I was raised a Buddhist, and I actively practiced  my faith from childhood until I drifted away from it in recent years.  First, Buddhism teaches that a craving for things outside ourselves causes an unhappy and pointless 
[02:01:30]  search for security.  Oh.  It teaches me to stop following every impulse and to learn restraint.  Blah, blah, blah.  I can't even say it.  He sounds like he's doing a book report.  Yeah, yeah.  An oral report.  Doesn't he?  Yeah.  Like, he's been in front of the spotlight since he was, what, five on Mike Douglas' show, 
[02:02:00]  right?  He came out as a five-year-old or something, and he's been in the spotlight ever since.  Why can't he just talk?  Bullet points.  Okay, and now I'm going to talk about Buddhism here.  Why is he still reading it?  Why is he still looking down?  Buddhism?  Who knew?  I don't know.  He was Buddhist?  You've got to find a little spirituality.  Is that what it is?  Yeah, it's, you know, it's following all the rules to get back into the good graces of  the public eye. 
[02:02:30]  I don't think, is that, is that like, that sounds like a pretty harmless religion that  people don't really hate.  They asked the Dalai Lama, and the Dalai Lama, if you could believe this, said, who's  Tiger Woods?  No, he didn't.  He's, I swear to God.  Is the Dalai Lama that out of touch?  I mean, I understand he's stuck there in Tibet, and the Chinese are trying to kill him and  everything.  You've got to know who Tiger Woods is, right?  But you've got to know who Tiger Woods is.  Who's Tiger Woods?  He's only one of the most famous people in the entire world.  Yeah, I think you'd know who he is. 
[02:03:00]  There he goes, hugging.  Is that his mom?  Yeah.  Yeah, she looked down.  She's a wee little thing, isn't she?  She looked down very, very dishonorable.  Very dishonorable.  Very dishonorable.  She couldn't look Tiger in the eyes.  So I'm taking this samurai sword and throwing my body on it.  Yeah, well, I know.  Someone said, imagine.  Oh, here he is.  Bruce in Maryland.  Brucie.  Bruce.  Hey, how's it going, guys?  Hey, man.  Pretty good fairy name.  Hey, I was just thinking, you know, that would have been a great thing if, you know, 
[02:03:30]  it would have been an R. Bud Dwyer moment.  Yeah.  You know, Thornton's gone.  You know, his little confession, if he would have pulled out like a sand wedge and, you  know, blew his brains out.  Yeah, a little samurai action like Dan was saying.  Yeah, throw himself on the sword.  He put the samurai and the R. Bud Dwyer moment together there.  He just didn't look sincere.  I'm sorry.  All right.  We can skip ahead.  And then he ended it this way.  Finally.  Finally. 
[02:04:00]  There are many people in this room.  I have not had sex.  And there are many people at home who believed in me.  Today, I want to ask for your help.  I ask you to find room in your heart to one day believe in me again.  Thank you.  You're not Superman. 
[02:04:30]  Shut up.  Like everybody out there.  He's asking everyone at home, in that room, everyone watching, to please help him.  Just get back.  I'm not going to help you.  You're rich and you're fucking all kinds of shit.  Just get back on the golf course.  Let's say hi to yourself.  Say hi to Steve in Tennessee.  Steve.  What's up, boys?  Hey.  Hey.  All right.  Give this guy maybe a little bit of a break.  The dude plays golf for a living.  And he doesn't know how to talk in front of people. 
[02:05:00]  Let the dude play some fucking golf.  And you guys leave his ass alone for basically spilling his guts to the whole world.  And spill his guts.  He spilled someone else's guts.  He spilled someone else's guts on a piece of paper.  That wasn't his guts.  You believe that was Tiger Woods talking Friday?  I mean, he was talking Friday, yes.  But, I mean, was he talking?  Was that his words?  Dude, of course he's going to read it.  Why else wouldn't he read it?  He doesn't talk for a living like you guys. 
[02:05:30]  Just give the guy a fucking break.  He doesn't talk for a living.  What are you talking about?  He's been in front of the media spotlight way longer than I have.  He can sell it and escalate pretty well.  He's done a million interviews.  He's a spokesperson.  He's constantly talking in front of groups of people.  Of course.  He doesn't talk every day for a living.  I would say he does.  Just in a different forum.  Come on, boys. 
[02:06:00]  What are you eating?  Pistachios?  What the fuck are you doing?  All right, Steve.  You're annoying me.  What?  I mean, if you want to...  Crackle, crackle.  I don't like Tiger Woods anymore.  Is that it?  It took one fucking shitty speech?  Because I don't know who that...  I don't like him.  Because I don't think he knows who he is.  Yeah, well...  He sounded like a robot.  I just want to see him hit that fucking ball again.  That's all I care about.  In the end, it doesn't even matter if I like or hate him.  I just want to see him playing golf.  Just hit the fucking ball. 
[02:06:30]  Because he's the all-time greatest.  Yeah.  And now it's going to be great with the galleries fucking taunting him.  His caddy's already said he'll fucking beat up anyone that fucking taunts Tiger on the  course.  Yeah, any heckling.  And his caddy's going to run out and clock whoever fucking does it.  And Steve Williams just doesn't talk a good game.  Yeah.  He does.  He is.  He does just that.  He's an angry motherfucker.  He's been known to rip cameras out of people's hands and throw them into the water.  And he's a lunatic.  Yeah.  So it's going to get really interesting when Tiger gets back to play. 
[02:07:00]  I know you don't like him, Opie, but will you find a place in your heart to believe  in him once again?  I don't need to believe in him.  No, you must believe in him.  I don't need to fucking believe in him.  That's why it's like forgiveness is one thing.  But he said, to believe in me again.  Believe what?  That you can hit a golf ball?  I know that.  Yeah.  I don't need to believe in him.  That's all I ever had to believe in.  And here.  I'll still buy Nike stuff.  I don't care.  You're crazy.  What I'm saying, I don't like the guy.  I'm boycotting.  I don't like him at all anymore. 
[02:07:30]  That was really phony.  He's got his fucking shit to do.  Part two.  Is this Gloria Allred from Hannity's show?  Because she got beat up.  Oh, did she?  She got beat up on Hannity's show.  If the guys could find a clip or two of that, that's great.  Unless this is the clip.  I don't know.  Part two of this.  Tiger Woods' mistresses react to his apology.  Some good stuff there.  And our own Bobo reacting to the Tiger Woods press conference, because he happened to 
[02:08:00]  be here on Friday watching it with the rest of the gang.  Now, that's the important part.  I want to see what Bobo thought.  Who doesn't?  So, part two of the whole Tiger Woods thing after the break.  More of your phone calls, too, because people are outraged that some of the things we're  saying, Ant.  Outraged?  What?  I don't know.  I guess they bought in.  They bought into the whole thing.  Shrink the Kool-Aid, man.  You're just gatekeepers for Tiger, man. 
[02:08:30]  Just get back to playing golf.  Enough of this nonsense.  Enough of this dumb nonsense.  Opie and Anthony, stay there.  Opie and Anthony.  We're getting beat up on Twitter, Ant.  Ow.  The guy goes, Bob Patterson, 2-12.  You guys sounded douchey when you apologized.  You guys should know better than anyone.  It would be douchey when he apologized.  You hate Tiger Woods now because he made a douchey apology like you guys did after the 
[02:09:00]  Connellisa incident.  That's coming in a lot.  And also, Chris in Jersey.  Look, man.  Yeah.  What do you got, Chris?  Yeah, you're being very hypocritical.  How many times have you guys said you read crap and you don't mean it?  And also, you don't have a fan anymore.  How many fans would you have left if they all said that to you?  I think when we have had to apologize, everyone knows we didn't mean it.  We put it out there that we didn't mean it.  Do you think Tiger Woods is going to go, I wasn't sincere about that apology? 
[02:09:30]  Yeah, there's a couple differences.  We definitely weren't sincere about our apology.  Absolutely.  And everyone knew it.  And the other thing is, Tiger Woods does not have to say shit to continue being a great  golfer.  We, unfortunately, had a gun to our heads.  And if we didn't do our apology, we would have been fired.  Simple as that.  We had no choice in the matter.  And we made sure people understood that as Anthony read the big apology for the Condoleezza 
[02:10:00]  Rice incident.  It was blatantly obvious that it was, we didn't mean it.  And it's okay.  Maybe this is his way of telling you that he was sincere about it.  I don't, I don't, I think, I don't know, because he doesn't have to apologize to continue  playing golf.  You know what I'm saying?  No.  He's doing it to get all his sponsorships back.  That's the only reason he's doing that.  And the fake life.  Which is fine.  Crying almost.  Which is fine if that's what he's about.  That's fine.  But we're pointing out how fake it was. 
[02:10:30]  And that's what we try to do with the media in general and the stuff we see on TV.  All right.  Bunch it out.  Thanks, sir.  All right, man.  Bye.  Bye.  Bunch it out.  Well, I'll answer this question, too.  Jay in Ohio.  Jay?  OB, how are you this morning?  Good, Jay.  Question for you, sir.  Are you going to be first in line for 2011 EA Sports Tiger Woods Go?  Well, absolutely.  How do you?  Absolutely.  I love the golf games.  Hey, it's not that deep-rooted, huh? 
[02:11:00]  What am I trying to say?  I just...  He just...  I'm with you.  I'm with you.  He didn't come across likable, which is fine.  I don't...  Tiger Woods doesn't need me to like him to continue being a billionaire and the greatest golfer of all time.  That's all I'm saying.  I'm with you.  I'm with you.  And will I root for Tiger to win tournaments still?  Yes.  Yes.  Yes.  I understand.  Yes.  Yes.  Yes.  Thank you.  All right.  Let me say hi to Nick in Mississippi. 
[02:11:30]  Nick.  Yeah, how you doing, guys?  Hey, man.  You guys really are sounding very hypocritical today, I got to tell you.  You know, your situation when you had to apologize is just a small microcosm of what Tiger's situation is.  You know, he has everything to lose.  He can lose billions of dollars.  He can lose his wife, all his sponsors, and the bottom line to all this is all he had to do was make up this apology. 
[02:12:00]  Right.  So, I don't understand how you can't see it's the same exact thing as when you guys apologized.  Look, our opinions are what they are, just opinions.  In the end, Tiger Woods really helped himself by doing this Friday.  Absolutely.  Absolutely.  Without a doubt.  Absolutely.  I agree with that.  But I think the one thing Ant and I have brought to this whole apology thing is to openly admit that we never...  We never...  We don't mean it. 
[02:12:30]  We didn't mean our apologies over the years.  And we now pointed out that this is all bullshit when someone gets on TV and apologizes for what they did.  Yeah, but he's not a shock jock.  It's not sincere.  He can't be...  He can't not be sincere.  How is it hypocritical, though, when we're pointing out these phony apologies when all we've done is point out that we've done phony apologies?  Like, it's not hypocritical.  It's pointing it out that it's bullshit. 
[02:13:00]  No, it's inconsistent is what I'm saying.  No, it's not even inconsistent.  We have consistently said that apologies by public personalities are bullshit.  And we've done the same thing.  It's bullshit.  Now, if he said, I didn't mean that, or read it in a way like, yeah, let me just say this.  I apologize for fucking all the women.  Thank you.  So, then we would have been like, wow, he really didn't mean that.  Yeah.  But he couldn't do that. 
[02:13:30]  It's different for him.  Yeah, well, we did.  We understand he can't do that.  I mean, the one thing I wish we did was tell everybody in our audience anyway, because we live in this world, that the apology was bullshit with the Connalisa Rice thing.  I think everyone knew when Anthony read it that day.  Oh, that's why I read it like that.  That we had to fucking read it.  But they even gave us a speech and said, and you read this statement, and you make sure you sound sincere.  Remember all that, Anne?  Oh, I certainly do.  Like I said, flat out, if you don't read this apology, we can't continue with you guys. 
[02:14:00]  And we were scared to even say all this stuff until only, what, recently we finally told you guys about the inside?  Ten minutes ago.  I was there about the whole thing.  I understand your opinions and your opinions.  I just don't like the idea that Opie's giving up on Tiger now.  Just because of one bad speech.  No, no.  He's a little harsh.  All right, listen.  I didn't say I'm giving up on Tiger.  I love watching Tiger Woods every Sunday.  I love it.  And I will continue to root for him.  I want him to set all the fucking records in golf. 
[02:14:30]  Absolutely.  And I'll be playing Tiger Woods obsessively when the new game comes out.  Yes.  I'm just saying I just don't like the guy.  Well, okay, guys.  You take care.  Keep your opinions.  I'll keep mine.  All right.  They're like assholes.  Yeah, we all have them.  Everyone has one.  See, I think people are confused.  I can still root for him even though I don't like the guy.  Yeah.  Yeah.  He didn't come across likable Friday.  That's all.  That's all I'm trying to say.  Which is true.  He didn't.  Jamie Youngers or Jungers or Juggers or whatever the fuck her name is. 
[02:15:00]  That hot chick that he was banging.  Not the Perkins waitress.  Was she the hotter one?  I think she was.  That was the one I thought was the hot one.  Well, she had this to say about the Tiger Woods apology.  I don't feel sorry for him.  You know, I think that he should have apologized also to the people that, like myself, his  mis...  This whore wants an apology?  For what?  What did you do?  What does this whore need an apology? 
[02:15:30]  You didn't know Tiger Woods was married?  What the fuck is that about?  Are you fucking kidding me?  Wow.  She sounds like you.  What?  Saying I think he should apologize.  And he's sitting there going, why is Opie asking for an apology?  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  That gag.  That old gag.  I think you should apologize to us.  Wait a minute.  What happened?  Yeah.  All right.  Like myself, his mistresses, the ones that are out here, because we're dealing with a 
[02:16:00]  lot of stuff, too.  Dealing?  You're a whore.  You could have shut up and stayed in a fucking...  What is she talking about?  You could have stayed in your apartment, not said a word, and no one would have fucking  known you from anybody.  But she came out, made statements, everything else.  Like the other women that Tiger banged.  Yeah.  That you don't know about.  Because guess what?  They said, you know what?  Yeah.  I don't feel like being in the spotlight for being one of Tiger Woods' whores.  They're very good.  All those other bitches that he fucked that you don't even know about.  Are we all in agreement there's got to be a handful of other women out there that never 
[02:16:30]  came forward?  Has to be.  So no one knows who those women are.  They're living a private life, not going through all the things.  Oh, poor Jamie Jungers.  I, yeah, that was, I don't even know what to, I don't even know how to say.  Because you're stupid.  How I'm feeling.  Like, it's, I almost feel like it's a joke.  Well, take another pill.  An apology to me is crap.  That's right.  And then when you see him today, did he seem about the same emotionally as he did the 
[02:17:00]  day his dad died?  No.  What?  What do you mean?  That's why I said I don't feel like all of that was real.  There's a difference between apologizing for fucking whores and your dad dying.  Yeah, exactly.  Jesus Christ.  Exactly.  Take another fucking bar of Xanax, you fucking, listen to her.  I hate you, I hate you.  I don't know what she's on, if she's on anything. 
[02:17:30]  She sounded like she was.  She definitely sounds like she's on something.  Oh my God.  Apologize for what?  She needs an apology?  The load?  Just apologize for fucking putting a load on your tits.  And Gloria Allred, who has to always wear red.  Because it's all red.  Right.  Get it?  Reacts to the Apology with Jocelyn James.  Now, who's this one?  Who's that?  Which one is that?  Here's Gloria. 
[02:18:00]  I just watched Tiger Woods Apologize.  Ugh, driest pussy in the world.  Oh, I know.  And instant fucking boner wrecker.  Speaking of boner, are we going to find boner?  Oh, we've got to get to that.  Oh, boner.  Or boner.  Oh, boner.  Call home.  Boner.  Oh, boner.  Where's boner?  I don't know.  We've got to find boner.  Check out son.  Who knew that?  We've got to find boner, though.  Yeah.  Oh, God.  That Perkins waitress is so...  Boner's hurting.  Yeah.  Boner's hurting out there.  He is.  He's despondent, from what I heard. 
[02:18:30]  I think he's living with wolves.  Despondent.  I think boner offed himself, to tell you the truth.  You think we're going to find his decomposing body?  I think they're going to find boner somewhere.  Boner, washing up somewhere, or decomposing body.  Boner's jaw has dropped.  It is over for boner.  Ueno wants to know if I said this, Anthony.  Who cares what these whores have to say?  They're nothing but cum dumpsters.  Well, yes, Ueno, I did say that.  Oh, God.  Oh, that's the Ueno. 
[02:19:00]  Fucking Ashlyn Ueno's still listening.  Yeah, Ueno's still around.  Motherfucker, what's up, Ueno?  You've got to be, like, 60 by now.  I knew him when I was a kid.  Yep.  I was drinking with him when we got the news that Alexander Haig was...  Yes.  I'm in control.  I just watched Tiger Woods' apology on television, and he said that many people believed in him.  He also said he wanted to make amends.  He did not apologize by name to my client, Veronica, and I ask, why no apology? 
[02:19:30]  What the fuck is going on?  Wait, wait, wait, wait.  I love Tiger Woods now.  Does this dumb fucking bitch actually think he should have or would have gotten up there in front of his friends and family to apologize to his wife and the fans that he's let down and the children who he's a role model to and all that?  To apologize to the whores that he was fucking? 
[02:20:00]  Do you honestly think that would have been a good move on Tiger's part?  Is this woman crazy?  You don't apologize to whores.  No.  That's why we have whores.  You can do whatever you want to them, and you don't have to apologize.  More so than Tiger, knowing what he was doing, could potentially fuck his career and marriage and everything else up.  These girls knew exactly what they were doing and knew that if it came out and their name came around that they were going to be in the public eye about it. 
[02:20:30]  Right.  They knew what they were doing.  What does a Tiger have to apologize?  What did Tiger do wrong to these girls?  You know what?  That he's got to apologize.  That I'm Regis.  And in the whore world?  Yeah.  This is gold status.  Oh, big whore.  A lot of frequent whore miles.  You're a whore, Tiger Woods bangs you, and now you get to be a bigger whore.  First class whore. 
[02:21:00]  That's right.  You know what I got to tell you?  I fucking love this Tiger Woods all of a sudden.  Now he's the greatest guy ever, and Gloria Allred is a dummy.  Veronica had a three-year romantic relationship with Tiger Woods.  Yeah.  Taking loads on the face is not a romantic fucking relationship.  That's very romantic.  Oh, B?  Relationship.  Now, how you define romance...  You know what?  ...and loads on the face might be different for you.  Look, ladies, taking a load for someone's birthday, you know.  But if you're taking a load after a load on the face, it's not a relationship. 
[02:21:30]  Here's a load on your face.  Happy Valentine's Day.  Wow.  It's very romantic.  Only on birthdays.  Jesus.  Three-year romantic relationship?  What is this?  He was...  He's fucking...  Oh, my God.  This broad is insane, Joe.  She's delusional.  She's absolutely insane.  I hope they're trying to find the Sean Hannity audio, because, man, did he beat her up.  Oh, good.  On September 9, 2009, he texted her, quote,  Great thing is we have a lifetime of this, end quote. 
[02:22:00]  Fucking...  On October 1, 2009, he texted her, quote,  Baby, I'm not going anywhere or doing anything.  You please me like no other has or ever will.  It's called sexting.  Yeah.  What does that mean?  Where's the apology necessary for those texts?  As she's reading the text messages, does that sound like a relationship, or does that sound like a guy that's getting his fucking poison?  Does it say, and here's a quote, I'm leaving my wife, I'll marry you, this will be great, we'll get a house and have kids together. 
[02:22:30]  But no, Gloria Allred, stop it.  Boner!  Boner!  Boner's so gone, dude.  Boner is so gone.  Really?  D-E-A-D, I think.  Just a matter of time.  He disappeared in Vancouver.  He's gone.  A couple weeks ago.  Yeah.  That's Chekhov's son. 
[02:23:00]  Where do you think he is?  You think he has a frozen face somewhere in the mountains?  Oh, my God.  Oh, man, yeah.  If he left, oh, and he's just froze somewhere like fucking Nicholson in the end of The Shining, sitting on a bench.  Is that where you're going?  Good old Boner.  Yeah, poor Boner.  And did I tell you I love this Tiger Woods?  I've really turned the corner on this.  Please me like no other has or ever will.  I am not losing that, end quote.  He saw Veronica several times a month, every month almost, in their three-year relationship, and sent her about a thousand texts. 
[02:23:30]  Booty call.  He led her to believe that she was the only woman in his life.  What?  Other than his wife.  How?  Other than his wife.  Okay.  All right.  Other than his wife.  See?  All right.  The only woman in his life.  Other than his wife.  Other than his wife.  Isn't that bad?  Isn't that her knowing that she's fucking with a married man? 
[02:24:00]  Right.  Just stop it, Gloria, you cunt.  I hate her.  She was in love with him, and he told her that he loved her.  And yet he did not acknowledge their relationship today.  Fuck, you'll say anything when you have a Boner in your pants.  Did not acknowledge.  Is Boner in his pants?  Boner.  Oh, you think Boner's in Tiger's pants?  Yeah, Boner.  No, that's a different Boner.  Or that he didn't mention her name? 
[02:24:30]  Her name and all the other ones that she's lumped in with?  Mm-hmm.  Because that's what he was doing?  Oh, God.  What is she?  She is an idiot.  This world's going nuts.  Let's say hi to Todd.  Hi, Todd.  Hey, what's happening, boys?  What up, man?  You know, I'm just sitting here listening to this, and it's like,  is a crack dealer going to apologize to a kid's parents for getting him hooked on crack?  There you go.  There, see?  It's just, uh, this woman deserves no apology, and he shouldn't begin to apologize to a single 
[02:25:00]  one of those women he slept with.  This is insincere, too, because it's her client, so she feels she's got to do this to, so she  could bill an extra fucking half hour, hour to the woman.  Enough.  Yeah, and the point being, you know, you coming forward to say you had sex with Tiger Woods,  you know, yeah, there's women out there that had sex with Tiger Woods, but you don't know 
[02:25:30]  their names.  They decided to, you know, keep it private.  Dude, what's the apology?  What, what, I don't know what, what are the grounds that Tiger owes any of these women an  apology?  I don't know.  They knew what they were getting into, they knew it was Tiger Woods, they knew he was  married, and they were getting off on it, I guess.  Dude, track four, we're going to play track three here, wait till you hear track four.  The title of this, I don't even want to say what the title is, but wait, wait till you 
[02:26:00]  hear track four, but first this, as she continues with the apology thing.  Today was not an apology.  It was a staged public relations stunt.  Kind of like what you're doing?  Yeah.  Because what, what purpose are you serving to be in front of the media right now, Gloria?  Isn't it the same fucking thing?  It was a disgrace.  My client deserves better than this.  Why? 
[02:26:30]  Tiger is hiding behind handlers in a carefully crafted statement.  His storyline is that he had gone to rehab and has now emerged to make this statement, and  he's now going back to rehab.  But the rehab that he needs is not just sex rehab.  It is instead lying rehab, betrayal rehab.  And he needs that, a course on how to be honest with the women or this woman in his life. 
[02:27:00]  You got to be shitting me.  Whatever rehab Tiger participates in will not be meaningful or effective unless he acknowledges  the relationship that he had with my client, Veronica.  What relationship?  It was the same relationship he had with the other girls.  What is she?  When he was in town or close to the broad, he dumped some loads.  He texted her and, and, and yeah.  Maybe if she was lucky, they had dinner every once in a while.  Holy mother of Christ. 
[02:27:30]  This lawyer, lawyers.  Dude, she, she just turned me around.  I fucking love Tiger Woods.  Tiger is the best.  Tiger fucking rules.  Here's the track.  Wait till you hear this, Ant.  Oh, boy.  Veronica gave up her occupation, her primary source of income, her only source of income,  as a porn star.  How do you give up your occupation as a porn star?  It's very hard to get back into.  My, my cunt sealed up.  Yeah.  I don't know what, what to do.  It closed. 
[02:28:00]  This Gloria Allred is about to try to say here that, uh, Jocelyn gave up porn for Tiger.  It was supposed to take her seriously.  Come on.  Come on.  As a porn star.  As a porn star.  Because Tiger was very jealous and he could not stand the thought of her being with another  man.  Or 12 other men.  However, this former porn star is also a human being who has feelings and who has been hurt.  Yeah.  By DP? 
[02:28:30]  I guess she did DP scenes then?  Porn stars, human beings?  Um, no.  They're very, very low on the scale.  Yeah?  Yeah.  I think they're about two thirds human.  Hmm.  And the rest is porn star.  I think badgers are more human.  Yeah.  A ferret.  We've had enough porn stars in here.  We know that they're not really human.  Hmm.  ...feelings and who has been hurt and who has been devastated by the lies from the man  she loved and whom she believed loved her. 
[02:29:00]  It is time for Tiger Woods to take responsibility for the deep pain that he has inflicted on Veronica.  Deep.  Deep.  Deep.  She may not be his wife, but she was a very important woman in his life and it is time for  him to ask her for her forgiveness.  Cha-ching, man.  This fucking bitch is going to sue and jail.  How?  On what grounds?  I don't want grounds.  On what grounds?  What grounds?  This dumb bitch lawyer is fucking posturing right there. 
[02:29:30]  Look, we all got to rally around this Tiger Woods, man.  Yeah, yeah.  He's the man.  Punch up that Veronica picture.  I want to see what that fucking porn star looks like.  I forgot.  They're all the same to me.  And she was a very important woman in Tiger's life.  How was she important in Tiger's life if he had at least 14 affairs?  Yeah.  Isn't that the official number?  Yeah.  Something like that?  The more women he fucked, the less important Veronica is.  Look at her career as a porn star. 
[02:30:00]  Give me a break.  She's fucking ready for Bukkake with those glasses.  And Tiger made her give up her porn career.  Look, I know porn stars these days are looking for a little more respect, but come on.  In the end, we know what you are.  It's one thing if Tiger made her stop going to medical school to be at his house, care for his children, things like that. 
[02:30:30]  But for this dumb fucking lawyer to say that she gave up her porn career, you can't give up your porn career.  You could always go back.  And it's Ban Monday, right?  It is Ban Monday.  All right.  Hold on a minute.  A little bandage.  Well, anyone saying move on gets banned because we have every phone lit, which means it's still something people want to talk about.  Wow.  So you're...  That's an organization.  Oh, boy.  Move on.  Oh, boy. 
[02:31:00]  Maybe it's just that.  Oh, boy.  What happened?  Oh, yeah.  A little crash?  Oh, boy.  Oh, he's banned?  Yeah.  Goodbye.  That'll hurt.  That's going to hurt a little bit.  But goodbye.  What?  All right.  Well, now the porn star makes her statement.  Oh, good.  I would be open to a telephone apology.  Open.  Open to a...  You'd be open for anything.  She wants a telephone apology.  A big black one in your asshole.  She wants a telephone apology.  Telephone apology.  That's all Tiger needs is more phone records of calling these bimbos. 
[02:31:30]  Yeah, I'm sure his wife really wants him calling a porn star to apologize.  Look at that hiney shot.  Look at that awful fucking ass on that porn star.  All right.  I guess we're supposed to respect you as you're shoving your ass into the camera.  That's beautiful.  Was Gloria Allred looking at that picture when she said she's a human being?  She's a fucking fuck toy.  An aging fuck toy.  Oh. 
[02:32:00]  I would be open to a telephone apology from Tiger.  Tiger.  But I really feel that I deserve to look at him in person, face to face, in his eyes, because  I didn't deserve this.  That's going to happen.  Wow.  That's going to happen.  Dumb bimbo.  A lot of stability there.  Yeah, sounds it right.  That's good.  Real stable girl right there.  I've had to deal with a lot.  Oh, there's more.  Good.  And too much from him.  And because of him. 
[02:32:30]  And never had to come to this.  Come.  He knows that I was very straight and honest with him.  But for a long time, he lied to me.  I never wanted to cause Elan, Sam, or Charlie any pain.  But I'm not the sole cause.  Tiger pursued me.  And over time, I fell in love with him.  And he told me he loved me too.  I'm so sorry for my part in any of their pain, being Sam, Elan, and Charlie. 
[02:33:00]  When you have a full bag, you'll say you love a tree.  Oh, shit.  You'll say you love a tree.  His fucking bag was full.  Of course.  Holy shit.  This is a circus.  Does this dummy understand that when he married Elan, whatever the fuck her name is, he takes  this pure white Nordic woman, very scandal-free, wonderful, has kids with her, has to keep 
[02:33:30]  up the Tiger Woods image, right?  Did this dummy actually think Tiger Woods, the guy with all the sponsorships, the all-American  golfer, the, um, he was a kid.  His father brought him up.  Sure.  The morals that he had and everything.  And drag a porn star out as his fucking girl at some point in his life?  Yeah.  Is that what this dunce was expecting? 
[02:34:00]  Just look at his, yeah, his background.  Yeah, look at his background.  I don't think-  He couldn't be seen with the likes of you.  I don't think Mommy Woods would appreciate-  No!  Tiger bringing you home for dinner.  It wasn't gonna ever happen, and anyone who thinks that is a, a nut-  Ant, you're absolutely right.  Um, I'm making a move today.  You know how we have, uh, some all-star instant feedbackers?  Oh, of course.  Name a few of them.  You got Steve from Bayshore, you got Kevin from Connecticut.  Yeah, Cigars and Scotch.  Cigars and Scotch does a good job. 
[02:34:30]  Of course.  Well, I'm, uh, I am, uh, moving-  Cunt flaps?  Jordan Olsamer from Scranton, Pennsylvania.  What?  He's now an all-star instant feedback official.  Oh my God, well, let me hear.  Well, he writes,  My client gave up a chance to be lead actress in Cum Jug 17 to be with Tiger.  Cum Jug.  Yeah, she gave up.  I'd love to hear some of the roles she gave up.  Yeah, Danny, could you please, uh, give us, uh, a biography on this porn star? 
[02:35:00]  Some of the movies she started.  My client could have been making porno, but Tiger gave her the illusion that she would  be his forever.  That they would pull up in one of his sponsored Buicks to the fucking U.S. Open, and her fucking  fuck me raw tattoo on her thigh would be showing.  And this pill-popping bitch would walk around with the rest of the PGA wives.  Exactly, talking with the PGA wives with her giant fake tits, discussing, you know, how 
[02:35:30]  cum feels when it gets in both eyes.  What the fuck?  I don't know if she's a pill-popper, obviously.  Ah, come on.  I don't know shit about this woman.  Whatever.  She sounds very unstable.  Do we have some of the movies she started?  She really does.  Oh God, I need to know what she gave up.  Kramer vs. Kramer, was she, uh, I think she won an Oscar for that one.  What a wreck. 
[02:36:00]  And any of their pain, being Sam, Elon, and Charlie, but I can't help that I fell in love  with him.  You can't help who you love.  Really?  I just wish I was told the truth, and then I would have made other choices.  Tiger, however, hid many things from many people.  The truth.  He didn't hide his marriage, dummy.  Yeah.  And what truth?  The truth was he fucked you.  You want to read some of the films? 
[02:36:30]  All right.  Let's see.  Her latest was in 2009.  It's Mama Fucked a Black Man.  And then there's Milton.  Wait, wait, wait.  Can you slow down?  Yes.  So Tiger's supposed to bring this girl home to meet his mom, and she starred in Mama  Fucked a Black Man.  Uh, Tiger?  What, uh, what did the girl do?  What did the girl do?  Oh, well, Mom, she was just in a movie, Mama Fucked a Black Man.  But she doesn't do that anymore.  No, no.  It's about Tiger's mom. 
[02:37:00]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Oof, oof.  Okay, that is good, though.  All right.  I'm going to crash you.  Uh, Milf Blown.  Mm-hmm.  Uh, Milf Internal.  Seven.  Uh, yeah.  Porn Star Brides.  Uh-huh.  Big Tops 2.  Uh-huh.  Mayhem Explosions 8.  What's that about?  I can only imagine.  Something tells me it's not a-  Is that a lot of car crashes?  It's not a big special effects movie.  Oh, it's not?  No.  Uh, MIA, which is Milf's in action. 
[02:37:30]  Big Breasted Nurses.  Lex Steele.  Oh, 39.  Now, we've all heard Lexington Steele.  We know, uh, his, uh, he's huge.  Yeah, he's, he's an hour.  Milf Worship 4.  Mm-hmm.  My First Sex Teacher, 12.  Mm-hmm.  Uh, POV Casting Couch, 18.  Seymour Butts.  Mm-hmm.  Uh, yeah, Seymour Butts.  Shorty is, I-I-Z, fucking yo mama.  Fuck it.  Shorty is fucking yo mama, too.  Uh, Top Heavy 4 and Who's Your Mama. 
[02:38:00]  Damn.  Um, quite the, quite the resume.  Um, and that is what she thought would be good for Tiger to take around the PGA wives.  And she was so broken hearted that she, when Tiger didn't take her and leave his wife and  kids for a porn star.  It's, it's fucking insanity.  and the lawyer should be fucking strung up 
[02:38:30]  for even saying that  face to face with Tiger  stop  you probably would never face to face with him  I would like him to apologize  face to balls  like we usually were  yeah  safe to say he's probably seen  her back way more than her front  I'm sure  mama fucked  oh I didn't know this 
[02:39:00]  Morris in Tennessee  we're missing a movie  Morris what's up  yeah you ought to fail to mention  the legend of T. Becker Vance  she starred in  yeah  good job  this good?  yeah  alright  you know there was another movie  what?  she was in  Tin Cunt  and you know what  I love this Tiger Woods now  he's the best  I gotta rally for this Tiger Woods 
[02:39:30]  he really is the best  rooting for the big comeback  alright so Sean Hannity  had Gloria Allred on  yeah  well you just heard her in that  that audio  and  oh  Janine  Pirro  she's one of those judge  broads  that does a  yeah  a judge show  right  well they were on together  on Hannity  and fuck  this was some good TV  check this out  or maybe not  fuck  no  come on  come on  come on  come on 
[02:40:00]  okay  she wants an apology  to Gloria's client  but she's cheating  with a married  married man with two children  well and you know what  it's complete nonsense  Gloria  for this porn star  to suggest that she's  owed an apology  the only one who's owed an apology  is Elan  by this porn star  who carried out an affair  with a married man  and you know what  she says that she  bore two children  by Tiger  never told Tiger  but she's a porn star  suggesting  he was the only one 
[02:40:30]  who could have had these  who could have fathered  these children  how dare she come out  and say he owes her an apology  she's not even on the radar  screen here  and there is absolutely  no legal connection  between this woman  and Tiger Woods  to suggest an apology  or money like the other women  who got money  to remain silent  this is sheer lunacy  the man has apologized  he has done all of the  apologies that he needs to do  and the mea culpas  that's enough  wow  fuck 
[02:41:00]  it gets better than that  who is she  that's Janine Pirro  she's a tough broad  she does her lawyer show  I don't know which one  holy shit  it's on during the day  she laid into her  and it continues  because Gloria  yeah  says porn stars are women too  she gave up her career for him  whack-a-do  whack-a-do  whack-a-do  Janine blast Gloria  so it gets even better  two broads going at it  it's never enough  if you have lied to a woman  a rich  a powerful  a famous man  who hurts a woman  who devastates a woman 
[02:41:30]  and I might add  porn stars are women too  and they have a right  to dignity  and they have a right  to the truth  she was honest with him  she doesn't have the right  to anything  why does she have a right  the guy's married  no right  no right  to anything  and he insisted  that she give up  being in the adult film business  her only source of income  because he was very jealous  and he said he wanted to be  the only man for her 
[02:42:00]  on film  or not on film  okay  she gave that up for him  then she went into hiding  when the scandal  no I think he was worried  that she might catch  some kind of disease  so he figured  you know what  if I get her out of the porn industry  I'll probably increase my odds  of not getting something  right  true  it's like  what do you think about that  she's fucking some guys  that might  then she went into hiding  when the scandal  Gloria  you say that she gave up  her career  as a porn star 
[02:42:30]  is that for the three years  that she knew him  she gave up her career  Gloria  no  yes no  she gave that up  she gave that up  about two years ago  because he was so jealous  and he said  she was the only one  in the last two years  she's done 16 porn movies  I know that you said  that she gave up her career  I've got a list  of her porn movies  in the last two years  starting with  Mama Blank's a black man  don't say she gave up  her career  she didn't give up  her career  she's a porn star  who's trying to nail 
[02:43:00]  him for money  like everybody else  she should disappear  and go back to where  she came from  let me jump in here  well unfortunately  you have your facts  very wrong Janine  I know what the facts are  check the movies Gloria  check the list  I've got all the lists  and the dates  those films were shot  no those films were shot  before two years ago  they are now being distributed  because they knew  she was going to be famous  let me jump in here  for a second  you want to make her  obviously you want to make her  the wrongdoer  she is  no responsibility to her 
[02:43:30]  I say men who hurt women  have to apologize  she is the wrongdoer  she had an affair  with a married man  who had a pregnant wife twice  how dare she  it doesn't give him the right  to hurt her  not about him  it's about her  he's apologized to  who he needs to apologize to  he's apologized to his family  to his friends  to his wife  and to his foundation  she's not even in the picture  fuck  I've turned the corner  I love  I love Tiger now  and that broad's great 
[02:44:00]  she fucking  just yelled her right down  that's Janine Puro  I'm telling you  you don't want to deal with her  mama blanks a black man  she says  she brought it up  oh watch  they were filmed  and she held them back  until she was famous  amazing  of course  she didn't give up  she made 16 movies  Mayor on Long Island  we forgot one of her films  Mayor  oh  yes  her 17th movie  was Caddy Snatch  Caddy Snatch  we forgot about that  as we make jokes 
[02:44:30]  with golf porn titles  was she in Happy Gagmore  I think she was  as we make all these jokes  these are some of the titles  that will be coming out  when she goes back  into the porn industry  as she capitalizes  on this whole thing  she apparently never left  the porn industry  you know what  we can either take a break  and listen to nonsense  or play more of this audio  this audio is way too good  let's continue  yeah please  because uh  well I'll just play it  from Sean Hannity's show  he had a great one  with these two  going back and forth  how does him naming 
[02:45:00]  every woman  help him rebuild  his family at this point  now I ask that he name  my client today  because of that  very special relationship  that they had  over that long period  of time  and also call her  on the telephone  or meet with her  in person  to make sure  that this apology  is sincere  Gloria  he's trying to repair  his marriage  if he's going to go  meet with every woman  and apparently  the list is fairly long  he's never going to have  a chance to be a father  to his kids again  now I don't know  why you do this  and I want to ask you this  will your client 
[02:45:30]  apologize  to Tiger's wife  and children  if you heard  the news conference  today  then you heard her say  that she was sorry  for any pain  that was caused  but apparently  by the way  even someone  in Tiger's  inner circle  who was arranging  details  for them to meet  was aware  of Veronica  so we don't know  who else was aware  of Veronica  and Tiger's  relationship  with Veronica  but I am telling you  until he takes  responsibility 
[02:46:00]  and acknowledges  it's wrong  there's no real  apology  Sean  it's meaningless  it's a disgrace  it's a sham  and that's what it is  shut your yap  God I can't stand it  well you know what  Janine didn't let her  get away with that  she got right back  in there  if he has to now  go out there  and meet with  talk to  every mistress  that he's ever had  it will absolutely  eliminate any chance  he would ever have  to reconcile 
[02:46:30]  with his family  and you know what  I have to tell you  I think that Tiger  did his wife a solid  when he said  she's shown  incredible grace  and dignity  I mean he really  reached out to her  these women can't  wipe Elan's shoes  okay  and the fact  that they keep  trying to get  in the middle of this  is just a testament  to their desire  to be  part of a bigger story  and I'm surprised  there wasn't a press  conference with a shakedown  and everything else  that all these other  women have tried to do  the guy had affairs  he apologized  leave him alone  go away  go back to your 
[02:47:00]  porn films  that you never  stopped making  during the time  that you say  you could only  have gotten pregnant  by Tiger  it's absurd  you know  you can't throw  a woman away  like a used coke can  even though  a lot of men  she threw  Elan away  she would have  thrown Elan away  and marched in there  and lived in that  mansion in a minute  you know  let me tell you  something Janine  it's easy  for people  in the elite  like you are  to look down  your nose  at people  who are in the adult  film business  don't even go there  Gloria  I've fought for  battered women  my whole career  Gloria 
[02:47:30]  don't even go there  I'm talking about  people in the adult  film business  don't look down  I'm not going to get  into a contest  with you Gloria  because they have not  been as fortunate  as you have  Janine Perron  you know what  Gloria  you're the one  making millions  on all of this  don't even go there  well you have no idea  all I can tell you  is  how much did Rachel  you could tell make  according to CBS  and someone very connected  to you  she made at least  a million dollars  that was someone  very close to you 
[02:48:00]  who reported that  on CBS  well that person  has not worked  with my law firm  for eight and a half years  yeah man  Gloria  the business is good  for you right  god is Janine Perron  just knocking her out  I know  knocking her the fuck out  not even close  wow  and then finally  it's nice to see her  getting pwned  one more clip  do you want money  from him  are you looking  for money here  do you want him  to never play golf again  of course not  this isn't about him  this is about her  and the minimum 
[02:48:30]  does she want money  from him  let me tell you something  the bare minimum  that she has a right  to expect  is an apology  alright well  if he gives  the apology  if he gives the apology  will all lawsuits  go away  or is she going to sue him  there's not going  to be any lawsuit  because there are no  grounds for a lawsuit  that's why  that's the whole point  there's no legal  connection here  well whether or not  there's no grounds  for a lawsuit  and you know what  if any of your clients  want to sue  they should sue  the National Enquirer 
[02:49:00]  but they didn't sue  the National Enquirer  because what they said  was true  you know there are  a lot of people  a lot of women  in this country  that are hurt by men  oh this isn't about  women hurt by men  this is about  a porn star  who saw money  with a guy  with a lot of money  Gloria  you're obviously insecure  you won't let me  get a whole answer out  because you have to  interrupt  you're afraid  you're afraid  of the truth  Janine  and the truth is this  there are a lot  of women  in this country  some of them  are wives  oh don't preach Gloria  some of them  are having relationships 
[02:49:30]  with married men  and the men  lie to them  and that has to stop  and the women  are not going  to be silent anymore  alright thank you  both  yeah the women  are that stupid  to believe  that the guy  is actually  going to leave  his wife  holy shit  for a porn star  we got to get  Dana White  on the phone  not even a porn star  for just a porn chick  yeah  let's get Dana White  on the phone  these two should be  in the fucking cage  oh put them  in the cage  could you imagine  these two in the cage  just gouge each other's  peepers out  love it 
[02:50:00]  and Mike Wayne  Texas on Twitter  writes  she also starred  in  two girls  one five iron  so  see that one  it's actually  two girls  one tin cup  two girls  tin cup  would be good  yeah  I like the five iron  two girls  tin cup  is good  I liked it  I liked it  what the hell  we could fix it up  a little bit  if you like  tummies  and then finally  Bobo reacted  to this whole thing  and then we'll let 
[02:50:30]  this Tiger Woods  thing go  this is the important  person  to get to  Bobo  but we should comment  how great was that  Sean Hannity had a  fucking great show  there with those two  it's good to see  Gloria Allred  just get put in her  place  trying to fucking  say that this woman  is entitled  to an apology  what did Tiger  do to her  that warrants  an apology  and Gloria  nothing  Gloria sees  dollar signs  of course  somewhere  she wouldn't be  doing this  pro  pro  Jesus Christ 
[02:51:00]  what's that word  pro bono  oh  Veronica spend  any time in a  closet  huh  then maybe she  would have  deserved an  apology  huh  oh yeah  she's laughing  she might want  to call Gloria  what are you laughing  at Danny  what's up  nothing I can say  nothing I can say  on the radio  what happened  me and D-Boy 
[02:51:30]  Travis going  through some  golf movies  oh  anything worth  saying yet  nothing I  could keep  my job  and say  I've seen a lot  of golf movies  and I just  don't have  anything in that  one unfortunately  actually there's  not even a lot  of golf movies  this is what  Bobo had to say  he watched a  press conference  with Sam  and the rest  of the gang  on Friday  alright so  Bobo we just  saw the Tiger  Woods press  conference  what do you  have to say  well I have  to say  this is what 
[02:52:00]  he's really  saying  that's terrible  I'm sorry  and that's  very funny  that's from  the show  what did you  take from  the press  conference  I think  he's lying  okay  another catchphrase  that's very  cool  I think  he's lying  and I have  to say  another thing  about him  oh uncle  Paul  now what  does that  even mean  it means  he may have  been with  some underage  what  based on what  that's something  you're made  up  well Tiger  admitted to  being a sex  addict 
[02:52:30]  he did  when  when  this  whole  ordeal  first  got  took  place  when  it  was  when  word  of  it  got  leaked  out  and I  also  think  that  he's  talking  that way  because  he knows  how painful  it must have  been to have  his dick  get sewed off  after it  was  he didn't  admit it  that his  wife tried  to cut  it off  where did  you find  out about  this  dick  cut off  thing  I'm  I could  tell by  the look  in his  face  by the way  he was  talking  that  something  happened  when  his 
[02:53:00]  wife  found  out  because  I've  heard  when  people  find out  that they've  been cheated  on  they'll do  some pretty  fucked up  stuff  look what  happened  to Anthony  and Jill  Nicolini  cut off  his dick  no  but  he  held  his car  hostage  concluding  what do you  think that  we learn  from this  we learn  that  you can't  stop  you can't  stop  if someone's 
[02:53:30]  horny  they're always  going to be  horny  I appreciate  your time  and I thank  you for being  here with  me  ok  get the  cameras  I think we  have to  apologize to  the audience  now for that  what an ass  he is the  pro of  misinformation  sorry about that  what happened  it was supposed  to  Tiger got his  wiener cut  off  is after  underage  girls  is that what  Bobo said  amazing  a puddle  of AIDS  cleaned up  the joke  by the way

[02:55:30]  Seth  McFarlane  and Bill  Maher  talk  Palin  and the  word  retarded  and the  actress  came out  and said  that Sarah  Palin  doesn't have  a sense  of humor  if she wrote  it herself  it was  well thought  out  and articulated  quite nicely  who knows  these days  who writes  what  Opie and  Anthony  know what  makes that  piece so  great  Steve's out  today  yeah  exactly  I didn't even 
[02:56:00]  know that Steve  was out today  until  I think about  an hour ago  I realized  that Steve  wasn't working  today  yeah  I guess  it's his  birthday  or something  yep  so he's  out today  apparently  it happens  to be another  Monday  which makes  that comedy  piece pretty  funny  yes it's  Monday  Opie and  Anthony  what else  is going on  god damn  man this  Hurt Locker  might win it  might win it  the Hurt Locker  wins six awards  including best  picture at the 
[02:56:30]  British Academy  Film Awards  yeah I guess  they like it  getting closer  to the Oscars  and we got  the Hurt Locker  winning best  picture in some  of these award  shows  so it's a  simple movie  with a simple  story it's done  very well  it's filmed  very well  the acting's  really good  that's it  it's like  it's I  enjoyed it  too simple  for me  too simple  as far as  winning best  picture  great movie  loved it  too simple  loved it  no I think 
[02:57:00]  so though  I just mean  it was like  a simple  movie but  it  like it  didn't  overcomplicate  things  there wasn't  this fucking  love triangle  in it  we didn't  need that  crap  you didn't  need some  kind of  subplot  story between  some other  thing you  didn't care  about just  so they  can make  you wait  to get  back to  the part  of the  movie you  want to  see  yeah  like I  hate that  filler  shit  well we'll  see what  happens  yeah  see what  happens  a lot of  people went  and saw  Shutter Island  over the  weekend  too  yes how's 
[02:57:30]  that how  did that  do  40 mil  that ain't  bad  beating out  Valentine's  Day and  Avatar still  making the  top five  that's  unbelievable  I think  De Niro  looks at  DiCaprio  and goes  like  he's putting  him in  everything  oh I see  what you  saying  like Scorsese  yeah  Scorsese  just putting  DiCaprio  in everything  he's the  new De Niro  for DiCaprio  for uh  well they're all  three guineas  that's a good  observation  yeah  yeah I think  uh  DiCaprio's gonna  be what  Sinatra in his  next flick 
[02:58:00]  playing Frank  he's gonna  play Frank  for Scorsese  he's gonna do a  film on Frank  Sinatra but  apparently he  won't be  singing  I guess they're  gonna lip sync  that because I  don't think  Leonardo DiCaprio  can sing  and uh  if you're gonna  have Frank  Sinatra singing  songs it  better sound  good  maybe you can  get some  Frank fans  all pissed  off  you get  Jamie Foxx  to do the  Sinatra singing  yeah do that  he could dress  up like Frank  now that we  all know that  he's a great  singer right  of course he  was on the  we are the  world thing  he's gotta be  good  all right  when is this  Alice in  Wonderland 
[02:58:30]  coming out  is there  is there  a problem  with this  movie  because you  know when  you see the  posters around  town they  don't have a  date  yeah  it kind of  says Alice  in Wonderland  coming  coming soon  coming soon  that's  March 5th  they finally  got a date  on that  March 5th  rumor has it  they were waiting  for what  Avatar to get  out of the  3D theaters  or something  yeah  it looks  like it's  gonna just  be amazing  it looks  really weird  yeah  they're also  they're still  trying to get  deals with  movie  with like 
[02:59:00]  cinemas  yeah  because Disney  wants to shorten  the release  why  because they  want it out  on DVD  before the  summer  oh  because I  guess they  found that  like the  most money  you make  is in the  first 8  weeks  so they  want to  cut a  usual release  I guess  is 17  weeks  and they  want to  cut it  down to  13  and then  get it  out on  DVD  yeah  and then  get it  right out  on DVD  and the  theaters  have to  be saying  fuck  you  we can  make  some  more  money  in those  four  weeks  you try  to take  away  from  my  exactly  and the  theaters  are afraid  that people  are going to  be like  oh it's  going to be  out in a 
[02:59:30]  couple months  on DVD  I'll just  wait and  watch it on  Blu-ray  in my house  but it's  3D  I know  you won't  see a 3D  at home  you know  it's time  to just put  these movies  out in the  theater  on the  DVD  and on  demand  all at the  same time  all at the  same time  just do it  who cares  people are going  to be pissed  theater owners  pissed  DVD people pissed  fucking movie  companies pissed  how about the  consumer  what about us  hmm  Governor Patterson  Governor Patterson 
[03:00:00]  is the  kookiest  governor  in the  country  and we  have him  here in  New York  and he  thinks he  has a  chance  at actually  winning  he's going  to get  his ass  has he  seen the  polls  no he  hasn't  seen  anything  I know  where you're  going  of course  enough  on that  yeah  he's also  claiming  race  is playing  a large  part  in his  plummeting  approval  rating  which I  don't even  understand  how that  works  because  there  haven't 
[03:00:30]  been  any  real  racial  problems  with him  it's been  money  problems  he  pretty much  can't  get  the New  York  politicians  to work  together  so I  don't know  what he's  bitching  about  race  we're  too  busy  making  fun  of the  fact  that  he's  blind  he's  all  googly  eyes  worry  about  that  he's  a  black  man  yes  I don't  see color  all right  and  was that  it  oh  remember  last week  you were  talking about  revolution and all that 
[03:01:00]  with that guy  oh right  boy  a lot  a lot  of shows  and message  boards  and  chat rooms  were discussing  this  guy  Stack  that flew  the plane  into the  IRS building  because he was  disgruntled  right  and a lot  of people  saying  don't support  what he did  by any means  but  kind of  agreeing with  his points  that he made  in his  letter  his suicide 
[03:01:30]  note  his manifesto  his  rambling  diatribe  all the  things  it was  called  well  in general  we said  that something  is bubbling  out there  just bubbling  brewing  there's something  brewing  whether anything  comes of it  who knows  it seems like  there's a lot of  frustration out there  and another story  hit  you hear about  this guy  who bulldozed  his own home  yeah  that's another  one  see  it's like  this happened  he was going  into foreclosure  and he said  oh yeah  really  watch what I  do  like many 
[03:02:00]  people  Terry Hoskins  has had  troubles  with his  bank  but his  solution  to foreclosure  might be  unique  Hoskins  said he's  been in a  struggle  with River Hills  Bank  over his  home  for nearly  a decade  a struggle  that was  coming to  an end  as the  bank  began  foreclosure  proceedings  on his  $350,000  home  when I  see  I owe  $160,000  on a home  valued at  $350,000  and someone  decides they  want to  take it  no  I wasn't  going to  stand for  that  so I  took it  down  Hoskins  said  Hoskins 
[03:02:30]  said  he got  Hoskins  said  he'd  gotten  a  $170,000  offer  from someone  to pay  off the  house  but the  bank  refused  saying they  could get  more  from selling  it in  foreclosure  oh wow  so he  could have  well a lot  of people  not a lot  of people  but some  people are  trying to  do this  let's say  yeah this  home is  worth  $350,000  to begin  with  he only  owed  $160,000  on it  right  so some  people are  going you  know what  I'll just  find someone  to buy  my home  $170,000  I'll walk 
[03:03:00]  away  I'm out  of debt  I'll walk  away  with $10,000  and he's  out of debt  so he doesn't  foreclose on  the house  right  doesn't ruin  his credit  right  and then  the bank  goes no  yeah the bank  says no  we'd rather  have it go  into foreclosure  then we could  get another  guy to  pay the  $350,000  for the house  or probably  even more  now  yeah  I'll tear  it down  before I  let you  take it  Hoskins  told them  and that's  exactly  what Hoskins  did  well yeah  the Moscow  oh Moscow  man  well he's 
[03:03:30]  from Moscow  Ohio  oh  yeah  no no he  wasn't  he isn't  rushy  I know  I thought that  too  is it really  a Moscow  yeah  Moscow  Ohio  the Moscow  man  used a  bulldozer  two weeks  ago  to level  the home  he built  and the  sprawling  country home  is now  rubble  buried under  a coating  of snow  from coating  exactly  as far as  what the  bank is  going to  get  I plan  on giving  them back  what was  on this  hill  exactly  as it  was  Hoskins  said  I brought 
[03:04:00]  it out  of the  ground  and I  plan  on  putting  it  back  in  the  ground  see  these  are  the  kind  of  things  that  don't  just  happen  people  have to  be  really  angry  to  bulldoze  your own  house  over  bank  has  no  comment  and  well  to  probably  make  banks  think  twice  before  they  try  to  take  someone's  home  and  if  they  are  going  to  take  it  wrongly  the  end  result  will  be  them  tearing  their  houses  down  like  I  did  mine  Hoskins  said  so  yeah  people  are  getting 
[03:04:30]  rambunctious  a little  angry  with the  government  with  handling  things  unbelievable  Obama's  fucking  squawking  about  his  health  care  again  good  luck  with  that  doesn't  he  realize  the  longer  he  shuts  up  about  that  the  slower  his  approval  rating  times  it  doesn't  stop  but  I  think  at  this  point  that's  all  he  wants  to do  with  his  presidency  yeah  that's  his  legacy  I  think  if  he  feels  like  he  gets  some  kind  of  health  care  bill  passed  then  that's  good  enough  yeah  good 
[03:05:00]  luck  it's  great  every  picture  you see  it's  just  oh  does  he  have  the  pappy  hair  coming  in  yes  sure  yes  sure  well  let's  talk about  the  penis  tree  what  is  the  penis  tree  I  don't  know  never  heard  of  Danny  what  is  the  penis  tree  well  I  think  it's  in  Arizona  now  a  man  was  trying 
[03:05:30]  to  get  rid  of  a  tree  and  his  friends  had  some  fun  with  him  oh  and  now  some  neighbors  are  a  little  upset  about  it  kill  joys  I gotta  go  backwards  because  there  was  an  AHL  game  over  the  weekend  minor  league  hockey  for  you  yeah  and  I  guess  it  was  in  the  Syracuse  area  or  Syracuse  itself  and  it  was  the  first  outdoor  AHL  game  and  Patterson  dropped  the  ceremonial  puck  did  he  and  we  got  a  guy  that  was  at 
[03:06:00]  the  game  here  hi  sir  how  you  doing  what's  up  first  time  long  time  yeah  I  don't  know  your  name  that's  why  I'm  calling  you  sir  oh  I'm  sorry  it's  Chris  from  Whitehall  hey  Chris  what do you  got on  this  Patterson  dropping  the puck  the game  was held  at  New York  State  Fairgrounds  and  they  they  they  gave  him  the  mic  and  he  started  talking  and  they  booed  so  bad  you  couldn't  hear  him  talking  at  all  they  said  that  after  he  dropped  the  puck  and  he  walked  back  they  said  he  was  crying  because  he  got  booed  so  bad  that's 
[03:06:30]  sad  now  an  old  black  blind  man  crying  that's  a little  sad  poor  bastard  he  actually  thinks  he  might  have  a  chance  I  don't  he's  so  gone  I  heard  the  other  day  somebody  referring  to  Giuliani  as  presidential  candidate  Rudolph  Giuliani  really  yeah  it's  the first  time  I  heard  it  called  that  you  think  it's  his  time  to  make  a  run  in  it  yeah  I  think  he's
