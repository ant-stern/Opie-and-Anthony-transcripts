<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast from New Orleans during Super Bowl week opened with Opie, Anthony, and Jim Norton engaging in extremely vulgar and sexually explicit conversation. They bemoaned their exclusion from the main Super Bowl events, contrasting their makeshift studio (described as a “walk-in closet with electronics”) with the accommodations of other radio personalities like Covino and Rich, whom they derided.  Their long career without ever broadcasting from a Super Bowl was a source of frustration.  The hosts then discussed the death of Ed Koch, sharing anecdotes and making sexually suggestive comments about the former mayor.

A significant portion of the show was dedicated to a viral video of a security guard in an Atlanta mall aggressively confronting suspected drug dealers.  The hosts played the video, reacting with expletives and commentary, speculating on the guard's background and predicting his potential violent demise. Their commentary included racist and homophobic remarks.  The show then shifted to discussing the arrest of DJ Whoo Kid, speculating on the reasons behind it (ranging from child support issues to assault to a revoked driver's license), and briefly addressed inaccurate news coverage of a past incident involving the show. The entire first segment remained consistently laden with highly offensive language.


A subsequent segment heavily focused on a lawsuit between Bubba the Love Sponge and Todd Schnitt. The hosts vehemently criticized an inaccurate news report that misrepresented the trial and other radio personalities, including Ron & Fez, falsely claiming they'd sued their employer. They used highly offensive language ("cunt," "whore," "fuck," etc.) to express their anger and frustration.  This segment also detailed the Bubba/Schnitt trial, speculating on other shock jock lawsuits and the challenges to free speech in radio.  They discussed a Steve Dahl and Mancow Muller case.  The conversation then veered to an older politician's uninformed comments on video games, a comparison of old (Nintendo) and new (Xbox) gaming consoles,  and the hosts' continued complaints about their exclusion from SiriusXM's Super Bowl coverage, providing a detailed list of the included shows.  A comedic, sexually explicit “Cock Talk” segment featuring a caller's account of his first homosexual experience was aired.  Phil Mickelson's near-miss at shooting a 59 in golf was analyzed, with clips of the missed putt reviewed.  Technical difficulties, specifically a computer malfunction and ongoing problems with the “Radio Wizard” (their IT support), further fueled their frustration. The segment ended with more complaints about management, lack of support, and general dissatisfaction with their employer.


The next segment centered on the hosts' perceived lack of support from SiriusXM management, comparing their situation unfavorably to other, seemingly less successful, podcasts and shows.  Their anger and disappointment were palpable, expressed through strong language. The hosts detailed their difficulty obtaining information about Netflix's payment rates for stand-up specials and the slow progress on their own proposed special.  They contrasted their situation with the perceived success and proactive management of comedians like Kevin Smith, Joe Rogan, and Adam Carolla, using the metaphor of being "stuck in the mud."  Discussions included various SiriusXM personalities, their exclusion from Super Bowl activities, a manager's unresponsive phone calls, and technical issues with a video submission for their stand-up special. A humorous, though increasingly agitated, bit involving one host's apparent intoxication and a subsequent call to their boss, Scott, occurred. A Black History Month bit featuring a humorous, racially charged segment about the ice cream scoop was also included.  The segment was punctuated by poor call quality and audio difficulties.


A later segment detailed the hosts' experiences at a recent broadcast event and their frustrations with network management ("Gary").  Their lack of preparation, relying on CM Punk’s presence, and dissatisfaction with the event's overly elaborate production (contrasted with their preference for a simple setup) were highlighted.  They speculated about the network's embarrassment regarding their show. Anthony's purchase of a large 90-inch TV dominated much of the discussion, focusing on the humorous difficulties of delivery and installation, with exaggerated comparisons to his genitalia and bribery of the delivery men.  Guests Nikki Glaser and Sarah Shaffer from "Nikki and Sarah Live" then joined the show.  The conversation shifted to their show, its live format, their experiences, and the challenges of live television.  Glaser discussed her past relationship with Joe DeRosa, her recent sobriety, and financial struggles. Shaffer discussed the show's creation and pitching process. The segment concluded with promotions of their guests' show and their own appearances, along with more banter.


The final segment began with David Tell promoting his comedy shows.  The hosts then read a commercial for "Mask Sexual Flavors" oral gel strips, leading to vulgar, sexually explicit jokes and anecdotes with a caller. A female caller recounted losing her virginity while listening to the show, prompting further sexually charged banter.  Sam Roberts then took over, eventually securing Eric Griffin (from *Workaholics*) and DJ Who Kid as guests.  The conversation with Griffin explored racial stereotypes, the changing landscape of offensive language, and his experiences with racism.  A discussion about a viral video of a mall security guard tasering a woman, with explicit commentary on racial implications, followed.  DJ Who Kid, recently arrested, recounted his jail experience, including details about his cellmates and attempts to avoid unwanted attention. The conversation remained highly explicit and sexually charged throughout Who Kid’s call. The segment concluded with further promotions and closing remarks.

[00:01:00]  Thank you. 
[00:01:30]  Thank you. 
[00:02:00]  Thank you. 
[00:02:30]  Thank you. 
[00:03:00]  Thank you. 
[00:03:30]  It's going to melt your mind.  So vulgar.  Shut up, you fucking degenerate hippie cocksucker.  I would take a shot in the face for a minute.  Very small cock.  So flatulent.  I've farted three times since I've been here.  I'm like, all right, you'll be an Anthony shop.  Here we are.  Another four hours of love.  The jokes all end up talking like cock and balls. 
[00:04:00]  This is good practice when I do the view.  Quite simply, the greatest show in the history of broadcasting.  This probably is the greatest net ever existed.  You guys are having a good time or what?  You guys are having a good time or what?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Rules are destroyed.  And convention burns the ground.  Don't do it.  I can't take it.  Every time I'm on the show, it's his cock.  With Opie, the destroyer.  You're a bigger douchebag. 
[00:04:30]  You're a big douchebag.  That's what I do now.  Anthony, the Rage.  Yeah, yeah, your guy had a corner on the peanut.  We understand.  I'll give it to your guy and the peanut.  And Jim Norton, lover of the transgender.  That's why I can't even take fingers in my ass,  because it makes me feel like I have to shit.  All kidding aside, dicks have to feel wonderful,  but I just can't take them.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  Strap in. Strap the fuck in.  This one's gonna hurt.  But enough of this palaver. 
[00:05:00]  Let's get the show on the road.  Surprise, surprise.  We did it.  Live from New Orleans, it's the Opie and Anthony Show for the Super Bowl.  How do you sound?  Check.  You sound all right, Mars?  Yes.  Unbelievable.  How they pulled this together at the last minute.  It's beyond me, but, uh, god damn. 
[00:05:30]  It's about time.  Yeah.  I hear you, Jimmy.  You all right, Jimmy?  Yeah, I'm just tired.  Here on Radio Row, as they call it.  Radio Row.  In New Orleans.  Nice.  I just wanted to hear how it would have sounded.  Yeah.  Oh, I had a good one I was gonna do.  Oh, what were you gonna do?  Oh, my God.  It's Joe Montana. 
[00:06:00]  Yeah, that would have been exciting.  I just felt like doing that to see how it would have sounded.  No, we're in our walk-in closet with electronics in it.  And for some reason, we're not down at the Super Bowl, and you fuckers out there, I hate you all.  I hate you all.  Oh, boy.  They're all just tweeting me pictures of other shows from here down at the Super Bowl.  Everyone is down there taking pictures.  You're supposed to be fans of the show.  With celebrities and sports figures, and they send them all to us on Twitter, yeah. 
[00:06:30]  They're showing me everyone else having a good time down there.  Yep.  Why wouldn't they send us?  I don't get it.  I don't know.  We asked last year.  There's average shows at best down there.  Average shows at best.  Last night, my wife and I were watching TV, and she's just checking Twitter.  And she goes, who the fuck are Covino and Rich?  Oh, man.  Well, I was just keeping it at average at best. 
[00:07:00]  Wow, you name names.  Damn.  You know, she doesn't listen to the radio, but, you know.  Well, those guys also are willing to travel on less of a dial.  I explained to her that it's two guys versus seven.  Covino will sit on Rich's lap on the plane.  They have one seat.  We're a couple of guys who only need one plane seat.  Yeah, they're pretty low.  Well, and then the one guy does two shows, so, you know, they're getting a nice bonus with him.  Rich isn't either an animal or he hates his living situation.  Rich is.  He can't be here enough.  Rich is a strange dude, man.  He's a nice dude, but he's a strange dude. 
[00:07:30]  And he's down there doing two radio shows for Sirius X.  Mashup and Covino.  We got the Sway who's not here today because he's down there at the Super Bowl.  Sway.  Sway.  Yeah.  And we're here for the 19th year in a row.  I think it's 19.  We've been doing radio together 18 and a half, so I'm assuming that there's like a, that,  yeah, the Super Bowl.  We would have had our first shot before our first year anniversary, so it has to be 19.  This is our 19th year in a row without a Super Bowl. 
[00:08:00]  All the highs and the lows this show has been through over the years, and never have we  ever broadcast from a Super Bowl.  Not once.  And we were in Boston when they went there, I think a couple times, right?  Jesus.  And then we were in New York when the Giants were in once or twice, three times, something  like that.  Wow.  So we were even in the home fucking city of one of the teams playing, and that wasn't  even good enough to get us down there. 
[00:08:30]  That's amazing.  Look, these are the fucking...  Oh, look at that.  These are so-called fans of the Opie and Anthony show sending me these type of pictures.  Wow.  Look how happy they are.  Oh, they are so happy.  They're like, we're not in winter anymore.  Unbelievable.  We're right off Bourbon Street broadcasting.  Nicole really puts the foot in football, doesn't she?  With a giant ped.  God, they're extremely happy.  Look at that.  Oh, my.  They met Papa John himself? 
[00:09:00]  Papa John.  Oh, God.  You don't know who Papa John is?  Oh, that's the guy.  The fucking pizza guy.  Yeah, he's the Papa John guy.  He's the pizza guy.  I'm sure he'll have a Super Bowl commercial.  He does.  That's, you know.  He does.  Yeah, and he's been involved with the NFL and stuff, you know, as far as commercials.  Who else have they met so far?  They've only been down there a few hours, because we saw them in the halls yesterday.  Oh, my God.  Ed Koch is dead.  Oh, he did die.  Oh, no.  Wow, he did die.  We were supposed to have him on, I think, yesterday.  Right? 
[00:09:30]  Yeah, but then I read that he got moved to intensive care.  Well, no.  He's now dead.  We can update that.  That was the latest update.  He's moved to the basement.  Yeah, they're bringing him in an elevator right now.  Yeah, my year I wanted to win.  Wow.  Ed Koch is dead.  I wanted to interview him.  Fuck, man.  His documentary was great.  Yeah.  He was, you know, the mayor of New York City back in the day.  Dead Koch.  Wow.  Wow.  First one.  They were hinting that. 
[00:10:00]  They were hinting yesterday that it wasn't looking good at all.  No.  He kept having fluid building up in his lungs.  It was in the paper a few days ago that they took out 16 pounds of fluid from Ed Koch's  body.  Oh, my God.  And then they sent him home, and then it quickly came back, I guess.  And now he's dead at 88.  Damn.  That really sucks.  That stinks.  That sucks for New Yorkers, man.  He's legendary.  How am I doing?  Not too good.  His documentary was so fucking good, man. 
[00:10:30]  It was so good.  His honor.  His honor.  Well, he was a liberal, but he was a very, when it came to racial stuff, he never caved  in, which to his detriment.  Right.  To his detriment, he did not cave in.  And some other stuff that he did that you were like, wow, that was a more, he's for the  death penalty, he was against the Ground Zero Mosque, even though that was after his tenure.  Yeah, but he was always in there.  Yeah.  He was always giving his opinion about politics long after his term was over.  He was the mayor for how many years?  Twelve. 
[00:11:00]  He got twelve.  Three terms.  He lost his last term, Dinkins, he was the incumbent, and Dinkins got the nomination  and then beat Giuliani, and then, I guess, lost to Giuliani.  What years?  78 to 89.  Oh, wow.  Okay.  Over some frozen yogurt.  So he was the mayor for most of the...  All the 80s.  All the 80s.  Yeah, man.  Yeah, Ed Koch.  Yeah.  And we were supposed to, we were supposed to, Lloyd Braun on his committee.  What's this Seinfeld stuff?  What?  Is that Seinfeld? 
[00:11:30]  Of course it is.  Lloyd Braun.  He, uh...  The city was bankrupt, and they would give no money to New York, and he actually...  Was he the mayor when they said, when Washington said, basically, fuck you?  No, I think...  That famous headline.  What's the actual headline?  I will veto any bill that will...  No, but there was a headline.  I will do any veto.  Yeah, four to the city, drop dead.  Hey, drop dead!  Was that...  I don't think that was Koch.  No, it wasn't.  That's why I'm asking. 
[00:12:00]  I think it was Abe Beam, yeah.  Was that before?  And Koch was smashing him in the campaign.  Abe Beam.  But he did some unpopular stuff.  I mean, he came in, and he had to cut jobs, and he did a lot of stuff that people didn't  like, the unions protesting.  And helped Bloomberg out, because he opened the New York mayorship up to people that probably  don't like girls too much.  Yeah, you know what?  He really was Bloomberg's hero, I'm sure.  His lifetime partner made some announcement about...  Oh.  His assistant and lifetime friend, they call him.  What, Ed Koch? 
[00:12:30]  Ed Koch, yeah.  So he never...  Well, was he?  You gotta be careful how you say this shit.  I'm gonna say...  I'm gonna venture to say that it looks very, very much like he was a homosexual.  I'm gonna say that you could have called him Ed Koch-Watley.  As far as I'm going with this.  Maybe he was just asexual.  Maybe he was.  But he had a long-time assistant slash friend.  Oh, he certainly did.  I'm bummed he's dead, but we didn't get to interview him.  Fuck.  You would have fucking liked meeting him. 
[00:13:00]  Get a picture with him.  A picture would have been nice, but I would be happy.  It was a phoner originally.  Maybe we know someone at the hospital.  Down at the morgue.  We could prop him up for you, Jimmy.  Or if worse comes to worse, the tombstone never moves.  We got time for one more.  Well, in the documentary, he visits his tombstone, and he addresses being gay.  He addresses it, and he, because gays hated him, or the idea of it he addresses.  And gays hated him because during the AIDS epidemic, they thought he should have come out and made it easier for them. 
[00:13:30]  And he said that, well, if I come out, then that's kind of legitimizing the question.  And then you can ask any politician.  He goes, so here's my answer.  None of your fucking business.  Wow.  He said that in the documentary.  He said none of your fucking business?  None of your fucking business.  Oh, none of your fucking business?  None of your fucking business.  I think I got to respect that.  I love it.  That's pretty good.  In the end, you got to respect that shit.  He was fierce.  He was a fierce guy.  He was a fucking business in the end.  Nicole's fucking shoving her tits out into Troy Aikman. 
[00:14:00]  Oh, yeah, I know.  That was taken yesterday.  Holy shit, is she shoving her tits out into him?  She wants Troy Aikman's love child, you think?  Oh, yeah.  You think she's going the love child route?  Oh, yeah.  For a payday, like Dan Marino's chippy there.  What's that?  Oh, boy.  Oh, fuck.  Why?  Why?  Why?  God damn it.  You know it's going to happen.  They met Aikman.  They met, yeah, man, they're down there.  Next year.  No, next year we're going to be stubborn and not go because it's right there. 
[00:14:30]  Just because it's like a mile away.  Oh, shit.  How the crow flies, it can't be more than two miles.  Right?  Well, I mean, they're doing all the festivities.  How the crow drives, it's four hours.  Yeah, it's a lot of traffic.  No kidding.  No kidding.  No kidding.  No kidding.  No kidding.  Terrible drivers.  Their feet break on the pedals.  Little feathers trying to steer.  So, wow, we start the show with the news that Ed Koch, the old mayor of New York City,  is dead at the age of 88.  Ed Koch, he was the mayor during the gritty years. 
[00:15:00]  Yes.  Him and Abe Beam, of course, too.  But he was the mayor during the gritty years of Manhattan, New York City, the way you remember  it, with those big soot-spewing buses.  Just really dirty.  There was a lot of porn theaters and muggings in Central Park.  The big joke about Central Park, like Johnny Carson to get on and talk about, you know,  he was mugged.  Right.  You know?  Yeah, yeah.  But, like, that was New York City.  And what a transition. 
[00:15:30]  You know, now that I, well, I've lived here now about 10 years.  You're right.  I mean, growing up in Long Island, you were scared to come into New York in a way.  Yeah.  And you didn't venture around that much.  No.  You kept with your friends or if it was a bus trip or whatever, you were a little nervous  and scared.  You went where you were going.  And if you had a concert to go to at the Garden, you took the train in, you fucking never left.  Went upstairs.  Yeah.  You never left.  And went back to Long Island.  Saw a fucking, uh...  Charlie Daniels. 
[00:16:00]  BTO.  And then...  BTO.  Saw a fog hat.  And then went back downstairs and got on your damn train back to Long Island.  Yeah.  The safety of the suburbs.  But now, you know, Central Park, it's like...  I don't consider that...  You still gotta watch your ass no matter what.  Maybe in the northern part of it, right?  More so where they...  Up by Harlem, is it worse up there?  Oh, that's racist.  I take the big loop, especially when it's warm, you know, about three times a week.  And I go all the way up to the north part of the park because, you know, that's where  the...  It's a little tricky up there? 
[00:16:30]  No, no.  Not at all.  Never had a problem.  At night?  But you gotta be aware always and just kinda, you know, look out for yourself.  But Central Park is just filled with families.  It's nothing like it used to be.  No.  No.  No.  None of that wild.  They got their problems still here and there, but...  Need some good old-fashioned wilding to go on.  Right.  They're wilding.  Did they not do it, though?  Did they...  Did those guys not rape that jogger?  That's where wilding came from, was with that jogger.  And now it's like...  Was Sharpton really right about that? 
[00:17:00]  Oh, who the fuck knows?  Well, someone raped her.  Like the DNA...  I cried wolf enough times.  I know.  The DNA connected to the guy who came out years later, the Spanish guy.  They didn't do it.  Yeah, I think they were all...  They were innocent.  Really?  Oh, really?  What happened to them afterwards?  They're the running citizens?  What happened?  They were in jail for all these years.  They had a big lawsuit.  They were burnt at that time.  Well, they were guilty of something.  Right.  They were guilty of being black in America.  Oh, boy.  Holla.  I see.  Did you see the new video of that guy at that mall in Atlanta? 
[00:17:30]  Dude, I love him.  That guy's a star now.  But like you tweeted, he's going to have a problem.  He's so dead.  You said he's going to be dead, right?  Drug dealers don't give a shit.  I'll tell you why that mall guy is going to get shot, too.  Because he gets you out, but then he keeps it going.  He'll taunt those motherfuckers.  Yeah, man.  He'll walk out like, guy to go.  Yeah, bitch.  It's like, dude.  Yeah.  Right in front of their friends.  Come on.  That are obviously outside.  Come on.  I'm here.  I'm here.  And it's on camera.  Yeah.  Now they're like on YouTube on Worldstar looking like punks. 
[00:18:00]  Yep.  Not good.  He will be shot for that if he's not careful.  Yeah.  There's going to be...  That won't end well.  Well, that was just for the people that don't know, we played the video of the lady getting  tased from that mall.  Now there's two more videos.  There's one of him chasing out drug dealers and another one of him just, I guess, doing  his job.  Right.  Which apparently is trying to chase out drug dealers.  I just wouldn't do that job.  Hells no.  I would take that job, but I would kind of hang around and just drink coffee. 
[00:18:30]  Oh, fuck yeah.  Are you kidding me?  That mall looks terrible.  That looks like the worst fucking mall in Somalia.  I really thought...  Holy shit.  When I saw this for the first time, I thought it was some kind of Caribbean island.  Right?  I really didn't...  I didn't know it was in Atlanta.  I didn't read all the shit.  It's astounding.  That looks like some fucking, yeah, African nation, third world nation.  And the only difference is their clothing's a bit better. 
[00:19:00]  Let me see it.  No, man.  You'll see that in...  Oh, yeah?  Yeah.  The sneaks on that big tall guy with the red shirt.  You'll see all that on the Caribbean islands.  Yeah, he taunts these guys.  Like, I'm here.  Yeah.  These are guys who you got to let...  Crank up a little volume there for a sec.  Take you into custody.  We understand that.  Do you understand that?  Still, don't walk in here again.  Don't walk in here again.  He knows all the drug dealers.  Hey, listen.  Come here.  I tell you, if you walk in here again, you're going to jail. 
[00:19:30]  You walk in here again, raise your hand.  Raise your hand.  Don't walk in here again before you're going to jail.  He's pointing the taser at him.  Don't walk in here again before you're going to jail.  Does he?  Yes.  Now, you want to test my word?  That, as a matter of fact, was a gun.  No.  Yeah.  You want to test my word?  Stand firm.  He's got a real gun.  Can you pause right there?  What you doing, man?  That's a...  I love that line. 
[00:20:00]  You want to test my words?  Stand firm.  Like...  Yeah, yeah.  If you want to see if I'm...  He's really a bad fucking dude, man.  He's fucking a psychopath.  He is really not afraid of these guys.  That's what you need.  I want to know where is this guy from that he is completely unafraid of drug dealers.  There's an interview with him on some news, some news organization, did an interview with  him, and you see him, and he's talking, going, yeah, and he kind of looks a little nerdy. 
[00:20:30]  Really?  He's wearing glasses.  He looks a little nerdier than I would have expected.  I saw the photo of him, but I didn't hear him talk.  I don't want to interrupt the video, but I just...  No, that's fine, because it just goes on like that, where he's like, you know...  Yeah, it just goes on and on.  It's about nine minutes long.  You want to test my words?  Stand firm.  Stand firm.  Interview with tasering...  Which guy is he?  Is he a big dude?  Yeah, he's not a little guy.  He must be able to fight.  I mean, you can't... 
[00:21:00]  But also, he pulls the batons out.  He's like dual-wielding fucking batons and shit, you know?  What is he doing?  He's going to get himself into a problem.  Yeah, I don't think that's a problem.  Hey, the mall's in the middle of downtown Atlanta.  Yes.  Yeah, that fucking...  Did you say that?  I know it's Atlanta.  I didn't know it was downtown.  Yeah, it's fucking...  Pretty much right in the middle of downtown Atlanta.  Atlanta security guard interview.  Yeah, I think that's the one.  It's just amazing what ends up going viral.  People are all about this.  People love this guy now.  He's fucking...  I would go to that place now, because it's like a... 
[00:21:30]  It's famous?  Disney.  Yeah, it's famous.  Oh, here it is.  Channel 2's Amy Napier-Vitari talked to the man who tasered that woman about what he says  are ongoing problems at a downtown Atlanta shopping area.  Lee.  How do you been?  Lee.  The woman in this video spits as she's asked to leave the Metro Mall property on Peachtree  Street.  The manager recording the incident from earlier this month points a taser at her to get her  to walk away.  Instead, the woman spits at him again.  There's quality of life issues at hand and...  They don't show the areas. 
[00:22:00]  There he is.  He's been the on-site manager at the Metro Mall in downtown Atlanta for one year.  He carries a taser, firearms, and also wears this camera.  GoPro.  I feel like the taser and the camera are the two most effective tools that I have.  Long records every altercation with people he considers a threat to the business's security.  Do what you're supposed to do, or, you know, you get what's coming to you.  But what is the purpose of all of this?  Pause.  You got problems, right?  What you need to do is clean up the neighborhood so I'll...  He's a bad fucking dude.  He looks nerdy, but you can tell he's... 
[00:22:30]  Oh, hell yeah!  He would absolutely be a problem.  Look at that screen cap.  That face?  Yeah.  That's who that guy is.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  He is a problem.  This guy is a fucking problem.  He loves pushing these motherfuckers around, too.  He loved tasering that hood rat.  He loved it.  I want to know where he is from that he is so comfortable.  Like, how is he...  Like, was he one of those guys who would have went this way, but he went that way?  Maybe, yeah.  He's really unafraid of these guys. 
[00:23:00]  It looks like he's got a nice little story behind him, yeah.  Yeah.  But I don't think the news will get to any of that.  What?  We can try.  I would love to get this motherfucker on the air.  Anybody know this guy?  No, but...  No, I mean, we've got a big audience.  Maybe someone out there does.  There might be a person in...  Yeah, you never know.  The ATL.  Help us out.  Yeah.  Help us out, Atlanta.  You want to listen to this?  Hell yeah.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Businesses can come in, and then downtown Atlanta can prosper.  Neighbors Daniel Van Briesen and his wife Jill are familiar with Long's videos.  They support his efforts and say crimes like these are part of a bigger problem here. 
[00:23:30]  This is basically what we deal with every day.  And for it to happen in the shower...  Move, you poor fuck.  ...in the courthouse is a bit ridiculous, in my opinion.  And that couple we talked with say someone assaulted them just around the corner from  where we are on Martin Luther King on Thursday.  Of course they did.  Martin Luther King.  The Atlanta police charged both women from those videos with disorderly conduct.  The woman from the Taser video was also charged with criminal trespass, contributing to  the delinquency of a minor and simple battery.  We're live in downtown Atlanta.  Simple battery.  Simple battery.  ...in the military, Channel 2 to Action News. 
[00:24:00]  Once again, the news.  Fucking hate the news.  They don't show the actual Tase.  Well, no.  No.  Why not?  It's news.  That was a good one.  That was a great one.  Why not?  They'll show other shit.  Oh, does she topple?  It was great.  You said she fell over like a Barbie doll.  Yeah.  Oh, I loved it.  Yeah, this guy's got a fucking GoPro right on him.  He's got a following.  I guess Reddit set up a forum to raise money for this guy.  To get him fucking Kevlar. 
[00:24:30]  To get him some more body armor.  Oh, that's what they're going for?  Yeah.  He wears it though, right?  Yeah, he wears a bulletproof vest, but they want to get him a better one.  A better one, I guess.  Shush that guy up like RoboCop.  Oh, he should be.  Looking for me.  How much would it be?  I don't know.  Let's do it.  Yeah, we should say.  How much is...  We'll buy the helmet.  A fucking Kevlar.  He looks like a stormtrooper.  But if they get him, he has a firearm though.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Is he an ex-cop?  I don't know what the fuck the criteria is to be a security guard in Atlanta. 
[00:25:00]  I would assume you have to be a fucking Navy SEAL.  It's just that whole neighborhood.  It just looks like it's a constant battle to keep the perimeter.  Here's my prediction with this guy.  To keep the perimeter.  It's crazy.  He will eventually be killed doing this in a movie we made about him.  Yes.  And we'll be sad.  There you go.  And we'll go, oh, remember that guy?  It'll be kind of like an Omar situation.  Once again, we'll be going...  Here's what we're going to do.  Replay the thing where Jimmy says that this guy's going to be killed.  And then they'll replay me saying this.  Because this will be pertinent too. 
[00:25:30]  And then what I just said will also be...  It'll be like a grittier Paul Blart.  Yes.  Paul Blart.  That's hilarious.  This is Paul motherfucking Blart.  That's right.  The fucking reboot where they take a comedy and make it a drama.  They really bulk up the character.  Lamar Blart.  Oh, that's funny.  Boy, is this guy a fucking... 
[00:26:00]  But Travis paused it while we were talking and just happened to catch the guy.  Yeah.  In like a pause.  That face was...  And you realize, oh, those glasses are probably protective glasses.  Yeah, I bet.  So you can't get mazed or something.  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  By the way.  By the way.  I don't think they're trying to do a bit.  A lot of people are wondering if we're fucking around with the Ed Koch announcement.  No, unfortunately we're not.  Oh, the mayor.  Ed Koch, the mayor of New York City from back in the day, died at the age of 88 overnight.  Dead mayor.  People are thinking.  There's like five calls coming in and a few tweets already. 
[00:26:30]  And I'm sure some are just goofing, but whatever.  It's real.  So that guy rules.  Mall Robocop rules.  Mall Robocop.  But now people know his name.  See, the problem is now people know his name.  And he shouldn't have uploaded that stuff to YouTube unless he wanted to get that on record with these were guys that...  I don't know how that goes with World Star Hip Hop.  It might end up...  I mean, it's obviously from his GoPro, so...  Good quality. 
[00:27:00]  Someone had to take that and put it up on World Star.  It might end up where it's like, he said that that's one of his best weapons is the camera.  Or it might end up where people will be like, I don't want to fuck with this guy because I don't want my face...  I'm a drug dealer splashed all over the fucking internet.  Doesn't mean they won't kill this guy.  Oh, he's dead man walking right there.  All you gotta do is find out where he lives.  I mean, you know what I mean?  And he's a tough guy, but these guys are also crazy fucks.  Yeah.  He's gotta be on his guard now fucking all the time.  Oh, so the interaction... 
[00:27:30]  Did you see the whole video where he's interacting with this...  He throws these guys out of this Asian place.  And he's telling the guy...  And the one guy is ready to fight him in the street.  Oh, yeah.  But he won't let the guy walk away.  You know how when both two guys are talking shit and you can tell that they could walk away without a fight.  They both just gotta keep their manhood.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  He won't let this drug dealer walk away as an equal.  Yeah, he's calling...  The drug dealer's calling him a hoe.  He goes, you a hoe!  You a hoe!  He goes, come on, man to man! 
[00:28:00]  Let's go visit!  Let's play this.  Fuck it.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  What are you doing?  What?  I'm asking you.  What are you doing?  I ain't doing nothing.  Selling drugs.  What do you think?  What's in that pocket, dog?  What's in my pocket?  Nothing in my pocket.  Better money.  I ain't got nothing in my pocket.  This is in an Asian camera place across the street from the mall.  Thank you, fool.  Don't let those drugs over here, man.  She's out.  We know.  We know.  We can't do that.  So he has to walk out and scold them.  You want him to stay out?  You tell me.  I'll walk across the street. 
[00:28:30]  And promptly remove him.  No, that's why I said it.  It's like he's in fucking Fallujah.  I didn't bring my phone today, unfortunately.  Yeah.  So now he's walking back outside.  All of them, you want to stay out of here?  All of them?  No.  Do you want them all to stay out of here?  Just tell me now.  He's not nervous at all.  No.  Just help us out there.  So obvious.  Dude, I work for the company.  Okay.  He's unafraid of these guys.  Totally.  Yeah.  Now he's...  Hey, I'm going to have to stay out that doorway. 
[00:29:00]  Approaching him.  Yeah, nah, man.  Hell yeah.  Man, who are you talking to, man?  I'm talking to you, nigga.  Get out of my face.  You better stay out this doorway.  I don't need no doorway.  Fuck you, Tom.  You better stay out of that doorway, nigga.  Hey, fuck you, Tom.  I'm right here, nigga.  You better the fuck out of my face, man.  I'm in your fucking face.  You better stay out that doorway.  He better watch out.  Hold my...  What you gonna do, nigga?  I'm telling you, buddy.  What you gonna do, nigga?  He's not what you want.  This is...  Hey, nigga.  I'm standing here.  So I must warn you.  Stay out the doorway.  He's not what you want.  Stay out the doorway.  Stay out the doorway. 
[00:29:30]  No, I ain't you.  Stay out the doorway.  Stay out the building.  I went in the building or the doorway.  Fuck you.  And I'm telling you, nigga.  Fuck you, you a bitch.  Why you better watch out, homie?  What you gonna do, nigga?  I'm a bitch.  I'm standing here, nigga.  Do something.  They sure hate that word, don't they?  You got a lot of mouth, nigga, but you ain't got no motherfucking heart.  Take your cameras off and your belt. Let's get in this street. That's what you do.  Shit, nigga, we don't get the cameras off.  Take your cameras off and your belt. Let's get in this street.  Nigga, we in the street. 
[00:30:00]  Take your cameras off and let's get in this street.  He's falling out with a baton. He's dual wielding two batons.  Stay out the doorway, man.  I messed the boat.  I ain't standing on that, boy.  I swear, I ain't saying none of this.  Do what you gotta do, nigga.  Do what you gotta do, nigga.  They're chest to chest.  Don't stand behind me, boy.  You a bitch, boy.  I'm here, nigga.  You a ho, nigga.  You ain't gonna do that.  You ain't gonna do, man.  Fuck what you talking about, nigga.  Stay out this doorway.  You too.  Get out the doorway.  Fuck what you talking about, nigga.  Get out the doorway.  You a ho, boy.  It's like eight, ten guys fucking gaggle. 
[00:30:30]  Nigga, you ain't standing in this doorway.  I'm telling you what the fuck is going on.  No, nigga, you not standing in this doorway.  I was standing in this doorway from the get-go.  What the fuck you talking about?  Whole-ass, nigga.  Understand what the fuck I'm telling you.  Whole-ass, nigga.  You gonna stay out the doorway?  Come on.  You gonna stay out the doorway?  You gonna stay out the doorway?  You gonna stay out the doorway?  What the fuck you talking about, nigga?  You gonna stay out this doorway?  You gonna swagger, swagger.  Just swagger real quick just to get-  You understand what the fuck I'm telling you?  There's literally like fucking nine guys out there, and they walked out into the street.  That's where he's going. 
[00:31:00]  We're in the street.  Right.  And then some guy kind of, they came around him, and he's like, don't stand behind me, boy.  Yeah, yeah.  And the guy fucking, he's backing off all of these guys.  Uh-huh.  It's amazing.  That camera's really powerful.  Then again, it's daylight.  That's probably what's saving his life.  Daylight, he's a camera.  Yes.  In the end, they're gonna get to this guy.  Oh, they will get him.  And they will take over this area again.  They will kill him.  Although I didn't know he was armed.  The fact that he has a taser and a pistol and Kevlar makes him very dangerous.  This motherfucker, though, it's like fucking zombies and shit. 
[00:31:30]  Or, you know, I am legend.  He's I am legend.  He's fucking Will Smith.  Because the second night falls, these guys ain't gonna back off.  They will fucking blindside this motherfucker, at the very least.  At the most, they'll fucking gun him down, and he will be dead.  But do you know what?  I figured watching this, because there's this really weird dynamic with him and these guys.  Like, they are chest bumping.  Yeah.  But there's a really weird rhythm with this interaction that they understand each other. 
[00:32:00]  Like, they understand where each other is at every moment in the argument.  And I think these things go wrong a lot, which is why somebody just gets shot in the street.  But I don't understand that world.  If a guy was yelling at me like that, like, either one of them, I'd be like, ah, I'm a dead man.  Oh, yeah.  No one understands this world.  Yeah.  They do.  This is a problem.  This is a fucking problem that will never be fixed.  But he's taking on, like, a dozen of them.  Yeah, yeah.  That's great.  He does everything that you wish you could do.  Well, they don't know if that camera's live, either. 
[00:32:30]  No, I don't.  Like, nobody wants to fucking be on camera without shooting a security guard.  Yeah, right?  That's true.  He better not have a camera on his back.  Yeah.  I wonder if he does.  They'll probably just kill him and then just rip the fucking camera off of him.  But they don't know where it goes.  Don't destroy the SD card.  It's so sad.  We all know this guy's going to have a major problem down the road.  Oh, yeah.  Let's see how the rest of the video goes.  Fire the fuck, boy!  You understand what I'm telling you? 
[00:33:00]  You not allowed on this property.  You not allowed on this property.  You come back on this property.  You come back on this property.  You come back on that property.  Nigga, you already got the issue.  Fuck you, Tomat.  You gonna stay off.  You gonna stay off.  You gonna stay off.  All you goddamn drug dealers are gonna stay off this property.  I don't sell drugs, hoe nigga.  Fuck you, Tomat.  Nigga, you sell drugs every day in the fucking week.  This is where I'm standing out. 
[00:33:30]  I'm standing here.  Please isolate that.  Please isolate that for every time someone in management walks in. 
[00:34:00]  Yeah, we need that clip no matter what.  Dude, is that the greatest clip?  Yes, we'll put it to good use.  Oh, my God.  This absolutely reminds me of the time somebody tried to walk into one of the stores in the Manhasset Mall, the Miracle Mile,  and one of the security guards asked him to please leave that outside.  It's exactly like it.  Yeah, sure.  Manhasset Mall.  This is another country to me.  It's another world.  It's fucking, it's somewhere in a third world nation. 
[00:34:30]  And both sides know that they haven't really crossed the line.  Right.  Because if you cross the line, then you would see the fist fight or some kind of major altercation, right?  Yeah.  They both understand that neither one has actually fucking crossed the line.  Yeah, because they haven't, no one has raised their hands technically and threw a punch.  Holy shit.  Or maybe they, the guy absolutely crossed the line, but this guy knows he can't do shit because of the camera.  Yeah, but that's what I mean by understanding that rhythm.  It's like there's something, I'm trying to, like, I've heard, you ever hear, like, when you hear foreign videos of, like, Muslim guys yelling at each other, oh, no, no, no, no, no, no. 
[00:35:00]  But there's, like, Noam told me, he was in Egypt one time, and him and his wife went in on their honeymoon, and he said, the bus got stopped.  Why would you do that?  Believe me, dude.  Why would you do that?  I don't get it.  And the guy has a lot of money.  Why would you do that?  He said the bus got stopped or something.  Of course it did.  And they were, the Egyptian was yelling at the driver or something, but he goes, when they talk to each other, they yell.  And he goes, they were screaming, oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. 
[00:35:30]  But they understood each other, and everything was fine, and he wasn't nervous.  His wife was panicking, but he was fine.  But there's a really weird rhythm people have that it's just what is scary to us.  Like, you know how we feel watching that?  That's how they feel watching two guys.  We're going to have to agree to disagree.  Yeah, yeah.  I don't know about that.  I'll call my attorney.  When they hear that, they both push away from the table.  Their hands are sweating.  Oh, shit.  He said, please. 
[00:36:00]  At what point would Whitey have a problem in this situation?  Holy shit.  How long ago?  How long ago?  Right from the get-go.  The second that Asian guy said that he wants them out, the white guy would be like, well, let's call the authorities.  Shut up.  Hello, police?  We need to tank him.  Yeah, apparently there's a police station right around the corner from this, too, but they still need the security guards.  They still need the security guy out there racking some head.  Yeah, obviously hired by a private company.  Yeah.  All right, get to the part where the Blackhawk helicopter crashes in the street. 
[00:36:30]  Yeah, let's see what this is.  Every day in a fucking week.  Nigga, you're hurting your goddamn drug deal.  But I'm done with the conversation.  I'm done with the conversation.  I'm done with the conversation.  Nigga, this is where I'm standing out.  I'm standing here.  I'm doing all that extra shit.  Talking to niggas I ain't need.  Studying on door where shit.  You said nigga do shit.  Talk to the nigga you said do something.  Fuck you, Tom.  Hit the bricks, nigga.  Poor ass.  Hit the bricks, nigga.  You a hoe, bro.  I'm telling you.  Hit the bricks, nigga. 
[00:37:00]  Hit the shit, be like you today.  I'm telling you.  Come on and give me.  Come on and give it to me.  Whoever want to stand up, come on and give it to me.  Oh, shit.  Whoever want to stand up, come on and give it to me.  I got it for you today.  I got it for you today.  Come on, nigga.  Stand up.  Stand up.  Stand up.  Come on.  I'm standing here.  Come on.  Give me what I'm looking for.  I'm looking for you to kill me. 
[00:37:30]  I'm looking for you to kill me.  Give me what I'm looking for.  Oh, boy.  Come on.  I hear a lot of people talking, but I don't see a lot of people moving.  You're going to be missing.  Okay.  That's not a problem.  We got you.  Who else want to stand up?  They're all filming.  Y'all going to stay off this property, too.  Come on this property and find out what's up.  Come on this property and find out what's up. 
[00:38:00]  Come on this property and find out what's up.  That's what I thought.  They're talking a lot, but you ain't coming on the property.  Show me you got these hands, nigga.  Take your kid off of that fight like mad, nigga.  Fuck you talking about, nigga.  You a hoe.  You a hoe.  I'm telling you.  You a hoe.  Fuck you talking about, boy.  You a real hoe.  Take your shit out of that fight like mad.  No pistol, no gun, no neck.  Straight your hands, nigga.  Just to let people know what's happening.  The guy is.  Wow.  The guy stopped talking because he's just showing his hand like this. 
[00:38:30]  Like, go ahead.  Step into the store.  Step up.  Right here.  Step right there.  Right over that line.  Go ahead.  Stop yelling and step over that line.  He's just.  Holy fuck.  All you see is the security guard's right arm in a gesture of pointing down.  Yeah.  And that guy is not fucking stepping past the line.  Are you learning over here?  Absolutely.  Because this is how you.  Yeah, never go to Atlanta.  Yeah.  This is how you deal with your mother, Mars.  This is how you deal with your mother.  You tell her to hit the bricks.  Hit the bricks, nigga.  Hit the bricks, nigga. 
[00:39:00]  Burn the hands, nigga.  Burn the hands with a spatula, nigga.  Oh, man.  You'll love this, huh, Mars?  It's a great video.  The Metro Mall.  That place looks great.  I just wanted to show people what was happening because you can't see it at home, obviously.  But he is literally.  That guy is fucking.  That drug dealer would kill him if he could.  Oh, man.  But he is not crossing that line, which happens to be a shadow.  He's not moving past.  I like J.J. Evans over there with the fucking orange sneakers on.  Holy shit. 
[00:39:30]  And what a fucking tall, skinny motherfucker he is.  Yep.  He's a problem, too.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  I think he starts giving him a little shit.  One minute left.  All right.  One minute.  Yay.  Hey, you bitch.  You a hoe, boy.  He wants him to fight with his hands.  Tell you, boy, I bought none.  Boy, you a hoe.  You gonna stay off this property.  All of you gonna stay off this property.  Believe that.  You on the property.  Fuck you talking about.  I ain't gonna stay nowhere. 
[00:40:00]  I go in there and buy my seat.  No, you ain't going in here.  The man don't want you in here.  The man don't want you in here.  No, but the man told me.  You a hoe, nigga, stow.  Fuck you talking about.  Why don't we come out of this stow, nigga?  We been out here, boy.  I don't give a fuck where you been.  You're not coming on here no more.  Better stop playing, boy.  I ain't playing.  You think I'm playing?  Come on up here.  You a hoe.  You think I'm playing?  Come on up here.  Why you keep stepping back, nigga?  Come out here.  Oh, you gotta come on my property, baby.  You gotta come on.  Come on.  Come on, dog.  Whatever you want to do, player. 
[00:40:30]  Whatever play.  Hey, man, I hear you talking.  You coming on this property?  You coming on this property?  Because I hear you talking.  Oh, man.  I hear you talking.  I hear you talking.  See, now the guy moves away a little bit.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  And then that's the end of the video.  That's gotta be it, yeah.  But there's a few times this could have been diffused,  but this guy wanted to...  This guy's a fucking rage-a-holic.  Right?  And he's just...  He likes it a little too much, I think. 
[00:41:00]  Yeah, he's almost...  But again, it didn't get physical,  so he may know that you...  What's this now?  Come on.  I want to look for other videos, but I don't know.  Oh, okay.  Tragedy today at the Metro Mall in downtown Atlanta  when a popular viral video security guard  was gunned down.  We take you now to Botswana,  where we will show you  what looks exactly like the scene we saw earlier.  A man many saw as a role model.  Yes. 
[00:41:30]  He wasn't gonna take it.  And his replacement is gonna let them do it.  Oh, my God.  He tried to change a neighborhood,  and it cost him his life.  Oh, man.  Isn't it sad that we just know how this story's gonna end?  Oh, of course we do.  As a society, we just know.  Oh, man.  Interesting tweet.  This is absolutely why we still need Patrice in this world  so he can explain this to us.  I know!  Patrice would have a good explanation for this.  Oh, if you have a take on that.  About why this fucking guy's doing that. 
[00:42:00]  There was something we were doing the other day,  and I looked right to your left  where Patrice usually sat  and just visualized him being here.  It was just a weird moment I had.  Probably some kind of fun  that we were just like,  God, he would ruin this.  He would have explained  that fight between that verbal exchange  between those two guys.  He would have explained exactly what that was.  He would have said,  Oh, man, that's nothing.  The dynamic between them.  He's like,  Yeah, see, that motherfucker,  what he's thinking,  and it would have all made sense. 
[00:42:30]  Like, oh, okay.  I'm enlightened now.  Leaning back.  Yeah, yeah.  See, that nigga,  he fucking,  he's the one that...  And then he'd point something out  that we didn't even see.  Like, now you see the guy on the right?  You see him?  Now he's the motherfucker that...  He always had...  Yeah, always had such a unique take.  Yes.  Yeah, well, that's the way  he takes his gum out.  Like, it would have been something  that none of us noticed.  Yeah, none of us would have seen  and then you're like,  Oh, fuck, he's right.  Patrice would have...  The niggas chew in orbit.  Oh, okay. 
[00:43:00]  When he explained we only needed,  like, six states,  and at first we're like,  this is the dumbest thing ever,  but by the end of it,  we were all in.  It made perfect sense.  It made perfect sense.  Or he'd totally fucking blow it up,  like,  That motherfucker's in on the drug dealers.  He's protecting the drug dealers,  motherfucker.  And you'd be like,  Holy fuck.  And then he'd, like, say,  Why?  Like, they have the fight,  it's on video,  but he's actually at night,  he's the guy that protects him.  Like, he would have it all spelled out.  Yeah, maybe he's just getting rid  of his competition. 
[00:43:30]  Yeah.  But if we ask somebody else  to explain,  like another guy,  like, say a guy from Shade,  who interviews a lot of rappers,  they wouldn't give us...  Like, we'll get a guy in,  like, what do you think?  He'll just go,  Oh, man, he's crazy.  And then walk back out.  Crazy motherfucker.  Yeah, Patrice would have it  all fucking spelled out.  It'd be great.  Yeah, that would have been great.  I can't understand that.  I mean, two guys yelling at each other?  Yeah.  But fucking backing off  that many guys who really 
[00:44:00]  are probably guys who don't play games.  It is such a black thing.  That exchange,  you do not see that often  in a white environment.  You see guys going at each other,  but truth of the matter is,  they would have either stopped  or fought a lot quicker.  That was something...  That's something that is  very exclusive  to the black community.  Why has Atlanta decided 
[00:44:30]  to just kind of give up on that area?  A downtown mall like that?  That area is...  I mean, because that's obviously  a private security guy.  It's a dime a dozen areas like that.  You can go to any city.  Fucking Detroit,  that shit's happening everywhere.  Chicago and some of those bad areas.  Atlanta's trying to reinvent themselves.  They're trying to get...  I know because I got a nephew down there.  They're trying to get downtown going again.  Yeah, good luck there  because the old fucking Metro mall  doesn't seem to be changing very much. 
[00:45:00]  The old Metro.  This would be a great day.  I wish 50 Cent was in today  because he understands that world  from the other point of view.  I would love to ask him  from your point of view,  what is that guy doing?  Well, we could ask DJ who can...  Oh, that's right, we can.  He got arrested last night.  What?  Did he really?  No.  I guess he did.  Who can...  What happened?  I thought it was a joke, but...  That's what I thought.  It was a work.  Our pal DJ who can...  Maybe Sam knows.  Got arrested.  He would explain this shit.  Here comes Sam.  Is he still in jail?  Is this a work?  I don't think it is. 
[00:45:30]  He hasn't...  I talked to...  Child support, right?  I talked to a cop buddy of mine.  Yeah?  Is that really DJ who, kid?  Yeah, that's him.  That doesn't look like him.  It doesn't look like him.  That's him.  He was wearing...  Oh, man.  He usually wears...  It's a work.  Sunglasses or something?  What's different about him?  He usually wears a hat.  Yeah, he's got a wool hat on  instead of a ball cap.  Arrested outside G-Unit records.  Eh, maybe.  I mean, is that for child support?  No.  I don't know what it's for.  Assault? 
[00:46:00]  I think he's still locked up  because he hasn't read my text message.  You know, you can see on an iPhone  if somebody's read your message.  But if it...  Rumor has it was a suspended license.  They don't keep you locked up  that long for a suspended license?  If it's revoked,  they'll keep you overnight.  And he was driving?  Was he in his vehicle?  That looks like...  Is it Escalade right there?  Yeah, that's what he drives.  Yeah, motherfucker.  But who took the picture?  How do we all know  that he got arrested?  The hip-hop police.  The hip-hop police got him?  I mean, he's pretty well known. 
[00:46:30]  Is he?  Yeah.  I guess he is, right?  He's got, like, 225,000 followers.  That's cute, man.  That's cute.  What, uh...  And it's a real...  I mean, it's a real cop uniform.  It's not like a cop's gonna do  a photo op in his uniform  while he's on duty.  No, I believe it.  He'll be frowned upon.  Arrested for that is nothing.  Unless he wants to bang a chick  behind his wife's back  so he had a friend do that.  A suspended license?  You could get in trouble for that  if your tickets are piled up,  they'll arrest you.  They will arrest you, yeah, yeah.  Why is he still in jail, though?  If it's...  Maybe it was revoked 
[00:47:00]  and not suspended him.  Even so,  you fucking post nothing  for bail for that.  Yeah, I think so.  Do you have warrants?  My buddy told me  they will keep you overnight.  To find a weapon  in his vehicle?  I wouldn't think he has a weapon.  Got a trap in there?  He's always...  He's made it very clear  on the show before  that he's pussy,  so I wouldn't think he has.  Put the weapon in the trap,  you hit the fucking cruise control,  you tap the ashtray,  you fucking pull out  the fucking defroster,  and the goddamn hatch opens.  You got your nine in there, yo.  This was real life.  What?  Not a film.  Oh.  Yeah.  Oh, I thought it was a movie.  No.  Oh. 
[00:47:30]  They have the traps  in the real car, though.  Turn on your windshield wipers,  you turn your steering wheel  halfway to the right,  you fucking put your seat back,  you tap the dashboard,  you open up your vent  a quarter of the way,  and the trap opens up,  and you pull out  your fucking Uzi.  I drove to the airport  with him one time,  and I was smashing  on a whole bunch of stuff  in his car,  and no guns came out.  Really?  I was trying to ruin his car.  You blow in the exhaust pipe,  you turn the valve stem  three-quarters of the way off?  Yeah?  I didn't try that.  You bang on the water  fucking pump?  You didn't know the combination, 
[00:48:00]  that's all.  What are you doing?  I tried.  Of course you do.  What?  I didn't see any firearms  in his vehicle.  I don't think they are.  Twist your gas cap  three-quarters of the way?  Oh.  No?  I'm almost sure not.  All right, well,  if you hear from Who Kid,  let us know.  We sure are celebrating  Black History Month  in fashion today.  That's right.  Opening up Black History Month  with fucking Who Kid being arrested  and some poor-ass security guard  that's going to be dead  any minute now.  Shit.  Fuck you, Tom.  Get the bricks, nigga. 
[00:48:30]  Oh, man.  Get the bricks.  That's such a funny thing to say.  Oh, it's so funny.  It's so definitive.  There's really no way  to interpret that  as anything but get out of here.  Yeah.  We have one more.  I know we did a lot,  but we have one more video  if you guys ever want to watch it.  How about we take a break  and we'll do another video  from this guy?  I could watch this guy  the way you watch  a Twilight Zone marathon.  I could watch this guy all day.  And also,  someone on Twitter  has turned me on  to the fact that  the news is disgusting again.  There was a shooting down there  in, what, 
[00:49:00]  a middle school or something?  In Georgia, Atlanta, right?  Yeah, in Atlanta.  And the news is, like,  really fucking twisting it  and fucking just having,  you know,  their fun with it.  That's funny.  I haven't seen anything about it  because no one died.  Yeah, it wasn't important enough  for anyone.  They love a big body count  and then they'll go with the,  you know,  around-the-clock coverage.  And then we were on the news  in Tampa.  Did anyone ever figure that out?  Yeah, it was a Bubba.  It was a Bubba story  about the trial  that they had.  And they were showing other, 
[00:49:30]  like, shock jocks.  So they showed us  and it was like,  they told a mayor's daughter  that their father was dead.  God, they're still talking about it.  And they totally get it wrong.  We never said that.  That's what they said.  Why can't they get  the basic facts right?  Well, Opie,  they don't have much time  to research it.  It's only been 17 years.  Has it been 17?  I don't know.  What are we up to?  Whatever it is.  Whatever.  And then they showed  Ron and Fez.  Wait, they actually said that?  Yeah.  What fucking scumbags?  Because they wanted  to make it worse.  I know.  Exactly. 
[00:50:00]  It was bad enough,  wasn't it?  Right.  We never told his daughter.  What are they talking about?  Wait, is Bubba  still being sued by Hulk?  Can we sue them?  I don't think so.  I would love to sue  a news outlet.  Eric knows all about it.  And then they said  two people actually sued  their employer or something  and they were showing  Ron and Fez.  Ron and Fez sued their employer?  I don't know.  The guy was just showing  fucking radio people  and accusing them of things.  Wait, what the fuck?  I know.  Let's sue these fuckers.  Sue everyone. 
[00:50:30]  Punitive damage is here.  Holy fuck.  How can they get  this shit wrong?  Where is this?  I want to hear this clip  before we go to break.  It's the Bubba thing.  The Bubba story.  It was on their website yesterday.  Oh, boy.  Remember the guy  that used to work here  that was good on the computer?  Remember that?  Remember the guy  that used to work here  and he was on the computer  and he used to be able  to find things?  Although, you know,  wasn't he very good  at speaking to the boss?  He was also awesome at pranks. 
[00:51:00]  Awesome at pranks.  A banana my Danny Ross.  Danny Ross sleeps  with the unemployed.  They probably got rid of it  because they probably  got everything wrong.  Oh, maybe.  Here it is.  Ah, there it is.  I want to hear this.  Let's see what the story is here.  And it's about a lot of radio guys.  Play it for me if I'm not.  The bulk of it is about  the Bubba trial  against, um...  Who was it? 
[00:51:30]  I thought you just found it.  Oh, not Hulk Hogan.  No, that was something.  No.  Todd Schnitt.  Todd Schnitt.  Oh, that guy  who we had the issues with.  Yeah, yeah.  Here we go.  He was being sued  for the worst name  they were fighting over?  It's like three minutes.  I can just fast forward  to where I start  talking about you guys.  God, what is this?  First, we have a commercial.  Well, it's a radio thing,  so yeah, let's listen  to all three minutes  because you know  it's going to just be shit  we can relate to in there.  Yes, exactly.  Well, the Florida State Fair  coming up.  Yeah.  All right, thanks.  Now, this shock jock trial. 
[00:52:00]  Shock jock trial.  The love sponge here.  A lot to brag about, didn't it?  But his rival, M.J.,  Todd Schnitt,  who sued Bubba,  found out what free speech means.  But it turned into  a sideshow, didn't it?  It dragged in  the state attorney,  Mark Ober,  and the Tampa police  through some legal mud  before a judge stopped it  after a paralegal  who worked for  the defense law firm  had drinks at Malio's  with M.J.'s attorney,  Phil Campbell,  and convinced Campbell  to drive her car  and then he got picked up  for DUI.  That's a great story.  After somebody  from the defense law firm 
[00:52:30]  called police.  Well, Campbell said  they set him up.  The Tampa police officer  said he was used,  but the judge refused  to declare a mistrial  after he said  the defense team  and the defense law firm  are two different things.  Well, I suspect  we've not heard  the last of that.  The law firm's involvement  could be the subject  of a bar investigation.  By the way,  the plaintiff here,  M.J.,  is not on the top ten list  of offensive jocks.  However,  his legal target,  Bubba,  certainly is.  After Bubba's pig stunt 
[00:53:00]  some years ago,  M.J. made his wife  an issue  by putting her  on his show  and thus took away  her protection  as a private citizen.  When Bubba called her,  well,  something on the air  that rhymes with boar.  Whore!  You can say whore  a s'more!  He called her a chore!  Al Gore!  A s'more!  A delicious treat!  A cunt!  Doesn't rhyme.  They are by nature  an unpredictable lot.  They are hired  to push our buttons  with rude behavior  and personal insults. 
[00:53:30]  And their audiences  here in the Tabbler area  total hundreds  of thousands a week.  Their advertisers  pay $200 to $300  a minute  to be on their shows.  And Bubba's stock here,  it just went up.  The shockers  are known for some  outrageous stunts  across the country.  One aggravated commuters  in a major city  by blocking a freeway  to cut somebody's hair.  Another convinced  the daughter of a mayor  that her father  had been killed  at a car wreck.  Pause.  I ain't letting  that fucking pass.  Who's this guy?  Fuck you.  Fuck you. 
[00:54:00]  We never convinced  the daughter  that her father  had died.  We never fucking  convinced anybody.  I want to force this guy  to make a fucking  statement and an apology.  Fuck you.  I want a retraction.  No, fuck you.  We didn't do that.  The stunt itself  was bad.  We didn't fucking  talk to his daughter.  We wouldn't do that.  Wish we would have.  I'm not trying to act  like an altar boy here,  but if you're going  to do the fucking news,  get the basic facts right.  Yeah.  Blocking a freeway  to cut somebody's hair.  Another convinced 
[00:54:30]  the daughter  of a mayor  that her father  had been killed  at a car wreck.  Pause again.  How do we get a hold  of this guy?  Does he have  a Facebook page  or something?  I want our listeners  to fucking set  this guy straight.  Convinced?  So that means  we found her number  is what he's  basically saying.  Yeah,  it definitely  misleads people  into thinking  we did something else.  The only thing  is he never  says who we are.  He's just showing  pictures behind himself. 
[00:55:00]  He never said  Opie and Anthony.  Right.  So there's nothing  we can do about it.  If his daughter was listening,  then you can  if the daughter  was listening.  So technically  she said she was convinced  if she ever did.  But that wasn't the prank.  He definitely  is misleading people.  Of course he is.  And that's what  the news does.  Right.  I definitely want  to at least  point that out.  Because he also says  Ron Fez sued people.  I don't know  what the fuck that is.  Yeah, let's continue.  I'm sorry.  A woman jock  who plays sounds  during her show  that she says  is staff members  having sex  with each other.  Howard Stern  became legendary 
[00:55:30]  for using sexual terms.  A lot of them do now.  But as far as I can determine,  two sued their station  for firing them.  A listener sued one,  but none of the top ten  shot jocks  has ever sued a riot.  Two sued their station  for firing them.  And that was Ron Fez.  This section was an embarrassment  to everybody involved.  Is that it?  The jury essentially said  MJ crossed the line  by using the legal system  to get back at his competitor  and is due not one dime.  We saw two media giants here  and promoters of free speech  fighting it out in court  over what they have said 
[00:56:00]  about each other  on the radio.  Free speech won.  Thankfully, this is over.  And MJ is about to get  a very big bill.  That's my view.  What finally happened?  All right, so it's  John.Wilson at FoxTV.com.  What a horrible piece  because he's talking  about shock jocks  and then he brings  Rana Fez in  for suing their bosses  for being fired.  You don't know why  they were fired  and maybe they had  a good case.  Maybe.  This guy stinks.  What finally happened  with the case? 
[00:56:30]  Who won?  I guess Bubba won, right?  Yeah, Bubba won.  It was like a free speech thing.  But there's only so much  like that only goes  for so long  because I think in Chicago  Steve Dahl sued Mancow,  I believe,  because Steve Dahl's wife  used to be on the show  with him.  But Mancow had said something  and she had been off  the show long enough  where the courts  I think said  that you can no longer  consider her a public figure  because her time  in the public eye  was so long ago.  It's like waiting  and having your hymen  grow back.  You're a virgin again. 
[00:57:00]  Oh yeah,  or like let's just say  that your hat gets  blown off in the wind  that all of a sudden  one day your hat  will be back on.  And then you have  a hat again.  Yeah, of course.  I think that's...  Yeah, well...  Yeah, she settled  with Mancow.  What finally happened?  Janet Dahl,  the wife of the city's  most controversial...  Settled down.  Today settled her defamation  suit against the city's  other most outrageous host,  Mancow.  In her original suit,  Janet Dahl asked for  more than five million  in damages,  each from Mueller,  WKQX, 
[00:57:30]  and its owner,  Emmis.  That's it.  No, but with Bubba,  what happened?  Like what had been said  about the wife?  It's long and complicated.  It's a whole bunch of shit.  Oh, it wasn't just  one incident?  No, no, a whole bunch of shit.  Mueller referred to her  on the air as a slut  and a whore who engaged  in bizarre sexual conduct.  Oh, wow, yeah.  Mueller claimed that  Janet Dahl was a public figure  because of her high profile  on her husband's radio show.  And then they basically  didn't agree. 
[00:58:00]  The court said  nerds to you.  Yes.  Okay.  Stupid news, though.  Fucking dumbass.  Fucking...  They are fucking  just deceptive.  It's just a dopey  old fucking news guy  that doesn't have  any concept of  how this type of radio works  to begin with.  It brings me to  yesterday I saw  the guy had to be 80,  some congressman,  I think,  or senator  trying to discuss...  Senator!  Trying to discuss 
[00:58:30]  violent video games  down there in Washington  yesterday.  Oh, boy.  Yeah.  And you're looking at the guy,  he probably has never  played a video game  in his life.  He doesn't know what he is.  So how is he an expert  on this?  Violent pong.  That's what he's talking about.  Violent pong.  Look, if you can have  the discussion,  I'm all for having  these discussions,  but get the right people  involved.  Not some old fucking,  you know,  politician that obviously  has no fucking clue  about it.  Yeah. 
[00:59:00]  Unbelievable how  out of touch.  If they're not out of touch,  they're just lying.  Yeah, yeah.  The news just fucking  lies in general.  Or they kind of  make it vague  to make it worse.  Was it Senator  Chuck Grassley?  That guy right there?  I remember seeing  an even older guy.  How old is he?  Whatever.  I mean, you know,  it's an obvious point.  I mean, we all see  the people that are  talking about video games  are the ones that  looks like him, yeah. 
[00:59:30]  What video game  has he played?  Probably Pong.  Pong, yeah.  Maybe Zelda?  Maybe.  Maybe Zelda.  They were going after  our pals Rockstar yesterday.  He rocked like Zelda.  Oh, yeah.  Eric loves Zelda.  What's Zelda?  What's the best  video game ever made?  What's Zelda?  One of the hottest  video games of all time.  Oh, my God.  Best video games ever.  I would beg to differ,  but...  The original one?  The original Zelda?  Best game ever.  What platform 
[01:00:00]  do you play that on?  Nintendo.  Really?  Nintendo what?  The original Nintendo.  Original Nintendo.  Are you still  playing the original Nintendo?  You still have it,  but I'm saying  that is the best game ever.  You still have  the fucking original?  I still have it, yeah.  Of course you do.  I still have mine.  It's cool.  You know what?  I never understand that  because you could  obviously get all those  games online  in some way, shape, or form.  You get emulators and stuff.  Yeah.  But then you don't  blow on the thing.  The cartridge.  You're pushing it up and down.  You put the cartridge in. 
[01:00:30]  Oh, remember that?  Yeah.  I forgot about that.  Hang on.  Dammit.  This sucks.  It's...  I have all those  old game systems  just sitting in bins  that I haven't done  anything with.  Oh, my God.  I can't fucking...  Why would you go back  from like an Xbox  or something?  It's like...  I don't like any  of that old shit.  Do you play games  on your phone?  I mean...  Barely.  You're going back.  I'm an Xbox guy  and computer games.  Well, you're an Xbox  cheater guy.  You're more of a... 
[01:01:00]  Yeah, exactly.  I cheat with my fucking...  my Zim.  But some...  I mean, sometimes  some of the most  simple games  are the best.  Float?  Yeah.  I'm all about to float.  But I'll tell you  one thing.  When I fucking get home,  I am firing up  Call of Duty  on the 90-inch  fucking television  to see what the fuck  that experience is like.  Can we talk about  the 90-inch TV  after the break?  Of course we can.  It was delivered  last night  at about 9 p.m.  A lot of people  asking,  who the fuck  delivers TVs  at 9 p.m.? 
[01:01:30]  Right.  Yeah, that was  a question  that popped up.  E-Rock.  I wanted to point out  re-watching the  Tampa video here.  Yeah.  All the photos  of other DJs  are press shots  or something  involving what  they're doing.  The shot they have  for you  is some fan photo  of you two  doing karaoke.  Is that what it was?  It's not even  an official press shot.  I was wondering  what picture that was.  No, that was  that karaoke joint  on the east side.  And everyone said...  You could see  the research that they did.  And fucking...  Yeah.  We did a tune together. 
[01:02:00]  Horribly.  That's right.  We did Hall & Oates.  We did a Hall & Oates song.  I think it was  Private Eyes.  They're watching you.  I think we did  Private Eyes.  Was that the one?  Yeah.  It was Iggy's, right?  Yeah, Iggy's.  Iggy's.  Good little joint  on the east side.  They actually have  the TVs that like  in bars that  they just flash up  like advertisements  for various things.  I was there one night  and I saw  something about our show.  It was like,  oh, I'll catch  the Opie & Anthony show  on Sirius X  and Celebrity.  Oh, that's pretty cool,  man.  Thank you. 
[01:02:30]  Yeah, yeah.  That's more advertising  than this place gives us.  I know, right?  Fuck.  Why would we want  a picture with Troy Aikman  and a talk to Aikman  on the radio?  Oh, boy.  Why would we?  Is Sam around?  Sam.  Why would we?  After the break,  I want a whole list  of all the shows  just like we did last year.  I know it's going to sound  like the same shit  we did last year,  but we got to do it again.  Okay.  I want a list  of everyone that's down there.  Do we have an answer  from them as to why?  What is their explanation?  Well, it must have  cost too much money.  It must have cost 
[01:03:00]  too much money.  They're obsessed  with us doing a bus tour.  I know that.  So why can't we do both?  Exactly.  We should do both.  How about they get  a sales department  and get sponsorship  for the fucking bus tour?  Now you're talking crazy.  Yeah, I don't know.  I don't know why  it's so hard to sell this show.  They keep telling us  we're doing really well,  but they want to give us  exact numbers,  which has always been  strange to me.  We, as we sit here,  have no fucking idea  how many people listen.  Yeah.  Maybe no one's out there. 
[01:03:30]  Maybe we're just talking  and it's not even being transmitted.  That's why Howard  gets away with murder.  He just tells his fans,  oh, I'm talking  to 20 million people.  Why don't we just say that?  Fine.  Hey, you know,  we're talking to 20 million people  here, for the love of God.  He just says that  and there's no way  to prove it,  so he gets away  with telling people  he talks to 20 million people.  It's not even close to that.  It's less than 2 million.  I know that much.  Which means we're probably  a little over a million.  That's it.  Roland has cited the show  as having 11 million.  Oh, yeah. 
[01:04:00]  Oh, Roland.  Yeah.  Well, we could just say that  because in eight years,  I have no idea.  The Roland ratings.  The best they'll do is go,  you guys are doing really well.  Well, what does that mean?  How many people?  Could you give me  a ballpark number?  They have never done it.  11 million?  I'll go with 11 mil.  Sure.  Sounds good to me.  So, Ants TV after the break.  Yeah, boy.  And a lot of others.  Yeah.  Ants TV.  Oh, you got it.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  The Opinetry Channel 
[01:04:30]  on SiriusXM.  Welcome back to Cock Talk.  I'm Mistress Vixen.  Today, today,  we're talking about  your first man-on-man experience.  We have Mars on the phone  from Puerto Rico.  Mars, talk to me, baby.  I'm a changed man  as of yesterday.  Yeah, I'm a fucking changed man.  I'm not the same. 
[01:05:00]  Mars, I see here  you had your first  gay experience last night.  Yeah.  Yummy.  So, tell me,  what was that little asshole  of yours like  before the big night?  My shit is so tight, man.  I guess I ain't a retentary  It's so tight.  Mmm, sexy.  And what was going  through your head  when you whipped out  that big dick?  He tells me to lie down  on my left side  and I'm facing  a particular direction  and then he pulls  his apparatus out.  I'm like,  hell no, 
[01:05:30]  that shit is not  going near me.  Sure enough,  he goes behind me.  How big was it?  It was, I swear to God,  about two feet long.  Ooh, you're a spicy  little bitch, aren't you?  And what did he say  before he put it in you?  Did he ease it in?  I'm just feeling  for a second  and all of a sudden  this motherfucker  all the way in my ass.  Ooh, you lucky  little taquito.  Tell me more.  He goes like,  he goes like this.  Come on, buddy.  Help me.  Help me here. 
[01:06:00]  Work with me.  Let me do my job.  What was that job?  Open my ass.  I don't know  how you guys do it.  Just letting that  rainbow-striped  freak flag fly.  Come on.  Alcohol.  Alcohol.  This all sounds  so dirty.  How'd you get  cleaned up after?  Did he do it for you?  Yeah, he cleaned it  afterwards.  No, he did it  afterwards in front of me.  No, he did.  Ooh, how did he do that?  Uh, what is it?  Toss salad?  You could toss my salad  anytime.  Ooh, he licked  your asshole clean 
[01:06:30]  with his tongue?  Exactly.  My God, Mars.  You are so naughty.  Any guy would be lucky  to go south  of the border with you.  This is our secret.  Don't tell anybody.  What I wouldn't give  to have a dick sometimes.  Well, tune in next week  when Cock Talk returns  and we talk to guys  about their first time  with a down-low brother,  Mars.  I bet you have a story  like that, don't you?  Yeah.  Ooh, you little Spanish fly.  You've got me all wet. 
[01:07:00]  See you next week  for more Cock Talk.  Cock Talk.  Serious Serious XM  The O.P. and Anthony Show.  Private eyes  They're watching you  They see your every move  I get it.  Private eyes  They're watching you  I get it.  Private eyes  They're watching you  They're watching you 
[01:07:30]  They're watching you  Sam's putting together  the list of people  that went to the Super Bowl  this year  for Serious XM  Satellite Radio.  We'll have that list  in a minute.  That's a lot of fucking  people on that list.  We do like a good list.  Man, one tweet yesterday  from me  just made me so aware  how ridiculous  Twitter has become.  Oh, yeah.  Becoming less and less  a fan of Twitter.  Yeah?  Yeah.  Just too many idiots  that just don't get it. 
[01:08:00]  It is a very  annoying medium.  I became aware  that Phil Mickelson  was having a  round of his life.  The golfer  Phil Mickelson.  So I write  something like  holy shit  Phil Mickelson  is 11 under  with a few holes  to play.  And I wouldn't  just tweet that.  I'm a golf fan  but I understand  how this shit works  and that  most people  that follow me  wouldn't give a fuck  about a golf tweet. 
[01:08:30]  But like I was telling you  before the show  sometimes things happen  if you're not into  the sport  or the subject  at hand  it's so much  bigger than  the actual  sport  that it makes you  interested in it  for a minute.  For a minute!  So people thought  I was just doing  a golf tweet.  I'm like  no you idiots.  Phil Mickelson  is going for  something that  has rarely happened  in the PGA  and that is  to shoot  a 59.  I think five  or six golfers  in the history  of the sport 
[01:09:00]  have shot  a 59.  That's cray.  And he was  pretty much  one or two  birdies away  from that  when I tweeted  and everyone  was talking  about it  on  birdies  everyone on  Twitter was  talking about it  it made me  go watch  yeah  you're watching  something that  rarely happens  so it's not  no I'm not  just tweeting  about golf  I'm tweeting  about something  that is a  rare occurrence  and these idiots  just come out  of the woodwork  I'm like  you know what  why bother  and it wasn't 
[01:09:30]  like they were  trying to have  a little fun  with it  they were just  being idiots  right  I have a question  long story short  he choked right  yeah long story short  Phil Mickelson  choked  and if you know  now this is  now it's the  discussion about  Phil Mickelson  and his career  it describes  his career  perfectly  he's won a lot  of tournaments  don't get me wrong  but he's also  lost a shit load  because he chokes  and misses easy  putts and stuff  so yesterday  he needed  he needed  just one birdie 
[01:10:00]  with two holes  to go  on his 17th hole  because he was  playing the front  nine if it matters  but on his 17th hole  he actually leaves  a putt like  I don't know  two inches short  that would have  went in if he just  hit the fucking ball  take your skirt off  but I mean  if you're in that  position you shouldn't  leave the putt short  but he did  so then he goes  to 18  his 18th  and he needs  a birdie  to shoot  the 59  that screen  went off  by the way  Jimmy's gonna  want to see this  we lost our minds 
[01:10:30]  when I showed it  to Anthony  who's not really  and you proved  my point  because you're not  really  you don't give  a fuck about  golf  but you gave  a fuck  about what  this was all  about in the end  right  I hate  Phil Mickelson  really  so  he comes to 18  his approach  shot  leaves him  I'm not really  sure  probably  I would say  between 20  and 25 feet  so the odds  of him doing  it now  are slim  yeah  okay  but it is  possible  he hits  this fucking  putt  all it has  to do  is go in 
[01:11:00]  and gets  the 59  he thinks  it's in  he's starting  to do  his celebration  fucking  what do you  call it  before the show  he was going  for the  for the  shoot him  a Gavin  yeah  he's gonna  pew pew  or something  he's walking  as the putt's  going toward  the cup  he's walking  and now  he's got his  fists like  holy fuck  I just did it  yeah  now you gotta  show Jimmy  what happened  because he  doesn't know  no  I know he  didn't get  it  but did  you see  it  no  it fucking 
[01:11:30]  it went  completely  around the  cup  and didn't  go in  yeah  he fucking  that wasn't  even choking  it was just  bad luck  horrendous  horrendous  luck  but if you  know anything  about Phil  Mickelson  you're like  of course  this happened  to him  of course  it did  what happened  to our  computer  oh man  I had to do  a hard reboot  because the mouse  just stopped  working in the  middle of your  talk  so that's sexy  does the radio  wizard have any  intention of making  our computers better 
[01:12:00]  in studio  or is he going to  just listen to us  talk about it  over and over  again for the  next fucking  two years  well the flap  is up on the  wall  that's good  we got that  fixed  but does he  hear us talk  about how horrendous  our computers  are in studio  are in studio  I don't have to  reboot any of my  horrible computers  at home  because the mouse  doesn't work  they're going to  end up replacing  it with something  else from around  here and that's  I mean all the  computers  they do  they just take  another broken  thing from  someone else  and put it  here  they take  from Frick  they get  the frack  but what 
[01:12:30]  do I know  why is he  associated with  our show  if he can't  just fix  a lousy  easy problem  like our  computer  after what he  talked  oh I think  about Marsha  he does  what he can  alright  cause this  you know  I wanted  to mention  the Phil  Mickelson  thing  it should  have been  two minutes  now we're  up to about  five minutes  talking about  this  cause we had  to wait  for the  fucking  reboot  and then of  course it  fucks up the  whole timing  of what you're  talking about  but that's  okay right  radio wizard  you do what  you're doing  here it is  for Jim  Norton  so this is 
[01:13:00]  the putt  lines it up  oh that's  good  oh it  totally  toilet  bold  right around  the top  for a 59  for a 59  that has only 
[01:13:30]  been five or  six other  times  and they  called it  a cooler  lip out  than that  look at that  it just  it's going  so slow  the ball  too  it didn't  whip around  the top  of the cup  it just  slowly  went around  the outside  yeah he's  pointing his  putter at the  hole like  here it  goes  I got  this  59  bitches  you see  his caddy  yes caddy 
[01:14:00]  just falls  down  drops to the  ground  he's crawling  on the green  but if caddy  falls if you get  close you can  hear him just  go oh you  cunt  you cunt  yeah  so you know  my point being  I wouldn't  just you know  have just a  basic tweet  about golf  this was a  special thing  that was going  down yesterday  afternoon  he's a douche  Phil Nicholson  he always does  this  that's his  career right  there  whoops 
[01:14:30]  he would have  won a bunch  of other  tournaments  if he didn't  choke  great putt  I don't know  how it stayed  out right  play the rest  of it  is there  anything else  in this  it's on  deadspin  they show  a better  view of  him  yeah  like he's  like  yeah  look at  this  oh  that is  amazing  holy fuck 
[01:15:00]  how did  that not  fall  that should  have like  hit the rim  gone around  a little  lost enough  speed  and then  dropped in  the cup  it pretty  much  went  almost  completely  around  just a little  bit was  left  popped  right out  of the  cup  so that was  a big deal  yesterday  in sports  in general  he ended up  shooting a 60  that no one's  going to remember  I think  1800 guys  have done  60  and only  5 or 6  have done 
[01:15:30]  59  that big a  difference  between 59  and 60  I don't know  I don't know  the exact  number  I shot a 60  once  you did  yeah  on the 17th  hole  what  Sam  so who's  going to  the Super  Bowl  or who  is down  at the  Super  Bowl  by the way  can I  ask the  guy  59  is like  a 300  in bowling  who the  fuck  wouldn't  watch  that  well  that's  the point  I was  trying to  make  there  thanks  for  backing  me up  thank you  for the  blueberries  but could  you not  put them  all on  my  I like 
[01:16:00]  that you  wash  my  blueberries  but they  put them  all on  the fucking  paper plate  so now  I have  to eat  all of  them  in one  sitting  a dish  of  blueberries  that was  a giant  dish  of  blueberries  I appreciate  them  watching  I just  want them  kept in  the thing  so I  can put  them  aside  and close  them  but now  I gotta be  blueberry  eating  motherfucker  so here's  the list  of shows  that are  down there  at the  Super  Bowl  for  Sirius XM  why wouldn't  they send  us  do they  say we  can go  to the  Super  Bowl  or we  can  do a  bus  thing  no  they 
[01:16:30]  didn't  ever  they  never  gave us  the  choice  one  or  the  other  there  you  go  they  said  well  we're  doing  this  bus  thing  alright  so  this  is  my  list  as it  stands  it  could  be  added  to  as  new  information  comes  in  we've  been  on  satellite  for  eight  years  now  so  that  might  be  nine  Super  Bowls  some  could  do  the  actual  math  but  this  might  be  the  ninth  Super  Bowl  since  being  on  satellite  and  the  19th  Super 
[01:17:00]  Bowl  since  we've  been  working  together  that  we're  not  at  19  straight  Super  Bowls  amazing  stupid  radio  shows  from  dumb  little  tiny  little  markets  go  oh  they  get  to  go  it's  just  amazing  so  this  year  here's  the  list  of  shows  going  and  I  just  assumed  that  the  company  might  have  decided  to  cut  back  and  not  send  anybody  but  it's  pretty  obvious  that  nope  yeah  that's  incorrect  mad  dog  obviously  okay  all right  evan  phillips  it's  obvious  it's 
[01:17:30]  you know  steve  phillips  sports  show  who's  evan  of the  evan  phillips  show  i think  he used  to be  a general  manager  for the  mets  or  something  oh  god  yeah  i don't  know  adam shine  another  sports  guy  also  works  for the  yes  network  i don't  know  adam  shine  okay  he's  a  personality  maurice  jones  drew  is  hosting  a  fantasy  all  three  show  fantasy  football  the fantasy  football  guys  got to  go  it's  being  covered  don't  tell  florentine  all of  nfl radio  is there  the entire

[01:18:30]  radio  yeah  blue collar  that's still  on  does anyone  listen to that  i wouldn't  think so  i'm being honest  yeah there's probably  a couple truck  drivers who enjoy  it but it's not  a heavily  listened to  channel  all right  the morning mash  up is there  mashing it up  morning mash  yeah  cavino and rich  are there  i just call  them morning mash  you do  yeah  yeah  just a little  mash  now morning mash  up is what  like six people  there's four of  them  four of them  yeah  why didn't we

[01:20:00]  to find out  what they thought  of tna last  night live  from radio  row at the  super bowl  oh christ  and finally  mr jay thomas  live from  radio row  but he's a  part-timer  does ira get  to go  oh he's on  every day  he does  afternoons  is ira gonna  be with him  in new  war  i would assume  so i know  stinky did  not get to  go  oh  he thought  he was gonna  get to go  yeah  and it didn't  come through  for him  why  he's good  well they  figured jay's  always on  isdn  anyways  watching the 
[01:20:30]  super bowl  yeah but why  don't you just  throw the kid  a bone  being a loyal  employee  football  and a super  dog  i love  fucking  god  he's the  best  ira  you are  right though  some of  those sports  shows probably  could have been  cut back  some kind of  reporting from  back in new  york could  have  you forgot  somebody  who's that  well this  guy will  tell us  okay  john in  mobile 
[01:21:00]  alabama  john  bob edwards  to new  orleans  motherfucker  bob edwards  has been  a thorn in  our fucking  side forever  i couldn't  confirm that  he was at  radio row  or if he was  just doing  super bowl  themed shows  but if this  caller says it  i'm putting  him on the  list bob  edwards  bob edwards  live from  the coffin  bob edwards  and who  did he  interview  he interviewed 
[01:21:30]  the mayor  of new  orleans  oh  there you  go  that would  be a  wonderful  interview  not ray  nagin  oh boy  is he in  dutch  is he  really  oh yeah  what happened  to ray  nagin  well apparently  some misappropriation  of funds  and contracts  after katrina  uh you  know he  just couldn't  keep his  hands off  of that  till  no  another name  added to  the list  what  mark says  hi  is at 
[01:22:00]  the super  what is  that  that's not  a name  confirm  mark says  hi  mark says  hi  that's  confirmed  via his  twitter  21 hours  ago  touchdown  in new  orleans  his last  name is  seaman  mark seaman  is his  name  i would  change it  to says  hi  too  so mark  says hi  is indeed  at the  super  bowl  mark seaman  is went  you know  like we  like to  make those  lists  i really  want this 
[01:22:30]  and it  might bore  the listeners  so maybe  we could  do it  another  day  i want  a list  of things  the radio  wizard actually  does for  this channel  oh wow  is he here  today  i really  need to  know  can he  come on  can we  get him  on  i'm not  gonna yell  much  i don't  know if  he's here  yet  he should  he's usually  here around  now  can someone  check  can we  send an  intern down  to check  to request  his presence  from him  but what  does he  actually do  for the  channel  he's a  liaison  for what  legalese  is that  french for  lazy  what is 
[01:23:00]  liaison  he was a  big help  in putting  together  the  gay off  you know  the rules  and everything  and all  that  by the way  get your  gay off  you know  entries in  by noon  today  today  yeah  wow  how many  do we  have  a bunch  oh good  good for  you  there's a lot  of shows  i feel a sick  day coming on  oh fuck  for the gay off  yeah  all right  you don't have  fun the rest  of us will  the rest of us  will  oh boy 
[01:23:30]  there's so many  shows  well that's a  long list of  shows  i had to  maximize the  window  you did  i had to  blow it  up full  screen  just so  we could  see every  show  so you  could fit  in  mark  says  hi  what does  he do  though  he just  interviews  like comedians  all right  so there  are gonna be  comics down  there  no he'll  interview  football  players  but he'll  do it  in like a  funny way  for the  comedy  channel  can we  actually  get some  of some  audio from  what these  guys are  doing  any one of 
[01:24:00]  those shows  could have  been scrapped  and our  name could  have been  there and  it would  have been  we got  special needs  on this  show so  they would  have had a  scratch two  or three  i would  easily said  goodbye to  marxist high  bob edwards  and busted  open that's  three shows  and then we  could have  fit in there  nice  you wouldn't  put the  wrestling show  on radio  row  no  and i  you know  then we  could have  like had  a little  fun back  and forth  banter with  the morning  mashup  i would have  told that  rich guy  choose a  fucking show  you can't  go down  there for  two shows  he's down 
[01:24:30]  there for  two shows  so you  decide which  show you're  going to go  down for  and then  we're going  to get rid  of the  other show  so covino  you could  stay home  right  we'll use  that money  for the  on a show  right  so we  take covino's  money  the busted  open guys  money  bob edwards  mark says  hi we take  all their  money  exactly  so we go  down there  jeff foxworthy  what no  sorry  you get rid  of him too  there's no  reason for him  to be down  there  that means  we can  upgrade to  a fucking  you know  first class  flight  well they were  probably wanting  to  we take  jeff foxworthy's  money so we 
[01:25:00]  could fly  accommodations  once we're  down there  we don't  stay in  some shitholes  right so  at that point  we gotta say  goodbye to  evan and phillips  oh evan and phillips  has to go  look we need  fucking you know  those are our  rooms  that's right  our suites  yeah  exactly  we're gonna  write off our  dinners and we  don't eat  fucking shit  so mark says  hi  sorry we're  having steak  your dinner  night one  right  and how do  we pay for  anthony's alcohol  oh my god  mad dog might  have to

[01:28:30]  it's mud  it's just  literally  we're fucking  stepping in  mud and  getting nowhere  we got more  done when it  was just us  as soon as  they started  throwing middle  management around  us it it just  yeah just  slowed down  everything  i i asked  so long ago  i don't even  know and i  gave up on  this one  i got a  massive  fucking board  in front of  me like  metallica is  mixing uh  the black  album and  and i don't 
[01:29:00]  want it  anymore  yeah  and they  can't i  want  counter space  wouldn't that  be nice  but i said  this so long  ago i  couldn't even  tell you  you gotta say  things 80  times i think  that's the  number  give me times  i've had  that there's  something to do  with netflix  i had a  financial  question  right  that i've  been trying  to get an  answer out of  my manager  from since  december  yeah  and it's  like i'm  talking to him  yesterday i'm  like i asked  for this  information two  months ago  oh boy  there's certain  things in my  life i can 
[01:29:30]  control and  there's certain  things i can't  i cannot control  what people  outside of me  do like there's  certain information  we can't control  so i have to  accept that that's  going to be  fucked up half the  time right  but the shit  that i can  control or  that's in my  ability to  control them or  the people that  work with me  right well that's  what i want done  it's like i see  i'm like you're my  fucking manager this  is what we got to  do yeah i want  this information you  can get it from  someone in two  months or whatever  it is yeah we got  you know this middle 
[01:30:00]  management they can't  push the the show  forward i i was  fortunate enough to  do uh joe rogan's  podcast uh a couple  weeks ago when i was  in la his podcast is  passing us by  just because of  the technology  it's embarrassing  every this point  every week whoever's  on his show they  make sure they do  some kind of video  and they put it up  on youtube and it  does extremely well  yeah we have to you  know beg for them to  just update our  section on the  siriusxm website  how does that look  by the way and 
[01:30:30]  it's always and they  can't even think out  of the box they just  think well if it's an  a-lister we'll make  sure we get a video  up there it's like no  there's stuff happening  all the time and a  video should go up  exactly there should be  a podcast what yeah  there should be a  podcast an opian  anthony podcast because  that world is huge  right now it's hot so  just get us in there  and and and and this  is how you do it it's  really simple because  they'll go well we  don't want to give  away the fucking  material so how about  how about the eight

[01:37:30]  a camera so you could be that  guy that's holding up the ipad  idiot the mini's are pretty  good though i mean uh well  the new one is the same as  the old one really why  wouldn't i get the ipad  better screen people love  the mini yeah people i know  there's a new ipad coming  out that just has more  storage but i don't need  all that people do love the  mini but i personally really  like the size of the regular  ipad for like yeah for like  watching movies and tv and  stuff and so the ipad mini  could do that stuff iraq's  got an update yes yes buddy uh  he's done with his meeting but  he doesn't want to discuss this  on the air he said if you 
[01:38:00]  want to come down to his  office i'll talk you should  have said that to jimmy but  i don't understand why that's  only the information jesus you  really don't talk to me like  i i understand that i'll talk  i just want to do it off the  air yeah he's got a high  voice well i just found i got  the phone number sort of of  the uh atlanta security guard  okay great reliable source but  for some reason if you uh just  after uh maybe for tomorrow's 
[01:38:30]  show maybe this guy's fucking  with me  tomorrow's saturday right yep  all right this guy's usually  reliable why is he fucking with  me  whatever i'll figure out  i'm not i'm not doing it i'm  gonna need you guys to go ahead  and come on in on saturday  saturday yeah so you going down  jim  no i mean i'm this is what we do  what do we do i do a radio show  for a living  you do  yes when are you gonna start  it's after i leave here it's a 
[01:39:00]  little it's the jim norton show  i work an hour a week on  yes  but when you say like i guess if  we were discussing something like  you know that but there's not  personal stuff like if like if and  we wouldn't go there because  they're it's a weird thing maybe  it's too inside but if someone has  determined that someone is a  private citizen we don't fuck with  them that's our line and it always  has been so if something came up  about his family or this or that  then i would totally understand  but this is yeah this is about the 
[01:39:30]  show so you should go on the air  every single fucking time oh boy  and this that that this culture of i  don't want to talk about it on the  air  it it's ridiculous  bless you my love  thank you it's ridiculous i hope i'm  giving you your cold back because  you know this is i i i take some  day quill but wore off yeah i'm  just itchy like inside my nose and  my eyes are itchy that deep bitch  yeah yeah i'm like i want to  scratch it but i can't i'd love to  scratch it with the fucking heel of  my shoe  i'd like edward norton to scratch it 
[01:40:00]  on a curb  all right well who so can we uh send a  representative down there because  jimmy's not a representative yeah i'm  not gonna go down i want to discuss  today computer software that we've  been bitching about for how many  years i know it's more than a year  been a while well i mean technically  they've replaced the computer in here  they have replaced it i think it  works fine  no cute i had to restart it because  the mouse stopped working but i mean  you know restarts oh this is fucking 
[01:40:30]  awesome  what happened especially when i'll send  let me i'm going to tweet this to you  op  oh there's a just a picture  busted open  tweeted a picture of them at the rate at  radio row  all right  that's our supposed fans are rubbing  it in they keep sending pictures of  all these other shows having fun  down there  it out just stuck in the fucking  mud mud and i i tell you man it 
[01:41:00]  drives me but it's not just with the  radio show it's like stuff in my my  stand-up stuff too then but it's  beyond my control like if you ask for  something  like not again i can't make a network  give me an answer i can't yell at my  manager and go why aren't they  answer i understand that's beyond his  control  uh-huh when i say how much does  netflix pay for a stand-up special  i realize it varies  louis is gonna make a lot more than  fucking myself aziz is gonna make a  lot more than my  i understand all that shit 
[01:41:30]  uh-huh  so we can't uh you know i just want to  know a range  right and i'm getting  that but i hate asking for the same  fucking thing  oh boy it drives me crazy yeah you  don't have to say to me every night  hey could you go up and work on  material  why because it's my fucking job oh  shit  i know what my job is it's a weird  world we live in it's it's middle  management  because they can't really sign off on  anything without talking to the  people that are above them 
[01:42:00]  it's a wild world but it's not even  that  it's not even that it's like i i that i  get that i get  that's part of it though  the reason  and then there's incompetence of course  but when they won't come on the air  and discuss something that they can  control  yeah  you know what i'm saying like we  can't make netflix give me a figure  i like  but you can get me the range  give me the figure though  that's in our control  right  you know enough people in this  business  who have fun  and i don't want to call comedians  and say  what did you get to go  because that's kind of tacky  uh-huh  uh so but a manager could call agents 
[01:42:30]  or other managers and that could be  done  sure  i hate non-movement that drives me  fucking crazy  but we're in the mud  it's what it's exactly what it is  it's stuck in the mud  it's slug  that's the shoes  stuck in the mud  in the morning  you think your shoes come off  in the mud  yeah  you ever do that as a kid  you're like  oh fuck yeah  running and then your shoe  just fucking comes off  then your sock is all muddy  i want to shoot a special  and just put it on my website 
[01:43:00]  i really do  like i know i'm gonna lose money  like i will not be able to do it  like gaffigan or lure  as easy  but i just want to do it  i don't want to fucking deal with any networks anymore  i just want to do that  and over time  the money will come back  right  it's scary to see podcasts doing uh  way more than we are here  when we were way ahead of all those guys  way ahead of them  it's fucking embarrassing  and they're passing us by  one by one  i did bob kelly's podcast  i think it's gonna be available monday  and he's doing some really cool shit  with his podcast  and making sure there's like 
[01:43:30]  you know pictures every day  of that show  and uh  not every day  because he does it weekly  but then they make sure  they do a little video  and all sorts of like  just cool technical shit  he had way better advertisers  than us  his advertising  i was like  really  why are they advertising  on our show  that's amazing  it's really weird man  the podcast  when you look at joe's  or uh  joe's doing really well  bobby's getting there  you got mark maron  doing really well  well yeah  maron has a show  that's based on his podcast 
[01:44:00]  adam carolla's kicking ass  with his podcast  he might be the biggest  right now i think  bill burr is moving up  there quickly  jay moore's moving up  there quickly  yeah  and yeah  one by one  i see him  i see him  they're all right there  in our rear view mirror  how is kevin smith  kevin smith is  destroying  so  motivated everywhere  like kevin smith  is not a talker  kevin smith  is a doer  he fucking  always  does something  here on the ifc 
[01:44:30]  oh  another fucking channel  you're on  thank god i like kevin smith  or i would  i would want to vomit  every time i turn my tv on  because he's on it  what's he doing now  a movie  what's he doing  he's writing  oh it's a comic book thing  oh he's sold out of that  kevin smith is a fucking doer  he's an animal  he's not stuck in the mud  he's motivated  he's  you know what he did  he had his fucking podcast  place out there  and then what did he do  he moved to a better place  because it got bigger  he went to  to john uh  lovett's club  he's a fucking guy  who moves  it's a great point 
[01:45:00]  there's doers  and there's talkers  he's a doer  we're uh  surrounded by a lot of talkers  i don't know if it's the corporate structure of sirius xm  or it's the individual  but we certainly have talkers  me and i just had a meeting last week  talking about this wall  and they're like  well let's uh  give it a couple weeks  and we'll talk about it again  why give it a couple weeks  perfect example  let's move on it  what could be the problem  mud  fucking  mud  mud  mud  it drives me nuts  asking the same thing  over and over again 
[01:45:30]  because again  and i tell him  and this is my manager i'll tell  who i love  but i'll tell him like  dude there's certain things  we can't control  i get that  like i'm not a crazy person  i believe me know  that there's fucking  twenty percent of it  we control  eighty percent of it  the rest of the business  does what the fuck they want  and we are  you know  it's contingent upon them  telling us  but when the twenty percent  it gets fucked up  oh boy  yeah  yeah the twenty percent  shouldn't be in the mud  it shouldn't be in the mud  and again maybe i'm partially  responsible because this  like bob kelly and i were 
[01:46:00]  talking and he was  talking about how he wants  to talk about  i've been talking about  shooting something  um  bob  yes bob and myself  threw my head  into his melon head  uh  but but he's like  dude let's just do it  and he's actually pushing me  i'm like yeah you're right  because it ain't gonna happen  with my fucking  and i'm not saying i have a  bad manager i don't  he's very loyal  he loves me  he works very hard  right  but he's one of those guys  who is comfortable  uh  just talking about things  and it's really weird 
[01:46:30]  because he's  i'll never find another  a guy as fiercely loyal  as john  right  who believes in me like john  so i'm not ready to walk  away from john  no one ever finds the  perfect uh  anything  so obviously you got  a guy that's very loyal  very good  he believes very strongly  in me  and he's fiercely loyal  but then there's that  you know  other part  that's like  ah i wish that part  could be  as uh  i need an agent  that's the problem  i have a personal  appearance agent  but i need an agent  and i don't have an agent  uh i haven't had one  because i haven't  really needed one  secret one 
[01:47:00]  yes  that'd be good  this is how frustrating  i just called gary  and he answers the phone  but he didn't say anything  what did he do  that's weird  he picked it up  and just  yeah  what's  did he pick it up  and hang up again  listen  do it again  maybe he's not used  to that number calling him  you didn't recognize it  thought i was a telemarketer  one ringy thingy  look at what i'm doing  poland  two ringy dingies 
[01:47:30]  that's uh  a lilly tom one  lilly tom one  your call has been forwarded  to an automatic  oh  oh  of course  your call has been forwarded  of course  to a moron  call has been forwarded  to the pay no mind list  oh shit  we could be on fire  in here  you gotta answer your phone  this is an example  of what i'm talking about  i want to shoot  an hour special  in boston  i wanted to do something  with other comedians  i have zero desire  to do that anymore  zero desire 
[01:48:00]  so i'm making the decision  to scrap it  okay sir  um  i could have done it  and i'm scrapping it  so i want to shoot my own hour  and fuck other comics  i don't want to deal with them  i want to do my own thing  so i'm ready to shoot  been ready to shoot  so i said let me  to convince them to let me shoot  because it's less than a year  we happen to have a very busy year  in the news  thank god  so it worked out  so i'm thanking god  it's all misery  um  like that's why god  he's good at that  yeah shootings  so jim has another 20 minutes  but i said let's  we videotaped  some shows 
[01:48:30]  hour sets  to show these different people  at a couple of different places  this is what i'm doing  just so you know  it's not  bullshit  i'm not saying  i can do an hour  and i can't  so two of the top executives  that i needed to see this  got the dvds  the both of them  because my camera  splits things in half  it's mts files  both of them said  oh we thought  that it was only a half hour  when are you gonna be ready  to shoot an hour  i just i'm like  i'm like i've been ready  it's coming out  like an hour and 15  what do you mean  he goes oh we got the thing  but there's only  a half hour on it 
[01:49:00]  oh my god  and i called the other person  the other executive  and i said how long was that  she goes well i'm looking  at my thing  a file 27 minutes  both of these discs  did have two files on them  but it should have  just put together as one  or it should have  been explained better  uh  because of course  there was reasons  well no no no  we told we had them both  i'm like if both executives  who are not retarded  looked at this thing  and saw 30 minute  fucking sets  it wasn't explained right  yeah yeah yeah  and the one guy  came back and said 
[01:49:30]  i'm sorry it was actually  on the disc  but it obviously  was not presented to him  yes  right  it should have been  an hour long  hour and 10 minutes  it was  instead of uh  yeah  but i'm like that's  the type of lethargy  when you're not doing  what you're supposed to do  i never would have known  that if i hadn't talked  to this guy  and then followed up  and called her  right  because he just  they just told my manager  hey it looks good  what are they gonna say  yeah  where's the other half hour  this concert  it's not comedy central  in 1990  where's this hour  it's a half hour 
[01:50:00]  was he doing crowd work  for 30 minutes  so my manager  was like oh yeah  they watched it  they liked it  good follow up  oh my god  but he probably just asked  did you watch it  they were like yeah  they were probably  embarrassed for me  oh  like yeah it just ended  at least your guy  has some kind of awareness  he does  i mean but  that's the type of shit  that is fucking  like that we can control  getting them the fucking tape  and making sure  that they understand  there's two on here  yeah yeah  or whatever  how did  how did what they saw 
[01:50:30]  end it like  abruptly  in mid talk  so uh  you know  or who knows  what half they got  it could have started  yeah  so i told her  oh right  it might have been like  the second half  that they got  which would have  just started  in nowhere  they thought you were  doing like a sopranos  ending thing  oh yeah  just cutting it off  yes  my camera tapes  don't stop believing  playing  it's an mts file  like i said  i'm being redundant here  but i mean they could  that could easily be made  into one through  i don't know how to do it  but i talked to the guy  my manager 
[01:51:00]  obviously says it's a slow  process because it has  to integrate or whatever  oh you must render it  after um you put them  together in a final cut pro  it's really really really easy  so the next day  that could have been done  it didn't have to be sloppy  and fucking lazy  yeah  yeah  you just literally dump them  into final cut  and then put the two clips  together and then just  share burn dvd  that sounds hard  that's uh  it takes hours right  to integrate  it might take an hour  i heard he said it would  take 10 hours to integrate  10 hours  for an hour and 10 
[01:51:30]  a video  of mts  nah it won't take 10  unless the computers  they're using are  five years old  then yeah  but there's no fucking way  it would take 10 hours  are they working on  computers here  that's fine  yeah  then it doesn't get done  and i don't mean to  bore people with this  inside nonsense  but it's just like  it's like  it's just the frustration  of  i think that  i think  there's a relatability  to this  i think people deal  with middle management  in their freaking  or people feel like  they're just not  moving forward  yeah never  it's just  you wait forever  um 
[01:52:00]  i want to know  if my old  college radio pal  jim chandler  is at the super bowl  he is  for real  chandler  oh my god  he's in nashville  where he will always be  oh man  what the fuck sam  i'm trying to fucking  build this bridge  i'm saying  why would you leave  what about bfg tv  what about bfg tv  now i don't know  if he's fucking with me  because now people  told him yesterday  that i'm trying to get  a hold of him  through direct messages  on um twitter  and now he's telling  all these people 
[01:52:30]  that he doesn't see  any dms from me  oh boy  oh boy  that's impossible  because then i checked  my dms and i absolutely  gave him a dm  it's impossible  maybe he's not  as twitter savage  he might not know  about the dms  a lot of people  he might use a weird  fucking or just do it  on his computer  my dm  he might think dms  are at mentions  or something  yeah why am i explaining  for like a  i'm his codependent wife  i don't know  what the deal is  why don't i shut  the fuck up  oh damn it  oh you got the  clean version  hear it again  fuck you tom  get the bricks  nigga 
[01:53:00]  we want that  why do we have  this first thing  because it's eric  what's the first part  play it again  fuck you tom  hit the bricks  nigga  why don't we just  have hit the bricks  nigga  that's all we want  a clean version  of that  i thought it was  all the same dude  sorry  i'll try  oh my god  even if it was  that's still  not hit the bricks  nigga  i don't care  i don't care  what guy it is  we just want  are you saying  he rocks in the mug  even though  he's fog  well that's where  he lives  he rocks his fog  yeah he's in the fog  he means well  once in a while 
[01:53:30]  he'll poke his head up  and just see like  uh  like the lochness monster  eric that fucking  that booth right there  is like the fucking van  in the first  cheech and chong  boy  he almost gets it  yeah once in a while  he'll poke his head out  he almost gets it  hey man  go back in  the wrong clip  we just wanted it  nice and clean  so we could play that  right eric  i want to play tetris man  here's my uh  dm to jim  jim chandler  1075  all one word  it says 
[01:54:00]  all kidding aside  oh  i'd love to catch up  and then i wrote  had kevin o'neill  on the show  today  haven't talked to him  in 20 years  did he respond  no because he doesn't  think he got that  but he had to  why did you text him  i don't know  his phone number  oh  that's what i'm trying  to  i'm trying to work  toward maybe a phone  number then we'll do  a little texting  and then we'll uh  we'll talk for the  first time in 20  some odd years  wow  maybe that's karma  for not responding  to gary when he calls  gary who  our esteemed boss 
[01:54:30]  here  i give everyone  a chance  and then it gets  to a point where  i know it's a  complete waste of  time and that's  when i do shut  out people and  never fucking  respond to their  phone calls or  text messages  oh i know  what you're talking  about  it's the truth  so do you want  to go to the  super bowl next  year  no  oh  that's the one  that's here  is a shit  all expense paid  trip to fucking  across the bridge  because you know  that they're gonna

[02:00:30]  the ice cream scoop  another african-american  contribution to enrich  our lives for black  history month this is  the opian anthony show  this is the opian anthony  channel on sirius xm  i was driving home and i  was behind a bus you  know like the bus has an  automatic sign 9-1-1 call  police i call 9-1-1  9-1-1 what is the  emergency i'm on uh 10th  avenue northbound and i'm  behind the bus and the 
[02:01:00]  sign says call 9-1-1 i  thought it was a stolen  bus i didn't know it was  happening there could have  been hostages i mean we  all saw that keanu reeder's  movie i'm on the phone with  the 911 and this fucking  dummy is where are you now  i said i'm northbound on  47th street on 10th avenue  okay you're on now where  are you now i said 48th  street where are you now  49th street that she was  and you said it's heading  which way sir northbound the  only way you can go on  10th avenue we're so  irritated with these  dummies so we make the  left on 57th street we go  down to 11th avenue i go  look he's making the left  on 11th avenue it's a  yellow light so the bus 
[02:01:30]  slows down and then shoots  through the light and  leaves me at the red light  i knew that the bus did  that on purpose i'm like  this guy knows i'm behind  him now we're going  southbound again so i  called back no one way  it's emergency so i just  called and no one is  doing anything i'm  following a stolen bus i  think no one is doing  it how long does it take  to get a squad car in  11th avenue so i pull up  next to it and it's  really dark on the bus  and i just see some  there's a black dude i'm  on the phone i'm like i'm  looking at the guy and  he's just a black dude  but he's not dressing a  bus driver and i know  that he's stealing this  bus i'm northbound now  and he's behind me like  what street i'm like 
[02:02:00]  now we're passing 40th  street the woman was  like where was he  before uh 10th and  11th but then he came  down 11th and now we  went up 10th he's  probably going to turn it  off because you're  going to lose him  so you keep saying  10th and 11th but  10th and 11th are in  parallel what street and  11th i know he was on  10th and then he went  down 11th so then i was  just like fuck this  shit and i drive away  and he pulls away slowly  and starts to drive and  i'm like you know what  forget it you know  what thank you just  turned it off he just  turned it off okay we  lost him and he probably  turned into the bus depot  serious xm the opian

[02:10:30]  half the time  and this was supposed to be  maybe a tenth of the time  philly mick  that's i just want to  state that today  thank you  so uh  while we were on break  and we were all in the  uh bathroom together  yeah  this played on our channel  yo yo  it's super bowl time again  i said get up  and sway in the morning  we'll broadcast live  from the big easy  well join me  sway calloway  for exclusive interviews  with artists and sports figures  live from the new orleans  convention center  with heatherby tracy g 
[02:11:00]  and dj wonder  the stars are up early  for sway in the morning  you gotta love it baby  today exclusively  on sirius xm  j45  so  can i  can i  oh my god  can i start  we love sway  and we would promote  anything he's doing  absolutely  i really like the guy  he's been very cool  since he's been here  and he's good at what he does  and he's an mtv guy  and i was a little starstruck  when i saw him  and it turns out  he's just a cool 
[02:11:30]  fucking dude  um  but we're really mad  we're not at the super bowl  and they think  that we're important enough  to promote other shows  at the super bowl  but we're not important enough  to actually be at the super bowl  to be there  well we have our duty  and that's here  and wouldn't that add  insult to injury  by doing that  you'd think  and if someone is kind of  in charge of our channel  they would probably  would understand that  hey turn this off  and turn on the guys  who were at the super bowl  yeah  but after our long discussion 
[02:12:00]  about the super bowl  and i will acknowledge that too  it went a little long  and then gary came in here  and once again  reiterated  he will not go on the air  with any of this shit  and then what he said  totally could have been on the air  of course  then he heard the sway thing  back in his uh cubicle  because i don't think  he's good enough  to have an actual office  does he have an office  he has a split office  he has a split office  yes it's an office  i don't want a guy  that's overseeing our channel  in a split office  i i feel like 
[02:12:30]  our guy should have  his own office  i'm starting to feel like  he should have a corner office  matter of fact  not a split office  there's a half wall  between him and his office  oh that's so cute  who's his office mate  it's a young lady  who runs a couple music channels  i believe  nice  uh i heard from stinky  on the way to the bathroom  also  stinky  he's right in there  that's iraq  i heard from stinky  um  because i asked him  why aren't you at the superbowl  he goes oh yeah yeah  he goes i thought i was going  but uh  no it turns out 
[02:13:00]  i you know  i couldn't go  he goes  any of your guys going  i'm like yeah sure  we're all pieces of shit  and uh  and then he told me  that jay thomas is going  to do one hour  of radio  he's not going to the super  he doesn't have tickets  or anything  he's not going  to do  because he's literally  doing an hour of radio  no that's impossible  down in  no i can't believe that  that's it  who is he paying for it  or is sirius  sirius  he's not going to pay  for himself  for an hour of radio  uh and then he said  uh and boy are we missing 
[02:13:30]  the fucking parties  sirius xm is throwing  down there  apparently scott  is throwing like  these huge parties  that go into like  the wee hours of the morning  these nice star studded  fucking  bashes  superbowl bashes  we can ask mark zito  and liam about them  when they get back  who's mark zito  is there  oh yeah  and liam too  and liam  sure the talent book  would arrive  for the shows  so um  but all the stuff  that's expensive  to send this show down  oh god 
[02:14:00]  yeah the amount of money  they spend every year  at the superbowl  is pretty crazy  huge parties  i'm hearing  into the wee hours  of the morning  into the wee  hours of the morning  we could have been  a part of that  and talked about that  oh i know  you know they're doing  everything they can  to make sure  they're celebrities  at those parties  oh please  we all know  that scott's  a big celebrity  a hound  i didn't say that  so the radio wizard  he pulled the sway promo  but it was a little  too late now  wasn't it  it's too late  you're a little too late  it is pulled now  it's not gonna air anymore 
[02:14:30]  i saw it on twitter  how did it get through  to begin with  who makes the decision  to allow that through  and this is not  a radio wizard  in the end  we really like sway  this is simply about  it's just  of course i said all that  it's insult to injury  it really is  yeah it's up to him  i think  he needs to have  an awareness  about that stuff  i could be wrong  but i think that  the promos  are more of  the commercials  are more of a  rob cross thing  i think  whoa rob  more of a rob cross deal  jesus  well how did 
[02:15:00]  chuck roast  not catch this  chuck roast  who does what  around here  uh i don't  uh rightly know  confused now  i don't rightly know  there's another  super bowl ad  that's coming up  a little later  in the log  oh yeah  can we hear that one  let's hear it  let's hear the log  my goal is to get  jim norton to throw  something  it won't happen  though  i know  i'm  today  do you realize  i'm in such a  i'm in a weird  today's 26 years  sober for me  february 1st  my anniversary  congratulations  but i'm saying

[02:24:00]  sirius 205 xm 121  how is that on our  channel who the  fuck is so out of  touch with our show  that that's on our  channel yeah because  we talked to much  different people first  yeah and he's not  saying live from new  orleans by the way  that's why i didn't put  him on the list at  first i'm a little uh  might be isdn in some  shit right yeah he  might just be having  an interview with  people who are  yeah he probably is  i don't think he's  there all right  no no he's doing a 
[02:24:30]  guest spot on true  blood he's the  creative consultant for  true blood  he's a technical  consultant yes they  cannot walk during the  day that's crazy no one  would drink blood like  that he would not be  able to resist look at  the reflection in the  mirror such a hack  thing yeah does he 
[02:25:00]  bite next to something  exactly well anyway  speaking of the super  bowl beyonce just  proved to the fucking  world yesterday she could  sing the national anthem  yeah they made her  perform at what press  conference they didn't  make her she just came  out and did it let me  tell you something  didn't quite sound as  good as it did when it  was recorded tell you  that much it also  doesn't answer like there  was no question as to  whether or not she was a  good singer yeah but that 
[02:25:30]  doesn't really answer the  question as to why she  didn't sing in the white  house exactly why are they  asking the question i don't  give a fuck who cares  that's that turns out she  did answer the question she  said and i'm not a beyonce  fan i don't give a fuck  i am i am because in  this in this day and age  they they all do this  it's accepted they've all  decided this is accepted  we've decided it's accepted  because we go to some of  these shows knowing that  they're not singing live for  a lot of the concert yeah  she said that she sang along 
[02:26:00]  to the track right is her  official answer she finally  said that i don't understand  why this fucking world has  some weird shit going on and  they spend so much time on  this who gives a fuck i  don't care it doesn't  matter but they're still  talking about it and now  they're playing this clip  because it happened  yesterday there's some weird  shit going on out there  sorry to interrupt but  somebody sent me a picture  of the serious xm booth  is it nice i think there's  three different places oh 
[02:26:30]  that's great it's twittered  we could absolutely maybe i'll  do my sunday show from radio  row yeah we could still get  you on a plane sam yeah  samuel um you see the  picture that the guy  twittered he yeah i did i  just depressed it right yeah  i did it just brings up a  bigger issue they over they  always cover their ass  still got also they're also  writing jeff foxworthy  promos too but on this show  yeah oh yeah and this wall is 
[02:27:00]  still up where's jeff  foxworthy uh one i bet it's  funny and and like um southern  and he says things like um  you might be a football fan  yeah yeah yeah  why are we making fun of  him he's a bazillionaire off  that dumb bit god whatever  really is an impressive setup  that we've got down there  yeah really impressive of  course we would have been able  to uh do the show does anyone 
[02:27:30]  remember because it's been a  while now like xm we went to  everything i felt like we  were traveling every other  week oh my god right  elo would bring us in  everywhere  ces when we did that in  vegas we used to go out  there for that every year  and then finally they're like  we really want to get you  guys out there so then we  made up let's just go to a  couple cities yeah but then  there's a real reason to get  us out there and they don't  do it  i don't understand yeah would 
[02:28:00]  you guys mind standing  just a bunch of people in  wheelchairs  no  yeah it's just they can't  oh say  flat  can you see  that's okay  someone tried to they doubled  someone was trying to help  her out try to put a little  double around they punch  something on her mic to try  to help her out did they 
[02:28:30]  yeah you can hear it but then  they said no to that  they're adding it  slightly  yeah  they got some reverb on it  oh yeah now you can hear it  at the twilight  reverb smooths out  she's good though  yeah she's all right  you can't use reverb now  no  i'm gonna make a video leave  beyonce a little  i want to hear when it 
[02:29:00]  kicks in  she got the or  grandpas we watched  what  does that even mean  here she comes  okay here we go  she's no whitney houston  it's good though  it's amazing  it's not amazing  yeah it is  no it's not  this is  this is a basic  fucking rendition 
[02:29:30]  it's not  like  amazing  at a press conference  standing at a podium  oh she went high there  that's impressive  stop that shit  that's Sasha Fierce  that's Sasha Fierce  that was terrible right there  oh no that's overuse  blatant overuse  they should have thrown 
[02:30:00]  a flag on that one  high  there it is  a little full set up  nice  how's she gonna end it  of the  brave  the brave  there you go  she can sing  you throw a little shit  on that  in front of 80  80,000 people 
[02:30:30]  she's gonna knock it  out of the front  of course  it would have been funny  if she just changed  the last word  and said home of the Jews  breaking news  breaking news  Alex in D.C.  Alex  Alex  hey fellas  I'm fucking listening  to you guys  about the Super Bowl  covered shit  so I switched over  to fucking Sway  to see what the fuck  he was talking about  talking to Clay Matthews  about how fucking  smooth his goddamn skin is  that's the fucking  bullshit that they got  down to when they  should fucking  have you guys  maybe next year 
[02:31:00]  when it's in  fucking New York  they'll find an excuse  to fucking ship you guys  out of there  no we're not going  next year  that's the serious  fucking  Anthony's looking  Anthony's looking  at the photo  we have no problem  with Sway being down  there by the way  for real  we don't  that's the serious  facility  that's what they  got set up  it's really impressive  they must be  I think  I think they might  be embarrassed  and by the way  all that shit  about them saying  well you're an  expensive show  to have travel  here's why  that's bullshit 
[02:31:30]  because all the  technical stuff  is already  set up  so they wouldn't  have to send  our technical  staff  maybe one of the  guys  so that's bullshit  but a quick look  at this  I would say  that's a couple  hundred thousand  dollars right there  easy  just for the  little  facility  they're absolutely  embarrassed by this  show  this show  they have on the  air because they  understand the demo  they don't want us  across the street  or podcasting  or hurting them  it's almost like  a keep the shit 
[02:32:00]  in this room  thing so it  doesn't leak  out all over  the house  they're embarrassed  by this show  yeah  they're absolutely  embarrassed  look at that  blue carpet  and everything  I know  look at that  carpet  I was thinking  about that too  Sam  they got enough  space to like  not only do they  have the broadcast  setups but there's  enough space to  walk around  like the guests  don't feel  claustrophobic  and closed in  if they just  blew off the  blue carpet  we could have  a new studio  here  you think that's 
[02:32:30]  what it would  take I mean it  was obviously  custom fitted  that's beautiful  that's a beautiful  blue  and we could get  guests from other  shows they just  simply didn't want  us there  it's a hundred  percent what it is  we will be discussing  this wall in two  weeks so that's  good news  what's there to  discuss about it  I don't know  that's what they  told us  you just wanted  to not be there  things are looking  good but we'll  discuss in a couple  weeks  all year they talk  about things like  what can we do  and then we meet  with Scott and  everything and he  asks which is a  viable question like  what can we do  you know we gotta  get you guys out  there  this is out 
[02:33:00]  there  the fucking  Super Bowl  in an amazing  facility they have  set up  over there  it's  and it's all  it's  the listeners  hate this shit  I know they do  do they  yeah I absolutely  know they do  I'm not stupid  I do know they  fucking hate this  shit  but it's  we just have the  wrong people around  us  because  when Scott said  that and we  sort of came up  with ideas  we're like  let's go to a  couple cities  we're hot in 
[02:33:30]  like we've never  been to Chicago  we've never been  to Cleveland  we know  those were fun  and all  don't get me  wrong  I liked  doing it  but if you  have like a  vision  you would think  to yourself  around that  time  okay this is  going to cost  a lot of  money  to send those  guys there  and security  and set it  up  and hotels  and transportation  and flights  and blah blah blah  so if you have  a vision  you would think  to yourself  okay is this  money being  well spent  or should we  wait and make  sure they go 
[02:34:00]  to the Super  Bowl  right  right  yes  because I think  it would be way  more important  to broadcast  a Super Bowl  than Cleveland  or Chicago  yeah  in the end  there was no  reason to go  to those cities  we made it  up  well Jimmy  was filming  his special  but we made  that up  we didn't  have to do  that  we just  kind of piggybacked  what Jimmy  was doing  just to make  it sound  like it made  sense  like we had  to have  meetings  to figure  out  okay  we're in 
[02:34:30]  the city  now what  what's the show  oh god  we didn't even  have a show  right  which is  nerve wracking  by the way  because now  we're in  front of people  expecting some  but we're like  we don't really  have anything  there's no reason  for us to be  here  thank god for  CM Punk  yeah  it was a good  broadcast  but both were  good broadcast  but yeah  it's not like  when you go to  the Superbowl  and you're like  well the event  is here  and now  we don't have to  think about  what we have to do  it's already  right in front of you  and now you've got  to make something  of it  plus it's attaching  yourself to the  biggest story  there is  you want to  you know 
[02:35:00]  as a big show  attach yourself  to what people  are talking about  yeah  there's people  that don't have  a vision for  this channel  or us  and we have  the vision  and we  we suggest  a lot of stuff  and it just  falls flat  every time  it's alright guys  we'll get through  this  I do think  there are times  when Gary  has better  intentions  than  you guys  realize  and then he  just gets  roadblocked  who Gary  how does he 
[02:35:30]  get roadblocked  there's a lot  of roadblocks  around here  you know  I mean  people have  bosses  on bosses  on bosses  on bosses  and things like  who roadblocks  I don't  I don't know  I  I have said  this to Gary's  face off the air  so I have no  problem saying  it on the air  I go Gary  you're a nice  guy  don't take  any of this shit  personally  I like you  as a person  and I also  said I  I know  that you're  very good  at music  but I  don't really  see you  doing anything  for us  that's  that's actually  helping us 
[02:36:00]  push this  whole thing  forward  I've said  that to him  many times  it gets a little  bummed out  and stuff  but I don't  know what else  to say  like there's  obviously a  problem  whether he's  getting the  roadblocks  but I really  don't think  he understands  this type of  radio  he wants to  he's all in  he's kind of  a soldier  but he  doesn't  really  he gets  stuck in  the mud  that's a  beautiful facility  that even  bummed out  Anthony  it's always  the last one  in on this  war  not that 
[02:36:30]  you're not  a pussy  you don't  give a fuck  I just go  with the flow  I'm a go  with the flow  guy  you were the  last one  I have sex  when girls  have their  periods  I was thinking  more of the  keg  or the  tavern  you're always  the last  one in  and I  understand  that about  you  but I saw  your face  when you saw  the facility  you're like  god damn  that would  be nice  you know  here's what  I pictured  and I would  have been  fine with  this  I pictured  a line  of tables  you know  right  and I set  that  right  three tables 
[02:37:00]  right there  well here's  no here's  it looks like  the X  like  yeah X  factor is  what it  looks like  they're going  for that  X factor  the voice  America's Got Talent  type of look  to the  the setup  they got there  there's even  X's  with the lights  I know  you guys  aren't even  seeing  there's the  three  American Idol  judge  setups  here  other side  this right  here is a  basic setup  for two  people  and down  here  is a  casual  couch 
[02:37:30]  cushiony  chair  this is a  broadcast  location  so you can  move that  you can move  the whole  thing to a  more casual  setting  and then  there's the  spotlight  setting  like  holy  fuck  here's  an A-lister  so do  it in front  of everybody  right  yeah I thought  it was just  going to be  a line of  tables  why are we  part of  any of this  because they're  embarrassed by  this show  but we're never  part of any  of this  because they'll  have an  excuse for  this as  well  trust me  they're  embarrassed  they're  to pay  for the  carpet  I'm telling  you what  it is  they will  have an  excuse  and I  will say  nope  sorry  not good  enough  once again 
[02:38:00]  I will  say that  and  there's a  million  events that  we're not  associated  with  we've never  been part  of a big  event with  this company  when we  were on  just XM  we were  went to  CES  every year  they didn't  send us  to the  Super Bowl  either  but  no  XM was  embarrassed  by us  too  but not  as bad  not as  bad  right  because  Elo  liked us  Scott likes  us  but I  think he  likes us  in the way  that he  likes  anything  that's not  bothering  him at  the moment  I don't  think he  likes us  I don't  even know  and it's  special  I have no  idea 
[02:38:30]  I don't  know either  way  oh man  that bummed  you out  you like  this set  up a lot  I could  picture it  you know  we're there  we're hanging  out  and to me  this logo  here looks  like a  video screen  yeah  which means  I think  you can  put up  you know  imagine  an Opie  and Anthony  show right  there  that's what  you do  by the way  for a show  that you  consider  valuable  but I  saw the  list of  shows  they can't  possibly  think those  shows are  valuable  no they  can't 
[02:39:00]  they can't  possibly think  that  which table  do you think  Mark says  hi is going  to sit  at  we would  have been  on at 6  to 10  are they  doing morning  show interviews  I guess  they are  the mashups  there  but is there  celebrities out  in the morning  doing press  I guess so  yeah I'm sure  because Sway's  doing his show  plus we could  always go and  tape shit  in the afternoons  no we would  just flip it  if we had to  and just do  afternoons  who cares  we would do  it whenever  it made sense  I mean if you  find out Troy  Aikman's walking  around at 3 o'clock  you'll probably  do some shit  Troy  yo Troy 
[02:39:30]  here he is  come on  here he is  take a seat  Troy Aikman  sitting down  yeah and then  what  on the couch  you'd be in the  casual  we're here  so Troy  that time you  threw that  pass the  fucking  Emmett  caught it  I was like  fuck  that's right  fuck  that'd be great  well Ann  at least you're  going to be  watching the  Super Bowl  on a  is it really  a hundred inch  or is it  90 inch  it's 90 
[02:40:00]  Ann got a  90 inch  TV  delivery  Jesus Christ  that's like  10 of my  dicks  90 inches  did you post  pictures yet  a couple  you know  pictures  do not  do it  justice  you can't  really  that's the  guy  delivering it  one of the  guys  the box  is taller  than him  yeah the  box is  actually  obnoxious  taller than  the guy  it was  very large  how do you  explain that 
[02:40:30]  very large  box  that guy's  got to be  six foot  tall right  yeah he was  just under  six  all right  so the  box is  probably  six foot  high  yeah  you didn't  leave the  box outside  right  oh I  left it  outside  just like  no they  took it  away  they hauled  it  away  yeah you  don't want  to advertise  outside your  house that  that what  was in this  box is in  that house  the only thing  my neighbors  would do is  run out and  get one also  so they  aren't the  one on the  block that  doesn't have  it  keep it up  with the  fucking  joneses  my mother  would always  say  keep it up  with the  fucking  bernsteins 
[02:41:00]  the kumias  yeah so  they delivered  that about  nine o'clock  last night  wow  and  late delivery  no  yeah late  delivery but  you know what  they knew I  needed it  no I wanted  it right  away and  they knew I  was gonna  grease them a  little bit with  some fucking  benjamins  yeah I gave  him a hundred  it's supposed to  be the guy  comes to the  door and he's  like uh yeah  this was only  curbside delivery  you know where  they took it  off the truck  are you kidding  me you gotta  take it in  yeah yeah but  it's like I 
[02:41:30]  already had the  hundred in my  hand when I  answered the  door and I  was like yeah  let me open up  this other door  he goes oh  yeah it's  curbside delivery  I just went  flock I put  it right in his  hand I'm like  there you go  he goes well  now we're  talking yeah  right away  you both  understood the  game oh  exactly and  he was like  all right we  you know we'll  take it out of  the box here and  take away all the  cardboard and the  pallet and  everything like  that nice and  yeah so they did  all that brought  it in and then  me and me and 
[02:42:00]  Vinny Vinny and  I Vinny and I  Vinny and I  went through the  motions of getting  the thing installed  you but you the  two of you mounted  it yeah yeah like  jumped on it pulled  my dick out and  started humping it  I mounted it  these things are  light now it's  about 100 pounds  was it on the  wall heavier than  yeah I put it  where the old one  was it will hold  the new one yeah  it's 175 pound  mount and I was  surprised as fuck  that the mount that  came off my other  TV screwed right on  the back of this  one and hung it  right the fuck up 
[02:42:30]  I was stunned that  it worked like that  I can't wait until  Sunday morning Anthony  is awakened by what  sounds like a  fucking piano being  thrown through a  bay window  that's exactly what  we were kind of  goofing about too  how awful it would  be if it fell off  the wall but  Vinny's pretty  proficient in  electronics so got  the Denon receiver  and everything and  all the HDMI 3D  cables and all the 
[02:43:00]  good shit you need  for this and wired  it all up oh it's  3D indeed does it  hook up to like  VCRs and shit oh  yeah it's hooked up  to VCR a fucking  it's wonderful I have  a top loader oh  yeah top loader VCR  it's fantastic yeah  so brought it in put  the mount up did  everything popped it  up on the wall and  it is ridiculous big I  was I was laughing at  how silly it looked up  on that wall yeah  picture silly yeah  pictures don't do it  justice is it bad for 
[02:43:30]  your health can't  fucking no you got to  get a person in front  that's why you didn't  do it right yeah but  even that doesn't do  it you don't think I  think I know I don't  think I posted a picture  of I posted that that'll  help your old Twitter  account today I'll I'll  take a picture when I  get home because it's  up on the wall it's real  nice now and then we  hooked everything up and  then flip that fucker on  and did some 3D and I  looked at avatar I put a  little bit of avatar look  it looked amazing oh it  looks 3D fucking 3D is 
[02:44:00]  insane on this thing it's  insane and I took a  picture of my TV with  the intention of replying  to your tweet with this  box and I was just too  ashamed I couldn't do it  oh but you do it to  yourself Sam I know you  don't make a lot of money  I'll say it again I'll  say it every time this  comes up you do it to  yourself you could have  got a much bigger TV man  right I just I'm just  hoping that Al Sharpton  says something really  really bad on that 90  oh you think and you 
[02:44:30]  either fucking I  wouldn't become it  become a not  responsible gun owner  and blast a few rounds  through the or pick up  whatever the fuck is  around and throw it at  your 90 inch TV no do  they do they go bigger  than 90 inch at this  point no no not really  at a consumer level not  really that's about it the  cost goes ridiculous yeah  then the cost gets really  crazy too but the 3d they  got the what a fuck load 
[02:45:00]  of glasses they're the  active glasses you know  where you've got to flip  them on not like the  regular ones at the movie  theater and this shit was  just like fucking the  depth in it I watched  the end of the Avengers  all fucking 3d and shit  when they're fighting and  all that crap  un-fucking-believably the  way it looks it's crystal  clear like like you're  looking at the faces and  it's every details there  in 3d it's not like  blurry and shit can you  use those glasses on like  all 3d TVs or I would  think if it's an active 
[02:45:30]  3d sure yeah I mean why  not but uh it just  everything fucking from  3d to just watching like  huge size Seinfeld was  pretty fucking but uh for  Super Bowl it'll be great  you know we've got some  people coming over and uh  you know that'll because  some people go down into  the theater downstairs to  watch some people at the  bar area to watch that  but a lot of people stay  upstairs and watch on  that TV and the TV was  never big enough for the  room how big was it  man it's like just under 
[02:46:00]  a what's just under a 60  59  all right it might have  been a don't ask Phil  Nicholson  honestly what was the  question I just under a  60 yeah Anthony  oh my god I think I was  55 55 you fucking guy  really don't have like a  58 or something like a 50  whatever it is it's just  under 60 and um yeah yeah 
[02:46:30]  but uh now I'm thinking I  I do now have more TVs than  rooms you know and I'm  probably gonna do a  switcheroo how many TVs you  got I don't even know  anymore every room has one  except for the princess room  upstairs every other room  has television in it I got  four do you what do you  still have I still have that  one from K-Rock in my  bedroom that Panasonic I  use that one in my uh  compound uh West that's not  a great TV it's okay it's not 
[02:47:00]  a good TV it's not a good  TV yeah that's why I'm  probably gonna all right  know what happened to my K-Rock  TV I was ready to do the  right thing and give it to one  of my family members down in  Philly I had it off the wall  ready for uh to put it in my  old car and drive it down  there and uh well the kid got  that one what happened  slammed he tipped it over  could have hurt himself oh my  god kids they always could have  hurt himself things and the  screen was busted I still  brought it down like well it's  a crack maybe you could get it 
[02:47:30]  fixed oh thanks felt like such a  loser you could get it fixed  well I didn't know what to do  oh oh to be honest I just  remember the story I didn't  know it was broke until I got  down there and we're I'm all  excited like presenting it and  we're pulling it out of the  truck me and him like here you  go you know here's a little nice  TV for you and then there you  saw the big fucking crack you  know you should I do remember  that it tipped over in the room  and I thought it was okay you  should have just bought him a TV  at that point well what do you  think oh did you oh no you're 
[02:48:00]  on the hook for a TV oh no I'll  buy you one no dude you don't  have to no you gotta do it oh  man I was thinking if I take  the old TV and put it in my  bedroom yeah and then take the  bedroom TV and put it downstairs  in the basement there's the new  karaoke screen right and take the  karaoke screen one and I don't  know what I could do with that 
[02:48:30]  one you should put two TVs next to  each other somewhere that'd be  good so you can watch two shows  that'd be pretty fucking cool yeah  give it to Sam I'd be rock star  Sam wouldn't even use it it'd  probably be like oh it's to use  too much energy for my fucking  power bill exactly this TV has one  of these features I got to fucking  disable it it's a fairness what is  it's tolerance yeah there's a color  color balance properly a breathalyzer 
[02:49:00]  sorry yeah you gotta breathe into it  before you use it it's got these  little leaves that show up on the  bottom like it looks like volume but  they're little leaves to show how much  energy you're using oh it's a green  yeah like it could be but you want to  like I want to tweak it so it's fucking  like I want it spewing out coal fumes  you want you want it to look like  it's fall yes I was like I want dead  animals to show up on the bottom but  I'm using so much fucking energy yeah 
[02:49:30]  so I got I got that again fucking I'm  very excited to play call of duty on it  that's good and then I hear a black ops  one is available in 3d to play in 3d  nice which I want to try that out but I  think just a call of duty on on a 90  on a 90 inch it's got to be pretty  goddamn awesome yeah you gotta you  gotta shoot some video or pictures oh  yeah me yelling fuck a knife again  fucking little shit I got you I was 
[02:50:00]  shooting you 20 times that's me  scary movies are gonna be so scary on  that TV very scary especially 3d they  come right out at you ah what do I do  ah how many glasses did you get I got  eight pairs of glasses can you buy more  yeah always buy more buy more anything  you like the biggest and the most I like  the biggest and the most Sam that's  right what a size whore you'd be if you  were gay all you'd be doing is buy an

[02:51:00]  that's fine uh do you get is it hot no  why would it be like doesn't it radiate a  lot of no no it's cool as a cucumber  remember the old days getting one of  those fucking like 38 inch TVs with the  tubes and you'd need like four guys  trying to move it yeah two people  hanging a 90 inch television up on the  wall and it was it was nothing well you  remember the old Nageltron had to get  left in our old apartment because it was 
[02:51:30]  like a 32 inch tube TV right the Nageltron  and we were like we're not moving it we  just left it face down I remember the  Nageltron in the old apartment yeah yeah  probably wait I mean Eric we lifted  that thing I really weighed 120 pounds  damn it that's a lot the back of your  car sunk down and almost straight yeah  straight as he was leaving anyway for the  TV  that's a good one oh Jesus Christ and it

[02:57:00]  13  14  14  15  15  very briefly um and nikki nikki i know um nikki there we go hello how are you  how are you congratulations on the new show nikki and sarah live tuesdays at 11 p.m on mtv  thank you you just walk in here and go like guys no like you're smelling smelly guys it  smells really good in here does it you're the first person ever says i don't know if it's this 
[02:57:30]  mic or what but it's very uh it's hit or miss in here because we've had people come in here go it  smells like a fucking locker room and then other people come in yeah it smells nice usually it  smells nice after a guest because it's no one in here believe me jimmy's usually far and have to  show yeah i do spend a good amount of time doing that i think they spray the um the mics in the  morning though because we would complain there's something on this yeah oh that's to just get rid  of all the bad breath that came before you it's sickening nikki i was just talking about you  because we're the final episode of 30 rock was last night yeah and i follow you on twitter 
[02:58:00]  and your 30 rock tweet made me laugh oh thanks 30 rock was my favorite show i sneezed once during  an episode i missed seven jokes that's funny that's what i like they like squeezing a lot of  fucking jokes in you gotta pay attention yes thank you but it went away last night final episode i  didn't see it you didn't see it not yet i was telling travis that uh tina face said goodbye to  tracy morgan and a strip club and it and uh my wife turned to me went that was real like it was 
[02:58:30]  like they said just just you know tell me what you think of me like you're seeing me for the last  time because tina was basically saying stuff like well you're hard to work with but i'm gonna mission  and we all all right yeah it almost sounded a little too real that it wasn't uh someone making  that up in the in the writer's room yeah i'm tired of you telling me that you're gonna get me  pregnant it's a crazy thing so how did the first show go for you guys it was great it was great 
[02:59:00]  it was wild hell yeah oh yeah i mean it was it's live i know that's why yeah we were super nervous  yeah um yeah when they started we were standing right by the control room a few minutes before and  i heard someone scream out like three minutes to live and i was just like oh god yeah it's horrifying  just the countdown part was it does not help your heart and we had one fan on the street in in time  square outside you know it's like the tRL studio and i'm used to we're used to seeing on tRL like  you know thousands of girls yeah we had one girl with a sign i was expecting nothing so when i saw her 
[02:59:30]  i was like oh my gosh yeah it made me feel better yeah so you had that one fan out there and look  you got to get two fans for next week yeah let's go for two yeah let's build a little build  a bunch of ona fans if you're like wow all of a sudden there's 300 guys they've got one woman  the radio show yeah you'll know if there are fans certainly why are you going out live because it's  not that it's a bad thing to do but it's really scary i've done it once and it's frightening it's 
[03:00:00]  also freeing though because you know that they have to air what you say yeah yeah and once you're done  you're done you know it's kind of like stand up like i don't have to like reassess and be like what  should we cut like it's just i feel free or yeah there's a more of a forgiving you know if you trip  up a line you know it's it's understood it's part of the charm of it but i think uh they wanted to go  live because they wanted people to tune in when it was let's watch them fuck up yeah yeah instead of  it yeah it's fun watching live shows you know there's something that might happen did you pitch 
[03:00:30]  it as a live show or did they say hey look will why don't we just do this live they had already  gotten the green light and then they just called us a month before production started and they were like  we have news oh boy yeah and we were like whoa what's the show about we should get that out there  for the people that don't know sarah uh mickey take this one um it's it it's a talk show late night  talk show it's definitely geared towards a younger audience so that we're doing pop culture jokes 
[03:01:00]  about you know justin bieber and taylor swift like the big pop stars yeah um and then we have  celebrity guests and sketches and you know it's it's a pretty standard talk show stuff but i think  it's a little different because it's two of us yeah um we're girls you guys had cash i see that  how was she is she a mess in real life no she was pretty together she came out and i was like whoa  this is a rock star like the clothes she had on and the hair everything she just looked intimidating 
[03:01:30]  but then as soon as she started talking i was like yeah she's just chill isn't it a weird vibe  isn't it weird when a celebrity walks in there's a really weird air they carry  about like you know for me it's ozzy but there's plenty of celebrities i've met that smell there's  something about them it's like where do you get your clothes that the whole room just smells like  leather or sways you always worry i guess you don't shop at the gap yeah like the rest of us 
[03:02:00]  where do you go for these groovy clothes but there's something they carry with them it's  always their colognes though like what the fuck i don't we don't get to smell that shit when we're  trying to find a new cologne i interviewed rob halford in a green room and i literally i understood  why people fuck rock stars after shows like i wasn't attracted to them but i'm like it's that you  walk in it's that smell of that person you've probably had some luck believe me i wish i had a  better example to give you i know right where you go i have no idea who that is who's the lead  singer judith priest okay all right he's out he's out he's gay came out of the closet see if your show 
[03:02:30]  was on 30 years ago it would be a pop culture reference exactly everybody you have on we would  go that's music that's the younger demo yeah we have jenny mccarthy this week oh okay yeah yeah  and kind of bridges all generations oh yes taylor swift i saw you saying that you'd be willing to  beg to get her yeah i would love to get her you'd probably get her yeah i think eventually  like like why though like just as a straight interview or you want to like ask her something 
[03:03:00]  weird do you like her like i'm a big fan of her music or her as yeah i like her vibe i think she's  very pretty yeah she's so pretty going out on a limb yeah and um i'm controversial i like that  she's growing up in front of our eyes and she doesn't seem she seems to be handling it okay  the thing you love is the thing he hates she's hitting womanhood you just hear a fucking tear  come down when they bleed so does my heart  and she can't keep a guy yeah i relate to that i think that she's like she's younger than me but i 
[03:03:30]  feel like we're on the same trajectory like for our romantic life and so when she writes the song i'm  like i just went through that too so i uh oh wow does she have a song called uh i dated a no  shoulder to comic now i'm friends with nikki i would never bring up something i knew off the air  but joe mentioned it on the show they did a web series based on it you did oh okay i didn't even 
[03:04:00]  know that i i saw the web series i liked it a lot that's beyond me what we're talking about of course  nikki glazer went out with joe de rosa which i don't get at all you seem like uh well you seem like  a nice pretty girl that must have been during your blue period despicable what i've what i've  uh gotten from hanging out with uh mr de rosa is uh i don't find that he's very fond of women  yeah uh i i girlfriend now though well he does i know are you jealous really i mean okay well 
[03:04:30]  uh no i'm happy for him but we have been hanging out a lot more and and i was wondering like what  what's gonna happen like will it xx xx no no no no none of that damn none of that but i you know  he he told me and it was like oh god you got it was more of a jealousy like oh you got it together  before i did oh yeah yeah yeah that's the worst yeah so i'm i'm happy for him though but he's charming 
[03:05:00]  i mean i was really trying to think about it coming in here because i thought it might come up when i i  would always say like whenever i saw joe around nikki i was like nikki he likes you so much like  you know i just always thought he pursued me and not many people treated her really nice i i saw  him going for it joe gets joe gets women by basically the equivalent of the hand please please  oh god please all right already yes oh boy he's like a brush fire he's just like all right 
[03:05:30]  kind of respect to rosa wow yeah well no and i won't say joe is like misogynistic or anything like  that i'm just saying like i've seen him in confrontations with girls and he the second  it it turns into anything he goes a hundred percent yeah like fuck you you kind of fucking  whore screamed at more really by him wow when we broke up i mean you do this you guys you do this  oh man he called everyone afterwards and was like yeah i'm a bad person oh fuck how long did 
[03:06:00]  you date like off and on for i don't know like maybe six months or something oh that's it off  and on for six months it was how do you off and on for six months that's the easy period that's like  either an on or an off six months is easy i it was it should have been by the way he said you guys  were together eight months did he really i don't know oh my god i would say less i don't know he  it got to the point where he thought we i boy were boyfriend and girlfriend and i didn't know 
[03:06:30]  and um and and that was where it got rupert pumpkin had a better relationship with jerry langford  oh shit so but you used how long after until you became friends or stayed friends it was  uh a year and a half we did not speak it was the i've never had that with anyone we'd see each  other at shows and he would just ignore me and and we yeah it was bad and then we were both on  uh red eye together and um it was we're love blossoms fucking red eye oh you still weren't 
[03:07:00]  talking when you went on red eye we were in the green room and it was really tense and then i was  just like i i just asked i was like how are you i tried to start a conversation and he was  receptive and then he i was like let's hang out after this like i want to be friends again and um  and now we we are i would instantly be like she wants to fuck again yeah if a girl goes like i  would let's hang out i want to be friends i'm like yeah wanted to oh shit really that didn't it didn't  end up that didn't happen but if he if he would have like pushed it a little bit yeah that always 
[03:07:30]  works with me yeah oh man that's what i mean what's your poison by the way well uh what do you mean  uh drink wise i don't drink what because you were with joe and you don't drink well i did with  joe oh okay nice joe is coming up it's all yelling now joe has said more to rehab than fucking  heroin it's all making sense though joe is her bottom show what you do to nikki yeah oh man did 
[03:08:00]  you sober up uh yeah i did oh okay good for you wow damn how long uh it's been over a year 14  i mentioned that because jimmy's 26 years today oh my gosh today thank you and i want to make sure  we acknowledge that in a serious way yeah i know it's pretty cool man i i wouldn't have mentioned  it on the air actually because i forget sometimes but then i'm like i'm just bitching today drinking  yeah exactly it did really yeah i'll sneak a few every once in a while i want four month benders  but uh wow so you actually quit for real after dating joe yeah well it wasn't just joe it was like i was 
[03:08:30]  getting into a lot of relationships based on having sex with people too soon because i was wasted  and then suddenly i would be fucking rehab and i wouldn't even really like them and i would be  what got me into this and it was like i know sounds fantastic now it's really hard to have sex  with someone being so i don't know how to do it yeah really now i really don't jesus nikki would react  to me like now the way she probably should yeah no i don't think alcohol's amazing 
[03:09:00]  alcohol rules i do miss that sex and booze how long have you guys known each other  about two years yeah a little over two years how did you two pitch a show together like especially  not knowing each other that long um because people in this room we've known each other for what  fucking 13 years yeah we can't we can't get a fucking show off the ground how do you how do you  have to do what happens um well we were doing this we didn't know each other we just started our  podcast um just like you seem cool let's do a podcast and we just started it and we got to know 
[03:09:30]  each other on the podcast um you had to be there and um we just had this vibe it was sort of natural  chemistry that just came out of nowhere i don't know and then uh we came up with a show idea and  pitched it and we wrote some videos and it all just happened i don't know i compare it to like  meeting the one i met nikki and it was like meeting my comedic one wow you know it's just an instant 
[03:10:00]  connection um and we kind of approach things you know because we didn't know each other that well  we had natural healthy boundaries and we're professionals first and then friends later right  so there's an article because we know about nikki's personal life but there's i literally just read  that you you you want you've won emmys because you wrote for for fallon yeah um and you're 57 000 in  debt yeah is it what what is this article from we just have to print it out it's that's probably  from okay my boyfriend um scott moran is a comedian and filmmaker and he has a web series called modern 
[03:10:30]  comedian and he profiles a comedian every episode and he did mine was about how i've amassed this amount  of debt oh okay um and that's it was getting some write-ups about it but um yeah i i got my mom  died i got divorced and then things spiraled out of control how did you turn into the girl that got  divorced and didn't get any money so you get money when you get uh i i am the one that wanted the  divorce and there was nothing to split up really but it was just an emotional downward spiral and my 
[03:11:00]  way of handling it was was um by spending money that i didn't have oh and um nice credit cards and  you know i was living alone for the first time and didn't understand how expensive that was and i was  just didn't know a lot of stuff about anything and wow oh i'm still under it and so this show we have  it's like i'm not gonna enjoy any of the money for a while oh yeah i have to get out of this  paying some bills that's the first thing you do though when you get success like i got a bit of 
[03:11:30]  credit card debt at one point too it's i think everyone does and then all of a sudden you know  you're okay when when you finally get that paid down you're like oh okay yeah i was 23 grand in  debt when i got the job up in uh massachusetts there yeah and that's what 95 and and i didn't  have any money it took a little while but i was able to like pay off big chunks of it and then i was  like the last check i wrote i was like holy shit i don't have this credit card debt i just assumed i  would still to this day be paying off that credit card which i only used for things i needed like a jet ski 
[03:12:00]  yeah i did and a a fucking camcorder to videotape me on the jet ski it was fucking important shit  that was me too i was like i got to where i was like i have never had my own tv that's nice and  then comes the rationalizing this tv i could buy i deserve this yeah i deserve this i've been through  hell you know i just went crazy when you have the just the basic financial means even if it is just 
[03:12:30]  through credit cards and you know you're going to be fucked but you know that you can get this  you sit and think about it and you go like like y'all you start chuckling to yourself like i'm gonna  get it i should you don't fuck it i'll be fine i'm gonna make a million dollars in like a year  it'll be fine you know i kept thinking and dead everyone knows you're dead who cares about fucking  dead i don't care it's gonna fuck my whole life up fuck this i'm getting it it's when you don't have  enough money to pay to pay the minimums is when it starts to get really scary you're just paying 
[03:13:00]  the interest it's crazy the amount of money i've wasted oh on just i don't like to think about it  really makes me sick yeah you know i got i got i used to see this do these escorts and i and i  would pay with a credit card i was a younger man that's exactly how that was almost what i said  i wish i never uttered those words you want to see how they swipe it magical  but i uh they wound up they they wound up chalking up like 10 grand on each card 
[03:13:30]  wow but it was like they both they stole it from me so i had to call the credit card company oh man  and they assumed that no one would call the credit card company on a dispute they didn't know they  were dealing with the kid i'm like look these were hookers i didn't unscrupulous whores yeah  wow i was i was surprised but here's why i asked you because you were a financial this is what  it said uh that you worked as a financial analyst at a securities fraud yeah law firm like right 
[03:14:00]  across the street from here wow i calculated damages in big cases like enron and world comm oh wow i  don't i don't there's something wrong in my brain are you an attorney or are you no i just uh got a job  through a friend and and they taught me how to do this and i i could do it and so i did it for like  five years while i was trying to do comedy at night you would calculate uh damages i would take like  stock trades and like i didn't know anything about it i did not major in any i majored in english and 
[03:14:30]  theater i just was taught how to do it and i could do it and um i now have this weird skill that is very  niche yeah right um but yeah i would take you know stock trades and figure out how much money  that the investor had lost on a company being fraudulent and lying wait is that so that's taking  the like let's just say you buy something at a dollar and now it's about 50 cents you've lost 50 cents  so it's an easy subtraction thing it's not that difficult of a concept if you understand basic 
[03:15:00]  algebra but you would have to go in there and figure out how much the fraud actually cost how much  the entire class so like all the investors so worldcom was had um lied about their financials  the stock price was inflated is this what the show's like yes  because i have never lived i've never retained it when you talk about it  but yeah anyway so  that would be a great half oh my god 
[03:15:30]  and then now if they shorted the stock  how long would you watch  it's a different type of calculation  this is fashion  even if they were completely naked you would only watch for a couple minutes  that would be such a great show  yeah i just talk about that with my tits out  it's a great show  on mtv if they just did that and they said we just nothing but stock  talk about it  so okay so you would uh  whose fault was the housing collapse  oh that thing i was out of that stuff 
[03:16:00]  uh from what i can tell um old rich men  really that's what i blame everything on  oh man  but um no i think the housing thing was because uh they were doing those like crazy swaps and i mean  i was in that world a little bit i understood it you know when it was explained to me i understood it but  yeah i think it was people  gambling with money that didn't exist  i think it was that guy from the commercial where it's like uh when your bank says no champion says yes  joseph goreyeb  and meanwhile there's a reason the other bank said no 
[03:16:30]  because you can't pay the fucking thing  you're the guy that buys the fucking jet skis on the credit card  you can't afford the house  i'm like why is it on the sats that like you know we all know what a rhombus is to learn to pass sats but you don't have to know what apr stands for  it's so stupid  it's a rhombus but for the listeners  a rhombus is a  it's sort of  it's sort of like a  sideways rectangle  it's like a little squished up rectangle  it's all fucking crooked 
[03:17:00]  i've never heard of a rhombus  i have  take a rectangle  and guess but then you go like this  to the side  oh that's  how do you know  that's a rhombus  it's a triangle  he didn't even graduate high school  he knows that shit  it's if you went  took this and then you like  made this  yeah that's what i think it is  but you're saying it's the other one  no no  it's this way  it's that  it's that one  you gotta collapse  you gotta collapse the walls a little bit  to the side  what's the flat top pyramid  quadrangle  quadrangle  quadrangle  quadrangle 
[03:17:30]  i like a good quadrangle  yeah  oh my gosh  as soon as you're done with the SATs  the point is  you don't need half that shit  yeah  it's a trapezoid  show me how to handle credit cards  oh man  who made these names up  they're weird  i know  i haven't heard quadrangle  quadrangle  i'll meet you at the quadrangle  how did you guys make this a show  by the way  i was asking about  did you go to mtv  uh yeah  we set up a meeting  with them  damn  um  we had been working on the idea  for the show 
[03:18:00]  and we had  two meetings  one with another network  and one with mtv  and we were  i guess  i was kind of feeling like  that was like  we're just getting started  these people aren't gonna want it  this is a big long process  yeah  i'd never pitched anything  so i was like  this is just  a learning experience  yeah  oh  we won't get it  but this is good for us  right  yeah  it's teaching us how  mtv was like  this is exactly what we want  what  holy shit  is it weird to hear those words  i've never heard that  oh jimmy  they don't say it like that 
[03:18:30]  i mean they're like  uh-huh  like you can tell  and their eyes are like  glistening a little  when you're talking  their body language  is like  i think i like what i'm hearing  and then  oh do you sense that  when you're pitching it  yes  you can tell  when they're not into it  tap dancing your asses off  we walked in  and just jump in the elevator  together  yeah  we're like  i have a good feeling  about this  but then you say  the one thing  that defeats them  like they're happy  and then at the end  we bash the jews  thanks for coming in  but i don't know 
[03:19:00]  we can change it  it was awesome  that's doers though  we were talking before  about like  getting stuck in the mud  career wise  and talking and doing  but that's what doers are  like they've been doing it for  i hate to use that corny expression  but for two years  you have a podcast or whatever  and now you get a fucking show  on mtv  that's amazing  we've been here eight years  that's amazing  and well  we're podcasting too  okay  this is our podcast  this is our podcast  right here  don't give up  you know 
[03:19:30]  the only advice  i can give to you  is stick with it  it's gonna work out  if you really believe  in yourself  ah fuck  believe in myself  i want other people  to believe  myself is easy  exactly  believing in me  is easy  the fact is  no other people  follow  no one follows you  hey  so you guys  do interviews  what else do you do  on the show  because amy said  it's great  i haven't seen  the first episode  but amy raved  about it  like privately  she's like  it's fucking great  oh that's nice  yeah it's uh  we do like 
[03:20:00]  weekend update  style jokes  at the top of the show  about the week  and pop culture  is it you two sitting  you don't  we're standing  it looks like  access hollywood  kind of  it looks like  an entertainment  little green screening  um no  the backdrop  is times square  we're in the whole  TRL studio  oh that's right  the TRL studio  yeah  is there an audience  with you  yeah  audience  live audience  i feel like  we're doing  it's weird  because our  head writer  is brian mccann  who is at  um  conan for 17  years  so there's  this like  sprinkling of  absurdity in 
[03:20:30]  there  with like  a very  um  access hollywood  content base  you know  like  um  which i think  makes it  kind of  different  and then  we have  some man  on the street  stuff  and we're  gonna be  having some  sketches  and parodies  and um  i mean  it's  it's fluff  we're not  you know  trying to  change  i mean  i'm trying  to change  what's mtv is  yeah  wait till you get  that  on mtv  they haven't  done it in a while  so  you're an influence  on people  why don't you  use that 
[03:21:00]  in the responsible  shut up  yeah  i love that one  you know  you have the ear  of a lot of people  and you just  yeah  because that's me  i'm not that deep  i'm an idiot  you tweet  yeah  yeah  how do you  uh how the tweeters  uh treat you  they're i  they're they've been  nice i mean  there's some  haters  yeah of course  a couple times  bitches  because i have  one tooth  that's slightly  sticking out  further than the  other are you 
[03:21:30]  crazy  it's uh  one of those  um  it's one of  those odd  cute things  they pick up  on every  and they're  like using it  as evidence  as to why  i don't deserve  a tv show  can you believe  they put someone  with a snaggle  tooth on there  you really can't  tell  your names are  hard to spell  by the way  nikki glazer  with an s  and sarah shaffer  with an a e  no one's gonna get  that  my name is  never spelled  correctly  because people  think they know  how to spell it 
[03:22:00]  they probably  spell it glasser  do you think  on twitter  they try to  find the one  flaw or something  like that  and then just  make it into  more than it  is  oh please  constantly  those bitches  i've already  called my dentist  i'm getting  this tooth fixed  you best  yeah  do you do  do you respond  to them  what do you do  there are a few  levels of response  that i usually go  through  the first one is  if the guy's got  like no followers  or anything  yeah  but he's following  you and he's  just bashing  he's got three  tweets that are  dedicated to  bashing you  i'll direct  message back 
[03:22:30]  and say  hey you  fucking asshole  you're not even  worth like  retweeting  i'm just telling  you that you  know you're no  longer followed  and your  mother is a  whore  and things like  and i'll send  that out  and then block  so he's got  no recourse  if someone has  a lot of  followers  then you gotta  be a little  more clever  you go into  finding his  old tweets  links  pictures  instagram  facebook  find his  family  his wife  his kids  and then point  out how  fucking ugly 
[03:23:00]  they are  how his wife's  a fat pig  how she probably  fucked the guy  that she's following  on facebook  it takes a lot  of research  i've literally  had people  remove their  accounts from  twitter  because then  once you do  that and i'm  done  the listeners  take over  and they are  ruthless  that's one of  the greatest  i did one of  those yesterday  they're great  takes a little  research  i had a golf  tweet so this  guy calls me  a fag  and i go to  his twitter  page and  there's a  picture of  him and  literally a  beast 
[03:23:30]  which i guess  was his wife  so i kind  of attacked  that picture  and told him  to shut  his fucking  trap  yeah some  guy it's  always like  hey you're  faggy fag  fag  and and  then this  one guy  had muscle  man pictures  like on his  site and i'm  like you know  if you're gonna  call someone a  fag you better  get rid of the  muscle man  picture  exactly why  he's calling  too much  exactly he  loves  he's yeah  he loves  man on man  sex  he's throwing  it in the  water  maybe he's

[03:35:30]  no  how is  how is he out there  what  how is he out there  well  he can't hear this  it's not out there  the only awkward thing is  they came up too early  they came up too early right  okay yeah  cause i'm talking to eric griffin  in a little bit  i fucking love the show he's on  you do  i love workaholics  alright so you can hang out for a second  he's on the show workaholics  what about you intern  do you like workaholics  i don't have tv  you don't have tv  oh you fucking  these hipster kids nowadays  troy's the same  i don't have tv  i don't want  why wouldn't you have a tv 
[03:36:00]  or troy has a tv  but it's not even fucking plugged in  he doesn't use it for anything  oh i can turn it on  bro  there's nothing on  why i have no cable  why don't you have a tv  uh  it's cause i'm moving around  so many  so much since i'm in college  i don't  what do you mean you're moving around so much  you go from home  to dorm  or even ipad  look at netflix  the tv things  shows  is that when you say tv things  you're talking about the shows  yeah  yeah  i'm just going through a lot of no's right now  you're going through a lot of no's  a lot of uh  d and the a's 
[03:36:30]  yeah i mean  dicks in the asses  dicks in the asses  why don't you have a tv  intern  what's your name alan  yeah  alan thick  uh  i can't even call him alan thick anymore  sal he doesn't have a tv  it's can lick  can lick  yeah  can lick my ass  if he doesn't have a tv  you ever hear that before  uh  since i've been in the sixth grade  here and there once or twice  okay  yeah  so why don't you have a tv  alan can lick my ass  uh  well  i mean it's  a combination of things  like my parents won't let me buy one 
[03:37:00]  because they're like  we're spending like  close to 50  uh  50 grand  uh  a semester for you to go to your school  your parents won't allow you to buy a tv  yeah  why don't you get a job  and get a  why don't you get a job alan  which school do you go to  which school are you going to  i go to fordham university  okay  i think that's where travis went if i'm not mistaken  and also  lick my ass  i just wanted to say it  i know  it's fun isn't it  yeah  is there uh  any  are there any pictures of travis  as like an esteemed alumnus  hanging up anywhere  uh 
[03:37:30]  nah  i mean he  he does work for the opian anthony's  you know travis right  i know travis  right  so you must be very excited  i think you went to fordham  you did  you said why  you see the picture  no i  i'm i  i said that as a question  i mean i work at the radio station  over there  and i don't see anything about him over there  um  obviously they don't have their shit together do they  or maybe the fluffer wall  so your  your parent  the fluffer wall  you're saying that he fluffed men in college  you heard about that too  you  your parents won't let you buy a tv  no  why  they think that i'm just gonna sit down 
[03:38:00]  and play video games all day with my buddies  is that what you do  i mean i do it on my computer but  you know they can't control that  why don't they let you buy a tv and just not an xbox  well i already have a  well  the thing is like my roommate  uh last year actually had a tv  and so i brought my piece  that must have been very exciting for you  well it was excellent  i played video games all day with my friends  it's like i'm back to the future  and he goes yeah i've seen this on a rerun  and you were like what's a rerun  wasn't like that  uh  no no 
[03:38:30]  it was  it was more along the lines of uh  how come your parents are dictating  whether or not you can buy a tv  why don't you just like  why don't you get it  as i said before  why don't you get a job alan  and buy and then use the money from the job  to buy a television  you can get them cheap  that's all i do  well yeah i mean like  i know i know that i can save up enough money  to buy a tv  it's like 200 bucks  it's not even saving it's like a week  it's coming from sam  right  yeah  and i'm not a guy who spends money easily  but you gotta  i mean i'm not saying you should have a giant 90 inch television 
[03:39:00]  because god knows  all the televisions that i've ever owned in my life  added together wouldn't equal 90 inches  but  you gotta have something to watch tv on  i mean  yeah  it's one of these things where it's like  my parents are like these really strict eastern european types right  they're eastern european  from where  they're from uh  the former yugoslavia  okay  i've  i talked about this on the sunday show  by the way  big announcement  i'm doing a live show on sunday  from 4 p.m. to 6 p.m. 
[03:39:30]  you'll be able to tune in  because that's before the super bowl starts  and it looks like  i've talked to management  and it looks like i'll be able to do my show from radio row  so i will be in new orleans for the super bowl  and i'm really really pumped about it  yeah i don't know a lot about football  but there is apparently just the one game right  is that right  uh  i think so  so they're just doing the one game  right before that i'll be live from radio row  hopefully i'll get some guests and everything  and it'll be a good time  but that'll be sunday 4 p.m. eastern  and live on this channel 
[03:40:00]  apparently from radio row  so that's very exciting  but um  yeah what i was saying was  last week on the sunday show  i said  that i don't trust  eastern europeans  because  of two movies  taken  and hostile  and once you see those movies  it's like that is a lawless  area of the world  yeah  you know what i mean  it's just the people aren't to be trusted  were your parents ever  do they do any kidnappings  did your father ever kill anyone  for like a hobby 
[03:40:30]  uh  well  i mean the way he and my mom  started dating is he  is this  did he find her in one of these hostels  where he was gonna  and save her  because that's romantic  no she actually broke her leg  and he refused to treat her  until she went out with him  what  yeah  that's illegal  that's misery  uh  yeah that is  your mom kathy bates  stockholm syndrome  exactly  did your dad own a sledgehammer  no he was the only doctor  in some clinic  by uh  by a ski resort  and she was just  sitting there writhing in pain 
[03:41:00]  look i don't want  and she  and he wouldn't fix her  until she agreed to go out with him  yeah  i don't want to say anything  disparaging about your parents  because i've heard they're really  wonderful people  uh  but conceptually  that's not that far away from rape  just  just conceptually  as a concept  i'm sure in their situation  it was far more voluntary  but  conceptually  you understand what i'm saying  right  yeah  yeah okay  you won't be able to walk away  until you fuck me  right  and it's like  okay  well that is  yeah no  my dad started revealing 
[03:41:30]  a lot of  his  sexual behavior to me  in the last couple of months  well cause like  he thinks that i'm old enough  to actually  you know  be comfortable with him  telling me  like his  about his  i guess his deeds  when he was my age  but it just makes me feel  uncomfortable  evidently he had like  three girlfriends  at the exact same time  was he fucking all of them  yes  at the same time  he told me  he'd see them  every other night  so like  did he ever tuck it back  did he ever do that  did he put lipstick on  uh  i don't know 
[03:42:00]  you don't know for sure  cause you don't know  every detail  he's still revealing  things to me  that conversation  could happen in the future  it wouldn't be a huge  shock to you  if it was like  yeah i did have  a silk bathrobe  type of deal  like do you think  he ever had an  fbi agent  in a well in his house  do you think  like not  you don't know for sure  unless you do  but do you think  is it a possibility  it's a possibility  okay  i thought it might be a possibility  have you ever found  night vision goggles  no 
[03:42:30]  okay  well tell me if you do  cause if you do  that's a dead giveaway  dead giveaway  yes  okay  alright let's get  uh  you could  I guess you could  stay in here  and sal you could  stay in here  let's bring eric griffin  in here  I feel weird with him  sitting outside  yeah go tell him  he can come in  cause you know  and i want to talk to him  about the fact that  you're sitting there  this youth generation  you're supposed to be  watching workaholics  but you don't even have  televisions  hello everyone  eric  eric griffin  pleasure  welcome  come on in 
[03:43:00]  I'm here  sit down wherever  you're comfortable  this looks good right here  alright perfect  since we're gonna be  talking right  i want to like  get across from you  that's right  you can make eye contact  i like having you in here  because there aren't  very many people  that i can share  the studio with  that also have  we're live on the air  by the way  okay i don't know  if they tell you that  before you come in or not  but um  there aren't that many  people who have  questionable ethnicities  the way i do  people look at me  and you know  wait please  i'm way more questionable  than you  you think so  hell yeah 
[03:43:30]  i mean because i have  all the caucasian features  yes  except that fro  very black hair  yeah that fro is just  yeah  and so it confuses  a lot of people  no i would  you know  it's kind of jewy  it's a little  but i'm not jewish  right  but that's why people  right  that's why  with the complexion  in the hair  people don't know  yeah  people don't know  what i am either  you know  people want to know  what you are  so they can know  how to hate you  yeah  yeah  they want to know  what kind of racism  they can get away with  how can  what stereotypes  do i build upon  what can i say  they're just staring at you 
[03:44:00]  trying to figure out  your personality  they don't listen  to what you're saying  nothing at all  they're just like  is that drake's father  they're not sure  is he gonna rob me  or is  no i'm  is he gonna do my taxes  is he gonna  dynamite under that sweater  i'm not quite sure  what is your ethnicity  dynamite under the sweater  you see how racist  no i'm saying  they would say that  not me  they  these other people  like  like  you know  these crackers  and sal  the youth generation  are probably thinking  that  because they're  you know  they're phony racist 
[03:44:30]  they're taught  not to be racist  which makes them  even more racist  exactly  yeah  that's sort of like  carry down white guilt  right  exactly  you know  it's like  please tone it down  you don't have to  stick up for me  you know  they have your back  no matter what  can i tell you  i remember i was doing  a show in montana  and i was just  i was a feature  and the headliner  was this white guy  and we're in this  really crazy bar  you know  and this drunk guy  says you want to fight  you know  and i'm like no  why are you here  i'm trying to divert  and he's like  i moved from new york  i said why'd you 
[03:45:00]  move from new york  and he says  to get away from the  you know  and he says the n-word  you know  you can say that  we have dj who kid  from shade 45 on here  and he drops m-bombs  well i don't want to  feel free  but do it with the a  if you're gonna do it  well no  this guy didn't  so  so i just go  well you did a good job  you're here in montana  so good for you  and i walk away  i go tell this white headliner  and he flips out  he's like what  where is he  let's go talk  i'm like  why are you mad  what are you mad about  dude  i got this  i'm fine  i'm okay with it  this guy lives in montana  i'm passing through 
[03:45:30]  yeah  he can be racist  all he wants  he's out of my life  he's out of my life  and this guy was so mad  so it's just like  really crazy  this is why i don't like  watching movies  that are like based  like pre-1978  because racism  has to be a part of it  you understand  and if it's not a part of it  you're like  okay this is not  you know what i mean  so i don't even want to  i don't want to see people  overcoming stuff  and i think white people  are tired of being reminded  of how horrible they've been  well that's what i was saying  like that's what  like you're taught now  like especially in colleges  like how terrible it is 
[03:46:00]  to be racist  because here's what we did  here's how horrible  we treated everybody  from before we even got here  when we were over in europe  we were horrible  then we came here  so here's the list of words  you're never to say  and i always say  you know what  go ahead and say it  is the n-word  the 40 acres and a mule  you know  like did you guys  have a meeting  like okay here's  what we're gonna do  we're not gonna say  this word anymore  for you guys  no matter how many  n-bombs you drop  i'm still voting  so it's cool  like you're not getting that  yeah i totally agree with you 
[03:46:30]  so you know what's the  difference now  is that in society  people can be racist  or prejudiced  as long as they can't  affect your life  it doesn't really matter  it doesn't  you know if i walk  into a restaurant  and some white guy  is like you know  i don't care  you niggas  you know if they're like  you know  it doesn't matter  right  unless like  like unless some secret  tape of obama comes out  and you're like  yeah we're gonna help  the fucking spics  right  god damn it obama  what  that is all fool  you have such power  uh yeah  it'll be  the f word  is the new 
[03:47:00]  the new n-word  you know  yeah  yeah there's  but there's always  you have to  it's very hard  to keep up  with what's the new word  what's the new  yeah  cunt  well cunt's not even  that's universally  yeah the women just  you know  they get really upset  but men love it  yeah that's a great word  who's got that great joke  about there's like a big gap  between bitch and cunt  yeah it's huge  it's only two words we have  but like our intern alan  he didn't really think  that that was the word  he just wanted to say it  because it's just so fun  yeah it is a great word  to say 
[03:47:30]  but like  we're getting hate mail  right now though  the r word  retard  listen i have a whole thing  about this  where we gotta get  faggot and retard back  why is that  who's we  just all of us  heterosexual men  with full brains  yeah  we gotta get this back  because first of all  we don't even use  retard negatively  you go to a good party  what do you tell your friends  yo this party is retarded  it is retarded  nobody thinks they're  passing out helmets  right  right  nobody thinks there's  like good parking  outside  no this is just  it's like use common sense 
[03:48:00]  you know  and we gotta get  faggot back too  why do we need  faggot back  just to have it  just to have it  quick fast  faggot  pow  you just hit people with it  so what is your ethnicity  uh  i am uh  very mixed  yeah  my family's like  you know  caribbean  you know  so from like  honduras and belize  and jamaica  that's where my family's from  and my dad was like european  so i still  you know  it's whatever you need  yeah  it probably makes it easier  for you to not be offended  because if you decided  right right  to be offended  there's a book of stuff  that people wouldn't be able 
[03:48:30]  to say to you  so it's everything  i don't even  i just  yeah i really feel like  you know it's not like  i don't think we should  get rid of words  it's not about  what people say to us  that we need to get rid of  yeah  it's how we respond  that's the measure  of who you are  how do you mean  well it's like  if somebody's gonna come up to you  and they want to be hateful  they want to be prejudiced  because they're gonna be  some people are gonna be  it's okay  people have prejudice  against rich people  tall people  white people  black  whatever they have  their prejudice  there are a lot of people  who act like assholes  yeah people are just assholes  yeah  okay  so it's how you  interact with them on twitter  every day  how you respond to those assholes 
[03:49:00]  is who you are  it doesn't matter  what they're saying  that's the measure  of your character  you know  like i still have  a lot of family members  and friends  like you know  who are black  like traditionally black  and you know  they still think  that everything that  happens to them  is because they're black  and i'm like  no sometimes  you're an asshole  right  you know  that's all that is  you know so  have you seen the video  that's been going around  by the way  eric griffin  is gonna be  at carolines  all weekend  let's get that  business out of the way  i'm at carolines  come on out  let's talk about some stuff  yeah have you seen  the video 
[03:49:30]  that's been going around  to the security guard  in atlanta  no i have not seen that  oh it's great  there's this guy  there's this guy  he works at this mall  in uh  somewhere in atlanta  like right there  in downtown  where it's bad  and he's a black guy  and he keeps  having to chase  like drug dealers  and people  do you have the original one  with the girl  who gets tased  yeah  that's the one i want  eric griffin to see  was it a black girl  that got tased  of course it was  yeah  because  and it made me think  of like this is probably  a girl who would think  like you can't treat me 
[03:50:00]  but she obviously  deserves this treatment  like no one's ever  been to the post office  and wanted to tase  a black girl  exactly  put it on pause  for a second  because i want to  explain what's going on here  so this guy  he works at this mall  and all he does  is uh  try to scare criminals  and he chases  drug dealers out  and and he  it's a terrible mall  you can look around  when you see it  but he wears like  a gopro camera  on his vest  like you know  those little  yeah yeah yeah  and so  and he's got a taser  and a baton  and all these weapons  he's like the terminator 
[03:50:30]  of mall security cops  but  in this clip  what you missed  was like  the whole setup  was she was all  in his face  and she's pushing  her chest up  to his chest  and her little kids  are running around  going that's why  you gay  that's why you gay  and yelling at the  yelling at the security guard  and they're dropping  headbonds and everything  he'd had enough  and he's telling her  go home  get out of here  get out of the mall  this is my jurisdiction  I just want you  to see this girl  go down  get your kids  they're in the red shorts  get your children 
[03:51:00]  get your children  get your children  get your children  chime if you want  chime if you want  you better back it up  you better back it up  back it up  you better  you better back  watch her  she's about to get  look at her  first of all  I have no problem 
[03:51:30]  with what just happened  and I'm surprised  he took that many hits  did you see  I think I would have  tased her from jump  and then tased her kids  did you see her legs  just stiffen up  and going straight back  like a totem pole  and her kids by the way  this is the other thing  those little kids  a minute ago  they were all talk  little tough kids  they were all  that's why you gay  like I thought  that's a kid  who will fight somebody  and the minute  the mom starts  getting messed up  they're crying  and I love this 
[03:52:00]  now she's scared  get away from me  get away from me  you crazy  you crazy  and you notice how  everyone there  is just kind of like  well you were acting  like a little bitch  so  how come nobody's  attacking this guy  he's just like  no he's like  hey  you see her hitting me  he should tase this guy  next  does this guy  have to get tased  too  hold on  first of all  first of all  he's asking  why that security  has the nerve 
[03:52:30]  to do that  in front of his  babies right there  you didn't see  everything else  it's so crazy  first of all  this is the thing  though  that's like  a little weird  about this  is that  this was captured  and these people  just happen to be black  but there are  a lot of stupid  white people  in the country  too  maybe we're just  not capturing them  on camera  so I'm just  putting a call out  to everyone  right now  out there in America  when you see  white people  doing dumb stuff  they're on camera  but you know  the difference is  this only goes  on YouTube  when white people  do dumb stuff 
[03:53:00]  they make shows  about it  like Honey Boo Boo  that's what it is  they get reality deals  they get reality deals  black people get  world star hip hop  well not necessarily  because if you look  on like you know  VH1  they got some great  like Black Ink  have you ever seen  that show  no I've heard about it  it's great  it's like VH1  what VH1 does  is they get  black people  they pick a profession  and then they just  tape them acting crazy  yeah  you know that's what  they do on VH1  they have talent scouts  they're constantly  looking for the most  ignorant black people  they can find 
[03:53:30]  we'll just tape them  doing that  oh y'all own a deli  okay then they call it  black deli  and it's just people  you know people  acting crazy  but what I'm saying  is like  black deli  you should pitch that  see  it already sounds interesting  ooh is it gonna be meat  is it gonna be  black people in a deli  gonna see this  but that's what I'm saying  so I just think that  like don't be fooled by  like don't  don't make it a race issue  because like I say  there are stupid white people  doing stupid stuff  every single day  it's just  it's just 
[03:54:00]  you just search YouTube  you'll find it  but for some reason  when we see this kind of stuff  it becomes like a race issue  it's not a race issue  those were ignorant ass people  regardless of color  and doing ignorant ass stuff  and what happened  that lady got tased  in front of her kids  her kids now learned a lesson  okay  don't act up  in front of a security guard  and don't push him  don't hit him  don't curse at him  because you might get tased  right  speaking of ignorant people  watch  Eric  I just got a text  from DJ Who Kid  uh oh  I gave him the phone number 
[03:54:30]  okay  I'll look for it  do you know who DJ Who Kid is  we mentioned him a minute ago  yeah you did  the reason I brought him up  was he's  he's 50 cents DJ  he's G unit  you know  okay  so is he rich  yeah apparently  but he's like  he  he's very  he loves embracing  the ignorance  he comes on  and pulls piles of cash  out of his pocket  and says black people  don't have bank accounts  you know  so he's this guy  but he was doing  the show with me yesterday  because he does  he does this show  with me a lot  because he's hilarious 
[03:55:00]  and uh  then at like  6 or 7 o'clock  yesterday evening  pictures started  coming up online  of him in handcuffs  and being taken off  by police  what'd he do  I'm like  what the  this is  this comes up  oh no  was he acting ignorant  at some place  and I go  what the fuck happened  and so immediately  the hashtag  free who kid  starts  even though none of us  have any idea  what he did  we're sure he deserves  to be free  yeah let's make sure  he didn't like  you know  um  here actually  Sal  why don't you  give his number  to Aaron 
[03:55:30]  you have it  okay call him  um  I'm gonna text him  right now  and say we'll call you  because  I'm assuming  it was some kind  of driver's license  issue  oh really  but he's been  in lock up  overnight  wow  he texted me back  and said I just  got out  I just got out  oh that's gonna  so his street cred  is gonna be heavy  right now  I would hope so  he should start  rapping  yeah  no more this DJ  he just went from  DJ to rapper  find your own DJ  yeah  in two years  he'll get shot 
[03:56:00]  and then he'll  really be famous  yeah  did you hear about  Rick Ross getting shot  shot at  I should say  good grief  yeah  here's my thing  about 50 cent  you have a hundred  million dollars  you have a tailored  suit on  you're not a gangster  anymore  no  at some point  you graduate  from gangster  okay  and you now  you have two video games  yeah  it's 50 cent  for xbox  yeah  dude  come on  you have a driver  you know what I mean  you're almost white now  you know what I'm saying  stop  he has his own  porn production too  oh 
[03:56:30]  see  you own vitamin  the guy who owns  vitamin water  yeah  you're not a  G anymore  not a G  we're working on him  but the reason that you're in here  yeah why are you in here  is because  you're on workaholics  I'm on workaholics  how did you get hooked up  with the workaholics guys  I just  no I just went on an audition  I just auditioned for the part  and I got it  that's awesome  it was real simple  because you know  we're talking about TV shows  there's this whole thing now  with young people  where they feel like  oh we don't need a TV  this guy's in college  he doesn't have a television  I totally understand it  yeah but this is your business 
[03:57:00]  no no no  but check this out  no no  you're just talking about  the method in which  they receive their entertainment  he's not saying  he doesn't watch entertainment  he's saying he just doesn't  watch it on TV  yeah like Netflix  yeah  and I totally understand this  I really do  because if  let me tell you  once we can start getting sports  streaming on like my Xbox  or Playstation  or something like that  I'm done with cable  I guess so  you know  who kid's on the line  who kid  Black History Month
