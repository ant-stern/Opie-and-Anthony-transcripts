<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony show opened with the hosts and Jim Norton engaging in their usual vulgar banter, criticizing the show's intro music and outlining their cynical strategy for achieving higher ratings – essentially, dumbing down the content.  This was followed by a discussion centered around the presence of two homeless men, Tippi Tom and Grey Wolf, in the studio.  Detailed, graphic descriptions of Tippi Tom's poor hygiene, including scratching, nose-picking, public urination, and his HIV-positive status and homosexuality were shared.  Grey Wolf, despite recent improvements, was noted to have spent time with Tippi Tom that morning.  Past interactions with Tippi Tom, including a "homeless shopping spree" segment and the mention of another deceased homeless regular, Ziggy, were recounted.  The hosts' contrasting clothing styles were also highlighted, with Anthony's increasing sophistication contrasting Opie's sloppiness. A caller suggested a travel fund for the hosts.  Opie's accidentally wearing a smelly sweater fueled a further discussion about personal hygiene and clothing choices.  The show then played insensitive audio clips from an HBO documentary about little people, prompting more crude commentary from the hosts.  Tippi Tom and Grey Wolf were then brought in for a musical performance characterized by their lack of skill, Tippi Tom's odor, and more offensive jokes from the hosts.  A listener call interrupted this, before the hosts prepared for the arrival of porn star Mary Carey.

A phone interview with actress Amanda Peet promoting *A Lot Like Love* followed, preceded by a mention of the smelly homeless men's musical performance. The interview covered Peet's work with Ashton Kutcher, his relationship, and her experiences with nudity, interspersed with sexually suggestive comments and jokes from the hosts and Jimmy, a staff member who revealed a recent illness.  This was succeeded by a series of vulgar and offensive rants targeting interns, listeners, and smokers, laden with homophobic and misogynistic slurs.  A large portion focused on the hosts' frustrating experience recording a 10-second commercial for XM Satellite Radio, featuring multiple failed attempts and recordings showcasing their growing frustration and exhaustion, particularly from Anthony.  Various news items, including teacher sex scandals and a lottery winner's refusal to share winnings, were discussed. Bill Burr was mentioned as an upcoming guest, and Tippi Tom and Grey Wolf were announced to deliver the news.  Recordings of Orson Welles struggling with a commercial recording were played, followed by the hosts reiterating their exhaustion.

Comedian Bill Burr appeared as a guest, but the focus remained on Tippi Tom, with extensive discussion of his hygiene, behavior (including near-death sleep experiences), and the hosts' interactions with him. A contentious phone call with Bruce Kelly, a producer, ensued, marked by insults and heated exchanges over production issues and perceived lack of support.  Tippi Tom and Grey Wolf then delivered a highly unconventional news segment, interspersed with jokes and improvisational moments.  Tom repeatedly was offered money to remove his clothing, resulting in partial nudity. Listener calls followed, reacting to both the news segment and Bruce Kelly's earlier comments.  The segment concluded with further musical interludes and attempts to get Tippi Tom to sing, while Gray Wolf played the flute.  Mary Carey, a porn star arrested for self-touching in a strip club, was again mentioned as an upcoming guest.


The show continued with the hosts recounting a listener’s poor hygiene and spitting.  This transitioned into an offensive song about SARS, targeting Chinese people. A caller, "Dragon Wagon," challenged the show's content, leading to a highly confrontational exchange filled with offensive insults.  The upcoming appearance of porn stars Mary Carey and Tawny Roberts was then discussed. Chris Jericho made a brief call before Mary Carey and Tawny Roberts arrived, visibly intoxicated.  Their conversation focused on Carey's recent arrest in Lakewood, Washington, for violating strip club rules. This devolved into a sexually explicit conversation, including numerous offensive remarks and crude humor about the penis sizes of various NBA players. Roberts' intoxication was a recurring topic.  The conversation frequently veered off-topic, including discussions about the hosts’ and guests’ physical appearances and sexual acts.  Tawny Roberts temporarily left, upset by the hosts’ comments, before returning. A prank call followed, involving a nanny and her mother reacting to a fake confession about pornography. The segment concluded with further jokes about the guests’ appearances and sexual behavior, including offers to touch Mary Carey’s breasts. Bill Burr was present throughout much of this segment.

The final excerpt focused on Mary Carey and Tawny Roberts, with a highly sexually explicit and vulgar conversation centered on their sexual experiences, including details about encounters with celebrities (an unnamed NBA player and Tom Green), and preferences regarding penis size.  Several offensive and inappropriate listener calls, including one with misogynistic insults directed at the guests, caused Mary Carey to temporarily leave the studio.  The hosts and guests reacted with varying degrees of engagement and escalation of the vulgarity.  The guests' alcohol consumption was a significant topic, with jokes about their intoxication.  Tawny Roberts disclosed personal information about her family background, including her parents' mental health. The segment ended with the guests promoting their websites and upcoming appearances, maintaining a raucous and highly unprofessional tone.

[00:02:30]  Thank you. 
[00:03:00]  I love paying for sex.  This moral decay weakens our resistance to the onslaught of the communist masters of 
[00:03:30]  disease.  We're a bunch of scumbags.  These abnormalities are corrupting the minds and the hearts of our children.  Jackass.  I can't believe it.  Pedophile humor.  It's depressing and horrendous.  It's awful.  A bunch of idiots.  Perversion.  Here it goes.  Here it goes.  The Opie and Anthony program.  The Opie and Anthony.  God, that irritates me.  It's just like somebody took a bath to my brain. 
[00:04:00]  We're the only radio show that makes you want to hate us.  Opie.  I want my coffee.  Anthony.  I want that back.  Jim Norton.  I want Ozzy.  We are going to dumb this thing down to the point that we're going to be number one with  Down syndrome children.  No, do it.  It's terrible.  The Opie and Anthony show.  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road. 
[00:04:30]  I see the awful, terrible things in my life and turn it into something funny.  God damn it.  Are you fucking with me?  Hello, exactly.  Okay, terrific.  You just mind your fees and cues, buster, and remember who you're dealing with.  Nothing works here.  Uh-huh.  The medications don't work.  What medications have you?  I hate this place. 
[00:05:00]  Call me sir.  God damn it.  Asshole.  Pardon my French, but you're an asshole.  I don't care.  I don't care.  I honestly don't care.  Have you ever been in a Turkish prison?  We have clearance, Clarence.  Roger, roger.  What's our vector, Victor?  Ma, please stop pulling me.  Is that so?  Who made you pulp in this dump, huh? 
[00:05:30]  Welcome to the Opie and Anthony program.  Greetings.  Uh-oh.  Yeah?  Uh-oh.  Problem?  Uh-oh.  I'm not sure yet.  Okay.  Problem?  No, we're good, right?  You're all, uh-  I don't know if someone messes with the knobs every day.  The nab.  I don't know why people are messing with the knobs every day.  The nab. 
[00:06:00]  No one else is supposed to use the studio, right?  That's what the rumor is.  Mark the knobs and just make sure they're there in the same place.  Same position.  Position as yesterday.  All right.  It's the only virus spreading across America thanks to XM Satellite Radio kicking the little  doggies' ass every single day.  Arf.  Arf.  Wow.  Lively day here at the studio.  Yeah, there's a lot of people around.  Oh, my God. 
[00:06:30]  Oh, God.  Look at them.  That's not a good sign.  That's not a good sign, Jimmy.  Look at that.  Oh, God.  Oh, my God.  What is falling off of that head?  Oh, man.  That is a bad sign.  Do you know we're going to have to disinfect that chair and that whole area?  I don't know what kind of lice just fell all over that chair.  Oh, he has lice.  I don't want to get little lice on me.  No.  I don't either.  Oh, my God.  Is that funny?  Now we've got to tell everyone what's going on.  We have so much to do today.  Wow. 
[00:07:00]  Oh, he's digging behind his ears.  Tippi Tom's in the studio today.  You might remember Tippi Tom.  Yeah.  We had him on a few months back.  Well, you know what?  You know what, Anthony?  We've got a lot of new listeners out there.  Tippi Tom.  You've got to explain Tippi Tom to everybody.  Tippi Tom is one of the famous homeless people in New York City.  We've made him famous.  He's a homeless guy.  And our buddy Keith the Cop found him for a little thing we did years ago. 
[00:07:30]  It was a Christmas promotion we did.  He's now picking his nose, dude.  It was a homeless shopping spree, it was called.  And we got a bunch of homeless people, put them on a bus, and took them to the...  Which mall was it?  Short Hills was the first time we did it, which was a really hoity-toity type of place.  It was a prestigious hoity-toity mall, and we unleashed the homeless inside this mall and  gave them some money and had them shop. 
[00:08:00]  Oh, yeah.  And try on clothes and to the horror of the stores in this mall.  Well, Tippi Tom was really a standout amongst the homeless as a true lunatic.  Him and Ziggy.  Oh, Ziggy's dead.  Yeah, Ziggy's dead.  Yeah, Ziggy died.  Ziggy's dead.  He dead?  How did it happen?  You're kidding.  Where?  Where?  Oh, no.  I was just watching him urinate on himself. 
[00:08:30]  Where?  I'll give my condolences to his head lice.  I've got a really bad headache to start the morning.  Don't make me laugh too hard.  So we had the homeless shopping spree, and he really stood out to me, Tom.  Oh, yeah.  So we had him come back a couple of times.  He just proves every time he's back that he's a complete lunatic.  He's showing Master Poe his muscles for some reason.  I've got muscles!  Yeah.  He's showing everyone his muscles. 
[00:09:00]  But he was sitting in the chair, and we could look outside the studio through this big window  we have.  And he took his...  I guess he had a wool cap on?  Yeah.  He took it off and was digging his fingernails into his scalp and scratching.  I've never seen anyone itch their scalp like he just itched his scalp.  It was crazy how much he was itching his scalp.  I thought it was snowing in here.  And then he took his fingers and started scratching behind his ears and in his ears, and then he's  like reaming his nose out. 
[00:09:30]  Unbelievable.  Unbelievable.  He is a wreck, man.  So we're going to get him in in a few seconds here, or a few minutes or whatever.  I'm not bringing him in until I'm done eating.  All right.  And then Grey Wolf's out there, too?  Yeah, Grey Wolf is actually almost like a success story.  He's cleaned himself up a little bit, but for some reason he was hanging out with Tippi  Tom this morning.  That's not a good thing.  No.  And, oh, you know, we failed to mention to the new listeners.  Sorry, Keith.  Hold on one second.  Tippi Tom has AIDS, and he's a gay gentleman as well.  Yeah. 
[00:10:00]  Homeless gay AIDS.  Oh, he's scratching again.  And he's scratching his head.  Look at him scratching.  Oh, my God.  Both hands.  Both hands.  He's digging in his head.  Dude, look at him scratch.  And now he's brushing off his shirt.  He's kicking his nose.  He brushes off his shirt.  God knows.  Look, now he's fixing his hair.  Well, I found him this morning downstairs in the subway, and he had his shirt off.  He was laying on the floor, and his underwear today are horrific, like it was hanging out 
[00:10:30]  the back of his pants.  And I woke him up, and I says, come on, let's go.  We'll go up to the radio.  He goes, I got to take a leak.  And I says, well, you can take a leak when you get there.  He goes, no, I'm not going to make it.  So now it's 630 in the morning, and everyone's going to work, and he rips his pants down on  the steps of the subway, and just pulls his cock out, and starts taking a leak all over  the steps.  So I had to walk away, and then he finishes, and the look of horror on everyone's face, 
[00:11:00]  and then he walks up.  He goes, all right, I'm ready.  Let's go.  Yeah.  Yeah, he's ready.  All right, no problem.  Well, the last time he was here, he fell asleep, and I'm not, this isn't a radio thing.  We all thought he was dead.  Yeah.  Because we could not wake him.  And then Master Poe did some weird thing with water to wake him up.  Yeah, he dropped water in his ear.  Water in his ear.  How is he still alive?  Like, how does somebody like that survive?  He's got diseases.  He's got no way of supporting himself.  How does he eat?  How do those bugs not eat a hole through his brain? 
[00:11:30]  I'm amazed by the homeless.  I don't know.  And then we got Gray Wolf.  Yes, Keith.  Gray Wolf is out there, too.  Gray Wolf was also part of the homeless shopping spree.  Gray Wolf, he's one of the musical homeless people that we had on.  He had brought in this wooden flute.  He plays a mean flute.  Plays a wooden flute.  Sure.  And I see him out there.  He's got a guitar now.  But apparently he's cleaned himself up.  And is he still homeless?  I think he's kind of like, you know, sometimes homeless.  He looks well fed. 
[00:12:00]  He just goes out and hangs out for the beers, I think.  Yeah.  Hangs out with the homeless guys for the beer.  But he says he's put out a CD or something with some people.  I don't know.  And he just handed his guitar over to Tippy Tom.  And Tippy Tom is now trying to tune it up.  Is that him playing?  Look at those fingers on those fretboard.  It looks like he knows what he's doing.  All right.  We're going to have to get them in in a few seconds.  Tippy Tom's going to have to play a few riffs.  A few minutes, a few seconds.  Basically, as soon as Anthony's done eating.  I don't feel bad now.  We walked into the office to get ready for the show today. 
[00:12:30]  And I looked over at Anthony, and he's dressed very, very nice.  Thank you, Opin.  Not that I care.  Trust me.  But, you know, Anthony and I have been doing this for about 10 years now.  A little more than 10 years.  And I don't know.  You have now surpassed me in clothing.  What?  And I never thought that was possible.  I never thought that was possible.  I was the T-shirt, the logo T-shirt and jeans guy.  With rotting sneakers, basically, when I first met you. 
[00:13:00]  Was it?  Oh, dude, your shoes were horrendous.  Were they?  Yeah, you had really bad sneakers, awful jeans, concert T-shirts or T-shirts with booze logos on it.  Booze logos or video game logos.  Video game logos?  Yeah, I had a lot of video game logos.  Descent.  Oh, okay.  Things like that.  So, our agent's in town.  So, I guess we're going out to lunch after the show to get absolutely nothing accomplished.  Woo-hoo!  Party.  I think Bob has this feeling that we just want to hang out with him. 
[00:13:30]  Party with Bob Eatman.  Because he's so exciting.  You know it's going to be fun, dude.  I can't wait for all the great stories he's going to have for us.  You know when we finally settle down at a table at some restaurant, sit down, look at Bob across from us.  You just know a party's happening.  Yeah.  It's going to be fun and exciting.  So, you got your lunch clothes on.  You figured you'd dress up a little bit.  A little bit.  A little bit more than usual.  Really?  I think it's just brighter colors.  Brand new jeans.  Brand new shoes.  I've got a lot of new clothes, but you're happening. 
[00:14:00]  So, I too thought I'd dress a little bit nicer than usual for Bob.  So, I got this sweater on, and I go rollerblading to work like I do every morning.  Yeah.  And every morning I have to deal with Poe going, how do you do that?  Just shut up.  Let me in the building.  He's amazed by my rollerblading skills.  Yeah.  Well, as I rollerblade about five miles an hour down a sidewalk, he's amazed by that for some reason.  I'm like, dude, after the show you should follow me if you really want to be amazed.  In and out of traffic. 
[00:14:30]  Every once in a while holding on to a delivery truck for a little bit just to get a little speed going.  Do you have one of those, a will written out or something where do not resuscitate or pull the feeding tube or something because it's bound to happen?  It's every once in a while, and I make sure the conditions are just right.  How does that sound?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  I'm not going to make it sound like I'm going from truck to truck all the way home.  But, you know, sometimes you nod to the driver of the truck, hint that you want a little hitch, and he'll slow down slightly and let you grab a hold for a little bit. 
[00:15:00]  That's all.  You know, that's all.  All right.  So, actually, going back to the old days, remember Ken Stevens?  Who can forget Ken?  When we were, you know, renegotiating our contract, I used to talk about, you know, this rollerblading in and out of traffic on the streets of Manhattan,  and he kind of wanted one of those stupid stipulations in the contract that I would only rollerblade in parks and stuff and not on the streets of Manhattan. 
[00:15:30]  Protecting their investment.  So, you know, it's early when we get up and shower and whatever, so I throw this sweater on thinking, okay, you know, this will be just fine for Bob.  I come in, and you're obviously more better dressed than me, which isn't a problem, trust me.  So then we're sitting in the office, and I have the same jeans on, by the way.  I wear the same jeans all week.  Jesus, dude.  Don't you do laundry?  Yeah, but, you know, dude, I mean, wear the jeans for four hours and then whatever. 
[00:16:00]  I mean, you know, I got fresh underwear and stuff.  That's the key.  That's the key.  You could go through.  You could wear jeans a lot longer than you think.  You know what the problem is?  It's not so much that you're wearing the jeans and things are coming off your body and soaking into them in four hours.  You're constantly with your hands, you know, kind of wiping on your pants.  I'm not talking about wiping gobs of anything on there, but, you know, you're constantly doing that.  If you've got something on your hands, maybe.  Relax, Howard Hughes.  Jesus. 
[00:16:30]  You might wipe them on your pants.  And what's going to happen?  On your pants.  Then it's on your pants.  That's where they get dirty from.  So you've got to get new pants every day.  Tippy Tom's been wearing the same pants all week.  You've got to wear new pants every day.  You wear brand new pants.  Well, you wear fresh pants, clean pants every day.  No way.  Every day.  Same jeans for the whole week, Monday through Friday.  For the most part.  For the most part.  Different jeans.  Different pants every day.  Some days, yeah, they get a little skanky or you get caught in the rain or something stupid. 
[00:17:00]  And then you throw them in the laundry bin.  You know what else I enjoy?  But, dude, we're not seeing anyone.  That's the other thing.  I know I don't smell.  I know they look all right.  So I just throw them.  Well, not normally.  Yeah.  Well, that's what I'm going to get to.  So, but I enjoy also, quickly, I don't wear white, I don't wear the white tube socks anymore.  I've grown accustomed to dress socks.  Oh, my God.  I like the feel of them.  See, I like the, not like the thin ones that you wear with like dress shoes or something like that. 
[00:17:30]  They have to have some bulk to them.  But, um, they're, you know, dress socks.  I kind of like that.  Everyone in the studio right now is shaking their heads.  You at home, you're like, well, this sounds very normal.  Of course it does.  But you don't understand where Anthony began.  You have no idea.  He probably had four or five pairs of tube, something's going on out there.  Four or five pairs of tube socks.  And you probably had holes in them and all that crap.  Now you've got brand new, like.  I'm making it up for lost time.  It's amazing. 
[00:18:00]  So, I.  And are you getting your nails done?  I really.  No, no.  I don't get my nails done at all.  I just make sure they're nicely clipped after I shower.  You do it after you shower and then your nails are a little softer and they don't crack.  Ben.  When you clip them.  Sorry.  Yes, Ben.  I'm sorry to interrupt, but Tom's looking forward to his stage time.  He wants to get on the stage again.  On the stage.  He's up.  Oh, God.  All right, we'll get him in here.  He got out of his seat and started wandering around and he had to run out there and go,  Tom, Tom, back in the seat.  Scratching his head all over the place. 
[00:18:30]  Oh, no.  Let me go to Max in Dallas.  He's a faithful listener of the program.  I recognize Max.  Max, what's up?  Hey, what's going on, boys?  How are you, buddy?  All right.  Damn, your phone's down great.  Oh, good.  Good, good.  All right.  Anyhow, I'm sorry, Ed.  I'm going to have to take Opie's side about the jeans, wearing the jeans a week.  I mean.  Yeah.  You guys are starting to sound more and more like the fucking odd couple.  Yeah, I am.  I don't know.  You know, I got a maid now because I am a slob and I...  You don't even know that she comes at this point. 
[00:19:00]  My place is just gathering more and more stuff all the time.  Like junk or garbage?  Not garbage.  No, I'm clean, but I just can't...  I can't...  Like, I have a dresser, but my clothes are still all over the floor.  Wait, wait.  You got that dresser.  I remember we talked about that.  Yeah.  You finally had it delivered.  It's a nice dresser.  You finally have a place to put your clothes, yet you still have them in piles on the floor.  Yeah, I put most of the clothes in the dresser to begin with, but now they're starting  to end up on the floor again.  Oh, my goodness.  Hey, Opie, I got a question for you. 
[00:19:30]  Yeah.  I remember a few months, about a month or so ago, you guys were talking about broadcasting  from a remote area.  Yeah.  I know you guys are kind of getting messed around on, you know, your travel junk whenever  you guys go somewhere.  Right.  I had an idea that maybe people could start plunking in an Opie and Anthony travel fund  and then...  Oh, a travel fund?  Yeah, pay Kenny that, and then you guys don't even have to deal with that, Tim, as far as that's  concerned.  Oh, no.  You know that bitchin' and complainin' we did yesterday? 
[00:20:00]  Did it work?  Oh, yeah, it worked.  Oh, yeah, because they know how important it is for us to be on the road.  Oh, yeah, it worked.  Well, we want you down here in Dallas.  Problem solved, my friend.  Problem solved.  They broke me, though, yesterday.  What?  They did.  We want you down here in Dallas for the good legs and eggs.  All right, Max, thanks.  Later.  Let's just finish this really fast.  Yeah.  So, I threw on the sweater and the jeans I've had on since Monday, and I'm in the office  looking at how nicely dressed Anthony is, and I'm going, well, all right, I might look 
[00:20:30]  all right, too, I guess, you know?  And all of a sudden, I'm sitting there reading the New York Post and the Daily News getting  ready for the show, and also, I'm like...  I glanced over and saw you stick your nose down the front of your shirt.  Oh, okay.  All of a sudden, I'm like, what the hell?  And then I'm thinking one of the interns doesn't shower, you know?  We had that problem with Eric, you know, months ago.  That's fine now.  Relax, Eric.  What happened?  What happened?  It's fine, man.  What did I go all come on for?  It's been totally fine since. 
[00:21:00]  So, I'm thinking one of the interns, you know, might not have showered or something.  Notice you blame the interns, you know?  Of course.  So, I'm sniffing around, like, what they're there for?  I'm like, someone reeks a little bit here, man.  It's not Anthony, obviously, you know?  And I'm like, what the hell?  Ben?  And then finally, I sniff myself.  I'm like, oh, God.  Oh, no.  And now, I'm like, you know, I'm not happy.  Are you pitting out?  No.  You know what happened?  I wore the same sweater, I guess, a couple days ago. 
[00:21:30]  And, you know, it just...  You know, when it was 85 here in Manhattan.  Well, here's the problem.  And, you know, it just came out of the water.  It just came out of the laundry.  So, technically, I should be able to get a couple wears out of the sweater, okay?  Because it's one of the sweaters you got to dry clean, I guess.  But I rollerblade home, and it was like 80, 85 degrees.  Oh, wow.  And it was such a nice afternoon when we got out of here.  I decided to kind of do a half a loop of the park on top of it.  And I got home sweaty, and I just took the sweater off real fast, not thinking, and just kind of threw it on my dresser. 
[00:22:00]  Uh-huh.  And then I just picked it up and threw it on today.  And so now I got to reek all day.  Ugh.  Yeah.  But it turned out I was reeking, and I never reek.  Why wouldn't you just, knowing that you were hot when you were rollerblading and sweating, why wouldn't you take the sweater off and put it in the laundry?  It was just, I got home, and I just, you know, took it off, threw a T-shirt on, whatever, and forgot about it.  Just threw it to the side, not thinking twice about it.  You know?  It didn't feel all sweaty when I took it off.  You know what I mean? 
[00:22:30]  I just, I just never wear the same thing twice anymore.  I used to.  Yeah.  I got to tell you.  Not anymore.  You don't wear anything twice?  Nothing.  Nothing twice.  I'm done here.  It goes right in the laundry.  And I put on my hanging out around the house stuff.  Jesus!  Who, you, Sinatra?  You need to do socks every day out of the package?  What's the matter with you?  I put my ascot on.  I walk around the house. 
[00:23:00]  I hope the listeners are with me on this.  I know the old listeners are with me.  You guys have no idea.  I have, like, lounging pants?  When I, quote, found Anthony, he was installing air conditioners.  Yes, I was.  Didn't have money for clothes, so, you know, his clothes were in bad, bad shape.  And now you don't wear anything?  The only clothes I ever had when I was working for a living were clothes that I got for Christmas  and my birthday from relatives.  That was pretty much it.  That's all.  I never went out and bought clothes. 
[00:23:30]  Also, my wife at the time worked at a bar.  Right.  So all the booze that would come in, usually the booze delivery guys show up with stacks  of T-shirts and stuff.  So I would grab a bunch of those.  And that was my wardrobe.  It was jeans from my family giving me presents and T-shirts from the bar.  And that was pretty much it.  The white socks and the package of Fruit of the Looms that you'd get for Christmas also.  And that was what I owned. 
[00:24:00]  One pair of sneakers.  Pretty much it.  And that's what I did.  And, yeah, I wore the clothes a lot before.  And the clothes were strewn all over my room.  And then one day, like maybe a month, a month and a half later, I'd shove them all in two  huge mail bags and go to the laundromat, dump them in, not separate anything, of course.  Yeah, yeah.  And just dump them in the washer, wash them, and then it's good for another month.  And when my floor got completely covered with clothes, it was time to...  Yeah, well, my floor is completely covered with clothes right now as I speak. 
[00:24:30]  You never do the sniff test or any of that stuff?  No reason to.  The clothes are washed.  Where, like, there's a bunch of jeans on the floor and you realize you don't have any  fresh stuff, so now you're sniffing around to see which one smells the best?  My closet's full of fresh stuff.  I don't wear the same thing twice.  It comes off.  I get into my lounging around the house pants.  You know what?  And perhaps I'll throw on a T-shirt that is, you know, we got a lot of NYPD T-shirts and  stuff like that, so I'll throw one of those on.  And that's my lounging around the house. 
[00:25:00]  I'll walk out on the back deck, look around, put my hands on my hips and look at the squirrels.  Yeah, I'm here.  Yeah, I made it.  And people want to know if you're wearing the clothes from Rodeo Drive.  No, no, those are special occasion clothes.  The ones I bought on Rodeo.  Maybe a night at the theater or perhaps a night out.  Give us an update on the Rodeo Drive clothes.  Have you worn them at all?  No, no, that's special occasion stuff.  That's the problem, you'll never wear them. 
[00:25:30]  No, no.  You don't do special occasion stuff.  I'll go out, me and the girl will go out, we'll go out to dinner somewhere nice and I'll  put the clothes on.  Sure.  And now I got more shoes than I ever had in my life too.  For some reason you need different shoes with different clothes.  Right.  So I got like nice dress shoes.  I used to have sneakers and dress shoes and that was it.  But there are different degrees of dress shoes that you need and different degrees of your  casual shoes.  Yeah.  I'm still not at that point, by the way.  You're not?  No.  Like sometimes you can have something that's moderately dressy and you need a nice shoe for that 
[00:26:00]  that isn't a sneaker, but it isn't like your black dress shoes that you would wear with  a suit.  So you got to step down a little.  Some kind of nice brown leather shoe that I bought up in Boston last time we were there.  And very nice.  Oi.  Jim from Ohio.  What's up, Jim?  Oi.  Hey, man.  Oi.  Oi, oi, oi.  And I'm not Jewish.  Jim, go ahead.  Truck drivers don't even wear their clothes that many days in a row, man.  Really?  Yeah.  Pants three days at the most. 
[00:26:30]  Shirt maybe two days, man.  No truck drivers.  We don't have to.  Please, the hemorrhoids will soak right through.  We don't have to impress anyone around here, though.  We get here around, you know, 530, 545.  There's no real bosses around.  No chicks around.  It's all guys.  It's like we do the show and then go home.  We don't see anyone.  Yeah.  And as long as you're not smelling, who cares?  Dude, I did a smell check, I swear, on a pair of boxers.  I could all wear my boxers three, four days.  Honest to God, I could care less.  You'll wear your boxer shorts. 
[00:27:00]  Could care less.  Three days?  Four days.  Four days.  Unless I'm seeing a girl, then I won't.  But if I'm not seeing a girl, I could care less.  I did the sniff check on the front because I whizzed so much, it smelled like whizz, the  front of my box.  They're not wet.  But it's like when you whizz and you're shaking, that drop gets in there.  Of course.  Because I pee constantly.  Drop that up.  In front of it smelled like whizz.  I'm 36.  Oh, wow.  That's awesome.  All right, well, there you have it.  We should, you want to get Tippi Tom in?  Well, why don't we take a quick break?  Is he going to come in? 
[00:27:30]  I'll finish my sandwich.  Huh?  Can you stand over there?  Hey, can't we take the cord through the door?  No.  You guys, stop.  Stop.  Stop.  Stop.  You guys are becoming divas.  We can handle the...  Divas?  We can handle the homeless gay guy with AIDS for a few months in the studio.  I don't care about the AIDS.  I don't want the lice on me if he's itching.  I know.  Well, just stay away from him.  All right?  Put some nit in his head.  Nah, we don't need Tippi Tom singing.  He's going to give us all new stuff today.  So we'll just go to break and continue with the O&A show in just a bit. 
[00:28:00]  Like sands through the hourglass, so is the O&A virus.  Hey, here's the first clip from the HBO dwarf special.  Oh, we got it.  They kind of highlighted a few midgets on the show and followed them through their daily activities.  Some are doing very well, like the doctor.  Others, not so good.  This is why I go the other way and laugh openly at stuff.  Yeah.  Because you know damn well HBO's doing this dwarf special, okay?  And they're talking to this old midget, which is sad to begin with. 
[00:28:30]  Yep.  You just think about his life and how tough it was and blah, blah, blah.  Yeah, he was a real old midget, born in 41.  And you know how tolerant people are in the 40s of stuff like that.  Get it away.  Don't let it touch me.  Yeah, keep it away.  Better known as the good old days.  Ah, the good old days.  His parents abandoned him and sent him to this school for kids like him.  And he grew up and became some laborer at some bed and breakfast. 
[00:29:00]  And then what they do is actually bring him to his mom to introduce him to his mother again after all these years.  His mother's still alive.  Do they?  Oh, boy.  Yeah.  Is that what's coming up on...  I don't remember that one.  I don't know.  I don't know if they had that.  I'm just commenting.  It was pretty gruesome.  Oof.  It was called the good old days because back then you were allowed to react like a human being.  Nowadays, everyone is, you know, so politically correct.  And they try to tell you that you're not supposed to react when you see, like, you know, somebody that doesn't look like you.  You don't remember that part where he went to, like, meet up with... 
[00:29:30]  No, he described a meeting with his mother where he had gone years later and she rejected him and told him to go away.  But he didn't...  Didn't they show the apartment and everything?  Yes, but they don't show the mother.  The mother might be...  I think the mother's dead.  They do show the...  Oh, maybe I got confused because I saw the apartment.  They showed, like, the apartment.  Yeah, and he's going...  And I went to visit my mother.  You know, this awful voice and he just sounds dumb.  At least the midget doctor is a doctor.  This guy just sounds like a dope.  Back in 74, I found out where my mother lived in New York. 
[00:30:00]  She lived in a very rich apartment.  The apartment was rich.  And when I went to see her, I went up to third floor to see her. 
[00:30:30]  And when I rang the doorbell, and when she saw...  How did he ring the doorbell?  Oh, oh.  How did he ring the doorbell?  The stick.  He asked the black guy holding the pizza to ring it for him.  Can you just ring this, please?  You know, when she saw me there, she was totally a shot. 
[00:31:00]  She says to me,  Rob, what are you doing here?  You're not supposed to be leaving Connecticut.  You can't come here.  I can't take care of you.  I don't think I was in her apartment.  I don't think I was in her apartment.  But ever since then, I have no use for the parents whatsoever. 
[00:31:30]  To me, they were not.  When they died a few years ago, I had no feelings whatsoever.  Sorry to say that, but that's the way it is.  He's acting like he's striking back.  They didn't care about you either, stupid.  Yeah, exactly.  Maybe if you weren't such a bad boy.  Such a bad, short boy.  He went in 74.  Boy, that means he was 33. 
[00:32:00]  Yeah.  And his mother's like, I can't take care of you.  You're not supposed to leave Connecticut.  Yes.  Where was that law?  There was a law back then.  Right.  All midgets are to stay in Connecticut.  You know that she told him that when she left.  Like, I don't want to have to leave you, but you can't leave Connecticut, and I have to.  New law just being passed.  All midgets are to stay in Connecticut.  Connecticut, the land of the dwarf.  Remember, if you're a genetic disaster, and you give birth to one of these freaks with cocktail 
[00:32:30]  pranks for fingers, bring him to Connecticut.  You'll get a free carton of Lucky Strike cigarettes.  Now, what would you rather have, the refreshing taste of a lucky, or some disaster screwing up your family photo?  Of course, you'll take the lucky, so drop off your mess in Connecticut, and tell them they are not to leave under any circumstances. 
[00:33:00]  Opie and Anthony, the virus is spreading.  Opie and Anthony, XM 202.  They call me cowboy, I'm a singer in black, so throw a finger in the air, let me see where you're at, say.  Hey, hey.  Let me hear where you're at, say.  Hey, hey.  I'm giving it back, so say.  Hey, hey.  Show me some medicine, say.  Hey, hey, hey, hey.  Yeah.  All right, we're getting ready to get Tippi Tom in here. 
[00:33:30]  What was going on outside the studio, Anthony?  Well, apparently, Poe was filling out paperwork for Tippi Tom, and he just asked him, where do you reside?  So I just heard Tom yelling things like, subway, doorway, apartment building, just blurting out areas around the city.  That's why I heard, I heard, the subway. 
[00:34:00]  Oh, Tippi's got to go out there now, because something's going on.  Tippi's up again.  He's not sitting.  That seat, I can't get out of here.  I don't know, I'm going to have to make a Lysol cloud around me.  Dude, you're well protected.  You're fine.  You're the furthest away from Tippi Tom.  Let's get Tippi Tom in here, Eric.  Would you scrape your teeth against his scalp?  Oh, Jesus.  Would you probably put your nose over his ear and smell?  All right.  Ladies and gentlemen, one of my faves, he's entering the studio. 
[00:34:30]  Now, have him use a remote mic.  Tippi Tom.  I thought we had a handheld.  You got to get on the radio?  Yeah, come on, Tippi.  Oh, my God.  Step up to that microphone.  Hey.  Hey.  Hey, Tom.  It's Tippi Tom's show.  How you doing, Tom?  Hanging in there, man.  Yeah?  And what I'm saying is that thank you all for being so nice to me.  Tom, don't talk anything.  I want to sing you a song.  Oh.  But my lead guitar player won't cooperate with me, and so I'm having a little hard time right 
[00:35:00]  now.  But I want to get busy.  Don't want out, man.  All right.  Let's see.  I might do something.  I might get naked first.  And that way there, that way there, I can do it right.  That sounds good.  No nudity.  No, that sounds real good, right?  Oh, don't get naked.  Yeah.  Oh, Jesus.  What's wrong with my body?  Holy shit.  What's wrong with my body? 
[00:35:30]  Holy shit.  He doesn't think you have the guts for your naked.  He said you don't have the lotion.  I did not.  Yeah, Anthony says, well, put your blindfolders on.  Put them on.  And that way there ain't nothing looking.  This whole, oh my God.  Yeah, yeah, yeah, he's got some lotion.  It hit me in, I don't know, 15 seconds?  I don't know, five feet further than me?  Anthony looks like a bank robber from 1850.  You're messing with Tippi time.  All right, Tippi, let's get into a song here, okay?  Come on.  Yes!  Now, belt one out, come on. 
[00:36:00]  Yeah, go belt one out.  Let's do another, I don't know, you got any ideas?  You got the songs in your head.  You got it, Rod Stewart?  It's bad, Jimmy.  You got it, Rod Stewart?  Dude, this whole room stinks so fucking bad.  Tom Jones?  Just sing, bro, sing.  It's acapella today, let's go.  Okay.  But I got to get some lyrics going, I hear some music.  Sing Tom Jones.  Sing some Tom Jones.  It's not unusual to be in love with anyone. 
[00:36:30]  Ma-ma-na-na-na-na-na.  It's not unusual.  I forget the rest of the words.  Ow!  I bumped my lip, damn it.  Ah, fuck.  All right, I'm going to do some Elvis Presley.  All right.  All right, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.  I'm going to do somebody else.  All right.  I'm going to do some, well, Tom Jones, Elvis Presley. 
[00:37:00]  Uh, I might do Engelberg Humperdinck.  Engelberg Humperdinck.  All right, let's hear that, bro.  Let's hear some.  Engelberg.  Well, I sing you some, something like that.  Good.  Ah!  Is it I sing you to sleep after the lovin'?  Come on, man.  You know, I'm rehearsing.  I'm trying to get my head together here.  All right.  Oh, good.  Don't touch anything. 
[00:37:30]  I don't know.  I'll do something different.  Yeah, something different.  He's got the fingernails on it.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Something more, more, more, more solid.  Like, uh, the Bee Gees.  Oh, let's hear some Bee Gees.  You should be dancing.  Something like that.  You know more than one Tom, right?  No, no, no, no.  Tom, don't you know any songs?  Give me Tom on stage right now.  Don't you know any, any song that I can't even concentrate. 
[00:38:00]  Okay, okay.  Don't you know any, oh, my God, it just hit you, Jimmy, right?  All right, I'm going back to time now.  We going way back.  All right, let's go.  Way back.  One more.  Let's go.  Come on.  The Drifters.  Oh, yeah, The Drifters.  Damn.  I'm drifting.  When this old world keeps getting me down.  Come on.  Don't tell them. 
[00:38:30]  And we say, up on the roof.  Up on the roof.  And I'll hide.  Damn.  Man, I'll blow that with you.  It is going to take a week to get this.  I can't sing either.  It's going to take a week to get the studio aired out.  I know.  It's all right.  No.  Hey, Tippy Tom, maybe you need to, like, take some clothes off to get more comfortable. 
[00:39:00]  Oh, God, no.  I think that's the problem.  Oh, you'll see some skin.  I don't think you need to take your clothes off because you're on cover.  No, you don't want to see this.  Oh, he has bug bites all over.  Oh, God.  Tippy Tom, I think you'll remember.  This is my musical director.  Help me.  All right, you want Gray Wolf in here, too, or what?  Get whooped me in here.  Oh, God, I just smelled shit.  You're supposed to help me here.  I smell like there are smells coming out of him. 
[00:39:30]  Let's do it, yeah.  One is just body odor.  The other, I just smelled shit.  Like shit.  I can think I'm sexy.  Come on, baby, let me know.  I can't do this.  I need the music, though.  Man, stop playing.  Oh, my God, Jimmy.  I think, Tippy Tom, I think you need to take some clothes off.  You're a little uncut.  Good point, O.P.  You don't want to see this body.  Well, I think you'd be able to remember a lot more words if you're more comfortable. 
[00:40:00]  And we all know you're more comfortable with your naked.  Come on, let's get busy with a song here.  All right, Gray Wolf, you're going to play a song.  All right, get on mic for a second.  Yeah, yeah.  Listen to this guy's voice, Gray Wolf.  This is the, I mean, it's been quite some time for a while that I haven't been on the air  with you all.  But I'm very privileged to be back with O.P. and Anthony, and I'm really glad that they  got this show back.  I have a song that I wrote about Tippy Toe Tommy, and this is like a couple of words that 
[00:40:30]  I will put together.  It's about the cops throwing them out every time that it rains, it gets kicked out of the  station.  All right.  So, let's see how this comes out.  Can I get your favorite towels, Jimmy?  All right.  They're right there.  All right.  Here we go.  I got to spray some.  I put it over my face.  I can't breathe.  This is a story about a man, and he always was so lonely at nights.  But his voice was rowdy. 
[00:41:00]  You could hear it all through this train station.  And I'm going to sing this one.  This is about Tippy Toe Tommy.  It's late at night, and I got nowhere to go.  And the cop says to me, hey, you smell bad. 
[00:41:30]  Get out of here.  And he says, and you know I have an angel.  And he says, that angel.  Shelter me from the falling rain.  This is my life.  I'm living with so much pain. 
[00:42:00]  Shelter me.  Ow.  Yeah.  That's just a little piece.  The rest, you have to hear it.  Can't we record it?  It sounds like the end of the documentary.  It's been quite a while.  I was the one that played flute.  End of the documentary.  It's always warm.  And if you remember me, I'm the only one from Stony Hills Mall that got a girl to bring up. 
[00:42:30]  Can we say that on the air?  You can say whatever you want.  All right.  She showed 36 double Ds.  And the announcer says, eat your heart out, Howard Stern.  We have a great wolf chief that gets a girl to show 36 double Ds on Victoria's Secret in front of 30,000 people.  Oh, wow. 
[00:43:00]  I've got to get a picture from Keefe when she did that while I was sitting on my lap.  Hey, hey, hey, Graywolf.  Graywolf.  Graywolf.  We got it.  All right.  She showed her her boobies.  Listen, do you do any Zeppelin or anything like that?  Do you play Zeppelin or anything like that?  I could do a little bit of this here.  All right.  Give us a little something more here.  What are you going to say?  Hey, Graywolf.  You still homeless or no?  No, no.  I've got my room all together.  You're doing all right now?  All right.  Good.  After we just got on the show, people started noticing me and the music. 
[00:43:30]  Yeah.  And people started calling me in.  All right.  And I got together with a beautiful group that's called Chuyaco, which means Clearwater.  Right.  We have albums.  If you like, you can play one.  Yeah, we might play a little something-something.  Timmy Tom, what do you think of your song?  Get it.  Talk into that mic.  And don't talk to it.  I exactly don't know what he's going to play.  So I have to.  What do you think about the song I wrote about you?  Oh, no.  Well, try it again. 
[00:44:00]  Let me hear it again.  Because I forgot.  This is Al Jolson.  I know.  I love his voice, man.  We've got to get him to cut some.  That's a pretty song.  All right.  He's got to cut liners for the show.  All right.  Graywolf.  Give us a little something.  Well, you're going to have to sing it.  No, I'm not.  Yeah.  You want to do a little duet, you think?  Timmy Tom, you jump in when you can.  I'm scared.  I'm scared.  I'm scared.  All right.  Listen.  You sing and I'll play.  Yeah. 
[00:44:30]  Sing.  Stairway 7.  Oh.  I don't know the lyrics. 
[00:45:00]  But I'll try.  In my heart, I will give it a try.  That's probably the most famous song ever.  And I'm so...  God, I can't get by wave after wave.  We have been so much time.  Timmy Tom.  Wait a minute.  Let's play another one.  No, now it's your turn to play. 
[00:45:30]  Yeah, that was your turn to sing there, Timmy Tom.  I'm on stage now.  Yeah, if you want to be on stage, this is the time for you to be on stage.  And I'm going to get you up.  Oh, wow.  You're going to give him a guitar?  Oh, yeah.  Timmy Tom, you know how to play the guitar?  We've been teaching him.  You've been teaching him?  I'm still in training.  You're still in training?  But he does pretty good, and he sings really good.  Well, you're going to hear some...  Let me rehearse a little bit.  All right, you rehearse a little bit.  Anthony, do you want to play that guitar? 
[00:46:00]  Twist it, twist it.  I cannot even...  I'm flabbergasted.  Why?  Because, dude, it stinks so fucking bad in here right now.  Hold on, hold on.  I've got his palms for a minute.  Let me get this together.  Well, don't lay on the lesbian couch, Tippi Tom.  We're going to need that in about an hour when Mary Carey comes in.  We've got a porn star coming in later.  Hey, Tippi Tom, you ready to do a little number for everybody?  Hold it out long.  All right, here we go.  Oh, shit, man. 
[00:46:30]  He broke the cord.  All right, come on.  Gray Wolf is hooking you up.  There you go.  Tippi Tom, step up to that microphone.  I'm trying to play the Rolling Stones.  All right, he's going to play the Rolling Stones for everybody.  Mick Jagger.  Mick Jagger?  All right.  That's more just...  Actually, you look a little like Mick Jagger these days.  Yeah.  All right, here we go.  Step up to that mic, Tippi Tom.  Here we go.  Sing it.  Ah! 
[00:47:00]  This toy ain't working, man.  Trying to get the songs together here.  All right, Tom.  Come on, Tom.  Hey, Tippi Tom, I'm happy.  Bring it up.  Bring it up a little notch.  Bring it up a little notch.  There you go.  Bring it up a little notch.  Wait, you want to play the song?  All right.  Trying to adjust the guitar strap for him.  It's not collaborating.  How much more can I pick it up?  There.  Now.  See if that's adjustable.  Dang!  Much better.  Trying to get the same thing to work.  All right.  All right, Tom. 
[00:47:30]  Let it rip, Tom.  Come on.  Like fixing a car.  Let it rip, Tom.  Here we go.  Tippi Tom singing the Rolling Stones.  Tippi Tom will do it.  Yeah.  Yeah, we got it.  Come on, Tom.  Sing.  Ah, forget it.  I quit.  No, go ahead.  No, quit.  You can't quit.  I quit.  You've never been a quitter when it comes to Tippi Tom.  Yeah, man.  Tom.  Play the guitar.  One more.  Play the guitar.  Play the guitar.  Let me sit down and do this.  All right.  Let him sit down. 
[00:48:00]  He's already sat there.  It doesn't matter anymore.  Move the mic.  Move that mic over there.  Yeah.  Sing a song, Tom.  We can hear him.  Just move that over there.  There you go.  Believe the smell in this fucking place.  I'm holding out so long.  Lord, I miss you.  I'll do the best I can.  Hey!  Hey!  Lord, I miss you.  Don't you know that I really miss you? 
[00:48:30]  Yeah!  Come on, Tom.  Nice.  Because my heart is so out of shape.  Very romantic.  Because you've been gone and you're out of my face.  Hey!  Come on, Tom.  Keep rocking.  Lord, I miss you.  Yes, I miss you.  Don't you know I miss you? 
[00:49:00]  Oh.  Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.  What's wrong, Tiffy?  Oh, God.  No!  I can't.  What's wrong, Tom?  Oh, it is solo.  Now we do something different.  All right.  You do something different.  And Eric, someone's got to hold the mic for Grey Wolf because he's going to do a little  flute solo.  We're making music on the fly here, all right?  There's a lot of time for us.  I don't want to use that if we have a recording.  Hey, Grey Wolf, would you let Tom play your flute? 
[00:49:30]  How you do I?  He can't get no sound out of it.  I tried every one of them.  All right.  Shoot the best.  I like to play with Tom all the time.  Hey!  He's one of my oldest buddies and I came from that world.  Grey Wolf, shh.  Let Tiffy Tom play.  Hold on.  Tiffy Tom.  I know, I know, I know.  You don't love me.  I'm with you.  I'm with you.  Here we go.  Listen to me.  Listen to me.  You don't love me.  Tom, Tom, this is what's going to happen.  I want to hear your music.  You play again and this is what's going to happen. 
[00:50:00]  Grey Wolf, when you're feeling it, you jump in with that flute solo.  All right.  Here we go.  Tiffy Tom on the Opie and Anthony program.  I can't get my fingers together.  You're sounding great.  Here we go.  Let's go.  Tiffy Tom.  How do you tune it?  It's all wrong.  It's out of tune, man.  It's out of tune.  This guitar is out of tune.  I'm really unhappy. 
[00:50:30]  I'm going to break this guitar over my head.  Tom, do you know any songs?  Do you know any songs?  That's a Tiffy Tom original, Anthony.  Tom, don't you know any songs?  It's a Grey Wolf guitar, stupid.  All right.  Here we go.  We've got one more.  One more.  Come on, Tom.  One more.  Over the Rainbow. 
[00:51:00]  Let's do that one.  Yeah.  Over the Rainbow.  Over the Rainbow?  Yeah.  I forget the chords.  You don't know the chords.  I do, but I forget.  Yeah, I'm going to send you back to school.  Just do it.  I'm sure you'll pick it up.  You'll pick it up.  You'll remember.  There you go.  I'm going to find it.  I'm going to find it.  Yeah, find it.  There you go.  There you go.  Very nice.  Well, it's time.  Over the Rainbow. 
[00:51:30]  Lost in a lullaby.  All right, Tom. 
[00:52:00]  You ready for the Grand Finale?  All right, I'm done.  I think I'm done.  You don't want to do the Grand Finale?  You're done?  Do what?  The Grand Finale?  I can't hear you.  The Grand Finale.  One last.  The Grand Finale?  I'll do Barry Manilow.  All right.  All right, Barry Manilow.  Let's go. 
[00:52:30]  Give it your all, because this is your last one.  Come on.  When you're feeling a great wolf, you jump in with that blue.  I guess it's the old country.  I have a special song.  Ah, shit.  I ain't played in them.  It's all wrong.  Going back to the Rolling Stones.  I ain't the only one that comes down there and takes care of him.  Ah, shut up.  Shut up. 
[00:53:00]  I'm going to do some Neil Young.  Neil Young?  Neil Young.  Here we go.  Neil Young.  I forgot, man.  I've been playing years.  Plus, I don't even know how to play it right anyway.  Come on, Tom.  Come on, Tom.  People are waiting.  Jimmy Tom does not know how to play the guitar.  All right. 
[00:53:30]  Sing something, Tom.  Look at the dirt in his fingernails are getting in the way of awful.  It's almost good.  Eric, I don't know how you're even functioning that close.  No, these candles are all worse than he does.  Yes.  It's your turn.  Your turn.  I'm taking a break.  All right.  Tibby Tom's taking a break.  Graywolf, take us out. 
[00:54:00]  Tibby Tom, take a break.  Take us out with a little flute solo, please.  This song is called A Time For Us.  This is a small moment for us.  All right.  Give me a match.  Here we go.  Graywolf.  I'll take that. 
[00:54:30]  That mic on Tom.  What do you think of that, Tom?  Tom's giving them the raspberries.  Miyagi.  Miyagi.  This is fucking horrible. 
[00:55:00]  All right.  Let's go to Rich in New Orleans.  Rich, what's up?  Hey, all man.  Love the show.  Thank you.  Isn't it times like this you wish you had one of those fucking Japanese Sarge masks to  cut the sink?  This should be the ass-smelling mask.  Right now, I have a paper towel over my face that has been sprayed with Lysol.  And I have a candle, a scented candle burning right in front of me. 
[00:55:30]  And it's still, the smell is penetrating.  Smells like acid patchouli.  Well, Danny brings a candle over for Anthony.  Yeah.  And fucking Anthony looks at it and goes, what flavor is it?  Who fucking cares?  Smells like raw shit in here.  Oh, what is it?  You don't like raspberry surprise?  Fucking candle diva.  What flavor?  What flavor?  Oh, what an idiot I am.  It's a cadaver.  As long as it is an ass.  I should be happier. 
[00:56:00]  Smells like raw shit.  What flavor?  It is raw shit in here.  Raw shit.  All right, Tibby Tom.  Let's get Tibby Tom out of the studio and Gray Wolf.  This is what's going to happen.  By the way, we've got Mary Carey coming in in a little while.  Great, and she's going to think we all stink.  A big porn star.  I'll say she is.  We're going to have Tibby Tom and Gray Wolf do the news for us today.  Oh, listen, we're moving, Tom.  All right, yeah, this is always fun.  We're getting kicked out, huh?  Yeah, you're getting kicked out.  Get out of here! 
[00:56:30]  Yeah!  You dropped something.  Obviously, we're kicked out of here.  You're kicked out of here, Tom.  All right, they'll be back in the studio.  What?  What?  All right, listen, they're going to do the news for us in a real while.  Oh, my God.  What flavor?  What flavor candle?  What an idiot, Anthony.  Scowled out of it.  What flavor?  I know.  What flavor did you choose, by the way?  I don't even know what it is. 
[00:57:00]  It says it right on the thing.  Does it?  Yeah, right on the thing.  No, because it didn't.  Oh, country fruit stand.  There you go.  All right.  These are mini-muggins candles.  I got oatmeal raisin.  See, I would like oatmeal raisin.  No, you wouldn't.  It's awful.  They're all awful.  Mini-muggins candles are awful.  But it's better than...  They're fans of the show, and they send us some free candles.  It's better than Tippy Tom ass.  All right.  Dude.  That's a good selling point for a product, by the way.  It's better than Tippy Tom's ass. 
[00:57:30]  You didn't say a word.  Opie didn't say a word about the smell.  What?  Amanda Peet.  Oh, Amanda Peet.  Really?  Nice.  Do we pick her up now?  Yeah, might as well.  All right.  Should we close the door so that smell doesn't waft in here?  Drop something.  Well, they're trying to get Amanda Peet.  Where is she?  It's on the hot...  Oh, here she is.  Amanda!  Amanda?  Yeah.  Okay.  I got Opie and Anthony for you. 
[00:58:00]  Okay, great.  Go ahead.  Hey, Amanda Peet.  It's Opie and Anthony.  How are you?  I'm good.  How are you?  Hi.  I hope you weren't listening to the radio for the last 15 or 20 minutes.  We had two homeless guys in here singing songs and stuff.  And the one guy smelled really, really bad.  So now we got lit candles in front of us.  Oh.  Yeah, it's just great.  We go from that to Amanda Peet, a big movie star.  That's right.  You're in the latest movie with Ashton, right?  I am.  And what's the movie?  You know, I didn't even know about this movie until I saw Fever Pitch the other night and 
[00:58:30]  I saw the preview and it looks like it's going to be a pretty good movie.  Oh, good.  I'm glad.  I wish I could tell you the name of the movie, but I wasn't prepared for this, to be honest  with you, because the homeless guy really threw us off.  It's called A Lot Like Love.  Okay.  And what is it about?  It's kind of like, it's kind of like When Harry Met Sally-esque.  It's about, like, these two people who can't seem to find the right timing.  And, um...  Oh, it sounds like a good date movie.  Yes.  Yes.  Yes. 
[00:59:00]  It's probably a very good date movie.  It's probably a movie to make you feel really romantic afterwards.  Aw.  So how was it working with Ashton?  I love Ashton.  Yeah.  Yeah.  We had an amazing time.  He's fantastic.  He is.  He's a goofball like me.  He's so hot right now, isn't he?  Like, everyone just seems to want Ashton.  You know, Amanda, a friend of mine is a really big fan of yours.  I mean, he's seen everything you've done, and he just says to me one time, like, Amanda 
[00:59:30]  Pete, he said, it's just, I mean, it's unbelievable.  It's unbelievable?  Yeah.  He just loves you.  He thinks you're the greatest.  Well, that's really sweet.  That's very nice to hear.  Were you privy to seeing Ashton and his lovely girlfriend?  I was.  Oh.  And how's that going?  We're all curious, you know, how we are with Hollywood.  You know, we like all the latest gossip.  It's going very well.  Yeah?  Yeah. 
[01:00:00]  Are they what you would consider a lovey-dovey couple?  They love each other very much.  Aw, that's fabulous.  Are you calling from Los Angeles, or are you here in what we call the Big Apple?  I'm in the Big Apple, my hometown.  Cool.  Oh.  Yeah, well, you're in town promoting the movie all over the place, right?  Yeah, we're going all over.  That's, uh, who do you get to talk to next?  Um, I don't even know.  Oh, they just keep handing you the phone, and then?  Exactly.  And then, uh, and then you do the interview.  Is the movie out yet, or are you just kind of gearing up for the premiere? 
[01:00:30]  Um, Friday night.  Yeah, this, uh, tomorrow night, the movie's, uh, going to be everywhere there, uh, Jimmy.  Oh, cool.  Um, so it's like...  Yeah, Jimmy, get your, get your, get your information together.  Well, Jimmy's nice.  Come on, Jimmy.  They didn't tell me anything.  I, I kind of came in late this morning.  I had a whole hibbit thing last night, and I was just, like, been up all night.  A whole what thing last night?  Just, I've been up all night.  Tired, I'm sick.  No, what?  No, she wants to know what you said, Jimmy.  I said I have been up all night.  I'm just tired.  No, she didn't really hear you.  What, what did you say to Amanda Pete?  I was sick.  I was up all night.  With what?  I'm thinking it's the flu.  Oh, all right.  Yeah. 
[01:01:00]  Of course, that's going around.  It's going around.  Mm-hmm.  Mm-hmm.  Well, we love you, Amanda.  Thank you so much.  I've been a big fan ever since, uh, I love the movie Southie.  Oh, wow.  That was a good one.  Thank you so much.  Yeah.  Yeah, I've been a big fan ever since then.  Thank you very much.  What do you, what do you have?  Like, I know that you're still working on this project now, but I'm, I've, I've done a little  acting myself.  I'm not particularly good.  I always forget my dialogue.  But do you, um, do you, do you have to, like, start the next movie before you finish, like,  with this one's premiered, or is it going to be, like, um, longer? 
[01:01:30]  I'm going to have a space right now.  I'm doing a play, you know, downtown at the Public Theater.  Oh, cool.  Right now.  So, I still have that through, uh, Sunday.  And then, and then I'm unemployed.  Hey, who told you it was a good idea to go, uh, topless in, uh, the whole nine yards?  Did?  Oh.  Oh, I didn't see that one.  Um, do you have a problem with it?  Uh, Opie.  What?  I, I didn't see it. 
[01:02:00]  Let me see.  Wait, let me see some other angles.  What, yeah, what are you talking about, Opie?  Oh, it might have been just a bad picture.  Are you guys quickly doing your research on me right now?  No, no, no, we're on, uh, Mr.  You're, like, scrambling.  No, we're not scrambling.  We're on, uh, Mr. Skin.  Why are you doing that?  Huh?  Why are you doing that?  Is that a bad thing?  It's a great picture.  Well, I mean, I guess it's fine.  No, I mean, if you're, I mean, you, you got topless in a few movies, and, uh, we're just  checking out some of the pictures.  Wow.  And Igby goes down, 2002.  That's a nice topless shot. 
[01:02:30]  Very nice.  That one is better than whole nine yards.  I don't know what was happening in whole nine yards.  Oh, well, thanks a lot.  What's the problem with everybody?  It's just a comment.  I just said how nice you looked in, uh, Igby goes.  I don't know what happened in the whole nine yards.  Well, it might have been the angle of the camera.  I don't know.  Oh, B.  So I'm saying thanks a lot.  Enough.  Well, obviously, you're beautiful.  Do you, do you, like, when, when, when they want you to do, like, a scene like that,  because a lot of people, like, do nudes at one point and go, look, I don't want 
[01:03:00]  to do them anymore.  Or do you, like, kind of refuse to do them now, or only if it's, like, the type of role  that would, like.  I don't do it.  If it's, you know, if it's really funny or really special role or whatever, you know,  I'm not, like, precious about it.  I had to do a kissing scene one time on camera.  I was very nervous.  Jimmy's a big star.  I had to kiss, you know who Nina Hartley is?  No, I don't know who that is.  She's a very, very famous, uh, porn legend.  Let me see that one.  And I had to kiss her in a film.  It was actually very nerve-wracking.  Well, not porn movies.  Why was it nerve-wracking?  I'd never done it before, so I didn't know what to expect. 
[01:03:30]  I didn't know if I should, like, kiss like you'd kiss a date or just, like, you know,  open mouth with no tongue.  I was panicking.  Yeah.  Jimmy was in Spider-Man.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  Yeah.  You had a little part in Spider-Man.  I played the Shirley truck driver.  I had one line in Spider-Man.  I'm so sorry.  I don't remember.  But he's in it.  I was just happy to be in it.  Yeah.  I'm not a particularly good actor.  I get very nervous.  Do you get nervous when you act?  I do sometimes, yeah.  What do you do? 
[01:04:00]  Um, I just try really hard not to be, but, um, I don't know.  I haven't figured it out yet.  Yeah, I...  I have to do when I'm that nervous.  I rush.  Marlon Brando is a good actor.  Yeah, he's not half bad.  No, he was.  I'm saying he was great.  Yeah.  Not anymore.  Well, not now.  No, no.  Way to go out on a limb, Jimmy.  I'm saying he was just talking acting.  Oh, you're just talking acting?  Well, no, yeah.  All right.  Yeah, he's amazing.  Well, Amanda, we loved having you on.  I apologize for, um, Opie. 
[01:04:30]  Um, you know, sometimes he gets out of line.  He looks at negatation.  Shuttle on.  I understand.  No, no.  You know what?  First of all, you didn't need to bring that up, Opie.  And secondly, you've got to appreciate the fact that an actress probably makes, uh, toils  over a decision to choose a role that includes some nudity.  And then to, to, you know, even imply that there's something wrong there.  I didn't say there's something wrong.  Now I'm seeing another shot from the whole nine yards.  It's a beautiful girl.  And, uh, you're arching your back a little, little bit, and they look much, much nicer. 
[01:05:00]  See, that's what they call a backhanded compliment.  You're, he's like this all the time, and it's very embarrassing.  No, it was just the angle, so I'm going to apologize.  I mean, I, I would suggest if you do the topless, uh, scenes, you just don't, uh, lean forward  too much.  Or I could not talk to you afterwards, you know.  That, thank you, because I think that's the solution to this problem.  Amanda, obviously you're beautiful, and, uh.  Thank you.  And we're just messing with you. 
[01:05:30]  It was just one shot that looked a little weird, that's all.  I mean, but if I sit here and try to act like you're not smoking, you know, people are going  to call me out on it.  Obviously you are.  Well, thank you.  I appreciate that.  Uh, a lot like Love premieres tomorrow night, and it's going to be in theaters all over, right?  Uh, yes it is.  You guys have pretty high expectations, because if it's like, I mean, when Harry Met Sally  was big.  Yeah, no, I mean, I'm just saying, like, the story is a similar kind of idea.  I'm not saying, I mean, we can only hope to be, to be like when Harry Met Sally, but, 
[01:06:00]  um, but yeah, it's a similar kind of idea.  Do you guys get together in the end, or?  Don't tell them that.  Don't spurl it.  Don't spurl it.  O.P.  Arena.  Do you ever get, like, this is a question, when you're, like, acting, I guess I always want  to know, like.  All right, sorry.  I have an acting question.  Go ahead.  Do you ever get, like, like, really attracted to the person that you're acting with, like,  all of a sudden you're like, this person would probably want to, you know, go for  something, like, or whatever?  Um, you know, I think that everybody knows that it's just playing, and, I mean, I guess 
[01:06:30]  some people fall in love, but that's never happened to me.  All right, I got to go to Bill real fast in Pennsylvania.  Bill, yes.  Guys, I just wanted to say, this is one of the best interviews I've ever heard, because  you are so completely unprepared, you have absolutely no clue what to ask, and I can  hear you typing favorably to find out as much information as possible.  It is outstanding.  See, Amanda, we abuse ourselves, too, so it's not just you. 
[01:07:00]  The problem is, we knew you were going to call in, and, of course, we know who Amanda  Pete is, but then we had the homeless.  Hello?  Oh.  Hello?  And then we had the homeless guys come in, and then we got thrown off our game.  That's all.  That's okay.  Listen, it's totally fine.  Look, look, look, I'm going to put Mark from Oklahoma City on the line.  Mark, what's up?  Hi, boys.  How you doing?  Good.  Hi, Mark.  Hey, guys.  Hey, I've got to say one thing.  Amanda, you are smoking.  I loved you in that movie, Identity. 
[01:07:30]  Thank you very much.  You were out in the rain, and everything was kind of like showing in the wetness.  Guys, I think it's time to play Guess What's in My Pants, punching out my mom.  All right.  Oh, that's right, Identity.  That was a really good movie.  Thank you.  I really like that one.  Which one was that again?  The one with John Cusack, Ray Liotta.  They're at that motel.  Oh, that was a great movie.  That was a good movie.  I forgot.  That was well written.  Brad in Michigan.  If we were prepared, we would have known that.  Hey, Brad.  Amanda.  Yo.  You are so fucking hot. 
[01:08:00]  All right.  I want you and Dr. Peter.  Would you not get on?  That was Pat O'Brien.  That was Pat O'Brien.  Insider, you know, that's from the show Insider, Pat O'Brien.  Have you heard those tapes of O'Brien losing his mind, Amanda?  I haven't heard them.  I've only heard about them.  Oh, they're just absolutely amazing.  They really are.  What is that tapping on the phone?  Is that the publicist signaling you?  I have no idea.  Yeah.  Of course it is.  That must be.  Wow.  They're freaked out.  That's the tap of get out.  Get out of this, Amanda. 
[01:08:30]  All right, Amanda P.  We'll let you be.  A little tap on the phone.  All right.  You guys have a good day.  You know, good luck with the movie.  I'm sure it's going to be a hit for you.  Thank you so much.  All right, there she goes, Amanda P.  There.  Bye.  Take it easy.  Bye.  You are so nasty.  It's hysterical.  Tap on the phone.  The tap on the phone.  That was the publicist.  Tick, tick, tick, tick.  Hang up.  You are so nasty.  I just probably, you know how it is.  I just know every woman is self-conscious, and obviously she's beyond smoking, and I knew 
[01:09:00]  that just saying something like that would just freak her out.  I just wish we could get some of these people in the studio so we could chat and get to know  each other.  Yeah.  Maybe she falls in love with one of the radio guys.  Oh, you would think that might happen?  Possibly.  Yeah.  Could happen.  No.  No, never.  Why not?  All right.  We're going to regroup here.  Tibby, Tom, and Graywolf are going to do the news for us?  They're rehearsing.  They're rehearsing the news?  Yeah.  Look, they get there.  How do you not just completely get distracted and not able to function as a radio host with 
[01:09:30]  the smell?  Anthony, you've got to be a professional.  No, I'm a professional.  You've got to just be a professional and plow forward.  Something could happen to my headphones and stuff, and I'll plow through, things like  that.  If there's a distraction going off to the side, my peripheral vision, I could still  go.  But something about the smell of shit wafting from a human being and just like dying flesh  and shit that I cannot function. 
[01:10:00]  When he is in here, I can't smell that.  It is disturbing to me.  He was touching everything.  All right.  He's screaming out there.  Something's going on.  He's screaming like a lunatic.  He's reading his news copy, and he's screaming.  Yeah.  They put it in the huge font.  Look how big the font is.  They put it in this huge font, and he's got to read the news, and he's yelling.  He's yelling at his producer.  I'm not going to read this crap.  Why don't you read it, Billy boy? 
[01:10:30]  Come on, Billy.  All right.  What a mess of a show so far.  That's great.  We've got to talk about the third teacher arrested in a sex scandal here in New York City, Anthony.  The third in a week, I believe.  The teachers are definitely not as attractive as they were when this whole scandal first started  popping up about a year ago.  No.  We'll do the news with these guys, and we'll do some news ourselves.  Also, this co-worker, they're calling him Mega Meanie.  I guess they did one of those office pools where you get the lottery tickets. 
[01:11:00]  Oh, yeah, yeah.  And this one office hit, and the guy turned around and said, I'm not sharing.  Yeah.  He hit for $175,000.  He hit for $175,000 and said, nope, I'm not sharing.  When you think of taxes that come out of that and what you would get, and then if you split  it with your office people, the difference between $175,000 and splitting it up so you're  sitting there with maybe $15,000, $10,000, $15,000 when it's all said and done, fuck them.  Yeah.  You got the ticket.  It's yours. 
[01:11:30]  I would take the money, quit my job, and go find some new co-workers.  But they're calling him Mega Meanie.  Mega Meanie.  You got Mega Stinky outside.  And other things on the way here.  Bill Burr.  Huh?  Oh, yeah.  Bill Burr's coming in today, too.  Oh, he is?  Yes.  You want to like to see?  Every time Bill comes in here, last time was Bernie Gatz.  Now he's got Tom.  He's got Tippi Tom and Mary Carey.  I'd like to see Anthony and Tom cuddling on a nice white sheet bed with them feeding you truffles  with those dirty fingers. 
[01:12:00]  That's fantastic.  He doesn't do enough drugs and pass out, and you might dream something like that.  His palms are filthy.  Dude, he has the hands and the fingernails of a corpse.  I'm telling you, when they have those shows on TV and the detective has to cut the nails  for evidence, that's the hand you see.  Dude, his hand, it is as if, and he probably has been crawling in the streets, like in the gutters.  His fingernails look like seasons one through four of the Forensic Files.  The very worst of the Opie and Anthony F.U. Life. 
[01:12:30]  Yeah, I want to leave a big fuck you to the fucking idiotic interns that answer the fucking  phones, man.  You guys are fucking assholes.  Sit there and somebody's talking about something and say, oh, it's not an issue and hang up.  You fucking faggots need to get a real job and stop being ONA's little bitches getting  their coffee and shit.  Go get a real job and work like real fucking men, faggots.  Cal Hoperson, you fucking pussy.  Get your lazy ass up and get to work. 
[01:13:00]  Fuck you.  Yeah, this is a great big fuck you to John and Jeff.  You son of a bitch's answer's a goddamn phone so I can get my goddamn thin, herky, jerky,  gravy legs, motherfucker, punch out into you.  Into the fucking phone, you cocksuckers.  Yeah, I want to send a big F.U. out to Platt.  You get all pissed off, call me a fucking cockblocker because you spend three hours hitting on some  chick and can't get anywhere, you fucking in-Britt, Missouri fuck. 
[01:13:30]  Who was that bitch anyway, your fucking sister?  Fuck you, pussy.  I don't care.  Fuck you.  Yeah, I want to leave a big F.U. to Steve or whoever the fuck goes through these damn  things and puts them together.  Steve, put some fucking women on there.  I know you got some fucking bitches calling up saying fuck you.  I'm getting tired of listening to these old grab-ass fuckers like me calling in and bitching  all the time.  I know these fucking women, bitch.  Hell, they bitch more than we do.  And fuck you to whoever made this piece of shit phone I'm talking on. 
[01:14:00]  Fuck you, mini-me.  I hope someone detaches your head from your bloated little disgusting body and puts it in a  fucking blender.  Fuck you.  I'm saying a big fuck you to all you goddamn smokers.  I get tired of walking in the restaurant to eat a meal.  I have to smell your stinking cigarette smoke.  I hope all you fuckers die of lung cancer in a painful bed.  Fuck you, smokers.  This is an F.U.  Lady Di.  Early in the morning.  Sounds like your great-grandmother screeching in your ear. 
[01:14:30]  Knock it off.  Fuck everybody.  Call the O.B. and Anthony F.U. line at 1-866-FU-LINE-1.  1-866-FU-LINE-1.  Well, fuck you very much.  O.B. and Anthony.  XM-202.  Ah, we're back with the O.B. and Anthony program. 
[01:15:00]  We have four candles now burning here in the studio.  Four of them.  Four scented candles.  Well, because the guys are getting ready for the news today.  It's Tippi Tom, the homeless guy that's gay with AIDS.  And his pal, just a pal, by the way.  They're not sleeping with each other, right? 
[01:15:30]  Grey Wolf.  I wish I could describe the smell.  It's, it's, you know what it is?  It's hot and heavy and thick.  Yeah.  The smell, it's just, it hangs in the air.  It's that homeless guy, piss, shit, rotting body smell.  Smells like?  A loss.  Yeah.  It smells, the shit smell is the smell of caked shit.  It's caked.  It's caked. 
[01:16:00]  It's caked.  Like, when he sits down, you can almost picture it stuck between his cheeks.  And when he sits down, it peels the cheeks apart a little bit.  And makes it smell more because of the peel.  Yeah.  It's like a fruit roll-up.  When you first peel it off of that plastic, you really get the smell of it.  And that's what happens when he, when he moves and his, his ass cheeks spread apart.  My apologies to Ninny Muggins.  My, by the way, I'll, thank you for the candles.  We love them now.  Ninny Muggins Candles. 
[01:16:30]  Go to NinnyMuggins.com.  All right.  Very good.  They're saving us.  They sent some candles in to us.  They're really not that bad at all.  No, no.  You know what it is?  They're too overpowering when you open them up and smell them, like, right out of the jar.  But at lit, like, you're supposed to do a candle, kind of filling the room up and helping us out.  All right.  Very good.  So those guys will be in here in a few minutes to do the news.  Also, the porn star Mary Carey is coming in.  She got arrested the other night.  Yeah.  She got arrested in Washington, Washington State.  For doing what?  For touching herself. 
[01:17:00]  I guess she was fingering herself on the stage of a strip club.  What are you supposed to do?  And the cops come in and, you know, what?  This is one of those situations where there aren't children that might innocently be passing by and see a chick fingering herself.  It's a fucking strip club.  There are guys in there that want to see this.  They're paying to see it.  They're sitting there watching girls, and to have one of them diddle herself is a treat.  Rules are rules, Anthony.  But those rules are ridiculous.  Rules are rules.  You know, you can almost, you'd almost have a harder time arguing if it's something where they can say the children, 
[01:17:30]  because they always pull out that friggin' children thing.  The children.  It's a strip club.  The clientele that is walking in knows what they're in for.  That's what they're paying for.  And they've got to go in and bust these chicks for just, you know, giving these guys a show.  They're on their way home from work, hanging out with the boys.  You want to catch a little show, have a little fun after work.  And these stupid fucking politicians got to ruin it by making these rules with these girls. 
[01:18:00]  So what?  She's touching herself.  She's taking her finger and touching herself.  Have the rules.  What the hell is that going to do?  Have the rules, but let them do, you know, I'll sneak a little illegal activity in every once in a while.  These guys are going back to their miserable lives.  It's a quick stop off.  You know, and...  Let them get a quick smile.  Well, the community has the right to say that they want certain behaviors and that they don't.  If it's prostitution, it's one thing.  All right.  That's a crime.  Whatever.  But, you know, touching themselves. 
[01:18:30]  What's wrong with that?  Where's the problem if a girl's fingering herself on a stage and you're watching it?  Because it's public lewdness.  It isn't public.  You can't have that in a community.  It's a private establishment.  But it's still a public place.  There's age restrictions.  People know what they're getting when they walk in.  They don't think I'm walking to a border's books.  Where am I?  What is she doing?  That never happens.  A lot of people don't want that kind of smut in their community.  And I can't say I blame them.  Exactly. 
[01:19:00]  I'm all for channel blocking.  People are lying.  Oh, stop.  Oh, how'd that go yesterday?  Jim, I'll tell you right now.  I completely caved.  They wore me down so badly that I was almost in tears.  I wanted to go home.  I was so tired from not sleeping.  We were here afternoon.  You guys did the channel blocking?  And I was laying here going, I don't care.  I'll say anything.  Get me out of here.  Well, yeah, we ended the show yesterday with a really, really good rant.  I'd be one of those guys in Hanoi going, yes, it is an unjust war. 
[01:19:30]  I'd be one of those soldiers that just blurted out, I was tortured for an hour.  Why didn't you just say, forget it, we're leaving, and go home?  Why not just go home if they refused?  They made you do the copy?  The Elo's on the phone, the guys who phoned from Boston.  What did Elo say?  Hold on, let's back up a little bit, because we've got to get everyone on the same page.  Yeah, get everyone on board.  Because this is like a soap opera, this show.  Sometimes we leave storylines hanging.  Well, we got a good end to the story that we started yesterday.  Basically, they're doing a 10-second commercial for Anthony and I. 
[01:20:00]  That's going to be, I'm here in a national spot, by the way.  So it's a really big deal.  I know it's only 10 seconds, but it'll help the show as far as getting the word out there.  And we didn't see the script until we were supposed to record the spot yesterday,  and we had a huge problem, because the script basically was Anthony and I talking about this channel blocking.  Now, that's something XM wants to do.  That's fine, but our point was we shouldn't be the guys ranting and raving and talking about channel blocking, okay? 
[01:20:30]  All right?  So we're not doing the script, so it was a big, big deal, because they flew guys in to record this for us, and blah, blah, blah.  It just would have sounded ridiculous for us to be talking about the channel blocking.  Right.  If they wanted it on a disclaimer, fine.  If they want a voiceover to say it, put it in print on the bottom of the little commercial thing, fine.  Print, not voiceover.  But to have us saying it is ridiculous.  Right.  And you know what?  So we got on the phone with Eric Logan, and we talked about it for about an hour.  It's a 10-second stupid commercial.  Right, right, right. 
[01:21:00]  We talked to him for about an hour, and he agreed with us, by the way, big time.  Mm-hmm.  Big time.  Until we were rewriting the script on the fly, and he's like, you know, guys, just as a goof,  so I could show Hugh Pinero how bad it would be that you guys did the channel blocking.  Oh, just give him one.  Never buy that.  And it's like, that's the one they use.  Hold on, but guaranteed.  So Eric Logan pulls that out of his corporate management back pocket, and I'm like, Eric,  you don't think we're going to fall for this, do you? 
[01:21:30]  Because he had all these other ones that he liked, you know, talking about how we're uncensored  and honest and all this crap, right?  And then he's like, eh, just as a goof, just give me one where you're talking about channel  blocking, just so I could show Hugh how awful it would be.  And I'm like, did you get that out of your management for dummies book?  Have them do the one that they don't want to do to show how bad it is.  Do you think you're talking to a morning show from Reno, Nevada?  Are you insane?  Yeah, that's what he said. 
[01:22:00]  I like him.  I like him.  I like him.  We're seeing right through this clever rouge.  We're seeing through this clever blush.  Trying to pull this eyeliner on us.  I remember one time, it's the same thing, we were doing Tough Crowd, and Colin wanted to  do it one way, and Liz Stanton is going to do it the other way.  And then Colin's like, I want to do it this way.  He's like, all right, well, just give us one like that, and when it's not good, he goes,  how fucking long do you think I've been in show business yet?  You think I'm going to fall for that shit?  Give us the one.  Yeah, we'll just want to see. 
[01:22:30]  So we can see.  That's their own.  And absolutely, it's the one they use every single time.  That's their way of getting it to do it.  Because you get distracted, because all the other copies look great.  What about that MTV thing you taped, and they said, give us one for safety.  What was the safety?  I think I know which one.  It was, you were taping something, one of those pilot things you did for MTV, and you had taped  it the way that you wanted to do it, but then they told you to do this other one that wasn't  as risque as the one that you had done. 
[01:23:00]  And it's just for safety, just so it's there, just in case we need it.  And you absolutely know that's the one they're going to use.  Absolutely.  I think I did five pilots for them in the time we were off, believe it or not, and so it  could have been any one of them.  Yeah.  But that's what they do.  That's their whole little trick.  They just see a line that's too edgy, and they go, yeah, let's just do this.  We really want to keep the other, but just to show that.  Yeah, take the stuff out that you said.  Take this, this, and this out, just so we've got something to look at.  Just so I can show Hugh.  He's going to walk in with a tape recorder, and go, Hugh, the guys were right. 
[01:23:30]  Listen.  Yeah, I know.  See how stupid this sounds?  No.  That's the one they used.  So I hope the listeners understand, we do throw a lot of energy into the show every  day, and at 11 o'clock, we still are hyper, like we're on crystal meth or something, but  as the minutes tick by, the energy starts leaving us, and we get really, really tired.  That's it.  And without whining, you know, without sounding like I'm whining, yesterday was one of those  days where I just did not get sleep the night before.  Right. 
[01:24:00]  If I get a good night's sleep.  So you were tired to begin with.  Yeah.  If I get a good night's sleep, fine.  I'll, you know, I'll hang out in here and work, do whatever we got to do after the  show.  That's fine.  But on those nights where I didn't get sleep, all I'm thinking is getting in the truck and  going home.  And every minute that ticks by is more traffic, longer it's going to take.  It was one of those nightmare days.  And then they bring the people in, the recordings have to be done.  It's almost like at 11 o'clock, we both have a fistful of Valium that we take. 
[01:24:30]  Yeah.  And then it's just a matter of time before it kicks in.  Before it kicks in.  You know, that's why, and everyone knows that.  So at 11 o'clock, there's a lot of things we have to record for whatever, all sorts of  stuff.  Yeah.  So everyone knows.  11 o'clock, keep that tape rolling because we still have that energy.  So after the long meeting with Elo, rewriting copy, finally the guys that flew in from Boston  came in.  And it was now after 12 o'clock.  Yeah.  So now we're just like tired.  And you're sitting around really doing nothing for an hour, which really kind of gets you, 
[01:25:00]  you know.  And I know, no one is really going to understand.  I'm just trying to like set this up.  This is the way it is.  I don't care if they understand or not.  You guys are fucking prima donna.  Shut up.  They don't want to look like douchebags on a national commercial.  Right.  So this is, but this is the reality.  This is what happens.  The energy goes away.  So, and the thing is now, so we had got, we were on the phone with Elo discussing other  options, other things that we could say that, and, and it's a 10 second spot.  So we're talking one quick sentence from Opie and one quick response sentence from me. 
[01:25:30]  Can't be any longer than that.  We can't have a dialogue.  It's Opie saying something, me responding.  So Elo's coming up with these lines for Opie, like, hey, it's Opie and Anthony, and we're  back on XM Satellite Radio.  And then he goes, and then Anthony, you come up with some funny quip to that.  Right.  Like, what could I possibly say?  Hold on.  In response to that.  I'm going to defend you.  I mean, it was the, it was the classic, I'm playing the straight man, and you're going  to do a little, uh, quick little quip. 
[01:26:00]  I'm supposed to do a quick little quip.  And, uh, well, they were trying to write your lines, and I'm like, you know, this is how  it works with us.  You know, we just, we just create magic on the fly.  So don't worry, Elo.  Magic.  Well, because I'm about to play the tape, and it's really funny, because even I was in shock.  I'm like, I'm doing the setup line, the straight line, and then staring at Anthony, and he  has absolutely nothing.  I have nothing.  And then we got three or four, you know, big-time, like, producers in here, and a writer, and 
[01:26:30]  all sorts of stuff.  And I could see them starting to look at each other like, oh, my God.  And I just lost my mind.  I lost my fucking mind.  We got the tape.  Because I have...  That's why the long setup here.  We got the tape, and it's really freaking funny.  No, there's no way to respond in humorous fashion to someone going, hey, Anthony, we're  here.  Oh, okay.  How about, hey, Anthony, we're on XM...  It's open, Anthony, we're on XM Satellite Radio, and you respond, you mean I can say fuck 
[01:27:00]  and not get beeped?  But they beeped the fuck.  Right.  See, that would be good, but no, no.  Instead, they had, you know, hey, we're here on XM Satellite Radio, and so is channel blocking.  Right.  Something like that.  Well, why didn't they just do that?  You mean I could say, and not get beeped?  So that kind of gets the question of what, it's uncensored, it's whatever.  Well, no, don't use uncensored.  That kind of brings back people's minds to what you were doing, and...  Is that really the argument?  Not really.  Look, because I don't need Jimmy Luz's mind again.  The reality is, Elo was definitely on our side. 
[01:27:30]  I know that, but other people in the company aren't.  I love the Elo.  Not really.  His explanation was pretty good about the whole thing.  Here's what Eric Logan is.  He's a brilliant guy, and Eric Logan can spin anything.  He's amazing.  Oh, I know.  Dude.  He was spinning right in front of us, and we're like, stop the top.  We know what's going on here.  You don't want to be involved with the rate hike.  You don't want your name mentioned.  Good point, Elo.  And then you walk away.  You're like, what the fuck did I just good point him for?  That was awful.  He's already back on a plane.  The thing about the channel blocking was not to have us say it on the ad and make it sound like we are pushing this channel blocking. 
[01:28:00]  It was supposed to be this sarcastic thing where we're like, yeah, the channel blocking.  Like, we're making fun of it.  And I believe that, by the way.  I really do.  The problem is people that don't understand humor are the ones thinking this is a good idea.  I don't believe it.  I know.  I never will.  Jim is a conspiracy nut.  No, no, no, no.  I really do believe it. 
[01:28:30]  At first I didn't, but after the explanation, I really do believe that's how it went down.  Because they're not insisting that we do it.  They're like, okay, that's cool.  No problem.  Do it your way.  I'm serious.  So we're going to roll the tape here.  All right.  I want to try to focus because this is where the funny is.  Anthony.  Oh, boy.  Anthony just getting.  They wore me down.  First of all, they wore him down because we weren't going to do the whole channel blocking thing.  They wanted us to improvise.  Anthony is amazing at improvising.  Thank you, Opie. 
[01:29:00]  But as you can hear from this tape, Anthony has absolutely nothing.  He's getting more and more tired, more and more agitated.  Yes, agitated.  And this gets really, really funny.  I should have been home in my lounging pants by then.  So let's go to the tape.  Here's us trying to come up with 10 seconds for an XM national spot for the Opie and Anthony program.  Oh, boy.  Hey, it's Opie and Anthony spreading the ONA virus nationwide on XM satellite radio.  There's no salve for this.  That's awful.  That was his first attempt. 
[01:29:30]  There's no salve?  There's no salve for this.  You did a salve for the virus.  Oh, all right, all right.  I thought it was kind of, you know.  Okay, wait, wait.  Can we hear that again?  Salve is kind of a funny, medicinal thing.  I missed the first one.  Okay, I got it.  Most artists aren't willing to put themselves out there in the creative process.  You've got to throw yourself out there.  Some of those brilliant lines that you know and love, they had to go through a lot of awful lines to get to that brilliant line.  You know, the salve thing, because salve is kind of a funny, medicinal thing.  You know, as far as medicines go, your salves are very funny. 
[01:30:00]  Salves are up there.  Yeah.  Yeah.  They blow right by aspirin and stop short of cocktail.  Wow, the Today Show is interviewing a 96-year-old skydiver.  Oh.  Ugh.  He doesn't even use a parachute, his scrotum.  Damn it, that was my joke!  His scrotum and his ears.  I'm setting myself up, you ass!  Ugh!  That was going to be my only funny line today.  Well, we share that one. 
[01:30:30]  All right.  You're big nuts.  You get the assist.  Thank you.  I guess that was the obvious joke, huh?  I'm Captain Obvious a lot.  Not really.  You could have, like, a heart attack joke or something.  Nah, it was all about the scrotum being the parachute.  Nah, it was all about the scrotum being the parachute.  All right, here we go.  Hey, it's Opie and Anthony spreading the ONA virus nationwide on XM Satellite Radio.  There's no salve for this.  That's awful.  Radio that's real, honest, and funny.  If by that I mean dishonest, sarcastic drivel, then you're right. 
[01:31:00]  Unpredictable, unleashed, unruly, and we're back.  Unwashed, unkempt, unslept.  Unbelievable.  Un-fucking-believable.  Yep.  You could already tell that.  This is us sorting it out.  Yeah, this is us trying to figure it out on the fly.  And you could already tell that Anthony's getting up.  I am so not into this.  But in fairness, it is very hard to improv one, one.  That's it.  That's a really rough one to do.  We've been able to do that. 
[01:31:30]  That's not the problem here.  For one line, like, it really is a bad situation to be in.  This is what you should have done.  Try the line.  This is an improv.  Just try the line.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  Honest, funny radio.  And we hate blacks.  We don't hate blacks.  Of course not.  Great to submit.  That is the only response.  This isn't the bell of truth.  This doesn't look at truth.  This just takes what's coming out and judges it. 
[01:32:00]  Okay.  I kind of felt bad on people.  I just like black people.  No, no, no, no.  I don't dislike.  Bell of truth?  Bell of truth.  Now I need a bell of truth.  Oh, believe me.  That's going to be a name on whack bag, and that's a new one.  What did we learn?  Bell of truth.  The bell of truth.  For the new listeners, that's the inappropriate bell.  Yes, it is.  Anytime anything inappropriate is said, this gets us out of trouble.  And that means you don't have to call the program.  Right, because we understand it was inappropriate.  There you go. 
[01:32:30]  It's just our way of not dealing with the complaint calls.  He's got nothing.  I got fucking nothing.  There's zero.  Zero coming through on this.  These are my lines from the last fucking recording.  Ugh.  I'm done.  I can't fucking function.  Let's see what else we got here.  I can't think up anything.  Something is said, and nothing comes to my mind, because I'm fucking spent.  Radio that's real, honest, and funny?  Yeah.  What? 
[01:33:00]  Sure.  What?  Not a clue.  Spreading the ONA virus nationwide on XM Satellite Radio?  These do nothing for me.  I like that last one.  No matter how many times they're read, I have no response for any of these.  What?  Jimmy?  I like that one.  What?  Which one?  What?  I don't know.  Yeah, what?  I don't know.  What are you talking about?  Yeah, I know.  Just two idiots.  Both of you and Anthony, XM, what?  Yeah, fine.  I have no clue.  We'll see how good these guys are at producing, because we didn't give them much to work with.  I was really cranky, man.  You hear me just diva. 
[01:33:30]  Dude, this is nothing.  I am pitching.  This is nothing.  I've had it.  He's just beginning to lose his mind.  Yeah.  Okay.  I have no response for these.  It's Opie and Anthony spreading the ONA virus nationwide on XM Satellite Radio.  I'm going to jump.  I'm jumping out the fucking window.  I'll get some sheets for you.  I've got nothing for this.  I know, I know, I know.  This isn't like the show.  We're talking back and forth and stuff.  I could study these.  Spreading the ONA virus nationwide on XM Satellite Radio.  What do I say?  Yeah. 
[01:34:00]  Yeah, Opie.  That's right.  That's right.  Okay, terrific.  We're back.  And now have our show on XM Satellite Radio.  Yeah.  I mean, there's no fucking response to these.  Now we have our show on XM.  You're making the guys in the booth laugh.  There's nothing here.  Radio that's real, honest, and funny.  I've been sitting in this fucking chair since last night. 
[01:34:30]  Pretty much.  I'm spent.  I've got nothing left in the tank.  Spreading the ONA virus?  No?  Nothing?  We're back and now have our show on XM Satellite Radio?  Yeah, that's just a cornucopia of responses.  A cornucopia?  Yes, I said cornucopia of responses I have for that one.  Like, the big horn of plenty is there and all the responses of, there's so many, they're  pouring out the front of it, Jimmy.  The cornucopia.  That's what I meant.  The horn of plenty.  The horn of plenty of responses. 
[01:35:00]  I was really tired.  I had to go.  When I see that thing at Thanksgiving, I just kick it on the floor.  The cornucopia.  Let it just scatter all over the kitchen.  Back and have our show on XM Satellite Radio.  Yeah, we do.  Cut.  Print it.  Cut.  Print.  Perfect.  I like to wear women's clothing.  Let's shoot this fucker.  All right, Bella, you're coming out of the house. 
[01:35:30]  You're saying XM Satellite Radio.  You're back on it.  Go.  I have nothing, Eddie.  These fuckers write shitty scripts, Eddie.  I can't say XM Satellite Radio put us back on the air because I have a really big problem  with the word put.  I can't really say it.  I say put.  XM Satellite Radio put us back on the air.  Why do they haunt me with that word? 
[01:36:00]  Put.  That's great, though.  They put us back on the air.  Couldn't they just say they placed us back on the air?  XM Satellite Radio placed us back on the air, Anthony.  Oh, now only channel blocking can keep us off.  Ha ha ha!  Yeah, they're still trying to get us to do the one thing they want us to do.  I'm a beaten man now.  I don't give a fuck.  If it gets me out of here, I'll say, and I suck cock every day on XM Satellite Radio. 
[01:36:30]  Yeah, good take.  I could go home.  Holy shit.  They're wearing us down.  They totally worn us down.  They got us.  I am such a strong advocate of channel blocking now.  I want everyone to know about it in my own voice.  I love channel blocking.  XM is happy to put us back on the air as long as there's channel blocking.  Right.  Anthony, now that we're on XM, we can say anything we want.  Lock up the kids unless you have channel blocking.  Channel blocking, channel blocking, channel blocking.  I love the fucking channel blocking. 
[01:37:00]  Oh, God.  XM, happy to have us back on the air.  And they celebrated by adding, that's right, fucking channel blocking.  I'm beaten.  They won.  You beat me.  I'm done.  It's over, Johnny.  I'm a shell of a man.  I am sleep deprived.  And they put this off and jerked us off enough today where I'm just, I don't care.  I'll read anything.  I'll read anything.  Anthony likes women's underwear.  You'd like to wear them, right? 
[01:37:30]  I wear women's underwear on XM Satellite Radio.  If you don't want to hear me talking about it, get the channel blocking.  That's right.  Oh, my God.  How do you feel about strap-on dildos?  Strap-on dildos.  I bend over and take it in the ass.  If this story shocks you, please get the channel blocking that is so available.  Fuck a duck.  I've fucked a duck.  Channel blocking, channel blocking, channel blocking.  I've had it.  I'm done.  Where did Anthony go? 
[01:38:00]  Anthony?  I'm done.  Anthony?  I'm taking my headphones off.  Here I go.  I'm leaving.  We're punching out.  At this point, this is where Anthony and I don't even acknowledge that the other one exists  until tomorrow morning at 7 a.m.  Now go get my limo.  There you have it.  That's what they have to work with for the 10-second national spot. 
[01:38:30]  I like to wear women's clothing on XM Satellite Radio.  It would be a funny little Ed Wood thing.  It doesn't have to be Ope first and then you.  You could say that and you could say back on XM Satellite Radio.  Yeah.  It could open with a silly line like that.  But it didn't include the channel blocking.  It doesn't matter.  So it probably won't make it up.  I like to wear women's clothing on XM Satellite Radio.  Yeah.  Ope and Anthony show.  We're back.  You know, we can't say uncensored.  Why can't you say uncensored?  Whatever.  We'll see what they make of it.  Nothing.  Ben, you got something?  Ben, what's going on? 
[01:39:00]  The boss wants to know.  Bill's here.  Bill Burr's here.  A little mortified of Tippy Tom.  Tippy Tom went to the bathroom.  So we've sent Travis in with his pants.  No, well, he might fall asleep in there again.  All right.  Why don't we get Bill Burr in here?  We're going to take a break.  Go grab Bill.  Yeah.  By the time we're back, Bill Burr will be in studio.  They're calling me Orson Welles on instant feedback.  I did it right the first time.  Do we have that as we go to break?  The Orson Welles thing?  Do we have a good copy of that these days? 
[01:39:30]  Find me a jury.  I'll go down on you.  I don't want to say channel blocking.  It's not rewarding.  Channel blocking.  Channel blocking.  It's just it doesn't roll off the tongue.  Crisp crumb coating.  Channel blocking.  Which one do you want to hear, Anthony?  Directions from one person or...  Yeah, I think that's the one, right?  Any one of them are gold.  All right.  What's the setup on this?  Why don't we come back?  Bill Burr in studio and also Tippy Tom and Gray Wolf doing the news for us.  This was Orson Welles during the end of his career, I think,  when he was making money doing commercial reads. 
[01:40:00]  And he was really a prima donna in the studio, much like me yesterday.  And he was complaining about copy and the people that were running the recording machines  and anything else he can complain about.  All right.  Let's go to this tape as we take a break.  Nothing is more important than the simple act of people getting together.  Good.  Could I have one more go, Orson, please?  Sorry.  What?  Could I have just one more take of that?  Why?  I just did it right.  Yeah.  Look, I'm not used to having more than one person in there. 
[01:40:30]  One more word out of you and you go.  Is that clear?  Yes, sir.  I take directions from one person under protest.  But from two, I don't sit still.  Who the hell are you, anyway?  No, I'm the engineer.  Well, why the hell are you asking me for another one?  Well, I thought there was a slight bonk and I would just like to be safe.  Jesus.  What is a gonk?  Do you mind telling me what that is?  It's not a bang from outside. 
[01:41:00]  A bang from outside.  A bang from outside.  Could I see Mrs. Rogers for a minute, please?  Yes, certainly.  Do you really mean that?  Yeah, so in other words, I'd start half a second later.  Don't you think you really want to say July over the snow?  Isn't that the fun of it?  If you make it almost when that shot disappears, it'll make my... 
[01:41:30]  I think it's so nice that you see a snow-covered field and say every July, peas grow there.  We know a remote farm in Lincolnshire where Mrs. Buckley lives.  Every July, peas grow there.  We aren't even in the fields, you see?  Yeah, we aren't.  We're talking about them growing and she's picked them.  Yeah.  On what?  On in July.  I don't understand you, then.  When must...  What must be over for July?  When we get out of that snowy field.  When I was out, we were onto a can of peas, a big dish of peas when I said in July. 
[01:42:00]  Oh, I'm sorry.  Yes, always.  I'm always past that.  You are?  Yes.  Well, that's about where I say in July.  Could you emphasize a bit in?  In July.  Why?  That doesn't make any sense.  Sorry.  There's no known way of saying an English sentence in which you begin a sentence with in and emphasize it.  Get me a jury and show me how you can say in July and I'll go down on you. 
[01:42:30]  That's just idiotic if you'll forgive me if I say so.  That's just stupid.  In July.  I'd love to know how you emphasize in and in July.  Impossible.  Meaningless.  I think all they were thinking about was that they didn't want to.  He isn't thinking.  Well, sir, can we just do one last one?  Yeah?  And it was my fault I said in July.  If you can leave every July.  You didn't say it.  He said it.  Your friend.  Every July?  No, you don't really mean every July. 
[01:43:00]  But that's a bad copy.  It's in July.  Of course it's every July.  There's too much directing around here.  Norway.  Fish fingers in Norway.  Finders, Norway.  We know a certain fjord in Norway.  Near where the cod gather in great shoals.  There, Janst, Stangeland.  Shit.  A fraction more on that shoals thing.  Because you roll it around very nicely.  Yeah, roll it around and I have no more time.  You don't know what I'm up against.  Because it's full of things that are only correct because they're grammatical. 
[01:43:30]  But they're tough on the ear.  You see?  This is a very wearying one.  It's unpleasant to read.  Unrewarding.  Because Findus frees the cod at sea.  And then add a crumb crisp.  Cool crumb crisp coating.  Ah, that's tough.  Crumb crisp coating.  I think, no, because of the way it's written.  You need to break it up.  Because it's not, it's not as conversationally written. 
[01:44:00]  What?  Take crumb out.  Take crumb out.  Good.  Here under protest is Beef Burgers.  We know a little place in the American Far West  where Charlie Briggs chops up the finest prairie-fed beef and tastes.  This is a lot of shit.  You know that.  You want one more?  More on what beef?  You missed the first beef, actually, completely.  What do you mean, missed it?  You're emphasizing prairie-fed.  But you can't emphasize beef. 
[01:44:30]  That's like he's wanting me to emphasize in before July.  Come on, fellas.  You're losing your heads.  I wouldn't direct any living actor like this in Shakespeare.  Will you do this?  It's impossible.  Orson, you did six last year, and by far and away the best.  And I know the reason.  The right reading for this is the one I'm giving it.  At the moment.  I spend 20 times more for you people than any other commercial I've ever made.  You are such pests.  Now, what is it you want?  In your depths of your ignorance, what is it you want? 
[01:45:00]  Whatever it is you want, I can't deliver it because I just don't see it.  That was absolutely fine.  It really was.  You should be worth it.  No money is worth it.  Like sand through the hourglass, so is the O&A virus.  What do you guys think of the new pope?  He's your grandfather.  He's someone's old grandfather that wears the pope uniform.  He doesn't understand anything new.  They try to make it sound like he was a new kind of modern guy because it's like, 
[01:45:30]  he even has a fan site on the internet.  Do you think this guy has a clue what the internet is?  Do you think he has a clue what computers are that people have them in their home,  that it opens up information to people around the world?  What kind of fan site could he have?  What kind of nerds belong to this?  I know.  Oh, I'm going to go to the Cardinals fan site.  I'll talk to you later.  I want to post.  You know, his blessing today kind of sucked.  The first hour of his blessing was kind of cool, but then it was downhill from there. 
[01:46:00]  I think the pope's losing it.  Yeah.  The pope used to be hilarious, but now he just sucks.  He's always bitching about the Vatican and how nothing works around the Vatican.  I just want the pope to get back to blessing stuff instead of bitching about what the Vatican is.  Oh, God.  Is the pope going to turn down the Catholic?  Oh!  Thank you.  I saw in your eyes, too, you had so much confidence. 
[01:46:30]  Damn it!  I knew it was going to be good.  I would say tone down.  Yeah, the pope's toning down his sermons.  I think the Vatican's getting on him.  You know, the pope used to have balls, and he said what he meant.  I hate when he always has that one cardinal, and he wrecks the flow.  Fucking assholes.  The old pope was so much funnier. 
[01:47:00]  The old pope.  I used to love listening to him.  This new pope stinks.  I think he's failing.  This guy's just a John Paul clone.  Oh, Christ.  Well, you know, us here on PopeBag.com.  What a day. 
[01:47:30]  What a day.  What a day.  In studio, Bill Burr.  Old friend.  Haven't seen him in a while.  Sorry, Bill.  There's so much going on.  Way back in February.  That's not true.  I've known you for a few years now.  Oh, that's true.  Off and on, going down in the cellar to see Jim Noren.  We all sit at that back table and try to out-funny each other.  We all laugh.  And I'm always the worst. 
[01:48:00]  But I hang in there.  Elbow each other in the ribs.  Yeah, I give it a good shot.  Mary Carey's here, Anthony, the porn star, with another very, very hot blonde.  And she's in the news because she got arrested for touching herself in a strip club.  At a strip club.  Ooh.  Wow.  That's outrageous.  So we'll talk to her in a few minutes.  And Tibby Tom and Gray Wolf are going to come in here and do the news in a few minutes.  Tibby Tom's thinking of the...  Oh, my God.  He's scratching.  Always scratching.  That is the itchiest guy ever.  Bill.  I'm saying you can't have him do, like, a remote. 
[01:48:30]  Yeah, put the mic out there.  It's his radio.  Do you really need him in here?  I think we got to...  You know, I think we need him in here.  Yes.  I demand...  Because you got to see what happens when he comes in here.  Dude, I knew something...  Anthony goes into defense mode.  I knew something awful was going to happen.  I come in here.  There's three candles already lit.  Candles.  Yeah.  Bill's like...  Which one are you giving me, Jimmy?  Can you pass, Anthony, ooh, dreamsicle.  Ooh, I like the dreamsicle.  Watch out.  Hot wax coming through.  Don't spill any on yourself, Bill.  Hot wax.  Yeah, Bill...  Don't you want it surrounding the homeless guy? 
[01:49:00]  No, you kind of want it in different sectors.  Yeah, he's putting up a wall.  Ninny muggins.  Oh, you guys are experienced with this.  I have a very cinnamon toast.  Let me explain something to you, Bill.  That guy right there is not only homeless.  He's gay.  And he has AIDS.  That's the ninja.  And we're not really sure, but we think he has a really bad case of lice, because he's  been itching his head really, really hard all morning.  The last time we was in here, he was sitting in that exact chair.  He fell asleep to the point. 
[01:49:30]  I'm not lying to you.  All three of us, including Keith, the cop who brought him in, all thought he died.  Thought he was dead.  Thought we could not wake him up.  He would not wake up.  And then Keith goes to see if he had a pulse.  Couldn't find a pulse on the guy.  Let's go back to the lice.  Is that like jump off of him?  You kind of shut down after the lice.  Yeah, I don't know if they're, you know, jumping lice.  Lice jump?  How do they get from one head to one head?  There's something going on.  Yeah, how else do they get on the people?  They go from dogs to people all the time.  Yeah, but I think lice go from dogs to people? 
[01:50:00]  Or any hair to hair.  Please jump.  Well, yeah, but sort of lice.  Well, I think lice, you need some kind of contact.  Yeah, I think so.  What about like clothing or hats or something?  No, no, no.  You say somebody has body lice, does that just mean it's in like your pubes?  Yeah, your chest hair.  It's not like crawling up your arm or anything, is it?  Might be.  I don't know.  I don't know.  We know he's just itching really, really hard, and then he brushes off his shirt,  so something's coming out of his hair.  The reason they nest in your pubes, they'll nest in the pubes because it's warm.  But they'll also crawl in your chest hair or anything.  You have a look of glee on your face. 
[01:50:30]  Yeah.  Because I have no hair.  They're warm.  Lice, laugh at me.  Warm, smelly pubes.  That's right.  Right to the guinea across the console.  That's where they go.  Right to Anthony.  Lice jump on you and realize it's an ice rink.  Yeah.  Like, oh, fuck.  Got to find somebody else.  Got to go find a forest.  All right.  You got to get him naked, too.  Bill's got to see him naked.  Oh, God.  No.  Damn it.  You have to.  I understand.  I love you guys, but I want to maintain a certain level of innocence. 
[01:51:00]  Right.  Bill, you have to see him naked.  No.  You have to join the fraternity.  No.  Dude, you've got to see his underwear.  Golden buns.  No.  First of all, his underwear is now gray.  He got naked and yelled and screamed last time because he wanted to strip it for all  of us on the stage, which is this little thing in front of us.  Called the console of the stage.  And I can't deal with this kind of stuff.  I'm not even joking.  Oh, you're one of those guys, too?  I can't eat on.  You know who I don't?  I can't.  That dude who hangs out down the cellar.  Oh, Mike?  Yeah.  It was kind of like the mascot guy. 
[01:51:30]  Every time I sit down to eat, he comes up and he starts itching his hair.  Yeah.  And you just know shit is flying out of it into your cellar.  So you're like Anthony.  I can't take it.  Filthy people.  See, I like trainers.  Yeah, I don't like a guy with caked on shit.  Yeah.  Caked shit in his ass.  Go figure.  I don't really like him in the same room.  Mike in the cellar is not as bad as Tom.  Mike's like messed up from drugs in the 60s, but he's fairly coherent and a little wacky.  This guy's frightening.  This guy's frightening.  He touches everything.  He does.  They treat him like he's like this cat.  Like it's cute or something. 
[01:52:00]  Like it's cute.  This guy dropped his pants and his underwear had just caked on crap.  Oh, God.  Awful.  I love saying stuff like that to get reactions from people.  It just makes my day.  I'm seeing where the comedy's going to be.  You sit with the other girl over there.  I'll take care of the situation here.  Yeah, the real men over here can handle great caked on shit.  Bruce Kelly wants to say hi, Anthony.  He's been calling all morning.  Bruce Kelly.  Hi, boys.  How you doing?  Bruce.  Very good, Bruce. 
[01:52:30]  Hi, Jimmy.  Hi, Bill.  Hi, Bruce.  How are you?  Doing fine.  Thanks for giving me a second.  And, first of all, quit blaming me for the shitty production on The Worst Of While You  Were Gone, okay?  We were blaming you.  We were actually saying thank you for spending the time and actually putting it together.  Yeah, that's exactly what we said.  Yeah, but it was goofy.  I heard the replays.  I don't produce anything.  I just voice stuff.  You know that.  And I was, you know, we're trying to back you down here.  Now, get out of that. 
[01:53:00]  Are you yelling at us?  Are you yelling at us?  You're yelling at us.  You sound like you're better suited for management.  By God.  We're trying to help you here, and we got nothing but guff.  Don't bite the hand that feeds you.  Here's the deal.  I hear it in Anthony's voice.  You guys get away from FM radio to stop taking the shit.  Now you're right back in it again.  And we talked about this.  At least Ben and Eric and I talked about this when I was up there doing the taping.  You guys have no pit bull for the show.  You have nobody down here. 
[01:53:30]  I just want to go fucking crazy with you.  Pardon me?  No, you're right.  You have no pit bull for the show.  It's in the radio show.  Quiet.  You work for a Hollywood studio now.  Quiet.  That's what the structure is.  Quiet.  Stop it.  Stop whining.  You know, all kidding aside, I actually do agree that we do need somebody down there really 
[01:54:00]  fighting.  Stop whining.  Stop whining.  Stop it.  Kill the 360.  You got nobody down here screaming for you.  Well, I think we're working on that there, Bruce.  Yeah.  Well, I know you don't give a shit what I think, but you know what?  There are some...  Quiet.  We definitely care.  You've been in the business a very long time.  You do your own morning show on the 80s. 
[01:54:30]  Look, look, look.  Don't make me out to be Mark Perrano, okay?  Thanks.  But you got somebody supporting you guys.  Stop whining.  Stop whining.  Stop.  Stop.  Quiet.  Quiet.  Quiet.  Quiet.  You got a lot of people down here that wanted to succeed.  Quiet.  After all, we're all into the company.  Quiet.  Quiet.  Quiet.  Quiet.  No, Jesus.  You know.  But the bottom line is it is a little bit easier if somebody is down there who knows  the system and who is kind of... 
[01:55:00]  Like, if there's a problem, you know where to go, what offices to walk right into as opposed  to 50 emails being sent.  I think I'm hearing, Bruce, you want to be our good.  Go-to guy in Washington.  Well, you know, you need somebody that understands the show.  And you need somebody that understands this stupid politics.  You've got to play.  Well, no shit.  And it's not ELO.  It ain't ELO.  ELO signs things.  Yeah, here's the deal, Bruce. 
[01:55:30]  Let me explain something to you.  Okay.  Go ahead.  We don't really care if anyone supports us down there.  What?  Well, you know...  I care.  Why?  I don't know.  Support is fun.  It would be nice.  That's what's going to make it work, though, guys.  Because you are a disgusting fat body, brother Kyle!  Well, any fucking time, sweetheart!  Bruce, do you think that one of the problems is that, like, a lot of the time is because  of the technical issues, there was never, like, really that one place that, you know, anything 
[01:56:00]  could kind of just come from?  You never should have had the technical issues.  They never should have been there.  What?  What?  You mean all the fucked up stuff with the studio?  Yeah, but also because I wasn't too sure if, like, the stuff that was supposed to be  going through Gillette wasn't...  What?  Bruce, here's the deal.  Yeah, go ahead.  We don't really need the support of Washington.  Anthony and I have been very successful without anyone supporting us.  But I'm not doubting that.  It would probably be easier if someone supported the show and fought for us, but we'll be successful 
[01:56:30]  either way.  That's unquestionable.  All right.  Unquestionable.  Now you're talking, Bruce.  Now we're on the same page.  Unquestionable.  But a lot of people don't, you know, shit.  You know, it's hard for me to talk to really...  You like to square your ass away and start shitting me, Tiffany Cufflicks.  Oh, I will definitely fuck you up.  ...to really start letting it fly, and I've got kids to support.  Don't pull my fucking hand over there.  I said joke yourself.  Now joke yourself. 
[01:57:00]  Bruce, don't you have a record to play?  No, man.  It's Aureo Speedwagon, and I don't care.  Do you...  Bruce?  Yeah, yeah.  Hold on.  We're going to...  Doug Out Doug is going to talk for all listeners, I do believe, from BlackBag.com.  Doug Out Doug, all right.  Doug, you're on with Bruce Kelly, who does the morning show on the 80s channel.  Let me have it.  All right.  Let me have it.  Morning.  Morning.  Morning.  How are we all doing? 
[01:57:30]  Pretty good.  First, let me just say, I won't even turn on the 80s channel anymore, because I'm fearing  I'm going to hear your voice, and it's going to shred through my skull.  Thank you.  I'm going to say something like interlocular, and it makes me want to murder a family of  small children.  I didn't make that up.  I read it.  Yeah, but you're like Man Cow.  All these people not taking responsibility for what they're doing.  Don't bring up Man Cow.  Come on.  You could have said, this stinks, and not done it.  There was a couple of really funny ones, though, I thought.  Yeah, there was that one where you... 
[01:58:00]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  No, no, no, no, no, no.  There was the thing with the change.  Yeah, I was down there in D.C., and there was that...  Yeah, yeah.  Remember the change one?  Well, no, I'm sure we could come up with one good one.  Yeah, I'll sit here and wait until you do.  There was the...  There was actually a few good ones, dude.  The change one was good.  Yeah, name one.  The change...  The one with the change noise?  You know, for some strange reason, I enjoy this.  You took a cool word and little theme of the show, like the virus, and turned it into  a horrible tagline. 
[01:58:30]  All right, man.  Bruce, I fucking hate you so much, it's not even funny.  I want your children to go for a ride with Susan Smith.  You are a vile, horrible man that took six months of great radio and turned it into morning  zoo bullshit.  Never did the morning zoo.  You know what?  This is what I love about this show.  I like this show, too.  Bruce, you know, it's so weird.  We're still having technical problems with the phone. 
[01:59:00]  I would have hung up on this guy.  Pardon me?  We're having technical problems with the phone, or I would have hung up on this guy already.  Yeah, okay.  An aborted fetus would represent them ten times better in Washington than you ever could.  Thanks, Jim.  His name's Doug.  Doug, yeah.  That's Doug Out Doug from Whackbag.com.  Okay.  Good to meet you.  I'm sorry.  I'm sorry.  Do I hate you with the passion and violence that Jimmy hates the world?  I'm sorry.  You did it to yourself, though, you piece of shit.  I'm very proud of it. 
[01:59:30]  All right.  Thank you.  Well, that's just one of those random callers.  Let's go to Anthony in Jersey.  Anthony?  Hey, I want to tell you how much I really, really thoroughly enjoyed you for those two weeks.  The best of, Opie and Anthony.  But.  No but.  Dude, this was a supporter.  Well, thank you very much.  That's, you know.  Not you. 
[02:00:00]  I couldn't warm up to you if we were cremated together.  That was the worst thing I've ever heard.  I was going to kill myself.  I agree.  Okay.  I'm a douchebag Rick Dees.  All right?  I get it.  Well, no.  No, I get it.  Go ahead.  Go ahead.  Say it.  No, no.  Here's the deal.  Here's the deal, Bruce.  Say it.  Go ahead.  You know how radio goes.  We bounce it out.  I mean, we can't leave without one positive call. 
[02:00:30]  So let's go to Kevin in Brooklyn.  Kevin?  Hey, guys.  Hey.  Hi, Kev.  You did a really good job.  Can you sing the Opie and Anthony theme that you sang?  God.  What was that one again?  Oh, you know.  Do we have that arc?  Actually, I think that was your shining moment.  Yeah, that was a good one.  All right.  Just fucking kill me then.  Huh?  Just shoot me.  Wait.  What was the...  Huh?  Well, we're going to try to find it.  Yeah.  We don't know which one it is, though.  Get the praise.  And we definitely don't want to go through all of them.  I don't know.  There were some funny ones in there, man. 
[02:01:00]  Oh, no, no, no.  I think they just busted your balls.  There were actually some funny ones.  No, I did.  Jim.  It was one of the longer ones, Eric.  I get the show.  Huh?  Yeah, you get the show, and that's why you want to...  Give us the big pitch here.  Got it.  Oh, wait.  Here's the O&A song that Bruce Kelly came up with.  This was the shining moment of all the production he did while we were on vacation.  The virus is now free.  Yeah, sure.  I know the Opie and Anthony theme song.  One, two, three.  Opie. 
[02:01:30]  Anthony.  The guy Jim.  Opie.  Anthony.  The guy Jim.  With the torture.  Opie.  God damn it.  Are you fucking with me?  What's the problem?  It's better than Green Acres.  By the way, you know...  By the way, you know, when you're telling these little stories, here's a good idea.  Have a point. 
[02:02:00]  It makes it so much more interesting for the listener.  They were outtakes.  Give me that something to say.  Psst.  And I know that's real.  Jimmy lets his ass do the talking.  Wait, let me do my spiel.  Well, Bruce, you know, with the...  I want to hear his spiel.  You might have a good pitch.  With entertainment like that, I really believe you should be playing less records and talking  on your morning show on the 80s channel.  No, that's not the point.  That's not...  I liked his interview with Frenchy.  That's...  Oh. 
[02:02:30]  We got to learn when Frenchy gets up for work and goes to bed.  Yeah, that was wonderful.  All right.  Bruce is going to make his pitch because we will be hiring some guy to be our pit bull  in Washington.  That is true.  Yeah, well, you need the pit bull.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Hold on.  All right.  Go ahead, Bruce.  Go ahead.  You need the pit bull.  You need somebody who is not only into the show, you need the pit bull.  You not only need the guy that's into the show, but that can stare down Mr. Huge De Niro 
[02:03:00]  and tell him what the...  Huge De Niro.  Pardon me?  Big money.  Yeah.  And tell him exactly what the...  Bruce just...  No uncertain term.  Bruce, just walk away.  The Kajigugu record awaits.  Bruce, just walk away.  Please, save me, guys.  Just walk away, Bruce.  Please, God save me.  Yeah, just put the phone down.  Don't even hang it up.  We just want to hear you walking away.  You want to hear that door close behind you.  Yeah. 
[02:03:30]  There he goes.  There goes Bruce Kelly, everyone.  Hopefully the next sound we'll hear is a shotgun.  That's right.  There he goes, Bruce Kelly.  I see the awful, terrible things in my life and turn it into something funny.  Back to the 80s channel.  Put on Billie Jean and do your Bud Dwyer impression. 
[02:04:00]  This is Bruce Kelly on the 80s channel.  Good morning to ya.  Here's Kajigugu, too shy.  Having a graduation weekend.  The year 1985.  You might remember this one.  Playing at your prom.  It's Kajigugu.  On XM 80s. 
[02:04:30]  Bruce Kelly here.  Going to sing a little of the Opie and Anthony song.  Opie.  Anthony.  Da, da, da, da.  The guy Jim.  Opie.  Anthony.  Now let me sound like it's improv.  The guy Jim.  Alright, enough of that crap.  Well, he is right, though.  We are hiring a pit bull.  We are?  Yeah, but he's more like a collie. 
[02:05:00]  A cute collie.  Who?  Well, he's not that cute.  He's a little midget collie.  Like a midget collie?  No, he's a midget collie.  You ever seen those ones?  Yeah.  It's like a collie, but they've got really short legs.  Running around.  No, he's not a midget.  He's...  Is that you're just farting over there?  Yeah, he's trying to freshen the room up before we bring Tippi Tom back in.  He's testing the candles.  He's testing the candles.  Very good.  Alright, why don't we do some news?  Why are these guys picking their fingernails and stuff before they come in here? 
[02:05:30]  Tippi Tom has his arms stuck under his armpit, which must just...  It's got to be just some nuclear...  I think he pulls his hand out and he's got no fingers left.  Set up for the newscast.  He's got nice sunglasses, though.  It's kind of odd.  How do you keep those?  With the rest of the ensemble.  Alright, here we go.  We're waking up Tippi Tom.  Oh, boy.  Oh, he is asleep again.  And Grey Wolf is doing his nails.  Keith the cop is putting on the surgical gloves to wake him up with.  The hazard...  Purple latex.  Purple latex. 
[02:06:00]  Alright, Tom.  We have woken up Tippi Tom.  Where's the mic out there?  We should have a mic out there, man.  Yeah, get the mic.  Because no one...  No remote mic or no?  I think he's massaging his right breast.  I don't know that it...  We really should...  It's just obvious that we should have a mic out there when this is going on.  That's all, guys.  I don't want to yell and scream, but that's what should happen, right?  When you're waking up with Tippi Tom, you definitely should have a mic.  Alright, Tippi Tom is itching his shoulder before he leaves his seat.  I don't know where...  That's how he talks. 
[02:06:30]  Bill, are you going to be freaked out?  Going to be.  I'm just trying to think how many times he's been woken up in his life and told he had to move.  He's probably even a flashback.  There is not another spare mic around here that could be used.  You have to actually remove a microphone from one of the mic booms here in the studio.  By the time they get the remote mic set up...  He's going to be in here.  He's going to be in here.  Well, then they could...  Alright, Eric.  Alright, well.  He's probably going to have morning breath.  Oof.  Alright, Grey Wolf's in studio.  Hey, Grey. 
[02:07:00]  You've got to hear this guy's voice there, Bill.  He's got to get a booming radio voice.  Listen to this guy.  I can't smell it.  Listen to this guy.  The gorgeous voice in the world.  And only not that Wolfman Jack will be turning in his grave because of my voice.  But this is natural.  It's not that I'm making it up or anything like that.  We both had that.  See, we have Tippi Tom as our anchor for the news today.  Okay.  I'm the co-anchor.  Alright, hold on.  We're waiting on Tippi Toad to start us off. 
[02:07:30]  If you need to, like, you just spray the Lysol into the foam on your mic.  And then you put your nose right against it.  It'll help you out.  I feel like one of the guys that's been in the nom for a while.  Teaching the young kid.  I'm just going to keep...  Ladies and gentlemen, it's the all audience of Ovi and Anthony, which is the most greatest  show on this planet.  Well, thank you.  We're going to have Tippi Toad Tommy give us the news.  Hey, Tom.  You want to...  I don't know how long I have.  Hey, Tippi Tom.  Focus.  Focus.  Focus.  Me and you, bro. 
[02:08:00]  Me and you.  Alright, you want to do the news naked or you want to do it with all your clothes on?  Okay, it says Michael Jackson.  Hold on, hold on, hold on.  20 bucks to get naked.  20 bucks.  What I'm saying is that...  It just hit you, right?  Tippi Tom and Grey Wolf.  Dude, it's so bad.  That's me, the co-anchor.  Right?  Alright, hold on.  Alright, you got to pay...  See, I have first billing.  You got to pay attention.  Now, you want to hear the news.  20 bucks to get naked.  Alright, hold on.  There's a lot going...  Hold on.  Okay. 
[02:08:30]  Hold on.  Is that Chris Christophers?  Anthony's talking over here with Bill Burr.  What's going on?  I was just telling Bill how to best live through this scent that's filling the room.  I have a paper towel, which I have sprayed Lysol into.  I'm smelling that.  I'm manning up.  It's really kind of...  You're manning up?  Alright.  Wow, Bill.  It's not that bad, right, Jimmy?  It's fine.  Tom's fine.  I want to see him naked.  Yeah, Tom, you want to get naked?  Of course.  Yes!  Yes!  That's what I've been trying to tell everybody.  Alright, you better get naked for the news. 
[02:09:00]  Because my body is in good shape.  Tommy, let's...  Yes, yes, yes.  Thank you.  Jimmy, Tom, 20 bucks if you get naked to do the news.  20 bucks.  I'll do it with two dollars.  I'll give you 30 to keep your clothes on.  30 bucks if you keep your clothes on.  Come on, Tom.  35 if you take it off and not putting it up there.  No, 40 bucks to keep it on, right?  Tom, here's a quick 15 so far.  Alright, let's get better here.  I see some money right here.  You guys start taking your clothes off. 
[02:09:30]  I'll give you 40 to keep them on.  Bill, I'm going to turn your mic off in a second.  You've got 30 for keeping them on.  Which one do you want?  No, $15.  Come on, take your clothes off.  You get the money.  You're not taking it or no?  Come on, man.  Do the math.  Do the math.  Hang on to the homeless guy.  $15 to take your clothes off.  Alright, you can...  You're lying.  Take your shirt off and then you get the $15.  $15 to take that shirt off.  I'll give you the $15 to keep it on.  $16 to keep it on.  Alright, come on.  $15 to take your shirt off.  $15?  But you've got $30 to keep it on.  No, he's not going to get money.  No, no, no. 
[02:10:00]  Wolf, do the math, man.  This guy is just messing with him.  I'm shaking money in front of my face here.  There you go.  Come on, take your shirt off.  Where is it at?  Give me that money.  I knew it was a lie.  No, you have to take the shirt off and then the money comes.  No, I don't know where to see this body.  Why?  It's gold.  Why?  That's a gold.  Whoa!  Jesus, don't think you are cruel.  You are fucking cruel, man.  Tom, he keeps leaning over with the money in his hand.  And when Tom goes to gravity, he pulls the bag.  Watch, watch, watch.  Whoa!  That's a scumbag. 
[02:10:30]  How about just down to your underwear?  You are a scumbag.  How about just down to your underwear, Tibby Tom?  $15.  Just down to the underwear.  Drop your drawers.  Jim, help me out, because if I set up money over here, then I'll take my pants off.  Okay, here's 20 to take your pants off.  Will you do it?  How about we give him $40.86 to keep him on?  Tibby Tom.  The other guy's in the car.  Wait, wait, wait.  Tibby Tom, do you trust Gray Wolf with all money?  You ain't paying me more.  Here we go.  I'm going to keep my pants off.  Gray Wolf.  No.  Gray Wolf, here's the money. 
[02:11:00]  Gray Wolf.  I'm handing it to Gray Wolf, but he doesn't hand it to you until you get, he's Native American.  I will not give it to you if you don't give it to me.  You want his, you don't want to see his body.  We have 15 for your shirt.  That's sad.  The white man took our land music.  Yeah, he had a food in there earlier.  Are you serious?  Yes, we're serious.  Go ahead.  You guys must make a lot of money.  Do you need some music?  You don't have to take off.  Thank God the police department's in.  Look at the color of those underwear. 
[02:11:30]  They used to be white.  Those used to be white underwear.  Come on.  No, Tom, you can keep your...  No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.  No, no, no, no, no, no, no.  Don't be a cock walker.  The shirt first.  The shirt first.  No, no, no.  I was hoping he would keep his underpants on.  No, you're not.  I'm not.  All right.  You have 35 dollars.  Come on, you've got to walk the crowd here.  Take it all off.  You don't go straight to the ball.  No.  I don't want to sing.  Tip B.  Tip B.  Tip B.  He's dancing.  There he goes.

Another chance.  Okay.  The pants go down.  The pants is 20 bucks.  The shirt is 15.  That's right.  I don't want nobody to see my body. 
[02:12:30]  Come on.  I'll help you.  Tippi, what's wrong with Tippi?  I'm getting a percentage.  What's wrong with your chest?  I am your producer.  I get 10%.  You got bugs, he just said.  Great Wolf.  Here you go.  Take my money back.  I got bugs.  All right.  Oh, God.  He got bugs.  I got him.  He got a bug.  Here we go.  Tippi, what kind of bug you got?  What kind of bugs?

[02:13:00]  Oh, that is cute.  Oh, God damn it.  That wasn't enough.  We didn't see the golden buns.  We got to see the buns.  Look at the open.  Oh, there's your golden buns.  You got to see the golden buns.  Oh, my boo.  Oh, my.  Oh, my.  Oh, my.  I don't look as good as that.  Nice.  Very nice.  Oh, God.  It looks like he has chicken pox.  That's enough.  Nice.  Did he earn it?  Did he earn it?  Yes, he did. 
[02:13:30]  Yes, he did.  Very nice.  Oh, there you go.  Five dollars.  Very, very nice.  You see how nice it is.  I'll do this every day.  That's hot.  That's from all those years.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Over there.  Eric.  Eric.  You've really got Eric.  Eric.  Over there.  Over there.  Over there.  Over there.  Over there.  Over there.  All right.  What were you guys saying?  That's from all those years sleeping on gravel.  Yeah.  It just put, like, marks in a permanent puff.  Holy Jesus.  It looks like he has chicken pox.  Dude, he is a mess.  No, no.  Just little bug bites. 
[02:14:00]  That's all.  Little bug bites.  Little bug bites.  He's got bug bites all over him.  But sheets have held up very well, though.  You've got to be honest.  She's very solid.  Oh, good God.  I want to smack one.  Oh, a little spank.  All right.  A little crap on your hand?  All right.  Are you guys ready for the news with Chippy Tom?  I want to spank the whole.  No.  All right, listen.  Hold on.  Graywolf, you're going to help with the news?  Who made this?  Don't worry about it.  Have you got the news?  Wacky guys who came up with this material.  I got the news.  I mean, I love it.  I read it.  How would you all respect me? 
[02:14:30]  Put your glasses on.  We have to explain to him why he's reading the news.  Washington.  All right, hold on.  Hold on.  Hold on.  A while ago, during one of our very creative and constructive meetings in Washington,  the upper echelon, the brass, if you will, at XM, decided the Opie and Anthony show needed  a news person.  Because we can discuss the news, but it's better if somebody else does it and we comment  on it.  Right.  You know?  So they said we needed a news person.  So we've been auditioning news people over the past few months. 
[02:15:00]  Yeah.  We've had people just coming off the street.  We've had Dee Dee from the complex down there in Washington.  We've had plenty of people.  And Tippi Tom is just one more person that will now audition to be the newsreader on the  Opie and Anthony.  Good luck, Tom.  Good luck, Tom.  All right.  We think you have what it takes.  Thank you for making me feel special.  All right.  Jimmy, where are you going?  You are special.  Because, you know, I don't feel special.  Where did Jimmy go?  Here we go.  But you make me feel special.  Oh, yeah. 
[02:15:30]  Here we go.  Remember that show, The CB Bears?  Tippi Tom.  You're the anchor man.  Tippi Tom.  I don't know.  We'll play full anchor.  Okay.  Here we go.  Here we go.  Where's Jane Fonda at?  I'll read the top first.  Michael Jackson, where he's at?  Right here.  He ain't showing up.  Dig it.  Yeah, yeah.  Hoo-wah.  You need a little help?  Hoo-wah.  He'll box you 20 bucks if you want me to help you.  Michael Jackson knew. 
[02:16:00]  Yeah.  All right, let's go.  Michael Jackson's trial continues.  What the hell's your trial for?  Eric's going to be confused.  Eric's going to be confused.  That's what you get for not being a fool.  He molested me.  Hey, Tippi Tom.  Yes, sir.  Would you hug him?  Yeah, can you hug him?  Yes, let me hug him.  Oh, God damn it.  I'm going to hug you.  No, I'm going to hug him.  Just give him a hug.  Just give him a hug, Tom.  I'm going to hug him.  Oh, God, you suck.  You are so fucking evil, man. 
[02:16:30]  What is he?  He's a person.  Yeah, he's a person, too.  He needs sugar beans.  I give him beans.  I'm not Frankenstein.  Tippi Tom, focus, focus.  Just give Eric a little tussle.  They're both better looking to me anyway.  Just hold his hand.  That's why they don't want to hug me.  You're better looking to me, too.  All right.  All right.  I'll read the news.  Yeah, let's read the news.  Yeah, Michael Jackson's on trial there, Tippi Tom.  Let's go.  Okay, he says, Michael Jackson's trial continues in California. 
[02:17:00]  I'm only clunking.  Something that Jackson reportedly sells his summary catalog to pay legal fees.  The hell's wrong with that?  All right.  What's the story there, Tom?  I'm going to try to do this like it's legit.  His Sony catalog to pay legal fees.  You didn't know what a Sony catalog stands for.  What does it stand for, Graywolf?  Graywolf, get in there. 
[02:17:30]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  It's about going to K-Mark's and finding little children's underwears half off.  I think someone's doing a writing before they got here.  That's the real right.  Look, it reads like this.  Yeah, go ahead, Wolf.  Michael Jackson's trial continues in California.  Macaulay Culkin will testify in the case.  Jackson to reportedly sell his Sony catalog to pay for legal fees. 
[02:18:00]  In other words, he's broke.  Oh, my God, that is so terrible.  He broke.  I can't believe he did this.  He can't do the moon dance with his golden buns.  Give us the moon dance.  Yeah.  Give us the moon dance, Tippi.  Yeah.  Do a little moon dance.  You got to show golden buns and walk back.  Well.  Whoa, hey.  You want to close on or off?  Off.  Off.  Of course.  Off.  That's not him.  All right.  Stand back.  Opie.  Opie.  Oh.  If you notice, that's not him actually moonwalking. 
[02:18:30]  It's the bugs carrying him backwards.  It's the moonwalking.  Oh, God.  Oh, my God.  You know, I'm TV-TVs so bad right now.  I'll scare you.  How much do you wear the underwear over your face for one minute?  What's Jay Fonda do now?  Phil, 20 bucks.  All right.  Let's go back to me.  All right.  Hold on.  Back to the news.  He's on a book tour for a new book.  My life so far.  Oh, my God.  Yeah.  Jay Fonda book tour. 
[02:19:00]  Her life's far away.  Over there.  Over there.  Okay.  Move him over.  Wait on, Bob.  Yeah.  Go over a little bit because the guy was here yesterday.  I can't.  I can't.  Is that a smell horrendous?  Come on, man.  Dirty pages.  Hold it.  I'm trying to get through this.  The pages are dirty where he's holding it.  All right.  Listen.  Listen.  Come on.  Let's get back to this.  Vietnam.  All right.  Wait.  TV, start over.  Min Lapisade.  Great wolf.  Start him over.  Start him over.  Min Lapisade.  Like this.  Look.  You read it like this.  Min Lapisade.  This is how you read it. 
[02:19:30]  Look.  Jane Fonda is.  Jane Fonda is.  It looks like you've got a manicure with licorice.  Come on.  You're ready.  You're not kidding.  Jane Fonda.  You got my glasses.  Listen.  Listen.  Jane Fonda is on a book tour for her new book.  My life so far.  It's split between a Vietnam vet and nipple.  And what?  Nipple.  And nipple analyst.  What the fuck?  You're talking about.  The whole other language.  You have to show your nipples.  Not in Utah. 
[02:20:00]  That's what I thought.  That's true.  And then now the weather.  No, no, no.  We only have two stories for him?  I got to do the weather.  This is mine.  Oh, you're doing the weather?  The weather is mine.  This is too good.  Here goes.  I am the co-anchor, great wolf.  And the weather belongs to me.  It says, weather today is great.  Just like me.  Woo!  In Indiana.  Partly cloudy.  With highs of 57 degrees.  And lows of 43 degrees.  Tomorrow, showers. 
[02:20:30]  That way you can get one.  Oh, he can take a shower in the cowards.  49 degrees.  Next stage is Tommy.  All right.  Back to Tommy.  All right.  Well, I read.  It'll be.  Where's my glasses at?  Right behind your hair.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I can't.  All right.  Yeah.  I see better now.  I'll read the part.  All right.  Here we go.  Tippi Thomas.  Okay.  In entertainment.

What about the...  I know how to read.  Yeah, but what about...  There's some great...  Tippi Tom knows how to read.  There's some great stories today.  We got the teacher arrested for having sex with one of her students.  Dude, we got to get him to talk about this stuff, man.  Oh, my God.  I wish I was the student.  Huh?  I wish I was the student. 
[02:22:00]  How many news stories did they give him?  Two?  Yeah.  There's some good ones.  What about the Megaminey guy?  But they didn't get back there and write it.  More people, man.  If you're going to do the news.  We're going to go write some more news.  Ben.  They were having a very tough time with the news.  Those were the easiest stories for them to read.  It's not about being easy, though.  It's about just giving them stuff to talk about.  Shaq is now Squish.  And he's always happy to be here.  He calls Shaq Squish?  I like Tippi Tom's sweatshirt slash hanky. 
[02:22:30]  Flash panky, too.  No, no.  Hanky is what he's using on his nose to keep the stench from what's coming off of your body.  What happens to your body?  He used to be like Rob Stewart.  If you like my body, go ahead and do it.  Come on, think I'm sexy.  I can still do it.  All right.  Let's do it.  Go ahead, Tom.  Don't you know?  Sing some Rod Stewart.  That's it.

If you want my body and you think I'm sexy, come on, baby, let me know.  But you got to...  Come on.  Don't you know I'm lonely?  Don't you know I'm lonely?  Don't you know I need a Sony radio?  He's got a good voice.  Yeah.  No more Rod Stewart for you. 
[02:23:30]  How about one of Tony Bennett?  But a man loves a woman.  How about that?  I left my heart in San Francisco.  Go ahead, go ahead, go ahead, go ahead.  High on a hill, it calls to me, little cable cars, they take me to the start. 
[02:24:00]  And that is the walk.  And blah, blah, blah, blah.  There you go.  Yeah, little little bang.  We're up in the Sierra Mountain Champagne Champagne Cockpit.  We haven't been able to stump him yet.  Pick a song, we haven't been able to stump him yet.  Oh, he is pretty good.  All right, hey, Tom, Frank Sinatra, let's go.  All right, all right, all right.  New York, New York.  Well, start spreading the news.  Oh, yeah.

[02:25:00]  You know any U2, Tippi Tom?  Tippi Tom, you know any U2?  Oh, yeah.  You do.  I think we got it.  I might, I might, I might, I might, I might.  How about underwear?  Filthy underwear.  Oh, the song, Funky Underwear?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  That's a good one, actually.  That's a really good one.  That was a big hit.  Now you can't remember the words.  You know Sunday, Bloody Sunday?  In the name of love?  A lot of people are saying he sounds like Al Pacino, by the way. 
[02:25:30]  There are some things I do not know.  Yeah?  He does.  I didn't hear you say that.  Oh, Opie.  There's so much going on at the same time here today.  How about some Aerosmith?  Train keep it rolling on that long hat.  Hey.  Nah.  Love in the yellow.  Hang on.  Jesus.  He starts off.  Love on the yellow.  Dude, he starts off every song really good.  Yeah.  It's just real strong.  That's all he needs to know.  He just has to sing until people walk by.  Yeah, that's true.  That's so true.  All right, go ahead.  One more time there. 
[02:26:00]  Well, I'm kind of like shut out for words right now unless I get some help from my audience.  There you go.  Work the room.  Work the room.  Well, yeah, my audience up here.  I sort of need a little help from my friends.  We gave you some duckies.  Like the Beatles, you know.  All right, give us some Beatles.  Need a little help from my friends.  Oh, sing some Beatles.  Yeah, Beatles.  Let's go.  Yeah.  Yesterday.  All right, something from the Beatles?  Do yesterday.  I'll play it on the flute.  Yeah, play it on the flute.  Come on, play the flute.  That's good.  Come on, let me get it, guys. 
[02:26:30]  It's a timeless song.  Gray Wolf plays a mean, mean flute.  Timeless.  We have fun, guys.  Until right now.  It'd be nice to me.  Oh, God.  All right, here we go.  We got the flute and everything.  All right, everyone's going to have to flute also.  All right, here we go.  All right, here we go.  I can't remember. 
[02:27:00]  Yesterday.  Suddenly.  HIV.  Come on, Tom.  Got a needle hanging out of me.  My friend of mine is still with Tudy.  Yesterday.  Why she had to go.  I don't know why she did. 
[02:27:30]  Something wrong.  Something wrong with yesterday.  Yesterday.  Yesterday.  Yesterday.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Joe Popper.  Yeah.  Joe Popper.  All right, Tommy.  Put him there and a high five again.  Oh, Z.  Wow.  Oof.  Jesus.  He just performed on the Real Life's radio. 
[02:28:00]  His hands.  He sang on the air yesterday.  And I was your musical what?  A company.  What other Beatles you know?  I love it with.  What other Beatles you know on that thing, on the flute?  Yeah.  I know everything.  You know any more Beatles, Tom, that you could sing to with him on the flute?  Let it be.  Yeah, let it be.  Nice.  Let it be.  Yeah, all right.  Hold on, hold on.  Let it be.  Can you play it?  No. 
[02:28:30]  That's the lyrics.  More to it.  Yeah.  Right.  Right.  How about some Christmas music?  No, let's do some of my Rod Stewart.  All right.  All right.  Rob Stewart.  You want to get me?  Yeah, you want my body.  Yeah, I'm going to think I'm sucked ass. 
[02:29:00]  Do we get any more collections, 20s and 15s?  Come on, Paul.  I'm getting up already.  I'm just having fun.  All right.  How about Christmas songs?  Everyone knows Christmas songs.  No, no, no.  Come on, Christmas is springtime.  Remember, that's the one I did.  Oh, you're the bouncer here.  What else can I do?  Hey, Grey Wolf, what else can you play?  Something cool that Tommy could sing to.  Here we go.  Here we go.  How about some 50 Cent?  Birds fly somewhere over the rainbow. 
[02:29:30]  You want to do it?  Lost in a lullaby.  One day when I was all alone.  We started from the beginning.  All right, all right, all right.  I have to start over.  Hey, we're working on this one.  This must have been what it was like working with Axl. 
[02:30:00]  It's a big pain in the ass.  Over the rainbow.  Lights fly.  Way up high.  Over the rainbow.  Lost in a lullaby.  One day when I was all alone.  You got a second part before that.  No!  This must be like what Billie Holiday was like, right?  Because she OB'd on the grandstand. 
[02:30:30]  This also reminds me of the new Metallica movie that's out.  It's like watching James and Lars in the studio.  Now I got a fraction score.  This is some kind of homeless.  Some kind of homeless.  Let me see.  This is kind of homeless.  This big child.  He tapped it with the end of the flute.  He tapped it with the end of the flute.  Did you tap that with the mouth end of the flute?  I don't want to see the monkey.  He just killed it with the end of the flute.  Just tapped his scallop with the mouth end of his flute.  He had to kill something.  That's all.  That's no big deal. 
[02:31:00]  He was looking at his hair like the monkeys do with each other.  All right, why don't we...  I can't do his hips.  All right, why don't we...  We got to get to...  It's not unusual being loved with anyone.  I can't do that one on there.  What do you got?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  All the time.  All right, listen, we got more news finally.  Oh, finally.  That was a little filler there.  You're great.  Good job.  What is this here?  A little more news there.  Gray Wolf, help him through it, all right?  A little school teacher.  All right, we're going to finish up the news segment with Tippi Tom and Gray Wolf here. 
[02:31:30]  I was suggesting they are sucks and push charges.  Hold on, here we go.  Here we go.  Wait, Tom.  Tom, Tom, Tom, Tom.  Hold on.  Hold on, here we go.  I'm reading.  All right, I don't know.  Here's the second half of the news with Gray Wolf and Tippi Tom.  You want to start it?  Tommy, shut up.  No, no, no.  Well, it's Gray Wolf.  That means I'm the anchor.  You're the co-anchor.  All right, you read it.  Here we go.  Am I on the right page?  Wait a minute.  Let me...  I have to take a look at this. 
[02:32:00]  That 17 looks really good.  There's no...  Yeah, there's no...  Okay.  Here we go.  A Brooklyn Middle School teacher.  Wow.  I would have loved to be with her.  Oh, man.  A married mother of three.  Don't add that to it.  She was arrested yesterday on sex abuse charges.  Becoming.  I love the word.  Becoming.  The third fellow female educator nabbed in a week for a leg. 
[02:32:30]  For a leg?  You want to read that word there?  What is that word?  For a leg.  Shang-La.  He got it.  With male students.  She's Shang-La.  Shang-La is like somewhere in no man's land.  It's sort of like a place that don't exist.  It's a no man's land.  It's another song.  It looks as if a rev.  Al Sharpton. 
[02:33:00]  Oh, my God.  I never did really, really, really understood that man.  His hair was never combed the proper way.  Who endorsed Fernando Herrera.  He sounded like Mitch Hedberg.  Fernando Herrera is from the Bronx.  I never trust the Bronx.  That's why it's the man.  A major in 2001 will spill out this year's Democratic bomb.  Primarily.  All right.  Well, there are some things that I do not know. 
[02:33:30]  Hand it over to Tippi now.  I like the Mary part.  I don't know about the prime.  All right.  But I like Mary.  All right.  Let's go to Tippi Tom.  Now it's Tippi Tom.  Mary you.  Amy Fischer.  Go ahead.  Oh, I love Amy Fischer.  She did.  All right.  She did a fruco.  All right.  Let's go to Tippi Tom.  This is your turn.  Bottom here.  Okay.  Amy Fischer's middle-aged husband dropped a dime on the former.  Long Island, Lillow, whatever. 
[02:34:00]  Lolita.  Lo, Lo, Lo, Lo something.  Island Lolita.  Whatever I'm reading, damn it.  My turn.  And phony police.  30 seconds wouldn't tune into a 6 o'clock newscast that was like this.  Not a phony police.  Not a phony police.  Not a phony police.  Not a phony police.  Not a phony police.  I thought it was a phony police.  No phony police.  No phony police.  You would be the highest you would have a newscast ever. 
[02:34:30]  Go ahead.  Let me get rid of this.  30 seconds still commercial, guys.  Come on.  Try to get through the copy.  Shut up.  It's my son.  She became savage.  I'm embarrassing you.  She became loud and abusive.  And, and.  What happened to the gray wolf's forehead?  Huh?  What happened to the gray wolf's forehead?  Yeah, maybe a tomahawk.  An argument over a 17-year-old stepson. 
[02:35:00]  The source was told.  I'll get her next time.  Ah!  All right.  You didn't like that story, Tom?  I gotta take a break.  That's all right.  Take a break?  Take a break.  I think that was a great big story about Amy Fisher.  Amy Fisher's middle-aged husband dropped a dime on a former Long Island Lolita,  phoning police because she became loud and abusive in an argument over a 17-year-old stepson 
[02:35:30]  sought to sell the post yesterday.  Drop some.  All right.  Let's, uh, Tibby Tom, final story from Tibby Tom, then we're going to move on.  Oh, then we've got to get him out of here.  I can't breathe.  All right.  Just right here.  You've got to end with a cute story.  That's how they do it on TV.  Human interest story.  Human interest story.  Let's go.  Tibby Tom back in action.  All right.  Here we go.  Let's go.  Hong Kong.  Las Vegas.  Russia.  Russia.  Chinese men have no reason to feel inferior about the size of their apprentices, according to a Hong Kong study, 
[02:36:00]  which showed local men measured up to others elsewhere in the world below the belt.  Well, no one with a long dick is going to show up.  Remember, Asian people don't have to be shy about their apprentices.  That's okay.  So you're not as big as the Americans. 
[02:36:30]  You know?  You know?  Some people look like I'm bigger, some are a little smaller.  I think you're honest.  So don't be afraid.  Be shy.  You know what Rock and Roll Tommy said when he was taking me on the plane for that ride to Hong Kong?  He says, we're going to Japan.  You know, we are big in Japan.  And when we got there, we were big.  Everybody else was little.  Oh, Jesus.  Wow.  Is that it? 
[02:37:00]  All right.  Tibby Tom and Graywell.  Woo!  I'm taking a break.  Yeah, go take a break.  Get out of here.  Go take a break.  I'm taking a break.  All right.  There he goes.  Tibby Tom and Graywell.  He's touching the door.  That's good.  Oh, I won't touch the door.  He said that 30 years ago when this part of his life began.  I'm taking a break.  Yes, Graywell.  I'm taking a break.  I'll be right back.  This is to thank Obi and Anthony for having me back on the show.  And welcome to having a great show again. 
[02:37:30]  Thank you, sir.  From that last time that that thing happened, I was upstate doing a rehab, trying to strain out my life.  And my life had turned all for the better.  Thanks to all you guys.  That's fantastic.  And that Stony Hill Mall gave me an opportunity to strain out my life.  I thank you, and I thank the show.  What tribe are you from?  My mom is a Chiacawa Apache from Geronimo's nation.  My father is a portable Rican Italian.  You pack his bags, he go anywhere.  That's why he's portable. 
[02:38:00]  Oh.  Feel free, Bill.  Anytime you want to hit that button.  There he goes.  Great one.  Wait, wait, wait, wait.  Oh, God.  Oh, dude, you got to stop.  Should we take a break so we can clean up?  Wow.  I got to win, dude.  We got to disinfect that side of the studio.  Look at how dirty the paper is.  Can you hold this paper?  The paper, look where he was holding it.  Let me see.  Look how dirty it is where he was holding it.  Oh, my God.  These hands are so, like, just black.  He spit all over my arm.  He spit on your arm?  We need some Purell. 
[02:38:30]  I need a Purell bath.  What about those bugs?  If you want my body.  I'm singing some Rob Stewart.  We'll go to break with a little song.  It's my turn.  It's so belligerent.  It's Brother Joe's SARS song.  Oh, good.  Yeah.  It's one of the listeners suggested we needed SARS.  We need SARS masks.  Can you open that window or anything?  No, unfortunately we can't.  Unfortunately.  I wish.  I wouldn't anyway.  When we get back, Mary Carey, the porn star that was arrested the other day. 
[02:39:00]  Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.  Sick with the SARS.  I cough and I wheeze.  That incurable illness.  Thank the Chinese for SARS.  Infected with SARS. 
[02:39:30]  I cough, I'm in vain.  I must have caught it from that chink on the plane with SARS.  Sickened by SARS, and it really shows. 
[02:40:00]  My right lung exploded and blew out of my nose.  It's SARS.  Chinese gave me SARS.  I am very sick, but I'm not like them.  With their really small height and SARS.  Like sand through the hourglass, so is the O&A virus. 
[02:40:30]  Let's say hi to Dragon Wagon.  Yeah, guys.  You...  Totally.  What?  What?  You broke up.  We can't hear you.  You totally offended me today.  You totally...  You're talking...  I was an over-the-road truck driver, and this dude of these things, you know, I was talking 
[02:41:00]  about it is ridiculous.  What are you talking about?  The what thing, sir?  Could you take in any histamine before you call next time, clogged-nosed idiot?  It's...  It's...  It's...  You guys are disgusting.  I mean, you know, I turned it on.  I'm calling next to him and complaining about this channel.  Oh.  That's all of this to it.  Really?  Yeah.  What don't you like about the channel?  Well, you guys are...  You wouldn't be Howard, sir.  I mean, you know, it's... 
[02:41:30]  It's...  It's...  It's immoral, what you're talking about.  You know what you should do, sir?  Before you...  Right after you call XM, you should drink a fifth of Old Grandad and then drunk drive  into a schoolyard.  No one cares about you, or if you're offended.  Block the channel, stupid.  It's an XL channel.  You can block it.  That's why XM has that.  You need to F you.  That's what you need to do, okay?  I'm hanging up.  Good.  Hang up.  Cancel XM and drop dead.  I'll also go that far.  All right.  Don't cancel XM.  Go to listen to XM Kids or something. 
[02:42:00]  Yeah, go...  Yeah, exactly.  Maybe that's the wrong thing to say in front of Eric Logan.  And this guy, now he's listening to himself.  He'll be listening.  I'll go with Sirius Radio.  Good.  Go to Sirius Radio.  There's a fucking dog for the thing.  They stink.  You're going to have to drive a truck to have Sirius.  Throw it in the back of the truck, you fucking hick.  Die.  See, get in front of me.  I can run you over.  Why don't you fucking blow your nose before you call a national radio show,  you crank-doing jerk-off. 
[02:42:30]  Now he's listening to himself.  Of course he is.  He'll be listening.  Of course he will.  He'll be listening.  He'll call tomorrow.  And he doesn't even have the balls to say, fuck you.  We're uncensored, pal.  You can say, fuck you.  I don't believe in that.  You don't believe in that?  You're a liar and you're a failure.  Well, I'm not a failure.  Yes, you are.  I'm an over-the-road truck driver.  Why don't you have your fucking sinuses fixed?  I'm an over-the-road truck driver.  All truck drivers are over-the-road, stupid. 
[02:43:00]  They don't go through lawns and pools.  You redundant shithead.  I didn't hear you, sir.  I'm doing drugs and surviving an incest experience.  Break-up, break-up for the Dragon Wagon.  Is that his name, Dragon Wagon?  Dragon Wagon.  You're a grown man with a name that rhymes. 
[02:43:30]  It doesn't matter what it takes.  Oh, yeah.  I'm sorry.  You sounded like you had more brains on the radio.  We've got a long way to do it.  And it's short time to get there.  Hold on, sir.  We've found a retro man to grunt.  Wait, is your name really, dude, is your name really Dragon Wagon?  You're a grown man with a name that rhymes.  Hey, slow down with the weird grown-up names. 
[02:44:00]  Yeah, that's a child's name.  At least it doesn't rhyme.  It's not Mopey Opie.  It's Mopey Opie.  Slim Jim.  And whatever the fuck rhymes with Anthony.  I can't think of anything.  Shmanthony.  If you don't understand, I'm out here busting my ass for you people to be doing your dumb radio show.  How are you busting your ass for us, stupid?  You're busting your ass to put food on your fat wife's table.  We have nothing to do with it.  No, you're the type that voted for George Bush, aren't you?  You're the type that voted for...  No, sir, I don't vote. 
[02:44:30]  I talk a lot of shit, and then I sit home on election day.  That's the beauty of me.  But you're the reason the fuel prices are so hot in this country driving...  I'm the reason, you motherfucker, you drive a truck!  I have a Saturn.  I cruise prostitutes in Manhattan.  Your food has to get there.  You have fucking 80 gallons of fuel in your vehicle.  I go a month on a gallon of gas.  43rd Street to 15th Street.  Circle for four hours.  Back home.  Opie and Anthony.  The virus is spreading. 
[02:45:00]  This is Chris Jericho, the sexy beast of the WWE and the lead singer of Fozzy.  And this is Opie and Anthony.  Listen up, kids.  He does sound like Ozzy. 
[02:45:30]  Huh?  He sounds a little bit like Ozzy.  I was thinking of your day.  Chris Jericho's doing a good job with that band.  Fozzy.  Fozzy, you take away the F.  What do you got?  Ozzy.  Ozzy.  Ozzy.  Ozzy.  Ozzy.  Ozzy.  Huh?  Ah.  What the hell's going on there?  Good thing he didn't call it Fawful.  I like it.  I really do like it.  The song called Enemy.  Ah, you're a pip.  All right.  Let's set the scene here.  This is one of those train wreck shows.  I've got to explain this stuff to the new listeners. 
[02:46:00]  Some days we're quite funny and clever, and other days it's just a train wreck for you to listen to.  Today is one of those train wreck shows.  I've found the Tippy Tom segments to be very funny.  All right.  Very good.  Does it still smell in here, do you think?  I can't even tell anymore.  It probably does.  If you walked out, came back in, well, walked out of the entire building and came back in, probably really reek.  Yeah, there's still some type of a doody odor.  You're going to wear any of these clothes tomorrow?  No, no.  I'm burning these.  Bill Burren's studio.  What do you think so far, Bill?  Thinking I should have come in Friday. 
[02:46:30]  I had the option, too.  Yeah.  You really did.  Bill's tape in HBO Special, too.  Him and Patrice are doing the same night.  You guys are doing it Monday, I think, the night before I'm doing it.  Yeah, Monday night.  Nice.  At the Skirball Theater in the Village.  Yeah, Bill Burr at BroadwayVideo.com.  There you go.  For free tickets.  Yes.  Very, very, very, very cool.  And we had a little meeting in the bathroom.  Oh, yeah, that was lovely.  I just got to talk about Hitler Hughes.  Fucking poor Eric is in there wiping AIDS spit off his arm. 
[02:47:00]  And he's like, dude, Eric, you've got to pay attention.  I mean, I know you're doing a good job, but the guys are firing out lines.  You're not looking.  Well, here's the deal, because these guys were rock and rolling, Bill and you.  And, you know, Eric needed better mic technique.  Like, if he took the mic away from Tippi Tom and Gregold for a second or two, you would have heard the lines better.  That's all I was trying to say.  And what was your response?  I said, sorry.  Hold on, hold on, hold on.  I said, sorry.  I wasn't focused when I was getting a shit smell and spit all over my arm.  It is completely distracting. 
[02:47:30]  He's fucking standing there.  The guy has AIDS, and he's spitting on his arm, and he smells like shit.  Yeah.  And he wants to know, why didn't you pick up the radio cue?  Dude, you've got to pay attention.  Hard than him.  No one ever got it through saliva.  The best part is, we're both at urinals, Jim and I, and Eric is actually scrubbing.  Yeah.  I didn't really pick up on that until we were leaving, but he's scrubbing his arms down.  Yeah.  And I'm, like, trying to give him some constructive criticism.  Yeah, dude, you're doing a good job, but just pay attention a little bit.  He's scrubbing like Trapper John, trying to get AIDS off his forearm. 
[02:48:00]  You will see me at the end of the show.  I will stand.  I will not touch anything.  Someone's going to have to open the door, because I refuse to touch the door.  I will then go to the office, put my coat on, without bumping into anything or touching  anything, and then walk right out of here, without touching a goddamn thing.  Can you imagine Tippy Tom, like, just trying to cover your mouth so you can't yell?  Oh, man, with his hand.  You'd smell it.  You'd smell his finger.  Oh, oh. 
[02:48:30]  And then your kind of mouth was open a little, so...  And your tongue touched it?  Your hand touches your tongue.  Help!  And the tippin' tongue battered.  Can you taste that goo?  All right, we're going to move on to the next Trainwreck segment.  Yeah, and it will be.  What's been going on out there?  You've got Mary Carey and Tawny Roberts, two porn girls, and I don't think that they've  slept a wink, and it looks like they're still reeling from whatever they were drinking last  night.  Drinking, yeah.  So they're just wobbling all over. 
[02:49:00]  Drinking, smoking, snorting.  I heard they were a little upset that they're being a little diva-like, a little upset they  had to wait.  Yeah, yeah, there's some of that porn diva stuff thing going on, and they're just...  They don't want the homeless people in here while they're in here.  What's going on with the porn stars these days?  They're starting to get attitudes.  Yeah, I don't get it.  Some are really cool, some have attitudes, and it's a coin toss whether or not you get  the attitude.  But they were doing...  Is Tippy Tom still here?  Huh?  He's around somewhere.  I saw Gray Wolf out there.  If Tippy Tom is still here, then they will absolutely...  That's fine.  ...come in when...  Yeah, we've got to get a little contrasting going on.  Oh, yeah.  He goes naked first. 
[02:49:30]  Oh, yeah.  Let's get married naked first.  They're totally cool with that.  Bring her and Tony in.  Ooh.  Hey, we're not communists.  Oh, this is good, though, huh?  Yeah.  We got the bad shit out of the way?  Well, this is what we do.  Visually bad.  Yeah, then we get the bad taste out of your mouth.  We got to go.  Thank you, Angel.  This is getting the bad taste out of your mouth.  Hopefully they have a lot of perfume on.  Tony Roberts.  I'm going to have to pee again.  Oh, nice.  Jesus.  Sorry to make you guys wait.  I know.  We met you in Vegas, Mary.  I know.  I was so stoned.  You were stoned that time?  Yeah.  I don't even remember what I said.  I heard it, too.  Look at these two California girls. 
[02:50:00]  Can I read this?  Jesus Christ.  I want to read.  You want to read?  I want to use my private school and college education.  This is a big day for Mary.  She's got a raid.  And I got arrested.  Yay.  Yeah, we heard about the arrest.  You're so retarded.  I can't even know.  I don't get my own mic.  Oh, you can share with me.  Yeah, we have a limited mic.  Well, we share everything, don't we?  Limited microphones.  There we go.  We've run out of microphones.  We have real broadcasters.  Why am I working with me?  Oh, she pulled the little windscreen off the mic.  You're a ruffer.  She's a ruffer.  Oh, we called her a whore. 
[02:50:30]  I like that.  Well, girls, you've got to focus here, girls.  Focus.  Hey, let's share headphones.  They should be topless.  Yeah.  Yeah, Steve, direct.  Steve, please.  Yeah.  Yeah.  No, put overcoats on them.  Wow.  Oh, my goodness.  Do you have some lovely giant bosoms?  It took us a long time to get me in the shirt because I had to hug it.  Those are really nice.  Thank you.  Can I read now?  All right.  You can read, Mary Kay.  Am I doing the news?  Yeah?  Yeah, yeah.  I want my headphones on.  You want to put the headphones on? 
[02:51:00]  You're sure?  Yeah.  That might mix you up a little bit.  No, I'm really smart.  Yeah?  Ready?  I'll read one.  She'll read one.  I'll read one.  She'll read one.  All right.  We're going to redo the news.  Oh, are we going to read the news?  No, no.  This is okay.  Do the news.  New stories.  New stories.  Adult film star Mary Kay was arrested in Lakewood, Washington for touching herself inappropriately.  There was a lieutenant who said that she did that.  That's the first story.  Did you do that?  No.  No.  Next story.  What happened?  Yeah, what happened?  Oh, wait.  We're in the news.  Maybe the story's almost done.  I kind of want the details. 
[02:51:30]  This is the exclusive on the news, though.  This is part of the news.  Yeah.  Okay.  Basically, it's a club that was totally retarded in Lakewood, Washington.  Really?  The retarded girls and stuff and retarded staff?  I'd go there.  No, they're not retarded, but I mean, basically, it's like, here's an example of how small the city  is.  The only four girls that were at the jail were the four of us from the strip club.  Like, normally, you would have, like, the drunk people.  You know, you'd have more people in the jail cells.  There should be more chicks in the jail.  I mean, honestly, for my personal jail experience, it was pleasant.  Like, I had fun.  I had bad.  Really?  Like, even though it's scary to have charges, I got advice when the only time I get arrested 
[02:52:00]  in life, it was a good experience.  What did they...  I have street credibility now, and that's really cool.  They said that you were touching yourself.  Which is really funny, because in the charges, if you call the DA office, they're saying,  I broke the eight-foot rule on stage, and I touched a female customer.  So they don't even know what...  The lieutenant is saying in print, basically.  And on news channels, a different charge.  I don't think they know what they're charging me with.  They just want to arrest me.  They've been, like, two weeks before that, another porn star was arrested. 
[02:52:30]  But she doesn't want me to admit her name.  Like, she doesn't want me to say her name.  So, like, I won't, because she told me that to...  Did you just, like, rhyme something to it?  I don't think her name rhymes with anything.  Okay.  And, like, I want to give her to Felicity, because I'm not really...  I'm not really happy with this girl, because she kind of is the reason I'm in trouble, basically.  I was not going to go to the club, even after I heard she got arrested.  Yeah.  But she convinced me to attend it and go and dance.  Remember, I called her.  She's my best friend, Tawny Roberts.  And I said, I shouldn't go to this club.  I'm going to get arrested.  She told me not to go.  I told you not to go.  You did.  Wow, you seem shit-faced. 
[02:53:00]  Wow.  Tawny is shit-faced.  Tawny is...  Mary Kelly!  Are you drunk?  Me?  Yeah.  No, I'm just hungover.  Oh.  What are you looking for?  What are you looking for right now?  I heard, like, the first sentence you said was really slurred.  That's terrific.  It was, like, slurred.  You kind of went, you know, slurred.  That's really rude.  No, it's not rude.  It's not rude.  Anthony's a very rude guy.  If I see somebody that maybe had, you know, had a couple drinks, I'll ask if they're drunk. 
[02:53:30]  I thought she sounded fine to us.  If you weren't, that's cool.  Anthony, I thought you sounded great.  I don't know what's wrong with Anthony.  I thought that was just then.  I think you sounded fine to me.  Yeah, I think Anthony had a bad morning.  Can I read something?  It was really rude.  How's it a lot of line, Anthony?  You're really out of line.  I'm out of line.  You're the guest on the show.  How do you expect to get guests on the show if you're going to be rude to them?  I'm out of line.  Anthony, I think her boobs look really nice.  They're fabulous.  I don't know why.  Her body is fantastic.  But why were you rude to her?  Yeah, why? 
[02:54:00]  I want to know.  I was under the assumption that you might have had a little alcohol because you were slurring something.  It sounded like your speech was a little slurred.  Anthony, but that's not what you were saying about her boobs when we went into commercial.  I didn't even see her before commercial.  They're beautiful.  I didn't even see her before commercial.  Don't hang me out to dry.  Don't cover up.  Why are you covering up?  Just because Anthony doesn't like your boobs.  She has a sticker on.  Three out of four people.  You're hanging me out to dry. 
[02:54:30]  I never saw you before.  I didn't see her.  Why is she putting on an overcoat because of you, Anthony?  I didn't say anything.  I only asked if she had been drinking.  That's all I said.  That's ridiculous, Anthony.  That's okay.  That's really ridiculous.  Why are you mad?  She's giving you the evil eye.  Why are you mad at me?  I was just asking.  You're assuming something that I'm not.  Yep.  I just assumed that you had been drinking because your speech was a little sad.  And I disagree with Anthony. 
[02:55:00]  I think you're just as hot as Mary Kay.  I didn't say anything about the way she looked.  Hey, don't hang me out to dry.  I didn't even see this girl.  I was just asking.  I think you're beautiful.  She is beautiful.  She's gorgeous.  Yeah.  Of course she is.  No, it's funny.  Honestly, they weren't saying anything about your looks.  No.  They thought you were a little intoxicated.  I thought you were.  That's all.  Only Anthony said something about your looks.  I mean, last night we drank a lot.  She's just hung over.  That's all.  Are you hung over?  That's cool.  You're a party girl.  We're both hung over.  We're hung over.  That's it.  When the alcohol wears off, I'm sure she'll look really, really good, Anthony. 
[02:55:30]  Why are you going to do food to her?  That's what I'll be.  Anthony, you've never been hung over?  I've been hung over many times.  God.  She fucked a lot.  As a guest early in the morning, they wake up early to come in and hang out with us.  You've got to be disrespectful.  I just told me.  I didn't insult.  That is not an insult.  Ridiculous.  It was an inquiry.  It is.  It was an inquiry.  I was inquiring as to if you had been drinking.  It's definitely an insult.  How is that an insult?  He does this all the time.  How is it an insult?  Because you're assuming something.  I'm drunk and I'm not.  Exactly.  All right.  I mean, come on.  But you were drunk last night. 
[02:56:00]  Yes, I was drunk last night.  It doesn't mean I'm drunk now.  But up until what time?  What time was like two?  I got yellow.  Two or three.  Two or three.  Two or three.  So you could still be feeling the effects maybe, like hung over a little.  Maybe I'm a little bit tired.  I think you owe an apology.  I think so too.  I'll join her.  I already did.  I apologize.  I apologize for assuming that.  I need to hear it again.  Yeah.  You're drunk.  Yeah.  All right.  What do I know?  Trust me.  Let me have a minute. 
[02:56:30]  Everyone close your ears, okay?  All right.  Let's shh.  Okay.  Basically, I'm just a little upset because you were drinking, but they love you.  It's okay.  I love you.  What are you talking about?  You're doing the same thing.  No, no, no.  I love you.  I'm just saying they just misunderstood you.  They don't realize that you're just like, oh, he's happy.  But Mary, you're saying she's kind of drunk too, though.  No, I'm not going to do the same thing.  No, no, no.  I'm saying.  Can you rewind it?  No, I'm going to be honest.  I had some drinks this morning.  Okay.  This morning.  You had a couple.  All right.  That's fine.  All right.  I condone that.  This is a joyous party. 
[02:57:00]  I had two shots.  This is a big party.  We're at a party right now.  I had two shots of Jägermeister before I came in this morning at six.  I drank some Red Bull and Vodka.  I'm not asking because.  I just wanted to know where to get some booze around here.  You can't assume Tawny is something that she's not.  No, just because I've been drinking doesn't mean she has.  Why are you?  I think full credit.  I'm the only one who's been drinking.  No, no, no.  She's married me now.  There's no reason to get rude, either.  I know.  I wasn't getting rude.  You jumped all over.  I'm a big fan.  I didn't get rude.  That's just my opinion.  You jumped all over.  And I'm going to admit, I've been drinking, so I'm cool with it.  I've been drinking.  Everyone who's been drinking this morning, raise your hand. 
[02:57:30]  I've been drinking.  See?  Tawny, that's a cool thing to do.  You're not alone.  Now she's all upset.  Everyone that smoked weed this morning, raise your hand.  I wish.  She's drinking coffee.  You guys, last time I had.  I wish I did today.  I smoked a little.  Just a little.  I just heard the coffee.  Tawny is beautiful.  Tawny is beautiful.  I think you're terrific.  Thank you.  I love your stuff.  I'm a big fan of hers, too.  It's too bad that Anthony is the buzzkill.  No, I'm not.  We're all big fans of hers.  Shut up.  I am not.  I think everybody's a big fan of hers, except for Anthony. 
[02:58:00]  What's the latest movie you did?  The latest movie I did was...  You shot it before the Lakers game.  Yeah, and the most beautiful girl in the world.  Who directed that?  Kobe's Revenge.  Yeah, who did that one?  I guess Anthony won't be buying that one.  David Stanley.  Really?  And who did you work with in that one?  A couple of different guys.  A couple of different guys?  Yeah.  Yeah?  How many?  I only do three scenes per movie.  Three scenes per movie?  Oh, well, that's a lot. 
[02:58:30]  That's a lot?  Yeah, that's...  Really?  That would stretch out a woman a little bit.  Let's do standards.  Usually, like, two is boy-girl, and one is, like, girl-girl.  Nice.  How many do you do?  Well, it depends, because I directed my last...  Well, the last one was virtual, Sex, Marry, Care, Experience, which came out yesterday.  How many scenes do you do?  Usually, I do one to two.  Really?  But the Marry, Care, Experience is, like, sex the whole time.  Take me through the park, Bitteman.  And do you do, like, ass and stuff?  I don't do anal, no.  You don't do anal?  Just because you know why, I enjoy pooping.  He's directing that.  I enjoy pooping a lot, and I know that if you take it in the butt, your poop's gonna hurt 
[02:59:00]  the next day.  I try it once, and it's like...  You enjoy pooping a lot?  That's what Jimmy says.  It's like, I want my poop to feel good coming out.  So if you stretch out your butt, it hurts the next day.  Nice.  Seriously.  You guys should all try it.  Yeah.  You should all make a ring.  You guys each take turns on each other.  And the next day, when you try to poop, it's gonna be like, ow.  So it's like, I'm not gonna ruin my pooping experience with anal sex.  Like, absolutely, there's nothing better than just dropping a solid one.  Plus, my vaginal entry is really tight, so I don't need these.  Really?  But it's nice.  Cool.  Do you do any anal? 
[02:59:30]  I used to with my ex-boyfriend.  Yeah?  On film?  Yeah.  Cool.  Who's your ex?  Rick Patrick.  Oh.  He's a retard.  Yeah.  Why do you guys break up?  Because he's a retard.  Why'd you break up?  What happened?  What happened?  Why'd you break up?  What happened?  Why did he leave you?  Money changes people.  So that way.  Oh, do you think he changed once he started making a little bit of cash?  Yeah.  Right.  That's why he took off with everything.  Oh, man.  That's terrible.  Left you at all.  He took off. 
[03:00:00]  Your boobs aren't showing.  Show your boobs.  I'm a big taunt.  I want to see Tawny.  I think she's so lovely.  Yeah, you're very sexy.  We love you.  We love you.  Yeah.  They're shy, though.  Now they love Tawny.  All right, so what?  They look happy.  Can we get back to what happened to Mary Carey at this club?  It's such a couple of things that was so ridiculous.  Was it a setup you're thinking?  Oh, yeah, well, definitely.  Obviously, the club, two weeks before, they just had a new owner, and the other porn star  that came, they raided the club when she was there, and she didn't have her permit.  They actually had the undercover cops getting full nude Polaroids with her. 
[03:00:30]  Now, the rules there are you have to be on stage, if you're naked, eight feet away  from the customer.  Uh-oh.  Lap dances there are fully clothed, four feet away.  Yeah.  So the rules there are obviously really strict.  So when I got to the club, they told me how to get my permit, and I was like, okay, that's  fine.  I've gotten that before.  And they told me the rules.  They told me how another girl got arrested, and I was kind of like, I don't know if I  want to go into this situation.  Oh, you can.  I don't know.  But I was like, I'll be very tame.  I did no Polaroids.  The first show, no Polaroids.  The second show, I stayed up on, like, eight feet away.  Made sure I stayed on the upper level of the stage so I was away from the customers.  So then I went to get my friend in the club. 
[03:01:00]  I walked to the front door.  I took my robe, which was wrapped around me, and I was holding it like this.  You know, well, holding it under my armpit, so let's just go.  And all of a sudden, I saw four cops run by me.  So I was like, I think I'm going to leave.  So I just took out running, and my friend got in the car, and I ducked down the backseat  and we tried to drive away.  Oh, so you're trying.  And four undercovers, like, flashed our backseat with guns in the car, like, get out of the car  with your hands over your head.  And I'm like, well, I can't, because my robe will fall.  You know, then they made me.  Exactly.  My robe fell, so I was naked in pink fishnets and heels, getting handcuffed.  You have the greatest portions on earth, by the way. 
[03:01:30]  Thank you.  They just suck, though, because getting arrested, like, basically, I think it's just a small  town trying to, they're just, I think the club owner just doesn't know which person  to be paying off right now in the city.  It's what happened.  He's only been open for three weeks now.  And they definitely struck the night I was there, because they knew the attendance would  be high, and it would get word around the city that the club has cops at it.  And they originally said they arrested me for one thing, and now they're saying  another thing in the news.  So it's a bunch of BS.  And here's the funniest thing, I have an arraignment date for me a second, yet they  still haven't posted official charges, but they're arraigning me. 
[03:02:00]  Yeah.  Don't you usually need charges to arraign somebody?  Yeah, what's the deal with that?  Either Washington, it's different than Washington or Washington.  It's Lakewood, Washington, which is 45 minutes from Seattle.  Yeah.  It's absolutely, it's ridiculous.  I think I'm going to run for governor of Washington next, because these strip cover  holes need to be changed.  You're getting a lot of publicity, though.  That's great.  Yeah, it definitely was good.  At first, I was, like, devastated.  I called her up.  They called, my friend called her until I was arrested, and she thought it was an April Fool's  joke.  Yeah.  Oh, wait, the drunk girl wants to talk.  What?  At April Fool's Day, she said she was drunk and arrested. 
[03:02:30]  At April Fool's Day, my friend Jessica and I played a joke on her.  We called a whole bunch of people up and said that I beat the shit out of a girl, and I  was going to jail, and so everyone, when I really was arrested, I was a fool's joke.  Nobody believes it.  No, we believe it.  So I've never been arrested.  I'm a pretty good girl.  That's what happens when you try a wolf throw.  That sounds like drinking and driving right there.  I don't do that.  Oh, wow.  Let's do that.  No, I really don't.  All right, are we going to do the news now, or?  Yeah, wait, can I read it?  Yeah, you can.  You ready?  You can be naked.  Is this honestly, honestly, do we need a news read, or no?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Yeah, I really want to try, because I'm trying to get my own radio show. 
[03:03:00]  All right, let's go.  I was a communications major.  Mary, what, Steve?  What do you want me to say?  Show Jimmy your butt.  There you go.  Yeah, Jimmy loves butts.  Ask me to read the news.  She can show her butt.  I want to read my news.  All right.  I'll show my ass.  All right.  Hopefully, Anthony will like your ass at least.  Is this basketball on TV?  I've had sex with so many basketball players.  It's so crazy.  I had sex with a pacer, even.  Really?  I can't see it.  Every team, Mary.  No, only like seven.  I can't see, miss.  Okay, I'm going to read the news. 
[03:03:30]  Wow.  Hold on.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God, basketball.  I love basketball players.  I've had sex with so many NBA players.  Are you ready?  Wow.  Can I read the news now?  Yeah, could you name some names?  I mean, you've had sex with a lot of famous people.  Um, some of them, like, I can't wait because some of them, then none of them will have sex  with me.  Can I just read the news?  Who had, like, a really big mule?  Eddie Griffin on the Timberwolves.  Steve, take that picture over here.  He's the hottest NBA player on earth.  Who had a small mule?  I can't see it. 
[03:04:00]  Come on.  See, like, okay, the big guy, the guy with the big dick is proud, the guy with the small dick  would be sad.  All right, well, who have you heard might have a small dick?  I heard about some, actually, I really did hear about someone who's a really big, one  of the biggest guys in the NBA, second biggest guy in the NBA.  Well, the biggest was second tallest, and I heard he has a small penis.  Who, what's his name?  He's in the heat.  Oh, really?  Just rubbing it.  I heard from some girls.  And he was in Los Angeles, right?  Yeah, one point.  Okay, ready?  Time for the news.  Check.  Time for the news.  Ready?  Check.  Check got a tiny penis.  Mary, how big did you hear it was? 
[03:04:30]  Did you hear it was, like, six or eight?  I didn't hear the size.  I just heard it was small.  Wow.  Isn't that weird?  Compared to the rest of them.  Honestly, Eddie Griffin on the Timberwolves.  It's all relative.  The guy's a monster.  Eddie Griffin can come, like, over and over and over again.  It's crazy.  Who's Eddie Griffin on the Timberwolves?  He was number seven in the draft.  That guy did Malcolm and Eddie, right?  Yeah.  Eddie, I'll show you his picture, actually.  You can play Hope, too.  Did you perform oral session on him?  I have it on my sidekick.  Hold on, let me pull it up.  I'll show you guys, Eddie.  You got it.  Ah, there he is.  Can we see him?  Jeez.  There he is. 
[03:05:00]  That's Eddie.  Wow.  Can I read the news?  I just really want to see if I'm good at it.  All right, let's see some news.  Is this really the news?  Wow.  You ready?  I'm going to try to sound like a real news girl.  What about the Charlotte Bobcats?  Would you ever have any sex with anyone on that?  Charlotte the Bobcats.  Oh, isn't...  Oh, yeah.  Cream Rush is on the Bobcats.  Yeah.  I know Kareem.  Yeah, I know Kareem.  So, yeah, if it's like an expansion team, you don't draw the line?  No, I know Kareem because I met him right after, right before the Lakers and the Pistons  had their first game, like a year ago, and I was still married.  Kareem and I were dancing together.  My husband interfered. 
[03:05:30]  My husband interfered with him and Tracy McGrady, Michael and Candy.  Sounds like you have good reason to.  But now I'm single, so I can have sex with him.  Do you ever hook up with anybody in like the CBA or like the IHL?  Just NBA.  Just NBA.  You're like any other sports teams?  No, just basketball.  Just basketball?  Really?  I don't know why.  Really?  I don't know why.  Why is that?  I don't know.  I think I have mental problems.  Yeah?  Are they white guys and black guys or just black guys?  Well, one best player of the white guy is Mario Cassoon.  I'll say his name.  How about Bill Walton?  Do you ever hook up with him?  Oh, my God. 
[03:06:00]  You know what's funny?  Nate Walton ran for governor.  Bill Walton's son is...  Okay.  Bill Walton had sons, Nate and Luke.  Luke Walton's a Laker.  Poor Nate Walton.  All I got to say is because he was here every single day.  When I was MVP, you know what I mean?  Can you imagine being Bill Walton's son and not making it in the NBA?  What's the deal?  I don't know.  Nate Walton, he goes to Berkeley now.  He ran for governor against me.  I can't believe Bill let his son run for governor.  That's ridiculous.  I don't know.  That's ridiculous.  I mean, honestly, for me, it was a good PR system.  Why would Bill Walton want his son to do it in Berkeley and run for governor? 
[03:06:30]  And make him look like a silly...  Why isn't Bill?  It's one thing if I look like an idiot, but like...  Why isn't the other girl talking?  Yeah, how come Tony's not?  She's very...  Because I'm a Gemini and I talk a lot more than her.  Okay.  But can I just do one thing really quickly?  How many votes did Nate get?  Nate Walton.  I don't know.  I came in 10th and he came in way down the line.  So obviously the Walton name didn't go too far.  It's because a lot of people don't like Bill Walton, I don't think, because they don't  like hearing about when he was league MVP over and over again.  It's fascinating.  Every day, you got to hear the same thing and it's like...  When he commentates, it's just...  What?  When he's a commentator, Bill Walton, I turn the TV down and I just watch it again. 
[03:07:00]  All right.  Here we go.  Let's go to the news.  We're going to take turns.  I'll read and she'll read.  It'll be funny.  All right.  Oh, boy.  No, I think we should say turns reading.  I want to share the mic with you.  Yeah, you got to read too, Connie.  Come on, Connie.  You read the first one.  I'll read the second one.  Go.  I want to hear the drunk girl read.  Show how smart you are.  Just because you're drunk?  She's not drunk.  Don't even call her drunk because she's not.  Anthony, what is wrong with you?  She's not drunk.  It was like a joke, right?  Because we were...  It's not very funny.  It's not what we were saying earlier about that.  Can I have a private conversation with her? 
[03:07:30]  All right.  Should I have a private conversation with her?  All right.  I thought it would be a funny joke.  Yeah, you just read.  Anthony, I don't hear people laughing.  I'm sorry.  I thought it was a joke.  I thought it would be a funny joke.  Have a plan.  Everyone, I'm having a private conversation.  They're turning off their mic.  Turn off your mic.  It's off.  Show them how you're not drunk.  And do a really good job, and they'll show you you're not drunk.  Mary, breathe the fuck out.  You'll read this one next?  I just want to go.  I'm just trying to show you're not drunk, okay?  You'll do the second story?  She's drunk.  Okay, I'll do the first story, and she'll do the second one.  Ready?  It was a joke. 
[03:08:00]  I broke in the middle.  I didn't know.  Anthony, Anthony, I'm going to do the first one, and she'll do the second one, because  it's shorter.  All right.  She's drunk.  Ready?  I'll go first, and she'll go second.  Ready?  Can I see her poop shoot?  She's going to show her poop shoot after she reads the news.  Uh-huh.  Okay?  I'm showing it.  See, that's why you're good.  You're on.  See, now she got all upset again.  I think it'd be good to let her read the news and show she's not drunk.  I think that's a good idea.  I'm going to go first, and she's going to do the second.  Right now, all we need is to do the peace and quiet.  All right.  I should not prove myself.  You should not prove yourself.  You're not, but you're going to, because guess what?  High five?  Show point.  Yeah.  Yeah. 
[03:08:30]  Yeah.  You ready?  If there was a cop in the room, let's say, and he was going to give you a sobriety test,  you'd pass it then.  Of course.  Because you're not drunk.  You would.  You guys, honestly, let's just let her read the news.  All right.  Let her do a news story.  Okay.  I'm going to go first, and you're in a second.  Ready?  Good call.  Adrian, come here.  Where are you going?  Adrian.  Where are you going?  Where are you going?  Where are you going?  Here.  There's no crying.  No.  Where are you going?  Did you say there's no crying in baseball?  I said stripping.  That's where the joke is.  Yeah.  There's no crying in baseball.  I love this girl. 
[03:09:00]  I'm going to read mine, and she's going to go next.  You're going to show my good job.  Yeah, you're going to go next.  I'll go first.  Ready?  Tawny, then you're going to go next.  Okay?  All right.  A Brooklyn Middle School teacher, a married mother of three, was arrested yesterday on  sex abuse charges, becoming the third female educator nabbed in a week for alleged shenanigans  of male students.  Tawny, ready?  Go.  Where's she going?  No, don't leave.  Don't leave.  Uh-oh.  Where are you going?  Don't go.  They're not disrespecting you.  No, there's no disrespect here.  It was a joke.  You see, it was a joke because I had said earlier about the drunk thing. 
[03:09:30]  And I was just kidding.  I thought it would be funny to bring it up again.  It's called a callback.  Yeah, it's called a callback.  But it's not funny.  I thought it would be funny to bring it up again.  Yeah, put the headphones on.  I'll shut up now.  I'm going to appreciate if you let me talk with her for a minute.  I'll shut up now.  You talk to the drunk.  You just read the news.  I read the news.  We think you're beautiful, right, guys?  Yeah.  She's beautiful.  I mean, there's no question about it.  Right, Anthony?  She's beautiful.  Absolutely.  Tawny, my bad.  There's no question about it.  There you go.  She's doing the news.  There you go.  Come on, Foster Brooks. 
[03:10:00]  You're doing it.  What are you talking about?  You're doing it.  It looks like it's Ralph Al Shaffer.  I can't even say it.  What are you talking about?  You read the news.  No, I don't want to hear you read it.  I don't even want to do it.  No.  I'll try one more time.  You can do it.  Who cares?  Wait, Mary.  Wow.  I don't want to hear you when the headphones are off.  Okay.  Private conversation.  Go to commercial.  Go to commercial.  Okay, Mary's pants are down.  They can't hear you when the headphones are off.  But I don't want to fucking read.  Listen, they can't hear you when the headphones are off.  Just read the second story. 
[03:10:30]  Don't put your headphones on.  They can't even hear you.  No.  But listen.  You read it, Mary.  I'm not...  No, just try it.  Show them how smart you are.  Come on.  Just try it.  Okay, you read this one then.  Skip this one.  There's not that you are.  I'm not reading anything.  It looks as if the Reverend Al Sharpton...  Hey, Mary, we didn't get to hear what happened.  What happened?  Why won't she...  Will she do it?  Wait, Connie.  They can't hear it.  Wait, she grabs one's off, so they can't hear it.  Will she do it?  Here's what...  What happened?  What happened?  I think you should show them how smart you are.  No, I don't want to do anything. 
[03:11:00]  But you can do it.  I know you.  I know.  I just...  Let's show it to them.  Just go for it.  Just go for it.  $100 if you get her.  Connie, it's worth it.  Show how smart you are.  Oh, I can do it one second.  $100.  Show how smart you are.  $100?  Yeah.  Come on, you don't have the headphones on.  They can't hear you.  Just tell them.  Maybe, just read it.  I'll talk.  Okay, read one of them.  Yeah, read this one.  It's easier.  Read this one.  It's really short.  Maybe, just read, and I'll talk.  I want to get a picture with you.  I'm a big fan.  Can I get a picture with you?  I think you're one of my favorites.  Yeah, get a picture.  Yeah, get a picture.  Better get it.  Wait, look at the camera, 
[03:11:30]  because Jimmy wants a nice photo for his website.  See, Jimmy loves you.  Mary, that's it.  She should show everyone how smart you are.  You should read it.  Mary, what's going on over there?  We can't hear you.  All right, Ed.  Okay, okay.  What?  Never mind.  She's not going to read.  Why?  Uh-oh.  What happened?  She said something real quick.  She can't read, right?  She can read?  Opie.  I can't fucking read.  Show them you can read.  Now they think you're dumb.  You can't read.  No.  Now they think you can't read.  Show them how smart you are.  Come on.  Just do it.  I bet if it was the back of a Jack Daniels bottle. 
[03:12:00]  Oh, come on, man.  No, see, now that wasn't...  It's a joke.  No, it's a joke.  It was like, I meant that it's just, if it was...  Eric, like a bot.  Eric, go get the Dr. Seuss book.  Oh, no, no.  Where are you going?  I don't get your brand of humor.  Where are you going?  Don't leave.  No, don't leave.  Yeah, she doesn't want to be a drunk.  She's not a reader.  No, don't.  Don't.  No, don't leave.  Where are you going?  You dropped something.  Why is she leaving?  Mary Terry.  Nobody gets your brand of humor today. 
[03:12:30]  What happened?  No one's getting my humor.  She gets really sensitive when you talk to her about drinking.  Why?  It's happened before with me, like...  Has she a drunk?  I'd be like, Tawny, like, you look really drunk.  Fuck you, Mary, I'm not drunk.  Oh, so it's not us.  Okay.  No, no, it happens all the time.  And I'd be like, Tawny, like, maybe you're a little crazy.  You should tame it down a little.  Yeah.  I'm not crazy.  Eh!  You know?  Yeah.  Especially the eh part, yeah.  Yeah, it's nice for me...  God, that hurts my ears.  You know what's really nice?  For me to even have to deal with that for ten minutes.  That I dealt with it for nine and a half fucking years of my life. 
[03:13:00]  Let me go have a one-on-one conversation.  Same attitude.  We'll bring her in, we've got to bring her in, because I'm not drunk.  I can get her back in.  I'm surprised I'm not 40 large short when she left the room.  I'm going to go get her back in here.  You have to put your top on.  Yeah, I will.  Yeah.  All right, why don't you go get her?  Yeah, go get her back in.  You have the best breasts ever.  I'm going to try to convince her.  Oh, and by the way, if everyone wants to see me and Tawny together, on marycarrie.com,  we have pictures together right now.  Oh.  Can I have a photo with you, Mary?  Everyone can have a photo with me.  But wait, let me just go get her first.  Yeah, go get her.  Because I'm really good at talking her.  Yeah, talk her down. 
[03:13:30]  Why don't we take a break as Mary Carey regroups with the drunk girl.  You want to play vagina?  Yes.  Wow.  That's very...  We'll go get her really quickly.  Okay.  All right, yeah.  She's very sensitive about the drinking.  All right, all right.  It's the drinking issue.  Everyone has to remember.  Mary, you know what you do?  Give her a couple shots, you know, she'll calm down a little bit, and we'll get her back  in here.  She's gorgeous.  All right.  We won't bring up the drinking.  And Eric, bring up the drinking.  And Eric, go get the Dr. Seuss book so she can prove that she can read.  Bring up the drinking.  I knew with that one line I could get her to leave the room.  No, that one will do it. 
[03:14:00]  I owe you 100, but it's well worth it.  All right, we're going to play Hi, Mom, I'm in Porno from RCD as we...  What?  No volume.  They can't hear anything.  As we regroup here, okay, Anthony?  Take a listen to this.  Who's this?  Michelle.  Hi, Michelle.  You want to play Hi, Mom?  Yes, I do.  All right.  I hear you want to play Hi, Mom, I'm in Porno.  Yeah.  Yeah!  Awesome.  Now, where does your mom live?  Montana.  Well, what are you doing in Boston?  I'm a nanny.  You're a nanny.  Cool.  Maybe you could tell your mom you lost your job as a nanny and you had to make ends meet,  so you jumped into porno. 
[03:14:30]  Okay.  All right, I got your mom's number.  I'm giving her the call right now.  Okay.  Nutrition Center.  Hi, can I speak to Jean, please?  Is this Michelle?  Yes, it is.  It's important.  Okay, hold on, hon.  Uh-huh.  Now, play it up.  Say you lost your job.  You had no other choice.  Okay.  You were all alone.  Hello?  Mom?  Yeah?  I have a problem.  I lost my job.  Why?  Because I just wasn't doing it.  I couldn't cope with it, you know.  I thought you said it was going great. 
[03:15:00]  It was, but things just fell apart.  I'm having a really hard time, so I didn't tell you sooner because I was too scared to,  but now I got a different job, but I'm doing...  I don't know how to tell you this.  What?  I'm doing porn movies.  No.  Yes?  No.  Mom?  No.  Why?  It's too late.  No.  Mom?  No.  Um, I'll...  You, hold on.  Okay. 
[03:15:30]  Oh, my God.  Holy Jesus, I think she believes you.  I'm shaking.  Michelle?  Yeah?  Where can I reach you?  Um, I have, I have like three days to get out of here, so I...  You don't do that.  What?  Don't do what you told me.  Well, what am I going to do?  How am I going to get home?  You don't have money in the bank?  Well, yeah, but I kind of had to use some of it to get this rolling.  I had to get an agent.  No, you don't.  Where, where can I call you?  The same number, but mom... 
[03:16:00]  What?  There's something else I have to tell you.  Happy Mother's Day.  I love you.  This is just a joke.  I'm on the radio.  Oh, my God.  It's a radio program.  Oh.  I just wanted to let you know that I love you.  Oh, my God.  I'm thinking about you.  Mom?  You know, I think those things are so funny when they happen to other people.  I mean, I would sit and listen to them all day long because they're so funny, but that...  You killed me.  Oh, my God. 
[03:16:30]  Mom?  Wait, Mom.  We're really nice.  Okay.  I am going to kill you.  I love you.  Wait, wait, Mom.  Mom, first kill us.  It's Opie and Anthony.  We're at it.  Oh, you guys.  We put her up to it, and...  How...  I got to admit, man.  My heart sunk to my family cast.  Oh, my God.  I felt so bad for you.  I'm breaking out in a sweat here.  I'm thinking that it's too bad.  Happy Mother's Day.  Well, thank you.  Oh, what a mess today. 
[03:17:00]  Bill Burr in studio.  Oh, that chick hates me.  That's crazy.  A lot of calming down going on during the commercial break.  She fell for it, Anthony.  I went out there.  I'm like, look, man.  I don't know what the guy's problem is.  I think you're absolutely stunning and beautiful.  Oh, Greg.  You're selling me out.  And hot.  And I really don't think you're drunk at all.  I don't really know what the deal is.  And then Bill's like, yeah, man.  We don't know what's wrong with him.  I think he got audited or something.  He said it was tax week. 
[03:17:30]  You were going through a lot of stress.  Yeah.  Well, obviously.  And then Jim gets in on the conversation.  So we were all, like, you know, calling her and making her feel good.  So they're going to come back in.  What did you say, Jimmy?  Mary, I just said that Mary carries tits.  It's mind-boggling how perfect they are.  I just want to hold them.  I don't even want to suck them.  I want to, like, just feel the weight of them.  Like, you ever see Roots?  How Kunta is held over his head?  That's how I want to hold those breasts.  I want to name them.  All right.  Well, let's get the girls back in. 
[03:18:00]  Let's smooth everything over.  By the way, that girl is drunk.  Yeah, but she's also a 10.  Yeah.  I mean, obviously.  Mary?  Yeah!  Your breasts are real, right?  Yeah.  Because people called in and said they were fake.  Well, then they're liars.  Kick-ass pictures.  If anyone goes to kick-ass pictures, has them.  Jimmy wants to feel them.  No, she won't let me feel them.  She's looking for them.  You know what?  Would you let them do?  Here's what I'm going to do.  After the show, if everyone's nice to my friend, we can have a line-up and we'll all feel them.  Okay.  Ask that when we got to, like, there's a reward for being nice to Tawny. 
[03:18:30]  Be nice to Tawny, Dave.  You can't really go with that carrot on the stick kind of thing.  I know.  She's terrific.  I love me.  Could you at least let Jimmy feel them now?  Because he won't even be able to do the rest of the radio show.  I'm going to honestly have to wait until Tawny feels appreciate.  Just to sign a good faith that that's actually going to do.  She's appreciated.  You know, I was funny because it's a comedy show, right?  Yeah, okay.  It's like a fun show.  Hold on.  Jimmy's going to feel Mary Carrie's boobs.  Oh, my God.  The nicest I've ever felt.  Thank you.  Wow.  They are nice.  I'm 36.  That's the best.  I'm 24. 
[03:19:00]  Wow.  I would have met you 10 years ago.  Now, you're cute now.  Honestly, we're here until Sunday.  We're hosting a party tomorrow night in New Jersey at a club called Level 9.  And then Tawny and I on Saturday will be at Brazil in the Hamptons.  Appreciate that.  Everybody come here.  It's like a porn star party.  I want you guys all to come.  I'm already horny right now.  Because I've been drinking.  Whenever I drink, I'm horny.  You really?  She knows.  Trust me.  Yeah, she's always horny.  Really?  Do you guys ever fool around together?  No.  No, not really.  We just lay in bed together.  We're like boyfriend and girlfriend, but we use guys for sex. 
[03:19:30]  Do you ever let boys kiss your hiney?  That's a very good question.  I'm not really into the butt stuff.  How about your thighs?  I just want to have a penis and get fucked.  Way to cut to the chase.  There you go.  How about that foreplay stuff?  Skip the foreplay.  She knows, right?  All right.  Well, we got Tawny back in the studio.  Everyone okay now?  Everything's great.  I was just excited.  I wanted to read the news.  I wanted her to, and she didn't want to.  Well, let's get Tawny on the microphone a little bit.  I think Tawny just, maybe there was a little misunderstanding between me and her because I was, you know, 
[03:20:00]  talking about, you know, it was just a comedy thing, you know, trying to be funny again.  But at her expense.  Well, not at her expense.  It's just, you know, you know, oh, look, look, we have a little girl action going on.  But, you know, I understand if some people, you know, because some people are a little sensitive about drinking issues,  things like that.  I'm an alcoholic and proud.  Very good.  There you go. 
[03:20:30]  Hey, was Tom Green a good bang, Mary?  You know, honestly, I only gave him a blowjob.  God, you're a good sport.  That's it.  Yeah, yeah, no, I didn't want to text the person.  Was he with Druitt at the time?  No, he wasn't.  While I was, like, going down, I was like, yeah, this is so good.  Was he packing?  It's, like, okay.  It's a perfect size, I think.  I don't like him really big.  Like, six and a half inches is perfect for me.  Yeah.  It's too big hurts.  You know, it, like, breaks your kidneys or something.  I don't know.  Breaks your kidneys.  It's definitely hitting something when you go that deep.  Do you ever bang Max Hardcore?  Oh, no, I don't really into porn, guys. 
[03:21:00]  Well, Anthony was in the middle of saying something.  I like NBA players.  That's my thing.  Yeah, definitely.  That seems like they would be big, though.  You know, some are, some aren't.  Yeah.  All right, Tawny.  She's seen me have sex with a couple NBA players.  Tawny's all happy, and she's drinking some Star Wars coffee.  Really, Tawny's been in the same room?  Yeah, we've been in the same room having sex a couple times.  A lot.  Yeah?  Really?  Yeah, I've seen a lot of passes.  Wow.  I bet.  Really?  Oh, boy.  Mary's going at it. 
[03:21:30]  Tawny's at the minibar.  Yeah!  You are at the minibar.  We've raided the place.  This one Timberwolf, this one guy on the basketball team, he got us a room in a hotel, and it was  like, you know, he was paying for incidentals.  Big mistake on his part.  Oh, gosh.  He walks in the room next day after leaving us.  There's like 20, you know how room service, they give you like the silver plates?  Yeah.  We ordered like 10 grilled cheese sandwiches, and we had food everywhere.  The minibar was empty, our clothes were everywhere, like potatoes just on the floor, empty little  like bottles all over the floor.  He walked in, what does he say? 
[03:22:00]  This is not professional.  Oh, man.  He looks around our hotel room, he's like, we need to get another room.  What player?  What player was it?  What player was it?  Andy Eby.  He's on the Timberwolves.  He's a rookie out of high school.  Wow.  Hey, Rob from Indianapolis wants to smooth things out.  Hey, Rob.  Rob.  What's going on?  What's up?  Hi, Rob.  Hey, Tony.  You sound pretty hot, but you also sound like a drunk cunt.  Jesus, dude.  What is that?  Oh, my God.  What's up, Maverick? 
[03:22:30]  Why would you call and say that?  You know, some of the callers.  He's supposed to filter those, man.  I got to apologize, because this is a very uncomfortable moment right now.  Oh, it's not.  That was a call.  That's not us.  They met Mary.  They met Mary, Tony.  They met Mary.  That's a guy.  They must have gotten us mixed up.  That's a guy.  That's a guy over the air, though.  They got us mixed up.  Tony.  Tony, they got us mixed up.  I'm the drunk one.  They just mixed up our names.  They just mixed up our names.  I'm a drunk cunt.  Mary's a drunk cunt.  I can't look.  Tony, it's a thing.  Why is she crying?  It was just a stupid phone call. 
[03:23:00]  Tony, they met me.  They met Mary with drunk.  Look, you stupid callers.  It's not like...  Tony.  That was...  Oh, no.  I feel bad.  That was the only...  I feel bad.  That was the only caller.  That was it.  Stupid caller.  You jerk.  They met me, I'm sure.  Caller.  Jerk.  Don't you guys think the callerman Mary's a drunk cunt?  No, no, no, no.  Jerk.  Oh, my God.  Wait, Mary, she's leaving.  No, Tony, come back.  Tony, come back.  Tony, please come back.  Tony, they're joking.  Tony, please come back.  It was a stupid caller.  It was a stupid caller.  Stupid caller.  Some caller. 
[03:23:30]  Come on, show them you're not drunk.  Jesus.  Who let the caller in?  Stupid caller.  Serious questions only.  What's wrong with you people?  Yeah, you callers.  Come sit down.  We got two real...  You don't look bad.  Baby, there's nothing wrong with being drunk.  Don't be mad at us.  We have sex on camera.  It's way worse than being drunk, trust me.  Tony, tell that caller how you feel.  Having sex on camera is way worse than being drunk.  Tell that fucking caller who's boss.  Tell them off.  Spend this fucking thing.  Tell them off.  Tony, come on.  Come on, Tony.  Let them have it.  Come on.  Call them a dick bag.  We got two really hot porn stars in the studio.  Tell them you're a loser. 
[03:24:00]  We want only serious questions.  Call them a dick bag.  Oh, my God.  What's wrong with you people?  Seriously, Tony, being a little drunk in the morning, there's nothing wrong with that.  It's much worse having sex on camera.  It's much worse having sex on camera.  Honestly, I mean, if it was like, if you had to, I mean, okay, if I was to go to, like,  if I was going to have it in a, like, name or sin, and I could choose between, like,  having sex on camera or being drunk in the morning, I would definitely go to being drunk  in the morning.  You know what I mean?  I know what you're saying.  So, it's like.  All right, hold on.  Listen, listen.  Tony's back.  She had a good comeback there.  Yes.  Thank you.  And we're all, everything's okay. 
[03:24:30]  I know what?  Stop whining.  The guy that just called and he wants to, he's calling back to apologize.  Only nice calls, please.  No, it says in the, in the booth that the guy's calling back to apologize.  He was just trying to be wacky for the show.  Rob?  Yeah.  Hey, Rob.  Hey, uh, I'm sorry.  Not you.  Thanks.  Cut.  It's Mary.  Not you.  All right.  Huh?  Timing stinks, stupid.  That was awful.  What an awful caller.  He apologized.  What an awful caller.  All right, where were we?  I'm sorry about that. 
[03:25:00]  Wasn't he from, like, Indiana?  I don't know.  He was from Indiana or something, right?  Jesus.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Yeah, what do you expect there?  Pacers.  Yeah, they don't have a good team, right?  Indiana Pacers.  I've had sex with the Pacers.  Reggie Miller, probably.  Point guard.  Point guard, that would be, uh.  Can't say.  White guy.  Rick Smith.  No, you like the black guy.  No, I'm just kidding.  I never really had sex on me.  That's all there.  One of the Pacers.  You're such an...  Yeah, you did.  No, no, we can't say anything.  We got married.  Wow.  What does it rhyme with?  Wait, you're so emotional.  That's kind of sad.  No, no, you had sex with somebody.  You just don't have to say his name.  Hey, why don't you guys...  Well, tell her who it is.  Wait, wait.  Yeah, tell us.  Take the headphones off. 
[03:25:30]  Take the headphones off.  I really, honestly, this one's the one I can't because...  Take the headphones off.  I really, honestly, this one's the one I can't because I have a big mouth.  This one I really can't say.  Yeah, she can't say.  This one is...  It's on her ex-boyfriend.  Look, there's a guy named Spicknick that wants to...  Ah, Spicknick.  I like that.  Ah, Spicknick.  I'm changing my name to Mary Spicknick.  Shh, shh, shh.  Spicknick, go ahead.  I just had a question.  It seems like she's got a problem with booze.  Is it because she has to wash that smell of whiskey off her little twat when she was little?  Fucking poor.  Jesus, what is wrong with you?  Why are these people...  Oh, you know, who is he?  This is... 
[03:26:00]  What's the matter with you?  I'm appalled.  I'm appalled, by the folks.  They must mean me.  They mean Mary, not Tawny.  Tawny, they mean me.  They mean me.  It's okay, Tawny.  They're just saying that I am...  Not you, Tawny.  They're mixing up Mary and Tawny.  Yeah, they don't know you.  They know that I'm the drinker, not you, Tawny.  How about a nice call?  Can we have a nice call, please?  Mary Carey is the drinker, not Tawny.  Two of the hottest porn stars in the business in here.  Treat them with respect.  Mary Carey and Tawny Rock.  Tawny, they mean me.  They mean me, not you.  Alex, what's up, Alex?  Hey, these stupid cunts, they make Pamela Anderson look like Professor Anthony. 
[03:26:30]  I'll cancel my XM subscription if you ever have them back on here again.  Punch it out.  You ladies.  What are you trying to say?  Oh, my God.  That was rude.  I think if I took an IQ test with Pamela Anderson, I'd probably win.  It's probably because you didn't give us enough info on the arrest the other day, I think.  I think that people are looking for more information on your arrest here.  Mary.  Mary.  Mary.  Mary Carey.  Mary.  I know that's fine.  I'd like to take an IQ test with Pamela Anderson.  That'd be a great challenge. 
[03:27:00]  All right.  Want to read the news?  I don't have hepatitis C.  I'm smart enough not to use Tommy Lee's needles or penis or whatever she does.  That's a good point.  All right.  Matt on Long Island.  Matt.  That's actually a great point.  Maybe it's time for a little Motley Crue challenge except we put the dildo in these  cunts' mouths.  Why are you guys using the C-word?  The C-word's really big today.  I mean, I love the cunt word.  They love using that word.  You fucking cocksuckers.  You bastards.  You know.  No, honestly, cunt is one of my favorite words, I gotta admit.  I think it's the funniest sounding word. 
[03:27:30]  Our duo act, we're heartbreakers, but we're thinking of calling ourselves the crazy cunts.  Really?  Like with the K's out, like K-R-Z-Y and K-U-N-T-Z.  That would be K-B-A-R-D.  But unfortunately, a lot of clubs couldn't run it in their newspaper ads coming to town, so  they didn't do heartbreakers.  How long have you smelled K-U-N-T-Z?  That's what I was saying, crazy cunts with K's, yeah.  With Z at the end, but you can't do it.  No, you just can't do that.  Because it sounds phonetically, it's still the same.  Who's the guy in the Seattle Manor?  It's called Rusty Cunts.  K-U-N-T-Z.  Yeah, we were going to go with those crazy cunts.  Yeah, all right.  Well, why don't we get...  Drunk, sluts, crazy cunts. 
[03:28:00]  Why don't we get back to the news and see what happens here?  Okay, are we on the...  We're on the third one.  Well, Tawny was going to read, right?  No.  Let me read one and J-T-L.  Tawny, you do the one.  Just do the news.  You both did the news together.  That's what you have for it.  I don't need any more worried comments, no.  Honestly, I think you should redeem yourself and show us my name.  No, but go ahead.  Okay, I'll read the next one and maybe she'll read after me.  She is an emotional wreck.  Here's the idea, you guys.  I'm going to read the next story.  What's the matter?  Somebody was very rude to her.  You know what?  I understand, but you know something?  You got to kind of realize that there's going to be assholes that call up. 
[03:28:30]  Yeah, so fight back.  Just, you know, fight back.  If they call up, call them, you know.  Look at Britney Spears.  Whenever you're in the spotlight, people are going to target you.  That's right.  They're in the spotlight right now and they're just jealous.  You should read the news.  Okay, I'll read one and maybe after I read it, she'll want to read one.  There you go.  Is that a good deal?  Yeah.  I'm going to try one and it'll see how I do.  No, just fucking read it.  Okay, I'm going to try one.  Maybe we'll do one next.  Okay.  All right.  Amy Fisher's middle-aged husband dropped a dime on the former Long Island Lolita,  phoning police because she became loud and abusive in an argument over her 17-year-old stepson. 
[03:29:00]  Sources told the post yesterday.  Quiet.  That was a bad job.  I just did a really bad job.  Wait a minute.  You can definitely top me.  Try it.  Stop.  All right, yeah, let's get Tawny reading a little bit.  Tawny, do it too.  Let's do the news together.  Oh, I have an idea.  You read a sentence, I do a sentence.  There you go.  You go first.  Go.  All right, here we go.  Tawny, reading.  Las Vegas Star Academy Award nominee Jesse Kane has failed for divorce from his wife, Linda. 
[03:29:30]  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  That was bad.  Hold on.  Recap is Las Vegas.  It was fine.  What's wrong with it?  Sorry, the couple.  Yeah, it was fine.  No, go ahead.  No, no, fine.  I didn't want to read.  It was fine.  That was fine.  What's wrong with you?  You just read it fine.  That was the news.  That's what you're doing.  It was fine.  You're really good.  Go from the couple.  Yeah, there you go.  Better than Mary.  You're drunk.  Yeah, better than me.  Way better.  Go.  Way better.  The couple was wed 10 years ago in October 1995.  James and Linda have two children from Miss Matters, Jacob, six, and James, Jr., nine. 
[03:30:00]  There you go.  Beautiful.  That was great.  There you go.  It wasn't bad at all.  See those callers we're drinking.  I think she's better than me.  I was too slurred because she's the next one.  She did fine.  I'm too drunk.  I'm too drunk.  You go.  Yeah, do one more.  One more.  You go.  One more for Tawny.  Hong Kong Chinese men have no reason to interfere about the size of their penis, according to  a Hong Kong study which showed local men measured up to the others elsewhere in the world below 
[03:30:30]  the belt.  Yeah, there you go.  There you go.  Asian men with big penises, girls, what?  What's the deal with that?  Oh, wait, there's more.  Our conclusion is that Hong Kong people are no smaller than Western men.  Where their penises are concerned, said Chong Long White.  What do I spell white?  Chong Long White?  Right.  Director of the Ocrology Center at the Union Hospital who headed to... 
[03:31:00]  Who headed to study.  Oh, wait, there's more.  God, this is a long fucking sentence.  There has always been the myth that Westerns have bigger penises and their ability is better.  Sexual ability is better.  There's more.  I agree with Hong Kong.  She can't be a long one.  But you're good.  You're doing good.  Way better than me.  I agree with scientists in Hong Kong who spent five years in October last year measuring 
[03:31:30]  140 Chinese volunteers aged between 23 and 93.  Sounds drunk.  Don't laugh me out of me.  No, keep the voice using again.  What?  Dude.  The average length of their flaccid...  Flaccid?  Oh, boy.  We lost there again.  Penises of 8.46 centimeters, which compare favorably with similar studies on other men overseas.  Germans have average lengths of about 8.6 centimeters. 
[03:32:00]  10 centimeters, Israelis, 8.3 centimeters, Turks, 7.8 centimeters, and Filipinos, 7.35 centimeters.  Italians were the longest.  What about the black people?  There's definitely...  Yeah, they didn't get into Zimbabwe with this one.  And Americans were 8.8.  No, definitely Americans are not 8.0 centimeters.  Yeah, probably.  Tony, dispel this whole rumor that's going on.  Here, you go from this part on.  No, you did better than me.  I said sense of Peters. 
[03:32:30]  I'm the drunk one.  Trust me.  Go ahead.  Tony's starting to get...  I'm the drunk one.  Tony's getting her confidence back.  Let's go on easier.  Come on, Tony.  It said it not measure the penises when they were erect.  It found that a man's height borne no...  Drunk.  I didn't say it.  Dude.  He said it.  No, I'm the drunk one.  They're confusing us.  They're probably blind.  Just keep going.  Drunk whore.  Dude, what are you doing?  Don't look at me.  What the fuck, man?  Seriously?  Opie. 
[03:33:00]  Dude, you're going to blow this and they're going to watch...  You guys, don't look at me.  They mean me, not you, Tony.  They mean me.  That was not me.  Don't you guys mean me?  You mean Mary Carey, right?  That's what they're saying.  It's him.  It's Mary Carey.  They're fucking me.  Honestly.  Opie.  Anthony.  She saw you all day.  You guys, they mean I'm a drunk whore, not you.  No.  Don't you guys mean me?  No, we didn't say it, man.  They mean I'm a drunk whore.  I didn't say it at all.  Useless twine.  No, it was her.  It was him.  I'm not even near the mic.  You guys, you guys...  I'm not even near the mic.  Tony, they mean me, not you.  And no one's saying anything.  She's doing a good job. 
[03:33:30]  I think she should continue reading it.  I'm drunk her.  Absolutely she's doing a good job.  You're not making me?  I'm drunk her.  What do you mean?  She's not drunk, is she?  I haven't even said anything.  You know what?  I think she's doing a great job.  Absolutely.  It seems that if someone gets older and fatter, his blood vessels change, so the penile size  is not static.  It may be a reflection of the condition of the person's blood vessels.  Chan, Chan.  Jeez, I might be thrown under the bus.  Chan said, adding to this, could spear...  Huh?  Wow.  What did you read?  What did she know? 
[03:34:00]  What did she...  What's the line?  Let me have her reread it.  Read this paragraph.  Go.  Read this paragraph.  It seems that someone gets older and fatter.  His blood vessels.  His blood vessels.  Shh.  The drunk's trying to read.  Dude.  Take the mic away from him.  Whose face do I have to spin it?  Take the mic away from you.  Can you let her read?  Just read it.  Fuck them and show them how good you are.  Read the fucking...  That's exactly right.  Kick their asses.  Dude, she sees you saying it.  You guys, honestly, you guys, one moment of silence, let her read the note. 
[03:34:30]  That's the occasion.  Everyone quiet.  Go.  It seems that someone...  I can't...  No, you're doing a good job.  You're doing fine.  No, you do better than me.  You could call me a fucking drunk.  I'm not...  Can you guys, honestly, it's gonna be that bad of it.  Just let me read it.  Yeah.  Just read it.  Honestly.  So, she's got a conference back.  It seems that someone gets older and fatter.  His blood vessels change, so the penis size is not static.  It may be a reflection of the condition of the person's blood vessels.  What an alcoholic.  Shem says...  Anthony, you gotta stop, dude. 
[03:35:00]  Anthony, you gotta stop.  It's not me.  Dude, it's not funny.  I am looking.  I am watching her read, and I'm not saying a word.  And I'm being hung out to dry.  Dude, none of us are saying that stuff.  You know what?  Look, you know what?  I think Tawny did a great job reading.  Anthony, the rest of us have...  I've never seen him be like this.  The rest of us have looked past her alcoholism.  I think you can, too.  I mean, listen for why.  Yeah, seriously.  Honestly, Tawny Roberts isn't an alcoholic, and we don't appreciate that.  Here, you know what, Tawny?  Show him his boss and get this right.  No, I'm not reading anymore. 
[03:35:30]  Okay, fine.  Tawny.  They really think you're smart.  They know.  Well, Anthony.  Way to go, Anthony.  Way to go.  What?  Killed another segment.  You have to accuse her of being drunk.  No, I don't.  Only the drunk ones.  But she is not a drunk one.  I am.  I haven't said that.  I haven't talked to him.  Well, Mary's a little tipsy.  Yeah, you can tell Mary's a little tipsy.  I'm tipsy and proud.  I'm just wondering why, Tawny, like, if you did have a couple, would you say, yeah, I had  a couple?  Yeah, but just give you the right to fucking make fun of me. 
[03:36:00]  I just not give you the right.  Okay, every time I'm reading something, somebody says, oh, the drunk.  I know.  Okay, that's why I'm making fun of you.  The only reason they're making fun of you is because you won't admit it.  It's like, no, you're not admitting it.  Why don't you guys have a private conversation?  Yeah, how about it?  Take the headphones off so no one can hear us.  That's right, exactly.  Okay.  No, just go.  No, maybe it's like something.  They're just saying you're drunk because you're saying you're not, like, if you admit  to it.  No, I...  But here's the thing.  Because you're getting...  I don't care.  Wait, don't let them...  Shit-faced.  Because you're getting agitated, that's why they're egging it on. 
[03:36:30]  But if you show them you don't care.  I don't care.  I don't care.  If you're like, I'm a drunk slut and proud, they won't bother you because it's not funny  then.  But it's funny when you get mad at them.  So basically, I want you to go on air and just be like, I'm a drunk slut and I'm proud.  We'll do it together on Calendary.  Ready?  Let's do it.  Yeah, you're reading.  All right, what's going on over there?  What's happening?  Okay, I'm going to tell you guys...  I just had a private conversation with her.  All right.  And we have a game plan.  Let's show them on the count to me.  I'm not reading anymore.  No, on the count to me we'll say, I'm a drunk slut and proud.  Ready?  One, two, three.  I'm a drunk slut and I'm proud.  I knew it. 
[03:37:00]  Yeah, we all knew it.  See, I knew this was worse.  See, now they're not going to make fun of you anymore because you admit it.  The joke's over.  The joke's over.  Don't work funny.  All right, very good.  Let's go to Rich in Philly.  Rich, let's all listen to Rich.  Yeah, I was wondering about Tanya.  It's Tawny, sir.  It's Tawny.  It's Tawny, Rich.  I'm sorry, Tawny.  I didn't mean to ignore your name.  Give her some respect.  I was just wondering if you drink because you were touched while you were a little girl by your dad.  What?  Her dad's actually a priest.  Bishop.  Bishop.  Well, that's perfect then. 
[03:37:30]  That's a bishop?  Yeah.  For the Mormon church.  So, really?  That's not why you drink?  We drink it.  It's fun.  It's fun to drink.  Yeah.  If you could wake up in the morning and drink and go to work, wouldn't you?  You're a Mormon.  Isn't Bella Donna a Mormon, too?  Yes, she is.  Wow.  All right.  Well, that's okay.  So, you drink a lot.  It's no big deal.  That is a beautiful Mormon girl.  See, that's so cool.  You guys are Mormon.  I came from two retarded parents, and you guys are Mormon.  Gorgeous Mormon girl.  How old a girl are you?  Doing wonderful things with their life.  Yeah.  24.  24?  That's a good age.  Isn't that a good age to be? 
[03:38:00]  Is your dad bummed out that you went in this direction because he's religious?  Of course he is.  Yeah.  Did you talk to me about it or no?  It's like, no, no.  When did you get into it?  About three years, yeah.  Three years ago, at 21.  Yeah.  How did he find out?  Did he accidentally rent one of your tapes or something?  Somebody that I dated from high school actually told him.  What a bastard.  What a cock boy.  Yeah.  What did he say?  What did he say?  I don't know.  They just asked.  They called me up, like, in the middle of the night one night and said,  who's Tawny Roberts? 
[03:38:30]  And I had to explain to him.  Wow.  It wasn't a good situation.  How did you explain that?  Um, they already knew, you know?  So you just said, it's me.  Yeah, exactly.  All right, let's all get naked.  Woo!  What?  Awkward silence.  Should the girls get naked?  We only have two minutes left in the show.  Why is there only two minutes left?  I already got you.  Because you fucking took up too much time with the damn bums.  Huh?  We woke up early to get here.  Like, we woke up early to get here. 
[03:39:00]  We got to plug your stuff, too.  MaryCarrie.com.  Yeah.  Tawny, what's your site?  TawnyRalvis.com.  T-A-W-N-Y or N-E-Y?  T-A-W-N-Y.  JohnnyWalkerRed.com.  Can I spell MaryCarrie for the job?  That's another joke.  Can I spell MaryCarrie for the listeners who don't know how to spell?  Yes, that's a joke.  M-A-R-Y-C-A-R-E-Y.com.  Dot com.  They should make a dot com for all the porn stars, I'm thinking.  Dot com.  Make a dot com for all adult websites.  C-U-M, exactly.  Dot com.  Wouldn't that be hot?  That'd be hot.  Oh, my God.  I should have meant it.  I'm trademarking it now. 
[03:39:30]  Where will you girls be drinking tonight?  Tonight, we don't know.  Tomorrow, we're at Level 9 in New Jersey.  We don't know where, but it's in New Jersey.  What's Level 9?  A bar?  I think so.  And then Saturday, we're at Brazil.  Next week, we're premiering our duo act at Lay Girls in Phoenix, Arizona.  Do you guys have fans in Phoenix, you think?  Oh, yeah.  Okay, Phoenix, Arizona.  Come to Lay Girls and see the two crazy drunk sluts.  Yeah.  From being in there.  One a little drunker than the other.  Well, Mary, of course.  I'm a drunker one, of course, guys. 
[03:40:00]  Seriously?  That's what you mean.  I'm obviously the alcoholic.  Connie, any final thoughts there?  No, I'm good.  Dude, why did you show...  You're not a drunk, I get you.  You can tell them stories.  We fell down one night.  You guys know that story?  Really?  We're standing outside of his nightclub in L.A., and there's paparazzi everywhere.  No, seriously, it's a really funny story.  And we're posing, and all of a sudden, like, literally, we fell backwards to the point  where, like, we were just laying flat on the cement.  We banged...  I banged my head.  Like, it wasn't like we fell a little.  We were just laying dead on the concrete.  Nice backhand, eh?  And just laying there.  Why?  You don't think that's funny?  Is that why you're playing ping pong? 
[03:40:30]  No, dude, she's not drunk.  Tony's...  I don't understand why this whole...  You remember we fell down, right?  Yeah, I do.  You're the one that blacks out all the time.  Oh, really?  I have to tell her what she did the other night.  I have severe blackouts.  I wake up in the morning, I'm like...  She's like, did I fuck last night?  And I have to tell her she fucked somebody or not.  Wow.  That kind of sucks.  This must be proud.  I love this too.  Well, my parents are dead and they're...  Well, my mom's alive, but she's mentally handicapped.  My dad was mentally handicapped.  He's dead.  My grandparents raised me.  Yeah.  How do you think that's funny to you? 
[03:41:00]  Wait, your mom really was mentally handicapped?  She went out on a date with Gary the retard on Howard Stern.  Really?  Yeah.  Your mom?  I said my mom was Gary.  Wait, she's really mentally handicapped?  Yeah, she was...  She was born in the 50s, and then they didn't...  She was adopted by my grandparents, and they didn't test kids the way they do now.  So they think she has fetal alcohol syndrome, and she has slight schizophrenia.  My dad was mentally handicapped, and he was pulled out by, like, tongs or tongs or whatever,  because they knew...  Back then, they didn't know it was bad, and he has a speech impediment.  He would talk like,  Wow, and these two got together?  And when you're a kid, when you're five, you're like, 
[03:41:30]  Oh my God, my dad's scary, you know?  So my grandparents adopted me from my parents.  But your mom had you?  My mom had me.  I was born to two mentally handicapped people.  Wow.  Holy jeepers.  Explains a lot, doesn't it?  Dude, we wasted an hour, and now you get to that little tidbit?  That's a great story.  How did you guys not know that?  It was, like, the first thing I ever did before I was a porn star on Howard.  But anyway, we don't want to talk about it.  Oh, we don't care.  Okay, yeah.  That's a good story.  Yeah, my parents were handicapped.  But when my grandparents raised me, and I had a perfect childhood.  Yeah.  Oh my God! 
[03:42:00]  Oh my God, that's a game.  Yep.  Is that Bibble Bobbles?  No.  Mario?  Mario.  Oh, it's, um...  Oh my God, it's Mario 1 and 2.  Mushrooms and...  Yeah, the shrooms.  Oh my God, I got to the dragon, and I never beat the dragon, ever.  Really?  Wow.  Yeah, you have to jump over the bricks.  It's like, pow, pow.  There's Luigi.  Yeah, Luigi.  Prayed by childhood memories.  Did you ever play those games?  Oh, that's terrific.  Did you ever play those games?  Seven.  Yeah, it's like the...  She played Pong.  Pong was a great game. 
[03:42:30]  I'm playing right now.  Let's just can't see me.  Let's just can't see me, but I'm totally playing right now.  I'm, like, jumping over the mushrooms and the bricks.  Pow.  Wonderful.  Oh, and things fly up, and this guy's like, what?  All right, let's get the alcoholics out of here.  We've had another great...  Hey, hey, don't upset me now, too.  What, I thought we were all having fun here, right?  No.  No?  Are you having fun?  No.  She's not having fun.  Why are you having fun?  She's miserable.  Why are you miserable?  She's not in a good mood.  She's miserable because marycarry.com needs more hits. 
[03:43:00]  Ah, that's when you lose and you die.  I know.  Tawny, uh, final thoughts?  Anything you want to plug?  Website?  Just only have, like, 10 seconds left in the game right now.
