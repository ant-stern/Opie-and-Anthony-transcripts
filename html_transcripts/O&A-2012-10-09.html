<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opened with a scathing critique of Alex Rodriguez's and Derek Jeter's performances for the New York Yankees, using highly offensive language to describe their perceived lack of effort and frequent strikeouts.  This transitioned into a call from Travis, a Baltimore Orioles fan, who recounted a humorous play from an Orioles-Yankees game and discussed his (lack of) plans to attend future games and his wife's birthday. The conversation then veered into NFL discussions about the New York Jets and Tim Tebow, followed by a lengthy segment on the presidential election, specifically focusing on the Obama campaign's ad mocking Mitt Romney's proposed cuts to PBS funding. The hosts discussed the PBS president's salary and their opinions on public television funding.  A jarring shift occurred with the playing and reaction to an audio recording of Jerry Sandusky denying the accusations against him, punctuated by extremely graphic and offensive language from the hosts. The show concluded its first major section with a lengthy, highly critical discussion of psychic mediums, featuring clips of a Long Island Medium and a debunking segment from *The Amazing Randi* with Bob Barker, all accompanied by offensive terms from the hosts.

A subsequent segment revisited the topic of debunked psychics, detailing James Heidrich's psychic test failure on "That's My Line," his subsequent conviction for molesting five boys, and the hosts' criticisms of David Blaine. This segued into "Jacktober," a segment reviewing bad radio moments, specifically focusing on the Charleston, South Carolina morning show "Two Girls and a Guy."  This included playing a clip about a regrown ear,  highly offensive and graphic descriptions of the show's Facebook page (containing racist and sexually explicit images), and a critique of a poorly acted phone scam from the same show, culminating in a bizarre "butt plug" prank call before introducing guests Bob Kelly and Joe DeRosa.

Bob Kelly and Joe DeRosa joined the show to promote their book, "Cheat." The segment began with Kelly's poorly received rap and a discussion of a disturbing penis-shaped birthday cake. The conversation meandered through their book tour experiences (including an uncomfortable encounter on Red Eye), the financial realities of book publishing, Kelly's earwax removal, the hosts' hair removal habits, an upcoming supersonic skydive, and the upcoming Jerry Sandusky sentencing.  Jimmy, a show staffer, recounted a disappointing near-miss meeting with Muhammad Ali, only to have it rescheduled the next day.  The segment ended with the hosts checking their book's Amazon ranking and reading endorsements.  Vulgar language and crude humor were prevalent throughout.

A further segment heavily featured Jimmy's eventual meeting with Muhammad Ali, describing Ali's stiffness and his wife's conversational skills.  This segued into bizarre tangents about a "cancer girl" with a patchy beard, Katie Lang's appearance, and speculation about Jimmy having an AIDS app. The hosts again promoted "Cheat," discussing reactions to the book and jokes about infidelity.  A viral video of "Stone Cold E.T." at White Castle was shown.  A story about Jimmy's 911 call about a possible bus hijacking was recounted, followed by a story about a gift of Beatles books given to Ozzy Osbourne that was left behind.  This segment unexpectedly concluded with an in-studio visit from Stanley Tucci, leading to a brief discussion about his cookbook and a concern about a potential scheduling conflict.


The final segment of the show involved a rambling, vulgar conversation amongst the hosts and possibly a guest, Josh.  Topics included the book publishing process (and a humorous anecdote about transcribing Jim Norton's speech), Jim Norton's Netflix special and website woes, physical comedy (including a request for a chest tickle), inappropriate photos from Joe DeRosa, personal anecdotes (a drone incident, encountering someone in a dress, and various character impressions), and the impending transition to Sam Roberts' show, with playful tension and negotiation about airtime and format.  The segment was characterized by extreme profanity, sexual innuendo, and a casual, highly informal tone with frequent interruptions and tangents.

[00:16:30]  yeah  she makes six hundred thirty two thousand dollars a year  damn  wow  i don't think taxpayer money  subsidizing yeah  of course  632  wow  i mean it should be supported by viewers like you  wow  that's where our money goes  exactly  damn  the fucking  amalgamated  fucking  intertech  global  but i'll say that that's that's a lot of money but to run a network it's not  like to that's  public broadcasting  it's public broadcasting  our network head though that's not a lot of money at all 
[00:17:00]  they  makes more than that the president of npr  but what does he make  over a million  jesus  what does an average network head make like the head of say  fifty thousand  oh see i would have thought it was more  my mistake  but when you get like that's a tremendous amount of money  yeah but when it comes to public funding man that's a that's a high salary  you gotta think  yeah  yeah  i'll do it for half  yeah no kidding i bet you there's a bunch of people that would do it for half  what  there's an average  oh  what happened

[00:19:30]  and it was like aww  right until the throat gets ripped out  next fucking second  he he he  oh god  yeah wow  i think i i just saw  how sandusky sentencing is today  oh yeah yeah  and the headline is  could get anywhere from 10 to 400 years  you know it's fucked up  he uh he's blaming the fucking victims  no  he's like  like outspokenly blaming the victims  they're lying  everyone lied  penn state lied 
[00:20:00]  the psychologists  everyone  it was a big  a vast conspiracy  he said he's only had sex with his wife  i i just  i i really  this is because it was probably  he has kids right  uh yeah  this is all about  this is the same as i  what i believe that scumbag  uh  who's that that larry craig guy  i i i personally  probably the same situation  the the foot tap guy  foot tap guy  yeah yeah  i think it's the same thing with it  foot tap guy  they're fucking families  and the and they can't look their sons in the eye  and they can't look their wives in the eye 
[00:20:30]  right  so they just keep it going  yeah yeah yeah keep the light going  i'm responding to the worst loss of my life  first i looked at myself  over and over i asked  wait this is actually sandusky  yeah  oh yeah  i thought someone was gonna read this shit for him  when did he make this  last night  last night he recorded this  oh okay  i thought it was something he wrote and then somebody else uh transcribed it or whatever  he recorded it for the penn state college radio station  what  like he recorded it  why not for our station  he's doing liners  what the fuck 
[00:21:00]  what the fuck we can't get stanley tucci and they're getting fucking  or ethan hawk  or ethan hawk  and they're getting a jerry sandusky fucking exclusive  they got these  on college radio  psu  publicists are scared  hey you gotta take microquering  in between feed  you gotta take microquering  no you gotta take Gary Glitter  Pete Townsend wants to come in  he's writing a book  he's doing research  Gary Glitter 
[00:21:30]  i'm responding to the worst loss of my life  first i looked at myself  over and over i asked why  why didn't we have a fair opportunity to prepare for trial  why have so many people suffered as a result of false allegations  oh my god  it's a purpose  maybe it will help others  some vulnerable children who could be abused  might not be as a result of all the publicity  that would be nice  but i'm not sure about it  i would cherish the opportunity to become a candle for others  as they have been a light for me 
[00:22:00]  that's okay  they can take away my life  they can make me out as a monster  they can treat me as a  fucking cool  dripping wax into a young  to a young eager mouth  oh what a piece of garbage this guy is  it is really horrid  denial  they can take away my life  they can make me out as a monster  they can treat me as a monster  but they can't take away my heart  in my heart  i know i did not do these alleged disgusting acts 
[00:22:30]  my wife has been my only sex partner  and that was after marriage  our love continues  oh  what a young man who is dramatic  a veteran accuser  and always sought attention  started everything  oh  he was joined by a well orchestrated effort  of the media  investigators  the system  penn state  psychologists  civil attorneys  and other accusers  he just keeps naming people  yeah  i've wondered  the police department  uh... the cia  alan dulles  and uh... robert mcnamar 
[00:23:00]  Mark Furman  yeah  Mark Furman  Chris Darden  they planted a bloody anus  yeah  they never should have  i tried to get them to  let me put my penis in  it doesn't fit  it doesn't fit  you see the kid  he screamed  and his head went back  into the left  is there an outtake of this  where he just starts laughing  yeah  yeah  oh boy  let's do that again  they won  i've wondered what they really won 
[00:23:30]  attention  financial gain  prestige  will all be temporary  before you blame me  as others have  look at everything  and everybody  look at the preparation for the trial  and the trial  compare it to others  think about what happened  why  and who made it happen  you  evaluate the accusers  and their families  realize they didn't come out of isolation  the accusers were products of many more people and experiences than me  look at their confidence and their honesty 
[00:24:00]  think about how easy it was for them to turn on me  given the information attention and potential perks  i never labeled or put down them or their families  i tried and i cared  then asked for the same  please realize all came to the second mile because of issues  some of those may remain  oh  we will continue to fight  we didn't lose to proven facts  evidence  accurate locations and times  oh my god  anything can be said  we lost the speculation and stories that were influenced by people who wanted to convict me 
[00:24:30]  we must fight unfairness  inconsistency  and dishonesty  i believe  we will need to be portrayed for who they really are  oh this whole thing's a big conspiracy  i know i've been the victim of it  they actually went in there when i was sleeping and took my cum  and smeared it all over the inside of his colon  oh shit  i said i didn't do nothing  i was just minding my beeswax  how did your blood get inside 
[00:25:00]  how did his blood get inside your pee hole mr hoggis  i'm like it was planted there  another conspiracy  yes it was  just like sandusky  sure someone else must have done it  because he can't stand up on his own yet  i don't know who took  who took his blood and put it inside my pee hole  mr hoggis his fecal matter was inside your urinary tract  pack of lies 
[00:25:30]  god bless jerry sandusky  he didn't do nothing  yeah very convincing  sure sometimes they would even dress up like ladies  how am i supposed to know they're fooling me  sure  then they pulled a wig off  god god god god god god  god you little trickster  people need to be portrayed for who they really are  we've not been complainers  when we couldn't have kids we adopted  when we didn't have time to prepare for a trial 
[00:26:00]  we still gave it our best  we will fight for another chance  we have given many second chances  and now we'll ask for one  it will take more than our effort  justice will have to be more than just a word  fairness be more than just a dream  it will take others  somebody apolitical with the courage to listen  to think about the unfairness  to have the guts to stand up and take the road less traveled  i ask for the strength to handle everything  and the willingness to surrender only to god 
[00:26:30]  regardless of the outcome  there you go  he's going away forever  yeah that's a  that ain't gonna make any difference  that's not a very good um  no  that was kind of a slam dunk  case  yeah  yeah  sorry  although the only thing you think of is mcmartin preschool  oh boy  in uh  but those were children  yeah  that were testifying falsely  yeah  like but that was a  a fucking  these innocent people went to jail  but these are older people  and that  believe me  that whole fucking shower episode 
[00:27:00]  is right  enough right there  if you ask me  yeah  there's this  the witness  the fucking  uh  other allegations  that just  he  he just comes across like that  he can't defend himself  weren't there like voicemails  and love letters  oh right  and he said something to the investigator  yeah  yeah that's just too much  and he's saying it was just all speculation  when does the sentencing go down today  today yeah  yeah  this morning  oh man it's well speaking of football

[00:29:30]  this vagary  where you could sort of  what  she's coming in or something  no  what happened  can she just sue the shit out of you  put the van halen music on for a second  what happened  let's see  can we take a  break on put that  there  oh that's a good one  i think she's a fraud how about that 
[00:30:00]  all right  i think all these people are frauds  it drives me nuts  is that better  i don't know  are you a little worried really  oh yeah  you're worried that some like  some lady like this that preys on vulnerable people is  legit  no  come here come in here and prove it's legit  i don't 
[00:30:30]  i jim norton  hope that she gets a lump somewhere  because i think she's fucking despicable  fucking despicable  but i don't know if she's a fucking  you know  i think she's a fraud  you're allowed to say that  yeah  right  yeah  i tell you this  these people drive me nuts  shade 45 was freaked the fuck out  they knew she was  why is it  why is it all vague  they get sort of messages from  from heaven  but it's always vague  and they gotta work the room with their vagary  until they fucking pinpoint someone  now how about shade 45  what what did she do 
[00:31:00]  did she read someone in there  she's  grape soda  oh  oh shit  somebody smokes new for us  oh shit  because let me tell you something  if she walked in here  yeah  and or it goes on any show  i'd roll my fucking eyes  first of all she could just google any of our names  right  we've talked about shit on the air  get everything  um i'm detecting um i'm feeling tears  right  uh somebody that just cried incessantly as a child  and your father 
[00:31:30]  yeah yeah  used to say  he used to um evoke the lord's name  in some way  there you go  yes jesus cried  google is the uh is the best friend of the  the medium  the medium  oh  they google shit  they they plant  they've they have planted microphones in the past  i will not mention specific shows  but they plant microphones  so they they pick up on conversations as the crowd is getting  ready for the big show  yeah  i i didn't i know i didn't do this justice yesterday on twitter  i needed a more than 140 characters yesterday 
[00:32:00]  but i was at the gym  me and jim norton's gym  yes  and i was watching uh katie kirk's new show  because it was on  i'm like what the fuck  i'm gonna take a look at this  and this long island medium was on  and then she starts working the crowd  and she actually said  and i'm kind of paraphrasing  i'm feeling someone's  someone's loved one died recently  and then this black woman was like  oh my god me  like she just gives it up  and then of course in an audience like that  someone's loved one died recently  of course 
[00:32:30]  and then this broad goes  i i i'm i'm getting a vision or feeling that you  you might have sung in church  she says this to a black woman  holy shit  isn't that a little um racist  huh  that's racist  huh  the spirit would have been racist then  who told her  the baptists love to sing in church  of course  have you ever gone to a baptist service  they sing  so that's pretty much like  you know  i'm detecting  some fried chicken 
[00:33:00]  and watermelon  sure  it's it's just  you're taking a racial stereotype  and i'm kind of yelling at the tv  because katie kirk  i know she's been  like a kind of a fluff lady  with the today show and stuff  but she also has done some hard news  it's like why aren't you challenging her  instead of allowing this crap to go on on your show  yeah  why not at least challenge her go  really you're you're you're feeling that a black woman might have sung in church before  yeah  and then the next one was  i'm also uh feeling a tattoo  a tattoo  someone with a tattoo 
[00:33:30]  and everyone's like  getting up on their seat like  i got a tattoo  oh my god  i got one  maybe she's talking about me and my loved one  and then she goes  the tattoo says  in uh  in memory of  does it  how'd she know that  someone saw it  probably  oh  in an audience  i i think it's safe to say  in an audience  you're probably gonna have one person that has a  in memory of tattoo  yeah  and then the next thing she did was something with a  with a gold ring i believe  oh  and then she goes i know that's 
[00:34:00]  i know a lot of people here have a gold ring  but look that's what i'm feeling right now  everyone has  what the fuck is she talking about  and and katie kirk just sat there nodding  like this this uh lady goes  you know when i was uh  when i was a little girl i actually saw the dead people  but that ability went away as i got older  now i just get these fuck  these feelings of the dead people  wow  i hate these people  i get it  so you got a clip from the show  yep  i'm saying this  newly passed  newly for me is within two years 
[00:34:30]  two years  pause  that for you  there's an audience full of people  a newly passed means within the last two years  you got  how many people are in that audience  let's be about  maybe two hundred  no  like a hundred  no that's more than a hundred there travis  let's call it a hundred and thirty  sure we can split the difference  let's call it  it's definitely over a hundred  you got two four six  you got seven per row  one two three four five six  so that's forty two over there  then you got  five four  yeah  all right 
[00:35:00]  it's a little over a hundred  yeah  120 let's call it  she's asking an audience of 120 people  if someone  has passed  135  135  ok  37  alright sure  ok  sure it can  so she goes  someone passed  recently  and that means within the last two years  two years  I would bet half that audience had someone they care about die in the last two years  go ahead  and this woman is huge  and who's the young male that's departed as well 
[00:35:30]  young for me is anyone that left the physical world before we feel their time  it's not  it's so vague  more vagary  so it's young doesn't necessarily mean young it's just before their time  so if you have this incredible ability it has to be vague though  really  so vague  she's disgusting  and this is she's saying  I fucking hate this  I sense that somebody here has had somebody die before they'd like them to have died  within the last two years  holy shit it's a miracle  what are the odds of that 
[00:36:00]  a hundred percent you cunt  her hairstyle looks like a horse's asshole  it really does  she doesn't even have confidence in her bullshit to go with within the last year  it's within the last two years really  she's trying her cold read shit right here  and it's uh  incredible  yeah  yeah  now I  ok  here I go  katie just look at it this way you don't have to go to the gym this afternoon  a little humor with your dead people 
[00:36:30]  my brother-in-law passed away much younger than we expected him to  and what happened with the chest he just like labored my breathing  oh he labored her breathing  wow  yes  yeah he shoved his ghost cock in your fucking mouth  I hope that labored breathing is due to a growing  a growing abnormality on her fucking ovaries  because I also hate her  because  because the  how this works is the people are so like  want to believe and they want to feel like their loved ones are ok  so they offer up all the info  so why doesn't everyone just sit there and go well 
[00:37:00]  hey you're the you're the expert  why don't you come walk up to me  walk up to one of these people and point out which one you're talking about  or they'll make themselves believe that that's what they're talking about  you know what he did at one point  have a little heart thing when he was like 11  well there was another one  I don't know if we're going to get to it today  where it was uh  an older guy's mom passed away  and she goes I feel like you were holding her hand  wow  guess what when old people die  oh brother 
[00:37:30]  if it's not in the middle of the night in  in a car accident guess what you're holding their hand as they pass  yeah  especially if you're leading them out in front of traffic  so you can get that inheritance  there you go  there you go you old fucking burden  your back open hospital johnny  holding the hand away so they can't pull the pillow off their nose  smush it on with the other hand  I sense you were holding her wrist  oh you kind of  yeah well  go ahead  there are bloat to the chest  we don't really know  it was a year and a half  here so 
[00:38:00]  what happened there  I want to talk about  what happened  I want to see that woman who looks like Burt Lahr  finished talking  who lost the father on right here  your father also as well  my mother's husband  see they just offered up  because I  she  by the way she goes right here  and  and the woman talks from way over to the right  yeah yeah yeah  right here in this area  and then no over that area  well I meant over there  I was getting to that area  yeah  well your father  no it was my mother's husband  oh great okay  not a father  no  no  something made me say something 
[00:38:30]  I felt that there was a lot in this row right here and I'm  see it's not up to me on who comes through what they say  what they don't say  and I just felt a lot of devastation within the family  he was  he was my children's only grandfather  and not really  that's devastation  right of course  that would be devastating for anybody  are you the only son  were you the only  because your mother  she just keeps going like this  can we get back to my son  and she's going my son  my son  no she's not  so that's my symbol for someone  this is the only son  or acknowledging the relationship and bond  that you shared  with your mother  what do you think of this 
[00:39:00]  I just lost my mother  and were you there for the  for the actual passing  of course  holding of the hands  and she says  please just tell my son  I want to thank him  for allowing my soul  to leave the physical world  here with dignity and grace  did you tell your mother  it was okay to let go  I  it was so interesting  what you're saying  because I went there the night  before she passed away  and she had a stroke  and she was  almost comatose  and  I kept telling  I love you  you know  I'm here  and all of a sudden  my hand came up 
[00:39:30]  and she wanted to hold my hand  and all of her fingers  except the middle one went down  she told me to get out of her room  she hated me  yes  she hated me  I was a mistake  I was the product  of a home invasion  and a sodomy  in the early 30's  every time she looked at me  she remembered being  thrown down the basement steps  she couldn't wait  to leave this planet  you old hag  you old hag  but yes  I  I hate mediums  because I think they prey  on people's grief 
[00:40:00]  they're disgusting people  if it makes it  I was having a discussion  after I saw the show  and someone was saying  if it makes these people  feel better  what's the harm  in a way  I guess  but I mean  this woman makes  a shit load of money  off bullshitting people  in my  humble opinion  that's what you  that's what you say  if it makes  people feel better  but  because it's lying to them  it's like  um  it's lying  because you're  you're not getting  these messages  I don't think so  you know 
[00:40:30]  back it up  you could say  oh she's lying  but then  there's no way to  prove that she's lying  or that she's telling  the truth  exactly  it's a perfect  carny scam  and because this ability  is sort of vague  and comes and goes  it's easy to kind of  explain that  oh no it's over here  okay it's over here  now  oh right over there  I get it now  sure  sure  you gotta be really good  at reading people's faces  you know what I mean  yep 
[00:41:00]  is there another clip  that was it  little montage  yeah there's another clip  why you're lying  this is why this is her  response to skeptics  it's not her  no let's hear it  fair enough  because a lot of people  don't think this  shit is real  if I could just say something Katie  I mean sure  it's I don't  I look at my gift  from a different perspective  it's not about people  believing in what I do  I say to all my clients  I go listen  I don't care if you believe  I don't mean to be rude  but that's not why  I chose to do mediumship  or more importantly 
[00:41:30]  to do the television show  Long Island Medium  the reason why I chose  to do those things  was to make people  be more aware of  because I believe  you don't have to go to a medium  to speak to your loved ones  I believe what I am able to do  is just be for a split second  be that physical being  to allow your loved ones  to validate  that they are still with you  are there some people  who are more receptive  than others  I mean I kind of think  if you're open to it  there's people who used  to host the evening news  but couldn't quite cut it  you fucking idiots  rubes  well my experience is  I find a skeptic 
[00:42:00]  sometimes gets the best reading  because they are not  expecting anything  so it's the ones that sit there  and go mom  I want you to tell me  where I put your apron  that it's buried under the drawer  and I'm you know  like the woman that buried  the watch in the chair  when I went to go read her  she actually took a pocket watch  and put on  and she wanted them  to talk about that  in a specific movie  that's harder sometimes  what?  I don't know  probably an episode of  yeah I bet  so  whatever  huh?  I ain't buying that shit 
[00:42:30]  no  not for a second  no  Todd Burpo?  not for a second  so  his name Todd Burpo?  no  what a horrible name  why would you say that?  I'm not saying  I'm just reading what  Fred Fartnick said  what about Sylvia Miles  who finds the dead kids?  I don't know about that  she used to be on TV  finding dead kids  if she was such a good medium  she would have known  that Jon Voight wanted money  after he fucked her  in Midnight Cowboy  Jon Voight? 
[00:43:00]  oh yeah?  but who?  oh that's right  she was in that  you were gonna ask me for money?  what does the amazing Randy say?  he offers  I believe it's a million dollar check  for anyone  that can absolutely  withstand his tests  improve real psychic activity  so why wouldn't someone  like the Long Island medium  take him up on that?  no one has been able to do it  that's free money  quick million  plus there would be  headlines all over the world  yep  so why do they avoid those challenges?  huge 
[00:43:30]  none of them have been able to do it  under test conditions  none  none so far right?  zero  has anyone tried?  I don't know  I'm sure they have  but he's been debunking  a lot of these  uh  the way he phrased it  is he is unable  to find evidence  of real psychic  ability  uh  rubber guard fan  she was on Rana Fez  this year  and uh  Red Fez not very successfully  no?  yeah  figures  what was her excuse? 
[00:44:00]  probably cause  the uh  the radioactivity  the radio waves  were just  you know  interfering  and she comes from Long Island  had a lot of cool people come from Long Island  she's an embarrassment  it's also been you know  Joel Rifkin  oh wow  yeah  Colin Ferguson  Colin Ferguson  Joel Rifkin  wait a minute  another reference  those guys were superstars  doesn't it?  it never ends  yeah  they were superstars  superstars 
[00:44:30]  they made their mark  sure did  this hack will be gone  in a couple of years  doing her dumb readings  from her stupid basement again  how do they get shows like that?  oh Katie Korek  I was bummed  I tried to like  get into it a little bit  on Twitter  but I needed more fucking characters  I'm like come on  that's all  you're doing a fluff piece with her  a fucking challenger  yeah  why wouldn't she challenge her  as an ex-media person?  exactly  if that's the kind of  stuff you're doing 
[00:45:00]  with your talk show  you're gonna be another talk show  in trouble  like Jeff Probst  oh god  that Jeff Probst  what's her name  this woman?  Teresa Caputo  Caputo  something like that  what the hell is this guy?  oh  is he trying  psychic stuff on  theory  as yet unproven of course  is that it's accomplished  simply by blowing  though  rather cleverly  I must admit  oh fucking  the amazing Randy  just blows up this guy's spot 
[00:45:30]  what is this one?  it's a long video  oh yeah  who's that?  is that Bob Barker?  uh  in the middle?  looks like  stop him  from turning the page  it says here you see  James Heidrich  perform his miracle  and ten minutes later  fail at the same miracle  when cheating is taken  out of the equation  can we see  can we see the original  look at this guy  let's see the original  what's the original  let's see the original  miracle can we see  it's a long video  unfortunately  the first moment of it  yeah 
[00:46:00]  it's where he put  there's a bunch of paper  well not yet  not the paper yet  now he's doing something  with a pencil on the edge  of a table  I guess his claim is  he can move things  with his mind right?  so why  so that pencils  is pretty much 50%  over the edge of the table  right  and now  so all you would need  is a slight vibration  that thing would  fucking fall  well he's doing some  kind of kung fu-y  looking moves  he's obviously can blow  very very subtly  oh you think that's  what's going on?  yeah I think he blows the 
[00:46:30]  so why does he have to  have the pen halfway  off the table  to make this work?  well it's very difficult  to move things with  your mind so it's got to  be right on the brink  moving  and you just put it  over the edge you know?  thank you for explaining  yeah sure  I'm not smart enough  to understand that  fucking Moe Howard haircut  imagine if his nose  was stuffy  wow  pencil just pivoted  pivoted because it's  on the edge of a table  yes  and there's stupid  Bob Barker 
[00:47:00]  flopping like a seal  does this guy not know  James Randi backstage?  now is it true  that you can also  turn the pages  of this telephone  directory  yes sir  can you do that for us?  I'll try  should I take the pencil  off the table?  yes  oh this guy's hateable  James  would you like to  open it to any page  or should you want me to do it?  I'll be happy  he puts the phone book  on the table  right  how does he blow so quietly  I don't know  that's his whole gimmick  right?  probably through his nose  you think? 
[00:47:30]  sure  now he's gonna  move the page  as I gather  we're waiting  sorry about this  by the way  a phone book  kids is what we used to use  to find phone numbers  yeah  it's a big giant book  way before your  smart phone  an alphabetical order  yeah he's doing all these  hand movements  by the phone book  over dramatizing everything  yeah  oh he's not feeling it  oh boy  he's dramatically  walks away  he walks away  he's gotta gather himself guys  yeah yeah yeah  ready 
[00:48:00]  alright  now he  oh jesus  and then he walks by  he walks right back  and his hand is over it  and the two pages turn  and it turns  yes  now I'm gonna fuck you over  these demonstrations  you did these same demonstrations  on that's incredible  yes it is  and as you know  the amazing Randy maintains  that you did not use psychic power  oh boy  but that it was trickery  and he is prepared  to pay you 
[00:48:30]  ten thousand dollars  back then  yeah  if you can do it  using psychic power  later in our show  you two will meet  head to head  and we will  test your psychic powers  to the nth degree  and I know  oh he looks worried  at home  are not  going to want to miss that  no we're not  Bob Barker  we're not  his face  he's bummed  you literally  couldn't have been sadder  if he said  we have a nostril cam 
[00:49:00]  holy shit  once again  here is the man who claims  to have psychic powers  psychic powers  James Heidrich  he's awful  he's a black karate bee  he's just horrible  What a tool.  Welcome back to our stage.  You did the most impressive demonstration.  Best of blow, this guy is.  See, because he blows on the things.  If you saw it, I'm sure you were impressed.  If you did not, let me explain that...  Fast forward to the same thing.  There's a show in this show.  I don't need a recap.  So then how about you go full screen for us?  All right, here's the amazing Randy meeting all month. 
[00:49:30]  James' demonstration from backstage.  Yes, I did.  And do you accept that as a demonstration of psychic power,  or do you believe that he used trickery?  I don't accept it as a demonstration of psychic power,  Sure, Bob, I think that the solution is rather simple.  I think that Mr. Heydrich is merely to accomplish this effect,  blowing on both the page and on the pencil.  And the guy's standing there like,  Oh, fuck, he's got me.  You originally asked him to demonstrate  in two different ways his psychic power.  Yes.  But as I understand it, 
[00:50:00]  you are now prepared to wave the demonstration with the pencil.  Yes, and the reason is rather simple,  because the pencil reacts to even the currents  of the air conditioning in this studio.  It would be very difficult to try to put controls on it in such a way  that normal currents of air that are present all the time  would not move the pencil.  For example,  Oh!  It moves very, very easily.  Oh!  All right, you're not going to ask him.  He just reenacted it.  He reenacted the pencil thing in two seconds.  You are prepared to pay him $10,000 
[00:50:30]  if he can turn the page of the telephone directory  with certain controls.  Oh, boy.  You have the $10,000, do you, Randy?  I do, indeed.  Oh, he carries it out with him?  Yeah.  I carried this check now for going on 17 years, Bob.  There it is, a check for $10,000.  Oh, so $1,000,000.  Now it is.  Should you be able to successfully perform the demonstration.  This is like 1980.  I would like to introduce...  Oh, this guy's bummed.  Oh, shit.  His face is bummed.  Is a psychologist and professor of parapsychology 
[00:51:00]  at John F. Kennedy University.  What is this show called?  Fuck you?  Dude, who is that fucking face?  ...the great astronomer and...  ...with a lot of instrumentation  to demonstrate that fact  by using one very simple control.  Oh, boy.  Now, let me just emphasize...  Oh, the guy's looking over like,  what's the control?  ...will not stop him  from turning the page of the telephone directly.  That's right.  But you hope to the judge's satisfaction  will demonstrate that he is doing it with his breath.  Oh, boy.  All right.  Oh, look at this guy. 
[00:51:30]  Oh, shit, he's bummed.  What I have here is particles of a white plastic...  Oh, no.  ...which, when given a good puff,  good heavy puff of air,  will, I think, rather conclusively show...  Oh, no.  ...whether or not...  He's surrounded the phone back now  with black styrofoam strips  between genuine...  ...that will move very easily  with air.  But it certainly should be very interesting indeed  to see what now occurs.  But do you maintain  that if the page of the telephone directly turns 
[00:52:00]  that we will see movement  in this styrofoam as well?  I think that it's pretty logical.  We've experimented with it, Bob,  and that's what we have determined  in the experiments.  Oh, man, he fucked him.  Very well.  Are you ready to proceed?  I am indeed.  Judges, you're ready?  Oh, look at his face.  Ready.  Ready.  Ready.  Ready.  Ready.  Ready.  This is why you never heard  from the guy again.  Oh, now he's doing his mumbo-jumbo  with his hands.  Oh, he's thinking like,  can I really do this?  Maybe I can.  And he's not even getting down low 
[00:52:30]  by the phone book, is he?  No, nothing's moving.  Nothing's moving.  Oh, no.  Nothing's moving.  No, it's not moving at all.  Oh, he's doing his magical moves,  but nothing's moving.  Do you know how bad he wants to go?  Can we do this?  Let me get rid of this styrofoam.  It's killing my vibe.  Nothing's moving.  How fucking embarrassing.  Oh, now he's getting down  to the level of the phone book.  Oh, how embarrassing.  He's smiling.  Figure it out right now.  Yeah, he's like,  there's another way I can do this.  Can I do this? 
[00:53:00]  Can I blow on this just enough  without moving the...  Ah, his face just grimaced.  He just went like,  hmm.  Look, it's a tough math problem.  Yeah, yeah.  This guy is fucked right here.  His whole career of being a magical guy.  He's squatting.  He's holding himself up with one hand.  Oh, is he fucking panicking.  He's getting into some dramatic positions,  but it's not going to help him.  He's looking,  trying to figure out  how can I do this  and not move that fucking styrofoam.  Yeah, he hates styrofoam to this day.  Everything he ships breaks 
[00:53:30]  because he refuses to touch styrofoam.  Oh, he shook his head.  Now he walked away.  How many pages?  Just one page.  Once.  All right, now...  This time and once more.  Now he's pacing.  He's asking questions.  James, you had another question.  Mm-hmm.  Take a home.  What would you like to ask?  Okay.  The styrofoam and the lights  form electricity,  which pulls the page.  Look.  It's pulling the page down. 
[00:54:00]  Oh, how great is he?  And then it turns the way  it's supposed to.  Pulls the page down.  No, it's pulling it the right way.  He's holding the page up  and it's turning the proper way.  He's trying to demonstrate  how the page isn't moving.  But it's moving.  Ask Randy to allow you to do  or for me to do.  To either take something else,  either lighter or something  that is going to keep,  that isn't going to form  like a static electricity.  You mean to put something  and add some other material  around here? 
[00:54:30]  Something that is not foam.  Foam causes static electricity  and the lights is what heats it up.  Oh, no.  Randy, is there anything else  that you can put around  the telephone directly?  I've heard the question,  but the question is not valid  because it's making an assumption  which is not true.  The foam does not in any way  create static electricity  and Mr. Heydrich,  in demonstrating that the pages  were clinging together,  didn't demonstrate it  to my satisfaction.  I think they would perhaps  ask the judges  for their opinion on that.  I am not a scientist,  so I'm not qualified  to declare on it.  Judges?  Whatever static electricity 
[00:55:00]  exists in the styrofoam  would not really affect  the movement of the page  or the cleaning of the pages  together, in my opinion.  I would add that if this is  in fact psychic functioning,  I don't really see why  that would make a difference.  Oh, very well.  Randy, would you allow me  to turn perhaps half dozen pages  and then put them back?  Oh, yes.  You may be.  Oh, this is such a great fucking...  Oh, this guy's getting fucked.  And I'm getting  a really good update  on this guy  after this is over.  Oh, really?  Really good.  That's fine.  Gently, place them down gently 
[00:55:30]  so it doesn't disturb the foam.  All right.  I know.  Well, oh, I thought you...  Oh, the other way?  Yeah, the other way.  That's what I thought you meant.  Would that...  Sure.  That's another move.  Sure.  I'm not going to be able  to do it anyway.  Static is going to still be here  because of the foam.  Oh.  Well, it is the opinion  of the judges  that there is not enough  static foam by the...  Well, my opinion.  ...the foam  to be a problem.  So, uh...  Under the conditions  agreed upon,  it, uh...  It seemed that now  you should at least try 
[00:56:00]  with psychic power  to turn the page  to the top.  Bob wants to just see  all that shit  blow off the table.  Yeah, they knew  how to fuck people  in the late 80s.  Boy, did they ever.  All right, he's back  in his weird  kung fu fucking position.  Now he's laughing.  He's so fucked.  This is affecting  his livelihood.  Yeah.  That dumb hairdo.  Oh, his horrid hairdo  and his fucking...  His trickery.  Why would you  accept this challenge?  Why?  Why?  What's that?  What a great show.  This show is just  fuck this guy.  And you know...  Fuck our guest. 
[00:56:30]  This week on  Fuck This Guy.  Yeah, fuck this guy.  Oh, he's doing  the hand motion  but they're not even convincing?  No.  He's just kind of  hanging his hands  over the book?  What do you do  in this position?  Do you just say  fucking blow it?  You do what he did.  He came up with  a good excuse  to static electricity.  He's a pretty good thinker.  That's the whole time  he was doing  in the fucking mumbo-jumbo.  He's thinking  what can I say?  Yeah.  Did I say static electricity?  He's going to stick  with that static electricity.  Yeah, it's just...  And the light heats it.  Yeah, the light heats it.  He's moving his hands  in that like 
[00:57:00]  fucking magic way.  Oh.  Look.  Uh-oh.  He's back up.  He's standing up  and trying again.  Is this going to turn  for you?  No, it isn't.  Oh.  Have you reached  the point then  at which we can declare  the demonstration terminated?  This isn't a magician's trick.  I can't just come up,  bang, bang,  and it's over.  Oh.  I have to be  to where I can work  with something small  and then big  to build up my own self.  But you did it.  Oh, this must have.  This is a trick.  It has to be done. 
[00:57:30]  You know,  this is just power.  It's mental power.  The conditions agreed upon  have been fulfilled.  And, of course,  we can't change  the conditions now  in midstream.  So, in the opinion  of our judges here,  This guy's full of shit.  you have not seen  a demonstration  of psychic power,  have you?  Yes, that's correct.  You have not.  And, Randy,  Uh,  What about that check, Randy?  James has not won  the $10,000  with this demonstration. 
[00:58:00]  So it seems.  Now, you have heard  what James  his explanation is.  Do you have any comment  to make on that?  Bob, the comment  very briefly is  that I have gone  through many hundreds  of these tests  with many hundreds  of people who claim  to have psychic powers.  And, quite frankly,  it's more or less  the same story  every time.  When a simple,  direct,  very uncomplicated  protocol is used  and the control  is applied,  the psychic forces  don't seem to be present.  If, indeed,  they are ever present  at all.  I still look 
[00:58:30]  for some sort of evidence  of psychic powers  to date,  I have not found any.  Up to this very moment,  I am still  totally unconvinced.  Judges,  do you have  any further comment  to make?  Do you agree  that you have not  seen a psychic demonstration?  Yes, I would agree  that I have not seen  a psychic demonstration.  I would like to say  that as a parapsychologist,  I believe that there  are other evidence  under control conditions  that do demonstrate,  I would think,  to a reasonable person  that psychic phenomena 
[00:59:00]  do exist,  but obviously not  in this demonstration.  I want to thank you  very much.  He shakes his hand.  Thank you so much.  Why did he shake  Bob Barker's hand?  He just fucked up  your life.  It was a different time.  Before I say goodbye  to you, Randy,  I do indeed  appreciate the fact  that you joined us  on That's My Line,  Dr. Palmer.  That's my line.  Dr. Powell,  thank you so much.  Look at the back guy.  The brothers mustaches.  So,  we'll be back.  So that's  James Heidrich, 
[00:59:30]  I guess?  Yeah,  that's incredible.  So,  there's a bunch of people  that know about  James Heidrich.  He was never really  heard from again.  That totally fucked him  right there.  Ruined him.  And Kevin from Connecticut  and others  have written me  and in 1989,  this guy James Heidrich  received a 17-year sentence  for molesting five boys.  Wait,  that's him?  He's currently incarcerated  at a California prison.  89?  Why is he  99-06  shipping out in  06? 
[01:00:00]  That's him?  Yeah,  he was released  and then got charged  for sexual assault  and went back in.  What a piece of shit.  Wait,  he got charged again?  Yeah.  So,  he did his 17-year sentence,  whatever that ended up being,  and then he got out  and then he molested again?  Allegedly?  Yeah,  it says right here.  You can see it in his eyes.  It's the same guy.  Terrible guy.  Just older now.  In 89,  he got the 17-year sentence  and he did it  and he is currently  incarcerated  at California  Men's Colony, 
[01:00:30]  whatever,  prison  for sexual assault  is what Wikipedia says.  He got mad  because his victims  started putting styrofoam  around their assholes.  He couldn't do it.  What a fucking creep.  He's a ghoul.  What a creep.  What, what?  Is there more?  Well,  just from what we just watched,  after an hour and a half  of him staring at the pages,  the show was edited  for time.  Wow.  That went on for an hour  and a half.  Hour and a half.  Wow.  No kidding. 
[01:01:00]  Jesus Christ.  He was just evaluating  everything.  Yeah.  Is the amazing Randy  still alive?  Oh, yeah.  Because he looked  really old in that.  He looked old right there.  And that's got to be  almost 30 years ago,  that clip, right?  Look him up, Sam.  I believe he is alive.  He,  if you want to have  some fun,  look up  amazing Randy clips online.  He's great.  He is great.  He debunks everyone.  He also  made a,  made a life of it.  He confessed  his fraud  in 1981 
[01:01:30]  and admitted  that he developed  his unique talent  while he was in prison  that he did not learn it  from a Chinese master.  Oh.  Ah.  That's hydrant.  Fraud exposed.  He's in jail  before that, too.  Yeah.  Isn't there something  with Houdini, too?  He's dead.  No, but supposedly  Houdini gave  some kind of password  and, uh,  and, you know,  and then his wife  would talk to these people  and, uh,  all,  all she wanted was,  well,  what was the password 
[01:02:00]  that he,  he, you know,  he gave me  and not one person  was able to do it.  Bosco.  Oh, he was busting them.  Bosco.  Bosco.  Huh?  Yeah, look up  the Houdini thing  because that's another one  where, where,  you know,  Houdini promised  he would come back  and talk from, uh,  the afterlife  and he told his wife,  look, you know,  here's the password  in case someone,  in case someone,  you know,  is telling you  that they're,  they're getting, uh,  you know,  a message or whatever  from me from the afterlife  and not one psychic 
[01:02:30]  was able to, uh,  come up with the password.  Yes.  The password is Houdini.  That's right.  Houdini, yes.  Magic.  Damn.  That's all crap.  Yeah, I think so, too.  Um, we don't know  everything yet,  but this shit is crap.  Katie Couric  just drove me nuts  with, by not challenging her  and allowing her  to do her nonsense.  Mm.  What a load of shite.  Mm-hmm. 
[01:03:00]  That guy got so fucked.  How great was that  with his dumb mustache?  He was trying to look the part.  His pedo-stache.  Those shows back then,  like, like,  who would agree  to go on that?  They pretty,  I bet you that they worded it.  In such a way  where you thought  you could work,  you could do it.  Yeah.  It's 10,000 bucks,  1980.  That's like $100,000.  Because if you're the guy  that's blowing onto the,  onto little boys  and, uh,  phone books,  I don't know.  It certainly was.  Uh, you're thinking  in your mind,  all right,  how can they fool me? 
[01:03:30]  Mm-hmm.  And he probably went  through all the scenarios  and went,  no, I can work around  all that.  90 minutes.  90 minutes  of watching that asshole  in a karate,  that fucking  dumb hand moves.  Kid fucker.  Oh.  Kid fucker doing  his little hand moves.  It brings us back to,  it brings us back to today.  Isn't David Blaine's,  uh,  trick almost over?  It ended last night.  And didn't he have,  like,  an incident,  like we all said  would happen?  He had low blood sugar  or something?  Oh, no.  It kind of had a little,  he was swaying or something?  Did they have to lead him off  like they always do 
[01:04:00]  from his tricks?  He was snoozing.  He was snoozing?  I went down and saw him yesterday.  Was he losing?  He was sleeping.  Because I heard.  He was sleeping,  standing up?  Yeah,  I caught him.  He kept falling asleep  while he was up there.  Was he being electrified  at that point?  There were some bolts  here and there.  Some bolts  here and there.  Another asshole.  Yeah.  He didn't look like that.  Another asshole  that people just  fucking want to buy into.  David Blaine  was getting electrocuted,  was he?  Really?  Yeah,  sure he was.  Okay,  sure.  Yeah.  Sure he was. 
[01:04:30]  I think we got D.L.  Hughley coming in now.  Oh!  What happened?  He woke up sick.  He'll come back later.  Oh,  he's getting us back  for the time we made  believe we were sick.  Gotcha.  Fuck,  maybe we could do  a little Jacktober  next then.  Jacktober!  Hopefully we make up  for fucking yesterday.  Holy shit.  Sure.  I think E-Rock enjoyed it,  but no one else really.  I got a tree on my house.  I got a tree on my house.  That's really not  me so quick to talk.  I was working on that one.  Yeah. 
[01:05:00]  I got a tree on my house.  I got a tree on my house.  I got a tree on my house.  I got a tree on my house.  Sounds like people  enjoyed it yesterday.  What else did he throw in  at the end?  He got broke a TV.  He broke a TV.  The password,  the Houdini password  was simply  Houdini Shepardini.  Houdini Shepardini.  Oh,  that's even better.  That is a good one.  Houdini Shepardini.  Pepper 913. 
[01:05:30]  I can't take credit for that one.  God,  that's terrible.  That's a good one.  See,  look,  look at him.  He's all exhausted.  David Blaine,  man.  They're carrying him out.  73 hours,  no sleep.  Well,  a little bit of sleep,  but no food.  They have to carry him out  after everyone.  Look at his big bulge.  What's going on there?  He's packing.  Is that an electrified cock  he's got there?  Cock and balls?  Cock and balls.  Big.  Juicy.  Rosalie was the Houdini password. 
[01:06:00]  Was it?  I don't know.  Just going with somebody.  Rose butt.  I guess that was a song  that his,  him and his wife enjoyed.  Hmm.  Cockled is the password.  Imagine it's something.  Yes,  I'm getting it.  It says bull preparation.  Oh my God,  that's it.  His legs appeared swollen  by the end of the 72 hours.  Oh no,  I hope all as well.  I'll see.  That would happen  if you're standing for 72 hours.  The ear plugs 
[01:06:30]  that seemed to fit so well  at the start  were hurting him.  Aww.  That's terrible.  His ear plugs hurt.  Like Jimmy.  It's like he was standing  on a subway for a long time.  Yeah,  it's pretty much  listening to music.  Yeah.  Were they given a music  to listen to?  No,  but he had earbuds in.  It's like he stood in line  for a fucking iPhone 5.  Yeah.  An Apple 5,  excuse me.  We all know  it's an Apple 5.  Apple 5?  Do you think it bothers him  that the article  on MSNBC  refers to him  as Daredevil David Blaine  and not Magician?  Well,  he shouldn't be  considered either 
[01:07:00]  one of those things  at this point.  that's right.  When I spoke to him,  he seemed okay  with calling it a stunt.  He told me.  Sam Roberts.  Sam Roberts.  We're going to break  and do some Jocktober  and we got Bob Kelly  and Joe DeRosa coming in.  They got their book  being released today,  right?  I believe Cheat  comes out today,  yes.  Nice.  That's exciting  for those guys.  I was looking up  stations to do  for Jocktober  throughout the coming weeks  and I found one  that somebody  had recommended  but it said, 
[01:07:30]  today on the show,  Bobby Kelly  talks about...  Oh, really?  Who cares?  Well,  I got to find out  from him  if it's worth doing.  Oh.  All right.  We'll do some  Jocktober next.  Sirius XM.  This is the  O.P. and Anthony Show.  It's Jocktober.  A celebration  of all things  shitty in radio.  That's not very nice.  Fantastic failures  of pontificating proportions.  That's so bad.  Wow. 
[01:08:00]  An interactive exploration  of what makes  radio rancid.  Jocktober.  O.M.G.  Hosts,  Holes,  Bits,  and Stunt Boys.  This isn't funny.  It's time for  Jocktober.  Jocktober.  We're a little nervous, man.  This is a benchmark bit  for the O.P. and Anthony Show  and we did Scott and Todd  yesterday  and Scott and Todd  always puts the brakes  on Jocktober.  Fucked up the energy  of the whole Jocktober thing.  I also noticed  in the intro  we referenced 
[01:08:30]  Stunt Boys.  Yeah,  no Stunt Boys yet.  No Stunt Boys yet.  Not really Stunt Boys  but the Stunt Boys  are now the sort of like  the crazy  chubby young guy.  Right, yeah, yeah.  It's hard to find  a stunt boy  in radio anymore.  They just don't do that shit anymore.  They're not allowed  to do any of that stuff anymore.  So you get the  rough and tumble sports guy  who is out drinking all night.  Yeah!  Watching the big day!  Yeah, watching the game!  Yeah, we've had a couple  of, you know,  crazy watch out  this guy's nuts.  Down in the man cave. 
[01:09:00]  You can have a cool room  in your house.  You know,  but to call it  the man cave.  The man cave.  Honey,  go down to the man cave.  Couple of guys  coming over.  Exactly.  Today's Jocktober.  Show number six  is being featured.  Are we going to do  something a little  different today?  Yeah.  Usually you got  the two guys  in the hole.  Two guys in the hole,  usually. 
[01:09:30]  Usually.  The tough guy.  Oh boy.  That's the number one.  Oh God!  That's the number one,  right?  Yeah.  Morning radio show.  You get the two guys,  you get the radio veteran,  a young buck  that might be a little edgy,  staying out a little  late at night  and does the sports  and then you got  the dumb hole  that fucking puts  the brakes on everything.  Yeah.  Today we're doing  Two Girls and a Guy.  Two Girls and a Guy.  And it's called  Two Girls and a Guy?  It's called  the Two Girls and a Guy.  So they're kind of  going off the whole 
[01:10:00]  Two Girls, One Cup thing?  Whoa, whoa, whoa.  So why wouldn't they  go Two Girls, One Guy?  Not Two Girls and a Guy.  No, I don't think they're at all.  Two Girls and a Guy  in the morning.  I don't think they're doing it  based on the...  Yeah, probably not.  They look a little...  Wait, what's happening  is there's a black woman,  hefty.  She looks like Bookman  from Good Times.  She's wearing  a fucking light blue  baseball hat  and she's looking at this...  She's kind of looking  to the side like,  what?  And the white guy  in the pink shirt  has his arm around her  and the white girl  on his left  is standing in front 
[01:10:30]  with the,  oh, guys,  look on her face  and she's looking away  like, oh, boy,  here we go.  Oh, here we go again.  Here we go.  The black broad  on this morning show  also looks like  the black guy  from SNL  that's been there forever  and hasn't done  one thing funny.  Wow.  I don't know his name,  but he's been there forever.  He?  Yeah, he's horrible.  He's fat.  He's chubbier.  Was he in that sketch  we watched yesterday?  I guess.  Yeah.  Yeah.  He has not done  anything memorable  on SNL,  but he's been there  for about 10 years  as the token black guy. 
[01:11:00]  Has he really?  I've never...  At least.  He's been there forever.  She looks like that guy.  Two girls and a guy  morning show.  We're talking about  Tanya.  Yep.  Kelly and Mike.  Mike the guy.  Oh, that's how  they reference him?  The guy.  Tanya, Kelly,  and Mike the guy.  Mike the guy  on 95SX.  Yeah, that's the name  of the station.  I can't get over her face  that she's making  in that fucking...  Oh, guys!  Oh, boy.  Here we go again. 
[01:11:30]  Oh, he's got his arm  around a black woman.  She's all disgusted.  Wouldn't that be funny  if that's where  the dynamic was?  Yeah.  All this interracial stuff  and her just objecting  to it on the grounds  that Christ wants us  with her own...  Oh, guys!  Yeah, she just wants  to have an easy day at work,  but these two...  Oh, boy.  These two are not  allowing that to happen.  They get a little rambunctious.  95SX in Charleston,  South Carolina.  Yeah.  Going to Charleston today.  Oh, boy. 
[01:12:00]  All right, here we go.  The crew banters  about the song...  Okay.  I was thinking Charlotte,  but it's Charleston.  Oh, Charleston.  Yeah.  The crew banter  is about the song  they're coming out of.  Yeah, you know,  like, they play the song.  It's by a band  called Fun,  big single,  and they just got  all kinds of material  to riff off of  just based on the end  of the song.  Nice.  Let's do this.  639 on 95SX.  It is the two girls 
[01:12:30]  and a guy show.  That's fun  and some nights.  I just feel like  I should hold Simba  up in the air  from Lion King  on this song.  This is the best song  ever.  I love it.  It does sound like  a Majestic Jungle song,  doesn't it?  It really does.  Browning the new king.  Yeah, it pumps you up.  It's like I should be  running with the gazelles  right now.  I love it.  In the African jungle.  What is she talking about?  Is that the white girl?  It is a good song.  He sounds a little  light in the loafers  as they say  when they talk about 
[01:13:00]  gay people.  No, he just likes  to have a good time.  He has the gay voice.  You know what?  The gay voice.  Make fun of what you want.  The gay voice.  That kid was on  to a few things.  Oh, he certainly was.  Oh, no.  What?  Come on now.  What's going on, Sam?  That's ridiculous.  What happened?  Oh, no.  Well, I just went to  the two girls  and a guy Facebook page.  Now, can I stop you  right there for a second?  Yeah.  We didn't once mention  going to their Facebook page.  We didn't.  So I'm very confused by this.  No, I went to their  Facebook page.  Must be their listeners, right? 
[01:13:30]  Exactly.  I went to their Facebook page  to find more pictures  of them or whatever.  Oh, man.  That's wrong.  And their listeners,  this listener actually  has a wow sticker  as their Facebook picture,  but their listeners  have a picture  of a white girl  with a black erect penis  in her mouth.  Oh, my God.  Oh, that's terrible.  Oh, no.  Oh, just duty diapers.  That ass.  I wonder who that was.  Congratulations.  You're a douchebag.  There's actually a picture  of two girls, one cup. 
[01:14:00]  Again, I say,  I don't know  if their listeners,  but I don't think  that the name is based  on two girls, one cup.  Yeah, these listeners  are a little out of control  at this station.  Disgusting.  There's boobs.  There's some tits.  Yeah.  Two guys.  Two guys.  Starving for good radio.  It's a picture of a guy's dick  and a girl's ass,  but he's pulling it out  and there's like  a light-colored shit on it.  So someone has painted 
[01:14:30]  like eyes and a mustache  on the picture  around the dick  so it looks like  he's smoking his cigar.  That's art.  I are the niggas.  Yeah, there's a picture  of a black guy.  Then you got more  stills from the  two girls, one cup video.  Brace yourselves.  Jack-tober is coming.  Oh, boy.  It's the Game of Thrones guy.  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, boy.  This isn't good.  What's that?  There's a picture  of Opie, Anthony,  Club Soda Kenny,  and Hitler  all posing together.  Yeah, Hitler's there. 
[01:15:00]  Hitler's got a wow shirt, though.  Yeah.  I didn't know you had him  on the BCN show.  Mm-hmm.  Mm-hmm.  Oh, hey, look at that.  This show is  Jack-tober approved.  Sam Roberts  holding up a little sign.  Nice.  That's a nice one.  Well, they got weird listeners.  A lot of crass people.  Yeah, they had fun  with that song.  That's kind of fun, right?  Oh, sure.  Fun radio.  Fun for everybody.  It's not going to hurt anyone.  Not at all.  Mike talks about pet shaming.  Yeah, pet shaming.  Tanya has a problem with it.  Oh, of course she does.  Well, you got to watch out  for Tanya, too.  Who's Tanya? 
[01:15:30]  Which one is she?  She's the woman on the left.  Oh, my God.  With the hat.  Yeah, the girl with the hat.  You can't say black girl.  No.  It's the one  that's a little happier.  Yeah.  Yeah.  But, yeah,  you got to watch out.  She's got a little bit  of sass about her.  Oh.  A little bit of attitude.  Never saw that coming.  Yeah.  What is pet shaming?  Are we going to find out?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  You'll find out in the clip.  Have you ever heard of this?  There's like this thing  going on online now  called pet shaming.  So if your pet,  like if Tatum ate 
[01:16:00]  a pair of expensive shoes,  you would take a picture  of Tatum next beside  of these expensive shoes?  Okay.  Just three girls.  Just three girls  having a little talk  in the morning.  That's it.  Wow.  Fezzes from around the world.  Still want that.  I still want that bit.  One person,  they post happy Friday  on their Facebook,  obviously from last Friday.  Oh, yeah.  Nice.  And one of their listeners  has responded by saying,  here comes the pre. 
[01:16:30]  Here comes the pre.  Pet shaming.  Sure of Tatum  next beside of these  expensive shoes.  Okay.  With a sign around his neck  or whatever.  I ate mommy's expensive shoes  and I really don't care.  or something like that  posted to this website.  It's become a thing.  Okay.  Well, a dad took it  one step further  and he shamed his  three-year-old daughter  for pooping in the shower.  What?  Oh, I love the sounders. 
[01:17:00]  You do?  Actually, no.  I don't.  I just said I did.  I think it adds  a layer to the show  that quite frankly  we're missing sometimes.  You know what's  going to happen today, right?  What's going to happen?  You guys are going  to have a meeting today  and you know  even though  the guys do fine  you notice how  sound effects  can really help a bit?  Like Tracy.  She wants you  to fucking throw  she always wanted  us throwing things in.  Yeah.  Sounds and even fucking  Well, these guys here  want more sounds too.  Oh, do they?  I'm not saying  it was a good show  but there's no reason  we can't pull out  some good in the bad. 
[01:17:30]  I think we can learn  from that show  you featured on Jogtober.  Sound of the elevated  door shutting  and me hitting  the fucking lobby button.  Their use of sound effects  were terrific.  Yeah, you know  you could joke and all.  Yeah, their content  was a little weak  but you've got to acknowledge  that they really know  how to pump things up  with sound effects.  Yes, it is this  beautiful little girl  three years old  just a smile  she doesn't know  what the sign  around her neck said  but it basically said  you know  I pooped in the shower  and you know  blah blah blah  and daddy had to 
[01:18:00]  clean it up  and he put it online  it was on Tumblr  and I mean  it just  the prank  obviously he was  trying to be funny  but the prank  just completely  backfired  and all these parents  are saying  he should have  his kids taken away  that it's child abuse  that it's online bullying  and it's one of his own relatives  and she's going to have  major psychological scars  when she grows up  you know  the thing about this  when I saw that yesterday  I was livid  I said  he's not talking about  his child  he can't possibly be  but  my problem 
[01:18:30]  oh boy  what the fuck  what  I think the kid's  going to be alright  you think so  you think after all this  the kid is going to  I don't think the father  gives a fuck  no  that there's outrage  over his dumb little prank  he was doing  he's not talking about  his child  he can't possibly be  but  my problem is  people don't know  how to distinguish things  you know how you have  family gatherings  like Christmas Thanksgiving  yeah  you tell funny stories  about your kids  and you embarrass them 
[01:19:00]  a little bit  you don't embarrass them  for the whole world  to see  I don't think DSS  needs to be called in  but I think he needs  to check himself  or somebody needs  to put something  embarrassing up  about him  on this weapon  that's what a lot  of people are saying  to stop doing this  he should be like a sign  I humiliated my daughter  to the world  and I don't  you know  I'll never forgive myself  for it  or something  oh god  you're the guy  be a guy  I don't think he's  the dynamic is  the guy  should stick up 
[01:19:30]  for the father  like it's no big  fucking deal  he did this  he's Mike the guy  after all  yeah he's called  Mike the guy  how about you  be a guy  yeah  no guy would  agree with these  stupid bitches  you know  cackling about this  no  no  no  no  good guy  to the world  and I don't  you know  I'll never  forgive myself  for it  or something  along those lines  it's coming for him  when she gets older  and she's taking care  of him  and he's in the pens  yeah  when he's pooping  in his bed 
[01:20:00]  exactly  take a picture  and put it online  put that online  they're irritating  and they're kind of  sissy-ish  sissy-ish  but I wouldn't  it's like  it's just like  look  it's not  Scott and Todd  awful like  Jacktober  like it's  they're just like  yeah what a  shitty show  this is just  it's just there  yeah  it's like  it doesn't make me angry  it just makes me  like  well we're early  oh god  Sam are you defending  your choice for Jacktober  oh yeah 
[01:20:30]  I would definitely say  there's more clips to play  before we all come to  judgment on this show  really  I'm not worried about it  I'm just bothered  that the guy's not being  a guy  he's not  no  no  he's saying  god that's disgusting  one listener  and then the n-word  oh my god  and then tits  she is a giant black woman  why would they allow that  on their facebook page  yeah what type of crazy person  would  listener would post that  that's insanity 
[01:21:00]  it's ridiculous  what's this  oh god  I just can't imagine  Jimmy would ya  that person's racist  whoever posted it  has to be  terrible  that's a very  that's a very big  fat lady  with a very  vicious  what would you call  heading around the  what do you call it  with the words  around the fucking picture  caption  I guess caption  sure  one person is pointing out  on the facebook page  and justifiably  so questioning  thought this was  a family show  oh man 
[01:21:30]  you know  you got the jacktober  the two girls and a guy  morning show  out of charleston south carolina  someone regrows an ear  a story wacky enough  for two girls and a guy to cover  six fifty five ninety five sx tanya kelly and mike two girls and a guy in the morning  doctors at john hopkins uh medical center have helped 42 year old sherry walters grow a new ear 
[01:22:00]  oh  on her arms  what  enough of that thing  i think they use that a lot  they probably do  that's fucking hilarious  you like that  these guys are good  yeah  the use of sound effects  what is that picture  it's clint eastwood  at the republican convention  you know when he was talking to the chair for the people out there  but instead there is a fat  retarded looking e-rock  a horrible e-rock picture 
[01:22:30]  you're also missing that clint eastwood is handing him a salad  and baby e-rock  because he's in a diaper  he's in an old school diaper  he's making a face that he doesn't want to eat it  yeah he's disgusted that clint eastwood  would offer baby e-rock a salad  baby e-rock  it's got a rattle  and his big gut is hanging out  that's a terrible photo of e-rock  that's hilarious  i didn't know clint eastwood was talking to baby e-rock  e-rock why did you take that photo that's terrible 
[01:23:00]  why wouldn't you just take the salad from him  and why wouldn't you bring pants  fat baby e-rock is gonna be my new favorite  fat baby e-rock  the face is great  it's like baby e-wee  it's like uh  i wonder why they got that picture  why he was going like  why were you doing that face e-rock  do you remember the actual picture  no i don't  yeah  i remember that picture  i think he was trying to  you know make  he was making a funny face  for one  like a fan said  hey can i get a picture  oh  and he decided to you know  yeah he doesn't like the fans  we all know that  i don't know why 
[01:23:30]  despises him  uh let's get back to the uh ear growing on an arm story  oh  on her arm  what  why  well i'm glad you asked tanya  walters is the first person to ever have their ear regrown this way  she used uh doctors used cartilage from her rib  to shape the new ear  which needed to be placed under the skin in her arm  for four months  so it would grow  you're not laughing at their stupid banter 
[01:24:00]  trust me  oh  as we play the audio  sam scrolls through the latest pictures  making  making it to their facebook page  oh my god  they've just taken  a great turn for the worst  e-rock  oh e-rock  wow e-rock  what happened to you  a much thinner photo of e-rock  with miss joe nicolini  wow  what the fuck  oh god  roland and choice  oh boy  sitting on roland's shoulder  there's a girl  that's a good picture  girl with a bunch of duty  why is he using my high school picture 
[01:24:30]  next  oh uncle john paul  it's a picture of the pope kissing  a little girl on the lips  holding her cheeks too as he does it  yeah  so we got the banter  we got the banter on the ear thing  i guess the problem is  uh the fake outrage  a lot of duty pictures  yeah  and oh  you don't like those sam  i hate them  that is so fucking disgusting  ball and cock torture  yes  yes  yes 
[01:25:00]  reverend al  the theme is  a guy with a bad mustache  sucking duty out of a hiney  oh god  the theme is absolutely  duty  um  yeah the fake outrage  that's the problem here  if we're gonna help this dumb show  jesus christ  wow  who would do that  that's terrible  hey that was a cool day  the AF fucking  oh god  look at that picture below  me and ad dressed up as goalies  as people  hit golf balls at us  see  that was outrageous 
[01:25:30]  that was outrageous  we were crazy  these are hilarious  this is a nude photo  of jim norton  yeah with a hat by my penis  i don't remember taking that picture  what would you do  oh there's a retarded guy  and the caption is  like he's holding a microphone  asking someone a question  and he says  as president  what would you do  to bring the economy  out of its current potato  implying that the retarded man  asked a dumb question  here which needed to be placed 
[01:26:00]  under the skin  in her arm  for four months  so it would grow  the new ear  was created  to replace  the one she lost  due to  kind of like  a form of cancer  oh my gosh  following the growth phase  doctors transplanted  the newly grown ear  right into her skull  oh okay  crazy  is that not  okay  okay  now we've got  too far  okay  okay  crazy  oh fuck  so stupid 
[01:26:30]  where are they supposed  to put the ear  you idiots  yeah  can't handle  a little medical story  oh god  right into her skull  oh okay  crazy  is that not  like the coolest  medical breakthrough  ever  that is sci-fi  at its best  by the way  there's a fucking  photoshop  yeah  of that horrible  chainsaw beheading  the mexican cartels  did  and the one guy  is sitting there  waiting to be killed  and the guy  who's being beheaded

[01:36:30]  this one's definitely real  I think so  even though we tell the people  you're not allowed to do  fake phone calls anymore  don't tell the cops  because I think they're doing them  if you hear fake phone calls  on the radio  that means it's fake  yeah  oh right exactly  it's fake  fake  if it's fake  yeah  fake fake fake fake fake  fake  two girls and a guy  phone scam  oh god  I hate the button sound  hello  hi  yeah  who's this please  hi  I'm  I'm  I was in the restaurant

[01:38:00]  so they gave me your  cell phone number  because it's kind of  important  yeah  first of all  thank you man  it's been  kind of been working  on that shift  for kind of three years  straight man  no one has ever  taken care of me  thank you  that's what I'm calling about  the midday guy  yeah it's gotta be like  the midday guy  or something right  midday guy  he's gonna get his playlist  together  because he's gonna  feed your need for rock  but in between  he does some side work  for the morning show  he's been taking  improv classes  yeah yeah yeah  if you guys ever need  I do characters  that's terrible 
[01:38:30]  now Jimmy's in  that's very bad  take care of me  like that man  thank you  yeah that's what  I'm calling about  it's kind of embarrassing  but I need to apologize  I didn't mean to leave  you a hundred dollar tip  I meant to leave you  ten dollars  are you serious  yeah on my credit card  I put an extra zero  when I saw it  and I called  my charge  and it went through  I looked online  and then I realized it  and I left a hundred dollar tip  not a ten dollar tip  yeah but I thought  I thought the service  I gave you  I went above and beyond  in fact don't you remember  I threw in a few extra 
[01:39:00]  yeah yeah yeah  I mean your service  was great  it had nothing to do  with that  I'm just not  that kind of guy  who needs a hundred dollar tips  you actually specifically said  hey man here's a little  something extra for you  I did yes  that is a lot extra to me  ten dollars  well yeah  I thought it was good  I sincerely apologize  I'm so sorry  you know what  the fact of the matter is  is that I need to get  ninety dollars from you  once you sign off  on a gratuity  that's it man  not to mention the fact  that I've already accounted  for that money  that money's spent  it's a hundred dollars  it was like a forty dollar check 
[01:39:30]  I gave you a hundred dollar tip  you gotta be  is there anything  you can do to me  to give it back  I said wow  this is really nice of you  and you said yeah  a little something extra  well I thought ten dollars  was pretty nice actually  can I ask you a question  why if he added incorrectly  wouldn't the total  have just reflected  what he meant to add  for instance  it was a forty dollar check  he wanted to give ten dollars  fifty dollars  right  how would he mistakenly  write a hundred and forty dollars  for the total  exactly  he wouldn't have 
[01:40:00]  he would have written  what he thought  was the bill  plus ten bucks  and more importantly  why on their Facebook page  is there a woman  sucking a horse's penis  oh my god  that's disgusting  you should say  why anywhere in the world  is a woman  sucking a horse's penis  oh my god  what is that guy doing  he's covered in shit  just covered in shit  oh man  we did  what  what the hell  I don't remember that  oh I do  intoxicated  yeah it's me  you and someone else  from your 
[01:40:30]  hot tub  yeah that's  yeah  what's her name  no idea  I said hey  I said wow  this is really nice of you  and you said yeah  a little something extra  I thought ten dollars  was pretty nice  garbage man  no way to get the money  back then  get the money back  first of all  the money's spent man  you should know  what you put on  somebody's gratuity man  so uh  can you give me fifty dollars  you want me to give you fifty dollars  I'll come down tomorrow  you just give me a fifty spot  and it'll still be really good tip  I'm in a tight spot here  you come back to the restaurant 
[01:41:00]  a few times  and you can give me  regular fifteen percent  and then when we reach  the hundred dollars  the difference  then we can call it  two girls and a guy  it's a way  95SX  so all that shit  needs a punchline  and then you gotta  two girls and a guy  two girls and a guy  station ID  that was some  really  lasers  hit the lasers  that was terrible  terrible phone call  really bad  oh they insist on doing them  yeah  the fake fucking phone scams  they insist  spice it up

[01:46:00]  A what box?  Butt plugs.  A butt box?  Butt plugs.  I'm not following what you're saying.  Butt plugs.  I have a bad connection.  I don't understand.  What is it?  Butt plugs.  Butt box?  Is it like a receptacle you're talking about?  Butt plugs, yeah.  What kind of plug is it?  A spark plug you're talking about?  Butt plugs.  Oh, hold on.  Hello.  What are you looking for?  Butt plug.  Spark plug.  What kind?  Butt plug.  What kind of a spark plug? 
[01:46:30]  No, butt plug.  I just don't understand you, sir.  I'm sorry.  Butt plug?  A spark plug.  Butt plug.  Butt plug?  Butt plug.  Never heard of it.  What do you use it for?  Butt plug.  Huh?  Butt plug.  What do you use it for, sir?  Butt plug.  Butt plug.  Butt plug.  Butt plug.  Yeah.  Butt lug?  Butt plug.  I know, butt.  But what do you use it on?  What do you use it in?  I'm trying to figure...  Butt plug.  Butt plug. 
[01:47:00]  Yeah, okay.  I got you a spark plug.  There's all kinds of spark plugs.  Butt plug.  Butt plug.  Butt plug.  Butt plug.  Butt plug.  Butt?  Butt plug.  Oh, sorry, sir.  We don't understand what you want.  Butt plug.  Butt plug.  I don't know.  We don't carry that.  Butt plug?  Yeah, we don't carry it.  Thank you.  All right.  This is the Opie and Anthony show on Sirius XM. 
[01:47:30]  All right.  Ready?  I'm hanging on the show with my friend Ant and Greg.  We all of a sudden start to eat eggs.  We put them down and talk into the mic.  Because you know we don't like to fuck the dyke.  We like pussy.  And it's got to be juicy.  Don't laugh at me, Anthony, while I'm on the mic.  You might not know how to fuck a dyke.  I'll say it twice.  You don't give a shit.  Opie has a smile that makes you go, wow. 
[01:48:00]  Anthony has hair that makes you go, he.  Opie has a smile that makes you go, wow.  Anthony has a cock that makes me go, dude.  Fuck you.  You know, and that dog you had is a fucking mutt.  Opie had the right moves because his steak was on the floor and his potatoes weren't there  no more.  So he killed that motherfucker, rough, rough, rough.  But you know what?  It wasn't that guff.  Look it up in the dictionary if you don't know what I mean because I don't have time to show  you the team of the A, the Rampage Jackson.  You know I'm a faction of what I should have been a long time ago. 
[01:48:30]  But I'll keep rapping.  You don't hate this.  You don't even know.  I'll throw it in right in the middle.  I'm so fucking, wow, I eat Skittles.  Ah, yeah.  Opie has a smile that makes you go, wow.  Anthony has hair that makes you go, he.  Opie has a smile that makes you go, wow.  Anthony has a cock that makes me go, dude.  I'm not done.  Fuck that.  I'll make it jack.  And then I'll look back on the guy with the heart attack that saw Sasquatch in the woods. 
[01:49:00]  All of a sudden, he has the word coulds in his fucking mouth because he had a gun made  of a stick.  All of a sudden, you had to fit.  Did you know him?  Did you know her?  Or did you like it?  White girls like me.  Black girls like me.  Girls adore me.  Even the ones that even saw me know I rhyme with a fucking show.  Why?  I don't know.  I'll steal a fucking rap from a hoe.  I don't give a shit.  I'll move on.  Push another button.  I'll flow with it.  You don't even got no fucking show without it.  Yo, I'm Bob Kelly.  I'm a rapping genius. 
[01:49:30]  Opie has a smile that makes you go, wow.  Anthony has hair that makes you go, he.  Opie has a smile that makes you go, wow.  Anthony has a cock that makes me go, dude.  Sirius XM.  Sirius XM.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  Of course.  We got Bob Kelly and Joe DeRosa coming in the studio.  I gotta say, that was terrible.  Well, yeah.  Bob's rapping was not good.  It was supposed to be terrible.  We just played your rap, Bob Kelly.  You're not a very good rapper.  I'm a great rapper and I'm a great rock and roll singer. 
[01:50:00]  It was a terrible rap.  You are a good rock and roll singer, I must confess.  I just ripped up a photo.  One of your interns ran down the hall to get Joe DeRosa's signature for his cousin.  Oh, man.  And I fucking shredded it.  Yeah, miserable fucking ripped up the autograph.  Yeah, Bobby, why would you do that?  You had your birthday yesterday.  You should be in a good mood.  Happy birthday.  Hey, thank you, Jimmy.  That penis cock was very disturbing.  I've seen some penis cocks in my day. 
[01:50:30]  Penis cock?  Yeah, they sent me...  Penis cake.  Sorry.  Jesus.  Sorry, Ian.  Your penis cake was disturbing.  I've seen some penis cakes in my day.  You had some streusel icing.  Where'd you get that?  Who gave that?  I didn't see it.  It was drizzled on the head.  It was drizzled on the head.  I'll show you.  It was drizzled on the head.  It's very cumming.  That made me sick.  It was a little rough there.  Yeah, and it took the fun out of it.  Who got you that?  It went from a fun cake to, oh, God, man. 
[01:51:00]  Who's going to eat that piece?  It really did.  I want a piece.  Oh, I'm trying to...  I was going to bring it in, but I didn't want to carry it.  It was on your Twitter.  That's funny.  You can go to your Twitter right now, right?  Look at the jizz on the tip.  That's great.  It's on the tip.  It makes it look like it's already cum on someone's face, and it's just lobbed up on the  back of it.  That's a little disturbing.  Would you smell that?  No, I didn't smell it.  Would you?  You know how hard it was not to eat it?  You didn't eat it?  No, I didn't eat it.  What'd you do with the cake?  It's at the house.  You want me to have somebody go get it?  Why?  Who's going to get it?  You guys can eat it.  Why don't we eat the cake? 
[01:51:30]  It was your birthday.  What's going on?  I don't want to eat no peck of cake.  What the hell's going on with you?  Day old dick.  Fuck you, Chip.  Chip, that's all you eat.  That's all you eat, Chip, is peck of cake.  Fucking day old dick cake.  Yeah, day old dick cake.  It's a happy birthday to me, right?  Yeah.  Ah, ha, ha, Chip.  Well, the picture's on your Twitter.  You should promote your Twitter.  Hey, Twitter.  There it is.  How was your birthday?  My birthday, I was, dude, I was up at six promoting this book all day.  All day.  All day long.  All day long.  All day long. 
[01:52:00]  All day long.  That's good.  Who do you guys talk to so far?  We did a radio tour yesterday.  It was a radio tour with people I know.  Well, that's good.  So, you know, it wasn't like just random people.  What was it like every 10 minutes a news station?  Every 10 minutes a news station.  Then we did Red Eye last night, me and Joseph.  Suicide Girls.  Oh, yes.  Cowhead.  Yeah.  Bunch of people.  Nice.  Yeah, doing Cowhead today.  I love Cowhead.  Cowhead's all right.  Yeah, he's very good.  He's about into Tampa.  I love Cowhead.  I saw that your wife was talking about getting you a present, and it was an earwax removal. 
[01:52:30]  Yeah.  Here's the thing.  Around 10 years ago, there was one hair in my ear.  Yeah.  And she went, let me get that.  Because that's what my wife does.  She waxes women.  Sure.  She preens you.  She preens, well, she doesn't really touch me at all.  Yeah.  Like once a year, she'll give me like, you know.  A once over?  Yeah, once over, once a year.  So, one hair that has turned into just fucking.  Moss.  It turned into an armpit.  I have an armpit for an ear.  Let's see. 
[01:53:00]  It's gone now.  It looks great now.  Oh, okay.  Yeah, she did it yesterday.  The upkeep, as you get a little older, yeah, there's a lot of upkeep that goes on.  A lot of hair removal, you know, mostly hair removal.  I don't, yeah.  You have a little, you have like, you have a little hair, and you don't, I clip it.  Don't clip it.  Why?  Because it makes two grow back.  You're right.  You're right.  And then the two go to four.  And it's, yeah, you just keep clipping it.  You gotta clip it.  Really?  Yeah.  Clip your nose hairs.  Clip your ears. 
[01:53:30]  You just gotta clip.  Clip your balls hair.  When you start clipping nose hair.  You just gotta clip.  When?  Yeah, because you go, you know, a long time without even thinking that you have to clip  your nose hairs.  Why do they start growing all of a sudden?  You get an itch, and then you're like, oh, they got in there a booger or something, and  then you realize, oh no, it's a hair.  It's a piece of rope.  And then you gotta, and then you gotta clip that shit out.  And why is it when you pluck a nose hair, it hurts your brain?  It really does make you rinse.  It's a direct connection to your brain.  Would you be freaked out if you pulled the nose hair, and all of a sudden  you saw a pube go, and disappear?  And a big long hair came out to you. 
[01:54:00]  Ten foot hair.  Yes.  Smells like pubic sweat.  I have gray nose hairs.  They're the worst.  Yeah, they're see-through.  Whoa.  Yeah, it's like X-Men fucking nose hairs.  And a little more coarse, right?  Yeah.  Those gray hairs become a bit coarse.  Yeah, like a wolf hair.  What else do you guys talk to?  We gotta get the word out for this.  We're going.  Let's do this.  CNN today and tomorrow.  Oh, wow.  Oh, gosh. 
[01:54:30]  All right.  Really?  Yeah, CNN tomorrow.  We have, what's the other, what's the one we're doing today?  What's the show called?  Showbiz tonight is today, and then the morning show on CNN's tomorrow.  And then we're doing, doing Sonny Fox's show today.  Sonny Fox.  Yeah.  The big show we're doing today, though, is the Opie and Anthony show.  That's right.  The biggest one on our cross-top.  That's the big sell for the book.  Today is heat.  That's where you're going to sell the most books.  We're officially authors.  It's available right now in stores, airports.  Online.  Online.  You guys getting any of this? 
[01:55:00]  A little cash for this?  The other copy that Bob was the whole second.  You guys going to make some pocket money off this?  I don't know.  I don't think there's a lot of money in books.  I don't know.  Jimmy, you have two books.  Did you make a lot of money off your first book?  I made the same off both, off each one.  Did you make your money on the residuals, or did you make money off the actual sales of  the book?  Just on the advance.  Just on the advance.  Oh, boy.  Yeah, you don't make money.  I didn't know that.  I thought you got the advance, and then you made more money.  Yeah, then you make more money.  Why is it entertainers just don't make money when they put out their products? 
[01:55:30]  Like, people don't make money when they put out a book.  Colin Quinn writes that brilliant fucking show for Broadway, and he literally made no money.  He pretty much broke even.  How is that fair?  I was just...  Joe?  Is that okay?  No, you go.  No, I was just talking to Roland in the hallway.  Fucked up.  About...  I go, this is a decent living you make, right, doing this?  And he was, like, telling me, like, the salary that you make in the position he had in television,  behind the scenes, or whatever. 
[01:56:00]  And it was, like, such...  I was, like, no...  The talent makes the least amount of money.  Yeah.  Unless you get to where, like, you guys are at, or, like...  Of course.  Yes, of course.  Chris Rock, or whatever.  You know what I mean?  Like...  The exception to the rule.  We all know that.  Yeah.  But, I mean, it's just like, you know...  You're always struggling, unless you get lucky.  Yeah, because if you put out a book and it does all right, that should be a nice paycheck.  Yeah, they have weird...  Unbelievable.  I know that we've...  I've grappled with production companies over distribution fees, which is how they... 
[01:56:30]  You did jiu-jitsu with fucking production companies?  Yeah, it was really odd, because we were discussing the contract while I was giving him a guillotine.  Wait, please make that face again.  They're guillotine, but they'd fuck you up on these hidden charges.  Yeah, we put out one product in 18 years of radio.  What was that?  It was a CD that did really well.  It sold hundreds of thousands of copies, and I'm not even...  I'm not, you know, inflating the number. 
[01:57:00]  And we shared...  When the guy was paying us, by the way, we shared a quarter per sale.  Twelve and a half cents each.  Was that...  But he didn't give us twelve and a half cents each on the...  No.  The gross.  Every once in a while, he would pay us twelve and a half cents per day.  We made less than $10,000.  Was that back when CDs first came out, and you could sell a CD for $30?  Yeah, it was...  Yeah.  Yeah, back in the good old days.  Yeah, remember that?  $30 album you'd buy?  Let's say we sold $200,000. 
[01:57:30]  That's about right.  Maybe even a little more.  That should be $200,000 each.  Yeah.  Dollar each per disc.  That's not outrageous.  Not at all.  Twelve and a half cents.  So we've never done another product is my point here.  I think we're going down a negative route here on this book.  Let's not talk about what we're not going to make.  Let's talk about what the fans are going to get.  Well, people should sell...  People should buy the book.  Yes.  Certainly.  I read a bunch of it.  It's really good.  Well, thank you.  Actually, you know what?  I think this is a positive conversation, because it means we're not...  We didn't do this for the money. 
[01:58:00]  We did it because we thought it'd be funny.  No, I did it.  I did it.  I thought I was going to make money.  I didn't know any of this after the shit thing.  If you told me that this is all we're getting, even if it's a hit, I would have said, go fuck  yourself.  Yeah, I know.  I would have said the same thing, but it's called spinning and PR-ing.  Well, maybe it'll lead to something else, guys.  Yeah, yeah.  Maybe it'll lead to something else.  You never know.  Write another book for free.  That's what it'll fucking lead to.  Cuck suckers.  Yeah, so buy this book.  I bet you your interviews were a little different yesterday than this. 
[01:58:30]  Yeah.  Than the reality check we're giving you.  We got a little heated on Red Eye.  It's just frustrating.  Yeah.  That's all.  With who?  This girl.  Fox News correspondent named Sandra Smith.  I don't think I know her.  She was very nice, but she sat in when we, she was on the panel, and she sat in when  we did the book interview, and she immediately, so I brought copies, and I gave them to everybody  on the panel, and halfway through the interview, she.  Let me just stop.  I mean, it started with Joe, they were talking about this girl, and Joe goes, because she's 
[01:59:00]  a fatso.  No.  And she was like, oh.  No, that's not what happened.  You were talking about plus size models, and you were going, they're called double X models,  and I said, no, they're called fatties.  And for some reason, everybody got weird about that.  Why the fuck?  I don't know.  Because the culture we live in, it stinks, man.  Because she was a hot blonde.  I couldn't tell.  I thought you were doing a character for a second.  No, but that is it.  Like, you do certain jokes, and people all back off, because they're afraid if they laugh,  they'll get in trouble for laughing. 
[01:59:30]  You know who backed off the hardest?  This guy's sitting right here.  Bob, when?  I thought you were talking about him.  Where's it fatties?  I didn't back off.  You went, uh, you went, you went, uh, okay.  I laughed my ass off.  You don't fucking ask.  Why do you think he backed off?  I didn't back off at all.  Hey.  No.  His fake laugh was killing me.  But Joe and Bobby here today, and they were on Red Eye.  Do we have the clips?  Do we have the clips from the Red Eye?  Yeah.  Because maybe we would play the clip that Joe's...  Wow. 
[02:00:00]  Instigator.  Stop.  I won't hold back when I'm on Red Eye this Friday.  Nice.  I won't hold back at all this Friday when I'm on Red Eye.  No, it's not.  I'm just kidding.  It's a great night, because we all go out afterwards and get hammied.  Is it this...  I'm out of town for...  God damn it.  Worst active regret ever.  Dad, let's go to the studio and watch.  We're probably going to go to that fucking outdoor place again.  Do some drinking out there.  What's the outdoor place?  It's a nice place we went to last time I was there.  It's downtown by Wall Street. 
[02:00:30]  It's fucking like a big alleyway with a couple of bars in there and shit, and it's outside.  Well, maybe I'll meet you there.  I'm in town this weekend.  Ooh.  Not!  Oh.  Oh, you gave me the not.  Not I am here.  So...  So do we have a clip of Bobby leaving Joe Hank?  Can we get that?  Have somebody in the back grab that real quick.  I don't like Joe's...  Joe's, first of all...  Which one was Joe's?  Joe's long fingers and arms during Red Eye.  Anyway, all you can see is his arms in front of my face, because when he talks, he has  to use his lawyer hands, and it's just his arms in front of my face. 
[02:01:00]  He's gesticulating a lot.  That's because I have no substance in what I'm saying on that show.  I've got to really sell it.  You've got to give him credit, though.  At one point, he just goes, I've got nothing.  I don't know.  Sometimes you read what they send you, the topics, and you just go, I have nothing on  this.  I've never had that happen.  I don't know.  A guy who wrecks things just to promote himself?  Well, what I'm saying is, while I read it, I say, I have nothing.  But then when it comes to the time, and they talk about it, right off the top of my head, 
[02:01:30]  oh, the magic.  The magic is there.  You do that jazz dance while you sing your quips?  Yeah.  Sammy Davis, Scoobius.  We wrote a book.  It's all red, like my hair.  Jesus.  Oh, Jesus.  Jesus Christ.  I don't know.  I write a book.  I'm doing movies.  I write a book about cheating.  It's a great fucking movie.  But you know, just like anything else, we're not in control of the book.  You know, it's the Illuminati. 
[02:02:00]  He runs everything.  That's what they do.  They give you a penny, and you write a book, and they give you nothing, and then they  nothing else.  The World Bank, they get their shit.  I was writing this about bankers.  When did relationships come in?  What the fuck is this?  Bill Burr is part of this project.  Where is Mr. Burr?  He's promoting on the West Coast for you guys?  He's coming in Friday for you guys.  All right.  We'll talk to Bill Burr.  Bill Burr, me and Joe wrote this.  It's based off of the short film, Cheat, which if you get the book, you can actually, you  get to see it, but you get to see it anyways, actually. 
[02:02:30]  It was supposed to be there.  I really liked that short film.  Thank you.  Go to CheatTheMansGuy.com.  We made a bunch of silly videos.  Me and Joe wrote a bunch of silly videos.  Nice.  Shot them.  We shot them, and then to promote the book.  Are we doing a real interview with these guys?  The movie's up there.  It's weird, right?  I hate this.  Yeah.  It's fucking weird.  Tell us a little about the book.  Please, tell us.  Who are some of the people in the book?  I've been on the show for fucking 18 years, and this is the first real interview ever.  I just found out you were from Boston. 
[02:03:00]  I'm kidding.  Dumbest look ever.  I'm kidding, too.  Fucking playing along with the bit douche.  Oh, thanks.  Oh, hey.  And you guys, thanks again for contributing stories to the book.  My pleasure.  Yeah.  I definitely went away.  Yeah, and we should explain that.  Everybody who gets the book, inside, in between all the chapters, we have true cheat stories.  And Colin, Voss, Keith, Robinson, Anthony. 
[02:03:30]  Some very funny stories.  Very funny stories.  Opie, they all gave us true cheat stories where they got caught cheating.  Yeah.  And they talk about it, and then we actually break it down, what they did right, what they  did wrong.  Oh, my God.  Anthony was definitely a fail.  I just had a complaint.  There was nothing right there from the second.  Jesus Christ.  It was like a scene from Cannonball Run.  It was so fucking ridiculous.  I don't even think it could be considered cheating.  Isn't cheating, you have to try to be secret? 
[02:04:00]  You have to try to fucking not get caught?  Your version of sneaking around was your girlfriend was in the pool, and you were in the hot tub.  That was terrible.  That was the worst.  You just love living dangerously, don't you?  That was terrible.  That's crazy.  I love that you hid her in a closet.  Hide her in the closet.  The Brady Bunch technique.  If I had a girl, would I put her in this stove?  All right, Anthony, I know the girl's in this stove.  Would I throw this lighted match in this stove? 
[02:04:30]  If I thought a Canadian was in there?  I'm fucking Canadian.  All right, I'll search for her out back.  Rich Voss fucking with his stupid chili dog.  His cheat story was fucking great.  What's his story about?  I know you don't want to give away too many of the stories because you want people to read the book, but...  His is...  I will say this much.  You've got to give one away.  To tease Voss's story, his story is fucking brilliant.  I mean, when he told us this story, we were like, gee, you should get a medal for this goddamn story. 
[02:05:00]  Like, it was...  I don't want to say...  It's such a good...  And it's right at the end.  I don't want to give away too much, but...  Yeah.  It's a fucking great story.  Voss, for as much as we make fun of him for saying he's dumb...  Yeah, he's a piece of shit.  He's fucking brilliant.  Did he have a brilliant cheat game?  He's fucking brilliant.  Yeah?  He's a brilliant hunk of shit.  Is what Voss is.  Nice.  It just goes to show you excel at the subjects in school that you have an interest in.  Right, right.  And in scumbaggery, Voss got a fucking A+.  This is a cool...  It's a cool little book to hold. 
[02:05:30]  Like, it just feels good to hold.  Yeah, man.  And it's got a nice red cover.  It just looks good.  It was well done.  What do you think about a shitter read?  Is it good shitter read?  Yeah.  Absolutely.  You can read one story, a couple stories, every shit.  You leave it there.  You're looking forward to your next dump so you can read a little more.  You can hold it with one hand.  Uh-huh.  Because a lot of times, a book, a hardcover big book is too hard to hold.  Oh, yeah.  Because then when you go to push your cock down to piss, the fucking book closes on your  fingers.  Anthony doesn't know.  His cock just hangs in the water while he fucking pisses. 
[02:06:00]  Yeah.  He has a heavy, heavy cocked guinea.  Anthony, when he fucking pisses, he doesn't hear the fucking stream sound.  Yeah.  He just...  It sounds like somebody put a garden hose in a pool.  That's not true.  Aside from, like, delicious cockcomia.  Yeah.  It's terrible.  It's a good-sized book.  It's definitely a guy's book.  And here's the thing, though.  At one point, they were trying to maybe get us to go down the urban outfitter's route 
[02:06:30]  with the cartoons and the graphs and the kooky and make it a little funner.  Right.  And we were like, fucking no.  It's not happening.  Yeah, yeah.  We're not putting any of that horse shit in here.  So it's pretty...  The stories and the storyline stands alone.  Don't need that wacky drawings.  Here's the thing is, a girl reviewed the book.  The first review we got was a woman.  And it sums up the book, though.  She was like, you're gonna...  If you have a sense of humor, you're gonna...  This book is hilarious.  But as a woman, you're gonna love these guys and fucking hate these guys. 
[02:07:00]  Really?  Yeah, during the book.  Which is good.  That's exactly what we wanted.  From women.  Yeah, because women don't want to know that this shit actually happens.  Because it could happen to them.  Yeah.  They hate that.  But I also think that it's...  Is there a message here, guys?  There's a message here.  There's a message.  Is there a message here?  Is there a message here?  I think...  It's all fun and stuff, but do we have a message to give to the people?  What about the children?  Right.  How does this affect the children?  Aren't you worried kids are gonna read this, Bob? 
[02:07:30]  Hopefully.  Jimmy reached over and touched Bob's arm when he said that, too.  I mean, what kind of a message is this?  Are you trying to say cheating is fun?  Yeah.  No, we're not saying...  Is that what you're saying here?  You're glorifying cheating.  Why would you glorify cheating?  Let's give him a hard interview.  If you were a tree, what kind of tree would you boys be?  Now, guys, obviously cheating isn't very moral, and it hurts people.  Why glorify it like this?  Cheating does not hurt people.  Cheating helps people in some cases.  Come on, Bob!  Just shut your face, you old man.  You gotta throw that. 
[02:08:00]  That's a lie.  Just get old, man.  Come on, Bob!  You may sell that to these other radio shows, but we don't go for that here.  You know better than that.  What is this?  You know better than this.  You disgust me.  Get out!  You have to think of the effect this is gonna have on people.  Now, why would you glorify something like this?  I don't mind Jimmy's touch.  Edgar's touch makes me want to fucking...  Oh, with the nails?  Oh, shit.  There it is.  Oh, fuck.  I was bending down to go out last night to tie my shoes, and I always...  That's, by the way, the miracle of that statement. 
[02:08:30]  Sorry.  Bob's trying.  Bob's trying.  I pick my leg up onto a chair, and I had to text asshole, because I went, Jerry Shepardini.  Nice.  Jerry fucking Shepardini.  I sing it all the time.  He's a star.  Oh, God.  Well, this girl last night on Red Ice, she was...  They definitely take an immediate...  Joe was funny.  He had a great line, too.  She literally trashed the book.  And he goes, oh, that's a good review after 25 seconds of reviewing the book. 
[02:09:00]  Oh, man.  Yeah.  She takes the book.  She goes like this.  She goes, what the...  What is this about the milkshake getting thrown...  And I go, what?  And she goes, it's in your book.  And I go, sorry, I don't have the goddamn blurb you flipped to on page 67 memorized.  Oh, man.  Can you give us more than a 25-second flip through before you start judging the book?  Did you point out...  And then she...  Oh, well, we're going to...  She goes, she goes, who's this for, men or women?  Women.  I go, well, it says a man's guy right on the cover. 
[02:09:30]  And then she flips to this.  The next one she flips to, put your phone on Helen Keller mode.  Really, guys?  She said that?  And then Joe goes, yeah, it's called silent mode.  Oh, God.  I was like, it's a joke.  Yeah, you got to hammer her.  Like, you got to hammer...  Well, first of all, it's like, if you're going to get mad at a book, why don't you start  with Mein Kampf?  Why don't you bring that on and get really angry about it?  Wait a minute.  Not a throwaway read like this.  Not a comedy book.  I mean, that's a struggle and writes about it, and you've got to give him shit. 
[02:10:00]  Why?  Because it was too short.  Guys, you want to be offended by a comedy book, go get Jeff Foxworthy's book.  Oh, shit.  That's an offensive comedy book.  Does he have a comedy book now?  Sure he does.  I'm sure he does.  Bill Engvall's got six or seven.  Your answer should be, by the way, is this for men or women?  It's for both because it's funny.  It's a man's guide.  It is both.  But it is for both.  It's not a book just for men.  It's for both.  Because women know that men do this shit.  It's like you're seeing...  They always complain that men aren't honest. 
[02:10:30]  This is a book where men are being honest about rotten stuff we've done and how we've gotten  caught.  So don't say you want honest men and then get angry because we make fun of it.  We're honest and make fun of it.  It's a peek into a man's mind, too.  Yeah.  And we're not telling people to go cheat.  I like that.  We're not saying don't cheat and be...  Oh, good.  Because that wrecks families, Bobby.  Yeah, Bob.  What about children growing up in single-parent households, Bob?  Go ahead.  But if you do cheat, it's going to...  You know, just don't get caught and ruin your fucking life. 
[02:11:00]  Hey, this amazing interview is going great, but I want to get the spaceman on the internet  because he's going to jump soon.  Oh, yeah.  We're doing a live...  You heard about the spaceman?  At 9.30.  I thought it was like 9.30.  But people are saying there's already streaming some shit that we can check out.  Is he jumping with our book in his hand off of the fucking thing?  That would be good.  Bobby, he is jumping from 20...  It's the highest jump.  How many miles?  It's 120,000 feet, and he's trying to break the speed of sound by falling...  Oh, hi.  I got my helicopter.  Oh, sure.  That fucking is the most amazing.  Wait, 120,000? 
[02:11:30]  Yes, it's almost 18,000 feet higher than Joe...  Whatever his name was.  Kittinger did in 1950, whatever, 1960.  My math sucks today.  How many miles is that?  About...  125 in a 12 is 20 miles.  Professor Kumia.  Yes, sir.  What is...  What's the height when you become weightlessness, when you get into space?  That would be space.  I believe that's 60 miles up you start...  That's it, huh?  Actually, they technically say that 60 miles up is space.  Is that 300,000 feet? 
[02:12:00]  I'm not sure.  Well, 60 times 5 is 300,000.  I'm not going to conversion.  But isn't that weird, though, that this guy's 120,000 and it's pitch black, the sky, when  you see where he is.  Yeah.  Like, he's looking out at the sky and it's black.  But he's like 180,000 feet.  Like, he's not even halfway to space.  Short of space, yeah.  That's amazing.  But boy, that turns into space real quick, I think.  That's real.  Once you get up that high, you look up, you don't see that blue sky anymore. 
[02:12:30]  No, you don't even look at when you see down.  That's fucking stars.  So what is he trying to do?  It's creepy.  He's jumping out of this balloon like Kittinger did.  For what?  Well, he wants to break the record of the high jump, highest balloon flight, highest jump,  and speed of sound.  He wants to be the only free-falling human to voluntarily break the speed of sound.  Voluntarily.  It's live on YouTube and it's on, the link is wired.com.  Do you have to prepare for that?  Do you have to prepare for that for years? 
[02:13:00]  Or is that something that, five years.  If we put a suit on you and you threw you up there, you could just jump out.  No, because you have to know how to fall so you don't spin out of control.  He's been at it for five years.  You've got to be in shape.  There you go.  I got it.  And you've got to not shake your pants.  All right, you got it.  Yeah, good.  What the hell's that?  It's on the ground.  What's the Red Bull mission?  Is it the thing's on the ground?  See, we have a red book.  Oh, wait.  It would have been a perfect match.  It would have been an excellent tie-in.  We could have gave him a fucking red outfit with cheat on it.  Dude, if this guy fucking launches the balloon at 930, 
[02:13:30]  he's not going to reach that altitude for fucking hours.  So it's not going to be an hour.  He ain't jumping at 930.  It takes a long time to get up to 120.  In a fucking balloon.  That takes a while.  How long?  How long?  A long fucking time.  Did you ever let a balloon go into the sky and those fuckers go up fast?  Yeah, there you go, Joe.  You tell them.  15, 20 minutes tops.  Tops.  Let's take a bet.  Let's take a bet.  Holy shit.  But that has to take fucking two or three hours, I would say. 
[02:14:00]  Sure.  Sure.  Where's the balloon?  I can't tell because there's a lot of graphics on the ground.  Are they doing Sandusky live?  He's being sentenced at 9.  Oh, he arrives at court.  Oh, he's being sentenced today?  Yeah.  Oh, shit.  And he is denying.  I think the odds are against probation.  Isn't it ironic that he's being sentenced the same time the balloon's going up?  That's pretty ironic.  And the same time this book's coming out?  Nothing to do with each other.  Not ironic.  Yes, this book does tie into Jerry Sandusky a lot.  Does it?  Yes.  This is all how Jerry Sandusky got his victims to fucking... 
[02:14:30]  Oh, buy the book.  Buy the book.  Yes, get that book.  That would have been funny if you put that forward by Jerry Sandusky.  You should have just done that forward.  Who did the forward?  Nobody.  Nobody.  We did.  We did it.  Fuck them.  Yeah, your first book, you don't get a lot of people going, can we do the forward?  Why don't you ask them?  They don't ask you.  Huh?  No, I know.  People are a little fucking scared of this book, too.  Why?  Why?  Because of the content.  You know what I mean? 
[02:15:00]  Cheating.  I mean, instantly a woman picks this up.  And why?  They're like, why?  Why would you do this?  They're instantly offended without even reading it.  Any comic.  I can see actors.  Any comic scared of this is a fucking pussy.  You're a pussy.  It's your fucking job to do this, to talk about stuff.  What the fuck?  This is a dumb, fun book.  How could we scare this?  There were some people that backed away.  Really?  I mean, I can see...  Well, we want names, Joe DeRosa.  No, no, no, no, no.  But why'd they say they backed away? 
[02:15:30]  Why'd they say they backed away?  Well, just because...  Look, I get it.  The career...  I mean, look, you're associated with this, and then...  What happens with this book?  Who knows?  What?  Who knows?  What?  What do you mean?  Who knows what happens with this?  What do you associate with the book?  It's a fucking book.  What do you mean?  Who knows?  It's a comedy book.  Yeah, that's...  I agree with you.  It'll be in the comedy section, won't it?  Who the fuck would be afraid to be associated with a comedy book?  What is it right now on Amazon?  We were...  We have to get in the top 100.  I wonder what it is right now.  Yeah, let's find out.  Because I guess the launch isn't until 9.30. 
[02:16:00]  So that means the balloon starts going up at 9.30?  Or is he fucking...  Or the jump...  It says earliest launch, 8 a.m.  Yeah, the launch is 9...  The balloon goes up at 9.30.  Earliest lunch?  9.30.  I'm hungry.  Get off me, Edgar.  Anthony, can you shoot Edgar's hand?  Aw, Edgar.  It's those nails that...  Yeah, he has those baby nails.  Baby nails.  So where is it on Amazon?  Yeah, where do you find the number, Bob?  I couldn't find it.  He has monkey fingernails. 
[02:16:30]  That's terrible.  Where do you find the number?  I don't know where to...  It's at right here.  Right here.  All right, right now we're 530 overall.  The fuck?  Are we really?  Get it up there.  We need to be in the...  Refresh.  We need to be, when this book comes out, in the top 100.  You're number 29.  It comes out when the balloon launches.  You're number 27 in literature and fiction, number 29 in humor and entertainment, number  38 in parenting and relationships.  You're in a couple different categories. 
[02:17:00]  Yeah.  It's hard, though, also, because this time...  530.  Let's move that number.  It's kind of hard to...  Because you're competing with a lot of political books, and any time, especially...  Because mine came out four years ago around the election.  I love a good spin.  It's a hard time, because it's everyone...  So everyone is fucking writing books about whether it's Obama or the economy and all  that shit.  We want it.  But is that a good number?  530, not really.  Where were you a couple days ago?  We were in like 2,000 yesterday.  Yeah, then you said...  As opposed to good...  Joe, we were at 250,000 four days ago. 
[02:17:30]  Yeah, 530.  530.  We got to help this a lot a little bit.  That will help with...  Are you guys doing any signings?  We're doing a big show, the 16th, at the Village Underground.  Book signings?  Yeah.  Okay.  Let me finish.  It's a book signing at the Village Underground.  Colin's going to be there.  Keith's going to be there.  Voss is going to be there.  We're doing a show.  Two shows.  We're showing the movie, and we're doing a Q&A and a book signing at the Village Underground.  That would be a good fucking night.  It's a great night.  That's a great night.  Tickets are on sale at Laugh...  What is it? 
[02:18:00]  Laugh Stub.  Laugh Stub.  They should have had you do book signings and bookstores.  We got that info on our Facebook page, Hopi and Anthony.  We should do what?  Book signings and bookstores.  They don't do that anymore, Jimmy.  There's no bookstores.  We fought for that.  Oh, you tried to get it.  We fought for that.  It's a fucking...  You got to get creative.  It's crazy.  Yeah, we had to come up with this show.  We actually put this gig we're doing.  Right.  We put that together.  Yeah, I guess it's harder because there's so few bookstores...  Athletes do them, major actors.  It is hard to get them, though.  I think in the last few years, a lot of bookstores have shut down. 
[02:18:30]  Yeah.  Yeah, I guess it's a lot harder to get them.  They just gave...  What was it?  3.5 million to that fat girl on HBO?  What's her name?  For Girls.  Yeah, she has a...  For Girls.  3.5 million.  But she's pretty talented.  I like that show.  3.5 million worth?  For what?  She gave her fans a lot of books.  Popular show.  3.5 book advance?  Yeah.  Damn.  That's big.  That's a big book advance.  That's big, Bobby.  Well, we want to thank the authors of Cheat for coming by today. 
[02:19:00]  Thank you so much.  Good luck with the book.  Now let's talk about balloons.  I thought 5.30 was a good number.  I mean, out of all the books in the world...  It's not Jesus.  Now you get it.  It's Jesus, Joe.  Joe, it's a good number.  It's okay.  Jesus.  Jesus, Joe.  We will get the number higher.  Hit refresh.  We will get the number higher.  5.30, it's fucking great.  We will get the number higher.  Don't worry.  Jesus, Joe.  5.30, what do you want?  Jesus Christ, you're not in the top ten anymore.  I ain't shit.  We're still at 5.30.  Well, we almost moved the needle.  I felt like we were going to move the needle that time.  Well, they might not update immediately like that. 
[02:19:30]  This show...  Yeah.  Lost it in the top.  This show will make it...  No.  No.  You already mind?  This show didn't lose its heat.  We still have heat?  No.  I was here the other day...  Nice.  When you were out, and the fucking thousands of people just jumped into that stupid chat  room...  Oh, God.  ...and ruined a fucking show.  What did I miss?  They'll be quick to lambast the Facebook page and shit.  Then we get numbers.  When it comes to them buying something...  No.  Did Daryl Hammond actually say, great book, very funny? 
[02:20:00]  Yeah.  We're all going to hell?  Yes.  How about you read some of the quotes, Bobby?  Yeah.  We got David Tell.  Usually, I think reading is kind of fruity.  But this book got me hard.  What a great summer beach read.  If the beach is in Haiti.  Oh, shit.  David Tell.  Ah, Colin Quinn.  Uncompromising and funny.  Read it, even though it will destroy all hope.  Colin Quinn.  Mm-hmm.  It makes you lose faith.  You read one, Joe.  It makes you lose faith in humanity, doesn't it?  This book, because people think it's going to be just a fucking goof. 
[02:20:30]  It's a real book.  I mean, we really talk about cheating in a real way.  It's a real movie, Jack.  It's a real look at society.  That's the funny thing.  I was talking about this yesterday with whoever I was talking to.  I can't remember.  But it was so funny, because people go, I go, yeah, it's like a real book.  And the person was like, yeah, well, what else would it be?  I go, no, you don't understand.  I go, every asshole that comes to my house, I have this sitting on my table.  Yeah.  They pick it up, and they go, oh, so this is the book. 
[02:21:00]  This is great.  And they flip all through it.  Then they look at the spine, and they go, Simon & Schuster.  Oh, this is like a real book.  It's like a real book.  It's like, yeah, what do you think, I fucking printed these myself, asshole?  I see a mistake, though.  Uh-oh.  And if you want to know why, this is what's going to hurt.  Uh-oh.  And I don't want to be a terrain of the parade.  But the names at the end here, they have the author's names on the side of the book.  They have Burr, DeRosa, and Kelly.  Because those are the three.  But between DeRosa and Kelly, there's a comma after DeRosa before the word and. 
[02:21:30]  Which you're never supposed to have a comma before the word and.  No, not true.  So I think it's all right to wrap this segment up.  Yeah.  Why is that not true?  You might be right.  No, that's not true.  Why?  Because you put a comma.  If you're listing things, you can put a comma before and to signify that this is the last  item of the list.  However, if you don't put the comma, it insinuates that DeRosa and Kelly were a pair.  In other words, Burr, comma.  Oh, there you go.  DeRosa and Kelly worked together as a team. 
[02:22:00]  You know what?  I'm glad you corrected me.  Because I've used commas like that before.  And it feels right to put a comma sometimes before and.  We'll be taking your punctuation calls.  I'm glad you said that.  Well, it's like book radio.  What's this guy a fucking grandma fucking teacher?  I love DeRosa.  DeRosa actually perked up.  No, no, no.  You're wrong.  But I'm glad he was right.  I'd rather be humiliated here and continue the way I was. 
[02:22:30]  Guys, I'd like to plug the other book that I wrote.  Oh, which one was that?  It's called Grammar Faggot.  It's called Grammar Faggot.  That'd be a great book.  It's good.  We should take a break.  You guys are hanging around, right?  When's the next interview today?  It was with Sam on the after show.  Nice.  Jesus.  How are we going to move this number?  We've got to move this 530 number.  Before we go to break, let's see where we're at right now. 
[02:23:00]  Well, a few people are already buying it.  I just checked Twitter.  People are buying it.  Hang on.  $10?  That's it?  Nope.  530.  530.  530.  530.  That was great.  Wow.  The show has lost its luster.  Maybe they update it every two hours.  Maybe a lot of people didn't think you were going to sign.  The show has lost its luster.  Maybe.  Let's see.  Oh, boy.  I was trying something else that might work for you guys.  Not quite.  Let's see now.  And we're at what?  Oh, is that where we're at there? 
[02:23:30]  No.  Not the page three.  No, that's Fifty Shades of Grey.  Sorry.  What's this?  That's, uh...  I was hoping for something better.  I clicked the Kindle e-book, but it's number 6027 in e-books, so...  But it says we're number seven in the Kindle store.  What's that mean?  Parenting and families.  Well, that's what we're trying to help.  We're number 66 in humor.  We are...  Are you all right?  Oh, man.  I'm tired, Obi.  I'm very tired. 
[02:24:00]  It's got to be the fans right now.  We're going to miss this show right now.  Yep.  And it's going to push it to number one today.  This book is going to go number one.  We promise.  Because of the people.  Yes.  Grassroots effort.  The millions and millions of 0-8 fans.  Oh, wow.  Hulk Hogan's here today.  Is he?  Can we see his cock?  I took a piss next to him.  I want it to look so bad.  Why didn't you?  Got his big thermos dick?  It was just me and him in the bathroom.  I don't know, man.  What's he going to do?  What's he going to do to you?  I don't know.  Besides fuck your face.  Body slam you, yeah. 
[02:24:30]  Did you take a picture with him?  I already got one.  Hey, speaking of pictures, Muhammad Ali.  We never talked about it yesterday.  Fucking Jimmy met Muhammad Ali.  That's ridiculous.  What was he like?  I'd rather talk to Muhammad Ali about his experience meeting this little fucking white supremacist.  He was very quiet.  He's, uh...  Wait, walk us through it, though.  You went up to his hotel suite or something?  I was supposed to go to his...  Who came to the door?  All that stuff.  Well, I know someone...  My buddy Craig runs his company.  Yeah.  Or used to run his company.  So Jonathan, my manager, goes,  Hey, yeah, we'll get to meet Ali. 
[02:25:00]  Come to this event that he's doing.  It's a charity event.  So I'm like, all right.  Yeah, I was very excited.  And I went out and I spent $2,700 on a suit.  Wow.  I've never done that in my life.  You spent $2,700 for a suit to meet Ali in?  Well, again, I'll use it for Leto.  I'll wear it other places.  But I never bought an amazing suit in my life.  I've never done that.  So I did it one time.  I'm like, I'm going to go out and buy a great fucking...  For this event.  Because it's a black tie event.  Or black tie optional.  So, uh...  The fucking day of the event, 
[02:25:30]  Craig is texting Jonathan going,  Yeah, it doesn't look good.  I haven't heard back from Lonnie, who's Muhammad twice.  And that's when Jimmy was...  That day was when Jimmy was on the show  saying this is the most disappointing thing  that happened in his life.  And Colin called up.  Well, this is...  No, this is the day before.  Oh, okay.  The day before.  Because this was...  As the event was approaching,  8 o'clock,  he was doing the meet and greet before.  I was going to stop in and get a quick picture.  And, uh...  It's like 7 o'clock.  And I'm like, it's not happening.  And I had my fucking shoes and pants on.  Oh, you know he must have been out of his mind.  Jonathan even walked from my place 
[02:26:00]  down to the Mandarin Oriental  where it was being held  and looked around  to see if we could buy tickets.  Jonathan was so great.  And it didn't happen.  So I was manically depressed.  I had my heart set on Ali.  And I went out with Jonathan to eat dinner.  Like, I'm depressed.  If a girl pulls down her pants  and it's not cut versus cut,  that's just where I feel ripped off.  This wasn't a financial thing.  This was just an emotional heartbreak.  I picture you at this point  like ripping the suit apart.  This is a stupid suit!  No, I was just like... 
[02:26:30]  I was like...  This guy, like...  I'm like, did he lie to me?  Like, it was so...  Fucking...  Like, it was so casual  the way he was like,  yeah, she's not getting back to me.  He's just telling me like,  ah, it didn't work out.  And you're like,  this is the worst thing  that's happened in my life.  I'm like, he must not be  in real communication with us  because did he make this up?  Like, this guy was like a cool guy.  I'm like, why would he do this to me?  I'm like, maybe he really hates me.  I was fucking panicking.  Maybe he really hates me.  So Jonathan goes to the airport 
[02:27:00]  the next morning.  This is after the radio show  when Colin called it  at Lambace to be for my tweet.  I just said,  the most disappointing night of my life.  I'm about to work out at the gym  and Jonathan calls me.  He goes, look, Craig called.  He said it's on for today  at 1245 at his hotel.  Wow.  It turns out  that Craig just knows them so well  that to him it was like,  ah, we can't do it tonight.  We'll do it tomorrow.  Like, that's how he...  He looked at it like  I would look at taking them  to meet stupid Bob and Joe.  So...  Wait a minute.  Wait a minute.  All right.  A stupid Bob and Joseph.  So they fucking... 
[02:27:30]  Thank you.  So...  Due to respect.  We meet at the Mandarin Oriental  in the lobby.  Me and Jonathan  leaves the airport  and comes back.  And Craig walks in  and we're all just bantering.  And then he goes,  all right, it's time.  Let's just go up.  So we fucking take the elevator up  to the 40th floor of the Mandarin.  And we walk in  and Craig knocks on the door  and I hear a woman  say, hold on.  And Ollie's wife  opens the door.  Wow.  So Craig has me walk in first.  Go ahead, go ahead, go ahead.  So I walk into this living room area  and he went,  hey, where's Mohammed? 
[02:28:00]  Oh, no.  And they shot you in the head.  I said, hey,  this must bring back  and there's a bunch  of stacked up chairs.  I speak with a fucking pit bull  back then.  Just blast him in the face.  Right enough for you  and your celebrities.  But...  Shoot him in the head.  But I walk into this fucking room  and Ollie is just sitting there  fucking watching television.  I walk in,  there's Mohammed Ali.  It's fucking...  What was he watching?  Daytime TV,  Anderson Cooper's show.  I think we were watching  like gay porno. 
[02:28:30]  They were watching  Bill Burr's comedy special.  Oh, no,  he was watching mine  and fucking scowling.  But he's really...  He doesn't talk much.  We were there for 45 minutes.  Me,  Jonathan, Craig,  and Mohammed, his wife.  So that's gotta be awkward  if he's not talking.  No, not at all.  So were you talking  to his wife?  Very comfortable, actually.  You were talking around him  kind of,  one of those things?  Yeah, but he was...  What happened was...  You don't think he really  played up his sickness  because you were there?  It might have made things worse.  But he...  I sat next to him  and he was...  He was just fucking quiet. 
[02:29:00]  There's no tremors at all.  Like, you know,  we've all seen footage of him  like shaking badly.  Zero tremors.  And so it's like  whatever medication he's on  I think makes him very still.  And...  But it probably makes his life  a lot easier  because he can relax  and he can eat.  And, you know,  he eats himself.  It's not like he's fucking helpless.  But he talked a little bit.  But he was like...  He was whispering.  And there was times  when we were all talking.  His wife's an amazing  conversationalist.  So it was not uncomfortable at all.  She's probably been through this 
[02:29:30]  for many years.  How old is Ali?  Ali's like 71 or 72, I think.  But he fucking...  He would chime in once in a while  but very softly  or through gestures.  But he looked...  I mean, he looks frail  but he looked so much better  than I thought he would.  That was the biggest thing.  It was like,  he looked healthier.  He didn't look sick.  Like, you know he has...  He's been getting his ass  kicked by Parkinson's  for fucking 20 years.  So I was amazed  that he looked as young  as he did  and he had no tremors.  Which I couldn't believe.  But he was...  He just kind of ate fruit 
[02:30:00]  and was like...  He was just kind of  chilling out.  And we talked about the charity.  They have a charity  which is...  Oh, these fruit shits  must be fucking amazing.  He...  They have a charity  they're promoting  so I fucking said  I would help promote the charity.  You know what I mean?  Yeah, he's Ali.  All right.  Have a little respect.  Have a little fucking respect.  Would you please?  It's Ali.  It's a moment  so of course it's uncomfortable.  I still look calm.  I still call him catches.  I gotta ask you this.  Did he say anything 
[02:30:30]  that you regret?  Not at all.  Did he say something  a little douchey  like oh you're the greatest  or anything like that?  No, I didn't.  I couldn't.  I said hi champ.  I mean what do you...  It's Ali.  You didn't rhyme.  That's not bad.  No.  You didn't rhyme at all?  You didn't say anything  like you were feeling it?  I didn't know...  Thank you for what you have done  for humanity.  I said...  I got a picture with him.  He took pictures.  Yeah.  And again he's very frail  but he did the fucking fist...  The best is...  They're like Muhammad  would you do the glove thing  and that's what boxers do.  They put their fist up  and he did. 
[02:31:00]  And the angle I have  from the front  he doesn't look  is good  but Jonathan took  a couple of shots  of us from the side  while we were taking pictures  and the side view  you can see how healthy  he looks.  From the front  there's something  about the flesh  where his eyes look wide  and it looks like  he's out of it  but from the side  he's absolutely  not out of it.  It's just a better angle.  But no,  I just said...  I asked him to sign  a glove  and he did.  His handwriting  is very frail.  It was an isotoner.  Yeah, it was a first baseman's bit 
[02:31:30]  because I didn't have  a boxing glove  but he signed it.  I was corny.  I was like,  thanks champ,  I love you.  I told him I loved him.  You said you loved him?  Yes!  I said that.  It's Ali.  You don't love him.  I do.  You don't love him.  He was the ultimate  photo for me.  There was none  higher than him for me.  Under Ozzy for you.  Hold on,  let me ask these guys.  Yeah, Ali.  Really?  Me and Jimmy  had this dumb photo thing  going on for a while  because I got a picture 
[02:32:00]  with President Clinton.  Does his picture  with Ali Trump  absolutely?  I think so too.  Absolutely.  Yeah, because Ali's time  was Clinton.  Clinton was a president  but you know what I mean?  Ali was known  all over the fucking world.  So is Clinton.  I know.  I'm sure we know  American presidents  but I don't know  in the same way.  I think also  Clinton's probably  more available  for photographs  believe it or not  than Ali is at this point.  Yeah.  I think it's probably  easier to get  a Clinton photo  than it is in Ali.  Didn't Ali have  his own car?  He made his own car  at one point? 
[02:32:30]  I don't know.  Yeah, I think  he actually  produced a car.  I wish I had asked him  a couple of questions though.  A Pontiac?  Nah, I forget what it is.  Sam.  Right?  It's an acronym joke  from long ago.  I wish I wanted to ask.  I should have asked him  who hit harder  like fucking  Sonny Liston  or Ernie Shavers.  Just like questions  I would love to ask Ali.  You fucking asshole.  What about George Foreman?  Foreman hit pretty hard.  Ernie Shavers did hit hard.  He didn't hit as hard  as Shavers I don't think.  You don't think?  No.  From what I've heard  Ernie Shavers  was the hardest hitting guy 
[02:33:00]  in heavyweight history  but it was amazing  to sit with him.  And I wasn't as nervous  as I thought I would be.  I never knew  when I cried  when I met him.  You don't know  what kind of reaction  you're going to have.  I didn't know.  That would be hilarious.  You just start  weeping openly.  People do know.  Ali just musters up  enough energy  to call you a faggot.  Or just point the door  and say get out.  Yeah, just get out.  I'm crying over here.  But I didn't know.  I'm crying over here.  You can act like a man.  I'm kidding.  You signed a glove  through your tears.  Through your tears. 
[02:33:30]  Fuck, you get a hold of yourself.  But yeah, no I didn't.  I was very relaxed.  You're not a fucking idiot.  It's the dumb hoe.  I was surprisingly collected.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Good for you, Jimmy.  I know that's a big thing for you.  I just wish I had talked to him more.  I would have loved to met Ali.  I'm not going to lie.  Of course.  Anybody.  Jimmy's like heroes  and stuff growing up  mean they mean a lot to you.  Yeah.  They really do.  I mean everybody has  people that inspire them  and heroes that you watch.  And I am that hero  to many people.  And you, yes you are.  I'll just assume  that you called me  and my phone was like 
[02:34:00]  you know acting off.  Yeah.  Oh.  Dude, I found out.  Did anyone get a call  to join Jim Norton  for the big Ali?  Nobody would have.  Not even fucking.  If Foreman was in town  I wouldn't have called him.  But it was one of those things  where I didn't think  it was going to happen  and now all of a sudden  Jonathan calls me  from the airport.  It's happening.  It's happening.  It's going down.  I had my glove with me  just in case.  I would like to hear  the conversation  after he left  between Ali and his wife.  Oh God.  Who's that cracker?  If you ever  bring any motherfucker  like that in my house again  I will whip your ass. 
[02:34:30]  His wife  is fucking amazing.  She's one of the best  conversationalists ever.  The great Ali now.  The great Muhammad Ali.  She's freckly though.  Yeah.  She's freckly.  Why did that little  cancer girl  Why was that cancer girl  so annoying?  Why did he just stare at me?  He didn't talk.  Why were her eyes so wide?  Yeah.  I wish I would have  asked boxing questions.  That's hilarious.  Holy shit.  That's so fucking funny. 
[02:35:00]  That's hilarious.  I should have  asked more questions.  Why that little  cancer girl  You know I always  want to help  the Make-A-Wish  foundation.  That little  cancer girl  had what she had.  She had a beard  that was patchy.  That's right.  It must have been  her cancer of her ovaries  and none of that  female hormones  so she grew that  beard ago.  I didn't know  Katie Lang had cancer.  Bitch don't look right  with no hair. 
[02:35:30]  Holy shit.  It's a moment for Jimmy.  It's a big moment.  Why can't we be happy  for Jimmy?  But it is make fun of.  It is fair game  to be made fun of.  How did it end?  It's the greatest photo  all of it again.  How did it end?  It was just time to wrap up.  We all sensed that  there was no  they had other  I think other people  coming too.  So we all just said  hey and then Muhammad  I think was going to  go lie down for a while  or nap or whatever  and she's like  they want to take  some pictures  so I took a couple  with him  and they got it  oh the best  is he did the fist thing  for me  like the Caligula 
[02:36:00]  and I got a picture  of my manager  of stupid Jonathan  puts his fist up  and Ali's hands are up  so it's so fucking awesome.  Oh that's great.  With the picture  from the side  you can see Ali  kind of smirking  and he doesn't smile  much anymore  and again it's just  he's very very stiff  from the fucking medicine.  Good for you.  Yeah I was  that's a biggie  that's great  that's a biggie  that's bigger than Ozzy  for Jimmy  not many are bigger  than Ozzy for Jimmy  Oh boy  What happened?  What happened? 
[02:36:30]  Oh boy  What happened?  Did you just get in trouble?  Three simple letters  H-I-V  What happened?  Oh God  Jesus  Pause  Pause  What happened?  Jimmy just checked his phone  and he's like  oh geez  so he walked out  so we're just speculating  he's got an app  for it at this point  He's got an app  Jimmy's AIDS app  There's a button  contact all of your  sexual partners  Jimmy jizzes  into the mouthpiece  of the iPhone  and it tests  gives him a reading  It's like checking 
[02:37:00]  your blood  What happened?  Positive  I have my spare key  with me  and our lady  couldn't get in  so I had to have  security finger  Me and Jimmy  have a lady  My AIDS app  even talks to me  You have AIDS  You have full-blown AIDS  Full-blown AIDS  You get the full-blown AIDS  Your T-cell count  is one  Your belly button  is huge  Your fingernails

I'm on 10th Avenue  Northbound  and I'm behind the bus  and the sign says  Call 9-1-1  I thought it was  a stolen bus 
[02:39:30]  I didn't know  what was happening  there could have been  hostages  I mean we all saw  that Keanu Reeves movie  I'm on the phone  with a 9-1-1  and this fucking dummy  is where are you now?  I said I'm northbound  on 47th Street  on 10th Avenue  Okay you're on  now where are you now?  I said 48th Street  Where are you now?  49th Street  And you said it's heading  which way sir?  Northbound  The only way you can go  on 10th Avenue  We're so irritated  with these dummies  So we make the left  on 57th Street  We go down to 11th Avenue  I go look he's making  a left on 11th Avenue  It's a yellow light  so the bus slows down  and then shoots  through the light  and leaves me  at the red light 
[02:40:00]  I knew that the bus  did that on purpose  I'm like this guy  knows I'm behind him  Now we're going  southbound again  so I call back  No one is doing it  How long does it take  to get a squad car  on fucking 11th Avenue  So I pull up next to it  and it's really dark  on the bus  and I just see  there's a black dude  I'm on the phone  I'm like I'm looking  at the guy  and he's just a black dude  but he's not dressing  a bus driver  and I know that  he's stealing this bus  I'm northbound now  and he's behind me  and he's like  what street?  I'm like  Now we're passing  40th Street  The woman was like  where was he before? 
[02:40:30]  10th and 11th  but then he came down  11th and now  we went up 10th  He's probably going  to turn it off  because you're going  to lose him  So then I was just like  fuck this shit  and I drive away  and he pulls away  slowly and starts to drive  and I'm like  you know what  forget it  you know what  he just turned it off  he just turned it off  we lost him  and he probably  turned into the bus depot  Sirius XM  It's the Opie and Anthony Show

[02:49:30]  Like you find a hair extension  Or a scrunchie  Do you tell guys  How to get around that?  Well, here's the thing  We actually say  You've got to take an hour  Shower and scour  You can't just  You can't just  Have a girl  Mess around  And then  You know  Think that you  You have to  You have to clean the place  Like you're Dexter  Yes  Has that suit  Right  It lines coming out of yarn  To where things went  I never understood that  This entire book  Is just highly offensive  Every word of it

[02:52:00]  And then  She goes  You want your phone  And she grabs it  And looks at the front of it  You're like  And then you see her face  And then she'll come over  And hand it to you  Oh it's okay  You know how to tell  If you guys cheating also  If ladies  I'll blow up a little bit  Of a spot  Smells cock  Yeah  Smells like vagina  That's all you gotta do  If he announces  Who the fuck is calling  Every time  Like that's a guilt  Not guilt thing  Where you're like  Oh yeah yeah  It's about Bill

[03:05:30]  And we went to  Northern Italy  Like to Piedmont  And I've never  I mean the food  Was incredible  But they had this  Pasta with  Just simple pasta  With mushrooms  And then truffles  On top  Oh my god  Nice  Is the difference  Between American  Italian food  And Italy  Italian food  Like really that big  Because I've heard  It's not really similar  It's not  It's more similar  Now than it used to be  Because before  It was just a lot  Of like really heavy sauce  And like kind of  Really gross stuff  You know  But now it's  People understand  A little bit more 
[03:06:00]  What you know  Real Italian food is  Yeah  It's simpler over there  Their food is  Just kind of simple  Yeah  And the portions  Are like human  You know  I suppose  Yeah  It really has  Become that here  Like people just feel  That if you don't get  A huge portion  You're getting ripped off  It's a gimmick  To get people in the restaurant  From pasta with every meal  Yeah  You don't see the words  Family style in Italy  No  Yeah  Family style is for one person  After all the vendettas  What's the name of the cookbook 
[03:06:30]  This is true  It's called  The Ducci Family Cookbook  Nice  Nice  I actually  Ducci family style cookbook  Me and Joe  Just came out with a book today  This is our book  That just came out today  Oh Jesus  This is wonderful  I'll bring this to my wife  Great  That's right  That's something  You want laying around  Oh Bobby  Stanley I apologize  The sociopath's approach  It's great  We apologize  They're two local comedians  We don't really know that  Local comedians  Authors  And Billy Burgess  That's our first day 
[03:07:00]  Is being authors  That's fantastic  Take that with you  Can I take this with you  That's for you  Absolutely  I can't wait  To walk out in the lobby  And we see that  Just ripped up  And thrown into the  You see a burning book  It's in the toilet  So you guys are having  A good time aren't you  Yeah  This is like a great job  It really is  It doesn't suck  You just come in  The worst part is just  Getting up early  But then after that  It's all downhill  What time do you have to be up  Five-ish 
[03:07:30]  Oh yeah  I drive in from Long Island  So then I gotta deal with  Those idiots on the expressway  But not too bad  And then once you're in  It's just goofing around  So yeah  It's not like a real work  I had a real job  So you know  Don't look at me like  You know  I've never had one of those  Silver spoon  You probably did  Before acting there was nothing  What did you do  You must have had a trade  I attended bar  I painted apartments  Alright  You know stuff like that  See a lot of times  We'll have  Actors will have early calls  We'll have to be there  Are you putting yourself  In the same category 
[03:08:00]  As a Stanley Tucci  A couple of men  Of similar ilk  Just talking about show business  I don't believe  It's similar ilk  I don't think you're  In the same ilk park  You're probably right  She's in the ilk park  We're a member of the ilk  How did you go from  Painting apartments  And stuff to acting  Well no  I mean I was trying to act  You know  And I'd have jobs  Intermittently  And then when I needed money  I would paint apartments  Oh okay  Because that was  That was something  That I did when I was a kid  To make money  Yeah yeah  So then you know  It was something  To fall back on 
[03:08:30]  And if you didn't want to  I mean I was trained  As a bartender too  When I was in college  What a great way  To just get some extra cash  Yeah  So if I needed it  I could bartend or whatever  But ultimately  I ended up painting apartments  I actually liked that  When did you  When did you realize  Like wow  I don't have to do that work anymore  I could act full time  I'm not quite there  You're not there  Look I do have a wall  That's peeling a bit  At the house  If you want to come by  And take a roller to it  I'll do it  I'll do it  I mean that's why  I have a cookbook  I know this  Yeah there you go  Diversify  Is this your first book 
[03:09:00]  Where is that  Yes  And as Rodney Dangerfield said  Now I'm going to read another one  Yeah  Well this book was done  Like 12 years ago  After I did Big Night  I put this together  With my folks  And my friend  Johnny Scoppino  Who's the northern Italian chef  And it came out  And people really loved it  Did really well  And then it was out of print  And then we looked  On the internet  And people literally were  Like selling this  For like  From hundreds  To thousands of dollars  Come on  Wow  I know  Wow

[03:10:30]  In huge trouble  No  Why would we be  Oh  Why would we  You don't know how this  Because that's how this place works  We gave a very very nice  Oh very respectful  That was a quick high  That was a quick high  Sam  I had nothing to do with it  I give Opie credit for making it  Yeah  I give Opie credit too  Because Opie  I made pirate face on him  You did the initial  Sam  I think he saw the enthusiasm  In this young guy's face  Can I say something though  You know I hope he gets credit  He looked at me  And I said come in  I waved him  How much trouble 
[03:11:00]  Here's what happened  Yes Jimmy  Everyone's just throwing their hands  Who's in trouble  Are you guys in trouble for this  I had nothing to do with it  Here's why  I'll tell you how we're supposed to  Get a guess  We're not allowed to grab other guests  That isn't booked on the show  What Roland  To just come and imprompt  What's the problem  The pirate face  What's the problem  Here's how we get Stanley Tucci  It was the problem  It wasn't Stanley Tucci  That would be a huge problem  He took a photo with me  And then when he liked me  And when he looked in  And saw that I was a part of this group  He figured this is a safe haven  Oh no  He heard everybody screaming 
[03:11:30]  They're having a good time  What's going on  I know  I said they're praising you  Did he like my pirate voice  So what's the issue  I don't know that there is an issue  Is there an issue  I haven't heard of an issue  There will be  Why would there be  I'm sure  Because there always is  There has to be an issue  I think Obi's quote  If yo Tucci is  Yo Tucci  Yo Tucci  Yo Tucci  Well  Gotta do what you gotta do  That was  He was the man  He was good  How cool is that fucking guy  That's exciting man 
[03:12:00]  What a nice fellow  He was such the man  I think we should go home  And celebrate  Yo Tucci  Yo Tucci  Whose phone is this  Jim's isn't it  Is that his phone  Is that Stanley's phone  Is this Stanley's phone  Just press the button  See the first button  Is that a picture  It's gone on  It's gone  Okay  That's fine  Where's the cake though  Come on  Turn his phone on  Let's see what he's got going on  Go give him his phone  And tell him we didn't even go through it  That's what an honorable show we are  Oh  Obi doesn't give him my phone by mistake  Whose phone is that  Why are all these ladies with penises popping up on 
[03:12:30]  You know Stanley  Tell me he didn't know the passcode  He's got our book  And the same publisher that put out his book  Put out ours  Yeah I know  Where do you think your book's going to end up  I think it's going to end up in the  Although his wife is in the publishing business  I say it's  His wife's a literary agent  I thought his wife was the lady from Sopranos  That's who he was dating for a while  Oh I'm so glad you didn't bring that up  When he was here  Did they break up  I would assume so  I say the book winds up with a limo driver 
[03:13:00]  What if it's laying around the house  And then this lady who's in that business reads it  It would be good for you  What happened  What happened Roland  Was that his phone  I went to the wrong studio  What happened  Now Kenny what are you saying  Kenny  On the mic  Who's man  Oh no I walked in there  I go  Dude Stanley  Oh the mail said  Yo Tucci  Yeah  Yo Tucci  Oh because they're in the middle of an interview  I think  Yeah  I'm going to buy his book  I think Tucci's a good shit  I think he's going to read the book  I really do 
[03:13:30]  What did he say  Yeah dude  Come on he's up for a fucking laugh  He's a regular guy  You know what I mean  Sure  Is somebody angry  Like there's going to be trouble  Kenny  Is there a problem  Yes  You're the harbinger of horrid news  Who's mad at us  What do you think is the problem  What show was he supposed to go on  He was  He had a few minutes there  What happened  I saw a producer from another show run down here  And I've never seen that before  So  What show  I'm just deducing that  What show  There might be an issue  Since he was scheduled for that show 
[03:14:00]  Well Iraq is there an issue  I'm aware of  No  Oh okay  Well  Ron and Fez  He's going on to Larry Flick right now  Ron and Fez  Why would we be in bed  Who was it  Who ran number all  Is he booked for Ron and Fez  Yes  Oh yes  Was that a producer from Ron and Fez  Yeah  Came running toward the studio  Yeah  Are you sure it wasn't for something else  Let's make sure  It might have been for something else  Yeah don't start hurling fucking  But no I called Kenny in  He texted me something  I wanted to make sure  That was you know  It was my question  Oh 
[03:14:30]  Wow  Is he angry with us  He's not in here  I haven't seen it  Where's Pepper  Where  Let's ask him  Oh it was Pepper  That came running down  I feel like  Uncomfortable  Where's the Pepper  Who is this Pepper guy  Do we know him  He's probably a big misunderstanding  Oh  Is he coming in  Hmm  Maybe Sam  Sandusky  Sandusky  Sandusky got what  He said he's  The quote was  I'm the real victim  Yeah yeah yeah  I'll take that to jail with you 
[03:15:00]  Enjoy that  I can't believe Tucci has our book  I can't believe that either  It was a good move Bob  No but here's the thing  At the end  He put it down  I was like he's just going to leave it  Let it go  We'll take it  You didn't want to be rude  And he goes  I'm taking this with me  He didn't want to be rude  Like Ozzy Osbourne was  I remember another time  There were books laying around  No  You never heard the Ozzy story  God was that embarrassing  It's probably the hardest  I've ever laughed in my life  You don't know that story  What is it  In a brief  I'm retweeting that video  I know it's a cheap plug 
[03:15:30]  But I'm retweeting this today  Sam  Can you find  Without giving away the punchline here  Can you find the quickly  Opie's Ozzy video  When it was Ozzy's birthday  I'll retweet this for sure  And I bought 18 pounds of books  You don't know this  I don't know dude  I forgot we weighed  I'm like Sherlock Holmes  It's 18 pounds of books  I don't keep all the information  In my head  It was Ozzy's birthday  He's a Beatles fan  So Jimmy went out  And got Beatles books  18 pounds  That weighed 18 pounds  Four giant Beatle books  That I got  We interviewed him  For like 45 minutes  Holy shit 
[03:16:00]  That's not it  That's not it  Sam  Sam  Sam  Sam  Sam  Sam's terrible at this  Sam  Isn't that his job  No tooch  He left it on  So he could get his plug out  Toochay  The Oopster's tricky  The Oopster knows what he's doing  He's tricky  This is the 18 pounds of birthday  How long is this video  It's 8 minutes  Century  No can we go towards the middle  It's 4 minutes  It's your birthday  And I know you've been getting it  That's probably  Most sweet  That's right  So he goes through the 
[03:16:30]  Hold on pause  I'll set this up nice for everybody  Because we don't have to play the whole video  I will retweet this shit though  I'll take advantage of that  So Jimmy gives him his birthday gifts  It's all those books  See him  He's a Beatles fanatic  It's 18 pounds of books  They made me weigh him  He weighs 18 pounds  Right  So now  You know  Ozzy was being nice  He seemed to like the books  He liked them  Yeah yeah yeah  Watch this  He did like them  I'm sorry  What are you doing Joe  Stop doing it  I didn't mean I'm sorry  Stop it  It was an accident  I didn't do it on purpose  He liked the books

[03:17:30]  We still have the books  They just brought it to our studio  Yes  As we watched the video  Oh my god  I don't think that was a hi-hat  I think he just forgot the fucking book  He did  Yeah but he forgot the books  It's the fact that Sal brought them in  He's half fucking Joe  Hold that  Now we're taking pictures  The show's I guess over  Wrap it up  And you can just see the books sitting there  Ozzy's officially out of the studio  Watch this  Bye Ozzy  Thank you  Watch this Bobby  They literally had to grab and pull Ozzy away from Jimmy  Look at me  Zoom in on the book 
[03:18:00]  Jesus you wrapped him up  Yes  Oh  It was his birthday  It was such  More importantly  Watch this  More importantly  This is great  One more thing  More importantly  Yeah  More importantly  Oh no  Oh no  Oh no  Oh no  Oh no  Oh no  Oh no  Oh no  Oh no  Oh no  Oh no  Oh no  Oh no  Oh no  Oh no  Perfect  There it is ladies and gentlemen  The pile of books  That's what he thinks of your stupid books  The pile of books are laying on the counter 
[03:18:30]  But at least Ozzy left his cup  Oh no  Look at Jimmy  Jimmy's laughing and crying at the same time  Oh  Oh  Oh  Oh  Oh  Oh  Oh  Oh  Oh  Oh  Oh  Oh  Oh  Oh  Oh  Oh  Oh  Oh  Oh  Oh  Oh  Oh  Oh  Oh  Oh  Oh  Oh  Oh  Oh  Oh  Oh  Oh  Oh  Oh  Oh  Oh  Oh  Oh  Oh  Oh  Oh  Oh  Oh  Oh  Oh  Oh  Oh  Oh wait  There's  That's more than

[03:19:30]  His second thought  To take vote  I have to be honest  It is exactly  As it should be  But he was very cool  We were talking after  About me doing sets at night  And they actually  Physically just dragged him out  Oh my god  He was like  Did you do comedy  Like I told him  I do comedy at night  And uh  Answer the books  No he didn't  This motherfucker  First of all  This is more than 18 pounds  You should have just got him 
[03:20:00]  A fucking boat anchor  Yeah yeah  This is stupid  The whole set up also  Was the fact that  We were talking about  These gifts for Ozzy  The entire show  Before Ozzy showed up  I think days in advance  Yeah it was like days  What to get Ozzy  Meticulously picking out  What to get Ozzy  Wrapping it  Like it was a big production  So when he left them there  It was huge  The fact that he wrapped them  And we still have the books  By the way  He never asked for them  That's even sadder  People never asked for them  Oh he had to unwrap them  Live on our show  Oh this is one of 
[03:20:30]  Oh and then one of the books  He goes  Oh yeah I have this one  The one of them he had  But the other ones  He didn't have  And he allegedly likes  And he still doesn't have them  And his cup by the way  That he had left there  They came back  And they were like  Oh Ozzy's people came back  They were like  Yeah he wanted this cup  He left his cup in here  Oh right  He wanted his cup back  Oh you never got the cup?  No they took it back  Because that's his lucky cup  Or whatever  The best part is  Just picturing Norton  By himself at a bookstore  Yeah yeah  Lugging that fucking  18 pounds of book  Back to Beatles books  Yes I did 
[03:21:00]  It was about 18 pounds  I wrote him a nice card  Yeah that's right  Did he take the card at least?  No he didn't  No  He literally didn't take anything  Yes he left them all  Yeah  He read the card though  He left  Who the fuck buys  So many five heavy books  Four  What is he  Fucking Einstein  I think he might be  Have time on the plane  To read  Who the fuck  He couldn't hold  One of those books  I think it's illegal  To carry that many books  On the plane  I think  Yeah yeah  There's a book limit  Yeah  But Ozzy likes the Beatles
