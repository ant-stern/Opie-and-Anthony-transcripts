<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show opened with a comedic montage of politicians awkwardly dancing with African tribesmen, particularly mocking Obama and Hillary Clinton's dance moves.  This transitioned into a discussion of a collapsed hotel in Taiwan, followed by a detailed and enthusiastic recounting of the hosts' experience at UFC 101, including their favorable impressions of the fighters' approachability (contrasting it with negative experiences with some Phillies baseball players, specifically Jason Wirth).  Studio guest Kenny joined in the UFC discussion, focusing on Anderson Silva's fight against Forrest Griffin, highlighting Silva's showboating and a subsequent caller's criticism of Silva's perceived disrespect. A fight in the stands at UFC 101 was also mentioned, along with Joe Rogan's comedy show.  A technical issue with a studio monitor briefly interrupted the broadcast.  Further UFC discussion included speculation about Silva moving to a higher weight class and a possible boxing match with Roy Jones Jr., comparing UFC and boxing fighting styles. This led to a discussion about a plane and helicopter collision over the Hudson River, focusing on the incident and E-Rock's underwhelming Twitter coverage.  Jimmy shared a story about accidentally submerging his iPhone in a jacuzzi. The segment concluded with movie reviews, harshly criticizing "G.I. Joe" but highly recommending "District 9," and a shocking anecdote about an encounter with Ken Jeong involving alleged indecent exposure.

The next segment heavily featured movie reviews and discussions, interspersed with numerous tangents. Caller Kent reviewed several films, praising a violent alien movie for its gore, calling *Inglourious Basterds* "fucking awesome" and violent, mentioning *Star Trek*, and giving a strong recommendation for *Moon* while withholding plot details. The hosts discussed the box office performance of *Julie & Julia* (negatively), *G.I. Joe* (deemed "cartoony"), and the perceived poor quality of summer blockbusters post-writers' strike.  Kent offered to send the hosts Blu-rays, including screeners of *Moon* and *Bronson*.  Other topics included Jason Giambi's declining baseball performance, Tiger Woods' golfing success, a nostalgic review of *Point Break*, criticism of edited versions of films on AMC (*Pulp Fiction* and *Fight Club*), a discussion of *Schindler's List*, complaints about cable TV's limited movie selection, a listener’s anecdote about a Henry Fonda film depicting spousal abuse, a listener’s recurring nightmares, speculation about Lady Gaga being intersex based on an online quote, a humorous anecdote about a man blaming his cat for downloading child pornography, further discussions of old films depicting violence against women, and an anecdote about a woman driving the wrong way on a bridge.  The Michael Jackson estate and controversies surrounding his children were also briefly touched upon.

The following segment started with a vulgar and highly offensive discussion about Michael Jackson's alleged interest in Mark Lester, referencing his appearance.  This transitioned into a discussion about Reverend Al Sharpton's involvement (and subsequent withdrawal) in the Michael Jackson situation. The conversation then shifted to an Australian quadriplegic man petitioning for the right to die, comparing it to "Whose Life Is It Anyway?" and segueing into a humorous tangent about "Lost." This prompted a debate on individual freedom versus societal rules, including same-sex marriage. A significant portion focused on the 40th anniversary of Woodstock, referencing a Dateline special, focusing on a priest who abandoned his studies after meeting a woman at Woodstock, her aging appearance, the musical lineup (including Jimi Hendrix, Janis Joplin, The Who, CCR, and others), logistical challenges, and the overall chaos. A caller deemed the upcoming Woodstock movie "douchey and queer." Several callers shared personal Woodstock anecdotes. The segment concluded with a discussion of Obama's healthcare plan, focusing on criticisms of its potential to eliminate private insurance, a White House response, government censorship, a potential "survival czar," and a heated debate with callers about the fairness of a single-payer system and the financial burden of healthcare. A roofing contractor caller shared his perspectives on the healthcare system.

A subsequent segment centered on the Obama administration's information gathering practices, debating whether it constituted censorship or a legitimate effort to counter misinformation. The discussion included comparisons to Nazi and communist regimes, criticisms of media bias favoring Obama, and concerns about potential abuse of power. Callers expressed strong opinions on both sides. One caller shared a Canadian healthcare system experience, while another in the healthcare industry raised concerns about mandatory health counseling for the elderly.  Anthony expressed strong disapproval of the Obama administration. The segment also featured discussions about Anthony's extremely hot pool (93 degrees), a caller's expensive medical stress test, and a humorous account of a man hiding a gun (or, later corrected, a plastic penis) in his body fat. It concluded with a discussion of a news reporter's overly enthusiastic and inaccurate tweets about a plane crash.  Mary and Barry were mentioned as having visited the studio earlier.

The final segment heavily featured E-Rock Radio's live tweets from a helicopter crash scene on the West Side Highway.  E-Rock's blurry, uninformative photos were heavily criticized, with jokes about his photographic skills.  The hosts and Danny attempted (unsuccessfully) to locate bodies in the pictures. E-Rock's tweets mentioned the arrival of the Hoboken mayor (or acting mayor), the governor, and emergency personnel. Later tweets described the recovery of helicopter parts and bodies, accompanied by equally poor photos.  Tangents included E-Rock's spelling and grammar, and a revisiting of a past "What the F" bit. The show ended with the hosts riffing on E-Rock's inept reporting and their own exhaustion, along with Danny.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  But enough of this palaver! Let's get the show on the road!  Monday.  I don't know.  What are you guys looking at?  I don't know, there's a montage of dignitaries dancing with traditional African tribesmen.  And then Obama.  And I got Obama dancing with Ellen.  Stupid Ellen. 
[00:00:30]  Proven that he's a complete nerd.  Look at him.  And then they had Hillary dancing with some traditional African tribesmen.  I don't know why they feel compelled to do that.  Because they look silly.  They got to do the whole weird African dance and they just look retarded doing it.  Hillary should have done the booty dance.  Get that booty out and start shaking it.  She was like getting down and bending her knees and shaking her ass.  It's like trying to get one of those tribesmen to do like the chicken dance and make him look all silly. 
[00:01:00]  The one thing with Obama watching him dance with Ellen proves just because you're black doesn't mean you're cool.  Obama is such a nerd.  He's not a cool guy.  The more footage you see of him just doing everyday things, you realize he's just a nerd.  Yeah.  Like he just wears the wrong jeans.  He can't really throw a baseball properly.  Can't dance we just saw.  No.  And that's like, you know, a biggie.  Should be able to shake a leg. 
[00:01:30]  That hotel video is just amazing.  Six stories.  The one that fell into the water there in Taiwan or somewhere.  Where was it?  It was Taiwan.  Oh, that's why.  Yeah, yeah.  I thought it was because of a typhoon.  It was.  Come on.  Yeah.  The water, the river right next to it kind of ate away at the foundation and it fell over sideways.  Yeah.  I would assume they got the people out knowing that it probably could fall.  But it's Taiwan, so who the fuck knows. 
[00:02:00]  I was telling you, though, imagine if you had a late checkout.  Yeah, you're just sleeping like, ah, get a late checkout.  This hangover really sucks.  It feels like the whole room is spinning.  It's like the room is tipping over.  Right.  Yep.  Whoa.  Well, we're going to do a couple minutes on this UFC 101.  Norton was asking me about it.  101.  Goddamn, Dana White, you rule.  This guy knows how to take care of people.  This guy knows how to run a company.  Just an amazing guy.  At one point, he's grabbing stuff from the fans to get things signed for people. 
[00:02:30]  Really?  He does that?  This girl goes, do you mind?  Could you give these?  I think she had like UFC type gloves.  Could you give these to Chuck Liddell?  I want his autograph.  And Dana White goes, sure, no problem.  And grabs them.  And I wanted to strangle the woman.  She was sitting pretty much next to me.  I didn't know who she was.  I'm like, he's the owner of the company.  Leave him alone.  He's a little busy right now making sure, you know, this show's going well.  But he took those gloves.  He could have just said, look, I'm busy.  He grabbed them.  Got them to Chuck Liddell. 
[00:03:00]  Chuck signed them.  And then he walks him back to the woman.  Dude, none of those guys, not one guy has been a dick in the UFC.  Not one guy has been a dick.  And for Jimmy to say that.  Dude, they're all fan friendly.  They sign stuff.  They'll take pictures.  No matter who they are, they're fucking great.  Chuck should have signed the gloves, put them on, and punched through the face of them.  Tattooed his autograph.  Who's Liddell Chuck to crush your face?  In between the fights, though, they all just worked the crowd.  Yeah.  They worked the crowd, you know, near the cage.  And wow.  That was my first UFC fight live. 
[00:03:30]  And I tweeted that I'm so in now.  Yeah.  I was sort of in.  I was sort of like taking a peek from the outside.  And I would listen to, you know, especially Jimmy and Bob Kelly and Patrice when they're  talking about this because you guys seem to really know the UFC.  I'm all in now.  You go to one event.  Well, then again, if you had seats like me, how can you not?  How can you not be in?  Right.  You fucking sneeze.  You get on the fighter's back.  I had blood on my forehead from half the fights.  I was so close.  I am so in, though.  I'm so hooked. 
[00:04:00]  All I want to do is talk about the UFC.  Did you talk to Chuck?  He said hi.  He actually recognized me from being on the show.  Tito barely recognized me.  Really?  Yeah, barely.  My brother got pictures with Chuck.  Yeah, I was sitting right next to your brother, man.  He had a great time.  He had a great time.  Those guys, a lot of times when they're in, I know when they're in that fight arena place,  like that whole, in that element, I've been on the road where I've done radio show, and  then you meet the guy, and you know you know him from somewhere, and then when you go, 
[00:04:30]  I'm so-and-so, and then you go, oh, I'm like, okay, but a lot of times in a different  element, you don't recognize somebody.  By the way, it's fine that Chuck Liddell, you know, he goes, oh, at the last second, it's  fine, whatever.  I mean, he's done our show, and he's done a million other shows.  Dana White, though, at one point came over just to say hi to me, and then, because everybody  wants his autograph, like they were crushing me from behind to try to get to Dana, and  me and Dana are just having a little chit-chat.  He's like, how are you doing?  What do you think?  I'm like, what do I think?  This is amazing.  Dana's big man on campus. 
[00:05:00]  And then he's like, well, I hope the last few fights are good, because I'm not too happy  with the pay-per-view so far.  And the last two fights, I think, made the whole damn pay-per-view.  Yeah, he wants it to be like, he doesn't care about the payday.  No, he wants the fights to be really fucking good fights.  That Forrest Griffin fight, man, was, even though it was short, but I was saying before  the fight, that guy who sat in here, he's a tough motherfucker.  Oh, yeah.  And he got the shit beat out of him.  There's so many bad dudes in the UFC. 
[00:05:30]  And when the fight started, you knew right off the bat, and I don't, like I said, I don't  know, I'm not going to claim I have all this knowledge about the UFC, but to me, I was  like, wow, Forrest Griffin is in the wrong place.  This Silva looked like he, you know, was the way better man right from the beginning.  And then people were saying, oh, Forrest Griffin obviously threw the fight, blah, blah, blah.  Threw the fight.  Now, for what?  Threw the fight.  He was outmatched.  Against a guy who was probably favored?  Yeah, yeah.  Like, no one is surprised that Silva won.  I mean, uh... 
[00:06:00]  And it was, no surprise, because it was Philly.  Every time it was a black versus a white, everyone cheering for the white guy, everybody was  on Forrest Griffin's side, and then by the end of the fight, Silva turned them all around  where the entire place was cheering Silva, which I thought was really, really cool.  Like Rocky turned Russia around.  Right.  But Silva was bobbing and weaving.  He was kind of doing a Muhammad Ali, because he just knew that he was the better man in that  cage.  He had it.  And then he freaking knocks out Forrest Griffin with a jab, moving away from him, it looked 
[00:06:30]  like.  Yeah, yeah.  But I think it was like a little short punch.  I actually had to rewind and watch it.  But when you do rewind and watch it, you realize that that was a hell of a hit.  Forrest's big block head just gets punched.  And Forrest was still moving forward after he was kind of knocked out, because he was  making a move.  And how he fell was pretty amazing to watch.  Let's say hi to Rob in Jersey.  Rob, what's going on?  Hey, fellas.  Hey, buddy.  I feel as though Anderson Silva kind of disrespected Forrest Griffin, to be honest with you. 
[00:07:00]  Do you mean in the ring, the way he was kind of bobbing around?  Well, the way he dropped his hands halfway through the first round, and then he tried  to help him up at one point, just showing that he kind of owned him.  He was good as a fighter as Forrest did, and Anderson took him apart, but I felt he did  it in kind of an unclassy way.  Can I be honest?  I saw that when he tried to help him up.  I know what you mean about dropping the hands, but there was one point where he knocked  Griffin down, and Griffin put his hands up.  It almost looked like Griffin, I don't think he was trying to disrespect him when he did 
[00:07:30]  that.  I think Griffin was just getting up, and it looked like Griffin was reaching his hand  up, like, help me up, even though he wasn't.  Right.  I think that was just a courtesy.  I don't think the guy was trying to embarrass him by helping him up, but I think that was  just two guys who don't dislike each other.  I kind of like some of that showboating.  I really do.  When Silva was bobbing, waving, doing a little Muhammad Ali action, I personally like that  type of thing.  I know the UFC tries to, like, you know, make sure that there's not too much of that  going on, but it just gets you pumped when you're watching the fight.  The hot dogging.  Oh, yeah.  It also makes the other guy really want to beat the shit out of you. 
[00:08:00]  Like, I can actually see that as being kind of strategic in the ring, where if you're  beating a guy and then you start taunting him, it makes him even angrier, and he's just  not as effective.  Yeah, and you want to talk about disrespect, and then Griffin ran out of the ring.  As soon as he woke up from his little knockout.  From his nap.  He popped up and just ran out of the arena.  And the Philadelphia paper yesterday morning said that Griffin ran because he dislocated his  jaw.  I don't know what's true, because now some people are saying that's not true.  But supposedly he...  I bet they had trouble, but they said it was medical.  Yeah, supposedly he ran out of the ring because... 
[00:08:30]  He had a medical situation after getting knocked out.  I was like, I need to see a doctor immediately.  My jaw does not feel right.  He's lost before.  I mean, you know what I mean?  It's like he got knocked out by a good fighter.  It's like it happens.  You know, these guys are all fucking...  Are all capable of knocking each other out.  Yeah.  So I don't see him running away just because he lost.  The one thing about sitting so close to a UFC fight that I just got to say is the...  When you hear skin-on-skin hits, you just don't realize the sound that makes.  And you're like, wow.  And then, I mean, a guy will take a kick to the back, you know, to the shoulder blades 
[00:09:00]  or whatever, and then we'll be beat red immediately.  Immediately.  And then he's still just in there fighting.  And Kenny kept leaning over to me going, that really hurt.  That hurts.  That hurts.  That one hurt.  When the guy's getting a real hard kick to the shin, he goes, that really hurts.  So who was the crowd?  Were they rooting for BJ or for Kenny Florian?  Uh, that's, that's a, wow, I got it to remember back now.  What, Kenny?  It was mixed.  It was mixed, right? 
[00:09:30]  That's about what I was going to say.  Because Florian's, I think he's from Boston.  His whole family is like all martial artists.  Well, Florian was basically saying what?  BJ Penn's the master and I have to kill the master.  And he also said that, you know, he's going to take out BJ in the first round.  And then they show BJ in the highlights going, did he really say that?  All pissed off?  I'm so in, bro.  Yeah, it's great.  Where are we flying to next?  Screw the radio show.  We're going to be fanboys of the UFC.  Dude, I am like a fuck.  Did you meet Reed? 
[00:10:00]  No.  There's a guy named Reed Harris who's a buddy of mine.  Robert?  Yeah, no, right.  I said, do you live like it?  And he just takes you, introduces you to everyone.  I don't even know if he was at this one.  I imagine he was.  He's always with Chuck.  I don't know.  Okay.  Yeah, I didn't meet him.  He's Chuck's manager.  Kenny, what do you think?  You like?  You and Douglas like?  Yes.  Yes.  But, you know, I do that sort of thing, so it's a way of life for me.  Yeah, hopefully what Forrest Griffin did. 
[00:10:30]  Get knocked out and run.  What was your favorite fight, Kenny?  I enjoyed every fight equally.  How much do you weigh?  Jesus Christ.  Are you kidding me?  You were pretty much in the front row.  Dana White is expecting you to give a little something on the radio on Monday.  What do you think of the freaking experience?  I sent my thank you email about how, you know, classy and professional an operation the UFC is.  You can't not notice that. 
[00:11:00]  And it's like, it's so well run.  And it's like, it's fan friendly, which is another thing that so many of these other stupid athletes don't understand.  It's like, if you treat fans good, they're never going to forget it.  They're going to be loyal.  And I'm also this close to feeling like you do to, as far as baseball players go.  Everybody, and I mean everybody, was working the crowd and taking pictures and autographs except for one fucking guy.  Except for a few guys.  The Phillies came in after, I think, they lost. 
[00:11:30]  So they came in for the pay-per-view.  And most of the guys, you know, weren't taking pictures or signing autographs.  But most people, they were staying away.  But this Jason, I think his name is Jason Wirth of the Phillies, is the biggest douchebag.  I don't even know who he is.  Blew us off three times for a picture.  Three times.  How do you get three times?  Because he was right there.  And he wasn't taking pictures with anybody.  He's like, nah, nah, nah, nah, nah, nah.  That's like three strikes.  He's out.  He just came across as a real big dick. 
[00:12:00]  I can't stand most of those motherfuckers, man.  And I mean, by that, I mean, most baseball players can't stand them.  Because UFC guys couldn't, they're like, yeah, sure.  Sure, whatever you want.  Like, they were almost missing fights because they were taking so many pictures.  And he's like, nah, nah, nah, nah.  Three times.  Would you ask three times?  Well, it was a group of us.  So it wasn't, it didn't even look like it was the same guy.  It was just three people in my group separately asking.  Because at one point he goes, no, no, not now.  So someone goes, well, you ready to take pictures? 
[00:12:30]  Like, trying to cater to him.  Are you ready?  Yeah, just another fucking, another douchey athlete.  What a shock.  Yeah.  I can't stand them.  Can't stand baseball players.  Yeah, I don't know what's going on with baseball players.  They just think they're way above everybody else as far as in that athletic world goes.  I know.  And here's these guys who are just really just fucking beating the shit out of each other.  And they couldn't be nicer.  You couldn't be.  They could not be more pleasant.  Even the ones that don't speak English, at least nod politely when you're praising them.  Yeah.  Tito was working the crowd.  It was just, and then there was a fight in the stands. 
[00:13:00]  I felt, I don't even remember who was, who was fighting in the, in the cage when this happened.  Cause it was, it was about a 10 minute fight and the entire crowd just looked sideways.  From our vantage point, we really couldn't see what was going on.  Finally, on, uh, on YouTube, someone's got a video up and it was, it's amazing.  This one girl, I don't know who started the fight, but this one girl's motherfucking like crazy from a distance.  And then, and I'm like, oh, that's real brave.  And then all of a sudden she just charges forward and throws a right. 
[00:13:30]  If we can find that video, it's on YouTube.  It's everywhere today.  Just throws a right.  And the place goes nuts.  Why would they fight?  They just, she was arguing with another chick?  I don't know.  I don't, I don't, it was too far away.  I didn't really see it.  I just saw everyone's head.  Just everyone was just standing up and turning to the right.  That's just Philly.  I mean, they had that happen.  For 10 straight minutes.  They had that happen.  If the Pope does an appearance with more than 500 people, fucking two chicks are going to fight.  Two chicks going at it.  Hey, did you see Rogan?  Of course.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  I went to the Helium Club on Friday for his set. 
[00:14:00]  He decided to do like two and a half hours.  Oh, did he really?  He was just, he was just.  He's hysterical, man.  He was just feeling it and just, I'm like, holy shit, it's 1.30.  And because it's Friday night, you know, we've been up since what?  4.30.  So I was pushing 24 hours.  I was, I was, I was tired.  But he put on a great set at the Helium Comedy Club.  I want to thank them for taking care of us as well.  So it was a nice Philly weekend.  Yeah.  I wish I would have, I couldn't go because I'm preparing, I'm timing out this stuff for  Leno's show.  And it's, it's on a time, I'm on a schedule where it has to be. 
[00:14:30]  Oh.  I just want it to be timed out by a certain time.  And I'm trying to take like nine minutes of shit and put it down into five minutes.  And that's a pain in the ass, right?  Yeah.  It's just an issue of, I'm, I'm very, very pressured.  When do you do the first one?  I don't know, but I know I have to go out at the end of August just to do certain, um,  we would do, do test shows, which, you know, every show does that in front of an audience  just to see how everything times out and how the lighting is.  It's like all these little weird things because they haven't done any shows yet.  Yeah.  So it's just a matter of, I want to be completely prepared when I go.  I don't want to be fucking, oh, I think this is going to work, you know. 
[00:15:00]  Yeah, yeah.  It has to work in front of an audience.  Jimmy's smart.  Let's say hi to Sean in Illinois.  Sean.  Hey, what's up?  Do we have that chick fight on YouTube?  This monitor's out today.  Oh, it's out today?  Oh, that's going to be a problem.  What the fuck?  What happened, Dan?  That's my monitor.  I won't be ignored.  That's everybody's monitor except yours.  The piece of hardware that mimics what's on my screen to that screen is done.  Why wouldn't it be?  Of course it is.  It's got to just break over the weekend.  Yeah, of course.  Yeah, why did it break over the weekend?  That's how it is.  But Kenny, you didn't answer me.  How much do you weigh?  You did a good Mars impression there. 
[00:15:30]  I go between 245 and 250.  You're fucking, you're like heavier than Griffin and Scylla?  My fighting weight back in the day was 235.  Okay, so Kenny is a big dude.  I didn't know you were that big.  Griffin weighs, I got some stuff right in front of me.  Is it 205?  205, right?  Yep.  Kenny is a guy you did not want showing up on the call where you were the perp.  Hell no.  Where you're the bad guy.  You didn't want to see the car pull up and see Kenny get out of it. 
[00:16:00]  Oh, this is good to know.  Jack in Florida.  Hey, oh, karma's a bitch.  Jason Wirth was put in the game as a defensive replacement yesterday and promptly made two errors in one inning.  Then got booed by the Philly fans.  Nice.  Ah-ha.  Nice.  Probably was having too much fun at the UFC 101.  He was a dick, dude.  Simple as that.  So many of them are, dude.  Simple as that.  So many of them are.  A fucking douchebag.  What's up, Sean?  What's going on, guys?  Hey, buddy.  Did you have a great time there or what?  It was amazing, bro. 
[00:16:30]  I'm so in, I can't even tell you.  I was sort of in, but now he's got me.  I'm hooked.  I'll bet.  I went to UFC 90 in Chicago.  It was a blast.  It was all Anderson Silva.  It wasn't a very good fight, but still, the whole atmosphere was awesome.  But, hey, I was reading on the UFC website.  I've been a fan for years.  I'm on, like, all the forums and everything.  But I guess Anderson Silva now is relinquishing his middleweight title, and he's going to make the move up to 205 permanent.  But I don't know if you know this, but the UFC has a clause in their contract called Champion's Clause, 
[00:17:00]  where if you're a champion, you can't leave the organization without either losing a fight or retiring.  And Roy Jones Jr., Anderson Silva signed a contract to box Roy Jones Jr.,  and I'm thinking he wants to get out of his – he doesn't want to hold the bell  because he's only got, like, three fights left on his UFC contract,  and he's going to have a straight boxing match with Roy Jones. 
[00:17:30]  So he's making that move up to 205, and I think he's going to finish out his UFC career.  His last few fights, fighting some pretty big-name light heavies, probably, like, Rampage or Shogun  and a couple guys like that.  So it should be interesting.  I was reading in the paper yesterday, too, that Roy Jones Jr. actually showed up –  I was going to say ringside, cage side – and confronted Dana White.  I didn't see that because he really wants to box Silva,  and he wants Dana White to make it happen.  Right. 
[00:18:00]  He even agreed that he would do it in the UFC under UFC rules, and Dana, you know, wouldn't allow.  Roy Jones even said, I'll allow elbows and kicks.  If Roy Jones allowed elbows and kicks, he would get the shit beat out of them.  I think so, too, right?  He's fucking crazy.  Yeah, that is crazy.  He'd get smoked in the UFC.  Because he would just be focusing on the head and, like, where he's going to try to hit him.  The next thing you know, he's going to get a kick to the shin.  Dude, when you watch –  To the shin.  Foot comes up on –  Yeah.  When you watch boxers – like, I was watching the Tyson, and you watch Tyson fight in, like, 1990. 
[00:18:30]  I don't care who the guy in the UFC is.  Anybody in the UFC who tried to stand up with Tyson would get their fucking head blown off.  You know what is standing up – just standing up with Mike Tyson.  Right.  You can't do it.  But the problem is all they do is they kick you once in the leg.  You go, ow, and they fucking tackle you.  Ow.  You don't stand there with a guy like that.  Like, Roy Jones is fucking crazy.  I think Dana White's trying to save him a beating.  I really do.  I think Roy Jones would – I mean, he'll be the favorite in a boxing match. 
[00:19:00]  Sure.  But in the UFC, he would get smoked.  Yeah.  Okay.  That's what we're saying.  I think these other athletes –  Thank you, Sean.  On a certain way, like the boxers and stuff, I think that it drives them nuts that they know that UFC is being perceived is so much tougher.  Like, because boxers are tough fucking dudes, but they just don't have – they don't kick.  Yeah.  And they can't use their – you know, we know that they can't do.  And that's got to drive them nuts that they build this reputation of being the toughest fuckers on the planet.  And then these savages come along and are just doing everything they do and plus doing it on the ground. 
[00:19:30]  Yeah.  By the way, BJ Penn won.  A couple people asking who won that fight.  Oh, BJ Penn, yeah.  I thought you would know by now.  Yes, Kenny.  There's no comparison between, like, standing up boxing and grappling on the ground.  It's just grappling on the ground.  They wouldn't grapple.  Well, I'm just saying, no.  It would be a boxing match with elbows and kicks, so they would keep them standing up the whole time.  Yeah, but as far as UFC goes, when you go on the ground, it's 100 times harder.  Just those little, like, moves that get done on the ground, they have to punch within a three-inch area, and they figure it out. 
[00:20:00]  And the gloves are just scraping their face.  Yeah, they're just scraping the shit out of each other.  I would just be like, oh, stop it.  That would hurt.  And when you, like, a boxer, like, all they do is you better land the first punch because they're going to grab you.  Yeah.  And when there's a guy grabbing you around the waist and putting you against a cage, none of your boxing skills are going to help you when you're on the fucking floor face first.  Everything hurts with UFC.  Everything hurts.  Yeah.  There's not one move that doesn't cause pain. 
[00:20:30]  Just the kicks that would turn the skin immediately red to the point it looks like it's just going to be seeping blood any second was just amazing to watch.  In boxing, when they're clenching, the ref just steps in and tries to get him apart.  Here, UFC, when they're clenching, another guy's bringing his knee up into your side.  Yeah, yeah.  And you're just like, ow, even clenching hurts.  Stop.  No one move Kenny really loved was the foot stomp.  There was one foot stomp.  Yeah, that guy from Allentown.  Because they're all barefoot, obviously.  Yeah.  Allentown PA guy decided to do the foot stomp. 
[00:21:00]  Yeah, some hillbilly.  And Kenny goes, that really hurts.  Yeah, that was my highlight of the night.  It was, right?  I don't know.  I love the foot stomp.  Yeah, yeah.  The foot stomp.  Dude, he stomped this guy's foot.  You're like, that can't be good.  That can't be good.  I forget who it was at UFC 100.  I wish I could remember his name.  He came out.  He's out with a beard.  And he came out to a Cretan song.  And I'm like, this guy's going to be a problem.  Anyone that fucking comes out to a Cretan song is just a backwards fuck who's going to be a problem with fisticuffs. 
[00:21:30]  Yeah.  I wish I could remember who it was.  The entrance music for everybody was great, except somebody came out to beat it.  I'm like, Jesus Christ.  Oh, Michael Jackson's beat it.  I hope they won big.  I don't remember if he won or not.  I don't remember which fight that was now.  There were so many fights.  You know, the fights they showed before the pay-per-view were amazing.  First fight of the night, I don't know.  It was two young guys.  It was probably the best fight of the whole thing, and it wasn't on pay-per-view.  Three rounds of just complete action.  The undercards are fucking great.  It's really a weird thing.  Like, my first real fights were UFC. 
[00:22:00]  I'd never been to a boxing match.  And when you watch guys come out to that music with an entourage, it really is a fucking amazing.  Yeah.  You see Forrest Griffin's face after that?  Like, how fast a face can be ruined by fists?  Yeah.  He was just...  Oof.  Yeah.  He got popped.  And I got killed on Twitter over the weekend because I tweeted that I'm out of my mind because  they were showing UFC highlights from over the years and playing Bob O'Reilly by The Who.  I know it's Bob O'Reilly, but I wrote Teenage Wasteland because I know there's a lot of people 
[00:22:30]  out there that don't know Teenage Wasteland.  You know, Teenage is Bob O'Reilly.  Yeah.  So, like, idiot, you should know that's actually Bob O'Reilly.  I'm like, I know, but I'm trying to bring more people into my tweet, you assholes.  Give me a break.  People pick everything apart.  Yeah, give me a break.  Because people do call it that, Teenage Wasteland.  And I wasn't, I wasn't, I didn't tweet the actual title of the song.  I put Teenage Wasteland in capitals with an exclamation point. 
[00:23:00]  Like, this whole place is singing that part of the song watching UFC highlights.  Yeah.  And it got everyone's adrenaline flowing.  It was, all right, I'll stop talking about it.  You should go to the Fan Expo.  They didn't have it in Philly, I don't think, because it's just...  They had something going on in the afternoon.  We just got there late.  Oh, okay.  Yeah, yeah.  And by the way, Scott in Jersey, boxing where you use your feet is called kickboxing.  Oh, yeah, duh.  That's right, good point.  Yeah, but can you throw elbows in kickboxing?  Elbows.  I don't know.  I don't know either.  But I didn't even think of kickboxing.  He's right.  Let me say hi to Frank. 
[00:23:30]  Frank.  Hey, what's up?  Hey, buddy.  Hey.  And you've seen the Kurt Pellegrino fight and Josh Nier, the first fight on the pay-per-view.  Yeah.  Kurt was on top of him.  Oh, man.  That's a good call, too.  He said you hit like a bitch.  He said you hit like a bitch and then Kurt open-hand smacked him in the mouth and said,  you just got hit by a bitch.  I saw that in a post-fight interview.  Oh, nice.  Yeah, very good.  I mean, these guys are punching each other in the face talking shit. 
[00:24:00]  They're unbelievable.  It's an unbelievable sport.  We got invited to the press conference, but it was like one in the morning and we were  waiting around for 45 minutes and it still didn't happen.  But I wish Kenny was here.  I got to get this picture from my brother-in-law.  There were two steroid dudes in this press conference.  I don't know.  They're not associated with UFC.  I think they do a blog or something.  First of all, I think they were gay.  They were steroided out and they had these bubble butts that were making me, the Philly 
[00:24:30]  crew, Kenny and his son, laugh our fucking asses off and we got a picture of it.  I got a tweet later.  Doing a lot of glute work, do they?  Dude, the whole place, the whole fucking press room was laughing at these two guys.  Yeah, they had tight jeans and their butt actually went out like black girls, like  way the fuck out.  Wow.  Just getting laughed wherever they walked.  Sexy.  Oh my God.  The one guy had, he had a muscle shirt on, he was just popping out and then he had like  ridiculously hairy shoulders and arms and then these just gnarly steroid pimples all 
[00:25:00]  over him.  All over the roids.  Gotta love the roids.  I'll get the picture later.  I'll send it up on my Twitter, but whatever.  Is Mars fixing our monitor?  Yeah, it looks like it's up.  Yeah, I guess.  Ooh.  So at least he could do it.  He broke it.  And then other news over the weekend was this Hudson River.  See, this is why everyone got excited about Sully and now, see, this was supposed to happen  with the Sully thing.  We were supposed to have death and destruction. 
[00:25:30]  That's just going to be slowly people dying in the Hudson.  Well, now we forget about the cool miracle on the Hudson and now we get the nine dead.  We get the nine dead, the plane and the helicopter colliding over the Hudson River.  What day was that?  Saturday?  Sunday?  Saturday, I guess, right?  I don't know.  I didn't catch all of EROC's 8,000 Twitters about it.  Like he was the reporter on the scene.  He became a reporter on the scene and then he disappointed.  Was he there?  Yeah, but then he disappointed everybody.  Why?  Because that's what he does? 
[00:26:00]  Because his tweets sucked.  Yeah.  He tweets at one point, this is a picture of dead bodies.  This is the best I could do.  So I'm like, fuck, I'll click on dead bodies, right?  I click on it and it's two boats in the middle of the Hudson and they're pulling something  up.  You have no idea what they're pulling up.  It could be anything from a, like a, like a, like what?  Like a, like a piece of wreckage.  Yeah.  It could be wreckage.  I'm like, you don't, you don't title your picture pulling up dead bodies when you can't  see any type of dead bodies in the picture. 
[00:26:30]  Mr. Anticlimactic.  Absolutely.  You know what's scary is I saw the, uh, the photos, obviously, uh, there's no video of that.  It's just photos.  I don't know.  A video will surface still picks, but whoever took the still picks, the second after it  happened, it started snapping.  When you, the amazing thing about that is like, you see the piece of the plane.  Oh yeah.  Uh, the wind came off and the helicopter, they, they were intact.  So those people were alive when they fell.  Yeah.  The plane, uh, looked like it lost its wing, but had no other damage, but you know, that's 
[00:27:00]  pretty much.  That could be a problem.  That's the damage, uh, you don't want to have.  Yeah.  So just, uh, it's going to be the plane's fault.  And I think so.  Yeah.  You think?  Absolutely.  Yeah.  Now, now, um, absolutely.  If you look.  Because those helicopters don't go that high.  Let me tell you something though.  You're right.  You're right.  Uh, and it was very close to the heliport.  But, but I've seen those fucking helicopters take off like goddamn, they're dusting off  in, in the NOM.  Right.  They take off, the nose goes way down and they just come off that heliport and then, 
[00:27:30]  and then take altitude.  Um, it's Liberty tours though.  They've been doing the same pattern for years.  I don't know.  You know what I mean?  It's just one of those things though.  They do take off.  It looks reckless when the helicopter takes off.  Right.  They don't take off straight up, look around and then kind of go.  You know, they just, it's like a skid fucking take off.  Right.  And I was this close to tragedy, my friends.  Cause this is the, this is the, the, the helicopter tour that Jimmy got all panicky about.  You are right there. 
[00:28:00]  Remember I did one of these for my birthday and you're like, what are you doing?  What are you doing?  That's the, that's his Twitter.  This is E-Rock's Twitter.  It says Hudson River believed to be more plane pieces.  It looks like paper in the water.  It looks like styrofoam or.  It was probably in his backyard pool.  He decided to like, you know, throw stuff in the water.  And then they'll take a closeup of it.  Nothing that shows scale there or anything.  No, nothing.  It's the worst picture ever.  E-Rock is horrid when it comes to these things.  But that, uh, yeah, Jimmy, that's the Liberty Tours that you were like, what are you doing? 
[00:28:30]  Another body, best I could do.  There it is.  There's a picture.  It looks like a, a, a, a boat outing.  Right.  It just looks like an outing.  He writes, yeah, another body, best I could do.  And it's a, it's a rescue boat, a couple rafts, like it looks like, right?  There's nothing there that indicates there's a body in the water.  You could show those, that picture to a hundred people and a hundred people would go, well,  I guess it's people on a boat.  They wouldn't know what they're doing. 
[00:29:00]  Right.  And he puts another body.  How high up were they when they actually collided?  Does anybody know?  I was just going to, I was just going to throw a number out because I got a mic in front of me.  I decided maybe I shouldn't do that.  Yeah.  I don't know though.  I would guess a couple hundred feet.  The only way I could see it was the helicopter's fault is that the plane was coming and the  helicopter, like, answer just kind of took off into it.  Yeah, just took off and smashed into it.  How, uh, into the, uh, helicopter flight were they when the plane crashed? 
[00:29:30]  Not very.  If you, if you look.  Oh, then it's so the plane's fault.  So the plane's fault.  Yeah?  Yeah.  I'm going to, I'm, you want money on this?  Plane's fault.  I don't know.  It's all about like opening your eyes and, uh, in that situation.  Well, they were explaining that the helicopter could have been turning this way.  So now he can't see out of his right.  The, the, the plane was turning this way so he can't see out of his left.  And then it was just right into each other.  Both, you know, it's one of these things.  It's not, uh, that airspace is pretty much just kind of look, use your eyes, watch for 
[00:30:00]  traffic that way, make sure you don't hit anything.  I got it.  There's so many planes and helicopters over the Hudson that it's just bound to happen.  I got, I got a view of the Hudson river.  Not, I mean this, the, the plane and helicopter thing was further down the river than me, but  I was telling you before the, before the, uh, show went, helicopters fly by my window  every day.  Cause the corporate douches are flying home in their helicopters.  It's like, it's amazing one after another, like every, let's call it every five minutes  you see one flying by and then the river itself, you've got the small planes using the right 
[00:30:30]  side of the river, uh, to go one way.  It's hard to explain, I guess.  Well, if you're going up the river, uh, North, you, you stay to the right.  Yeah.  If you're coming down the river, going South, you stay to the right, going the other way.  You know what I mean?  Going South.  Yeah.  So it's like a highway and they're really close to each other.  And then way above, you see the, uh, the jets flying from all the different airports.  Yeah.  It's, it's amazing how busy that river is and that dumb Chuck Schumer now wants, uh, you 
[00:31:00]  know, an investigation into the blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.  Now he does.  Anytime anything happens, Schumer gets his nose in there.  If you, if you know anything about New York city and the Hudson river, you knew way ahead  of this crash that it was, it's, it's a busy place.  Yeah.  So why now Chuck Schumer that you want to take this, this on?  Cause you want your face in the news today?  Is that it?  Especially on such a hot day.  Uh, let me say hi to John in Jersey. 
[00:31:30]  John.  Hey, how you doing?  Hey, 500 feet.  The news is saying, Jimmy, thank you to, uh, this, whoever sent that in.  Uh, go ahead, John.  All right.  Uh, there's a right of way rule for flying and the vehicles with more maneuverability  have less right of way than the others.  So the plane would have had the right of way over a helicopter.  Yeah.  Yeah.  But the guy, the one pilot is saying, I'm reading this article in the post of the daily  news.  He's saying, uh, that he was, he saw the plane bearing down, really barreling down on the 
[00:32:00]  helicopter.  He tried to warn the helicopter pilot.  Um, Oh, right, right.  From the, uh, from the, uh, uh, teleport.  Yeah.  Yeah.  That guy, yeah.  His friend.  And he's like, Oh, trying to warn him.  No, really?  Terrible.  Hmm.  Maybe the helicopter was a, I don't know.  And they're not blaming anyone for the crash yet.  Well, they got to blame someone eventually.  You can't just, uh, right.  Well, they'll figure out, yeah, what happened and say somebody fucked up.  I think they both kind of fucked up.  Yeah.  I think they both, you know, but they're saying that the airspace has to be monitored and all 
[00:32:30]  and it's almost like there's very few accidents.  Bloomberg already said that ain't happening.  There's very few.  It's unfortunate.  It's very few.  And we all know that, you know, that's a very busy area and we need, need that to kind  of be a very busy area with, with everything that goes on there.  There's nothing you can do about it.  Cause it's almost like we traffic accidents happen occasionally.  I'm not, you know, it sucks, but it's going to happen.  Yeah.  You get enough traffic in one area that people are going to bang into each other every so  often.  Nine people dead though.  Wow.  That was supposed to happen with the Sully thing. 
[00:33:00]  If nine people died on that Sully plane, it wouldn't have been.  It would have been a major success still.  Yes.  They would have said only nine people.  Oh my God, this is amazing.  It's a miracle on the Hudson.  They would have still used miracle on the Hudson.  But now, uh, you know, everybody see that helicopter when they brought it out.  Yeah.  It didn't even look like a helicopter.  Twisted.  Yeah.  There's not much, uh, it's not much, uh, going on there to help, you know, to protect  you.  No.  It's tinfoil.  Pretty much.  That's what planes, uh, that's what aircraft are. 
[00:33:30]  It's tinfoil where they strengthen what they have to.  And the rest is, uh, left off for weight consideration.  This guy, Joe says he knows a lot about what happened.  Joe.  Hey, what's going on guys?  Hey, Joe.  What's the good word?  Um, yeah, that whole space along the Hudson river there, it's called uncontrolled airspace.  Meaning you don't need a flight plan, anything up to 1100 or 1300 feet.  So anybody can fly anywhere.  You just go on a certain radio frequency and all you do is call out your position.  So it's not really that, uh, that well organized. 
[00:34:00]  That sounds just to stop you fucked up knowing how, how many, how much stuff is in the air  in that area.  You're just taking, you're just like figuring it out yourself.  What?  That, that information?  No, I mean, you're, yeah, you're flying and you just got to figure out where everybody else  is on your own for the most part.  Yeah.  Well, like the one rule in uncontrolled airspace is see and be seen.  So you, you have to tell everyone where you're at, what your altitude is, you're heading.  And it's almost like a highway, you know, where you drive on the right side. 
[00:34:30]  If you're going northbound, left side, if you're going southbound.  Right.  Nerve wracking.  That's why I tend to think this helicopter just blasted off into, uh, into the, the bottom  of the, the plane.  I don't know.  It's one of the, it's a weird situation.  Well, Joe said he knew a lot about this.  He gave us one point and then hung up.  That's what he does.  That's what he does now.  That's it.  That's it for you.  I'm not doing anything else.  How was your weekend, Ant? 
[00:35:00]  Wonderful.  Yeah.  God damn Yankees sweeping the Sox.  Yeah.  Six and a half games ahead now.  Na, na, na, na, na, na.  Na, na, na, na, na, na.  It's about time though.  Yeah, I know.  And it's Red Sox owned him this year.  It was coming off the heels of them not even winning a game.  And then they just sweep him at the stadium.  That was, uh, that was quite pleasurable.  I, um, have a brand new iPhone.  What?  Yes.  It's brand new. 
[00:35:30]  Look at it.  What happened?  The other one that ended up in the pool?  Why wouldn't it?  How'd it end up in the pool?  Because I'm an idiot.  Yeah.  And I, um.  Did you jump in the pool or did you get pushed?  No, no, no.  This was, uh, this is plain and clear stupidity on my part.  Um, I have my shorts on and, uh, yeah.  Hmm.  And, uh, I had been in the pool earlier, uh, but the shorts were completely dry.  And I made sure I'm going, I don't want to put my iPhone in damp pants here. 
[00:36:00]  So I checked and it's like, all right, it's dry.  So I put it in my pocket to do something for a second.  And during that second, my goldfish mind totally forgot that it was in, in my pocket.  So I go and sit in the jacuzzi and I'm like, ah, so my shorts are kind of like bubbling  up, you know, you get a lot of air in there.  So I'm like, I want to squeeze the air out.  So that was just your Italian ball bag trying to get to the surface, trying to reach some 
[00:36:30]  air, like a snorkel.  Right.  And I'm pushing the air out.  So it's like out of one leg and then I go out of the other one and I feel something.  I go, what is this?  There's something kind of rectangular in my pocket and I, oh no, oh no.  And I didn't even try to like quickly go, oh, oh, I just like, you know, slowly took it.  Yeah.  I'd been in there for probably 10 minutes.  So I slowly took it out of my pocket and just went like, all right. 
[00:37:00]  And then I hold it up to Danny and just go, ah, check it out.  He just starts laughing at me like I'm an ass because I'm an ass.  Did you have to pay full price for the other one or no?  Oh, absolutely.  They don't give a shit.  What I could have done, there was an option to go to some other service person thing,  get put on some list that would have taken a week.  And then they give you one that's probably refurbished for like 180 bucks or something 
[00:37:30]  like that.  And I was just like, I got, you know, how much does it cost you to know it?  700 bucks?  No, it's like four and change.  That sucks.  It's like, yeah, a little mistake-y on Ant's part there.  But the good thing was I had just backed up the phone that day.  Oh, you're lucky.  That day I backed everything up.  So I was just able to pop it on within like a half hour.  Everything's right back to normal.  Can you dry out an iPhone?  No. 
[00:38:00]  Water is fucking kryptonite.  I've heard people say-  Because you could dry out a BlackBerry, I guess if it gets moist.  Maybe if it's in a jacuzzi for 10 minutes, probably not.  Yeah, they say like, well, put it in a thing of rice.  All that crap, right?  I got all that thing.  You go, put it in a thing of rice for a few days.  First of all, I can't be without a phone for a few days.  Are you drying it out just to see?  I would.  Oh, I have three dead iPhones now that are in a drawer.  So turn them on in a week or two to see if they work.  One is the one I got pushed in the pool with. 
[00:38:30]  Last summer.  One is the one that just got fucked this weekend.  And then the other one is the original first generation one.  Right.  That I had replaced when they came out with a better one.  But you know what happens?  Everything fogs up.  And water got in between the screen and stuff.  So you could see water when you pushed on the screen.  Oh, fuck.  And it just doesn't-  It's not going to work.  And by the way, there is a certain salt content in the pool.  So you're going to get some corrosion. 
[00:39:00]  Yeah, absolutely.  It just ain't going to work.  I got to tell you, I got an iPhone-  No, I was wearing shorts.  Somebody says, don't you mean a bathing suit?  No, he wears shorts.  It's like I wear kind of shorts with pockets and stuff.  I don't wear a Speedo.  No one wears Speedos, though.  Well, no.  Unfortunately, people wear Speedos.  At your house?  No.  Oh, you scared me.  No, Keith is naked when he jumps in the pool.  He wasn't there.  Yeah.  I got an iPhone at home.  Yeah.  And I'm looking at it very closely lately. 
[00:39:30]  Yeah.  Because the fucking video on the BlackBerry sucks a dick.  It really does.  I'm at the UFC thing.  I want to take videos.  I was too scared of bringing my HD flip.  So I'm like, all right, I'll take some videos with my BlackBerry.  I only posted one because the quality sucks.  And I do have the iPhone at home.  I'm like, I think I might have to start this fucker up.  Fire that bitch up.  Do you have a video iPhone at home?  Yeah, I got it.  The video is good, man.  Yeah, because the guys I was with, they all had their iPhones.  They're taking pretty good videos.  I'm like, motherfucker. 
[00:40:00]  If the BlackBerry doesn't figure this out soon, they're going to lose a lot of business.  The video is great.  It is great?  Yeah.  I know it's better than the BlackBerry.  I have to get that.  It looks fantastic.  I've taken video off of this, and it just looks really good.  It's actually a good volume.  The whole thing is really good.  It's almost like if you have a video of yourself dancing on it,  you know, you can just...  Why are you dancing, Jimmy?  No reason.  Why are you dancing?  I just had to.  I had to, so I decided to say it.  Who are you dancing with? 
[00:40:30]  I don't like this part.  Oh, it's awful.  Oh, my God.  I've got to see that.  No, no, no, no, no.  I can't see from you.  Oh, it ended.  Well, I didn't even.  Let me see your iPhone, Jimmy.  Let me see you.  I'll show you later.  Let me see you dancing.  That's adorable.  I'll show you a little later.  Look how ready he's getting.  Is there a reason you were dancing that you want to share with everyone?  It was at the end of the Furry Vengeance.  The cast does it.  Oh, okay.  And we had to rehearse.  Had to do it.  I didn't mind because everybody had to do it.  We forgot to tell everyone.  When you and I were walking out Friday, we ran into... 
[00:41:00]  I forget his name every time.  Ken Jeong.  I think he's saying it Jeong.  Ken Jeong or Ken Jeong.  Yeah.  From Role Models, from The Hangover, he showed his tiny little weenie.  We should have asked him.  Oh, well, that's on the air.  Why didn't we ask him?  Because we're on the air.  We're nice people off the air.  He had the tiny, tiny little fucking nothing of a wiener in The Hangover when they pulled  him out of the trunk.  That guy, he's in every movie now.  He's going to be in The Goods.  That opens up this weekend.  He's in the movie that Jimmy filmed.  The Furry Vengeance.  The Furry Vengeance.  And see, there's me and Patrice kind of dancing a little bit. 
[00:41:30]  Oh, my God.  I just saw one move of yours.  Are you allowed to post that anyway?  I don't think so.  I don't know.  Maybe after the movie comes out.  Yeah, but it wasn't, it was shot, we're just, it was up in the house, we're rehearsing.  So it's, I don't know.  In the house.  In the house.  In the hizzing.  In the house.  Motherfucking in the house.  Oh, that's so funny.  Not good.  Oh.  But he was a nice dude.  He was a great dude.  He, it turns out he's a, he's a fan of Jimmy Norton and a fan of our radio show. 
[00:42:00]  Or so he says.  Well, yeah.  But he did recognize the name of the show when, when we introduced ourselves and he  was here and we didn't get him on the show Friday.  What the fuck?  Someone fucked up bad on that one.  I sent that an email when I saw his name.  And he was such a nice guy because he, he plays such weird roles in the movies.  It's, it's, it's strange to think he's the same, the same person.  He was a standup, I think too.  Really?  Mm-hmm.  So hopefully we'll get him in this week because I think he's in, he is in the goods. 
[00:42:30]  I don't know how big his role is, but.  Uh, let me go to Kent, the movie guy.  What does he need today?  Kent.  Hey guys, uh, kind of like the critics are calling this whole summer movie season a bust  officially after this past weekend.  Hmm.  Really?  The what buddy?  What, what came out?  G.I. Joe.  Uh, G.I. Joe, which was the last blockbuster and it was the biggest pile of shit I have ever  seen.  Marlon Wayans and who else?  Uh, Channing Tatum, who nobody cares about.  I mean, Sienna Miller was in it. 
[00:43:00]  I just, overall, it was just a bad movie.  What is, what is it getting on Rotten Tomatoes?  I, I, I thought it was going to be a huge hit.  It made 56 million.  Yeah.  Critically, I mean, it's okay.  I mean, uh, box office, it's okay, but the critics hated it.  I mean, I went on Friday and the theater was empty.  What was the problem with the movie?  Uh, it's 10 years behind the time as far as special effects go.  I don't know.  The single special effect in the movie, it looks worse than video games I'm playing now. 
[00:43:30]  Are you kidding?  Really bad.  Yeah.  And then, uh, the whole end of the movie is ripped right out of Star Wars.  Really?  Like, yeah.  You know, bad guys have the huge base with the giant death ray and the good guys come  in in their ships and try to attack it and take it out.  Are you shitting me?  I'm not shitting you.  And it's all underwater.  And that's the twist.  It was fucking horrendous.  Nobody, uh, Marlon Wayans is maybe the most annoying actor in, I've ever seen.  All he does is crack lines and everyone else tries to look serious and, uh. 
[00:44:00]  That's just shitty writing though, dude.  That, that's just shitty.  Hey, give the black guy the crazy.  That's how they destroyed Independence Day by making Will Smith do that fucking nonsense.  It does have that vibe.  All the douche chills you would get from Independence Day you'd get from this.  And what really sucks is you had kind of a good cast, like, uh, Mr. Echo from Lost.  I can't pronounce that guy's name to save my life.  I actually do a great impression of him.  Oh, do you?  Yeah.  Go ahead.  I am Mr. Echo.  Go ahead.  That's perfect.  Yeah, it is.  I know, I've been told. 
[00:44:30]  Go ahead, sir.  Oh!  Yeah.  This is my brother.  Uh, what do you think of, uh, like, I want to see District 9.  No shit.  District 9 I saw, and it is fucking sweet.  See, that looks like it's going to be pretty good.  Wait, why didn't it come out in the summer then?  It's coming out, uh, the 14th?  It's coming out next week, but next week, I mean, schools are already starting to, you  know, pick up, and it's a rated R film.  I mean, it's not really a huge summer movie, and it's way too smart to throw in with the 
[00:45:00]  rest of the, you know, popcorn films.  You know what?  You make a great point.  I'm glad the summer fucking season's over, because it's mindless movies, basically.  Yeah.  I need a little something going on.  Transformers was fucking horrible.  Terminator just pissed off a whole lot of people and disappointed fans.  Right.  Almost everything, anything that was good was held over from Christmas.  Harry Potter was kind of decent, but boring.  Right.  And then, uh, Star Trek was supposed to come out five months before it did, but Paramount  knew they had shit on their hands and said, oh, let's wait until the summer so that it's 
[00:45:30]  not a complete critical bomb.  Well, you said it was a disappointing summer, but you've got to remember Star Trek did come  out.  Star Trek was great.  Yeah, Star Trek was great.  It could have come out five months before that.  They held it back just so they had some kind of hit on their hands.  What is District 9 about?  I just need to know one thing about District 9.  Is there going to be a heavy-handed message about, like, um, you know, race relations or something 
[00:46:00]  that's, uh, in some kind of, you know, subtle, uh, bullshit?  Anthony, you're going to hate that part of it, but at the same time, this is the most  brutal science fiction action movie I've seen in a long time.  Don't let the trailers, like, make you think it's this, uh, little film.  It is big.  It is brutal.  It looks great, and the CGI looks great.  The CGI is really good.  The director started doing, uh, pretty good effects on TV shows and started off doing, 
[00:46:30]  like, really good stuff on a minimalist budget, so he was able to keep it small, contained,  keep it away from the studios, do his own thing, and made a really fucking sweet movie.  Wait, why was the alien's face bleeped out?  I don't know why it was cute, uh, pixelated.  The first part of the movie starts out like a documentary.  Oh, okay.  And then it, so you kind of get a Cloverfield, Blair Witch, CNN, you know, Dateline News  feel type of thing going on, uh, but then the movie transitions into this really brutal 
[00:47:00]  action film where, I mean, the violence is some of the best gore I've seen in a long time.  And it's Peter Jackson, too, who did King Kong.  He presents.  Yeah, I mean, and Peter Jackson's this whole gore hound.  That guy loves his violence more than most major directors.  A big boy.  Yeah, he is.  See, apparently aliens came here, uh, years ago, and, um, they're, you know, not welcome.  They put them in a certain place.  Yeah.  And cordoned them off, and then there's some kind of problem. 
[00:47:30]  It's Planet of the Apes.  Their ship, uh, is a life raft.  With spaceships.  Stuck.  Oh, that big ship there, you think, is a life raft, huh?  It's a life raft.  That's why they're not able to leave.  And they can't leave, so they're kind of stuck here, but we kind of treat them, you know,  like, uh, you know.  That's why all over different cities there are, you know, uh, all these, there's a pretty  really awesome marketing campaign behind the whole film with, uh, aliens not allowed,  humans only.  There are banners all over San Francisco for that.  Uh, oh, God, it probably is some veiled social, I hate the social message. 
[00:48:00]  I don't want veiled social message, but as long as it's disgusting and gruesome, I'll  go see it.  There, but you won't care, and it really is, it is smartly written, it is really well  done.  And then, uh, you know, you got Inglourious Bastards coming out in a couple weeks, I believe.  Yeah, I want to see that one, too.  That movie is fucking awesome.  Tarantino is really on his game with it.  Looks very violent, which I like.  We're looking forward to that.  Yeah, really violent.  Don't expect, like, a war film.  Uh, like, you know, Saving Private Ryan, but it is a fucking great action film. 
[00:48:30]  What was your favorite movie of the summer, Kent?  Uh, Star Trek.  Star Trek.  Everything else Let Me Down.  I haven't seen Star Trek yet.  Moon was really good, but Moon was an indie film.  What was it called?  Moon, it was, uh, Duncan Jones, uh, David Bowie's son's first, uh, film.  All right.  I starred Sam Rock.  Yeah, what the fuck?  Wait a minute.  It was really fucking good.  Did that, when the hell did that even come out?  You know what?  It came and left.  I mean, you might be able to still find it at a small indie theater, and I mean, if you  request it, I'm sure Duncan Jones would hook you guys up with a screener. 
[00:49:00]  Yeah, because I wanted to see that.  I saw the trailer for it, and I was like, wow, that looks pretty cool.  What is it called?  Yeah.  The Moon?  Yeah, it's called Moon.  Okay.  And then, yeah, uh, what, and when the fuck is Star Trek gonna be on, like, DVD?  It comes out on DVD and Blu-ray in November.  You didn't explain why the Moon's a great movie, though.  I don't even know what it's about.  Moon is about a guy who's on the moon, and his whole job is to sit there and send a new  natural resource they found on the moon back to Earth, and he's only gonna be there for  three more weeks, and he wants to go home, see his kid, be with his wife. 
[00:49:30]  He's been up there for three years, and he starts to go crazy.  Yeah.  Pretty cool concept.  And the less you know about the movie, though, the better, because it's amazing.  Don't let anyone tell you anything else about it.  All right, thank you.  Because it is amazing.  Awesome.  Well, Julie and Julia, good news, was in second place at the box office over the weekend.  Oh, great.  That was the one Nick DiPaolo was beating the shit out of last week.  Oh, deservedly.  Made $20 million. 
[00:50:00]  Good, it sure looks terrific.  Yeah.  Will she cook?  Won't she cook?  I have no idea.  You have to go see it?  $20 million, though.  You think, how many fucking dumb broads dragged their fucking castrated boyfriends and husbands  to that lump of shite?  Never.  They dragged me to it.  Oh.  You went to that?  I fell asleep.  I fell asleep.  We went to like a 10.30 showing.  I fell asleep.  Boring.  Dude.  It is so boring.  If you get dragged to a movie like that, you gotta go like two in the afternoon so you 
[00:50:30]  don't...  Well, I guess it would be better if you went late so you could snooze through the whole thing  and have an excuse.  Good point.  Yeah.  It's fucking horrendous.  All those movies are really, really bad.  But G.I.  Joe, Pat from Menachie saw it.  Uh-huh.  Yeah.  G.I.  Joe is okay.  Just a little cartoony.  And then, I guess this was in the movie.  He quotes it.  Get them, Joes.  Oh, yeah.  I mean, they have the...  Do they actually say, get them, Joes?  They have that.  They have Yo-Jo.  They have a Kung Fu grip joke. 
[00:51:00]  They have a realistic hair joke.  All these...  Like, any hack fucking G.I.  Joe line you could put in that movie.  Yeah.  Yeah.  And it's hammered in so poorly.  And it's all by Marlon Wayans, of course.  All of it is by Marlon Wayans.  He was great in Requiem for a Dream.  That's just shitty, fruity Hollywood writing.  Yep.  Really bad.  And it's so behind the times.  Everything about it was like...  It's so weird.  It looks like 1995. 
[00:51:30]  All the special effects were so bad.  Cheap.  Was the movie filmed a while ago, and they finally fixed it up a little bit and threw it at us?  No, no, no.  They made it right away.  What the problem was, after the writers' strike, every big Hollywood film was going to suck.  It just was bound to happen.  Right.  And this entire summer was a casualty, except for holdovers.  All right.  Well, good job, Kent.  I didn't expect a little movie thing early in the morning. 
[00:52:00]  Well, thank you.  I'll talk to you later.  Anthony, I got Blu-rays for all you guys, actually.  I'll be sending them out this week.  Very nice.  Thank you, sir.  Oh, I like that, Kent.  Yes.  Very nice.  Send them out.  Send them away.  Any requests, though?  I mean, I get free Blu-rays.  Any requests from you guys?  Star Trek.  Well, I'm not going to get that until then.  Give me Star Trek.  I'm going to give you a screener copy.  Let me call some guys.  I'd love to.  I've only seen half of it.  Yes, one that's not choppy.  Give me the moon.  I want to see this moon movie.  Yeah, I want to see moon.  Duncan Jones, the director.  He's a really easy guy to talk to, so I'll talk to him. 
[00:52:30]  And actually, Jimmy, there was another movie I wanted to tell you about called Bronson.  Bronson?  What do you use this for, jerking off?  It's about Britain's most dangerous criminal.  It's a true story.  Oh.  Clockwork Orange, one of the most brutal films I've seen in a long fucking time.  Brilliant movie.  I'd love to see that.  I'll send you guys a screener copy of that as well, because I've got them laying around.  Okay.  All right, Ken.  Thank you.  There you go.  Thank you.  All right.  KTMG. 
[00:53:00]  I know Pat from Monocle is listening.  He was represented at the Joe Rogan show at Helium Comedy Club.  Joe made some line and then did a Pat Monocle.  I went, meh, meh.  I said, Pat from Monocle.  Yeah.  I just went, meh, meh, meh, meh, meh, meh, meh, meh.  Want to take our first break?  Why not?  And you were talking about the Yankees.  Just, well, Jason Giambi, who used to play for the Yankees, was released.  Oh, he's done, huh?  His average was 193.  193. 
[00:53:30]  It was worse than old baseball.  What happened?  What happened?  Let's see.  Hmm.  I wonder what could have changed between the time he was slugging fucking balls over the  wall and now.  What?  Does it change your eyesight?  You would think instead of, like, monstrous home runs, you would at least get doubles.  Yeah, right?  Something.  Does it change your eyesight if you're...  A little blooper.  If you're off the juice, if that's what was going on there?  Or caused that?  I don't know.  Big drop?  Yeah, you think he...  Well, he probably just doesn't have the juice to get it over the... 
[00:54:00]  Over the wall, so people are catching him.  He's done.  And quick mention, Tiger Woods won again, two weeks in a row.  He's got 70 career victories.  He's only three behind Jack Nicholson.  Wow.  Jack Nicholson.  Jack Nicholson is golfing?  I'm Nicholas.  I always make that mistake every fucking time.  Yeah, Jack Nicholson has 73 wins, and Tiger now has 70.  And Jack Nicholson had 70 wins when he was 40, I think, and Tiger's only 33.  Jesus Christ.  Amazing.  And that's it for golf today, because no one gets a shit in general. 
[00:54:30]  Opie and Anthony, stay there.  People!  People!  Chili Peppers.  I was watching Point Break over the weekend. 
[00:55:00]  Oh, really?  I haven't seen that in so fucking long.  I don't even remember the movie anymore.  Anthony Kudis is in it.  Is he really?  Yeah, he's the guy who gets shot in the foot.  I was going to...  All right.  Sorry.  But it's one of Keanu's best, I believe.  And Swayze.  When you put Keanu and Swayze in the same movie, you can't lose.  It's surfing.  It's bank robbery.  It's, yeah.  Swayze with his mullet.  Fantastic movie.  Swayze's best work since Roadhouse, I think. 
[00:55:30]  What do you think?  Swayze's better in...  Well, Swayze's better in Roadhouse.  Roadhouse rules.  I'm not going to say, but...  Roadhouse rules.  Point Break, you got to give him that.  Point Break was a good movie.  What I remember.  I don't remember that movie as much.  That's one I got to go watch again.  Yeah, that's a...  Wow.  You sit there and go, ooh.  Is it really bad?  Ooh.  What are some of the awful moments?  Terrible lines?  It doesn't hold up?  No.  Because when it came out, people were really into Point Break for a while.  I know.  It's really silly.  Cheesy?  It's just cheesy. 
[00:56:00]  Everything about it is cheesy.  And Keanu is just...  He's just awful.  Of course he is.  He is so bad at...  He's not an actor.  How is he in such...  So many movies and so many, like, hits?  It worked for The Matrix.  Yeah, yeah.  It really did.  I'm the one.  But the rest of his movies, Speed.  He takes out his speed.  Speed, yeah.  Go back and watch that movie.  You want to see how bad his acting was.  That was just on last night, as a matter of fact.  Was it really?  Speed, yeah.  Caught a little of that.  I was trying to find a good movie to fall asleep to. 
[00:56:30]  And it just kept getting later and later because I was going through everything.  I was going...  Point Break 2 is coming out?  Yeah.  Well, wow.  It's just in time.  With who?  20 years later.  I know.  What the fuck are they doing?  I was trying to find a movie to fall asleep to.  So, because, you know, I need the TV on because I can't live with my own thoughts.  I need some kind of external sound or some type of visual...  Some kind of visual.  Visual...  Something.  And I went through every on-demand movie, every on-demand, like HBO, Cinemax, Starz, everything. 
[00:57:00]  Nothing.  The only thing that was possibly on, but I got so annoyed, was AMC, American Movie Classics.  Is that it?  American Movie...  Yes.  ...is the biggest waste of a fucking channel.  They play movies almost like they're like, we're the American Movie Classics.  Don't worry.  You'll watch this movie.  And then it's hacked to shit.  Oh, really?  With commercials.  It's like TBS. 
[00:57:30]  Don't try to fucking fake me out by calling it American Movie Classics.  So, last night, Pulp Fiction's on.  So, I'm just like, ah, let me throw it on there.  And they're freaking, they're saying freaking instead of fucking, they cut out entire scenes.  You can't call yourself the American Movie Classic if you're changing how the movie was originally presented.  Entire scenes.  She, when Mia Wallace snorts the heroin in her house, and John Travolta's having a little conflict with himself in the bathroom. 
[00:58:00]  You drink your drink.  You leave.  You go home.  That's what you're going to do.  Yeah, yeah, and they cut out the jerk-off part, of course, because it's all you're going to do.  And she finds the heroin.  She snorts it and goes, ah, ah.  And she's like on the floor.  The next scene is them driving in his car with Mia next to him and him calling up Lance.  And it's like, what about when he comes out and goes, oh, fuck, oh, shit, Mia, wake up.  And you realize the severity of her overdose at that point. 
[00:58:30]  Because there's, like, the fucking $5 shake is coming out of her mouth.  And they cut that whole scene out.  That's an amazing scene in Pulp Pitcher.  It's great.  It sets up the fact that she's really fucking OD'd here.  Right.  AMC, they play really good movies, but, like, hacked to shit.  Hacked to shit.  I saw Fight Club was on AMC over the weekend as well.  Why would you bother?  And, like, there was nothing else on, so I was like, fuck it.  I threw it on.  Yeah.  And, uh.  So you're walking at the DVD and popping in?  I haven't.  It's just installation.  I know.  Everyone does that, though. 
[00:59:00]  Enough with the edited movies.  It's horrible.  It makes, it just looks stupid, considering how easy it is to get DVDs and how fucking easy  it is to see them on movie channels.  It's primitive.  There's 30 movie channels.  And considering the edits that they made, especially in Fight Club, the one that I saw  that I was like, I can't believe they just cut that out.  Like, they don't have a problem with, you know, Tyler Durden putting a gun in a guy's face.  Like, that's fine.  You can put that on TV.  But condoms in a toilet bowl.  You can't have it.  You can't have it.  And then another scene from Pulp Fiction that they completely fucked up. 
[00:59:30]  Oh, I was watching to see if they fucked this up.  Now I was just captivated to see how are they going to get this scene on TV.  Uh, was the scene with, uh, the watch.  Okay.  Where Walken comes in with the watch.  Because he's got to say ten times that it's up his ass.  Can I guess?  Up my nose.  No.  They actually said, I put this miserable piece of hunk of metal up my ass.  Okay.  And they used that.  But then they cut out where he goes, I'll be dabbed if I let those slopes take your birthright. 
[01:00:00]  They said something else for a slope.  Of course.  Which was, you know, the Vietnamese derogatory term that was used all, all the time with  the soldiers in Vietnam.  Yeah, let's make believe it was never used.  I don't get that one either.  So they cut that out and replaced it with something.  I, believe me, I couldn't understand what he was saying.  I wonder if they're going to do roots again, but they're going to say you N-word.  Are they going to change it like that just to wipe it out so it's never been historically used?  Right, exactly.  Do that.  Just silly.  So then I got so disgusted that I fell asleep to a wonderful movie, Schindler's List. 
[01:00:30]  On AMC?  No, no.  I did that.  It was a regular movie channel.  And you slept like a baby.  Oh, slept like a baby.  It was great.  God, that movie.  It was a great movie, though.  Yes, it's a fucking amazing movie.  Holy shit.  I mean, not just, you know, watching fucking Nazis do what they do, but just the whole thing.  Like, he was really good.  What's his name?  Liam Neeson.  Liam Neeson was so fucking good in that movie.  He won the Oscar.  Did he really? 
[01:01:00]  For Schindler's List?  Yeah.  All right.  I don't remember who wins the Oscar.  Best picture, I think.  After it's over, I forget.  Spielberg won director, finally, for that one.  I think everyone won for that.  Yeah, that was just a fucking amazing movie.  At the end, when they show the Schindler survivors and the actors that played them walking, it  was fucking great.  You realize, like, what a fucking impact the guy had.  Yeah.  Huge.  Very good.  That was a great fucking movie.  You know, speaking of movies, when are they going to just let us watch whatever fucking movie  we want when we want?  What are they waiting for?  Getting there with the Netflix streaming.  Getting there. 
[01:01:30]  But I'm just talking about the cable shit.  Yeah, well, cable's always going to fucking hold shit back.  Hey, I got 20 movie channels.  Let's watch a movie tonight.  And you just, I'm going to say what everyone does.  You just, no, no, no, no.  And then you get a movie in your head, like, you know, something you haven't seen in a while.  Like, you know, I want to see that movie.  One of these movie channels has to have it somewhere.  Yeah.  And it's never there.  It was, it took me 15 to 20 minutes to go through every movie thing.  Yeah, that's what I do. 
[01:02:00]  Where it started getting, like, really late.  And I'm going, now I'm not even going to be able to watch a movie because it's getting  late.  And then I was going to watch that Benjamin Buttons movie.  And I saw, it's like, this is a fucking, like, five hour movie.  It's a long fucking movie.  I can't watch this fucking thing.  Benjamin Buttons?  I haven't seen that yet.  Benjamin Buttons.  I haven't seen it yet either.  So I was going to watch that.  And then I looked and went, there's no fucking way.  That's a long movie.  So, you know, you put on a little Schindler's.  That's long too.  But I figured I would just go to sleep to it anyway.  You know what?  They show movies on the pier. 
[01:02:30]  Sort of where I live.  And I got some visitors from Florida.  So I settled them in to see a movie so I could go to bed.  But I watched the first 20 minutes.  It's an old Henry Fonda movie.  Someone has to help me out.  He's some kind of, like, fucking.  The Oxbow incident?  What?  I don't know.  I don't know.  You answered before he even.  It's an old Henry Fonda movie.  It's a Henry Fonda movie.  Oh, he didn't win?  Sorry.  I was wrong about Liam Neeson.  I thought he won for that.  Hank's won for Philadelphia. 
[01:03:00]  Oh, geez.  That's some tough competition right there.  It was great, though.  Aids are retard.  Hank's will always win.  So it was a Henry Fonda movie.  It was some old western.  And how he treated his wife in the movie like they're newlyweds.  And then they take off to start a life, you know, for themselves.  Maybe someone knows the movie.  I don't know.  Maybe Ken could call back.  It's not that important.  But it's so funny to see these old movies.  I mean, this movie, Henry Fonda was young.  Yeah.  And his new wife is freaking out and she's scared. 
[01:03:30]  So he just belts her one and goes, you needed that.  And then he's got some Indian friend because he goes back to his little tiny little house in the woods in the middle of nowhere.  And he's a soldier and he's got an Indian friend who saw the commotion with the wife where he slapped her really hard and goes, you needed that.  You needed to calm down.  And then the Indian comes back with a stick and suggests that he beat his new wife to get her in shape.  And I was like, I got her to listen.  And the person I'm visiting is, well, I guess we could, a lot of people could relate. 
[01:04:00]  I got like a niece.  She's like 15 or 16 and she's kind of like a vegetarian and a bit on the liberal side.  And she was just horrified.  I'm like, well, this is just how it was.  Relax.  Oh, Jesus.  They don't treat women like this anymore.  Relax.  You should have smacked her and said, hey, shut up and watch this.  Exactly.  You needed that.  You needed that.  Right.  I forgot the name of the movie, but it was hilarious because he just belts her. 
[01:04:30]  And it was totally acceptable when this movie came out.  It wasn't some outrageous thing.  This was just normal behavior they were showing.  Is she hot?  Oh, my niece.  What's wrong with you?  It's a fair question.  It's a fair question.  I wasn't coming across with any ulterior motives.  Look at me and put boobs on me.  Is it still hot?  Phenomenal.  And younger?  Phenomenal.  Your sister's cute.  I'm just saying.  It's my older sister from Florida.  Yeah?  She was at the wedding.  Is she hot? 
[01:05:00]  If you paid attention to my wedding, you would know.  I was there.  I don't remember who she was.  I couldn't pay attention.  I was behind a stanchion.  I had to keep you guys under control.  I was behind a structural fucking...  There was allegations that there was a wedding ceremony happening.  It's hard to see with the fucking giant column.  It was a huge column.  I should have put thermite paint on it.  Jackass.  Thermite paint.  Oh, this is...  Thermite.  I can't get him. 
[01:05:30]  They reward bad behavior.  Right, do they?  Yeah.  Johnny Cleveland.  How are you, John?  Hey there, Jan.  Morning, boys.  How are you?  Welcome aboard.  God bless.  Thanks, Jimmy.  Hey, Professor.  You still wondering why you're having crazy dreams?  It's because you fall asleep with the TV on.  No, I've always fallen asleep with the TV on, and I always have crazy dreams, but that's...  Well, that's exactly why.  It doesn't usually have anything to do with the dreams, and there have been times I've  fallen asleep without a TV on, and I still have wacky dreams. 
[01:06:00]  What kind of wacky dreams?  Every night, I have dreams that I am being chased.  I am being...  There are people trying to get into wherever I am.  They're stealing my car.  They're doing things.  And then I never have what I need to thwart an incident.  Every night is the same dream?  Different locations, though.  Different cast.  Different things.  That sounds tiring.  Sometimes it's a hotel.  Sometimes it's an old house I used to live in.  Sometimes it's a variation of my house now, but it doesn't look like it, but it's supposed  to be. 
[01:06:30]  Then sometimes there are people I know in it.  Sometimes I don't know.  But if I look out a window in my dream, there'll always be bad people out there trying to do  bad things.  And then I'll pick up a gun, and the bullets won't fit, or I can't find the right clip.  It's just annoying.  Don't you ever have a good dream?  A little sex dream or something?  Oh, I have sex dreams.  They're great.  I've said this before.  When I know I'm dreaming, which happens a lot, I'll be in a dream, and something so outrageous 
[01:07:00]  is happening, or like, wow, I'm really fucked here, and I'll be like, wait a minute.  This didn't happen.  And I actually start thinking in my dream and going, oh, fuck, I'm dreaming.  Oh, this is great.  So the first thing I do is grab the nearest dream woman that's around and just ravagely  assault her.  You can't control your dreams.  No, I swear.  I need to...  Swear to you.  I need to ask an expert.  Can you really control your dreams?  It's called lucid dreaming, and the only problem with it is you're so close to the point of 
[01:07:30]  waking up that it's very hard to stay there in that level.  You're either going to fall back into where you don't know you're dreaming anymore, and  it changes it, or your eyes open and you go, fuck, I'm awake.  But that's pretty amazing if you can control that, because when I'm in that state and I  know it's a dream, I'm like, oh my God, this is a dream.  This is a dream.  This is a dream.  I'm waking up.  I'm waking up.  No, no, you got it.  It's like trying to calm yourself down and go, just stay asleep, stay asleep, stay asleep.  I go animal so fast, like, oh my God, I got to take advantage of this. 
[01:08:00]  I can do whatever I want.  Because you know you only have a few, like, seconds, maybe a minute or two.  Or drift back into dreamy land.  So I'll try to fly, because flying's cool.  I can't wait until you think it's a dream and it's not.  You fucking jump through your fucking bay window.  They find you in the bushes with a fucking cut up face and head.  How many shallow graves there are laying around, because I thought I was dreaming.  Hey, I want to go back to this old movie thing, because I was hoping this was going to start  something.  We got a couple calls already. 
[01:08:30]  Walt, what's up, Walt?  Hey, good morning, guys.  I think that movie was called Shenandoah.  Oh.  Was it a color movie?  You know what I mean?  In color?  Oh, come on, sir.  There's no way to talk about that.  Come on now.  I don't care who the cast was.  Never say it.  That's right.  Patch of Blue is a fine film.  It was in color, and they had a take on the Indians.  I mean, I only watched the first 20 minutes.  I watched The New Wife get slapped, and then possibly, oh, and then Henry Fonda takes the  stick?  Yeah.  And you're thinking he's going to go, oh, that's crazy. 
[01:09:00]  I forgot the name of his Indian friend that had some weird Indian name or whatever.  Of course he did.  Rainmaker.  He takes the stick, and he's right next to the fireplace, and there's a fireplace.  You know, the fire's a burn, and so I'm like, oh, he obviously is a good guy.  Because you don't realize this was normal behavior when the movie was filmed, so I'm  assuming he's just going to throw the stick in the fire like, oh, we obviously don't need  this.  Yeah.  He hangs it on his mantle.  It's like, it's a reminder, bitch.  Right.  It's just sitting right there.  Maybe it was Shenandoah. 
[01:09:30]  I don't know there, Walt.  Yep.  I think that was it, buddy.  You guys have a nice day.  Thanks a lot.  All right.  And then Greg in Maryland.  Here we go.  What's up, Greg?  A couple months ago, I saw a John Wayne movie, and I don't know the name of it, but he was  a wealthy rancher, and he and his wife were estranged.  And at the end of the movie, he takes his wife, and he spanks her.  Oh, it's hilarious.  Not in a sexy way?  No.  Oh, no.  Not in a, this is really outrageous, and you shouldn't be doing this.  Yeah.  They're just showing, like, you know, what the times were like when the movie was, you 
[01:10:00]  know, filmed.  That's how it was.  And what was acceptable.  The Duke and his 40 pounds of liverwurst in his colon.  Paddling his wife's fanny.  Our cable, this cannot be happening.  Patrick in Florida, please tell me this isn't true.  Go ahead.  Hello.  Oh, it's very true.  I looked into, there's no law that says a cable channel has to censor its content.  No, the FCC does not run it.  They're doing it for sponsors.  They do it for sponsors. 
[01:10:30]  Right.  Because they make money off of, it's not like HBO or Showtime or anything like that.  It's the regular commercial cable channels.  And, you know, if their sponsors find something offensive, they're going to pull their ads.  They can have any language they want on Comedy Central or on FX or on any of them.  Yeah, it just doesn't make sense to me.  They're going to make money by ruining a perfectly good book.  Slaves to the man is what they are, man.  Yeah, exactly.  Punch it out. 
[01:11:00]  Thank you.  Goodbye.  Bruce in Minnesota, he wants to say this, and I think we'll all be in agreement.  Blazing Saddles is the worst on regular TV.  Yeah, that is horrible.  Yeah, we don't even have to take your phone call, Bruce.  You're right on that one.  They chopped the shit out of that.  They add in parts that were edited out.  It's really amazingly bad.  You know any older movies where, like, the behavior is so just over-the-top ridiculous?  I was trying to think of some that was pretty good.  A lot of times, a hysterical woman will get slapped in the face and then go, oh, because she's hysterical. 
[01:11:30]  And then she's not upset that she just got slapped.  She's almost like, thank you for doing that.  I was out of control, and you calmed me down.  The grapefruit mush scene is good, too.  I can't remember the actor's name or actress, for that matter, but they're sitting, having breakfast.  That's, uh, Jesus.  Top of the world!  Oh, God.  That's James Cagney.  Cagney, right.  And he picks up half a grapefruit and just grabs the girl's fucking head and just smushes the grapefruit in her face. 
[01:12:00]  Especially a grapefruit, which is so acidic.  It really burned your eyes, I'm sure.  Do we have that, Danny?  I would love to see that on YouTube.  It is a good one.  James Cagney grapefruit.  Oh, we've shown that one before.  Yeah, it's a fun one.  I remember now, yeah, at the, uh, at the old place.  He's just like, wow, yo.  And he calls us something bad while he...  Yeah, we showed that scene over and over again in a loop.  We were out of our minds.  We have the volume on our show?  Oh, here it is.  Yeah, a little volume.  They're sitting there for breakfast.  Uh-oh.  A volume?  Hang on, hang on.  Is it you or me? 
[01:12:30]  I think it's me.  Oh, Dan.  Come on, you queer.  Dan.  You queer.  Go ready, Tom.  Ain't you got a drink in the house?  Well, not before breakfast, dear.  I didn't ask you for any lip.  I asked you if you had a drink.  I know, Tom, but...  Well, gee, I wish that...  There you go, that wishing stuff again.  I wish you was a wishing well.  So that I could tie a bucket to you and sink you. 
[01:13:00]  Maybe you found someone you like better.  He takes it and he basically shove-punches it into her face.  He punches her with the...  The look on his face, too.  He's just fucking miserable looking at her.  Hey, do you have Kiss of Death?  Find Widmark's fucking wheelchair scene.  Another one of my favorites.  He fucking...  Widmark goes looking for this guy, Peter, 
[01:13:30]  who he thinks is tattling.  And, of course, the mother's in a wheelchair.  She's, Peter's not here.  And Widmark is just not having it.  No.  He doesn't go for her explanation.  He'll have none of that.  What a great bad guy he was.  That is so fucking funny.  I wish you were a wishing well.  Okay, put...  Tie a bucket to you and sink you.  He has a fucking cigarette hanging out of his mouth.  He wants a drink before breakfast.  There she is in the wheelchair.  Oh, there she is.  Here we go.  It's Richard Widmark. 
[01:14:00]  God damn it.  Is he fucking...  He was good back then.  Oh, it's on.  It's on.  He's just looking around.  He sees the woman in the wheelchair.  The old broad in the wheelchair.  Yeah.  He's going to ask her a couple of questions.  He wants them answered immediately.  Your friend, Peter?  Peter.  Yeah.  Where's your squirt?  It's not home.  Come home late tonight, maybe.  After dinner sometime.  Maybe.  Where'd he go to?  Peter? 
[01:14:30]  How I know where Peter go.  Uptown, downtown.  There's a baller game.  Anywhere.  There's a baller game.  Oh, he is not pleased with her explanation.  He's not happy with that explanation at all.  Now he's walking through the house to find the squirt.  In the 40s, that was like calling somebody a cunt face.  Where's the squirt?  And now he sees that the guy's, like, drawers are all open from making a hasty getaway.  Of course he's been here.  He realizes the guy made, and his clothes were all gone, so he realizes the guy took off. 
[01:15:00]  And she's just bullshitting.  Look at that.  Old school wheelchair.  Yeah.  Yeah.  It was actually a chair with wheels.  Back at the dinner sometime.  Hmm?  Hmm.  Double crossing squealers bought you.  What's the matter?  I don't know nothing.  Some yellow squirt beat it, huh?  Took a parlor, huh?  That rat.  He's trying to decide what to do with this old bitch.  How am I going to fuck her up?  Where'd he go? 
[01:15:30]  I'm asking you, where's that squealing son of yours?  What?  You think a squealer can get away from me?  Huh?  With that hat.  Oh, he's the best.  You know what I do to squealing?  I let him have it in the belly.  So they can roll around for a long time thinking it over. 
[01:16:00]  She's just cowering.  Yeah, she knows it's not going to be good from here on out.  No.  And he looks down and he sees a fucking cord and he has a burst of inspiration.  He's a burst.  He's not just going to leave.  Telling me he's coming back.  Pulls the cord out.  You lying old hag.  The best line ever.  That's great.  Now he's tying her up in the wheelchair. 
[01:16:30]  You got to tie her to the wheelchair.  What, she going to get up and leave?  On a train, huh?  On a train.  Out she goes.  Here she goes to the old stepperoos.  I can't move.  I think.  Top of the stairs.  Top of the stairs.  Oh, boy.  She falls out.  She does a complete endo.  And that was a full 1940s building flight of steps. 
[01:17:00]  That wasn't.  You know it wasn't carpeted.  No, it was nice and hard.  That wasn't these little wraparound steps you see in office buildings.  That was.  I can look for a quarter mile and see the steps I have to climb.  He shoved her down the fucking steps.  Head first down the wheelchair.  You old hag.  You lying old hag.  You lying old hag.  See if you can find where he slaps Luigi in the face, too.  There's one where he's going to kill this guy, Nick.  And he wants to buy him dinner. 
[01:17:30]  You know, it's like a really weird scene.  And the other guy has the nerve to tell him that the kitchen is closed.  Oh, the nerve.  And he gives him just a good slap across his fat Italian.  It's how you want to treat somebody every time you see them.  Whether it's Bob or Voss or just anybody you want to slap.  As Danny finds that, Jeff in Houston.  Jeff.  How's up, boys?  Hey, Jeff.  Hey, that John Wayne movie is McClintock.  At the very end of the movie, somebody puts in his head that he needs to go teach his wife a lesson.  And so he's chasing her around town, knocking her through buildings and all this stuff. 
[01:18:00]  And the whole town's just following, laughing, encouraging.  She gets her clothes ripped off.  And they're all just giggling, chasing, and helping him out with.  And he finally gets her to the end and starts beating on her.  Somebody's picked a paddle in his hand.  So she's beating her.  He's beating her.  What happened to the phone?  I don't know.  His phone just got low.  Stop whispering.  Sir.  Hello?  Jeff.  Maybe it was his phone.  Yeah.  Your phone dropped out horribly.  I guess you want to say then the townsfolk encouraged him to spank her, right?  He got to help out. 
[01:18:30]  Yeah.  It was just like he's going into domestic abuse and they're all thinking it's hilarious.  Yeah.  He's probably got a bad self-help.  All right, man.  Thank you, sir.  Do you prefer Jeff or Jeffikins?  Yeah.  We lost it for the most part.  Let's go to Willie in Oklahoma.  Willie.  Yeah.  Hey.  Hey.  Hey.  All right.  You know what?  What happened around here over the weekend?  William.  Hold on, Williekins.  We can't hear you.  How does that just happen out of nowhere?  Like, everything was fine.  Everything was fine.  And then it's not fine anymore.  We're going to take a break.  I don't get it.  I want my phone. 
[01:19:00]  He had a great phone call.  We have a lot of great phone calls coming in.  And our phones are shut.  And that's what happens.  And that's what happens.  So fucking frustrating.  All right.  Well, let's get there.  Could just be a wire blown.  Let's get Mars in here.  See if we can chew on them.  All right.  We'll take a break.  See what's going on with the phones.  We'll continue with, you know, women abuse in old films.  Of course.  And other things.  Opie and Anthony.  Oh, yes.  Yes.  Opie and Anthony.  Amber.  Ah. 
[01:19:30]  Getting worried that Lady Gaga is a hermaphrodite?  What do you know on this, Sam?  Apparently, over the weekend, what would tylerdurdendude.com posted a quote from her that said she has  a little penis with her vagina.  She was born with boats.  She said it's not like a big deal.  It's just something.  I mean, I would assume that she's probably lying.  Yes.  She knows how to manipulate the media.  Just knowing they'll print anything that she says.  She says, it's not something that I'm ashamed of. 
[01:20:00]  Just isn't something that you go around telling everybody.  Yes, I have both male and female genitalia.  But I consider myself a female.  It's just a little bit of a penis and really doesn't interfere much with my life.  The reason I haven't talked about it is it's not a big deal to me.  Like, come on.  It's not like we all go around talking about our vag.  Vagges.  I think this is a great opportunity to make other multiple gendered people feel more comfortable  with their bodies.  I'm sexy. 
[01:20:30]  I'm hot.  I have both a poon and a peener.  Big fucking deal.  Does she want to use a giant clit or if it's a fucking actual dick?  I'm not sure all that is clipped and saved to be made into a promo or some bullshit with  me saying it like it's really me.  Danny made the side.  Oh, I know.  All Danny has to do is he puts his hands down like a chopping motion on either side.  Like, cut that out and save it.  Danny's like a third base coach.  Yeah.  Those signals he does to Travis.  Now, that sounds to me like a little goofy publicity thing. 
[01:21:00]  Yeah, she said she has a peener.  A peener and a poon and a peener.  Well, I figured she had a poon and peener in the morning.  Poon and peener.  I would listen to poon and peener every morning.  Poon and peener show.  Poon and peener.  Shock jocks poon and peener in trouble today.  Again.  This time it was poon.  What did poon say? 
[01:21:30]  At least you know who the hole is.  Poon and peener.  Poon and peener.  Weekday morning, 6 to 10 a.m.  Fucking poon and peener.  That's all I want to say now.  God damn.  Poon and peener.  Say it to yourself.  It's fun.  Poon and peener.  What?  I think it's bullshit.  You know what?  Scott from Hog Pog makes a very good point.  Let's remember.  A little bit of a penis is still a penis.  A penis.  I've seen a lot of shit on the internet. 
[01:22:00]  A lot.  And I've never seen a hermaphrodite.  Really?  I'm talking a cock and a vagina.  I've seen bitches with giant clits.  I've seen that shit.  And bitches with giant cocks.  I've seen bitches.  No.  But I've never seen a penis with a vagina where the balls are supposed to be.  Sorry.  Ain't seen it.  Well, there are.  I've seen photos of it.  Where? 
[01:22:30]  When?  I don't know.  Show me.  I need to jerk off.  I'm sure we can find them very easily.  We looked it up.  I would love to see that.  Is it true that there is a picture of her penis sticking out of her dress or something?  No.  I've never seen any penis sticking out of her dress.  So I'm going to say, look at the video clip of Lady Gaga's cock popping out of her dress  on www.tdd.com slash.  Oh.  That's it.  Yeah, that's it.  What?  Can you see her penis?  Yeah, it was just up.  Let's see her penis. 
[01:23:00]  That was it.  Yeah.  Well, you just had up.  That was it.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  You just had up.  Yeah.  And that was it.  That's it.  That little flesh.  Hold on.  Yes.  Booger Couch writes, Ken Jeong has a half a peener.  That's very true if you saw the hangover.  Jimmy, what are you looking at?  Anything?  Can't.  Can't see anything.  What the fuck are you seeing there?  No, it's lights.  Stop.  It's just lights and shit.  Stop it.  It's not a peener. 
[01:23:30]  No.  No peener?  Peener.  No.  All right.  Uh, Fetal Scraping Smith from the Bronx writes, 1955 movie with Sophie Loren, prompting her  boyfriend that he's not a real man.  He slugs her.  Uh-oh.  She then kisses him and yells, now you're a real man.  Ah!  You got to beat abroad.  And what?  Clinice, we got into this woman thing.  Chris, what do you got?  Uh, good evening. 
[01:24:00]  Hi.  Hello.  I think it was, uh, I play Drifter.  The chick slaps his face.  He picks her up.  He carries her across the street to the stables and makes the shit out of her.  And for the rest of the movie, she's in love with him.  Yeah, see?  That's how, uh, they, yeah, that's how you got the chick back then.  Well, Chris is the last...  I had to smack him.  Chris is the last phone call for today because our phones suck, so we have to take the phone  out of the game.  All right, that's like a big clit.  Wow, that's sexy.  Or something.  If it's a dick, it's not sexy.  Is that Lady Gaga?  If it's a dick, it's not sexy. 
[01:24:30]  No, it's not, but if it's a big clit, that's hot.  But if it's, like, beyond the point where it's actually a cock.  That's one of those giant thumb-sized clits, like fucking China has.  She has masculine hands, too.  Like China has.  What the fuck is going on there?  She may actually have bigger than a clit.  She's got a poon and a peener.  She would have said, I have a big clitoris or whatever.  She wouldn't have said, I have to peen it.  No chick with a big clit calls it a dick unless it really is.  Does a urethra run through it?  I love that movie.  Urethra runs through it.  Does a urethra run through it? 
[01:25:00]  Because that, to me, says it's either a peen or a clit.  That's where she got her name from, by the way.  Whenever guys see her without her penis, they're like,  Gah!  Gah!  Well, this is very good.  Well, Billy from Mrs.  See, we can't do the phones.  We need our phones.  Go to VHO.com for hermaphrodite photos.  Yeah?  Look under the bizarre section, by the way.  Yeah.  You've got to be careful, though. 
[01:25:30]  Oh.  Don't let your cat near the computer.  Oh, Uncle Paul.  Did your cat once, uh...  Had some problems.  That is such a fucking...  I don't know this story.  What's going on?  I saw it on the ticker on Fox News.  Yeah.  Giant, fucking Manhattan.  I'm waiting at a light, and I see the ticker on Fox News, and I'm reading this story, just laughing.  Apparently, a guy was in a little bit of a jam-up with some kiddie porn on his computer.  And he blamed it on his cat. 
[01:26:00]  His name is, uh...  He's 48.  And his name is Kenneth Griffin.  He was charged with 10 counts...  10?  ...of child porn.  They found, like, 1,000 child pornographic images.  And he told the detectives...  Naughty kitty.  ...he would leave his computer on, and his cat would jump on the keyboard.  Yep.  When he returned, there would be strange material downloaded.  Exactly.  He didn't say this.  Sometimes my cat right-clicks, save image as...  Yeah, that's just it. 
[01:26:30]  It's like...  So things are downloaded.  And what?  The cat then opens up a file, puts the pictures in a file, closes it down.  It has to be saved.  What is this?  This guy is so full of shit.  It's amazing.  The cat even knew my password.  Look at this grief.  How do you not love this guy?  What an asshole.  My fucking cat.  Best excuse ever.  It really is.  Beats out to Pete Townsend, excuse.  Yeah, researching a book. 
[01:27:00]  Does he think the jury's gonna buy that?  Who knows?  Uh, his cat.  In no fucking way.  A pet chimp would be more believable, because they're smarter.  Yeah.  They can...  Just banging on the keyboard.  They don't know any better.  Kitty porn popping up all over the place.  Let's try it out.  Let's get a cat in here and see if you can find fucking kitty porn.  How funny would it be if you did, and a cat knew exactly where to go, and he professionally  typed in...  With his little claws.  Yeah.  Very carefully.  Ticka, ticka, ticka.  With his claws.  Ticka, ticka, ticka.  For whatever reason, cats just dig child porn. 
[01:27:30]  I don't know why.  They don't know how wrong it is.  They think it looks like the kid's having fun.  They just don't understand the implications.  Stupid cats.  Cats love child porn.  I've been saying that for years.  For years.  I would find magazines under my cat's litter box.  Boo.  Some people are saying that they're mistaking it for kitty porn.  Where it is.  God damn it.  That isn't it.  There it is.  Yeah.  Cats don't understand the D and the T make a big difference. 
[01:28:00]  Yes.  You're going to get your owner in big trouble.  Scott from Hot Pog.  If the cat downloads it, then why don't you erase it?  Why didn't this guy erase the kitty porn?  Well, once it's there, we might as well.  The cat locked the file.  The cat had file lock.  It's a Mac.  Cat was the admin on the computer.  Yeah.  Cat.  Poor guy.  I can't change anything.  No settings.  The cat is the admin. 
[01:28:30]  All the favorites are like fucking cat sites.  Purina.com.  Fucking litter box sites.  It's like a right with the cat shit.  We get it.  Scratchingpost.org.  Constantly signs petitions to ban declawing.  Cat activists.  We get it, Jim.  And he downloaded, or he, the cat downloaded 1,000 pictures?  1,000, yeah.  1,000.  So it wasn't.  Yeah.  They're busy.  You know, cats are very nocturnal.  That's not even believable if it was only one. 
[01:29:00]  Yeah, you'd have a lot of explaining to do if it was one.  You know those stories where you have a cat or a dog where the owner is dying and they dial 911?  And it's like, miracle, a dog dialed 911, an emergency was sent over.  And you're like, wow, that's amazing.  It's not amazing.  Because you know how many people are dead on the floor with fucking the corner deli being called by the cat or dog? 
[01:29:30]  Or fucking, you know, just nothing to do with help whatsoever?  It was just a luck thing.  Yeah.  Every so often, you're going to get lucky.  But let me tell you something.  You don't get lucky that your cat downloads 1,000 child pornography pictures.  And no one's going to buy that.  This guy is so in jail.  And how does a cat keep calm as it downloads picture after picture after picture of those skittish fucks? 
[01:30:00]  He's just, oh, oh.  Take up.  His eyes are all bloodshot in the morning.  Cat's running an antivirus to make sure.  Stupid cat doesn't know an EXE file is bad.  No.  You hear about the bear that was eating the elderly woman?  No.  Yeah.  It was an elderly man.  Yes.  She was a cougar.  Colorado wildlife officials say a bear was found feeding on the body of a 73-year-old woman. 
[01:30:30]  Imagine what that tasted like.  Dry.  Who had been repeatedly warned not to give dog food to the Bruins that lived near her home.  Interesting.  She was feeding the bears with dog food.  Dog food.  That's cute.  A caretaker said she saw the bear over the woman's body Friday and called 911.  It was her leftovers.  The Colorado Division of Wildlife spokesman, Joe Whatever, says it's unclear if the bear killed the woman or if she died of other causes.  He says the woman was known to feed bears dog food and would not stop. 
[01:31:00]  Even after repeated requests from wildlife officials, sheriff's deputies investigating the incident killed an aggressive bear at the woman's home.  Stop killing the animal for doing what it's supposed to do.  Exactly.  Dog food in each hand and a trout up her ass.  Right.  Expects the fucking...  Dumb old lady.  Dope.  Yeah.  Bears are known to be aggressive.  Yeah.  Take the bear off the dead woman's body and put it back in the woods.  And let it go.  Exactly.  They had a taste of blood.  She probably thought she could get close to it now that she was feeding it. 
[01:31:30]  And the bear's like, finally, this old bitch gets close enough.  And he clawed her dumb head.  That cotton candy hairdo and her fucking bencher breath.  He was so tired of her face.  Enough with your stupid dog food.  I want the real meat.  He went to get in there and get that computer.  He heard what the cat was doing.  He started downloading.  You think she screamed or just went like, oh my.  Oh, no.  Like some old lady.  Oh.  To know the last thing she was saying.  It's chilly out here.  Oh.  Put on a sweater.  Yeah. 
[01:32:00]  Another old broad story we got, too.  Which one?  That fucking lunatic that drove the wrong way.  Oh, one-way broad.  Another one.  Another one.  On which bridge?  The Tappan Z.  You can't drive the wrong way on the Tappan Z.  That's almost impossible.  Almost.  How the fuck did she do it?  She did it.  How?  She was confused.  But how do you, like, make the U-turn?  I don't know.  I think it was before the bridge.  Right.  She gets on the wrong way and then drives across the bridge.  The cops spot her or someone says something and start chasing her. 
[01:32:30]  And when they finally pull her over, she goes, it was two miles, by the way, she drove.  And she goes, I was looking for a place to make a U-turn.  Why wouldn't you just stop your fucking car immediately?  Yeah.  Pull it over the side as best as you can.  Call the cops.  Have them, you know, fucking block traffic.  Turn you around.  But you know what they did?  They wrote her a few tickets. 
[01:33:00]  And now she has to take some kind of a driver's course.  What?  No.  Take her fucking license away.  They should have thrown her and her car over the side of the bridge.  Yes.  75 years old.  Two miles on the bridge the wrong fucking way.  No one got hurt, though?  No.  No.  Thank God.  Lucky, lucky.  How about all people just get retested?  How about that?  Drove the wrong way on the Tappan Z.  She drove about two miles and then was stopped. 
[01:33:30]  She entered the highway from the exit nine off-ramp.  She told police she knew she had been driving the wrong way, but was going, kept going because  she thought she would find a place to make a U-turn.  She was given tickets and she has to go to a course, some kind of course.  People reach a certain age, they just can't. 
[01:34:00]  They can't do it anymore.  She should be forced to move on to.  I was just going to say, weave in and out of fucking headstones until she falls in the  one that's meant for her.  Stupid poon.  Go fucking feed some bears.  Poon and Peter.  That's a dumb broad right there.  Yeah, 75.  She's driving the wrong way.  It's just time to fucking, sorry.  Your independence is gone.  Put on a diaper.  Get in the home.  And fucking, it's over, Johnny. 
[01:34:30]  Michael Jackson.  Yeah.  Every story, every new story that comes out about this fucking lunatic just proves that  he is, he was just an insane pedophile.  It really does.  Definitely say an insane pedophile.  Yeah.  All right.  That's what I'm saying.  Is Reverend Al still in on this Michael Jackson case?  No.  He disappeared, moved on to something else?  He left.  He moved on.  He's gone. 
[01:35:00]  Didn't he want to get the body up there in Harlem and all that?  Yeah, yeah.  Take him on tour.  Is he buried?  Is Michael Jackson buried?  Burned?  What happened?  Hell no.  What are they doing?  Does anyone know?  They want a Graceland.  They're just trying to figure out where he is.  Yeah, figure out where he should go.  Where it makes sense to do that.  Well, this fucking lunatic.  The godfather of Michael Jackson's kids.  Yeah, the godfather.  Claims he is the father of Paris Jackson because he saw a recent picture of her and went,  holy shit, that's my, looks just like the daughter I have at home here.  And said that Michael had come to him and asked him to be a sperm donor for a child. 
[01:35:30]  And the only reason I can think of that Michael Jackson wanted this guy as a sperm donor.  You know who the guy is, right?  Oh, yes.  He's a child star.  He's a child star.  From England.  It's because Michael was so attracted to this guy when he was a kid.  He wanted his own version.  His own fucking version.  If you watch the original movie, Oliver, he played Oliver Twist in the movie Oliver. 
[01:36:00]  And the little blonde haired kid, please, may I have some more?  I don't know what he looked like.  You'll recognize him if you see him.  Please, sir, I want some more of that famous line with this guy.  That was his little kid.  That gave sperm to Michael Jackson for his kids?  And that is the one that Michael Jackson wanted a carbon copy of.  I'm sure he was fucking disappointed as hell when a girl came out on that one.  Wow, wow, wow.  He wanted a little kid that looked like Oliver from the movie.  All these people are coming forward not because they care about the well-being of the children. 
[01:36:30]  They realize these kids are worth a shitload of money.  Hundreds of millions of dollars.  Yep.  Hundreds of millions of dollars.  That's why they don't give a crap about if they're being taken care of or not.  Sounds like this Katherine Jackson would do the right thing as far as the kids go.  So what's the big deal?  Oh, the one that stays out of the limelight?  Well, the mom.  Primarily.  Oh, that one?  Yeah.  The mom is in charge right now of the kids, right?  Yeah.  But now this guy's like, fuck that, man. 
[01:37:00]  I'm worried.  And Paris looks like my daughter that I have at home.  I don't think it does.  But there it is.  I'm convinced that Michael Jackson did end up using my sperm.  That is Michael Jackson's fucking wet dream right there.  We're looking at a very little picture.  Little Oliver.  A young picture of Oliver, yeah.  What's his name?  What's his name?  What's his name?  What's his name?  I don't know.  Oh, pedo.  That's Mark Lester, I think his name is.  Yeah.  Little Mark Lester is everything Michael Jackson looked for in a molestable child. 
[01:37:30]  The blonde hair, the pouting lips.  The little hat.  The little hat.  The peener.  The peener.  The little peener.  Put it in peener.  Michael wants that peener.  Yeah.  God.  What a creep.  Every fucking story.  Your father was not weird.  It was weird what they did to your father.  What they did to him?  Weird what he had to deal with. 
[01:38:00]  Yeah.  Which is what?  Oh, yeah, yeah.  That's what.  Shut up, Al.  What was it, Al?  Al.  What was it, Al?  He's a pedo, Al.  Does anyone follow up with all the stuff Reverend Al wants to do and realizes it all falls horribly  short?  Once the cameras go away, he faded out of the Michael Jackson situation very quickly after  he got all that exposure.  Last camera packs up, Reverend Al packs up.  That's how it works.  He leaves.  It's over. 
[01:38:30]  That's what he's about.  Oh, I don't know.  I don't want to be negative.  Oh, Jimmy.  Yeah.  Mark Lester.  Does he want the kid?  I think so.  I think that's what he's hinting at.  Boy, he didn't do much after Oliver, huh?  Except, you know, jerk off into a fucking cup.  Well, what else is there to do after Oliver?  Yeah, exactly.  What the fuck, right?  Football started last night. 
[01:39:00]  Jesus Christ.  Already?  Did it?  Yeah, the Hall of Fame game, I guess.  Oh, so it didn't really start.  Well, it's, yeah, you know, it's preseason stuff.  Yeah.  It's an amazing case.  Quadriplegic 49 petitions court to end his life.  Oh, one of these.  He, um, he's, his life's living hell.  And he wants, his name is John Hammond, and he, uh, I think he's in Australia.  And he wants a bedside hearing next Friday.  Oh, I'm sorry, that was the lawyer, Christian Rossiter or whatever. 
[01:39:30]  He's in 24-hour care, and he wants to just be taken off food.  And he wants to die.  Just like that, there's a great movie called Whose Life Is It Anyway?  It's a Richard Dreyfuss movie with John Cassavetes, excuse me, where he plays a sculptor who's paralyzed in a car accident.  And he fights for his right to be taken off life support so he can just go and fade away.  He's in Australia?  This guy, the movie is not.  The movie takes place in Boston, I think, but this guy's in Australia.  See, this guy should book oceanic flight to, um, uh, L.A. 
[01:40:00]  And then when he crashes on the island, he'll probably be fine and be able to walk around and be, um, like a heroic character.  Wouldn't it be funny if they found out Lost was actually Staten Island?  And they were all on Toad Hill Road?  Toad Hill Road!  All they need to do is walk to the Verrazano or the Gothels or the Outer Bridge.  Or the Bayonne Bridge.  Is that in Staten Island or no?  Uh, yeah.  Doesn't that come over?  Yeah, I think it does.  I'm not sure.  You should be able to own your own life, at least. 
[01:40:30]  Yep.  You don't really own much in this world.  You're not allowed to.  You should be able to at least own your own life and decide what you want to do with yourself.  In some countries you can.  Not ours.  Not here, no.  Not ours.  We have freedom to not be as free as we think we are.  Yeah, we have a lot of freedom, don't we?  A lot of freedom.  The freedom of this country is just crazy.  I don't know what to do with all of it.  Such a joke.  You're free to not be free.  Wow.  No, I feel freedom all the time.  Oh my God, it's crazy. 
[01:41:00]  You have to adhere to rules every second of your life.  Right.  You're adhering to rules and regulations that are put on you.  You're supposed to be free.  Right.  But there are things you can't do all the time.  You pretty much can't do anything.  When you leave here, try just walking down the middle of the road instead of the sidewalk.  You'll get a ticket.  You have to walk on the sidewalk.  But I want to walk in the middle of the road.  You can't.  You're not free to do so.  Well, you're not.  I have to play devil's advocate. 
[01:41:30]  Oh, please.  Yeah.  Don't walk in the middle of the road.  But don't swallow.  Don't swallow.  Your exercise and your freedom can't interfere with the safety of others.  And walking in the middle of the road is a safety hazard for other people who are driving.  Okay.  All right.  But you still should be able to do it if you want.  As far as men who want to fuck each other's heinies and then get married, that should be legal. 
[01:42:00]  That should be legal?  Sure should.  Oh, yeah.  That's just a bunch of people forcing their morality down everybody else's fucking throat.  And other things.  Gah!  Gah!  I'd like to introduce you to morality.  Here he is.  Big bubble-butted gentleman in a white t-shirt.  So are they going to let this guy die or what?  I don't know.  You don't know?  No one knows, right?  I certainly hope so.  We'll know after the hearing?  For his sake, I hope so.  Because it's what he wants. 
[01:42:30]  Nah, they won't.  They might.  All he wants to be is taking...  Like, you're feeding somebody against that.  How bad is he?  Is he like...  No, no, no.  He's not like that.  Oh, then if his mind is still working, they ain't going to fucking let him die.  They will not let him fucking die.  Then he should just go to another country.  How is he going to get there?  He's paralyzed.  What is he going to do?  Come on.  Blow into his straw for the next 10 years and hope for the best?  Well...  He's going to blow into his straw.  How the fuck is he getting there, Jim?  He's exhausted.  He's hyperventilating. 
[01:43:00]  He hasn't gone fucking 15 feet.  Oh, and it's Australia to begin with.  All right, where's he going?  It's all the fucking same place.  He's just going to, like, blow his way all the way to the shoreline.  Just blow you away to the coral reef and hope a shark eats you.  That's how I get from place to place.  I blow my way from town to town.  Thanks for the lift.  Yeah.  Who needs bus fare?  Why?  Because.  Why not? 
[01:43:30]  Because he's big and gay.  You guys following any of this Woodstock shit 40 years ago?  What?  40 years ago, what, on the 15th?  Oh, August.  Three days of peace and music, my friend.  I've had more than enough of Woodstock.  I'm sick of hearing about it.  Let it go.  They did a Dateline thing on it last night.  I was hooked.  I watched the whole hour.  Yeah?  Jesus Christ.  Did they show, was it, like, a lot of new clips?  Or did they show naked people?  Ah, they just, they just picked, they picked, they picked more obscure people to really 
[01:44:00]  kind of talk about the Woodstock.  Some priest that came up and, and it changed his whole life where he didn't want to be  a priest anymore.  He was, he's studying to be a priest and met some 17 year old hot thing.  No shit.  And they teased it the whole show.  And I, I turned to my girl, I'm like, they're obviously going to show the wife.  That's going to be the big, the big get at the end of this hour.  And she was a hot, young, fucking hippie.  Oh no.  40 years ago.  And they showed her finally, and she couldn't be more of a beast if you drew it on a piece 
[01:44:30]  of paper.  Wow.  And I'm like, holy shit, was that disappointing.  I thought she'd like, maybe kept herself together in the 40 years.  So when you think 40 years, and if they were, you know, in their teens.  She didn't have a hint of a female body.  Yeah.  And she fat?  She was like, yeah.  She was kind of like, there was no shape to her body.  Short hair, that whole thing.  And they showed him walking away hand in hand where Woodstock, you know, happened 40 years  ago.  Dramatically.  Here's where she blew me.  Right.  But they showed the young wannabe a priest guy. 
[01:45:00]  He's on his old, I think it was an old Harley.  He meets her in traffic and she, you know, jumped on his bike and they hung out for the  three days and love was in the air, man.  Isn't it weird though?  You see somebody in traffic and that's the person you spend the next 40 years with.  Yeah.  They've been married 39 years.  Not only did he say, fuck, fuck being a priest, he, he, he married this, uh, this  girl.  He gave up God.  Quickly.  She was hot like, uh, the old picture is not bad.  Yeah.  Not bad.  She had that nice little young 17 year old body with the long hair and she was enjoying 
[01:45:30]  some, some music, my friend.  God damn.  It's so weird.  We still talk about Woodstock.  It was just a long weekend.  Yeah.  It was just a long concert.  I mean, when you look back, you think that it went on for a month or something.  It was the whole summer.  No, it was just three lousy days.  Three days with a lot of lousy music, by the way.  And a few good, good ones.  But you know, who else?  He's Shauna Na.  Yeah.  They were there.  Shauna Na was there.  It's funny to look at the lineup that was at Woodstock. 
[01:46:00]  There were a few bands.  There was one band I think called The Quill.  Yeah.  Who?  Like most of these bands, you go, oh, okay, Richie Havens.  Oh, Jimi Hendrix.  Oh, Janis Joplin.  Oh, The Who.  They ended up having, you know, tremendous careers long past Woodstock was over.  And then there was a band called, I think, The Quill.  What do we know about The Quill?  Nothing.  During the day.  Is this The Quill?  This is The Quill. 
[01:46:30]  Oh.  That's kind of cool.  Is it?  Yeah, why not?  Jam bandish.  Yeah.  The Quill opened day two, and they did five songs.  This sounds a little like Doyle Hargrave's band.  Stephen, that's for Bayshore.  Today, that hot 17-year-old girl has somehow turned into a slightly thinner fat mat.  Time sucks a fat one. 
[01:47:00]  The dead, of course.  Who headlined that night?  It wasn't even the dead, huh?  Oh, CCR was there.  I didn't realize they were there.  CCR, yeah.  They did 11 songs.  They were like one of the bigger bands.  And, uh...  Sly and the Family Stone, Joplin.  The band.  And The Who headline.  24 songs they did.  Holy shit.  The Who did 24 songs?  Are you shitting me?  And the movie, they show like two songs.  And they don't show all the bands.  They don't like the movies.  I don't remember the movie.  I was thinking I was going to maybe pick that up and watch it again. 
[01:47:30]  Yeah, they don't show enough of, like, what was going on.  I don't know.  Why didn't this band make it?  It's like pretty much any other band that was happening during the era.  This is a second stage act at a festival now.  Probably.  It's just like, eh, who are those guys?  If the boys down the hall could find the Dateline special from last night, they interviewed the lead singer of the band a lot.  I always forget his name.  And he had all sorts of problems with his throat.  I think it was throat cancer and whatnot.  And he survived.  But he now sounds like the pervy neighbor from Family Guy. 
[01:48:00]  Oh, really?  So if you guys could get a sample of him talking from last night.  He whistles.  He whistles as he talks.  Oh, I thought he, like, whistled professionally like Steve the Whistler.  Oh, no, no, there's kind of a whistling that happens because he's talking through, I guess, fake teeth or something.  So kind of a lot of air escapes when he talks.  Yeah.  Let's see.  Here's the canceled act.  This is pretty interesting.  The Jeff Beck Group.  Cancelled?  Yeah.  The band broke up in July, forcing cancellation.  Iron Butterfly. 
[01:48:30]  Hold on.  That was a smart move, huh?  Yeah.  Miss Woodstock.  Iron Butterfly.  They get stuck at the airport.  Their manager demanded helicopters and special arrangements.  Yeah.  They were told, they were wired back as impolitely as Western Union were allowed to get lost.  But in other words, Joni Mitchell, her agent, put her on the Dick Cavett show.  Instead?  Yeah.  Another fucking dummy who thinks that just the only thing that matters is a TV appearance.  And Lighthouse, who I don't know who they were.  And...  Fucking better love Lighthouse.  Ethan Brown.  Who's that?  I don't know. 
[01:49:00]  Lighthouses.  Lighthouses.  That's pretty cool.  And you know what?  I think a lot of people forget, but Janis Joplin and Jimi Hendrix, it was pointed out during  the Dateline thing, they were dead a year later.  Yeah.  I mean, you don't really think about that.  You think Woodstock, holy shit, and then they were both dead by 1970.  Done.  It was day one, Danny.  Did you see day one?  Because day two, the headline, it was like, it was like Sly and the Family Stone, then Joplin,  then The Who.  And then the third day, it was like the TCR. 
[01:49:30]  What a fucking lineup, man.  This was a pretty amazing lineup.  But who actually saw it?  Like, did you ever see the fucking, the crowd?  Right.  Like, they didn't have big TVs set up so you could see it from the back.  Melody did two songs.  Oh.  Did she do roller skates?  No.  She didn't do roller skate?  Mm-mm.  Joan Baez.  Yeah, Joan Baez did some fucking folky shit.  Okay.  Dedicated it to our husband who was in prison on a hunger strike, by the way.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  Why? 
[01:50:00]  Man!  I hate hunger strike.  I don't know why.  It's just, man.  Yeah, I think most of the people that say they were there weren't there.  Or if they were there, they were way too far away to hear anything.  I was there.  If someone looks at the moment, you look in hindsight.  Right.  So it was like, oh, I was there.  No, you weren't.  I was there.  My mother actually wanted me to see.  I was just a boy, so she actually got on her hands and knees and just opened her back.  I was trying to make it see. 
[01:50:30]  Jesus, Jimmy.  Took a peek out.  It was so odd because I was a year old.  Like a kangaroo.  Kangaroo.  Yeah.  Like a little pouch.  And then that Jimi Hendrix improv with the fucking Star Spangled Banner, man.  One of the Hendrix guys was talking during the special last night saying, yeah, that wasn't planned.  Really?  That he was just going to completely just redo the Star Spangled Banner like he did.  And he played like at the end of the fucking thing. 
[01:51:00]  Live on hell.  Oh, yeah.  I mean, half the people were gone.  Everyone was gone, yeah.  Yeah, they showed it last night.  Garbage all over the place?  Yeah, it was very sparse.  But they talk about it like this thing went on for a month.  It was three lousy days.  Yeah, like they set up camp for the summer.  Yeah.  Like they set up some kind of soup kitchen to try to feed people because they were running out of food and no one knew where to shit.  And people were bathing nude everywhere.  In the big lake, that mud pit.  That rocks.  With the naked, hairy people. 
[01:51:30]  It just shows you how much things just suck.  You couldn't get a Woodstock thing going today.  I know they've tried the fake Woodstock, but one of these things where it just all comes together like that.  Because permits and all sorts of shit, it would just never happen again like that.  The new Woodstock, man, is all corporate.  Yeah.  Bottle of water, 10 bucks.  I performed at Woodstock 94.  I know you did.  But it wasn't like Woodstock. 
[01:52:00]  It was, O.P.  It was the same thing.  I mean, that's a great gig for you, but.  That sucked.  You can't even compare the two.  It was awful.  I can't believe that's 15 fucking years ago.  15 years ago.  Oh, wow.  With Levy.  Levy was doing coke off his license.  We're laying in the tent.  I told you we kept running over because we were in a tent with these other performers.  And these African band, the one African guy, his big fucking dick with bulge in his pants.  And we would all point at it and laugh in the morning.  Literally, he had to have fucking nine soft. 
[01:52:30]  And I was with Florentine and Don Jameson.  And fucking.  Nine soft.  And Levy wanted to talk at three in the morning.  He's doing blow off his license.  Oh, shit.  Wow.  Yeah, this is the.  Is this from the Woodstock version?  Wow.  Who was the big get for Woodstock?  I think it was the Who.  Santana was pretty big at the time, but the Who was like.  Joplin was big, right?  I mean, Tommy had just come out.  Have you ever been up there to check out where Woodstock happened? 
[01:53:00]  No.  I kind of have the urge to do that.  I've been to Woodstock, New York.  It's nice.  But it wasn't in Woodstock, New York.  That's the trivia question, Jimmy.  It wasn't in Woodstock, New York.  How far was it from there?  Where was it?  Bethel?  3,000 miles.  Oh, boy.  Yes.  Was it Bethel?  It was in Los Angeles.  Yeah.  Bethel, New York?  Next town over, I guess?  Yeah.  It was supposed to be in Woodstock, and then something fell apart.  What was his name?  Yager?  Yager?  Yager?  Yager.  Yager, that's right.  Yager's farm.  What was he thinking to rent out his farm to a half million people? 
[01:53:30]  He was a dumb hillbilly motherfucker.  How much money did he get?  I bet you it was like 10 grand, some dumb number, I bet you.  Well, they had to stop honoring tickets.  So then people just came in for free.  It was free.  Well, what was the big announcement?  From now on, it's a free concert, man!  Like, they had some chain link fences, but people were just cutting through them or walking  over them, and no tickets.  Fuck it.  No ticket.  Music should be free, man! 
[01:54:00]  Now I'm just going to grab some bitch and have her give me a blowjob, and she won't  care.  They did a little piece on the trip tents last night on Dateline.  I keep saying Dateline.  I hope I'm giving them credit.  Where if you were having a bad trip, this woman understood a bad trip, so she had tents  set up so you could come in and enjoy the rest of your trip.  Your trip, man!  They were called trip...  Not trip tents.  Trip...  Uh, teepees. 
[01:54:30]  Teepees, man.  Yeah, she set up teepees so you could go inside and enjoy the rest of your trip, man.  Because you'd freak out.  You look at that many people tripping.  I'm lost, man.  And how great is it?  They said the traffic was so horrific.  Just imagine trying to do this today.  This is the only reason I'm bringing it up.  Traffic was so horrific, people said, fuck it, and just started parking anywhere they wanted,  and then would walk the rest to the venue.  They would stop their car on the thruway.  Would that happen today without your car just being towed and ticketed? 
[01:55:00]  They'd take bulldozers now and just push them off the road.  If you block the fucking New York State thruway...  I'd be fucking beeping.  There was no easy pass.  Yeah.  God, that would suck.  Let me say hi to Carney.  Carney.  What's up, guys?  Hey, Carney.  I think someone was saying that somebody said that Pete Townsend during Woodstock,  it was like Abby Hopkins or something, said,  you know, when they looked out over the crowd, they said, look at it, it's a teenage wasteland. 
[01:55:30]  And that's how they came up with the term, teenage wasteland, from Bob O'Reilly.  But why Bob O'Reilly?  That song really should just be called Teenage Wasteland.  Make it easy for everybody.  Just to bring it all around again, you know?  You know what?  I never knew that.  Is that really where that song came from?  Yeah.  Where that part of the song?  Yeah.  I mean, the whole thing was Mayor Baba and that's where Baba came from and something like  that.  But the actual Teenage Wasteland part of the song came from someone saying that Pete Townsend.  Huh.  Very cool.  Thank you, sir.  Let's go to Bam in Florida. 
[01:56:00]  Bam.  What's up, fellas?  Hey, man.  Hey, man.  You guys have seen the preview.  There's a Woodstock movie coming out.  It looks real douchey and queer.  It's got Demetri Martin, the kind of fruitcake comedian.  He has got his own show on Comedy Central and shit.  But it just looks absolutely putrid.  Awful.  It's like a, it's not a documentary, right?  No, no.  It's not a documentary.  It's kind of like a look back and how everything came together and how everything fell apart 
[01:56:30]  all at the same time.  You know why that movie isn't going to work?  I saw the preview, too.  It looks too pretty.  Yeah, yeah.  Woodstock, people were just covered in mud and shit.  It was nasty.  Because there was nowhere to shit.  So when it rained, I think it was the second day, the mud and the shit combined everywhere.  Because people were just dumping wherever the fuck they could.  Punch it out, fellas.  Happy birthday, Jimmy.  Thank you.  But they all, like in the preview, they have all very colorful tie-dyes on it.  Everything's too nice and bright and clean. 
[01:57:00]  Yeah, it doesn't have that look.  No.  Let's go to Steve in New York.  Steve.  Hey, good morning, boys.  By the way, good job by Travis just keeping the Woodstock music going.  I like this.  I like that.  Steve, what do you got?  Yeah, one of the biggest impacts besides just a three-day concert,  my brother and my brother-in-law were there.  My brother just got back from Nam, and he went up there.  And I wound up living about eight miles away from the site.  And it just closed downtown for like 30-mile radius.  I mean, just small little country back roads. 
[01:57:30]  It was just hippies everywhere.  And they just shut down, you know, everything.  But see, that's the theme of this conversation.  They shut down traffic for 30.  It was a long weekend.  For how long?  It was three days.  The hell they shut down traffic?  I guess they went and got their cars.  Probably like maybe five total days.  A day before, maybe a day after.  It was a nightmare, too, I'm sure.  Yeah, the locals told me it took like a week to get all the cars  and the hippies and everything, you know, out of there 
[01:58:00]  so they could get back to some kind of life.  And how many of them stayed and just made Woodstock?  I know.  We're not going to leave, man.  Man.  This is going to be our new place, man.  We want the magic that's here.  Get the fuck out.  I think there were some people that wanted to, like.  A lot of people stayed.  Stay there, yeah.  Not a lot.  I mean, a good amount.  We stayed on the farm or in Woodstock, New York.  But I love how people bitch, yeah, and it took so long to get them out.  Yeah, but then now you're known in history.  Yeah.  Now you got all sorts of business coming in.  You know, they're making a lot of money on the tourist dollar. 
[01:58:30]  Let me go to Flounder in Jersey.  Flounder.  What's up, guys?  Hey.  Woodstock, New York, the town itself.  If I go every summer, we go up there for a reunion.  Why?  Not like a family reunion, but they're not, like, all hippies.  But the town of Woodstock is all people.  All people what?  Oh, my God.  You wouldn't go there, Ash?  All people what?  Ant, you wouldn't go to Woodstock?  Why?  No. 
[01:59:00]  Why wouldn't you?  Oh, fuck.  A nice bed and breakfast?  Yeah.  A little bed and breakfast.  I'm on room service and TV cable.  I know.  Me too.  You get to have breakfast with other couples from around the country.  It's nice.  Fuck that.  And they have a little tea hour in it.  No.  You would enjoy the tea hour.  I'd hate that.  And then they have little board games where you might play a little board game with somebody else.  Board being the definitive word.  I hate things like that.  I'm not going to go look at nature, like, fucking take a little tour of where a bunch of people stood 40 years ago. 
[01:59:30]  That doesn't.  I love going to places where cool things happen.  I like that, too.  But that was like, and here's where people stood.  That's not like going to Dealey Plaza or something, you know?  Right.  That's kind of very cool.  This is just.  When you go to Dealey Plaza, you feel like you're on a movie set.  It's so bizarre because you've seen it so many times on TV.  When you're there, it just looks like a movie set.  You're familiar with everything.  It's all facades and shit.  Yeah.  Yeah. 
[02:00:00]  You forget that.  They're still trying to do business in that area.  The only time I went and, like, was looking at nature, I went out to, like, what is it?  Arches National Park out in Utah, I think it is.  Yeah, that shit's cool.  And they filmed, like, you know, some Indiana Jones movies.  They film a lot of fucking movies out there.  And that was really cool.  You know, you get those things that just come out of the fucking ground with a boulder sitting on top of it. 
[02:00:30]  It doesn't make sense.  Been there for a million years.  What the fuck's that?  It's pretty cool.  Yeah, keep thinking your life's important.  Oh, I know.  You go out there and look around, and you're just like, ah.  This life doesn't mean shit, so just go raping.  I'm a speck here for two seconds.  Yeah.  Fucking Mayflies.  Other bands that weren't.  Wait.  The best bands never even made it.  These bands were invited but never showed? 
[02:01:00]  I'm guessing the Stones were invited.  Or they declined invitations.  You got The Doors.  Foundry.  Foundry said no.  Rotgut.  Rotgut said no.  Yeah.  The Doors.  The Doors said no.  Zeppelin said no.  Jethro Tull said no.  The Byrd said no.  And Bob Dylan's kid was sick.  You think Bob Dylan's holding a grudge on that one?  Yeah.  I'm a little angry.  I miss the big jam.  His son had the flu shit. 
[02:01:30]  Yeah.  That's why he wasn't performing in front of a half million people live.  To be remembered for the rest of history.  Where was Clapton?  Clapton you think should have been there?  Yeah.  Where was Clapton?  One of his bands.  Who was he in back then?  Cream or something?  Whitebirds.  Could have been.  I don't know.  It could have been.  Yeah.  Matt.  North Carolina.  What's up, boys?  Hey.  Hey.  Going back to last week.  Can you imagine all the dirty shitters that were in that crowd? 
[02:02:00]  Well, in the actual movie, Woodstock, they do show the guy that comes in to suck out the portable,  Porto Sand portable toilets.  They interviewed him in the movie.  And he's just sucking shit out of these things.  That was his job?  He goes, and then I wipe it down.  He goes, you got to keep it clean for the kids.  Like, it's just some old guy doing his job.  Back then, they didn't understand that you might need a few Porta Potties. 
[02:02:30]  Oh, suck.  Back then, it was like, get me 10.  Just sucking hashish dumps out of the fucking portable toilets.  Now, if you go to some outdoor event, there's plenty of Porta Potties.  Back then, they just didn't believe in it.  No.  It's an aff, fuck it.  Half these people will shit in the woods.  People did.  They shit everywhere.  They shit in the middle.  They couldn't even make it to the way.  When you see that shot from the helicopter of all the people, and imagine being in the 
[02:03:00]  middle of that crowd and having to take a dump.  You're not making it out of that fucking crowd.  You got to squat and shit in the middle of the fucking crowd.  It was giant.  The other thing they mentioned during the Dateline thing last night was some Jewish woman  made 100 peanut butter and jelly sandwiches, and she's known as the lady that made 100  peanut butter and jelly sandwiches.  Doesn't feed shit.  Thank you.  What the fuck is that?  Like, she's some kind of, like, hippie hero.  I'm like, you made 100 lousy sandwiches.  Exactly.  What the fuck do you want from us?  You shouldn't be remembered for all time because you made 100 sandwiches. 
[02:03:30]  There was, uh, they showed also the, uh, uh, people that didn't mind the young kids there  and then people that hated it.  Yeah.  Like, some people were like, yeah, they come here, so we gave them some food and stuff.  And then another guy, crotchety guy, was like, they come here and shit on your lawn?  I think it's disgusting.  I can't wait till they're gone.  But, I mean.  But you piece, Nick.  You would be that guy, though.  I don't think you'd want, like, hippies shitting on your lawn.  Why are you?  I'd be shaking my fist. 
[02:04:00]  And he's probably the guy that needed the perfect lawn in the, in that town.  Oh, yeah.  And now you got hippies just squatting and taking fucking.  Oh, probably got three kids in the NOM.  Hated these peace hippie motherfuckers.  Squatting and taking mescaline dumps on your lawn.  Big, giant, fucking Schaefer-Rangold dumps.  Oh, this is very important.  I didn't know this.  Alex, you got something on Woodstock?  Woodstock.  Alex.  Yeah, apparently on that Dateline special, there was a young girl in the audience by the name, 
[02:04:30]  I think it was Abigail, who was being pushed into a codeine overdose.  Oh, my God.  Did she have to go into the teepee, the teepee trip tent or whatever?  I thought they were in a teepee.  Finally, he finds out.  Could you see stupid Jimsy trying to get the Woodstock bands to stop?  Quincy.  People, people.  Well, Quincy.  I call him Jimsy now.  Yes, it is Jimsy. 
[02:05:00]  I'm the coroner from Woodstock.  But there was only one death in Woodstock there, Jimsy.  There really is?  I think so.  It's like a half a million people in the crowd.  Could I have everyone's attention?  Yes.  There's a young girl, Abigail.  Her armpit hair is being grown, so it strangles her.  Abigail.  Stupid Abigail.  What did he say?  You're the one?  You're the killer.  Yeah.  The whole sick society.  Society.  Society. 
[02:05:30]  Where the escape go?  You and your whole sick society.  Yes, this is live Janis Joplin.  No, it's not.  It's Jefferson Airplane.  It's Jefferson.  No.  Somebody says, what's the background music?  Janis?  Yeah, it's Airplane.  No, it's Jefferson Airplane.  Whatever the fuck they called themselves back then.  They were always changing their name.  It was Jefferson Airplane, and then it was just Airplane.  And then it was Jefferson Starship. 
[02:06:00]  Starship.  Starship.  And then it was just Starship.  And then they went to Jefferson.  Then they were the regulars, and then the new regulars.  And then we went back to Spino Tap.  You think we're all zombie killers?  Zombie killers.  Good dialogue.  You're the killers.  You're a whole sick society.  That's who's guilty, man.  We're just your lousy escape goat.  Escape goat?  The worst punk concert ever.  Oh, it wasn't a punk concert.  I love the awful music, and then they all just stop and listen to the coroner and the  member's only coat. 
[02:06:30]  And slacks.  Who is this asshole?  Slacks.  I'm involved in a car chase again.  What the fuck are they doing?  Get back to your house of horrors and chop people up.  Somebody's pointing out that the lawns in the area must look good to this day from all  the human manure.  Fertilizer.  All the fertilizer the hippies left behind.  Oh, this is a very good question.  Let's go to this guy in North Carolina.  This guy in North Carolina.  Hello, sir.  What's up, man? 
[02:07:00]  Hey, I wonder how many people thought their hot dogs were talking to them.  Yeah, no kidding.  The hot dog trip.  And we thought we'd go downtown and get a hot dog.  All of a sudden, it had a face.  That's so stupid.  Dave in New York.  Dave.  Hey, how you doing?  I was calling to let you know that every year in Tennessee, they have that Tennessee  jam.  That draws several thousand people.  Yeah, but several thousand sucks.  It was a half a million strong. 
[02:07:30]  Yeah.  Bonnaroo was pretty big.  Well, I wasn't there to see how many it was.  Also, too, that Burning Man festival, that draws a bunch of people, too.  Burning Man is, like, fucking crazy.  I don't know.  It's out in the desert, right?  And they set up a big thing and burn it, and then they're naked and fucking...  Yeah, they're doing a pretty good job trying to keep it going.  That's a little weird, that whole thing.  I'm pushing out while I can.  Wiccan fucking shit thing.  I don't know what it is.  Hey, dude, it's not gay if you're tripping.  I had a boil open. 
[02:08:00]  Really?  Thank you, sir.  Are those the rules?  I hope so.  It's in the handbook.  I hope so.  Pat from Menock, he writes,  Gypsy made the announcement about the bad brown acid.  Oh, yeah.  Don't eat the brown acid.  There's a girl named Abigail.  They've been feeding her brown acid.  It's very bad.  Don't eat it.  Who the fuck brought in the brown acid?  Yeah, someone's famous.  That was my acid.  Some of the undesirables brought in some bad drugs. 
[02:08:30]  Gypsy made the announcement.  I was stalling because I want to hear the dude from the band  talking like, you know, the neighbor pervert from Family Guy.  Oh, yeah.  We were supposed to get back to the band.  Maybe after the break we'll have that.  Hopefully.  Is this Joe Cocker?  Oh, yeah.  You can hear that.  Yeah.  CCR.  What a great lineup.  Yeah.  It's groundbreaking, Jim.  Great lineup at Woodstock.  But then you had to sit through some shit.  Play a little the band The Weight going into break. 
[02:09:00]  Oh, yeah?  We don't have to play the whole song.  Just to give us a little taste as we go to break, Travis.  Were they there?  They certainly were.  They were a local band, too.  I did not know that.  And not on the movie at all.  The band isn't?  Not in the movie, no.  Really?  That's why so many of the bands were not in the movie.  Why is that?  Weird.  I don't know.  Maybe they didn't sign off on it.  That was smart on their part.  Maybe.  I'm not sure.  Run out of film?  Film?  All right.  We'll take a break.  We'll take leaks and stuff.  Wee-wee. 
[02:09:30]  Woodstock, 40 years ago, coming up at the end of the week.  40 years.  This ain't-  What are they going to do to celebrate it?  Yeah.  Well, they always have some stupid-  Well, now they got like a-  Well, now they got like a-  Now they got like a concert venue on the site or something.  Do they?  Yeah.  Like, you know.  Richie Havens ever show up there?  I'm sure that's-  Freedom!  People just go, man, this is just like being at Woodstock.  Hello?  Is anyone around me?  Hello?  Hello?  Hey, if you're going to be a one-hit wonder, though, might as well do it at Woodstock.  Holy shit.  Freedom! 
[02:10:00]  I'm sure people will defend Richie Havens, but come on.  One-hit wonder.  Name five Richie Havens songs.  I dare you.  Freedom.  Freedom.  Good.  Sometimes I feel like I'm a motherless child.  Wasn't that Freedom?  I don't know.  Yeah, it was.  I think that's just-  I can't open my fucking orbit gum!  Relax, Jimmy.  Relax.  20 minutes have been fucking-  I see that.  Fabulous!  The packaging on stuff is just a nightmare.  It's gotten more and more ridiculous.  How many people have had to go to the emergency room because they have a major fucking slice 
[02:10:30]  from opening those plastic-  The welded plastic that any little appliance thing or electronic device comes in.  And that's supposed to be for safety, but you end up just slicing the fuck out of your  hands or arms.  You can cut yourself so bad.  You could kill yourself with that.  Because most people don't have, like, scissors readily available when you want to use this  device.  No, we all try to tear it apart.  You put a pen in it or something and then rip and then-  And then get your finger in there and chop your finger off.  Yeah, yeah.  They ain't doing us any favors.  No. 
[02:11:00]  Oh, you got it?  Yeah, finally.  Look at it.  It looks like fucking the bear ate that.  Yeah, dude.  What's up?  I don't know.  It won't open!  Look at your stupid pack of gum is all chewed up now.  Finally opened.  You just want a piece of gum, right?  And Jimmy smells it like-  I love it.  It smells bubblegum-y.  None for anyone but me.  He's greedy.  I can't remember anything else from the Dateline Woodstock thing.  Peanut butter and jelly lady.  The teepee to trip. 
[02:11:30]  The priest that marries the broad.  Mm-hmm.  Still together 39 years later.  God bless.  God bless is right.  God bless.  Good for you.  All right.  Opie and Anthony.  I pulled into Nazareth.  I was feeling about half past day. 
[02:12:00]  I just need to find some place where I can lay my head.  Hey, mister, can you tell me where the man I found, baby?  Well, he just ran and shook my hand.  And no one's all he said.  Take a load of plenty.  Take a load for free.  Take a load of plenty. 
[02:12:30]  And you put the load right on me.  No, it's Poon and Peter in the morning.  Yes.  Kenny was giving me a thumb massage.  I saw that.  My right hand is so sore.  Aw.  I'm hitting the gym, of course.  You can look at me and obviously know that.  But I was all this twittering and shit and typing.  And texting is getting your thumb.  You type with your right thumb. 
[02:13:00]  I used my pointer finger.  I do, too.  I remember.  Yeah.  You've got to hold the phone and then use your pointer finger.  It all depends on what you're doing.  If you're driving, then you've got to use your thumb.  I'm usually jerking.  You're not supposed to text and drive, though.  How about text and jerk?  Very damn.  Yeah, that's tough, too.  Everyone is texting as they drive.  Oh, come on.  Blow them up.  Is this some good...  I want to see some good Afghanistan footage.  That's from one of the Predator drones. 
[02:13:30]  Drug watch along the border, yeah.  Eye in the sky.  It really is amazing that these guys just sit at a base thousands of miles away and fly  these fucking Predator drones.  They have this new army commercial that shows these guys just sitting in this control room.  Yeah.  And it just looks like they're playing video games, and it's like real war, and it almost  makes you...  Yeah, like, look at this.  There's the joystick.  Yeah, I want to play that.  And the guys flying a fucking plane that is equipped with cameras, bombs, missiles. 
[02:14:00]  They take people out with these fucking things.  I'll be in that army.  I don't want to be, you know...  Yeah, that's the easy army.  That's the one where you're just like...  Running with a bayonet on my rifle.  I don't want to be in that army.  You could just be like, hey, Bob, could you take this for me?  I gotta go take a piss.  Yeah, chilling in the comfy chair while I kill people.  Yeah.  That's awesome.  You just sit there and kind of, you know, fly the fucking plane.  And you fly it from the States.  Like, they have places in Nevada and stuff.  And that's where they're flying these fucking things from. 
[02:14:30]  I sat in the drone control stuff when I was over in Iraq.  No, you didn't.  In the control center?  They do what they call wipe it clean.  So there's no information on that.  It's classified.  But yeah, it's a control center.  There's photos of us in the seats.  And we stood next to a drone.  They're pretty, you know...  Yeah, they're pretty big.  Yeah.  It's so impressive.  But they're using...  It is a little...  There's a couple of frightening things going on these days if you're one of those man people.  Yeah.  There's a lot of these drones being used now over the United States.  For what reason? 
[02:15:00]  Border patrol.  But they're also looking for just what else they could use them for.  They're not quite sure.  But they're flying over and they're looking.  They're seeing what they can see and seeing if there's any law enforcement value.  They'll keep us safer.  That's all.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Well, that's exactly it.  Yeah.  Another thing that got me a little...  It was a little off.  Apparently, there's...  I got a lot of attention on Drudge and a couple of websites that Obama... 
[02:15:30]  was giving a speech a few years ago before he was president saying how his health care plan is eventually going to just eliminate the ability to get a private insurance company if you're an American citizen.  Was that like five years ago, six years ago?  Yeah.  And more recently, too.  I think he said that before the election.  And a guy put together a little web montage of him giving speeches. 
[02:16:00]  And the White House actually addressed it with this new thing they have.  It's almost like a minister of information.  And she says, I can't remember her name, but she's a reporter, used to be on Channel 2.  Now she's part of the many reporters that are on Obama's team now.  And she's saying, well, we don't want the spread of misinformation.  So we're putting out our own website that has all the information on it so people can go there and see what's really happening. 
[02:16:30]  Now to me, it's like, well, that's just your side.  Right.  Now, obviously, the people that are putting shit online on their own websites and stuff aren't always right.  But you know something?  I did watch video clips.  And I did hear Obama talking about no privatized insurance in 15, 20 years, he said.  I got one of those from 2003.  Okay.  Let's quick.  I happen to be a proponent of a single-payer universal health care price. 
[02:17:00]  The United States of America, the wealthiest country in the history of the world, spending 14 percent, 14 percent of its gross national product on health care, cannot provide basic health insurance to everybody.  And that's what Jim's talking about when he says everybody in, nobody out.  A single-payer health care plan, universal health care plan. 
[02:17:30]  That's what I'd like to see.  See, single-payer, that's the catchphrase of you're not going to be able to then go to, you know, Oxford or something and say, okay, I can pay the giant premiums, but I'm going to get everything covered.  And I'm not going to have somebody deciding, this is another thing people are scared of, deciding life or death issues based on how productive they feel you're going to be to society.  And the more they say that won't happen, it's just, it has to happen. 
[02:18:00]  That whole plan has to have that, somebody has to be in charge that says, this procedure, you're not worth it.  You're not worth getting a new liver because you're, you know, you're too fucked up, you're too far along, you're dead.  Sorry.  And meanwhile, no matter how much money you have, no matter what connections you have, you're just done. 
[02:18:30]  I don't think that's what...  Why'd you pick liver, by the way?  Well, you know, it's a little tender today after the weekend.  Any part you could have picked, you picked liver.  I don't know why.  It's just a natural thing.  But it's just like, it seems to me that there has to be some kind of, and he's, Obama's the king of appointing czars of things.  I'm sure there'll be a survival czar that will go around and tell you if you're worthy of life-saving medicine and things like that. 
[02:19:00]  But getting back to the whole information thing, so this woman is now in charge of the Internet portion of information that comes in and goes out.  So she saw this montage of actual Obama clips from his speeches like that, where he talks about single payer and no insurance companies, just things like that.  And combat it, she combats it with her own propaganda, is what it is. 
[02:19:30]  But the scary part was, there was something on the website, and she made an announcement that said,  if you see anything out there that is negative, or something you think isn't honest about Obama's healthcare plan,  please email us with that information and links, so they can then, you know, take care of it.  Now that, to me, is completely fucked on any level.  I think that's just, honestly, I think that's a smart thing. 
[02:20:00]  Like, we will put our information up that combats the bullshit, because there's so many ways with bloggers and all this stuff.  You know something? That's fine.  Putting your information up.  They're putting up their own bullshit, though.  So listening, to have people rat out other people's opinions and websites, and even misinformation.  But to have people, to say, give us that link, because they'll go in and shut it down.  And that isn't a cease and desist.  That isn't an infringement on a copyright or anything.  That's people's opinions.  That's people's opposing opinion using research. 
[02:20:30]  Because some of them are educated.  But they want everything that is negative reported to them, so they can then do something about it.  What are they going to do?  Eliminate the website?  They do have the power to do that.  They're fucking White House.  But to me, that is fucking censorship.  Amazing censorship.  And it's right out in the open.  It's not even covert.  That's overt.  Rat this guy out.  That's fucking tactics. 
[02:21:00]  And I don't want to have to go back to those guys.  But taxes that we used by the communists, the Stassi, the fucking Nazis, used the, hey, rat out your neighbor for me, and maybe there'll be something in it for you.  It's just, that to me got really shaky when I heard that.  They'll just get rid of bad clips.  Go, hey, you don't own that clip.  You have no, you're not allowed to have that on your website.  Yeah.  Or who knows what the fuck they'll do.  That's all bullshit, man. 
[02:21:30]  But this is the, again, the Obama, the transparency of his administration, the honesty and openness, the new regime, the change.  And you know what?  It's just more of the same bullshit that if it was Bush and the Republicans doing it, the Democrats would jump all.  Could you see Bush saying, look, or Bush's press secretary, saying, any anti-war stuff out there, I'd really like you to report it to the White House so we could, you know, look into it. 
[02:22:00]  Holy shit, the Democrats would lose their fucking minds over that.  But, eh, they get like a free pass on things like this.  You do.  But it works both ways, don't you think?  But you get more criticism.  As soon as we get a Republican president there, it'll be the same game.  But they're not getting the criticism that they should be getting for this type of censorship.  This is turn someone in for what they are printing on a free forum type censorship. 
[02:22:30]  It is.  Hey, turn this guy in.  We don't like what he's saying about something we want to implement, and it's hurting our chances to get it passed.  Please report it to us so we can eliminate it in some way, shape, or form.  Thank you.  Put a little pressure on that.  That's fucked.  Put a little pressure on the little guy.  Hold on.  This guy wants to counter you.  Howard in Miami.  I'm in Miami. 
[02:23:00]  When are you coming back to work, Howard?  Yeah, yeah.  Anthony, you know, you raved about how the deficit meant nothing when Bush was in the White House.  And now it means everything.  You know, and I agree.  I think the deficit sucks.  But it's just incredible to me that when Bush was in the White House, you went on and on about the deficit means nothing.  I said the deficit is this magical number that you can't even fathom, and it's not made up of real money.  And it still is.  It still is.  You never worried about it when Bush was in office. 
[02:23:30]  You know why?  Yep.  Why?  Because I wasn't fucking paying for it at the rate I am now.  And what about the fucking eight jets that Congress now wants to fucking buy?  Yeah, it's horseshit.  For $550 million that we don't have.  Just keep chalking it up.  Just keep chalking it up.  I agree on that point. 
[02:24:00]  But about the health care issue, I mean, there's so much bull crap, even all the way from Sarah Palin twittering that they want to kill her little retarded baby.  Oh, I know.  Yeah.  I mean, it's absurd, and why shouldn't he want to counter that bullshit?  Well, you know what, though?  Some of it is countering legitimate points.  Anything against this health care thing is bullshit to them.  You don't think that if the government was in charge of our health care, that there'd be somebody or a group of people, a consortium, that would dictate who lives and dies based on... 
[02:24:30]  Now, how?  How would it not get to that?  Every single person, no matter how terminal their disease, would get the best health care right up until they drop dead?  Bullshit!  What the hell do you think happens now?  Right.  Now, let me tell you, let me tell you what happens now.  I'll tell you what happens now.  The poor die.  The wealthy live a little longer, and then they die of the same disease in a nice room with a nurse attending them, changing their bedpans. 
[02:25:00]  You know why?  Because that's the way the country works!  No.  Yes!  The health care, as long as you can continue to pay these ridiculous premiums on your health care...  Exactly.  ...they continue to rise every frickin' month...  You're right, they do.  And so who the hell's gonna put a stop to it?  Mm-hmm.  Yep.  Put a stop to it.  I mean, certain companies run this goddamn country.  You know who's gonna put a stop?  You honestly think that everyone is gonna get health care, no matter how bad the disease. 
[02:25:30]  There's not gonna be this fucking assessment, this triage that goes on before they shell money out, government money out, based on your illness?  Do you honestly think that?  What about the triage that goes on now with the insurance companies?  Yeah.  Shut up!  If they allow this and they don't allow that?  I mean, are you kidding me?  You really think it's a great...  It depends. 
[02:26:00]  ...that we have that?  Hey, my friend, it all depends on what insurance company you have.  Geico.  And what premiums you're paying?  That's what this country's about.  About $1,500 a month.  Yep.  It's a lot of money.  And it sucks.  It's a lot of fucking money.  Sure is.  You don't think your taxes...  I mean, I don't know what tax bracket you're in.  You're apparently in a higher tax bracket than I am.  Yep.  Oh, boy.  Thank goodness.  But, I mean, I look at it as... 
[02:26:30]  I definitely don't think I'm gonna pay $18,000 more in tax...  Hey, let me be honest with you.  I'll be honest with you.  I think with a government health plan, I would pay less in taxes than I pay in premiums for my insurance.  Right.  Exactly.  Yeah, I would pay less.  But you know what?  I don't want to!  I want fucking good health care!  I want good health care!  And since I achieved the American dream and can afford it, I want it!  I don't want this fucker telling me I can't get it!  Yeah, but do you realize the American dream you achieved is only achieved by maybe 1% of the... 
[02:27:00]  Sorry, motherfuckers!  Jesus, Ant.  I mean, so you...  Sorry!  You goddamn king!  You're not the only one in the world, though.  Come on, Ant.  No, I'm not the only one in the world, but it's not my job in this country to fucking pay for everybody else's shit!  Yeah, we do pay for other people's shit.  I fucking pay for everyone's shit!  Because I got lucky!  Because I got lucky and I'm talented because I'm talented!  I'm a freaking contractor that works 10 hours a day. 
[02:27:30]  Ah, you fucking mob front!  You've been in an air-conditioned building for 4 or 5 hours, and you make tons of money.  It's true.  Yes, I do!  But no good for you!  All right, thank you.  You need a tin knocker?  Yeah, no, I'm not a tin knocker.  I'm actually a roofing contractor.  Oh, all right.  You go through a lot of sneakers, don't you?  A lot of boots, actually.  Sure, sure, sure.  All right, my friend, get up on a roof today, you motherfuckers.  It's going to be 90.  No, it's hotter than shit, trust me.  That's right. 
[02:28:00]  Put some tar on the roof and then lay shirtless in it.  Get a tan.  Big fucking can of Karnak.  I'll pour a can of Karnak over your head.  Roll over some fucking bees.  Oh, so you know Karnak.  All right.  Of course, I had to put in curbs and fucking tar paper, those things.  I worked like a goddamn my whole life!  Yeah, but so...  With no health insurance!  I've been working my whole life and I can't get a radio gig, so I'm supposed to suffer?  How old are you?  I'm 52.  All right, you probably won't get a radio gig. 
[02:28:30]  I don't think so.  It was in his 30s when he finally got health insurance.  Yes!  I didn't have any health insurance.  Until you were in your 30s, right?  I didn't have a pot to piss in or a window to throw it out of, my friend.  Jimmy, would it be really, really bad to lay on a hot roof without a shirt on?  Oh, God.  Boy, especially if you, like, put a tar and you rolled in it and then you rolled over  a wasp nest and they just crawled out and they were stuck to you and they just kept  stinging you because you were a hindrance.  A speck of that tar will get all over you, too.  A little fucking speck will get everywhere on you. 
[02:29:00]  It's amazing how that shit spreads.  Thank you, Howard.  Yeah, thanks, guys.  Where were you with the Patriot Act?  Speaking of, you know, the information thing.  Oh, sorry, Howard.  Originally, it sounds like a great idea, but when they started incorporating it for anti-terrorism,  but when they start incorporating it into people's private lives and shit like that, then it's  bad.  They started changing what the meaning of it was and, yeah, there was a lot of bad shit 
[02:29:30]  in it.  All right.  Yeah.  A lot of phone calls.  Where do we go next?  Oh, I know.  People love when I get fucking worked up.  Where do we go next?  Oh, boy.  Anthony's full of shit.  Oh, right.  Let's go to that one.  Let's go to Bill and Indiana.  From Rowe.  Bill.  Hey, how's it going?  Hey, Bill.  Hey, Bill.  Oh, Bill.  I just wanted to know what Anthony's thoughts were when Bush had plumbers and UPS agents  and different people that actually come into our fucking houses investigating us. 
[02:30:00]  UPS?  Yeah, he was having, I mean, anyone, there were commercials that said, if you see anything  suspicious, let us know.  Oh, Noel, the suspicious thing about, with terrorism, that's one thing.  If you see somebody fucking walking around and then leaves a briefcase next to a fucking  plane and then walks away, I think you should report it.  Yeah, Bill.  If someone's asking you to report opinions, someone's fucking opinion on a website to 
[02:30:30]  the White House, that's different.  What, sir?  All of a sudden, if people that are coming into your house see something that they disagree  with, say you're on the opposite side.  What?  Bomb-making materials?  Bill, that's not, Bill, what you're doing is you're taking something and you're making  it into what it wasn't.  When you said, look for something suspicious, they weren't saying go into people's houses  and see what their political opinions are.  They meant that we're taught to politely not acknowledge things that we kind of instinctively 
[02:31:00]  feel are wrong.  Like, if you see a Middle Eastern guy carrying a...  Like, you instinctively feel that...  Hold on, dude, hold on.  If you look at...  Like, we're taught politically correct that if you're in a subway and you see, like, a  Middle Eastern guy with a package looking around suspiciously, oh, that's nothing.  Like, your gut instinct goes, and that guy could be a problem.  Right.  That's the type of shit.  Not, hey, this guy has a conflicting political opinion, or he's posting on a website that  he doesn't like my plan.  Yeah.  All right.  You're talking ideas versus, like, actions.  Yeah. 
[02:31:30]  All right, thank you.  I think it was just about if you think something's going to endanger people, not ideologically,  but if you think a guy's about to do something, trust your gut instinct and just go talk to  a cop.  I think that's all I was saying.  All right, let's go to Paul in Oregon.  Paul.  Yeah.  Hi, Paul.  I'm not welcome.  My cat got me in trouble.  Your cat, Paul.  Sure did.  He's a good cat.  A thousand pictures, Paul?  That's great.  I know.  I have five cats and a bunch of different computers.  Paul, what do you got?  Oregon.  Not too liberal a state.  I just wanted to say, Ant, you're full of shit, dude. 
[02:32:00]  All righty.  Oh, shit.  Now, please explain why.  I like hearing why I'm full of shit.  It's amazing to me how you can sit there in your air-conditioned radio station and say that  Obama administration is akin to Nazis or communists because they want to put proper information  out there because people like you are stating that your life is going to be judged on a scale,  which it already is anyway, by the insurance companies because they deny your claims at least 
[02:32:30]  three to four times and see who they can weed out.  That's true.  But you're going to sit there and say that they're going to be Nazis or communists because  they're trying to put proper information out about this health care plan they're trying to pass?  No, no, no.  I'm not talking about putting proper information out.  I'm talking about gathering information that they deem is improper.  That, to me, is censorship on a huge scale.  And it's almost like, hey, tell us if this guy is writing something bad about us because 
[02:33:00]  we want to know about it.  It would be censorship if they said, OK, we get this information.  Now we're going to shut these people down.  Well, I don't know what they're going to do with it yet.  Something like that.  Exactly the point.  You don't know what they're going to do with it.  But instead of saying, OK, let me be rational about this, why would they want it?  Be rational about the rat out.  The rat out part is already out there.  I don't even give a shit what they do with the information.  They're asking people to rat out other people.  They're asking.  It would be that they're trying to put more information out there so people can get a fair 
[02:33:30]  assessment of what the plan is supposed to be.  Why should.  All right.  OK.  OK.  They want this information so they can shut it down just like they did in the communist  countries and just like they did in.  Yes.  Yes.  Whenever Obama is mentioned, unless he's saying, you know, swath of Italians get two guns  and expensive cars a week.  Yep.  You go nuts.  It's true.  I love how you brought.  That's what Obama's mentioned.  You go nuts.  I love how you brought race into it. 
[02:34:00]  Yep.  You're black, aren't you?  No, I'm not.  No, I'm not.  No, I'm not.  I'm kidding.  I happen to be Italian, too.  See, well, then you are kind of.  You're Sicilian?  Because let me tell you about the Moors.  The Moors invaded.  Here's the problem I have with what.  Shut up a minute.  I let you talk for a long time.  An hour and a half at least.  Let me now address what you said.  Please.  The fact is, it isn't so much.  They can write whatever they want on the White House website. 
[02:34:30]  They could put out all the proper information that they deem proper and factual and whatnot.  What they don't need in order to do that is to have other people turn in people with opposing views so that they can address that.  Just put the facts out there.  I know where I could get Obama's side of the story.  Whitehouse.org.gov.  I could go there.  I know to go there and get his side of the story. 
[02:35:00]  They don't have to rat out people that are writing other stuff and posting things on YouTube in order to get their side out.  Well, if Sarah Palin's point of the, what was it, the death camps or whatever it was that she was saying, Sarah Palin's point.  Oh, Sarah Palin's a fucking idiot.  I can't stand her.  And she fucking opens her mouth and shit pours out.  I agree with you.  I agree with you.  However, her point gets out there.  And then it's promoting on all of these, you know, the Limbaugh's and Glenn Beck's and all these other idiots to have opportunities to speak. 
[02:35:30]  And then that's the message that actually gets out there.  So it makes sense to set up a situation where they can say, look, we got this information.  This is the truth about it.  I don't know.  I just don't like the idea of ratting, having them solicit ratting other people's websites out to the White House, directly to the White House. 
[02:36:00]  That to me is a little.  Is there any idea that Obama's had that you like?  Is there any idea that Obama's had that I like?  That's a very good question.  Let me think.  Yeah, I'm not I'm not this fucking hardline conservative.  I don't care if homos want to get married.  Things like that.  Abortion's great with me.  Scrape them all out.  I could give a shit.  You don't care if the butt pirates get married?  No. 
[02:36:30]  No, I don't care.  Let the homos get married.  Let the fist fuckers get married, right?  You know what I see Obama's been doing?  Obama has been doing a lot of what Bush did with terrorism and the war.  Bush did nothing but get on TV and talk about terrorism, terrorism, terrorism.  But Obama's whole thing is the economy.  Now, I do realize the economy is in the shitter.  But, you know, the war was not going well either. 
[02:37:00]  Still isn't.  But that seemed to be what they cling on to.  They find something and then hang this fear over your head with it.  And I'd like to hear him talk about other things.  But is there anything that he's done that I've liked?  I've got to give that a thought.  Wait a minute.  No, because he really didn't get involved with the homos or anything like that.  He's against gay marriage and he's against abortion.  I really don't like any of his policies. 
[02:37:30]  You're right.  There's nothing he's done so far that I've been for.  And it's not just based on party lines or anything.  I just – this guy's doing nothing in my best interest.  Sorry.  All right, Paul.  Anthony, pretty good.  So now we're going to give him one phone call that agrees with him.  You only get one, though, Ant.  Mike in Westchester.  Mike.  How are you doing, guys?  Big fan.  You know, Anthony is 100% correct when it comes to this, his opinion, because Stalin did the  same thing in the 30s, but it was called political purging. 
[02:38:00]  98% of the Washington press corps is Democratic, and they admittedly voted for Obama.  The major networks, otherwise known as the state-run media, often slant to his side.  So how he needs another venue, as Anthony puts it, rat out opposing opinions.  I mean, if people don't see this, they're just fooling themselves.  Yeah, his opinion is called the news.  You know, the Internet, I don't think they have to worry so much about websites when they 
[02:38:30]  got CNN and CBS and MSNBC just touting this guy no matter what the fuck he does.  And, you know, you write an opinion or post some actual his words speeches, and they got  to spin it around like, oh, these are just fucking evil anti-American people on the Internet.  But Rush Limbaugh, you know, he makes sure that Obama's not getting too out of control.  Look, Rush has his agenda, too.  The guy's fucking happy as a pig in shit that Obama's in the White House.  It brought his career right back.  So there's another guy. 
[02:39:00]  You can't trust what he's saying either.  But he's known to be biased, though.  He's known to be biased.  Yeah, exactly.  But that's his thing.  But people actually think I would listen to him and go, yeah, that's what...  No.  I'm looking at...  But can I say something about Rush Limbaugh?  Rush Limbaugh, he's a private enterprise.  If people stop buying his product, whatever he advertises, he would cease to exist.  Obama's in power.  So he has the power to throw a press conference.  As a matter of fact, the recent flyover in New York City of Air Force One, the New York 
[02:39:30]  Times had to sue under the Freedom of Information Act to actually get photos that should just  be out there.  Why?  Because it wouldn't negatively paint the Obama administration.  Well, that's...  And that's his transparent administration that is going to be so different than George  Bush's was.  It's just...  This guy...  It's just this phoniness about what he presented himself as and what he is.  Absolutely.  You guys are the best.  Stay strong, sir.  Yes, we are.  Hey, let me ask you something, though. 
[02:40:00]  I mean, you're making some very valid points, but let's say the next time we got a Republican  president, don't you think it's going to be the same way where he controls the press  and controls those press conferences down in Washington?  Yes.  Don't you think the system in general is flawed now?  Exactly.  I want something more libertarian, but the third party, we've talked about this before,  they can't be.  It's divvied up between the Republicans and the Democrats before we ever get to even see  what the fuck is going to happen.  But next time we get a Republican president, you know, they're going to be knocking a lot 
[02:40:30]  of those guys out of Washington going, ah, you don't see it our way.  We need to bring in our own people to help us out here.  The thing is, the press will always be biased, Democrat, liberal.  It doesn't matter who's in the fucking White House.  So they always have that machine working for them.  They don't like to admit that their political leanings do slant the way they present the  news.  They admit that they're liberal because they have to kind of declare who they...  I think it's eight or nine people... 
[02:41:00]  Yes, out of ten.  No, eight or nine people that work for Obama now in the White House are former fucking  news writers, reporters.  I mean, he...  These are his pals.  These are his asshole buddies.  Right.  No surprise, though.  But no, it is no surprise.  You don't want to surround yourself with guys that are just going to be a fucking pain in  the ass.  No, I understand that.  Like a bunch of hornets.  You don't want to hang out with hornets.  It is just the fact that it proves that there's so many people in the press that are just 
[02:41:30]  lapping this guy's ass no matter what he does.  So then when you get opposing viewpoints on the internet and then to have the White House go,  hey, when you read one of those, you let us know who's saying and what they're saying  because we want to check it out.  That, to me, is a little frightening.  Are you saying if you're a blogger out there, you don't want to be on the White House radar?  You don't want to be on the White House radar.  Thank you.  Could you imagine getting just an email from whitehouse.org?  Could you please stop?  They ask you nicely the first time.  Next thing you know, you're dying of food poisoning somewhere. 
[02:42:00]  You're a fucking water car guy.  Exactly.  You're a fucking water car guy.  Oh, no.  They're on to me, man.  Poor bloggers.  Wow, this guy actually read.  Mark, you're actually doing some reading?  Absolutely.  No, he's not.  He's going to reference.  Hold on.  He's going to reference page 465 in Obama's health care plan.  Oh, is that the mandatory?  Get the fuck out of here.  You know what he's.  Oh, you saw it on the screen?  Of course I did.  Holy shit, you just scared the fuck out of me. 
[02:42:30]  Wow.  Mark in Philly, what's up?  How you doing, guys?  Good, man.  I'm in the health care industry, and what nobody's talking about is his mandatory health counseling  beginning at age 65 every five years, so you hit 75 after that every three years, and it  decreases after you hit 85.  What the concern is, is this is going to set up an environment where single people or people  with limited income or resources are going to get coached into not getting good health 
[02:43:00]  care or life-sustaining health care.  Who said that?  It's in his.  No, no, no, but they're going to get, that the advice is going to be, don't get life-sustaining  health care.  If you have terminal cancer, it's opening up a Pandora's box to where it could go that  way.  All right, well, okay, but I understand that you're just saying, you're looking at something  and you're giving a slippery slope argument, going, well, it could be.  I honestly, whether you like Obama or not, I don't think the intent of the health care 
[02:43:30]  bill to say, get counsel when you're in your 80s, is to let's see who we can cut off, look,  so they don't live.  You know what?  The bottom line.  When you have family and support systems, what would be the benefit to health care counseling?  Well, who said that you're not going to have your support systems and family there?  It's almost like one additional thing.  It keeps you in the system because a lot of people don't go to the doctor for fucking  18 years and they probably have things that could have been fixed a lot cheaper that turn  into major problems.  What's wrong with preventative health care when you're fucking old? 
[02:44:00]  Because people are living longer and longer now, man.  80 is not going to be the fucking be-all, end-all age.  80 is the new 60.  By the time we're up in that age, they say 80 is going to be the new three.  Yes.  It's going to be wonderful.  We'll live to 120 years old.  I noticed, Jimmy, you're a slippery slope.  Do we really deal with slippery slopes?  Yes.  It's a cop-out argument always.  No, I know.  But I mean, I'm just talking about a slippery slope.  No, I avoid them.  No one deals with that shit.  I go around.  Exactly.  You know, if you're skiing, that's what you want.  A slippery slope. 
[02:44:30]  Yes.  But if you're a slug going uphill because a man with a heart on us is chasing you.  That's terrible.  You know what it is?  If you look at it in these terms, the government running health care, walk into any fucking  department of motor vehicles or a post office or anything like that and look how that runs  and go, do I really want my health care run like motor vehicles?  You know what?  They actually do run fairly well now and so does the post office.  Oh, when you sit in those seats and it's just fucking a bunch of people wasting money 
[02:45:00]  sitting there fucking not doing one person's working, five people are behind the fucking  counter not doing anything.  The new automated ones they have are good.  There's one actually in Herald Square.  Also automated doctors.  That'd be great.  You just slip your dick in there.  It reads your fucking urine and then something comes out and cuts out your kidney.  I don't know if I'd like that.  Darren from Augusta, he's pleading with me to read this to you. 
[02:45:30]  Oh, OK.  Opie, please.  And that's all caps.  So ask Ed if he thinks there's a difference between opposing points of view and just false  propaganda.  Please.  I would love to hear his answer.  Opposing points of view and false propaganda.  Of course, there's a difference.  But the thing is, they're not making a distinction between what is to be ratted out.  And the rats themselves wouldn't make a distinction.  If you're going to turn in somebody to the White House because of what they're writing on 
[02:46:00]  a website, you're not going to look for misinformation.  You're going to look for opposing viewpoints and then you're going to send those over to  the White House.  Just I mean.  Yeah, there is a difference.  But let me tell you something else.  The White House puts out its own fucking false information and propaganda.  Sure.  Man.  That's true, man.  Richard in Iowa.  Richard.  All right. 
[02:46:30]  You've got me on one thing.  You drink the same beer as Obama.  I'm sure you've changed brands by now.  You can't allow that to continue to happen, right?  Liking the same beer as Obama.  No, I drink milk.  I'm cool.  No, I'll still drink a little Bud Light.  Sure.  Guinness.  I drink Guinness.  That's a dark beer. 
[02:47:00]  Check it out, guys.  Yeah, you do that.  All right.  Should we continue with this or what?  Someone's got to tinkle.  I'll go tinkle while you guys are doing this.  Don wants to know if we're raising a generation of super kids.  Wow.  I truly believe.  What a good question.  We really are.  How about this guy?  Scott in Kansas.  What do we do with Scott?  He's a queer.  Scott.  Hey, guys.  Hey.  I had some chest pains a couple weeks ago.  I went to a doctor.  And they wanted me to do a stress test.  Yeah.  So I called. 
[02:47:30]  See how much it was.  $5,600 bucks.  $5,600 bucks.  To get.  Hook up some wires to you.  Now, will the government control.  Are they going to come in and say, okay, I'm going to pay $50 on this shit?  Is that it?  Do you have insurance?  That's ridiculous.  I've got insurance.  That's a dumb treadmill is all it is.  But it's going to cost me $1,500 bucks out of my pocket.  $1,500 instead of $5,600. 
[02:48:00]  That sounds kind of reasonable, my friend.  Well, it is reasonable.  For the peace of mind that maybe your fucking heart isn't going to stop.  You know?  What would you get with government health care?  Do you know maybe you wouldn't even get in in time when your chest is hurting to fucking get that stress test?  I don't know.  These are questions I want answered.  But the truth of the matter is I don't fucking know because it hasn't been spelt out. 
[02:48:30]  And the numbers are just too high to take care of that many people to the degree that you are able to actually go on a $5,600 machine and make sure you're okay.  I can't see that happening with everyone in the country being covered under one blanket government system.  Sorry.  I don't see it.  Now, one more point I'd like to bring up is I called my insurance company a C because I'm a smoker, which is stupid as hell. 
[02:49:00]  How old are you?  I'm 54.  You still smoke?  Oh, hell yeah.  Why don't you just quit?  Get rid of those fucking cigarettes.  They kill you.  They are going to kill me.  Death in a box.  Just quit.  But listen, I asked them if they took Chantex and paid for that, which is $100 a month.  And they said, no, we do not cover that.  But they will cover Viagra.  Well, that is ridiculous.  All right.  That is ridiculous.  And the lady said, yeah, I know this too. 
[02:49:30]  We'll pay for an erection for a man, which I know is very important.  But we will not pay for...  The cigarette he has...  Here's the weird thing.  And I'm an ex-smoker.  Did I smoke for 17 years?  Ant's the next smoker.  You're choosing to smoke.  I know it's a brutal addiction.  That's true.  But it's almost like now we all have to pay for your health woes.  And I'm not shitting on you because, again, I was a smoker.  But, I mean, that's the way the system is flawed.  It's like we're all paying for a choice you're making.  And you know what I mean? 
[02:50:00]  So it's like you should quit.  Oh, I know I should quit.  Well, you know what?  It's not as bad as you think, man.  If I can do it, you certainly could.  He knows they should quit.  Here's a scenario for you also.  Do you think under a government insurance plan that he would actually be allowed to be covered and smoke?  Let's think about that.  Do you think that the government agency that's in charge of health care would go, look, if you're smoking, you're forfeiting this amount of our protection?  I don't know.  Don't regular insurance companies do that?  No, I'm just saying. 
[02:50:30]  They'll charge you higher rates.  But I'm just saying, like, that to me, I see a business like an insurance company saying, look, you want to smoke and you want us to pay for your fucking health care?  It's going to cost you more money.  You're a smoker.  Good point.  The government then telling you what you can and can't do based on your health is a different thing to me for some reason.  Don't ask me to explain it because I kind of can't yet.  I got to mush it around in my head.  But the government telling anybody what they can or can't do because they now control how your health care is handled is just weird to me. 
[02:51:00]  There's too many variables that can happen there.  Well, I think it has to be worked out, obviously.  I mean, I don't want the government controlling.  But they do control a certain amount of what we do anyway.  Oh, I know they do.  But this seems very – it gets very personal when it's your body.  Look at the abortion issue.  It's been one of the biggest fucking hot issues for years.  This is – and the whole basis of that is a woman's body is her body. 
[02:51:30]  She should be able to do what she wants with it.  Health care under a government umbrella would be the same thing.  You're sitting there going, it's my body.  I should be able to have it fixed in the way I want to have it fixed by the person I want to have it fixed.  If I want to smoke and it's going to cost me more now to pay for my health care, that's my prerogative.  Fuck you.  I'll do it anyway.  To have a government agency over your head looking over how healthy you're keeping yourself, if you're doing things, whether you're going to qualify because of certain actions or hobbies you have. 
[02:52:00]  What about people that like skydiving or repelling, dangerous hobbies, things like that?  Are they going to be exempt?  Are they going to have to have some kind of a – I don't know, pay more?  I don't know what it is.  I don't think it's going to be that.  I'm speculating right now.  Look, look, don't fuck it.  I'm speculating.  I think you're always going to be allowed to have private insurance because the private insurance industry isn't just going to go away quietly. 
[02:52:30]  But that's the whole argument Obama's saying.  But they're not – what do you think they're going to do?  They're not going to fight him in court?  They're not just going to go away?  The intent.  It's a billion – billions of dollars of business.  Whatever it is, Obama's intent, what he said in these speeches,  which is the whole fucking thing about this misinformation and disinformation.  In his speeches, he is talking about the government running health care and no private insurance companies.  But again, the guy can only do so much.  Because he was saying that at one point doesn't mean realistically he can do it. 
[02:53:00]  I know you can only do so much.  He's not going to do it.  I know.  But the intent is socialist.  The intent that's there, his passion for it is – not worse,  but is bad in his ideology, in his thinking.  I don't like that mindset that he's so dedicated to that, whether it passes or not.  Talk about – I mean, again, devil's advocate for –  But look at – like he wanted a constitutional amendment saying gay people can't –  I didn't like his fucking mindset either. 
[02:53:30]  No, no, no.  Of course.  But I'm saying that to me that's a socialist ideology too.  It's saying who you can – how you can live and what you can do.  I mean, that's a complete government control over the lives of private citizens.  And it's obviously conservative and shitty, but no one accuses Bush of being socialist.  Well, look at the language he used.  It was the marriage protection thing.  It had nothing to do with gays being married.  It wasn't an anti-gay marriage thing.  It was a let's protect marriage between a man and a woman, 
[02:54:00]  which they'll always present it as a protection, and meanwhile they're taking it out of your other fucking pocket.  But we all knew what it was.  Yeah, yeah, we all knew what it was.  But that's another thing.  Bush's mindset when it came to shit like that, that fucking hard-right Christian bullshit,  that I couldn't stand out of him.  It was terrible.  Scott and Hot Pog, Anthony, bad news.  Just so you know, I've already reported this show to the White House.  Sorry, but it was my duty.  Aw, shit.  See?  One more phone call before the break.  Richard – not Richard. 
[02:54:30]  Sorry, Richard.  I've got to go to a –  Treehouse?  Danny in Canada.  We've got to go to a Canadian and see what he's thinking about this whole thing.  Danny, what do you got?  Hey, guys.  Love the show.  Thank you a lot.  Of course you do.  What else are you going to listen to?  We love you, too, Anthony, you psychotic freak.  Ah, shut up, you pot-smoking Canuck.  Yeah.  You're good for nothing, peace, Nick, you elk fucker.  Here's the deal.  Here's the deal.  Here's the deal.  I'm 30 years old.  My wife is 32.  I have two small kids.  I make over $100,000 a year.  My wife's got meningitis. 
[02:55:00]  My son was two months old.  Went into a hospital.  There was never a question of, you know, what – it was just they were going to save  her life, and that's all there was to it.  She was there for a month.  Came out.  No bill.  No problem.  Thank you very much.  I have chest pains.  I go to a doctor, whatever.  I'm there.  One hour, two hours in the waiting room.  I don't see the big issue.  It's called socialized medicine.  I love the one or two hours in the waiting room when you have chest pains.  Yeah, chest pains.  You shouldn't have one or two hours in a waiting room. 
[02:55:30]  That's not a long two hours just sitting there.  Jesus Christ.  Guys, man.  What the fuck?  What?  Not a thing.  Not one cent.  Not one red cent.  Yeah, but –  They're higher.  I heard the waiting – I heard the waiting is very long.  And if you have chest pain –  That's a scary two hours.  Two hours.  You have one chest pain.  You're like, all right, what the fuck is that?  And you want to go to a hospital immediately and you go, all right, maybe it was the chili  dog I ate at the Yankee game.  But you know what?  He's got to go to this fucking, you know, Canada National Hospital instead of, you know, 
[02:56:00]  LIJ or fucking St. Francis or some nice, really good fucking hospital where they are  going to take you right the fuck in because you have your insurance card.  And you have chest pains, Danny.  Yeah.  You messed up your argument a little bit.  Waiting two hours, three hours in a waiting room with chest pains is – that is like,  what the fuck?  You got to wait six months for an abortion?  Oh, my God.  That's terrible.  Jesus.  Six months.  At any hospital, at any time.  All I'm saying is that you guys have socialist programs already that work really well. 
[02:56:30]  Name 40.  Your police department.  Those aren't social – stop it.  I've heard this argument before.  The police department is not a socialized program.  You know what makes America so great and makes the world look up to them?  That we're not fucking Canada.  Yes.  It's that you guys take care of your citizens.  But you're not doing it now.  Why don't you?  You guys have more social problems than anyone else.  Why don't we?  And that is why you are not the leader of the free world anymore.  Did you write a check?  Oh, shit. 
[02:57:00]  Oh, shit.  Look up to Americans.  Oh, wow.  Oh, shit.  We're not the leaders anymore.  They better fucking look up to us or your country is fucked.  We're the only reason you're not fucking goose-stepping, motherfuckers, you stupid Canadians.  We better be the best.  We better be the best because we're the only thing between you and fucking defeat.  You don't think Russia would have taken you over?  You don't think the Soviet fucking Union –  Oh, he doesn't want to talk to you, Ed.  Soviet Union. 
[02:57:30]  He hung up.  He didn't want to talk to you.  He's like, here we go.  Welcome to North.  Oh, he's still there.  Fucking – welcome to West Moscow, motherfucker.  Canada would have been a fucking communist country if it wasn't for us.  You and your stupid mounies.  You and your stupid red-suited, stupid hat mounie.  Yeah, let your mounies fight.  Let your mounies fight.  I think they can fight.  No, they can't.  They're on horses.  They look a little strange.  One tank and they're all dead.  One tank, they're dead.  They look like they can fight.  They're stupid.  They all have flags. 
[02:58:00]  We can't fight.  You can't fight.  How do you balance that hat on your head?  Yeah, and you got the easiest fucking beach on D-Day, motherfuckers.  Just take care of yourself.  That's all I'm saying.  Ah!  Come on.  Selfish is so selfish.  That's true.  Yep.  Selfish is no good.  Selfish.  Yeah, yeah.  Let me – let me – let me – let me – let me – let me – let me – let me  – let me – let me – let me – let me – let me show you a check I wrote  for my fucking taxes so you can tell me how selfish I am.  Blow me!  Oh, please.  Shut up!  Please.  Bye. 
[02:58:30]  Please what?  Show you?  He's saying crime or whatever.  We are doing our part.  Oh my God, am I doing my fucking part.  I know that much.  I'm doing my part.  Dude, the more fucking money I make, it's like every gig I do, whether it's fucking  August 21st or 22nd.  Oh no!  I don't like the cheap plug, Jimmy.  That was a great plug.  I don't like the cheap plug.  I thought he had a point to make.  He was in it.  It was great.  I had a great joke to follow up with.  You were in the moment.  It's, you know, I was just going to say that.  Let's just say, for instance, I'm doing August 21, 22. 
[02:59:00]  I'm in Wildwood at Club Casbah.  Nice.  You know, so what?  People want to go 609-522-8444.  That's not important, right?  It means nothing.  I haven't been in Wildwood in years.  Small, intimate club setting.  You want to come?  Have some fun.  You don't want to come?  It's not about that.  I'm sorry.  It's about health care.  Right.  If I trip and fall on the boardwalk, say I'm in between my sold out of late show and the  early show the next day, who's going to care for me, Ope?  That's the point you're trying to make.  Of course it is.  What if little Jimmy gets a splinter on the boardwalk? 
[02:59:30]  What if I get a splinter?  I'm still going to go there and perform those shows.  Yes.  Who's going to be there to help her hurt it?  Club Casbah, Wildwood.  Club Casbah.  Okay.  August 21, 20.  What better way to end the summer than by heckling?  Yes.  I haven't been to Wildwood in years.  I'm nervous.  No.  It'll be great.  You're going to kill.  Gangs.  Great gangs.  The gangs of Wildwood.  Yes.  Oh, no.  It's the fucking Sandy Beaches.  That's oof.  They're here against the Ferris's.  Awful gangs. 
[03:00:00]  They're terrible.  Fruits.  Yeah.  It's the fucking, it's the sand granules against the mullets.  Okay.  But yeah, you can't say that you're not doing your part.  You're paying taxes.  It's like, oof.  Oh, my God.  It's brutal.  I've run a couple of fucking doozies myself.  Don't ask where all that money's going, though.  That would be a crazy thing to ask.  Yeah, yeah.  How the fuck don't they have enough money to do everything they want with the taxes they  take from us?  It's amazing to me.  Joe. 
[03:00:30]  Yeah.  Hey.  I just wanted to let y'all in on all these damn bureaucrat-loving hippies that have tried  to do this shit before.  Can you say man after you say hippie?  Man.  With the flood insurance a couple decades ago, the government overtook that, too.  Yep.  And if you go and try and find an independent offer in flood insurance, you'll never find  that anywhere because they...  What happened with this?  That's a great example.  When the government took over flood insurance, holy shit. 
[03:01:00]  Now, your beach side, try to get fucking flooded.  Well, you can't because the government took over.  So everyone gets flood insurance now, right?  No, they assess your...  They went the other way with that.  They assess the threat of them having to pay you by living on the beach like an idiot.  But, yeah.  And then they won't give you insurance.  And another thing is that in the bill, all these government agencies, all the unions and  everything else is exempt, sir.  It's good enough for us, but it's not good enough for them. 
[03:01:30]  And that's just a crock.  And if nobody can see that, I think they just got their head so far up their ass, they should  suffocate to death anyway.  All right.  And, yes, the government took it over because no other insurance company even wanted to  handle flood insurance anymore.  I'm offering it.  But are you?  Yes.  Yeah, Ted's flood insurance.  Yes.  Oh, Jesus.  No.  Yes.  Yeah, Ted's flood insurance.  It's very popular.  Is it, Ted?  Where can I get this?  In certain states, you can get it.  Like, you can get it in South Dakota. 
[03:02:00]  That's very dry, though.  You can also get it in Chicago, in any skyscraper.  Now, I can understand that.  What's the name of the insurance company so I can write it down?  Ted's flood safety and security emporium.  We sell bags that you can put sand in or other items.  Oh, okay.  What other items would you put in the sandbags?  Oh, many things.  You can put rocks, hats, perhaps Super Bowls if you're giving them to friends.  How would a hat protect against flooding? 
[03:02:30]  Oh, I'm thinking about flooding.  I'm thinking about storage.  Okay.  It doesn't flood much in Ohio.  $3,000 a month, I'll cover you.  Oh, that's nice.  I don't pay out, but if your house gets flooded, I come over there and I dry it off.  You go with some towels?  Yes, I do with a bunch of towelettes and buckets.  Ted's an asshole.  I like Ted's flood insurance.  Yes, I knew someone would cover it.  I think it's going to be a booming business for you, Ted. 
[03:03:00]  Oh, has your house been carried away?  Let me sop that right up for you.  Boomer from Jersey writes, Opie, when Ant calms down, remind him that Obama will soon be after  his gas-guzzling Mustang and make him turn off that energy-wasting pool heater of his.  Yep.  Then sit back and smile.  Exactly.  Oh, he would never do that.  How's the cash for clunkers going?  Good?  What was that about?  They were giving a few grand if you bring in your shitty car, your gas guzzler, and buy 
[03:03:30]  a new car, which kind of worked.  I thought, I kind of like the cash for clunkers program.  That was good.  It stimulates the car market a little bit.  People are buying new cars, which, you know, you kind of need that right now.  So, all right.  I kind of liked that.  All right.  There you go.  Phones are lit.  We'll figure out what to do next.  How's that?  Anything going on a break?  Mary and Barry stopped by.  Now, there's a good politician. 
[03:04:00]  Holy shit.  That's someone I want to say, God bless him.  We dragged him in studio on Friday.  I think it's worth replaying.  It's like three minutes.  Maybe after the break, we get into that.  I think his HBO thing is running tonight.  I want to see that.  His special looks really good.  Yeah.  And he said, what did he say?  He said he took a drag.  He didn't.  Nobody knows what was in those.  No one knows what was in that pipe.  But what did he say about dragging inhale or something?  Did you smoke?  He goes, I didn't smoke.  I took a drag.  Right, right, right.  That's what it was.  He didn't smoke.  He took a drag.  Opie and Anthony stay there. 
[03:04:30]  We learned during the break that Anthony's pool is set at 93 degrees.  Yes.  On the weekends, I pumped that thing up to about 93 degrees.  How about you spend less money on heating your pool and help the unfortunate?  At a boil.  No.  Thank you, Jimmy.  By doing so, I am helping the less fortunate. 
[03:05:00]  How?  By paying a giant electric bill.  I don't know where that goes.  Does your pool really need to be 93?  I know you like it warmer than most pools, but.  It doesn't need to be.  When does it get to a point where it's good enough?  80?  Is 80 cold for you?  No, no.  80.  Here's the pool Anthony likes.  The pools in the low to mid-70s feel really cold.  But 80 would seem pretty nice.  Here is the pool Anthony likes.  All right.  I walk in. 
[03:05:30]  And you can't even tell that you're in water?  And I don't have to stop at the crotch level and go, oh, I don't have to stop at nipple  level.  You just jump in.  And I don't have to stop at shoulder level.  Jump in, let it cool off your body immediately.  Within 30 seconds or a minute, you feel very refreshed and you don't know the difference.  No, you're slightly chilly.  I don't even like being slightly chilly in a pool.  When it's really hot out and you jump in a cold pool, it's kind of like, eh, I like  it warm.  And then when you get out and you're wet, it feels cool. 
[03:06:00]  You're going to have to tell off.  No, now you're all cooling off.  It's great.  You know how awful pools must have been like in ancient Greece or ancient Rome?  No filter.  No filter.  No chlorine.  Just lake water.  Fucking filthy bugs on them.  What do they do?  Piss and shit.  Well, they shit in the pool, but...  Maybe.  Your pool's really at 93 because people are shocked.  Kyle S. from Indiana writes, 93, my hot tub is set at 97.  My hot tub is at 104.  That's hot. 
[03:06:30]  Because Jimmy made me so angry.  Why?  I didn't mean to.  By calling it gazpacho.  What was wrong with his hot tub there?  Nothing.  If you've been scalded in a fire and they have to cool you off, his hot tub was perfect.  It wasn't hot.  Yeah, it was a fucking cold.  It was a tub.  It was a bubbling fucking ice bucket.  It was the first time I was using it and I couldn't figure it out and I still can't  figure it out totally yet, but the propane heater heats that one.  The electric one heats the pool and then I crank it up, but then I shut it off completely 
[03:07:00]  and then let the temperature go down and then as the week goes on, I let the temperature  go down and then I boost it back up for the weekend, but today it's going to be like  over 90 degrees in New York, so I'm not going to turn the heater on.  I'm just going to get in and fucking jump in.  So if it's going to be over 90, that means your water is going to be hotter than the  air temperature in your pool.  Yeah.  That's weird.  But that way when you get out-  Don't you want it a little cooler?  No.  That way when I get out, you feel cool.  You feel hot as shit. 
[03:07:30]  No, no, because the water was hot.  Now you get out and the air temperature is cooler, so now you're like, ah.  That's the logic?  Okay.  Yeah, but then if you have a cooler, ah, whatever.  I'm coming over next week, by the way.  Your body temperature is nice and cool, so then it feels cooler when you're out.  It actually feels very good.  And it feels very buoyant.  You feel very buoyant in warmer water.  And what's with falling asleep on top of the water on a floaty thing for two hours on Friday?  I did that Friday.  He's showing us his sunburn.  It's not good, Jim.  I was very tired Friday, and we did the show, got home, had a beer, and then I was like, 
[03:08:00]  you know, it's such a nice day.  I hate the idea of, and we have to nap and shit like that, hate the idea of napping when  it's a great day out.  So I said, no, I'm going to get my shorts.  Go get your nap.  I'm going to get my little floaty mat and put it in the pool and lay down on that for  a little while and just relax.  Right.  So I'm relaxing, and then all of a sudden I woke up, and I looked at my watch, and it 
[03:08:30]  was two hours that I'd been laying there in the pool with the sun beating.  There is nary a leaf shadow on my pool either.  It's not like, I hate when people go, you got to keep the pool in the shade.  Like, people set up their pool to put it in the shade.  No, the sun's got a beat on it.  As soon as the sun goes down behind your neighbor's house, you're like, ah, this pool sucks.  Yeah, so you need it in the sun.  Yeah.  So I was just floating around in the sun for two hours and got so burned. 
[03:09:00]  You're just completely passed out in your pool just floating around getting burned.  Getting burned.  Getting barbecued.  Do you use the jacuzzi in winter or no?  No, it's hooked up to the same plumbing as the pool.  So once you close the pool up, everything's got to get closed up.  That's bullshit.  Why didn't you have that separate so you could, like, do the run out in the middle of winter  and jump in your hot tub?  I'm not really one of the, no.  You know what I like in the winter?  I like the fireplace roaring, the high def on, sitting there with a nice cold brewski 
[03:09:30]  just on the couch.  That's the winter for me.  Or down in the theater.  Down in the theater, as Sal calls it, the theater.  Another thing, beer, movie.  The summer, the pool.  I'm coming over next week.  I'll say it again.  I'm going to have a snack list.  Things I expect to be there waiting with glee.  Are you saying he doesn't have snacks, Jimmy?  What's that?  You're saying he doesn't have snacks?  Fucking awful.  Flies were landing on me.  Worst snacks ever? 
[03:10:00]  Lack of.  Got real, real pretzels now.  JetBlue has better snacks than Anthony's house?  Blue chips.  Yeah, he came by and handed us each little bag of peanuts, so we'll be landing in six  hours.  Enjoy.  Enjoy the cold pool.  By the way, Keith in Philly, oh, please tell Aunt that I'll be over tonight because my  stove is broken and I'm going to use this pool to boil eggs.  Yes.  Yeah, you really could.  Burl a potato.  Burl.  My father used to say that.  Burl.  I'd be real hot.  I'd say, I want to put the air on.  He'd say, go burl a potato on yourself. 
[03:10:30]  Burl.  I hate the word burl.  Hey, we got to get this story on the air.  A man was hiding a gun in his fat rolls.  I'm sure you heard the story by now, but we got to get it on for the people.  It was a misunderstanding.  It was a plastic dick.  And they weren't fat rolls.  They were my butt cheeks.  Jesus.  And you can get money back from Obama if you change your heater for your pool, you know. 
[03:11:00]  Why, it's a brand new heater!  Yeah, but you get money for that stuff.  No, I won't.  It's brand new.  Let's ask Ben in Philly.  It's a high efficiency.  Hey, guys.  Yeah, and Obama's got money set aside that you can get money back if you change out that  heater to a solar thermal heater.  Solar?  It'll take your pool up to about 140 degrees, but he'll give you like 50% back for every dollar  that you spend on it, plus it'll pay itself off in two years.  There you go. 
[03:11:30]  Solar heater.  Yeah, what's wrong with the solar heater?  Stop it, because the sun hasn't been out in fucking three months in New York.  It'll store it up, though.  Yeah, sure.  They use the same thing for hospitals, and you're a smart guy.  Take a black hose, run it on your fancy little pool back there.  Yeah, you take a black hose, motherfucker.  Jesus.  He's just trying to help you out, my God.  I am running a fucking propane heater and a heat pump, two of the most least economical  ways to heat a pool.  It would actually be fucking, you should actually hire somebody with matches to light them and 
[03:12:00]  then jump in quickly.  That's it.  I have a blacksmith that heats up horseshoes and just throws them in the deep end.  Good day, guys.  All right, let's go to Kevin.  Kevin.  Anthony, dude, how come you don't have the blow-up heat pool cover?  Come on, man.  What, what?  The solar heat cover?  No, no, no, no, no.  It's a completely enclosed blow-up balloon.  Oh, like so you could use it in the winter.  Yeah.  Because I have a bi-level setup, my friend. 
[03:12:30]  It's the pool, and then it steps up.  Wait, what's this balloon thing?  It's like you ever see on the practice.  Like you give your own pool a dome?  Yeah, you ever see the practice things like we went to at the football game at Giants  You can do that with your pool now?  Yeah.  That's the latest technology?  Why don't you do that?  It's been around for a while.  Could you do that?  I don't know.  I got a bi-level thing going on.  You bi-level fucking domes?  Dude, how cool would that be at your house?  Dude, that'd be great.  We could fucking hang out all winter, sit in the fucking thing.  It'd be scary.  Let me see what one of those looks like.  I've never heard of that before.  I'd be frightened.  It probably goes around the pool.  How high up does it go, Kevin? 
[03:13:00]  It's two feet.  Everybody ducks.  Huh?  The size is very.  It just depends on the pool.  I mean, it's got to be, you know, it's going to be a custom-made thing, of course, for Anthony's pool, I'm sure.  Dude, you've got to get one of those.  Yeah.  I don't get one of those.  It would look a little ugly in your backyard, but who gives a shit?  You know what, though?  You could use your pool.  You have the greatest pool, and you could swim in the winter.  But I'd still have to heat the pool then in the winter, which is a lot more than the fucking summer.  Oh, jeez.  Come on, man. 
[03:13:30]  What?  I'm not a heater.  How do you heat a pool when the weather is fucking under 30 degrees with a heat pump?  Well, the dome.  You tell me, Mr. Air Conditioner.  If you have a dome, you're keeping a lot of the heat in, no?  And also, you could probably get heaters in the dome that would keep the pool a little warm.  Hawk Down looks cool as shit.  I live in...  But is shit cool?  Probably not.  Okay, we get all the same weather.  All right, Kevin.  He's not listening to you.  All right, Kevin.  He's now checking text messages, so you bored him.  We don't know what you're talking about, Kevin.  Oh, great.  It's a day where it's fucking 90 degrees, putting a new door on my house. 
[03:14:00]  And Ang now has the air conditioner on full blast with a giant hole in the front of my house.  Nice.  So more energy.  There you go.  I am...  The biggest waste of energy is me.  You're personally ruining the environment.  You know that.  I'm trying.  Let's look into this, Matt.  Wait a minute.  I'm sorry.  Rowan here is suggesting, I paint my pool with thermite paint to heat it up.  It's not a bad idea. 
[03:14:30]  Thermite paint.  Not a bad idea.  Heats up pretty good.  A gun found on an inmate in the Harris County Jail.  Tonight, the Sheriff's Department says the inmate actually told them he was packing heat  after being behind bars for hours.  How did he hide the weapon?  You know, we asked him personally and he wouldn't say, but we're told it was actually hidden  between layers of his skin.  This is...  So then he...  Then you do know.  Yeah.  Layers of...  How is it?  You gotta be a fat fuck.  Nobody went to put their hand under fat rolls. 
[03:15:00]  Yeah.  You want to search through a man's fat rolls when he's getting locked up?  Wow.  Skin.  This is 25-year-old George Vera.  We found him at home out on bond after Houston police confirmed that he was able to hide  a weapon for more than a day while in custody.  Obviously, the system broke down and the procedures didn't work as they're designed to work.  Police tell us Vera was arrested August 2nd by Houston police officers and taken to the  City Jail.  He spent a day there before being transferred to the Harris County Jail.  After being there for 14 hours going through the intake procedures, he's taken to the showers, 
[03:15:30]  the final step before going to his cell.  There, Vera tells police he has a weapon.  If a person has a weapon or narcotics or anything of danger on them, they should be found before  he ends up in the county jail.  Now, we're talking about a gun that would be about this size along with not one but two  magazines going through potentially three searches.  Do you have two magazines?  The shower he'd do would probably fuck him up, though. 
[03:16:00]  But he should have left it in the back of a police car, so he should have just left it  in the cell.  How much did he weigh?  I don't know.  600 pounds.  140.  600.  Jesus.  Under his bag.  Yeah, he was all cocked his kid.  Giant balls.  Wow.  The officer may not have encountered someone this large.  See, Vera weighs nearly 600 pounds.  And the gun was allegedly hidden between layers.  Houston Police Officers Union President Gary Blankenship says cadets are trained how to  search morbidly obese people.  We teach the officers to lift up and look under, and if it's there, it needs to be searched. 
[03:16:30]  But he says clearly that system does not always work.  You know, they can be so big that just basically short of strip searching the person and doing  cavity searches, you could miss something like this.  Now, both Houston Police and the Harris County Sheriff's Office are doing internal investigations  to figure out how this could have happened.  Blankenship says they also need to look at changing the way they actually train the officers  to search the morbidly obese, possibly also adding handheld metal detectors. 
[03:17:00]  Of course.  The morbidly obese.  When do you get morbidly obese?  What number?  I don't know.  There's a line between, like, you're obese, and then you just step over a line, and it  just goes into morbidity.  What's the actual definition of morbidly obese?  I don't know.  I want to know now.  What's the number?  What's the number?  He rocks.  He rocks.  He's not morbidly obese.  He's just obese. 
[03:17:30]  His tweets about the fucking plane and helicopter drove me nuts.  He's terrible.  Worst reporter ever.  He was right there.  What the fuck?  He's fucking horrendous with his fucking bra marks.  Can we read some of his tweets from the big weekend as the big reporter?  He really thought people were just going to be glued to his tweets.  He lives on the Hudson River on the other side in Jersey, and this thing happened pretty  much right outside his front door.  So he was able to get down in this park that was in the area immediately. 
[03:18:00]  He was right there on the scene.  So he got excited and started tweeting like crazy.  I bought into it, and I told a lot of people to follow E-Rock for breaking news.  And then I had to turn off my Twitter.  I was so embarrassed that I told people to go to E-Rock.  The one where he says, here's a picture of them pulling a dead body out of the water,  and there was nothing in the picture.  Nothing.  He hasn't been on the air to defend himself yet, right?  Danny, you got some of the better tweets from the weekend?  Well, I have all of them here. 
[03:18:30]  Start from the beginning.  Yeah, he starts at 8.39 on August 8th.  It was in the morning, this thing?  Yeah, oh, I'm sorry.  9.54.  9.54 a.m.  Oh, so this happened in the morning this whole crash.  I didn't know that.  Okay.  Was he just happen to be around?  Of course he was.  Fucking...  What else has he got going on?  Oh, he's walking down the hall slow.  He's not happy.  Why is his big pink nipples heavy?  Slow fade nips.  See if he's got bra at those bra marks.  You see if Tracy Lords can come in.  Let's see if he's got those bra marks under his... 
[03:19:00]  Hi, E-Rock.  Go ahead, Danny.  Anthony wants to see if he has bra marks under your breast.  I got to go for him.  Oh.  I got to go for him.  Well, the first tweet here says,  Great.  Two planes collide over the Hudson between Hoboken and NYC.  I'm not making it home anytime soon.  Oh, poor E-Rock.  In the helicopter.  No, I was on the belt going to the battery tunnel.  So why wouldn't you be home soon?  Exactly.  Where do you live in the Hudson?  Because I just turned on the radio and they said that it happened, 
[03:19:30]  so I didn't know how long ago that it happened.  Where were you going at that hour?  I was coming back into the city.  And how is something crashing in the Hudson going to affect you?  On the belt.  On the LIE.  Why wouldn't you get home anytime soon when you're going to Manhattan from the east?  Because they said Hoboken and you come out of the tunnel right at Hoboken.  All right.  So it's a tunnel, though.  It's under, you know, it's under the action.  Yeah, exactly.  Yeah.  It's underneath everything.  I'm not going to be home anytime soon.  It's probably the best place to be.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Where do you think you were?  Because you don't have, like, rubberneckers and stuff. 
[03:20:00]  You're in a tunnel underneath the action.  Yeah.  All right.  Go ahead.  Back to Danny.  More tweets?  Yeah.  Go ahead.  Well, about nine minutes later.  Correction.  Plane and helicopter.  Ah.  So I should be home on time.  See, because that makes no sense, too.  Well, 30 minutes later, he made it because it says, came through the battery.  West side is flooded with media and emergency.  Pics soon.  Ah, now everybody's going, all right. 
[03:20:30]  Fuck the news.  I got a guy on the scene.  I got E-Rock radio.  It's going to be Twittering pics.  And this is why E-Rock's not going to make it home on time, because you were going to  stop and take photographs.  Right.  Well, he did make it home because 11, 16 a.m.  Watching it from Hoboken now.  Can't find my damn camera.  Uh-oh.  Why would you be able to?  What happened to your camera?  I left it at my brother's house.  Don't you have a camera on your phone?  Yeah, but that's what I took all those shitty photos to.  There's a fucking helicopter crash, and the one time you don't have your camera. 
[03:21:00]  I know.  You're a fool.  You're a fool.  Well, we can continue.  All right.  Plane slash copter crash.  So now we're just getting the recap, in case you've been missing the E-Rock tweets.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Okay.  Emergency on West Side Highway.  Close as I could get.  And then there's a link to a picture.  All right.  What does the picture look like?  Let's take a look.  It's a hot dog.  Be honest, Danny.  Be honest.  Well, it's fire trucks.  And a car or two. 
[03:21:30]  It's really very uneventful.  It looks like...  Posterous.  It looks like...  Get over there.  They closed it off.  It looks like they took a picture of it.  You took a picture of a fucking trees and fire trucks.  Fire trucks.  It was a water problem.  How old are you?  Seven?  It looks like the Greenlawn Fireman's Fair.  You should have at least got a boat in the water somewhere.  I know.  I wasn't near the water yet.  It looks like a St. Patrick's Day parade in Florida.  That's the St. Patrick's Day parade.  I can't even tell if this is New York.  It looks like it could be Florida.  It looks like from the battery up to, like, 30 on the West Side Highway. 
[03:22:00]  All right.  Can't blame them for one bad picture.  Get a picture of some trucks.  Fire trucks.  So it's setting up.  Yeah.  You know, it's got to set up for the big one.  Oh, what?  I wish I was following Iraq at 12, 12 p.m.  Oh, shit.  Because they just pulled a body out.  All I saw was tan or beige.  No idea, man or woman.  But here's a pic.  Oh.  Here's a pic of a body.  This has got to be gross.  Oh!  Did you put a warning?  Did you put a warning?  Fuck!  Let me see.  Oh, nice.  Take off that postcard of the Hudson River. 
[03:22:30]  I want to see Iraq's body picture.  Where's the body, Iraq?  You could see the body.  The phone didn't really capture it, but you saw it as they pulled it out of the water.  Point it out with your finger.  Where is the dead body?  Wait here.  Jimmy, explain the picture we're looking at before he tries to point out the body.  It's 80% lake.  There's three small ships and buildings in the back.  It's a fucking postcard.  It's a majestic postcard.  Three boats on the Hudson River with buildings in the back.  Greetings.  Yeah.  All right.  Where's the body?  That was a great take from the Hubble.  Where's he pointing?  Somewhere near ship number one. 
[03:23:00]  It couldn't be unclear.  At this point, the body was just lifted off this little black boat right to the end of  the police boat.  Oh, good.  So he's on the boat.  So we're supposed to be able to see over the ledge.  Danny, can you blow that picture up?  Could you pull it over?  I know with Postura's photos, you click on them and they get bigger.  Yeah.  Iraq.  There we go.  Nice and bloated up there.  Oh, wow.  Okay.  Oh, there it is.  That's Fred.  I know who he is.  What the fuck is the body?  He lived in Schenectady.  I still don't know.  By the way, because it's at the end of the show, we let the camera jokes go, but boy, 
[03:23:30]  the listeners certainly have it.  You want a few of these?  Sure.  All right.  Did you search your fat rolls for the camera?  Too many people to give credit on that one.  That is the joke coming in right now.  Oh, shit.  And then someone dog shit sniffers suggesting, Iraq, keep your camera in your fridge.  You'll never lose it.  All right.  That's as close as we can get. 
[03:24:00]  All right.  Back to.  That's blown up 200,000 times and I still can't see anything.  That looks like spring break.  How the fuck was I supposed to show the body with a zoom on a camera phone?  How about you say I don't have a picture of the body?  Don't you understand the problem?  You go, wow, they're pulling a dead body out of the huts and then there's a link to a picture.  We expect dead body.  Did you look at the picture before you wrote the post?  No.  Say, here's water.  No?  I'm busy.  I'm watching them pull the body out.  It's like, here's a body.  Let me just randomly hit a picture of boats.  They pull the first body out. 
[03:24:30]  They drag it up.  Where?  We don't know still.  It's right somewhere in that black blob there.  There's no indication.  You mean Atari basketball that you're pointing to?  Yeah, exactly.  Look how pixelated it is.  I love how he got really mad.  He goes, it's right.  And then realized himself, oh yeah, there's just garbage there.  That could be anything.  All right.  Any more tweets there, Danny?  Oh, there's plenty of tweets.  Swamp gas.  Let's see.  Let's see.  Oh, in the same minute.  There's a lot of tweets happening.  Wow.  Same minute.  Some press stuff. 
[03:25:00]  Black box was retrieved.  Yeah, the mayor just showed up.  And another photo.  Oh, it must be the black box.  What's the photo of?  Of the black box?  Is that Bloomberg?  The first press conference they're holding there.  That's a press conference.  Is that Bloomberg?  No.  No, why would it be?  What mayor is it?  Just a guy, a bunch of people looking at him.  The acting mayor of Hoboken.  Oh, wow.  That's just like getting Mayor Bloomberg.  Bloomberg, yeah.  The acting mayor of Hoboken.  He's the acting mayor.  Exactly.  The girl in the blue right there.  We don't even know who it is.  Wait, that's the acting mayor? 
[03:25:30]  Yeah, the original mayor got arrested.  Yeah, with that.  Oh, right.  With that whole thing that was going on.  Dawn Zimmer, I think her name is.  No.  Is she all right?  I can't say.  I already forgot her name.  It's amazing.  One stayed over.  No one knows Dawn Zimmer.  Nah.  Yeah.  Why would we?  And then the governor showed up a little bit.  Yeah.  Do you got a picture of that?  I tried to get a picture with him.  Yeah, I got one already.  Welcome to the club.  Now, do you have a picture of him?  No.  The security said no and to get away.  No photos of him?  No.  No photos with him.  Oh.  Yeah, of course.  Wow. 
[03:26:00]  Any other tweets there, Danny?  Of course.  Okay.  There's been a fucking aircraft disaster, and you want to do a photo shoot with the governor.  Yep.  Hey, could Corzine throw up a gang sign for me?  Well, this one just says, search and rescue on the Hudson.  Cool.  This must be a really intense photo.  There's a picture, too, so.  Yeah, I want to see this.  Of nothing that resembles search and rescue.  It's a dock and more water, but it's farther away.  Good thing you backed up to take this one.  It's the Staten Island Ferry.  It's the closest you can get.  That is the same thing.  It's just a postcard.  Again.  What? 
[03:26:30]  You can get that picture any day of the week.  You know that, right?  Oh, you can take two pictures?  Did you take binoculars, turn them backwards, and then put the lens against it?  This one's a lot better.  How far can you go with an iPhone or a BlackBerry?  Apparently not more than three miles, which is what you tried.  Are you getting mad that we're pointing out your shitty pictures?  No, I know they're shitty, but I mean, I couldn't get any closer to it, so I just described  what everybody else was seeing.  Here's what we're saying is, I could go out right now and take that picture.  There's constantly police boats on the river.  Sure.  There's nothing happening there. 
[03:27:00]  That's when they were pulling up bodies.  All right?  They weren't pulling up bodies.  Danny, we got to be done with the tweets from E-Rock Radio.  What are you, crazy?  No.  All right, well, there's no picture on this one, but it says, hold on, Bert from Buffalo.  I bet E-Rock's lunch is in a black box.  Sorry, E-Rock.  Well, he's very informative.  They're getting in position to attempt to raise the helicopter.  Just overheard that there, they are, could be someone still in helicopter on shore. 
[03:27:30]  Well, the odds are pretty good.  Ah, ah, ah.  Yeah.  Well, I guess.  You need to learn which there is the proper there.  Yeah, well, when you're typing fast, you're still...  Did he put T-H-E-I-R?  No, he put T-H-E-Y apostrophe R-E.  For what?  They are.  For there could be someone still in helicopter.  So they are could be someone in helicopter?  Yeah, I typed it wrong, all right.  They are someone could be...  They are is, uh...  I'm not allowed to comment.  That's all I know.  Well, I may have a problem with a few of those words now. 
[03:28:00]  There is, uh...  That T-O and T-O-O.  Oof.  That's a rough one.  T-O-O is also.  Yeah, I know.  Yeah.  That's all.  Sometimes it just feels good to do it.  Two is go to hell.  Go to hell.  I never make those mistakes with there or two.  No, you're very...  Never.  Jimmy's very smart.  In high school, I was voted, boy, least likely to mix up twos or theirs.  Sort of niche.  Sure was. 
[03:28:30]  They wouldn't put it in the yearbook.  You got another tweet?  Because I mixed up cunt with girlfriend a lot.  Yes, Danny.  Well, on the instant feedback, C-Rock in Ottawa says, search and rescue for E-Rock.  It would be to find his penis under those wrinkles.  Anyway, so...  But back to the E-Rock tweets.  Sad.  Some lady observer just told Fox News, quote,  quote, this probably isn't as big an operation as the last crash  because B people survived last time.  WTF. 
[03:29:00]  You should proofread these things before you hit that button.  What was he trying to say?  I don't know.  No, the lady was saying that this wasn't...  You're thinking he said lady...  What did you say?  Lady spokesman?  No, the lady spoke to some reporter saying that this probably isn't as big a deal  because on the last one there were survivors.  There wasn't survivors on this one.  Oh, so it's not that big a deal.  Sold hat to her.  Oh, this is going to be a good fucking photo.  All right.  What does it say?  Cool.  Another body.  Best I could do.  Holy shit. 
[03:29:30]  Now this is the best he can do.  So this has to be good.  Another body.  Turn it slow because I get grossed out.  Yeah, they had a floating stretcher and everything for the second body.  Let me say.  You sure?  Let's see.  How can you see from here?  Oh, my God.  Jesus, E-Rock.  What the fuck?  It's the same picture as the first one.  It's the same.  I cannot tell the difference between that picture and the first one.  Yes, you can.  The caption tells you the difference right up there.  Where's the dead body in this picture?  The dead body is being pulled up on this boat right there.  They laid out this floating stretcher thing that they lay the body on and then pull it 
[03:30:00]  up.  Which four pixels represent the body?  Yeah.  Those four right there.  That is, this is the worst reporting on a fucking plane crash ever.  Your reporting really is a disappointment.  Really?  The pictures are terrible.  They're terrible.  We're two minutes into it now.  They're fucking terrible.  All right.  Well, you can point all you want.  Yeah.  It's there.  We're still going to see it.  All right.  We'll take your word for it.  It's there.  Any other, Danny?  You didn't see the arms like you saw on the first body. 
[03:30:30]  I didn't see the arms in any of them.  I didn't see any of the arms in the first body.  Any arms?  The hull of the ship.  Well, there's more tweets if you guys want.  Oh, yeah.  Well.  Well, this one says, they're finding slash found parts of the plane on Sinatra Drive,  a tire and a small part of the landing gear.  Did you see this?  Yeah.  Let's see a picture.  No picture.  Why would there be?  Why not?  If you saw it.  You saw it, but you didn't get a picture.  I couldn't get close enough to get a photo of that one.  Nah, of course.  But your eyes could catch it.  Not like the other ones where you were pretty close.  No, there were better photos online, so I didn't bother. 
[03:31:00]  Yeah, why do it for your followers?  Well, two minutes later, because I guess everybody got bored  of the landing gear tweet.  Is there a trend for this crash on Twitter?  What should I be posting?  Someone send me the number sign.  Somebody was sending me messages like, you should be putting this in a trend,  so I didn't know what the trend was.  Oh, wow.  Shit.  Apparently the trend was to post worthless things.  So then he trends Hudson River.  More plane pieces washing up in Hoboken. 
[03:31:30]  No pictures?  No picture.  Not why.  Why would there be?  Oh, there's supposed to be.  Nope.  20 minutes later, there is, I think the NJ governor just showed up.  Oh.  No pictures.  No.  No, you don't want the governor or the plane parts.  Get the fucking lady from Hoboken.  No, there was photos of those.  The lady.  Yeah, the lady spokesman and the eight mile away fucking ships.  It was a lady observer, James.  Closing the park now.  My guess, they're bringing bodies this way. 
[03:32:00]  Or wreckage.  Why are you guessing?  Because that's what the cops were saying.  That's why they wanted you out of the park.  Oh.  Oh.  Why would they bring the bodies to the park?  Because they found one of them was closer to Hoboken than towards New York City,  so they were going to use that park area.  Why wouldn't they just bring it to the hospital morgue?  I don't know.  The FBI showed up and the cops just moved everyone out.  The FBI's right here are fucking blithering idiots.  That's pretty good, though, Iraq.  You shouldn't throw his gums. 
[03:32:30]  That was pretty brilliant.  Off-the-cuff stuff right there.  Fucking good.  That's brilliant.  Oh, are we done, Dan?  No.  Oh.  Oh, please say we are.  Jesus.  Yes.  Well, this one's two minutes later from the last one.  Ugg.  Ugg.  Ugg.  Imposterous or posterous, whatever.  It's slow-posting photos.  More are coming to know when they'll show up.  Yeah, they showed up later up here.  Well, then after that, it's okay.  Overhearing that they're using, using spelled U-S-E-I-N-G. 
[03:33:00]  Hoboken side to maybe pull the helicopter later.  No pictures.  Later on, park is closed.  This is my favorite one, I think.  Police sectioning off entire park.  Some media being allowed to stay on park's edge.  Sirius XM business card doesn't cut it.  Oh.  Jesus.  What would you even do there if they let you stay?  I did.  I wound up sneaking in.  But I was just hanging out watching everything.  But what is your, like, why do you feel that you needed to be connected to this in some way? 
[03:33:30]  I don't.  I had nothing else to do.  It was right there.  I don't blame him that he was right there.  We all know Iraq loves tragedy.  I blame him for not getting any good photos.  Okay, I picked up someone's cable and walked where the media is.  I'm allowed to stay, comma, I'm helping.  I picked up some of the cable for WNBC floor.  I just kind of walked in with them.  Nobody said anything, so I stayed.  Nice. 
[03:34:00]  This is riveting.  Oh, there's plenty more.  All right, I think you get the point.  There's plenty.  It's 10.30.  We still have at least 15 to 20 tweets left.  Oh, my God.  Are you serious?  Yeah.  I'll go through them quick if you want.  Yeah, go ahead.  Fox News reporter annoyed she has to keep retaking Black, so I guess he was photographing some  reporter.  Here, NJ Governor.  Let's see what the photo is there.  Oh, there you go.  No, she was annoyed.  I like that tweet.  She was annoyed because her hair was in the way or something.  Yeah, she had to keep retaking.  Yeah, because her hair was blowing in her face. 
[03:34:30]  Right.  And then she was adjusting her underwear from the front later on.  Oh, good.  Everybody was just watching her.  Nice.  Here, more.  Twat huggers.  This one says, believed to be more plain pieces.  This is what the cops said, and this is why they closed the, because these pieces started  to rub.  What is that?  Just like our Quiznos wrappers.  Fiberglass.  It's curved.  That could be your toilet bowl at home.  I know.  There's no scale.  With a couple pieces of paper in it.  We have no idea.  They just started washing up on the rocks there, so they closed the park.  But when you take a picture like that, you need some kind of scale.  That could be a space photo. 
[03:35:00]  Right.  It looks like Antarctica from space.  Yeah.  It's nothing like fucking plane wreckage.  You need scale in photos like that.  Give me a wing picture.  Something.  That is unbelievably bad.  I should have just dove in and got a photo with it then.  Yes, you should have.  Oh, please.  As the fucking thing was falling, you should have tried to catch it.  A cannonball to make a tsunami over on the left side.  Toxic boy from Norfolk.  Sirius XM business card doesn't cut it.  Douche chill.  Oh.  Are we done, Dan?  No, because Eric has to take a break from this legitimate reporting that he's doing. 
[03:35:30]  For lunch?  There is a lady with a cowboy hat with a mic that says, quote, NTV in front of a camera.  What network is that?  Seriously.  Keep it clean, folks.  You're right, dude.  I know what he meant.  Don't know if news has this already, so this is an exclusive, I guess.  Oh, an EROC radio exclusive.  Oh, wow.  Hearing the helicopter people, family from Italy, the rest are shopping in NYC.  Police trying to track down. 
[03:36:00]  Phone died.  But new battery.  Rescue called off.  We'll resume at 7 a.m. tomorrow for recovery from what is being said here.  Where did you find your new battery?  You ran home and got it?  No.  I had, uh...  Just happened to have a spare battery for your phone?  No, the plug in the car.  The phone charger in the car.  Yeah.  So this whole thing, I'm just looking here. 
[03:36:30]  It started at...  The tweeting started at 9.54.  Now we're at 3.42.  So this is a big day for Eric.  Six hours.  Yeah.  And not one helpful bit of information.  Nothing.  Or a photo.  Well, Eric asks, what network is this?  She's speaking jibber-jabber, so I'm guessing something European.  And then there's a photo, so let's take a look.  This is like your old bit, what the F. 
[03:37:00]  Oh, I love what the F.  Yeah, there's all these...  When are you bringing back what the F, EROC?  Oh, I forgot about that.  Can you bring back what the F, please?  There's a lot going on in the news.  You should be ready for a good what the F.  What was a what the F?  What was one?  I forgot those.  I forgot, too.  What the F was one of the...  What the fuck is with pennies?  Who is this damn anybody?  Give us one of your old what the Fs.  For real, I don't remember.  One of them was what the F.  Oh, crap.  It was orange drink tastes like orange, but grape tastes different depending on who makes it.  Why doesn't...  I'm forgetting it now. 
[03:37:30]  It was something about those stupid little fruit drinks with the silver peel, where orange  always tastes like orange, no matter who makes it, but the grape and cherry always taste  different.  I've never wanted a gun as badly as I do right now.  It always ends with what the F.  What the F?  It starts what the F, then he does his what the F, and then it ends with what the F.  What the F?  The exclamation point is what the F at the end.  All right.  Thanks, EROC.  Yeah.  It's fantastic.  Of course, there's probably tons more.  I mean, there's more tweets. 
[03:38:00]  Don't you want to know how this ends?  No, there's nothing important.  Jimmy's leaving the studio.  He didn't even say he was leaving.  He just got up and left.  But they found some kind of a ring at a building near Sinatra Little League Field.  What kind of ring?  I don't know.  There's no picture.  Wait, like a ring on the ground like a UFO ring or a ring finger type ring?  Or like an engagement ring or something.  Some kind of ring from the plane.  Oh, a ring from the plane.  People are packing up, EROC.  Hey, wait.  This one sounds good.  I think this might be the crescendo here. 
[03:38:30]  A last shot.  Two orange floats.  That's the helicopter.  Where are you going?  Don't you want to see it?  Yeah.  Dude, check this out.  Check out the orange floats, dude.  All right.  No fucking way.  Yeah, dude.  There's nothing there.  They're there.  No.  They're there.  They're there.  I saw them.  They're not there.  I don't know why I didn't show up there, but they're there.  They're right in the center.  There's nothing there.  There's nothing there.  That's where the helicopter is, was.  It's not. 
[03:39:00]  It's calm water.  Which there did you use, by the way?  Exactly.  T-H-E-R-E.  Nice.  They are there.  T-H-E-I-R.  There.  There.  There.  Everybody should be following Big Duties on Twitter.  I-E-S and Duties, because I have a feeling that there's going to be some major shit going on today.  Is that you, EROC?  Big Duties?  No.  I have a feeling there's going to be some big news outside of my house today.  Big news.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  Oh, definitely.  What?  What happened? 
[03:39:30]  I don't know.  I just get a bad vibe.  Yeah.  Probably will be.  You should probably follow me all day today.  Is this inside shit?  Oh, I will.  What are you talking about?  I have to go.  My agent has birthday gifts for me.  I can just see a scene of where there was a big car wreck here.  Quiet Street.  Oh, I see.  Ah.  Take care, guys.  Yeah.  Yeah.  All right, Jimmy.  See you tomorrow.  Wow, EROC.  No, that was good.  That was riveting.  I wasn't following, which sucks.  Ending the show strong.  All good.  Yeah, that's what we always achieve, or try to achieve, and failed miserably today. 
[03:40:00]  Yeah.  No, no.  Worst of the week content.  This is great.  Good stuff.  Oh, you think this is going to make...  Oh, yeah.  This will be top five.  Saturday?  Mm-hmm.  Nice.  Oh, hold on.  I got to unplug this.  Ah, let me get this plug.  There we go.  Oh, my God.  Stop touching my stuff.  Right there.  Hey, you're tearing my card.  Two orange floats.  Orange floats. 
[03:40:30]  That's what you had for fucking lunch.  Oh, that'd be delicious.  Did the orange taste like orange?  Yes, it did.  Were there grape floats next to it?  But they're always different.  Cherry floats taste different.  See, it all relates.  It all relates.  It all works around.  It all goes back to food.  Can we go home now?  Yes.  Yeah, let's get the fuck out of here, man.  I got a pool to swim in.  Yeah, Ann has a pool.  I have to swim in.  Exactly.  I obviously don't have a pool to swim in. 
[03:41:00]  Yes, you do.  No, I don't.  You got an open invite.  No, I don't.  Hey, for you, the door is open.  Actually, for everybody, it is.  I'm having a new door put in.  I actually felt good about myself for a second.  Now anyone can walk in your front door today.  Exactly.  Oops.  Only day you tell me I got an open door.  Open door policy at my house.  All right, guys.  It was fun for a Monday.  We'll see you tomorrow.  Yeah.  Yeah. </pre>
