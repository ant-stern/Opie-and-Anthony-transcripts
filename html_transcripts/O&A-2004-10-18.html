<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast covered a wide range of topics, often transitioning abruptly between them.  The show opened with a discussion of the Red Sox-Yankees playoff game, focusing on the Red Sox victory, the "Who's your daddy?" chant from Boston fans, A-Rod's home run and the subsequent ball-throwing incident, and the game's late finish.  The hosts and producer Ben detailed their illnesses with graphic descriptions and vulgar language.  Guest Jimmy Norton joined the broadcast, contributing to the discussion of their respective ailments in similarly explicit terms.

The conversation then shifted to their experience at the Donald Trump Friar's Club roast, criticizing the performances, seating, and Cheryl Tiegs' appearance using vulgar language.  Listener calls followed, covering topics ranging from the baseball game to a bizarre request to postpone a father's burial until after the Super Bowl,  inappropriate voicemail messages, and items being sold on eBay related to the show (including a fake Jim Norton herpes test). The segment ended with a debate about the "queef" sound effect.

The show then delved into a discussion surrounding the potential revival of their "Most Offensive Song Contest," featuring extremely offensive song titles like "I'm Horny for Little Girls," "Baby Raper," and "Full Blown AIDS."  This led into the "Sucks to Be You" segment, showcasing listener calls detailing various unfortunate and often absurd real-life incidents, including a man who died retrieving his hearing aid from train tracks and a man who fell into hot tar. One caller, Nina from Tennessee, masturbated on air while discussing sexually explicit dreams about Jimmy Norton.  A listener song composed entirely of words from Jimmy Norton's blog, describing a bizarre incident involving inducing vomiting by smelling a belly button, was also played.  The hosts debated the difference between "Sucks to Be You" and "Unlucky Lottery," and the segment concluded with further discussion of the "Most Offensive Song Contest,"  plans for listener submissions, and a discussion regarding procuring women for a wiffle ball bat challenge, focusing on those involved in pornography or with drug addictions, alongside a discussion of pictures of Maria Schneider from *Last Tango in Paris*.


The next segment began with a discussion of an urban legend about a transsexual prostitute, segueing into conversations about obtaining illicit photos and Howard Stern's use of the term "balloon knot."  The hosts then launched into a conspiracy theory about government persecution, peppered with sexual innuendos and jokes targeting Robin Quivers.  Audio clips from a British radio program, "Fag Talk," and listener-submitted audio were played.  The "Unlucky Lottery"/"Sucks to Be You" segment continued with listener stories, including a fatal amusement park accident at a church fair involving intellectually disabled students, and a darkly humorous discussion of the mortician's challenges. The hosts also discussed a $5,000 Japanese robot and received a call from a trucker discussing the spread of the "ONA virus" among truckers.  Another caller requested the return of a colostomy bag left at the studio. A "Megabyte Minute" segment about a man golfing across Mongolia was inserted. The show continued with recollections of a Godsmack and Metallica concert, a discussion about the Lifetime channel and the movie *Goodfellas*, and reflections on marriage, parenthood, and relationships, all punctuated by further vulgar humor, listener calls, and audio bits.


The final segment featured the "What Did We Learn?" bit, where callers shared absurd and often offensive statements learned from the show, including "the only good morning sex is morning sex," "soap on the teeth leads to monster rain," and "ass munching is making a comeback."  A French-accented caller from New Jersey contributed extensively to the vulgar conversation.  There was a discussion about Opie's "hot teen news" segment and a caller's bizarre dream about his penis resembling a pizza.  The segment concluded with another brief advertisement for "Megabyte Minute."  Throughout the entire broadcast, the language used was consistently vulgar and offensive.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  Oh, let's strike that one more down 
[00:00:30]  We'll be right back 
[00:01:00]  We'll be right back 
[00:01:30]  We'll be right back 
[00:02:00]  We'll be right back 
[00:02:30]  We'll be right back 
[00:03:00]  We'll be right back 
[00:03:30]  We'll be right back 
[00:04:00]  We'll be right back  We'll be right back 
[00:04:30]  We'll be right back 
[00:05:00]  We'll be right back 
[00:05:30]  Oh my God, that feels so good 
[00:06:00]  Oh yeah, I'll throw it out  Oh yeah, oh yeah  Who's your daddy?  Who's your daddy?  Oh my God  Oh yeah, play with my boys, play with my boys  And that's what they're saying in Boston and that's what they're saying in Boston this morning 
[00:06:30]  Like, don't move, I'll say in the night, don't move, don't move, I'll go get yourProfes, don't move, I'll go get you a towel  And that's what they're saying in Boston this morning  Anthony. First of all, I am shocked. Wow. Dopey bastards making us stay up to 1.30 in  the morning when I got to be up at 3.30. Yeah, it's probably people that were responsible  and went to bed very early. Who? Yeah, that's true. Not a Yankee or Sox fan. I was going 
[00:07:00]  to say, I guess anyone that wasn't really interested in the game. I went to bed at 10  o'clock. You did? Yeah, I was staying up to watch the Red Sox and Yankees go at it last  night. I figured, you know, I'll check out the game. 10 o'clock, I'm like, you know  what? This is just stupid. What am I doing to myself? Stupid to stay away. I go to bed.  Who knew that the game would take another three and a half hours to complete? After 12 innings,  the Sox beat the Yankees 6-4 on David Ortiz's homer, Anthony. You know what? Yeah. They 
[00:07:30]  finished nine innings. It's tied. Could go either way. You know? Extra innings, it goes  either way. Who knows? But for the Boston Herald to put Sox, show them who's daddy on  the cover, slow down, Sox fans. Slow down. So you take one. It ain't a four-game sweep.  But, you know, it's like being a convicted or someone who's on death row and cheering that  you're getting such a good meal. You know? Oh, look, I got a steak. You know how this is 
[00:08:00]  going to end? I don't know about that. Oh, stop it. You guys got to get through Pedro  Martinez today. So? And they're going to, like, duct tape Kurt Schilling's ankle back  together. Oh, is that what they're going to do? You're going to have to get past him  again. We can rebuild him. I'm already looking at Game 7. It looks like it's going to be  Game 7 here in New York, Anthony. You're going to look at Game 7. Not between the Yankees  and the Red Sox. That's for sure. Three more, guys. Three more in a row. Stop it. Did you watch 
[00:08:30]  Saturday's game? That's why they lost yesterday. They were exhausted from slamming that ball.  Yeah, what was the score Saturday? 38-5? What was it? It was 19-8. And everything sounds  better with teen at the end. So it was 19-8-teen. They got spanked. I guess they were a bit  tired. They're jumping around after they win in extra innings last night. They're jumping 
[00:09:00]  around on the field like they won the goddamn World Series. And all the news reports, you  got the fans up there in Boston, you know, doing the Who's Your Daddy chant at 1.30 in  the morning. Oh, stop it. We just saw the news. They were saying a Boston fan's still  partying. Yeah, they had local sports guy Bruce Beck up there in Boston. Like they need  any excuse to party up in Boston. Well, Boston Red Sox fans stopped partying only an hour and  a half ago. Yeah. The bars close up there when? Two? No. Well, yeah, two. Some of them  close at two. Yeah, but you know they're just on the street drinking. Yo, Sully, you want 
[00:09:30]  another beer? How funny was it when Jeter, no, A-Rod hit that home run over the green monster  and they kept throwing it back into the freaking... Threw it back. Into the park. And then they  threw it back out. And then Tarzan threw it back over and then they threw it back. That  was hilarious. That was pretty funny. And then the ump wrecked everyone's fun. Goes  trotting. I'll take this. Goes trotting out into left field with his big beer belly, grabs  the ball and then spoils everyone's fun. You know, the Sox fans, though, you got to understand 
[00:10:00]  this is just prolonging the agony. It's inevitable. You guys got spanked on Saturday, man. And  last night's game, it was one of those close games that could have gone either way. First  one, you know, you guys have had with us in this series. Please, don't worry about it. We'll  talk tomorrow. All right. We'll talk tomorrow, all right? Am I going to have to stay up late  again? No, no, luckily today. What time does the game start? Five? Five? That means the 
[00:10:30]  game will be over by midnight, so that's good news. Although they say the game starts at  like 7.30 and it winds up starting at 8.30 and they bamboozle you. I don't know why they  have to start these games so late. Knowing that, you know, in the playoffs especially, these  games slow way down. They ought to arrest everyone that was at Fenway last night with  children. Did you see some of these kids? They can't keep their eyes open. They're drooling,  falling asleep. It's like you can't, you can't even take your kid to the game. I thought you 
[00:11:00]  were describing Ben because he's going to be useless today. He's going to be absolutely  useless. He's like, dude, you know I'm a huge Sox fan, so I had to stay up and watch the  game. I mean, he's supposed to be producing this radio show, right? I'm like, yeah, you  know, you got to give it to him. I kind of understand, but he also had to go to a bar  and watch the game until 1.30 tomorrow. Of course. We had to win one. I want to thank  all my great friends in Boston that have called me from 1.30 to 3, reminding me that we won. 
[00:11:30]  And you know how it is, Hope. I'm not making this up. When you used to crash in my apartment,  my friends just, I have to get up in a half an hour. Thanks for letting me know that we  won. They were all pissed because the bars closed at 2. They went in a half an hour to get  out to the bars. Ben, don't you realize you were that guy too? You would call people at  all hours? Yes, yes. I'm sure you would have been calling me up going, ah, we kicked your  ass. I didn't call anyone last night. When we first moved back to Boston, I started getting  sick of the commute, so I started staying at Hotel Ben. It's Hotel Ben because all of Ben's 
[00:12:00]  friends from Boston that decide they need to have a life in New York, they move down here  and they start at Hotel Ben for about a week or two. And then they finally get their own  apartment and move on, right? Well, I was one of these guys that did Hotel Ben for a while,  and he's not kidding. His friends call him all night long. All hours. All night long,  he's got drunken friends from all over the East Coast calling up Ben to see what he's up  to. Yeah. Well, last night, you know, it was just unbelievable. Dave, dude, dude, it's great.  We're going to take him. We're going to win this thing. I'm like, dude, let's be realistic 
[00:12:30]  here. It's three to one. Three more in a row, guys. That's all you need. It ain't going  to happen. Did you forget the three, the spankings you got prior? Did you forget? I didn't  forget. I'm the only one, only one that has any idea that we are not going to win  this. It's impossible. Thank you. I'm glad there's a realistic Sox fan here because the  other one, I'm listening to 10-10 wins on the way in and I'm hearing Sox fans going,  the Yankees lose! The Yankees lose! The Yankees... What? What? What happened the previous games, 
[00:13:00]  my friend? All right. It's one game, but you know. They won a game. It's never happened,  first of all, in baseball history. It's never happened... Where someone has come  back from a three-zip deficit. It's never happened before. We understand that. And  the Sox, this hope, this hope that they got last night that they're going to be the team  that does it, the team that chokes, that chokes every year, stop it. All right, you get  through Pedro and then we'll talk, all right? Where's the problem there? You're going to take 
[00:13:30]  Carapagio tonight? Yes. Or this afternoon? Yes. All right. I'll tell you one thing, though.  Got to watch that game in high definition. I am the biggest fan of high definition. Opie,  how long have I been doing radio? Ten years. Professionally? Professionally. Maybe three.  And how long have I been... Ten years, yes. How long has it been a lucrative career for me? 
[00:14:00]  It's been pretty good for a few years, I guess. Yeah, we finally started making money a few  years back. Do you know when I got a big screen television? No. A month ago. I'm the first  one in my family to have one. Or the last one in my family to have one. So I'm really excited  about it. And I watched the game on the Fox high definition channel. Got to go way up  there. Way up to 710, whatever it is. Well, that's the problem. 705. That's the problem  with high definition TV. You don't know where they broadcast the stuff. I know. It's like 
[00:14:30]  on channel 996-3.2 or something. I was cursing last night. I told my girlfriend, I go, could  you remember what channel this is on? Because I can't ever remember. I'm going through the  channels. I can't get there fast enough. You got to go through all the music channels.  Music channels. Yeah. I don't want to listen to Salsa. Go through jazz. Then I go through  all the NBA channels and everything. Like, where is it? Fox high definition. Then you 
[00:15:00]  get to it. Oh, first of all, you get in the widescreen, which is great. You see the whole  field. It's like the Wizard of Oz when they go to color. When she opens the door and it's  all in color. It's beautiful. And then you could do without the El Duque nostril shot  in high definition. They bring those cameras in. You could see like the crust of snot on  these guys' noses. I don't like that part of it. But the picture, so when are they going 
[00:15:30]  to just go to high definition with everything? It's coming soon. You get the widescreen picture  and it's so clear. And it's the only way to watch the game, man. Unless you're in a  bar with Ben. Because then that's a treat in itself. Ben is shot. And the whole city  of New York is shot. They're all joking on TV about how, oh, we stayed up late. It  was a school night last night. I'm useless. Yeah. So Astros won, of course, and they're 
[00:16:00]  still playing. How cool would it be if it's Clemens in the World Series against the  Yankees? I think that would be pretty cool to check out. That would have worked both  ways. It would have been cool if he was playing against the Sox, too. But that  ain't gonna happen. Just keep those hopes alive, people. Keep them alive. All right.  Well, Jimmy Norton has made his way into the studio. Jimmy! I'm hearing you have the  ass flu. Well, it was a fire alarm went off last night. Now, how did that make you  late? I don't understand. Yeah, man. I feel better today. It's the best I felt. I don't 
[00:16:30]  think, I honestly, I don't think I've slept since I saw you guys. Really? I kept, I tried  to sleep, but every time I would sleep because my throat is swollen. Yeah. I, my fat little  retarded boy tongue. Oh, God, you sound like you have a fat tongue today. It would, it was  actually my, I have to be careful, I can't even talk that much. It would get stuck in  my throat. So every 10 minutes I was waking up going. Oh, and I realized how sick I was 
[00:17:00]  when I left the Trump roast and went home to nap for a couple hours after we saw Voss.  I couldn't sleep. I laid down and I kept every 10 minutes I was waking up. I couldn't either,  but it was Voss's act that kept me awake running through my head. That awful act running through  my head. I kept going, waking up like I had night terrors. Teeth were chasing me. Dodging  her. Dry your doors after me. You look awful. You all right? I feel better now. Thanks. I  mean, you should have said. The sickness has been going around this room. It started with 
[00:17:30]  Anthony. I had it. I'm told, I'm finally a hundred percent today. Yeah. And now it's  your turn. I canceled all shows on Saturday. I had the, uh, the chills on fevers and the  chills. Yeah. And the worst part was trying to shit with the chills. I can't even enjoy  my news week. I'm on the ball. I'm just rattling on the toilet. It's the worst sore throat I've  ever had. You know what's great when you're sick though? Sex. Did you do it? Did you call  him? I didn't even whack my bag since Thursday. Oh, you must have been sick. Did you have fever 
[00:18:00]  sack where it just hangs down like a hot air balloon over a power line? It's just hanging  there. It's so awful. And I had a fever. It was just like click clacks hanging between  my legs. No, it was like a wasp mess under an igloo. It did not at all hang down. No?  It ripped my awful little body. You must have been sick if you haven't whacked your bag since  Thursday. I tried. I actually, the first time I even had an urge was yesterday. So I 
[00:18:30]  was around looking for ads and stuff. But considering the lack of sleep I got, I had a fairly decent  amount of energy. Like I couldn't believe I was eight. I did one set last night. I'm like,  maybe it's because I haven't been whacking my bag. Maybe that's an energy. So I'm like,  don't do it until you're a little bit better. Yeah. A lot of people do that for training  or stuff. They do. Yeah. They won't have sex. They won't have sex. But if you're sick,  it's one of those things like at least for during the time that you're having sex, it makes you  feel better. And then if you, if you, if your girlfriend has a fever, you know, that's 
[00:19:00]  great. That's like, like a hot, hot box. Oh, the two, the two faces are all heated.  All hot. It's like 102 degree sex. It's great. I could, how do you get a rod when you're  that sick? I can't do it, man. It works. Oh, it works. My meal was worthless. I tried  to touch it. It just shrunk between my legs like a mealworm and hid from my little greedy  fingers. Are we going to make it through the show today? I'll be all right. Yeah. I just  can't talk as much. God, we got Ben who's had literally two hours sleep. We got a little 
[00:19:30]  on two hours. I actually, Anthony's on two hours sleep. I was watching most of it was  David Ortiz at the home run. Yeah. The first I, did I tell you Ortiz? The first I heard  the loss was just getting here now. Cause I went to bed in the 11th. I knew they were  going to lose that game. Yeah. I kind of felt it. You know, it was one of those things  that they had it. They got to prolong their agony, the Sox fans and them jumping around  like that. Like, like, like they were one, like it was the seventh game and they won  it. Unbelievable. A lot of excitement in Boston this morning. They make me sick. You know 
[00:20:00]  what they are, the Red Sox? They act like they, they really make it some great, they're  a rape victim that has just picked themselves up the floor because she's been mouth and  ass raped, but they didn't get the badge yet. Like I still feel good about myself. You  understand what I mean? That's exactly what the Red Sox are like this year. All that dignity  will be gone in a second. Don't worry. The Aggies aren't going to sweep. The Boston's  a good team. I mean, but three, three, you know, they feel good about them. I'll say  you're right. I'm surprised that they were able to take three in a row like that. Uh, 
[00:20:30]  the Yankees, I, I, I assume that Boston would, uh, would have won one of those games,  but you know, they, they, they fend off the sweep, but you know, it's just going to happen.  All right. Let's say hi to Amanda. What's up, Amanda? Good morning, guys. Good morning.  Hello. How are you? Pretty good. What's going on today? You can't tell me that you're not  scared about Rivera coming in again. He sucks against Boston. He doesn't do it again.  No, he doesn't suck against Boston. They all want a great job. Don't worry about it.  She's right. There's not. No way. You guys have to be a little bit scared that your invincible 
[00:21:00]  Rivera blows it every time he plays the Red Sox. First of all, who does Boston have that  can balance it? They are one of the only teams that hits them. I would definitely, I'll  definitely give you that. But again, am I more scared about Rivera? Are you more scared  about Pedro, uh, who is probably the biggest gun you have right now who cannot beat the  Yankees? Not in Fenway, though. Not in Fenway. Rivera's not, they beat him in Fenway  last time they played him in Fenway. Rivera's not going to blow every save, but yeah, Boston  does hit him pretty well. They hit him. And they got lucky last night because the game 
[00:21:30]  was so close. That's all. Why can't Boston win three in a row? If the Yankees can win  three in a row, we swept them this year. Because they're not the Yankees. No matter how hard  they try and how much they want to be the Yankees, they're not the Yankees. Yankees rally in  postseason. Even if the season itself wasn't that good, they can rally. The Sox, if they  rule during the season, they will choke in post. It happens year after year. It's just  the way it is. Face it.  It's so bizarre the passion you have for the Yankees because you're just not a sports fan 
[00:22:00]  in general. The only thing you follow is the New York Yankees.  It's pretty much just the Yankees.  All right, Amanda, thank you.  And it wouldn't surprise me if the Yankees lost today and won in games.  You know something? What a treat it would be to bring him back to the stadium and watch  him just annihilate him in front of a New York crowd. I have complete faith.  Derek Lowe pitched a good game considering how miserable he is with that whole rotten organization.  Oh, well, the fans behind him with the D-Lowe chant. How could he lose? 
[00:22:30]  That was a good one. D-Lowe. And then, of course, a carver who I hope dies in some sort  of a bus flip. That biased scumbag. That biased scumbag. He said something about it.  And the Yankees seem to get all the calls. Like, which one? We got a bad call at third  and we got a break yesterday and we got a bad call at last. You know what I mean?  Both teams get crap calls and good calls. It's part of the game.  I love when all these announcers, all their prior resentment for the Yankees comes out.  Like, Joe Morgan, I hate mighty Joe Morgan. I really hate him because he is such a Yankee 
[00:23:00]  hater and he won't admit it. Passive-aggressive douche.  So we haven't seen you since the Donald Trump roast.  Oh, yeah.  And you've been sick ever since with the ass flu.  I think you got sick from the ass.  The ass flu.  I didn't.  I think the ass munching. That's making a huge comeback, we learned last week on the  radio show.  I think that might have got you a little sick.  Nah, baby. I wish it was that, but it really is just a silly sore throat.  Because, I mean, look, other times for ass, that was just, I mean, I was in there for  a couple of seconds. 
[00:23:30]  That's all it takes.  Those germs?  That's all it takes.  You know, there's been times where I've laid on my back, like, say, like a Kansas field.  And you ever see when a nuclear missile is launched out of a Kansas field?  Right. That silo opens up and out of nowhere, here it comes.  Here comes that missile.  Well, picture if the missile just stopped for a few minutes and stood straight up out of  that Kansas field.  I've laid on my bathroom floor with plastic under my head.  If that didn't get me sick, eating this ass, please.  I laugh at this ass.  Well, something got you sick. 
[00:24:00]  Could have been that.  Oh, an ant.  You were both very miserably sick.  I don't remember him eating my ant.  Yeah, I didn't.  But I did lick the ball when you get up.  Maybe it was that fine food at the Donald Trump roast.  Ah.  That was great.  That shindy.  That was...  Hey, Voss, thanks a lot for the seats.  Oswald was closer to Kennedy than that asshole got us to the podium.  Yeah, we were feeling like big shots.  I guess we should get into this.  Did we even tell people Friday we were going to the Donald Trump roast?  No, I wasn't even going to go because I assumed you had to have the suit and tie thing going.  Yeah.  And I didn't have one. 
[00:24:30]  Well, our pal, Rich Voss, thinks he's a big shot these days.  And he got invited to roast Donald Trump with a bunch of other comedians.  How did he get on the dais?  Did you see who else was up there?  How did he get up on the dais?  There were about 50 people on the dais.  Well, the main question about how did Voss go on is because he's not technically a friar.  And, I mean, there's some great New York friar comedians.  I think it's because he's been doing great.  And, you know, he's been on NBC.  And Zucker was one of the host, one of the roasters.  I'm very surprised at who there are that are friars.  When they're announcing on the dais and it's like, 
[00:25:00]  And we introduce friar Kitey Tong.  Yeah.  It's like, what is newswoman Kitey Tong doing as a friar?  He wasn't there, but he's a friar.  Oh, really?  David Dinkins is a friar?  Yeah.  The Lush, we're over-attentioned.  So Voss is like, you know, making sure that we're going to the Donald Trump roast  because it's like $500 a plate, which we didn't have to pay because I wouldn't have paid $500 for that.  No, $500.  Absolutely not.  And I got the ticket.  You know, we get free ticket from Voss.  So we get into our nice little clothes because you've got to look nice for these roasts. 
[00:25:30]  I was wearing a buttoned shirt.  That was pretty much it.  And jeans.  I knew we were in trouble when they said you guys are sitting upstairs.  Yeah.  And you're seeing everyone else go in the main door and like,  Oh, your ticket's, you're upstairs.  Oh, you take the elevator and I'm like, elevator?  Oh, that's never good.  There's no elevator around here.  Up into the balcony.  It was kind of like a service elevator or something to get to our seats, right?  And then we're like, well, at least we're going to be right in the middle, you know, in the balcony  so we can look down and it'll be a nice view.  No.  It was blocked by a big screen TV and a follow spot. 
[00:26:00]  Right.  It's great.  We were pretty much behind the big screen TV that all the people looked up at that had  the really bad seats on the floor.  So they had bad seats.  So the only way they could see the stage is to turn around and see the big screen while  we were behind that big screen.  Behind the big screen.  Unbelievable.  And I couldn't even get Conchita to bring me a drink.  Were there any drinks there?  Ah, there was that awful, awful unwashed staff at that hotel.  Horrible.  They wanted to charge for, like, certain drinks.  Like, they gave you a water or whatever, but, you know, for Cokes for, like, $5. 
[00:26:30]  Come on, man.  It's $500 a plate.  Pay less attention to your daughter's pornographic videotapes and get some waitstaff at your hotels.  So, Jesus Christ.  It was a mediocre roast at best, and everyone had to make fun of Donald Trump's hair because  that's the thing to do.  Uh-huh.  The hair.  Regis was the roast master.  He was the host.  This guy is awful, awful, Geldman.  He couldn't string together two funny words. 
[00:27:00]  Ever.  He's introducing people.  He has no clue who they are, and they were ancient people.  His comebacks, he was horrible.  Awful.  Stewie Stone was great.  I know who he is.  He's a legendary Friars comedian, but I never really watched him work.  The first guy.  Oh, the first guy killed, and then no one could really follow that.  Susie Espin killed right after him.  No, Susie Espin.  Yeah, she was good, too.  That's right.  You're right.  But it just kept going downhill, downhill after that. 
[00:27:30]  All right.  Well, then, Anthony and I had the pleasure of following Cheryl Teagues' ass out of the place.  Oh, Cheryl Teagues was there.  Is she a friar?  I got a picture of her.  Yeah, I know.  Everyone remembers Cheryl Teagues?  She was that hot Sports Illustrated model back in probably, what, the late 70s, I guess?  Late 70s, yeah.  She had that poster that was like the poster to have.  Didn't she have the fishnet?  Fishnet.  She had the fishnet bathing suit for the Sports Illustrated suit.  Yeah, it wasn't even like a top.  You could see her tits right through the fishnet. 
[00:28:00]  Let me tell you, that time is a bitch, and you wouldn't want to see her in any type of fishnet wear whatsoever.  We walk out of the roast, and we're walking down, I guess it was 6th Avenue, and she's in front of us.  Right.  Anthony and I are laughing so hard because we're just following Cheryl Teagues' ass because she had to wear high heels.  She's already a tall lady.  She's got some guy holding her arm to help her walk in her high heels.  That would be the sugar daddy.  Yeah.  No, I think it was like her people. 
[00:28:30]  Oh, really?  I don't think it was a sugar daddy.  I think it was somebody to help her.  They looked like they were kind of dating or something.  That guy was really old.  You don't want her snapping a hip trying to walk on those heels.  So her ass was pretty much eye level because she's tall with the high heels.  It was the worst ass I've ever seen in my life.  Horrible.  Now, she had the most perky, pert little ass back in the day, back in the older days.  Oh, and this thing was like flat, sagging, and had that spread coming out the side. 
[00:29:00]  You know?  Okay, here you go.  At home, do this.  Hold up your hands in front of your face.  So your palms face each other at a distance of about a foot.  Okay?  Make it the distance of a nice ass.  A nice ass.  Now, curve your hands.  Curve them into a nice round ass.  Okay?  All right.  That looks nice.  That's what a nice round ass would look like from looking from behind. 
[00:29:30]  Okay.  I'm with you.  Let's go.  Now, all of a sudden, straighten your fingers out and bend only at your knuckles that are  closest to your palm.  Now, bend.  So it's like an angle.  That's what happens.  Are you doing this at home?  That's what happens to the ass.  They get the points.  They get points that stick out to the side.  It goes from round.  See?  Round.  Out of the points.  She had the points going.  And the flab. 
[00:30:00]  You could see she was wearing very tight black pants, which show every little ripple.  And she had pancake batter on for makeup.  Yeah.  And her ass, through the black pants, looked like a golf ball.  The surface of a golf ball.  Yeah, it wasn't happening.  It was not.  And it's awful, because she was hot.  And then I'm like, oh, isn't this time a bitch?  And then we're looking at Cheryl Teague's ass, Opie.  Finally.  It's a couple of feet away from us, and this is the Cheryl Teague's ass.  Why couldn't we see the Cheryl Teague's ass of the late 70s? 
[00:30:30]  Or even though I would even accept the late 80s.  Late 80s?  Maybe mid-80s.  Don't want to see the Cheryl Teague's ass of 2004.  And then some just...  Average girl.  Average girl is at lunch or whatever.  She bent over on one of the fountains to tie her foot up, to tie her shoe.  And all of a sudden, me and Opie remove our eyes from Cheryl Teague's ass  to look at this average woman's ass as she's bent over, tying her shoe.  And the average woman's ass blew Cheryl Teague's ass away.  This woman can say, I have a better ass than Cheryl Teague's circa 2004. 
[00:31:00]  Sure.  Not the Cheryl Teague's of 1980.  It was...  Time stinks.  It was awful.  Hey, Seth, what's going on?  Hey, guys.  How are you?  Good.  That roast was atrocious.  Absolutely atrocious.  I was there on Friday.  Oh, you are?  Yeah.  The highlight, though, was my wife met little Jimmy outside right before you guys walked in.  You all three walked in together.  All right.  Said she was a fan.  Jimmy stopped.  Oh, thanks, man. 
[00:31:30]  Shook her hand, you know, and said, oh, wow, I appreciate that.  And then walked in.  She looked down and went, eh, and ran to the bathroom.  And I walked in.  I don't blame her, sir.  Some of those comics were just horrific.  And they're legends.  They're legendary.  Norm Crosby.  Good example.  Oh, my God.  I swear to God.  Norm Crosby.  I didn't know it was a comedian.  I swear to God.  I thought it was a guy from Crosby's Tills and Nash.  It would have been funnier. 
[00:32:00]  It would have been funnier.  You must have really had a fever then.  When he walked up, I realized it was a comic.  But no, no.  The name Norm Crosby, I just didn't recognize the name.  When you go to a roast, you could tell a lot of people, like Jeffrey Ross is great at roasts.  And he ate it.  He ate it.  I don't think he ate it.  I thought he had some jokes that didn't hit it.  I think he went on too late.  Maybe, yeah.  I think he would have went on earlier.  I think the audience was too busy looking at themselves in mirrors and stuff.  That wasn't a good job.  Artie Lang did a great job.  Yeah, Artie Lang definitely did a good job.  You could tell he wrote on the fly as things were happening. 
[00:32:30]  He was writing material.  He went up there.  It was like, well, he's now Foster Brooks, but he did a good job.  Foster Brooks.  He had to act like he was completely hammered between every joke.  Right, right.  But it worked for him.  I think he was hammered.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  Yeah.  It wasn't bad.  But Norm Crosby was absolutely awful.  He gets up there, and he's had a roast, so you're supposed to roast, but he's just got  these old jokes, and he's using Donald Trump to seg into these ancient jokes. 
[00:33:00]  He get up there, and he's got the hearing, the speech impediment, of course, of his hearing.  He can't hear, so he's got that.  But he's like, Donald Trump, you know, Donald Trump gives a lot of money to charity.  Charity builds a lot of hospitals.  And, you know, speaking of hospitals, a guy walks into a doctor's office and says, Doc,  give me the bad news.  Doctor replies, you have AIDS.  What could be worse than that, the patient asks.  You've also got Alzheimer's disease.  Looking relieved, the patient says, oh, well, that's not so bad. 
[00:33:30]  At least I don't have AIDS.  You know, but Donald Trump, he's great.  He hires a lot of people, and he's got secretaries.  Mr. Johnson and his secretary are on a train to Paris.  They're just about to go to sleep.  And the secretary, he says, who's got the hots for the boss, says in a seductive voice,  I'm a little cold.  Could I borrow your blanket?  Well, the man says, how would you like to be Mrs. Johnson for a while?  The secretary jumps at the chance and begins to get out of bed.  Then he replies, good.  Then you could get your own damn blanket.  Because Donald Trump's got a secretary. 
[00:34:00]  That's exactly what Norm Crosby was doing.  He just kept doing this over and over.  These hack old jokes and just using the Donald as like a segue.  Unbelievable.  Donald Trump sure gets married a lot, doesn't he?  He had brides and grooms.  You know, he's been married a lot.  A young couple gets married, and the groom asks if the bride...  The groom asks the bride if he can have a dresser drawer of his own that she'll never open.  The bride agrees.  After 30 years of marriage, she knows the drawer's been left open. 
[00:34:30]  She peeks inside and sees three golf balls and $1,000.  She confronts her husband and asks for an explanation.  He explains, every time I was unfaithful to you, I put a golf ball in the drawer.  She figures three times in 30 years isn't bad until...  But what about the $1,000?  He replied, whenever I get a dozen balls, I sold them.  And the Donald likes to play golf.  That's exactly how it went to happen.  It was the worst.  Alright.  Well, we're just getting warmed up.  We've got lots to do today. 
[00:35:00]  Voss didn't do too bad.  He started off slow.  I'll tell you why.  Because, you know, Regis gave him a bad intro, which was kind of a joke.  Who is this guy?  Yeah.  The next act is...  Yeah, exactly.  But Regis was eating his stupid balls the entire roast.  He was bombing the entire roast.  And he was all uncomfortable when everyone would use dirty language.  Because there was a lot of dirty language at the roast.  Filthy.  And he was all...  You know, he'd get up there, oh, oh, oh, well.  A little uncomfortable.  Yeah.  And so Voss started slow. 
[00:35:30]  And then really, you know...  They quoted Voss in the Times.  They quoted him in the Post.  Did they?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  The line about the...  Trump always puts his name on the building so the bank knows which one's to take back.  That line destroyed.  Oh, there you go.  He had some really funny lines.  There you go.  He so doesn't deserve that girlfriend he's got.  Oh, she's hot, right?  Yeah.  Yeah, Bonnie's really hot.  And she's like a nice girl, too.  Yeah.  And I was staring at her tits the whole time.  I know she caught me at least five or six times.  I feel like a dirtbag.  Well, she was wearing a top where that was kind of hard.  Because Voss is chicken stuff, but it was really hard not to look at her tits. 
[00:36:00]  Like, if she talked to you and you make eye contact, in your peripheral, you would see cleavage.  And, you know, as I was talking to her, I wouldn't look down.  But then when she looked away, you kind of got to take a peek.  You got to take a peek.  Dude, I am...  And she doesn't...  How does she deserve Voss?  What wrong did she do in life that a nice girl like that deserves a rich Voss who's showing pictures of his cock to people on the street?  Yeah, he really does walk around with that Levitra rod picture.  And he's got a picture.  And the picture, isn't he... 
[00:36:30]  What is that?  What kind of camera is that out of?  It's like one of those mini Polaroids.  It's like what people use to take pictures of dead bodies on the ground, like the investigators use it.  That's the only camera he's getting into his little midget hands.  All right.  Well, why don't we step aside really fast?  We've got really a lot to do.  Someone wrote a song about Jim Norton.  Did they?  Yeah, and it could start a stupid little side contest.  He basically wrote a song after reading your blog.  With just lines from the blog.  And he used your own words in song. 
[00:37:00]  Didn't make any words up.  Whatever you wrote, he put to song.  And it's not bad.  It's not bad.  We'll play it in a few minutes.  I hope he uses semicolons.  I'm a big fan of the semicolon.  We went to Digital Life, whatever it's called, at the Javits Center this weekend.  I want to say hi to everyone.  We met there.  A lot of cool people came up and got their pictures taken.  And we taught them about XM Satellite Radio.  Yes, yes.  Which was unbelievable.  We signed autographs for, like, we could have been there all day, at least two to three hours.  And everyone's like, it's so good that you guys are back on the radio, man. 
[00:37:30]  It's been so long.  So I hope he would take his impromptu survey and ask him.  Oh, my God.  I'm like, so, you got the XM Satellite Radio yet?  No, but it's so good that you guys are back.  What?  Well, then we're not back in your eyes yet.  How do you know?  And a lot of these people are like, so when do you start?  We've been doing radio on XM Satellite Radio two weeks already.  You guys sound great.  Oh, you got XM?  No, but I'm downloading it.  I've downloaded some of your stuff.  Yeah, they're downloading our show all over the place, man. 
[00:38:00]  All over.  Great.  We might have to shut down some people.  I hate to do that, but, no, we won't do that ever, actually.  We won't have, we'll let them do what they have to do.  But our shows are being sold on eBay like crazy, too.  Oh, of course.  All right, but someone requested from our Dementor World CD a track called Green Bay Funeral Home,  and I told them I would play it today.  Oh, right.  I forgot all about this one.  So listen to this, and we'll come back, and we'll play the Norton song and get into a lot of things today.  Hello?  Yes, how do you? 
[00:38:30]  Okay, my name's Artie Milo, and my father had recently passed away.  Did your dad pass away, did you say?  Yes, yes, he did.  When was that?  I don't know, two, three days ago.  Okay.  Now, he wanted to watch the Super Bowl with his family, and we just want to know if there's a way you can come over  and, like, you know, temporarily, you know, prop him up in the big chair so when the family comes over he'll be okay  until after the Super Bowl, and then we'll bury him.  No, we can't do that, Mr. Milo. 
[00:39:00]  Oh, it was his one dream to watch the Packers in the Super Bowl, and we already painted his face green and gold.  No, but it would be, you mean, not get him until then?  Yeah, well, you could come over and maybe, you know, pump him with whatever you do and, you know, preserve him until after the bowl.  Oh, I'm afraid we just can't do it.  Why?  It was his dream, you know, to watch the Packers in the bowl, and we've been holding on to him for a couple of days now.  He's been in the barn, but, you know, the coyotes have been a-nipping, and I don't think he's going to make it until Sunday. 
[00:39:30]  No, he died.  Who knows that he has died?  Hopefully no one, but we just want you to come over and, you know, prop him up in the chair and maybe open up his hand so we can put a beer in there.  And we can't do that.  We can't embalm anybody at home.  Embalm, that's the word.  And we, once they're embalmed, they can't be, you know, they can't be in a sitting position.  You know, it just kind of...  Well, he's been in a sitting position now, and he's getting kind of hard, but if you could maybe do something and then lay him down later? 
[00:40:00]  No, I'm afraid we can't.  We'd even be up to, you know, if you've got to break something, it's okay.  No, we don't do that.  It was his one lifetime dream.  You see the Pack in the bowl with his family, and we got the big screen TV and the chair for him, and he went up and died.  We will not do that.  But if your dad has died and if you really have not notified anybody, you do have to do that.  So you have to have the medical examiner's approval to take him away.  Okay, look, what if we put the coffin in the house and put the TV on the coffin? 
[00:40:30]  That way he'll be with the family.  Is there a law or something?  No, if he was embalmed and if he was, you know, able, you know, like if there was, if there's no problem as far as preserving him.  Right.  And could you put like a pack banner in his hand?  Because it was his dream to see the packs in the bowl.  We could probably do that.  You could put a pack, well, that's okay?  Mm-hmm.  I don't know if we could have a visitation, you know, in the house depending on how, you know, how well he preserved he was and if we could get a casket into the house.  But once he's, you know, once he's embalmed, he is laying down. 
[00:41:00]  Right.  Okay.  Do you think that's like degrading if we put the cheesehead hat on him?  Do you want me to call the medical examiner for you?  Oh, no, that might not be a good idea.  Then we'd have to try to explain where his feet went.  Bye.  Can you say fuck on this channel?  Oh, jeez.  Here's another bunch of genetic defectives who've been turned loose on answering machines.  These guys who cannot resist the urge to put music on their outgoing messages. 
[00:41:30]  You know, some guy spends $8 at Radio Shack and suddenly he's a fucking record producer.  And because he's busy in the basement jacking off his dog, I, I have to listen to substandard music.  And it's always rotten music, you know?  It's either new age, that pointless, meandering zombie noise played by pseudo-spiritual lunatics  who think wind chimes are a musical instrument.  Or else it's soft rock. 
[00:42:00]  Soft rock.  That lame-ass, weak, non-threatening, suburban white boy junk played by bands like Men Without Testicles.  Oh, and folks, on these answering machines, do me a favor, would you please?  When you record your outgoing message, don't bother telling me you can't come to the phone.  I understand that.  Apparently, that's why we have these machines.  And don't tell me to leave my name and number.  Somehow, I figured that out.  And if you work in an office, never mind that stuff, I'm away from my desk. 
[00:42:30]  If you had to take a shit, say so.  Just say, hi, this is Mary Louise.  I had the Mexican jalapeno bean chili dip.  And I washed it down with a gallon of gin.  I'll be in and out all day.  There are some more people who ought to be strapped into chairs and beaten with hammers. 
[00:43:00]  People who wear visors.  Let me ask you something.  What the fuck is the point in wearing half a hat?  Either get a hat or don't.  No one's interested in the top of your head.  Go back to the store and tell them to give you the rest of the hat.  They cheated you.  Better still, get yourself one of them little Jewish hats and sew it to your visor. 
[00:43:30]  Then you got yourself a full-fledged fucking hat, my friend.  Here are some more musical vermin whose mothers we wish had had medical plans that included abortion.  These singers.  These singers who think they're so special, they only need one name.  Buono, Sting, Jewel, Tiffany, Prince.  What a crock of shit.  Get a fucking last name, would you please? 
[00:44:00]  I got a nice two-word name for you.  Pretentious Cocksucker.  How do you like that?  Buono, Sting.  It's not bad enough the music sucks, but with no last name, you can't find out where they live to throw a fucking bomb through their window.  It's frustrating.  Here are some more people who deserve an inoperable tumor at the base of their spines.  These guys who fly around the world in a fucking balloon. 
[00:44:30]  What is this, 1850?  Get a fucking airline ticket, will you please?  When are the media going to realize no one's interested in some rich trouser stain who's so bored he's got to fly around the balloon all day?  I hope the next guy gets hit by lightning.  He flies around in little fart circles. 
[00:45:00]  And lands in a sewage treatment pond.  And sinks with the rest of the turds.  Mr. Lighter Than Air.  Because your mom still buys your underpants. 
[00:45:30]  Turn down your TV.  Opie and Anthony.  Good morning, little pooper.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  And we're back with the Opie and Anthony Show.  A big hi to everyone that turned on their XM satellite radios over the weekend.  You have joined the program.  It's the O&A virus spreading across America. 
[00:46:00]  A big thank you also to everyone that is turning their friends on to the new program.  Right.  We appreciate it.  We need someone to turn people on to the new program.  Because we know the people down in Washington haven't really started their marketing campaign yet.  Ah, why start?  Got plenty of time, right?  Sure.  Well, our fans are taking the ball and running with it, man.  Some of the fans were emailing me saying that they got flyers that they're making themselves  and posting all over New York City and a few other cities that we were really big in. 
[00:46:30]  And they're doing all sorts of things for us.  And we greatly appreciate it.  I guess that's how we're going to get the jobs done.  The job done.  We're going to have to rely on our fans once again to help us out, Anthony.  All right?  Yeah.  Lots and lots of things to do.  I just was handed the list of items on eBay that is being sold under our names, Opie and Anthony.  Stuff like the Opie and Anthony XM Radio promo shirt.  Rare.  What?  Going for $29.  Opie and Anthony XM Satellite Radio weeks one and two. 
[00:47:00]  The bid is up to $12.50, Anthony.  Woo-hoo!  Yeah, you pretty much could get the service for that amount of money.  But I don't get that one.  But people are bidding on it like crazy.  The Opie and Anthony XM Radio keychain is still one of the hotter items up for sale on eBay.  This one's going for $10.50.  It's a plastic piece of shit keychain.  Awful.  Hey, hey.  It's a nice keychain.  The Opie and Anthony XM Satellite Radio wow stickers. 
[00:47:30]  This is a rare item because people still haven't gotten theirs.  Even though I guess you could go to opianthony.com and leave your address and they'll mail it out.  But I don't know.  Most people are emailing me and saying they just haven't gotten their stickers yet.  So I don't know what's going on with that down there in Washington.  Then all of our old radio shows, because we can't play them anymore, are selling like crazy on eBay.  Opie and Anthony's 9 CD volumes 22 to 30 going for $14, Anthony.  It goes on and on here.  Autographed t-shirts going for $15.50. 
[00:48:00]  More radio keychains.  DVDs.  Opie and Anthony DVDs.  Is Steve selling shit on the side?  He's the only one that has video of the Opie and Anthony show.  Where are people getting DVDs from?  No, no.  They're burning DVDs of the old shows because it can fit more on a DVD burn.  Oh, okay.  I thought it was actual video.  Well, I guess they could get all the video clips that were up on foundyourmusic.com and  put them together in a nice compilation.  Right, Steve?  Not without Steve.  Am I selling DVDs? 
[00:48:30]  Is that what you're asking?  It was a joke.  No, no, no.  Someone out there is selling like Opie and Anthony video.  Yeah, I hope I don't find them.  Oh.  Yeah, the motherfucker's getting it off my website.  Oh, boy.  Here we go.  Nice.  Go get them.  They're selling Opie and Anthony press passes.  I mean, the list just goes on and on and on and on.  I'm trying to find some of the better ones.  Yeah, okay.  The wiffle ball bat.  Oh, my God.  There used to only be like 15, 20 items.  We're up to like 50 items on eBay. 
[00:49:00]  Yeah, plenty of items now.  Oh, here it is.  The Opie and Anthony wiffle ball bat challenge replica.  Replica.  The Opie and Anthony wiffle ball bat challenge replica.  You only have six days left to bid on this fine item, Anthony.  The bid is up to $10.  Basically, the guy is selling wiffle ball bats.  Listen to the description.  Yeah, I guess.  You are bidding on a beautiful replica of the authentic O&A wiffle ball bat used to skewer  lovely and not-so-lovely ladies on their world-famous show. 
[00:49:30]  Show your love and loyalty to O&A by purchasing this replica and coaxing your lovely gal or significant  other into easing this device into their favorite orifice or just bring it to the next road  show.  So, love you, Opie.  Love you, Ann.  Jimmy, want to play Monster Rain?  It says that on eBay.  I know it says.  Well, he hasn't got a bid on the wiffle ball bat challenge replica.  He's looking for a starting bid, $9.99. 
[00:50:00]  Dude, I had another pair of underwear with a disaster in it.  I'm telling you, I'm bringing in the next pair and we're going to put it up on eBay.  We all got to bring stuff in for eBay.  Like real stuff from our homes.  I have artwork from childhood.  You do?  Would you give it up, though?  Yeah, why not?  All right.  We should put some real items on eBay and see if there's any takers, like just creepy items.  And then there's the Opie and Anthony Jim Norton positive herpes test is going up for bid on eBay.  What's the description of this one, Anthony? 
[00:50:30]  It says, that's right, people.  I have Jim Norton's positive test results for herpes.  You might have noticed he's sounding a little off these days on the ONA show.  Off?  I think you're tearing it up.  Maybe he meant sick.  Sick, I think, yeah.  Well, that's thanks to this lovely she-mail Jim frequently visits.  This original, notarized piece of history was found right next to the dumpster where Jim left his last lifeless victim.  Let Jim's unfortunate luck be your pot of gold. 
[00:51:00]  Here are some suggestions for Jim's positive test results.  Let Skippy treat Jim's lab report like most toothless transvestites treat Jim's meaty body.  Nothing like a golden shower on this clever house-breaking wee-wee pad.  Dog in picture not included, as Mr. Norton has been known to engage in casual bestiality.  There's a picture of a dog on there.  That's hilarious.  Put it on the fridge next to Little Billy's report card.  Frame it and hang it next to your private detective degree earned from the Correspondent School of America. 
[00:51:30]  Exchange it for a free hour at the New York Escort Loft, where you will meet the future ex-Mrs. Jim Norton,  and mail it to Rich Voss with the taunting message,  Ha-ha, Voss, at least Jim's positive result was only herpes.  Be dialing.  Be dialing, people.  Do you know, when I saw that ad, I laughed.  But for the first second I saw it, I panicked.  Like, I was like,  Did this guy get this from a dog?  I don't have herpes.  Oh, my God.  But, like, did I get a test that I had a... 
[00:52:00]  And then they said, the dumpster one made me laugh.  I'm like, all right, it's a goof.  I swear to God, I had a moment of panic.  You don't want to see positive herpes test after your name.  Oh, my God.  In any way, shape, or form.  The whole surfing of eBay, I do it every night now with our names,  because it's getting funnier and funnier, the stuff that they're, you know, trying to sell.  Well, and then there's the fake sales, obviously, but it's just a lot of fun reading.  Let's say hi to Jim in Brooklyn.  Hey, Jim.  Good afternoon, gentlemen.  I wish.  Well, it's afternoon.  It's afternoon somewhere. 
[00:52:30]  Hey, listen,  there was some wowing going on in Section 340 of the Meadowlands yesterday.  Nice.  One of them happened to be a teenager.  I can't say how old, because she was a little underage, but she was a teenager.  Underage wowing at the jet game yesterday afternoon?  Yes.  As a matter of fact, it was.  Was she hot?  Okay, she was, all right, she was 16.  All right.  Jesus.  Very good.  The wow is still alive out there.  It was definitely an interesting experience.  I have never seen security get booed as hot as they got booed, 
[00:53:00]  but they ended up removing the two young ladies, which really sucked.  Hill joys.  Security almost had all of Section 340 all over.  An illegal wow.  I like that.  It was quite interesting.  Well, thanks, Jim.  All right, guys.  Have a good one.  All right.  There he goes, Jim from Brooklyn.  Just the kids getting involved in the tailgating.  It's nice to see.  Jets-pats this coming weekend.  Both undefeated.  It's going to be a great, great weekend of football.  Let's say hi to James.  What is this football you speak of? 
[00:53:30]  Yeah.  Jets and what?  The Jets are undefeated.  Come on now.  James, what's up?  Hey, how are you guys?  Love the show.  Thanks.  We've got Maryland checking in.  Hey.  Hey.  What are you guys going to bring back the queef?  Yeah, I wrote that down in my little notepad for today.  We've really got to start talking about bringing the queef back.  The queef?  We've got to get it back.  Yeah.  So it used to be what?  The 5 o'clock queef?  5 o'clock queef.  5 o'clock queef.  No, no, no.  The 6 o'clock queef.  So we've got to get a...  6?  It was a 6 o'clock queef, yeah.  Who cares what time it is?  I know.  You're right. 
[00:54:00]  Just get the queef back.  Yeah, we've got to get the queef back.  We need some ladies to call up and do some queefing for us on the air.  That was another bit that was taken away from us.  I never realized how many girls are able to do this at will, you know?  They could just suck in some air and blow it back out right into the phone and...  Well, that's a bit we're going to want to bring back sooner than later.  Maybe today.  That's a sound you don't want to hear in bed, though.  Why?  That's hot.  Oh, God. 
[00:54:30]  Stop it.  It's not hot.  That's hot.  Never, ever hot, the queef.  No.  You don't want that sound.  They always get embarrassed.  It's hilarious.  All of a sudden...  I'm sorry.  I'm sorry.  I'm sorry.  I don't know what's going on.  I'm sorry.  Like a pump just working.  Or when they just go...  Right.  Like you pull out...  Yeah.  They're holding that air inside their rancid little bodies, and as soon as your mule is 
[00:55:00]  out, the air escapes.  I'm sorry.  Disgusting filthy holes.  I'm sorry.  It's never hot.  Why?  The queef.  It's better than hearing, like, dryness.  What do you hear, John?  What does dryness sound like?  There's no sound.  No.  That is disgusting.  I'm not a big fan of the queef sound.  It sounds like a fart.  Excuse me.  So thumbs up or down?  Do we bring back the queef?  I like it on the phone.  It's funny.  All right.  It's, like, funny.  And just the thought that, you know, you're broadcasting an air rushing out of a vagina is pretty cool. 
[00:55:30]  All right.  But to hear it in bed when you're, you know, going at it is just something you don't want.  Well, let's see if we get a lady to do the queef today.  Sorry.  And whatever time she does it out, that'll be the official time for the queef every morning.  Okay?  Never want to hear an apology for anything in bed.  But they always do that.  They're always like, sorry.  They look back.  Oops.  Oops.  Sorry.  Air-filled meat pocket.  All right.  We got a meat pocket.  We got a Jim Norton song that came in. 
[00:56:00]  Yes.  From David Greek.  This guy is not bad.  He's pretty talented.  Oh, I like the idea that people are starting to send in some material.  That's good.  I like the people a part of the show.  I like the songs that get sent in, especially some of the really bad ones.  Well, Digital Life, a bunch of people came up to us and said, are you guys going to be  able to bring back the Most Offensive Song Contest now that you're on satellite radio?  Oh, yes, we will.  We got in such trouble for the Most Offensive Song Contest.  It was legendary.  Absolutely legendary.  Maybe what we could do this week is to bring in some of the examples of the Most Offensive 
[00:56:30]  Song Contest, because there are other people's songs.  We can play them still.  Titles like, I'm Horny for Little Girls.  Yeah.  That was a great one.  That was a good one.  Perhaps you remember the hit Baby Raper.  Oh, yeah.  That one got us in a little bit of trouble.  How about the KKK song?  The KKK song.  Oh, is that good?  Done to Candyman.  I kind of like the Full Blown AIDS song myself.  Full Blown AIDS.  What song ended up winning that? 
[00:57:00]  That's a good trivia contest.  Remember Camp Concentration?  Oh, Camp Concentration.  I think Baby Raper won, because it was truly the most offensive song ever.  Yeah, we had them all perform live at that event, Long Island.  I know.  That was an amazing event.  I could be wrong, but I think it was Baby Raper.  I think you're right.  It had been I'm Horny for Little Girls.  The Sex Bag will have all the songs for the Most Offensive Song Contest?  For little girls.  Like you.  Those little girls have hairless little twats.  That was the first line.  Why don't we bring in some of those songs, and we'll pepper them in this week, Anthony.  We'll just pepper them.  Let's do that. 
[00:57:30]  Just to give an example of what the Most Offensive Song Contest was all about.  Yeah.  We've got to kick that back up.  We're going to need a little more time to get this show up to speed, and then we'll bring  back the Most Offensive Song Contest No. 2.  Nice.  You have those songs?  Some of them?  I can have them first thing tomorrow morning.  All right.  Tomorrow morning.  Well, that's good.  That's good enough.  So speaking of songs, this guy David Greek, he might have started a nice little thing that  other people could follow here.  Here's an original song with the words written completely by little Jimmy Norton, he writes.  I was fascinated by Jim being able to make a man vomit just from the stench of his belly 
[00:58:00]  button residue, so I went to Jim's online blog at eatabullet.com and used his own words  to write a song.  Here were the rules.  He even has rules for his own game if anyone else wants to participate, Anthony.  Number one, all the lyrics are pulled directly from Norton's website, well, the blog on  your website.  You can link to the blog from the website, yeah.  You could get the blog at eatabullet.com.  Number two, I did not add any words of my own, but I did remove words from sentences if  I had to fit the rhyme scheme, okay?  And number three, I kept it effing short because everybody knows song parodies or ditties or 
[00:58:30]  whatever are awful radio poison, which is kind of true, unless you do a Most Offensive Song  Contest.  Yes.  I hope you guys enjoy this.  I'm an FM rock radio DJ in Richmond, Virginia.  For Christ's sakes, how many times can I say that was Nickelback?  You guys rock.  Thanks for being a part of Real Uncensored Radio.  And Jim, I know you've got to get up early, but get off your ass and update your blog once  in a while.  It's Dave.  Tell Dave I'm right.  I was actually writing on it yesterday.  It'd be updated. 
[00:59:00]  Bye, today.  I love the blog, man.  It's very funny.  So here's Dave's song, and it's Jimmy's words from the blog on eatabullet.com.  Let's check it out.  I woke up around four.  Stopped at Bob Kelly's to play some cards.  Bob is converting the cash into chips.  I'm kicking my belly and sniffing it.  I always try to get people to sniff, but there are very rarely any takers. 
[00:59:30]  Voss has a similar odor emanating from behind his ear.  So today I am digging and sniffing.  I asked dumb Bob if he'd like a whiff.  He says, no way am I smelling.  I figure that's the end of it.  By now we started our poker playing.  I asked if he'd do it.  Four to one dollar chips.  This compulsive, greedy motherfucker says. 
[01:00:00]  Woo!  Two bucks!  Okay.  Sitting there with his eyes closed.  I hold my finger straight under his nose.  He retches and bolts to the bathroom.  He kept saying, oh my God, dude.  I snapped a picture of him.  It was better than heroin.  I cannot express the joy of seeing this ball creep on his hands and feet. 
[01:00:30]  It's not bad, right?  It's not bad.  I get a little choked up when I heard it.  It's not bad at all.  I like the fact that he wrote it using only Jim's words from the blog.  Well, yeah.  Well, that's the rules of the game.  That's the whole gimmick.  If someone else wants to try it, maybe we'll get another version like a punk song or something.  You never know.  Maybe a reggae beat Anthony.  Give it a try.  Now my blog writing is going to be unnatural because I'm going to be looking at rhyme schemes.  Trying to rhyme it.  Don't worry about rhyme schemes.  They'll figure out the rhyme schemes.  All right. 
[01:01:00]  Funny thing today.  I did the show.  Well, you know how it goes.  Semi-colon.  You know.  You might be on to something.  We'll see.  Rhyme something with tots.  That's the beauty of the show.  The listeners get involved and do the show for us, I guess, right?  Yeah.  Okay.  Tots.  Tots.  Time for another George Carlin bit, I guess.  Ah.  No.  And we'll continue.  No.  Welcome to the Opie and... 
[01:01:30]  This one, it was about this woman that just got married.  It was called Debbie Does Every Fucking Thing That Gets In Her Way.  So I go into the movie, right?  And what happens, it starts out, she's having a fight with her husband.  Understand what I'm saying to you?  So she takes off in the car.  What does she do?  She goes into this Jewish deli.  Kosher meat.  Kosher meat.  And there's this guy Mendel working behind the counter, right?  So he's giving a, like, free taste test with the corned beef, right? 
[01:02:00]  Next thing you know, they're in the back, right?  He's on top of her.  You ever hear a Jewish guy make love?  It's unbelievable.  He's on top of her.  He's like,  So now what happens, this little Chinese guy hears what's going on. 
[01:02:30]  He comes running in, and he sees Debbie doing this gay, right?  So now the chink gets behind the rain, right?  And he gets behind, and he starts fucking.  He's like,  So Debbie's crazy, right?  She grabs a holly, right? 
[01:03:00]  Runs out of the restaurant, and she trips over this Indian.  Who's living outside the restaurant in this teepee.  I don't know how he got there, right?  So he grabs her.  He throws her in the teepee, right?  Next thing you know, he's on top of her, and she's excited.  She never fucked Tonto, right?  He gets on top, and he's like,  You piece of trash.  You fucking piece of shit.  Because you should get cancer, baby. 
[01:03:30]  So now what happens, she starts feeling a little bad, you know?  She feels bad.  She left her husband.  So she decides, yeah, it happens.  You know how these always are.  All she wanted was an excuse to get the fizz, you know what I'm saying?  So she's driving home, and she pulls into a gas station for a little gas, right?  So it's a tying gas station.  Tendon comes out.  He's real cool, you know?  And he goes, you know, I think you need a tune-up. 
[01:04:00]  So he gets her in the garage.  Next thing you know, we stand him behind.  Uh-huh.  Uh-huh.  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  You should get cancer, ideal PC!  You know, we play a game.  It's everything XM 202. 
[01:04:30]  XM News, Toss Sports, and information 24-7.  For seven cents a day, you can get Opie and Anthony.  Or feed this little kid with the flies on his face.  Ah!  But you want to laugh, don't you? 
[01:05:00]  You don't want to be depressed watching starving children.  So turn him up and turn on Opie and Anthony.  And we'll send you a photo of the child you're helping in the outfit of your choice.  Yeah, we're back with the Opie and Anthony show. 
[01:05:30]  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Oswald from Jersey reminds us that the most offensive...  Oh, most of the offensive songs are on oavirus.com if people want to hear them before tomorrow morning, okay?  Oavirus.com is a great website if you're looking for all our old stuff, Anthony.  Right.  Okay.  Most offensive songs.  We're a bit sluggish today, thanks to the game that lasted until 1.30 in the morning. 
[01:06:00]  Went on forever.  Ever and ever.  But it's time to play Sucks to Be You, Anthony.  Ah, I love Sucks to Be You.  We kind of challenged the rest of the country to come up with a better Sucks to Be You news story.  It has to be a real news story.  It can't be some stupid story in the weekly world news or something.  There are two things.  There's Sucks to Be You.  An unlucky lottery.  An unlucky lottery.  Unlucky lottery sounds like the same thing, but they are different.  What's an example of unlucky lottery? 
[01:06:30]  Unlucky lottery.  An example would be driving down the street where there are no huge boulders except maybe one.  And that boulder decides after sitting up there for a million years or two million or a billion years to roll down the hill, crush you and your family in the car.  That is definitely unlucky lottery because odds of it is going to happen.  Astronomical.  What about when you're on the highway and you're following the plumbing truck?  Uh-huh.  The plumbing truck is in front of you. 
[01:07:00]  All of a sudden, one of those pipes come out, bounces a couple times, goes through the windshield and impales you in front of your family.  That's kind of more of a Sucks to Be You because it's happened a lot.  You know?  It could be unlucky lottery because the odds that it's going to happen.  That one's tricky.  A Sucks to Be You, though, is just something stupid happening.  Maybe we should just have one category then.  There is definitely a difference between the two.  And unlucky lottery and good lottery have a very close relationship, obviously. 
[01:07:30]  Like, for instance, if you're driving and the boulder falls on the car and only crushes your awful wife and family, that's lucky lottery.  Lucky lottery.  Like, look at this.  Now I can go out and bang 18-year-olds, get a few little coffins together, save some cash that I would have wasted at Christmas, take out that big-titted girl at the mall.  Jesus.  All right.  Well, we've got a Sucks to Be You story.  This is Sucks to Be You.  Oh, you know why it's Sucks to Be You?  Because this guy could have prevented this from happening to himself. 
[01:08:00]  Could have prevented it.  You can't prevent the boulder that decides it wants to test gravity after a million years.  Out of nowhere.  So maybe that's what it is.  Maybe Sucks to Be You is something that you could have controlled.  Could have prevented it.  But you were so stupid that something like this happens to you.  Sucks to Be You, usually some form of stupidity.  All right.  Yeah.  Hearing aid horror on train tracks.  What was that?  Hearing aid horror on train tracks.  You got me so bad.  I know I did.  And then I went with it, making believe.  What?  What?  What?  What? 
[01:08:30]  With the big ear.  Oh, brother.  I'm checking off.  I need another cover.  It would have been funny if it was like 20 years ago.  All right.  Always funny.  The hearing aid that a desperately poor Bangladeshi immigrant received two months ago changed his  life.  Couldn't hear.  Got the hearing aid.  It changed his life.  From Bangladesh?  Bangladesh.  Now you can hear his stomach rumble.  It also caused his death.  Wah, wah, wah, wah, wah. 
[01:09:00]  Ah.  Ah.  Name I can't pronounce.  Pronounce, excuse me.  I just call him Bob.  Name I can't pronounce was waiting for a northbound number six train at the Canal Street  Station in Lower Manhattan Saturday night when he somehow dropped the hearing aid on the  tracks.  Oopsie.  I've seen this so many times and if this happens to you, it just, you're a dope first of all  and leave it alone.  Chalk it up as a loss.  I call this thinning the herd, Anthony.  We need things like this to happen to stupid people.  Gee, I wonder what happens. 
[01:09:30]  Gee, I'm on the edge of my seat.  I wonder how this ends.  What happened to this wacky Bangladeshiian?  Well, we'll tell you right after this.  Yeah, he drops the hearing aid on the tracks.  Desperate over the loss of the device, name I can't pronounce, who is 67 years old, climbed  down onto the tracks to try to find it.  Yeah.  But he couldn't hear a train approaching.  Oh, you don't want to not hear that.  Because he didn't have the hearing aid in.  Jesus.  Nor the frenzied warnings of other strap hangers. 
[01:10:00]  With tragedy, a heartbeat away, Eric, an NYU sophomore, rushed to the edge of the platform  and grabbed, name I can't pronounce, his armpits.  He managed to lift the elderly man halfway up before the train plowed into him.  I was holding him by the armpits when the train hit him.  Hey, how did a car get in there?  I could hold onto him and he went probably 20 yards.  Name I can't pronounce.  Wait, he grabbed him?  Name I can't pronounce.  Was pronounced dead at Bellevue Hospital. 
[01:10:30]  The guy tried to grab him?  The guy grabbed him by his armpits and was lifting him up.  Oh!  And then he lost him because then the train came by and took him.  So he's got him by the armpits.  The train comes and just gets him and squishes him between the train and the platform.  He probably spun like a top in between the train and the platform.  And the worst part of the whole thing is now that student has to go home and wash whatever  stink is on his hands.  You don't understand the armpit odor of a dying Bangladeshi half-deaf immigrant?  How bad those pits smell? 
[01:11:00]  Especially since he's sweating looking for his hearing aid on the dirty train tracks.  Ugh!  I bet you he didn't realize it until he put his hands in his face.  Can you talk?  You fat-titted, mediocre failure.  I was with you nodding and everything.  Like, come on, come on.  Went to put his face in his hands to sob and freeze.  Oh, and then just went...  Yeah.  That would have been a lot funnier.  Maybe Regis could have said that one a little funnier.  Or Bangladeshi stinkmeister.  That's what he was. 
[01:11:30]  Hey, Rob, what's up, buddy?  Hey, how you doing?  Pretty good.  Okay, I got an unlucky lotto story for you.  Okay.  Okay.  This happened a couple years ago.  I used to program DirecTV cards for, like, the satellite cards.  Right.  And I got a knock on my door one morning, and this guy's serving me papers.  And I look on the paper, and it says DirecTV versus, and there must have been five names.  And I was on the list.  Now, out of all the people in New York, the millions of people stealing satellite TV, I 
[01:12:00]  was on this freaking list, getting served with papers from DirecTV.  And the way they called me was because my name was on the customer list that I bought my  DirecTV programming unit from.  The feds busted them, and I got busted.  Were you stealing?  Uh, yeah, I was programming cards for me.  I was programming cards for, uh...  That's not really unlucky lottery, then.  It was preventable.  Yeah, but...  You're a thief who got caught stealing, and they charged you with it. 
[01:12:30]  Well, what happened to you, sir?  What was the penalty?  Oh, um, we settled out of court, and I had to pay, like, $5,000, like, monthly payment,  so it wasn't too bad.  Five grand you got to pay?  Yeah.  I remember the old days, cable television, climbing up the pole, stringing my own wire.  I brought it from Radio Shack across the street, over to my house, and then, like, two months  later, it would be cut, like the cable guy would come and see it, and cut the wire, and  you'd go back up.  I was there with the, like, tools, opening up the box on the pole, I'm taking off filters. 
[01:13:00]  How'd you figure out how to do all that?  I was the guy.  I was the go-to cable guy for my friends.  I just kind of figured it out.  You get out there when you don't have cable, and you don't have money to buy cable, but  you want to watch cable.  You kind of figure it out.  I got the ladder, put it against the pole, get up there, open it up, and take a look  around.  You jiggle a few wires, you pull out a few filters, put them back.  Yeah.  I want to get rid of HBO.  Maybe you can help me hook up WHT.  I want to get Wameco Home Theater.  Do you remember that? 
[01:13:30]  Wameco Home Theater?  Do you remember that?  I want Cinema 100.  Was that before or after?  Oh, my God.  That was, like, 1978, where you had a box on top of your television, and it had one switch  and a key, and you had to turn the key and flip the switch, and you would get one extra  channel.  It was Cinema 100.  And they would show movies like Cheerleaders and Fairy Tales, these softcore pornography.  And then during the day, they would show major motion pictures that came out, like, ten 
[01:14:00]  years prior.  That was before WHT.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  I remember my first Rated-R movie ever was The Hills Have Eyes, and I saw it with my  friend Bill D'Angelo at his place.  They would only show Rated-R movies after 8 p.m.  Yeah, after 8.  We saw, what was the one with the two fingers up Marlon's ass in the butter?  Last Tango in Paris.  Oh, Last Tango in Paris, yeah.  A friend of mine had HBO.  None of us did, and invited us over.  His parents were going away.  It was like everything happened perfectly.  His parents were going away, had the HBO.  It was a weekend. 
[01:14:30]  We went and watched Marlon Brando get two fingers put up his ass with some butter, and a stick  of butter up his ass.  Well, you guys really were a rowdy party.  That's such a hot experience.  We were crazy.  Hey, guys, the folks are out of town.  It's the Last Tango in Paris party.  Yeah.  That's horrendous.  Well, there were chicks in it, too.  It wasn't like we were waiting to see Marlon Brando get a finger up the ass.  I'd have more respect for you if you were outside and you realized that it was getting  cloudy.  Let's run under the porch.  A little monster rain coming down, people. 
[01:15:00]  I forgot my umbrella.  That would be great if the weatherman started forecasting that.  Little children giving each other blowjobs on the map.  A little monster rain coming into our area.  Frontal system.  You know, the sunshine over Colorado, a little thunderstorm over Florida, and then over  New York, Jimmy's head with a cock in his mouth.  They always show the sun smiling, the little face.  Is that what you just said? 
[01:15:30]  They'll have your face just tearing up.  Let me just finish stealing Anthony's joke and then redoing it back to him.  Redoing it as your own.  What a dull thief I am.  Make sure you bring your chapstick out today, people.  There's going to be some monster rain in your area.  Coming up the East Coast.  We got another one, Anthony.  Unlucky lottery.  They're already challenging us out there.  Or is this a sucks to be you?  21-year-old dies after falling into a vat of hot tar in Connecticut.  A 21-year-old contractor working on the roof of the Warner Theater in Torrington fell into 
[01:16:00]  a vat of hot tar and died.  The tar was reportedly 500 degrees.  Two of the man's co-workers were injured while attempting to pull him from the vat.  One co-worker is being treated for burns.  The Warner Theater issued the following statement.  We here at the Warner Theater are deeply saddened by the terrible tragedy that took place today  when an Eastern roofing employee fatally fell while working on the roof of the quality building. 
[01:16:30]  On behalf of the Warner board, staff, and volunteers, our thoughts and prayers go out to his family  at this difficult time.  Friday's performance is canceled.  Why cancel?  Why wreck everyone else's time?  This is sucks to be you, not unlucky lottery.  It sucks to be you because it sounds like he fell doing something on the job and fell into the vat of hot tar.  If he was walking and, let's say, on one of the light poles, a transformer fell, hung onto the wire, 
[01:17:00]  swung across the roof, knocked him into the vat, that's definitely unlucky lottery  because the odds of something like that happening would be very slim.  So sucks to be you is stuff that maybe if you were paying a little more attention,  you could have prevented from happening.  Yeah.  And then unlucky lottery is just...  Unlucky lottery is the type...  It happens in New York a few times a year, those manhole covers blow up into the air...  Right.  ...and crush somebody.  Yeah, yeah.  But they don't even know why it happens.  All of a sudden, they just go flying out of the ground, go up 100, 200 feet sometimes,  depending, and then usually lands on someone and kills them. 
[01:17:30]  Yeah.  That would be unlucky lottery.  There's no way you see that happening.  Yeah, unlucky lottery is like God running you through a game of mousetrap,  where all of a sudden you're just living life and, you know, here it comes.  Wah, wah, wah, wah.  You're done.  We have two today already.  Let's go to Nina in Tennessee.  Hey, Nina.  Hey, Norton.  Hmm?  I keep having dirty dreams about you.  Really?  You and everyone else.  Well, tell me.  Yeah, what do you dream about?  Oh, it starts out that I come out in a pink negligee with pink thong panties and high heels. 
[01:18:00]  Yeah, Jim's wearing the same.  Oh, I love it.  And I come out and I sit on your face.  Oh, oh.  And I start sucking your dick.  Then he turns into a Buick and you drive away.  Stupid dreams.  Don't you hate that?  Oh, I know.  Let me ask you the important question.  How fat a gal are you?  I'm not.  Oh, really?  Well, give us some measurements. 
[01:18:30]  I'm 5'4".  I'm 119 pounds.  I'm 34 C.  But I have a big ass.  I like that.  Oh, wow.  I like big butts and I cannot lie.  Yeah.  Do you have a picture you could send us just so I could scrap to it?  I can mail you one.  Please do to yellowtreats at AOL.com.  Well, you got to send one to Steve so you can put it up, right?  Okay.  So do you masturbate thinking of Jim Norton?  All the time.  Really?  Why don't you do it today for us?  Are you lying?  Well, come on, baby. 
[01:19:00]  Where are you now?  Come on, baby.  Come on, baby.  Show us what you got.  Okay, now wait.  Come on, Nina.  Show us what you got there in Tennessee.  Let me go jump in the bunk real quick.  Jump in the what?  In the bunk.  How old are you?  Are you getting into bed?  How old are you?  I'm 32.  Oh, all right.  You just said bunk.  I'm like, you've got to listen to those questions.  All right.  You're going to jump in your bunk, and what's in your bunk?  You got anything that you could do a little manual manipulation? 
[01:19:30]  A couple of toys in there or something?  When you have those dirty Jimmy dreams?  I was getting used to my fingers, but I got a vibrator that's underneath the bunk.  Break that out.  All right.  Jimmy is now touching himself.  Give your snatch the old Bill O'Reilly.  Okay.  Now wait.  Hold on.  Let me get.  Are you a married girl, are you?  Yeah.  What do your husband think of these dreams?  Oh, he doesn't care, because then he gets the advantage of it. 
[01:20:00]  Is he surprised when he wakes up and you're squatting, dropping a log on his chest?  And how many kids have you pumped out there, baby?  I have no kids.  I had my tubes tied.  You had your tubes tied?  Good girl.  Look at you.  All right.  So what do you got going on there, Nina?  Now wait.  I'm trying to get it.  I haven't used it in a long time.  I use my fingers.  Well, what will work better, your fingers or that vibrator?  I want to hear the vibrator, though.  Probably my fingers.  All right.  I'll get the vibrator. 
[01:20:30]  That's all right.  All right.  Let's get the vibrator going.  Yeah.  Get that going, babe.  Babe, brr.  Babe, babe.  I'll wait.  And what would you like Jim Norton to do to you, babe?  I don't want him to fuck my ass.  Whoa.  Well, you're a meat and potatoes gal, aren't you?  Wow.  I like that.  You know that ass munching is making a comeback, right?  Yeah.  Yeah.  All right.  Is it all clean back there?  Okay, yeah.  I hear a vibrator, brr. 
[01:21:00]  I heard something.  How long will this take there, Nina?  It'll take me two minutes.  I know right where my spot is.  All right.  Don't rock your house off the cinder blocks, though.  Yeah, hit the vibrator on the phone so we can hear how powerful this thing is.  Okay.  It has a setting of blowing my brains out.  Hold on.  Wow.  All right.  All right.  That'll do some damage.  Let's listen in.  All right.  Let's listen in.  You just put the phone somewhere and don't pay any attention to us being here and just  go to town.  This is called doing the Bill O'Reilly, brr. 
[01:21:30]  Yeah.  I'm not shoving it up my ass now.  Allegedly, brr.  Okay.  Hold on.  I'm going to have my husband hold the phone while I drop my drawers.  Wait.  Your husband's right there?  Kind of ruined it a little bit.  I'll tell you that.  Yeah.  Didn't we have a...  Hey, what's going on?  Ah.  What's going on?  We were hoping to just have your lovely wife there.  Yeah, you just wrecked this whole thing, bro.  Kind of ruined it with a guy in the room.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I get it.  I don't know.  The fact that he's...  Because a lot of the women that will call in and say that they're alone have a guy there 
[01:22:00]  anyway.  At least this couple's being honest.  All right.  So...  Yeah, honesty is the best policy.  You know, it's funny.  I was taught the same thing as a little boy.  It's funny how these little things come into adulthood.  I'd rather have honesty than just a hot picture of a girl alone in the bed with a vibrator.  And not to correct parents, but giving a guy a hummer and then getting out and then getting  yourself killed in traffic is actually the best policy.  Honesty is fourth.  All right.  Hey, so what's going on with Nina there, bro?  Okay.  I'm back.  All right.  You're back.  So what's going on?  You're naked, Nina? 
[01:22:30]  Yeah.  All right.  She's masturbating in front of her husband because she loves Jim Norton so much.  Let's listen to it.  Oh, God.  Oh, Jim.  I'm just a man sucking your balls.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh, God. 
[01:23:00]  Oh.  Oh, God damn.  I love this satellite radio.  Yeah.  Let me tell you.  Oh, God.  Let me tell you.  Very nice.  That's what I'm talking about.  That was a big...  What?  Wow.  Oh, that was awesome.  That was really quick.  It's a lot better than it would be with the real me, believe me. 
[01:23:30]  And it lasted longer.  What was your husband doing?  You don't have to clean up.  What was your husband doing while you did that?  He was watching.  Yeah?  Did he get turned on or what?  Uh-huh.  Now you guys are going to go F a little while?  Uh, probably after we get him loaded.  Get him what?  Get him loaded.  Get him a run.  Oh, oh, oh.  I didn't hear it.  Get him drunk.  Oh, get him drunk, really?  Yeah, that's what I thought she said.  Loaded.  Why does he have to get drunk?  I'll tell you what.  I'll call in next week.  That's how they do it down there.  We'll have to go over the radio.  All right, yeah.  We're going to pencil you in for every Monday around 715. 
[01:24:00]  Okay, Nina?  Sounds like a plan.  All right, Nina.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Bye, Morton.  Bye, sweetheart.  I'm discovering that Tennessee is the wildest state in America so far.  Seems to be.  Absolutely.  That's where the sex is happening.  Because that other couple last week called from Tennessee, right?  Yeah.  To have sex live on our show?  Yep.  We've gotten a good response from Tennessee.  Great response from Tennessee.  Who knew?  They put a little pin in the Tennessee portion of our map across America there.  All right.  Let me put my big head mask on, and I'll stick a pin in that map. 
[01:24:30]  That's right.  All the bikers will talk to you like you're a normal person with real value, when the reality  is that they weren't trying to bang your hot, washed-up singer mom, they'd be using your  face to a dartboard.  Let's say hi to George in Buffalo.  Hey, George.  Hey, how's it going?  What's up?  Well, my story after that little thing with Nina is, like, why even bother fucking talking  about it?  I know.  You want to follow Voss.  Yeah, I can't follow that.  But, hey, that guy that fell in the vat of tar, one of the guys that picked him out of 
[01:25:00]  it was his father-in-law.  Oh, man.  That blurt.  Was he still alive when he got picked out of it, I wonder?  I don't know.  I was up there in Connecticut.  I was driving a truck.  I was in Connecticut the day it happened, and they said that he fell, like, 29 feet into  the vault, so he was probably dead by the time he got in there anyway.  But they were trying to pull him out.  How big is a vat of tar, dude?  How big is it?  I don't know anything about roofing.  It's those, you know, you see him on the back of a truck going down the highway, stinking  every once in a while with that little flapper thing on the top.  It's probably eight by eight. 
[01:25:30]  Oh.  So there's no way to prevent you from falling in?  Well, yeah, if you don't fall off the fucking roof first.  Well, yeah, obviously.  I'm sorry.  I didn't think of that.  Oh, no, no, it's just a big open vat.  Well, I'm just happy that it wasn't a baby that fell in.  Yeah.  Holy ass.  Thank you, George.  Oh, my God.  We'll let the audience do the math on that one.  Scott from Atlanta.  Hey, Scott.  Hey.  What's up?  I'll tell you what.  You want to talk about some bad luck.  Yeah.  Having a hard time.  Okay, you're getting ready to turn 30 years old. 
[01:26:00]  You have a hard time with that.  If it ain't hard enough, you know, you have problems, your wife leaves you, and on the  day of your 30th birthday, what do you get served?  Divorce papers?  Yeah, but you want to talk about a suck-ass day.  I'd pull out a fine gift.  What?  You mean the one who...  And it was wrapped in birthday present gifts.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  That's a great present.  I mean, the one who wears the house coat and talks during the game and wants to bang  once every three months and wants out of the relationship?  Good.  I didn't want out of the relationship. 
[01:26:30]  That's the problem.  Yes, you did.  Oh, poor guy.  I just got fucked big time.  All right.  Well, thank you, Scott.  Good luck to you, sir.  All right, man.  You guys rock.  Norton, you rock, man.  Thank you.  You're better off without that dead weight, believe me.  All right, believe me.  Her stupid cold cream on her face.  She stinks.  Good luck to you.  I got her back.  I got her back.  Oh, you got her back?  How?  Yeah.  How?  She's in the basement.  I had to move back to California to get her back.  You dress up like the gimp and rape her when company comes over?  Yeah, I'm sure this relationship is going to turn out really well. 
[01:27:00]  You had to move in order to keep her?  Yeah, he's gone.  Oh, he's gone.  We'll take one more here.  Let's say hi to Sarah in Boston.  Hey, Sarah.  What's up?  Sarah, let's go.  I know you guys are tired up there in Boston today after that big win.  Fell asleep right before he hit the ball.  I don't know why.  But anyway, I saw you guys, and I think I saw you in a magazine.  Hi, Sarah.  What magazine did you see us in?  Hi.  Martha Stewart Living.  We're not being advertised in Martha Stewart Living. 
[01:27:30]  Well, wait.  It was a Mr. Clean ad.  I don't know if you guys know anyone that does caricatures or draws, but I swear it was you and Ian.  Wow.  What drug are you on?  You know, everyone up in Boston is drunk right now, Opie.  I just got to let you know.  Everyone in Boston is drunk.  You know, I'm actually not, but I was reading it yesterday, and I had my fiance look at it.  I go, don't you think it's open-air?  And he goes, well, someone's rollerblading.  Doesn't Opie rollerblade? 
[01:28:00]  So, I don't know.  Oh, maybe the guy that drew the cartoon put your mugs in there as kind of like an inside goof or something that looks like you for the end.  No, I doubt it.  I will try to find this out.  I doubt we're in Martha Stewart Living.  Do you have a copy of it?  I can give you guys.  I mean, it's not what I can get.  Sarah, you need some sleep.  Yeah, go to sleep.  Everyone in Boston, just go to sleep.  Just go to sleep already.  Yeah, announcement to all our Boston fans.  Go to sleep and listen to the replay today.  Don't worry about it.  Three more to go.  Don't worry. 
[01:28:30]  You got it wrapped up.  We got the show.  We're taking care of the show today.  You guys go listen to the replay.  All right?  Welcome back.  All right, Sarah.  Thank you.  What were they calling those dog penises that they were knocking together in Boston at Fenway?  Oh, those are the Thundersticks.  No, no, no.  Oh, they have something else?  They have been robbed by the Boston fans, and they call them something else.  They're not Thundersticks.  They were calling them Red something.  It looked like dog dicks.  It seems like they're just pilfering from other teams in the league.  But I like when they turn the hats inside out. 
[01:29:00]  Hey, guys, let's get a rally started.  Rally caps.  We have our rally caps on.  That seems to have worked last night.  Ah, big deal.  I knew that big, awful David Ortiz would kill us.  Oh, that hurts.  Let's say hi to John.  Hey, John.  Hey, how you guys doing?  What's up?  Hey, man.  I got a stuff to be new.  I'm on a local first aid squad.  And one day we get a call to somebody's house.  And there was a tree-triving crew there.  And one of the guys stuck a branch into the chipper. 
[01:29:30]  The wood chipper, yeah.  Yeah, and he didn't go all the way in.  So he stuck his leg in to push him in.  And his leg got caught and it sucked him in.  It chopped him up to about his midsection.  And I think his brother went over and grabbed him underneath the armpit and pulled him out.  Oh, my God.  He was gone.  And he had all of his friends and stuff hanging out.  That is a sucks to be you.  Sucks to be you, yeah.  He felt like he had to take care of the situation. 
[01:30:00]  He didn't have to do that.  Why do some of our phone calls sound like real audio?  I know.  Remember the old real audio?  Real audio.  The old streaming days.  I noticed that on the replays over the weekend, a lot of the phone calls sound like real audio.  The quality of a lot of the phones are just awful.  Bob from Long Island.  What's up, Bob?  Hey, how you doing?  Okay.  I got an unlucky ladder for you guys.  When I was 12, I was playing Little League Baseball.  It's my turn to bat.  And right when I have to go up and hit the ball, I have to take the biggest shit like you would imagine. 
[01:30:30]  So they stop the game.  I go into the porta potty to go take a shit.  And when I come back, I have shit stains on the back of my pants.  Now, all the kids, everybody's laughing their ass off.  And I have no idea why they're laughing until I get to third base.  And my dad comes up and he's rubbing dirt on my ass to cover up the shit thing.  So now the whole game, all the kids are like, farting behind me.  Now, every game after that, I felt like I had to take a shit because of this one fucking game.  I don't think that really qualifies as sucks to be you or unlucky lottery. 
[01:31:00]  I think that qualifies...  No, I was just going to say that's shitty ass.  That doesn't have...  Oh, but come on.  You know how embarrassing that is in front of everybody?  That may not fall into the quality of sucks to be you, but it does fall into the quality of lucky dad.  Then interrupt dirt on a soiled little bottom while you stand there with your tear-stained Little League face.  All right.  All embarrassed, just looking for some comforting.  Dad runs over with a handful of dirt and underpants full of comfort. 
[01:31:30]  Let's take a break and we'll continue, all right?  Drunk girls walking into traffic.  He's funny.  Wandered into traffic.  Hello, I'm Rodney Carrington.  Dear Penis  I don't think I like you anymore  You used to watch me shave  Now all you do is stare at the floor 
[01:32:00]  Oh, dear penis  I don't like you anymore  It used to be you and me  A paper towel and a dirty magazine  That's all we needed to get by  Now it seems things have changed  I think that you're the one to blame  Dear penis 
[01:32:30]  I don't like you anymore  Now he sings  Now he sings  Dear Rodney  I don't think I like you anymore  Cause when you get to drinking  You put me places I've never been before  Dear Rodney  I don't like you anymore  Why can't we just get a grip 
[01:33:00]  On our man-to-hand relationship  Come to terms with truly how we feel  If we put our heads together  We'd just stay home forever  Dear penis  I think I like you after all  Oh, and Rodney  While you're shaving  Shave my balls  She's heard it before 
[01:33:30]  I'm Myra Lopez  With The Hollywood Report  You know, it was definitely, like, made fun of  Lake Bell says she was endlessly teased  About her first name growing up  When you're a kid  And that's  I mean, you're asking for it  I mean, I got, you know  Can I take a swim in the lake?  You know, I got, like, lakes got no waves  You know, I got Lake Erie  You know, Lake Titicaca 
[01:34:00]  You know  But she had a couple comebacks  I'd always come back with Lake Superior  You know, Great Lakes  Bell says her first name  Is actually a family name  My great-grandmother was  Was nicknamed Lake  I think it was a last name somewhere  And my mom was raised by her  By her grandmother  So it was kind of like  I was named after her  Bell's new show Boston Legal  Was spun off from the now-defunct  The Practice  Bell says the show's  A completely different feel  From its predecessor  It's a lighter, funnier  Faster-paced  You know, sexier

[01:36:00]  Hello, hello  Oh, there we are  You're checking out  The Opie and Anthony show  We got the instant feedback  Cranking today  You can get to it  Through OpieandAnthony.com  I do believe  Toolbag writes  From New Orleans  The Mr. Clean Ed  Was actually Jimmy  With an earring on  Cleaning an ass  With his tongue  Ass munching  Making a very big comeback  We learned that  Last week on the  Radio show  Big comeback  Is it a comeback 
[01:36:30]  Because was it big  At one time  And then went away  And came back  The quote was  Ass munching  Making a big comeback  Comeback  Like it was big  At some point  And then  Kind of went away  And now it's  Having a resurgence  A resurgence  What are these pictures  One thing I hope  Doesn't ever make  A resurgence  Is the huge  Giant 70's  Earth Mama Muff  Well  I guess Eric  Had found some  Last Tango in Paris  Pictures online  And printed some out  For us  This is the lovely  Maria Schneider  From that movie 
[01:37:00]  Her and Marlon Brando  She's extremely lovely  Until you get  Below the belly button  That is just horrific  It looks like a toupee  Man  There is so much hair  In her lap  It's a pool rack  Filled with Afro hair  When she's sitting down  On the sink  In this one picture  Look it looks like  She's wearing black panties  Look I swear  Oh I know  Oh wow  You're right  It looks like  She's wearing black panties  And then there's a close up  Of her snatch  And it's just this  Real thick nasty hair 
[01:37:30]  You know what sucks  This style will come back  No  It certainly will  In the lesbian community  Perhaps it's back  Most girls  Doing the clean shave  These days  But I guarantee  This damn thing  Is going to come back  I don't know  I just hope I have  Alzheimer's by then  I just don't want  To see this ever  That's like  That's what I remember  Growing up  Looking at in  Nudie magazines  Though  That was it  Girls just didn't shave  It was  You know  You're a kid 
[01:38:00]  You're thumbing through  Maybe some of the magazines  You found  Someone stockpiling the woods  Remember walking through  The woods or something  And you  What's that  Did I see a page  Or something under those leaves  And you look  And just find this  Bounty  Of nudie magazines  And they were all like that  And it was great  At the time  You didn't know  It was supposed to be  Shaved down or anything  You saw that big nasty hair  Oh a little bit's okay  That is just horrifying  Oh  It is just horrifying  So  And a little bit's not okay 
[01:38:30]  It should all  Be removed  You just want it  Completely removed  All of it  I like it kept  In the natural shape  But a little tamed down  It can't be that  That nasty thing  I don't like the strip  The landing strip  It's too stripper  It's like every  Dopey stripper  Has that god damn  Landing strip going  And the Hitler mustache  Is  It might be cool  If they're standing up  With their legs together  Oh I know  What you're about to say  Because the second  They spread them apart  Or lay down on their back  It's this 
[01:39:00]  This patch of hair  That's just  Completely out of place  It's too high up  It's too high up  It's away from all the  Junk that's coming out  And it's too far away  From the belly button  So it's just like  This patch of hair  You're so right man  It's this little  Postage stamp of hair  Speaking of chicks  Steve's in the studio  From foundrymusic.com  He also does  OpieandAnthony.com  And occasionally  He also works  For the Opie and Anthony  Show  When he's not too busy  He was emailing me  Like crazy  I'm sure Anthony  Got the emails as well 
[01:39:30]  And he's very excited  Because he thinks  He has found some girls  That will come in  And break in  The wiffle ball bat  Finally  Oh yeah  We're trying to get  The wiffle ball bat  Broken in  The wiffle ball bat challenge  What's going on  With the couple  With the girl  With the flow  By the way  She was supposed  To come in today  Ben  We can call her  Her boyfriend  Went back to school  And she doesn't  Want to come in  By herself  Well I don't blame her  You see the freaks  Walking around this joint  So Steve is like  Well I don't think  We can count on  That really lovely couple  I mean the girl  Was beautiful  She was what  No she probably 
[01:40:00]  Will show up  She was like  21 years old  Or something like that  Blonde  Beautiful  And wants to break  In the new  Wiffle ball bat  Anthony  Well Steve's like  Well I don't know  If that's going to happen  But good news  I found some girls  In Jersey  That are drug addicts  That'll come in  And do it for us  Well look  Well they're doing  Drugs in Jersey  And they get the bat  In the snatch  Look  We've been doing this  Long enough to know  That the porno chicks  That come in  Like the really highbrow  Vivid girls  Generally that come in  Aren't too keen  On putting  In their snatches 
[01:40:30]  You need a little sleaze  Yeah exactly  To get the job done  You know in the past  Couple years  I've made some contacts  We have learned that  Wait I want to  I want to interrupt you  We have learned that  You assume like  The porno girls  Will come in here  And do anything  They all have morals  We learned that  The ladies of the night  Even have some morals  Some of them do yeah  Some of them  We couldn't get those girls  To do anything  I mean we made good radio  Outings last week  I don't think it's morals  They're making serious coin  Doing what they do  So you know  I think when they  No hold on  It is morals  No I don't think it's morals 
[01:41:00]  I'll explain why  Alright I'll explain why not  We have a huge radio show  That promotes their products  Yeah  So they are getting something  Out of coming on our show  They never see  So why would they do  Something for us  You're too close  To radio  To realize that  These dopes  Don't even realize that  They don't see it  As a money  Like worth money  That they're going to be  Making something  Out of an appearance here  They see it as  They're doing us a favor  And they will not  Do it for nothing  Right  They're not going to  Do it for nothing 
[01:41:30]  It has nothing  Morals  A big black dick  In their ass  Just the last afternoon  And they come in here  And won't put a bat  In there  I don't see it as morals  I see it as  They're too cheap  The girls know  Show up  Get naked  Screw  Collect a paycheck  End of story  That's what the girls know  The guys on the managerial side  Yeah but then you bring out  The wiffle ball band  And they're like  Oh my god  No way  Watch that morality  That's disgusting  Watch that morality  Go away  If I peeled off  A couple of hundred  That was going to give it to her  Exactly  The morality would melt 
[01:42:00]  Right away  We're going to have to  Test that someday  Because I'm telling you  They got their limits too  Nah  That's what I've been noticing  With the porn stars  The money it would cost  To get the porn stars  The porn stars  Anthony's right  They would do it for money  It would just  They might want $500  Which means they got morals  They got their limits  Morals are not dictated by money  That's what morals are  Everybody could have their morals  Broken down with money  No but I'm saying  Morality and money  Are not supposed to be  It's not supposed to be  But I do believe  There is definitely a connection there  But go ahead Steve  So you found some drug addicts 
[01:42:30]  In Jersey  That are going to come in  And do the wiffle ball  That challenge  Over the past couple years  I've befriended a number  Look how nice he is  Now on the air  You want me to read the emails  Dude I got chicks  That are addicted to crystal meth  And this and that  Will come in and take  The wiffle ball bat up the age  Well look you're not going to  Find fucking road scholars  That are willing to take  A wiffle ball bat up the ass  But now you're just being  Like very diplomatic on the show  But the emails were hilarious  Dude I found some skanky hoes  That'll come in here  And do whatever we want  The vast majority of girls  That are getting naked  And taking loads on their faces  Are meth addicts 
[01:43:00]  I mean  These are not  There you go  That's the Steve we want  These are not  That doesn't hold back  These are not  Straight A fucking students  These are girls  That would generally be  Injecting heroin  Into their fucking eyeballs  You know  If not for the fact  That somebody was paying  Them to get naked  And getting cornholed  In a cheap motel room  Those are the ones you find  In those gagged videos  Exactly  Oh those are hysterical  There's a band of music playing  And there's a dog  Humping their mouth  Wow wow wow wow wow wow wow  That really maniacal 70's stuff  Just a nice pink dog mule  In their face  Showing them who's boss  All right  The guy's got her by the hair

Yes  I stalked him and waited for a long time  Jim and his pictures  Yes  Uh, Henry  Henry  Hey, what's up, man?  Hey there, Henry  Long time no hear from  Well, yeah  I worry about you, Henry  Over at AAF  When it used to be a radio station  When you were there  They were going to find it, Henry  Oh, they weren't going to find it 
[02:13:30]  Wasn't that on TV over the weekend?  Dude, they put Goodfellas on Lifetime  That's the chick station  Yeah, they shouldn't do that  It's like Bridges and Madison County  On Spike Television  That's where you need to use  The parental controls on your TV  So your lady can't get the Lifetime channel  Why did they put  I don't  Isn't it supposed to be a woman's movie?  They put one of those  Goddamn Marky Post  I was raped  Or my husband beats me movies  Because they were trying to show 
[02:14:00]  Women were trying to show  That they can get down with the boys too  And now they have WE  Which is Woman's Entertainment  When are you going to realize  That if you didn't have tits  You'd be completely dull  When is that going to hit you?  Your programming is soft  And it stinks  They play all those movies  All the chick flicks  The Bridges and Madison County  Fried Green Tomatoes  Play that one  Play Sophie's Choice  They're originally made for TV movies  Oh yeah, the ones 
[02:14:30]  They gather up all the mothers  From the various 80's TV sitcoms  All the mothers  That want to branch out  Into dramatic roles  And the stories are always  They meet a guy  He seems nice  But after a while  They find out that he's a scumbag  In various ways  Either he's cheating on them  Trying to kill her  Raping  Watch these movies a lot  Yeah  You know, you gotta watch one of them 
[02:15:00]  He knows all the plot lines  To know what it's all about  On Lifetime  I marry the scumbag  It's always the same gag  There's a new one now  About the Abu Ghraib prison scandal  It's called  The Lindy England Story  Starring John Larroquette  As Lindy England  What a hottie she is  Oh god, that awful fat  Her head is thinner at the top  And it just goes into this  A pinhead  Mushy dog face  God, is she awful  But a good girl  But you know, she would just 
[02:15:30]  Do anything you ask of her  Yeah  If she's stacking up Iraqis  And it's sicking dogs on them  And taking pictures  The guy with a leash  You know, it's easy enough  To just grab a hold of that  Cute hair of hers  That little bob she's got on her head  I couldn't believe it was  The Dorothy Hamill haircut  The Dorothy Hamill  She's got the Dorothy Hamill  Hey, so  How was Goodfellas on Lifetime?  Why would you even bother?  You know why?  I think a lot of us do that though, right?  The game was coming on soon  Right  There was nothing else on  So I'm going around the channels 
[02:16:00]  I see Goodfellas  And I stop  Then I realize  It's on regular television  And it's on Lifetime  And I figure  I'd grab the DVD  But the Yankee game  Was coming on  So I didn't  But I've done that  Plenty of times too  Where you see a movie  Come on, a good movie  It's on regular TV  And they're cutting the crap out of it  And you're pissed off  Because the language is  Much better when they don't cut it  But no, half the fun  Is getting around the language  Oh, yeah  It's when you can't say the words  Oh, oh, oh, oh  Yeah, I love hearing Pesci say freaking  How many times did he say freaking 
[02:16:30]  In that movie?  So why don't you just pop the DVD in?  Because I guarantee you  Have Goodfellas at all  You know why?  I don't know why  I do that  Sometimes you go through the channels  A movie comes on  That you have on DVD  It's right there next to the TV  It's right in the rack  Just got to pop it in  And you sit there  And watch with the commercials  And it cut apart  It was awful  Yeah, freaking do, bro  I know why they showed it on Lifetime  Because there's that one scene  At the end  Where she's walking  And De Niro's trying to show her  Where her free dresses are  And all these kvetching whores 
[02:17:00]  Are sitting home  Thinking of how nice it would be  To have a man give them  A place of free dresses  Maybe we could just  Stretch that scene out  And show it twice  Right in there  No, no, no  Farther  Right in there  No, there  Oh, come back  That awful actress she is  How do you ruin The Sopranos?  God almighty  She makes Asians look fun-filled  And expressionful  She is really awful  She stinks  Anytime she comes on 
[02:17:30]  On The Sopranos  I think America  Let's out a collective  No, because HBO  Is commercial free  So they put that in there  So you can go get a beer  That's the commercial?  Oh, that is the commercial  Every time that comes on  It's time to go see  What's in the fridge  Oh, without a doubt  Because that's what sucks  About commercial  Oh, there's the pen thing again  Sorry  Oh, yeah  Oh, boy  We heard about that  Over the weekend  Oh, that's what  Yeah, that's what that scene's for  They're not stupid  They know you need to get up  And maybe take a leak  Or get a beer or something  Dr. Melfi  So they have that two-minute scene 
[02:18:00]  In every Sopranos episode  So you can get up  And stretch the legs  That's the only reason  It's there  You know who else  Could have done that role  As well as she does  Blair's cousin  From The Facts of Life  That's who she is  She's Jerry  Why do you think  You feel that way  You monotone twat  God, is she awful  And that's such a  Brilliantly acted show  The mother to me  Was the best thing  On that show  I mean  You know  Go shit in your head  That's the funniest thing  Anyone's ever said on TV  And then you  Counterbalance it  With this dead weight 
[02:18:30]  It's just  The dull moments  When they switch to him  In that god damn  Psych office  But he's fine there  At least he's a great actor  I mean  He's good  You can't even appreciate him  Yeah, he's not fine there either  You can't appreciate him  Because every other line  It's her  Yeah, I disagree  But I think he's good there  Because it shows a side  It doesn't  Of the mob  Like it shows this guy  Who's just going through  These awful family problems  I like it  Yeah  But her, oof  Hey, Henry  Why did you call anyway?  I'm sorry  Hey, the best line  In that movie  Smokey and the Bandit  Oh yeah, that 
[02:19:00]  Where he says  What does he say?  He says  Remind me when I get home  To punch your mama  Right in the mouth  Yeah, the good old days  Yeah, because  There's no way  You came for my loins  He says  Yeah, that is a good line  And there's a line  They actually edit  You can see  It's the worst editing job  I guess they did it  For a PG rating  But when they bust  The other cops  From the whorehouse  It's the worst dub  And Gleason really says  Next time  Wear your badge  On your dick  But they put in  The word diety  Wear your badge 
[02:19:30]  On your diety  And you can see  His mouth go dick  And they've never fixed it  I guess back in those days  They had to do it  It's the worst dub ever  Oh, they can't quite  Dig them up now  Hey, I got a new one  From Tampons  New slogan  Have you heard that?  No  No, we may not be  Number one  But we're up there  Oh, we're right up there  Oh, my goodness  Oh, my God  You did not  Just break that joke out  That is really old  Oh, my God  Henry, you were doing  So well  You heard that before?  Oh  You were doing so well, Henry 
[02:20:00]  You've been courteous  And receptive to courtesy  You established trust  With the embarrassing truth  About tampons  And then this ham-handed  Segway into your joke  It won't do  All right, Henry  Thanks  Let's say hi to Bruce  In Toledo, Ohio  Hey, guys  Love the show  Thanks, Bruce  I want to give a big old  F you to that  Lifetime channel  My wife watches it  Constantly  And I'm always bitching at her  Can't you turn that shit off?  But I find myself  Wanting to know  Who the fuck the guy was  That raped the girl  And if he got convicted 
[02:20:30]  You know, sir  My wife  Used to do everything for me  And leave me to my writing  She's always yelling at me  Saying, you always tell me  To shut that shit off  But I can't get you  To turn the fucking channel  You know  Use the parental control  That's right  All right  Well, you guys suck  Thank you  Okay  Bye, fella  There he goes  One more  And then we'll move on  To something else  Ryan from Jersey  Go ahead, Ryan  They show that  The good fellas  On the Lifetime  Because it shows  The story of 
[02:21:00]  Karen, the wife  Who puts up  With all the  The bad  You know  The bad thing  That goes on  In Henry's life  And how she's there  For Henry  And she guides him through  So I think it's  A strong story  And how in the end  She's a strong woman  Yeah  And that last scene  Where she  Dumps all the coke  In the toilet  And Henry's going crazy  And he's crying  And Karen's there  To console him  After they lost  $60,000  And that's all  I had, Karen  And she's there  Holding him  That's justifying it 
[02:21:30]  Like playing it on  BET  Because Stax is in it  How, by the way  How good does  Samuel Jackson's cheeks  Look in those  Little bikini  Underwear  That he shot in  Stupid bastard  With the truck  Geez, what an idiot  What good cheeks he had  Firm and ready  To work for hours  Anthony, I got another  Unlucky lottery  Or sucks to be you  Story  Oh, wow  They're just coming  Out of the woodwork  Unlucky to be  The husband

[02:28:30]  When they're younger  And first start going out  Before they get married  Then the first step  They get married  After marriage  Something happens  Now they're in a legal binding partnership  That all of a sudden  Her humor is a little different  Things get a little more serious now  Now it's not just you're going out  Something happens  You'll break up maybe  Or go out with somebody else  Now you're in it for the long haul  So we gotta get serious  And things change  All of a sudden  Things aren't as funny as they were 
[02:29:00]  You know those goofy jokes  That they used to laugh at  Not quite as funny anymore  Then the piece de resistance  Of killing your humor  The kids  The kids come  You give her a banging  The pill wasn't working  The condom broke  Something happened  Now you got kids  And the woman's  Sense of humor  Completely disappears  Oh  Oh  The guy will fool you  Into thinking you're still funny  Or thinking that you still 
[02:29:30]  Have a sense of humor  But believe me  He knows  Your sense of humor  Is gone  Gone  In your younger days  You probably would have laughed  At this drivel  On this program  I bet  You and your guy  Driving in the car  You tuned into this  He's laughing at something  You'd start laughing  Maybe you find it a little funny  But you want to kind of  Keep him happy  And not make him think  That you're a stick in the mud  So you laugh at it  He's laughing  You're all laughing  After you get married though 
[02:30:00]  And especially after kids  It just goes away  She does not find you funny anymore  She doesn't find the stuff  You find funny anymore funny  It's over Johnny  And at what stage  Does your wife start looking like  Your best friend Bob?  Oh  She cuts her hair off  That's later  Oh my god  For any wife out there  But also it just happens  Like wait a minute  You roll over one morning  And go  Holy S  You know something?  Short hair  If you're 22  23  24  That's cool  That's very cute 
[02:30:30]  It's cute  On some girls  Some it's not  Some girls can pull it off  Get away with it  Once you're  Something happens with these women  They get up into the late 30s  Early 40s  Next thing you know  They cut all their hair off  Because it's just easier  It's easier  Now I can spend more time  Cleaning the asses  Of my little kids  And it's  It's  It's a guy  And you wonder why  Your men are going  To the strip club  Right  You now look like  Their best friend Bob  He wants to see  That long hair  Brushing the top  Of a stripper's ass  Not the 
[02:31:00]  A haircut  That he sees  On his  Working partner  At work  He sees it  On his  Plumber's helper  The same hairdo  On his wife  That isn't right  That one I don't get  All of a sudden  They just  Give up  And just chop  All their hair off  Give up  That's the word  They give up  And they wear jeans  And they tuck  Their shirt  Into the jeans  With a pair  Of smart  White sneakers  I don't know  If you've seen it  Did you see  The mom jeans 
[02:31:30]  On SNL  SNL is one of the  Funniest  Big commercials ever  Hysterical  So accurate  It has the pleats  In the front  So it automatically  Gives a bunt  A big bunt  That's the  Big bun  Over your  Twat area  And it  Offers the  Extra room  For when you  Tuck in your shirt  To store all that  Extra material  On your  On that belly  That baby  Ravaged belly  Hope you enjoyed  Having those kids  It just 
[02:32:00]  Wrecked  It ruined  It ruined  Everything  You're not going to  Understand until you  Have one of your own  That's what they say  All of a sudden  When you have kids  It's like you slept  Next to one of those  Bean pods  In Invasion of the  Body Snatchers  Everything was fine  You were going along  Having a good time  And people were married  And you were calling  Them assholes  People had kids  You were calling  Them assholes  You fell asleep  Next to the bean pod  All of a sudden  Your body crinkled up  Into some webs  And the bean pod  Turned into you 
[02:32:30]  And now you have a kid  But it's the best thing ever  And you wanted  Other people to enjoy it  And say  Hey  Wait till you have them  You'll enjoy it  If you walk around  Talking about  What the joy of having kids  What you're doing  Is you're taking lemons  And you're making lemonade  You couldn't have been happy  That she  Yeah forgive my  Pardon my French  I'm going to open this  Hall like this  You couldn't be happy  That your social life  Is ruined  You couldn't be happy  You can't be  You have to justify it  I'm sorry 
[02:33:00]  You just can't  Trade in  The pleasure  Of having those kids  For the trade off  Of having a wife now  That just pays attention  To the kids  I've seen it  I've seen it  You were the number one guy  In her life  Remember those days  Anything that went on  You were the guy  Now there's  There's another guy  And there's a little girl  And there's other people  That are much more important  Than you  How do you know  All this stuff  Because I see it  I know of one of your marriages 
[02:33:30]  Were you secretly married  To someone else  And had kids somewhere  This is not  My personal experience  This is me looking  At the world  That's what I do  I look at things  You're an observer  I look very closely  I study things  You're also a satirist  Yes I'm a satirist  From the planet Saturn  Yes  I look at things  And I see  And I just know  Basic human nature  I know what guys  Are like  And the fact that  They justify  The kids and the wife  You know you're 
[02:34:00]  Having fun  And I'm not talking  Hey having chicks around  Is great  You know  When you're just going out  It's beautiful  When you can hang  When you can do  Spontaneous things  When at the drop of a hat  You can hop on a plane  And go somewhere  You can just do  Whatever you want  It's not  It's not loading  The car up  With cribs  And play pens  And toys  And you are nothing  But the sperm donor  That now pays  For this crap  And drives it around  And any  Any pleasure  In the relationship  Is gone 
[02:34:30]  Pencil in some sex  Hope the kids  Aren't awake  Duct tape the doors shut  So you can maybe  Get five minutes  A piece  Before the crumb steal  It starts banging  I had a nightmare  Can I sleep with you  Remember when  Can I sleep with you  Got you all hot  Because it meant  You were getting laid  Now it's  You gotta have a little  Rugrat in between you  Are you channeling  Your dad  From the past  Probably  Because he took off  Like a bat out of hell  For California  He sure did  Never looked back  Never looked back 
[02:35:00]  My father  At I think  Thirty five years old  Decided he wanted  To be a god damn  Cowboy  And he moved out  To California  Bought some horses  And that's what he was  He was a cowboy  And it was a pisser  Going out there  Had horses  Everything  It was great  God bless him  Because  The thought  Of having to hang around  And cart around kids  And a miserable wife  And I'm sorry mom  I know you're not  Well  She was pretty miserable  And the miserable wife 
[02:35:30]  And the damn kids  When you know  You just want to have fun  No one can have fun anymore  Wow  There's too much responsibility  Wow  Wow  Wow  Alright  How did you feel  When your father left  That's my  That's  That's my  That's my  Scene stopping  Awful Lorraine  Bracho  Wow  Oh  Just the whiny  Just no  How can you be awful  And expressionless  At the same time  It's mind-moggling  He stood me up  Shut up 
[02:36:00]  You have a whore  In your building  There's a whore  Living in your building  Kurt  What's going on  Hey  You guys suck  Thank you my friend  Hey listen  Don't forget  When you open up  Those mom jeans  And you look at that stomach  And it looks like  A Ziploc bag  Full of tapioca pudding  Hey  Some girls  Know how to  Snap it right back  Into shape  But that's the  Exception to the rule  They know how to  Go to the gym  Do whatever  They need to do  To work that off 
[02:36:30]  But a lot of women  They don't care  They don't care  Now  Their lives are devoted  To these little kids  That they  That they thrust on  Everyone  Everyone  Now we gotta deal  With their kids  In movie theaters  In stores  Everywhere  Restaurants  It's their problem  If they want their  When I'm sitting in a restaurant  And I'm trying to  Enjoy my meal  And there's a little  Piece of crap  Running around the tables  I look around 
[02:37:00]  Going  Who is  The thoughtless  Piece of crap  That owns  This monster  Well the parents  Think their kids  Are cute for everyone else  That's the problem  Right  They look  And they smile  And go  Look how cute he is  Thinking everyone else  Is thinking the same thing  Cute to you  And your husband  And maybe  90% of kids are ugly  And maybe some of your family members  We don't want to see them  But the rest of the world  Hates your kid 
[02:37:30]  Your kid is annoying  To everyone else  But you  So stop it  If they're running around  A public place  Enough  Chain them up  Some people  They don't care  Most of them don't care  They're stomping  And they can't beat them  Anymore in public  That's the problem  At least the treat  You're not allowed  To hit your kids anymore  Occasionally  You'd get a parent  That would whack  That kid upside the mouth  And you would hear  A blood curdling scream  And I would laugh  My ass off  Every time 
[02:38:00]  We all got whacked  Growing up  Look at us  We're normal  You know what I do still  When a kid gets disciplined  For doing something  And I do the like  Say we're at the supermarket  And there's a little kid  In the cart  And he's doing something bad  And he's being obnoxious  And the mother yells at him  Or gives him a little spank  On the ass  And he starts crying  I'll wait till the mother  Turns around  And I'll look right  At the little kid  And point at him  And go  Ha ha ha ha ha  And he starts crying  It is such a thrill  For me to upset children  Wow  Whack  I never got hit 
[02:38:30]  With a hand  Ever  There was always  An implement involved  Always  Yeah  I mean we could do  An hour on this  I used to get  Spanked with the  Hot wheel tracks  A hot wheel track  That is brutal  Wow  The wooden spoons  Wooden spoons  Well the legendary story  In my family  This is the truth  When we did something wrong  And it was time for a beating  My dad would send us out  In the yard  To bring in a stick  So he could hit us with it  And of course  You really are Opie  Aren't you  That sounds like  A Sheriff Andy Taylor  Thing to do

[03:38:30]  reading reviews on it and a lot of people that whole stuff you know i i got hooked at on sims when  it first came out like potato chips and it was all cool and it was different but what it came  down to you just wanted to bang broads in your neighborhood in the game you just want to bed  the women that's what the game's all about in the game and they shouldn't sugarcoat it anymore they  should just have an x-rated version of sim city it would be the hottest game ever well now that's what  these guys want to do and these girls when they're playing this game they just want to have sex in their  little cyber world well they figured out with the hot neighbors and you know part of the sex angle 
[03:39:00]  they figured out sort of so well it's getting there it's getting there but it's pretty good  you're you're really but the thing is you gotta build up some kind of relationship when they have  sex are they still pixelating it and things like that they show a cut scene um of some sex going on  under the covers of the bed do you get to see cyber junk no but i'm sure there's a patch you can see  them when they're um when they're in the shower and on the toilet oh no this is kind of cool pictures  from last tango in paris why are you playing the sims game uh because i am uh up to date with 
[03:39:30]  20 uh 21st century entertainment gym that's better than getting the ass flu i don't mind  21st century but it's like dude all you do is 50 bucks i can play a game and not have to stick  my tongue up someone's ass play some chess chess all right grandpa i'll get the old chess board out  find out where i plug it in and set up the monitor it's it's a game it's uh it's a game  you you get your character and you go in a house and you have to then build relationships with these 
[03:40:00]  characters these people you bring them into your home you entertain them you you find a a mate or a  girlfriend or or you could just try to have sex with people in the neighborhood and uh you build up  your possessions your money your uh relationship you have the fears in life and your pleasures and  goals and things and then it's kind of like potato chips you can sit there watch tv and and uh play the 
[03:40:30]  sims well i mean it's kind of like we like here's where you roll the dice and you move forward a little  bit in your life and then sometimes you take a tumble back and you have to re-roll the dice a lot of  people call it shoots and ladders but i call it shoots and ladder i have a hot sexy steamy story  about shoots and ladders yeah i was playing with a girl hunts back in 1968 she was five more sexy teen  news horror no it's a game it's a get you just don't criticize computer gaming of any kind because you are 
[03:41:00]  so out of it you are so not even close to this century when it comes to modern entertainment but  he used to be into the computer games and the oh he's got his picture in a newspaper for playing  what how old were you i was 13 it was super bowl sunday 49ers against the bangles uh we have a big  star in the studio today yeah he was in the newspaper yes i little j little jimmy norton as they call me in 
[03:41:30]  the paper i was uh and played asteroids for 10 hours not a world's record asteroids that's right but i was  13 hours 10 hours yes in the arcade and you didn't get killed oh of course i got killed but i had 480  ships silly goose i eventually did die though and you have uh the record for that or no but interesting  enough two pictures oh you didn't even set a record no i thought it was some kind of world record that's  why you were in the newspaper it was like bobby and cindy on the seesaw no it was like no no it was 
[03:42:00]  i was actually the mr brady for disguising his face as bobby's side of the seesaw that was the record i  actually two pictures over for me record though i mean there's up ozzy osborne for biting the bat's  head off oh really what a coincidence you're a big ozzy fan yes it just funny how little things work  so you enjoyed video games when you're growing up when did it drastically change i don't even hate  video after monster rain or no monster rain started before the asteroids long before i'm trying to put  your whole life together i'm making a jim norton lifeline a timeline when did it all go horribly wrong 
[03:42:30]  because i've seen that picture you look like a cute little kid happy normal adorable but something  happened somewhere yeah maybe in devil's creek in edison yeah where i used to hang out with angelo  and rafael and we would just break we were such destructive we would take like the like these big  half a circle sidewalk metal grates and just throw them through people's bay windows and run there was  nothing fun about our vandalism it was take a huge chunk of metal and throw it into a living room and 
[03:43:00]  run away really nasty sorry uncaring so sim city uh sims sims two sims two right yeah sims two and  then uh you could you could have sex though but you got to hook up with the girl and then you got to  kind of kind of hang out kind of you know a little bit of why do they have to eff it up in the  flirting why do they have to eff it up in the cyber world too that you have to build up a relationship  yeah you got to build it up and i've played the sim you gotta you gotta uh invite him over to a 
[03:43:30]  little house party or dinner you have to have a little chit chat on the sidewalk gotta be chit  chatting you gotta record you can obviously a woman invented this game work your way up a guy did not  invent sim and hug games and joking with each other and then if they start liking each other you can see  it on a little meter at the bottom if they're they're kind of digging you a little bit then you could go in  and try to you know make out with them or or do something uh in in the bed you know ask him to sleep  over or something and sometimes they just leave you know and then you ruin it and it's very hard to 
[03:44:00]  build up a relationship with that person again is there ever a scene in the sims game where they fall  asleep and then get shot the next morning in little bikini underpants  wouldn't that be good you could set up scenarios in this game though i take the coffee with you  i'm kidding put the fucking coffee pot back oh yeah you could set up scenarios though i played uh  my my uh sim character turned into a serial killer i made him a serial killer i had a really cool house

[03:48:30]  and that's how we talk and i moved to florida and the kids used to make fun of my accent they're like  they hey kids say something hey what do you want me to say so you become aware of your accent  so it's not really sticking but the weird thing about the new york accent there's no logical way  the new york accent could have been conceived no logical way first people in america were who  united states were who danish all right we have a different textbook than we did because  it was an indian thing i don't know maybe you're missing chapter one or your abstinente  we forget the indians but i know what you meant yeah and you're right in a sense if you just like 
[03:49:00]  wipe wipe off the indians like we did many many years ago you know that's an easy way to figure  that but you were the good thing is like you're ready with the answer right away you know you  didn't you had 10 or 20 seconds before the buzzer was going to sound but you were danish you know  what i mean unless you're ordering from the bar and i didn't you know you know what i mean it's like  danish they're like oh the timing was impeccable you know but uh uh yeah um but anyway so but the  the first people in america were indians and their accent is nothing like new york and the first 
[03:49:30]  people to settle in the in the united states in new york were british people and their accent's  nothing like new york the dutch well the dutch they they that's didn't stay long they went all  the way down to bowling green they couldn't find parking because they fucked off and went home  that's what happened with the danish it's really true but the british actually were the settlers and  they um and uh but no matter what there's no logical way the accent could have been conceived  because even if it was indians and danish how did kimosabi and like all right turn into  opioids joe you know what i mean right there's no natural progression anywhere unless Christopher

[03:50:30]  we find a bad sensor and replace it unfortunately this is usually not the case once we find the  affected circuit we then embark on a fact-finding mission this mission might include measuring  electrical values across electrical contacts components or wiring artists i've seen loose  electrical connections cause a car to stall alternators not to charge  starters not to start a car and on it goes quite often a wire breaks within a harness that  hundreds of other wires are packed into what we pay the diagnostician for is to sort out each
