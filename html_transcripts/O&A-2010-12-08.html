<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opened with the hosts expressing their annoyance at the absence of their interns, speculating on the reasons behind their no-show with crude and offensive jokes.  They blamed various parties, including their supervisors, and vented their frustration at the lack of communication. This was followed by listener feedback, leading to several callers being banned. The show then took a surprisingly serious turn with a discussion about a documentary on PTSD in soldiers, prompting heartfelt, though still interspersed with vulgar humor,  accounts from the hosts about the struggles faced by veterans.

The conversation abruptly shifted to a scathing critique of Yoko Ono, her art, and her relationship with John Lennon, featuring the playing of audio clips and sexually explicit comments about her appearance and work.  The hosts also engaged in a comparison of Lennon and McCartney, favoring the latter. This transitioned to a brief mention of the movie *Skyline*.  The next segment began with more nonsensical jokes about Yoko Ono's singing before descending into crass commentary about the death of Elizabeth Edwards and John Edwards' infidelity.  The hosts also discussed the physical appearance of John Edwards and then transitioned to anecdotes about former staff member Eric Logan, his struggles with substance abuse, weight loss, and his current employment at Harpo Productions.  This involved stories about Logan's drinking habits and a minibar incident with Bob Eatman, highlighting Eatman's frugality and his wife's resourcefulness.  The conversation meandered into complaints about Manhattan traffic, leading to a discussion about expensive vintage concert t-shirts.

A significant portion focused on speculation about the sexuality of the "American Pickers" hosts, analyzing clips from the show with sexually suggestive commentary and playing a comedically edited promo for a fictionalized version, "American Fuckers."  This was followed by a lengthy and sexually explicit discussion about "Straight Stunting" magazine, its female models, and the hosts' preferences, interspersed with a listener call-in.  This discussion continued into another segment, alongside a lengthy discussion about WikiLeaks, Julian Assange, and the implications of the released documents. This segment featured studio guest Mike Baker, a former CIA operative, who provided insight into the complexities of the WikiLeaks situation. The discussion included humorous, often crude and sexually explicit, commentary on the women in "Straight Stunting" by the hosts and Baker,  Jimmy's complaints of chest pains, speculation on Dr. Steve's 1975 band "Moonage Daydream," and a discussion of an NFL player's career change to a train conductor.

The final segment included a discussion of the US involvement in Afghanistan, with Mike Baker providing input based on his CIA experience.  This segment also delved into rumors of CIA drug trafficking, references to MKUltra, and a bizarre, drawn-out argument about the pronunciation of Sting's name involving a studio employee named Mars.  Discussions of the hosts' upcoming stand-up shows, a caller's criticism, and a humorous anecdote where a call was abruptly ended, implied to be an intentional silencing, concluded this portion of the show, along with jokes about the pornography Mike Baker might have on his computer.

[00:02:00]  that there's an uprising i think is there an uprising there's a uh yeah a strike  they're unionizing are they yeah yeah do we have an answer where the interns are answer second time  this week so we're assuming they were told to stay home oh are you serious i wouldn't doubt it that's  what i'm assuming what there's an assumption being made wait interns are just staying home now  what is the day off will someone please tell me what the fuck's going on around here gotta take the 
[00:02:30]  day off sometimes you're a little tired right sam what do you know none of us really know exactly  what's going on because they keep like ever since thanksgiving like every single day interns are  calling out sick or they have to go to work or like today nobody i haven't heard from anybody  how many interns we still have uh today we're supposed to have three and all three called out sick  none of them no no it sounds like one of those uh the blue flu when the cops uh call out sick  not about calling it just didn't show up yeah today nobody's heard from so wow so so so to the 
[00:03:00]  dopes that kind of babysit the channel could they at least let us in on what the fuck's going on  because we need interns to run the show see there's a lot of little things that we need done every  morning you just said they that's the big problem what because it's like could they tell us what's  going on there's not a they there's someone no but they're hidden behind no fucking wizard of  no no egghead who do you want egghead man from the future man from the future  has the has the title of head babysitter he's head babysitter is that do you think that and then 
[00:03:30]  he reports to steve blatter who's actually a radio guy that knows how to do this shit but uh egghead  futuristic man he's he's the head babysitter so why doesn't he tell us what the fuck's going on  we can't just do a show without uh interns vincent price from batman that was uh egghead sure  how do they how do they go through their day and and decide like major shit and not tell us 
[00:04:00]  like the studio wasn't set up we didn't have newspapers all dumb little things that probably  the listeners could give a shit about but it really helps the flow of the whole uh radio show  stuff you get used to having so you don't uh think about if there's a if there's something going on  you know that's up to those guys but at least tell us what the fuck's going on because tom is good  the black the black dude tom is uh i don't know you i don't know most of them he's he's great he's  here but he's one of them that didn't show up why can't you just say tom is good and we could assume 
[00:04:30]  who it is because the listeners may not know who he is because we've only had him in once why not say  tom the good intern yeah because that was the tall guy tom the guy that's probably good at  basketball you know you tom the girl i'd never let have sex with my daughter the girl i'd never  let have sex with my daughter did i say that you certainly did well i'm very early i'm tired i have  tranny dreams you have tranny dreams no i'm just kidding uh again might not be a management thing i'm 
[00:05:00]  here and we just don't understand why interns stopped showing up here but wouldn't the head  babysitter know that isn't he on top of what's going on with his channel he should have known  it yesterday knowing his that's right but this isn't just a uh this has happened a few days in  a row now well it's been a weird i haven't seen an intern in almost a week i think it's been a  weird thing because yeah they've been very there was some here yesterday yeah i was here yeah  i apologize then but then ray our intern looks like george harrison oh you could call him ray 
[00:05:30]  could someone wake up egghead and ask him why suppose so why not if he's the head babysitter  and we have an issue we need an answer so wake him up how ridiculous is that he's supposed to be  awake every day at six he might be awake that was the deal that was made with steve blatter at least  at least have the babysitters awake just in case we have a question that was the deal that was made  imagine that question imagine that question equals meeting okay good breaking news one of them 
[00:06:00]  showed up all right good so maybe there's no conspiracy oh you can believe that i believe the  interns are turning against the program all right so at least no one told him not to come in good  yeah but why would an intern just show up at 6 15 what is going on maybe there's a problem  oh that guy showed up oh she's oh she doesn't want to play man i'm telling you i didn't say  shit that's why i didn't want you to even say that play though man i'm telling you i was like 
[00:06:30]  she doesn't want any part of this shit no no that's fine yeah why don't we just leave all that  yeah that's exactly what i meant i'm saying not even take a little dig nope uh all right well  maybe there's not a problem with the interns they're just showing up late i don't know yeah i don't  know either one of them shut up i mean you are fucking blocked right now you're i'm banning you  why what i love how they don't like tardiness yet they start the show at 6 12 you know what 
[00:07:00]  then go listen to something else bye bye fuck dick bye bye everyone say goodbye to that fucking  asshole take it easy bouncy bounce and banny ban not even just bouncy bounce where he gets in later  banny ban to the to the people that still have a problem because now we're doing about a four  hour show every day i still want to do one less hour each so that's two hour that'd be great  two hour show and then we have uh like sam they just hired dr laura for millions of fucking dollars 
[00:07:30]  to do a three hour show okay millions a fucking boatload boatload of money so stop the bitching  she's funny though that's where she gets to do three hours and guess what i bet you she squeezes  it on both ends so it's less than three hours where is she broadcasting from who gives a shit a  boatload of money is very inconvenient depends on the size of the boat and what the denominations are  you gotta go to the dock and pick up your pay and how do you get it off the boat and then you gotta 
[00:08:00]  take it all to the bank they're all singles that'd be uncomfortable and who knows like if the boat's  there the proud it is a lot of it would be wet yes the bills where is it on the boat maybe it's on a  shipping container that would be easy like those hookers in season two of the wire  holding fucking money in their dead fingers yeah that was that was an ugly fucking container  that's the way to help a situation out though sure all right well we'll figure out what's going on  with the interns just showing up late and we tried to have a meeting like our plan a week and a half 
[00:08:30]  ago was to have a meeting with the interns but we haven't gotten any days where they've actually all  been here to have a meeting with really yeah is that ain't no one knows if this is a thing  i mean it's just a we got a thing going on here called gary and ask him is there a thing going on  a thing because if there's no interns here he needs to step up and be an intern you think  he needs to give himself a promotion and become the fucking intern until we figure out the intern  program oh the internship program tell himself to give himself a promotion technically get my 
[00:09:00]  fucking coffee and my fucking newspapers and put my chair in my fucking place is he uh filming a  sequel to star trek's menagerie you know what the menagerie he's on a plane going straight nosing  straight down there's a lot of there's a lot of secrecy going on right now is is the point we're  trying to make a lot of secrecy there's no interns dum-dums gary's saying they were not told to stay 
[00:09:30]  home now the girl's here so why are they not showing up and he should get to the bottom of  that conversation we'll have with them when they're here who didn't show up today i'm surprised tom and  ray which one's ray looks like george harrison because he didn't show up oh that guy with the  long hair yeah he hasn't showed up here i don't think since thanksgiving he's had it oh he's not  he was a nice guy he still emails and says hey like yesterday i got an email from him at four o'clock in  the morning saying i'll be in tomorrow he wants to come in at his leisure what's wrong with that he 
[00:10:00]  seems to enjoy the radio show yeah that's that's the current generation they don't really want to  work hard at all leisure mommy and daddy kind of fucking you know coddle these uh these kids in this  generation they don't need to work too hard because they all they all understand a world where  everyone gets a trophy all the all the ass that's at that that marymount school that have from go to  i wouldn't be coming here either oh is that the deal yeah they're dehydrated from all the sperm  they're shooting a lot of a's over there yeah i heard i heard it's a good ratio and like half of 
[00:10:30]  the guys are elite alternative lifestyles so oh oh really wow so there's a lot of sex gone  lots of cornholing going on oh gay guys just love blowing each other sure what you're doing you have a  little time left that's really not the point i was making but oh yeah oh i'm sorry damn you're  saying that you wouldn't come in if you were an intern you'd be sucking cocks at that school  until the cows came home as it were  all right i guess there's sort of not a problem they're just not showing up 
[00:11:00]  but no one's getting to the bottom of why there's definitely a problem i just don't know how or when  it's ever going to be addressed yeah who addresses that who's supposed to address i used to hire  interns i don't do that anymore but shouldn't someone go to egghead and and tell them look  there's a problem with the interns could you get to the bottom of this because the guys kind of need  the interns around to do some things the interns aren't in well that's very bad  where's my modulator  is he gonna walk around with his coffee cup that's not even full well if he finishes it 
[00:11:30]  wouldn't be full he walks around with an empty coffee cup it's really disturbing this is a viable  thing uh can we still blame steve uh c let me think it would be blaming bush for a long time yes  you know steve c left us with this the problems with the interns we had before before i mean these  are steve c is the one that left us with this problem and uh the cleanup process is a long yes 
[00:12:00]  it's very difficult road we could start the show because this is what i have to say oh gary there's  a problem with the interns because this is what we hear too sometimes i i i didn't even know there  was an issue well now you know there's an issue with the intern i didn't know there was an  issue oh my and by the end of today i'd appreciate it if you figured out what the fuck's going on  thank you now we can move on with the radio show 
[00:12:30]  my ludium q38 space modulator  how do you remember everything  he remembers everything  jesus all right oh my god i was that's a good one  yeah i was singing a horrible fucking commercial jingles to myself the other day this is what kind

[00:25:30]  confetti and fucking whistles and streamers at the docks these people are just slowly coming home  fuck ha ha hooked up who took away the parade you think lawyers what the praise and everything the  parade oh the parade you think lawyers got their hands on and said look we can't have parades anymore  bush kept a very tight lid on what was happening during the war because he didn't want uh people  the uh public turning against them he saw what happened in vietnam when people saw body counts and 
[00:26:00]  films of of death and and didn't want that to affect this war i think we got carried over now where  people are still fucking dying i believe 2010 had more deaths than every year combined  then every year combined i think it after watching the special and after hearing after hearing these  world war ii vets talk it's like it's easy to say like you know back then they were tougher  howards the pussy generation but all of them like those soldiers all of them said like there was no 
[00:26:30]  mental health there was no therapy it's like all of them could have used it like all these guys that  we we looked up to our grandfathers or our fathers that didn't talk about shit it was bad they didn't  talk about shit it's like we're not this faggot therapy generation it's like all this stuff actually  is good shit it made me actually like us more now because of all the shit that i saw that they didn't  get they were just supposed to deal with it and that was the whole thing of the uh and they showed

[00:27:30]  uttering a word about it and he's balling like a motherfucker they they sat on this shit for  50 years these fucking guys the shit they saw and went through it wasn't that whole glorious  thing that the uh the newsreels showed here they are taking over the japanese look every american wins  it's like no they're fucked up that's part of the generation where you didn't talk about your  emotions though too exactly that's that's why yeah that's why it happened we all have uh the older  guys in our families and they don't talk about shit i love the soul right they keep it all to 
[00:28:00]  themselves you don't really see older guys ever crying none of that none of that crap you watch the  specials though any military special you watch on uh the old wars korea world war ii uh you'll see  old guys just welling up talking about their buddies and like it was yesterday and and it's they talk  about guys that were 18 19 20 years old that were right next to them that just died and this many  years later it affects them like it was yesterday because it wasn't just oh my friend died in a car 
[00:28:30]  accident and i was able to grieve and do this it was in front of their face they exploded  and they had to then deal with that and go about their business still the one guy was in the planes  in world war ii i don't know he's a pilot or a co-pilot but he said that whenever you see one get shot  down you'd look out and see how many fucking how many shoots popped out yeah because then you knew  how many bodies were going down he said if you saw a bunch you knew people a lot of people surviving  yeah sometimes they just see one or two shoots sometimes none and the plane or none and the plane's  just spinning down big explosion yeah dead guys and these then they get back to the base they land 
[00:29:00]  and then these guys are just gone they you just were talking to in the morning now they're gone  how do you fucking how do you deal with that i mean we joke about people we can't stand in this  place and everything but imagine like you come into work one day and it's like oh yeah they're dead  it's like oh five people yeah they're they're just dead a boy could dream and then there's just  new people in there and yeah and you might be the one the next day but it is fucked up it's just a 
[00:29:30]  and it's not addressed enough in in this country about uh returning soldiers we want to we want to  embrace the glory and the uh rah-rah patriotism of america and our might and how we can go in and take  care of business and we never want to address the problem that it causes of people coming home we  always want to think of that action movie war hero that can come home and just take up where he left  off and be a strong guy when meanwhile that's the exception to the rule for the most part these guys 
[00:30:00]  are coming home to a fucking nightmare how do you drive down the street when a couple of months ago or  maybe even weeks ago the mailbox might have exploded how do you pull up next to a mailbox or  another truck or anything when a few weeks ago it just might have exploded and killed everybody  and hearing these world war ii vets uh could i have a diablo sandwich and a dr pepper make it snappy i'm in 
[00:30:30]  a goddamn hurry uh hearing these world war ii vets talk about like uh it's hilarious i like to explain  that to the people that it's a movie for us yes it's a movie uh uh hearing world war ii vets say  like i was uncontrollable when i came home drinking driving getting arrested it's like just like guys  today it's like it's just amazing to me that the soldiers that were exactly like soldiers now but we  just see them as old people like oh god that guy who's a tough old son of a bitch we don't realize 
[00:31:00]  that that guy was waking up at three o'clock in the morning with fucking drooling and screaming  because he fucking saw his friend's legs get shot off yeah freaking out it really it humanized a lot  of older people and it made me like this generation more that like yeah you know what therapy is soft  and fruity and talking about your feelings but all of those guys probably wish they could have and does  it but does it help that's what i'm wondering like does it help because the suicide rate is 
[00:31:30]  astounding and i don't know what it is compared to world war ii veterans right um you know per capita  because there were a lot more well joey pants was gave us some uh big numbers the other day it's  out of control yeah it's it's completely really out of control as far as suicides if his numbers  were correct in uh in the military uh these days but i wonder what it is in comparison with world war  ii vets that came home and then you know you take the numbers because obviously there were more  world war ii vets than there are um gulf war vets or this version right um so i i really wonder 
[00:32:00]  uh how many more people now are killing themselves percentage wise i don't know i mean it's a good  question does the therapy work um are enough people getting it like because it seemed to me  watching because i watched a few of these documentaries on people that that come home and uh are fucked up  and and you wonder like what what happens 44 000 men and women have committed suicide since the iraq war  began but is that 44 000 now is that just men and women in the united states uh just in the military 
[00:32:30]  men and women uh committed suicide i would assume in the military uh the u.s army did not keep figures  on troop suicides until 1980 wow okay that's interesting well there you go i think that says it all  yeah there's one soldier who should probably blast that tuft of hair that fucking those weeds growing 
[00:33:00]  on his head leave him alone hey look it's a personal opinion fucking nut he's a lunatic leave him alone  please i was a former governor i was shell shocked thermite shock that's special though that guy  that special forces guy who was he's training talking about his kid it was because these are tough  people the whole family and it was just like up till then they were mother was a soldier tough soldier  family it's like and all proud of like the fact that the grandfather was in and he was and uh you know 
[00:33:30]  and then he's just fucking there's oh oops there's one that kind of couldn't be the the the soldier  that the whole family had been meanwhile they probably all have such fucked up shit going on  but have just kind of put it to the back of their head or forgot about it and then after that i was  crying watching that my girlfriend's like oh you're a sap but she knows i am and then a minute later 
[00:34:00]  we're watching the end of fucking six cents just flipping through the channels oh no what part with  the bicycle yeah like and he's in the car talking about your mom and the b and the thing and the kids  yeah and the mother starts crying and i cried again yeah well it was already there but but you  when you were crying over the the uh the documentary right yeah what she wasn't affected by that she  well she was just teasing me but no she's a i mean she's a cyborg she's a that's fine that she's  teasing you but she has to be affected by the terminator she that shit will bring any person down no 
[00:34:30]  she cries when she thinks who she's stating when we fuck she cries no she cries during arguments like  she'll cry when we're fighting i won't as a defense mechanism i don't know she gets sad to  shut the argument down no she'll get sad like really say certain things or if she says certain  things that's where her weakness is tv nothing it's it literally is like watching tv with a pet rock  no emotion watching tv wow but other times where i don't have it she does it's weird that's a little 
[00:35:00]  strange yeah she just doesn't very rarely does she get sad if i don't ever see her watch it cry  the soldier shit gets me and and the way they do because it's always the same it's the the rough  and tumble rugged old guy yeah and they show the young picture of him he's talking about what he  went through and then out of nowhere he's like yeah and uh you know kowalski uh left the uh landing  craft and i was right next to him there's always yeah geek and and then it's like uh no and i'm 
[00:35:30]  watching like no oh shit that's very sad what happened to kowalski it wasn't good yeah kowalski's  head exploded like he didn't start his own business no kowalski never went home so the documentary is  called war torn 1861 in 2010 yeah okay it's gonna be on hbo uh december 15th 1 30 p.m i believe or  check check your hbo you can on demand you can on demand that one yeah i think you can on demand  and we found the george carlin thing i think we should play it's like two and a half minutes george 
[00:36:00]  so it's a genius bit i don't i don't remember the rest of the bit i watched the box set of band of  brothers scott fishman is asking me i watched that it's fucking they have a lot more uh uh film of the  actual soldiers from easy company and what they went through and and after watching the series you see  the actors portraying what happened and then you see the actual soldiers right and what you know you  know what they went through by watching the the uh miniseries and they talk and just get busted up 
[00:36:30]  and and you realize because they they film a lot of these guys from the chest up and you don't know  who's who and during the show you see some guy get his legs blown off and then there's the guy they pan  out they they they pull back and show he's the guy with no legs and he was you know and now he's got to  talk about how that felt and what happened and how he lost his legs but other people lost their life and  that matters to him more than his legs it's just fucking tragic the whole post-war thing is really  um i don't think we address it enough we want to kind of just sweep it under the carpet when the war's 
[00:37:00]  done yeah man there's really not enough uh uh care for these guys well we got the george carlin bit  that jimmy uh let's check this out i don't like words that hide the truth i don't like words that  conceal reality i don't like euphemisms or euphemistic language and american english is loaded with  euphemisms because americans have a lot of trouble dealing with reality americans have trouble facing  the truth so they invent the kind of a soft language to protect themselves from it and it gets worse with 
[00:37:30]  every generation for some reason it just keeps getting worse i'll give you an example of that  there's a condition in combat most people know about it it's when a fighting person's nervous system  has been stressed to its absolute peak and maximum can't take any more input the nervous system has either  snapped or is about to snap in the first world war that condition was called shell shock  simple honest direct language two syllables shell shock almost sounds like the guns themselves 
[00:38:00]  that was seventy years ago then a whole generation went by and the second world war came along and the  very same combat condition was called battle fatigue four syllables now takes a little longer to say  doesn't seem to hurt as much fatigue is a nicer word than shock shell shock battle fatigue  then we had the war in korea 1950 madison avenue was riding high by that time and the very same combat 
[00:38:30]  condition was called operational exhaustion hey we're up to eight syllables now and the humanity  has been squeezed completely out of the phrase it's totally sterile now operational exhaustion sounds  like something that might happen to your car then of course came the war in vietnam which has only been  over for about 16 or 17 years and thanks to the lies and deceit surrounding that war i guess it's no 
[00:39:00]  surprise that the very same condition was called post-traumatic stress disorder still eight syllables but  we've added a hyphen and the pain is completely buried under jargon post-traumatic stress disorder  i'll bet you if we'd have still been calling it shell shock some of those vietnam veterans might have  gotten the attention they needed at the time i'll bet you that oh we are so unpredictable 
[00:39:30]  oh oh oh shit you shouldn't have sang that i actually this is one of my favorite john lennon  songs yeah solo songs yeah i like the little drum line here yeah yeah it's good it's got a good 
[00:40:00]  little beat to it i love the horse shit that is imagine let's all just sit around and imagine i can't  stand his last album that whole fucking yoko tribute  bullshit woman i can hardly explain it was a love song it was a love song for yoko break upper  i don't think i don't think you should just sit around imagining double fantasy 
[00:40:30]  what what happened what happened nothing it's fine  no i have no idea what i did sorry i'm very excited today you're extremely excited it's fine  big john lennon fan well i i am yeah kind of you didn't like the you didn't like the love song  woman no i don't think you like the lennon stuff in general did you no i was a little too weird i was 
[00:41:00]  more of a growing up especially more of a poppy guy yeah i like the pop thing going on  and uh uh mccartney was more pop sure lennon was just a weirdo like i couldn't get into his  shit he was a hardcore liberal which i which i don't think you would like no was paul mccartney  a liberal i would think so not as much vegetarian thing with uh his wife but uh i don't know i i just  like musically not even politically like musically uh i don't know paul mccartney wings it was like 
[00:41:30]  very hit oriented and then john lennon just seemed to put these songs out that were just weirdos songs  a whole album of just noise with him babbling and her fucking caterwalling in the background  what about uh them naked in bed uh that was really disgusting a little rough right that was pre um hair  maintenance and they were very hairy people both of them god why why does the world hate yoko so much 
[00:42:00]  because she's yoko she broke up the biggest band ever yeah you know you feel like glennon could  have done better or something that's another thing yeah bad to say oh my god what the fuck it's like  hey let's take a picture of us just standing there naked oh with a lot of pubic hair yeah there's so  much pube oh john and yoko wow john wasn't packing huh well you don't have to be when you're right as  well as he does is he unclipped yeah yeah but i guess if he would have shaved down the pubes it 
[00:42:30]  would have made his piece look a little bigger like four soft you think that's four soft yeah  maybe like a white picture of uh frontal nudity she had nice tits though like she had big i like her  kids the nipples are pointing down i like that and this is when she was relatively still young i like  that big nipple look they're pointing straight down those are nice tits you guys can go jump in  the lake i'm sorry you could even tell in the pic like they're flat and pancakey yeah yeah that's 
[00:43:00]  horrible i just don't like the hairy body when she's on her back they just kind of spill off to  the side yeah that's terrible they get lost like under the armpits they're udders they're udders  my problem with lennon there's a lot of dreaming going on there a lot of imagining  yeah and and not much doing by the people that are still imagining if you know what i mean oh  they just like lennon did a lot in his life but he's left this song imagine for people to imagine  but they're not really doing anything maybe he imagines his wife was really hot yeah imagine 
[00:43:30]  there's no hair on the pussy i think that song uh yeah it's a little rough to you make come true  of course imagine no religion well that would be nice good luck to you there but that's impossible  yeah so you got to work with what you got is what i'm thinking i thought working turkey tits  was a better song what would what would it take what would it what would it take for there to not  be a uh religion anymore what would it take really discovery of alien life would have a big part of 
[00:44:00]  it you think yes they would at the the religious zealots would absolutely say they were sent by god  i'd say that'd be a part of it religion is a lot less powerful even though i know we see islam and  all that shit but in if you see a western civilization cultures it's expect the idea that it's  shit is expanding it's a very slow fucking bleed but it's happening people want to build their own  conveniences of their life into the religion and the religion is very strict so unless you're orthodox 
[00:44:30]  and and really adhere to the rules of the religion uh because a lot of catholics all of the rules just  change like uh condom use just recently the vatican was talking about um condom use in africa  right uh to curtail aids and that never would have come up ever ever any kind of birth control  yeah but but because of circumstance it changes but it shouldn't change i'm not saying it shouldn't  change i'm saying yeah religiously uh what the ideology says is it shouldn't change a religion should be 
[00:45:00]  as strict now as it was when it was first written but that's one thing these fucking islamic extremists  that are actually doing uh right is they're just taking it verbatim but and acting like savages but  to keep with the question what would make religion completely go away no one action it's the more  things that get proven that we attribute to god like the earth is flat the sun revolves around the earth  the more things that are scientifically proven to not be true you couldn't the more it etches away at that  belief people need hope for something no i understand all that but what would make it go 
[00:45:30]  away would it be alien i mean really think but look at where we are right now aliens coming down  i think that'd be a big part of it and proving that look we made you fuckers they'd make something up  humans can't take the idea that it ends so they have to make up a story that can't stop you can't  convince somebody that once you die it's over if they want to believe in something but if they  understand what the universe is and they understand like we're all just energy if if the if science 
[00:46:00]  and becomes it becomes common knowledge of certain things like nobody really argues i used to get  these guys arguing the six thousand year old earth these assholes but nobody argues that the earth is  flat anymore there are certain truths that they would have argued or they would have put you to death  for in the 1600s and now it is common fact so i think the more we learn and the more people become  disenfranchised with religion the more they're exposed as being human and fraudulent right but  very slowly it happens we need something really big to have alien people to you know stop alien connection 
[00:46:30]  aliens have cut it down but i think a lot of people would see it especially the real crazies would see  it as a a sign from god but we would knock down the numbers oh god yeah we would knock down the  numbers drastically yeah what about what what's some of the other lyrics in uh that damn song about the  imagine there's no country yeah yeah what what would that take no country no borders no nothing  just it's happening slowly one world one people who what would really throw that over the top  aliens nuclear war where we have to come together and fight the aliens yeah you know what it's always 
[00:47:00]  about the aliens i play your aliens so fucking lenin wants aliens to land yeah yeah but no it's like  you look at the european union or look at the fucking uh yeah that's true they're talking about  making north and south america like all these weird conglomerations becoming one monetary unit  eventually it'll be one well this guy goes the return of jesus would end all religion why there's  people that don't really believe islam might reject them the jews might think it's his first  time showing up why don't they stop right it wouldn't end religion yeah catholicism would look 
[00:47:30]  and go like oh okay i'm into that but every other religion would be like hey i've been i've been  paying attention to this religion all right i'm gonna stick with uh my guy i'm gonna stick with my team  yeah my islanders oh boy anyway well all right so the country's uh thing would go away with aliens  an alien attack yeah or just an alien how about an asteroid oh of course big huge  motherfucking asteroid that's gonna destroy the the world in in uh in 20 years uh do we that would 
[00:48:00]  look do we come together as a fucking world people would look or we'd argue we would argue right until  uh the damn thing hits us right on the fucking head but people would become more religious thinking  that that was like us uh armageddon you know oh you're right yes the world kind of thing uh rapture  whatever you want to fucking call it yeah didn't he say that imagine there's no heaven yes oh boy but  that's the whole religion thing like hey there's no heaven there's no hell there's no nothing there's  here there's now let's just love each other let's love each other with our hairy genitals 
[00:48:30]  just fucking twining together god that must have been matted together when they  fucked our two dogs uh two fucking gripping like velcro two irish terrier backs  horrid yeah so independence day has to happen yeah exactly yeah that's what we need something  like that from medford aliens would really cure a world or ills literally it would cure a lot of  shit yeah because how do you you know start worrying about iran and their missiles and stuff 
[00:49:00]  when you got uh some pretty well-armed aliens they can't be stupid like aliens that just kind of ran  out of gas and stopped here right it's got to be aliens with some weaponry they got to be well  organized and not good enough weaponry that can uh kill us in one shot well what aliens would you go  with you don't need a planet killer what aliens would you go with there's a lot of aliens from uh  the movies i like which ones you like close encounter aliens right but a little more violent man  not so willing to chit chat uh with a fucking keyboard something uh a few guns a few ray guns 
[00:49:30]  things that we can uh fight off sure and if we united not those aliens like a planet planet killing  ship you know death star shit that's how you fight that what aliens can we easily fight off  easy to fight off uh i think even the little gray guys are our pussies yeah yeah everyone's  scared of them because they're the little gray guys but one kick to that fucking big balloon head 
[00:50:00]  with those and how easy to just pull a fucking three stooges on them with those giant eyeballs  the the easiest aliens to defeat in movie history was the ones from that dumb fucking shama llama  ding dong movie we're all all signs yeah all we needed was a little rain a little water a little  water a little rain seventy five percent of the planet covered in it yeah good luck yeah good luck  what were those dummies thinking they didn't even come with umbrellas no nothing i always like the  fact that like obviously there's always moisture in the air so like why weren't they just melting 
[00:50:30]  everywhere they went like hurting or at least just like ow this this fucking atmosphere is annoying me  there's actually an answer for that oh i don't have it but there is an answer for that it might just  be he didn't think of it yeah now that he's long gone i need to know how bad was that movie skyline  oh speaking of aliens oh my god who's gone it tanked so bad yeah i didn't say it but i heard  what was it what was the problem with that movie does anyone know it was independence day  that they released in 2010 and i heard the acting was abominable uh the story stunk on ice and the 
[00:51:00]  special effects every single one of them you saw in the trailer who's in it they packed it just nobody's  you said now that he's gone uh brett ratner maybe you were in la oh no i wasn't here for brett yeah  he was in he's a great guy he comes on the show every once in a while but he was yeah he was  promoting this movie and you could tell how he's promoting it that he was uh not believing in it  either he pretty much straight up was said that it was a business deal like it's like it costs 10  and it'll make you know whatever it makes it'll make enough and yeah skyline how much did it make 
[00:51:30]  the fucking trail looked uh it doesn't matter as long as pretty good i'm sure opening weekend it  made back what it cost and then between itunes rentals and and uh you know dvd sales and all that  stuff and yeah it'll make a ton of money what else was in that imagine song um religion imagine  there's no countries no country no heaven we figured that one out uh i guess no pubic hair  no pubic hairs in the song say anything about money no hats no hats jimmy would not like that at 
[00:52:00]  all i forgot about that because uh jimmy likes how about some how about updating it imagine there's  no ball cancer imagine there's no aids imagine there's no fat chicks stinking up the club with  their thigh sweat imagine there's no marmalade oh that would be bad imagine there's no ass sweat  oh no possessions yeah so you don't own any anything you don't own anything so how people can't fight 
[00:52:30]  over their possessions would be jealous how far do we go back with that because loincloths well  cavemen they had they had shit do you think people went like wow that's a better loincloth than mine  i'm gonna beat him over the head and take his loincloth yeah don't fuck with my rocks my rocks are  better than your rocks that makes a great spear he makes a great spear so you need possessions just to  live so that's impossible too yeah because someone's always going to be jealous of what you have of  course but how does that change how do you just give up all your possessions you can't i think that 
[00:53:00]  how song was aliens again aliens have to uh take all our possessions and give us something that we  don't need possessions for why do people love this so much you know what else it's the matrix yeah it's  the matrix you're actually in a little pod generating uh heat and energy for uh machines and uh you don't  have any possessions you don't have any uh real borders or anything and you're just uh walking through a  computer program so i think uh john lennon was very uh ahead of his time really with uh the matrix 
[00:53:30]  imagine there's no stank box ah well imagine there's no psychopathic uh fans ah imagine there's  no instant feedbackers imagine there's no dog shit under your shoe same thing  uh yeah he's uh i guess ahead of his time with this dumb fucking impossible song i would say i think  working-class hero is a better song though i prefer i imagine it's good but i thought working-class 
[00:54:00]  hero was better it's just me yeah i'll take that to the grave with me oh you will i'll yell it angrily  at anyone who's smaller than me or in a wheelchair i just like the poppy songs i liked uh all we are  saying is give a little repetitive a little bit repetitive i got a little lazy with that one his little  christmas tunes are right around the holidays that i'll take where yoko whispers before the song starts i hate  go go with frank does she whisper in it yes happy christmas war is over christmas in england happy 
[00:54:30]  christmas war is over don't say merry christmas i don't know the but she leans over and goes yeah  she really was an artistic valueless idiot i don't know did you ever see rock and roll uh circus  amazing how she sucked to this day i thank jay moore for turning me on to that or curse him no the  greatest fucking rock documentary ever rock and roll circus there she is let's sit back and listen 
[00:55:00]  to some yoko wait could you stop this to really bring this home you got to get the visual because  you got to see who's on this stage when she starts this horseshit it's rock and roll royalty and no one  is brave enough to tell john will you will you get her the fuck off the stage we're having a really good  time right here because he would they they're probably afraid he wouldn't do who was there some of the guys  from hendrix uh you had yoko you had some of the stones clapton trying to remember everybody uh uh  uh was a jethro tall there yeah the jethro tull tony iomi was on stage from sabbath he was on stage 
[00:55:30]  too he played with jethro tall he left sabbath very early on and played with tall very briefly and  went back to sabbath right uh kent the movie guy everybody oh kent is back hey guys i just wanted to  uh say why skyline sucks so bad it's uh basically you have your independence day movie but the whole  movie takes place in an apartment complex and never leaves there ah okay so it's like independence day  in a movie theater building uh there what's his name was bragging that the whole movie was done on 
[00:56:00]  a computer so yeah yeah it had a 10 million dollar budget and it made about 20 million domestically so  it made its money back but it still it just sucked every character was a douchebag everyone was  completely unlikable and all the action was seen through a fucking telescope like uh uh cloverfield  except out a window right cloverfield uh if those fucking things came to earth we could we could  defeat them that's you think they fucking they weren't dying for shit that's some easy shit what 
[00:56:30]  yeah they're gonna destroy they shot him with missiles and everything and nothing worked and then  they had the little things that jumped off of them yeah i think we're fucked with cloverfield  monsters could they remake cloverfield without that without the shaky cam just like a real movie  that movie had major potential with the yeah you're right the shit that just fell off the  fell off of them in the subway and they're fucking chasing them that was some creepy  they were obsessed with making everyone uh carsick in the movie shaky running around yeah god if they 
[00:57:00]  just would have like downplayed that a little bit that would have been an amazing movie i think and  they would at least need another one to do is i hear what they want to do is uh do it as a documentary  and have soldiers tell their perspective kind of like that book world war z oh so it's like the  same after the fact yeah the same thing is happening but it's a different location with different  people right yeah you get different footage from different people talking about it all like blue  shift on uh fucking uh half-life oh wow exactly like blue all right ken very good job so we're 
[00:57:30]  gonna hang up on you now there he goes don't hurt his feelings no he's very sensitive  clapped in yeah so they decided to do the big jam at the end of rock and roll circus they're all  stoned and then yoko has to come out and fucking just start screaming you don't know if this is the  i don't know is it the end of it i think so yeah i believe it might be the i think i think this clip  is somewhere in the middle of it okay if it's a jam going on it'll take forever you know these 
[00:58:00]  guys love their jams but then uh i forgot who uh who was responsible for rock and roll circus  but the jagger i think was a jagger they made everyone wear fucking rain  shit in the audience they're wearing snuggies he was ahead of his time too  snuggies and uh and supposedly everyone was just tripping their balls off  i think he didn't like the way the sounds came off in this at all i hate the hippie but i think he 
[00:58:30]  probably didn't that's why that's why they didn't sound like shite i think they didn't uh release this  for many many years oh they didn't that's why yeah i i think they weren't happy with it how it  how it turned out in the end they like the concept but uh it is kind of silly have you ever seen this  thing oh yeah yeah you get the who out there doing their shit no the who came off well there's a  michael jackson there mick shagger all right well well irak's got the the wailing here's uh what yoko 
[00:59:00]  did make a joke but i'll leave it i'll leave how he's fighting it because he keeps getting nicked  by those spears well sorry ruck bad one huh bad one huh but in the middle of this uh all-star jam  she had to come out and and do her thing and no one was brave enough to tell john lennon look this  really sucks oh it's awful 
[00:59:30]  oh she stinks  did she think this was good verna just he was a john lennon with  pussy whipped i think so too i think you're right how you brought this in the back

[01:05:30]  no just uh  today  with a  a shitload of security  and then everyone loses their  fucking minds  she walks in the dakota to strawberry fields  which which is a very short walk  places her rose and and walks back into the  the uh dakota  i think she does that pretty much every year  why did he why did he have to shoot him  fucking uh  why um  and elizabeth edwards died  which was sad 
[01:06:00]  why is nobody talking about what a  piece of shit her husband was  oh  while she was getting chemo  not that i wouldn't have fucked rielle  they probably all have their um  but where's  you know  yeah well  their skeletons  oh yeah but i'm saying it's which is fine  yeah  she turns out to be like just  the nicest woman ever  yeah  so he looks like the biggest piece of  and believe me  if i was taking a chick in the chemo  i'd be fucking someone too  i'm garbage  but we know i'm garbage  i didn't want to be president  i  yeah true  i saw john edwards uh 
[01:06:30]  running in the park central park one time  he's running over the whole country  he was  yeah  his head  his head is so  fucking large  is it really  he's got a massive  fucking noggin  he's a twat  it's fucked up they were just talking about how uh  she wasn't going to continue treatment that the doctor said it was pretty much you  know  eh  there's no use in continuing uh  uh  it's pretty much down to weeks  that she has um  and then the next day she's dead  yeah  wowie  hey someone's gotta 
[01:07:00]  he looks like fucking elo  a little bit  john edwards has an elo look to him  yeah  especially that one oh yeah  elo's probably got less scruples  i love the elo  yeah  i love eric too but he really is  garbage personified  i like remembering him as the piece of dirt he was  yeah  before he stopped drinking and actually cleaned up his act  exactly  for oprah  stop going to the gym  what are you doing  yeah  take some cough medicine 
[01:07:30]  make bad decisions here  drive another truck into something  you think he worries every day that he's gonna be found out by oprah  oh god  and oprah finally is gonna walk in on him  oh  and he'll be  as he's drinking from a flask  as he's drinking  and he's on the phone  still playing with this fucking sound machine  wow  that guy  gotta find an older picture of him  that guy erased his memory of the opium anthony show at this point  oh he did  he's pretty much the main guy at harpo now  yeah  he has moved up since he left 
[01:08:00]  he was the guy  he left for a great gig at harpo  and he's moved up since then  and he's unrecognizable  he's lost so much weight  well he was a little bloated from the alcohol i think  you think  boy could he get hammered  one of my favorite times  with eric logan was in bob eatman's hotel room  after we did  was it letterman  i don't know  we did so many  it was one of them  and we came back to watch it  it was letterman 
[01:08:30]  yeah  and we came back to bob eatman's room to watch it  and me and elo  cleaned out bob eatman  cheap bob eatman's  minibar  sure  of all the booze  sure  and beer and everything  he was horrified  that was an expensive two days for bob  because he also had to pay for the restaurant bill  yeah the restaurant bill  yeah there is a resemblance  more so with the uh  when elo had kind of that hairdo going  he cut his hair a little more  yeah  but um  yeah he was  oh my god  was bob like  look  bob was just looking 
[01:09:00]  his eyes were darting around the room  looking at us  every time we opened the minibar  like oh  you knew he was just adding it in his head  i told you  i i learned years ago  that his wife's not allowed to use the the minibar at hotels  yeah  and and she was brought up in beverly hills by the way  oh  so she's used to like being treated right  and then she marries bob who  who watches his money very closely  yes  and when they go uh  away she's not allowed to use the minibar  so she has to like 
[01:09:30]  she goes shopping  and gets all the stuff that  might be in the minibar  and brings it to the hotel  and brings it to the hotel  which is smart  but not convenient  what a chiseler  chiseler  it's like i i get you don't want to fly the whole family first at expensive  but bob's been making enough money for years  he could uh  give himself a little treat  exactly  he doesn't know how to uh  enjoy himself  exactly  don't  go out and cheat a little bob for christ's sake  cheat  you're kidding  he is so out of his fucking league 
[01:10:00]  with his wife alone  that he don't want to blow that  you know what  you're right  oh god  pick up a male escort  his wife is beautiful  he must look at and just go like  i don't know how i did it  but i better not fuck this up  really nice woman  and really nice looking  yeah  i believe a jewish bride  oh yeah of course  he's not gonna marry a shiksa  did you  i can marry shiksa  what day are we up to  gentile  where's the suffering at today  uh  are we almost done  it's the last day 
[01:10:30]  last day  is it eight  that means they're gonna be back on the streets  yeah  damn it  they were back on the streets yesterday  they were  even they give up on the whole suffering thing  yeah they got tired of it  i guess  yeah it was kind of brutal yesterday  oh really  you noticed the difference right  yeah  well december is tough in the city anyway  but i find the days to be kind of hit and miss  december sucks in manhattan  i mean look everybody's coming in to see a dumb christmas tree  which is  right up the road  they don't give us  it's a christmas tree  i gotta pass right by it  it's a fucking christmas tree 
[01:11:00]  well when we leave it's not that bad  like when the show's over  it's not that bad  i used to try coming in here  like back when saturday virus was in like full effect  and i was coming in here every saturday  november december  it  like i had to leave my house literally two hours  like i had to give myself two hours  two hours  to get into the city  great  it was ridiculous  it was fucking infuriating  you cannot  it's gridlock  like literally  gridlock  like you just  you idle your way to your destination  i go north  so you gotta  like when i get out of here  i actually go west immediately  and fucking go north there 
[01:11:30]  we actually go south two blocks and then west  oh you do  yeah it's so bad  this is a bad time of year  i just want to repeat everybody  i forge forward  east  forge east  down one lane roads  and just  beat my horn  i'm gonna have to get a horn replacement  i wonder how many  uh  new vehicles  have to have their horn replaced under warranty  that'll be me  i'm so angry  i wish i was skinnier man  i do  this is what i'm doing  i'm 42  and i'm looking at sabbath and ozzy 
[01:12:00]  concert shirts  and i just wish i could fit in them  aww  jimmy  dude these are expensive  the one's like 625  do calisthenics  why is it 625 dollars  what  was bought the night before  the show before randy died in 82  it's a very hard to get shirt  that's sabbath  that's 750  but this one  and it's mint  it's never been worn  never been washed  it's a 30 year old shirt  who would know to fucking save that  and that war shit  i remember that shirt when i was a kid  it's worth that much  or is it some asshole  trying to sell it for that much  i don't know if it's worth that much 
[01:12:30]  but it's worth something  i wouldn't pay that much for it  you wouldn't wear it  you'd put that  oh i'd wear it  i'd wear it  no  you'd put it in one of those  hard rock cafe shirt  frames  yeah but i want the back shown too  oh how do you do that  i know  you put it on like a little thing  you cut the shirt in half  oh my god  say that man knows  why not  you hang it like a mobile  why not  you hang it like a mobile  and just let it spin around  the biggest concert shirt  is a zeppelin shirt  it's a very rare  shirt that they gave away  during a show 
[01:13:00]  which it counted  it was like  it was your backstage pass  it's worth like 25 grand  25 grand  can i see that  it's an ugly shirt  oh fuck that  hold on let me see  never pay 25 grand for a shirt  yeah put up  most expensive zeppelin shirt  i forget what it's called  but it's like  led zepp it says or something  it's  it's like a blocky letter  it's a soul soul  no  a soul soul  hold on  led zeppelin  i would think 
[01:13:30]  any zeppelin concert  tea that  is actually real  and in good shape  would probably be worth  some money  no the top ones  are zeppelin ones though  yeah  yeah  led zepp  someone just got banned  for saying  stop bitching  and take a train  the tsunami  blocking continues  hey shithead  the tsunami blocking  continues today  do you think i want to  stop bitching  and take a train  let me hop on a subway  sorry that we're  relating to people  go to fucking  i think everyone  could understand  uh uh traffic 
[01:14:00]  get on a train  and the nightmare  that is this holiday  it's nebworth  it's called  take the train back  and then fucking  hop in my vehicle  and then drive home  anyway from the train station  fuck your mother  ten thousand dollars  i'm sorry  ten jeez  i said ten  towards my line  i apologize  a little nebworth  nebworth yeah  wasn't that a festival  or something  yeah i remember that  yeah yeah  i remember the name  nebworth  which one is it  i saw  i've seen one  it's ugly  that was never worn  uh and they're probably 
[01:14:30]  very cheap shirts  look at the back of it  you can tell they're  probably just like  these chunky shirts  but it's from 79  rare  is it that  that's five and  five and a quarter  is it that  nebworth from 1979  that's not the one  no  that's not as much  the one is  how much is that  that one's only a few hundred  i want to get  525  dude i threw out  all my old concert shirts  because i'm too fat for them  but i wish i was like  really small again  so i could wear these like  because they made them small  back in the 80s  they didn't have xls  they're all mediums  the ones that survived  yeah 
[01:15:00]  i wish i was smaller  the xls probably got all  stretched out  or shrunk in the warsh  and then  i want to wear old  aussie shirts  for pete's sake  oh  well you're working out now  i want to start  am i  i thought you were  no i've been writing  you said you were working out  you worked out one day  yeah one day  but i've been writing  obsessively  about what  trying to write a show  oh  is there a part for us  jimmy is constantly  revamping his act  no this is not 
[01:15:30]  it's actually for a show  no a show show  a show  that's what i heard  yes  oh  but i just  i have to pitch it  that's good  i'm gonna be like lucy  and you're ricky  i want to be in it  ah  jimmy  now anthony  no part in the show  it's about a man of intrigue  oh okay  a man of intrigue  a man of intrigue  who travels a lot  from place to place  yeah  and he has a magic ring  oh  and 
[01:16:00]  his  the bulge in his pants  is legendary  legendary  bulge  yes  in his pants  and everybody pokes it  with sticks  well  and he goes  oh that doesn't sound  very good  starring me  that's the conflict  part of the show  will he get his  will his cock bulge  get poked  will he zip it up again  by accident  will he fall onto it  because he traipses a lot  and plays hopscotch  will he fall face first  and slip on the rock  and hit his giant  cock bulge  on the curb  again  cock bulge  sounds like a good one 
[01:16:30]  yeah it's called  McGiver  it's  it's  it's like  MacGyver  but it's spelled  with two V's  McGiver  yeah  someone said  it should be called  codpiece  McGillicuddy  I kept thinking  of how nothing  is bad  with McGillicuddy  McGillicuddy  always good  always funny  it always brightens  your day  yes  McGillicuddy  Elizabeth Edwards  McGillicuddy  see  you just feel better  about the whole tragedy  I don't really care now  yeah 
[01:17:00]  someone's suggesting  I need an air horn  for my  for my truck  I know that  I've been thinking about it  you're really gonna get one  that would be fun  it would be really fun  to be able to just  blast some of these  fucking cabs  and the fucking  town cars  in the city  it's like a  a train horn  love that  god  you're just a jerk  I really am  a complete jerk  but I really like  taking it 
[01:17:30]  to the  I like being a  good jerk  I wanna be good at it  like really good  so I need the equipment  you're really good at it  am I good at it  yes  you're extremely  extremely good at it  hey we got a little  something to play  the American Pickers guys  were in  and the boys  took that interview  I do believe  yeah  mostly Derek  yes  like 99.999% Derek  did you  did he go with the gay thing  um  not necessarily  trying to figure this out  before I play it 
[01:18:00]  no not necessarily  oh my god  the gay undertones  no not really  that were happening  undertones  during the interview  overtones  wow  you think those guys are gay  couple of fruits I think  are people trying to  figure that one out  I know our staff  is trying to figure it out  I said yesterday  I was watching the show  and one guy that they  went over to the house  to do some picking  said uh  you two aren't married  are you  they're nice boys  like just employing  I don't care if they are  I'm just trying to figure it out  they just wanna find things  in your house  it was very vague 
[01:18:30]  it really was  and if they are  I wanna know if they're  being gay with each other  like what's going on  with those two  they spend like 18 hours  a day together  and they go shopping  for antiques every day  and they made it a career  what do you think  is that what you're saying  well I don't know  just take a look at things  look at patterns that repeat  it certainly is a fine show  that seems to be one  that does  American Pickers  is a fine show  I love that show  it's terrific  they're new friends  of the show  I'm wearing the hoodie  right now  but I don't even know  if the guy  when he was talking  about dancing on the bar  in front of chicks 
[01:19:00]  I don't know  if that was him  being over the top  making believe  knowing that we think  the talk in the back office  is the Kim Kardashian  talk was so over the top  that it was like  dude what are you doing  what part was that again  when he said he sniffed  the car seats  because Kim Kardashian  had been in the car  they're gay together  yeah  you're convinced  I'm convinced  it's me  total opinion  that's opinion  it's coming from  AJ Poopy Shits  yes  I see  he was doing  the AJ Poopy Shits  where it was like  oh she's hot  she's so hot 
[01:19:30]  so you're saying  that him sniffing  Kim Kardashian  is to kind of  throw us off  a little  he's a guy's guy  he's to put us  on the wrong track  and then on the show  I was watching  they were talking  about like  who would you do  and they brought up  two girls  and then it ended up  that they just  brought up two guys  yeah  and the who would you do  was two guys  and they had to pick  from that  and was the one  like has a girlfriend  for a really long time  but that was  16 years  but that was very vague  very vague  we don't know anything  about her  we don't know 
[01:20:00]  and he said  yeah he's not  he's not looking  to get married  anytime soon  because he's a man's man  look at these two ladies  I want to hang out  in a man cave  my schedule  doesn't allow for it  gotta suck cocks  all day  no time  in that van  yeah  too busy buying  SO signs  and sucking cocks  but every  ever since that show  came out  like I've been  sitting there  and every single time  because Jess  was on this bandwagon  from the time 
[01:20:30]  the show first came on  and as soon as  that show came on  she's like  these guys are gay  no I told her  and I point out  every single time  in the episode  every instance  where you believe  they were gay  100%  where they're  you got some examples  of them being gay  on the show  I think the ass fuck episode  was that gay  it didn't happen  oh that's right  literal Jim  by the way  I want to say it again  new friends of the show  and we do like them  we just have some questions  this isn't something  I haven't seen before  I'm sure  right  just here's what happens  when you go to Google  and if you have  the predictive type on 
[01:21:00]  and you type in  American Pickers  and then put a space  it'll give you  the next most searched term  yeah  so the top three  is American Pickers  Danielle  which is the girl  on the show  then you have  American Pickers  website  which is another one  and then third  is American Pickers  gay  that's third  click on that  that's third  I hit website  by accident  oops  click on that  wow  what  History Channel 
[01:21:30]  for shame  American Pickers  that's the title  I'm assuming that  this is a message board  yes it is  alright  wait  the message board  says godlike  what did the top say  oh  godlike productions  UFOs  conspiracy theorists  and lunatic fringe  alright  yeah  can't believe  History Channel  would show  such a disgrace  to our older  generation  farms  nothing about  gay stuff though  you think the  short fat one  when he was in it  do you think he  really meant to say  they were in the 
[01:22:00]  same bed together  in the same bed  and he was in his  underwear eating  Funyuns or something  oops I mean  because  we didn't have any  money and  we slept in the  same bed  I don't care how  poor I am  or what I'm doing  with anybody  right  and we're on the  road and we're  making money  I'm not sleeping  I'll sleep on the  fucking floor  you're sleeping on the  floor or in the  bathtub  do you think they  were playing ring  toss with the  Funyuns  with their mouths  every time you got  one on you had to  nibble it  of the post 
[01:22:30]  the peg  the penis  yes  I do wish  the throbbing penis  that if my theory  is correct  and this is  you know  it's just my theory  but I wish  that they would be  open with it  if my theory  is indeed the case  because  what do you find  I think so  it's on Yahoo Answers  and it says  are those guys  from American Pickers  gay  and the best answer  chosen by the asker  it says  I don't know  for sure  but they are suspect  they hugged a lot  on tonight's new episode  and they bicker 
[01:23:00]  they bicker  like a married couple  they like peck at each other  they're pecking at each other  like that  those are the  the audio examples  I would have  them like  bickering over  who should be driving  you know what too  is when they  show up  at a pick site  and then one of them  starts spending  like a little more money  than the other one  is comfortable  because then  they really do  start behaving like  I mean I know  they're in business together  but they do  it looks like a married couple  fighting over finances  well Sam seems to be on this  why don't you  fucking take a couple days 
[01:23:30]  and bring us some examples  of what you're thinking  exactly  if fruit  well there's no reason  bring some of the bickering  bring some of the other  like undertones  I will  I'm going to start  I'm going to look through  a few episodes  please do  yeah do like a little  investigative piece  uh oh wait a second  I'm finding some  some conflicting info  oh wait a minute  on cha-cha  cha-cha  are the guys  from American Pickers  gay  and the answer here  says  on the episode  White Castle  on the Farm 
[01:24:00]  the heftier host  mentioned he bought  a lamp for his girlfriend  so probably not  oh yeah yeah  my girlfriend's at home  I don't let her  on the TV show  but she's at home  you know what though  you don't know her  that's it  so he's straight  he's straight  yeah  it's not a myth anymore  you can tell  that was busted  busted  they're plausibly gay  I think the gayness  is plausible  yeah  see nobody's ever  the problem is  there's no control  on that show 
[01:24:30]  no they need a control  nobody's ever thought  the Mythbusters were gay  and they're two guys  in business together  yes everybody thought  they were gay  they're not gay  no they're not  well now you kind of  there was suspicion  there too  yeah  but now I mean  this is  well look  Pickers is only like  two seasons deep  so  it's a year in  and they've been  all over the place  365 days  hey relax  it's okay  so get us some audio  from American Pickers  please  okay  and go through  that fucking  bridoplasty show  I've been watching it 
[01:25:00]  it's more conceptually  oh  than it is  with specific  audio clips  alright if you find  a good one  I'll bring it to the show  because that show  is twisted  I try to always  here's what Dirk  did with the  American Pickers guys  on the next episode  of American Fuckers  Mike and Frank  travel the back roads  of America  looking for rusty gold  we are man  we're in the mantiques  we're making rust hot  me and Frankie  are the rock stars  of rust  they're looking for  amazing antiques  to fuck  buried in people's 
[01:25:30]  garages and barns  what happens is  you get in these  barns and stuff  and I'll f***  anything that's  transportation related  I f*** a 1913  Indian in a barn  I f*** a 1913  Harley in a barn  yeah it's hard  to really get the  get the boner on  that's hard  you know what I mean  what most people  see as junk  they try and stick  their dicks into  oil cans  gas pumps  everything  different heights  sizes  shapes  everything  four wheels  two wheels  memorabilia  beer cans  that was smoking  man  I did high five  them  I was like  dude that was awesome  we can't just be  a one trick pony 
[01:26:00]  I mean we've got  a f*** a lot of  different things  you know all of a  sudden brass blade  fans are hot  I love brass blade  fans  I want a dry hump  of brass blade fans  they're f***ing the  history of America  one piece at a time  you know nothing  surprises us anymore  I don't think  we're f***ing cool stuff  the cool thing about us  is you know we get  excited about just  about anything  you know we're just  looking for stuff  we have never f***ed  before  find out which  forgotten relics  will get fucked  yeah  woo  all on the next  episode of  American Fuckers  that's a good bid  right there  ladies and gentlemen  god damn 
[01:26:30]  that one is a good  f***ing bid  that's good  really great  my favorite part  is the fact that  Danny's saying  American Fuckers  but apparently  they can't say it  the funny part is  that we had a  conversation about that  yesterday  saying can we  should it work  without the beeps  like should everybody  be beeped or should  everybody just be  saying the word  now obviously  they you know  it would be hard  to say they didn't  say it  so does it make  sense for the  announcer  and I thought  that it kind of  sets the bid up  yeah  and I said  and I said to  Derek I'm like  who the f***'s  going to think  about that  of course Jimmy did  Jimmy  it's still very funny 
[01:27:00]  to be the first thing  that comes out  it's like of course  but it is very funny  but there's a lot  of people out there  you're not smart  enough to know  what it was about  unless you're spoon fed  yeah that's what  I figured  that's a term in this  business we use a lot  you gotta spoon feed  the audience  if you just put it  out there up front  then no one's  guessing what's  on the list  of course  you know what it is  a lot of times  the listeners  don't have the skill set  the skill set  you don't like  when I use that one  I do like that one  alright  let's take a break  I think  oh no  Mike Baker  will be here at 830 
[01:27:30]  Mike Baker  XCIA guy  oh good  and Alex Jones  we can get on the phone  if we want to talk  about WikiLeaks  oh  and we can  figure it out  in a few minutes  I guess  the Opie and Anthony  struggle  on the virus  serious  exam  you do it  to yourself  you do  and that's why  we have  you do it  to yourself  just do  you do it  to yourself 
[01:28:00]  ah hell yeah  Radiohead  the Benz  is the name  of that  fine CD  one of my  favorite CDs  of all time  by the way  if anyone  gives a shit  you probably don't  and that's fine  what's one of your  favorite CDs  of all time  Anthony  oh my god  of all time  god  I don't know  Steven Lynch  turned me on  to this  driving from LA  to Vegas  for a gig  when we were  off the air  he turned me on  to Radiohead  I just knew 
[01:28:30]  the hits  at that point  in my life  and he goes  you gotta hear  this whole  fucking album  and it's been  one of my  favorites ever  since  I gotta go  as far as  an album  goes  it's probably  the one  I've listened  to the most  and the most  songs off of it  so it would  have to be  Alice in Chains  Unplugged  thank you  that's exactly  what it is  that's one of  mine too  actually  I never heard  that whole  record  I haven't  oh my god  it's amazing  every fucking  song  is great  their Unplugged  was better  than Nirvana's  that's what I think  Nirvana's was  pretty damn good  too  what's a good  song off  Unplugged  Alice in Chains  I haven't  I just  music never 
[01:29:00]  hit me  I don't think  they stink  I just  it never  angry chair  why would they  sing a song  about E-Rock's  chair  they got  sorry  angry chair  because he  puts so much  weight on it  I think that's  what it was  I think that's  what Jimmy  was going for  there  it's very  angry  sick of all  that weight  the chair is  it's angry  can I hear a little  bit of that  I just don't  I really wish  I liked these 
[01:29:30]  guys  oh my god  nutshell  learn to like  them  yeah down in  a hall  fucking great  man  look how  pretty  the Cantrell  guitar  laying looking 
[01:30:00]  like the gypsy  brushed his  cheek and  said  thin  thin  he's not  healthy  at this  point  like when  they kick  it up  great harmonies  it just  doesn't reach  me  really  yeah but  again  when he  screams  let's go  down in  a hall  and I  don't  know  if I 
[01:30:30]  can  you  say  see my  heart  I  decorate  it  like  a  crane  that's a great  voice  shit man  oh you  don't  understand  who they  thought  I was  supposed to  be  it's just  a unique  voice too  yeah  you knew  you were  listening to  Lance  Daly  fuck in  me now  I'm a man  who won't 
[01:31:00]  let himself  be  down in  a hall  that's good  shit man  losing  my soul  yeah he did  a great  voice  gotta get  through his  little finish  there  it's great 
[01:31:30]  live too  just like  hitting all  the notes  it looks  effortless  sounds great  honestly he sings  effortlessly  he's just  sitting in his  chair  fucking singing  without straining  or anything  he was great  that's one of  those voices  man  holy shit  one of those  great  legendary  singers  of the 90's  nutshell is  the best unplugged  song  I agree  Frank in  Southampton 
[01:32:00]  don't have  time to go  to you right  now  I don't love  love  grunge style  I think that's  what it is  like I don't  that was more  harmonizing  listen to the  words man  there's a vocal  thing they do  that I just  don't love  yeah  yeah  it's  my taste  great  being at one  of these  fucking  things  majestic 
[01:32:30]  I didn't know  they did this  in Brooklyn  I told you  that  shut it  I like how  one plug  turned into  completely  plugged in  acoustic  like drums  fucking  three guitars  they took  some liberties  yeah  which is fine  it sounded  fantastic  where's Lane  how come he's  late  see that's no  good  he dramatically  walks out last 
[01:33:00]  there he is  just popped  the surgical  tubing off  his arm  he was  in really  bad shape  he did  make it look  fairly  happiness  yeah  you know people give us shit for this too because it's like 
[01:33:30]  you know we understand  it was the 90s  why don't you fucking listen to some new music  there they go guys  like I do  I just want to appreciate a man that is dead  what year was this  1850s  that's where I was wrong  I thought it was newer  I would guess  hold on  96  no  before that right  92 
[01:34:00]  that's right  wait a minute  we were in  95 to 98  so yeah it might be 95 or 96  you're right  I think this was  96  I'm normally right with unplugged guesses  you're about right  I won boy most likely to guess it unplugged it  in high school  yes it was an amazing award  April 10 96  I told you  am I the only fucking  Alice in Chains fans in this shit house  I think I watched that over fucking Ozone's house  yeah we all used to hang out at fucking Ozone's house 
[01:34:30]  yeah  watch that one  and we were just like holy fuck  and now Ozone had a sex change I guess  and he's doing  talk radio wear  that's what Scores said  and you know everything Scores says is true  that's true  I don't think Ozone wants anything  Ozone doesn't want anything to do with us unfortunately  we've kind of reached out a little bit  and like come on Ozone  call our show  come on  come on  uh Sam what do you got  we're gonna go with the American Pickers thing  hopefully a lump  oh come on  I love the age  you went with cancer  I don't think you really feel that way 
[01:35:00]  no  hope your ball has a nugget in it  no  a little gold bullion  that's terrible  and after Elizabeth Edwards  oh that's right  she's been having her balls  my mistake  yes well  luckily  I did have a couple clips on reserve  oh you did  of the American Pickers  because  I mentioned this before also  on the Saturday night show  that's on the virus here 
[01:35:30]  oh look at that  it's shameless  I didn't mention that  the show was called  special delivery  with who  Sam and Dave  oh  and technically it's starring  Sam and Dave  starring  you have to make sure the branding is correct  do you say starring  special delivery starring Sam and Dave  starring Sam and Dave  when one of the stars  has to fucking travel 18 hours  to get here for no money  is that really starring  on a bus  you're talking about Dave  you're not a star  if you make negative money  doing your creative process  it's costing you  yeah  so we  you got this  yes 
[01:36:00]  I got a few clips  this is all from one episode  yeah we're trying to figure out  if the American Pickers guys  are gay  I mean  with these clips  I believe  is evidence  in the favor of  yes they are  not only  they're a gay  they're a gay couple  are you saying  irrefutable proof  I would say so  oh wow  based on  some of it is based on  social context of the clips  not only gay  gay couple  oh yes  gay couple  I believe  alright  that the American Pickers  are gay together  today we're in Michigan 
[01:36:30]  it's close to home  we've had a lot of picks here  we've had a lot of luck  but whenever Daniel  can find us something new  up here  it's great  this is where Kid Rock's from  isn't it  Michigan  he's from Detroit  I know that's in Michigan  right  who do you think's hotter  Cam Anderson  or Robin Roberts  Pam Anderson  she's not as hot as  Diane Sawyer  that's right  two guys talking about  hot chicks  yeah  talking about news anchors  news anchors 
[01:37:00]  because that's  that's the only context  they could really  they don't know about  hot chicks  and who's talked about  Pam Anderson  in forever  hey how about that  charro huh  yeah  wow  how about  I think Pam Anderson  is the safe choice  if you don't know  anything about chicks  exactly  exactly it  if you don't know  anything about chicks  you go wow  that Pam Anderson  is really hot  how about that  Pam Anderson huh  you know she hasn't been  hot in probably  ten years  another Anderson  someone has to  fucking say that  what about Lonnie Anderson  let me tell you  she's a hottie 
[01:37:30]  that Lonnie Anderson  don't tell me  Pam Anderson is still hot  no fucking way  no  if somebody said that to you  you would either assume  that they're living  in a time warp  or that they are  homosexual  right  well what they really  wanted to say  is who do you think  is hotter  Pam Anderson  Pam Anderson  or a bunch of  cum on a mirror  that you can lap up  like a hungry puppy  who do you think  is hotter  Pam Anderson  and then they cut away  because you know  they don't want  the answer  or a kibbles  and bits bowl  of cum  that you can just  suck up with a straw 
[01:38:00]  and burp in your  friend's face  what do you think  is hotter  this is a good  John from Denver  as in John Denver  oh  hi John  go ahead  there's another show  that's very popular  where I suspect  a lot of people  think the two hosts  might be gay  oh  they have a lot of  cute young boy  interns working for them  they claim they don't  do anything  but they keep them 
[01:38:30]  around anyway  oh  well  the opium anthony show  oh  I didn't see  I didn't see that coming  oh man  that Pam Anderson  is really hot  hey guys  what are you  yeah  how about that  Judy Garland  yeah but  there's a bunch of  guys right here  we won't set  sex with them  that's right  chip  thank you  I like being called  gay  are the American  pickers  gay  I believe they are  we have another clip  with each other  Danielle's calling 
[01:39:00]  bugs in here man  what's this guy  going on here  hey Danny  what's up  hey honey  I have a lead  for you guys  that to me  is one of the most  damaging pieces  of evidence  why  it sounded like  nothing  because  tear it apart  for us  there is  no  heterosexual man  who would call up  a female  and have her  non-sexually  call him honey  it doesn't happen  oh  you know something  you're going deep  with this  she did just go  alright honey  that's what girls  call their gay friends 
[01:39:30]  gay friends  yes  honey  sister  girlfriend  holy shit  Sam  you're onto something  I don't know Sam  I might have to  take issue with that  only because  not take issue  I don't take  umbrage with it  Sam got the subtlety  I just don't know  but I don't know  women do that stuff  they call you sweetie  because they can  non-sexualize you  I think these guys  are sucking down cum  like it's fucking  like it's  like it's  like it's the  elixir of life  like it's gonna  be extinct  dude I think 
[01:40:00]  these guys  are sucking cum  like literally  they're not even  drinking cum  from each other's  dicks  I think  that they're  I don't even  think they're  I think that  they'll just  take you to  their soft cock  and suck  cum  so hard  that it's  ripped out of  the balls  with a layer  of skin  with no  orgasm  no orgasm  they literally  are going  past pleasure  and fucking  ripping the cum  out with their mouths  wow  probably  are we gonna  lose them 
[01:40:30]  as friends  I wouldn't  see why  I wouldn't  exactly consider  them friends  they stopped  in and hawked  their show  for eight minutes  and then  sashayed out of  here like  two fucking  peter pumpers  they fucking  moonwalked down  the hall  with their  cocks in their  asses  I didn't notice  the sashay  no they were  good guys  I'm just kidding  it's a big  show  it's a big show  dude I asked  if they were a  couple  I did ask  that but  I wish  if they are  a couple  they should  say it  who cares  they don't  want to lose  that middle  America base  oh fuck  middle America  and their  dopey fucking  things they 
[01:41:00]  save in their  barns  plus all the  guys in the  deep south  wouldn't let  them in their  garages anymore  that is true  what do you  want to go  through  faggot  there's no  peters in there  yeah what you  looking for  an asshole  to have  sex with  it's not even  a creative  thing to say  no it's not  they wouldn't  be  they would  just be  just nasty  and hateful  yeah  let's get  to the  wait  what are you  looking for  old butts  what  trying to figure 
[01:41:30]  out if the  American pickers  are gay  we got another  clip from  an episode  this was all  on one episode  this was all  on one episode  Danielle the  hot chick  on the show  yeah  thinks the  guys are weird  weird  you guys are  weird  hi girl  hey you know  what too  you guys  I forgot to  tell you  she has a  65 Honda  a 65 Honda  yeah  you know  I'm Mr.  Honda  alright  it sounds  even better  Danielle if  you were here  you should have  seen Frankie's  face light up  man  my day is 
[01:42:00]  complete  well I'm glad  I completed  your day  because Frankie  you complete  me  you are the  wind beneath  our wings  you guys are  totally weird  alright we're  off  bye bye  hi  Sam you're  going to  lose us  on this one  what are you  talking about  Bette Midler  reference first  of all  who's quoting  Bette Midler  I didn't even  know that was  a Bette Midler  exactly  fruity  Bette Midler  reference  and again  completely  non-sexual  you complete me  yeah  you complete 
[01:42:30]  me  the girl  said that  to Frankie  or one of  the guys  what's the  cake thing  all about  oh I thought  she said  cock  in front  of him  I thought  he said  his eyes  went off  like he had  a cock  in front  of him  it was  cake  my mistake  but the  Bette Midler  quote was  I thought  very damaging  yeah  someone said  why didn't  we ask  the guys  didn't you  hear Jimmy  just say  he asked  the guys  I said  you guys  a couple  Jesus  Jimmy did  ask  and then  they talked  about their  girlfriends 
[01:43:00]  that the  guy had  had for  16 years  they're very  vague  girlfriends  I'll give  you guys  a couple  and there  was a  guy  he was  too busy  having his  morning cock  he was  ringing  come out  of those  balls  the way  one would  would  fucking  ring a  dishrag  what's  Otto's  line on  that  like the  oxygen  sucked  by cock  like you're  drowning  and the  balls  contain  oxygen  that really  is  sucking  a cock  that's  a great  line  because you  would  really  hungrily  go for  oxygen  if you  were  drowning  Keith  in  Chicago 
[01:43:30]  the  Windy  City  checking  in  what's  up  Keith  why are  you  defending  these  guys  do you  have  something  to say  Keith  honestly  unless I  heard from  your show  I never  watched  the show  so I  can't  I'm not  defending  or denying  you  could  reference  Pam  Anderson  but I  think he  mentioned  how hot  she is  or something 
[01:44:00]  he was  not hot  anymore  he was  trying to  think of  hot chicks  in his  head  and he  thought of  Pam  Anderson  Robin  Roberts  and Diane  Sawyer  yeah he  couldn't  those guys  who's  Robin  Roberts  she's  right  when these  guys talk  about girls  it reminds  me of  guys trying  to do  the gay  voice  they just  go for  the immediate  like  like the  hack  gay  thing  like  if you're  not into  chicks  saying  Pam  Anderson  is  the  hack  thing  to say 
[01:44:30]  and it's  like if  you want  to describe  gay guys  you just  put your  hand down  and go  hi  and make  gay faces  I'm doing  my limp  wrist  that's how  that's the  hacky  like that's  that's a  non-gay  guy's impression  of a gay  guy  hey my  friend's gay  hi  I'm fruity  hi  because you  think you  know  about the  whole community  right  just going  after the  heterosexual  stereotypes  is Robin  Roberts  the  in person  I wouldn't  refer to her 
[01:45:00]  as that  but I  believe  yes  is she  your sister  no  she's not  related  same last  name  same last  name  and they  mention her  as being  hot  yes  she thought  she had  cancer  and she  had a  fucking  bald  for a while  correct  can you show  the guys  a picture  of Robin  Roberts  you would  never put  her in  the hot  category  no  I'm gonna  fuck  Scotty  Pippen  hi  I love  the limp  wrist  god  let me see  this one  why would  you say  that's hot  ever  and that's  before  she lost  all her  hair 
[01:45:30]  I think  it's back  now  right  I see  her in  a juice  joint  every once  in a while  is she  still on  TV  yeah  she is  she was  the one  that decided  to go  on TV  without her  hair  without her  wig  with no  hat  but how  would you  say  that's  hot  it's  not  I wouldn't  say  she's  hot  at all  but they  didn't  know  any  black  women  they  could  just  think  of her  because  they  watch  GMA  every  morning  while  they're  sitting  on  plungers  even though  I don't  agree  with it  wouldn't  the go  to one  be  Halle Berry  or something  she's beautiful  yeah  she's beautiful

[01:59:00]  looking at black  asses  do you have to  ruin the hard-ons  with Edward Norton  references  I know  it's a fun movie  I know  trying to get our  fucking dicks hard  in here  a bunch of men  oh you said  black by injection  I missed that  fine  yeah  yeah  bravo to that  that's what  these chicks are  alright  and the American  Pickers guys  are gay  yes we did it  we proved it  we're good  that's the name  of our bit  in theory  is Mike Baker  here  yes  yeah  oh okay good  fuck  cool  I wonder if he's  into  I say fuck 
[01:59:30]  because  I'll say it now  so it'll be the  big tease  maybe after Mike  Baker leaves  or he could join  the party  our good friend  Dr. Steve  was in a band  called  or is this the name  of the song  no I do believe  that's the band  the band's name  was Moonage Daydream  Moonage Daydream  and we got  one of his songs  from 1975  in our possession  by the way  Dr. Steve  on Vox  on Vox  he's on Vox  he's on Vox  and organ  and organ of course 
[02:00:00]  Vox and organ  I would love  to see  a fucking  like  how did we get  this  video of that  he emailed it  to me last night  he called me  he loves to be  abused I guess  he's somewhat  proud of it  he'll probably  play it down  like I had  make fun of it  but he's proud  of it on some level  I think we're  ahead of our time  well later on  in the show  we'll get to  Dr. Steve's  shitty band  Moonage Daydream  Travis had a great  idea too  because that was  recorded in 75  so we could take  a look at  the biggest albums  of 75  and just to see 
[02:00:30]  what Moonage Daydream  was up against  fuck that's a  great idea  see if he's  kind of  in with the time  let's see if  he's got his  finger on the  pulse of what's  going on back  then  I want to do  two things  who has  heard the song  I heard it  don't say anything  I heard some of it  and is there  a publicity shot  of the band  no unfortunately  because the game  I want to play  is I want to  guess what kind  of  you okay  jam get grandpa  yes  there's no care  on this show  Jimmy's basically  having a heart attack  in the corner  and we're just like  continuing the show 
[02:01:00]  chest pain  and he grabbed  my water  I have been getting  a lot of chest pain  oh no  not today  but in general  have you gone for  a stress test  no but like  a lot of times  does it get worse  when you exercise  no  does it shoot up  the jaw a little bit  or down the arm  no it's just in the chest  it's around where the heart is  and I've literally  been having it  yes  is it sharp  or dull  dull like a  it feels like a muscle pull  in the heart  does it change  if you move your arm  around  if you stretch  I think it does 
[02:01:30]  a little bit  yeah then  then it's nothing  I hope not  maybe your heart's too big  for your own good  because you're so kind  you know what  I think he might be right  yeah  I do nothing but give  what were you voted  what's that  what were you voted  the boy most likely  to give without being asked  four out of five years  wow  yes  four out of five  who won the one year  I don't know  I was  I was in a mission in Africa  giving of myself  I wasn't eligible for voting  looking for fucking  straight stunting chicks  let's see a bragging 
[02:02:00]  no really fast  I'm setting it up  I want to try to figure out  what kind of music  Dr. Steve's band did  but Moon Age Daydream  I thought that sounded familiar  lousy  I can't take credit for this  someone reminded me  that that's an old  David Bowie song  oh  so they have to be  doing a Bowie thing  they're doing like glam  they have to be  if they're named  Moon Age Daydream  I would have thought  moody blues kind of sound  but don't don't tell us  don't give us any hints  I'm just wondering  1975 was  I'm thinking kind of  moody blues-ish 
[02:02:30]  no  you're thinking more  glam  rockin glam  yeah I think  Dr. Steve glam  yeah I think so  well he had long hair  and in the 80s  he had a jerry curl  oh boy  that's true  wow  I saw it on the back  of his book cover  that he doesn't like  talking about  oops  Nick Snay  on the uk bay  some of the stories  he told me  I'm working them  eventually he'll  say them on the air  I don't want to  that guy has lived a life  he was in a big band  reflux Jimmy 
[02:03:00]  is coming in  what  what's that  acid reflux  is coming in  I do have acid reflux  if you get a bed  it will cause like  a little chest pain  in the left side there  oh I'm hoping  that's what it is  good  okay because I was  really worried  about my heart  go get the heart  checked out  I did that recently  I'm too busy  that's what guys say  right before they  drop dead  my modeling career  is taking off  I can't have it  spoiled  yes  congratulations  thank you Sam  that's great  yes  good to hear  yes  Mike Baker next  Opinand 3  the Opinand 3 
[02:03:30]  smoke  on the virus  Sirius XM  wow  this is rocking  sure is  we're rocking  yeah  hi everybody  how you doing  this windy  Wednesday  straight stunting 
[02:04:00]  yeah  there's another  issue of  straight stunting  not another issue  it's their  calendar  their calendar  I got another  issue  I brought in  two  because I brought  in three magazines  one for each  but I found  in my  stash  I found  another one  that I didn't  bring in  for you guys  and also  the 2010  straight stunting  athletic honeys  catalog  I see that  I might have  to  I just had  this one  I might have  to tweet  that's the one 
[02:04:30]  I might have  to tweet  yammy doll  oh yeah  hey Mike Baker  you like yammy doll  jeez that's what  I'm getting for  Christmas  that's crazy  are you a fan  of the black ass  you know I'm  just proud to be  following the  black ass discussion  isn't that great  that's what I've  always been hoping  for  yeah  yeah  guys  you know  well former fed  and  that one  he's got to  follow this  he understands  black ops  and black asses  right  it's the same  thing  is that the  same thing 
[02:05:00]  it sure is  yeah  what the fuck  to do with that  it's a wet job  we just got  these magazines  I'm not  attracted to  the giant  behind  I don't mind it  though  there's nothing  about the big  thing  it doesn't  do it for me  I like  proportioned girls  I gotta say  I'm in your  camp on that one  yeah  yeah  you're a racist  too  I am  I think that's  where we need  to go  with that  thank you  the race  has as much  to do with it  as the giant  ass does  but you know 
[02:05:30]  I'm just not  into that  you know  I gotta tell you  I was at a  dinner  not the name  drop  but I was at  a dinner  last night  with Michael  Hayden  you know  former head  of the CIA  and how proud  would he be  to know  that the next  day  I'm having  this conversation  it just shows  that you can  really bounce  from one subject  to another  yeah  you're a jack  of all trades  I like to think  that's what  it does  I need that  to assimilate  in the field  your ability  to improvise  exactly  one minute  you're acting  like an intelligent  guy  the next minute  you're acting  like a big 
[02:06:00]  giant ass  looking at one  let's talk  football man  you're a football  fan  Giants  you're a Giants  fan  I am  get out  alright well  goodnight  and thanks for  coming  I'm a Jets  fan  I took a beating  this week  you hear about  this player  though  I don't know  how to say  his name  Keith Fitzhugh  or something  like that  the Jets  want him  on the team  he said no  he'd rather  be a train  conductor  because it's  a more stable  job  he likes the  hats  I know  I certainly  do 
[02:06:30]  he says  because it's  a more stable  job  I think I heard  about this  coming in  he said  it was more  stable in this  economy  and he wants  to have health  insurance for his  parents  but can't  the company  he works for  go  we'll keep  your job  for you  go play a little  football and you  come back and  see us  is this guy  coming out of  college already  I'm not really  sure  I guess he's  just a free  agent  I guess he's  played in the  league before  I think I just  looked at him  in straight  stunting magazine  put a wig on  him  she was just  in that Lakers  uniform  yammy doll 
[02:07:00]  yammy doll  but the health  care is good  yeah the health  care  Mike is now  perusing  straight stunting  magazine  he's just  looking through  it like he  would look at  a dossier  someone's dossier  he's looking for  Colonel Kurtz  it's got the  little subscription  on the bottom  that says  Jim Norton  can I read  out your  home address  sure  because Anthony  is asking  yammy doll's  measurements  I was asking 
[02:07:30]  how about you  guess  alright  let me see  you'll get the  first one right  the first one  has to be  is it in the  30s  sure  38  alright  36  36  then she  goes  27  get out  of here  they're  lying  she goes  62  45  45  45  she's too  fat for me  45  look at that  it looks bigger  that's actually  not bad  but it looks like  implants  not bad  that's terrible  you could land a 
[02:08:00]  predator drone  on that ass  he knows it  he's trying  that's what he  calls his cock  thank god  it's still  armed  hey  did you hear  about this  wiki leaks  thing  do you got a  minute to tell  me about it  maybe we're  breaking the  news to him  you're a  giants fan  there you go  take a look  at 7  from the  calendar  it's number  7 
[02:08:30]  no that's  good  that's  good  better look  at that  than  Justin  Tuck's  ass  big fat  asses  that's it  it's terrible  so yeah  I have heard  about this  hey  yeah  somebody called  me and told  me about it  yeah somebody  told me about it  why is it a  big deal  because  what were you  saying yesterday  Jimmy  I have mixed  feelings about it  a part of me  likes what he's  doing and a part  of me  here's the things  I don't like  people say he  released stuff like  the commie  pinko party 
[02:09:00]  likes it  no no no  locations of  sensitive information  in the US  I don't like  names of  operatives  overseas  I don't  like that  I don't  like those  guys being  put in  danger  or anything  that would  endanger  troops  like whatever  that's  but there are  things he's  releasing like  Saudi Arabia  wanted us to  attack Iran  and I am so  tired of this  relationship with  that country  that I want all  that dirt  like anything  with Britain  and Libya  anything that  went on there  with that  sickening thing  where they  traded that 
[02:09:30]  that fucking  murderer  for whatever  they gave him  home relief  like that type  of stuff  I want to  come out  so you  wouldn't be  conflicted  if Assange  had come to  you first  and kind of  cleared what  should be  released  you know  what that's  but I mean  there's certain  things that  don't like  there's certain  things that I  think could  endanger people  that I don't  like  and there's  certain things  that where  it really is  fighting secrecy  I think a lot  of people feel  the same way  a lot of people  look at it  and ask that  question  why is it a  big deal  first and  foremost it's a  Manning  you know  is guilty 
[02:10:00]  of espionage  now what  he's done  is he's  passed these  on  Assange  himself  I mean  he's a  douchebag  but he's  doing exactly  what you  would expect  a douchebag  to do  he's an  anarchist  right  so he's  releasing  all this  crap  I mean  so you  can't be  surprised  by his  actions  or by  his  supporters  actions  and it's  just  that  the biggest  problem  when you  look at  what's  going on  with  WikiLeaks  is it  erodes  our ability  overseas  to have  candid  sources  and contacts  because  every time 
[02:10:30]  this happens  you lose  whether you're  talking about  a CIA guy  or you're  talking about  a State  Department  official  you lose  the ability  to have  a conversation  with a  potential source  of important  information  because  there's no  way you're  going to  keep this  secret  you can't  keep your  yaps  and they're  not going  to be  as  forthcoming  if they  find out  that behind  his back  you turn  around  and start  bad-mouthing  him to  somebody  else  even if  the information  doesn't seem  sensitive  you're ruining  a relationship  there  but that's  the stuff  that office  politics  shit  Hillary  said some 
[02:11:00]  stuff about  the King  of Jordan  who cares  I'm a big  believer in  the US  should fucking  avoid everybody  and if somebody  bothers our  interests  we should drop  so many  weapons that  we're embarrassed  in six months  I'm a believer  in pulling our  troops out of  fucking Korea  I'm sick and  tired of protecting  the ungrateful  South Koreans  I don't give a shit  if Kim Jong-il  walks in  and takes the  whole country  back  I don't care  that's what I'm  saying  so I'm tired  of this whole thing  there's a lot  of crap  in the 
[02:11:30]  a quarter  of a million  documents  so a lot  of it's just  going to be  real pedestrian  and atmospherics  and bullshit  but inside  all of that  just with the  State Department  let alone  the documents  they released  from the  Pentagon  in that  Pentagon  batch of  documents  you literally  could go  through  and identify  sources on  the ground  in Afghanistan  and Iraq  that we were  working with  and those  people  if they're  not dead  yet  once they're  identified  that they  will be  but in  this group  of State  Department  documents  it's just  atmospherics  and crap  about this  is what I  really think  but there 
[02:12:00]  are a lot  of details  in there  that shouldn't  be made  public  and again  I go back  to the same  thing  which is that  if I've got  a source  who works  overseas  in some  hostile place  and he's in  the Ministry  of Interior  or whatever  and I've  spent a year  and a half  kind of schmoozing  this guy up  to the point  where he's now  going to start  talking to me  about what their  actual plans  and intentions  are  because  we need  that insight  if we're  not going  to do  something stupid  in our  foreign policy  well now  that becomes  a much more  difficult job  every time  this crap  happens 
[02:12:30]  every time  this shit  gets released  but what about  this is what  bothers me  about the way  they're attacking  Assange  is the media  I mean  one guy  called up  yesterday  he goes  well the media  clears a lot  of the stuff  you don't know  that they do  but they do  clear  but those  fucking  vultures  like  a lot of  them are  releasing  and just  imprinting  what he put  out  it's like  it's almost  like what's  the difference  between him  and the media  and it's like  well they  clear  they targeted  two reporters  Woodward and  the other guy  targeted 
[02:13:00]  Nixon  and they  in effect  brought down  a president  so where  all of a sudden  this integrity  with what you  should release  and not release  by the media  when they  targeted  and ruined  a presidency  maybe people  say he ruined  it himself  but  you're not  saying the  media is  self-serving  I know  you're not  going there  you know  what I'm saying  but you're  right  and that's  part of the  argument  everybody's  getting there  and the right  certainly isn't  doing any  favors  because some  of that  bullshit  about  we've got  to execute  him 
[02:13:30]  we've got  to go  after him  for espionage  and talking  about Assange  you know what  again I go  back to it  look at the  source of all  his documents  this private  who's now  sitting in the  brig and  who's got  some serious  bad things  coming to  his way  but Assange  received those  now if Assange  actually helped  him  if he  somehow  provided him  with technology  to help him  access those  documents  to download  them  to pass  them  then he  might be  culpable  they might  be able to  go after him  but you're right  Assange and the New York Times  they're just a conduit  for this crap  once it gets out  in the system 
[02:14:00]  and you know  there's very little  in reality  that you can do  they're talking about  and Holder  for some reason  is trying to put  his big boy  pants on  and act tough  but he's talking  about we go  after him  for espionage  well that  ain't gonna happen  he's not an American  citizen  and you're just  not gonna get him  for espionage  or stuff like that  what about  these charges  that came up  though  that they hold  him on  now  you've been  on the inside  is this  kind of a thing  like alright  well you did this  now we do this  right  right 
[02:14:30]  well obviously  Assange says it is  he says that  you're talking about  the sex charges  the rape charges  and molestation charges  in Sweden  involving two  WikiLeaks volunteers  these girls  that were there  and he traveled  to Sweden  and he's up  on charges  apparently for  rape and molestation  with one of them  and molestation  and non-consensual  sex with the other one  and it's insane  in a way  because  they're arguing  these fine points  apparently they have  a very low bar 
[02:15:00]  for rape charges  molestation charges  in Sweden  stay out of there  don't go anywhere  near Sweden  that's what the  viewer's takeaway is  bunch of sticks  in the mud  but they  you know  they're talking about  part of the problem  is  maybe he had sex  with one of them  when the girl  was sleeping  and maybe one of them  he didn't wear a condom  and then you think  the guy's an anarchist  why would an anarchist  wear a condom  first of all  so how is that  going to stick  totally goes against  anarchy  yeah I don't know  where I'm going  with this whole thing  but I don't think 
[02:15:30]  this is going to happen  because what they've got  is they've arrested  him in Britain  no bail  no bail  but now here's the  great thing about Europe  he has the right  to appeal  to what they call  the European Court  of Human Rights  oh wow  that sounds like  something that you  can really appeal to  imagine where this  is going to go  there is no chance  in hell  and I'll bet  a month's salary  on this  that he's going  to get extradited  or that he's going  to actually be brought  up on these charges  but the thing is  again I can see 
[02:16:00]  he's a child murderer  but a guy that is  accused of two  sexual things  really would they  arrest him in Britain  and hold him  without bail  would really  that happen  would that really  happen in most cases  no  well he's a flight risk  and that's a legitimate  thing  they've not posted  the bail  but you're right  it's a very easy  lift for Assange  and his lawyers  to talk about  how this is  politically motivated  the Swiss authorities  are saying it's not  politically motivated  and quite frankly  the guy's such a douchebag  I'm sure  the charges are 
[02:16:30]  probably accurate  but he's got  a very easy time  right now  of defending himself  the timing is  what is really  something here  and it's so public  it's so out in the open  that it does make  people look and go  like wow  you know  if you cross the government  like that  they're going to find  something to throw you  in jail  do you think about  80% of the listeners  right now  wish you'd go back  to talking about  black asses  no  this is the biggest  story in the world  probably  not 80%  would you wear a condom  if you were having  sex with Yammy Doll 
[02:17:00]  Yammy Doll's disgusting  yeah  yeah  Yammy Doll  where is a condom  you know what  I think you always  got to worry about  protected sex  whether it's Yammy Doll  or anyone  yeah  you got to be  you got to be  responsible  she's wearing a  little Lakers outfit  that's not a little  Lakers outfit  she's got two  basketballs in her butt  wearing a condom  implies that you're  actually having sex  with that person  so  you wouldn't  have sex with  you  now  why  why does  your sex  have to be perfect  I do not find  that  why can't be  a little messy  and sloppy 
[02:17:30]  in the least  honestly  you like sloppy  shit right  Mike  she looks  from here  and mind you  I think it's  important to note  that this is  this is about  you know  you're holding it  about 15 feet away  but she looks  a little like  Kobe  she really does  yeah  Kobe with the  Raga  what do you think  to single-handedly  save the United  States of America  would you  as a patriot  you know  if you're talking  about the ticking  time bomb situation  the ticking  Yammy situation  yeah  I mean if this  were like  an episode of 24  yeah you'd have to 
[02:18:00]  you'd have to  pull the trigger  throw yourself  on top of the grenade  exactly  and I'd see  no way around it  but you'd just  disappear into that  you're a great American  yeah  you'd never come out  it'd be like  spelunking  why did the private  do it  why would he do it  he knows he's  going to get caught  right  because he's an asshole  but he had to know  or did he think  he was going to get  away with this  no you know  everybody who does  something  you could argue  everybody who does  something stupid  like this  thinks they're too  smart to get caught  right  I mean you see  that all the time  what was his motive  that's a great question  and how did he get caught  yeah money  he got caught  I mean there's  firewalls set up 
[02:18:30]  and there's breaks  supposedly on the system  that are supposed  to point out  the fact that  you've downloaded  700,000 documents  I mean somebody  should notice somewhere  but in terms of  why did he do it  I'd be speculating  I think he was  coerced  not coerced  that's the wrong word  he was influenced  I think to some degree  by some associates  around him  possibly by  WikiLeaks people  I think he  perhaps he was  a conscientious objector  although just  have the balls  to quit  at that point  figure a way 
[02:19:00]  to get out  of the military  because we're not  really hearing  much about him  like we're hearing  a lot about  WikiLeaks  and whatever  his name is  what is it  Assange  Assange  we're hearing  a lot about him  and WikiLeaks  but we're not  really hearing  about this  private that much  I think he's  being questioned  that's going to be  a problem  now his defense  will be that  he was tortured  while he was  in the brig  it's all going  to come back  around  no you're right  the story  became very quickly  two things  it became this  issue of transparency  as if somehow  it was okay 
[02:19:30]  for all this crap  to be out there  anyway  and it became  sort of the  salacious comments  that you know  what it's like  it's like  remember those  ten Russian spies  that got picked up  everybody went crazy  for about 30 minutes  and then the whole  conversation was about  how hot Anna Chapman is  and we completely  lost sight of the fact  that you know  okay these guys  were not  none of them  were Lex Luthor  none of them  individually  were going to  turn the world around  but the Russians  clearly have  the interest  the resource  the time  and the motivation 
[02:20:00]  to be operating  networks like that  it's not the only one  here in the states  I can guarantee that  and we lost sight  of the fact  that if they're willing  to run these  you know  schmucks out there  just to spot people  their job wasn't  to do anything  other than just  spot somebody of interest  pass them off  to one of the serious  folks that are actually  doing the spy work  yeah  but we lost sight  of that  and it's kind of like  this with the WikiLeaks  you lose sight  of what's really important  because hey  the story's kind of  entertaining in its own way  not as entertaining  as a Yammy doll  no no  of course not  it's got that  intrigue thing 
[02:20:30]  and it's got  it doesn't seem to have  though the real  money shot  of memos  the one that like  says something real  it seems like  it's kind of  catty stuff  that's going on  between  embassy people  and what not  yeah I mean  a lot of that  just like you know  Jim was talking about  is you're reading  and they go  so what  who cares  you know  let the stuff out there  but the bigger picture  is that it is  kind of an  it kind of opens up  our security 
[02:21:00]  and how we work  with diplomats  and people around the world  around the world  yeah  you know  it kind of  it opens up your hand  a little bit  well you get desensitized  to it  and that's what happens  everybody gets desensitized  to the fact that  you know  some more secrets are out  so what  yeah move on  who cares  well it's  you know  the world isn't a benign place  right  there's a lot of bad things  that go on  and there are a lot of bad people  trying to do horrible things  and you need an element  of secrecy  if we operated  in a completely transparent world  we would be completely fucked 
[02:21:30]  that's exactly what I was saying yesterday  I was talking about  Iran-Contra  and just covert operations  they're called covert  for a reason  and they're supposed to be covert  it's supposed to be going on  behind the scenes  and it's for the best interest  for the most part  of the country  in one way or another  and some people  sometimes  even Congress  aren't supposed to know  about these things  could you imagine  Congress  and the red tape  of having to go through  all this horse shit  and legalities  and stuff  you gotta sometimes 
[02:22:00]  you know  you worked in that environment  you gotta sometimes  cut some corners  yeah  and you know what  there's also  there's a good shit  well and with that  but no you're right  I mean there's  there's an understood game  that goes on too  to some degree  yes  where  okay we're gonna task you  you're gonna go out there  and do this  whatever the operation may be  if anything really goes wrong  we don't know anything  you're on your own  yeah you're on your own  and by the way  we're gonna probably have  a committee  you know formed  to crawl up your tailpipe  and say you know  how you screwed up  and realize how you were  the bad guy 
[02:22:30]  yeah  everything flows down  to any knowledge  of your actions  good luck  it's  this is what bothers me  about it  this is why  this is why  again  I've said the things  that I don't want coming out  like that's where it annoys me  but I'm tired  of the US  and our phony politeness  can we stop being polite  to the rest of the shit planet  apparently we can't  and stop  like the fact that Guantanamo  like offering millions of dollars  to a country  to take a few prisoners  all that money  could be preventing 
[02:23:00]  our taxes from being raised  and we're giving it  to some fucking dump of a nation  to please take a few prisoners  or hey  Obama will meet  if you take one of these guys  like fucking stop it  that's a funny one  stop trying to be  the world's policeman  and be nice  it's like just  we'll give you Obama  and a meeting with Bob Gates  if you take two of them  but you know what I'm saying  that's the shit I'm tired of  and if Saudi Arabia  wanted us to hit Iran  and if Saudi Arabia  is not  is refusing  to 
[02:23:30]  dismantle  these charities  that are fine  why  why are they doing that  it should be public  it should be public  if they're giving cash  to Al-Qaeda  they stink  yeah  and I think  again  that's why  this thing is such a problem  because a lot of people think  well screw it  some of this information  shouldn't be classified  and that's true  crap gets over classified  and if we were smarter about it  then we probably could resolve  some of this  because then you'd be serious  about what actually is  top secret 
[02:24:00]  and you'd firewall it off  and you wouldn't have access  to it by some  dirtbag  who's a private  in the army  and has a problem  with the military  not in the same category  as the water coolers  empty on floor 3  can we get somebody  up there to fill it  I talked to the custodian  who told me in private  and it's in the same category  as like top secret  how high of a level  did this classification  this guy have  like maybe there are  still like NSA documents  and stuff that he could  never get his hands on  there are  I mean that's true  and there's shit  that he wouldn't have seen 
[02:24:30]  but  and part of this is  the way that we always react  9-11 happened  so all of a sudden  oh my god  what do we gotta do  we gotta form the DNI  we gotta make DHS  we gotta create  all these bureaucracies  and a big part of  after 9-11 was  nobody's sharing information  so now what we saw  with the fact that  Manning was able  to access hundreds  and hundreds of thousands  of documents  all over the place  was a result of  this reaction  saying oh my god  we've gotta be able  to have a free  access to information  between all the agencies  well now guess what 
[02:25:00]  because of what he's done  the Pentagon and others  are looking and going  I don't want them  to see my shit  yeah yeah  this wasn't our problem  you guys  we gave you the information  and it slipped out  on your end  so we're not gonna  give it to you anymore  so I suspect we'll go back  to some halfway point  where it's not  a free flow  but you still gotta  I gotta get information  across to the Pentagon  to take action  right  or they've gotta get it  across to our guys  to take action  and so you've gotta  have some of this  otherwise  you got nothing  but we went way too far 
[02:25:30]  as we typically do  but it's also  can't they just put  a better firewall  or have a better  I mean there's just  one more  what's the word  one more stop  or one more checkpoint  that you can't get through  because again  considering how many  documents are available  this is the first time  that this has happened  publicly right  like it doesn't happen  that often  you know  here's a happy thought  it happens more often  than you would think  yeah  I mean people have access  but you know  in an intel environment  yeah normally you do  have a lot of checks 
[02:26:00]  and stops and breaks  and you constantly  have multiple layers  of access  and you know  unfortunately though  this guy was you know  in sort of ground zero  where all this shit  was collating  and he had the opportunity  but you know  again like you said  we've lost sight  of the fact  that what he did  was incredibly wrong  and it got passed  and now it's out there  in the open  yeah  but we're spending  all our time  you know  certainly on the  Republican side  they're spending  all their time  screaming about Assange  and again  it's serving to  desensitize us  to the real problems 
[02:26:30]  right  oh by the way  the Republicans  wanted  who did they want  who was named  Valerie Plame  Valerie Plame  yeah who was that  was that Scooter Libby  or was that one of those guys  were they calling  for his execution  right  for uh  I don't remember them  calling for his execution  or him being treated  as a traitor  it's actually interesting  because I mean  that  not to completely  drift away  from the big black asses  but I think  what we had  was with  Valerie Plame  was interesting  because the  the Dems  were  you know  they were kind of 
[02:27:00]  up in arms  about the whole thing  everybody was a little bit  set back by that  right  I mean  you know  she was  she was outed  although you could argue  that she's married  to a US ambassador  you know  it was really no secret  where she worked  because you know  he's a public figure  and a fairly  outspoken one  but now what you've got  is you've got the Republicans  up in arms about this  and the Dems  kind of defending  the WikiLeaks thing  not defending it so much  as just not showing  the same level of outrage  you know  but then again  you know  fuck the outrage  I mean  everybody's standing around  saying where's the outrage  and you think well  after a while 
[02:27:30]  I'm too tired  to be outraged  enough to be outraged  about it  hunt him down  in trees  it's just such  idiotic  that's where the  conservatives are  really annoying me  it's like  I don't want to hear it  because you didn't  go after the  to me the one  who outed  Plame  was worse  because they were  an American diplomat  who did that  they're American citizens  yeah  it was Bob Novak  in one of his columns  wasn't that an accident  though  didn't somebody  mention her first  or he felt justified  in doing it  he felt justified  in doing it  funny nobody called 
[02:28:00]  for him a treason  well exactly  who knows  maybe because he's part  of the media  and that's just  kind of what's expected  with freedom of the press  it kind of  you get into that  weird area  of is this treasonous  is it sensitive  information that  they're letting out  or is it just  the freedom of the press  when they get the  information to put it  out there to the people  and in this situation  with the advent  of the internet  it's just now  instantaneous  like this guy  what channels  would he have  had to go through  to get these documents  so widely distributed 
[02:28:30]  even a few years ago  I mean even a few years ago  just to get all this  information  you would have had it  you would have to recruit  hundreds and hundreds  and hundreds of sources  to provide bits of information  over here about Somalia  over here about China  over here about India  whatever it was  so yeah  God bless the internet  I hate the thing  I absolutely  I've got kids  so no wonder  I hate the internet  but I think that it's  I don't know  they're talking about  criminal charges  now against Assange  and again 
[02:29:00]  I don't think  honestly  at the end of the day  we're not going to  see anything done  what type of espionage  is going on  with somebody  that isn't just  a dopey private  giving it to a dopey website  you know  what governments  are really looking  into what we're doing  more sensitive stuff  on the internet  and just  culling from  databases  all over our country  like that really  that makes you start thinking  if this idiot  could do it  there are people  that are probably  a lot better trained  and 
[02:29:30]  they can suck up  some of this  sensitive information  well I think one of the  takeaways for that  is  if people take the time  to read all these documents  here I am outraged  about to release the documents  and now I'm saying  well go read the documents  take a look at this  but the Chinese  not just the Chinese  I mean  honestly again  it's the same thing  people like to think  that we're operating  in some friendly world  every other country  acts according to  its own best interests  the Chinese are trying  to constantly screw us  and steal our crap  of course  and what they're doing  is incredibly sophisticated  the Russians are the same way 
[02:30:00]  I mean  all the way to the French  and everybody else  and sometimes we  you know  I tell you what  having worked in the public  and the private sectors now  and looking at how  the U.S. companies  try to protect themselves  it's not particularly  encouraging  because we still have  this mindset  that it's not done  that you know  if we operate  on a level playing field  everything will be fine  yeah  and we tend to think  that their technology  is a lot more archaic  than it is  and oh well  the Chinese 
[02:30:30]  what do they got  you know  a few bottle rockets  and things  ah what are they  going to do  and meanwhile  they're very sophisticated  as far as ripping off  our intelligence  and what not  speaking of China  what do you think  about the Korean situation  north and south  do you see that  blowing up  quite literally  and what about China  because years ago  obviously  China was a lot more  communist  than it is now  they've kind of  settled into this  capitalist communist thing  they love money  they love business  they love selling things  they love being part 
[02:31:00]  of that world  economy  do you think  they would support  a north Korea  against  a south Korea  as far as  another  you know  kind of war  goes on  between the two  well they wouldn't want to  but I think they'd feel  like they have to  they'd be obligated  I think in a sense  as an ally  because they really  come off  I mean North Korea  completely just comes off  as a spoiled little  child of the world  making a ruckus  every time they need  to take some money 
[02:31:30]  out of the ATM  that is the United States  but I don't know  if China would be  as gung ho  to jump in there  to defend communism  and North Korea  knowing that  they're a pariah  on the world now  well I don't think  they care about that  the Chinese  A. they don't like change  right  I mean so  on the surface  you look and you think  it's a little bit like Russia  oh you know  it's transparent  well Putin's the same  as Putin's ever been 
[02:32:00]  and Putin is a long line  of communist  authoritarian people  but you look at China  and China's never going to change  as long as they can help it  right  so the Chinese authorities  they're communists  down to the very core  and they have no interest  in seeing a change  on the peninsula  what they really want  is the status quo  now they understand  they've got to rein in  the North Koreans  because they don't want a war  just like we don't want a war  but they don't want it  for various reasons  they don't want millions  and millions of North Koreans  streaming across the border  as refugees into China  I mean that idea 
[02:32:30]  scares the crap out of them  and they have no interest  in seeing a unified Korea  because of the belief  that it would  well because it would  be friendly towards us  but wouldn't it  economically be  kind of  better for them  to trade  with a unified  and democratic  and productive country  as a single Korea  then  I mean what are they doing  with North Korea  I can't see them trading  with them  they're not making any money  selling goods  they're broke  you've never been  a Chinese authority  have you  no 
[02:33:00]  you're not thinking  like a Chinese official  you've got to think  more like the Chinese  that's not what they want  they don't  again  they hate change  they hate the uncertainty  of not knowing  and a unified Korea  means they don't know  what would happen  what they really need  is for things to stay the same  what they need to do  is from their perspective  they're going to rein in  this happens on a regular  cyclical basis  every time there's a succession  in authority there  in North Korea  involving Kim's family  and so he's passing it off  to his son now 
[02:33:30]  because he's about dead  his dad  Kim Jong-il  Kim Jong-il  Kim Jong-il  Kim Jong-il  Kim Jong-il  Kim Jong-il  you know  same thing  they rattled the cage a bit  when that happened  every time they feel ignored  or they need some concessions  they'll rattle the cage  so this always  follows a certain pattern  and what happens  we act outraged  and then we give in  and then we give them  some concessions  and then things go back  to normal  they shut up for a while  and then it goes back  to them  why are we on the DMZ  why are we  we have 14,000 troops there 
[02:34:00]  why are we wasting  that money  why do we have troops  in Germany  like for what  I really  I don't want  I don't care  what these countries  do to each other  I could care less  it's like all those troops  all that money being wasted  could be  taking care of stuff here  so we bellyache  like little children  that we don't have money  and we're wasting  and protecting the South Koreans  fuck the South Koreans  you know what they're there for  it's a good question  because if things really went south  and you know  a war started  believe me 
[02:34:30]  those guys would be  they'd be vaporized  overrun in a second  so they're there  as an insurance policy  to convince the North Koreans  or the Chinese  not to do anything  and so what they've done  is they've figured out  that the smallest number  of troops they can have  that will still be  what they think to be  insurance  against the Chinese  doing something  or the North Koreans  doing something stupid  they're literally expendable  but it's that insurance policy  that like  wow we'd have to kill  14,000 Americans  and that would kind of  infuriate the world 
[02:35:00]  and it keeps them  right  it keeps them at bay  if we pulled out  they don't care  how many Koreans they kill  so what I'm saying  is why  why did we do that  that's the  that's the policing  I'm tired of allies  Saudi Arabia  I don't want any allies  no but I mean  I'm tired of allies  hey we do enough  for these motherfuckers  look what Europe did  after the Soviet Union fell  ungrateful  they can't stand us  I'm happy they're broke  I really do  I hope the whole  fucking part of the world  they have to beg forever  I can't  there's no gratitude  for the US 
[02:35:30]  they hate us  that's absolutely true  people talk about this  and I think that's  that's something  that the left  has looked at  over the past couple of years  and thought  well how come  they don't like us now  you know because  Obama's been on this campaign  for a couple of years  of turning back  the Bush years  you know  and making us  more acceptable overseas  they  it just doesn't matter  right  we can go  we can give every major leader  around the world  a blow job  and they won't care  they're not going to like us  Obama was trying that  when he first got elected  Jesus  isn't that hysterical too 
[02:36:00]  that his whole  platform of change  and believe me  I couldn't be happier  that this is happening  but his whole platform  of change  and really getting on  the Bush administration  and what they had done  over eight years  and the Bush tax cuts  being extended  there's still  prisoners in Guantanamo  there's still  two front war  going on  and the guy  is absolutely  George W. Bush  no it's  so you look at 
[02:36:30]  you look at  and that's the part  that probably more than anything  drives people crazy  on the left  is the fact that  when they look at  all the counter-terrorism measures  put in place by Bush  and Cheney  over the past few years  the vast majority  of those measures  are still in place  and some of them  have been  kind of  pushed even more aggressively  under Obama  and it's driving  the left nuts  but it's an indication  of  Obama walked in there  thinking he was going  to close Guantanamo  and then he gets  the actual brief  and he has a chance 
[02:37:00]  to sit in a big chair  for a day  that's true  he realizes  he can't make  the changes he wants  the system is  what it is  it's very tough  to make major  fucking changes  as a president  when you run  and are elected  on that platform  you just mentioned  yeah  when you run  and you're elected  on that platform  though  you are going to  piss off a lot of people  when you don't do that  like I said  I couldn't be happier  that he didn't do that  but you think  going into it  he didn't realize  how hard it would be  exactly  I think he was  pandering to some degree  too  he knew what they wanted 
[02:37:30]  to hear  he's a great politician  and politicians  love campaigning  and winning  but then doing the job  I think a lot of  politicians get kind of like  uh oh  now I gotta do this  I was a great campaigner  I didn't realize  how hard it actually is  and now the job itself  is like  wait a minute  I was watching  that press conference  yesterday  he looked like  an angry fucking man  yeah  he was a frustrated  angry man  he's a fan-skinned individual  too  you should have saw  the press conference  yesterday  he was taking his shots  knowing that he's  going to get beat up  with what went on 
[02:38:00]  was it Reed  that came out  and somebody said  it looked like  Reed's dog had been shot  that's such a great line  like he did  they are just beside  themselves  saying that the president  caved  he was not happy  yesterday  like I said though  couldn't be happier  I mean I think  extending the Bush tax cuts  is good for  to re-stimulate the economy  I think it's good for  small and big business  that are going to be  doing the hiring  and producing  for the country  and I think  cutting it off 
[02:38:30]  at $200,000  $250,000  isn't realistic  it makes no sense  I mean it makes no sense  I'll tell you something  I run a small business  smallish size business  and true story  four weeks ago  we got a call  in our little  HR department  from our health provider  and we provide  our employees  with a very good  health package  and they call up  just out of the blue  and stuff  yeah you know  sucking chest wounds  fucking tough guys  god I love it  they call up and say  we're raising your rates  30% 
[02:39:00]  as of the new year  30%  30%  straight across the board  didn't matter  single family coverage  can I talk to someone  about that  no  well that's what they said  excuse me  is there something  we can do  to maybe negotiate  no  so we've had to go  through the process  of changing coverage  with another provider  just to find something  that's going to work  the rates weren't  high enough  to begin with  I'm sure you were  getting a break  anyway  I don't know  how they get away  with that  unbelievable  do you  you said the big chair  you said something important  I think  Obama got to sit 
[02:39:30]  in the big chair  and I've always felt  like we always have  this illusion  as guys not in the know  that there is  when you get the gig  then they tell you  like you don't know  this stuff campaigning  here's what really happens  I guess that happens  once you get elected  or when you're president elect  and then you realize  what you can change  because Obama would have  pulled out troops  and he made them wait  and who was the general  that was fired for the  Rolling Stone article  oh McChrystal  McChrystal  he was angry  about waiting  for 30,000 more  because I think  Obama knew  that that was  a tremendous  no-no 
[02:40:00]  for his constituency  or whatever  but is that  what happens  when these guys  get elected  that all of a sudden  they realize  idealistically  I would like to change this  but it's just  not a realistic thing  to do  right  once you're  the president elect  and they start  giving you  the file marks  real information  but who are those  people that  sit you down  Bill Burr  has a great bit  where he says  they take you  through the basement  of the White House  and show you  where all the bodies  are buried  and what really  happened with Kennedy  and all that shit 
[02:40:30]  they scare you  the Kennedy assassination  from five camera angles  that's Bill Hicks  right  yeah  it was just  Kennedy's brain  in a jar  I thought Burr  had something on that  Billy's got something  on that  yeah  I confused it too  that was great  two great  different angles  two great comics  one dead  one alive  yeah  who actually  gives the  little speech  to the president  coming in  there's a  there's a guy  named Chuck  he's been there  for  he's the guy  with the big thing  of keys  on his belt  he's a drunk  in a blabber mouth  fucking Baker 
[02:41:00]  obviously joking  but those guys  usually know  way more  about a company  than the guys  you think should know  at the CIA  you know  you want to  find out something  you go to the  old ladies  wearing the  comfortable shoes  who have been there  for 35 years  walking up and down  those hallways  listening  collecting files  and taking pieces  of paper down  to the file room  we actually do  we just got one  file room  with a key on it  that's access  to information  the file room  on the door  you got an old lady  there  I come down  to get the  Schwartzman file  did you guys 
[02:41:30]  have fun  at the CIA  ever  yeah  we had a great time  I bet it's a blast  is it a loose  working environment  not so much  in headquarters  but I spent  almost all my time  over 17 years  overseas  yeah  killing people  and that's the way  that's the way  you do it  I'd love to know  who you killed  let's be honest  with each other  you're a bad man  if I get a copy  of Straight Stunton  magazine  that's what I would be  as an interrogation  subject  you know  I'm not talking  I'm not talking 
[02:42:00]  well here's  Straight Stunton  okay  what do you need  to know  well  here's the info  wait a minute  look at it  no wonder she's got  such a big ass  she's got chocolate  syrup and whipped cream  all over her  he's willing to  talk about the  big black asses  now  she can't even  get it in her mouth  what do you think  is in the encrypted  files  the terabyte  that they have  people have  downloaded  256 bit encryption  oh that poison  pill thing  yeah  people have downloaded  I imagine  there's a few things  in that  that are unpleasant  yeah  again  you have to 
[02:42:30]  imagine  that what they've  done  is they went  through quickly  all the documents  and the sexiest  stuff they pulled  and said  oh look at that  and they're probably  either thinking  they can monetize it  or what they're  talking about right  now which is  hold it  in case they need  some leverage  in terms of  litigation  how long would it  take to read  all those documents  how many years  I could probably  do in a couple  of days  I think  I'm very clever  when something  like that comes out  how do they  get all the  knowledge out of  it  you know what I  mean  who goes through  it  obviously  if you've 
[02:43:00]  got paper  copy  good luck  but electronic  copies  you can start  doing some  keyword  and keyphrase  searches  so then you  break it  down into areas  I knew there  had to be a system  because every once  in a while  something like this  comes out  where it's so much  info  it would be  impossible  to go through  it immediately  but they have  a way to  understanding  kind of what's  in there  and you'll look  through  you'll split it  off according  to classification  you know  this stuff's secret  this stuff's  no foreign  meaning you can't  release it to  foreigners  and you take  that stuff  and you say  oh I'm going  to go through  that first 
[02:43:30]  I thought you  got everyone  in a room  and said  okay you read  the first 852  pages  and give me a report  tomorrow  I want a book  report on this  what do you think  oh were you going  to start something  no I just wanted  to say  oh when they  oh does it in  any way  exonerate the  US too  because it's like  I joked the other  day about when  this stuff came up  like you know  where's all the  fucking 9-11  conspiracy stuff  that these morons  have been belly  aching about  believe me  Assange would  release it  he would not  sit on that  but you know 
[02:44:00]  aside from  addressing those  asshats  how about  does it in a way  exonerate the US  on any level  like this is as  bad as it gets  it's not that bad  like other  countries are shit  too and now  Fox was reporting  that  it's not talking  about torture  and shit like  that  that would have  really been like  wow  yeah  it just came back  from a good  waterboarding session  yeah  and now I'm  going to write  up a cable  yeah  me and Dick Cheney  we had such a  good time  shoving that  rag down his  throat  but no you 
[02:44:30]  don't  I think the  winner in this  is probably  you're probably  right  the State  Department  comes across  looking pretty  pragmatic  pretty you know  sharper than you  would have expected  right  they're having  some reasoned  discussion  Clinton probably  is the winner  I hate to say  it that way  but she looks  better than I  think people  would have  anticipated  because she's  running a  pretty sharp  pretty analytical  aggressive group  there that's not  really known for  any of those  things  why is she  saying that  this is her  last public  office and  she's embarrassed  I don't understand  what is her  issue  she needs to 
[02:45:00]  get away so  that she can  start raising  funds to run  for president  that's my  theory  I think she's  going to make  a run for it  I thought she  said she  wouldn't do that  in 12 or  you think she's  going to wait  12 yeah  I think  their assessment  I think  you've got all  these people  that are  disappointed  with Obama  at this point  who voted  for him  and yet they  feel good  about themselves  because they  voted for  the first  African American  president  so I can  feel good  about myself  and now  you get a  chance to  vote for  the first  woman president  so you  you get a  double dose  of feeling  good  I'm not 
[02:45:30]  saying that's  the only  reason  but there's  probably a  good strategy  here if she  gets out  in time  but having  said that  she'll probably  run through  the State  Department  until 212  she's a lot  more lower  key than  Condoleezza Rice  was  like you  always knew  where Condoleezza  Rice was  and what she  was doing  and it seems  like with Hillary  months go by  and it's like  where the hell  has she been  like there's  never any  real news  or footage  of her  overseas  talking with  diplomats 
[02:46:00]  or world  leaders  or anything  you rarely  see that  yeah she's  been a team  player I guess  is probably  the way to put it  yeah  not very  confrontational  I guess  honestly there's  a lot of  people I think  out there  that think  man I wish  she'd been  running instead  of Obama  oh really  at the end  of the day  I hate to say  this because  I don't have  a dog in the  hunt  I wouldn't  have voted  for either  but I think  she actually  would have  probably been  tougher  I think  she's tougher  than he is  too actually  on foreign  policy  and all that  stuff  he does  seem to  well the  initial thing  when he went  out on the  Air Force One 
[02:46:30]  apology tour  it was just  embarrassing  how he was  going to  clean up  George W's  world mess  by going around  and bowing  and shaking  hands  and flying  all over the  place  with I'm  sorry  painted on  the bottom  of Air Force  One  it just  it really  looked weak  and it was  him trying  so hard  to get  everyone  like us  now again  hey  there's a  new boss  here  you could  like us  now  and it  just  didn't  play  Ron  I think  they've seen 
[02:47:00]  that too  with Afghanistan  not to  blast off  there  but everybody  was expecting  okay we're  out of here  now  and look at  that  and frankly  I'm not sure  that we've  actually had a  conversation  yet as a  nation  that says  what really  is our  reason for  still being  in Afghanistan  after all  these years  is there  and talk  about  ungrateful  I mean  it's not  just that  they're  ungrateful  they don't  even know  why we're  there  they have  no clue  they're still  so broken  up and  there's no  unity between 
[02:47:30]  their people  it's these  warlord  mentalities  that they got  going over  there  what are we  doing over  there at  this point  I mean  we went  after Bin  Laden  we didn't  get him  there  we got  close  we didn't  go after  him  man  there's a  reason why  we didn't  catch him  there was  a deal  made  god  you're probably  just sitting  there going  I was just  talking to  that guy  last week  we know  exactly where  he is  they went  in  they did 
[02:48:00]  a great  job  right after  9-11  we should  have used  the lessons  of our  recent past  we spent  a lot of  time getting  the Soviets  out of  there  and the  Soviets  got into  Afghanistan  and then  inside of  about three  years  inside the  Politburo  they made  the decision  we got  to get  the hell  out  there's  no reason  for us  to be  here  it took  them  five years  to get  the hell  out  of there  they didn't  want to  look bad  and they  didn't know  what to do  about the  government  how are we  going to  leave a  stable  government  they couldn't  control the  countryside  so they  retreated to  the cities  what does  all this  sound like  and yet  we want  to stand  around  and say  we've  got this  brand new  strategy 
[02:48:30]  it's  the same  why is  Afghanistan  such a tough  country to  control  for a  variety of  reasons  obviously a lot  of people say  you'll never  win  you hear that  a lot  why is that  well there's a lot  of things that  go into it  I mean just  very simple  topography  it's like the  mountains of  the moon  right  I mean  there's trying  to control  a country  that size  with so  little  capability  to move  you know  and that's  why there's  this heavy  reliance  on helicopters  on air  traffic  and then  there's the  notion that 
[02:49:00]  this is all  they've got  right  I mean where  are they  going to go  we didn't  learn that  lesson I don't  think even  from Vietnam  there's no  place else  for them  to go  we keep  talking about  well we've  got the  Taliban on  the run  and they've  got less  territory  well good luck  Sherlock  we're going  to leave  there  and a year  later  what do we  think  they set up  someplace else  they're just  going to come  back  they have  nowhere to go  it's all  the Afghans  know  I mean  we go out  and we  look at big  black asses  for a hobby  they go out  and fight  each other  for a hobby  that's what  they do  illiteracy  rates  lack of 
[02:49:30]  understanding  as to what  the hell  we talk  about  when we  mean  democracy  and then  like you  said  this  incredible  fragmented  society  where  my only  allegiance  is to  the elder  in my  village  there's no  unity  and the topography  is just  impenetrable  amazing  we kind of  have to break  just for  show purposes  but can we  continue Mike  sure  are you promoting  anything  yeah  I'm editor  in chief  of straight  stunting  magazine  we're going  to send 
[02:50:00]  out free  subscriptions  to every  listener  today  no you  know  I'm working  on a couple  of things  but mom's  the word  got to keep  it secret  but yeah  the company  diligence  for all your  information  and security  needs  let me spell  it real quick  D-I-L-I-G-E-N-C-E  that's the one  alright  D-I-L-I-N-C-E  show  on the  virus  expect  them

[02:51:30]  in the hallway  I tell them  this  I say  don't say  anything  to anybody  keep it  quiet  mom's the  word  your acting  is better  than I do  that's the  classification  mom's  I've been  taking an acting  class  dude that was  actually really  good  I really  believe  that you  are  so far  saying no  to all the  commercials  they're  throwing at  me  no fucking  commercials  for me  is that a CIA  term  when you say  mom's the word  it means you  can't say  anything  usually you  see that  in the front  of files  what is the 
[02:52:00]  code word  yammy doll  mean  yammy  yammy means  not dissemination  yes  Mike  we'll get  back to  Mike Baker  in a second  because you  will really  appreciate this  there was a  whole thing  going on  during the  break  right Sam  oh yes  we need to  bring Mars  in here  immediately  it's quick  ok  it's quick  and it has  something to do  with what  you said  going into  break  oh Mars  is going to  commit suicide  yay  where is he

[02:53:00]  people  yeah  have you ever  had one of  her cakes  I didn't say  they were  terrific  no they are  hey man  people are  getting to  the imagine  mosaic  man  oh great  there's gonna  be people  there all  day  there's gonna  be crazy  people there  all day  that's why  I gotta be  there  I gotta be  with my  crazies  Lennon  mourner  it's like  what are you  mourning over  it's been  30 years  30 years  30 years  I remember  it like  yesterday  if Ozzy  got shot  I'd probably  show up  guess what 
[02:53:30]  would ya  every year  for 30 years  no  my dad  has been  dead  for 6 years  guess what  my morning's  over  and it was  a very tragic  thing  and I was  bummed for  a bunch of  years  but the  morning process  is over  now I  reflect  hi Mars  yes sir  I hear there  was a big  argument going  on in the  hallways  instead of  maybe I  don't know  doing your  job  but whatever  what was the  big argument  over  no big  argument  there was  an argument  what 
[02:54:00]  the word  sting  well his  name  sting  is here  yes  yes  what about  him  he says  I was  pronouncing  it incorrectly  no  how do you  pronounce it  sting  right but  is there a  silent letter  in the word  silent g  so it's  sting  you look it up  on the dictionary  so how do you  pronounce his name  sting  but you're  saying sting  but I'm not  pronouncing the g  yes you are  yes you are  you're saying  sting  you're saying  it's a silent g  but then you're  pronouncing the g 
[02:54:30]  look it up in  Webster's man  there's no  but then his name  would be sting  say kicking  kicking  say sting  sting  are they both  silent g's  bro look it up  we don't need to  look it up  we're talking to you  follow Webster  how would you  pronounce Bing  Crosby  ah that's right  is that silent  what  say Bing  Bing  sting  sting  but you are  not  you're saying  the g  is silent  yet every time  you say sting  you're pronouncing 
[02:55:00]  the g  here's how you  should say it  stin  wouldn't it just  be stin  well look it up  in Webster  no we don't need  to  I don't care  what Webster  says I speak  I've been doing  this for 42  years talking  English  stin  s-t-i-n  with no g  how do you  pronounce sting  if the g  was silent  say b-sting  b-sting  now  what's his name  sting  but the g  is silent  but you're  saying the g  is silent  now say his  name  wait wait wait 
[02:55:30]  now say his  name as if  there was no  g at all  in it  stin  okay  now pronounce  it with the  silent g  sting  I don't  understand  this doesn't  make any  sense  it's almost  a miracle  you can  remember to  feed yourself  how does  that make  sense in  your head  you're  pronouncing  a silent  g  you want us  to look up  look it up  in Webster's  there's no g  there  but it doesn't  matter what  they say  see the  problem's  with you 
[02:56:00]  not with  the  regardless  with the  rules  even if  it was  true  even if  it was  true  and there  is a  silent g  you're not  pronouncing it  with the  silent g  you're  pronouncing  the g  and his  name  wouldn't  be in  Webster  it's a  proper  name  okay  I looked  up the  word sting  yes  okay  and there  is  in the  pronunciation  they have  no g  you sure  you weren't  looking at  its sign  I'm sorry  nothing  you know  Roland's  favorite band  Bruce  Springsteen  Springsteen 
[02:56:30]  Bruce  Springsteen  Mars  yes  in Webster's  or any  dictionary  the g  is not  silent  all right  but even  if it was  then you have  to make  the g  silent  yeah  you're not  doing it  you're not  saying  you're saying  one thing  you're doing  the other  s-t-i-n  should sound  the same  as s-t-i-n-g  with a silent g  because if the g  is silent  if you did the math  correct  here you go  where does it  say Mars  to  I like the  furrowed brow  that he's got  right now 
[02:57:00]  I know  he's really  concentrating  I think you can  hear it too  hold on  sting  it pronounces it  put the mic there  no Mars  you're right  you're right  sting  you're right  I couldn't hear  the j-king  sting  who's your  favorite dog  ring-ting-ting  what happened  now Mars  is gonna  look something up  what are you doing  Mars  Mars is looking  it up himself  on Webster  he doesn't believe  he doesn't believe 
[02:57:30]  the computer  Mars.com  yes  Steven S.  from Bayshore  is saying  Mars runs  spicky leaks  that's terrible  really is terrible  okay let's see  see that down there  thanks guy  alright what are you  trying to  that's not an N  though  what is he pointing at  is that a G  it's a symbol  oh my god  wait a minute  it's a verb  and you're on the verb  anyway not the noun  that is just the  that's not an N 
[02:58:00]  that's a symbol  for pronunciation  it doesn't even  matter what he thinks  if he thinks that  then why is he  pronouncing the  silent G  that's all I want to know  turn the volume up  and let him hit the  speaker  hit the little  speaker thing up there  yeah this will prove  your point  prove your point  here we go  alright there you go  prove your point  here it is  go ahead  yeah there you go  it's silent  it's a silent word  the whole word is  silent  his name is  the whole word is 
[02:58:30]  silent  Mars  you are so not  winning this one  alright  so once again  it's a silent G  how do you say his  name  stink  I don't get it  he's hysterical  we got Mike Baker  in studio  and Mike  I apologize  ahead of time  because I swear to god  I have no idea  what this means  but someone is  very mad  that we're giving  you softball questions  well we don't  stop the fucking  softballs  and ask him about  some real shit  like MKUltra  and CIA  drug planes 
[02:59:00]  that crashed  where's the guy  it's on instant feedback  I don't even know  what that means  you know what it means  it means  you're not going to talk  it means I'm not going to talk  but it means  there's a lot of people  out there  that believe all sorts  of things  about the agency  here's what I think  I think everybody  should have to do  some national service  whether it's in the military  or whether it's  some other organization  within the government  for say two years  everybody should have  to do national service  and then one of the  great results of that  will be  we'll get rid of a lot 
[02:59:30]  of the conspiracy theorists  and the people that believe  that's sort of the  one world government  because once you get  inside the government  even a place like the CIA  which is a very high speed  terrific place to be  you realize  you know  there's idiots there too  yeah  it's all the same thing  when you go to a job  there's idiots there  there's alright people  there's cool guys  exactly  and you know what  sometimes the government  couldn't organize  you know whatever  panic in a doom submarine  what is that guy  getting at though  what is he referring to  you know what  who knows  he may be referring 
[03:00:00]  to the voices in his mind  but  what about the FEMA camps  I know there's a conspiracy  about the FEMA camps  why do you think Jesse's losing his mind  as far as conspiracies go  or did he always think like this  and we just had no idea  or is that just his thing now  like he's married to that  because  he's the guy  all these zilches look to  what do you think  what do you think is going on there  you know what  it's very appealing to think  that you know  that somehow  the agency or whatever 
[03:00:30]  you know  there's a cabal  controlling the world  and  you know  the reality half the time  is nowhere near as interesting  as some of the crap  that gets put out there  you know  it's a very straightforward  the agency is a very straightforward place  we're told what to do  you're told to go get some information  you figure out where the information resides  who's got access to it  how do you get that information  and do it  and you know  your tasking is pretty much  directed by the administration  I don't want to make it sound  overly boring  but  it's a pretty straightforward operation  how did you get the gig  like  how did you get the 
[03:01:00]  I applied  I applied  it was like a  it was like a reality show  you know  and I lasted  no it was  did you give covert information  about Blue Star Airlines  and then quickly  can we bring back the  the Sten guy  the Sten guy  yeah  but  no I ended up  I wasn't intending to go into it  I just  you know  it's kind of a long security  what were you doing before  oddly enough  I was  first job was a news director  at an AM FM radio station 
[03:01:30]  Jesus  out of the middle of nowhere  you go from that  to the CIA  that means we can be CIA agents  oh yeah  who's to say that you're not already  ah  see  look at that  I think everybody in the room is  that's why I live in Mexico  half my life  what about Sarah Palin  not an agent  not an agent  not an agent  what's her fucking malfunction  have you met her  no but you know  I know some folks  who have worked on her  worked on her campaign 
[03:02:00]  back during the  the presidential elections  here's what I think about her  she's smarter than a lot of people  give her credit for  but is she presidential material  oh my god  what the hell is this all about  she's a very  she's a very nice  very approachable  very intelligent person  which  you know  and she got beat up  during the course of that  yeah  but now what's happening is  when I think  when I think MILF by the way  I think Sarah Palin  you think Sarah Palin  oh fuck yeah  oh yeah  would you Mike  if no one's looking  would you  how do I  how do I go about 
[03:02:30]  answering this one  that's not  that's not a softball question  by the way  we play the would you game  on this show  would you  would you Sarah Palin  or  Sarah  or  or Yammy  yeah  oh god  oh please  Yammy  for president  you know Yammy looks  more athletic  it certainly does  but I think the Dems  are basically  you know  this is a heyday  for them right now  they're pushing her  you know  you see all this talk  about is she the next Reagan  lots of talk about  maybe she's a serious  presidential candidate  well of course  that's the left 
[03:03:00]  you know  trying to keep her  in the news  because they want  yeah  you notice  they're not bashing her  like they were  suddenly she seems  pretty smart  yeah because they want her  to run against  because it's a  bum ticket  I think that she would  I think that  I think she cost  McCain the election  and I really do think  that people keep saying  she's dangerous  she's not dangerous  I get so annoyed  she's dangerous to the ticket  I'm not  meaning  I'm not crazy  like I don't  I think she's way too  conservative for me  I would never vote for her  but she's just a 
[03:03:30]  conservative lady  can people stop  acting like she's  the fucking devil  bunch of babies  out there  she's just a conservative  lady with glasses  oh yeah  they did the same thing  with Cheney  Dick Cheney  he's the devil  and his head spins around  and he's going to kill us all  you ever run into  Dick Cheney in the hallways  or anything  no but you know  I've got some  connections there  through my wife  who knows the family  and he's a great guy  he's the sort of guy  that you'd want to sit down 
[03:04:00]  and have a beer with  as long as he's not  carrying a loaded weapon  would you sneak up  behind him  and scare him  see what happens  hey we got a guy  that's very upset  that  I have a different opinion  about Cheney too  by the way  John Chicago thinks  we're very uneducated  uneducated degenerates  yes John go ahead  we give everyone  a voice on the show  go ahead sir  wait seven fucking minutes  over here  seven now  I got a guy  that's been waiting  an hour and a half  that'll never make  the show today  but go ahead  go ahead 
[03:04:30]  what's up sir  go ahead John  you sound educated  go ahead John  if the gene is silent  it affects the fucking  pronunciation of the eye  maybe if you guys  took a minute  to stop fucking  picking the genital warts  off Norton's cock  and pick up a book  you'd know that  you sound like a reader  John  I love the Chicago accent  first of all  I thought he was  going to hit us  on some political front  it was the sting thing  we said sting right  that's all that matters  I knew how to say it  second all  he got all the words  off his cock 
[03:05:00]  about an hour ago  we're supposed to  pronounce it stin  yeah what are you  saying sir  yes  I think it makes  the eye  it makes a fucking  long eye  oh like Stein  yeah  that's a fascinating  call  Stein  that's a fucking  fascinating call  I'm a fascinating  guy  I love this guy  what an ass  I love this fucking  guy  with that deep  Chicago accent  and everything  that's funny  oh yeah  John  alright  John rules 
[03:05:30]  end on a high note  John's an ass  goodbye John  I love that guy  oh okay  the feedback  was talking about  how Alex Jones  claims the CIA  imports drugs  ah  the CIA  imports drugs  are you a fan  of the Alex Jones  people  no I'm not a fan  of the whole theory  they've been talking  about that for a long time  it's been out there  for decades  about how the  agency funds  its operations  by moving drugs  all around the world  and everyone knows  it's prostitution  yeah of course  it's knock off  copies of handbags 
[03:06:00]  and counterfeiting  fashion items  but is that  you're a CIA guy  but is that  I'm not a conspiracy  at all  but is that so crazy  considering like  Iran  the Contra deal  and I'm not  shit on the CIA  I'm saying that  in this world  to get things done  look  there's dirty stuff  done  isn't that crazy  a stretch  to think  there are people  let's say  there's elements  in all agencies  that may do things  outside the box  to fund bigger  and better things  you pay  a lot of unsavory people  there's no doubt 
[03:06:30]  about that  you've got to  get intelligence  so a lot of times  unfortunately  people with less  stellar reputations  are the targets  so sometimes  you've got to  deal with people  that you don't  necessarily want  to deal with  moving drugs  no  but no one's  going to believe me  because that's  exactly what  people would  expect me to say  company line  is your phone  ringing  I want to put  River right dog  on the phone  here  injured  right River  you got injured  overseas huh  Roger 
[03:07:00]  thank you  that's really  not the focus  Mr. Baker  thank you  it's  hello  where did he go  oh he was killed  that happens to a lot  of people  like call makers  right there  see what he just did  Mike shook his head  no and the guy  just ceased to exist  see what happened  right there  that's the way  the CIA  got some scary shit  he was on the phone  in the crosshairs  Mike gave the fucking  word and that was it  that's it  that's all it takes  you know what I  noticed too  about conspiracy  guys 
[03:07:30]  like Jesse  Jesse  and Jesse has  said things I  actually like  but he'll always  raise the gulf  of Tomkin  incident  and maybe that  was a terrible  incident  but you know  what  that's the  government  there's a lot  of people  no one who  is in government  then is in  government now  so what he's  saying is because  the government  did that  they can never  be trusted  right  but then how  come you can't  look at something  very positive and  good the government  did and then  forever trust them  with it  it's almost like 
[03:08:00]  you never hear  conspiracy guys  it's always  damned if you do  damned if you don't  Jimmy  but you know what I'm  saying like  you never  there are people  who are naive  too going  America will  over or leave it  thinking America  is always right  and we're never  dirty  but those guys  were always  gulf of Tomkin  but they won't  say take another  incident that was  very positive  and very forthcoming  and very generous  and use that  as a 40 year later  example  do you understand  what I mean  look what happens  in a place like  Afghanistan  where you got  constant shifting  alliances right  and you're dealing  with a lot of  people  that's the name 
[03:08:30]  of my band  by the way  shifting alliances  that is an awful  band  it's a cover band  isn't it  yes  we play Doobie  Brothers  kind of mixed  with Ludacris  oh that sounds  awful  it's really good  what a motherfucking  fool believes  let's go ahead  Mike I apologize  I'm just trying to  imagine what your  fly girls would look  like  on stage  on stage  dancing  should he kiss his back  by the way  yeah he's going to  admit the CIA  deals drugs  live in the air  obviously  good point 
[03:09:00]  but obviously  you know  on instant feedback  the guy on instant  feedback  who's writing in  knows  the CIA guy  next to us  doesn't know  right  stop  and we got River  at dock back  and I think it is  important that you  got injured  serving for the  country there  River  Roger  I appreciate that  I try and  look beyond that  and I don't  want to get  bogged down  because I  like that  notes written  out here  so I don't  sound too  fumbled fingers  but Mr. Baker  I wanted to 
[03:09:30]  thank you  because I  really like  and appreciate  when you're  on the red  eye  and on the  opening  show  but I have a  question for you  that PFC  that was  over there  that opened  up all  of this  he was  currently being  chapter  and he  was flagged  and he  had been  busted  from E4  to E3  prior to  deployment  okay  he ended up  getting  his TS  clearance  even if it  was an  interim  one  and then  the second  question I  have as a  follow up  is that 
[03:10:00]  even on the  siper net  over there  and I was  part of the  RSO  for the  Iraqi embassy  on my  second tour  I surfed  around on  the siper net  a lot  but I damn  sure never  came across  embassy  communique  and some  of this  other stuff  that he  has  so  yeah he  had pretty  far reaching  access  but I mean  you pointed  out to a  thanks well  first of all  thanks for  your service  but he  he had  very far  ranging  access  but you  pointed out  a really  important part  which is  that he  was to  some degree 
[03:10:30]  on a  radar screen  right  and whether  it's him  or whether  it's the  Fort Hood  shooter  or whatever  it's an  imperfect  system  unfortunately  and so  it doesn't  move  in part  because it's  the government  so  or military  it doesn't  move  with the  speed  that most  people  you know  you and I  would think  is common  sense  you spot a  problem  well fine  shut it  down  you know  give him  a job  that doesn't  require any  thinking or  responsibility  certainly no  access  they had  busted him  down  from  I didn't  know that  his local  intelligence  officer  at his  unit level 
[03:11:00]  starting with  his commander  his battalion  commander  and then the  local  F2 officer  in his  battalion  when they get  flagged  that's the first  thing you do  to soldiers  is you go  from a  TS down to  you know  need to know  or you know  just to google  just to google  to use google earth  but he didn't  you know  he didn't  have access  to top  secret  you know  and I'm  not sure  exactly  when that 
[03:11:30]  was  taken care  of  but  at the same  time  it's very  important  to understand  because  it's like  what we were  talking about  before  with the  conspiracy  theories  you know  what  I mean  unfortunately  it's not  black and  white  you know  shit happens  and it  shouldn't  happen  and what  you gotta  do  is learn  from it  but  unfortunately  we do  seem to  have a  history  of  identifying  potential  problem  cases  or individuals  and then  taking far  too long  to get  it resolved  it's just  like  you know  James 
[03:12:00]  Jono  is running  around  saying  that  he's a  SEAL  and that  he has  TS clearance  he doesn't  have his  TS clearance  anymore  and I don't  know why  any federal  official  hasn't  stepped  out  and said  hey  it's  been  downgraded  and  I also  have a  request  in through  soft check  at  Veriseal  you know  to get  back their  official answer  on  somebody  who served  in Thailand  on UDT-12  can run  around  and say  I was  a Navy  SEAL  and they  comment on  personnel  and their  clearance  maybe they  won't comment 
[03:12:30]  on personnel  and clearance  under any  circumstances  I think  him being  a high  priority  person  or high  visible  person  they're  going to  have a  pre-printed  answer  that they're  going to  be sending  back to  me  but  you can  run  through  soft check  at  Veriseal  and  anybody  who claims  their  SEAL  or part  of  any  SOC  unit  or  anything  like  that  and  they'll  bounce  back  this guy's  working at  home  Jesus  sending out  requests  why do you look at porn  like the rest of us  he does  this is porn to him 
[03:13:00]  actually  oh god  oh the JFK documents  oh yeah by the way  where's all that from  WikiLeaks  where's all the big JFK  stuff  where's the 9-11  conspiracy stuff  none of it  there is that  there is that one cable  that state department  cable  that says  my god  I hope they don't  find about the  MK drug flights  that the agency's  running out of here  where's that stuff  what do you think  honestly though  I don't know  we touched on this  because I know  everybody is saying  like  does this terabyte  hard drive  contain  tickets for the 
[03:13:30]  third Atlantic City  show  and it does not  oh damn  it does not  oh he got me  not enough  because everybody  was saying  like look  myself and  Brewer and  Attel  Bill Burr  we sold out  the first two  and the third  and final  January 15th  11 o'clock show  is being put on sale  Friday morning  at 10 o'clock  that's not what  this is about  this is about  the leaks  so stop obsessing  about my tickets  and where's Mike Baker  going to be leaking  anywhere  no you know what  I'm going to be at that  show though  I tell you much  people are already  talking about it  the entire agency 
[03:14:00]  is excited about  that show  I'd hate to do  an entire CIA show  can you have your  boy steal his  hard drive  we just need to  know  what do you think  honestly I'll say  this  nothing illegal  really  of course  that type of  porn just doesn't  get me off  animal  animal kid stuff  does not  I just couldn't  even comprehend  wanting that  I was talking  about kid animals  oh yeah  baby animals  I like cubs  that's a niche 
[03:14:30]  group isn't it  very hard to  trade with other  people  I just like when  you tickle the  panda stomach  and it goes  he he  and his little  panda legs  open  who doesn't  like a nice  horsey video  but I  my porn is  pretty run  of the tranny  mill  I mean it's  not  it's nothing  crazy  at all  it's very  you know  A B  C's with  D's  fantastic  and Mike Baker 
[03:15:00]  a great  thank you again  always  always a pleasure  always intriguing  I love that  stuff  and I  appreciate  you're a good  sport there  Mike  no no  it's the best  show on the  planet  you're a guy  I'm always happy  yeah but he  didn't say if he  would have sex  with Yammy  I believe I did  I said if there's a  ticking time bomb  situation  if I was  suddenly  to save the  country  or the world  to save the  world  it might have to be  the world  no I'd be the  country  it could actually  be the east coast  Anthony to save the  world  to save the world
