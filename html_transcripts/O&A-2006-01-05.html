<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast from the Consumer Electronics Show (CES) in Las Vegas was a whirlwind of celebrity guests, technological gadgetry, and unrestrained, often offensive, humor.  The show opened with Opie recounting his grueling 15-hour journey to Las Vegas due to a canceled flight, peppered with racist remarks about Asians and punctuated by sexually explicit jokes.  This was followed by a discussion of the new XM Satellite Radio gadgets showcased at CES, including the Inno and Helix, along with their features.

A surprise in-studio guest was Boomer Esiason, a former NFL quarterback and Anthony's childhood acquaintance.  Their segment focused on their often-combative elementary school memories, including physical fights and bullying.  George Wallace, a comedian with a Las Vegas residency, joined the show, discussing his technological ineptitude, his friendship with Jerry Seinfeld (including a bizarre anecdote about Seinfeld's son's bris), and his own show.  Laszlo, the show's technology correspondent at CES, also contributed to the technological discussions.  Comedians Bill Burr and Rich Vos made brief appearances to promote their shows.

Jimmy Norton's involvement with a porn convention was a significant topic, with explicit details about award categories like "best anal sex" and "best ethnic theme series Asian."  The discussion then flowed to digital cameras, video iPods, and the convergence of technology, interspersed with crude masturbation jokes and phone conversation anecdotes.

Steve, a show staffer, called in to relate a flight experience with comedian Benjy Bronk, detailing Bronk's excessive alcohol consumption and unusual sleeping habits.  The conversation returned to CES gadgets, including heads-up displays and a smell-o-vision device, further seasoned with crude humor.  Alice Cooper then joined the studio, discussing his technological illiteracy, email versus phone calls, musical preferences, his encounter with Groucho Marx, his golf game, his views on the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, and anecdotes from past tours, including a shocking story about a death metal band that cannibalized their lead singer.  His appearance was interspersed with promotions for his concert DVD and further riffing on CES gadgets and crude humor.  The segment included a Dick Clark audio clip and more promotional announcements.

A phone call from Kimmy, an adult film star, detailed her masturbation habits while listening to the show, and discussed the impact of technology and new laws on the adult film industry.  This conversation was explicitly sexual and was cut short by technical difficulties.  The hosts then discussed GPS tagging in digital cameras and its potential use for parental surveillance, along with stories from their previous year's antics with "Club Soda Kenny," including audio clips recorded by Keith the Cop and Kenny, featuring a recurring "you dropped something" gag.  Anthony's gambling habits and Kenny's unique betting commentary were also discussed.

The show's closing moments covered the show's length, gifts received (or not received), upcoming CES meetings, the success of XM radio, Anthony's gambling plans, and concluded with a commercial for Chaser hangover prevention pills.  Throughout the entire broadcast, sexually explicit discussions, racist remarks, and crude humor were prevalent.

[00:03:00]  www.fizz.com  Radio Bad Boys, Opie and Anthony are about to make their return to the airwaves. 
[00:03:30]  Opie and Anthony were pulled from the airwaves two years ago after a sex stunt at St. Patrick's Cathedral.  Opie and Anthony are back, so why won't the FCC be able to test them this time?  The duo has signed with XM Satellite Radio.  Their contract with Infinity expired back in May, but the no-compete portion is up until October. 
[00:04:00]  No arrests have been made. Police are still investigating.  We're calling! We're calling!  Let's do it!  Let's do it!  Let's do it!  The blonde one, uh...  Our society needs borders.  It needs parameters.  You dick!  They get their jollies by saying, let's keep pushing the envelope.  They were doing what they were paid to do.  Even when they're about to be made, there's a price to be paid in terms of the cultural degradation that we do not want to be associated with anymore. 
[00:04:30]  Are you adequately prepared to rock, rock, rock, rock?  But enough of this palaver. Let's get the show on the road.  Show on the road. The show is on the road. We're in Vegas.  We are in Vegas.  Welcome to the Opie and Anthony program. The ONA virus spreading across America.  Oh, thanks XM Satellite Radio. 
[00:05:00]  Bless you.  We're in Las Vegas, Nevada for the CES, Anthony.  Yes.  The Consumer Electronics Show.  And we have, uh, we have so much to do, but right off the bat, we have to say hi to Eric Logan, our big boss here.  Yes.  Is this mic on?  Turn the mic on.  No.  No, his mic's not on.  Oh, there we go.  There it is.  There we go.  Uh, Eric Logan has been passing out the new gadgets, the new XM gadgets.  These are all the stuff that was, uh, in the secret room, by the way.  Uh, if you remember, I know the new listeners might not, uh, know what this is, but months 
[00:05:30]  and months and months ago, Opie went to this, uh, XM event in New York City.  There was a secret back room.  And, uh, a lot of this new technology was there for only a privileged few to see.  Right.  Opie, you were not privileged enough that day to see the, uh, secret back room.  And now we're getting to see all the gadgets that were in there.  And considering how long it took me to get here yesterday, I'm still not privileged, by  the way.  Yes.  We'll get into my 15-hour journey to Vegas a little later in the program.  I never knew, uh, they actually took you through New Zealand before, uh, coming to Vegas. 
[00:06:00]  I could have been in Australia.  Yeah.  Simple as that.  But, uh, I wanted to stop by just to first of all welcome you guys to CES again.  Thank you, sir.  And a much bigger crowd, now that people know that you're on XM Satellite Radio.  Yeah, this is much better than the first time we were here, where we were on the air  for a couple of months.  Yeah.  And we came here, there was, uh...  Like, who?  Right.  A cricket chirping that we couldn't get off the mic, and three people.  Three people showed up to say hi.  But I wanted to jump in, because you have such a limited amount of time today. 
[00:06:30]  I know Anthony was very frustrated with my Christmas gifts, because I gave gift cards, and  the level probably...  Did you?  Wasn't too inappropriate.  Yours is a new car.  Did you?  Your home address is...  But I do, but Anthony, I just want to tell you, I personally brought you a Christmas  present today.  Are you kidding me?  I'll be right back.  Excuse me, I'll be right back.  Eric Logan, I now am very excited.  No, you're not.  Because you're going to freak out in about two seconds.  Am I really?  Yes, you are.  Oh, my God.  Holy...  Boomer Esiason, everyone. 
[00:07:00]  Giving Anthony a big hug.  There's a major backstory.  Wow!  Boomer Esiason and Anthony went to school together.  East Isle, Timber Point Elementary School.  That's right.  I remember beating you up a few times.  Yes.  Boomer...  And actually, I've heard you talk about that quite a few times.  Holy shit.  And I think you've gotten it screwed up a little bit.  I did?  You never hit me.  No, no.  I hit you in the head.  You, like, laughed at me, and I broke both bones in my arm. 
[00:07:30]  Yeah, I don't think you hit me in the head.  Actually, I think I remember breaking your jaw.  That's what I remember.  No, never broken jaw.  By the way, that must have been another poor son of a bitch that got in your way.  Maybe that was your brother, Joey.  It could have been.  It could have been.  No, I don't remember if he broke his jaw.  You were the biggest bully in that school.  The guy was, like, the coach's...  I was not.  He was the coach's, like, guy.  I took care of everybody.  I took care of all the little people.  You used to take...  Except for you.  In the cafeteria, this son of a bitch would grab people by the head and put their heads 
[00:08:00]  by his ass and fart.  Oh, I did.  Yes, you did.  You were that guy.  It was horrid stuff that I remember as a child.  So you're blaming me for the way you are now.  Is that what I understand?  Well, in the situation I'm in now, I would have to thank you, because it all worked out  fine.  I was back there telling your girlfriend all about it, so...  Greg, oh, good.  Yeah, great.  I want to hear the story once again.  Thanks, Boomer.  I want to hear the story again.  Well, here's how it went.  Boomer...  According to you. 
[00:08:30]  According to me.  According to you.  This is my memory of Timber Point Elementary School.  Boomer never, ever, ever liked being called Norman.  Especially back in the old...  Look at the look he just gave.  Oh, Jesus.  They're going to fight!  As soon as you said that, the look he gave all of us.  That's just the way it was.  That is not true.  He's trying to figure out whose jaw he wants to break first.  No, I don't know.  This is just...  It's turned into urban myth.  Right.  This was just the way it kind of went at the time.  Well, your urban myth.  My urban myth. 
[00:09:00]  My side of it.  For some reason, in front of my friends, I thought it would be funny, as his back was  turned, going around the corner to yell out Norman.  Does that surprise you?  Not at all.  And I did it.  And someone ratted me out and said, you know, that I had been calling you Norman.  There was one of those I call you out things after school.  And we went outside.  It was a little cold.  I had a big, heavy jacket on.  And, you know, everybody that fought back then took their jacket off. 
[00:09:30]  And you did, too.  I wanted to leave as much padding on as it was humanly possible, because I knew it was  over, Johnny, for me.  We kind of squared off.  I do remember getting one shot in and hit you in the forehead.  But it was nothing to you.  To me, I didn't know at the time.  I knew the next day.  The ulna and radius snapped.  Both arms.  I do remember you coming back in with a cast.  With a cast on.  It was just broken.  I broke my arm.  And then you just proceeded to beat the living shit out of me. 
[00:10:00]  And it was...  Well, does that surprise anybody?  No, it doesn't surprise anybody, right?  No, it's not.  Of course not.  A guy like him needs to have his ass kicked every now and again.  And I was the fun guy at school, never causing any issues.  You were the jock.  He was the sweetheart in gym class.  No, if I remember, he used to be in Mr. Bangardi's class, because I'd walk past and  there'd be spitballs and everything flying all over the place.  So you were in that class, and it was kind of the class where nobody would pay attention. 
[00:10:30]  Right.  It was that class.  Yes, today's day, you have ADD.  Back then, they just threw you in that class.  Back then, right.  They didn't give you any medication or anything.  Why couldn't you just be stupid?  Right.  Or just be an ass or something.  But now, you know, of course, you've got to have some kind of disease.  But I do remember you, like, every...  The guy excelled at every sport.  You could not do anything.  You felt like an idiot in gym class next to this guy.  Because he was like...  You know, the coach would be like,  Hey, Boomer, go out for a pass.  And the coach would throw this bomb, and he's catching it. 
[00:11:00]  And then Boomer would throw it, and the coach would catch it.  And then that was our example.  All right, Anthony, go ahead.  Cut over to the left.  And I'm tripping over my shoelaces, wearing my skippy sneakers.  And you cut off jean shorts, right?  Oh, awful.  Yeah.  I didn't have the right clothes for Tim.  I forgot my shorts at home, so I'm in my jeans.  You had your leather jacket.  He always had a way to tweak somebody.  You know what I mean?  He always got underneath somebody's skin, somewhere along the line.  But, you know, and the amazing thing is, is when I was playing for the Jets, it was back in the frozen years. 
[00:11:30]  My mom didn't date you, did she?  No, she didn't date me.  Oh, okay.  I mean, 93, 94, and 95, when you guys were actually on, you know, I guess, F-M-O-R, you used to tell the story all the time.  Yeah.  But I would never come on with you because I just didn't want to give you that, you know, that pleasure of saying, yes, you did break your arm when you hit me.  So that's the way I felt.  But it's always good to see you, man.  That was it.  And always good to watch you and growing up in East Islip.  Is it amazing that we actually made it? 
[00:12:00]  I know.  Something actually worked out out of East Islip.  It seems like it's more amazing that he made it over you.  Yeah, I know.  At least he had something going for him.  The guy had athletic skills.  It was like obvious in high school.  I was a smartass.  There aren't really many roads for the smartass to make him.  But I will say this.  When I was playing for the Jets, people used to say all the time, this guy in OR is killing you.  It was AAF up in Boston.  Is that what it was?  Yeah.  And then NAW.  People would say to me, he's killing you.  And I'm like, I have no idea who this guy is.  Because he beat up so many friggin' people in school. 
[00:12:30]  Just one of the guys.  Let me check my files.  I think you should fart in his face again for all time.  Shut up, Jimmy.  No.  Jimmy, go on on that one.  You know, I actually, though, to think about where we were, where we grew up.  It was a great neighborhood.  It really was a great neighborhood to grow up.  There were a lot of kids.  All over the place.  It was great.  It was all about, you know, your bicycles and riding through Hexshare Park.  That's right.  And we had a lot of common friends.  A lot of mini bikes running around.  Yeah, mini bikes.  I remember that.  A lot of wrecked mini bikes. 
[00:13:00]  That's exactly right.  You know, in this day and age, you couldn't do that.  The kids, they don't do that stuff.  You know, when we were growing up, it was just go outside, go in the park.  Now, God forbid you go in the park, now somebody might snatch you or something, you know?  Yeah, true.  It was about building ramps and jumping over garbage pails with your bicycles and things  like that.  Doing the old Evel Knievel.  Way back in our early teen days.  So, what are you doing at CES?  You know, I'm actually out here for Samsung.  I'm one of the four quarterbacks that they've actually hired to, you know, promote their  product.  I'm out here with Marino, Steve Young, and Troy Aikman. 
[00:13:30]  Jesus.  You know, which is great.  You guys want to hang later?  We might hang out.  Well, maybe you guys want to come over and hang with us.  No, no.  Don't even come.  I was never able to sit at the table at lunch.  Right.  Why should I be able to hang with him now?  You know, the amazing thing is, is how pretty your girlfriend is.  I know, isn't it?  How long are you on the air for?  It's, uh, stay away from Boomer, baby.  And I can't even play.  And your girlfriend, by the way, I'm back there, Danielle, right?  Lindsay.  Lindsay.  Oh, Lindsay.  Lindsay.  Sorry.  Nice move.  You just blew it, pal.  Yeah, so many.  He's like, you know, when I met Danielle as I was coming out of the thing, but I was 
[00:14:00]  asking her, I said, so what do you do here?  He says, I do him.  I keep him happy.  Pointing to you.  And I said, I was like Boomer.  You can't even play the money card.  You know, stay away from him because, you know, at least I have money.  He's fucking Boomer.  He's got money, too.  He's got money.  Lots of money.  So I hear you're moving to Roslyn Heights, huh?  Ah, could be.  That's one of the areas we're looking at.  Yeah, yeah.  So we'll be neighbors again.  Oh, you're in that area?  Manhasset.  Jesus.  You can't get rid of him.  Boomer, don't hurt me anymore.  Sorry.  Where are you guys moving, by the way?  I would love to go out to dinner one night. 
[00:14:30]  Oh, really?  Yeah.  All right, good.  Absolutely.  That wasn't a yes, by the way.  I know.  That was a yes.  I tried to, you know, patch things up a little, make it a little more less uncomfortable.  It doesn't matter how successful you are.  You're still in that high school mindset.  I still feel like I'm in the cafeteria and he's going to steal my chocolate milk.  He's one of the cool kids you want to hang out with.  It's never going to happen.  He was always at the, yeah, yeah, the cool guy jock table.  And I was at the, you know.  The cool guy jock table.  The piece of crap table.  You've got to let it go, man.  Just let it go.  It's very hard to let go.  I don't really let it affect me, but it's hard to remember it. 
[00:15:00]  It doesn't affect you.  You know, it's like, it just happened that way.  And as a memory, it's just, it's the way it was.  There's nothing to be ashamed of.  I mean, we're all humiliated and emasculated growing up.  I mean, now it's just being talked about in front of the entire country.  I don't remember humiliating.  All I remember him is him hitting me and breaking his arms.  How do I humiliate him?  How is that humiliating?  He's lucky you didn't rip his dress off.  Well, listen, you know what?  You guys are great. 
[00:15:30]  I listen to you all the time on my XM radio and my GM UConn XL.  Very nice.  Very good.  So you guys are great.  And it's always great to see you.  And what?  You did okay.  You did all right.  No matter what they said, you were most likely to fail.  That's what you were voted.  Yeah, well, you know.  The fact of the matter, you've made it.  You've done good.  He didn't like high school.  Anthony, just, high school wasn't for him.  This was before high school, too.  Thank God.  But you moved away.  Yeah.  Oh, we were moving all the time.  I wound up in Central Iceland after East Iceland.  And talk about some fights over there. 
[00:16:00]  I wish I had Boomer beat me up.  I actually thought he went to, like, military school or something.  That's what I thought.  Send him to military school.  It might have helped.  It might have helped.  All right, Boomer.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Great surprise.  Can I have a picture with you?  Absolutely.  No.  Could you punch him like you punched me?  Yeah, please punch Jimmy.  It would give me great pleasure.  I'll see you guys a little bit later.  I'm going to go over here and talk to the girls.  Thanks.  Yeah, great.  All right, there he goes.  Boomer Esiason, everyone.  What a surprise that is.  Damn.  Good to see him.  Elo grabbed me, like, ten minutes before he went on the air and said, 
[00:16:30]  I've got a surprise for Anthony.  That's fantastic.  I'm like, I don't know how he's going to handle that one.  Nah.  How much water has to go under a bridge?  You know?  It does.  Right when he sat down, I was like, oh, jeez.  Hold on.  Doesn't that bring you right back to being in high school?  It was elementary school.  I mean, I keep saying high school, but elementary school.  Yeah, it wasn't even high school.  It was elementary school.  I was a little fan.  But right away, you're feeling like, I'm not worthy.  I just remember him being a huge, he was a huge presence back then in elementary school. 
[00:17:00]  Dude, you know you're going to be somebody, especially in sports like that,  when in elementary school, you are a huge presence.  The coach was like, you know, him and the coach.  It was those two.  He was like on equal footing with the coach.  And you knew he was doing something.  And then later on, I was in a band with a couple of guys from East Islip,  and they were always talking about Boomer.  And I told them the story, and I've been telling that story for years.  And, you know, to finally sit. 
[00:17:30]  Finally.  This many years later, to sit face to face with him.  You should have happened, punched him right in the face.  That would have been perfect.  Yeah, right?  Did you guys have broken your back?  Did you guys ever talk after that?  No, never.  That was it, right?  That was it.  Like you said, a short time later, I moved away.  And that was it.  But, yeah, to see him after so many years like that is hysterical.  Because I watched him on TV and stuff.  And that's the guy that I broke my arm on.  That's classic.  Thank you, Elo.  You're welcome.  Merry Christmas.  Merry Christmas.  All I have to do now is make Ozzy Osbourne appear. 
[00:18:00]  Oh, you guys have already done that.  Yeah, we've spoken with Ozzy.  That's great.  The new equipment that is coming out.  Unbelievable, man.  It's amazing.  I got the Pioneer in my hand.  What is it called officially?  Inno.  Inno?  Inno.  Inno.  I like the slogan.  It's not a pod.  It's the mother ship.  And this one is Helix.  This is the Samsung device.  And this is the Helix one.  I was popping it and listening to a few of the music channels on here. 
[00:18:30]  The sound, incredible.  Yeah, you can walk around and listen to it live.  That's the most important thing.  Yeah, you can listen live.  This isn't something that you need to dock with something and then take it with you later.  Right.  As some other company is pumping stuff out like that.  This is live broadcast of XM programming.  But the abilities and the extras, too many to mention.  Too many to mention.  I don't even know what the hell is going on with this.  There's recording abilities, playback.  Yeah, you know, give us the quick sell on this thing.  I can tell you this much. 
[00:19:00]  It's smaller than my BlackBerry.  Yep.  It's smaller than the Trio.  Besides the credit card.  It's the length of a credit card plus about an eighth of an inch.  Yeah, basically what you can do with this, it has a time-shifting ability where if you're  listening to deep tracks and you hear something you like, you can record and time-shift  this entire playlist.  And then you can tag certain songs.  And when you tag a Steppenwolf song or a Judas Priest song, then you dock it with XM Plus  Napster.  It will go out to Napster and say, would you like to purchase this song for 99 cents and 
[00:19:30]  get a clean copy?  And you say yes.  You can then put your own MP3s on here, too.  So what it really does is kind of blends iPods and all the MP3s and a live satellite radio.  It's the first device that brings it all together.  So it's really, I've lived with this one for about a week, it's the most amazing piece  of technology I've ever seen since probably the cell phone.  Do you believe those shitheads at Sirius still don't have something you can listen to live  programming on?  So if I want to listen to my Martha Stewart program, I have to record it and then listen  to it as I'm blowing a stranger in the car? 
[00:20:00]  That company should be fucking firebombed.  And I can't get enough of my MiFi and already I'm thinking, screw the MiFi, when do I get  one of these things?  Yeah, this is a, and the great thing, too, is like it has the sessions, you know, have  MiFi had like one or two sessions.  This one you can have unlimited sessions.  So you can say every Saturday I want to get this particular show or O&A every morning between  this time and this time.  So it's truly amazing and it interfaces with the computer and they're going to be out in  the March-April time frame in stores. 
[00:20:30]  But, but, when do we get one?  That's right.  I think depending upon who you schmooze out here, you've got one in your hands now.  I'm a schmoozing fool without even the schmoozing part.  Just ask Homer.  I'd like one.  You gave him a quarterback for Christmas.  Yeah, really?  Yeah, Jimmy and I want one of these.  Anthony got his present, right?  Oh, Jimmy, CES is early.  Your birthday is tomorrow, I do know.  It is actually tomorrow.  I don't want tomorrow.  A lot of people joke about it.  You don't want anybody to know. 
[00:21:00]  They joke about it, but it is actually January.  Good job tomorrow.  I'm going to go, I'm going to go walk around and pretend I'm important if you need me  harder.  All right, you do that.  Hilo walks around and they treat him like God.  Oh, stop it.  Nice buzz last night, by the way.  Jesus.  Enjoyed that football game, did you?  Oh, God, what a horrible game it was.  I was wondering, like, I was walking around, like, I was walking around the casino going,  where is everybody?  And they were watching the game.  He did not just get you.  I didn't do it.  Why is he looking at me? 
[00:21:30]  He's, like, looking at me like, yo.  Oh, shit.  That was Jimmy.  That was Jimmy.  He is so embarrassed.  Like, he's the big shot here.  You can't, uh...  Don't get him.  Yeah, you can't make him look bad at CES.  Don't get him.  He's the boss.  He's the boss, man.  He was, uh...  He had a long day yesterday, as did a few other people.  Fuck.  Because I know I called him up at about 4.35 in the morning when there was a little  problem with Opie's travel plan.  It's nice to know that Anthony cares.  Sometimes I, uh... 
[00:22:00]  I question.  I wanted to know how this was going to affect me.  Yeah, that's what I was wondering.  Was I going to have to do this show by myself?  I got up at...  Well, I would have been here.  Like I said.  But wait.  That's hurtful.  I, uh...  I wasn't coming to CES.  No.  As of yesterday, when, uh, me, uh, my girlfriend and the lovely Jimmy Norton were boarding our  plane, it was going to be me and Jimmy doing the show alone.  Maybe Opie back in New York.  No.  Over an ISV.  No, you weren't even going to do that. 
[00:22:30]  No.  So it was going to be just me.  Under protest, I was going to hide for about three or four days.  Uh, we all get to the airport.  We check in.  We're fine and dandy.  Uh, we get a call a few minutes later, and it's Opie.  I never saw you guys.  I was a little late.  Well, you're always late.  Always.  Well, it was...  I was going to make it in time.  Of course you were going to make it in time.  But like we said, we even got to the airport and went like, oh, we'll just see Opie running  down the runway, flagging the plane down.  I'm all about last minute when it comes to stuff like that.  Yes.  We all know.  I drove myself to the airport.  I got up at four in the morning.  I got there around 5.15-ish, I think. 
[00:23:00]  And I get up to the, uh, to the guy behind the computer and he's typing away.  Uh, uh, someone canceled one of your tickets.  I'm like, what?  Yeah.  So I'm checking in to make a long story short.  I'm, I'm set to go.  And then, uh, he types in Lindsey's name and, uh, oh, that ticket was canceled.  Canceled?  Canceled.  I'm like, what are you talking about?  Canceled.  I have to go to Vegas to see yes and then all that.  He goes, no, somebody canceled that ticket yesterday. 
[00:23:30]  We don't have any seats available on this, uh, this flight.  There's nothing we could do.  It took everything in me not to jump over the counter and strangle the guy because he  just didn't give a, he just, he just didn't give a crap on any level.  They don't care.  And I'm like, you have to at least make it look good and try to figure this problem out.  This is a huge problem.  But somewhere along the line, someone canceled the, uh, the reservation.  So no ticket for Lindsey means no ticket for the Opster.  Yeah.  I'm like, I'm not traveling alone. 
[00:24:00]  What are you like?  A 1930s guy?  Beat it, dame.  Find your own way home.  I got business in Vegas.  So I called up, uh, Don Wicklin.  I called up Anthony immediately.  I'm like, I'm not going, man.  Have fun.  And I was ready to just leave the airport.  Anthony, I guess you called Eric right away?  Oh, I immediately called, uh, Elo.  And I got somebody on the other end that kind of had, there was something.  That sounded like Elo in it, but it sounded more like someone who had just woken up from a bender.  Or just went to bed. 
[00:24:30]  The guy was, uh, what?  Hello?  Who the, who, what?  O.P. and Anthony, the show, what?  Confused.  He had no clue what to do.  So I just, man, I'm boom, boom, belting out the info to him.  And, uh, he said, all right, give me a few minutes.  I'll work on this.  Which is amazing to me because, um, to get to Vegas these, these few days, it's almost impossible.  Yeah, the CES and the, uh, AVNs are going on out here.  The adult video thing is going on.  And this time of year, you cannot get to Vegas. 
[00:25:00]  It is impossible.  Forget about direct flights, even one stopover.  Yeah.  You know, you really are going to have problems getting here.  But, uh, to Eric Logan's credit, he snapped out of his, uh, drunken stupor.  Yes, he did.  And, uh, made things happen.  He goes, watch, I will move mountains to get you to Vegas.  Just hang tight.  So I'm at LaGuardia.  He calls about a half hour later.  He's, he's like, I got a flight for you, uh, nine o'clock at JFK.  So I have to go to another airport.  And, uh, and he made it happen.  I got to give him credit.  It was amazing.  We had, uh, first class on United. 
[00:25:30]  I forgot what the service was called, but it was over the top ridiculous service.  Yeah, but it wasn't a flight to Vegas.  Nah, well.  You had a, I had to fly all the way to LA.  I had to go to LA.  I had to go to LA.  Louisiana?  No, that would have been convenient.  I get it.  And, uh, I had to fly to Los Angeles and even the pilot had to rub it in, even though he  didn't know, obviously, but I just thought he was rubbing it in because he's like, if  you look outside the left side of the aircraft, you'll see Vegas.  And I'm like, got a fucking parachute. 
[00:26:00]  Jump.  So we get to Los Angeles.  Then we had like an hour delay.  Then we had to get on another plane with a bunch of, a bunch of Asians with SARS masks  on.  Yeah.  Even here in America, for some reason, Asians, and we're talking Asians that are coming right  from some Asian country, are wearing the SARS masks.  Like they wear surgical masks because they're afraid of getting the SARS.  That's great.  They got a fucking coughing parrot on their shoulder.  How many SARS cases have there been in, maybe, you know something, maybe I'm jumping the 
[00:26:30]  gun here.  Maybe it's a courtesy and they feel they have the SARS and they don't want to spread it  to this fine country.  I just want to look at them and say, you're not that important.  Yeah.  Get a hold of yourself.  No one's going to be dead of the SARS isn't really going to affect this year.  No one's going to give a shit.  But then again, they are Asians.  One more table I could get at a blackjack.  Maybe they're all doctors.  Oh, and they're just prepared for...  Yeah.  Asshole.  So then L.A. to Vegas and we made it 15, 16 hours later. 
[00:27:00]  16 hours.  Door-to-door 16 hours.  Of traveling to get to Las Vegas.  Well, welcome.  But I got to give you a little credit.  This plane I was on for United was absolutely amazing.  Did the sleeper seats?  Have you done the sleeper seats?  Absolutely.  I woke up from a two and a half hour nap.  I thought I was in my own bed.  Yeah, they got the seats that are like their own little pods.  Right.  And they go back and the feet come up and turn into a bed.  It's not a recliner chair.  No, it turns into a bed.  This is a bed with a thick blanket. 
[00:27:30]  Mile High Club, my friend.  Mile High Club?  No, they had that big freaking bar in between us.  Yeah, but you hop in one pod.  Mile High Club.  You had the opportunity.  That's not a bad idea.  You had the opportunity.  Always wanted to do that.  You can.  What are your flight arrangements back?  I thought I was too busy dealing with my constipation in the bathroom.  Flying business first, trying to squeeze out a little rotten black pellet.  The pilot's wondering why he's got to give a little more left aileron to compensate for the weight on the right. 
[00:28:00]  I was dropping mud pies.  And you know how they don't really flush?  It's just that, what is it, a metal disc?  Well, you've got to help a rascal.  Yeah, it just opens and it kind of collapses.  It finally just gives up and lets go.  No, but if you're dropping mud pies, it sticks nice to that thing.  So I was playing help a little rascal out from New York to L.A.  With my hand and tissue.  I had to push that through.  Why?  That is disgusting.  There's nothing better than fucking wrecking the bathroom and then seeing some chick standing outside. 
[00:28:30]  That's stupid.  Go in there and fucking brush your hair.  Enjoy.  I hope you enjoyed your first class on the way there.  Because your ride back, Lee Abrams.  He's going to be flying you back in his little plane.  Well, that's right.  No first class there.  You've just got to watch if he nods off during landing.  When Elo said hang in there, the first thought I had was that I was going to get a call from Lee Abrams.  Yeah.  How many fuel stops to Vegas in your plane?  Only one?  That's it?  You've got big tanks in that thing? 
[00:29:00]  Nice.  I thought I was going to get the call and I was going to have to do the Mile High Club with Lee Abrams.  We've got to make a stop in Miami first.  I've got to pick up some packages that wash ashore.  And then we're going to make another stop.  I've got to fly to Bogota, Colombia.  That's what I mean by the other Mile High Club with Lee Abrams.  Got to get him a hand job just to keep him awake.  He's been known to fall asleep at the wheel.  So we've heard anyway.  No, if the FAA is listening, he's fine.  Yeah, he's certainly fine. 
[00:29:30]  Don't worry.  Yeah, look at him.  Does he look fine to you?  Of course he does.  He looks like a narcoleptic junkie.  Man, I have a pilot's license.  Give him some respect.  Oh, man.  But we made it at CES.  I see you've got the PalTalk camera up.  Yeah, I'm a little angry.  The picture's really pixelated and grainy.  And it was fine right up until showtime.  Because I'm using Don Wickland's wonderful laptop here.  And he has a screensaver type thing that came on every five minutes, which completely ruined the feed. 
[00:30:00]  Yeah.  It's an annoying screensaver that is just, I don't know why anyone would want to have it.  It makes it look like your laptop's broken.  It gets staticky.  And...  Why'd you go in and change it?  I turned it off, but it was too late.  When I logged back on, it gave me this grainy, pixelated view of the show.  And that's who the people on PalTalk are enjoying now.  So do you have to start over?  Yeah, during a break, I'll reboot.  And I heard you had a Vegas cam outside your hotel room?  Vegas cam outside the hotel room all night so people could peer in and look at wonderful downtown Las Vegas. 
[00:30:30]  Again, now last year, the hotel we stayed at, they were doing construction on it.  And there was a construction elevator right out my window.  So every two minutes on the two minute, another load of cement was coming up the elevator.  And that was every two minutes for the entire stay.  This time, I'm facing the airport.  And it is like Saigon. 
[00:31:00]  It is like I'm sleeping in Saigon.  Helicopters...  Those helicopters are amazing.  ...are going over my room.  Every two minutes, another chopper is going over, dropping off troops.  I don't know what they're doing, but it is very loud.  Yeah.  Again, wonderful accommodations.  But you got the Vegas cam up.  Vegas cam is out the window.  And this pal talk with the Opie and Anthony fans is just taking off.  It's taking off.  There's multiple rooms now.  I mean, we're at the point now every room can fit about 300 people.  But we're going to be upgrading to, you know, thousands of people are going to be able to check in. 
[00:31:30]  There's, like I said, multiple rooms.  There's fan rooms that we're getting blamed for, for people getting thrown out.  There's like, let's say, Opie and Anthony fan room.  People go in there, and now people have moderation power to throw out whoever they want.  So they throw someone out.  And then I get emails going, dude, you know, I get thrown out of the room.  It's not our room.  They can do whatever the hell they want.  They've been throwing out people of Middle Eastern ethnicity just because their name is like Abu Halibaba.  Oh, boom, you're gone.  Goodbye. 
[00:32:00]  They're bound.  You have a dash in your name.  Out, motherfucker.  Gone.  Beat it.  But they're looking in on the show today.  I guess we've got to sort of behave, so we'll talk about what's really going on in those pal talk rooms when we get back to New York.  Oof.  It's just a whole society that's building.  Hardcore live sex.  Yeah, thank you to that couple that I was watching, by the way.  Appreciate that.  What happened, Jimmy?  Some girl and her boyfriend's like, my chick's a huge fan.  And so she's being naked for me, and she's got the cam aimed at her crotch, and she's, you know, it was just fantastic. 
[00:32:30]  And then he came over, and his meal wound up in her face, and you know what happens.  Oral treats.  Oh, it was lovely.  Just for you?  Right there on the camera.  Yeah, and his gut's hanging out.  He's wearing these awful boxer shorts.  It looked like me getting blown.  It was great.  Yeah, there are a couple of real good eggs in some of these O&A fan sites that just use hairbrushes.  One girl was, well, let's just say if she was a house, you'd be going through the back door. 
[00:33:00]  Ah.  Because maybe you got mud on your boots.  Ah, yes.  And you don't want to trail that through the front door.  Right.  Oh, all that was going on last night.  And then she decided to use it as a lollipop.  Ah, very nice.  That's a good egg.  Good egg for everybody.  Good egg.  All right.  Well, we're going to take our first break.  George Wallace is here.  Alice Cooper is here as well.  Wow, we got some real guests this year.  George Wallace and Alice Cooper.  That's quite a lineup.  And we also have Laszlo that wants to talk about all the technology that's happening here at CES, right? 
[00:33:30]  Laszlo's the recon guy, man.  He gets here.  He actually walks around, looks at all the technology, and lets us know what's going on.  I want to see how quick the guys are back in New York.  I want to play that SARS thing from Brother Joe.  Oh.  In honor of all the people we saw on the planes with the SARS mask.  The SARS mask.  It's all about the Asians in these casinos.  It's unbelievable.  They're taking over the world.  They're taking over Vegas.  Yes.  And Vegas, what a difference a year makes. 
[00:34:00]  They said they can't really build any further as far as out because they've reached the mountains.  Yeah.  So now it's all about just building condos everywhere.  Now they're just starting to build up.  Stacking it up.  They're starting to build up everywhere.  They're buying up every single lot in Vegas to get the condos and everything else going.  It's unbelievable.  All right.  We'll take a quick break.  I don't know if they got it.  If they do, that would be great.  It's Opie and Anthony and Jimmy Norton live from Las Vegas, Nevada at the CES.  And we'll continue with George Wallace.  See, I'm stretching here because I know they're panicking going through CDs right now. 
[00:34:30]  Where is it?  Back in New York.  Alice Cooper and Laszlo all on the way.  Sick with the SARS, I cough and I wheeze that incurable illness.  Thank the Chinese for SARS. 
[00:35:00]  Infected with SARS, I cough, I'm in vain.  I must have caught it from that chink on the plane with SARS.  Sickened by SARS, and it really shows. 
[00:35:30]  My right lung exploded and blew out of my nose.  It's SARS.  Chinese gave me SARS.  I am very sick.  Glad I'm not like them.  With their really small height and SARS.  Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.

[00:38:30]  That mortgage company said no to our refi.  We'll have to hold off payment on some bills, penalties, credit damage,  and we still need to pay our taxes.

[00:39:30]  So much going on.  We only have a two-hour show.  We could kind of do this in our sleep, I think.  This is the easiest way to broadcast.  We've done the four-hour show in our sleep.  Many times.  What's a two-hour?  Jimmy, a quick question off the phone lines.  How many whores have you had so far here in Vegas?  One.  One night, one whore.  That's the way it works. 
[00:40:00]  One for one.  Yeah.  Did you have somebody visit you last night?  I certainly did.  And are you familiar with the Vegas people,  so you don't have to worry,  or you just go down to the lobby?  Dude, I didn't even go on the computer.  I just dialed it for my cell phone.  Really?  Yeah, of course.  I got to punch it on my cell phone.  You got to love Jimmy, man.  Was it good?  Decent, not great.  Oh.  Well, it's got to be better than last year,  because last year he was quite sick.  Oh, yeah, I really was sick.  Do you remember that?  Yeah, I vomited.  You had some bad hamburgers?  That was her name, Hamburger.  Free BLTs? 
[00:40:30]  Free BLTs, and I threw up before our show.  No, no, no.  This was actually a mediocre at best.  I think I was like her 80th customer.  You never want to fight a whore after a convention.  Right.  You're basically just stirring the porridge at that point.  Oh, God.  It's like trying to fit it into a baby bird's eye.  It's like, ow, ow.  Well, you guys hear Laszlo.  He has joined the program.  Yes.  He's all about the CES stuff.  He knows the technology.  And the airport was such a mess yesterday.  Like, the cab line was an hour and a half, 
[00:41:00]  so I went to one of those shuttle bus services  where they put, like, 20 people on the bus.  Yeah.  And, you know, you wait forever,  and then we're clunking along.  This big, fat black guy is driving the bus,  and all of a sudden I hear this rumble at the front of the bus.  He just reaches down, grabs a can of Lysol,  and goes over his head.  I was horrified.  I was like, that guy just blew ass.  There's all these geeks on the bus just bugging.  That's exactly what he should have done,  all those boring conventioneers.  Probably, hey, we got a new chip this year.  Here, fuck you, take that.  Yeah, what are the geeks going to do in that situation? 
[00:41:30]  Nothing.  Absolutely nothing.  Sit there and breathe it in and watch them swat planes.  So, Laszlo, what do you got so far?  There are so many services this year  that want to try to replace your cable or your dish service.  Is that it, really?  Over the IP.  You know, so you basically subscribe to a TV service  over high-speed broadband,  and, you know, they're advertising, you know...  Wait, now, I know a lot of the cable companies  have high-speed broadband.  Right.  So you're saying now the high-speed broadband people 
[00:42:00]  are getting into the cable TV type business?  So it's basically just a service that delivers on-demand porn,  there's one called ITVN.  I brought that by your office,  and I believe the interns have been checking that out  back at the New York studios.  Nothing getting done over there.  But there's one called Dave TV that you subscribe,  you know, it's like 20 bucks a month,  and you get all these...  It's niche channels that you can get over broadband,  like the La Crosse channel,  because we all know how exciting 24-hour La Crosse is.  So if you want to watch La Crosse... 
[00:42:30]  Yeah, if you want to watch men swinging their bag  on the end of a stick...  Great.  Wonderful.  That's available to you.  Starz has got...  You know, Netflix, I think,  is going to really have some competition,  because instead of dealing with DVDs  and the whole return thing,  Starz has a service called Vongo,  V-O-N-G-O.  Yeah, I heard about this.  And you can download hundreds of movies  to the hard drive of your PC  and watch it on the road,  and it's 10 bucks a month.  So it's like Netflix,  except you don't...  Only without the mail.  Yeah, you don't have to deal with the DVDs. 
[00:43:00]  Well, it's about time.  And there's a lot of services  that want to, like,  deliver your media to you from afar.  Like, have you seen that Sling Media Box?  It's basically a device  that hooks to your home cable connection,  and on your laptop in Vegas,  you can be watching things  that are on your home TiVo.  You can be watching...  Oh, really?  ...your home cable channels on the road.  That's cool.  Because I know I have a service  where I could pop my...  And this has been out there a while, obviously.  You could pop... 
[00:43:30]  I could pop my desktop up at home  and work on my computer at home  from a laptop here in Vegas.  I could access anything.  And at home, in my dark house,  all of a sudden,  my computer, my screensaver will stop,  and the mouse will start going around my house,  my empty...  Like a ghost is using your computer at home.  Yeah, like a ghost is using the computer.  I got cameras in there.  I could just check in on my house  at any given moment.  I don't want to...  My girlfriend's mother is there,  so I really don't want to pop the camera off  and maybe get a very unpleasant surprise.  Two black gentlemen leaving. 
[00:44:00]  Counting money.  She's waving.  Come back soon.  Thank you.  She'll be wearing a robe.  You should have told her  that the cameras are on.  No, no, I'm not.  I didn't tell her about the cameras.  And then we could have broadcast it  on this huge screen behind us.  Walking around in her pajamas.  In her house coat.  Wiping boogers on your furniture.  Laszlo, what about the phones?  Everyone wants to know  what's going on with the phones.  These GPS phones.  I was checking out these new GPS phones, 
[00:44:30]  Nokia and the software.  And basically,  you can send a text message to your buddy  and say, you know,  here I am, come find me.  And on his GPS phone,  will pop up the exact coordinates  and guide him there.  And you could get a Yahoo type map  on there and it'll show  where that person is.  So if you're at a huge convention  and you're trying to find  that other person,  where are you?  You just send them a text message.  It sends the coordinates  and you've got a map 
[00:45:00]  and you just start walking.  Oh, that's really cool.  That's cool.  The Middle Eastern people  on a plane wouldn't even think  of using that  with their friends on the ground.  That's relaxing.  I'm in a cab.  It's missile friendly, too.  Why are we doing this shit?  This is stupid.  I'm in a cab last night  and this creepy cab driver is like,  you know a lot about the computers, yes?  And I go, yeah.  He goes,  I take my laptop to Internet Cafe  here in Vegas.  The NSA,  can they know that I am sending messages home?  And I'm like,  oh, great.  What kind of messages 
[00:45:30]  are you sending there, buddy?  You know you're legally obligated  to kill him right then at that point  as an American?  Yeah, that's part of the Patriot Act.  Yeah, the Patriot Act.  You can then choke him.  Beat him to death  with his own laptop.  I was like,  you know,  if you're a sleeper cell,  you may not want to be just asking  random people in the back of the cab.  My friend, my friend.  All right, Laz,  we'll stay right there.  We've got to get George Wallace  on the show.  We're backing up already.  Already.  Already.  George Wallace was a lot of fun  last year when we were at CES.  And here he comes.  Look at this guy. 
[00:46:00]  Jesus Christ.  Yeah.  George Wallace, everyone.  George.  We've got a nice live audience,  by the way, here.  Yes, we do.  In Vegas.  What's up, George?  We got George on last year.  Yes, we did.  And I was asking George,  I haven't seen him  in the neighborhood lately,  because last year we talked about,  we talked to you  and you said you were going  to be in Vegas  for like a month,  month and a half.  For 30 days, 30 days.  I came here,  got popular,  and now I'm here for two years.  How about that?  The people of Las Vegas  let me stay in the community  and we're just selling out  every night  and we're just doing well.  We're happy to be in Las Vegas  and welcome to Las Vegas, 
[00:46:30]  everybody out here.  Welcome to Las Vegas.  A two-year contract, huh?  No, it's as long as I want, actually.  Now it's as long as you want?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  And you don't get...  I make a flamingo  every night at 10 o'clock.  Voted the best show  at 10 o'clock.  The best show at 10 o'clock.  Yes, 10 p.m.  The best 10 p.m. show.  Who voted?  I got to ask you something  because we talked...  I voted.  I voted.  I'm the only one that voted.  I made that happen.  Are there other 10 p.m. shows?  There's a lot of them.  There's a thousand of them,  but mine is different.  The best 11-14 show?  Yeah, right.  That involves a magician.  Are you gambling? 
[00:47:00]  Because last year we talked...  Are you crazy?  Well, last year we asked you,  you said,  no way I stay away from the gambling.  I'm just thinking  you might have got the bug  because it's been a year.  I never got the bug.  You cannot win here.  I told you before,  if you want to double your money  in Las Vegas,  mug somebody at the airport,  get your ass on an airplane  where you're going to  double your money again.  How about that?  How about that?  I got my ass handed to me  playing three-card last night.  Did you?  A lot of people asking  how we did gambling.  And I talked Keith  into playing three-card.  I'm like,  it's a fun game.  You don't lose too bad.  We got our asses handed to us. 
[00:47:30]  Three-card poker,  you could get hammered.  We were in a massive losing streak.  Both of us.  Nothing.  Nothing going on.  Then a guy sits next to me.  He's playing $500 a hand  and he hit for $3,000.  Oh, that's nice.  Hit six to one on a $500.  I won $1,300 this morning.  This morning?  On Google.  You bought some Google?  I swear,  I had January call options  that I bought in a while 
[00:48:00]  because you can't buy Google now.  Forget it.  It's like $440.  It's way up there.  So you can't buy actual shares.  What you can do  is buy options  for like $14 a clip.  So I got in  like $13 and change.  I punched out  at $20.  It was a $20-something yesterday.  And I made a quick  $1,300  playing the old stock market  here in Vegas.  Listen to this guy. 
[00:48:30]  That's all I do.  The Dow Jones was up yesterday, right?  Yeah, it did pretty good.  You know what that means  to people like me and you, right?  Why?  Not a damn thing.  What is this?  I don't even know  who Dow Jones is.  We gave up on the stock market.  Well, I did.  I lost so much money back.  You know,  President Clinton was in office.  I was rich then.  Now I'm back here  in Vegas telling jokes.  Well, you've got to get back in.  There are some  money-making opportunities.  I'm scared to get back in.  I need to do that.  It's a little frightening.  Absolutely.  I'll be hitting  the three-card poker tables  tonight.  Three-card over Blackjack? 
[00:49:00]  And then I'll do  a little hold'em.  I saw the hold'em tables  taking over the casino.  Yeah.  The whole area  is getting bigger and bigger.  Bigger and bigger, right?  Yeah.  It's all about the hold'em, George.  And the kids are playing  in a college now,  so it's a big thing, man.  Playing online.  Online, yeah.  You see those stories  about kids are funding  their college education  by gambling online.  Playing online poker.  I won $30 at the machine  and I went upstairs  like an old lady.  I was fucking  won $30.  I printed it out  and I went upstairs  down the line down.  You get like $2.50.  The cardboard tub  with the quarters in it.  Did you buy yourself 
[00:49:30]  a new dress?  You're a real player.  A real player.  You know how I gamble  in Vegas?  No condom.  That is a gamble, my friend.  How do you know  what you're getting  when you order  a hooker in Vegas?  Do you have those  glossy things,  the magazines  they pass out on the street corners?  No, I already know her,  so I go online  and I investigate.  The same way you do  with technology,  believe me.  You can order them online  though, can't you?  You can follow up,  they'll be up to your room  in like 30 minutes.  Just like a domino pizza.  If they don't arrive  in 30 minutes, 
[00:50:00]  it's free.  Yeah,  probably wouldn't want to pay.  There's pepperonis  all on the ass cheeks.  Something that looks like them.  Big pepperoni.  That's just a cold sore daddy.  All right,  thank you.  Getting a few groans  on that one.  That's very funny.  He's a pro though.  So that business  is in town.  Are you here  for the porn convention?  No,  I'm here with these guys  and I am actually doing  something for the porn convention,  yes.  Yeah,  you talked about that yesterday.  I discussed that 
[00:50:30]  with you a little bit.  You're involved this year  with the porn convention again?  Possibly presenting an award.  Presenting an award.  now,  best actor,  best actress,  best supporting,  best special effects.  What category?  Best log.  Probably best,  I think it's best anal  and best ethnic  theme series Asian.  Those are the ones,  yeah,  best anal sex  and the best ethnic  theme series Asian.  I could have sworn  George Clooney  was presenting that one.  But no,  it's our own  little Jimmy Norton.  Congratulations on that.  I'm not exactly  presenting the award,  I actually just 
[00:51:00]  wiped their dicks off  after the scene is shot.  Sounds like you're  into this too.  Totally.  He knows them all  by name,  he just,  these guys rattle off  porn stars like  they're rattling off  Hollywood A-listers.  Yeah,  like baseball players,  they know all their stats.  And they look at you  when you don't know  the name like,  what's wrong with you?  What's the matter with you?  How do you not know  this one?  Amazing.  Steve,  you're going with Jimmy?  Not to the award,  no.  Oh,  not this year?  He has to fly back  in the middle seat. 
[00:51:30]  That's got to be a treat  for the guy at the window.  Climbing out over Steve.  Excuse me,  pardon me.  Big fucking  biker arm creep  settling down  with a good book  and some fucking  ass-eating videos.  Sorry,  we're live here  in front of the people.  Don't curse as much.  Don't curse as much, right?  Well,  we're trying to do  a cleaner version  of our show  for the people.  Well,  we're trying to.  For the live audience.  For the live audience.  They don't care. 
[00:52:00]  They're dregs.  That's right.  The dregs of society.  That's right.  We're just playing  the game for two days.  That's it.  Listening to the man,  man.  It's all about the technology.  Do you have  any technology, George?  What's your favorite gadget?  I don't know anything.  I just know how to turn my camera.  I just get my mail,  my email,  and that's all I know  how to do.  I want to learn  about this stuff, though.  I hear it's just crazy  here with Bill Gates  and everything.  It's crazy here.  I like to come down  and see what's new.  I might get a camera.  A camera?  A digital camera?  Do you have a digital camera?  I don't have anything, man.  I don't know  how to do anything, man.  You're putting in the film? 
[00:52:30]  I have a brownie.  You got the Instamatic  with the flash cube.  A brownie.  You don't even...  Well, that's true.  George has to have some guy  hold up some gunpowder  and poof.  That's how old I am.  But I want to learn  about these new gadgets.  I got the radio in my car.  I have you in my car.  You got the XR?  See?  That's good.  That's the only technology  we really care about,  isn't it?  Some of the digital camera companies  now are going after  the video iPod.  I checked out one last night  that they're basically saying  a digital camera  could play movies. 
[00:53:00]  Yeah, that's what  they're saying, yeah.  Because why buy  a video iPod  when a digital camera  could also...  You could also watch movies.  You could also watch movies  and take movies  if you want to record them.  If you want to...  Well, they're all  getting aggressive.  They all want to converge now.  Yeah.  Everyone is just like...  Everyone wants  the one device.  Yeah.  The one thing  that does it all.  There's a digital camera  that gets TV signals.  Really?  Yeah.  All right, that's kind of cool.  That's kind of like  the telephone, though.  That's the same thing  you can watch television  on the telephone now.  Yeah.  That's pretty cool.  And every year  at these conventions 
[00:53:30]  somebody has a video phone.  You know, like,  oh, this is great.  You can see the person  you're talking to.  Yeah.  But nobody wants  to be seen, you know?  I do, but I'm just afraid.  No, because you do  creepy things  when you're on the phone.  That's exactly right.  You pick your nose,  you touch yourself, you know?  You touch yourself.  I cannot talk on the phone  at home by myself  without one hand on the phone  and one hand on the horn.  I cannot do that at home.  Do you?  I cannot...  I cannot...  You're at home by yourself  and your hand  just automatically  goes down in your pants.  You can walk down,  walk around the house  with your hand down in your pants  talking on the phone.  I don't need my grandmother 
[00:54:00]  to see that.  Is that why you want  to know what I'm wearing?  Oh, wait a second.  I'm the only one  that do that?  Yeah, I don't think  anybody else feels...  You guys don't play  with yourself  when you're talking  about the phone?  Not on the phone.  Yeah, always.  Jimmy, probably.  Thank you so much.  I'm glad I'm not the only one.  No, always.  You know what the thing  is about the video phone also?  You don't want to be...  You don't want to let anyone know  during those times  where you're naked  and you're talking.  You got out of the shower,  you're getting dressed  in the morning.  There have been times  you've talked to close friends  completely naked on the phone 
[00:54:30]  and you just don't want  that image conjured up  live on video.  You don't want to even  acknowledge it on the phone.  Hey, I'm nude right now, Opie.  It's bad how you're doing.  What about the show today?  What do we...  He'll never get over that.  You know, bad enough  when you're talking  to somebody on the phone  and you hear the toilet flush  and you're like...  You were just taking a dump.  Yeah.  You're just on the...  I do that all the time.  I do that all the time.  I am just flushing.  Why not?  No.  You've just got to be  in a suit and tie  like the Cleavers  You two are the weirdest  guys in America  and hear you saying  things you wouldn't do 
[00:55:00]  like that.  You don't walk around  naked?  Not naked on the phone.  No.  I don't want to know  like Steve C.  is naked talking to me  about something.  He's probably never naked.  He's such a creep.  He's probably always  got a t-shirt on.  He's just nude  below the waist  with a long flaming shirt,  a pair of high socks,  no underwear,  and a fucking awful shirt.  Steve, don't take that  from this guy, man.  Nude with a pair  of black dress socks.  Steve, get on.  Get on mic there.  Yeah, put him on mic here.  You take this mic here,  young man. 
[00:55:30]  There's our pal Steve.  Made it.  Yeah, there we go.  You got a direct flight  in with Ben, too, didn't you?  Yeah, Ben and I  were on a direct flight.  That must have been  fun flying with Ben.  Yeah.  Well, no, he was about  six rows behind me,  but we were surrounded  by Arabs.  Wow.  Yeah.  You had the Arabian flight.  We had the Arabian flight.  They were all reading.  Were they all looking  at you suspiciously?  Oh, surprisingly,  I fit in.  You fit in, you Lebanese.  Yeah.  They all looked like Ben,  like he had a time bomb on him  that was ticking too loudly. 
[00:56:00]  But they were short-circuiting  and sending an electric charge  through his body.  That dark.  So what was Ben doing  besides eating airplane bottles  full of alcohol?  Ben won't even open them  to drink and he just  swallows them whole  and waits until they digest.  The plane was so crowded,  I don't think Ben slept much.  His plan was to just  pass out on the plane  and sleep in the air.  Pass out is a good plan for Ben.  Yeah, any time there's travel,  that's Ben's plan.  All right, we're going to  take a ride to Starbucks.  He's got to,  let me have a drink  and I'll pass out.  He wanted to start drinking 
[00:56:30]  at Newark Airport  and I was like,  Ben, it's 7.30.  Let's go get bloodies.  Nothing better than  flying with Ben.  You will find a bar,  you'll get Bloody Mary's.  Yeah.  Yeah, it's a lot of fun.  Ben is fun to fly with.  He is, he's very fun.  But just,  I didn't want to start drinking  at 7 o'clock in the morning.  Yeah, there's some flights  you just don't start at that.  Yeah.  His liver is actually  a frequent flyer.  So you guys have been  doing all this flying.  You did see the game last night.  I assume you did see  the game last night.  I saw the last few plays there,  George.  You did not see that game  last night?  It took me 16 hours  to get to Vegas.  I missed a lot yesterday. 
[00:57:00]  16 hours?  Where did you come from?  New York.  16 hours?  Did you drive?  We already,  we already went through this.  We already explained it.  One of my tickets got canceled  and I had to be rerouted  through L.A.  Oh, I'm so sorry.  I feel so sorry for you.  16 hours.  But that was the greatest game  I've ever seen.  It was amazing.  Did he win any money?  I don't gamble.  You can't win money.  We've got to at least  gamble on sports.  Wow.  You don't even gamble  on sports?  I don't gamble on anything  because whatever I,  you know, 
[00:57:30]  you want to win some money?  Let me gamble  and then you bet against me.  You'll definitely win.  It's just like me  in the stock market.  Whatever going down,  I had Delta.  I had Delta.  You had,  what did you have?  Google.  I had Delta.  I got General Motors.  Everything that's going down,  I got it.  That's why I got to work  in Vegas for the next few years.  I'm having fun  working here in Vegas.  So I'm telling you guys,  if you have nothing to do,  stop by.  You never know  who's going to stop in.  Where are you at again?  Give the big plug.  I'm at the Flamingo  at 10 p.m. last weekend.  We had Jerry Seinfeld  walk out on the stage  and just going in 
[00:58:00]  and it's crazy.  And he came to see  what a real comedian does.  You know,  I had to teach him  many days.  You guys go way back.  Oh, 30 years.  This year's our 30 years.  I've been my best friend  for 30 years.  Can you believe that?  What is the best thing  he's done for you?  He's done a damn thing  for me.  That's what I'm thinking.  That's what I'm thinking.  That's what I'm thinking.  He's been my friend.  He's a nice guy.  I wish we had a friend  like Jerry Seinfeld.  So nice guy.  He never took you on a...  If you're going to pick a thing,  you might as well  pick one with $500 million, right?  Yeah.  He never gave you a car  or took you on a crazy vacation  with the guys?  Nothing?  We've done everything 
[00:58:30]  I need.  Yeah, we've done a lot.  You know what?  We've done a lot together.  We just, like three months ago,  we just up  and went to Zurich, Switzerland  for lunch.  How about that?  He has the jet.  We jump on the jet.  We went to Zurich, Switzerland  for lunch.  We do stuff like that.  Yeah, how about that?  Wow.  Why couldn't you get  the Seinfeld jet  to take you to Vegas?  Seven hour flight for lunch?  Yeah, we went there for lunch.  We stayed overnight  and we just had a good time.  We do things like that.  We do a lot.  That's so cool.  He's got some money  and some accounts.  You know what he did for me?  Yeah.  He let me hold his baby  during the bris,  you know,  for the circumcision.  For the circumcision. 
[00:59:00]  Yeah, to cut the thing off,  you know.  And to this day,  the little boy looks at me  when I walk in the room  and he looks like,  I know that man  from somewhere,  you know.  That's not a good memory.  I would gather  that's a good memory.  That's not a great memory at all.  What a good thing  for a friend to do.  Thank you for the foreskin.  Could you throw that out?  So that's a big honor.  He's a nice guy.  He's done everything  a friend could do.  You could ask a friend to do.  Anything I need,  you know,  I bought a house  up on Central Park West  and I don't know  whether I have enough money.  So you've got money,  we've got money.  Not that I need it,  you know,  that's what a good friend is.  That is cool.  He helped you buy a place? 
[00:59:30]  He didn't help me buy a place.  I'm just telling you,  he just said,  we have money.  George has his own money.  Thank you so much.  I work every day.  I'm not like you,  working at the porno.  Well, you make more money  than I do, don't you?  I do okay,  but I'm just relating  your fantastic friend  to the fucking creeps  that I associate with.  True.  You've got to agree with it.  Look at these guys  are loaded here.  Look at them in New Yorkers.  They don't look loaded,  but they are.  I know they are.  Jimmy's got a very different story  hanging out with his friends.  Yeah.  Than you have, George.  Let's go to Zurich, Switzerland.  I can't get these fucking chiselers  to take me to the Brooklyn Diner. 
[01:00:00]  You won't take them  to the Brooklyn Diner?  What is wrong with you guys?  Is that what it costs there?  Jesus.  Hey, go there  and have the breakfast there.  It's called the cinnamon toast.  The toast,  it is so good.  Have that for breakfast.  Yeah, $38 for cinnamon toast.  It went up $2, $40.  I had a chicken pot pie there once.  It was like $50.  You had that chicken pot pie?  It's delicious.  It is good.  But it's $50.  Yeah, but you want to fuck it  before you eat it.  That ain't bad.  Do you ever try that?  Well, for that kind of money, yeah.  All right, we're going to take a break. 
[01:00:30]  We've got to say thanks to George Wallace.  Well, thank you so much  for having me stop by.  It's always a pleasure  to see you two guys.  I want to stop in the New York  and say hello to you sometime.  But if you come to Las Vegas,  you know who I am.  Where?  At the Flamingo.  10 p.m. every night.  Best 10 p.m. show in Las Vegas.  Not too early, not too late.  All right.  Thank you, George.  God bless you.  Something good is going to happen to you.

[01:07:00]  We're back with the program live from Las Vegas, Nevada at CES.  We have Laszlo sitting in.  We've got Alice Cooper that's going to be on stage in a few minutes here.  Laszlo, anything else real fast before we go to Mr. Cooper? 
[01:07:30]  I was checking out those heads-up displays, you know.  They seem to think every year at these shows that people are going to walk around and surf the Internet at the same time.  Oh, this is that thing that's like a heads-up display.  It's a headset that you put on, and in the glasses, you see your desktop.  So you can, what kind of interface is it? How do you work a mouse?  Some of them have gloves. Some of them have like a pad that you wear on your belt, and you sort of use that as a touchpad. 
[01:08:00]  Yeah.  But this one I was checking out last night actually projects a laser on your retina and draws your desktop.  Oh, that's healthy.  Yeah.  I'm sure that laser on your retina all day long.  I also checked out an XM radio that was enormous.  It was like a bread box.  This company came out with it because it received shortwave.  Oh, I've seen that one. Advertised. Yeah, it's got like shortwave, XM, and...  AM and FM.  Some kind of NASA band.  I don't know what made them decide on that, but... 
[01:08:30]  Do you ever listen to shortwave?  No.  Maybe some nice German programming?  That is so far into geekdom that even I don't go there.  Yeah, what's the silliest thing you've seen here so far, Laszlo?  Something where you're like, what were they thinking?  One of the things that I don't understand is why is there no mobile phone that gets satellite radio?  That's got to be coming soon.  Tick-tock.  Tick-tock.  Tick-tock.  Sirius is working on it with a rotary. 
[01:09:00]  Where you actually have to dial?  By the way, this crowd that's gathered, they're loving this Sirius abuse that Jimmy's pounding away.  Stink.  So easy.  Jimmy couldn't get enough of this new...  Which one did you have?  The Pioneer or the Samsung?  They're both great, but I was the one I got...  I just grabbed the Pioneer as the one I was listening to yesterday.  I was listening to actually a replay of the show.  Jimmy.  It was unbelievable.  It was unbelievable.  It was unbelievable.  It was unbelievable.  Yeah, just take it.  What are they going to do? 
[01:09:30]  What are they going to do?  Nothing.  What are they going to do if I shove that in the bag and just leave it?  Nothing.  I'm taking this one.  One of the weirdest things that you're asking, like, bizarre, stupid things?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  This came up a few years ago, and they're trying it again.  It's a device that you plug into your computer, and based on what websites you go to or movies you watch, smells will be emitted.  Ah, the whole smell-o-vision again?  The smell-o-vision, who cares?  Yeah, the device is like 800 bucks. 
[01:10:00]  Some of this technology they've just got to give up on for forever.  Enough with the smell-o-vision.  You know, and the guy's like, oh, you know, if you're playing a video game and you peel out in the car, maybe you smell burning rubber.  That's great.  Or if Jimmy's surfing.  Yeah, God knows.  You go on Ben's computer, it smells like Jim Cook just burped in your face.  We should get Alice Cooper here.  Ben's freaking out speaking here, Ben.  Yeah, we can't make Alice Cooper wait.  Ben is bouncing up and down over there, off the stage. 
[01:10:30]  You know, Sony's also got this e-reader.  They keep pushing this e-books thing.  Right.  Like, that's going to take off.  Like a, uh, it's, it's, what, a screen?  Yeah.  Kind of a flat screen thing that you read like a book.  And you download books, and the books are the same price as the paper version.  Why not just get the paper version?  Or, if you want to read, get something for your regular laptop.  And the reader's like 300, 400 bucks.  For that price, you could buy like, you know, two dozen books on Amazon.  Look who has joined us.  Alice Cooper.  Hi, kids.  Alice Cooper. 
[01:11:00]  Hi, I'm getting in a car.  Live audience, well, you know.  I like that, Alice.  Rock and roll.  So, uh, welcome to CES.  Thank you.  Do you do the technology thing?  No.  We have George Wallace here, and he does nothing.  I do nothing.  You have, you don't have a fancy cell phone?  I have on, off, volume, that's it.  You don't have some kind of a, uh, GPS range finder for your ball when you're golfing?  I wish.  Now, see, that would be a good idea.  See?  They have those things.  I am the lowest tech guy you've ever seen in your life.  Really?  Yeah, I just honestly.  Does it just scare you, or you just don't care? 
[01:11:30]  No, I just don't care.  Honestly, I don't want people to know where I'm at.  You know, I mean, everybody's got their phone on.  I have a phone.  Yeah.  I turn it on when I want to call somebody.  That's it.  Okay, if they invented the phone after email, wouldn't it have been more logical?  Because think of it.  Email, you've got to type it in, you've got to send it, and everything like that.  Some guy comes up and says, look, you press these buttons and you can talk to the person. 
[01:12:00]  Get out of here!  Like we had a phone.  No way!  So we actually went backwards with email.  That's a good point.  Wouldn't you rather talk to somebody?  But the good thing is that you don't have to talk.  That's the beauty of email.  It's like the chick that, you know, freaking blew you two weeks ago.  You can email her at three in the morning and go, just thinking of it when you're really not.  Well, for one thing, right, you can't pick up attitude in an email.  We've got a lot more done just sending the quick messages, though.  We all have the BlackBerrys, and instead of making a five or ten minute phone call, it's a quick email. 
[01:12:30]  For business, it makes sense.  Right.  But I think it's socially suicide.  What about music-wise?  You step into technology as far as that goes, or you're still reel-to-reel in it?  I, you know, music.  I don't know.  I'm so in music that I'd probably try to get away from it.  Yeah.  I do everything I can not to worry about the idea.  But you know what?  I'm very selective, though.  I'll go in and I'll find, oh, man, Paul Butterfield.  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  You know, or a lot of great new bands out there.  There's a lot of great garage bands that are just now becoming garage bands that are picking up on early 60s stuff. 
[01:13:00]  And they're great.  I mean, really good garage bands.  And I love that I'm now Alice Copper.  Oh, they had me as Steve Laszlo right there.  I love that.  That's hilarious.  Who is running?  I'm Alice Copper.  We've got a huge screen behind our broadcast, and it says Alice Copper.  They renamed me.  Wow.  Alice Copper.  Somebody right now should feel like a real asshole.  No, I like it.  See, no, that's great.  I wouldn't even have noticed that.  Alice Copper. 
[01:13:30]  I looked at it, and I kept going like this.  That can't be right.  Yeah.  We had a boomer Platinum on earlier.  It was a great guest earlier for us.  You know something?  Alice was there the day I met Groucho Marx.  Whoa.  Now, now.  A lot of connections on the show today.  They've been ragging me for years about this whole thing, that I actually met Groucho Marx.  Groucho was the coolest guy.  They asked me, you know, they think I'm a vampire, that I'm like 800 years old. 
[01:14:00]  I met Alice when I was a kid.  I met you, and I met Groucho when I was a kid.  Same day?  Same day.  It was at the same event.  It was something called...  It was called A Day at the Races.  Yes.  Many years ago, in the 70s.  That's right.  I did a song with Groucho.  I did, we did...  It wasn't 18, was it?  No, no, no.  We did...  I'm 100, and I like it.  It was a tattooed lady.  It sounded like it was a big tattooed lady.  It was one of the old Marx Brothers bits. 
[01:14:30]  Yep, yep.  You know.  See, he was an insomniac, and he used to call me up, and he says,  Alice, I can't sleep.  Come on over.  And we'd watch movies all night.  We'd sit there, and he'd be in bed with his beret on and his cigar,  and he'd be watching old movies, you know, and he'd say,  See that guy there?  Yeah, he's gay.  Wow, really?  Give me a little inside scoop.  But that's a cowboy.  You know, he's gay.  We do the same thing every time Steve walks in the room.  But it was great, though.  You would sit there, and you'd watch it, and you'd say, 
[01:15:00]  See her?  Yeah.  Harpo and Chico both got her one night.  He's telling all these stories about all these people,  and then I'd look over after a while,  and he'd be asleep.  Put a cigar out, and I'd leave.  Next, 2 o'clock in the morning, next morning,  Alice, can't sleep.  Come on over.  So I had a really good relationship with Groucho.  Wow, I didn't know you were that close with Groucho.  We were about a mile.  Oh, no, I was at his house almost every night.  But how did you befriend someone like Groucho Marx?  How did that start?  Groucho saw our show as being vaudeville.  See, he looked at it. 
[01:15:30]  You know, it was rock and roll and everything.  Yeah, yeah.  He would bring George Burns.  One night, he brought George Burns, Mae West, Jack Benny.  Fred Astaire showed up one night, because it was a big production.  The Welcome to My Nightmare show was like a vaudeville production.  And they said, that's vaudeville.  Wow.  I saw that in 1923.  Gracie was, you know, that whole thing.  One time I was going to chop Gracie's head off in a guillotine.  He's ripping me off.  I'm telling you the truth. 
[01:16:00]  Yeah, the snake, Bob the Snake guy.  Remember that?  1921.  You know, nothing that I did was new to these guys.  They had seen it all.  So, you know, they liked it because it was vaudeville.  That's interesting.  Everybody else saw it as being some avant-garde theater.  Yeah.  Wow, that is something.  They were closer than anybody was to it.  What do you think of the old rock and roll these days?  Well, you know, the band's the funny.  Hey, they spelled my name right.  There it is.  Yeah, Al.  That's great. 
[01:16:30]  You're spilling over Laszlo now.  Yeah, I'm sorry about that.  That's fine.  At least I'm not Steve Laszlo.  Yeah, he was Steve Laszlo before.  I go, where did you get this?  He's like, oh, on the internet.  Ah, good.  You could have walked over 10 feet and asked me.  See?  The impersonalization.  He's over there, googly.  Go talk to the guy.  Walk 10 feet.  Well, you know, the thing about if you go and see, I just saw, in one week, I saw McCartney  and his band and the Stones.  Now, I saw, you know, these same bands 35 years ago. 
[01:17:00]  McCartney was better now than he was then.  His band was unbelievable.  And the Stones were gloriously sloppy.  And they were great.  I mean, you know.  I saw the Stones over the summer.  I thought they were great.  I was going as a goof.  I haven't seen the Stones since Steel Wheels, which is, I don't know, 88?  Their farewell tour?  Yeah, 88 or 89.  And I went as a goof and I couldn't believe that they're still pulling it off like that.  Keith Richards, modern day medical miracle.  Yeah.  With his alien body.  I mean, you know. 
[01:17:30]  He was funny.  He says, great to be here in Phoenix.  You know, he says, it's great to be anywhere.  Yeah, yeah.  It is for him.  How do you feel about Sabbath finally getting into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame?  Well, it's about time.  Oh, wait a minute.  I'm not in the Hall of Fame.  The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame stinks.  Oh, wait a minute.  Let me see.  Oh, I'm overqualified, I guess.  Now, what?  Wait a minute.  The Talking Heads?  Yeah.  The Ramones?  Alice Cooper's not in the Hall of Fame.  You don't like the Ramones?  No, I must have stepped on somebody's cat or something. 
[01:18:00]  I don't know.  What's the Talking Heads big song?  I don't know.  Exactly.  No one cares about it.  How about the Pretenders?  How about the Pretenders?  I like the Pretenders, but.  I had a few, but I mean, Alice Cooper obviously should be in that.  No, there's something.  I did something really bad to these guys.  Whoever is doing it.  They're just a bunch of too hip for the room shitheads, and they finally put Sabbath in.  But even that said, they're still going to be awful, but with one great band.  Well, the funny thing is, is I would actually, it's more rock and roll to be thrown out of the Hall of Fame.  So, I mean, if we could be there.  I want to get in, and then they'd be like, get out of here. 
[01:18:30]  I'm going to have to be thrown out.  Very good.  Are you working on anything?  Recording anything?  Just finished 100 Cities.  We went out.  Cheap Trickle with us, opening up for us, and everything.  It was great.  And then we did England with Twisted Sister.  Now, that was a fun show.  Twisted Sister and Alice Cooper.  Good old Dee.  Oh, Dee was great.  You know, you can never get used to Dee, okay?  You know what he looks like, right?  Oh, yeah.  He's 19 feet tall with shoulder pads on and blonde hair.  And I turned the corner. 
[01:19:00]  They were coming off stage, and we were getting ready to go on.  And I turned the corner, and there he was.  You know, you can't.  He's got all this lipstick.  He does have a presence when he's in his garb.  That's for sure.  Hey, Alice, how you doing?  All you guys, man, over in Europe and stuff, you just kill over there, right?  We're getting ready to do Germany with Deep Purple.  Deep Purple.  That's going to be a huge show.  Deep Purple packs gigs out.  No, they're huge.  Yeah, massive.  We'll be doing Germany.  We'll be doing 20,000, 25,000 people.  What is the mindset there?  Like, why is that? 
[01:19:30]  Well, go to a mall.  Go to a mall, any mall, and look at three kids walking down the mall, and look at their T-shirts.  It's Black Sabbath, ACDC, the more demented ones are Alice Cooper, you know, Pink Floyd.  Hardly any kids wear new band T-shirts.  They wear all classic rock T-shirts.  That is something.  Because new bands rock and roll, it's not as honest as it used to be.  They've just become a bunch of, like, pompous, preachy, fucking socially conscious idiots.  It's like years ago, it was like guys puking and causing a rock and shit thrown at a hotel. 
[01:20:00]  Give me Joe Cocker.  Does three songs pukes?  Does three songs pukes?  Eh, nice rock and roll.  I interviewed him at BAB.  He walked in with a six-pack and no shoes.  I'm like, that's rock and roll.  No, he is.  I swear to God, no shoes.  Completely barefooted and just walked in.  He is.  Offered me a beer, and off we went.  He is.  He's the best.  Joe is the best.  And we were at OzFest a couple years back, and these guys look so tough on stage, and  then we're backstage, and they're eating vegetarian meals.  Yeah.  They're drinking their spring water. 
[01:20:30]  Oh, I love this.  What is missing here?  When you go to Norway, you know, there's the death metal bands, and it's like everybody's  trying to be more evil than the other band, you know?  And these guys ate their lead singer or something, you know, and they really did eat their lead  singer.  What?  They're all in jail.  Now they have all kind of credibility, of course.  Well, if that'll do it.  Because they ate their lead singer.  How did that happen?  The guy died.  They kill him, or did he die?  He died.  It would have been better if they would have killed him.  But he died. 
[01:21:00]  I guess then, instead of parrying him, they ate him.  To get his essence in them.  Well, they win.  We are the most evil of all.  They win.  So anyway.  The drummer had to eat his ass.  So in the end, in the end, the magazines are the best because we're more evil than you.  You know, we ate our drummer.  You know.  You see these guys backstage, and they're, you know, really horrific.  And it's like, hello, how are you?  Good to see you.  This is my mother. 
[01:21:30]  This is my sister.  This is my children.  You know, just like you said, is there any vegetarian?  They don't live it at all.  You know, they're not living that.  Yeah.  I couldn't wait to get out of the backstage area at OzFest.  I'm like, this is such a, this, it's, it's not real.  Nah.  Well, one thing, the one thing that, especially young bands, are really stupid about, is you  take a young band that's got a hit, and they're out there.  But they know what percentage of the t-shirts they're making, and they argue about it.  Wow. 
[01:22:00]  7.3, he's getting 7.9.  I still have no idea what I make a show.  You just want to, and you just want to get out there and rock.  Yeah.  Especially back in the, in the days, it was like, you just, you just want to get up on  stage.  You know what?  To this day, I have no idea what I make a night.  That's not smart if your business manager is listening.  I've had the same for a little.  Well, 38 years, Shep Gordon, I've been with 38 years.  We don't have a contract.  We don't have anything.  And it's always been, you take care of the business, I'll take care of the rock and roll.  And, believe me, 38 years of bliss. 
[01:22:30]  Yeah.  You want to go up to the bank tomorrow and realize he's worth $8,000?  I don't think you finish.  He does live in Maui.  I don't think you finish the story, so how did they eat?  The copper fortune is gone.  How did they eat the lead singer?  Yeah, back to the cannibalism.  And then, actually, instead of burying him, they went to the funeral home and got him.  They cooked him up.  Wow.  Snuck him up.  And then they got, of course, they got arrested.  Yeah, I would say.  Put in jail.  Wow.  And, but, great PR.  Can we all agree never to do that with each other? 
[01:23:00]  Yeah.  Unless I'm in court, he loves that.  Let's make a pat.  I bet you their music sucks.  If you've got to do that, your music's got to suck.  Ben's giving all kinds of hand signals.  I have no idea.  Did you see him?  I don't know.  Either we've got to take a break.  Or you need to steal third.  Yeah.  There's something going on.  I have no idea.  I guess we'll find out.  Yeah, he's pointing to his nose and his wallet.  What does that mean?  He's sweating alcohol today.  Anyone else notice that?  He's sweating alcohol.  Unbelievable. 
[01:23:30]  How's the handicap before he lets you go there, Alex?  I just played the Mercedes, first tournament of the year, Mercedes, with Sergio Garcia.  And, you know, still people look at me and they go, come on, it's Alice Cooper.  The guy with the snakes and all this.  A lot of people don't realize Alice is a golfer, man.  I shot 73.  Thank you.  73.  Is that good?  Yeah, that's really good.  That seems kind of low, though.  That's really good.  What's the handicap?  I'm four handicapped.  Four.  But I shot to one handicap that day.  Wow. 
[01:24:00]  It's so great, though.  I can hustle.  It used to be I could hustle anybody.  Now, they kind of do that.  Yeah.  I got it so made.  Now, you know, I'm a marked man.  We did an interview with you once when we were on AAF up in Boston.  You came over and you had just finished playing.  You were in golf attire with, like, some grass on your shoulder.  We're like, bring us Alice Cooper.  Who is this guy?  No, I'll tell you what.  Alice Cooper and golf never meet.  That's the good thing.  Yeah.  You know, because if you put golf clubs on my stage when I'm Alice, they would be weapons. 
[01:24:30]  I would look at them as, oh, weapons.  You know, because Alice has never played golf.  Of course not.  I mean, I don't involve him with golf.  And you don't paint up your eyes when you hit the links.  You know, if I were on the seniors tour, I would.  Yeah.  So I would think, what a great idea.  You go out there and all black.  If you could finish in the middle of the pack, absolutely.  You know, if you finish last, then it's not good.  That looks bad, yeah.  If you've got leopard skin hair and you get 20 rebounds, then you can have leopard skin hair. 
[01:25:00]  You know.  But, yeah, yeah, you know.  But if you finish in the middle of the pack, I would definitely go all off.  I mean, the Alice Cooper thing would be all over that golf course.  There's something to say.  Does Ozzy play golf?  Please tell me, though.  No.  That would shatter me.  No, no, no, no, no.  That's going to be like finding out that Duke is gay.  Ozzy, no, I don't think Ozzy, even though he's a British gentleman, he should play golf.  Certain guys just don't play golf.  Yeah, he doesn't.  No, no.  There's a lot of guys that you would never expect.  Lou Reed plays golf. 
[01:25:30]  Okay, now.  Lou Reed and Iggy play golf.  Anthony.  Iggy, I wouldn't say.  Anthony's not a Lou Reed fan.  I've never been a big Lou Reed fan.  I mean, you know, 30 years ago, Lou Reed and I would not have been talking about why the ball is slicing.  Right.  We would have been at the Chelsea Hotel going, who do you know?  Come on, call somebody.  You'd probably laugh about it a couple of times.  Like, oh, my God, we're playing golf.  He actually is very dead serious about it.  How about the chicks?  Are they still, like, easy to get?  You know, I've been married 29 years, and I've never cheated on my wife. 
[01:26:00]  That is the best answer you could ever give.  And no one's applauding that, by the way.  Regardless.  I'm a hero.  He was looking for a little, you know.  Before I was married, though.  Maybe he doesn't consider certain things cheating.  No, no, no.  I'm dead.  I've never cheated on my wife.  Do you play by the Clinton rules?  No, no, no.  Back when Groucho fell asleep.  That was different.  Harpo would come over with somebody.  That wouldn't even be sex, I don't think. 
[01:26:30]  That would just be weird.  That would just be weird.  Don't wake up Groucho.  Pull up some hooker.  I love Groucho.  Didn't he always marry young chicks?  I heard he was a young girl.  Oh, yeah.  He was a young girl.  You know, when I first got married, my wife was 18 years old, and he used to chase her around the house.  It was like a Mark Brothers movie.  I'd come in, and she'd be on his lap, and I'd go, he's 84.  What's he going to do?  Oh.  You know?  And she'd go, get away from my chick.  Right, please. 
[01:27:00]  But he was great.  And if you had dinner at his house, you had to perform.  Marvin Hamlisch was at his house every night playing piano.  So if you had dinner, like if we all went to dinner there, we would have to.  You'd have to tell jokes, or you'd have to sing or dance, and that was it.  That was an old Hollywood tradition.  At Groucho's house, you had to perform.  Wow.  That's amazing.  It was kind of cool, though.  Yeah.  For him, what a genius he was, and just the fact that he liked young chicks.  I just loved that.  Oh, he was great.  Yeah, I heard he was kind of rough on them, too.  He would, like, berate them, and he's just, you know, he's too brilliant. 
[01:27:30]  They're not going to argue with him.  He's just like a young girl.  They didn't even understand what he was saying most of the time.  We were on his birthday.  I took him to a restaurant on his birthday, an 84th or 85th birthday.  And he's sitting there, and he goes, excuse me, I've got to go insult the maitre d'.  And he did.  He walked over, and he goes, I said something, and the maitre d''.  He goes, you know, that's all I saw.  And he looks back at me and goes, I still got it.  That's cool.  All right, Alistair, big plug.  Why are we here today? 
[01:28:00]  I'm here because you guys are so great.  That's it.  You're so great at what you do.  And Samsung.  And especially Opie with his, you know, well-disguised opium problem.  Nobody knows about that.  No, you reissued the DVD, right?  Well, good to see you again.  Good to see you again.  It was one of the worst movies of all time.  One of the best concert footages, though.  It's all the Billion Dollar Babies footage when I was really drinking a lot.  Oh, well, then that's a must-see.  There's some stuff in there where I watched, and I haven't seen it in 25 years. 
[01:28:30]  Was it hard to watch?  Yeah.  No wonder I got banned everywhere.  It was great to watch.  And then there was comedy bits in it that was so bad that now it's great.  Yeah.  It was so horrible for 20 years, and now it's turned the corner and become funny again.  I got to see that.  Yeah.  So it's really fun, especially if you're an Alice aficionado.  This is really great stuff.  I do a lady as a tramp in this.  She gets too hungry.  Really? 
[01:29:00]  Dinner at 8.  In front of an audience?  Oh, yeah.  That's in his room somewhere.  And then a tractor comes through and destroys the whole stage.  So it's great.  All right.  Right on.  Alice Cooper, thank you so much.  Thank you, guys.  Great to have you.  This is great.  This is a fun little place you got here.  Yeah.  Alice Cooper, everyone.  Alice Copper.  Thank you.  Alice Copper.  All right.  We'll continue live from CES with Laszlo and, I guess, Elo as well.  And maybe a surprise, because Ben is freaking out over there.  He might have something for us.  We'll find out next. 
[01:29:30]  Stay there.  I got somebody.  It's the Opie and Anthony Show.  Las Vegas.  Live from Las Vegas.  I'm going to apologize for that.  Stuck in their hotel rooms because they're all pooping green from alcohol poisoning.  That is the sexiest thing I have ever seen.  That is good.  I like that.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  Thank you.  Nice to be in Vegas.  The Opie and Anthony Famous.  Get infected.  We'll get into the Dick Clark thing. 
[01:30:00]  Man, when I saw this on New Year's Eve, I'm like, man, this is way too easy.  This is like the easiest thing you can do on radio is just play the audio and goof on it.  Yeah.  So here's, uh, here's, uh, here's, uh, we're going to hear a little Dick.  Here's the big intro to Dick Clark.  Ladies and gentlemen, back where he belongs, the one and only Mr. Dick Clark.  Dick, take it away.  Take it away. 
[01:30:30]  You dick.  You dick.  All right, here we go.  Let's get back to this.  I'm sorry.  Ladies and gentlemen, back where he belongs, the one and only Mr. Dick Clark.  Dick, take it away.  Ah.  Ah.  Ah. 
[01:31:00]  Ah.  Ah.  Ah.  Ah.  Ah.  Oh, isn't that horrible?  All right.  Let's, uh, let's get into the audio.  There's a lot of clips here.  Ladies and gentlemen, back where he belongs, the one and only Mr. Dick Clark.  Dick, take it away.  Ah.  Ah.  Ah. 
[01:31:30]  Ah.  Ah.  Ah.  Ah.  Ah.  Ah.  Ah.  Ah.  Ah.  Ah.  Ah.  Ah.  Ah.  Ah.  Ah.  Ah.  Ah.  Ah.  Ah.  I'll be an Anthony.  Send you to them.  Comedian Bill Burr.  Live.  Hello, this is Bill Burr.  I'm going to be at Caroline's Comedy Club in New York City, January 5th through the 8th.

[01:34:00]  Hey, it's an autographed picture of the Mad Mexican and Chicago.  Wow, we've got to bring this back to New York.  It says, best wishes, O&A and Jim.  It says, the Mad Mexican, and then Chicago.  He's pointing to Chicago.  That dog is adorable.  Isn't it, Anthony?  Look at that.  What a cute dog.  Isn't that nice?  Aw, look at the little white face.  He's got, like, a little, uh, white face.  No, you didn't.  Jesus Christ. 
[01:34:30]  Oh, babe.  Here we go.  Oh, babe.  That's wrong.  Oh.  Little, little white dog.  Is he out there?  Oh, my God.  You know, even I, and I've been.  That's money, too, for those pictures.  I've been, uh, with Opie on the air now for, uh, just about, like, ten years.  Ten years.  Even I didn't see that coming. 
[01:35:00]  I swear to you, I did not think you would do that.  Oh, my God.  I took the time to write Chicago with a little arrow.  With an arrow.  With an arrow.  With his cute little dog.  You are a prick.  Oh.  You are a prick.  A little dog all happy.  Oh.  It's like, can you get another one, please?  Yeah.  Please get another one.  Just tell him something happened.  We spilled coffee on it.  Yeah, that's a good one.  Tell him we spilled some Opie on it.  Yeah.  You are awful, man. 
[01:35:30]  The guy.  We'll get another one.  Oh, that makes me so happy.  Where do you get the other one?  You are really not right.  Yeah, we'll get another one.  That's something happened.  Carlo, bring me a side picture.  Something happened to you.  That is more of a visual.  Yeah.  Because you just see everyone's faces just get really uncomfortable.  But that comes through audio very, very well.  That rip was pretty distinct.  People knew what was going on.  No one thought that was a newspaper. 
[01:36:00]  All right.  Well, Anthony.  Hey, this is a really nice picture.  Look at the dog.  All right.  I wonder what he's doing.  I knew it was a bad move.  As soon as I saw the picture, it turned sideways.  I'm like, yeah.  I think it'd be wrapped up.  Yeah.  It turned sideways, and it was over.  It is the cutest publicity shot ever, too.  It really is.  Him holding a little dog.  All proud and stuff with his Chicago hat or shirt on.  Oh, it's adorable.  Opie and Anthony, the virus is spreading. 
[01:36:30]  Opie and Anthony, the Opie and Anthony, the Opie virus is spreading across America. 
[01:37:00]  Thanks, XM Satellite Radio.  Anthony talking to his online friends.  During the whole break, the pal talk people.  They have a lot of questions during commercial break.  Yeah.  And, you know, asking who these people are that come up and shake hands.  Will you have the camera on tonight?  Yeah, Vegas Cam will be on.  Turned inside the room?  No, it's always outside the room.  Although, last night I was a little worried.  I'm walking past to go to the bathroom, and I started thinking, is there a reflection off  the window that maybe they can say?  Anthony's naked ass. 
[01:37:30]  That's a screen cap on my dick.  This big Italian hog.  Remember that on eBay?  There was like a collection of pictures that people had taken of stuff that they were selling,  like a toaster or something like that.  You could actually see the reflection of them taking the picture naked.  Yeah, yeah.  There was like a tea kettle was one of them, and somebody was taking a picture of it to  put up on eBay.  And if you looked, you could see the reflection of them, a little funhouse mirror-like, but  completely naked.  Some guy was junk hanging out. 
[01:38:00]  There was another one like a spoon, some old spoon, antique spoon, and the reflection  in there was some old woman, saggy kids, just sitting there snapping a picture.  Very nice.  We got to say hi to Kimmy, the porn star.  Kimmy.  Yeah, hi.  How am I?  You might want to boost the phone volume slightly if you do that.  Yes, let's hear her.  Here, is that better?  Hey, guys, what's up?  Do we know you?  Do I know you?  Do we know you?  Oh!  Wow, are you a frequent visitor of Big Tits, Round Asses, or Ass Parade Bang Bros? 
[01:38:30]  Of what?  Bang Bros.  Bang Bus?  Dibber-dibber.  I'm on Big Tits and Ass Parade, plus I'm an adult film star.  All I hear is, blam, blam, blam, blam, blam.  I heard a adult film star.  We can't hear you.  Are you on a cell phone?  Yeah, I'm on a cell phone.  Okay, we can hardly hear you.  All right, let's try this again.  So what do you got, Kimmy?  Well, I wanted to call and tell you that about two months ago, when you had the girls on trying 
[01:39:00]  out the strap-on, I was driving across country and had to stop and pull over to get my vibrator  out of the car so I could masturbate while I was listening to you guys' stuff.  I was wondering.  It was that good.  Where do you keep the vibrator?  Is it in, like, the glove compartment stuck to a map?  No.  Yeah, I keep the pocket rocket in the side door just in case I get bored.  I'm actually driving there now. 
[01:39:30]  She's got it back there with the road flares.  Right.  She's got it all over the place.  People behind me were kind of confused of what was going on as I was swerving.  She's got to hide in the guns in the Escalade.  She's got all the traps for her sex toys.  So you were on Banged Buzz?  No, I was on Big Tits, Round Asses.  Oh, I never knew there was a website called that.  Of course there is.  Yeah.  And Ass Parade.  If you just do a search for Kimmy, you should find it. 
[01:40:00]  But I'm on my way to the convention right now.  Where are you going to be at the convention?  Oh, like, all over.  Around.  That narrows it right down.  Why?  I don't understand why I'm getting so many messages here that say a dumb hole.  What's the matter?  Oh, there's probably some kind of a technical glitch or something.  Yeah, yeah.  That must be computer terminology.  What's a dumb hole?  Is that something with the hard drive? 
[01:40:30]  Yeah.  The problem with the hard drive?  It tends to be a fault on the hard drive.  It doesn't boot up correctly.  Just get random bullshit on the screen.  Ramone, get this whore off the phone.  Ramone, she should be blowing this serious dog.  They love the serious humor, man.  Well, we were having a stellar show up to this point.  Oh, the big break handle.  The first phone call.  Yeah, come on, Kimmy.  You were the first phone call today.  Shut up!  I know, and what I was going to say is I have friends upstairs, so if you would like visitors, all I have to do is call and have them come down to see you. 
[01:41:00]  You have friends upstairs where?  Heaven?  At the convention.  At ABN.  Shut up!  Who are your friends?  You know, Sikaria?  Yes, the squirter.  Yes.  She was my older man.  So that's kind of mine.  Do you know who Nadia Stiles is?  Um, no. 
[01:41:30]  She's a host of Night Calls on Playboy Channel?  Um, no, I've never heard that.  Okay.  What's worse than porn stars in the studio?  You know who Jennifer Sky is?  On the phone.  Right.  Right.  Very good.  What's that?  Jennifer Sky.  Let me ask you a question.  Now, you're on a website, right?  Yes.  Now, do you feel, my friend of mine, like, peruses a lot of adult websites, do you feel  that a lot of people are saying that with the advanced technology, that when you kind  of look back on the way pornography was, they say that there are certain switches, but 
[01:42:00]  are you feeling that that's got something to do with that, or is it because of what went  beyond from the first time?  Oh, yeah.  Very good question.  Good question.  Kimmy?  What?  I'm sorry, you're asking, I couldn't understand the last part that you said.  Oh, it's probably a bad connection.  What I'm saying is, because you do stuff on the web, do you feel that technology is  bringing things to a certain point where it was, or is it not because of that, that  we're now dealing with this, at least with the FCC?  Oh, very good, yeah.  Great question.  Kimmy? 
[01:42:30]  Are you saying with the new laws that have come out about doing porn on the internet?  Holy crap, how dumb are you?  One more time, Kimmy.  It's actually hard to hear because there's people here.  Simplify the question for who you're dealing with.  What I'm saying is this, because I know a lot of people have been saying that the web,  like a lot of people say they're going after the web now, and I'm saying, do you feel that  the technology is kind of conducive with what was not happening before, or is it ever  going to switch to the way that people had always projected?  I think, are you talking about the laws, right?  Oh, my God. 
[01:43:00]  Oh, my God.  It has nothing to do with the laws.  Listen to the question.  Jesus.  No, no, no.  What I'm saying is the laws is what sparked this question.  Because they were saying that the FCC was going to try to crack down due to certain  traffic, and I'm saying, do you feel that the technology, has it at all been conducive,  or, you know, because?  Yes or no?  I think no.  No?  What?  Are you crazy?  Why do you think that?  Yeah, why do you think no?  Yeah, back that up.  You're going out on a limb saying no. 
[01:43:30]  You're the first person to say no to that question.  Especially with podcasting.  Right.  Right.  It goes without saying, Laszlo.  Why do you think no?  I mean, you might be right, but why do you think no?  Well, basically, the Internet stuff, now base, there's so many websites, right, on the  Internet, and so many people that are doing the same thing on the Internet.  But you're not addressing the question.  You're not addressing anything of what Jim asked you.  Yeah, no, no.  You're right.  She's actually right.  There are a lot of sites, but I'm only talking about...  She's going off on a tangent. 
[01:44:00]  I'm only talking about the way the laws are perceived.  Due to the fact that the technology isn't where people had once projected, but then  again, that's what...  That people aren't getting what the people are saying that they're putting out there?  Like, you're not...  Well, yeah, that in a nutshell.  If you want to take it in that direction, fine.  Go ahead.  Why do you think that is then?  Yeah, man, I don't want to be argumentative.  That the websites aren't projecting what they're saying that they're selling?  Questions with questions?  What?  We want an answer.  Yeah, I'm saying, do you feel that it's ever going to go back to the way that they used 
[01:44:30]  to say it was, or no?  No, no.  I think that they're going to crack down on it more, and the laws are going to continue  on, and that's what the problem is right now.  That's why all the websites went down, because they cracked down on the laws.  You had to have all the paperwork for every model on the site, and everything like that.  Absolutely.  And I think they're going to continue to do that.  And that's what happened.  It was the funniest piece of ass I've ever had, and I've had them all over the world.  You're actually right, but do you object to the fact that Robert Reed is now doing pornography? 
[01:45:00]  Who?  Robert Reed.  Robert Reed.  Everyone knows Robert Reed.  Yeah, him and Arthur Ashe are producing a line of films called I Wouldn't Swallow That  If I Were You.  Oh, my gosh.  Sorry.  I have no idea about that.  No?  No.  Good stuff.  All right.  No, I think with the web stuff, what it is is that they're just cracking down on  porn, period, and they're cracking down by making laws and making sure that you have  to have all the paperwork, everything has to be dated, everything has to be... 
[01:45:30]  You think?  Yeah.  Where are you going to be at the expo?  Do you have a booth you're going to be in?  Are you going to be in a booth?  I'll be visiting a couple different booths.  I'm coming with actually a location place that I work for.  It's called 818 Movie Locations, and they do all the houses, and that's why I'm going  down there to...  But I'm saying, I'm going to be over at the expo later.  Probably, I just wanted to know, I'm going to be leaking some clear stuff. 
[01:46:00]  Where will you be?  I will be there Friday.  Food, all right.  All right, Kimmy.  I'm driving right now.  That's what I'm saying.  I'm on my cell phone.  I'm driving from California right now.  Oh, wow.  All right.  Just be careful.  If I could send nerve toxin through the phone, I would do it.  Kimmy, thank you.  It's always a pleasure, I guess.  But I do enjoy your guys' show, and I do listen to it a lot of next time, so...  Thank you.  Kimmy Zink.  Yeah, call us any time, all right?  Thank you.  You were wonderful.  All right.  Wait, wait, Kimmy. 
[01:46:30]  Yeah, it is.  Bravo.  Well, that was great.  Very informative.  Very informative.  Ouch.  I got my vibrator out, did you?  Did you?  I wanted her question.  I wanted Jimmy's question answered with a skid and a crash sound from her phone and a loss  of connection.  Thank you, Harry Chapin, for calling the program.  Do you know the meaning of the word abutment?  You steer into one. 
[01:47:00]  All right, let's get back to Laszlo.  We are talking about technology here.  Yeah, I was checking out some...  Laszlo, do you have an answer to Jimmy's question?  Yeah.  Yes or no, and why is it no?  Yes.  Ask.  I was checking out this technology for digital cameras that has, again, GPS stuff.  Yeah.  That actually will try...  And they're doing it for mobile phone cameras, so that when you take the picture, it does  a search and triangulates your position and tags the data of exactly where that picture  was taken.  Where it was taken. 
[01:47:30]  Now, this probably...  You know where this will come in handy?  Parents with sluts for daughters.  That's the way...  That's who should be...  This should be marketed towards.  Because let's say you have a slut for a daughter.  You give her this phone, and then at any given moment, you say, take a picture of what's  around you.  Now, they've done this with camera phones.  Actually, parents have done this.  And they email them the picture, but they've taken the picture earlier, something like that.  They turn around.  Now, they can find out where their slutty daughter is if they're at that boyfriend's  house. 
[01:48:00]  Jimmy Norton's address pops up.  There's also...  Over and over again.  You see five-dictionary face and it reads Mogadishu.  There's also services that you can put, like, you can take a picture of yourself and put  a fake background in, like a bar or...  Oh, that's fantastic.  Yeah, and there's also sound effects that some phones, you can hit buttons, so there's  sound effects.  So it's like, where are you?  And then there's like a...  I'm at the train station.  I'm at the train station.  Really, you're...  Choo, choo, chugga, chugga, chugga.  Right.  Meanwhile, you're in a hotel room.  Chugga, chugga, chugga. 
[01:48:30]  Right.  Hello.  Do they now have a...  Hello.  Hey, by the way, we should mention that Keith the Cop came on the trip with us this time.  Keith the Copper.  You had some problems, I heard, with...  Last year.  With Club Soda Kenny.  Yeah.  Well, that was my doing, and now we're...  We've been paying for it ever since.  And now we're paying for it a year later.  Opie had to go to L.A. in order to get to Vegas because of that.  Yes.  Dude, I didn't even want to hear about flights.  My flight was atrocious.  I had a nightmare situation getting in. 
[01:49:00]  What happened to me?  My...  I can barely say it, right?  You're upset.  Do you understand?  My croissant was too flaky.  I looked over and saw you completely aggravated as flakes were coming off of this thing.  Yes.  I know you had a bad day, but you weren't...  And how many times did you guys look at the empty seat and laugh?  Right behind me.  No, I didn't laugh.  Because all I'm thinking about is him doing impressions and me trying to stretch and the 
[01:49:30]  fucking show bombing.  So I was like...  I didn't find any of it.  Could you do Reagan again?  No.  While I do another predictable age joke?  No.  I hope that fucking noon comes.  No direction whatsoever.  No.  We'll be back right after this.  Ben is vomiting.  Well, I guess for the new listeners, last year, Club Soda Kenny was here and we kind  of disrupted the other guy's press conference.  It was a good press conference, too.  Ladies and gentlemen, this year we have nothing new.  Yeah.  And it was my doing.  And I think Kenny's been banned from CES for his life now or something like that. 
[01:50:00]  No, just for this one.  Because now if we come here again next year, he will be joining us.  All right.  We will not have to go through that.  The reason I brought Keith the Cop onto the show, Keith's doing a great job and Keith  does a lot of these gigs with Sidecar.  They work great together.  Who?  Club Soda.  I like to call him Sidecar, Kenny.  That's never, ever going to catch on.  Never.  I like it, though.  He will always be Club Soda, Kenny.  But he's Sidecar to me.  Coke will be in bottles before that happens.  We're just trying to change his image. 
[01:50:30]  Bunch of you-know-what playing the faggist ball game in the underwear.  All right.  So Club Soda and Keith taped some stuff for us.  Because we all miss Club Soda Kenny.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Kenny and I got together in the studio before we came on the trip.  And I recorded some things with him.  And I have specific times that I'm supposed to play these clips.  So I look at my instructions.  And then in the morning when we get in the car...  Good morning, everyone. 
[01:51:00]  Oh, see?  Now that's Kenny saying good morning, everyone.  I like that.  And then after, I get everyone situated in the car right before I put the car into drive.  Buckle up for safety.  So, Kenny...  A quick buckle up for safety by Club Soda Kenny.  So, Kenny is still on this trip with us.  In spirit, anyway.  I heard that this morning, and it gave me a little smile.  Yeah, it gave me a great smile.  I missed his phone call, because usually I get a call in the room.  Rise and shine, sunshine. 
[01:51:30]  I'll see you downstairs.  Do you need anything?  And if you want coffee or water, he's there with it.  The guy is great.  He's like a eunuch.  It's like having a eunuch around just to do your bidding.  Right.  It's wonderful.  And then I was sitting in the lobby waiting for you guys to come down this morning, and  a couple people walked by.  You dropped something.  The gag that he pulls on everybody.  Oh, wonderful.  The you dropped something gag.  They taped like, I don't know, dozens of these things.  Yeah, I have a whole bunch. 
[01:52:00]  I was walking around the casino with Keith the Cop, and he was playing a bunch of them  for me yesterday.  Yeah, it helps tell me a story, and I'm going, oh, yeah, good, good, good.  And then Kenny goes, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  I don't know where he's playing this stuff.  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  And then later on tonight when Anthony goes gambling, I'm supposed to go with Anthony,  and as he's sitting at the table, I'm not quite sure what this one means.  Maybe you can explain it.  Monkey, monkey, monkey.  Monkey, monkey. 
[01:52:30]  You want the 10 card.  You want a picture card.  Yeah, I had no idea.  10, 10.  You've doubled down.  You've doubled down.  You have an 11.  Monkey.  I thought maybe you were just telling the dealer to give you a card.  He would do that every time.  I used to do that when Dice would gamble.  Kenny and Happy would scream monkey and slap the table.  Really?  I've seen other people do that.  I refuse.  So it's not exclusive to them.  I don't know what it means.  I watched them lose over 200 grand in cash, and I wouldn't jump in and yell monkey.  No?  No, it's embarrassing. 
[01:53:00]  Good.  Very, very good.  So, Keith, thank you.  So, yes, Kenny is here in spirit with us.  Yes, he is.  Is Elo around?  We've got to talk to him before we leave the airwaves.  Elo.  We only have, like, five minutes left in the show already.  And what are we doing for the rest of today?  That's it.  Oh, ho, ho.  It's going to be a little eating and then some Texas Hold'em for Ant.  And what's the deal with the Hold'em at the casino?  I'm going to...  I'm going to play in and all that.  There's all different ones.  Oh, you could get in a no-limit game for very cheap. 
[01:53:30]  You just buy in.  Do you wear sunglasses?  No, I don't play that whole crap game.  I just sit there.  Everyone thinks they're a professional.  And you just sit there.  You look at the people with the sunglasses, and you laugh as they lose their money.  I can't believe you haven't gambled yet, though.  I gambled.  I told you.  I made $1,200 on Google options.  I had Google call options that I dumped this morning.  Nice.  Nice.  I'm in Vegas gambling on my computer.  Well, we'll see how Anthony does tomorrow on the program.  Elo, these two-hour shows are killing us. 
[01:54:00]  What do you want?  Longer?  Shorter?  What do you mean?  Shorter, obviously.  Yeah, I'm exhausted.  We're filling time right now.  You flew entirely across the country to do a two-hour show, and you're complaining.  Yeah.  We want to do an hour and 45 minutes, because the first hour and 45 minutes of the show  rocked.  I noticed the new units are missing from the table.  Who took them?  Are they in someone's pocket?  Well, the show's wrapping up, so they had to require them back.  I'm ratting out, because I don't have one.  I don't have one.  You have one.  Jimmy, did you take one?  No.  Actually, I had one for Jimmy for Christmas, but he wouldn't give me his home address, 
[01:54:30]  so that was...  Oh.  That was what I was trying to send you.  I just didn't want you to feel obligated to give me a gift, because you don't have to.  I mean, the fact that I felt a little left out is okay.  You've asked me for a new car, which I'm still working on.  Thank you.  Yeah, he's working on a car for Jimmy.  Where are our Christmas gifts?  You got the mail to your house.  It went to the office.  Yours went to the house.  Mine went to my house?  When?  Yours went to the office.  When?  Before Christmas. 
[01:55:00]  That's why it's a Christmas gift.  You're kidding, right?  I swear to God, you wanted yours to be sent to the office.  Well, you might as well tell me what you sent me, because I still haven't received  it.  What is Anthony's favorite gift?  What does he love to give?  Hummers?  That is.  I've got to say, that's up on the list.  Two damage?  Yeah, that's right.  And it's not Cadillac car doors.  It is a gift card.  A gift card.  I don't have a gift card from Elon.  You have a gift card. 
[01:55:30]  It's got your name on it.  You didn't send them yet, did you?  No, I did.  Did you get one, Ed?  Yes, I got one.  Yeah, they both run at the same time.  Absolutely.  Yeah.  They did.  Everybody's looking around.  Somebody's going through your mail.  You now have an issue.  Are you kidding?  I swear to God.  How much was it for, Ed?  I don't remember.  It wasn't enough.  It wasn't meaningful.  I noticed that Steve has a new coach purse, though.  You're going to take that from him?  Steve just turns around and goes, what?  I don't know why Eric Magel all of a sudden has a PSP, but he's certainly enjoying it. 
[01:56:00]  Same joke, but the boss said it.  Well, that's why I didn't thank you.  But you know what?  Because the coach first made it work.  Out with Lazlo, in with Elo.  Yeah, that's right.  That's why I didn't thank you.  I did not receive that.  Absolutely.  Steve Elo.  All right, what's on the agenda for the rest of the day there, Elo?  Oh, good grief.  Busy day for you, right?  Busy day.  Yeah, we're just walking around, meeting people.  Do you remember last time we came here, Opie, when we still were in that,  we just got the jobs, let's kiss a little ass.  We were in meetings, we were in a closed door meeting with our agent in that back room 
[01:56:30]  that I wanted out of, so I'm in Las Vegas.  I don't want to sit in meetings with brass.  Well, because of that, I did need to grab you guys about five minutes after this.  No!  There is nothing on unless you are taking me to a poker table.  I called you yesterday about a meeting.  You didn't return my call.  I left you a message yesterday.  Exactly.  I didn't get it.  That's why we have to do it now.  I have a dealer waiting for me. 
[01:57:00]  I have a meeting room waiting for us.  There's a dealer in the waiting room.  How's that?  Just hand over those new radios.  That's all I want.  That's right.  That's all I want.  Unless that's what that meeting entails.  I want to play with it all night, so I'm well informed tomorrow on the show.  Well informed tomorrow.  We'll make sure that happens.  All right.  We'll make sure it happens.  And I'll email it, and I'll send it to you the same way your gift card is missing.  We'll be back tomorrow, this very location, for another rigorous two-hour program.  Wow.  Yeah.  I need a nap now.  I got to tell you.  And you're flying back.  Hey, press conferences and that type of thing today? 
[01:57:30]  No.  All the releases went out yesterday.  Yep.  So.  XM is...  Rocking, baby.  XM is rocking.  A big buzz at CES with XM and the new U.S.  Huge.  Huge.  Huge.  Huge.  Huge.  And what's the voice activation thing?  Oh, it's the car over here.  We'll talk about that tomorrow.  That's in a concept car or something, right?  It's a concept car.  It's amazing.  You know, it's sort of like, you know, go-to Opie and Anthony.  Yeah.  Bam.  Done.  Thank you guys.  Congratulations on the six million, by the way.  Thank you.  Six million subscribers.  Thank you guys.  Six million dollar company.  And you know what?  Six million subscriber company.  Six million subscriber.  Yeah, subscriber. 
[01:58:00]  What were you going to say about that?  I was going to say, a lot of them are listening to O&A, more so than our friend.  I promise you that.  Yes.  Well, why don't we get paid like he does then?  Wow.  Where am I?  36 million shares of stock.  Can you see that?  We're begging for a lousy new radio.  36 million shares of stock.  Okay, I'll get to the radio.  Yes.  That's the least you get there.  There you go.  We get ready.  You heard it here, people.  It's Elo, everyone.  Let's hear it for Elo, the big guy that makes it all happen.  This is the Opie and Anthony program. 
[01:58:30]  We'll see you tomorrow live from Las Vegas at C.E.F.  Thanks for listening.  This concludes our podcast day.  It will be an Anthony show.  Oh, man.  Nasty hangover?  Yeah.  Why don't you take Chaser?  You know, the pill that helps stop a hangover?  Does that stuff really work?  I mean, come on.  It makes sense when you know how it works.  Listen, just take two Chaser caplets with your first drink and two more later.  Chaser is made up of specially processed calcium, carbonate, and charcoal.  See, these ingredients attract and absorb hangover-causing toxins and pass them out of your system. 
[01:59:00]  That's it.  The next morning, you wake up feeling great.  Ah, so it works kind of like a filter.  Right.  And in clinical trials, Chaser reduced hangover symptoms as much as 70% over placebo.  Yeah, but can't I just take some aspirin?  Aspirin only dulls the agony once you have a hangover.  But Chaser helps stop hangovers before they start.  So Chaser absorbs toxins to help prevent hangovers.  Yep.  Take it while you drink to help you wake up feeling great.  Chaser products are available at all Walgreens, CVS, Rite Aid, and GNC stores.  That's Walgreens, CVS, Rite Aid, and GNC. 
[01:59:30]  Chaser does not prevent intoxication.  Please drink responsibly.  Never drink and drive.  Not intended for persons under 21.  For more information, go to ChaserOnline.com.
