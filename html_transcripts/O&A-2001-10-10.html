<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opened with Anthony recounting his hilariously awful experience at the Friars Club lunch, populated by extremely elderly members.  He described the excessive hugging, a man seemingly with a raccoon on his head, and the less-than-hygienic bathroom facilities,  mentioning Adam Ferrara's presence.  Listener calls followed, mostly mocking Anthony for his company.

The show then heavily promoted "Whip Em Out Wednesday," a contest encouraging women to flash their breasts upon seeing a specific car sticker, referencing a similar promotion in Las Vegas and a memorable "Today Show" incident.  The hosts detailed plans for their 100th syndicated show in Philadelphia, featuring Days of the New, Stephen Lynch, Rich Voss, Anthony's band Rotgut, and a bikini contest, noting a prank by program director Tim Sabian who created an advertisement heavily favoring Days of the New.

A search for "Earl," the holder of Yankee tickets, was announced, with listeners tasked with finding him in Manhattan.  Calls continued, including one reporting "Whip Em Out Wednesday" successes and another from a San Francisco advertising agency. The FBI's Most Wanted list and a humorous anecdote about Saudi men attempting to open a plane's emergency exit for better ventilation were also discussed.  The vulgar and offensive humor characteristic of the show continued throughout this section.

A rambling segment followed, beginning with a sexually explicit Louie Anderson impersonation, culminating in a call from Louie Anderson himself, referencing a past scandal involving hush money paid to a male prostitute.  This transitioned into a Jimmy Stewart prank call and an extensive discussion of "Stalker Patty," a show stalker, particularly targeting Opie.  A lengthy, poorly written apology letter from Patty was read and mocked, detailing her eviction and other issues.  Her erratic behavior at a previous show, including an incident where she allegedly urinated on herself, was also discussed.  The Madonna abortion rumors provided further fodder for graphic and sexually suggestive humor.  Jim Norton and Adam Corolla were mentioned as being in studio.  Tenacious D was mentioned as an upcoming guest.

An in-studio interview with Tenacious D (Jack Black and Kyle Gass) followed, beginning with a thank you for a listener donation and quickly transitioning into a juvenile song about fetuses. They recounted their experience on TRL, compared their fan reception to that of boy bands, discussed partying with Carson Daly, and humorously explained their band's origin story.  Their HBO show's cancellation, upcoming movie, and various career anecdotes were also discussed.  Callers frequently interrupted, asking about future projects and collaborations, including work with Dave Grohl.  They performed "Malibu Nights" (with tuning issues) and "Wonder Boy," interspersed with numerous off-color jokes and sexually suggestive comments about Fran Drescher, the Taliban, and other topics.  A Sam Adams commercial aired.

The show concluded with a segment where callers shared what they'd "learned" that day, showcasing crude humor, offensive jokes, and references to Stalker Patty, Madonna, Milton Berle, and other celebrities. Anthonyâ€™s bathroom attendant preference was also mentioned.  Jokes about bodily functions, anthrax (in relation to Stalker Patty), and a fictional "super lady" arch-nemesis to Stalker Patty were featured.  The hosts promoted upcoming guests Brian Regan and Frank Caliendo and ended with improvised comedy involving Ted Baxter and a *Too Close for Comfort* character impersonations.  The segment maintained the show's extensive use of shock humor and offensive language.

[00:00:30]  It's Wimple Mal Wednesday. It's Wimple Mal Wednesday. It's Wimple Mal Wednesday.  I can't see your appointment.  It's Wimple Mal Wednesday. It's Wimple Mal Wednesday. It's Wimple Mal Wednesday.  Stay out the bushes.  It's Wimple Mal Wednesday. It's Wimple Mal Wednesday. It's Wimple Mal Wednesday. 
[00:01:00]  Oh, boy, yeah. 
[00:01:30]  And welcome to the Opie and Anthony Show.  Hello.  A couple phone numbers in the New York area, 877-692-1027.  Anywhere else, 866-277-4WOW.  That's 866-277-4WOW.  So, Opie, I had a Jurassic lunch today. 
[00:02:00]  Jurassic lunch.  Jurassic lunch.  What the hell is Jurassic lunch?  Well, my pal, Adam Ferrara, he is a member of the Friars Club, as you know.  They did a roast a couple weeks ago for Hugh Hefner.  Now you're going to the Friars Club.  So, I went to...  Well, Adam is a friar.  So, I figured everyone in Boston is shaking their head.  They're like, I remember Anthony when he used to just hang out at Ebeneezer's and gets hammered with us.  Well, I would still be... 
[00:02:30]  Now he's hanging out with other comedians at the Friars Club.  Well, there's the misconception.  I thought I'd walk in and be a bunch of comedians around.  Probably the funniest gosh darn place on the planet.  Because of all the comics that are members of the Friars Club.  Oh, my God.  At least I know I'm not funny enough to go to the Friars Club.  And I'm happy that I'm not funny enough to be in that establishment.  No, it has nothing to do with...  I thought that, too, before you did. 
[00:03:00]  Do you have to tell a few jokes to get in?  Yeah, you've got to tell a couple of hot ones.  Do they have, like, a bouncer?  A velvet rope, and you've got to do some knock-knock jokes, and if you're funny enough, they let you in?  No, I think the test is if you have lost 90% of your bone density,  you're allowed to then sit down and eat at the Friars Club.  Did you see anyone famous at the Friars Club?  My pal Adam.  Adam Farrar.  That's it.  Starring in The Job with Dennis Lurie. 
[00:03:30]  I saw Adam there.  That's about it.  Who else was there?  That old guy saying, I used to be a young Italian stud.  Now I'm just an old Jew.  He's walking around going, I'm an old Jew.  That's right.  Don't be old Jew bit.  You've got to be Jewish to go to the Friars Club, too.  Right.  I've heard about that.  When he talked to Adam, and Adam goes, no, we're all Italian here.  He goes, oh, check the silverware.  That was like his joke, you know?  But, I mean, people that are so old.  One guy had a raccoon on his head, I think. 
[00:04:00]  I didn't know you could bring animals in,  but he had a multicolored raccoon.  Well, maybe that's what he was having for lunch.  It was a tarantula.  Hey, a tarantula's on his head.  It's what it looked like.  One of those big, hairy things on his head.  It was a mess.  Maybe he was going to have it sauteed.  Yeah, that's part of the dinner.  Over a little pasta.  Sure.  A lot of old ladies coming up to Adam and giving him big hugs and kisses, too.  Yeah, yeah.  That was frightening.  Dude, I'm talking decrepit old.  Like, so old.  Like, 75-year-old is the youngest. 
[00:04:30]  With the, yeah, the faces pulled back.  And the makeup that's on.  Like, that grandma lipstick after, you know,  after 20 years after your lips have disappeared,  or just turned the same color as your skin,  and they just don't know what lines to follow anymore.  And more of it's on their teeth than their lips.  Yeah, yeah, it's on their teeth.  So they're like, Adam, come here.  They love Adam.  Grabbing him.  I think one grabbed his junk.  Sure, grabbed his ass right there in the Friars Club.  It's amazing. 
[00:05:00]  Let's go to Eric.  Eric, what's up?  What's up, boys?  You guys know you just jumped the shark, right?  The minute Anthony starts going to the Friars Club, you fate.  Yeah, that's it.  I'm glad you noticed, Eric.  I went with my pal.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Back to you, Rusty.  All right, Eric.  Why couldn't I go with my pal Adam?  You can go wherever you want.  I know.  I don't understand why I'm catching flack from other listeners.  It was a great one.  You brought the average age down to 80, I think so.  I'm assuming.  Yeah, yeah. 
[00:05:30]  Well, it's a very old establishment.  Yeah.  It's steeped in tradition, I guess, and oldness.  Adam gave me a tour, too, by the way.  He, like, took me around to the upstairs where they have the massage room.  Do they have, like, a steam room?  Yeah, a steam room.  It's got the...  Go to get even more wrinkly?  And it smells like old person.  Like powder?  And it's got...  Yeah.  And the can was, like, right next to the head of the massage table.  What?  The toilet?  Yeah. 
[00:06:00]  Ew.  I didn't get that.  It's a hell of a way to have a massage.  I'm trying to relax and...  Yeah.  Andrew.  Hey, guys.  Hey.  Hey, two things.  Is there a secret handshake, and do they serve any solid food?  No, it's all pre-chewed, the food.  Like, you ever see the old Discovery Channel things in Africa?  The youngsters chew the food for the elders?  You could get that if you need it.  If you need, they will chew it.  The good thing about the Friars Club, they got these young, bodacious babes at every table  that chew the food for the old people.  Yeah, that's how they got to hire them, though.  And it costs a good dime, but they chew it up real good, then spit it into the old people's 
[00:06:30]  mouth like they're just so many baby birds.  Did you get to see Milton Berle's junk?  No.  Yeah, it's a famous junk.  I'm not in, you know.  So I was just there as a guest of Adam Ferrara.  Will you be going back to the Friars Club?  Um, I don't know.  For a free lunch, I'm there.  It was great lunch and stuff, but I don't know.  I couldn't see hanging out there, that's for sure.  So I don't think you've got to worry about Anthony being there all the time. 
[00:07:00]  I was wondering what was up, because you're wearing a collared shirt today.  Will Adam said, dress nice.  I know you.  You had to tell me.  You know, dress nice.  Dress like you're going to a golf course.  And Rick looks like he's going to be an extra in Miami Vice or something.  Rick joined us.  Yeah, everyone had to wear the collared shirt.  Had to wear a collared shirt, so that means I had to wear, like, nice pants.  And my brother Joe fits great in a collared shirt with a tattoo.  Normally, it's like a well-dressed convict.  Normally, it's against my religion to wear a collared shirt. 
[00:07:30]  You only look like that when you go in front of a judge.  I know.  Who are you kidding?  Fred, what's up?  You must impress the jury.  I do services in that building every year on their fireplaces.  Yeah.  That place smells like a nursing home the second you walk in.  And they even have, in the bathrooms, the bottles of the blue liquid with the combs in them.  And on the top floor, there's one room that just has chess and checkers tables.  And they all sit in there.  And it looks like a morgue.  Everybody's just sitting there practically dead.  They are all.  What are you doing there, Andy? 
[00:08:00]  What are you doing?  You're the new generation.  What are you doing with that?  What are you doing with my pal?  Here's how Adam became a friar.  A bunch of people from the vaudeville days?  Vaudeville.  What does a friar even mean?  Well, I have no idea.  Adam wasn't a friar.  He said they're effing friar.  Hey, Fred.  Bye.  Fred.  I'm going to hang up on you.  All right.  There you go.  God, he's yelling.  He's cursing.  Well, let me talk.  Adam wasn't a friar until they said, I guess it was Jeffrey Ross said, you want to do the roast? 
[00:08:30]  And Adam goes, I'm not a friar.  And Jeffrey Ross goes, no, here, there, you're a friar.  Like tapped him on the head or something and made him one.  So Adam didn't know what it was all about either.  And then he goes there and sees the wolf.  So now he takes me to lunch there.  And I look around and go, wow, this is old.  I picture in maybe two, three weeks, there's going to be lots of empty tables there.  Because I can't see them people lasting that.  You're changing it.  Am I?  Yeah.  It's a little weird, right, Jeff? 
[00:09:00]  Flying first class to Florida.  Yeah.  Now you're going to the Friars Club.  I just fly.  Let me tell you, I'll fly first class so I can be the guy that grabs the guy going for the door.  I asked Dan, I think recently, because we used to go to peep shows.  And I remember you and I would handle each other in a show.  And now all of a sudden it's a big deal.  I don't want to do that anymore.  I got a girlfriend.  Jim is the best at the reverse crank.  You know, it's very difficult to master that.  All right, well, sounds like you guys have a really great lunch time. 
[00:09:30]  Good food.  Good food.  Plenty of it.  All right.  A couple things really fast.  It is Whip Em Out Wednesday.  Yes.  This may sound very familiar to Las Vegas because there's a radio show there that has been doing  it for, I don't know, well over a year or so.  Oh, that's right.  I forgot.  That's what I love about this syndication thing, that we could finally get justice as far as  the greatest radio promotion ever, Whip Em Out Wednesday.  Wow.  It's very easy to put wow on the back of your ride.  Right.  It doesn't matter how you put it there.  It could be one of the wow stickers if the station you're listening to us on has the special 
[00:10:00]  wow stickers.  If not, make a homemade sign.  That works well.  Write it in the dirt on the back of your car.  And if the ladies feel like it, they will wow you on the way home from work.  You'll see them.  Put the wow on your vehicle.  But I forgot this is the first wow for Las Vegas.  Ah.  From our show.  From our show.  The show that pretty much, yeah, did come up with this concept in Boston many years ago.  You've got to think they were quite embarrassed when, you know, all these national TV shows 
[00:10:30]  were putting us on so we could talk about this great promotion, Whip Em Out Wednesday.  What do you tell your listeners after that?  You tell them.  Because you know they didn't say, hey, this is a great idea from a bunch of guys, you  know, in New York.  You tell them, no, no, it wasn't me.  I didn't do it.  I'm going to find the real originators of wow.  You just got to lie, I guess, and say, well, they promoted our show before we came to town.  Because now all those wow stickers out there and those wow signs, it's for us. 
[00:11:00]  All right.  And real fast, WBCN in Boston, they're doing a wow sticker stop today.  At Newberry Comics in Burlington, Mass., they're going to have those huge wow bus signs.  The last of the huge wow bus signs.  So what time are they going to be giving them?  All right.  At 5 o'clock, Newberry Comics in Burlington, Mass., from 5 to whenever, wow stickers and  wow bus signs.  We want to see a huge crowd up there.  They'll give out other things as well, okay?  And before we take our first break and get into the show, we have Yankee tickets to give 
[00:11:30]  away for tonight's game in a mere few hours.  Ben, grab the mic.  Did Earl leave yet?  No.  See, we can't announce it then because they're going to.  Here he is.  Hey, guys, it's Earl.  Earl.  Earl, you should have left before we announced this.  They told me to come in here.  Because now people are going to.  No, he told me to come in here.  I didn't.  I was trapped in an elevator.  Leave me alone.  That was Monday.  All right.  Here's the deal.  We will announce how you can get Yankee tickets next, okay? 
[00:12:00]  How is you being stuck in the elevator, Earl?  Five minutes.  No big deal.  You were stuck in an elevator?  But Earl was then crowing and blowing his own horn.  Who were you stuck in the elevator with?  I was stuck with John Rossi and Mary.  Mary lost her mind.  She was in the fetal position.  Mary freaked out.  She freaked out.  So you're stuck in the elevator here in our building.  Well, this tone went off.  It was like this high-pitched squeal that would not stop.  Oh, my goodness. 
[00:12:30]  And we're just sitting there.  And everyone's like, just make it stop.  So I pulled the alarm.  Mary was freaking out because she thought,  or trapped in an elevator with you.  Death from boredom is a reality.  And quite the possibility.  They found the people victims of boredom.  Mary, you really freaked out because you were stuck in the elevator?  All right.  First of all, there were four of us.  It was really hot in there.  We're all freaking out.  Everybody was freaking out except Earl.  Earl was like, just stay cool.  Just stay cool.  Stay calm.  And all he kept doing was touching the button and going, hello? 
[00:13:00]  Hello?  The only reason we got out is because the two guys from promotions freaked out to the point  where they pulled the doors open.  Yeah.  All right.  You guys are alive.  Earl was cooler than the other side of the coin.  Is that what he said?  He's cooler than security.  So he gets out of the elevator, which is stuck for five minutes.  20 minutes.  20 minutes.  And then he starts going, I remained cool.  Like he's tooting his own horn.  How does everyone stop?  Because everyone else is like losing their money.  I was cool as the other side of the coin, he says. 
[00:13:30]  If the rest of us hadn't lost our mind, we would have been in there like a good hour  and a half.  Security was completely clueless.  When we were downstairs leaving the building about a half an hour after we got stuck, they  were all like, oh, you got out?  Well, when we were leaving, the guy to fix the elevator showed up.  Oh, my God.  Imagine this conversation stuck in the elevator.  So, Earl, is the mayor going to present you with something for remaining cool under such  pressure?  Cold, calm, and collected. 
[00:14:00]  Earl gets a medal.  Hardly.  All right, we better take a break here.  Great.  That's a great little story there.  Thanks, Earl.  All right, we're going to give away Yankee tickets for the game tonight.  We got a couple pairs to give away.  We'll tell you how you can win them next for the New York audience, okay?  Right.  Quick break.  Here's Matt Lauer talking about Whippin' Mount Wednesday on the Jay Leno Show.  Yes.  Talking about us, Vegas.  How about the woman that took her shirt off in the line?  Which I hear you've had a little fun.  We had a lot of fun with it.  Did that shock you?  Well, you know what it was? 
[00:14:30]  We were outside, and if you've seen the 8.30 in the show every morning, the camera pans  the crowd outside.  And what I do is, since I can't see where the camera is sometimes, I look at the monitor.  And I'm standing there, it happened to be with Ann Curry.  Katie was in Philadelphia at the time.  And I'm looking at the monitor, and I see the people go by.  And normally, you know, hi, Mom.  Hey, Kansas.  Go Jayhawks.  And all of a sudden, the camera goes by, and this woman looks at the camera and goes.  And my first thought was it was one of those kind of like plastic pieces that you wear  on Halloween, you know, that they weren't real.  They might have been, yeah, when you think about it.  And then after like 45 seconds of staring at it, I said, you know, those are real. 
[00:15:00]  And, you know, she had written the word wow on her stomach, which apparently is, you  know, W.O.W. stands for the stupid radio station promotion in New York called Whip  Them Out Wednesdays.  And so, she whipped them out.  Well, it's not a stupid promotion anymore.  They just got a lot of publicity.  I think it actually said powwow, but gravity had covered the, uh.  Really?  The top word.  Oh!  But what's weird about it is, think about this lady.  At some point during her day, that day, she had to get in front of a mirror and say, 
[00:15:30]  yeah, these are ready for national television.  And I've got to be honest with you, speak as one boob man to another, these were not  that great.  I mean, I've seen a lot better boobs than these.  And yet, she exposes them on a morning show.  But you know what's good in, what, six years of having the outdoor studio, I think that's  the first, there was one other little weird thing, but that's the first time anyone has,  you know, gone.  Don't say that now.  But, you know, we have, most of the people are great.  They're very wholesome people.  But there's a car with a wow next to me. 
[00:16:00]  Without your cans, pull out your fun bags.  What are you waiting for?  Do it.  Do it now.  I'm willing.  You look fabulous.  O.B. and Anthony.  We love seeing boobs.  Well done.  Days of the New, hang on to this, their latest single.  We're back with the O.B. and Anthony show.  Days of the New, helping us out with the 100th show in syndication for Philadelphia.  A week from today is the big day. 
[00:16:30]  The whole gang heading down to Philadelphia.  It's going to be an all-day thing.  Days of the New is going to end the show.  We've got Octane, a local band.  We've got Stephen Lynch.  Norton's going to do some comedy on stage.  We were talking to Karen.  Karen Buck from the radio station down there in Philly.  Marketing director.  She's great.  She goes, you guys sure you want to do comedy?  Oh, boy.  Oh, boy.  We have found in the past that comedy doesn't really work. 
[00:17:00]  Oh, boy.  Trust me.  Who did they have?  I can only imagine.  They had somebody kind of popular.  Oh, they did?  Ben's writing it down.  And he will hold it up to me.  And this is the comedy that didn't work?  Oh, one of those guys.  Let's see, man.  Trust me.  Norton's going to kill.  Yeah.  I don't care how many people are at the electric factory.  When Norton starts spewing his jokes, the stuff he can't say on the air,  the place is going to lose their effing minds. 
[00:17:30]  I guarantee our comedy will work on that stage.  Yeah, don't worry about it.  Don't worry about it.  Also, where's the list of things we've got going on?  We have the Freak Box.  Oh, cool.  All right.  Rich Voss is going to be there.  Norton.  Stephen Lynch playing some of his tunes.  Nice.  Matter of fact, we're going to play the one he did for us yesterday in a little while.  Well, I don't even want to say it because it gives away the joke.  But Lynch did a new song for us yesterday, and we'll replay it today.  Also, I said Voss. 
[00:18:00]  Anthony's old band Rotgut's going to be performing.  We are.  That's what I'm hearing.  I don't want to.  Oh, you don't have to then.  Yeah.  We've got a lot going on.  Brother Joe will play the sea song and maybe a Patty Duke version of something.  All right.  Well, Brother Joe will get up there and make people chuckle without a doubt.  We have the fire-breathing twin chicks coming up on stage, and we're going to have a Stars  and Stripes bikini contest.  Grand prize, $1,000.  So, ladies, we're going to be asking for you on the stage saying, hey, sign up for this 
[00:18:30]  contest.  $1,000 you can walk away with.  And you don't even need a Stars and Stripes bikini if you don't have one because we just  got a whole S-load of bikinis today from a company.  That'll help because a lot of girls probably don't want to come out with the bikini on  underneath or something or don't have them.  They're put away, maybe.  Ladies, if you have one or if you want to get creative with your Stars and Stripes bikini,  by all means, go for it.  But I'm just saying, if you go there and you're not ready and all of a sudden you have a few  in you and you say, all right, I'm in on this contest.  There you go.  We're bringing bikinis, so. 
[00:19:00]  A few in you.  It's going to be an unbelievable day.  It starts at WYSP as we have lunch with the salespeople.  It's amazing how Karen Buck doesn't realize how awful that's going to be.  Yeah.  Do we have to do the meeting with salespeople?  We found in the past that doesn't work.  It all depends how many people show up outside the studio to hang with us because then we'll  have an excuse.  Then we're going to do the radio show with a bunch of people stopping by the studio.  Can we send, like, Voss and someone else in in our place?  We can do that.  Just say that that was us. 
[00:19:30]  Voss and Norton will go in for the sales meeting and we'll just, like, slip out somewhere.  Oh, bikinis, courtesy of James at designhers.com.  How do the bikinis look when you open up the box, Rick?  They look pretty good.  Yeah.  They're all red, white, and blue, Stars and Stripes.  That looks pretty good.  He said that if he needs more, we can just ask him.  That's going to be the showstopper.  How do they fit, Rick?  Are they nice, though, bikinis?  A little tighter on the sack.  Are they nice?  They're not like old lady bikinis, right?  No, no. 
[00:20:00]  He sends some thongs.  He sends some with the shorts.  You know, they're not a little tight shorts.  Yes.  And then some of the regulars, so.  Cool.  Very good.  And then, of course, you know, we do the radio show and then we head off to the electric  factory for a full-blown road show.  Like full-blown AIDS.  All the stuff we just mentioned, we'll be on that stage and much, much, much, much more.  Yes.  Anthony, you know, a lot of our Philly listeners bitching and complaining that, first of all,  it's not easy to get the tickets.  Yeah.  Second of all, they're not really promoting the show.  That's what I've heard. 
[00:20:30]  And when they do, they're talking about Days of the New more than they're talking about  you and I.  This is our road show.  Days of the New playing at the road show, sure.  But, you know, this is our way of getting down into Philly and kind of showing Philly  what we're all about when we come down to see you live.  Well, we got our hands on the promo that Philly is running for our appearance down there in  Philadelphia next Wednesday.  You want to hear it?  Yeah.  All right.  This is what they're running, which proves our point from yesterday. 
[00:21:00]  All right.  I don't really hear much mentions of you and I and us coming down to Philly.  No?  No.  No.  Listen to this.  The music.  The majesty.  Days of the New.  Cause I found a found reason I only.  Days of the New.  Days of the New.  Days of the New for one night only.  A YSB concert event.  This Wednesday, October 17th at the Electric Factory.  Holding after you.  Days of the New.  I'm the only trying to feel. 
[00:21:30]  Plus Philadelphia's own Octave.  Days of the New.  Wednesday night, October 17th at the Electric Factory.  Doors open at 7 p.m.  Don't miss Days of the New for a YSB concert event.  Plus special guest, Opie and Anthony.  Days of the New.  Oh, great.  You're kidding.  Come on.  What is that?  Come on.  What the hell is that?  You're kidding, right?  That's not the ad they're running.  Days of the New.  The music.  It's all about Days of the New.  No, I guess they don't need us.  So we will not show up a week from today. 
[00:22:00]  We don't need to be there.  Obviously.  Special guest, Opie and Anthony.  Days of the New.  I told them Spinal Top and then the Puppet Show.  And then the Puppet Show.  They'll squeeze us in on the stage.  Is that really the ad they're running?  I think we'll come out just to say, hey, hey, are you guys ready to rock?  Yeah.  Electric Factory.  Let's hear you.  Here comes Days of the New.  There you go.  Give a shout out to everyone in the sales meeting.  Yeah.  That was great.  Is that really the ad they're running?  Yeah.  Norman? 
[00:22:30]  That is ridiculous.  Come on.  Actually, you want to know the truth?  That's the comedic stylings of our program director down there, Tim Sabian.  Can't figure out why he doesn't have a radio show.  Because, oh, that's really funny.  Didn't he call Ben and was all excited about pulling a goof on us?  Yeah.  Pulling a little gag on us?  Yeah.  I got it.  We'll make a promo sound like we're just promoting Days of the New.  I think Tim's wasting his talent.  He really needs to do a radio show, don't you think, Norton? 
[00:23:00]  Yeah.  That Tim's a card.  That was quite funny.  That's quite the shenanigans to be pulling on us.  Yeah.  He really got everyone talking in the market.  Got us all worried.  Yeah, look at everybody.  That can't be real.  And then he's calling Ben over and over again going, I can't wait, man.  These guys are going to lose it when they hear this.  You've got to swear you're not going to say anything, man.  Right, right.  That's what he's going to say.  What are we, retards staring at a Ferris wheel?  What did he think? 
[00:23:30]  We were going to hear that and go, oh, that must be with the running.  Especially because I'll be in my day.  Days of the New.  So, like, we'll play you the version we did of something like that for Dice when we were  goofing on Dice.  Remember that?  Yeah.  We did it as a goof, but it wasn't like really trying to get away with it like Tim is.  Yeah.  And I bought it.  This is the ad.  He's like, I can't wait.  Well, you are a retard staring at a Ferris wheel.  You are.  He goes, I can't wait for those guys to play it.  It's going to be unbelievable.  So, oh, this just in Tim Sabian also runs Prep Burger. 
[00:24:00]  I did not know.  Prep Burger.  Yeah.  Yeah, here's the fake Dice commercial.  Yeah, see, we did this.  Was this for the garden show?  Yeah.  Yeah.  We brought Dice to the garden and it was crazy.  It's about a year ago now.  Right.  A year ago.  And we messed with Dice by playing this, you know, for him because the Dice show was presented  by Ant and I.  We're now concert promoters.  Right.  I don't know how that happened, but we are.  Everything.  Surgeons.  We do it all.  So, you know, Dice thought, you know, he was getting top billing and stuff and we played 
[00:24:30]  this for him and he lost his mind.  Dice!  Dice!  Dice!  Dice!  The Beacon Theater sold out in record time because the building was too small.  Now, by unprecedented demand, October 26th at Madison Square Garden.  O.P.  And Anthony.  Coming to the only building in New York City big enough to hold this concert.  The only comedian who had to have the Bill of Rights emblazoned on his jacket to avoid  The only comedian to be banned by MTV forever.  O.P.  O.P.  O.P. and Anthony.  I'm over him now!  October 26th at Madison Square Garden. 
[00:25:00]  O.P. and Anthony.  O.P. and Anthony.  O.P. and Anthony.  O.P. and Anthony.  And special guest superstar Andrew Dice-Clay.  O.P. and Anthony.  O.P. and Anthony.  O.P. and Anthony.  O.P. and Anthony.  O.P. and Anthony.  O.P. and Anthony.  O.P. and Anthony.  O.P. and Anthony.  O.P. and Anthony.  O.P. and Anthony.  O.P. and Anthony.  O.P. and Anthony.  O.P. and Anthony.  O.P. and Anthony. 
[00:25:30]  O.P. and Anthony.  O.P. and Anthony.  O.P. and Anthony.  O.P. and Anthony.  O.P. and Anthony.  O.P. and Anthony.  It was obviously a joke.  We knew Dice wasn't going to believe that that was the ad that was running.  But Tim was all psyched about his little gag.  How many times did he call you, man?  Like four or five times?  Oh, I can't wait.  When are they going to do what you think?  I bet they get all mad.  He was probably like, up all late last night.  I bet it plays out like this.  I bet they play it, then get all mad and start yelling at me, and I'll have the last laugh. 
[00:26:00]  I'll call up and tell them that isn't the promo that's running it.  I'll have one.  By the way, because there are stupid people out there, Dice is not coming to the guard in October 20th.  Right, people start buying tickets.  God, that was almost a year ago, huh?  Woo-ha!  Bet you Tim called all his friends.  Guys, turn on the radio and put on your laughing hats.  I'm going to play the garden on the night the Yankees win the World Series.  That was real smart.  What a stroke of luck that was, huh? 
[00:26:30]  Game five of the World Series, and we're helping Dice at the guard.  It's still been great.  I spent most of the time in the back watching the game.  Yeah.  So, there you go.  Tim's a little chuckle today.  Tim Sabian.  What a card.  What a character.  What a pistol.  Can't wait for his next attempt at comedy.  He's quite the, what would you call him, maybe a firecracker.  Quite the firecracker.  Well, you would say firecracker.  I would say cut up.  But, you know, it's the same thing, basically.  All right, we have to give away the Yankee tickets for tonight.  Yes. 
[00:27:00]  We got two pairs of tickets to see the Yankees, courtesy of Budweiser and Major League Baseball.  Winner gets one pair of tickets and a jacket.  Winner's guest receives gift pack.  Is this true?  Did you see him, Adam?  Because I didn't.  Tim Sabian was at the Friars Club.  When?  Earlier today.  I didn't.  Was that the guy that brought us the food?  His comedy stylings are so good now that he's become a friar.  Wow.  I didn't know that.  I think he was the guy that hangs out in the bathroom that gives you the cologne and stuff. 
[00:27:30]  Takes the comb out of the blue fluid.  Right.  That's not a mint.  He turns the water on and expects you to tip him two bucks.  I hate men's room attendance.  That is just the worst, most awful job.  And, look, I've done this for so many years.  I can relieve myself, and then I can wash my hands and even dry them.  I know where the towels are.  Why am I being extorted to paying this guy money to dole out the stuff that's for free? 
[00:28:00]  There's two kinds of guys.  Either the big guy that you're really scared of, or there's the little guy with the sad eyes,  and you feel like a dirt bag if you don't give a hand.  Right, because you just know he really needs the buck.  Yeah.  I usually give the money to the step-and-fetch-it guys.  You know, they go, thank you, sir, thank you.  Here, you need more soaps, sir.  More soaps.  The guy's like right out of the 20s or something.  You know, I'm giving him some cash.  But the big guys, it's like, get yourself a job hauling some concrete or something.  Good move.  I'm going to move him in a dirty hand. 
[00:28:30]  Boy, it's a good thing you pulled that paper towel out of there.  My fingertips are wet, and occasionally it might tear as you try to get it out,  and you sit there and waste, could be in the tens of seconds, trying to get the next towel.  If they want to help us in that situation, they should have a really nice stripper.  Oh, yeah.  And also, they're not expecting it.  You know, you're turning on the water wash in your hands.  Next thing you know, the guy offers, you know, this girl to flash you real fast.  Would you like a towel?  I'm going to need a lot of them. 
[00:29:00]  Imagine you just hang it out to go relieve yourself,  and her hand just comes around and holds it for you.  You're tipping.  You're tipping.  Do you know what?  No, you need another one.  You need the tap girl.  Oh, the girl that just tap, tap, tap gets the couple of little ones.  There you go.  So your undies don't get stained.  Oh, tap girl.  Tap girl.  I'm wearing khakis.  I need the tap girl.  Doink, doink, doink.  You need a tap girl.  I don't mind the attendant doing it.  I had one guy come over, and there was a little fella.  Here's the fuck, champ. 
[00:29:30]  All right.  We have to give these Yankee tickets away.  Here's the deal.  Now, we have sent Black Earl loose somewhere in Manhattan.  Oh, no.  Oh, no.  He's lost already.  Your job is to find Earl.  He has the Yankee tickets.  Look for a black man asking directions.  Okay.  Just in case you've never met Earl.  Hello.  He has all black on from head to toe, even his shoes.  Black Yankee cap.  Black Yankees cap. 
[00:30:00]  Black shades on.  It's hard to tell that it's a black Yankee cap because the logo's even in black.  Right.  All right.  I can't believe he stole the van and the tickets.  So, you find Earl.  You're going to the Yankee game tonight, okay?  Nicey nice, huh?  And I'll help you out a little bit.  We're on 57th and 7th here in Manhattan.  He's within 10 blocks of the radio station.  Oh, he is.  Mm-hmm.  Isn't that right in the area of ground zero now?  10 blocks?  One point.  How close are we? 
[00:30:30]  1.2.  1.2 miles?  1.1.  1.1, I think we are, yeah.  Yeah, a little over a mile, so.  All right.  All right.  What the heck is this?  Timmy, you're next on the O.P. and Anthony Show.  How's it going?  All right, Timmy.  I'm on Hempstead Turnpike in Franklin Square.  There are girls wowing anyone going by in red, white.  They're all painted up in red, white, and blue.  And they're wowing everyone?  Everybody.  And they're holding up a sign, God bless O.N.A. in America.  Come on.  Patriotic wow.  That's it.  Hempstead Turnpike, Franklin Avenue, Franklin Square.  And they're just wowing everyone that comes by? 
[00:31:00]  Everybody who honks for them.  Now, that's patriotism, my friends.  Absolutely.  God bless you guys, anointing you're a god.  All right.  Someone get a picture of that so we can put it on the website.  Absolutely.  All right.  Thank you.  That's cool.  I think I had a tough time home.  I think I had to go by there on the way home.  That guy's having a tough time hanging up his phone.  Hey, Jay, what's going on?  Hey, what's up, O.N.A.?  Hey.  You guys catch the top 20 list for these towel heads across the way?  Yeah, yeah. 
[00:31:30]  The FBI.  They're like complete sentences.  What?  The most wanted list?  It's like four paragraphs.  They're names.  The most wanted list?  Yeah, the most wanted list that they put out today.  They don't look like names.  They look like sentences.  Dude, they're like four paragraphs.  Pull up the pictures if you can get them on the website.  Yeah.  It takes like two lines, each name.  It's like Al-Hameb-Aqam-El-El.  Should be easy to find.  Yeah.  All right.  And I just want to say, Norton, you're one funny MF.  Thank you, buddy.  All right.  All right, Jay.  Thank you.  An MF.  Speaking of other stuff that's been going on with that, how about this? 
[00:32:00]  Chicago, three Saudi men removed from a United Airlines flight after they mistakenly  tried to open an exit window to get air circulating during the boarding procedure.  What?  This is a jet aircraft.  Let's just sit in our seats.  And yeah, they didn't understand English.  They thought for some reason if it got a little stuffy in the aircraft.  Right.  And they were by the emergency exit, which I just want to smack the flight attendants in  the face.  How do you put Saudi people by the exit, by the emergency exit? 
[00:32:30]  You don't.  You corral them in the back of the aircraft and keep the marshal there watching them.  Round them up.  But they were right there.  And then what do they start doing?  Fiddling with the handle.  They're going to open it up like it's an old rambler.  Crank the window down to get some fresh air circulating.  If I saw that, I would have to beat the crap out of them.  You would.  You'd have to beat the crap out of them.  Absolutely.  I'd put my hand on their heads and start them up like lawnmowers with the therapists.  Yeah.  Indiana Jones. 
[00:33:00]  It's like the plane in Indiana Jones.  Chowchee's airline there.  Where they all jumped out.  What did they think?  It was one of those chickens on board.  Where you just, you got the window.  What do you do?  You open the door even.  You could open the door for some fresh air.  No, it's an aircraft.  Goodbye.  If I was a Saudi person and I'm on an airplane, I'm sitting with my hands on my kneecaps straight  up and not saying a word and not doing anything.  I'm wearing a Yankees hat.  I'm wearing a flag around me.  Hell no.  Please. 
[00:33:30]  I'd go on the flight in a straight jacket.  That's even better.  I'd walk right on the plane in a straight jacket.  Look, you don't have to worry about me.  Imagine being a guy, you know, you're Ahmed, Achmal, whatever, and you have to take a leak  and you're going up to the bathroom in the front.  What do you do?  I would just start fiddling with my zipper immediately.  Pull your junk out so they know you're going to take a leak.  Not even you start talking.  Hello, I'm sorry to interrupt the movie, but I have to be.  I don't care.  Send a tap girl with me.  She could watch me pee.  Don't beat me, silly. 
[00:34:00]  I really just have to pee.  That's all.  Don't beat me.  Shave your beard.  Take off the turban.  Call yourself Hispanic.  That's what you could do that, too.  I'm sure a lot of people are.  Joe, that's the problem.  That's what those guys did, basically.  Yeah, they look like your regular people.  They look like regular guys.  They look like those filthy animals that are over there in Afghanistan.  Mario, what's going on?  Hey, I want the tickets.  I know where he is.  Yeah.  His lazy ass is behind his desk in his office.  Now he actually left the ticket. 
[00:34:30]  He actually left the building.  Oh, come on.  Come on.  I know he's there.  Don't lie.  He agreed on doing something for us today.  It was nice of him.  Oh, damn.  He's in the lobby with a sign.  Come on.  Help me out.  All right.  Very good.  I think someone found Earl already, though.  Let's go to Rich.  Rich, what's going on?  I found Earl.  Did you really?  Yes, I did.  I'm standing right next to the guy.  Hey, give Earl the phone.  Give Earl the phone?  Yeah.  Oh, they want to talk to you.  Yeah.  Hello?  He found Earl. 
[00:35:00]  Earl.  You.  Boy, you didn't do that well.  It didn't take long at all.  Earl, I hope you're further than just outside the building.  I hope you gave it a little effort.  I'm in Columbus Circle.  All right.  You went two blocks.  That's not bad.  Are you drowsy?  Are you going to come back and nap?  Do you need us to come pick you up?  You want a cab fare?  Earl.  You fell asleep.  Earl.  Yes.  All right.  So what happened?  You went to Columbus Circle and this guy came running up on you? 
[00:35:30]  What?  Yeah.  I'm one of New York's finest, actually.  Ah, well.  Nice.  See, that was a coincidence.  See?  It's called racial profile.  It's called he stopped about five other Earls before he got to you.  He figured he could help his quota and get some tickets.  Oh, hey.  A little racial profiling got him some tickets.  How about that?  Hey, Rick.  So, Rich, you got a pair, and you have another pair, right?  Yeah.  I'm going to move from this location. 
[00:36:00]  Yeah.  You better start running.  Hurry up, Earl.  Yes.  All right.  Thanks, Earl.  Thank you, guys.  Do you have a phone on you?  Yes, I do.  All right.  Why don't you call us as you're running away, okay?  Because it's only going to take seconds now for the other people to find you.  Okay.  All right.  There goes Earl.  Earl's starting to run.  Right.  Oh, my God.  Congrats to Rich.  He wins a pair of tickets to the game tonight courtesy of Budweiser and Major League Baseball.  He gets a pair of tickets and a jacket. 
[00:36:30]  Nice.  All right.  New York's finest.  That's good.  All right.  Jim, what's going on?  Yo, fellas.  I just got tickets to your show in Philly.  Oh, cool.  Oh, I'm so psyched.  I had a bag for them, but I got them.  How'd you get them?  I called the radio station.  I called YSP.  Yeah.  And I literally begged for them to the DJ, kissing his ass, telling him he's the best and  all that kind of fun stuff.  And he says, okay, you can have them.  All right.  That never hurts.  Good.  So, yeah.  So, I got them.  I'm so psyched.  Norton, you rock. 
[00:37:00]  Thanks, man.  I can't wait to see you guys up there.  It's going to be an absolute blast.  My wife asked me today.  She's like, do I have the flash?  I said, I think you do.  Nah.  We'll find enough women that'll do it because they want to.  We don't force ladies to do any of that crap.  Nice.  All right.  That's why it works so nicely for us.  Very cool.  All right, Jim.  Thanks.  Thanks, guys.  Let's play the Stephen Lynch song as we go to break here from yesterday.  All right.  Lynch is going to be performing a lot of his hits down there in Philly a week from today.  Maybe this one will make the set list for Philly.  Who knows? 
[00:37:30]  I personally hope the abortion song makes it.  Yeah, that's a good one.  That was a big hit at the Beacon Show with Jay Moore the other night.  I think we played that once here on our airwaves and it got dumped out of.  It's just so heinous.  I don't think there's any way to play it.  Can we play it?  It's such a despicable tune.  I mean, Madonna's in the news.  She had 11 of them, so she'll play it.  Wow.  Wait, really?  Well, that's what they're saying in the post.  Really?  11 abortions.  We'll have the story next, I guess.  Jesus Christ.  The last one must have been, Doc, catch! 
[00:38:00]  Earl.  Yo.  What's up?  I never got to the corner.  I didn't even get to the corner.  Oh, what's your name?  Elliot.  Elliot.  What?  Yeah, Elliot.  He was like, you were out of.  I never even got to the corner.  What's his name?  Elliot.  Oh, Elliot.  Oh, Elliot.  Okay.  Is he an American person?  Yes, he looks very American.  All right.  I'm glad to know that we got people listening to us today in New York.  Yeah, I was just like, when you told me to run, I started running, got to the corner. 
[00:38:30]  He even met me at the corner.  All right, cool.  Well, that's it for the Yankee tickets.  Earl has no more, so leave him alone, okay?  Yeah, leave me alone.  All right.  Thank you, Earl.  Thank you, guys.  All right.  There he goes.  Elliot.  You know what?  Let's tell people he does have Yankee tickets.  Yeah.  There it is.  Underwear.  Very good, Norton.  All right.  As we're going to break, Stephen Lynch debuted a new song on our show yesterday, and it went  something like this.  No, the other one.  Yeah.  We'll say the abortion one for when we're talking about Madonna next. 
[00:39:00]  Here's the one Lynch did yesterday for the first time.  Let's get a little harmonica.  I got my 12-sided die, and I'm ready to roll with a wizard and my goblin crew. 
[00:39:30]  My friends are coming over to my mom's basement, bringing Funyuns in the Mountain Dew.  I got a big broad sword made out of cardboard, and that stereo's a pumping Zeppelin.  It's that time of the night.  We turn on the black light.  Let the dungeons and the dragons begin.  It's D&D fighting with the legends of yore.  It's D&D never kissed a lady before. 
[00:40:00]  Nope.  Woo!  All right.  Take it home.  Now, the Lord of the Rings, the Dark Crystal, and things, we use these as a reference tool.  And when we put on our cloaks and tell warlock jokes, we're the coolest kids at the school.  No, we're not. 
[00:40:30]  Now, Tack's a real bastard, but a fair dungeon master.  He's got hit points and charisma to lend.  And I rehearse in my room, or what I call the dragon suit, when I'm not out with my girlfriend.  It's D&D.  Whoa, whoa, whoa.  You got a girlfriend?  Yeah.  Yeah.  No.  It's D&D.  Warriors who terrify.  It's D&D.  Virgins till the day we...

It's Whip Them Out Wednesday.  A great day for that. 
[00:42:30]  Ladies, if you see a wow on the back of someone's car, that means they really would like you to flash them.  Lift those babies out.  So help us out a little bit.  You don't have to if you don't want to.  No one's going to force you, but it would be greatly appreciated, okay?  It's nicer when it's an offering rather than a demand.  Exactly.  Yeah.  Adam Ferrara in the studio from The Job.  Is that what it is now?  You give them that like it's Adam Ferrara from The Job.  Oh, yeah.  From the Dennis Leary hit TV show, The Job.  What happened to Adam Ferrara? 
[00:43:00]  Oh, the Hospitaliano guy from the Olive Garden commercial.  Adam's been on our show for many years.  We used to, you know, give the big intro.  Adam Ferrara from Social Studies.  Oh, God.  Remember that?  Oh, man.  Adam Ferrara from Adam.  Oh.  Adam Ferrara from He Slept With My Sister.  Yeah, that one, too.  That was the first credit.  We just have some great intros for you.  But the latest is Adam Ferrara from The Job with Dennis Leary and the gang.  Adam is one of those rolling people in the Olive Garden commercials where they find some Italian, 
[00:43:30]  some young aspiring Italian actor that's not willing to give a little oral.  Rink-a-wash.  Rink-a-wash for a spot on a commercial.  And, yeah, you fit the bill.  You're a Dago.  So they threw you in front of there and you had to say,  Hospitaliano.  Yes, I did.  I like when he was Adam Ferrara and his college band Date Rape.  Oh, yeah.  You had a band named Date Rape?  Oh, yeah.  For about ten minutes.  Sure.  Sublime ripped you off, man. 
[00:44:00]  Fine song, by the way.  Craig.  When do I get to pull out the Cue Me Your Brothers photo album of stupid things you did in your  That's all right.  You know, we were all trying there, Adam.  Did I still have Hungry Hearts tapes?  Nice.  What's Hungry Hearts?  That was a bar.  Hungry Hearts is this bar that used to be, I don't know where it was,  but it was a bar they used to play.  Dessons, which is now a post office.  It stunk.  Just sucked.  We have a call coming in.  You played on a boat.  From L.A.  There's nothing wrong with playing on a boat. 
[00:44:30]  Megan.  Yeah, but it was a 12-foot-year-old boat.  Hey, Megan, what's up?  Hello?  Yeah, what's up?  What's up?  Hi.  I was...  Yeah.  Yeah.  It's okay.  You could speak.  This is Earl.  Megan?  Megan.  She's listening to herself.  Megan.  No, she can't be.  Megan.  Megan, you're calling from WB in California, right?  Yeah.  Well, that's not Megan.  Who are you?  She's freaking out. 
[00:45:00]  She doesn't want to be on the radio.  Hi.  Who are you?  I'm Joe.  Hey, Joe.  Are there any other voices living in your head?  What does Megan want?  Yeah, why are you guys calling?  I'd like to talk to Megan.  Can Megan come out?  We're calling from an advertising agency in San Francisco, and we're trying to get some  information.  What does WB mean?  Oh.  Advertising.  Man, you blow away those stereotypes, my friend.  Thanks.  What do you need to know?  We all know on the radio. 
[00:45:30]  What do you guys want to know?  What do we want to know?  Tell them what you want to know.  We want to know where you guys are syndicated at.  We're syndicated from New York.  New York.  We got that part.  Would you put the guy back on the phone, please?  Thanks.  We do our show from Chelsea.  You ever been to Chelsea?  It's Banff House Wednesday.  You ever been to New York?  No.  Oh.  Oh, you'd love Chelsea.  You'd love the village. 
[00:46:00]  Really?  It's beautiful.  Yeah.  It's a smorgasbord of mules.  That's it.  Do you like the mule, sir?  Yeah.  Huh?  You guys are funny.  Do you like the mule?  No.  It's great stuff, the mule.  You would love the village where you can go jogging along the west side and see scantily  clad young men walking their shih tzus.  Their shih tzus?  In their little shorts.  Their wedgie shorts.  Do you have a shih tzu? 
[00:46:30]  No, I don't.  The only place in the country that actually has knee pad rentals.  That's great.  All right.  So what do you guys need to know?  Um, where you guys are syndicated.  Like, do you guys run on any other stations in the country?  Yeah, about 15 others.  Yeah.  Really?  We're getting there.  Yeah.  Yeah.  We're on...  Is there someone that has...  Like, you guys can fax us a list or something?  We're on a station in San Francisco.  Really?  Yeah.  You didn't even know that?  You've got to be about five miles from the antenna, but we are syndicated there. 
[00:47:00]  Yeah.  What are the call letters?  Uh, I don't even know.  They're too small for us to bother with.  I see.  I don't think we've ever had a call from San Francisco.  Really?  No, it's, uh, KYCY.  KYCY.  1550 AM.  Just remember KY.  KY.  Yeah.  Yeah, thanks.  I remember that.  It's been too hard.  Anything else, my fine friend?  No, we're cool.  How are things in San Francisco?  Nice? 
[00:47:30]  Yeah, they're actually pretty nice today.  How's the night like out there?  Pretty lame.  Pretty lame?  What does an advertising executive do to blow off steam?  Until I get a kick out of the segment.  You've got to call steam.  Really?  Steam, I'm ready.  Yeah.  So, what is...  All right.  Sorry.  All right, we'll let you go.  Are you dressed like you or Megan today?  Am I?  Oh, I'm wearing Megan's dress today, actually.  Yeah.  There you go.  Yeah.  No surprise.  When did you come out?  When did I come out?  Yeah.  Yeah.  About two, three years ago. 
[00:48:00]  That's it?  Yeah.  Wow.  So, it's all new.  How old a guy are you?  Wow, we nailed it.  26?  Mm-hmm.  So, you came out when you were, what, 24?  Yeah, about that.  So, you're still a young gay guy out on the town going at it.  That's it.  That's rocks.  Laying in the sun like a young Indian brave.  Get it all now, because there's nothing sadder than an older gay gentleman.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Queens don't age well.  No, they don't.  Look at Elizabeth.  Do you have good abs, sir?  Do I have good abs?  Yeah.  You got the six-pack?  You got the six-pack working? 
[00:48:30]  Yeah.  I'm a gym bunny, thanks.  A gym bunny.  I never heard that.  Anything with bunny after it just, ooh, sends shivers up my spine.  Yeah.  Mm.  What do you look like?  Sir, do your farts still make noise?  Yeah.  Funny.  Because I become gay doesn't mean I'm not a guy.  Right.  Absolutely.  That's what I say.  Hey, we enjoy the gay guys.  We're friends with gay guys. 
[00:49:00]  Absolutely.  We have a few gay friends, my friend.  Your friend?  Yeah.  We got a...  You ever see Mario Cantone?  No.  He's a hysterical comic.  Funniest gay comedian you'll ever see.  And he's not like a gay comedian.  He doesn't do all gay materials.  I mean, just a guy.  Funnier than Charles Nelson Reilly.  Mm-hmm.  There you go.  You like Charles Nelson Reilly?  No, really.  Oh, ho.  Rip Taylor?  He's funnier than Louie Anderson.  Ugh.  Who is just despicable.  How much do you think he has to pay for a fine, young, gay gentleman like yourself?  Yeah, on the Louie school, you get a fortune. 
[00:49:30]  Wouldn't even want to begin to think about that.  I bet.  You imagine that?  The young gay hustler comes over his house, knows that a lot of money is going to be spent  by Louie, but then he opens the door and there's a big, fat, naked Louie Anderson.  Hi, I was just here to hopefully get some gay companionship.  You know, it's making up for a childhood of horror with my father beating me with whiskey  bottles and whatnot, and the children at school making fun of me, you know, how to eat because 
[00:50:00]  of my low self-esteem and my enabling twat of a mother.  But now you're here, and we're going to play Gay Call Guy Feud!  All right, the first question up is, what does Louie Anderson want in the balloon knot?  What does Louie Anderson, we've all polled our audience for this survey, what does Louie  want?  Do you have an answer, sir?  Just hit the buzzer.  Is it funny? 
[00:50:30]  You don't want to play?  Play Family Feud now.  Let's see your junk!  There it is!  That's your junk!  That's what Louie wants in his balloon knot.  Thank you for playing the feud, now pull down your pants and suck it.  I love it.  You know, it's just a whole lifetime of horror until I got enough money to buy a young gentleman  like yourself.  Come on in.  Come on in and taste of my from under cheese. 
[00:51:00]  It's hard to watch.  I'm talking about juggling balls.  Juggling balls.  Of course, like a seal.  I love the circus boys.  We lost our friend.  Where'd he go?  I hope he didn't get insulted.  Oh.  Louie Anderson.  Hello, guys.  Hey.  Hey, Louie.  How you doing?  Well, guys, I'm a little upset.  I hope you're flattered by my imitation, Louie.  I have to say, guys, I'm a little upset.  Why?  Well, you forgot about my real passion in life. 
[00:51:30]  What is that?  Well, as you recall, there was some negative media about me a while back concerning a black  male.  Yes.  And if you're going to disparage me about liking the big boys, I'd at the very least like it  for them to be big in the right area.  That was the black male thing.  But I thought it was black male, not black males.  Well, you see, if you ran your spell check, buddy, you'd find that there's a space. 
[00:52:00]  Oh, I didn't know that.  We thought the space was filled.  Unfortunately, not nearly enough.  That was hysterical.  Louie Anderson, a couple of years back, a story broke that he was paying money to some gay young  gentlemen not to come out in the media and say that Louie had paid him for sex, because  we all thought Louie was just straighter than straight, I guess.  Louie, Louie, it's great.  Don't try to cover up things and spend good money covering up things everyone knows anyway.  And it was all Canadian money, if you have to know. 
[00:52:30]  Ah, it's worthless crap anyway.  Okay.  Ooh.  All right, Louie.  Who is that?  All right, Louie.  Can we turn the comedy back into tragedy, please?  Comedy into tragedy is very nice.  I have to see my parents, so I better go drown my sorrows in ho-hos and chocolate milk.  Chocolate milk and ho-hos.  And my companion that I have at my house now, I bought a bird, because I just love a cockatoo.  Sorry.  Look, look, I said it right. 
[00:53:00]  Louie says it wrong.  Well, that's why you're syndicated to 15 cities.  Thank you, Louie.  Thanks.  There you go.  My favorite bird is the cockatoo, and I enjoy sitting with my favorite bird, a cockatoo.  Ooh.  Jimmy Stewart.  Hello?  Yeah.  Hello, he's got me right there.  You had me at hello.  Yeah.  How's it going? 
[00:53:30]  What's up?  I want to say something to you.  All right, Jimmy.  There's millions of women out there with anthrax.  And yesterday's show, you were saying jokes and all things about anthrax.  Yeah.  Hello?  Yeah, we're listening.  I don't think it's funny.  You don't think it's funny?  See, let me tell you something.  Yeah.  I was watching the TV.  Yeah.  And I saw, I saw a statistic.  Hello? 
[00:54:00]  Yeah.  Yeah.  Oh, there's millions of women dying.  Of anthrax?  Oh, yeah, anthrax.  And I think, that guy, that man, what's his name?  Steve.  Steve.  He writes all his songs.  Steven Lynch, yeah.  I think he should write a song saying, oh, hey, songs.  I like it, you see.  Hello?  Awesome.  Jimmy, you got to finish up here.  You're winding. 
[00:54:30]  You're just going on and on.  I don't think so, you see.  All right.  God bless America.  Thank you, Jimmy.  Thank you, Jimmy.  Who knew Jimmy Stewart would call him from the grave?  All right.  It reminds me, though, of, oh, that bit off that CD, May I Help You, Dumbass.  Right.  Remember, what's his name was in here?  We're talking to us.  Huh?  Matt Besser.  Yeah, Matt Besser.  Yeah, Matt Besser.  He did a bunch of these prank calls, and he did one as Jimmy Stewart.  Jimmy Stewart.  Basically, what, people were calling him instead of, like, a helpline for the computer? 
[00:55:00]  Yeah.  Yeah, he had a similar number to a computer helpline, so after a while of getting annoyed,  he figured he'd just start taping them and effing with the people.  And here's him as Jimmy Stewart trying to help a sad soul out there.  Tech support.  Oh, yes.  Hi.  I'm trying to, um...  Oh, what's your problem?  The problem is that every time I try to dial it, it comes up that they can't get through  and to call tech support. 
[00:55:30]  Oh, we've got to be more specific, but we're going to get through this.  We're going to turn this thing around.  Great.  Great.  Okay, so...  Did you enter your area code?  It seems to be entered already.  Right, right.  You're 2-1-2, right?  Right.  That's great.  Oh, let's just stick with me at this, and we'll turn this thing around.  Okay.  Great. 
[00:56:00]  Okay.  Now, re-enter your area code.  Oh, God.  Cancel re...  Okay.  Um, all right.  Now, the problem is that I need probably to call you on my cell phone because this isn't...  I have one line here.  All right.  Well, do you use your tool bar?  Yeah.  I guess.  What's the tool bar?  Well, you've got to use your tool bar.  That's where your icons are that we're going to have to use to fix this problem. 
[00:56:30]  But we're going to get through this later.  We've just got to keep your chin up.  Okay.  I hope so.  We're going to turn this thing around.  Great.  Okay.  So, how do...  What...  The tool bar is the thing at the bottom?  No.  Well, it could be at the top of the bar.  Do you have a Mac or all the PCs?  I have a PC.  I have a Dell.  Oh, that's good.  That's fine instrument.  I also have...  I have the disc.  You know, I have the...  The...  Born to Noble disc. 
[00:57:00]  Oh, you got the disc?  Yeah, and it's...  Oh, the disc.  Oh, that's great.  That's great.  It's not working.  Oh.  The sun's on the horizon.  We're going to turn this thing around.  Great.  Okay.  Put your disc in.  It's in.  Okay.  I'll boot up your computer.  You're going to have to restart your computer.  Okay.  So, you want me to just shut everything down here?  Oh, you have to push on a restart.  You don't have to stick with me here. 
[00:57:30]  Let's keep focused.  Where is that?  Keep focused here.  You have to write it down with a pencil.  Okay.  Where is it, though?  Oh, you don't have to turn off your computer, right?  Yeah.  You don't do it with a button, do you?  Yeah, I do.  What do you mean?  Well, there's a...  Okay.  I got to go to shut down.  That's where your tool bar is.  I got to grab a hole of it.  Okay.  Okay.  Shut down.  Restart.  I'll grab a hole of your tool bar.  I did.  You want me to...  Okay.  I have that.  Now, do you want me to go to restart? 
[00:58:00]  Okay.  You got to stay focused now.  Don't get all upset.  No, I'm not.  All right.  Now, you got to turn it off, but then you're going to say to restart.  Now, you check restart.  Okay.  You want me to press...  Okay.  I understand what you're saying.  You want me to say press shut down or restart?  Restart.  Restart.  Okay.  You got to stay focused here or you lose your cool.  No, I'm not.  I'm not.  Just take a breath there.  Keep your chin up.  Okay.  You're making me confused, though. 
[00:58:30]  So, I'm...  No.  Well, take a breath.  I'm taking a breath.  All right.  Just calm down.  Take a breath.  So, I just...  I press restart.  Yeah.  Well, calm down now.  You can't yell at me here.  I'm not...  No, I'm not yelling at you.  Okay.  I'm not yelling at you.  It's just...  You know, it's frustrating.  Yeah.  You know how...  Oh, is it re-birding?  Yes.  What's happening?  www.dell.com came up on my screen.  So, it'll be a minute or two now. 
[00:59:00]  Okay.  Making all noises and what have you.  But I left the CD in there.  The Barnes & Noble CD.  Is that good or should I take it out?  Oh, CD-ROM, right?  Yep.  I don't want to stick a music CD in there.  No, it's not a music CD.  Oh, I'm not joking.  No, I...  It'll break your computer.  Oh, no.  It's like throwing vinegar on a horse's ass. 
[00:59:30]  Really?  Well, that's a new expression on me.  I hadn't heard that one.  Excuse me?  I haven't heard that, throwing vinegar on a horse's ass before.  Oh, you know, try it.  You're going to get kicked in your head.  I guess so.  I don't spend much time around horses, so it wouldn't be something I know.  Oh, yeah.  If you don't spend much time around horses, you end up making a jackass out of your own self.  Oh, well, that could be.  Yeah.  Where are you located now?  Uh, Houston.  Oh, Houston?  Oh, okay.  Well...  Well, what? 
[01:00:00]  Well, that's...  Where are you from?  New York City.  Oh, that's right.  The 2-1-2.  Right.  So, you know, we don't have a lot of horses around.  Yeah, but you've got a lot of jackasses up there.  Well, that's for sure.  That's for sure.  We're looking at 10 inches of snow on Saturday.  Oh, I say you don't look at the 10 inches.  You step out of there, you get out there, and you work.  You shovel up that snow and turn things around.  Oh, you're right.  Okay, now, it came up here.  Yahoo Messenger cannot connect.  Yahoo! 
[01:00:30]  Hee-haw!  Boo-boo-boo-boo-boop-boop-boop-boop-boop-boop-boop-boop-boop-boop-boop-boop-boop.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  Hey, I find the most erotic part of a woman is the boobies.  You're checking out The Opie and Anthony Show.  If you're in the New York area, 877-692-1027 is our phone number.  Braves beat the Astros  They got a two game lead  In the studio, Jim Norton 
[01:01:00]  Adam Farrar  Let's check in with Dallas  Craig, what's up?  What's up, man?  Y'all was bagging on D-Town yesterday  What's up, man?  What happened?  Y'all was bagging on D-Town yesterday  Talking about y'all will never come to Dallas  Why not, man?  Well, we're on in the middle of the night  No, we're on in the middle of the night in Dallas  So it's kind of tough to do anything for Dallas  I know, that's the only thing that sucks, man  Because I work at another radio station here in Dallas 
[01:01:30]  And I work in the D-Town  And I caught you guys one night, man  And I got hooked, man  I'm up until 2 in the morning every night  Trying to catch you guys, man  That is so weird that we're on 10P to 2A somewhere  Yeah, because they would rather bring in  See, what happened is, let me tell you  There's a station down here  Does anyone else care in America, though  What you're about to say?  No, I'm just asking, seriously  No, I'm just trying to tell you  What kind of tool of a station you guys are with down here  Yeah, they know best 
[01:02:00]  So they're going to do what they think is best for the radio station  What can I tell you?  Yeah, but the tickets in Dallas will definitely wow  So we'll be on in the middle of the night  I'm a big Cowboy fan, dude  I'm a big Cowboy fan  And we'll go to Dallas  I think when the Cowboys win two games in a row  Craig, thanks for the support, though  We appreciate that  Hey, man, I love you guys, man  I'm still listening every night  All right, thank you  Hey, till the end  Till y'all get a better shot, man  Holler  All right, peace  Yeah 
[01:02:30]  All right, we have lots to do  We have a letter from Stalker Patty apologizing for her actions on the show the other day  Do you see how lunatic this woman is?  This is what mental patients do to pull you back in  Yes  They make you feel sorry for them  And then, you know, you realize you're a human being  And then you're like, okay, I'm sorry  And then they're close to you again  I was shaking  And, well, we could read this  It's about a five-page letter  Oh, my God  And in the letter, she talks about 
[01:03:00]  There's no punctuation  No, in the letter, she talks about being an ant, which is pretty interesting  Being an ant  You know  No, she thinks she's an insect  Yeah  Well, it was a while back  I believe it was Norton, right?  That said, this woman has the body of an ant  She is  She's very frail and fragile looking  And her body is very ant-like  And we've been goofing on her about that  Now she's acknowledging it in her letter  She's referring to herself as an ant  Yeah, you want to get everyone up to speed 
[01:03:30]  About what happened the other day  Not the whole Patty story  Oh, I know  Because that's a nightmare  Patty's just basically a stalker of this program  And of Opie more so, thank God  No joking, she really is a stalker  People are like, ha ha, a little radio bit  I hear this stuff on the morning zoo all the time  But what makes her a scary stalker  Is she can lift ten times her body weight  Right, very scary  Right  A stalker doesn't have to be the person  That shows up at your door with a gun  It's preferable  But it doesn't have to be  And Patty is a type of stalker 
[01:04:00]  And we learned stalkers stick together  So there's a stalker in Chicago  Yeah  Who decided to mail Stalker Patty  All my personal info  And I was taking care of it behind the scenes  But Patty decided to tell my girlfriend  And she lost her ass at the Beacon Theater  Which made for a nightmare of a night  So then I lost it on Patty the other day  Not only that though  But Patty at the Beacon Theater  Was all pissed off and upset  That she couldn't get backstage  Meanwhile, it wasn't our gig  It was Jane Moore's 
[01:04:30]  She was complaining to certain people  Like looking at people that were backstage  And going  I saw people I didn't know back there  I've been involved at the show for quite a while  Why?  Why am I being treated like this?  Four fists waving in the air  Two feet planted on the ground  You know, people she doesn't know  Being backstage  And wants to know why they're backstage  Tiny abdomen shaking back and forth  Hanging from that little thread-like thing  Between the thorax and the abdomen 
[01:05:00]  And that little hair-like whiskery piece of material  That is just too thin to support life  I never realized how it worked  But on Patty it's just shaking back and forth  Why?  Right, so  She was  I have something real quick  She was standing just outside the entrance  To the dressing room  And she looked at me and said  They're not letting me go up there  So I said  I don't know Patty  I was standing there with six people  That I brought with me  That were members of the union  That I worked with  They're very important people  This one guy resembled Keith the cop 
[01:05:30]  He resembles him  Mind you  I mean, you look at him  You know it's not Keith the cop  She stood there staring at him going  Keith  Keith  Keith  And the guy didn't answer  The guy was like  Who is this  Why isn't Keith  Paying attention  I'm one of the  Family  She was frightening, man  Loony  Hey, what's this white powder in the envelope  Oh, don't even  It's probably dandruff  From her pubic hair  Oh 
[01:06:00]  Worse than anthrax  She addresses the whole  Trying to get backstage  At the Jay Moore show  At the beacon  And other things  We left it with  Basically making  Soccer Patty cry  We're not proud of ourselves  But that's what happened  No, no  Cry is too  Nice a word  For what she was doing  We told her to get lost  She was like bawling  Hysterical  Like when you see in the movie  They tell somebody  That somebody they love  Just died  That's how she's crying  And as per Mary 
[01:06:30]  Our intern  She released fluids  On herself  She was so upset  There's no 100% guarantee  With that  But she smelled  Very, very funny  She smelled like  Someone that was at  The Friars Club  Right  Like the Friars  Diaper  Yeah, exactly  I wrote that  No, because we asked you to  She was so upset  And losing it  That we said  Mary, please bring her  To the bathroom  So she could kind of  Freshen up  And get herself together  I didn't  What did we do? 
[01:07:00]  I didn't do anything  She was upset  And you guys were laughing  So I went in there  On the good of my own heart  Alright, that's fine  Why are you making fun of me?  All it was  Was the fluid  We used to bond  The larvae together  And the chamber  Still a hatch  It has a urine-like sense  It's how we keep the walls up  In our homes  I don't understand  She was shaking 
[01:07:30]  I mean, shaking to the point  Where she couldn't walk  From the bathroom to the studio  Like she was holding on to me  You know, they do that  Just before they attack  Yeah, they shake  They do shake  And they come out of everywhere  With those huge mandibles  They're giant  And what is that  We're not proud statements  We're not very proud of that  You were very happy with that  I've never seen Opie so pleased  I was just trying to redeem myself  Because the email I got  The next day  Oh, yeah  Usually email doesn't get to me  Some of it was  I should have read  Some of that on the air  One of them was from Cindy Williams  She was really big 
[01:08:00]  Yeah  And because of the Patty incident  I shredded my vocal cords  By the way  Yeah  Because of this  Shut up  Literally shredded them  Where I might have to go  To like a throat specialist  That's like Muslim rage  My voice hurts so much  Every time I talk now  Yeah, that is Muslim rage  This is like  Picture the flags burning  They're chanting  All the beards  Filthy animals in the streets  And then they're yelling  Shut up  Yeah 
[01:08:30]  I can see it  There's not a lot of distortion  In that, by the way  That was my voice  Going past what your vocal cords  Are supposed to do  One more time  Let's hear it  Shut up  Okay  Yeah  So Mary  When she walked Patty  To the bathroom  She came running back in  Saying, hey man  Patty relieved herself  She smells like  You know  Number one  Right  Like she did a number one  On herself while weeping  That's not what Mary said exactly 
[01:09:00]  Mary came back with her hand out  And said, smell my fingers  And who didn't  Usually that's hot  Everyone did  Yeah, until you realize  Smell my finger  Oh, okay  It was Patty  No, I had to wash my hands afterwards  Because I was  I kind of hugged her a little bit  You hugged her?  Well, she was  Dude, she was so upset  I want to  I didn't know what to do  All right, well  Mary, hit on her  Shut up  She hit on Patty  So I will  I will hand over the  You did?  I will hand over the letter to Anthony 
[01:09:30]  So he can read it as  Stalker Patty  This is the  Okay  Ladies  Latest installment of  The soap opera  That is Stalker Patty  Yeah  Let me see the  Just listen for the guilt  Here it is  And this is what mental patients do  They give you the guilt  And then you invite them back  Into the  Into the fold  Oh, wait  We need some  We need some music  Before you  Before you read the letter  Double-sided  Yeah, I know  She wrote on both sides  Here we go  Here we go  This letter needs music too  Oh, play  Play that sad walking away song 
[01:10:00]  From the incredible home  Oh, and I and company  This is in response to Monday's episode in the studio  Please cut me a little slack  You're judging me kind of harshly  My life has been turned upside down  In the span of less than a week  And I had to move an entire room into storage  Pack my bags  Leave a place that was an illegal rental 
[01:10:30]  That I didn't know about  Under an immediate eviction  Finding myself suddenly homeless overnight  And scrambling for temporary lodging  Trying to relocate to a new home  What does that have to do with anything  With no money  And continue  There has not been a period yet  And continuing to work my two jobs  Without taking any time off  You're right, no punctuation either 
[01:11:00]  I apologize  Oh, my God  They put me at the bottom of the hive  Where I have to gnaw through solid rock  To see the light of day  Now she goes  On top of that  The two crooks I rented from  For three months with no lease  Were threatening me over the phone at work 
[01:11:30]  Because they wanted more money from me  One was a blue-eyed fog  So  So they're  They're trying to get more money from her  She'll pay it  Distortion  Is part of this letter now  Right  Last night I found a place  I actually signed a lease  And made arrangements  To take on an extra to the rent 
[01:12:00]  To make up  For a security deposit  First page  I just flipped over  Nothing about anything  But her problems  Finding a place to live  Well, that's what they do though, man  And now  Some of the stress  I've been carrying  Is beginning to go away  As problems get solved  All this was happening  In the span of a couple of days  With no mental preparation  Of warning  And not knowing 
[01:12:30]  What was going to happen next  Plus I was alone  With my situation  Fending for myself  With literal  No help from others  In the colony  No help from others  In an unforeseen situation  That just  Heaped itself on me  Some of that  Bottled up stress  Expressed itself  On Sunday night  I know I should  Not have gotten  So upset 
[01:13:00]  When I wasn't allowed  Upstairs  After the show  I'd been  Dealing with a huge  Situation all week  And merely  Wanted some  Company  In a festive  Atmosphere  That would take me  Away from my  Circumstances  For a couple of minutes  Because I was not  A stranger  To some people  Upstairs  I didn't think  It was a problem

[01:34:30]  Told  You  No  Wire  Hangers  Never  I  Told  You  No  Wire  Hangers 
[01:35:00]  Never  I 
[01:35:30]  I guess we need an explanation.  Well, Anthony, the Post has a cute little story today.  I saw that.  Page six.  We were on page six recently, so it must be true.  Right.  Madonna, abortion chronicle.  Madonna would be the mother of... 
[01:36:00]  Yeah, right.  Madonna would be the mother of...  13 children.  If she hadn't had 11 abortions over the years.  I told you, no wire hangers ever!  You're sluts.  Must look like a bull in there.  Ravaged.  Madonna would be the mother of 13 children if she hadn't had 11 abortions over the years, 
[01:36:30]  according to Goddess, an unauthorized biography by Barbara Victor, out next month from HarperCollins.  11 abortions?  One abortion came right before Madonna met her hubby, Guy Ritchie.  She had a pregnancy in between Lourdes and Rocco, Victor told Peter.  Hey!  I got a hanger in my hand!  It was with a British man, she added, refusing to name him until the book comes out.  After the 11th abortion, Madonna met Ritchie and pursued him relentlessly, calling him every 20 minutes one night during a dinner party held by Sting's wife. 
[01:37:00]  Although Ritchie was mesmerized by Madonna in the beginning, he had no intentions of being a one-woman man, Victor said.  But when Madonna became pregnant, Ritchie decided to settle down on his father, John Ritchie's advice.  Guy initially stormed out of the house when she told him she was pregnant and went to tell his father, whom he's quite close with, Victor said.  His father told him, if this is your baby, you have to do the right thing and support the baby. 
[01:37:30]  And that's pretty much it.  After 11 abortions, when you do get pregnant, they have to do this.  Oh, God!  What a disgrace!  11!  Make the guys wear bags or swallow or use a little action.  Something, right?  You know, this is a woman who's using abortion as birth control.  If that's true, what a slob.  Well, this woman, I guess, if she's going to print something like this, she had better have some proof. 
[01:38:00]  Some serious proof.  Because if she doesn't, she's in trouble.  And if she does, then I guess Madonna's not going to be saying anything.  The dumping?  The dumping out of some of the discussion, yeah.  Oh, a little too graphic.  Do you think I phrased that one wrong?  Graphic?  I think I did, actually.  You phrased it wrong.  Maybe after you have 11 abortions, a stapler is required to keep the new pregnancy from just tumbling out when you do a jumping jacket. 
[01:38:30]  That's beautiful.  That's good.  That works.  God damn, you're getting good.  A staple is required.  I need to know if that made the radio now.  How could it not?  You're learning fast, my friend.  I wouldn't say staple, though.  I'd say something more akin to when you lace up the turkey on Thanksgiving after stuffing it from something a little more protective.  Maybe crazy glue or something.  Crazy glue might work, something like that.  Just stitching. 
[01:39:00]  I think we made it with that.  I think that made it.  One of those bag clips for potato chips.  Well, with an extra strong spring.  That's right.  Like the hair things that the chicks wear, you know?  Where they just put it up and it...  I think they call it a banana clip.  The banana clip down there.  And from the old pictures of her, I think it could really weave into that hair.  Although it's bad to have 11 abortions, the good part is you can now easily smuggle a fire plug.  With the way those pictures look to her, all hairy and stuff, I swear to God, I just picture the scene in the clinic looking like Fidel Castro vomiting up his filet mignon. 
[01:39:30]  Right?  That would be what it looked like.  Awful.  Like members of the Hamas.  That's it.  She had a...  It's Hamas beard.  She had a Taliban beard in her face.  A Taliban gentleman that just bit his tongue very hard.  Look at us updating the joke.  Can we play the Stephen Lynch song?  Where is that? 
[01:40:00]  Stephen Lynch has a cute song for Madonna today.  Ah, we can actually get through this?  I don't know.  Did we edit it enough?  All right, let's give it a try.  Let's see what happens, okay?  Our buddy Stephen Lynch is going to be joining us in Philly a week from today.  I kiss you on the cheek.  Good night, my love, I say.  You turn to me and smile.  A baby is on the way. 
[01:40:30]  And then you drift asleep to dream of life anew.  And I lie wondering just what I should do.  I could kick you in the stomach and catch you unawares.  I could swear to God you accidentally fell that flight of stairs.  When I tell you that I love you, I will look you in the eye. 
[01:41:00]  As I slowly slide the...  I guess I'm not the fathering type of guy.  That's all I got.  I don't know what I'm saying.  Oh, wow.  Oh, my God, we got a new game.  If that made it through, bro.  Right.  You just made our show ten times better.  I don't understand that either.  I can say hang or whatever I want.  Well, you can.  Absolutely.  There you go. 
[01:41:30]  Like at the cleaners.  I like the way your suit and stuff always comes back on a nice brand new.  What?  They dumped out?  Yeah, it didn't make it.  That's okay.  Because I want to change the subject here.  Okay.  I finally found a new place that does my cleaning.  Oh, yeah?  They have the best hangers in the world that I hang my clothes on.  Really?  When they send it back.  The best hangers that you could ever imagine.  You know what I did one time?  Yeah.  I dropped a piece of raw meat, and I couldn't get it. 
[01:42:00]  Yeah.  It was on the floor, so I undid a hanger, and I just poked at it.  They're jumping out of that, too?  Why?  How do you dump out of a conversation about the cleaners?  Oh, stop it.  Now he's being stupid.  We're talking about the Chinese cleaners.  You know, the other day, I was going to go on stage, and thank God, the stage manager  looked over to me and said, hey, you got something right out of your nose.  It's right out of your nose.  You got to flick that off there. 
[01:42:30]  Wow.  Look.  Look.  Oh, everything's going now?  I can talk about the aircraft that are in the hangers that are getting bombed over there  in Afghanistan.  What about when you have a really bad itch, and you scratch your thigh with something like  you could use a hanger?  Yes, I'd use that.  Or a hangnail.  Jesus.  Whatever.  It's true.  Jesus.  You know, and they will never defeat us.  We will pull those planes out of the hangers, and they will never defeat us. 
[01:43:00]  You are so right.  They will never defeat us.  And this mission will not be aborted.  Right.  There you go.  Absolutely not.  Did Bush say that?  Yes, and the children.  It will not be aborted.  This is going to be a bloody mess of a war, but it will not be aborted once we pull those  planes out of their hangers, they will not defeat us.  Bush said so.  And this is all Bush said.  That came out of Bush.  I think it should come out of Bush.  That came out of Bush.  That came from Bush.  I'm pretty sure it did. 
[01:43:30]  Wow.  It's getting tougher and tougher around here.  All right.  We should take a quick break.  I know we just broke, but Tenacious D is outside.  Cool.  So we have to take a really fast break, and we'll talk to those guys next.  Okay, what?  No, we'll play when they're in the studio.  Are they going to play for us today?  They brought guitars.  They brought guitars.  That's always a good thing.  Stick around.  You guys are going to laugh your yam bags off.  Tenacious D is next.  Oh, hold on.  Hold on.  What do we got?  I forgot.  I want to go to Jay Moore.  Jay, did you hang up? 
[01:44:00]  Jay Moore.  Jay.  Jay.  I'm going to interrupt Tenacious D, man.  Those guys are funny.  We love the Tenacious D.  I love the show.  I think Madonna, I think the word you're looking for is when she goes to the clinic, they  have to remove the scrunchie from her private part.  Scrunchie.  Get me a scrunchie.  Get me, get my scrunchie back when I get back from the stirrups.  Then I leave my scrunchie.  It's got to look scrunchie.  Norton, you are, Norton's on fire.  Yeah, but barely any of it's getting through. 
[01:44:30]  No, no, we will not.  The war will not be aborted.  I'm sorry.  Absolutely not.  You're right, dude.  You're right.  What's up, Adam?  How are you, Jay?  Great job here tonight.  It was so good to see you Sunday, and it was so good to just work with all your friends,  man.  It was ridiculous.  It was ridiculous how fun and smooth that went.  Yeah, you did a great job.  A lot of fun.  Jay, getting rave reviews.  $40,000 to rescue one, baby.  We raised $40,000?  Just a check for $40,000 right to them.  Spend it on beer, blankets, ladders. 
[01:45:00]  Just spend it on something, because they deserve it.  Well, they need a new truck, too, right?  Yeah, so that'll help.  And we handed them about $1,200 in cash at Ruby Foods at the after party.  Oh, that's gone.  Is that what they were drinking with that night?  Yeah, they drove us home.  Nothing like being driven home by drunk firemen.  They're letting my wife bring the siren.  People are pulling over, diving out of the way.  Hey, that's cool, man.  They were really cool.  I'm going to Tempe tonight.  I just wanted to check in with you guys before I hit the road, and thank you again, because  I didn't get a chance to call you yesterday.  You did a good thing, my friend. 
[01:45:30]  You did a good thing.  You guys did a good thing.  You helped out.  A lot of fun.  Hey, anybody got any ideas?  I have to interview the Arizona Cardinals this week.  Oh, really?  That's a tough sell.  How fun.  Hey, look, they got one win in a row.  I know.  Let's ride that wave, everyone.  Well, I'm just checking in to thank you guys before I hit the road, and I just wanted to  get scrunchie out, but I certainly don't want anyone to miss any of Tenacious D's, so 
[01:46:00]  I'm going to decapitate and jump off the phone here, and thank you again.  Thank you, Jay.  God bless you guys.  I'll talk to you.  Cheers.  40,000 raised.  That's the latest benefit.  Nice.  We're going to be doing a lot of these things in the coming months.  Hell yeah.  And it reminds me of that song we used to sing when we were kids.  You remember you'd be on a long car ride, and you'd sing, 99 fetuses on the floor.  And it would just keep going down and down.  Yeah.  So if your pants came off, and you'd hear a wet ker-plunk.  There's no way that made it. 
[01:46:30]  Ker-plunk?  There is no way that made it.  Nah.  All right.  Let's calm the F down.  We've got Tenacious D up next.  How old are you?  18.  All right.  Well, you showed up.  Wow.  Fabulous.  Wow.  Opie ravioli.  Opie and Anthony.  Anthony.  Hey, you're checking out the Opie and Anthony show.  Look who's in the studio, Anthony.  Yes.  Tenacious D.  It's true.  It's true.  It's the D. 
[01:47:00]  And it is A.  They just did TRL, and look.  Look, we're next.  How'd that go for you?  I feel all dirty.  Yeah?  TRL.  You know, last night we played in Cleveland, and at the end we announced we were going to  be on TRL.  And everyone booed.  There was hisses and hisses.  They were like, boo.  I wonder why.  Apparently it's not really heavy metal to do.  I don't think it's the cool move.  It's not like the coolest thing to do.  It's not the cool move.  Well, you're not a boy band.  That's the problem.  I know.  We went on right after O-Town.  Yeah?  And then one of the dudes from NSYNC.  And then the D.  What's wrong with the picture? 
[01:47:30]  I looked outside at Times Square looking for the girls screaming.  Yeah.  Yeah, yeah.  Because they got the girls out there screaming with signs and everything.  Yeah, where the hell were they?  Yeah, where were they?  I was showing up.  Dude, we rolled up on TRL.  We rolled up and got out of the car.  You know what?  And there was like a momentary excitement until they realized, oh, it's no one.  It's no one.  Oh, nobody's in there.  Nobody's in there.  I thought you guys said you had a lot of groupies.  Dude, we do.  And it was a very poor showing.  And all the D fans out there, I'd like to scold you.  Where were you?  You didn't have our backs, peeps.  You didn't have our backs. 
[01:48:00]  Were you able to hang with Carson?  We partied with Carson.  Yeah?  Yeah, we put the hammer down.  I hear he gets a lot of the girls.  Is that true?  What?  Yeah, that's what I see.  You know what does it?  It's a space between his teeth.  It drives him nutso.  I guess.  I got one, too.  You can click between that, I guess.  Did he get to read cue cards with Carson?  No, man.  I don't look at cue cards.  No, he just went off the cuff.  You know, he was riffing.  We're flying off the handle.  Carson was riffing today.  Nice.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Stop it.  He's like a robot.  He was like a robot statue. 
[01:48:30]  I was doing like cartwheels and stuff, flipping around them, and he just kept on talking, just  like nothing was happening.  Exactly.  Full Robotron 5000.  That dude's rad.  I hear if somebody, like you shoot him in the shoulder, you see a bunch of metal, and  then it slowly comes back together, and it looks really cool, and he can run, and his  arms turn into these big hammer things.  They can pry elevators apart.  Yeah.  He's the Carson 1000.  The Carson 1000.  Love that.  Well, I'm glad you had fun there.  Hey, he's starting to look around a little bit. 
[01:49:00]  Yeah.  You've got a very evil look, my friend.  Do I?  You just focus.  I have a darting...  What are you focusing on over there?  Evil stare.  I call him Wolfen.  The Wolfen.  Wolfen.  I don't know.  I'm just looking around.  I'm scoping it out.  I'm checking out the territory.  So how did you guys become the greatest band of all time?  I see.  You're laughing.  They call themselves the greatest band of all time.  Aren't you supposed to say the self-proclaimed before that?  They're the greatest.  Even Michael Jackson got the self-proclaimed king of pop, because he made that up for himself.  They beat out Styx, and Jethro Tull and stuff. 
[01:49:30]  Dude, honestly, I've never said that we are.  It's just the historians, and its popular opinion, were the best.  Whatever.  It's true.  You're not going to disagree.  I'm not going to...  Yeah.  I'm not going to deny it.  How did we become it?  Yeah.  How did you become the greatest band?  It's not something you can cultivate, buddy.  I know.  If I had the secret, I'd bottle it.  I'd give it to you.  And I'd say, give it out for free so everyone can be the best.  We live in a better world of best people.  Absolutely.  Unfortunately, I can't.  And it's just us, and we're alone up here at the tippity-top and the chopper-most.  It's cold. 
[01:50:00]  It's lonely up here.  No one to talk to with the brains and the power and the might of the D.  Hey, you're scaring everyone.  I know.  All of a sudden, there's crickets.  Here's the way they can sense now.  I'm in the group, and I'm frightened.  I'm sorry, Rage.  No, dude, you're up here, too.  Slightly lower on another mountain peak, though.  Give us the abbreviated version of the Tenacious D story.  Rage, you take this one.  Well, I was cruising Santa Monica Boulevard.  This was in the early days.  Just driving around late at night.  I needed money.  And I don't know.  I saw a young man.  It looked like he needed some mentors. 
[01:50:30]  Yeah.  He pulled over, and I said, hey, man, what's up?  You want to spend some time?  And he was like, no.  I don't want any of that.  I just want to teach you the ways of rock.  And he took me under his wing.  Yeah.  And he's been riding my coat sales ever since.  Did I say coat sales?  Coat sales.  I meant coat tails.  We were calling a new phrase.  We're going to let it come out.  No one really knows.  That's a classic Obi-Wan, Luke story right there.  It is.  It's the hero's journey. 
[01:51:00]  And now you've got an album.  Yeah.  You just called it Tenacious D, though.  Couldn't you come up with a witty title for it?  We were thinking Grammy time.  Grammy time.  But then we bailed on that.  Yeah.  What else were we thinking?  Stroyer.  Yeah, because then it would be D-Stroyer.  Ah, we were thinking it could have been.  Thank God you clarified.  They weren't going to clue into that for quite a while.  I was going to take a while.  I wanted it to be called Mollish.  Demolish.  Very good.  We had some other one.  Time for my breakfast.  Time for my breakfast.  Named it, of course, after the Chuck Berry legendary secret video that no one's seen. 
[01:51:30]  All right.  How about just call it O?  O-D.  Tenacious D.  Wait, that's not that.  D-O.  D-O.  Oh, D.  Yeah.  I don't know what you're saying.  Well, they have a song about D-O on the album.  I thought it was D-O.  We were thinking about an alternate name for our band would be Standing O.  Standing O.  I want to party with these guys.  All right.  Dude, you should.  You're out of your happy minds, man. 
[01:52:00]  Yeah, drinking that Avion.  Oh, look out.  Dude.  Yeah, can I have a cup of that, dude?  Of course.  My pipes are roasted.  Let's go to Jason.  Jason, what's up?  What's up, guys?  Talking about Tenacious D.  Sweet.  Yeah.  Yeah, I wanted to know if you guys had any plans to do any more HBO shows or if you're  going to do a movie or anything.  An oft-asked question, Jason.  No more HBO shows.  I don't know.  Yeah, what happened with HBO?  Well, they were like...  We did the episodes and they were shredding and people were being blown away and then 
[01:52:30]  they were like, yeah, let's do a real show.  Let's do a full-time show and it'll be like the De Sopranos.  The DePranos.  And we're like, yeah, let's do it.  Let's party now.  And they said, only one little switcheroo.  You guys just go write the songs and we'll get a staff together to tell you what to do  like puppets on a string, like the monkeys.  And we said, no.  And then they said, well, then bail.  And we said, we will.  We walked.  They came back with some more dough, though. 
[01:53:00]  But now I think if we went back...  They came back with some more dough.  They did, actually.  They'd probably party with us now, but...  We're working on the Tenacious D motion picture.  Yeah.  Yeah.  You know, why would you go back?  In 2004, that's going to come out.  Mike, you're next.  Oh, hey.  What's up, bro?  Listen, man.  I have a little warning.  Yeah.  Just be prepared.  Okay.  Get your asses blown out.  Wait, our asses?  You're going to blow our asses out?  I'm telling you, Anthony.  Oh, them.  Oh. 
[01:53:30]  These guys are going to blow us away or what?  Yeah.  Just your asses.  Rock your freaking socks.  Cage.  Jables.  Yeah.  You guys rule.  Thanks, man.  It's true.  I see a guitar.  I don't want to...  I think some people are letting out Taliban messages in these conversations.  No one's doing that.  Because I know that Colin Powell is upset that maybe some videos that have been out have  been giving away these Taliban messages to terrorists.  Well, Jack does have a Timex watch.  You're not doing anything like that?  Because that last caller that seemed to really enjoy you guys, I don't know what he was even 
[01:54:00]  talking about.  Buddy, welcome to the D. The land of the D. People talking in gibberish.  You might be a little paranoid, though.  Okay.  Yeah.  Well, everyone's paranoid these days.  You know what I mean?  What are you talking about, my Timex?  What does that have to do with the Taliban?  Well, uh...  Which one does he wear, though?  The Iron Man.  The Iron Man.  Bin Laden wears the Timex Iron Man watch.  Oh, man.  Oh, that's right.  Sales are going through the roof.  Who doesn't want that now?  I don't know.  The terrorist watch.  I'll get that in the white Bronco and we'll party.  I'm just bummed because I lost my G-Shock somewhere on the tour. 
[01:54:30]  And that was my lucky magical G-Shock watch.  Someone horsed it from me.  If there's a listener out there, please, please send it in.  Hey, Chris, what do you got?  Based on what I want to know, when are we going to see the D?  It's some bigger places.  They are the greatest rock and roll band of all time.  Where do you live?  Jersey.  Jersey?  Where do the Jersey Giants play?  Giant Stadium.  That's where we're playing, dude.  We'll see you there.  That'll be you and us.  And that's it.  But it'll be big. 
[01:55:00]  When are you going to play Giant Stadium?  We don't have it.  It's not on the schedule at this point.  But it'll happen, right?  I don't know.  Is anyone in there right now?  Let's go.  Nick, what's going on?  Hey, what's up, guys?  Hey.  Hey, what's going on?  This is the third show I'm going to see you guys.  I saw you guys at the Bowery.  Then we drove up to a place in Boston, Avalon.  Now I'm going to see you at the electric factory.  I've got to tell you something.  The evolution of D, the first show that we saw you at, it was like a big sword fight. 
[01:55:30]  Then there were hundreds and thousands of backstage Bettys, the last show in Boston.  I am psyched for the Philly show.  So I can't wait to see all the Hoochie Mama and Pooned over there.  That's funny because it only holds a thousand people.  There's a hundred thousand Bettys trying to get into the backstage area.  Sounds good to me.  We've done studies and our audience is 91% sausage.  Yeah.  And there's 8% donuts.  And then there's 1% strange mutants.  We don't know what they are.  They're playing the electric factory tomorrow night.  Thank you for the plug, dude. 
[01:56:00]  Yo, you guys rule, man.  All right, Nick.  Take care.  I want to hear a song.  I see the guitar.  You want us to bust off a chunk?  Yeah.  I would love to bust off a chunk.  I'll do it.  Hook us up.  Hook us up.  Rage, you play the guitar.  I'll play the guitar.  I'll be in charge of the vocal stylings.  All right.  What are you guys going to play today?  This is our second single off the album.  It's actually the hidden track.  Which is the first single?  Effer Gently?  No.  Oh, you're right.  This is the third single.  Effer Gently was the first one.  Did you see that cartoon we did?  No, I missed it.  TenaciousD.com, dude.  Check it out.  Okay.  All right.  This is called Malibu Nights. 
[01:56:30]  Is that in tune?  Dude, no, that's not in tune.  Way to go.  We're going to try another good one.  There's some Sourney.  All right.  You would think the greatest band of all time would be, you know, prepared with tuned guitars  and stuff.  They got one right there.  Is he your roadie or your guitar tech?  Dude, the dude is magical.  He's magical?  I think some...  I think...  Okay.  Uh-oh.  Malibu...  All right.  Is that...  How's that sound? 
[01:57:00]  Malibu Nights, Tangerine Dreams, Malibu Days, Malibu Dreams, Malibu Dreams.  Malibu, you're taking a poo.  A stanky poo, looking at you.  Because it's time for my breakfast.  It's time for some cheese.  It's time for the stink.  Time for the breeze.  It's time for my...  Thank you. 
[01:57:30]  That was just...  Yeah.  Yeah.  Way to put in the effort there.  All right.  It sounded weird, dude.  I think you were playing in a different key.  Yeah, I was playing in the wrong key.  You were playing...  That's what?  Dude, it's not out of tune.  Joe BB, your job is safe.  This dude...  I thought I was, like, way up at the wrong of all time.  I've never really played the secret track.  Really high notes.  All right.  Matt, what's going on?  That is the secret track.  You're right.  Matt, what's up?  Hey, what's up, D?  What up, dude?  Yo.  How'd you guys get hooked up with Dave Grohl on the album?  We was playing pinball in an arcade, and then he was like, let me get in on that game. 
[01:58:00]  And I said, you can, but if we win, then you play on the album.  He said, no prob.  And we shredded his ass off.  That's not true.  We actually met him at the Viper Room.  Wait, did he get hung up on?  He just hung up.  He hung up on himself.  He didn't want that to not be true.  So after he heard it, he was like, rock, and now he's telling everybody that's the story.  And now that's the story.  I think he just got so excited, his boner turned off the phone. 
[01:58:30]  It just hit the phone.  That could happen.  Sure.  Dan, what's up?  Yo, what's up?  We got D in the house, dude.  What's up, Dan?  It's true, dude.  Hell yeah, dude.  We're not the robot impersonators.  We are the D.  Can you bust out some of the karate song over there, David?  You got it.  Let me get it.  Let me get it.  Go, go.  Look at Tom.  They're trading off guitars and stuff.  Yeah, sure.  Can you bleep it if it goes bad?  Bleep it.  Yeah, but then we lose like eight seconds of the show.  But then you can store up some more seconds at the commercial booth. 
[01:59:00]  All right, dude.  It's like evil radio.  I will take out all of the cuss words, but it's going to be really lame, and they're going to say sell out.  With the right of your kick, your ass.  Yeah, to T and I'm in the square arms.  Oh, yeah, Mother Hubbard.  I'm going to kick your fucking dairy.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  You broke the rules, and now I pull out all your pubic hair.  Yeah, you Mother Hubbard. 
[01:59:30]  You Mother Father.  Kyle betrayed me, and then he lied, tried to hide, and I died deep inside.  And you know the reason why.  I'm going to kick your ass from here to right over there.  Oh, yeah, Mother Hubbard.  I'm going to kick your...  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Get out the room.  Now I pull out all your pubic hair.  You Mother Father. 
[02:00:00]  That's right.  You Mother Father.  Oh, yeah.  All right.  Yeah.  Put that on the Christmas album.  I like that.  Tenacious Dig.  Appreciate it.  Hey, Jay, what's up?  How's it going?  All right, we're hanging with Tenacious Dig.  What's up?  What up?  What up with you?  How'd you guys wind up with Paige from Fish?  Paige?  Knock hockey.  Let me tell you something.  Let me tell you something about Paige. 
[02:00:30]  He invited us to see a show.  Yeah.  Met up with him down there.  Cage went over.  And then about every day he called me.  Yeah.  I knew it.  Like, dude, don't you have a gig?  Another gig to do?  Yeah, didn't you guys, you, Paige, you went into the bus, didn't you, on the fish bus?  I really did.  I mean.  What was going down in there, man?  I thought it was like the reverse Lee effect.  It was Fran Drescher and a nitrous tank.  No way.  I swear to God.  I swear to God.  To your Fran Drescher.  And a nitrous.  And they were all going nuts.  Sounds like a party.  Is it just me or Fran? 
[02:01:00]  Something about her.  I don't know.  There's something about that.  Good?  You like it?  Yeah.  No, there's something bad, but there's also something like, yeah.  I like Fran and the Bobby Fleckman phase of her career.  Oh, those are the final tabs.  I'm sure she'd appreciate that.  She was kind of hot in there.  And then the nanny stuff was just like, I don't know.  No, I'm not saying I'm down with the show.  No, I'm not.  I'm just talking about her in that time of her life.  Yeah.  I like the Bobby Fleckman.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I don't blame you.  That was hot.  Those were good days. 
[02:01:30]  I think she's always working on her fanny, though.  Yeah, she does some fanny exercises, I heard.  Liz has a problem with you guys.  Liz?  I absolutely do not have a problem with Tenacious D.  They're the best.  Thank you, sweetie.  I love Tenacious D.  You guys rock so hard.  Apparently, you got on because you said you had a problem.  No, no.  I didn't say I had a problem.  I'll tell you what I'm saying.  They wanted someone who had a problem.  No, no.  Not a problem.  Thank you, honey.  No, I love you guys.  All right, Jack, I wanted to see if you remembered.  About a year and a half ago at the Bowery Ballroom, you were playing, and someone threw a Knicks hat on the stage.  Yeah. 
[02:02:00]  And you threw it back into the audience.  Why did I do that?  Because you were just done.  Because I'm down with the Lakers.  Yeah, they were making fun of the Lakers.  You're going back and forth.  And you were just, ah, screw this.  And you go to throw it into the audience.  Yeah.  And you threw it right down instead of out, and you hit me right in the face with the hat.  Oh, sweetie.  No, it's okay.  It was cool.  You felt really bad.  And you felt right down.  I could tell you felt really bad.  Did I give you a courtesy make-out session?  No, unfortunately, my boyfriend was with me.  All right.  Yeah, he was right there.  What else was there?  Hey, if the boyfriend wasn't there, would you have given him a little hop there?  Oh, I love the D, but I love my boyfriend more. 
[02:02:30]  Sorry, guys.  Oh, hey.  I love my Tommy.  No problem.  But I had a big mark from the Knicks hat right across my face for like two or three days straight.  And I love telling everyone about it because you guys are the best.  Well, thanks for not pressing charges.  Oh, I never.  I love you guys.  All right.  Thanks, Liz.  Bye.  Let's go to Eric.  Eric, what's up?  Hey, how you guys doing?  Good.  Awesome.  I was at the Cleveland show last night at Diagora.  Yeah, man.  You guys just absolutely rocked the house, man.  Cleveland steamer, baby.  That's what we did.  Yep.  We squeezed one off.  All right.  They're playing Philly tomorrow. 
[02:03:00]  Electric factory.  It's true.  Thanks again for the part.  All right.  Thank you.  Let's go to Mike.  Mike, what's up?  Hey, I just wanted to ask Tenacious D to play the tribute song.  Oh, the tribute song?  Let's just bust out a long song.  No, dude.  No, come on.  My pipes is roasted.  I've got to save some for the Philly factory.  Well, I'm going to come see as far as it is.  Let's just give it just the acapella part.  All right.  All right.  All right.  All right.  All right.  All right.  All right.  Rich, what are you doing?  I didn't know.  I can't just jump in without you. 
[02:03:30]  All right.  All right.  All right.  All right.  All right.  Don't leave me hanging alone.  Sorry, sir.  Cage fumbled the ball.  Ah, he left you hanging out there, man.  Yeah.  You put in the effort.  Can I just say, though, we were here a couple weeks ago.  You're starting to sound like Focus there.  Hocus Pocus by Focus.  Is that a band?  I was enjoying that a lot.  Are they like Bobby McFerrin?  Hocus Pocus?  Yeah, a little bit.  You remember Focus by Hocus Pocus?  No.  Yeah, was that old song?  Hocus Pocus by Focus?  No.  What song did they do?  Maybe by...  Yodeling song.  Yodeling song. 
[02:04:00]  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, and then it turned really hardcore.  I love that song.  You know, we're looking for D franchises.  Is that it?  Right?  Kind of like the Blue Man Group, you know, where you're playing around the company?  It doesn't have to be the Blue Man Group, just a Blue Man Group around.  Sure.  Gain some weight.  That would rock.  I'm more of a Stomp fan myself.  Oh, Stomp.  I'm a Stomp.  You know, I heard that Stomp was really awesome, and then I saw some of it on HBO, and I was 
[02:04:30]  like, oh my God, Snooze Fest.  When does the party start, people?  Sit through it.  It's a live experience.  I think you've got to be there live, yeah.  You can really go on TV.  You can play with your own brooms at home.  That's what I'm saying.  Hey, Jessica.  Hey.  What's up?  How you guys doing?  Rad.  Hanging with Tenacious Day.  Hi, Jack.  How you doing, sweetie?  How you doing?  Real good.  Yeah.  Listen, I need your permission.  Yeah?  Well, let's hear what it is first.  I don't give it without knowing.  Do I get out of here?  My, uh...  You're quiet.  I'm talking to my lady.  All right. 
[02:05:00]  I'm talking to his number one backstage, Betty.  Mm-hmm.  Oh.  Listen, my fiancÃ© and I, although I'll give him up for you for a night.  Yeah.  For a night.  Listen.  I'll warm you up for him.  We want to use Effort Gently for our wedding song.  Really?  No joke.  And could you imagine if we stood up there on the dance floor and we played Effort Gently?  Yeah.  Yeah.  I need your permission to...  Yeah.  I think the rants are going to be a little bummed out about it, but I'm stoked.  I think if I get up there and said, you know, the band gave us permission, we could play it,  and then, you know, we'll just tell the grandparents to cover their ears or something. 
[02:05:30]  May we give you our blessing.  Yes.  Oh, thank you, guys.  Love you all.  Have a good honeymoon.  All right.  Bye.  Can we play that song?  Yeah.  We got the...  You got the clean version?  Yeah, we got...  Well, they cleaned it up a little bit.  A clean version.  The first clean version is the good one.  Yeah, it is?  Okay.  Yeah.  This is Tenacious D, Effort Gently.  Awesome.  This is a song.  Wow, that's kind of sad.  Nice.  It's touching.  It's very touching.  Tenacious D, Effort Gently.  Yes. 
[02:06:00]  It's a clean version.  You buy the CD, you get to hear all that.  It's very tender.  All the real words.  Yeah.  All the potty mouth stuff.  Yeah.  I was just looking.  Jack Black in one of my favorite movies of all time, Mars Attack.  Oh, yeah.  I swear to God, I love that movie.  I carried that thing on my shoulders.  You did?  Yeah.  You were the army guy, the soldier guy.  I was.  Went off to fight and got just big.  I had a good jiggly death at the end.  Yeah.  Yeah.  That was good.  And you know what the direction...  What's his name, that director?  Yeah.  Tom Holtz.  Tom Freund.  Tim Burton. 
[02:06:30]  Tim Burton.  He told me.  He said, can you make it like you're kind of having an orgasm right as you're dying?  I was like, all right.  That guy's awesome.  He's like a mad scientist.  He's pretty awesome.  Yeah.  What happened on Planet of the Apes then?  Well, I didn't see it.  Was it good?  Yikers.  You weren't in it.  Yeah.  That's why.  That's why.  Helena Bonham Carter played Michael Jackson.  That's awesome of her.  Really incredible makeup that they did.  I don't know how they recreated that, but somehow they found a way.  And then Waterworld? 
[02:07:00]  Yeah.  I see.  You got quite the nice little...  I'm the pilot on the plane.  Package.  Yeah.  Thank you.  You like my package?  Yeah.  Absolutely.  Enemy of the State?  Yeah.  I was in that.  I still know what you did last summer.  Oh, man.  Dude, can you...  Give me...  Start saying some good ones.  Before you know it.  Hey, I'm sorry.  Never-ending story.  Saving Silverman?  You're no help, Cage.  Jackal?  That was a telecooter.  Ryan's got a good one on the phone.  Ryan?  Yeah.  What's up? 
[02:07:30]  Not much.  I want to know about that crappy movie where he's like a hockey player or a rollerblade hockey player  or something like that.  Airborne.  What was the deal with that movie?  I think you must be confused, man.  I was in a masterpiece called Airborne.  Airborne.  Well, why did you watch it then?  I'm like traumatized for life after watching it.  Yeah, why did you watch it?  I didn't like it.  Do you have a one-channel cable?  I mean, no.  You got to watch a Jack Black movie.  I mean, if you didn't, you got to keep watching it.  It's like heroin.  You know what I'm saying?  You got to keep doing it, but it was still a piece of crap.  That's the bottom line.  Yeah.  So, you know, I can't take full responsibility. 
[02:08:00]  I hope not.  I will take partial responsibility.  All right.  How bad could a guy be that's been in the X-Files?  God damn it.  You were in the X-Files.  That's true.  I did.  Bart LeCourie.  I was the friend of the guy who had the power of lightning in his fingers.  Right.  Yeah.  And then he zapped me.  And life goes on.  You played a skinhead.  Oh, man.  A skinhead in Life Goes On.  Dude, I was also in some rad things.  I understand.  I just like getting into the obscure things that maybe people don't know. 
[02:08:30]  Touched by an angel.  That's true.  I was in Touched by an Angel.  Touched by an Angel.  Northern Exposure.  Northern Exposure.  Thank you, Kyle, again.  Thank you.  Hey, you're going to punch up my friends.  Stop, man.  Punch up mine.  Oh, yeah?  All right.  Let me punch yours up here.  There you go, Mr. Computer Man.  I could do that in a second.  Let's see what you got.  All right.  I got Jacob's Ladder.  That's right.  You were in there.  Lewis Black was in that, too.  He was a...  What did you play in Jacob's Ladder?  The memorable...  Yes, I played the Iceman.  Were you the little kid that walked up the stairs at the end? 
[02:09:00]  That's right.  That was me.  You were a gay dude from next door that put Tim Robbins into a bucket of ice.  That's true.  I was.  He was also in Dead Man Walking.  Yeah.  That's true.  You were in Saving Silverman, of course.  Of course.  And, well, you...  Biodome, of course.  I was in Legendary Seinfeld.  Seinfeld.  I'm looking at the episode of Seinfeld, 1990.  You were the smoker.  Yes.  You got some good credit.  I'm doing my own tour of Seinfeld.  Are you?  Yeah.  Your own Seinfeld-type tour.  That's...  Yeah.  I'm going to make a little extra bread.  Whatever works for you.  Hey, who got their arm shot off? 
[02:09:30]  That'd be me.  Jack, right?  Yeah.  In the Jackal.  In the Jackal.  Yeah.  Nice.  Yeah, thanks, man.  It was sprawl.  Yeah.  Evolution, you were in that?  It was pretty cool.  You know, we were doing that.  We were on a...  No, I wasn't in Evolution.  No.  Come on.  Oh, I was.  Yes, I was.  Oh, him.  I was guarding...  Kyle.  I was guarding the big rock thing.  Oh, that was you.  Yeah.  And David Duchovny and I smoked out.  Did you?  You smoked some pot?  You and Duchovny?  I saw that one.  Cigarettes.  I saw Evolution. 
[02:10:00]  You smoked the cigarettes with him.  So he does the X-Files.  You do...  Ooh, some kind of a little conspiracy thing there.  Ooh.  Ooh.  He is exciting off-camera as he is on.  Thanks, dude.  All right.  We got to let these guys go.  They're busy, man.  Guys, thanks for having us.  They're playing Philly tomorrow night.  The Electric Factory.  Yeah.  You want to come down?  I'll hook you up with some backstage passes.  We'll come by when you're playing New York.  When you're playing New York again.  Soon.  Soon.  The Mega Dome.  Dude, do you have tickets to give away to peeps? 
[02:10:30]  We can give away some tickets to the Electric Factory show tomorrow night.  Sure.  How many can we give away?  Two.  Two pairs of tickets.  You guys are awfully generous.  All right.  You know, I want to play one of my favorite songs off the new album.  Yeah.  I want to play Wonder Boy.  Yeah.  Oh.  You don't like Wonder Boy?  I love Wonder Boy.  Huge.  No, I said, yeah.  All right.  We're going to play Wonder Boy.  Cool.  And we want to thank Jack and Kyle for coming in.  It's Tenacious D.  Yes.  Nice.  Go out and get the album.  Here's Wonder Boy.  Great. 
[02:11:00]  We're about Wednesday.  Oh, man.  One bad door.  Wow.  Wow.  Wow.  Wow.  Wow.  Wow.  Wow.  Wow.  Wow.  The Opie and Anthony show.  I love that.  Anthony Sam Adams.  Look.  Look at.  Look at this.  Look at this.  Oh.  Oh.  That is an ice cold Sam Adams lager. 
[02:11:30]  Mmm.  Mmm.  Columbus Day celebrates the discovery of America.  Oh, yeah.  Sam Adams is the number one selling American beer.  Of course.  It's a great time to kick back.  Either watch, I don't know, the playoffs.  Uh, some of the football games.  Or a war.  The war is a great show to watch and drink.  Ah, a great American beer. 
[02:12:00]  Sam Adams.  Made by genius, uh, Jim Cook and a great friend of ours.  Go out.  Doesn't matter what you're doing.  You're going to one of the games.  You're hanging out at home with your pals, uh, uh, watching the game.  Or just hanging out by yourself trying to drown your sorrows like Patty.  Sam Adams does it.  Sam Adams.  The station for sports guys, Don and Mike, Opie and Anthony, and Ron and Fez is this station.  And we're back with the Opie and Anthony show, Godsmack. 
[02:12:30]  Bad magic.  We're going to be involved in a project.  Oh, with Godsmack.  Ah, details on the way.  And there's nothing Dave Dixless could do about it.  Hey, Dave, they're talking about you.  Hey, Dave, what, what do you say I do another one of those things where I break into your office and steal tickets to give away all week? 
[02:13:00]  Okay, rock hole.  All right, Dave.  Can I just plug something?  What?  I want to plug, you know how they have the, uh, I'm plugging something.  It's the new thing I'm starting.  Uh, they're doing, you know how they do all the Seinfeld tours.  I'm actually doing, and I've started this up.  It's the Madonna abortion stop tour.  Okay.  We go to different, the 11 different spots where we had them.  It includes two bedspreads, two taxi cabs, and seven linoleum floors. 
[02:13:30]  I've been on that type of tour before.  They're kind of, they're kind of fun.  Kind of cute.  I was on the Graveline tour once.  You went on the Graveline tour.  That was the one where, uh, they drive around L.A. and, uh.  And show you where all the famous people died.  You're in a hearse when they do it.  And all the locals that are all, you know, Hollywood stars, they give you the fingers as they drive by.  They're all pissed off.  They hate this guy.  And it's one of the best things you can do in L.A.  Graveline tours.  Uh, I saw where Fred Mertz dropped dead of a heart attack.  William Frawley. 
[02:14:00]  Hey, Rick, I'm going to drop dead.  Why, sure, Fred.  Fred, get off, Fred.  Can't, Rick, I'm dead.  We should get the guy that, uh, runs his tour on the line.  Lucy, leave little Ricky with Mrs. Trumbull, because Fred's dead.  Come watch.  Neither can a fat asshole.  Happened on Hollywood Boulevard.  He just dropped dead coming out of a movie, right?  Yeah, after a movie premiere.  What year?  Oh, my God.  I believe the, uh, 19 before I was born. 
[02:14:30]  The movie was Jay Moore's Mafia, so I don't think it was that long ago.  Oh, oh, oh.  What?  And then they take you where the Manson thing happened and, uh, where O.J. did his thing.  And, uh, Marilyn Monroe, uh, died in the bungalow there.  Um, and then they did something pretty funny.  They're outside George Burns' house.  And it was like, well, why are we stopping here?  And he's like, well, it's a coming attraction.  Because he was really sick at, he was really sick at the time. 
[02:15:00]  Why, why is, why is the hearse outside?  Right.  The sense of humor.  Perhaps I should just crawl out there.  I said, I'm not ready yet.  Right.  Go away.  I'm not there yet.  The sense of humor this guy had, it was, I, I highly recommend it if you're in L.A.  How much was it?  I don't know.  Like, hmm.  It was a lot.  Was it?  You're in a hearse.  They, they have all intros and music that's playing while you're pulling up to these places.  Like theme songs for the various shows.  All of a sudden they're doing the Bewitched theme.  Da, da, da, da, da.  Here's where a homosexual, uh, what's his name? 
[02:15:30]  Who was the one, uh, the Uncle Arthur?  Paul Linn.  Oh, that was Paul Linn.  Paul Linn.  Yeah, he, uh, he, he died.  They must have showed that.  Oh, he did the poppers or something.  No, we drove by, uh, Paul Linn's house where he died.  Yeah, he died, uh, pleasuring himself and choking himself.  Auto-erotic asphyxiated.  That's right.  Sam, I need to auto-erotic asphyxiate myself.  Is that how he died?  Yeah.  Yeah.  He was, uh.  Yeah, Betty.  They say that's, uh, kind of good if you're, uh, spanking it and you choke yourself right 
[02:16:00]  to the point where you're ready to pass out as you, uh, do that.  As you, uh, complete the act.  It was supposed to be unreal, but you're not supposed to pass out because then you just  choked to death.  Dying like that is almost as degrading as being on the Hollywood Squares.  I know.  He did it in the center square.  Center square.  I'm gonna die, Sammy.  I heard that from Japanese people.  Like, there are certain Japanese guys that will engage in that type of behavior, but  not with themselves, but with a goose.  And at the moment of finishing, if you choke a goose to death, the contractions tighten 
[02:16:30]  up.  Snap a goose neck.  Yes.  It might feel quite lovely.  Then we serve as General's house chicken with cream sauce.  Wonderful.  Wonderful.  Fur.  Goose choking.  Nice.  Cholking the goose.  Man, Adam Buckman from the Post.  Yeah.  Yeah.  He needs something.  He needs to find something to write about.  He did a whole article on the fact that, uh, William Shatner farted during an interview. 
[02:17:00]  Yeah.  I was looking at that.  What is it?  There's a video.  Oh, wow.  There's so much going on in the world, and he felt like he had to take up his space in  the Post today talking about Captain Kirk farting.  There's some video out there.  Wait a minute.  You just talked about choking a goose and Captain Kirk farting disgusts you?  No, I was writing about it, guys.  Oh, okay.  There's a video out.  It's called the Mind Meld Secrets Behind the Voyage of a Lifetime.  And it's, uh, William Shatner and Leonard Nimoy sitting around, they're both 70 years old, 
[02:17:30]  uh, waxing poetic about, uh, the Star Trek days, exchanging stories.  Um, and, and apparently 50 minutes into this, uh, William Shatner is, is asked, uh, about  his co-star, uh, Leonard Nimoy.  And he just kind of does the one-cheek thing, and, uh, lets one go out of nowhere.  He just lets one go and doesn't miss a beat. 
[02:18:00]  And, um, then they just keep going on, but this guy was fascinated by it, I guess.  Among other highlights, Nimoy reveals how Star Trek drove him to drink and to a shrink.  And Shatner, get this, discloses that he had no idea that other cast members disliked  him so intensely.  Both men confessed that the long hours they worked on Star Trek wrecked their marriages.  Hey, Bill, you weren't on Star Trek your whole life. 
[02:18:30]  Yeah, I think banging a green lady kind of wrecked your marriage.  How about a pool wrecked one of them?  I thought the fart was air bubbles from her.  Oh!  My God, I can't believe my wife fell in a pool.  Let me jet propel myself to her.  Look at me go.  I'm hitting warp five.  Ah!  At his age, he probably didn't even realize he did it.  That's why he just kept on going.  Sick.  Security detail.  Phasers on stink. 
[02:19:00]  We're going down.  Ah!  I'll get you, you Klingon bastards.  Khan!  Oh, that was kind of good.  I feel like I have a Genesis device in my pants.  Eh?  I'll show you the trouble with Tribbles.  Oh, my.  Oh, Jesus.  Brother.  I can't believe it.  That's one of the most embarrassing moments ever when I went in the turbo lift and the beautiful Yeoman brand came in. 
[02:19:30]  I said, you're a beautiful woman.  Okay, drop me off here.  Sick bay, I need some antacid.  I couldn't help it.  I opened a comlink and Opie yelled at me.  I lost my faculties. 
[02:20:00]  Remember the episode Spock's Brain?  We found his brain.  He had no sense of smell.  So he never noticed I was falling away.  A little bit.  I'll show you Harry Mudd.  I lost my little cut.  So, yeah, I guess that made Adam Buckman laugh a little bit. 
[02:20:30]  The fact that he farts in this.  And now people will buy it just because he farts, I bet.  I got to see it.  I kind of, I was a huge fan of the old series.  So I'll watch it.  I'll watch it.  Look, my underwear looks like Uhura.  Oh, my.  Wow.  Photon torpedoes flying out my butt.  Klingon bastard killed my son. 
[02:21:00]  Space.  My butt, the final frontier.  These are the origins of my butt.  To boldly go where no man ever wants to go.  My butt.  We're circling the planet emeroid.  To seek out...  I'm not even going with the Uranus joke.  Shut up.  To boldly go where no man has gone before.  I will now engulf myself in my own cloaking device. 
[02:21:30]  A green cloud like SETI Alpha 6.  I guess it is kind of funny.  Bones.  I need something for this problem.  Dammit, Jim.  You're crap done.  No, it's not Regis.  It's Captain Kirk. 
[02:22:00]  Shut up.  Regis and he...  Oh, my God.  I can't believe it, Kelvin.  I'm farting.  Jerry, what's going on?  Man, I'm drinking a Coke and he says faces on stink and I went right through my...  That hurts, man.  What happened?  Coke went through your nose?  I'm drinking through...  I'm drinking a Coke and he says faces on stink.  The thing blew out right all over the dashboard.  That hurts. 
[02:22:30]  Got to try to keep that Coke in your nose, all right?  Oh, man.  Hey, ask him if Shatner has a glass table.  Yeah, like Rocky.  I have to blast off some Klingons.  There they go.  Like the episode, the Corbomite Maneuver.  That's how he cleared out the caves.  The Corbomite Maneuver.  Blythe.  Come in. 
[02:23:00]  Come in.  Hello?  Open up a hailing frequency to Blythe.  Yes.  I'm right here.  Yes.  What's up, Blythe?  I hear you.  When are you guys coming to D.C.?  We've got to kind of build a following down there.  Yeah.  You've got one.  Nah, you know, a lot of people are a little pissed off that...  I didn't dig you at first.  I'm a nerd.  I used to listen to G. Gordon Liddy, and when they moved Don and Mike and took G. Gordon  Liddy off, I was a little hot under the collar.  Well, you know, the market down there in the city, it's in turmoil because they moved  the radio shows around and stuff, so we're just kind of letting everything settle, and 
[02:23:30]  hopefully we'll build an audience, and we'll get down there.  Well, when you come down, you've got to bring Dice.  I'm, like, obsessed with him now.  Are you?  Earl is doing a sticker stopper.  Yeah, I'm, like, working on my voice, trying to imitate him.  Oh, yeah?  Let's hear.  Let's hear your Dice.  I'm over here now.  That's stunk.  It's, like, Dice after a kick in the nuts.  Yeah.  But you're getting there, I guess.  Do you do the crazy Dice?  No.  I'm just starting. 
[02:24:00]  The Dice that goes, oh, I'm sorry.  Can you do Ann B. Davis having her mouth assaulted by a Negro?  That's one of my favorite impressions, actually.  All right.  And you've got to bring Neil Diamond, too.  All right, Blythe.  Okay.  We'll get down there.  Thank you.  Okay, bye.  Goodbye.  All right.  Captain Kirk on the line?  No.  Oh, why are you calling yourself Captain Kirk?  Because everybody seems to have a nickname for your show anymore. 
[02:24:30]  So you just want to be Captain Kirk?  I just wanted to be Captain Kirk.  It has nothing to do with your little Star Trek thing.  But as you guys know, Bart is always funny radio.  Bart is always funny.  Always funny radio.  Now, check it out, guys.  Did anybody see the Kilbourn show last night?  No.  No.  I think her name's Mia Chow.  Oh, that chinky girl there.  Yeah, from ER.  From ER.  She was pretty hot.  Yeah, she is pretty hot.  But she gave the world a wow.  What do you mean?  She was wearing a flinky little dress.  And it was really loose on the front, you know? 
[02:25:00]  Hey, dude.  What keeps beeping in the background?  It's my cordless phone.  Are you filming a Ricola commercial?  Are you on a heart-lung machine?  I thought he was Captain Kirk.  And, like, it was just some ship sound effect.  No, you know, he was the first captain that could only communicate with the lights.  Oh, Captain Christopher Pike must be behind him.  Yep.  They had just picked him up.  He's saying yes.  He's saying yes because he's all burnt up.  He's in that encased chair.  One beep for yes, two for no.  Captain Pike, do you want to go back to the planet? 
[02:25:30]  He does.  Yes, he does, with the hiney-headed aliens that gave him everything.  Captain Pike, is this guy a tool?  Yeah, yeah.  Is there an end to your story?  Yes, there is an end.  So, anyway, she leans forward and you get a full frontal of her left breast.  Full.  And the producer must have been going nuts for the show because they kept cutting from different scenes, you know?  And she wouldn't, it didn't help.  It didn't help any little bit because she kept leaning forward and it was just, it was, you got nipple all over the place. 
[02:26:00]  And then what happened?  She sucked on five questions.  Captain Pike, are you falling asleep?  No, I'm not falling asleep.  Yes, I heard the beep.  Captain Christopher McIntyre.  That's my other line.  He fell asleep.  Yeah.  All right, well, that's, that was a great little ditty, yeah.  Yeah, I just talked to the radio, I'll never be a DJ.  All right.  You guys rock.  Norton, you're hilarious.  All right.  Bye.  Later.  He's all dejected at the end later.  Well, it was good, though.  It was fine.  Oh, wow.  It was worth wasting three minutes of national radio. 
[02:26:30]  Trying to think of how to make 13 episodes out of that and get a show.  So, Sergeant Hartman's calling us tomorrow?  Yeah.  All right, right.  Gunner, it's Sergeant Hartman.  We've got to play, uh, the prank calls for him.  I can't do anything.  Good night, ladies.  Hold on.  Spaceman wants in.  Pray.  Spaceman, what's up?  Hey, how you doing?  What's up?  Listen, when you mentioned about Paul Lynn, it brought to mind something that happened 
[02:27:00]  back in Westchester in the early 90s.  There was a spate, a spate of high school boys found dead, and the cops went, fits, trying  to figure it out.  All hung, all because of that.  But the whole trip was that the mommies would come home, find a kid hanging in the closet,  and clean up all the Playboys so that nobody would know what was really going on.  And it took the cops like three months.  Boop.  I think he's right, though, about that story.  I remember salivating hearing that. 
[02:27:30]  The way he was telling it, oof.  All right, well, we're going to obviously take a break and regroup.  Strapping young nude books.  Hanging in that closet.  Well hung in the closet.  Sergeant Hartman, though.  Looking forward to that.  Prank call with the clips from Full Metal Jacket.  So we thought you weren't tattooing.  Well, no s***.  What's your name, Fat Buddy?  Hello.  What's your name, Fat Buddy?  F*** you, buddy.  What have we got here? 
[02:28:00]  A f***ing comedian?  Yep.  Do you think I'm cute?  Do you think I'm funny?  Hell no.  Do you suck a f***?  Used to.  Gave it up.  I'll bet you could suck a golf ball through a garden hole.  Yeah, I probably could.  I'll bet you're the kind of guy that would f*** a person and s*** to not even have the  goddamn comment, Curtis, and you give him a reach around.  No, I don't eat s*** like you.  Jeez, man.  I love those things.  Rick, give me another one.  The Christian one's pretty good, right? 
[02:28:30]  Yeah.  He needs a few more cuts in there, like a few more lines.  It's not bad, though.  Has that guy ever played anything other than a military man?  Yes.  He has?  He was a mayor in Mississippi Burning.  Wasn't he?  Oh, yeah, right, right, right, right.  No, he usually plays like the military, or the cop.  He was Romeo in Shakespeare in the Park.  Juliet!  What is your major malfunction?  You Capulet!  All right, here's one more as we take a break. 
[02:29:00]  A Christian radio show, I believe.  Christian Counseling, this is Darrell.  What's your name, fat buddy?  Who's this?  Dormit Pyle.  Gomer Pyle.  Do you like that name?  It's a wonderful name.  Do you think I'm cute?  Do you think I'm funny?  Yeah.  Ah!  Are you about to call me an ass?  Yes, I am.  I thought I'd never hear from Gomer Pyle.  What have we got here?  Comedian.  Hey, what's your language?  You're on the National Airwaves here.  Do you suck?  Goodbye. 
[02:29:30]  O.B. and Anthony.  And on the eighth day, God said, let there be brass.  Boobs.  Wow.  You're checking out the O.B. and Anthony show.  Oh, yeah.  Whip him out Wednesday.  It was a huge success once again today.  Thank you, ladies.  People love seeing the female form.  By complete surprise.  You just put the wow on your vehicle.  And before you know it, there's a girl next to you showing her luscious hands to you. 
[02:30:00]  That's all it takes.  Everyone's a winner.  Alex from the City writes, is Adam Farrar there?  If he is, ask him what the hell happened to the job.  That was a really funny show.  We come back November 7th.  We're going to premiere with NYPD Blue.  Oh, look at that.  See?  Yeah.  That's my pal, Dan.  Hit TV show.  Shoot.  Look at that. 
[02:30:30]  And one day, they're going to lock me up.  Shoot.  Yeah.  Everyone wants to be a perp on his show.  On Adam's show.  Who doesn't, though?  Can you get us in there?  Sure.  That's a great role.  All the guest appearances like a perp.  I'd be good.  I'd be like the guy on the Stevie Wonder song.  Come on.  Come on.  Get in that cell.  Get in the cell.  I just want to walk across the street in the background.  And do that little walk on.  Yeah.  That's all I want to do.  I do it when we shoot live because people don't care.  We're shooting this TV show. 
[02:31:00]  Lady Schmitty.  Have you guys had to alter anything?  Any shots that we're taking?  No.  Any storylines?  None of that stuff.  Good.  Thank God.  Yeah.  Getting tired of that.  Everybody's altering stuff.  They're canceling movies.  They're removing the World Trade Center from movies.  That's ridiculous.  Just leave everything alone.  Well, I mean, you don't want to be sitting in a movie having a good time and see the World  Trade Center and go, oh, God.  You can do it anyway.  Yeah, it's part of history now. 
[02:31:30]  You know, you've got to kind of leave it there.  Not yet.  It's still too soon.  You can't watch a movie with Humphrey Bogart in it because he's gone?  Yeah.  Nobody flew a plane into Humphrey Bogart to try to attack our society.  Close.  Close.  Close.  Well, he ducked.  I think they should leave it in.  Hey, you watch movies now.  It's in New York.  All right.  They show them in the background.  So, are they going to remove it from all those movies?  Just leave it in there.  You make a new movie, it's gone.  There.  Done. 
[02:32:00]  You agree with me?  Sure you do, Adam.  Okay.  Let's move on.  We should play, what did we learn?  Because there's a lot of really good ones coming in.  What did we learn today on this educational smorgasbord?  Danny's going to get us started.  Danny, what's up?  Okay.  Learn this.  One beef means yes.  Two beef means no.  And three beefs for every word out of Norton's mouth.  And one more thing, guys.  Hello?  Yeah. 
[02:32:30]  Okay.  Remember those old commercials with syndication when Opie gives me a ring from Sandy?  Time to pay up.  Are you being held hostage somewhere?  Now you guys won't even talk.  That whole abortion thing makes sense now.  It's Danny, one of Madonnas that crept out.  Did they do retroactive ones?  Pulled through.  Dennis, what's going on? 
[02:33:00]  What's up, guys?  Hey.  I learned that to become a roaster at the Fires Club, Jeffrey Ross needs to put his hand  on your head and say, there, now you're a roaster.  That's good.  There you go.  Very good.  Thomas, you're next.  What's going on?  Hey, guys.  Hey.  I learned that Anthony would prefer to see Saudi junk when he flies.  And in order to blow steam, you've got to call him first.  Later, guys.  It was blow off some steam.  Well, whatever.  Derek, what's going on?  Hello.  Hey, guys.  Hey.  Yeah, I learned that Anthony used to handle Norton's junk. 
[02:33:30]  Oh, I forgot about that.  Peep show.  Yes.  No, I know.  I'm sorry.  You don't have to explain it.  Thank you.  All right.  This could be the best one of the day.  Sean, what did you learn on the show today?  I learned stalker Patty's sea dandruff worse than anthrax.  Yes.  Poo-pah.  Ah, poof-pah.  Nice.  Uncle John.  Hey, guys.  How you doing?  All right.  I learned a few things today.  I learned that Anthony prefers step-and-fetch-a type washroom attendants.  I learned that Tim Sabian's friends wear laughing hats. 
[02:34:00]  Yeah.  Let's see.  I learned that sexual abuse is preferable to physical abuse.  Yeah.  I had a quick suggestion, guys.  Clean the office thoroughly because I read somewhere that stalker Patty's urine may contain anthrax.  Anthrax.  Oh.  Hey, that's good.  Good anthrax.  That's just in.  Tim Sabian's writing a cute wedding bit for the show.  Oh, great.  A cute fake wedding bit.  Hey, that's a good idea.  Bruce, what's going on?  Hey, I learned today that don't eat that yellow snow because that's where stalker Patty goes. 
[02:34:30]  Okay.  All right.  I also learned that one boob wow story is boring.  One boob wow story.  Okay.  The guy that called up earlier.  Have a good one, guys.  All right.  Let's go to Mike.  Hey, Mike, you're next on the show.  Yo, what's going on, fellas?  Hey.  Yo, I learned two things today.  Yeah.  First thing is that Opie has the ability to yell loud enough to make stalker Patty leak herself.  Yeah.  And the second thing, it goes hand in hand, that girls leaking themselves, always funny. 
[02:35:00]  Yeah.  Thanks, fellas.  Always.  You guys are the best.  Always.  I learned that Madonna has an abortion punch out card and the 12th one is free.  Yeah.  Peter.  Hey.  Hey.  So, I learned three things today.  Yeah.  Milton Berle has famous junk.  Yeah.  ONA, enjoy gay guys.  And canned laughter, always funny.  Always funny.  Always funny.  Good job, bro.  Enjoy.  He used the term enjoy. 
[02:35:30]  Isaac.  Yeah.  I thought the word enjoy was a very safe word.  It was very safe.  It was very safe.  We enjoy gay guys.  It's not that we love them.  It's not that we like them.  We enjoy.  Okay.  You mean many different things, right?  Yeah.  I hope.  Isaac, what's up?  Today, I learned that the super lady with the power of urine has an arch enemy named Spud's  Terkel.  Yeah.  Just when you thought Stark and Patty as an ant was funny, now it's on a whole new level 
[02:36:00]  with the super lady.  Super lady.  That is what you said, right?  Yeah.  I'm not super lady of Wonder Woman.  I want to hear some more Spud's Terkel, guys.  I'll see you later.  All right.  Bye.  I'm so glad.  Freud writes, I learned Tim Sabian is a men's room attendant at the Friars Club.  Anthony is capable of washing and drying his hands all by himself.  This one coming in a lot.  I learned Stark and Patty has dandruff in her pubic hair.  Can't laugh, they're always funny. 
[02:36:30]  And Stark and Patty is really just a clever disguise for super lady.  Jacob, I learned today girls leaking themselves is always funny.  Jerry writes today, I learned Anthony went to the Friars Club because he couldn't get into  the stairwell.  Call back from yesterday's show.  Making fun of tarts, always cool.  Captain Kirk has his phaser set on stink.  And Park's still always funny.  Anthony thinks mule is great.  Did I say that at some point today? 
[02:37:00]  Who knows?  How does that happen?  Johnny Medic, good show today.  Tools.  Here's what I learned.  Chelsea is the only place in the world where they rent knee pads.  Stark or Patty doesn't know what punctuation or bladder control is.  Norton talks like a registered sex offender.  And Madonna's birth canal looks like Kabul.  And let's go to Dave.  Dave, what did you learn today?  I learned that Stark or Patty now smells like everyone at the Friars Club.  Hey, syndication when the Mets and the Islanders win a championship, you tool. 
[02:37:30]  Help me out a little bit.  Come on.  Jay, what's going on?  What's up?  Hey.  Yo, guys, they'll never defeat us.  We won't abort this mission.  When we pull our planes out of those hangers, oh, baby, it's going to be a bloody war.  Oh, no, it's the old baby.  Yeah, I learned something else.  Yeah.  Super Lady Stalker Patty lives in a giant yellow castle at the North Pole.  It keeps getting bigger and bigger.  Palace of pee-pee. 
[02:38:00]  You're real nice.  That was some funny stuff.  Good job.  Peace.  All right.  I think we're just about done.  The gays in San Francisco will never forget the KY and KYCY.  KYCY.  I forgot about that call earlier.  That was where the enjoying gay people came in.  That was the enjoyable.  Sure.  Chris, what's going on?  Not much.  How are you guys doing?  Good.  We're kind of limping to the finish line here.  Help us out.  I learned there's a new setting for phasers.  Yeah. 
[02:38:30]  Bart jokes, always funny.  Yeah.  And finally, I can't get a wow if my life depended on it.  In where?  Philly?  Yeah.  The new cities, it's going to take time.  In New York, it works like a charm.  Yep.  Just give it time.  Just put the wow in the back of your car and go about your business and it'll happen,  all right?  Yeah, I'm doing that, bud.  Either that or go to our road show next Wednesday at the Electric Factory.  You'll see a lot.  I'll try to make it there.  All right, Chris.  Thank you.  Bye.  Let's go to Angie.  Angie, what's up?  Hey, O&A.  I learned three things today. 
[02:39:00]  Hey, racial profiling can get you excellent game tickets.  Yeah.  Just because you're gay doesn't mean you're not still a guy and the war will not be aborted.  You guys suck.  All right, good job.  This one makes me chuckle right here.  Joe, what's up?  Hey, guys.  Hey.  When Patty gets on her knees at night, she faces Mecca and calls to Allah.  Oh, and after 11 abortions, you may need a stapler or something like that.  Yeah.  Something like that.  Nice.  Later, guys.  That or a crunchy.  Yeah, something like that. 
[02:39:30]  All right.  We might as well leave with a Hartman call because we have stumbled to the finish line here.  Got more tickets to give away?  Can we do it now?  How many pairs?  No, no, no?  Five.  Yeah.  All right.  We got five more pairs of tickets to see.  Jane's Addiction at the Continental Arena on Tuesday, October 16th.  If you want to go, call us now.  A few tickets are still available through all Ticketmaster outlets.  Okay?  Any final words?  Plugs?  No.  Norton?  No?  No.  What happened to the energy?  Joe, you're playing, right?  Yeah.  But Joe, with the good rats at the Stadium Cafe, Route 3, Secaucus, New Jersey. 
[02:40:00]  That's right.  Friday night.  Friday night.  Nice.  Adam?  10-30.  Eat your vegetables.  That's right.  Eat your vegetables.  That's your plug.  That's my message for today.  Sit up straight.  Watch the job.  All right.  Oh, on the show tomorrow, Brian Regan.  Brian.  One of our faves.  And a guy that does Brian Regan really well, Frank Caliendo.  Dueling Regans.  The guy from Mad TV.  Dueling Regans.  And they have no idea each other's going to be here, so it should be fair.  Oh, no.  Caliendo's also the guy that does the great John Madden and the Pacino and all those guys. 
[02:40:30]  And we love Brian Regan, so it's going to be a lot of fun tomorrow.  This way he can say, you do a good Regan.  You too.  You too.  You too.  All right.  And, okay, we'll end with Caliendo dueling Ted Nights with Anthony.  We'll see you guys tomorrow.  I Ted Nighted it.  We're the naked cowboy.  Oh, no.  Spalding, I want you with a golf course in five minutes. 
[02:41:00]  Chop, chop.  Come on.  Come on, Anthony.  We've got to go back and forth.  Did you hear the one about the colored boy?  No.  Go ahead.  No, I heard that one.  That's a hoot.  Wait a second.  You be Ted Nights.  Wait.  Wait.  I almost said the wrong word.  You screwed up.  I screwed up.  Who screwed up?  I did.  Okay.  You be Ted Baxter.  I'll be the guy from Too Close for Comfort.  It's easy to grin when your ship comes in and you've got the stock market beat, but the 
[02:41:30]  man that's worthwhile is the man that can smile when his shorts are too tight in the seat.  Okay, Pookie, Chris, and the boat.  Wait a second.  I think Monroe wants to see the cowboy.  Monroe.  Naked cowboy.  Here.  Now.  Lou.  Lou.  Lou.  Mary.  Mary.  Mary.  Thanks, Mary.  Lou.  Let them hang.
