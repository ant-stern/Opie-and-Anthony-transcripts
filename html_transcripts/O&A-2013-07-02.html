<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast covered a wide range of topics, starting with Sam Roberts filling in for the vacationing Opie and Anthony, showcasing a "Worst of 2013 So Far" compilation.  A highlight was Opie's prank call to Barry Williams (Greg Brady), detailing multiple visits to Williams' Bel Air home, including receiving leftover pasta.  The call itself was played, revealing Williams' initial surprise followed by amusement and renewed friendship with Opie.  

Next, the show featured Kevin Hart in studio. Hart discussed his *Saturday Night Live* experiences, both his successful hosting gigs and a previous failed audition.  He also boasted about his two NBA celebrity game MVP wins and shared anecdotes about his gambling habits.

The broadcast then shifted to a preview of Anthony's childhood Tijuana trips with his father, hinting at heavy drinking, dangerous driving, and witnessing questionable activities in bars.  This was followed by a caller recounting their own similar experiences traveling to Tijuana with a heavily drinking father, detailing dangerous driving, customs interactions, and a bar fight.

The show then transitioned to a studio interview with Vanilla Ice, who promoted his home renovation TV show, "The Vanilla Ice Project,"  discussed his career shift from music to real estate, and his acquisition of "Under Pressure's" publishing rights.  Humorous banter ensued, touching upon drug use and the evolution of music sampling.

The conversation then moved to a Patrice O'Neal tribute show, with Bill Burr and Colin Quinn in studio. The hosts and guests discussed the planning and execution of the event, focusing on the comedic personalities involved and the challenges of coordination.  This discussion led to a conversation about the successful, limited-edition posters commemorating the show and a mishap with one of the signers, Voss, who signed directly on the artwork. David Tell, a studio guest, praised the show’s success while criticizing one comedian’s poorly received poem repeatedly mentioning "black star."

A phone interview with Penn Jillette followed, promoting his new ice cream flavor for *Celebrity Apprentice*.  The hosts sampled the ice cream, engaging in humorous banter about its taste, Jillette’s chances of winning, and his competitors' flavors.  The conversation touched on Jillette’s *Celebrity Apprentice* experiences with contestants like LaToya Jackson and Dennis Rodman, the ice cream production process, and anecdotes about filming and editing.  Jillette also discussed legal challenges faced while filming *Bullshit*, specifically an incident involving ducks and a chiropractor, and his strategies to avoid lawsuits while using offensive language. The conversation concluded with stories involving Amway presentations and timeshare sales pitches.

A significant portion of the show focused on the *Celebrity Apprentice* ice cream challenge between Penn Jillette and Trace Adkins, with Adkins as a studio guest. The hosts extensively compared both contestants, mocking Jillette’s ice cream and imitating Adkins’ deep voice.  Numerous anecdotes about Adkins's life, including serious injuries and near-death experiences (being shot by his ex-wife and surviving a house fire), were recounted.  Listeners called in with additional anecdotes about Adkins’s survival stories.  Offensive language, including racial slurs and homophobic remarks, was frequently used, along with discussions of Jillette’s perceived Jewishness and Adkins’ religiosity.  The hosts also discussed Donald Trump’s role and speculated on the winner.  The segment concluded with a comparison of the contestants' perceived strengths and weaknesses.

Trace Adkins further discussed his career, transitioning from oil rigs to music, his heavy partying, and his charitable work.  Guy Fieri also appeared in studio, engaging in banter with the hosts and Adkins about Fieri's height, culinary career, and book.  A phone call with "Lady Di," a recurring character, was played, revealing a conversation nearly identical to one from nine years prior, showcasing her unchanging lifestyle of unemployment, alcohol consumption, and reliance on others.  The hosts and Lady Di engaged in a humorous yet confrontational exchange. Colin Quinn and Tom Papa were also mentioned as being in studio, though their contributions were minimal in this excerpt.


Finally, a separate segment focused on a phone call with "Di" (or possibly "Dee"), where the hosts relentlessly mocked her nine-year unemployment, questioning her work history and lifestyle choices.  They played a clip from nine years prior showing her consistent unemployment. The conversation centered on her job search for a Family Dollar cashier position, with the hosts engaging in sexually suggestive and crude remarks.  A man named Bill, present in Di's house, was briefly mentioned. Details about Di's past employment were discussed, and the hosts' mockery continued due to her evasive and contradictory responses. The segment concluded with the hosts' amusement at her situation and the discovery of the nearly identical phone call from nine years prior.

[00:00:00]  Shocking admissions  James Lipton  A pimp is somebody who exploits the women who work for him  I was a tour guide, I would say you want to see some sex  Shit-faced buffoonery  E-Rock drank all the Patron  Everything is blurry  And whatever this is  Normally I like a couple fingers up my ass  What the fuck happened?  Relive six months of ONA in just one short week  Opie and Anthony's worst of 2013 so far  Start now  Yeah! 
[00:00:30]  Welcome to day two of the worst of 2013  So far with me, Sam Roberts from the Opie and Anthony show  Opie and Anthony are on vacation this week  I'm not on vacation  You're not on vacation  So I thought we should share with you  The worst of 2013  So far, by worst we mean best  It's just something cute that we do  It's been a huge year for the Opie and Anthony show  Big enough that only six, seven months in  We have to do a week-long celebration of everything that's happened so far this year 
[00:01:00]  Just today  We're going to get to a recap of the Patrice O'Neal tribute show that happened  The return of Lady Di on the Opie and Anthony show  Penn Jillette  Trace Atkins  Vanilla Ice  And a whole lot more  But what I want to start with is, to me, a very hilarious moment  Opie, it was, Anthony was running late one morning  I was in studio along with Opie  And he realized that he hadn't spoken to his friend, Barry Williams, a.k.a. Greg Brady 
[00:01:30]  In quite some time  However, he had Barry Williams' cell phone number in his phone  Now, it's been maybe five years since he's talked to him  So we don't know if the phone number's going to work  We don't know if he's going to pick it up  We don't know what he's doing  So Opie decided, at about 6.25 in the morning, New York time  To give Barry Williams a cold call  And see how he was doing  This is how it turned out  On the worst of 2013, so far  Opie and Anthony's worst of 2013 
[00:02:00]  So far  Paul Anka friendship is way better than a Greg Brady friendship  Yeah  Yeah  I should have called him last night and see if he wanted to go see Colin with you  Maybe I could check out Bel Air again  I bet you can get  That's where Greg Brady used to live  You can get  With his very  What happened?  Why doesn't he live in Bel Air anymore?  Well, you know, he got a divorce  And I learned over the years that  He might have been living in Bel Air because of his wife  Oh, no  His wife had money 
[00:02:30]  Maybe she became the breadwinner after  The Brady Bunch reunions dried up  He lived in Bel Air at the top of one of those mountains  Overlooking everything  Not anymore  That was a past tense live  Everything  But he invited me over to his house  Gave me his address and everything  That's sick  I remember being in L.A.  Driving up this mini mountain in Bel Air  Looking at the numbers of the houses  You know, trying to find where Greg Brady lives  And I called 
[00:03:00]  I called a really good friend of mine  Freaking out like a little fucking schoolgirl  I'm going to Greg Brady's house  I'm like, you're not going to believe this  What?  I'm driving to Greg Brady's house  I had to tell people  I'm going to tell someone now  And then I called  Look, Brady Bunch is on TV as I speak  Or some weird fucking commercial for the Brady Bunch  Or some fucking  They're using a Mr. Brady clip for some  Publishers clearinghouse  Is that what that is?  Yeah  Anyway, so then I called family members  I started calling everyone I know 
[00:03:30]  As I was getting closer to Greg Brady's house  I needed everyone to know where I was heading  Where are you at right now?  Yeah, I'm just  Right  I'm just on my way to Greg Brady's house  And then I parallel parked in front of a ridiculous looking house  And then I walked up to the gates  And I had to push the button  And then he's on the other end  I'm like, hey, Barry, it's Opie 
[00:04:00]  Oh, you made it, great  Let me budge you in  And then I'm just gulping as I'm walking up the sidewalk  Going, I'm walking into Greg Brady's house  It was the most surreal thing ever  It was so fucked up  Did he have Brady Bunch memorabilia on display?  Oh, yeah  A lot of it?  Yeah, but he had the Brady Bunch episodes  I remember  He had all his Brady Bunch episodes on VHS tapes  I always thought that was strange  Is he watching them?  Hey, honey, let's put it in another  This was about ten years ago  But, I mean, people were definitely, you know 
[00:04:30]  In the DVD world?  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah  But I also thought if you're Greg Brady  And you were on the Brady Bunch  You know, they had other ways to, you know  Save this shit  Sure  But he was still in the VHS world  And we're all taped off TV  Right  So  And then I went back to Greg Brady's house another time  And that's when I had the famous leftovers  Because I kind of came unannounced  Hey, Greg!  My name's Barry  Yeah, Greg, all right, great  I went up there with my friend Jay 
[00:05:00]  Who moved out to L.A.  And I was out in L.A.  I'm like, hey, why don't we go say hi to Greg Brady?  Yeah  Why don't we go say hi?  I know where he lives  Don't even worry about it  Well, because at this point I'm like  Now I've got to take someone to Greg Brady's house  Of course  Now that I've been there  Now I've got to take someone else  And did he give you that open invite?  Like, hey, come back anytime  Yeah, so I called him  You said it  And he's a really nice guy  Well, when he came to New York  I had dinner with him as well  With a few people 
[00:05:30]  He's a really nice guy  I'm kind of bummed we've lost touch  Over the last few years  But anyway  So then I call him up  He goes, yes, come on over  We're about to, you know  Have a little dinner or something  I'm like, all right, great  So I went with my friend Jay  And he invited us in again  And we had cocktails out  Overlooking everything  With an infinity pool  Ridiculous spot  And then I remember being in his house  As him and his wife at the time  Were looking in the fridge  Trying to figure out  What they're going to 
[00:06:00]  Serve us  We've got to feed these guys  You didn't tell me they were coming  I didn't know they were coming  And Greg Brady had a beautiful  Like, pasta dish  Yeah  That was fresh  Freshly made  And his wife, same thing  And then I had  The leftovers  They didn't have enough pasta for you  I'd have to go back  Into the archives  Because I used to tell people  What I had that day  Do you remember, Iraq?  No, I don't  I think I remember  There was some kind of peas in it 
[00:06:30]  You'd be surprised, Opie  It's not delivery  It's DiGiorno  Right  But I do remember them  Looking into the fridge  And, you know  I remember thinking  Aw, fuck  They don't have enough food  And they're trying to figure out  What's cool enough  To serve me  Do you think this caused  Their divorce?  I don't know  I have no idea  What caused their divorce  Divorce  Your friends just keep showing up?  No, I only  I was only there  I think twice  Maybe three times  How did you lose touch?  It just time went by  And you just didn't talk to them? 
[00:07:00]  Yeah  Yeah  Yeah, I don't know  What happened with that  Well, you don't need them anymore  You have Paul Anka in your life  I mean, we were friends  But not friends' friends  Yeah  Like, I got friends  I haven't, you know  Like anyone else  I have friends  And you don't see them  For a bunch of years  And then all of a sudden  You see them  And you just pick up  Where you were  You should text them  We weren't on that level  You should text them again  And pretend you were  Yeah  Text them and be like  Yo, Barry, what up?  I don't  You know what?  I think I have his number  If it's still the same  I don't even know if it is  I'll be completely honest with you

[00:23:00]  Motivate myself  So I'm like  Okay  You think I'm scared of you man  Listen  Ain't no fear  In my heart  Okay  We both tie shoes  The same way  Let's boogie  Head up  So I'm playing  I'm like  You know  Just being personality  This guy is talking back  Oh yeah  Oh well you think  I don't wanna  Take your money  Took it  He's like  Took it  Swiped it  Uh oh  Got you again  Oh man  I'd lose my mind  He's like  Bang  He's putting out sound effects  And I'm really like  He's really doing  What he says he's gonna do 
[00:23:30]  Yeah  Would he have talked shit though  If you weren't talking or no  Do you think that was  No no no  He was just playing back with me  He knew I was  So he was just joking  Damn  But the fact that what he was saying  Was becoming a reality  Start  My jokes  Eventually just  Just went away  And I got quiet  Yeah  Yeah  Yeah  And all of a sudden  You're just like  Nah this ain't fucking funny  Not at all  Yeah  I'll just sit there  And go like  Really?  Really?  I guess  21 not even good enough  At this table right?  I guess not  I guess not  You know  21 against a 4  And then you just pull cards out 
[00:24:00]  Where?  Your ass?  Sir sir  Could you please  You know  Watch your language  Yeah  I'm not mad at the dealer  I'm mad at the cards  Okay  Yeah  These cards are a real cunt  A real ugly fucking cunt  The cards  It's really nice to see  Alcoholism and gambling addiction  Flare up at the same time  Yeah  He has a pillow  He has a pillow  He could yell into  I think we might have told you  All this last time 
[00:24:30]  Yeah  You told me about it again  That is hilarious  He punches pillows  He fights pillows  He yells at the pillows  It's like  Bam  Fuck  I saw Keith  Keith Robinson  We used to go to  Atlantic City  So Keith would literally  Be betting like  $10 or $15  A hand  So  You know  On the way home  Like I would have lost  Like at the time  I would lose like  $800 or $1,000  Which was a lot of money  So I was like  Man I can't believe  I just did it  So Keith  Keith used to just laugh  Stupid 
[00:25:00]  How they lost  $75  How they play  With $75  I love watching you  Lose all your little money  Stupid  Like he would purposely  Just not gamble a lot  Like he would win  Like $5, $50  But  Ow  Ow  Ow  Ow  Then he started  Like gambling more  But  His wins would always be 
[00:25:30]  Like  It would just be like  $75, $80  But  On the way home  The ride  Oh  He must have loved it  Yeah  Oh  Take these  80 smackies  And I'll buy some  I'll probably buy some  Shoes  Or some DVD  I'll buy some new DVDs  What are you gonna buy  Stupid  Oh that's right  That's right  You lost  Skippity-doos  With his awful dress pants  With too much shit  In the front pockets  Yeah  He just  I don't know 
[00:26:00]  I lost guys  Stuff's it all in the front pockets  He came back from gambling  We walked in the cell the other night  Or it was a podcast we were doing  He was in Niagara Falls  There was something gambling  And he won like a grand  Yeah  He's really  A thousand bucks  And you're feeling that good about it  Ow  I'm in the money  Thousand smackies  All time  Smackies  Smacky-doodle-dinkies  Little shoopity-boop  Like you can think  Listen  You can think that you'll laugh  For a long time  But I say  It gets you so mad  Oh yeah 
[00:26:30]  Like when Keith needles you  It gets you so mad  He's hateable  It's the dumbest  He's saying the dumbest shit  Yeah  Yeah  Oh  Doobity-bink boggles  Yeah  When you're playing chess with him  And he picks up  Don't touch my pieces  Don't pick up my queen  What color panda she got on  He's smack-talking during chess  Yes  Ow  Come on  Let me rub your pawn's titties  Ow  My pawn  Ow 
[00:27:00]  I want to know about SNL man  This is a big fucking deal  Man  You've gotten to do a lot of cool things obviously  Is this your number one?  Oh this is huge  It is right?  This is huge man  Especially as a comedian  To have the chance  To be a part of  You know  This is history for me  You know  And writing my book  And writing my path  This is a huge step  I talked to Lauren  Lauren for like two hours last night  We go to dinner  And literally just hearing the information 
[00:27:30]  The stories  And really understanding  The careers and lives  That he's affected  Like this  You know  When you think comedy  He's really been a part of  Putting  Putting today's names  That are huge  Monumental  In a theatrical sense  Comedic sense  Improvisational sense  They came through him  So many people did  It's like  Just his eye for it  And him understanding the process  Of why it takes so long  And he remembered that I auditioned 
[00:28:00]  And didn't get it  Like  Why I didn't get it  Yeah  It was  Why did he tell you you didn't get it?  I was awful  I was awful  You're bad  What characters did you do?  Listen  I did a  I did  Okay let me tell you something  And I'm going to probably talk about this  In my monologue  So I go  And I'm auditioning for SNL  And you know  They're like  You got to do characters  But I'm like  I don't have any  Impressions  I don't know how to do anybody  But you know  What characters do I do?  I just didn't understand  The sense of characters  Now  I'm seasoned  So I know characters  I can be different people  And joke  Whatever  So I'm like 
[00:28:30]  I guess I just got to figure out  Some impressions  So I did an impression  Of Avery Johnson  Right  Which  Which I  I soon learned  That a lot of white people  Didn't know  I was just going to ask you  He's an actor right?  No he's a coach  He's a basketball player now  He used to be  Oh man  So I found out  Nobody know who Avery Johnson was  Which  Which made me a little more angry  Because I'm like  You know  If you knew who he was  You would know how good of an impression  How good this is  Right  It's his  You know  But  I'm doing an impression  Of nobody  They're like  No we don't know  We don't do it 
[00:29:00]  So after that  I tried to do like  Denzel  But it sounded like  Me doing Denzel  So  It was bad  It was just bad  Maybe you should have started off  A little less obscure  But my energy was great  My energy was good  And I didn't have stage fright  I was just awful  And then he went  Wow  He said it's amazing  Basically to see me  Come as far as I've came  And  With so little to work with  Knowing that you have no  Knowing that you have no  Talent at all 
[00:29:30]  Kevin  It's amazing that you've gotten this far  So wait  What was your Denzel impression?  Do you still do it?  Oh my Denzel impression  Was just bad  You don't do it anymore  No  I told you  It's not even the impression  It's me saying  You remember when Denzel said this?  That's in my voice  Oh shit  Remember the small one  From Denzel  Hey  Here's Denzel training day  King Kong  Ain't got nothing on me  That sounded like you  Just saying what he said  No  No  That's Denzel  That's Denzel  What year did you audition?  Oh man  This was like 2004 
[00:30:00]  2005  It came down between me  And Dean Edwards  And Dean Edwards got it  They never used Dean right either  Because Dean did an amazing rock  He did a great Denzel Washington  He had some great impressions  Fantastic  And I think that they did not use him properly  Or  He didn't do a great  Like a legit Michael Jackson too  He didn't do a hacky Michael Jackson  He did a great one  Here's my funny  Dean Edwards story  So the night that he gets SNL  He gets a call  And it was down to me and him  Right  So I'm like  Oh man  I might get it 
[00:30:30]  This is crazy  Oh shit  You know  Like Dave  My manager was like  Yeah Kevin  There was something about you  That he liked  So you know  Your impressions weren't great  But you did a good job  There is between you and Dean Edwards  I'm like  Oh this is  Oh man  You're thinking like  This could happen  This is gonna happen  This is gonna be the biggest thing ever  So Dean Edwards gets the call  He pulls me to the side  He's like  Yo man  He just called me  I got it  Now Dean is a friend of mine  So I'm happy  Like man  Congratulations Dean  This is huge for you man  This is gonna be great dude  So we go into the cellar  So me  Dean 
[00:31:00]  Tracy Morgan  Big J  And I think Keith might have been there too  We're all at the table  We're all eating  Dean just told everybody  Man congratulations  This is great  Chris Rock walks in  Chris comes in  Dean  Man I just heard you got SNL  Man this is great  Congratulations man  You gotta work hard though  You gotta write  Make sure you come in there  And you really put forth the effort  Tracy Morgan is at the other end of the table  He's eating  All you hear is Tracy's fork  It drops 
[00:31:30]  It drops like bangs against his plate  Right  So Tracy goes  I wish I had somebody to tell me shit like that  So Chris doesn't say anything  He just looks at Tracy  Right  Tracy says  And this is word for word  He says  I got blood on my knife  And shit on my walls  What the fuck  Picks up his food  And starts eating again  And Chris goes  Stay away from him  Yeah  Another good piece of advice  And just walks out 
[00:32:00]  And just walks out  Listen  But as Tracy said  I got blood on my knife  And shit on my walls  He said nothing else  And just  Just started eating  Just continued eating  Jesus  That was Dean Edwards' advice  He's facing these weird metaphors Tracy  And they make sense to him  They make sense to him  Shit on my walls  I was talking  I was walking in the cellar one night  And Tracy's there  And I said hello to him  And he goes  He goes  Gotta get that lunch pail  Go to work  Where do you want me to go with that  Where do I go with that  Yeah you do  Hi Tracy  Good to see you again 
[00:32:30]  What's the schedule for us now  Is it as brutal as they say  Where you guys are  Just up all the time  Just trying to get it all together  It's late night  Yeah late night  So you start  You know  Mid afternoon  And then you're going to about  1 a.m  Wow  You know  12 a.m  But the good thing is  It's just  It's just creative  It's non-stop  Ideas  Everybody's pitching  Everybody's coming  Because you know  Everybody has an equal chance  To get their sketches on  So there's a process 
[00:33:00]  You know  You can't just go  And yours is going to be picked  You got to do it  And write it  And get it up  And then there's a room  Where we see what's good  What's not good  And then there's a chopping board  And some things make it  Some things don't  Then last minute changes  It's constant  Is it up to you to pick  Some of them or  I'm not  I can go in and say  What I like the most  But I think the strongest  Overall sketches  For that particular episode  Of that night  Are the ones that  You ever hear somebody  Go like  Oh man  I'm going to tell you  It's funny 
[00:33:30]  So the first day  You know  I go in the room  And I sit out  And I'm there with Lauren  And all of the cast  All of the writers  All come in my room  And everybody  Tells you the ideas  They have for you  So you got to sit there  It's about 40 people  Wow  But everybody's going  Through the process  And it's funny  Because some people's  Pictures are bombing  Like you know  But the thing is  They let each other know  Like just like comedians  You know  Like somebody's like  Yeah  You can see people  Getting nervous  In the middle  And they see  It's not going well  So like 
[00:34:00]  And that's when  You'll like  You know  You'll do it  And then come in  And then somebody  Yell out  Should have reversed it  Should have  Should have went  With the other one first  And close with that  That shouldn't have  Been your closer  And they don't  Fake laugh though  No no no  That's better  It's all real  Good  All real  No fake laugh  Like when  When an idea  Is genuinely funny  It's funny  But they're all  Just rough ideas  And literally  Like all the people  You can tell  Who are the writers  And who are the personalities 
[00:34:30]  Because you know  The writers are very bland  Well it's like  You're a funny guy  So  This will work  Yeah yeah  You'll go into  A little bar  And you'll talk  Right  But you're the guy  Who just repeats  What the other person says  And you do it  Louder than them  And then you get mad  And then  Maybe  It's  Whatever  It's just an idea  So  That's how it is  Have you pitched any  Like one you felt like  Hey this should be  Kind of funny  Yeah 
[00:35:00]  I had a couple  That I pitched out  Did it bomb  Or did it do okay  Nah I'm pretty fucking  Amazing  Well I can  I think you'll be  A good host  I think Kevin  Will be a really good host  It's going to be fun  This is going to be fun  Christoph Waltz  Bieber  Like they're not stand ups  I mean have a stand up  This is going to be  A lot of fun  And it's my element  Like  This is what I love to do  So from improv  From the  The sketches  From literally  Creating these  These  These  These environments  And we're all  You know  We can be who we want to be  And they allow me to bring 
[00:35:30]  What I want to bring  To the table  And the live doesn't get you  I don't know  That makes it more exciting  Right right  That makes it more exciting  Yeah and it's not  It's not at all  Physically nauseating  To hear him saying  This is my element  This is where I  Oh Jimmy  But I do think  I think he'll be  A great host man  And I think  You'll pull a sketch  If a sketch  Isn't working  Because sometimes man  One thing they never do  On that show  And I admire it  Is they never  Wreck this sketch  When it's bombing  Which as a stand up  Is so hard  To not  Acknowledge the bomb  And you know  How we will get out 
[00:36:00]  Of a bomb  By just acknowledging it  And mocking it  They stay in it  Fucking full steam ahead  They never break  Sudeikis is really funny  He's been  He's been having me  On the floor  Seth is smart man  Like you know  Yeah he's really good  He's one of the head writers  But he's great  Like literally  Literally I respect  His work ethic  Kenan  Kenan has had me laughing  A lot  And Bobby  Bobby's funny  But it's like literally  When you just see  The cast members  I had no idea  They literally  They create  Just as much as the writers 
[00:36:30]  Just as much as the other  Showrunners  Everybody is involved  In the creative process  Which I think is smart  Because you know  It makes everybody work hard  Because everybody's motivated  To get to  Yeah you have a piece of it  You know  It's pretty insane  I heard they're pretty welcoming  There too  Because you're really going  Into a club  Where everybody's a member  But you  But I hear they're very good  At making you comfortable  And feel welcome  The way that I feel now  I feel like  They're excited  I feel like they're excited  That I'm there  And there's like an energy  There's a great energy around 
[00:37:00]  And nobody's  Nobody's been afraid  To present things to me  But what did  What did catch me off guard  Is like you know  At one point  You're really questioning  Your talent  Because when they sit you  In the room  Like hey Kevin  So real quick  We just want to know  Some things  Do you sing?  I'm like no  No I don't sing  Do you do any  Impersonations?  No  No  I don't have any  Impersonations  You dance?  Nah  You see them  Checking things  Oh man  I think we'll save 
[00:37:30]  Some skits for next week  I have no talent  What do you do?  I'm funny  I know how to do that  I think  That's pretty much it  Okay yeah  Well we got some things  We'll figure it out  You see them writing  On a notebook  As they walk out  Oh boy  It's going to be a tough one  If you would have gotten it  Years ago  When you auditioned  For it  Do you think you'd have  Done well  Or  Like even at that time  Not with knowing  What you know now  In hindsight  But then 
[00:38:00]  Do you think you'd have  Fit in  Or been able to  That competitive  Because I've heard  It's very competitive  With sketches and stuff  I think  I know I'm a workhorse  So I would have literally  Put the work in  Right  To try and get to  You know  Whatever successful point  I could have reached  But you know  The writing and stuff  Would have been great  For me  In doing that  Because I love to write  I love to create  But there's no telling  Where  Where I would have been  You know  As far as  Within the show  The success of the show 
[00:38:30]  Because there's so many people  So right now  Well if they needed  Denzel  They had you  You should have said  Yes to all those questions  That would have been  The greatest  You can answer  Very well  Absolutely  I actually had a record  Come out  But there's a whole  Contract  Impressions  And then name people  That you just  It's impossible to do  It would have been  The greatest  Obscure  Obscure  I do  Rosemary Clooney  How embarrassing  Would that have been man  And they write a big  Denzel sketch  Or a big  I got nothing 
[00:39:00]  I got nothing  Nothing at all  Somewhere around  Friday morning  They knew they were  In deep trouble  Nothing at all  I've been avoiding  I've been avoiding  The rehearsals  Hey Kev  So you want to do  The Denzel thing  I just kind of  Rather wait  To do it on a date  Yeah  I think to really  Give it up  Now  Spontaneous  I want y'all to laugh  And like you've just  Seen it for the first time  Oh they're horrible  Trust me on this  Yeah trust me  Alright you want to  Kev you want to read  The cue cards  Or anything now  Unless everything  Let's just save it  For the day 
[00:39:30]  On a day  It's just a train wreck  I got nothing  Nothing at all  My Denzel is horrible  Oh that would be  Fucking great  Kev Korg  He got nothing on me  What's he doing  Why is he yelling  Asking me to dance  I'm tap dancing  I got tap dance shoes  That would be terrible  I'd watch it  Kevin  What's he doing up there  We're all watching 
[00:40:00]  This Saturday  Yeah this is  This one we're watching  I never watch SNL  No I'll be watching  I think you'll do great  We watched Louie's  Louie was very funny  And I'm sure  You'll be great at it  I can't wait  Fuck the cue cards  Are you worried  About the cue cards  Or no  No  You don't care  I don't care  Because a lot of times  You'll see them look up  But again they're pretty good  At not giving away  That they're  Well too you know  The schedule is so crazy  That you know  Even with the cue cards  And the show being live  And it being last minute decisions  Once you know  What you're doing  The people that are part 
[00:40:30]  Of those things  Are kind of locked into it  So you know  The beats of it  So even if  The cue cards are there  You know  The ballpark  Of where you're supposed to be  So you just stay  Within that vicinity  If it ever looks like  It's oh  I don't remember  Those cue card guys  Could fuck you over though  Man  Yes they could  If they don't like you  They'll just like  You know  Take good time  A little slow turn  A little slow turn  A little slow turn  Who put a question mark  On the teleprompter  They definitely could  But you know 
[00:41:00]  Once again  If you're involved  With what it's supposed to be  You see everything go down  From all the changes  You should pay them off  Before Saturday  Just make sure  They're well fed  Dude I'm really hyped  As if this is a basketball game  Right on man  I'm pumped up  Two other things to talk about too  One is the celebrity all star game  You did  What did you do with Usain Bolt  Oh I beat him  Going up and down the court  I challenged him to a race  But we had to dribble the basketball  Oh with a ball  Okay 
[00:41:30]  So basically  Him dribbling  So you just throw the ball out in front of you  But you gotta keep bouncing the ball  So I smoked him  I set a world record  Come on  Really?  Nah  Well we don't  There's no way to prove it  But there's no way to say  There's no way to say you didn't either  There's no way to say I didn't either  At the end of the day  I beat the world record holder  Which means I probably set a record  He's an amazing athlete  Oh my god  To see him run  Ridiculously fast  Unbelievable  Ridiculously fast  You have to see the guys  That just have so much athletic ability  But it's like  They don't know what to do with  Certain stuff  Like he can't really play basketball  But he can run and jump 
[00:42:00]  Real high  So  For unnecessary reasons  He's jumping above the rim  No no  You're saying  You have to shoot first  You don't jump  You deal with the ball  Just tap the ball on the backboard  And he lands with it  He had no idea about the game  But then he just dunked  Like it was crazy  He's an athlete  Wow  And you know  I mean  Here's the thing  It's a two time MVP  I'm not sure if you're aware of this  I was not aware of that  But I'm happy to hear it  Yeah it's just  Whatever  Who are you the MVP in 
[00:42:30]  Or the celebrity  Whatever game  It's never been done  Whatever  Two times  You're the first one to get two times  Yeah  It's never been done  They didn't think it could be done  No  No no  I think you know  After achieving such an accomplishment  You know  They're like  Well do you want to come back next year  And it's like  Well how much better can it get  I've won twice  The most valuable player  Wow  And I have two trophies  So  Very humble about it  Get a third  I mean if Daniel Day-Lewis can do it  There's no reason you shouldn't have a third  You know I'm thinking about it  You gotta go first  It's just  I mean it's just tough 
[00:43:00]  At the end of the day  It's a fun time  And I think  I'm taking the fun out of it  Right  By continuing to involve myself  And win  By dominating so much  Well it's  It's beyond domination  Yeah  It's beyond domination  Who else played this year  I don't think  I didn't get to watch  John Goodman  Betty White  Who was out there  Come on  Y'all found it  I crossed Betty White over  Oh Betty  I bust your ass 
[00:43:30]  Who played  Trey Songz  Neo  Common  The guy  Jazz Hutchison  From Hunger Games  Terrence  From  The E  Network  They had some people out there  That you would never associate  With athletics  But then  They had some  NBA players  Like the older guys  That retired as well  Like Dikembe Mutombo  Was on my team  It was funny  It was a good time  It was fun  Did he used to live 
[00:44:00]  In our building Mutombo  Did he play for the Knicks  Or the Nets at all  No  Or was it Manute  One of those guys  Lives in our building  Manute Bull  Just black guys  That are tall  No it was you  One of those two  Why should I think  That it's two different people  No it was either  Dikembe or Manute  One of those players  It was one of the tall  It could have been  Manute Bull  You would have known  It was Manute  Did he play for Jersey  Or the Knicks  I don't think so  Then he might have been here  For something else  Because I saw him in the garage  And they said  Yeah that's  What if he was just  Visiting somebody Jim  Well they said that 
[00:44:30]  There's a chance that he could have just been  Naked to stop  I met Manute Bull once  It was unbelievable  How fucking tall this guy was  And how thin at the same time  It was ridiculous  Like the close encounters alien  That came out of the ship  At the end of it  He had the longest  These arms were like  Toothpacks and ridiculously long  It was really long  It passed me  I met Dikembe's son  His son was 13  His son is 6 feet  Wow  Does he have skills 
[00:45:00]  I'll tell you that's  That's because of his dad though  Guy who says  Does he have the skills though  He said his son is good  His son is good  He said his son is good  Listen  I've now thought  My son is at the age  Where he can play  He can play basketball  So you know  Because of  Where I live  I can get my son  Into like the great programs  Basketball programs  So you get there  It's all these NBA players  And their kids  But these guys  Their kids have natural  Talent 
[00:45:30]  So at the age 5  You're looking  And you're like  Wow  And then my son  He's out there  And he's got two  Two left feet on  Like he's not even  Putting his sneakers on  Right  He doesn't bounce the ball  He's just messing up the game  My son is literally  Destroying the fundamentals  Of the game  There's no  You can totally look out there  And see who my son is  Every time  And these other kids  Are really amazing  At the age 5  But a lot of the sons  Don't make it to the NBA  I'm surprised by that  Dude  A lot of them don't 
[00:46:00]  But a lot of them  Go far in the sport  A lot of them  At least get to college  For free  Right  A lot of these guys  Get scholarships  For college  Yeah Rick Barry  Had a bunch of sons  Obviously  I can't think of many  Guys that had their sons  In the NBA  Right now  Do you know any?  Right now  Yes a lot right now  Right now  Del Curry  Del Curry  Okay  Steph Curry  Is in the NBA  And his other son  Is playing for Duke  Who else  Is really really good  That's playing  And my friend  That plays for Syracuse  With Wayne 
[00:46:30]  Left out  Meeks  I forgot Meeks  Last name  I know about a good  Five  Five black guys  Whose kids are in the NBA  Okay  They're doing well  Kyrie Irving's dad  Played too  I believe  Yeah I don't  Look  I'm a sports guy  I don't  Oh yes yes  Kobe Bryant  Kobe Bryant  You forgot about the big one  Jelly Bean  Jelly Bean was in the NBA  Was he?  Yeah but he  He had more success  In Europe  Yeah  He was more  He was overseas  I went to basketball camp  With Kobe  Did you really?  Yes I did  Wow  That's our basketball camp  Kobe played the whole camp  Left handed 
[00:47:00]  Yeah really?  I'm very serious  What year is this?  This is in  This is my junior year  So probably 1996  So he  Oh he was just a young guy  Yeah  That much better than everybody?  Oh my god  He dominated the whole camp  Left handed  Literally  He'd never  He worked on his left hand  The whole hand  Didn't use  Didn't shoot with his right hand  Is that what he was trying to do  Just working on his left?  He was just working on his left hand  He had specific instructions  To work on your left hand  Wow  So he played the whole basketball camp  MVP of the camp  Average 27 points a game 
[00:47:30]  Something like that  He shoot left handed?  Everything  Left hand  Jump shots  Layers  So do you know him now?  Do you remember him?  Oh okay  Yeah we both  We laugh about it  The side basketball camp  Overnight basketball camp  And that's when I thought  I was going to the NBA  Wow shit  That's what?  I've had a basketball dream  That's what?  Muggsy Bogues really really deluded  A lot of fucking small people  Yeah I had a real basketball dream  I wish I could sit up here and say that  I'm not one of those people  That used to be my speech  Kevin you sure you're going to go to the NBA?

I had every small person's biography  I knew everything  Spud Webb  Earl Boykins  I knew them all  How far did you get?  To my senior year in high school  And that letter from community college  Kind of set me straight  Yeah I'm going to probably get recruited by Duke  And you know a bunch of people  Community college sent me a letter  After I figured out I got a 600 on my SAT  Oh shit 
[00:48:30]  Wow  After I did abacadabra for my SAT  ABA  A-B-A-C-A-D-A  A-B-A-C-A-T-A  A-B-A-C-A-T-A  Yeah I was an idiot  Take this SAT test  Me and my friend was there  So we get there  And it was like  Alright it's going to be three hours  So you got to take your time  Three hours  I ain't staying on three hours  It's Saturday  A-B-A-C-A-B-A  A-B-A-C-A  That's classic  It was a great idea  So you get your scores back  And everybody's in your class

[00:49:30]  So far  Far  Far  Far  Far  Continues right now  Welcome back to the worst of 2013  So far  An Opie and Anthony show special  All week long  We're highlighting the very worst  Meaning best  Moments of 2013  Thus far  I'm Sam Roberts  Your host  Anthony and Tijuana  Is where we're going to next  Anthony always is good  For coming up with a story  About his past  But we always think  That we've heard them all 
[00:50:00]  Well  This time he revealed  A story that was yet unknown  About his childhood  Growing up in California  His dad took him on this trip  To Tijuana  Where  Maybe some things happen  That normally kids  Aren't exposed to  When I heard Anthony  Tell this story  It wasn't things  That I could relate to  If you can't relate to them  You'll at least find them  Entertaining  It's Ant and Tijuana  On the worst of 2013  Thus far  O&A's worst of 2013  So far 
[00:50:30]  I love Mexico  I used to  My dad used to  Take me to Tijuana  When we used to live  In San Juan Capistrano  My dad would take me  Down to Tijuana  And  It was interesting  I liked it  Very colorful  Did you buy souvenirs?  No  Because the second  You brought money out  A bunch of kids  Would come running up  And they asked you for it  And then there were horses  Painted like zebras  It was cool though  I bought a big ceramic bowl 
[00:51:00]  And brought it across  The border  The border guy  Wanted to know  What was in it  I was like  It's a piggy bank  I just paid more attention  To my dad  He's hammered  Was he drinking Tijuana?  Oh would he ever  To kill up  Wow  Yeah  Our Tijuana trips  Are legendary  Even though you had to drive?  Oh yeah  He didn't care  Dad drove  Dad would drink and drive  At the same time  Like with a beer  I remember once 
[00:51:30]  He had a beer in one hand  He had his CB mic  In the other  With the cord  And his hand on the wheel  With the CB mic  And then he tried  To make a turn  And wind his hand around  He got literally  Wrapped up  In the CB cord  And the beer  Started spilling  And we're going  Into another lane  And he was hammered  Did you ever take his beer  And dump it out the window  And say this is really  Irresponsible?  Oh yeah  Sure  Sure  Are you kidding?  That would have been death  Where would he drink  In Tijuana? 
[00:52:00]  Like on the street  Or would he bring you  Into like scary bars?  It would be in scary bars  Yeah yeah  There was some scary bars  It's Tijuana  And you were just  The fucking girl  Doing the sex show  Was younger than me  On the stage  How old were you?  Fantastic  How old were you?  I was probably 13  Around there  And you just sit at the bar?  And I would just sit at the bar  Or if they didn't let me  Sit at the bar  I'd sit at a table  Because it was like  A bar restaurant thing  Well you guys would  Drive in right?  Oh yeah  We would drive in  And then  And drive out  Were you worried  About your car getting stolen  Or wasn't he worried 
[00:52:30]  Back then  About getting ripped off  I heard in Tijuana  He'd get ripped off for it  No I don't think he cared  Yeah  Dad didn't really  Think much about it  You're making someone  Very uncomfortable  No this is my experience  In Tijuana  She's very uncomfortable  Oh I know  She's trying to figure out  How the fuck to get out of here  Why?  It was a lot of fun  Yeah  But I remember  It was very dangerous  Like some of the roads  Through San Diego  Yeah  Were you know  The cliffs there and stuff  You know  We'd be driving this truck 
[00:53:00]  And my dad was hammered  And I'm just looking over  Like I used to love  Red lights  I was  Like now I hate it  But I used to drive  With my dad  And then there'd be  A red light  And it was the time  Where I could go  I'd breathe again  I could breathe a little  And I'm like  Fuck  And then like  Green  I would just tense up  And get for the whole  Fucking ride  And I'm like  Leaning my body  Trying to steer the truck  Like  Away from the cliff  Away from an  Like a big cement 
[00:53:30]  Conrock truck  Is rumbling down the road  And he's drifting  Into that lane  Because he's drinking it  He's on his seat  And if I even said  Like dad dad  He'd be like  I see it  God damn it  Don't tell me  I don't  I'm like  Oh god  Oh red light  How far was it  Green  That was terrible  How far ride was it  It was like  What's it from  San Diego  Or from  It was between  LA and San Diego  Capistrano  Like two and a half 
[00:54:00]  Three  Yeah  It was probably  A couple hours  Oh you were taking long drives  Oh fuck it  Dude  We used to go to Lake Elsinore  From Capistrano  And that's over the Ortega Highway  It's like a movie road  Where it's just  On the edge of a cliff  The entire way  And it's all windy  Jesus  And it was  It was horrifying  And you'd get in those lines  To go through customs  Like that  Yeah yeah  That was  Going to Mexico  Yeah  It was  We'd get on the line  To go through customs  They wouldn't give a shit  He'd be happy 
[00:54:30]  He'd be like  How you doing today  And he was the one  That always thought  He was like  The big flirter  When he was drunk  So it's like  Hi little lady  That's what they want to hear  Yeah woman  Is that  I remember once  He was like  You've got a complexion  Like pieces and cream  He said  Like oh god  Dad  Stop it  Would you be embarrassed  Oh yes  But why were you guys  Going down there  It was just a week  Like a Saturday  Thing to do  It's lawless  Go down there 
[00:55:00]  Yeah  What time would you go  It was early in the morning  We would leave  Oh okay  So we'd be there  For the afternoon  And part of the evening  We'd probably head back  About seven  And stuff  So it was a full day  Back when it was dark  Back on the cliff road  Yeah  Oh yeah  The dark night time  Was just a horror show  It was just  I was tense  The whole ride  Clutching your bowl  Oh it was horrible  And by the way  It was a shift truck  Oh no  So he was  And it was on the column 
[00:55:30]  That's right  So he's driving  CB beer  Shifting  Trying to steer  Old blue  The lab  Was in the fucking  Back of the truck  Oh god  Yeah  So you'd have to watch him  Because the poor dog  Is ready to jump out  Of the truck  It was just  It was so much  Anxiety for me  My trip to Tijuana  Was so much anxiety  I love the picture  Of you in the bar  All creepy characters  And smoky  And you're just 
[00:56:00]  Sitting there  Yeah they were like  A little kid  You're sitting there  A little kid  Take it all out  Mariachi band  Would be playing  And I'd just be  Sitting there  And dad's at the bar  Like yeah  Another tequila  Yeah  And I'm just sitting there  And he'd look back  What do you need  Another coke  He'd be like yeah  People's guns  Sticking out of their pockets  Would he talk to people  Or interact with people  Oh yeah yeah  He was very social  Yeah a couple of times  Downstairs from the Franciscan  It's a place called  The Franciscan  And that was in Capistrano 
[00:56:30]  I guess  I guess we were leaving  And we had a bunch  Of his friends and stuff  All drunk and everything  And he was leaving  The parking garage  Which was underneath  The Franciscan  And his truck  Blew a lot of smoke  So he stepped on the gas  And smoke blew out  And a bunch of these tourists  And they hated  If you lived in Capistrano  Because the swallows  Always come back  And they got the mission there  So there were tourists everywhere  And if you lived there  You hated the fucking tourists  So he stepped on the gas  And a bunch of black smoke  Came out of the exhaust  And these tourists were like 
[00:57:00]  Hey fucking asshole  Fuck you  And my father was like  Fuck me  Fuck you  And everyone gets out of the truck  And like now I'm out of the truck  So I'm probably 14  Maybe 13, 14 years old  And I'm standing there  With these big drunk men  And these other tourist guys  And they're like  Yeah you fucking asshole  Fuck you  And I'm like  Oh Jesus Christ  So one of these guys  One of my father's friends  Throws his cigarette pack  At one of his other friends 
[00:57:30]  And goes  Hold these Finney  And he goes to hold them  Because he's going to  Clock this guy in the head  And the tourists  Just pounded him in the face  And one of my father's friends  Is down already  You saw your dad get beat up  No it was one of my father's friends  Got beat up  He got beat up  So then it was on  And at that point  Two guys come running after me  Because I'm the little fucking guy  Oh no  So I'm like  Whoa  I'm hightailing it  You didn't fight  Why would I fight  I didn't even want to be there  This grown up's coming for me  Yeah  It was two of them 
[00:58:00]  Well my dad turned around  And grabbed one of them  And then the other guy  Like I guess he  You know  I ran up the stairs  And that was it  But then I went back downstairs  And the cops were there  And they put everybody against the wall  So we're all just kind of  Leaning against the wall  And I'm looking over  And my father's there  And there's Hal Finney  With his fucking eye all bloody  And I'm like  Oh this was a great night  We were leaving  Hal Finney  Hal Finney  It was Hal Finney  The Cutters  Yeah  The Cutters are in trouble again  Oh it was crazy 
[00:58:30]  Yeah  Yeah  Hal Finney's taco shop  That ain't the name of the phone  Hal Finney Taco Hut  I haven't even thought of Hal Finney in years  I love the fact that Hal Finney got clocked in the eye  Hal Finney was a little bloodied  I don't know  But it sounds like he deserved it a little bit  Yeah  All of them did  Yeah  That's for sure  Like his fighting prep is hold these  I saw my dad brawl a few times  He always did pretty good for himself  Yeah  He never got his ass kicked 
[00:59:00]  I remember when he beat up a Mexican guy  For trying to pick me up at a party  No  Yeah I was hanging out at a party  And it was an outdoor at the stables and stuff  And we were hanging out  And I was drinking some of this home brew that they used to make  And everybody else was  So they were pretty hammered  So I was hanging out  And my dad was talking to his friends  I was probably the same age  Like 13, 14  14, 14  Yeah I was adorable  Very molestable  And there was this Mexican guy  And he was all kind of drunk  And he came over near me  But within earshot of my dad 
[00:59:30]  He goes  Hey how are you doing?  I'm like  Oh good  He's like  Me and you  Why don't we go into the bushes over here  Oh my god  And my dad came flying across the hood of a truck  That we were standing next to  And just grabbed the guy  And started just pounding his face  Wow  And then the rest of the guys were like  Because obviously he was an uncle or cousin of somebody's  He's like  Joey, Joey, Joey  Wait, wait, wait  Hold on  He's like  This motherfucker's  And he's pounding  And I'm there  What was he going to do to me in the bushes? 
[01:00:00]  Hey dad, you cock blocker  I was this close to me in the bushes  Yeah, but dad didn't want him fucking tapping into his supply  I love that all your dad's stories is  He's always very close to the truck  Yes  The truck is right there  How could you drunk drive if you don't have something to drive?  Right  So he's very close to the truck  It's obvious your dad loved you though  Oh, he would not fucking  What the fuck  He wouldn't play  Or he loved fighting  Or hated games 
[01:00:30]  Exactly  Or he just didn't like that guy  There's a lot of options there  Or he was very scared you were going to take the Mexican up on it  Oh, yeah  He didn't want to wait in here if I said yes  Right  Right  Get that off of the pass  Not on my watch  Right  That's not exactly a good  Inspiring tale of fatherly love  You mean he didn't want you to get fucked in the mouth in the shrubs?  Dear old dad  He rolled  I had a lot of fun out there  See, we got a lot of fucking Mexican stories 
[01:01:00]  And the party, by the way, at the stable  It was at Juan Reyes' stable  You might remember Juan Reyes  Oh, I know Juan  His son was Charlie Reyes  Who was shot in the Mojave Desert  When we were all hanging out partying  Right  And had to be driven to Arizona  From the Mojave Desert  He saw his friend get shot  Oh, it was amazing  Yeah  Wow  By his father  Wow  We were all camping out at some mining shack  Out in the Mojave Desert  And the father went to load his gun  He had a .22  And it was an old style one  Where you had to have it half cocked  To spin the cylinder  So he lifted it up  Before he put the hammer down 
[01:01:30]  On an empty cylinder  It was a live cylinder  And the bullet went off  Shot his 10-year-old son Charlie  Right through the shoulder  It went right in  Like  Over his heart  And then out the back  Jesus  And I was looking at Charlie  Right at the time  And he just went  Ah  And it looked like  It looked like a water fountain of blood  Pumped out  And he just went down his knees  And then down his face  Oh my god  And I'm like  Holy fuck  I just saw someone get shot  Wow  This is crazy  And then they all packed him  Into a pickup truck  And we were in between 
[01:02:00]  We were in between Barstow  Jeez  And Needles, Arizona  Oh man  Somewhere  And like 50 miles off the main road  Oh my god  We had doom buggies  And guns  And fucking whiskey  It was crazy  Desert  See, guns are bad, Ant  See?  No, they were great  We used to take  We used to  We were like  Like again  14 years old  And we would take these doom buggies out  And have two people in the back  One driving  And one in the passenger seat  All with rifles  And we're just shooting anything  Like Mad Max  From moving doom buggies  Yeah, it was like fucking 
[01:02:30]  Mad Max  The children's version  We'd shoot  Any poor living thing  That came across us  Was dead  Jesus  I think I shot a lizard  I never thought the taco show  Would turn into this  Oh, this is all about  You know  Southern California  And me hanging out  With the Mexican people  Yeah, it's where tacos come from  Arizona  It was the Old Woman Mountains  And it was a big  Old silver and turquoise mine  With a little mining shack  And we used to just camp there  It was great  That sounds awesome  You guys want to go to Disneyland  Like everybody else? 
[01:03:00]  Disneyland?  You can't drink in the Magic Kingdom  Are you crazy?  You can't let your friend Charlie get shot  Right  I'm going to see Charlie get shot  In the Magic Kingdom  It's a small world  Fuck that  What a disaster of a childhood  Oh, it was fantastical  It sounds fun  It was magical  Really  When I think about it  It really sounds great  I finally came to my senses  And was like  I got to go back home  To my mom in New York  Because this is going really poorly  Dad's fun  But this is wrong  It was  It was like fun 
[01:03:30]  But even I  At that young age  Realized  Wow  I'm really headed down  A weird road here  I just pictured me driving the pickup truck  With a fucking Budweiser between my legs  That CB in my hand  With my little boy  Fucking tensed up  With anxiety and palpitations  Or some little boy  More awkward moments  Can you turn your head and cough?  Epic fails  That was a shitty joke that barbed  And fouled mouth rant  Why don't you shut the fuck up?

[01:15:00]  That was later  And that was the first  White reggae artist  Right  It wasn't really  Was it really hip hop though  You consider that  Really hip hop  That was mostly reggae though  Yeah it was kind of  A reggae twist  It was like reggae  Hip hop thing  Definitely reggae  Almost reggaeton  It was good though  It was good  I still don't understand  One damn word he said  No  But I still hum him  Informa  Right  So now when you go to somebody's  When you go to somebody's house  Do they immediately like recognize you  And they're like  Oh damn man 
[01:15:30]  That's ice  Yeah of course  Yeah yeah  Hey I shake a hand  Make a friend man  It doesn't bother me  And then they're like  God damn  Now he's all informed about this  But were you always into the housing thing  No man  I just stumbled upon it  I was  When I was young  I did Ice Ice Baby  We were 16 man  Wow  You were 16 when I came out  16  16  16 million records  Remember  A little different  No no  It was  Dun Dun Dun Dun Dun Dun Dun Dun  Instead of  Dun Dun Dun Dun Dun Dun Dun  It changed here in the middle of the lawsuit  Yeah  That's charming 
[01:16:00]  It changed in the middle of the lawsuit  We're not gonna lie to you man  We've had fun with that clip over the years  Yeah bro  You can't explain that  And I was like  What am I doing here  That is a great clip, man.  No, no, that one goes dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun.  That one goes dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun.  It's a little bit extra dun.  The one when I went up.  Dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun.  It's hilarious.  I forgot about this shit.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  People weren't sampling as much back then, I guess, huh?  Well, it was around.  It's just nobody really sold any records. 
[01:16:30]  You know what I'm saying?  So they left you alone.  And it was weird that it was looked at like, oh, what's he doing?  Now, of course you sample shit.  But back then, it was like, oh, you're ripping off that song.  It's like, no, man.  I remember after my record was out, I mean, there was like no real sample clearances.  There was no organization, no company, nothing.  Now there's like right across the street here, Avenue of America.  There's a huge building, sample clearances, you know?  Really?  And I mean, sampling was done way before I came along.  Well, that's my question.  I want a history lesson.  What was the first sample that everyone knows?  First samples?  Does anyone know? 
[01:17:00]  EPMD, maybe?  I think maybe Stetsasonic might have sampled some stuff, but it was really covered up.  But what songs did they sampled?  There had to be the first one.  It was usually probably Roger Troutman or Zap or something like in that era, right?  I mean, that's a lot.  A lot of rock dudes got sampled and they woke up like, uh-oh.  Niggas are making money.  We got to get that.  That's what happened, you know?  We got to get that.  But until they made, like there was some, you know, in the hip-hop community, you know,  there was a lot of successful records, but they didn't sell a lot.  So the team of lawyers, they didn't really, you know, go after it until it really sold. 
[01:17:30]  The laws were probably created after he came out.  Yeah, it's like, wait, how much money?  How many records did he sell?  Yeah, yeah.  What?  There's money there.  He's using, wait, sounds like Queen to me.  You sold like 15 million, though, of one record, though.  You know, to date, 160 million.  God damn it.  You know, Eye Size Baby, to the extreme, sold almost 3 million copies just last year alone.  I mean, it helps with the TV show and being on the Adam Sandler movie and all these different things.  You get a taste of that? 
[01:18:00]  A good taste?  I bought all my publishing back, man.  So you get a nice taste.  Wow, nice.  That's how I'm able to do what I do in real estate, you know?  One song.  I don't know if you want to answer this.  Two songs.  You know, I got a song that's catching that big time.  Which one?  The Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles.  Oh, okay.  Right.  The Ninja Rat.  It's so big right now, I can't even explain it to you.  Everybody knows Eye Size Baby, but I'm telling you, the generation that's out there right  now running this world grew up to the Turtles, man.  Yep.  Right.  And they are into it.  I mean, it is huge. 
[01:18:30]  They got signs.  They come dressed to my concerts like Ninja Turtles.  They jump on stage.  What?  Oh, yeah, man.  How much has the Eye Size Baby made you over the years?  Do you ever say?  I'm good.  Lots.  I'm good.  I'm financially good.  Ridiculous number?  Ridiculous.  Yeah, I wouldn't doubt it.  That one's strong.  You know, it's not about money, man.  It's all about family and friends.  I can't tell you.  Listen, you ain't born with it, you're not going to buy with it.  Well, that's the thing, is that if you got no family and friends to share it with, you  would trade it for the family and friends.  No, you just stay home and watch TV and you're on movie theater and screeners and you drink 
[01:19:00]  a lot.  Oh, shit, that's me.  Wait a minute.  Oh, wait.  Oh, God.  And who wants to be like that?  Exactly.  Wow.  Man, one.  You never met David Bowie, though?  You never interacted?  Yeah, man.  Listen, after the lawsuit, the lawsuit worked out in my favor.  Because I ended up buying their song.  Wow.  It was $4 million.  What the fuck?  And it was one of the best investments.  I didn't know it at the time.  But you own Under Pressure now? 
[01:19:30]  Yeah.  Get the fuck out of it.  It was cheaper than, well, it was cheaper than, you know.  What?  Wait, so you own Under Pressure.  How did that work out?  That's great.  Well, the same way Michael Jackson bought the Beatles.  How did that work out?  You know, people can buy publishing.  Most people don't buy the publishing because after seven years, they'll take the advance towards  their publishing for another seven years.  And then you have the option to buy it right then and there.  All right.  I'll give you the four mil for Under Pressure.  Take it.  And it was a great investment.  That is brilliant.  It was better than keep paying the, you know. 
[01:20:00]  Because I've seen that show up in commercials and stuff.  Everywhere.  Yeah.  And you get that every time now.  Yeah.  I am.  So it doesn't matter.  It's all cha-ching, cha-ching now.  It's it.  It's changed.  How does that part go?  Cha-ching, cha-ching, cha-ching, cha-ching, cha-ching, cha-ching, cha-ching, cha-ching.  That's what it sounds like now, motherfuckers.  I love it.  Holy Jesus.  I know.  Brilliant.  I know while you're sleeping, like, the ghost of, like, the gay ghost of Queen is, like,  looking at you, like, motherfucker. 
[01:20:30]  I know Queen is watching you right now.  They have plenty of songs of their own to hang on to.  Wow.  Who made that?  You haven't met Queen.  The gay ghost.  Why'd they have to be the gay ghost?  I guess Freddie Mercury.  Yeah, of course.  You know, African-Americans aren't very tolerant of gay lifestyle.  We all know that.  Why is that?  They have to be down on the DL.  No, we're cool now.  I got a gay hat on today.  Oh, yeah.  You know, it's pretty gay.  It's super gay.  I'll be gay warm today.  And even Obama came out and said, you know, no, he didn't come out. 
[01:21:00]  What did he come out and say?  He didn't come out.  Drum roll, please.  Supporting gay rights and stuff.  Sure, man.  But you got the Biggie shirt on.  That's cool.  You know, I keep represented.  It's like gangster and gay.  GG, you know what I'm saying?  Double G'd out, man.  That's dope.  It's like ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding.  So you now officially own that.  That's great.  And I'm not embarrassed to say I copied his dance moves.  I think every black kid copied his dance moves.  You know that, right?  You know, every black kid copied that whole. 
[01:21:30]  You still remember him?  What?  The back and forth.  Oh, that was like, yeah, yeah.  That shit was fucking righteous.  That was so hard right there.  What was O&A doing when this song was out?  What were y'all doing?  What year is that now?  91.  No, I'm trying to remember.  I'm not even being a dick.  91.  Wow.  91 already.  Doing drugs and bad-mouthing your country.  I was doing radio in, where the fuck?  Buffalo, I guess.  I was working construction on Long Island.  I didn't play your record.  I was at a rock station. 
[01:22:00]  You guys were, I remember, and then you came to New York shortly after.  Wow.  And then I came in there, and then I think you had some issues, legal issues yourself.  Yeah, there were a couple things.  That happens.  I remember some stuff, too.  It happens, you know.  Yeah, we got fucking.  Made us bigger.  That's it, though.  The lawyers told us, fucking dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun.  Your ass out the fucking door.  That's it.  You ain't buying shit.  Dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun.  Hit your ass on the way out.  Yeah, you ain't buying shit.  I love it.  Yeah, you ain't buying your way out of this loop. 
[01:22:30]  You guys are too much, man.  I love it.  What a friggin' different lifestyle, man.  Yeah, you figured it out.  I don't know, man.  That's fantastic.  Day by day.  Day by day.  You're loving doing a TV show?  Yesterday's history, tomorrow's a mystery, man.  Just take it day by day.  Love life.  I got a meme out of that.  That's it, brother?  Jesus Christ.  Don't panic.  Tomorrow hasn't happened yet.  What else about the show?  You got Lazy Rivers, and you got this smartphone stuff.  Oh, I got a panoramic gaming room with a 200-inch screen that comes all the way. 
[01:23:00]  It wraps around you.  Whoa.  Okay?  What?  And you sit on this big vibrating chair.  You put on the 3D glasses, and it's a gaming room.  That's, like, totally immersed.  I mean, it really comes to life.  It's surround sound, and it's got subwoofers, but it's got some kind of, like, vibrating  thing underneath the chair that'll actually, if you hit something, it'll kick you in the  ass.  Yeah.  It'll thump you, man.  I like that whole wraparound.  And 3D.  Jeez, that's got to look great.  It's like you're in it.  I built the world's first IMAX home theater.  IMAX at home?  At home. 
[01:23:30]  Look at me.  I'm a piece of shit with a regular fucking...  What is that, a couple G's?  Yeah.  Couple of two, huh?  Yeah.  Couple of two.  Oh, my God.  Perhaps more than that.  They're saying we've got to wrap up, but we've got to, like...  Oh, man, you're busy today, huh?  Yeah.  All over the place.  Getting everybody to tune in for Sunday, man.  That's great.  You know what?  You and the Who Kid for the Instagram.  A lot of...  You and the Who Kid.  Yeah, that's nice.  That's a good one.  Hold on.  I'm fucking this shit up.  A lot of guys...  All right, hold on.  Here we go.  Finally.  One, two, three.  You know, a lot of guys were arrested on their laurels there. 
[01:24:00]  I don't know what's going on.  You know, just raking in that money and fucking...  But you found a good niche for yourself, and you're doing all right.  Hey.  I like that.  You got to find a passion and run with them.  I like seeing these true Hollywood stories where they end up tragic, you know?  Yeah, well, they're entertaining as well.  I mean, we all loved...  Who didn't love...  I'm sure you guys had a fun day with it, with Britney Spears shaving her head and going crazy.  Oh, yeah.  Come on.  You know, the thing is that, like, you know, I did...  I had a transitional period, like I said.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  A weekend that lasted a few years.  But, you know, you got to figure out your purpose in life and where you belong in. 
[01:24:30]  And I can't wait to watch what Bieber goes through, you know?  Yeah, right.  It's going to be some shit.  It's going to be some shit.  Why is that?  Hopefully it gets...  Is it crazy?  Because you're used to living this huge artificial life, being on stage in front of all these  people all the time, every night.  And then when it stops, you got to get back into reality.  Man.  And that's the part where everybody loves to tune in and watch.  It's very entertaining, you know?  That's the entertaining part.  Train Rick.  Let's watch him fall off the fucking pedestal.  Horrible for the person living it.  Great for the people watching.  Yeah, yeah.  We never got that big, so we're good. 
[01:25:00]  Exactly.  Exactly.  We almost were there.  We were almost there a few times.  Almost made it.  Yeah, we threw ourselves off the pedestal before anyone put us there.  Yeah, yeah.  We're like, fuck this.  Yeah.  Holy shit, man.  Hey, fuck it.  What are you?  Ice?  You just go buy ice, right?  Rob.  My mom called me Rob.  Yeah, Rob.  I respond either way.  I like that.  It's pretty cold outside, but I'll take ice.  Yeah, all right.  I thought he'd be icy.  Ice.  I got my jewelry on.  Look, I want all my ice today.  Oh, man.  I got an ice ring on my dick. 
[01:25:30]  I had no intention of watching your TV show.  I'm going to watch that.  I had no intention, but now I'm going to check it out.  The keyboard is head, right?  There you go.  So now we've inspired you.  I'm just being honest with you.  Who cares?  We'll do an interview with him.  We'll have fun.  We'll remember him from N.E.W., but I'm going to watch the show.  It gives you great ideas for stuff you want to do to your house, too, man.  It's the DIY Network.  It's called the Vanilla Ice Project.  Yep.  Come back and see us, man.  I sure will, man.  I will.  Thanks for having me on the show, guys.  Great to see you.  The worst is yet to come.  This is so fucked up, man.  This is O&A's worst of 2013 so far on the O.P. and Anthony channel. 
[01:26:00]  Yeah, this is O.P. and Anthony's worst of 2013 so far.  Welcome back to the worst of 2013.  So far, highlighting the great O.P. and Anthony moments that have happened this year.  I mean, since January.  2013 has been a big year, big enough that we had to celebrate with a week-long special  only seven months into the year.  I'm Sam Roberts.  I'll be your host all week long. 
[01:26:30]  Let's move on to the Patrice O'Neill Tribute Show.  This year, we were able, well, Bill Burr, really, was able to put together an amazing  tribute show to, to me, maybe the greatest comedian of our time, the late, great Patrice  O'Neill.  And we had a whole bunch of the comedians come by the day after the event to talk about  everything that had happened and their memories of Patrice.  You're talking about Bill Burr, Colin Quinn, Bobby Kelly, Dave Attell.  You're not going to find a show like this anywhere else but right here on the O.P. 
[01:27:00]  and Anthony show's worst of 2013 so far.  This is O.N.A.'s worst of 2013 so far on the O.P.  and Anthony channel.  We got Bill Burr in studio and Colin Quinn in studio.  And they just entertained the hell out of us for the last ten minutes.  What else you have in the studio?  The other celebrity, Adam Derwitz.  Sam in the corner.  Of course, the big Patrice O'Neill benefit today.  That's why Bill Burr is in town. 
[01:27:30]  That's why Colin Quinn's in studio.  It's going to be a great night.  No tickets available, obviously, right?  I don't think so.  No, there's a few that are going to be released.  It's one of those things where they release them last minute?  We had to save some for family and friends and that type of stuff.  And those people didn't show up, so now they release comps.  Patrice insulted all of them, so they were like, I don't want to come to it.  So there's going to be very few, but they're going to be released.  Do they go to the box office at the New York City Center?  You know, I have that information somewhere in my phone here. 
[01:28:00]  I was supposed to have all of that.  They'll figure it out.  Maureen's going to kill me.  I don't like the fact that Bill Burr actually put a whole thing together that kind of worked  at the City Center.  You know what?  I love it, and I love that it bugs Colin.  Yeah.  I love that he probably lays at night staring at his awful ceiling.  But everything bugs Colin.  I don't even know what doesn't.  It needs to be painted for 10 years.  What's the thing about Colin?  Shaving cream.  Get my fucking Arthur's father.  No, I mean, why is it even Ellie's?  Oh, no.  It doesn't matter because I literally kept this on today because I know my facial hair really 
[01:28:30]  bugs Norton.  You'll have my permission to marry him.  What doesn't bug you?  What doesn't bug you, Colin?  Pretty much everything bugs you.  Joy.  Joy bugs Colin.  What doesn't bug me?  Racial equality.  People getting along.  That is nice.  The new society we live in.  That kind of thing I enjoy.  That first day of spring.  Oh, good one, Bill.  Oh, that is good. 
[01:29:00]  Colin's had a lot of observations just sitting here.  Yeah.  Bill's talking about a business model.  You went after him.  We're bitching about Live Reads.  You're going after us.  I was literally just answering a question.  I feel like why would that be unusual from what happens on the show every day?  That's true.  Isn't it all we do is go after whoever's talking?  Tell us how you really feel.  That's a good one.  Who's emceeing, Voss?  Yes.  Oh.  Nice.  Did that fucking weasel get himself the host job?  I'm telling you, I'm a good host.  I'm telling you. 
[01:29:30]  Keep it moving.  Keep it moving.  I like the fact that you see Bill's response.  The kid teaching 20 years of acting school.  Like, who's hosting, Voss?  He goes, yes.  Because I already know guys are going to be bitching about the lineup.  Dad, why am I going here?  Fucking blah, blah, blah.  That's why I haven't told anybody the lineup.  I'm not dealing with this.  Tell us the lineup now.  Talk to Maureen.  Oh, the lineup.  Tell us the lineup now.  Colin, you are going first and last.  Whoa. 
[01:30:00]  Look at you.  Those are the best marks.  Those are the best marks.  I hope you don't.  I have to get up very early, so I can't go.  Oh, well.  Listen, I got to get out of here.  I don't know about you guys.  I got to get out of here.  I do get up at 5.  Sorry.  I hope that's considered.  I just figured I'd pass the hat around.  We'll do a little potluck thing.  You know, just be a bonding moment.  Be a bonding moment.  Oh, my God.  Across draws.  Patrice benefits.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Bill won't give us the lineup. 
[01:30:30]  He says we're going to do it.  Bill won't give us the lineup.  We're going to tag team it.  That's what we're going to do.  Tag team.  Just boom, boom, boom, boom, boom.  All the way down.  That dude voices host it.  We're going to start.  No.  Maybe he is.  I can't remember.  Oh.  I'll speak to Maureen.  You speak to Maureen.  That's the way to go.  You better talk to her.  Maureen put it.  See, Bill put it together.  But then he needed Maureen to bring it home.  Yeah.  Comedians can't do this kind of stuff on our own.  He just can't stand it.  He just can't stand that I did something good.  I don't know what it is.  Yeah.  What's wrong with you, Kyle?  My heart was in the right place.  I knew there was things that I couldn't handle. 
[01:31:00]  I delegated power.  No.  I did a great thing.  I just don't understand what you have against benefits.  I have nothing against benefits.  I do hate benefits.  How about friends with benefits?  What?  Oh.  Don't get dirty.  Come on.  He has a problem with this bill?  Kyle?  Nobody wants to get an email from me.  Why?  You're doing a good thing.  You're doing a good thing.  I enjoy a good Bill Burr email.  They're fun.  Yeah.  They're nice.  Like one of my pals say.  You know how long it took me to construct each email trying to figure out what the other 
[01:31:30]  nine comics, how they were going to attack me?  Really?  That's a lot of stress.  Colin was probably the most consistent.  Right.  Keith was probably the meanest.  What?  They just write you back?  All sorts of crap?  All right.  Stupid.  Even for a benefit.  Even for a really nice thing.  It just never ends with you guys.  Yeah.  And then the planning of it.  You couldn't call anybody.  The second you bring it up.  Yeah.  Listen to what we're going.  Dude. 
[01:32:00]  This is what you should do.  Dude.  You should start with a cake.  And then we'll have a slideshow.  I got a buddy of mine.  He's got a wireless cupcake store.  And then I got to fucking deal with all that.  So I tried to keep each email as informative and with as little shit as possible.  Right.  And then this asshole, Colin, would be like, even in your emails, you're ice cold and a non-feeling  human being, he just started really breaking me down psychologically.  That's what I've been dealing with.  What a nightmare. 
[01:32:30]  Oh, I have a whole new fond of respect for people who do this shit.  Yeah.  Well, the important thing about tonight's benefit, Bill did do a great job.  And it's not one of those benefits where there's too many people on the show or anything  like that.  Oh, my God.  He just can't do it.  I love Colin.  This guy cannot do it.  Oh, yeah.  Who's on it?  It's obviously Keith, Colin.  Oh, yeah.  We want to know he's going first and he's going last.  And I'm going to make him read announcements. 
[01:33:00]  We're trying to fill in the lineup.  We got most of them, I think.  Yeah.  Bill, Colin.  Keith, Rich.  Rich, me.  Bobby, Will Silvins.  Who are we missing?  Ian Edwards.  Marita Franklin.  Will Silvins.  Oh, Will's making it.  Okay, good.  Rich Voss.  I think that was everybody.  That's a lot.  Ricky V.  I think you should make Voss MC.  You know what?  We will take that into consideration.  I'll speak to Maureen.  I've got her email.  Absolutely.  There's another thing, too. 
[01:33:30]  Trying to get photos from these jackasses.  We're such morons.  We all knew each other 20 years.  Yeah.  You get some blurry photo from like fucking 1998 with half a face on it.  Sorry, dude.  This is all I got.  Trying to put this thing.  I will never fucking do something like this again.  Fucking.  But it makes Colin happy.  It is so true.  It doesn't make me true.  Keith Robinson sent a photo in.  It looked like somebody had poured milk on it like fucking 20 years ago.  And I just wrote back.  I'm like, really?  Ah, you know, player. 
[01:34:00]  Player.  I don't know.  Player.  That's all I got.  I don't know.  Who was the most responsible with the pics?  Huh?  Did I not get you photos immediately?  Jim Norton.  Immediately.  Superstar, right?  Superstar Jim Norton.  I have not said one negative thing about Jim.  Bob Kelly got some really good pictures of us from Brazil.  He has a bunch that he showed.  Yeah, man.  He fucking sent me a couple recently.  You got to do a benefit every year just to make Colin happy.  Because it seems to make him very happy.  I'd love to do it.  I'll do it every year, year and a half.  And it'll give him yet another reason to trash me. 
[01:34:30]  It'll be like your sort of second Christmas every week.  Why are you trashing Bill, Colin?  Look, I wouldn't be able to do that.  I couldn't believe he was doing it.  False modesty.  I couldn't believe he was getting emails from Bill going, okay, guys, this is really happening.  We're doing it this way.  I was kind of impressed.  But it was still funny because I knew what he was dealing with.  Because I knew he was dealing with me.  I knew everybody else was there.  So it wasn't really kind of a hassle.  We know that, stupid.  I'm sorry.  I said something funny and it annoys you.  It wasn't funny.  It was just pompous and righteous.  It is annoying. 
[01:35:00]  Colin hates me.  Why do you hate Bill?  I love Bill Burr.  Bill Burr has hated me since day one.  Really?  The man.  It's not true.  I'm fucking around.  Look how he loves that.  He's like, really?  I want to get into it.  Hitting people against each other, you lazy motherfucker.  What's wrong with that?  You lazy motherfucker.  He's not as lazy.  He just, let's let these guys argue.  That'll take ten minutes up.  You know what?  Say it, point guard.  Come up with another subject.  There's something wrong with that.  How about the Jews?  Oh, shit.  Oh, tippy. 
[01:35:30]  You see his eyes light up?  That's good stuff.  His eyes light up.  Bill's in a bad mood.  Are you in a bad mood?  He's trying to turn it around on me.  I'm in a great mood.  How can we tell?  I'm in a great mood.  How can we tell?  I'm in a great mood.  He's annoyed.  I caught him.  I'm not annoyed.  I can tell.  You're holding your wrist.  You look annoyed.  Fucking killing it.  Setting the pace for everybody.  Everyone else.  It was a monster show. 
[01:36:00]  It really was.  It reminded me of the virus shows without all the hoora and the alcoholism.  And the meat.  I tried to bring that.  I tried to bring that part of it.  Somebody said backstage that was the first time you guys all did it since the virus, really.  Yeah, it's the first time we've all been together since then, yeah.  And it was kind of sad at one point.  I was like, because I remember those shows.  And I remember me and Patrice always had the same locker room.  You guys always put us together.  Oh, yeah?  For some reason. 
[01:36:30]  And, you know, yapping to him.  And then, Voss, I'm anxious.  I think it's going to be good.  Yeah.  I didn't take my anxiety medicine.  It was funny.  Eight o'clock.  But he kept saying how he was suffering from anxiety.  And then he's telling me and Ant to give him a really nice intro.  You know?  And then he proceeds to trash us.  I'm like, really?  Because it's Voss.  I know, but he wanted desperately the real nice intro.  Oh, you gave him the line?  I gave him the line.  What was it?  The lesbian and the...  The lesbo and the doomsday prepper. 
[01:37:00]  That was pretty goddamn funny.  It was funny.  Why would you give that to Voss, you bastard?  Yeah, what are you going to do?  What are you going to do?  It was a great night, though.  You guys coming out.  Oh, it was fucking amazing.  And everything went flawless.  Everybody kind of stuck to their time.  And the only thing sucked about going up front is that they were really on me.  Fucking, you know, do your time.  I was panicking.  I was just panicking.  I was just watching the...  Like, fucking, all right.  I got to fuck.  Because what happens is when you get to your time, it switches, turns red. 
[01:37:30]  We were talking about this.  We were talking about that.  That's the...  I have been an asshole for two and a half minutes.  Yeah, it's just red and it's going, one, dickhead.  Two, fuck off.  Three, get off, you piece of shit.  Five, Patrice is dead and you're fucking his memory.  But, uh...  It was great.  Yeah, it was a great night.  And everybody killed, too.  It always sucks when...  No one had a bad set.  Not one person had a bad set.  I really was hoping Keith Robinson would take a hot one just to teach him a lesson. 
[01:38:00]  Damn it.  God damn it.  He killed it.  He did.  I haven't seen Ian Edwards in so long.  He was really funny.  And then, you know, I've seen Bill and Bobby a million times.  But Ian, I don't see anymore because he lives out in L.A.  And we used to work together all the time at the Boston Comedy Club.  He used to have dreads.  He's bald now.  Did you know Ian before?  Yeah, I knew him from back in the day.  One of the best Pete Correale stories ever with Ian Edwards.  Yeah.  What?  He was on stage talking about his dowry.  How, like, you know, African couples have a dowry.  And they were like, yeah, you have to give them cattle. 
[01:38:30]  And Pete Correale went, cattle?  It just came out and he heard him, but he thought it was an audience member at the old Boston.  And he went, yeah, motherfucker.  What do you think they used before they had money?  And Pete went, you.  That's fucking good.  Yeah, it was a great show, man.  Everybody killed it.  It was.  What's up with the posters that everyone's talking about?  Oh, yeah, they sold great, first of all. 
[01:39:00]  Can you guys print more or no?  No, you print.  Limit and run because it's a work of art.  It's not just a poster we went to Staples or Kinko's and had.  We had the artist, Tyler Stout, donated the image.  He made the image.  He's a fan of Patrice.  He came up with two versions.  And then they, you know, they hand silkscreen each one.  And then he signs them and he numbers them.  So there's only 300 of the purple.  There was 100 of the gold.  We sold a lot of the gold.  We sold a lot of them last night.  But we also signed five each. 
[01:39:30]  So there's five gold, five purple that are going to be coming out this week.  On an auction that are signed by everybody who did the show.  And then the rest of them are going online on the same page.  So at Danny J. Ross.  And me and Billy and Norton, you guys will be tweeting out when they go online.  Dot com.  The website.  All that dot com.  Dot com.  W-W-W.  No, what was it?  Danny J. Ross dot com.  Can you try that, Sam?  Danny J. Ross.  At Danny J. Ross.  Okay. 
[01:40:00]  I like them both.  Oh, you were doing it as a website, I thought.  Now I'm confused.  What's going on, Sam?  Just go to Patrice O'Neill dot big cartel dot com.  Yeah.  Oh, where the fuck are Big Cartel?  All right, we'll put that on the Facebook page.  Opie and Anthony on Facebook will have the same phone.  Right now it says they're sold out, but I think that just because Danny hasn't got the money  left yet.  We have some purple and some gold left, and then the five and five signed by all of us,  so they'll be coming out.  So get them.  We autographed them.  Oh, I see.  Fucking Voss last night.  I'm like, everybody walks in. 
[01:40:30]  I go, just don't sign on the art and make it small.  Oh, boy.  Boom, boom, boom.  He comes in, first one, right over the fucking image.  No.  Right on the rocket.  I'm like, I said don't sign on the fucking art.  What a dope.  On the rocket?  Yeah, right on the edge of the rocket.  At least it wasn't on Patrice.  I had to fucking yell at him every signature just to make him shake so he'd sign it correctly.  Dolt.  What a dope.  That one's worth more money now.  Voss's name on the rocket.  It's the exact opposite of what he's on in show business. 
[01:41:00]  He's signing an anchor.  Ah, shit.  Yeah, those images were really fucking well made, man.  I liked them a lot.  It's real artwork.  Yeah.  Absolutely.  Yes, indeedy.  David Tell, how are you, sir?  Good, man.  How's it going, guys?  Good seeing you last night.  Yes.  The big, amazing benefit.  That was great.  Very cool.  You know, I've done a lot of these, and I have to tell you, that was the biggest, best produced,  just all around great benefit I've ever seen. 
[01:41:30]  It really was, man.  All the fans of Patrice and, of course, all the comics.  That was just an amazing turnout.  Everyone did very well.  There wasn't one bomb.  Nope.  I was a little sappy, but I think it was all pretty straight up.  And it was a long show, too.  It didn't feel like a long show.  Except for Will's poem.  Black star, black star.  Black star, black star, black star.  Black star, black star, black star, black star.  Black star, where are you?  Black star?  The best part was when his iPhone turned off.  Yeah. 
[01:42:00]  Yeah.  That was Patrice.  Did you see that?  I was upstairs.  It fucks up the whole pacing.  If you're going to do a poem, you can't have your iPhone turn off in the middle of it  and go to the audience, wait, I've got to turn my phone back on or reset it or whatever  the fuck he said.  He didn't write it down.  He didn't write black star down.  I want to hear the poem again.  Black star, black star.  Oh, God.  I was walking.  I wasn't even in the show.  I was upstairs, and I just walked by a speaker and heard, black star, black star.  I was like, what the fuck?  Stop me in my tracks.  What the fuck is he doing?  Well, at the end of his set, and he had a great set, too, he decided he needed to read 
[01:42:30]  something for Patrice that he wrote.  Shout out.  A little shout out.  It was.  Was Patrice the black star?  Mm-hmm.  Yeah.  Okay.  All right.  We got that much.  Because it got a little confusing there.  Now, I wonder if we could get Will in to do that as those two guys go down on each other.  Oh, wow.  There you go.  If we had a tsunami of awkward, and then gotten rid of all the gay, you know.  Let's get Will on the phone and do Black Star.  Go ahead.  Black Star, black star. 
[01:43:00]  Oh, God.  Maybe not.  If anyone could get a hold of Will, tell him to call it.  There's no, nobody can, poetry sucks.  It does.  We hate poetry.  It stinks.  They were doing a, Liz at the Comedy Cellar, who's the best, they were doing a farewell  party.  She's like the assistant manager there, or the manager, whatever.  And some girl from the underground got up and read a poem.  Ooh, fucking poetry.  Poetry stinks.  This is what Keith, she did it without a microphone, and she got a laugh on one of the first lines,  and then Keith made her say it again, because he got a microphone, and he goes, do it again. 
[01:43:30]  He made her do the first over.  So it was like, tell him the same joke twice in front of the same audience.  Did he get another laugh?  She got nothing.  Oh.  Did he get another laugh?  And then it, yeah, and then it went downhill from there.  I think Keith promised.  Say it again.  Say it again.  She was like, no, no, no, say it again.  You didn't like it.  Nothing.  What was the joke?  Oh, I forget.  It was just rhymed.  It was a quirky rhyme, and it was, um, it was terrible.  It was, it just went downhill.  I like my poems to rhyme, though.  I do, too.  You need them to rhyme.  You need them to rhyme, at least. 
[01:44:00]  Don't rhyme, it ain't a poem.  Let's at least rhyme those poems.  What do you want from me?  Oh, yeah, sir, yeah, it gets worse.  This is hilariously bad.  More of Opie and Anthony's worst of 2013.  So far, so far, coming up.  Must hear moments for the past six months.  Opie and Anthony's worst of 2013.  So far, continues.  Yeah, you heard right.  Opie and Anthony are on vacation.  Instead, you're left with me, Sam Roberts.  But I'm not going to make you listen to my voice the whole time.  No, no, I wouldn't do that to you. 
[01:44:30]  Instead, I will present to you the worst of 2013 so far,  giving you all the best moments from the Opie and Anthony show  that have happened this year thus far.  It's like seven months' worth of best of.  But there's so much great stuff going on that we needed a week to do it in.  And one of the great things about being on the Opie and Anthony show  is all the cool people that are friends of the show.  One of these guys is Penn Jillette.  Penn Jillette has never had a bad appearance on the Opie and Anthony show.  And he's been on many, many times. 
[01:45:00]  He's always good.  He's always interesting.  He stopped by, you know, he's going to talk about bullshit,  to talk about his new ice cream flavor,  but more importantly, to talk about Celebrity Apprentice.  Of course, Penn was in the finals of this year's Celebrity Apprentice,  and he came by to try to push his ice cream  and get people to help him win this thing.  Listen to Penn Jillette on the worst of 2013 so far.  The worst of 2013 so far.  The Opie and Anthony show. 
[01:45:30]  Penn Jillette outside the studio.  And Roland just handed us ice cream.  Yeah, I normally wouldn't eat ice cream this early in the morning,  but I'm going to have a couple of bites.  Hi, Penn.  How you doing, my friend?  Good to see some friendly things.  Absolutely.  What's up, Penn?  I'm going to try out some of this ice cream here.  You better.  The ice cream looks all right, brother.  It's really good.  It's really good.  Look at the packaging.  My God.  Oh, my God.  Will this actually be in stores?  What do you mean, will it be?  It's in stores now.  Oh, sorry.  And, you know, we've already bought several cartons.  That's what we're supposed to say. 
[01:46:00]  This is so creamy and delicious.  It's creamy and good, and it's mine.  Oh, look at the chocolate in here.  Oh, my God.  I'll have a couple of bites.  I've been on a good diet, but I have to try it.  It would be in polite.  Oh, my God.  Ice cream is so good.  I'm going to have such gassers on the plane today, too, because lactose does that to me.  Oh, no.  Yeah.  That's my main motivation, I'm trying some ice cream.  Oh, no.  That's right.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Jimmy goes, yeah.  What's the story behind the ice cream there? 
[01:46:30]  Well, you know, I'm on this television program called Celebrity Apprentice.  Yes, we do know that.  And the final task.  I'm a finalist.  Mm-hmm.  You know?  And last time I was here, I was already a finalist, but I kept it from you.  I know you did.  I did.  I kept it from you.  We tried to get it out of you, too.  I know.  I know.  But you knew in your heart.  Yeah, we did.  You're like Nixon.  You know in your heart he's right.  How good is the ice cream?  Oh, my God.  So, we had a design for Walgreens, or as it is in New York, Duane Reade.  We had a design in ice cream. 
[01:47:00]  And Trace went with Carpet Fibers and Shit, as his flavor.  And I went with this rich vanilla ice cream with sea salt chocolate and fudge caramel candy pieces.  It's all about the sea salt, sir.  This is amazing.  Yes, it is.  And that's my idea.  Sea salt has taken over the world.  That's pretty good.  You just won.  I just nailed it.  I think I did, yeah.  Right when you said that, I got a taste of the chocolate with the sea salt.  Who would think that would be good with ice cream? 
[01:47:30]  It is.  Penn Jillette.  Exactly.  Celebrity apprentice.  That's the answer.  You're also a magician with ice cream, my friend.  And it's $100,000 to whoever sells the most ice cream to our charities.  I thought per carton.  Yeah.  And it would be a bargain at that, wouldn't it?  Wait, I got to ask one question before I endorse your ice cream.  Yeah.  Does the other guy have peanut butter in his ice cream?  No.  Oh, I hate peanut butter.  I'm all in.  I'm all in.  He has macadamia maple.  Oh, really?  No, that's terrible.  That's a good reaction.  That is the, that is it.  This is all American. 
[01:48:00]  When I said, when I said carpet fibers and shit, you went, yeah.  When I say macadamia maple, though.  Ew.  You know, and my charity is a charity, Opportunity Village in Vegas.  It's kind of a David and Goliath thing.  Mm-hmm.  Because he's got, you know, I was hoping he would go for American Nazi Party.  Right.  But instead, he went for Red Cross.  Oh, okay.  Which is a fine charity, but, you know, $100,000 to a local charity in Vegas that helps people  with intellectual disabilities get jobs.  Right.  Is huge. 
[01:48:30]  You know, $100,000 to the Red Cross.  It's like, ah, fuck you.  $100,000.  Yeah, yeah.  We got that up our ass.  So, you know, I'm hoping.  And I've been eating this ice cream, you know, because I go on shows.  Yeah.  You know, and I eat the ice cream for show, but I still end up eating it.  I love it.  It's so good.  And I mean this very sincerely.  That might be the best ice cream I've ever eaten.  I'm not being polite because you're here.  Well, thank you.  That is fucking amazing.  Did you actually come up with this?  Yes.  You're a winner.  That's the nutty thing about Celebrity Apprentice.  Because I don't know what's real with that shit.  Well, no.  Most of Celebrity Apprentice is just real. 
[01:49:00]  They don't read stuff behind the camera.  They don't do retakes.  All that stuff I've done on every other show, they don't do.  Is there a way I could bet on the winner?  Because you got this.  You got this.  Okay.  Well, good.  You know, I hope so.  Hold on.  I had a second question.  So you came up with this, right?  Yeah.  It's an amazing flavor.  Jimmy's saying it's the best ice cream you've ever eaten.  I really mean it.  I can't stop.  Does freaking Donald Trump own this ice cream now, or do you got a piece of the action?  I have a piece of the action after a year.  Oh!  No one's going to care in a year. 
[01:49:30]  Wait, don't say that.  Please, don't say that.  There's going to be another ice cream in a year.  You just throw me away.  Discard me like you're cum-filled socks in the bottom of the bed, don't you?  I'm looking out for you.  Oh, that Donald Trump is tough is what I'm getting at.  You come up with this amazing flavor, and you don't get the action until a year from  now.  This has longevity.  Yeah, people will come back to this.  You think it has longevity?  Plus, Penn's famous enough to go out and promote it yourself after.  You are famous, Penn.  Well, thank you.  You're very famous.  You look thinner, too.  Oh, my God. 
[01:50:00]  I'm thinner and famous.  They go together.  Look at Angelina Jolie.  And so I'm a finalist.  I'm a finalist on the show.  Congrats.  You got this.  It's me and Tracy.  We don't know.  I think it should be very, very close.  But the funny thing is, every other year, most of the years, they've had real animosity  with the two finalists.  Right.  And Tracy and I get along great.  You get along, yeah.  Yeah.  Get along wonderfully.  Because, you know, why would there be animosity on a television show? 
[01:50:30]  But there sometimes is.  Yeah, well, people get very competitive.  We're competitive.  We're doing the best we can.  I think sometimes they make drama, you know?  You guys get along, though?  Very well.  You performers.  Yeah.  This ice cream is ridiculous.  I gave mine to Sam.  I ate, like, fucking five bites.  It's crazy.  You're not going to get mad if I throw this away, because I can't eat this whole fucking thing.  Give it to someone.  It's too good.  It's so goddamn good.  Wow.  And it's only until Saturday that it counts. 
[01:51:00]  I've gotten to this whole part.  You know, there's a bunch of...  Every Walgreens, every Duane Reade has it.  I suggest very strongly you not even try his flavor.  Yeah.  And if you try his flavor, it doesn't help me at all.  Let me tell you something.  Don't try his flavor, because the guy hasn't come on our show.  He doesn't come on your show?  No, it's all about Penn Jillette.  Good.  Don't even try the other flavors.  Just buy Penn's ice cream.  Do you like it?  Macadamia maple.  Maple.  It sounds terrible.  Yeah, well, I don't care for it, but some people do.  Maple's only good on pancakes.  That's a niche. 
[01:51:30]  That's it.  That's a niche flavor.  This is a flavor for the people.  This is universal.  This is the people's flavor.  You got your vanilla and your chocolate right in there.  It's all American.  You are.  Dude, that's so goddamn good.  I'm tempted to just keep eating this.  I never really eat ice cream.  I'm sea-salting my ass off right now.  Oh, my God.  Look at this shit.  All right.  One more big fucking spoonful.  How does he compete?  That other one sounds awful.  Yeah, well, you know, it would be nice to win.  If I do not win, if I do not bring home the bacon for O&A, will you still love me? 
[01:52:00]  Yes.  I'll like you more if you lose, because I'll relate to you.  Oh, by the way, on Penn Sunday School, for those who listen, this Sunday is Jim's show.  Oh, good, good, good.  Because I'll be here doing Celebrity Apprentice.  We're rolling that in now.  So you'll be on.  That was a really good show.  I understand why you have him on here.  He's good all the time.  Thank you.  You finally have an understanding, yes, of why we have this guy on here. 
[01:52:30]  Sam, you're enjoying your ice cream?  It's delicious.  When is the finale for Celebrity Apprentice?  This weekend?  Sunday, yeah.  Okay, so we're right there now.  And that's live?  Yeah.  Oh, it is, okay.  Well, they do a two-hour show.  They roll in about an hour, and then we come out, and they try to get us to, I guess, arm wrestling.  How hard is it not to tell people you're a finalist?  You know, um...  You had to keep that quiet for how long now?  How about four or five months?  One of my...  In my skill set, keeping secrets is there. 
[01:53:00]  That is true.  That is true.  Oh, fuck me, man.  You know, I could also...  I could deliberately mislead you if I want.  I don't even have to do that.  What you did.  What you did.  And the NBC says to me, you know, this is very important that you keep...  I go, yeah, we catch bullets in our teeth.  I can...  I can...  I think I can handle this.  Yeah.  I talk an awful lot, but you'd be surprised at how much I'm shutting up.  How little you say.  Yes.  I don't give you the hints when I'm not supposed to. 
[01:53:30]  No idea.  And I do want to say, because this is something I...  Is that my charity, Opportunity Village, which will be buying the ice cream for at Walgreens,  Dwayne Reed, it was Elvis' favorite charity.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  You know the scarves that Elvis used to take off his neck and wipe his ground and kiss  and throw it?  Every single one of those was made at Opportunity Village.  Opportunity Village, you know, people with intellectual disabilities, gives them jobs, helps them  get jobs in the community, but they also had a workshop that just made Elvis' scarves. 
[01:54:00]  Jeez.  So, as I said to Mr. Trump, and I will say again on the finale, I said, you know, if you're  not for me, you're against my charity.  And if you're against my charity, you're against Elvis.  And if you're against Elvis, sir, fuck you.  What else could he say?  Yeah, he used to...  Every one of the scarves that he would take.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  And I have one of the scarves.  One of the real Elvis ones.  Oh, you do?  Yeah.  The guy would put...  Who is that would put on his back?  Elvis would throw one out, and then someone would drape one on his back.  Yeah, yeah.  Put a new one on. 
[01:54:30]  I forget the guy's name.  The women would go wild.  With the Beatles, you know everybody in the band, George Martin, everything.  With Elvis, there's just Elvis.  Just Elvis.  Maybe Scotty Moore.  Maybe you know the guitar player.  But if you say to somebody, you know who's Elvis' favorite drummer, no idea.  So the guy who put the scarves on, not a chance of knowing.  Yeah, he's way out of the mix.  Yeah, yeah.  I met his best friend at Dyson's wedding, Jerry...  Okay, I'm getting close to you there.  Yeah, Jerry...  Because you got that Elvis connection.  A little bit.  The brother of the guy who put the scarves on Elvis. 
[01:55:00]  I don't know what he did.  Jerry something.  I don't know what it is.  But he's saying he was best friends with Elvis.  Would Elvis say the same thing if he was alive?  Yeah, he's in all the fucking Elvis videos.  I know, I keep dipping into the damn ice cream.  I'm actually staring at Penn's ice cream like it's tits.  Because I don't want to throw it away in front of him.  That's not the reason.  You're actually enjoying it, aren't you?  I already said I'm enjoying it, but I'm enjoying it so much I don't want to eat the whole damn thing.  I just gave mine to fucking Sam.  I'd save it for later, but it's going to melt all over the place.  I would never have thought that's sea salt. 
[01:55:30]  You taste it in the chocolate.  Sea salt.  Oh, there's a little salt in there.  It's good ice cream.  We get the dark chocolate with the sea salt at home.  We got to go into a lab.  It was like a food lab.  And I'm thinking, they're putting us in the coats and shit.  I'm thinking, yeah, this is wanky.  This is just your fucking TV.  And then you go in there, and there's actually a person whose life is making ice cream.  And they get all this stuff, and she goes, well, what do you like?  And I started telling her, I was doing like a turtle type thing. 
[01:56:00]  Some sea salt, some chocolate.  And she said, can't use the word turtle.  It's trademarked.  Because I thought I would have turtle ice cream.  It's called Swirtle.  I would get turtle ice cream, and then I would get Howard Kalin and Mark Volman, who are friends of mine, the turtles, to play at the final party.  Oh, wow.  They're happy together.  They said, oh, no, no.  Turtles with ice cream, other people own that.  That's copyright problems.  They do, huh?  So he went with Swirtle.  I like Swirtle.  It's kind of catchy. 
[01:56:30]  It's very catchy.  It's got the swirl of chocolate in there.  Did you ever think you would see someone you knew on the carton of a dairy product, Jim, that wasn't locked in your closet?  No, not at all.  Exactly.  I've got quite a few of the milk cartons autographed.  Magic Swirtle.  There it is.  Yeah, yeah.  And a picture of me.  Yes.  You know?  A picture of me on an ice cream.  You can stare at that while you spoon out the ice cream.  Yeah, exactly.  Treat for the talent in the eyes. 
[01:57:00]  Let your mind go wild as you eat the ice cream.  What happens?  You go through the process of trying it, and you take a bite, and then they call you back in an hour, and they go, all right, we've done this.  No, no.  They have this monster instant freeze machine.  Wow.  And you kind of go, the vanilla's a little cloying.  And they go, okay, let's pull it back a little bit.  And they go, and you go, and Dennis Rodman has this incredibly sophisticated ice cream palette. 
[01:57:30]  So Dennis Rodman's sitting there going, a little bit more salt.  Really?  And she goes, okay.  And you go, wow, because I was satisfied with the ice cream like three steps before Dennis was.  Right, right.  You know?  And so Dennis is just tasting, tasting, tasting, and Dennis goes, it's perfect.  I go, okay, Dennis, go get dressed for the party.  You just brought him along, or he was on your team?  He was on my team.  I was on the team.  So we had Dennis, LaToya, and Lisa Renna were my team. 
[01:58:00]  And we put it together.  How's LaToya?  Is she nuts?  You know, I'm.  Is she nuts?  No, she isn't.  I know.  That's why I'm asking you.  It's surprising.  Because we all think, people that have met her say that she's not nuts, but she certainly  portrays that she's nuts.  It's remarkable because we had, I didn't get to work with Dennis or with LaToya for the  whole season.  And then they threw them on my team at the end as kind of a change-up, you know, to see  how we do.  And LaToya, I was kind of hesitant because I had never worked with her, so I thought that 
[01:58:30]  she was nuts.  And I thought she was really straightforward and kind of smart.  I don't mean, you know, smart like Richard Feynman's smart.  Like, I don't think Stockholm is on the phone going, which Nobel do we give her?  It's kind of tough.  It's either chemistry or medicine.  She's got both in the bag.  We can't give her both.  Which do we do?  I don't think Stockholm's having any trouble with that.  But for show business, which, you know, is a whole, that's the special Olympics of 
[01:59:00]  intellect.  Who's she above in smarts?  Well, you know.  Who's just below her in smarts?  Just below her in smarts?  I don't know.  Probably Stephen Baldwin.  Okay.  All right.  Very good answer, yeah.  That is a very good answer.  And, you know, I like them both, and LaToya's great.  And then LaToya, you know, Teller comes in for the final task, and the cameras are all  rolling, and LaToya's having this conversation with Teller, and Teller's looking at her and  smiling, and she takes about five minutes to realize that Teller doesn't talk. 
[01:59:30]  And then we realize that LaToya Jackson has never heard of that.  Oh, no.  She is one of them.  That sucks.  Oh, man.  And so she learns that Teller doesn't talk, unlike Leon Russell.  You know, I was on Fallon with Leon Russell, who's a big hero of mine, you know, played with  a wrecking crew on every single from, like, 61 to 64, the piano was Leon Russell.  Every single that comes out, you know, from Gary Lewis, you know, and the Playboys to 
[02:00:00]  all that stuff is all Leon Russell.  And, of course, then the Joe Cocker, and then the stuff on his own.  And he's there in a wheelchair with a long beard and a long hair, and I walk up, and  I go, Mr. Russell, so nice to meet you.  He goes, I don't suppose your partner's going to talk to me.  Oh, there you go.  So he knows, though.  Wow.  Leon Russell knows.  Because that, I'm okay with that.  With people that, like, Leon Russell should never have heard of Penn & Teller.  Yeah, yeah.  He's got better things to do. 
[02:00:30]  But LaToya Jackson, she's got five minutes.  Find out who Penn & Teller is.  Yeah, yeah.  But I had them on my team, and it was, you know, the surprising thing about Celebrity  Apprentice is, first of all, everybody else bitches about the hours, because you work  from, like, 5 a.m. to 10 p.m., and that's, like, my usual work day, so I'm okay.  Yeah, yeah.  But everybody else is like, whoa, that's long and tedious.  And it's also pretty fun, because you get to go into a lab and see how they make ice 
[02:01:00]  cream, which I didn't know.  I know.  Like, a lab, you just think, oh, you know, they bring in some milk and freeze it.  I think there's, like, a lab coat and people in a sterile environment doing testing.  And also, as you said, you think you leave for, like, two hours and come back.  You don't think they got magic cold machine to, like, a James Bond villain.  You know, Batman, Mr. Freeze.  Oh, you want ice cream instantly?  Bang!  You would think that quality wouldn't be as good out of that instant freeze. 
[02:01:30]  Well, have you ever had liquid nitrogen ice cream?  No.  Oh, then you have not lived, sir.  Really?  Find yourself a supplier, because it's illegal.  Because, you know, what I do, other people do illegal stuff.  It's like drugs and hoops.  When I do illegal stuff, it involves sub-zero gases.  Right.  But you can get yourself, through a welding company and a little bribe on the side, you  can get yourself a container of liquid nitrogen.  You know, they used to do it in the school shows.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  They'd freeze a banana and smash it.  The rose and smash it.  And then you just take a metal mixing bowl, and you put in some cream, some sugar, you know, 
[02:02:00]  some swirtle.  Put that into a bowl, just as soup.  And then you take a doer, as it's called in the chemistry biz.  See, Stockholm's got me on speed call.  And you pour it into there while you mix it.  Now, of course, if you spill too much on, you get frostbite, and you, you know, die.  Yeah, true.  But, you know, that's why they try to keep it illegal.  Fucking pigs.  Just because it can really fuck you up making ice cream. 
[02:02:30]  And then you stir it in, and really, in like six seconds, it makes a whole batch of ice cream.  And, of course, it's liquid nitrogen, so it goes right into the air.  It's gone.  There are no bubbles in it.  No, nothing.  It's just this really smooth, beautiful ice cream made really, really wicked fast.  Why isn't that supplied to the people, like in stores?  Well, because making it with liquid nitrogen is really dangerous. 
[02:03:00]  See, I'm suggesting when you do stuff that's dangerous, it's like heroin, which there's a really strong upside to.  Right.  You know.  That is true.  The upside, the downside is you lose your hand.  The upside is the ice cream is terrific.  Exactly.  Exactly.  And risk-reward, it's not up there with heroin.  It's just not the same.  Risk-reward with heroin is you've got some sores all over your body, and you feel like you're coming 24 hours a day.  That's a good risk-reward, right?  A few sores on your body, I feel great. 
[02:03:30]  But lose a hand, have a good thing of ice cream, you've got to be in that special pendulum category.  This is pretty good, though.  I know.  This is really, really good.  No nitrogen used, but pretty goddamn good.  It's ridiculously good.  Yeah.  I know.  I keep digging in.  And you guys will be, I'm sure your listeners will run out and buy cases, and also, you  know, hide traces, you know, over behind the rocky road or something.  Yeah, yeah.  You don't need that.  You don't need that at all.  Terrible flavor.  And then there's this wonderful chocolatey vanilla pudding. 
[02:04:00]  Where do they go again?  Walgreens?  Well, Walgreens, which is Dwayne Reed.  Okay.  It's a whole thing.  But you're national.  You're bad.  You're nationwide.  Oh, yeah.  It's crazy.  It's Walgreens most of the places.  I love that song.  It's easy to talk.  But I'm not even kidding.  People are asking me on PalTalk here.  They're like, is it really good, Anthony?  Or are you just saying?  I'm like, no, this is fucking great.  Because you would lie on the air, but not on PalTalk.  Not on PalTalk.  Exactly.  Right?  You're right.  You're going to type, yeah, I'm saying it's good, but boy, it really sucks.  That must be a new... 
[02:04:30]  We sure pulled it over on all those people.  That's got to be a new listener, because they all know we'll tell if it's good or not after  he leaves.  Exactly.  Yeah.  You're going to let Penn go.  He's got a busy day.  He's a very busy man.  They're telling us, by the way.  For real.  Amazing ice cream.  I really...  I love this stuff.  I'm going out and buying some.  Good.  And bringing it home.  Please.  Cases.  And it only counts until Saturday.  There will still be ice cream after that, but I don't give a fuck about it after that. 
[02:05:00]  I want for my charity.  Buy it right now.  Get the ice cream.  And it's wicked good.  It's one of the few times you can actually eat ice cream.  And be helping a charity.  This money does not go to a certain P. Gillette.  This money...  I mean, for all you want to be cynical about Celebrity Apprentice, I am looking, if I do  it right, $350,000 for a charity that really does great work.  That's huge.  Of course, if I lose, it's $350,000 for a charity that also does great work. 
[02:05:30]  But anyway...  But you want to be the guy.  I would like to be the guy.  So we're not even going to mention the other guy.  I think you're in.  But you're selling ice cream with the other guy right here in New York City.  I think you're in.  Penn State.  Penn Jillette's Swizzle, right?  Swertle.  Swertle.  Swertle.  Swertle.  Swizzle.  Jesus.  Swertle.  Swertle.  Swertle.  Swertle.  Swertle.  Swertle.  Swertle.  Swertle.  Swertle.  Swertle's really small on the packaging.  All right.  There he goes.  Go buy Penn's ice cream.  Look, he's not in the room.  It's so fucking good.  Yeah, of course he is.  You can't stop eating this shit.  Your sister came to our show. 
[02:06:00]  Yes, she loves you.  Oh, in Vegas?  Yeah, Dawn came.  And, oh, she loved the show.  She just fucking can't say enough about it.  You know, really, really not hard to believe she's your sister.  Why?  They have to carry her out drunk?  I didn't have to ask for any ID whatsoever.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  She said it.  It just, you know, there's a family resemblance.  Yeah.  There's a style.  Dawn rules.  She was great.  She had such a great time.  She was thrilled to death to meet you. 
[02:06:30]  It was great.  And people were thrilled she was in the audience.  Because she came up, you know, after the show and announced pretty clearly who she was.  She's hilarious.  And people around were like, oh, yeah, oh, yeah, yeah.  What a yap on her.  That's great, you know.  What a yap on her.  She was posing for pictures of us together, but then also for other people.  Oh, that's hilarious.  She's a person.  She had such a great time, though.  Yes.  She loves your show.  Yeah, we had a wonderful...  We didn't know she was there.  You should have let us know. 
[02:07:00]  We would have set you up and stuff.  But she just came like a regular punter.  Yeah, like a regular person.  Yeah.  We didn't give her fancy, fancy O&A nepotism seats.  We have the O&A nepotism section, but that was empty that night, and there she was.  Yeah, it's a great show, man.  It's just, what a blast.  Well, thank you.  Yeah, it's great.  We're doing, I've got to tell you, Celebrity Apprentice sure moves tickets.  I mean, we're filled up all the time now.  It opens you up to people that probably normally wouldn't do it. 
[02:07:30]  Yeah, it's amazing, you know, and forgive me if this sounds unpleasant, but I thought that  there were a lot of people who didn't like Penn & Teller, but I didn't know there were  that many people who had never heard of Penn & Teller.  You know, no idea.  People that come to the show and go, I never heard of you guys until Celebrity Apprentice.  I've been around for how long.  That's unbelievable.  And you just, you know, and I say, well, yeah, and they love the show, and now they're 
[02:08:00]  new fans, and now I say, well, in terms of economics, the people you want coming to  your show are people that have never heard of you before, because then you're starting  a whole new market.  But I just go, man, I thought you all made your decision on us about 93.  Right, right.  About 93, you decided, they suck, or I like them, the battle lines were drawn, and you  moved on through your life, you know?  Who are these, I don't even know who they are people who do not know Penn & Teller, right?  No clue, no clue.  And really, they would come, and after the show, they'd go, I didn't know you did a 
[02:08:30]  magic show.  Oh, my God.  I saw you at Celebrity Apprentice.  And we just did one of the Indian casinos somewhere, you know, Biloxi or something, you  know?  Yeah.  And this guy comes up to me.  I'm on my way to, like, the steakhouse before the show.  And he says to me, watch your Celebrity Apprentice, no idea what you do, but I'm coming to see  you tonight.  Wow.  Wow.  I mean, now that's a great deal of support.  Yeah.  That's really great.  I just kind of go, wow, no idea what I do. 
[02:09:00]  Boy, that's kind of a kick in the ass.  Kind of like, shit.  Saturday Night Live, Letterman, you know, bullshit, all those things, just blew right  by.  There's a certain segment of the population that doesn't know, you know?  Shit.  And I was talking to Bob Dylan's manager, who said, you think you're surprised.  Oh, wow.  No.  All right.  No fucking way.  And I said, no fucking way.  No fucking way.  Occasionally I'm on the phone and I'll say I work with Bob Dylan and they'll go, who?  No. 
[02:09:30]  Come on.  And I went, okay, I'm fine with this then.  You're fine.  Yeah.  Wow.  And then he started listing things.  He said, Fargo.  Everybody you know saw Fargo, right?  Yeah.  I go, yeah.  He goes, not a very successful movie.  Goodfellas.  Everybody you know saw Goodfellas, right?  Yeah.  A lot of people haven't heard of it.  He said, just, you know, Elvis used to go crazy.  Who?  That there were.  Perfectly timed.  That there were Aboriginal people in New Guinea that had not heard of him, you know? 
[02:10:00]  And I got over that long ago.  I realized that out of the 7 billion people on the planet, 7 billion haven't heard of Penn & Teller.  If you round it off, 7 billion.  I kind of thought this small little chunk of the world, this, you know, 350 to 400 million,  this tiny little drop of human humanity, who uses most resources, tiny little drop of humanity,  had kind of, and I'm not saying beloved. 
[02:10:30]  I'm not saying no well.  I'm just saying, oh, Penn & Teller, nah.  You know, that's all I'm requiring out of you.  Penn & Teller, nah.  You know, that's just, yeah.  I know that I exist.  But just those two words, together with an ampersand between them, mean nothing.  Nothing.  You know, hegemony.  It's the same exact thing.  I don't know what that word means.  Don't know what Penn & Teller means.  Boom.  No idea.  I wanted to ask you something about bullshit, because I was watching it recently. 
[02:11:00]  I fucking love the show.  Was it harder as time went on to get people that weren't on to the fact that you might fucking say some nasty shit about them?  Well, let me tell you, you know, I have a real problem with Michael Moore, and even with Borat.  You know, I have a little problem with misrepresenting.  Right.  We would go to the people and say, we do a show called bullshit.  Here is a DVD. 
[02:11:30]  Penn & Teller disagree with you.  Do you want to go on the show?  You know, that's what we would say.  Next thing you say, I'm Dr. Maury Smith, and I think...  And we had all sorts of video of people, like, picking their nose and all this stuff.  We would never use it.  We tried to attack ideas.  As a matter of fact, as the years went on, I kept saying, well, you know, we can be mean to the guys on our side.  Yeah.  So we actually would have more trouble getting people to agree with us, because they'd go, I've been noticing this show... 
[02:12:00]  Yeah, it's your trend.  Yeah, you just...  You attack our ties and how we look and our hair.  Yeah.  Like, well, that's because we agree with you.  We don't want to make it too easy for you.  You know, so like the guys from Reason Magazine, like Nick Gillespie, like the Libertarian guys...  Right.  ...who we would call up, like, every three shows and have the same people on, people from the Cato Institute and stuff.  We'd have them on.  They'd go, well, last time you had me on, you're like, really fucked with me.  We go, yeah, we agree with everything you said.  They said, yeah, but what's wrong with my suit jacket? 
[02:12:30]  Or hair or something.  Yeah, you're constantly betting.  But, you know, we would have...  And there's a sad side of this, too, which is that everybody that we would have on and bash and tear to pieces and rip a new asshole, they would do better after they were on the show.  Oh, man.  Yeah, well...  So, they all knew that, you know, and they all knew they would go through that.  They also knew that we would attack their ideas, but not their...  You know, we did one thing on this show, which I thought was really funny.  I did this thing where I said, you know, people think we take people out of context. 
[02:13:00]  They think that we pull out the stupidest thing they say.  We would like to show you a minute and a half of what we get as raw material, not context.  And we had one of the, I think it was on the Bible show, the creationism show, we had a guy do his full hunk without editing.  And it was really funny.  Because we would do our editing to make them look better.  Because, you know, if you're doing drama, your hero is only as strong as your villain. 
[02:13:30]  Right, yes.  So, if you have people that are too...  You know, James Bond wants to have a really, really good villain.  You don't want James Bond going up against a 16-year-old shoplifter.  You know?  It's easy.  It's easy to discredit somebody if their argument sucks or they're stupid or they come off looking ridiculous.  We would spend all this time making the enemies look really, really good and concise so that I could come in and go,  Man, Penn just took that fucker apart. 
[02:14:00]  Whereas in reality, if you saw the full hour and a half, you know, a six-year-old could have taken him apart.  So we would be buoying people up.  But they always knew.  And the amazing thing I'll tell you, we did eight years of bullshit.  Eight years, something like almost 90 shows, I think.  And not one lawsuit that stuck at all.  I mean, one person threatened.  Two people threatened, but never took legal action.  That's as close as they came.  So we were really careful. 
[02:14:30]  And you would love, and I told you this last time, but it's worth repeating.  You know, the lawyers.  We worked with the same lawyers for eight years.  And they would get really good at giving notes.  The notes of the script.  And we really should have these up on the web or something.  Because in this very, very legal hand of a $600-an-hour lawyer, they would say,  Not sure about this wording.  Could you call him cocksucker instead?  Not sure if this is actionable. 
[02:15:00]  Maybe pull out cunt pickle.  Pull out that.  Would that be better?  And then circled.  And then you also see stuff you never thought you'd see.  You never saw in your high school paper.  Which is cunt pickle, circled, next to it, good.  We're really safe.  Because, you know, after eight years, you really run out of obscenity.  Oh, true.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  You know, you really, you say.  Same old thing over and over.  We've used motherfucker eight times in this show. 
[02:15:30]  Yeah, yeah.  And, you know, we need, we need something else.  And when they told us, I was really proud of this.  They told us for the chiropractor show that absolutely nowhere in the show, any place,  could I even hint at the word quack.  Quack.  They said, you say the word quack, I'm telling you, you'll lose your house.  It's that simple.  They're all listening.  Their lawyers are all on.  Keep that away.  And by the way, for those listening now, I'm not saying chiropractors are quacks. 
[02:16:00]  I'm just saying we couldn't say those two things.  So I'm going, you know, I just feel like such a pussy not, not being able to use the word  the whole show.  So I said, for the shoot, I wrote in the script, you know, for the call sheet, I wrote, we want  100 ducks.  Yes.  100 ducks.  And we just dumped ducks all over the set.  And I was just going, sue them.  Just sue them all you want. 
[02:16:30]  Try to go, you know, we're talking about chiropractor.  And I never said it.  And the ducks are all over it.  We never even explained.  We never said, like, they're speaking for us.  Never underlined in nothing.  And we did the multi-level marketing.  I love that one.  The word you can't use is pyramid.  So we had a, you know, a blue screen of Gaza behind us with the pyramids. 
[02:17:00]  And we were in Egyptian outfits.  And no mention of pyramid scheme.  You couldn't say that word?  No.  Oh, no.  Oh, no, no, no, no.  I couldn't say pyramid.  Wait, are you worried, too, when you say, like, they're all watching, like, if you say  so-and-so's a quack or this profession's a quack, that people watching in that profession  can sue because you're hurting them?  Or just people?  It's very, very difficult if we say chiropractic in general.  Da-da-da-da-da.  But our problem was we had a particular person on screen.  Right, right, okay.  And then if the show included that, that could be all stopping them from making a living. 
[02:17:30]  Right.  Definition of character.  There's all sorts of things that are there.  And also all sorts of things that I hate it when this is true, but a lot of times the  law is correct, you know?  And you shouldn't be able to rip an individual apart without me doing due diligence.  And what exactly would be due diligence for me to call someone a quack?  I mean, how much research do I have to do before, in good conscience?  I'm not even talking legally, but morally, how much do you have to know before you discredit 
[02:18:00]  someone's entire medical practice?  Yeah, yeah.  Now, in general, it's really easy to do.  And in theory, it's really easy to do.  But an individual, you want to be very, very careful.  And they could easily call people that would say, this person helped me and changed my  life.  Sure, sure.  So that there goes your argument with you.  That poor bastard that was selling the drinks on that multi-level.  Oh, that was heartbreaking.  Oh, I felt so bad for that.  I mean, that was one of the shows where we didn't really have villains.  No, no.  We were so much on their side.  It was just a fucking cast of victims, that show. 
[02:18:30]  Can you explain?  I don't see that one.  Multi-level marketing are like when they have a product that you sell to your friends.  Right, right.  Of course.  And there's always X amount of money to get in.  So you pay $5,000 and you get a case of this stuff that you're going to sell to your friends.  And it's never about selling this stuff.  It's about selling the business to another.  Of course.  So the stuff, you can't possibly make money on this stuff.  You sell the whole business.  Yeah, I want to know about the guy that you felt sorry for.  So, you know, we did this when there was a real downturn in the economy and a lot of 
[02:19:00]  people who'd lost their jobs were investing $5,000, $10,000, $15,000 of their savings to  get into this business and then trying to get their other friends into it and then finding  out that they didn't want to rip off their friends and had a cellar full of shit they  couldn't sell and had also taken, I mean, if you lose your job, even if you don't lose  your job, $5,000 is a serious chunk of change.  You know, it's not like, we're not looking at people losing like $100, you know, which 
[02:19:30]  still is a serious amount of change.  That's a lot of groceries.  I don't mean to dismiss that.  But I'm talking about $5,000 changes what you do for the next two months.  It really does change what you do.  No matter who you are, that changes it.  And we were getting people to put this money in and these were people who had been ripped  off and sucked in and, you know, were on camera going, you know, I'm not going to sell  this business to my friends because I would just be ripping off my friends.  Yeah.  Because they realized, like, it just doesn't. 
[02:20:00]  So I guess I'm just kind of eating this.  When he went to, when that one guy.  How bad was the product, though?  It doesn't matter.  I mean.  It's a widget.  It doesn't matter.  Right.  The products are all okay.  Just okay, though.  You know.  Yeah.  But I mean, they're not.  It doesn't matter.  Not worth pushing.  It doesn't matter how good they are.  The fact is you can't make money unless you sell the whole business.  Yeah.  And it's simple.  It's one of those simple things you see.  It's shaped like a triangle.  Yeah.  Exactly.  Can I ask that?  Like a three-dimensional triangle.  Legally, why wouldn't somebody classify as pyramid? 
[02:20:30]  Is the pyramid thing kind of like a, is that a copywritten thing?  No.  Pyramid is a legal term.  Oh.  A Ponzi scheme or pyramid.  Like a Ponzi scheme would be, let's say, Social Security.  There you go.  Which is, if you get it early, you make a lot of money.  I'm just telling you right now, if you're under 25, Social Security, you're getting fucked.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Just in case no one else has told you that, at least you can hear it on O&A.  All the money you put into Social Security, you are not getting it back. 
[02:21:00]  It's as simple as that.  Look at classic pyramid schemes.  The base can never support what's on top of it.  No, they can't.  The big trick of a pyramid scheme is be the first guy.  Be that fucking pointy stone.  If you haven't thought of the pyramid scheme yourself, you don't want to be involved in it.  Exactly.  If you've thought of it yourself, you've got a good chance of getting your money back.  I went to one of those.  I remember the company name and everything.  When I was newly sober, a guy in the program took me, and it was probably like 1988 or something like that, 
[02:21:30]  and he took me to one of these companies, and I was like, oh God, this isn't a good...  And then something inside me went, eh, shit.  Well, I got taken to an Amway meeting, and it's very vague.  No one wants to tell you what it is.  It's like, just come.  It's a great opportunity.  And you're like, what?  What is it?  No, it's got to be presented.  The whole thing's got to be presented.  They never tell you first.  You can't...  So I sit there, and there's a woman, and she's got a chalkboard, and she's writing, and...  She's making a big triangle.  And she's going, and going, and going, yeah, yeah, yeah. 
[02:22:00]  And I'm sitting there going, like, what the fuck is this?  And she goes, well, this was known as...  And she writes, on the blackboard, she's like, the American way.  It's like, this is the American way, selling things.  She goes, we shortened it to Amway.  And I'm like, fuck, they got me.  Fuck.  That's brilliant.  God damn it.  And I'm sitting there like, oh, gosh.  See, I'm thinking the big mistake is getting people who are newly sober.  Don't you want people shit-faced drunk? 
[02:22:30]  What a great idea.  Well, I think when you're eager to change your life and do something, like, yeah, I'll just  sell this stuff.  It'll be great.  Were you actually selling this stuff, Am, for a while?  No, no.  I was fucking, like, pissed that I had to stay the rest of the meeting.  Yeah, you were like...  The second she's at Amway, because I heard about Amway, I never knew how it was presented.  If I did, I would have known this was...  The presentation got you, and you were like, fuck this.  So when they got me, and I'm like, what is she getting at?  Fucking get to the point.  Oh, fuck, it's Amway.  How long was it?  How long was the meeting?  It seemed like it's still going on. 
[02:23:00]  It's like the timeshare...  You ever gone to one of the timeshare things?  Where they say...  Free this and free that.  You just got to go to the timeshare.  Get a free hibachi.  Just sit through the whole thing.  Meanwhile, why don't you calculate what your time as a human is worth per hour, and how  much that hibachi ends up costing you in your time, right?  And the hibachi is also...  Because I went, because I wanted to learn about it.  So I went to the full timeshare.  In Vegas, you know, timeshare capital.  They put people off the strip to get a hibachi.  And it was, I think, four and a half hours to get a hibachi that I thought was probably 
[02:23:30]  worth about $3.  Right.  How does it work, the timeshare?  The timeshare is you buy a property that you can use two weeks a year.  Oh, two weeks.  Okay.  So, you know, or three weeks, whatever you buy.  We had one in our family.  You chip in with a bunch of people, and they give them a book.  Well, there's a company that sells them, and they break them up.  Basically, you got to go on vacation to the same shitty fucking condo every year.  That's what it comes down to.  And you have to...  How far in advance do you work out what weeks are yours? 
[02:24:00]  You know, all that depends.  It looks great at first, but then year after year, you're going back to the same place.  And then they'll also tell you that you can trade that for another place.  You know, you buy your timeshare in Terre Haute, and you can get the one in, you know, Aspen.  Yeah, sure.  Sure you can.  It turns out that deal's a little hard to make.  Yes.  Yes.  Yeah, because why would the Aspen guy go to your shitty place?  Yeah.  You're right.  But they do them everywhere, and every family, you know, every family has somebody in them 
[02:24:30]  that did that.  And all you've got to do is you've got to do the arithmetic, but you've got to do it on your  own.  Right.  You can't do the arithmetic with the guy they're helping you.  No.  Which is always good advice on any business deal.  Do your arithmetic in private.  Don't have the guy who's making the deal with you go, yeah, don't get...  You don't have to carry the three.  Oh, I guess I don't have to carry the three.  Right.  All right.  Just add it right now.  Whatever you say.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Oh, yeah. 
[02:25:00]  Yeah, it gets worse.  Let's get some asshole sniffing going.  Let's pep this place up into a mood of fun and festivity.  More of Opie and Anthony's worst of 2013.  So far, coming up.  Six months' worth of shows.  More than 500 hours of life.  Trimmed down to just one week of essential listening.  What's that?  That's 20 hours of mind-blowing radio.  Translation, we wasted well over 450 hours of your time already this year. 
[02:25:30]  Sorry.  This is Opie and Anthony's worst of 2013 so far.  It's the worst of 2013 so far with me, Sam Roberts.  You know, we just heard Pendulet talking about Celebrity Apprentice, and we were all for him winning.  But after his interview, I talked to the guys about what's been going on on Celebrity Apprentice  because they don't watch, and I'll watch every episode of every season of that goddamn show.  I don't know what it is, but to me, best reality show of all time.  And I let them know what Trace's appeal was and how they were skewing this thing. 
[02:26:00]  And our loyalty to Penn might have subsided a bit.  This is the guys learning about what a real American Trace Atkins is.  Opie and Anthony's worst of 2013 so far.  I've got to help out Pendulet because I'm learning the country guy, you know, is the favorite here, right?  Country artists have the whole country.  I forgot about that.  Trace Atkins is a formidable opponent because, number one... 
[02:26:30]  But he has a shitty ice cream.  No one likes maple in their ice cream.  Ha, ha.  Here's the brother.  Hi, hi, this is Trace Atkins.  He's got a great voice, man.  Doesn't he do?  That guy's fucking voice is so deep, and his talking voice, he does like a PSA or commercial or some shit,  and he's just, ha, this is Trace...  You can't even imitate it.  It's like all bottom end.  Do we know any of his songs?  Yeah.  He's big in country.  I'm Trace Atkins.  You know a Trace Atkins song?  For real?  Yeah.  I don't think I do.  Dancing by the Meadow. 
[02:27:00]  No, it isn't.  Oh, yeah.  This is new country, bitches.  Ladies love country, boys.  Do anyone want to fuck him?  What was that?  Jimmy?  I'm sorry.  Ice cream.  Oh, my God.  Ice cream.  Ice cream.  You scream.  Ice cream fucks in the studio.  Listen up deep, man.  Daddy wore a tie.  Mama never fried a chicken.  Ballet spray days most likely to see. 
[02:27:30]  Where is that, Atlanta?  Oh, Pendulet's fucked.  4.5 million hits on this.  I love this Trace Atkins guy.  4.5 million hits on that fucking video.  He gets pussy if he wants it?  He's done.  Yeah.  Poor Pend.  Plus, the country guys get money.  I don't know how they do it.  What do you mean?  But on the show, they do fundraising things.  Yeah.  And you just call your rich...  The celebrities call whatever rich celebrities they know to bring money.  Yeah.  And the country guys, especially like Trace, they get six figures from people.  Wow. 
[02:28:00]  Pen's so fucked.  Could you find a Trace Atkins PSA?  His ice cream's way better, too.  I think Trace Atkins PSA.  See if you can find...  Yeah.  Play one of these.  Listen to his speaking voice.  It's insane.  Food allergies result in more than 300,000 ambulatory care visits each year among children.  Hi, I'm Trace Atkins, and my daughter, Brianna, is one of the three million children in the  U.S. living with potentially life-threatening food allergies.  To learn more about food allergies, please speak with your doctor or visit foodallergy.org. 
[02:28:30]  More than 12 older Americans have food allergies.  He could, like, have a broadcasting career if he didn't have a semi-successful country career.  Oh, that's right.  A public service from Phan.  The food allergy and anaphylaxis...  The Phan!  Public service from The Phan!  Plus, he's playing for the American Red Crow.  Of course.  Oh, Pen's so fucked.  And his ice cream is way better.  I forgot the middle America country...  Like, country is the number one music, and...  It's not a vote.  No?  What?  It's not a vote.  People can't...  Donald Trump picks.  They've got to get out and buy it. 
[02:29:00]  But if they sell a lot of fucking ice cream...  Right.  I'm going to buy Trace Atkins ice cream.  I don't even know who that Jew is, that pen...  It's not a Jew.  He's a big Jew who don't like God.  I like Trace, and I like God.  I like an artist that loves the Lord, not the tribe that done killed him.  Yeah.  What?  He makes a lot of things disappear.  I don't trust him.  That pen Jewelette.  Jewelette.  Isn't that pen Jewelette?  He looks like a Jew. 
[02:29:30]  I just assumed.  They both got ponytails.  You might as well go with Trace.  I'm just glad I ain't got a pick-a-nigger.  Oh, my God.  What?  Wow.  Well, that's how they talk.  I mean, and little John was in the Final Four, so...  He was?  Yeah.  Thank God they got him out there.  You got some trickery.  You wanted to say that word today.  And you figured out how to say it.  Please.  It was the 20th time I said it already.  This hour.  It's 21, right, Ant?  20th. 
[02:30:00]  Oh, shit.  Fuck yeah, the cops.  Chip another cat.  I fucking had a fight with the cops.  Fuck yeah.  I threw all their guns away.  I'm like, go pick them up, flat foot.  Flat foot.  What's Trace's ice cream?  Maple and what else?  Macadamia.  Macadamia maple.  Oh, my God.  Who wants that shit?  You know what?  Macadamia and maple.  What's the basic flavor?  Like, in Penn's Lead.  Oh, so they're...  All right.  Yeah.  So vanilla's the base, and then it's maple and... 
[02:30:30]  Macadamia.  Maple and macadamia.  But it's got his picture on it?  What does his ice cream carton look like?  Let's see Trace's picture.  Because Trace is one of those country guys.  He looks like a real man.  I bet it's the same as Penn's, or no, but it's the design.  You think?  Oh, my God.  Same as man.  Look, with the cowboy hat, though, he's like, hi, I'm Trace Egg.  Exactly.  And who's a little more sexy?  Let's be honest.  Trace has his shirt unbuttoned a little bit up top.  Penn looks like a fucking...  Oh, our pal is fucked.  Penn looks like someone that worked on the fucking Manhattan Project. 
[02:31:00]  Right.  Yeah.  Oh, our pal's fucked.  But Penn Jillette looks like he could be Jewish.  He does.  His Trace looks like a good-time party fucking country boy.  I know.  Why didn't Penn Jew it down a little bit?  I know.  Fuck.  They actually have him standing in front of a bank with his fist raised.  Oh, my God.  You had to go less Jew-y.  I know.  For middle America.  They actually made the lid of the ice cream a yarmulke.  Just pull it off.  This pay is coming down the side. 
[02:31:30]  You're not supposed to write, buy this and God dies a slow death.  That's not going to sell.  There's a dude with a goatee and a cowboy hat and the American Red Cross logo next to him.  It couldn't be more American.  Why not support the troops?  Right.  I know.  Penn's got a yarmulke with an al-Qaeda thing.  Support Penn's ice cream.  That's the point we're making.  You just see American flag when you look at Trace's ice cream.  That's it.  I don't care what flavor.  I thought Penn had this.  I thought Penn had it in the bag, too.  And then I realized, ah, you know. 
[02:32:00]  You know what the best part about Celebrity Apprentice this whole season was?  Huh?  Watching everybody go into the boardroom.  And Donald Trump loves Gary Busey.  Yeah.  So he would never fire him.  And he would always say, who's the weakest player on the team?  Oh, no.  And the people would always be like, well.  Gary.  It was Gary.  But they knew every time.  Donald would be like, yeah, but Gary's kind of a genius.  So let's go beyond that.  Kind of a genius.  They would let him skate.  He would let him skate every time.  He likes Gary?  He loves Gary.  Gary made it to the top five.  I didn't get to. 
[02:32:30]  Sounds like.  I didn't watch this.  Sounds like the welfare system.  Fuck.  How is that?  You know, people that you know aren't that good and doing things.  All right.  And then they just keep getting supported and pushed along.  He's saying Donald Trump supports welfare?  They're not contributing.  Hey, why don't we get Trump on?  Gary Busey is a burden to that show.  And he should be removed and sent back to where he came from.  It's all ratings and he's good for the ratings.  Can we get Donald Trump on the phone?  Busey, right?  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  Can we get Donald Trump on the phone?  We can work on that, I think. 
[02:33:00]  We've got to help our pal out, Penn Jillette.  How are we going to do that, though?  We'll talk to Donald himself.  We're going to make sure we understand that, you know, Trace is an all-American guy, but  Penn deserves this.  One for the Jews.  We need to get him.  Now, what happens?  What happens?  Let's say Trace sells more ice cream.  He's going to.  But, okay.  Does it now instantly that Donald Trump is going to pick him?  There are multiple tasks to this task.  So you have to sell the most ice cream, but you also have to make the most money. 
[02:33:30]  So if Trace Adkin goes, hey, Garth Brooks, will you buy this one thing of ice cream for  $2 million?  No way!  They can do that?  100%.  That sounds cheating.  100% they can do it.  But that sounds like cheating.  They do it every season.  It's all for charity, so they don't care.  And they go, hey, I'm the...  Like, there are people on the show that are saying, you can't fire me.  I'm the biggest fundraiser.  And so if you have famous friends...  So then Penn can make his money disappear.  Trace's money disappear.  Right.  He's a magician.  Who's that?  I got more info on Trace Adkins. 
[02:34:00]  This guy does not lose.  What?  Oh, no.  Yeah.  I got to take this phone call.  I did not know.  We got to look this up and make sure it's true.  But Clint in Alabama.  Clint.  Hey, guys, I don't know if he got caught cheating on her or if she was just crazy, but  in 1994, his ex-wife shot him through the heart and the lungs, and he lived.  They don't lose.  Trace's...  Oh, yes.  How is he going to lose?  In 1994, his second wife shot him during an argument. 
[02:34:30]  He never pressed charges because he believed that she never meant to pull the trigger.  He's just a nice guy.  Oh, my God.  Atkins stated that their divorce was closure enough for him.  And the bullet went through his heart and his lungs?  How does that happen?  He said the only reason he lived through the incident was because he lived so close to  a hospital.  Oh, my God.  He's just a nice guy.  Yeah.  This is not good.  My interaction with him was very positive.  Oh, God.  You met Trace Atkins.  I walked by a window, and he, like, waved because he, I guess, had seen my act, and we 
[02:35:00]  took a picture together, and he was very nice.  Where's the picture?  I have it.  I got it signed.  I don't believe you.  I don't play games.  I don't believe you.  Yeah?  Yeah.  Mm-hmm.  E-Rock's saying we've got to read Blue Heeler's tweet.  I don't know where Blue Heeler's tweet is right now.  Exactly.  What does it say?  Why don't you just say it?  Who's Heeler?  Okay.  It says Trace Atkins has a PSA on food allergies, yet he's promoting a product with dairy and 
[02:35:30]  tree nuts in it.  Yeah, but he can't do no wrong.  That's our point.  Yeah.  That's our point.  He can't do no wrong.  Poor man.  The irony is so thick, he can cut it with a knife.  Plus, Trace was in Lincoln as Lincoln's lawyer.  He also has a character on King of the Hill.  Was he in Lincoln?  Oh, God.  Oh, man.  And then we learn a lot of people don't even know who Penn and Teller are after all these  years.  The thing he was talking about with Latoya was so funny.  It was on the episode.  Oh, yeah.  She was just like a little put off that Teller wouldn't talk to her. 
[02:36:00]  And then Mary Lou Henner or somebody had to be like, no, he doesn't talk.  He's been doing this for 30 years.  Yeah, that's like his gimmick, you dummy.  How does she not know who Penn and Teller is?  She's in the entertainment business.  That Jackson family is...  They're insulated, man.  I understand regular fucking, you know, Joe's.  Yeah.  Why not know who Penn and Teller are?  But if you're in the business, how do you not know?  Yeah. 
[02:36:30]  Let's say hi to Luke in Austin, Texas.  Luke.  Gentlemen, how are you all doing this morning?  We're doing all right, Luke.  Right on.  If you want to hear Trace Adkins' deep, deep voice in a commercial, pull up a commercial  called ASCO.  A-S-C-O.  That's not funny.  Dude's voice on this commercial is...  Wait, what's it called?  ASCO.  Why do people do that? 
[02:37:00]  It's funny.  ASCO, huh?  Yeah.  Chip loves it.  Wait, is it an ass company that they sell like assholes and stuff?  I don't know why they do that.  Oh, God.  All right, let's listen to this.  This might be the voice you were talking about.  All right, man.  I appreciate things like honesty, hard work, doing the job right.  That's what keeps everything going.  Kind of like the folks at ASCO.  Hard-working people, hard-working case equipment, and good honest baggage. 
[02:37:30]  By giving you rent to own, lease, and even return options on rugged case equipment.  He's selling fucking bulldozers.  But he makes you seem so American.  Go buy yourself a goddamn bulldozer.  I'm Trace Atkins for fucking Heavy Machinery.  Where is that commercial shown?  I don't know.  It's got to be the Midwest.  Oh, yeah.  Texas.  Texas, yeah.  Is he popular there?  You need a good fucking backhoe in Texas.  Put it this way.  Most of the country sees that commercial. 
[02:38:00]  Yeah.  We're just isolated here on the Northeast.  We don't think about that.  We think, you know, the city, the Northeast, it's everything.  We're the fucking minority in how this country thinks it works.  Big fucking time.  Yeah.  Well, congratulations to Trace Atkins for winning.  Trace Atkins.  Yeah.  And then another part of the task is, like, they have to make a video, like, a commercial  advertising the ice cream.  Right.  Oh, man.  And, of course, Trace's is going to be all, like, families and stuff.  I'm Trace Atkins.  If you love America.  You love Maple. 
[02:38:30]  You love Maple.  Oh, fucking.  They were showing Penn editing his commercial.  Yeah.  And they came across a, they didn't know what to do, because they only had one close-up of  the ice cream.  And right behind it, you could see two showgirls' bedazzled crotches.  Oh, no.  Next to the ice cream.  Oh, and he's going to be like, hi, I'm Trace Atkins.  Right.  I don't have any vaginas in my commercial.  This is about the Red Cross helping Americans.  Show a small boy that survived a fire. 
[02:39:00]  Yes.  Being soothed with ice cream salve.  And then that's Penn.  If you like the vagina, you'll like my ice cream.  Oh, God, Penn.  Yeah.  No bullshit.  Yeah.  It's over.  Yeah.  Maybe we could get Donald Trump, though, on the show.  Yeah, maybe we could sway him.  The Donald.  Maybe I'll make a hair joke.  Yeah.  Oh, it was a great joke.  What about the birthers?  Trace is the underdog, because he came, last time he was on Celebrity Apprentice, he made 
[02:39:30]  it to the finals.  Uh-huh.  Piers Morgan beat him.  Then again, fucking, uh, Penn Jillette is very light, and he has well over a million  on Twitter.  Trace Atkins only has 208,000.  Now, I'm not saying Twitter's everything, but he can reach a lot of people.  Wait, Trace Atkins only has a couple hundred thousand on Twitter.  Yeah, I have more than that.  Oh, really?  Whoa, ho, ho, ho.  I did not know that.  Okay, that's, uh, that's a good, good sign right there.  Yeah.  All right.  We'll see what happens.  So.  I'll just scream.  Oh, look at these two. 
[02:40:00]  Come on.  Like, who are you going to vote for?  I go with Penn Jillette.  I go with the more normal, relatable guy.  Yeah.  Well, the thing is.  But that's not what America is.  Trace is not more relatable, though.  To more of the country.  Oh, maybe he is.  It's crazy.  To me, he's not, but.  I don't even know what the hell he is.  I think he's a Jew.  Some kind of Jewish.  Probably some kind of Jew.  But maybe.  He looks a little Greek.  Yeah.  Not like American, like Trace.  Trace is obviously American.  Trace looks American.  Penn's like a Greek Jew. 
[02:40:30]  He looks like a Greek Spanish Jew.  His ice cream is made out of pennies and weather control.  Going back to that commercial, it is being shown all over America, and he has cardboard  cutouts in the stores.  Uh-huh.  Oh.  So as you're buying your bulldozer, there's a cardboard cutout.  Trace Adkins.  You need to take a picture with him?  Yes.  And again, everybody goes to Vegas, and you can't go to Vegas without seeing Penn on the  side of a building.  That's true.  You know, look, I'm pulling for Penn. 
[02:41:00]  Oh, God.  More info on Trace Adkins.  Oh, no.  He's a man's man.  Did he save fucking ten children from a burning house?  Go ahead, Pete in Tennessee.  Pete.  Pete.  Yeah, last year his house burned to the ground.  Oh.  So now he's got the sympathy of that.  What happened?  I don't know.  He was away doing a concert, I think, in Vegas, and flew home, house burned to the ground.  You know, at least we survived.  Everyone's all right.  No one got hurt.  I want to thank the firemen, the brave firemen that came to put the fire out. 
[02:41:30]  But look, he had a safety plan in place that saved his kids.  His kids and wife.  Trace Adkins loses house in fire, but safety plan saves kids.  Oh, this guy's a miracle.  He's very thoughtful.  So all he's got to do when he's up there, if he sees Donald going like, well, Penn, you  did raise the most money.  I was shot by my wife.  You know, I know when I was shot.  When I was shot.  I know when my house burned down.  I'm going to choose who wins this year. 
[02:42:00]  Oh, well, did I tell you my house burnt down?  Ouch.  It was a big fire.  My bullet wound is hurting me.  Yeah.  Oh, thank God I put a safety plan in place for my children and my wife.  Can we push play on that?  It's a video.  Yeah, let's see what the video is here.  Yeah.  Trace in his house.  We were just hanging out.  The girls were watching TV.  I was in the office messing around on the computer and we heard this incredibly loud like bang  explosion and it sounded like glass breaking and stuff. 
[02:42:30]  I mean, it was just crazy noise.  Flames flickered through a dark cloud, smoke nearly swallowing up firefighters.  Neighbors peeking through the trees to see the blaze.  The home of country music superstar Trace Adkins on fire.  And I ran from the office across the house to the garage.  The nanny?  In the garage door, there's like a big window.  She's fuckable.  You can see into the garage and all I could see were just flames and smoke.  Nanny Lindsay Weaver runs with the girls, including two of Adkins' daughters, outside  to a meeting place before calling Adkins' wife, Rhonda. 
[02:43:00]  And we were just three minutes from here.  We looked up in the sky.  We saw the black smoke.  I started driving here as fast as I could.  I put on the flashers and I just started passing people, going as fast as I could.  I even passed a cop.  He was like, follow me.  I'm like, what are you doing?  My house is on fire.  Inside the house, now a total loss are show clothes, Civil War weapons, awards, and most  important to Rhonda Adkins, family pictures.  That's what I've lost. 
[02:43:30]  I didn't back up all that stuff.  I backed up a lot of it, but not all of it.  And you hear people say this all the time.  Take the time and copy your photos.  But in the midst of neighbors and friends looking down the street at a home submerged  in smoke, the Adkins family says they're amazed everyone's okay.  Everybody got out.  No one's hurt.  My house is completely gone.  But at the end of the day, it's okay.  Yeah.  Oh, brother.  If you have kids, I guess, like when you realize your kids are alive, what else, you know? 
[02:44:00]  Can I, can I, we have more info on Trace Adkins.  Oh, okay.  Let's, unless he started that fire, Penn's in trouble.  And I want Sam to back all this shit up.  I don't want, I don't want any of these fuckers sneaking one past us today, Sam.  Okay.  All right.  But Greg in Jersey has another fact about Trace Adkins.  Yes.  Greg.  Hey, what's up, guys?  Hey.  Greggy.  Hey, what's up?  A couple years ago, Trace had a funky finger because he had his finger amputated in an accident 
[02:44:30]  and he had it reattached in a position so he could play his guitar.  Wait.  What's with this guy?  He has a finger.  But they didn't put it back normally because that would fuck up his guitar playing, so they  put it back in a weird way so he could play guitar.  Oh, God.  What was the accident?  Hold on, hold on.  Hold on.  I just found another fact while I was looking for the finger thing.  All right, but can we do the finger thing first or no?  I'm going to confirm the finger thing.  Okay.  But you want to add the other fact? 
[02:45:00]  Let me add a little known fact.  Okay.  About singer Trace Adkins.  Yes.  Is that his debut album, Dreamin' Out Loud, was dedicated to his brother Scott.  Scott was 21 years old when he was killed in a truck accident.  Oh, Jesus!  Christ.  His brother was killed in a truck accident.  This is just an all-American way to die.  Now, what about his finger?  Yeah, a little known fact about country singer Trace Adkins is that his left little finger was cut off in a work accident. 
[02:45:30]  Just a workin' Joe.  Doctors reattached it, but his finger is permanently bent at an angle.  Because of this, Trace can't play many chords on a guitar anymore.  When he does play, when he does play, he does the best that he can.  He's just doing the best he can with a missing finger and shot through the heart.  Jesus!  He says he would love to learn the piano, but he realizes his deformed finger makes that an impossibility. 
[02:46:00]  There you go, guys.  I gotta go.  Thank you.  Who has Penn's number?  Penn.  I don't think he realizes.  He's in a lot of trouble.  He should just skate today.  He shouldn't try at all.  No, forget the ice cream.  It's not worth it.  Fuck that he has the greatest ice cream.  Doesn't matter.  You gotta go out and buy a pen ice cream.  Wait, can you make a...  You know we're all about having a nice list on the show, Sam?  Yeah.  I'm losing track.  Yeah, what the fuck?  You're losing track of how great this guy is.  Do you think we like lists on this show? 
[02:46:30]  Yes, I love a good list.  Maybe we...  Can we do a side-by-side list?  What do we know about Penn Jillette?  We can figure this out.  Penn's had some tragedy, though.  The mother, father, and sister have died.  His mom made it to 95, I think.  Yeah, I know, but it's never easy.  Let's make the list.  Oh, man.  Okay, I'm making the list.  Trace Adkins is...  You start with Trace Adkins has deformed finger.  Penn Jillette has masterful use of his hands. 
[02:47:00]  I got another Trace Adkins fact coming in.  Oh, what do you got?  It just doesn't end.  Chris in Colorado.  Chris.  Hey, Trace is also a spokesman for the Wounded Warrior Project.  Yes, I've heard those.  One of the top charities.  And Penn wants to sue the army every time an IED is destroyed.  Oh, shit.  That's not looking good for Penn. 
[02:47:30]  Yeah.  Oh, my God.  Oh, Trace brought up a soldier in a wheelchair at the Academy of Country Music Award.  What?  A soldier in a wheelchair.  It was supposed to be about him that night.  He decided...  He's got no legs.  ...by an organization called the Wounded Warrior Project.  Tonight, the Academy of Country Music's charity, Lifting Lives, Trace Adkins, and the West Point Glee Club are helping people like me through the performance you're about to see.  As you listen to this song, please consider that it's not about the war. 
[02:48:00]  It's about the warrior.  Oh.  And now Trace gets out and...  It's a great charity.  Yeah.  Oh, it's playing fuck.  Woo!  Now he's gonna sing something real nice.  I was there in the winter of 64.  Oh, Vietnam.  What?  When we camped in the ice at Nashville.  Nashville.  This fucker really has a good voice. 
[02:48:30]  Jesus.  Oh, 1864.  Before that put in ski.  Okay.  When we called a treat, it was almost dark.  I died with a grape shot in my heart. 
[02:49:00]  Almost dead when his wife shot him.  Say a prayer for peace.  Oh, it's the Say a Prayer for Peace commercial.  What a good song.  By the way, he was an oil rig worker before he was a country singer.  Really?  Yeah.  Of course he was doing man's work.  A wild cat?  What do they call him?  And we have more facts coming in.  A roughneck?  Brian in Pittsburgh.  Brian.  How you doing?  Hey.  Hey, I was a couple years ago down in Nashville at the Country Music Fest, and he was performing 
[02:49:30]  along with a lot of other people, and this was right after his house had burned down.  Apparently there were a lot of charities that popped up online, people putting together,  donating money to him and his family to help rebuild and all that stuff.  He announced at that concert that, A, he was taking all that money and donating it because  he flat out said, hey guys, I don't need it.  Help out people that need the help, and asked anybody that donated money at that concert  to give it to the homeless and stuff like that.  Oh, my.  Yeah. 
[02:50:00]  I love Penn, but he's kind of fucked.  He's kind of fucked on this one.  That's why Penn was focusing on his ice cream.  Is there any scandal in Trace's life?  That song was great, wasn't it?  Oh, see.  Is that his song?  Prayer for Pete.  We'll play it.  It is one of his, like, hits.  Oh, he wrote that.  This list is not, this side-by-side is not looking good.  I know.  No.  This is the guy who created the song, Honky Tonk Badonkadonk.  That's Trace Atkins.  Yeah, what song is that?  Oh, yeah.  Honky Tonk. 
[02:50:30]  Honky Tonk Badonkadonk.  He knows to have fun, too.  We went over this song with Patrice, didn't we?  Yes, we did.  Yes.  Honky Tonk.  Honky Tonk.  Honky Tonk.  Honky Tonk.  Honky Tonk.  Honky Tonk.  Honky Tonk.  Honky Tonk.  Honky Tonk.  Honky Tonk.  Honky Tonk.  Honky Tonk.  Honky Tonk.  Honky Tonk.  That's a terrible song.  Oh, it's awesome. 
[02:51:00]  It's a huge hit.  Oh, wow.  All right, are we done with the list?  Do you want me to go?  I have a list for Penn and a list for Trace.  I want to read the Trace list first.  All right.  All right, that's fair enough.  Okay.  And you tell me who you think...  Supposedly, he's like the underdog.  Tell me who you think is going to win Celebrity Oppressions.  Sure.  This is Trace Atkins.  Okay.  He was shot in the heart, but didn't press charges against his ex-wife for doing it.  Okay.  His house burned down, but his kids survived because they had a fire plan. 
[02:51:30]  He helped the Wounded Warriors Project.  He sells bulldozers.  His finger's been amputated, but he keeps trying.  He has a wonderful voice.  He's selling ice cream for the Red Cross.  He used to be an oil rig worker.  He gave money given to him for a new house to charity.  He has billionaire friends, and he's not afraid to have a little fun.  Did you get his dead brother in there?  Yeah, what about the dead brothers?  Oh, fuck.  I forget.  Sam, how do you forget that one?  I'm also hearing about a car accident. 
[02:52:00]  I found a site here that talks about country music, and it just lists a couple of Trace's  injuries.  Yeah.  This one says here, in 1982, a bulldozer accident resulted in deep cuts to Trace's hindquarters.  He thought he was fixin' to lose both his legs.  Fixin'.  It has a quote below his legs, yeah.  And then he was in an oil tank explosion in 1983.  While he was trying to repair a leak, crushing his left leg. 
[02:52:30]  Damn!  What was Penn thinking?  This guy's like the Terminator.  Oh, no, on Twitter it's comin' in.  Little known fact, Trace Adkins donated both kidneys to a kitten with leukemia.  What a guy.  Anyway, I added, his brother died when he was 21, so Trace dedicated his first album  to him.  Yeah.  What was that song you were singing that I really liked?  Honky Tonk Badonkadonk?  No!  Say a Prayer for Peace.  I can't find that on iTunes.  Two people were killed in a collision with his tour bus. 
[02:53:00]  Oh, my God.  And then he was in an accident as a teenager.  What?  Come on!  This guy's just all tragedy.  Let's say hi to Jason in Detroit.  Are you just fuckin' with us?  No, I actually looked it up on Wikipedia, so I do want to take that as a source.  Okay.  He was driving his 1955 pickup truck as a teenager, and he hit a bus head-on, broke both his legs  and his arm.  He survives a head-on collision with a bus?  They really... 
[02:53:30]  God wants those legs of his, but he ain't giving them up that easy.  No, he's not.  Should we go to Wikipedia before we finalize the list?  Yes, Iraq.  When you were talking about his finger being cut, I'm trying to remember, did you explain  what he was doing and how he did it?  No, I don't think so.  All right.  This says,  In 1989, he nearly cut off his finger, trying to open a can of pipe dope with a six-inch  buck knife.  Oh!  Ow!  Wow.  Wow.  Oh, that'll hurt.  Is that what somebody says when they want you to hand them a pipe? 
[02:54:00]  Pipe?  Oh, my God.  Oh.  Do you have the Pendulet list all set?  Just trying to help.  Yeah, I have the Pendulet list.  All right.  You guys ready for the Pendulet list?  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Okay.  Enough about Trace Adkins.  All right.  The Pendulet list.  Here's the Pendulet list.  Okay. 
[02:54:30]  His parents are dead.  He might be a Jew.  Ah.  That's all we know.  That's all we really know about why he would, you know, get votes.  Of course he would put sea salt in his ice cream.  He better.  He was desperate.  He was real desperate.  And Trace knew.  Trace knows he has it, so he's, like, throwing a bone to maple.  Yeah.  He's like, there's not enough macadamia nut awareness.  Right.  He knows people don't fucking give a shit about maple.  He's trying to help out the maple people.  Yeah, yeah.  I'm helping the maple industry. 
[02:55:00]  Right.  Because I already know I got this in the bag.  Hi, I'm Trace Adkins for the American Maple Association.  Yeah.  Let's play some Trace Adkins in the break.  You want to play the one we started?  Someone was saying we should play Arlington?  We'll do Honky Tonk, Badonka Donk.  Arlington.  Oh, boy.  Honky Donk, Badonka Donk.  I don't know what that means.  It's a Honky Tonk, Badonka Donk.  Wait, wait, wait.  You like that?  No.  It's terrible.  Bruce has something on Pendulet. 
[02:55:30]  Hi, Bruce.  I mean, we've got to be fair.  We're trying to build the Pendulet list.  Yes, Bruce.  Hey, boys.  Hey.  Calling from the highway in Maryland.  Good for you.  And I got something on Pendulet's side of the list.  Yeah.  Well, a few years ago on a television show, they did a walkthrough of Pendulet's home,  and he's got his own personal sex dungeon.  Oh, God.  You know what?  Add it to the list, Sam.  You never know what America's into. 
[02:56:00]  Trace is how it's burned down.  That's not good.  And Pendulet has a sex dungeon.  Middle America will not appreciate.  He plays in a jazz trio.  Oh, jazz.  Oh, God, I know.  That's right.  He does.  Before he shows.  He plays the stand-up bass.  He warms up his own fucking show with a three-piece.  Yep.  Let's say hi to Ron in Wisconsin.  Ron.  Yeah, you need to listen to the song Arlington.  It's a real support for the troops and the tearjerker.  Check that out.  Like a good dickjerker. 
[02:56:30]  Did we go with Arlington or the one we were playing?  Let's try Arlington.  No, not that one, Sam.  Let's try Arlington going into break.  Fuck it.  You got that, Iraq.  Yeah, I have that one.  Do you want me to give you the updated Pendulet list?  Yes, please, Sam.  He might be a Jew.  His parents are dead.  He has a sex dungeon.  Yes.  He's sunk.  He is so sunk.  Where can we bet on this?  This is an easy win.  Yeah.  He might be a Jew.  He might be a Jew.  And I believe we're friends with Pendulet, officially.  Oh, yeah. 
[02:57:00]  But we have to bet against him.  He was very nice to my sister, Dawny.  And he remembered.  Yes.  We want Pendulet to win.  We do.  We're just looking at the facts.  Uh-huh.  You know, the one thing we've got to add to the Pendulet list, that certainly is not going  to help him.  He's an outspoken atheist.  He thinks God's a queer.  Oh, my God.  He's so done.  Trace Atkins is all about, you know, God and country.  God and country.  And here's an atheist with a sex dungeon. 
[02:57:30]  Do you want it?  God damn it.  I don't think nail polish, whatever the reason may be, is he's going to help him.  He wears nail polish on his pinky.  That's not going to help him.  Let's add that to the list.  Ring finger.  Which finger is it?  Ring finger.  Ring finger.  As far as mom, though, that's a cool thing.  I know, but they don't know that.  People don't know it.  They just see some fruity Jew with a fucking...  Yeah, sex dungeon.  Dressing up like a girl.  A six-foot-eight Jew with a nail polish on one finger.  I don't even know what Penn is. 
[02:58:00]  I assume...  He's a Jew, obviously.  I don't know if he's Jewish.  No, he's atheist.  He couldn't be Jewish.  Yeah, I don't know what he was born.  I forgot.  I'm quite sure he was not born Jewish.  Might be a Jew.  Should we change it to might be a Jew, just to be fair?  No, that's what the list is.  He might be a Jew.  Might be.  He's just...  This is what the American public sees.  Yes.  Yes.  And the American public is thinking that he's probably a Jew.  Probably.  All right, let's do the final list.  Okay. 
[02:58:30]  Go with Trace Adkins first.  Trace Adkins.  Uh-huh.  He was shot in the heart, but he didn't press charges against his ex-wife who shot him.  Does anyone else understand how fucking cool that is?  That's crazy.  His house burned down.  Right.  But his kids survived because they had a fire plan.  Yeah.  He helps the Wounded Warrior Project.  Mm-hmm.  He sells bulldozers.  Yeah, it's American.  His finger's been amputated, but he keeps trying.  He has a wonderful voice.  He does.  He's selling ice cream for the American Red Cross. 
[02:59:00]  That's nice.  He used to be an oil rig worker.  Mm-hmm.  Don't forget about the explosion.  He gave...  Oh, what was...  Survived in...  In 1983.  Yeah.  He survived an oil tank explosion while trying to repair a leak.  Don't forget to put that in.  Yeah.  Who survives an oil tank?  And how did he hurt his finger, Yurok?  I don't know.  We'll have to listen later.  Okay, I have something for Penn's list, too. 
[02:59:30]  You have something for Penn's list.  Penn doesn't drink.  He's not a beer drinker.  That's not good.  America respects that, right?  Love a good drinker.  Holy fuck.  Okay, he used to be an oil rig worker.  He survived an oil rig explosion in 1983.  He gave money given to him for a new house to charity.  Right.  He has billionaire friends.  Right.  He's not afraid to have a little fun.  Right.  And his brother died when his brother was 21. 
[03:00:00]  Oh, man.  And so Trace dedicated his first album to him.  You forgot about the head-on collision with a bus.  Head-on collision.  Head-on collision.  As a teenager.  With a bus, as a teen.  Teen.  Teen.  Teen.  Teen.  And what about the thing with his legs?  I thought some of that stuff started to get undocumented.  The bulldozer almost taking his ass cheeks off?  Right.  Oh, right.  Yeah, it was his ass cheeks, especially, right?  Yeah.  Unofficially, because I don't think we have any proof of that.  But I will add that.  When he was a teen, he was in a head-on collision with a bus. 
[03:00:30]  Yeah.  Oh, no.  Right here.  Fact coming in.  Yeah.  Trace Adkins is actually the Navy SEAL who killed Bin Laden.  Oh, man.  Who knew that?  All right, and then do you want to hear the Penn final list?  Yes, please.  Okay.  The final list for Penn.  He might be a Jew.  His parents are dead.  He has a sex dungeon.  And he's an outspoken atheist who wears nail polish.  Oh, gosh.  The country is not going to take care of it. 
[03:01:00]  Middle America does not fucking relate to this.  No.  Hold on.  I am trying to move on here, but there's an actual website.  Oh.  Yeah, it's real.  Okay.  13 country artists with bad luck, and one of them is Trace Adkins.  It's one through nine.  It's on a website called tasteofcountry.com, and then you'll get to the Trace Adkins, I guess.  I want to thank QuickRNU on Twitter for sending us this.  There it is.  What does it say? 
[03:01:30]  All right.  There might be some more nuggets in here.  There actually are a couple more nuggets.  Okay.  Trace Adkins has been shot by his wife.  Okay.  He had his pinky finger cut off.  Had his nose ripped off in a car accident.  It was sewn back on.  We didn't hear about that.  Had his house burned down.  His nose was ripped off?  Yeah.  Hoo-hoo.  And been involved.  So was mine by Pinocchio, Robin.  Get it?  I have a big nose.  Yeah.  And been involved in multiple tractor accidents. 
[03:02:00]  Multiple.  Who gets in one tractor accident?  Who gets back in a tractor after being in a tractor accident?  Okay.  I got to add the nose thing.  Yeah.  His nose was ripped off.  You don't leave out having your nose ripped off.  How do you keep a fish from smelling?  How?  Cough his nose.  It's not funny, Chip.  It's a terrible old joke that children tell. 
[03:02:30]  Let's play Arlington and it's a break.  It's about the Arlington Cemetery by Trace Adkins.  It's not a good joke.  No.  I think we made our point here today.  Trace Adkins sings songs about the Arlington Cemetery.  Right.  And Penn Jillette does the bullet trick.  Yeah.  Yeah, but the bullet trick is very impressive.  It's impressive.  It is impressive.  It's not exactly a tearjerker.  Trace Adkins never fucking took a picture of my sister.  He had his nose ripped off.  True. 
[03:03:00]  Oh, that's, you know.  Isn't it true?  Penn was in a Run DMC video?  That's not bad.  Yeah.  The middle of the market was like that.  Oh, they love that.  The interaction with the blacks.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  Fucking shit.  What a downer chip is.  Oh, my God.  Penn's creepy.  I didn't know this about Penn.  Rick in El Paso.  Rick. 
[03:03:30]  Hey, Rick.  Yeah.  Hey.  Yeah, Penn actually owns a piece of flesh with a tattoo on it that was taken from the  stabber of a murder, a murder after his execution.  What?  Jesus.  What?  It's Frank.  He's got a piece.  He's got a tattoo.  He's got a piece of flesh that has a tattoo on it from a murderer after his execution.  It was basically flayed off him and put in a frame.  Why did he want that?  He didn't get that.  Well, he just fucking Penn Jillette.  Come on.  He's a fucking freaky dude.  But was it a famous murderer? 
[03:04:00]  I'm not sure.  During the interview, he wasn't even sure he was supposed to have it.  But he, you know, he said, look, look what I got.  Yeah, it doesn't sound like something you should be allowed to have.  Right, right.  All right.  We could add it to the list, though.  That's for sure.  Oh, wow.  That's not good for him.  Yes.  I even know the case of the killer, actually.  It was a murderer.  Too far to over here.  No.  But it was a very famous serial killer.  Yeah.  Who was it?  His name was the Jocularity Killer.  He would laugh. 
[03:04:30]  O.J.  Killed his victims.  All right.  We're done.  Trace Atkins.  Not done with the show.  Done with this, I guess.  Yeah.  Good luck to you.  I hope people vote for Penn Jillette.  There's no voting.  Oh, yeah.  That's true.  He buys fucking ice cream.  He needs all the help he can get.  He's got a sex dungeon.  True.  Yeah, me too.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, it is worse.  More of Opie and Anthony's worst in 2013 so far. 
[03:05:00]  Coming up.  Opie and Anthony's worst in 2013 so far.  Continues.  Right now.  Right now.  Right now.  Yes, sir.  Worst of 2013 so far while Opie and Anthony are on vacation.  I, Sam Roberts, will spend the week bringing you the best moments the Opie and Anthony show  has had this year.  Now, we've been following the Penn Jillette, Trace Atkins thing going on.  We were able to have Trace Atkins in studio after we had Penn.  After we broke down what the two were doing and who was really more likely to win. 
[03:05:30]  Trace Atkins stopped by.  And you know what?  Penn Jillette is a friend of the Opie and Anthony show.  But when you look at a guy like Trace Atkins, and when you have a great time with a guy  like Trace Atkins, it makes it goddamn hard to stay loyal.  Trace Atkins, judge for yourself on the worst of 2013 so far.  Opie and Anthony's worst in 2013 so far.  On the Opie and Anthony channel.  Trace Atkins.  Here comes the Magnolia Bakery treats.  Those are delightful.  Yes.  That's not Trace Atkins.  No.  Is that the wife that shot him? 
[03:06:00]  That was like a panda.  Should we not bring that up?  Oh, god damn.  Yeah, right.  Hi, I'm Trace Atkins.  There he is.  Trace.  Trace Atkins.  Take a seat over here.  Pull up a mic.  We're on the air live.  We just do this.  Look at the voice.  They told me y'all were, so.  Oh, yeah?  God damn, Trace Atkins.  Let me tell you something.  We're really good.  He's got mitts on him, too.  I know.  Do you know Colin Quinn?  Stop holding my hand, Quinn.  How you doing?  Good to see you. 
[03:06:30]  Back in the day.  You guys know each other?  No.  No, but I'm a fan.  I'm a fan of Colin Quinn.  And Tom Popper to your right.  Hey, Trace.  He's good friends with Jerry Seinfeld.  That's his claim.  No, I mean.  He's acting with Michael Douglas in a new movie.  The Liberace movie.  The Liberace movie.  Oh, yeah.  Really?  I'll brag for my pal Tom Popper.  Thank you.  Do you want to see Trace or any of his buddies down there  who are going to go see that Liberace movie?  Hell no.  Hells no.  I'm probably not. 
[03:07:00]  Trace, we had a pendulet in here yesterday.  Oh, yeah?  And he was pitching his ice cream.  You know, Apprentice, a celebrity, all-star, friggin' amazing Apprentice this season.  You guys are head-to-head now.  Yeah.  So, now the object is to sell this ice cream.  Yes.  At this point.  Right.  How do you feel you're doing?  I'm doing great.  I got a little pint of Penn's ice cream yesterday.  I found a booger right on the top.  Oh, shit.  It was a booger right on the top.  Oh, shit. 
[03:07:30]  It was a booger on the top of it.  So, his ice cream has boogers in it, I'm just telling you.  That could be detrimental to ice cream sales.  At least I tried to disguise mine with macadamia nuts.  So, if something falls in there during production, people think it's a macadamia.  Right.  I got you.  Good strategy.  But his just has boogers.  But we got to explain to Trace, we're really good friends with Penn Jillette.  He does the show a lot.  But then we kind of started looking into your history, and we're all in.  We're hoping you win this thing.  We're like Penn is sunk.  Because your back story is way better than Penn Jillette's. 
[03:08:00]  Absolutely.  As far as country artists go, you fit that bill that everyone has stereotyped over the  years of taking tragedy and turning it around, pulling yourself up by the proverbial bootstraps,  as they say.  Well, I suppose so.  That's why I think I've written one positive love song in my life.  And I was commissioned to write that one.  And I think that's about it. 
[03:08:30]  Now, you came up as a working guy.  You worked in oil field.  I worked in oil field for 10 years.  Oil field.  I worked offshore on a drilling rig for six years, roughneck, worked derrick.  Jesus.  Wow.  That's a real job.  That's how I cut my finger off.  Yeah, yeah.  Apparently, we read you cut your finger off.  Yeah, I cut that one off.  It was then right off.  It's permanently at 90 degree angle.  They put it back on.  They put it back on.  But it's bent like that.  The doctor asked me.  He said, it's not going to work anymore.  I think I can save it.  But how do you want it?  Do you want it straight? 
[03:09:00]  And I said, no.  I said, put it in a sus position.  So now you can play.  I said, at least I can suspend a D or a G.  I said, put it in a sus position.  He went, excuse me?  I showed him with my other hand.  I said, dude, like that.  That's having some forethought.  Wow.  Well, dude, no.  Not really.  Because, I mean, the second that I cut it, that was the first thing I thought.  Well, there goes my guitar playing.  You know, I was pretty much over at that point.  Wow.  There's no way he's seeing Liberace.  No.  Wait, you worked in those oil rigs like off the coast and stuff? 
[03:09:30]  Yeah.  Wow.  That's where the offshore ones are, Carl.  Jesus Christ.  Yeah.  Oh, no.  I hung out to dry there.  I'm sorry, Colin.  I didn't mean to.  Damn.  I told Colin I'd be nice to him when another guest was in.  And by the way, as Bobby Kelly pointed out to me, it was always funny to me when it  was Voss or Bobby Kelly.  Then it was me.  Then I was like, oh, this is not funny at all.  That's true.  Man, that thing you and Seinfeld did a while back was brilliant.  Oh, thanks.  Damn.  That was absolutely brilliant. 
[03:10:00]  The one-man show?  That was brilliant.  He's got a new one that we saw last night.  That was great.  Great.  I'll bust it out.  I want to.  That's great.  I'm all over it.  I'm in.  He does do a great day.  What are your...  Barrow Street Theater.  What are your...  I could probably guess, but your political affiliations as far as things that are going  on the news these days, what I say is the dismantling of the Constitution.  Do you get involved in much of that?  Well, I don't get involved in it.  You know, I don't...  And people know that, too.  They come to my shows, and they're not going to get beat over the head with any kind of... 
[03:10:30]  That's good.  I don't do that, and I never have.  And you know what?  And I don't like people that do.  But at least, you know, some of the ones that do it, they're right up front with it, and  you know that going in, that you're going to get that.  I don't like to be ambushed by somebody.  Right, right, right.  Well, but anyway, I'm a pretty conservative guy, sure, you know, and what's going on right  now, you know, I believe that when the government starts using agencies to persecute people  that they have political and philosophical differences with, that's tyranny, my friend.  Thank you. 
[03:11:00]  Absolutely.  God damn, I got to agree.  And with that fucking voice saying it like that?  Yep.  Yeah.  That means business.  It makes you believe.  I agree.  No kidding.  God, it's so nice.  It's so refreshing to see somebody in the business that we call show.  Right.  Well, I'm sure you heard something similar to that from Penn yesterday.  Well, yeah, yeah, a little bit.  Penn, again, also doesn't really put himself out there politically that much.  Yeah, he is a libertarian.  And an atheist.  He's sort of a libertarian.  Yeah, yeah.  He's a quasi-libertarian. 
[03:11:30]  Quasi-libertarian's just a Republican who smokes dope.  That's true.  That's really true.  Do you go shooting and stuff?  Yeah, if there's something neat shooting.  No, very good, yeah.  I mean, I enjoy a little gunfire, but I go to the range, you know.  There's not much going on.  Well, I do appreciate my Second Amendment right.  I've got a lot of guns.  I've got a lot of guns.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  You don't have as many goods as he does.  I've got a lot.  It's very difficult in New York, too. 
[03:12:00]  He's got your B-trace.  Well, I don't have a Predator drone.  I want one of those.  He's got one.  I want a drone, man.  Well, I've got a pretty big one with cameras on it and stuff.  I could send it up autonomously to patrol the neighborhood.  Awesome, awesome.  That's great.  I monitored some people getting a pizza delivery the other day.  It was a very exciting, very compelling video I got from that one.  But, no, I really do.  And in New York, it's very difficult, as you probably know, to even say that you own guns.  But, no, I love it. 
[03:12:30]  I picked up a Barrett .50 cal.  Man, they make those just right down the road from where I live in Murfreesboro, Tennessee.  Oh, isn't that fantastic?  Yeah.  You ever fire one of those?  I have.  A lot of fun.  I don't have one yet.  I'm about to get one.  I just got a Desert Eagle .50 caliber.  I got one of those.  Oh, wow.  What a treat.  You take that down to the indoor range and fire.  They won't.  At my indoor range, they won't let me shoot it.  They won't?  No.  Over here in Nessau, they let me.  But, you watch everybody from all the other slots.  They peek their head around like, what the hell?  Right, yeah.  Somebody's got a cannon. 
[03:13:00]  Is he firing that?  You know what?  What is it exactly?  It's a .50 caliber pistol.  Yeah.  It's the Arnold Schwarzenegger one from that.  Yeah.  The guy that I got it from, you know, he said, dude, don't ever shoot anybody in your  house with this.  It's not the most practical gun.  Wait until they go outside.  It's going to ruin everything.  Because it will make a mess.  It's not the most practical gun to have, but it is a lot of fun.  I'm not worried about the killing. 
[03:13:30]  I'm worried about the cleanup.  The mess.  You shoot a melon with that thing, and it just explodes.  It's fantastic.  It's fun to shoot.  Yeah, it is.  Is it heavy?  Yeah, it's heavy.  Very.  You put a full magazine in there, because the shells are really, really big.  You could bludgeon.  So you could do some damage with just beating someone.  You don't have to shoot anybody.  You don't have to shoot the damn thing.  We've got to ask you, man.  Speaking of shooting, what we learned about you yesterday, you got shot in the heart. 
[03:14:00]  Yeah.  Jesus.  Holy fuck.  How'd that happen?  The story is insane.  Really mad woman.  Yeah.  Really?  Yeah.  You know, and she had the pistol, and it was, I learned a very good life lesson from that.  I held my hand out like this, and I said, give me that pistol, or I'm going to take it  away from you and beat your goddamn brains out with it.  Oh.  And she stuck it under my arm and pulled the trigger.  Oh, man.  The bullet went in here and came out here. 
[03:14:30]  Wow.  I mean, it went straight across the chest cavity.  Went through both of my lungs.  Went through my heart.  Did you think that was it?  Was it right in your chest?  You know, when something like that happens, you just, you know, you don't think.  You know, I just remember thinking that it was brand new Berber carpet, and I thought,  if I bleed on this carpet, she's going to shoot me again.  Holy Christ.  So I went to a room that had tile floor and laid down there to die.  It's amazing what you think.  Oh, my God.  Wow.  How close were you to dying?  Huh?  How close were you? 
[03:15:00]  I don't know.  You know, they life-flighted me to the trauma center at Vanderbilt University Medical Center,  and they saved my life.  Yeah.  It was, had it not been for that trauma center there, I wouldn't be here.  Did she call 911?  She did.  She did.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah, she did.  That's, and he never pressed charges.  Well, I got a good, clean divorce out of the deal.  Wow.  You know, now we understand.  After my divorce, I would rather have been shot, I think.  It would have been less painful. 
[03:15:30]  Now we understand.  Financially viable.  Because we're like, how do you not press charges?  Well, he answered that question.  That is a good.  It was cheaper.  That's a good chip to bring into the courtroom with you.  Oh, yeah.  And by the way.  Right.  Let's not forget.  Yeah.  Wow.  No, no, it didn't go to court.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Wow.  That is something.  You must have really pissed her off.  Yeah, yeah, I did.  I really did.  Tom's taking her side.  I love it.  No, no, no. 
[03:16:00]  That's what you do.  You know what, man?  My body is covered with scars, and I deserved every one of them.  Every one of them, huh?  I'm not going to sit here and try to say anything.  An oil rig accident is rarely just, hey, someone got a Band-Aid over there.  It usually ends up being pretty.  Yeah, I got a scar here.  You know, I busted my ribs, and, you know, my elbows, I've had to operate on this, because  I was jacking the pipe in the derrick, you know, and I wore my elbows out, so I'm all 
[03:16:30]  used up, but, you know.  Was that good money at the time?  Yeah.  Yeah?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Better than what I make now.  I make hundreds of dollars a year now.  Fuck, man.  Oh, damn.  Were you playing music the whole time you were out there, or did that come out later?  No, yeah, I was playing guitar and trying to write stuff when I was out there.  Yeah, I started.  My old man got me guitar when I was 10.  I don't really know why he did it.  He didn't play.  So that's when I started. 
[03:17:00]  Oh, wow.  And what was the big break there that got you off the rig?  My second wife wanted to move far away from my first wife, because they didn't get along  at all.  Yeah.  So we moved, and she said, let's move.  I can't stand her.  And I was like, okay, well, I don't really like her that much either.  Where do you want to go?  And I said, let's just go to Nashville.  I said, you know, I like to sing and play, and maybe I can make something happen. 
[03:17:30]  Were you knocking around the clubs over there in Nashville?  Yeah, I played clubs there for about three years.  You got a lot of bars.  I was working construction and playing.  You got to have a day gig in Nashville, too.  Yeah, yeah.  And you just kind of played clubs the same way until someone notices.  Yeah, I played the club circuit in Texas for about five years.  In the southwest, Texas, New Mexico, Oklahoma.  I played that circuit for five years.  Did you enjoy it?  In the late 80s.  Was it fun?  Yeah, I did.  I really did enjoy it. 
[03:18:00]  And then it finally got to a point where I faced myself in the mirror one morning and said, you know what?  Five years ago, I wouldn't even have hung out with somebody like you because I'd gotten really strung out.  And, you know, I had to get away from it, go back to the oil field to save my life.  Wow, really?  Wow.  Damn.  That's partying.  That's some perspective.  That's what strung out means.  Yeah.  For you from the Liberace movie.  Which one of you Nancys doesn't like maple in my ice cream anyway?  Oh, boy, I don't know. 
[03:18:30]  Who said that?  Sam, was that you?  Oh, Sam, saying he doesn't like maple.  Yeah, I don't know who said that, Trace.  That would be crazy to say in front of you.  We just assumed with everything you have going on in your life, you were probably head of the maple producers coalition or something.  Hey, let me write that down.  Yeah, write that down.  We're all big fans of maple.  Right in.  Yeah, yeah.  This is where it starts.  Now stop.  Trace, you're an oil rig guy, a badass, a ball fighter. 
[03:19:00]  How the hell did you end up with maple macadamia mashup?  We're putting a stop to it today.  Okay.  We're putting a stop to it.  All right.  Let me tell you where I'm at in my life right now, man.  Yes.  I have prostitutes coming up to me going, dude, the shit you're doing for money is just, you know, how can you live with yourself?  And I don't disagree.  I have no pride anymore.  You know what, though?  I'm just like Quinn. 
[03:19:30]  We sold our dignity a long time ago.  And I sold mine cheap.  I don't know about it.  I got to say, though, the All-Star Apprentice ice cream here from Trace, the maple macadamia mashup, proceeds go into the Red Cross, the American Red Cross.  Right.  See, that's pretty goddamn good right there.  You can't totally say you're sold out.  And then also your Wounded Warrior project work is amazing.  Well, that's been a privilege.  Absolutely, right?  You know, the association with them has just been something that has just been a humbling experience for me. 
[03:20:00]  I've been doing that for a few years now.  Just a great organization.  We hope you win Celebrity Apprentice.  I do, too.  You just told Penn that yesterday.  No, no.  I don't even know.  No, I said it after we looked at his backstory that we have to go with this guy.  I did say that.  I changed my opinion, even though he's a really good friend of ours.  But how do you not root for a guy like this?  Penn's a really good friend of mine, too.  Yeah, but Penn has a sex dungeon.  That's all he's got going for him. 
[03:20:30]  How is the Midwest going to appreciate a magician with a sex dungeon?  We're going all American with this one.  I don't know what bars they go to when you work on the oil rigs.  Don't you guys have, like, a group of bars you go and you get into a little flack with the local...  Didn't you see Armageddon?  What's wrong with you?  No, of course they do.  You didn't see Armageddon?  No.  A bunch of roughnecks out there in space?  I don't like those kind of movies.  Did you watch that, Trace, and just go, get out of here?  It was ridiculous.  I could have done that.  No, it was one of the most ridiculous movies.  Let's do it.  We got real oil rigs.  We got Guy Fieri outside, too, so I don't know what to do. 
[03:21:00]  Oh, Jesus.  I'll sit on the couch.  I saw him.  No.  I saw him the other day.  Oh, my God.  What are you guys doing?  Sheriff?  Colin, you can't do that.  I'm sitting right here.  That's Fieri's manager.  That's a big...  Look how big that's.  That is a big son of a bitch right there.  He might be taller than you, Trace.  He is tall.  I met him yesterday.  He's taller than me.  Here's Guy Fieri.  Guy Fieri.  Rock and roll AC-DC.  Yeah.  For those about to rock right on his fucking chest, baby.  What's up, Guy?  Yeah.  Good to see you, buddy.  You know, Trace?  I just met him the other day. 
[03:21:30]  God, is he tall?  Yeah, he's tall.  Yeah, he's tall as your manager.  Yeah, your manager's pretty goddamn tall right there.  But he's not rocking a cowboy hat and boots.  Yeah.  He's in Nikes and a golf shirt.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  No, I saw him.  We met the other day.  And what a great guy.  And you've hit the tour, man.  You've been all over.  Well, that's what they make you do when you have a new album come out.  They make you go dance for Granny.  The girls were going nuts at that show at the other day.  I can imagine.  Like, hey, I'm here.  I'm cooking.  I'm making some food.  You were cooking at one of his shows? 
[03:22:00]  I should have been cooking at one of his shows.  It would have been.  No, we were.  We were doing one of the morning shows.  Oh, okay.  It had a good time.  So we were standing out there grilling and talking about food and the whole thing.  And he's from Louisiana.  Nikes.  We were talking about Nikes.  We were talking about Nikes.  You've got to respect the guy that's got his own line of cutlery.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  We were just looking at that.  Knuckle sandwich knives.  That's all right.  What a great name.  Flames on him.  Big sharp blade.  Right, Colin?  Great name for his knives.  Yes, indeed.  Guy, do you remember when we met?  Austin, Texas. 
[03:22:30]  Really?  Colin Quinn?  Colin makes a face like, nah.  You recognize me.  Austin, Texas.  He's so proud of himself that he remembered something.  Did you see that?  That look on his face.  That was awesome.  He had a senior moment.  He's like, I remembered something.  Come on.  I know that.  Senior moment.  Magnolia bakery treats, Guy.  CQ.  Who else?  Nice.  You also switched spots for Tom Papa.  Yeah, I think Tom felt a little like, you know.  Tom should be on the couch, quite frankly.  No, I didn't. 
[03:23:00]  I was like, Colin Quinn was to be up here.  But Guy and I go way back also.  I want an expert opinion.  Tom, will you get up here, man?  I don't care if y'all tried.  I want him to try.  Yeah, exactly.  He's the expert.  Yeah, guys, try the maple.  He's the expert.  What is this called?  Moonshine mashup?  See, I tell you, if there would have been a little moonshine in this, I think these are  great.  Well, we know.  Yo, the mad Cubans in here, too.  Oh, you're an alcoholic, though.  The mad Cuban.  We love him.  Is he a character?  You were the one who introduced us to him, and now he does our show.  That's maple-y.  It has a butterscotch-y taste to it. 
[03:23:30]  It's very good.  And it's good.  And it's pretty good.  Yeah, I know.  Hope you should try something.  Shut the front door.  You know, and I just thought, you know, Penn, he did, he went way out there and mixed vanilla  and chocolate.  I did a maple macadamia, which my young lady, they called her an ice cream wizard.  She said that, as far as she knew, that hadn't been done. 
[03:24:00]  I'll tell you, I had Penn's yesterday, and he's got salt in his.  He's got a sea salt in it.  He's got a little sea salt in it.  With salt and the counterbalance to the sugar.  I mean, it really plays nicely.  And they had big chunks of chocolate in it, kind of a bittersweet chocolate.  But I'm not a huge chocolate guy.  This right here reminds me of, like, pralines and cream.  That macadamia that survives in there.  A lot of times the nuts kind of get, you know, they kind of get crushed, and they're a little  soft, and they don't have any texture.  This has great texture.  It's not overly sweet.  You think maple, and I'm like, oh boy, someone's going to go crazy with them. 
[03:24:30]  This is butter worse.  But this has got a good balance, man.  She kept coming to me, and I would say, come on, give me some more maple.  And she kept cranking up the maple intensity, and I thought I may have gone a little too  far with it.  You think it's all right?  It's almost too much.  Can you ship this to people's houses?  I mean, or can you only buy Dwayne Reed and his curses?  And Walgreens, yeah.  Is it only in New York they carry it?  No, it's everywhere.  I'm nationwide, dude.  National, right? 
[03:25:00]  Nationwide.  Hell yeah.  Nationwide.  God damn, is that a great song.  Tell us about the new album that's coming out.  I got a new album out.  It's called Love Will, and it's just nothing but love songs.  I've never done that before.  Yeah.  Love Will dot dot dot.  There you go.  Thank you, guy.  I was right there.  Guy knows.  Did you do that?  The first time I'd ever done that.  We just started playing your songs yesterday.  I didn't set out to do it, really.  I thought I had the album done in August, and then this apprentice thing came up, and 
[03:25:30]  I whored out and went and did that, so I couldn't come out in the fall with the album  like I thought I was going to, so we had to delay the release of it.  And in the meantime, I came up with a few more songs, and I recorded them, and then I realized  that I had 11 love songs.  I had about 18, 19 songs cut, and I thought, wow, 11 of these are love songs, so I'm just  going to put out an album of love songs.  But it's not like a bread album.  I mean, don't think that it's that, because you've got to keep in mind, I'm the guy that 
[03:26:00]  thinks Badonkadonk is a love song.  Right, yes.  You know, keep, yeah.  So, but I will say this, this album is a deal closer, you know, if you've got, and she's  not cooperating and spending the evening with her, put this album on, close the deal.  Sounds like Fast Times at Ridgefown.  Or let her go.  Yeah.  Must have been somebody's baby.  Yeah.  Jennifer Jason Leigh's getting plowed again. 
[03:26:30]  Every time that goddamn song came out.  It's your video.  It's your video.  It's your video.  So what, did anything change in your life where you're like, ah, love songs, let me jot  a few of these down?  No, you know, I don't, not, not consciously.  I don't, but maybe there's something going on.  You know, I think, I don't want to get all into that stuff, man, but I suppose there's  a time in a man's life when he starts staring mortality in the face and, you know, and you  start realizing.  Geez, what was that for you?  Like 10?  Based on your bio?  Holy shit. 
[03:27:00]  No, I always thought I was indestructible.  Now I kind of know that I'm not.  Yeah, that kind of sucks and shot in the heart does that to a man.  Yeah, man.  Who said that?  Oh, the couch.  Oh, my Tom.  Tom, boy, Tom.  I'm relaxing on the couch.  I can't even see him.  He's at the kid table.  I couldn't stand to see Colin Quinn after watching his show last night sitting on the  couch.  I couldn't stand to see Colin Quinn.  I can't have the legend be on the couch.  Tom, you should have seen when Mark Cuban and Bill Burr was in the air sitting on that  couch.  It was ridiculous.  You were just being pounded.  That was terrible. 
[03:27:30]  Now you're just name dropping Mark Cuban.  Wow.  If I had a fucking Desert Eagle that day, there'd be no Mark Cuban.  Oh, wow.  Damn.  Opio Bill Burr.  And, of course, Guy, Guy Fieri, you have a book with, like, the longest title ever.  What is that?  Do I have to read all the signs?  No, don't read all the signs.  Oh, it's New York Times bestselling author, Guy Fieri.  That's the first sign.  Then it goes to the next one.  And it's Diners, Drive-Ins, Dives, The Funky Finds in Flavortown. 
[03:28:00]  And America's classic joints and killer comfort food includes behind-the-scenes stories and  jocularities from the Triple D crew and restaurant owners.  Cut me, Mick.  Cut me.  Wow.  Cut me, Mick.  Cut next to him, I swear.  That is, uh...  Listen, I don't know about these publishers.  Just put it in a search engine.  These publishers, yeah, exactly.  That's exactly what it is.  Get every tagline, every phrase you can. 
[03:28:30]  What might be associated with it?  Oh, but another book guy, man.  I'll tell you what it is.  How many of you is?  This is my fourth book, but my third Diners book.  And we've done, like, 600 locations on Triple D.  And so people ask, like, you know, well, how do we find the places and get us a map and  do this?  So we just eventually, I mean, this is, like, two years later for the third book, so...  So you could literally take a little trip, a little road trip, and stop in at some of  these jerks?  In the back of it, it gives you the address and the website and all the, you know...  Nice.  We have people that are traveling. 
[03:29:00]  I mean, I've run into folks when I'm out there doing the show that have done, like,  300, 400 locations.  Mm-hmm.  I'm like, what are you...  Wow.  I mean, they've got, like, RVs, they're doing more locations than I am, and then they're  bringing me portfolios of other places I should try.  I'm like, no, no, no, get ahead of the wave.  I mean, just let me go at my own...  Hey, you know, we're doing this fall, we're taking a bus trip, a tour bus from here, from  New York, down to where are we in?  Branson, Missouri, Nashville...  But we're going through Branson, because we have to check out, even though I think Yonko's  not going to be there, but check out the Barry Williams 70s long explosion in Kravaganza. 
[03:29:30]  It's a long story.  Was there a Yonko Schmierdorf reference in there?  I think Yonko...  That's why we're going.  Seriously?  Did I hear Yonko Schmierdorf?  Yeah, yeah.  That's Yonko.  That's why we're going.  I saw him in Vegas when I was in college.  Trace is just shaking his head.  Hey, guy, I want to ask you something.  Yes, sir.  You know, the magazine's on the airplanes, and they've got the list of the 10 best steakhouses  in America.  You know what I'm saying?  Yeah, I know.  But those people pay.  Do these people pay you to be in this book?  No, but, jeez, you started getting WWF on me. 
[03:30:00]  You just started pushing me.  Jesus, let me ask you a question.  Listen to me, brother.  I'm going to break you down.  All right, brother.  No.  Did you see how he turned?  Yes.  No, yes, yes.  Maybe.  I don't know.  I don't think.  I kind of like seeing somebody fucking alpha male in your ass at some point.  I'm telling you.  Just as you saw me start to stir the ice figure right in his face.  He's like, let me ask you something.  Yeah, yeah.  Dave.  Dave.  Suspended.  He turned around.  Man, I'll sush you.  I'll hook this suss in your nose, and you're in deep trouble, my friend. 
[03:30:30]  No, we don't take any.  I'll sush hook you, man.  We don't take any bribes, as far as you know.  That's some good shit, Quinn.  I never even thought of that.  I'm going to sush hook you, boy.  All I know is he's got his pinky curled up like he's going to gas somebody that knows  with it.  I might have missed that piece.  Yeah.  We're going with Trace to win Celebrity Apprentice. 
[03:31:00]  I might have to.  And Pendulet's a front part.  I don't know.  Boy, we are really fit.  Tell me about the road trip, by the way.  I want to hear about this.  I don't know.  We're just jumping on a bus.  So we're going to be stopping at a few places.  You know anywhere?  Where's a good place along the way?  Give us an example.  I will set up, you guys just give me the itinerary, I will set up the feeding zones, and we'll  weigh you at the beginning of the event.  Like McCluskey at his dinner with Michael Branson.  We'll put three of those Branson, Missouri buffets under your belt. 
[03:31:30]  Nice.  You know, I hear Yakov's place, Yakov's Dinner Adventure.  What happens is, he gives you a real metal tray that has a magnet on the back and it sticks  on the seat.  Because when you watch Yakov's Dinner Theater, it's in movie theater seats.  You're literally sitting in movie theater seats.  So they have magnets on the arm.  You click your metal tray.  But, don't get discouraged, genuine linen napkins, real silverware.  No, you get a spork.  I know you get a spork.  No, real, this is what they actually pitch on the website.  They're advertising this shit. 
[03:32:00]  That they have real linen napkins, real silverware, and a chicken cord on blue.  Which I'm sure is just being pumped out of there like the chocolate on that Lucy conveyor  belt.  Yeah.  They're going old school with that.  Yeah.  They're just doing Jerry's Jubilee.  Jerry's Jubilee.  Right.  I want to bake the last year.  We are very excited about that.  So how long will the trip take?  A week.  About a week.  We're just going to do Memphis.  Nashville.  Oh, we've got some good food.  I've got some good food.  We're going to Austin. 
[03:32:30]  I've got Austin great food.  Memphis great food.  Nashville great food.  I've got a barbecue joint right outside of Nashville.  Can we just walk in and go, Gaffieri sent us.  Rock and roll.  Pew, pew.  Yeah.  And we're going to try to set it up to that degree.  Like cakes and shit.  No, this will be good stuff.  How many people in your crew?  What's your posse going to look like?  Is this going to be like rubber ducky convoy?  Not including the broads that we're going to get on the bus.  The broads.  Oh, boy.  Yeah, sure.  I'll sleep by fucking 930 at night.  The posse didn't look like. 
[03:33:00]  You ever seen that scene?  They stopped at the gas station and one flew over the coopers next.  That's my right.  They're going to look like convoy, you know, with all these dilapidated rigs behind you.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  It's going to be pretty shitty.  People flashing you when they drive by on the bus.  I'm hoping to get maybe a couple of CBs so we could talk to each other.  That would be nice.  Go old school.  CBs would be a nice touch.  Yeah, buddy.  I was the wrangler.  Are you going to bring the hardware?  That's right.  What?  Are you going to bring the hardware?  I don't think I could bring my piece.  Why not?  Eh, you cross state lines.  Everything's fucked up.  It's not Smokey and the Bandit.  You can't do that. 
[03:33:30]  I had one on the bus one time.  I forgot about it.  It was in my nightstand by my bed.  And then we crossed the border going into Canada.  And they put me in jail.  Oh, they did lock you up?  Yeah, they locked me up for six hours.  They locked me up for about six hours.  Shouldn't they know?  How do they come on and handcuff you is what I want to know.  No shit.  All right, do six get on there and get him.  No, I copped to it immediately because it was like border crossing trainee day.  And so they were just like going through everything.  Oh, man.  So I immediately said, okay, wait.  I forgot about something.  And then I told them where it was. 
[03:34:00]  And then they just...  Hut, hut, hut, hut, hut, hut.  Shouldn't they take things like that into consideration and know that it's like, look,  it's Trey Sankins.  He's not going to fucking be blasting off in Canada with this gun.  It was an honest mistake, you know, as opposed to somebody you know is trying to commit some  kind of real crime there.  It was weird.  And then when they gave me my pistol, it was a little .380 automatic.  It wasn't a big deal.  But they handed it back to me and they had completely disassembled it.  So it was just all in pieces.  Kept souvenir bags.  I had to walk back across the border and mail it home. 
[03:34:30]  They wouldn't let me drive back across.  Wow.  Wow.  So now do you have a weapons charge on you in Canada or something?  No.  But that's why they really got mad because I had a weapons charge here.  Oh.  Oh, boy.  I like the fact that every question Trace answers is like another story.  Really?  It just leads to another whole story.  Pandora's box.  I love it, man.  We were shipping the Camaro we used for Triple D across the border.  And I'd just been at a, it just was at Kid Rock's place doing a shoot for Triple D. 
[03:35:00]  Oh, God.  And we loaded it up.  We loaded it up.  Uh-oh.  You don't like the beer or you don't like Rock?  They found guns and dope and women in the trunk of the car.  So we loaded it up.  He makes this great beer.  He makes this great beer.  And we had it on the show.  And I wanted to take some back to California.  So I threw it in the trunk of my Camaro.  Well, I just happened to forget the Camaro was on its way to Canada.  So I get a call from this driver stressing out, there's beer in the back of your car.  Where the hell did that come from? 
[03:35:30]  Yeah, I don't know.  Oh, shit.  But they actually, they let it go.  They let the car come into Canada and cruise around with the 10 cases and cruise back out.  Nice.  Did they know it was that?  No weapons charged.  No weapons, yeah.  You gotta watch that.  I hate the fact that, you know, you go from one state to another and fucking your gun's good here.  It's not good here.  You're responsible and we trust you and you went through all the hoops here.  Like in New York, you gotta go through so much, I should be able to cover every goddamn state in the Union.  But, you know, I can't drive across Jersey unless it's in a locked box, separate from the ammo. 
[03:36:00]  You're not stopping until you get to Pennsylvania.  You know, shit like that.  Which is really stupid because then if someone steals the car, instead of the gun being on you where you have possession of it and know where it is and it's not going to get in anyone else's hands,  now someone's got your gun and your car.  The laws make no sense.  They punish the law-abiding citizen, do nothing to make anyone safer.  Where is this coming from?  I've never heard you talk like this.  Exactly, Carl.  Do you know a New Yorker just got arrested?  A New Yorker just got arrested because of the new law that only allows seven rounds in your magazine. 
[03:36:30]  And he had ten, because he had a ten-round magazine.  Right, right, right.  And he got pulled over.  He had a pistol on his seat, a state, he pulled him over and looked, saw the gun.  The guy says, yes, I'm completely legal.  I got this, the trooper checked the magazine, found that there were, you know, three more too many bullets, or two.  I think it was a nine-round magazine that he had, so it was only two extra bullets, and arrested him.  And now the guy's got a weapons charge on him because of that.  How did that make anyone any safer?  How did that law just make New York a safer place to live? 
[03:37:00]  Because a guy that legally owns a gun, has all the permit, had two bullets too many in his magazine.  The laws are ridiculous.  Talk to your boy Cuomo.  Yeah, well, he's one of your people.  You know, the gun charge I had was a similar kind of thing.  I wasn't doing anything illegal.  How did it go?  I had a pistol, and it was in the pocket of the door of my truck.  And at the time, I didn't have a permit, carry permit.  But anyway, so the pistol was there in the door, and it was loaded, of course. 
[03:37:30]  And I got pulled over for something else, and the guy looks, and he goes, is that gun loaded?  And I said, is your gun loaded?  Yes, it's loaded.  You know?  I carried some paperweight.  There are two useless things in this world, a dull knife and an empty gun, you know?  I love it.  So, he said, assume the position, and took me directly to jail.  Wow.  But that's my gun charge.  I mean, I didn't, you know, I didn't like it.  What state was that?  What state was that?  That was Tennessee.  Tennessee? 
[03:38:00]  Wow.  Now I have a carry permit to Tennessee.  In Tennessee.  So they're all cool with it.  If you hook up, like, fucking Ted Nugent, they, like, deputize him, and he could carry anywhere  in the country.  A bazooka.  You gotta get that.  Well, I like the fact that Trey doesn't think he's getting arrested.  He's like, hey, officer, there's two useless things in this world, a dull knife and an unloaded  gun.  Instead of going, it's loaded, sir, but I'm on my way.  Where'd you sell him, hey, fuck you, you're not going to do nothing about it.  It's loaded. 
[03:38:30]  No, he did.  He asked me, he says, is that gun loaded, sir?  And I said, hell, is your gun loaded?  You know what I mean?  Come on, man.  Yeah, it's loaded.  Absolutely.  Why would you have a loaded gun?  Six steps out of the truck.  Well, I look like I'm in a Liberace movie.  Hey, hey, hey.  I got caught stealing bubble yum once.  And they put me in the back.  My dad had to come get me.  Wow, that is frightening.  Hard time.  Trey's lived the life here, man.  The whole, the work ethic, the getting hurt on a real man's job. 
[03:39:00]  Right.  The country music star, weapons charges, Jesus Christ.  It's fantastic.  How are we going to tell Penn Jillette that we're not rooting for him anymore?  I know.  Should we call him?  I already told him.  I'm all in with Trace now.  Yeah.  And this is fantastic.  Yeah, look.  It's trying the ice cream.  Now it's a little mushy.  See, it's wonderful.  Oh, that's good.  We probably should take a break.  You know what?  Get Trace out.  I got to go anyway.  This would be good on Waffles.  This would be great on Waffles.  I got to go to Atlantic City and hang out with my peeps. 
[03:39:30]  Atlantic City, where do you stay when you go there?  I don't stay anywhere there.  I go there and they give me money and I leave.  Oh, okay.  I got to go do a show tonight at Caesars there.  Caesars in AC.  Can we play one of your new songs?  That'd be cool.  I didn't come over here just to talk to you.  No, we're going to do it, though.  He throws a smack down.  No matter what he says, you're that close from getting punched in the face.  He is a very intimidating guy.  Authentic.  Say no to a woman or watch the world end. 
[03:40:00]  Say no to a woman.  All right, we're going to do that for two days.  Watch the world ends.  It's a really sappy love song I did with Colby Calais.  It's beautiful, but it's not good for this show.  You know, I don't think any...  Nothing beautiful is good for this show.  I don't know if any of the songs on this album are good for this show.  You should go back and do something off one of my other albums.  Whop a man's ass or something like that.  We played Arlington yesterday.  Oh, did you?  That's a tear jerk.  What the fuck?  A lot of people commented that they were balling. 
[03:40:30]  Yeah, that's a tear jerk of that song.  And we played another one.  What was the other one yesterday?  Tonky Tonk Badonky Donk.  No, we played that.  Of course.  Well, that's a love song.  That's pretty sensitive.  Of course it is.  I mean, especially when the moneymaker line comes by.  You know, it really brings a tear.  What was the third one we played?  I was a father of five daughters.  That one really...  Oh, shit.  You got five daughters?  Yeah.  Wow.  Good luck with that.  You know, I've had people say,  man, why do you have five daughters?  Because I wanted to have one son. 
[03:41:00]  And after the fifth one, I didn't even leave the hospital.  I just walked down and I said,  dude, you've got to do something about this, man.  That's it, huh?  That was it.  Man.  Wow.  How old are they?  How old are the girls?  28, 24, 15, 11, and 8.  All right.  So you've had to deal with guys coming out.  All of them, yeah.  How is that for a dad?  I've never had a problem with it.  Some of my life.  Of course, you're 6'4".  Yeah.  Hello.  Man, that would suck. 
[03:41:30]  What part?  Man, you meet a girl, you're liking her and stuff,  and it's like, oh, let me introduce you to my dad.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  By the way, my dad's Trace Hank.  And you're like, oh, my God.  He doesn't put up with shit.  Yeah.  He wants to wrestle you in the back yard.  Yeah.  Right.  Just don't fucking stay away from his pinky.  Put it in your nose.  Yeah.  Don't let him suss hook you.  Oh, my God, King.  He's going for the suss hook.  That's going to be my wrestling go-to move, man. 
[03:42:00]  I'm going to do some WWE, man.  There it is.  There you go.  Go to the suss hook.  Trace, thanks so much for coming in.  Absolutely.  What a pleasure, man.  Hey, it was a pleasure to meet you guys.  It's a lot of fun.  I've been a fan for a long time.  It's great, man.  Thanks, man.  Colin Quinn.  Wow.  Colin.  Pleasure, Trace.  Thank you.  Liberace.  Liberace in the corner.  Tom Papa.  Got you.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, it gets worse.  More of Opie and Anthony's worst in 2013 so far.  Coming up. 
[03:42:30]  Opie and Anthony's worst in 2013 so far continues right now.  Hit it now.  Now.  It's the worst of 2013 so far.  Opie and Anthony are on vacation.  So I, Sam Roberts, will be bringing to you the best moments that 2013 has supplied thus far.  Throughout the week, the after show, which I host after the Opie and Anthony show, has been on fire this year.  If you don't believe me, you can check out all my stuff at NotSam.com. 
[03:43:00]  But the reason I bring up the after show is because this year, Lady Di, you remember the retarded Laverne and Shirley?  Lady Di and Marion?  Well, Lady Di, our old character.  Not the real Lady Di.  She's dead.  But our Lady Di called into the after show randomly one day.  And I couldn't believe it.  I interviewed her about how her life was going and she's a complete wreck.  So the next day, she calls the Opie and Anthony show.  Well, Opie's not there. 
[03:43:30]  But Anthony and Jim get into it with her and talk to her and all this stuff.  Finally, weeks later, Opie's in studio and randomly, we get a call from Lady Di.  With Opie in studio, we go over her life and we find out exactly how much of it has changed in the last nine years.  It's Lady Di as we compare her past life to her present life on the worst of 2013.  So far.  ONA's worst of 2013. 
[03:44:00]  So far.  Who's this?  Who's this?  Who do you think it is?  Hi, Opie.  Whoa.  Wait, who is this?  It's Di.  Diana.  Lady Di.  I don't remember.  Oh, you don't remember.  No, I'm serious.  Who are you?  You know who I am?  Explain.  I don't know who you are.  Oh, my God.  We talk to hundreds of people a day.  Who is this?  All right.  Well, we used to come over to the studio, Marion and I. 
[03:44:30]  We used to come over there at, you know, WNEW and everything.  Hmm.  Doesn't really ring a bell.  Hi, Jimmy.  Hi, Anthony.  Hello.  Do you guys know this broad?  Yeah.  No, no, no.  We just wanted to find out if you guys are going to be available.  Are you going to be in the studio next Friday?  Not this Friday.  Next Friday.  For what?  We just want to find out if you're either going to be there or on vacation.  You know.  Are I on the king? 
[03:45:00]  I don't know.  Why do you want to know if we're going to be here next Friday?  Because we're going to stop by.  Who?  Oh, God.  Me and Marion.  Who's Marion?  Hi to everybody.  What?  She says hi to everybody.  But who is this Marion?  Who are you?  It's Marion and me.  Oh, my God.  You know who we are.  The retarded Laverne and Shirley.  Oh.  Does that ring a bell?  A little bit.  All right. 
[03:45:30]  That's like many, many years ago.  It sort of rings a bell.  Yeah.  Well, you still consider us the retarded Laverne and Shirley.  I haven't considered you anything in many, many years.  Ugh.  Ugh.  That voice.  Yeah, okay.  How are you doing with the drinking?  It's okay.  All right.  Are you doing?  I drink occasionally.  Yes.  I drink occasionally.  When's the last time you drank, and don't lie?  Yesterday. 
[03:46:00]  Okay.  Well, then, what was the occasion?  It was Monday.  The occasion was I was home.  So, what was the, last time you called, you said you were going to go out for a job.  What job hunting did you do?  Oh, right.  Oh, very good.  Yeah, I did.  Yeah, no, I went out looking for a job and everything.  I went out looking for a couple of jobs.  So, what did you do?  I went over to Dunkin' Donuts, which is in my neighborhood.  Right.  Sure.  I went over there, and.  Are we listening to a phone call from 12 years ago?  Yeah.  Huh?  What? 
[03:46:30]  How is it that someone's life doesn't change at all?  Not an iota.  Nope.  What do you mean?  This phone call could be 12 years old.  You're still.  I mean, I've been out looking for a job.  You're still a drunk making believe you're not a drunk that's making believe that she's  actually going to find work.  This is a 12-year phone call.  Yeah, but no, no, no.  Yeah, but no, no, no.  I've actually been out looking for work.  Oh, so how is that going?  Iraq, find a phone call from 12 years ago, please. 
[03:47:00]  This is the exact same fucking shit.  I have to wait for these places to call me back.  No, but how many places did you look for?  Last time we talked to you, we established that you service Bill Orly for your rent.  Right.  You did not establish that.  No, we did.  We did.  Yes.  Wait, wait.  I'm behind on this one because I wasn't here that day.  She sucks the guy's cock that she's staying at the place.  Oh, don't do that.  Yes, you did.  You admitted it.  You admitted it.  He treats your mouth like a pocket vagina.  Right.  Oh, Jesus. 
[03:47:30]  No.  No disrespect.  You're a fleshlight with a dim bulb.  A flesh heavy.  By the way, by the way.  Oh, what?  I'm going to go see the monkeys.  No one asked you.  Yeah.  I'm going to go see them July 17th.  Yeah.  In Red Bank.  Remember the Cal Basie Theater, Jim?  I do, yes.  How does we remember?  That's where they're going to be at.  We learned last time she called in, instead of looking for jobs, she sits at home and watches 
[03:48:00]  the monkeys.  She watches the monkeys and the Parches family.  No.  Who gives a fuck that you're going to see the monkeys?  Who gives a fudge?  Why not?  Oh.  Why would that be interesting to anyone?  It's not.  It's not.  Tell Opie the Ron Jeremy story that you called in to tell.  Oh, God.  Oh, yeah.  Well, I met Ron Jeremy and he gave me a t-shirt.  Holy fuck.  And I looked him up and down.  I looked him up and down.  And I said, well, hey, you know, I was just imagining what he would look like naked, 
[03:48:30]  you know.  Yeah, it's hard to find images of that.  Yeah.  Just look in a mirror.  You know, that bothered him.  No, I mean, I don't know.  What I'm trying to say is, you know, I was trying to imagine him like he looked years  ago.  We understand.  I remember him years ago.  What the fuck?  Who gives a fuck about any of this?  Do you remember how she just would have this inane conversation?  I heard when she finally came back, I think, on Sam's show. 
[03:49:00]  And then the next day I was out and you guys talked to her.  It's like, but this is the exact same shit from 12 years ago.  Yeah.  It bothered her.  Ron Jeremy, that she looked at him like that.  He didn't like it.  He remembered the incident.  He felt it was really kind of dehumanizing.  And he's beyond that point.  And you were supposed to apologize.  And you never did.  I don't know what he felt like when I was looking at him.  Well, I'm telling you because I know him.  A lot of people look at him.  Not like that.  Not like the way you, because he mentioned that to me.  No, no, no.  Not like that.  Okay.  But anyway, I got a free t-shirt.  No, tell him what you said, though. 
[03:49:30]  Because that was the big thing.  Like the interaction that you had.  The interaction I had?  With you, it's an O shirt.  No, no, no.  She's fat.  It's a big old.  Oh, no, no.  They're brand new shirts.  Wait a minute.  Hold on.  So you're looking for a job?  I'm looking for a job?  She's the female chip.  No, no, no.  Has that been said yet?  Yeah.  What about married?  They don't know anything about me looking for a job.  But they both are.  You went to Dunkin' Donuts, right?  Yeah, what'd you do?  Did you dunk a bunch of them? 
[03:50:00]  What happened there?  I don't know.  What do you mean you don't know?  What did you do?  You just walked in and stared?  What did you do?  It's not an application.  What did you do besides clear the fucking racks?  I just filled out the application, and I'm waiting for them to call me back.  Wait, wait, wait.  Can I start from the beginning?  I haven't.  And by the way, the liquor store, too.  Of course.  Oh, good.  Donuts, liquor.  Why would they hire you?  Donuts and liquor.  That's brilliant.  Lady Di.  What?  That's the whole statement. 
[03:50:30]  Yeah.  I believe I haven't seen or talked to you in eight years.  Yeah.  Could you explain one thing?  I haven't talked to you in eight years.  These guys have talked to you recently.  What has changed in your life in eight years?  Good question.  Last we checked in, you were blowing hobos, I believe.  No.  That never happened.  I guess it did.  So what has changed in eight years?  Um, well, we have a place to stay.  Me and my roommate. 
[03:51:00]  He's your boyfriend.  He's your fucking, yeah.  You blow him.  You blow him so you don't have to pay rent.  Exactly.  Come on.  Let's.  No, no, no.  I help out with the bills around here the best I could.  But you, how?  You don't have a job.  His name is Bill.  Wait, wait, wait.  She means.  But don't let her off the hook.  How do you help out with the bills?  Well, whenever I can.  But you, like Anne said, you don't have a job.  So where's this money coming from to pay the bills?  Alfie, my dad left me money, okay?  Son of a bitch.  She's been living off her dead dad. 
[03:51:30]  Her dead dad's money.  No, no, no, no.  That's, no, no, no.  Both my parents left me money.  How much?  Oh, that's none of anybody's business.  How much?  How much?  Ballpark.  It was a million, if that's what you're asking.  No, we don't think it's millions.  Was it more than $30?  Yes.  More than $30.  More than $30.  All right.  All right.  Was it $10,000?  Something like that.  Somewhere around there.  $13,000.  Okay?  $13,000.  So you went through that already.  Yeah.  No, no, no, no. 
[03:52:00]  Well, she doesn't pay rent.  She doesn't.  She blows the guy for rent.  She sucks his cock for rent.  So we know she spends some money on booze.  She sucks dick to get her rent paid.  Okay.  Imagine how proud her dead dad would be.  Oh, God, right?  He left me $18,000 and then another $13,000, $14,000 on top of that.  What?  So how much did he leave you?  $30,000?  Just say that.  Something like that, yeah.  Don't just keep giving us something like that.  Don't give us figures that make us do the math.  Just tell us.  All right.  Hold on a minute.  Lady Di, hold on a minute.  Hold on a minute. 
[03:52:30]  I begged DRock to find a clip of Lady Di.  He found one from 2004?  The beginning of November, 2004.  We were on the air for a month.  It's a quick clip, right?  This clip is almost nine years old.  Nine years old.  All right.  This is going to make my point.  Go ahead.  Still out there looking for a job.  Yeah, sure you are.  Yeah.  Pounding the pavement.  Well, at least you sound kind of sober today.  She does that whenever she walks.  I am sober today.  What job are you looking for?  A tequila worm eater?  No. 
[03:53:00]  No.  No, no, no.  Jobs in town.  I'm trying to look like all over the place.  Clothing stores, all that other stuff.  That must be where you are now, right?  Looking for work?  Yeah.  So where are you?  Same conversation.  Well, I'm at home right now.  Oh, you're at home right now.  That's where all the jobs are.  Okay, that's from nine years ago.  Wow.  Dude, that's 2004.  Yeah, and we're having the same conversation nine years later.  Lady Di, did you hear that?  Hold on, hold on, hold on.  I'm sorry.  Let's put her back.  Lady Di, did you hear that?  Musetta. 
[03:53:30]  Yeah.  Yeah.  Now, that was you nine years ago.  Same conversation.  Nine years ago?  Oh, and then she repeats.  Remember this, Opie?  Wait, wait, wait, wait.  Hold on.  Wasn't I kind of like homeless nine years ago?  You're homeless now?  You're a bum now.  You weren't sucking cock.  Because you're sucking dick.  She's questioning the old version of herself.  Right, right.  That was you.  Wait a minute.  Were you homeless or not?  I don't know.  That was you from nine years ago saying that you were at home looking for a job.  Okay, I got you.  I got you on this one. 
[03:54:00]  All right, that was nine years ago.  Now I remember.  Okay, tell us something, Lane.  But don't you find it a little disheartening, Lady Di, that you're having the same exact conversation with us nine years later and nothing has improved in your life?  You're expecting different results?  Nothing has been improving because there's really no work out there, whether you believe it or not.  There's really not that much work.  Nine years!  And you're not looking for a position at IBM.  She's been looking for work. 
[03:54:30]  There's no jobs at radio, but I think there's still jobs at D&D.  Yeah.  She's been looking for work so long that when she started, the economy was good.  Right, the economy was good when you started.  Yeah.  Yeah, well, I guess not for me.  A little chuckle.  That was a great chuckle.  Wait, he died.  What are you doing?  Not just the name.  I remember it.  Why don't you fucking work? 
[03:55:00]  I don't know.  Yes, you do.  I really don't know.  I go there.  No, you don't.  You're not looking for a job.  You're lying.  You're a liar.  You're a compulsive liar.  Yeah.  You're not being honest with anybody.  You're lying to yourself.  What did I say to you?  Get sober.  That's why.  Get sober.  And get a job.  You lost your son.  You didn't take care of him.  What's that?  I didn't lose him.  Yeah, you did. 
[03:55:30]  You didn't raise him.  During the time where he needed a mother and needed a mother that was going to support him,  and you fucking did nothing for him, and he had to leave your house, because you didn't  have one at that point, and live with other people.  Who said I was living with other people?  What did you just eat?  Oh, my God.  What were you paying first and last?  What did you just eat?  Dick in the mouth.  Yeah.  That's fucking July's rent right there in our fucking mouth.  It's just unloaded July.  All right, look. 
[03:56:00]  I will pay the rent.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Hold on.  I can't take her anymore.  All right.  Answer this simple question.  Good luck with this.  Sure.  What did you just eat?  What did I just eat?  I had a steak last night, a London boil.  What did you just put in your mouth?  Oh, a cigarette.  You just ate a cigarette?  What are you, a fucking goat shit? 
[03:56:30]  I just put a cigarette.  I just, well, you know, it's kind of like hard to put a cigarette in your mouth when  you have a cell phone in one hand and one free hand.  Yeah, I know, because I need at least two hands to juggle when I put it.  No, it's not.  It's easy to do.  Right.  That's easy to do if you're that fucking, if you're Steve Gleason could do that.  Oh, now see?  I have to get one of those handsets for this phone, or a different phone anyway.  How about get a job?  Yeah, how are you affording cigarettes?  You just get a job, Di.  How are you affording cigarettes? 
[03:57:00]  Good question.  You have to give up the ass?  How do I afford cigarettes?  To give up the ass for the cigarettes?  I think cigarettes are just hand jobs.  No, Opie, no.  Oh, then it must be your dead dance money.  I thought it was a real fucking question.  I'm sorry.  Well, you know what?  You know what?  And that's a pretty sensitive subject right now.  What is, sweetheart?  What is?  What's sensitive?  Oh, my dad.  That's a pretty sensitive.  Why?  He's dead.  He passed away.  What's sensitive about it?  I don't know he passed away.  Yes, he did.  How was Father's Day when you're spending his hard-earned money on beer and fucking cigarettes? 
[03:57:30]  No, I spent...  How was...  Happy Father's Day there?  What'd you do?  I spent his hard-earned money on putting flowers on his grave.  Oh, yeah?  Yeah.  What'd you go with?  Fucking plastic...  I went with my roommate.  Oh, did you suck...  Did you suck his cock on your dad's grave?  No, I did not.  I wouldn't.  Oh, come on.  I wouldn't do stuff like that.  Obviously not.  Hey, Chris.  I love Blink.  It's my favorite.  I don't do stuff like that. 
[03:58:00]  And I don't think anybody else did either.  I didn't see anything else going on in the cemetery.  So I don't do stuff like that.  All right.  Yeah.  Lady Di.  I won't be bad.  I won't get a job.  No, you won't.  You said this nine years.  Nine years.  I just want to...  Nine years.  Nine years you said this.  For nine fucking years.  You're not getting a job.  Fucking years.  Well, what do you want me to do?  Get a job!  Why don't you get a fucking job?  And they don't call you back. 
[03:58:30]  No, because you're a babbling idiot.  Yeah.  First of all, you probably don't present yourself well.  Right.  You probably go in there with your big bloated W.C. Fields face when you're fucking...  You're drunkard.  And then you babble like an idiot where they throw the application away before the fucking  bell rings when you're leaving the door.  And then you fucking...  Yes!  And then you don't like...  They follow up.  You're the one that's supposed to call them.  But she...  I know that. 
[03:59:00]  But...  But she...  Because I have their phone numbers.  That was just so mean.  Of course it was.  It's true.  It's true.  Ah, yes!  I'd like to apply for a position in your organization!  Ah, yes!  Perhaps I could put jelly in the donuts!  Ah, yes!  You fucking pig!  She could be the most frustrating person I've ever fucking come across. 
[03:59:30]  I'm not the most frustrating person.  I think you're...  I think you are.  I think you are.  I need a position to make some currency to purchase more alcoholic beverages!  Yay!  Oh, boy, oh, boy.  Big bloated W.C.  She is.  Oh, man.  Oh, man.  We're just having fun.  Look at that.  Yeah, I know you are.  What are they doing?  I don't know.  They're studying our studio.  Maybe we could be part of this film.  You... 
[04:00:00]  Maybe they're just going to use your studio.  You are a disaster, Lady Di.  Thank you.  Well, nine fucking years.  Yeah, I found the tape, man.  I knew it was the same conversation, and Iraq fucking backed me up with a clip.  And your voice is exactly the same.  Yeah, it was the same conversation.  I know.  I was still looking for a job back then.  You've never looked for a job.  No.  I don't think you've ever looked for a job.  Okay.  In nine years, you can accidentally get a job.  Right.  Where you wake up and go, holy shit, I'm employed. 
[04:00:30]  Right, right, right.  I wasn't even trying.  Exactly.  Okay.  Nine years ago.  Yeah.  Yes.  Nine years ago.  Yeah.  Couldn't you...  You could luck up on a job.  Right.  Maybe stand in for a pig in a pig roast or something.  Okay.  Yeah.  And you're coming in...  That was just me.  I'm sorry.  And you're coming in next...  I mean...  Oh, my God.  Are you...  Go ahead, Di.  What do you say?  No.  No, no, no.  You're about right.  That's around the time that I was looking for a job.  We know we're right.  We have the date on the fucking tape. 
[04:01:00]  We know.  Idiots.  You're right.  You're right.  Yeah, we know.  We're like, we need her to tell us we're right.  She gave that one to you guys.  Yeah, yeah.  Holy fuck.  Lady Di.  All right.  The reason that I called is...  The reason?  Are you guys going to be around on 28th?  Oh, God.  I said, why are you coming in here next Friday?  Because we would like to see you guys again.  Is there something wrong with that?  For what reason?  I don't know.  We're big radio stars now.  We don't need your shit anymore. 
[04:01:30]  All right.  Okay.  Oh, come on now.  How are you that fun?  She's taking me seriously.  How are you?  What?  You'll be radio stars.  Really?  What?  You're on a regular radio station.  Oh.  Oh.  Shit.  That fucking hurts.  Exactly.  No, I'm not.  Never mind.  Why don't you get a regular job?  Wait.  Hold on.  Hold on.  All right.  Hold on. 
[04:02:00]  Hold on, Lady Di, if you can for a second.  Why is that guy just...  That jockey?  Why is that jockey just staring at us?  Staring at us.  Who's a guy?  There's 20 people outside our studio with Chris Rock.  They're just like studying our studio and the facility in general.  Go ahead, Di.  He just talks.  Hold on.  I know.  Hold on.  She just talks.  I was collecting unemployment for a long time.  Right?  Oh, great.  That doesn't mean you're working.  You're a burden.  That meant I put into it.  You didn't put all that in.  Believe me, you didn't put as much into unemployment as you take out in nine fucking years. 
[04:02:30]  Are you a fan of Obama?  Sure.  I love the president.  Why?  Of course you do.  Because you're a fucking...  Because you're a bum that doesn't do anything.  You are a bum.  You should have dirty cheeks and be riding a train around the country.  Oh, please don't start that.  You'd be in a boxcar.  Was it easier to be a bum under the Bush administration?  True.  That's his current Obama administration.  Great question. 
[04:03:00]  She knows.  She's a two-president fucking slouch.  A two-president bum.  Yeah.  You are a bum.  You've been a bum.  Iraq was our ally.  Now, are you guys going to be around next Friday?  Ask that again.  You haven't said that enough times.  You fucking...  Oh, my God.  And I'll say again, why?  What are you going to do for the show?  We don't just have people come in and say hi.  Yeah.  Except Chris Rock.  Good point, Jimmy.  Good point.  What?  We'll do something for the show.  What?  How about we drop you in Lakehurst, New Jersey, and you recreate the Hindenburg. 
[04:03:30]  You big pig.  Because she's fat.  She's a blimp.  Oh, she's a blimp.  Where's Marion?  You're going to be around.  Don't worry about it.  We'll figure out something.  Where's Marion?  Yeah, where's Marion?  Working?  She's working.  Of course she is.  She's working.  She's got the same job she's had.  That's what we're talking about.  She's working at the same place she's worked at for how long?  Yeah.  She's a stand-in for Shrek.  Let's not pretend she's on a pig, too. 
[04:04:00]  Exactly.  I'm Shrek.  She's in a theme park somewhere.  Yeah.  I'm going to put in a few more applications here.  Oh, shut up.  You're not.  We got the clip from nine years ago.  Where are you going to go today to put in applications?  I don't know.  Let me see.  No, no, no.  Where are you going?  What?  Where are you going?  Yeah, today.  Where are you going?  I was thinking family dollar or something. 
[04:04:30]  You're going nowhere, that means.  Family dollar.  Family dollar?  You have neither.  I was thinking about it.  Yeah.  Oh, that's great.  I think about doing things all the time.  Yeah.  When are you going to do it?  We talked to you weeks ago.  It's taken you weeks to think about the idea of working at family dollar?  You drove your husband to kiss a train the way Michael kissed Fredo in The Godfather 2. 
[04:05:00]  What?  He was not my husband.  What was he?  The father of her child.  I remember that.  Same thing.  He was not my husband.  Oh, sorry.  Isn't that funny?  He was a cow catcher and then he got hit by one thing.  Jesus.  No.  What?  I got over that.  Oh, yeah.  I'm glad you did.  Yeah.  Go ahead, Dax.  Good for you.  The train got over him.  I did.  I did.  What were you saying?  That was such a long time ago.  I got over it.  Oh, good for you.  We figured you'd pass by.  What was that? 
[04:05:30]  Isn't that ironic?  He got hit with a choo-choo and that seems to be all you do all day.  Choo.  Choo.  No.  What?  I chewed you all day.  Oh, wow.  Sorry.  I chewed last night.  I chewed on your fucking roommate's ball sack.  Yeah.  You know what you should chew on?  The fucking business end of a shotgun.  What's your chew on that?  The business end.  It's not.  Lady Di.  Yeah, Di.  Where are you going? 
[04:06:00]  Where are you going?  Why are you still trying?  Where are you going to get a job?  Go ahead, Di.  Today.  What's your itinerary for today?  I told you either today or right now.  I'm going to make it official.  Either today or tomorrow.  I'm going to go over to Family Dollar and apply over there.  Yeah?  You made it official.  What are your qualifications?  Great.  What are you going to write on the application?  My qualifications is I'm a cashier.  All right.  You're a cashier.  How much money do you want to make?  And when it says, how much money are you looking for?  What are you putting in there?  What are you putting in there?  I don't expect to make a high salary. 
[04:06:30]  Really?  No.  I don't expect that.  Family Dollar?  Yeah.  Family Dollar.  Why?  God.  What are you going to do for them?  They went down the street for me.  What are you going to do for them?  I told you.  Cashier.  Oh, man.  Imagine being in line with this one.  How are you?  Oh, just ring me up and shut the fuck up.  Get me out of this shithole store.  How are you?  Welcome to Family Dollar.  Welcome to our establishment.  If I may ring you up here. 
[04:07:00]  What have you purchased today, madam?  Oh, my goodness.  Oh, yes.  My good friend.  Mind if I have a nip off of this booze while you wait?  Do we have her in contact info?  I don't drink when I'm working.  You don't work.  Exactly.  You chose drinking.  I don't drink while I'm working.  That's like me saying I don't drink while I fly planes.  We know that she hasn't had a job in at least nine. 
[04:07:30]  No, probably any W, too, right?  Yeah.  At least 12 years.  You haven't worked in 12 years.  You fucking burden.  I haven't worked, okay, in 12 years, I'll be.  I have worked.  What have you done?  Yes, I have.  Where?  Yes, I have.  Where?  All right.  Let me see.  Right after.  I used to work at a Dunkin' Donuts in Westfield.  How long?  How long?  Don't lie.  I was there for a good, like, eight months.  Eight?  Eight months.  We believe you.  Yes, don't worry.  And then I couldn't afford my apartment, so I had to move back to Elizabeth. 
[04:08:00]  Is that where you suck dick for, um...  The rent?  For rent?  Well, the rent was pretty high over there.  It was pretty high in Westfield, so I couldn't afford it.  She was homeless for a while and blowing homeless guys.  Yeah, you were blowing homeless guys.  Who lived in Elizabeth that you went back there?  Believe me.  Trust me.  I was not doing stuff like that.  You know, it's funny.  Opie's rage is reverting back to 12 years ago, too. 
[04:08:30]  Yes, yes.  She's bringing out all...  Holy fuck, it's frustrating.  Who lives with you?  That was the last job I had when I was living in Westfield.  Yeah.  That was the last job I had.  And how many years ago...  Before that, too.  How many years ago was that?  Oh, my God.  2004?  And then you got fired from the supermarket for the credit card scam.  Yeah, yeah, I got fired.  So why haven't you worked in...  Hold on.  Why haven't you worked in nine years?  I was doing four Dunkin' Donuts.  Why haven't you worked in nine years? 
[04:09:00]  You know what?  I really...  I can't tell you about that.  I really, really don't know.  Classified.  I know.  I don't know.  I have a...  Can I take a guess?  What?  Because you're a...  You're a drunken person, and your life is just...  You're running in circles, and you're wasting your life because you won't stop drinking.  Oh, my God.  You are wasting your life, aren't you?  Unless you enjoy the drinking that much.  But who does, right?  Right, Jimmy?  Yeah, I mean, after a point...  Is this how you saw your life turning out? 
[04:09:30]  Just having no job, just drinking in the afternoon?  Like, is this what you saw for yourself?  No.  No.  Well, then why don't you do something about it?  I've been looking for jobs in nine years.  I have been looking.  But I had no success.  You're bullshitting.  How do you not have success looking for menial, minimum-wage jobs for nine fucking years?  No one can't get a job in nine years.  Well, minimum wage is better than nothing.  I didn't...  Oh, yeah.  That's true, Ant.  It is.  Hold on.  You know, that's a lot of money for some of us. 
[04:10:00]  She's missing my...  You're right.  Really?  I know.  Yeah, right?  One more thing.  Okay.  When I came back to Elizabeth, I found the job at the temp agency.  I worked there for a couple of years.  What'd you do?  Anything they told me to.  Now.  Wait.  Hold on.  Hold on.  I used to...  Were you a temp to hire?  I did some of that temp shit.  Go ahead, Ant.  No, no, no.  It was fine.  I had no problem with it.  But that's not what I asked.  She answers questions that aren't being asked, and she doesn't answer questions that are being 
[04:10:30]  asked.  It's amazing.  I used to do assembly work for a temp agency.  They used to take...  Could you build something to stand on in a noose?  Assembly work?  Could you assemble that?  What would you...  You can't put anything together.  What would you assemble?  You can't even put a thought together.  You can't slap your life together.  What did you assemble?  Yes.  Assembly line?  Anything.  Clothes, whatever.  Put them in boxes and stuff like that. 
[04:11:00]  You know, put the tags on them and put them back in the boxes and seal them up and stuff  like that.  That's what I used to do for the temp agency.  Seriously.  Well, we weren't questioning.  No one thought that you were lying.  I mean, I'm just telling you, that's what I used to do.  All right.  Great.  You answered a question.  Yeah, well.  And that job was on the books, so.  You know, we're good.  But, and then after that, where'd I go after that?  Let me see.  After the temp agency, I'm trying to think right now. 
[04:11:30]  Oh, who's in the background?  Oh, okay.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Is he stirring?  Is that Bill in the background?  Is Bill stirring?  Well, Bill is, yeah.  He's in the kitchen.  Yeah.  Can we talk to Bill?  Have you guys talked to Bill yet?  Yeah.  Yeah.  We talked to Bill.  He's a man of few words.  Yeah.  Okay.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Yeah.  Put him on.  Let me talk to you, Bill.  Come on, Bill.  They want to talk to you for a little bit.  He's doing paperwork.  He can't talk.  What kind of paperwork is he doing?  What is he doing?  What kind of paperwork?  Do you have to get your shots? 
[04:12:00]  Huh?  Is there a lawsuit because you bit a neighbor?  He said money, paperwork.  He's busy.  What kind of paperwork?  What's he filling out paperwork for?  What a weird house.  It's weird.  Yeah.  Huh?  For what money?  It doesn't mean anything.  He's applying to the state for the right to raise a wild animal.  I have a wild boar in every sense of the word in my house.  Wild and crashing. 
[04:12:30]  Yeah.  He's very busy.  Yeah.  As you do nothing.  I have a boar here and he's spelling it both ways.  I'm trying to think after the temp.  Hold on.  Hold on.  I have to ask him this.  Maybe.  Maybe.  Go ahead.  Phil, where did I work after the temp agent?  All of a sudden you're going to hear suey.  Where?  Oh, yeah.  That's right.  What did he say?  I was a crossing guard.  Oh, Jesus.  A crossing guard. 
[04:13:00]  Believe me.  I almost forgot about that.  Isn't that volunteer work?  Yeah.  It was.  Does that pay?  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  It does.  And how did you lose that job?  Were you having a great day at work until you got distracted and heard a dull thud?  I didn't realize you were going to be out of a gig.  Watch a little patent leather shoe skip across the pavement.  Something like that happened.  Exactly.  Did you see a curious George book skid across the fucking pavement after a thud?  She's answering this.  Who answers jokes? 
[04:13:30]  Were you babbling at someone and then you heard a fucking screech of tires and a horn?  No.  No.  Did you see a school bus go over what looked like a speed bump that you didn't realize  was there?  No.  No.  Of course.  Answer the jokes, please.  Keep answering it.  It was nothing like that.  I was usually very good on the job.  How did you lose that job?  Yeah.  Honestly, you were drinking.  I don't want to talk about that part.  What happened?  What happened?  Come on, lady.  Stop playing coy.  Stop.  You gave us nothing today.  What happened? 
[04:14:00]  Your life's an open book here.  Be open and honest.  What happened to the crossing guard job?  Okay.  I'm probably going to get in trouble for that.  All right.  No.  No.  Well, there was one time.  Okay.  I called in sick a couple of times.  Yeah.  Because you had too much free time in between.  She's lying.  All right.  No, I'm not.  I'm not.  Well, you're not what?  All right.  I used to call in sick.  I called in sick too much, and they got tired of it, and they let me go. 
[04:14:30]  But why is Bill saying, don't say it?  Yeah.  Well, that's what he did not want me to say.  Why?  Because I called in sick too many times.  I had too much free time in between.  And why were you calling in sick for an easy job?  Oh, I guarantee you she was getting drunk after the morning shift.  She was getting drunk.  And couldn't.  No, no, no, no, no, no, no.  I just called in sick because sometimes it was winter time and everything like that, and  I just didn't feel like going out there and stuff like that, and they just got sick  of it.  So, basically, you were a lazy lump that couldn't go out twice a day. 
[04:15:00]  You just wanted to sit in the house on your big fat ass and do nothing.  I don't have a big fat ass.  Yeah, you don't.  God.  That I can guarantee.  You do.  That means you have a very long back.  Oh, man.  Yeah, very long back.  Thanks a lot, Jim.  But I think that you're just languishing in this horrible place in your life.  I don't, hold on a second.  I don't have a flat ass.  Did Bill say you had a flat ass?  Oh, he just did.  He just said that.  Bill rules.  Yeah, we love Bill. 
[04:15:30]  That's why Bill fucks your face.  He doesn't want to look at the back of you.  Bill just said you have a flat ass.  No, no, no.  He doesn't.  No, we don't do that.  We don't do that.  You admitted it last phone call.  You admitted last time that he comes in your mouth.  Stop it.  That he fucking ejaculates in that face of yours.  I didn't want to shut you guys up.  You gobble it down like custard.  Yeah.  Oh, yeah, I do.  Oh, my God.  You're just, oh, Jesus.  I'm going to be sick.  What?  Yeah.  Another 8,000 times you might be human.  Okay.  Yeah. 
[04:16:00]  Puke.  Marion and I miss you guys.  Oh, good for you.  What do you do?  They should do her hair.  They should give her the old JFK.  We'll see you next Friday, okay?  Oh, great.  Looking forward to it.  I got pissed anyway.  All right, so, uh...  We heard you.  You'll see us Friday.  Yes, Friday.  How long do you have to wrap a call up for?  I'll see you Friday.  Friday.  Goodbye.  Next Friday.  See you next Friday.  Okay.  Take care.  All right.  You too.  Bye-bye.  Bye-bye.  Bye.  Wait. 
[04:16:30]  What a fucking moose.  Dude, that was a time machine call.  Yes.  That was like we went back in time.  I just heard it.  And there she was.  Michael, that's the same shit.  And then he found the clip.  Yes.  Holy fuck.  And, and, Iraq, you probably didn't even have to really look for that one.  That was the beginning.  For that one.  Yeah.  I was just looking for Lady Di Call.  Right.  And then skim through it.  Oh, there it is.  And it's going to be the same call.  It was exact, except our voices were certainly a bit different. 
[04:17:00]  Yes.  There was a little more exuberance in my voice.  A little more hope.  A little more exuberance.  A little more exuberance.  Exuberance.  Some youthful exuberance.  That's the only difference in that phone call from today.  A bit of exuberance.  What a disaster that woman is.  Her whole life.  God.  Yeah.  All right.  That's it for the worst of 2013.  So far.  So far.  So far.  The rest of 2013 starts Monday morning at 6 a.m. Eastern when ONA return live on the OPN News Channel. </pre>
