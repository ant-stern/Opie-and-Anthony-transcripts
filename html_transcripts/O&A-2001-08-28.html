<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast covered a wide range of topics, beginning with Opie's horrifying experience at a Midtown Manhattan hotel, which he dubbed the "Crack Hotel."  He detailed a sleepless night spent sweating on a bare mattress due to ill-fitting sheets and dirty clothes, resorting to rinsing his underwear and airing out his clothes with the air conditioning. This was juxtaposed with a *New York Post* article celebrating their radio success, highlighting the stark contrast between their professional achievements and Opie's squalid hotel room.  The description of the room included graphic details of its unsanitary conditions and speculation about the previous occupants' activities, focusing on bodily fluids and the risk of STDs.

The show then transitioned to a phone interview with Jonathan Harris, the actor who played Dr. Zachary Smith on *Lost in Space*.  The interview was highly unusual and sexually suggestive, with Harris making inappropriate comments about his interactions with the young boy actor, William Mumy, blurring the lines between his character and his real life.  His responses were rambling and filled with innuendo.

Returning to Opie and Anthony, the hosts discussed listener calls and shared derogatory anecdotes about their former general manager, Bruce Mittman.  They recounted several PR disasters, including a failed pie-throwing stunt with the mayor and a subsequent, ill-advised visit to a children's cancer hospital to deliver pies, highlighting their subsequent realization of their insensitive actions.  The discussion was filled with offensive language and crude humor.

A later segment recounted a prior incident where they were asked to participate in a photo opportunity with dying children as a PR stunt to save their jobs.  They refused, viewing the situation as exploitative, a decision which ultimately led to their firingâ€”a consequence they later considered positive.

A significant portion of the show focused on an intern, "Ryan," who arrived at the studio with a large bandage and eyepatch, claiming a motorcycle accident.  After intense questioning by the hosts, studio guests (including adult film actress Cassidy), and callers, Ryan admitted to fabricating the extent of his injuries. This was followed by a description of his (lack of) injuries and his increasingly uncomfortable attempts to maintain the deception.  The segment also included a Cancun trip contest won by Wendy for participating in a bizarre on-air act with Marco, which involved a visibly distressed and unsuccessful attempt by Marco to perform a sexual act with her. The segment concluded with Ryan's dismissal.

Another segment featured a coworker, Brian, who called in sick claiming a motorcycle accident resulting in head and eye injuries. Upon arrival, his lack of visible injuries led to intense questioning about his history of fabricating illnesses and injuries, including a previous claim of head surgery (later revealed to be ankle surgery).  A studio vote on whether he should go home ended in a tie, with the final decision left to listeners.  Brian was eventually sent home, but his employment status remained unresolved.

Finally, a caller, Keith, recounted a childhood incident where he unexpectedly witnessed his parents having sex in an unusual position, prompting further sexually suggestive dialogue among the hosts.  This was followed by a call from Keith's mother, who shared a similar story involving Keith's cousin, further escalating the sexually explicit and humorous tone of the conversation.

[00:34:00]  i think it should be good enough uh well let me do one more i'm in the bathroom with the silent phone  uh oh did you hear that yes i hear you oh oh oh oh wow this is exhilarating 
[00:34:30]  now the station for sports guys don and mike opie and anthony and ron and fezz is this station  1027 wnew new york  and when we did the uh we stood out in the driving range at the golf course we dressed up in like 
[00:35:00]  hockey equipment and uh and other stuff and stood out on the driving range with about would you consider  this uh the wackiest fits you've ever done we try not to do wacky fits this was uh probably one of  the zaniest things we've done yes a little wacky for us but it was cool it was for like a charity  you know what and this was before jackass and we have video yeah that they would play on mtv 
[00:35:30]  tomorrow because it was pretty sick but i remember i was so uh scared of getting hit in the junk  that um i took a big steel frying pan and duct taped it right over my crotch and i will never forget  the sound it made and the the the relief i felt when one of the shots a line shot man right off  the frying pan it made a bong sound i looked down and saw when i had a duct tape that hit the duct  tape and made like a hole in the duct tape where the golf ball hit and it was right where my sack was 
[00:36:00]  now you guys don't understand how scary this was we were in full like hockey goalie gear frying pans on  our junk we had every inch of our body uh covered with chest arms heavy heavy pads  we stood about 100 to 120 yards away and we had had to be 50 guys i was gonna say like 40 all right  40 or 50 guys all hitting golf balls at the same time at us and some of them real ringers i mean that  could slam these balls the line shots that just stay five feet off the ground for 200 yards 
[00:36:30]  all those things that just whoo they defy gravity you see it coming at you but it's coming so fast  there's no way you can move and and and it hits you and you're just convinced you're dead yeah no  joke you're like oh my i'm done then you're amazed and then you're like wow that didn't hurt it's  it's really bizarre the first one that hits you you're all scared and stuff and then the first one  that hits you like oh wow that didn't hurt but is it going to hurt when it hits me on the kneecap or  so yeah yeah yeah what about the ones that would just whiz by our head oh yeah and you would hear 
[00:37:00]  the sound of oh my god it's pie fighter  yeah that was pretty scary though maybe we'll have to pull something wacky out like that again  op i don't know how wacky it is because it was really scary yeah it was fun for the people that  were doing it and there were times we got hit it knocked us right over like boom we were yeah we 
[00:37:30]  were you know knocked right over do it again we must do it again yeah we can do it again we did it for  charity it was for a good cause we raised a lot of money yeah and it was like i said it was fun for  the people that were doing it i mean if you're if you're at a driving range what would be more fun than  aiming at people yeah really you know who hasn't taken shots at the poor ball collector guy  in the the little cage uh golf cart and remember we started like 200 yards out because even though 
[00:38:00]  we were like you know had all this padding on scared we were still scared and then and i we got  a little braver we kept moving up moving up and we got about a hundred 110 yards away was our closest  and it was just insane insane it's so funny when you take a shot on the uh take a shot on the course  and um you see your balls going to somebody stupid thing to yell oh how about look out  oh yes the thing's just going right for them and they're just standing there and you see the whole 
[00:38:30]  thing happening that lands a foot away from them they give you that what the f look horrible they  either step on your ball and hit it back to you yeah yeah i'm really terrible at it so i don't know  where the ball is going i don't know where it's going after i hit it so just say hey look out jeff  what's up hey guys i'd pay some good money to knock a few balls at you that'd be hysterical yeah it was  you called uh what was it take a shot at opie and anthony yeah because we take a shot at everyone  else was yeah it was the gag your chance to get revenge you could do it like you know 50 bucks 
[00:39:00]  for gay marco you know 100 bucks for stinky you know 500 bucks for you guys yeah i would consider  doing it again it was scary but i would do it again and those shots five feet off the ground worm  burners yeah i know vicious thanks jeff take it easy guys okay wait a second you mean in boston  charity actually accepted donations from your show yeah how's that for a topper it's from saril  that's someone that pays attention oh how's that for a popper it's charities usually don't take our 
[00:39:30]  money which amazes me i mean we've talked about it just amazes me yeah and you want to try to  do free money we try to do a charity no one ever wants our money so screw it now we uh just go out  and have fun like our road show is coming up really fast when when we were putting out the  menu world and we had a part of charity and what was it the jimmy fund ben ben jimmy fund who solicits  uh donations in movie theaters i mean uh we you'd be sitting in a movie waiting for the movie to start 
[00:40:00]  the lights would come up someone walks in front of the theater and goes hi i'm blah blah blah from the  jimmy fund uh we're going to send a couple of people to walk around uh to guilt you into using your  remaining jujube money to uh help cure uh jimmy right so we contacted jimmy fund and yeah we were  we were just floored that they wouldn't take our money so we started calling other charities in boston  no one would take our money nope to make a long story short demented world if you look closely on 
[00:40:30]  the labeling of our cd that's like three years old now the charity we finally found was the minority  homeless veterans veterans association not even the homeless vets it was the minority  homeless vets minority home of boston of boston it's not even up for new york no they got how  many minorities in boston they got all the money they got all the money because that was the only 
[00:41:00]  charity that would take it and the check presenting um ceremony right with our boss we we didn't have to  go but uh yeah we we sold a ton of the cds and it was time to you know pay the minority homeless  veterans of boston the big check the big check so our gm at the time bruce mittman has to go down to  their uh their their their local headquarters present that five foot by two foot big photo op check now he 
[00:41:30]  was pissed off at us at the time for something i don't remember we were getting in a lot of trouble  back then we just never got it back then especially so so we're doing our radio show and we'll and the  bruce mittman comes walking into the uh the studio with the big check and he goes i don't know why i'm  doing this for you guys but i gotta present this check to a bunch of shwuggies oh when he said that i 
[00:42:00]  lost it and the picture of the boys but here's this little jewish guy i swear to god he's three feet  tall the picture it's out there somewhere i don't think it made the main papers but like a local paper  yeah there's a picture of uh our midget gm because he was like like anthony said about five two five  three sitting there putting on a fake smile uh surrounded by a bunch of shwuggies as he's holding  the paycheck these are like some ancient tuskegee airmen pilots that are just like family going i 
[00:42:30]  remember back on p51 i was getting on a mustang when all of a sudden me and our squadron of shwuggies  swept down on the goddamn drivers i'm black air for the future let me tell you about it we win the war  and and and there's this three-foot little jewish guy going boys boys i don't know how i get stuck  presenting the check to the shwuggies but i will never forget that word hey it was boston everyone  talks about screen name up for grabs today shwuggie shwuggie i don't even know how do you how do you 
[00:43:00]  spell boys boys my shwuggie that guy was that guy was classic man  let me tell you something i remember a storm of the beaches the guy would just like we'd have  these just rocking shows with corn and limp biscuits he'd be backstage smoking pot with us  this guy was the most like business guys but he was a midget and he drove this big friggin suburban  he had the biggest car in boston because because he was so short and we used to joke on the air that 
[00:43:30]  he needed a stepladder to get into it and stuff yeah you see the door open and one of those rope  ladders unroll no joke because he looked ridiculous behind this uh behind the wheel of this uh truck  yeah and then uh at the at the shows because we used to do a lot of the parties with the the bands  and stuff up there corn plated a few and stuff and there's brucey just partying it up like a madman  with everybody hey boys how you doing any pot boys boys that's what he calls boys boys uh have you 
[00:44:00]  seen ozone i need some pot boys boys he lived in the nicest town yeah he lived in a really like snootin  highfalutin area where there were no shwuggies at all no no shwuggies here he is  oh oh i'll never forget him walking into that studio that day with a big check i gotta present  this check to the shwuggies is that horrid he definitely sounded like ted knight we gotta bring 
[00:44:30]  it to the shwuggies right is that clear uh carl what's up hey i know where the uh term four came  from uh i said i don't know about shwuggie but i can tell you where four came from yeah he used to  work at a golf course during college with this old scottish guy who's kind of like that mctavish  from caddyshack yeah he says the scots used to no yeah that's right you know that go for it go for 
[00:45:00]  denny he used to fire cannons when they'd fight between the clans and before they'd shoot them  they'd yell before the cannons so the guys would duck after a while they got tired of yelling before  the cannons they just said four of the cannons and then finally they said four then they stopped  shooting at each other and started playing golf and yelled four so not a lot of yucks but that's  exactly what how about that you know in those days they called it golf without the l goth without the l 
[00:45:30]  i haven't seen that movie i haven't seen that movie in two weeks it was given to me right by the knights  of st andrews but i got it from a negro i got it from a shwuggie it looks like i'm a wreck it's in the hole  uh let's go to steve a lot of steve's checking in today steve what's going on yeah i'm laughing  my ass off over here the proper pronunciation for that word the yiddish derivative of that is shwuggie 
[00:46:00]  shwuggie yeah yeah shwuggie but he would be shwuggie shwuggie yeah um it's a yiddish word basically  the best uh interpretation it means shadow slang word for black man i gotta give this big check  boys to the shadows yeah you guys will take care the shwuggies you know we never told that story on  the air because brucey was unbelievable yeah because here we are doing a nice thing for the minority  homeless vets of boston what about the time we had a meet with the gay guys we had a meeting with 
[00:46:30]  three guys from the gay lesbian uh you know glad or whatever and because of some of the gay oriented  uh things we were doing on the show what gave it oh i know a gay bit can we play the bit which one was  it hi mom i'm gay hi mom i'm gay all right hold on mom hold on rope swallow and we'll take a break  we'll take a break we'll get into that story and uh bruce's uh name for the uh for the gay guys  oh there was another group we had to meet with we were always meeting with groups but he's like 
[00:47:00]  i know but boys we have to meet with the faggots he's trying to make it seem like it's this big  thing faggots i just hope there's no shwuggie faggot all right we'll tell that story next stay there  and play hi mom i'm gay okay where were we talking about uh i don't know how we got on that but 
[00:47:30]  talking about our old uh gm brucey mittman and all the meetings we just have to take with certain uh  groups back when we were up in boston  the fagolas the schmuggies all the groups behind closed doors though it was hilarious  the fact that we needed uh the only charity we could find was the uh minority homeless veterans  of boston to give money to because no one else the jimmy fund didn't want our money didn't want 
[00:48:00]  our stinking money to help kids with cancer they'll solicit movie theaters so you could throw uh your  popcorn money into a can but they didn't want a hundred thousand dollars from opium anthony  blood money like taking it from uh terrorists so um yeah we got the uh minority homeless vets of boston  on board and when we finally got the uh money to give them from cd sales a substantial sum we sent our 
[00:48:30]  gm over there we were busy that day to uh give them the the big check the big photo op check hey  look at that and he said there's a shot of us in our little uh goalie gear oh yeah let me see that on  the inside cover of the mental world let's see those pictures and he said uh why do i have to go and give  the check to the schwoogies the schwoogies schwoogies after we were on the air you know telling everyone  how how nice we were and how cool we are because we're raising money for the minority homeless vets and  then behind closed doors he was pissed and telling us right he had to deliver the check to the schwoogies 
[00:49:00]  yeah there we are in our hockey outfit with the frying pan let's see you can see the frying pan taped to  my crotch area all right anyway anthony i i i remembered the third story by the way oh you did  two words what cancer kids oh no not a funny story but uh we'll explain in a minute god first we have 
[00:49:30]  it was uh bruce mittman's idea of getting us out of some serious trouble yeah go hang out with cancer  kids that'll make everyone love us see if we have a photo op and use more children hold on go to the gay  thing first and then we'll get into cancer kids well we were uh we'll finish up the the segment on our  old gm bruce mittman the midget and we did um we did hi mom i'm gay simple game a guy calls up his

[00:54:00]  the guy isn't gonna take up much of your time boys the the homo faggot queer should be leaving well  before showtime boys so then you fast forward another half hour we're now in in the boss's  office with uh the gay guys the gay guys and and the boss with his arms folded looking at us like  he's pissed yeah so he's got to look like he's all aggravated with us as the gay guys and we're  sitting there like you son of a bitch ten minutes ago you're calling faggots the gay guys are handing  us pamphlets and books about dittos all kinds of reading material about how hard it is to come out of 
[00:54:30]  the closet remember they wanted us uh to read a book i forgot that i forgot but it was like bernie's  story yeah yeah it was about him coming out of the closet book we're like we're not reading books  we're gonna read this oh you think we're actually gonna sit and read it but then but we were just  sitting there all dopey uh okay yeah we'll get through this all right thank you thank you goodbye  and finally we just said look we gotta go it's time to leave and brucey gets up thank you so much 
[00:55:00]  for enlightening us on the trials and tribulations of homosexuality and the various hardships one  must endure and the boys are now more sensitive to the fact i believe they're more educated thanks  for coming by and enlightening enlightening my boys okay goodbye goodbye okay there the bunghole  pirate's gone boys you can now go back on the air please lay off the fags today maybe hit the schwoogies  you know you boys never in trouble with the specs i'm very proud uh boy nick what's going on yeah 
[00:55:30]  you guys got this guy on tape the guy i gotta hear this guy's voice now the guy did our show a couple  times in new york in new york when we first got here uh he came into new york to do some business  and we had him on the air and he's like oh how are my boys i wish i would have heard him boy we'll try  to dig up some tape of him all right thanks guys all right buddy bye boys some gooks are calling 
[00:56:00]  complaining about some of your various asian bits you know as we were kind of getting our thoughts  together during commercials and i'm thinking about it and things are coming back to my memory that i  blocked out because this was just one of those things that i didn't want to be part of it was  horrible we walked out we walked out we did walk out after they brought billy little billy all  right all right little billy stop it we we showed we had hearts that day oh we finally reached our 
[00:56:30]  limit like boys boys he was always trying to uh run block for us in his own inimitable little way  the little midget and he would be all pc in front of the person but then he turned around and you  know call them shoogies or faggots the faggots have left boys you can resume bashing the faggots well  we finally come to the uh the famous prank yeah when we did that mayor thing said the mayor was dead and 
[00:57:00]  we were on the verge of getting fired we didn't get fired that day it went a good week before they  actually fired us so in that week um brucey is trying to do damage control now this it's not  working the mayor was so pissed off uh but they came up with this idea well you got to tell everyone  that uh they hired hired a pr firm yeah they hired a pr firm just for this to try to put out the fire 
[00:57:30]  look good to make us look good and put out the fire so we could keep our jobs and continue rocking  boston now if you remember um opie when when we got uh in trouble brucey and dada dave got together  and decided that they were going to approach the mayor mayor menino and say look the same mayor that  we just told everyone died in a car accident april fools look we'll go into um boston put the boys in  those stocks those old stocks where you put your head and your arms through and you're locked in there 
[00:58:00]  and the mayor that we said was dead will throw pies at the boy's face and everything will be  okay after that and then that's fine this is the idea that dada dave came up with so that's all  okie dokie he told he told the midget look i can handle this i got a great way to get us out of this  great way to get us out of trouble yeah okay we had news crews camping outside our residence  yeah and this is going to take care of it just a uh a bunch of our listeners and and the mayor  throwing pies at our faces we're in a stockade so get to this to get this before they even check with 
[00:58:30]  the mayor or us or anything dada dave goes and orders about 500 pies 500 big cream real pies not  not whipped cream and tin foil pie tins well real he wanted us to get hurt they were like big lemon  meringue pies apple pies the reason why the uh the old pie gag works is because all it is is whipped  cream yeah but he no real pies he's gonna throw real pies at us 500 pies he orders so now we get 
[00:59:00]  on the air when we find out about this yeah the next day i just gotta jump in because we didn't  really get fired april 1st we did the show we were on the next day april 2nd april 2nd we start getting  wind of this pie scheme so we go off and say we're not doing this we are not going to go in stocks and  have pies thrown at us by anybody dave comes running in all pissed off you don't tell me what  you're gonna do i'm trying to get uh damage control here this is off the air he starts yelling at us 
[00:59:30]  i'm trying to help you guys out and do damage control you don't get on the air and say you're  not doing this and you're so tame oh he was screaming you don't do that it was because  i said so all raging pissed off 500 pies you are it was davy it was davy dearest davy dearest because  he was he was screaming in that you'll get hit with these pies he was because he was screaming in 
[01:00:00]  that same cadence yeah brucey get the pies and you know what it i have that audio on it dad somewhere  somewhere and to this day i cannot find it it drives me nuts probably the most valuable piece of tape  since uh the nixon watergate tape without a doubt and i will find it eventually yeah but uh but before  you move on with the story yeah now uh if we back up here we told you guys that they hired a pr firm  right the midget bruce mitman who loves the swiggy so boys boys remember what he did to the mayor 
[01:00:30]  he looked up the mayor's schedule yeah because it was all about damage control and then putting out  the fires so bruce mitman figures if he could get a picture of himself shaking the mayor's hand  all right because what the pr firm does is they have their no this is a true story they have their  own you know camera camera crew and stuff so they'll go to events take pictures and then they'll put  it they'll put in the paper this story was so hot it was it was he hired basically paparazzi 
[01:01:00]  yes because i because i mean any paper in the new england area would would buy this photo of the  general manager of the station that just pulled the most amazing sickest ridiculous prank shaking  the mayor's hand oh it was gold so freaking the midget finds out um the mayor's schedule i'm looking  up the mayor's schedule boys i will fix this for you the fat dago will uh be very happy so he camps 
[01:01:30]  out where the mayor is going to do an appearance or whatever whatever he was doing i forget exactly  the mayor comes out of his little meeting there's bruce mitman runs right up to him  and there's the paparazzi even though it was a pr firm but it was a paparazzi guy going  snapping pictures like crazy yes it was in all the boston papers the next day yeah bruce mitman  shaking the hand of the mayor which infuriated the mayor infuriated because the mayor had no  idea who the midget was he thought he was just shaking a shaking uh you know uh uh just a regular 
[01:02:00]  schmo's hand he thought i was welcoming him to munchkin land boys boys boys so that that infuriated  the mayor as well so then um so now um they they finally checked dada dave now calls the mayor's  office and says i have 500 pies i have the boys we're gonna do this right and the mayor's office  just goes are you out of your effing mind do you think we're just gonna take our anger with with 
[01:02:30]  them and what they did and how they hurt the mayor's family and turn it into some wacky  radio stunt prank thing no take your pies and shove them up your ass that's pretty much  what they said yeah so now 500 pies ordered opium anthony in trouble damage control not working pr firm  pr firm phase two now right okay we'll take uh lemons make lemonade we got 500 pies what can we do with 
[01:03:00]  500 pies we'll send opium anthony to the children's cancer hospital to deliver the pies to the little  dying children like that's what a great photo effing op mother effort that's that yeah that's what dying  kids want pies so now we're going to use kids with cancer to try to make it so oma can keep their goddamn  jobs right and we were so you know we got to say it we were so shell-shocked we kind of just went with  it we were going wherever they said at that point we're just what yeah okay every every hour they're 
[01:03:30]  running promos on the news of updates on where we are what we're doing how does the mayor feel when are  they're going to get fired are they fired who knows this is our lives and we're we're just like  freaking out we were like stepford djs we were just oh okay all right whatever the flow and we really  didn't know what they were doing they go just be at this hospital at this time there's going to be a  photographer there so we're like okay they didn't tell us about uh uh the cancer hospital i think all  right there's a kid with a broken leg we'll shove a pie in his arm and we'll leave right i don't know 
[01:04:00]  we go there this stuff is done all the time by the way by these pr oh yeah when you see some schlep  jock standing there with uh you know hugging uh a little crack babies you think he wakes up and goes  well i think i'm gonna go hug some crack babies today no that guy has a story to tell and he's  trying to get himself out of some trouble right so in most cases i'm sure there's there's good-hearted  souls we go to this hospital there's the truck 500 pies and in the truck and they start bringing them in 
[01:04:30]  they start bringing in the pies we're in the lobby of the hospital now that now that the the people  that worked at the cancer hospital they didn't know the whole story they really didn't know who  we were at this point no they they really thought that you and i and the radio station was doing a  good deed that's all they knew at first now we're standing around waiting for the photographers  right and the um they got the pies just high loaded all the way up to the ceiling pies as far as the  photo op goes it was it was quite impressive so so now they go okay let's start bringing the 
[01:05:00]  children in right like all right so like i said i had a broken leg at this point we still think it's  just a regular oh look at that little mary just got her tonsils taken out how cute hopefully you can  enjoy the the lemon meringue but you can't eat the crust your throat still hurts they start wheeling out  kids with the the clumps of hair coming out the baldy heads look look is that dude we're not telling  the story for a joke this no this is what we have yet so i'm looking at open like oh my god these these 
[01:05:30]  are dying kids no no no no no but i got it back we did not know at first we're still thinking well  okay they're in bad shape no i'm looking and in my head i'm thinking oh my god they're dying kids i'll  tell you when i found out when all of a sudden even though this was uh like april 5th or so  okay all the kids are around the pie stacked up to the ceiling we're waiting for we're still waiting  for the photographer that was the reason we waited right um and all of a sudden there's little mary 
[01:06:00]  oh yeah looking just like cindy loohoo and she's like the the leader of the cancer kids yeah and all  sudden they're like little little impish little uh kid sure little cute kid so cute okay and and and  you look at her you're like oh it doesn't seem like anything's wrong and they go mary uh why don't you  sing a song you think the rendition of ziggy doing silent night is beautiful this girl like an angel 
[01:06:30]  song and all the cares of kids joining in right it was a cancer uh kid choir yes yeah so she's like in  this this voice from heaven and i'm really getting into it like wow that's kind of cool you know yeah  all of a sudden one of the the helpers the nurses or whatever oh no bends over to me and whispers in 
[01:07:00]  my ear goes you know mary's not going to see christmas because it was april all right what happened i was  just talking to her she was just singing you're kidding mary's not going to see christmas so i look at  it i think at this point seriously i turn white as a ghost like what the f are we doing here yeah  yeah they're there and now all the cancer kids are are are looking at uh aunt and i like we're 
[01:07:30]  heroes because we brought all these pies we brought a bunch of pies and we're like we're we're not this  we're not this nice we're not nice we're not doing this out of the kindness of our hearts we're using  these kids we were thrown into the situation did not know and they think we're heroes and we're like  we are scumbags to use kids like this to try to save our our necks the station puts this goddamn  thing together now we're still waiting for the photographer right and um then the nurses go no  and i don't mean to laugh i'm laughing because i'm uncomfortable because i don't want to be known as 
[01:08:00]  a dick for this story because this is this is an insane story the nurses go okay why don't we get billy  so it's like what well why isn't billy why didn't billy get wheeled out or walk out or use the crutches  and come out with the rest of the kids why don't we get billy it was sort of like  get the gimp the gimp sleep no no he was the only kid that wasn't there we're like why isn't billy 
[01:08:30]  there suddenly i hear a low hum down the hallway here comes billy's electric it wasn't even a wheelchair  i don't know what this was it was a rolling platform it was like a wheelchair with just a head  hooked up to tubes and wires and other devices to keep little billy alive and the reason he didn't  join the kids in the beginning the cancer kids is because basically you know he only can muster up  enough energy to maybe be awake for five minutes he's like your cell phone's nicad you know you don't 
[01:09:00]  want to keep it on all the time you just want to turn it on when you got to use it or the battery  real now they bring uh yeah we're a little billy and billy down the hall now it's complete the smile  on the kid's face i'm like holy at this point we're like so you got to go through it well the  photographers get there and uh me and opie start having a conference we're like this is the wrongest  thing we have never done anything so wrong because on the radio when you're talking yeah we say stuff 
[01:09:30]  that's really off the wall and wrong but then to just be directly involved in something like this  they are using the dying children to take a photo op with us to try to in some way spin it in the paper  that we're good guys right and should keep our jobs right so we just turned around and said no this  ain't it and uh we walked walked took our pies too little kids didn't get no we left the pie and the 
[01:10:00]  kids didn't know we walked we like no no we were like goodbye look like here you go we're presenting  these pies yeah and that was all all fine and well but uh it was so depressing and and then we were so  friggin pissed at them for putting us in this position at uh management and the the pr firm that  we just went you know something you guys do whatever you want we're not doing another thing if we get  fired we get fired effort and they got mad at us because we walked because we walked we missed the 
[01:10:30]  little photo op to use the dying children to try to save our necks that's like just gunfire breaks  out you pick up little billy's head and try to block the shots that's what it was like  it was little billy's still alive by the way he's on the phone billy it was horrible it was  and of course the story ends we did get fired yeah and it was the best thing that ever happened and we 
[01:11:00]  took it best thing that ever happened boys boys i'll try to hire you back boys  why didn't you take pictures with the cancer kids boys boys why not take pictures with those little  dying craps proofing all right cool let's uh let's try to end on a note too late the station for sports  guys don and mike obi and anthony and ron and fez is this station 1027 wnew new york

[01:23:00]  J.C.  And talk to Wendy for a second.  Wendy, how are you doing?  There was contact.  I'm getting nervous.  He's making me nervous.  It's not about you, baby.  It's about him.  Now, Opie, no, something didn't happen like that.  Oh, no?  It didn't.  There was never contact.  Oh, okay.  Okay.  Oh, my God.  I've never actually seen such struggle with a girl pulling a guy's head.  You see it the other way around sometimes, but you never...  Okay.  Okay.  All right.  The song is going to start, Marco.  You've got to loosen up.  She's pulling on your head like, I don't know what. 
[01:23:30]  Any guy would be dying right now, Marco.  Look at those t-  Marco, you're so gay.  Wait, wait, wait, wait.  Marco, you're so gay.  Thank you.  Yes, Marco.  All right.  Is the song ready again?  Yes, yes.  All right.  Here we go.  Take two.  Let it rip.  And we have contact.  Oh, my God.  He's doing it.  All right.  Wait.  Mike Wendy, because she's making some bizarre faces. 
[01:24:00]  Wait.  Wait.  Wait.  Wait.  Wait.  Oh, my God.  Okay.  Oh, my God.  Wendy, what's going on?  Oh, my God.  This is so weird.  Is it working?  No, it's not working.  No, no.  Keep going, Marco.  All right.  Let's see.  Side to side.  Side to side.  She's like, she's got her head going back and forth like, no, no.  This is awful.  Look how I get her. 
[01:24:30]  Talk to Wendy.  Talk to Wendy.  Wendy, how you doing?  He's doing a wonderful job.  No, no.  No, no.  And two and a half minutes to go.  No audio coming from the area.  Two and a half minutes to go.  Wait.  Wendy, is he still doing it?  He's doing it.  Yeah, Marco, don't just keep your head down there.  You've got to work it.  Don't just stare at it.  There he goes.  Wendy, why are you, like, freaking out so much?  What is he doing in particular that's so freaking out?  He's so gay. 
[01:25:00]  He wasn't?  He wasn't?  It's so gay.  I asked him what was the problem.  He goes, it's so gay.  Keep going, Marco.  You're almost there.  Two minutes.  Two minutes to go.  He's coughing.  He's coughing.  Tell us what he's doing wrong.  He's coughing or crying or something.  Marco, almost there.  Keep going.  Keep going.  You can do it.  You can do it.  What's he doing wrong?  He's coughing.  He's coughing.  He's coughing.  He's coughing.  Keep going, Marco.  You're almost there. 
[01:25:30]  It's almost done.  His legs are flailing.  It's as if someone was chopping his head off.  You okay?  What is the difference between good and what he's doing?  Good actually makes me smile.  Like, for real.  This is freaking you out.  Maybe if you grab the back of his head, he'll do a little better.  And he's shaking his head.  No.  I've got to see if he's doing this right.  You get your head in there, my friend.  I sit there. 
[01:26:00]  All right.  You tell us if he stops.  How much longer?  How much longer?  We're at the one minute warning.  One minute, Marco.  One minute, Marco.  You're all man.  You're all man.  You're all man.  Look at this gay guy go.  He's doing push-ups or something.  Is he getting better as time goes on?  No, he's getting worse.  He's getting worse.  Marco, say something.  Marco, how are you doing?  No, keep going.  You're all up there.  Say something.  Don't lose contact.  Don't we start over.  Say something. 
[01:26:30]  Hum.  Hum or do something.  All right.  You seem to have settled down.  Let's go.  Don't breathe.  30 seconds, Marco.  30 seconds.  The song's almost over.  J.C.  Think J.C.  Marco, J.C.  Is this the worst you've ever had?  I can't even explain this right now.  5, 4, 3, 2, 1.  Marco, you did it.  Marco, you did it. 
[01:27:00]  Marco, you did it.  Marco, how does it feel?  Marco, how does it feel?  I'm doing this thing.  Look at him crying on the floor.  He's crying on the floor.  He's got a little biff on and it's in fink shirt.  He's in the fetal position.  Marco, you did it.  Marco.  Was that the worst ever?  That was so bad.  All right, they're putting alcoids in his mouth.  I can't even describe it.  Very bad.  Marco? 
[01:27:30]  Not a hint of pleasure.  No.  Marco.  Marco.  Is he coming to you yet?  Marco?  Marco?  He's still on the floor.  He's breathing heavy.  It's over.  You're doing good.  Very good, Marco.  Marco?  And then right when he came away, he took his I Love Daddy bib and just wiped his face with  it crying.  You all right there, Marco?  Yeah.  Let's not forget that Wendy had her friend.  Yes.  Yes.  Marco?  Yeah.  He's crying. 
[01:28:00]  Marco.  Why are you crying?  Are you okay?  I'm okay.  Wait, he's really crying.  You all right?  I'm fine.  You all right?  Yep.  How was it for you?  Wait, are you crying because of what you just did or because you just won the NSYNC ticket?  Both.  Oh, my God.  It's okay, Marco.  Guys would have loved doing what you were just doing there.  It was awful.  Oh, my God.  What was the most horrible thing about it, Marco?  The tape.  Oh, no.  Now, Wendy, don't let this be a reflection on you. 
[01:28:30]  He is a gay man.  You know, he likes things like Man A, you know, so we really got to keep things in perspective  here.  It just tasted so weird.  So weird?  Yes.  From a guy that likes Man A.  Look at him.  Well, Marco, let me present to you two tickets to NSYNC at the Continental Arena.  Congratulations.  I hope that makes it a little easier for you.  Oh, yes.  Yes, it does. 
[01:29:00]  Thank you so much.  Oh, that's the funniest thing you've ever seen.  It was the best thing we've ever seen.  Oh, my God.  He's sweating.  He's beat red.  He's tearing.  Horrified.  Are you all right, Marco?  I'm going to be fine.  Did you start getting into it at all?  No.  No?  It was just horrible.  And, Wendy, you were saying it was not pleasurable at all.  No.  Someone get Marco a banana.  Now, for a guy, even a bad one is kind of good.  Sure.  Just because it's happening?  But that wasn't even happening?  It was just because it was really weird because he's so really gay. 
[01:29:30]  The gayness came through in his...  If I didn't know he was gay, it probably wouldn't have been as bad, but because he is, and I  definitely take that into consideration why...  He's a trooper, though, because he did it the whole time, man.  He did.  He didn't come up for air once.  Not once.  I almost puked.  Well, that's good.  Again, Wendy, no reflection on you.  You've got to remember where it's coming from.  Well, Marco's got the in-sync tickets, and Wendy has a trip for two to Cancun, Mexico, 
[01:30:00]  courtesy of EastStudentTravel.com.  Wow.  Congratulations to everybody.  Beautiful job.  The number one student travel service in America, EastStudentTravel.com.  Now, let's go to our house porn star.  Oh, adult film actress.  I'm sorry.  Cassidy, 19 years old.  Cassidy, you witnessed the whole thing.  How did that rate with some of the porn star actors that you've seen working the same area?  That was pretty sad.  Oh, I love Wendy.  A little kiss on the cheek, and he is even more disgusted. 
[01:30:30]  Unbelievable.  Marco, any final thoughts?  Yeah.  No.  Was that the worst thing you've ever, ever done in your life?  Yes.  Wow.  Was that the worst thing ever done to you, Wendy?  Yes, definitely.  No doubt about it.  All right.  Our mission is done here.  Okay, great.  Bravo.  Okay, terrific.  Thank you very much, all involved.  You're going in sync.  There you go.  All right, why don't we take a break, and we'll be back.  The station for sports guys, Don and Mike, Obey and Anthony, and Ron and Fez is 
[01:31:00]  this station, 1027 WNAW, New York.  Under the patch and said there's nothing wrong with the story.  What happened to you?  Yeah, what happened?  I got hit by a motorcycle.  You look completely ridiculous.  You got hit by a motorcycle?  Yes.  But not you personally, your car?  My car.  Okay, so you're driving.  Driving, making a left-hand turn.  You're making a left.  And the motorcycle decides I'm going left to me.  He decides to do what?  To pass on my left.  Oh, to pass on your left?  Yes.  So you're making a left, he's passing you on the left,  and he runs into what? 
[01:31:30]  My driver's side.  Your driver's side door?  Mm-hmm.  So what happens?  Wait.  Oh, okay.  My head goes through my driver's side window.  Oh, it did?  Yes.  How fast was he going?  I don't know.  22 miles an hour.  Mm-hmm.  And you're making your left?  Yes.  And he hits your door, your head goes through the window?  Mm-hmm.  Okay.  Yes.  So you hit your head, and what happened to your eye?  Glass got in it.  Glass in your eye.  And what happened underneath that patch on your head?  That's where my head went through the windshield.  What kind of injury? 
[01:32:00]  Just a couple scrapes.  A couple of scrapes.  Yeah, so no.  Hard head.  Anything?  Any hospital?  Yes.  You went to the hospital?  Did they stitch your head up or anything?  They stitched my head up a little bit.  Yeah.  Washed out my eye.  Washed out your eye.  Why the patch?  Because I can't really open up my eye.  You can't open it?  No, not well, because the glass in the eye kind of hurts.  Yeah, a little bit.  Can we look at the scratches on your head?  You've got to see them.  No, I really can't take it off. 
[01:32:30]  You can't take it off.  I don't want to.  What?  Okay, no, no.  I'm still, look, I'm still willing to believe this.  I'm still willing to believe this.  I'm getting a patient over there.  So, you got scratches, but they had to be stitched.  How many stitches did you get?  Three stitches.  All on one cut or two on one cut?  No, all on one cut.  All on one cut.  Three stitches.  Minor, yes.  Is there any way to lift it up to take a look underneath?  If you really, I'd rather not.  I mean. 
[01:33:00]  All right, Ben.  Ben, see you.  I'm trying to take it off out there and rub your eye.  Well, you were on the side.  No, no, no.  Oh, no, no.  I'm talking about the bandage on his head.  Well, lift up the patch of it.  Yeah, let's look at the eye.  I really can't open up, I've showed Rick before, I really can't open up my eye.  I always do.  You just, you can't really.  I mean, he's blinking, that eye's blinking a lot.  No, I have a question.  Yeah.  All right, Rick, to you.  You said you had glass in your eye.  Yes.  How come you were rubbing your eye before if there's glass?  Because it bugs the hell out of me.  Oh. 
[01:33:30]  Didn't they get all the glass out?  Yeah, they did, but it scratches.  It scratches on my eye.  It scratches, huh?  Scratches in your eye.  Yes.  Well, that happens.  Sometimes the cornea gets scratched open.  Yes.  And it takes time to heal.  And that's the only injuries you had, was the glass in the eye and the stitches above  your patch?  Yeah.  My driver's still window shattered.  Let's see the stitches.  I really can't.  I'll come in.  Next time I'm here, I'll show you the scar.  You know, it would be totally...  No, don't do it, Steve.  You know, it would be... 
[01:34:00]  I'm holding my head now.  It's going to hurt.  You know something.  Wait, we've all had stitches.  You can take the...  My doctor told me not to.  I don't want to get infected.  I swear...  No, I'll cover my head now because I'm supposed to anybody in the studio.  No, no, don't worry.  No one's going to pull it off.  No, no, really.  No one pull it off.  But the thing is, this would totally be resolved just if we saw a suspicious.  Because I must say, everyone has been talking behind your back saying that you're facing  it.  It's very suspicious.  Now, Rick, was there something behind, like, I heard a story that he couldn't make it  in one day. 
[01:34:30]  He couldn't make it in...  Well, last week, he never made it in on Monday, which was the snow day, saying that, you know,  the trains weren't running.  Well, that's fine, but...  But, you know what?  Monday wasn't that bad and trains were running.  I didn't say the trains weren't running.  I couldn't get to the train station, but...  What hospital was it?  Northern Westchester.  Northern Westchester.  Okay.  Emergency room.  I mean, I feel like...  What?  No, no, don't ever feel like an idiot.  Everyone's looking at me really funny.  Well, just take the patch off, show us the stitches, and then we all look like idiots. 
[01:35:00]  But I really would rather not, because when it comes...  How about the next time I come in, I will show you the scar.  No, because you might cut yourself and get...  Yeah, that's what I do.  I'm empathetic.  Stinky.  When he first came in, he said he didn't want to take the patch off, because he still has  glass in it.  Right.  Well, I think there probably is...  That's what he said to me.  Is there glass in it?  This is a little weird, man.  That's what you were rubbing your eye.  Because it itches because of the scratch.  I think this kid came in with a fake injury, man.  No, come on.  No, I'm still...  I totally am willing to believe you. 
[01:35:30]  How about we all put...  Now, here's a little more of what happened last.  All right, Rick.  Wednesday, he was supposed to be in.  Yes.  I never got a phone call.  He knows my number.  He's left me messages before.  Well, Rick, come on.  Nothing...  I don't like calling you either.  No.  When was this accident?  It was at my hometown.  When?  I went Wednesday.  My car...  And that's why you didn't call Rick?  Yeah, it really was.  But how come you found the time to call Steve...  All right, hold on.  ...and a little AJ from the other show?  All right, here we go. 
[01:36:00]  You guys are willing to listen to me.  All right, let's...  I'm just trying to figure this out.  I know.  I understand.  Do you get me?  It sounds a little...  All you have to do is pull down the bandage.  I will show you...  And then we look like tools.  All right.  On...  Oh, my...  We've all had stitches.  All you have to do is go like this.  Show the edge of the stitch and boom.  What's going to happen?  I'll show you on Wednesday.  This is time to come out for Wednesday.  All right, let him talk.  Now, what happened?  My car...  Steve, you got something on this?  No, let him tell his story.  Your car?  My car...  I left a dome light on in my car so my car didn't start because the battery was dead. 
[01:36:30]  Okay.  And when I got it jumped, I was on the way to the station.  That's...  I called when I found out my car was dead.  Okay.  And then on the way to the station, you have to ask him to call.  By accident, I called Steve.  And your whole head went through the windshield?  No, the side window.  The side window.  Because the motorcycle hit him on the side, so it threw his head through the side window.  What was the name of the guy on the motorcycle?  You can't give out memes like that, right?  Well, we can always dump it out.  Ben?  No, you know what I love about this, too, is that he can't find to call any of us. 
[01:37:00]  And I love the excuse that our interns all of a sudden have.  I don't know the number.  I'm actually going to be in defense of this, too, because I really...  I have trouble calling because I don't know anyone but Opie's number.  But, Ant, we fixed that problem weeks ago.  We all gave him phone numbers.  You got to call us.  Mike has a good point.  And I've been hearing from Jesse.  All right, all right.  All right, that's boring.  But Mike has a good point on line nine.  Well, let me...  We'll go to Mike.  All right.  Mike, what's up?  It's WNAW.  Dude. 
[01:37:30]  Hey.  What happened to the dude on the motorcycle?  And why was he out on Wednesday in the snow and the rain on a motorcycle?  It makes no sense.  It wasn't raining and snowing on Wednesday.  It was crappy out Wednesday.  It really wasn't.  All right.  What happened to the guy on the bike?  Yeah, what happened to the guy on the bike?  He really just...  My car was more destroyed than his.  But what happened to him?  Wait, the guy had to go flying.  He really didn't.  We weren't going that fast.  But wait, what happened to him?  Where he came from, he was just kind of...  And he left?  Yeah.  Wait, wait. 
[01:38:00]  He left?  All right.  Hold on.  Okay.  All right.  All right.  All right.  All right.  All right.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Hold on.  I have an accident report.  I'll bring it at the time.  If you guys...  What?  You have an accident report, too?  Is that fake, too?  Yes, that's fake, too.  Wow.  I know people in high places.  If you guys will...  I think it's a plot for airtime.  Well, it's working.  Let me tell you.  It's working.  Now, he hit the door.  Yes.  It was enough for...  Let me just get this straight.  It's enough force to physically move the vehicle enough that your head... 
[01:38:30]  It moved your car enough.  Yes.  Because in order for your head to go through the driver's side window,  your car has to move to put your head through the window.  It's not your head that moves.  When your head goes through anything,  it is the actual vehicle moving into your head.  So he hits your car with enough force to move the vehicle  so your head goes through the window.  Yes.  It's basic physics.  But nothing happens, and he rides his motorcycle away?  Swear to God.  I have an accident report.  I'll bring it in.  It's not fake. 
[01:39:00]  Nothing is fake.  Is your car here?  No.  How did you get here?  The train.  How did you get to the train, say?  Car.  Kevin, what's up?  Hey, listen.  Hey.  This guy is so full of it,  he doesn't want to show you the stitches  because he doesn't have any.  I know.  There's no reason in hell.  I work in the emergency room.  There's no reason in hell why he can't show you no stitches  if he has them.  Hmm.  And that's like a...  Where'd you get that bandage?  Out of your side.  Wayne Reed, right around the corner.  I actually got it before I came here.  He hasn't believed me. 
[01:39:30]  It's barely on your forehead.  With this one?  This one's just...  It's kind of popping up.  We might be able to even look underneath.  And will you agree that maybe you might see some swelling in that area?  No, you can't tell because the bandage is huge.  Not even around his eye.  Jerry.  Yeah.  How is that headwind?  Hey, Jerry.  Hi.  I just got into a car accident, and I got 50 stitches across my eyelids, and they didn't  put any bandages on me.  No, it's not on his eyelids.  Oh, no, because... 
[01:40:00]  No, he's got...  This is what he's got.  He's got a patch over his eye because he had a little glass in there, and he scratched  up his eye, even though you can't really tell when he lifted up the patch.  And then he has a bandage above the eye where he has some stitches.  A bandage is above the eye.  What make a motorcycle was this, sir?  Well, put it this way.  I just received 50 stitches...  It was a Honda.  No one drives Hondas.  It was a...  I drive a Honda.  People drive the Hondas.  It was a Honda, and he hits the door.  What did he say to you after he hit you? 
[01:40:30]  Are you okay?  Are you okay?  And then he took off.  No.  I mean, he waited around for the police.  He waited for the cops.  All right.  All right.  That's why I have a police report, which I will bring to you next time I'm here so  you guys don't think about it.  All you have to do is show us the bandage.  I don't...  Everyone is like...  Rachel.  Okay.  Yeah.  What's up?  People's heads don't go through driver-sized windows.  Well, no.  It can happen.  It can happen.  How would a motorcycle driver drive away if it hit him with enough impact to make  his head...  Well, that's what I'm saying. 
[01:41:00]  A lot more damage would be done to the guy.  And he turned his head so it was head-on.  Don't buy it.  No way.  All right.  I got something for him.  Okay.  It looks like you have nice, poofy, shampooed hair.  Did you take a shower recently?  I washed my head.  I didn't take a shower.  Did you take off the bandage?  No.  I was told not to.  I swear to...  That's a dry bandage.  But it's not wet.  It's not wet.  It's soggy.  It would be all messy.  I washed my hair.  That is a brand new bandage. 
[01:41:30]  But wouldn't it come off if it got wet a little?  Well, it hasn't yet.  How can you keep it from getting wet washing your hair?  Because...  Very good question, Opie.  Thank you.  Okay, you're right.  Detective Opie.  Let's see.  Take the bandage.  No, I don't want to.  Anne-Marie.  You've got to take that bandage.  I really...  I was caught...  I mean, and considering how much he's touching it and pushing on it...  I love this.  Anne-Marie.  Yes.  Hey.  Hi, Brian.  Hi, Anne-Marie.  Hi.  Hey, what happened to him?  Well, I don't know about the accident because I wasn't working whenever he got in the accident. 
[01:42:00]  But I can tell you he's very accident prone.  Hang up, Anne-Marie.  Hang up the phone.  Why not?  What's the matter, Brian?  Keep her on the phone.  She's...  I work with her.  Trying to figure this out.  What do you mean he's accident prone?  Oh, my God.  Yeah, fine.  Tell her about...  Tell them about the incident.  The other incident.  How many incidents have you had, Brian?  Oh, my God.  We're on to something.  Tell them about the hot boiling water on my crotch.  You can tell them that.  Oh, that's true.  Oh, that's right.  You can tell them that.  He's a regular over at the Hudson Valley Hospital. 
[01:42:30]  Really?  Oh, yeah.  He's like...  He falls...  Well, you know, like, a lot of people can fall down the stairs, but Brian can actually  fall up the stairs and get hurt.  Like that Munchausen by proxy syndrome.  Only without a child.  He just does it to himself.  All right.  Hold on, Anne-Marie.  For the attention.  You do that?  What town was this in?  Yorktown.  I live in Yorktown, yeah.  Yorktown.  Okay.  Bill, you work in Yorktown?  No, no, no.  I live in Yorktown.  But listen.  Okay. 
[01:43:00]  I got a friend that's a state trooper.  Yeah.  Was it the state trooper that helped this kid?  Yeah.  Yeah?  I got a friend that's a state trooper.  He would have told me.  He just came on a motorcycle to see me.  He would have told me if there was a motorcycle accident.  Besides, there's so much sand on the roads, especially right after the blizzard, there  was no way that anybody's driving a motorcycle around here because you'd be dead.  I've seen people driving a motorcycle.  I have the police report.  I swear to you.  I'll bring it in the next time I see you.  All you have to do is take the bandage off.  I don't know what to do.  What police department?  Like, what area? 
[01:43:30]  Is there any way we can call right now and verify that there was an accident?  What road did it happen on?  Yeah, what road did it happen on?  What road was it?  It was in Pleasantville.  What road?  What road?  Pleasantville Road.  Dude, you came to work making an accident, man.  Dude, hold on.  Maybe I'm embellishing it a little bit.  That's scary.  Embellishing a little bit.  All right, now we're getting on to it.  What is embellishing a little bit?  We work with a bunch of freaks around us.  What's embellishing a little bit? 
[01:44:00]  How much is embellished?  Be honest.  Oh, I really got hit by a motorcycle, Mike.  Maybe my head didn't go through the window.  Was this last year?  All right.  Wait, wait, wait, wait.  Maybe the head didn't go through the window.  So it hit the window.  No, well, I think...  So there's no glass in your eye?  There is glass.  From where?  What broke?  No, my window did break.  But my head and my nod went through the window.  It might have been his...  Wait, let me...  Mike, Mike, what's up?  How you doing, guys?  I just can't order glass for a living.  Yeah.  All right?  It takes almost a hammer to put those through a side window.  They're not meant to break. 
[01:44:30]  Right.  This guy must have got creamed if he could have even come close to get his head through  a side window.  So you're saying maybe it was the guy, the motorcycle guy's helmet?  Maybe it was...  Maybe it was...  From across the car?  But he just drove away?  No.  He was fine.  I have the accident report.  I'll give you the guy's number when I get home.  I'll call you.  So then what...  If your head didn't go through, what's on your head?  It was the glass shattered onto my head.  Okay.  All right.  It hits.  Glass shatters on your head.  And it was enough to...  Oh, lift it up.  Lift it up.  You have to lift it up. 
[01:45:00]  You've got to lift that damn thing up.  You've got to...  I'm dying to see this now.  Lift.  It's got to be...  I really don't want to.  I'm feeling really...  That's the purpose here.  We're trying to...  We're working this out.  We're working through.  We're working with single white male.  I'm telling you.  We're working through this.  I'm effing free.  Keep the cop.  Oh, my God.  Okay.  We're trying to recreate the accident scene here.  Yeah.  All right.  Here's a cop.  Here's a cop that's been on many...  Yes.  ...details.  Okay.  I've seen many accidents.  So what you're saying is you're in the left-hand lane attempting to make a left-hand turn? 
[01:45:30]  No.  I'm in my right lane making a left-hand turn.  Making a left...  An illegal turn.  Okay.  Yes.  Wait.  You're making an illegal turn there?  No, no.  It's legal.  Are you in the turning lane?  You're going left.  It's a one-way street.  One lane.  I mean, not one lane.  I'm sorry.  One lane each direction.  Yeah.  Okay.  So it doesn't matter left or right.  All right.  Go ahead.  Okay.  Pleasantville Road.  What university is there?  Quickly.  Quickly.  Each university.  Okay.  All right.  University.  Pleasantville Road, and you're at an intersection.  What road are you turning on to? 
[01:46:00]  This is a familiar route because you're on your way to work.  I was on my way to work and school and all that.  You take this every day.  So Pleasantville, you make a left on...  Manville.  Manville.  Manville.  Manville.  Okay.  All right.  Approximately how far back is the motorcycle when you make the turn?  Probably 20 feet.  And he passes you over the double yellow.  I think what might have happened was that his foot...  What he said was his foot slipped off the brake pedal, and he kept going into my car.  His foot slipped off the brake pedal. 
[01:46:30]  He didn't use the handshake.  He doesn't use that front brake.  So his foot slipped, and he went in.  So it was just...  So he's almost like next to you.  Yeah.  And he built up enough speed to fly into your car and even shatter a window and fly off  his motorcycle so his helmet hits the window.  Just...  How fast were you going?  I have a stop because I was making a turn.  But I mean, how fast were you going on that road before you came to a stop?  30?  35?  Maybe.  There's no way.  Okay. 
[01:47:00]  I have a conclusion.  Not just going on off his bike like Gary Busey.  Keep it coming.  I have a conclusion.  After being affiliated with the show for almost two years, we have a lack of security.  Because this guy should just not be in...  Who does the screening?  Now, Keith, you've talked to a lot of people that you might be arresting, you might not be,  and you get stories out of them that you can tell right away if they're true or false.  You're a seasoned cop.  This is really...  This is shit.  Keith, you ever watch Cops and you see him in a question in the guy and he's like,  this is so... 
[01:47:30]  Like, this isn't panning out.  There should be beads of sweat rolling down this guy's forehead.  Is there?  Let me see.  No.  No.  I'm fat.  Next time he comes to work, I'd like to see the car.  All right, Keith.  Thank you.  Okay.  Bye-bye.  A lot of people are saying you'd be in a neck brace.  Yeah.  What happened to your neck?  Nothing?  Nothing.  Swear to God.  My head may not have went through the window.  All right.  It may not have went through the window.  I have a police report.  All right.  So now, like, your head didn't go through the window.  So, let's see the stitches.  No. 
[01:48:00]  You have no stitches.  No.  We've drawn the conclusion now that you do not have stitches.  Under those bandages.  No.  It's not what we want to believe.  We have drawn the conclusion through questioning and working through this that you cannot possibly  have three stitches on any cut under that bandage.  Okay.  You don't, do you?  No.  Okay.  You have a scratch.  Yeah, right.  You got me.  What is it?  It's a scratch.  It's a scratch.  Yes.  I just got embellished a little bit.  So you embellish with the stitches. 
[01:48:30]  Then you could take it off.  Hey, it's a cut.  Did you indeed go to the hospital?  Yes, I did.  Take off the bandage.  You can take it off.  It's an embarrassment because it's probably not going to be anything there.  Don't, don't even be embarrassed.  Just take it.  Take the cut on my finger, too.  You can redeem, you can redeem yourself by just being honest and take the bandage off.  We'll laugh at you and then we'll move on.  We'll laugh and we'll move on.  Let's go.  I want to see a cut on my finger that I got from it, too.  Take the bandage off.  Just the bandage on your head.  Just the one on your head.  Take the bandage.  You got to take it off now.  Here it comes.  It's going to hurt.  Let's take it off.  Let's take it. 
[01:49:00]  You see that?  Wait a minute.  Hold on.  Hold on.  All right.  Turn your head.  I am scared for my finger.  There's nothing.  Dude, I was honestly expecting maybe a cut.  Yeah, at least a little.  A little cut.  There's nothing.  There's nothing.  I mean, nothing there.  There really is nothing there.  Dude, there is nothing there.  Holy ass.  There's absolutely nothing.  I am scared for my safety.  People, I can't stress to you enough.  Like, not even.  There's nothing there.  There's not even an abrasion. 
[01:49:30]  There is nothing under that.  It went from three stitches to the head going to the window and there's nothing under there.  Because I was putting.  That is skin on the same side of each.  It does not look any different.  And there is not even any swelling or anything.  Dude, there's nothing.  Nothing hit.  I have a police report.  Okay.  Can you get something on my face?  Was it Earl's friend, the responsible man on the motorcycle?  Was that it?  Earl's friend, the responsible man?  Now let's go.  Now let's go phase two here.  Dude, take the patch off.  Take the patch off.  You don't need the patch. 
[01:50:00]  Take the patch off.  Obviously, you didn't have that.  Take the patch off.  Open your eye.  No, I really can't open my eye.  Open your eye.  That is true.  It's not tearing.  It's not red.  It's not red.  The whites of your eye are white.  I can't even open my eye.  How many fingers?  I can see that of my right eye.  I can see five.  Close your right eye.  Open the other eye.  I can't.  Open the eye.  Open the goddamn eye.  There's nothing wrong with your eye.  Please don't do this anymore.  I swear.  You're scaring us.  Open your stupid eye.  Open the eye.  Open the eye.  Single white male. 
[01:50:30]  Open the eye.  There's nothing wrong with it.  You have nothing on your head.  I swear to you, there's something wrong with my eye.  There's something on your forehead.  You had a huge patch.  There's nothing on your other eye.  I was saying you couldn't even take the patch off the shower.  There's nothing on your forehead.  Holy S.  That is the best.  Now, look.  All right.  It's opening up.  Yeah, it's opening up a little bit.  All right.  I swear, if you guys...  It's opening.  Yes.  All right.  Open it up.  I'm not getting embellished about the eye.  Open it.  No.  Pull the bottom lid down a little.  That really does hurt. 
[01:51:00]  Well, pull it down.  I just want to see if it's red.  Pull the bottom lid down.  Now, open the other eye.  I can't open up my eye.  Hold it open.  That really does hurt.  Take the pain.  Hold it open a little.  Hold your eye open.  It's...  I want to see if there's any irritate...  Look, it's totally white.  Dude, do you see any red?  I swear, Eric.  It looks like his other eye.  There's no red.  There's nothing wrong with you.  I mean, there are a little bloodshot, but his other eye is bloodshot, too, so... 
[01:51:30]  There's nothing wrong with you.  But please wear the patch.  Feel free to wear the patch.  With my parrot.  Please feel free to wear the patch.  All right.  Look at him.  He's freaking out over here.  Hey, in one second...  Who the hell screams these people?  Not always that.  What's up, up in?  Look, Brian is a little weird.  Do you remember the first couple days you showed up to work?  He, like, brought in pies and was buying us coffee and was just...  Well, that's nice.  You want to make a good impression.  I'm not...  I'm not going to delve off into any other directions here that don't have any validity 
[01:52:00]  with this case that we're working on right here.  The injury case.  The injury case.  I still got to know.  Did you embellish with the motorcycle?  No.  I have the police report.  I will bring it in.  All right.  We are looking forward to seeing the police report.  All right.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you very much for the friggin' half-hour radio.  Steve, you're not going home early today, are you?  No.  Okay.  Not at all.  Steve, we've got to get at least a still picture of the unveiling of the wounds. 
[01:52:30]  Okay.  What were you working on before we pulled you in?  Nothing.  Nothing?  I'm checking out his feedback.  All right.  Okay.  Great.  We'll let you continue ahead on your job.  All right.  You can wear the patch if your eye is hurting a little bit.  All right.  Okay.  Thank you very much.  That was great.  Take your bandage with you.  We wouldn't want to get any infections from all the blood on there.  That is great. 
[01:53:00]  What's the matter?  Nothing.  I'm a little hurt.  You're a little hurt?  I feel like an ass, to be honest with you.  Well, you know something?  When you do that...  Open your eye!  And then we can, like, move on.  You're still, like, faking that you can't open the eye.  The thing is, I understand you feel like an ass, but when you do certain things and they  don't pan out and there's consequences, the one consequence is looking like an ass.  Yeah.  So you did this.  Now you move on and you learn.  That may be embellishing.  You said you had stitches.  There's nothing on your forehead.  Nothing at all.  Next time, you fake a knee injury, you wrap it up in an ace bandage, no one could call 
[01:53:30]  you on it.  You just say, it hurt.  I hurt my leg.  But a head wound is like, wow, that's a tough one because it's right there.  And the patch, you know something?  If you're just a head wound, maybe that would be, but then you add the patch, it's a little  much.  A little much.  We might have believed if you just had the patch or the eye patch.  Not both, though.  The both would put it over the top.  But next time, a leg injury, back injury, something you can't really, say, take the 
[01:54:00]  advantage of.  Jay, dude, stop talking to this guy, call security, hide behind something, you'll never  see a freaking accident report.  He's lying.  He's a psycho, bro.  All right?  Thank you.  Wait, wait, wait.  He said he feels like an ass.  That's because he's busted.  Now he's about to strike.  You're not going to strike, are you?  I have a hand in my hand.  All right.  Can we check his clothes and stuff?  For real.  You're not going to go crazy, are you?  Dude, he is, man.  Get rid of him.  All right.  Do you own any guns?  No guns.  Do you have any guns on you? 
[01:54:30]  No.  Do you have any needles in your pocket?  Okay, let's frisk them over.  I'm not going to get stuck in here, am I?  Thanks for being.  Can we check his clothes for weapons?  I don't think he's carrying any weapons, Opie.  You thought he had stitches.  No, we didn't think he had stitches, but, you know, I would, I think, thank you.  He was just trying to garner a little sympathy.  Are you the man of a thousand faces?  Excuse for the day off.  All right.  We can move on now.  All right.  Thank you very much.  You can go back to whatever, and don't feel too bad, you know. 
[01:55:00]  You pay, you know, you do something, it doesn't pan out, you pay, and now you'll forever  be the eyepatch guy, or what good message board name could it be?  Captain Psycho.  Captain Psycho.  I'm honored.  All right.  All right.  Well, continue with looking at instant feedback.  Thank you.  Thank you.  You can turn around, and there you go. 
[01:55:30]  There you go.  There he goes.  I don't think the watch, don't hit your head with the door.  That would hurt.  Lock that studio door.  Holy S.  Where the hell are you firing these people?  That was great.  The station for sports guys, Don and Mike, Obey and Anthony, and Ron and Fez is this station.  1027 WNEW, New York.  You know, you got to get Stinky in here.  I'm proud of Stink.  He's becoming more and more honest as he continues working on our radio show. 
[01:56:00]  He was, Stinky was a little, uh...  What, shy?  Shy at first.  Wouldn't really speak his mind, but he has changed.  Stink?  One of our favorite smartasses back in the office after the show, Stinky.  Stink, what are you feeling right now with this kid?  I hate him.  I don't want to see him.  Oh, wow.  He lied to me, like, constantly the whole day before the show.  Really?  I was asking him, you know, what happened? 
[01:56:30]  Oh, I got stitches.  I can't show them.  My eyes got glass in it.  It's like, you know, what am I going to do?  A little scary.  And you're a little, like, uncomfortable now.  Yeah, I don't want to talk to him.  So you guys are like, I'm uncomfortable.  Yeah, you've got to be a little sympathetic, I'll be.  I mean, there's a reason that he's doing this, you know.  I'm not out here to save the world and stuff,  but I kind of know there's some kind of reason that it's going on.  Anthony.  Yeah.  There was a reason why Joel Rifkin did what he did.  I know. 
[01:57:00]  That's what I'm saying.  I'm saying I'm not getting behind him.  There was a reason why that kid shot up the school in San Diego.  Absolutely.  And it was because when he lied one time or something,  people just jumped on him, maybe.  Yeah.  People are tuning in halfway through going, what the hell is going on?  It went from an A-team type crash.  Why don't you explain really fast?  Summarize.  I know.  Summarize what happened.  Well, Opie, our intern came in today. 
[01:57:30]  Yeah, he.  What's his name?  Ryan.  It's Ryan.  He came in.  He had a big bandage on his forehead.  Huge.  Huge.  Huge.  Very big bandage.  It took up half his forehead.  On his forehead.  And an eye patch over the left eye, his left eye.  Claiming he had an accident with a car and a motorcycle.  He was making a left.  So he went out to get coffee or something.  And we all started whispering in the back office.  We're like, holy yes.  The guy's faking. 
[01:58:00]  It just didn't seem.  Didn't add up.  Didn't add up.  He was trying to get off of work, I think, or an excuse for not coming in.  Because he didn't show up Wednesday.  Is that it, Rick?  Didn't show up Monday or Wednesday.  Didn't hear from him at all.  Yeah.  And Rick's just a prick to work for.  So he really ragged these guys.  Basically, he should be fired.  But he had an excuse.  And the excuse was that he was in this accident.  Yeah.  Hence the patch on his eye and the big, huge bandage on the forehead.  And the big bandage on his head.  And people were calling him on it. 
[01:58:30]  Yeah.  Yeah.  In the office.  We were talking.  And then we decided we'd just go on the air and hash it out.  Well, he comes in and says he was making a left.  The motorcycle was going straight around him.  They crashed.  His head went through the driver's side window, cutting his head, requiring three stitches in the ER, Opie.  And he had glass in his eye, which scratched the cornea.  And that's what the eye patch was for.  After some questioning about some things that didn't quite pan out, he fessed up that he might have been embellishing. 
[01:59:00]  No one has to go outside.  Everyone's in the studio.  He might have been embellishing.  He's the only one outside the studio now.  And that door's locked.  Freaked out.  So he said he might have been embellishing the story.  Who comes up with this crap?  He wouldn't take the bandage off his eye, off his head, off his forehead.  He wouldn't take the bandage off.  No one's going outside.  So no work's being done.  He said he didn't want to get infected.  He was lying right there standing in front of us, saying, I can't take it off. 
[01:59:30]  It'll get infected.  My doctor said no.  When we finally did get him to take the bandage off, because he fessed that he was embellishing,  and his head did not go through the window, just some glass broke from the motorcycle guy's helmet hitting the window,  or whatever, he got cut.  We wanted to see the cuts.  He finally said he was embellishing, took the bandage off.  Opie, there was not even a ding.  There wasn't a scratch where if you scratched yourself on your head, because he had an itch,  there wasn't even that red that you had. 
[02:00:00]  I have more of a mark on my face, you probably noticed today, from a watch cloth, because I scrubbed too hard.  Look, over here.  Right.  He doesn't even have that on his forehead.  You get more marks just from shaving than he has.  Yeah, yeah.  I can't stress to how much of a mark there was nothing.  Nothing.  And then the eye patch comes off.  He was blinking real hard with that eye, saying that there was glass in it, even though there wasn't glass.  But the eye started loosening up, and he's not bright, and he pulled down the bottom of the eye,  and there was no red at all. 
[02:00:30]  No red in the eye.  So, obviously.  So it went from a major car accident to, he made up the story because he missed Monday and Wednesday,  and now no one wants to leave the studio to work.  It was a story.  Let's go back to Anne-Marie.  Anne-Marie.  Yes.  Hey.  How you doing?  All right.  Well, I can tell you that Brian probably, when he gets hurt, see what happens is,  he's kind of afraid that it's going to be worse than it really is. 
[02:01:00]  Anne-Marie, he wasn't hurt at all.  Oh, but I bet you he thinks he was.  I wouldn't put it past him.  I bet you he poked himself in the eye a couple times before he came to work.  No, he didn't do it on purpose, but he gets, like, he's very, um, tender.  Right.  You know what I mean?  Like, if he gets, like, a headache, you know, he's got a brain tumor, if, you know.  Oh, like a hypochondriac kind of thing?  Oh, my God.  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  What's, yeah.  But that's how...  Yeah, and we call him Briar the Liar. 
[02:01:30]  Look at...  Oh, what do you call him?  Briar the Liar.  Well, because he exaggerates a lot?  A little bit, yeah.  Jesse?  Yeah.  Do you remember when he said he had to take a day off because he had surgery on his head  or his brain?  No, it was his foot.  What?  What?  Something like that.  It was his foot.  It was his foot?  Yeah.  Oh, he said his brain.  You're right.  You said he had surgery on his head.  Well, maybe his head is...  All right, let's go.  Get Briar.  Briar, what happened?  What happened when?  You had surgery.  On my ankle, yes.  On your ankle.  Yes, that was true. 
[02:02:00]  And that was true.  What happened?  Now nothing I'm going to say.  Well, now you know what it is.  It's the boy that cried wolf thing.  You can't blame us now for not believing certain things.  Earl.  You've set this...  Earl, stay in here.  Steve, stay in here.  Get sticky in here.  Now, what happened to your leg, to your ankle?  I broke my leg.  I tore, like...  What happened?  I tore my ligaments playing basketball.  Playing basketball.  And you got an operation done.  It doesn't look like you're too active.  Do you have a scar on there?  Is there an operation scar there?  Yeah, on my knee.  All right, let's see. 
[02:02:30]  He was playing basketball with Michael Jordan.  Brian, you...  All right.  Brian, you told me it was when you tripped.  I thought you said ankle.  I thought you just said ankle.  Wait, I thought you just said ankle.  You said ankle.  All right.  I don't see any surgical scars.  Wait, where's the scar?  How long ago was this done?  My surgery scar was done a while ago.  But my knee...  But what's the recent one?  Wait, wait, wait, wait.  Guys, when was this?  When was this?  A couple weeks ago.  Do you remember when... 
[02:03:00]  Remember when you guys made a quick comment that someone tripped over the door?  He tripped over the door.  Right.  Brian, I remember that.  And you said you came in and you said you had to have, like, your ankle...  You, like, tore a ligament or something.  I didn't tore a ligament from that.  I don't need to be writing you out.  I want to see my...  I'm not trying to write you out.  Where is the surgery scar that you had from this recent operation that was two weeks ago?  It was orthoscopic, so you're not familiar to see.  I swear.  Oh, no.  We have no surgery scars over here.  Wait a minute. 
[02:03:30]  It was orthoscopic.  So, what do you got?  A mole.  A mole?  A mole?  Oh, my God.  I can't believe it.  It's not a mole.  Okay.  Now, Brian, haven't you also been going to physical therapy every Friday?  Yes, I have been.  For what?  My ankle.  For the ankle.  Yeah.  That you have the orthoscopic surgery.  That you have the mole on. 
[02:04:00]  Yes, the mole on.  And this therapy is where?  It's in...  Peekskill, sorry.  Pleasantville again.  No, Peekskill.  And what do they do to help you out?  They put me on different machines.  Although I'm not very active, as Opie said, they put me on machines that make me...  On machines?  Yes.  Because your ankle, what do they say is actually wrong?  I have total ligaments.  Your total ligaments?  Yes, a lot of them.  So, now you, like, walk and do things, treadmill or something.  Yes, treadmill, they put me on different machines.  Okay.  But there's no scar?  No. 
[02:04:30]  It's amazing.  It's new, Serge.  All right.  Where's...  Bring Jesse in here.  Pathological Brian's a new nickname.  Mark from the Bronx.  Get everyone in here.  Get Stinky in here.  So, okay, you had that surgery.  Yeah.  But it was nothing with your brain or your head?  What was that, Jeff?  Yeah.  You said...  See, Ben, I don't remember exactly, because it wasn't, like, a big deal, but you said you  couldn't come in one Friday. 
[02:05:00]  I don't mean...  I feel bad, because I'm like...  Oh, whatever.  It's cool.  You said you had, like...  You needed surgery on your head.  On your head?  No, no.  That was Rick making a joke about me.  You said I needed a lobotomy.  No.  Oh.  No, no.  You said it to me that you had head surgery.  I never said I had head surgery.  I mean, I was getting...  And Rick said that.  Brian, Brian, when you make a joke, that means it's not real.  All right, well...  Oh, my goodness.  I missed work one day.  All right, here's the deal.  There's a lot of people very uncomfortable right now.  So, we're going to have a little vote. 
[02:05:30]  What are you going to vote?  Who wants Brian to go home today?  Yeah.  What?  I'm not voting that.  He lied.  Why would...  Who cares?  I'm fine with it.  I don't care.  I think it makes for a great radio.  What, you want to toss a diamond in the ruffle?  Like, there's out the door?  No, I said go home today.  Today?  Yeah.  No.  I think he's doing a great job.  Thank you, I think.  Come on.  You're going to get more stories if we live.  This is great.  If we live. 
[02:06:00]  Hands up.  Who wants him out?  Today.  Today?  No.  I think I'll put my hand up, too.  Oh, you want to go home today?  Steve, take care of the eye.  You're cool.  Well, you're big.  And you know how to handle yourself.  I don't know.  He's not going to...  There's only three people that want him to leave.  I don't know if you're being honest.  Let's be honest.  Let's be honest.  Let's get out of the room.  I'm being honest.  I think it's fine.  I'll turn my back, and I'll put my hands against the wall if you guys want.  All right.  Turn your back, because maybe someone doesn't want to see that they're voting.  Oh, a secret ballot?  All right. 
[02:06:30]  Who wants him to leave?  Yeah, look.  Four votes are going up right now.  Four and four.  I had mine up before.  I just didn't see it.  Earl, it's to you.  The deciding vote.  Earl, the vote.  Jesus Christ.  No way.  The man that can't do anything right.  Earl's not going to vote him off the island.  That's his brother, man.  Earl still thinks he's a virgin.  Earl, I like you.  I can't believe you guys want him to stay today.  It's...  Why not?  I feel bad. 
[02:07:00]  Screw feel bad.  I feel an intern.  I don't want you to vote me out.  Kids effed up.  Why did you do it?  Can we ask that?  We really haven't asked the why.  Why did you go through this elaborate accident scheme?  Intimidation.  What do you mean?  Everyone had a story on the show, and you figured you needed one?  Yeah, sure.  No, I'm not going to...  What intimidation?  Wait, you are intimidated, or are you...  I'm intimidated by this show.  You're intimidated.  All right.  Hold on. 
[02:07:30]  Hold on.  Hold on.  Before you get into this...  Yeah.  Because it is a tie.  It's four that want him to go, four that want him to stay.  I'm telling you, we're going to the listeners.  I'm sorry.  I'm screwed.  Clear the phone lines.  One, two, three, four, five, six, two, four...  Okay, we got nine phones ringing.  And that's what's going to decide it.  I still got a note.  Was there ever an accident?  Yes, there was.  Was it in the last calendar year?  Yes, it was.  See, now I can't even believe that.  I can't...  Now I can't believe...  But when I bring in the accident report, I want you to...  And I interrupted you. 
[02:08:00]  Go ahead.  Say what you have to say.  You were saying...  Oh, you're intimidated by the show.  Yes.  Now, why is...  I'm sure anybody...  Jess, when you first came here, it was a little rough, a little intimidating?  Yeah.  All right.  And how did you deal with it?  I'm still dealing with it.  What are you guys talking about?  But you just come in, you do your job, you hang out, you get your barbs in where you can,  you kind of...  You mix it up with us.  No, like you just don't say any...  I would wait until you guys would talk to me, and I didn't bring food.  Okay. 
[02:08:30]  But that was a nice gesture.  That was a nice gesture.  But now, how did you feel this was going to help you?  Because I felt like if I didn't come up with...  Because if I didn't elaborate on my injuries, you guys wouldn't believe me, which...  Well, yeah, you put you over the top there.  But why did you come up with the story at all?  It wasn't a story.  It really...  I mean, what?  Oh, it's a story.  You don't have stitches.  Okay, that is a story, but the accident was true.  Take the patch off your stupid eye. 
[02:09:00]  Take the patch off.  God.  I'm not going to play along now.  Take the patch off.  My eye really does bother me.  I really can't take all the...  His eye bothers him, Opie.  You guys are all insane.  Don't, you know...  I have a scratched cornea.  If you shine a light in the person's eye, it kills.  Yeah.  You don't want to do that, do you?  We're not shining a light in his eye, for Christ.  We're starting the voting.  Okay?  The listeners will decide.  I'm packing up as we speak.  Oh, Dave.  Yeah.  Have you heard the last hour of radio? 
[02:09:30]  Yeah.  Okay, what do you think?  I think the guy's a pathological liar.  I think you've got to get rid of him.  All right, get rid of him.  All right.  Thank you, Dave.  Take care.  One bell.  Stinky.  Make sure Stinky keeps track.  Okay.  Let's go to Mike.  Mike?  Mike?  I'm tired, man.  This guy's crazy, but he's funny.  So, no...  See, that's what I'm saying.  All we want to know is should we, you know, send him home today, right now?  No, no.  This is way entertaining, man.  I'm listening. 
[02:10:00]  All right.  Stay.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Let's go to another Mike.  Mike?  Keep him there, because two words.  Ted Kaczynski.  Thank you, Mike.  All right.  Have you been known to be violent at any time?  I'm a very sweet guy.  Very sweet.  And he's a liar, so that might mean...  That's what they said about Joel Rifkin.  No, and...  So you don't have any aggression or anything?  You guys are insane.  Everyone says that one day I might just, you know, snap.  Oh, good.  Let's just keep him around.  You're insane, Anthony. 
[02:10:30]  And there's no gag anymore.  I can't believe you guys want him here after what we just heard.  Oh, wait.  Earl's raising his hand now.  Yeah, but it doesn't matter, because you were a pussy when we needed you.  So now the listeners are going to decide.  Troy?  Yeah.  Hey.  He's the guy.  See, everybody.  F you all.  Sympathy vote.  I love it.  F you all.  Let's go to Jerry.  Jerry?  Fire him.  He's a fairy.  Fire him?  Yeah, fairy.  He's a fairy.  Fire him.  All right. 
[02:11:00]  Okay.  We're running out of votes here.  Let's go to Frank.  Frank?  What's up, guys?  Hey.  Hey, now I know why my instant feedback's never getting on the air anymore.  Fire his ass.  Fire his ass.  It's 3-3.  All right, guys.  Bye-bye.  Three votes to go.  Mark from the Bronx saying he should have used the Chewbacca defense quickly.  That it's just so ridiculous that you must have quit.  Jeremy?  Hey, guys.  I don't.  Hey.  I say keep him.  I think you've got a fast two on our hands.  F and you guys suck.  No, that was a keep.  Please, no, don't let him leave today. 
[02:11:30]  It's only 5 o'clock.  That leaves in two hours to come back with weapons.  Michael?  Hey, what do you think?  I think he should go.  All right.  He's like the guy at the ski lodge with the fake cast.  Okay.  Thank you.  All right.  It comes down to the one final vote.  Here it is.  Don't let me down.  Wayne?  Yeah, that's me.  All right.  You don't know me.  You will decide Brian's fate.  Fate.  Honestly, I know his doctor.  What?  Before I vote.  What?  I know his doctor. 
[02:12:00]  You knew his doctor?  I know his doctor.  I can verify for it all.  Conflict of interest on the voting, but.  Oh, but it's Bones McCoy.  Bones McCoy.  He waves up over his heels.  Anything that's wrong with him before he comes into work.  All right.  Every time.  Very funny.  You just saved your ass.  All right.  Wayne, it's.  I say keep the nut.  You.  Keep the nut.  Keep the nut.  Keep him, you know.  Maybe put one of them security bracelets on him so you know where he is all the time.  Will I take off my patch now?  He stays.  Keep on your patch?  I mean, you got a sucker bag that, you know, still around. 
[02:12:30]  So now you're going to admit that the patch is fake and you want to take it off now.  No, that was a joke.  I'm sorry.  Wayne, thank you.  You let me down and I was going to give you something for voting him out.  You're going to give me something to vote him out?  No, no, I can't.  You voted to keep him.  Brian, I'd appreciate it if you didn't look me in the eye or even don't even come 20 feet  away from me.  Don't even enter the studio for the rest of the show.  Okay.  This the show?  Okay.  I can do that. 
[02:13:00]  And do not be in the office after the show's over.  Uh-oh.  Until I leave for the train.  It's like Michael Corleone in Rado.  You're nuts.  Look at me.  You're dead to me.  Wow.  I'm going to fully back out of the studio now.  This is, uh, you guys let me down, man.  What's the matter, O?  You don't like me?  You're saying you love the cycle factor.  Every time something happens, you go, I love the cycle factor.  We just got an hour of cycle factor.  Now it's like, hit the street.  Oh. 
[02:13:30]  What?  There he comes.  What?  Come on.  What?  You don't find this very entertaining on a very psychotic level?  You don't have to deal with them.  Look at these guys.  Look at Sticky and Jess.  They don't even want to go outside the studio now.  I'm never going to talk to them again.  You're the talent, guys.  You know?  Yeah.  You're the talent.  No, the problem is, it's the Opie and Anthony show.  I wanted him to go, and I wanted him to stay.  Then we went to all you guys.  It was four and four. 
[02:14:00]  Then we go to the listeners.  And the listeners let us down.  Or my side, anyway.  I saw your point.  Ben, are you happy?  No.  This sucks.  Get him out.  You're a frigging freak.  Thank you.  That is mental.  That whole story we just heard is beyond psycho factor.  That's mental.  All right.  Send him home for the day.  We can't.  And then we will talk about it.  No, we can't.  We'll talk about it.  No, we can't.  Why?  We did it the fair way.  Oh, I know we did it the fair way.  I'll accept the results. 
[02:14:30]  I'm just pissed.  I'm pissed at the results, but I'll accept them.  Well, the voting should be whether he should be fired or not.  We don't need good radio that bad, is all I'm going to say.  Look at this guy checking in.  Make him wear the patch as long as he still works there, no matter how long it is.  He's always got to come in now with that patch.  If he doesn't, he goes home.  Yeah, tell him that.  No, I'm serious.  He's got to wear the patch always.  No, the day he shows up without the patch, I swear to God, you've got to send him right home. 
[02:15:00]  No joke.  Rick, go tell him.  No, that's got to come from Rick.  Rick hired the lunatic.  Very good.  Michael from Tenton Falls.  He said that.  Tony, what's up?  Oh, before you start ripping on me, I agree you should have sent him home today.  I tried.  But, dude, this kid has got problems, bro.  And, dude, we've listened to your stories about your family.  Yeah.  Dude, my friend's pregnant wife works with your brother, Quinn.  You think after hearing Friday's show, she didn't look at him in a different way? 
[02:15:30]  Wait a minute.  First of all, first of all.  Dude, I agree, bro.  You're also yelling at me.  I've never faked an injury.  I know you have.  No one in my family faked an injury for sympathy.  All right?  Bro, nobody's questioning your integrity, bro.  But this kid has got problems.  He needs a nap ski.  Maybe a permanent one.  Oh, thank you, Tony.  Not you, Ope.  The kid.  No, I heard you.  Dude, man.  I don't know, Ope.  Nice knowing you, bro. 
[02:16:00]  This kid's going to whack you and stinky first.  Jeez.  Later, dude.  All right, Tony.  Hey, snowing you, brother.  Tuttle from New York.  Final test.  Does Brian like Huey Lewis and the news?  Look at my business card.  The color is bone.  Rob, what's going on?  Yo, fire his dumb ass.  You're calling stinky a rat, though.  No, because I thought the kid was answering the phone.  Oh.  Dude, stinky rocks, man.  Stinky rolls.  Yeah.  They can make him a stinky personal bitch.  All right.  They can do stupid things.  All right. 
[02:16:30]  All right, guys.  Thank you, Rob.  All right.  Look, Steve, you're all uncomfortable.  No, this isn't going to work.  He's got to go home today.  Oh, because...  No, because, like, Michael...  Here, Michael...  Now you're all uncomfortable.  Michael on line two.  Ope, change your diaper.  Opie.  Yeah.  What's your problem?  We're a grown man.  We're not...  Because the kid is effed up.  Opie.  Not even in a good way.  Not even in a way we could, like, exploit on the radio.  Who cares?  You can take him down, all right?  I saw you on XFL.  I mean, you're not, like, some little small wimp. 
[02:17:00]  Who cares?  He's not going to want to shoot anybody.  He doesn't know how to bandage himself.  So what?  See, now Ann wants to send him home.  But you know what?  Ann, stick to your word.  Keep him.  He's entertaining.  I'm just saying, if it's going to interfere with the show, then he's got to go home.  No.  See, I'm not happy with the decision we made, but we made the decision.  I have to live with that.  Yeah, but you're...  That's fine.  Yeah, but you're crying about it.  Who cares?  Michael.  Keep him away.  Michael, you...  Stinky!  God, someone will back me up.  Stinky, talk to Michael. 
[02:17:30]  Everyone is uncomfortable now.  How are you going to look at this guy or, like, at the end of the show, go to the office  and sit down next to him?  What is he going to say to you?  Michael, the guy had a bandage on his forehead, claiming he had three stitches.  After about an hour, he finally took the bandage off.  Guess what?  There wasn't even a scratch.  Isn't that a little mental?  Does he have a Jeffrey Dahmer look to him, or why?  At least out of one eye, did you see it?  I mean, come on.  You're sitting here whining about this for 20 minutes.  Move on.  All right, we'll move on.  Thank you.  Okay. 
[02:18:00]  If I was him, I would leave on my own, out of embarrassment.  I don't know what he's doing.  He's just sitting there now.  I mean, no, he's just sitting there.  No one's talking to him.  He's afraid to come by the studio door, even.  Hey, tell him to go home.  What?  Tell him to go home.  Oh, you're not going to make me do that.  Oh, I will, but then the listeners will lash out at me.  Call me a crybaby.  It comes from you.  They'll go, okay, cool.  Tell him to go home. 
[02:18:30]  I can't do that.  Come on.  What am I?  Tell him to go home.  Tell him to go home and not to go home.  Come back.  Now, get out of here.  Come on.  That's not my job.  I don't hire and fire.  Well, that's Rick's job.  Rick should show some backbone.  Oh, see?  Come on.  You're pushing it off onto me.  Well, who's who's?  Hey, the name on the sign says Opie and Anthony, and you're Anthony.  Look.  Yeah, his name's first. 
[02:19:00]  Look.  Oh, you're going to pull that.  That's the first time you ever pulled that one.  Well, in this situation.  Just for the record, we've never played that before.  It works, though, in this situation.  Yeah, but you know we've never played that before.  Look, I already spelt out how I feel about this.  Look, if I'm not looked at as a crybaby, I'll do it right now.  No problem.  What are you thinking?  He's going to do it anyway. 
[02:19:30]  He can't do anything now.  He just has to sit there.  You know what?  I don't really care what people think of me.  Get him in here.  Yeah, make sure he doesn't go in the studio.  Bri.  Yeah.  You're outside the studio about what?  He said 20 feet from you.  Right.  That's what I asked you.  So, for the first time, you're following rules.  The Opie restraining order.  Should we do the prison visit, Opie?  Yeah, you want to do it that way?  Yeah, get him on the phone.  All right.  No, because then, no.  No, I can do it this way. 
[02:20:00]  Bri, you're making a lot of people uncomfortable.  I can tell.  I'll leave if you want me to.  That's okay.  I understand.  What?  What?  I understand.  You understand that?  Yeah.  We don't know if we want you back, though.  What?  What?  I'm going to lie?  That was, that was, that would suck.  Well.  Do you understand there has been a breach of faith here?  Don't you find it a little weird, the whole thing?  You're still wearing the patch, and you don't even have an eye injury.  You don't have an injury, though.  That's what you don't understand.  It's very injury. 
[02:20:30]  You said you had an injury on your forehead.  There's not even a scratch.  My head was smashed apart, and I lost my shoes.  So, uh, you're about 19 feet away.  Okay.  Yeah, move back.  Thank you.  God damn.  You're awful.  I'm so mean.  I'm mean.  The guy skipped the suit.  No, I see where you're coming from.  Shut up, Jess.  I don't doubt it, Jess.  Opie, you're 100% right.  What?  Stank, am I right?  You are.  Ben, am I right? 
[02:21:00]  I'm 100%.  Thank you.  200%.  You're not going to ask me?  I don't care.  I know you don't care.  That's all right.  These are good cookies.  Who wants them to come back?  Not everyone at once.  Wow.  That hurts.  How's it going to be different any day?  You know, tomorrow?  Awkward.  Yeah, you're calling sick.  Is the injury going to be healed?  You're calling sick half the time anyway.  Is this going to crush you?  Uh, not that much, but it will. 
[02:21:30]  A little bit, because I like you guys.  Aw.  I mean, I tried my heart as well here.  Aw.  I mean...  Be tough, be tough.  I'm talking to myself.  Um...  Would we have to worry about you coming back here and shooting everybody?  I like being blunt with this thing.  Now, is there anything that might happen?  Are you going to shoot everyone?  No, no, no.  No shooting going on.  Stab?  No.  You can still listen to us through the radio and stuff.  Let's see how things go. 
[02:22:00]  Can you step back a little bit?  Hello, I think he sounds fine to me.  I don't foresee any problems with him coming back.  So, Brian, why don't you...  You're not going to kill anybody, though, right?  No, nobody's going to be here today.  All right.  No threats, no threatening emails or anything?  Nothing at all.  What?  Nothing at all.  Nothing at all.  Brian, did you sign something?  Yeah.  When you started working here?  Yeah.  Okay.  That you're not to kill anybody?  Yeah, I didn't read the fine print, but I guess... 
[02:22:30]  I think that was in there.  Brian, I'd feel safer if you weren't around.  You know, it comes from this breach in faith.  We all trust each other here, and we don't lie to each other.  And then when a lie is made like that, we're like, hey, where does it end?  You know what I mean?  Okay.  Oh, I'm the guy.  You just made me the guy.  I just said that.  I've gotten that speech before.  Oh, no, you be the guy.  I'm going to go back to my cookies.  I'm okay.  And beer.  Hang out.  Cookies and beer.  I'm fine.  We'll leave the door jar.  We'll revisit this.  You're not fired. 
[02:23:00]  You're on what we call a permanent layoff.  Oh, I can lay it off.  All right, Rick, why don't you show Brian the door?  Oh.  What?  Jess?  That's terrible.  No, you guys are right.  The more I think about it.  He's all right?  No, you guys are right.  The more I think about it.  Why?  What were you thinking before?  Well, I just felt like it was, like, mean.  Yeah.  But, I mean, I...  See, that's what I'm doing.  But, I mean, look, that's kind of elaborate just to...  Yeah, but we don't...  No, you're right.  That's what I'm saying.  And I don't have to...  We don't work with him. 
[02:23:30]  It's someone like Stink.  I can see it in his face.  He's not happy.  Ben's not happy.  You're not happy.  I'm not happy.  Rick's not happy.  Yeah, I see.  That's what I mean.  I see the...  You don't have enough brain cells to figure out that the guy's a psychopath.  Right.  You're working with him, thinking everything's fine.  Brian, any final thoughts?  Oh.  Oh, God.  Yeah, you want to make a good statement?  It's been real. 
[02:24:00]  Do you feel this is justified?  Somewhat.  If I brought in the police report, would you guys still think I'm BS?  Oh.  Well, I have a problem with the stitches that weren't there.  Yeah, even if you are in some kind of an accident.  Like, the stitches not being there is a little weird.  Okay.  Not only that, if you really have an accident, then fine.  Call us and say you have an accident.  But don't not call us or call other people in this building and then show up the next day  that you're supposed to be here to work with an eye patch, a captain's hook hand, a freaking 
[02:24:30]  bandage on your head.  A parrot.  I'm surprised you didn't wipe off your own leg just so you can limp in here, for Christ's sake.  All right.  Well, we've got to take a break, Brian, so thank you.  Well, you know something.  What?  Send him home today.  And then let's really discuss this because, you know what it is.  Come on.  Have a little, you know, compassion.  I have compassion.  I just, I feel bad somewhere inside.  How old a guy are you?  20.  He's 20.  He didn't F up, tell a few wacky stories when you were 20.  But I F'd up so many times, and Rick's been a lot cooler than that. 
[02:25:00]  You didn't come in with a fake injury.  That's what I mean.  I'm on your side.  I'm saying a fake injury is weird to go to when you screw up.  That's single white female territory.  It's weird if I could figure out why you did it.  I really still don't understand why you would do it.  Is there some kind of an issue you got?  Are there other issues?  It's hard to scream across the studio, but it's a matter of being really afraid of you  guys and being intimidated.  You're 19 feet away.  Is it an attention thing? 
[02:25:30]  No.  You don't crave attention?  No.  Maybe?  No?  Hmm.  Dude, you look ridiculous.  You're standing there with an eye patch that you probably don't need.  Oh, probably.  He's warming up to you.  All right.  We've got to move on with the show.  Okay.  So, look.  You go home for the rest of the day because he can't think under these circumstances.  And we'll get back to you on the long term of this.  Sure.  I just want to see it.  All right.  That's all.  And it's just letting you off the hook lightly.  No, I'm not. 
[02:26:00]  I'm really interested to see if that...  You'll get the phone call tomorrow.  Oh, please.  Look at the action.  Oh.  Thanks.  I don't care.  I want to see it.  That's all.  All right, Rick.  Thank you, Brian.  Thank you, Brian.  For your service to this fine radio show.  Let's take a break, regroup, and do something different.  You've got all the tact of a rake.  L.P. and Anthony.  1027.  WNEW.  Bow down before the one you serve. 
[02:26:30]  You're going to get what you deserve.  Bow down before the one you serve.  You're going to get what you deserve. 
[02:27:00]  Go ahead, Keith.  What's up, Keith?  Yeah, well, you're saying how horrible it's to see your mom's boobs.  Yeah, if you inadvertently see your mom's boobs, what?  Seeing your mom and dad do commando on the bed.  Commando?  What happened, Keith?  Oh, God.  I tried to forget it.  What happened?  You walked in on him?  Oh, yeah.  Early Saturday morning.  You opened it?  You just flung the door open?  Opened it.  Was mom taking it from behind or what? 
[02:27:30]  Oh, my God.  Yeah, what was happening?  Yeah, what position were they in, Keith?  Feet over the shoulders.  Whoa.  Wow.  That's the hi-hi you doing.  Is your dad hung?  Huh?  Oh.  Is your dad hung?  Uh, I don't know.  But, like, were they making noise or anything?  It was pretty embarrassing, huh?  My mom's a professional.  She was moaning, huh? 
[02:28:00]  I guess, yeah.  Yeah, that's pretty bad.  And then what happened when they saw you?  Well, their back was kind of facing to me, so I managed to get out.  Oh, they didn't see you?  They didn't ask you to join them?  Oh.  Oh, God.  Oh, man, you got...  Who are you, Rick, today?  Taking it too far?  I took a hit on the head this morning, and I'm terrible.  Think I'm spaz?  Hey, this kid quit.  Even 12-year-olds think I'm on spaz.  So, did you enjoy it? 
[02:28:30]  I mean, was that the first time you've ever seen, you know, people having sex?  Yeah, I guess.  Oh, man.  Has your dad told you about the birds and the bees yet?  Actually, my brother did.  What did he tell you?  Well, it started with this question, what hole does he go into?  My father said, whatever, one's open. 
[02:29:00]  Oh, my God.  Is your dad's name Jackie?  No, not that one.  Oh, my God.  That's funny.  Keith, you're all right, man.  I guess you'll do okay.  All right.  Anything else?  Rather not say.  Okay.  You guys suck.  All right.  So does your mom, Keith. 
[02:29:30]  Call back any time, all right?  Okay.  All right.  There he goes.  Keith, everyone.  He's pretty funny.  He's very funny.  Funny little lad.  Keith's mom is on the line?  Oh, no.  Come on.  No way.  Keith's mom.  Hey, yes.  I'm Keith's mom.  All right.  Now, Keith was...  You sound a lot like Keith.  He caught you and Daddy having sex.  Keith says, I mean, I was unaware of that, but it reminded me, well, first of all, they 
[02:30:00]  deserve whatever they get because they never leave us alone.  And we try to barricade our room.  And if that doesn't work, they hear the bed squeaking.  They take a broom handle and bang on the living room ceiling.  It's a clue I'm saying, yes.  But what I wanted to say was that it reminded me when I heard him on the radio.  Your voice sounds a little hoarse.  Yeah.  Anyway, my nephew one time...  The pink and white owl.  The white owl.  No, I don't smoke cigars. 
[02:30:30]  Oh, yeah, sure.  The cigar.  The brand is called Keith's dad.  What?  Nothing.  Go ahead, Keith's mom.  Anyway, one time my nephew was...  We had my company and my husband, he wanted to have a matinee.  So, what we do is we shut the bedroom door and then we open the closet door so it goes  against the bedroom door.  Barricade it in a little bit.  Right, double door.  And we're having like a final time up there.  And all of a sudden, the kids, I didn't know if they were playing hide and seek. 
[02:31:00]  So was your husband.  Hide the salami.  No, we were...  Yeah, but not that way.  Seat the meat.  Oh, my God.  Listen to her voice.  And we're both pretty big people, you know?  Oh, boy.  Oh, my God.  Oh, boy.  Oh, so poor Keith saw two fat people having sex.  Oh, yeah.  You know, like, is it in? 
[02:31:30]  Listen to her.  Now we know where your son gets his chops from.  I know.  There's one good thing he took.  The comedic family here.  Okay, go ahead.  So, we're up there and all of a sudden, the door, my nephew hit the bedroom door so hard  that the closet door swung shut, the bedroom door opened, and there he was.  Well, I never saw my husband jump off.  He did like a pirouette in the sky and landed on the floor.  So, my nephew, he just went like, oh, sorry. 
[02:32:00]  It's going to make you puke.  No, no.  So, he runs out of the room.  So, now my husband wants to, like, oh, I didn't, you know, I'll just screw you left off.  I was like, no, God, I can't.  I can't now.  You know, like, forget it.  Wait till later.  Oh, man.  You left him hanging?  Yes.  What a messed up family.  You're having sex.  Your kids get to watch you.  Nephews, nieces, whoever the hell wants to open the door.  Hide and seek going on.  You got company downstairs.  You need to screw upstairs.  It was the worst position ever you could have signed so hard. 
[02:32:30]  Uh-oh.  What were you doing?  You were out.  Oh, God.  Oh, my God.  All right.  Hold on.  I don't even know if that made it on the radio.  If that didn't make it on the air, let's just say.  Okay.  Yeah, you could say numbers.  69.  Yeah, okay.  Hold the keys.  So I said, I felt like I had to say something to my nephew.  You know, because I like.  Yeah, all of a sudden the kid had to hanker in for some Arby's roast beef sandwich. 
[02:33:00]  Yeah, well, no.  All you want to feel uncomfortable.  So I just get downstairs and I point to my finger in his face and I just.  Oh.  I said, I hope you have nightmares for the rest of your life.  I will from coming off of that finger.  How much.  How much does mom and dad weigh?  I just need to really picture this right now.  Well, we're very tall.  How much do you weigh?  Well, I'm about two.  All right.  Two bills, huh?  He's about 260.  And you guys are in the 69 position. 
[02:33:30]  Your kids check that out.  No, I'm not few.  Wow.  Hey, but at least I was facing the other way.  Oh, so the kid got the bob shot?  No.  No.  You're traumatizing children.  It's like a hot air balloon shot.  Hey, but this ain't nephew.  This is a few years ago.  But this ain't nephew.  He just got caught by his girlfriend's father.  The upside down hot air balloon shot. 
[02:34:00]  Oh, my son's yelling at me now.  Anyway, I really like your cell over there.  Yeah, everyone likes yours.  My new best friend.  He lives every afternoon.  That is so funny.  Is your son there with you right now?  No, he just went in the other room because he's by the radio.  I'm in the den.  Oh, yeah.  I've been sleeping on the couch.  All right.  We've got to talk to Keith again.  Get him on the phone.  Okay.  Hang on.  Hey, sir.  They want you.  Oh, my God.  Social services. 
[02:34:30]  Please get over there and take those children.  For God's sake.  We just got to keep him on the line for two more minutes.  We'll have the address.  Ella?  Hey, what's up?  Keith.  Did you hear what you were saying on the radio?  Yeah.  That's pretty embarrassing, huh?  Yeah, I guess so.  So your mom's like a big gal?  Oh, yeah.  Yeah?  She did.  And your dad's pretty big.  I look like two pigs fighting over a milk thug.  Keith, you rule, man. 
[02:35:00]  That is funny.  Keith, we've got to go drink beers with you, man.  Oh, man.  Do you know what your mom's favorite number is?  Oh, Keith, you getting in trouble?  Oh, now the motherly of us.  69.  Are you getting in trouble, Keith?  Huh?  Are you getting in trouble?  No.  My mom just said, they'll tell you where we live.  Oh, no.  So, Keith. 
[02:35:30]  Yeah?  Your cousin saw your mom and dad having sex?  Oh, yeah.  What did he say about it?  Yeah, what did he say afterwards?  I don't know.  I was really young, but he had a horrific look on his face.  Oh, man.  That's pretty awful.  Yeah.  You know, you don't want to see that.  But guess what?  What?  Same kid dropped out of high school.  Well, that probably affected him.  He was traumatized.  Yeah.  Yeah.  How old is your mom?  She's around 46. 
[02:36:00]  Yeah, and they're still going at it, huh?  Oh, yeah.  How about that?  It seems like you guys catch them having sex a lot, according to her.  Yeah.  They try locking the door with the closet.  It doesn't work, huh?  Put a chair up against the doorknob.  Yeah.  They make these things called locks, Keith.  Yeah, really.  What about a lock?  My brother has one.  You ever walk in on him?  No.  All right, man.  Well, keep in touch.  I will.  I'd like to know what's happening in the wacky world of your parents. 
[02:36:30]  We're going to need updates, Keith.  All right.  They aren't smoking that wacky tobacco, are they?  I have no idea.  Yeah, you better say that.  Yeah.  Hey, Keith.  Yeah?  Do you have pubes yet?  Oh, jeez.  Whoa.  You always got to go there, man.  It's the bang on the head this morning.  I'm not thinking right.  Yeah.  All right, Keith.  All right.  Well, thanks for calling back.  We're having your mom call us, all right?  All right.  All right.  Bye. 
[02:37:00]  Bye.  There he goes.  The Keith family.  The Keith family. </pre>
