<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast began with the hosts angrily criticizing their own performance and the show's quality, liberally using profanity.  They then transitioned to discussing their upcoming guest, Slash, and the controversy surrounding Guns N’ Roses and Axl Rose's lawsuit.  Jimmy Norton joined the studio, excitedly reviewing Slash's new album, praising its diverse musical styles and the impressive array of guest vocalists, including Fergie, Lemmy, and Chris Cornell.  The conversation shifted to a scathing critique of Stone Temple Pilots' Scott Weiland, contrasting his unprofessionalism (detailed from a Sirius XM special) with Slash's affable nature.  A lengthy segment followed on the iPad, with initial skepticism from Anthony giving way to appreciation for its Netflix streaming capabilities.  The hosts compared it to other devices like iPhones and Kindles, and this led to a discussion of video games, particularly "Red Dead Redemption," which elicited numerous listener calls, including one sharing a humorous anecdote about a "blasphemy" achievement involving a nun and a train.  The show briefly touched on sports (Yankees/Red Sox, Flyers/Canadiens, Celtics/Lakers) before returning to Slash's album and lamenting the absence of Russell Brand due to scheduling conflicts with Howard Stern.  They also analyzed a poorly received interview with George Wendt, focusing on his perceived sadness and discomfort.

The next segment delved into a more personal area, beginning with a discussion of Opie's experience cutting his newborn son's umbilical cord. This launched into a graphic but humorous conversation about umbilical cords, placentas, childbirth, and circumcision, including Opie's own late circumcision and a caller's experience at age 15.  Studio guest Sam then recounted his own circumcision at age 19 to correct phimosis, detailing the procedure and its positive impact on his sexual function.  The discussion became increasingly graphic and humorous. Finally, the segment concluded with anecdotes about Sam's overly doting mother, who exhibited unusual behaviors such as saving Sam's baby hair, collecting wrapping paper, and bringing raw chicken to school events.

The following segment continued the discussion of Sam and his mother, Bobby, focusing on his perceived dependence on her.  Anonymous texts revealed Bobby’s excessive involvement in Sam's life, even as an adult.  Sam's peculiar food dislikes were also highlighted.  Lydia, a medical professional, called in to offer her perspective on their relationship.  The conversation then shifted back to Slash's album, specifically a version of "Paradise City" featuring Fergie and Cypress Hill, which they played a portion of. They also discussed an upcoming episode of *Lost*, revealing some plot points, and an online auction for *Lost* memorabilia.  The segment ended with further discussion of Sam's relationship with his mother.

A charity auction was briefly discussed, featuring items like a hate letter to Bernard, Tom's AZT, a driveshaft ring, and items belonging to Ben and Claire. This transitioned into a news story about two women assaulting a Wendy's employee over condiments, culminating in the use of a stun gun.  A discussion of TV ratings for *Lost*, *Celebrity Apprentice*, and *Survivor* followed, which transitioned to *Hoarders* and the dangers of inhalant abuse, referencing the Drudge Report.  This segment heavily featured an interview with Slash, covering his new album, his experiences working with various guest vocalists (including Ozzy Osbourne, Kid Rock, and Iggy Pop), his collaborations with Cypress Hill, and his experiences with Velvet Revolver and Scott Weiland.  A song from the album was played.  The segment concluded with a story about Eastside Dave, a superfan who attempted to surprise Slash in costume but was thwarted by security.  Dave emotionally recounted his experience meeting Slash and his long-standing fandom.

The final segment revisited Slash's visit, the hosts shared their favorite Slash songs and recounted a Fergie performance.  A heated rant against Bob Guccione Jr. followed, interspersed with Anthony's Axl Rose impersonation and culminating in a vulgar insult.  A caller's question about Anthony's hypothetical choice between saving his son and Axl Rose was clarified.  The discussion covered the real names of Guns N' Roses members and described Slash as a "living, walking cartoon."  Eastside Dave's "worst tattoo ever" of The Sopranos was described in detail, followed by a discussion of Ronnie B's quote and Jay Moore's cancelled radio show. The show concluded with Anthony's vehement criticism of his pool contractor, "Modern Comfort," for shoddy workmanship, detailing his frustrations and his decision to hire a new contractor to fix the discolored and uneven pool finish.

[00:05:00]  sword we could play the bonus track with fergie which one's by the sword chris cornell doing promise  with slash holy shit i'm telling you good this thing is gonna sell itself but yeah you want a little  taste of something what do you want to hear it i don't know i i'm a little partial to chris cornell  hear what he sounds like why do you hate him uh no chris cornell's voice is ridiculous his voice  is great and he's handsome oh he's got striking blue eyes that's the same reason you hate me 
[00:05:30]  exactly and he's not a douchebag yeah exactly you hear what happened with stp yesterday no they only  gave howard like 20 minutes i mean they blew us off which you know that we're done with these  fucking guys and i got a tweet in the middle of the night from some guy all bummed out he's like  you know i hate that you guys are trashing uh the daleo brothers because they're really really cool  dudes i agree those guys are great but their lead singer is fucking it up for everybody yeah 
[00:06:00]  their lead singer is a fucking asshole he's a weenie and uh he he barely gave howard 20 minutes  yesterday and then he was supposed to do other stuff and he just walked out really yeah someone down  the hall knows the whole story he walked out so then the daleo brothers once again are doing the  right thing and you know working hard as uh mr wyland just walked out of the building in the middle  of something wow i just i hate him i really hate him he's a fucking douchebag i really hate him he  really is a douche and i'm not a fan it's like i know the guy's a great singer but it's like so i 
[00:06:30]  acknowledge what this guy tweeted me overnight you're right the daleo brothers don't deserve this  shit you know but you know he's a prick huh he's a fucking prick yeah here's iraq and his dopey  fucking velvet iraq what's funny he's a prick uh here's iraq we love the behind the scenes  shit here at series xm so what happened they did 20 minutes on howard um yeah so they leave howard 
[00:07:00]  they go to another studio to record uh they're supposed to do more time on on stern right what  this was earlier yeah i would assume that late i would assume he would want him for a good hour  get into some shit but i think uh i think you know mr wyland gave him just basic stuff and then  they were supposed to go to another studio to record a special for uh all nation scott apparently went  in grabbed the sheet blew through every liner that they they wrote out put it down and walked  out and left with a manager left the daleo brothers there to do the rest of the special what was 
[00:07:30]  the rest of the special like like what else probably a special i don't know i don't know  what the the content was but he just blew through one page left and then the other guys were still  there with the rest of their management for a while recording other stuff hmm so in and out what a  jerk off yeah and then you got someone like slash who's just fucking fucking cool and had uh way more  success than uh mr wyland no attitude with slash none none people want to hear uh paradise city 
[00:08:00]  i actually haven't heard that i did not hear how do you get to the bonus track uh-oh  that's always that's always rough you got to go to the last track to the end of it and then just  let it play through man there could be some silence because they tried to trick you yeah but uh  track 14 the last track says four minutes and 32 seconds so i don't i don't see where the bonus  track would be because then you click it over and it goes back to track one you gotta uh so where  maybe paradise city isn't on this because probably you know everybody would want their taste 
[00:08:30]  oh maybe it was one of those things they just fucking put out there to help promote this but  it's not actually on the cd well that would suck maybe they do that i was listening to it online last  night there's a there's a youtube video where they give you a sample of every fucking song on this album  and they did paradise city as well so see that's why i didn't hear it because uh i have the it wasn't  the real cd it was a copy of the cd that steve got and he gave us all one yeah all right why don't we  do a little uh just it's good man a little taste of uh promise from slash's new album featuring chris cornell 
[00:09:00]  the first time 
[00:09:30]  the first time i ever saw you  you have that far away look in your eyes  the heavens  and the whole room filled up with light  the cruel world it's gonna try to change you 
[00:10:00]  try to hang you up and dance with your pride  and the lips and tears try to tame you  you  you got to keep your fire burning your fire  promise me  you won't have been  put on your fire  put on your fire  promise me 
[00:10:30]  you won't have been  put on your fire  put on your fire  put on your fire  put on your fire  just a little taste huh  i like it  yeah  chris cornell  that's rocking  yeah as they say rocking  yeah so we'll talk to slash about this uh album today  uh i forgot to mention that uh dave grohl's on this  duff mckagan 
[00:11:00]  oh really  it's an all-star freaking lineup  i hate it to just call up people like that  and get them all together to do something  when you're a nice guy you can do that  yeah  i was thinking about it  i mean slash is a nice guy  so he just  he hasn't pissed anybody off  so he  they probably  you know want to help him out every chance they could get  he's just a nice solid dude  last time he was here he just hung out and played guitar hero with us  yeah  like slash is just hanging out  yeah it's like he doesn't need to prove he's a rockstar by acting like a dick 
[00:11:30]  right  right  is that when  is that the one where danny choked  yeah danny did show  oh danny  that's not true  danny was banjo hero  that's not true at all  yeah danny  danny has an excuse but i don't know  i don't know if we should acknowledge  it's completely legitimate  i don't know if we should acknowledge your excuse on your guitar hero  there was  there was a big delay between the video and the audio that was running through the board  we got to the bottom of that unfortunately after the show  yeah  yeah  whatever happened to that game guitar hero 
[00:12:00]  you know what happened they put they just put way too many variations out  yeah  like they didn't give it enough time  and they just wanted to  it seems like they just wanted to make as much money as possible  it seems that game just dropped off the map  well it's still big it's just like you know  you don't hear about it like you did a year ago even  i mean it did it did kind of change  video like it was like the really not the first but it was the first major major like rhythm based video game  so now everybody's on that train now so  yeah it's kind of hard to differentiate yourself from the pack  yeah  i remember walking in a best buy only a year ago and it's just a wall of guitar hero rock band all that shit 
[00:12:30]  it would take up half the store  i mean they still have a ton of stuff and they're still putting out a lot of uh you know downloadable content all just up out on a weekly basis but between the guitar hero and rock band and then there's band hero dj hero it's just too much shit too many heroes and you know what too like dj hero is a is ridiculously stupid i i i i tried playing it in best buy and i didn't get it either i was just too much shit too many heroes and you know what too  and you know what too like dj hero is a is ridiculously stupid i i i tried playing it in best buy and i didn't get it either i wasn't quite sure about it but i think another thing that people are getting sick of i mean i know i'm getting sick of it because every time a new one comes out now you have a whole plethora of plastic toys filling up your living room 
[00:13:00]  yeah and i just got fucking sick of it i was like i have i had i think at one point in time i had like four or five plastic guitars and two plastic drum sets i'm like i don't and everything breaks it's made like shit i i keep having to buy new shit i'm like fuck this already how many people walk in your house and go danny i didn't realize you had a kid  and you know what they sell i saw it in in a best buy there's actually it's not called a toy chest but that's really what it is it's basically just a box so adults could put their plastic guitars and drum sets inside of it 
[00:13:30]  it's a packing crate shut up oh your toy box it's a rocking packing crate it's a toy chest for adults  yeah it's your adult toy chest i tell you one thing about uh some games though um i was playing a couple on my uh on my ipad yesterday  i was um when did you get that i was what you got an ipad what oh oh yeah yeah yeah yeah so so i was playing 
[00:14:00]  drink the kool-aid why don't you yeah uh let me explain why don't you go drink some more kool-aid have some kool-aid  all right hold on what the hell's wrong with you you can do everything with your iphone and your fucking mac at home  that's what i kept saying and it's uh true but um i didn't buy it  it was a birthday present from the wonderful people at mohegan sun those motherfuckers guys you've  actually made more an apple and computer products than you've gambled 
[00:14:30]  jesus yeah they're really they're really showing the world that uh a gambling addiction is a bad thing  way to show the world that you really shouldn't be a a hardcore gambler do they give you the all right  the wi-fi and the uh 3g one no i just have the wi-fi oh what garbage i know those so they gave you a  nice new ipad yeah and um i gotta say now i i've been the one just uh bashing the uh the ipad you've 
[00:15:00]  been poo-pooing i've been poo-pooing it because i say everything you could do on the ipad you could  do on your iphone or your uh i touch or whatever the hell i think you would you want to do it on  the computer or whatever but there are a couple of things that just ergonomically it seems better  reading websites is like the shit on this thing because it opens the reason you know you no mouse  no click click click scrolling up on pages you're just you just out the pages yeah you're really like 
[00:15:30]  i've seen an action wing it it's it's still kind of cool it's still big it is big see that's the  thing i don't understand why are they going big we spent all these years going small and now they  decide we got to go back to big that's what i don't understand it you can't really conveniently  take it with you unless you have a bag with you so you can't take it out and if you're home you have  a computer did you get the did you get now i don't have an ipad yes because they were sold out when i  went to buy one kool-aid drinking faggot that i am fanboy fanboy went to get one you went for an ipad 
[00:16:00]  yes i did see oh buy apple stock jesus christ all of us fruit but it makes more sense because you do  a lot of traveling i see it as a good traveling tool i'll tell you why i did an everyday tool for  schmucks i don't see it jonathan sold me on it bob kelly bob kelly couldn't have sold me an ipad if  if they fuck if they cured cancer i had it he was an ass jonathan showed me what you do you get the  there's a um a case that comes with it it's like a hard rubber case bob kelly had that one that you 
[00:16:30]  could actually stand so you could stand it up in a triangle and watch it yes and he was showing me  how you can you can but what is it a stream netflix movies on it i was doing that last night it's it's  really good i stream netflix on that thing and i'll tell you something the resolution on the screen  is outstanding yeah it it looks better than a regular computer monitor i do that on my tv  yeah well yeah i know and i mean i'm not leaving my house for the next 18 years so what 
[00:17:00]  you're pretty much you're trapped in front of your television exactly it is cool though i have to  admit jonathan when jonathan went through it i saw why people were like yeah you know what it is actually  fairly cool there there's a weird like i still can't figure out the niche for it but it seems  everybody wants it and and once you you fuck around with a little bit it's it's kind of cool but it is  kind of a weird like why am i going to use this see i like reading books well you could read books 
[00:17:30]  it comes with winnie the pooh i got my kindle and i know the kindle's starting to feel a little old  and a little dated a little dated but you know i walked to a starbucks with my stupid kindle and i  do a little fucking reading the same thing with the goddamn stupid ipad that goddamn book thing you  you could just go to the the bookstore buy any book you want and then download it has a kindle app  it has a kindle app does have a kindle app my issue with the ipad with kindle is the kindle's  great because it's the light doesn't hurt your eyes that fucking computer screen if you're reading  a book on it it really hurts you'll destroy your eyes yeah so unless they can dim the light if they 
[00:18:00]  can dim the light i mean i think the ipad yeah they don't have that on the ipad right so it's like  looking at a computer screen so if you're gonna if you read books on the ipad i think eventually  your eyes are going to be hurt it's gonna hurt but be blinded i've read hundreds of pages on  my kindle in one day no problem with my eyes because they got that technology i don't know  what it's fucking called but yeah it's got what is it it's called e-ink e-ink everything's e or i  it's amazing i was playing a game called uh gears which is uh just kind of a logic game where you have 
[00:18:30]  to slide various gears around or steam pipes together to make a machine work and it just like  it looked really good on the game it's it's a little bit bigger so a lot bit bigger than the  phone so you kind of got more room to fuck around and i'm the one that was just like you know yes  poo-pooing i was poo-pooing you sure were well spectro writes ipad isn't competing with the iphone  it's competing against the laptop so it did get smaller yeah yeah you could pretty much do anything 
[00:19:00]  on the ipad that you could do on a no i mean basic stuff not really it's kind of in between it's an  odd thing but i do like the goddamn that netflix feature i i pop a netflix app on also the e-trade  app uh i i do all my e-trade stuff usually on my phone because i'm out and about but the e-trade app  on this thing is so much more intuitive there's so much more shit on the screen uh and information  uh it's it's amazing uh you know i'm not completely like wow blown away like i was when i first got the 
[00:19:30]  iphone it was just like holy shit this is you know the future and everything but they got something  going on there not that i have to tell anybody they're selling millions it's gonna be i'm telling  you it's going to be it's where everything's going in in five or six years like jonathan told me and  this is probably what i would do if you're going away for one night you can bring your ipad with you  but if you're going away for two or three nights you got to have your laptop but one night you could 
[00:20:00]  because it's hard the ipad it's like the iphone you can't you can't like you know a and like type on  it with both hands because you're it's just you have to buy it as your keypad i'm a hunt and peck  guy oh i am still so i have no problem just going i could i could type pretty quick like i do on my  iphone oh i do it i do it i have both hands down and i can type like a 50 year old woman my name  should be edna norton so you get to buy a little bluetooth computer uh they have bluetooth oh keyboard 
[00:20:30]  keyboards for but aren't they're not big yeah yeah you get the ones that roll up or something  because i know they got those you don't like those either i haven't seen those yeah they're  like rubber but that's too much shit roll up it's much smaller all the accessories to it  well that's just it like i don't know how to carry it around what are you doing like like how do you  use it as a back brace when you're not using it you just shove it in the back of your pants yeah  you'll stand up straight your posture will be wonderful posture gets better and then if you need  be you just pull it out and use it wipe off all the back sweat off the screen and  you're good to go well according to bob the way you carry is dude boom book bag pow okay alarm boom

[00:26:00]  i'm a gunsmith yeah travis is very upset that you took his job yeah well i sold the guns in in gta 4  you stay in ammunition i'm fucking old west gunsmith  i uh was supposed to be in that uh game what happened i finally called lazlo back and it was  a little too late and he said he had a really good role for me oh shit i'm such an idiot how come he  never called me yeah i'm very good with the west he uh he called me a lot he said he had a perfect  fucking uh character for me now i now i need to know what character i was supposed to be i just got

[00:27:30]  different because nobody's really ever done like a like a western game like that before  and you can i mean there's like hookers that are getting stabbed in the stomach you know it's just  like the random stuff they have in there is just there's enough stuff in there just for a random  game without even following the the actual storyline yeah that you can play for just days and days and  days we're watching danny how you're watching a bit of a trailer how how close is that to the way  it really looks that's it that's how it looks it's a fucking video that's in game that's in game 
[00:28:00]  yeah it's sick the muscles on the horses move wow that's in game that looks like a video because  that's how they used to trick you when you see something like that yeah it wasn't in game  yeah you saw you'd see the cut they would show cut scenes and you go wow this game you thought  it was in game footage and now you know the in game stuff looks just as good as the cut scenes  no kidding yeah laszlo will talk all about this game tomorrow give us uh the ins and outs so  fuck man yeah yeah birds yeah the the details the the particles like they got dust that comes up 
[00:28:30]  when the horses are running and explosions and just really cool just the way everything moves they  said this what they did was each thing was uh it's not like canned like canned animation it's all like  individual so like when someone like if you shoot a guy off of uh off of a horse and he gets like  stuck in the stirrup like the way his body moves is like physically exactly how it would be if he  were to fall but it's not the exact same for every guy yeah yeah they got those random uh ragdoll  physics i love that right you know what's amazing i'm watching right now is the camera angles on this 
[00:29:00]  it's like a film like they're showing you it's it's from the ground like you're seeing really weird  camera angles on this zooming in this is like it's like a fucking movie that you can just shoot  people in yeah wow fantastic can't wait to play this like i i have to go to work time on fireman  so i gotta work a 24-hour shift time this is i have to wait another 24 hours oh how great is that  that's when you know you're playing a good game that's when you know you're hooked all right  tommy thanks for the call see you time wow let's go to mike on long island mike mike  hey and what's up did you know about the hbo go uh for your verizon files that you can stream hd

[00:31:30]  talk uh the fcc just announced that they're giving the rights for um for uh movie companies and stuff to  have movies sent digitally right through your cable lines right to your homes but before uh dvds are  released so if that happens you know whenever there's a movie that comes out that you like  you know within a few weeks you can just get it sent right to your house yeah i i don't know why  that technology took so damn yeah so damn long do they fix the phones well it's one step closer to 
[00:32:00]  cutting out movie theaters which is going to happen eventually of course yeah that's going to be a  thing of the past if you if you could download music you should be able to just download any movie  you want i don't know what they're waiting for i don't understand what that's all about with  people's uh televisions and entertainment centers and stuff getting better and better  i mean did you ever as a kid you never thought uh driving movies would go away now they're they're  just gone they're a novelty item yeah you'll go see one in the town which just hey just to say we  still got a drive-in that's what's gonna happen with movie theaters yeah you know what i what the

[00:33:00]  apart wow just to correct that uh caller it's the dastardly achievement oh dastardly so you're like  dick uh dastardly there's none on the tracks watching her old school train coming in the  distance he's just watching his horse is watching his horse is watching his horse is watching look at  the horse on the horse move back and forth the horse is very natural move oh and and then she just 
[00:33:30]  comes did the horse get it too uh-oh i think he left his horse on the tracks i think the horse got  it oh damn looks like the horse got it for a second when the horse is standing there though  its ears are moving like randomly and it ducks its head down and does little horsey things  people used to get tied to train tracks i forgot it i forgot that was a method that's horrible isn't it  what an awful way to get fucked up oh god you just feel the rumbling and hear it coming

[00:35:00]  walking on flashlights to catch you you know it was fucking fun man and yeah you'd put your friends  in the trunk of your car like a fucking tarantino movie you pull it to the theater and then you got  to look around and pop the trunk and let them out how old are you that's like a 1950s thing oh it was  great it was like american graffiti we'd go cruising we'd go to mel's diner did you squeeze into phone  booths too yeah see how many could get in there see how many people you get in the phone booth it  was great eating goldfish unbelievable hey uh big sports night as we change gears uh don't forget 
[00:35:30]  laszlo will be in tomorrow to talk more tech shit and uh talk about this fine new game from rock star  thank you java chamberlain for blowing the fuck did he blow it yeah yeah red sox uh beat your yankees  came back from a five-run deficit to beat the yanks seven six oh there's nothing worse than when  a bullpen fucking shits the bed that's the worst part rivero you can forgive because he's rivero and  you know he's human a bullpen shits the bed it is in i don't know why it's more enraging than 
[00:36:00]  anything yeah because you had it the guys had it they did the job with the bats that happens  when you play 198 games a year it'll happen a few times jesus yeah stupid mets lost to the braves  but uh let's uh all look at travis his uh habitants aren't doing too well in the playoffs  with the flyers there what's happening they haven't even trying to well we've yet to score  a goal in the first two games yeah they haven't even scored a goal yeah we gotta fly shut them 
[00:36:30]  out again well they wait why are they not is it a strategy yeah we're gonna score all of them in  the third game yes are you trying for another one of these miracle fucking come back from the brink  disaster i can't take another one a little nerve-wracking the flyers just look great  you know what they're just on the canadians weren't supposed to go this far anyway we weren't  even supposed to be in the playoffs you're having a fine run we're just proud to be here and no you  want to win then again the flyers the flyers weren't supposed to get this far the flyers wanted  to shoot out at the end of the season that's right let's not forget that uh so the flyers get the 
[00:37:00]  two uh two game lead there over the habitants the canadians and the blackhawks have a two game lead  over the sharks huh and then basketball anyone the celtics that's right they seem to be uh doing  very well well uh maybe a little celtics fucking uh lakers showdown old school why not let's go old  school just love watching the uh watching the celtics with the the little the little shamrock on the back 
[00:37:30]  of their uniform and such irish colors from such an irish town and oh my god those are the  biggest blackest people i've ever seen in my life it is a very strange combination it really is  leading a little shamrock i challenge you to come up with a stranger combination in sports  than very black black guys wearing a fucking celtics uniform it would it would be like a team named  the zulus that are just all white businessmen it's just it's that ironic yeah it's pretty bad 
[00:38:00]  yeah it's like they're all wearing green because they're green with envy hey why don't we take a  break uh let's not forget slash is coming in today fucking we'll be here at 9 30 you want to want to  play a just a little taste of another track i really i love the kid rock track loved it not a lot of kid  not a lot of kid rock fans um you know what i love this track i really did where did kid rock lose like  his credibility like kid rock had some major league rock and credibility and then uh i think that whole 
[00:38:30]  rap rock thing just disappeared yeah it just ended everybody got sick of it but he changed  he's been doing mostly he's been touring with skinner so i think he's kind of been lumped in with  them kind of southern rock he changed and then he had that huge hit with uh cheryl crow yeah  oh love songs that did with cheryl crow might have done that's what people are saying yeah i like him  better like this actually i like i like him better as a as a guy who sings southern rock  i don't like the rap stuff you like the bob with a bar what's that fucking love that song with a bar 
[00:39:00]  which was that whole fucking album that was a good one what's that track rocks breakout uh  song that was a song that was like really yeah it's a little midget oh remember he had his midget  got his name something joe josey right josey josey little josey you don't know bar with a bar  and rap rock is not dead if you guys haven't heard the new the new icp song oh no icp is trying  to come back you don't know this one jimmy come on as soon as he kicks it yeah this song i'm gonna 
[00:39:30]  back in that one yeah yeah okay i just hit another name this song makes you drive really fast no i like  it does it's good i like the way he he does it the words are pretty cool you know and he introduces  himself he goes my name is kid yeah  yeah exactly 
[00:40:00]  yeah  right good shit  this just makes you want to kill people yeah it makes you want to kill people  yeah you don't want to drop a boogie it's very cute 
[00:40:30]  you don't like it no you don't like the boogie it's not it's actually good but it's not my style  and this is for the questions that don't have any answers the midnight glancers at the top  is dancers the candor freaks cars packed with speakers the g's with the 40s and the chicks with  beepers the northern oops that's good shit come on it's dated a little retro it's dated  chicks with beepers oops you can fade this out travis i like the new one better i like his new  thing with the slash we're asking where it went wrong for kid rock someone goes his faggy all 
[00:41:00]  summer long song is a piece of dog shit but he had lost it before that all summer long that came  out last year or two summers when they did the sweet home alabama on there it's okay you got a  little piece of all summer long there yeah travis we're trying to figure out when he lost his uh  his crack plus he hasn't been associated with a uh this is famous chick this is okay little warren  zvon riff here yeah yeah you like this one better than bob with a box he was outside of the uh 
[00:41:30]  cafe wally the night he's in the city he's a great guy yeah he's on the show a bunch of times  another guy that forgot about us when he got really famous what's wrong this is fine i don't  mind this one yeah and this was pretty big hit for him huge this is this crossover stuff because  this was being played on like country stations and shit  yeah a little skinner alabama there all right enough of this one too travis yeah enough of 
[00:42:00]  this one thanks all right we it brings us to today he's doing a track off slash his new album slash  coming in at the question is who isn't doing a track on slash his new album he's fucking got  everybody jimmy norton besides me he asked me i was busy i was busy here's slash with kid rock doing  i hold on as we go to break a little just a little taste we're not playing the whole thing today  i feel your comfort in my dreams 
[00:42:30]  unprotected silent screams  a light beyond your shadow beams  still i don't know what it means 
[00:43:00]  when seasons change  memories remain  i hold on because i won't let go  even though i know there's solitude below  i hold on because i can't let go 
[00:43:30]  and i refuse to let the hands of favor fall  the opie and anthony show  the virus on sirius xm  yeah this is off slash his new album 
[00:44:00]  And By the Sword is the name of the song.  The name of the CD is just called Slash.  And this is the dude from Wolf Mother.  Well, I don't think we're going to hear him.  I think we're just talking over the music right now to get back into the show. 
[00:44:30]  Man, it's such a good CD.  And I don't mind promoting the hell out of it because Slash is a great guy.  Yeah.  He's just a great guy, a stand-up guy.  Has never blown us off, which leads me to today's blow-off.  It's a new feature on the Opie and Anthony show.  Guest bookings that don't happen.  Yesterday it was STP.  STP.  And today it's Russell Brand.  I'm sad to say that Russell Brand will not be doing the Opie and Anthony show today, 
[00:45:00]  which is very strange because when no one knew who Russell Brand was when he was coming up,  we had him on.  We had him on two or three times, I believe.  I think twice in studio.  And I think we also did a phoner with Russell Brand.  And now he's fucking huge.  Is he in the building or no?  He's doing Howard.  So, you know.  Yeah.  But I talk to these idiots down the hall and they don't see that there's an actual problem with the bookings for the Opie and Anthony show.  Really?  Here's a guy that has done our show a bunch of times. 
[00:45:30]  And I think Sirius XM's got to start playing hardball with some of these guys because they have a lot to offer in this building, right?  So you go, hey, man.  You have to do Opie and Anthony as well.  You're friends with those guys.  Radio friends, you know.  Yeah.  Radio friends.  So we're not going to have Russell Brand on, which is pretty sad.  Because when no one knew him in Forgetting Sarah Marshall, we had him on.  And he gave us great radio.  And we had him on all the way up until he was hosting the MTV, what was it, the movie awards and the music awards? 
[00:46:00]  Once he did that, that put him over the top, kind of.  And now he's got a new movie coming out.  And, well, we don't get him.  Roland told me the movie is fantastic.  It's really, really good.  Really, really good.  You know, Roland, who really wants to work for this show badly.  They have an opening here at Sirius XM.  And they've completely blown me off as far as what's going on with Roland and hiring him.  They're not going to hire him.  And hiring him.  I know they're not going to.  They're just avoiding us because they know they're not going to hire him for whatever reason. 
[00:46:30]  We love the fucking guy.  And we believe he could get some guests on this show that maybe other people can't.  But what do we know?  So last time Russell Brand was in, I did my stupid bit like, well, we won't see you again.  And everyone laughs like, oh, come on, that's stupid.  It happens all the fucking time.  And this is what I said to Russell Brand last time he was in.  It's quick.  Well, thank you very much for having me on your radio show.  I appreciate it. 
[00:47:00]  No problem.  We love Russell Brand.  But he's on a rocket ship.  Another one of these guys we'll never see you again.  I'll be in.  I like it, yeah.  The two or three times you've been on our show have been terrific.  Thank you.  I mean, now you're going to be a huge movie star.  You're going to be in every other movie.  All right.  Thanks, Russell Brand.  Thanks, chaps.  Thanks for having me.  Thanks, buddy.  Cheers.  I appreciate that.  There you go.  I'm going to see you.  I told him.  He didn't deny it.  No, I know he didn't deny it.  He didn't deny it.  That's for sure.  I know.  So we have to add him to the list of guys that used to do our show.  Then they get too big and they don't do our show anymore. 
[00:47:30]  Yeah.  I don't know why that has to be.  I don't get it.  Because we're at the bottom of the entertainment food chain as far as doing shows to promote  your movies.  That's pretty much it.  If these guys are coming in and having a good time, why wouldn't they come back to  help promote their projects on a platform where they know they had a good time?  I think having a good time takes a backseat to business and, oh, let's, you know, they  listen to their publicists and everything.  No, we won't do that. 
[00:48:00]  We'll do this.  You know.  Obviously, everybody that does satellite radio, they're going to go, well, you got to go  on Howard and then we'll take you over to fucking, you know, Channel 5 and then we'll  take you over to here.  Before the merger was, you have to do Opie and Anthony.  Merge.  We were the big dogs for XM.  Now we're just one of the shows here.  That's just wonderful.  Yeah.  That doesn't hurt too much from where we came from.  The way it works is, and I've gotten into do press in other places, it is not Russell  blowing the show off. 
[00:48:30]  I would say it's virtually 85% of the time it's not the artist.  Because the way it works is you go there and your publicist tells you, all right, you  got KXRQ.  Here's what you got, 7, 740, 720, you got Stern, GMA, and this.  And he'll just go and do the shows.  It's not a conscious thing by the artist.  It's the people behind the scenes making the schedule.  Because I do press on the road.  It's usually not a personal thing by the artist.  You're not thinking.  We did try to get a hold of Russell on his Twitter there.  And, you know, he didn't write anyone back.  Oh, really?  He knows we're looking for him. 
[00:49:00]  And, you know.  Oops.  I think he knows our names from the few times he did do our show.  He's not on the fuck-o list.  It's just what happens with these guys.  The fuck-o list.  I forgot we had a fuck-o list.  Even George Wendt doesn't go on the fuck-o list.  George?  Do you hear that fucking painful interview?  Yeah.  And people were, like, mad saying that I was allowing my personal.  I really wasn't.  I wasn't trying to pin this guy as an alky.  But he walked in. 
[00:49:30]  No.  I thought he was fucking a little sluggish.  What am I going to talk to him about?  So, tell us all about Amstel Light.  Dude.  I thought he wanted to shoot himself.  He looked like he was in the middle.  In between being really fucking drunk and hungover.  That middle fucking period?  I don't know.  But he was a wreck.  I thought he looked sad.  He looked extremely sad, extremely tired, and possibly very hungover or drunk.  I don't know.  I was sitting right next to him, and I did take a look at his eyes.  And they were, I've seen that in the mirror plenty of times. 
[00:50:00]  They were very red and glassy.  And he was giving off the vibe like he probably had just woken up.  And his book was all about beer.  So, what were we supposed to do?  It's all cheers tie-in.  What I wanted to avoid, because I thought, like, this is George Wendt.  I want to treat the guy well.  I don't want to be a douche.  George is attempting to do a Zucro interview, like an upbeat.  So, George, the beer.  You knew it was going to be a very slow, kind of trudging, if that's a word, interview. 
[00:50:30]  Plotting.  Plotting is the word.  Yes.  Thank you, everybody.  You knew it was going to be a plotting.  And I didn't want to see him throwing out, like, little beer quips that were going to bomb.  Like, you know what I mean?  I'm like, you know, Bud Light, but, you know, I'm not light.  Whatever it was, he would have said.  I said, sometimes you want to just talk to somebody.  See, Chip Wendt?  Might as well be.  Yeah, cheers.  That's what they say to me when it's in a booze.  Might as well be.  The book was. 
[00:51:00]  Yeah, I don't.  I didn't mean it.  I guess there's an audience out there for a 200-page book on beer quips.  Why?  Is it a quib or a quip?  It's a quip.  Quip.  Beer quips.  But wasn't it interesting to hear, like, to me, what you wanted to learn is, like, the  guy was talking about being on Cheers and, you know, maybe having, like, not as much money.  And he was like, yeah.  Like, he kind of.  Well, that's what you kind of want to hear from him.  Like, obviously, everyone knows him from Cheers.  Talk about maybe some behind-the-scenes stuff. 
[00:51:30]  The cast changes.  When Woody Harrelson came on.  Like, there's just different things you could talk about, I guess.  I wish I was.  I should have actually thought of that.  Nah.  What do you have?  No, sorry.  No.  We weren't here.  No.  The guy was not easy.  Because we did try to go down some of those fucking roads.  And he just had nothing for us.  Absolutely nothing.  I wasn't saying that's what you should have done.  I'm saying, like, that's what I think would have, like.  We tried to go in a lot.  Like, it probably wouldn't have worked either.  A caller had called in with some Cheers.  Yeah, no.  We went down all those roads, trust me, to get him going. 
[00:52:00]  He had nothing.  He wasn't interested in it.  This guy had nothing for the show.  He was really, yeah.  But I don't think he was being a jerk-off.  I didn't want to be nasty to him.  I just wanted to talk.  Because, like, look, I'm honest.  I'll talk to you about what's going on.  And, I don't know, I guess I expect the same amount of other people.  We mentioned Kirstie Alley and Ted Danson.  Thank you, sir.  And Woody Harrelson.  He had nothing on any of those people.  He had nothing.  I even asked him about television today, like sitcoms today.  Are they soft?  You know, well, yeah.  I have nothing. 
[00:52:30]  It was kind of like a Pat Munaki without material.  Oh, yeah.  We all know Pat has his material.  But he had kind of that, like.  Yes.  Yes.  You have to start calling him George from Munaki.  Let's say how to Rocco in Jersey.  Rocco.  Dude.  Hey, what's up?  Yo, I caught STP on Howard Stern.  And they were fucking awful.  I don't think they were as bad as George went.  But they were fucking all strung out.  And they couldn't answer questions. 
[00:53:00]  And Howard was just fucking.  He had to try so hard to make the interview any good at all.  But you guys were better with Tattoo Talk.  Yeah, we did better with Tattoo Talk yesterday.  Well, you know.  I mean, I guess what were we going to do with STP in the end?  Dude, Scott Weiland just seems.  He's everything I fucking hate in a performer.  I mean, it makes me.  I mean, again, the guy's very talented.  And I'm not saying rock stars can't be loon sometimes.  Like, Tommy Lee's a lunatic. 
[00:53:30]  But he's not a dick.  If you're interesting, crazy, that's fine.  It actually works for you.  Right.  But if you're a fucking prick douchebag.  Well, he doesn't want to be in the radio station.  He doesn't want to be here.  That's the problem.  You'll be good with Slash, guys.  Good luck.  Yeah, no, Slash will be really good today.  Absolutely.  People saying that George went sounded okay over the radio.  But to see him, you know, obviously they couldn't see what we were saying.  Right, of course.  But I didn't take it as him.  The guy's saying how he works out. 
[00:54:00]  I'm like, what?  When?  Where?  Doing the bottle curls.  Get it?  Beer?  I actually said, when are you going to start that program?  He said, well, I've done it.  I'm like, what?  I think he was talking about putting the weight.  Like, he didn't strike me.  And again, this is how dumb I am.  He didn't strike me as drunk.  He struck me as just tired and sad.  He really struck me as a guy at the moment, at least, who is very, very sad.  Well, you come down from, you know, a lot of drinking, right?  Yeah.  The next day after a lot of drinking, you get a little of that sadness.  And how about come down from, you know, one of the most popular shows ever on television 
[00:54:30]  to just not even like his buddy there doing voices of cartoon characters on Pixar movies.  Toy Story, right?  Yeah.  You're just kind of, huh?  So I asked him about the money.  How is it?  Is it good?  And he goes, you know, he's got five kids, so it's more expensive than he thought college.  It's like, what are you going to talk about?  I don't know what people would have expected that.  But it wasn't like, hey, let's talk about alcohol because that's my thing.  It was the vibe of the thing.  He was fucking, guy came in like he was a funeral dirge.  There's always so much he could do.  Yeah. 
[00:55:00]  So really, you know, your butt or Bud Light?  He couldn't even name it.  Nobody knows my name.  Cheers.  Cheers.  He couldn't even name his favorite beer.  Dude.  And then I'm like, all right, how about five of your favorite beers?  He didn't even want to commit to his favorite beer.  His whole book is about beer.  Isn't he used to walking in the room and probably all the radio guys going, Norm. 
[00:55:30]  And he sits down, right?  Did you do that?  No.  Did you go, Norm.  No.  That might have gotten his spirits up, right?  No.  Just like the show.  Oh, wow.  This guy, Frank.  Jesus, Frank.  What's up?  Oh, Frank was better.  Come on, Frank.  Oh, Frank was better.  Frank, what do you got, buddy?  Frank. 
[00:56:00]  Jimmy, you're an honest guy.  You talk about what you do.  You're a demon.  You know, he prostitutes all that stuff, right?  And then you get pissed when other people don't want to talk about it.  I wasn't.  Not everyone.  All right, go ahead.  But, Frank, I wasn't mad.  I wasn't mad at him.  I got to back Jimmy up, too.  Jimmy wasn't mad.  I didn't abuse him.  No, I didn't say you did, Jimmy.  But yesterday and this morning, you say, well, the guy wasn't honest.  I'm being honest with him.  Why can't he be honest?  Not everyone's comfortable being that honest.  You're right.  Frank is right.  But I'm saying, I wasn't saying I'm being honest. 
[00:56:30]  He should be.  If his mood was different, Frank.  Like, if he had come in kind of like, hey, guy, like feeling a bit more upbeat, it would  have been easier and more natural to flow into a silly chat about beer in the book.  If he came in like a John Candy type guy.  Yeah.  You know what I mean?  Just all happy-go-lucky.  But we would have fun with him.  It was hard to.  I know.  I agree that he came in kind of like a sad sack.  Like, he definitely sounded like a depressed dude.  No doubt about it.  Yeah.  Like, you were kind of like, I'll use the word prodding.  Like, oh, well, how about the drinking and the weight? 
[00:57:00]  And you're asking me these questions.  And you could tell, just from his answers, like, dude, I'm not comfortable going into  this with you.  Honestly, he mentioned the weight first, Frank.  He mentioned the weight, like, he said something about obesity.  And then I went with it because he meant, and I'm like, well, is that a thing for you?  Have you tried to?  Because he mentioned it, so I just kind of grabbed what he mentioned.  But I never would have just mentioned his weight if he didn't mention it first.  Look, just to take you inside the, you know, inside the show a little bit.  There are times, like, a guest will leave and we realize, fuck, we should have taken 
[00:57:30]  a different angle or try this or try that.  Absolutely.  In this case, we did everything we could.  He was the Kobayashi Maru of interviews.  We weren't going to get anything done with him yesterday.  I agree.  You guys definitely, like, tried to work an angle with him, and he wasn't giving you  much to work.  Like, dude, bottom line, he was a crappy guest because he just wasn't feeling it.  But, like, Jimmy, you just kept saying, like, well, I'm an honest guy about this and  that.  And it seemed like you were, and maybe you were, maybe you weren't.  It just seemed like you were, that the dude wasn't honest about his demons, where not 
[00:58:00]  everyone feels that way.  You know what I mean?  Yeah, no, but I honestly, I'll tell you, honestly, I was not mad at him.  I didn't want to, quote, unquote, beat him up or attack him.  I was only, it's like sometimes when you're talking to somebody, I find, and I guess this  is maybe program training, that if I talk about myself, and it's not out of arrogance,  but it's like, it makes somebody else more relaxed and it shows them, like, look, I'm  being forthcoming, so I don't want you to think that I'm here just digging at you, trying  to get you to emotionally fucking throw it all up and then just take what I can get from  me.  It's like, I understand it, and I'm willing to put myself out a little bit, too.  That's kind of why I do that. 
[00:58:30]  All right.  I get it.  All right.  Good talk, guys.  All right, Frank.  Thank you.  But no, I wasn't mad at the guy, man.  And if he had come in, don't forget with other guys that come in that are actors or whatever,  if they're talking about their project and they're kind of feeling good, then you don't go  down that road because it's not natural.  And the whole interview didn't sound like an intervention, only a big chunk of it.  But when a guy writes about beer and comes in looking sad, how do you not?  You've got a show called, about a bar.  Sad.  He looks sad.  Yeah. 
[00:59:00]  How do you not talk about it?  He's like, I think at one point he's like, wow, you guys are really talking about beer  a lot.  I'm like, well, your fucking book is all about beer.  Your whole career was based on you with a beer in front of you.  Yeah.  I really don't know what else to ask you, sir.  How do you go upbeat with that?  Every picture we're finding on Google Images, he has a beer in his hand.  He's got a beer in his hand.  The interesting thing about Google Images is that there's a lot of George Wendt photos,  especially on the first page.  And he looks miserable for the most part in a lot of these photos because I'm looking at 
[00:59:30]  some recent pictures.  And he'll have a smirk or you could tell he's just smiling for the camera.  And the only picture where he genuinely looks like he's having a good time is when he's really  drinking.  He's having beer.  In this photo, he's at a bar.  He's got people around him.  He's got a beer in his hand, which has been drank a little bit.  And it looks like he's genuinely having a good time.  And then you look at a photo, if this ever works, come here, like this.  And you could just tell he's miserable.  He doesn't want to be in that picture with some ass.  Yeah, George Wendt, where'd he go? 
[01:00:00]  Chip's on fire today.  Is he?  Fucking A.  Let's go to Tom in Pennsylvania.  Tom.  Good morning.  Happy birthday, Yemi.  Thank you, Tom.  Everyone's been overshadowed by this George Wendt incident.  Now, the reason we got Tom on the phone, you're the guy, right?  Yes, sir.  Fuck.  I've been dreading this phone call for a while.  Go ahead, Tom.  Well, you remember a couple weeks ago, I called up with a suggestion of kind of like a shop  vac to suck up the oil. 
[01:00:30]  And you guys had a grand old time laughing your asses off, right?  Yes, I did, sir.  And guess what we're doing this very instant?  I don't know, sir.  You want to tell us?  Yeah, they got a funnel with a nice, long, mile-long hose sucking up the oil.  Yeah.  Yeah, this guy.  Yeah, we beat you up pretty good, didn't we, Tom?  We laughed and laughed at your stupid idea, and it's exactly what they're doing to keep 
[01:01:00]  this oil from leaking into the Gulf.  So how do you feel?  Real proud of yourself, I bet.  Not proud of myself.  I'm just a realist.  What do we do about the economy, huh?  Yeah.  Why don't you help everybody out, Mr. Know-it-all?  I don't say know-it-all.  I'm good at some things, but I'd be smart enough to find someone who did.  You pretty much just said, put a big giant straw down to the oil leak and suck up the oil, right? 
[01:01:30]  We openly laughed at you.  Yeah.  That's right.  We basically called you a dunce.  Right.  And, well, look at Apollo 13.  Don't bring back that word, dunce.  Well, you know, Apollo 13, they had duct tape, and they used what they had, right?  Look, we saw the movie.  Everyone did.  All right.  Don't make it sound like you're breaking new ground here.  All right.  Well, you know, I saw that as a quick fix, and so did someone finally.  Nobody wants to hear your thought process.  You know, I originally, no one gives a turkey. 
[01:02:00]  How do you fix your high, girly voice?  Exactly.  How do you make your testicles drop someday?  Why can't we just give it to them?  I know.  We don't like being wrong.  I know.  We don't like being wrong, Tom.  That's why we've got to find something else that is wrong with you.  Oh, there's plenty there, but you know what?  You can look in the mirror, too, but we've all been there, right?  Ah, yeah.  I'm looking for the man in the mirror. 
[01:02:30]  Yes.  All right, Tom.  Hey, Opie, congratulations on your baby.  Oh, thank you, man.  Pieces of the baby are falling off right now, which is a very good sign.  Oh, God.  You know, the umbilical cord that you have to cut, and then they...  Already they put that little...  They put that thing on.  Clamp?  They put the potato chip clamp on it, basically.  A bag chip?  Yeah.  And they go, all right, this thing will fall...  Shut up.  This thing will fall off in 10 days or so, 10 days to two weeks, and it's starting to  fall off, little pieces of it.  Ew. 
[01:03:00]  Yeah, it's disgusting.  But I guess we'll see an actual belly button in the next day or two.  Yeah?  Yeah.  It's open, and you cut it, right?  Yeah, I cut it there, Tom.  I did not want to.  I don't mind doing all that crazy stuff, but, I mean, when it felt like a ligament, and it  felt like I had bad scissors, like rusty scissors in my hands, it wasn't the experience I was  thinking it was supposed to be.  Safety scissors.  Yeah.  I hear you, but I'll tell you what, I got three kids of my own, and I cut all three of them.  Yeah. 
[01:03:30]  And, you know, my oldest now is 15, and you look back, and you never forget it.  Why?  Why is that supposed to be...  I don't get why that's supposed to be some cool thing that fathers are supposed to look  forward to or whatever, or take in.  Well, the way I see it was the final act of separation and making that individual...  Oh, don't be so symbolic.  Come on.  Final act of separation.  Are you kidding me?  That umbilical cord is like that fucking tube going down to the oil that you're so proud of. 
[01:04:00]  Exactly.  It's nothing.  Enough about the tube.  I guess.  I guess some people see it that way.  I saw it as like, look, I'm paying you.  You cut the fucking cord.  I'll make sure everyone's okay in this room.  I don't need to worry about cutting the cord with the fucking rusty scissors.  You can look at it the other way, that you're cutting the cord and introducing him to this  suck-ass thing called fucking life.  Yeah, you're stealing him from mother.  Yeah, the nice warm womb where you're just hanging out, floating around, and then because 
[01:04:30]  you cut the cord, now the kid's got to...  Now, any time a baby's born and you cut the cord, you start the tick-tock death clock.  Jesus.  What's wrong with you here?  Well, that's what it is.  Everyone dies.  Why don't you like life today?  What's going on with you?  What?  How about this?  It's just life.  You're down on life right now.  I'm down on life every day.  I just, you know...  Yeah, that's kind of what it looks like.  Oh, God.  What is that?  Looking at a picture of you.  It looks like something.  I can't figure it out.  A nice little ribbon you put in your hair. 
[01:05:00]  It looks like when you put too many different colored silly putties together.  It looks like entrails.  Play-Doh.  Problem is, it looks like it would cut nice.  No.  Nice and easy.  The weird thing is this.  The umbilical cord...  Yeah, that's how they send you home.  Oh, gee, thanks.  With this thing hanging where his belly button's going to be.  It's got a sausage casing coming out of him.  And that thing, that's a nice picture of it, by the way, Danny.  That turns fucking black as black as your sweatshirt you're wearing today, Jimmy, as Jimmy  wears a Kiss sweatshirt.  Oh, God. 
[01:05:30]  And then it starts rotting, falling off in pieces, which is happening right now.  Don't some people save it?  Oh, yeah, they do.  Like, they'll put it in the freezer and save it?  Why?  Well, they save...  Well, I don't know if they save...  I know they save the placenta.  You're allowed to take that home, I guess, or you used to be able to take it home.  What do you do with it?  Ah, most people fucking bury it and use it as fertilizer to fertilize a tree or something.  Some people cook it.  Some people cook it and eat it.  Cook that shit up.  I eat it.  I eat that shit.  Yeah, we could do a placenta break if you want.  People will explain it to you. 
[01:06:00]  How does the umbilical cord work?  Like, you fucking breathe through your nose and mouth, but not for the first X amount  of months.  You're looking at that?  That's what it looks like right now.  That's what I'm looking at every fucking day when I'm changing diapers.  It's like someone wiped a booger on a baby.  Oh, fuck.  And then that...  We're looking at it.  It's black, right?  And then it just starts flaking off.  So by the weekend, I think I'm going to see a nice brand new belly button on my son.  I think you're going to just tear it off.  It's time.  Flick it.  Flick it.  Oh, yell at the kid.  Pull that off. 
[01:06:30]  Flick.  Oh, fuck.  Come on.  Stop it.  How are you eating?  How do you breathe through the fucking cord in your belly button?  How does it work?  You don't breathe.  You're in water.  That's for the nutrients, I think.  Yeah.  But how do you breathe?  Whatever mommy's eating, it goes through the air.  Your bloodstream is the same.  You only breathe to oxygenate your blood.  So mommy's breathing oxygenates the blood, and it goes into your umbilical cord and through  your body.  Is that why you breathe?  Yeah, that's the only reason why you breathe is to turn your blood nice and bright red oxygenated, 
[01:07:00]  and then your little cells take it away, and it turns like bluish, and then it goes back  around through your lungs, and you breathe in, and it turns red again.  Wait, is blood red and oxygen blue?  Inside your body?  It's blue.  Yeah, it is.  I hear it's not.  It's red in the arteries.  It's blue in the veins.  After it dumps off the oxygen to the cells, because all your cells need oxygen, so the red blood  goes, and it goes into the capillaries and dumps the oxygen into the cells, and then  it comes back through the veins to run through the circulatory system, go into the lungs, 
[01:07:30]  and then when you inhale, the cells go, ah, I got oxygen again, and they start the thing  again, delivering oxygen to all the little fucking parts of your body.  There should be a split screen as you're saying this, and then the other half, it should  be, backtrack!  I have quite the ducotomy.  Punching, and fucking spitting, and biting a pillow.  This is what a man can be.  Goddamn, Jimmy has me down. 
[01:08:00]  But it's amazing to me that that's the same, it looks like fucking Ant and his brother Ant.  I just love how surprised you get when people have you down.  It's amazing to me that, this is great, but he didn't just, Ant just didn't kind of know  the answer.  He really knows how that works.  Yeah, he knows that shit.  You're not repeating what you've just heard, you really understand how that works.  Also, people are asking if the kid was circumcised, yes.  Ah, right away.  It's weird to see the little peener all fucking shaped into his penis.  Did they put him in that little plastic, like, monkey capsule seat? 
[01:08:30]  They don't know a lot, I don't think they'd let you watch that.  I don't think I could have watched that.  That's probably one of the only things I wouldn't be able to watch.  Did you apologize to him immediately?  Sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.  Dude, fuck.  I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.  It's for your own good, it's for cancer reasons, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.  You know what I learned?  Did I talk about how I was circumcised at three months on the show?  Three months?  The first day back, did I talk about that or not?  You mentioned it, yeah.  A little too late.  Well, you talk about circumcision and then, you know, I forgot how it came about. 
[01:09:00]  Somebody was talking to my mom and went, well, Greg was circumcised at three months.  Can you imagine being circumcised at three months old?  Why were you, though?  Like, what was the reason?  Why?  I found out that my dad wasn't circumcised.  Uh-oh.  What the fuck is that about?  I need to know more about that.  That's all you need to know, really.  He had a fucking, uh...  I need to know.  But he was...  Photo essay on this?  So he wasn't circumcised, which is weird, because he was a Catholic guy from Queens. 
[01:09:30]  Catholic guys from Queens got fucking circumcised, right?  Oh, they certainly did.  So I wasn't circumcised being the firstborn.  And then, I don't know, they somehow, through a doctor, said, you really need to circumcise  your kid or whatever.  So they did it when I was three months old.  At that point, you know, you're a little older and...  And could remember things.  Mm-hmm.  A little bit anyway, right?  That's scary.  I want to know why my dad wasn't circumcised.  That's fucking weird.  He was busy.  Was your dad circumcised? 
[01:10:00]  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  My father, yeah.  I think so.  I remember that.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Tom, are we done with you?  Hey, I got one more answer.  All right.  About the economy?  Yeah.  Straight tax, 15% across the board.  Whether you make a buck or a million bucks.  That's novel.  If what, buddy?  15% tax.  Okay.  For everybody.  Get rid of the IRS.  No deductions.  No nothing.  Everyone owes 15%.  Well, we need the IRS because they're going to enforce the health care, which is a great 
[01:10:30]  thing.  Well, I'm saying you don't.  Because they're so good at doing what they do.  Stop trying to be idea guy.  But I do agree with you.  Steve Forbes, I think, said 17%.  That was his idea, right?  17%.  And I'll be fine with that.  I chuckle at writing a 17% check.  Chuckle!  Flat tax.  Because again, if you make a fucking, you know, 10 million, you pay $1.7 million.  That's a lot of money to give the government.  And if you only make 200, you pay 34 bucks. 
[01:11:00]  Yeah.  That you should be able to keep $166 of your money.  Do your part.  But everyone should do their part.  That's...  Exactly.  All right.  Let's go to Vegas.  Vegas.  His name's Vegas.  Hey, what's up?  Morning, Jimmy.  Oh, I thought...  Hi, Vegas.  Hi, Vegas.  Hey, I have a question.  What happens to the other half the umbilical cord?  Does it snap back in or does it just dangle there?  Like the world's most disgusting tampon string.  Well, I know what happens.  I think, like, you know, a vacuum cleaner where you just, you know, the cord gets...  Oh, the cord?  Yeah, it goes flying back into it. 
[01:11:30]  Yeah, it goes flying back in there.  Like a fucking cartoon lampshade?  Yeah.  Or lampshade.  Fucking window shade.  I'm a dick.  I'm a half.  Isn't it actually connected to the placenta?  And then when the placenta comes out, it comes out with it?  No.  Women have to walk around with it dangling out of there forever.  And if they have, like, ten kids, there's just fucking...  Looks like wind chimes.  You ever see umbilical cord decorators?  They sell them?  Never did.  Oh, God.  Oh, really?  Wait, can I be completely honest? 
[01:12:00]  I never knew that.  I really thought it just kind of went back inside.  Oh, it's all connected to the placenta.  So you lose...  So the women loses all that?  Yeah, of course.  I didn't know that because you're supposed to count the knots and that is supposed to  tell you how many kids your body could have if you want.  Really?  Yeah.  Your body's capable of having five kids, let's say, if you see five knots.  Knots?  Oh, wives' tail.  Or whatever it is.  A little fucking...  Is it?  Those little, like, bubbly things?  Yeah, tumor-looking things.  Ew.  Throughout the thing.  God damn, that's fucking rude. 
[01:12:30]  Wait, so it doesn't go back in you?  No.  No, it all comes out.  Jimmy, did you know that?  I didn't know, but I wouldn't have thought it did.  I would have thought it just fell out.  I mean, I wouldn't have thought it just fell out.  I thought they just kind of tucked it back in and tucked it in.  Every time a woman sneezes, the umbilical flops in her panties.  Oh, imagine that?  You go down on some box and then...  Yeah, you look like Willem Dafoe eating the worm in Born on Fourth of July.  Remember that?  That's a good reference, topical.  Topical?  Great movie.  Did I say topical?  I think you said topical.  Did I say topical? 
[01:13:00]  I meant to say topical.  All right.  I don't say topical ever.  I could be wrong.  John in New York.  John.  Hey, guys.  Good morning.  Hi, John.  Good morning, John.  I was born with an anteater, and at the age of 15, a girl went down on me, and she's  like, what the fuck is that?  So I got embarrassed, and immediately the next day, I scheduled an appointment for a  circumcision, and let me tell you, getting a circumcision at the age of 15 is no picnic. 
[01:13:30]  It was killing me.  For you, maybe.  Is that possible?  Yes.  They do do it at 15?  I love the no picnic thing, though.  It's almost like a picnic is a fun thing with a blanket, and you have chicken.  Yeah.  And to say that, like, guys, contrary to popular belief, having the tip of your cock sliced  off does not equal that.  It exists, Danny.  Danny shows a small anteater.  That just looks like the fucking head was chopped off in a horrible industrial accident.  Yeah, yeah.  It looks like a snail.  Yeah.  It don't. 
[01:14:00]  So at 15, I would imagine that bleeds for a few weeks, huh?  Oh, yeah.  You have to wait for the citrus to fall off, and it looked like frankenpenis.  I was peeing blood for, like, a day.  Ah.  It wasn't the urine.  Urine didn't have blood in it.  It was just the outside area.  And you got to hope you don't get boners, because then you pop a stitch, and it starts  all over, right?  Oh, yeah.  No, no, no.  I couldn't look at any nudity magazines or any porn or anything, because if you got stimulated, 
[01:14:30]  forget it.  It would be so painful.  I was in bed for two days.  I couldn't move.  It was death.  All right.  Well, good for you.  Good for you.  Thank you, sir.  Angela is saying that Anthony is wrong.  Angela in Buffalo.  Yes.  I'm a registered nurse, and blood is never blue.  No, I know not blue.  It's just a very dark, dark red still.  People say blue, but it's not blue. 
[01:15:00]  I understand.  Because the blood that you get pulled out when they take tests, that's always red.  That's the same blood.  It's blood from veins.  Yeah, and it's just very dark.  It's not that bright, red, oxygenated blood.  I disagree.  Why is Sam here?  It's just how it's drawn in, like, fucking biology books.  It's blue.  All right.  And Sam is in here.  You're getting circumcised soon?  Well, I was listening to the caller, and I thought I'd share a story.  Cool.  Oh, you just decided that...  Look at the confidence in this kid. 
[01:15:30]  I know.  He just comes in here all cocksure.  He doesn't ask, like, hey, I might have a story that's good for the show.  He comes right in, puts the headphones on, and goes, all right, turn my fucking mic on.  Well, it relates.  Okay.  You have a circumcision story?  Yes.  Okay.  I was 19 years old when I was circumcised.  No.  No.  Dude, you started your internship at 20, I think.  Yeah.  That's a good story to hear.  Yes.  I was 19.  No.  I swear to God.  What happened?  Can we see it?  No. 
[01:16:00]  No, Danny.  You can't see it.  No.  It's perfectly fine and nice looking.  Why would you do that?  What happened?  Take us through this, Sam.  Well, I wasn't circumcised, obviously, when I was born.  My dad wasn't.  Why?  Because, oh, old school.  Yeah.  I mean...  Handlebar mustache.  Well, they were raised, you know, in the South.  I don't think anybody was.  Did he eat the cheese that built up under it?  Eat?  Well, I mean, you know, if you're not circumcised, I hear it could get a little cheesy down there.  Is that one of the world's greatest treats?  No.  Did he spread that on a nice cracker? 
[01:16:30]  Yep.  A little fucking...  Teak it with his buttermilk?  Oh, that's just certainly not.  So, wait, would you have to peel it back and clean it a lot?  Well, that's the thing.  I just...  Do you got a big one?  Well, that's not to be talked about.  It's fine.  It's not small.  It's not...  But being, like, part black, you would think you would have...  Hey, what are you packing?  Do you have a seven?  I mean, I don't know if I'm quite there.  It's average.  It's fine.  All right.  But, uh...  He's got a little one.  Yeah.  No, no, no, Sam.  Sam is skinny, and his chick is way too hot to tolerate a little bit. 
[01:17:00]  Because all he does is talk about wrestling.  What else is she liking him?  It's his cock.  What do you think?  She enjoys the fucking Hulk Hogan chats?  Did she have to go with you when you got your Bobby the Brain Heenan picture?  Yeah, she took the picture.  Oh, so Jimmy's right.  She goes to the conventions with me.  Jimmy's right.  You got a big piece.  Yeah.  Why else would she tolerate you?  Was she going out with you when you got circumcised?  No.  No.  Who were you going out with?  Were you going out with a girl?  Yeah, yeah.  Oh, and this is the reason you got circumcised?  No, it was because basically, for whatever reason, the hole in the foreskin, the urethra 
[01:17:30]  there, it wasn't big enough to stretch over.  So you couldn't get the head of your penis out of your foreskin?  Correct.  You basically bought a turtleneck that was too tight to put on.  That's correct.  Just his frizzy head sticking through and he's pulling.  So how much of your cock would come through the skin? 
[01:18:00]  Zero.  So when you got a boner, the foreskin stretched.  But the head never came out?  Never.  And the most pleasurable part is the head.  Something I learned later.  What do you mean?  You never?  No, no.  I mean, everything was fully functional.  Yeah, of course.  I had no problem doing anything.  But, it didn't, the head was never fully, there was, you know.  Did you try to, did you try to push it through every so often?  Well, once it became like, you know, something that was pointed out, like, is this not happening? 
[01:18:30]  Who pointed it out?  Well, I think the doctor did.  Oh, I thought you went to your mom and went.  Hey, what do you think of this?  My wee wee needs fixing.  I didn't know, but the doctor, probably when I was younger than that, had said something.  And then, my dad questioned me about it in an embarrassing discussion.  Oh, my God, I bet.  Three o'clock in the morning, he came in.  Sam, you awake.  All right. 
[01:19:00]  Let's see how this thing works.  And then, and so we went to the urologist to get, you know, a word on it.  Like, is this dangerous?  Is it whatever?  You know, I said, no, it's fine.  But hold on, how do you clean under the foreskin?  Oh, if you can't get your dick out.  That's a penile, it could be a penile cancer thing, too.  I think you have to clean properly.  Right.  Like, you have to point it up and actually get the water to get, to go in the hole.  So you couldn't do that?  Oh, my God.  What a hassle.  No, like, instead of peeling back, you have to actually get, you have to actually get, 
[01:19:30]  So how did you get, you couldn't actually just rub you under the skin around the head of your dick?  No, you couldn't get in at all.  So your fucking dick probably stunk.  I mean, it smelled fine to me.  Oh, bro.  Did you ever notice this when a girl's like, oh, let me suck your dick?  No, that situation never occurred.  Sam Snafu wants to know if your dad used his dick cheese for a mustache wax.  No.  He uses regular mustache wax.  Okay.  You know, I want to make sure.  Can we have a picture of that, Danny?  I want to see what that looks like.  What, Sam's dick? 
[01:20:00]  No, no, no, no.  I've never heard of that.  It is a, I can't remember the medical term for it.  Yes.  But it is when the foreskin doesn't stretch over the head or whatever.  Like, it doesn't, you can't peel it back.  Tight foreskin.  I knew you were going to go for that.  Yeah.  Oh, God.  Wait, wait, where is it?  Sam, what do you go?  That's you?  No, that's a little.  That's not a picture of me.  But that's what you had?  Yeah.  How do you explain that to people out there? 
[01:20:30]  It's like a, it's like the foreskin.  It's like a fucking mealworm.  It's like a, it's like an eyeball that's almost completely shut, right?  It looks like the end of a balloon with a penis inside.  Yes, that's correct.  Except you can't stretch the end of the balloon at all.  No, that thing is stretched to the limit.  So you couldn't, you couldn't even pop it out if you wanted.  No, no, no.  That's the whole thing.  It did not.  That is so bizarre.  Wow, that must have made sex real pleasurable, huh?  Well, I thought, I thought, I didn't know the difference. 
[01:21:00]  Uh-huh.  So what happened?  You just know what you know.  You know what you know.  Yeah.  I mean, it was a little, not so misshapen as that one, but.  It looks like a sea cucumber.  If you want a Google image of sea cucumber.  I think I got that right.  Oh, God.  You had a sea cucumber, dick.  Okay, so you fucking, look, there's the sea cucumber.  Yeah, that's it.  Yeah, that's one for my diving friends out there. 
[01:21:30]  Wow.  Sam has a sea cucumber, dick.  I mean, it's a flesh-colored sea cucumber.  Dr. Steve is saying it's called fumosis?  Yeah, that's it.  Yep.  Well, how about that drunk get on the line and fucking talk to us about it?  He's probably intoxicated.  Yeah, he probably is.  Bungling a surgery.  Exactly.  Just fumbling something right now.  Yeah, he's dropping a scalpel into an open wound.  Yeah.  So what happened?  The urologist said what?  Urologist said, you know, it happens.  It's not typical, but it happens. 
[01:22:00]  And as long as it's not causing you pain, it's not an emergency.  It doesn't, you don't.  Fuck you.  It's not that it's causing me pain.  It's not causing me the pleasure I can get when I'm fucking.  Did he say that?  No, he didn't.  He didn't say that.  He said, if you want to change it for aesthetics or for whatever reason, it's a simple procedure.  And you come in and you do it and you're out.  Okay.  And what made you say yes?  Well, because it wasn't.  Didn't you see the picture?  No, but I mean, yeah.  But if that's your day. 
[01:22:30]  Are you kidding me?  Yeah, that's true.  You've seen porn, so you knew it.  Yeah, I've seen porn.  I was like, you know, like going forward, I don't want to have to have an explanation.  Yeah.  Every time I said, if I just do this, I didn't tell a lot of people I was doing it, so I wouldn't have to explain anything.  Is that why you kiss guys?  That has nothing to do with anything.  Now, what is this like?  You go in.  Is it a local anesthesia?  Is it a...  Well, they knock you out.  No, they knock you out.  They knock you the fuck out.  Yeah.  Copafol?  I don't know what... 
[01:23:00]  No, it was actually because I don't ever do any drugs.  I never had and never...  This is it.  Faggot.  Exactly.  Yeah.  And so...  Too anicin and he fell asleep.  They put in the IV and said, this is just a cocktail.  This is just a sort of...  Cock.  That's what they call it.  That's what your dick looks like.  They said, this is just the starter.  It's like an appetizer and then we'll give you the real anesthetic.  But I didn't make it past that.  I was out.  Yeah.  And so then you wake up and it's just very bandaged up. 
[01:23:30]  How long of a procedure did they tell you?  Probably quick.  Yeah, it's not long.  I mean, I was up two or three hours later.  I was awakened.  And now, how did you piss and things?  Well, right after?  Yeah.  I mean, they leave the very tip exposed so you can piss.  So you have bandages?  Yeah, bandage and gauze.  Just the tip and stitches.  Like the invisible man.  Yes!  Oh God, that guy's a mess.  And I mean, and it kills. 
[01:24:00]  It hurts.  Sure.  You can't...  Well, it's your dick.  Yeah.  It's like...  I did it...  I was in college.  I was a freshman in college.  So I came home for spring break.  And I scheduled it to do it on the first day.  So it's funny.  What did you do?  Well, we were all in Fort Lauderdale.  How about you?  I had my tick, my...  Had your what, Jim?  I wanted to say cock tip, so I said tick.  Had your tick-tock tick.  Gads.  Aw, Jimmy.  So you...  How long did it take before it didn't hurt? 
[01:24:30]  Well, the stitches and bandages, you wait for them to come off on their own.  Like, they wash away.  Where are the stitches?  Where do they stitch?  Literally, like...  Right around?  Yeah, right around...  I mean, you can kind of see where it's done.  It's right...  It's just under the head.  It's just stitched.  Like, they fold back the skin and just stitch it.  Do they stitch babies, too?  I guess so.  Yeah, they must.  Oh, okay.  Um...  I had no...  No.  They have to.  I mean, how else would it stay?  I guess they do. 
[01:25:00]  I didn't...  I'm not studying my son's...  No, I don't see...  Take a look at it.  You should look at it.  I mean, just see it.  No.  Fucking...  I got peed on, but...  No.  But they'd be like...  I didn't know.  There's no stitches down there.  There would only be like one or two baby stitches.  You might not have seen them.  I don't think so.  Maybe baby skin melts.  I don't know.  Maybe they don't.  I don't know.  So what?  They put stitches...  We'll have to ask Dr. Steve.  In your case, they had to put stitches.  Yeah.  And then cover it up with gauze and everything.  And then...  Oh.  You just...  I mean, for a few days, you're just lying down the whole time. 
[01:25:30]  Oh, I don't know what's going on there.  A few days, you're just laying down.  So they...  Now, you have to...  When did you first take the gauze off to see the wound?  Well, I think it's like two days...  It's like two or three days you peel off the gauze.  And they said there's like a padding there that you, you know, have to take off too.  Uh-oh.  And I thought that I had to like...  There was like a little piece of padding there.  And it looked like kind of like a hard, like, gelatin almost. 
[01:26:00]  And so I start kind of trying to take it off.  And I was like, it's stuck.  And then I realized it was my swollen skin.  Oh, shit.  It was me.  It looks blistery, right?  Right.  It's very...  It gets very swollen.  Yeah.  But let me ask you, they cut around, like, let's say, what, an inch below the head or  whatever?  However low they go below the head?  Even a little less than an inch.  Yeah.  Like half an inch below the head, I'd say.  But do they have to...  The skin is supposed to peel back, so usually that's where they have to cut.  But because yours was fused to the top, do they have to cut the tibia dick too? 
[01:26:30]  Or no?  Just, I mean...  I don't know if it was fused.  It just...  No, it just wasn't big enough.  Yeah, it was kind of like what you guys were saying with the turtlenecks around where it's  connected.  It was 10 pounds of shit in a five-pound bag.  Dawn checking in on my text.  Yeah.  Of course, had a baby, you know, a couple of years ago.  Almost.  No stitches with baby circus.  Yeah, I don't think so.  So, how does that work?  I'm confused.  It just fucking heals up, I guess.  Let's go to Kevin in Michigan. 
[01:27:00]  He's a urologist that says, I could give some info on Sam's cock.  Okay.  Now, that's not how to talk there.  You don't sound very efficient.  Yeah, exactly.  Thank you.  That medical jargon he's using.  So, what's up, guys?  Hi.  Well.  You tell us, sir.  Yeah, I've been listening to your conversation.  The medical term is a fibrosis.  I think you already said that, but I was on hold.  And the last question I heard you guys ask was, well, when it was stuck to the head of  the penis, you have to cut to the head of the penis. 
[01:27:30]  The answer is no.  We don't.  Okay.  Because it's not stuck to the head, right?  Right.  It's not stuck to the head.  It's just the hole is too small to fit over the head.  Can't they just open the hole more?  Well, it depends.  Sometimes I've seen the skin actually grow into the head of the penis.  Jesus.  That wasn't me.  Like a fucking, like a stop sign growing into a tree.  Yeah, when the tree eats the stop sign.  Right.  Oh, my God.  Because it's like the foreskin is not attached to the head.  It just, it doesn't peel over it.  So, when you piss, the foreskin actually balloons before the piss comes out. 
[01:28:00]  Oh, God.  You have a little water balloon of piss.  Your dick must have stunk.  And then it just falls out like bleh.  Your dick must have smelled like pee.  Yeah.  I mean, I washed it.  I never.  Did you wash it good?  Did you wash it?  I had any complaints.  It was never brought up to me.  How would you wash it, though, like in a sink?  You'd have to be on your back in the shower.  Yeah.  I don't know.  It was never.  It looked like that.  No, that's a good size hole.  You can't wash it.  I mean, it needs what, when someone has what we call a trapped penis. 
[01:28:30]  That's what it was.  It was trapped.  Trapped penis.  Sam had a trapped penis.  It was.  That's hilarious.  Scared.  So what happened?  So we have a trapped penis, yes?  You need surgery.  So Sam got cut.  Then your dick was all swollen, right?  What did you have to put on your dick?  I'm sure you had to put on some kind of antiseptic, right?  Yeah.  I think they kept some kind of ointment on it.  And baths, you know, to make sure you had to soak it like every day or something. 
[01:29:00]  So you were taking baths.  And, you know, I was always wearing sweatpants for a week.  And, you know, walking with my legs separated so nothing was touching it.  How long did it, how long, uh, uh, did it, was it weird the first time you saw your cockhead?  Yeah.  And I mean, even.  Hi, how do you do?  That's kind of what Travis is asking.  He just says, you know how you get all excited when you get a new phone or a t-shirt?  I wonder what it's like to get a new penis.  A new cockhead.  Did you try to suck it?  What?  No.  Why would I?  I don't know.  Because it's a little better.  I mean, it's gradual. 
[01:29:30]  Because at first, it's like a fresh out of surgery penis.  Yeah.  And it's like, you can't even make out what it is.  But then once it starts.  That probably blew up to about four times the size of normal.  Right.  Wow.  And then once it starts kind of taking its own shape, you go, oh, yeah.  What about boners, Sam?  Well.  While it's healing.  Did you?  No, while it was, never.  How do you not pop a boner, though?  Just living your life.  I was worried about that, too.  But because you're just laying down and it hurts.  Right.  Your body just doesn't do it.  You know, sometimes we'll give, uh, a medication to someone to make it not get erect. 
[01:30:00]  Not get erect?  Oh, yeah.  They're there.  What are those pictures of some of our listeners?  But then, like, you would poke the head.  Oh, you would.  Why?  Just to touch it because it's never been exposed before.  Now, now.  Woo!  All right.  Let's fast forward.  You heal up.  Yes.  Your first sexual encounter with your new dick. 
[01:30:30]  What did you think about it?  I mean, it was, like, so much better.  He made cumsies really quick.  He made cumsies really quick.  So much easier.  Yeah.  I mean, it was like, what have I been missing out on?  This should have been done.  How long did it last?  Yeah, probably the tip of the head when he shot his load.  It's almost like.  Quick draw McGraw.  It's almost like, well, if the foreskin can't stretch over, like, if you can't peel it back,  it's like having a condom all the time.  You're wearing a condom made out of fucking thick skin.  Fuck that.  It's Travolta and the boy in the plastic bubble. 
[01:31:00]  Wow.  You must have been a rock star in bed before this.  Well, I guess.  I mean.  Well, Cheryl wants to know that, actually.  Except for Cheryl.  Your reeking penis.  Cheryl.  Yeah, it smells like fucking anal sex and piss.  Cheryl.  Hi.  How are you?  Good.  Cheryl.  You had the same surgery?  Yes.  I did not.  I did not.  But I had a question for, I wanted to know if he was able to last a lot longer in bed because  his sensation was decreased.  Well, yeah. 
[01:31:30]  I mean, my experience was very small at that point, being that I was 19, I hadn't been with  very many people.  People, not girls, by the way.  Girls.  Notice that slip up.  Come on.  I know.  Notice that slip up right there.  I'm trying to treat this like a medical discussion.  People.  I meant women.  I've never been with any men.  He can only dock with pencils.  That's true.  That's hilarious.  His little fucking foreskin hole.  You make me sick.  I know.  Well, it's not there anymore.  I got rid of it. 
[01:32:00]  I got rid of it.  I got rid of it.  I got rid of it.  I got rid of it.  I got rid of it.  Take your fucking tiny hole and hit the bricks.  Fucking rotten, ballooning dick.  That's what you have?  Yeah.  What?  That's the type of thing we're dealing with.  This is what...  It was that small?  It was small.  It was small.  But there's no...  See, this is even worse.  I mean, you got the regular fumosis.  I'm reading up on it.  This is something else.  It's even worse.  It's called pinhole.  Fimosis.  You had pinhole.  I mean, maybe it was slight...  It might have been slightly bigger than that.  It's exaggerating.  The skin is all the way over the head.  Yeah.  And the only hole is just enough for the pee hole. 
[01:32:30]  Exactly.  That's what it was.  Oh, my God.  Oh, so no wonder it blew up like a balloon.  Right.  And did you have any control of where it was going?  Yeah.  I mean, it's no control.  It looked like a half-finished sculpt...  Except you fucking shot a load.  That had to go all inside the fucking foreskin.  But after you're done, you got to squeeze...  Space food?  Yeah.  Space food?  It's like a thing of Go-Gurt.  Like, you got to squeeze it.  It probably is Go-Gurt.  You got to squeeze it.  You got to squeeze it.  Go-Gurt, Dick?  Yeah.  Does that probably look like a pastry chef when he was done?  Yeah.  Oh, yeah. 
[01:33:00]  Oh, you can write your name and jizz on a cake.  Wow.  Because even when you're pissing, instead of just shaking it, you have to pinch it a few  times and then shake and then pinch.  Pinch the helmet.  Pinch the helmet.  So, Cheryl wants to know, before and after, before the surgery, how long you last?  Well, I mean, I don't know.  How long?  It was Monday.  It was definitely...  You must have cut the time in half.  Yeah, probably.  For sure.  I mean, it's the difference between wearing a condom and not wearing a condom.  So, you went from two minutes to one minute?  I mean, I don't think you know how long... 
[01:33:30]  Well, if you're going to talk vague, I don't know.  Cheryl wants to know, right, Cheryl?  Right, absolutely.  But also, I was having my first experiences at the time, so those would have been quicker  as well.  Yeah, yeah.  Coming is a very mental thing, too.  Yes.  It's not just, you know...  It's not just...  It's not so...  Cheryl doesn't really know what she's talking about, let's be honest.  Depending on what you're doing, who you're with, things like that, your mood.  Right.  You could fucking come with a condom on quicker than you can bareback.  Precisely.  Yeah.  All right.  It's all relative, really.  That's a hell of a story, Sam. 
[01:34:00]  We've known you for a while.  You've never...  That is, wow, a little bit of honesty.  Honesty coming out.  Yeah.  No wonder you like wearing hoodies all the time.  Because your cock had one.  Yes.  No?  Because I'm scared.  I want to remain hidden.  Yeah, you want to...  And your father still has one of these?  I mean, I don't know.  You'd have to talk to him about it.  Does he have a small hole on his?  No, he's doing just fine.  How do you know?  He told me when I was younger.  Why did they wait until...  I mean, you were 19 when this was done, obviously.  Yeah, what the fuck?  Did they...  You could figure it out at 12, 13 when you're...  Well, not only that, but I mean, you know, they were changing diapers for how long? 
[01:34:30]  And never noticed if there was a problem there?  Well, no, you can't tell when you're young because everything...  You've got a small p-hole.  Yeah, but I'm saying if you've got a little p-hole, I mean...  Well, I would think that that's...  I've met Sam's mom, and she didn't want to think that her son wasn't perfect.  Would have a penis?  Wasn't perfect.  Yeah, she's trying to get it off altogether.  Sam's mom thinks Sam is perfect.  Well, she's right.  And so if she's looking at your fucked up dick, she didn't want to get on and said you might  not be perfect.  No, because it was brought up with the doctor, and even when I was old enough to go to the 
[01:35:00]  doctor myself, he said, it's not a necessity, do it if you want to.  And Sam, I also know your mom saves everything you've ever done.  Yes.  Including she has a Tupperware full of your hair.  Uh-oh.  The first time I grew my hair...  Did she save the skin?  No.  The foreskin is not...  Did she make a little pendant out of it?  The foreskin is...  Is she wearing your foreskin?  No, the foreskin.  A little heart-shaped pendant was disposed of.  In a little cameo.  She has saved everything.  She made a little fucking iPhone earbud. 
[01:35:30]  Sammy's foreskin.  A little Sammy's foreskin.  She can always hear her baby.  No.  What's the craziest thing your mom has saved from your childhood?  I know the hair is pretty...  That's up there.  Because that's when I first grew my hair long, and then I cut it short, and she had to save  the hair.  And she put all the hair in a Tupperware and put it in like a drawer.  Why?  I don't know.  She still has it, right?  She's obsessed with you.  I don't know.  Yeah.  What else?  That's why she coddled you with food.  Whatever little Sammy wants, Sammy gets.  Did she save your, like, I don't know, your clothes from when you were...  All those dumps.  ...and all that? 
[01:36:00]  Oh, yeah.  She saved every shit he ever took.  And she actually has a list of what caused it.  The weight in grams.  It's a little room called grams.  No one goes in here.  She adjusted the plumbing so Sam's fucking duties would fall in a bucket under the floor.  Yeah, Sam had to go duty in a little room.  And while Sam was sleeping, she went down and collected the duties.  Where is she keeping the duties?  There are no duties.  There's a duty freezer in the basement.  Is there a duty freezer in the basement?  I don't even have a basement. 
[01:36:30]  So there's that whole theory shot.  Oh.  All right.  So what did she say?  Yeah, what is the weirdest thing she said?  Well, like, we have garbage bags in our house that are full of dittos.  And it's all of, like, all of my work from third grade.  Is it a what?  Is it a giant bag?  Why not just put it in a box?  She's a hoarder.  Just in a giant garbage bag.  Your mom's a hoarder.  She's a Sam hoarder.  Yeah, a Sam hoarder.  Um, yeah.  Well, I mean, this isn't really safe, but just to give you part of her personality, I 
[01:37:00]  told a story on the Saturday Night Show, too, that when, like, in fifth grade.  Don't plug your show on.  I didn't even notice I didn't say the name of the show, so it wasn't really a plug.  Same with Dave.  Thank you, Hopi.  Jesus.  It helps us.  It's our fucking channel.  Promote the fucking show.  Special delivery.  9 p.m. Saturday.  There you go.  Um, on, like, when the school would have a barbecue, uh, for student council or whatever.  It was, like, fifth grade, and they made burgers and hot dogs, and my mom was very active in 
[01:37:30]  the community and very active in the school, so she would come and be the chaperone.  Were you able to see the end of the hot dogs, or did they have to see the end of the hot dogs?  No?  The hot dogs you could see the end of.  Oh, okay.  Sorry.  But I didn't eat hot dogs or burgers, and on more than one occasion, I can remember my  mom grabbing her purse and pulling out a raw chicken breast in a plastic bag to put on  the grill.  So she got involved in this thing due to her son obsession, and she would actually just  bring special things to cook for him. 
[01:38:00]  Right.  You're very overrated in your own house.  Yes.  Yeah, you're, uh, are you as much a mama's boy as she is, uh, uh, you know, doting on you?  I don't think so.  Yeah.  I bet you are.  No, because I try, I mean, I don't call, I don't see her every day.  You're like Norman Bates.  No, I'm not.  You're fucking sick, man.  You really is.  I, oh man.  A foreskin sitting in a chair, rotting foreskin with a wig on it. 
[01:38:30]  Mark B. in Connecticut wants to know if she still has breast milk in the back of the  freezer.  I don't think there's any.  Did she save, did she save her breast milk?  I don't think there's any breast milk left.  No.  And the foreskin was disposed of.  It was not.  Medically.  Of course.  It was not.  It did not leave the hospital.  It's framed.  It's somewhere.  I know it.  Tom Ladd is suggesting it might be a pinky ring right now.  No.  It's not.  Oh, that's true.  No.  No.  Real tight pinky ring.  Yeah, it would be a snug fit.  Fucking awful. 
[01:39:00]  That is a crazy story.  She would actually show up with chicken in her purse.  Yes.  I hope she said that in therapy.  And I just, I couldn't let him out of my sight.  I had to go to every event and I carried raw meat in my purse.  Yes.  Sometimes life-shavers would get stuck to it.  Yeah, raw meat she had in her purse.  Correct.  Chicken.  E. coli.  It was in a plastic bag.  It doesn't matter.  I Ziploc.  I was, I was.  So they leak on her lipstick.  She puts that on, gets E. coli.  I hope she's okay.  I was, I was privy to be invited to Sam's last birthday party. 
[01:39:30]  Oh my God.  And they should be called birthday parties.  Was it just like a fucking five-year-old party?  I felt like I was at a five-year-old birthday party.  It was a celebration for a birthday.  Why don't you explain to Anthony where we all had to eat chicken fingers because that's  his favorite meal.  Aw.  Of course.  Who's going to have, who's going to pick the food at their birthday?  But everyone was looking at, at me like, I know this is weird, but this is what we  do every year for Sam.  No, no, it was your imagination.  To pin the tail on a donkey and everybody has to pull foreskins over there.  So they can't see, get it?  Yeah, you fucking, you live a worse penis. 
[01:40:00]  And they would stir him aside.  What, what was served for your birthday party?  Uh, well, chicken fingers.  Yep.  Uh, and your dad, who's like old school, like, I could tell his dad is a meat eater.  He wants a good, solid fucking steak.  And a nice baked potato.  What did he have to eat?  He likes the sesame chicken too.  Sesame chicken fingers.  I like sesame chicken.  Sesame chicken fingers.  Fingers is the, is the, uh, the key word.  Yeah.  Well, it's with the homemade.  Not sesame chicken.  It's a homemade breading.  She makes breadcrumbs and all this stuff put together. 
[01:40:30]  Yep.  She makes you chicken fingers?  Yeah, from scratch.  Yes.  I didn't think anyone did this.  I thought you just bought them.  No, she makes the, the breading for it.  Like, she takes old bread and makes breadcrumbs.  She is so just enamored with you in a very unhealthy, motherly way.  She loves.  I'll bet you when you're not home, I'll bet you she walks around with her iPod on just  singing, Sam, Sam, Sam, Sam, Sam, Sam, Sam, Sam, Sam, to whatever song is on.  But why couldn't we eat other things?  That's disturbing. 
[01:41:00]  She just thinks about you all the time.  Why couldn't we eat other things?  Why did we all have to eat chicken fingers?  There was a chocolate cake with vanilla frosting.  Do you like that?  I do.  What else was served with the chicken fingers?  I forgot.  There was no adult food on the table.  There was, there was a vegetable plate, but it was like the small carrots and stuff.  It was icky and gross.  No.  I ate baby carrots and cherry tomatoes.  Mother, I don't want this.  Take it away, dear.  Did you hear what he just said?  He does eat vegetables, but they're baby carrots and, and, and cherry tomatoes. 
[01:41:30]  Yeah, just something pop in your mouth.  He doesn't like eating like a, a, a normal sized tomato or a normal sized carrot.  Sam's a big carrot.  Sam's mom likes him to be baby boy Sam.  So that's one reason he was continually given all baby boy foods.  Yeah.  Because this way she doesn't feel older if baby boy Sam is not getting older.  Right.  Baby boy Sam.  She wants to.  Don't fuck with his little wee wee.  Yeah, she wants to make, yeah, she wants to make Sam his little baby boy food and always  be Sam's mommy.  We had a drink out of sippy cups, which was really strange for all of us.  There was no, Opie's exaggerating now.  That's awkward.  Oh, okay.  Little birthday cups. 
[01:42:00]  Little balloons on them.  There were, there were little popper mowers for his, for a present.  That's incorrect.  And then we all had to sit around and watch Sam open the gifts like he was five years old.  Did they have party hats?  No, there were no party hats.  It was wrestling toys.  Well, I'm a collector.  A collector.  You collect piss under your foreskin.  You filthy dick.  I used to.  Hey, Allie dick.  Look at his dick smells like a foot.  And then every, every, every webbing.  Every time a gift was open and the, the wrapping paper fell to the floor, Sam's mom ran and 
[01:42:30]  grabbed it and ran into another room.  I don't know what that's about.  She sounds like a nice woman, but she's alone.  But I think she was, I think she was collecting the, uh, the wrapping paper.  She's a cook.  His mom's a cook.  Is it true she collects the wrapping paper?  No, she would have, I'm sure, thrown it out.  But she's a lovely woman and I'm sure she appreciates all three of her children equally.  Nah.  You don't think so?  Nah.  You don't either?  I saw it for myself.  Okay.  Are you the youngest?  No.  I'm the middle.  Well, that's very rare.  I think you're, I think your siblings are, uh, are pretty much fed up with you, Sam. 
[01:43:00]  You think so?  Oh, yeah, they are.  You know what it is?  She's, like, another year we gotta eat fucking chicken fingers.  She's nicer to him than the white ones.  That's the problem.  She has a weird guilt with Sam because she knows somebody snuck in.  Is that it?  Do your siblings have any other weird, like, food things?  Um, yeah.  My sister decided she was lactose intolerant at an older age, which is obviously nonsense.  I don't think you'd decide that.  Well, she, I mean...  Who's Bobby?  Huh?  Who's Bobby? 
[01:43:30]  What do you mean, who's Bobby?  I got this.  The champ?  It says, for the other kids' birthdays, Bobby still makes Sam a special cake.  This is anonymous.  I'm...  Okay.  I wasn't supposed to read that part.  That's the mom, I guess, B-O-B-B-I, and I'm gonna guess that...  Who's Bobby?  B-O-B-B-I-E is Roberta Roberts.  That must be the father texting.  Wait, who's Bobby?  My mom.  So, for the other kids' birthdays, that means your brother and your sister.  I don't get a special cake.  That's what this person's saying, Bobby still makes...  Boom, I make him a cake.  Boom, I ice him, I put it on... 
[01:44:00]  Yeah, you know what?  My kid, his dick, his neck doesn't come through the hole.  Boom, he wakes up, he's got his paper, his penis is filled with urine.  Well, people very close to you are throwing you under the bus.  So, wait a minute.  So, your brother has a birthday.  Yeah.  Bobby, your mom.  Yeah.  Now, bakes the nice cake for your brother, right?  Yeah.  But bakes a special cake for you, because you're not gonna eat your brother's cake.  That's inaccurate.  That's what this person is saying.  Two cakes on a birthday just so you could eat cake.  Inaccurate.  Cupcakes is coming in.  Cupcakes.  Okay, this is what I'm about to say. 
[01:44:30]  Cupcakes!  It's inaccurate to make that statement about a birthday.  It doesn't happen on birthdays.  But for an occasion, like a Thanksgiving or a Christmas, where a pie is more traditional,  some of us prefer not to eat a pie.  Not some.  You want cake.  One person in the house.  Everyone else is eating pie and you have to have a cupcake.  There'll be pies made and then there'll be a batch of chocolate cupcakes with vanilla frosting.  For you.  I don't mind a batch of cupcakes.  Yes.  No, but it's for him. 
[01:45:00]  How about this?  Like, he can't even, like, have a piece of pie with the grown-ups.  But I don't make a big deal about things.  I'll just say I prefer not to have pie.  Thank you anyway.  This is what should have happened.  I'm gonna be Sam's mom and I want Sam to be Sam.  Okay.  Sam, let's just say it's the holiday.  I want you to say, I'd like cupcakes because I prefer them.  I'd like some cupcakes, some chocolate with vanilla frosting.  That's what I prefer.  Have pie like everyone else, cunt.  Oh.  Yes.  That and everything.  Why wouldn't she, have you ever been reprimanded by your mom? 
[01:45:30]  Yeah, I've been reprimanded by my mom.  And what would you say was the strictest thing she's ever done to you in your whole life that  you remember as being like, wow, mom was pissed and she did this to me.  Like, either a beating or what.  She was not the disciplinarian of the household for sure.  Of course she wasn't.  But for times when I would have a smart mouth or something, when I'd be talking back.  She'd put her vagina in it.  Okay, now that's disgusting.  Wow.  That's awful.  Wow. 
[01:46:00]  She's probably listening.  Wow.  She probably heard you say that and she will be offended.  I want to apologize to Bobby.  Please do.  I apologize to Bobby.  Please do.  I'm sorry for...  Please do.  That's very...  Anthony's inappropriateness.  Yeah.  It's on call for.  That is terrible.  I do apologize.  Okay.  So your dad disciplined you.  He would put you over his handlebar mustache knee.  No.  There's no mustache.  My mom would at times open hand smack me in the mouth. 
[01:46:30]  Wow.  That's kind of...  It would just put it like that.  But that's really kind of violent.  Right.  That was probably traumatic for her to have to go there.  Or during road trips, she would always, when we were arguing with each other in the backseat,  smack the thigh of whoever was nearest as hard as she could.  Because she's in the front seat.  So she'd turn around.  She'd reach back.  And smack you.  Smack.  And then she'd fucking watch that little pinworm wiggle in your shorts.  This person continues to throw you under the bus, Sam. 
[01:47:00]  Great.  He hates pie.  That's true.  He's a freak.  Okay.  And Bobby does his laundry.  Well, that's true.  But this is not like she's always...  Right now, right now I'm 26 years old.  I'll be 26.  Mom's doing your laundry?  This is what's happening here.  In college...  But you don't live at home, by the way.  If you lived at home, I would see where, okay, mom's doing laundry.  What the fuck?  I'll do your laundry.  In college, I did my own laundry.  I was away from home.  Then I moved to an apartment that had a washing machine in it. 
[01:47:30]  I did my own laundry there.  We moved to this new apartment where the only laundry machine you have to pay for.  Yeah.  And we end up going to my parents' house maybe once every week or two for dinner.  And my mom says, why don't you bring your laundry over here?  You don't have to pay for the machines.  And you used to then say, no, mom, it's okay.  I'm a responsible adult.  I can do the laundry.  You really got to let me go and live my life. 
[01:48:00]  See, that's what the person messaging you would like me to say if I think I know who's messaging you.  And there have been arguments to that effect.  But...  Oh!  I think I have to cut your umbilical cord.  Yeah, yeah.  Cut the umbilical cord.  I didn't even get to work with that thing still attached to you.  I'll bet you while she's folding his clothes, she's just saying, I'm folding Sammy's shirt.  I'm folding Sammy's underpants.  It's probably just a musical in that house.  My mom says she does not mind.  In fact, somewhat enjoys doing laundry. 
[01:48:30]  So, it's a non-issue for her.  And I'd rather budget the money to a better cause.  Your skid-marked underwear.  There's no...  Your mom is saying...  Does she do Jess's stuff, too?  Or does she...  No, no.  Of course not.  Oh, my God.  Make the whore do it herself.  No, no, no, no, no.  But that's not...  That's not...  I'm not washing her dirty underpants.  Yes.  Why doesn't she do your girlfriend's laundry?  She's offered, but Jess has been like, I mean...  Now it doesn't make sense.  Jess has said, I appreciate the offer, but I would...  Now it's off.  Now it doesn't make sense.  I would prefer to do the laundry myself. 
[01:49:00]  So, how does Jess do it?  So, at that point, shouldn't you say, I also prefer to do my own laundry?  No, because Jess pays for the machines downstairs.  I don't want to pay for machines.  Why doesn't Jess just do yours?  Yeah.  Because then, I mean, we'd still have to do multiple loads.  So what?  It's just a matter of paying for the machines.  I don't want to pay for it.  Not that much.  Yeah.  Pay for the machines.  Once a week, stop.  How much more would it be for you to do your laundry with Jess's laundry?  Once a week.  It could be upwards of...  Seven dollars?  Not...  I mean, maybe over two weeks.  Seven dollars.  Are you a cheapskate?  That's not a cheapskate. 
[01:49:30]  No, they don't pay them, man.  You depend...  That's not being that cheap.  You depend on your mommy.  They don't pay them.  No, because...  You have a grave dependence on your mommy.  You want to be a little boy.  No, because if she said, I'm not going to do your laundry anymore, I'd be like, that's  fine.  I wouldn't hold a grudge.  I would just do it myself and pay the mommy.  She's enabling.  She is enabling.  It's not...  I got another message here.  Oh, good.  I was just hoping you would.  She's not, and not is in capital letters, my servant.  Right.  That would...  See, that kind of gave away who your anonymous texter would be, Jess feels more comfortable 
[01:50:00]  doing her own laundry, as if to say, look, I appreciate you offering to do my laundry,  Sam's mom, but I don't want to...  You're not my...  Like, I feel like...  I feel uncomfortable having you do things for me.  You're not my servant.  But by saying that, she's, in essence, saying that she is your servant.  She thinks that I'm taking advantage.  Yeah.  You are.  She does think I'm taking a bit of advantage.  You know what?  But it gives mommy something, too, because she loves her little Sam. 
[01:50:30]  Mom wants to do it, too.  You know what?  I would fucking take advantage of that.  Fuck yeah.  No way.  You don't have to do your own laundry.  You get it done for free.  I'm perfectly capable of doing my own laundry and have done it in the past.  If you have a girlfriend, I would agree with that, but you have a chick who's doing  it, she's already going down with her clothes, so it's not like you've got to drive.  It's in the building, right?  It's in the building.  See?  All right.  This is...  So instead, you load your fucking laundry up in your vehicle.  Waste gas.  Drive to your mommy's. 
[01:51:00]  No, not waste gas, because I will go when I was going anyway.  So if we're going over for dinner...  Which is pretty much every day.  I'll bring some laundry.  Not every day.  When does she do the laundry?  While you're there?  No.  So then I'll come pick it up next time I'm over.  Oh, my God.  Is there ever an instance where...  That means you're over your mom's a lot, because who could go that long without new  clothes?  Right.  Or clean clothes?  No, I could go a week.  Sam, does this ever happen?  Like, you got your laundry, but mistakenly, like, one pair of panties might get in there  of Jess's, and then your mom just... 
[01:51:30]  You hear her scream, Sam!  No, I'm sure...  And she holds them up, looking at them angrily.  Maybe she sewed his foreskin clothes so he wouldn't ever have sex.  There was nothing...  Did the doctor ever check that out?  Again.  Maybe it was normal, and she delicately stitched it shut so you couldn't have sex?  This conversation has taken a turn for the worse.  There was nothing medically...  Pretty accurate.  ...wrong with the foreskin.  It was just something aesthetically that I chose to do.  No, we saw pictures. 
[01:52:00]  That's, that's...  We saw pictures.  There was definitely something wrong with it to you.  It's a maggot.  You had a maggot cock.  You had a sea cucumber, man.  I understand that...  Like, you couldn't pull it down...  I couldn't pull it down over your head, so that's definitely a problem.  But the doctor that I spoke to said it was okay for the time being.  There may have been an issue in the future.  I don't know.  The time being, you're fucking...  They're giving you a 19.  Exactly.  How much more time being?  Exactly.  So maybe it would have been fine, but I chose...  For 19 years, you were blowing up your cock like a piss balloon. 
[01:52:30]  Correct.  But there was nothing wrong with it.  No, there is something wrong with that.  Exactly.  There's something wrong with it.  That's not normal.  No, there...  Yes, Sam, come on.  I appreciate all your judgments.  Your dick looked like Belushi in a food fight.  I appreciate all your judgments, but I'll take the word of the urologist.  Try to guess what I am now.  Sam's dick.  Get it?  I get it.  Yeah.  Wow.  Animal house.  Circumcision at 19 years old.  Yeah, and then after a week...  And mommy issues.  Wow, there's no mommy issues.  No, there are huge mommy issues. 
[01:53:00]  You think so?  Either...  Nah.  I don't know how big the mommy issue is with you, but there's a huge son issue with mommy.  It's big, both of us.  Thank you for saying that, because I actually saw the relationship.  Sam would do what any guy in this room would do, take advantage of that.  You're taking advantage of your mom's kindness.  Why not?  Who the fuck wants to do their own laundry?  But your mom loves this kid more than the other two kids.  We could have dinner over at the house multiple times per week.  Easily.  Never do.  Does she smell your underwear and then suggest vitamins? 
[01:53:30]  No.  That you can use?  She doesn't do that.  I'm not smelling enough vitamin B12.  Does she ask to see your stool?  No.  She's never asked to see my stool.  She looks at your stools?  I just said no.  A stool sample?  You have to listen to the response, not just the question.  I heard what Danny said.  I know, but then I responded by saying it's incorrect.  How does she do that?  She just pokes around?  She runs in and she checks.  That's fabrication.  For color and odor.  Yeah, I think your duties are collecting somewhere.  No. 
[01:54:00]  My fecal matter is disclosed of in my apartment.  I think she puts some kind of trap in where they don't actually flush all the way to where they go.  She pulls a lever and like a train, it switches tracks and goes to a special place.  Like Indiana Jones?  Yeah.  It's a log flume.  I bet you she doesn't want Sam to dress older too.  Like if it's an event, he puts his suit on and she probably says, oh, don't be such a fuddy-duddy.  Makes him take his suit off.  Do you still wear onesies in front of your mom?  No, that's a ridiculous premise. 
[01:54:30]  Does she buy you Oshkosh Bagosh?  No.  She buys me proper clothing when she buys me clothing.  But for the most part, I buy my own clothing.  She still doesn't burp you, right?  What a big boy.  No, of course not.  That's silly.  I'm 26 years old.  All right, just trying to figure this whole thing out.  Ridiculous.  He wears little kids under his grass holes.  Are you mad when guests come over when she cooks your dinner because you can't use a baa-ba?  Baa-ba.  No, I don't use a baa-ba. 
[01:55:00]  You have a little nook.  That's something a small baby would use.  I drink milk out of a glass.  Yeah, but you still drink milk.  I prefer milk with dinner.  Do you pick it up with two hands?  I have milk every once in a while.  Do you pick the glass up with two hands and you can barely?  No, I just drink with one hand.  Mommy helps you?  A glass of milk every night.  Does she feed you with a spoon and then scrape the food off of your bottom lip and give  it back to you?  Every night I feed myself.  You like cold milk?  Cold?  You like it cold, yeah.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  So you have a giant milk with dinner.  I mean, a regular size.  Okay.  Yeah. 
[01:55:30]  So do you like chocolate milk?  Yeah, I mean, who doesn't like chocolate milk?  Of course he does.  He's black.  Strawberry?  I prefer chocolate.  Yeah, right.  He is black.  Yeah, he fucking loves Funyuns.  I do like Funyuns.  And grape soda.  What does your bib look like?  Does it have, like, I love mommy on it?  You mean from the time I was a child, what did it look like?  No, the one that you might be wearing when you go to dinner.  Right.  I don't wear a bib when I eat these days.  Mommy puts on you.  You know, we're leaving your dad alone.  Thank you for that.  Does your dad roll his eyes like, what the fuck is this all about? 
[01:56:00]  No, my dad.  Because he loves you, too.  I see it.  I see the love in this fucking family.  It drives me nuts because I didn't have the same type of upbringing as Sam.  But does your dad go enough already, ever?  I picture him just holding his hands over each ear really tight in a big chair when any  of this is happening between you and your mom and just going, no, no, no, no, no.  Like, really just angry at the situation?  He's not angry.  I mean, a lot of the situations you've described have been exaggerated. 
[01:56:30]  Yeah?  Yeah.  So he's not angry at these situations because he sees that it's just normal interactions.  It's not normal.  I think he's just disgusted.  He's probably saddened by his wife's dependency on her son and disgusted with his son's predator-like  advantage-taking.  Tonight is a dinner at the parents' house, so I will find out.  She doesn't swap out the milk for breast milk or anything.  Well, I've told you.  You brought up breast milk twice now, and I've told you that there is no more breast milk to  be had.  You know what breast milk tastes like? 
[01:57:00]  Yes.  I tasted breast milk ice cream.  Hey, so did I.  Hey.  That was nice.  Wow.  All right.  But yeah, like a week.  That was so rude.  I had a joke before.  It was so rude.  Oh, yeah.  I mean, I apologize to Bobby.  Thank you.  Bobby's a very nice lady.  She seems very nice.  She doesn't have any major issues either.  No, no.  She's the wife in Natural Born Killers.  Okay.  When Rodney's wife.  Rodney's wife.  Wow.  Sort of. 
[01:57:30]  No, not sort of.  My father is not abusive.  I'm not saying your father's abusive, but the mom.  Rodney Dangerfield.  I think your mom wants to mother me a little bit.  Why do you think that?  You only been over the house one time.  I got the feeling, though.  She kind of had a thing for me.  Not in that, you know.  Uh-oh.  What?  More of like a mother-son way.  Really?  Yeah.  Well, I mean.  Well, you're the same age.  No.  Sam's parents had their kids old, too, like me.  Well, I mean.  Is she just older?  Older.  Is she a nurturing woman?  She's very nurturing.  She likes to nurture people. 
[01:58:00]  Yes.  And help out.  And she takes very good care of Jess.  She's happy all the time.  She's a very happy lady.  Like all the time.  It's amazing.  And she takes very good care of my brother and sister, as well.  Yeah?  Oh, yes.  But they've had it.  Putting the fucking floor cleaner in their soup when they're sick.  Exactly.  That's why they try to do a puppet show.  Stupid puppet show.  I want a little puppet show.  And the mother brings the cleaner in and dumps it in.  That puppet show stunk. 
[01:58:30]  She deserved to be poisoned.  Oh, didn't she?  She had a whole life of failed puppet shows coming up.  A kid in six cents would have amounted to nothing.  I knew this was coming in.  Lydia.  Oh, great.  Oh, wow.  Good.  I'm glad.  Lydia.  Good morning, boys.  Congratulations, Opie.  I cannot believe that the three of you have become the judge of what's a normal mother.  Yeah, thank you very much, Lydia.  You're right.  I've already said that.  It's a very different mother thing than what I'm used to. 
[01:59:00]  And sure, there's probably a little jealousy.  It sounds to me like everybody in this room.  I remember once I was late for curfew by five minutes and my mom said, bake your own fucking birthday cake.  Okay, that's a little harsh.  Wow.  I remember one time I dropped the cement on my mother's finger and she went, you fuck.  Yeah, that's right.  I love that one.  You fuck.  Because just the thought of your sweet mom who loves her Jimmy saying something like that is hysterical. 
[01:59:30]  You know what?  Jimmy's mom, very sweet, too.  She must have been sweet, man.  And I witnessed Jimmy's mom bringing fucking birthday gifts.  No, Christmas gifts.  What, four months too late?  Yeah.  Three months too late?  Three months too late to the Borgata.  To the Borgata.  Yeah, brought the birthday gifts all wrapped.  Right.  I mean, the Christmas gifts.  So.  There's a sweetness with Jimmy's mom, too.  And with Ann's mom, for that matter. 
[02:00:00]  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  My mom is great when I was growing up.  I didn't have issues.  My mom's sweet in her own way.  She's got her good qualities.  You had no issues growing up, Anthony.  It was all your dad, not your mom at all.  Oh, you think so?  How the fuck do you do?  You think so?  Yeah, what, did we sit down and fucking hash this out?  Right.  Shut it.  Go get implants to fucking get your self-esteem up, you drunk.  I'm just saying you shouldn't hate on Sam.  Thank you very much, Lydia.  I'm not hating on Sam.  I'm just saying that his mother's a little too doting on a boy of his age. 
[02:00:30]  For the show, would you breastfeed off Lydia's big boobies?  No, actually, I don't think I would.  And stop using lingo like you're fucking one of Snoop Dog's posse.  Don't hate on him.  I don't want my therapist talking like fucking Snoop.  Don't hate on me, bitch.  Boo.  Okay, guys, punching you out.  You didn't even add anything.  She thinks that I'm completely normal.  You think Sam is normal with the mom? 
[02:01:00]  I think that it's pretty typical, yeah.  Thank you very much, Lydia.  I think you're right.  Not a 26, 27.  Lydia's a medical professional.  I am indeed.  Yes, Lydia knows.  She's gone to school for this.  She knows.  Yeah.  Yep.  I want to pee in your mouth.  Why?  Lydia's.  Oh.  You want to pee in my mouth?  Is that what you're saying?  Why not?  Piss all over those big tits.  Yeah.  Hey, piss tits. 
[02:01:30]  How are you?  That would be great.  You know, I'm not even into like fucking water sports like that, but just have Lydia laying  down with our giant, ample fucking implants and then just a real long, like you just drank  water all day, you held it in.  Were you going to lean against the wall to brace yourself?  You're just exhausted from standing there pissing so long and just have you soaked in  piss.  That sounds really sexy, Anthony.  Doesn't it?  I think it does.  Oh, yeah.  I'd aim for your nipples so it would kind of spread the stream out and splash in your 
[02:02:00]  face.  How great would that be?  I'll come over to the compound.  We could do it live.  Wouldn't that be good?  Then I'll choke you.  Boy, it sounds to me like somebody's got some issues.  Great.  Okay.  Just trying to stick up for Sam a little.  Sorry.  Thank you.  All right, Lydia.  Stick up for Sam.  I think Sam still needs sticking up for him.  He's got a mother that does everything for him.  That's incorrect.  That's inaccurate.  Can we take a break now?  Sam's a girly boy.  No, not true.  He's just taking advantage of his own mom. 
[02:02:30]  That's not true either.  We all have a very healthy relationship.  No, you don't.  He still eats the baby food.  Sam's a girly boy.  The baby food.  What is your favorite baby food?  I hear they're pretty good.  I don't eat baby foods.  You do?  Does she blend up your food?  No.  Why would she blend up?  Does she cut your chicken into small pieces so you don't  choke?  I cut my own food and feed myself.  But she initially cuts it up into finger strips.  Well, I mean, I prefer it.  And breads them.  I prefer chicken fingers.  Why wouldn't she just do it with a whole chicken, right? 
[02:03:00]  Get this.  Like a chicken breast.  Like a cutlet?  Or a cutlet.  And then just bread it with the breading stuff instead of  making little bite-sized fingers so that little Sammy can  use a fork and a knife.  Or would you hurt yourself?  No, I wouldn't.  I've used forks and knives before.  Yeah?  But, I mean, I like a chicken finger.  Everybody likes chicken fingers.  No.  No?  No.  Sometimes.  Yeah.  I don't go out of my way to order it, though, if it's around.  How about mac and cheese?  No, I don't eat pastas.  What the fuck is wrong with you? 
[02:03:30]  You don't eat any.  That isn't like a pasta.  That's mac and cheese.  No, it's a pasta.  It's not like marinara sauce.  Just because he was babied.  If his mother had said, you're eating this, shut up.  He would have eaten it.  You really don't eat mac and cheese?  No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.  No, no, no, no.  And he's saying it like, no, no, no, no, no, no.  I'm not gay.  Listen to him.  Dude, it's the greatest comfort food of all time.  I don't eat any pasta, noodles, anything like that.  Noodles?  No egg noodles?  No, nothing.  What about like soup with noodles in it?  No, because I don't eat soup either.  You don't eat soup at all?  I don't eat soup or noodles.  What the fuck? 
[02:04:00]  How do you not eat soup?  I don't like soup.  Don't you like a good like clam chowder?  No, no.  That looks disgusting.  I'm not a fan of soups.  Pasta, though.  What the fuck?  Or you want a nice red sauce?  You want a thing shaped like his awful dick.  Chicken fingers and fish sticks.  I don't like the texture of pasta.  Yeah, you got a texture problem.  Wow.  And you don't eat steak.  No, no.  No, yeah, the only really...  Pasta?  No, no meat, really.  Except chicken. 
[02:04:30]  And then no vegetables except little pieces of fucking baby carrots.  Well, I mean, I don't have some lettuce here and there and stuff.  Doesn't that look delicious?  It doesn't look delicious.  There's nothing better than a chicken soup with a big wide egg noodle in it and some carrots.  Nice chickeny broth.  Mmm, mmm, mmm.  No, because I like vegetables raw, so there's nothing in there that's appetizing.  How about, uh, do you like, uh, fuck, I forgot what I was going to...  Not chicken, you don't eat fish sticks.  Mashed potatoes.  No, well, I mean, no, not really.  I've tried them.  Oh, my God. 
[02:05:00]  Mashed potatoes?  Your menu is very limited.  I eat raw potatoes.  Ugh.  You know, starchy.  Wait, actually raw?  Yeah.  That's what your dad eats, too, right?  Yeah, you just...  Is that part of his greatest treats of all time?  Yeah, you just...  But those are good.  You just peel them, wash them, put some salt on it, and slice it up.  Fuck that.  It's crunchy.  It's good.  Yeah, raw potato wouldn't be good, then.  Raw potato's good.  You ever have a baked potato?  If you're starving...  Bagel bites are good.  Do you eat pizza?  Bagel bites are good.  Bagel bites are pretty good.  Pizza?  Pizza I love.  Yay.  You really are a child. 
[02:05:30]  I mean, no.  I'm a well-developed 26-year-old man.  Do you think you'll ever grow into big boy food?  No.  No.  Like, to be able to go...  When you go out with Jess...  Yeah.  ...your lovely, lovely girl Jess, and you go to a nice restaurant, do you ever take her  out to a nice restaurant?  Well, there was an issue.  We went to a nice restaurant with Jess and my family for my sister's birthday, and I guess  she was turning 30. 
[02:06:00]  And so, it was like a really nice restaurant, and they don't even have a menu.  It's a five-course meal.  Oh, wow.  And they bring you the courses.  Oh, boy.  But I was like...  Someone tells me one of those courses wasn't chicken fingers.  Right.  I told my parents before we went, I was like, you know, it's not a big deal, but, you know,  I'm not going to eat a whole lot here.  Sam has also got, like, as a middle child, there's an attention thing with that, too, that  probably started very young.  Yep.  A way of getting extra attention and special treatment.  Because at the time, he was the youngest one. 
[02:06:30]  He didn't feel like the middle.  Yeah.  There's something else with that.  It's not just textures.  It's probably also why I do this for a living.  Attention.  Nah, yeah, I understand.  Don't drag us into your circle of fucking motherly need.  Exactly.  Don't that make it look like we're all in the same boat, guys.  Yeah.  We're not.  We all have our own problems.  Oh, of course.  Yeah, yeah.  This one's yours.  Oh.  No Bones wants to know if you eat pussy.  Sure.  Yeah.  Okay.  That's something you do, yeah.  Look ass?  No.  I mean, I would.  Oh, God.  Oh. 
[02:07:00]  But what sound does it make when you eat the pussy?  Yeah.  Yeah, it actually doesn't make a sound.  I forgot, though.  Yeah.  Yeah, what is it?  I'm sure we have it.  We do, but I was just wondering if you remember.  Yeah, what sound?  I mean, I don't know if I could duplicate.  Go ahead.  Give it a shot.  Give it a try.  Go ahead.  I think the sound...  I don't know what sound.  Did your tongue really come out like that when you eat pussy?  I can't.  I would have to have one in front of you.  Do you just lap at the lips?  No, I'm not.  I know what I'm doing.  You do?  I know what I'm doing. 
[02:07:30]  I've seen Sam at a movie with a bucket of popcorn, eating popcorn like a turtle, where  he just kind of opens his mouth and just kind of pecks at the popcorn with his tongue.  How do you do it?  Well, you just go...  Because the butter is on it, you don't want to get your fingers all greasy, so you just  put the popcorn and go...  Are you kidding me?  And it's popcorn sticks to your tongue.  So you don't use your hands...  You're a fucking fly!  Exactly.  That's the type of...  You just kind of stick your tongue out and let the popcorn get stuck to your tongue,  and then just for that top bit while it's still warm and still very buttery, because 
[02:08:00]  you don't want to get your fingers greasy.  Because you're not going to do it like halfway into the bucket.  That's ridiculous.  You're a weirdo.  You're a weirdo.  He's a little boy.  Do you order off kids' menus?  No.  At some of these restaurants?  I bet you do.  Why not?  They have all the food you would want.  I don't like to make a fuss.  Yeah, he just won't eat?  He's not demanding about it.  He'll just sit there and not eat.  Yeah, I just won't, or I'll say, you know, can you make this plain?  If not, whatever.  Jesus.  I'm good with bread.  All right, let's take a break. 
[02:08:30]  This is amazing.  I am stunned.  Yeah.  830.  Learned something new, though.  That's nice.  830.  Yeah, if you want to get an adult circumcision, go for it.  Oh, yeah, that's worth the start with.  It'll take a couple weeks to heal fully before it stops hurting, but it'll be worth it.  Did mommy kiss it all better?  No.  See, that's one of those ugly comments.  No, sorry.  That's an ugly comment.  That's the Bobby again.  Did she rub that, like, that lubey stuff on it to help it heal?  I mean, because that's what I'm doing with my kids, so I would imagine.  I was fully able to do it myself. 
[02:09:00]  I think it's like a Vaseline type of thing.  You now owe her an apology, too, I think.  Bobby, I'm really sorry, because I really like you a lot.  Thank you.  I mean, I really like Bobby.  Baby, you got a boo-boo.  Okay, that's...  I really like Bobby.  It's been two years.  It's not going to be a little more.  You don't have to rub in the Bacitracin by hand really quickly.  Well, you apologized, and you went back to the...  No, it's like she's giving me a hand job.  Well, you're thinking...  Bacitracin really quick.  That's not where he was going. 
[02:09:30]  I mean, I don't think any...  I think a lot of what happened here this morning...  Shouldn't have.  Danny has a picture of your cock on the screen.  That's not.  That's a salami with a wrapper around it.  Oh, I'm sorry.  The tip is tied shut.  You think she'd apply it very fast?  Yes, very rapidly.  That's ridiculous.  She wouldn't apply it at all.  Why?  You got to get the medicine on it.  I put the medicine on myself.  And the only reason you go really quickly, because, you know, you're going to try to push 
[02:10:00]  your hands away.  You want to get it in...  You've got to get it in deep into the wound, so she would really crank on it.  You don't have to get it.  I mean, it's fine.  And I took care of it myself.  Oh, good.  Without doing it rapidly.  Oh, okay.  I misunderstood.  Yeah, I hope so.  I have a feeling we're going to all have to fucking send Bobby flowers today.  An apology note to flowers.  She's going to get a lot of flowers today from us.  I hope so.  She deserves it after this.  Bobby's terrific.  Bobby's terrific.  And none of this came from me. 
[02:10:30]  This is all from...  Of course not.  No, no.  All right, listen, from you guys.  We got a break.  Slash is coming in at 9.30.  We'll do a little more radio before Slash.  Stay there.  Oh.  You're listening to the Opie and Anthony show on Sirius XM.  O.N.A. 
[02:11:00]  Moving right along.  Slash coming in at 9.30.  I think this is off his album, right?  Just playing some of the hooks from his new CD.  That's called Slash.  I Hold On?  Okay.  The Kid Rock song?  I love that one.  I tell you, my favorite one is a weird one at the end.  It's...  Oh, God.  What's the last...  I'm sorry.  It's Saints and Sinners.  Saint is a Sinner by that Rocco DeLuca.  Man, I love that song. 
[02:11:30]  And we got a copy of Paradise City.  We're going to have to ask him about this.  Who's singing this?  The last copy of the CD doesn't have Paradise City.  He did that with Fergie and Cypress Hill.  You sure it's not secret hidden?  Not on our copy.  I can't find it.  Well, how is Fergie's first song?  I know it was a bonus track, but not on the one we got.  Don't you have to sit there, though, and wait, and wait, and wait, and then...  It tells you how long the track is.  Yeah, but what if it's, like, tricky? 
[02:12:00]  No, it's not tricky.  I'm telling you.  Well, Fergie has one song.  Fergie.  That's actually how you say it.  This will be the end of the song right here.  Watch, okay?  All right.  How the fuck do you do this?  Hold on a minute.  Yeah.  Fuck.  Language.  It's my home, young man.  That's how it ends.  This is how it ends, right?  And usually the bonus track, you watch it just, you know, and then it just stops, see? 
[02:12:30]  CD player stops.  There's no bonus track, so I'm confused.  It's a B-side, I think, on the Japan release.  You know what?  On a Japan release?  Why do they do that?  That happens a lot.  They do that a lot.  Ozzy's new album has a song that's only for Japanese release, too.  Why is that?  I don't know, but Japanese releases tend to have, like, one or two extra bonus tracks  a lot of the time.  Why are the Japs special?  Yeah.  What about us Americans?  We want the bonus track.  And they'll normally show up a lot of times, like, on maybe, like, the B-side of a single 
[02:13:00]  later on, but it's on Slash's album in Japan.  I don't know.  I really don't know.  But it's been happening for decades.  Yeah, I noticed the same thing on Scream.  I was like, what the fuck?  I want to hear these extra songs, but they're only for Japanese release.  I'm going to ask Slash angrily in the hallway.  Yeah, we're going to have to ask, but we have a copy.  You want to hear how Paradise City sounds with Fergie and Cypress Hill?  Fergie is very good.  Fergie.  Fergie.  Fergie. 
[02:13:30]  Yes, yes, you're on.  You don't stop.  You keep on.  Look in the place.  We got my main man Slash.  In the place.  We got the Cypress Hill.  In the place.  And we got the Duchess.  Fergie.  And it's like that.  It's hard steaks.  It's killing me.  Just an urgent living under the street.  I'm a hard case.  We'll talk the beat. 
[02:14:00]  I'm a chariot case.  So buy me something to eat.  I'll pay you out another.  Yeah.  Take it to the end of the line.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Come on.  Right.  The riches are so they say.  You gotta keep pushing for the fortune in vain.  You know it.  It's all that gamble when it's just a game.  You treat it like a capital crime. 
[02:14:30]  Everybody's doing the time.  Take me down to the paradise city where the grass is green and the grass is green and the girls are pretty.  Oh, won't you please take me home.  Yeah.  Take me down to the paradise city where the grass is green and the girls are pretty.  Take me home.  Stopped in the chair of the city's gas chamber. 
[02:15:00]  Why I'm here can't quite remember.  The surgeon general says it's hazardous to breathe.  I've smoked another cigarette but I can't see.  Tell me who you're gonna believe.  Come on.  Take me down to the paradise city where the grass is green and the girls are pretty.  Take me home.  Yeah. 
[02:15:30]  Take me down to the paradise city where the grass is green and the girls are pretty.  Oh, won't you please take me home.  Take me home.  guitar solo 
[02:16:00]  So far away  So far away  So far away  Captain America's been gone apart now 
[02:16:30]  He's a poor chester with a broken heart, he said  Tell me around and take me back to the start  I must be losing my mind, are you blind?  I must be losing my mind  Take me down to the paradise city  Where the grass is green and the girls are pretty  Take me home, yeah  Take me down to the paradise city  Where the grass is green and the girls are pretty  Oh won't you please take me home 
[02:17:00]  Take me down to the paradise city  Where the grass is green and the girls are pretty  Take me home  Take me down to the paradise city  Where the grass is green and the girls are pretty  Oh won't you please take me home, yeah  I want to go 
[02:17:30]  Oh won't you please take me home, yeah  I want to see who I can't believe  Oh won't you please take me home, yeah 
[02:18:00]  Take me home, yeah  Take me down to the paradise city  Where the grass is green and the girls are pretty  Oh won't you please take me home, yeah  I want to see who I can't believe  Oh won't you please take me home, yeah 
[02:18:30]  Wow, we were only going to play a piece of that, but wow  I wish it was pure Fergie without Cypress Hill  I would rather have just heard Fergie saying that  She was fucking unbelievable  Yeah, Cypress Hill, you know  Cypress Hill kind of, you know  Their little thing in the beginning  And then Fergie  Urbaned it up  Fergie knocked it out of the fucking, out of the park  They urbaned it up  I mean look, Axl's singing Paradise City  You know, you can't trash it whatsoever  But as far as an interpretation  Fergie did a great job on that  I don't think Fergie did a bad job doing that 
[02:19:00]  Holy shit  It's cool to hear her like a rocker too  But that, uh, that Cypress Hill  Yeah, I prefer, they weren't terrible  But I would rather, she was so good  I would rather have just heard her  Everything just sounds like that  Yeah  I thought  I just want to say her name again  Fergie  No  Fergie  Fergie  Fergie  Fergie  Fergie  I like the way Fergie did that  Well that's  Fergie was pretty good 
[02:19:30]  That's not all Slash's, uh, CD  When he comes in, please let's just say his name  Only say her name like that  I will, absolutely  Like that's the proper way to say it  And he'll be like, what?  He'll say, no, it's actually Fergie  Fergie  That's how she pronounces it  Yeah  When is he coming in?  9.30  9.30  9.30  I love the CD, man  I usually don't like new music, as everybody knows 
[02:20:00]  But I love all the music I heard yesterday  You know, when you talk music, I mean, looking at the feedback  A lot of people love it  And a lot of people are like, eh  Do they think that she wasn't good, though?  People hate it  They hate Fergie  They hated, um  They might not have liked Cypress Hill  But how do you not like Fergie?  I liked Fergie, the way she sounded in that  She had a good, uh  They don't like the re-imaging of it  But, I mean, it's  Slash gave his stamp of approval  To go, hey, man, this sounds cool 
[02:20:30]  Let's do it this way  Sarah in Buffalo writes  Sarah  Sarah goes, I get it  But Fergie has not earned the right to remake a Guns N' Roses song  Period  Tell Sarah to stop being melodramatic  Earn the right  Tough call, even though Slash invited her to do it  That's the key  Slash, this isn't a cover band  Slash, you know  The guy that probably wrote the fucking music for the song  Yeah  Said, Fergie, come on in and sing this for me  I think it would be kind of cool  Uh, just tough to hear anyone but Axl and the boys do this 
[02:21:00]  Yeah, but Axl's a fucking dick  Axl doesn't want to perform at Slash  What do you want from  What do you want Slash to do?  How many years ago was the last time they did that together?  Don't worry about it  But a lot of people are, uh  Are, uh  Were wowed by Fergie, uh  Fucking belting that out  For, who?  Fergie  I don't know who you're talking about  He's not making up people  Making up people  I don't know who this lady is  God damn 
[02:21:30]  But the fuck  It's, I mean  He just gets everyone  I mean, fucking IG Pop  I mean, to be able to pull that off  Keep going  Uh  Yeah, I don't  I don't  I think, like, yeah  Cypress Hill could have been  Keith J is like  The song needed to be redone  It's  Slash is putting out a whole CD  Of new music  And said, you know what  Let's have fun with one of my old songs  Simmer down, Keith  There are  Everyone calm the fuck down  Hardcore  Fucking Guns N' Roses fan 
[02:22:00]  Fans that will not allow  Anything to  Defile their sacred collection  I think that's why  He invited Cypress Hill  To really change it up  So it doesn't sound  Right  Exactly like the original  I love  That's probably why  He went in that direction  Don't you love a good cover?  I mean, it's  Because it doesn't  Change the original song  You don't  It's not like the original song  Is being replaced  Yeah  You don't earn the right  Get a hold of yourself, lady  She has not  Earned the right  She's gotta be around 
[02:22:30]  For a while  Don't worry about it  I think Fergie is  Earned the right  She's sold a few records  In the last few years  Holy fuck  Yeah, maybe a couple, huh?  Holy fuck  Let's go to Footer  Footer  Hello  Hello  Hey, I had a question  With the slash  She's not in there, though, yet  Exactly  So why don't you  Ask it later  There might be a little  Controversy  If you're asking  I don't know if you can answer  But if he were the artist 
[02:23:00]  That he wanted to get to sing  Said either contractually  Like they couldn't do it  And then there's a few  That didn't want to do it  Maybe we can like  Press them  Well, the reason I took the call  Is I heard Jack White  Said no to slash  Yeah  And that's a biggie  Jack White said no  To slash's  Imitation  I don't know  We'll ask slash  When he comes in here  That's a surprise  Were any of them being dicks of  Who are they  A lot of them away  Who else have you heard, Footer?  Because, I mean, he's got  An all-star lineup  On this fucking CD  I heard Mel Tillis  Turned him down  Mel Tillis 
[02:23:30]  I'm glad  I'm  Mel Tillis on that  I'm glad he did get  Ferticky  But that's a good thing  Jack White  Vince Neal  What?  Wow, really?  Somebody says  Vince Neal  Jesus  But I'm just reading  I heard Jim Neighbors  Said no  Yes, Jim Neighbors  To sing  Oh My Papa  And he'll suck his dick  At the same time 
[02:24:00]  Big flaming wuss  Gomer Pyle  Shut up  I'll call back later  Punch it out, boys  Alright  Yeah, I mean  That wasn't  You got turned down  By a lot of people  Yeah  That's a shame  Any more on the list?  I just heard a bunch  Yeah?  Like who?  I can't think of anybody  I wanted to get 
[02:24:30]  Jack White to sing  On something  But he didn't want to sing  Slash told musicradar.com  He said  I'll play drums  I'll play guitar  But I don't want to sing  He was one guy  That I wanted to work with  Pretty much everyone else  That I went after  I managed to get  So why did he let him  Play drums?  What the fuck  Is going on with Jack White?  He's a singer  Why didn't he want to sing?  Exactly  What's wrong with him?  And someone's saying  That Fergie was a rock singer  Before  She got into Black Eyed Peas  Before she was a pop fucking 
[02:25:00]  Superstar  Whatever that is  Yeah  A pop superstar  Don't want to be a spoiler  For anybody out there  That didn't see Lost  So I won't give any details  Or anything  I did  How about we warn them  We're going to spoil it  Give them a few seconds  Yeah?  You want to do that?  Yeah  But it's coming  Let you know it's coming  This is the last  While you're tuning off  The last regular season episode  Was last night  And then Sunday  At 7 Eastern  We get a what?

It's going to be one of those  Pop up losts  Because they never did the pilot 
[02:26:00]  With you know  Oh with the pop up?  With the information on them  And then  So what's their  What's their fucking gimmick here?  Why play the pilot  If they're not going to do something  To try to  Get more money  They're probably going to close it out  With tie ins to the pilot  Yeah  Oh okay  Yeah they're just making it  Like a lost weekend  Yeah it's lost weekend  Nice  I was very annoyed  At the amount  Of commercials  Last night  I noticed more commercials  Than I've ever seen  On any lost episode  It was crazy  It was good though right? 
[02:26:30]  Seven minutes of fucking programming  And then fucking  Ten minutes of commercials  Yeah I liked it  I enjoyed it  I figured you'd like it  Oh boy thank God  I'm not going to say any name  But somebody got her throat cut  Yay  Yay  Yeah when that happened  That was great  It was great to see  Ben get his ass  Handed to him again  We haven't seen Ben  Get beat up  In quite a while  But now he looks the same  As he did  Yes  He's all beat up  He looks the same  And then 
[02:27:00]  On the flash sideways  You have tender  Sentiments Ben  Very tender  Very sweet  Caring Ben  And then  On the other side  On the island  He has just  Completely lost  His fucking shit  Yeah  I think he's just  Resigned himself  To the fact that  This is it  He's going to  Fucking die somehow  And he doesn't care  And he wants to  Kill as many people  As he can  Really  Yeah  He's really turning evil  This is a very good  Episode last night  I love Desmond 
[02:27:30]  And when he pulled  When Ben pulled out  The pistol  And just starts shooting  When Locke is speaking  With a certain gentleman  Just a great scene  Well we're spoiling it  I mean  Well you know  Yeah we are spoiling it  You don't want to  Spurl every  Widmore  I was so happy  How great was that  It's just all of a sudden  He's starting to get shot  You're like  What the fuck just happened  And they go to Ben  And he's there with a pistol  Just  I've had it with this asshole  Yeah  He doesn't get to save  His daughter  He was  Now what do you think  About Alpert  He's 
[02:28:00]  Is he  You think he's still alive  I don't think they gave him  A big enough send off  The smoke monster came  Of course  And launched him  Launched him into a tree  And a roof or some shit  But then  We didn't see him after that  And I think a character  As pivotal  And huge  As he  Yeah  They would have given  A bigger  More dramatic send off  They didn't give Saeed  That big one  Even though he was fucking  But you knew he was dead  Like they show him  Carrying explosives  And blows up  Saeed  Dead  Richard Albert 
[02:28:30]  He kind of gets thrown  But he's  You know  Immortal  Kind of a thing  So who knows  Oh yeah  He can't die  Yeah  That was the thing  And also  I was mentioning  To Anthony earlier  Is that when  When Echo died  Or usually  When the smoke monster  Kills somebody  You see him  You know  Smashing the guy  Like on  On a tree  Or on the ground  You didn't see  What he did with Richard  No  They just launched him  They couldn't get  Echo back  For one episode  That's my impression  Of him  Oh yeah  Let me hear  Oh I'm Echo  That doesn't sound like 
[02:29:00]  I gotta find my brother  For those of you  That's no loss  It's a dead on Echo  It is really dead on  And there was a point  During last night's episode  Where I started laughing  Hysterically  When Desmond started  His car again  Oh it was great  I absolutely thought  He was just gonna run  The fuck over  John Locke again  Which would have been  Like a Looney Tunes cartoon  Hysterical  Like John Locke's  Coming back  They're like  Welcome back  Mr. Locke 
[02:29:30]  And he's wheeling  Himself across the lot  All still cut up  And everything  And if he would have  Whammed into him again  I'd have pissed myself  Laughing  Ben had the line  Of the night  When he was just like  Don't you even  Think about it  Yeah yeah  He just comes out  On the hood of his car  Don't you even  Think about it  Very good episode  I think that was good  And now we only have  The last one  I can't believe  Desmond Sam  We're so close  To it being over  Desmond Sam  I'm helping him  Let go  That was great  That was like  A lost  That felt like lost  The writing was good  It didn't feel like 
[02:30:00]  Fucking cheesy  They didn't weigh it down  With nonsense  Everything was kind of  Going somewhere  Yeah I kind of like that  And then when  Jacob by the fire  He goes  Sit down  And I'm going to  Tell you all  Why you're here  I just yelled out  I'm in my own  Movie theater  Watching it  I yell out  No you're not  I'm so jaded  And annoyed  That they don't  Wrap shit up  That I was expecting  To get no answer  But he gave an answer  To the people  And what do you think  Of this whole Jack thing  Taking up the role  I think it's not  Going to be him 
[02:30:30]  Where's that going to go  It already is  He drank the fucking  Shit or something  I think it's not  Going to be him  You think it's going to be  Fucking Fatso  I don't know  Because he doesn't want to  How great would it be  If they just introduced him  In the final episode  He's the guy  He guards the fridge  The golden light  Out of the fridge  Yeah it's supposed to be  Jack now  Takes care of the  Yeah I think it'll be  The island stuff  You think so  Yeah I kind of thought  That the last 
[02:31:00]  Maybe like couple months  It just it made sense  That out of the rest of them  It would be Jack  Yeah a lot of shit  A lot of shit going on  There's a lot of shit  For two and a half hours  No they're pretty much done  Yeah  Yeah  We got all the answers  Yeah do we  Yeah sure we do  Well good luck  You going to any lost parties  No  I know there's a few  I like paying attention  You know  There's a few lost parties  Going on with like  Dharma Initiative jumpsuits  And fucking  Dharma Initiative food  You can buy the  The lost like party kit

[02:37:30]  Oh it makes me laugh  Listen to this  Dummy  Deputies say this is definitely  Katrina Bryant  One of two women  Accused of threatening employees  At this Daytona Beach  Wendy's restaurant  Bryant and her friend  Melanie's Reed  Went through the drive-thru  Around 10 this morning  Employees say  Reed was really mad  Because she didn't get  The mayo and mustard  She ordered  And they say  She slapped the guy  Working in the window  According to this police report  Reed says  She pointed at the guy  Through the window  She says he grabbed her arm 
[02:38:00]  So she smacked him  To get him away  That worker says  Bryant and Reed  Disappeared  For a few minutes  They went to their cars  To get something  And they came back inside  And went behind the counter  And they're coming through  That's when I ran out  The back door  Police say  Reed was running  Through the restaurant  With this  A pink stun gun  And employees say  She was looking  For the drive-thru employee  The two women took off  And police put out an alert  Just hours later  Holly Hill police  Found them in a parking lot  And arrested them  Jesus  Fucking savages

[02:39:30]  You gotta realize  What you're reading  Let's get a Paul  In Florida  Paul  Hey  I'm gonna be watching  To see  On  As opposed to  Lost  See if  Bret Michaels  Is gonna be okay  On the  Trump show  Cause it's gonna be  Same time  Isn't it  Yeah  That's some big competition  For Lost  The Trump show  Celebrity Apprentice  With Bret Michaels  Coming back from the dead  To do the fucking  Live show  That show  Is fucking

[02:40:30]  Is on Oprah Winfrey  Today  He said he wore  The bandana  In the hospital  Because if he was  Gonna die  He wanted to  Go out  Rocking  Bret  Why would you  Say that  Rocking  Why would you  Say that  You gotta say  Something  Try to tell me  That Celebrity  Apprentice  Is in last place  In it's time slot  You know what  That Anthony  Is absolutely correct  Yeah I'm reading  Last week's ratings  And they were down  21% from the  Previous week  So how  How bad are the  Ratings  Well  Survivor  Well it was 
[02:41:00]  The Survivor  Finale  Got a 4-3  And Celebrity  Apprentice  Got a 2-2  That's still on  Survivor  Survivor's still on  I heard this year  Survivor was good  They brought back  A whole bunch  Of fucking  Weirdos  They dipped back  Into the well  Yep  It's averaging  Around 6 million  Celebrity  Apprentice  I  I  I don't know  How people watch  Those fucking shows  Like that  It's beyond me  And what is  Lost average  I think  Lost average  Is around 10 or 11  If I'm  If I'm remembering 
[02:41:30]  Correctly  Like those fucking  Just  Not reality shows  They annoy the  Piss out of me  I watch things like  Hoarders  That's great  Cause that's like  Reality  But it's  You know  Oh by the way  They had a  Intervention thing  A Hoarders reunion  We all met in a  Phone booth  There's a  Kind of a  Intervention update  On some people  And they had the 
[02:42:00]  Chick that fucking  Would huff the  Keyboard cleaner  They already did  That update  Unless it's another  Update  It's a whole  Like  She's doing well  It's pretty long  The color of her  Hair  Right  Yeah  Yeah  She's a blonde  Now or something  No I think  She's still had dark  Hair  In this one  Right  She uh  But she did a  Public service  Announcement at the  End  Like if you notice  Your child is doing  This that  And the other  Thing  You know  They might be  Inhaling  She's fine though  Yeah  She kind of  Like  She's kind of  Cute  And she was  So fucked up 
[02:42:30]  On that show  She's not annoying  When she's not  Doing that stuff  She was actually  Like  Yeah  She was like  Yeah I did this  Her eyes weren't  Crossed  And all fucked up  She was the greatest  But they also had  Other people  The best intervention ever  Did they have the one  That was naked  All the time  And they threw food  Into her apartment  Didn't have her  I think she was a  Stripper or something  People that died  They had like  Like a kid  Because it was a whole  Thing on huffing  And they had some  Kids that  That they were  Talking to their parents  And they were  On the show  Well no 
[02:43:00]  They weren't on the show  Oh they were other  Huffers  Yeah  Of the kids that died  Right  And it was  A death montage  Yeah  Sort of a death montage  Of the parents  Going like  We didn't know  That sucks  They were  Huffing  We didn't even know  What the word  Huffing meant  You know  Trying to hold it together  It's horrible  And one kid  They found him  Just laying there  With the straw  Still in his mouth  And the thing  Like on his chest  Like he just went  Like that  Like that  I didn't even know 
[02:43:30]  How that worked  It seems that the  Inhalant  Like that  That shit  Is so heavy  It's heavier than air  That it just sinks  Into your lungs  And pushes out  The shit you need  To breathe  So what you're  Really doing  Is getting a lack  Of oxygen to your brain  It gives you  That buzzy thing  Oh that's all it does  Hopefully you snap out of it  It's not a chemical thing  It's not  No the chemicals  Are pretty much  Secondary to just  The lack of oxygen  No shit  I didn't know that  And um  Wow  Goodbye  See ya  Goodbye  And they have 
[02:44:00]  The people that said  You know  I said  I'll see you later  And that was  The last time  I saw  Right  You weren't affected  By it  No it's like  One of those  You know  If you're gonna be  Stupid enough  To fucking  Huff paint  And gasoline  One kid's like  Uh  I huff gasoline  Because I could get  A half gallon  And it could keep me  High for like  A week  Gasoline  Ugh  How do you do that  You just  Fucking sniff it 
[02:44:30]  He had it in a  Regular gas can  So I don't  I don't know  How he was doing it  But uh  And then I saw  Another intervention  Where this chick  Was just doing  Every drug  Imaginable  And uh  It was all  Just about  Me  Me  Me  Help me  I need  This  Don't do that  And then the  Enabling family  And boyfriend  And she was  Pretty hot too  She was like  A model at one point  And they showed her  During her younger days  Like 19 years old  She had hooked up 
[02:45:00]  With a  A real  Known modeling firm  And everything  And she looked great  And then they showed her  Now all haggard  Fucking cracked out  Fucking shame  Should we  Step aside  Get ready for the  Slash interview  Get ready for Slash  Coming in at 930  Slash  Which is a few  Minutes away  Forgi  I love Forgi  Forgi  Forgi did a very  Good job  She did  Let's talk about  Forgi  Yeah did you  Was it hard to get  Forgi  Or was she available 
[02:45:30]  See if he even  Says anything  Yeah we were  We were surprised  Because Cypress Hill  Was good  But uh  Forgi  Really  We really liked  The way Forgi  Had uh  Sang that  He'll be  At some point  Why are you  Saying it like that  I love it  Uh yeah  We should  We should um  Take a breather  And be right back  Yeah let's do this man 
[02:46:00]  Very excited  We got Slash  Coming into the studio  And there he is  Slash  Hey man  What's up buddy  It's been a while  It has been  I gotta tell you  We only got the CD  A couple days ago  Slash  We're fucking  Loving it  Oh really  Yeah  We're loving it  Oh thank you  I had no idea  That you got all these 
[02:46:30]  Guys together for the CD  Until about a week ago  I put it together  Pretty quietly  Yeah  Yeah right  I was just sitting  In LA  And I wrote all the music  And I was like  And then I started  Figuring out who  Should sing on  Which song  And all that  And very quietly  There was no  Sort of management  Involved  No record companies  Or any of that  And we just sort of  Put it all together  And I went in the studio  And recorded it  And it was very very quiet  Every song has got  A different singer on it  I think you used  The same guy twice  But before he moves on 
[02:47:00]  From that  That's kind of interesting  Because you know  You have to deal with  Managers and all these people  But you were able to  Just use your connections  With these guys  And say hey  It was really just  Person to person  I didn't deal with  Their managers  That's just not how  It's done anymore  But that's  That's the only way  If you're going to  Creatively do something  Where it's just about music  And there's no reason  To involve all these other  Right  Third party  Did you have to pay  All these guys  Did you have to pay  No I mean  We did publishing splits  But the rest of the currency  Was really music 
[02:47:30]  That's cool  For the sake of a better word  I think my favorite song  On the album  Is Saint is a Sinner  And Rocco  I love that song man  Yeah I liked  The Lemmy one a lot  Showing a sensitive side  I really  I don't even know  Who Rocco is  But I loved  I loved  Lemmy's song  I loved Kid Rock's song  There was not a bad song  On the whole CD man  It's phenomenal  Yeah I mean  I gotta hang out here more often  It really is great  Well Slash  I mean  You got Ian Asbury  Ozzy  Fergie  We played  Oh we should ask him  Fergie yeah  Paradise City 
[02:48:00]  It's on the Japanese release of this  Paradise City  Was on the Japanese release  But now  It's also  I think  On the UK release  And the South American release  Not the American release  That's what I'm getting at here  Well the thing was  Initially I did it just for fun  And it was something  I used to perform with Cypress Hill  And I said one of these days  We should record this  And so when I was doing the solo record  I thought yeah let's do it now  But I didn't want people to take it too seriously  And put it on the main album  So I just sort of released it as a B-side  I knew it would find its way back through the internet  Oh yeah there you go 
[02:48:30]  And we played the whole song  We were going to only play a little piece  You should have heard the immediate backlash  I got from all the  Guns N' Roses  Yeah that's it  We had a few of them calling our show  What the fuck is wrong with that  And so they just take it way too seriously  And I'm like  Slash put his stamp of approval on this  And Fergie did a great job  Yeah she did  And she's a huge Axl fan  So it was like a big thrill for her  To come in and do it  Yeah we were going to play a little piece  And it kicked in  And we said we have to play this whole thing  Went to a strip bar last night though  And I was in there for two seconds 
[02:49:00]  And the DJ all of a sudden  I hear this drum beat  And I go I know that song  And it was Paradise City  It sounded great there  And they played Beautiful Dangerous too  It always sounds a little better at a strip club  Yeah  It's the way to do it  I didn't think Fergie had that inner  Yeah that was the whole point  I jammed with her about three and a half years ago  I got invited to do a fundraiser with the Black Eyed Peas  And they had all these different guests coming up  And I get there before Fergie 
[02:49:30]  I'd never even seen Fergie before  I didn't know what she looked like or anything  I just knew her from the radio  So they said okay we're going to do this rock medley  And it's going to be the Zeppelin song  Black Dog, Live and Let Die, Barracuda  And something else  So we learned it  And just at the tail end of Soundcheck  She showed up  And she got up  And she sang Black Dog  And it just blew my mind  And so from that point on  We've been pretty tight  Yeah she's got a good rock voice  Well that's where she comes from  Yeah  That's her roots  I didn't know that until today  And then what happens with a lot of girls  Like I did a song with Nicole Scherzinger 
[02:50:00]  And Alice Cooper as well  And I didn't know that she  Alice Cooper's the guy though  Yeah no  But they sang together  Yeah yeah yeah  Anyway but I wasn't expecting a lot from her  And she's got a kick ass voice  That you've never heard  Because in rock and roll  Girls just can't get a foot in the door  So they end up sort of veering into pop  They go pop  Yeah it was a great job though  Well I want to keep going down  So you've got Ozzy, Fergie, Chris Cornell  We love Chris Cornell  Chris was great  Yeah that's another guy  That could just  One of my favorite rock voices  Is Chris Cornell  He was great to work with 
[02:50:30]  Really really cool  Great guy right  Yeah we've had him in here a few times  And just a nice guy and shit  Yeah very sort of unassuming  Yeah yeah  And meanwhile it's like  Yeah you have one of the definitive voices  Of the 90s  And you know just a regular guy  Probably one of the best  One of the best rock and roll voices  To come out of the 90s  I've said that like for years  The guy has a range that's amazing  And just that real raspy rock voice  He can get going  It sounds fantastic  What's your favorite song of the CD?  Do you have one if you had to pick one?  It's you know because  I'm way too close to it 
[02:51:00]  I mean when you do an album like this  As opposed to like making a record  With one or two singles on it  And the rest of it's just filler  You really get into every song  And you get very attached to each one  So you don't really have like your favorite  It's cool because you get like  It takes years to get that perspective  You get like the best effort of every singer  That's the great part  So you get a great lead singer  To do like the best song on the album  That they would do  Before, during, or after you're writing the song  Did you realize who you wanted to sing it?  Like were there some that  Right as you're writing it  You're like  Alright I know who's got to do this  Right  I mean you know what I did  Was I set out just to write some music 
[02:51:30]  I hadn't really planned on doing this whole  I didn't sit down and go  Okay I'm going to write a record  With all these different people  Right  I was just collecting  I had some material I wrote on the road  I had some material I was writing at present  And I started to compile that  And then I had  You know  Then I sort of focused on the idea  Of having the singers on it  So I would listen to one piece of music  And go  You know what  This is definitely  I actually  The Ozzy song  When I wrote it  I thought Ozzy would sound  Ozzy yeah  Then when I decided to do the record  Just go  Go with it  Right  So everybody 
[02:52:00]  Everybody was just sort of picked  According to the music  You know  And Jimmy  Sitting right next to you  Biggest Ozzy fan  There he is  It was so cool to be over at his house  And working with him  And have that voice  That I've been listening to  Since I was like  Literally on acid  When I was 13  But he's singing something you wrote  That's got to be great too  Oh man  It was a huge honor  And Iggy Pop  And Lemmy  I mean  You know  Those are huge heroes of mine  Alice Cooper  Who's not on this version of the record  But  You know  And then  And then getting people like Kid Rock 
[02:52:30]  To do it  And Chris Cornell  And people who I think  Dave Grohl  Dave Grohl  Yeah  Duff's been in here a few times  In the last year or two  And he's  What a great guy  He's such an awesome bass player  And it's  Like in Velvet Revolver  It's one thing  We're all in it together  But to do this one song  And have Dave there  And then  Hearing Duff from a different perspective  Where we're just sort of  Throwing this thing together  Just you know  He's just phenomenal  So they were all  It's amazing  You got all these people  Was there anybody you wanted  That you couldn't get  That is the most commonly asked question  Having to do with this record 
[02:53:00]  There was pretty much  I got everybody that I wanted  There was two incidents  One guy whose record company  Wouldn't allow it  And another one where  It was just taking too long  To get it together  And I was like  I got  Well Jack White was one of the guys  Jack was not  Jack was somebody  Oh really that's  At the very very  This is why I don't mention names  Okay  Because it always gets blown  It gets twisted out of  Because that is out there  That he said no  So it's good that you're saying  It's sort of true  What happened was  Mark Ronson  The producer  Was originally  Who I talked to 
[02:53:30]  About producing this  Way like in the very  Very very beginning  And he mentioned  Jack White  And talked to him  About something  And Jack was like  Indifferent about singing  But he offered his services  To play drums or guitar  Or bass  Or whatever else  I could be looking for  And I was like  At the time  It wasn't really a big deal  Any which way  And so it was very casual  And I mentioned that  In an interview  And it turned into  Like this permanent thing  See rumors get started  Because I heard that  Steve Lawrence  Anita Gourmet  Told you to go fuck yourself  No they told me 
[02:54:00]  To go fuck myself  And die  Oh see  Rumors  Just I don't even know  How this happens  Is this mine  Yes  Sure  Yes  Certainly  And also  We didn't mention  Andrew Stockdale yet  From Wolf Mother  I love Wolf Mother  Andrew was  There was a small handful  Of people on the record  That I only knew  Their voices  I'd never met them before  And Andrew was one of them  And I had this one song  That I was like  This is really cool  And the guy from Wolf Mother  Would be perfect  So I tracked him down  It took me like a month  To track this guy down 
[02:54:30]  It turned out he was in L.A.  So  Filing a restraining order  Against Slash  Yeah right  This guy's following me  Some guy in glasses  Won't leave me alone  Pestering me  But  He was recording  Cosmic Egg  Like two blocks away  From where I was working  Yeah  And so I went over there  And we listened to  The demo that I made  And then got together  With some acoustic guitars  Worked it out  He wrote the chorus  Which was just like  This great sort of chorus  For that particular tune  And yeah  It's one of my favorite  Songs on the album  It's a cool song  Yeah absolutely  And I made it a single 
[02:55:00]  Because you know  I figured  By the sword  It's what I would consider  A very cool song  That's not like  Tailor made  To be an obvious single  You know  I wanted to go that road  As opposed to  To like going  Oh here's the big single  Off the record  You know  I want something  That would be more  Rock and roll  Sure  Was it easy to put together  Or was it kind of  Did you give the singers  A lot of leeway  As far as  How they wanted to interpret it  Or were you pretty much  Hands on  You know  It was  It was  I just  I put music together  Sometimes an entire  Like arrangement 
[02:55:30]  From top to bottom  Sometimes it would just be  Three parts  You know  Like a riff  A verse  And a chorus  Or whatever  And it was really  An open template  For vocalist  To do whatever  He wanted to  If he wanted to  Change the arrangement  If he wanted  Like the Iggy Pop song  And the Fergie song  Were exactly as I wrote them  Whereas with Kid Rock  We wrote that song  From the ground up  You know  I had a couple riffs  And a couple parts  And we really worked together hard  You know  To get the arrangement  The way it is  When you write  Do you write lyrics first  Or do you hear like 
[02:56:00]  A melody in your head first  I  With this  I just let the singers  Write the lyrics  Oh  Yeah  I try not to  I try to avoid  Writing lyrics  If I don't have to  I have a couple suggestions  On the record  But that's about it  So you give them a beat  And then you say  Okay can you put something  To this  Well I give them  Some chords  Some music  No but I mean  Like it like this  Write something  Asshole  I don't mean  I should have said that  But I mean  You give them the music  I think that's  The funniest question  I've heard  On this record so far  So basically you're saying  Slash didn't do anything  For his own record 
[02:56:30]  No I didn't mean that  Is that what you're saying  Yeah  One two three  One two three  No I mean like  Will you actually put the music down first  And then say  Okay I want you to  Yeah I put together  A presentable demo  Which is a stretch for me  But I put together  A presentable demo  And just sent it to them  And then  And they could do  Whatever they wanted  Why do you find  Words are difficult  Because obviously  You're a musician  You're very good  At what you do  Especially musically  Writing  Why do you find  Words are  More difficult  Well for me  It's a personality thing  I mean I've done it before 
[02:57:00]  And I'll do it  When I have to do it  But I'm  I'm very  Sort of closed off  When it comes to  Expressing my emotional  Being  You know  Yeah  I'm not real  Communicative  About that  So I hate putting  My thoughts and feelings  On paper  And I definitely  Don't want to sing  About them  So I try to leave it  To people who do that  For a living  If I can get away with it  I was YouTubing  Makes sense yeah  I was YouTubing  Slash last night  And your version  Of Tangerine  That's online  Is there a version 
[02:57:30]  Of Tangerine online  That's with Andrew  Right  With Andrew Stockdale  Wow that was the first time  We ever played it  Really  Yeah  You put together  Some kind of  Slash and Friends show  Yeah I've done a few  Of them  Was that before the record  That was  That led to the record  Probably  No no no  That was  We did that show  Probably when I was  In the studio  Actually recording it  And I'd already recorded  By the sword  With Andrew at that point  But I've done a few  Of those shows  Where some of them  Before the record  Some of them during  During  Did one in Norway  A couple in Vegas 
[02:58:00]  One in Los Angeles  It looked like  It was a cool show  It's fun  And freaking Slash  Comes out with the  Double neck  To do Tangerine  Like right on  Old school  You don't see  The double neck anymore  That was actually  One of the first  Zeppelin songs  One of the first songs  Actually I ever learned  Was Tangerine  I love that whole album  Have you talked to  Any of these people  About maybe  Popping out live  And doing some of this shit  Well it's  It's not something  You can really plan ahead  Yeah exactly  If you're in the same city  You're both in the same city  At the same time  You know  Whatever 
[02:58:30]  Then you try and  Pull it together  Did you think about that  You made an album  That you can't really tour  Well you know  When I was making the record  I've never made a record  That I didn't tour on  So like halfway  Through the making of it  I was like  I gotta do something  So I started looking  At singers that were  You know  Could be able to do  Comparable  Like a few songs  Off of this record  And do some of the  Other catalog stuff  And at the very end  Of making the record  The last song that I did  Was a song called  Starlight with Miles Kennedy  And I  There was two songs 
[02:59:00]  On the record  That I wasn't familiar  With the guys  That I ended up picking  I just  By circumstances  I ended up working with them  Rocco DeLuca  For the  Sane is the Sinner  And Starlight  With Miles Kennedy  And I sent him this song  Out of the blue  Just because I was looking  I couldn't figure out  Who would sing the song  And he sent me back  Starlight  And I'm just blown away  So I talked to him  About doing the tour  And he just happened to be  On a break from Alter Bridge  And he's probably  One of the most amazing  At least for me  New singers  You know  He's been around  For a little while 
[02:59:30]  But one of the most  Phenomenal new singers  I've heard  In a really long time  And no attitude right  Well you know  He's a guitar player  So the only reason  So he's got to be cool  No the only reason  He's a singer  Is because he had  So many pain in the ass singers  Singers  He started singing himself  So yeah he's very late  At least you've never  Had to deal with that though  That's the good thing  Well yeah  So you guys were able  To relate a little bit  He and I get along  Really well  I don't know what it is  Yeah some singers man  Jesus Christ  You know I think it's just  To be a singer  You know it's like  As a guitar player 
[03:00:00]  And that's my vehicle  For expressing myself  But it is a tool  That it's sort of  Connected to your body  But being a singer  Is something  That's a whole personality  It's a whole delivery  It's a whole  Like your whole physical  Being is involved  And you have to  Look people in the eye  And you're singing  About what you feel about  It's probably a whole  Different mindset  And I can't relate anyway  So  But a lot of guys  Pull it off  Without the attitude  Some people do  I mean  One of the great ones  Is Roger Daltrey  I mean  An amazing vocalist 
[03:00:30]  That doesn't spend  Too much time  Worrying about  What he's doing  Sammy Hagar  Is another one  Been doing it forever  And it's just effortless  I love Sammy  Big fan of Sammy Hagar  I wasn't too happy  With Chicken Foot  Yeah he wasn't a fan  Of the Chicken Foot record  Not a big fan  Of the Chicken Foot  And then Brian Johnson  Just my opinion  That's all  And I'm a huge Sammy Hagar  Fan so  Yeah  Anyway  So Brian Johnson  He's going to kick your ass  No actually  You know  I mean all things considered 
[03:01:00]  It's taste  I mean all things considered  Let's move along  It's taste  You know  So  Brian Johnson  Yeah Brian's another one  Just really  You know  Somebody who just does  What he does  And he's good at it  And doesn't  You know  Worry about it  Doesn't he have  I heard that the rest  Of the guys  Write the lyrics  Write the songs  And he just kind of  Shows up and fucking  They put him in front of him  And he sings  That's true  Yeah  Yeah that's true  So he gets shot  Same with Roger  For that matter  Pete writes all this stuff  Right yeah  It's Pete's birthday today  Is it really  Happy birthday Pete  One of my favorite  All time guitar players 
[03:01:30]  65 though  Yeah  I thought he was older  Oh really  Yeah  Maybe he is  Don't ever let him  Hear you say that  That's not a compliment  No I  Yeah I thought he was older  Just because  You know  It just seems like  He's been around forever  But uh  Right  All the old classics  Are all hitting the 60s  You know  Somewhere in there  Yeah  That's fucked up  When you grow up on  It does tick by  What were your bands  Growing up  Well you know  When I was a little kid  I was born in England  So I spent some time there  And it was all about  The Who  The Beatles 
[03:02:00]  The Stones  The Kinks  The Yardbirds  And then when I moved  To America  Then it was The Doors  You know  And that was like  What I was growing  That was the music  The background music  For my childhood  So you know  There was all that  But I mean  I was into Zeppelin  When I was a kid  And Black Sabbath  And then I was into  You know  War  Isaac Hayes  You know  David Bowie  Linda Ronstadt  Believe it or not  Because my mom  Made clothes for her  Joni Mitchell  Steely Dan 
[03:02:30]  I wanted to say  Cat Stevens  I mean  Neil Young  Everybody  You know  It was like  My musical background  Is really pretty  Wide  Pretty varied  You know  Damn  Yeah  Because I was raised  Into the music  Music thing  Yeah of course  Yeah yeah  We were saying yesterday  Not that it matters anymore  But one of the best  Rock books  Written by  You slash  My book  Yeah  Your book was amazing  Oh thank you  I mean  I haven't read it  Since I wrote it  So  We wanted to ask you 
[03:03:00]  About Scott Weiland  Because he was in here  Yesterday  Not in our studio  But  Perish the thought  You guys really found out  On stage that he was done  With Velvet Revolver  Well you know  Because his wife said that  She came in to promote her book  Yeah this is  The reality of what happened  With that is we  Had  Okay we  Because you guys had  A good thing going  Yeah Scott's a good guy  And I don't want to  I don't  I'm definitely not  On the same kind of  Bitter  Whatever  Thing that  That has been going on  With Axel and I  But at the time 
[03:03:30]  Velvet Revolver  Definitely had a lot  Of ups and downs  A lot of more  Chemical related  And that involved  Everybody in the band  We all went through  Our own thing  But with Scott  That last record  During the tour  We just sort of  Lost him  You know  He was just out there  And so we ended up  Canceling Australia  And Japan  And so that was it  That was  That was the final straw  So we had  A UK tour  Left over  And we actually  Auditioned people  To do the tour 
[03:04:00]  Instead of Scott  And Scott was in rehab  And then we thought  Who are we kidding  We got two weeks  Till these dates come up  And if we show up  In London  With somebody  Other than Scott  They're going to be pissed  Yeah  So we never talked  To Scott about this  So he got out of rehab  We went to the UK  We never told him a word  He was done  Then  So he had nothing  To do with it  But there was this one  Show that we did  Where he  Was tripping out  Because he thought  That the drum tech  Was singing along with him  Through his little  Headphone mic  I don't need to laugh 
[03:04:30]  And he was  He was seriously convinced  And pulled  There was like  An axle moment  Where he walked  Off the stage  And took off  Into the dressing rooms  While we were still playing  Based on this illusion  Right  So when he did  Finally  We went and got him  And brought him back  On stage  And he said  This is the last  Velvet Revolver show  And we're all going  With you  It was one of those  Kind of things  So we never said  Word one to him  For that whole UK tour  So whatever he told you  He had no idea  What was going on  And when we got 
[03:05:00]  To Amsterdam  That was our last show  We went  After the show was over  We put out a press release  Saying we were  No longer  Working with him  How much do you want  To smack a singer  Whoever it is  When one member  Of the band  Is just fucking  Making it all about  Themselves  And being a drama queen  You're like  There's four of us  Yeah  I mean  But you know  All things considered  Scott's a pretty  You know  He has  That side of him  Which was really difficult  But then the other side  Of him  He's really  Really a cool guy  And now that I'm not  In a band with him  I love him to death 
[03:05:30]  But in a band with him  You know  And it's not  You know  Like  I mean  He's had his issues  With STP as well  Where you know  Rob and Dean  Are like  Jeez  You know  Yeah  So it's just the way  That Scott is  In a band situation  He doesn't necessarily  Play well with others  You know  As far as  The group  Kind of mentality  See this is why  Slash is going to live  To be 90  Because you don't stress  He's just like  There's nothing  That bothers this guy  You just go with the floor  Yeah man  That's a better way to live  Yeah no kidding  I can learn from you Slash 
[03:06:00]  Yeah that's all  That's all to put on  I'm stressed out  All the time  He's boiling inside  Last time you were in  Speaking of Velvet Revolver  You were hinting  That you guys  Were close to a new singer  Now  We haven't talked in a while  So is that  Is that something  That is done now  Or yes  No we're still looking  Yeah  There's been a couple guys  That have come along  That have been really good  But not making any hasty decisions  I haven't  You know  Like if we're going to do  The next Velvet record  I want to make like  The Quiz Essential Velvet record  So I don't want to go  Picking anybody  Just because 
[03:06:30]  We're anxious  Right  You know  And I've been so busy  And Dust's busy  And Matt's busy  So there's no reason  To make any rash decisions  Yeah  But at some point  Next year  I would imagine  We're going to get together  And really go through  All the submissions  That we've gotten  Over the last six months  And also  See whatever new people  Have come along  And see if we can find  That thing that just clicks  You got a short list though?  Of people to try out?  No it's a long list now  Long list still?  Because the last six months  We haven't done anything  So it's been piling up  Do you get financial advice 
[03:07:00]  From Duff?  Well  All things considered  When Velvet was  On that last tour  That we did  You know  He was really helpful  In sort of like  Making sure  You know  Because we had  Really bad management  Not with Irving  But some of the other people  That were involved  And you know  And trying to keep track  Of the financial  Climate  And Velvet Revolver  At that time  Was something that  Duff was really on top of  Bad shady  Or bad just idiots? 
[03:07:30]  Actually  Totally both  Don't you think  At this point  In your career  You should be able  To smell bad management  Like a mile away?  Well there was one person  I won't name any names  That was involved  That I wanted to get rid of  From day one  Oh really?  She came part and parcel  With one of the guys  In the band  And it's just the way it was  And that probably had  A lot to do with  Why the band got so crazy  Because we couldn't stand her  What a spinal tap moment  That is  Holy shit  She's like  Oh death on too late  Queen nailed it on the head 
[03:08:00]  With that one  Hey  I want to play a song  Off the record  And then continue  With Slash  Is that cool?  Hey  Okay  That's fine with me  You want to play the single?  You can play whatever you want  But yeah  What do you want to hear?  What would you like to hear?  If you're going to play  More than one song  Play By the Sword first  And then we'll play  Something else afterwards  Alright we'll do  By the Sword  And then we'll end the show  With something else  Guaranteed  So it's Off Slash's new CD  Called Slash  This is Andrew Stockdale  Of Wolf Mother  Doing By the Sword  With Slash  If I get the right track here  And then we'll continue 
[03:08:30]  Come on  Oh  I had a perfect set up  For you Slash  What's the matter?  I don't know what's wrong here  How come you don't want to play it?  You didn't say  The Rock of New York  Or something  I mean the Photogy song  Played well  The only station that really rocks  And now the CD  Is stuck in the player  Photogy was great  I got it in here  You want it?  Yes  Classic  Why don't you play it from there?  Now it's stuck in the CD player  How come you don't want to play it?  Buy the Sword  Here  Buy the Sword  We happen to have  A hundred swords with us  From Slash's new CD  With the horses  With the horses that you ride  And the feelings left inside 
[03:09:00]  Cause it's time you need to leave all that behind  Well they claim they'd like to know  Anyone could let it go  And the people gather round for the last show  Well there is a war  To live and die  And the song 
[03:09:30]  Well they try to complicate you  But you left it all behind  All worldly possessions  All left for recollection  And finally it's all  They're releasing all the hounds 
[03:10:00]  What is last can still be found  When you hop up above your feet  It's your home  I'm not down  Well there's some who choose to run  Following the setting sound  And now it seems the journey  Has begun  Well there is a reward 
[03:10:30]  To live and die by the song  When they try to complicate you  But you left it all behind  All worldly possessions  A love for recollection  And finally it's all  Let's go 
[03:11:00]  Come on  Thank you. 
[03:11:30]  Thank you. 
[03:12:00]  Thank you. 
[03:12:30]  Thank you. 
[03:13:00]  Thank you. 
[03:13:30]  Thank you.  I Ain't No Nice Guy was great.  That was the song that we did together.  I actually had the lyrics to that song because I think the lyrics are great.  He's a great lyricist.  Amazing.  But I had the lyrics to that song in my acoustic guitar case for years because I just thought  they were so good.  That he actually wrote out or you just printed them out?  That he wrote on. 
[03:14:00]  There's a great version.  Ozzy's so good in that song.  But I always thought, God damn it, that was Lemmy's song.  And there's a version on YouTube of him and Phil just playing acoustic and him singing.  I think that's probably the best version.  Unbelievable.  Because there's something about the lyrics as it relates to Lemmy as a person that is  really poignant.  Yeah.  He's amazing.  And it's amazing he's still alive, too.  You know, that's what Dr. Alibi is all about.  It's one of the best songs on the record lyrically because it's something that I can relate to from  all my years of abusing myself. 
[03:14:30]  And Lemmy has found that if he stops abusing himself, then he will die.  And that's what the song's about.  It's just great.  Yeah.  I've been in places with him and his screen room is basically all he wants is sour cream  and onion potato chips, a book about Germany, and whiskey.  You know, during this session, my claim to fame is actually, you know, for the first time  doing my own record where I put the production together where I had to order him Jack Daniels.  Really?  It was very cool.  It was a big moment in my career. 
[03:15:00]  Yeah.  I got to sit down and have a couple of beverages.  Yeah.  Vegas.  Out in California.  He used to be, yes.  Oh, it was L.A.  It's a poker tournament.  I could always count on him if I happened to be in a place that wasn't our typical sort  of hangout, you know, like say, you know, for the Grammys.  They have these pre-Grammy parties.  I've seen you guys there when you do the radio shows.  Sure.  And if Lemmy's there, I always know he's holding.  Yeah.  He always have a flask on him, you know, holding the, you know, and I always know that I can 
[03:15:30]  hang out with him and drink.  But so now that I'm sober and he's still doing what he's doing, when we get together, it's  cool.  But it gives me that feeling of like, well, let's just do a shot.  Sure.  Oh, shit.  I've had to control that.  How's the sober thing working out for you?  It's actually, you know what?  I was sitting in a pub here in New York yesterday and we were eating at the bar and I was just  staring at all the bottles and I have absolutely no interest in drinking.  How long?  How long have you been?  It's been almost four years.  Oh, that's great.  Okay.  Jesus.  Wow.  Fantastic.  Right on.  It's been a good four years too.  A lot of the stuff I've done over the last four years, I would not have been able to 
[03:16:00]  do when I was just, you know, because I couldn't, I had to, everywhere I went, I had to stop  at the bar first.  So it really slowed me down.  We got to ask you about Ronnie James, do you?  I mean, we lost him on Sunday.  One of the nicest, we've said a million times, one of the nicest and most appreciative guys  we've ever had on the show.  Just a great guy.  He was a gem and, you know, people don't say it enough, but he was like the most iconic  heavy metal singer of all time. 
[03:16:30]  And, and it happened so quickly.  So I'm, I'm still in shock about that.  Isn't it sickening too, that he's not in the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame?  I mean, all the bands he played with him, what he did on his own.  It's so, and like the mainstream media didn't cover his death.  It was just noise.  The influence of bands, I mean, the way he sang, just that singing style was taken by  so many people that were doing metal.  Yeah, yeah.  Just fantastic.  And he's another one whose voice, I mean, right up to the end was just right there, you 
[03:17:00]  know?  Yeah.  I mean, one minute he, you know, all of a sudden, he's sick.  He's got a stomach cancer, but it's all good.  And then the next thing I hear that he's doing really good, he's going to be back on tour  in a minute.  Yeah, we heard that too.  Two minutes later, all of a sudden, he's on his last leg, and it was like suddenly, you  know, this is it.  Yeah.  Very dramatic 24 hours where he, you know, that whole period where he was back in the  hospital, and he only had a certain amount of time.  It was just really a drag.  I'm really good friends with somebody who's really good friends with him, and so we always 
[03:17:30]  talked about what was going on with Ronnie this whole time.  So it was really sad.  Sucks.  We're running out of time with Slash, unfortunately.  Oh, I wanted to ask you really fast about Steven Adler.  How's he doing?  We had him in about a year ago.  Yeah, Steven, actually, he played on one of the songs on the record.  On the Alice Cooper track.  Okay.  And I told him, I said, if you can get clean, if you can stay clean, then you can play on  the record.  So he did, and he's been doing great.  Right.  You know, so.  Yeah, he was a trip on that rehab show. 
[03:18:00]  I was not obviously in the show, but I was with him the whole time, dealing with him the  whole time.  He was a mess.  That's what happens, man.  When you go down that road, it's a little scary.  You become somebody else, and your whole existence is led by the drug that you're doing.  It's a little gnarly.  So you, him, and Duff are all sober?  Yeah.  That's great, man.  Well, Duff, Steven still smokes pot, and I catch him having a drink. 
[03:18:30]  Well, you know, like, you know, the AA would consider that not sober.  As far as me knowing Steven, that's good enough.  Yeah.  You know.  It's as good as it's going to get.  Compared to what it was, you know, it's an accomplishment, is what Slash is saying.  But yeah, you really did a great job with this, man.  Lyrically, everything is fucking on point, and I was just blown away going through song  after song after song.  All right.  Stop, you're making me uncomfortable.  But I really, no, it's nice, because so many times I've had to lie to people, go, oh,  yeah, that's great, but really, it's shite. 
[03:19:00]  It's so nice to tell the truth.  You're a lousy liar, too.  I really am awful.  Can my eyes bug out and my hands do this?  He's got some tells.  All right, let's get Slash out of here.  So what should we play, Toys?  Oh, yeah.  In your honor, you know, because you brought the Aussie picture, let's do Crucify the Dead.  All right, Crucify the Dead is the Aussie song.  Sure, we'll do that.  Yes.  And it's available now everywhere.  Yeah.  People know how to get to use it.  Anywhere they sell records.  Yeah.  Right.  Which is very...  What the fuck do they sell records?  It's a local record store.  Yeah, Best Buy and Target. 
[03:19:30]  Can you believe it?  And the selection at Best Buy is not that good.  But you can get it online as well.  Yeah, you can download it on iTunes, all that shit.  Slash pleasure, man.  It's good seeing all you guys.  Yeah, it's been a while.  Absolutely.  All right, here we go with the Aussie song.  Talk to you soon.  Absolutely.  The fire started long ago The flames burned out still if it's low 
[03:20:00]  So charred in black There's nothing clear to burn  To burn  We had the same dream Live life to us free  And our dead can chant by a rose 
[03:20:30]  The bones are not around your head Your ego curse you till you bear  You cannot crucify the dead You cannot crucify the dead  To be your dead  Yeah  The future is a setting stone Decisions pass 
[03:21:00] ёzing you alone Betrayed us all with your own selfish greed  Your greed, yeah  You're greed, yeah 
[03:21:30]  Your soldiers now say that your fackered command  Free crucified Yeah, saved by you  Picked by you  The thorns are not around your head  Your ego cuts you too bad  You cannot crucify that game  To be a dead, yeah 
[03:22:00]  We were like brothers with the world in our hands  You always have too much to say  Someday you'll look back and you'll wonder why  You let it all slip away  You let it all slip away  You let it all slip away 
[03:22:30]  You let it all slip away  You let it all slip away  Crucify the dead  Crucify the dead  The bones are large around your head 
[03:23:00]  Your ego cuts you till you bleed  You cannot crucify the dead  To me again  Crucify the dead 
[03:23:30]  From Ozzy Osbourne  Helping out Slash with Slash's solo record there  There you go  That was a good interview with Slash  And we had something nice set up  But what happened, Iraq?  You were negotiating outside the studio  Sam was as well 
[03:24:00]  His handler wasn't really too keen on the idea  Of somebody just coming in  Sort of dressed as Slash  And just surprising him  So they really were taking a lot of precaution around him  Now I want to see if this was a  A good decision on Slash's people  Or a bad decision  Because I want to see exactly what was going to transpire  Well, it's Eastside Dave who's the biggest Guns N' Roses fan  Of course he is  And he was going to barge in during the Slash interview  Dressed as Slash and be Uber fan  And that comes easy to him 
[03:24:30]  Because he really is an Uber fan of Guns N' Roses  Now the thing is  I want to see  Because we've seen him before with Guns N' Roses  People in here  And he goes a little overboard  Sure  So I want to see what he would have done with Slash  And if it would have been a problem  Because Slash is kind of a  Slash is a no-nonsense kind of guy  Like he likes having fun and stuff  But anything like shenanigans or hijinks  Tomfoolery  Tomfoolery 
[03:25:00]  Yes  Instead of having him  His manager wasn't here  So the person handling him also looked like his bodyguard  So when he saw Dave down here in costume  In what?  In his outfit  In his outfit  Costume  Is when he started to raise questions  As to okay  What do you think you're doing?  What is this?  Yeah  Let's bring in his side Dave  And see how this would have worked  And tell him exactly as he would have done it  If Slash was sitting right here right now  Before he comes in 
[03:25:30]  He would like November Rain playing  The guitar solo  It's playing right now  It is playing  Oh my god  Now this is what he would have done  Oh wow  He's up on the console  Wow  This is huge  He's got a Slash doll  He's got a guitar hero guitar  And a Slash doll  And a big hat  But it's  It's like a cat in a hat hat  Why is that threatening? 
[03:26:00]  Dave  What's so scary about this?  I don't know  They were kind of  We told you to look like Slash  You don't look like Slash at all  What are you talking about?  I have a top hat  I have sunglasses  A cigarette  You look like a leprechaun  I have a little Slash doll  I have a little Slash doll  In my left hand  Everyone carries figurines of themselves  And I said  It was his big black bodyguard  Who was like  Ain't no way  Ain't no fucking way  Oh really?  Yeah  He saw you outside  And said no fucking way  I go I'm not going to hurt him  I always make the big mistake 
[03:26:30]  Of reiterating how much  I will not hurt these people  Yeah because that probably  Isn't the first thing on their mind  But then you bring up  You're not going to hurt them  And they're thinking  Oh he wants to hurt them  Because when you guys  Had me meet Duff McKagan  He was very cool with me  Until I said  I'm not going to hurt you  But let's go out drinking  And he got very  Karate defensive  Well no why  He was trying to stay sober  At that point  I didn't know that Jimmy  He just got off  I didn't read the other IMDBs  You know I only read  So Slash  I was very 
[03:27:00]  He did sign my guitar though  Oh he did?  Yes and I  I almost started crying  Did you get a photo with him?  If Love Buzz took it  I would have liked  I did get a photo  A photo  Can I see your guitar?  E-Rock took one  Can I see your guitar?  Oh fuck no  No no no  Absolutely not  Do you want Axl on there?  Absolutely  Here's my idea  I'm going to go for  Izzy Stradlin next  That will be for  The original lineup  And then I'm going to  Make a documentary  Called Finding Axl  Where I go around the country 
[03:27:30]  Trying to get Axl Rose  To finish off the Guitar Hero  Do you know I almost  This is how dumb I am  With Guns N' Roses  Instead of Izzy  I almost asked him  How is Flea?  I'm so glad I didn't  Wow  That's a chilly  You're making faces now  Yeah that would have been bad  I would have felt like  A silly goose  What would you have done  For Slash?  You haven't done anything  Yeah so far  You just pretended to play  I was going to talk  To the man  Person to person  Fan to celebrity  But honestly  I almost  I would have cried  Right  I almost cried 
[03:28:00]  Out in the hallway  Like I'm almost getting emotional  Thinking about it right now  You know  Just because  What does he mean to you?  What doesn't he mean?  Really?  No I'm serious  Like for 32 years  Of my life  I've been a Guns N' Roses fan  And no I'm sorry  I'm 32  See I'm getting flustered  When I start thinking  Of how much he means  Like  Dave Watley  What the fuck are you doing?  He really has tears in his eyes  He does  32 years of my life  I've been on this plant 
[03:28:30]  24 of those  Have been dedicated  To Guns N' Roses  The greatest band  Of all time  To have met Slash  Yes  The man  Behind the riffs  Of Mr. Brownstone  Paradise City  Get in the ring  This is going to take a while  They had a few hits  Welcome to the jungle  Night Train  He forgot  My Michelle  My Michelle  You kind of forgot  Didn't you Dave? 
[03:29:00]  Yeah  Rocket  Patience  Yesterday  Rocket Queen  Yesterday  Yesterday  I used to love her  My world  Had a killer  Had a killer  Make up your mind  Dustin Bones  Dustin Bones  Coma  Sweet child of mine  Bad apples  Locomotive  Running with the devil  Running with the devil  The man behind those riffs  Yeah  It would have been  To have talked to him  Would have been something  Very special  Did you name anything 
[03:29:30]  From the spaghetti incident  I don't know  Since I don't love you  That was spaghetti incident  Yeah  Remember that song  Yeah  They made a video with it  With Gary Oldman  No I don't remember it  You can look that up  On YouTube Daniel  Gary Oldman  How about you sing your favorite  Guns N' Roses song for everybody  I'm a little emotional right now  What is your favorite  I know it was about Slash today  But why don't you just sing  Your favorite Guns N' Roses  I don't know why you have to  Take your clothes off  He has to  He's a rock star  There's no reason for him to take his clothes off 
[03:30:00]  But he has to  There's no reason  I'm flustered  I'm flustered  I'm just fucking that Slash  I am not fucking around  No you guys are just  You don't understand  This is not hurting anybody  By the way  I didn't hurt the man  I wouldn't hurt him  I want to go into Kayla's studio right now  I demand to meet him  Your underpants are still on  I'm not taking them off right now 
[03:30:30]  The song I'd like to sing is  What are you doing?  Because I'm flustered  Because you're flustered  Dave you took your clothes off  I don't know why  But sing your favorite Guns N' Roses song  For everybody  You know Ronnie V is not going to be happy with you  I didn't do anything badly  Oh I know but  No no no  There's a reason why I'm doing this  Axl Rose  You see him running around on stage  With the biker shorts  Well that is true  It's not like I'm doing it for no reason 
[03:31:00]  I have  As you can tell  Biker shorts  I have the same body as Axl Rose  So it works perfectly  Thank you for the compliment  Oof  Oof  Oh that's more of an insult  To Axl  Who me?  No but I  I developed an Audi  Belly button  In the last six months  From what?  Heria  No idea  Probably a hernia  It just happened  Oh no  I didn't have one of these Jim  In like my life  Sweet  You herniated yourself  Yeah  What do you  Did you hear the Slash album 
[03:31:30]  At all?  Did you hear  I just have  Running with the Devil  Stuck in my head  I can't think of anything  Yeah that isn't one  I do have the Slash album  Dr. Alibi  By Lemmy  Was my favorite track  I love that one  Love it man  Yeah that was my favorite track  Did you hear that track  From Japan there?  I heard the Fergie track  I was listening to the show  On my Blackberry  What did you think of Fergie?  I thought she's actually quite good  If you saw her do  Give Me Shelter with the Stones  Last year  You'd know that  Yeah  I didn't  Sorry for being confrontational  No that's okay  I'm flustered  Anthony 
[03:32:00]  You are  You are  I know  You know how much I love you  No I know  I know Mr. D  Okay  Are you jealous  That Fergie got to sing with him  And you didn't?  Well one of the questions  That I had pre-planned was  Can I be in your next video?  That would be  Yeah  And I thought that would be good  Because  No I'm not going to take down  My underpants  I'm dressing like Axel  That's the whole point  So here you go  A little Mr. Brown  No  Go ahead  Let's do a little  Get in the ring for y'all  Alright  Get in the ring  With Eastside Dave 
[03:32:30]  In honor of Slash's visit today  That goes for you  Bob Guccione Jr  Suck my fucking dick  Huh?  You've been ripping off the kids  Earned their hard-earned money  You wanna fuck with me?  Don't fuck with me  I don't like you  I just hate you  I'm gonna kick your ass  Oh yeah  Oh yeah  Yeah 
[03:33:00]  Thank you  Fucking A man  That was  I thought it was Axel  That was pretty good  I thought Axel was right here  He does these  These impersonations  Thank you gentlemen  For at least allowing me  To get slash  He does these impersonations  I swear  You would think it was  The real people  Thank you for letting me  Slash sign my guitar  Wait wait wait  Did you actually say  On Ron and Fez yesterday  That if Axel and Stan 
[03:33:30]  Which is your son  Were drowning in a pool  You would pull out Axel first?  Of course  That's taken out of context  How?  Well I did say that  But  Axel's entertained me  For twenty some odd years  My son  You know  How long  Couple  He's been around  For exactly one year  Yeah one year  Yesterday was his first birthday  Aw happy birthday  I'm not even going  For that shit  No  What I'm saying is  He's got a lot  Of catching up to do 
[03:34:00]  To get W. Axel Rose  A.K.A. Billy Bailey  You have to  You know  He better start singing  Oh he doesn't like  Being called that  He doesn't like  Being called Billy Bailey  No  Why?  Brings back some childhood trauma  You should know that  Dave being the big  Young real name  Billy Bailey  He hates when people  Call him Billy Bailey  I was just informing  The people of what  His real name  William Bailey  Slash his real name  Is Saul Hudson  Yeah I know  Saul Hudson  Now do I get some points  Or what?  A lot of us knew that though 
[03:34:30]  But you didn't know that  He doesn't like  Being called by his real name  Is he?  Yeah  Isward  Isward Stradlin  Isward  Isward  What's Duff's real name?  I don't know  You don't even know  Their real names  The thing is about  G&R  It's different  Is that they're like  A fucking cartoon band  That's why  I would have gotten  Emotional  Slash is not just  A guitarist  He's a fucking  Living walking cartoon  That means so much 
[03:35:00]  Well I don't know  If he wants to be  Called a cartoon  No but you know  What I mean  That's a compliment  It's like the remote  You know there's some  People who go  Transcend life  Like Jesus  Slash  You know those  Type of fucking  People  Slash  You know  Thank you gentlemen  Bye Dave  Can you sing us out?  Sing us out today  Yeah  By the way  Ron and Fez  11 to 3  11 to 3  Oh yeah  Too late for this  Just a little  Just a little patience  Yeah  The awful 
[03:35:30]  The awful fucking  Sopranos tattoo  On his back  You got the picture  Can I see it  I had to take a picture  Because  I've never seen it  It's the worst  And funniest tattoo  I've ever seen  In my entire life  It really is  Dave had to get  A tattoo  Of the Sopranos  On his back  And I don't know  Who did this  Who are those people  So bad  It's the worst tattoo ever  Is that on those  Tattoo sites?  It better be  If it's not  I'm submitting it  Immediately  Submit it to  Bad tattoo sites 
[03:36:00]  I mean  Look at their faces  They all  Legitimately look  Retarded  Eyes like Bill Cosby  Like one is smaller  Than the other  You would never know  That's the Sopranos  At all  And the best  Is the quotation  On the bottom  Which is  I ordered  For the table  I know  He's actually  Going around  With that  Permanently  On his back  Dave is hysterical  When I drive home  I listen to the show  And Dave  Fucking kills me  He is really  God damn funny  Is the company  Paying him yet? 
[03:36:30]  Probably not  Not what he's worth  That's for sure  That guy's  A couple of  Chicken sticks  Short of a picnic  That's right  Chip  Did you see  Ronnie B's got a quote  In Jay Moore's book?  Really?  In the beginning?  Yeah  No we don't  I'm like  How much does it take  To  When people ask me  How much does it take  To raise a kid  I say everything  Or something like that  Is that a very good  Ronnie B quote?  It's a very good  Ronnie B quote  Yeah 
[03:37:00]  Does it say Ronnie B?  Oh yeah  It says Ron Bennington  Oh good  Yeah it's very good  The book is really good  Jay Moore's book  And what  Did Jay's show get cancelled?  Yeah  Gary Moore  How long was it on for?

[03:37:30]  The book  You should pick up his book  It's very good  I was reading some  Excerpts from it  I was able to take a sample  And read it on my iPad  Last night  So I was leafing through it  With my iPad  Well the iPad is going to become  The quiz essential reader I think  That was where I almost lost it  I couldn't look at Jimmy  I couldn't look at Jimmy  Do you feel me looking at him?  I felt your eyes burning through me  And I had to turn my head 
[03:38:00]  And look down  Because we're so quick  To jump on anyone  That says the wrong word here  Yeah  And Slash said quiz essential  I thought it was a good word  And I went to look at Jimmy  And saw he was staring at me  And laughing  So I had to turn away  Lest I be laughing  I just couldn't  I couldn't say forgy  Because I was going to laugh  I only got one out  Forgy  But I kept  I really was fighting the earth  To laugh out loud 
[03:38:30]  I had to finally just say  Forgy later  Forgy  Ah shit in a handbag  Wow  Let's go home  Jimmy's just farting like crazy  Yeah I got  I got trainer at noon today  So I gotta get  I got selfie  I got selfie at 11.45  Oh  How's that going for you?  It's good  I'm healthy  I'm very healthy  I'm a healthy boy  Let's see  Pool is fucking  Pool's got water in it 
[03:39:00]  They fix it yet?  Clean it?  It's all  It's getting clean today  And then I crank  Both fucking heaters on  Wait why wouldn't they  Clean it before  They put the water in it?  It's easier to clean  With the water in  Tell you the truth  How?  Well and I have  Such a good cover  That there was  Nothing in there really  Just some leaves  At the deep end  And shit  And then I have  The filter going  And everything  And now they just  Come and vacuum up  What's on the bottom?  The discoloration  Oh they're gonna  I'm gonna have the  Whole pool  Re-surfaced  After this season  I've been hearing that 
[03:39:30]  For a lot of years  No but it's a new  Type of  Not new  But it's a different  Type of thing  It's not gunite  I can't remember  The name of it  But it's good shit  Is it the same company  You're gonna do it?  It comes out like  No!  I'll tell you one thing  Fuck Modern Comfort  That cock  Fucking hate them  What's Modern Comfort?  That was a pool company  I used  Do you feel like  They gave you  Modern Comfort?  No  I feel like they gave me  A discolored  Fucking gunite pool  They just wouldn't 
[03:40:00]  Take care of it?  No  It's like  Don't try to tell me  That's how it's  Supposed to fucking look  I've looked at pools  They look all nice  And uniform in color  And the marble dust coating  Is nice and sparkly  And cool  This thing's all  Blotchy and fucking  Like shite  Why wouldn't they  Just redo it for you?  Because fucking people  Are dickheads  What was his excuse?  Fuck bags  Bruce  Suck it  What was his excuse?  No excuse  In order to get an excuse 
[03:40:30]  You'd have to actually  Get him on the phone  Oh you couldn't get him?  Nah no  After a while  You wouldn't hear from him  No more  And Keith  He just fucking  Keith does what Keith  Can do  He hounded him  And pounded him  And everything  But unless I want to  Hire a fucking lawyer  And go after the guy  You should  And I'm pretty sick  Of litigation  To tell you the truth  I am so sick  Of litigating  It's usually against me  But even  Something like this  I don't want to  What do I want to  Spend my time  In a courtroom  Getting deposed  And doing all kinds of shit 
[03:41:00]  It won't make it that far  You know what I'll do  I say fuck it  I get some other guy  That knows what he's doing  He's going to resurface  The entire inside of the pool  With some new stuff  It's like  They use this diamond  Grinding thing  And make  It gets  It's smooth  Like fucking granite  Like a granite  Fucking table  The whole inside of the pool  It's amazing  So I'm having that done  And  Yeah it's thermite paint  It's called  And yes  It's very expensive  But you know what  You get what you pay for 
[03:41:30]  20  Wow  Yeah it's crazy  It'll take me quite a few hours  Of blackjack  I think you should  To lose that  I think you should  Sue the guy  Yeah  Absolutely  For that money  But then you know  It costs  To get a retainer  For a lawyer  And then you go after  And then legal costs  By the time you're done  I could have just  Had it fixed  You know I'd love  To teach the guy  A fucking lesson  Give him a little  How do you do  You didn't fuck me over  But you know  I fucking  I'm going to sue you  But after a while  It doesn't become 
[03:42:00]  Monetarily sound  You know what I mean  I agree  But just get a lawyer  That's not that expensive  And you might be able  To get him to settle  Yeah  Because you're in the right  You don't get  Yeah terrazzo  That's what it's called  A terrazzo finish  It's fucking beautiful  Why are you yelling  Because I'm just angry  At this guy  I'm so angry at him  Was it his company  Yeah  But then I heard  It's like  The guy that came over 
[03:42:30]  That knows Keith  That is going to do  This terrazzo  For the pool  At the end of the season  He said  Keith goes  Well come over  And see the  You know  Take a look at what  They did to the pool  He goes  Oh I know  He goes  Everyone knows  About that pool  Like oh great  I have the celebrity  Fucking shit pool  I have the pool  That every pool guy  Knows about  As being the shitty  Fucking pool  It's amazing  That guy wouldn't fix it  What is your  I don't even think he could  It looks okay  When there's water in it 
[03:43:00]  And you know  The filter and the  Waterfalls going  Because you can't  Really get a good  Beat on the  On the walls  And stuff  Yeah  But when  When the pool  Is low level  Like on the off season  You could just see  It's fucking  The guy that did  The gunite  And then sprayed on  The marble dust  And shit like that  Just did this  Horrible job  Where some spots  Are really white  Others are grey  It's all blotchy  And then it's got  This crinkle  Almost crackle  Pattern  Over the whole 
[03:43:30]  Bottom surface  That's not supposed  To be there  It's not cracks  But it's like  A crackly pattern  Because they did it  In the heat  And the sun  Was being  Like they did it  They fucked it up  So  I'll get it  Taken care of  In the meantime  I'm just gonna have to  You know  Deal with it  When's your pool opening  They're there right now  Doing the chemicals  So  Hopefully by  The weekend  I'll have it  Fucking blast in heat  Yeah  I accept  You're 
[03:44:00]  Cordially  Alright let's  Get out of here  What </pre>
