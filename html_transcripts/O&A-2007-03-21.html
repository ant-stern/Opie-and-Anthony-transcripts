<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show opened chaotically, with unexplained sounds of distress and a likely fart joke.  The main segment, "Whip Them Out Wednesday," encouraged female listeners to flash people displaying "WOW" stickers on their cars, with the hosts discussing varying levels of support from different radio stations.  The show was plagued by technical difficulties, including computer and studio connection issues, forcing a mid-show relocation.  Persistent problems with their PalTalk feed and other technical glitches were frequently mentioned.

A substantial portion focused on American Idol contestant Sanjaya Malakar's unexpected success, despite poor performances, leading to speculation about vote rigging. A caller mentioned another station’s "Flash Friday" imitation of "Whip Them Out Wednesday". Howard Stern's comments on Sanjaya were also discussed.  Other topics included Heather Mills, a caller's story of punching a "lot lizard," and a listener-suggested title for James Norton's book detailing his experiences with prostitution.  A YouTube video of "Todd the Beavis Kid" performing acapella heavy metal was showcased, and the hosts critiqued listener submissions for their MacBook Karaoke contest.

Opie discussed a cover shoot and his planned healthy diet.  A caller, Trent from Canada, described an uninhibited sexual encounter.  Daniel from Jersey won the MacBook Karaoke contest singing Meat Loaf's "I'd Do Anything for Love," comically including the female parts.  The lack of consolation prizes, unlike Ron and Fez's "big ass prize closet," was jokingly addressed, with *Taxi* DVDs suggested as runner-up prizes.  The show’s tour dates were announced.  A discussion followed about Jimmy's pungent bathroom experience, and Anthony promoted the dating website "hotenough.org," sparking a debate about its fairness.  The hosts considered submitting their photos.

A list of the top ten gayest animals was discussed, with graphic descriptions of homosexual behavior in various species, including bonobos, Japanese macaques, gray whales, cob antelope, American bison, walruses, cock-of-the-rock birds, giraffes, bottlenose dolphins, and black swans. A caller, John from Jersey, jokingly mentioned his divorce from a woman he described as a bison. Another caller, Sean from Illinois, shared a story about his female dog's same-sex encounters.

The hosts criticized Steve Harvey's radio show, playing and mocking clips they considered racist and unfunny, referencing a recent AP article. Listener calls offered differing opinions on both Steve Harvey and Opie and Anthony's humor.  A caller, Troy from Brooklyn, defended Steve Harvey while simultaneously enjoying Opie and Anthony's show, despite finding it unfunny.  The show concluded with mentions of upcoming guests Mick Foley and Jimmy Norton.

Mick Foley joined the show to discuss his autobiography, "Hardcore Diaries," recounting humorous and bizarre WWE experiences, including kissing Vince McMahon's bare buttocks.  He discussed McMahon's unpredictable behavior, the XFL, his children's reactions to his wrestling career, and a funny encounter with Adam West.  The conversation included sexually explicit jokes and references; a caller mentioned naming his dog "Mick."  The show featured listener calls, discussions about other celebrities, and a heated argument audio clip between Lily Tomlin and a director.  A major announcement from Foley following WrestleMania, involving Vince McMahon, was teased.

A listener-submitted sexually explicit audio clip was played, followed by discussion of a behind-the-scenes meltdown on the set of *I Heart Huckabees* involving Lily Tomlin and the director, featuring the director repeatedly calling Tomlin a "cunt."  The hosts speculated on the reasons for the outburst.  More listener audio was played, including a disastrous "MacBook Karaoke" entry and another heated argument.  Heather Mills' appearance on Larry King and the betting odds on her prosthetic leg coming off on *Dancing with the Stars* were discussed.  Big A was comically interrogated about his surprisingly unhealthy diet, with the hosts repeatedly joking about his weight.  Upcoming gigs, including a show with Otto and George, and comedic banter, including impressions by Twitchell (Cowardly Lion from *The Wizard of Oz* and a controversial impression of a straight man with Tourette's), were discussed.


Twitchell, a comedian, guested, starting with a caller's Superman impression request and an anecdote about a friend nicknamed "Clark Cunt."  Twitchell performed his Cowardly Lion impression repeatedly.  Two female listeners, Carly and Sam, were brought in, engaging in conversation with sexually suggestive remarks and questions about their dating lives. Twitchell attempted to ask one of them out, unsuccessfully.  The conversation continued with crude humor and banter, including discussions of physical attributes, farts, and speculation about sexual orientation.  The segment concluded with the "Line of the Day" and final plugs.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  It's the Opie and Anthony show on XM202 featuring Opie, Anthony, and James Norton.  As daylight breaks, creeping through the shadows, an unstoppable force lays in wait, ready to strike.  Oh my god!  Oh Jesus, Jimmy!  I can see you.  I think you're not scared.  Oh, God!  Holy mother of God! 
[00:00:30]  Oh boy, please don't!  God damn it!  What?  I always think so mad.  Oh my god.  This is killing me.  You're killing me.  Uh-oh.  Just fart so we can start the bit.  Oh my god!  That's a shame!  You gotta stand here!  Shut up!  Shut up!  Shut up!  Shut up!  Shut up!  I'm stumped because I'm a shapely European blonde. 
[00:01:00]  Anthony.  Jesus, we are just hoarse.  James Norton.  Look at this face.  How do you not love it and want to kiss it?  You rock.  Sex Bagel here on the radio with you.  Sex Bagel.  It's the O.P. and Anthony show.  And Sex Bagel gets hit with poker chips.  But enough of this palaver. 
[00:01:30]  Let's get the show on the road.  This is what it sounds like when doves cry.  Is that what it sounds like, really?  Is that it? 
[00:02:00]  Is that a dove weeping?  Try it at home.  It's fun.  Very interactive radio show.  We will get this stuck in your head today.  Gentlemen.  Good morning.  Welcome to the O.P. and Anthony show.  It's Wednesday.  Wow.  Time for the only thing we do on our radio show. 
[00:02:30]  That's right.  Whip them out Wednesday.  Whip them out Wednesday.  Whip them out.  Hello, ladies.  Whip them out.  Good morning, ladies.  Time to powder up your boobs for Whip Them Out Wednesday.  Did they powder them?  They should buff them up and get them ready for the ride into work today.  That's like the 1940s.  Wow.  Let me powder up my boobs.  Yeah.  With those big green silo pointy bras.  I suggest a lot of lotion.  Lotion.  Whip them up.  That's good.  Get them all nice. 
[00:03:00]  That way they don't chafe in the cold breeze, too.  Yeah, get rid of all that dry skin.  Yeah, you don't want dry skin and chafing.  And then get a buffer.  Buff them.  Buff them up a bit.  Make them look all nice.  And just maybe a little powder.  And then when you see a wow on someone's car, you flop those babies out the window.  And the guy driving or the gal with the wow sticker on or whatever other kind of wow they put on their vehicle. 
[00:03:30]  A lot of times it's truckers.  They like writing it in the dirt on the back of their truck.  They look and go, what the hell?  Look at this.  I'm getting a show.  Why?  Oh, that's right.  It's Whip them out Wednesday.  That's right.  My sticker is working.  And look, some of you guys listen to us on a radio station that is very, very, very lazy.  Oh.  And they don't want to do any of the heavy lifting.  Lazy, shiftless.  They pretty much, what they do is they just turn on a switch and all of a sudden the Opie and Anthony show pops on their radio station. 
[00:04:00]  They don't want to get involved with wow stickers and all that crap.  Oh.  That means doing some work.  That's trouble.  But that shouldn't stop you.  You should just get a homemade wow sign.  That's all.  And call your local radio station and say, hey.  What are you doing?  Are you guys giving out the Opie and Anthony wow stickers?  And if they say no, go, well, then you're just plain stupid.  What's wrong with you?  What's wrong with you?  And then you go to like an art supply store and make your own wow sign. 
[00:04:30]  Make your own.  Because this does happen out there.  There's women flashing every single day, especially on Wednesdays.  Yeah.  Hence Whip them out Wednesday.  So that's how we start today's show.  Welcoming everyone to Whip them out Wednesday.  What's going on, little Jimmy?  I heard a show.  Is this show still being edited in San Francisco?  Oh, I don't even know.  I assume.  Every time we say something, I'm wondering where it's being edited.  I assume.  We have editors at every radio station, even though Al down the hall does a great job for us. 
[00:05:00]  Then they got other guys that are panicky Pete's and they just start dumping out like crazy  because they might not know all the rules.  I'll slap an injunction on them so fast it'll make their heads spin.  Al knows it.  Right, Al?  Look, you know, the radio stations that take us seriously and are motivated and pushing the show  and doing the right thing, they're showing some fine ratings.  Yeah.  You know, you look at Buffalo, Chicago. 
[00:05:30]  You know, you hear the stories from these cities where they just push the show and they promote the show  and they get the WOW stickers out there.  Right.  And they got other shows on the station kind of talking about the Opie and Anthony show.  Doing very, very well.  And then other stations, they just, you know, they just flip the switch.  Flip the switch.  Where's the feed?  They don't even say the show.  Right.  They're like, where's the morning feed?  Are we ready for the morning feed?  We're just the morning feed.  Who is it? 
[00:06:00]  I don't know.  Just hit the switch.  Who cares?  We were forced to take this show.  I know you're out there.  There's a few program directors going, oh, God, he's talking about me.  That's me.  What do you mean we have to carry them?  Who?  What?  We don't, oh.  And then behind closed doors to, like, other people are like, oh, we're being forced to carry the Opie and Anthony show by corporates.  So we just turn it on.  But we're not going to support.  We just turn it on.  We don't support them. 
[00:06:30]  We don't acknowledge them.  We don't have WOW stickers.  We can't wait for 9 o'clock to come so we can get back to our stupid music.  Yeah.  Playing all the hits.  Oh, we know they're out there.  And then there's other PDs we're in constant contact with and they're loving the show.  So that's just how it works, Jimmy.  So if San Francisco is editing the show, whatever.  Whatever.  You know, we can't control everybody.  We know this show will be very successful in a lot of cities.  It just bothers me. 
[00:07:00]  Let me just type F-U-I-N-G-computer-bull-S-T-E-R.  Sorry.  Sorry.  Again, pal talk isn't working.  Again.  This is, amazingly, both places.  Both here and at XM.  Yeah.  I cannot get a computer thing to work. 
[00:07:30]  They can't get audio or video feed from in here.  No one's able to watch.  This freezes up every two seconds.  Well, we've got to get it fixed because it's a distraction to Anthony.  It's very distracting because I get – you know how you get instant feedback over there?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  I don't have an instant feedback screen.  Like you've kind of taken over the instant feedback thing.  Yeah.  But I get a lot of information from the pal talk screen.  You know, lines and the opinions that people have.  And they look around the studio and comment on things that are happening. 
[00:08:00]  So, you know, I like to comment on that.  And it took it completely out of the mix.  So now I sit here and look at, like, a logo on a screensaver or a desktop logo.  And, you know, that's what I do.  So, whatever.  What can I tell you?  I don't know what it is.  For days, weeks, I've been asking.  And before the show, when we're doing our show prep, you know when we get yelled at sometimes?  My computer in there has not been working.  I can't get online. 
[00:08:30]  It takes ten minutes for me to check something as graphically intensive as my email.  I know some of those fonts are a little rough for the processor to handle.  Well, you brought that up weeks ago as well.  Just weeks go by.  We just need everything fixed.  Just fix everything.  Yeah.  Come in, fix everything.  Just fix everything.  This is quite the challenge.  Yeah.  It really is.  We can't have broken equipment.  We got two different studios.  We do a walk to another studio because both companies refuse to give in. 
[00:09:00]  So, we're the ones that have to suffer.  And we have to move every day mid-show.  What other radio show moves mid-show?  None.  No other show.  They didn't take us into consideration.  It was two companies saying, no, we're bigger than you.  No, we're bigger than you.  No, we're bigger than you.  We want our whores where we can see them.  Right.  That's what they're saying.  In the end, we suffer.  So, in the middle of our radio show, we have to pack up all this crap. 
[00:09:30]  This thing has come to the point where we're just surrounded by a ton of crap every morning.  Yeah, you see like interns carrying big bins of stuff.  It's like a pit crew.  It's a NASCAR pit crew that comes in around 845 and just starts cleaning everything up.  And then we have to leave and walk and then continue our show somewhere else.  How stupid is this?  That is silly.  Silly.  But neither company would give in.  Neither company would give in. 
[00:10:00]  So, we have to suffer.  So, all we ask if we're going to do the show from two different studios every morning,  that everything works on both sides.  It just makes it a little easier for us because we're doing all the heavy lifting.  Yeah.  You guys just have to take the feed.  Just take the feed.  What's the name of the show?  The Feed.  We got the feed in the morning.  The feed every morning.  Rock music all afternoon.  And when they're done.  Yeah.  When that distraction's over. 
[00:10:30]  We get to do what we really want to do.  Is make believe the music still counts.  The feed in the mornings with what's their names.  We know who you are.  It's okay.  We understand.  It's all right.  We get it.  We get it.  It's okay.  You were forced to take us.  We'll try to get along.  It's an arranged marriage.  Yeah.  We're standing there crying.  At the altar. 
[00:11:00]  The arranged marriage.  The poor girl sitting there crying.  That's us.  Our phone number 1-866-313-FREE.  So hopefully Pal Talk will be working in a few minutes here.  I don't care.  You know something?  I could see Marissa's cam.  Isn't that all that really matters in the morning?  Well, why don't you explain Marissa to the rest of America?  Marissa gets ready for work every morning, and she takes a shower and comes out and then  gets dressed.  Yeah.  And she doesn't hide anything.  No.  She's not one of these.  It's a good egg. 
[00:11:30]  She's not one of these girls on Pal Talk that just teases you all morning.  It's not prude talk, my friends.  It's Pal Talk.  Be a pal and take your clothes off.  There you go.  Thank you.  Let's say hi to Brian in Allentown.  Brian, what's up?  Yeah, I heard, I was listening to 97.5, and I heard them ripping off the wow bit.  They're doing flashing Fridays or something like that?  Yeah, it was flash Friday.  I heard a caller call in, said they saw someone flash, and they're like, oh, it's a flash  of Friday alert. 
[00:12:00]  Flash Friday.  Yeah.  Flash Friday.  Stupid Lyca's ripped off or whip him out Wednesday a bit, but I guess he was sort of smart enough  to try to change it around a little bit.  Yeah.  But, and then other radio stations have now taken that lead, and they do it on Fridays.  I mean, you know, the whip him out Wednesday thing is an original.  We got articles dating back to, I don't know, like 96, something like that, easily 10, 10  years ago.  All right, thank you, Brian.  I don't know what to tell you about that.  It just sucks.  The business is filled with leeches that just, like, troll websites and steal bits from other 
[00:12:30]  radio shows.  That's what we have to deal with.  And they get away with it.  This is no, like, radio police.  We should start the radio police.  Yeah.  All right, Brian.  Thank you.  What's with Imus this morning?  He isn't wearing his cowboy hat.  I think he's going for the Sanjaya look.  Got the long hair looking like Sanjaya.  He's popular on Idol, so I figured, yeah, yeah, what the hell, let me get rid of my cowboy 
[00:13:00]  hat.  What do you think of Sanjaya there, Imus?  You get those feelings?  He's cute.  Yeah, you get those feelings, right?  Yeah.  I'd like to take him down to the ranch and ride him like a horse.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Oh, shut up, stupid.  Jerk.  Idiot.  Yeah, yeah, Sanjaya hair, all right.  Sanjaya.  Me, Sanjaya.  If Sanjaya was a corpse.  I'd like to have him on the back of my horse, maybe put his hands around me. 
[00:13:30]  I'll use that old gag.  Hey, there's a handle up front.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Stupid.  Jerk.  He's got the Sanjaya do.  Speaking of...  He's got a perm tomorrow.  Imagine.  Curly top.  Mop top, Imus.  Speaking of Sanjaya, front page of the entertainment section of today's paper in New York, just  in huge letters, it says, America, vote him off. 
[00:14:00]  Wow.  You know, people have had it.  Well, Sanjaya will not be voted off Idol tonight.  There's no way in the world.  No, I think he was put over last night by that little crying girl in the audience.  Yeah, if you haven't seen Idol yet, Sanjaya comes out.  What does he sing?  You Really Got Me?  Yeah.  The easiest song you could sing, by the way.  I could even sing You Really Got Me and make it sound good.  And I suck.  You go to any karaoke, anyone can get up and sing that and sound halfway decent. 
[00:14:30]  He was horrid.  He really was horrid.  I'm not even attracted to him anymore.  His teeth are too big.  Are they?  I think Patrice convinced me for like two days that he was something to kind of fawn over.  Fawn.  Now I look at him, I'm like, he's too toothy.  Now you're criticizing him.  You're critical.  Yeah, you're critical like you would criticize a girl that's perfect.  You know, like the big smile.  Yeah.  Too toothy for me.  Too toothy.  But Sanjaya comes out, he sings You Really Got Me.  And then they show a picture or whatever. 
[00:15:00]  They go to the audience.  And there's a girl losing her mind, crying like she's seen the Beatles.  And they're doing 60 songs yesterday, last night, whatever.  So stupid me, I'm thinking they did a flashback and maybe just had a little fun with it and  decided to show like real footage of the Beatles performing, even though it was in color,  I know.  Yeah.  Maybe they colorized it.  I don't know.  Go with it.  I didn't think it was actually someone that would be that just, you know, into Sanjaya.  Emotional. 
[00:15:30]  Yeah, emotional.  And she was just losing her mind and her hands were up in the air and she's crying as he's  singing.  I'm like, what is going on?  And she was like all of but 10 years old.  And then at the end, Sanjaya had to hug her and, you know, he wasn't into that.  He was like, ew.  At least she doesn't have any of those pesky boobies to get in the way.  Ew.  Yeah, he's hugging her.  Look at those old Beatles, the old Beatles footage, though, and see those girls screaming  and realize like they were, you know, 12 and 13 years old. 
[00:16:00]  They look like they're 40.  Right.  The hell was going on back then?  Those stupid glasses.  I don't know.  Ridiculous hairdos.  They all look like the ugly chicks in The Godfather when Fontaine was singing.  Yeah.  Well, here's a taste, in case you missed it, of Sanjaya.  This is like bad karaoke, you're right.  You got me so I don't know what I'm doing.  I think it misses every note. 
[00:16:30]  Girl, you really got me now.  You got me so I hit you that night.  Girl, you really got me now.  You got me so I don't know what I'm doing.  Oh, yeah.  You really got me now.  You got me so I hit you that night.  Uh-huh.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Don't ever send me. 
[00:17:00]  I only want to be by your side.  Here we go.  Girl, you really got me now.  You got me so I hit you that night.  Oh, yeah.  You really got me now.  You got me so I don't know what I'm doing.  Oh, yeah.  You really got me now.  You got me so I hit you that night.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  All right.  It's so bad.  That's all you get today. 
[00:17:30]  This is what it sounds like when doves cry.  That's it.  So that was Sanjaya.  Like, it just got awful.  But he's going to make it through again.  Yeah.  And if he makes it through tonight, elimination, then he goes on tour because the top ten go on tour across America.  And the American Idol people, because I'm convinced in the end it's American Idol that really controls the votes for the most part. 
[00:18:00]  Conspiracy?  Oh, yeah.  They want Sanjaya to tour this summer.  He's so popular.  They need him on tour.  Yeah.  So he's going to make it.  There's no doubt in my mind.  I'll bet $1,000 right now.  We're going to take the bet.  $1,000 Sanjaya makes it tonight.  Well, they have probably a thing like Last Comic Standing had this thing where people vote, but I guarantee you there's a little asterisk where it says it's only the producers have the final word.  I mean, I guarantee.  You think? 
[00:18:30]  Yeah, of course.  Because it's always – that's never been presented.  They've always said that it is completely up to the American public.  Do you read all that stuff that goes by the screen real fast at the end of Idol?  There's something in there.  Yeah.  Reading?  That's what I mean.  There's something in there.  What do we say here?  Look, we don't even vote for the President of the United States.  Readings for queers.  Exactly.  Not if you're a speed reader, though.  Oh.  If you're a speed reader, then it's not gay.  Then it's cool.  Because you're getting it over with as fast as possible.  Yeah.  Then you get back to the cool stuff.  Yeah.  You're not really committing to anything if you're speed reading. 
[00:19:00]  Pictures.  Yeah.  I like pretending I'm a speed reading.  I just leaf through things.  This stinks.  Leaf.  Just leaf through it.  I'm skimming.  Hey, we got to deal with this early.  Oh, no.  John in Jersey, what?  Hey.  Johnny, boy, is this going to be negative?  No, no, no.  Welcome aboard.  All right, Johnny.  Good morning to you.  I just want to know, I want to know how can someone who's got like a rock star job, make  good money, you know, you get to sit there and you look a little pretty with your hair. 
[00:19:30]  What are you bitching about?  Pretty?  Pretty?  Who looks pretty?  There is no prettiness going on here, sir.  Who looks pretty with their hair?  Stop and just take it in the butt, pretty boy.  Who looks pretty?  Who looks pretty, you idiot?  Who looks pretty?  I vote for hope.  Who looks pretty?  John, who do you think looks pretty?  Come on, John.  John, you said it.  Come on, John.  Who looks pretty in here?  Is it E-Rock or Jimmy?  Who are you gay for, John?  Who are you gay for?  Who do you like?  You faggot.  Who's sexually frustrating you that you had a call? 
[00:20:00]  Who's the pretty one?  John, who's pretty?  Come on.  Come on, say it.  Come on, who's pretty?  Say it, John.  Who's pretty?  Come on, who's pretty?  I want to hear my name.  Who's pretty?  Tell OBE he's pretty.  Come on, John.  Who's pretty?  Who's pretty?  All right.  OBE's pretty.  He said it.  It's great.  Another call that makes me feel fat.  You're looking much better, Jimmy.  Someday we'll be the pretty ones. 
[00:20:30]  A couple of wallflowers.  I know.  Open the wallflowers.  I seem to get under people's skin.  Because I wasn't even the one bitching this morning.  I was bummed about alcohol.  Of course.  So I was just going off on a little rant.  I wasn't yelling or screaming.  I was just telling both companies they need to fix our stuff so they can make our job easier.  That's all.  That's all.  I'll be the first to admit that I absolutely have the greatest job.  Yeah.  And I love what we do.  But we also are very competitive and we want things to work around us. 
[00:21:00]  And it's also, I've noticed, it's usually when you come into the job, whatever job it is,  when you first get in in the morning, that's when you notice what's working and what's not working.  So that's pretty much when we say, you know, oh, this isn't working or there's a problem with this.  It's because you're just walking in.  You're not going to do it like an hour, two hours later.  Right.  Oh, by the way, that was broken for an hour.  You get it over with right away.  And, you know, sorry.  And then on to the fun, fun, fun.  Sorry we show passion for what we do.  Sorry about that.  Yeah, we could call it in like most radio jocks in America and go, ah, half the stuff's broken, whatever. 
[00:21:30]  I don't care about this job anyway, so I'll just sit here and not say anything.  Well, just phone it in if the phones weren't broken.  No, pal talk's important to us.  The instant feedback is important to us.  The computers in the office are important to us as we try to, you know, find the best stuff to talk about this morning.  Yeah.  So if that stuff's not working, of course we're going to mention it.  We've done it our whole careers.  This is what they had to say about Sanjaya last night.  I got to tell you, you shocked me tonight. 
[00:22:00]  You know, usually you're just kind of reserved, kind of like just mildly mean, kind of like cool, very cool guy.  Dude, you came out of your shell tonight.  Yeah.  I think that was your best performance today.  At least you came out of the shell.  I'm still like, I'm in shock all of a while.  That's what we've been waiting for.  Well, at least we've been waiting for.  The nuisance job.  You know what?  Go for it.  Go for it.  You went for it.  It was a lot of fun to see you like this.  I hope you had fun up there. 
[00:22:30]  I did.  By the way, Paula was effed up last night.  I was making any sense.  I think the little girl's face says it all.  Referring to the girl just losing her mind.  Just crying.  Simon just is like, whatever.  America's going to do what they do.  Or the people behind the show.  Something's going on.  Well, who do you think is second?  Like, who's going to be standing there up there with him?  This is where we get into the...  This is where we get into the who cares area of American Idol discussion. 
[00:23:00]  I don't even...  I don't know.  I only know one other contestant's name.  Melinda Doolittle.  Doolittle.  She's going to win the whole thing.  Doolittle.  This whole show is a waste of time because she's going to win the whole thing.  She is so much better than everybody else.  Yeah.  And the rest of them, I couldn't even tell you their names.  That's her name?  The girl who's really good?  Melinda Doolittle?  Yeah, she is.  Doolittle.  She's got a star's name.  She has an awful body.  She's like 29, but she looks 45.  She has no neck.  She's named after E-Rock Doolittle. 
[00:23:30]  The Doolittles.  Actually, should we do nothing?  Oh, damn.  Oh, we were tied on that one.  I tried to clever it up with Eric first.  I should have just went for do nothing.  It's a race.  Let's say hi to Tony the Trucker.  Tony.  What's going on?  Hey, man.  Hey, you guys got to realize the reason why this kid's son of a kid keeps getting moved on  is because his votes are being outsourced, man.  His votes are probably coming from India.  Oh, his votes are being outsourced.  That was a great line that got crapped out because your phone decided at that moment 
[00:24:00]  to cut out the best word of the line.  Yeah, very good.  I also heard that Howard is trying to claim responsibility for Sanjaya still being on the  show.  Don't you have to have a popular radio show to be able to get something like that done?  How many millions of votes do they get each time?  Over 30 million votes.  Yeah.  Over 30 million votes a week.  30 million votes.  And he's not even talking to a million people. 
[00:24:30]  And then if you take that million people, how many people would actually vote if he told  them to?  Yeah.  Just another delusional statement from Howard Stern.  There are websites that have been dedicated to voting for the worst American idol since  the competition began a few years ago.  So everyone kind of groups around the worst person and sees how far they could get him.  Plus the fact the guy just has popularity.  He was featured so much during the auditions and stuff.  He goes a long way. 
[00:25:00]  It goes a long way, yeah.  It helps that he doesn't have actual talent.  But to claim that it's you that is keeping him on the show is completely ridiculous.  He doesn't have talent, but that one video of him doing that hula hoop thing, you got  to admire it.  The hula dance.  The kid can hula.  He can hula for whatever that's worth.  A lot.  And finally, Sanjaya gives the fan and the audience that just went nuts like she was  seeing the Beatles a hug.  I actually think she liked him. 
[00:25:30]  Really?  Yeah.  That was good, right?  You enjoyed that.  You're a fan.  Yeah.  Say hello to this young lady.  What is your name?  Ashley.  Ashley Sanjaya.  Sanjaya.  Ashley.  Oh.  Oh.  Are you having fun, sweetheart?  Yeah?  Okay.  Just checking.  If you need anything, let us know, okay?  We'll be right here.  Is that Ryan?  Yeah, yeah.  He's actually asking Sanjaya. 
[00:26:00]  Yeah, there's something going on with him, too.  But there you go.  Sanjaya.  We'll make it through.  Again.  We'll have to call Patrice to see what he thought of Sanjaya's performance.  Maybe Patrice is getting tired of him, too.  No, Patrice is voting for him.  I haven't seen that fat sissy in about three weeks.  That sissy.  Yeah, we got to talk about Heather Mills after the break. 
[00:26:30]  You want to talk about creepy.  I'm amazed.  I finally saw her dance.  They had a clip on The Insider last night.  We'll get into it next.  Like you just said, coming into the studio, I'm starting to think she has two legs.  Yeah, I think she's lying about losing a leg.  I think it was a clever roof.  We'll discuss that and other things in just a bit.  It's Opie and Anthony.  And little Jimmy Norton, who's going to be where?  I'm going to Rhode Island tonight, and then it's August tomorrow and Boston for the weekend.  I'm scared.  You're on the road.

[00:28:30]  the ona virus spreading across america our phone number 1-866-313-free did you see this grand  canyon thing what happened jimmy what happened what happened there you are there you are  either the horseshoe thing that's coming out yeah yeah i guess it has a glass bottom yeah it's like  a glass floor it's like a horseshoe and it juts out over the rim of the grand canyon uh and it's a  sheer drop of 4 000 feet so you get to walk out on this thing and look down through the glass uh floor 
[00:29:00]  and it's like you're kind of just floating over uh the grand canyon with with special slipper shoes  yeah i mean uh brought up i saw the news it's almost like booties little space booties so you  can't scratch up the glass when you walk out so you don't screw up the view of her but man they had  something like that at the cn uh the cn tower in uh toronto yeah horrifying really horrifying and i've  been in a uh in a helicopter over the grand canyon so it's i'm all right with heights but when you're 
[00:29:30]  like standing on like just a glass plate and you can see all the way down to the ground it's just  horrifying yeah like your brain can't under just doesn't understand what's going on you know you're  safe because they wouldn't like uh put you in a weird situation in the cn tower would they you know  you're way way up in the air and there's this there's this uh just this square of glass that  you stand in the middle of everyone takes turns and you look down and it's just flat out horrifying  you find yourself kind of tiptoeing across the thing because your brain can't understand what's going 
[00:30:00]  on to do that over the grand canyon and walk where it's all glass underneath your feet yeah  around a horseshoe four thousand feet up that's gonna be something they showed a picture of it  like a drawing and they showed i mean you know four thousand feet is four thousand feet but they  just show you three empire state buildings tacked on top of one another and you kind of get a  perspective like yeah that's really high that is really high up jump off with a parachute they're  only gonna allow 120 people on it at any given time even though what the stat they were given 
[00:30:30]  yesterday i can't even imagine this they said was it 70 than the this thing could take the weight  of 70 fully loaded 747s now i don't think i i don't think the ground could take that like the planet  can't take that without squishing how could how could like any structure take that kind of weight 
[00:31:00]  uh they're not messing around because that's a stat that you can't prove though yeah yeah get me 70  uh 77 47s i want them stacked on there i bet it bends bunch of plane fulls of people going what are  we doing why are you bringing us here stop it i have a flight i'm late how do we land on top of  another plane only 120 people though because they don't want it too crowded they want to be able to  watch everybody yeah but they're only putting 120 people at a time but it'll hold the weight of  neptune and it'll uh it'll be just fine uh during an earthquake earthquakes uh the hundred mile an 
[00:31:30]  hour winds they occasionally get blown up the canyon walls uh what do they drill this thing into the  bedrock or whatever apparently the steel beams go 40 feet deep into the solid rock uh on the side of  the cliff 40 feet of steel that doesn't and then it jumps out you know we've all worked a chisel in  our lives yeah you know you're you're hammering these steel beams 40 feet in and that's not weakening 
[00:32:00]  the uh the rim of that part of the canyon i put a few wall anchors in when i'm supposed to put  something on the outside of a building i was putting these grills on the outside of a building  and a few of those wall anchors as you're turning the screw they kind of pull out you know and you're  like i'm just tapping it with a hammer as long as it looks good right 40 feet you know hey maybe the  steel itself can take the way to 70 747s but what about the the rock around it if it works like a 
[00:32:30]  lever and kind of just breaks the rock out well you tumble down with a hundred people just going  this sucks you don't be really funny if they if they came out and they said look uh it's got the  capacity to hold 122 people we're only allowing 120 just to be safe like they just got to the  weight limit on the safe side and so you look around uh among your fellow tourists to see who's uh  overeating uh where the fatties yeah there's gonna be plenty of jokes online hey you're gonna get out 
[00:33:00]  with that person on there actually my collapse who's doing the first walk today buzz aldrin  yes buzz aldrin it's gonna open it up officially yeah yeah he walked on the moon for god's sake  what's what does he care that's gonna suck for a thousand feet just be on the moon now he's trying  out a tourist attraction i know it broke and he fell to his death yeah i know it's a cool tourist  attraction but still it's a tourist attraction yeah what if he just did something like he stood there  it was really quiet and he just took all his clothes and came out of the closet and said the 
[00:33:30]  moon landing was fake and then killed himself the moon landing's fake i'm gay and heaved his body  over the side all he found is his shoes and some women's underpants and his slacks happened  this is a disaster happened to buzz yeah why don't you ever get to see some stuff like that he's lived  his life imagine he just does a swan dive in front of all the media buzz is all man he punched the guy  in the face once for saying the moon landing was fake oh yeah he did on some steps a reporter got  in his face and said what about the uh moon landing uh being fake and uh turned around punched him right 
[00:34:00]  in the face old codger he don't want to hear it hey uh we had a great call but he uh hung up on us  unfortunately maybe he could call back yeah a story about a uh punching a hooker last night oh he punched  a hooker last night we want to see what that was all about you know this little horseshoe thing uh that  they made over the grand canyon uh apparently they're looking to build a lot of hotels and stuff  in between vegas and that because a lot of people take the trip from vegas to go see the grand canyon 
[00:34:30]  and uh a lot of people upset with that other conservations yeah they don't want to turn it  into like a bigger strip of vegas they want to put casinos and stuff like that and apparently this uh  a big investor put a lot of the money into it and he's splitting it with this indian tribe who's  really poor and then eventually when he makes his money back in a nice little profit uh it'll be  turned over completely to these engines over there i like they're poor i like the natural conservation  i think it's good but let's be honest why not throw some hotels i mean it's a hole in the ground 
[00:35:00]  realistically no i'd like to go it's majestic i can't even begin to describe hotels would be cool  though yeah all on the rim honestly yeah there's there's not many places to stay you know close  to the canyon no not many at all they could use a few more hotels and stuff that's meant for like  campsites and stuff like that you're supposed to be very like with nature one with nature when you go 
[00:35:30]  there it's beyond amazing even if you just walk down into it just a little bit you're just blown away  you can't describe it to anyone i i have hundreds and hundreds of pictures pictures don't do it just no  my brother and i went you know i've told the story we hiked all the way down the river and back in one  day which is uh a huge no-no a lot of people die doing that blah blah blah but we took a lot of  pictures along the way and i brought them back and i had a nice camera and all and you still can't  you can't do it just it's one of those things your mind can't even wrap around like you stand on the  rim and look out over it and your mind can't really understand something that huge it's really weird to 
[00:36:00]  look at it it almost looks like a picture when you first look at it and uh it's just great though  the whole the whole thing of going there and just the smell of the area it's really nice and like  naturely when the sun hits it it's good getting back to uh nature yeah when the sun hits it late in  the day just beyond unbelievable you ever been to that meteor crater out there no great meteor crater 
[00:36:30]  yeah it's where a meteor hit like you know a million years ago or something it's a mile wide  and about a quarter mile deep and it's a crater you know there it's pretty freaky that you're  standing somewhere a meteor slammed into it's probably safe to be though because the odds of  one hitting there twice yeah what's gonna happen you sit in there and go what are the you watch  some flaming meteor coming towards you what are the odds this was gonna happen and instinctively  you try to run but where are you going where are you going yeah can you walk down into the middle  of the meteor crater i'm not sure i stayed on the the rim yeah it's one of those yeah it's a tourist 
[00:37:00]  attraction apparently it killed like everything within a hundred mile radius and  actually further than that but it would happen so long ago what the hell do they know what about  how far out does that thing judge does anybody know like how far how far out over the over  the open air does that that horseshoe thing come uh one foot okay  go through all that for one foot out i don't know we'll we'll get that fact for you in a minute here 
[00:37:30]  jimmy or if it was if it was like walled in and there was no glass bottom it's just like walking  through a horseshoe hallway and they tell you you were out over there four thousand feet you have  to believe them imagine it's just a really bad design and there is no walls or anything it's just a  floor oh my god two feet wide right with a little roped off like thing to hold on to  imagine some dummy what we're open for business the first tours with a dumb camera  in a complete panic ah here's the now here's the calls i like anth you are an idiot about the grand 
[00:38:00]  canyon let's go to mark in delaware mark hi mark hey boys how's it going hey good jimmy oh i think  you really need to start controlling the person that's sitting next to you what did i do you you  speak out about things that you have no idea about okay what did i say wrong about the grand canyon sir  i'm open for criticism and correction the first of all when you say that they need to provide proof 
[00:38:30]  that this thing can hold 70 airplanes or whatever it is that's what they're doing when an engineer  signs and seals a drawing that this thing is ready for construction oh my god no you're right  sir because wow oh my god this guy raises the point because we wanted to actually see if they  could get 70 planes yeah i wanted 70 loaded 747s so they could prove it i can hold on you guys are  kind of breaking up oh yeah yeah use that excuse i said i wanted them before i wanted them to use 
[00:39:00]  actually 70 loaded 747s because that's the only way to really prove it right mark well that's the only  reason that they're saying this stuff is because while we have 747s then people are going to start  talking about it like wow that's a lot of weight yeah a lot of stuff but i heard the guy didn't sign  it anyway i heard there's a stamp that they use that's pretty generic and it goes around to all  these sites and the guy will just stamp with the same stamp meanwhile i heard it can only actually  hold 86 pounds 86 pounds yeah that's what i read where'd you read that in the journal of science 
[00:39:30]  what do you think mark come on i know everything mark come on well it's professor anthony i know  mark are you actually calling me out on that mark because i thought maybe because i'm trying to think  of what i said about the grand canyon or something and i'm like i didn't say anything that even went  out that you're comparing laying structural steel into bedrock to anchoring a drywall screw into a wall  oh that's a goof i think i was goofing around you know when i put a like a three inch uh drywall 
[00:40:00]  screw or a cement anchor into a wall you gotta assume now you gotta make this leap of faith mark  you gotta think i'm not really comparing it to something that can hold uh 77 47s  you gotta kind of make that leap of faith when i when i say stuff like that okay mark you are an ass 
[00:40:30]  mark you realize what we're trying to do here this uh brand new uh tourist attraction is is is such a  bore to bring to a radio show that we're really really using all our skills to make it interesting  for you people spicing it up we're adding some hamburger helper to this one that's right  that's the best we can come up with all right my wall anchor analogy right mark didn't like it  he thought they put a couple of plates with some three inch drill screws in the in the rim of the  canyon we want to discuss what america is talking about basically and and find our little twist on 
[00:41:00]  things this one's a toughie mark that was the best we could do for you guys sorry you took it  literally and thought i was an idiot like anthony like anthony's really gonna be hanging over the edge  with a hammer other guys hold the horses could you hold that prop it up all right mark my mallet  guys big fan punching out all right all right mark see it just gives us an opportunity to check off  one of the things on our list talked about the grand canyon grand canyon check now john can't get 
[00:41:30]  angry let's let's talked about it it was in the news where's minelli whoa did someone just walk  behind me i couldn't help was that disappeared into the shadows i think it was creeping john  minnelli where was the flashlight i asked for our pd just kind of slithers around the studio he just  lurks he lurks about then jots things in his little notepad we don't really actually see him he just kind 
[00:42:00]  of lurks about and then writes down notes and sends them to the staff disappears like smoke we know he's  hiding in the shadows let's say hi to david uh david you punched a hooker in the face yeah last  night at a rest area in uh west virginia why did you hurt him i see that implies that you're thank you  i've been i haven't had but three hours sleep since 6 a.m monday morning and i went to bed at nine  o'clock last night don't know further deserved a punch in the face i know it's gonna happen here let 
[00:42:30]  me uh let me play this out david wasn't interested in having a hooker he wanted a little sleep but the  rest area she's knocking on the door there david's like what the hell and punches her in the face and  goes back to bed right david well it's kind of like that she she wouldn't stop knocking on the door  i said well you want to play a game i can too so i got up rolled the window down about halfway let her  climb up on the step of the truck and as soon as she got her face clear of the window i just knocked 
[00:43:00]  the back top of it under the ground i went back to bed i'm thinking like well what the hell is she  going to do call the cops and tell her that she wanted to do something to me for money i didn't  think it was going to go that way i never heard another peep so i went back to bed without any  qualms until i got up at uh 2 15 this morning pulled out and felt a thud thud under his tires  when he left we got to explain explain to the rest of the people out there we've learned a lot 
[00:43:30]  about truckers because of xf satellite radio we had no clue about uh uh what are they called lounge  lizards lot lizards lot lizards lot lizards they're hookers that just kind of hang out at the rest  areas and bother the truckers to the point where a lot of these guys don't want to be with the  hookers and they just want to get a good night's sleep and they're banging on the doors all the time  right that's it and they do it at the truck stops they do it in the restos or wherever they find  they think it's convenient there's no cops and they can get away with it but can't you just can't 
[00:44:00]  just annoying can't you like uh i don't know hang a sign on the door that you're not interested isn't  there some kind of some kind of uh understand understanding with the lot lizards you can go to  the truck stops and buy these little stickers in front of them and you want it says this guy like the  uh the circle with the uh line through it says no lot lizards but i mean they don't pay attention  to that crap all they're out for us to get money but you got your truckers out there too  yeah you want to get the syphilis face bitches and aids and whatever else they can get a hold of 
[00:44:30]  but was she pretty no she looked like a freaking i don't know probably the ass end of a dog that's  been dragging it across the carpet uh what happened after you knocked her down uh i went back to bed  you went to sleep i ain't gonna say what i said because you're on regular radio but  how do you sleep after like not knowing if someone's gonna like slash your tires or brick  your windshield do what now how'd you sleep i mean i would have been afraid that she was gonna  slash my tires or throw a brick to the windshield light your gas tank on fire yeah i have they 
[00:45:00]  slash a tire i just i'll have it prepared i don't worry about that kind of stuff or dude if she  was really mad maybe like take her finger and write wash me in the back of the truck in the dirt  shenanigans if they get up on my trailer well it's just gonna be a cold sleep because i got a  flatbed so they'll still be outside anyway all right well thanks for the story david you punched  a hooker in the face last night very good guys way to handle it uh we try we try although there's  haters out there thank you david uh it's the opian anthony show it's whip them out wednesday

[00:48:30]  great uh thread about what i should name my book and i am honestly the book is done i am stuck it has i have  two days so listener suggestions uh i'm just stuck i wrote this stupid thing and i cannot think of a  title because i'm going to think of a title does not want to use the name i want it to use which  all right it's a little too weird for them so it's fine well what's uh the book about because that'll  help the people out there a lot about my prostitution my life uh just like little entries some of the old  blog entries a lot have been changed a lot of new stuff you know it's just just entries mostly about

[00:49:30]  hey uh todd the beavis kid the video is up on youtube i think we uh sent it to break.com as well  the kid that was doing the acapella uh heavy metal songs yeah heavy metal doesn't work very well  acapella this guy kind of pulled it off though did he yeah he he joined the second half of our show  we were having just a little like get together and someone uh brought it to our attention that  this kid todd does great heavy metal acapella screaming and he's very nerdy looking yeah so it 
[00:50:00]  kind of makes the video kind of funny it's up on youtube if you want to check it out just throw opie  and anthony in the search it's one of the latest videos we added but uh we have the audio here of him  do a metallica enter sandman this is todd the beavis kid  like a metal monster  this is the beavis kid 
[00:50:30]  a điều to stop and free the smoking fire  drowing it with vetted soaring out  he is the paper and this is the paper 
[00:51:00]  that's the greatest of fun-headed fighters out there  oh my god  oh my god  They all pulled their shirts up over their heads like Beavis.  He looked like Beavis, too.  Yeah, not too awkward.  That was the one I did not want to play.  That was Judas Priest's painkiller.  Yeah.  It was labeled wrong.  Here's Metallica, Inner Sandman, Todd the Beavis Kid, heavy metal, acapella.  Dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun. 
[00:51:30]  Say not please, little ones.  Don't forget my son.  Do you include everyone?  I'll tuck you in, Lois and TVO-35 sin.  Tell this sandman he comes.  See for the road I open.  Give it your pillow tight.  Exit light  Exit light  Take my hand 
[00:52:00]  We're off to never, never  That end  Coughing up blood after that  The visual's pretty good  You don't expect a voice to come out of this kid  Like that little nerdy kid  With a sore throat now 
[00:52:30]  It's also on Heavy.com  They're helping us out with that video  Jimmy, what about Yellow Discipline?  I thought of that, but I've already used it  I don't really talk much about that in the book  What about Monster Rain?  I thought of that  Because I do describe that in detail  But again, it's probably too weird for most people  A little too weird wouldn't be  Here's the thing  People who listen to the radio show  Kind of understand what we do  And would understand certain things  But they want to market it to people  Who basically don't listen to the show  And the title they had  I didn't like 
[00:53:00]  It was too plain  What was it?  They came up with Happy Endings  Which I get why they like that  It's explanatory  But it's not what I want to do  It's a little too generic  That's what a guy who just goes to a massage parlor  Once would call it  Not a guy who spent half his income  Being alone  Yeah, it can't be something that  Like only the show people get  Right  You know, people that are familiar with the show  Because one guy is suggesting  You know, Frankus  Nah, it's too weird  Or something like that  No one would understand what that means  Unless they know the show  Hmm  So, yeah  Well, gonna have to think about that, Jimmy 
[00:53:30]  Wrote the whole book  And you can't come up with a name  That's good  And it's final  The copy editor has it now  They're just going over like quotation marks  And like commas and all that crap  Punctuation  Yeah, punctuation  Making sure your punctuation is right  Yes, because I don't use one period  Or one capital letter in the entire book  I have no chapter breaks  Just one big run-on sentence  One of the funniest suggestions I read  One guy said I should call it  My act with chapter breaks  Which, it's actually not my act  But I think it was very funny titles  I must have been a smart-ass comedian friend 
[00:54:00]  That was very funny  Alright, hey  It's time for MacBook Karaoke  Yes  We're giving away MacBooks all week long  MacBook Karaoke is a big hit with the listeners  Well, we've had such stars come out of this  I mean, it rivals American Idol  Yesterday, we voted for the goof  Some gay guy  Or gay-sounding guy  Singing a song from Aladdin  From Aladdin  And then the day before  We went with a really, really good singer 
[00:54:30]  Yeah, a girl could sing  So we went with that  And who knows today  See, it keeps them guessing  We don't know  Sam is telling me  We have a doozy in the bunch here  A doozy, Sam?  We got a doozy  I like one of them  I'll try to figure out which one that is  Alright, we'll start with  Time After Time by Carrie  In North Dakota  This is for a MacBook  Sometimes you picture me  And I'm walking too far ahead

[00:55:30]  It's the Captain and Tennille  Their house is a lot of porno shoes  They've got in their old house  That of the Carpenters  She's a drumstick  Stenula singing  Peaches and yuck  I wish she was Marcel Marceau  I'll be waiting  She's okay  Yeah  That's robot  You know what the worst thing is  Like I remember being a radio fan 
[00:56:00]  And listening  And sending things in  And having them played  Like I remember this  And you're so excited  It starts up  And you listen  And then when the host just bashes it  It crushes you  It's a big bummer  I remember these things  Like they were yesterday man  Like sending stuff in  I mean that's how I got this job  I sent stuff in to radio stations  And sometimes it was just like  You know  Play a piece of it  And then  Alright that's crap  Or god that sucks  And you want to 
[00:56:30]  Wait wait wait for that  And you're like  Oh no  No it gets better  And like you don't want to look at anybody  Yeah  It's really crushing  But now I'm on the other side  So screw them  That sucked ass  That really was bad  It was a bit robotic  Yeah  It was very generic  Well let's see what  Sorry dog  Let's see what  Kimberly in Jersey did  This is  Beauty  And the Beast  Oh  Another Broadway production  Based on a Disney  Musical 
[00:57:00]  Will this win  The MacBook  Certain as the sun  Rising in the east  Sail as old as time  Song as old as time  Beauty and the Beast  Sail as old as time  Song as old as time  Beauty and the Beast 
[00:57:30]  Yeah  That would have been  A lot better  With just a little more reverb  Yeah  Wow  Five  What is that?  Yeah  She's singing in a cave  Yeah  Yeah that was  Alright  And I could tell  She was using a lot of reverb  There were a few little areas 
[00:58:00]  That were a little off  Well did she beat  Time after time  I put them in a very close  Very close tie  Those two  Okay  That would be a tough one  To decide between  Just those two  Very tough  Jimmy what about  Monster Rain  Names for the book  Wait it's just updated  I hope it's on a song  Tales of how I blow my wad  Or how I blew my wad  Um I didn't spend all my money  Um so  Probably  Probably  Eh  It's a little too long  Hmm 
[00:58:30]  I admit that other part  Is in small  It's gotta be something  That people can look at  They don't know Jim  From a hole in the wall  They don't  Well they might know  Jim threw a hole in the wall  That's in the book  Page 52  They  But uh  You know  They gotta  It's gotta be something  You look at  And kinda know  What the gist of it's gonna be  By the title  I hope there's something  In the book  Where you're coming to work  After we read it  And we all like  Read your book  Oh boy  I didn't expect that 
[00:59:00]  Sorry you can't work here anymore  I'm uh  I'm in for the second one  I'll have to have reactions  For the first one  Because the first one  Just goes up to a certain  Period of time  Yeah  That's good  Good way to leave it  1971  Cliffhanger  71  First three years of my life  I talk about my parents  And what we ate  A lot of baby food stories  Yeah  Alright hold on a minute  We got our  I don't know what to put on the cover  I have to do a cover shoot  That's why I'm gonna eat very healthy

[01:07:30]  That was not  Wow  Well you were so embarrassed  You went in there to do your thing  Not the thing that people think you'd do in the bathroom  Just a little thing  Yeah  Normally I'd just sit in there and eat egg salad  Oh my god  It followed you out  Wow  Our phone number  1-866-313-FREE  Um  Couple things  Anthony wants to turn a lot of people on to a new website  That's Hot Enough  I heard about it this morning  It's hotenough.org  I just thought it was a 
[01:08:00]  Oh god  Jimmy  Yeah that is really bad  It's really bad  Oh  Filled the whole room up  I didn't  That was from the other room  Yeah  Yeah well  I'm sorry  I think the door pushed it forward  Yeah  As you closed the door  Some of it came out  And then the door propelled it toward us  It followed me  It followed you  Watch it like fat chicks  They just follow you around  I'm going to shake it  And then it's like  Wait wait wait wait  Yeah this I saw it on the news this morning  Apparently getting a little bit of attention 
[01:08:30]  You know there's a lot of dating sites  There's thousands of them out there now  And you really can't sort out  You got to fill out a bunch of stuff I guess  And see if you can get the right girl  And the pictures are like MySpace pictures  Where you see maybe the eyes  Or some distorted thing of a side of the head  Or a picture when they looked good seven years ago  Yeah  And then you go to the rest of their pictures  At a wedding  Yeah yeah  Looking their best  And you go to the rest of the pictures  And you know there's a problem  Or God forbid you meet them live on a blind date 
[01:09:00]  Kind of a thing  And there's a problem  Well this guy decided he was sick of that  So he made his own website  Where it's just hot girls  So you go there  And I guess it's a site also for girls  To go to look for guys  Okay is it a dating site?  Yeah  Yeah so it's not one of these sites  Where you know you just look at girls  And then you rate them?  No no no  These are girls that you go out with I guess 
[01:09:30]  They're looking for guys  They're looking for guys  That aren't fat slobs  And there are guys there  That are looking for girls  That aren't fat slobs  Now how do they control it?  By  They have to post their picture  It's got to be a full length picture too  You got to see their whole body and everything  Nice  And then the people that go to this site  Rate the girls  If they don't rate over an eight  They get thrown off the site  So it keeps the collection of people that are in there 
[01:10:00]  Of good caliber  It's only the beautiful people  So you're only getting the good ones  Yeah and of course some people are outraged at this  That it's just  Why?  Because it's you know  It's what's inside that people are looking for  Yeah exactly  What's inside  And you know  It's making fat people  Or unattractive people  It's being biased  They have dating sites with fat people 
[01:10:30]  Go to wildkingdom.com  I say we blow up their spots  And just start rating some of these girls with  Rate them really bad  Yeah give them a bunch of twos  Until they're knocked off  Join up give them ones  To knock the average way down  Yeah  The site's called hotenough.org  And I'm looking at it  Yeah nothing but hot chicks  Yeah  Nothing but hotties  Some of them are probably models and strippers  Just to get hot chicks  Do you think that it's a ringer type thing going on?  Because I wasn't sure of that either  They kind of look like normal pictures though 
[01:11:00]  They don't look like model pictures  I know  No they're normal girls  You can tell  There's one girl kind of behind a bar  Yeah  The other one in a little short skirt  Just kind of in her kitchen  Every once in a while you get like a bottle shot  Like a hubby  A hubby  That's her name on hotenough.org  Oh  It looks more like a model shot  But in general it looks like regular pictures  At weddings and at clubs  And hanging out at some friend's house  Do they have guys there too?  Iraq  Find the gentleman 
[01:11:30]  For Jimmy  Jimmy wants to find the gentleman  I want to get my picture up there  Oh  You know something?  We should all just put our pictures up there  And see what we rate  What's going on?  Yeah great  Yeah  There's the guy  Wow  Let's see if we can get our picture up there  Because I got to take a picture  With Chris Hansen yesterday  Oh the other day  I don't know how my girlfriend does it  I'm like 
[01:12:00]  What was wrong with your picture with Chris Hansen?  Everything from the chest up  Was wrong with my head  I was looking back at him  And my neck  I'm just a mushy  I'm awful  I mean all kidding aside  I don't know how my girlfriend does it  I'm like who do you picture?  Whoever it is  God bless you  I think she's fantasizing  If she wasn't  It would be  Things would dry up like a heat lamp  Maybe she's in love with your sense of humor  Your inner soul  Yeah exactly  That's exactly what it is she loves  That's what she says right? 
[01:12:30]  That's what's wrong with this site  Someone like Jimmy perhaps wouldn't make the cut  As far as  Why are you saying he wouldn't make the cut?  I said perhaps  I don't know who these people are rating them  Our little Jimmy's fragile to begin with  Now you're telling him that he's not going to make the site?  I know  I wouldn't make the cut  Not either  I'm a funny guy  I want to take a full length picture and send it in  Send it in  Let's do it  Alright  Let's try it  And try to get you a rating of 8 or above  I want to see  Let's see if I can get a rating of 8 or above 
[01:13:00]  If the listeners would go and rate me like a 9  I mean even though it's a goof  Your computer might not even allow you to do it  You'll be the Sanjaya of hotenough.org  Vote this fat neck off  I don't get it  He continues to get 9's and 10's  We can't get him off the site  Alright we'll figure out how to do that  We'll get you up there  But there's a little attention as far as that website goes today  Today hotenough.org  Also 
[01:13:30]  We're looking at the top 10 gay animals  In the animal kingdom  Have you checked this out yet?  I can say  No  One of the listeners  Sent this in through the instant feedback  Thank you  Now what's the criteria here for  If an animal is gay  I would gather  The same as it is for humans  If they like  Getting together with their own sex  Well stupid me  When I heard about this  I thought animals that just look gay  Oh okay 
[01:14:00]  Like a peacock  Yeah  A peacock  A male peacock looks gay  Yeah there's nothing  Very flamboyant and colorful  Nothing really manly about the peacock  Yeah  So stupid me  I'm like oh it's just animals that don't look manly  They look gay  All the decorative stuff is around his ass  I know my thinking is unorthodox  I'm sorry  But I didn't hear you  I didn't  All right  Thought that was going to get something  I look over at Jim  See if maybe he was reading  He's looking right at me  That was great  I say it 
[01:14:30]  I expect a laugh  And I'm like no one's laughing  I look over at Jim  Totally expecting to see him distracted  He didn't hear it  He's just looking at me with that smile like  You just bombed  There's nothing more fun than bombing in front of Jimmy  He gives you a look that is so pleasing to him  He gets very happy  He gets very happy  It doesn't happen often  He loves when people bomb  Well you want to run through this list?  Oh Christ 
[01:15:00]  I guess the criteria  You know you got the animal people out there  Just kind of watching the animals  And then they decided  They decided who was gayer  It's actually a numbered  Yeah  Little thing here  And it goes from 10 to 1  For example  The 10th gayest species  Is the  Bonobo  Bonombo  Bonobo  Bonobo  Bonobo chimpanzees 
[01:15:30]  Yeah  Homosexuality has been documented  In almost 500 species of animals  Signaling that sexual preferences  Predetermined  Considered the closest living relative to humans  Bonobos are not shy about seeking sexual pleasure  Nearly all of these peace loving apes are bisexual  And often resolve conflict by the make love not war principle  Oh boy  They copulate frequently  Scream out in delight while doing so  And often engage in homosexual activities 
[01:16:00]  About two thirds of the homosexual activities are amongst females  Oh okay  It's even hotter in that part of the animal kingdom  A lot of lesbos out there  Lesbian chimps  As far as that species goes  Yes  Yee  Uh huh  Well I  See I'm kind of  They can't actually prove that homosexuality or sexual  Whatever sexual preference is predetermined by animals  It's the human that has the divine spark  Right bright eyes  Damn dirty homosexual apes 
[01:16:30]  Damn you  Take your stinking paws off my yam bag  You damn dirty homo ape  Zira why don't you leave me and Cornelius here in the room together  Come here Cornelius  First show me where it is  With your red mandrel ass  Alright  What happened 
[01:17:00]  There's a scar on your head there  There's like a scar  What  A scar  They uh  Oh  They might uh  Damn you  Cut out his brain  That's right  You queer  You whole monkey  Yeah  Homosexual activity  My god  Look  Look what they've done  They've posed my two friends I came with in the museum 
[01:17:30]  Doggy style  The ultimate embarrassment for eternity  Dr. Zayas  Another prostate exam Dr. Zayas  Is that all you do to us  Damn you to hell  Planet of the homosexual apes  Planet of the homo apes  Me and Dr. Zayas and Cornelius visited a cave at the end of Planet of the Apes 
[01:18:00]  Do you remember  Yes I do  Remember what was in that cave  It was a big man  Glasses  Here's a look  A heart valve  This shows that people  Look  A double dong dildo  This proves that there was intelligent homo life  Before the homo ape  Damn you  It proves your sacred scrolls are wrong  If you'd read them instead of using them on each other  Try unrolling one one time and read it 
[01:18:30]  Damn homo ape  Damn you  Why is the statue of liberty holding a butt plug  You blew it  Up  They violated the statue so much they had to bury it in the sand  To hide what they did to the damn thing 
[01:19:00]  Damn you  Homo apes  These are chimpanzees  Number  Number ten  Yeah  The chimp  What about number nine  Try unrolling it  Well  Number nine  We got another monkey in the mix  We're looking at the top ten gay animals out there  The Japanese macaque  The hell is that  Macaque 
[01:19:30]  Female macaques form intense bonds with each other  And are serially monogamous  Meaning they only have one sexual partner at a time  However  They have several of these relationships during each breeding season  Female macaques engage in sexual activities such as  Stimulation of certain monkey areas  Yeah  And vocalize their delight in forms of cackling sounds 
[01:20:00]  Males also take to homosexual play  But tend to leave their partner soon after  Making it what we call in the human world  A one night stand  Ah  Ah  Great  It's funny  See the male macaque in a robe  With a small dog  Sipping banana broth  I'm not feeling well today  Alright 
[01:20:30]  You wanna move on or  The macaque  Yeah  Top ten gay animals  Number eight  This could be a real problem  If you  If you  If you ran into one of these  A homosexual  Gray whale  Who knew  Oh my god  Splashing around in the water  Is brought to a completely new level  In gray whales  Where homosexual interactions are quite common  In slip and slide orgies  As many as five males  Roll around 
[01:21:00]  Splashing water  And rubbing their bellies  Against each other  So that  Certain whale  Things are  Touching  I knew it was weird  Because I was out on a boat one time  And I saw a 500 foot wall  With a giant hole in it  Oh my god  How does a gray whale go  Yeah  Whale songs  Oh that is awful 
[01:21:30]  They figure this stuff out  I don't know  This is  Someone has too much time  On their hands  If they're studying homosexuality  In the  In the animal kingdom  Number  Number seven  Is the cob antelope  Arr  Thar he blows  That's what they would say  When the whale ship  Would pull up  And see the whale  The cob antelope 
[01:22:00]  On average  Females mount  With other females  A couple of times  Each hour  During the mating season  Homosexual mounting  Encompasses almost 9%  Of all sexual activities  Within these  Hooved mammals  In the wild  While courting  The pursuer  Sidles up behind  A pal  And raises her  Foreleg  Touching the other  Female  In certain female  Cob antelope places  Jesus 
[01:22:30]  I can't believe  We're adults  This leggy foreplay  Ultimately leads  To mounting  But obviously  If they're female  A lot of female  Homosexuality  In the animal kingdom  Animals are hot  Yeah  Lesbos  In the animal kingdom  And who knew  The big  Strong  Symbol  Of the old west  The American bison  What  Is gay  Homosexual mounting  Between males  Tend to be more common  Than heterosexual 
[01:23:00]  Female  Male copulation  Among American bison  Especially because  Females  Only mate  With the bulls  About once a year  During mating season  Males engage  In same sex activity  Several times a day  More than 55%  Of mounting  In young males  Is with the same gender  How about that  All the females  Are the CT's  I know  Not giving it up  Once  If they want it  Once  Or if they mate  Once a year  Doesn't mean you can't  You know 
[01:23:30]  Have a little fun  That's why they're chasing  Those people in Spain  Every year  Okay  The American bison  Okay  Walrus  Number five  Yeah  As far as gay animals go  The walrus is number five  Yeah  They don't reach their  Sexual maturity  Until they're four  During that time  The most likely  Exclusively involved  In same sex relationships  Oof  Ugh  Just  The older males  Are typically bisexual  Old queens 
[01:24:00]  They do have  Big fat old  Walrus queens  They look like  An old queen  They got the  They got the  The homo mustache  The old 70's  Porno mustache  On that walrus  Yuck  It's a wonder  That their  Main food  Is fish though  You would think  It'd be turned off  Can you picture that walrus  Hurting its knee  Bug my knee man 
[01:24:30]  Wow  The older males  Are typically bisexual  Mating with females  During breeding season  And copulating  With other males  The rest of the year  Here are the mating sounds  Of the walrus  Shh  Let's listen  Oh  There they go  Very privileged  To have these sounds  Oh  Wow 
[01:25:00]  Doesn't sound good  That was a walrus  That wasn't really  Into it  This one's a fighter  Alright enough 
[01:25:30]  Enough  Stop  Please  Well yeah  The walruses  They rub their bodies  Together  Embrace each other  Wow  Yuck  And even sleep together  In water  There you go  Moving up  The charts  Number four  Oh no  Top ten  This is the name  Oh boy  Guyannan  Guyannan 
[01:26:00]  Yes  The Guyannan  Cock of the Rock  It's a bird  Males of this  Stunning  Perching bird  Delight in homosexuality  Almost forty percent  Of the male population  Engages in a form  Of homosexual activity  And a small percentage  Don't ever copulate  With females  Wow  A bird  How do they tell  Come on  Stop  How do they tell  Little bird brains  Just  Because when one  Tours  Instead of like 
[01:26:30]  Eating the worm  He just slaps  His friend in the face  And now  I'm not gonna  I don't believe this  Number three  No  No  This is a beloved animal  Yeah  No  No  The giraffe  Gay giraffes  Gay giraffes  Gay giraffes  Number three  Male courtships  Are frequently  Frequent amongst  These long necked mammals  Often a male  Will start necking  With another  Before proceeding  To mount 
[01:27:00]  This affectionate play  Can take up to an hour  According to one study  One in every twenty  Male giraffes  Will be found  Necking with another male  At any instant  One in twenty  That's five percent  It's less than humans  Why aren't humans in this  Before the giraffe  I think the problem is  That their necks are so long  It's just not worth it  To go all the way down  Oh yeah  You're right  They just do some necking  That could be a problem  You can't get your hoof up  That high behind his head 
[01:27:30]  To push it down  Stupid giraffes  Let's say hi to John in Jersey  John what's going on  Hey what's up boys  I want to thank you guys now  Because at least I can  Push down on my divorce papers  I'm divorcing her  Because she's a bison  Oh your wife's a bison  Apparently so  Yeah  Alright sir  Thank you  Goodbye  In many cases 
[01:28:00]  Homosexual activity  Is said to be more common  Than heterosexual  In the giraffe  Well we've heard about this  Number two  Another beloved  Mammal of the sea  Very very  Very horny animal  But we've heard  Yeah  Jay Moore actually  Told a story  About him going out  And swimming  With the dolphins  Coming in number two  Bottlenose dolphins  And being like  Sexually molested  By one  Homosexual activity  Occurs with about  The same frequency 
[01:28:30]  As heterosexual play  Amongst these marine mammals  Male bottlenose dolphins  Are generally bisexual  But they go through  Periods of being  Exclusively homosexual  Homosexual activities  The homosexual activities  Of these mammals  Include oral sex  During which time  One dolphin stimulates  The other with its snout  Males also rub  Their male dolphin parts  Against the body parts  Of their partner  Their dolphin partner  That seems needy 
[01:29:00]  Hey hold on  I'm laughing my ass off  Because Sean in Illinois  It says  I have a homosexual dog  Sean what's going on  Not much  Yeah I got a lab  That will hump my boxer  And she's fixed  That's the crazy part  Wait she  Yeah they're both female  Oh they're both female  Oh okay I gotcha  Yeah dogs just  So any dog  A male or female  Just jumps on  They have  They have no preference

[01:30:00]  Annually  Almost a quarter  Of all families  Are parented  By homosexual couples  That remain together  For years  At times  Male couples  Use the services  Of a female  By mating with her  Once she lays  A clutch of eggs  Dutch clutch  Of eggs  They want to  The wannabe fathers  Chase her away  And shoo  And hatch the eggs  Themselves  Other times  They just drive away  Heterosexual couples

[01:39:30]  Oh thank God  Today it only took  What two hours  Sam  Yeah more or less  Yeah see  We're very obsessed  With Steve Harvey  This week  Because an AP article  Came out  A couple days ago now  Or yesterday morning  And he's just  Bragging about his ratings  And how he's doing  So well  And they kind of  Take some shots  At us  You play urban music  Of course you're  Going to do well  He starts his show  With gospel music  He talks about God  He's really not  Really doing  A funny creative radio show 
[01:40:00]  But for some reason  People are into  The God thing  I guess  I guess God's  Pretty popular  Is he  He's making a comeback  He's making a comeback  That's what he's supposed to do  And people enjoy  A gospel song  I don't know  But this AP article  Went everywhere  And we're mentioned  Throughout the whole article  Steve Harvey arrived  18 months ago  In the kingdom  Of the radio shock jocks  Where the royalty  Included Howard Stern  Don Imus  And Opie and Anthony  The king of comedy  Surveyed the raunchy landscape  And launched his  Morning drive time show  With some trepidation  Now we talked about  Steve Harvey yesterday  And we got a lot of 
[01:40:30]  Pissed off people  Calling the show  For some reason  Well a couple  And they were  And we're just  Presenting the facts  The guy's not funny  On the radio  I think they were  More his demo  Than just the average fan  Let's say  Yeah  Yeah  I could tell somehow  Through the phone  Well maybe we get  Some black people  On the phone  I know what you're  Getting at  Well yeah  We'll play another  We'll play another clip  From Steve Harvey  As he enters  The department of funny  And you as a black person  You tell us why it's funny  Because he said 
[01:41:00]  He goes  When it comes to  The funny department  No one's better than him  He credited God  But also his own  Comedic skills  Yeah this is his quote  That is driving us nuts  Today and yesterday  You can't beat me  In the funny department  I guarantee this show  Is way funnier  Than Steve Harvey's  Dopey show  I think Bob Edwards  Show is  Creep  Oh we bomb  We know when we're bombing  But every morning  We give you  Definitely a bunch of laughs  But he says  You can't beat me  In the funny department 
[01:41:30]  Oh you can beat him  In the information department  And you can get me  In the looks department  But you can't beat me  In the funny department  And he thought that line  Was so clever  It's used two or three times  In this AP article  And then they basically say  That all we're good for  Is you know  Our weekly Wednesday hunt  For female flesh  Of course  Talking about  Whip him out Wednesday  Whip him out Wednesday  Which is happening  As we do our show right now  Can't call it a weekly hunt  For female flesh  The black swan  Has a better shot  Of getting a rack  Flash at him  A bunch of fat guys 
[01:42:00]  Enjoy it  So we're obsessed  With the department  Of funny  So Sam's whole job  The last couple days  He's just listening  To Steve Harvey's show  And I swear to you  Like Sam  As soon as he does  Something that you think  Might be funny  Rush it in here  Yesterday it took  An hour and a half  Today it took  Almost two hours  Almost two hours  Before he even went  Into the department  Of funny  Yes  The funny department  Yes  I wait for his hole  To laugh  And then that's how  I know  What is it mostly  Just like talking 
[01:42:30]  And music  Yeah I mean  When they start the show  I guess he's trying  To be inspirational  In the beginning  That's his 12 minutes  Of gospel  Interlined with  Letters that people  Have sent him  And he's giving them  Advice of how to  Do things  How to live their life  And wow that's great  Why would  Why would Steve Harvey  Know  Like  I don't know  Is he like Dr. Phil now  I don't know  It's just a nice show  It is a nice  It's just one of these  Nice shows  Maybe people like  Nice shows after all  Maybe we ought to be nice  Well I've heard 
[01:43:00]  He's not nice in person  I don't know him  But I've heard  That like people said  They would try to get  Pictures with him  And stuff like that  Like hey can I take a picture  And he's like yup  And he just keeps walking  Which I kind of love  In a weird way  Did that happen to you Jimmy  Oh no I'd tell you  Alright  I'd tell you  Well today Steve Harvey  Returns to the funny department  And does the country news  Country news  And this is the first thing  We thought might be funny  On his show  After two hours  Alright  Of listening  Wish I knew that was a tree  I'd plant one in my yard  Wow 
[01:43:30]  You made Anthony sneeze  Down my shirt  What I did there  Is I poured gas on the floor  Of the funny department  And I burned it to the ground  With children in it  And I also think he has like  An afro  Afro helmet of hair  Hockey helmet thing going on  Yeah  It looks like  You ever see the late night commercials  For the hair restoring  Yeah  For hair replacement 
[01:44:00]  And they always show  The black guy  And his little  It looks like  Snap-on fro  Kind of clicks right on there  That's what it looks like  It's like  That's not snap-on  It's snap-on  Nah they just used the velcro  Is that it  Velcro to velcro  The few remaining little hairs  That'll left hook nicely  In the velcro  Yeah  They glue it like the thing  That you stick to your windshield  To hold your easy pass on  Can I punch my way out of the corner  A little rope-a-dope 
[01:44:30]  Slugging Jim  Yeah  You're out  Here we go  The country news  With Steve Harvey  As he returns  To the funny department  Country news everybody  This is news  That you can use  I'm my brother's brother  And that's  And I'm his brother  Alright  We're brothers  I'm his brother  He's my brother  Country news is to use  That you can use everybody  Yeah  What?  First of all  Let me just jump it off  Go ahead brother 
[01:45:00]  I was listening to the radio  And I had this  Colored on there  Oh  Hold up  Hold up  Change it for him  Excuse me  They're different  What is your own organization  Not named  The National Association  For the Advancement  Of Colored People  That's what it's called  Now you don't want  To be called colored  Quit calling yourselves colored  We're working on that  Have a meeting  Do you guys ever meet?

[01:45:30]  Are you kidding me?  That's terrible  I'm sorry  That made my tree joke  Look like Woody Allen's  Moose bit  I love that reference Jimmy  I get it  I have a problem with that 
[01:46:00]  I know  On a couple of levels  Of course  First of all  First of all  It's fun being in the funny department  I don't see it as being in the funny department  Maybe  Maybe in the black community  It's funny  It's the department of funny  Department of funny  Yeah  Black community might find that funny  Because he's doing a take off  On white hicks  You know  The south  On people from the south  Okay  But it was incredibly racist  But it was an awful take off  On the south 
[01:46:30]  Yeah  Like Pryor did  Pryor did on Bicentennial Nigger  There's a great opening bit  Which is him being  You know  Just a whole thing  On country  Idiot white people  Yeah  And it's brilliant  It's hillbillies  It's funny  That's not a good  That was like hack  Everything he did was hack too  Like my brother's brother  Alright we get it  The south  They're having sex  With each other  You know  That's kind of hack  And then  Yeah  And then the other piece of that  Well there's more Ant 
[01:47:00]  No stop it  Yeah there's more  Please  Hey he challenged us  I mean this AP article  He says you can't beat me  In the funny department  So we want to  See what this guy's all about  As far as his  Radio show goes  The funny department  The country news continues  The country boys  Talk about black people food  Yeah but now  We're going to have to start  Y'all barbecue  Well we do that anyway  Quiet as us care  But we act like  We don't barbecue  Because we got it from them  But they're going to want to fry it  You know they are  They do it all 
[01:47:30]  I'm confused  I don't know  Which is the  The country character  And which one is the black character  Yeah they can't really do  Country very well  Their black is coming through  I think because the one guy  Is trying to do like  A southern accent  Steve Harvey's getting  Kind of like  Dragged into it  And he's starting to sound  Like country  Yeah  When he should sound  As black as possible  Because I think that's  What he's supposed to be  The country guys  Talking to the black guy  No they're both country guys  I think they both  Yeah they're both country guys  I'm assuming  And a colored guy  Why is it 
[01:48:00]  What he said was  A colored guy  I think was coming over  Or something  Okay  Or something like that  And they have to now  Figure out what they're going to do  As far as barbecuing  And making them feel welcome  Okay here we go  Anyway quiet as it's kept  But we don't barbecue  Because we got it from them  But they're going to want to fry it  You know they are  They do it all the time  Let me ask you a question  What do you have against fried chicken?

[02:00:00]  That's just what  The world needs  Vince  A third volume  Are you getting  To the point  Where you just  You've just decided  To start admitting  Things that aren't true  Like hmm  I'll tell him  Let me write this  The truth is  You operate within  This world  It's like this  Surreal world  If you've ever seen  The backstage area  And Vince McMahon  Is like you know  You couldn't come up  With a guy like that  In a science fiction movie  So you can just  Take people in this case  On like a six week  Journey behind the scenes  I had an idea 
[02:00:30]  I thought it would be  The greatest idea  Of my career  That's it  I'll just write it  Like it's a diary  Follow this idea  You know throughout  The course  Oh so the book  Is about you  Backstage  At WWE  Backstage  Going through  Yeah getting ready  For what I thought  Would be the greatest  Idea of my life  Pitching storylines  And stuff  Exactly  And how it plays out  Yeah and when it  Was obvious  That things were not  Going to turn out  Like I wanted them to  I also realized  That hey actually  I guess it makes  For a better book  If you you know  Have a disaster  On your hands  It's like nobody  Went to see the Titanic  Because it was a good 
[02:01:00]  Cruise right  You know  A disaster  And Vince said  Hey pal  How's that book coming  And he had told me  When I was  When I agreed to write  He says  No I want you  To be brutally honest  And I said  Well Vince  You know  You know the way I am  You know  I said  You know  I kind of want  To be upbeat  And optimistic  He goes  You can be upbeat  But I want you  To hammer people  So a couple  Not bad right  I'm not an Anthony  Voice guy  But not bad  A couple weeks into it  When it was obvious  Things were not working out 
[02:01:30]  Like I wanted  I said  I was at book pal  I said  Well Vince  I've got good news  And bad news  He goes  Okay let me hear it  I said  Well the good news is  I definitely hammer somebody  He says  Oh that's what I like to hear  The bad news  I said  The guy I hammer  Is you  He goes  Oh  He doesn't care  You know  I mean  There's even a thing in there  When I was talking about Vince  Making fun of J.R.  When J.R. had the colon surgery  And it was like  One of those things  Like when I was watching it  When Vince was Dr. Heine  You know  And he was  And he had nurse 
[02:02:00]  Slobberknockers  You know  And Vince was essentially  Pulling out objects  From you know  What was supposedly  J.R.'s crevice  His anal cavity  And at first  It was kind of funny  It was like an Oklahoma  You know  Football helmet  Being pulled out  And go  You know  But by the time  He pulled like  The 12th or 13th  Object out  It was like  The guys were like  Just kind of looking  At the floor  Like oh  I can't believe  I work for this  Mami  And so I wrote  In the book  Somewhere in there  You know  Hey Vince  You know  Colon surgery  Is not really 
[02:02:30]  That funny  As a matter of fact  I only know  One person  Who found it amusing  You  And when it came  To WWE legal  Once they realized  You know  Geez  This book  Is kind of critical  Of WWE  They brought  Certain passages  To Vince  And you can  Picture lawyers  Hovering over his shoulder  Stupid lawyers  We were waiting  Because Vince  Has got a temper  You know  I mean  He's been known  To erupt  From time to time  But in this case  He read that  And he went  Oh that was funny  So you know  I actually 
[02:03:00]  The only thing  He got mad about me  Is that I thought  Hey this is  You know  Granted  I'm kind enough  To point out  His faults  Throughout the book  But the fact  That he let me  Write it  And didn't  Censor it  Was something  I really admired  So I went to him  I said Vince  You know  I dedicated this book  To you  And that's the only  Time I got mad  He said  Oh damn it  Why did you have  To do that  You know  So he was offended  By the fact  I dedicated the book  To him  He is  He is  One of a kind  I think we're  Talking to him  Tomorrow  WrestleMania is 
[02:03:30]  Right around the corner  So  Over the years  He's just been  Great  I was just  Thumbing through  The book  And a lot of  Pictures  Which is good  Yeah  I like a lot  Of good pictures  Some of the  Old time  Pictures  Of you  And there's  One of Vince  With his pants  Pulled down  And just bare assed  And you are  About to  About to kiss  His ass  Yes  I remember that storyline  Not a high point  In my career  Because as you remember  I was trying to save 
[02:04:00]  Melina's job  Right  She was a young lady  I was very fond of  Explain that storyline  I mean  You would have to kiss  Vince came in  He was having a bad day  So the way Vince is  He would take it out  And somebody  Who had nothing  To do with it  You know  And honestly  He got so irate  And I'm not  Trying to make it  You know  Make this up  And I said  Hey Vince  And he went  You just called me Vince  And I'm thinking  I've been calling this guy Vince  For you know  For 15 years  Or 10 years  I didn't realize  He was talking about  Calling him 
[02:04:30]  Mr. McMahon  You know  So he was so into it  That I was like  What is he getting to?  You know  And his key line was  Yeah  You better  You know  I have a special club  And if you don't join that club  Somebody's getting fired  And so I went out  And I said  Vince  Look  I don't know  If you're aware of this  But you know  I've saved a lot of money  On clothes over the years  You know  I don't get many haircuts  I drive a used minivan  I don't need you  Or your stupid job  And then he said  No  Make you don't understand  I didn't say  You were getting fired  I said  Someone's getting fired 
[02:05:00]  And he said  I'm going to fire  Your friend Molina  And then she  Breaks out in tears  Like it's this weird world  Where like  You kind of know  What's happening  But I'm not expecting  Her to start crying  And she's going  I'm not worth it  Don't do it  And I gave this impassioned speech  That my wife got really hot about  Because in  What was our biggest  You know  Sticking point ever  I called my wife  When she was on a cruise  And this was after  I talked to Molina  Exactly twice  You know  I was kind of impressed by her 
[02:05:30]  And I was like  Clint you know what  You know that girl  I mentioned  Molina  You know  And she goes  Yeah I think so  The WWE girl  I said  What do you think about her  Being Huey's godmother  And  Oh my god  Dead silence  Like oh  I was like  Honestly I had this vision  From God  And I just thought  That would make sense  No  Apparently I ruined the cruise  And  Yeah  And my wife was not that fun  I thought  Well if I'm just  With this girl on TV  People are going to think  I'm hitting on her  Because that's what  You know guys do 
[02:06:00]  Wrestlers on TV  And I thought  You know what  In order to make my wife  Look good  I'll let people know  That you know  That's not the way  I feel about her  So I said on TV  You know  I'd only talked to you twice  When I asked my wife  If you could be my son  Huey's godmother  Never mentioned my wife  Cut that idea down  Saying what are you insane  Exactly  And so I went for the big kiss  And then I got fired anyway  Kiss my ass  And then he would just  Drop his pants  And you had to kiss his bare ass 
[02:06:30]  You're fired  He's amazing  I remember one of the great things  He said  He went up to me  And he said  Mick  This is on air  He might feel the same way  You know  In private as well  He goes  You know what  As a human being  You may not be bad  But as a businessman  You suck  He got like  The Hebrew K's in there  Here's some of my favorites 
[02:07:00]  You're fired  You're fired  Fly  Get on your hands and knees  Like a dog  That's it  Roll around like a dog  It's too much  You know  He's not that good of an actor  There's some  Realism  There's some rage in there  There's some realism  In those clips  He really gets involved  I asked  You remember the infamous  Bob Costas interview  Oh yeah 
[02:07:30]  Of course  He went off on Bob Costas  Leaned right into his face  Yeah  I mean  And Costas thought  He was going to kill him  And I said in the second book  Not that I'm here to plug my second book  I'm here to plug the current book  The Hardcore Diaries  And I said it was weird  Because like  If this was 1996  And I was talking  You know you guys  Or like a weather station  They would insist on us  Being a character  So I'd be here going  Tell you something  It's a nice day  And I'd sound like a jerk  It's no wonder  That people are like  Oh I don't want those stupid wrestlers  On the show  And so I said in the book  That it's ironic  That the guy 
[02:08:00]  Talking about Vince  Who made it acceptable  For guys like me  To be ourselves  On mainstream shows  Is the only guy  Who feels compelled  To become his wrestling character  When the light is on  And so I asked Vince  I said man  I said can I ask you something  He said yeah you sure  I said were you in character  On the Costas show  And he looked at me  And he said  I don't know  Like he lives in this  Never world  He doesn't know what's real anymore  He doesn't know  He doesn't know  If he's in character or not 
[02:08:30]  And I'll tell you one thing  From the book  And not that I'm here to plug  The book  The Hardcore Diaries  No you wouldn't do that  You're here just to hang  I would love to come back  Just to hang  To prove  Hey and you know  That I was looking for you guys  Right  Yes  I went out of my way  To give you a call  Back when  We found out who our real friends were  When we got fired  And we had to sit out  For two and a half years  Mick Foley was one of  One of a few  Just a few  That actually called  To make sure we were all right  It was everybody else  That was sitting out  For two and a half years 
[02:09:00]  I did man  I called my old publicist  I was like  Can you get a message  To those guys  Can I call them  And let them know  That was beyond cool  Actually  We feel for them  Well thank you  So you know  I'm not just here  For the plug  I would love to come back  On a more regular basis  But in this case  I kind of went out  When it was  I'm charting  The ECW  One night stand  Idea I had  And when it wasn't  Panning out  Like I thought it would  I became  A little bit of a  Conspiracy theorist  And I'm like  I think you guys  Are trying to tank 
[02:09:30]  This pay per view  On purpose  And that's a hell  Of a thing  To say to Vince  You know  And I kind of  I didn't put it  That boldly  I said  Vince we do want  This thing to be  Successful  Don't we  And he looked at me  And he goes  Mick  I may not be  A good person  But I'm always  A good businessman  And I shook his hand  And I said  Vince I said  I think you're wrong  I said  I think you are  A good person  And it was amazing  My nose grew  Like 8 inches  Immediately  But I remember that 
[02:10:00]  You know  There's these little moments  Of this side to Vince  That people don't see  And you know  Whether you hate him  Or think he's a great guy  Wrestlers have come  To the conclusion  That no matter  Who gets together  Or how long it takes  Eventually we'll start  Telling stories  About Vince  And laughing  Uproariously  So he's one of a kind  When he said  I'm a good businessman  Did you  Bring up XFL  That would have  I could have  That might have  Knocked him down 
[02:10:30]  A couple of pegs  Hey we believed  I'm sure  I'm sure he'd like  To like fire off  That men in black  Flashlight  Thing in people's faces  For that one  Don't remember a thing  I called the office  One day  Can I talk to Vince  You're like  No Vince  Is out of the office  Oh what's he doing  He's starting  A football league  He started like  The next week  It wasn't like  There was a lot  Of long time  Planning in here  How much work  Could it take  The biggest problem  With the XFL  We were involved  Obviously  Was trying to get 
[02:11:00]  People to sit  In Giant Stadium  In the middle  Of January  Early February  Like what are you  Thinking  This is the middle  Of winter  And I don't know  In retrospect  If bragging about  How little money  The guys made  Was the big draw  And it's like  Man if you see guys  Who are earning less  Than your plumber  You need to make  That January journey  To Giant Stadium  To see them in action  But you know something  When all is said and done  The NFL wound up  Picking up a few  Of the things  That Vince was doing 
[02:11:30]  Like those camera views  Yeah definitely  On the field  It was really like  The camera was right  There on the field  Now the deal with  Now the NFL  Actually has that  You know  Very complicated  Wiring system  Where the camera  Is you know  Behind the huddle  Whereas XFL  Had a guy  On the field  With pads on  Holding a goddamn camera  Remember that  Remember the  Steadicam guys  They'd be dressed  Like gladiators  Going out there  Going I'm screwed  How the hell  You get that gig  Right in the middle  Of the action  On the sideline  They had a camera guy 
[02:12:00]  Running down  Who'd you piss off  To get that gig  I forgot all about  Put on the pads  You're going in  I'm a cameraman  What the hell  Are you doing to me  Yeah he's nuts  Let's take a few calls  Before we gotta  Move over to XM  It's Fat Jack  From the Bronx  Fat Jack  Yeah what's up man  How you guys doing  What's up  I love your freaking show  Man you guys are hilarious  Well some people  Thank you  Mr. Fat Jack  Steve Harvey  I'm black  Steve Harvey is an ass  Alright thank you  Mick Foley I love you man  You're my favorite wrestler man  You guys are the last day

[02:14:30]  It's gotten around  Our dressing room  Where J.R.  Had been interviewing me  For the WWE website  And asked me about  The Molina thing  And why they didn't  Follow up on it  And we speculated  It might be  Because Vince McMahon  Just couldn't conceive  You know he just  Couldn't buy into  A concept where a man  And a woman  Were friends  Like that's  That's like  You know what is  The point to a guy  Like Vince  And so I  Were to use it  Throwing the word  Platonic around  And then J.R.  Asked me about  You know ECW  And I said  Oh there's some good things  I liked it  You know you couldn't  Just make it 
[02:15:00]  A nostalgia show  I liked the originals  Versus the new breed  And I said  I gotta tell you  I like that vampire girl  Ariel in a weird  Non-platonic way  That's all I said  And all of a sudden  When I show up  In the dressing room  It's like  Oh Mick likes  The vampire check  Of course he does  Yeah  Alright listen  That's our music  We have to get out of here  What are we promoting  Today Mick  Oh  Fan access  Fan access  That's right  It's going on all day  But I'll be there  At the South Street  Streetport  From 5 to 7  Signing anything you want  Including copies

[02:21:30]  And here we are at XM Satellite Radio.  I guess Mick Foley doesn't take a hint.  We must be really good actors or something. 
[02:22:00]  I don't know what's going on here.  Come on over, Mick.  And I detected just the slightest hint of disingenuineness.  Did I get that word right?  I thought, hey, hell, they've got a hell of a big audience.  I don't care if they don't want me there.  I'm going to plug my book a couple times.  And you got your book.  Yeah, it's there somewhere.  Hardcore diaries.  When we first met Mick Foley, Anthony and I were definitely into the wrestling thing.  We did a lot with the WWF when it was called the WWF to the point where Vince McMahon invited us to do the pregame for the XFL. 
[02:22:30]  So we had a really good relationship with you guys.  But what I liked about you was you could just hang.  A lot of the guys we interviewed is wrestling or nothing.  Yes.  And then we would get the business out of the way with you.  And then you would just hang and tell some great stories and just have a really good time on our show.  So, of course, we want you over here, Mick.  I appreciate that.  Hey, we got to say hi to Happy Typing Girl.  It's her birthday today.  Got to acknowledge me.  Happy Typing Girl's birthday.  As you said that, I was thinking of her probably about a minute ago.  Really?  Wow, what creepy timing that is. 
[02:23:00]  Yeah, it is creepy.  But it's her birthday.  And she's an Uber fan, Mick.  She does so much for us.  It's not even funny.  She is one of the greatest.  It's her birthday?  It's her birthday.  Happy birthday.  Happy birthday.  Waiting for my camera stuff to download.  So I actually got a new computer here.  Right here.  New computer.  New Pal Talk.  Been downloaded.  And I got to download the camera drivers.  And then we'll all be on camera again.  Everything will be fine like it was.  I got an observation.  Sam, why are you still filming him? 
[02:23:30]  Wow.  You don't need this much film of Mick Foley.  You need every angle so you can make a sculpture.  Is it going to be like Lionel Richie's hello video?  One of my responsibilities here is to film big celebrities we get in so we can later.  You've been filming him for over an hour.  But you need a good amount of footage to condense it down to a really strong two to three minutes.  Yeah.  How about I just give you a strong two to three minutes now?  And then you put the fucking camera down. 
[02:24:00]  You're making this sound creepier than it is.  No.  It's creepy.  By the way, Mick, you should get to know your fan here, young Sam.  We have an observation that Steve brought to the table.  We are convinced that his skull is filled with candy.  Because such a sweet-looking boy has to have a head full of candy.  No.  I'm sure you like candy, right?  We twist his ear and we pull on his jaw.  There's got to be a mechanism to get it out.  That releases the candy.  We smack him on the back of his head.  But we haven't found a way to get the candy out yet. 
[02:24:30]  There's no way to get the candy.  There's no candy in my head.  Are you sure, though?  Yes, of course I'm sure.  Get some candy out of his head, E-Rock.  No, E-Rock can't get it.  No, Steve does it.  Steve, get some candy.  Watch.  He taps the back of his head.  No candy falls out of the mouth.  Come on.  A juju pee, a milk dud, something.  Just give up one.  Squeeze his nose.  Just give up one.  Oh, you got a little mucus.  Just give up one piece of candy for Mick Foley, for your hero.  I don't have any candy.  There's no candy in your head.  Why are the cheeks so rosy and impressive?  It doesn't make any sense.  All right.  What do you got, Steve? 
[02:25:00]  Any new ways to get the candy out?  I'm really going along with my bone saw theory.  You just want to saw the top of his head off?  I just want to saw the top of his head off and put a hinge on the back and open it like  a candy dick.  I don't understand why his theory has lasted longer than a week.  Because it's true.  And you're a stingy candy hoarding little boy.  All right.  We got Shwuggy on the line.  Big fan.  Shwuggy.  Hey, boo-boo boys.  Good morning.  Hey, Matt.  Mick, I got a question for you.  Yes.  And knowing you, you'll be honest with this.  Okay.  WWE, over the last few months, has done very well. 
[02:25:30]  Yes.  Getting some interest back, some very good storylines, ratings are up.  I agree.  In your opinion, how much of this is because Triple H is out and not really controlling  things?  You know what?  I think, honestly, the Triple H thing with DX was great and did get the ball rolling.  And I think what you will see is that when he comes back, he'll probably be hotter than  ever.  I don't mean physically, like, oh, Triple H is that hot in his career.  Let me just clarify.  And I think, you know, it did wonders for Shawn Michaels because it gave him a chance to do 
[02:26:00]  some, like, light-hearted comedy and then establish himself once again as a serious main event  guy.  So, no, I don't think that had anything to do with it.  But you don't think the fact that, I mean, it's, the stories are legendary.  You're apparently not going with my answer.  Yeah, he really wants you to change your answer to, yes.  I got to give a little back history here.  I remember now, Shwoogie is obsessed with Triple H controlling the WWE because of his  involvement with Vince's daughter. 
[02:26:30]  Well, they're married now.  And have a kid, right?  Yes.  Well, yes.  Not in, not on camera.  It's funny because everybody knows it's true.  Right.  And Triple H will, like, wink at it.  They'll be like, I don't know who that father is, but he's got to be hung like that.  And then they'll cut him off.  And the crowd laughs along.  It's a joke that everybody's in on.  Yeah.  But they won't reveal it on camera.  It's one of those weird things.  Like, you can have make-believe, you know, children on our show.  Yeah.  You know, married couples who aren't really married.  But here is a couple that is married and, you know, they will not admit it. 
[02:27:00]  I imagine they will somewhere down the line.  All right.  Did I evade that question?  That's good.  Thanks, guys.  All right.  Okay.  All right, Shwoogie.  Yeah, he calls all the time and just has nothing nice to say about Triple H, man.  We love Triple H, actually.  He gave a girl the best spanking we've ever seen.  Really?  Wow.  A girl name.  I even remember her name and everything.  Peaches.  Didn't she get brought in by, uh...  This was before he was married.  Before he was married to Vince's daughter.  Hey, you know what?  Excuse me.  You guys are on XM, right?  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  I can curse.  You know I don't curse, right? 
[02:27:30]  What's your favorite curse, by the way?  We know your favorite holiday is Christmas.  Yes.  Well, you know what I find?  And, like, when it comes to curse words, it reminds me of a story about Jack Nicholson,  not Nicholas, because there's a story about me meeting Jack Nicholson, the golfer.  That's not the guy I'm talking about, Jack Nicholson.  And it was in England after Batman had wrapped, and they were at the post-Batman party, and  a guy came up to him, a girl came up to him, and said, Mr. Nicholson, can't you dance?  And he looked at her and he said, wrong verb. 
[02:28:00]  And I thought, man, well, that's great.  So my idea, you know, when you use the big word, the curse word, like, so many of the  wrestlers use it as, like, an empty, you know, adjective.  Like, all right, you know, I shot him into the effing ropes, and I hit him with the big  effing foot, I dropped the effing elbow on him.  I'm a firm believer that when you pop that word, use that word, you use it as a strong  action verb, and you use it sparingly.  So therefore, you know, when I use it once in a while in the Foley bedroom, it carries  considerable weight. 
[02:28:30]  But I will curse for you guys in just a second, all right?  Yeah, but keep talking as I try to find this story.  Well, I want to let Jimmy know his favorite holiday is Christmas, and you still have a  room in your house that's always Christmas all the time?  I do, yeah.  Aren't the kids starting to look at you like, come on, Dad, this is lame.  We're teenagers now, man.  They've been looking at me like that for a long time.  But it was supposed to be my sanctuary.  It's like where I wrote most of this book, you know, and it's supposed to be my room.  At one point, I'd even lock it when I left.  What do you have in the Christmas room, though?  You know, I've got some nice framed Santa Claus artwork. 
[02:29:00]  Do you have Santa Claus tied up in there?  But I would like to be Santa Claus one day.  I would, you know.  You can pull that off.  Yeah, you can see that, right?  You're jolly.  Yeah.  I'm actually going to, now that the heat is off the French a little bit, I'm going to  pick up some French so about 10, 15 years from now, I can be Santa at Santa's Village  in Jefferson, New Hampshire.  That's not a joke, by the way.  That is my life's ambition.  Is it?  Yeah.  So I've got the room.  It still has goals.  I like that.  But it's become like the all-purpose. 
[02:29:30]  How do you tell your five-year-old he can't play his video games in there, you know?  And how do you tell the four-year-old he can't, like, do his artwork and play with his action  figures?  The only problem is my four- and six-year-old are under the impression that I sucked as  a wrestler.  Like, they can't conceive, you know, they see guys like Batiste and Triple H, and they  can't conceive how a guy who looks like me could hang with them.  Oh, no, boy.  And I finally, you know, I was, like, telling my wife, I was like, this is, you know, this  is starting to hurt me a little bit.  You know, they've got the action figure, they've got me on the video game, so I said, you know, 
[02:30:00]  I'm going to go downstairs, I'm going to prove it, because I remember when I won the title  from The Rock at the end of 98, that my older kids, who are now 13 and 15, you know, they  were literally dancing around the room, they were so happy, and then I pulled the belt  out, and they had the belt.  So I figured this is going to be the same thing, just, you know, eight, nine years later.  And I put on the DVD, me, you know, battling The Rock, and my kids start cheering for The  Rock.  And, like, they don't, you know, they haven't conceived of the idea that wrestling, you know,  it's not an out-and-out, you know, mortal struggle for life, and so I'm like, my kids 
[02:30:30]  want me to get hurt.  And even then, after that, I thought, okay, I'll show them the match with Triple H from  the Garden, and my four-year-old's going, I want Triple A to win.  I want Triple A to win.  How depressing.  Wow, that is really sad.  Those are sad stories, Nick.  I know.  All right, can I drop the F-word on you guys?  Oh, yeah.  All right, let me just give you a little background, okay?  I'm at a show, and I...  By the way, you have to go, so you...  No, I do, I do, okay. 
[02:31:00]  Your guys, you're freaking out.  I'm going to drop one F-bomb, and then I'll be out of here, okay?  Let him drop his F-bomb, and then I'll be out of here, okay?  All right, F-bomb.  Get him out of here.  I want to meet Batman, who's at a, you know, a science fiction convention, but I'm getting worried  because the fans are coming back, and they're hanging their head down, and they're like,  oh, Batman's being a dick.  He won't look up when he signs.  He won't sign stuff that Robin's...  Which Batman is this?  This is Adam West.  Okay.  Because apparently, you know, Burt Ward wrote kind of an expose that made maybe a West come  off a little bit bad, and I thought, man, you know, my kids love, they love Batman. 
[02:31:30]  Like, I wanted to get something signed, and I wanted to show them that I wrote something  cool about him and have a nice day.  And so, okay, just trying to find it.  Okay.  There it is.  Okay.  So, as I get to the line, I'm really worried.  Like, if he makes me look bad, it'll be like trying to watch Hogan's Heroes after you find  out that Bob Crane was a porn addict, or watching a Knicks game when you know that Marv Albert  had that clothing fetish, you know, girls' clothing fetish, or watching Dancing with the  Stars when you know that Stacey was intimate with Tess, and I'm worried about that happening, 
[02:32:00]  you know?  And as I get up there, fortunately, Adam West's manager goes,  I said, wow, Mick, you've sold quite a few copies of that book.  And I was like, yeah, I did.  He's like, Adam, this is Mick Foley.  He's written a couple bestsellers.  And I'm like, yes, sir, Mr. West, and I'd like to show you a little something that's  in there about you and the effect you had, not only on me and my children.  And he starts reading it, and he's reading it out loud, you know, but he's not giving  me any feedback.  And I'm like, man, I'm looking for feedback from Adam West.  When he finishes his thing, he goes, he's rifling through the book, and he goes to the front 
[02:32:30]  page, and if you remember, you know, Have a Nice Day, had that unique opening.  And here's Batman.  You have to remember the voice, right?  He goes, I can't believe I lost my fucking ear.  Batman, reading my book.  And then he turns to me and he says, you've got a very dynamic writing style.  Captures the reader right away.  And then he signed it for no charge.  He signed his autobiography.  And while the rest of the guys were walking around, they're like going, oh, Batman's a 
[02:33:00]  dick.  I walked away.  I was like, Batman, rule.  All right, listen, I have to go.  Where are you going?  I have to go.  TV?  Do some of the...  I tried telling the...  I saw you earlier.  I saw you on TV behind the CW show.  I'm like, hey, look, there's Mick.  I mean, I'm doing the math in the car, and I'm like, okay, all these other stations combined  add up to about a tenth of O&A's audience.  Can't we just stay there?  We'll just do one.  But apparently that's not in the cards, so I've got to run around and tuck it.  You guys are panicking.  He is panicking.  Blackberry and everything.  All right.  Well, we'll be a few minutes late. 
[02:33:30]  Get out there, pick up the Hardcore Diaries by Mick Foley on the bestseller list.  It is, yeah.  Yeah, great.  A lot of nice pictures in here, too.  I love the pictures.  Nice one in Candace.  A couple nice Molina photos.  Yeah.  Opie said before, your writing style's really good.  Appreciate it.  No, I enjoyed two of your books.  I only read two, so it wasn't like the other ones.  I just didn't read yet.  Okay.  Rifle through this when you have a chance.  I was on vacation and went through one of your books in a week. 
[02:34:00]  It was his writing.  On the beach, right?  Yeah.  His writing was unbelievable, and you just wrote it all out longhand.  You're just like the Foley family at Walt Disney World with your son over here making  his face.  That's hysterical.  He was in that period where that's all he ever did.  Even when he took the school portraits, they're like, Mr. Foley, he's going to pull you out  of here.  We couldn't get your son to smile.  He kept making it.  It would be like his Power Rangers pose.  Yeah.  So his portrait is like, bam.  He's got his tongue on it.  That's hysterical.  All right, guys.  I've got to run.  All right, Mick.  Thanks a lot.  Appreciate it.  Thank you. 
[02:34:30]  See you, Mick.  Thank you.  Are you on TV?  Because our listeners will turn us off to watch on TV for a little bit.  No, no.  They don't care.  But I have a major announcement to make the day after WrestleMania.  What the hell is that?  Wow.  What a tease.  Why don't you give us the major announcement?  That would kind of ruin it for the rest of the audience.  Who cares?  Who cares?  How about a hint?  It involves Vince.  Vince's ass.  Ew.  All right.  There you go.  Vince and Vince's ass. 
[02:35:00]  There you go.  Mick Foley, everyone.  Very cool.  One of the good ones, Mick.  He's a nice fella.  He is.  Otto's here.  Otto.  Otto's here.  Where's Otto?  Otto.  There's a whole collection of people out there.  Yeah.  This whole crew is supposed to help us out on the other side, but they're all laid.  And this is turning into like a live show.  It's just, there's audience members out there like every day now.  Well, these are all people you know, though.  There's only one audience member today.  The creep in the wow hat.  Yeah, we knew. 
[02:35:30]  Oh, he's a good boy.  You didn't have to wave your hand.  We spied you a mile away, bro.  All right.  So once again, happy birthday to happy typing girl.  We'll take a quick break.  It's also Travis's birthday.  Oh, two.  Oh, two little girls having a birthday today.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh, that's adorable.  Why don't you two trade like makeup secrets and do fun girl stuff, play with dolls.  It's not his birthday, is it?  I don't know what dolls.  It is his birthday?  Happy birthday, guys.  What does happy typing girl do for fun?  Folds laundry. 
[02:36:00]  Yeah.  We know that.  Ties sweaters around her neck.  All she does is dress wholesome.  It bugs me.  Yeah.  It should be a new year for her.  I want filthy see-through bikinis.  Mesh white bikini bottoms.  I don't think you're going to get that.  We're going to take a quick break.  When we get back, we got Lily Tomlin being a potty mouth.  Oh, I like her.  White the potty mouth.  We got BJ audio.  I don't know if we want to play this for everybody.  Oh, that guy stinks.  Yes, he did stink.  And that's why maybe we should play it.  And where was that other 911 call? 
[02:36:30]  We got...  Okay, I got it.  We got some great audio to play today.  That's what we will be doing over here today.  Over here.  Who just showed up?  What?  Who just showed up?  Otto.

LL's Kenny.  Philly's own Kenny.  Happy birthday to Kenny.  Oh, uh, Kenny I know. 
[02:39:00]  How do you know him?  I'm thinking, uh, Brother Kenny.  My girlfriend's Brother Kenny.  Brother, yes, I'm saying.  LL's Kenny.  What's LL?  I ain't saying.  Wait, wait, but that's not, that's not her, it's her first name, but what's the other?  It might be an adverb or so, or like an adjective, or one of those things.  Yeah.  Like a, like a noun.  Just tell me this.  Is the name first or second?  Oh, that's good.  Uh, I'm not, I, I.  Oh, it's just first or second.  That's fair.  Because then there's going to be a whole thread as they try to figure that one out. 
[02:39:30]  They will anyway.  It's first.  The name's first.  All right, good.  Second.  Good.  Fuck.  That's what I had.  I know you thought you did.  What's up, Otto?  Hi, guys.  You got stuck in traffic.  I'm terribly sorry.  I left at 5.30, man.  I, I had a ham sandwich and went to bed very early and my fat friend, James, was glad  to pick me up right on time.  There you go, James.  5.30 was pick up.  Silch.  What the fuck?  Where have you guys been? 
[02:40:00]  Just, it was just crawling along.  It was a fucking living hell.  That, you know, that turnpike.  It was just awful.  How far do you live from the city?  I live, uh, you know, about a half hour south of here.  That's it, right?  It's a nightmare.  That's why.  Terrible.  It sucks.  That's why I gave up on, yep, on the, uh, the commute.  Nothing I can do.  There's no good time to leave to get here.  You know, three in the morning and then go to a diner for seven hours.  Yeah, I'll tell you when, yeah, four.  Yeah.  Like, that's when I leave.  Around there, 4.30-ish.  Yeah.  Anthony, because we've, uh, 20 minutes.  We've switched the time of this show.  Yeah.  Over the last couple of years, you know, we started at, uh, seven for a while. 
[02:40:30]  Now we're back at six.  Yeah.  And when, uh, when we moved to seven for a while, it was like, what a difference in the traffic.  And he was leaving at 5.15 in the morning, whatever it was.  Yeah.  5.15 in the morning, there's a traffic jam getting into the city.  What is that about?  It's never going to end.  Ridiculous.  Ridiculous.  Yeah.  So you must be on edge, huh?  I mean, you know, I'm okay.  This is, this is fine.  I mean, I'm doing this thing with Twitchels and his other freaking.  I know.  We want you over there. 
[02:41:00]  Stammering friend over there.  More people hear you over there.  Fucking nerve damage.  Oh, Big A?  Yeah, yeah.  You don't like the Big A?  No, he's great.  He's a cab driver.  I was just talking to him.  Yeah.  He looks like Paul Bearer.  Yeah.  You want Big A in here?  Yeah, of course.  All right, Big A, get in here for a second.  Big A.  Yeah.  Cody from Louisiana.  Why do you guys play commercials?  I don't know.  So, so we can maybe, you know, take a piss.  What's your problem?  We can't talk for five straight hours or XM wise to, you know, whatever. 
[02:41:30]  A little over two hours.  A little over two.  Relax yourself.  So we have to play commercials so we can do, you know, things like take a leak and jump  and stuff.  What's up, Big A?  How are you?  How are ya?  You like looking at other people's cards.  Yeah.  A 10 for Big A to match his IQ.  Big A, you kind of need to shave. 
[02:42:00]  He said it, not me.  Why are you looking at me?  You growing a beard?  Are ya?  Sometimes I just want to have, you know, the rugged look.  Yeah.  The rugged look.  Yeah.  Hey.  The rugged look.  Big A.  Big A.  He's a cool guy with the rugged look.  Josie.  Josie Wales.  Yeah.  That's what he.  Blue whales.  I'm teasing, of course.  It's just a little weight thing.  That's all. 
[02:42:30]  You sure get a lot of beard.  Yeah.  You got like a lot of face.  Your beard starts at your chest or something.  Wow.  Very handsome.  What is that on your face?  Razors.  What's it called?  Like when it gets like that?  Yeah.  You know.  Razor.  You know, it's you shave, but it grew in a day or two.  Now it's razor.  Rhymes with bubble.  Razor what?  You know.  I don't know.  Here you go.  What is it?  Rhymes with bubble? 
[02:43:00]  Razor.  Razor.  Razor.  Razor.  Us.  Us.  Bubble.  Bubble.  Oh, ow.  Bubble.  It sounded like it hurt when it finally came out.  Bubble.  Guys are terrible.  Why are we terrible?  This is great.  We got this all day.  Fuck.  Yeah.  Well, yeah.  I'm just saying, you know, that's a lot of beard.  If you grew a full beard, that fucker would look like an Afghan.  Be big.  Don't look at me. 
[02:43:30]  He's saying it.  Big A with a big beard.  That look of yours is downright creepy.  He's from the Bronx, my fifth favorite burrow.  Jimmy, did he fart again?  No.  Yes, he did.  I heard it.  Big A, did he fart?  You're lying.  When?  I heard it.  Otto?  What?  20 minutes ago.  No, no, yes.  Well, I'm just kidding.  I know.  I'm sure about right now.  20 minutes ago.  Yeah, but not now.  Not anything that would still be lingering.  I'm teasing.  I wish they lingered like that.  I just got a whiff.  Oh. 
[02:44:00]  Hey, you want to?  I pray that's one.  Let's get into the Lily Tomlin thing.  Yeah.  This is just terrific.  What did that snatch liquor do now?  Is she?  Is she?  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  I was getting very good.  Dyke.  Yeah.  You never know that.  The haircut is very feminine.  Is it?  Yeah.  Also, happy birthday to Club Soda Andrew.  He's 21 today.  What's going on with our listeners having the birthday on the same day?  He's a huge fan.  That's from Steve from Bayshore.  All right.  The Lily Tomlin.  It's from I Heart Huckabees. 
[02:44:30]  Yeah.  Yeah.  What?  Remember the movie I Heart Huckabees?  Is that Gene Hackman or Dustin Hoffman?  Yeah, Dustin Hoffman.  They're all like the same movie.  All those late recent Bill Murray movies.  Yeah.  They're good, but they're all the same or something.  Same thing.  Yeah.  And it was an argument that she was having with the director.  What's his name?  David O. Russell.  Yeah.  David O. Russell.  And this guy apparently directed like Three Kings. 
[02:45:00]  Three Kings.  Then there was Three Kings.  I Heart Huckabees.  Yeah.  That could be the worst movie title in the fucking history.  The title alone makes me never want to even fucking pass it on the channels when I'm changing it.  What's a Huckabee?  I don't know.  What was your hardest, town?  And it wasn't like, you know, like, you know, the I Love New York.  It's like the I Heart New York. 
[02:45:30]  You don't say I Heart New York.  You say I Love New York.  Yeah.  But everyone says I Heart Huckabees instead of I Love Huckabees.  And that's annoyed me.  That's right.  And that's the reason I won't ever see it.  No.  Stupid fucking title for an unbelievable movie.  Oh, it's dumb.  Jesus.  It's also Rosie O'Donnell's birthday.  Whose birthday?  Rosie O'Donnell.  Oh.  Spread them out a little bit here.  Yeah.  There's a couple other people, too.  Yeah, we'll do the birthday thing.  We're not doing birthday things today.  Why?  We do a whole feature.  It's a new feature I suggested.  Shout out birthdays. 
[02:46:00]  It kills us 45 minutes.  We just yell out funny things to people on their birthday.  We're going to do the birthday thing.  So, Lily Tomlin and David O'Russell have their respective blowouts on the set of I Heart Huckabees.  Yeah.  We start with Lily Tomlin at a desk giving, giving it, what?  That's my bet.  What is that supposed to say?  I forgot some words.  Oh, all right.  Whatever.  It'll be obvious.  She's sitting at a desk.  Yes.  Apparently, he was giving her some direction, which was contradictory to what she had been 
[02:46:30]  told before, or she goes through a whole big, long scene, and then he tells her, hey,  I want that a little different.  Now, I don't know who's right or who's wrong here.  He's the fucking director.  You got to listen to the director.  But she's also Lily Tomlin.  But she's Lily Tomlin.  So, you know, but if she's being a cunt, then what do you do?  You're a director.  You tell, you got to keep your fucking, your crew straightened out.  You can't let, you can't let these prima donnas get, get the best of you, or you look 
[02:47:00]  like a bad guy, and you won't get any fucking respect on the set.  Hey, Brando wouldn't let Frank Oz direct him in, uh, what was the movie they did with  De Niro?  I understand Lily Tomlin's been around for a while.  Some heist movie, right?  Yeah.  But don't compare her with fucking De Niro.  By the way, um, or Brando.  Someone's yelling at him.  He wouldn't take direction.  No, he wouldn't let him.  De Niro had to direct the scene.  Someone's yelling at us on the instant feedback, Jim in Philly.  This bit, it's in capital letters. 
[02:47:30]  This bit was on Ron and Fez yesterday at noon, you jackasses.  Yeah.  Guess what?  I didn't listen to Ron and Fez yesterday.  I'm sorry.  And not everyone that listens to our show was listening to Ron and Fez.  You stupid, self-centered cocksucker.  How the fuck, just because you heard it on Ron and Fez means everyone did and we shouldn't  play it, right?  How about we take five minutes of phone calls from people that did not hear this yet?  Let's do that.  Oh, you monkey fucker.  God, I hate people.  Enough with the complaining. 
[02:48:00]  All right.  And every fucking turn, less complaining.  You know what?  I heard it on Ron and Fez yesterday.  So believe me, we know Ron and Fez played it.  But who cares?  This is our fucking show.  I want to play it so we can comment on it.  Who sent that in?  That was fucking, that was, what was that?  That's Fez from NY.  Yeah.  Fez from retard island.  All right.  Well, here we go.  Here's Lily Tomlin going off.  And take your legs off the desk and a whole bunch of other stuff.  I don't see the mall that says you've got to keep it, so you can take your legs down, 
[02:48:30]  too.  We could buy some.  Okay, for Christ's sake, let's just take it one fucking line at a time instead of changing  everything.  It's very difficult to even create what you're going to do when it's constant, a barrage of  change this, change this, do this, do this.  No, wait, wait.  Do it a different way.  Do it a different way.  Don't get me started.  Okay.  Okay, so I'm just saying, let's just, you know, it's impossible.  One actor's doing one thing, another actor's doing another, and I'm not, I'm not as, I'm 
[02:49:00]  not as brilliant as you.  I can't keep up with you.  No, but we're being very efficient.  We're being very efficient?  Being patient with you.  Let's rehearse.  You're being impatient.  Well, I'm impatient.  Let's rehearse.  I couldn't understand you.  It's not the first time.  Wow.  And they're making a comedy, right?  Yeah, yeah.  Oh, wow.  See, to me, even though it's Lily Tomlin, that's kind of being fucked up right there.  Like, regardless of how this guy's directing or whatever, she should just fucking do her 
[02:49:30]  job.  Maybe she was, and maybe his direction is annoying.  You don't know what led up to that.  Like, for instance, when I'm on a set, if someone says to me to do something else, I'll immediately  put my foot down and go, I'm the actor!  I was actually looking at Jimmy Sirius like, what do you do?  I'm the actor.  I don't know.  I think of the director as the captain of the ship. 
[02:50:00]  Exactly.  And if the fucking, he steers it into the rocks, that's his fucking problem.  Maybe he's rambling about his fucking keys for strawberries and Lily doesn't want to  listen anymore.  Lily Tomlin is fucking dyke.  She wants my strawberries.  She wants these two balls in a cunt.  Yeah, why would he go after her just for the hell of it, when he's trying to make a comedy?  Yeah, because now there's nothing funny going to be done that day, now that he's annoyed.  It seems like maybe he is a little off with the getting, like she was doing something, 
[02:50:30]  and she gets it done, and then he makes her change it, and change it again, and she probably  gets sick of it.  But that's, isn't that part of fucking movie making?  Maybe the guy director thinks, hey, I want it done a little different this way.  Take your feet off the fucking desk, or move some of that shit around, we'll do it again.  There are directors that do 50 fucking takes sometimes.  Let me see this twat work with Kubrick.  I know he's dead, but, you know, the guy took fucking 800 takes of a goddamn shot.  Well, he's Kubrick. 
[02:51:00]  Yeah.  You know, what are you going to tell him?  But again, then she's not giving him respect because he's not Kubrick.  Right.  He's the fucking director.  By the way.  Yeah.  Because that guy decided to yell at us.  Yeah.  We punished the whole audience.  Hmm.  What happened?  That guy, Jim.  Yeah.  Said he heard this on Ron and Fez yesterday.  Uh-huh.  All right, so, instead of playing more Lily Tomlin, we're going to play this for everybody.  Now we make everybody suffer.  Okay.  Everybody suffers now. 
[02:51:30]  Everyone pays.  And whoever's left will get to hear the rest of the Lily Tomlin.  Thank you, Jim.  This is for you.  Good morning.  Okay.  This is a train again.  Deep throat may be out.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh. 
[02:52:00]  Oh, yeah.  Can you see, look at my balls?  Mm-hmm.  It's like big A.  Yeah.  Oh, God.  Oh, God.  Yeah.  Would you?  Suck it up.  Yeah.  Oh, fuck.  Deep throat may.  Oh, my God. 
[02:52:30]  Oh, Lily.  Lily.  Oh, my God.  It fucking feels so good.  Oh, my God.  Oh, fuck, baby.  Oh, God.  Swallow that dick.  Swallow it.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  I don't know, baby. 
[02:53:00]  Oh, fuck, yeah.  Oh, my God.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Suck it up.  I hate that cock.  Yeah.  It's picking hard.  Suck it up, balls.  Oh, yeah.  Let's say something fucking retarded.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Nice to go. 
[02:53:30]  Duh.  Yeah.  Come on.  Oh, God.  Oh, shit.  Oh.  You gagging on that cock?  Yeah.  You gagging on that big fucking cock?  Yeah.  Oh, fuck.  Right in your throat. 
[02:54:00]  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, fuck, yeah.  I feel it all the way in my throat.  I do.  Yeah.  Oh, God damn.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Great big fat person.  Oh.  Oh, my God.  Oh. 
[02:54:30]  That wet sound is her fingering his shitty asshole.  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Sticky crap on her finger.  Yeah, he just took a nice stew shit.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Oh.  Oh.  James Gumm and Frederica Bimmel, the early years.  Like when I put those diamonds in your back?  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Jeff the gay guy.  This is suffering.  Nice.  Thanks, Opie.  Fuck.  Oh, yeah. 
[02:55:00]  Oh, yeah.  That'll be in your head all day.  Oh, yeah.  Disgusting.  That's just some random fucking blowjob audio.  Yeah, some listener decided to throw himself under the bus and send that in.  Oh, yeah.  Don't make us play the five-minute version of fucking MacBook Karaoke today.  That disaster of a segment today.  Anyone else pipes up, you get five minutes of that awful guy singing.  That's right.  Singing that meatloaf song.  Don't tempt me. 
[02:55:30]  All right.  Back to the jackasses.  For everyone that's left.  Now we've cleared the pallet.  So after the Lily Tomlin tirade there, she was kind of, you know, kind of getting a little  pissed at the director.  The director finally just loses it on her.  Just fucking loses his mind.  And he is knocking props all over the place.  Yeah.  And just really pissed off.  Well, this is the one where she's in the car, right?  Is it?  Yeah. 
[02:56:00]  Oh, you're doing that?  Yeah.  Sorry.  You're jumping around?  Well, it's the next track.  I know what you're talking about.  But the next one is Lily in a car.  She gets so pissed off, she starts telling everyone to fuck themselves, including Dustin  Hoffman, who's in the car with her.  Yeah, sitting right next to her.  Doing the scene.  By the way, man, we got funny listeners.  Henry Crinkle from Manhattan.  This is punishment?  Cool.  I'm going to come.  I'm going to come.  Oh, this is a big movie with Dustin Hoffman?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  It went nowhere, though.  But I mean, it's still a...  Who saw this?  Is this the Huckabees movie?  Oh, it deserved to go nowhere. 
[02:56:30]  Okay.  Did they do that movie, Midnight Something?  Yeah.  All right, you ready?  Here we go.  Lily in a car.  Leave me the fuck alone!  Do you know what the fuck is going on, period?  Fuck you!  I've had it up to here.  Who's reacting to what, for God's sakes?  Fuck you, motherfucker.  Fuck you, fuck you, fuck you. 
[02:57:00]  Get the fucking thing together.  Fuck you.  Oh, yeah, bullshit.  That's why we spent five or six fucking hours doing something else.  No!  God damn it!  You fucked it up, god damn you!  Now get straight on it and help.  If you can't help them, help me!  That's right, fuck you too! 
[02:57:30]  No, I'm not, I'm not, I'm sorry.  You don't get out, don't get out.  I'll break the fucking set apart.  I don't even give a fuck.  That's what I meant, because you're there.  Oh, shut up.  Shut the, you shut the fuck up too.  I will be the distributor.  Shoot the fucking thing right now.  Oh, yeah, you'll get, you'll get, I'll be angry as she's angry.  That'll be good.  No, he's a riot.  Yeah, it's just Dustin Hoffman.  Just shoot, shoot the fucking thing.  Oh, I will, I will shut the fuck up.  Oh, shut up.  I can't believe I gotta listen to this cunt, Tom. 
[02:58:00]  Oh, man.  Fuck you too, you fucking...  Oh.  Do we know the back history here?  Why does he gotta listen to that fucking bitch?  Yeah.  No surprise, the movie went nowhere.  He's an icon.  Yeah.  But what's the back history?  She went into Ratso Rizzo again.  What are you fighting about?  She was doing a scene in the car, and Hoffman was there.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Oh, that's pretty much it.  That's all I know.  Apparently, I knew halfway through that.  As he was making this movie, the director intentionally tried to make it very tense around the set. 
[02:58:30]  Like, oh, is that what they're trying to say now?  That's what I've read in some article.  Or maybe they wanted her to quit.  Maybe they realized that, you know, it was a mistake having her.  Well, I think they're both being assholes.  What's her great contribution anyway?  Laugh-In sucked.  It was lame, wasn't it?  Ronan Martin's Laugh-In.  Yeah.  She was good.  Prior loved her.  She was good.  Like, a sketch show.  Prior won an Emmy writing for her.  I mean, like, that's her.  I remember.  35 years ago, she did something once back when. 
[02:59:00]  I remember once on Laugh-In, there were two flies, and they were talking to each other.  And one said, hey, your man's open.  And I actually remember that from Laugh-In.  Yeah.  Hey, oof, oof, oof.  You bet you're bippy.  Oh, my God.  Suck it to me.  Reading from Whackbag.  So I wasn't completely listening.  So Lily Tomlin yelled at the director, then gave him a sloppy blowjob.  Yeah, right?  What the fuck? 
[02:59:30]  Mixing the clips up.  Yeah, if you're half listening, it makes it a little more fun.  All right.  So that's what we know?  Yeah.  I'm just reading this quick article.  And there's video of this, right?  We're just playing the audio.  It's on YouTube.  It keeps getting yanked.  Yeah, they keep yanking it, but it's up there.  And then someone else throws it up there.  Yeah.  They're trying to make it go viral.  Now, the director just loses his fucking shit.  He's storming around the set.  And there is a funny part, actually. 
[03:00:00]  Oh, did you hear it?  Because Dave brought it up yesterday on Ron and Fez's show.  I thought it was really funny.  What?  The director gets all pissed off.  He's screaming.  He's throwing shit.  And then he walks behind the camera.  So, you know, he comes toward what you're looking at.  And he disappears behind the camera.  And you can still hear him yelling, yelling, yelling.  And then he shows up walking through a side prop door back on the set again.  So it's like he disappeared and just came popping through a doorway.  Much like laughing, where they would open up those doors. 
[03:00:30]  Hey!  Yeah.  Charles!  Yes!  Oh!  All right, well.  He's livid.  Back to desk scene.  Oh, Russell's turn to yell.  Calls Lily a cunt.  Yep.  Calls her a cunt.  Wow.  Cunt.  And if he would have said liquor after that, he would have been accurate.  She is.  What's the word there, Big A?  Cunt?  He has no problem saying that. 
[03:01:00]  Big, meaty hands around a throat.  All right, here we go.  How many girls, was that ring the last thing they ever saw?  Just glaring.  Look for that ring imprint around her neck.  Fuck you.  I'm just trying to fucking help you.  Do you understand me?  No, don't you?  I'm being a fucking collaborator.  I'm just trying to help you figure out the fucking picture.  Hey, bitch.  I'm not here to be fucking yelled at.  I worked on this fucking thing for three fucking years. 
[03:01:30]  I'm now some fucking cunt yell at me.  In front of the fucking crew.  Well, I'm trying to fucking help you, bitch.  Figure it out yourself.  Well, I have to do that.  Yeah, fuck yourself.  Good.  Why don't you fuck your whole movie?  Why don't you fuck your whole movie?  Because that's what you're doing.  We better get some insurance against the director.  You're a fucking one-night show at them.  You're a fucking grown-up. 
[03:02:00]  You're a fucking grown-up.  Act like a grown-up.  You're not a baby.  You're a fucking grown-up.  I'm here to fucking help you.  That's all I was doing was trying to help you figure out what you did.  Why don't you step out?  Talk to me.  Why don't you do it?  You don't do it.  You don't do it.  Do you want to yell it?  Do I not fucking yell at you before right now?  No.  I never fucking yelled at you.  You fucking stole it.  That's the yelling standard for the whole set.  Why do these clips always end?  You know there's more.  Oh, I know.  Where's the more? 
[03:02:30]  Do you know how great it would be if he was really yelling at Dakota Fanning like that?  Calling her a little cunt.  Yeah.  And a cock tease.  You fucking cunt.  I'm trying to help you, you little cunt, because she cried on the set because she was scared.  The set fucking dresses must have been just pleased as punch with him throwing everything  around.  He's throwing lamps and fucking shit on the desk.  The continuity guy has to make sure the stapler is just so. 
[03:03:00]  Yeah, exactly the way it was before he fucking had his tantrum and threw everything off of  there.  I think it was right here.  And toward the end of the argument, you just see one of the people with headsets come walking  in front of the camera and just ushering everybody off the set.  You just see a big line of people just leaving.  Sounds like he was close to hitting her.  Oh, he threw some shit like at her and she flinches at one point where she's convinced like he's throwing  something at her or going to hit her.  She doesn't seem to be a happy person in general.  No.  You hear things from time to time about her. 
[03:03:30]  She doesn't seem to be too happy.  Too happy.  So what ends up happening?  Did they end up...  Oh, the movie came out.  Yeah.  So they went back to working eventually?  Yeah.  At the end of that, she actually ended up apologizing to him.  He, uh...  Yeah?  Molded an opie.  Wow.  Nice.  Molded an opie on her.  Well, she probably had been yelling at him through the whole fucking movie and he just  snapped finally.  Finally had.  That doesn't sound like something that happens on the first, you know, occasion.  Like if somebody's being a little primadonna-ish or something on the set, that doesn't 
[03:04:00]  sound like a director that just snaps like that.  Because obviously she's yelling out in front of the whole crew.  Yeah.  Like you're going to yell at me in front of them.  When you say that in front of the whole crew.  Yeah.  Like you're embarrassing me in front of the whole crew.  It's like, you know...  Arr in front of the whole crew.  Arr.  You need discipline.  Yeah.  See, there's a way to do that stuff.  You don't have to take the direction.  There's a way to do it.  Yeah.  Like I would...  A lot of times when I wouldn't want to yell.  So if I'm going to do something different, I would just go, hmm, who's the actor here? 
[03:04:30]  Exactly.  You find that work, Jim?  Yep.  And I would put my hands in front of me and look up at this guy and just ask, who's the  actor here?  And I wouldn't work until someone said you are.  All right.  Let's go to Dave and Dallas.  Dave, what's up?  Dave, let's go.  Hey there, Dave.  Hey, uh...  Dave, welcome aboard.  Yeah, it sounds like it's staged to me.  No, stupid.  That's not staged.  Everything's fake.  What do you mean?  Or everything's real.  No, if you've ever seen...  Everything...  If you've ever seen the movie... 
[03:05:00]  Yeah.  That's what kind of movie it is.  Oh, yeah?  It's got that feel to it.  Oh, really?  The movie came out already?  Yeah.  I Heart Huckabees is a classic.  That's from I Heart Huckabees.  I Heart Huckabees.  I didn't know.  It's two years old, fellas.  Yeah, we know the movie's old.  We're joking.  Um, what about, uh...  Oh, my God, these people...  It's like that, though?  We gotta explain everything.  Like, there's arguments in it?  Yeah.  Well, it's got that tense kind of feeling.  My only weird...  Well, the reason is because they didn't get along when they were filming the damn thing. 
[03:05:30]  Yeah.  Why would she yell at Dustin Hoffman?  Unless they're friends, she's like, oh, fuck you two.  I can't picture anyone talking to Dustin Hoffman like that.  Well, no, wait, wait.  Yeah.  Dustin Hoffman and Lily Tomlin are competing psychiatrists.  Right, right.  So, so there is that...  Oh, shut up.  Yeah.  It's just because there was a wrestler in here earlier.  It doesn't mean everything's fake.  Right.  Nothing beats fucking YouTube or any of these other video sites when it comes to people  that see something that's real and insist it's fake, and then see something fake and 
[03:06:00]  insist it's real.  Our own Steve C.  You know what was a great fucking video that was fake, obviously?  It was, uh, did you see the UFO in front of the World Trade Center years ago where the  couple's in a helicopter?  Oh, yeah, yeah.  And then you see it, and the UFO comes up to the helicopter and goes, phew, up the side  of the Trade Center.  Yeah.  That was damn well done, man.  No.  I really thought it was a flying saucer.  It scared me.  I call people.  The fact that it was done in 2004 might have been a problem, though. 
[03:06:30]  It's the Trade Center.  Oh.  That was hurtful.  When things are hurtful, I can't help it.  I know.  Don't laugh at it, Jimmy.  Goodness comes in and pushes the hurt out.  Oh, no.  There it goes.  Oh, no.  That was goodness coming in and getting rid of the hurt.  Well, you must be completely devoid of hurt.  Nope.  That was goodness.  Comes in through my heart and pushes hurt out.  Oh, boy.  Why does hurt smell so bad?  Right.  Hey, we got Rosie versus Elizabeth still to go.  We got Heather Mills and Larry King. 
[03:07:00]  What's she doing there?  What do you want to do?  What do you want to do?  What do you want to do?  Talking about her stupid dancing.  Well, she was on...  With that leg that I'm not convinced she's got a fake leg now.  Oh, see?  I say Heather Mills.  Let's just ignore it.  You're eating healthy, too, man.  That's the problem.  The parts get worse when you eat healthy.  What did you eat, Jim?  Some of that fucking dog food that was killing people's pets?  Jesus Christ.  No, I didn't.  I'll take that.  Let's go to...  I say Heather Mills, man. 
[03:07:30]  Pass the shield spray around.  I need a shield.  Oh, there we go.  Motherfuck.  How bad is that, Otto?  It's so fucking goddamn bad.  Otto, here's some spray.  Pretty goddamn bad.  Just spray right on him.  It doesn't matter.  He's not human.  We don't care.  Anyone that thinks this is a pompous show is fucking two, four, six men in a room alone.  I'm farting.  We're spraying Febreze.  This is not a fucking rock star vibe at all.  No.  And we say Otto.  Otto. 
[03:08:00]  We should all be laughing.  Otto.  We should all be laughing at your fart.  Just giggling, not spraying stuff.  Putrid.  Only 007 could get out of this room without smelling that shit.  That's like a fucking...  It is the worst.  It really is bad, Jerry.  Well, then don't say hurtful things, and goodness won't have to push her down.  Oh, okay.  Heather Mills, I'm Larry King last night.  She did Dance with the Stars, and...  Heather Mills.  I saw a clip.  It almost looks like she has two legs.  It's a little creepy.  Her fake fucking leg has toes on it. 
[03:08:30]  Yeah.  She wears open-toed shoes.  What the fuck?  Really?  She goes to the best guy.  Paint little toenails on there with a roller.  She goes to the best guy.  The best guy.  Latex.  Yeah.  Yeah.  There's a place, actually, that opened up recently.  It was called Bill's Leg Shack, and it closed because they were all one length and none  of them bended.  Bended.  Bended.  And they would just kind of tie up.  They came with a rope on the end, and you'd just tie it to your stump.  Hey, they wouldn't fly off a lot.  Yeah, Bill's Leg Shack was a bust, and I invested everything in it. 
[03:09:00]  Leg Shack.  By the way, go to OttoandGeorge.com.  Yeah.  What gig are we promoting?  You're promoting Twitchell's gig, right?  Yeah, I'm doing the thing with Twitchell's.  Pitman.  Have you ever heard of Pitman?  No.  What is it?  In Jersey.  It's near Philly, so the Philly jerk-offs can come out and see it.  Philly jerk-offs.  All right.  You should be doing the TLA in Philly.  You should be doing the theater of the living arts.  Yeah, when are you going to start performing at comedy clubs?  What do you mean?  The theater of the living arts.  You should do it.  I just did Zaney's in Chicago.  All right.  There you go.  I sold out three shows there a night. 
[03:09:30]  It's great, right?  Fucking great.  Me and John Valby worked after me at midnight.  Oh, how cool is that?  Yeah, I'm glad I'm doing that Vegas thing.  The money is shit, but, you know, with you guys, but it's going to be good.  Why am I on the list after Ralphie May and who's the other one that's not as big as me?  Frank Caliendo.  Who the fuck is that guy?  Yeah, move on.  Is John Madden?  Move Otto up.  Well, it's not a list of prestige at all.  No.  It's actually a list.  Let's just move.  Put my name up further up. 
[03:10:00]  Put Otto first.  Been on this show forever.  Well, you're first, Jimmy.  But there's...  Oh, well, there is.  I don't care.  Put me in the middle.  Why do I care?  Uh, Ralphie May is below you.  Yeah.  Right above you is Rich Voss.  Uh-oh.  Okay.  Then Bob Kelly.  Then Frank Kelly, I know.  Then Louis C.K., Joe Rogan, and Jim Norton.  Okay.  No.  I say, why is Otto and George way down there?  Yeah, it makes me look like I'm going to mop up after this fucking show is over or something.  That suckers.  Why don't we do this? 
[03:10:30]  I have the order.  All right.  Why don't you do the order?  Okay.  This is for April 14th at the Joint.  That's right.  At the Hard Rock.  It should say like this.  Confirmed lineup.  Vegas.  Jim Norton and Friends TBA.  TBA.  Wow.  Otto.  Otto.  Otto.  All right.  Here's Heather Mills last night on Larry King.  Heather, does your leg ever come off?  It does normally if I go dancing, but I've put a great big strap on it, which doesn't look  so elegant and limits it in movement a little bit. 
[03:11:00]  But I just can't imagine if my leg comes off and I knock Len.  Goodman out, one of the judges.  I'll be in big trouble.  He took it off here once.  It comes off very easily.  That's funny.  Talking about a leg flying off.  How about this?  Why don't you pull it off and make Larry smell it?  Yeah.  Oh, smell it inside where the stump goes.  Yeah.  All those fucking dreams were shattered.  Silly motorcycle accident.  Yeah.  Goodman out, one of the judges.  I'll be in big trouble.  You took it off here once.  It comes off very easily.  It does.  It comes off very easily. 
[03:11:30]  And goes on very easily.  Yeah.  But I've put a strap on.  I'm doing a little trick with Jonathan that will surprise people next week when we do  the mumbo.  A trick?  Yeah.  Doing the mumbo.  Yeah.  And they could come off then.  There is a chance.  But it won't hurt me.  It'll just hurt Jonathan.  Oh, she's oxygenating.  She's going to take the leg off.  Oh, you were injured in a sidecar accident, were you?  That's what my understanding...  Guy doesn't understand anything that happened after 1940. 
[03:12:00]  Yeah.  Fucking out of touch.  Dope.  What's that?  They can make fake legs now?  I remember when they would just saw it off and then put leeches on the wound.  Tomorrow night, Danny Thomas.  Oh, wait.  He's dead?  When did that happen?  And I'll send a card.  And a touch cock.  It annoys you, too.  That's what I love about it.  Oh, he is just annoying.  It's like, how does he get this huge gig on CNN?  He doesn't know anything.  What was it?  The small back wheel or that large front wheel of the bicycle that your leg got caught in? 
[03:12:30]  Sort of an 1800s joke.  All right.  That's a good one.  Thanks, Than.  Oh, now you're playing.  I have to.  Wow.  Well, if it worked, you would have let it just sit there.  Than bats like 999.  That was one.  All right.  Here we go.  How do you react about Internet sites taking wagers on it coming off? 
[03:13:00]  I think it's funny.  How's your kickball?  Oh, you know how I've been about my leg.  I wouldn't pop it off like I did on here.  I hate this bitch.  To show you how great it looks.  It's about having a sense of humor.  Sure.  Did it ever fall off crossing the street?  Yes.  Abby Rhone.  And it was a really, really hot day and it started to slip and I took a step and it just kind of fell.  And this poor guy on his moped just saw this leg that looked really real lying in the front of the road and me hopping after it, trying to pick it up and hop out the way. 
[03:13:30]  And I went into this woman's boutique with my leg under my arm and I said, can I use your changing room to pop my leg back on?  Because I had trousers on, so I didn't want to flash my knickers in front of everybody.  You can play tricks on people with it.  Yeah.  Let them think they ran over you.  Oh, don't.  I could.  A guy dude had to park cars once in Miami.  One leg in me.  A guy would pull the car up, he'd throw the leg off.  Hey!  It was a Studebaker.  Why couldn't he come up with some funny tricks?  Like, did Paul ever fuck your doggy style and you fell off the bed because he didn't balance you outright? 
[03:14:00]  Did he have to chalk you up?  I think we know the website, by the way.  Luke in Texas.  Luke.  Hey, what's up, guys?  Hey.  Hey, wanted to let you know that your very own Bodog.net, your sponsors are taking bets on whether or not her leg is going to fly off during the competition.  Ah.  Get bet.  All right.  I knew there was a reason we love Bodog.net.  Bodog.  Nice, huh? 
[03:14:30]  That is very cool.  Thank you, sir.  Thanks for the info.  Ah.  All right.  So that's, uh, Heather Mills and Larry King.  Oh, I know.  Oh, I know.  The fucking leg of hers is the big story.  I'm going to suck.  I know.  Like, everywhere you go, they just ask you about that fucking leg.  She was married to the fucking, to a beetle.  Mm-hmm.  For God's sake.  Do you think he knew her leg was fucked up or do you think he just, like, was too polite to say anything once he took her pants off and was like, ugh?  Yeah, think about that.  You hook up, right?  You don't know.  I don't think it's the first thing you would say. 
[03:15:00]  It wouldn't be the first thing you'd say is, by the way, I got a fake leg or, hey, do you have a fake leg?  So they kind of go out, hit it off, have a good time.  Maybe they're not fucking the first night.  I don't know.  He's a beetle, so maybe they were, but.  Of course, they were.  He was fucking her mouth or fucking fingering her asshole.  Of course, he was doing whatever he wanted.  He probably shatting her mouth the first night.  And she swallowed it as per his instructions.  All right.  And then, you know, that leg, you know, they start taking the clothes off and then, oh, something I have to tell you. 
[03:15:30]  Oh, fuck.  Oh, well.  We're going to take a break.  Big A, you promoting anything?  You want to promote your appearance on the Ron and Fez show?  Shaving?  Anything?  Child.  I'm having an upcoming.  Child killing you'd like an audience for?  Nothing, huh?  No?  I don't like that.  No.  Hungry?  A little bit, yeah.  You've been eating healthier?  I'm trying.  What's a typical Big A breakfast? 
[03:16:00]  I usually have two muffin tops and.  What's a muffin top?  Two muffin tops?  The Seinfeld episode.  How old are you, one?  Oh, muffin tops.  Just muffin tops?  What do you do with the stumps?  They even at the homeless kitchen?  No, actually, they come as just muffin tops.  Oh, that's cool.  Oh, wow.  Top of the muffin?  Do you butter it?  Do you butter it?  Do you butter it?  Yeah.  Do you butter it?  That damn episode is hysterical.  What flavor?  Blueberry. 
[03:16:30]  Right?  Actually, chocolate chip and blueberry.  Blueberry.  Okay.  Why don't you stop?  So you have fucking cake for breakfast, is what you're saying.  You have fucking cake for breakfast.  Yeah.  It's not a muffin.  Have a corn muffin or a bran muffin, a little bit better.  Muffins that don't taste good are breakfast muffins.  Muffins that taste good are cake for breakfast.  Or cupcakes.  It's a cupcake.  It's a big fucking chocolate chip cupcake.  That's what you're having.  It is cake.  How do you try to eat healthy?  You reach for a fucking salad and then all of a sudden, ah, Intamin's donut. 
[03:17:00]  Yeah.  I tried.  I gave it a whirl, but my arm got sucked into the fucking donuts.  That's not all you eat, Big Daddy.  What else do you eat?  What's a big dinner for you?  No.  Well, what else for breakfast?  Not an Eggman.  Usually, sometimes I do have an egg sandwich.  Yeah.  From where?  Um, oh, dinner.  Yeah.  And that's all you eat? 
[03:17:30]  Um, yeah.  That's all you eat.  Just eggs and muffin tops?  That's it?  Yep.  You have a slow metabolism?  Like a fucking Brontosaurus?  How do you gain weight if you only eat muffin tops and a couple eggs?  What do you have for lunch?  Oh, wow.  It's the snacking that gets them.  Right.  That's that fucking rack of ribs that flipped Fred's car over.  No?  A lot of munchies?  Yeah, what do you eat?  A lot of snacks?  What is the snack? 
[03:18:00]  Sometimes.  What is Big A's favorite snack?  What's your guilty pleasure?  Yeah.  Wow.  Besides baby toes.  Yeah.  Though he's playing rats, but it's just him.  Right.  He breaks into homes and eats baby toes in a crib.  Oh, it just crunches him off.  Dips him in mustard.  It just helps.  Would you eat a baby toe?  Yeah.  What's your guilty pleasure?  What's your snack of choice?  Um, nothing too special.  I like pretzels and chips. 
[03:18:30]  We're not buying this.  Now he's eating pretzels.  There's got to be something that is 1,000 fucking calories per bite that you're eating.  He dips his pretzels in lard.  What do you eat that's fattening?  Yeah, what's the fattening stuff you eat?  And don't lie or I'll know.  You don't want to lie in front of a waddle.  Waddle.  Waddle is shy.  A waddle.  So what is it?  What's the fattening thing you eat?  Got to be something. 
[03:19:00]  We'll wait.  I guess cookies, you know, chocolate cookies.  What, do you want to get a box?  Get a whole box?  No, a whole conveyor belt.  A whole conveyor belt.  Just puts his head on the side of it and let it flow.  Wait, you actually, how many cookies were you eating in a sitting?  Um, two.  No, you won't.  Holy shit.  All right, we're in the middle of a bit now.  You should look like Travis. 
[03:19:30]  Travis eats more than that.  Get me the karaoke bit.  The whole audience is going to suffer unless you tell us what you eat that's fattening.  Hey, do we have any of those fucking Pugs and Kelly cookies?  Left?  Maybe Big A would enjoy a cookie.  Two cookies.  All right.  Muffin tops and a couple of eggs.  That's what you eat.  What do you have, a quarter slice of grapefruit?  And pretzels.  Give me, like, diet stuff.  Come on, Big A.  What's going on?  A peach and a grape.  Oh, my water.  And a stuffed derma. 
[03:20:00]  Come on, Big A.  What are you eating?  Come on.  What are you eating?  For dinner.  There's something got to keep that body the size it is.  I think you're supposed to eat about 2,500 calories a day.  Yours adds up to about 600.  Yeah, about 600.  You should be dropping, like, a lot of pounds.  Yeah.  Come on.  What are we missing?  Are you snacking in the cab?  The midnight snack?  All right.  What's the midnight snack?  Now we're on to some.  Hooker womb. 
[03:20:30]  Go ahead.  What's the midnight snack of choice?  I don't know.  Wherever I can find, you know, leftover food.  Leftover food.  What, in the back seat, you mean?  What?  No, in the refrigerator.  In your refrigerator.  But it's got to be leftover from what?  If it's leftover, it's just, you open your fridge, there's two eggs, there's a fucking muffin top,  and two cookies. 
[03:21:00]  What's the left?  What's left over?  All right.  Leftover food.  Like what?  I don't know.  Whatever's left over.  No, come on.  Give us an example.  Let's see.  Tell us everything you had to eat yesterday, starting with breakfast, ending when you fell asleep.  There you go.  Everything you ate.  I got five minutes of awful karaoke.  You don't want the audience suffering.  They'll blame you.  They will blame you. 
[03:21:30]  So what did you eat?  Let's go.  Breakfast.  Okay, I had two muffin tops.  All right.  I might not write this down.  Two muffin tops.  One chocolate chip and one blueberry?  No, he was humoring me.  It's chocolate chip.  I saw through that.  No, no, no.  I was going to have blueberries also.  Yeah.  And how much butter?  Actually, I don't have any, but I just take it in my cab, and I don't have any.  All right. 
[03:22:00]  Two muffin tops.  What else?  This is what you ate yesterday.  Okay.  And two eggs, bacon, and cheese on a roll.  Two eggs, bacon, cheese on a roll.  Okay, that's different than just two eggs.  Yeah, now the calories are moving.  That's the two eggs, bacon, and cheese on a roll.  Yeah, it's a little different than fucking egg whites.  Nice.  And any butter on that?  No.  Ketchup?  Okay.  Okay.  Just the nice runny yolk. 
[03:22:30]  All right.  We're getting somewhere.  What else?  Nice to have those.  Now, was that it for breakfast?  Yes, it is.  What kind of beverage?  It's water.  Whole drink of water.  Just water.  All right.  Cutting down.  All right.  All right.  Now, how about a snack?  What else did you eat yesterday?  Maybe a snack between breakfast and lunch?  No, I didn't have a chance.  Just had lunch.  Do you normally snack between breakfast and lunch? 
[03:23:00]  You might stop somewhere.  No, lunch is eight minutes after breakfast.  There's no time.  All right.  We're into lunch.  Lunch.  What do you have for lunch?  Grilled chicken with cheese and a little mayonnaise on a roll.  Grilled chicken, cheese, mayo.  That lunch got shitty fast.  Yeah.  I know.  Grilled chicken. 
[03:23:30]  It's like I had a grilled chicken salad with, you know.  No.  Grilled chicken.  With steamed broccoli.  Mayo on there.  Cheese, mayo.  What else?  You never.  Now, when you.  Where do you get this?  A deli?  Yeah.  Okay.  You never walk in, and I know this.  You don't walk into a deli and get a sandwich and fucking leave.  You get something to drink, and you get something else.  It's racks of fucking cookies and chips and shit all over the place.  Chips, maybe.  So what else did you get?  Yeah.  Um. 
[03:24:00]  I got those little donuts, the little chocolate donuts.  Yeah.  Oh, there's like 10 of them that come in that sleeve.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Those are good.  How many of those did you get?  Just one package?  Yeah.  How many of the pack did you eat?  Oh, you ate the whole package.  Yeah.  You ate the whole package.  Those are good.  One whole donut fits in your mouth.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, those are really good.  What else?  It has the miniature muffins. 
[03:24:30]  Mini muffins.  Where do you get the mini muffins from?  What are they?  Oh, I like muffins.  Like Hostess?  Yeah, Hostess makes them.  Yeah.  Hostess mini muffins.  Yes.  So Hostess mini muffins.  Now we're talking.  See?  Yummy.  This is what's going on now.  All right.  And what else?  Big sugar eating baby.  What'd you have to drink?  What'd you have to drink? 
[03:25:00]  Actually, I had my favorite Snapple white tea green apple.  Yeah.  I'll just write Snapple.  Okay.  So you had that grilled chicken with mayo and cheese on a roll.  Both sides of the bread which slopped over with mayo.  I don't know.  I didn't make it in an oven.  Oh, okay.  He just ate it.  And a little thing of the little teeny muffins we all love and a little thing of little donuts.  Yeah.  They're small. 
[03:25:30]  Yeah.  Small fun size.  They're little.  Is that it for lunch?  They come a hundred to a pack, but they're small.  That's it for lunch.  That was lunch.  Wow.  All right.  That's got to be a good lunch.  Yeah.  You up the calories there.  Yeah.  Any snacks between lunch and dinner?  Lunch and dinner.  No, no.  Come on.  Come on.  About three o'clock?  You're not getting a hankering for a candy bar or something?  Actually, I was totally full.  Totally full.  All right.  Then dinner rolls around.  All right.  As do you.  So, what did you have for dinner? 
[03:26:00]  Soup and sandwiches.  Soup and sandwiches.  Okay.  That was very telling.  What kind of soup?  Yeah.  What kind of soup?  Please take it.  Some kind of creamy.  Cheese on cheese.  Chocolate soup.  Creamy.  Chocolate soup.  With mayo and cheese.  Lentil soup. 
[03:26:30]  Lentil.  Lentil soup.  Oh, shit.  Lentil's good.  Lentil soup.  Wait, now, how big a helping?  Yeah.  How big a bowl?  Bowl or a cup?  A bowl.  Okay.  What'd you dip in it?  No bread to dip in a soup?  No.  Yeah.  Clear.  That's good shit.  Any cheese on top?  No.  You didn't dress up the soup with anything?  Not at all.  All right.  So, some lentil soup to start off with and then-  I still think I'm lying, but all right.  Lentil soup.  You said sandwiches.  Yeah.  What kind of sandwiches? 
[03:27:00]  This is cold cuts.  Ham and cheese.  What kind of?  What was it?  Ham and cheese?  Ham and a lot of cheese.  On what?  I'm noticing he loves his cheese.  Yeah.  On a whole wheat wrap.  Oh, nice.  A whole wheat wrap.  Well, he's eating healthy.  See, that's what's confusing.  I mean, like the grilled chicken sounds good.  The whole wheat wrap sounds good.  Whole wheat wrap.  But it's ham and cheese.  Lots of cheese.  Mayo probably.  Some mayo in there, too. 
[03:27:30]  Now, how many of those did you have?  Just one.  Oh, you said sandwiches.  You said sandwiches.  Yeah.  Did you have two?  Come on.  Okay, I had one potato salad.  That's good.  Yeah.  All right.  Potato salad, nice mixed with a lot of mayo.  Potatoes and mayo, so you can put them both in there.  Yeah.  Potato salad's not healthy, because I heard you say healthy.  It's really not.  Yeah, healthy.  So, potato salad.  There's a mayo and all that.  And then again.  And potatoes.  Again, potatoes healthy. 
[03:28:00]  But, I mean, they're kind of fattening, though.  Yeah, potato salad, very not healthy.  Oh, yeah.  A lot of mayo mixed in there.  Where'd you get that?  Yeah.  A deli, or?  Oh, yeah, A&P.  Okay, A&P.  Now, again, there are things, the impulse buy items, that are very tasty.  Right.  Tasty treat racks around.  What was your dessert for dinner?  You must have had some tasty treats.  Not even dessert.  We're not even getting into dessert.  Yeah, yeah.  Just the other thing that you had with your lentil soup.  The other thing that you bought when you got your wrapped lentil soup. 
[03:28:30]  Ham and cheese sandwich with mayo.  Lentil, a ham and cheese wrap with mayo.  Okay.  And what else?  Oh, potato salad with potato salad.  Potato salad with mayo.  And then the pickle.  A pickle.  Yeah.  And then what about the little racks of sugary treats?  Come on.  What did you get?  Come on, Big A.  What did you get?  Tea chips.  What?  You've got to get something to look forward to when you're eating that sandwich.  Actually, it was just cookies, I think.  Ah, just some cookies.  Just some cookies, all right. 
[03:29:00]  Just some cookies.  What kind?  Just moderate.  You've got a little sweet tooth.  Yeah, what kind of cookies?  Um, um, snack well, but not the chocolate ones.  The, uh, uh, uh, uh, the vanilla cream.  Oh, vanilla cream.  It's the cutiveness.  That's what's helping you.  Some vanilla cream cookies.  Yeah.  That's good stuff.  A whole package?  Only two of them.  Two packages? 
[03:29:30]  That's not bad.  What?  Now, after dinner, that was your little dinner dessert, was your snack well.  Are you sure, though?  Was that dinner?  Yeah, yeah.  Nothing else.  All right, what did you have to drink for dinner?  I have water.  All right, water.  Keep the calories down.  Where did you eat?  In my house.  Okay.  Where is your apartment?  Seriously, is it Manhattan or the Bronx?  I don't even know where you live.  Um, the Bronx.  Okay.  The Bronx, okay.  All right, now, uh.  Do you have bugs? 
[03:30:00]  Seriously, there's an apartment building and you can't help it sometimes.  I didn't even laugh.  Hope he has them sometimes.  He's mice.  You have roaches?  It's not too bad, no.  Sometimes?  Sometimes, that's too bad.  Where?  In the kitchen?  Yeah.  Got to compete with the roaches for the food.  Yeah.  All right, so.  Oh, they must tell their friends about his place.  It's all muffin tops.  You're going to love this, Kieran.  So, between dinner and Betty time, what did you have?  Actually, last night, right after, um, I ate, I was going up on, watched some DV, on my DVR, 
[03:30:30]  and then I just, just went to bed.  I didn't have nothing else to eat.  What does a big A watch?  Where do you get DVR in these days?  Um, I watch, um, 24.  Good show.  Sort of.  This year, they might have jumped the shark, they're saying.  Oh.  I never saw it.  And also, I can't get enough of ketchup predator. 
[03:31:00]  Oh.  Of course you can't.  You can't get enough of ketchup predator.  That's like me and him watching our friends on the evening at the improv.  I can't get enough.  Just wants to see what all the other boys are doing wrong.  Can't get enough.  Can't get enough.  Note to self, never leave through garage.  You have to change the screen name now.  It was big A muffin tops.  All right.  And the exercise thing.  See, the problem with big A is you have a job which is sitting. 
[03:31:30]  So you're in a car all day, right?  And we tried to get his colon cleaned out, and they were very disturbed.  They tried to call in minors.  Yeah.  Cement.  They said you were locked up pretty good.  So you're packed up pretty good, and the little nooks and crannies of your intestine,  they were all like, it was solidified in there.  So, you know, kind of hard to clear yourself out.  Why don't you take that one?  Who was that shit doctor that was in here at the time that had that weird concoction you drink, 
[03:32:00]  and it helps you start shitting better?  Cleaned you out.  Have you tried that?  Juice extractor, spinach and carrot, you'll shit like a motorboat going full throttle.  It'll really clean you out.  No, really, 60% spinach and 40% carrot.  Really.  He's not kidding.  You'll be spraying yoo-hoo all over the studio.  You know what else helps you shit, too, when you get wheatgrass?  You get a shot of wheatgrass.  It's actually sweeter than you think it's going to be, and I used to drink that vegetable 
[03:32:30]  juice every day, and it really does.  You almost shit liquid.  Yeah.  It's almost like there's no process it goes through.  Oh, God.  It was good.  It was apple juice for me.  Your IQ goes up when you take a good shit.  Your head clears up.  Yeah, true.  You think clearer.  Let's go to Rick.  Nothing worse than having to take a really bad one.  It becomes all-consuming.  You can't think of anything else.  Oh, yeah.  The toxins are building up.  Yeah.  You can't concentrate.  Let's go to Rick.  Rick, what's up?  Hey, I just, I'm trying to figure out where you're going with this, because I really don't  give a rat chance what this guy eats. 
[03:33:00]  Hmm.  But I think you do, because you called the show to talk about it.  That's fascinating.  Well, I call the show, like millions of other people call you guys and tell you, hey, you  know, where are you going with this?  We don't care.  Where's the one of you fucking stop listening, stupid?  Big A is our friend, and we're trying to figure out what he eats.  Jimmy, Jimmy, you little faggot.  I'm hanging on every word.  I think it's fascinating what he had for lunch.  I know.  Yeah.  Jimmy.  Go ahead.  Now what? 
[03:33:30]  You're a little guy, you know?  Yes.  You know, you should be careful what you eat.  I am, sir.  See, this is the kind of stuff we should be putting on the air.  Well, sir, are you fat?  No, sir.  Well, then why are you telling me I should be careful what I eat?  I am a little guy, so I kind of do watch what I eat.  Well, because you're awfully concerned about what crawls up your ass, so that's why I say  you got to be careful what you eat.  This is the kind of comedy and commentary we should be doing. 
[03:34:00]  I know.  You're a peon.  You're just a listener.  Rick on the phone every day.  You mean nothing.  Don't punish the listeners, Ope.  And then he laughs nervously.  Ope, don't punish the listeners.  Shut up.  Well, way to bring this song, everyone.  Yeah.  You're ruining everything.  Thank you, Rick.  We can't do that to the people. 
[03:34:30]  No, can't do that to us.  You know we're selfish.  We'd love to do that to the audience.  Unfortunately, we're stuck listening to it, too.  Oh, I know.  Yeah.  What's the gig again?  Twitchels, come in here and tell everyone about the gig.  Yeah.  And then we got to take a break.  You know something? 
[03:35:00]  That guy may have been right.  I don't know.  But I found myself fascinated with what he eats when he was trying to lie.  And then he just finally came out with it.  Andrew's a regular on the show.  He's not just some slob.  Right.  He's our friend, and he happens to you to be a slob, but to us, he's a person.  I think he was being a little dishonest at first, too.  Absolutely.  He didn't want to fess up.  We had to, like, drag it out of him.  At first, what do you eat? 
[03:35:30]  Two pretzels and a water?  Yeah.  And it turns out to be fucking some kind of ridiculous amounts of sweets.  Twitchels, what do you got?  Cheese and mayo.  The show tomorrow with Otto and George is going to be at the Broadway Theater in Pittman, New Jersey.  Why does this happen?  It's 8 o'clock tomorrow at the Broadway Theater.  You can get tickets at PittmanBroadwayTheater.com.  Who else is on the show?  It's Gino Biscani, Chris McDevitt, round boy Jimmy Graham. 
[03:36:00]  Okay.  Who you know.  Jimmy Graham?  Who is he, the fucking guy from the radio?  You know Jimmy Graham.  He used to tour with you when you drove Levy.  At least that's what he said.  I'm sure I know him.  I used to drive Levy, yes.  I used to drive Otto, too.  Absolutely.  Me and Otto did many gigs together.  I can't drive it.  I don't have a license.  Driving Miss Otto.  Hundreds.  Yeah.  You're the best friend I've ever had, Miss Otto. 
[03:36:30]  Hey, Twitchels, I hear your boyfriend did a karaoke entry.  What?  I don't have a boyfriend.  You do.  Oh, boy.  He won't commit to one cock.  That's the only reason he's yelling.  He wants to keep his possibilities open.  I have a fucking chick right in front of you guys.  Should you just stop hounding me about it?  I'm not gay.  All right.  Well, we don't think you're gay.  I'll do it.  I don't think you're gay.  Thank you.  Would you be able to get a ride in front of all these guys?  Huh?  Would you be able to get a hard ride in front of all these guys?  Jump.  I guarantee I wouldn't. 
[03:37:00]  Okay.  Guarantee it.  So how are you going to fuck the broad in front of us?  Just mush it in?  Get a broad in here.  No, no.  I said you can put me in front of a bunch of guys.  I won't get hard.  Not at all.  See, your own friend's saying that you're gay.  I'm what?  Your own friend just threw you under the...  Do you have Wizard of Oz posters in your room that you have downstairs in your parents' house?  Yeah, yeah.  I kind of do.  I love the movie.  It's my favorite movie.  Did you just make...  I think he was doing a cowardly line.  Wizard of Oz. 
[03:37:30]  You always pick it off me.  You're fastest.  I just want to go to Oz.  He's scaring me.  It's a great movie.  Perfect Peter Lorre.  Oh, it's my favorite character, too.  Yeah, do a little more.  But I'm straight.  Wait, everyone close their eyes.  I want to hear a little more of that.  You've got to hear that.  Wizard of Oz.  Oh, Dorothy.  I don't want you to leave.  You bastard, don't you leave, you little cunt.  I want to stay here.  I want you to stay with me. 
[03:38:00]  You do.  Wizard of Oz.  That's my employer speaking.  I like the Wizard of Oz.  It's a great movie.  It kind of makes me feel, you know...  Your friend, the son from the Great Santini.  He seems to think that you're a homosexual.  Hey, sports fans, is he gay?  Just because he is doesn't mean I am.  Is he gay?  I don't know, are you?  All right.  Well, that's Big Jim from Ron and Fez. 
[03:38:30]  He used to be the gay guy on the show.  Yeah.  Mm-hmm.  Is he gay?  Can you do the courage speech?  The courage.  I can do the song, I think.  I think I remember it.  I was Caroline in my senior year in high school.  All right, why don't we hear the song?  Go ahead.  A little bit.  If I am a king of a forest,  I'm not duke, I'm not queen,  I'm a king.  I command each thing, 
[03:39:00]  the fish of fowl,  and I'll glow.  He does these impersonations.  I swear, you would think it was the real people.  Hey, all right, man.  I'll go home and get you a fucking shine box.  I know Anthony, but that's the only one I can really do.  There's another one you can do.  Huh?  What's the other one you can do? 
[03:39:30]  I don't want to start getting into my impressions.  No.  No, no, no, no.  Come on, you're the Cowellee Lions.  What's the matter with you?  Of course you're doing impressions.  I'm getting...  Let me think.  How are you getting...  I'm breaking your balls,  and no matter what,  you're getting fucking fresh.  Nervous now?  How are you getting fucking fresh?  Getting fucking fresh.  Yeah.  I get doing...  His stupid party.  What?  Greatest observation about the party  made by fucking Otto Peterson. 
[03:40:00]  Otto.  And Goodfellas,  you're breaking up my fucking party.  Party.  So what do you think?  I'm trying to think of who else.  I used to do...  I could do Paul Lynn doing a rooster.  Paul Lynn impersonating a rooster.  I heard someone do it once.  Cock a little boo and all that jazz.  See?  I knew it was going to go nowhere. 
[03:40:30]  Yeah, it was horrible.  He does these impersonations.  I swear, you would think it was the real people.  I got to think of it.  I got to think of...  Oh, come on.  You know your act.  You know who you do?  No, I never did impressions, though.  I just do.  I just watch movies and...  What else do you do?  Just do it, man.  Just use your mind.  Jump.  Just fucking...  I'm trying to think here.  I know what your worst impression is.  What?  A straight guy with Tourette's.  Do an impression of a guy who doesn't jump.  I used... 
[03:41:00]  I mean, I do a horrible Jack Nicholson.  Do it.  It's great to be here.  Actually...  George Bush or Paul Lynn?  That was more Paul Lynn.  That's actually not bad.  I didn't do it.  That's actually not bad.  You're busting my chops.  See, I think it's horrible.  It's horrible.  This is why I don't do it.  The lion's all I got.  That was actually a go-in.  That was Steve Nicholson.  That was Jack Pudden.  You better go back to the lion. 
[03:41:30]  Go back to the lion.  Bring him back on your side.  I dare you to do him.  Get out of there, you tin cans.  What's you hit me for?  I didn't buy him, but you tried to.  I was just killing.  Dude, you are so fucking gay. 
[03:42:00]  You are so gay.  Oh, God.  You gotta face it.  There's nobody that recites The Wizard of Oz.  No.  But you think he did a pretty good Cowardly Lion.  Well, you're gonna think that he's even more gay.  I know two of the munchkins.  Okay, go ahead.  That are still...  No, I know them.  Oh, you know them?  They're still alive.  Sometimes when they would do appearances, they...  Do you blow them?  Yeah, I thought so.  That's correct for I don't know. 
[03:42:30]  Yeah, Big A, you do impressions?  That's coincidence, because Big A ate a box of Duncan Munchkins before he came here.  You do impressions?  Big A does some impressions, too.  Do one of your impressions.  Thank you, baby.  Porky Pig.  And speaking of lion, that's what you were doing about your lunch.  We know you had more.  See, speaking of.  Anytime you say speaking of in a comic, dog shit lion on a place.  Speaking of.  Funny, you should say.  No, it isn't.  It was funny right up until the talkies came out. 
[03:43:00]  So, they're asking for dice.  You do dice?  Hickory dickory deck.  Oh, wow.  Your girlfriend was sucking my cack.  Believe it or not, I didn't even know.  I didn't even know who dice was, believe it or not, before I started listening to you guys.  So, I don't know a lot of his stuff to really like.  I never watched or heard of a lot of his stuff to try.  Yeah, do the cowardly dice.  I think you're onto something with that.  Cowardly dice.  Yeah.  Yeah.  A hickory dickory dog.  Opie and Anthony were sucking like hot. 
[03:43:30]  Oh, now it turns around on us.  I don't like.  I don't even know.  You're breaking your balls and you're getting ready when you're getting fucking fat.  I don't even know.  Look.  Cowardly lion was really the only one.  Oh, oh, oh.  Oh, oh.  I do a little bit of Jimmy Stewart.  Yeah, a little bit.  All right.  All right.  Jimmy Stewart.  You want the moon, Mary?  I'll throw a lot of show around now.  I'll give it a moon.  How would you like that?  Give it a moon, Mary.  All right.  That's all I got for you.  Anthony is leaning on the table, putting his forehead in his hand.  Because it's uncanny. 
[03:44:00]  It's amazing.  It really is.  Not bad.  I was going to say it was like looking into just a can where talent was supposed to be  and finding it just empty.  But sometimes when I try to do the impressions, I try to hold the tics back so I can do it.  But sometimes I get it just pops up.  So it's all these people with Tourette.  So it's Jimmy Stewart with Tourette.  I was thinking of doing that part of my act like, well, what if our favorite celebrities have?  Oh, okay.  All right.  Give us a few more.  Can you start with Bud Dwyer? 
[03:44:30]  I don't know.  I mean, I really can't think right now.  So if you want to just shoot a bunch of names, I can try.  If you turn around, well, I don't want to rip off Gorilla Boy, but Archie Bunker.  Archie Bunker.  I love all the family, too.  Do you turn around and then put a hat on and a cigar and turn back around?  Yeah.  Hey, just give me a bit.  Oh, Archie.  Oh, why are you always so mean to me, Archie? 
[03:45:00]  Give me a bit, you cunt.  I don't know.  I guess that's all right.  I really never, haven't watched it that much.  All the family in a few years.  Did any girls hear him do that noise?  Hey, Meatball.  Or Meathead.  Whatever you call him.  Hey, Meatball.  We're getting a request for Richard Jenny coming in.  We'll need a couple of shovels and flashlights.  All right.  I thought it was a good lawnmower. 
[03:45:30]  That was a jalopy.  I thought it was a sprinkler myself.  That's a good sprinkler.  One of them sounded like the baby alien after it ripped out a giant, what's his name, chest,  right before it scurries off the table.  Right.  Love me.  What are we going to get off this island?  Oh, get me some coconuts.  I'll give you millions of dollars.  Is that all right?  Mr. Howell.  I know.  There you go.  Love it.  That's what we should do. 
[03:46:00]  Have him do the impression.  We try to guess who he's doing.  Shut up.  All right.  Let's go to Dennis in Edison.  Dennis, what's up?  What's up, guys?  Hey.  I wonder if you could open the window and he could do a Superman impression.  Very good, Dennis.  Doc Twitchell.  All right.  Thank you.  My friend Dean used to look like George Reeves, so all the bigger kids would call him Clark  Cunt.  Just to make him feel bad about himself. 
[03:46:30]  I love Jimmy's little tidbits about his friends growing up.  Clark Cunt.  I guess that's about it for Twitchell.  Harvey Feist, Dean.  I could do a little bit of Harvey Feist, Dean.  I bet you could.  Just a little bit, sweetheart.  You want to do all of Harvey Feist.  I knew you'd like that.  Go ahead.  I interrupted.  Oh, it's okay, Opie.  It's not a problem.  Do you ever want me to make you into a woman?  I'll make you into a woman. 
[03:47:00]  What's that, Mrs. Doubtfire?  Don't ask me to help.  Boy, he leaned over to Jimmy for a helping hand.  I mean, that's an idea.  I'll work on a bunch of impressions.  It's a good idea.  Yeah, sure.  Celebrities with Tourette's.  I like to see if we can guess the impression.  The concept is very good.  Yep.  It's like, yeah, I have to watch him a bunch of times.  And The Wizard of Oz, I've seen that a couple times.  How many times have you seen The Wizard of Oz?  But you can't do Coward of the Lion.  But do a scene you haven't done yet.  I'm trying to, I don't know if I remember much. 
[03:47:30]  Yes, you do.  Is it over 100?  Is it over, no, I would say, I would say like 30, 40 times maybe.  You know, I look, whenever it comes on, I just, I guess got to keep watching it.  Good point, though, he hasn't seen it, he's only seen it 40 times.  How many times have you heard it while your nose was buried in a man's pews when he was watching it?  They don't watch that stuff.  All right, let's go.  More cowardly, Lion.  And strong for us before we move on here.  Oh, Pete Anthony, thank you so much for having me on this show. 
[03:48:00]  I appreciate it.  I've been a little depressed these days.  Just feeling all lonely.  Fucking Dorothy left me.  It's not him anymore.  Cunt.  Wah!  Broom!  Get the dance.

Bottom line.  All right.  Bring in Travis.  Line of the day brought to you by Bodogfight.com.  Is Steve getting a bald spot?  For the last two years, yes.  Jesus.  I just noticed him.  Well, look at him.  Might just be the way it's combed today.  It's got a lot of product in it.  What do you mean?  It'll kill him.  No, I'm not going to say anything.  It'll kill him.  What happened? 
[04:06:30]  Nothing.  Good one.  What?  Jimmy, this mirror's on the ceiling.  You know, it's very easy.  There you go.  This is fine.  What's wrong with the outfit?  What did I do?  Nothing.  Steve, I had nothing to do with this one.  What got said when I was outside?  Nothing.  I honestly don't know.  Listen to the replay.

Why would you say that, Twitchell?  I didn't say anything.  No, I didn't. 
[04:07:30]  Why did you say that?  I did not say a thing.  And first of all, I'm not a homo, and I didn't say a thing.  You sure?  You don't look very honest.  See, I had nothing to do with that one.  I did not say anything about your bald spot.  It's fine.  Actually, it is there.  It is there.  How did you know when he just whispered, stupid?  Because I heard him.  I heard him.  I heard him.  I heard you whisper.  You're standing four feet from me.  I didn't say it was not me, but I'm not going to say who it was. 
[04:08:00]  I don't want to be like a gay rat, you know?  You're queer.  You're queer.  No.  Wow.  It's me ticking and twitching.  Why are you so nervous yet?  No, nothing.  Nothing.  I know he's a big boy.  He works out like 12 hours a day, but that's nothing to be nervous about.  I'm not nervous.  Yeah, I immediately find the most intimidating person in the room and start fucking with him.  Really?  Well, don't do that to Jimmy. 
[04:08:30]  It's not nice.  It's not nice.  Why Jimmy?  He said it.  It was not me.  I didn't say anything about your bald spot.  I don't know exactly what happened.  You rat.  No, I don't care.  Not even a...  Steve walked out, Pustos looks up, and points at his head.  And that's why...  No, I didn't.  No, I didn't.  You bastard.  And I'm like, why is he pointing at Steve's head?  I was not.  I was trying to figure out how you were going to get it out of that one. 
[04:09:00]  And I didn't know what he was talking about.  I'm like, does Steve have a bald spot?  Because he's fucking...  I'm like, why would he point like that?  It's probably the hair product you have in today.  Well, it's probably making it more obvious.  Yeah, sometimes if your hair's more wet...  Are you kidding?  Let me see.  Honestly.  It's right there.  It's more wet.  No, that's not that noticeable.  Oh, it's completely noticeable.  Oh, I know.  Are you kidding?  Look, Steve.  I have nothing to do with this one.  Nothing.  Nothing.  I swear to God.  I was just wrapping up...  I swear on the Wizard of Oz that it was not me. 
[04:09:30]  ...and my small penis and bald spot by working out excessively.  Oh, my God.  Call the girls back in.  Oh, my God.  Girls, come on in for a sec.  Don't say anything.  All right, we won't.  Because I want to see what they're doing.  Can you come in for a sec?  I want someone to hear line of the day.  Oh, all right.  We'll do line of the day for the girls.  Go to bowdogfight.com.  Jimmy wanted you back in here because he thinks one of you are cute.  Yeah.  That's very nice.  He actually said both.  Oh, God. 
[04:10:00]  All right.  Here's the runner-up line of the day.  Soup and sandwiches.  Okay.  That was very telling.  What kind of soup?  Yeah, what kind of soup?  Please take it.  Some kind of creamy soup.  Cheese on cheese.  Chocolate soup.  Creamy.  Chocolate soup.  That was very funny. 
[04:10:30]  Good runner-up line.  Do you wear thong underpants or bikini bottoms?  It depends on what I'm wearing.  Hey, one of you girls farted.  No, that was in here before we even walked in.  What was in here?  Oh, God.  Oh, but she walked in.  I heard a lady.  One of you girls farted.  No, don't blame us for your sins.  You walked in and smelled it?  Oh, yes.  Oh, yes.  It was like a forest. 
[04:11:00]  That's disgusting.  She did a bewitched nose switch when she walked in.  Why would you guys notice?  You almost took two steps back.  Why would you say anything if you walked into a cloud of fart?  Oh, my God.  You guys are just going crazy in here.  It's awful.  Why would you notice it?  Now or the first time?  No, when we first walked in.  Before, right?  Yeah.  Fuck off.  Did any guys ever give you a Dutch oven in bed?  You ever hear of that?  No.  Where they shove your head under the covers and fart and then leave you under there fighting  your way out?  No.  No.  Never got that. 
[04:11:30]  Thank you.  Good.  All right.  Do you ever eat pork and beans out of a flashlight?  No.  Oh, my God.  Really?  Just curious.  No.  It's the only way to eat them.  What's that bar that does that?  I forgot.  Tiki Bar.  Yeah.  Is it?  Mm-hmm.  After a night of drinking, that's how they serve the food.  It's something different.  That's all.  Yeah.  All right.  Thanks, ladies.  Oh, God.  It stinks.  Oh, that was bad.  What kind today?  I'm just curious.  What? 
[04:12:00]  What kind?  Bikini bottoms?  Yeah.  Are they?  Yeah.  Just show Jimmy the...  That's fine.  I like bikini bottoms better, actually.  Oh, okay.  All right.  And boy shorts.  You like Jimmy?  By the way, you girls are not honest.  You should have commented on the farts as soon as you came in here.  Yeah.  You didn't ask us.  It was very odd.  You should have just went, holy shit, something stinks in here.  I mean, if you guys go out there and walk back in, you'll notice the difference.  Yeah, I know.  Do you shave a little or a lot?  No.  How much do you shave?  Really?  Mm-hmm.  Sexy.  Jimmy likes that.  I do.  I like to see the...  Jimmy's killing me today. 
[04:12:30]  You have big lips?  Big lips?  You're so in detail.  No, we're not going to...  We're just talking...  Gave you a lot of detail there.  No, I know.  That's what I'm saying.  As soon as you left, Jimmy said big, by the way.  Well, he did.  If we're going to call each other out, yeah, Jimmy was talking about your lips.  Wow.  Not to be insulting at all.  He likes the big ones.  He does.  Yeah.  Jimmy, explain the type of lips you like, just so she understands.  It should look like a retard's mouth.  Nah.  Sorry to just call you.  True it all. 
[04:13:00]  Picture a Down syndrome boy killing a dog and then crying over it, like the way his mouth  would look.  That's going to be the name of your book, too.  All right.  Thanks, ladies.  Bye.  Wano.  Wano.  All right.  Wait, wait, wait, wait.  They just heard about their nose.  They're like, oh, my nose.  Bodogsmite.com.  They're going to hold their breath. 
[04:13:30]  Line of the day.  Yeah, line of the day.  Yeah.  Here comes the line of the day.  Line of the day.  Line of the day.  Line of the day.  Line of the day.  Line of the day.  Line of the day.  Oh, shit.  It proves your sacred scrolls are wrong.  If you'd read them instead of using them on each other, try unrolling one one time and  read it. 
[04:14:00]  All right.  Enough.  Oh, God.  All right.  Enough.  It keeps going.  Wait.  One more time.  Get them back in here.  Oh, no.  Girls.  We got something for you.  No, I swear to God.  We give all our listeners a little gift for coming in and watching the O.P. and Anthony  show.  What?  And smelling this.  No.  Sorry, I'm smelling this, I said.  What?  Okay.  Sorry about that. 
[04:14:30]  What is that?  Smelling it.  I thought he just wanted me closer.  That's all.  Is it still, uh...  Does it still reek in here?  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Really bad?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah, that was Big A. He's backed up a little bit.  Too much cheese in his diet.  You can admit it, Big A.  You can admit it.  Who was it then, Big A?  I don't know, but it wasn't me.  He's a good boy.  Big A's a good boy.  He's no rekt.  How are you standing there? 
[04:15:00]  The whole room is like...  Are you breathing at all?  No.  Yeah.  Is it...  Oh!  Oh, Jimmy!  That was worth it the whole time.  You have no...  You have no class.  Try to.  That's the type of squeak.  That's gonna sound...  That's gonna smell horrific.  Oh, is it awful?  Breathe through the mouth.  Breathe through the mouth.  Isn't it bad?  No, but then you're just eating his shit molecules.  Oh, God.  What?  I can't talk to my friend?  Come on. 
[04:15:30]  All right.  We should get the pleasure.  Hey, uh...  It was fun today.  Yeah.  What a fish.  You know what the best part of this is?  After all the fun and excitement we had here,  we now get to have twice as much  meeting with Bob.  Eat.  I didn't say it.  I'm being good today.  I'm the good one today.  He's trashing you.  I'm not trashing him.  I'm just saying we're gonna have twice  the fun and excitement  meeting with Bob.  Why is Bob sitting next to Dustin Hoffman 
[04:16:00]  in a Phil Spector wig?  That's his brother.  They both look like Peter Cushing.  That's creepy English grave robbers.  That's Super Agent Bob Eatman  and his brother.  His brother usually has the facial hair  so it looks like evil Bob,  but not today.  Jew and his stand-in.  He doesn't have his evil Bob goatee today.  By the way, 
[04:16:30]  don't kill the messenger.  Dogshit sniffer from Woodside.  Steve C. wins  receding hairline of the day.  Oh, my God.  It's not receding hairline at all.  It's not receding hairline.  Absolutely not at all.  It's not accurate.  officials, what do you think?  I think his hair looks fine.  All right.  Very good.  Looks good.  Big A, you promoting anything?  Your appearance on the Ron and Fez show,  probably?  Yeah.  Yeah.  In 45 minutes?  Exactly.  All right.  Oh, oh.  He's trying to get a belt sponsor  for the next strangulation. 
[04:17:00]  True Life's on again tomorrow night,  8 o'clock on MTV.  He's shown it 100 times.  Everyone's seen it by now.  Well, you can see his basement  with the fucking Judy Garland posters.  And I'll be in Rhode Island tonight  at the Comedy Connections  to August tomorrow  and Boston Friday and Saturday.  Just follow the smell.  You'll get there.  The last one was me.  I apologize.  But the first one was...  Yeah, I feel like you.  I don't mean to throw him under the bus, but...  Too much cheese on his diet.  Come out and see the big show  at Pittman, right?  Yeah, at the Broadway Theater. 
[04:17:30]  Go to PittmanBroadwayTheater.com  for tips to board,  Otto and George.  Yeah, tomorrow night  at the Broadway Theater  there's Pittman, New Jersey,  PittmanBroadwayTheater.com.  It's going to be a great show.  You're doing a full set.  It's a 40-minute set or whatever.  Not like you see my traveling virus.  I'm going to do an hour.  I want to say hi to my friend  Big Dan in Long Island.  He just text-messaged me.  Another fat pot-smoking zero  from Long Island.  And OttoAndGeorge.com.  Yes, Otto,  one of the greats  tonight doing an hour,  so go see the show.  And girls,  do you want to plug anything?  No. 
[04:18:00]  Say hi to anybody?  No?  No?  Hi, Mom.  Who do you want to say hi to?  It's very telling.  What do you want to say hi to?  Nobody.  One of your brothers.  Say hi to any brothers.  I don't have a brother.  Sister?  What are your sister's names?  I will say hi to Riley.  Who's Riley?  My niece.  Oh.  Do you have a niece?  Wait, so you have a niece  and two brothers?  Two sisters.  Two sisters.  Why do I keep getting that wrong?  Do you have a nephew  named Oliver?  No,  a nephew named James.  James.  Something just familiar.  Say hi to your maid, 
[04:18:30]  then, Elise.  Hi to your maid.  You have a maid?  Are you rich?  I don't know.  You have a maid?  Have a maid?  Maybe before the divorce.  No, poor.  Really?  No.  I bet I know  what your father does  for a living.  Would you like some muffins?  Hey, Nicholas.  I don't.  Oh, you don't know?  No.  I'll tell you.  What?  I bet he's an architect.  No?  No, he wasn't.  No?  No.  Fuck.  He wasn't.  Wait, did he pass away?  No, he moved away.  Oh.  Where did he move to?  Heaven.  I think California.  You don't know him?  San Francisco? 
[04:19:00]  He was a bad dad, huh?  Yeah.  Yeah, what did he do to you?  He left.  No, he did something to you,  didn't he?  Oh.  Yeah.  I don't know.  I probably repressed those memories.  You what?  I probably repressed those memories.  What does the best word mean?  Where do that?  Where I don't want to remember.  Oh.  And it's, yeah.  And the, wait, the word is?  Repressed.  Oh, I'm going to look that up  when I get home.  When did he leave?  How old were you?  I like learning a word a day, big A.  Thirteen?  Thirteen?  Yeah, that's much later.  And who's Nicholas?  Thirteen.  Nicholas.  I thought you said Nicholas. 
[04:19:30]  No.  James was the only name she said.  I swear to God,  someone said Nicholas then.  No.  All right, I apologize then.  All right, ladies.  Unless you want to fart in their faces again.  No, I had a thing with,  I like Carly.  I had a little bit of a thing  crushing her.  Yeah, you think there's something  going on between you two?  No.  I like her.  No.  I think there's something going on.  I think she likes me.  Why are you staring at her?  It's a real turn now  until it farts.  You're farting at her  and you're also staring at her vag.  Jeez.  I saw you. 
[04:20:00]  I saw you.  You keep looking down  because you really want to know  what those lips look like.  I like them to look.  I don't mean this to be disrespectful.  All right, there we go.  But did you ever see  like during a high stress situation  what a primate's asshole looks like?  Like a chimp  or an orangutan  that's angry  how the asshole will bulge out  and hang out.  Can't.  Can't at all?  Oh, God.  No, I can't say I've seen that. 
[04:20:30]  Sorry.  And that's what you like.  All right, ladies.  You got to go.  Yeah.  Stick around for Ron and Fez.  I've been locked in a jail cell  by an old prospector.  All right.  We're just curious.  At this point, we get it.  Just curious.  This is the background  and this keeps going and going.  We're a bunch of douches.  Yeah.  All right.  Everyone got their plugs in? 
[04:21:00]  Yeah.  All right.  I need help with my book title.  So that whack bag thread,  I would appreciate it.  What about FBA?  Because now they're going to get mad.  I love FBA.  I only saw the one on whack bag.  FBA hates me.  They do?  No.  Oh.  I just wanted some love.  Money shot.  The Jimmy love thread.  You know,  turn into disaster after five posts.  Of course it will.  Yeah, I love him,  but, you know,  sometimes he,  and then by the 10th thread down,  the 10th post down,  fucking guy's a douchebag. 
[04:21:30]  Got an observation, by the way.  We went really long today  because Super Agent Bob Eatman  is sitting out there.  Yeah.  Yeah.  It seems like we're working real hard.  No, it's not that.  We're stalling because we,  you know.  Yeah, we gotta.  We gotta hang on him now.  Yeah, we gotta go get some breakfast.  I'm gonna go get some muffin top  with Bob.  All right, Danny.  Are ya?  Danny should just,  are ya?  End it with something, Danny.  I don't know.  Yeah, go ahead, Danny.  Just get us out of here, please.  We're just dying now.  Just going with the kidney failure

Tell Big A to say hi to Jay Moore  when he calls Rotten Fez.  Oh, yeah.  Could you tell Jay we said hi?  Fuck.  All right. 
[04:22:30]  Yeah.  All right.  Bye.  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  I was walking down the street, and some construction guy was shouting at me,  Hey, show me your cans.  So I did.  And he plummeted 17 floors and was impaled on a forklift.  But my tits looked great.  Please, wow responsibly.  A public service announcement of the Opie and Anthony Show.
