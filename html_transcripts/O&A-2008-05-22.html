<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony show opened with self-deprecating and offensive jokes directed at the hosts and their listeners, leading into a discussion of Opie's upcoming 30th birthday, which unexpectedly became the subject of an in-studio celebration despite his attempts to avoid it.  A significant portion of the show was dedicated to promoting a gas giveaway at two locations,  which generated significant media attention, including a news crew and a helicopter covering the ensuing traffic chaos.  Updates on this gas promotion, provided by Keith via phone calls, continued throughout the broadcast.

Anthony recounted his 35-hour date with Jill Nicolini, a local news traffic reporter.  This detailed account included a late-night trip to a Long Island animal hospital for cat neutering, a visit to Nicolini's family home, and a stop at a car dealership.  Anthony’s wearing of Nicolini’s hat became a recurring comedic element, fueling speculation about the nature of their relationship.  Callers contributed to the humorous and often satirical discussion of the date, further elaborating on the bizarre events.

The show also highlighted Jimmy's successful HBO taping the previous night, with the air date announced.  A discussion of the documentary "Bigger, Stronger, Faster" ensued, featuring an in-studio interview with the filmmaker, Chris Bell.  Bell discussed the documentary's focus on bodybuilding, steroids, and the supplement industry, recounting his unsuccessful attempt to interview Arnold Schwarzenegger, which resulted in him ending up on the *LA Times* cover with Schwarzenegger instead.  He highlighted the ethical dilemmas surrounding muscle-enhancing technologies and the unregulated nature of the supplement industry, sharing anecdotes about a friend fired for honestly discussing steroid use while working for a company sponsoring a steroid-filled bodybuilding competition. The segment also included discussion of supplement effectiveness and potential negative effects, concluding with promotional information for the film.

Following the interview with Chris Bell, comedian Gallagher joined the show.  His in-studio appearance featured discussions about his inventions (including a new toilet design and ideas for modernizing slot machines), anecdotes from his stand-up career, opinions on other comedians (Jim Carrey, Robin Williams, Jerry Seinfeld), and provocative commentary on current events and politics.  He shared his views on the supplement industry, interspersed with references to his watermelon-smashing act and upcoming performances at the Stress Factory.  The segment culminated in a messy birthday cake-smashing celebration (for both Opie and Dan), involving the throwing of cake at the hosts and a fan, followed by the smashing of ketchup and other substances, leaving the studio in significant disarray.  Gallagher also discussed his age, a lawsuit from a mouthwash incident, his family relationships, and plans for new websites ("Smash My Face" and "Dance Pyramid").  The hosts jokingly blamed "Stunt Brain" for the resulting mess.

Throughout the broadcast, several other segments were interspersed.  These included a running joke about Tim Russert's on-air misspeaking, a humorous clip of a news anchor's interview abruptly cut short due to a dog attacking a man in a padded suit, and a brief discussion of the new Indiana Jones movie.

[00:11:30]  constantly and so then you're like trying to plug in your your uh charger and get your iphone all  charged up and i'm like okay that's something's going on and then uh i noticed a uh hat on your head  that isn't the regular 511 or 511 hat don't start making faces jimmy thank you don't start making  faces thank you and that stands for jimmy listen hold on hold on it was let me set this up for the

[00:12:30]  this was yesterday's um get up all the way out there on on uh exit 68 and he goes and then this  is what he killed himself because i i wouldn't have noticed i'm telling you right now and i know you  wouldn't have noticed jimmy he goes and i had to borrow a hat this morning and i quickly looked at  his hat and anthony is wearing a hat with the letter j on it okay now jimmy is disgusted i don't want to  jump to conclusions um are you wearing that hat um he's saying did you take a trip to israel 
[00:13:00]  no no there wasn't a trip to israel  okay here here's the deal here's the deal yes you're wearing i you're wearing jill nicolini's  hat the j stands for jill they can't it can't stand for anything else look i don't know what it stands  for all i know is as you know i i got here a little late this morning so i i woke up a little 
[00:13:30]  late i didn't have my iphone like i had said it wasn't charged and i couldn't set the alarm on it  and uh the other alarm wasn't really loud enough so um i uh i woke up late i wasn't able to jump in  the shower real quick and i had medusa head like snakes coming off my head just a a wreck so yeah  but what what what did she she left her jill hat at your house i'm a little confused i'm a little uh 
[00:14:00]  look i'm i'm just i'm just i'm leaving everything open here to speculation i'm a little confused like  so all i had you woke up late so i woke up late and she just happened to have one of our hats that  she left behind at your fine no it was a mansion it was a choice between the j hat or a pink mets hat  or a visor uh believe me i went through a lot of hats and this was the i figured this was the safest 
[00:14:30]  one i hope you i hope you were ted kennedy's yeah with a big p on the front for pudding  wow you know jimmy don't even shake your head anthony embrace this what this is your last chance  at survival survival yes yes there's something going on here just embrace it start showing some  real emotion for once in your in your lousy life and embrace this this is a gift this is a gift

[00:27:30]  thank the fine listeners of this radio station here in new york city because uh the new ratings  came out yesterday the new rating uh the old ratings going away good they're they're not using  the new ratings officially yet unfortunately but they are uh taking a peek anyway actually the  advertising uh community is really paying attention to the new ratings because it's going to be the  thing in another two or three months the thing of the future and uh we were number one across the  board with men in morning drive radio here in new york city yeah except for one demo men 25 to 54 we 
[00:28:00]  were number two behind a dumb uh all news station 10 10 wins 10 10 wins news that's why we do traffic  and weather together on the 8th because now we're going to take that you know we're going to take down  the news station next but thank you to all the uh the men listening to this fine radio show  hey we're trying to soften a little bit so some women are listening to this damn thing we're doing  better in men we were number one and in women we crept up to number 375 
[00:28:30]  that's the line  yeah so and it's weird because the old rating and not so good but new ratings were like uh we're  superstars so you figure it out there ones are more accurate yeah let's yeah that's what i would  like to think uh keith the cop what's going on hey good morning i'm over here at the uh luke oil  and wanto avenue and sunrise highway and uh wanto for the gas giveaway okay and uh 
[00:29:00]  either it's a really slow news day or this is like a big deal because news 12 is here  oh god news 12 oh my god wow  joan parkin from news 12 is running up and down the line interviewing people and he's interviewing  our fans right now which i guess they'll probably maybe just go with an audio and cut the video  because you know our fans yeah uh the helicopter up above us and they're like taking aerial shots  too really really and we got uh probably about 50 to 60 cars lined up right now okay so uh so 
[00:29:30]  fist fighting should probably ensue sometime soon well we're hoping for that you know let's be honest  we we felt like we needed some attention for this radio show so we went with the hacky gas thing but  we said all right just make it free gas right yeah would you like to talk to the news 12 guys uh not  really for what for what reason hi why aren't you good enough to get on a big station  if you represent the uh the show don't say anything stupid though yeah yeah okay don't say anything

[00:39:00]  and um she goes oh we can't hear the the nav so she turned the volume up and i must have had an awful  station on like uh top tracks or one of those xm channels and uh and it was uh it was rio speedwagon  i think it was that song that was just playing which one isn't all out of love one of their  no that's uh yeah air supply that was it was a bad real bad rio song what was it riding the storm  out no that would that would have been rocking compared to the one that uh it came on riding

[00:46:00]  call and we should have called it caller the why i uh coincidentally enough also uh the veterinarian  out there let me guess another story about jill well when we were out there uh dr dr greco was his  name he's uh the vet the vet uh that neutered and spayed uh the two cats yeah uh and i got to watch  the procedure yeah and uh beforehand i i found out that the good doctor uh his wife had called our show 
[00:46:30]  um a while back to play gay or not gay really yeah and it turns out that he um and his uh friend  who's also a guy um uh were collecting orchids together and we dubbed it gay oh well we dubbed  uh the doctor gay and um then orc orchids look like you know well they're very feminine flower picking 
[00:47:00]  with a male friend good point good point you know so we we had dubbed it uh gay and then as i was  watching the procedure uh i'm watching the female cat being spayed first they cut open the the abdomen  they shave it and stuff and and then uh they're they're the guy's probing and he's pulling out the  uterus and stuff and i started going oh boy i'm gonna throw up and pass out yeah i i i completely i got a  cold sweat i felt like i was gonna puke and i had to leave the room i go i have to tap out i gotta 
[00:47:30]  tap out and i had to walk outside and drink water and cool off and uh then he dubbed me uh gay because  i couldn't sit through the procedure when jill was able to just sit and watch the entire thing without  a problem already there for her when she needs you what do you mean you know it was a tough time for  her maybe a bit stressful and you were there you were there for her you're already there for her for  those uh important things granted you folded like a cheap tent under pressure i really i can't take  that kind of gruesome like yeah yeah that kind of stuff doesn't uh yeah mister i'll shoot someone 
[00:48:00]  that walks in the house oh god they're shaving the kitty i'll be outside oh good god oh good  grieve is he okay is he okay he's shaving the kitty you ass and in between like you're putting water  on his face and he's he's like bent over just tell me the cat's gonna be okay  and then the male cat already has a vested interest in our cats they've known each other for 36 hours 
[00:48:30]  well the male cat then had to be uh neutered yeah which uh i didn't want to to watch at all  um did you make his and her necklaces out of the testicles  i really didn't want to watch that uh at all but um i did watch them pop one out  yeah and uh it's just i want to know how fun thing to watch i want to know how whipped uh she is  it's obvious you're in deep but uh you mean in deep yeah i'll keep on new 12 right now if you're

[00:51:30]  why did he borrow his wife's hat opie and anthony this is jill nicolini i just want to say anthony cumia i love you  you're checking out the opie and anthony show we're gonna get back to the anthony thing in a little  bit gonna talk more about uh jimmy's hbo taping last night in a little bit maybe talk about my  birthday a little bit and other things uh but in studio we got chris bell i gotta tell you something 
[00:52:00]  about chris bell roland uh is always handing uh mostly jimmy and i you know movies that are coming  out and stuff and uh roland you gotta thank him he goes uh there's a movie called bigger stronger  faster that's coming out limited release may 30th website bigger stronger faster movie.com  and uh roland kept pushing he's like you really should check out this movie and i finally did  and i gotta tell you i loved it and uh chris bell who uh did the movies in uh studio and it's pretty 
[00:52:30]  much him taking on um steroids uh taking on uh supplements uh taking on uh what's what's real  in this world and um wow i was blown away i gotta tell you uh you were you were brought up with um  uh your two brothers and you guys got obsessed with uh uh with uh wrestling and arnold schwarzenegger  and uh trying to to get like uh you know a solid body together when i was a little kid i grew up 
[00:53:00]  watching hulk hogan rip off his shirt tan and larger than life and i was a fat pale kid from  poughkeepsie so for me that was um something i was always trying to obtain i was trying to become  bigger stronger faster and then when kind of the curtain got pulled back on me when i was about 15  16 years old i realized every single one of my heroes stallone and hulk hogan arnold schwarzenegger  and all these guys were using anabolic steroids right and what's interesting about that you had  hulk hogan on tv talking about taking your vitamins and you could pretty much look like me 
[00:53:30]  and right well it's a lot more than vitamins we found out yeah and and he finally had to admit that  he got that body from steroids absolutely and you know in the film we kind of explore um this  attitude of america's win-at-all-cost culture through the steroid issue in america right and and  you they even mentioned like uh well you mentioned even popeye like even popeye had all right yeah  spinach to be gum you know what he was in in in cartoon land yeah so uh so then you just decided 
[00:54:00]  to do a movie on steroids and really get to to the bottom of uh you know the issues right it's something  that always affected me ever since i was i was young i was always looking at these larger than life  heroes or the super ripped guys in the magazine and i didn't look like that and i wanted to to be like  that so i became a power lifter and i started lifting weights and bench press 500 pounds before  i ever even tried steroids and then my brothers and i all went down that road where we all tried  steroids right uh i was the only one that actually stopped using them and i basically stopped using  them just after a couple of months and my brothers continued to use them for years and my younger 
[00:54:30]  brother just bench pressed uh 800 pounds and so it's 800 pounds yeah and they addressed that in the  movie because uh i don't know what happens but my younger brother guys sorry his nickname is smelly  and we call him smelly in the movie and when you pick on your younger brother and call him smelly  he kind of grew up to be a monster yeah i think in in the face of his two brothers beating him up all  the time yeah how big a guy is he he's about six one about 300 pounds is he smelly or is it just like 
[00:55:00]  an old nickname that's stuck it's an old nickname that's stuck and he ventures 800 pounds yeah and squats  1,050 so he broke every record in in california but it just goes to show you that in the sport of  powerlifting they don't test for steroids and since there's no money in powerlifting really  it's not a big deal and you look at major league baseball and you know the olympics and all these  other things where there's billions of dollars at stake and it becomes a big deal because suddenly  it's it's cheating but i kind of examine how in powerlifting if people aren't making money off  of it nobody seems to care if anybody's cheating it's kind of just and they don't test for any of 
[00:55:30]  that stuff amazing not in powerlifting not in pro bodybuilding you know because there's a there's  a point in the movie where uh smelly is uh thinking about uh not doing steroids anymore and it was his  his last match and i don't want to give stuff away here his last match before he uh might stop doing  steroids and uh you interviewed some of the other powerlifters and and you said something like well  what do you think is going to happen to smelly and they basically said so long to smelly because  without the steroids he's not going to be able to really compete in this sport yeah simple as that 
[00:56:00]  and i think quite honestly i i think that that's what's happening in a lot of sports we saw in  baseball the numbers go down when you know they crack down on steroids i think a lot of this is  actually going to come out in the open and i hope that the movie uh really opens that up and and let  people start talking about this in a more intelligent way because you have congress pounding their fist on  the table saying there's something simply un-american about this when there's really nothing more  american than doing whatever it takes to win right and i just wanted to examine that and try to figure out  where steroids kind of fit in our culture and and try to just get people talking about it but chris what 
[00:56:30]  about like uh we had canseco and and jose canseco has his whole take on steroids like if you do them  right they're healthy uh is he completely off or is he right that if you do them like correctly and  how they're supposed to be used they can be okay well i again i have to stress i'm not a doctor but um  i interviewed all the experts basically in the film and i looked at um i examined if these if steroids are  actually healthy human growth hormone if it could be healthier or useful for you know certain people 
[00:57:00]  and we found that in adult males we're not talking about teenagers and we're not we're not talking  about women in adult males um that there are the side effects are very temporary and reversible  um and for the most part and so when you abuse any drug you're going to run into problems and  that's what we examined in the films the difference between use and abuse and kind of this you know this  anti-aging industry but we have this anti-aging industry so-called anti-aging industry where  you can take human growth hormone or testosterone if you're aging and you know your hormone levels  are dropping but in the same context a lot of the doctors involved in that are quacks and they're 
[00:57:30]  you know they're just basically randomly prescribing stuff and you see all these pharmacies getting  busted all these things going on and i wanted to examine you know if this is actually good for you  why are these guys quacks why why isn't the fda stepping in and saying let's try to figure this out  like let's all try to figure this out as a society right and uh getting back to steroids and baseball  obviously that's uh illegal and all that but uh you point out that cortisone shots aren't and uh  it's been proven that those a cortisone shot is quite dangerous right well absolutely i mean they have 
[00:58:00]  to take a cortisone shot inject dye into you to figure out where it goes in the in your body and then  they inject the shot way deep into your into your joint or wherever you seem to have the problem  and what happens with um cortisone is actually it's breaking down muscle it's a catabolic steroid  as opposed to an anabolic steroid which builds muscle so if an athlete gets hurt uh and they're  on the injured reserve list it might actually suit them a lot better to to be on anabolic steroids for  a little while to rehab rather than be on corticosteroids which are breaking down the 
[00:58:30]  muscles and actually making them weaker right so we have no problem with letting people break stuff  down and get weaker or take uh painkillers and vicodin and all these other things but you know as we're  talking about therapeutic uses of of performance enhancing drugs there are therapeutic uses and that's why we  try to explore this because it seems like people want to keep these drugs away from athletes when  as athletes may be the ones that actually need them the most and we're denying these people um medical  treatment based on their jobs which in any other facet is is absolutely ridiculous like we wouldn't look 
[00:59:00]  at it like hey you're a radio host you can't take that certain pill or something you know it's based on  their on their job because it can increase performance that part of the movie uh blew me away too because he  went through a bunch of uh professions and what they do to be better at what they do and and and the  air force it's legal for those guys to be on what again i don't they take uh dextra amphetamine which  is a you know an amphetamine basically and it's not actually they are allowed to take amphetamines  they're actually required to carry amphetamines in the airplane and uh there's been a couple of 
[00:59:30]  incidents where people got a little jumpy and pulled the trigger a little too quick and people died  right and so you know we examine this you know america's win it all cost culture like i said and  you know we have an air force and people are up flying in their planes and they're they're taking  amphetamines is that safe is it safe for you but they're taking it to make their jobs better and  that that's that's that's like yeah to perform better and that's the key to the you know that  and supposedly we're the only air force that has that in the world or something we're the only air  force that allows their pilots to be on amphetamines results are good though you gotta be honest 
[01:00:00]  air force we tend to have air superiority but they're all doing crank like truckers oh yeah i  i have no problem with that but that's that's the point he's making in this movie that there's a lot  of you know uh professions out there that are doing whatever it takes to be better at their jobs like  even you went as low as like not low uh but you you explored musicians and what they're taking  to perform better in an orchestra yeah you know orchestra musicians or or symphony musicians 
[01:00:30]  they're using um beta blockers because it basically uh blocks the the flow of adrenaline  to the heart and a lot of these guys are you know they're nervous and they get up there and  they're they're kind of nerdy and they're they're afraid to be in front of an audience and so they  take this beta blocker so it just relieves all that stage fright and all that tension that they have  and it allows them to actually perform and i said to them well look you know what if a kid in a  marching band decides that because you're taking these drugs that he wants to take them sort of like  barry bonds and the guy actually laughs at me you know nobody's gonna do that and i'm like well how 
[01:01:00]  do you know because you're these are the same people that are preaching like steroids are bad  don't do steroids because they they teach kids to do steroids and you know everybody else is on a drug  and my younger brother smelly in the movie says everybody's on a drug why am i the bad guy right  right i said because you're on steroids and that that's you know the steroids have this stigma  in america that they are so bad and they're so wrong and i just wanted to kind of explore that and  not to condone it or anything just kind of say why has this happened why you know because lia  alzado blamed it on steroids is that the reason and they can't really prove that steroids is bad 
[01:01:30]  right for the most part well there's that the problem is that there's not enough studies and  they need to do more research right so you know if you want to really explore whether steroids are  good or bad you just need to put more research what exactly causes roid rage because you hear that  term all the time guys who do roids want to you know put in the fist or a wall what is it what  causes roid rage really is the media because it's actually a non-medical term it's a term that was made  up by the media to kind of demonize steroids um you know we've always said in you know in context 
[01:02:00]  of uh steroids can increase increase aggression they're a hormone so hormones affect moods so if  you're already you know an angry guy you're going to be a more angry guy or you know a super jerk  rather than being just a jerk you know let me let me jump in because like reefer madness uh you know  roid rage he he showed a scene from uh an after school type special movie was it was that uh ben affleck  yeah it was ben affleck on on roids having roid rage just completely losing his effing mind  destroying his house it was hilarious what made him so angry did he see his latest script 
[01:02:30]  it was hilarious and he beat up his girlfriend yeah it was just so over the top ridiculous like  this is what happens just like uh reefer madness did back in the day this is what will happen if  you're on steroids and the media loves to use uh the word steroids uh you had a wonderful montage  about uh you know how they they add steroids into into everything to make it uh ominous and  everything's on steroids yes and that's all of a sudden cool though because you would never see  somebody say this is our suv on crack or this is our suv on cocaine but they'll say they'll say this 
[01:03:00]  is our suv on steroids because steroids in in certain contexts are are used to actually amplify  something or make something you know look better right what's with the testicle shrinking because  that's it that's a side effect they say happens tell me no no no that oh the shower is cold get  out of here but no that they say that it does shrink your testicles is that true is it a myth  absolutely what happens is when you uh when you inject testosterone from an outside source  such as anabolic steroids what happens is your natural testosterone production shuts down 
[01:03:30]  and that your testes are what produces testosterone so the testicles will shrink as soon as you get off  of the drug the testicles will go back to the normal size and how long of doing them before  your testicles shrink like is it like almost immediately or do you have to like be on them  for a while if you're on them for like a couple weeks you'll but it's not like they're going to  shrink down to nothing and then you know come back it's they they definitely will shrink a little  bit and then you know come back a little bit there's actually a a guy who has done studies in 
[01:04:00]  measuring them which i don't know i don't want to get involved in yeah no kidding where can you find  him at suckyjobs.com the world's most dangerous jobs i laughed out loud because they were showing  some female bodybuilders and and they're happy that they still look feminine and i'm like have  you seen yourself in the mirror what are you talking about i think that's a lot of like this  body dysmorphia which we talk about which goes both ways you see a guy looking in the mirror and  he sees a giant you know and he's a little skinny 110 pound guy and then you see vice versa some you 
[01:04:30]  know a lot i got a lot of guys at the gym coming up to me and they're huge and they're just going like  hey bro how do i get as big as you and i'm like you're three times the size of me what are you  talking about and they just don't see themselves sure as big enough and so you see that in in both  ways and then the women's really funny because these women get out of control on steroids and  steroids are terrible for women because they're male hormones and so for women to take male hormones  there's a lot of problems that occur you know right i would gather i've seen the porn videos they  have a certain features that get a little larger yeah i don't mind that though that's kind of a thing 
[01:05:00]  for me but that that explains china and what was going on down there i'm thinking yeah and that's  the thing i'm thinking because you say that that part of the body gets bigger on if you're on roids  absolutely and what happens is um you know when when you're taking steroids as a woman that's  irreversible oh really you know your balls shrink they'll come back to normal if it enlarges your  clitoris it's not going to shrink back down you know to normal after you get off the steroids  also it roughens the skin for women it does a lot of things that you know they should really  seriously look into before they get involved in taking steroids i like that you were brave enough 
[01:05:30]  to go after um arnold schwarzenegger as well well arnold was one of my heroes growing up and then  i you know i actually voted for him i saw that living in california i live in venice california and  i voted for him and then i go into gold's gym and they're pulling all the arnold's posters off the  wall and i said what's going on here and they said oh well arnold is is basically looking for money  for these photos because we don't have the license to them and i said well why is he doing that and  basically it was a move to get gold's gym to remove all the posters because arnold doesn't want  to be associated with bodybuilding anymore well he's distancing himself uh uh from the steroid 
[01:06:00]  controversy uh just to explain to people this gym uh in california gold's gym where arnold uh you  know made his name ever since arnold made his name they've had like a shrine to him basically all over  gold's gym and when he was re-elected yeah when he was re-elected he told everybody to take all his  crap out of gold's gym it was a it was an actually a big deal in the in the you know bodybuilding  community yeah it's very did this and it's kind of very emotional for us meatheads that go right 
[01:06:30]  gold's gym and looking up at the wall and arnold's no longer there and he was always i think an  inspiration to all of us and he's always been a hero to me yeah and while he's trying to distance  himself from bodybuilding he's also at the same time saying we need to crack down on steroids and  at the same time sponsoring a bodybuilding competition in which every single competitor  is on steroids and his name's on that competition right and uh but you you wanted to get arnold for  your movie he didn't uh return the calls and he finally has a chance to confront arnold on steroids  and i gotta laugh at you you kind of blew it yeah well yeah what happens is listen to this story man 
[01:07:00]  what happens is uh you know we we called arnold several times and we got into his you know we got  to his office we got anywhere and um finally i go down to muscle beach because he's going to present  this award to joe weeder who founded the muscle fitness magazines and everything and i get down to  muscle beach and finally arnold's there and he's right in front of me and he grabs my arm and i'm  shaking hands with him kind of like the uh old predator where he's like you son of a bitch and  dylan yeah yeah and so uh we totally kind of reenact that scene and i'm standing there hold 
[01:07:30]  him and i'm about to ask him a question and he like kind of turns around and and walks away and  in that same very moment a guy starts snapping pictures and he goes what's your name and i said  what what did i do wrong i'm chris bell what's the matter and he goes i'm from the la times going  to be on the cover of the la times with the governor tomorrow so while i couldn't confront arnold or ask  him the questions i wanted to ask him i somehow weirdly ended up on the cover of the la times  with him showing off your bicep with arnold schwarzenegger the one thing that he did say to  me was look at those arms look at those arms yeah you know uh two others we should bring steve in 
[01:08:00]  here because he's on all those supplements uh but before that get steve but before that uh you showed  this uh this cow in in in this movie and i think if you go to uh that's a bad segue from steve by the  way i know oh god if you go to if you go to biggerstrongerfastermovie.com uh the trailer shows  the cow this thing is a freak of nature it's basically a cow with double the the muscle mass  that that they're engineering it has a double muscling gene and so what we talk about in the 
[01:08:30]  movies this is a belgian blue bull and a belgian blue bull weighs about 2900 pounds it's all muscle  and it's all natural it's on no steroids whatsoever it's genetically enhanced it basically has a  a certain gene and they're identifying that gene in human beings it's called myostatin  and with lower it's actually with lower levels of myostatin it's kind of like a governor on a car  right it's like how fast you can go and if you take that governor off so if you lower your myostatin  levels basically your body can get bigger and bigger and bigger increasing in size to who knows what 
[01:09:00]  you know proportions and so they're actually using this to cure these poor kids with muscular dystrophy  and at the same time the same scientist that's trying to cure kids with muscular dystrophy he's getting  phone calls from crazy football coaches around the country wanting to guinea pig their their football  teams on this stuff and it's like no way man i can't do that like ethically you know that would  be totally yeah you know i'd go to jail forever sure and so it's just interesting that we live in this  culture where we start developing these drugs for these good causes and it's kind of always like it's  almost like we're getting into the superhero realm of like if it falls into the wrong hands you know and 
[01:09:30]  you know who knows what will happen because we don't we don't have studies and stuff right and it just  looks like a cow like a like it looks like a bodybuilder yeah you got a bodybuilder cow you  got to see this thing it's where it's ripped the cow is ripped the worst thing is it doesn't even work  out it just stands in a field right ass you gotta i train every day and it looks way better than i  know this is radio but when it pops up on our screen where we're looking at the trailer right now  jimmy's gonna have a quite a reaction because this thing is ridiculous looking and you know where it 
[01:10:00]  is or it's coming up okay yeah and we'll uh put the trailer up on onaradio.com actually it's already  up there see we update onaradio.com as we go now thanks to uh stunt brain uh where's there you go  oh my god look at that thing it looks like a bowl well it's it's a bowl armor plated it looks  armored plated right yeah it looks like a giant armadillo sure yeah it's all muscle and um it's  definitely like they they show these these bowls in competitions they're they're kind of award-winning 
[01:10:30]  amazing and then finally uh the supplement uh businesses i didn't know that it was a 23 billion  dollar a year business i think in the movie we say uh we mark it as a 24 billion 24 billion okay  industry and um it's basically an industry that's sort of unregulated yeah in a way that um you know  basically anything that's found in the food supply that's not a banned substance is allowed to be a  dietary supplement and you can market it however you want you could take a guy that you know is on 
[01:11:00]  steroids and put him in the ad and say this guy took so and so product and that's how he got the  way that he looks and blown off the fact that he's actually you know uh well putting needles in his  butt and actually an interesting story one of my friends spoke to me in the film and he was very  honest this guy christian boving he worked for a company called muscle tech so he spoke to me in  the film and he was actually fired from his uh position as a spokesmodel for muscle tech because he  spoke to me in the movie and they saw it on cnn and what he basically says is uh yeah of course i 
[01:11:30]  take supplements i take all their supplements but of course i take steroids too because  if anybody thinks they're going to take a pill and look like me you should be smarter than that  and so his company basically released him and said you can't talk about steroids we don't support  steroids it's the same company that sponsors the mr olympia contest and going back to not drug testing  the mr olympia doesn't drug test so it's full of steroids so you have the mr olympia contest full of  steroids sponsored by muscle tech yet they're going to fire their spokesman because he actually  was honest about something wow and the supplement business it all takes place in utah a lot of it 
[01:12:00]  takes place in utah like about about a quarter of it yeah they they make most of the supplements in  utah well everything comes from china everything comes right and it was funny because he was walking  through one of the lead muscles he was walking through one of these like health food type of  places and you were just pointing out everything you've tried in the supplement uh business all the  power shakes and uh and muscle milk and all this stuff you're like oh i did that did that try that  try that try that and then a really funny scene he got a couple uh mexicans from like outside uh home 
[01:12:30]  depot and decided to make his own supplement because that's how easy it is to do you just buy the raw  ingredients mix it up however the hell you want put a cool label on it and while you know and take a  picture and you're ready to go and what you put on the side is a proprietary blend right proprietary blend  means you got to list the uh ingredients but you don't actually have to say how much is in there  so you can do these like little techniques to kind of exploit that i should say that there are a lot  of great supplements out there and i use a lot of supplements uh but i basically know what i'm using  them for and i think people just need to uh understand and acknowledge what the dietary supplement 
[01:13:00]  business is and what they can use to actually help them achieve their goals well i i gotta say i gotta be  careful too because i work out obviously and uh i do a lot of time on the elliptical yeah and i take  a fish oil pill and a vitamin b complex am i hurting myself back to you i don't think so i mean uh you  know like i said certain supplements like fish oil has been shown to be very beneficial to lower the  risk of heart attacks and cholesterol and all these things and you know let's look at you know let's say  like fish oil for example it's a great could be a great supplement but there's a lot of crappy 
[01:13:30]  companies out there that are not regulated so we don't know that the amount of fish oil it's saying  that's in the capsule is actually in there and that's the problem it's like we don't know what we're  getting ever yeah uh you gotta talk to steve get him off the half he comes he comes in here sweating  half half the time well the sweating is from it's from a lot of the coffee but i used to take a lot  of the fat burner supplements i'm off off most of them now um like hydroxy cuts and uh and a lot of  the ephedra based stuff before it was banned yeah well now now a lot of what i do is it's just vitamins 
[01:14:00]  like a power pack of vitamins every day it's like clat gla omega-369 flaxseed oil uh garlic ester  c a multivitamin and that's three times a day so it's like 33 pills a day and then and then you  burp that all up and these guys probably walk around disgusted at you right yeah well it's not  it's not it's not the most appetizing thing yeah well the problem with a lot of these vitamins and  these these minerals and stuff we like i said we don't have a lot of studies on this stuff right a  lot of them you can't really absorb so you can take a lot of these vitamins and the reason why you 
[01:14:30]  you burp them up or you know you pee and it's like totally you know lime green it looks like lemon  lime gatorade is because you're not absorbing them and your body's actually just rejecting them so a lot of these  supplements i'm not saying like good or bad it's just saying we don't really have enough knowledge  to know is it true though you could get uh uh vitamins that are more water solvent or something  like that that will you'll get more benefits from it joe rogan was telling us that a lot of the a lot  of the guys that work in the sewers they laugh because they see nothing but multivitamins completely  whole they just come out of you they they barely break down because they're packing so much crap into 
[01:15:00]  these vitamins i think there's a lot of couple a lot of supplement companies out there working on  getting uh vitamins with better absorption right right but the best way to get vitamins is from  eating whole foods eating fruits and vegetables and and things old-fashioned way yeah yeah we don't  we don't do that anymore at all everything we have in america now is processed and that's  one of the reasons why we have a you know such a high obesity rate is everything's processed and  your body doesn't process that as well right well the movie's called uh bigger stronger faster i i really  like this uh movie a lot i thought it was very very interesting uh chris chris bell uh website 
[01:15:30]  biggerstrongerfastermovie.com limited release is may 30th and i guess you can get a list of where  you can see it on the website yeah on the website also uh magnolia magnolia pictures is our distributor  right and it's uh magpictures.com and they have a whole list of the rollout and where it's going to  be great and you've got some backing it was uh the producers that produced uh fahrenheit 911 and uh  bowling for columbine absolutely yeah jim jim zarneski and kurt angfer were our um co-producers on the  project and they did such a great job at kind of helping us tell this story and the one thing i should say 
[01:16:00]  is that uh i wanted to tell a story that was right down the middle so i wanted to kind of take what  what michael does and and actually show both sides of it and let everybody speak on the on the issue  and let everybody come out and and try to figure it out for it's kind of refreshing when you see a  documentary there's no agenda i mean it was like make up your own uh mind for the most part you weren't  trying to say steroids are bad or steroids you're right just what you said well i think that you know  as a filmmaker i see films and i'm preached to a lot and i don't want to yeah i don't like that i just 
[01:16:30]  want to i want to know like what are the facts and then let me know and i'll make a decision at  the end very cool chris bell everyone thank you chris thank you guys all right we'll continue just  a bit opian anthony the opian anthony show  we got a real busy morning you're checking out the opian anthony show we got gallagher he's going to  be on the show in a few minutes here and uh we got a gas promotion going on i hear there's a cluster f  somewhere yeah i think keith's going to be uh calling in with that where's the gas do we need to

[01:32:00]  you're an ass of one man's inability to distinguish a voice from a fart you're talking out your ass the ass  whisperer coming soon oh stop it to the opian anthony show  it's the opian anthony show we've got lots going on we got basil teas here cooking breakfast once  again hooper avenue toms river new jersey want to thank uh steven farley for uh cooking up the eggs and 
[01:32:30]  the uh the steak and uh pancakes not bad right a little bit everything nice we got gallagher in  studio and he was commenting that uh this is a little different than other radio shows  appetite is uh the smell you need to smell this is why we eat the turkey at two o'clock because you  can't last till five when you've smelled it cooking all day it's uh part of my idea to have a family 
[01:33:00]  reunion resort you know this would be a big room surrounded by bedrooms with a kitchen there for  communing and bonding and cooking and having reunions uh and getting the kids off the street  from joining gangs by realizing they already belong to a gang their extended family it's what i'm doing  in the second half of my life here instead of being known as the guy that smashed watermelons i want to  bring america's families together good good idea huh good good luck with that one well  that's a hell of an introduction do you have ideas on how to uh accomplish that uh sure i uh talk 
[01:33:30]  about it on the radio oh okay yeah and it gives the the idea out there i'm quite an inventor and a  visionary you know i have a new toilet that you can't throw the toilet paper in and back up and this  saves water i made a contract with niagara toilets are being built right now in china you you really  have an invention it's just a uh a chamber behind the water that the kids can't get to with a float 
[01:34:00]  in it and a rod that turns the water off when it comes up in the bowl but combined with niagara's  wonderful uh trough that they have so the water doesn't touch the flapper in the bottom well of  course and so when it you dump it over it it doesn't leak you see combining the two of them it's  going to be a wonderful new toilet for the bars you know they always do it at the bars you go in  there and you're it's messy and they jam up the toilet keep flushing and then it overflows invention 
[01:34:30]  for the new uh slot machines uh for this generation of kids that's gonna uh go into the casino and  realize that the video isn't as involving as their games at home i was just at the ces convention in  vegas and they had these beautiful games on the screens you know demonstrating the new uh screens  and then i walked in the casino and i thought there's a hundred years difference here between  the technology this new generation of kids aren't going to be interested in these slot machines so i 
[01:35:00]  came up with new software imagine three watermelons are coming down to the pay line right on a gallagher  slot machine they could uh burst break in half or or uh or bounce and you're a winner when the action  matches and not just the icon say naked or just bikini girls are coming down on parachutes and when  they hit the pay line their boobs continue or one boob continues or their boobs break off and bounce back  it's involving it's fun and then it has to match has to match say three birds are flying down to an 
[01:35:30]  electric wire they either get electrocuted and their feathers fly off or the hunter shoots them  as a hole in them or they squat and lay an egg it could be involving and and fun for everybody and  i'm trying to make the world a better place you decided i'm sorry are you still doing stand-up or  you only concentrate on inventions now i mean i know you're doing the stress factor it doesn't  hey going to a bar late at night and telling jokes uh is not a real big problem you know i got all day 
[01:36:00]  to i mostly trade stocks until the market closes it does inventing something all over the place are  you a day trader sure yeah but i like i like to investigate what america is doing nobody's saying  anything about obama and hillary having a full schedule you know anybody can i like to work i maybe  sleep a couple hours but i mean inventing something just takes a moment just takes a moment obama he  needs to be a totally black guy though to get the black vote you think but then hillary's not 
[01:36:30]  totally a white i mean uh a lady you know it's hard to find a total thing in america you can't name  one thing that's absolutely all the way one thing uh that's what i talk about wow i think in my act  i'm sure you can lunatic i'm not a lunatic you are but it's not a bad thing of course you are i am  not the world is a lunatic how about these kids don't pull their pants up how stupid is it to walk 
[01:37:00]  around with your butt hanging out you can't run from the cops with your pants half off true uh how dumb  is uh the sports i mean can you figure out what's a hard foul and a flagrant foul is it clear no and it's  and it's important it's a judgment it's important i do agree and the kids in chicago didn't know the  difference between a spectator and a player they lean over the outfield ruin the cubs chance of going  to the world series i've been talking to umpires and they admit and they admit that the strike zone is 
[01:37:30]  larger than the plate they've changed the rules you know it's got to be wider plus we don't you  talked about steroids should the records stand that uh were made before steroids or after why not  because athletes have been cheating all along yeah it's always there's always been something  with the rules they've always been how about that you want to talk about an idiot well yeah governor  that doesn't know what's going to trigger an investigation and that's his area you know 
[01:38:00]  clinton called him and said you were paying for it what happened to spitzer  did you get hit with your own mallet why i'm just wondering no i brought this along because i  want to point out it's going to cost me five thousand dollars a year to check this damn thing now  it's uh i take 200 flights it's going to be 25 bucks uh every time you do have uh an airport baggage 
[01:38:30]  thing on there just check it you got to check it yeah right you check the the gallagher mallet well  they wouldn't let him carry that on i wouldn't think i used to i used to just you know come on  board and put it in the overhead and there were pretty girls waiting on me in the aisle and the  men drove the plane but now the girls are the pilots and the guys are in the aisle coming up and  down i told you there i look like a lunatic because i'm a smart reasonable person in another rise  ridiculous in an insane society uh a sane man must appear insane right that's from 
[01:39:00]  spa star trek everybody how smart does everybody look owning a truck as the price of gas goes up to  four and five dollars exactly that's my sentiment exactly yeah everybody with a truck was looking  really stupid now yeah yeah well that's for sure what are you driving these days anything well i rent  cars a jet i rent cars he's driving everyone crazy that's what he's driving i am because i can solve  the world's problem lower california you know the bay of california they're the baja yeah that's a 
[01:39:30]  perfect place to put a dam and get all that salt water out of there and have a whole new fertile valley  so the mexicans can grow avocados and almonds and never even come up into california in the gulf of  california yeah because it's it's been you're saying drain the gulf of california half of it  halfway down halfway down there's some islands so you know it's shallow there uh gotcha the  colorado river drains into there and it's full of fertilizer that comes off the fields in arizona 
[01:40:00]  and colorado some fertile land under there and underneath it is all those eons of the colorado  coming in there the silt must be it must be rich and full and the the drug lords could run this because  they're not going to stop growing cocaine and marijuana until they make money at something  else and avocados and almonds are the second and third thing that i pay for they're so hard to  snort marijuana and cocaine that's right that's gonna be a tough style though to the drug lord look  no it isn't away from coke into avocado they want it just like the corleone's they want to straighten 
[01:40:30]  out the family and leave them a legitimate business plus it's in mexico that's corrupt they can  pay for it and you know al gore's not going down there and say we've got wallowing whales that need  this give you that we need more arable land for food i'm sure there wouldn't be one environmentalist  that would uh try to argue the impact of damming off the gulf of california but you can't continually 
[01:41:00]  uh turn farmland into suburbs well no you run out of farmland here's an idea that creates new farmland  come on all right i'm digging this already let's go what is it no i'm draining that thing  oh that idea that i wasn't what's the matter with that uh listen i apologize because uh our our  executive chef steven over there he brought in some watermelon and i'm sure at this point in your  in your career you don't really like looking at watermelon do you know i'm gonna be smashing  it over at the stress factory yeah stress back you are there actually by the way friday and saturday 
[01:41:30]  uh tonight tomorrow no no friday and saturday friday saturday are you doing sunday too right and  sunday wow look at that stressfactory.com seven three two five four five ha ha you're gonna how  how many hbl specials have you done i mean you've done a lot of specials i did 14 and they're all  available on four dvds in one box for a lousy 20 bucks what if your life uh amounted to 20 20 bucks  14 hours on hbl that's right because i'm not afraid to try new material all the time these comics that go 
[01:42:00]  up and do their set without ever taking a chance don't grow just say rich boss artist that but i do  i'll try something new all of the time listening to you talk i could see where the being prolific  comes in because i could tell the way your mind works you're going from agriculture to the toilets  i mean obviously your head's always moving so that there there's there plus it's radio we've got  to keep this moving how many you get these interview in here and you ask them a question 
[01:42:30]  they answer it really quick and yes nothing to go on and it's dead air they'll say yes or no  now i have a reason to be on the radio i want people people to think you know america's uh  tradition is to be an inventor and not to follow others that's communism they should be individuals  and not follow trends fads and fashions now now you did invent a lot of uh gag things for for your  show wait a minute what about the whole idea of smashing people steve win just built a hotel in 
[01:43:00]  vegas with a swimming pool in the middle of his theater in the round where do you get that idea  did he pay me for it no they hand out towels i went to the show there because they dropped pretty  girls into the pool and they said do you mind getting splashed i said i invented it  what the hell are you talking about well i'm just thinking because now now now you're getting into like  legitimate inventions were you doing that all the time even during the time you were  uh inventing you know the tricycle with the window i've been trying my whole life yeah to be active 
[01:43:30]  this stops and you finally hit with a crapper hey it's a toilet is it true the toilet that you  that the that the the sledge-o-matic was originally you invented that for carlin and he said no is that  is that a rumor is it no hey he yeah he knows it i sent it to his address in uh venice florida and  he sent me back a letter he's the nicest guy besides richard prior in show business most 
[01:44:00]  everybody's a jerk but um but a lot of people hated prior my i adore prior but a lot of people  thought he was a rough one to deal with no the first time i met him he invited me over to his  house with everybody else on saturday to have chicken and cocaine and uh and i went and it was  great who don't you like in who don't like everybody everybody well name a few well we  love naming names in this show we talk about all the people we hate in our business yeah i don't  necessarily hate them i just don't respect them as uh like oh like you well there was an interview 
[01:44:30]  you did in the in the origami where they talked about doing certain comics you were bad-mouthing  like i wasn't bad-mouthing i was telling the truth okay if i was a reviewer fair enough tell  the truth well jim carrey would you get in a tree and spread your cheeks to express your comic talent  i mean what art is this that you know if i was making that movie about the the uh dog uh or the  animal uh guy the veterinarian ace ventura yeah pet detective pet detective yeah i wouldn't say oh i 
[01:45:00]  can hardly wait to be on a full screen standing on a limb spreading my cheek jim carrey yeah that's got  that's the lowest form of comedy you don't say before me no one was funny until i showed them  their butt everybody knew the butt was a joke you know that is correct but i gotta say carrey is great  i'm not necessarily a huge character but he's great at what he does like the stooges are great at what  they do slapstick what does he do he over acts all of the actors that work with him in the movies 
[01:45:30]  stepped back because they were all trying to be subtle and real jim is just going over the top with  everything and making it nutty and uh gallagher's making sense here you think it's over it's too  much i think he's right about jim carrey like that really well i watched him when he see i saw  everybody when they first came to the comedy store i saw uh letterman well i know them all from the  very beginning and i know whether they're you know naturally funny or not and jim was painful when he 
[01:46:00]  get on stage because his stuff doesn't work in a nightclub and when uh dice clay came out uh you  know he had to work his act up and and and robin williams had no material he's just a comic actor and  so he needs the comedians to show him what's funny i i saw him take joke areas and redo them and then uh  one joke that he took of mine was uh uh i used to say that uh old people should smoke dope because 
[01:46:30]  it makes the time go slow well dave letterman had a talk show out in la at one time and it didn't  work and he had robin on and robin saw the ashtray on the coffee table and he grabbed it and pretended  to drink it and he said good makes time go slow and i knew he got that from me but he just took the  punchline you see and he just but that's what he reworked it a little bit yeah well you got to be  kind of a good writer to know what to steal but he's not really you know a prolific uh comedian he's 
[01:47:00]  an actor why else here's what's crazy about the movie business why do they get comedians to do  serious parts i mean why wouldn't you get a serious why spanglish it was terrific i gotta admit  why do all these come in first you qualify to be an actor in movies by being funny and then they give  you this serious part i think like jim carrey i think he might have wanted to get away from that  whole uh wacky guy uh image and try to be a serious actor that's why he was just using it as 20 mil 20 
[01:47:30]  mil a picture that's what it is they're making them they're proven guys the people go out and see  so then what do you just you're actually saying that the the the humanity uh the american people are  morons because they go out in droves and see his movies and why would you love them why would you  qualify to do a serious movie by spreading your cheeks in a tree then you get to be truman and we  all cry because your girlfriend left you or you live in a bubble or it sounds like you're obsessed 
[01:48:00]  with jim carrey you know all his movies well i'm using his head in with that yeah sledge-o-matic  i'm using it as an example very careful here because he is sitting there with a mallet robin  williams uh makes serious movies also he's a juilliard trained actor i mean i think that was  like his original i don't like uh robin williams stand up either i think he people laugh and they  just laugh out of thinking they should laugh because he's just coming up with stuff uh in a  rhythm he seems to be on the top off the top of his head but it's not real funny if you break it down 
[01:48:30]  and and look what he just said it's not funny conan is painful i can't believe he's getting the  tonight show because he's a terrible comic it's all about a silliness it's never a full belly laugh  you just kind of go and he had on the guy from uh the i can't remember the uh the guy in this movie  you've been talking about him this morning about the crystal head or the oh uh indiana jones right  he had harrison on there last night and it was pretty painful and boring 
[01:49:00]  and harrison ford is an awful interview i can't believe that they qualify him to take the tonight  show you know in america we take the average or or you know you just get used to getting less and  less like we used to get a nice meal on a plane and now we get a bistro bag and you have to grab  it on the way in and we used to have a wonderful anchor for the news and then we ended up with  the katie kirk who was supposed to just do the on the street kicky little cute girl thing but 
[01:49:30]  everybody else dies and she moves up and they give it to her and they finally realize she's not  an anchor and you can't just make america accept uh no quality and no competence god damn it he's  right you know what you're absolutely right that tittering crap that people pass off in comedy it  makes me sick you're absolutely right that's exactly what people are doing gallagher's making sense  somewhere in here yeah completely turn me around conan is for teenage girls that's who laughs at him 
[01:50:00]  that funny little stuff he tells a joke it doesn't get a laugh and then he does something else some  kind of he'll put his face right in the camera yeah and do something like that he's like carrot top  he'll hold show you a prop and you don't laugh at it and then you'll go come on you know like  asking for but you did say that we do laugh at uh conan how is it again the  like jerry seinfeld jokes i mean i never belly laughed at a jerry seinfeld observation you just 
[01:50:30]  really a lot of people found him uh very funny especially the fourth funniest guy on his own show  if they gave out medals he wouldn't get the prize you know what he's all right now you got me he's  making a lot of funny by the way and he was playing a comic imagine being a comic and you're  not funny on your own show everybody else gets a movie career he's a voice of a cartoon i'm a bee 
[01:51:00]  i want to call the guinness book of world records because i think we just heard the longest sentence  ever uh gallagher doesn't believe in periods it's all commas and best comic working most prolific  comic work best comic working you think i saw uh the hbo special of the guy who's the delivery  guy on uh king of queens and it was wonderful patten oswalt no uh james kevin james oh kevin james  he pretended he was in the water and he did his arms like this and screamed like a girl when the seaweed 
[01:51:30]  touched him and then he was reading a card like a woman taking a a car a birthday card or a greeting  card out wonderful pantomime use of his body uh kind of like opening your butt cheeks in a tree  no not at all this was art the art of comedy he did a wonderful wonderful job and i like the guy  that you talked about david tell david if you want to be gross and uh and pornographic you can't beat 
[01:52:00]  david tell i like i like his joke about i was having sex doggy style with this girl it wasn't anything  i planned she just fell asleep that way that's very funny to me i don't know you don't put a  content thing on a brutal or not brutal like you don't think you don't you don't think cleaner is  a higher form of the art than dirty i'll tell you what you go to that club he works in boston late at  night and you can't do a little cute jokes you got to tell a joke like that because the college students 
[01:52:30]  are there we're all drinking well i was there and uh that's the kind of comedy that you have to do at  fifth place i don't know what i'm going to be doing over there in new jersey if they're you know  sunday show might be real nice and polite and i got to do political stuff and i'll talk about  you know clinton and and uh hillary and then maybe friday night's going to be rowdy and i'll need what  he got on hillary what he got on hillary well i um i like to say that she's not uh a really a woman 
[01:53:00]  uh totally because um we all know why i mean you know uh i think she has one ball i think that  i think that's what it costs bill for the monica lewin you know you ask who's got the gonads in that  family they each have one is what i think is who's going to be the next president it's well uh the old  man john mccain because the jews are having a problem voting for an arab kind of guy with the name of bomb 
[01:53:30]  yeah i mean if you if you don't want people to think you're a terrorist get rid of the bomb part  um i mean this is pretty crazy he's he's as much a black as uh as tiger you know they're just lattes  they're only a half they're only a half if if he was really a black guy he'd have a white wife like  kobe oh my god i want to hug gallagher and uh and montel and tiger and you said tiger's not black 
[01:54:00]  though he's gonna he's gonna he has a short oriental woman if you wanted to have an athlete for a son  you know why would you have a small wife i can't believe archie manning see he has both of his sons  were quarterbacks but i don't think he married a quarterback i think he probably married uh a cocktail  waitress or a stewardess or something a pretty little girl you know to me an athlete like uh  shack he should have looked for a big hulking uh one of them big women from russia so we'd have 
[01:54:30]  another big shack instead he married this sawed-off little woman uh which he probably doesn't mind me  saying now because he's divorcing her but she was tiny i saw her on vacation what's he thinking there  she could have been more than five this is why bill walton's son is a forward instead of  la having a new center we have a forward because he married somebody short we need to they need to  think about who you're breathing almost like jimmy the greek uh well why don't they think ahead if 
[01:55:00]  they want their kid to be are you caliger are you suggesting we raise a uh you know super kids i think  a generation of super kids i'm thinking you should think about it if you want your son to drop back and  not order drinks instead pass i mean it's gotta why don't to me if i was a woman i wouldn't marry  a guy with a big head i mean just look ahead you know think about this if it's coming between your  legs get a guy with a little pea head could you imagine marrying shack god almighty what would that 
[01:55:30]  it's gonna burst you and she was little too i don't they don't think ahead i don't so you're  saying basically genetically and stuff like that you should you should think of dna and genetics yeah  there's plenty of lesbians they could have married uh from the you know with athletic abilities  where they just wanted to have a really good quarterback or a really good basketball player  i mean don't they think ahead on this now you've been have you been doing stand-up all along or 
[01:56:00]  did you stop or did you keep going you you've been doing because you've been doing it all yeah  that's what i do you see that's what i'm saying i do the hard job of entertaining people to their face  drinking which is even harder and uh the these other comics when they kick out and get a talk  show or a sitcom they're they're admitting that they can't do this it's too hard and it is hard but  i've learned to do it and i've studied it and i think i do a good job i think if you want to have  a good time uh you're going to get your money's worth with me which is the other thing i do is i keep 
[01:56:30]  my ticket price down i'm not like jerry seinfeld he's already rich why is it who's a hundred dollars  funny you tell me that who in the hell is a hundred dollars funny for just for laughing  and nobody why and plus he's already rich he's i got like a billion dollars for the replay of of  the shows of other people that were funnier than him why why does he have to charge a hundred dollars  gallagher we have to take a break please stick around yeah stress factory i've been listening to 
[01:57:00]  these sponsors and there's some pretty nuts stuff happening in this these but of course i won't  pick on your sponsor that's all right i'm just telling you there's some pretty crazy things  happening friday saturday and sunday at the stress factory in new brunswick new jersey  seven three two five four five haha uh gallagher smash.com stressfactory.com for ticket info  these will sell out it's uh it's a holiday weekend obviously uh so just get tickets because the  stress factory always sells out so but it will sell out i wouldn't be here if the ticket 
[01:57:30]  believe me we know that but it will sell out it will not and it's small i'm i'm working my way  down i was i would go to the stress factory just to watch gallagher finally lose i wouldn't be here  if the tickets were selling all right with that we gotta take a break opie and anthony stay there  we're back as obie makes his way back into the studio we're back with my new favorite person alive 
[01:58:00]  gallagher who i have been enjoying on this show with all of you and then chit chatting in uh in break  it's so refreshing to see an honesty that you just don't see uh especially in i want to i want to work  on a joke about this lou uh pearlman that they caught in malaysia ran away with the 300 million  he's already making all the money on the backstreet boys and he's got to cheat his investors but there's  got to be a joke here uh he went to malaysia which is of course a backstreet and where you can buy boys 
[01:58:30]  ask michael there's got to be a joke and they caught him in guam right because malaysia kicked him  out that's got to be a real insult that even malaysia didn't want he's going to jail for how long  uh 25 years 25 years the boy band yeah because he's older already i mean he ain't going to last  this but he was in orlando and uh and why did he have to cheat i mean it's just like spitzer  just shut up about the prostitutes or figure out a way of getting it off without everybody knowing 
[01:59:00]  you idiot uh i can't you know we wouldn't need the word stupid if it wasn't for people i never see  animals and do a stupid ever see a dog like just walk into a wall because he ain't watching  or uh you ever drop something next to a table and you reach down to pick it up and hit your face on  the table i mean it's just i see people pick stuff out of their teeth look at it and put it back in  their mouth the object was to get it out of i think this is why the flying saucers don't land they can  smell stupid somehow they've got some ray that can tell they hover over the cities and then they notice 
[01:59:30]  a traffic jam made of off-road vehicles why if you can drive anywhere would you stay in the line of  traffic you schmucks you know i mean why get a four-wheel drive and stay on and they always have  a name like they go off-road pathfinder or caravan and they're going to the yukon or something even  more out there tacoma you know or tahoe i don't think you should put hoe on the outside of your

[02:14:00]  heart research now i said well i had a heart attack and they said well you don't laugh at your jokes  it's hard to take you serious i mean you got barely any clothes on you got cake all on yourself  you're sitting in ketchup what are you trying to say gallagher what are you trying to say i'm trying  to say that you can take a man with cake on his nose okay well  it is an intelligent decision to laugh do us a favor the only animal that laughs i think we 
[02:14:30]  shouldn't think things are so damn important do us a favor uh we secretly hate vinnie at the stress  factory yeah no actually want to do this i'm gonna knock his phone off of the wall oh yes please  do that because what's on stage is seeing all the time you're doing your act that's why i hate  these comics that have to have a stool and a bottle of water how sissy george burns was 90 years  old and sucking a cigar and the sumbitch didn't need a drink while he did get rid of the water 
[02:15:00]  how presumptuous to think you can take a sip and hydrate oh you need to hydrate you know how  dehydrating comedy is now you're making fun of our uh little jimmy norton who just filmed an hbo show  you do not get thirsty you're i do a slave to trends and fashion and you think it's a tradition  to have the damn slave to trends i'm wearing a kiss shirt what are you talking about behind the  is there bricks on the wall do you do comedy in front of bricks well like the improv yeah oh cripes  and a bottle of water and a stool uh thomas overbeck from dallas writes let's take a picture to 
[02:15:30]  remember the day we spilled the ketchup we take pictures at my show i invite everybody to bring  their cameras yeah and then i teach them how to use them when you take a picture make the face big  everybody pays a lot for one of those big chips and then you don't hardly use it the damn  face is tiny tiny then they say i can zoom in it makes it grainy you schmuck you learn to use your  camera before you hand it to a stranger to take a picture with a celebrity i'm so sick and tired of 
[02:16:00]  grinning while they learn how to use it i'm tired i'm just tired you're too old for that crap right  people need to have some memories they need to have a decent life that's why i want to make the  family reunion things people are having a stupid life buildings are the set for the scenes of our  lives and we need to give people a dramatic life oh with that we gotta say yeah thanks no i can get  out here to stop and no my words of wisdom for everyone is you don't fry bacon naked  a lot of people don't know that well i guess you learn a lot of you you know people say that 
[02:16:30]  cleanliness is next to godliness i looked it up in the dictionary goggles is actually  cleanliness is next to claustrophobia and cleavage you know they say to eat before you go to the  grocery store that way you don't buy so much well that don't work with the liquor store if you go  there drunk you buy everything they got i own two little liquor stores near my house yeah  yeah i get them to turn the lights down they always have the lights too bright 
[02:17:00]  uh well i don't know what else to say is that time to go to one of the commercials that's hiding  the fact that you're really paying a lot of money with some  we're actually ending uh the show the show is over yeah we got to find someone to uh clean up this  mess but uh that's the next guy's problem that's uh you know that's how we always have looked at  you're right we walk away from this we walk away from the destruction we cause well usually you 
[02:17:30]  don't do anything visual on the radio well we do a lot of visuals yeah because we understand the  internet and then your video will be up on uh our sites and then i love it'll be viewed like crazy  i'm working on two new websites one's called smash my face when somebody uh irritates you take  their picture you send it to smash my face you mutilate it there put it back in your uh camera and show  the person what you'd like to do to them physically but you only do to them virtually and i need some  people that are artists and code writers to help to fill this thing out and my other one is called the 
[02:18:00]  dance pyramid where you take a video of yourself dancing and put it on this pyramid and people vote  on it and you work your way to the top and i think that could be some fun too i'm cutting edge  i'm with the kids thinking i am i want i'm in there i'm gonna make i know millions on that slot  machine idea as soon as the people at caesar's palace harris gives me a call hey don't make me  go to mgm don't make me go to mgm sam what do you got it was just it there's ketchup all over the  window that's all the way across the room yeah but people that's what he was trying to do who's going 
[02:18:30]  to clean the desk side here and the you know there's oil and sugar frosting that's what the problem  is that's gonna be a problem but we could get some rats with big tongues he knows about a lot about  cleaning up things what happens because i usually end up cleaning the crew comes in and they're  sissies they don't just dig in and get it done damn it and so i end up cleaning the theaters also  because um i do a good job whether it's make the mess or clean it up i do a good job i hope i  hope you destroy the stress factory this weekend just i'm supposed to avoid stress and i'm working 
[02:19:00]  at the stress factor yeah exactly really that's how long would you have a heart attack i had it in  in the year 2000 when i was suing my brother because he wouldn't stop what i said he could  do to begin with and decided to hook up with a bunch of um of uh cheaters that was advertising  him as the real gallagher and saying i was in drug rehab and i wasn't well he looked just like you  too that was no he didn't but i meet a guy in my audience every night that looks more like me than  my brother i don't you know we had the same parents that's why he had a resemblance so he was going 
[02:19:30]  out as you and but i told him to because i was trying to stop carrot top from doing a smashing  act in the clubs because i was afraid that he was going to start that you know uh because he was  copying me in every other way striped shirt a microphone around his neck a box full of props  you were doing it and you were doing theater so you wanted to make sure in the club atmosphere that  i've got so many jokes why couldn't more people enjoy my comedy all my brother had to do was say 
[02:20:00]  my jokes and they get a laugh so why did it go so bad the way what would a chair look like  what makes teflon stick to the pan why does net zero cost 995 why what yeah exactly what happened  what went wrong with your brother he got with some promoters that decided that the 12 ticket was  given away the fact that it wasn't me and if they charged 22 then people would assume it was me  then they played the music before the show loud so people couldn't talk and tell each other that it  wasn't me and then they had the credit cards uh in the lobby and had the people sign their credit 
[02:20:30]  card before they went in so they felt as though there was no way they could get their money back  and that's not what i've done all my life i've been a friend of my fans and give them up  the real thing uh i give a long show if you'll sit there i'll do three hours your brother had to  sue him why he just didn't want to stop he got yeah money well he's just another stupid human all he had  to do was listen to me instead it cost me two hundred thousand dollars i could have put all 
[02:21:00]  three of his kids through college instead he decides to be an idiot and now his kids are stupid  and he doesn't have a job you made a lot of sense and your family sided with him why the family side  with him and not you that's where he got the stupidity the question is how did a smart guy come  from two stupid people do you ever notice this real tall guy and he has two short parents well  that's what happened somehow i don't know so you don't talk to your parents or your brother  no but i have millions and millions of fans and so i'd much rather have people who love me than 
[02:21:30]  have to put up with people that just i'm related to i mean that i don't care right you don't miss  your family no i dealt with them for years and years don't uh you know i'm done you know if you don't  uh if you don't act right i don't need to hang around you the music is playing which means  that's going to cut us off but uh one of my favorite bookings oh my god please come back  soon long time please come back soon are you going to be in new york for a while no 
[02:22:00]  if i was if i was doing a show i just did one at grammar see and like 25 people showed up  they don't care about me it's all koreans and uh  you're going to sell out at the stress factor yeah i'm telling you i'm going to sell the shows out  yeah stress factory new brunswick new jersey uh vinnie's really lucky to have you i'm telling  you right now he's losing the phone should i knock the phone off the wall who needs a pay  phone now anyway everybody's got a cell phone and now i'm thinking we don't need public libraries  now i'm thinking we need to get them on the internet i'm thinking we need to get them on
