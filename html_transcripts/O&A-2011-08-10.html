<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show began with a humorous introduction by Larry King, setting a lighthearted tone.  Opie, Anthony, and Jim Norton then launched into a discussion about Frances Bean Cobain's fashion career and the perceived lack of talent among the children of famous musicians.  This led to a lengthy segment playing and critiquing music from James McCartney, Sean Lennon, Simon Collins, and Jesse McCartney (incorrectly identified as Paul McCartney's son), among others.  They also touched upon the offspring of Ozzy Osbourne, Billy Joel, and Steven Tyler, peppering their commentary with colorful language and unverified rumors contributed by callers, including incorrect assertions about Amy Lee of Evanescence and Sting's daughter.  The segment also featured a discussion about the unusually large size of Robert Earl Hughes.

The show transitioned into a discussion about radio station IDs and fabricated guest lists, segueing into an announcement of upcoming guests: Bill Burr (with a "big announcement") and Joe DeRosa.  They briefly commented on Al Sharpton's disappointing Twitter feed before diving into a conversation about recent racial tensions, specifically flash mobs and related conspiracy theories, including one alleging Governor Scott Walker's involvement in a Wisconsin State Fair incident.  A soundbite of a Black man expressing this theory was played, followed by Philadelphia's mayor's strongly worded speech addressing the behavior of young Black men. A Black Republican caller, "John," joined the discussion, agreeing with the mayor but highlighting the need for improved media portrayals of Black people. This spurred a conversation about the American education system, societal problems within the Black community, and the lack of reinvestment by successful Black individuals.  Economic issues and the outsourcing of American jobs to China were also touched upon.  Bill Burr then called in, revealing his "big announcement" to be a Carnegie Hall performance with Paul Verzi and Joe DeRosa.  The conversation shifted to Burr's role in *Breaking Bad*, his New Mexico observations, and the potential for future riots.  The segment concluded with lighthearted banter between the hosts and Joe DeRosa about DeRosa's limited New York City knowledge.


Bill Burr and Joe DeRosa were both in studio for a significant portion of the show. The discussion, while informal and comedic, frequently veered into unexpected tangents.  Topics included Burr's Carnegie Hall performance (tickets on sale August 15th), gun ownership, a vulgar and extended discussion about the imagined smell of an Amish woman's genitals, speculation about the age of a young woman seen in the studio hallway, and a news story about an older man marrying a 16-year-old girl with parental consent.  The conversation also involved a song about a cat's genitalia, a clip of Al Sharpton, and comments about a 14-year-old performer on America's Got Talent.  The hosts frequently joked about the legal and societal implications of the topics discussed.

The show included a listener request to play a clip of Earl Weaver's profanity-laced argument with an umpire, followed by a video of a baseball player calling an umpire a "cunt."  This led to a discussion of "My Strange Addiction," featuring anecdotes about women who ate rocks and cremated ashes.  The conversation then shifted to a debate about vanilla versus peanut butter, including tangents on the invention of peanut butter and personal food preferences.  A running bit about producer Sam needing a raise dominated a significant portion of the show, detailing his increased responsibilities and lack of pay increase, alongside discussions about negotiations with station management for additional show hours and compensation. The hosts meticulously planned their discreet exit from the studio to avoid certain management personnel.  They also discussed a fan-made video about Anthony Weiner's scandal. The segment ended with DeRosa attempting to pick up a woman outside the studio window.


The final segment featured a prank involving "Harmonica" from "Special Delivery," and Joe DeRosa.  Opie, Anthony, and a character named Roland orchestrated a chaotic scenario pretending to be on and off the air, attempting to set up a date between Harmonica and Joe.  The prank involved numerous on-air arguments, explicit language, sexual innuendo, and escalating chaos, including Joe's frustration, equipment damage, and the hosts' apologies to engineers. The segment concluded with a transition to a commercial break and a brief preview of Ron and Fez.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  Hi, this is Larry King welcoming you to the Opie and Anthony show right here on Sirius XM Satellite Radio.  What the hell am I doing here?  Isn't it brilliant?  Forget it. The thing's out of control. Out of control.  Great guests, interesting interviews, and of course, your phone calls as well.  It gets my nipples hard, you know what I mean, son?  Are you out of your mind?  It's not the most talked about, not the most written about, and certainly not the most listened to show in the history of radio, but I'm still proud to intro it.  Oh, you're going to have a ball. 
[00:00:30]  Yeah, you're good.  America's most trusted name in news, the Opie and Anthony radio show.  Let's welcome our hosts, Opie and Anthony.  By the way, who's Jim Norton?  Good morning.  Hi.  How's everybody doing?  Good, I hope, out there.  We're a little late today because we're looking at pictures of Frances Bean, Cobain.  Yeah, was she, 18? 
[00:01:00]  She's 18 and she did a photo shoot.  These pictures are making the rounds.  That time flew by pretty quick.  She kind of looks like a boy.  Really?  Yeah, I think so.  I'm not feeling that as much.  I think she looks a lot like Courtney.  Really?  I think she looks a lot like Kurt.  Kurt in there.  There's a combination.  Where are these pictures, Travis, for the people out there that want to play along?  I think they're floating around everywhere, but this is a weird website.  Hey. 
[00:01:30]  H-E-D-I-S-L-I.  You know what?  We'll throw it up on our Facebook.  Okay.  That's a good idea.  What does she do?  I think she's into fashion.  She had two very talented parents, whether you loved Courtney Love or not, she was pretty  successful, and obviously Kurt Cobain.  And she's in fashion?  I think so.  I think she wants to get into fashion.  God, that's got to suck when you're like a rock star's daughter or son and you don't  have the talent.  Yeah.  That happened to Billy Joel's kid.  Did she try?  I don't know. 
[00:02:00]  You would assume they put a guitar in her hand at some point to see if she had the gift.  I've never heard of her trying to get into music.  Really?  Yeah.  Well, because Courtney Love was just a horrible parent to the point where Francis Bean doesn't  even talk to her unless they've patched that up since.  But, I mean, people talk about Billy Joel's daughter.  Yeah.  She's just okay.  Oh, she does art.  Who?  Francis Bean?  Yes.  Oh, boy.  Yeah.  Living off the royalties.  I mean, Mick Jagger and Keith Richards, they have some kids. 
[00:02:30]  None of them are doing well in music.  Is it Paul?  She does Kurt's art.  Huh?  She does Kurt Cobain's art.  Oh, shit.  What do you mean?  What was that?  That looks just like something like Kurt used to do.  Yeah.  Something he would have drawn.  Yeah.  Hang on.  Wow.  Yeah.  Doesn't Paul McCartney have a kid that's doing pretty well?  Stella.  Yeah.  No, no.  And music.  Stella!  All that fashion shit.  Anyone can do fashion.  I truly believe. 
[00:03:00]  If you have the means, meaning like the money and the connections.  The wherewithal?  Yes.  You need some wherewithal.  But I mean, you can't just throw your kid in the music industry and have him accept it.  I think you could do that with the fashion world.  I really do.  Just throw him in there.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Make a dress.  But doesn't Paul McCartney have a son that is in music?  Somebody help me out.  Your son.  A son?  Really?  Yeah.  Because I think he's the only one, really, of all the massive rock stars that had a kid  that's doing okay.  Well, are you sure you're not thinking of John Lennon? 
[00:03:30]  I've never heard of Paul McCartney's son.  Not John Lennon.  Sean Lennon's another one, though.  Yeah.  Although, Sean Lennon is very talented, but then he had to listen to his stupid mom.  Did Paul McCartney ever have a son?  I don't think he had a son.  Who am I thinking of?  Who am I thinking?  I know he's got like a daughter or two, maybe.  Yeah, I know he's...  Jacob Dillon was kind of a...  Yeah, he did have a son.  What happened to him?  He had a son, man.  I think...  I love the face of the earth.  Is it his son in music? 
[00:04:00]  Anyone?  I don't know.  Fuck.  Wow.  No?  You ever see Sean Lennon?  James Lewis McCartney.  Okay.  Born in 1977.  Okay.  He's the only son of songwriter Beatle.  All right.  What does he look like?  Paul McCartney.  What does he look like?  I don't know.  Okay.  You're correct.  He is in music.  Okay.  Let's see.  Is that him?  I believe he does okay for himself.  His new EP was produced by Paul McCartney.  Okay. 
[00:04:30]  I'm on to something.  Half his head in the picture, and it doesn't look like he's got one of those mop tops like  his dad had.  It looks like...  Uh-oh.  That baldness skips a generation.  What happened?  It looks like he needs some follicles.  Oh, boy.  Oh, boy.  He's got the Phil Collins...  He's Phil Collins' son.  He might be.  I think Phil Collins got in there.  His hair's a bit wispy.  Wow.  Wow.  It really is.  He looks like Corky from Life Goes On.  He looks like the Cusp character.  He does have that Paul McCartney look. 
[00:05:00]  That's for sure.  See?  How do you not know this?  Yeah, he's got a little Paul in the face right there.  I don't know.  All right.  Well, do we have any music from him that we can listen to and hear?  Sex Bagel?  Nothing?  I bet it sounds exactly like Paul McCartney.  But I hear he really tries to downplay the whole Paul's My Dad thing.  Well, he certainly has.  We didn't even know he existed.  But I think one of these songs actually did okay.  Really?  Yes.  And I go back to my original question.  Did you ever see Sean Lennon in concert?  No.  The guy is really fucking talented. 
[00:05:30]  And I've talked about this on the air before.  But he wails and does weird shit like his mom.  I'll see.  Don't need that.  Oh, did James McCartney shave his head?  Oh, boy.  Really?  That was two years ago.  Oh.  What happened to the lovable mop?  Like, his father still has the exact head of hair he had in the Beatles.  Well, the father might have done a thing or two, I would imagine.  Come on.  At this point.  Over the years, you never noticed him even getting a little wispy. 
[00:06:00]  Right.  We have music, though?  Yeah.  Eric's got one song.  All right.  I got one song.  What's it called?  Are we playing it here on Sirius XM Saturday Radio?  I'm guessing somebody is.  It's called Old Man.  Let's guess what channel plays this after we hear it.  And I'm not going to let the Sean Lennon thing go, by the way.  What do you think?  Because I'm obsessed with the fact that we could have had a great artist, but his father  died, so he wasn't able to influence his son anymore.  Yeah.  So he listened to his mama way too much. 
[00:06:30]  Well, Julian had some hits or one hit, right?  Didn't he?  Much Too...  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Floor Goodbye.  That one.  That one.  I remember that one.  But I think you would have to put him in the one hit wonder category.  The song Eric's going to play is a cover of Neil Young's song, Old Man.  What?  He has originals.  No.  Not in the let.  Isn't there anything on a website or Twitter?  I think we can, if you want to pop up, the computer.  Oh, there is Close at Hand is his song. 
[00:07:00]  I want to hear his song.  Okay.  And then we can do the cover.  All right.  Let's hear it.  I think we can do covers.  I do covers.  All right.  Whatever I've said is in my head, and all it seems to do is everything. 
[00:07:30]  Searching my mind for the ultimate fire.  Walking about the holiday, I'm doing so, yeah.  Want to play Match Game, Travis?  I think you're the only one that can do this.  All right.  What does it sound like?  Don't give your answer yet.  All right.  All right.  I'll be wrong, but I'll be wrong, so pick up the rest.  Well, it doesn't sound like Paul. 
[00:08:00]  A little musically, you hear something.  What happened to that whole, that old saying, the apple doesn't fall too far from the fucking  tree?  This apple fell all the way down into the valley.  This one, the tree must have been on a hill.  Oh, my God.  What does it sound like? 
[00:08:30]  I was thinking it sounds a little bit between a mix of bad Snow Patrol and bad Coldplay.  Oh, fuck.  Why would you?  No match today.  No match.  I went with Tom York.  All right.  A little Radiohead influence.  Yeah, a little bit.  Oh.  Hmm.  I heard a little Tom York in there.  A little more recent Tom York?  Sure.  A little bit.  A little bit.  All right.  No match today.  Wow.  What do you think of that, Ant?  I think it sucked.  If you want me to be completely honest, yeah.  So has there ever been a rock star kid that did well? 
[00:09:00]  That really did well?  People are yelling, John Bottom, son.  Get the fuck out of here.  Jason Bottom, right?  Ringo's son, John.  No.  Sting has a son?  Bob Dylan's son.  He was successful.  Jacob?  Yeah.  The Wallflowers had some huge hits.  Wallflowers.  Yeah, he did all right for a while, right?  Yeah.  Is he the biggest rock star kid to make it?  Rock star kid.  Wow.  We just invented a nice little segment here, Ant.  Where's the rock star kids? 
[00:09:30]  Who else do we got?  Frances Bean.  No, but she's not fucking doing anything.  Billy Joel.  Oh, Miley Cyrus.  Get the fuck out of here.  She made some money.  Eric in Cape Cod.  We're talking rock.  We're talking, did Steven Tyler have a kid that went into music or Sting's a good one  or Mick or maybe someone from the Bay City Rollers.  Did they have a kid?  Let's look at like the big, what about some of the big bands? 
[00:10:00]  Sean Lennon.  The big ones.  Julian Lennon.  Anyone from the who?  Anyone from the Stones?  Anyone from Starland Vocal Band?  How about Abba?  Does Abba got any kids?  Fuck.  We just want one name and then we can move on.  Let me say hi to Bob in Massachusetts.  Bob. 
[00:10:30]  Hey, guys.  Hey, Bob.  Hey, babe.  I think it's Jesse McCartney, his nephew.  Oh, his nephew is the one I'm talking about.  I believe that's who you're talking about.  And the only reason I know that is because I got two teenage girls.  So how is Paul related to Jesse McCartney?  I know you said nephew, but who's kid?  Like Paul's sister's kid or did Paul McCartney have a brother?  They are in no way related and Jesse has said that they are not related many times. 
[00:11:00]  Come on.  They're not even related.  Doesn't he have a song on the radio, though?  Jesse McCartney?  Yeah, I've heard of Jesse McCartney.  That's who I think I was thinking of, which means this whole bit means nothing.  Is he a teen heartthrob?  He certainly is.  He's a teen heartthrob.  Oh, that's funny, man.  All right.  Sorry, Bob.  Jim Morrison.  Jim Morrison's kid is in Candlebox.  Get the fuck out of here.  Sean in Pittsburgh.  Sean.  Hello.  Hello.  Jim Morrison, they said it was doing its son. 
[00:11:30]  That song, Far Away, is actually about a song he wrote about his dad.  I love this urban myth.  We've talked to Candlebox over the years.  Yeah.  I remember that song, Far Away.  If you could give us a little taste there, you rock.  Far Behind.  Right, right, right.  And this song, right, sir?  Yeah.  Yes, sir.  This is about what?  Jim Morrison being his father?  He was being a father.  That's what his father is. 
[00:12:00]  He was a teen father.  Who told you this?  I fucking couldn't see it.  Maybe it's an urgent myth or something.  You know what, man?  I love conspiracies.  Fuck the moon thing.  This is the greatest conspiracy ever.  This song is about the fact that he's Jim Morrison's illegitimate child.  This makes no sense.  The best way to tell if something is even remotely true is whether there's one Google result for it. 
[00:12:30]  And there are none.  None Google results.  None Google results.  This guy just made something up in his head.  Sean, I love you, brother.  You rule.  Go Penguins.  I'm going to give you a go Penguins for that.  Go Steelers.  Fuck the Steelers.  I'm a Jets fan.  I don't know if the Steelers, baby.  Steelers all the way.  No, I don't think so.  I don't think so.  Let's say hi to Don in Buffalo.  Don?  Yeah.  Hey.  Hey, boy.  What's up?  Yeah, Sting.  He has a son.  I don't know the guy's name. 
[00:13:00]  Exactly.  Exactly.  Well, look up the band, Fiction Plane.  They're actually pretty popular right now.  Wait, what's the name of the band?  Fiction Plane.  Fiction Plane?  Yeah, Roland's telling me that they were opening for Sting for a while.  Okay.  Wow.  And Sting's son, what does he do for the band?  He's the lead singer.  Oh, fuck.  Okay.  Guitar tech.  Here we are again, and I'll watch you end. 
[00:13:30]  Holy shit.  I wish that I could be more of a friend.  But I've got to go away.  I won't be back for 20 days.  And the way that things are going, oh, you won't be here when I return.  Can I just stay another day and live?  Live the dream out on the left side of your brain. 
[00:14:00]  I will bet Anthony hates this.  Nah, I don't hate it.  I was going to say it's generically good.  Yeah.  His voice is pretty cool.  Yeah.  Sort of a more rugged Sting.  Right.  Yeah.  Yeah, yeah, Sting.  Nah.  Nah.  Nah.  You're the only one who stays close to an end.  Oh, I'd like to spend a month at sea.  I'd like you just outside playing me. 
[00:14:30]  Sting Cornell.  That's good.  All right, enough of that.  Never heard of the fucking thing.  Yeah, never heard of him.  Fiction playing, though?  I might check that shit out.  You know what?  That right there wasn't bad enough where he couldn't parlay.  I'd like to say that because he's Sting's son.  That's amazing.  Like, that isn't all over the place.  Right.  How long have they been around?  The big song they had out was called Two Sisters, and it got played a lot on the rock  station. 
[00:15:00]  Really?  Didn't it?  Yeah.  Oh, my God.  Are we getting too old to know this shit, Ant?  Oh, my goodness.  Give me two sisters, Iraq.  I'm looking.  Hang on.  Yeah.  Let's see.  We got Wilson Phillips.  Get the fuck out of here.  Not in here.  Doesn't make the cut.  No?  What about Ricky Nelson's kid?  Who, Nelson?  Yeah.  The Nelson boys.  Oh, I don't know about that.  Van Halen's kid is, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Wolfgang can play the fucking guitar.  All right.  Fair enough.  Do you think he's the biggest?  That's what we're trying to come up with right now.  He might be. 
[00:15:30]  It's kind of depressing, because you got all these guys.  They all had kids.  And it's just pieces of shit.  And they just fucking think of their father's talent.  Failures.  You got two sisters.  No, it's not in Dillette, and profit's going too slow.  I'm not seeing it in there.  Ah.  All right.  Anyone else we want to add to the list?  Hmm.  Yes, we all know Eric Klotten had a son.  Jesus Christ.  Oh, oh, jeez.  Oh, please.  It's just too early for that type of thing.  That's not funny.  I don't think you can ever goof on that. 
[00:16:00]  Oh, boy.  No, no, no.  Shut up.  If I see Kelly Osbourne's fucking name on this, you're getting fucking bounced.  No, that's...  You didn't like her song?  That's a joke.  No, that's called...  My parents have a lot of fucking money, so they're going to get me a hit song.  Anyone can have a hit song if you have the money to pay for it.  Well, it was a cover, too, right?  It was Papa Don't Preach.  Oh, right.  Yeah.  Oh, well.  Oh, Mickey, you're so fine.  You're so fine.  You blow my mind.  Hey, Mickey.  No?  Shit. 
[00:16:30]  The most processed vocal you'll ever hear.  Oh, no.  Kim Kardashian beats this.  Well, that's a girl, yeah.  By a smidge.  Was this auto-tuned?  I can't remember.  I can't remember.  I know you're going to be upset  Cause I was always a little girl  But you should know by now  I'm not a baby  You can always talk me right from wrong 
[00:17:00]  Fuck, this is awful.  Just turn this off.  This is just awful.  If they put Ozzy's voice into that  Yeah.  I mean, with all the effects, people would be like,  Ozzy's done.  Yeah, yeah.  You can't do that.  That's not talent.  Stop.  That's silly.  Moon Unit.  Very good, Rodney.  Oh, Dweezil.  Moon Unit.  And Dweezil.  Let's not forget them.  The Zappers.  Yeah.  Chaz Bono Ant.  Wow.  No. 
[00:17:30]  I don't think she did anything musical.  Oh, wait.  She did try to do something musically.  Did she?  Yeah, man.  Right when she started plumping up.  Just before she started plumping up,  they tried to make her a sexy music girl.  Well, Dweezil was on MTV for a week.  True.  Nancy Sinatra.  Ah, these boots are made for walking.  Is there another Van Halen kid?  Cause this guy will not stop calling.  Frank Sinatra Jr.  Right.  I guess that's it. 
[00:18:00]  There's really no...  And then this guy writes,  Eddie Money's daughter's tits.  Can you Google that?  Let's Google that.  Yeah, we did kind of...  Let's Google this.  Enjoy that.  God damn.  Yeah, you know, you gotta...  That's...  Uh...  Uh...  Uh...  Uh...  Uh... 
[00:18:30]  Uh...  Uh...  Uh...  Yeah, look at the side of those.  Oh, I forgot about her.  Remember that picture?  Oh, yeah, I remember that picture.  Holy shit.  Oh, yeah, I remember that picture.  Wow.  Ample.  Those are two tits to paradise.  They sure are.  Why hasn't he been back on the show?  Uh...  Maybe because we talked about his daughter's tits ad nauseum.  Who cares, man?  I know.  Let's go to John.  Hi, John.  Hey.  Oh, Ziggy Marley.  Of course, John Field in Wilmington, North Carolina. 
[00:19:00]  Oh.  That's a biggie.  Ziggy Marley's a biggie.  Uh...  Go ahead, John.  Hello.  John?  Yellow.  Yellow, come in.  Come in.  Uh, you.  You want to talk about Phil Collins' son?  Talk to me, Johnny.  Talk to me, Johnny.  Yeah.  Yeah, Simon Collins.  Joe Collins' son.  Got three albums out.  Simon Collins?  Is it Phil?  Simon Collins sounds just like his father.  Phil.  All right.  Phil.  Phil.  Phil Connors. 
[00:19:30]  Simon.  Simon Collins.  Nothing.  I sure as heck fire never heard of you.  All right.  We got Simon Collins.  Let's hear some Simon Collins.  This is Unconditional.  Wow, man.  We can't find one that has a legitimate hit nowadays.  No.  There were a few in the past, obviously.  Yeah.  This is Simon Collins.  Your love.  Your love.  It's unconditional. 
[00:20:00]  You know, there's a lot of Genesis fans out there.  Yeah.  Just fucking grab this guy.  I know.  Go retire, old man.  Let's hear another one.  You got a few over there, huh?  He could so pull off playing Genesis songs.  He could just do it.  Or singing them.  Yeah.  Phil Collins cover band.  You know how they say, before you do that, you know how they say that, like, hair loss 
[00:20:30]  skips a generation?  Yeah.  I need to see a picture of Simon Collins.  This guy should have a full head of fucking hair.  Hang on.  I just saw a picture.  Let's see.  Oh, boy.  He's doing the weird emo comb over.  He's doing the weird emo, so it goes down to his eyes, and it looks a little wispy in front.  But, oh, wait a minute.  Wait, wait.  Go with that one.  Go with that one.  All right.  Oh, yeah.  There's a problem there.  Now, see, I'm doing that, too. 
[00:21:00]  Now, see, I know what that's about.  There's a problem there.  You keep it long on top.  You comb it forward slightly, and then move it to the side.  If he went back with all that, you'd see a Phil Collins widow's peak sticking up.  So, shut up with that stupid hair loss skips a generation.  Oh, wait.  That's him?  Yeah.  Is that him?  Oh, okay.  That's 40.  Oh, Jesus.  Is that really him?  He's got the Phil Collins circa 1980.  Yeah, yeah. 
[00:21:30]  He's there.  He's got the exact island thing happening.  Wow.  Oh, wow.  He's got the exact same hair.  He's just younger, so he has some of it left.  All right.  Let's get back to that song.  Yeah.  Let's get another.  I can feel it.  Oh, sorry.  Yeah.  Let's get some Phil Collins vocals in here.  I hear where the streets have no name. 
[00:22:00]  I can't take it on my own.  I can't make it all alone.  I'm powerless.  Yeah, I confess.  I lose myself and my excess.  I'm powerless.  I'm powerless.  Talentless.  I'm talentless.  I'm talentless.  Now I remember all I've done. 
[00:22:30]  Now I know why I was numb.  I'm looking for a rock song, but I guess not, huh?  Does he rock?  Yeah, do we?  What is the big song in Dillette?  Oh, the big song in Dillette, Eric?  From Simon?  Nothing.  Oh, see?  Oh, another Dillette.  I guess this isn't one of the big...  I'm on his MySpace page.  That's where we're playing all these songs, and I just love looking at...  It's a MySpace page?  Yeah.  Remember MySpace? 
[00:23:00]  Oh, boy.  2007, 2006.  Oh, boy.  So as the people play...  People don't go back for more.  No, they're not going back for more.  That's not a good sign.  You want to try one more?  Yeah, let's try.  Just the beginning.  Yeah, because it's Phil Collins' kid.  I want to hear something that maybe rocks a little.  This ain't it.  He's digging on that weird, eclectic kind of synth thing. 
[00:23:30]  Ha-ha!  Mama.  Mama, right?  I think so, man.  Mama!  You could trick people and say these were outtakes from a Phil Collins' album. 
[00:24:00]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  He's not as good as Phil Collins, vocally.  Like, it doesn't have that...  Like, it doesn't have that...  Like, enough...  ...balls to it or something.  I don't know.  Oh, okay, man.  That sounds a lot like it.  You're dying on your creed.  Darkest in the shit you spent.  Still a fear of threat.  That's fucking Phil Collins, yeah. 
[00:24:30]  He made the mistake of not updating the sound.  You know what I mean?  Oh, yeah, yeah.  He should have...  Just get rid of all those synthesizers and all that shit.  Like, what is he gonna...  Because people are gonna compare you to your father at that point.  Yeah.  And does Phil Collins put music out at all?  He's depressed.  Because he'd be like...  Phil Collins is hurting.  Hey, he's stepping on my toes, kid.  No, Phil's hurting.  Is he hurting?  Remember when we met him and he was kind of a cunt?  He was miserable.  He was miserable.  It turns out he's hurting. 
[00:25:00]  He's sad.  Oh, is that it?  Yeah, he's...  I think there was a story that came out recently.  He was thinking about killing himself or something.  Really?  If someone could find that, that would be great.  Yikes.  I'm not sure.  I thought I heard something like that.  You want another rumor?  Yes.  I like the Candlebox rumor.  Get ready to Google, Travis.  That's a good guy.  Get ready to Google.  That was a good one.  Jim, go ahead.  Okay.  Getty Lee's daughter, that singer from Abravestence.  I don't know if it's true or not. 
[00:25:30]  Getty Lee's daughter.  The soccer bandy impersonator.  Right.  Is the singer of Evanescence.  Well, can we hear...  Of Evanescence.  Can we hear the big song, Iraq?  Evanescence.  Yeah.  That was the Apple...  Evanescence.  It was Bring Me to Life.  Yeah.  They just released a new single, actually.  Guys, you're about to hear Getty Lee's daughter.  Yes.  I don't know.  He goes, I don't know.  I don't know.  Who is it?  Amy Lee?  Yeah.  Well...  You know when they got the same last thing. 
[00:26:00]  Getty Lee, Amy Lee.  Two vocalists, eh?  Because some guy's got to go, you know, man.  Getty Lee's daughter, everyone.  Enjoy.  Yeah.  Looking nothing like Getty Lee.  She's got a great voice, though.  She looks...  Does she look good, or is that just kind of a good picture?  She looks good.  She's an attractive lady.  I never understood the rap shit in this song.  Oh, yeah, yeah. 
[00:26:30]  Like, they didn't need it.  No.  I mean, it was a huge hit, so what am I talking about, but...  Maybe that's why he left the band.  Yeah.  Wow, Getty must be proud.  Yeah, Suze. 
[00:27:00]  Fuck.  You like that song, Ant?  Yeah, I do kind of like that one.  I know.  People will call you...  They were good.  People will call you a faggot for liking that, but what are you going to do?  I'll call you a faggot for a lot of other things.  That shit is good, man.  Yeah.  Gavin Rosdale's daughter, she's new to Playboy.  That's right.  What?  From his first...  Yeah, before Gwen.  Really?  Yeah.  What does she look like?  The bush guy. 
[00:27:30]  You know the bush guy when we met him had a fucking daughter?  No.  She's old, man.  How old?  Well, at least 18.  At least, yeah.  She's in Playboy.  Uh, Daisy Lowe.  Daisy Lowe?  Oh, that sounds like a poor one name.  And I got breaking news, man.  Yeah?  Oh, yeah.  Sting has a daughter, too.  Oh, no.  Yeah, we'll get to that in a second.  Oh, no.  Oh, wow.  Do you have the nude photo?  Oh, I see tits.  Oh, I see tits.  Yep.  Let's see. 
[00:28:00]  Oh, wow.  Something going on with the boobies.  If you have to put your hands over your head like that, something's going on.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  If all the arms are up...  Look at it.  She's making believe she has to adjust her sunglasses.  Yeah, yeah.  But you know what she's really doing there.  And then the other ones, she's naked underwater, so gravity isn't a factor.  Something's going on with her tits, people.  Look, I've got to adjust my sunglasses.  Yeah.  Which just happens to move my boobs upwards.  Yeah.  Well, let's see the ass shot. 
[00:28:30]  Oh, yeah.  Okay.  Take a dip.  Sure.  Oh, my goodness.  There it is again.  Arms overhead.  Never good.  Yeah.  She's got a couple of saggers.  There she is underwater.  Nice.  What do you give her?  Oh, okay.  Well, you know, she's...  That's all right.  You'd fuck the shit out of that if you were young.  Yeah, of course.  Let's say hi to Deke in New York. 
[00:29:00]  Hey, Deke.  Hey, Deke.  Yeah, her name is I Blame Coco, and she's got a song on BPM right now.  I Blame Coco.  Yeah, Sting's Daughter.  That's her name?  Sting's Daughter.  Yep.  All right, can we look up Sting's Daughter?  Also, we're getting info, Ant.  Yes.  Sting's Daughter was the bumblebee in the Blind Melon video.  That's absolutely not true.  We're learning some shit today.  Amy Lee, the chick from Evasence. 
[00:29:30]  Yeah, yeah.  She was...  Getty Lee's Daughter.  Getty Lee's Daughter.  The song Far Behind by Candlebox is about Jim Morrison's illegitimate child that's in  the band.  That's in the band, of course.  And now we're learning that the B-girl from Blind Melon is Sting's Daughter.  Is Sting's Daughter.  I love our listeners.  We get to learn good stuff.  Yeah.  Do we have any music from Sting's Daughter?  Still looking.  Her name is really, I Blame Coco?  Yeah, it's also the name of the band, but it's my wife's a big Sting fan, so it kind 
[00:30:00]  of sounds like old police.  Really?  The original stuff?  Yeah.  I'd love to hear something.  We found something.  All right, we found something.  Hold on a line, brother.  Hold on a line.  This is for you.  This is called Self Machine.  Self...  Okay.  Okay.  Oh, man.  I need some amyl nitrate poppers and gay sex.  I saw the mirror staring back at me.  And they told me I'm a self machine.  I saw the mirror staring back at me. 
[00:30:30]  And they told me I'm a self machine.  It said I gave you these skulls.  And I gave you these wounds.  I told you the false.  And I showed you the truth.  I saw the mirror staring back at me.  And they told me I'm a self machine.  Lonely robot in a wasteland.  Busted in a lonely harbor.  I sure ain't feeling that. 
[00:31:00]  I like the voice.  I just don't like that type of music.  Simon Collins covered Keep It Dark by Genesis, if you want to hear it.  Yeah, I see that.  Oh, no.  Keep It Dark was off...  What album was that off?  It's been a while.  I don't know.  Whatever.  It doesn't matter, I guess.  Oh, by the way, Anthony.  By the way.  Randy Jackson from Zebra.  Yeah.  First cousin to the Jackson Five.  Thank you, Kevin, from Connecticut.  Never heard of that.  All right.  Let's hear Keep It Dark.  Thank you, sir, for the I blame Coco thing.  Yep. 
[00:31:30]  All right.  Hit it.  Yeah.  Now is he going to go...  Oh, Keep It Dark was off Abacab, I guess, right?  Is he going to try to make it sound like his dad, or is he going to go in his own direction?  Is he going to try to make it sound like his dad, or is he going to go in his own direction?  Oh, Jesus.  Okay, come on now.  You know, different arrangement, but boy, the vocals. 
[00:32:00]  Why wouldn't he do, like, a huge Genesis hit if he's going to do a cover?  Yeah.  Keep It Dark was an okay song.  Yeah.  It's not really a hit.  Not really. 
[00:32:30]  I don't think so.  Sounds very Phil Collins.  Yeah.  I think all of these people have gotten more airplay on this show just now.  Than they have in their entire fucking careers.  And we just made our point.  Yeah.  That rock...  Stars.  Icons.  Kids.  Stars.  Their kids suck.  For the most part.  I do want to talk about Elijah Blue for a second.  Riley, go ahead. 
[00:33:00]  Hey, lady, damon.  Hey, buddy.  What about Elijah Blue?  Cher's kid.  He's in that band, Deadsy.  Oh.  And, well, Elijah Blue is Greg Allman's son.  Yeah.  And Elijah Blue...  Something's going on with Cher's DNA because Elijah Blue, for a while, I don't know what  he's up to lately, liked to dress like a woman.  Yeah.  He had some of the gi in him.  And then...  Well, you shoot enough heroin, you'll put a dress on to it.  Good point.  Try that out. 
[00:33:30]  Good point.  I like that line.  Sounds amazing.  And then you got Chaz Bono, who's now a guy.  Yeah.  So what's going on?  Who's the common denominator here?  Yeah.  Cher fucking pops out weird kids.  Well, look at her.  She's fucked.  What does Elijah do for Deadsy?  Get that song, Carrying Over.  He plays guitar and sings.  Okay.  Is it good?  Do we know the song?  That song's pretty good.  The song, Carrying Over, he does.  That's pretty good.  Yeah. 
[00:34:00]  He's scary looking, man.  The Kina Graham.  This was a big song like 10 years ago.  It's terrible.  It was awful.  Oh, it is?  Sounds horrible already.  Does Elijah sing on this one?  No, I think it's just the guitarist.  But I'm not a big Deadsy fan, so I might be wrong.  It's a terrible video, though. 
[00:34:30]  Is the pendulum going to be swinging back the other way?  I feel it is.  He's singing, by the way.  That's Cher's kid.  What does this sound like?  Every fucking 80s trashy thing.  This came out around when Marilyn Manson was big. 
[00:35:00]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Okay.  Holy shit.  I had no idea until right this second.  Thank you, Adam Levine and Great Neck.  What happened?  Keith Richards had a very famous son.  Who?  Michael.  Oh, wow.  I didn't even know that.  The hair, though.  Huh?  The hair was very similar.  The hair's the dead giveaway.  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Huh.  Michael.  And now it's just getting ugly. 
[00:35:30]  Jay and Huntington ends the bit with this.  Roger Waters of Pink Floyd's family?  Yeah.  Used to own Muddy Waters' family.  Little known fact.  And it always has to end on a racist note, doesn't it?  Of course.  Yeah.  Wow.  I guess that's it.  Point proven.  Point proven.  Iron Maiden's daughter's coming in.  Pablo Dillon's coming in.  Anyone know any of these? 
[00:36:00]  Pablo Dillon?  Coldplay's son.  Coldplay's son?  What are you talking about?  Those guys are young.  Bobby in the Bronx.  Bobby.  No, no, man.  What do you got?  You got to Google it.  Dean Martin's son is the lead singer for Coldplay.  Oh, okay.  Freaking assholes.  Dean Martin's son.  Got it now.  Isn't Dean Martin's son dead, by the way?  I think he crashed in a fighter plane or something.  Matt.  Okay. 
[00:36:30]  Matt, anything?  Pablo Dillon.  I think it's Dillon's nephew.  Yeah.  Do we know Pablo Dillon, Travis?  Pablo Dillon.  I kind of like this bit because we're really just trying to find one.  Just one.  One that was successful after his...  Bob Dillon's grandson is Pablo Dillon, a 15-year-old rapper.  Oh, now I got to hear this.  Come on now.  All right.  Come on now.  But what Dillon was doing, I guess some people would say Dillon kind of did a little of that 
[00:37:00]  rap in some of his songs.  Oh, please.  That's just called lack of ability to sing.  Subterranean homesick blues.  Yeah.  All right.  Let's hear a little here.  Top of the world.  All right.  Sure.  Pablo Dillon.  Darnell Robinson.  K Major.  Oh, 10 Minutes.  I love when they say their names in the songs. 
[00:37:30]  Yeah.  Opie and Anthony.  Six to ten.  Then the shit hour.  I understand I really do come from scrutiny.  Immunity.  Because my people turned their back on me.  And laughed at me.  My back against the wall.  I couldn't fall.  Had to have it all.  This is my father.  Dillon's your grandfather.  Shut up.  Yeah, really, man.  Put your fake rage.  You think Bob Dillon's proud?  No, the crowd that he plugged that guitar in that day. 
[00:38:00]  He doesn't get that.  No.  I'm the grandson of a man.  Nothing less than legendary.  That's a lot of pressure.  So I'm Barry Gordy.  I am very Motown, bitch.  I'ma get that crown.  While I'm at it, I might reinvent Sam.  Oh, he had to bring up, you know, that he's a grandson.  Oh, God.  Now we got Sam bopping.  Fucking awful.  Oh, I, when they ride by.  All the people screaming at me.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  They spinning this over in Shady? 
[00:38:30]  Huh?  I'm gonna introduce it to him.  Yeah.  I don't even know if it's good.  I have no idea what makes a good rap song.  He sounds so angry.  He's Bob Dylan's grandson.  How fucking, how black is he?  That shit is the truth.  What happened to the Jewish part of him?  Yeah, the Jewy Jews in there.  That's no Beastie Boys Jewish rapping.  That's like fucking, that's like black rapping.  He's all bitter.  He's saying bitches.  I don't know.  He says his name in the beginning. 
[00:39:00]  Yeah, Pablo Dylan.  I'm gonna start the show by just saying that.  Yeah, Anthony Cumia.  Greg Hughes.  Yeah, in his ear.  We have to talk about our fathers, though.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I can't really come up with anything.  I kind of drew a blank, too.  Very, uh.  My dad had a lot of love in his heart, though.  Dad had a lot of alcohol in his liver. 
[00:39:30]  Just trying to fit that in.  All right.  I think we're done with this dumb bit.  It was a good exercise, though.  Pablo Dylan says that he considers his grandfather to be the Jay-Z of his time.  Just stop it.  Would you fucking stop it?  Hey, man.  I love Dylan.  He's right.  It goes Jay-Z, Bob Dylan.  Dylan was amazing.  How about Jay-Z as the Bob Dylan of his time?  You know what?  You're not a big Dylan fan, Amp?  Uh, no. 
[00:40:00]  Not really.  Even like the hits?  No.  Pablo Dylan?  Like Rolling Stone?  No.  Hmm.  I really just don't like Dylan.  I never liked him?  No.  Do you know that Tom Petty is brothers with Richard Petty?  The race car driver?  It's amazing.  I never even knew that.  We're learning a lot today.  Eric's telling me that Katy Perry is his daughter.  And Katy Perry is the daughter.  Holy shit, really?  Yeah. 
[00:40:30]  Wait, wouldn't that be Perry?  Let's change the law.  Yeah, that's why I'm making sure that you know that Eric said that.  Yeah, yeah.  Wouldn't you go with Joe Perry, you idiot?  Yeah, I have a Joe Perry.  From Aerosmith?  That's a biggie.  They sort of look alike, too, don't they?  Eric's generation now, he's not interested in that bullshit.  Ah, shit.  He's up to date.  Exactly.  And now because we talked about Elijah Blue, people want to hear Frankie Blue.  Frankie Blue, 10 grand prize winner. 
[00:41:00]  I've been hanging out because I was hoping to get one, but wow, I guess rock stars, kids  don't really.  Yeah.  Make it like they're famous.  Katy Perry, actually, and this is the truth, Steve Perry from Journey.  That's his.  Oh, okay.  Yeah.  Or it's either Refrigerator Perry.  It's a lot of controversy.  There's got to be some paternity tests that go on for that.  People are out of their minds.  Well, Howard Hughes was my grandfather. 
[00:41:30]  That is true.  Howard Hughes.  I just don't like talking about Jason.  That's pretty good.  Yep.  Was he the Jay-Z of his time?  He was like the Orville Wright of his time.  I guarantee I was fucking related to Howard Hughes.  Yeah?  All I had to do was watch that fucking movie to relate.  Not to the money part.  Do you sometimes just look around?  The blueprints.  Yeah, yeah.  Look at the blueprints.  Yeah, yeah.  Look at the blueprints.  A lot of people think I'm related to Robert Earl Hughes, and that is just not true. 
[00:42:00]  Robert Earl Hughes?  He was the fattest man in the world for a while.  Oh.  You want to look up Robert Earl Hughes?  Was he the guy that was buried in the piano case?  Yes.  They said a piano case, but it was a coffin the size of a piano case.  A lot of people think I am or whatever relates to this guy.  More urban legend, by the way, that he was buried in a piano case.  It was a coffin the size of a piano case.  Please.  Robert Earl Hughes.  Guy and Lillian Hughes aren't your typical garden variety retired couple. 
[00:42:30]  Their past is unique.  They've sown different seeds.  They were once a part of something really big.  What?  The biggest attraction in the world.  But it didn't make them rich.  What happened?  Now for extra money, Guy hops on a riding mower and cuts the grass at Cemetery.  Jesus.  Lillian keeps the poultry plump.  She ought to know a little bit about chicken feed.  What the fuck is this?  Guy and Lillian used to work in the unglamorous end of show business.  Yeah. 
[00:43:00]  Carnivals.  And it's hard work.  Don't let anybody tell you it's not.  That's not a leather strap.  It's a man's belt.  Oh, my God.  The carnival show was a family effort, but the big star was Guy's brother, Robert Earl.  He wore the pants in this showbiz family.  This is my brother's belt.  Robert Earl Hughes.  Fucking hillbillies.  How big is it?  120 inches long.  He's 110 inches tall. 
[00:43:30]  You would think they would redo this without the wind.  Without the wind.  With a wind screen on your mic.  That's 10 feet.  Guy's brother, Robert Earl Hughes, was 6 feet tall and 10 feet around.  He made Robert Earl the world's most prodigiously pounded human ever.  The world's baddest man.  What a piece of shit this guy was.  They said when he was 6 months old, he had hoof and cough and erupted the thyroid gland.  He had the hoof and cough and the thyroid.  And after he was 6 months old, he went to gaining. 
[00:44:00]  He kept gaining and he never stopped.  400, 500, 600 pounds and counting.  Word spread about Robert Earl's massive bulk.  It was hard to hide.  It was harder to believe.  Oh, my God.  So people from all over came to Fishhook to see him in person.  A lot of people always thought it would be bad because he'd gawking at him and things.  But Robert didn't think that.  No, he loved it.  Robert enjoyed coming.  Loved the attention.  And so he could have people to come and see him. 
[00:44:30]  Robert Earl was a natural wonder.  He began making appearances at stores in Hannibal and Pittsfield.  I see somebody in this room that can have a career maybe.  It doesn't work out.  Robert Earl is here to county fairs and carnivals as a sideshow attraction.  Most of the people were kind.  Some were not.  When we really went on the road, we built this van so people couldn't get to him  because there's lots of, I'd call him smart, Alex.  They was burning with a cigarette to see whether he was real or not. 
[00:45:00]  They burned him with a cigarette like he was a monster.  Yeah.  But to go along with his size, Robert Earl had an enormous and unbreakable spirit.  Oh, boy.  He had a huge capacity for giving and taking joy.  His emotions were not disproportionate.  He died at 22 years old.  Yeah.  I don't think I ever saw Robert when he was sad about anything.  He didn't have been 30.  He made 30.  It's always happening.  By the time he died in 1958 of kidney trouble, Robert Earl Hughes weighed half a ton. 
[00:45:30]  It was a Guinness World Record.  Naturally, his funeral was big.  They set up a tent.  1,500 people attended the services in Mount Sterling.  Making people smile was easy for Robert Earl.  It made him feel good to make others feel good.  And when you got down to it, he wasn't so different after all.  Really?  You can take all kinds of measurements of a man.  But in the life of Robert Earl Hughes, one statistic stands out. 
[00:46:00]  What?  Pound for pound, he may have been the happiest person.  Oh, right.  Wait.  What?  That was just all horse shit at the end.  That certainly was.  He made people feel good?  He didn't make people feel good.  He was a freak.  He was a freak.  A freak.  Those weren't smiles.  Those were people laughing at him.  Maybe people felt good that they weren't that fat.  He died at 32.  At 32.  He looked like he was 50.  So I'm not that guy.  Wow.  So that's, what, a great uncle? 
[00:46:30]  Who's on the phones today?  Danny.  Oh, it's obvious.  I'm going to go to Nicole because it says, hi, I live by a cemetery.  Thought I should call.  Listen to me.  Hi, Nicole.  How are you?  I'm doing great.  How are you?  So, what's up?  I'm telling you the fuckhead because I truthfully do live in Mount Sterling.  I live, like, probably eight miles from Benville Cemetery where Robert Hughes is buried. 
[00:47:00]  It's out in the middle of nowhere.  Have you ever been to his grave site?  Oh, you know, I do that regularly.  Why wouldn't I?  Yeah.  My husband's a truck driver, so I just don't have anything else to do.  So you called because you're eight miles away from something we just talked about.  Yeah.  You fuckheads.  You fuckheads.  Well, you do realize how silly that is. 
[00:47:30]  Probably so.  But you know what she did?  She found a reason to call.  Fair enough.  That's good.  Fair enough.  If you have any connection to anything we're talking about, please call.  Oh, just call.  That's what we look for on this show.  Yeah.  I'm eight miles away from where he's buried.  Have you ever seen the grave site?  Oh, she's gone.  Yeah.  And now we got Sonny Ferelli.  It just says, has a great call.  Oh.  Sonny. 
[00:48:00]  Yeah.  Did you know Mick Jagger and Steven Tyler are actually brothers separated at birth?  Um.  Oh, I'm really punching out this time.  Too late.  Can't punch out?  Crash.  Fucking thing is crash.  You're in a crater.  You're dead.  Please keep Danny on the phone.  He's smoldering.  All day.  He is.  All right.  Oh, my God.  It's a classic.  I live by a cemetery.  I decided to go.  It's going to make me laugh all fucking day. 
[00:48:30]  All right.  Well.  There you have it.  Yeah.  Point proven.  No talented kids from, uh, from rock stars.  Is Simon Collins still trying to make it though?  Or, I mean, does he have a Facebook page at least?  Well, I know he's got a MySpace.  I know that MySpace, though.  How's he been?  Until Justin Timberlake reinvents that shit.  Who's going to MySpace?  He couldn't update.  He was trying to fucking fix his hair.  Simon Collins has 1,200 friends. 
[00:49:00]  Nice.  Oh, my God.  1,200.  Nice.  Oh, help.  Help him out.  SimonCollins.net.  Oh, he couldn't even get .com, huh?  Oh, it says your business name here.  Oh, boy.  It's not even set up.  Oh, boy.  Oh, Jesus.  Hey, did another wrestler die?  What?  Restart clock?  What?  I have to look into it.  I have to do a little research to find out whether he's going to get  credited.  Oh, really?  Why?  What's the controversy? 
[00:49:30]  Because he wasn't like a giant name.  He was just like an indie guy.  Like, if he wasn't dead, nobody would know who he was.  Mm-hmm.  Outside of the, you know, really deep internet wrestling community.  I say it all hinges on what was the biggest thing he did.  Okay.  I mean, I would have to.  He wasn't.  Never WWE or F?  No, no, no.  TNT?  Mm-mm.  TNA?  I don't know if he did anything on TV.  Well, then it doesn't count.  Oh.  That's just some backyard wrestler guy.  Wow.  Jumping into barbed wire with his friend's camcorder. 
[00:50:00]  Just some guy who liked to wrestle.  Yeah.  He was on the independent scene.  How many days have we gone?  I don't know.  I'd have to look it up in my records.  We're trying to go 100 days without a wrestler dying.  I mean...  It's like an unsigned band.  That's what he is.  Yeah, I mean...  He's an unsigned band just sitting there playing fucking clubs.  Yeah, we don't have to stretch this bit.  No.  Okay.  Someone will die.  Yeah.  Don't worry.  We've been going two years, right?  Yes, and we haven't...  We've gone over two years without going 100 days without a wrestler dying that people know. 
[00:50:30]  Now, what if...  So we don't have to fucking, you know, reach for straws here.  But what if there were...  With an obscure guy.  WWE wrestlers who tweeted on Twitter about being upset about the death?  Oh.  Because then...  You know what, Ant?  That's close.  Because that means he made an impact on them.  Right.  I don't even know.  Was he on his way up?  It's real to him.  Still real to them.  Still real to them.  Damn it.  Man, fucking E-Rock has a lot of things to choose from going in a break. 
[00:51:00]  Oh, my God.  Did you get my Reverend Al Sharpton thing?  Was it good?  Yeah.  It was all right.  Reverend Al Sharpton had trouble reading the other night or last night.  Really?  Abertation?  I think he just doesn't know how to read.  He just mixes words all up.  That's probably true.  I was following...  You know what?  That's probably true.  I saw...  I forgot to bring this up.  Reverend Al is on the Twitter.  Oh, boy.  And I decided...  You know what?  I'm not annoyed enough following people like Michael Moore and everything else.  Jason Alexander. 
[00:51:30]  Yeah, yeah.  It's just...  It really...  It's infuriating.  Sure.  Yeah.  By the way, Michael Moore, Mandy Moore's father.  Wow.  Yeah, yeah.  I didn't know that.  Famous family.  Yeah, very famous.  It's pretty cool.  So, I checked him out.  All he does...  Because I'm hoping to hear some, like, profound fucking racial arguments that I could get in on and shit like that.  He just plugs every fucking TV appearance he's going to be on. 
[00:52:00]  That's 99% of it.  And the other 1% is where he's flying to do another fucking appearance.  That's all it is.  He doesn't talk about anything.  Every once in a while, I'll try to put some kind of...  Spin on something?  No, I'll try to put some inspirational bullshit up if something's happening.  But, look, I'm at MSNBC.  Catch me right now.  I'm going to be on Keeping It Real with Al Sharpton. 
[00:52:30]  Hey, headed to do Hour of Power, Al Sharpton.  Hey, tune in to Hour of Power.  This is all one right after the other.  I'm back in T.C. to preach, 8 to 11 o'clock at a Baptist church.  Back in New York, the House of Justice, to speak this Saturday.  Action rally.  I'm live in D.C. at 6 p.m.  Tune in, MSNBC.  Why is the media scared of Reverend Al Sharpton?  He just talked about how many fucking stations he's going to be on. 
[00:53:00]  This guy is fucking delusional.  Who the fuck's scared of him in the media?  No one's scared of Al.  Al.  Why is the media scared of Reverend Al Sharpton?  Reverend Al Sharpton, written by Reverend Al Sharpton.  Yeah, there's a guy that's a bit full of himself.  Hey, man.  Yeah.  Someone's bringing up Liv Tyler.  Yeah.  The point of this hour was that most of these very famous people don't really have talented siblings. 
[00:53:30]  Some of these people are so famous that they're able to push their kids into a career for a while.  That's what Aerosmith.  But where the fuck is Liv Tyler?  And that's what Aerosmith did.  They put her in the videos back in the 80s.  Very successful.  Her and what's her name there from Clueless?  Alicia.  Alicia.  Alicia.  Would you stop at Alicia?  It's Alicia.  And never mention herding puppies or anything around her.  Because she is quite the animal activist and vegan.  What an annoying bitch she comes off as. 
[00:54:00]  And they put them in the videos.  The videos were hugely popular.  And that launched an acting career for Liv.  Right.  Who did quite well.  She's a good actress and everything.  But where is she now?  If she had real talent, she'd still be doing it.  Yeah, but she was in like fucking Lord of the Rings and everything.  Oh, fuck.  I got shut the fuck up.  That's a big one.  I got shut the fuck up.  That's a big one.  She was in fucking, you know, another blockbuster fucking...  Empire Records?  Empire Records. 
[00:54:30]  Dude, you just shut me down with that.  Armageddon.  You just shut me down.  You're absolutely right.  Are we getting a huge movie?  Yeah.  I picked the wrong broad.  Yeah, she did well.  You're right.  You're right.  Fuck, I fucked that one up.  She did well.  That could be the biggest celebrity of a rock star.  But not based in music.  Yeah, we were looking for the music person.  Yeah, yeah.  We were looking for the talent from the parent, being music, going to the kid.  Sean Lennon should have been the one.  I'm telling you.  Pablo Dillon, I think, is in a lead so far. 
[00:55:00]  Just based on this conversation.  Oh.  Crazy.  And we're going to end with this, Ant.  This is huge.  Frank has some inside scoop here.  Oh, Frank was better?  Frank, go ahead, sir.  Hey, guys.  Hey, yeah.  Lady Gaga is Kajagoogoo's daughter.  Oh, she just spun it around a little bit.  Oh, I see.  That makes sense, though.  It certainly does.  Lady Gaga is Kajagoogoo.  Ah, you people.  Very good.  With that, we're going to go to break. 
[00:55:30]  Yes, we are.  What else?  Did you do the beep game with the rock lady?  Oh, yeah.  Oh.  Did it turn out pretty good?  Yeah.  Everyone's talking about the rock lady.  Everybody?  Everybody.  She's nibbling on rocks on that My Strange Addiction show.  Yeah.  Rocks or...  Kajagoogoo.  I just want to thank each and every one of y'all for all you've done to your bodies.  It's still real to me, damn it.  I mean...  Make it easy, man. 
[00:56:00]  Thank y'all, guys.  Y'all are awesome.  Thank you so much, Mr. Fuck, for saying what needed to be said.  I don't want to see another one of these.  Well, thanks.  This is Brian Cox.  Hey, this is Chaz Palmaturi.  Hey, this is Danny McBride.  Hey, this is David DeCompany.  Hey, this is Michael Madsen.  You're listening to O.B. and Anthony.  I don't know why, but...  I'm still trying to figure out what the hell this show is about. 
[00:56:30]  You get all the big stars.  That sounds impressive.  It really does, man.  All those big celebs.  But how do you know they said you're listening to O.B. and Anthony after that?  Well, you don't.  On regular radio, I never understood that.  That's just it.  You go, hi, I'm Ozzy.  Hi, I'm Obama.  Hi, I'm whatever.  And then the last guy goes, and you're listening to O.B. and Anthony.  Then it sounds like all those guys were on O.B. and Anthony.  Yeah.  I remember radio guys.  By the way, we played the Ronnie Spector thing, Take Me Home Tonight, because it's her birthday. 
[00:57:00]  Oh, really?  67 years old.  Served by David, our intern David.  I remember radio guys, when they got fired or quit or whatever, or moved on to a bigger job,  and they would take all their celebrity IDs with them and cut out, like, Rock 107.  Because now they're working at, I don't know, Rock 108.  Yeah.  And they would string them all together, like, you know, and make it sound like, holy shit,  this guy's pretty impressive. 
[00:57:30]  He's only been on the air a week here in Wichita.  But look at all the big celebrities he's had on already.  Yeah.  When, remember when K-Rock changed format?  Did we do it?  No.  This was before us.  And they took all of KROQ's shit and just put it on their station.  Oh, yeah.  You're right.  They said, yeah, and you're listening to K-Rock.  And it was just, it wasn't that K-Rock.  It was the L.A. K-Rock.  It was the L.A. K-Rock.  You're right.  I forgot about that.  Yeah.  So all of a sudden, the new K-Rock here in New York was on the air for a week. 
[00:58:00]  Oh, they had IDs for everyone.  A week.  It was a day.  Yeah.  Like that day, they're like, hey, you're listening to K-Rock.  Like all those people cared enough to do that for them.  No, that was all old shit.  On day one.  All right.  By the way, Bill Burr's calling at 8 o'clock.  He's got a big announcement, and he wants to make it on our show, which is pretty cool.  Oh.  Gee?  Closet?  Yeah, I think it's going to be the gay thing.  Popping out of the closet?  I think so, yeah.  That's good.  It's about time with him.  Yeah.  And Joe DeRosa's stopping by to say hi. 
[00:58:30]  Joe?  Um, Reverend Al Sharpton?  Yeah.  Yeah.  We were just talking about him and his horrid Twitter.  So I followed.  Al Sharpton is the shortest follow I've ever had on Twitter.  I followed him for exactly four minutes.  No.  Yep.  Four minutes.  And you realized he wasn't going to do anything?  Yeah.  I realized it was just every single one was a plug for where he's appearing.  Huh.  Yeah.  I thought it was going to be good.  Like, he'll mention some race shit, and then I could go in there and jump in, do a little 
[00:59:00]  debating.  But he's not about that.  It's all business with him.  It's all about chasing the Yankee dollar.  Does he ever smile?  Yeah.  It's always that scowl.  Very angry.  Always that scowl.  Very angry.  I was listening to some black conspiracies yesterday.  Wowie, kazowie.  What?  Well, between the riots that are going on.  Oh, yeah.  There's a conspiracy theory with that, right?  Yeah.  Oh, no.  There's a conspiracy theory with the Navy SEALs, too. 
[00:59:30]  With that, and the Wisconsin fair, with the blacks beating up white people outside the  Wisconsin state fair, there's a conspiracy that that never happened.  There's no video of it, and they pumped it up in the news because Wisconsin was holding  a special election to try to get Democrats in office, and that made them look bad. 
[01:00:00]  It made the Republicans look like they were tough on this kind of crime and everything,  and the Republicans wound up holding the seats.  But did it happen at the state fair?  Yeah, I didn't see any video.  I don't know.  That's what one black guy on video was saying.  He's like, this guy sounded a little kooky, but he's like, he said that Walker, Governor  Walker, paid blacks to riot a little bit.  Oh, Jesus.  But it wasn't as bad as he said, and then the media blew it up, so it was just so ludicrous 
[01:00:30]  and ridiculous.  I spent yesterday, a lot of people were asking why I wasn't on Twitter yesterday as much.  You, too.  They're like, why are you tweeting a lot today?  That's the guy.  Why are you tweeting a lot?  Some days I got stuff, other days I just kind of hang back.  I was doing a little research.  I was back, you know, on the sites that I usually hit, a lot of racial sites.  Getting some knowledge.  Getting some new info.  Because with everything happening in England and this Wisconsin thing and the multitude of 
[01:01:00]  flash mobs that are going on.  Philly had to put in a curfew.  Yeah, we got that story.  To these flash mobs.  So I just wanted to, you know, delve back in, get a little more info on race relations  here in the United States and the world, and see what's going on.  I came up on this guy, and he's just like, oh my God.  You want to play him?  He sounds so gay, too.  Which one is this?  This is the guy that says that the Wisconsin State Fair thing never happened. 
[01:01:30]  The black guy saying it was all Governor Walker's.  He staged it to keep the Republicans' seats in this special election in Wisconsin.  Let's play this.  Did Governor Walker stage Wisconsin State Fair attack?  Hey, everyone.  I know some of you have been talking like Dim Cat out there, who I listen to from time  to time, have been talking about this Wisconsin State Fair riot.  And some of you ate it up hook, line, and sinker as if all this happened and these 500 black 
[01:02:00]  kids went off and they beat everybody up that was white and yada, yada, yada.  I don't for a moment believe it.  Here's why, having worked in politics, the timing.  It just so happens that tomorrow, Tuesday, Wisconsin will face arguably the most, one of  the most important elections in its history.  The Republican senator recall election, where potentially, and it looks like it's going 
[01:02:30]  to happen, six Wisconsin Republican senators will be wiped out and replaced with their  Democratic challengers in the wake of Governor Scott Walker's despicable behavior.  But, ah, wouldn't it be interesting?  Wouldn't it be cool?  Wouldn't it be great?  If the governor could cook up a plan where he got someone that he really didn't know  who was, but his aides did, or maybe an operative to his aides, to pay African American youth 
[01:03:00]  to go in and get anyone who was white because maybe these kids were brainwashed to think,  hey, this is part of an uprising, you can do this, you get paid, and we're going to make  headlines and we're going to make change and we'll pay you for it, right?  We will pay you for it.  Can you believe that?  He's a lunatic, though.  He's a crazy guy.  But you know what happened?  What's the problem here?  The Republicans kept the seats. 
[01:03:30]  So there's, ah.  So the, ah, yeah, the, ah, you know, the local, um, uh, Wisconsin, uh, uh, Republicans held  on.  Um, what's going on with the flash mobs?  It's out of fucking control.  Is it through Twitter?  Yeah.  How do you know, though?  Well, that seems to be the social networking, uh, engine for, for flash mobs.  And, uh, they're, they're pulling up to convenience stores, 15 car loads at a clip, running in, and 
[01:04:00]  within three minutes, destroying the place, grabbing anything they want, walking out.  They don't even run anymore.  I've seen ones where they're just milling about, like they're shopping.  And, uh, and, and, uh, they don't care about cameras or anything.  Then they just get back in their cars and they leave.  Other ones are more violent, where they show up and, and, and punch people.  You know, that old, uh, uh, blindside punch to the side of the head.  And then you got five of them kicking you in the face while you're on the ground. 
[01:04:30]  It's always nice and fair that way.  Uh, but, but, uh, I guess Philly's, um, mayor came out against that and said, uh, he, he actually  had some balls and said, look, you motherfuckers, you're, you're ruining it for black people.  Look at this, just in there, stealing, pushing shit over.  Now, if you start firing, what happens to you?  Nah, you're probably getting big trouble.  Why do you get in big trouble if your store's being completely taken over?  Well, you gotta prove that. 
[01:05:00]  It depends on what state you're in.  But, uh, in New York, you really would have to prove that your life is being threatened.  You felt imminent, uh, danger for your life.  Is this happening on a regular basis, Ant?  Yeah, this is.  What's the frequency of these, uh, flash mobs?  I'm seeing at least one in the news a day.  Really?  Which isn't, I guess, that much.  But it's enough.  It's just enough where it's like, you look at white people flash mobs and they're doing  fucking thriller dances at railroad stations and shit like that. 
[01:05:30]  Bunch of fat broads and wedding dresses.  Yeah.  Yeah, but, uh, the, and they always say teen mob, young teens, unruly teens, which, by the  way, I think I fucking noticed that one first.  Wait a minute.  Unruly teens.  This is, uh, Dunkin' Donuts in New York City?  Yep.  What happened in New York City?  Where?  Oh, they came in, they fucking.  What part of New York City at?  I don't know where that was.  Uh, Greenwich Village.  Christopher Street.  Oh, same. 
[01:06:00]  What's going on there in our Dunkin' Donuts?  Uh, I think that, uh, I think you gotta update the reference.  Yeah, yeah.  I think the geese moved out of there.  Yeah, they did, but Christopher Street still is.  I think they're taking over the Chelsea now, right?  I think Christopher Street's still, uh, they're holding on to Christopher Street.  You think they're holding on?  Yeah.  I think maybe the old geese.  The older geese?  The ones that wear the leather chants.  The old queens?  Yeah, they're still hanging on over there.  The new geese have moved, uh, to the west side.  There's just these, like, mobs of, of black people just running and, and wreaking havoc 
[01:06:30]  with these flash mobs.  Fuck.  I don't know.  Well, here's, uh, the Philadelphia mayor.  Big story today.  Now, you are around for the sex.  Now be around for the parenting.  Be around for the parenting, because let me tell you something.  Yeah, this speech always works.  The immaculate perception of our Lord Jesus Christ took place a long time ago, and it 
[01:07:00]  didn't happen here in Philadelphia.  So every one of these kids has two parents who are around and participating at the time.  They need to be around now.  There ain't no immaculate perception happening up in here.  They need to step up before we have to step to you.  See, we're looking at a fun flash mob at an L.A. Target store. 
[01:07:30]  Yeah, it's a bunch of fat housewives, and they're doing, like, a dance.  One of those electric slide-type dances.  They're doing a dance out of nowhere.  Yeah, look at that.  That's just fun for everybody.  And everybody looks and smiles, and then they applaud, and it's over, and it's done.  When you see 50 black people in a flash mob getting into a store...  Oh, boy.  Run!  Run!  Run!  There gonna be some violence.  So the mayor is just babbling about what? 
[01:08:00]  Yeah, that was one clip, but he got into another one where he's telling young black men to pull  their fucking pants up.  I got it.  Yeah.  I'm just having a problem, because I don't know why people have to comment as a speech  is going on.  Yeah.  Oh, but they have to.  Oh, yeah.  Wait for the end, and then you can applaud and do whatever.  That's right.  That's right.  Customs, the old Baptist church days.  Everyone's a preacher.  If they're giving a speech, you're a preacher, and you gotta, you know, yell back, so Jesus hears 
[01:08:30]  you.  Where does that come from?  The old days.  Yeah, but why?  The oldie days of church.  Does anyone know why people have to comment when, like, sermons are going on?  It was so revved up.  But it had to start somewhere.  I like the origin of some of this shit.  I don't know.  It seems like black people really like getting involved in that whole thing.  They get all revved up with a preacher, and they gotta comment.  It's like this behavior could have actually resulted in even more injuries or worse. 
[01:09:00]  They could have killed somebody.  Oh, shit.  Yeah.  Oh, then they'd really be in a world of trouble.  Then all of a sudden, they'd be crying.  I want my mom.  I need my dad.  I need somebody.  No, it's too late then.  No, no, no.  We're past that.  Listen to that.  It's too late.  It's too late.  You've damaged yourself.  You've damaged another person. 
[01:09:30]  You've damaged your peers.  And quite honestly, you've damaged your own race.  Yeah.  Yeah.  You've damaged your own race.  So, to our young people, if you want black folks, if you want white folks, Latinos, Asians,  or anybody else to respect you and not be afraid when they see you walking down the street,  then leave the innocent people who are walking down the street, minding their own damn business,  leave them alone.  Stop it.  Cut it out. 
[01:10:00]  We've had enough of this nonsense going on.  We've had enough.  Well, I mean, this is something you've yelled about for years.  You know, here's a leader trying to fucking make a change.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  I see nothing coming of this.  Nothing changing.  But at least one guy is trying.  A guy in some relative power, a mayor, a black gentleman, and he's addressing the problem  in realistic terms.  No blame, no nothing. 
[01:10:30]  Just saying, knock it the fuck off.  Good for him.  He has some suggestions for black kids.  Yes, he does.  Some suggestions.  Are they laughable?  It's just never going to happen.  All right, let's listen.  It's not cool to listen to the mayor.  If you want all of us, black, white, or any other color,  if you want us to respect you,  if you want us to look at you in a different way,  if you want us not to be afraid to walk down the same side of the street with you, 
[01:11:00]  if you want folks not to jump out of the elevator when you get on.  The thing is, a lot of these, the thuggery that's going on,  they want people to be afraid of them.  They want to be intimidating because it gives them that sense of power that they lack everywhere else.  So they want, they love it when people are fucking intimidated by them.  That's why they're fucking doing it.  If you want folks not to jump out of the elevator when you get on, 
[01:11:30]  if you want folks to stop following you around in stores when you're out shopping,  if you want somebody to offer you a job or an internship somewhere,  if you don't want folks to be looking in or trying to go in a different direction  when they see two or twenty of you coming down the street,  then stop acting like idiots and fools down the streets of the city of Philadelphia.  Just cut it out.  And another thing.  You know you want to say something else.  Oh, yeah.  Stop acting.  Stop acting like fools. 
[01:12:00]  Like fools.  Take those doggone hoodies down, especially in the summer.  Pull your pants up and buy a belt  because no one wants to see your underwear on the back of your butt.  Nobody.  Buy a belt.  Buy a belt.  Nobody wants to see your underwear. 
[01:12:30]  Comb your hair.  And get some grooming stuff.  Comb your hair.  Run around here with your hair all over the place.  You know, it's a good set.  Good comedy routine.  He's doing a good job.  He's killing for the crowd.  But the problem is, like you said, you said it perfectly.  No one wants to listen to their mayor.  No, it's lost on, you know, he's preaching to the converted already.  These are people that are pissed off and upset already. 
[01:13:00]  And he's just reiterating what they're thinking.  The actual thugs, they look at that shit and go, fuck you, motherfucker.  Of course.  You mayor fucking Uncle Tom bitch motherfucker.  Of course.  I wear my pants around my knees.  I don't give a shit.  Of fucking course.  Mm-hmm.  Well, I mean, at least he's trying it.  Yeah, and he said, you know, if you go in to try to get a job and your hair's a wreck  and you got a fucking pick on the back of your head and you got tats on your neck and 
[01:13:30]  you're wearing a hoodie in fucking August, your sneakers are untied, they're not going  to fucking hire you.  Not because you're black, but because you fucking look like an idiot.  I got a report from the streets.  Oh, from the streets.  I was down in Philly over the weekend.  The tattoos have moved from the neck to the face.  To the face.  That's good.  We are past the neck tattoos now.  They have now moved to the face.  I saw more face tattoos than I've ever seen in my life this past weekend. 
[01:14:00]  That's fantastic.  You know, not every person I saw, but I saw enough where I went, okay, they have moved  the tattoos north of the neck now.  Yeah, that'll help.  That'll help, really, with people giving you jobs.  I saw a guy who had a sun under one eye and a moon under the other eye.  This guy's got an ice cream cone with lightning bolts coming out of it on the side of his face. 
[01:14:30]  That's Gucci.  Oh, it's Gucci.  Burr.  Right.  We talked to him.  Burr.  I mean, we talked about him.  Jason in Jersey.  What's up, Jason?  Hey, man.  Come on, Jason.  Come on.  This is Keith.  I don't know if you're up.  All right.  Keith, how are you?  It's all you.  How are you?  All right.  And, Anthony, I just want to say kudos to you because I've been listening to you since the 90s,  and you've always been straightforward with your message. 
[01:15:00]  The Philadelphia mayor, in his speech, what he's doing is basically saying that after this speech,  you get caught doing this, my Philadelphia police force is going to come down and rain hell on you  and watch out because that's going to be the end all.  Well, that's a good thing.  That's fucking great.  Good, good.  Finally, someone doing something or trying to do something.  But they'll run him out. 
[01:15:30]  Yep.  Thank you very much for getting your message across.  We try, sir.  All right.  You got it.  God bless America.  Ah, yes.  Black Republican checking in.  Black Republican, what's up?  Oh, the other guy.  Hey, good morning, guys.  Good morning.  You know, Anthony, you know, I totally agree with the mayor, but, you know, it's just like you just said.  They don't think it's cool to listen to a mayor.  No.  I think what really needs to happen is they need to stop perpetuating these bullshit images in the media  because, you know, the thing about it, they should make the N-word just like a curse word. 
[01:16:00]  They should make it unmentionable in most media.  And on top of that, maybe if they stop showing, you know, these thugs with the pants below their ass  and making them look cool because it's really not cool.  You know, that's something gay people do in jail.  But it's never been marketed that way.  And the problem is everybody dresses exactly like what they see because they just follow.  So who should stop showing these images?  Well, I'll tell you what.  You named some people for me who sell these images. 
[01:16:30]  You named some people at the head of these media companies who make billions of dollars  while these people are walking around looking like morons.  You named some people for me.  I think a lot of hip-hop labels and videos.  Absolutely.  But, you know, the problem with them is they're just out trying to make some money.  So they don't give a shit what they act like because if you really – you met 50 Cent.  You brought them on the show.  You know him, Jay-Z, you know that they're not like these sociopaths that you see on the street. 
[01:17:00]  Yeah, but there is a – there is something that goes on when you sacrifice making money  for perpetuating negative stereotypes on your people.  You know what I mean?  You're right.  There is something that you sacrifice.  You go broke and then you get homeless.  And nobody wants that.  So what are you saying is a solution to that?  Well, I'll tell you something, Anthony.  I used to live in China because, you know, basically every time I call up, I tell you something new about myself.  But the thing about it is I'm black. 
[01:17:30]  I speak Chinese.  I'm a science teacher.  I already told you that.  But the thing about it is, like, in China, the government there controls their media so that bad images of their people,  bad images that other countries say about them never get out.  So the thing about it is if they're marketing this shit, people are acting like that.  I mean, if you turn on television, it's the most lascivious things you'd ever see.  I mean, South Park and all these shows have these kids running around using the word rape like it's nothing.  And I can't hear the – I can't believe the things that come out of these kids' mouths. 
[01:18:00]  But unlike China, my friend, we do have a First Amendment right.  I understand there's a First Amendment right, but the thing about it is the First Amendment is not –  the First Amendment doesn't extend past the FCC.  There's certain things you can and you cannot say based on what the government says aloud over the airway.  Yeah, but that's just cursing and inciting riots.  It has nothing to do with being able to sit there and discuss race and inequity and crime and –  Inciting riots. Why is it not a crime or why are people being prosecuted for inciting flash mobs? 
[01:18:30]  Well, they should be.  But they're doing it on social media and when they turn violent,  they take the videos and try to identify the people and arrest them, you know?  So you mean to tell me that the government can scan and monitor for terrorist planning an attack,  but they can't scan and monitor domestically for somebody who's trying to incite a flash mob?  Well, I don't think they can really get to everybody within the minutes it really takes to get people together, 
[01:19:00]  organized and on Twitter and pick a location and go there and rob a store and leave within three minutes.  No, I really don't think the technology is there to stop them.  Maybe what they should do is they should hire snitches.  You know what the thing is? It's a deeper problem than that.  And I'm not talking about just snitches or more cops or more security or something.  It's this deep-seated thought process in the young black community that has to be dealt with. 
[01:19:30]  And that's something internal. That's something whitey can't do, government can't do.  It's something black people have to do on their own without casting blame.  They have to get a stronger family unit, a stronger community bond.  I think blacks have the most phony, bullshit community bond.  They talk about unity in the community, and the next thing they're doing is robbing, raping, beating, and killing each other over shit. 
[01:20:00]  Anthony, no.  In all fairness, see, here's the problem.  The blacks who have good jobs and have good careers and have money, they're the ones who actually look like these images that you see on these movies,  like when you're watching one of these movies that comes out, these sitcoms like Tyler Perry makes.  The problem is you have a large amount of uneducated, poor people living on welfare and systematically creating new kids on welfare. 
[01:20:30]  It's like I don't really know half the people's names in my community because they're people who move in and move out,  and basically you never get to know them, and you never know whether or not one of them may be a criminal.  But criminals everywhere, and they come in all colors.  But see, here's the problem.  The education system in this country sucks compared to every other country.  And every single year they're trying to cut it back.  I'm not going to agree with that.  In the old days, they used to teach ethics. 
[01:21:00]  In the old days, they used to teach these kids.  They used to say, listen, your community you have responsibility for from the time they were kids up until they were old.  They used to do that.  Well, now.  The education system here is bullshit.  In fact, they don't give the teachers enough to even teach these kids and to get materials into the classroom to make these kids intelligent.  Fuck the teaching ethics and shit in school.  That should be done with parents and community. 
[01:21:30]  Schools should teach you math, English, grammar, shit that will make it possible for you to go to an employer and sound like a fucking human being,  get a job, and be a contributing member of society.  The ethics, morality, and all that shit should come from the community, your parents, your extended family,  not your grandma that can't raise your ass because she couldn't raise her own fucking kid because she took off,  and that's why she's stuck with the grandkid. 
[01:22:00]  There's a problem inherent in the black community that only the black community can solve and without casting blame.  I'm not trying to cast blame, Anthony, but what I'm saying is what happens when you develop a subgroup that's so large that they can only perpetuate failure and you're...  You don't think that there is so much opportunity for blacks out there these days as far as schooling goes and grants and loans, 
[01:22:30]  but there seems to be a... that that isn't cool enough to fucking do, to work your way through high school, graduate...  I'm not trying to make an excuse.  In fact, a lot of the things you're saying I agree with, but you've got to look at the larger picture.  First of all, unemployment is around 20% right now, and that's not just blacks.  That's whites across this entire country.  That's part of the reason why Obama got into office in the first place, because the eight years of Bush put him there. 
[01:23:00]  But on top of that, what I'm trying to say is, school...  You're talking about school as if when people go to school, they just go to school and come out.  When you go to school, school now is about accumulating debt.  When you go to school, you're taking out loans.  The schools let you in just because they want to get your financial aid money.  They don't give a shit whether or not you graduate at this point.  But do you know how a young black person has it when they actually make it through high school, graduate, and want to go to college? 
[01:23:30]  Do you know that people are fucking dying to get a fucking college student that is a well-read, well-educated black student in their school?  Do you know that that is a fucking prize?  But not enough people are taking advantage of that because they'd rather go through the easy way of slinging fucking dope or hanging out on the corner or fucking ripping off stores.  You take it for granted that everybody sees that or everybody has that view where they actually believe that they're ever going to make it out of the situation that they're in. 
[01:24:00]  See, I was lucky.  I had a bunch of educators, and whoever was an educator was working in the police force.  But it's available.  I was lucky for that.  No, but not everybody has that.  I could name more than enough people who they don't even see getting past high school.  In fact, when they get to high school, they're probably going to drop out because they're doing so poorly in their K through 12. 
[01:24:30]  Why?  No, what I'm saying is this country's education system sucks.  If they don't reform the education system, then the shitty parenting that you get at home is never going to be turned around.  They'll never be able to break the cycle.  It can't be Americans selling other American shit made from China.  It has to be Americans selling American things.  Yeah, well, that goes into a whole other thing that we can't get into, and it's beyond this conversation. 
[01:25:00]  I'm just strictly talking about the fact that opportunities for blacks in 2011 are better than they've ever, ever been.  And what we're seeing is more debauchery than I've ever seen.  I think we had more opportunities back in, like, 2001, 2002, when the Federal Reserve was pumping all that money out there.  Well, we're all broke now.  Yeah.  That's the problem.  That's the problem.  See, what nobody talks about is the fact that every goddamn thing you buy is made in China. 
[01:25:30]  They've figured out ways to make shit cheaper.  They get the stuff here.  Every dime you spend goes to China.  Think about that.  Yeah.  No, I know that's a problem, but I'm just trying to simplify it.  It sounds like you saw the movie Looking for Superman.  Is that true?  No, I didn't see that movie.  Because it really is a documentary on how fucked up the school system is in this country, and it was an eye-opener for me.  But my question, and it goes back to what Ant was saying, like how the black community has to take care of themselves. 
[01:26:00]  So now you've got a whole black community that understands that they believe that their schools are shit, right?  Right.  So why aren't they pumping money into their own fucking school systems?  You've got all these guys.  Hold on.  Part two of the question.  You've got all these guys that are leaving the community, you know, black guys, black women that are incredibly successful.  So why aren't they now going back realizing how bad the problem is from where they came from, I guess, and pumping up the neighborhood? 
[01:26:30]  Opie, you know, I really wish that there were enough black millionaires and billionaires to actually do that.  But the problem is, as I was saying, the situation got so bad that ultimately you have such a large subgroup that has no aspiration and is broke as shit.  These people are, a lot of them, and I can't just say them because, as you know, the majority of America at this point is on food stamps and welfare.  They talk about the fact that 50% of Americans don't pay taxes. 
[01:27:00]  The thing about it is 50% don't have the money, and they're not willing to go to a fair tax because they know that if they did a fair tax, everybody would know what everybody else was paying in taxes.  They're not willing to do that.  Well, not 50%.  All right.  We have billions of dollars we pay.  But why aren't they even trying?  You've got Oprah, right?  She pushed off.  Oprah set up a school in Africa.  That's what I'm going to do.  Hold on.  But that's my point.  Why not?  You know, they always say charity begins at home.  Why the fuck did she feel like she had to, like, take care of Africa before she took care of, you know, the suburbs of Chicago where she, you know, made all her fucking money? 
[01:27:30]  Well, you know, that's a –  I shouldn't say suburbs.  I'll tell you what my –  The inner city, obviously.  I'll tell you what my fucking take is on that.  A complete lack of appreciation and a complete misuse of funds.  It was probably easier for her to go to Africa and get appreciative Africans that wanted to be educated than it would be to set up a school in Detroit, have the computers stolen, have the fucking schools vandalized, and get right back to square one with another shit fucking school. 
[01:28:00]  You believe that it was just a waste of time?  I think it would be a waste of money at this point.  There's – because there – it all starts with a complete lack of respect for themselves, the community, parents, elders, people that are working, people that make money, businesses in the neighborhood.  Everything is shit if you're not fucking doing it yourself.  Right.  Okay, Anthony, and I agree. 
[01:28:30]  I absolutely agree with that, but I want you to do me a favor.  Take a look back in not even – just recent history.  Take a look back, and when Detroit was turning out cars, and they had strong unions, and they had money in their community instead of fucking buying everything from fucking China and Europe.  I want you to think about that.  Did we have the same problems then that we have now?  They're selling this country out.  Nobody's talking about that.  Oh, I know.  No, we've been talking about that, and I know, and I think – and I catch a lot of shit about this, 
[01:29:00]  but I think the unions have really undermined what this country can do, can make, and it's driven producers to go elsewhere for jobs.  Well, you're saying driven producers out.  Cheap labor.  Listen, as far as I'm concerned, the unions are basically there to try to make sure that the workers are at least treated like humans.  The option is for the corporations to take their money to all these Asian countries where these kids get paid nothing, and I fucking – I lived in China. 
[01:29:30]  In third grade, they teach Chinese kids how to solder fucking electronics.  Even in Africa, they teach these kids how to put together computers and stuff just so some corporation can come in there, employ them for a dollar per day.  So if you – well, obviously there are extremes on both sides, but do you honestly think General Motors wants to pump out cars that are made completely here in the United States  that would cost three times the amount that no one would buy?  They'd be sitting in lots somewhere because no one could afford to buy a car that is totally built in the U.S. by union labor. 
[01:30:00]  Well, there are cars that are built in America by union labor, and for one thing, the new Chrysler 200 for one – and I'm a Chrysler man.  In fact, if you look on YouTube, big truck series review –  Thought you'd have been a caddy guy myself.  But hold on.  All I'm saying is this.  If it wasn't for greed and it wasn't for the fact that they're trying to make as much profit as possible – and I understand they're trying to keep the company afloat,  but if it wasn't for these people who retire with $15, $16, $20 million gold in contracts or more, if they – here's the thing. 
[01:30:30]  If they know that they're using a community to build a product, then don't you think it makes more sense for them to basically reinvest that money into the product?  Because that's what these public schools basically were supposed to be.  They were supposed to be an investment into your future workforce.  But what happens when you still have the public schools, you still have the unions, you still have the union jobs, but you send all the fucking work to China? 
[01:31:00]  Think about that.  There's no fucking – there's really no jobs.  The only people that get employed are people who are very highly educated and have multiple degrees.  But when you go to school, you need about $100,000 to get multiple degrees.  I do see your point, man.  I totally see that point.  I'm not trying to make excuses for these people.  Yeah.  When you're on and you're talking about Planet of the Apes and correlating that shit to – and I saw Planet of the Apes.  I thought the movie was okay.  Yeah, I thought it was all right.  But the thing about it is when you're correlating that – and I understand that you're a comedian and I love you. 
[01:31:30]  Thank you, sir.  I understand that you're making jokes, but I just want people to understand if you don't look and see this larger picture, you've got to get out of this country.  You need to go – China, you need to go to Japan.  That's what I was saying about you.  That's what I do, man.  Yo, dude, I speak Mandarin.  I speak Mandarin Chinese.  I read, write, speak, and type the shit.  And I'm a six-foot, fucking six, like 350-pound black guy.  And I scare the shit out of people when they listen to me. 
[01:32:00]  But the whole thing –  You must have scared the Chinese.  You need to get out of this country.  You need to take a look outside of this place.  Because the problem – what I realized when I left this country, if you don't get out of this country and look back, you won't understand how the world is moving past us.  Obama doesn't come right out and say it.  I wish he would.  But these other countries are doing things with all money.  I know, I know, but –  It's fucking infuriating.  Let me tell you something. 
[01:32:30]  I do think that we have a lot of burdens that we have to deal with in this country.  And I'm not just talking strictly race here.  There are a lot of burdens that we need to take care of.  And there are a lot of things we need to take care of here without sending billions of dollars to other nations for what?  I have no idea.  I think it's just blackmail money.  No, it's welfare.  When we say Africa, we're digging up their natural resources.  We're digging up coal tan. 
[01:33:00]  We're digging up all their gold.  We're bringing that over here.  We're giving those people guns so they can kill each other because those Africans don't make guns.  Don't make – wait, wait, wait, wait.  Don't make it sound like we're the cause of African fucking unrest because those people have been hacking each other apart with machetes for fucking millennia.  And there's just something odd going on in sub-Saharan Africa that I just can't figure out.  But people love killing other people down there.  No, but ultimately people love killing people everywhere. 
[01:33:30]  I mean, you really can't look at Europe.  Yeah, but there is an element of civilization that has taken place that kind of keeps people, holds them back a little bit, that doesn't seem to have grasped on in sub-Saharan Africa.  It's a –  Greed, poverty, lack of education, and access to guns and fucking weapons.  Well, all right.  You know what?  We're going to have to end the conversation here.  Bill Burr is calling up with a very important announcement.  But I enjoyed the discussion, man. 
[01:34:00]  I love you.  I love you.  I love Opie.  I love you guys.  I listen to you every morning.  Thank you, my friend.  What's your name, brother?  You call us the black Republican all the time.  What's your real name?  John.  John, all right.  If you go on YouTube, look at Big Truck Series Review.  That's my page.  And I got a lot of Chrysler reviews.  I got a Mercedes S550 because I'm a car man.  I love cars.  Did you get any Chinese pussy?  Oh, shit, man.  If you look on my YouTube page, there's a video of me letting my girlfriend drive my supercharged SRTA 300C this weekend. 
[01:34:30]  She spent the summer with me.  I love Chinese.  I love, like, lots of women.  But you're 6'6", and the women over there are what, 4'10"?  No, no, no.  I'm, like, 3'6".  Huh?  I'm a huge fucking guy, though.  No, I know.  I said you're 6'6", and you were going out with Chinese brugs.  Yeah, they usually were pretty small.  I went to school over there, one of the Ivy League schools, and I was learning Chinese over there.  And, basically, you know, you meet people.  The girls want to be your friend.  They want to be your language partner.  Mom, the goal here is to get all yous back to China. 
[01:35:00]  Oh, wait a minute.  All right, brother.  Next time I go to China, I'm going to ask for our jobs back.  All right.  Until you do that, help us out.  All right, man.  We do have to take a break.  Thanks, man.  Later, man.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  The virus.  Serious.  This is the Opinetry Show.  Show.  Show.  Show.  Show's getting busy.  We got Joe DeRozan in studio.  Hey, guys.  And Bill Burr has been waiting on hold for 15 minutes. 
[01:35:30]  Oh, shit.  He's a VIP.  What's up, Mr. Burr?  Hey, what's going on, guys?  How are you, man?  Hello, Bill.  I'm doing excellent.  Congratulations on Breaking Bad.  Holy shit.  How many episodes have you got?  I did one other one.  I think I'll be on, like, episode 9 or 10.  Yeah, I think you're in cahoots with the family there.  I think you're in cahoots.  You think I'm in cahoots? 
[01:36:00]  I think you're in cahoots.  Yeah.  Well, I got to tell you, I have no idea what I'm...  They only give you...  You don't get the whole script.  Yeah, they don't want people...  It's a secret over there, so it's a little...  You just get your little chunk that you're doing.  But I'm such a huge fan of the show, I actually am glad they do it that way.  Because, you know, I've been watching that show since day one.  Yeah, you don't want to spoil it by being in it.  You don't want that to wreck it for you.  When I got the part on that, I felt like a Star Wars fan that somehow got to be in one of the episodes. 
[01:36:30]  Yeah, yeah.  And you get to play, like, a Stormtrooper.  And you're, like, putting on the suit going, am I really in this?  This is ridiculous.  That was cool.  That's awesome.  You sure showed that car wash guy.  Oh, that's right.  Him with his hairy eyebrows.  I know.  How do you look at those eyebrows?  I love that show, man.  It's fucking great.  Yeah, no.  It's awesome.  And they shoot it out in New Mexico, which was a place I'd never been to. 
[01:37:00]  And it's...  I don't know, man.  It's beautiful out there.  There's, like, no traffic.  There's hardly anybody out there.  So, with all this crap that's going on in the economy, that's a good place to hole up.  Yeah, you just sit there and wait it out.  Easy to get a gun.  You just buy a place with some well water.  You start growing some zucchini.  You get your weight up going.  You're all right.  I love it.  You realize the world's problems aren't that bad if you hang out in a small town.  Because, you know, that small town's not going to be taken over anytime soon. 
[01:37:30]  They're going to go for the big cities first, right?  Absolutely.  And you, like, know all the cops.  All you do is you make them, like, a bundt cake, like, every six months.  Bundt cake.  And you're good.  Yeah, you live in a city.  Yeah, it's crazy.  It's going to be like gangs in New York.  I was actually working in Reno recently.  Yeah, I was out in Nevada.  And I went to this place, Bazaar, it was a Bazaar guitarist.  It was a guitar store and gun shop, all in the same, like, strip mall. 
[01:38:00]  It's one of the greatest stores I've ever been to in my life.  That sounds fantastic.  You would have loved it, dude.  I walked in there and I saw, like, six handguns that were in, like, probably, you know, five of my favorite movies.  They had, like, the Dirty Harry .44 Magnum.  Yeah, yeah.  It was only, like, $850.  Isn't that great?  It costs thousands.  Oh, he picked that up.  It was the actual gun, Bill?  It wasn't, like...  No, no, no.  It's the same, like, it's the same style.  Same make. 
[01:38:30]  Same make and model.  It's like Magnum 4th.  The Dirty Harry guns hanging out in a mall?  What's wrong with you?  I thought that's why it was, like, I was surprised how cheap it was.  I thought it was, like, movie memorabilia.  I think if you're going to buy something that costs, uh, that can kill somebody, it would cost more than, like, a clock is as much as an iPod.  It's like, hey, am I going to listen to all of the ABBA catalogs, or am I going to blow someone away?  Got to make those, uh, choices sometimes.  Hey, you saw this whole economy thing, um, you know, a while ago, Bill. 
[01:39:00]  You warned all of us.  Yeah, and I remember talking about that, and a particular sidekick calling me a conspiracy theory jackass.  Granted, it was all the stuff I watched on YouTube and read on Wikipedia, but, uh...  I mean, I don't know.  I don't know, dude.  I've got to be honest with you.  I kind of let all that Alex Jones stuff go.  It's just too, uh...  It just freaks you out after a while.  Too stressful.  At some point, yeah, you've got to get a dog and go to the movies, because there's really nothing you can do. 
[01:39:30]  Yeah, and you're right there.  There's nothing you can do.  You just get on the roller coaster and hope it stops at some point.  You can get off.  I just hope I'm not too close to the riots when they happen in America.  You're going to be right in the middle of them.  I know.  That's what I'm thinking.  Fuck!  We're in the riot city, baby.  Yeah.  I mean, it's just a matter of time before we have riots in America.  NYPD handles things different than the fucking English police, though.  I'll tell you that much.  It's going to be New York. 
[01:40:00]  We said Philly.  I think Philly will go wild.  I think New York is ground...  Say it again.  Ground zero for the riots.  They're coming, I'm telling you.  I'll tell you.  I throw L.A. in there.  L.A.?  L.A.  Yeah, L.A. is right there.  But L.A.'s spread out, though, man.  I don't think it's...  This city technically has no water supply, and I think if the shit hits the fan, somebody's  going to turn off the spigot upriver, and it's going to be a shit show. 
[01:40:30]  Yeah.  Let's turn it back into a desert.  I think New York...  That is creepy that L.A. really doesn't have a water source.  It'll be fine.  It's fucked up.  It'll be fine here.  Oh, good.  Thanks.  Oh, really, Joe?  Thanks, Joe.  Joe DeRose has said things are going to be fine.  We thought the Dirty Harry gun was in a mall somewhere.  No.  New York's got a certain camaraderie.  Riots aren't going to happen here.  When's the last time a riot happened in New York City?  It is odd.  I think it was like the blackout of 1967 or something.  Riots don't really happen here, man. 
[01:41:00]  Yeah, but when was the last time there was a...  Probably, I would guess, around the Depression.  I imagine that there was a lot of rioting going on.  There was rioting going on when the Federal Reserve decided to impose income taxes.  There's been a lot of riots there, Joe.  Yeah, a lot of riots.  But in recent years, I mean, this place doesn't even riot when the sports events happen.  These other cities, Philadelphia, there's riots over sporting events and stuff.  I don't see New York City rioting.  I wonder when someone sounds more uninformed than me.  You're awesome, Joe. 
[01:41:30]  Joe acting like he's some historian of New York.  Hey, you know, I've been here eight years.  You've only been here eight years, Joe?  Only eight years, my friend.  After 9-11.  Right after.  I don't acknowledge people that came here after 9-11.  Oh, is that it?  They're not real New Yorkers?  That's the cutoff.  Oh, God.  I came right after.  I came a month after.  No, I didn't.  A year after.  But listen, let's not split hairs.  That's the cutoff, though. 
[01:42:00]  You're all newbies.  Well, what do you want from me?  I was here on 9-11, 2002.  I seen it.  I was in the mix.  If you didn't smell flesh and plastic, I don't want to talk to you, Joe.  I think I agree with Joe, though.  I don't think New York is really kind of a riot-y place.  Thank you, Anthony.  I really don't see it happening in New York.  There's a camaraderie.  I think you're kind of right.  There's a respect that the citizens in New York have for this city. 
[01:42:30]  They respect.  Thank you, Bill.  Thank you, Bill.  I love you, Joe.  You're a jackass.  The problem is, in Norway, you've got a bunch of Norwegians, all right?  Sweden, you've got a bunch of Swedish people.  Here, it's gangs in New York straight across the country.  As long as there's enough food, water, and money, we're cool.  The second that goes out the window, it's over. 
[01:43:00]  Well, that is true.  The second the food and water gets turned off, I give it a day and a half to two days at most.  Dude, when the blackout happened, there was no power, and everybody thought it was terrorists and stuff.  People were drinking and dancing in the streets.  No one freaked out.  That'll stop after day two.  But see, Joe, that's your reference point, me and Hank, because we're old-time New Yorkers.  The other fucking blackout, this place was a fucking scare.  What year?  77?  When it was very difficult to loot a television. 
[01:43:30]  They still did it, though.  It's very heavy.  Now one guy's got like a fucking 60-inch television.  Under his arm.  He's carrying it with that handle that's on top of the box.  In the old days, it's like a fucking giant TV.  It's five feet deep.  You had a big, heavy tube.  You had to break into the hardware store to get the wheelbarrow to get the TV.  Yeah, to get the TV.  Yeah.  It was complicated back then.  You said that handle.  The handle you read. 
[01:44:00]  You know that handle, that crazy thing on top?  That wacky handle.  The blackout, that was like a snow day for adults.  Everyone was excited because they didn't have to go to work, so they started boozing.  The economy didn't melt down, and all of a sudden, bread was 200 bucks a loaf.  All right.  All right, well.  Yeah.  Oh, Jesus, Joe.  I've been here since 2002, history of New York.  They ought to give you a little TV series on the Yes Network.  I don't think that will ever happen with Joe DeRosa. 
[01:44:30]  We all laugh, but you know what?  That's kind of a good idea.  It's great to see New York through the eyes of a newbie like Joe DeRosa.  Oh, a newbie.  You're a newbie.  Get out of here.  Get out of here.  I'm going to say the same thing when you come to Philly.  Well, yeah, I don't know shit about Philly.  That's what I'm trying to say.  Yeah, you're a Philly newbie.  You go there a lot.  I've been going there for the last seven years.  I don't know shit about Philly.  But I've seen you.  You come down.  You talk about the cheese steaks and the Liberty Bell all the time to everybody.  Oh, yeah. 
[01:45:00]  Do I?  I think you know what you're talking about.  Let it be known.  The Rocky Stairs.  All right.  I've done the Rocky Stairs, but I have not done the Liberty Bell yet.  Okay?  I have done the...  That's because you're a newbie.  Well, I was part of a wedding where they decided they wanted their pictures taken at the top of the stairs.  Ah, just like a bunch of rookies.  Are you really going to let Joe flip it around like this as if people move from Manhattan down to Philly?  Bill, what are you doing?  I got a leg up for a second there.  He's undermining you, man. 
[01:45:30]  Don't expose it.  He's undermining you.  I don't know anything about Harrisburg, Virginia.  Do you go to the Empire State Building, Joe?  Never.  Because that's tourist shit.  You don't do tourist shit, right?  Dude, I've been here for eight years.  I've lived in Harlem already.  I lived in Queens.  I lived in Midtown.  Joe, you didn't live in Harlem.  I did.  137 in Broadway.  Yeah, but by the time you got there, it wasn't Harlem anymore.  137.  The fact that you were there, Joe, and never took it cinderblocked to the face, that wasn't Harlem. 
[01:46:00]  Cinderblocked to the face.  I think 137 in Broadway is not that bad.  Just because there was a few Danish shops that opened up doesn't mean that there weren't still crack dealers in the neighborhood.  It was one of those...  It was half-gentrified.  What's about gritty 2002 New York?  What was it like during those post-Giuliani years?  Gritty?  It wasn't pretty.  It wasn't pretty.  Sometimes you had to walk three blocks to get a bottle of water.  You need that taxi driver look.  Exactly. 
[01:46:30]  That look from taxi driver.  We lived through that, Joe.  The opening credits to the odd couple, like that gritty New York.  Should we show you the odd couple?  We've got to show you the odd couple open.  With the buses that were just spewing black smoke.  You only know Times Square is a nice, fun fucking place to get a bite to eat.  I remember when I first started driving down to New York City to do spots and driving down  right when you got to the Bronx, so there were those burned-out cars just sitting on the side of the road. 
[01:47:00]  Yeah.  Those things were scary during the day.  I just remember thinking, like, what sort of Armageddon is going on down here that they can't remove that stuff?  Yeah, they had burnt-out cars on the side of the road, Joe.  And remember the buildings on the Cross-Bronx Expressway?  Ants certainly will.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  Where it was all boarded up, and then they decided to try to make the buildings better by painting, like, flower pots and stuff  where the windows would have been if they didn't have the fucking plywood up.  Yeah, they tried to make them better. 
[01:47:30]  But they fixed up all those buildings now.  People are now living in them again, but used to drive through there.  I mean, those were all abandoned buildings.  My aunt used to live in the Bronx, so I remember coming up in the 80s and seeing, like, the burnout cars  and just being, like, what, you know, it looked like a bomb went off.  Yeah, like, what's going on?  Was that when you came up for the Thanksgiving Day Parade?  No, no.  You tourist?  No, we came up to see my...  Did you get a good spot outside Macy's?  Came up to see my aunt with dementia, who was dying, but make jokes about it. 
[01:48:00]  You did used to see stripped cars everywhere.  Not anymore.  You don't see them anymore.  I know where that fucking button is.  Don't challenge me, asshole.  That was such an obnoxious fucking sound effect.  Yeah.  Cars up on blocks and shit, and the hood gone, the engine gone, wires ripped out, and then  it would sit there for, like, months.  All right, chill out, man. 
[01:48:30]  My family might have ditched a car or two over the years.  Yeah.  Not anymore now.  No.  My dad...  I think my dad dumped a car on the cross Bronx once.  That was, like, a good dumping ground.  I've told a story, Bill Burr.  My dad would get rid of cars like you get rid of the family pet after he dies.  Just dump it?  Well, no, you leave, you know, and the kids don't know that the dog actually died, and  then the father comes back with some story, how it ran away, or he had to give it to a  farm or something. 
[01:49:00]  But he would do that with our family cars.  He would leave.  He would get a friend, and two cars would leave the driveway, and only one would come  back.  Yeah, what would you do with a car back then?  You just would dump it.  My dad got lazy, though.  Remember where I used to live in Centiport?  Yeah.  Top of the hill.  It's now a medical building.  He dumped one of the cars there.  It was a mere mile and a half from the house.  And my little brothers were growing up embarrassed, because their friends would go, isn't that  your family car, like, abandoned in this parking lot? 
[01:49:30]  That's funny, man.  But he used to take it into the Bronx and all that shit.  Yeah.  It was expensive to get rid of a car.  Take it up by the...  Yeah.  They're animals anyway.  Let them lose their souls.  What's that?  Godfather.  Nice.  Bill Burr.  Yes.  Yes.  Sorry, Bill.  I want to get to the big announcement.  That Bill has, which is really amazing.  My big announcement is I'm reactivating my MySpace page. 
[01:50:00]  Yes.  Finally.  This is...  My big announcement is I am going to be performing at Carnegie Hall on November 11th.  That is Carnegie Hall.  Unbelievable.  That's pretty goddamn big.  Dude, congratulations, Carnegie.  We'll get back to beating you up, but before we do that,  we've got to congratulate you.  That's unbelievable.  It's awesome.  Yeah, it's pretty overwhelming.  I've actually been trying to block it out that that's actually going to happen. 
[01:50:30]  Are you freaked out?  Well, yeah.  I keep, you know, thinking about it and kind of thinking like,  well, where do you go from there?  Or you'll just randomly see something about somebody and they perform there and it freaks you out.  Yeah.  But, yeah, I'm excited.  I'm going to be doing the show with Paul Verzi and Joe DeRosa,  the teen idol sensation from your wonderful program. 
[01:51:00]  Joe DeRosa, too.  Wow.  Right in coattails in the Carnegie Hall.  Right?  Look at you.  That's awesome, though, man.  Shit.  You can put that on your resume, Joe.  It's going to be fun.  Now, Opie, will you be able to make this show or is 9.30 going to be too late?  It's a 7.30 show.  Oh, damn.  Oh, damn.  Well, Joe DeRosa invited me to his birthday celebration,  but it started at 9.30, which is a little late for me these days.  So now he's holding.  No, it's actually at 7.30, Opie.  Yeah, I know.  That's what I said.  And tickets go on sale at.  Monday. 
[01:51:30]  On Monday, August 15th.  There, I got it all up.  Uh, tickets, uh, go to nycomedyfestival.com, it looks like, for tickets.  That's right.  Also, uh, available through Carnegie Charge.  I don't know what that is.  I guess the number is 212-247-7800 or the Carnegie Hall website,  which is carnegiehall.org.  Boy.  That's awesome, Burr.  Congrats again.  How do you get to Carnegie Hall?  A lot of hard work and dedication, Ant. 
[01:52:00]  Perseverance.  These kids don't have it these days.  That old guy.  Now, Joe, as a full-time New York tourist,  is it weird that you're going to be actually performing on the Carnegie Hall stage?  You know, it is.  Because when I saw the, uh, the revival of Gypsy there when I was 12.  Oh, wow.  I always had dreams of stepping on that stage.  Are you going to take the double-decker tour bus past Carnegie Hall first  and learn about it from the guy with the fucking bullhorn?  I guess Joe's going to show up in a tux that night and act like he's headlining. 
[01:52:30]  Are you going to go to the Carnegie Deli afterwards, you tourist?  Oh, yeah.  Get one of those big sandwiches.  I'll have the Joe DeRosa.  We don't have a sandwich named that, sir.  Well, you goddamn should.  I hate those sandwiches.  Joe's going to be doing what Joe's going to do, what he always does.  He's going to hang in the lobby like he's out in front of the cellar  trying to pick up some drunk whore as she walks out.  That's exactly what I'm doing. 
[01:53:00]  Wow, he just blew up your spot, Joe.  Damn.  I'm going to try to bang a classy theater-going gal that night.  Yes.  All the drunk whores that are listening to us thinking that Joe will actually  like them.  Yeah, that's going to be awkward for you, Joe.  Yeah.  Exactly.  A little fucking handbag.  I'm into it.  Yeah, I carry one of those little dogs.  She's got her theater fan with her.  Yes, and opera glasses, right?  Those opera glasses, yeah.  I believe that's Joe DeRosa on stage. 
[01:53:30]  Joe's goal that night is to bang a socialite.  A debutante.  Hey, Bill, you know our audience is a bunch of assholes,  but they're all like breaking character going,  holy shit, this is awesome.  They're really excited, man.  Yeah, that's very cool.  Goddamn.  Yeah, I can't.  I'm not going to lie to you.  I can't believe it.  Yeah.  I can't believe it.  So hopefully I'm on my game that night.  Yeah.  I've tuned in. 
[01:54:00]  I've tuned in to a couple of your specials there.  You know, they're available on Netflix.  And really fucking great, man.  You just, you come leaps and bounds from the old days when, you know,  we used to say you were good, but.  Oh, thank you.  I'm teasing, of course, Bill.  His new hour, too, is his best.  If you don't mind me saying, Bill, I think it's your best hour.  Not at all, Joe.  Not the one, you know, I don't mean your new hour like your last special. 
[01:54:30]  I mean the new hour you're doing on stage, I think, is your best.  I don't know how you keep doing that.  You keep coming out with a new hour every other year.  It's easy, Joe.  I keep failing in my personal life.  It really fuels the act.  If you didn't spend so much time on tour buses, Joe DeRosa.  I'm not going to let this one go.  Blow off a ferry to the Statue of Liberty and maybe you can write some material.  Oh, Jesus. 
[01:55:00]  Oh, God.  Don't bring the material into it, Oaf.  Oh, no, you know, we don't do that.  Joe DeRosa is absolutely hilarious.  No, I'm kidding.  No, you're right, though, because then the listeners get all confused.  Why would I ever see him?  The boy said he sucks.  Joe DeRosa does not suck.  Bill Burr does not suck.  And believe it or not, Rich Voss does not suck.  No.  They're all great on stage.  You're right.  You're absolutely right.  With what you just said there, Joe.  Thank you, Oaf.  Burr's going to blow the lid off of Carnegie Hall.  It's going to be unfun.  I'm fucking so happy for a friend. 
[01:55:30]  You know how much it takes for a comic to be genuinely happy for another comic?  A lot.  And I am genuinely happy for Bill.  It's awesome.  Because you're part of the bill.  Yeah, because you're on.  That's got nothing to do.  You make a fair point, but let's not.  I tell you, you're getting soft on me.  Bill, fire him right now so I can see if he's really happy for you.  Oh, my God.  I can't imagine what he'd write on his Twitter account and his 2,000 followers.  Oh, shit. 
[01:56:00]  That would be a PR nightmare.  Come on, Joe.  Let's get back to trashing each other.  All right.  All right.  It's so goddamn nice.  It's creeping me out.  All right.  Hey, how's L.A. treating you, Bill?  I actually love it out here, if you can believe it.  But I figured out the secret to living out here is what I didn't do the last time.  Last time when I lived out here, I tried to do New York stuff, like get a good slice of pizza at 4 in the morning.  And when I couldn't, I was like, this place sucks.  So you just do L.A. stuff when you're out here, you know? 
[01:56:30]  Cash it in by.  You go hiking.  You live your own little world.  And everything's over by 2 a.m.  Yeah, but you go out at 8.  I mean, I love how New Yorkers act like they go out at 8 p.m. and drink until 5 in the morning.  No, it's pretty much 11.  You're out by 10 or 11 here in New York.  And then you're out until 4 in the morning.  Unless you have that powdered five-hour energy.  Then you can go out at 7, 7 a.m. 
[01:57:00]  Yes.  The only reason I like the 4 a.m. cutoff in New York is because of comedy.  Like, it's because on Fridays and Saturdays, you're getting done it sometimes as late as like 2 a.m.  And it's nice to be able to go somewhere for a couple hours to unwind.  Yeah, not just walk through a ghost town to go home.  Yeah, and sit on your lonely couch.  Oh, God.  Drink by yourself.  You got a lonely couch, Joe?  The loneliest.  I got the loneliest couch in town.  Why is it so lonely?  It's just, you know, it's a one-bedroom apartment with a single man. 
[01:57:30]  It's, you know, if you're not bringing back a...  It's just on his DVD.  It's very lonely, you know?  You know?  Yeah, so that's...  Well, Bill, we miss you.  Well, I miss you too, Opie.  We miss you, though.  We miss doing radio with Mr. Burr.  But Carnegie Hall, Friday, November 11th.  Yes.  Get that on the calendar, people. 
[01:58:00]  Tickets on sale Monday, August 15th at 10 a.m.  That's Eastern time.  And I believe...  Listen, I'm coming in town, what is it, November 21st?  That's a Sunday, and I'll be there in New York the 22nd, 23rd, 24th.  I'm doing the Stress Factory.  I do Nashville the week before, so I figure what's the point of flying all the way back west?  I'll just come straight to New York.  Oh, good.  And so if you guys will have me, I'll definitely drop by as much as you'll let me. 
[01:58:30]  Of course.  Dude, you're one of the few that gets the open door.  You know that.  Hey, I've been talking to...  I almost got my girl talked into letting me get a pistol.  Oh, yeah?  We got to talk about that, yeah.  It's a lot of fun.  Just blast away.  I can't see Bill Burr with a pistol.  Why?  It'd be fun.  I think he would shoot somebody.  Nah.  Bill, would you shoot somebody?  No, no.  It all depends on the situation. 
[01:59:00]  If they're coming into my house and they steal my Cheerios after the dollar collapse, I'd definitely...  No, we all...  You know what's great?  There's so many fat people in this country, so usually you've got to go with the shotgun as  your first one just so you can get in the general area, but with all these fatties, I think  it's pretty easy.  Now, Bill would be good with a pistol.  Bill's like a collected and poised guy.  He's got his things that'll set him off and make him fly off the handle, but he's very  poised. 
[01:59:30]  He's the kind of guy that, as he was teaching you to shoot, he'd be talking to you about  respect the gun and all that stuff.  He's a sensible enough guy.  Yeah, seriously.  Throughout the years, through some of his insane rants, I'd see that he is a sane guy.  They're all coming true right now, by the way.  Yes, they are.  They are.  You know, hey.  Even a broken clock.  What'd you say?  You heard me.  I didn't get a broken clock. 
[02:00:00]  I don't know what that is.  See, I didn't do the second part.  The cliche, even a broken clock is right twice a day.  Twice a day.  Oh, Jesus.  What, are you getting a highbrow on me?  Never.  My roommate in college told me he made that up.  Stop it.  I swear to God, I believed him.  I never heard it before.  He goes, I thought of a great cliche today.  You know, I was looking at the clock.  Yeah, I swear to God, the clock on our oven was broken.  What's his name?  James Cargill.  But the funny thing is, maybe he did. 
[02:00:30]  No one had to come up with it.  I think it's an older saying than your roommate.  Fair enough, sir.  I don't think he wasn't.  I was reading a magazine the other day, and there was a bunch of rappers talking, and  they were talking about women.  And one of them said, you show me a beautiful woman, and I'll show you a guy that's tired  of fucking her.  And then another guy said, yo, that's hot.  And I'm like, that's like a cliche at this point.  How have you never heard that expression?  Yeah.  He gave the other guy credit as if that was his observation. 
[02:01:00]  Dummies.  All right.  Stinch in time, 69.  Oh, Billy.  Well, get your ass back to New York.  Get on the show.  And we'll discuss some firearms.  Absolutely.  All right, gentlemen.  Thank you for having me.  And Joe, it's always nice to talk to a gritty New Yorker like yourself.  I'll see you soon. 
[02:01:30]  All right, Bill Burr.  See you, Bill.  The big announcement, Carnegie Hall, November 11th.  And I've just been told we're going to have front row tickets to give away in the coming  weeks or maybe a month.  That's good.  Tickets go on sale Monday.  I think this thing sells out for you, Bill, if you're still there.  So I would suggest people get on the phone immediately on Monday.  All right, Bill.  Thank you.  All right, guys.  Thank you, man.  Bill Burr, everyone.  I would like to chat with Bill about firearms.  Bill likes it.  Bill's always been into, like, guns and pistols. 
[02:02:00]  He's been like, hey, always ask me questions.  What is that?  What kind of gun do you think that is a good job?  Oh, dude, yeah.  He loves it.  And if you looked in Bill's head, like, for what he sees the future as, it would be Red  Dawn just playing on a repeat.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Like, I'm not surprised he wants a gun.  He just guns, gold, and, you know, some food.  Yeah, Bill can take it back to the fucking Old West.  Yeah.  He'd do it.  Let's go to the Odd Couple TV show opening theme for Bill. 
[02:02:30]  Oh, yeah, yeah.  For Joe DeRose.  I've seen this.  He picks up the cigar with the umbrella.  No, no, no, no.  No, it's just that gritty New York.  This is from 1970.  This is 1970.  You got, look at there.  There's a hooker walking in front of Oscar Madison.  Look how dirty the people look.  Everyone.  Look how out of shape they are.  Strip clubs on the street.  What happened to his shoes?  He stepped in wet cement. 
[02:03:00]  Oh.  That used to happen.  Man, that must have been tough back then.  Look at the.  That's Times Square, believe it or not.  I know.  But look how shitty it looks.  It doesn't look that different.  I mean, I know it was shittier, but I mean, this isn't a great example, guys.  You know what?  You're right, Joe.  Show me the warriors, you know?  I mean, that's, you know.  You've been right a lot today, Joe.  And I don't like it.  This is a bust right here.  You're right.  That one wasn't as good.  I think there was a different beginning.  The movie, The Odd Couple, makes New York look way grittier than that. 
[02:03:30]  Yeah.  When he's going to the go-go bars in the beginning, when he's going to kill himself.  The go-go bars.  Yeah.  Remember when he goes to that hotel to commit suicide?  There's that fucking greasy, fat fuck-eating pizza.  Five dollars, please.  You know, those fucking joints.  Yeah.  Yeah, they start popping up around 2003, I believe.  The good old days.  The good old days.  Yeah.  Look, I never said I was a tried and true New Yorker, but I'll tell you this.  I love this place.  It's my favorite place I ever lived.  Nothing against Philly.  I love Philly.  Where do you live in Philly?  I was born in northeast Philly. 
[02:04:00]  I grew up, I'm not going to lie, I grew up in the suburbs, but I spent a lot of time,  physical time in Philly because of, especially after I started doing comedy, it was like,  I was down there every other fucking night.  To the big city.  My whole family lived in Philly, and it was, you know, I was down there a lot, but I would  live in Philly.  If my career got to the point where I didn't have to be in New York and run out to auditions  and do all the dumb shit you got to do, I would live in Philly. 
[02:04:30]  There's parts of Philly that I like a lot.  Rittenhouse Square is fucking beautiful.  That's about where I hang out, usually.  Yeah.  And then if you step one block off of it, you get immediately shot in the face.  Yeah, you've got to be really careful.  I'd live anywhere but fucking New York if I didn't have to work in New York.  It's the worst.  And I don't mean Jersey either.  Fuck that.  But you don't live.  You live.  Yeah, but I'm just talking about tax-wise and the bullshit traffic and all that stuff. 
[02:05:00]  To get a nice giant chunk of property in Pennsylvania, not Philly, I would go more fucking, you know, rural.  This is my dream and I'm starting, or one of my dreams, I'm starting to look into it now to see how I can orchestrate this financially at some point.  I want to buy, excuse me, I grew up for all intents and purposes in King of Prussia, Pennsylvania.  That's the most prominent part of the area I grew up in.  There is, there's this whole section out there where it's, if you get into the surrounding towns, there are farm, not farm answer is even too big of a word or whatever. 
[02:05:30]  But they're farmhouses, old houses made out of stone and whatever, with like, you know, maybe two acres of land around it, big backyard, trees surrounding the property.  Some of them have little barns out back or whatever.  I want to buy one of those, make it as private as I can between the trees and putting some hedges and shit up in the front yard, and have it as like my escape so I can go home, have all my boys from back home over, my family, have bonfires in the back. 
[02:06:00]  Yeah, and not worry about paying any ass neighbors or anything.  You want to be Amish.  Amish, except I'm allowed to go to the Wawa if I need to.  Build some wood-burning stoves, sell them to the public.  Yes.  I saw some Amish.  Work with my hands.  Yeah.  Barn raisings.  That's going to be great.  I had a farmer's market in Rittenhouse Square this past weekend.  I was down there, and the Amish were there. 
[02:06:30]  They just look like weirdos.  Yeah, they're fucking weirdos.  And then I feel bad for their kids because they're being brought up in this community, and they don't even realize what they could be doing with this.  I do.  They had the straw hats on and stuff.  I do have a fantasy of banging a hot Amish.  Do you know what her pussy would smell like?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Tell us more, Joe.  Yeah.  Do you know the-  After churning butter, you know what her calloused hands on your cock would feel like from that splintered butter churn? 
[02:07:00]  Oh, God.  Her pussy would smell like-  Slow down, Joe.  Just slow down.  Why?  It would smell like what?  That'd be great, though.  Taking that bonnet off.  The first thing that comes off is that bonnet.  Oh, yeah.  Remember in-  This is how bad her pussy would be.  And you know it would be a big hairy bush.  Remember in Indiana Jones' Last Crusade?  Yeah.  Remember at the end when he's got to go through the-  There'll be three-leaf trials, so cunning, whatever. 
[02:07:30]  Yeah.  And then when he's got to go through the first one, only the penitent man will pass.  And Sean Connery's going, penitent, only the penitent man, only the penitent man.  And he's whispering it to himself as he has to kneel or whatever.  Me and my friend used to say, like, that would be like if you got, like, a really bad-smelling pussy, like, right in your face, but you had to eat it out.  And you'd just be sitting there going, penitent, only the penitent man, the penitent man, the penitent man, the penitent man, the penitent man, the penitent man, the penitent man, the penitent man, the penitent man, the penitent man.  I'm going around a little bit in a wide circle here, but that's how bad her pussy would smell. 
[02:08:00]  You would have to say that to yourself to get through it.  Dude, it would-  They've never-  What, they don't bathe?  Come on.  They bathe, dude, but you got to do more than bathe to make a pussy not stink.  Yeah, like what?  Like what, man?  Just clean it.  Jumping caps.  Healthy ones are self-cleaning, by the way.  They're like a self-cleaning stove.  The healthy ones.  You know.  They get up to the same temperatures.  And you do have to wipe them off with a little fantastic every now and then, but, yeah, but as long as they're keeping it clean, they're taking a washcloth to it, you don't have to stick something up there and constantly be fucking checking the pH like a pool. 
[02:08:30]  Can we Google image Amish broads?  I'm going to see if we can find a good one.  And I'm talking about, you know, of course, one of the virginal ones.  Well, because your fantasy, you think you're going to bang the chick from Witness, and that's not what it's going to be like.  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, something like that.  No, it wouldn't be.  No, dude.  You're going to take down her pants, and it's going to look like fucking Orson Welles when he had the beard. 
[02:09:00]  We were served a wine before it's time.  Just all skin and fucking hair.  Yeah, there's a lucker right there.  Oh, Christ.  I don't know.  Her pussy could start that fire without a match.  Amber's web log.  I don't know.  It's just something about a hot, you know, get a hot Amish girl in that fucking dumb outfit.  Are they in, Brent?  And then just fucking, it would take you an hour to undress her with all those fucking clothes, those big fucking lace-up witch shoes that go to their knees. 
[02:09:30]  How many layers do you think you've got to get through to get to the pussy?  Oh, fuck.  There's got to be eight layers of clothes.  Now you're exaggerating.  How many layers do you think?  A fucking one of those dumb things that go underneath the dress to make the dress so you can't see under it.  They'd spend 20 minutes in the buckles alone.  Yeah, a lot of buckles.  Oh, God, dude.  They're just fucking, they're pilgrim outfits. 
[02:10:00]  Ugh, the worst.  Sam, is there a hot Amish chick on there somewhere?  We tried.  This is the hottest one we can find right now.  What's like a fake one?  That's Sam searching, too.  If Danny was searching.  She looked hot.  Yeah, just put in Amish nudes.  No, no, go up.  Up.  No, not up.  You piece of shit.  She's selling plums.  Oh, my God.  No, get rid of her.  Go.  No, up.  No, you suck.  God, you suck.  Look at that fucking inbred.  Look at their faces. 
[02:10:30]  Look at their children of the corn faces that they have.  Look at her face.  Can you blow that up?  Yeah, blow it up.  Come on.  Let's see this shit.  The Amish quilter is the name of the website.  Jesus Christ.  That sounds like a thing you do when you're fucking a chick.  Did you give her an Amish quilter?  Tens of hits.  Oh, God.  They really are nasty.  Look at that chick.  They look like Romanian.  She's got the one on the right is midget face, and she's normal size.  She does.  We got some intel coming. 
[02:11:00]  The other one looks like Jay Moore.  She looks like Jay Moore in an Amish outfit.  They all look like Jay Moore.  It's a community of Jay Moors.  She does.  It looks like Jay Moore.  She's doing a Christopher Walken impression right now for the other one.  Where's my bonnet?  Jay Moore is Amish.  Let's say hi to Matt in Minnesota.  Matt.  Matt.  Hey, guys.  The Amish, to keep that inbreeding now, put out personal ads to get different people's  bloodlines, and they pay you to pretty much have sex with their daughters. 
[02:11:30]  Oh, yeah?  That's like Waterworld.  The guy comes in there.  Remember?  My buddy got paid $700 to sleep with an Amish broad down there, and pretty much the mother  stood there the whole entire time and watched it.  I'd do that in a second.  What did he say her pussy smelled like?  Is that chick Amish right there on the left?  No way.  He said the house smelled in general.  The house smelled?  Oh, God.  The house probably...  The pussy smells so bad that the whole house thinks... 
[02:12:00]  Wow.  That's what I'm saying.  You don't realize what it's like to not ever use Lysol until you never use it.  Really?  It's like, that's what always kills me.  I'm like...  You tell you for granted?  Yeah, you watch like Deadwood, and you know, Ian McShane's pulling a chick's pants down.  It's like, dude, don't act like the waft of stench just didn't knock you back across  the fucking room.  It stinks.  Probably so used to it.  It probably was just the standard, like, so it didn't bother them.  It's...  Can I just say something to the women of the audience? 
[02:12:30]  And I don't mean this disrespectfully.  Of course not.  I really don't.  I love women.  I love them.  I love having sex with them and all that.  Your pussies are disgusting.  Okay?  Wow.  Joe, what's wrong with you?  I'm just kidding.  I just wanted to...  Another person saying they bust the Amish out so they can fuck out a family.  Yeah?  I guess this is almost happening in the community.  Well, how come I've never seen any Amish chicks that wanted some kind of shit?  Huh?  Yeah. 
[02:13:00]  They used to come down the Mennonites.  When I went to Kutztown U in Pennsylvania and we were right next to the Mennonites where  the Mennonites lived.  It was right near...  Kingpin.  The movie Kingpin?  Mm-hmm.  That was Scranton, Pennsylvania.  That was like an hour from us.  It was all Amish and Mennonites.  Yeah.  The Mennonites would come down sometimes and hang out with us and shit.  And they would go fucking batshit, dude.  They would go batshit.  Because they get this, like, leave.  They get to do, like, some sort of...  Yeah, they get that part of their life where they're able to just not be Amish for a while.  I think it's called Rum Spring. 
[02:13:30]  It's called Amok Time.  Rum Spring.  It's every seven years.  Yeah, it's like a shitty version of coming to America.  Vulcan and Breed.  Yeah.  That's when they decide if they're going to go all in with the whole Amish thing, I think.  To pring is in charge of that.  They go nuts, though.  Yeah, they allow them to go nuts for what?  Yeah.  A week or something?  A long weekend?  I don't know.  What?  Oh, right.  What's that?  What's...  That was when Spock had to go back to Vulcan to Breed because he was freaking out. 
[02:14:00]  He got all horny.  And then he wound up getting in the fight with Kirk because she picked Kirk as her, the other guy.  So they had to fight.  This is a fight to the death.  Oh, wow.  And then Bones, of course, shot Kirk up with some shit that made him look dead, but he  really wasn't dead.  Spock thought he had killed him.  Is that the one where it's like, you've pitted us against each other?  Fools.  That one.  The famous.  Oh, that's probably 15 episodes.  No, but that's the song.  Dan it, dan it.  Dan it, dan it, dan it, dan it. 
[02:14:30]  Yeah, yeah.  They did a take off on it on Cable Guy.  On Cable Guy.  Yeah, yeah.  That's my favorite part of the movie when he's doing it.  It really is hilarious.  Dan it, dan it, dan it.  He did such a great imitation of that.  They also use those weapons, I think, in the Gamesters of Triskelion.  Jesus Christ.  Oh, I am a complete Star Trek original series geek and movie geek. 
[02:15:00]  Whoa.  What's going on there?  Oh, see, this glass should be one way, so we don't look so perverted looking.  I think it's bring your daughter to work day or something.  All right.  Is that what's going on soon?  No, she looks a little older than that.  Daughters can be a little older.  Did you see the fucking disgusting, creepy look?  You didn't see it because he's got his head turned.  He literally goes, oh, she looks a little older than that.  That girl's maybe 15 times.  No, stop it. 
[02:15:30]  Sam, ask her.  Oh, my God.  Maybe we shouldn't ask.  I don't know who that guy is.  Let's say hi to Jerry in Virginia.  Jerry.  Stop.  It's creepy looking.  You're not seeing it.  He's biting his lower lip.  He literally looks like he should be smelling panties right now.  She looks homish.  Her bone structure isn't fully developed yet.  No, that's fucking perfect.  Oh, my God.  I like soft bones.  They can't break. 
[02:16:00]  She's not 15.  Sam's coming back in.  I'm going to ask him how old he thinks she is.  I bet you he doesn't say over 15.  They're telling them about.  Hold on, Jerry.  All right.  Yeah, no problem.  Oh, he's talking a little.  You don't like.  Well, Sam, stop to talk.  What do you got for the show?  Look at the little shorts she's wearing.  You don't like that at all?  She's like 18.  She's fucking 18.  The only reason I give her that much is she's wearing the shirt where you can see the bra.  Yeah.  The young girls are dressing slutty. 
[02:16:30]  She's 18.  Come on.  They're really just pigs from a young age these days.  It's a shame, man.  Sam.  What's a shame?  My question is very simple.  How old do you think that girl is that aunt was biting his lower lip over?  No, I had a little piece of skin hanging.  I believe under 20.  Oh, that doesn't help.  I can't say with certainty that she's.  Does she look like she could be 15?  She could be.  No.  That's not what she is saying.  You guys are out of your minds.  I guess the guy is definitely her dad. 
[02:17:00]  And he's 32 years old.  Well, go ask him.  How old are you?  Yeah.  No.  Can't they?  Can't ask them.  No.  Oh, is that bad?  Go.  Are you taking a day off from school?  Yeah.  Oh, it's summer.  They'd be like, HR.  Plus, I just said hello to them and then walked in here.  So, for me to go back out and say, by the way, how old are you would be somewhat transparent.  Joe, how old do you think she is?  Sam didn't help at all.  The only reason I'm giving her 18 is because of the see-through shirt with the bra.  If it wasn't for that, I would have said 17, 16. 
[02:17:30]  What about Mars?  She's definitely not 16.  I might say 17, which is completely legal in New York.  Mars is marching down the hall to ask her.  Definitely.  You're like a defense attorney that just finds the fucking loopholes.  Wait a minute.  Why definitely not 16?  Because she didn't look 16.  She was 15.  There was a little bit more age to see.  Yeah.  Did you ever see Raging Bull?  She didn't look 14 in that movie.  Yeah, well, she was fucking 30 or something in that movie. 
[02:18:00]  In real life.  Jesus Christ.  What's up?  Mars is coming in.  What?  People are thinking teenager.  Yeah, well, that could mean 17, 18.  In your honest opinion, how old is that girl?  I already know the answer to that question.  I asked the father.  All right, hold on a minute.  How did you ask the father?  You don't give a fuck.  Excuse me, how old is your daughter?  Mars don't give a shit.  And he told me.  All right, hold on, hold on.  This is the deal.  I think 15.  He thinks 18.  18.  Joe?  15? 
[02:18:30]  Joe?  18.  I'm sticking with 18.  I'll say 17.  No, you're out, Sam.  No, I'm not out.  I saw her.  You did under 20.  That messed up everything.  It didn't mess up anything.  I'm saying 18.  I'm saying 15.  Mars, how old?  Hope he gets a bell.  I know this shit.  15.  She was 15.  I know this shit.  How do you let your daughter dress like that at 15?  That's a disgrace.  You bit your lower lip over a 15-year-old.  You fucking soul. 
[02:19:00]  You know what?  You people are hypocrites, all you fucking guys.  I'm not.  No fuck yourself.  And by the way, I'll preface this by saying anybody can come over and look at any computer  I have in my house.  You'll never see anything inappropriate.  I want to preface it by saying that.  Smash cut.  But let me tell you something.  I know what you're going to say.  She absolutely looked too young.  I'm being honest.  That's what I'm going to say.  No.  I'm saying that any guy would look at that and go, yeah, that's hot.  Stop.  Mars.  It's only your fucking. 
[02:19:30]  Mars is shaking his head.  It's only this fake fucking morality that people pour on so they don't look like perverts.  Be honest for a second.  Look at her and think how supple that ass would be.  I honestly don't think she was hot.  Stop it.  I'll be honest.  I really don't.  You sound fucking dishonest.  You're using the same.  You sound like Hitler.  Thank you.  Wow.  Why would you compliment me?  Take that as a compliment.  We had him.  We had him up against the wrong.  We had to compliment him with that.  No, listen.  Look, I'm not a hypocrite.  I've been in here frequently talking about how 60-year-old women turn me on if they're hot enough. 
[02:20:00]  So, you know, I'm not.  Well, that's true.  She looked young, Ann.  And if we had to all guess how old she is.  She didn't look like a woman.  What?  She didn't look like a woman.  Well, she was in between that girl-woman thing.  There's nothing wrong with that.  She's still got her hymen, but she's always a woman to me.  What, are you, John Valvey all of a sudden?  John Valvey.  Yeah.  Is he a nice guy?  Um, yeah.  He's a weirdo.  We like him. 
[02:20:30]  He's a raging alcoholic.  Usually when he comes around, he, like, sleeps until he goes on the show.  Right.  Yeah, I see you guys.  You just don't want to be honest.  You got a good point.  I thought she was 18.  Yeah.  So.  So.  And, and you don't, and you're like, how do they let her dress like that?  So what you're saying is, you thought that was, that was sexy and attractive on her,  those shorts.  No, what I was saying was, the only reason I said she was 18, I was like, I don't think 
[02:21:00]  she's 18.  The only reason I'm guessing she's 18 is because she's wearing a shirt that's so transparent  you could see her bra.  Okay.  I'm like, no 15-year-old girl should dress like that.  When she walked by, did you find her attractive?  Uh, I thought she looked a little young.  But did you find her attractive?  Listen, no.  Here's the thing.  On this one, no.  I looked at her and said to myself.  Well, you two like old bags anyway.  I said, that's a girl that is.  Oh! 
[02:21:30]  Her bones look like they weren't developed yet.  Oh, stop.  What are you?  You got x-ray vision?  You know whose bone was developed?  Antony's.  She looks like she's still going to the pediatrician.  Oh, well.  She looks like she still takes sucretes when she has a sore throat.  Sucretes!  All right, Joe, where are you going to be?  We're going to take a break here.  God, you people.  I'll be all around New York City for the rest of August, so check my website for that, 
[02:22:00]  JoeDeRosaComedy.com.  But then in September, I'm doing a tour of the Southeastern United States.  Atlanta, Athens, Georgia, North Carolina, Tuscaloosa, Alabama.  A bunch of cool little rooms.  So check me out on that, please.  We got another shot at this.  She's coming down the hall.  Let's not make this look obvious.  I'm going to be honest with you.  I'm going to be honest with you.  Now we get a full frontal face shot.  I'm going to drink.  I'm actually going to make it look like I'm doing something.  Like I'm discussing this with Joe.  I'm going to go that there were certain cups or something that I'm doing. 
[02:22:30]  I'm just babbling.  Come on.  That's fucking.  And there's nothing wrong with that.  No, she looks fit.  You're out of your mind.  She looks a little young.  Well, that's just a youthful look.  There are girls that are 18, 20 years old that look very young.  You ever see the decoys they use on To Catch a Predator?  Did we get dumped out of?  Someone's saying?  No.  Probably during Joe's plug.  Maybe.  No one's dumping anything.  She looked a little young. 
[02:23:00]  A little bit.  There's nothing wrong with youthful, like, look.  What?  What?  Oh, she didn't have fucking hangy tits?  You're justifying right now.  You sound like when Bobby Kelly justifies eating a whole pizza right now.  Dude, it was wheat pizza.  And there's nothing wrong with wheat and cheese.  It's the same kind of thing, dude.  Just tap out of it.  Can I ask you a minute, this?  If there were no laws, then be honest. 
[02:23:30]  Don't be shocking because we're shock jocks.  Remember, we're shock jocks.  It's not going to be shocking.  How young would you go if there were no laws?  No laws, but there can also be no moral issues or psychological repercussions or all that shit.  Because that all comes into consideration.  Fair enough.  All right?  So you're talking basic numbers.  That means you're going.  That means you're going real low.  No, no.  If you're adding all that into the equation.  And whatever number I say, it does not include girls that do not develop as quickly as some other girls. 
[02:24:00]  And by the way.  But I would absolutely go 15.  Wow.  Jesus.  Because they look fine.  They look fine.  You know what?  Those tits are like snare drums.  They go boo, boo, boo, boo, boo, boo, boo, boo, boo, boo, boo, boo.  Look, Selena Gomez...  They don't need to be tuned. 
[02:24:30]  Look, Selena Gomez at 16 was all right.  See, look at you.  See?  That's what I mean.  I'm not dragging some fucking flat-chested, fucking not Philly-kneed girl to fucking out.  I'm talking about...  That girl...  Look at that.  That girl is...  She looks like a child.  What?  She looked like...  Whoever that is.  Oh, that's Selena.  That's Selena Gomez.  Christ, Opie.  Jesus, dude.  I'm not talking about when they...  That was her sweet 16 picture. 
[02:25:00]  And you are taking everything into consideration.  So, pop some fucking old bat up there that Joe thinks is hot.  Go ahead.  Pop an old fucking 65-year-old bat.  Not even Helen Mirren.  Yeah, yeah.  Look at Helen Mirren.  Yeah.  That's great.  Fuck that old bag of shit.  Look at her.  I would go there.  She's hot, man.  She's sucking it in.  She's wearing a bikini.  That holds her fucking saggy tits up.  Dude, she got gray pubic hairs, a prolapsed vagina. 
[02:25:30]  Fuck you.  I want that thing to be like one of those clams that you can't shuck.  That's how a vagina should be.  Not one with black fucking clam hanging out of it.  Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.  Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.  No.  Everyone wants us to tweet a picture.  We can't.  She's underage.  No, we can't do that.  No, we can't do that.  Couple things going on.  Jesus.  I struck a nerve over there.  Couple things.  You got to go to America's Got Talent.  I didn't watch, but everyone's saying that there's a... 
[02:26:00]  14-year-old on America's Got Talent.  You need to totally talk about the 14-year-old on America's Got Talent.  That dance.  What a piece of ass.  Ant would love.  Jesus Christ.  Is there any way to get...  You guys are misunderstanding me.  And this is what happens.  A few people talk about this girl from America's Got Talent, though.  And this is why I say people can't be honest, because I'm not talking about just cruising  the fucking junior highs and grabbing girls.  It's not what I'm talking about.  There are certain girls that are 15, 16-year-olds that are completely... have developed faster 
[02:26:30]  than their peers and look fucking fine.  They got big tits.  They're walking down the street and seeing a skirt and you look and go, wow, that's pretty  girl.  If I can come to your defense for one minute, you guys are misunderstanding Anthony, okay?  All he said was he would bang a 15-year-old if he was allowed to, okay?  So you guys stop misconstruing everything he's saying.  Someone's wondering if you're trying to get us fired. 
[02:27:00]  Are you trying to get us fired?  No!  Why would I do that?  I don't have my studio set up, so why don't you chill the fuck out a little bit?  See, now this is ridiculous.  No.  What?  This is the 14-year-old from America's Got Talent.  Yeah, she moves around, but she...  Now, she doesn't look cooked yet.  What about the one we didn't even really talk about?  Who was the 50-some-odd-year-old guy that just married the 16-year-old and it was all  over the news a couple weeks ago?  That was Percy from fucking Green Mile.  You see his drugged-out brother? 
[02:27:30]  Yeah, she looks like an old bat.  She looks like a fucking old prostitute.  And no one's commenting that she looks like she's on pills or drugs?  Yeah, she's a wreck.  And she's, what, 15 or 16 years old, I think?  She's supposed to be 16.  16?  Can you find a clip of hers?  That's being refuted.  Oh, really?  The family is 100% behind it.  Of course.  Nobody's got a problem with it.  They got that Percy money.  Well, how about the fucking Mormon guy?  Um, yeah.  What?  The Mormon guy.  The head of the Mormon church that's on trial right now because he impregnated a 15-year-old 
[02:28:00]  girl.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  No, no, I know.  Is this not relevant?  No, no, I know that.  Yeah, yeah.  I'm not even talking.  I'm just...  This chick.  Get the fuck out of here.  Well, that proves your point.  She's like a stripper.  There's no way you would look at that and go, she's 16.  No.  There's no fucking way you would.  The wedding picture, dude, she looks like she's 23.  Look at those weddings.  You got it?  She does not look anywhere near it.  There's no way she looks 16.  He also doesn't look anywhere near 52 or however fucking old he is. 
[02:28:30]  No, no, no, he doesn't.  But you got to get the video clip where she's talking because she's like pretty much trying  to eat her own mouth.  That marriage will last in the tens of months.  Did you see the interview?  No.  No.  I forgot who had it.  Are they fucked up?  I guess they would be fucked up.  She was trying to eat her own fucking mouth.  She looks like fucking in her late 20s, to tell you the truth.  Yeah.  What do you got?  I am so misunderstood.  Yeah, it's this one.  Courtship over the internet and say they fell in love without ever meeting each other in 
[02:29:00]  person.  I've never met her.  Watch your mouth.  And I'm telling you, it was a really beautiful and unique way to get to know someone because  we didn't have the distraction of...  Dead man walking here.  All the while, Courtney's mom, Krista, had been monitoring their exchanges and says she  was fully aware that Doug was so much older than her daughter.  And I said, if you and Alex have any misgivings whatsoever about this, if you are uncomfortable 
[02:29:30]  with it, I will respect you, and Courtney will respect you, and we will respect you.  She wants to fuck him right now.  She's like, why are you fucked?  What the fuck did you do?  Deeply Christian.  How deep?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Deeply.  I think he fucked a Christian right out of her.  Yeah.  Jesus Christ.  Yeah.  She's on ecstasy, someone's saying?  Adam Levine?  Adam, you're becoming a regular, man. 
[02:30:00]  From Great Neck, he says ecstasy.  She's fucking looking at him like she wants sex at that moment.  Keep going.  I know that they're faith in her choice to be with a man more than three times her age.  If you're wondering how this can all be legal, the reason is there was parental consent, no  sexual email exchanges, and no physical contact.  That man, Hutchison, wasn't breaking any statutory laws.  I mean, there is a joke.  16 will get you 20.  16 will get you 20 if you are doing something illegally. 
[02:30:30]  It was Krista who said, you know, you guys can get married if you want.  There are ways to do that.  There are certain states that allow it.  Oh, he had to get married a fucker.  In fact, 31 states allow 16-year-olds to marry as long as they have documented parental  consent and a birth certificate.  New York is one?  How are you thinking there?  No.  I was just thinking how much I didn't go.  Four years younger than his soon-to-be son-in-law, Courtney's father walked his daughter down  the aisle.  Look at the dad's face. 
[02:31:00]  The father is four years younger than he is.  Did you see the dad's face?  Oh, he's miserable.  It's like your world changes.  Now legally married, they were free to consummate their relationship.  I was a virgin when I married him.  Oh, stop.  She was saving herself.  I knew that if I kept that, I would really be blessed.  Wait, can you pause this?  Her asshole, maybe.  Oh, really?  Her ass was virgin.  You missed out on a finger of God moment there.  Really?  Yeah, I was a virgin.  Oh, yeah, that's what I said.  I got a finger of God.  You dropped your fork. 
[02:31:30]  Yeah, the reporter did a spit take.  All right, hit it.  God did.  He blessed me with my soulmate.  But at 16, do you really know?  I do.  I'm very mature for my age.  I'm an old soul.  And Doug can back me up on this.  I'll back you up.  He fell in love with me.  Do you think marrying Doug will help your career?  If it does, you know, that's just another beautiful blessing that God has to me.  But if I'm just with him for the rest of my life and supporting him, that would make me happy, too. 
[02:32:00]  They insist they are just a typical newlywad couple.  Her voice stinks.  But their relationship has many people outraged.  She's got dry mouth, too.  There's a lot of negativity online surrounding your relationship.  That you look much older than you are.  A lot of people online say you're a pervert.  What do you say to that?  I'm a pervert.  Courtney is Courtney's parents are the worst parents.  I'm a whore.  Pimps selling their daughter off. 
[02:32:30]  People are welcome to their opinions.  That's what they want to do.  Look at this, she's falling asleep.  If they need to feel...  What is she doing?  Not ours.  And Courtney wants to set the record straight.  She insists allegations that she's had plastic surgery are false.  Courtney's plastic surgeon...  Watch her mouth.  ...was God.  But Doug and Courtney will never be able to convince many people...  Just make it a shake.  It's in a bikini skin.  Bra bikini. 
[02:33:00]  This guy has to be dehydrated by that.  ...and even his own mother wants nothing to do with them.  She held me in her arms and I cried a little bit.  And we looked at each other afterwards and we said,  We knew this was going to happen.  We knew we were going to have to weather...  The storm.  The repercussions.  She sounds like Seinfeld.  And this is just...  The storm.  The storm.  He's my soulmate. 
[02:33:30]  Oh, that's great.  Should we 36 fucking feeding him?  Changing his diapers?  I don't think it'll last that long.  Let me go to Keith, Virginia.  Very upset with Anthony.  What?  Keith.  Yes.  Hey, sir.  Anthony.  Yeah.  You better make sure they're going to check all that shit on your computer.  Come on now.  What?  I don't know better.  What?  What?  To me, when you think about a 15-year-old piece of pussy, it sounds like it's going to be  all...  Did I say a 15-year-old piece of pussy at any point in my life? 
[02:34:00]  Did I say that?  Did you hear me say a 15-year-old piece of pussy?  I didn't say that.  You said...  I said a girl that you can look at a girl that is 15 and find her attractive, and you're  a liar if you say that's never happened.  I can make up what I want to, because I'm a listener.  I got a microphone.  I'm always right.  Oh, I know.  That's right.  Hey, Joe DeRosa.  Yeah.  Click.  He got you, is what it is.  I guess he did.  Oh, he hung up on me?  I knew it.  I knew that was good.  Some people say the Bill Burr tickets are going on sale today. 
[02:34:30]  Carnegie Hall is saying that.  I don't know.  I don't know.  Just keep checking.  Yeah.  All right, Joe, what are you promoting?  Oh, you promoted all that shit, so let's take a break and do some other things.  Yeah, huh?  You know?  Huh?  You know?  Yeah, huh?  Is that what I just did?  No, I just like that.  Oh, oh.  Yeah.  I don't know.  Huh?  Sorry.  Am I right or am I right, huh?  You know?  So that guy hung up on me.  Yeah, yeah.  That's an old gag. 
[02:35:00]  Yeah, it's...  Usually they do it to Jimmy.  They go, Jimmy.  And Jimmy goes, I know what you're doing.  You can tell by their voice.  It's weird.  Because I knew when he said, hey, Joe.  I just went click.  I knew he was going to fuck.  Yeah, because they have no light or joy in their lives.  None.  And they get so excited that they finally get to do something fun.  Dude, Joe.  At your expense.  At your expense.  Oh, well.  All right.  What do you need to...  Take a break?  All right.  I thought we broke two minutes ago. 
[02:35:30]  Break.  I promised a guy out there I was going to do this song.  She's got the best tongue work that you've ever seen.  She licks both my balls so they're shiny and clean.  And her pink little pussy's as tight as can be.  I know it's the cat, but it feels like a woman. 
[02:36:00]  Oh, I exploded her twat.  Now there's furballs and snot hanging off of my dick.  Oh, I got a phone call today from the SPCA.  Hey, I think they use the word sick. 
[02:36:30]  She rubs on my leg when she wants to get laid.  I duct tape her eyes when I spray her with rain.  She keeps coming back, but that's all right by me.  My girl or my cat, it all tastes like pussy to me.  The Opie and Anthony Show. 
[02:37:00]  The virus.  Sirius X.  We got Joe DeRosa today.  And we never played the Al Sharpton clip.  Which one was that?  I don't know.  I can't read or something.  Oh, oh, yeah, yeah.  I know Joe DeRosa's a big fan of Al Sharpton. 
[02:37:30]  River now.  The biggest.  You like River now, right?  Love him.  Makes some good points.  Excellent.  He's not an opportunist in your mind?  Not at all.  Not in the least.  This is Al Sharpton reading badly.  Tonight is the measure of whether the country begins in the state of Wisconsin, a national  drive to push back, or whether we have more to go to build a movement of resistance. 
[02:38:00]  But resist, we much.  We must.  We much.  And we will much.  Hey, what an idiot.  Whatever.  Yeah, he kind of sucks, that guy.  What was he trying to say there?  I thought he was going to say, we march at the end.  Wisconsin again?  What happened there?  Could be the whole Wisconsin thing.  Oh.  Well, that little election that they had.  Yeah.  Wisconsin.  Yeah, the recall election.  Didn't quite work out the way they wanted it to. 
[02:38:30]  That's too bad.  And that's because the Republicans, they made up the story of the Wisconsin State Fair with  the Blacks beating up white people.  Right.  They made up that story right before the recall elections just to get the Republican vote.  And it worked.  And they wound up holding on to the seats they needed.  So, yeah.  Oh, believe me.  Someone actually said that.  Somebody said they made it up?  Yes.  Made up the whole thing to win this election. 
[02:39:00]  But people make up shit all the time.  No one's buying into that guy.  But that's a crazy...  No, people...  But people do.  How many?  They go like...  I think a lot of disillusioned minorities look at that and go, man...  You want to hear...  Urban Al's an idiot.  It's a shame because there are people...  There are a lot of people in this country in a really bad position.  And he...  I think he really does take advantage of that.  You know?  Oh, yeah.  When people are lost, they're looking for leadership. 
[02:39:30]  And he doesn't do it in an appropriate way, I don't think.  Instead of really getting on the community and having them do for themselves and, you know,  keep the family unit together for a couple of years, he'd rather just blame and make shit  up and lie like he did about the Tawana Brawley thing.  Everyone forgot about that, by the way.  Yeah, of course.  Hey, could someone check on the Bill Burr tickets?  A lot of people are saying they go on sale today. 
[02:40:00]  And I don't want people to miss out.  So, Carnegie Hall's website says 11 o'clock.  Today?  Yeah, today.  Bill Burr is going to be at Carnegie Hall November 11th.  That's what the big announcement was today.  And the tickets might be going on sale today at 11.  All right, cool.  You want to hear Barney Frank farting?  Okay.  Does it just sound like this?  Because he takes a lot of cock.  He's a loose asshole. 
[02:40:30]  You think that's what it sounds like?  Yeah.  Pssst.  Yeah.  We have to figure out, all right, what do we do from here?  And you're right.  We've got to get some jobs.  And we have to deal with the debt.  And there's one way to do it.  We are today spending $140 billion a year, approximately, on Afghanistan and Iraq, to no good purpose.  And Iraq?  You're spending that much money on Iraq?  Oh.  Holy shit.  I told you.  You hear that again.  That's the food budget. 
[02:41:00]  Deal with the debt.  And there's one way to do it.  We are today spending $140 billion a year, approximately, on Afghanistan and Iraq, to no good purpose.  Fuckin' Iraq.  He looks like a Hanna-Barbera character.  Yes.  Like he'd be like the boss in the...  He'd be so easy.  He's going to rub a fire.  You're right.  You want to hear the fart again?  We have to figure out, all right, what do we do from here?  And you're right.  We've got to get some jobs.  And we have to deal with the debt.  Oh, that was a grumbly one. 
[02:41:30]  What kind of food causes that?  Something spicy?  That sounded like...  I don't think that's a bean fart.  That sounded like a coffee fart to me.  Like your stomach's...  Too much half and half?  Your stomach's hurting from all the...  Too much creamer?  It was rumbling before that came out.  He was very happy when that one came out.  Felt good.  He looks like his ass would just smell...  Oh, God.  Like after he gets up from his seat, it would just smell like poop.  Oh, my God. 
[02:42:00]  You know what I mean?  Swamp ass.  Yeah, he just looks like one of those guys.  No offense, you know?  Hey, I think everybody's been through a phase in their life  where they probably sat in a seat too long.  You know, played hours and hours of EverQuest online.  Done nothing but smoke cigarettes and drink.  Nothing worse than those air seats.  Oh.  You know what I mean?  Where you get up and all the air, you know, pops back up.  Every fart you laid into it.  And you smell everyone's farts.  Ugh.  Especially if it's a public chair.  Grandpa's seat chair. 
[02:42:30]  Oh, boy.  Yeah, did you ever know anybody like that, though?  That when they get up from a chair, you can smell like a shitty smell?  Ew.  Ass.  Do you know what I mean, though?  Oh, yeah.  Smell the chair you're sitting in right now.  Tell me what it smells like.  I don't know.  That's Jimmy's.  There's no way.  Please.  There's no way.  Please, Joe.  So much more has sat in this chair than just Jim.  And just Jim is enough for me not to smell it.  Yeah, that's true.  Fair enough.  Fair enough.  We got a listener request coming in, Ann, and you know how we love those.  Oh, yeah.  They're the best.  Someone writes, Theodore Sheckler writes from Missouri, if you like the Earl Weaver Manager's 
[02:43:00]  Corner, go to YouTube and type, ready for this, Sam?  Earl Weaver gets pissed.  Have we ever played that one?  I bet this isn't good.  Well, that's why I'm doing this.  Yeah.  Nine out of ten times listener requests.  Joe, suck.  Yeah, listeners don't usually.  I love the Earl Weaver stuff, though.  Oh, yeah.  Well, let's see if this one's good.  All right.  Behind the rubber.  He's got to go behind. 
[02:43:30]  Behind the rubber.  For me, he did.  Oh, listen to him, Eddie.  Behind the rubber.  Oh, bullshit.  Bullshit, you're stuck.  You're here.  And this crew is here just to fuck us.  Ha.  Boom.  Good.  That's great.  And you shut it.  Ah, you shit.  You're here for one goddamn specific reason. 
[02:44:00]  What's that, Earl?  To fuck us.  Ah, you're full of shit.  Fuck you.  Baseball.  And don't you ever put your finger on me.  You hit me, Earl.  You put your finger on me.  That's okay.  You ain't gonna knock nobody on his ass.  You do it again, and I'll knock you right in your nose.  I didn't touch you.  You pushed your finger on me.  I did not.  No, you're lying.  God damn it.  You're lying.  No, you are. 
[02:44:30]  You are lying.  You're a big liar.  You are a liar, Earl.  These are adults.  You are a liar.  You are.  These are adults.  Really?  Oh, my God.  You're lying.  Old-time baseball, though, man.  You're here for one reason to fuck us good.  Wrong.  That's the only reason you're here.  You are wrong, Earl.  And you'll have your chance tomorrow.  You got it as quick as you can.  What is wrong with you?  You ain't no good.  No, you aren't either.  You aren't either.  You ain't no good.  You're no fucking good either.  You stink.  Your ass will never have our games in the two years. 
[02:45:00]  I hope so.  What do I care?  Yeah, what do I care?  What are you doing here now?  Well, why don't you call the league office and ask him?  Yeah, I will.  Oh, good.  Don't think I will.  Good.  He keeps going after.  Hey, the quicker you get on, it'll be better, too.  Yeah, yeah.  That's right.  You ain't going nowhere.  You aren't either.  You left by five minutes and now who's in the Hall of Fame.  Jesus Christ.  Well, you're going to be in the Hall of Fame.  You know it.  Why?  You know it. 
[02:45:30]  For fucking up World Series?  You know it.  You're going to be in the Hall of Fame for fucking up World Series?  You know it.  I've won more than I've lost, kid.  I know you haven't.  James, count James.  You don't even know.  Oh, man.  I better get going.  I better get going.  What the hell is it?  Ha, ha, ha, ha.  He's going back again.  He goes back again.  Christ almighty.  You had your hands on me.  No, that's wrong, Earl. 
[02:46:00]  Tony.  Wrong.  Wow.  People are loving it.  Oh, how could you, right?  Yeah.  Fucking little Earl Weaver, man.  Look at that empty stadium, too.  Yeah.  Where are all the people?  Look at this shit.  It's just cheering.  What year was that?  It's probably like the 12th game of the season when no one cared yet.  There's not one piece of advertising up. 
[02:46:30]  I know.  Isn't that weird?  It's just the oddest thing.  Old school baseball.  Probably put advertising on every fucking little thing.  No one would have seen that either.  It would have just fucking gone to commercial.  We'll be back after this.  It's a shame, man.  It's a shame.  Yeah.  It's turning to crap.  Yeah, we have played that before.  Yeah, I know.  That's fucking funny, though.  But it's funny, so what the fuck?  As an O's fan, I fucking love Earl Weaver.  I'll knock you right in your fucking nose.  You're here to fuck us. 
[02:47:00]  Did you ever see the clip of the guy?  It got taken down.  I can't remember what player it is, but where he's calling the umpire a cunt or whatever.  Oh, shit.  Why would they take that down?  It's footage of him in the dugout, and he's going, he's a cunt.  He's a cunt.  And he starts doing this.  He starts making the pussy symbol with his hands.  Because he's a cunt.  And you can't find it anymore.  That's hilarious.  That's funny.  It's got to be somewhere.  We've just got to get it off YouTube.  We'll probably find it. 
[02:47:30]  Someone has a link to that.  Send it in.  They sounded like two fucking fifth graders yelling in a playground.  You're lying, Earl.  No, I'm not.  No, I'm not.  You are.  You're a liar.  You are.  Really?  These are two men playing in a professional sport?  That's fucking hilarious, man.  I love it.  Joe, you watch My Strange Addiction?  No.  Fuck, you're missing some good shit.  I don't really watch TV, man.  We had a lady yesterday that eats rocks. 
[02:48:00]  Yeah, she eats rocks.  Every day.  And a lady that's eating her husband's remains.  Oh, stop it.  Cremated ashes.  Stop it.  Yeah, she got some on her fingers once because the box opened up and she got this residue.  And she didn't feel like wiping it off on anything because she would take the urn everywhere with her shopping and movies and everything.  And she didn't want to wipe it off.  So she figured she would just lick it off her fingers.  And that started her wetting her finger, dipping it in, and just eating it like... 
[02:48:30]  How long is that going to last?  A week?  Well, she had six pounds of dead ash.  She's down to five pounds.  She's down to five pounds.  She's using it like a fun stick.  Was it a fun stick?  Dip.  Fun dip?  Fun dip.  Fun dip.  Sorry, yeah.  Gotta love fun dip.  Going back to her old weaver.  You know, the stick was the best part of that.  It's pretty vanilla-y.  No, that was the worst part.  I loved the stick.  Sam, you like weird stuff, so I don't care if you agree with Anthony. 
[02:49:00]  The stick was gross.  Well, I don't care that you don't care that I don't care.  The stick tasted vanilla-like.  It was very good.  That's why it was gross.  You don't like vanilla?  I love vanilla.  Look, I got nothing against vanilla.  Best flavor ever, vanilla.  Oh, get the fuck out of here.  If you could go through life with one flavor, let's do vanilla.  Are you nuts?  Yeah, vanilla.  Over chocolate?  Yeah, because a girl can't wipe chocolate on and smell good.  You got to think one fucking smell for everything. 
[02:49:30]  No.  Vanilla isn't everything.  What would be your smell?  Smell.  I'll go with strawberry over vanilla.  Well, smell is one thing, but taste is complete another, especially with ice cream.  Are we going taste?  You can't wipe ice cream behind her ears and not have it smell like fucking rotting milk.  So I would say, taste-wise, I got to go with vanilla ice cream.  Would be your number one.  Yeah.  Yeah, if I needed only one ice cream.  Are we going ice cream or one taste? 
[02:50:00]  I would have to go with vanilla ice cream.  Well, what else?  Are you?  That's insane.  Are we going taste or ice cream?  Why?  It's so creamy and goodness.  One ice cream over chocolate.  Yeah.  Chocolate.  What about peanut butter?  You really are just...  Ugh.  For one taste?  Peanut butter.  I hate peanut butter.  One taste, I'd go peanut butter.  Oh, God.  Peanut butter is the worst thing.  One flavor for the rest of your life of any flavor on the planet, you're going to pick  peanut butter.  Yep.  Over bacon, over ham.  Yep.  Keep going. 
[02:50:30]  Apples.  I'm allergic to apples.  I get explosive diarrhea.  Sorry.  By the way, the Earl Weaver hit, I have to acknowledge this because it's coming in, but too many ties  by too many people, they're confused.  That was Earl Weaver and not me talking about management.  Oh, okay.  Too many.  People thought it was one of the meetings.  Especially the line, you're here to fuck us.  You're here for one reason, to fuck us.  So, fuck us.  Peanut butter. 
[02:51:00]  Would be my flavor.  That's better than vanilla.  Over steak?  Yeah.  Oh.  That's steak.  It's fucking...  It's steak.  You've got to eat it at every meal for the rest of your life.  Man.  You're not going to want to eat peanut butter for dinner.  Yeah, I am.  But you could eat steak for breakfast, dinner, or lunch.  Think about it like that.  Maybe tomato sauce.  Now we're talking logistics, though.  I mean...  Are we looking for one flavor?  And not just taste.  One taste or one flavor? 
[02:51:30]  You've got to go to...  Same thing, I guess, right?  One taste, peanut butter.  You've got to go to categories.  It's two...  You can't...  You can't taste steak every day.  You can't taste peanut butter every day.  You get sick from tasting anything.  You can taste peanut butter every day.  You can't taste steak every day.  You've had a bad steak where it tastes like nothing.  You know what my one flavor would be?  What?  Pussy!  Good Seasons Italian Dressing.  What?  I'm serious.  That's it?  Just chugging it down?  It's the best flavor thing I've ever... 
[02:52:00]  It's like my favorite tasting thing ever.  Can I acknowledge this rookie that just asked me a very basic question on Instant Feedback?  I'll quote him, or I'll read his thing here.  Mike Michigan.  Hey, yo!  You ever put peanut butter in your ice cream?  Dude, fucking...  I don't know why do you think I'm 10.  Of course I have.  Ugh.  Peanut butter goes well with everything.  That's not true.  No.  You ever have the Reese's peanut butter ice cream they have out there now?  Look, I've...  George Washington Carver?  Peanut butter cup ice cream, whatever the fuck it's called. 
[02:52:30]  I've eaten more peanut butter than you can wave a stick at, kid.  Yeah?  But it doesn't go with everything.  No.  Ant doesn't like peanut butter.  Hate it.  Why do you hate peanut butter?  Ant doesn't like a lot of things.  I know.  We're troubled.  And surprised that he picked vanilla as his favorite flavor?  Yeah, exactly.  What does that say?  Do you see his face?  You don't like chocolate?  And he goes...  He goes with vanilla.  Of course he did.  That was good stuff.  Vanilla stinks unless you dump sauce of some kind on it. 
[02:53:00]  Vanilla bean, though, man.  I like chocolate sprinkles on it.  Like a Carvel.  Sprinkles are a waste of my time.  They're like whipped cream.  Get out of here.  Waste of my time.  They add nothing, man.  I don't know.  I'm talking hot fudge.  That's a topping.  Okay?  Yeah.  Strawberry reduction.  That's a fucking topping.  I'll give you that.  Peanut butter sauce.  That's a fucking topping.  You just can't deal with the peanut butter.  We can't do...  Oh, go ahead, Joe.  Go.  Oh, sorry.  No, no.  No, I had nothing. 
[02:53:30]  No, sorry.  I really didn't have anything in there.  I just felt like I haven't been heard from in a while, so I figured...  Yeah, we just battled about nothing.  Just throw something in.  Yeah.  God damn it.  Go ahead.  I'm sorry.  No, I really didn't have nothing.  Oh, really?  Yeah, I just realized.  I was going to ask Ann if you would do dice talking about ice cream toppings.  It doesn't do requests.  Well, like vanilla, chocolate.  I don't care.  Whatever's coming out of her pussy, I'll eat it.  It's called Reese's Peanut Butter Ice Cream, and it's out of this world. 
[02:54:00]  Look up my ice cream of choice.  Have you had...  Dice, have you had Reese's Peanut Butter Ice Cream?  Bopey says it's good.  Yeah, and his broad wiped it on her tits.  Yes, I fucking licked it off and threw her out of my house.  Oh, gosh.  Because I'm a tough guy.  Now sleep on the floor, bitch.  Really?  What girl is it going, really, Dice? 
[02:54:30]  Really?  In the middle of his big comeback with Entourage.  Let's calm down.  Oh, well.  That was funny.  I love Dice.  And Joe, we didn't acknowledge the other thing about the peanut butter thing with Anthony.  What's that?  Invented by a black man.  Of course it is.  Also, George Washington Carver.  Right.  Peanut butter is the Puerto Rican of ice cream.  Yes.  Look at that.  Look at that.  Look at that.  Look at that.  Breyers.  That looks good, dude. 
[02:55:00]  Reese's.  Is that just insane?  Oh.  I ate the whole tub.  Yuck.  Peanut butter sucks.  It fucks up shit that's good.  Have you ever had-  Chocolate is great.  A fucking Hershey thing, it's great.  Now you throw a little chocolate swirl in the mix with some peanut butter shit.  You know how great jelly is without peanut butter?  I love jelly.  I love a jelly sandwich.  I've had just jelly sandwiches.  You've got a strawberry rhubarb jelly to die for.  I've had just jelly.  You fucking create it.  I've had marshmallow fluff. 
[02:55:30]  Marshmallow fluff on bread without peanut butter.  And fluff is queer than jelly, Joe.  Just marshmallow.  I'm calling him a queer.  He is.  He is.  Yeah, did it look like a little bit of cum on the bread there for you?  It really did.  And a string of it went from my lower lip.  No, I hate marshmallow fluff, period.  Yeah?  I love marshmallows, but when you spread it on a-  It's too much.  It's like-  It really is.  As a kid, it was good.  You actually could taste the granules of sugar grinding. 
[02:56:00]  Yeah.  When you just-  Oh, that's bad for you.  Bad for your teeth.  Oh, yeah.  You didn't-  You said sugar?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Why, what?  What?  Nothing.  Problem?  I don't want to talk about it.  What's the matter?  You brought it up.  I was-  I've said it many times, and people really don't believe me, but I swear it's true.  We used to have to eat margarine and-  Margarine and sugar sandwiches.  And sugar on, yeah.  Oh! 
[02:56:30]  Not even butter.  They couldn't even get fucking butter.  Who eats margarine and fucking sugar sandwiches?  It's delicious.  My buddy told me he used to eat those when he was a kid.  Are they good?  Dude, you would turn the sandwich sideways, and you'd lose half your sugar.  Whatever it was that's sticking to the goddamn margarine would fall out of your sandwich.  Jesus Christ.  This is the opening scene of the movie they make about your life.  Eat your sugar sandwich!  I'm not even fucking joking.  I would have toast with butter and sugar and cinnamon. 
[02:57:00]  Yeah.  That was kind of good.  Do you remember that?  That was pretty good.  I never-  But you have to toast the bread.  This was Wonder Bread.  They didn't toast it.  No, you had to toast it.  What's that sandwich called?  Butter and sugar.  Is that just what it's called, or did it have a name like Fluffernutter?  The food stamp sandwich.  It's called-  Mom didn't want to cook.  It's called-  Maybe Mom should have got a job.  Bringing some extra money.  So we can afford the real peanut butter, not the no-frills peanut butter. 
[02:57:30]  Don't get me started, Joe.  I never saw Wonder Bread unless I went to a friend's house.  Yeah, I know.  We didn't have that problem.  Were you a Fluffernutter guy?  No, I hated the peanut butter.  I would just marshmallow fluff.  With what?  Huh?  On bread.  With what?  Just fluff.  That's almost as bad as margarine and sugar sandwiches.  That's so fucking gross, man.  No, it was great.  Fluffernutter sandwiches sucked because it was so dry.  No, no, let me tell you something. 
[02:58:00]  Fluff-  Yeah, go ahead.  Fluff, the second you opened it, because it would go like that big jar sound, and that  was, when it was brandy new, I would take a tablespoon and just take a huge fucking tablespoon  out and just eat it like that.  That's so gross.  Nah, I'm a man.  No.  I'd throw some on my back.  We did used to get some fluff in the house every once in a while.  I'll tell you what, I've never been eating marshmallows and going, you know what?  The problem is, these aren't wet enough. 
[02:58:30]  If these could be wet, it's disgusting, man.  I need runny marshmallows.  Yeah.  Can I have some over-easy marshmallows, please?  Keep putting runny.  That's good stuff.  Oh, banana, peanut butter ice cream, a Dairy Queen shake?  Get the fuck out of here.  How peanut butter got so popular?  Spooky1111 on Twitter.  That's it.  Another thing I never got into was bananas with the peanut butter.  I never, never got into that. 
[02:59:00]  Sam, I decided I'm going to stay today.  Thank you.  I told Sam to put 942 on the screen when it was 942 so we could leave.  Well, that's not when the show ends.  Huh?  Yeah, but see, if we leave at 942, they're confused.  They're like, well, we can't yell at them that they left 10 minutes early.  We could end at 42.  They said, look, I don't want to tell you what to do, but.  There was a but in there.  And I said, but Sam needs a raise.  And then we could stop this whole nonsense. 
[02:59:30]  I mean, I appreciate you saying that.  Did they really talk to you?  Yeah, I swear to God.  Jimmy arrived when I was yelling.  Why?  What was the problem?  They think it makes Sam look bad.  But isn't this fun?  It's me and Anthony's bit.  It has nothing to do with Sam.  Sam has nothing to do with the Sam needs a raise bit.  Do they understand that through the years of doing radio,  Opie and I have realized that the soap opera-ish approach to certain subjects  really works well, where every so often, every week or so,  you keep something going, bring it up, it goes a little further, 
[03:00:00]  you give them a little recap of what's happening,  and people like the storyline keeps going.  Do they understand that that's part of radio and part of what we do?  I think they do to a point, but I think the problem is we have a lot of people  associated with this channel that don't like being talked about.  So why did you sign up for the gig?  But it's radio.  Right.  Why did you sign up for the gig then?  I think the Sam needs a raise bit is a good one,  especially with all the production coming in from the listeners. 
[03:00:30]  Of course.  Do we have any new ones?  Sam was asked to ask for a raise every week.  It was his problem that he wasn't asking frequently enough for his raise.  We know that, though.  Yeah.  He wasn't asking for a raise enough.  But see, if we don't talk about it in the air,  then everyone just kind of forgets about it.  But if we're talking about it every week,  then it shows how ridiculous this whole thing is.  And then you don't have to go in and ask,  because we're pretty much asking for you by proxy.  They'd probably like it if I, you know, approach them myself as well.  Ah, whatever, right? 
[03:01:00]  Fuck them, right, Sam?  Fuck them.  Fuck them, right, Sam?  That's what I say.  No, it's not my entire sentiment.  Sam, all we want is you to answer questions.  So, you know, you're not shown in a bad light.  Here's today's question.  All right.  Since your last raise, whenever that was, I don't know and I don't care.  Okay.  List all the responsibilities that were added onto your plate.  Well, I am the host of your fifth hour from 10 to 11 in the morning, 
[03:01:30]  which is actually 8 to 9 a.m. on the West Coast.  That's a sucker.  Replays throughout the day.  That's a sucker.  Is that what you just said?  Yeah.  Fucking asshole.  He's a sucker.  Jesus.  So you now basically do an hour of Opie and Anthony's.  Yeah.  Okay.  Yeah.  If I was running the company, I would think that's a biggie.  Yeah, that is a biggie.  Because we're a high-profile show.  And now, I mean, because you're hosting that hour, it does keep some of the listeners, you know, staying tuned. 
[03:02:00]  Yeah.  I know we beat you up about the show, but the show definitely serves a purpose and it's doing well.  And the money, extra money from that?  Zero.  Me and Aaron.  Never mind.  I don't want to tell Sam.  He'll be depressed.  No, go ahead.  Oh, I know what you're going to say.  I was thinking about this.  Yeah.  At NAW, they want us to do an extra hour because the rest of the fucking station sucked a dick.  Oh, yeah?  Yeah, and I think we settled for $50,000 each.  Yeah, we were like, you know what?  Oh, boy.  It's going to cost you. 
[03:02:30]  Holy shit.  I think.  That makes me angry and I'm not even staffed here.  It made us angry because we wanted more.  Yeah.  We never talk about money in general, but that's one I guess we can let out of the bag.  We refused until they gave us 50 Gs each to do an hour.  An hour more.  Oh, yeah.  And that's just commercials and stuff.  Right.  Not on satellite.  What else have you added since?  Well, I'm full-time in the studio as the in-studio producer now.  Yes, yes. 
[03:03:00]  Congratulations on that promotion.  And the money from that?  Oh, zero.  That's why I don't know if it was a promotion as much of a lateral move, it would seem.  You're doing more shifts for Hits One.  Yeah, well, I still do the full-time overnight and also fill in.  And this all happened after your last raise, right?  Yeah.  So just give Sam a raise.  Four shows he does.  At least.  Sometimes five.  Sounds like you're working your balls off to me. 
[03:03:30]  Volunteer on Saturdays still.  Volunteers on Saturday.  Yeah.  Just to get yourself ahead in this business.  I guess.  And are we getting interns?  I believe it is being worked on.  When is Gary coming back from vacation so we can talk to him about this?  Gary's back from vacation.  He's been back since Monday, Tuesday, and now today's Wednesday.  So three days.  Is that why when we come in and I notice the difference in the show is, oh, that's right,  there's no difference whatsoever, him being here or not being here. 
[03:04:00]  That's right.  That's right.  None whatsoever.  Everybody's probably down there.  I have not had a conversation with him and he's been back from vacation for three days.  Well, you've made it very clear on the air that you don't want to have a conversation with him.  He's probably in meetings.  I bet he's in meetings.  He's probably in a meeting.  I noticed there was an email that was sent out more things that might be happening in  the future.  Like what?  I love those.  They might be actually changing the name of the channel.  In the future, like 23, 23? 
[03:04:30]  I don't know.  They say September.  That means probably 2014.  I thought you meant like the real future.  Yeah.  I do believe the intern situation is being actively pursued.  Yeah.  I was told that six months ago.  All right.  That sounds great, guys.  That's promising.  Remember, Ant, and I'm going, I don't just say shit.  I practice what I preach.  Uh-huh.  If you don't see them, they're not there. 
[03:05:00]  I like that.  I'm going to go with that.  See, but.  So I walk right through them is what you're really saying.  Ah, fuck yeah.  All right.  Walk right through.  That's your problem.  You see them every time.  But if you don't see them, they're not there.  I need people is what I think.  But I'll try that.  But I think I need people to run block for me.  I told you.  See.  If we dress Travis up like Anthony.  Oh, oh.  Yeah.  Do the body double thing.  And then they'll turn him around.  They'll grab him by the shoulder.  Turn him around.  Yeah.  And they'll go, hey, you're not.  And then they'll see me slip out the door at the last minute. 
[03:05:30]  Precisely.  Like, why he got us again.  You turn him around and they go, you're Sylvester Stallone.  Right.  You're supposed to believe that shit.  Nighthawk, right?  Yeah.  I love that.  Sam, you should watch the movie Hoffa.  Yeah.  I'll get you all worked up to get what you need.  Yeah.  Watch the movie Hoffa.  Yeah.  Get this whole place up in arms.  Wow.  Yeah, that's not true.  Never mind.  I was going to.  All right.  Hey, all right. 
[03:06:00]  We can move on.  So Gary's back from vacation.  That's good news, I guess.  He's been back since Monday.  I've had multiple conversations with him.  He's been on a great vacation.  And more things have been added to the list of things that might happen.  So that's progress.  Look at those lights.  Our lights are up.  Yeah, but that's not what we asked for.  But they're good for the pictures.  Okay.  Hey, could you turn them on?  I want to see what they look like on.  We do have lights installed.  Jesus Christ.  Joe, could you do a radio show if these things were on?  What?  No.  What are they doing? 
[03:06:30]  That's for when we're taking pictures with big celebrities.  You're doing an Oliver Stone scene in here?  Yeah.  Fuck it.  I know.  I really could use those at home.  I thought you had a few of those at home.  I do.  Yeah, you don't light for imagery.  It just went on a radio show.  Yeah.  I want it to look flushed out, see?  Because the metaphor.  Yeah.  What we're doing is.  I just asked for everyday lights that were better than what we had that would make video  and pictures look good as well. 
[03:07:00]  Have you noticed if the pictures look better with this light on?  I don't know.  Let me see.  I'm going to give it a try.  It's literally making me a little lightheaded, to be honest with you.  Yeah.  I get it.  It's bright, dude.  I thought you meant just lightheaded.  What do you mean?  I don't get it.  Oh, Christ.  Yeah.  All right.  My brain couldn't go that shitty.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Let me see this.  You're seeing if the picture looks better?  I'm just going to take a picture like this.  Okay.  All right.  Now, turn the lights out, and let me take another one.  Oh, very good idea. 
[03:07:30]  And we're going to, all right, turn that on.  Don't turn them both out.  You should do one on.  No, we're going to take them both off.  I just want off.  All right.  Okay.  All right.  All right.  And there.  Pretty much got both pictures.  And I got to tell you something.  Yes.  All right.  There's the light on.  There's light off.  You know what?  I'm digging the pinkish hue on that one.  I think we could fix it in post. 
[03:08:00]  Yeah, that looks shitty, man.  That does look shitty.  It's all, like, washed out on half.  It's washed out.  Wait, the light one is shitty?  Yeah, because they're not balanced.  That's the thing with lighting in a picture.  Yeah.  You got to fill out.  Certain lights create hard shadows.  You got to fill it out.  So now it's like half of your face is fucking bright white,  and the other half is dark.  Yeah, we have no, actually.  There's no, like, you need a light over there.  Yeah, yeah.  You got to do a three-way, or else it's going to look crazy.  And then have, like, side fills. 
[03:08:30]  Yeah, but they only found two in Howard's closet that he wasn't using.  And I think we need better filters on those,  because they're a little harsh.  Those are just, like, those white.  Aren't those those white kind of clothy, just diffuser?  Yes.  Yeah, you need something a little, like a kind of a, I don't know,  maybe a flesh-colored kind of...  There's no such thing as that.  That's what you're saying right now.  There's no flesh-colored filter. 
[03:09:00]  No, some kind of gel or something that would...  Supposedly, they put gels over these.  Oh, did they?  They did?  Yeah, I see that.  Oh, that's kind of...  They look a little more peachy.  Yeah.  Yeah, no, you need a third light above your head, Oak.  Yeah.  That's okay.  Triangulate.  Well, it wouldn't illuminate you.  It would hit the person here.  Joe, I got a question for you.  Put it on.  You see this nice coat rack?  Yeah.  How long do you think it took to install as you asked for a third light for the studio?  I'd say eight months. 
[03:09:30]  That's pretty good.  How long did it take?  If no one wants to talk, just give me fingers in the air.  How long did it officially take?  Three months.  Three months.  Three months.  And I asked for it when winter started.  Because they couldn't decide.  I need to hang up my winter coat.  Three months later, when spring hit, they got the coat hanger up.  I'm tired of it.  This is union busting.  Oh, yeah.  Blood hours.  So, my strange addiction. 
[03:10:00]  We're going to move back into the show a little bit.  Oh, right.  Remember the lady that ate the rocks?  I certainly do.  And we were talking about the lady that ate the remains of her husband.  I think we were done with that, right?  So gross.  That led to the flavor and all that, I think.  And the ice creams and all.  And fluff and utter.  The ice.  Sprinkles are a waste of Joe DeRosa's time.  All that shit.  Oh, yeah.  So, this lady eats rocks.  And a bunch of us noticed that maybe if you put a beep in, it sounds like she's into something else.  Oh, into something else.  Oh, okay.  Okay.  Let's listen to that.  We're going to give this a try. 
[03:10:30]  My name's Teresa.  I'm 44 years old.  I live in Bedford, Virginia.  Pretty day today.  And I'm addicted to eat rocks.  I don't think I would be able to function every day if I didn't eat some quantity of rock.  Teresa has been addicted to rocks for more than 20 years.  She was initially attracted to the earthy smell.  I was just out walking one day. 
[03:11:00]  I had no intention of eating it.  But I did.  And once I did that, I was hooked on them.  Now, Teresa can't go more than a few hours without eating rocks.  I actually like how it feels on my teeth.  I'm very worried about Teresa.  When your body can't handle what you're putting inside of it, it's going to rebel against you.  This is about the size I like it because it's not as hard to swallow.  I would normally take a **** like this and normally just put it in my mouth. 
[03:11:30]  And get the **** taste off of it.  Oh, my God.  That's great.  Could be the best one ever.  Jesus.  Oh, yeah.  That could be the best one ever.  She loves the cock.  Did you edit that at all?  Was that straight through?  Just beeping the words?  No, there were some edits.  That's **** brilliant.  That's a good one, man.  You can't lose with rocks.  No.  That's a good one.  The references to biting were taken out because then it was just like she's actually chewing and swallowing. 
[03:12:00]  Chewing.  She would bite the rocks apart?  Yeah.  She would sit there and go like...  Yeah.  It's **** hideous to watch.  How could she do that without breaking her teeth?  I don't know.  And then she takes some rocks and bangs them with a hammer and then eats those like little  pieces, pebbles, and you hear her crunching.  Like Skittles.  How is that possible?  You'd break your teeth.  Nah, she finds those rocks that kind of fall apart a little bit. 
[03:12:30]  She likes the brittle ones.  The brittle rocks, you know, like you find in the Dakotas.  What the ****?  Jesus Christ.  People are idiots.  It's...  Talk about just creating problems for yourself.  Yeah.  I know.  There's enough shit out there to worry about.  I mean, Christ.  Get addicted to...  Salads.  ...a drug or something.  I was thinking how her asshole must get ripped apart because there's nothing that is being  digested in a rock.  And then on top of it, she's shitting out rocks.  Yeah, she's shitting rocks out. 
[03:13:00]  See, see, then...  ...in the top.  Get it?  Yes.  How her asshole must be getting ripped apart.  And then on top of that, she's...  Come on.  Come on.  That was old school.  Come on.  Come on now.  Hey.  Well, guys, I think we had a fine show today.  I **** had a pisser today.  Absolutely.  I must say.  Boys, thank you for having me.  Joe DeRosa in.  Joe, thank you.  Thank you, guys.  It's always a nice time.  No, thank you, Joe.  Joe DeRosa.  No, thank you.  I say thank you.  What's that?  Smurfs? 
[03:13:30]  What is that?  Oh, Rio.  It's Rio.  The only thing I want to see less than the Smurfs.  Boo.  Oh.  Did Rio do good in the theaters?  Yes.  I'm going to check it out.  It did very well.  And internationally.  Is it Pixar?  No, no, no.  Oh, I don't want to see it then.  It's by Blue Sky.  No, I only look at Pixar stuff.  Blue Sky does a lot of good films, too.  Like what?  Well, they did the Ice Age series.  Oh, shit, really?  Rio, Horton, Here's a Who.  I always thought the Ice Age ones looked kind of low rent compared to all the other ones. 
[03:14:00]  Yeah.  No, serious.  I'm not being a dick.  No, you're right, though.  I don't think so.  They just didn't look as, they didn't have as much going on as, they got better as they  went, but yeah, they just looked much more stark, right?  I'll tell you, this last one was 3D.  Ice Age 3D.  Do I get glasses for this?  No, that's Rio.  That wasn't, well, I think that was, but that one, it's not 3D.  Where's my 3D glasses?  It's HD, not 3D.  I want 3D.  It's not in 3D.  It says 3D-esque set here. 
[03:14:30]  It says 3D-esque.  Oh.  It says 3D.  No.  What if it was just an animated version of Blame It on Rio?  The one had nice fucking bosoms.  Remember?  I don't.  They're big and heavy.  I don't, I barely remember.  Demi had little ones in that.  And she covered them with her hair, like fucking, like splash.  Demi Moore?  She's in that?  Yeah, she was in that.  Yeah, before she got her tits.  She shows her tits in About Last Night. 
[03:15:00]  Yeah?  Mm-hmm.  The big fake ones?  No, no, no.  It's before she got the...  Oh, before she got the...  That was one of those Rat Pack movies.  Ah!  No, it wasn't.  Or Brat Pack.  It was neither.  Oh, Brat Pack?  The Rat Pack.  It was neither, actually.  Was it?  No.  You're thinking of St. Elmo's Fire.  Yeah, I know.  What was the one after that?  About Last Night was Jim Belushi and Rob Lowe.  Oh, well, Rob Lowe was part of the Brat Pack.  He's a Brat Packer.  It was a Brat Duet.  I bet there was another one in there, so it's a Brat Pack movie.  No, there was only two of them in it.  You know, I challenge you and say there were three. 
[03:15:30]  That movie's a fucking atrocity.  Let me see the one with the covers on her there.  Let me see.  Oh, there you go.  Oh, yeah.  You know.  Yeah, she was all right.  Was that General Hospital days?  Could you show the Bush picture, please?  The Bush one is great.  I just, it's got to be real, right?  That's real.  Look at the way it's hanging down.  She's the hairiest fucking pussy.  That's Demi Moore?  Well, there's a better Bush picture of her.  It doesn't look like her.  No, the better Bush picture is great. 
[03:16:00]  Give us the better Bush picture.  Giant.  Giant.  Hairy.  Giant hair.  It's that one.  It is that one, but they cut it off.  They cut it off on Google Images?  Wow.  Motherfers.  What do you got?  Filters on, you fag?  Take your filters off.  Yeah.  Filters not on.  I remember.  I've seen that one.  Maybe click on it, and maybe it gets bigger.  Oh, yeah.  Maybe.  I don't know.  Yeah, click on it.  See what happens.  You can see just from the corner glimpse.  Yeah, yeah.  There's a little bit of hair there.  Boy, that is really hairy. 
[03:16:30]  Dive in that.  You'll just go.  Puh.  Puh.  Puh.  I saw a picture of Alyssa Milano once.  I forget.  I was at some radio show, and they showed it to me, and it ruined her for me forever.  Uh-oh.  She was dressed.  She's so hot, man.  She was fully dressed, but she had a belly shirt on and low-rise jeans, and they zoomed  in on her underbelly button area, and dude, there was like a dark hair trail that was 
[03:17:00]  leading down the boat, and it was like, it just ruined her.  I was like, I can't, like, I didn't find her attractive after that.  You didn't like that?  No, dude.  It was so, it wasn't sexy, dude.  It was like.  Yeah, show us.  It's manly.  Yeah.  Show us the bikini picture.  Oh, this is going to be her hair on her head.  Well, look how pubes are ready.  Wow.  Oh.  Hmm.  Hair, you got to put Alyssa Milano, hairy pussy. 
[03:17:30]  It was, it was, she's like, she was like in line at like a red carpet event or something.  It was, it was, it was a, it was a press shot or whatever, paparazzi.  Hmm.  Hmm.  Going to have to look for that at home.  That's a shame.  Put the bush trail.  I don't know.  Yeah, belly hair.  Put belly hair.  Belly hair.  All right.  Come on, you fuck.  Is that a red? 
[03:18:00]  It's Joe.  Not Sam.  I mean.  It's such a great appearance on our show and they're only going to remember this part of  it.  What about that with a pants roll?  I'm sorry.  I think, yeah, I think I ruined it.  Nah.  Yeah, I don't fucking.  I think you're right.  We can't find it, Joe.  Damn it.  Oh, wait.  That might be it right there.  It might be that one with the purple shirts.  No, no, no.  No, Sam, up.  No, no, no.  Sam, down.  No, Sam, don't scroll.  Sam's the worst.  There you go.  It might be that one.  All right, let's take a look, Joe.  You can save this. 
[03:18:30]  Now go.  Zoom.  Now do something with that picture.  Full-size image.  Yeah.  He's waiting right on the side.  Sam panics.  Oh, great.  Good resolution.  Great.  Way to go, Sam.  That's really not about it.  You know what?  You don't deserve a raise.  Yeah.  He's waiting right on the side.  Oh, shit.  Whoops.  Which one?  He's right on the side.  Which one?  He's waiting right on the side. 
[03:19:00]  Which one?  He's staring at us.  Oh, shit.  God damn it, I see it.  I told you he's back.  That's it, I think, but you can't see it.  It's all blurry.  All right, look.  He can't take us all at once.  I say we rush him.  If you go right, I'll go left.  Let's see what happens.  Okay.  He's going to take one of us out.  I understand that.  Okay, look.  I'm going to go.  I took the shit yesterday.  I'm going right.  I got it.  No, that's fine.  Send DeRosa out to talk to him and say, hey, I'm Joe. 
[03:19:30]  And Joe DeRosa is introducing himself, you two make a run for it.  I would do that for you guys.  That's a good one.  I got an idea.  Okay, what?  What?  Because you're right.  He talked to you yesterday.  Yeah.  You go right fast in front of him.  He goes, Ant, I got a question for you.  But he's not in front of him.  He's to the left.  He's going to follow you.  Listen to me.  No, but if you go that way.  No.  Okay.  You go that way.  Yeah.  He goes after you.  Yeah.  And one question. 
[03:20:00]  I can't today.  I'm late.  Talk to O.  By the time he turns around, I'm now fucking out of here left.  If we both go at the same time, it'll be so flustered.  How about this?  But we split directions.  He's ready for you guys.  I'll say.  I'll tell him when I'm ready for him.  I'll say, all right, guys, ready to record.  And then the three of us will make pretend like we're going to Derek's studio.  Around the corner.  Around the long way.  And then you two make a run for it, and I'll come back in here. 
[03:20:30]  I'll go, all right, guys, ready to record.  Make sure you get ready now before you're off the air.  That way we can go right out the door.  Could someone ask him what he wants?  No.  I had a really nice four hours.  I did, too.  And I don't want to ruin it like this.  Someone ask him what he wants.  Seriously.  Oh, shit.  And can it be done with email? 
[03:21:00]  No, I'm serious.  Anything can be, by the way.  This is giving me the farts.  Yeah.  This is nerve-wracking.  All right, Sam's asking him.  This is just going to make problems.  I don't have no fucking problems.  No, I mean, because now, I mean, problems getting out of here,  because now he's going to be on the defensive.  All right.  Now he knows.  Sam's coming back.  What does he want?  He's staring right at us through the glass, by the way.  So what's up?  What's going on?  It's an insulting thing for me to have asked him.  Yeah, but you did it for us. 
[03:21:30]  I did it for you.  What did he say?  He would like to show you something, a positive thing.  It's a logo for something.  That might happen.  I already said that on the air.  I don't care about positive things.  Tell him to put it up to the glass.  Okay.  Tell him to send it in a PDF file.  No, but tell him to put it up to the glass.  Seriously.  Okay.  Jesus Christ.  Put it up to the glass.  Because all it is is a logo.  This is, I got to see his reaction to this. 
[03:22:00]  All right.  He's going to put it up to the glass.  All right.  Let's see.  Let me see.  He's going to put it up to the glass.  Here we go.  No, put it up to the glass.  All right.  All right.  Let's see.  Oh, well.  Looks similar to the other one, doesn't it?  It certainly does.  It's just that.  But it's a different word.  What do you mean it's a different word?  See, look. 
[03:22:30]  What?  It's uncomfortable.  Oh, the channel part?  Yeah.  Yeah, that's cool.  Yeah.  All right.  We concur.  Lovely.  Welcome back.  How was vacation?  It was fantastic.  Thank you.  Really?  Did you miss us?  Did I?  Did you miss us?  Did your blood pressure go down drastically?  I definitely enjoyed sleeping in.  I must have been.  Yeah, sleeping in is the greatest part of vacation.  It really is. 
[03:23:00]  I've got to agree with you on that one.  Okay.  Thanks for having me.  Where are you going, by the way?  Yawn City.  Yawn City?  All right.  Down the old highway.  That's it for today?  Down there?  That was easy highway.  Yeah, that was good.  That is good.  If it happens, that'll be exciting.  Very, very exciting.  Now we just want to see it happen.  Very exciting.  Rocktober.  It's guaranteed for Rocktober?  Oh, Jocktober.  I'm excited that it's creeping up.  Jacktober.  I love Jocktober. 
[03:23:30]  Would it have been way out of line, because I really wanted to do this.  I was going to do the old, can I see it?  And then crumple it up and throw it.  That would have been.  Oh, would that be out of line?  It would have been, right?  Oh, we'd have been in a meeting.  As long as the mics are on, it would have been fine.  Okay.  Well, that's why I didn't do it.  Yeah, as long as the mics are on.  The real man does it when the mics are off.  All right.  Oh, look.  He's down there.  I'm so out of here.  I'm so out of here.  He's down there.  I'm going right.  Well, that seems like a pleasant conversation that could have happened off the air without  much of an issue.  Yeah, but I don't need that.  I don't need those.  It's too big. 
[03:24:00]  You kiss ass.  I don't need nonsense in my life, Sam.  I'm just saying.  Oh, no.  Roland's grabbing me.  What?  What do you want, Roland?  The Russian dolls, they want to come in.  No.  Zero stars in the paper.  I'm out.  Oh, my gosh.  What?  And also, there might be management there or there.  Other people.  Yeah.  I'm going to go this way.  Oh, that's our ice room.  What do you mean, other management people?  I'm kidding.  See you.  Ant's deciding.  All right.  Does he go left or right?  I'm going to make the wrong choice.  You've got to go right.  I'm telling you, right now. 
[03:24:30]  Oh, he's going right.  Okay, and that way you can watch him.  No, because the other guy went right.  So, he's done.  So, the only other option is guys waiting to the left.  What?  Yeah, Eric's waving him down the hall.  I'm telling you.  And I'm going to go left to prove that I'm fucked.  But hopefully Eric's not in the hall while Anthony's walking because he'll block the  whole thing.  All right.  Are we?  Is it off?  Is it over?  Are we still on the air?  No.  Oh, all right. 
[03:25:00]  Yeah.  You would think that was on the air?  I have no fucking idea.  Why would we broadcast that?  That's nonsense.  About what?  About, I think that's funny.  Let's see you guys trying to figure out how you're going to avoid everybody.  Well, yeah, they're useless.  Yeah, that's funny.  Don't say, I mean.  What?  Don't tell Joe they're useless.  It doesn't matter to Joe.  I don't give a shit.  All right.  All right.  Why would Joe care that we think the bosses are useless?  We are going to have a poor opinion of the station. 
[03:25:30]  I don't give a fuck what these guys are doing.  All right.  Yeah, they're just, you know.  I get it.  I mean, you get, I don't get to see this, though, ever.  This is such an interesting thing for me to see, though, is like, guys, in the position  you're in where you bring in revenue so you can kind of tell them to fuck off a little  bit.  Yeah.  I can't fucking do that.  I gotta, you know, when I gotta deal with guys like that, I gotta take their shit.  Oh, that's gotta be the worst.  Well, I know it's the worst, because we did that for years.  Yeah, yeah. 
[03:26:00]  So, I do know it's the worst, but, yeah, you know, maybe someday you'll get to the position  where you can tell assholes like that to fuck off.  I'm not either, which puts me in an uncomfortable position.  You said it earlier, though.  Did Ann make it out?  Mm-hmm.  He made it out?  Yeah.  I think so.  He made it out.  You need a little help with sex bagel, but...  All right, guys.  Thank you for having me.  You want to walk home, Joe?  Yeah.  Let's do it.  What do you want to do?  Want to make a video or something? 
[03:26:30]  I gotta, uh, I gotta get over, uh, to the bank.  For you?  I didn't twitch it today.  Okay.  All right.  Can you, can you come with me and then...  What bank?  TD on 50th and Broadway.  50th and Broadway?  Or 50th and 7th, whatever it is.  Turn down the street.  Oh, that's where the crazy people are.  Yeah, I got it, I got it.  That's where the guy was that was kicking and spitting at everybody.  You weren't there that day.  I want to find him again.  Yeah, that's fine.  I'm gonna repost that video.  All right.  I'll be in the hall.  Yeah, I know.  A lot of, uh, black sites are reposting the video. 
[03:27:00]  Black sites like your stuff?  What?  Black sites like your stuff?  Uh, I don't know.  World Hip Hop?  Is that a big site?  Yeah.  How do you know it's a big site?  Hey, Mars goes...  Yeah, Mars goes for the ass pictures.  Yeah, I guess they, uh, reposted it in a few other places.  He didn't...  He didn't know.  What?  He really didn't know again.  We did this...  Joe!  We did this last time.  We did the same thing.  He walks by the on-air light like 20 times.  By the way, I didn't say it on the air, but, um, the whole Wienergate, Anthony Wiener thing, 
[03:27:30]  and how...  Oh, yeah.  ...how we, uh, got a lot of press out of that.  This guy, Amartime on Twitter, he's, he's a talented, uh, editor from, uh, Canada.  He put together an amazing video.  It's my latest video on YouTube right now, and I tweeted it, uh, a couple times yesterday.  Go to my YouTube channel, Opie Radio, or my Twitter.  Look at my timeline.  There's a link there.  But the guy did a great fucking job with that video.  You see it, Sam?  No, I didn't see it yesterday, but I saw you posted it.  Yeah, it's pretty good.  Can you get Joe in here?  Joe! 
[03:28:00]  He's handling the girl.  Joe!  Let's try to pick up a girl outside the window.  We were on the air.  Didn't we do this to you last time?  Yes.  Yeah.  Do you remember last time we did this?  It's the same scenario.  Well, Anthony just left.  I don't understand. 
[03:28:30]  That's what we do.  We just leave.  Because we don't get, we don't have to worry about ratings here, so we just fucking get willy-nilly.  But remember last time we did this whole bit with you?  How did I get you with this again?  You weren't even on the mic.  You were over there.  Well, I figured you might be a little smarter this time, so I backed, I went over here.  No, dude, that's, I'm the most gullible guy on earth.  Obviously.  We might not even be on the air right now.  I don't fucking know.  No, we're on the air.  All right.  I got scared because I thought you were going to say some shit.  Are you picking up that girl or what? 
[03:29:00]  I gave.  What's your chances?  I gave her my number.  Yeah?  And said, come to a show and text me.  And I got a bunch of shows.  Did you get a good vibe?  Yeah, we got a good conversational vibe going on, but I also didn't want to, Kenny was  really trying to hook it up.  He hyped him up all day.  Really?  Yeah.  So I thought it was like a little, I was like, you know what, take my number so you feel comfortable.  Call me and come to a show.  Did you tell her that she's got to wear old lady clothes to go out with you?  Yeah, pearls.  Yeah, I told her I want to give her a bath with Epsom salt in it. 
[03:29:30]  Isn't she a little young for you?  You like him in your 50s and 60s, don't you?  They told her I was 42.  She believed that.  Everywhere you go, you get in a lot of trouble, both of you.  You know what?  We could almost even...  I'll play it during the 10 o'clock.  Yeah, it might work.  Yeah.  Because what the kid did, too, was got the Naughty Boy phone from Drew Boogie, and he  laid it over the video.  I'll play it.  The guy did a great job, so, you know.  You know, the virus, the real virus fans know who that girl is that you're talking about. 
[03:30:00]  Who is she?  She's a virus employee.  No, she's not.  She is.  I've never met her before.  Because she's only in here on Saturday nights.  So the weekends have nothing to do with the virus.  We do, there is a live show on the virus.  That's like, you know, that's like barter time.  No, it's not.  Yeah, to make a little extra money, the company just allows shows to broadcast on our channel  on weekends.  What is it called?  Timeshare or something?  Pity.  What is it called?  Paid programming? 
[03:30:30]  Paid programming.  I don't pay.  I'm on the channel on the Saturdays.  No, no.  That's part of the paid programming.  Who pays for it?  I don't know.  They're making money off the shows on the weekend, but they have nothing to do with  the virus, the opening Anthony channel.  That's not true.  I've been doing it for like two years.  No, it's true.  Plus off and on for like four years.  It's paid programming.  Like, you know, they give an hour to a guy that wants to sell razors.  That's never happened on the virus.  No, it's happening.  I'm telling you.  What about Dr. Steve?  That's like some weird medical program they do. 
[03:31:00]  That guy bought time to just be on our channel.  That I believe.  He's a little strange, but.  Me and Joe got to go to the bank together.  Yeah.  Everyone knows where the bank is, Joe.  Yeah.  You gave out the cross street on the air.  We're just like the Beatles, so I don't know.  Good luck, you know, trying to get through all the fans that are going to now join us  on the street.  Join us at the bank.  You know, you didn't end your show.  You're just leaving.  This is what I mean.  You guys aren't on the air.  I don't believe you.  Joe actually doesn't think. 
[03:31:30]  You don't think we're on the air?  No, because you were playing audio while you were talking.  If you don't think we're on the air, tell your deepest, darkest secret right now.  No.  No.  Take a chance.  No.  Take a chance.  Absolutely not.  That means you know we're on the air.  I don't know what it is.  You're like the devil.  It's lies weaved in with the truth.  I don't know what's happening.  I don't believe you.  Anything you say.  All right.  You don't think we're on the air, right?  I don't know if we are.  Oh, boy.  Roland is filling that girl's head with lies right now.  Look at him.  He's spitting that fucking thing like an old city goer. 
[03:32:00]  Yeah.  With his pocket watch.  Yeah.  Yeah.  You're right.  We weren't on the air this time.  I'm serious.  We weren't on the air.  Next time.  All right.  You're just messing.  You're right.  Why would we just walk out?  All right.  Ratings don't matter.  We could just walk out.  Do you think we were on the air or off the air?  I don't know.  He doesn't know.  He really doesn't.  He shut the door.  What would you guess, though?  If you had to guess.  I have headphones on. 
[03:32:30]  You could just turn that on.  No, you can't.  See, Roland.  If Roland's saying we were on the air, that means we're on the air.  He never lies.  Roland actually lies all the time.  Is he going to go out with Joe?  That's pretty much all he does.  Yeah, they're arguing right now.  That's Harmonica from Special Delivery.  I'm just going to go out with Joe.  I'm sorry.  I'm Veronica.  Oh, she's not going out with Joe.  Oh.  And by the way, you know what her name is on Special Delivery?  It's Harmonica.  Like Harmonica.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  I'm sorry.  I just...  You're not going out with Joe?  I don't know.  I don't think so.  She likes divorcees. 
[03:33:00]  You've been divorced twice.  Monica!  What?  What are you doing?  Go out with Joe.  Okay, okay.  Okay, she'll do it.  She's just going to go to his comedy.  Can they hear me out here?  Yeah, kind of.  Are you going to just go to his comedy show?  Eight, eight, eight.  Eight.  Turn on mic eight.  Wait.  This is still not after.  Is this on?  Yeah, now it's on.  Hold on, hold on.  Please tell her you're kidding.  I'm not kidding.  Wait.  I can't lie to you.  Joe.  Sam, I'm not going to be able to hear you, so just let me take this for a minute.  Yeah, for sure.  I can't lie to you.  Hey.  So Joe asked you to a comedy show? 
[03:33:30]  Yes.  So you're going to go to the comedy show?  I suppose so.  But you're not attracted to Joe?  I don't know yet.  Oh!  You're not.  That's a no.  Is it the lack of shoulders?  Wait.  It's the worst.  What happened?  Let me just do a man what a man needs to do.  All right.  Let me just...  Why can't I just be friends with somebody of the opposite sex?  That's right.  Why can't she be...  Let me just be a fly on the wall.  I'll shut up.  This is chaos.  Just work the magic.  Make believe this mic's not right here.  I'm still working on a show.  We already...  We already...  It already...  It already happened.  I gave her my number. 
[03:34:00]  We're good.  You did tell her you're a divorcee.  And he's 42.  One kid.  I'm not 42.  He's 42 and divorced.  I'm 34 and single.  Okay.  Does he have a shot?  I don't know.  That means silly, John.  It doesn't mean no.  It means no.  It doesn't mean yes.  What about your kid that you never see anymore?  I know.  Well...  You have an illegitimate child?  I don't think...  I don't think I'm going to go for that.  Several.  Do you think Joe's attractive?  Yeah.  He's handsome.  Thank you.  Monica's just looking for excuses.  Fuck.  Look at Joe. 
[03:34:30]  Joe's got a swagger out here.  Do you like Opie's singer from Def Leppard jeans he's wearing?  Well, I...  At the end of there?  Yeah.  Yeah.  You're really hip.  One of your buttons is undone.  Well, because I don't like button all my buttons.  Just in case.  Just in case.  No, I take a lot of leaks in the morning.  Okay.  So you're prepared for that?  I do have more button undone.  Did you buy those like that?  Why?  Were they all roughed up already?  The jeans.  Well, I put my foot through this knee.  That's the worst thing that happened.  Yeah, I know.  That's why you can't buy them with the holes, because the holes... 
[03:35:00]  It's just in you make the holes bigger, and then they don't sit properly.  Yeah.  All right.  Work your magic, Joe.  I'm just kind of hanging out here.  Thanks.  Nice talking to you.  I'm done.  That's the magic.  You don't know...  Are you really going to go to a comedy show with him?  He's really funny.  I'll probably go with a girlfriend to one of his shows.  So he'll be on stage.  He's stuck.  Let's go to Carnegie Hall.  You know, I'm going to be...  Yeah, he's going to be at Carnegie.  You can work it.  I'm going to be...  She doesn't have to know you're only going to do five minutes as an opener. 
[03:35:30]  I'll do 20.  20?  Nice.  20.  Carnegie Hall.  Carnegie Hall.  There's a stage.  You know what happens at Carnegie Hall?  Dreams come true.  And yours will come true on November.  When is it?  11th.  11th.  Whoa.  Tickets on sale in about a half hour.  I know.  Now I have a goal.  My dream will come true.  I can get you a discounted ticket.  Discounted?  Why can't you just get me a free ticket to your show?  That was the joke. 
[03:36:00]  Free tickets for girls that, you know, might put out a little bit.  We're going to do a kind of thing.  Okay, so I'll take the reduced rate because I'm not going to put out.  See, you guys, this is deruiting.  Sorry, Joe.  No, I don't.  But it's Carnegie Hall.  So?  I wouldn't have heard of him.  She said so.  I would never have heard of you as a lady and as a woman and someone with independence  and rights.  Joe doesn't make enough money, huh?  I don't know.  It might be a money thing, Joe.  I got to.  I got my. 
[03:36:30]  She is blushing.  You're making this poor girl.  Wow.  She just blew you off.  She turned her back to you, Joe.  Sam, it's not working out out here.  I know.  We've been listening.  Okay.  Don't believe anything you guys say about me.  It's all.  Literally all lies.  I'm not just saying that.  Just to make myself.  The microphone keeps popping back up.  I feel like the paparazzi is following us.  It's not on.  I'm not just saying that to make myself look good.  Oh, it's not on?  No.  Sam.  This got boring.  What's happening?  We're off the air.  It was never on the whole time.  What?  It was.  That mic was never on. 
[03:37:00]  I would just hold a mic like this?  Yes.  Maybe we're on.  He's so confused.  You would.  What's happening?  What?  It's not.  Why did Monica just wander in here?  All right.  We got to go, Sam.  I don't even know if that made sense to me.  Well, Joe is trying to kick it to Monica.  And Monica is being unreceptive.  And for the record, she's also said Eastside Dave is handsome.  So she throws that word around liberally.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  What do you got there? 
[03:37:30]  Yeah, take the mic.  There you go.  Joe, is she going to go out with you?  Everyone wants to know if she's going to go out with you, Joe.  It's very high volume.  These people are trying to work down here.  Here's the thing.  Are we on the air?  No.  We're talking into a mic.  It's not even on.  This is harassment. 
[03:38:00]  This is becoming a hostile work environment.  Oh, my God.  I know.  That's awful.  Stop.  It hurts.  Okay, bye.  I think we should just leave.  Let's do it.  Can we go?  Oh, sorry.  Sorry.  Sorry.  Sorry.  Apologizing to the engineers as they walk by.  Sorry.  I hope he's embarrassed.  Do it again.  I don't fucking do things I'm cute, Joe.  Okay, now he quit because Joe told him to do it again and now he's... 
[03:38:30]  Now he's stopping.  He's talking into the mic still.  Yeah.  Well, you were just...  No, I fucked it.  We're just having fun, Joe.  I know.  I'm having fun, too.  We're just goofing around.  She has no interest.  She's back doing a Facebook update.  She really went back to her Facebook?  She's updating her Facebook.  That's not a good sign.  Any chance of this happening has been completely ruined by you guys. 
[03:39:00]  Thank you.  Well, not by me.  I was in here.  Thank you all.  You found her attractive, didn't you?  Roland, Roland, Roland did.  You fucking asshole.  Tells him I'm divorced.  She believes it.  With a kid.  Jesus.  Just once.  Joe was never married.  You think she heard?  What's her name?  Monica.  Monica, Joe is never married, and he doesn't have any kids, and he really would like you 
[03:39:30]  to go to one of his comedy shows.  Everybody's looking.  She said she is.  Are you going to the show?  Yeah.  But if you don't put out, Joe is not interested.  Attention, Sirius XM.  Joe doesn't go out with girls that don't put out.  She ran away.  She ran away, Joe.  I think it's over.  Is it harassment?  What?  It is.  It is.  What happened?  You created a hostile work environment.  I did?  Yeah.  Yep.  And you did it live on the air. 
[03:40:00]  Finally, they now have to fire me.  That's how you go out?  By yelling through a blowhorn in the hallway?  Watch this.  Watch what I do now.  Didn't you used to do edgy stuff?  Ow!  Oh, Jesus.  He's smashing equipment on the ground.  Let's throw it to break.  After Opie and Anthony Live is coming up next.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  On the virus.  Sirius XM.  Recently on the Ron Fais Show.  Do you have any tats? 
[03:40:30]  No, I want one.  I want to get a tats.  What do you want to get?  I want to get a little bunny on my wrist for my mom.  A little pink bunny because her name was a bunny.  That's really sweet.  Oh, here we go.  Go ahead.  Where's the jab?  No, there's no jab at all.  I should do that for my dad.  What would you get?  His name is Dick.  Ron and Fez, next at 11 a.m. Eastern on The Virus. </pre>
