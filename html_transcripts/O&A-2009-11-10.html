<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast began with a discussion about a friend, Hugo, who looked remarkably like Steve Perry and fronted a Journey tribute band, "Evolution," leading to a legal battle with Journey after a gig was promoted misleadingly. This transitioned into a conversation about Aerosmith's potential split fueled by rumors of internal conflict and Steven Tyler's injuries.  The hosts then delved into a listener-submitted topic: "fag songs that rock," dissecting songs perceived as outdated or less "tough" by modern standards.  Numerous songs were analyzed, including those by REO Speedwagon, Styx, Aldo Nova, and Loverboy, with the hosts employing homophobic slurs throughout this segment. Pictures of Hugo were shown. Callers contributed their opinions on the music.

Next, the show tackled Tracy Morgan's controversial Carnegie Hall performance, noting audience walkouts, particularly among women, due to his raunchy jokes about homosexuality, drugs, pornography, and the Obamas. A caller, John from Jersey, corroborated this, highlighting the racial divide in audience reactions. This was followed by a segment on Susan Boyle's *Britain's Got Talent* appearance, contrasting the initial dismissive reactions to her appearance with the stunned applause after her performance.  The hosts used highly offensive language to describe Boyle's appearance while criticizing the initial negative reactions as hypocritical and reflecting societal biases.  Clips from *Britain's Got Talent* and news shows were played, along with discussion of Sharon Osbourne's comments and a poll favoring Boyle's attractiveness over Osbourne's.

The broadcast briefly touched upon the upcoming execution of John Allen Muhammad, the Fort Hood shooting (including criticism of security and political responses), Jimmy Norton's scheduling issues, and David Hasselhoff's drunken appearance at the MTV Europe Music Awards.

A significant portion of the show focused on the Fort Hood shooting, with hosts and callers expressing outrage and speculating on the shooter's motives and the military's failure to address warning signs. The conversation included discussions about profiling Muslim soldiers and the broader issue of Muslim extremism.  This transitioned abruptly to a vulgar discussion of the sex toy "Cum Sox," featuring detailed descriptions and sexually explicit dialogue.  A caller mentioned James Gandolfini's confrontation with paparazzi, followed by news of Kareem Abdul-Jabbar's leukemia diagnosis.  The show concluded with a discussion of the release of *Modern Warfare 2*, featuring caller input and one host revealing their Xbox Live gamertag.  A brief, dismissive discussion of a "Top New York Songs of All Time" list was also included.

A later segment heavily featured a sarcastic and profane critique of *Rolling Stone*'s list of top New York songs, with Opie, Anthony, and Jim Norton expressing extreme disdain using highly offensive language.  Audio clips of David Hasselhoff (intoxicated), Andre Agassi (discussing his hairpiece), and a picture of a short pregnant woman were played.  The segment was filled with explicit sexual references, jokes about bodily functions, and offensive racial and ethnic slurs. A long series of knock-knock jokes with a recurring gangbang theme was also included.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  The history of misogynistic behavior. 
[00:00:30]  The home of incest and anal sex.  I mean, it's just, it's crazy.  I am a fucking lunatic.  Stop, stop, stop.  I love it!  What a freak show.  What a Ringling Brothers Barnum and Bailey freak show.  Best of our abilities.  We'll try really hard every day.  What are we going to do?  Best of our abilities or a good show?  This is what the show is.  Silly, stupid, whatever you want to call it.  Listen to it and like it or don't.  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road. 
[00:01:00]  We'll be right back. 
[00:01:30]  All right, good morning.  That's funny.  Glad I slipped that one in before the mic got hit.  How come my luggage has footprints on it in the closet?  Long story.  Very long story.  Hey, shit.  We were talking about Fake Journey, Steven Tyler.  Yep.  Oprah.  We already did a little mini radio show.  Like we said, we should tape it and that way we have some material if we just want to sit back and jerk off.  Not a bad idea. 
[00:02:00]  Yeah.  Does everything sound loud today?  Let me see.  Let me try that.  All right.  Oh, wow.  That's low now.  Really?  No, I'm way low.  How about that?  My headphones are a little low.  This or this?  This or this?  This or this?  This or this?  HP up.  This?  Yeah.  This?  Up.  I'm playing fucking ear doctor, you asshole.  Oh.  This or this?  I'll raise my hand.  All right.  This or this? 
[00:02:30]  This?  All right.  Try this now.  All right.  That's good.  All right.  Right there?  Yes.  Please tell your fake journey story, man.  Oh, yeah.  Well, a buddy of mine and my brother.  My brother actually used to be in the band.  It's called Evolution.  I know.  I know the band pretty well, too.  He's got Hugo.  My buddy, Hugo.  We've played Hugo stuff on our show.  Oh, yeah.  And Hugo, for years.  I mean, since like 1980 fucking two, has looked and sounded exactly like Steve Perry from Journey. 
[00:03:00]  And when you say exact, you mean exact.  Yeah.  It's crazy.  It's ridiculous.  It's crazy.  And he, as Steve Perry got older, Hugo really doesn't look older than he did back then.  It's weird as shit.  Still got the long straight hair, fucking, you know, just looks like the guy.  Right.  Um, so they got this offer to do this gig, uh, where the, the guy, um, putting the gig 
[00:03:30]  on said, just, uh, roll up, go on, play, don't say anything or anything, and then just  leave, uh, and, you know, I'll pay you.  So they're like, yeah, it sounds like a great gig.  Fuck it.  I'll do that.  So, uh, they, they do it, do the gig, leave.  Then they didn't know that this guy, the promoter had never said it wasn't Journey.  And, and he had up pictures of like Journey's album covers and shit. 
[00:04:00]  Nothing saying it was a tribute band or anything.  So it turns out, um, uh, uh, it got back to Neil Sean from Journey, guitar player, and  he calls up Steven Perry and goes, what the fuck are you doing?  You know, you're playing out and saying it's Journey and cause this big thing got started  that, oh my God, Steven Tyler's back, uh, Steven Perry is back with, uh, Journey.  Right.  Cause spinning image of fucking Steve Perry on stage, they're playing the songs to a T and 
[00:04:30]  rumor got around that, uh, and got back to Neil Sean that, uh, they actually were playing  together again, which would never happen.  They fucking despise each other.  So he called him up and said, what the fuck are you doing?  And, uh, uh, uh, Steve Perry's like, I don't know what you're talking about.  I haven't, you know, I didn't gig.  I didn't do anything, especially under, uh, the Journey name and everything like that.  So, uh, they found out who it was and it turned out to be, um, you know, evolution. 
[00:05:00]  Hugo's band.  Yeah.  So Neil Sean actually gets on the phone and calls the guitarist from, uh, evolution.  Neil Sean calls the fake Neil Sean.  The fake Neil Sean.  And just starts yelling at him.  Oh my God.  Saying, you motherfucker.  What are you doing?  Motherfucker?  You're not allowed to do this.  He motherfucked him.  Uh, and then the lawyers got involved.  And if you look, their, their logo evolution is directly off the evolution album cover.  Right.  Well, not anymore.  Is that the, yeah.  Temporary page under construction. 
[00:05:30]  See, look, they, they motherfucked him so bad.  The lawyers shut him down.  They made him pull everything.  And they said, for every gig you do and, and the songs you play, we're taking, um, I think  it was 10 or 15% of whatever they earn and has to go to fucking journey.  Are they allowed to do that now?  With the cover bands and the tribute bands?  Who knows?  But if you're, if you're going out there like that, I guess as a tribute band, I don't know  what the, what the whole thing is. 
[00:06:00]  I wonder if the lawyer, I wonder if the legal thing was, they said 10% or we, we'd sue you  and then you have to litigate.  Sue everyone.  But then you got to litigate against Journey who got a lot more fucking money than you do  and you have a chance on losing everything.  They might've agreed on that.  The perfect solution to this would be if Journey, now they got that Samoan guy, some, uh, Samoan  guy, Tony Rocky horror, Tony.  And they got some Samoan guy.  It's fucking good.  It was really good.  But, um, there've been problems out on the road with them as far as, uh, how do you know 
[00:06:30]  this?  I hear, I hear things problems like with his voice, uh, burning out after a few shows.  Um, he doesn't have that longevity of being able to hit those, those crazy notes night  after night Steve Perry did.  You go, just go out there and fucking blast these things out.  Journey should fucking hire you go as the front man.  They'd be, people would be shitting their pants.  He's your friend, right?  Yeah.  Yeah.  We'd go way back with him.  Oh, you know him too?  Yeah.  When I was just a fucking, uh, BAB guy doing, uh, night times, nighttime radio, I would interview 
[00:07:00]  him cause he was in bands that were almost making it.  You go find a you go.  Is that you?  That's wait, wait.  Who is that fucking you go?  I don't know.  Or is that Steve Perry?  I can't tell.  Oh, that's what's showing up for, for Hugo.  All right.  Now show, there's another picture next to that, that one that says Hugo.  I'm going to have to blow this one up a little bit.  Um, it's like the same, I don't get, I, I, I'll find one.  Well, like I can't, he's my fucking friend, dude. 
[00:07:30]  And you can't tell if it's.  And I can't tell if it's, cause there's some poses where he does this, he does all the moves  that, that Steven Perry did.  Yeah.  He's got, uh, Perry's moves, uh, down.  No, what they should do is just.  That's Hugo.  Yeah.  All right.  That's fucking Hugo.  That's not Steve Perry.  Is he fatter than Steve Perry by a few pounds?  No, he's, he's saying it when he sings, like he gets that Steve Perry, like thing comes out.  You know, when you jowls a little bit, when you push your chin back to get into a picture.  But that's, that's how Steven Perry's saying pop up Steven Perry from like, um, the seventies. 
[00:08:00]  No, yes.  Steve Perry, they hate each other's guts.  Why don't they just get back together?  Uh, maybe Steve Perry can't hit these.  They hate each other.  Oh, they do.  They hate each other.  Steve Perry moved on to a thing years ago.  Dude, it's, it's uncanny.  Look, that's, that's Steve Perry.  Why does it in the long neck?  Jesus, what a creep.  He looks like you.  Why doesn't the current journey just hire a lot of different Steven Perry's?  Or at least two.  Like, where's that guy from? 
[00:08:30]  Like Joe does with 2U, just franchise the whole fucking thing.  The one kid is from, uh.  All right, that's Steve Perry.  I don't know.  All right, that's Steve Perry.  But, oh, the Philippines.  Yeah.  The new singer's from the Philippines.  And then you get Hugo from Long Island.  It would be a nice combination.  Just cause they.  And they could switch off, uh, the gigs.  It's like, just cause they got fucking, uh, a singer that looks like him and everything  and shit.  I'm like, I'm alone.  What are they doing?  Wow.  What's it hurting?  Did he explain that they didn't know that they were being billed as Steven Perry's version 
[00:09:00]  of Journey?  They were just like, oh, what?  So when the Neil Sean called the guitarist, he's like, what?  He goes, what?  He goes, yeah, there's fucking rumors that Steve Perry is back with Journey.  He goes, that isn't true.  What are you guys trying to do?  Are you trying?  Like, he thought they were trying to bill themselves as Journey and bamboozle people.  Amazing.  And, uh, yeah, that's a little bit of drama going on in the, uh, musical.  In the tribute band world.  In the tribute band world.  In the tribute band world. 
[00:09:30]  So, yeah, their, their website is under construction.  Oh, man, they shut him down.  They shut him down with that journey, with that Don't Stop Believin' Money.  Don't Stop Believin' Money.  That Don't Stop Believin' Money goes a long way.  Fucking A.  Poor Hugo, man.  Struggling musician who's really talented.  Really talented.  Yeah.  He's had a few solo, uh, things going under, under some, uh, major labels.  His, uh, a lot of his songs are featured in, uh, um, uh, Kill the Babysitter. 
[00:10:00]  What was that one?  Don't Tell Mom We Killed the Babysitter.  Oh, really?  Don't Tell Mom the Babysitter's Dad.  Christina Applegate.  Yeah, Christina Applegate.  He did some of the music for that?  Uh, yeah, yeah.  You could hear his, uh.  That's pretty cool.  His music in that.  What was the name of his band he was pushing back in?  Uh, Valentine.  Valentine, that's right.  Yeah, Valentine.  I interviewed him at BAB, and he goes, he goes, last year this time I was mowing the  lawn outside BAB.  That was my gig.  I was a landscaper.  Now I'm inside, and you're interviewing me for my band. 
[00:10:30]  Yeah, that was fun.  I guess he had some European success and whatnot.  Yeah, yeah, you know, they always, they always do that.  There he is.  There's, there's Hugo.  That's Hugo now.  God, who, what's, who's the creepiest?  Bobby Kelly.  Ha, ha, ha, ha.  All right.  Ah, shit, yeah, that's the topsy-turvy world of rock and roll.  Speaking of music, we'll throw this in, it's real quick, but Steven Tyler supposedly, uh,  we kind of talked about this a little bit yesterday, supposedly he's Quaid Aerosmith.  What?  I read a whole article on Rolling Stone, and Steve Perry, uh, Joe Perry. 
[00:11:00]  Jesus, this is gonna be a nightmare.  With Steven Tyler, Steve Perry, and Joe Perry, when you talk about the three of them, you just  fuck.  Oh, my God.  So figure it out.  Joe Perry, right?  Yeah.  Joe Perry's basically saying, yeah, we're looking for a new singer.  He's not saying that Steven Tyler has left the band, but he's saying it wouldn't be the  worst thing to look around for a singer that could do some gigging.  He Twittered, uh, he Twittered it, and, uh, Steven, they said they'd been fighting and 
[00:11:30]  they had to end the tour because he broke his shoulder, Steve was held off the stage,  and nobody went to the hospital with him, like, they, that guy didn't really, they'd start  to get his guts up to 40 years.  Yeah, but the problem is, uh, I think they were talking to Brad Whitford, uh, Whitford,  and, uh, he said that the band doesn't even talk to Steven Tyler.  It's one of those things where...  Brad Delp?  Brad.  Oh, wait, what?  Who?  Didn't Brad Delp, uh, sleep with the fucking barbecue?  Ha, there's no idea.  Which one slept with the barbecue?  Brad Delp?  Yeah, that was Brad Delp.  All right, we're all over the place now.  Uh, they said that they don't even have contact with, they haven't had contact with, uh, 
[00:12:00]  with Steven Tyler in years, even though they gigged together and all that.  It's like, kind of like the Scott Weiland thing that we checked out that one time, where,  you know, they're separate entities.  It's Steven Tyler and the rest of them, according to, uh, I think it was Brad said this in an  article in Rolling Stone, uh, magazine.  I would put it to, um, to a Joe Perry, if they're looking for a fucking singer, they should  just comb the tribute band circuit.  There are some really good fucking, uh, uh, Steven Tylers out there. 
[00:12:30]  Right.  That sound and look like them, so fuck it.  Why wouldn't you do that?  I'll tell you why.  Nobody wants to see that right now, because they, they are just, they're still seen as  a bad, that only works after, say, five or ten years of being broken up.  You think?  Yeah, nobody wants to see fucking those guys with a fake Steven Tyler.  Well, but if it sounds...  Hold on a minute, Aerosmith's been, they haven't had a new album in...  That's true.  ...seven, when was, uh, Just Push Play, I think it was the last, uh, album of the year,  right?  And a lot of people...  That was about 2001, 2002.  Yeah, and a lot of people are pissed when they go see him that they play those stupid 
[00:13:00]  fucking songs from Armageddon and all that shit.  Let me tell you what that's about.  I did a whole fucking research project yesterday.  Oh!  What's Armageddon first?  I don't know what that is.  The movie Armageddon.  Basically, you never saw that one?  Yeah, yeah, sure.  Bruce Willis...  They're arguing about the direction of the band.  Steven Tyler wants to continue down the Armageddon poppy, more poppy music.  It's like, mainstream type, uh, type of songs.  Yeah.  And, uh, Mr. Perry there wants to stick with their roots, you know, and keep it bluesy. 
[00:13:30]  Keep it bluesy and dirty like they used to do.  But if you get, like, a tribute band, Steven Tyler, you put him out there, and now you can  do whatever the fuck you want, because you have every...  You could tell him, you know, suck our dicks after the show, and he'd probably fucking  do it.  And then you could just train him to be the new fucking Steven Tyler.  And people would probably be psyched, like, alright, now we're seeing the kind of, you  know, Aerosmith we wanted to see.  Well, don't forget the success that, uh, Journey had with this new Filipino singer. 
[00:14:00]  Yeah.  You don't think of some of these bands that have, like, a member in the band that has  problems, they're not looking at Journey and how they succeeded?  Maybe personality.  By replacing a main member?  Voice problems, maybe they're looking like fucking Crypt Keepers or something like that.  Yeah, you go, get out, we got, we're combing the fucking tribute band circuit.  The new, the new Journey with this new singer, they were on Oprah.  Yeah.  Singing Don't Stop Believin'.  Who the hell would have thunk it this 20 years later?  That's pretty fucking huge.  With a different guy, and...  Without that other guy whose name we don't know because it's all mixed up today. 
[00:14:30]  I don't know.  Steven Perry?  Fucking Steven.  Steve Perry, though.  You can't say Steven.  Steven Perry, yeah.  Steven Perry's a director, I think.  Steve Perry is, uh, yeah, like, you'd think, alright, Journey could not continue without  him.  He's, he had the voice, the fucking, he was the front man for the band.  Yeah.  And then they wind up being successful without him, so fuck it, years later.  But the other thing, because, you know, Joe Perry's saying a lot and Steven Tyler hasn't  really talked yet, you know, because those are the two main guys, obviously, they've  run together and all that.  Yeah.  Uh, Steven Tyler's pissed because when he broke, what did he break? 
[00:15:00]  Shoulder.  I read it with his shoulder.  I think he had a couple injuries, though.  I think he went down twice.  Oh.  And his shoes fell off.  I can't start getting that out of my head.  Oh, you said it's wonderful.  My ass neck.  What were the fucking injuries?  I know there was a shoulder.  I know he had a gash in his head.  Something about his head, neck, and chest area.  I was burned.  Steven Tyler's claiming, like, because he had to say, I can't tour anymore.  Yeah.  And they had a whole summer of touring ahead of him.  And I guess management said, and this is typical management, they wanted Steven Tyler 
[00:15:30]  to continue the tour.  This is Steven Tyler saying this.  Oh, shit.  In a wheelchair.  Come on.  In a wheelchair.  You know what?  Now that's something you don't want to see as a fucking fan.  Are you kidding?  No, not as like a hardcore fan.  I would line up for tickets to see Steven Tyler in a wheelchair.  You're twisted.  Would it be a special one with hydraulics so he could do those moves, those Steven Tyler  sideways moves?  Because he'd have fucking bandanas tied to it. 
[00:16:00]  He's basically saying, I can't move.  I'm fucked up.  I can't continue this tour.  And they basically insisted that he continues and that he uses a wheelchair.  What they do, I can't walk this way.  Yeah.  Here's the story on the possible ending of Aerosmith.  The sweet emotion of Aerosmith has turned sour as lead guitarist Joe Perry has confirmed  frontman Steven Tyler has quit.  Together for more than 40 years, Perry hasn't been able to connect with Tyler, saying he hasn't 
[00:16:30]  been 100% for a long time.  And the legendary rock band may be looking for a new singer.  There you go.  Joe Perry is 59.  Steve Tyler is 61 years old, man.  That's a fucking 40-year collaboration.  And then I think Perry's daughter, Steven Tyler's daughter, defended him on Twitter and she's  like, you know...  Which one?  The fat model?  Mia.  Oh, yeah.  Mia's fat.  Oh, she's the fat model?  Yeah, she's fat.  And she's like, look, they're in their 60s. 
[00:17:00]  Let them do what they want.  They're in their 60s?  She's probably saying, like, if my dad wants to do solo shit, let it go.  They're old men.  Leave them alone.  Yeah.  Fucking baby.  What else are they supposed to do?  If those guys don't have money saved.  Look at that fatty.  Ugh.  Oh, my God.  She's not that bad.  I'm telling you, I'm not big on fat people.  She looks like Aleister Crowley.  Ha, ha, look at that.  Oh, yeah, she's a little meaty.  Oh, man.  You're probably drunk.  You'd take that home.  Who does she look like?  Steven Tyler.  There you go.  No, she looks like fucking... 
[00:17:30]  She looks like Pyle from Full Metal Jacket.  Holy shit, with long black hair.  Block her face out in that picture.  She looks like fucking Leonard Lawrence.  Oh, shit.  It's Leonard Lawrence.  Hey, here's a guy that saw Evolution.  Let me see what this is about.  Oh.  Let's go to St. Louis.  Good old St. Louis.  Tom, what's going on?  Not too much.  I saw Evolution about a year ago in a place called House of Rock.  And they actually advertised that it was a tribute band.  When did all this go on? 
[00:18:00]  Yeah, that was, well, a year ago, of course.  This was like a one-off.  This was one time they just had a promoter tell them, come in.  We're going to, you know, fly and then bus you guys in, play this gig, and then just leave.  Like, they didn't have to do anything but play.  So they didn't know it had been set up where the guy didn't exactly say it was Journey, but he didn't say it wasn't.  And then rumors were leaked out and shit like that to the point where it got back to Neil Sean, who was like. 
[00:18:30]  That's unbelievable.  So it got back to Neil Young.  Oh, wait a minute.  You sure Hugo didn't know?  He's a smart dude.  You know something?  I don't know.  That's just the story.  He must have thought something was amiss.  That's the story I heard from a very reliable source.  All right.  Yeah.  All right.  The same thing kind of went on with a band called Cemetery Gates out of Peoria, Illinois.  Pantera.  Bashed the hell out of them.  Really?  That was about, I want to say, six, seven months ago.  We were playing, I used to do actually lights and backup vocals because Journey is a very, you know, harmonic band. 
[00:19:00]  And, of course, you know, Hugo could sing and my brother could sing.  But that was pretty much it in the band.  And they needed massive three-part harmonies to do the gig.  And it wasn't like nowadays where you could just digitally fucking pop it in.  So I did the lights for the band.  But I also had a headset mic on.  And I would do the third harmony on the songs. 
[00:19:30]  This was back, yeah, back in the old days, in the 80s.  And so we were doing a gig upstate.  I can't remember where the fuck it was.  But we went out that night and there was a buzz around because of Hugo that Journey was playing this gig.  It was an intimate, small gig like that.  So we actually went to this roller rink just to hang out and have a few beers and put some skates on and do some drunk roller skating to laugh.  Yeah.  And we got fucking, like, mobbed to the point where I was like, wow, this is cool. 
[00:20:00]  Some girl comes over and asks me to go out on a little moonlight skate with her.  And I was like, well, I can't skate very well.  She goes, oh, I'll hold you.  She's holding me.  And then we were back in the club just fucking making out in the fucking band car and shit.  And then my brother bangs on the door.  And he's got some girl and he's pissed that he can't use the car.  And I was just like, fuck you.  So all of us wound up just leaving that skating rink with girls. 
[00:20:30]  And then she gives me a gold necklace, a gold chain before I left.  Right.  Because, dude, they thought we were fucking Journey.  Right.  They thought we were.  I had a big afro.  I could have been Neil Sean.  Who knows?  That's awesome.  So we go back home and I wound up giving the gold chain to my girlfriend as a present.  What a scumbag.  What a genius.  What a different take I had.  Oh, it was different times back then.  Different times.  Back then in your 30s. 
[00:21:00]  In my 30s.  Fuck you.  I was in my very, very youthful late teens, early 20s.  Damn.  Very good.  All right.  Let's go to Brian in Illinois.  Brian.  Hey, what about Brian Johnson?  It's a Cal Basie cover band.  ACDC with Brian Johnson.  Yeah.  Take over for Bon Scott.  Yeah.  They did pretty well.  It's also not a cover band and Bon Scott was dead.  It's like when a guy dies, it's like when, you know, Ozzy got kicked out of Sabbath. 
[00:21:30]  They went to D.O.  Bon Scott died.  There's a different mentality, especially when a guy dies.  I mean, it's like the band is not trying to motherfuck you.  It's like, hey, look, it's either the end of things for good or we continue.  Yeah.  You look at something like The Who.  Jesus Christ.  But they did get the voice pretty good.  He wasn't doing, but Brian Johnson was not doing a Bon Scott impression at all.  Right, right.  He was having new material.  Yeah.  And it was good material.  Yeah.  Good stuff.  Well, I still prefer Bon Scott.  I mean, you know, I'll talk to anybody at Buddy Booth about that.  Oh, I bet you will. 
[00:22:00]  Thank you, Brian.  Has anyone even heard of Steve Perry?  Can he sing as good as the new lead singer of Journey?  I've heard.  Cornell, I think his name is.  Oh, Jesus.  Thanks for that image there.  Thanks for the cock shot.  What a cock shot.  A Bon Scott.  Yeah.  That's Bon Scott.  Yeah.  Wearing tight, tight, ridiculous tight jeans and no shirt.  And he has a fucking softball in his pants.  He's all bagged, that kid.  He's all bagged. 
[00:22:30]  There's nothing on the other side of the zipper.  What's that about?  Nothing, dude.  He's got one big fucking ball and nothing on the other side of the zipper.  That's a complete defensive shift.  Right.  I haven't heard any Steve Perry shit of late.  Is there anything?  Did he release anything lately?  He would think he would have been out there doing something.  Is there anything live of him on YouTube?  I bet he just doesn't sound that good anymore.  I've heard that, yeah, he was losing his pipes.  I mean, but he's no kid anymore.  And that's probably why he's not really fighting the whole Journey thing.  Maybe, maybe.  Who the fuck knows? 
[00:23:00]  Let's go to Dan in Knoxville.  Dan.  Hey, you guys.  Hey.  I haven't heard anybody comment.  I keep hearing about Journey.  I listened to Journey back before Perry even came along with the keyboard player.  You know, was the lead singer.  Yep.  Oh, that's rock and roll music there.  It just kind of went like bubblegum pop, like when Perry took over.  You're right.  You're right.  But I think when the keyboard player, what the fuck was his name?  I don't even know.  But when he was singing and then Steve Perry was doing backups. 
[00:23:30]  Oh, that was great.  That was really fucking good.  All right, wait a minute.  What was that?  Same way?  Wait, when the keyboardist was singing for Journey, did they have a hit song on the radio?  Yeah.  Oh, yeah, two of them.  Which ones?  It was great.  That's the same way.  That's the same way you love me?  That's the same way?  Yeah, that's one of them.  Yeah.  And what's the other one, Dan?  You know?  Oh, God.  That's the one I remember most.  Just the same way.  There's one more.  Greg Raleigh.  That was his name.  Oh, good old Greg Raleigh.  Greg Raleigh.  Yeah.  When the both of them were singing together, I got to admit, that was really, really great. 
[00:24:00]  Play a little of Just the Same Way.  Did you see what you were just here?  Yeah, this is the different singer.  And then Steve Perry.  Okay, you can shut up and I think.  Um.  Not again.  You can tell.  He doesn't have the range that Steve Perry has.  But he sounds good.  And then Steve Perry kicks in.  That's Greg Raleigh.  Yeah, holy crap.  I don't think I ever knew this.  And they can absolutely tell when Perry kicks in. 
[00:24:30]  And when he did, the crowd went bullshit.  They just knew that he was the guy.  And then he takes over a verse.  That's the same way you love me.  What was, what was, uh, what was Steve Perry doing for the band at this point?  I don't know.  Back up vocals and a fucking tambourine.  Well, they pushed him out front and center, huh? 
[00:25:00]  Yeah, yeah.  They just knew from the, I think the crowd reaction was ridiculous.  Because there's a part in this song where he just, like, completely comes up front and takes the song over and owns it.  I didn't know that.  I don't think I knew this.  What was the other song?  I don't know what the other song was.  You know, faggy, but what are you going to do?  Back, back, for some reason, there are some really fag-ass songs that were considered fucking rock back in the 70s.  You would listen to it with your friends. 
[00:25:30]  There was no way you were fucking faggot listening music motherfucker.  But you listen now and go, those are some faggy-ass songs that we were, like, rocking.  There are a lot of REO Speedwagon fans out there.  Not many admit it these days.  No, not many of you guys are going to admit it now, are you?  Journey, it's kind of easy to still admit that.  Number one fag song that rocked, Ride in the Storm Out.  That's from Kevin from Connecticut.  Holy shit.  I'm in.  You would play it and crank it.  Fag songs that rock. 
[00:26:00]  Dude, fag songs that rock.  What makes it a fag song?  They rock.  They're just now, if you listen to it, you go, I wouldn't fucking play this in front of my friends because they think I'm a faggot.  But back then, you cranked it and your friends were like, yeah, fuck it.  And not faggy rock guys.  You are fucking hardcore rock guys listening to this fag shit.  I smell bit.  Let's go.  Come on.  Here we go.  Fuck Freedom Rock.  Play a little of that one.  Fag songs that rock.  Play a little of that one.  Let's go to Mike in Boston.  Was that REO? 
[00:26:30]  Mike in Boston, go ahead real fast.  Good morning, boys.  Hey, Mike.  One, there is a tribute band in Boston called Draw the Line.  And the lead singer is the soft on the microphone.  He's got the big lips and he's real skinny.  He's good.  Just like Steven Tyler.  Saw them.  Yeah, we saw them.  Really fucking good.  You did?  Yep.  Well, can we get a...  Do you guys remember the awful time when Motley Crue tried going on without Vince Neil and  they had a man tour that both bombed with some lead singer?  But nobody can remember his name, can they?  No. 
[00:27:00]  It doesn't work usually.  You know, that's why the journey thing is really pretty unbelievable.  Well, I want to hear a little Ride in the Stormout.  Thank you, Mike.  Because I need...  Yeah.  Here's a memory of what used to be considered...  Fag songs that rock.  Dude.  You sit there and go, yeah, listen to the guitar, man.  Oh.  Ride in the Stormout.  Waiting for the thaw out.  Waiting for the thaw out. 
[00:27:30]  Who sings this?  REO.  REO Speedwagon.  And you're like...  You can't even say REO Speedwagon without thinking Fag.  The big fucking...  Watching for the snow.  I've been thinking maybe what I'm missing in the city.  Here it comes.  Listen to that.  And I'm not missing a fight.  Dude, you'd crank this and be like, I am rocking.  No, you wouldn't.  The end of the storm out. 
[00:28:00]  Come on, everybody.  I'm in my 69 Nova.  Drinking beers with my dirtbag friends.  Thinking we're going to get chicks with five guys with hard-ons.  Driving around.  Where are five girls that are going to fuck us?  Blasting REO out the open windows.  You can barely take care of your own hard-on.  Now you've got to take care of your friend's hard-ons.  It's like, how are we going to get all our hard-ons sucked?  Just broke off our asses.  We all end up at one of our houses. 
[00:28:30]  Wonder why we didn't get chicks.  Playing cards.  You bunch of drunks.  Yes.  Almost.  Oh, God.  How funny is that?  Five guys thinking they're going to need chicks in a shit car.  And it's like, somebody always had the idea, yeah, no, go to the school.  We'll go behind the school where people drink.  And then you wind up getting out of the car.  You go there.  Like, there's two more guys waiting for chicks.  Now you're seven.  It's like a fucking zombie movie.  You just keep picking people up along the way.  So they're there.  You're there. 
[00:29:00]  So you're like, ah, what the fuck?  Let's suck each other's dicks.  You know, you kid, but there were so many places that you'd go to to hope to find, and  maybe you'd find, like, one or two girls that were your friends, and the vultures would just  swoop in on them.  That's ridiculous.  They're not looking to get laid.  They're just looking for a free beer or some shit.  Well, it was awful.  All right, let's move on.  This is fun.  The phones are lit.  Tag songs that rock.  Someone wrote, uh, what the fuck do they write? 
[00:29:30]  Oh, uh, anything by Queen.  Ah, I still like Queen, though, man.  Queen was considered a very rocking fucking band.  How about this one, Fox on the Run?  Fox on the Run?  Who was that?  Ace just redid that.  Really?  Did he?  Yeah.  Was it Fox on the Run by Sweet?  I don't know the original.  Do you have it?  Ah, look at this.  See?  If you got Fox on the Run, you remember this one, Ant.  Fag songs that rock.  Remember this?  They all have to start with the...  It sounds like...  It sounded like Cars. 
[00:30:00]  Yeah.  They're getting a Cars.  Oh, wow.  A lot of keyboards.  A lot of keyboards background.  Oh, yeah.  And the consistent banging of the drum.  This rock.  Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah.  Oh, yeah.  Dude, this rocked.  Is this a fax on that rock, though?  Yeah.  Listen to this.  It wasn't a fax song when we were growing up.  No, no.  Okay. 
[00:30:30]  Yeah.  Hey.  You know what?  I don't mind this song.  If this came on the radio, I wouldn't switch it off.  All right.  This guy's got a really good one.  Brian in Philly doing fax songs that rock.  Hey.  Good morning, O.P.  Anthony, Jimmy.  Hey, buddy.  Good morning.  Fantasy by Aldo Nova.  Aldo Nova.  Would that be?  We got to put a CD together and get a late night commercial.  Fag songs that rock.  That was on BAB, which was the home of rock and roll. 
[00:31:00]  It was the home.  It had to be.  Let's listen to a little Aldo Nova.  Aldo.  A little fantasy.  Here is the guitar, which made it rock.  Come on.  Who didn't air guitar to this?  Aldo Nova.  People are trying to say Blue Oyster Cult, Don't Fear the Reaper.  Fuck no.  Blue Oyster Cult had their phase where they had a couple of hits and stuff, but their other  shit rocked.  Emmy 262.  Stop it.  They rocked.  Listen to this. 
[00:31:30]  It was cool when it came out.  What do you think?  Yeah, this was bad.  Anytime a singer rhymes lights with bright, it's an awful song.  But it rocked.  Yeah.  It rocked.  How about Radar Love?  Would you consider that?  No, that rock.  Yeah.  That still has a place in rock history.  I don't think.  I don't know.  I still like it.  Yeah.  We're picking up the same exact song over and over here.  You know what it is, though?  I think that had, like, the guy's voice was good.  He had that gravelly, raspy thing. 
[00:32:00]  It didn't have any kind of hokey part in it.  It wasn't really keyboard-filled.  That's just a rock song, I think.  Who wants to call it, too, by the way?  Songs that Fuck Dharma sang were always the hits, and those were the ones that were a  little faggy.  The ones that Eric Bloom sang, which was the majority.  That was 99% of the songs Eric Bloom sang, and those were the ones that rocked for the  time.  I'm trying to think of one of his songs.  Psychic Wars. 
[00:32:30]  What the hell was it?  Godzilla.  Oh, he did Godzilla?  Yeah, yeah.  All right.  Yeah, all those.  He didn't do Burn It For You.  No, no.  Burn It For You.  Another one that was, yeah.  How about Renegade by Sticks?  Anything by Sticks is fag rock.  Anything by Sticks.  Because, dude.  There it is.  You didn't think this was fag.  Fag songs that rock.  I could do the voiceover for this, I think.  When you heard this come on the radio?  Yeah.  Cranked!  I still like this.  And you wouldn't roll the windows down not feeling embarrassed. 
[00:33:00]  You look at the guy next to you in his piece of shit car and nod.  Yeah.  Fuck.  Yeah.  Kevin from Connecticut's got the next one after we listen to this for a few more seconds.  You gotta get the big rock puck.  It's got the rock scream.  Right.  And then the big fucking rock intro.  But this is kind of faggy right here, right?  Faggy.  Yeah.  And we don't mean fag like suck someone's dick.  Now look.  We've been using fag and fag and our whole lives and didn't know what homosexuality was about. 
[00:33:30]  Rocking.  But, you know, you say you're listening to Styx because you want to rock.  Right.  People are going to smack you in your fruity face.  Yeah.  This is a perfect example of fag songs that rock.  Yep.  Kevin from Connecticut's got...  Oh, where the fuck did it go now?  Lunatic Fringe by...  Lunatic Fringe by Red Ryder.  I gotta explain something that we're getting into an area with, and I think Aldo Nova fit into that. 
[00:34:00]  The 80s are a different story, I think.  There were still fag songs that rocked by certain bands, but if you're looking at New Wave and that kind of, like, punky thing that was going on...  Listen to the whistle.  I know.  That's different than rock songs that are faggy.  Yeah, but this wasn't part of, like, the New Age thing.  The New Age thing.  No, the, like, New Wave pop.  No.  No?  Not really.  Lunatic Fringe.  They sold us as a rock record when it came out.  Yeah?  Oh, yeah.  A lot of synthesizer. 
[00:34:30]  That's a rock fucking sound right there.  A lot of synth.  That's rock right there.  Yeah.  Les Allen goes, good job connecting with your younger demo.  I'm 22.  This blows.  We don't have a younger demo.  Someday you'll look back at your music and think it was faggy.  What is this?  This is Red Ryder.  Lunatic Fringe. 
[00:35:00]  I don't know if I've ever heard this.  This is a cool song, actually.  Let's see.  What other songs?  We're showing us faggum.  Prime example.  Thank you.  Who's that?  Not Gerger.  I have no idea what your name is.  Brian Adams.  Brian Adams was considered rocking.  And it's just fag music.  No.  I won't give you Brian Adams.  Yes.  No.  Horrible.  He's great.  Horrible.  Come on.  You don't like Brian Adams?  No.  I hate Brian Adams. 
[00:35:30]  You don't?  I hate him.  Heaven's a good song.  No.  Do you ever hear him sing acapella?  No.  It's very good.  Yeah.  After the unplugged.  Yeah.  Someone could be talented, but it's still faggy.  I fucking...  Is Summer of 69's a great tune?  No.  Ah.  Come on.  It's a story.  I'm telling my story.  I love stories.  No, I hate them.  Where are we at with Billy Squire?  Rape Kids Got the Stroke.  Oh, this is okay.  Now, this is supposed to rock.  Now, you've got to remember, we're talking about what rocked then, but now when you play 
[00:36:00]  it, it's faggy.  You can't blast this in your car and look at people and go, I'm rocking.  I'm rocking.  Back when this came out, you absolutely could.  But I never thought this was like one of those rocking songs.  I always thought Brian Adams was a certain kind of like a softer rock.  I never considered him anything like that.  This is supposed to rock.  Brian Adams was supposed to rock.  This was supposed to rock.  Absolutely.  Yeah.  What about Flirting with Disaster, Molly Hatchett? 
[00:36:30]  No, that's just...  That's all right.  That's genre.  What about Def Leppard, Love Fights?  Def Leppard was considered extremely rocking.  Yeah.  I put them more in the dated music category than fag now.  Like, there's Mr. Roboto.  Oh, Jesus.  Pull out your copy.  That's a great one.  Mr. Roboto.  Mr. Roboto.  I still like that song, too.  All right. 
[00:37:00]  You know something?  I don't think this was ever considered fucking rock.  No, no.  Now that I think about it.  This was after Styx started going.  I'm like, people started going, I don't think I can listen to Styx anymore.  This is the other definition of the word fag right here.  They're not rocking anymore.  No.  I have to stop telling people I listen to Styx.  Right.  Yeah, this is when they did that.  This is a fucking Broadway show.  Who are you kidding?  Yeah, and I'm looking at some of the calls.  Like, Rob from Jersey is saying Danger Zone from Top Gun.  That was Europe, I believe. 
[00:37:30]  No, that was, what's his name?  He did Amalek, Caddyshack, and shit like that.  Oh, Kenny Loggins.  Kenny Loggins.  I was thinking Final Countdown.  Sorry about that.  Kenny Loggins, Bob Seger.  Those guys were considered rock guys.  Bob Seger you could still crank up.  Eric Bolton.  Oh, Eric Bolton.  Michael Bolton was a rock guy.  Michael Bolton?  Michael Bolton.  Now you're crazy.  Early, early Michael Bolton was a rock guy.  Name one Michael Bolton song that was considered a rock song back in the day. 
[00:38:00]  I can't name it, but I know there is one.  I don't think so.  Yes, you would listen to Michael Bolton and be like, Michael Bolton's rocking.  And then he went all fag.  I think it failed.  Listen to this.  This was never a rock song.  It's good, though.  Modern man.  You don't say modern.  I am a modern man.  I've got a secret.  Yeah.  What are you hiding?  It's a toe-tapper.  My blood is boiling. 
[00:38:30]  Boiling.  It's a fucking Broadway number, though.  It really is.  You can picture this whole thing on a stage.  This is where you might have started rolling your windows up and turning it down a little bit.  I would always leave it on, but the windows would go up.  Rolled up a little.  Yeah, even though it's 100 degrees out and your AC's not working anymore, someone catches  you singing and you make believe you're yawning.  Yeah.  You know how you know that you're fucking finished when you're dating a much younger chick, which  let's be honest, we all understand that, and she hears something you kind of like, 
[00:39:00]  and she looks at you like, what the fuck is wrong with you?  And you're like, oh.  I always go, it gets nostalgic.  Yeah, you know.  It's getting embarrassed.  How about, um, this is terrible.  Well, Danny's playing the video at the same time.  Oh, wow.  Holy shit.  Oh, my God.  Is that the video?  Yes.  Mr. Roboto is...  There's nothing rock and roll about this.  No.  I've never seen this.  Look at Mr. Roboto.  Oh.  Oh, God. 
[00:39:30]  He looks like Bob Kelly.  You know what, Dan?  Tell me a regatta.  You got your thank you.  You got your Japanese.  Boom.  You got your miso soup.  I am the margarine man.  Margarine man.  You know what, dude?  You got a secret.  You got your coffee.  You're margarine.  Boom.  You're margarine.  You're margarine.  How about cheap trick?  Cheap trick?  Dream police.  I want you to want me.  The boo police. 
[00:40:00]  The boo police.  But is this fag rock?  No.  When you listened...  Mr. Roboto.  Yeah.  No, they didn't...  They rock.  They rock.  Now fag.  Oh, I thought...  Okay.  How about Greengrass and High Tides?  Forever.  Genre.  The genre.  That's not...  You can't put southern rock into...  All right.  Who's not enjoying this a little bit?  Yeah, but it's...  Yeah.  But this is...  We got off course.  This was never a rock song.  I agree.  I'll give you a... 
[00:40:30]  This song basically broke up the band.  This is when they went...  Yo, dude.  If you want to do that Broadway shit, you might want to go find some other guys.  I'll give you a southern rock band that we listened to that was completely fag.  I believe...  Fag now.  What was the one with the flute?  Marshall Tucker?  Sure.  Yeah, Marshall Tucker was a band you would listen to and that was like if you were into  southern rock, it rocked.  But now you listen with a flute.  I can't even remember a Marshall Tucker song right now.  Can't you see? 
[00:41:00]  Can't you see?  That was their ballad though.  Yeah.  That's right.  Did they ever have a rock song?  I don't know.  They were a little fruity.  Anybody?  Look down on your screen.  Marshall Tucker.  What was the Marshall Tucker rock song?  I am the margarine man.  I'm going to say margarine all day.  Margarine.  You know what, dude?  You got a secret.  A secret, secret.  Your secret's safe for me, dude.  Dude, you know what?  I'm trying to lose weight.  I am the margarine man. 
[00:41:30]  You're dead.  Thank you very much, Mr. Cook.  How about My Sharona by the Knack?  That's another one that's kind of, that was supposed to be fucking new wave.  One of the biggest fucking songs when we were growing up.  Yeah.  How about Loverboy?  Loverboy, that's a perfect example.  Thank you.  Working for the weekend?  Dude, you rocked.  When that came on, you cranked it. 
[00:42:00]  You're rocking.  Not embarrassed in front of your friends.  And now?  Oh, it's tough.  You kill Roy, dude.  You know what?  Boom.  You got your margarine man.  You got kill Roy.  Boom.  Nothing better than stupid Bobby.  For years, I've been watching him just pontificate his rehearsed thoughts.  That is great.  Yeah.  Loverboy, you would listen to, yeah. 
[00:42:30]  This is like, yeah, it's Friday.  Yeah.  Fag rock.  Fag rock.  Because growing up, when this came on, when it first came out, you never questioned that  anyone was going to think you were a fag for listening to this.  You were rocking.  You were rocking.  You were rocking.  Now, if you're playing this and listening, and believe me, there are songs that came  out the same time this came out that you could blast, and people are still saying, 
[00:43:00]  he's rocking.  If you had a barbecue 20 years ago, and people are coming, you know, around your house with  their beer.  With their fucking cases of beer in the backyard.  And this is cranking your backyard, people are like, all right, we're all ready to rock.  Hey, the Cox Brothers are here.  Yeah, come on, sit down, man.  Fast forward 20 years.  Yeah, hey, let's go curry.  Play this next summer when you're having one of your pool parties.  Yeah.  See if you'll get the same reaction.  Your friends will come around, and they'll be looking for the glory holes in your bathroom.  What about Jukebox Hero? 
[00:43:30]  Foreigner.  I wouldn't say that's fag rock, though.  More dated.  Another storyteller.  Boy, you would love your stories.  Why, it's a jukebox?  Yeah, the guy's got a story.  There's a story there.  He wanted to be a jukebox hero.  He became one.  It got to him, dude.  He killed himself.  A little jukebox hero.  I don't even like Foreigner.  I think that their love songs are childlike.  Yeah, Loverboy had every hit that they had, rocked at the time, fag now.  Yeah, not good. 
[00:44:00]  How about 38 Special?  Thank you, David from Denver.  38 Special was rocking.  A little genre thing going on.  Like, if you're into Southern rock, you could still get away with listening to it.  And, you know, I wouldn't say you could sit there and go, boy, I'm rocking.  38 Special, what do they used to say about them?  The poor man Skinner or something like that?  Or the pop version of Skinner?  Oh, my God.  We're all working for the weekend. 
[00:44:30]  Come on.  Look at the video.  What's his name?  Reno?  What was his name?  Mike Reno.  Mike Reno wearing his headband and red leather.  Oh, what?  He's working for the weekend.  And the keyboard player has, like, a fucking sarcophagus of equipment he's playing.  And then the guitar player with the mullet looks like David Letterman with a mullet.  Oh, shit, he does.  Very good.  A young David Letterman.  A young David Letterman with a mullet.  God, this is terrible.  Horrid.  People are trying to shove Rush into this category.  No, no, no.  Come on. 
[00:45:00]  There are people that will listen to Rush and still rock.  Fucking no.  Neil Perk's one of the best rock drummers ever.  You can't say that.  Deep Purple, Highway Star.  No.  Deep Purple still rocks.  No, see, I think we've nailed it.  I mean, yeah.  It's a tight niche.  It's a tight niche of songs that you would go, yeah.  Don't try to swerve.  It's kind of faggy now.  How about, I don't know if you, would you classify Beat It?  Is that at one point?  Not Michael Jackson?  But at one point, in 83, 84, man, that was being played everywhere by everybody. 
[00:45:30]  Or do you think it was never considered that?  You could still play it, too.  And you're not going to be chastised by everybody.  No, you won't.  All right, listen, hold on.  1990, you would have been.  93, you would have laughed at.  They're challenging us on Jukebox Hero.  You got to get your name on your fucking instant feedback so you get a little credit.  Do we have that, Travis?  Jukebox Hero.  Jukebox Hero is not fag rock.  It has one of the best build-ups ever, fags.  Yeah.  All right, let's take a listen to this.  You got Jukebox there?  Yeah, anybody there at the seat? 
[00:46:00]  There it is.  At this part.  The build-up is pretty cool in this song.  Yeah.  He's a little...  Standing in the rain.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Couldn't get a ticket.  Could you?  It was a sold-out show.  Was it?  Uh-oh.  I can't wait for the Bob Kelly version.  I'm not kidding.  Just listen closely.  You know what, dude?  It's raining.  The show is sold out. 
[00:46:30]  Don't give an iPod hero.  You know what?  I think I have to agree with you.  It's a feedback.  You can get away with this.  I don't have a problem with this song.  It's a great beat.  The story's hokey, but...  Why?  The guy's outside the sold-out show.  This part stinks.  Right here?  This is a six-string in a second-hand store.  Didn't know how to play it.  Chorus picks it.  That one guitar.  That's good. 
[00:47:00]  All right.  Chris has got it.  We're back on track.  Chris in Boston.  Remember the band Saga?  Saga!  Perfect.  That is a prime example.  We're back on track.  Saga.  Saga rock.  Saga rock.  Now it's got to be considered fag rock.  You cannot.  Give me a little on the loose when you get a chance.  On the loose.  Yeah.  See?  This is perfect.  By the way, let me say something.  I'll still listen to this.  Yeah, well... 
[00:47:30]  Like...  I'll listen to all this shit still.  But not thinking I'm rocking listening to it.  I'm not disillusioned.  Damn it.  You were rocking.  Oh, yeah, you were.  We're back on track, man.  The Chinese writing.  He's got the Chinese writing with the red flag on his chest.  Yeah, the guy looks exactly like Christian Bale.  Yeah.  Oh, my God, he does.  The Chinese...  I see you peeping to yourself.  I am Saga. 
[00:48:00]  Reaching conclusions.  Reaching for something else.  He's wearing knee pads.  This get-up.  And the video makes no sense.  We're...  They interweave a story with live footage.  It was horrible.  We were too young to understand what the knee pads might be representing.  Dude, when this came on MTV, though, you turned it up, you fucking watched it.  And you were rocking.  This is rock.  Yeah.  Oh, bravo, whoever came up with this.  Perfect one. 
[00:48:30]  Look at his dancing.  This is horrendous.  Toodle-dee-doo, toodle-toodle-dee-doo.  A couple coming in.  Found!  Survivor.  Eye of the Tiger.  Oh, yeah.  I don't know.  Was that rock at the time? 
[00:49:00]  Yeah.  Oh, yeah, it was.  It was rocky.  It had fucking rock in the title of the movie.  Yeah.  The story live band is great.  I would...  This on Beavis and Butthead would be hysterical.  What is he doing?  Look at his fucking ball bag.  Look at his bag hanging out.  Hey, Butthead, look at his bag.  Look at his bag.  Look at his bag.  What the fuck is he doing?  He's got some kind of, like, sweats on.  Me how?  Or sweats with, like, gym shorts over him. 
[00:49:30]  I don't know what the fuck he's doing.  He's wearing a jama pants.  He has a deep ass.  He's got just a big ball bag.  Now, some guy's running.  The camera's chasing him.  Steven S. Lebeshore says, who did Sister Christian?  Night Ranger.  Yeah, Night Ranger, Sister Christian.  That's right there.  That rocked at the time.  Now, not so much.  Right.  See, this is where the guitar solo should be.  Yep.  Yeah, motherfucker. 
[00:50:00]  Nice.  I'm rocking.  What about Asia?  You could win Slide Whistle Hero.  Hell yes. 
[00:50:30]  When are they coming out with Slide Whistle Hero?  How about Asia?  That's good.  Asia?  Asia.  Yeah.  Heat of the moment.  Yeah, that rocked at the time.  The super group that was Asia.  This rocked at the time.  Fag rock.  Definitely.  I never meant to be so bad for you.  Ah, yes.  Man Dog 202. 
[00:51:00]  Super Tramp.  Oh, dude.  Fuck.  You would play Super Tramp and it rocked.  Which Super Tramp song?  Let's try to think right now.  On the spot.  The most rocking Super Tramp song.  You couldn't do it.  Their biggest hit.  Take the Long Way Home.  Logical song.  You'd play these though loud at parties.  Wait, give me Super Tramp.  I'll tell you their most rocking song.  Please. 
[00:51:30]  Get a greatest hit or something.  Oh, God.  There's so many good ones coming in now.  Like, what else?  What else?  I'm looking at Super Tramp.  Starship.  Jane by Starship.  Oh, yeah.  That rocked at the time.  Now, if you play anything by Starship, you, I just, you're done. 
[00:52:00]  Yeah.  A little rough.  It's done.  Oh, Bloody Well Right.  Uh, Dreamer.  Oh, you couldn't find a rock in Super Tramp song now that I think about it.  But, but if you threw that on and just played the whole fucking album and blasted it at a party,  no one would say, dude, why are you playing this shit?  Try, uh, Take the Long Way Home.  Yeah.  Horrid.  By Super Tramp. 
[00:52:30]  Yeah, see, because this had the big, another dramatic intro.  It was all about the dramatic build-up intro.  Big, big build-up.  Jocks loved it.  They could just talk right over this.  Oh, fuck.  You can get a weather forecast there.  Yeah.  Weather and traffic.  Going up to about 70 degrees today.  Uh, very happy birthday to Ted Sheckler.  One of those Ted Sheckler, very happy birthday this morning.  A little song by, uh, Super Tramp.  Going to be here rocking with you all day long. 
[00:53:00]  On the rock of, insert your city's name here.  Because they all have a rock of something.  Super Tramp.  Long Way Home.  I'm an eagle.  So you think, you know, bang a party in the picture.  See, this was all right when it came out, but now.  Yeah.  It's a chick song.  It has to be.  I think of this more, again, is this old and dated as opposed to being fruity. 
[00:53:30]  Yeah, but the thing is, it could be that, but it could also be, you played it then, loud.  No one cared.  You play it now loud, you're done.  You can play something loud now and people can be like, ah, what a dated song.  But not think, you're a faggot for listening to it.  This, you are a faggot for listening to.  Fair enough.  I think we did it, huh?  Yeah, that's a good one.  Hey, you guys hear the Goo Goo Dolls doing that Super Tramp song?  No.  Holy shit.  Really?  Travis, what song did they do recently? 
[00:54:00]  Actually, it's a couple years ago now.  I was thinking we'd play a little.  I have no idea.  Really?  It might be a logical song.  A lot of harmonies were very big.  Then you need a big harmonies on the choruses.  High voice, too.  Spectro goes, try Bloody Well Right.  It has rock guitar and then a little opera.  That's a little opera for everybody.  That's what you want.  Europe, the final countdown.  That rocked like a motherfucker.  And now, a little gay. 
[00:54:30]  Was it Give a Little Bit?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  All I have is a live version, if you want to know.  No, I think that's how they did it.  Oh, why is that?  Yeah, check this out as we go to break.  What the hell?  We won't play the whole thing.  The Goo Goo's did Give a Little Bit?  They did an amazing version of this song.  They really did.  Even the fat one?  Yeah.  The Goo Goo they don't pay attention to?  Take a listen to this and we'll be back.  Opie and Anthony.  We'll get into other things after the break.  There's a good article on Tracy Morgan. 
[00:55:00]  Tracy.  One reason I just said that out of nowhere, it's Tracy Morgan's birthday.  It's 41.  Is it?  Yeah.  We'll be there today.  Happy birthday there, Tracy Morgan.  I've got to read this to you, Ann.  So Tracy Morgan for the New York Comedy Festival.  Yeah. 
[00:55:30]  Is he up to shenanigans always?  They booked him at Carnegie Hall.  Oh, shit.  And when you go to Carnegie Hall, you're thinking you're going to see some upscale shit.  A little class.  What the fuck was this?  Some decorum.  Hold on.  It might be on the other page.  Stall it.  I'm stall.  Give me Jimmy's Daily News.  He's not using it.  All right.  Please.  I call it the Daily Snooze.  How funny is that? 
[00:56:00]  Jimmy's coming back in.  You hear about Tracy Morgan?  That is funny, by the way.  I heard that.  Well, I read a bit in the Daily News about the...  How great is it?  I don't know what he did.  Well, this happens all the time.  He played a show at Carnegie Hall for the New York Comedy Festival.  Yes.  And I'm a big fan of 30 Rock.  Any other 30 Rock fans in here?  It's a good show.  No, I never got into it.  But here's the problem.  I watched it.  Tracy Morgan is hilarious on 30 Rock, and he's also hilarious on a comedy stage.  But the problem is, it's very different.  Yeah.  And once again, just kind of like the Bob Saget thing, when Bob Saget first started really showing 
[00:56:30]  everybody that he's a dirty comic, I think I was at the show in the round in that Westbury  place.  I don't know.  It's called something else now.  Some bank center.  And people were going there thinking they're going to see Bob Saget from Full House.  Danny Tanner.  Danny Tanner.  And he's talking about fingering your grandma and shit.  Yeah.  And people were walking out like, what the, what are we, what?  Because they didn't know that this is what he does.  Yes.  Same thing kind of happened with Tracy Morgan at Carnegie Hall.  A lot of these, mostly women, they're saying, you know, they watch the 30 Rock and they're 
[00:57:00]  thinking.  He's so funny on that 30 Rock.  I'm going to go see the colored gentleman at Carnegie Hall.  He probably plays an instrument they normally do.  Thank you.  Yeah, they're thinking they're going to go see Tracy Jordan, which is his character name  from 30 Rock.  So here it is.  Live Tracy, way too racy for some.  And we've all seen Tracy do his thing.  I once saw him just showing, I just, I saw him one time where he was just showing his pubes 
[00:57:30]  in the front row for 20 minutes.  He didn't even do any jokes for a while.  I was in a club though.  It wasn't at Carnegie Hall.  Fans expecting to see Tracy Jordan at Tracy Morgan's Carnegie Hall performance Friday night  got a rude awakening.  The bawdy comedian packed a venerable performance venue with fans expecting his 30 Rock characters,  primetime humor.  But minutes after Morgan's star's routine, many walked out in disgust.  Many.  Many.  It turns out that some New Yorkers really can't take a joke, especially when it's unspeakable  filthy.  People seem to not be laughing at his jokes, but more because they were shocked and appalled 
[00:58:00]  with what was coming out of his mouth.  I would love to see a video of that.  Sniff that booty hole.  Yeah.  Reports one audience member.  Morgan talked trash about homosexuality, saying it's a choice.  Which drew gasps.  Drugs, pornography, and what he calls politics.  Far edgier subjects than what his alter ego, Tracy Jordan, gets airtime for on 30 Rock. 
[00:58:30]  There is a continuous flow of people getting up and leaving throughout the show.  A continuous flow.  Holy shit.  I love it.  Has anybody been listening that was there?  One of our listeners had to have been there.  I hope somebody could call in.  I won't fuck you so you could have my daughter.  Right.  Continuous stream.  Our spy reports adding that many in the crowd clearly didn't know what they were getting  themselves into.  Middle-aged women were the most flabbergasted when he started mimicking explicit sex acts 
[00:59:00]  on stage.  Oh, when he gets down and starts humping the floor.  Yeah, that must have gotten him.  No shit middle.  And here's a prime example of something I bring up every so often.  Middle-aged women seem to have the most problem.  Do you see why I keep my fucking dating pool where I do in the shallow end?  Because the fucking middle-aged women, I'm sorry, and not all of you, don't even call  and say, I'm cool, I'm this, I'm that. 
[00:59:30]  I'm talking averages, percentages.  No, if you're listening to the show, you're already cool.  Yeah, you already got some coolness to you.  Uh, it's that fucking shit that you see, walk in there, you're expecting this guy from TV,  he's not, and instead of sitting and being able to take it in and go, let me see where  the fuck this guy goes.  You got, I've, I'm leaving.  You know how many poor husbands probably got dragged the fuck out while they were laughing?  Right.  Because their wives are like, oh, I will not sit for this.  The one thing I hate seeing is you're at a comedy club, I'm trying to think of a comedian 
[01:00:00]  that happened to recently, where the guy is such a fan of our show, heard the comedian  on our show, he's at Caroline's, and he obviously brings his wife so excited, this is the guy  I was telling you about, and I don't have an example, unfortunately.  I had that happen in Atlanta, where a couple walked out.  So it happens to you, Jimmy, I'm sure.  Out of doubt, like a Susan, I was trashing Susan Boyle, this is before Sharon Osbourne.  Oh my God, I saw that on Entertainment Tonight.  And the couple walked out, and I didn't know they walked out for that reason, but Kenny, 
[01:00:30]  I think Kenny, they walked out after the Susan Boyle, you get that a lot of times.  Yeah, but the guy, he's so into it, and then he gets so depressed because he realizes the  one he loves hates his fucking shit.  Comedian hero there.  Oh yeah.  And then they have to walk out.  Danny put up that, I've seen that too.  Patrice is a fucking prime example of a comic that gets up there, that people knew him  from fucking, you know, when he was doing the web show, and then they know him from some  other TV thing, you know, just know him from other things. 
[01:01:00]  I saw him at a, I think it was at a governor's show on Long Island, and there was this, these  two couples, so, you know, men and their wives, and the wives, and you know how, you know,  relationship heavy Patrice's set can be at times, so, you know, and the women, they don't  like the way he talks about them sometimes, so they were just, like, you know, I don't  know why they feel that they could now talk back to the comic who's performing on stage  like they're having a dialogue.  And Patrice didn't even look them in the face, just looked at the husbands and just goes,  can you take care of this?  And they ended up, they ended up, all four of them left, and then, like, the husband 
[01:01:30]  had to, like, be a tough guy for his wife, because how dare you, you know, insult my wife's honor,  you know, bust back into the comedy club, you know, ten minutes after he was ejected, trying  to be like he was going to fight Patrice and everything.  Sit down, asshole.  The worst.  But you know, he wasn't enjoying the show up until his wife had to get lippy.  You know what it is?  It's not even fucking, yeah, they want to carry on a dialogue, and it's not a conversation.  This is a fucking guy doing his act.  This is a guy doing what he does, going on stage and fucking performing. 
[01:02:00]  It's not open to debate.  Sometimes it's funny if some dopey idiot blurt something out and you nail them back again  and everyone shuts up and they go back to their, you know, their act.  But to fucking, and Patrice, I've seen people just get the fuck up and leave.  Live.  Well, let me, let me get back into this article.  So, so he did the sex acts on stage, the explicit sex acts on stage at Carnegie Hall, by the way.  That's fantastic.  What a great booking. 
[01:02:30]  When Morgan found something shocking, he held on to it for minutes on end.  Some of the controversial jabs he made included a set about the first family.  Obama is really changing the White House because he and Michelle will have the first presidential  sex tape out, he said to a stunned crowd.  Why would that stun anybody, though?  Morgan did better at his second try in politics, saying he wouldn't vote for Mayor Bloomberg  because all he does is go to Yankees games, a gag that seemed to at least draw a hoot from  the crowd.  The comedian has made his name off his eyebrow-raising opinions, most recently recounted his 
[01:03:00]  sordid life story, blah, blah, blah, in this book.  Okay.  No one knew better than Morgan himself that the crowd got more than they bargained for.  At one point Friday night, he addressed shocked showgoers, saying,  You want the clean, Tracy?  Turn on the TV.  Turn on the TV.  You got Tracy Morgan here.  Still not everyone was horrified by the spectacle.  Spike Lee, John Singleton, and rock co-star Jay and Krakowski were all in the audience and  gave a standing ovation.  Of course. 
[01:03:30]  Tracy Morgan is hilarious.  He is very funny.  To see.  I love the way the paper does it, though.  Like they say, a comic like Tracy is a very opinionated guy, but they won't attack the opinions like  for a...  I mean, they shouldn't, actually.  But it's funny with other guys.  They were like, you know, he's a pig or he's...  Right.  Yeah, yeah.  He's terrible.  But they won't do that.  We got someone that was at the Carnegie Hall show.  John in Jersey.  John.  Yeah.  Hi, Chad.  Hey, buddy.  What's happening, man?  It was classic Tracy Morgan, man.  If you didn't know what the hell you were going there for, you shouldn't have fucking gone.  But exactly what you were saying, though, was the wife dragging the fucking husband out 
[01:04:00]  that was all laughing his ass off, and she was all offended and shit, and it was just  a bunch of idiots.  Was there a lot of walkouts?  You know, it came in droves.  It came in droves?  What's it?  It really did.  You know, and then people getting offended.  Like, the white people seem more offended about the Obama sex tape thing than the black  people.  Of course.  Of course.  Oh, yeah.  No surprise there.  They all started looking around like, oh, my God, we're going to get mugged now, you  know, some shit.  No surprise there.  It was fantastic, though. 
[01:04:30]  I was laughing my ass off.  It was great, though.  Because I kept being able to move closer.  I was in the second row by the end of the show.  He just keeps moving up as they're fleeing Carnegie Hall like there's a fire.  40 minutes in, you're his road manager.  By the end of the show, in the second row, he looks at my wife and he's like, I'm going  to get you pregnant.  I want me a white baby.  No shit.  And there goes the rest of the audience.  It's one thing is, they should just put a sign up.  This is a very adult show.  It's like, why don't they just do that to avoid the fucking nonsense?  You know why?  I bet you most people that watch 30 Rock have no idea that Tracy was a stand-up, probably. 
[01:05:00]  Get their money and fuck them.  If they want to walk out, they don't get a refund.  You just put a sign up.  People might not fucking buy tickets or go in.  Good.  Take their money.  All right, John.  Thank you.  Go for Tracy.  Why don't we turn this into our celebrity break, because we got the Sharon Osbourne thing.  The entertainment show is still on our Sharon Osbourne, Susan Boyle thing.  Not one of them said she was trying to be funny. 
[01:05:30]  No, not.  Of course not.  No.  And man, I want to acknowledge the war that's going on in the comments section of the video.  The listeners are fighting a good fight, but the Susan Boyle fans are coming out of the woodwork.  What?  I'll tell you.  If you want to have fun, just read the comments on the video.  It's amazing how differently people think.  Because I'm telling you why.  This is why.  Because Susan Boyle, not that they're huge fans of her, because you can't be.  She's only had one fucking song.  So, by acknowledging, like, yeah, her ugliness was part of her appeal, it's a reveal into the way we look at people. 
[01:06:00]  Nobody wants to realize, like, wow, I thought I was really sensitive to like her.  Because it's like liking her made people feel better about themselves.  Like, that deer, she makes me feel good.  Like, God, there is hope.  And when you look at it, like, you know what?  You're shocked because that ugly bitch is actually making you feel good.  It's an ugly reveal into the way we look at people.  Name an ugly entertainer.  Jim Norton.  There you go.  No, how about this?  Name an ugly singer before Susan Boyle that had huge success. 
[01:06:30]  A chick?  Name a ugly female singer that was very successful before Susan Boyle.  And she's...  Tracy Chapman.  She hasn't been very successful yet.  Tracy Chapman.  Tracy Chapman, ugly.  There's some really...  Depends on what kind of music they're singing.  If you're not trying to be sexy...  Tracy Chapman.  Tracy Morgan's more attractive.  Tracy Chapman?  Horrible looking.  Yeah.  Yeah, she's not pleased.  She's not good at all.  Oh, Jesus Christ.  Well, she's got really short hair, too.  But I'm thinking more, like, singers... 
[01:07:00]  More Susan Boyle-ish.  Yeah, yeah.  You know what I mean?  Like that weird fucking fat or something.  Mama Cass Elliot.  Well, there you fucking go.  She had one of the greatest voices of the time, and no one looked at her going, wow, I want  to bang her.  Uglier than Susan Boyle?  And let's play if you had to.  Fatter.  Let's play if you had to.  I would probably...  If you had to.  I'd take head off of Mama Cass and never touch Susan Boyle.  Mama Cass didn't have good gag reflexes, though. 
[01:07:30]  She's choking on the fucking stage.  Well, apparently, yeah.  She'd probably choke her on the fucking stage.  Is that even true?  It's not an urban legend.  Amy Winehouse we're getting?  Nah, she's not ugly like that, though.  She's ugly sexy.  Yeah.  Right, Jimmy?  Yeah, she's not, like...  Down and dirty.  You know she'll do some dirty things.  Yeah, it's a whorey thing.  You don't look at...  Like, she is just a slob.  You don't look at Susan Boyle and think anything, like, sexy, whore-ish.  Like, you want to just ravage her in bed or fucking punch her in the face or, you  know, whatever you want to do. 
[01:08:00]  But she...  I'm trying to think now.  I think Mama Cass's, like, naughty parts would smell not as bad as Susan Boyle's.  Dude.  You know what a big fucking unshaven 60s muff?  Earth Mama Cass muff she must have had.  Wow.  She was so hungry, she probably fed her pussy with sandwiches.  Yeah, shoved them up there.  I don't even know what that means.  One under each armpit.  No, what happened is she dozed off in a chair and her pussy looks like a horse mouth. 
[01:08:30]  We'll begin just pulling the sandwich off her lap.  Making that sound.  Thank you for punching up my concept, because I didn't even know what I was going for there.  No, Janice...  Someone's saying Janice Joplin, but she was...  She was pretty ugly, but she had this crazy, wild, drugged-out fucking shit thing.  But you guys are bringing up, like, that rock fucking Woodstock-type fucking down-and-dirty shit.  I'm talking about someone that's supposed to kind of look classy on a stage. 
[01:09:00]  Like a Barbra Streisand, like a fucking Celine Dion.  Who sang at 17?  At 17?  That fucking...  Give me a little more and I'll tell you.  Someone will get.  Janice Ian.  Janice Ian.  Janice Ian.  Is that more rock still, or not really?  No, not rock.  That was pretty mellow shit.  Eh, she's got a 70s look to her.  Eh, she's not bad.  It's all right.  I don't know.  I don't know.  Bye.  Guys.  No one can really name her.  No. 
[01:09:30]  A songstress.  A songbird.  She's the ugliest singer ever.  The ugliest songbird ever.  Ugliest songbird ever is Susan Boyle.  And that sexy name, a pus-filled sis.  Fucking...  Your name Boyle.  Aretha Franklin.  Yeah, she was ugly.  She was fat, but diva-ish.  And I hate even putting her...  I hate that word, but...  You see, we're having a tough time here.  Sandy Kane.  No, but when Susan Boyle walked out...  No, people.  When Susan Boyle walked out, everybody... 
[01:10:00]  The thing that makes people bothered is that there's a really weird shame when we realize  I really did expect nothing out of that fucking woman because she was ugly.  Right.  It's a self-reveal.  That's how our society thinks right there.  That's why before any other clips are played, I try to find the original clip of her walking  out on that stage because you could hear the gasps.  Yep.  And the laughter and everything.  So let's see what that was...  Because you don't see that now.  No.  Now she comes out and there's applause and everything. 
[01:10:30]  I want to see that first clip and hear the audience when she first walked out on stage  and look at all the faces of the judges because it was the same bullshit and that was only  because of the way she fucking looked.  Yep.  And what?  Things have changed?  No.  That moment was the most...  That was honest.  Thank you.  And they appreciated her singing.  Yes.  But that...  Oh, God.  There should have been no fucking...  Why should there have been shock that an ugly woman was a good singer?  Yeah.  Doesn't make sense.  Yep.  I mean, I'm shocked, too.  I expected nothing out of that fucking wildebeest.  Of course.  I think so, yeah. 
[01:11:00]  All right.  Because this is when she first walks out.  Yeah, this is the...  Some of the music.  All right.  What's your name, darling?  My name is Susan Boyer.  Okay.  Susan...  They're laughing.  I am from Whitewood, near Bathgate, West Lothian.  That's a big town.  It's a sort of collection of...  It's a collection of...  Villages.  I have to think there.  Yeah.  And...  Like the Shire.  I am 47.  Fucking Hobbit. 
[01:11:30]  They're laughing.  Why are they laughing?  That's just one side of me.  All right.  Now, the judges...  She just did, like, this roundy, round hip thing, and the judges made ugly, disgusting,  like, stop it faces.  What's the dream?  I'm trying to be a professional singer.  And why hasn't it worked out so fast?  She's a girl...  She looks like...  Pause, pause, pause.  They go to the audience, and there's a bunch of girls, but one in particular is rolling her  eyes, like, oh, yeah, right.  She rolled her eyes and made this...  You're too ugly to be a singer.  Thing with her mouth.  She's actually what she's thinking. 
[01:12:00]  Why?  The show is called Britain's Got Talent.  So why is that...  I mean, we all know why, but if we're being honest as a group, that's how everyone felt.  Right.  This is the honesty before the fucking song came out.  And no one is ever disputing she doesn't have talent.  No one's saying that.  Right.  They're just saying she's pig fucking ugly, and that's everybody's reaction before one  note comes out of her mouth.  And in that fucking reaction, and then all of a sudden, we were shamed, and I say we,  the collective we, were fucking shamed by the fact that she was really good, and it's 
[01:12:30]  an ugly fucking reveal into how we just judged her on her ability to sing by just being a  fat, ugly, frumpy bitch.  So why are these talk show idiots just discounting that?  They're not even acknowledging that that happened, that that was a moment before she opened her  mouth and started singing, where everybody was looking going, oh my God, what is this  animal doing on this stage?  Because none of us like that ugliness in our own, our shallowness.  I love it!  Well, that's because it's all you have from hat to shoes. 
[01:13:00]  It's just one long act of judgmentalness.  But you know what I mean?  It's like, nobody as a group likes that ugly shit reveal, that fucking, like, God damn,  I really am that person.  Let's go back to the clip.  I want to see what else is here.  She rolls her eyes.  So far, Susan?  I've never been given a chance before, but here's hoping it'll change.  Okay, and who would you like to be as successful as?  Elaine Page.  Elaine Page.  What are you going to sing tonight?  More faces.  Oh, wait, pause.  She goes, she's no, what did she say? 
[01:13:30]  She's no Ellen Page.  Is it Ellen Page?  Something like that.  The reactions in this video are just amazing.  The crowd reactions.  Go ahead.  Okay?  I think so.  They're all laughing.  The judge is laughing.  They're laughing backstage.  Now they're waiting for a nightmare.  I dreamed a dream in time no more. 
[01:14:00]  I hate the judge's reactions.  Because they already know she was a good singer.  Did you just imagine that, did you?  Did you?  No.  Why not?  Why?  Even the dumb guy backstage said, you didn't expect that, did you?  More.  More.  Because she's a fucking ugly cunt.  She's a fucking ugly cunt.  Why are they giving her a standing ovation?  Because they didn't expect this mess to sound like that.  This says it all.  This clip.  When dreams are made and used and wasted. 
[01:14:30]  Nas ass.  Thank you, Nas, lady.  Show the back view.  Yoo-hoo, sheriff.  Pulling toilet paper out of someone's ass.  Oh, one guy didn't like it.  All right.  Enough, I guess.  You get the point.  Yeah.  They fucking lost their minds.  And these fucking little fruity entertainment people.  How about going to the end now, where they comment on her singing and see if there's 
[01:15:00]  any revealing things about what they say.  Could you do more of the guy backstage, please?  Look at her.  Look at her.  She's fucking horrible to even look at.  But she sings like a fucking bird, the cunt.  Oh, she's ghastly.  Fucking ghastly.  You weren't expecting that, would you?  You weren't expecting that out of such a fucking pig. 
[01:15:30]  She's a fucking pig.  Don't be disgusting fucking pig, cunt.  But we're assholes in Sharon Osbourne.  She's an asshole, right?  Yeah, she's mean.  Yeah, yeah.  All right.  Just because she said what everyone was thinking.  Yep.  And she did it to be fucking funny.  Great talent, but she was hit with the ugly stick.  Yes.  The fucking ugly stick.  Perfect.  Fucking ugly stick.  Perfect comedic timing.  Yeah, she was hilarious, by the way.  Perfect.  Now, she's done.  Let's see what the judges say. 
[01:16:00]  It's the standing ovation.  Oi!  Hello.  Hello.  Come back here.  Get your fucking ugly ass back out there.  You fucking, you hooved animal.  You clever, you hooved animal.  Look at you.  Where's your girly tail, you fucking ugly cunt?  Another observation.  She finished her song, and she knows she's just an ugly mess, and she just walked away.  She's skulking off like she's used to doing it in every situation, when she's just denied 
[01:16:30]  anything because she's ugly.  Exactly.  She walked off stage immediately.  They had to tell her to go back out there.  Get back.  Turn around, you fucking heifer.  Turn around, you hoax.  Turn the fuck around.  Not that I could tell looking at your arse or your face.  Oh, she was walking the other way.  I thought your arse was your face, you ugly fuck.  You cut, you. 
[01:17:00]  Oh, shit.  You're a woven hood animal.  You're a woven hoof.  Kevin from Connecticut.  You smelly bitch.  Kevin fucking Connecticut writes, she looks like a child's drawing of herself.  A child's drawing of herself.  That's perfect.  Oh, God.  Fucking Kevin.  All right, now the comments from the judges. 
[01:17:30]  That was the biggest surprise I have had.  All right, pause.  Obviously, we've got to keep pausing.  Why was it the biggest surprise ever?  Why?  Why?  If there was some pretty girl that walked out there, they would not say that's the biggest  surprise.  They would be like, wow, that is an amazing job.  And that's what we totally expected from you.  All right, hold on, hold on.  Because you're so hot.  Quick, quick fucking detour.  Chuck Norris' wig.  Holy shit.  All right, all right.  Chuck Norris is on Fox. 
[01:18:00]  He's on Fox and Friends or Fox whatever.  It's a road to socialism.  I guess he's doing some political commentary.  His wig is, there is not a color on the spectrum that that wig is.  What the fuck is he doing?  No, it's kind of like a red purple.  Yeah, I'm an expert.  Looks good.  Let's say, hey, that's a good one, Chuck.  Can't even karate kick at all.  It's a reddish, like, it's soy sauce again.  Oh my God, it could be the worst one ever.  What is he doing?  It doesn't look natural with any part of his body. 
[01:18:30]  His skin tone, his mustache, his eyebrow, everything.  Who's, I mean, I'm trying to find Chuck Norris.  Who's the guy with the shiny hat?  His head must be cold.  And then he's got his other hair hanging out the back, which doesn't match.  He was just fucking Hadley last night when I was doing reddish.  I forgot he was there.  I should have stuck around and meet him.  Oh my God, yeah.  You're Chuck Norris.  Go balls.  I know.  Worse than Fez's wig.  Worse than Fez's wig.  Absolutely.  Absolutely.  Good one, Chuck. 
[01:19:00]  All right, let's get back to Susan Boyer.  Yeah, looks good.  Yeah.  You polished that wig.  Yeah.  Walker, Texas wig.  Hides his guns under there.  Yeah, take it to a car wash.  Puff it.  Jay in Texas saying you sound like Shrek with Tourette's Syndrome, man.  Okay, well.  Pretty good.  Let's get back to Susan Boyer.  I want to see all the surprises.  By the way, the other thing, we'll take inside this.  These guys already knew that she had an amazing fucking voice and they had gold on their hands. 
[01:19:30]  Simon Cowell owns the show and his reaction is like, that surprise reaction, he's a good  actor because it looks pretty real, but he already knew what she sounded like.  They knew it was going to be this giant reveal of this ugly woman with a beautiful voice and  that's what they played off of it.  So why would Sharon get shit for saying what's that?  You don't think all the producers and the behind the scenes people aren't talking to  Simon and are like, wow, you're not going to believe what we found this season.  Look at this.  They probably went, look at this picture.  Oh, God.  And then it's like, and here's her singing.  Oh, yeah.  Of course. 
[01:20:00]  Of course.  Oh, perfect.  Wild horses.  Shut up, piggy.  Why would she pick wild horses to sing?  I know.  It's an animal she fucking weighs less than.  All right.  Wait a minute.  You did it me.  No, I didn't.  Wait.  It's an animal she weighs less than.  Yes, because she's so fat.  Oh, okay.  All right.  So she picked an animal.  She wanted to find an animal that she wasn't as heavy as and wild horses was where she had  to go.  Well, not a great joke, but consistent. 
[01:20:30]  But a skinny girl could say the same thing.  She weighs less than a wild horse.  Yes, but that wouldn't be.  But she could say that with a lot of smaller animals, too.  Yeah.  Susan Boyle had to wait till she got to horses to find an animal that she weighed less than.  Like, if you put that joke and a feather, the feather would have more substance and comedic  value.  Too bad the Stones didn't write wild brontosaurus.  It might have been better.  That would have been a gem.  Yes.  Too bad they wrote a song at all, because then I had nothing to say if they didn't.  Fucking.  Oh, my finger slipped. 
[01:21:00]  It certainly did.  Fuck.  All right.  Let's get back to the judges on Susan Boyle.  Three years on the show.  When you stood there with that cheeky grin and said, I want to be like a lame page, everyone  was laughing at you.  No one is laughing now.  Why?  That was stunning.  Why?  Why were they laughing at her?  They didn't laugh at the other fucking.  No.  Did they laugh at other contestants when they said that they wanted to be. 
[01:21:30]  No.  They all know they wanted to be famous.  Why did Sharon get all this shit for being real?  Because people don't break it down like this.  It's like, this is why you have to be belligerent with these fucking little jerk-off entertainment  shows.  You have to go, well, where's the fucking fat girls on your show?  Yeah.  You're all fucking beautiful people holding you.  Shut the fuck up.  Yeah, wait till you hear what they said about it last night.  Why don't they call out this judge?  Why don't they call out Simon?  Why don't they call them all happy and say, you know something?  She was prejudged on her looks.  And after she sang, they thought, wow, what a beautiful voice. 
[01:22:00]  But that doesn't change anything in the way she looks.  The initial reaction to her was she's fucking ugly.  And we expect nothing out of her.  You think she's getting cocked now that she's famous?  I hope so.  There's probably fetish people that like that.  Yes.  They're called bestiality fans.  You beast of burden.  Come here, you beast of burden.  Your answer was, there's probably fetish people out there.  Still just beating her down.  You don't think there was one legitimate guy that said, you know what? 
[01:22:30]  No.  She's beautiful on the inside?  No.  All right, let's get back to this.  Oh, my cross is too young.  Amazing.  I'm reeling from shock about you two, but...  I am so thrilled because I know that everybody was against you.  I honestly think that we were all being very cynical, and I think that's the biggest wake-up call ever.  And I just want to say that it was a complete privilege listening to that. 
[01:23:00]  It was interesting.  Not looking at you.  Yeah.  But listening.  You've got a face for radio.  Here's Simon.  On that stage, that we were going to hear something extraordinary, and I was right.  Oh, backstage again, Ant.  Backstage, guys.  Give it to her, Simon, before she takes the dump on the stage, a fucking animal.  Well, okay, moment of truth. 
[01:23:30]  Here's yes or no.  The biggest yes I have ever given anybody.  Wow.  Amanda?  Yes, definitely.  That's brilliant.  I'm a hard time, isn't it?  Susan Boyle, you can go back to the village with your head held high.  It's three yeses.  Oh, God.  Well, don't hang your head high, but hold your head high.  Victory for the fat ugly lady.  Exactly. 
[01:24:00]  That's all it's about.  Look at that.  Now we're giving her a standing ovation.  The fat pig surprised us.  The ugly woman has a pretty voice.  The fat pig entertained us.  I think you enjoyed that just a little.  There's the backstage, guys.  What's her voice?  Incredible.  Congratulations.  Oh, my God.  Congratulations.  Oh, my God.  How do you feel?  Pretty fantastic.  Pierce says that's the biggest yes he's ever given on the show.  In three series. 
[01:24:30]  Yeah.  Oh, my God.  Most extraordinary shock we've ever had.  Just so emotional.  See, most extraordinary shock.  Why?  Fantastic.  Now get back to pulling your fucking plow.  You're a beast.  You're a beast.  What a bloody ugly fucking cunt.  Go back to pulling your fucking plow. 
[01:25:00]  Oh, is that great?  Yeah.  Now one reporter talked about how Sharon Osbourne was on a comedy show when she made those statements.  Thank you for that.  Of course they didn't.  And now one reporter talked about, yeah, maybe what Sharon said was fucking, oh, yeah, it's fucked up.  But the ugliness of everyone's reaction is the real fucking, the reveal into who we are.  It's fucking.  That's the reveal.  Well, so, yeah, so Sharon, you know, said some things on our show, obviously.  On a comedy show.  They were hilarious.  Hilarious.  Most people know by now. 
[01:25:30]  So, uh, the entertainment shows, ah, it's good for us.  Did a little more, a little more material on Sharon Osbourne and the Opie and Anthony show.  It's funny, nobody is saying, how come Sharon said that Bret Michaels has a dose?  Which was a very funny line, but she made fun of Bret, but she made fun of Susan.  Uh, you know, what else?  She, she hit on, uh, fucking.  Jeff Beck.  Jeff Beck.  Jeff Beck, yeah.  She was just fucking, oh, she had a machine gun.  She was just being funny.  But no one's talking about Jeff Beck these days, so why would they put it on, put it on, uh, entertainment shows?  So here's Inside Edition last night, reporting on the latest, uh, on the Sharon Osbourne controversy. 
[01:26:00]  If Susan Boyle is offended by what Sharon Osbourne's been saying about her, she's not showing it.  Singer Susan Boyle arrives at Los Angeles International Airport for her big...  This is, we are the biggest fucking dicks in entertainment because they had to hunt down Susan Boyle to get her comment on something that happened on our show.  Well, the thing is, too, the reporters, the first thing they ask her is, how does it feel if somebody called you ugly?  Right, right.  Why? 
[01:26:30]  Swoop in.  Why, why, why would the fucking vultures swoop in and even tell her that if she didn't hear it?  Why?  Why do they need a reaction from her?  Boyle arrives at Los Angeles International Airport for her big appearance this week on Dancing with the Stars.  But it's the showdown between Boyle and Sharon Osbourne that has everyone talking.  What do you think of Sharon Osbourne?  As you may recall, Osbourne shocked the world last week when she trashed Boyle during a satellite radio interview.  You just want to say, God bless and, and here's a Gillette razor. 
[01:27:00]  God doesn't give everyone everything.  Absolutely.  Yeah.  But he gave her the talent.  Yes, yes.  Yes, he did.  Really short-changed around the rest of it.  He came up with a f***ing ugly.  Just to complicate matters, Osbourne's daughter Kelly is one of the five finalists remaining on Dancing with the Stars.  So what did Susan Boyle have to say?  She's taking the high road.  What do you think of Sharon Osbourne?  Hey, she's nice.  Yeah?  Excellent.  Nice lady. 
[01:27:30]  Trying to, trying to stir some, why is the media saying, what do you think of Sharon Osbourne?  Yeah, trying.  Trying to keep that show, you f***ing vultures.  They want to keep it going.  Oh, they try.  I hope they do.  I don't want to keep it going.  That's good for us.  Keeps our clip in the f***ing news.  I don't like the fact that Jim Norton hasn't been sent.  You can hear my laughs.  It's all raucous.  I know.  Sharon Osbourne will be on, well, Susan Boyle will definitely be on Dancing with the Stars tonight.  Kelly Osbourne will definitely be dancing.  And Sharon will possibly be in the audience.  So this story has legs still.  Access Hollywood.  They were the biggest dicks. 
[01:28:00]  Yeah, they stink.  They played their audio yesterday.  Well, they did an online poll.  Of course.  Of course they did.  Time now for AH Nation, where your opinion can be.  What do you think of Sharon Osbourne?  Hey, she's going to be nice.  Yeah?  Excellent.  Wow, Susan Boyle arriving at LAX for her appearance on Dancing with the Stars tomorrow.  And she might be the only person who didn't hear Sharon Osbourne slam her.  Ouch.  God doesn't give everyone everything.  Absolutely.  Yes.  He gave her the talent.  Yes, yes.  Yes, he did.  Really short-cheated on the rest of it. 
[01:28:30]  That's where the f***ing ugly.  But the nation heard the ugly stick slam loud and clear.  Always looking for the positive approach, though.  We asked who is the better looking, Susan or Sharon.  What do you think, Billy?  Oh, please.  Uh, Susan's from the front, Sharon from the back.  Uh, I don't know.  Who got the last laugh?  I'll tell you, Susan did.  Sticking it to Sharon with 68%.  No one thinks that.  No one thinks that.  No, stop it.  What a useless TV show.  It's a useless.  Access Hollywood is a f***ing useless shitheap. 
[01:29:00]  Right, it's useless.  Let's really look at society and...  What are they getting done with that dumb show?  Uh, if the poll was like that, why not then have Susan Boyle host your show?  Yeah.  If 68% thinks she's better looking than Sharon.  And the hosts know that Sharon Osbourne is better looking.  This version of Sharon Osbourne, anyway.  You're a f***ing...  No, even the old version is better than Susan Boyle.  They're all good-looking people mad that somebody made fun of an ugly person.  And yet, not one of those people would have her host their show if she wasn't famous or f*** her. 
[01:29:30]  So, shut your faces!  Yes.  I kick it, man, because the lines are too good on instant feedback.  Vince from Beyond.  She's...  And you've got to read the feedback in your voice.  She's taking the high road pulling a cart.  The f***ing beast.  Beast.  And then someone else is like, it's good to see...  Oh, wait.  Uh, where the f*** is it?  I lost it, whatever.  Just they're happy that this story has legs and we're not getting fired.  Yeah, that is kind of good.  Usually when we're in the news and it has legs, so... 
[01:30:00]  Any kind of f***ing story like that, trouble be brewing.  And then someone else said they chased her down because they wanted to give her the blue ribbon that she forgot at the country fair.  Oh, shit.  So, there you go.  Yeah, you sing great.  You sing great.  Now, go backstage.  We have some ouds for you.  We got ouds for you to eat.  Eat your ouds!  Let's go to Larry King.  Larry! 
[01:30:30]  Ah, Larry.  Yeah, Susan, how important is your voice when you're an ugly cunt?  Oh, Larry.  Larry, come on.  Larry!  That's a damn good question.  Let's go to Mike in New Mexico.  Well, do you think we'll be just as surprised at her acting abilities when she stars in Shallow Hell 2?  Very good.  And I bring up a movie that's...  We're looking at a very...  Is that her picture of Susan Boyle?  Yeah.  Why didn't she make it when she was younger?  Yeah.  She's 47 years old now and it's obvious she has a natural ability. 
[01:31:00]  She wasn't quite as ugly.  Oh, my God.  Who does she look like there?  I can f***ing picture him.  Him?  No.  That's not good.  That's great.  Norm Macdonald?  No.  The guy that was on Perfect Strangers.  I can't remember his name.  Him?  That's never good.  God damn it!  Somebody from the 70s?  I don't know if it was...  Not Juan Epstein.  Fuck.  Arnold Horshack?  No, no, no.  It's not a welcome...  It's not one of the sweaters.  Okay. 
[01:31:30]  Shit.  I just don't know the guy's name.  Come on.  Active from the 70s.  You would know him if you saw him.  Like, oh, yeah.  But I can't...  Oh, boy.  He might have been in Greece.  Give me the Rydell High friends from Greece.  Rydell High?  Yeah.  Give me Travolta's friends from Greece.  Ha, ha, ha, ha.  It might be one of them.  Travolta's friends.  I can't...  God damn it's bugging me. 
[01:32:00]  That's a tough one.  Yeah, I don't know.  Looks like the big ragu a little bit.  Yes, but the guy I'm thinking of is...  Oh, I know who she looks like.  It's maybe a weirdo.  It's a comedian.  Oh, God.  None of you know him.  Howard, I used to know.  There was a comedy team named High Powered Howard and Pat Man.  And Howard was a...  Never heard of that.  No, you didn't.  They broke up.  Pat Man was an obese black guy and Howard was a skinny Jewish guy. 
[01:32:30]  They did all these really weird sketches.  They broke up years ago.  And just looked like Howard.  That's why they couldn't play some...  Oops, sorry.  All right.  Who's your love for an hour?  Oh, my cousin Phil.  Helpful.  It's like...  Why don't we take a break?  All right.  I'm going to eat.  Speaking of this whole America's Got Talent and fucking whatnot judges, I guess, David  Hasselhoff was on MTV, Europe Music Awards, and supposedly he was drunk and the audio's 
[01:33:00]  really good.  Wow.  That guy just can't fucking lay off the sauce.  I love him.  Oh, man.  And he doesn't care if he's got to go out and do shit.  You don't give a shit.  Let's drink.  And then I think we've got to get serious today.  Talk about the Fort Hood incident.  Ah.  There's some shit there today.  What happened?  Savage.  Well, the Al-Qaeda link and all that stuff.  Yeah.  Political correctness might have gotten in the way.  It definitely did.  But everybody's giving the FBI and CIA a beating, which I don't think they should.  No, not at this point.  We'll get into it a little bit after the break and other things. 
[01:33:30]  Opie and Anthony, starring Will Jimmy Norton.  I have to make an announcement because I've been forgetting.  Oh?  My Virginia Beach shows this weekend.  I will not be in Virginia Beach.  Reason being, Leno's schedule changes so much.  I was scheduled for Jay's show on Friday, and we canceled the weekend because I wouldn't  be able to make Thursday or Friday.  And then Leno's schedule changed like two days later.  So I'm going the week after.  And we tried to get the Virginia gig back, but they had already booked another headliner, 
[01:34:00]  which was fine.  So your tickets will be honored.  I'm making the date up in January.  I apologize.  We tried to get it back like three days later, and they had just gotten somebody's last minute.  That seems to be a problem.  Yeah.  No big deal.  I'll do it in January.  Jimmy, you're letting your fans down.  Nah, we're making the date up.  Oh.  Hollywood Jimmy's letting everyone down.  I know.  I'm going to go see these little people.  I'm going to go see these little people and do my little nightclub act.  Hey, uh, the DC sniper goes down today. 
[01:34:30]  Oh, is it today?  Good.  Today's the day.  The U.S. Supreme Court has refused to block Tuesday's execution of the man known as the  DC sniper.  John Allen Muhammad is scheduled to die by injection at a prison in Virginia for the killing of  Dean Harold Myers during a three-week deadly massacre in 2002 that spanned Maryland, Virginia,  and Washington, D.C.  Muhammad and his teenage accomplice, Lee Boyd Malvo, were also suspected in fatal shootings  in other states, including Louisiana and Arizona. 
[01:35:00]  Malvo pleaded guilty and got life in prison.  Muhammad was sentenced to death.  He will never see his children again or get to hug them, just like I will not see my son  again.  Muhammad still has a clemency petition before Virginia Governor Tim Kaine.  The high court did not comment Monday on why it refused to consider his appeal.  Good.  Seven fucking years later, though.  That's not bad for a death penalty case.  I know that's not bad, but it shouldn't even be that.  That's why I'm saying there should be some kind of fucking appeal that'll pop up at the 
[01:35:30]  last minute.  Because it seems too fast, to tell you the truth, in this stupid country with this thing.  He obviously did it.  This isn't a case where maybe he didn't do it.  He fucking did this.  And he should be put to death.  So you don't think it's going to go down?  You think some last second thing happens?  I'm too cynical about things like that.  I'd love to see it.  I hope it does.  But I'd be very surprised.  He's going down today.  Today.  That's pretty nice. 
[01:36:00]  The Supreme Court didn't want to listen.  What do we do with the Fort Hood guy?  Does he get executed eventually?  Well, OB, stop it.  He's innocent until proven guilty, first of all.  Secondly, he is talking in the hospital, but he has refused to cooperate with authorities  and asked for a lawyer.  So before you say anything else, you watch your mouth about him.  Yeah, okay.  Ugh, this country. 
[01:36:30]  God, the only thing, you know, that very brave woman cop.  Yeah.  That was there that shot this fucking animal in the torso while she got two bullets ripped  through her legs.  Just didn't hit the vitals, I guess.  Was she going for the vitals, Ant?  You know a little something about guns.  You go for center mass.  Is that what she was going for?  Yeah.  Center mass.  Sometimes you hit, you know, sometimes you hit the goods, sometimes you don't.  And apparently, this guy pulled through. 
[01:37:00]  He's talking.  But again, the first thing he comes out with is, I want my lawyer.  Then another thing that got me on this case that was very interesting is that fucking  Iman, that mosque Iman that he was, that was preaching at the same mosque that two of  the terrorists from 9-11 went to, and around the same time, this savage was in there also,  listening to this guy's just propaganda and hatred of the country.  Is he still preaching that guy or no?  No.  What happened?  He went to Yemen. 
[01:37:30]  He went to Yemen.  He did some time in Yemen.  Then they let him out of prison for some reason.  But now he's back on the most wanted list.  He has a website, though, where he praised this animal, said that he is an example of what all Muslims in the United States Army  should do, because it is horrible that you would fight another Muslim for America.  Yes.  And he is saying that he is a hero, and everybody in his situation should rise up. 
[01:38:00]  You should only fight another Muslim if you're car bombing a market in Iraq, or if you're fucking,  if you're running into an office of social services, or killing Iraqi police officers,  or Afghani police officers, then you should kill other Muslims.  That's the, it's funny how the Imams don't come out against that.  No.  They're just fucking disgraceful.  No, and he said that the people that did come out, the Muslims that came out against it, were cowards.  Of course, yeah.  Not real Muslims.  Meanwhile, the Imams is not running into anything with a bomb strapped to them. 
[01:38:30]  No.  You know, Bin Laden and fucking Al-Zawahari, they didn't run into anything with bombs strapped to them.  They're fucking smart guys.  They barked out orders, and they sat back and watched it happen.  Yeah.  And they financed it.  Unbelievable.  So, yeah, that's what we're sent with this guy.  He's, you know, killed a fuckload of people, injured a lot.  These poor guys were just in this place.  I don't know why they weren't, you know, armed.  Why wouldn't you just have something on?  You know what it is?  At all times.  Not even all the soldiers in there.  But when you have a concentration of soldiers in a certain place, in this day and age that we're living in, 
[01:39:00]  there should absolutely be some kind of armed guard in the room.  Where if something like this happens, there's a response team.  I'm not talking everywhere there's two soldiers walking.  But when you have a center like this where apparently there were a lot of fucking soldiers in here, why not protect these motherfuckers?  One guy with a fucking rifle would have at least, they would have had a chance. 
[01:39:30]  But, you know, nothing.  And how about this asshole, General Casey, complaining about if we lose our diversity, it's worse than force.  Shut the fuck up.  He won't call it up.  Won't call it terror.  Maybe it's too soon to jump to conclusions.  And Red Eye covered this last night.  Gutfeld's fucking Greg Law was brilliant.  It's amazing how the backlash obsession we have in this fucking stupid country, we immediately worry about not our other Muslims in the military behaving this way or thinking this way. 
[01:40:00]  We immediately worry about the backlash against Islam.  And offending.  And, yeah.  And meanwhile, after 9-11, what was there, a little police profiling?  Muslims weren't attacked in the streets.  There was no fucking backlash.  I'm so sick of the Americans.  Why do we automatically fucking self-flagellate when something like this happens?  We love it.  And what do you guys know on the Al-Qaeda angle?  Like, he was in contact with them?  Apparently there was an angle where there was an email address that hadn't been used in quite some time that had started getting some activity again. 
[01:40:30]  And they were aware, right?  They started monitoring this email address and it was Al-Qaeda.  Why wouldn't that throw up a red flag?  It did.  They knew this guy was in touch.  Could be a problem.  More, though.  They knew he was in touch with Al-Qaeda.  But here's what it is.  You don't expect, unless, especially if you're listening to communication between him and Al-Qaeda, that he's just going to go off the deep end and shoot up a bunch of people. 
[01:41:00]  Right.  You want to know who the fuck else is involved.  Is there anyone else in the military involved?  Is this something that's a single case or is it running rampant in the military?  Who is he talking to?  Who's the guy that he's talking to?  Who is it financed by?  Does it go all the way back to Bin Laden?  Like, they weren't going to just jump on the guy at the first sign and blow the case.  In hindsight, you go like, shit, yes, they should have grabbed him.  But you're not going to know that they're going to jump. 
[01:41:30]  This guy's going to grab a fucking gun and start shooting up soldiers.  And you've also had a bunch of stuff stopped.  Like, when you look at England, at the liquids, if they stop it, they're going to make bombs on the plane by bringing liquids on.  Yeah.  All of that, imagine if they just grabbed the fucking first guy and then the whole rest of that network just went away.  Yeah.  So they've been pretty good with waiting just the right amount of time and snatching everybody up.  They should have, if there's any fault, it should have been they should have kept a closer eye on this guy.  Like, a tail or something where they could have seen that he was purchasing a gun. 
[01:42:00]  Yes.  And that, you know, what was he doing with this?  How does the FBI and Homeland Security, how are they investigating?  And then you do a background check for a pistol and it doesn't pop up.  No red flags pop up.  Because, again, the FBI or CIA, whatever those investigations were, were so not public. 
[01:42:30]  You don't want any red flag, a member of the military who you know is doing something to let them know you're investigating.  They probably figured we'd keep a close eye.  But, again, you can't.  That was basically a suicide mission.  You can't plan on a guy just picking up a gun and, like you said, shooting everybody.  That's a tough one to fight.  Yep.  But the fact, too, that he's just listening to all of this anti-American, Islamic, fucking extremist bullshit.  He's going to that fucking mosque with that extremist imam. 
[01:43:00]  And, again, where's the outrage from Islam and Muslim celebrities, Muslim fucking?  There isn't enough of it.  There isn't enough of it.  There's, again, people are so scared to say anything for fear of, oh, forget about the people that were killed and wounded.  Let's not offend.  You know, there are other Muslims that are fine in the army.  Let's not shake them up by saying that there's a problem.  There is a problem. 
[01:43:30]  Islam is inherently this violence in it.  There's this violence.  Regardless of if it's just, let's get a fatwa against this guy because he fucking wrote a book with a picture in it.  There's inherent violence in how they treat their women, how they treat people, how they deal with certain crimes with each other.  That is inherently violent in the religion, which they continuously say is a loving, godlike, and wonderful religion. 
[01:44:00]  But, meanwhile, all the teachings of the Koran are, you know, answer this with killing or beheadings or violence or some shit.  So, it's not.  Stop lying.  I got lying, Allah.  I got lying.  And the thing, and you're absolutely right.  And this is how phony we are.  And it's the same Susan Boyle syndrome.  People don't want to admit.  She's Islam, yeah.  The bomb blew up on her face.  That's funny. 
[01:44:30]  It was one of those bunker busters.  He ate it.  People don't want to admit that they are just scared of violent reaction.  Because look at something like abortion clinic bombings and religious right extremists who are fucking pieces of shit and terrorists in their own right.  When one of those guys is caught, people demand justifiably their execution or their pieces of garbage.  They're going to prison.  You don't hear the fucking generals or the president going, let's not overreact. 
[01:45:00]  Let's not blame all Christians.  Because people inherently know that it's the act of a nut.  And it's really not all Christians.  So, that's not needed to be said.  But because people feel like, look, most Muslims do think this way.  They have to go, don't jump to kill.  Why do they do that?  They don't do that for anybody else.  Unless it's fucking a group that they secretly feel is violent or is a threat.  Then they have to overcompensate by yelling, don't jump to conclusions.  Fucking bullshit.  Yeah, yeah.  That's amazing that that's happening in the military. 
[01:45:30]  That type of thing.  Look at the pressure from Washington.  I know.  It's just amazing.  Especially now in the last year.  The president coming out saying, let's not jump to conclusions until we investigate.  And then he goes, after a full investigation, we're going to do it and make sure this never happens again.  How?  Yeah.  How?  He jumps at you.  Why?  By fucking coddling Muslim soldiers?  By, by, oh no, you can't do that.  You can't even say, let's profile some of them.  Let's put some of these Muslim soldiers into, and have them speak to a psychiatrist. 
[01:46:00]  So maybe we could weed out.  They'd be outraged.  You can't do that.  So how, Mr. President, are we going to make sure this never happens again?  You're not.  And why didn't you, well, how come you didn't say let's not jump to conclusions when it was a white cop hassle?  The peering allegedly hassling a fucking man.  He was acting stupid.  Yeah, he was stupid.  He jumped right to conclusions on a fucking pogo stick.  Hours later.  Hours later, the fucking president's saying that guy was acting stupid. 
[01:46:30]  How about this guy?  He was acting like a radical Muslim that killed people for no other reason than they were soldiers, American soldiers.  And you've got to think there's more guys like him embedded in the military.  Of course there are.  Of course there are.  You're right.  He was talking about...  So how are we going to handle that?  How the fuck are they going to handle that?  He yelled Allah Akbar before he shot.  He was on websites condoning suicide bombings. 
[01:47:00]  This guy, obviously, there was this hatred and this, what do I do?  They're going to shit me off to maybe kill Muslims?  Look how he's dressed going into the fucking store beforehand.  He's in complete Islamic garb, which, you know, in itself, not a bad thing.  Add up the whole puzzle, that costume, costume to me says, I hate the American way of life.  I'm sorry.  That's how I see it. 
[01:47:30]  I don't like seeing people in those outfits in this country.  The problem I have with this guy and the handling of this guy is not that the military didn't stop it,  because, again, they're investigating with the CIA.  And because he, like, when he's, you hear that a Muslim guy shot everybody up, he was a psychiatrist.  My first thought, ah, just a nut.  Because, you know, a psychiatrist, they're always fucking a little crazy anyway.  Yeah, yeah.  And a nut went crazy.  It does happen in the military.  He had hearing about so much heartache and fucking killing and everything that he just lost his mind.  He snapped. 
[01:48:00]  But that wasn't it.  But when you hear about people who are too afraid because they saw warning signs and they did not want to appear, that's the problem.  If we've gotten to a point in this country where we've been taught, do not go with your gut and at least tell somebody how you feel,  because God forbid you have an inappropriate or incorrect thought about somebody based on gender, on race, or on religion,  and yet it's perfectly acceptable to have positive thoughts about people based on gender, race, or religion. 
[01:48:30]  Right.  We're a phony, stupid country.  You know, could we have some type of recognition that whether they're homegrown here in America or from other countries,  there is a fucking problem with Muslims, Muslim extremists, and violence against Americans.  It just, it's not an Irish guy.  It's not, you know, and then you look back, everybody's got to bring up the fucking, you know, the Oklahoma City bombing. 
[01:49:00]  Yeah, McVeigh.  Yeah, McVeigh.  All right.  We understand.  It does happen.  When was that, by the way?  You know, 90 fucking, when?  95.  Tragedy happened.  But for the most part, can we look at the law of averages here?  That we are looking at, for the most part, young to middle-aged Muslim men are wreaking havoc.  And profiling is not a bad thing, especially in the military, where usually democracy takes a backseat to the chain of command and discipline and everything else. 
[01:49:30]  They could probably get away with more things than you can here on the outside.  Well, when CIA guys are being fucking prosecuted for doing their jobs or they might go to jail, why would any military guy take that chance?  You're absolutely right.  Why take the chance of throwing your career down the shitter by confronting this guy and how you feel about him, maybe going to a superior on how you feel about a Muslim when, yeah, guys that were doing their job at Guantanamo now might be prosecuted for interrogating terrorists. 
[01:50:00]  I mean, it's funny because this guy was an officer, too.  I mean, he's a major, I think.  You know, it's like you're less likely to fuck with a major than a grunt because, you know, he can make a lot more problems.  There's no need to go there.  Let's go to Sean in Louisiana.  Sean, what do you got, buddy?  Hey, how you doing?  First, I'd like to say it's a horrible tragedy.  I knew the pregnant soldier who got killed there.  She's a good lady.  I knew her in Korea.  I wanted to share the safety tips that our anti-terrorism center here on Fort Polk emailed out to us right after the incident. 
[01:50:30]  They said, A, to get out of the line of fire, and B, to report suspicious activities, such as this guy hopping up on a desk and shooting people.  Yeah, so that's it, huh?  Meanwhile, get out of the line of fire.  People did, and this guy methodically, again, walked around to wounded soldiers, chased them down, shot them to make sure they were dead.  What are you supposed to do at that point?  How about an arm detail when there are more than X amount of soldiers in a certain place? 
[01:51:00]  And report suspicious activity unless your suspicion is raised because of somebody's religion or ethnicity or bubble or any other fucking sacred cow of the left.  Well, I think the issue with an arm detail is when you're on a military post, I mean, unfortunately, there are going to be concentrations of large amounts of soldiers.  You have that at the commissary.  You have that at the PX.  They have military policemen who are at these places, but unfortunately, there are not enough military policemen. 
[01:51:30]  I mean, they just cannot expect them.  When we're in the United States, when we're in a supposed place of safety, you can't expect there to be armed guards if we're in a military base.  They're at the gates.  I mean, you could not have protected against this man because he was a simple, you know, he was a lone, crazy nut job.  Yeah, this was a tough one.  I'm not saying it would have definitely done it or it's possible, but it just seems to me that in this day and age, instead of just having MPs, there should be some kind of detail, maybe even a new military occupation that is protecting soldiers on base in places of large concentration. 
[01:52:00]  Anthony, they do have what's called the quick reaction force, which is actually they ended up storming in after the policemen took down Hassan.  It's a small policewoman who's on call who are, you know, uniformed soldiers with all their gear and everything.  We're there in case of a massive incident, and I think they have to report, you know, within maybe five minutes or so, but I mean, there's just, I don't know. 
[01:52:30]  A lot happens in five minutes.  That'll happen in four minutes.  Yeah, it is tough to protect against one guy who's allowed to have a gun snapping in a four minute.  It's almost like you can't have enough security details where you're going to protect from a lone nut doing that.  You just can't.  I mean, there was five guys and it was a coordinated effort.  You know, and look, there's a way to profile or at least use common sense with dignity. 
[01:53:00]  Because, I mean, it's not even to be politically correct, but the majority of, I mean, almost, if not 99.99% of Muslim soldiers are fucking, I mean, there was one, I believe, in Iraq or whatever that killed some of his, he was overseas.  He killed a couple of his own men, too, I believe, in a tent.  It was a grenade.  Yeah, yeah, right, right, right.  But, you know, the majority, I really do, just want to fucking live like Americans and fight the fight and whatever.  They're not fucking problems.  So you don't want those guys to be humiliated or made uncomfortable.  There's got to be a way to do it with dignity and respect.  How are they going to make sure this was just one lone nut? 
[01:53:30]  How are they going to make sure that?  That's the question today.  We're following up.  How are they going to do that with all the new rules?  Follow up on whatever intelligence they've gotten together before this guy did this.  Let's go to Alex in Binghamton.  Alex, hopefully they got enough.  Hey, man.  What up, Alex?  So, yeah, I'm a political science major up here at Binghamton University and taking an Islam and world politics place.  And, Anthony, before you're talking about the Koran and how it says that they can cut each other's heads off and whatnot like that. 
[01:54:00]  But, you know, in reality, it says that you can treat a woman according to Islamic law or, you know, treat each other according to Islamic law.  And there are just those radical nations like Iran that make you crazy enough where they're, you know, you cut off the hands of a thief or something like that.  It's not everyone.  Now, look at our close ally, Saudi Arabia, my friend.  That right there is another.  Talk about human rights fucking violations.  We sit there and the government says, wow, we've got to take care of human rights here and here and here. 
[01:54:30]  But Saudi Arabia has gotten away with being one of the worst violators of human rights ever.  And they still practice horrific, barbaric.  If the U.N. Declaration on Human Rights, the Islamic Nations came out with the Universal Islamic Declaration on Human Rights.  Oh, so it's different.  They don't compensate for that.  And they use it as a justification for, you know, for, I guess, attacks and human rights violations.  But they say we're following the code of Islam. 
[01:55:00]  You cannot.  What I'm saying is you can't have that many countries that are Islamic countries that are setting like an example for for Islam.  They are like the benchmark.  You look at Saudi Arabia.  It's like, OK, here's a productive country.  They make a lot of fucking money.  They have classes.  You know, they have it's obviously not Western, but they do have cities that you would walk down the streets and go, wow.  Hey, you know, these are buildings and these are people and they're going about their business. 
[01:55:30]  Yet the example they're setting is that's all fine and well, but you break our religious laws and you will fucking pay like you couldn't imagine in America.  And one of the real sins of it is, is that there are very young people in those nations that have tried to, you know, protest and make a difference and they're just killed.  Oh, they shut down.  Look what happened in Iran when they got a little uppity.  Oh, yeah.  That fucking thing.  Yeah, that they shut them down pretty quickly. 
[01:56:00]  You know, you said you fall for the I hate America feel from when you see that Arabic go.  But if you I don't know if you guys remember a couple months back up in Binghamton, there was an immigrant who shot up the civic center up there.  The wild story.  And he blamed it on the fact that he couldn't speak English.  Well, and, you know, just, you know, there's a million other immigrants in the United States of America that can't speak English well, that aren't shooting places up.  Just like there are a ton of Islamic people in the United States that aren't going around killing people either.  Just as Jimmy was saying before.  Yeah, there's a difference, though. 
[01:56:30]  There's a difference.  See, I'm not saying every Islamic person is a terrorist or is doing these.  But every terrorist has been an Islamic person.  There's a difference.  There's a big difference between that.  You're taking a small portion of a larger group, but it is all them.  It is like just this piece of Islamic, of people that are Islamic.  Oh, man, well, I want you to come to my class, Anthony.  And, sir, one thing, too, that drives me nuts is the reason that you associate Islam, or we associate Islam with that violence, is because the guys who are committing it are telling us that's why they're doing it. 
[01:57:00]  Like, he was yelling, Allahu Akbar, and Bin Laden, and they all say they do it because they're Muslim and the honor of Islam.  They marry the violence to the religion.  And there doesn't seem to be...  And there's a justification to ruin the religion as a whole.  And there doesn't seem to be, ever, this outrage by Islamic leadership, whoever that might be. 
[01:57:30]  There's always...  They will always come forward and say, please, let's not jump to conclusion, because we're not all like this.  But you never get this huge condemnation of these acts by a large portion of Muslims, and it's infuriating.  No, you're 100% right about that.  Thank you very much, guys.  All right, Alex, thank you, man.  We got John calling back from last week. 
[01:58:00]  You certainly would remember John.  He lost his son in Iraq, and it was an unbelievable phone call last week.  Hey, John, how are you, man?  Good.  How are you boys doing?  Pretty good.  Hey, Bob, what's going on right now?  This is just...  I'm speechless for a while there.  First of all, my heart goes out to the families of those that are lost.  And it really hits home.  You know what I'm saying?  You wonder, because your son, you lost in the war. 
[01:58:30]  And is there any different...  I mean, they say to lose a child.  Obviously, it doesn't matter here or there.  But is there any different feeling or level of outrage for someone whose son was just shot down like this?  Like, is there more of a frustration, or do you think it's all the same?  It's disbelief more than anything.  You expect to be safe on a base.  Oh, yeah.  That's why the majority of the people there don't have weapons other than the military police that patrol. 
[01:59:00]  That's your home.  That's the place where you're supposed to be the safest.  Not to mention, you're talking about a major who gunned down these people in cold blood.  But I just, you know, I hit the rank of gunnery sergeant when all the, you know, when I ended my career.  And I just can't see, even as a gunnery sergeant, you know, you look up to majors.  I mean, you got your own little things that you say, you know, behind the back, of course. 
[01:59:30]  Don't call me, sir.  I work for a living.  But I just, I can't, Adam, this happening.  And now, as far as I'm concerned, there's a time and a place for ethnic profiling.  And now is the time and the place.  Of course, yes, yes.  If it's just using common sense and checking.  They need to go in.  They need to do a deep internal investigation with CID, which CID, I don't know if you're aware of,  Central Intelligence Division, if they still even exist. 
[02:00:00]  They need to get CID in there or whatever and do a deep internal investigation  and look at the background of all the soldiers that have any type of Islamic ties.  Well, I think they should absolutely start out with looking at who this guy was talking to,  if there were any other people going to this mosque that he went to that are in the military,  if he was having any correspondence with anybody else in the military, see if this is some kind of, 
[02:00:30]  obviously it was an independent spree at this base by him.  But is this a bigger plan, maybe, that people that are radical Muslims in the army are being groomed to take out soldiers on their home bases?  Is that a problem?  Look into it, you know?  You know, Anthony, one of the things that I've heard before in the past is that what they're trying to do now 
[02:01:00]  is they're putting these sleeper cells into the United States with zero criminal record.  These people have not done a single thing wrong in their life.  They blend right in.  These guys are sleeper cells.  They could sit here.  They come to the country.  They could be here for 10 years.  They build themselves alive.  That's what we were talking about.  This is exactly what Ann and I were talking about yesterday.  This is what scares the shit out of me.  They're already embedded all over the fucking place.  They're the ones you'll never figure.  They'll raise a family.  Their kids will go to our schools, and they'll run a business. 
[02:01:30]  You'll go into a store.  You'll talk to them.  They'll smile at you.  Suddenly, one day, they get a phone call with a keyword, and they're activated.  I completely believe that.  I think they're already embedded.  They have time on their side.  They can wait it out.  They can wait 10 years, 15 years if they have to.  That's Manchurian candidate shit.  There really is no way.  There's no way to combat that, really, unless you get a list of who the people.  There's no way to combat that.  Especially because they know how we are as a society right now. 
[02:02:00]  Dummies.  Society.  But they know how we are in this country right now, making it a lot easier.  They know they're not going to be questioned for anything.  Especially for people like John Stodd.  People that have no criminal record.  They have no paper trail to any terrorists.  Things like that.  You can't walk up to them and just start, you know, round them up, lock them up, internment camps.  Let's go.  You can't do that.  So that is a huge threat right now. 
[02:02:30]  Yeah, you've got the new recruits, and you tell them, look, you're going to bide your time.  It's going to take about 10 years.  Sit back, have fun, have a good life in America, and we'll let you know when it's that time.  We'll let you know.  Guys, I'm going to let you go.  All right, man.  Thanks, Jan.  Take care, John.  Anytime, John.  John from Connecticut.  Bye.  All right.  So, all right.  Yeah, that's fucked up.  Jimmy's tuna fish arrived, so why don't we take a little break?  Tuna fish.  It won't stop the flow of yourself.  I could do a couple things at once.  Meow, meow, meow. 
[02:03:00]  Pow.  Jimmy, look.  Hey, that was pretty good.  That bastard looks so much like Roland.  Oh, I know.  Doesn't he?  Roland Campos in.  It'll cast him.  I don't like American people.  I was in Sweden.  I need to buy a gun.  Maybe a gun.  Bruce.  Bruce.  I don't like.  Is this going to do the whole river?  I have to go to.  The whole album from beginning to end, Bruce.  I got to go to the mosque.  The mosque, I go. 
[02:03:30]  What?  After the Bruce show, I go to the mosque.  I'll lock bar.  Hello.  Hello.  Hello.  Here I was Roland.  Get your fucking ass in here, Roland.  We missed you.  All right.  I want to just take all of Roland's clothes off and just roll them in warm oil and kiss  him.  He would love that.  Sweaty mess, Roland.  No, he's a fucking animal.  I think he would enjoy that.  Minus eight and he's got a fucking tank top on.  Still sweating.  And a skull cap.  Fucking lunatic.  Hey, you guys want to go over the top New York songs of all time? 
[02:04:00]  What?  Top songs based on New York.  Empire State of Mind.  In there?  Of course it is.  How is it of all time?  I won't do the list.  It just fucking came out.  And get Kenny's Empire State of Mind for everybody to enjoy.  Oh, yeah.  That's a good one.  Still lots of radio to do.  Stay there.  It's kind of a quickie, but we were talking about jerking off during the break.  Because Steve came in with a product called Cum Sox. 
[02:04:30]  Yes.  They're fuzzy.  Could you please return them to me when you're done?  They're also known as throats.  Cum Sox.  Your fuzzy friend.  Use them and then return them.  I'd like to make tea.  And I don't think they're going to be happy because, you know, they got the product in front of us, hoping we would talk about it.  Let me open this bit up.  Who the fuck would buy a Cum Sox? 
[02:05:00]  The question, Greg, is who wouldn't?  You have that one wrong.  A sock was always a last resort.  You can wear this like a fucking, like a thing to be cool.  Look, we're an ABA basketball team.  I'm going to go jogging with those.  Someone use mine.  Ew, mine's sticky.  The Cum Sox by Robco.  Now, you put your dick in here.  Now, I noticed the top is open.  No, you don't put your dick in here.  Oh, is that what they're talking about? 
[02:05:30]  Well, then how do you jerk off with it?  No, you don't.  Oh, you rookies.  Here's what happens.  You fucking, you shoot your cum all over.  You immediately click off the gay porn.  And then you fucking put your hand through the cum sock.  And you roll it and wipe it off with your cum sock.  Yes, you do.  I think at the end.  Imagine feeling so tense.  Unlike anything felt before.  Place over erection.  No, this, you put on your, you put it over your dick, right?  Well, this is only one way to find out.  Attaboy.  Get over here, Greg.  And then you squeeze a little bit and you jerk.  Okay, you're right.  But someone tells me. 
[02:06:00]  And then the cum stays in the middle of this cum sock.  This is not meant for a slide jerk.  This isn't a slide jerk.  This is a grip jerk.  Right.  Where you grip and tug.  There's two different kinds of jerks, ladies.  For anybody interested.  Guys, they know this.  There's a slide jerk.  Where you use lube.  And actually slide your hand up and down.  Then there's the grip jerk.  Where your hand goes around the skin of the penis.  And never moves on the skin.  But penis skin is kind of a funny thing.  It really moves up and down. 
[02:06:30]  With your hand.  So you could just jerk.  And your hand never moves across the skin.  That's right.  And that's two different types of jerk.  Now, the slide jerk feels much better.  But will take longer.  You will take longer to slide jerk than you will to grip jerk.  And also, when you're jerking off like with this, that.  It's just like the cock is shrugging.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  Got me.  I don't know.  Got me.  Who knows?  Not me.  I don't know.  Don't tell me. 
[02:07:00]  Well, this brought up a discussion.  Because Danny goes, what did you say about...  Because we were all talking about when we were drinking off as kids.  Yeah.  You would try to prepare.  Like you might go and get some tissues or something.  But sometimes, at last resort, you would grab a sock or something because you didn't want  your parents to find out.  I think that's how the whole cum sock thing comes to be.  Because as you're a kid, it's poor preparation.  You just start going at it.  And you say, oh, no.  I need to grab something.  There's planned jerk and unplanned jerk, too.  So planned jerk, you can get your accoutrement and shit to clean up with. 
[02:07:30]  Unplanned jerk, you just start fiddling with yourself.  And you're like, holy shit, I'm jerking off.  And then you've got to look around and go, I'm not getting up.  I'm grabbing a sock.  Well, yeah.  Then as a kid, you just let your cum fly anywhere.  And the point I made during the break, I said, you know, when you get older and you kind  of get nice stuff, you realize that cum is a real drag.  Yeah, it ruins things.  It ruins all your nice stuff.  You have to get out of a couch.  So you make sure you're well prepared.  You never wanted to unleash or clean up with a white t-shirt. 
[02:08:00]  Because even through the wash, it'll just have this fucking Morshack test of shame on  it.  It'll wreak havoc on your good stuff.  Yes.  So you can't just spray that like you're a teenager.  We're agreeing this is not a slide jerk.  It's like a leg warmer.  Friction, even on something that's soft, it's soft.  It's like a sheep's wool or something.  But something without lube, this will chafe you.  Yes, it will.  I think.  So you grab and tug, maybe the head like slides a little bit as your cock is shrugging. 
[02:08:30]  And then, all right, now you unload.  And the top is open, so you got to make sure.  Yeah, it's kind of in there.  All right.  It'll be in the middle there.  All right.  It'll be inside.  And then you turn it inside out and put it in the wash.  I don't know.  I don't know.  You come in your wash.  I don't know what you do with this.  Stupidest product ever.  Need me to tote that for ye.  You kind of need to put like a rubber band or something on the end of it to prevent spillage. 
[02:09:00]  There could be spillage.  You squeeze off the top.  Come on.  And now, if you notice, there's like a fold inside that keeps anything from dripping down  the sides back onto your nuts.  If you want to sit there and bask in the pleasure for a while.  I want to fall asleep with my cum sock on where it's like peeling gauze off an open wound.  Like a burn victim.  Yeah.  They got to peel it off with water and shit.  It's like pulling a wool sweater off a burn victim. 
[02:09:30]  Why did you think you could wear that two days after the fire, Bill?  Or it's going to go back to the way things used to be.  You can take it, wring it out, potato flakes come out, you're making a potato.  You got potato flakes all over the place.  Tuckmore from Buffalo writes, don't forget the caveman jerk where you rub your dick between  your hands like you're starting a fire with two sticks.  No, that's silly.  There's two basic types, basic categories.  The slide jerk, the grip jerk.  The slide jerk is good if you've got time and really want to extend the goodness involving 
[02:10:00]  from sack to head.  Now, grip jerk is, I don't have much time, but I got to cum.  I got to cum, Gelman.  So you just grab and tug until you're done.  A little shame, then you go about your business.  A lot of shame.  That's all we got on the cum sock.  A lot of shame.  A lot of shame.  Especially when you click off what you had been watching.  Good God, what's wrong with me?  Oh, you know how many times I've had to do everything from fucking clean off the remote 
[02:10:30]  because you had to shut it off to cleaning off the screen of my iPhone?  Boy, there's nothing worse than having cumzies on your finger when you slide that turn on.  It's just, it leaves a fucking streak.  By the way, no one used my phone.  Like you had to say that.  All right, we got David Hasselhoff.  We got the James Gandolfini going after the paparazzi.  We got Gandolfini.  I love the fact that he fucking hates the paparazzi.  Well, here's the back story. 
[02:11:00]  I saw the video clip and he looks like Tony Soprano.  Of course he does.  You realize he really wasn't acting when he was Tony Soprano.  Gandolfini was shopping with his stepmom on Jane Street in New York City  and after being followed for about an hour, finally went off on the photographer.  What happened?  I don't know, I'm sorry.  I'm just tearing up.  Beautiful young lady.  Abdul-Jabbar has a fucking rare form of leukemia.  Fuck, man.  That's very depressing news.  How old is he?  Kareem, he's probably 60.  I don't know.  He looks great, though.  Yeah, he's on there talking about how he's dying.  That really depresses me. 
[02:11:30]  Fuck.  Nah, he ain't dying.  Oh, well.  Fight of his life, though.  Fucking Abdul-Jabbar, man.  He looks like he can still fucking play.  Look at that motherfucker.  Black Belt and the Martial Arts.  Yeah, Bruce Lee movies.  Or at least one, right?  God damn.  You better get it right.  I'm going to yell at you.  Highest score in NBA history.  Really?  Oh, Kareem?  Yes.  Oh, yeah.  Most points ever.  All-time scoring leader.  And he was the co-pilot on Airplane.  Well, that's what he says.  That's in your mind.  Here's Gandolfini.  Relax.  Come on. 
[02:12:00]  Come on.  Come on.  Come on.  Come on.  Come on.  Come on.  Come on.  You understand me?  Yeah.  Relax.  I'm not going to break your fucking face.  Get away from my car.  All right, dude.  That's kind of scary.  That's Tony Soprano.  It's the Tony Soprano voice.  Get the fuck away from me.  He's got that fucking same tone to his voice.  And then I think he punched the camera out of the guy's hands.  Then did he spit on it and throw money on them?  Goddamn paparazzi don't respect nothing.  You can't blame me.  It's like the paparazzi. 
[02:12:30]  I like the fact that they have tougher laws.  Because these fucking...  It's like you can't get a moment's privacy.  They don't just take a picture and leave.  It's like the guy is still a fucking...  I'm a celebrity whore, but I would never follow a guy for a fucking hour.  It's creepy.  Every second they are out on the street or in public, they have cameras in their fucking faces.  And they're being asked embarrassing questions just to try to get a rise out of them.  Who is that?  But we as people love seeing it.  I'll say that much. 
[02:13:00]  Who is that?  Joanna Krupa?  Who is she?  Wow.  I don't know.  She's aight.  She's aight.  Dude, in the cabs?  She used to be a juggie.  Who?  A what?  She used to be a juggie on the man show.  Oh, okay.  Wait, there's a girl that they're showing in the cabs with that little TV thing they do?  Yeah.  She's promoting Sports Illustrated, the Sports Illustrated app, I think.  Good.  Good.  Hot.  Nice.  If you could find...  Jugg material.  It's a blonde, thin, big, natural boobies that just fall just enough to make you realize 
[02:13:30]  they're real.  Jugg.  Jugg.  Jugg.  Jugg.  Jugg.  If you could find this girl, she might even be one of the swimsuit models.  I don't know.  Mm-hmm.  Good luck on that.  Oh.  Yeah, this could be it right here.  Oh.  Ooh.  Wow.  Those are ample.  World's sexiest app.  Ah, whatever.  God damn.  I'll have to do more research.  I'll bring it to the show.  Hey.  Are you done with Gandolfini?  Yeah, that was it.  It was just quirky. 
[02:14:00]  I just got to put this out there.  Modern Warfare 2.  Mm-hmm.  Call of Duty.  Modern Warfare 2.  Released today.  I got a little early start last night.  You started playing it already, huh?  Playing the game, yeah.  Playing the online game multiplayer.  I know a lot of people.  This is...  Supposedly, they're saying this is going to be the highest score.  Disgrossing fucking game put out.  That's what I'm hearing.  Well, it's definitely...  It's definitely going to be the biggest media release of the year. 
[02:14:30]  I don't know if it'll beat GTA 4, though.  It's a beat...  Yeah, GTA 4 was big.  It was pretty big.  But this one...  I mean, people...  They do like fucking killing people like that.  I saw on Facebook just a bunch of different people posting pictures at midnight of the  lines for these midnight releases.  Yep.  And these are people like in Idaho or, you know, Ohio.  And the lines are huge.  I know.  This game's been eagerly awaited, especially by, well, me.  I got a copy yesterday and threw that in last night. 
[02:15:00]  Fucking amazing.  Just great.  I was playing multiplayer.  And of course, I am a PC guy, so I'm more mouse keyboard.  But that's kind of going the way of the dinosaur.  But I'm trying to get the hang of it with the console thing.  I am noob dead meat all the time.  So look for me on there.  My name...  I play on Xbox and my name is...  Jizzbucket.  Yes.  Jizzbucket. 
[02:15:30]  Jizzbucket.  That's, uh...  No.  Noodles 61.  That's me.  Pop on a little later, and you can shoot me, stab me in the back, do whatever, because  I'm terrible.  I come around a corner with a fucking machine gun, blast him, and one guy just goes, pew,  shoots me one shot in the head, I'm done.  That was it.  And he's probably 10.  Little fuck.  How was the graphics?  Amazing.  Really good.  They got EOTech sights now, the Red Dots, a lot of good equipment, and Travis was saying 
[02:16:00]  it's not like you can just start lobbing.  One thing that annoyed me with the last game was the grenades.  Too many fucking grenades where you're standing somewhere, if you're shooting at someone, all  you hear is, clink, clink, clink, and grenades, you're just surrounded.  You can't move anywhere, and you blow up.  So, a little less grenades.  I wonder if there's still the knife.  Yeah, there is.  Is there?  Yeah, I was knifed last night.  But there's other attributes you can get.  Look at this shit.  Yeah, but is that in-game?  Yeah.  That's in-game? 
[02:16:30]  It's amazing.  Oh, wow.  It's fucking great.  So, I'll be playing that later on, if you want to pop online and give us a little Modern  Warfare 2, Noodles 61.  We got it.  Travis, you going to be on?  Of course I'm going to be on.  What's your stupid name?  Andy Sipowitz.  Oh, you're Andy Sipowitz.  Right.  And what about Big Duties?  Of course he is.  Is Big Duties going to be on?  D-Boy is Big Duties on Xbox.  He stole your name.  Well, there's controversy as to who is the villain.  I have real big duties.  As far as contributions to the show, I'd say both of you. 
[02:17:00]  But no, I'm Hello Exactly on Xbox Live.  Oh, Hello Exactly.  I think I'm full.  I've got to clean up my friends list.  Yeah.  I've got to do the same.  Well, pick it up and let's fucking fight, motherfuckers.  Tonight.  Tonight.  We're battling.  Can I get involved with my PS3?  No.  Damn it.  Let's go to Matt in Cleveland.  Matt.  Hi, man.  Try it.  Hey, I just, I want to let you fellas know, I took the entire fucking day off to play this  game and I swear to God, I'll probably get fired because I'm going to take tomorrow off 
[02:17:30]  too.  Yeah, it's sick.  I started, when I was playing last night, I started, I guess about nine o'clock and I  looked at the clock 10 minutes into playing and it was 11.30.  Jesus.  It's one of those games where you're like, I know it's got to be, oh fuck, I got to, I  was like, I got to get to bed because if I don't go now and go, well, one more, one  more map, one more map, I was going to be there all night.  But when I get home today, oh, I'm on.  So, uh.  Fucking phenomenal game.  Noodles 61.  Did you hook it up to the theater? 
[02:18:00]  I can, but I was playing upstairs.  I can play it on the fucking 11 foot wide screen.  Holy shit.  And that's another thing.  Holy shit.  You got to videotape that.  I got to see how that looks.  The options are great because they have this, uh, uh, a screen width option where you sit  there and you adjust.  If you got a widescreen TV, the sides of the picture go out and up and down.  So now you're playing on the entire width and, and height of your screen instead of it  being letterboxed or anything like that.  Uh, it's just, and again, the graphics are great. 
[02:18:30]  They got a tactical, like a tactical nuke at one point.  Once you reach a certain level and do certain things, you can just nuke your fucking map.  And, uh, they got Predator drones, which are pains in the ass.  Dude, the Predator drones, you're so dead when those things start coming in.  And you get that.  There is no escaping that.  You get that cool overhead green fucking view like, uh, you see, you know, when they're  showing films from, uh, Iraq.  Sure.  And you just zero in on concentrations of people and blow the fucking shit out of the 
[02:19:00]  gun.  One of my favorite missions from the first Modern Warfare where you're in a helicopter  and you could, you could cycle between night vision and, uh, and infrared.  It was awesome.  You just see these little-  It looked like you were fucking killing people.  Like these little white glowing running things through a field and you just take a huge,  like, 50 cal thing to them and it's just-  And you see the heat signature is just smeared.  It's fucking great.  Sounds awesome.  Danny, the best part of that map is when you start shooting at the church and they yell  at you.  It's beautiful.  I guess.  All right, Matt.  Thank you, sir.  See you tonight, motherfucker. 
[02:19:30]  Yeah, right on.  Let's say hi to Donnie's a cop in Jersey.  Don, what do you got, man?  What do you got?  Just give you perspective.  From perspective, uh, Halo's launch, um, so many other games, this by far was the most  people we've ever had at our mall down in Hamilton.  It had to be a thousand people at one GameStop.  We had about 600 at another and 500 at the third.  Dude, I ridiculously thought when I brought this home yesterday and it was, it's like  a day before the release because it's released today, I thought I was going to go online  for a multiplayer and be like, oh, well, there's no one here because the game's not released 
[02:20:00]  until tomorrow.  Packed full.  People already maxed out their levels.  It's, it's ridiculous.  I don't know how long some of these people have been playing, but, uh, yeah, a lot of fun.  Great game.  Yeah, it's awesome, bro.  Did you get the C-130 board yet?  Where you're flying around in that?  No.  Shit.  That's one of the kill streak options now.  You can board the C-130 and shoot down at your opponents from up in the air.  That's fantastic.  Seven kills, get it.  Seven kills in a row, huh? 
[02:20:30]  Yeah, man, seven kills.  And you can also mop out your, uh, perks now.  You can, uh, choose which ones you want so you don't get stuck with the lame ones.  You can, there's a whole bunch of different ones.  You can customize your own perk package.  Oh, cool.  Yeah, because some of them I was like, I don't want that.  I don't need that.  So, nice.  And also, they got a real kick-ass feature.  If you get killed three or four times in a row by one of these 10-year-old nerds from Japan or something real quick, you can, it will give you, you can assimilate whatever package that individual had.  So, let's say he's got a level 65 gun or whatever, boom, you automatically can assume that persona on your next buy-in. 
[02:21:00]  That's hysterical.  Kick-ass, brother.  A little more equalizing, I guess.  Yeah.  That's cool.  Let's go to Scott in Virginia.  Scott.  Good evening.  Good evening.  And the, uh, you get 25 kills, you get something you really like.  Yeah.  Tactical nuke.  Yeah, that's a 25-kill streak, which is very hard to do.  But, yeah, the tactical nuke will just, what, wipes the map out? 
[02:21:30]  Yeah, it ends the match.  It's like, wipes everybody out.  Done.  End.  And your side wins and that's it?  Yeah.  How often will that happen, Ant?  To get, to kill 25 people in a row without getting killed yourself is pretty fucking hard, especially on a crowded map.  But, also, something cool they had was the, uh, the slow-mo cam that you get to see, everybody that's playing gets to see the, uh, slow-mo cam video of the last person you got killed.  The last kill, yeah, that, that wins, uh, or loses the game for you. 
[02:22:00]  Um, they show the last kill in slow-mo, so you see a guy come around a corner and just get, bam, blasted.  The best one will be when a guy throws a grenade and it, uh, doesn't blow up and it bounces off their head and kills them.  Right on.  Thank you, Scott.  Uh, I want to give some other people a chance.  It's Brian in Jersey.  Brian.  Hey, how you guys doing?  Good, Brian.  Welcome aboard, Brian.  We're doing all right, you know.  I took the whole week off the phone.  Not bad, tired, but cool.  How was your turn, Fish?  You all right?  Good, thank you.  All right.  Hey, Opie, if you want, I got, I'm getting it for the PS3 and the Xbox, so if you want, I'll meet you online and play. 
[02:22:30]  Oh.  What's the problem with the PS3?  Wow, there's got to be tens of people on PS3 playing.  What's the problem with the PS3 these days?  The network is not as good as the Xbox.  No, I know that.  I know that much, at least.  That's a kick's ass.  So what do you got on this game, Brian?  Well, I've been a Call of Duty fan since the PC, so I have every copy for the PC.  I have every copy for the PS3 and the Xbox.  What did you like better, though?  I'm actually going to pick it up right now.  Dude, what did you like better, console control or mouse and keyboard? 
[02:23:00]  Actually, I like mouse and keyboard, but I'm used to the console.  I've been playing the console for about three years because my computer's complete shit.  I can't play any good PC games on it.  I suck dick at fucking the controller.  I get killed.  I am always at the bottom of the list at the end of the game that shows how many kills you got.  You know, the first guy's got like 800 fucking kills.  I'm there, zero kills, killed 80 times.  I'm always that guy because I'm so bad with the fucking console controller. 
[02:23:30]  You used to be good with the PC.  You used to be good with the PC.  But I'm working on it.  I usually average, I only average about anywhere between 10 and 20 kills.  It depends on what kind of streak I get going.  I start off like shit, and then toward the end of the game, after eight hours later,  I'm usually hitting like 20, 22 kills a game.  Yeah, I need a few beers.  You just got to stick with it.  You just got to stick with it.  No, I know.  I started getting pretty good at the first one when I was playing with Bob Kelly and shit like that.  Damn!  And then I laid off for a while, so now I'm back on.  I'm picking it up because when I first put it in last night, I put it in, I really sucked. 
[02:24:00]  Could not do anything.  And by the time I hit it to bed, I was killing a few people and not feeling like a complete fucking asshole.  Have you seen Dane Cook on there yet?  No, I'm waiting.  You used to play with Dane.  Dane is a fucking knifing asshole.  He'll sneak up behind you and stab you in the back every fucking time.  But, dude, you got your coffee, your controller, boom, boom.  No, dude, talk to your friends, you have a few laughs, boom.  You're not hurting nobody, no one's hurting you, boom, dude. 
[02:24:30]  All of a sudden, you realize you're shit, you're pants, the dog is dead, you haven't fed it.  Boom, got your coffee, your cigarettes, everything else unhealthy to help you avoid yourself, boom, dude.  Video games, fishing, boom, computers, anything but Bob.  John in New York, John.  John, what do you got?  Happy birthday, Jimmy.  What's up, John? 
[02:25:00]  What's up?  Did you guys get the night vision goggles that come with the games?  Some of them come with actual night vision goggles.  I have them already.  The big thing now with game releases is you do like a collector's edition like with DVDs,  so you give the consumer a little something extra for a premium price.  So for Modern Warfare 2, they were bundling the actual game with a working real set of  night vision goggles, I think for about 200 bucks, so you could walk around and just see  in the dark.  That's pretty fucking cool.  It is cool.  I got my night vision and I use it for, in the winter, I have to see if my pool pump is 
[02:25:30]  working to pump the water off the cover.  And if it's raining and dark out, I don't want to go outside and have to look up at  the pool.  So I go to the back door, night vision, and I could see everything, see if it's coming  up.  Yeah, that's why you have it.  You love doing it.  Yeah, that's why you have your night vision goggles.  You love doing it.  Just admit it.  You don't need to check the pool pump.  Military gear.  Dude, do you know how cool everything looks through night vision?  Yeah, it looks like a Paris Hilton sucking dick.  There's something great about when they don't know they're being filmed. 
[02:26:00]  Let's go to Sergeant Carson from Fort Bragg.  That's it?  Sergeant Carson.  How are you doing, guys?  Good.  Better now, sir.  Sarge.  It just fucking disgusts me, all these kids.  I got a 25 kill streak.  You know, if you want to play Army, join the fucking Army.  I'm too old.  Well.  For a lot of things.  You guys are just saying that as a basic thing.  You guys think your car, your lifestyle.  You guys think this is a good recruiting tool, though, for the youngsters?  You think some people jump in the game and go, you know what? 
[02:26:30]  Not necessarily.  Why not?  The Army has a game that they put out.  But I'm just saying, does this get kids out there?  Not all of them, obviously.  Maybe.  You know, interested in the military.  There is a game, though, that is put out by the United States Army.  Right.  And it's called America's Army.  America's Army.  Yeah.  America's Army.  Yeah.  And it's instead of just a run and shoot thing, it's very team oriented. 
[02:27:00]  Yeah.  You got it.  You got it.  You can't just run and gun.  It uses tactics.  It tries to show a little more what it's about than just running into some place and throwing  a grenade and blowing shit up.  And it is run by the fucking army.  And it is a recruiting tool.  Yeah.  No, they also have the Special Forces version, which is actually very boring.  You get a high score and they get a knock on your door.  They take your kid.  You're ready.  You just come and take your kid away from you. 
[02:27:30]  I don't know.  It's just really unrealistic.  Yeah.  No, I think people know that, dude.  It's like it's a game.  And it's unrealistic because you can get shot up.  And if you find cover quickly enough, in three seconds, you're OK again.  I don't think anybody's thinking that's how it really works.  But it's just it's very fun and competitive.  And I think it's the same reason people like playing paintball and things like that.  It gives that it's competition.  And it's very cool. 
[02:28:00]  It looks good.  It's a fun game to play.  And the weapons are great.  But, you know, I don't think anyone's really getting confused, to tell you the truth.  All right.  Thank you.  I think terrorists are playing Sergeant Carson.  Thank you to learn things.  Let's go to Chris.  I'm going to Sergeant Carson.  Chris, what do you got?  Hey, how you doing, guys?  Hey, man.  Well, I just drug my 11-month-old in her pajamas into the local GameStop to pick up my copy.  And they had business cards and paraphernalia joining the Army right there on the right next 
[02:28:30]  to where you sign on the dotted line.  They know.  See, they're hoping.  So they got a little literature laying around.  I didn't even saw it since Saturday, they told me.  No kidding, Anthony.  It's fun, not real.  Yeah.  Yes, I know.  I was just being a little obvious there.  Ed.  Ed.  Asshole.  Hi, Ed.  Today is November 10th, the Marine Corps birthday.  I'd just like to say 75 to all our troops.  Hoorah!  Hoorah!  Are you a Marine, sir?  Hoorah!  Are you a Marine?  Yes, sir.  Where's the Fifth General Order? 
[02:29:00]  Uh.  I got out 10 years ago, bud.  All right.  Right on, Ed.  Thank you for that.  Thank you.  All right.  Fifth General Order.  Let me say, is this the Sonny Sonny?  What was the purpose of looking down the barrel before handing the Sonny?  Hey, yeah.  Hey, guys.  You're born again hard.  Yeah.  We were talking about the first game there.  Talking about how this might influence kids into joining the Army and the military.  Yeah.  I got a 16-year-old son. 
[02:29:30]  I had to pull the game away from him because it was so addictive.  But he wants to actually join the Army now.  Well, some people will.  A few people that turned on to the military to these games.  If you join thinking that it's going to be like the game, wow, you're fucked.  I know, but he kind of has all of, you know, he wants to also become a cop, too.  So, I mean, it's kind of like in the right direction.  Yeah, that's it.  Like, I think it's more that people that will join the Army anyway are buying the game instead  of all the way around. 
[02:30:00]  Yeah.  You know something?  I got to feel, no, if you bought, like, GTA 4, he would have been a car thief.  A car thief and murderer?  Yeah, yeah.  Hooker fucker?  Or just...  Oh, yeah, that's true.  All right, Sonny, thank you.  Sonny Farrelly from Boston.  This cum sock kind of feels nice on your...  You like it on your arm?  Yeah.  It's like a little cast.  It looks like a little cast.  Yeah, it could be used as a cast once it's crusty with jizzing because you've been jerking  off so much.  It makes its own cement.  If you put it on, it makes its own cast to help you heal so you could jerk more. 
[02:30:30]  Then you guys could sign my cum cast.  With our faces.  Am I right or wrong, boys?  You're always right, Jimmy.  You're always right, Jimmy.  You could just keep using it until it turns into a gauntlet.  Yeah, you'd smack people like a bracer.  It deflects bullets.  There's a list out.  Wonder homo.  I'm trying to find out where the list came from.  Is this Rolling Stone insurance?  A list?  New York songs.  The top New York songs of all time because Jay-Z has this big song, Empire State of Mind. 
[02:31:00]  Does he?  So they figured, well, we should make a list of other New York songs.  And the list sucks.  I don't even know if we should do this.  I don't think any of us in this room know a bunch of these songs.  Let's just do the top two.  You ever hear Simon Garfunkel doing a song called The Only Living Boy in New York?  It's a great song.  No, it's not.  It is.  Jimmy, you're so...  The only...  Simon and Garfunkel or Garfunkel and Garfunkel.  The only...  Are the ones you know. 
[02:31:30]  Are the other ones that didn't make it?  Didn't make it for a reason.  What is their problem now?  Simon and Garfunkel always sing about a problem.  If we gave Sam a fucking horseshoe haircut, he would look just like Art Garfunkel with the frizzy hair.  How about the show demands that Sam get a fucking horseshoe? 
[02:32:00]  Get the Art Garfunkel.  Sam will get the Art...  Look, it's Sam's hair, though.  Look at what that would look like.  That would look like Sam.  And that's an older picture of him.  You find one now and it's really crazy.  Art Garfunkel went like front bald and then it just stopped going bald on him for years.  Front bald sucks.  Front bald.  I think I'm going to be front bald guy.  No.  I'd rather be back bald guy. 
[02:32:30]  Back bald?  Because you can kind of hide that a little bit.  Alright, let's...  That's a wonderful song by Simon and Garfunkel.  Whatever it is.  Going to move through this list real fast.  Harry Nielsen.  I guess the Lord must be in New York City.  Never heard of it.  Never heard of that.  No, the Lords are.  It was my old gang.  Ah, the Lords.  Ew, it was.  Ew.  You don't like the Lords?  What fucking year were you born in?  In the 50s?  I don't know.  Hey, we're with the Lords.  Watch out, we're the Lords.  Hey, we're meeting up with the chaperones to rumble later.  What were the other gang names? 
[02:33:00]  There were none.  There were none.  You were the only gang.  What a tough guy.  Is that a bad gang name?  Oh, it's horrible.  For suburban nerds?  The Lords.  Oh, did you have jackets?  Not yet.  No, me and...  We didn't want to do it.  Did you plan and like...  Did you fantasize and dream about having cool jackets?  No, me and my friend, we were going to build our hangout.  Yeah.  Our fort.  Yeah.  And our two friends started on it, and me and my friend Frank went to the store to buy  the letters for the clubhouse sign. 
[02:33:30]  I can't even look at you.  Oh, the Lords.  Hey, Lords.  How else is the mailman going to know where to deliver the Lords mail?  God damn it.  They're out of D's.  We're the Lords.  The Lords.  Yuck.  You suck.  Why?  The Lords.  You don't want to tangle with the Lords, bub.  I guess not.  That's right.  Building a clubhouse.  And you mess with the Lords.  You'll have to deal with the consequences. 
[02:34:00]  Silhouette of a boy sucking a dick on the back.  Those are your colors.  Oh, the Lords.  That's terrific.  All right.  Well, the list continues.  The New York songs.  R.E.M.  Leaving New York.  Anyone?  Anyone?  Anyone?  I don't know what that is.  All right.  Number 12, Beastie Boys, an open letter to New York City.  This got some play a couple years ago.  Did it?  You know what song I like playing about New York?  ACDC.  Fucking I Feel Safe in New York City.  That ain't on the list, Jimmy.  Of course not.  Can we get a little taste of Beastie Boys, an open letter to New York City? 
[02:34:30]  You know this one.  Listen, all you New Yorkers.  It sucks.  What is this?  Beastie Boys.  Oh.  Beastie Men. 
[02:35:00]  You know what?  It's taking so long.  Stop it.  The Beastie Older Gentlemen.  Stop it.  Give a shit.  Language.  Number 11, Sting, Englishman in New York.  Oh, I hated this song.  Why did you hate this?  Because it just sucks.  Let's see how the Englishman handles New York.  It's all francy.  He's such a pompous ass.  Sting.  Ugh.  I like his music. 
[02:35:30]  I don't like him as a person.  My dear.  Like my toast on one side.  This isn't that bad, though.  A little boring, but not terrible.  Shut up.  Who cares that you're an Englishman in New York?  Go fuck yourself.  Go tantric.  Fuck your wife for 10 hours and don't come.  Dummy.  Wait a minute.  Coming feels great.  Just stick it in and come.  Yeah, what's wrong with you?  What's wrong with you?  Dummy.  I remember him being a great fuck. 
[02:36:00]  Right.  The best part of fucking is coming.  You know how many times you could come in 10 hours, you dummy?  Don't be stupid.  Right.  Let it loose.  You're, you're, New York is the only place where you don't know who, everyone just blends  in.  Yeah, who cares?  You're not sticking out in New York because you're an Englishman.  No.  I like the fact that you were going to say Englishman, but you said it like him.  Because you're an Englishman.  Englishman.  Englishman.  I'm an Englishman.  Number 10. 
[02:36:30]  Top New York songs of all time.  Rolling Stone really did not need to do this list just because Jay-Z has a hot song out  there right now.  Word is wrong.  Uh, Genesis back in New York City.  This is, uh, this is a very, very old school, uh, Genesis.  This is Genesis.  Would this be off the Lamb Lies Down on Broadway?  Whoa.  I don't know.  Not really positive about it.  Yeah?  Thumbs up for me?  Thanks.  Don't know it.  I, I kind of remember this song. 
[02:37:00]  I know.  Because I was into early Genesis for a while.  All right, number nine.  Kevin from Connecticut is, uh, asking if, um, Jesse Jackson's Heimietown made the list.  Heimietown is on the list.  I'll tell you what number it is.  Did Jim Norton make it?  I'm a Heimie in New York.  What?  Jim Norton got an honorable mention.  Did he?  Yes, he did.  Do we have it?  Why?  Top New York songs of all time, according to Rolling Stone Magazine.  Oh, I bet I know what this is.  Norton's got it.  We're back, back in the New York roof. 
[02:37:30]  We're back, back in the New York roof.  Welcome back to the OBN Anthony Show.  You should have continued that song.  I know.  It's the perfect length. 
[02:38:00]  The beauty is, Jimmy is playing the drums as he sings.  Yeah.  Multitasking there.  You couldn't tell with the staccato vocals.  How did fucking Back in the New York Groove by H. Freely not make it?  How do you know it didn't make it?  You're right, but I'm assuming it didn't.  Because Rolling Stone Magazine sucks a fucking, they suck a neat pile of dicks.  Wow.  Stacked up like cordwood.  All right, you're right.  It didn't make it.  Number nine, Bruce Springsteen making Roland very happy.  New York City serenade.  Stick to Jersey, you fuck. 
[02:38:30]  What are you doing in fucking New York?  Yeah.  What is he singing about in New York?  In the state that's next to Jersey.  We get it.  You work Wendy into it.  It's bordering states.  Me and Wendy went to a Broadway show in New York, and we took the bridge because it's  separated by water to get to Jersey, Wendy.  Whoa, whoa, whoa.  I thought, well, you...  Oh.  Why is this better than New York Groove? 
[02:39:00]  Fuck Rolling Stone and their fucking asses.  This is shite.  Down, down, down, down.  You think?  You think he kicks in?  Down, down, down.  In the suffering madness.  That's what it sounds like.  Okay, you self-serving poppy shit.  Don't kiss off Roland  This is a reader's list  Nothing worse than a reader's list  Actually a reader's list is better than a fucking Rolling Stone list 
[02:39:30]  That's the gangbang  Gladiator, gladiator, gladiator  Before she went to the gangbang  How much do you fucking love John Valby  When I was younger  And in my prime  I used to gangbang all the time  Knock knock  Who's there?  Fuck you  Fuck you  Fuck you  He's such a pig

Who the fuck would listen to this?  Are you holding up nine fingers?  It's a nine minute song  Roland is an idiot  For liking this  No I was just saying  Oh  Oh he likes this?  Yeah he's stupid for that  I've never fucking heard this song in my life  This is self-serving drivel 
[02:40:30]  No one's playing this  Please tell me he never sings  How great would that be?  I don't sing in this song  People play piano  And I play guitar  Clarence plays the horn  And we just sit around  And do self-serving shit  That no listener would ever want to hear  Oh there you go 
[02:41:00]  Oh fine  Shit  I'm in my Cadillac  Yeah  We're driving  Down the Jersey Shore  Holy shit  Yawn  Yawn  Z  Z  Z  Z  Oh  She's  Oh  Into this tunnel of shit 
[02:41:30]  It stinks  Alright turn this off  So soft  The list continues  It only gets better  Rolling Stone just fucking stinks  To a point that it's an enraging magazine  Bleh  I can't even think of good New York songs  But they figured they had to make a list  I know exactly what's going to be on that list  And I don't know  I want to know the order  Don't tell me  But New York State of Mind  Billy Joel will be on there  Alright  New York New York will be on there  Empire State of Mind will be on there  New York Group won't be

[02:42:30]  Oh fuck  30,000 fans  Saw Bruce play this song  While he and his Puerto Rican friends  Celebrated their Yankee victory  Oh really  That song  That's apparently what was happening  Played it live  30,000 fans  Had to sit through a nine minute  Had to sit through that fucking shit  No fucking way  No I bet the vocals came in a little quicker than that  Roland  How'd you know it was Roland?  Yeah  Did he spell their Roland?  Yeah  He didn't put the right form of their 
[02:43:00]  Listen Roland  It should be T-H-E-I-R Roland  Not T-H-E-R-E  Yeah  Great  God  And then they actually set a record for 30,000 people snoring at once  No?

[02:46:00]  Because Rolling Stone fucking blows  Yeah, I'm out at Brooklyn  Now I'm down in Tribeca  Right next to the narrow  But I'll be hood forever  I'm the new Sinatra  And since I made it here  I can make it anywhere  Yeah, they love me everywhere  I used to cop in Harlem  All of my Dominicanos  Right there up on Broadway  Pull me back to that McDonald's  Took it to my stash spot  560 State Street  Catch me in the kitchen  Like the Simmons whipping pastry  Cruising down A Street  All white Lexus  Driving so slow  But BK is from Texas

[02:49:30]  I'm suited up with street clothes  Hand me and I'm out of the P-coes  It's not bad  Shooting drugs and their fucking money in cars  Shut up  Bill Maher had a fucking really good point one time about rap though  Did he?  Yes  I won't repeat it here  But he's saying how rappers are the only fucking guys in music left who are honest about their agenda  Oh yeah?  Like rockers have turned into such fruits  And they talk about guns and pussy and that's just what they want to do  I think that's just him placating  That's all he's doing 
[02:50:00]  It's like, look at me, look at me complimenting the black man  I hate him  And his big fucking granite wall forehead  His cliffs of Dover head  Fuck him  Alright, let's  I don't know if this list is exhausting  What else?  My God, where are we?  Number two, Ryan Adams, New York, New York  Which means Frank Sinatra did not make the list, Anthony  But the song did?  No, this is just  Oh  Has the unfortunate saying 
[02:50:30]  New York, New York didn't make the list  No  That's all, it's a reader's poll, so  And number one would be  Billy Joel, New York State of My  I'm in a  New York State of My  I'm in a  New York  State of My  State of My  Oh yeah, that part's good  And that's it for that  Wow, who knew?  We're gonna go back to  Oh, the David Hasselhoff audio is really good  Yes, I want to hear him all hammered  At the MTV Europe Music Awards  And then we didn't do the Agassi or the Rihanna audio 
[02:51:00]  Uh, I want to hear drunk Hasselhoff  We're gonna do that after the break  Yeah  And then maybe at least get some Agassi  Him talking about smoking the crystal meth in that weird fucking wig of his  Yeah, huh?  Yeah  And then maybe Rihanna getting  Every time  Yeah  It used to fall off  And I told him, you gotta use glue  Use the wig glue  Yeah  And he said, it still comes off when I play tennis  I said, how about a headband?  Yeah  That was me  My dear  Headband and some Elmer's glue 
[02:51:30]  It'll never fall off again  One time I was doing jumping jacks and a ceiling fan took it off  I had to get shorter lifts  And a smaller wig  It doubled my size  Yeah, I went with a big wig and big lifts  Yeah  Mistake  Bumping into ceiling fans  Yeah  And heaters and overhead valances  People knew it was a wig because it was turquoise  Turk?  What? 
[02:52:00]  Rooster  Like, you know, many of you on Thanksgiving will have turkey  As long as you don't have rooster  Oh, shit  See me at Tribeca Film Festival  I love New York  Yeah  You know, I'm in a New York state of mine  But I guess you knew that  It's just the worst thing 
[02:52:30]  It's horrible  Talking off the cuff  All right  He should just shut his fucking face  Yes  Here's Agassi talking about the wig  His image, he says now, was all a facade  Oh  Including his hair  Oh, his front  It started to fall out when he was just 17  Oh, so you know what I mean  So he got a hair weave  Terrified people would learn the truth about his trademark mane  What this could mean if people found out  Or what does it really mean to my endorsement companies 
[02:53:00]  What's it mean to my overall image  What's it mean to me  What's, you know  I was living a fraud  I mean, I was just living  Is this Steve C  How the fuck didn't we know it was a fucking  Living a fraud  How did we not know that was a hair weave  No one did  Everyone just thought he had this wild mane of fucking hair  And assumed it was real  You know what  He must have spent a tidy dime on that fucking shit  Because you couldn't tell 
[02:53:30]  You couldn't tell  The night before  The unthinkable happened  His hairpiece literally fell apart in the shower  And Andre and his brother frantically put it in place  With a slew of bobby pins  Yeah  First time I ever really prayed for anything  As it related to a result  I was praying not for the wind  But for my hair to stay on  Were you afraid it was just going to fly off?  Scared the heck out of me  I kept envisioning what this would be like  If my hair just flew off  And landed  Like what would I do 
[02:54:00]  Would I go over and kill it  Or would I  Would I quickly put it back on  Would I take it home and name it  I don't  I didn't know what I was going to do  I didn't have a plan for what I was going to do  Which is why I was trying to move less and less  Because the last shot  It kind of just  You just sort of stood there  Oh yeah  When the match was over  I had won  Just because your hair had stayed on  Because my hair had stayed on  Jesus Christ  He's so fucked up  Holy shit 
[02:54:30]  He's just standing there with the racket  Still head  Don't move  Please hair  I guess his father was one of those  Fucking dads  Like the great Santini  Whatever man  Yeah  Yeah because  His father built something called the dragon  Listen to this  It was really scary  Especially to a seven year old  Shooting tennis balls  At 110 miles an hour  At a seven year old boy  110 miles an hour  Because my dad  Put a souped up  Yes  That's what I told him  Shooting balls at the kid  I hit the ball that hard back then 
[02:55:00]  He was a maniac  He was a mad scientist as well  Was it at that age you decided  I hate tennis  It always came with a level of anxiety  It always came with a level of pressure  None of it really made sense to me  So  I don't ever remember really  Not hating it  Did Brooke Shields know he didn't have hair?  I would hope so  She was fucking him  I know  That's just it  Let's get into the Brooke Shields  Runs his fingers through his hair  And just comes up with a fucking tribble 
[02:55:30]  Sounds like the guy  Never really  Had the marriage end  Well you know  I mean she was a model  And two weeks later  She ran out of the house  Screaming with a handful of wig  He would shower  And fucking hang it on the door  Like a hat  She'd fucking look at him  Like Pesci sleeping in JFK  I heard he kept it on  With marmalade  Did I say that once?  No  Okay  I just wish you had  It would kind of work  Marmalade is wonderful  It would kind of work  Marmalade helps it slip off 
[02:56:00]  I tried it once  On the set of 88 minutes  Really Al?  Yeah  Put a little marmalade on the head  All the June bugs were nipping at my forehead  You'll see marmalade dripping down his forehead  Yeah  Sneeze  I got marmalade in my eyes  Yeah  Couldn't do shots  Because of the fruit flies  All over the place  Yeah  I tipped my wig to the queen of England  A bunch of fruit flies landed on her  It was embarrassing  Yeah  Bobby De Niro and me  Having a fun interview 
[02:56:30]  He said  He crinkles the papers  That makes funny New York remarks  Holy shit man  Hey give him my shoes  I mean stilts  Yeah  Is this the match where he  I think so  Yeah this is the 1990 US Open final  His wig was going to fall off  Yeah we're looking at some footage there  He's not  He really isn't moving his head much  He could have dove for that one  Yeah  He doesn't want to dive for nothing  He dives  Hits the wig  And the ball over the net  You know  They said that his hair was starting to fall out at 17 
[02:57:00]  Yeah  After what his dad did to him at 7 years old  Yeah no shit  No surprise there  The fucking stress his dad gave him  Did he win or lose this match?  He lost huh?  Wow  Oh  Because he was afraid of losing the wig  Yeah it looks like he's losing to Paco  Moreno from Bad Boys  No he's not running for the  He's not running for  He is petrified  That how fake looking is that wig?  Now it looks really fake  Jesus  How great would it be if it just fell onto the court  During the French Open 
[02:57:30]  That's a very believable wig  Looks like a mink stole  I love doing Paco  It's just so funny  It's so much fun  Bunch of bobby pins  Bobby pins  I use them  So you better be careful  Or the raging bull  Shut up  You want to hear him talking about the crystal meth?  We're into the agassi audio 
[02:58:00]  We won't play all of this a lot of times  A little observation  Someone picked up on his feedback as well  I was thinking that he sounds a bit like Kevin Smith in this interview  If you listen closely  Yes  According to his book  When his assistant asked him if he wanted to get high  And offered him a white powder  An illegal highly addictive drug called crystal meth  Andre says he was in such a bad way  He agreed  My decision was  Why not?  Can't feel any worse 
[02:58:30]  There was a sadness that came with it initially  Followed by, you know, the energy and a chemically induced reconnection to life  I was looking for anything to make me get off the couch  To make me, you know, re-engage in life  Did you think about the ramifications?  We gotta stop  He's six inches of color  Look, we gotta stop  If you look at the video  His hair is fucking getting higher and higher on his head  And it's not even just the top 
[02:59:00]  Like, the sides are pulling up  How did we not know this?  How the fuck did we not know?  That is so obviously a wig now  Because it's coming off of his head  And by the way, the people around him  Great secret keepers  They're better than altar boys  Fucking, uh  Didn't say a word  Yeah, I meant to say that  I fucked up  But he has like a headband on  Which is kind of keeping it on his head  But it's also making it like  But it's moving up  Yeah, it's ready to snap  Like one of those  Japanese  Samurai guys  Just a little ponytail on top of it  He's got a ponytail with his fake hair 
[02:59:30]  With his fake hair  See, that's a good wig  Eat that in the Jeff Foxworthy section  Oh my god, it's so bad  And then, I remember that  Remember that he came in back one year  And he just was shaved  He had a complete shaved head  And all I was thinking was  Why would some guy  Who has a fucking huge head of hair like that  Shave it?  Like, that's gotta piss off bald people  And you knew that it  You could see that he was bald, too  Yeah, what the fuck  Even though he shaved his head  Yeah  One time, did I tell you 
[03:00:00]  I was doing a movie  Funny Story  And Bobby and I are on the set  And a big crow came down  And took my wig  I was gonna be mad  But he made a little nest for his kids  Yeah  A bunch of little birds living in it  Least I could do  Kept them alive  When the mama's away  They licked the marmalade  I don't know why marmalade  Marmalade  It's always funny  You know, re-engage in life  Did you think about the ramifications? 
[03:00:30]  Yes, very much so  While you were doing it?  Of course not  With Spring Katie  How do you think about that?  I knew what I was doing  But tennis wasn't a concern to me  Because I didn't care about tennis  You know, my own body  Wasn't really that much of a concern to me  Because I didn't think that highly of myself  Jesus  This guy had some fucking issues  Because he had a wig  Yeah  This guy has a lot of fucking issues  Do you know the reaction that would have got  If he would have won  And just took the wig off  And threw it  And waved at everybody  Wow  Walked off  The announcers just would have been like  Oh my god  Oh my god 
[03:01:00]  Oh my god  Oh my god  His hair came off  King  How'd you say that?  I can't believe it  How many times did you do crystal meth?  You think?  You know, it was a  It was a foggy time in my life  For a lot of reasons  The simple answer is  I don't know  I did it way too many  Yeah, no one counts, Katie  You know you  No one knows how many times  Shut up  Katie, you dummy  I did it for a good part of 1997  Better part of the year  Starting early in the year
