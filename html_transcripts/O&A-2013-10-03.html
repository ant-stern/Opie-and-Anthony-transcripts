<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show began with the hosts repeatedly shouting the show's name before launching into crude jokes.  Opie discussed his new Sony Wi-Fi camera, contrasting it with older photo transfer methods. Anthony recounted a night court experience where he got a reduced speeding ticket through a seemingly arbitrary process, unexpectedly encountering a judge who had employed his father years ago.  He also detailed the agonizing experience of completing a mandatory online driving safety course designed to prevent cheating.

The annual "Jocktober" segment was heavily featured. The hosts launched a scathing critique of Cindy and Jimmy from Star 94, resulting in their Facebook page being overwhelmed and subsequently taken down by Opie and Anthony listeners' obscene comments.  A detailed review of the movie *Gravity* followed, with praise for its visuals and acting.  The hosts discussed the government shutdown and Anthony promoted his upcoming comedy shows. This segment concluded with a previously aired surprise performance by Chubby Checker playing "The Twist" for Jim Norton's birthday, preceded by a humorous negotiation about the song choice.  Jim Norton and a future appearance by Megan McCain were frequently mentioned.

Next, a motorcycle accident involving a large group of bikers and an SUV driver was dissected, with the hosts noting the racial biases in public opinion surrounding the incident.  Multiple video angles were analyzed, revealing the inconclusive nature of the available footage.  The hosts debated the relative fault of the bikers and the SUV driver.  A lengthy in-studio segment with Dennis Falcone followed, showcasing his collection of old radio recordings.  Falcone played snippets of New York radio broadcasts from the 60s, 70s, and 80s, highlighting the stylistic and content differences from modern radio.  Numerous photos of Falcone with celebrities were shown, and the segment concluded with more audio from his collection.  The upcoming appearance of Meghan McCain and a running gag about a late guest were also noted. A podcast promotion involving a man stuck in a bathtub with a dildo was also mentioned.

A "Jocktober" focused segment featured audio clips from deceased radio personality Bob Dayton, including a joke about Hiroshima, sparking a discussion on evolving standards of political correctness in radio.  The firing of WABC DJ Robby Young for teasing Paul McCartney's death was discussed, followed by the playing of audio from "The Mad Daddy Show," which was heavily criticized for excessive reverb.  A poorly received Jocktober segment prepared by coworker Denny led to considerable on-air criticism of Denny's work and a discussion about his future on the show.  A 911 call recording featuring a laughing dispatcher was played, prompting a discussion about professionalism.  A lighthearted segment on pet clothing followed, along with audio clips from a morning radio show, Mike and Stephanie on CK105 in Flint, Michigan, characterized by awkward banter and random tangents, including gorilla mating habits. The segment ended with the news that the CK105 Facebook page was deactivated.  Throughout, profanity and vulgar language were prevalent.

The show then moved to a seemingly pointless phone segment about favorite pizza places in Genesee County, which the hosts expressed extreme apathy towards. This was followed by further criticism of this and a similar ice cream segment.  Despite their disdain, numerous callers participated. A fun fact about pizza orders (36% include pepperoni) led to more crude jokes.  The conversation shifted to sexually suggestive comments about a 17-year-old listener, Sam (or Samantha Jo Mero), whose birthday they had missed.  

Meghan McCain then joined the show. The conversation initially revolved around Sam Roberts’ interview with McCain.  Discussion turned to McCain's show, "Raising McCain," her relationship with her father, John McCain, and challenges in the political sphere. Political views on various figures (Joe Biden, Hillary Clinton, Jeb Bush, Marco Rubio, etc.), gun control, and the state of American politics were discussed.  McCain also shared anecdotes about her Playboy interview and her father's reaction. The conversation touched upon Jim Norton's weight loss, a past television appearance with Stephen Baldwin, Ariana Huffington, and Diablo Cody, and concluded with further discussion about McCain's show and personality. Profanity and vulgar language were used throughout this segment.

The final segment focused on past interviews, both good and bad.  Anecdotes included Louis C.K. and Amy Schumer (with a story about Schumer and a cab driver), a contentious interview with Jesse Ventura (featuring his fanny pack and a 9/11 argument), a "terrible" interview with Paris Hilton, and other bad interviews with Ludacris, Terrell Owens, Screech, and "Balloon Guy."  George Wendt's interview is recalled as uncomfortable, sparking conversation about his potential alcoholism.  Anthony Weiner's sex scandals were discussed, praising his refusal to back down during an interview.  Other guests mentioned included Chris Christie, Larry Craig, JFK, Tom Sizemore, Kristen Bell, Linda Blair, Amanda Peet, Bobby Brady, Meadow Soprano, Sugar Ray Leonard, a midget stripper, and Cinnamon Love.  A contentious phone call with Ben Stein, involving a misunderstanding over the phrase "chew down," was also played. The segment revealed the hosts’ candid views on their interview experiences with various high-profile figures.  The show ended with more profanity and vulgar language.

[00:10:30]  turned off the parkway right and um it was probably maybe 10 o'clock at night i made the left onto  glencove road and it's completely straight and i'm just like i i just want to open this thing up get  the fucking supercharger whining going through the gears and then i go to make the turn to go into 
[00:11:00]  my little neighborhood and i just see lights fucking like reflecting off the trees i don't see him  behind me yet but i know he's he's coming so that's when you gotta keep going i should have ran  because i could have just gone like really fast and then got into my garage like i could have  and shut the garage door and fucking game over he wouldn't know where you were go to pay and spray  pay and spray takes care of that shit and it doesn't matter if he knows where i am  it wasn't me driving that's right someone had my car that's right i left it out back yesterday and  when we woke up it was gone and then they go oh really you know open the garage and then of course 
[00:11:30]  you open the garage and your car is a different color and they're like oh fuck all right all right  you see the stars go down it's fucking so satisfying but they stay around just a little bit  all confused and then they take off and they leave sure sure yeah so uh so i got that ticket  and um and a ticket for uh no front license plate which by the way i'm not putting a fucking front 
[00:12:00]  license plate on my mustang well it's just another scam it's fucking they came up with because they  know a lot of guys have really nice cars and they don't want that front license plate so fuck that  they know they could just collect money all day long well so uh fucking assholes enough already  yeah how much money do you need from us so i have this court appearance apparently they do night court  it starts at seven really at night yeah so i go there and um oh boy the collection of degenerates  in a courtroom at any given moment kind of jealous a little um no offense there mars but wow 
[00:12:30]  a lot of your peeps a lot of your peeps that drive around with no fucking license apparently  because that was like the charge of the fucking night a bunch of people that came up with someone  else because they don't speaky and uh they have to translate one guy comes up and he's like uh  no english and his friend goes um uh i'm here to help him and the judge is like  we'll see if you need help if he needs any of your help uh uh ustedes and he starts like speaking 
[00:13:00]  there's really the the judge was uh about 80 years old 80 years old he's very old and there's a story  to him too that i'll get to but um so a bunch of people are going up and and now i have to deal with  you got to go in the back with the prosecuting attorney uh who goes with everybody and you know  you knock shit down you make a deal you do something so i went in the back there and um 
[00:13:30]  she goes what did you did you fix the license plate i'm like yeah she goes you got proof i go yeah but i  go i don't have the proof it's in the shop it's some line of shit she goes okay well you're gonna  get it fixed right i'm like yes of course and she goes the speeding thing she goes i see you have  another speeding ticket here on your record and uh she goes all right look we'll we'll take it and  we'll put it down to a um illegal lane change for three points instead of speedo for six points 
[00:14:00]  i gotta interrupt yeah but you didn't do that i know i don't understand how they could just do that  dude they were giving i'm happy they did because it works in your favor but yeah that's just like  nonsense they were doing shit last night it's like you didn't make an illegal fucking lane change i  know you were speeding the judge is doing this last night all fucking night right he's going uh  so you spoke with the prosecutor and she has informed me that you are withdrawing your not  guilty plea on the charge of illegal lane change for somebody that did do an illegal lane change 
[00:14:30]  illegal lane change uh in lieu of pleading guilty on a charge of no parking and they're like yes yes your  honor they're like yes sir he goes okay 85 dollars with a 25 dollar surcharge instead of points and all  night long it was no parking no parking no parking why can't they say uh you know you were speeding but  we have decided right well then you don't get the points i know but we're not going to give you points 
[00:15:00]  to make it something where it's not at least have the charge in the in the book that you actually did  but then somehow have a workaround where okay we acknowledge you did this but we have decided to  do this it's the biggest scam ever it's unbelievable they just didn't make an illegal lane change no i  didn't i was speeding it's nuts it was a six point speedo right and uh but i got i got off on a three  point illegal lane change which you did not which i didn't do but it it put me to the big 11 points on 
[00:15:30]  my license 11 fucking points so i have to take i know i have a six point um speeding i have an  what was that one uh that was um on the expressway no i know but how much how fast i guess it was 30  30 miles 30 over so 85 yeah ish fucking six six points and then and then on that i also had a two  point um conversion two point conversion really uh that's pretty impressive not using a blinker but 
[00:16:00]  i was that was the mta fucking guy that pulled me over and got me on that right yeah and gave me a  fucking two point ticket which i for a blinker but i i did use my blinker i might speed but i always use  my fucking blinker and then now the three points puts me at uh 11 points 11 11 so i figure i have to  take this fucking online thing but uh before that so the judge i'm looking at the judge and he's 
[00:16:30]  fucking old as fuck and he's got this uh his little plaque the honorable judge um edward joackham  wow using his real name and everything he's a judge it's it's you know open he's the only old  westbury fucking night court judge all right so uh yeah so uh i'm looking at his name and i'm like  holy shit i know that fucking name i know that fucking name and i know who this guy is and uh i  walk up to the bench and he goes anthony cumia who's joey cumia and i went that was my father and 
[00:17:00]  he worked for you at joackham flanzik and weissman in the early 70s and this guy's eyes popped out of  his fucking head he's like he's like and how do you know that i go because over 40 years ago i was  sitting in your office as a kid wow in front of everybody yeah yeah so what was that a law firm  yeah yeah it was a law firm he was uh he was the private investigator guy oh he was the guy he was 
[00:17:30]  the guy when they needed uh the investigator you're out of work on a bad back thing and  and your father went around it's a little more shady stuff than that even shadier oh yeah oh yeah  like what can you say like marriage stuff uh cheat infidelity um theft uh things like that you know  okay all right uh so the judge remembers your father yeah yeah your father was a character i know i never 
[00:18:00]  met him but it's pretty obvious to everyone he was a character yeah yeah so people didn't forget joe cumia  he goes joe oh yeah he goes uh oh got some great stories and i go i go i've heard i've heard many of  them and then i brought up another guy that was like best friends with my dad that also worked with  him and he's like oh yeah he goes wow yeah i i remember those guys it was and we're having a little  chat at the bench about a little child like the early 70s you should have been clear well it's not up to 
[00:18:30]  him really it's up to that stupid prosecutor and they already made the deal so he just goes through the  motions well can't the judge kind of give a wink and a nod yeah yeah if they're changing charges can  he also go i know and then if he did in the middle of the courtroom like noticing all the people  watching me have this fucking right pal around conversation with the judge uh yeah that was really  fucking weird though it's like there's there's paths crossed back then haven't seen the guy yet  and then all of a sudden if you look at all your life everywhere you went and then all of a sudden 
[00:19:00]  boom your paths cross again it's just an odd thing like that it really is he was uh yeah so so  he uh wished me well uh told me to go in the back and pay uh some money and uh that was that and then  i i went home and signed up for this fucking six hour actually six hours or can you do it in a couple  hours they fucking make it so it's six hours no how right yeah it's online well how how do they make 
[00:19:30]  it six hours you have segments of this thing they're little pieces right and they last you  know this one's four minutes this one's three minutes and no matter how you don't even read it  you you take their dumb tests what do you do uh what's your responsibilities after an accident  run away nothing call your insurance company run away i'm not kidding you so you check these  things can they have another option get your fucking car off the road so they should no one 
[00:20:00]  else is inconvenienced they fucking should as you're waiting for a cop to look at your fender  bender bastards yeah so uh but but here's how they do it they're all timed segments so the little  clock runs down when you when you log into a new page right and it's like this page is four minutes  long so no matter how quick you do it you have to wait for the four minutes to elapse before you  hit the link and go to the next page and now you can't even walk away because every so often at  the beginning you have to answer a fuckload of questions have you ever been to europe uh have you been 
[00:20:30]  to california do you own a dog uh there's a bunch of questions you have to answer and then in  intermittently at random instances during this test it'll pop up and go beep beep and you have  to answer the questions that you answered at the beginning to make sure you're still sitting there  wow what the improv believe it or not has its own test it's the same you know it's a licensed thing  yeah and what they do is they put up the page and it's like oh it's a really long page but it's like 
[00:21:00]  25 minutes and then after 25 minutes you answer like five questions about that whole long page  but for me like i was sitting there and i'd pull up the new page and i'd walk away and watch tv for 25  minutes no this one keeps tabs on you no way dude you took the wrong one no they probably reworked it  because they knew people were fucking cheating this was six months ago that well six months is a long  time oh how much time did you do on it then did i say you done no last night i did probably two hours 
[00:21:30]  oh my god another fucking four hours did you fool around with the time on your computer no kind of  like the candy crush work around candy crush no you're you're you're taking that test like i play  candy crush you gotta wait for new lives that sucks i don't pay attention to anything going on like  like there's videos you have to watch too right like it's like this segment is a video it's 10  minutes long so you turn it on minutes and you hear like the music starts it's like  these old fucking films about all kinds of shit oh you're in hell oh you're in hell it's terrible

[00:30:30]  who nikki yeah she's here i like her she's really nice yeah yeah yeah obviously we we can't be  bothered with interns that's silly that's stupid she's uh she's a lot more professional than yes  the uh previous female interns well we haven't talked to her a lot she's just shy we'll eventually  get to them maybe i don't think she doesn't like being on air or something well she's you know  polite about it i'm surprised jackie's not running here from buffalo wherever she is when we  Rochester we all know where she is she just plops in the chair and starts fucking hi guys yeah she 
[00:31:00]  would just come in pull up a chair relax we're all like all right why don't you get to visit us  what the fuck man yeah she was gonna uh she talked about podcasting i was talking to her  when she was talking about podcast everyone's talking about podcasting but she's actually  someone i think should do it i think my cleaning lady's podcasting at this point and uh i don't  know if she's going to or not but i think it'll be an interesting tie-in if she started but  i don't know if she started or not i do still stand by my step 
[00:31:30]  jimmy saw gravity yeah i saw gravity you got to see it at the imax though huh i saw it in just  regular 3d oh imax 3d i'm kind of jealous because i mean that movie obviously was made for imax 3d  although when we got there of course the top section was reserved seating and we could we still got good  seats because roland hotel is a couple good but i think in the imax it almost doesn't matter where  you sit hmm you're just used to getting that really cool seat in the theater but even if you're way 
[00:32:00]  down or way off to the side the whole fucking thing's right in front of your face yeah that's  just how the technology goes nowadays it was uh it's what when i looked at after the movie i'm like  this is what hollywood does best it was visually it's a masterpiece visually absolutely and i thought  that uh i thought george clooney was great and i thought she was fucking amazing yeah i don't really  like her in movies but she was really good yeah obviously yeah she was amazing she's gonna get 
[00:32:30]  nominated whether she wins or not i don't know you think absolutely there's so much of her in here  and uh it's a real role it's not like just a fluff role that like it's really well yeah really well  acted yeah like it's not just her with a bunch of action there was some there was silence in the movie  at moments that i was surprised at and i liked like where they just show you the fucking the vastness  and the emptiness of space space by being quiet and then you're like oh my fucking god is it you're  alone up there oh man creepy yeah yeah and the way that they move around they show him and her that 
[00:33:00]  they're moving in space and they show you it's a it's it's it looks so hard to do i didn't realize  how violent it was to move around in space you know what i mean yeah fuck yeah they bump into things  pretty hard when they get that momentum going yeah you forget you can't slow down i know but  nothing you do will slow you down oh you just feel like you could just kind of like just  you can't attach yourself nicely you can't swim no that'd be funny there's a lot of just horrendous 
[00:33:30]  bumping going on well there's no air to pushing i mean no well yeah sure wow you liked it huh  loved it yeah i loved it too i really liked it a lot it's supposed to be very good it's probably  going to do very very well it was only an hour and a half if they didn't overdo it it's not a 20  there's not one minute in the film that's wasted no the movie goes by so fast i actually wished it  was a little longer like i would love another 10 15 minutes i really and and i'm not going to give 
[00:34:00]  anything away i'm going to say there's a couple of moments where i thought they were going to do  something that was really going to annoy me and then uh i realized they're not going in that  direction and i was like and it made me love the movie more like fuck they did not fall into this  well cliche um i thought it was great i gotta see that yeah but should i see that i match man  yeah yeah i'm sure in a regular theater it's still good though i mean without 3d did you see with it  without 3d i saw 3d yeah obviously it'll be on screens without the 3d i don't know man still be 
[00:34:30]  cool it'll still be cool but you know just watching a regular movie in a theater nowadays it looks so  dated to me it's amazing it took so long for 3d to take off and then they finally like  use it properly yeah yeah there's a moment but they got to just upgrade their their shit in the  regular theaters you know everybody knows i guess it's way too expensive where they would have done  it by now everybody knows something hits the fuck and we all saw the trailer everybody knows that  they get thrown around you know everyone's seen that yeah yeah but the moment when she's sitting 
[00:35:00]  there fixing something you remember when she was she's close to the screen and you fucking it's  it's an amazing 3d like you're literally just sitting there with sandra bullock in a fucking  space helmet it's so weird and so personal so cool how they because it feels like and she's not even  doing anything she's just repairing something and you're like this is fucking amazing how good this  looks that opening scene before you know all hell breaks loose we're not giving anything away  because it's the whole movie sure was just amazing to watch it was about what 10 minutes maybe yeah 
[00:35:30]  it's great and and the opening shot did you love that beautiful beautiful we explained it on the on  the show i guess monday but you're looking at uh earth from the you know the um i don't know from  space because from just beyond beyond beyond place beyond where the characters were i guess  and then all of a sudden like you just start noticing in the corner a little tiny little fucking  movement that turns into a dot and slowly they took their time to become bigger and bigger and 
[00:36:00]  bigger and you realize holy fuck that's the space shuttle in orbit and then as it gets even closer  and closer now you see george clooney doing an untethered uh spacewalk wow but just how they took  their time with that shot to open the movie was just brilliant yeah it almost had a 2001 like  now i'm not going to say it was not that slow at all but it was it was one of those things where  they really do i don't mean slow in a bad way they took their time i should say but i'm saying i 
[00:36:30]  like that they did that like i liked it like 2001 was slow but it shows how ridiculously vast it is  up there because when you when you're seeing when you're seeing earth from the space shuttle  something you know that's the perspective like oh okay but you don't realize that's just a dot  among many many billions of you know dots the camera work was but when they show them repairing  something you're floating with them and the camera will go like say she she or he or say they're  doing something and the camera floats under and then you can see that just pitch black like with 
[00:37:00]  all the dots of the stars and then it will come back around and then you're looking down at the earth  spinning below and you see this is i it looks like news footage like this is what the astronauts see  and it's fucking holy shit and you didn't get nauseous right i did not get nauseous but i could see how you  would but i'm thinking to myself how did they pull that off because most people will not get  nauseous unlike the stupid cloverfield which we reference a lot on this show because the camera  was steady maybe maybe i don't know wasn't moving yeah i'm surprised i didn't get a little nauseous 
[00:37:30]  because there's a lot of spinning going on the movie's gonna do amazing numbers yeah what a  blockbuster man that was it's better than any of the other movies i think i wonder if that's why  they didn't release it over the summer because of what was coming out maybe they were smart to wait  because i think it's better than any of those movies like oblivion i saw which was good  another isolation movie you know it's like that's what the big thing is now isolation movies  people are also tied in with each other and we're also tech savvy and fucking this these big blockbusters 
[00:38:00]  are about us now just being alone oh no one likes that but that's what i thought of last night  watching this because like uh the jaden will smith movie about just fucking cruise and oblivion this  very minimal cast um in some of these big films pretty good observation mr norton yeah but i loved  it man i loved it i was so happy that i loved it it was different than i thought it would be but i  enjoyed it more than i thought it would the whole thing yeah i thought it was gonna be some hacky  dumb no yeah when you first saw that first you know trail or whatever oh god what could they 
[00:38:30]  possibly do with this you know but yeah oh they figured it out and they could have cheesedicked it up  and they could have and they didn't like there's certain things they could have done which i would  i was so expecting and and i was so happy that they didn't do i'm glad they kept it to an hour  and a half that's pretty good i actually wanted a little bit more i mean that's how much i liked it  greedy yeah that was uh great when does it come out i think i want to say friday oh it is i'll  definitely go see it again without a doubt i gotta see the imax 3d now friday yeah dude it's worth it 
[00:39:00]  to see it there friday friday happy birthday al sharpton oh 59 good for him yeah oh good for you  the um the river now good good for him he's there on a msnbc where do you belong the government  shutdown huh what are we up to day three-ish with uh no end in sight do we have no end in sight  that that's a meeting at the white house yesterday is the headline and how that work obama said look 
[00:39:30]  i'm not negotiating whatsoever and then boehner had to go hi he's not gonna negotiate huh  yeah i do i whatever it's gonna start getting ugly though yeah because this will go into next  week now right yeah i don't know what's gonna happen uh look i say i say to congress you know  stick to your guns you know you've wanted this for many many years a complete separation of the  parties you feel one way they feel the other play it out let's see if you have balls but as soon as 
[00:40:00]  they start realizing that their careers in are in jeopardy watch how all these fuckers start caving  in well that's what they're going to do they're not going to cave in because of the american people  they're going to start realizing wait a minute this is going to hurt me personally and you watch  that's when all this shit gets worked out they're posturing for the next election right they're doing  so but have the balls to play it out a lot of you guys are going to be fucked over it but let's let's  go this is what you wanted they just don't know how to get out of this at this point like the  republicans um i think they realized that their little bid to defund obamacare uh failed and that 
[00:40:30]  was the whole thing for this obamacare is implemented it's in place it's funded it's it's whatever it is  at this point um i i think they they thought maybe they'd get a little more uh fear into the the the  people and um the democrats it didn't work so perhaps they got to start thinking of an exit strategy for  this uh situation um democrats on the other hand you know they can make the republicans look really 
[00:41:00]  bad during this whole thing right and uh when you got the the elections coming up for the midterm  elections you got to really start thinking about you know what you're going to look like what the ads  are going to say you know you know it's not it was never supposed to be about that no of course  as soon as these guys realize oh fuck i might not get reelected they're all going to start caving  they should have one termers uh so they can't you know fight for their goddamn stupid jobs and they 
[00:41:30]  have to fight for uh the country and you know what yeah can we can we continue talking about this but  let's just open a window and talk out a window oh yeah yeah nothing changes nothing we all know  there's major issues down there washington but nothing will ever be fucking changed yeah  bunch of fucking pricks yeah they really are disgusting and they all they know how to get  out of it they just don't know how to get out of it and save face and save face that's what they're  waiting for because they got to save their own asses now and and you can you can you can blame 
[00:42:00]  the republicans but then again you got to look and say well they're doing what their constituency  wants i mean a lot of people on on the right and a lot of people that are republicans uh don't like  the idea of this obamacare it's very expensive uh he him and the administration um lied they they  blatantly lied about what this is and what what it's going to cost uh and you know the republicans are 
[00:42:30]  like no we're doing what our people kind of want so you can't blame them on that front but uh it's  gotten way out of hand no one's doing anything there it's just two-party i told you when i met  ron paul briefly here i i wanted to i want to interview him so bad i'm like uh when are we going  to get out of this he had to have one question i'm like when do you think we're going to get out  of this two-party system that we're stuck in and uh it's like what else do you ask him to and he goes  well you mean we have to get a second party because the other two is the same one 
[00:43:00]  same one oh boy yeah i guess he's right they really are the same fucking person on both sides  there's no difference no difference it's terrible i hate it a lot of guys are out of work though man  and the government a lot of people don't the politicians still get their health care like  while this whole thing's going on they're still taking care of they get paid they're getting paid  through this whole thing they have their own health care which uh they're exempt from the obamacare  thing why because they can make up whatever fucking rules they want  and and any american that looks at that and doesn't see that there's a fucking problem 
[00:43:30]  is blind and stupid they should live like the average american then they would understand what  people are going through that's how they're supposed to represent of course by knowing by  being a citizen right uh whatever it's it's cray it's cray cray yes they are exempt shut up  congress isn't exempt from obamacare yes they are shut up yes they are shut up yes they are shut up  yes they are shut up well there goes that hey man we made a blog huh remember the old days we'd come 
[00:44:00]  we'd come in here and go hey man we made uh i don't know time magazine or or yeah or we're on the  news last night now we get excited when a blog talks about a blog is it a big blog i don't even know  it's uh probably locally yeah in atlanta arch october is getting a little heat already  october yeah i guess somebody reported do you on a blog do you even remember the show we did 
[00:44:30]  yesterday no i never remember i remember they were in atlanta's show and there was a broad that had  maybe a dui thing happening i don't remember the name of the show right right morning mashup  that's right that's what we tell these uh shows don't worry about it it's one day one day hang in  there you can make it for a day and then i swear most of us don't even remember the the name of the  show your names don't worry about it it's nothing personal don't take it so personally but uh this guy 
[00:45:00]  does a radio and tv talk column or or is this a one and done rodney who the headline is opian anthony  mock star 94 cindy and jimmy what why would we do that opian anthony the raucous xm morning host  mock radio tv morning shows from all over the country every october in a bit dubbed joctober  joctober the target this morning cindy simmons and jimmy alexander from star 94 
[00:45:30]  the show takes clips and critique and quote critiques i use the term loosely the show takes  clips and critique them not always in a constructive way how about never in a constructive way i think  it's very constructive yeah stop the hole it's it's an anti-hole campaign that we have going  fucking dumb bitches anti-hole yeah it's ruining radio these stupid program directors 
[00:46:00]  not yokey enough we don't have a lot of holes on uh satellite radio i've i've noticed  the women the women uh that broadcast for sirius xm are a bit stronger jenny hutt  i can't no not really i hear her on that goddamn dr drew show i want to fucking well she's a hole for  dr drew but she is but she's loving the fact she's got a little tv gig so oh i think she can't blame her 
[00:46:30]  takes that liberal angle every time we make fun of nicole for the morning mashup but she's strong  she's a strong woman broadcaster oh she is she's less of a hole in some of the other people on that  show oh man absolutely sam roberts with a fucking right hook yeah but then i'll let them all try to  figure out who i was talking about well she's the strongest gal on that show you think so yeah when  the gals throw the ball around she seems to be the quarterback in the first clip cindy started  singing the first verse of vanilla ice's ice ice baby oh i remember that since that was the 
[00:47:00]  backdrop song introducing the celebrity news segment they noted the irony since the station promotes  itself as the hits without the rap that's right when jimmy talked about how much he likes stealing  vehicles in the new video game grand theft auto 5 cindy notes that stealing cars is illegal in real  life she actually said that this is a terrible game she said with clear disdain as  he raved about it the opian anthony team didn't like her comments feeling she was shutting down 
[00:47:30]  jimmy's enthusiasm it makes me physically ill said comic jim norton part of opian anthony's team  damn jimmy that's right that's right it's fair to say there is probably no overlap between opian  anthony's audience and cindy and jimmy's audience zip opian anthony's a show for guys who like strip clubs  beer and video games wow cindy and jimmy cater to soccer moms with talk about raising kids 
[00:48:00]  shopping and katie perry it's like that fucking bit what was it uh doofus and goofus and gallant  there you go gallant i don't know i don't remember the exact name of that but it's fair to say there's  probably okay we did that so it's no shock opian anthony groaned as they listened to cindy and a  caller who squealed after she won a purse then cindy shared her meal from the night before salmon 
[00:48:30]  parmesan noodles and a mix of squash zucchini and mushrooms opie said she's even a dullard in what  she eats at that point they went online to see what she looked like and agreed cindy's good looking  then thanks to google yes they found a story i wrote i guess this guy wrote in 2006  about her dui and read bits from it i think they liked her more after they discovered she was a 
[00:49:00]  drinker nonetheless they concluded that cindy and jimmy provided morning oh boy milk or toast  milk toast no that's how it's really spelled and that odd no yeah wow i learned something today  milk a toast milk a toast while they were talking about cindy and jimmy opie and anthony's fans  flooded star 94's morning show facebook page with obscene content so the station took the page down 
[00:49:30]  before the bit was even over scott lindy star 94's program director acknowledged the facebook page issue  but declined to comment further oh come on comment further cindy's twitter feed is protected which  means she has to approve each and every person who may view that account's tweets i would include  audio of the bit but there's cursing and such on it you could hear it on youtube starting at the 20 
[00:50:00]  minute point here and they gave a link i guess uh and this is how an opie and anthony fan described it  after posting it on youtube if you thought yesterday's jocktober was lacking this one will  make you happy the target is cindy and jimmy in the morning on star 94 currently down thanks to ona fans  woohoo oh the facebook page okay that's a pretty fair blog it just pretty much says what happened right  and then of course i've left messages with cindy and jimmy though i don't know if either are allowed  to talk to me about it even if they wanted to what about us so that's rodney ho 
[00:50:30]  we have comments we do yay that's our comment he didn't talk to us yeah you should have talked  to us we'd have given you a quote yeah his he wrote return calls from opie and anthony's show  were not returned he didn't want to get back to us he didn't so there you go jocktober's doing well  so far nice i think we might be squeezing into jocktober after the break we have more today 
[00:51:00]  oh yeah we're gonna roll the dice though today oh what are we doing today we're gonna see what a  certain somebody has to offer is he here yet he should be and he's usually well prepared right  oh we we discussed this has he been working on this for a while yeah well you're supposed to be  and we discussed in death yesterday we got a nice ill oh that's funny he said he's got he's  perfect for jocktober though jimmy i know he's got some air checks he's got some air checks that

Chubby, Chubby  Shut up  Chubby, Chubby  E-Rock's on vacation, I guess  That was a great moment on the show  That was for Jim Norton's birthday  I was going to say a few years  It's got to be about five years ago already 
[00:57:30]  Yeah, Joe Nicolini brought him in  Joe Nicolini  Oh, that's right  That was a great moment on the show  Because Chubby Checker came in  Thanks to Joe Nicolini  And he wanted us to play his new song  So bad  Yes  And who cared about his new song?

[00:59:00]  Like who would think Paul Williams would fit in with the radio show?  What a nice guy  Got a lot of positive tweets about Paul Williams yesterday  He's funny  And just the fact that  Like I was texting with my brother and sister yesterday  And the fact that  Like growing up  I'm talking like seven years old  I was doing Paul Williams impressions for my family  And they'd crack up  And it was the same exact impression I was doing fucking yesterday  Right  And then to have him here  It's just an odd little circumstance  I just want him to learn how to play the piano 
[00:59:30]  Play the fucking piano, Paul  Come on  You need the piano to write your songs  Yeah  Or, well, he says he just finds a chord  But wouldn't it be just nice if you're Paul Williams  And you could just like play the piano  Get on air, fucking play the piano  And he's 73 years old  So you would think songwriter  Can't play the piano  You would learn how to play the piano by now  At this point  I wonder why  We didn't ask him why he never decided to play the piano  Or learn how  I think he was more of a songwriter  Yeah, but it kind of goes with each other  It does 
[01:00:00]  You would think, alright  I'll take my time and learn how to play this damn thing  You've got to be able to fiddle around with the fucking piano  To write a song like that  There's Chubby twisting his ass off  So he would play the new song  Yeah, there's no way Chubby can do it  No way  Unless he's paid 10 grand  Alright, then we won't play the new song  Come on, baby  Look at him  He's air guitaring and everything  He almost sprained his ankles  He started twisting so fast 
[01:00:30]  We're watching the video  He's air guitaring  He's twisting  He's all in  Yeah  And the only thing he's thinking right there is  They're going to play my new song  They're going to play my new song  Yeah  As soon as I'm done with this  Did we?  Yes, we did  He played every second of it  Good  Good  Good for Chubby  Yes  Chubby looks great, though  He looked great, yes  Yeah  Oh, so it's his birthday today  I think that's why we played that  Oh, yeah?  Yeah  72  Alright, Chubby  72 for the Chubster  The Chubster 
[01:01:00]  It's so weird to watch him play with the Sabra Cadabra  Doesn't look like his normal band  No  But they worked it out  Oh, they picked right up on it  They sound great together  Yeah  Take it out on the road, guys  I guess if you're a musician  That's a real easy song to play  I would imagine  Yeah, yeah  Yeah, basic, what, blues riff?  Yeah  Yeah  Chubby  There he is  You know  In the big studio with the audience and everything  God damn it 
[01:01:30]  That's why I looked down  Because it hit me, too  I'm like, God, we used to have this thing  Yeah  I don't understand why they think it's better to be in this tiny little fucking spot when we had that  Oh, it was an experience  Sure, we've gotten a few more guests that we probably wouldn't have got, but  I mean, that was like a, that was a media destination  Oh, yeah  Tim Sabian talks about how we're going to be a media destination  I'm like, but Tim, we were a media destination  Yeah, yeah, we were  We had the cameras, we had the live audience 
[01:02:00]  We could pull in bleachers to bring the fans of the show closer to what we were doing  And then when we weren't feeling it, we pushed the bleachers out  Yes  And people came and went  It was an open door  Some days we'd have 100, 200 people there  And other days we had four, five  Those crappy winter days with the walkover  And there was like four people standing by the door  Could you take a picture?  It was so cool, though  Yeah  It was cool  We'd walk over there every day and you didn't know what you got  And then you get the nice days and it was just fucking mobbed 
[01:02:30]  It was just awesome  I don't know why they never  Eh, whatever  We've been over this, right?  Capitalized on that  It'll never come back  No, never, ever  You know how we like bringing up events just to show you how quick time goes?  Uh-huh, oh boy  Ten years ago  Ten years, let me think  The date was 2003  2003  It was October of 2003  That's right  That's the future  That's right  What happened then? 
[01:03:00]  Somebody, um, went to Mars?  Well, no  Venus?  What happened?  Flying car was, uh  No  No?  We've pretty much shut down the NASA program  Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes  That tiger fucking attacked, uh, Mr. Horn there  Wow  That's, uh, ten years  That's a quick  Zigfried and Roy, uh  That was a quick ten, huh?  Tiger guy  How's he doing after ten years? 
[01:03:30]  Oh boy  That thing fucked him up  Remember they were trying to, like, play it down at first?  Yeah  It's like, yeah, he had a problem on stage  But, uh, he should be fine  And then you realize, oh my god  It ate his brain  It, like, fucking  You think that's what it was?  A brain injury?  Yeah, that looks like  I think there was some brain injury there  But also  He was partially paralyzed  Yeah, yeah  There was some punctual wounds  Spinal injuries  And  On his birthday, too  Happy birthday to you  Happy birthday  Oh, yeah  He's 69 today 
[01:04:00]  Wow  Oh, Chipper  Chipper always laughs at that number  Well, you have to  Yeah, yeah  It really is a great number  It's a number for the ages  Chipper loves that number  Right  What number?  69  Fucking keep saying it  No  So I guess we're waiting for Denny  So we can do some Jocktober  Yeah, why would he be ready?  I, uh, I tweeted the other day  I have an account with a couple of different, uh, Twitter accounts  Oh, sure  And I tweeted as Chip  I have Jim, Chip, and Edgar 
[01:04:30]  Yeah  On the same thing  And I tweeted as Chip  But under my own account  And I was fucking horribly embarrassed  Oh, no  You forgot to switch over  Hours later  When I realized  I was like  That was me  Why didn't you delete it?  I just did  Oh, you just did  I did last night  I deleted it  That's funny  Oh, Jimmy  Familiating  Um  You gotta keep your personality separate  Holy fuck, yeah  I think, uh, we finally horrified the people with our latest podcast  What?  Which one was it?  That was a big deal on the Twitter yesterday 
[01:05:00]  Oh, right  I know which one it was  Yes  They're horrified by the wheelchair Fred  Wheelchair Fred  Clip  In the bathtub  A few people saying it's the first time they ever had a tap out  That's why  Who taps out?  That's why I like the podcast  Because we're really bringing back some stuff we just haven't played in a really long time  It's fucking audio  Well, they were depressed by it  Oh, wow  Because I think, uh, I think Fred talks about his homosexuality  Yeah  But he's not gay 
[01:05:30]  He's just desperate  He was so desperate he decided that maybe he could get a guy  This might piss off Fez, by the way, so let's be careful  Oh, boy  But in wheelchair Fred's words, he was so desperate, he said, fuck it, I'm gonna open up, you know, the possibilities  He just wanted anybody  That's right  But we were saying that if that happens, you gotta loosen up your bunghole  Is that how that all came about?  I think it was  He's got, you know, you can't just grab a guy and have him bone you in the ass  Right  He needed to stretch it out with a dildo 
[01:06:00]  Okay  So we had him go  Sometimes I go, you know what, I don't think we're assholes  And then other times it's confirmed  Right  Yes, we are  And then we're reminded, no, we're assholes  Oh, that's how that whole bit went down  I'm pretty sure that's how it went down  I might have to listen to this podcast  He had a practice with the dildo  Right  And, um  And he did in the bathtub  He went in the bathtub  And then realized he couldn't get out of the bathtub  And what are we gonna do?  We're in New York, you're in Boston, so  So deal with it  You know, there's  We might have left him hanging 
[01:06:30]  Yeah  What else could we do, though?  But he was in an accident years ago  And his speech is all fucked up  And he's a gimp  And, uh, wow  That was  His brain was never affected by his motorcycle accident  I'm pushing it in  Ow  Oh, God  It was disgusting  So, go get our latest podcast  Every Wednesday we put up a new podcast  And, uh, this one is  A bit on the horrific side  We also have James Caan telling some great, uh, Godfather stories 
[01:07:00]  Oh, yeah  So we also do, you know, throw a current bit in there once in a while  And then, uh, Brother Joe with an amazing rendition of, uh, the Godfather theme on his guitar  Yeah  As the O&A nugget  Talking, um, I like that James Caan talking about Luca Barazzi  Yeah, man, that was some great inside shit  Oh, my God, yeah  Talking about what a fucking nut he was  Lenny  Yeah, that's pretty cool  What's going on with the motorcycle guy?  I guess, uh, a couple of arrests  But, um, definitely  Uh, people backing the motorcyclists 
[01:07:30]  And people, other people backing the, uh, guy that was in the SUV  Um, yeah, two different stories  I was fortunate  I was telling Ann before the show  That I was walking around yesterday  And I was stuck at a light waiting  And, uh, there were two, uh, black guys  Important, I guess, for the discussion  Maybe not, I don't know  And I swear, I walked upon  And this is the first words I heard  I hear  You hear that motherfucker ran over that motorcycle guy?  Uh-huh  Like, he was all about that  That it was the driver's fault in the Range Rover 
[01:08:00]  And it got me to thinking  Because I am completely convinced  That that, the Asian guy  Was minding his own fucking business  Right  He's in a Range Rover with his wife  And a, and a small child  I mean, the odds are  He's minding his own business  He's not fucking around with a motorcycle gang  Yeah, at that point  But it's amazing how people perceive things  And I, and I, I almost, uh, decided to talk to those guys  To see if they knew more about it  But then I  Then I didn't bother, to be honest with you  But, but then it got me to thinking 
[01:08:30]  People just see things one way  And that is it  That's it  And mostly because, uh, you know  The, the helmet cam of these videos  Start with pretty much the Range Rover  You know, rolling over the motorcycle guy  They don't really have the, the initial bump  It shows the, uh, motorcycle slowing down  In front of the SUV and getting hit  Right  Um, and that started everybody initially surrounding the SUV  Right  Uh, before the big chase  Um, I don't know  Again, a lot of this goes down racial lines 
[01:09:00]  I mean, it's a, predominantly a black motorcycle gang  Um, and a lot of black people are supporting the motorcyclists  Of course  Based purely on race  I, I was watching a lot of the news shows last night  And, uh, in interviews and whatnot  You'll see the black guy up there  The talking head, uh, on Fox or CNN  And there they are  Defending the, uh, motorcyclists  Based purely on race  And bikers are defending them too  Yeah, yeah  Bikers are defending them too 
[01:09:30]  Yeah  Although you're not hearing from really, like, the, the hardcore, like, Harley guys  Like, I don't know  I think they realize they fucked up  But these guys are obviously  Just animals  Decided to go out there  And intimidate people  They were fucking around  You saw the other videos that were removed, right?  The one guy going in and out of traffic  Yeah  Against traffic  Yeah, they fucking  Oh, here's the video right here, yeah  That guy said, fuck that, I'm gonna go in the other lane  Yeah, he's in the other lane  They're, they're all about fucking around and intimidating people 
[01:10:00]  Yeah, I wonder who is more aggressive  Not to, not to the point where maybe someone's gonna get run over  But they certainly, certainly have some, uh, blame here  Is it the hundred guys in the bike gang?  Or the guy in the SUV with his wife and two-year-old?  Yeah, yeah  Gee, I wonder who is the aggressor  Like, how dumb  It's amazing that  Not according to these two guys that's on the street yesterday  They're like  Holy shit  Did you see that motherfucker running over the motorcycle guy?  They surrounded the guy  I had to, someone emailed me that  And I'm like, dude, they were, he was surrounded 
[01:10:30]  They were hitting his car and slashing his tires  He panicked and ran  Of course  What else are you gonna do?  You have, uh, the fight or flight instinct  And, uh, that wasn't a good fight opportunity  No  So you step on the gas  Regardless of who's in front of you  Gotta get the hell out of there  You gotta get the fuck out of there  But, uh, again  I guess there's a justice for, uh, hashtag  For the, uh, guy that, um  Well, the guy got fucked up pretty good  Paralyzed  He's pretty fucked up  You know what?  Maybe you don't block somebody's fucking SUV  Yeah  How about this? 
[01:11:00]  You don't surround somebody's SUV  When they're with their fucking wife  And two-year-old baby  And then wonder why they panic and drive away  That's the most primal of protection  Yes!  Protection instincts  You're ever gonna get  Is a man and his family  What the fuck did you expect him to do?  Step out of his vehicle  And, and talk reasonably  With people that are, uh, punching his vehicle  And trying to get inside  No, he's gonna step on the fucking gas  Run over  Think how desperate you gotta be  To run over motorcycles 
[01:11:30]  That are in front of you  With your wife and kid in the car  Nobody wants to do that  No!  It's fucking aggravating  And I know people, like  They hear half of the story, but  Yeah  Someone pointed out to me  You know when they stop the vehicle  And the guy takes his helmet  And it just smashes in the window  Uh-huh  And then, we've all seen the video by now  The second guy  Yeah  Rewatch that  He starts pounding on the passenger window  He's ready to break that window  And he stops out of nowhere  And actually they gave him a slap on the wrist  That, they, I think that guy came forward  Out  And they decide 
[01:12:00]  Just give him a little slap on the wrist  He's not in that much trouble  For the, for what he did  But he stops punching the window  And it was pointed out to me  That he might have saw the kid  In the, in the back seat  And went, oh, fuck  You know, we don't have a problem  With the fucking, you know, infant  Yeah  Or toddler  I don't know how old  How old was the kid?  Two, I think  Two, okay  Cause he, out of nowhere  He just stops  And kind of backs off  Like, whoa  This is too much for fucking me  I'm not breaking a window  Where there's a two-year-old in there  He was released  He wasn't charged  Yeah  What is that, the Van Wick? 
[01:12:30]  Yeah, that looks like it, right?  To JFK  It's got that  That's the, uh  Yeah, the tram to JFK  Yes  Well, we can't say tram anymore  Oh, no, I hit that  It was a whole chain reaction  I'm picking up my strawberries  I hit the bag  It hit the water  It fell over  And hit the tissues  Knocked into the other water  Hit the bell  I couldn't have done that  If I tried  Who doesn't enjoy  A good game of mousetrap?  Yes  Oh  Yuck  Remember that dumb game?  It seemed like a good idea 
[01:13:00]  It would set it all up  It would take forever  That's so stupid  And then what?  It fucking would go up  And it would never work  All the way through  It would hang up  Yeah  Well, that little thing  That had to go down the saw teeth  And go  Tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick  It never  It always stopped  I hit it  What napkins do I need?  Oh, boy, you're a slob  No, but there's trees being murdered  I don't mind the napkin  I like  I'm a good napkin guy  Yeah  But I don't need a stack  Trees being murdered  Got to protect the trees 
[01:13:30]  Absolutely  Feed the trees  There was a song called Feed the Trees  Was there?  I think it was Belly  So what are we waiting for here?  Jesus  Sorry, Robert  Dennis Denny Falcone is what we're waiting for  Didn't he know we needed him today?  I told him 15 minutes ago to be ready in 15 minutes  Oh, wow  But I'm saying he knew yesterday we needed him today, right?  Of course  So what's he doing?  Tim in New York  I think we've made this point  He goes  The guy started the video after the Range Rover got aggressive  Why aren't we talking about that? 
[01:14:00]  We are  But I think the news should talk about that a little more  Because that's where they pick up the story  Sure  They should explain a little bit that some shit happened before the video we're about to show you  But we don't have video of that  Does anybody wonder?  You're absolutely right, Tim  But we absolutely are talking about it  How come people don't wonder why the motorcycles are surrounding the Range Rover?  When does that happen under normal circumstances?  Yeah, yeah  When you can just run over a guy who's fucking bikes in front of you?  Well, I think with a gang of 100 or so motorcycles going down the road 
[01:14:30]  Anything you do in your vehicle is going to be dangerous to those bikers  So if this guy was changing lanes when they were all around him  Maybe a little erratic on his brake or something  I think the bikers could interpret that as him being an aggressor or an asshole  When in the meantime, if you think about it  The bikers are at fault by just being in that situation  And not riding legally too abreast, you know, in one lane 
[01:15:00]  They're supposed to ride like that  Right  How are they supposed to ride?  Too abreast  You know, they got these guys five across every lane  And then if the Range Rover decides to change a lane  As some guy speeding up next to him and cuts him off  Right  It's his fault?  No, you're driving like fucking assholes  Nothing is the other guy's fault at that point  You're forfeiting your ability to say that somebody else was fucking up 
[01:15:30]  Being the aggressor, cutting you off  Because your whole group is putting themselves in a situation to be put in danger  So, no, I can't see that guy  That fucking guy with his wife and kid  Doing anything that would put him in danger of an accident  Or in trouble with a hundred fucking motorcycle guys  Plus, another thing that people are ignoring  Even though Ray Kelly said it  Oh  The police commissioner  He said there was over 200 911 calls that day 
[01:16:00]  Yeah, yeah  Not over this incident  It wasn't 200 people that saw this shit going down  It was 200 other fucking things that people had a problem with  With these guys  They're fucking riding like assholes  And they deserve any fucking thing they get  They knew what they were doing that day  Exactly  They want to be aggressive, a little intimidating  And have a bit of fun  And then you get together on a highway  Over a hundred of you  You feel like you now own that fucking road  We all know exactly what went down 
[01:16:30]  A lot of them are unlicensed  Their bikes are unregistered  They're dirt bikes on the fucking road  Like, they're breaking the law by the numbers  I thought we had a cop  Oh, yeah  Whatever  You a cop?  We do have a lot of bike guys saying that they were in the wrong  Fucking narc  Me?  You a cop?  No  No  Maybe  What happened?  You what?  Fucking cop  And we're still 
[01:17:00]  Oh, no, Denny's outside the studio  Oh, Denny's ready  Oh, boy  He's ready?  Oh, boy  Hold on, we gotta do this thing  Over here first  Denny's foul cone  Hold on, man  There he is  I said hold on, man  Serious XM hat  I said hold on, man  Oh, boy  Just preparing  It's not a hot mic  It's not a hot mic yet  Cold  Cold mic  It's freezing  Wait for the big intro, please  It's Jocktober  A celebration of all things shitty in radio 
[01:17:30]  It's not very nice  It's not very nice  Fantastic failures of pontificating proportions  It's so bad  Wow  An interactive exploration of what makes radio rancid  Jocktober  O-M-T  Hosts  Holes  Bits  And Stunt Boys  This isn't funny  It's time for  Jocktober  I got a tree on my house  You know, we got more guys on the phones  I know we're moving on 
[01:18:00]  Dave goes  The bikers were blocking the highway  Which we've said many times  What are you supposed to do in that situation?  Assume that these guys are gonna do the right thing  As they block you on a highway?  Yeah, yeah  Or you're gonna go into major fucking panic mode  Panic  Nothing comes  Nothing good comes out of people blocking you on a highway like that  Good morning, Dennis  Jenny  Falcone  Good morning, good morning, good morning  Dennis, I guess  Is he part of our Jocktober today? 
[01:18:30]  Or our Jocktober today?  He's  That's a very good question  Yeah  Well, that remains to be seen  He's helping us out with Jocktober today  He wanted to be a part of Jocktober  He's the radio guy  Uh-huh  So we decided we'd throw him a bone  Oh  And let him share some of his stuff  Wow  Are there  Is there a show today that we will be featuring?  Or is it just Dennis?  It's  I brought in some radio history stuff  If this doesn't work out  Uh-huh  Oh, we have a backup plan? 
[01:19:00]  Oh, of course  Okay, good  I come equipped with a parachute  Nice  We are trying to mix it up a little bit  This Jocktober  Yeah, yeah, yeah  A little  Here's our attempt at mixing it up  By getting Dennis Falcone involved  And uh  What I did is I brought in a radio history  Yes, this is kind of the history of  What we call Jocktober  What are those things called?  Mini discs  Mini discs  Yeah  I remember the mini discs  Wow  Used to transfer a lot of  Wow, remember those?  Jingles and packages on here  I got stuff on DAT  DAT, yeah 
[01:19:30]  I need a DAT machine  I like that  We have DAT machines here  We have DAT machines here  Yeah, we have DAT machines here  No?  You want to check in on the DAT?  DAT one over there  No  DAT machine  And the mini disc was good  Mini discs came out around 1993  On fucking DATs  And you could erase them  And you could put  Move things around on there  And we used to put  Commercials on there  And jingles  And traffic reports  And contests  And how would you  How would you cue them?  They have a  It's like a CD  So you have a cut  Automatic cut  So I transferred a lot of my stuff 
[01:20:00]  From cassette and reel to reels  To these mini discs  Because that was the future?  Yeah  Mini disc, the future  I think it'll still take off  It still is in my room  It comes in the plastic  The square plastic case  And the disc goes in it  And you just pop the whole case  And everything into the machine  Yeah  I used to record my sets on those  Really?  I was the mini disc kid  I have a lot of those  These are great  I love these things  Yeah  Oh, we thought those  Were going to be the fucking thing  Well, the problem is  Then Sony came out  With a recordable CD  Shortly thereafter  They certainly did 
[01:20:30]  With a lot more capacity  Yeah  And it was easier  People already had CD players  And who thought  We'd come to a realm  Where there is no  Actual hard media  Sean Parker  Don't even need it anymore  Oh yeah  And for about five minutes  Napster  That's what  I mean  Napster  Everybody was like  Well, why just put it on my computer  It's like  Why do I need anything  That actually  Is a thing  When this exists digitally  We could just fucking  Throw it around  And now we're just in the clouds  It's in the cloud  They even call it the cloud  That's it 
[01:21:00]  Our shit is up there  It's up there in the clouds  Bunch of digital information  People very mad  That we didn't get your  You didn't get your  Walk on music today  Oh  Oh, W-O-L-D  Harry Chapin  Do you know if we  Had no electricity  A lot of history  Would disappear at this point  Who fucking  First of all  Who prints out  Their pictures anymore  No one takes pictures  And prints them out anymore  They're on your computer  You lose that  And it's just  Digital fucking  You see people  I can't find the  Photo mat anymore

[01:22:00]  Dennis  I'm going to teach you something  Learn how to breathe  This isn't a music radio  It does a little something  Let that impression  Breathe a little bit  A little bit  We got over four hours  To fill Dennis  Silence is a good thing  Silence is golden  That's all  I listen to the Ron and Fez show  Sometimes I think  The station goes off the air  Trying to figure out  If you're in a weak signal area  Yeah  Because they'll just  Stop talking  There'll be dead silence  And then you'll hear  Ronnie like  Wait a minute  So  What do you mean  They'll stop talking  Oh right  Ronnie looks at Fez 
[01:22:30]  To see if he's ready to talk  That's all that's about  There's no real talent there  He's actually just looking  To see if Fez is ready  Oh no  The answer is  Usually no  Usually no  But we all know  He's just trying to ban  All words  So it's brilliant  On his part  This isn't very good  What  What happened  Well since  Dennis Falcone  Is going to be  Featured on  Jocktober  Somebody just put  His Facebook address  Up on  Are you kidding me  Up on PalTalk

[01:27:30]  From the 60s and 70s  W-O-R-F-M  And the transition  Of how  And I wanna make it  Perfectly clear  My heard  Dennis thinks this is so good  That he has saved it  On a mini disc  It's perfect  Yeah  This is gold to him  For all eternity  W-O-R-F-M  At 139  With Bill Brown  In the big town  And presenting  One of the grooviest songs  To hit the musical scene  In a long, long time  If this sounds like  Your kind of radio  Join me  Brother John 
[01:28:00]  And we'll all be part  Of a new breed  Of people-to-people radio  Called love  Coming any day now  To WABC-FM  Stereo  W-A-B-C-F-M  New York's medium  With a message  You see, that became WPLJ  Before then, it was W-A-B-C-F-M  See, that depresses me  Because it reminds me  Of a time that's gone  Gone  Or it makes me feel like  I'm in a time that's gone  That stuff  I understand why you'd like it 
[01:28:30]  But it's  It's very nostalgic  Depressive  And yeah, yeah  It's a whole other time  Yeah, Danny is in  A Facebook group  Called  I'm a radio pro  Who still wants to use  My talents and skills  Profitably  Oh, that's the Dan O'Day site  Oh  The Dan O'Day site  Yeah  What's that about?  Dan is a broadcaster  A consultant  And he sells a lot  Of radio memorabilia  And how-to things  On how to write commercials  And I don't know  What all these are  And what's the  Sound booth guest roles? 
[01:29:00]  Check your mouth  It's a buddy booth  But Danny, what is this?  Where was this from?  What, the buddy booth?  Yeah  I have no idea  I'm just clicking away here  I don't know  The sound booth guest rules  It's on what  It looks like it's on the door  To a studio  Where you'd walk in  Shut your mouth  Do not touch anything  Check if engineer requires  Fresh beverage upon entry  Do not intercept any hot girls  That approach the booth  They're not here to talk to you  If you have any questions  Refer to rule number one  Which is shut your mouth  If you have any questions 
[01:29:30]  About rule number one  Refer to number seven  Which is then get out  So I guess it may be  Wow  That's very strict  A funny thing by an engineer  Have you been in a buddy booth before?  No, I've never been in a buddy booth  I've been in a jock booth  Oh  A bunch of jocks  What's the next track?  Did you ever go to radio camp?  What's that?  What are those radio camps  They have every year?  Oh, they have  Oh, that morning show boot camp?  Yeah  And I never went to that  Would you like to?  No, not really  We've been invited  For 20 straight years  You guys never went?  Nope  We are so not  We have an open invite  Like if those guys 
[01:30:00]  From the clips we just heard  Right  Like thought radio  Would turn into this  They probably would have  Just fucking left  Do you know how hated  You'd be at that thing?  Oh  How many of you have  Jocktober that are probably there?  Oh  We lived through it  The old school guys hating us  Yeah  Any W  They openly hated us  Hey  Here we are  What I put on here  Is basically what radio  Used to sound like  In the 60s  And into the 70s  Okay, what's the next track?  I believe it's  WABC-FM  The  Transitioned into  You know  The rock station 
[01:30:30]  From the 70s  Into the 80s  Now it's still 70s  No, from the still 60s  60s into the 70s  Wow  There's a lot of different cuts  On there from WOR-FM  Which then became  99X  98.7  And now it's a sports station  So it's  You know  Those were all music stations  Which was  Basically AM and FM back then  Are you on the New York  Radio message board?  No, I read those guys  But I don't  Post  But you do read?  Well, it's fun  I used to read  It's fun  I used to read that shit  It's fun  It's horrendous  One word  Their point of reference  Is 1973  You know 
[01:31:00]  The world ended back then  For that  Alright, so  This is another thing  Yeah, it's all just  Various clips from  You know  The past 20, 30 years  That I think  Yeah, that I think  You're going to love  There's no question  Mia Farrow  Kid is Frank Sinatra  Oh, that's Frank Sinatra  It's not Woody Allen  Stop it  Yeah, that's  That's becoming a bigger story  It looks like Frank and Mia  It looks exactly like  Him in the eyes, right?  Yeah, exactly  Yeah  And looks nothing like  Little fucking  No, of course not  Wormy Woody Allen  Woody's not going to have 
[01:31:30]  A good looking son  No  He's going to have  Like a troll looking son  Frank laid some pipe  Into Mia Farrow  And fucking had a kid  That big fucking  Sinatra hog  He made a come in  Come in  Come in, toots  I'm going to fuck you  That's what he did  You got to think  It's fucking thick  I'm shooting my goo  He fucking unloaded  Right in her  And she accepted it  Willingly  Good  Yeah  He probably came on her leg  And it just found its way in  Because this man's come  Or imagine Woody's a cuck  And he's sitting in a chair 
[01:32:00]  Somewhere jacking off  While Frank is just  Tooling Mia Farrow  Hey, take a look at this one, Woody  Yeah  And then Woody has to come over  And fucking  Nebbishly gobble up his cum  As it pours out of her anus  Take care of the bull  Take care of the bull  Yes  As soon as he dumped  He'd roll off  And light a ciggy  And say  Now get the kite  To clean it  Oh my god  I would have just said  Boy, they must have been  More than strangers in the night 
[01:32:30]  And then hit the record  Yeah  It would have been great  If you paused a little longer  Nice  Let the laugh  Just sit there  For a little bit longer  That's great  And then you pump it up  With that maybe  I love Denny  God  Alright, here's the  Give it a spin  Yeah, alright  So this is something  He insisted  It's all like just fun  Okay, alright  He's talking about  The cylinder of a gun  Right  Give it a spin  There's nothing  Wow  There's nothing fun about this  That's all what  Disc jockeys used to sound like  When it was good  It was good radio 
[01:33:00]  When it was good  Good radio  They were very good back then  I mean there's a skill to what they did  But they're irritating  But the point  Why save this shit  Oh, it's great  Wow  This is news from the Contemporary Radio Network  And I'm Bruce Brown in New York  This is WINS  All news all the time  And I'm Charles Edwards  56 degrees  And sunny at 5 o'clock  This is WNEW News  After the minute  Jim Donnelly reporting  It's 20 minutes before 6  This is Dan Thompson 
[01:33:30]  WORFM 2020 News  From all over the world  East, West, North and South  News from FM  From the American  That is all over  That's kind of cool  Wow  Everything had to sound  Very satellite-y  Right  And futuristic  Oh, we're getting this from a satellite  It sounded big  It sounded big  And people's ears would perk up  When they'd hear that sound  Or they'd know it's news  Yeah, I kind of like that  I understand the attraction  And their news, by the way  Was like so old  Like they would do the news 
[01:34:00]  About what happened  Like if it was world news  It was usually from the day before  And if it was national news  It was from way earlier in the day  Right  And even local  They didn't pick up on local stuff  Until maybe hours after  It's really amazing  You don't think they would have done  A Miley Cyrus twerking news story?  That's another thing  The fluff  There wasn't many fluff pieces  Not much  Back then  And they probably actually  Confirmed sources  Right, right  They wouldn't roll with a story  From some dude  That's just weird  From a tweet  Yeah, until a source was confirmed 
[01:34:30]  You never heard  According to Mongo the Trucker  Yeah, the UPI machines  Any of the AP machines  Yeah  The old tickers  Spitting out news  Yeah  And 1010 Winds still  Has the little ticker sound  In the background  Yeah  Actually the AP machine  I have to agree with Denny  Yeah  I was around long enough  To fucking see  And while the music was playing  You go to the AP machine  Because you would get  Fucking the freshest shit  Coming off 
[01:35:00]  Brandy new news  Way before anyone  Was broadcasting it  Because it went out  To everybody at the same time  Yep  And that's when you would learn  About some big celebrity  Dying or something  You're like  Holy fuck  I know before anybody  Is that how  I always wondered  How the news got around  I guess the AP machine  It was the AP machine  And that thing  Would just spit out shit  All day long  They had it in the background  Years ago  For real  At 1010 Winds  Yep  And then  When they stopped  People didn't like it  They were upset  At the quiet  With the newscast  To go  And so they recorded it 
[01:35:30]  And they just play it  On a loop now  It's just a sound effect  Under the broadcasters  Every single second  They're on the air  Oh wait  So did it used to be  That's where that came from  It was literally  Really in the background  Yeah  I worked out  A bunch of radio stations  There was always just  A room dedicated  To the AP machine  Because it would  Roll out paper  The whole room  Would fill up  He knows  Yeah  Would just fill up  And then it was your job  To fucking  Throw some of it away  And you know how mad  The morning news guy  Would come in  If the overnight guy  Didn't replace the ribbon  And he came in  And all 
[01:36:00]  You know how like  It would just be so  Oh too light  You can't see it  Yeah  They must have gone  Through a lot of ink  On those things  Oh yeah  One of my fucking jobs  Way back in the day  Was I had to like  When I was doing overnights  I had to rip up the AP copy  And save the good shit  And highlight it  And leave it for the morning guy  You remember this  Yeah sure yeah  You had to do all that  Cut it up  You know keep it there  No rip and read  Make sure you rewrite your stories  You don't want to rip and read  Right off of the AP wire  Rewrite it yourself  You rewrite it and what  Throw in like  Some of your own little spin 
[01:36:30]  Well because a lot of it  Was written very very formal  And you try to make it  More conversation  But everyone rips  And read  Yeah  Everybody  Uh huh  You didn't have time  To fucking rewrite your stories  Don't rip and read  Oh I like that  Right  Alright what are we going to hear now  I do that on the  Shitter  They said  On the set of the Brady Bunch  Rip and read  Rip it  What are you doing  Rip and read  That's what the well hung  Guest star said  He fucked his tiny

Herb God bless him  He's got to be in his early 80s  But he's still going strong  Still doing cruise ships  Does he sing that song?  He sings  Yeah  He actually had a bunch  Of different songs  You know  What year was that  That that happened?  That's the fucking  It sounds Christmasy  The funny thing is  It was New Year's Day  He was the morning man 
[01:42:00]  He was working on New Year's Day  Wow  That's crazy  What an asshole  Yeah  No one else  No one was listening  No one  Back then  Morning men  And even afternoon guys  They worked six days  They worked Saturday morning as well  We did too  When we started at A.F.  Yep  Now he mentioned something on there  He said Roby Young starts at midnight  Roby Young was the disc jockey on WABC  Who mentioned that  Remember the thing about Paul McCartney being dead?  Yes  Well he mentioned that  What?  And the phones went crazy  And Rick Sklar  The program director  Was called at home at 3 o'clock in the morning 
[01:42:30]  And security removed him from the studio  Removed that disc jockey  Roby Young  And I had that  Why'd they remove him?  Because he said that Paul McCartney was dead  You can't just say things like that on the radio back then  You can't say Mayer's dead either  You know  Did he say he was dead or there was a rumor circulating?  I believe he said that Paul is dead  So the rumor is speculating  I have the clip  Oh wow  Let's hear this  Cool  Now we're getting into some cool shit  Nice  Wednesday time now  7pm  Time for the Big M  Bruce Morrow  Tonight from Ravenhall Pool  At Coney Island

[01:52:30]  Oy vey  He would say boobie on the air  They were very very folksy  He would say boobie on the air  Like talking about tits  And  Chip it can't take here  And boobie  And Jack's  Jack's sign off  Would be  Watch out streets  Here I come  Watch out street  Here I come  Oh  He's gone out on the streets  That would be  1965  64  Oh man  That we were just hearing  Yeah  Because then  Harry Harrison  Went to WABC  To be the morning man  He replaced  Herb Oscar Anderson  The guy who used to sing  Is he dead  Harry Harrison  No  No  Living  That's too bad  And is in Jersey 
[01:53:00]  He's a wonderful man  Very nice man  Very nice man  Do you go over there  And just talk radio  As you jerk each other off  Oh wow  Very nice man  That's a little much  Very nice man  That's how a lot of the old radio guys  Don't want to talk to Denny  If he starts tugging their pricks  They'll tell him stories  No he would always say that  You have to be clean  When you're on the radio  Because if the kids are in the car  Or in the kitchen  And say  What does he mean by that mom  Show him  I'm sure  I mean pretty soon  Your son is listening to the radio 
[01:53:30]  Yeah  Right  Is he listening to dad's  Shout out in the morning  Would he not care for our show  You think of that guy  Oh boy  What do you listen  Let him listen to radio Disney  Well he did say yesterday  Dad you can't say fucking  To me  So  Wow  He wasn't listening to the radio show  He was just listening to  Oh  To dad  Yeah we're up to the point  Where we realize  We can't curse anymore  Right  He goes  You can't say fucking  He just says it  And I go  Well you can't either  He goes  But you said it  I said I know  That was a mistake 
[01:54:00]  Then you gotta make a deal  And say okay  I won't if you don't  Right  And you can't either  So next time I make a mistake  And you have to point it out  You little fucker  I said  You know  Say daddy  You can't say that word  Yeah  See  I'm a good father  That word  I just do it a little differently  Yeah  Let's spin a hit there  Oh  What happens  Spin a hit  Oh sure  Okay  I hope you're enjoying your coffee  It's all gone  How many tracks did you bring us  He has no clue  Ten  Ten tracks  I'm quite enjoying these  I like it  Yeah 
[01:54:30]  I like it too  I like knowing about these guys  It's a little radio history  I don't understand why these guys become famous though  That's all  And I know it's from another time  So I'm not even trying to be a dick  It's the only thing you had also  You had radio  Yeah  You had TV  And that was it  You didn't have the internet  But why were the good guys famous?  They brought everything to you  They made it sound so  We got the Beatles  We've got the Dave Clark Five  There was a mystique behind these guys too  You never saw them  It was the big familiar voice every day  Would come on  And the way they're talking  They're very knowledgeable  They got a very strong voice 
[01:55:00]  But weren't there another bunch of guys  Maybe they were the okay guys or something  Yeah but you don't want to listen to them  Why weren't they famous  Maybe another group  Another group of people were listening  They just fucking hit  Yeah  Those guys  By the way  And he downplays it  He really knows his radio history  I love these old really known guys  That used to do  I listened to it growing up all the time  But mine was you know  I listened in my parents' car  Over there arguing  I could kind of hear the radio  Every so often  Between dad yelling at my mom 
[01:55:30]  That she's raising a queer son  Because he's playing with dolls  Dad was smart  I do have a respect for these guys  That came before us  I just  It's hard to understand it sometimes  That's all  But I guess you gotta wrap your head around  That it was a different time  Oh yeah  Did you have respect for them  When you came to NEW?  I would've  But they were such fucking pricks to us  We're like okay  Alright  So now we know what we're in for  Was Pat St. John okay to us? 
[01:56:00]  I think he warmed up to us after a while  You know what  To be fair  He was  I like Pat  He was alright too  Yeah  I still hear him on SiriusXL  Do you like Pat?  Oh yeah Pat's a great guy  Yeah I like Pat  He's got  He's the stuff boy  You know you're right  Pat was alright to us  He was a good guy  He's alright  He's here now  Yeah yeah  We had him on the show once  Uh huh  No he was alright  I see him walking around sometimes  Yeah  That's pretty much it  That was it  I'll be honest  Some of the folks are getting restless  For some jocktober  Yeah  I'm gonna start ripping people apart 
[01:56:30]  Yeah  Well maybe we do another jocktober  I don't like  I like this little radio history  I kind of like it  Well we're alone  It's gonna stop  Oh really?  Really?  Time to turn off the Twitter for a while  Yeah  Well they're not killing us  Really?  You guys promised  Well I think they want to hear  Some of the jocktobers  And I understand  I want to hear Dennis' comedy bit  As much as I'm enjoying this  I will get that  This isn't a jocktober  No it's not a jocktober  Well it  I want to hear Paul is dead  It's a month of  You know  Just kind of 
[01:57:00]  Looking into radio  So I don't mind this  But if you're used to us  Just ripping the shit out  Of a radio show  Yeah relax  We got fucking  We have plenty of them  Plenty of time  It's only jocktober 3rd  Yeah  What do you want  Another fugitive bit?  Do you have a disc  Standing by?  Of course  Oh so we might  Maybe we'll just do another one  Before Meghan McCain  Sure go ahead  But first this  It's the 6th annual  WABC  Principal of the year  Election  Okay here we go everybody 
[01:57:30]  We've got 4 minutes now  Past 12 o'clock noon  On a Friday bomb dating show  This is WABC's  Solid gold summer spectacular  In progress all summer long  And this is the 20th anniversary  Of the bombing of Hiroshima  I understand  So in view of that  His last break on WABC  He got fired for that?  Right after that  He got fired for that?  Bob Dayton  Yeah  Playing happy birthday  On the anniversary 
[01:58:00]  Of loving at Hiroshima  That's a great  That was a fucking great  See I think that's where  We made our mistake today  You should have brought  Like some of that edgy shit  From the old guys  The original edgy  The original edgy  Because that  Far and few between  I understand how crazy  That would be  For that fucking radio station  That was his last break?  Yep  20 years later  They weren't still  You know  Eh fucking jams  No?  Nope  Why were they mad  At him for that though?  I guess  Goodbye  Did he know  He was on his way out  Or he didn't 
[01:58:30]  Bob was an interesting guy  Worked with Bob  At a radio station  Bob who again?  Bob Dayton  And then he kind of  Floated back  Who's he fucking  Going out with?  No it's probably  Spelled D-A-Y-T-O-N  Yeah  He fell on some hard times  Why?  He worked at WCBS FM  And then he  I believe he got fired there  And then he ended up  Back on Long Island  So you go  Is he living?  No he passed away  I'd love to ask him about that  Yeah he had some  He used to live in  The record library  At the radio station  At one time  So he didn't know  That that was gonna  Get him fired?  Guess not  I guess he thought  He was doing some content 
[01:59:00]  That's uh  Wow  Hey that's his fucking  Church  That sounded really weird  That's his fucking  Mayor Menino  Cause you knew those  Radio stations like that  Would never fucking  Take chances like that  He's a shock jock  Happy birthday  So he's like  Oh the 20th anniversary  I'll play happy birthday  And I'll fucking wish them  That's 63  Uh yeah  Bombing Hiroshima was  No if it was 20 years ago  It was 45  Oh 45  Yeah 45  That's unheard of  For 1963  1665  Wow  65  I didn't think 
[01:59:30]  They were that  Politically correct  In 65  To give a shit  If you  Cause I mean  Back then  As I even know  As a kid  In the 70's  You'd say  Oh that's just  Japanese junk  Oh it's made in Japan  Oh Japs  Like people are still  Saying that shit  Not on the radio  Or TV  Not on radio  Or TV  Nah  People wouldn't  Talk like that  About Hogan's heroes  Nazis  Would they say Krauts  They'd say Krauts  Sure 
[02:00:00]  They kept it fun  Cause the laugh track  Made it all up  It really did  Big bright swastikas  On a comedy  But there was  He was a good  Disc jockey too  Bob  Well apparently  Not very  Fucking thoughtful  They're not liking this  Jimmy  They're Japanese  I gotta be honest  They're not liking this  It's old stuff  It's old stuff  Maybe we can eat  On the air  To get him to  Yeah the guy gets  Food and some old stuff  Well very good news  Tomorrow  This would be  A perfect time  To announce  It's taco day  Taco day tomorrow  So please tune in  As we eat tacos 
[02:00:30]  On the air  You're gonna love it  Believe me  I don't want to talk  About close minded  Holy fuck  Had no idea  Until Jimmy  Brought everyone's  Attention  That  They don't enjoy  The fact that  We're enjoying food  They hate it  What's this track  Dennis  What cut you up to  He has no idea  What track it is  He was making coffee  Instead of paying attention  To your list  He's not a professional  A element of surprise  For you  I'm up to cut  This should end  20 minutes ago  Should we be on cut 9  Which cut is that 
[02:01:00]  12 and a half minutes  Before 1 o'clock  On WABC  Robby Young here in New York  With all night music power  The Beatle Paul may be dead  Les Marshack here  And you know  We've been getting  Some phone calls  The switchboard downstairs  Has been inundated  Regarding some speculating  That Robby Young  Was doing earlier this morning  Regarding Paul McCartney  If you were listening  You're aware of it  But please be assured  That those speculations  Are untrue  They are untrue  Please don't call  Alright  Wait what happened  Oh boy  Which guy got fired  The guy who said  Paul may be dead  He goes 
[02:01:30]  Paul McCartney may be dead  I didn't have everything  That went after that  Unfortunately  Why now  Okay I'll explain  He went into the record  And when he went into the record  I guess the switchboard  Went crazy  Because he said  Paul may be dead  So that was his tease  And then he's going to  Play some music  And then he's going to  Talk about it further  Don't mention anything  About Paul being dead  The program director  Might have said  Look there's this stuff  Don't mention it  He went in there  And he said  Paul may be dead  Phones went crazy  Rick Sklar calls up  The disc jockey  Les Marshak  And they said  Get in here  And Les did the rest 
[02:02:00]  Of the show  Wow  Fired  The phones were just  Going crazy  Did they fire him?  I believe security  Had him  Rick went into the station  And they had him removed  Especially  But that was a huge rumor  He didn't start the rumor  No but don't talk about it  We know how to start a rumor  Don't talk about it  This guy was just  Talking about a rumor  Don't  They  You know  The message was  He didn't want the switchboards  Being inundated  Don't say that  WABC  Which is WA Beetle C  Said Paul may be dead  WA Beetle C  You can't say that  WA Beetle C  Okay I understand 
[02:02:30]  I didn't want him saying that  Sure  Yeah yeah yeah  And that was it  The last track was  A disc jockey  By the name of  Mad Daddy  And he was just  Reverb  I ain't mad  I'm just frustrated  I mean this guy is just  I'm all full  Entertainment all the way  He's crazy  Like a plump hot dog  I ain't mad  I just gotta have the hot dog juice drained out  Okay  Then I'll be sleepy daddy  One time I fell asleep with a ciggy in my mouth 
[02:03:00]  Oh  I had  Cummy all over my belly and my boxes  Cummy  And there I was  Hurt my back being all  Asleep with a ciggy  Crumped over the crib  It's just  There's just  No reason for it  Oh god  Here's Mad Daddy or something like that  Mad Daddy yeah  Alright  Uh oh  From the little radio station

[02:05:00]  Oh that's too bad  Oh Denny  I want to hear some of the comedy bits  On Denny's thinking  I think that we can make fun of that  Oh I would like to hear some comedy  Yeah I think you might have  It would have been good  If you picked like better clips  Some comedy  Like more scandalous clips  They don't have any of those  More like Scott Muni  Talking to the Beatles  For the first time  Oh  Well I'll see what I can get  From my radio cohorts  Cohorts  What do you have  In the Jocktober wise  We're just  Who me  Yeah anybody  Well I got a show  I mean  Oh  I got a full on  Alright let's do that 
[02:05:30]  But you see what you guys did  Is you guys kind of enjoyed that  And you honored those gentlemen  I did enjoy that  But Rob is right  Richard  And so much  They all enjoyed it  But now they're listening  To the listener feedback  And they're trying to  Well the bottom line is  I did enjoy it  But it's not technically  A Jocktober bit  So I understand  I kind of enjoyed it  I enjoyed it selfishly  Yes exactly  Ah selfishly  Selfishly I enjoyed it  But not thinking  That maybe the listeners  Were enjoying it as well  Richard Cranium  Of course you know  That's dickhead  Sure  He says  Sorry but I've had enough 
[02:06:00]  Of this no payoff  Denny bullshit  They're turning on me  They certainly are  Well they should be  That only means  You should go back  Into your cubicle  That's almost out  Of the building  Near the supply closet  You know why  They moved him  Get back in there  And fucking prove  These people wrong  Yeah daddy  Get some comedy  On that thing  You go down  That fucking hall  With a little energy  And you prove  These assholes wrong  When you walk  I want you to hear  This in your head  That's right

[02:11:30]  Still on fire  It's hilarious  Huh  Wait sir  Is your vehicle  Wait I think  I gotta defend  I gotta defend  Wasn't she laughing  Cause she heard  Somebody else laughing  In the background  I heard some shit  In the background  Right  They were laughing  Were they laughing at him  And his fiery girlfriend  No  What  They weren't  They were laughing  At something in the background  They were laughing  At something in the background  The operator heard that  So she kinda just  Is that her excuse  Yes  Okay  That's what I thought too  Plausible deniability  Okay

[02:12:30]  I would be too  But they call this  An isolated incident  We're investigating  What the laughter  Was about  They started investigating  Before the complaint  Ever came in  And say  Despite the call takers  Poor performance  Response time  Wasn't affected  Ah god  She's fired  That's pretty funny  Fat Matt says  His girlfriend  Sounds hot  Cause she's on fire  They're gonna fire  The operator  We shouldn't  Be laughing though  They're gonna fire her  Definitely  Fired  How ironic  But the operator  Knew right away  Cause it's kind of her job 
[02:13:00]  That it wasn't  A serious situation anymore  And she heard  Actual laughter  In the background  Yeah she does  I agree  And she immediately  Why can't you just say that  I wasn't referring to that  Right right  Don't worry about it  It didn't sound like  She was coming up  With an excuse  You know  Someone else is on fire  If I was laughing  Yeah  It's too bad  What about the  Little wiener thing  What's that  Yeah we'll do  The little wiener thing  And then  What is that  This has the  Internet abuzz  Yeah this is the big  Viral clip  Viral for the next  Ten minutes  Oh yeah  Vests and stuff

[02:14:00]  Petted  When he's not  Sinking his teeth  And claws into your arm  He loves being petted  See he goes crazy  Then he falls asleep  Then he wakes up  And goes crazy  Then he falls asleep  That's pretty much  The life cycle  Of little Beavis  At this point  I walk into the kitchen  He'll bite my ankles  Oh  He climbs up my pant leg  When I stop  And then  If I'm sitting on the couch  He will come out of nowhere  Bounce straight up in the air 
[02:14:30]  And come straight down  And whatever he lands on  He will sink his teeth into  That's gonna be real fun  When he gets older  He's gonna get bigger  And what'll be great  Is he'll weigh more  So as he's climbing up your leg  Your pants will rip  Right  Because it's more weight  Yep  On that  I've got plenty of shirts  With holes in them  Because little  Bruiser Brody  Thought it'd be fun  To jump up on my back  And then try to climb down  Oh  And then panic  And claw my back  Yeah  In my shirt  Oh 
[02:15:00]  I see  Ant's raising the kitten properly  Is he?  Oh yeah  Absolutely  I don't think we'll hear  Any horror stories  Down the road  How long do you think  Before Beavis is no longer  Welcome in the compound?  Christmas  Oh no  You get it till Christmas  Yeah  Cause he's gonna make it really hurt  He's gonna go up in the tree  He's gonna be annoyed with Beavis  And then it's Christmas as well  So he's like  Yeah this is a perfect time  To cut him loose  No no no  I won't cut him loose  He's for so much fun  But he'll have  But he'll have his own room eventually 
[02:15:30]  No  That he will not be allowed to leave  Oh no  Once he's full of size  He won't last  Right  You never  No way  No fucking way  No fucking way  Alright can we see this clip?

And I have a disc  I'm gonna make an executive  I've cut up some of his  He's wearing his headphones  I'm gonna make an executive  You walk around wearing your headphones?  Like a doctor with a stethoscope  Huh? 
[02:16:00]  I was just using them  Alright so you leave them where you were using them  It's not like you have to hook them up to your head  I think people believe that you actually do radio stuff here  You don't have to like  Oh  Walk around with the  Hold on  Now you got a hot mic  Okay hot mic  I was using them  So I could listen to the CD  To make sure the transfer worked properly  Oh good  I'm not gonna lose them  It says Falcone on the side of them  This is from your mini disc  Yeah that's when I used to do a thing on my Friday show called Friday Night Fun  And I would play the comedy bits 
[02:16:30]  A little ham handed  It's Friday night and it's fun  You'd play a bit, hit a jingle, and back into a song  It's Friday Night Fun  Really?  Alright  It was just professionals  I do have a cue sheet  So it's just quick clips from  Professional comedians  I kind of did this in between records a little bit too  Okay  I have to confess  You and me  We're the same  You moved on from it  Yeah  We sort of started in the same place  And then I realized it was all bullshit  And I decided to become a multi-millionaire  Oh boy  Denny embraced it  And you embraced it 
[02:17:00]  Instead of collecting paychecks  Denny decided to collect air checks  Oh damn  Nice  Yeah  You and I should work together  Sam  Denny and Sam  The in-between man  Sam and Denny  I'd probably go same to Denny  Stop believing  Stop believing in it  Don't stop believing  Hit music from Journey  God damn it  He never stops  He never stops  You're telling him to change his life  And he's got to  I'm trying  He's got to pretend he's introing a song  Right 
[02:17:30]  That's great  That's not going to pay the bills  Just a sad man  You don't want to be a mobile disc jockey  I know you don't  I do enjoy it  But  You wish you didn't have to do it  Did that party at Steve Puma's house  We had a good time  But if you're getting a  Steve Puma  But if you were getting a great salary  You would  You would fucking blow that off immediately  No I love  You would throw that hard drive of hits  Into the Hudson River  You have a hard drive of hits  Fuck no  You referenced it  I heard you mention that last week  You said  Oh I got this song on my hard drive of hits  So you're using some of the vernacular 
[02:18:00]  Your phone is like your hard drive of hits  Yeah  It was just a joke  Yeah  Everybody's saying vernacular now  It's really catching up  Yeah yeah  It's becoming part of the vernacular  Well  Yeah I got made fun of for it  If you're just tuning in  Denny came in for Jocktober today  And he was a huge bust  Yeah it was  Well we're going to come back strong tomorrow  With Taco Day  So don't you worry  Yeah don't worry  You can hear us eat  And by the way  Jocktober will not be putting anybody else's hands tomorrow  Oh man  No no no no no no  Hold on hold on a second  Let me get the street  Yes  I just brought a little radio history 
[02:18:30]  I don't have any air checks  Making fun of disc jockeys  All the stuff I have  Are radio profits  It was interesting  Selfishly I guess  Yeah  And we're going to try to do an actual Jocktober  But you had this mini desk of comedy  And we decided we needed to hear this  Yeah it was comedians  Let's hear it  Oh my god  They're 50 seconds each  We're not doing this  It'll be fun though  No because it's just a bit from a comic  Hard drives of ha ha's  It is a bit  What?  You have a bit  How long is your bit? 
[02:19:00]  Not 13 seconds  10 seconds  We can't do this  Look it's all  We know what this is  We go through one  We could spare 50 seconds  No Carlin  It's just regular comics  That's all it is  It's just regular  That's all it is  Okay yeah  I thought you had like goofy parodies  Like disco duck type shit  No  Dickie Goodman type shit  No  We did that last week  No this is going to be good quality clips from comics  That's what it is  From comics  Friday night fun  Wait you do have an all in the family clip here  Let me go to that  Anna like this one  Oh okay  Read it  Do you know what you're stuffing them envelopes with? 
[02:19:30]  No I didn't read it  Well you're stuffing them envelopes with radical liberal garbage  Why don't you stop putting labels on things you don't understand?  Well I understand this all right  Queen's Free Clinic  A place for the high school dropout  The teenage runaway  That will provide free food  Free medical attention  Free treatment for VD  VD  Do you know what that means here?  VD  Now wait don't tell me  I know it's someone's initial

[02:20:30]  Sly and the family stone  In the family  You know  Maybe you'd play the all in the family theme song  Oh  Or you'd play the council family  Partridge family  Ah  Because it's all in the family  Not the Manson family  It might have been  You know what?  That might have been a theme  Might have been a theme  Family thing  Family night  It's family night  You can play the Everly brothers  Right  You know people who are brothers in groups  Sister Sledge  Sister Sledge  Right  Mamas and the Papas  See now you're on a roll  There you go  I like that

He used to do a radio show too  Not a huge fan  I never thought he was very funny  No  Well I tried  I just wanted to bring a little something  Denny  No one is going to fault you for trying  No  You know  It's just  It didn't 
[02:23:00]  Didn't quite get traction  As they say  It's Jocktober  A celebration of all things shitty in radio  That's not very nice  That's not very nice  Fantastic failures of pontificating proportions  That's so bad  Wow  An interactive exploration of what makes radio rancid  Jocktober  Jocktober  O-M-T  Hosts  Holes  Bits  And stunt boys  This isn't funny  It's time for  Jocktober 
[02:23:30]  Yes  I got a tree on my house  Alright  I got a tree on my house  Alright  Now we are going to get into  The real Jocktober  The true spirit of Jocktober  Fudge yeah  I thought for a second  That I could ease up on the controls  And kind of spread the Jock  I'm stuck with this  Yeah  Denny should have been like an add on  Like  We're doing Jocktober  So a little history  Before we actually do 
[02:24:00]  The Jocktober part  But  It's like we tried to make a full meal  Out of little appetizers  Yeah  And the appetizer is shit  Yeah  Here we go  Jocktober  We're going to  Where  Oh my god  We need a wheel  We need a wheel or something  Right Denny  Denny  A wheel  Sound effect  Where are we going on the big globe  Here it is  Spin the wheel  And then we land on a fucking city  What city are we going to today  Sam Roberts

[02:25:00]  We were very pleasant with the man  Yeah  Because he's full of shit  Kind of likes us too  Kind of likes our show  Yeah but he's an asshole  So we should like air it out with him  I don't think so  What is this?  Wow  Well we're going to Flint, Michigan  The show is on CK 105  That's right  CK 105  And we're talking about a  You know  A husband and wife team sort of thing 
[02:25:30]  They're not really married  Even though they're not really married  Like a radio husband and wife  But they act like it  On the air  Because you know  There's that banter  There's the  She's keeping him in check  He's like  Alright  Well  What am I going to do?  I just got depressed for these guys  And I don't even know them  Shitty radio in a shitty city  That is a shitty city  That's a shitty city right now  Yeah  I know a lot of the  A lot of the boys are  You know  Hanging in there  But  How do you talk up the people of Flint, Michigan  Oh my god  To get them in a good mood

[02:27:00]  Oh really?  Yes  They're selling like jewelry maybe  Oh yeah  Knives  She loves ordering from QVC  She just talks about QVC for a paragraph  If she would show off one of the sweater meat  I won 125 auctions  Oh  Have you seen that fucking pig?  Yes  That poor  A poor guy that we would have to come home to that lump of shit  And I won this  Oh  What kind of music do they do on Mike and Stephanie? 
[02:27:30]  Opie  I'm glad you asked  Thank you  All the hits  All of them?  Oh  They don't leave out any of the hits  Not one  Every single hit  Except all is not underlined  Hits is  So it's all the hits  All the hits  So  They play the best of Jake LaMotta  His wife  Could he beat her?  Why  Why wouldn't you underline all?  It's like we play all the hits  All the hits  You don't go we play all the hits  Right  Just call it hit music 
[02:28:00]  Be done with this  Top of the muffin to you  We play all the hits  Why would they put pictures like that  Up on their Facebook page?  Oh  Oh  Is it blonde sucking a big black dick  Mommy and Lamar?  I don't know  Wow they're edgy up there  In Michigan  Must have been a promotion  When I wasn't listening  I don't know for sure  That's really crazy  Because we certainly did not give out  The Facebook page  CK 105 in Flint, Michigan  Mike and Stephanie in the morning  Let's get right into this 
[02:28:30]  Please  Did you read the bios?  Yes  Because the bio banter  Is usually pretty good  If you're seeing anything else  That catches your eye  Please let us know  What is his story?  Yeah what's my  Yeah  Mike he likes  He likes Kanye West  Goo Goo Dolls  Black Eyed Peas  That guy does not like Kanye West  I like a little Kanye  But this is  This is the important thing  If you weren't working on the radio  What would you be doing?  Yeah  He says he'd be the role of Carlos  On Desperate Housewives 
[02:29:00]  It would be me and Ava baby  That's terrific  That's terrific  He looks pretty nerdy  Yeah  Yeah  But he's listening up a little bit  You see that  He has kind of a Harry Anderson look to him  A few buttons undone  He's not going with the white undershirt  It's a little yellow  No  But he's got like a blazer on over it  Well  He stays professional  But knows how to have a little fun  Am I right Denny?  Yeah  Right Denny  God can't like you if he makes you do radio in Flint, Michigan 
[02:29:30]  Flint, Michigan  Okay  You did something wrong in a past life  Now I saw a third guy  That is  Who is it?  Chachi  Ah  He's a producer  Another Chachi in radio  He's a producer  How many Chachis have we worked with?  At least two I think  Hey Chachi  You can blame God  For putting Mike and Stephanie  In Flint all you want  But they are doing nothing  To get themselves out of this market  Oh  Oh really? 
[02:30:00]  Nothing  I want to hear a little bit of them  Yeah  Well let's do it then  Let's get to it  So they're coming out of Bruno Mars  And this is just  You know Bruno Mars has a big song called Gorillas  And it's about having intercourse  With  Like gorillas  Oh  That's right  Oh  And this is just an example of Mike and Stephanie  Going off the cuff  Mike  Uh huh  Just kind of  Whatever pops into their heads  All the hits  CK 105.5  Bruno Mars  Talking gorilla sex 
[02:30:30]  And you know here's the thing  Female gorillas  Oh  Use sex as a tactic  To thwart their rivals  What?  Yeah  Yeah but believe it or not  Gorillas made for life  So it's the gorilla of your dreams?  I knew you were going there  I couldn't help it  It was appealing  I couldn't help it  This is just  This doesn't  Oh my god  It's so hard to believe this is real shit  It's real dude 
[02:31:00]  It's real  It's so hard to believe  This is actually real shit  She stumbles over her line anyway  It's the gorilla of your dreams  Yeah  The gorilla  And then she's laughing like it was the line of the fucking month  Right  And he's giving it to her too  And he's fucking selling it for her  Denny what did you think of that content though?  He went out of the gorilla song  And then he talked a little bit about  You know what gorillas do  And sex  Yeah  Do you think that was good that he tied it  A little blue  A little blue  Tied it together?  What's your favorite sex song?  Oh  What's that?  I want your sex 
[02:31:30]  George Michael  Oh  That's cool  I'm too sexy  Now you tell me  As you listen  I mean it's enough of that  But you tell me  Yeah  Your sex songs are queer  Sexy eyes  Dr. Hook on the medicine show  Sexy eyes  Oh god  What about sexual healing?  Marvin you were saying  You were carrying on  I was getting to that one  I was just three  I was four  Four in a row  Way to go  Stop it  You would swear that was like an SNL bit or something  It was just amazing  It's so utterly bad  You tell me as you're listening to these clips 
[02:32:00]  If you think Mike likes to infuse a fun fact in his radio show  Oh  He likes to  He likes  That's his thing  I bet  That's his thing  You heard him come out of the Gorillaz song  And he said  You know  Gorillaz  They mate for life  Right  Right  So he'll look at a song  And be like  How could I tie something fun fact into that song?  Or  And this is  From my experience of working with some of the great radio personalities  Thank you Sam  Oh  Sometimes  Awkward  Very awkward 
[02:32:30]  Sometimes a fun fact is found  Uh huh  And the jock then goes out of his way  To find a song  Or a talking point  Or just  Or nothing  Nothing  If you think of the way Scorch used to do it  For instance  Me  The anniversary of the jungle gym  Right  To squeeze in a top ten people named gym list  Right  Wow  Happened  That was a Scorch  Not on the anniversary of the jungle gym  That was the made up part  It doesn't matter 
[02:33:00]  People won't know  But more importantly  Did he find his fax machine?  He never gave us an update on the fax machine  I know  I'm waiting for a fax to find out  Back to Mike and Stephanie  In the morning  CK 105 in Flint, Michigan  Before we get to birthdays  I want to give this woman a shot  Because both of us were idiots  You made a note yesterday  I did  I took a note  This woman called  She said her daughter was having her 17th birthday  Yesterday  Yes  But she was going to be in school  And she was already at school  And we said we'll do it for you tomorrow at 6.40  With the birthday badge  Because that would be great  Well 
[02:33:30]  It's been the process  That piece of paper we took notes on  Has been thrown away  So we don't remember the name  We remember she was 17 yesterday  So you know who you are  Give us a call right now  So we can get your daughter's name on the air  And make it snappy, Mom  So  Isn't this right?  There's always something  Oh, we got to get to the 9.40 birthday  But like  What?  They just  Exactly  Everything's a thing and a gimmick  They're not like  Oh, could you wish a happy birthday to my daughter tomorrow?  Oh, yeah, sure  Oh, we lost the paper  Anyway, moving on 
[02:34:00]  Oh, man, you would never even deal with it  Right, right  Instead, they're like  They have to take 50 seconds  Or however long that is  God, it's  Give us a call  Oh, my God  And she just sounds like  That whole voice she's got  Fuck, yeah  I can't believe  Oh  Danny, can we just punch you?  Oh  You are representing this  You're representing this shit  No, I don't like that kind of radio  Technically  I mean, it's very contrived  And, you know  You notice I have a little more energy?  Because I heard the old school guys  Yeah  Is that what did it?  Yeah, it made me a little  Yeah, a little energetic  Gave me a little energy today 
[02:34:30]  A little zip in your step  I'll say  Here, if I could be racist again  Um, well, time for the birthday list  Yeah, we're not done with birthdays  Oh, sorry  Fuck  No, it's okay  I was just reiterating  Time for the birthday list  We have to keep going  You know, because they did that birthday stuff  Uh-huh  See, birthdays on the radio are stupid  We kind of like  We kind of like  Point out a couple of celebrity things  Because it hopefully leads to  Content  Content  And maybe a few lofts  Is what we're hoping for  Fun  Right  That's the one thing Scorch did well  We try 
[02:35:00]  I don't know  That always made me laugh  What?  When I was working for Scorch up in Syracuse  People would call and say  Hey, could you wish me happy birthday?  And every time he'd go  No, we don't do that  And they'd go  Can you just say like happy birthday to so-and-so?  And every time  No, absolutely not  No  We don't do that  It's great  Good for you, Scorch  It was dead set against it  People like to hear their name on the radio  They do  Thanks for the insight  I used to just make up names  Just to get a name out there, right?  Well, we had a playlist  And then you made believe 
[02:35:30]  Every song was requested by somebody  Nice  Hey, I'm gonna just  Hey, I'd like to say  Say hi to Anthony Cumia out there  Anthony Cumia from Long Island  Whoa  I could do it now  That's fine  All by myself  I just  My name just went out on the radio  Listen to the replay  That would have excited me so much as a kid  Usually it's over the police scanner  After one of those Amber Alert things  Goes off  You can rustle the papers  Hey, let's take a look at the birthday list  No  Happy birthday to Sam Roberts  Sam is listening to me in Pleasantville  Just to have Sam on the radio  No, no, that's not good 
[02:36:00]  That's fun  All right, thanks  All right, here's the birthday list  Wow  We do have some birthdays in the list  We just had Michelle call  And she said her cousin is 17 years old today  Her name is Hannah Garrick  So happy birthday, Hannah  You've got a great cousin in Michelle  And she also said  Let's see, Chris called  And Chris, her son, Connor  Is having a birthday in Kersley  He's turning 16 years old today  And her best friend, Don Hintz  Is having her birthday as well  Heintz  Don Hintz  She can't even get the list right  And let's see who else to be down here  Well, that woman  Her daughter's turning 17 
[02:36:30]  We don't have her name  Well, here's the thing  If she was up and listening  Yes  She would have called us by name  That's true  She didn't even make sure  That her daughter was up and listening  Shame on you, Mom  All right, if you turned 17 yesterday  And you didn't hear your name  You might be used to give us a call  Chances are the daughter's up  And the mother is not  That could be  All right  Oh, wow  It's so annoying  They're still talking about  Like they're trying to make birthdays  A thing  It's not a thing 
[02:37:00]  Wow, they got a pussy picture  On their website  Oh, that's terrible  Terrible  Some guy named Bill Tetley  Left this comment  Who's Bill Tetley?  I don't know  One of their listeners  Bill Tetley  It was just friendly banter  That's what they were doing  Friendly banter  That's terrible  But who's sitting there going  Oh, God  I love the friendly banter  This is good  I like it  It is wonderful  That birthday  Did you hear  I was listening to Stephanie and Mike  On the way in  Yeah  Did you hear that birthday announcement  They did?  No, tell me about it  It was fantastic  They said that this girl was 17 
[02:37:30]  And that the mother had called  But they forgot her name  And she didn't even call back  Wow, that's kind of crazy  If you're going to set up  Okay, this says  Dennis Falcone is our fuhrer  It's got Dennis  Even though Dennis had a shitty fucking segment on our show today  They are still embracing you as the leader of Jack Tover  Which I kind of appreciate  He's the leader  Photoshopped into a picture of Hitler  Right  Giving a big Nuremberg speech  It's Hitler's body  And a giant podium with a huge swastika on it 
[02:38:00]  Oh, yeah  But Dennis Falcone's head isn't  Dennis  Dennis is our fuhrer  He's the leader of the Jack Tover army  Yeah  What, uh  Oh, no  What do we got?  No, no  What's wrong, Opie?  No  No way  What?  No, no  What's the problem?  The only thing I've ever seen during Jack Tover  That gets Opie this upset  No, no, no  Oh, okay  No, it's not the future  Is that what you think it is?  Oh, no  Okay  And  Oh, no  They are officially done with the birthday topic  Oh, that's good news  They left it a little open-ended  Because of that call 
[02:38:30]  Well, we're still waiting for the 17-year-old  Her name  We need to know her name  But they're stacking up those quarter hours  Is what they're doing  Eating up some, yeah  Some quarter hours  Well, I don't even want to tell you what this track is  Alright, let me hear  Okay  Alright, so what does a woman really keep in her purse?  Interesting  Hi, Danny  See, if we did it, we'd go with, like, coat hanger

Wow, she is  Not one of those TV shows  There was one TV show  It was called Let's Make a Deal  Let's Make a Deal  Well, unless they're a sponsor  You don't want to mention somebody else's brand  Holy fuck  She is a stuttering, muttering fuck  She can't even spit out these words  Yeah, you know what she should have in her purse?  Fucking a handgun  Or fucking  Or arsenic

Thank you  Well, not only that  But she knows exactly where to find it  Now, that's the scary part  But according to a brand new survey  Oh  The average woman in her purse  Mm-hmm  Has toilet paper 
[02:40:30]  I don't have toilet paper  I have tissue  I have like a Kleenex  Who cares?  Spare underwear  Who the fuck cares?  Is it something to wipe your asshole with?

[02:41:00]  Remember we said that  There's something weird going on  On their Facebook page  I don't know  They're getting like weird comments  Sure  I think I know why  Why?  It may not be the Dennis Falcone army  Uh-huh  Okay  There's a picture of Scorch  On the page  Okay  And it says  The PFG army is ready to shut down your Facebook  With obnoxious fake over laughter  And two-shirt dressing attacks  Two-shirt dressing  Is there a battle going on there?  Between the PFG army  Between Scorch and Dennis Falcone? 
[02:41:30]  Yep  They have a lot of dirty pictures in their Facebook  Oh, yeah  Oh, boy  Hey, look  Intern David  It's intern David  With a mustache  With a mustache  Where was that from?  That was before he was an intern  That was his college, like, TV show or something  Look at his dead, lifeless eyes  What the fuck?

The research also revealed that most women carry an average of 40 items inside their purse 
[02:42:30]  When my purse starts to get so heavy I can't lift it, it's on my shoulder, it's hurting  And I try to change my purse  Is this the Roland and Mike show?  This is going great  Oh, my God  What a great anecdote, though  Yeah  I do  I do like that she doesn't talk in a radio voice  But she really does just kind of trip and mumble through the whole experience  She mumbles and her content is useless

You're right  They're dumb for making it a topic  And the listeners are dumb for calling  Right  Why would you call in with that?  Well, everybody wants to have  Their voice on the air  And this is one of those  Like trick phone topics  Where you get a lot of calls  But no listeners  But no substance  Right  Like nobody would want to listen to it  No  Oh, is it terrible?  And it's amazing 
[02:55:00]  Hey, I'm calling about  The best pizza place  In Genesee County  Yes  That would be  Pizza Company  In Davidson  I have never  Never  Oh, is the best  The deep dish  Sorry  It's the best  Mendy's, Jerry  It's the best  Telling the best things  Are to die for  Hi, you're asking for the best pizza restaurant  In Genesee County?

You should have to add in that word  I don't know  And he thinks she's cute  You think Mike's trying to dip into some of that young pussy?  Oh, yeah  Or is this just something we don't understand?  Just innocence  Just general innocence  Nah, it's the pussy thing  You think he's going for the pussy thing?

[02:59:00]  Was great  And they're trying to get my last name  And everything  They're trying to do some investigative  What are they going to do with a name?  They're investigating  Look out  Yeah, so  But that was about it  But they had taken O&A fan calls  Oh, I thought they were taking them on the air  That would be  Oh, never  I would respect that  If you have someone in the air  You can check it out  All right, Josh, thank you  Yeah  All right, back to the birthday thing  Yeah, so I want to say this  Hopefully she got the bus driver  To flip on the radio  Yes

[03:00:30]  But  You could probably hit on something a little more topical  And a little  Well  Maybe it's something that affects the people a little more than pizza month  Yeah, you've got zombies walking around Flint, Michigan at this point  Right?  Interview a zombie every morning  Zombies love pizza, Opie  And all right  It's pizza day or pizza month  It's gotta be  Pizza month  It's gotta be something else you could do with that  I don't even know  But  By the way, that reminds me  Tomorrow is Taco Day  So tune in to our show for Taco Day

Good  Of course she does  Yeah  Remember Sam? 
[03:02:30]  No one remembers Sam  You're on buses and stuff  Sam interviewed me  And it was  The thing about my interview with Sam  Is he  He's weirdly disarming  Really?  And it was a really good interview  And he could have gotten  A lot more out of me than me  Because it was like  Talking to a friend  Or someone  Oh  One of the girls  And then the interview was on the internet  And I was like  I am in the zone  In this interview  And I'm totally not paying attention  To the fact that I'm being interviewed  You could have gotten a lot more out of me  Damn, Sam  That's why I  Sam is disarming 
[03:03:00]  But incompetent  But then we have to ask  What could he have gotten out of you?  I mean  See, I'm smiling a lot  So I'm trying to disarm you as well now  I mean, it was just the two of us in a room  And it was like the last interview  We were talking about tattoos  So  It was fun  Thank you again  Thank you  Geez  Sam Roberts  Am I making you uncomfortable?  No, it's the other three  That are making you uncomfortable  We don't like you being complimented  I know  That's why I'm uncomfortable  Because I'm waiting for the other shoe to fall 
[03:03:30]  No, it was fun  We're not good with compliments around here  We're very insecure  Thank you guys for having me this morning  Of course  I haven't seen you on buses  Yeah  It's amazing  I'm just  What is it  What's it called?  It's a giant  How can I play it?  It's a wrap  They wrap the buses  Right  What's the name of the show?  Because it's on every bus  Raising McCain  Raising McCain  My favorite part about it is how much it has  Can you swear on this show?  Yes  How much it has mind fucked all my ex-boyfriends  Oh man  Seeing your ex-girlfriend on a bus down the street 
[03:04:00]  It makes me so happy  It's nice when they're on the grill of it  Yeah, I know  I've seen a few of mine on milk cartons  Wow  We gotta ask the basic question  What's the show about?  It's a talk show  But it's filmed like a documentary  And we talk about issues that are serious  But we do it in like a fun way  It's really different and experimental  And people really love it  And people really hate it  So take your pick  When I saw you  I saw you at the Comedy Cellar one night  In the Olive Tree 
[03:04:30]  You saw me when I was taping  Right, right, right  Crazy enough  What was the segment you were doing?  That was the one on bullying  And we interviewed Judah Friedlander  He is a bully  Yeah, he's a Friedlander  Yeah, we all know that  World champion my ass at bullying  Exactly  I loved him actually  He's an interesting dude  He is a strange guy  An interesting dude  We talked about how his house had flooded in Queens  And he lived in Queens  And he's like  I was like  You should really be careful about mold  Like that's really dangerous  And he was like  Yeah  I bet mold is dangerous 
[03:05:00]  I bet mold is dangerous  Yeah  Nice, Judah  He's very confusing  Sometimes I think some of his stuff  Is a work  Like I  You know what I mean?  You can't tell with him  You can't tell if he's putting one over on all of us sometimes  I couldn't  What I was  When we were talking in the interview  I was like  So when you're a comedian  I worked with a comedian named Michael Lane Black  Like  Do you get lots of like groupies coming after you?  And he was like  No, no, no  And I was like  Oh  I was just curious  I don't know  So he didn't want to go there with anything personal  Which  Really? 
[03:05:30]  He probably doesn't get a lot of groupies  Maybe there are some Judah groupies  I just don't know about  I don't think that there are  Hey, do you have to watch what you say and do?  Sure  Because John McCain's your dad  It's like  It just seems like  They're always  Like  The press will always try to see  What a brother or a daughter or son or something is doing  So they can try to embarrass the politician  Or get them in some type of trouble  Do you watch what you say sometimes?  Especially with a show  It's kind of  You know  You want to speak your mind  I don't censor myself very much 
[03:06:00]  No?  I kind of think people  People that want to hate Will  And I don't know  People can go fuck themselves  I'm not going to let it change  Ah, see, I like that  But from the point of view of your father  Has he ever given you a talking to?  Like me  Come on  My Playboy interview  He was not happy  Oh, shit  With it all  The whole thing  The whole thing  The fact that I did it  The fact that I was talking about sex  He was humiliated  Oh, man  That one is the one that I might  If I could take anything back  I might not do that again 
[03:06:30]  And it was only 20 questions  I didn't pose or anything  How bad were the questions?  We just talked about sex in the interview  But I thought  If one does an interview with Playboy  And they ask you about sex  In this publication  You should sort of play ball  You know what I mean?  So  But my father was not  Oh, man  Not into it  Not having it  At all  Did you call  He called you?  No, we had lunch in Phoenix  And it was the most awkward  One of the most awkward lunches of my life  And he was like  It was obviously a mistake  And you realize what's on the internet  My press secretary told me  What's on the internet  And it was just  Really embarrassing 
[03:07:00]  What was the worst question  From the interview  You think?  For him  It was just the quote  That got taken out of context  Which one?  I mean, it wasn't taken out of context  I just said  I love sex  And I love men  And it's not the greatest  That's crazy  But coming from a senator's daughter's mouth  And a Republican  Oh, you human being  Ew  I know  But all these people  People went crazy  And they were tweeting me  You know, you're such a slut  And all this stuff  A slut?  Oh, boy  And then I was like  Okay, do you hate sex?  Do you want to say that publicly?  Whatever 
[03:07:30]  And people were very  I was working at MSNBC at the time  And people that I worked with  Were very like  Oh, she was talking about sex in Playboy  And I was like  Get a life  Yeah, exactly  If I were a guy  You would be probably high-fiving me  So  Relax  Tell them to relax  Wow, man  He's a very nice man, your dad  It was so weird  He really likes you  Yeah  They were on the  Tell a Night Show together  Yeah, yeah  And I walked in  And Maggie and I  I guess  Talked the day before  I'm like  I was really happy to do it  I'm like  I'm doing the Tonight Show  With your father  And I'm there  And they're like  John McCain is asking for you 
[03:08:00]  They came into my dressing room  And got me  So me and my Jonathan  Went and talked to him  We had like a really  He's like  We didn't want to bother him  We're standing there  Trying to talk to him politely  But then we're like  Okay, thank you  And he's like  Ah, stay  Like he was  He was having a real conversation  It was odd  Are you like  Are you very political?  Do you delve into  Yeah  Politics?  Yeah?  Yeah, I was  Pretty blown out  After the last election  And just kind of  Over it  And you know  Over the partisanship 
[03:08:30]  And it's a lot of politics  Well, thank God  It got better  Oh, I know  And that's all  Anybody's been talking about  This week  And I'm like  Congress is a bunch of children  That can't get along  And it's  It's amazing  You can't figure it out  But I'm kind of controversial  People really hate me  And people really love me  And people love and hate  My political beliefs  So I don't know  Where do you put yourself  As far as  Which way you lean  You're quite conservative  Is that correct?  Yeah  But I'll surprise conservatives  Like I 
[03:09:00]  Oh, do I love a good abortion?  Oh my God  I don't even give a crap  Let them fly  Oh my God  Let them fly people  Yeah, I don't care about that stuff  I'm not very religious  I'm not like a religious conservative  In that way  I'm pretty  I'm very fiscally conservative  But there are a few ideas  That I think conservatives  Would look at me like  Oh, what are you a liberal?  For gay marriage  Like, yeah  I don't care about gay marriage  Some loosening of drug laws 
[03:09:30]  I'm for some of that  And stuff  But as far as  The hard-hitting issues  Immigration  Guns  Guns  Yes, I'm a huge  Second Amendment guy  Me too  I fucking love a good gun  Yeah  So do I, actually  Do you?  Yeah  Yeah, I'm from Arizona  You're from Arizona  Oh, it's the law there  You pretty much have to have a gun  Oh, it's lawlessness  Yeah  My little brother, Jimmy, at home  He carries his gun on him  And he's like  It's legal here  And you're never gonna know  What happens to me  I'm like, alright, Jimmy 
[03:10:00]  Whatever  Well, I had to go through  About $5,000 in legal fees  And stuff  And about a year straight  To be able to get a carry permit  For New York City  Five grand?  Yeah, it was  And that was pretty cheap  I got off cheap  Yeah, you can't  But that's supposed to be  Your right  I have to pay  And I had to give up information  Like everything  Tax records  Like, why would  Exercising my Second Amendment right  Entail me having to give up  My IRS tax records 
[03:10:30]  It makes no sense whatsoever  It doesn't say  You have the right to bear arms  If you make a certain amount of money  Or if you have a job  Where you carry a lot of money  All that is bullshit  It's been infringed upon  Horrifically  Especially in New York State  It was to deter you, obviously  Yeah  But have some fishy shit  With your taxes  And they'll say  Like, you know what?  I don't need a gun after all  I got out of a ticket yesterday  But it works  By flashing that  And driving away  By pointing the gun  At the cop's face  And I drove off  I didn't even have to fire this time 
[03:11:00]  Yeah, I got pulled over  For making a right turn  On one of those streets  Where you're not allowed to turn  Until you go 50 blocks  Out of your way  Thank you  Thank you  But I turned anyway  And there was a cop  Waiting right there  And they wave you over  How'd you get out of it?  I always do this  First thing I do  Is I take out  The New York City  Pistol permit  And I go here  I just want to let you know  So no one gets nervous here  You know  And he looks at it  Like very surprised  Because they don't  You'd normally get them  And he's like  Oh  And he turns it over 
[03:11:30]  He goes  You have one of these  On you right now?  I was like yeah  He goes  Which one?  I go  The Walter  He goes  Oh  Okay  What do you do?  That you need a guy  I was like  Oh radio show  I was like  Yeah  He goes  Oh Anthony  Oh  He goes  You know Keith Mareska  He was a lieutenant  And stuff  I go  Yeah  He's my security guy  And you know  One of my personal assistants  Oh  Here you go  Take it easy  Well they're probably  A big law enforcement  They're probably  A big fan of the show  Yeah  We give  Kudos to the law enforcement  I think it's a thankless 
[03:12:00]  Horrid job  Where you get into it  Perhaps just for the money  Maybe with this noble idea  That you're going to do something  And you can literally  By doing your job  Be put in jail  Yeah  And lose your freedom  Or lose everything you have  For a misunderstanding  Or just a lapse in judgment  You know  When you make a sandwich  In a deli  And you put the wrong kind of cheese on it  And the guy comes back  You give him another sandwich  You fuck up as a cop  You can go to prison  That's true  But you don't hit the cheese 
[03:12:30]  With a nightstick  If the cheese  Get caught on camera  If the cheese  Is on the news  Every night  Robbing people  You hit the goddamn cheese  Jimmy  I don't mean  You're not supposed to  I mean  But that's what  You get in trouble for  Believe me  I'm all for cheese beating  Can I ask you a question  Since you are  Certainly  Who do you think  Is going to be a good nominee  In the next election cycle  Poof  Well I  It's a hard one right  For the presidential  Or midterm  Presidential  It is 
[03:13:00]  I honestly think  Hillary is going to jump in  And that'll sew that up  I don't think  Biden's got a chance  In hell of being the  Thank God  Yeah  Vice president  Gunna president  Exactly  As far as Republicans  There's so much smack  About Joe Biden  In my life  And I met him in person  He goes  I know you  Oh  Oh really  I was like  Oh shit  Is he unpleasant  No  But he was like  I know you  He should have said  Good  At least I see  Some of your marbles  Are there  He seems like  He's a cool guy though  He doesn't 
[03:13:30]  Not politically  But a guy  You'd want to  Fucking have a beer with  He seems annoying  Like if he was just  A regular guy  At a barbecue  That's not the  Politician I want to  Have a beer with  I don't mean  I don't mean  To talk politics  Are you  That shit  Just to fucking  Hang with him  I don't want to  Hang with him  He's a bit loose  What's your big issue  With him  I just  His like  Gaffes all the time  I don't know  I just  He doesn't inspire me  It's surprising  That he made it  All the way up to VP  Certainly  Some of the things  He has said  I think people forget  How insane  You know  I don't know 
[03:14:00]  I just think  There's a difference  Between Democrats  And Republicans  When it comes to that  I mean  We saw years ago  Dan Quayle  Just get  Viscerated  In the media  For every  Fuck up  He did  And boy  He  I'm not making excuses  He was a bumbling idiot  And could not  Present himself  In an intellectual manner  But Biden's made  Some of the worst  Gaffes I've ever heard  And the press  Just  They just  That's because he's likable  Or he's the vice president  I think it's because 
[03:14:30]  He's a Democrat  And mostly liberal media  And honestly  One of the reasons  He's liked  Is because  It was when your dad ran  People  He was the comparison  With Sarah Palin  And people had very harsh  Feelings about her  So they kind of  Like oh we like him  That was just  Almost by default  People of the VP candidates  Preferred him  So is there anyone  You think  For the next round  I know Christy is  You know  But I've lost respect  For Christy  Me too  As a Republican  I mean  After the hurricane 
[03:15:00]  It was  It was kind of nice  Of him to go  Look I'm putting aside  Our party differences  To get help  For my state  Obviously  But he  It came across  As so much  Ass kissing  On Obama  That he  Lost a lot of  Credibility with me  So  I don't know  He seems a lot more  Moderate than I thought  He was  What  Who else  Like Rubio  People keep telling me  I had this conversation  At my dad's  Birthday party  Actually  And everyone keeps  Telling me 
[03:15:30]  Jeb Bush  Yeah  I don't think  People are ready  For another Bush  That's why I said  I was like  Can you  Too soon  I think the Bush name  Is still tainted  Yeah  I mean  Sorry  But it is  And he is  Quite conservative  I mean  I think he's  Much more  Conservative  Than people realize  So  But after  Eight years  Of Obama  You know  People might be  Ready to  Make that  Flip flop  To more  Conservatives  Because  I don't know  We are in a weird  Place right now  We are in a weird  Place right now  It's  Nobody's getting  Along  I think 
[03:16:00]  Both sides  Are more  They're concentrating  More on the next  Election than they  Are what's good  For the country  They don't want  To do anything  That makes the  Other party  Look good  Like oh  That's a great  Idea  I'll support it  I'll go past  Party lines here  And support your  Idea  And then it's  Just used against  You in the  Election  He actually  And Republicans  Supported  This  So vote for him  So no one  Wants to do it  Because you don't  Want to become  A campaign ad  For the other  Guy  During the midterm  So nothing  Gets done  I don't know 
[03:16:30]  How you feel  About this  But I don't  Like that  There's no  Term limits  Because it  Puts these guys  In a professional  Politician  Position  They have no  Incentive to do  Anything for the  Country  There's more  Incentive to do  Stuff to keep  Their job  The second  They're elected  They're thinking  What's going to  Keep me in  For the next  Election  So it's very  Counterproductive  For the country  As a whole  I agree with that  One time when I  Was in college  I went to visit  My dad in the  Senate  And you can  Senators  There's a Senate  Dining room  Where they eat lunch  And I remember  Seeing Strom Thurmond 
[03:17:00]  And he couldn't  Even  He had a  Nurse or a  Handler with him  Because he was  So old  And I was like  You're still  Allowed to be in  Office when you  Can't stand  And I just  I even remember  When you can't  Function properly  You can't feed  Yourself  You know he's  Not doing the job  To the best of  The ability that  Really needs to be  Had in that  Circumstance  But I'll never  Forget that  The public's  Kind of dumb  For continually  Electing people  Just on their  Names  That's true  To get so used  To Strom Thurmond 
[03:17:30]  Instead of going  Wow he's a little  Old  They continue  Voting him in  Like robots  The lack of term  Limits is a reflection  Of our stupidity  We should be able  To get people out  Right right  If there's no term  Limits you know  It's up to the voters  So you should be  Able to vote  For a new person  That comes in  But you're right  Yeah people are  Just you know  Oh it's coke  I'll vote for coke  Because I see  The fucking  The name all over  The place  Yeah yeah  Are you drinking  Carrot juice over there  Well it's beets  Carrots  Spinach 
[03:18:00]  Well not the health  Part  I like a good  Vegetable juice  A good beet juice  Right on  I'm trying to lose  The baby weight there  Megan  Can we talk about  How good Jim looks  Oh please  Well that's why  He was doing this shit  He does  He looks great  It's amazing  When I saw you  At the comedy salon  I was like  You look totally different  We've seen some  Older pictures of him  People post them  It's like oh  Here's me with Jimmy  From a couple years ago  He was at a club  And it's like wow  You really  You see how much weight 
[03:18:30]  He lost  It was terrible  I'm still an asshole  Yeah  I haven't become  A better person  I'm just  A part of the spot  In a crowd  I'm still an asshole  I'm still human garbage  But I'm just  I'm a medium  But yeah it's really  Wow  Let me see  The one with the  Yellow flowers  I was at that photo shoot  Oh that was 2003  Holy fuck  That's 10 years ago already  That's me  You just had it on the other page  I mean don't look at the form  No the other page  Who's that?  That's Paula Paddington  Yeah she's beautiful  She was from Mission Impossible 
[03:19:00]  She's what's his name  Robin Thicke's wife  Yeah yeah  She's beautiful  That one  That's  Wow  Why would you take a picture  In your underwear like that?  It was a goof  I did it on purpose  It was for a CD  Okay  Yeah  They want me to do a photo shoot  That's going to be  The new background on my phone  I was dating a girl in 2003  And whenever they would ask  For press pictures  I would send that one  And there was a double page centerfold  In a magazine  And then her brother  Had left it out  And goes  That's who you're dating  That's the guy you're dating 
[03:19:30]  I agree  Did she like  Did she  She didn't care for that at all  She didn't care  Yeah yeah  We stopped seeing each other  Soon after  Is that the one you were dating  When we were doing  The Jane Leno show?  Oh no  This is back  This is again  This is now  It's 10 years ago  Oh okay  Never mind  We did that for  I guess what  I guess  Eight months together  Six months together  Yeah it was really  We had  How we know each other  Is the most random way  Anybody knows each other  We did this panel  On the Jane Leno show  With Stephen Baldwin  That's right  Ariana Huffington  Me and Jim  Hold on  I remember that  And Diablo Cody  Sure 
[03:20:00]  And I just remember  It's like  The apocalypse came  That's a weird  Collection deal  You and I became regulars though  And I did it  Once with the Kardashians  It was really  I remember that  But we did it  A few times together  You were always cool  That's how we became  Pressed  Just like talking backstage  But there was  Stephen Baldwin was an interesting  Dude  He's an odd guy  Yeah he is  We've had our run-ins  With him  He's an interesting man  How about Ariana Huffington  Did you not like her  He's a weirdo  No I thought she was  Really nice  As a person right  She's really nice  She's always been 
[03:20:30]  Really nice to me  Oh okay  I thought she had given  Like it's always weird  Somebody write stuff  About you  Or the family  Or the whatever  No the Huffington Post  Has actually been  Really cool to me  Oh they have been  Okay  Yeah that's not the  I don't have a problem  With the Huffington Post  You know what's odd  About like  You look at the media  And the way they treat  People based on party lines  Your father gets more respect  They're not as willing  To really jump on him  About policies  They don't agree with  And the press isn't  As willing to rip him apart  I've seen them do it 
[03:21:00]  But they're not as willing  To rip him apart  As they would  Some other politicians  He's very well respected  You think  Yeah  Because he comes across  As a real guy  Yeah  Which you don't get  A lot of that  From those guys down there  Yeah  Sometimes I hear people  And I'm just like  Brutal  Just brutal  Oh really  I don't know  I mean a lot of people  A lot of people  Really hate my dad  Oh yeah  We know that  Of course  Yes  I don't  I mean  But I think to be  A politician in America  Is to be controversial  I don't think there's anyone  Even Obama's not beloved anymore 
[03:21:30]  Do you like him  No  President Obama  Yeah  I mean obviously  I didn't vote for him  And I don't believe in him  But I don't think  He's the antichrist  Like some people  Some people do  But I'm not a fan of him  I just  I don't like his leadership  As a president  I mean if you look  At everything with Syria  I think it's a very  Classic example  It's like a lack thereof  Yeah  Just incapability  Of making a decision  And making a move  Just make a move  You're the fucking president  Right right  Sorry  I don't  You can swear on the show  No you can  Sure  You know  Just make an executive decision 
[03:22:00]  And stop having to go back  To Congress  And poll it  And see what's popular  What's not popular  Being president  Is not always going to be popular  His entire presidency  And even  You could tell  During the campaign  You could tell  Even though there's so much  Bullshit during a campaign  You can kind of feel out  What a guy is  As a person  Very  Thought out  You could say  But it's just this  Like  Not willing to commit  Yeah  Just going in  Having a fun  Rah-rah speech  And stuff  But not really ever 
[03:22:30]  Committing to  Anything  And when you have  To act quickly  That's why I don't think  He had as much to do  With that  Osama bin Laden raid  Than everybody  Pumped him up to  Because he's only proven  That he's very indecisive  When it comes to  Important issues  That need  To be  Done very quickly  I think  They approached him  I think  He said  Yes  Let's do this  And then  The planning  And everything else  Was  Off of his shoulders  And I think  It comes to a great shock 
[03:23:00]  To him  When people don't like him  I think he's very  Very arrogant  When it comes to that  Yeah  I'm the greatest  Thing in the history  Of history  You don't like me  Look what I did  I think it's weird  Who's like  One or two  Presidents  That you  Would call your favorites  And did a great job  Yeah  Yeah  Who like  Well, Lincoln  Who do you think  Oh, President  Budinsky  There you go  I mean  Like all  No, like  Did you  Like Reagan  Oh, yeah  Reagan always gets 
[03:23:30]  My thing with  Ronald Reagan too  Is  If you really  Study Reagan  In history  You can't call yourself  People like Ted Cruz  That call themselves  A Reagan Republican  Yeah, yeah, yeah  Cracks me up  I'm like  He was a person  Who  Went across party lines  With Tip O'Neill  Really tried to make  This country a better place  Really was into  Working with the other side  And people now  If you even  Work on the other side  A little bit  You are a heretic  And you should go  Fuck yourself  And you shouldn't be  In politics anymore  Because you don't know  You really feel  I mean  How dare you  Call yourself  A Reagan Republican 
[03:24:00]  Some of these people  Yeah, yeah, yeah  How dare you  It's a disgrace  To Ronald Reagan's legacy  Do you ever look  At what happened  Like  Because I thought  When McCain lost  He was very graceful  In his speech  I thought his speech  Was better than Obama's  Accepted speech  I just thought  I found his  To be more moving  And you know  As somebody who would  Have been the first daughter  I mean that's a pretty  You gotta be bummed out  Yeah, like  What is that like  No, I'm not bummed out  That part of it  A cool thing  To go through though  I don't think  It'd be a cool thing  No?  I'm actually  You're kind of relieved  That's the  I think my father  Would have been  A great leader  And I think this country 
[03:24:30]  Would be in a much  Better place  If he were president  But being a first daughter  Sounds like it blows  And I'm crazy  I'm rebellious  That's why  It would have been awesome  I would have been  For you two  For you assholes  It would have been great  We would have loved  To watch it  Especially on the heels  Of those Bush girls  They were a little wild  In their  Do you really think  They were wild  In their youth  Nah  Not after they got  A little older  But that  Freaking fake IDs  And out partying  And drinking  Like everybody  Hasn't done that  I know  But when you're 
[03:25:00]  In the White House  You gotta watch  What you're doing  Megan would be  The one throwing  The party  When daddy was  Out of town  Is that it really?  The risky business  Party at the house  Mom and dad  Are out of town  We're throwing  A party in this bitch  Oh man  I would not have done that  I don't think  No?  No  I mean  I think it's just more  People scrutinize  Things now  Beer pong in the  Lincoln bedroom  That would drool  And I would invite  All of you  The three  That would be great  Pulling up  Pulling up to the gate  Yeah we're here  For the party  Jim Norton  I'm just gonna play 
[03:25:30]  Some beer pong  Beer pong  In the Lincoln bedroom  I want to watch  This show of yours  We haven't really  Talked about it  Raising McCain  Thank you  It's on Saturdays  10 to 10 on Pivot TV  I don't know  You can also get it  On iTunes  Pivot's a brand new  Network that just launched  If you go to  Pivot.tv  You can see where  You get it  It's one of those  Things that's gonna  Wind up in a bunch  Of  Some of them  Are not in all  But people forget  That HBO Comedy Central  They all took a while  To get into  All their cable  But you also  Just go to iTunes  Fuck it  Yeah and I knew  What I was getting into  When I was going 
[03:26:00]  With a new network  But I don't know  I really believe in them  And they give me  Such creative freedom  I'm an executive producer  On my show  And I just had a lot  Of fun this summer  When I saw you Jim  You were having so much fun  And I think having fun  And enjoying the people  You work with  Is maybe  Is the key to happiness  In this life  Other than finding  Somebody  You know  Finding a partner  How long after you air  Did it appear on iTunes  It airs just like  Two or three days after  Oh okay  I see good  The network's cool with that too  What do they look at  Like is branding for them  The fact that  Yeah the more people  Seeing it the better  Yeah they'll find you 
[03:26:30]  You're looking at  You're looking at  My episode right now Sam  That's right  Is he not allowed to talk  On this show  Oh Sam talks  He talks way too long  Ask the listeners  Oh my god  He talks way too much  It was actually  It was actually  A nice break  He's walking in and out  Like you're  You know  He actually works  On this show  Yeah  He pretty much runs  The entire show  At this point  See he bamboozled you  By doing an interview  With you first  Right  Because you assumed  He was a radio show host  He's a scrub 
[03:27:00]  For the O.B. and Anthony show  That happens to go on air  Every so often  You throw him scraps  I guess I'm the scrap  No you know what  But think about it  You were  In the long line  Of guests  For the Sam Roberts  After show  Like  Let me think  Loverboy  Loverboy  Loverboy  Yeah the Loverboy  Loverboy  I interviewed  The band Loverboy  I interviewed a lot  Of very famous  Talented  Who's Loverboy  Loverboy  Oh the band Loverboy  Everybody's working 
[03:27:30]  For the weekend  How was that  I got him to sing  Working for the weekend  What else are they  Going to do  Well they didn't want to  So in all fairness  To Sam  What did you guys talk about  Well we talked about  The fact that a prank caller  That sounded much like  Anthony Cumia  Was making fun of  His red leather pants  You wear red leather pants  No I was making fun  Of the guy  I was wearing red leather  Pants from  From Loverboy  I was driving home  We sabotage  We sabotage  We sabotage  His show  Constantly  Which is what they're 
[03:28:00]  Doing right now actually  By making you believe  That it's not a real show  It's a real show  Thank you  I'm a real guest  And it was a real show  What about this episode  That's up on the website  This was the one  That aired last week  That was about  Has technology  Killed romance  And dating  And it was  This episode  Was particularly awkward  Because they set me  And my producers  Up on a group date  And it was horrible  Group date  It was horrible  I know  I mean  The people were very nice  But I think dating  In general is uncomfortable  Let alone when there are cameras around  Boy 
[03:28:30]  That was the bookend  But that one was a fun one  What was the conclusion  That it had  Because I have mixed feelings  Like it ruins monogamous relationships  For people in my age group  Because we're such creeps  Do chicks tweet you  Or any of you  And hear the tweet  The opening Anthony show  And be like  I want to go out with Anthony  Oh no  Look at us  Of course they do  Just drowning in pussy  It is odd though  It is odd though  Because people  Will get in touch  With you  And tweet you  Comments and things 
[03:29:00]  That like  They normally  Wouldn't have any  Way of saying  Anything to you  In the old days  You know  So that's kind of weird  You don't need the face to face  You could get rid of  The preliminary bullshit  Now online  Through text  So you could be  A little more bold  When you used to have  To go to a bar  Or a club  Where the fuck  You met people back then  You'd have to put  Your game face on  And approach somebody  It was frightening  Now all that  Preliminary stuff  You're just like  Yeah you want to fuck  And you get a no 
[03:29:30]  And you walk away  It's like  You know  You get to see  Their pussies  Before you meet them  It's kind of true  If you want  Oh my god  What's going to be  On Saturday shows  Screw the show  That already aired  Let's promote the new one  The one coming up  Is about coming out  In America  And being  And how millennials  Come out earlier  And what happens  If you support gay marriage  As a young person  But your family doesn't  Sam  It's a good show for you  I'm not a homosexual  Are you married  Yes to a female

And then nine years later  You got married  And the next day  You realize you made a mistake  Yeah  Seriously  It's terrible  And then nine years later  He did something about it  And nine years later  I decided to get out of it  But I was doing radio 
[03:33:00]  Like I was just getting into radio  So it was a good distraction  I was just like  Did you panic the next day?  Yeah  Yeah  Anxiety  But you had nothing to lose  By getting a divorce  What could they have taken from you  Back then?  Yeah once it was over  It was over  Back then I should have  No I paid through the notes  You would have got your jet ski  I think  That's about it  How old were you  When you got married?  Uh  30  30  30  No offense Sam  I'm sure you'll be very happy  I'm sorry  I don't mean to judge  I just don't  I especially don't understand  Why men would get married 
[03:33:30]  You're right  Well in my case  I was with my wife  From when I was like 22  She's very hot  Yeah I'm not going to do any better  Yeah  Right on  She certainly could  And if you really love her  Like go forth and conquer  I just  I don't know  That sounds like a great marriage  I'm not going to do any better  I'm definitely not  I love her  It turned me off to marriage  There's some people that are  Like monogamous and like it  I just  I don't know  I just think it seems outdated  Yeah  I mean one person for like 50 years 
[03:34:00]  I don't know  Cause we're living longer than we used to  Don't forget  Back in Roman times  People lived to be 35 or whatever  Alright  Who wants to be sitting there  While your fucking wife is like  Morty I have the Swiffer  And he's trying to sleep  And she's yelling at him  Morty  It's some type of a mopping device  Oh yeah  It's like a time machine  Crazy old broad  These commercials have taken the romance out of it  Yeah  Yeah  I would never  I would never get married again  I talk about marriage like 
[03:34:30]  Quint talks about that shark attack  On the Indianapolis  I'll never put on a life jacket again  Nope  I'll never put on a wedding ring again  She went to the divorce lawyer  Her eyes rolled back white  Lifeless eyes like a doll's eye  The idea of getting married  And the next day being like  Oh shit  I fucked up  Sounds insane  It was terrible  I'm sorry  But thank god we didn't have any kids  Yeah  We had no real assets  And you only fucked up a decade of your life  And it was a decade of my life  Now the only responsibility 
[03:35:00]  Oh who hasn't  I have is a kitten  And uh  My girl turns 19 on the 11th  Yeah  And they've been dating for 10 years  I don't know if you're talking about your daughter  Or your girlfriend  I don't have a daughter  Okay  She's like this  Me?  Oh there's so no judgment  Oh my god  Don't worry  I won't bother  Listen  Smoke if you got them  Smoke if you got them  If you can get a college student 
[03:35:30]  I guess go for it  Whatever  That's what I like  Not here to judge  Yeah  Alright we gotta get out of here  You look bored on your phone  Oh no no no  Not at all  I like this a lot  Okay  I hope I didn't give that impression  Are you tweeting?  Tweet  Yeah I'm reading tweets  Tweet  They like you  Yeah  Oh good  You're fun  Thanks everybody  You're fun  Thanks for having me on  Let's plug the show  I didn't know much about you  I thought you  I was thinking  Wrongly  That you were gonna be a little stuffy 
[03:36:00]  Really?  Maybe  Yeah I thought you was gonna be a little like  Oh man  Watch what you say around her maybe  I like that  Nah  You're one of the guys  I think I said drowning in pussy on the show  Yes you did  So I think we're fine  I'm also really happy to know  That you listen to my interviews  That's cool  It was probably one of the days  I was staying in the city  And not driving home  It's on YouTube  I'm not gonna search out  Your goddamn interviews  Holy fuck  If the radio happens  Be on home  I'll listen  Do you just hate him?  Wins isn't doing a fucking weather forecast  I wouldn't listen to your interview  If I was the guy you were talking to 
[03:36:30]  She does like you Sam  I do like him  His interview  I'm telling you  I've been interviewed  Thousands of times  He's a good interviewer  Wow  Like I said  But you will get stronger  Because you could have gotten a lot more  Like I said  I would have dished a lot more  Damn  But you blew it  Sam  And now it's gone  Sam  Yeah but I'm awesome  And have potential to get even better  But you've been at it for 10 years right  Let's be honest  I'm young though  You're hitting the ceiling 
[03:37:00]  I'm very young  Yeah you're young  But that voice ain't changing my friend  It's not about the voice  Well apparently it is  I like his voice  Over at Entertainment Weekly  I think you're smitten with this fucking  Whatever you  I like your  I mean I guess you have to have a nice voice to be in radio  That's right you do  Apparently but not good enough for Entertainment Weekly  Entertainment Weekly told him  He couldn't have the job  Because of his voice  They said they like him  They like what he talks about  She's laughing at you  I'm sorry  No it's okay  They said your voice sucked 
[03:37:30]  They literally said that my demo was better than anybody else  But they could not get over the sound of my voice  Yeah  Which is why I'm still here  I'm enjoying  They could have put some processing on your mic  They could have kind of fixed that  They could have just gotten over it  Whatever  You can't change that either  That's not something you can change  No  Sam Falcone  Yes  You look at Denny  That's your future  No it's not  Oh god  I'd hang myself now  If that was my future  I can't believe you thought  She'd be stuffy or whatever  I didn't know 
[03:38:00]  I didn't know  I just assume  Most people that are around  Republican senators  Daughters  Don't worry  Right exactly  Maybe I should be stuffier  Maybe I'm in this conflict right now  That I'm like  Maybe I should have been very proper  Although daughters  Although daughters of more conservative people  Are usually pretty god damn wild  No  No  No there was this religious family  That lived around the neighborhood  And they had like  Three or four daughters  But is that like a preacher's daughter thing  No he was a doctor  But he was  They were staunch  And oh boy  Those girls  Wow  Did you date one of them 
[03:38:30]  Two of them  Two  My brother dated one  Well done  Yeah  It was kind of  One of my friends  Dated the fourth one  It's because repression breeds obsession  Because if you're repressed your whole life  You're just going to want to go buck wild  Ran through that  Family like locust  Nice  You're just drowning in pussy  That is going to be my mother's favorite thing  From this morning  Oh yeah  Oh boy  Does she listen to all your interviews  She listens to a lot of women 
[03:39:00]  Oh man  I kind of  I apologize  Talk like a trucker  I gotta get over it  That's the thing with this show too  Everyone's like  She has the filthiest mouth  And I was like  You know maybe I should button it up  And whatever  No it's good  It's good  Because you don't want to be typical  You don't want to just  You want to be yourself  You don't want to be a typical  Like oh this is what the  Republican daughters send  Their shirts  Because then no one listens  But people listen  When you sound different  And like yourself  Just be yourself  Yeah of course  It's interesting  Thanks  Much more interesting  I saw Chelsea Clinton on  What the hell was she on  Might have been Daily Show 
[03:39:30]  But wow  She doesn't look like  She curses  At all  No she's more  You know she seems more like  A kind of a goody  She's got it  I like Chelsea Clinton  Yeah  I think she's  She's obviously  The other end of the spectrum  Oh yeah  Very proper  Very proper  Very  Part of me is like  Envious of that  I'm like oh I should have  She'd be such a proper lady  Oh no  Instead I'm going on  The opening Anthony show  Saying pussy  Opening  No but don't forget  You know her dad also  Had a weird  It's almost like 
[03:40:00]  She went the opposite direction  Because of the  The scandal that happened  Maybe  All of a sudden  Her dad was actually  President  That's true  Look at the scandal  He had was so  Not prim and proper  At all  And then she goes  In this other direction  And your father gets  A tremendous amount of respect  Do you interview a lot of  Politicians on this show?  They won't come on  Yeah they won't really  Come on  We've had  I think they're under  The impression that  We're just going to  Let's give her the list  Fuck around  We've had Rumsfeld  And Louis C.K.  Blew that one 
[03:40:30]  Yeah Louis did  Why did Louis C.K.  Well he wanted to know  If he was a lizard  And he wouldn't get off  That  He just kept asking him  If he was  Which by the way  I thought was awesome  I thought was hilarious  What did Donald Rumsfeld say?  He just kept denying  He was a lizard  He never denied it  Right  He refused to answer  He refused to answer  You know what  That's right  Which only got Louis  Going even more  So you're not  You're not denying  That you might be a lizard  Was he co-hosting the show  Or was he on the show  Yeah he was here  He was here  Louis C.K. used to do  Your show a lot  I would say  On a regular basis  Anyway right  Yeah  And then they go famous 
[03:41:00]  And then what happens  They go famous  He still comes on though  He'll be back  Yeah  He put us on a show  Which was nice  And then you know  Who we don't see  Who we don't see around  As much anymore either  Amy Schumer  Yeah  Oh you know  Judd Apatow movie  Oh I love Amy Schumer  Who doesn't?  She's America's sweetheart  She's so funny  And now we won't see her  She's a pig  Talk about filthy  Oh my gosh  I heard her on Howard Stern  She's a dirty birdie  I was like  Lord you're making me blush  And I'm not  Nothing easy to do  Yeah she's a dirtbag  You ever see her  Tell her 
[03:41:30]  She's a dirtbag  Oh yeah she is  Trust me  She's a compliment  That was a compliment  I love Amy  I was going to tell you  The cab story  Where she had a cab driver  Diddle her  She like  Slept with her cab driver  Cab driver  Slept with  That would even be reasonable  She had the cab driver  Diddle her  While they were driving  Oh my god  Uptown  Uptown  What other politicians  I'm trying to think  That might be it  Jesse the body  Ventura  Jesse the body  Ventura  Used to come on our show  He got in a fight with you  Yes  Right  He was like 
[03:42:00]  Trying to threaten you  Or something  No no no  It was just an unpleasant  Argument that got  Blown out of proportion  He was just being an ass  No I didn't feel  Physically threatened  Until the very end  When he walked out  I thought he was  Going to throw his  Waterball at me  My favorite thing  Is he was wearing  A fanny pack  In a video I saw  He was  Sitting down  I was like  What the hell  Why is he wearing  A fanny pack  And when Jimmy said  Get out of here  With your riffraff hairdo  Oh that was perfect  He got none too pleased  He got hammered  By intelligence that day  And he got so frustrated  That he wanted to be  An alpha male about it  Never fight with a comedian  He got his ass kicked 
[03:42:30]  Ever  But it wasn't about that  Just talking about 9-11  And simple fucking questions  To him  He had no real answer  And he was getting  He's like a truther  Right  Why was  Why was the fire department  Told to stand down  He just wanted us to accept  It's a really good impression  Oh thank you  He just wanted us to accept  What he was saying that day  And we just kept challenging him  With more and more questions  And his brain  We saw it  Just blew up  He was  Oh he's a maniac  He was in way over his head  And then he got frustrated  And started that alpha male shit  And then Jimmy didn't 
[03:43:00]  You know back down  Which I fucking loved  I never would have spoken  That way to him  I would have debated him  But I never would have been  That rude to him  If he hadn't been  An asshole to me  First  But I would never  Would have just insulted  On his way out  Because I respect him  He got so frustrated  He just went for like  What did he say  What was the famous line  As he was walking out  We were just  He called me an asshole  So I called him an asshole  It just went like  Back and forth like that  And then when he was walking out  He was like  Because implying that  I wasn't in the military  He patted me on the back  Really hard  He goes  Thanks for your service  Oh my god 
[03:43:30]  Which I didn't care about  But it was like  For me to match that  But he wasn't being medicine  He was just being a dick  But I would have had to  Stand up and pat him  And I'm like  I'm not going to touch him  So that's why  I said something nasty  Should have popped him  Right in the face  What's the worst interview  You guys ever did  Paris Hilton  This one  Paris Hilton  Oh Jesus  Paris  Paris Hilton  Was terrible  Paris Hilton came on this show  She was horrendous  Why  She was promoting  She needed us that day  Dumb album  Her reality show  Her reality show  Which we were more  This is like back in the day  Right  It was the one after  Her successful reality show  The recent-ish one  Just about two years ago 
[03:44:00]  The one that was  A complete failure  Got cancelled  Why was it so bad  There was something  In the news  We asked her about  And she got all  She wouldn't  Answer the question  Well she had the one  With Lionel Richie's daughter  There  Nicole  That was a great show  I actually enjoyed that  And it worked  And then they didn't  They broke up as friends  And then she tried to  Come up with another  Reality show  Where it was kind of  Just her  And it was just  Terrible  And she came on  And she wouldn't  Talk about anything  It's like  Yeah okay  No I don't want to  Talk about that  She thinks she's God's gift 
[03:44:30]  You have to watch the show  It was horrible  So what happened  And she kept looking  At her publicist  To save her and stuff  And we weren't even  Asking crazy questions  She stunk her  We hated her  15 minutes maybe  Top  Yeah  We pretty much  Kicked her out  And she cancelled  The rest of her interviews  After that  Yeah she's a fucking  She went home  She went home  Like a little baby  But again her show  Got cancelled  And nobody gives a shit  About her  We didn't go  We didn't go all in  We were actually  Pretty nice to her  We got a little frustrated  But it wasn't anything crazy  Yeah and I wasn't  Vicious to her  Because she wasn't being mean 
[03:45:00]  She was just being herself  Which is just sucky  And valueless  She's a dullard  She has nothing  Of substance to say  What's crazy to me  Is she's like 32  Or 33  Yeah yeah  She's not a kid anymore  No no  She introduced the world  To Kim Kardashian  And she's never  Gotten over that  Because Kim took  All her fame  And that's why  She was trying to  Come back with that show  It was a bomb  It was horrible  But a reality show  And in the interview  She's not forthcoming  At all  Like you  You almost  Were the first daughter  Of the country  And yet 
[03:45:30]  You talk more openly  About yourself  Than this fucking  Fake  Spoiled brat  She's a hell of a lot  More famous than me  But you know  You know what I'm saying  Though  But who cares  I think you can't  She was terrible  You can't be in this  Industry if you can't  Like play ball  A little bit  You gotta give it up  For you know  Yeah  Or just be open  And fun  Like not even  We didn't care about  Talking about sex  Or any of that  She was just a shit  Interview  And she was just  Snotty  And she didn't  Want to be there  It was like  Well then go home  Dummy  Your reality show  Is awful  I didn't say that to her  Do you have a second worst 
[03:46:00]  Second worst interview  I didn't love  He was not one of the worst  Ludicrous  I didn't like  Because he was  Very defensive  And because he thought  We were trying to  Throw him under the bus  Talking about  But we weren't  We were just trying to  It's a 25 minute interview  So we were asking  A lot of questions  But he  What about Terrell Owens  Terrell Owens was boring  He kept  Yeah he was boring  Correcting us  Because he wanted  To be called Terrell  Terrell  Screech  Screech was terrible  Screech was  Well  You had Screech on him  Yeah  Well I mean  If you want the worst 
[03:46:30]  Interview ever  It was Balloon Guy  We all know  What's Balloon Guy  He came in and  Made balloon animals for us  And you interviewed him  About making balloons  Did you book that Sam  I did not  Sam was in diapers  When we did that  That's how old we are  Was it like the beginning  Of the show  It has to be  It could be 14 years ago  Oh my god  Something like that  Any W  Yeah he  I forgot why  He was on some show  I had no idea  A reality show  And he came in  And also like  Oh my god  All he could do 
[03:47:00]  Is make balloon animals  On the radio  It was so bad  He was  All you heard  To the whole interview  Was that  Right  Oh god  That's right  I wish I was there  And they weren't  Even good balloon animals  Really  But remember  All we heard  Was the noise  That's it  Oh my god  It's a dog  Terrible radio  For everybody  That can't see it  Yeah yeah  It's a snake  Oh look  Okay  And then play by play  Alright he's blowing up  One of those long balloons  And he's tying it off 
[03:47:30]  Right now  Yeah yeah  And then again  That was terrible  That was the worst interview ever  Yep  That was a bad one  These are good ones  As far as big celebrities  I'm trying to think  Most of them are pretty good  Terrell Owens sucked  He wasn't great at all  Floyd Mayweather was not great  He was just tired  With his sunglasses on  I was like come on man  He was alright  Yeah he wasn't terrible  The listeners would help us out  I'm sure  There's been a few  There's ones we probably  Forgot about  I'm looking down  Trying to see if they  Know anyone  Guys who were like  I'll tell you 
[03:48:00]  The most uncomfortable  One of them was  George Wendt  We had him in  I don't even know who that is  And he was on Cheers  That guy Norm on Cheers  Okay  It was me and Jimmy that day  Oh I forgot about George Wendt  Yeah I wasn't in  He wrote a book  What a great interview that was  He wrote a book  About beer  About beer  He wrote a book  About his favorite beers  So I was asking him  Alcohol questions  It's like your book's about it  No but Jim started asking him  Questions about like  Whether or not he questions  If he's an alcoholic or not  And I tried to get like  Really deep with him 
[03:48:30]  And he just Norm from Cheers  And wanted to write a fun book  About it  I didn't want to hear about that  I didn't care why he likes lager  It's boring  No he wasn't  The problem was  He wasn't being Norm  He was a bummer  And I told him  He was a bummer  Because he was all red faced  And he came across  Like he was indeed  An alcoholic  Yes  Struggling with this issue  I love a train wreck interview  There's very few things I love more  Than a fucking just off the rails train wreck  People going crazy  That's why I love Anthony Weiner so much  It's just he would just 
[03:49:00]  Oh god  Oh I loved it  He started just losing his mind  In the deli with that guy  And then when he was running through McDonald's  Getting away from his porn star sexting lady  I'm like  Anybody who thinks entertainment is better than politics  Is not watching this shit on the internet right now  And we love that he didn't back out  Oh me too  Because most of the time those guys go  Oh fuck I gotta back the fuck out  But he was still in there  Which I loved  As more time went on  He realized his chances were slimmer and slimmer  Of actually being  And he got more and more angry  With the interview  You see him on Lawrence O'Donnell  When that freak out interview 
[03:49:30]  Oh yeah that was great  I was like what in the  My favorite thing is  They were like  They're screaming  They just scream at each other  And they're like  We're going to a commercial break  And we'll be right back  And then they came back from the commercial  And screamed again  I'm like  Somebody's screaming in my face like that  I'd be like  I'm fucking out of here  Yeah I'm not gonna sit through  The commercial break  Both of them just love  Hearing themselves talk  Oh hell yeah  But to all the Americans  Who say  You want a guy who represents the average  How come we don't have power  You had a chance  You're never gonna get a more  A man that represents men  Better  A wiener?  Than him  He blew a second chance though 
[03:50:00]  That was our whole  It is not the sexting  It is not the sexting  Thank you  I am not judgmental on things like that  People have issues  Whatever  It is the lying  That's what I can  But  For the second time  That's what I mean  We all allowed him a second chance  But what guy would  Think about it  What guy wouldn't  First of all  It's none of our business  And I don't even like wiener that much  He shouldn't have come back  As soon as he did  If he knew all that shit  Was still out there  But it's none of our business  Because at that point  He knew how all  How twitter and everything else worked  They knew it was a 
[03:50:30]  A matter of time  Before they  You know  Caught on to what he was  Doing  But we shouldn't care  Continue what to do  It shouldn't be an issue  Not about the sex thing  But it shows like  A lack of commitment  To something  Like it shows  Poor judgment  It shows  Like forget about the sex part  Take the sex part out of it  What he did though  Is he's got a commitment  To his wife  He blew that  He lied  It shows  It's a test of character  Sex and food  Are the same addiction  Chris Christie  Obviously is a compulsive overeater  Right  But I'm saying like  Okay he doesn't cheat on his wife 
[03:51:00]  But he is putting himself  In danger of a heart attack  Right  So I mean  Every person has this type of shit  And we just kind of stand back  And watch them get crucified  It's not like he was having sex with a kid  Or even  Like Spitzer banging hookers  Like he wasn't doing any of that  He was just being a dope  And talking to  Who cares  It's not an issue  That said  I wouldn't have voted for him anyway  Little  Yeah yeah  I think  New York screwed  With de Blasio  It's the lying  I wouldn't make it on that  But if he told the truth  People would have still  Let him be crucified  Like if he would have  Come right out  And said I'm going to keep doing it  I don't know  The very first time  I have a problem 
[03:51:30]  This is a sex addiction  Or whatever  Whatever it is  Between me and my wife  She's okay with it  You guys are going to have to deal with it  I think America  Appreciates that  Everyone accepted that  I would just be a fucking man  Right  I've got an issue  It's not going to  Have anything to do with how I govern  Move on  And we accepted that  Because his poll numbers  Were really good for a while  Until the second scandal  He had a real shot at it  Yeah  And then the second scandal  They were like  What you never stopped  What the fuck you told us  It's because he made his wife come out too  And as a woman  You know  Just seeing her  How close is she to Hillary  She's like Hillary's 
[03:52:00]  Best friend or something  Right hand  Right hand woman  Yeah  And she is a cool  Freaking lady  She seems it  I've met her numerous times  And she's a cool chick  And you know  He's a fucking idiot  He is  But look again  Look what Bill did  I mean Bill did  Was far  And I don't mind it  I could care less  But it's far more of an offense  Than what Wiener did  And we don't care anymore  It's far more of an offense  Look at Larry Clegg  He's trying to blow people  In a men's room  And he pleads guilty  And goes  Oh I meant to say not guilty  That's what politics is 
[03:52:30]  Jimmy's just putting examples  Of good and bad  These are the people  I would vote for  Wide stance Larry  The wide stance  I have a wide stance  Do you remember his interview  With the policeman  That leaked out  And the policeman  He was like  You represent people  And he's like  Now hold on  Now hold on  He's trying to defend himself  From just digging the hole  Digging a deeper hole  Yeah yeah  Digging the hole deeper  And we forgave  We don't give a fuck  Yeah we don't care  I think Americans  Will forgive  You just have to be honest  We do  You know you have an issue  And I think especially  When it comes to sex related stuff 
[03:53:00]  I think we live in a much different time  Than we once did  We also shouldn't feel entitled  To an answer on that stuff though  Like we forgive  But we are in no position  To forgive  Because it's not our business  It has nothing about it  Only stealing  Or taking funds  Or misusing public funds  You don't think  In turn  Blowing the president  In the Oval Office  Is a bit more  Than just none of our business  In a weird way  What  Unless you look at  The harassment issue  Of a workplace thing  Uh huh  But as far as  What he does  In his personal life  I don't care  Just because I know 
[03:53:30]  What JFK did  And I know how revered  He is and loved  In this country  Oh Mimi Beardsley  Yeah  And him and Bobby  Were both banging  Marilyn Monroe  And Bobby  Was a great attorney general  And a great man  And who cares  It means nothing to me  As long as I'm not  Fucking with kids  Or as long as I'm not  Hurting anybody  Like you know what I mean  Then I don't care  I think it's two points here though  I kind of agree  With what Jimmy's saying  But the guy kind of  Just lied  Yeah  When we asked him  Are you done with this  Because if you're done with this  We're cool too  And he said yeah  I'm done with this  And it turned out  He wasn't  I'm talking about Anthony Weiner  Yeah  Yeah  But why do we care 
[03:54:00]  And like this is my question  I'm just saying  It's two different issues  I see what you're saying  But it's tough to  The guy just openly  Continued lying to us  And finding weird  Just random people  On the internet  You haven't learned  Your lesson the first time  Oh my god  Find someone you know  In your life  Or something like that  That won't blab  The Carlos Danger name  Worked very well for him  Really a good cover  But it's sad that  His whole career  Got blown up  And he didn't even  Get the pussy  Yeah  Your mom's still listening  Sorry  She's probably not listening  She tuned out  Sorry mommy 
[03:54:30]  Sorry Cindy  Know what the best part  Of this love thing is  One half hour  Of the Sam Roberts  After show gone  I think my brother  Knows someone in your family  Why make it a negative thing  Are you going over time  Are we going over time  Yeah we're doing this  On purpose  Sorry  Why does it really make it hurt  Why does it get negative  All of a sudden  Everybody's having a good time  So Sam gets to come on  And go hey  It's Sam Roberts  Time to show up  You hate Steven Singer  Yeah  That's not what my voice sounds like  Alright well that's it  Ron and Fezz are coming up next  We'll see you tomorrow  I love Ron and Fezz  Oh yeah  You're so funny 
[03:55:00]  That's not what my voice sounds like  Oh you listen to this  She listens  I do  That's pretty cool  I have serious in my car  I love entertaining radio  And there's nothing worse  In the world than shitty radio  Oh yeah  And there's nothing worse  Than a shitty radio interview  There's a special kind of torture  Attached to shitty local radio interviews  What makes a bad interview for you  Because I've been interviewed  Many times terribly  People that just aren't engaged  On any level  Having a conversation whatsoever  And people that  I have been asked  Such offensive questions to 
[03:55:30]  And I'm not easily offended  What's an offensive question to you  I had a guy  And it was in  Albany New York  When I called in for my book  With Mike Lee and Black  And he was like  What's sex with a Republican like  Like a senator's daughter  What's sex with a senator's like  And I'm like  I'm not answering  This is really like  Offensive and disgusting  And he was like  You know what  I heard you were cool  And you're not cool  And then they hung up  And I was like  I guess I'll go fuck myself  Excuse me  Have fun in Albany  Sorry  You're supposed to do  I know  It's just like terrible  And then I have done ones recently  They're just bored 
[03:56:00]  They're just bored with me  Bored with talking  I can't see anyone  Being bored with you  We've had some people  That's like pulling teeth  Who?  Here we go again  Because we end up  Forgetting them  I love  I love a shitty interview story  Who are some other ones?  I'll tell you  Why can't we remember  The bad ones?  I felt tension with a few  I'll tell you  Who I felt tension with  Because he thought  I was fucking with him  But I really wasn't  Casey Elwes  The guy from Princess Bride  Yeah, Elwes  Yeah, I thought  We were going to get  And the guy from Princess Bride  Yeah, but it turned out 
[03:56:30]  To be okay  But I thought  We were going to get into it  Oh, what's his name?  The one that was in here  That you were going to work with  That he ended up  Calling you  What's his name?  The fucking sergeant  From Saving Private Ryan  Tom Sizemore  Tom Sizemore  I had a very weird  Wasn't he an addict though?  Yeah, he's really weird  I watched his show on VH1  Because I'm trash  How amazing was that?  Love train wrecks  Letting them film  Shit like that  Well, Dr. Drew  Is a twisted fuck  We all know that  I don't know how I feel  About Dr. Drew anymore  I used to really like him  And now  All those people keep dying 
[03:57:00]  Yeah  It's terrible  It's awful  Yeah  It's true  Well, that's what  Has creeped us out  Has anybody ever hit on you?  Any of you  When they were doing  A radio interview?  Oh, in the old days  All the fucking time  I used to be a fucking looker  Cordy Love  Fletcher  Cordy Love tweaked  Our nipples recently  Yeah  Like through your shirt?  Yeah, through my shirt  Yeah, I don't like  I love my nipples  Jimmy loves nipple play  I don't like nipple play  You love nipple play?  Yeah, but not harsh 
[03:57:30]  I think it just looks weird  Lightly touched  I'm very jaded, Megan  There's only a few points  In my body  That I haven't  I haven't  Beaten to death  And then  My nipples are still  Uncharted waters  I think it just looks weird  When  Yeah  When you're tweaking  Someone's nipples  It just looks stupid  Heidi Klum gave him  A tweak one time too  Did you ask her to?  Star studded  And me and Anthony  Could have went home  With Veruca salt  That's right  Oh God  I don't know who that is  I'm sorry  That's why I did it  Is that from Willy Wonka?  Old 90s band  Yeah, isn't that Willy Wonka?  It's some alt rock 
[03:58:00]  Oh, right on  It was an alt rock band  Girls  Anybody come in drunk?  That's good too  Cause this is  It's only Ish in the morning  Other than you assholes  I'm sure we had a couple  I thought  Probably George Witt  George Witt smelled like booze  I get me wrong  If I remember correctly  I'm thinking it was him  That's a really good question  We had Jim Jefferies  Come in here  Fucked  Jim Jefferies drunk  He's a comedian  He's a funny guy  Oh, did he come in  Fucked up  He was like on ecstasy  He was pilled out of his mind 
[03:58:30]  Yeah  Was he a good interviewer?  Booze  Yeah, Jim's right  It was always great  She started making  A fucking penthouse girl  Cry or something  Yeah, that's the interview  That he said  He wanted to  Pull the shit out of her ass  With a knife  What in the hell?  Oh, he was getting  Justine Jolie  I apologize  Cindy might still be listening  What in the hell?  He was drunk  Have we had anybody drunk?  Well, the Ed Asner interview  Was terrific  I liked that one a lot  That was really uncomfortable  In California  And I like Ed Asner  As does everyone 
[03:59:00]  Anthony's playing poker  I like Ed Asner too  I'm a big Ed Asner fan  Tremendous  And Opie and I  Are doing the show  With Joe Rogan  And Ant's playing poker  At a tournament  And Ed Asner sat down with us  We couldn't believe we got him  And we were talking to him  For a while  Well, I was making fun  Of the fact that  He was the first guy  Out in a poker tournament  And he didn't appreciate that  And it wasn't even that bad  So right off the bat  He was like grumpy  I just had to remember  Do you guys have like assholes  Coming up to you in person  Like listening to the show  The question is 
[03:59:30]  When don't we  All the time  That'll happen  It's called management  All the time?  No, I'm just kidding  So one of the guys  Makes some hand gestures  And Ed had to ask  What that meant  And I said  Well, that is  You know  A sign we do  When the guest is really boring  And it's our way  It's our way  To kind of wrap up  The interview  Oh my god  And then he said  He will never come on our show again  And blah, blah, blah  He said go fuck yourself  Ed Asner told you to go fuck yourself  Oh yeah, I love that  He did that  I kind of love that too 
[04:00:00]  I love that he did that  He still got it  Got some fire love  But afterwards  I went and got a big hug  From Ed Asner  A big bear hug  Yeah, he gave me a big hug  Big furry bear hug  There have been a handful  You were nude  There have been a handful  That Opie and Anthony  Have decided at the last minute  They don't want to do  So me and another guy  E-Rock  Have to sit in here  And pretend to be  Oh yeah  We franchised out the show  While our guest comes in  We've become big stars  Yeah, they know  We can do things like this  We know they don't know  What we look like  So we just tell them guys  Think the key's opening it 
[04:00:30]  Yeah, yeah  I think I'm Anthony  We've done it a few times  David Tyree from the Giants  Said you guys are Opie  And Anthony  You guys are legends  And we were like yeah  And he was like  You look really young  I know  And we were just watching  From another room  No, we were asking questions  As listeners from the other room  Right  To really make it uncomfortable  Why didn't you want  To interview them  We wanted to go home  It was the guy that made  The big Superbowl catch  Years ago  And he wrote a book  About the catch call  That was more than a catch  And it wasn't  And it wasn't  Did you see Thor  Or the Avengers 
[04:01:00]  No, should I?  Yeah, it was like  The biggest movie of the summer  And the guy who played Loki  Yeah  He's like the villain in the movie  Okay  They decided five minutes  Before he was coming in  Since they hadn't seen  The Avengers  They didn't want to do it  So  So you just did it?  Yeah  I would know  I mean  And then I know  What you guys look like  Yeah  I mean  It's like, you know  One that's certainly  In the political world  Ben Stein  Oh, that one  That's a big one  That went bad  Fuck Ben Stein  Really?  It was a fawner 
[04:01:30]  Cindy, I hope you're not hearing this  But fuck Ben Stein  Phone call with Ben Stein  I was doing a commercial  And he was on hold  We were going to pick him up  After the commercial breaks  Are over  Wait, we can play it  You have it?  Yeah, let's play  It's quick  It's quick what happened  It's less than a minute  It'll be better than  Now we've got to say hi to Ben Stein, Anthony  Ben Stein  Hey, Ben  Hi, how are you?  There he is  Did I just hear you do an ad  Where you said somebody  Was going to  Jew down the price of a car?  No, he said  Chew down  You just said  Jew down  Oh, that's a lot different 
[04:02:00]  We wouldn't say  Jew down on a commercial  We would say it during the show  I see  But not during a paid advertisement, Ben  Okay  And you being of Jewish background  I would take it, Ben  Yeah, of course  And if we were going to say something like that  We certainly wouldn't say it just before we talked to Ben Stein  Talked to Ben Stein  I see  You sure fooled me  Oh my God  Are we going to get off on a bad foot with Ben Stein right from the start?  Well, I really think that's a jackass thing to do  But we said chew down 
[04:02:30]  Well, it sounds just like Jew down  Oh my God  Well, I mean, come on  That's a crappy thing to do  That's just an absolutely explicit invitation to racism  Well, it's a term that is used  Chew  Not Jew  I wouldn't have said Jew down  Oh, man  Chew down  You know, you'd say like a beaver  Would go at a tree  He would chew down the tree  Well, it sounds just like Jew down  And anybody who's listening to it  Is going to know  You're saying Jew down 
[04:03:00]  With a tiny, tiny change  And the act that they fell like Jew down  Oh my God  Are you this insane?  Are you actually this insanely crazy?  That you're arguing over chew or Jew down?  Hello, Ben?  I think he just hung up  Ben Stein just hung up  Oh, shit, man  She was pissed  What a friggin' lunatic  Oh, man  That's a stretch  Tommy Lee interview?  Oh, Tommy Lee went bad, too 
[04:03:30]  I just remember what I think the most awkward interview was  Wow  I think it was Kristen Bell  On the phone  Really?  Oh, Kristen Bell, too  Can we play that for  I don't know  Do we have time to play the entire thing?  Oh, God  She makes me so happy  You want to hear a bad interview?  I want to hear every bad awkward interview  And I would  I would blame the hosts on this one  Oh, yeah  That one's pretty  I mean, that was a good one  This is a quick one, Ben  Really quick  I know  We've got to interrupt this news story 
[04:04:00]  We've got a big star on the phone  Kristen Bell, the star of Forgetting Sarah Marshall  Kristen  Yes?  Congratulations on the new movie  Are you excited?  I'm so excited  Awesome  Wait, why did that happen?  Because Opie didn't want to interview her  Because we were in the middle of a lot of important stuff  You hung up on her?  Yes, Opie hung up on her  You hung up on Kristen Bell?  She's like a huge movie star 
[04:04:30]  Yeah, that's what's great about that  Awesome  You should have seen Roland panicking after you  Oh, he lost his mind  You can't hang up on someone that's sort of a movie star  If you're going to do it, you've got to do it, right?  Was she pissed?  Oh, we never heard from her again  Never heard from her again  Actually, we like her, of course  And she was great in that movie  And blah, blah, blah  But it was just one of those things  Linda Blair, too  We've got to go on  Yeah  We called up Linda Blair  Wow, she's got us thinking here  Yeah  Megan McCain  I like it  Linda Blair, we just recited  We just yelled into the phone 
[04:05:00]  The power of Christ compels you  And she's like, all right, guys  That was fine  But we didn't stop  It went on for five minutes  We just wouldn't stop  She eventually just hung up, right?  She hung up  And then our guy there at the Comic-Con that she was at  Took a while to talk her back into calling back in  Saying they were just fucking around  Saying they were just fucking around  She called up  She goes, hello?  The power of Christ compels  Again, we wouldn't stop  She was very angry  And Travis is reminding me of Amanda Peet  What did  I forgot 
[04:05:30]  Amanda Peet?  You guys were looking at photos of her online  Oh, Opie said something about  What?  Were you, like, gross?  I think he said something about her chest  He said something like  I see a little problem  No, now she doesn't like me  No, what did you say?  She's liked us until now  No, I  What did you say?  I think he said  I really don't remember  I think I was making fun of her  Were you complimenting her?  No  You know how  It's kind of a bit where  You have a really  You know, hot girl in the studio  Or whatever  And then you try to find that one  Tiny 
[04:06:00]  That she just obsesses about  Her entire life  It's terrible to do  You asshole  Is that how you pick up  Is that how you pick up chicks?  That's a  It's called a neg  It's a stupid dating tactic  A neg  Is it really?  Yeah  I didn't even know  It was in the game  It's in the game, yes  It just works out for a radio  See, you know  You, like, insult a woman  To make her insecure  And then she'll be in you  That  Men of America  Never works on me  I'm like  Go fuck yourself  Throw a drink on you  No, it was just  The tiniest, stupidest 
[04:06:30]  Oh, whatever  And then she freaked out?  I don't know  She was  You have it?  How long is this?  It's about two minutes  But it starts off  I don't remember  What about  Play it if you want  There was also  Bobby Brady  What did we do to Bobby Brady?  From the Brady Bunch?  Yeah, Aunt wouldn't stop  Humming Brady Bunch songs  Brady Bunch songs  Threw a fastball at his head  Threw a ball at my head  Like a baseball?  Yes  That was just too  And then when we got  Meadow Soprano crying  Oh, you assholes 
[04:07:00]  No, we turned the mics off  For that  She cried?  I forgot why  That one was not our fault  And we did the right thing  That day  And I actually got a  I forget now  It was probably an email  From her father  Thanking us for being cool  Good  Because she wasn't  Because she wasn't  A huge star yet  It was early on  In the Sopranos  Did she make fun of her?  And she  No, we didn't  I swear  It was in the news  I forgot what it was  There was something in the news  About some eating disorder stuff  With her  So we brought it up  Without goofing on her  Or anything  Not to make her  You know  We thought she was ready 
[04:07:30]  To talk about it  And I guess  She was not ready  She just started crying  Has anybody else ever cried  Oh man  We almost had Sugar Ray Leonard cry  Almost  But then Anthony  Couldn't handle the emotional moment  We were having  And fucking blew it up  That's okay  You're fine  Me and Jimmy  Looked at each other  Wide-eyed  Like oh my god  We're gonna have this  Ex-champion  Fucking crying in a minute  We had a midget stripper  Girl  We gotta stop this  It'll be in our book  Well a girl  She was a midget  And she called in  And said she wanted to audition  Because she wanted to be a stripper  And we were like 
[04:08:00]  Well come in  We'll let you know  If you got what it takes  So she came in  Took her clothes off  Got on the console  Like one of these type of consoles  Can I just interrupt this  On this console?  I don't know  It was an old studio  It was an old studio  About ten studios ago  Similar  But Tom Hanks' son was in that day  Yeah yeah  Colin Hanks and Jack Black  And Jack Black were part of this one  And Patrice O'Neill I believe  She got up there  And started dancing  And I don't know  I guess some of the people  Were commenting or chuckling  And she just burst into tears  And covered up her naughty portion 
[04:08:30]  There was a naked midget  Crying  It was sad  That was one of those shows  Where you leave to get your car  After the show's over  And the mics are off  It's not fun and games anymore  And you're just like  I'm just a horrid person  What am I doing with my life?  Yeah yeah  What am I doing?  In our defense  We weren't trying to make her cry  No  We really weren't  No  Well  That's pretty good  At least they didn't have very far to go  Pretty good  Yeah  I like that  Some sweet stories right there
