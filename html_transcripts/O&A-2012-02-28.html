<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opened with the hosts – Opie, Anthony, and Jim Norton – introducing themselves with characteristic self-deprecating and provocative humor, referencing past FCC troubles and show suspensions.  The conversation immediately veered into a discussion of a school shooting near Cleveland, Ohio, speculating on the perpetrator's motivations, which reportedly included a perceived slight by an ex-girlfriend.  The hosts then shared graphic and offensive anecdotes about their own high school experiences, detailing instances of bullying, often focusing on physical appearance and social awkwardness.

This transitioned into a discussion of the Daytona 500, specifically Pablo Montoya's crash and the subsequent delay.  They discussed Montoya's reaction, and a driver who gained Twitter followers by tweeting race pictures during the delay.  The NBA All-Star game and the Oscars were briefly mentioned, noting the latter's higher ratings.  The hosts then compared the Instagram accounts of Roland (criticized for repetitive NYC skyline photos) and Bob Kelly (praised for more artistic content).  The segment concluded with brief mentions of a sex shop fire and a disturbing medical case from TLC. Throughout this section, the hosts used offensive language and engaged in frequent tangents.

The next segment began with a graphic description of conjoined twins, referencing a “Medical Anomalies” YouTube video. This segued into a rant about Western Union's poor customer service.  The anniversary of U2's "War" album and the final *MASH* episode prompted discussion of the band and show, followed by a critique of a song from *Alice Doesn't Live Here Anymore*.  A segment of listener "F.U.'s" followed, expressing anger towards various individuals and entities. An off-color joke from "Uncle Paul" was interjected before a discussion of a death resulting from another school shooting.

A lengthy interview with an Australian man who owned a Kings Cross sex shop followed, detailing a fire at his establishment, including explicit descriptions of its services and clientele, and accusing a competitor of arson.  The hosts then played a recording of a radio show where a jazz musician unknowingly broadcast a gay pornographic video, discussing the lack of apology and a subsequent discussion about a potentially homophobic co-worker’s use of the pronoun "she" when referring to a male colleague who had recently come out. This led to a debate on workplace tolerance. A caller from Fresno criticized the show’s content, prompting further discussion of its explicit nature. The segment concluded with a Black History Month tribute to Al Sharpton, a comedic reading from the "book of Ted," and a "Masturbation Memories" segment with Jim Jeffries.  Laszlo, a recurring guest, was in studio, sharing anecdotes and discussing Patrice O'Neal's funeral.  Several celebrity names, including Brian Cox, Chaz Palminteri, Danny McBride, and David DeLuise, were mentioned.

A later segment focused on a caller's trip to Greece and Turkey, the global economy, and the Greek debt crisis.  The caller's stock portfolio losses were discussed, alongside a humorous anecdote about a successful bet against the Euro. The hosts joked about their own past financial misadventures.  Laszlo shared a story about working on *Max Payne 3* in Sao Paulo, highlighting the stark contrast between wealth and poverty and the security concerns.  Discussions about US manufacturing jobs, union issues, and economic systems ensued.  A comedic interlude featuring a Radio Shack employee offering technical support preceded a discussion about the hosts' plans to leave satellite radio for traditional radio, citing frustrations with restrictions and lack of creative freedom.  Laszlo recounted an embarrassing encounter with Don Imus.

Another segment heavily featured a rejected radio bit involving women defecating into bags for a contest. The hosts debated the legality and feasibility with their producer, "Useless," who relayed lawyer concerns about obscenity charges.  They brainstormed alternative segments for an upcoming Cleveland broadcast, such as a Dunkin' Donuts Munchkin juggling contest.  The hosts expressed frustrations with their management, particularly "Eric," criticizing interference with creative freedom.  Other topics included Kid Rock's political endorsements, the attractiveness of a *Smash* actress, the *Dancing With The Stars* cast (with offensive comments about contestants' appearances), a listener defending Gavin DeGraw, and a detailed discussion of pornography featuring a former *Family Matters* child actress.  Laszlo, a video game developer, was again a studio guest, discussing his work.

A final segment focused on increasingly absurd variations of the defecation radio bit, including a "Cleveland Steamer" contest. This involved discussions about necessary corporate emails to pitch the idea and further discussions on Laszlo's travel experiences, Roland's Instagram, professional wrestling storylines (with Eric's inaccurate criticisms), workplace dynamics with Eric, and bullying in high school. Chip Chipperson (or possibly Peppy Sinclair) was mentioned, along with Dr. Gay, Jim Abbott, Kerry Marshall, Rachel Dratch, Captain Parnell, Chad Dukes, Joe Vila, and unnamed interns.  Several listeners called in with suggestions and comments.  A phone call from someone identifying themselves as John from WWE was also briefly mentioned.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  New York City, 6 a.m.  An out-of-control satellite radio show is being broadcasted to millions of Americans.  At the controls, Reg Hughes, a father.  I am amazed it lasted this long.  Anthony Cumia, an alcoholic.  Holy mother of God.  And Jim Norton, a comedian.  There's no positives out of this thing, except for everybody's blood.  The three men make up The Opie and Anthony Show,  a popular radio program known for its cringe style of entertainment and having very few limits.  Oh, my God. 
[00:00:30]  Okay, no, this is getting really intense now.  It starts funny and it gets very uncomfortable.  In the past, they have been accused of multiple FCC violations  and have even gotten their show suspended from satellite radio.  You couldn't have picked a fucking more self-destructive show.  You get the crazier, the better.  What, you're 19?  I'm 19.  Delicious.  You made Springer uncomfortable.  Do you know how hard that is to do?  Thank God this show's on radio.  Everything you are about to hear is real.  Real people, real excitement.  Hey, let's go, fuck.  I have a good time.  What the fuck?  Get ready to experience the thrill of a lifetime. 
[00:01:00]  This is The Opie and Anthony Show.  Just sit back and enjoy the show.  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road.  Let's do it.  Good morning, everybody.  Good morning.  Good morning.  Good morning, everybody.  Good morning.  Good morning.  Good morning.  Good morning.  I had that clip.  Ah.  I don't have it anymore, though.  Yeah, I don't know where it's going.  I got this.  So, isn't this great?  So.  And I got this. 
[00:01:30]  So.  I got this one, too.  Okay, okay.  Save it for the feel.  It's time to rock.  Okay, time to rock.  Save it for the feel.  It's time to rock.  What is that?  That's from the Grammys.  Okay, okay.  Save it for the feel.  It's time to rock.  That's Manningham.  It's time to rock.  Looking real stiff up there.  Oh, isn't this great?  Oh, isn't this great?  Oh.  How awful is he? 
[00:02:00]  He rules.  I first remember that guy.  This is when I was drinking.  My friend was Jamaican.  His name was Devon.  And he hated that guy so much.  See, why?  He would just talk about that and do that all the time.  He would just go, isn't this great?  That Jamaican guy would mock him.  I fucking hate him.  Terrible, actually.  He's so hateable.  He's more like Ted.  Got a school shooting.  Top of the news today.  30 miles outside Cleveland, by the way.  Yes, it was over my tickets. 
[00:02:30]  Oh.  It was over your tickets.  They were just scrambling around, huh?  Some kid got tickets.  Another kid wanted them.  That's what happens.  Tragic.  God, I hope the school shootings don't come back.  Oh, my God.  This looked like a guy was a little pissed off.  Another guy was wheeling out with his chick, his ex-girlfriend.  Oh, really?  Well, the news is saying it's cyberbullying.  Well, were they saying it's cyberbullying or just bullying?  Or bullying.  It's all under the same umbrella.  The news just goes to their flow chart.  And if they don't understand something, they go, oh, bullying. 
[00:03:00]  Cyberbullying.  Bullying.  Cyberbullying.  This is what caused this.  I don't know.  Do you have more info?  There was a chick situation?  Yeah, there was some ex-girlfriend thing.  He walked into the cafeteria, and there was some guy and his ex-girlfriend.  Some guy was kind of hooked up, and that seems to have pissed him off.  He didn't even go to the school.  He was in another program for troubled youth.  Was he in the special building?  I think he was in the special building. 
[00:03:30]  My high school had the special building.  That trailer that they pulled up next to the real school?  Mine was, I think back in the day, it was a full high school.  And then as the years went by, I guess less kids went there.  So there was a section of Harborfields High School back in the day that no one really went to.  There was a hallway that kind of invisibly ended.  You know what I mean?  No one went there.  You would walk down the hallway, and then you knew not to walk any further.  And there was no fence up or anything.  But if you did walk further, it was where the, you know, meh. 
[00:04:00]  The forbidden zone.  The troublemakers.  It was the troublemakers, yes.  It wasn't slow kids or anything like that.  It was the troublemakers.  It was like some kind of BOCES program, I believe.  Yeah.  I had that happen to me in California.  Really?  I was booted out of.  And you had to go to the trailer?  Out of Dana Hills High School.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I had to go to.  Actually, I had to go to a whole other school.  Oh, wow.  Father Junipero Serra.  Father Junipero Serra High School. 
[00:04:30]  Why did you get kicked out?  I never heard the story.  Because I was just totally disinterested.  See, the school, Dana Hills, a very hoity-toity school.  Sure.  In Dana Point, California.  And they loved their track record of kids graduating and kids doing well and everything.  And the way they did this, see, was to take all the shitty students and throw them in a whole other school.  And ship them out. 
[00:05:00]  And then they could say.  So they didn't even give you a chance.  No.  No, no, no, no.  They didn't sit you down and go, look, man.  No sitting down.  No nothing.  Wow.  So what did it take?  A C or a couple days not showing up?  Yeah, I was a problem with attendance.  I'd always had that attendance problem.  It plagued me through my entire school career.  But in that school, they kind of pull you in and go, all right, here, we've got a great place for you.  You seem to have a different learning type. 
[00:05:30]  You're a different learner.  Right.  And I went to this school, which was like, it reminded me of the prison, the boys' prison from Bad Boys.  Okay.  With Sean Penn movie Bad Boys, not the Miami one.  And it was just people that went surfing during the afternoon.  They just handed out dittos, old dittos.  And you did your work and you could leave any time you want, man. 
[00:06:00]  Oh, really?  Oh, yeah, yeah.  As long as you finish your work, man.  So they looked at you as not fixable.  Right.  So it was like, why even fucking hassle this kid?  Let him do whatever the fuck he wants.  But didn't that bother you?  Because you're a learner.  No, as far as I was concerned, any type of school was just not good.  You didn't like learning?  I didn't like school learning.  I loved learning myself.  I built model rockets and things like that.  You should have been homeschooled. 
[00:06:30]  Yeah, I probably should.  Well, by my parents, I don't think so.  Homeschooled.  Here's a bottle of Budweiser.  True.  Open it.  Turn counterclockwise.  So you fucking got to go to the trailer school.  I went to that school.  The teachers also were just as bad as the students.  Like, they took the shitty teachers and put them in the shitty school.  Oh, really?  Yeah, the teachers that didn't want to do anything.  So they just sat there at this desk and handed out these dittos.  Their curriculum was just stacks of dittos. 
[00:07:00]  And you filled them out.  And they were literally fifth and sixth grade work dittos.  Why the fuck did I stress so much about school?  Exactly.  I could have went down this path.  I didn't even make it through that one.  Really?  No.  I couldn't deal.  I couldn't deal.  What, did they ship you back to the East Coast at that point?  At that point, I actually made the decision myself to go like, maybe I just ought to leave  the state and start fresh back in New York again and go to school there because I'm really 
[00:07:30]  not doing well here.  You think your mom was really bummed when she got that phone call?  Like, oh, man.  She was pleased as punch to have me back.  You think?  Oh, yeah.  She hated that I stayed out there.  She was very happy when she got the call.  Oh, yeah.  She got the old call, came back, and proceeded to screw up my school career here in New York,  too.  Kevin from Connecticut is calling it slow times at Ridgemont High.  Ah, well, you know.  Just chilling out.  It wasn't kids that were stupid or retarded or anything. 
[00:08:00]  It was kids that just couldn't fucking deal with going to school.  And then there was the troublemakers, the fighters, they'd put them in there, and the weirdos.  Right.  You know, the kids that fucking just kept their hood up all the time and fucking didn't look  at anybody.  So it was like prison.  It was.  It was like a little.  Like a mini prison.  Yeah.  Like a, I don't know, the minor leagues of prison.  Yep.  And it was all about weed. 
[00:08:30]  Oh, my God.  Every, like, you'd finish your dittos, and then before the next set of dittos came out,  you'd get to hang out on the lawn, man.  Because they didn't want any problems.  Scroovy.  They didn't want any problems, so they figured if everyone's just high, there won't be any  issues.  Yep.  And they didn't give anyone trouble about it.  You went out to the lawn, you sat down, man, and you just smoked weed, and then you  came back to the class all stoned.  We should do that here.  Yeah.  We wouldn't bitch as much. 
[00:09:00]  Smoke some weed.  After the first break, let's go outside and just smoke some weed.  Fucking smoke a fatty, you.  So this kid was in one of those type of situations, but he was, why was he in the regular high  school then yesterday?  I think he just came back.  He, like, walked in.  So that was his school originally, but they moved him on to another school?  That's what I heard.  And then he saw, like, in the cafeteria, his ex there with another guy?  Yeah, his ex with another guy.  But we've all been through that situation.  Oh, yeah. 
[00:09:30]  Some people handle it a little better than others.  Well, we don't pick up a fucking gun and then go to town.  Some people pick up a gun.  Some people handle it very sanely and try to break their arm with a baseball bat.  Oh, true.  Yeah, we've all done some crazy shit, but.  So he went into the school yesterday with the gun.  So he already knew the girl was.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Gotcha.  Gotcha.  So he went in there.  Did he shoot her or the new boyfriend?  I'm not sure who got shot.  There was four people injured, I believe.  Who got shot?  One dead, four injured, I believe.  Yeah, yeah.  And.  But they're kind of hinting at bullying and stuff. 
[00:10:00]  Saying he was, yeah, one of these social outcast kind of weirdos.  And yeah, he was a social outcast that had a girl problem.  Yeah.  That's a lot different than being bullied.  But you've never heard a jock come in and shoot everybody.  You've never heard of guys who like are friends with everybody.  It's always someone that gets beat up.  It's always someone that's an outcast and is getting the shit beat out of them.  Yeah.  Unless they're totally crazy.  It's always those guys.  Yeah.  Could they have to.  You know how much you have to hate people to walk in without a mask and just shoot everybody?  Yeah, that's true. 
[00:10:30]  I don't know, though.  I remember growing up also in school having those kids that would just get the fuck beat out of them every day.  It's just what happened.  Like now you go to a teacher or something and things are taken care of.  They, you know, zero tolerance.  But there was a kid, Patrick Fullen.  Wow.  Did he used to just get punched in the stomach every day?  I've talked about him.  He made a funny face when he got punched in the stomach.  So everybody punched him in the stomach to see his funny face.  What is he doing now, you think? 
[00:11:00]  I don't know.  We got to look up some of these people.  He's got to be in prison for something.  Why?  I don't know.  He was a problem?  No, but you can't go your whole school career being punched in the stomach.  Yeah, but some of those guys turn into MMA fighters or something.  They go the other way.  He was a little fat fuck.  Yeah, but deserved it.  You haven't seen some of these shows where they show the little fat fuck and then he comes out?  Yeah, that's true.  To, you know, confront the old bully guy and he's now ripped?  Yeah, that's true.  He could be ripped now.  And then there was Bellen Gornell. 
[00:11:30]  Bellen.  What an ugly name.  She stunk to high hell.  She smelt like fucking rotting cheese.  Her name was Bell?  Bellen.  Bellen, and she smelled?  That must have been a fucking field day.  It was so easy to just fuck with that pig.  Oh, everybody gave her shit and just threw things at her.  You'd just walk by her in the cafeteria and she was always just sitting alone at the table, hunched over her food. 
[00:12:00]  And, like, people would just walk by and, wham, just wing something at her.  She'd wince and then go back to eating and kick her fucking chair.  We'll shower, you fucking slob.  She was just minding her own business.  Yeah, I know.  Why didn't she shower?  I don't know.  She probably had a horrific home life of an abusive family and couldn't shower.  So she was probably just trying to survive the day.  I know.  And you guys made it worse.  Dude, I wasn't saying it was her fault.  Look, we're not.  You know, it's cruel fucking, you know, Lord of the Flies mentality in those schools. 
[00:12:30]  I'm not saying I was certainly a saint back then.  I don't really remember how awful we were, but you're just awful as a kid, right?  Yeah, the kids are terrible.  But the point today, you just nailed it.  That girl probably had the worst life ever at all.  And probably her safety was to be at school.  That was her high point.  And now you guys, unaware, because we're too young to be aware of anything.  Yeah, yeah.  Just making it worse for her.  People would walk by with the lunch tray and just, like, smack her on top of the head with it. 
[00:13:00]  Not like a crack fucking, you know.  Just enough to annoy her.  But just a clunk right on top of her head.  Or they'd go over in those little stupid pint containers of milk.  They would just tip it over on her.  Just runs out on the table.  I'm amazed there's not more.  School shootings.  Yeah, well, I'm amazed there weren't more when I was growing up.  Yeah, especially when we were growing up.  It's just cruel.  I knew a guy named Mark, and he was, like, kind of retarded.  Not retarded, but he was off. 
[00:13:30]  And he would eat his cheese.  When he ate his pizza, he would always scrape the cheese off it and eat it without the cheese.  He would never eat the cheese on his pizza.  Deserves a fist in the face for that one.  No, he hated when you'd come up and go, and when you'd blow in his face.  He went ballistic.  He would scratch his face and go, oh, stop bothering me!  You are bothering me!  What is he, Luke Costello?  Yeah, it was like that.  That's how he would see.  He would scratch his face. 
[00:14:00]  Oh, and he would make that noise.  Oh, shit.  You got to blow in the kid's face.  He hated it.  You have to.  Everyone blew in his face.  It was fan city.  If you're going to get a reaction like that, I think you have to blow in his face.  Dude, you couldn't not blow in his face.  Jeez, that's unbelievable.  Oh, then there was this girl, Jolie.  Jolie at Elwood Junior High, and she would just sit there.  She was fat, and it looked like her home life was probably hell, too, because her hair 
[00:14:30]  was very ratty and greasy, and she just looked like a frumpy mess, but she would sit there  in her chair and fucking put her heel up in the seat, sit on it, and rock back and forth  and just fucking masturbate all day in front of everybody.  You guys knew?  Oh, yeah.  No doubt.  Oh, yeah.  She would rock, just sit there on her heel. 
[00:15:00]  She pulled her heel right into her crotch.  Right.  And would just sit there and rock in her seat back and forth, back and forth, and she'd  be doing her, like, work and shit.  Was she hot besides the greasy hair?  No, she was horrible.  Wow, really?  Oh, she was, like, terrible.  Please tell me you left her alone.  No, people fucked with her, too.  Why would you fuck with that?  I don't know.  Even an ugly girl masturbating is pretty hot.  Yeah, but it was, I don't know.  It wasn't hot with her because growing up, she was too fucking homely. 
[00:15:30]  How is that not hot?  When your hormones are starting to figure it shit out, you're looking at a 60-year-old  teacher and getting turned on.  No, she was a pig, and she had, like, a fish face thing going, where she was fat and, like,  fucking, but she just sat there and rocked on her heel.  Where is she today?  I don't know.  Doing porno.  Doing interracial pornography.  Doing fat cam shows.  Yeah, fat cam shows. 
[00:16:00]  Fat girl cam shows.  They were all, but boy, let me tell you, I don't remember many of the standout students.  I remember the fucking weirdos and freaks.  But, uh, yeah.  We had a kid that was a little chubby kid.  I forgot his name.  Eric?  He was like the Doogie Howser of our fucking school.  He was literally 12 in high school.  One of those?  And instead of, like, treating him, like, with low respect, like, holy fuck, you're  12 doing what we're doing.  Yeah.  He might have even been younger at the time. 
[00:16:30]  And they would just fucking abuse him.  Yeah.  So here's a kid, he's not even developed.  He doesn't even have the maturity level of his classmates.  And, you know, they would knock the books out of his hand and stuff, because they were  so pissed that he was such a bookworm and a smart kid.  Kids are fucked.  Like, why wouldn't you just show a little respect for a 12-year-old in your high school?  Pretty good there.  Doing good.  You know, he wasn't one of these kids that, you know, graduate fucking Harvard at 11.  But he was, like, 12, and we were, you know, 17, 18. 
[00:17:00]  I believe he graduated at 12.  Wow.  Yeah.  But we had to make his life a living out now.  No, you have to.  Or people did, certainly.  No, you have to.  We had a midget, too.  You had a midget?  Yeah, you see that midget walking around the hall.  God, you were lucky.  He wound up being, he wound up working, like, at the White House or something.  He just recently died.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  You talked about that.  Yeah, yeah, that guy.  Where are you doing?  I don't know.  You trim under the hedges?  On the Bigelow West water.  It's a table stand.  One of the guys who lived, when I, remember the story I tell about kicking a ball of shit 
[00:17:30]  out of my leg?  Of course.  That happened at my buddy Bill D'Angelo's house.  And, like, a few houses down across the street, there was a gigantic yard with a little teeny house.  It was the poor people on the block, it was the poor people on the block, and it smelled, and there was always, like, dog shit on the bed.  It was, like, one of those places.  Oh, God.  And he was bullied.  The kid, Robert, was bullied.  And his younger brother was bullied, too.  And he, I think, attacked a bully or something with a lighter and a fucking hairspray. 
[00:18:00]  Right.  He set somebody on fire.  Damn.  And then the mother eventually committed suicide.  Jesus.  Yeah, it was terrible.  Raising fucking disasters like that.  Can't clean the house.  I remember going to the house, and he was a nice guy, but he was just an outcast.  And I went to his house, and his mother would buy, like, a lot of potato chips and stuff like that.  They were fun.  I didn't even realize that.  I didn't say that back then.  I just hate them. 
[00:18:30]  I just didn't.  I didn't say that back then.  And then there was always the terminally ill student.  Do you have any of those?  I don't think so.  Because we had a couple of those throughout school and never understood it.  You know why?  Because they never graduated.  They always dropped dead before the graduation.  And you're like, why are you wasting your time in school?  Wow, you had one of those.  And why are you depressing everybody?  Wow.  Fuck. 
[00:19:00]  We had black girls that passed out.  Two of them.  What?  They would pass out during class.  For what?  I don't know.  Maybe I go in.  It was a little early.  Maybe I'm thinking they were pregnant or something.  Oh, Jesus.  We had two of them.  Yeah.  That's kind of scary when all of a sudden they fucking hit the ground.  Yeah.  I don't know why they passed out.  We had two of those.  You had two in Harborfields?  Oh, yeah.  And then we had one of those girls.  Now it's all coming back to me.  That was ridiculously twisted in a wheelchair.  Oh, wow.  Like, literally, almost like a, is it Stephen Hawking? 
[00:19:30]  Oh, man.  Yeah.  Just like.  I always fucked that up.  Stephen Hawking.  Hawking.  Stephen Hawking, yeah.  Hawking.  She had kind of that shit going on where she only had a couple muscles working.  And I used to remember as a kid going, why fucking bother, man?  Yeah.  What are you doing?  And everything was a complete pain in the ass.  And she would be in the cafeteria trying to eat.  And I remember we used to make fun of her.  And most of her lunch would end up on her because she just.  Oh, God.  But all she's trying.  And now you look back, like, all this poor thing is trying to get some nourishment. 
[00:20:00]  Just trying to eat.  Just trying to eat.  But we thought it was hilarious that half her fucking lunch every day ended up on her.  And then there was a nice teacher that had to clean her up.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  And we were just assholes.  Like, looking back now, I wouldn't want to make fun of that shit.  Kids are horrible.  Why would you?  Yeah.  What does that get you?  All she wanted was to try to fit in a little bit.  Obviously, she had some kind of brain.  I think I remember she did really well.  But the problem was she was so fucking twisted in this wheelchair.  Total lack of compassion is what it is when you're a kid. 
[00:20:30]  There's not that.  You don't have that ability to look at somebody.  Why is that?  And think like, hey, that person.  Let me think for three seconds what it must be like to be that person.  Or think what it must be like to be not right here, to be at home, to, you know, maybe their fucking parents are assholes and shit like that.  That goes right down the shitter.  I think a lot of it is peer pressure, too, because you're with your friends and, you know, you want to be the guy that fucking raps somebody in the head.  I don't think it is peer pressure because I go to a lot of the city parks with my son. 
[00:21:00]  It's already starting.  Yeah.  They push each other over.  Or they will run up to my son and just, like, start making faces and scream in his face and then run away.  Like, the craziest, weirdest, passive-aggressive shit, and it's starting at two, three years old.  They don't understand consequences.  Yeah.  Is that what that is?  They have no ability to process what will happen and the consequences.  They don't understand any impact.  Because the baby needs to play truth or consequences.  What year do you get some of that shit in your brain? 
[00:21:30]  Because now we're talking about two or three-year-olds, what I'm seeing right now, and I remember what we did in high school.  I guess after you've had enough experience yourself with consequence, you know, in school, it's like, what's the worst that's going to happen?  And you would get fucking, hey, knock that off over there.  The teacher, like, the look the other way teachers, hey, knock it off over there.  Okay.  And then they walk away and you go right back to what you were doing.  You're probably right about the peer pressure thing.  Yeah, there's an element of that.  Because the peer pressure thing ends, even in college, I didn't feel the peer pressure as much. 
[00:22:00]  But in high school, yeah, everyone wants to fit into some kind of group.  And if you're in that group, then you want to fucking make fun of whatever you can, I guess, around you.  Yeah, if you were the one that wasn't in a group, you're fucked.  It's typical fucking breakfast club mentality.  Yeah, that's why that movie was so great.  You can't show compassion or feeling for some weirdo, or else you're going to be lumped in the weirdo category.  So in order to make yourself look better, you've got to treat them like shit.  Wouldn't the cool kids be the ones that kind of show some respect for these? 
[00:22:30]  No, cool kids.  How do you think they've got to be cool kids?  I'm just thinking in the universe, though.  Wouldn't those actually be the cool kids that go, well, fuck peer pressure and this shit?  You would think.  You would think, right?  But no.  You brought up the black people in your school?  I had like three in my school growing up.  There were probably three.  One guy, two girls.  And one of the girls, and you know I'm not very into the interracial thing.  I'm not very attracted to black women. 
[00:23:00]  I'm just not.  I like whitey.  Paler the better.  But there was this one black chick, and she had really big lips, too.  And all I imagined was her giving me a blowjob.  That was like every morning I'd be by the bathroom because that's where everyone kind of smoked.  And she was over there.  And I'd always look at her going, God.  And it would get me excited.  I'd think like, oh.  So you would have.  You would have allowed this. 
[00:23:30]  I don't know if I would have gone the distance.  You would have allowed it back then.  The fantasy was good enough.  I just thought about what that would look like.  You know?  Big fucking.  You never had a black girl blow you or anything?  No!  All right.  Relax.  What do you think I am?  A queer?  A lot of black chicks are very sexy.  I prefer white girls and Spanish girls.  It's just what I like.  But man, I've had some reminders.  Watch out for those Spanish girls. 
[00:24:00]  Black chicks are fucking sexy, man.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Don't fucking shake it, man.  It has to be a real, like this one.  Let me see.  Oh, Jesus.  Kind of like her.  Yeah.  This woman was very, very short.  She has a hairdo.  She's black maud.  Why is she walking like that?  Why is she walking like that?  I know.  What the fuck?  Man, she must have got a good one last night.  Awful sweater and a fucking short, old.  She has a haircut like a white man in the 50s.  That's a terrible, terrible hairdo for a black woman. 
[00:24:30]  She's got either bad hips or she had a really good night.  Yeah.  A little arthritis or she got a high, hard one.  So it goes back to the Ohio school shooting.  They're showing the kids' face on every fucking channel.  What's this blurry picture?  They can't get a better picture.  Victim need to reach out and talk.  Victims need to reach out and talk.  Yeah.  And I'll tell you another reason we're seeing more school shootings.  Yeah.  Because.  Well, we haven't seen school shootings lately.  Well.  But it seems like it might start coming back, though.  In our lifetimes.  Yeah. 
[00:25:00]  In the last 10 years.  Right.  Because they give them celebrity status.  No, they do.  And they also read the manifestos, these little pieces of shit, right?  And they give them this horrifying, like, whoa, this guy was scary.  Notorious.  Yeah.  They make you notorious.  And that's what these guys want.  Instead of just making them.  They shouldn't even name them.  They shouldn't show their picture.  Right.  Because the ones who want to do it for the fame, you just, you talked about like you're  a little worm and nobody knows who you are.  Yeah. 
[00:25:30]  You go from being that dummy walking around that got picked on to all of a sudden now  you're this evil person lumped in with other evil people through history.  Evil.  Evil.  Evil.  Evil.  Evil.  And there's a power in that.  Yeah.  Definitely.  It was five kids shot.  One dead and four injured.  Damn.  They're calling them a bullied outcast.  I would suggest the mainstream media looks a little deeper into the story instead of  just fucking labeling everything a bullying incident. 
[00:26:00]  You need that label.  Yep.  You need the old label put on there.  The news loves a good label.  Absolutely.  Daytona 500, huh?  That was entertaining.  A little explosion there.  All I know about the Daytona 500, my brother, Brett, who owns FH Riley, is in the heart of  Huntington Village.  He's a huge race car fan.  Loves fucking, loves NASCAR.  And he couldn't wait to watch it on Sunday.  Yeah.  And then what happened?  There was a rain delay. 
[00:26:30]  Rain out.  Yeah.  I'm not going to make believe I know fucking NASCAR.  I've watched with my brother and he makes it interesting because he'll point out shit  and I go, oh, okay.  So they had the rain delay and then what?  It was supposed to happen yesterday?  Uh, well, they, uh, they had a cancellation.  They, well, well, a postponement.  Until Monday.  Yeah.  And then they had it, uh.  But it looks like they did it at night.  Last night.  Why at night?  Oh, there's plenty of lights.  Yeah, but all those people would probably want it during the day. 
[00:27:00]  Why?  Why not?  You're down there waiting.  I don't know.  People drive from all over the country.  So now they're just waiting around.  Why not have it during the day?  Under the lights.  Does anyone know why it was at night?  Was it, I know there was the, there was a two hour delay.  Well, that was because of the little accident.  There was one accident.  Then there was the other accident when, uh, uh, uh, a car rammed into the other car that  was, uh, drying the track.  Here comes Traps to save my ass.  What do you know about the Daytona 500?  Oh, there's cars that go roundy round. 
[00:27:30]  You want to know why it was at night?  Yeah.  Because it was supposed to be at noon, but it was still raining, so they had to reschedule  it again for seven o'clock.  I guess they wanted to schedule it so far, you know, away from possible rain that that's  why it started at seven.  And then the race starts and there was a crash taking out Danica and Jimmy Johnson, I think,  right?  I think.  Jimmy Johnson was taken out in that fucking crash?  There's five people in the studio that didn't watch any of the race, but that's what  the thing happened.  I always thought her name was Danica Kirkpatrick. 
[00:28:00]  I didn't realize it was Danica.  Danica Kirkpatrick.  I didn't know it was Danica.  But then this, uh, this thing, yeah, this is, this was amazing.  It's out of the frame here.  He hits the back of one of the, uh, jet-dry trucks.  Oh!  Oh, I see.  And jet fuel just, uh, bursts into flames.  See the safety trucks up top?  They got safety trucks trying to dry out the track.  Who was the driver that crashed into him?  I mean, it just exploded.  One problem.  I just exploded.  I am one Pablo Montoya.  Oh, what was he thinking? 
[00:28:30]  He lost control of his car.  Yeah.  Yeah, but if they're drying the track, aren't you just kind of fucking meandering?  Tonya climbs away.  And then he just climbs from the burning wreckage.  I love how he just walks away.  If you go to Deadspin, there's a better video with footage of, uh.  How did he run the race with that car like that?  I think he finished the race right there.  Yeah, that was it.  I think that was the end of his day.  Those guys are real men, though, man.  He's just casually walking away from a fucking burning car. 
[00:29:00]  It's on fire.  Like it's nothing.  It's completely twisted.  And he's just like, yeah, fuck.  We would be sprinting away, screaming like fucking girls.  Sprinting, leaving a trail of liquid shit.  Right.  Look at him just walking.  My car's on fire.  He was complaining about a bad vibration.  And you see all the fuel just spilling out.  So then they had to scrub the track.  So that was another two-hour delay?  It was a two-hour delay.  What time did this thing end?  I don't know.  I was like, I'll just read through Twitter when I'm riding the subway in the morning. 
[00:29:30]  And at like two o'clock in the morning, ESPN said who won.  And wow, so I think it was pretty long.  Pretty late.  How long does it take?  Usually?  They do 500 miles.  Oh, shit.  And then who was the driver that got 100,000 followers on Twitter during the delay?  He's sitting there.  He's like, well, if we're going to be just fucking hanging out, I'm going to tweet some pictures.  And people ate it up. 
[00:30:00]  And he got 100,000 followers in one day.  Yeah, he was just sitting on the track.  And he's taking pictures with his phone of the wreckage.  Right.  And tweeting it from the car.  That's pretty cool.  And they continued tweeting.  And people followed like crazy.  When do they realize how boring he is?  And he loses them two weeks.  Driving fast.  Round and to the left.  Send.  Send.  Matt Kenseth. 
[00:30:30]  Is that how you say it?  K-E-N-S-E-T-H.  Holds off Dale Earnhardt Jr.  To win the Daytona 500.  Look at that fuel.  At the Montoya plowed into a jet dryer on lap 160.  Spilling 200 gallons of fuel.  And delaying the race for two hours.  There you go.  All right.  You see, speaking of the Daytona 500, that the NBA All-Star game barely beat the rain delay coverage  of the original Daytona 500 in the ratings.  Rain delay coverage.  I'm becoming a big basketball fan again. 
[00:31:00]  And I can't watch that All-Star shit.  Apparently no one.  I really can't watch it.  No one wants to watch that garbage.  Was Jeremy Lin involved in it?  A little bit.  He was in one of the weekend events.  He wasn't in the actual game.  Oh, okay.  He's playing for two weeks.  No, they can't put him in the game.  No, it was up-and-coming players, whatever the fuck they call that.  I don't know if it was the rookie game.  Shining Stars.  Shining Stars.  They've got so many events now.  And, you know, I'm watching the Oscars instead of the All-Star game.  And people are trying to abuse me on Twitter.  I'm like, what?  The All-Star game?  It's like...  Well, that's how little anybody cares, especially the NBA. 
[00:31:30]  Like, they wouldn't schedule it the same night as the Oscars.  Yeah.  Right.  That was a dumb move on the NBA's part.  Because the Oscars got 39.3 million viewers, man.  Up from last year.  A little bit up from last year.  Wow.  Is Jeremy losing his luster?  Do you hate people that say their S's like that?  I hate people that say their S's like that.  He really lost his luster this last time.  Used to be a caller in a Joe Benningo like that.  Really?  I think Bruce from Flushing. 
[00:32:00]  Hey, Joe.  You know, the Mets, the Mets got to do something because they're not going to win this way.  Oh, he was awful.  And he talked a lot.  And the Giants, I don't know why the Giants...  I mean, what are they doing?  We're still Sims.  He's retired.  He's retired, you dummy.  Stop saying S words.  It was Brad Keselowski.  He had his iPhone in the car.  So, I thought these guys didn't have shit in the car.  Tweeting while he's driving.  That would be interesting. 
[00:32:30]  That's what he was doing.  Especially if he got a ticket.  Well, not in the actual race.  Drive the race.  Yeah, he gets a ticket.  Let's go to his Twitter and see if it's worthy of 100,000 followers in one fucking day, man.  But aren't you so cramped into that car that what's even the point of having your phone with you?  That's what I'm saying.  He was able to take pictures.  Yeah, because he wasn't driving.  He probably has a little zipper pocket.  Puts the phone in.  In his pants.  I guess he's fine in there.  He knows what to do.  I guess.  He knows where to put his phone. 
[00:33:00]  Yeah, these guys are professionals.  They know what they're doing.  They work really hard.  They work really fast.  Here comes a new character.  Can't say it's S's guy.  Whoa.  Keselowski.  Okay.  So how many?  Wow, he's got 202,000 followers.  Almost 203,000.  He had a little over 100 before this whole thing started, I would assume.  Yeah.  Well.  Anything on there, Sam?  Worth reading?  No, right?  No.  No, he's just like, ah. 
[00:33:30]  Well, there's a...  He's just lucky enough to be fucking...  Had his iPhone in the car.  There's a NASCAR official.  That's a good one.  Yeah.  That's kind of cool.  There you go.  Here's another one.  Obviously, other guys would have tweeted, but they didn't have their phones in their cars.  It is kind of cool to just have...  It's terrible.  These are Eric pictures.  Ah.  Oh.  Take a shot.  Iraq.  Ah, poor Iraq.  That's why I take the shot, though.  Remember Iraq's picture?  It's like, I got a picture of them rescuing people.  And it's like, it's just a boat. 
[00:34:00]  He's like, yeah, they were rescuing.  That's the boat that rescued people.  But he didn't get the rescue.  He didn't get anything.  He just got a boat on a river.  Iraq, would you acknowledge that your pictures suck?  That was pretty stupid.  Yeah, it was a shitty BlackBerry.  On 9-11, he got a picture at Newark Airport.  I don't think the device was at fault.  Oh, speaking of pictures...  No, I don't think so either.  Thank you, Sam.  I think it was operator error.  Yeah.  Operator error.  Roland's Instagrams, all right, we know what the skyline looks like. 
[00:34:30]  That motherfucker will just tweet pictures of Manhattan skyline, but not even, like, different ones.  It's the same one.  There's the Empire State Building.  I think that's the view from his building.  Is that what it is?  He's the same view every time.  But it's the same fucking picture.  What is he doing?  I'm going to be a fan of Roland's Instagram now.  Oh, you have to.  That's all I want to say.  It's so much fun.  It could be the most useless Instagram account I've ever seen is Roland's.  All right, show me this shit.  Look at Roland's pic. 
[00:35:00]  Occasionally, there's food, I guess.  Food!  All right.  But it's the same shot.  Daytime, nighttime sometimes.  You know, sometimes it's clouds, sometimes not.  But for the most part, it's just the skyline, the Empire State Building.  I'll tell you what, thanks to Roland.  A lot of the times I know what color the Empire State Building is lit.  That's true.  Does he do one every day?  Sometimes he does five in one shot.  Yeah, he Instagrams his fucking ass off. 
[00:35:30]  I didn't know that.  Yeah, Roland's a big Instagram.  He is an Instagramming motherfucker.  You wouldn't know what that is, though.  No, I don't want Instagram.  Why?  What's wrong with Instagram?  That's part of that iPhone culture.  You know who's really good with Instagram?  Bob Kelly.  That motherfucker takes some artistic shot show.  Bob throws all of his photos into Snapseed.  That's okay.  And then he Instagrams it.  I use Snapseed.  Yeah, no, no, no.  I'm just saying, like, he's not.  But he's really good at it.  Oh, yeah, he's very good at it.  That's a horrible picture. 
[00:36:00]  That's Roland's fucking shit pictures.  But it's like the tips of the building.  It's terrible.  What is that?  Too much sky.  Roland's got a lot of negative space in his photos.  Yeah, it's called negative space.  Yeah, but at least you can see the water and all of the buildings and then the moon at night time.  Maybe if that was one shot.  He takes the same.  That's beautiful.  Look at the clouds.  I'm annoyed it's the same picture.  That's beautiful.  Roland stinks.  Oh, look at that.  Is that?  Rays of light coming through clouds. 
[00:36:30]  I like that.  It's like a card you find in a religious store.  Yes.  Sorry about your abortion.  All right.  We get it.  I like these pictures.  They are all the same photos.  They're the same fucking picture.  Roland.  Look at that one.  That's all right.  All right.  That one's not bad.  But it's a photo you've seen 10,000 times.  Grand Central Station.  Grand Central Station.  Yeah, but Roland took it for the first time.  Oh, boy.  That's Long Island City, right?  That wouldn't be a bad photo at the Blues if he would have stopped the fucking car and taken it.  I know.  It's all blurry.  You can't stop the car in the FDR. 
[00:37:00]  His pictures stink.  You don't think he's a good Instagramer?  He's terrible at Instagram.  What about that one?  That was the same one again.  That looks like a postcard.  It's the same picture, though.  You would send that picture home to mom and dad if you were in New York.  If Roland took that picture once and left it in there, it would be fine.  Yes, and it's tilting to the right.  It's a slanted postcard.  It's terrible.  You know, all right.  Oh, God.  The UN and the Empire State Building back there.  There's the ice rink.  That's nice.  Rockefeller Center.  If you're not from New York, you get to see Roland's picture on the ice rink. 
[00:37:30]  Roland has a tourist's Instagram.  It really is.  It's like, don't you live here?  And again, the same fucking shot.  You know, that is true.  Most people that live in New York, they blow off all the touristy shit and go, look, I'm  going to find some unique stuff to Instagram.  You're right about that.  He loves that Empire State Building.  What's the difference between this and Twitter?  It's for pictures.  It's pictures.  Yeah, but so you tweet the picture.  Yeah, you can tweet it, too.  Well, you can.  You can link it to your Twitter.  At the same time, you can link it.  But you know what people do?  They kind of modify the picture a little bit. 
[00:38:00]  There's filters, and it's just...  And then there's some Jon Jones shit.  There's just too much stuff to keep up with.  Go to Bobby Kelly's.  I'm not going to keep up with a fucking Instagram account now, too.  No, you got to.  Fuck that.  It's easy.  You just go on there.  I follow Travis.  Twitter, Facebook, and Google+.  Google+.  Google+.  They're trying, though.  Oh, God.  They're throwing commercials at us, hoping the whole world gets into Google+.  Jesus.  Let's see.  Look at Bobby's now. 
[00:38:30]  As opposed to what we just looked at, shitty Rollins.  Mm-hmm.  Fucking Rollins.  Enough.  I've enjoyed Bobby's Instagram, actually.  Enough of your goddamn Empire State...  Rollins, I would give a...  I'd give a C-.  C-?  No.  That is a...  I'd be nice and give him a D.  D?  Is he still passing?  Barely.  All right, let's give him a D.  He's got to step it up, though.  Let's give him a D.  Who's this?  That's not an accurate.  It's a different Rob Kelly.  Oh, my God.  There isn't another Bob Kelly.  There's not room enough for another Bob Kelly.  Hey, get a load of fets over there. 
[00:39:00]  You got it?  Robert Kelly live.  Robert Kelly live.  We got Jim in Fresno, by the way, standing by.  Jim.  He needs an update on the turd table challenge.  We'll give you an update on the turd table challenge in a minute.  Yes.  Is this Bob Kelly?  Yeah.  Bob Kelly.  Look, his pictures have a lot of different colors going on.  I like that.  Yes.  Yes.  Very colorful.  What comedy club was that?  Do we know? 
[00:39:30]  Well, he's in...  I think he was in Vegas.  That was a Vegas sub-picture?  He was in Vegas.  So he took a picture of that fake Eiffel Tower.  Could you guys give out the account so people could play along at home?  It was Robert Kelly live on Instagram.  All right.  Robert Kelly live.  He was in Paris?  No, that's Vegas.  Oh, that's the Vegas Paris?  Yeah.  But you're right about the cheating.  I don't agree with putting it in the extra...  It's not cheating.  You make it interesting for people.  Yeah, but it's got to look good.  But you've already got your filters.  That's on Instagram.  It's not cheating if it's available to everybody.  No, he's doing a very good job.  You see that top left one there.  Right. 
[00:40:00]  No, left lower.  One down there.  Yeah, see?  That's kind of cool.  Look, it's a lot of blues in that.  I like that.  See, that's very good.  Yeah.  Bobby's a good Instagrammer.  He sure is.  Bobby's good at Snapseed.  Yeah.  So who cares?  He's not a good Instagrammer.  I can never find interesting enough...  Sure we could, but I don't want to.  I can't find interesting enough subject matter, so all of mine are guns.  Yeah, all of mine are my dog and my kid.  You've got to leave your house, boy.  Let me see that one on the top.  There's a lot of stuff to see out there in the world.  That's a pretty cool shot.  Yeah. 
[00:40:30]  Yeah.  It's a streetlight.  Where do you get Snapseed from?  It's an app.  It's a photo editing app.  Oh.  Put it in there.  See, the thing with Instagrammers, when you take the picture,  do you have to take the picture and then load it into Instagram from Snapseed?  Go.  Well, you would take a picture.  You would load it into Snapseed.  It's a photo editing program.  Right.  You would save it back onto your phone.  And all Instagram pictures, they're square.  They're square pictures, so you've got to crop them.  But if you're already cheating with your pictures with Instagram, then go Snapseed.  Go all in.  But you're not cheating with Instagram because Instagram gives you filters. 
[00:41:00]  I would rather use Snapseed because it seems like it gives you more options.  Sure it does.  You could be good with Instagram, too, though.  We got some Instagram purists in the studio.  What do you want, the sepia filter?  I want the sepia filter, whatever it's called.  I like that filter.  Sepia.  I like it.  I used a vintage filter on a picture yesterday.  It was the picture of the FDNY fire truck hosing down some unruly teens that were assaulting 
[00:41:30]  some police officers.  And when the fire department showed up, they turned the hoses on them.  And I took the picture and used the vintage black and white filter.  And it looked fantastic.  Happier times for you?  Yeah.  You love those black and white photos, don't you?  I think they're very pleasant.  See, that's an old-style gangster type picture.  Yeah, it's amazing you don't hang out with black people when you fucking, you live like  a Snoop video. 
[00:42:00]  That's your whole fucking life is right there on that.  People would swear that's Lil Wayne's house.  Yeah.  Well, it's...  You really should fucking embrace this.  I think the bow tie, a little...  You should embrace this shit.  It's a bunch of Remington ammunition.  Could you explain the hosing fucking picture?  I don't know this story.  Oh, the story was a gang, a gang of unruly female youths were outside this girl's house  that they had been bullying in Staten Island. 
[00:42:30]  Okay.  They'd been bullying her.  And 50 of them showed up in front of this house, and they're just taunting and telling  her to come out.  They must have really hated her.  They hate her.  Why did they hate her that much that 50 could show up?  I don't know.  I think it was...  Someone explained it as a he said, she said kind of situation.  But 50 girls?  50.  Well, you know...  Can you get 50 guys together?  No, but there are certain people that can gather up 50 people and, you know, very quickly.  But she must have really did something awful.  I don't know.  All right, go ahead.  I don't know.  Well, she apparently also has a heart condition, and they were yelling, come out here. 
[00:43:00]  We'll punch you in the chest.  We'll fix that heart condition.  Wow.  Yeah.  Did she come out?  No.  Were they really trying to help her?  No.  I don't think they were.  So a couple of cops show up, a male and a female officer, and they told them to leave.  They were trying to arrest one of these unruly youths.  Right.  And the whole gang turned on both of them and started beating the shit out of the cops.  And jumping on the cars.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Jumping on the cars.  I see that in this movie I saw recently.  Exactly.  And so FDNY was right around the corner. 
[00:43:30]  They hear this problem's going on.  And they pull up with one of the fire trucks and just get to the big water cannon on top  and just start hosing the crowd down.  Is that illegal?  Yeah.  It's got to be.  They're defending the police officer.  They're lucky the cops didn't shoot one of these fucking animals for attacking them.  Exactly.  Dang attacking the cops?  Yeah.  But you know how it works in this world.  I bet you there'll be a problem at the turn of the hoses on.  I was thinking there's going to be a problem.  Yeah.  Somebody's going to say something.  It's not illegal because you know someone's going to step forward and go, oh, they didn't 
[00:44:00]  have to do that.  Hey, if these fucking assholes want to start beating up cops like that, then whatever the  consequences are.  I absolutely agree with you.  But you know someone will step forward.  The most shocking.  Someone's going to have a major problem with that.  The most shocking part of the whole story was that the fire department was actually helping  the police.  Oh, they don't like each other.  That's rare.  They don't, right?  Oh, they don't like each other.  Yeah.  But, you know, when you get a chance to turn the hoses on, you got to, you know.  That must have been a tough decision. 
[00:44:30]  Because you're right.  In New York, they don't like each other.  That is well known.  Maybe it's gotten better.  I don't know.  Yeah, maybe it has.  Maybe it's gotten a little better.  I don't know.  But yeah, so there was a picture of that.  Where is it?  We're looking for it.  And I think it got on my Twitter.  I don't know.  Oh, did you?  Is that story in the paper?  Yeah.  I read two papers today.  I didn't see that story.  It was on Drudge last night.  Is it in the actual paper, though?  Yep.  Mold.  Let me see.  If you go to my Twitter and just go to my tweets and go down, down, down. 
[00:45:00]  Wait a minute.  That's vintage.  Oh, yeah.  Go to the top.  Top one.  Top post.  Top post.  Fuck you.  There.  Turn it this way, Sam, so we're all enjoying it.  Oh, Jesus.  See, now it's vintage.  Did you add the dog?  No, a friend added the dog.  That's funny.  There's a German shepherd.  That really does look old school, though, man.  Yeah, if it wasn't for the newer fire vehicle.  Yeah, and the iPhones.  Oh, my God.  Yeah, you could go back to the original one.  That's on mine, Down Aways. 
[00:45:30]  A little further down.  Keep going.  Keep going.  Keep going.  Ha, ha, bravo.  There you go.  Ha, ha, bravo.  No, no.  Up right there.  Wow.  He's the worst.  Yeah.  That's the original picture right there.  Doesn't that look like fun?  Yeah.  That fireman's laughing his balls off.  Wow, look at that.  Yeah, someone's going to have a problem with this.  Then they'll hear what happened.  A gang turned on two cops.  Yeah.  You can't protest.  You can't come out against that.  You just said.  And the only force they use is a fire hose instead of fucking macing and pulling a pistol. 
[00:46:00]  But this evokes images of the civil rights movement that were.  Shut the fuck up.  Look, I'm all in, but I'm telling you, someone's going to fucking step forward.  They should have hit him with blueberry pies.  Nice.  Mm-hmm.  Fucking heck.  Man.  All right.  All right.  That was a.  Oh, my God.  We're going to go to break.  Yeah.  And we got a bowler celebrating.  The audio is hilarious. 
[00:46:30]  It's a mad house.  And we got a sex shop that burned down.  And they're saying greatest interview ever.  Oh, yeah?  This guy rules.  Are you kidding me?  But you're writing ever?  Greatest sex shop interview ever.  Oh, okay.  Greatest sex shop interview ever.  He's really pissed off that his sex shop's gone.  I wouldn't say he's pissed off.  He's just very eccentric.  Really?  Yeah.  I can't wait to play that next.  God, I watched the fucking show last night. 
[00:47:00]  I should have stuck to hoarders.  It would have been less disgusting.  You like your hoarders on Mondays.  I know, but I DVR'd it because I wanted to see this young Indian boy with half a fucking  twin growing out of his chest.  And they had to.  And they had to cut it off.  He had to go to some hospital and have it cut off.  It was two giant legs dangling from his stomach and then two fucking atrophied arms. 
[00:47:30]  And then they had to actually blur out the little twin's ball sack that was hanging there.  And the kid's playing soccer in India.  Of course he is.  And the legs are flopping around again.  Doing push-ups like a motherfucker.  That's a push-up doing here.  He's got a crab growing out of his chest.  It was disgusting.  That had to be TLC.  Oh, of course.  It was TLC.  Yeah, TLC is, they rock.  It was along with the eye-bleeding boy.  And then they had the tumor face guy.  Remember tumor face guy?  Yeah. 
[00:48:00]  And they cut the tumors off his face.  I would just leave the tumors.  You're not going to get a job.  There he is.  Let me see him.  Let me see little Indian motherfucker.  Why does this shit happen in India so much?  What's going on in India?  Half of them live in fucking dumps.  The toxic water and shit you're probably drinking there.  It's so fucked up.  Is that the kid with a shirt on?  You wouldn't know.  Well, no, you would beforehand.  Yeah.  Because he wore a shirt, but the feet dangled out the bottom of the shirt.  Oh, my God.  You'd have to buy him shirt shoes.  Hey, I want a nice shirt shoes set first. 
[00:48:30]  Shirt shoes.  Some of that shit moves.  Were the legs moving?  I didn't see it moving.  But the fucked up thing was.  Some of that shit moves like it's kind of a lie.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  This wasn't.  This just dangled there.  Right.  But there was a hell of a blood supply going to this thing.  So they said it was going to be hard on his heart.  So they had to cut this fucking monstrosity off.  So they took it.  And then they find the main artery that's going into it.  And they sealed it off. 
[00:49:00]  And then right after they do it, you just see the thing start turning gray.  Yeah.  That fast?  Yeah.  Is there a head inside, too?  Well, there was some bowels inside and shit.  Oh, my God.  It was just fucking disgusting.  Could he dance with those little legs?  You know how great that would be if he's like,  Yeah, da, da, da, da, da, cha, and the little feet.  Yeah, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da.  He's doing the Charleston with his feet.  He's growing his arms up in the air like old school.  There he goes.  Whoa.  His feet are flying over his shoulders. 
[00:49:30]  Oh, his shirt shoes were hit.  His shirt shoes pants were hit.  He's laying down on the floor tap dancing.  Monstrosity, this kid.  I want to see video of this kid.  Oh, it was horrific.  It was so bad.  So what does he look like today?  They cut the thing off.  And now he's got like a big bump on his chest.  But when he wears a shirt, you can't tell.  What's the bump?  And then they brought him back to his village.  Well, you know, that kind of fucks the bones up in there and everything. 
[00:50:00]  Right, right.  But they went back to his village.  And killed everybody so this doesn't happen again.  Exactly.  It was that kind of village.  They'd look at him like, you know, oh, Satan.  And they had another conjoined twin issue.  It was some two boys.  And then right at like the stomach, it turned into one.  Jesus.  And then they were like, well, we're going to take them to the hospital and scan them to see if they could be separated.  And, you know, just watching them on TV, you're like, they can't be separated. 
[00:50:30]  They share one lower half.  They don't know any better.  So you just leave.  Wow.  That's the.  What the fuck?  What the fuck is that?  That's the scariest thing ever.  I'm talking to listeners now.  Go to Medical Anomalies on YouTube.  That's him, dude.  That's the title of the video.  He looks like there's another boy just hanging out of him.  Wow.  He's got a fucking.  And that's the ass, too.  Yeah, waiting to just be ass fucked.  Yeah, that's great.  If he goes to jail, that guy's in deep trouble.  From both sides are hitting him.  You can't cover up both ways. 
[00:51:00]  No.  No.  Oh, I see.  He spends the whole night just rolling over, over and over and over and over again.  He is grody.  Medical Anomalies on YouTube.  Go ahead.  Play this fucking thing.  Yeah.  Around the world.  There are people with extreme medical conditions.  Just all of a sudden, blood starts running out of his eyes.  Some blame their conditions on superstition.  This affliction was brought on through the working of Satan.  Oh, fuck it off.  Medical experts see them as mysteries for which a treatment must be found. 
[00:51:30]  Those extra body parts result in increased work on the heart, increased risk of infection.  This is a very disconcerting problem.  Medical Anomalies, Thursday at 10 to 10.  Freak show.  All right, why was the guy bleeding from his eyes?  I don't know.  Didn't you watch the show?  They don't know.  Oh, they don't know.  Yeah, no one knows.  What do you mean no one knows?  You can't figure that one out.  I don't know.  They're just bleeding from the eyeballs.  I don't know.  I didn't watch the end of that one.  Oh.  I can give a shit about old bloody guys. 
[00:52:00]  I wanted to see this kid with an ass growing out of the front of his fucking...  Oh my God, that's awful.  Cute kid, by the way.  Fuck yourself in the ass, actually.  Adorable kid.  Yeah, the funniest part, though, is when they lifted the thing up, where they're trying  to look at where they're going to cut it off, and they had to blur out the little fucking  conjoined twin balls.  So they had to grade immediately?  Yeah, yeah.  Once the blood supply was cut off, it was like, might as well be a dead body laying there.  Wow.  And then they took it, and they laid it out on the table.  It was just weird legs. 
[00:52:30]  Just legs.  It looked like a cut-in-half body laying on the table.  Wow.  I don't know how that feels.  Can you move the legs?  Or are they just hanging?  No, they're just dangling there.  The kid was all upset that he was going to lose it, too.  Of course.  You know, it's like his little brother.  He doesn't know any better.  Yeah.  Half the shit you don't know any better.  Little dummy.  I bet you his favorite thing to do is, I'm going to jump back and spank myself.  He was a hit at the parties.  Oh, it certainly would be.  He's doing the self-spank dance. 
[00:53:00]  Just take the useless legs after he cut it off and put it at a call center in India.  See, they do a better job than fight.  A little commentary there.  A little social commentary with our company.  By the way, Western Union is the worst company.  Are they still there?  They're fucking...  All their customer service is out of India.  Or for the Philippines.  The Philippines.  Oh.  They're terrible.  I've never dealt with a company that was so awful to deal with, customer service-wise.  What do people use Western Union for?  To send money where PayPal is so good. 
[00:53:30]  It just...  I'll tell you one thing.  You can get cash instantly with Western Union.  Gambling sites.  Take Western Union.  Oh.  They're terrible.  Jimmy's delving into a little of the online gambling.  No, I was actually trying to send money to my ex.  And we were going to use Western Union.  It's just an abominable...  And was there a reason you didn't use PayPal?  She used to use the cash fast.  And my credit...  For some reason, my...  Yes.  And not a white one.  So there was...  For some reason, one of my cell phones doesn't tie into my address or whatever. 
[00:54:00]  They couldn't look it up.  So I call up and it says, the system is denying you.  I'm like, but I already had an account.  The system is denying.  But it really is like future world.  And I'm like, what's wrong?  We don't know.  Who can I talk to?  No one.  The system said no.  It's these fucking dumb...  I said to a guy, how does it feel to be worthless?  Like, you have no function.  These worthless, worthless people.  I don't know.  Why are you even on the phone with me?  I don't know, motherfucker.  It's truly...  It's the worst company I've ever dealt with. 
[00:54:30]  There's also certain banks that won't take Western Union...  Or they won't allow you to send money through.  Like, I tried years ago with Chase, and Chase doesn't allow Western Union transfers.  Why?  They just don't.  Do they want you to use their fucking shitty system?  Maybe, or maybe it's, you know, a security thing.  But your ex should just get a PayPal debit card.  And then you can send her money through PayPal.  She can use it on a debit card instantly.  Oh, wait a minute.  So, the second it gets there...  Yeah.  I have a PayPal debit card.  Any money in my PayPal account, I can use, like, a credit card. 
[00:55:00]  It's a MasterCard.  So, but...  I mean, because...  Fuck!  What a genius idea!  Isn't it?  Yeah.  PayPal debit card?  Let me see.  Oh.  I had a dick!  Travis hands it to Jimmy.  Jimmy flings it across the room without even looking at it.  I haven't been here seven years.  I know.  What the fuck were you thinking?  We're going to break...  By the way, we got a second one.  A second kid dead in the Ohio shooting. 
[00:55:30]  Yeah, someone just died of their injuries from that asshole fucking shooting up to school.  Yeah, there was a couple critical.  Yeah.  Now we got two dead.  All right.  We'll continue.  Stay there.  The O.P.  Anthony Channel.  On Sirius XM.  There's that old guy over there.  Uncle Paul, Uncle Paul.  With the creepy old guy stare.  Uncle Paul.  Now he's coming over here.  Slowly limping down the hall.  It's too late now, because here comes Uncle Paul. 
[00:56:00]  Let me show you how to make a big boy love you.  On today's episode, Uncle Paul reminisces about his favorite photograph.  Yeah, that's Teddy.  That's Teddy and his little brother.  The one on the other side's the girl.  She's kind of tomboyish.  She likes to play basketball.  Have her socks taken off.  Coochie coo.  You tickle him in a tub.  Oh, Uncle Paul.  My feet are dirty.  You wash him.  Get him in a tub.  Clean their feet good. 
[00:56:30]  Take your shorts off.  Let me kiss your toes.  Oh, yeah.  They all had to stay in my bed, because they all had bed bugs in their cribs.  Come in here, so there's no bed bugs.  And then them goddamn parents are accusing me, saying, how come he ain't walking right?  I don't know.  I didn't do nothing.  Bunch of lies.  Those damn denar tests.  They said my denar was on the boy's hiney.  I don't know what that means.  Who's that old guy over there?  Uncle Paul. 
[00:57:00]  Uncle Paul.  With the creepy old guy staring.  Uncle Paul.  Now he's coming over here.  Slowly limping down the hall.  It's too late now, because here comes Uncle Paul.  Thanks for calling the Opie and Anthony F.U. line.  Here's the latest batch of F.U.'s.  Fuck you!  Hey, this fuck you goes after the governor of New Jersey.  Flagged at half-mast for that fucking druggie Whitney Houston.  Half-mast is reserved for the servicemen and people who serve this country. 
[00:57:30]  Fuck you, you fat fuck.  Fuck you!  Yeah, I'd like to give a big F.U. to the security guard.  I'm just walking around all day going, good morning.  Good morning.  I can't stop.  Fuck you.  Fuck you!  Yeah, this F.U. goes after the same primetime Roberts.  Oh, fuck you.  Fuck you!  I'd like to give a fuck you to this girl that I was...  She...  I met her in college, and she rubbed up against me.  And she was giving me attention. 
[00:58:00]  And it turns out she has a boyfriend.  Now she wants nothing to do with me, but I keep messaging her.  And she still wants nothing to do with me.  Fuck you!  Fuck you!  Yeah, I want to do a big fuck you to myself.  My wife's away on business for four days, and I'm not too much going to push you to fucking  get a girl from Craigslist to come over.  Fuck you, me.  Fuck you!  Fuck you!  I'd like to give an F.U. to the O.B. and Anthony show for bullying E-Rock and calling him fat. 
[00:58:30]  Honestly, that's hurtful and bad.  Don't call him fat.  Fuck you!  I'd like to send a big fuck you to whoever does the...  Fuck.  Fuck you!  Call the O.B. and Anthony F.U. line, 866-FU-LINE-1.  That's 866-FU-LINE-1. 
[00:59:00]  Sirius XM.  Sirius XM.  Yeah.  Yeah.  This is the O.B. and Anthony show.  Get in topical. 
[00:59:30]  Hold up!  Wait a minute!  With the Sex Man.  Good morning, Sexy!  Good morning.  You too, huh?  I'm a big U2 fan, so I know this one.  Being a child of the 80s, yes.  I am a child of the 80s.  Abso-fucking-lutely.  I stick to that.  What?  We've gone right back to the basic thing E-Rock's done.  Yesterday was so good.  I know. 
[01:00:00]  Well, not every day has something that...  What's today?  Bono's birthday?  I'll fucking bite your forehead.  No, it's not.  It is Gavin McCloud's birthday.  Ooh!  He's still alive?  Apparently 81.  Love Boat guy?  Yeah.  81.  Damn.  Obviously, War came out.  How many years?  29 years ago for the children of the 80s in the studio.  Damn!  What is War?  U2's album that kind of put him over the top.  Oh.  Boy came before War, but War was the one that really got a lot of fucking people interested 
[01:00:30]  in U2, in my opinion.  Some would say that's not true.  But I think War really put him over the top.  Oh, yeah?  And you like the War?  I don't know.  Well, this is more like kind of rock and roll-ish, the U2 War.  I could deal with U2.  Your brother makes a living off U2.  I know.  I just, I could deal with it.  Does he do anything from War?  Oh, yeah.  He does?  Yeah.  29 years ago.  Wow.  29 years. 
[01:01:00]  Also, the final episode of MASH aired 29 years ago today.  No way.  On the same fucking day.  U2's war comes out and MASH is over.  Yeah.  I would never have guessed that.  If you said, what happened first?  I would have said, oh, wow.  Look at E-Rock.  Oh, E-Rock is awake today.  What, are you on a Ron and Fez show?  Fuck, you want a muffin?  But he doesn't play the theme song.  No, he plays this with the lyrics.  Because it's a little longer.  This is from the movie, I think.  You know, right?  Yeah.  God.  This is a good tune. 
[01:01:30]  I think they used it at the very end, too, this version.  Oh, you know what?  For the helicopter scene.  Oh, wow.  This is Peter, Paul, and Mary.  Let's cut that.  What was this?  Yeah.  Was this guy ever famous for another song?  Yes.  That's the question today.  He wrote, we're going to make it after all.  And he wrote the Alice theme song.  There's a new girl in town. 
[01:02:00]  Yeah.  I wish you were doing good.  A fresh freckle face in your name, bud.  Yuck.  Fresh freckle face?  Really?  She had a hysterectomy.  Fucking, where's the fresh freckle face?  You have a son, a beat up old pussy, and you're slinging hash potatoes.  Fuck yourself.  You have a jazzy voice.  And a fresh freckle face.  Yeah.  You know who has a fresh freckle face?  The guy who didn't want to... 
[01:02:30]  So, isn't this great?  I've got a fresh freckle face.  In the neighborhood.  In the neighborhood.  No, I like to kick it myself for nothing.  Yeah, I know.  It's my favorite sport.  Oh, you want the other version?  Yes!  Stop playing this!  There you go.  Yeah!  Yeah.  Here it goes. 
[01:03:00]  Why do we put it on this?  Oh, what have you enjoyed doing, Alice?  I've been keeping my soul for nothing.  Was my favorite sport.  I had to take off and start enjoying.  Cause life's too short.  Uh-oh.  Too short.  Too good in town.  Cause I'm feeling good.  Get a smile.  Got a song for the neighbor. 
[01:03:30]  And it's so great when you stand on your own two feet.  And there's girls here to sail.  With some love and love life.  I hate that she does the ba-ba-ba-ba.  Whatever.  I'm so sweet.  Oh, she didn't do it.  Wow.  That is fucking horrid.  Every time I hear it.  When she would go ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba. 
[01:04:00]  Fresh record.  They didn't play that one in that version.  That's all right.  No.  That's okay.  The world has decided this sucks at this point.  It's fa-fa-fa-fa-fa-fa-fa-fa-fa-fa-fa.  All right.  Life's too short.  There's a new girl in town.  And she's 52. 
[01:04:30]  She's got an adult son and no career.  Because she's a high school dropout to get pregnant young.  Facing menopause is a new girl.  Not quite Mary Tyler Moore, huh?  No.  No.  Oh, God.  Her hopes and dreams.  You work at a diner.  Shut up.  Your husband left you.  Fucking got some worthless son. 
[01:05:00]  Hopefully some black girl she used to sing with.  I hope that's who the husband cheated on her with.  That's why she had to get out of town.  Because she was too embarrassed.  Because he was fucking plugging this chick in all the clubs she used to sing at poorly.  That affected voice.  Oh.  Oh, man.  There's a new girl in town.  And she's looking good.  Oh, God.  Freckled face.  In the name of the Lord.  There's a new girl in town.  All right. 
[01:05:30]  You don't like what she says.  She's looking good.  Looking good.  Rob goes, I heard this bit last week, right?  Yes, Rob.  Ah, yeah.  Yes, yes.  You'll hear a bunch of it ten days ago.  You'll hear it as many times as we want to do it, Rob.  Exactly.  Fuck yourself.  We focus on things.  That's right.  We can't get off of them.  Stay tuned, shithead.  The Ropers are coming up.  Dancing with the plungers. 
[01:06:00]  Do you know how many tweets I've gotten when people are thinking of this song?  They're so angry that they can't get it out of their head.  This ruins people's lives.  It's all I want to talk about is the Ropers.  It's such a doofus song. 
[01:06:30]  Like, it's just a doofus walking around to this music.  It's the beginning of it.  That's so funny because you know what's coming.  Every time.  It's terrible.  It's terrible.  It's terrible.  All right. 
[01:07:00]  It's a little Danny Cooksey-looking kid. 
[01:07:30]  Evan.  Evan Colby.  Wow.  Holy shit, that's fucking funny.  That was horribly funny.  We got to get to the greatest interview ever, by the way.  Oh, right.  Travis is very excited about this.  But first, we got the bowler thing.  It's quick.  This is...  Pete Weber?  Pete Weber.  We don't know shit about bowling.  Was this a big deal?  That he won a tournament? 
[01:08:00]  Apparently so.  Why?  Because he always wins?  It's bowling?  I don't know.  Strike to claim it.  A strike to claim it.  And he got it!  Who do you think you are?  I am.  Who do you think you are?  I am. 
[01:08:30]  Who do you think you are?  I am.  Get it right!  It's still bowling.  Who cares about bowling?  That was like a World Series walk-off homer.  What was the bowling thing about it?  Is it a big tournament?  I have no idea.  And no one cares, right?  No.  No one cares.  It's somewhere in Jersey.  Was that a Jersey fucking tournament?  I think it was.  I think it was.  I think it was playing in Jersey.  Womp.  Womp.  Womp.  Womp.  Womp.  Believe me.  Someone tweeted me, I hate this sound. 
[01:09:00]  It's the sound of an orphan getting molested with a balloon animal.  I've been Roper'd.  Rick Roper'd.  Oh, man.  That's horrible.  Thank you.  Fuck, man. 
[01:09:30]  I can't take it.  Fucking Tambor was in that.  Yeah, you believe in that?  Did you believe in that?  Jesus.  All right.  What's the greatest interview ever there, Travis?  I think you guys should just watch the video because this...  Oh, really?  Yeah, he's...  Oh.  Oh, man.  Is it this guy?  Yeah, it's this guy.  You saw this guy?  Oh.  You saw this guy?  No.  He just looks like the kind of guy that would do a dopey-ass interview and sound stupid.  Sometimes he's a little tough to understand because he's got a very thick Australian accent.  Oh, nice.  I know.  I've watched it three times, so I might be able to translate some things. 
[01:10:00]  Oh, good.  All right.  I'll understand.  So we might need your help.  If you want to play along at home, Sex Shop Fire in King's Cross on YouTube.  Let's play this.  Tell me, when did you find out there was a fire at the shop?  Around.  It would have been about...  How long?  About 40 minutes ago.  And where were you?  Were you around?  I was at King's Cross.  And I was speaking to the employee at the shop.  And he said, I thought he said, I could smell shit.  And I go, no, I said, no shit.  It's a gate back through.  And he goes, no, I smell smoke.  I said, you better go check that out. 
[01:10:30]  And before I knew it, they go, the fucking whole thing's on fire.  They've blocked the roads off.  I couldn't even get through.  I parked in the loading zone.  So now I'm going to get another fucking parking ticket.  That's about 6,000 bucks now.  Yeah.  And now it's just before Mardi Gras, man.  Yeah.  But I reckon, man, there's another place called the Pleasure Lounge.  Our competition.  All right.  He used to be our friend of ours.  I reckon he did.  I reckon this, you know.  Wipe us out.  What do you think?  Possible?  I don't know. 
[01:11:00]  Anything's possible.  It's quite a quickie dick.  Like, a week before Mardi Gras, let's wipe out.  Quinky dick.  You know?  So tell me a bit about The Den.  The Den is a retail store.  Oh, my God.  Sells, you know, dildos, butt plugs, fucking anal beads.  But the main business is, look, it's a gay sauna.  So they pay $10 and they get those big streams there, pornos.  They fuck each other.  There's a succitorium.  You put your cock in a hole.  Some guy sucks you off.  And I'm like, what are you about?  He's got a fucking joke.  This is the world.  Holy shit.  Sorry about a glory hole in there. 
[01:11:30]  What else did he say in there?  I've seen a couple things.  He's accusing the other sex shop of possibly starting the fire because he said what a coinkydink it was.  Oh, wow.  Okay.  Coinkydink.  And then he's describing, you know, all the gay shenanigans that go on.  Yeah, sauna.  Yeah, it's a succitorium.  I am sure.  Wow.  All right.  Yeah.  And he got a parking ticket.  There you go.  Parking ticket?  Yeah.  Over there?  So was he, he liked the shop that's on fire?  I think he's a big fan, yeah.  Okay.  Put your cock in a hole. 
[01:12:00]  Some guy sucks you off.  And look, this is not a fucking joke.  This is how it goes.  This is the world of the age, man, yeah.  And this is one of the better ones, yeah.  This is quite clean.  There's some fucking future ones around him, man.  But yeah, I thought he was joking.  I thought he said shit.  I go, yeah, yeah.  It usually does smell as shit, man.  You know?  It's a fucking gay room, man.  But no, obviously not smoke.  And then he goes, I checked you out.  And he goes, the smell stopped.  All right?  And he goes, and I went back. 
[01:12:30]  And he goes, went back in.  And he goes, and it just erupted.  He goes, it fucking, and he goes, mate, I just saw him.  And he's fucking, he goes, I'm going to check you out.  He goes, I just got checked out by the ant guns.  I go, what are you doing there?  He goes, I'm getting a beer.  I said, all right?  I'm enjoying you.  It's not fucking parched.  But yeah, that's fucked, mate.  But you know what I'm saying?  I don't get fucked, mate.  It's pretty good.  Now, watch how I'm going to be on tonight so I can watch myself.  Oh, I don't know.  I don't know if it'll be on the 5 o'clock news.  It'll probably be like beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep. 
[01:13:00]  When did his tattoo say get fucked?  Yes.  On his bicep.  Get fucked on his bicep, yeah.  He's got a tattoo that says get fucked.  He's the greatest.  What else did he say in there?  I didn't understand.  Oh, he was talking about getting a beer with the guy who runs the sex shop because he's  parched.  And, you know, it smells like shit because it's a gay room.  Because it's a gay room.  It always smells like shit.  Yeah.  I just thought he was great.  And, of course, it all goes out of the end.  Everything he said.  Oh, man. 
[01:13:30]  Those Aussies are fucked up.  They're all wild people.  The wild man.  Got a packing ticket?  Over there?  $6,000.  What's $6,000 over there?  $100?  $200 maybe?  I wonder if he's a gay guy or if he just knows the club.  Maybe he is.  I think he's gay.  Okay, get fucked.  Yeah.  Because he didn't have the gay accent like they do here.  Like, oh my God.  Or it's so soft.  Maybe that was the gay accent for Australia. 
[01:14:00]  We just can't pick it up.  Yeah.  We just don't know.  Yeah.  Like aborigine dick.  It's not like this, that whole effeminate thing that's so, you know, prevalent here.  And the top.  I don't like the bottom.  Sloppy party bottom.  That's what I like.  Laying down.  Getting fucked by a bunch of gentlemen.  I like to, as we say, put the old didgeridoo where the shit comes out.  Place smells like shit. 
[01:14:30]  Didgeridoo.  I just forgot what I have to go check.  Oh.  Hopefully it's your blood test results.  It's not good.  That jazz guy was supposed to make another apology over the weekend.  Oh, fuck yeah.  I gotta go see if it's online.  Mike Vicker?  Yeah, something like that.  No, Mike...  Vicky or Vibby?  Oh, it's a great story you missed when you were gone.  Oh, yeah.  Anthony didn't...  This fucking guy.  Where was that?  In London?  London, England.  Or Slough?  This guy's at a radio station.  Yeah.  And his whole job is to kind of watch the board as this jazz show was going on for this other guy. 
[01:15:00]  Yeah.  And he was watching gay porno.  Gay porno.  Uh-oh.  And had the pot up.  And it was potted up.  Do we have that disc?  We should replay that.  Guy porno?  It's in the back?  Go get it.  Fast.  Yeah, run, Eric.  I know.  And we definitely need an update because he was going to go for the big over-the-top apology.  Let's watch him run.  You can hear him run.  Eric's a very loud run.  He's a loud walker.  He's a trudger.  He trudges.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, here you go.  Oh, my God.  He don't run anymore.  He's not going to run.  Wow.  He's getting a little bigger than he was.  Look at how frumpy he is. 
[01:15:30]  He doesn't run anymore.  He's a heavy-footed idiot.  Oh, I wish ceiling tiles were falling out of the ceiling when he runs by them just from  the vibration.  Look at your water, everybody, for your Jurassic Park moment.  Mike Vitti.  Poor Mike Vitti.  Vitti well.  Well, a lot of people think Mike Vitti was watching the gay porn because it's his show,  but it was pre-recorded.  Oh, shit.  But there was a dummy at the radio station that just had to push all the buttons for Mike  Vitti, who already recorded his show. 
[01:16:00]  Oh, no.  But the average fucking radio listener doesn't know that shit, so they think Mike Vitti,  who's a big star in the jazz world.  He's a big star.  You know, they thought he was the one that was doing the gay porn.  No.  Yeah, we got the clip.  It's classic.  It takes a little while to get going, no?  Yeah, it's like two and a half minutes, I think, or close to four, maybe.  It's worth it.  So this is the actual album.  This one's going out, obviously. 
[01:16:30]  Yeah.  A little jazz song on Mike Vitti's show.  And I will look for a love, that's true.  Yeah, you know, I'm ready to head in a bowl for you.  So don't you push me away.  I won't let you slip back into yesterday.  He's watching some deep dicking, too. 
[01:17:00]  That's a proper fuckie.  Oh, yeah, there's balls hitting.  Oh, yeah, there's balls hitting.  Oh, yeah, there's balls hitting. 
[01:17:30]  With the music, it's great.  It's got the rhythm. 
[01:18:00]  It's the soundtrack for the fuck.  Guy has no idea it's going out on the air.  He's just enjoying himself. 
[01:18:30]  The pheasantry in London's swanky.  He was so fucking lathered up out of his fucking mind.  He didn't realize the song faded out.  He missed the fucking.  And goes, holy fuck, I got to play commercials right now for Mike Vitti.  Once again, Mike Vitti not in studio.  Oh, man.  This guy is throwing Mike Vitti under the bus.  This guy is in a lather.  But it continues with the commercials.  The pheasantry in London's swanky Kings Road, Chelsea.  Plus the fantastic music room in the Maidstone restaurant.  To enjoy the amazing sound of the atmosphere. 
[01:19:00]  theasantry, plus the musicians and jazz band.  A favorite of his favorite.  The play is at jazzfm.com to win for gifts to a variety of pizza express.  It's all with jazz fm.  I'm Paul Strunman, MD of Wish Trek.  When I set up my own business, developing education.  You think the sponsors like this?  yeah they're selling the seat cushions  ah yes steven singer jeweler

[01:21:00]  what was the original uh apology again or whatever  um  what was it unintentional uh  it was a regrettable incident  right  regrettable incident  well  not for the two involved  yeah  sounded like they were having a blast  they won't have regrets for a few years  if you know what i mean  what what what what what  oh fuck  oh  oh  oh fuck  oh 
[01:21:30]  oh fuck  oh  oh fuck  Audra Lindley's a man.  She really is.  And Mr. Roper takes that plunger, shoves it squarely up her ass.  Yeah, they're going to do the Volpe.  Oh, fuck.  Right, thank you.  So Travis is going to get the Mike Vitti update,  because he was going to have to say something on his next show. 
[01:22:00]  Yeah.  Which happened this past weekend.  Oh, man.  Did Mike Vitti have to get on and apologize?  Well, I'm sure he wants to make sure everyone understands he had nothing to do with that.  He does a once-a-week show.  Yeah, it's his name.  Yeah.  I can't wait to hear.  I would be like, look, it wasn't me.  Is there a Mike Vitti update online?  Maybe he's just hoping it just goes away.  Wow, Fez Watley made Huffington Post, huh? 
[01:22:30]  Yes, sir.  Good for Fez.  Fez Watley.  How's that working out?  Comes out as gay on air on Ron and Fez.  Yeah?  He sounds a lot happier.  Yeah, she was great on the show Friday and today.  She?  I said he was great on the show Friday and today.  Oh, my God.  I swear to God, I thought you said she.  Can you rewind that?  I think you said she, too.  Yeah, I'm looking at him.  Sam.  Are you tired today, Sam?  No.  It's just a homophobe.  Yeah, it really is.  That's obvious.  I thought you said she.  I did, too.  I thought you did, too.  That's what I heard. 
[01:23:00]  I wasn't even going for a little...  Maybe my yes and he.  I don't know.  All right, here we go.  Wonk, wonk.  Oh.  He sounds a lot happier.  Yeah, she was great on the show Friday and...  That's she.  You said she.  That's she.  You said she.  Yes.  Have fun dealing with Fez today, Sam.  We can't have that kind of intolerance. 
[01:23:30]  Holy fuck.  Yeah, that's not the attitude of the Opie and Anthony program.  That's Sam Roberts.  Never has been.  Let me hear that again.  Yeah, please.  I want to make sure.  Here it is.  She sounds a lot happier.  Yeah, she was great on the show Friday and today.  She was great on the show.  Blatant homophobia.  That's fireable.  Wow.  We don't tolerate that here at SiriusXR.  Zero tolerance policy we have.  Especially with everybody selling off shares.  We don't tolerate that.  We don't tolerate that.  We don't tolerate that.  We're heading for the fire exits.  Wow, that's Sam's inner voice. 
[01:24:00]  Yep.  That should be fun on Ron and Fez today.  Yeah.  Oh boy.  I don't think they'll pull that or anything.  No, they won't be playing that.  No.  I don't think so.  And then Fez may say something like, well, if Sam wants to view me as a woman because  I have certain preferences, then Sam, he'll be right to be annoyed.  Good luck with that, Sam.  He's happier.  You know?  Yeah.  Or is it she, Sam?  Yeah, Sam.  It's he.  How would you like to comment on this?  How would you like to degrade him?  I'm the one who just told you he was happier.  What's the vibe around here? 
[01:24:30]  I heard something in there.  Everyone's selling their shares, huh?  I don't know.  I think it was a regulation they couldn't.  Mel, Scott, Pat Donnelly.  I don't know where the article's from, but they're selling a lot.  It's all public record.  Yeah.  A lot of people just selling shares.  Maybe they weren't allowed to.  They're just taking some profit.  Yeah.  So everyone's trying to speculate what that means, I guess.  Yeah.  I've been wondering.  Price has been going up a little bit.  They're probably just taking a little...  Some profits?  I know I would if I had fucking 30 million shares.  Oh, man.  Sell a bunch. 
[01:25:00]  I just sell a bunch of them.  That's a lot.  That's how you make money.  Yeah.  Yes, it is.  Gotta fucking trade stock.  Fuck this salary shit.  Womp, womp.  This guy sounds awful.  All right.  Let's go to Jim in Fresno.  Jim?  Hey, guys.  What's up?  Hey, guys.  What's up?  It's early.  Yep.  Or late.  Whichever.  Yep.  What's going on?  What did you call the show for today? 
[01:25:30]  What's the deal with...  You guys play homosexual sounds.  What happened?  You guys are playing homo sounds, man.  And dudes fucking each other in the ass.  And that's...  It's kind of, you know...  Makes me want to fucking take a nap.  So when you hear men fucking each other in the ass, it releases melatonin in your brain?  How does that happen? 
[01:26:00]  Whoa.  It makes me want to run and hide or something, man.  No, it doesn't.  What are you, a closeted gay person?  Yeah, it makes you want to throw your legs up in bunny rabbit position.  Hits a little too close to home?  Low?  Yeah, that's it.  You got it.  Hey, is Sam there?  Yes, sir.  Oh, yeah.  Yes, she is.  Someone is also saying Sam said Friday and today.  You're sleepy today.  Yeah, you said Friday and today.  They haven't even been on today.  Go back to that thing again. 
[01:26:30]  Hold on one second.  What's wrong with you, Sam?  Hold on one second, Fresno.  Hold on.  That podcast starts interfering with the program.  Absolutely.  It's all his other radio shows.  Yes.  His duties.  Yeah.  Let me hear that again, Iraq.  Did he say Friday and today?  He sounds a lot happier.  Yeah, she was great on the show Friday and today.  How do you know?  Today didn't happen yet.  You sound drunk.  Wow.  Are you drinking?  No.  You have pills?  What's going on?  You tired?  No.  You on the dope?  No.  I know you don't like showing weakness ever, but what's going on? 
[01:27:00]  A little tired.  Something's happened.  A little tired.  I was more tired yesterday than today.  Was there a big Raw event last night or something?  Oh, something.  I went to sleep at 10 o'clock last night.  All right.  Yeah, Sam's here, Jim.  What do you want to say to him?  What's for dinner tonight, Sam?  Which is 2006.  That's a good question.  What's for dinner tonight?  They'll probably have a chicken dish for dinner.  Chicken cutlets or chicken fingers or chicken. 
[01:27:30]  One of those options, yeah.  Something, right?  Yes.  Can you name all the chicken dishes you know, Jim?  Please.  I don't know, bro.  I think you could come up with 10 of them.  Let's go.  Chicken sandwich.  Yeah, that's one.  Chicken a la mode.  Chicken with ice cream.  Chicken with ice cream.  You'd stolt.  That's good, though.  That's two.  I want 10.  Go ahead, Jim.  Chicken and alcohol. 
[01:28:00]  All right.  Now you're just being silly.  All right.  Keep going.  Chicken and medical.  Chicken and something.  That counts.  Are you done, Jim?  No, not really.  I think that was a rhetorical question.  Yeah.  You guys need to fucking change your schedule to the West Coast so we can fucking enjoy you 
[01:28:30]  in a fucking sober state.  How was that?  I don't know.  All right, Jim.  You guys fucking rule, man.  All right, Jim.  Of course we do.  You should sleep in and just catch the replay.  Negative, negative.  It's not, you know.  I don't get to fucking, I don't get to spend too much in the daylight. 
[01:29:00]  What do you do for a living, Jim?  I'm a security guard.  Oh, Jesus.  Wow.  Yeah, I keep all the wetbacks away from my fucking property.  All right.  All right.  Can we move on now or are you good?  You good?  I'm fucking perfect, dude.  All right.  I'm perfect.  As long as you guys do a show tomorrow, we're ready to go.  How was our show tomorrow, Sam? 
[01:29:30]  It was a slip of the tongue.  I have no...  It was good?  How did the three ladies do, in your view?  You called Fez a shit.  That's not good.  That's pretty bad.  And the new Fez is going to...  He's not tolerating shit.  No.  He's not going to just sit there and cry.  He's going to fucking attack.  The new Fez is...  Hey, how about we get a fucking...  Hey.  Yeah.  How about we get another Bo and fucking David show going, man?  That would be a dream come true.  David and Bobo.  Yeah.  I miss those shows. 
[01:30:00]  They were amazing.  Remember how we hated them?  I loved it.  And now they roll.  Constantly.  I always loved that shit.  They were fun shows.  Terrible.  Problem is David doesn't acknowledge that he ever was here.  Oh, we can get that idiot back on.  I don't think so.  He runs away.  We can't even approach him at this point.  Whoa.  Whoa.  Whoa.  Whoa.  Or something.  Bring him back.  Watch him.  I shoot him with a fucking elephant dart and fucking drag him back to the fucking studio  and fucking wake him up or something. 
[01:30:30]  I got his fucking gold.  Are you on the weed?  What are you doing?  I'm ready to go.  But are you on weed?  What are you on right now?  I'm ready to go.  I'm gone.  I'm on the granddaddy perp.  Perks?  Granddaddy purple.  What's that?  It's some fucking, it's a shit you want to fucking smoke.  Type of weed.  Let's put it this way.  It's like fucking Jim Rogen says.  You just got to fucking smoke. 
[01:31:00]  Jim Rogen.  Jim Rogen.  And Joe and fucking deal with it.  You got to fucking adjust.  Yeah.  You're adjusting.  All right.  So I guess you did a little 420 because it's, uh, it's, uh, West Coast time.  It's fucking on.  I'm waiting for the sun to come up and fucking enjoying the show.  All right, brother.  We're going to, uh, head into commercials, I think.  Hey, tell them truck drivers. 
[01:31:30]  They're a bunch of pussies.  They're a bunch of Howard Stern fans.  I don't know.  We got a lot of fucking truckers listening to this show.  Oh, I know.  I'm a, I'm an ex, I'm an ex-trucker, but, uh.  Of course you are.  Yeah.  Who did you kill?  Not too many.  I don't know how to get out of this.  What did you do?  You just hang up on the guy?  I guess you just hang up on him.  All right.  I don't know.  What would usually get us out of something like this?  Hmm.  Happy birthday.  Ah.  Yeah.  We're out of here, Jim. 
[01:32:00]  Thank you.  Jimmy Fresno.  So, isn't this great boy?  Hmm.  I could have just played the opening. 
[01:32:30]  For Black History Month, the Opie and Anthony Show recognizes some of the individuals whose 
[01:33:00]  contributions have shaped the African-American community and changed all of us for the better.  Today, we honor the Reverend Al Sharpton.  Reverend Al changed the face of black culture as we know it, when he made it clear that  just because you have a past littered with instances of racism, doesn't mean you can't  demonize others for doing the same thing.  As far as Reverend Al has gone, he has never forgotten where he came from, or how hungry  he is.  You know, I grew up here in Brooklyn, and we used to come home from school. 
[01:33:30]  My mother, some of the ladies in the neighborhood would make blueberry pie, and we would rush in  knowing our mothers were still working.  And we'd eat.  They'd come in.  Did y'all eat the pie?  No.  And blueberry would be all over our face.  That's what happens when I look at the GOP.  They talk about the economy's bad.  And we didn't do it.  We were the ones fighting.  But they got the blueberry pie all over their face.  They were the ones eating the pie.  Thanks, Reverend Al, for proving that hypocrisy has no skin color. 
[01:34:00]  Stay tuned as we continue to recognize significant African-American contributions for Black History  Month here on the Opie and Anthony Show.  You're listening to Opie and Anthony.  Sirius XM.  And now a reading from the book of Ted.  When the wine was gone, Ted had his disciples fill the drugs with water.  And then a miracle occurred.  And Ted said,  I took water and I turned it into crystal light. 
[01:34:30]  The wine was now crystal light.  When the food was gone, Ted's disciples gathered.  And the Lord Ted proclaimed,  I took a bunch of fishes and turned them into more fishes by cutting them in half.  I had 30 fishes and I should present E with 60 half-fishes.  It was the second miracle Ted had performed.  And Ted then divided the fish among them.  I'm working miracles!  The king was not impressed and ordered Ted to be arrested.  Oh no!  They misunderstood me!  Ted shouted as he tried to explain himself. 
[01:35:00]  I had an erection!  It was tending out of my robe beautifully!  But the guards just ignored him.  And Ted was taken away.  The Lord Ted was to be crucified.  Ow!  My hands and feet are hurting!  Ted shouted as the nails were driven into his flesh.  As the crowd looked on, Ted looked to the people and announced,  I have it!  I have it!  It's not!  You go with thorns!  Whatever that means,  this has been a reading from the book of Ted.  It's now time for 
[01:35:30]  Masturbation Memories  with Jim Jeffries.  My mother came and grabbed the duvet  and I was holding on to this.  This is 300 pounds of misery.  My mom, right?  She's bending right back.  And then I had one choice because I was naked.  It was the middle of the day, right?  Fucking 110 degrees of Australian heat,  like in your measurement, right?  I'm sitting under my bed having a wake.  When my mom walks in the room,  I throw the magazine down the side of the bed  in one motion just...  And she goes,  clean this fucking room up!  And she goes,  why are you laying in your bed?  I'm like, 
[01:36:00]  you know, just having a nap,  you know?  And she just goes,  well, get up now!  And she goes,  why are you getting up?  I said,  well, get up!  Can you get the fuck out?  She starts pulling on my duvet.  My erection strengthens.  She's pulling on my duvet.  I'm panicking like,  oh, fuck!  And I'm going,  please, mom!  Please, mom, no!  And I had to make a decision, right?  She's a big woman.  I had to make a decision.  I let go of the duvet.  She goes flying backwards into the cupboard 
[01:36:30]  and I flip onto my stomach  as quick as possible.  Yeah, so I've still got this sweaty,  fucking bald ass sticking up  and a 300-pound mom crying  and falling on the ground.  Things couldn't have gone worse.  Anyway, enough about me.  Back to the retards.  And that was your  masturbation memory  for the Opie and Anthony Show.  He was banging cocktail waitresses  two at a time.  Players couldn't get a drink at the table.  Mike! 
[01:37:00]  You don't come to Las Vegas  to talk to a man like  Mo Green, like  that!  Mo Green!  Mo Green!  Mo Green!  Like that!  Like that!  Like that!  Like that!  This is Brian Cox. 
[01:37:30]  Hey, this is Chaz Palmaturi.  Hey, this is Danny McFryde.  Hey, this is David DeCupis.  Hey, this is Michael Madsen.  You're listening to  Opie and Anthony.  I don't know why,  but I'm still trying to figure out  what the hell the show's about.  Good old Michael Madsen.  Oh, that's who that was, right.  Right, right. 
[01:38:00]  Right, right, right, right.  Laszlo in the studio.  It's been a while.  Les.  Yeah.  Good morning, Laszlo.  Last time I was here,  I was with Patrice.  It was that long ago.  Wow, yeah.  Really?  Damn, that's right.  That's a long time ago.  Yeah.  What the hell have you been up to?  You're traveling the world?  Yeah, I'm traveling a lot.  And I think I saw you guys  at Patrice's funeral.  Have you talked about how  Voss bombed at that funeral?  Oh, God, when he went up  to give a little eulogy.  It was amazing when Jim gave his speech 
[01:38:30]  and other people went up there.  It's like everybody was crying through tears.  And then Voss came up  and I was like,  oh, he's losing me.  He's losing me.  Oh, my God.  At a funeral?  Yeah, what's wrong with you?  Yeah.  That was a weird thing  because it was like funny.  Everybody,  most of the guys  that were getting up there,  you know,  they were funny  because they're comics.  But then you're like,  oh, I'm here for this.  I thought Voss did well, actually. 
[01:39:00]  What was your problem  with Voss at Patrice's funeral?  I just, I don't know.  I wasn't laughing as hard  as the other guys.  He wasn't getting as many laughs  as the other guys.  Oh, I see.  It was a funeral.  Oh, my God.  That was such a weird affair, too,  because I kept waiting  for there to be like a joke.  Like, I kept waiting  for him to jump up  and be like,  ha-ha, motherfucker.  Yeah, yeah.  But just,  it was so,  it was fucking surreal.  Yeah, because there were  some funny moments.  So it was like,  ah, you don't want to go back  to the tragedy  of the whole thing.  Yeah. 
[01:39:30]  Yeah.  I went out with,  hung out with Bob Kelly  the other day  and we talked about Patrice  like the whole time.  Yeah.  And I took Bobby  to like a Korean restaurant  and to watch a fat person  try to use chopsticks  is the funniest shit  in the world.  It's like a wood chipper.  Dude, it's like,  you know when you hand,  you know when you hand something  to a baby  and their fat fingers  just wrap around it  and then they just drop it  on the floor?  Yeah.  He did that with chopsticks  several times  and the guy had to keep  coming over  and bringing him new chopsticks.  He doesn't know  how to use chopsticks.  Well, the other thing 
[01:40:00]  that's funny  about a fat person  using chopsticks  is that frustration  on their face  that they're not able  to like shovel the food  get as much in  fast enough  as fast.  Did he go for the fork  or the spoon?  No.  He stuck with it.  He stuck with the chopsticks.  He stuck with it.  I used to try to be a purist  with chopsticks  but when you're dealing  with like fried rice  I don't have to fucking  I'd say,  why am I doing this?  Why am I just putting  two sticks worth  of rice in my face?  Get a fork.  Hey, I have to ask  Korean food good?  I don't know  if I've ever had Korean food.  Yeah. 
[01:40:30]  They have this thing  called a bib and bab  which is like this  hot iron bowl  that they throw  a bunch of stuff in  and it cooks  in front of you  kind of like  that shit at Chili's.  Yeah, yeah.  You know when they bring out  and you're scalding yourself.  It's like,  why am I?  That's Korean fajitas?  Yeah.  It's Korean Chili's.  Is it like Chinese food?  Yeah, sort of.  And they throw a raw egg  in the middle of it  and it cooks in the  It cooks.  It's fantastic.  It cooks inside  the little thing.  I don't know.  I think I had  Korean food once. 
[01:41:00]  Yeah, you still  haven't explained it.  It's just a bunch of  What's the difference  between Chinese food  which most of us know  and Korean food  which a lot of us  I don't think have had?  A little bit more anger  in the Korean food.  It's more of a lot  more beef and stuff, right?  Yeah.  Like I had  I went to Korean barbecue recently.  It was good.  Yeah.  It wasn't amazing  but it was good.  I got like a dried fish  thrown in front of me.  It was an entire fish  eyes, head, the whole thing  just dried up  and I was supposed to  pick that with chopsticks  and then that kimchi shit 
[01:41:30]  that cabbage-y fucking  Oh, that's good.  Why would you get fish  at a Korean restaurant?  I don't know.  Maybe a Greek restaurant.  I didn't know what I wanted.  You like Vietnamese?  Vietnamese is good.  I like that Vietnamese food.  That's my favorite  out of the Asian food groups.  You know, when you go  through Chinatown  in this city  you see all that shit  out on the street.  I'm like, who eats this?  There's like 800 kinds  of mushrooms  and they've got like  fish parts  Hanging ducks upside down  It's really  They're dried  It's really weird  and everything is supposed 
[01:42:00]  to, you know, cure  They all smoke  so it obviously fucking works  because they live to 110  I'll tell you one thing  it doesn't cure in Chinatown  walking in front of trucks  with fucking vehicles  Boy, those old Asian people  love getting hit by cars  Really?  Yeah, when you read  about like  the highways of death  around New York  They're always in like  Flushing, Queens  Queens Boulevard  Asian areas  Yeah, like Asians  for some reason  and you drive down  by Chinatown 
[01:42:30]  it's crazy  because they'll walk  right out in the fucking street  They'll just shuffle  right out in front of your car  Meep!  I'm beeping the horn  and they don't care  They got places to be  Apparently so  But they eat healthy  and chain smoke  That looks like shit  Who would eat that?  That's fantastic  That's a plate of  That's what you had?  Yeah  So what is all that shit?  What's the wormy stuff?  Sesame seeds  And that's not lo mein  I see bean sprouts  I see the bean sprouts  I see some mushrooms 
[01:43:00]  A lot of cabbage  I see worms  Ah, cabbage stinks  Cabbage is terrible  Horrible  Yeah, they love their cabbage  those Koreans  Cabbage sucks  That's about  And the raw egg  in the middle  Flirting with disaster  at all times  Oh, man  I think it's cooked  No, it's raw  It cooks in the bottom  of the bowl  because this bowl's hot  But how can it cook  when it's sitting  on top of everything?  Because they haven't  mixed it up yet  You're supposed to  Oh, so the egg  will be kind of cooked  by the time you eat it  I went to one of those  Japanese barbecues  last week  It takes like  two and a half hours  to fucking  because you're 
[01:43:30]  cooking your own food  Yeah, it's so stupid  It's the dumbest  There's that little  There's like a grill  in the middle of the table  A hibachi  Because somebody at Rockstar  is like  let's go get  Japanese barbecue  and I thought  awesome  we'll go pick something up  and come back  But no  two and a half hours  I'm sitting there  watching food cook  slowly  I've had that  They give you  a cooking lesson  I'm like  this is the whole reason  I'm here  I don't want to cook  All this raw shit  I could have done this  at home  Yeah, what the fuck  They explain it to you  two minutes  then make sure  you turn it over  I'm like  I don't want to have to  worry about cooking  my own food  How about you do it? 
[01:44:00]  This isn't fun  Right  I had a Korean barbecue  like that  where Bob Kelly  was cooking  No, he cooked  One guy does the meat  Oh God  he was that guy  I didn't want to do it  In the restaurant  On the table  Yeah, you cook it  on the table  Why is that fun?  What's fun about that?  Can I come do the dishes?  I don't mind  I don't mind  going to Benihana's  or whatever  and watching them  cook the shit  That's kind of fun  every once in a while  They're going to do  an onion volcano  I'm fucking in  Oh, I'm in  If I could pound beers  while you're making  flames shoot out of  a volcano 
[01:44:30]  And they flip that shrimp  and you got to catch it  In the hat  They don't do any  of that fire shit  on the boat though  I went to the  Tapinaki  Tapinaki place  on the boat  Yeah  And no fire  No volcano  So what do they do?  They just kind of  you know  do that  knocking everything around  but they don't do  anything with fire  Of course not  They leave everything  Yeah, no open flames  on the ship  That's too bad  Yeah  Yeah  That's too bad, man  I know  Although they did have  two huge barbecue grills  out on the main deck 
[01:45:00]  and they were cooking  like a bunch of shit  on there  And then you should  see the ritual  they used to put  the coals out  Yeah  Like throwing ice cubes  on the grill  and letting them melt down  onto the coals  And then again  they just keep doing it  and they douse it  with water  Because what  Why don't they just  throw the whole thing  overboard  Just throw it off  There's a lot of water  Boy, the old days  used to be able to do that  I'm sure the old days  they, yeah  I was watching these  dumb documentaries  because there's  nothing really else  on the TV  when the weather  is a little amiss 
[01:45:30]  And they're just  showing how everything  works on the ships  And they have a complete  like water purification  system going on there  The trash compactors  And then they burn it  in an incinerator  And then they pack  the ash up  And then when they go to  Sure they do  But they  They do that a little bit  I bet you  But they have to  Like they've been caught  and fined huge  millions  Why who?  Millions of  The environmental  Yeah  Yeah there's actually  something that oversees 
[01:46:00]  the shipping garbage  I guarantee the ship  being thrown overboard  all the time  Yeah I was on a ship  in Greece last year  and they had this huge sign  that dictated how far away  from land you had to be  to throw certain stuff overboard  I mean they had everything  Bodies  Dude everything  Really?  Cars  Where'd you go in Greece?  Cars?  I was around Icaria  and off the coast of Turkey  and this boat  this ferry that we were on  was really beat down 
[01:46:30]  and busted  and it was old as shit  and I didn't  I don't think that they  they remembered  that this sign was out  but dude  like not that far from land  you can just be dumping  all sorts of garbage  off the side of a boat  Really?  Yeah  You walk around Istanbul?  I have done Istanbul  Fuck is that amazing  I don't  I wouldn't want to live there  but it was crazy to check out  What'd you do?  Did you just go there?  Did you go to the Blue Mosque?  Well I went to Turkey  like two or three years ago  but this time I just  It needed the money  hopped around a few  a few Greek islands 
[01:47:00]  Chios and Samos  and Homos  Homos  Santorini?  They've renamed Lesbos  I think  They renamed Lesbos  The Lesbian Island?  Yeah  I'm brought to be a Lesbion  A Lesbian  from a Lesbos  I forgot that clip  Santorini or Mykonos?  Yeah I've done those in the past  Creek?  No  My big trip  I liked my Greek islands  I want to go back  What do you do?  Just hang out?  Yeah I rent like a house 
[01:47:30]  on the water  Where?  Just anywhere  on those Greek islands  You can rent an entire house  for nothing  Their economy's fucked  The people are writing  right into the streets  You can have a house  for fucking $500  for the week  They're also going to try  to knock you over the head  with a hard object  and take everything on you  That's the other side of it  They fucking complain  over there  about how fucked  their government is  but not one of them  pays fucking taxes  Really?  You can't use a credit card  fucking anywhere  They want cash  Is that what the deal is?  They don't pay taxes  for shit  You walk around Athens? 
[01:48:00]  Fuck no  Dude there's people  burning shit in the streets  and I stay the fuck away  I went  No I went like  10, 11 years ago  Athens is amazing  See where the first Olympics was  and all the fucking ruins  Fuck the Olympics  I hate the Olympics now  You didn't want to check out  some ruins  That's the thing about  when you go to Greece  or Turkey  They're making new ruins  There's fucking ruins everywhere  You get tired  like oh look  it's columns that have  fallen over from a long time ago  But it's weird  they can't touch that shit  so when they're  modernizing Athens 
[01:48:30]  they build around everything  They build around all that shit  All of a sudden there'll be  just a glass wall  where you can look at  other ruins in the middle  of a hotel  because they weren't  allowed to touch it  Oh really?  Oh yeah  Oh really?  That's kind of cool  It's really cool  Atrium  I remember a hotel  I was in  I was going down an escalator  and the whole side  was a wall  a glass wall  where you could see  just ruins  and they built a hotel  around it  But Athens is dangerous  right now probably  Oh I'm sure  So is all these islands  The Acropolis  was amazing to check out  And I don't understand  why my fucking  stock portfolio  keeps going into the shitter 
[01:49:00]  and the main headline  is because of Greece  Yeah what does that have to do?  What is  What are you invested in diners?  I don't fucking get it  It doesn't make any sense  And I call my investment guy  I'm like  why am I losing money?  Well you know  there's a lot of shit going on  I don't give a fuck about Greece  You needed to bet  against the euro  like we did  Yeah you did  Short that euro  Short the shit out of that euro  Yeah we ended up doing alright  We got a guy for you  Really?  You got a guy?  We got us  one of them Jews  He called us up one day 
[01:49:30]  He's like  we're gonna bet  against the euro  I'm like alright  Let it rip  Let's bet against the euro then  Yeah  We're taking a chance  it's not gonna come back  anytime soon  Is he the same guy  that got you into Citadel?  No  That's when we went rogue  Citadel  Yeah that was our own  That was the only time  I went rogue  That was our own  We did our own  you know  our own research  Hundred and  what was it?  What is it?  Hundred and twenty thousand  done  Yeah  Something like that  Done  Zero  Zero  Zero 
[01:50:00]  Well you could write it off  in your taxes I suppose  Apparently  I guess  We might have years ago  I don't even know  No idea  See that's why I got out  of that game  Because when I was doing  the technophile  I would learn about  these tech companies  and stuff  Jump in  And I'd jump in  Oh shit  And I did okay  on a few  and then bath time  Didn't we all  We did okay  It was bath time  That's why the stock market  is brilliant  because it plays off the fact  that no one ever wants to sell  Not no one 
[01:50:30]  but the masses  That's true  You hold it right  You want to hold it  It'll always go up  Because you see it doing well  and you're like  Well if it's doing well now  it's going to do even better  And that's where they get you  every fucking time man  And that  You know  The majority of us  do that shit  You're afraid  you're going to sell something  Dude  Citadel went up  the first week or two  a couple bucks  We should have got out  We would have had a nice  little quick profit  We said fuck that  You're afraid  I bought Sirius very cheap  and it's up to  two something  two twenty five  now  I made a nice piece of money on it  but a part of me is like 
[01:51:00]  no because I'll sell it  and I'll make a decision  Right  And it'll go to  eleven fifty a share  and I'm just afraid to do that  I mean you just got to think  of the money you would have made  Yeah  But you got to think  of the money you made  How about Citadel  We watched it click down  and we're like  nope  I refuse to take  You could have got out  with a ten thousand dollar loss  Oh yeah  Twenty thousand dollars  Why do that  when you could have  a hundred and twenty thousand dollar loss  Because you're sitting there  going well  it's going to come back  Right  Eventually  Did it  Bankrupt  They went bankrupt  And once they're bankrupt  they all 
[01:51:30]  You're done  You stock  they own nothing for it  They don't have to  they don't have to pay  the stockholders  But then when they resell the stock  again  they don't go back  to the old stockholders  No  Wouldn't that be nice  How the fuck does that work  Exactly  That's such horse shit  Fucking one percenters  No but how is a fucking  declaring bankruptcy  relieve you of all debt  and then when you are  unbankrupt  you fucking  because the government  gets  do they get their tax money  when you declare bankruptcy  Oh  I don't 
[01:52:00]  I don't know  I would like to know  if you owe a lot of money  in taxes  and you say  I'm bankrupt  now for seven years  it's going to fuck your credit up  and all that stuff  but does the government  get the back taxes  you owe  when you start making money  and if so  why don't the fucking  stockholders  get the money  that they lost  when the company  went belly up  They're the guys  that get shit on  the stockholders  They're the ones  that just get  Why does the government  get their fucking piece  Why do they get their money  if that's true  I don't know  why I'm asking  We don't know  It's the same reason 
[01:52:30]  that billionaires  pay 13% fucking tax  It's not rigged  for you  Well they should  Oh here we go  Not a 13%  Buffett doesn't pay  He's got to pay more  Buffett should pay more  percentage wise  He knows that  I mean it's just  It's silly  A lot of these guys  make their money  off of investments  and other things  on money that has  already been taxed  That's why  it's like  so you invest in  the market  you invest in whatever  you make some more money  you shouldn't have to pay  50% tax on that money too 
[01:53:00]  you already fucking  the money you invested  was taxed  and you're risking it  so you might even lose that  so you make the money  yeah you're still  paying taxes on it  but I'm paying taxes  on taxed money  you fuckers  And here we are  at the furious  billionaire hour again  Yes  That is a good point  The system is broke  They do keep taxing you  It is busted  Hey you want to talk  to a Greek guy  that's going to explain that  You can walk around Greece  and it's not dangerous  Sure  Are you crazy  Well not dangerous  Guy with ass hair  You're on the  Open Open Show  We watch TV 
[01:53:30]  Tommy the Greek  What do you got buddy?  Good morning guys  Hey  Say you were living in Greece  and all you saw  was Occupy Wall Street  You'd think New York  was going crazy too  It's just a little section  of Athens  a little  you know like  a two square block  where they're protesting  and going nuts  Greece is safe  and as far as  taxes and stuff  you know  we were brought up here  in an English  way of 
[01:54:00]  taxation  where in England  you don't own  the property  the land  you know  and you pay tax  to the queen  In Greece  that house is yours  the land under it's yours  there was never any taxing  Yeah I kind of like that  Yeah  I like it too  We don't really own our houses  we've talked about that many times  Good don't pay your taxes  You bought your house  you paid it off  now don't pay your taxes  and see if you own  your fucking house 
[01:54:30]  Exactly  Coxsackies  Well it's in Greece  you know I mean  that's why they go crazy  when they talk about taxes  because you know  we don't do that  Is Greece going to turn around  or what?  I don't know  Turn around  Greece  get it?  That's an ass fuck joke  Is that good or bad?  That's pretty good  Fuck  I think that's bad for us then  We're betting against the euro  I hope the euro tanks  I do too  I hate the euro  It's a piece of garbage 
[01:55:00]  Our investments depend on  Greece failing  That's so fucking bad  Yeah come on Greece  Fail  No I think it'll hurt  it'll hurt us for some reason  when Greece takes it  in the fucking face  it does affect  the whole world  Of course  but might as well  make money  on the way  I like the old days  of the fucking  Deutschmark  and the Frank  and all that  fucking wacky money  that was all over Europe  I don't like this  United bullshit  Is Germany pulling out  of the  countries are getting  very tired of that 
[01:55:30]  fucking euro  because they're sick  of other shit countries  weighing down their economy  Bringing it down  That's what you get  Germany  Why the fuck  would you be involved  with that?  England was smart  England wanted nothing  to do with the euro  Yes  The British pound  is fucking  That's a great piece  of money  They love that money  I'd love to have  some British pounds  and wave them  Yay  But it is true  It's like  why should a country  that's doing very well  have to be saddled  with the burden  of another country  just because you  share a currency  You know that's like  imagine us  having to share currency 
[01:56:00]  with fucking Mexico  No it's our  It's same here  except it's Alabama  and Mississippi  Well that's true  Okay  Stakes that take  way more dollars  than they contribute  to the economy  That's what's going on  You make a good point  there  We're like  mini Europe  over here  It's like my father  would say  use your head  for something  other than a hat rack  That's a good one  You would say that  You also say  use elbow grease  No  Fist grease  Jesus  You know  Chris in Chicago  70% of the taxes  are paid by the top 1% 
[01:56:30]  Yeah I know that  Laszlo  What else  you been doing man  Went to  Brazil  Oh  How was that  First time  Yeah  That was  That was very interesting  For hookers  No  That's all I know  about Brazil  We're working on a game  No we didn't go to Rio  We went to Sao Paulo  I've never been there  What's the difference  between Rio and Sao Paulo  Rio is where you go  for hookers  and party  and  Carnival  Sao Paulo is where you go  if you're a Nazi  running from the JDL 
[01:57:00]  Dude I was surprised  how many Germans  were down there  I walked into a German restaurant  and I was like  wowza  Dude that's all about  when  at the end of World War 2  a lot of Germans  got the fuck out of Dodge  and went to Brazil  went to Sao Paulo  Yeah  Nazis  and just you know  your standard German people  What's the difference  between the two cities?  Well  Sao Paulo is more the capital  and sort of the  you know  the main  place of business  There's only 24 million people  That's a big fucking city 
[01:57:30]  Dude it is the third largest city  in the world  and we were flying into it  it's just  you know in New York City  where you have really tall buildings  and then the farther you go out  the buildings get smaller and smaller  Yeah  There it's just big buildings  everywhere  Really?  And there's no zoning laws  so you'll have like  Holy shit  Is this it?  Yes  So you'll have  That's like SimCity gone mad  Holy fuck  That's when you're playing SimCity  and you finally go  ah fuck it  I'm turning the computer off  Wow  And there'll be an enormous 
[01:58:00]  enormous rich building  because the amount of money  in that city  is unbelievable  and the amount of poverty  is equally as insane  You'll have a  this razor-wired  super complex  and right next door  are favelas  and people making homes  out of like  pieces of construction debris  It was unbelievable  Wow  Now what about  Did you feel safe there?  Because in Brazil  you got  it's like  they are so poor  you have people  always begging you for money  and there's always this  really weird  possible danger 
[01:58:30]  Well when we flew in  we were instructed  to get a bulletproof car  Really?  Yeah because I had  about 10 grand  worth of cash on me  because we went down there  to record for Max Payne 3  and we've been going down  to Brazil  Why do you have to go down there  to do that?  Well a lot of video games  when they're set  in a foreign location  when you're running around  fighting enemies  all of the bad guys  speak in like  broken English  my favorite ones 
[01:59:00]  are the military ones  where they're like  you know  he's coming comrade  it's like why  if we're in a gun battle  why are you speaking  English  so I can understand  I'm reloading  cover me  you know  and it's all these  terrible accents  and it sounds so cartoony  so since Max Payne 3  is set in Sao Paulo  we went down there  and recorded  a bunch of people  dozens and dozens  of people  so that  Oh you record them  in a studio  Yeah I record them  in a studio  I didn't know  they're giving you  a good recording  Well because we have 
[01:59:30]  translators there  you know with us  but  but it's so that  when you're playing the game  that there's authentic  you know Portuguese  being screamed at you  while the guy's  trying to shoot you  in the face  Now do you  now do that  they'll buy that game  there right  will that game  sell well in Brazil  you think  Hope so  Do other games  sell well there  Well you know  Central and South America  have a huge  have a huge piracy issue  because video games  video games  and you talk about taxes  video games in Brazil  a game here 
[02:00:00]  that costs $60  costs about $110 there  Why?  Because if it's not  manufactured in the country  they slap a huge tax on it  and that's  and it's  actually in a weird way  it's very smart  Yeah we should do that  I have to tell you  if you want to make a  like we were riding around  later on in this  you know Ford car  or whatever  it's made in Brazil  and so all these companies  if you want to  sell to the third largest city  in the world  and plus you know  all the other  I mean it's a massive country 
[02:00:30]  Open a plant right  You gotta open a plant  and it creates jobs  and you know  I started thinking like  about all the horse shit  that we just bring over  from overseas  Yeah  I was like  you know maybe that's  what we should do  Tax the shit out of China  Tax it really high  and then fuck  tax it high  President Trump said  something like that  25% tax  but it was a point  because then you fucking  make those Chinese companies  come here  open a plant  so American workers  are making these Chinese products  that makes sense  You know it disgusted me  how Apple was talking shit  about actually making anything 
[02:01:00]  in the United States  if they were to take  one product  and make it in Detroit  they could fucking  help turn that city around  but you know  there's been all these people  saying why don't you  make anything here  and they say oh you know  the workers are so much  more flexible in China  you're like  we change the screen  on the iPhone  and they you know  we go around to the dormitories  and knock and wake people up  who had just got off shift  and make them come back to work  like yeah  yeah yeah  it's because that's fucking inhumane  Americans wouldn't put up  with that shit  first off  having to live in a dorm  by work  that fucking blows  the only problem is though  would Americans be willing 
[02:01:30]  to pay a lot more money  because again  with unions and stuff  fucking  it's going to be  a lot more expensive  to make  and the labor's  a lot more expensive  and the product  will be more expensive  so what like  as a company  what do you do  I'm just playing devil's advocate  but what do you do  because you're going to have  to charge  instead of $400 for an iPhone  you have to charge  $650 or $700  see I don't buy that  because Apple's now  the largest company  in the world  aren't they  one of them  yeah  I mean  dude  they're making mad cash  on everything  they're not  they're not making like  $20 on each iPhone  they're making a wee bit more 
[02:02:00]  yeah yeah  but they don't want to give up  let's say they give up  a big piece of that profit  by paying  again this is going to be  their argument  the stock is going to go down  because the profit margin  is going to be lower  because instead of paying  fucking $1.50 to a guy  they got to pay $25  for an hour  so they're like  we're going to lose that money  for the same thing  we'll cut that on shipping  who gives a shit  that's their thinking  it just concerns me  because you know  a place without  strong manufacturing  yeah  nose dives  I mean look at Germany  they've got tons of manufacturing 
[02:02:30]  they've seemed to figure out  how to keep  you know  a middle class  that's happy  and  right  has jobs  as opposed to here  where it's like  all we have is the service industry  and we used to have that  we used to have  in the 50s  and the 40s  and we built a lot of shit  oh the good old days  yeah the cars  and everything was coming from here  water fountains  when people kept to themselves  and to their own kind  we're fucking the middle class  at this point in this country  but what's the answer though  I don't know what the answer is  but it's tough  it's not good  because the middle class needs to work  and they need to fucking make things  but 
[02:03:00]  it's so much cheaper to buy shit  that's made in other places  when you look at some of those unions  I mean  the perfect example  the Long Island Railroad  which I wrote in on this morning  has cut their service  like crazy  there's not as many trains  they raised rates by 25%  and meanwhile  like 90 something percent  of their employees  go out on disability  oh yeah  on the taxpayers  fucking dime  because you can  it's easy to  and they get a $100,000 salary  for the rest of their lives  right  it's insanity 
[02:03:30]  you'd be crazy  to not go out on disability  it's like  why wouldn't you  it's totally available to you  no one questions it  oh yeah my back  and then they just  punching tickets  I fucked my back  whacked out  just don't get caught bowling  yeah yeah  don't get caught bowling  or playing golf  yeah  gotta be careful with that stuff  plenty of those people around  what'd you do while you were down there  I love when you go to these countries  and bring back stories  we went down there to  we get picked up  we went down there to record  a bunch of stuff for Max Payne 3  and we've taken other trips down there 
[02:04:00]  which I wasn't on any of those  but  we show up  and  they  before we even go  there's like a security consultant  that's like  gets in touch with me  and he sends me the picture  of our driver  right  cause kidnapping  is such a hoo-ha  down there  you know  before I go  all these people are like  dude really  seriously  I'm not fucking around  be careful  I'm like  where the fuck am I going  what the fuck  don't wear a watch  don't wear a good watch  wear a cheap plastic watch  take the watch  put it up your ass  they're like  don't  don't look at your Blackberry 
[02:04:30]  or your iPhone  I thought this was safer than Rio  it looks like a modernized city  except for the little shanty towns  you're not seeing the crackheads  go to street level  take it to street level yo  but  so  so right before I leave  the security guy  contacts me and says  there's a different driver now  we're very worried  and  let us get back to you  I'm like  what the fuck  it's the old driver switcheroo  and so 
[02:05:00]  the old driver switcheroo  and they're really worried about this  dude  bugging out  that's fucking crazy  in America  where we go  where's whatever  oh I don't know  he called in sick  so I'm gonna drive you  from the airport  yeah  now he called in sick  he's had a cold all winter  oh yeah  have some brandy  so  we didn't work on the Godfather either  we saw it happen  so wait  the security guy was with you  no no no  the security guy  we're just in touch with  he provides security for  um  many like rock star  take two  kind of 
[02:05:30]  people that are going into  because we go into dodgy places  sure  and when did he know  that the driver was different  so he got contacted  by the  the company  down there  that he works with  uh  and then he  contacts me  while we're still at the airport  to fly  and here's the other thing  as a dumb American  that I didn't realize  it is a long time  to get to South America  fucking nine hours  well every time I go to the  Caribbean and places like that  I'm like  that was a short flight  you know  you just think it's all  it's all that area  it's all that area  and it's like  really 11 hours on a plane  what the fuck  holy fuck 
[02:06:00]  so uh  and the other thing  that's weird is  you know  you're used to flying  one direction  towards Europe  or south  towards the Caribbean  or something  you're flying in the  weirdest direction  across the ocean  when you're watching  the little map  on the plane  and  oh because like  the curvature  of the earth  you'd think you'd go  down like over Mexico  right  and then straight down  but you gotta kinda  curve out  and back in again  so  so we  we  we show up at the airport  which is hot as balls 
[02:06:30]  and  uh  the driver  you know  I'm holding the picture up  and it's the picture  sort of looks like him  but he's  you know  put on a little weight  I'm like  oh my god  and  so  we get in  and I ask if I can  roll down the window  and he gets really moody  he's like  there's no rolling down  the window here sir  I was like  all right  uh  I said  you know  and the glass dude  is like that  bank teller glass  you know  like I can see why  you can't fucking  roll the window down  and uh  I said  so this is bulletproof glass 
[02:07:00]  and he said  he tells me  that the whole car  he said  you have to be worried  about people  just putting a gun  on top of the car  and pulling a trigger  and shooting a bullet  straight down  through your head  uh  so that part  is bulletproof as well  um  and then he informed me  that in case somebody  puts a bomb  under the car  while we're  on the way  to the hotel  that the undercarriage  will keep me  from getting my legs  blown off  and stuff  oh that's nice to know  this is a really  relaxing city  why do all you guys 
[02:07:30]  in the car  sit on your helmets  so we  we uh  so I have to go to the bank  to change uh  American dollars  into  Brazilian reals  yeah  you didn't want to do it  at the airport  was the rate exchange  shitty there  um  they just  they told us  that  the  for security reasons  they wanted to drive us  to a bank  and the  the banks down there  dude  are a fucking trip  you can't get in  you have to go through a  a rotating door 
[02:08:00]  um  and it's a metal detector  so  you know  we're used to revolving doors  dude I  I'm like  I'm walking through  the fucking  bank front door  and the door goes slam  I've smashed my face into it  and then there's people  like screaming Portuguese  at me  that I've got metal on me  so you actually have to  shove all your stuff  through this little window  this is to get in the bank  holy shit  that's crazy  the driver had to case  the outside of the bank  for us  um  because a lot of robberies  happen right outside the bank  and the security guards 
[02:08:30]  at the bank  they don't give a fuck  like they are not coming outside  to help your ass  yeah  cause it's all  you know again  bulletproof  they just care about  what's happening in there  so  so we get inside  and they take us off  to this special room  it's the wild west  it's crazy  and this woman  comes back  and she looks really nervous  she says  there's a man out there  asking for two Americans  I'm like  oh here's where it  fucking goes down dude  and I haven't slept  cause we've flown  all fucking night  and  you were in a video game  it dude  it was  that's fucking like  you were in the game 
[02:09:00]  Rio  make a withdrawal  what was weird about  going from the airport  to the bank  in Sao Paulo  is there's  you know  we've already modeled  a bunch of the city  in the game  and I was like  looking out the window  I was like  fuck man  there's a level  right over there  I know that road  and so  she comes back  and says  oh actually  you know  it's just your driver  he was getting nervous  that you'd been  inside too long  so then I get  all this money  and  he makes us wait  by the front door  and he goes 
[02:09:30]  and cases the outside again  and pulls the front  the car  like right up  to the front door  and he's like  you run  to the car  I'm like  really  oh man  dude I'm  at this point  I'm like  what are we doing  we're going  all this effort  for a video game  so what happens  you get  you run  you run to the car  he's obviously armed  yeah  and so  anyway  then we  he takes us  to the hotel  makes sure  that everything's cool  and then  they wanted to  provide security  for us 
[02:10:00]  the rest of time  and I was like  no we have  a producer down there  and so the rest  of the week  I'm riding around  like a Ford Focus  no security  no security  just trying to keep  everything on  the DL  you know  not flashing  fancy phones  or whatever  but it's an amazing city  the people are  that we met  and hung out with  were really cool  and it's  it's such a  it's like  there's more  helicopter traffic  in that city  than any other city  in the world  because the traffic  is so fucked up  that people just  take helicopters  from place to place 
[02:10:30]  did you take any  no  dude I'm scared  to death of helicopters  I wonder how much  they cost  are they cheap  plus there's a lot  of people  that don't want  to get robbed  so they want to go  they want to land  on the top of the  building where they  live or whatever  so it's probably  expensive  they probably  take advantage  just walk around  just walk around  with like wads  of cash in your hand  I have so much money  just count it  in the street  I'm so rich  I'm so rich  in this city  this is great  my god  I'm American  right  I have rich family  members at home  we'd be driving  to the studio 
[02:11:00]  and you'd sort of  go through this weird  checkpoint of guys  with literally  fingers on machine guns  yeah  it's like oof  did you walk  into a favela  they have tours  I didn't do one  when I went  no  a bunch of rock star  guys have gone  through the favelas  because they wanted  to make it authentic  for the game  and what do they do  do they film in there  oh yeah  how do they do that  without the bag  you have to make a deal  with the local drug dealer  oh yeah  really  you gotta pay off  the local gang  enough money  and say  you know  we're gonna be  bringing these people in  they wanna look around  and take some pictures  so that we can make 
[02:11:30]  a video game  back in North America  trust me  it was a bit of a  stressful negotiation  I'm sure  but the gangs  it's weird though  they won't  they won't rob you  if the gangs  are letting you in  I don't think  right  I'm assuming  they won't  I think anything goes  sounds like a crazy place  not if they know  you made a deal  with the gangs  the guys who run  the favelas  they're all run  by drug lords  then your life  would be a living hell  after you guys  cleared out  yeah  the other thing  that was weird  is  there's tons  of motorcycle traffic  and it's against 
[02:12:00]  the law  for two people  to be on a motorcycle  oh really  because the traffic's  so bad  what happens  is one guy  is driving the bike  the guy on the back  just has a gun  and taps on fucking windows  and robs cars  one after the other  and drives off  no  what a great gimmick  so to combat that problem  they just said  no you can't take  your friend anywhere  wow  god what a bunch  of criminals  genius though right  it's crazy  it's a fantastic city  though the food 
[02:12:30]  was amazing  you didn't see  any of that shit  it wasn't poison  did you have to have  someone taste it  no  jeez  no we recorded  every day  from like 10 in the morning  till 11 o'clock  or midnight  how long were you down there  for over a week  but you didn't see  any of the shit  you're describing  no the last day  we went  we went out  and went downtown  and you know  got to see  legitimate prostitutes  and that kind of fun stuff  was it scary or no  uh  how far was your hotel  from when you had to record  like  well  by traffic 
[02:13:00]  sometimes it was like  an hour and a half  but if there wasn't  not getting a hotel closer  20 minutes  um  yeah that was a bit  of a nerve-wracking thing too  is trying to figure out  like  how nice of a hotel  like  will I not get fucking  cracked over on the head  in this one  or  were you constantly  looking around  like oh god  am I gonna get fucking  pounced  well and see  I grew up in a paranoid  household anyway  because my dad was a  drug narc  uh  and had a  contract out on his life  when I was a kid  so  we had  we had guns 
[02:13:30]  all over the house  like constantly waiting  before home invasions  were cool  we had  uh  like  we would stack  soda cans and stuff  in front of the doors  in case somebody  oh really  so you'd hear that  yeah  so you'd hear that  and  I remember the one time  I almost got shot  in the face  by my father  was as a kid  I thought it would be  hysterical  if I  when he  when he  when he  when he came home  I mean you know  when he was out like  buying heroin and shit  from people  um  when he came home  I thought I'd hide  behind the door 
[02:14:00]  and scare him  oh good  yeah  really good idea  wow  yeah  gun out  nearly  nearly took me out  he was a drug narc  yeah  he gnarred to the government  no no  he would  he was  he worked for the cops  he would  oh  there was a bunch of heroin  moving  this is the 70s  there's a bunch of heroin  moving from  up from Mexico  we got some horse  coming in  yeah  some horse coming  through uh  Oklahoma  that was a cop  yeah  oh okay  I thought he turned  state's evidence  no no no  that would have sucked 
[02:14:30]  that's not what he meant  he drugged  I thought he narced  he ratted  who put a hit on him  somebody busted  no obviously  yeah  mafia  now just some big  just some big  drug heroin  they must hate  when they lose  a lot of heroin  that's coming in  yeah but you can't put a hit  on the cops though  because it just makes  what do you think  the cops are going to do  if you murder a cop  what if he's a bad cop  what if he's a dirty cop  you're right  they just might  we do have people  on the payroll  but they uh  that just makes  it makes  they'd like a story  like that  they'd like a story 
[02:15:00]  like that  they might  they just might  but uh  it fucking makes life  miserable for everybody  if they kill a cop  it's just stupid  to do  well it doesn't  stop them from doing it  especially  like I said  when they lose  that huge shipment  of heroin  you can't just go  yeah the cops took it  oh okay  what happens to the guy  that is supposed  to bring it up  like when he has  to go back  and go yeah  the cops got it  well there's a story  in Max Mermelstein's book  called The Man Who Made It Snow 
[02:15:30]  about Max Mermelstein  who was one of the first Americans  if not he got deep deep  inside the uh  Medellin cartel  because he married  a Colombian girl  and helped her brother  hide a body  like he didn't know  what was happening  like he didn't  but the guy  introduced him  as my compadre  and once they do that  that means I'm vouching  for this American  with my life  so he gets into  the Colombian cartel  he actually  goes over to Colombia  and he gets to meet  like Pablo Escobar  and I think Luis Gacha  who was alive at the time 
[02:16:00]  get a picture with him  there is a picture of  I don't know if  Blow was based on him  or around his life  oh right  okay  it might have been  but  see Jimmy down there  Pablo  taps him on the arm  can you get a picture  I gotta get a picture  with Pablo  then I'm twittering  and I'm like  I'm fucking Pablo  but uh  he  there was one  the Ocha brothers  I think were the guys  who ran it with Escobar  and they would drop  fucking heroin  in bundles  or coke in bundles  out of prop planes  and it would hit the water 
[02:16:30]  and you'd collect it  it was a genius way  of doing it  but a couple of the bags  broke open  and they lost  a lot of coke  oh shit  a lot of coke  and uh  they had  he had to go  uh  or him and the pilot  had to go to Colombia  and explain  and they didn't know  if they were gonna  make it out alive  no shit  wouldn't you just  take off at that point  no you can't  they'd kill your family  and the thing was  it's the cost of doing business  oh really  the cost of doing business  is you will lose 
[02:17:00]  some product sometimes  you think he fucked with them  a little bit though  when they were there  like thinking they're gonna die  and you're like  and they didn't seem like  very fun men  go into that room over there  and there's a party for them  streamers  this might have been  the first time they did it  just kidding  this might have been  the first time they did it  or one of the first times  it was a brand new way  of delivering coke  and then all of a sudden  they lose  wow  that's how they used to  have a fucking uh  the way they  I think I've said this before  they would have  they would load the coke  into a car  like they would take  a car apart  and all the sides of it 
[02:17:30]  had coke in it  and the tire  it was a coke car  and they would tow it  and put it on the back  of a tow truck  cause that was a lot less  likely to attract attention  than a guy driving  so they'd have a tow truck  driver pulling the coke car  and they would send  another guy out  right behind it  with a bottle of liquor  and if by chance  the tow truck got pulled over  this fucking guy  was gonna drink  and fucking run  into the cop car  that was parked  because that would take  the attention  off the coke  and then the car 
[02:18:00]  would just drive back  into traffic  that was their plan  if you know  not to kill the cop  but just to fucking  rear end his car  while it was parked  and a guy drunk  rear end a cop car  they're gonna focus on him  what a fall guy  that guy's gotta be  yeah but the  you know the thing  is life in prison  for everybody  yeah  if you don't do that  wow  yeah  the man who made it snow  good book  there's probably  better ones now  damn  sounds like a good read  yeah it was great  we should break  Laszlo in studio  we'll talk about  some other shit  Laszlo always has  good stories  you wanted to promote

[02:25:30]  ever  it was just terrible  well  I'd rather talk to less people on satellite  than fucking more people  and feel like a disgusting  unfunny prostitute  oh god I'll sell out  give me a fucking gig  can you do top 40  Nick Hannon's not on  I'll do fucking top 40  you go back to 92-3  that's what radio is  I'll do a Paris Hilton break  if I have to  let's do this  alright  make some phone calls  I'll start putting feelers out there  yes  we gotta do better stuff with this  oh really  talk to the guys down the hall  fuck the guys down the hall  we've tried everything  they won't let us do shit 
[02:26:00]  fuck those guys  gotta go rogue  yeah fuck those guys  look at Anthony  he doesn't even show up for this break  I hope right now his face is  I hope he's vomiting  and he's noticing flecks of other people's shit  on the seat next to his face  I do like that  they don't even notice what we do  on a regular basis  they didn't even notice  E-Rock wasn't introducing  the worst of the week shit  for like  no  and then they get in trouble for it  there's only eight months  and then they get in trouble  because they look like assholes  then they come down hard  on Sam and E-Rock  have I talked about this  on the air yet  they beat the shit 
[02:26:30]  out of these two  when they were the dummies  that didn't notice  for eight months  so now they do it  they should beat the shit  out of each other  resentment in their voice  like when you listen  on the weekends  they don't want to do that  they can tell  they just flipped a switch  like here's some fucking shit  number eight  I don't even do it anymore  and E-Rock just comes on  and does it passive aggressively  I was listening the other weekend  E-Rock just grabbing assholes  out of the hall  to introduce stuff  yeah I walked out  halfway through this weekend  and just let other jocks  around here host it  quality control  Sam and E-Rock  kind of came to me  and said look  we don't really need  to intro these bits 
[02:27:00]  we're like fine  but their mistake  they never told management  but management didn't know  for eight fucking months  so then when they find out  instead of going  oh wow we're idiots  they beat the shit  out of Sam and E-Rock  and threatened firings  and all sorts of shit  and then forced them  to do it  what's up Lazlo  I heard you had  sorry I saw Rick Santorum  does he drive you nuts  he is a cunt  does he drive you  fucking nuts  his whole pro-home school  anti-public school  like America  if we ever hope to be  a superpower again 
[02:27:30]  having moms at home  teach thermonuclear dynamics  and high brow science stuff  is clearly how we're going to  invent the next iPhone  can I ask you  can I ask you  it's Santorum  or Obama  what do you do  I vote Santorum  I don't give a shit  I'm not  I'm not voting for Obama  sorry  that's just hard headed  well you call him  what you want  Romney  Romney Obama  I understand you 
[02:28:00]  going Romney  but Santorum  I don't care  this guy  he's a religious crazy  I don't care  if it's fucking  put it this way  if that woman  that runs that  fucking church  what's her name  Margie Phelps  or the Phelps's  if Margie Phelps  is against Obama  I'm voting for her  that's what's going on  it's not just racism  he's been reeling  since his one black friend died  exactly  that's so racism  it's a tribute  that's just racism  it's in tribute to Patrice 
[02:28:30]  at this point  you just gotta call it  what it is  that's just racist  you just started  the African Americans  for Obama  did we talk about that  before we said  no we didn't  African Americans  for Obama  yeah that website's up  great  and it's like  I don't mind him  doing that  because I understand  like you want to  get your voter base  go fine  but we all know  what would happen  if somebody else  did that  Caucasians  for Santorum  we all know  how that would go  and it's fucking  ridiculous  that the same people  that would crucify  you doing that  are too afraid 
[02:29:00]  to say anything  about him starting  a race  based movement  for himself  it's a race  based movement  for himself  African Americans  for Obama  why in a country  where we're all voting  should African Americans  their votes don't count  any more than any other vote  stupid  why not just Americans  for Obama  African Americans  for Obama  I'm alright with it  because we're the superior race  so it don't matter  Jesus Christ  what show have I come on 
[02:29:30]  what's happened  in the last year  that right there  is fucking honest though  because that's  that's the way  they look at it  by allowing it  it doesn't bother me  that's how they look at it  we're trying to get fired  but no one's listening  to the show anymore  we're just trying  yesterday was Asian shit  today it's  yeah  Whitey is the superior race  there you go  let's get that on  Huffington Post  will ya  that's  huh  Ron and Fez  got the beautiful  Fez story on  Huffington Post  oh now you think  it's a beautiful story  I said it yesterday  you called Fez a she  I mumbled  have fun with that 
[02:30:00]  at least he said  their show was good today  yeah let's hear this  no we don't need  to hear that again  I want to know  about Laszlo Zymus  appearance  because he was coming  during the break  it was a disaster  it was a doozy  really  it was a disaster  why were you invited  on there first of all  well so  I'm not questioning  because you're a good guest  my chick's father  has been a fan of Imus  for a million years  and so  you Opie  actually hooked me up  with somebody on the show  that you're friends with  Rob  how's his son working out  good  good  and  why'd you look down 
[02:30:30]  when you said that  no no he's good  it just  you know  I don't want it to sound  like Opie called  and said  can you hire my friend  and I sort of did  well we help each other out  I said only hire him  if he's good  no he was great  and it turns out  I hear that he's doing  a good job  yeah so I said to him  can you get me  just  you know  an introduction to Imus  my chick's dad  would love it  it would be  and it would make me  because I'm constantly worried  that  that  they think I'm a cretin  just a tattoo  covered 
[02:31:00]  drug addled  alcoholic cretin  oh  but you work for Rockstar  that's cool  so correct  and so  I  so I said to him  look I think I can get you  to meet Imus  he's one of your heroes  this whole thing  so we wake up  at like 3 in the morning  or something  he comes down  and stays with me  we go into the city  and we're backstage  in the green room  and  Imus  comes out  and just leans  against a wall  looking like  walking from makeup  to  the front  area there 
[02:31:30]  was just exhausting  probably was  and so  there was some introductions  and it's like  you know  this is  Laszlo  he's a friend of Opie and Anthony  and he's like  oh Opie and Anthony  I like those guys  and so  and then he just stops talking  and just stares at me  and so I just start talking  and I'm like  yeah you know  they're really good guys  and I've known them  for a lot of years  I'm on their show  occasionally  and I start to realize  I'm kind of babbling  and  and  and  and  and  and  and  that was so bad dude 
[02:32:00]  it was so bad  and I said  you know  I used to do a show  over you know  on their channel  and that was a lot of fun  but it fell apart  because fuck satellite radio  whatever  and he  and I  he goes yeah  stop talking  and I was like  precisely  that's  you know  I should stop talking  I should stop  he said  he goes stop talking  and I was like  right  I should stop talking  to you know  them and try to negotiate  a deal  he goes no  stop talking  and I was like  oh he's telling me  to shut up  and I was like  I was just kind of 
[02:32:30]  telling you how I knew  Opie and Anthony  he was like  I don't need to hear  your whole damn radio  resume  and I was like  and so  I go  and so  can I stop you  for one second please  I've known I'm as forever  and that's exactly  what I've done  he's a  he's really tough  to talk to  tough dude  I'm only backing you up  because I've known him  and I've had that exact  same experience  remember when we were  in the green room  for his big thing  we did at the Hard Rock  and he came in  and we're like  you invited us  and now we feel like 
[02:33:00]  complete fucking  outsiders here  yeah  but anyway  so now I look like  an asshole  in front of my chick's  father  because I'm just  getting trashed  by  was he being funny  though when he said it  no  he was not being funny  he was  I was babbling  and he was telling me  to shut the fuck up  it was  it was humiliating  stop talking  stop talking  I love it  and so  then I sort of  did the quick  introduction  to 
[02:33:30]  my chick's dad  and that was  that was  but you know  was he nice to him  yeah  and I was just  I was sweating  but he was also talking  about how he was having  difficulty breathing  so I kind of like  you know  what was that about  did he have oxygen  he's dying  and he didn't want to hear  about how the technophile  didn't get picked up  in Des Moines  how could I  just not want to hear  about I know you  and I don't want to  hear that story  good for others  he's a very honest guy  we're supposed to watch  the show now 
[02:34:00]  and I'm like  completely dazed  you're flustered  yeah  wait  was this all done  in front of your father-in-law  yes  oh no  dude  I was cringing  and I realized  I'd done it too  I'd just gone  because when somebody's quiet  you just  babble  it's a fucking radio thing  you just fucking  gotta fill up the dead air  you take Laszlo here  to meet me  fuck off  so we went  the show's about to start  we sit off on the side  and I'm like 
[02:34:30]  well you know  cool  we'll be able to watch  you know  a live  a live show  he's not 30 seconds  into the fucking music  and he starts complaining  about this guy  you met backstage  and then the cameras  come over to me  and it's me looking  like a complete dumbass  like yeah hi  and he railed on me  on national television  for a while  oh man  was it funny though  did he say  he just kept talking  he was funny  he was just a rock star  fucking rock star game guy  I was like oh my god  but isn't that  but that's what a great radio guy 
[02:35:00]  it's like  he just had this  like a mildly annoying encounter  and made 15 minutes out of it  he wouldn't shut up  did he say that  you talked a lot  yeah  did he say you were friends  with Opie and Anthony  and ridicule you  oh my god  that's funny  he mostly ridiculed me  I was  I was  yeah  so  and I think  wow  that's funny  I think Rob  kind of tried to  intervene  and be like  no no 
[02:35:30]  my son's  trying out for a job  over with him  if you could  be cool  hey Rob's an enabler  over there  yeah  he's trying to keep  everything nice  it was amazing though  to watch that  show happen  from  from behind the scenes  yeah  it's just  why  just because man  the production  is just boom boom boom  you know  when you're doing  live television  like that  just to watch  you're saying  we don't have  a production value  here  I'm just saying  you get  well you're dressed  like you just  went to a garage sale  and you haven't  shaved in 
[02:36:00]  six months  Patrice died  right  well  we wanted more  I don't have to tell you  it wasn't  it wasn't  for lack of trying  yeah  we wanted more  we don't need  all that happy horse shit  we had cameras  in the studio  we were well  on our way  but if you did  a live morning  TV show  just like Jim  was saying  I would be  I would be  shaved  showered  I'd have  fucking nice  iron shirts on  we still  can do that  we still  can do that  we still  can do that  I have a good idea 
[02:36:30]  no  I have a good  TV show idea  for this program  oh  and if he really  means it  he won't say it  no I won't say it  I actually really do  I thought you were  going to say something  ridiculous  oh yeah  I've had it  for a long time  AIDS  no no no  that I think I have  but I don't want to get tested  because then I can get sued  how many times have you been tested  for what  AIDS  shit  the last time I got tested  I remember looking out the window  and seeing the trade center  no I've been tested 
[02:37:00]  a bunch of times  I don't do anything  that would get like  I mean I really don't do anything  AIDS  like I would never get  fucked in the ass  I'll let a dick rub on my ass  but I'm not getting fucked by it  what am I  what am I crazy  no I'm okay  let's do something  AIDS  tonight  I feel a little kinky  but my TV idea  for this program  would require  a different studio  but it's  and it's different  than what Stern does  it's not that  it's got a similar element  but it's not that show  it's not that show 
[02:37:30]  I like the idea  so you're gonna bring us up  a flagpole  or whatever the fuck  they do around here  throw it upstairs  before they burn something  they throw it upstairs  and then reject it  horribly  I saw somebody  first thing this morning  and he put me  in a fucking bad mood  I haven't been able  to tell yet  my favorite part  it was at 5 fucking 30  I'm like  we're getting ready  for a radio show  are you still in the bad mood  yeah kinda  I'm working through it  my favorite part  of this morning was  I looked up  because I thought  it was Travis  Travis comes in  at the same time  every morning 
[02:38:00]  and it's a little like  hey guys  blah blah blah  blah blah  we socialize a little bit  and he lays down  what's happening  and I looked up  because I thought  it was him  and it was fucking  that bald fuck  oh Jesus  does that guy out there  look like an unfinished clone  as I was talking about  yes  yeah  he comes in  and he starts  jibber jabbering  about something  that we got coming up  and then  what do you mean  something Cleveland  I will  but I don't want to  get into that yet  I want to just get into 
[02:38:30]  what happened  so he starts discussing  some fucking time date thing  whatever it is  and he needs my input  on something  but I'm watching  the television  because I was watching  something about Kid Rock  playing a song for Centorum  even though he endorsed  Obama in 2008  so I'm kind of interested  in that  because I might want to  talk about it on the air  and I turn  and he's looking at me  like waiting for an answer  to the question  I didn't fucking even hear  because I'm fucking  doing what I do  every morning  watching television  reading shit 
[02:39:00]  you know  I never looked up  because I was  I was reading newspapers  and I'm like  who is that  last minute prep  who's the one  where where where  I don't see it  she's walking in  she's on smash  what's smash  oh that's that  blonde from smash  it's the Catherine McPhee  and that blonde  yeah  she's a fucking  looker man  she's a dick  she's a looker man  she's a dick  she's a Broadway starlet  boo  ah man she's too  famous for us  yeah  well yeah  so he was looking  at me and I was  just like  I go what's the  question 
[02:39:30]  I go I was  watching television  you're hostile  you know what I do  it was a little hostile  then he told us  we can't do the  glass coffee table day  what  we're trying to do  glass coffee table day  we have a coffee table  brought in  we have a complete  hazmat team  prep the studio  we got everything  figured out  everything good  we have a glass table  we're not actually  handling the shit  and girls shit on the table  we just want to see  what it looks like  it's totally fantastic  not because we're  turned on by it  as a goof  speak for yourself  yeah exactly  we've heard the stories  over the years  so we want to try it out 
[02:40:00]  and go alright  what is the big deal about it  so are you actually going to  lay under the coffee table  yes  the shit's not going to hit you  that'd be great  just watching a girl's ass  open up and shit fall down  hysterical  we'll be mic'd  it'll be hilarious radio  guaranteed  it'll be great  and there'll be people  in hazmat suits  hazmat suits  and then they could  make sure everything's  collected up  nothing's dangerous  everything's prepared  before, during, and after  and then we have  a great segment  well apparently  they ran it past  the lawyers  and that ain't gonna wash  well that joke  came in this morning 
[02:40:30]  to go  in case you're interested  he said  he goes  in case you really  wanted me to look  into it  I did  and I'm looking  I'm like  of course we want  you to look into it  everything's on the table  with us  well not everything  apparently  and then he goes  and I talked to the lawyers  and they actually  cited a case  and he mentioned  a state or something  how it's  what the state of Maryland  versus table shitter  they cited  it was this  Sylvester Stallone  versus  was it a radio case 
[02:41:00]  though  or a film case  they cited a case  where it's absolutely  an obscenity problem  well the problem  here's what Satellite says  because they're in  every single city  and they will go after you  for  what do they call it  obscenity  obscenity charges  the local towns  oh yeah  it's arbitrary  local  community standards  community standards  it's their own morality  in some other place  is different  than it will be  in New York  Max Hardcore went to jail  for that 
[02:41:30]  for four years  and it was some  what he did  was a violation  of community standards  in Tampa  but he mailed something  yeah they got him  through mailing shit  though  yeah but I mean  it was still  community standards  we're not mailing anything  well except for this program  mailing this show  every day  but that's what  they're so fucking  paranoid about  but jeez  what a great  fucking bit that would be  it's an amazing bit  but he was surprised  like just in case  of course we want you  to fucking argue it  and see if we get it done  live from the compound  we're supposed to be 
[02:42:00]  oh I would so do that  I will make a trip  out to Long Island  you just gotta watch  scat though  like watch showing  the shit  there's a weird thing  with scat  that is a problem  legally  we won't have to show  believe me  we can set the camera  up in a way  where you would just  see our faces  and the girls face  you know  shit like that  we'll do it outside  when the weather  gets nice  so it's not  no one's shitting  in my house  why  we do it out  by the pool  oh just sell it out  already  what are you on  fucking K-Rock  honey you fucking  man up  do it on  put your  we'll all lay on 
[02:42:30]  your painting  and do it  no  let's do it next week  and saran wrap  but even if somebody  came after you for that  I mean that's a  that's a fight  oh you would want to  get in that  that you would want to fight  right  who  I would want to be  the shit poster boy  nobody would come  to your defense  nobody would stick up  for you  but there's enough  I'll finally have to  just say  don't stick up  for Anthony  I'll be Anthony  but just watching  news networks  try to describe  what it was  what it was 
[02:43:00]  that would be  would be hysterical  very funny  more importantly  we're going to broadcast  live from Cleveland  for Jimmy's big  you know  Cleveland steamer  that works  that would be perfect  I want to play  a little game right now  really quick  how do they  fuck this one up  we're supposed to  broadcast live  from Cleveland  right  let's bet  let's bet on this  how is this fucked up  okay  I have an idea  for Cleveland  oh  who said  Cleveland steamer  Laszlo  I did  we do  the Cleveland steamer 
[02:43:30]  now  we provide  bags  that are not  see through  but that are  hazardous waste  right  comfortable  or accessible  yeah  we have a contest  as to what girl  can throw her  she walks into the bathroom  the bag  is empty  uh-huh  she comes out of the bathroom  right  the bag is full  uh-huh 
[02:44:00]  hopefully  and then we see  hopefully right  hopefully  hopefully  we need to find some shitters  and then we see  whoever has  the heaviest bag  the heaviest bag  wins  tickets to my show  and money  I like it  it's a nice trade  a pile of shit  I like it  the Cleveland steamer  I like it  working it out  on the air  that's a good  I tell you  we get  we get hazardous waste bags  we don't see what they're doing  right  um 
[02:44:30]  right  okay  you got it  do it up  down the hall  goes uh  Sam  he's gonna  he's gotta go talk to useless  this is uh  oh useless  and don't just  don't just approach the lawyers  with that face  oh here's what they want to do now  but we're not even gonna be  broadcasting live from Cleveland  you understand that  no no  they're gonna fuck something up  oh  right  so how do they fuck it up  wait we're not broadcasting  no uh  we want to  in the afternoon right  we wanna do it  if we can  yeah yeah yeah  that'd be fun  yeah we wanna do afternoon  but they will fuck it up  oh I know 
[02:45:00]  the cost will be too high  no alcohol involved  something will happen  yeah  why didn't they  fuck  why'd they fuck with the alcohol  you can't fuck with the alcohol  no  what was it  our last uh  live show  we weren't allowed to have alcohol  at the high rock  and whose idea was that  see what they're doing us Laszlo  that has nothing to do with any type of rules  no no  and god forbid that the hard rock makes a little bit of cash on the thing  and that's what it's all about  that's how they make some money  so you got people coming in here and drinking  it's of their venue  you got our fans just jonesing for fucking a beer 
[02:45:30]  and they can't have this  there's nothing worse than a sober Opie and Anthony fan  that sucks  that sucks  they want  they're afraid of liability  and to a point where  I just hope that there are big changes made  with not with the people you'd expect  with certain people who are not known to our listeners  I'll go on record  I want everyone fucking swept out  you want a clean sweep  no for me  I want a tsunami wave to hit the 36th floor  and take them all out  let's start over  let's do a reset  for me the true culprit 
[02:46:00]  the one I dislike the most  is not a name that's ever been mentioned on the show  and I really mean that  oh yeah wow  the one I dislike the most  no  the one guy we've mentioned a lot  could have fucking taken care of a lot of situations  but there's a guy more powerful than him  Eric Nagel  who drives me  it is  it is Eric  we've never said that name on the radio  we've only said like fatso  and hey Judy Blume subject  wow  but I don't mean that stuff Eric  hey  no  hey foot  you know  farting machine  and broken chair 
[02:46:30]  no I still blame Scott Greenstein  simple as that  simple as that  he could have got  a lot of things done for us  chose not to  did you talk to Useless  I talked to  my boss  who did you talk to  because I'm here with you  with these guys  I didn't hear it  I talked to Gary  so what was  Useless  what did Useless say  Gary told me that  he will see it  about it  he will see  about it  I will help pitch that  I'll pitch that bit  Jimmy's the guy 
[02:47:00]  that could pitch it  can I go pitch it  and come right back  because I would love  for you to pitch it right  I'm going to make  because what  go ahead  sorry  no no no  because I think that Sam  because Sam walks in  they're all sheepish  and I know  and like when he makes  a wrestling face  this is the  I have a bit face  so I'm going to go in there  and do it right  yeah  go ahead  all right  Jimmy is going to go  that's called  going to work boys  nice  by the way  two days  two bits  I'm keeping track  every day we're coming up  with a bit  every day  and we watch him 
[02:47:30]  get rejected  and his job is to  fucking then  if we can't do the bit  we're giving you  you have to bring  something to the show  so he owes you a bit  for yesterday  at least one already  yeah  and if this doesn't pass  he owes you a second one  well I don't know  what he does  what does he do  he manages the channel  he yells at you guys  for not doing it  manages to what  and what else does he do  what does he do  seriously  well he communicates  day to day operations  for the Opie and Anthony  channel what  he's certainly  a legal liaison  alright but that's  that's called a secretary  yeah that's a useless job 
[02:48:00]  because there's no every time  so you could be doing that job  um  continue  he  so you don't even know  well he sits at the top of the table  at our meetings  eric get in on this  it's for the radio show  what does he do  day to day shit  for the Opie and Anthony channel  what does he do  I don't see him really  so I don't know  no one wants to  no one wants to say anything  like he  he makes sure all  Opie and Anthony  show related business  is taken care of  are you gonna be in trouble 
[02:48:30]  for even mentioning  this stuff now probably  no they don't yell at me  that much anymore  because they know  that I just  I just tell you guys  everything that they say  so they don't  and you should  yeah  what does he do  really  he goes to lawyers  and the lawyers  just say no  so that's not really  a skill  he oversees all  that oversee corporate shit  show related  right Laszlo  what does that mean  oversee  it's all  too many layers  it's all this vague shit  what does oversee mean  like I  I honestly know  that if he wasn't  in our lives 
[02:49:00]  the show would be  exactly the same  no I'm being  oh that's why  it's funny  I'm not being shocking  that's why  I'm telling you  I'm telling you  that's exactly  how I feel  when I leave this place  that nothing  would be different  nothing  see  if Rob and Gary  and you know  Bladder weren't around  the show would be  exactly the same  all three  yeah Bladder gets  sort of a pass  because he got  such a huge promotion  that he's not  really involved  so I'm not even  trashing him 
[02:49:30]  I'm not even  trashing him  the company's already  you know  moved him on  from our channel  technically  let's be honest  today for instance  we would have  walked in  sat down  done the show  we've been doing  and then leave  well you would have  been able to do  the Kid Rock break  oh right  he actually  affected the show  he actually  affected the show  today  and couldn't talk  about Kid Rock  and he  and I'm embarrassed  to say this  he put me in  an instant bad mood  that I've been  working out  for the last  two hours  how long  it's been two hours 
[02:50:00]  it's been more  than two hours  I started waking up  around 830  seriously  he put me  in a bad mood  so now  but that's  a normal show  that's like  what would happen  on a daily basis  I'm not in a bad mood  anymore  no I don't mean that  no I don't mean that  no I'm not  you haven't been  around in a while  I'm not  it's when I see  these guys  yes  yes  the show itself  but I avoid them  so I don't go  on the bad mood  the show itself  I'm talking about  normal show  this is what we do  on a daily basis  right  how do they  make that possible  is it anything 
[02:50:30]  they do  that make it  so we come in  sit down  do our show  and leave  because that's  what we do  it's time to  call this idiot out  what does he do  to make the show  better  when we had  our last live broadcast  we weren't allowed  to have alcohol  that makes the show  worse  so what is he doing  to make the show  better  I would even go  a step further  I think the show  would actually be  better off without him  you think you could  go that far  fuck yeah  we never needed  a boss before  Eric Logue  was the times  that you've been  thrown out of cities 
[02:51:00]  yeah well maybe  on that we needed  a stronger boss  that would have  we always ended up  okay  it's true  honestly if we didn't  do the mayor's prank  in Boston  we'd be just  shitbags in Boston  still  shitbags  making no money  that catapulted  us to the top  of the business  yeah exactly  we'd be that  stupid hill man  guy  who's he  he's a nobody  who the fuck  are you  the only one  we ever listened  to was Logan  and he took off  he's the only one  that I fucking  totally respected  abandoned  he's in the warm 
[02:51:30]  embrace of Oprah's  breasts  I know  someone sent a link  to a story  oh yeah  yesterday  did you see that  one  Eric Logan  arrested for  child molestation  in Pennsylvania  I clicked on it  going there is  absolutely a possibility  it could be  the Eric Logan  I was just waiting  to see his picture  I was thinking  in my head  before I clicked  on Mike  let me think  20% possibility  it could be him  I was thinking too  like this might be him  and then when the picture  was a thumbnail  like that  I was like  well  well  might have gained  a little weight  Jimmy  Jimmy's back 
[02:52:00]  after pitching  the latest idea  according to Gary  Sam has not been  pitching the ideas  he has just been  coming back  and just going  they're just doing  a bit idea  and walking back out  he's like going to  see the manager  at a car dealership  I'm going to go  talk to the manager  real quick  well he's never  done this before  I just made that up  by the way  Gary didn't say that  I wanted to watch  stupid sweat  he's going to take  $100 off of that  true coat  you're a liar  Gary said that 
[02:52:30]  he doesn't  foresee  a problem  with this one  he will  he goes  I can't guarantee  you anything  but he goes  I don't see  can I explain  that nobody  will see  what they're doing  we know  what they're doing  and he will  go to Scott  with it  can I translate this  sure  he knows we're  on the air  so that's exactly  what he was going  to say  and then  he'll tell us  the shit  off hours  like he did  this morning  tomorrow morning  I'll walk in  about that  hoping that  we'll move on  and not talk

[03:20:30]  legs  yeah  imagine the 50s  seeing this  here  no  they didn't have  computers  I'm sure there's a lot  of things to be more  shocked at  stealing how to clone  the one house  this looks great  yeah  tip for all the guns  oh yeah  I don't go for that  the whole gun  can't you guys make a 
[03:21:00]  nice game without guns  nice  holy fuck  drugs  good explosions  looks great  yeah and it's got all  that bullet time  and shit  bullet time  I love the bullet time  in Max Payne  just when you think  you're not going to be  able to do that shit  you can jump out  from fucking behind a  wall  bullet time  bam  take out like  fucking three guys  which bullet time  slows everything down  so you can aim better  their reaction time  slower  and you could  you could target  your guys a lot easier  and it just looks  cool as fuck  how many times  can you bullet time 
[03:21:30]  you have to build it  build up  very cool  good for you  there's a pre-ordered  special now  there's like a special  edition  it comes with like  a statue of Max Payne  and some extra  characters for the  multiplayer  I like that  I'm gonna get that one  and anything else  going on  you don't do radio  anymore at all  just here  no  people post stuff  like you fucking  don't like  you hate your fans  no I don't fucking  hate my fans  just we're working  nights and weekends  making two games 
[03:22:00]  I know you  gave me an email  you shot me an email  about doing a show  down at my house  and then  I was on vacation  some kind of floating  you should be doing radio  zip lining  you should be doing radio  Lazo  you're good at it  I don't have to tell you  but it's too bad  you're not doing it  did radio get the best of you  have you had it  I got very bitter  I have to say  and this place  helped  it really did  like last time  I was on your show  I was just a bitter mess  it's final  it's fucking  the last straw radio  this place  what was the problem 
[03:22:30]  I like getting these stories out there  it's like watching your friends  in a POW camp  and you come to visit  it's just  what happened to you though  no just because  I mean in the end  we're still doing well  we just want to be doing better  and we know we can  because we dug doing  a show on your channel  and they just put  the fucking kibosh on it  why  because you wanted  a little money maybe  well because what  we were getting from XM  they came in  and cut it 75%  and these guys  weren't even making  that much money  to do their shows  75% pay cut 
[03:23:00]  was something  I just really couldn't  on a number  that wasn't impressive  75% pay cut  that's like  just asked  to just  we were literally  doing one Saturday  a month  yeah  that paid for  train fare  and some beers  and what is that  going to do  like for their  bottom line  like to fuck you  over like that  is that going to be  like well we had to  because we needed  to buy a fleet  of vehicles  for the  no it's  not even  it doesn't even  pay for a mic 
[03:23:30]  for a fucking  microphone  come on  we're supposed  to do a couple  in uh  we're down  we're down to that  wow  I don't know  if we're a lot  of talk numbers  so I wrote that  for you  that's an ugly  that's where  our bitterness  comes from  that's an ugly  no wonder  you're growing  a beard  and  oh  it's fucking  yeah  this place  so what do they do  with the 25%  that you turned down  huh  what  what do they do  with the 25%  I don't know  yeah  it didn't go to  the Sam Roberts  organization  that's not even  what I was talking about  that's so weird  but  I think we're gonna 
[03:24:00]  try to stop by  Anthony's and do a show  next two or three weeks  always welcome  should be podcasting  yeah  yeah  do the  do the old  campaign show  alright Jimmy  what do you got brother  I have Rochester  tomorrow  Friday Saturday  the comedy club  no no no  tomorrow's Wednesday  oh I'm sorry  Thursday Friday Saturday  Jimmy you're scared me  I know  everybody thinks  I'm doing Wednesday  what is this  what's this  a comedy  commercial  and March 15th

[03:33:00]  Rockstar like  I don't play  video games I  don't know  anything about  any video games  I don't I  play WWE  games video  game what  you say  that's a  video game  yeah I  play WWE  12 like  there's no  tomorrow I'm  not very good  I can't play  online  because everybody  would beat me  but I'm okay  exhibition mode  do you create  your own character  no it takes  way too long  gotcha  I just go out  there's Brodus Clay  and dominate  do they have  Funkasaurus on that  or is it old  Brodus Clay  it's the old one  it's a downloadable  but I just 
[03:33:30]  dominate  just  everywhere I go  you're just  dominating the  computer  yeah and I  why don't you  go online and  play against real  people  because I'd  lose every time  it's not fun  you don't know  until you try  no I tried it  like a few years  ago with the  other I'm not  good at video  games  I'm slow  with machines  hence the  multiple google  complaints  maybe you're a  pc gamer like  anthony is  no I'm not a  pc gamer  I don't like  I use the computer  to like edit 
[03:34:00]  video and go  on some  websites  I'm not  I'm not a  big  pornography and  professional wrestling  websites  that's it  that's it  and notsam.com  that's it  that's the only  websites I go to  but what I was  saying is  all I do is play  wrestling games  and rock  rockstar is the  only non-wrestling  game company that  I'll even give a  shot to  like and  even rockstar  games I just  get overwhelmed  like red dead  so much to it  exactly 
[03:34:30]  they're a whole  world red dead  redemption  love it  I love the  premise of the  game I love  what I could  play but I  could never get  past Bonnie  McFarlane's ranch  that she takes  you to  that's the very  first part of the  game  yeah all I knew  how to do was  climb up the  water tower and  start shooting the  sheriff when he  came to get you  I didn't know  what to do they  were like ride the  horse the sheriff  comes to get you  because you're  shooting people  well what else is  there to do he's  supposed to learn  how to ride  right there 
[03:35:00]  how to rope  cattle  nope no thank  you get different  kinds of guns  and then you have  to ride the horse  very far and  things like that  I'm not doing  that I can't I  can't folk I  don't have that  kind of attention  for video games I  just can't do it  so but I mean I  played it a bunch  that first part  you know I just  but I would go  around I'd ride the  horse till I  found somewhere  to tie it up  I'd get off the  horse and I'd  shoot the horse  like that's that  was the whole game  to me it's just  or I'd go and  there'd be like 
[03:35:30]  three horses tied  up to one of  those you know  wooden things and  I just get off the  horse and I just  shoot the three  horses and then  run away and wait  wait for people to  chase me climb up  onto something tall  and just start you  know taking people  out uh Michael  Douglas style you  know in the  general store in  the first level is  Anthony that's his  character really yeah  now have I gotten to  the first level or  am I still at the  ranch you should be  able to at some  point go into that  little general store  where you can buy  um equipment and  maps and things like  that yeah and  Anthony's the guy in 
[03:36:00]  there and if you  learn how to use the  lasso and all that  you can hog tie  Anthony's character and  drag him around the  town see I figure I'd  just shoot him well  eventually you'll have  to because everyone's  gonna start chasing you  and trying to kill you  because you hog tied the  guy oh I see are you  supposed to hog tie him  that's the game no but  there's fun to it oh I  gotcha but like there's  actually clips on  YouTube yeah when the  game came out and they  found out that was  Ant's character that they  would take Ant's  character and tie him to  the train tracks just for  fun I'll play all the 
[03:36:30]  uh GTA games like I  played those games for  hours eventually some of  the missions get far too  difficult for me but  before that I have a lot  of fun and then like I'll  play for like a few  weeks and I'll have a  great time then I'll  have to put in the get  all weapons code that's  cheating well I gotta get  the weapon somehow  otherwise how am I gonna  do anything I know  that that's what I'm  saying you unlock certain  achievements and then  you upgrade your  weaponry how come they  xed out the phones in  the other room I don't 
[03:37:00]  know what's wrong with  them on x the phone  yeah why would you do  it um but that's why I  and I'll play Max Payne  yeah I played the  original one I think way  back when so I I always  will try the Rockstar  games beyond that I'm  I mean it's been  downhill since NBA Jam  for me that that's  that's just that's just  me though NBA Jam  Sega Genesis um they  made it for Nintendo  too right not Nintendo  Nintendo not NBA  Super Nintendo had it  Super Nintendo Sega  Genesis they had it 
[03:37:30]  where you had cheat  codes where you could  put them in and play  as celebrities and  President Clinton  big heads yeah Barney  the dinosaur it was  it was ridiculous insane  I didn't know any of  those cheat codes I just  played as Muggsy Bogues  every time um he also  Laszlo he's a valuable  person to get information  from because he  reinforces my belief  that there's no reason  to ever leave the  United States of  America he was he was  sitting there and  talking about all these  you know the the uh 
[03:38:00]  dangerous places he went  to in Brazil when he  was in Sao Paulo and how  he had to have security  guards in his car and  checking for bombs and  trying to get into the  bank it was like Anthony  said it was like he was  living a video game I  don't like to travel  outside the outside of  the country well you  have yeah I have I used  to live outside the  country but that was  England England safe  that's except even  England isn't that safe  because England's the  only place where there  are bomb threats in the 
[03:38:30]  school and it's like  it's like having a fire  alarm like oh yeah we  got out early because  there was a bomb threat  today we'd have a bomb  threat at least once a  year and it just meant  you get out of school  early news like no no  because it's it's I  don't know if it's IRA  or what it is but they  just go oh we had a  bomb threat you guys  can all go home and  that was it nobody was  nervous hmm that  doesn't fly here you  in the London area I  was outside of London  yeah okay because  that's pretty much just  like living in New York  City yeah I mean well  except everybody's got  accents and bad teeth 
[03:39:00]  that's the difference  okay and Harrods there's  no Harrods in the city  and what Harrods what's  that department store  oh they don't have one  in New York not that I  know of anyway um what  I was gonna talk about  though was uh the of  course we got back into  the shit table bit again  and how'd that go  all right the update on  that is that they  weren't able to pass a  girl shitting on a table  and somebody lying  underneath it they were 
[03:39:30]  not able to get that  passed that is not a bit  that we're gonna be able  to do unfortunately uh I  what if we do it without  asking that would still uh  I mean they're literally  people are right down the  hall to say stop doing  that plus we'd have to  have people come in here  and that people would  notice if we were bringing  in human beings and  tables people would figure  out what we were doing  um but what I was gonna  say was I still and Opie and  Anthony haven't admitted  it but I believe this bid  was simply proposed out of 
[03:40:00]  spite and uh they just  wanted to make management's  lives more difficult and say  no you have to pitch this  to the lawyers even though  everybody knew this was  never gonna pass and uh  part of that was yesterday  Travis I don't know if  this whatever I don't  Travis um he had to write  the most ridiculous corporate  email that he said he's  ever had to write where he  had to actually send to  management a corporate email  writing up the details of how 
[03:40:30]  the shit on a table bit  would really work which  means that today it's going  to be Travis writing a  corporate email setting it  down to management imagine  if you who work a lot of  you I'm sure work in  corporate America imagine  if you were right you know  how this corporate email  system works and you have  to go up the chain of  command and you have to  make the boss make sure the  bosses see it and  everything's in print this is  what Travis has to do he  has to explain the girls 
[03:41:00]  shitting on a table with  Opie and Anthony lying  under it bit so that they  can properly pitch it to  the lawyers now I can only  imagine Travis is going to  have to formally pitch the  Cleveland steamer bit which  Jim thought of today which  is we get biohazard bags  girls take them into the  bathroom they exit the  bathroom however they got it  there I don't know they exit  the bathroom with that  biohazard bag full of  something I would assume it's 
[03:41:30]  species and whoever has the  heaviest bag wins the contest  tickets to Norton's gig some  cash whatever it is I think  the bit will work but I think  it's just the fact that  Travis has to write these up  in an email is what makes it  all worthwhile to me I don't  think it's gonna get through  you don't think that one's  gonna get through they're not  shitting on the air I know but  I would love to see that it  may be a good compromise and  I'm hoping but I don't they'll 
[03:42:00]  find some reason but we could  also incorporate it with the  other bit idea we had  yesterday after we weigh the  bags we could see who could  kick their shit the farthest  just keep it in the bags you  know what I mean kick it right  back in and I think those bags  are probably odor proof so I  mean as long as you time in a  knot at the top I should be  fine they're usually red right  yeah yeah ones in hospital yeah  they're biohazard bags I would  think but again that's a  question for Travis he's the  one who's putting a formal 
[03:42:30]  business pitch together and  today's today for those of you  keeping track at home is  Opie and Anthony staff meeting  day so you know this is gonna  come up what are you groaning  for I forgot they were asking  where it looks like we're doing  the live show in Cleveland and  it's been asked for bits that  are Cleveland associated to be  thought about for what we can do  when we're there Cleveland  steamer works to me you know  yeah Cleveland steamer in 
[03:43:00]  Cleveland shitting in bags  seeing which one is the  heaviest um there's the mouse  working Tom you're on after  Opie and Anthony live hey  what's up buddy why you don't  do the shit show in the  bathroom this show do it in the  bathroom not your show oh the  shitting on the table oh the  actual shit show yeah bring the  tables into the bathroom well I  still think so then we do the  bit because we couldn't then we  have to broadcast from the 
[03:43:30]  bathroom and I think we can't  broadcast the act of defecation  uh well still I think I think you  could probably pull it off you did in  the bathroom you think so that's the  loop everybody does you know y'all are  y'all are sneaky anyhow so what's you  know and if there's any sort of uh uh  uh you know worry as to the lawyers  like look this is not something we can  do uh Travis when he's writing the  formal pitch for this will also go out  and he'll get books that are called 
[03:44:00]  everybody poops and he'll give a copy  of everybody poops to each lawyer and  say see it's not a dirty thing it's  nothing we have to worry about  everybody poops some do it on the  table it's all good thank you Tom  all right so yeah we're good uh grant you  wanted to get in on this too here on  after opening anthony live yeah Sam uh I  transport medical waste that's my job  yeah these those medical waste bags  are not odorless even if you tie them in 
[03:44:30]  a knot at the top of them nah the red  trash bags oh so now what would we need  you you you handle medical waste what  type of things would we need for a girl  to shit in a bathroom privately off the  air and for her to come out of that  room with the medical waste bag full of  shit will we need the hazmat suits  will we need professional handlers  I don't think you need a hazmat suit  but uh you might need something  professional what about like Sal was 
[03:45:00]  saying yesterday like in the beginning  the opening credits of the Simpsons  where Homer has those tongs that he  uses to pick up the nuclear stick would  we need a pair of tongs like that to  hold the bag yeah maybe maybe that  would work and when you will you you are  used to uh dealing with medical waste do  you believe that the heavier bag will  be a larger amount of shit or a denser  shit  uh probably go denser denser okay that's a 
[03:45:30]  good guess thank you grant yeah thanks  man uh Travis we were just talking a  minute ago about I didn't know you had a  co-host today  well Eric assigns the interns to run the  board and then he just sits in here  that's his new thing  I was in the office and I just turned to  Danny I was like I feel so bad for Sam  he's trying so hard to get something  going and Eric's just not giving  anything back  were you noticing  I was noticing that you were really  trying to get a conversation about this  shit thing going and Eric's just like  yeah  yeah what are you gonna do  I don't think it's gonna work 
[03:46:00]  that's Eric though every now and then  did you read um Eric was bothering me  last night while we're talking about  what Eric does that bothers me  because he does because sometimes on the air  he'll go with the conversation he doesn't  know he's doing it other times he won't  say anything he's got his feet up he's  like yeah and then the third yeah he's  more casual in here because he's like  well I don't have to host it I'll just  stare at the guy who does and the third  option is he throws something at me  that's not at all what we're talking  about it's not at all the angle we  were going whatsoever and it's I just 
[03:46:30]  have to disregard it and move along as  if nobody had said anything like the  NWO exactly yesterday he's sitting  there critic first of all I don't like  internet people who criticize wrestling  because I think they're stupid because  they don't know what they're talking  about and what happens every person on  the internet who criticizes what's  going on on Monday Night Raw or  whatever by the time they get to the  end of the episode or the payoff of the  storyline everything that they were  criticizing usually makes sense and  they go oh okay I get it now and they 
[03:47:00]  like it all right but while it's going  on they have to criticize it Eric not  only I didn't criticize not only does he  insist on criticizing storylines they're  going on on wrestling but it's  criticisms aren't even accurate they  don't make sense and I'm just like the  question I'm just like what the fuck is  he talking about like I'm not going to  get too much into wrestling because we're  trying to talk about shit here okay  that's what the people can relate to  but Eric he's going off and he's  saying something like isn't this CM Punk  Chris Jericho story the same as the 
[03:47:30]  rock John Cena I said similar no you said  the same as I know what like two male  wrestlers no it's not the same at all  it's not even it's not similar it's  just two guys that are in a large main  event scale feud and then was he proven  wrong at the end of the episode it was  proven wrong at the beginning while he  was criticizing it no there's  similarities like what and then he's  he's tweeting Chad Dukes is a guy who  does radio in DC sure and he's Eric  at him all the time of course because  he's a wrestling fan and Chad Dukes by  the way he is also one he's a very 
[03:48:00]  critical wrestling fan he's a little more  of the Eric school of thought than I am  but he's not as nonsensical as Eric is  when it comes school of thought if if  if I'm not mistaken is everything leads  back to NWO reforming you know how on  the show yes yes that's 100% true Eric  you know how on the show Jim we say his  train of thought always goes back to you  are molested as a child when you talk  about wrestling with Eric somehow it  always boils down to the NWO coming back 
[03:48:30]  that's all Eric wants to see in wrestling  I didn't bring that up they come back  and everything you didn't bring that up  this time but I'm sure if we had talked  for any length of time something would  have come back with the NWO coming back  that's all you want to see in wrestling  okay this is John from WWE is on the phone  I'm assuming and it's on the hotline  John yes thank you very much John 
[03:49:00]  Roland if you want to talk you can come  down here and talk but even Chad Dukes  yesterday who's again more of the Eric  school of thought but his stuff actually  sometimes makes sense said no dude  they're they're not the same and then  Eric tried to justify it and then he  again said yeah bro it's something  different no it's a little gun shy with 
[03:49:30]  his criticism is that what you're saying  no Iraq yeah he's not gun shy at all he  just goes not not not gun shy you know  quick on the draw quick on the draw and  he's totally off wasn't a criticism it  was asking a question but it was it's  like where are you getting this from  because some of the things they were  saying seem similar to the Roxy and  these guys don't like each other and  those guys don't like each other or  John Cena and the Rock just talking  about wrestling a WrestleMania exactly  the now now these guys are wrestling a 
[03:50:00]  WrestleMania come on Vince think of  something new I am NOT that fan yes you  are you know you don't even realize it  but you are no I am NOT Travis as an  outsider do you think he doesn't even  know do you think he's that I read the  tweets okay you know what up in my  timeline and you know what that fan is  that Eric's describing right yeah do  you think Eric's that fan he borders on  it yeah he's there I never claimed to  have any kind of inside track on shit or  nose I say shit to you no you put it out  there on Twitter and I'm like fuck I'm 
[03:50:30]  not gonna respond to him I'm not going to  respond to him I'm not legit and then I  have to write back no stupid no I mean I  like talking wrestling there are people  from the organization that write back  and like my inquiries listen Joe Vila  writes to you because he's your friend  and he doesn't want you to feel bad but  he has to know that your shit makes no  sense yeah I'm sure he knows that in his  heart of hearts uh-huh he's a nice guy  yeah like and so he thinks that when 
[03:51:00]  you're friends with somebody you should be  nice to them I'm not that guy like I can  be friends with somebody and still be  like no that's just dumb thing to say  and if they say dumb things a lot to me  I'll say it a lot have you not noticed  there's been a lot more since you brought  to uh you brought up to everyone's  attention that you don't like my  predictions on things have you noticed  it's been a lot more you've been a lot  more public with your predictions there  you go it's just but yesterday was it  was a legitimate question that's all it 
[03:51:30]  was I know yeah and it was it wasn't a  criticism it was a question Eric says  isn't Punk's beef with Jericho the same  storyline as Roxina no no it's not even  close mm-hmm um then okay and then Sam  chimed in yeah and then shut up he ended  with violently I hate your wrestling  opinions violently trying to get in bed and  relax and watch wrestling and then I turn  it on I'm like let me see what's tweeting  maybe I'll throw something out and every 
[03:52:00]  time without fail Eric's like hey have  you ever noticed how no that doesn't  ever happen then Eric retorted I don't  know he said Jericho thinks people rip  him off Punk says Jericho leaves and  comes back when he wants seems similar no  it's not I like a guy who doesn't back  down from his terrible thoughts though  yeah he's like look I'll run into the  ground whether I'm right or wrong I'm  sticking by this everybody's saying oh  Jesus I'm getting all frustrated the same  two people who always defend Eric or 
[03:52:30]  feedback me and Sam leave Eric alone and  who no no no no these are Iraq supporters  oh saying Sam leave I'm leaving Eric  alone we're having a conversation about  his thoughts is Eric not man enough that  he can't defend his own thoughts who kid  you're in here you've had to deal with  management before I know I hate it DJ who  kid from shape 45 Travis I don't know if  you were listening before I said you're  out of the office but you had to write a  formal proposal who kid yesterday on the 
[03:53:00]  Opie and Anthony show we pitched this  idea and I stand by the fact that I  believe Opie and Anthony came up with  this idea and stood by it only because it  would make management's lives more  difficult when they had to pitch this to  lawyers and stuff okay because the bit is  we bring in glass coffee tables Opie and  Anthony lay down under the coffee tables  with microphones and everything no way  and then we get girls to come in stand on  top of the coffee tables and shit what 
[03:53:30]  yeah that's the bit get out of here yeah  and they say I don't understand why this  wouldn't be passed and our bosses are  like look we want to work with you but  this is obscenity this is defecation on  the air it can't happen nobody it can't be  approved but they're insisting that it be  approved to the point where our our bosses  who talk to the lawyers they're like  look will you take it from me this won't  get approved Opie and Anthony go no you  have to pitch it to the lawyers just like 
[03:54:00]  brats and so and so Travis right there  you know Travis he had to write an email  to our boss to his boss explaining in a  corporate style like a corporate email  saying it was very professional this is  what this is the bit what the bit entails  that Opie and Anthony are proposing and it  was the shit on the table bit the original  the original subject was the shit bit but I  realized that's not professional so I  changed it to in studio bit there were 
[03:54:30]  words like defecation proposed in my god and so today are you gonna have to write a cleveland steamer just I haven't been asked yet but I know it's gonna happen it's probably gonna probably gonna happen so there was actually defecation going on in here from a girl's no that's what they wanted  oh the compromise they've made it looks like we're doing a live show in Cleveland yeah we made a  compromise I think it's is it at the end of March or April April okay in April looks like we're gonna do a live show in Cleveland it looks good and they want to do we want we as a show want to do bits that somehow incorporate Cleveland so today the bosses told us point blank look you there are cases where this is proven as obscenity we cannot do the shit on a table bit on the air 
[03:55:00]  the bosses told us point blank look you there are cases where this is proven as obscenity we cannot do the shit on a table bit on the air it just can't happen and so the compromise was and Jim came up with this can't be serious he said okay here's what we'll do it's called the Cleveland steamer oh and we're gonna have a bunch of girls and they're gonna take biohazard waste bags and they're gonna take them into the bathroom with them they're gonna shit in them off the air 
[03:55:30]  off the air totally PC you can't make this up huh right and then they're gonna come out of the bathroom and we're gonna weigh the bags and whoever has the heaviest shit wins the cash prize that's some real shit right there right now Travis is this something you're looking forward to to like to actually do to no to write up as like a corporate proposal you know I mean I just do what I'm asked so because then the next I gotta write two shit emails in two days 
[03:56:00]  does the city of Cleveland approve this I don't know that's something we're still in the development stages why don't I just shit on LeBron jerseys that's a good idea they will definitely approve that  wrap up the LeBron jersey that'd be hot who kid that'd be shit that's the real shit right there maybe you could propose uh maybe you could be a producer for the show get like fat bitches and shit  you think so yeah I don't like sexy women shitting you want fat bitches shitting I think they'll look better if it's a fat bitch shit 
[03:56:30]  that's what you want to say like if you were gonna watch the video I want fat bitches you want fat bitches Travis can you incorporate fat bitches  some heavy shit too I don't have a problem with fat bitches you know what I would like it's a shame that that you know part of the deal is that we can't see these women shitting  maybe if we can get like refrigerator boxes to to cover the women but we can still see the shit falling we just want to see out of the box 
[03:57:00]  okay but it's but it's past their ass cheeks yeah oh yeah so we're not actually seeing we're just seeing it  you can't see a fat chick shitting though they're so fat you can't see it come out that's true  it's like a fat dude you know like a fat dude you don't know where his dick is right they'd have to be  I don't know I haven't looked either but that's what girls tell me I don't know whatever you say  whatever you say um okay Brad in Cleveland actually wants to rename this bit uh Brad you're on after  opening Anthony live what's up buddy how you doing how you doing Brad not too bad I got a perfect name 
[03:57:30]  for it called the glass bottom boat glass bottom boat if we can pass the table bit I think glass  bottom boat is good Danny and I've been thinking of ideas to name this bit because I mean it's shitting  is this the table bit or the Cleveland steamer bit both of them because I mean there's just you know  there's the perfect name out there you know you're dealing with shit and tables and and and women  shitting into bags and there's just a name that you know it's out there you haven't thought of it  yet have you thought of any names yet yeah no called the pool party the what the pool party 
[03:58:00]  poop party yeah the pool party it's dj who gets poop party club greenhouse shit all the bro  um scott on rhode island I say on because it's an island you're on the after show how's it going guys  what's up scott hey dr gay how's it going too uh well yeah that's that travis goes by dr gay on  the air because he's a doctor and he's gay I mean you know every human is gay yeah that's that's normal 
[03:58:30]  right it's true are they dr happy we're born gay first okay I just wanted to uh go back with uh with  e-rock I think e-rock's a hundred percent right about what's going on uh on raw here cm punk is  talking about uh jericho going back with dancing with the stars and taking off everything and the  rock soon as they uh johnson has done the same thing with the rock okay johnson has been doing  that with the rock for a year cm punk said one sentence about it that's not the crux of their 
[03:59:00]  feud same thing their feud is about who's the best not who was on dancing with the stars  dr gay exactly that's how e-rock gets out of it okay just a question let's hit it back to dr gay  um eric would just angrily cross it off his list okay  give up with that that's what eric does eric eric e-rock sits in meetings and uh he'll come up with a 
[03:59:30]  bit and uh i'll just one of us will be like i don't think that works and then eric will go no  i think it would and then somebody else will say no eric it really doesn't work and one of the bosses  will say yeah we probably scrapped that or or or we'll say what if we change it this way we'll say  what if we change the bit to this and eric goes okay and he takes out his pen and he angrily scribbles  out everything on his page dr gay everybody has to go eric no no relax dr gay wasn't trying to put 
[04:00:00]  you in a bad mood here but you don't like it when people disagree with you just certain people yeah  who the staff staff me no you don't care when i do it no i know who it is who isn't who do you see  who do you think it is no one in this room danny i don't even think danny troy it's all troy roland  no you think it's one of the bosses yeah you think it's gary rob both gary and rob you don't like  when gary and rob disagree with you i didn't say anything you see what happens well look we've all 
[04:00:30]  trashed everybody's you know bit ideas like that's part of of coming up with bits how many how many  shitty things have we thought of yeah you know before we think of something good we've all had  stuff turned down yeah but it's just unfortunately eric has never had anything approved so i'm kidding  eric you've had lots of stuff approved you know that name one worst of the week  guests hosting the worst of the week countdown yeah actually that wasn't approved done without  permission i got a phone call on that one who did from who who called you somebody because we were 
[04:01:00]  talking earlier on the show nothing overly bad we were talking earlier on the show eric hosts the  worst of the week countdown on the weekends um and we were talking about how now because he got in  trouble well we both got in trouble for uh not hosting it for a while eric does it passive  aggressively because he was told look this is one of your responsibilities just please host the  countdown so eric said fine i'll host it but he does it like he's holding his breath and counting  to them like he he does it completely i should totally do that next week passive aggressively and 
[04:01:30]  sometimes he just says the intros as quick as he possibly can like the guy from the micro  machines commercials sometimes he just says nothing about the bit and last week he decided to pull  random people into studios and say guest host for a week countdown i looked for you but you  weren't around oh man i wish i was here so i got travis what did me who madison what did they say  julia mina and sal i barely know who these people are so you know the listeners have no relation to it 
[04:02:00]  what did uh what did the call say um i'm assuming it was rob well yeah well that's a conversation for  another time well what did he say just that uh how come everybody can be honest except you what did  he say they weren't aware that this was happening and you were like look rob we've been here before  this doesn't i didn't want to promote it i said look i'm trying to be creative i guess shut up you  didn't want to promote it you didn't want to do it and you didn't want them to know that no one  they you know promote everything they didn't know so we couldn't promote it so i was like there 
[04:02:30]  was no point in promoting it was just supposed to be out of nowhere this week on worst of the week  countdown it's mina and travis because that's really going to drive the listeners it's amazing  you know what you know what i was asking did the paperwork go to bladder did he approve the shit  thing not yet uh why why do you ask i don't know you know he's like uh you know he's a defecating  guy i don't know maybe i mean we're all defecating guys i mean the bladder you know it blends with 
[04:03:00]  bladder right i guess so oh but urine comes out of the bladder right urine urine comes out of the  bladder that's number one defecation is number two i don't know if the hip-hop community is aware of  this i don't think so either oh when i really get bladder in here  you always have to bring a fart sign when you need it you always have to bring him up  that's why we have you back on though um i really wanted to talk about we have no time to talk about  it i wanted to talk about what they talked about at the top of the hour which was bullying kids when 
[04:03:30]  you're in high school and not even realizing the damage that you're doing to them psychologically  right did you pick on kids travis or did you get picked on i picked on kids dr gay picked on you  dr gay used to pick on kids it was before i was dr gay but you did you of course i did i picked on  i mean horribly we got to talk about this tomorrow eric we can easily do an hour is there such a thing  as a gay bully i i mean am i making this up dr gay yes no this is a bit oh oh i didn't know i don't 
[04:04:00]  know what's a bit anymore um eric on it tell me the truth yeah did you pick on kids or did you get  picked on tell me the fucking truth shut the fuck up and let me answer i don't know if you're lying  all right i did not get bullied because i knew enough in all the little groups i knew enough  people there so i really didn't get fucked with that's how i was yeah but i don't remember bullying  anybody either i think you might have got bullied a little no because i would have good stories if i  was you're either a bully or you get bullied i bet eric like kind of bullied like because he had a lot 
[04:04:30]  of money and yeah living in florida you bully a lot of people anyway yeah i'm gonna go out of my  people's houses and and cars without them knowing who exactly did it that's funny did you ever uh  when you were in school go up to a white kid and say let me hold a quarter and never pay him the  quarterback because that happened to me a few times let me hold a quarter i don't know i don't i don't  remember doing that listen we'll talk about bullying tomorrow because ron and fez got to pick up
