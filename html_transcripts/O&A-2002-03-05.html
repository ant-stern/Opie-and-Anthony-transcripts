<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast unfolded as a chaotic whirlwind of internal conflict, on-air blunders, and wildly inappropriate conversations.  The day began with a four-hour pre-show standoff between Opie and Anthony and their boss, Ken Stevens, over management's attempts to curb the show's notoriously unrestrained content.  This tension set the tone for the entire broadcast.

The show itself started with a pre-recorded segment hosted by recurring guest Gay Marco, featuring highly explicit and sexually suggestive phone calls and reenactments of gay pornography, with Adam Ferrari present in the studio.  Opie and Anthony then returned to the air, openly discussing their battle with management and the unusual circumstances leading to the pre-recorded segment, culminating in a scheduled, somewhat structured meeting with Ken (no yelling, limited cursing).  They briefly touched on upcoming segments, including the "55-gallon drum challenge."

The incompetence of their New Orleans affiliate, Tom (apparently still drunk from Mardi Gras), was a major focus.  Tom's errors included misprinting Extreme Radio t-shirts and submitting illegible advertising copy.  Repeated calls to Tom, punctuated by increasingly absurd excuses (blaming a promotion girl and referencing Stonehenge and a boa constrictor), only amplified the hosts' frustration, with phrases like "what a complete horse's ass" frequently used.  Similar problems arose with the Premier Mitsubishi commercial copy, riddled with grammatical errors and awkward phrasing, including a jab at Anthony's bad credit, even after an Emmy-award-winning writer attempted to fix it.  A listener, Pete, also called in to lambaste Tom and the station's technical issues, even making disparaging comments about Tom's wife.  The segment degenerated further with calls to Tom’s beer store cashier and a random woman in the parking lot deemed the "ugliest woman," who quickly hung up.

The show then delved into a satirical discussion of newly released Richard Nixon tapes, mimicking Nixon's bigoted views, his nuclear threats in Vietnam, and his casual attitude toward groping women. This segued into an account of Earl, a show employee, damaging a microphone after an awkward attempt to ask a co-worker, Nadine, for a date to Eddie Trunk's (the groom) wedding, with Nadine's discomfort and Earl’s outburst fueling the ensuing discussion.

The next segment involved a multi-layered narrative.  It started with the Earl/Nadine/wedding debacle, further complicated by Nadine’s intoxicated confession at a party.  The discussion transitioned to listener calls about a show segment featuring a woman putting out a cigarette on her tongue, which spawned suggestions for more extreme stunts, including the introduction of a "dumpster chick." This led to a heated, profanity-laced argument between a female guest, Carrie, and a staff member, Rick, culminating in Carrie's departure from the studio and continued insults and threats after she left.  The segment also included a call with Ebony, a Black woman, which involved casual racism, discussions of crime, and stereotypes about different racial groups, with caller Joe adding to the candid (and offensive) nature of the conversation.  The segment concluded with a discussion of a stunt featuring Spaz and Stinky impersonating Opie and Anthony for a BBC interview.

The final segment featured a phone call with a British radio station. The conversation ranged from a comparison of US and UK nudity laws, to a boast about a $1000 bounty for on-air breast exposure two years prior, to commentary on British royalty (the Queen Mum, Britney Spears and Prince William, and the Queen Mum's hygiene).  Anthony’s poor Andrew Dice Clay impression led to exclamations of injury. This segment also included a surprise in-studio appearance by Tom Brokaw, who delivered a bizarre statement about Britney Spears' attractiveness and his belief that Prince William was gay.  Alec Guinness also received posthumous disparagement. The British hosts' increasing discomfort was palpable, culminating in the American hosts mocking their shock at the interview's chaotic nature. The show ended with plans to repeat similar stunts.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  you're fired  nah, I don't think so  great  how you guys doing?  oh, pretty effing good, Tom  just, just great  get out of my sight  and you tell everybody else to stay the hell out of my sight  yeah  and welcome to the O.B. and Anthony show 
[00:00:30]  hey  the short version of the O.B. and Anthony show today  yeah, it's going to be about three minutes long  a couple phone numbers in the New York area  why?  so they can call us tomorrow  all right  877-692-1027  anywhere else outside of New York  give us a call  866-277  for a while  got eyes staring at us all over the place 
[00:01:00]  so we better not say the wrong thing, Anthony  whoa  we're all paranoid that we're live on the radio today  uh-oh  for about  two more minutes  because God knows  what we say is the word of God  right  oh  hours  we just spent four hours  um, um, discussing if we should go on the air today  yeah 
[00:01:30]  phone calls, uh  Opie on, on his desk phone  uh, in one ear  uh, in one ear  the cell phone on the other  person on the desk phone  talking with somebody else on their desk phone  uh, on another line  two offices down  so we absolutely  you know how we talk about how we don't prep for this show  you know  we at least discuss a couple of things  we weren't even able to do that today  weren't even able to do that today  with all these phone meetings 
[00:02:00]  with the intermediaries  we were talking, uh  to the boss  through our agent  through our agent  who's in LA  yeah  so the agent was on the phone with us  in our office  yeah  and on the other line  he was on the phone with our boss  right  who's, uh  oh, I don't know  20 feet away  20 feet away  how ridiculous is that?  for four straight hours 
[00:02:30]  and we don't see the boss until  the, the music started for the show  and he wants to have more  telling us that he wants to have more talking  and more meeting  more talking and more meetings  right now  right this minute  so I guess that's what we're gonna do  yeah  so now we gotta, like, uh  go into a little talk  talkie meeting  the face-to-face talkie meeting  I didn't realize I had so much power, Anthony  yes  we could affect everybody else's career around us 
[00:03:00]  I didn't know that  of course  all I know is  when I got into radio  I thought I could, um, uh  I don't know  state my opinions  no  and then, you know  maybe some people would agree  with what I have to say  and others, of course  would, would not agree  with what I have to say  but at least I could, uh  state my, uh  my thoughts  and my opinions  on a radio show  at least that's what  this show's about  but for some reason  I learned, uh  very recently  uh, I don't know  people take what we say  very seriously  and we can affect  everybody around us  it affects things  which I think is 
[00:03:30]  absolutely insane  but that's what people  around here think  we have so much power  that we can affect  a domino theory  a domino principle  of, of, uh  hell  that will just  tear everything up  and I  our whole careers  have taken pride  in the fact that  uh, we  would never use  any type of power  that we  we, uh  we get in this business  to tell  uh, management  or, uh  other, uh  radio shows  that they can't  talk about us  yeah  we've taken on 
[00:04:00]  all, all  freaking  combatants  it's sometimes  it's very brutal  uh, it's brutally  honest  and, uh  we, we  never enjoy  being in the  position where  we can't  just  speak our minds  uh, only  under the  constraints of  the FCC  you know  we can't be  blurting out  the F word  and stuff like that  and that's fine  we've gotten  around that  but this show  and Opie and I  are not used to  dealing in a 
[00:04:30]  form where we  cannot  speak openly  and honestly  and let the  listeners in on  what we're talking  about  and just plain  vent  that's what this  show is  has always been  about  and we wanted  to continue  to be  about that  they might  as well  just hand us  a list  of all  the people  we can't  talk about  every day  so we're  all on the  same page  right  because it  started with  one  started with  one thing  we can't  talk about  one person  and then 
[00:05:00]  the list  just what  it starts  building  and then  where does  it stop  and  you know  so there's  been this  whole thing  going on  today  phone calls  meetings  and we  haven't  been able  to even  touch on  the show  at all  and Ken  is shaking  like he has  epilepsy  he's freaking  out  so concerned  that we have  to have a  meeting  like right  now  so they  want us 
[00:05:30]  to do a  radio show  and ignore  the fact  that there's  been some  big changes  in Philadelphia  radio  Anthony  there you go  Philadelphia  radio  good bad  or indifferent  there's big  things happening  in Philly  it's up to  the listeners  not us  we can't  touch on it  because for  some weird  reason  whatever we  say will  be taken  as the  word of  God  and people  will do  exactly  what we  say  right  that's what  I've learned  the last two  days  we got a lot  of power  apparently  stupid power  in their 
[00:06:00]  eyes  apparently  so  so now  we're going  to go down  the hall  and talk  some more  we'll talk  for the  first time  I guess  great  lots of  fun  wonderful  what a  hoot  so uh  where's  Rick  yeah  time to  play the  old beat  up uh  archive  bits  again  just answering 
[00:06:30]  people  unbelievable  it's a  hell of a  way to  run a  ship  Joyce  writes  Opie  you've  always been  the first  to say  that you  don't trust  anybody in  the radio  business  I'm a little  surprised that  you got  caught up in  feeling that  you could be  friendly with  some of  these people  around you  yeah you're  right  I've changed  my whole way  of thinking  as far as  that goes  I gave it  a shot  I gave it 
[00:07:00]  a shot  I don't  trust anyone  except Ant  that's it  it's back  to that  which means  it's going  to be some  good radio  in the future  I gave it a  try the other  way  that didn't  work out  did it  not really  no  so uh  what do we  do  where's  Rick  go to  spots  at 308  great  great  bye bye  the 55  gallon drum 
[00:07:30]  challenge  will happen  Friday  I'm assuming  I'm assuming  yeah  I mean  and you  know what  sorry  I gotta  answer people  on instant  feedback  and the  you know  what  are they  gonna ban  the bell  they're gonna  probably  take my  bell away  because I'm  actually  answering  and the  bosses assume  that it's  just easy  to walk  down the  hall  and uh  and do  what they  tell us  to do  like uh 
[00:08:00]  you know  we really  don't want  you talking  about this  yeah  and then  they get  disappointed  when we  come in  here and  we react  to something  that's what  we do  that's our  jobs  we made  a living  off reacting  and talking  about the  hot topic  of the  day  that's  what this  show's  always been  about  so to go  on the air  and make  believe all  this crap  isn't going  on and move  forward  is completely  ridiculous  we're not  supposed to  address  the show  has always  been about  that  that's what  he doesn't  understand  so Ken 
[00:08:30]  doesn't get  and it doesn't  matter a million  meetings it's not  going to get  we're not going  to come away  agreeing with  each other  how can we  walk down  the hall  and not  address the  fact that  it is  extremely  uncomfortable  in this  building  huh  we're not  supposed to  talk about  plenty of  shows  would be  able to  do  that  they come  on  you go  through  your  prepared  stuff  and you  know  you do  your bits  and what  not  but this 
[00:09:00]  show isn't  about that  it never  has been  the success  we've had  is based  is based on  the fact  that we  talk about  things that  that no  one's going  to be  talking about  and some  things that  are quite  frankly a  little  uncomfortable  for everyone  us included  but now I'm  finding out  that that's  not good  enough  because what  we say  is pretty  powerful  Anthony  we can  influence  all the  radio  listening in  the country  by what we  have to  say  that's how  powerful you  and I  have become  right  we should 
[00:09:30]  just get  a list of  radio shows  we like  and don't  like  and we'll  just tell  you guys  and then  we'll  control  the entire  country  wouldn't that  be great  we'll pick  the shows  you guys  should listen  to  we're going  to tell  you  because we're  that powerful  that's what  we're learning  because you  guys are a  bunch of  robots  Rick you got  a list of  all the  hack bits  we're going  to be playing  today  yeah this is  smart  this makes  for good  radio  yeah great 
[00:10:00]  yeah  four hours  before the  show  four straight  hours nothing  got accomplished  so now we  have to play  old tired  bits today  and nothing  will get  accomplished  between now  and seven  down the  hall  that's great  too yeah  instead of  hanging out  in here  having some  fun with  the listeners  we got to  go down and  sit in that  office  oh by the  every single  phone call 
[00:10:30]  that got  through to  us  yeah we  can't talk  about that  no  no  no  no  you're not  calling in  about that  no Bruce  sorry  no Tom  sorry  sorry  Steve  sorry  Jerry  Pat  Kevin  Dave  Dima  Frank  John  sorry  can't talk  to you  can't talk  about it  and we got  to make  believe we  don't even  see you  but we're  supposed to do  a show  right  why doesn't  Ken sit in  the seat  and find out  how easy  it is to  do that  sorry Chris 
[00:11:00]  Dave  Rachel  Tom  Mike  James  same thing  oh one  guy wants to  talk about  Sims golf  that's good  all right  well  hope this  doesn't take  too long  I'm going to  go blade in  the park  because that's  what I want  to do  today  all right  let's 
[00:11:30]  let's go  have fun  with Ken  it's going  to be a  a hoot  it's going  to yell  at us  all right  me and you  make a deal  the first  raised voice  from him  we're  we're  just  go home  go  go home  I don't want  to hear it  I don't want  to  I'm a  little too  mature  at this  point in  my life  to be  yelled at  by a  man 
[00:12:00]  and quite  frankly I  think I  think we've  done a lot  for this  place in  New York  right  I don't  think we  deserve to  be yelled  at  yell  we walk  I think  we did  a bang  up job  there in  Philly  bringing a  lot of  people on  board  to the  Opian  Anthony  show  in  Philly  and  Boston  and I  truly  do not  think that  I should  be sitting  there  at this  point in  my life  being yelled  at by  another  grown man 
[00:12:30]  if he  yells or  slams his  fist on  anything  yeah  Cleveland  Buffalo  yeah  so I  think we're  you know  doing our  part  to the  point where  I don't  have to  sit there  while somebody  tries to  make me  feel like  I'm  10  and  you know  I'll state  this for the  record  when it comes  right down  to it  I really  don't care  what other  radio shows  you guys  listen to  I really  don't 
[00:13:00]  but I want  to be able  to give my  opinions on  what  Ant and I  do  maybe the  business  in general  maybe some  of the  other shows  that are out  there  right  that's what  I want  to do  I want  to be able  to react  and speak  my mind  but when  it comes  the same  freedoms  that are  given to  those  very shows  too  by the way  but when  I could  when it  comes  when it  comes down  to it  I could  give a  flying F  what other  shows you  guys listen  to  nope  I'm  concerned  with this  program  period  and I  want to  play by  the same 
[00:13:30]  rules  uh-huh  I want  to be able  to mention  that  right  I want  to be able  to mention  that  why be  singled  out  driving in  today  I heard  allowed to  why  I don't  I just  want to  play by  the same  rules  not even  bashing  but I guess  we're so  powerful  that we  have a  whole  different  set of  rules  Anthony  not even  bashing  just talking

[00:22:00]  some of the ideas from my column in today's show as well as you know some other fun and exciting  little things as well okay i'm big dick black  well squeeze it  well one thing i did want to include was a co-host but as you see i'm going solo today 
[00:22:30]  and those of you who read my column know my dream co-host was froy from opie anthony message board  anyways we met here in the studio about six  we met here in the studio about six weeks ago and it was love at first sight for me 
[00:23:00]  he is so hot and he's very young but he's really hot i don't know how young he is and i'm not quite  sure what constitutes statutory rape in new jersey but he's still very hot and he's straight he's very  straight but he's hot and all you single girls in new jersey um you know look him up because he's  single and he's sexy and he's funny and he's hung did i say that oh no um excuse me i am so i  contacted froy asking him if he would be my co-host and he said unfortunately he had to babysit after 
[00:23:30]  school so you know this made me realize i know why i don't date younger guys anymore because they're  always too busy with either their homework or band practice or detention so now i only date guys  so now i only date guys over 19 so  i decided to uh go to the message board because you know there's a lot of great talent on there  maybe i could find another co-host and first i thought um i really like fez not fez from ron and 
[00:24:00]  fez but fez from the message board and he's he's really very talented and he also writes a column  got milk he writes the second best column on foundrymusic.com and so i send him an email  excuse me  so i wrote fez and sight unseen i have no idea what he looks like so i didn't know what kind of 
[00:24:30]  chemistry we would have i still wrote him anyways but he was busy too so i kept searching through the  message board and finally i came to uh corpse grinder junk now i thought this was very interesting  because hey he has junk in his name and i like it in my mouth so i thought maybe we'd have something 
[00:25:00]  in common i'm just a flaming fag  but you know his pictures that he posts there are just really frightening i mean they really  really scare me so i passed on him and i figured i could go at it alone and give it my best shot so  here i am today and speaking of giving my best shot i have to say i love porn i love porn videos but  there's only two things i like about it i like the money shot and i like the dialogue that leads up 
[00:25:30]  to you know the sex part so you know you always have to fast forward to get to the dialogue um but  this past christmas i got a dvd player from one of my holiday boyfriends uh you know holiday  boyfriends are those boyfriends you just keep long enough through the holidays to get lots of  presents from and then you dump them afterwards you know you dump them actually before new year's you  tell them like uh you need to get in touch with yourself and you need your space and sometimes  it's going to have three or four of these because you get more presents but so i have this really  cool dvd player now and last week i got my first gay porn dvd saving ryan's privates 
[00:26:00]  turn it off  turn it off  turn it off  turn it off  so i was so excited i finally had a gay dvd and i could cut right to the dialogue parts and 
[00:26:30]  right to the money shots but you know it doesn't work that way you they only go right to the sex  part so you still have to fast forward to get to the dialogue i just don't understand it but  you know you really gotta love these flimsy movie plots when you're when you're telling these little  stories here's a good idea have a point it makes it so much more interesting for the listener hey 
[00:27:00]  so say hey saving private saving ryan's privates is a story of a boy from iowa who joins the service  and gets it and in the and everywhere else end of story so um now this you know this movie is a big  comeback for ryan idol he's a big porn star like years ago and one night he did too many drugs and  fell out a window or something and obviously he wasn't taking acting lessons while he was recovering  but now for your enjoyment i would like to reenact a critical scene can we see your stuff from saving 
[00:27:30]  ryan's privates you got me scene two into the office of the commanding officer walks private ryan  private ryan idol reporting for duty sir  petty son  yes sir  so how is the basic training coming along private ryan  sir it's very hard but i'm giving it my all sir  well it looks like to me like something else is pretty hard on you son 
[00:28:00]  this movie is so hot i have to tell you but you know what my problem is i just wish it was more  realistic now if they fill my life for a porn movie that would be realistic it could be called  manhattan manhandles marco now for your enjoyment  for your enjoyment i would like to reenact a critical scene  from this multi-award-winning film manhattan manhandles marco 
[00:28:30]  scene three after hours in the offices of wnew  oh no  roxy marco and rick  rick thanks for inviting me to the studio today  rick thanks for inviting me down to the studio today  rick

You're on the air with Gay Marco.  Hey, Marco.  Oh, you have a sexy voice.  That last bit just made me feel so gay.  Like, my sphincter is screaming just...  Anyway, the thing I...  Two questions for you.  Mm-hmm.  One is, um, what's the gay society's version of, like, the penis origami? 
[00:31:30]  Like, do you own a snakeskin watch?  No, I don't.  Um, the only trick I can do with my penis is make it disappear.  Oh, my God.  Goodbye.  Who else do we have on the line here?  Bill?  Hey.  Hey, Bill.  Oh, how gay are you?  I'm gay.  Oh, my God.  You know, hey, O&A, thanks a lot.  I picked today of all day.  All day I've been up, I figured I'd start folding clothes about 15 minutes ago. 
[00:32:00]  Bill?  I feel real feminine right now.  Bill, are you left-handed or right-handed?  Um, uh, what do you call that?  By, uh, whatever.  Ambidextrous?  Yeah, you got it.  Oh, good, then I can sit on either side of you at the circle.  Hey, there you go.  Hey, not only did you ruin my clothes folding, but you ruined ours.  I came and watched.  Jamie, you're on with gay Marco.  Yeah, dude, man, my junk is crawling back inside.  What is up with you? 
[00:32:30]  And congratulations to Rick on coming out of the closet.  I'm sitting on the side of 25A listening to this, and I can't, my sphincter is the size of, like, a pen right now.  Good.  I like him tight.  Well, he ain't getting anywhere near mine, bro.  Let me tell you that.  I just got, are you really for real?  I mean, O&A, is he really for real?  I'm the real thing.  Oh, my God.  God help us all.  Thank God you can't reproduce and get any more little gay Marcos going around.  I can't believe this. 
[00:33:00]  My call screener, Spanky, just brought this note to me.  Oh, my God.  I don't believe it.  I'm so upset.  I was planning on next doing my sports hunk segment, but my special guest star, Derek Jeter, well, it seems his manager called and says Derek is unable to make it because he has to report to Florida for spring training. 
[00:33:30]  Damn.  And I was looking forward to playing, try to get to third base with the shortstop.  So instead, we'll just have to play, guess what's in my ****?

I'm going to send you an autographed picture of me and Jay Moore having sex together.  Oh, I can't wait.  Well, wasn't that fun? 
[00:37:30]  Thank you for calling me.  You have a great show, Marco.  Thank you.  We'll get you.  We'll put you on hold.  We'll get your name and number, and we will send you that photo.  Can I just say one thing?  Sure.  I think your show should be regular.  Thank you, Angela.  Love you, baby.  No problem.  Bye.  Bye-bye.  Speaking of Jay Moore and some fun, you know, it's hard to believe it was a little over  a year ago, I was in this very studio, and Jay Moore was spanking me and drawing a bullseye  on my ass.  Many of you don't realize our breakup occurred a few months after that. 
[00:38:00]  Yes, while he was on the set of that Kevin Spacey film, Jay called me one night and said  that something had come between us, and I'm just wondering if it was someone who was on  that movie set, but I have to say that that person did me a favor, and today, Jay C is  my only true love.  Yes, this is the Gay Marco Show on 102.7 WNEW, and actually, I wrote a little column this  week about Valentine's Day, so be sure to check that out on Foundry Music, but I personally 
[00:38:30]  decided to remain single this Valentine's Day.  You know, swimsuit season's coming.  I didn't need any that could die of the chocolate, and I spent the day with my friend Steve, and  we went down to the meatpacking district, and had dinner at Pestis, and we sucked down  some mussels, and you know, the kind that come in a shell, and had a few Cosmos, and then  we decided to stroll around town, you know, down there, and you know, I didn't realize this,  but that's where all the transvestite hookers are, and I mean, I guess they don't call it 
[00:39:00]  the meatpacking district for nothing.  So, anyways, there's this really big, fat, nasty hooker, and she like looks at us, and  she goes, what are you two fags looking at?  And I'm like, well, we're not looking at you, you nasty old drag hag.  And so then we went running down the street like two little schoolgirls.  So, this morning, I'm lying in bed, thinking about this, and I'm like, I can't believe she  called us fags.  I mean, that's like the least offensive name to be called.  And are there really any names out there that would truly offend me? 
[00:39:30]  And suddenly, it hit me on the right cheek.  I still can't believe I can shoot that far.  But, so I was cleaning up.  While I was cleaning up, I had this brilliant idea for a new game.  The most offensive name game.  I want your most offensive names, besides fag, alright?  I want to hear some really offensive names.  So, if you really, really offend me, I'll send you one of my autographed pictures of  me and Jay Moore having sex. 
[00:40:00]  And, now, let me tell you something.  Before I explain this, there are some names that just don't offend me, okay?  For example, Bone Smuggler, alright?  I like that name.  It makes me feel like a sexy pirate smuggling bones up my butt across the border.  And Sea Sucker, I mean, that one, that one just makes my mouth water.  You know, I want really, really offensive names.  So, I'm Gay Marco.  This is my alternative lifestyle radio show.  Are we ready to play here?  Then, why don't we all sing the theme song together? 
[00:40:30]  Fag, Twinkie, Faggala, Fairy Boy, Butt Wrangler, the most offensive name game.  Hey, Alan.  Yes.  How are you today, Marco?  We're playing the most offensive name game.  I got one for you.  Okay.  Cole and Cowboy.  Oh.  Oh.  Did I go on?  That's a good one.  I like that one.  I like that one.  Cole and Cowboy.  Actually, it's kind of sexy, though.  I mean, I love cowboys.  Those chaps. 
[00:41:00]  Jimmy?  Yeah.  Hi, Jimmy.  Yeah.  Hey, you're a pillow biter.  Pillow?  No, no.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  When you're getting rammed and you don't want to make too much noise.  No, I mean, I like the pillow.  I like to make a pillow.  Say, hide them douche nozzles for me.  It's been a while.  Okay.  Thomas, you're on the air.  Hi, Marcos.  Hey, Thomas.  I have the name for you.  Okay.  You are a double-dong, dildo-dipping, diesel-dyke, bone-barian, sword-swelling, hog-handling,  ape-trap.  What's that?  Ah! 
[00:41:30]  That's a winner.  We have a winner.  What do I get?  You get an autographed picture of me and Jane Moore having sex.  Oh, I love it.  It's so beautiful.  We'll be getting that right out to you in the mail.  Thank you.  So, Steve, you're on the air.  What is your most offensive name?  Oh, well, I got a name for you.  Okay.  We're waiting.  Okay.  I also got a poem for you.  Okay.  First, the name.  First, the name.  Yeah.  An orifice officer.  Oh, that...  I like that one.  Oh, God.  I love that. 
[00:42:00]  I like that one.  I love anything with police officers.  What's your poem?  Okay.  My poem.  Ready?  Yep.  Ahem.  Okay.  Stay in the closet.  It's safer in there.  Stay in the closet because we don't fight fair.  Stay in the closet for humanity.  Stay in the closet.  Stay away from me, you faggot.  That sucked more than I do.  Nick, you're on the air.  Hey, what's up, Marco?  Hey, Nick.  You have a...  I got a name for you.  Okay.  Ash Nazi. 
[00:42:30]  Not only is that offensive...  That gets the flesh flute, too.  Hey, Rob, you're on the air with Gay Marco.  So, what's your most offensive name?  All right.  I've been told to edit this one out a little bit, but it's C. Dumpster.  Oh, that's a good one.  Kevin, you're on the air.  This is WNEW.  Yeah. 
[00:43:00]  Hi.  All right.  All right.  Oh, you got a sexy voice.  Yeah?  Yeah.  What's your most offensive name?  AIDS courier.  Oh, my.  You get the grand grand prize on that one.  All right.  And we're just about out of time, so we'll just take one more.  We have Nick.  Nick, you're on the air.  Yo, Marco. 
[00:43:30]  Hey, Nick.  I got one that's really offensive, Marco, but it's true.  Okay.  You're a carpet muncher.  I only did it once, and it was out of desperation.  Well, that's all the time we have for my little game.  Hey!  Fag, Twinkie, Faggala, Fairy Boy, Butt Wrangler, the most offensive name game.  Hey!  So, that's all the time we have today.  My show must come to an end here. 
[00:44:00]  You know, it's been a pleasure, and remember, my pleasure is always your pleasure.  So, let me tell you, if you enjoyed my show, let WNEW know, and maybe they'll get me back in the air.  And, hey, you know, if I'm back before Easter, we can hold the Gay Marco Biggest Best Basket Contest.  So, guys, start sending me those crotch shots in your jeans, underwear, sweatpants, and I especially like tight chinos.  So, be sure to read and vote for my weekly column on FounderMusic.com. 
[00:44:30]  And you can also reach me at HeyGayMarco at AOL.com.  Hey!  Here's to Opie and Anthony.  God bless their clean-cut faces and their dirty little minds.  Thank you.  This has been the Gay Marco Show.  I'm so gay, I'm so gay, I'm so, I'm so gay, I'm so gay.  You gave me your love and you showed me the way.  Now that I'm out, I just love being gay.  I used to be tight, but you popped my cherry. 
[00:45:00]  Taking your love feels so good on my knees.  I'm so gay, I'm so gay, I'm so, I'm so gay, I'm so gay.  I was a virgin when you snuck up from behind me.  You grabbed my ass and it felt so great.  I couldn't believe it when you whipped out this big love thing.  This wasn't even our first date.  I'm so gay, I'm so gay, I'm so gay.  There ain't gonna be no more begging me, please. 
[00:45:30]  I know what I want and it's between your knees.  You've got this huge claw, it goes in with such ease.  Taking your love feels so good on my knees.  I'm so gay, I'm so gay, I'm so, I'm so gay, I'm so gay.  And we're back with the Opie and Anthony show.  Hey.  We're back.  We're live again.  You people didn't go away, did you?  I hope not.  I hope not.  It's, what, March 5th, 2002? 
[00:46:00]  Do you remember when we went on at 3 today, remember, and we said we had a meeting to go to?  Remember all that?  Remember?  Do you remember?  Remember?  So it's Tuesday, Anthony.  That was an old bit that we just played, now we're back live in the studio.  Here's how fun this whole thing gets now.  It is so uncomfortable around here today.  Here's how fun it gets.  So, we go on at 3 after 4 hours of taking phone calls behind the scenes with our agent 
[00:46:30]  playing the middleman between us and Ken Stevens.  A lot of people writing on this and feedback that we're acting like 10-year-olds.  We know that.  Yeah.  We know that.  Oh, yeah.  But we have to stoop to their level at this point.  Exactly.  So, we spent 4 hours before the show today discussing if we could come to an agreement  about the type of show we want to do.  The type of show we do, we've been very successful with. 
[00:47:00]  The type of show they hired us to do almost 4 years ago here in New York.  Right.  Right?  Without all those pesky restrictions that have been put on it.  One by one.  Right.  One by one over the past, I don't know, year or so.  Right.  More so than before.  So, we get on the air.  We've been talking on the phone with these inane stupid battles for 4 hours.  We were talking to our boss who's 20 feet away from us in another office through our agent in L.A. 
[00:47:30]  Yeah.  Great.  That's how we do things.  So, we really don't do things like that.  But, no.  All we want to do is do our show the way we've always done it.  That's all.  That includes talking about everything that goes on here at the station, all the people at the station,  everything we feel.  Any little stupid thought that pops in our head, we want to be able to convey it to our listeners  with the only restrictions being that put on us by the FCC.  Right.  That's all.  Maybe talk about the business a little bit. 
[00:48:00]  Right.  Maybe talk about each other in a way that's very uncomfortable for the person.  The person.  It's been fun.  Done it.  So, now, Ken, after this 4 hours of phone tag back and forth, I do have to say, we said  it at 3 o'clock.  I'm quite flattered that we have so much power.  Yes.  I didn't know until yesterday that we had this power to influence our listeners.  We could tell you guys what other radio shows to listen to.  Right.  And you'll do exactly that.  And you'll do it.  I had no idea. 
[00:48:30]  Yes.  I thought I was just stating my opinions about other radio shows in the radio business.  But I'm learning that they take what we say as the gospel, Anthony.  Right.  And if we give them a list of shows that they're allowed to listen to and a list of shows that  they're not allowed to do, they're going to follow this list according to management.  Yeah.  That's what they're scared of in the end.  Don't you think we're a little more concerned about what this show does, what our show does  when we're on the air?  Don't you think that's our primary concern? 
[00:49:00]  We really aren't that concerned with anything else that goes on.  The fact of the matter is, we don't give a crap what other radio shows you listen to.  Right.  But we do give a crap about being able to speak our minds.  Exactly.  So, as we left you, at 3.03 or 3.04, whatever time it was when we were approached by Ken.  3.09.  To have a face-to-face meeting during our show.  He finally decided to come in and face us. 
[00:49:30]  Yeah.  Instead of being 20 feet down the hall, away from us, on the phone with our agent.  Who's in L.A.  Who's in L.A.  Now, the uncomfortable moment happened around 3.08.  Yeah.  No, just before 3 when Ken came into the studio.  I think we have to meet, he says.  We have to meet.  I'm like, well, your timing's a little bad, because it's time to do a radio show now.  Yeah.  But he says, we have to meet.  Why don't you just put on a best of, and we'll have a meeting.  And we've got to sort this out. 
[00:50:00]  So, we're like, what the hell?  There's no way we're going to be able to just get on and do our show, because we didn't even  talk about the show.  Four hours on the phone.  So, we put on a best of that you heard.  Hope you enjoyed the Gay Marco segment.  That was cute.  We thought it was pretty fun.  We were listening in our office as we waited for Ken to come get us.  We go in our office, sit down, assuming Ken's in his office sitting down.  How much more immature and baby-like could this debacle get? 
[00:50:30]  So, we sat in our office for 45 minutes, and he sat in his office for 45 minutes.  Shh, shh.  No, Ken, Ken.  Be quiet.  Shh, Ken.  Ken.  Shh, shh.  It's okay.  Yeah.  So, he sat in his office, and then I guess, who saw him?  Rick.  Rick saw him, and said, well, they're, um...  Are you looking for the guys?  Are you looking for the guys?  They're in their office.  And Ken said to Rick, no, are they looking for me? 
[00:51:00]  Are they looking for me?  So, we're faced with the fact that he didn't want to come to us for the meeting, and we  weren't going to his office for the meeting.  Exactly.  So, we sat there until, I guess, somebody came in and went, well, they're gone.  Ken and Jeremy went to lunch or something.  And we were like, you know something, then?  Screw it.  We're going back on the air to explain this part of the situation.  This is retarded. 
[00:51:30]  Rick, why don't you give him a call on his cell phone and see where he's at?  Give him a little ring.  Ring him up.  Do I have to?  See if there's a possibility that we're going to meet today.  Do we have to now wait for him to eat sushi?  What do I say to him, dude?  Whatever, dude.  We put you in this situation from time to time.  Dial the phone.  What if he has to talk to you? 
[00:52:00]  Then tell him we're on the air.  Okay.  Doing what he pays us to do.  All right.  Now, Rick, do it in here.  Oh, come on.  Do it in here.  Come on.  Dial it on your cell phone and do it in here.  Here, you can use mine.  Here you go.  Beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep.  Mm-hmm.  Mm-hmm.  What the hell? 
[00:52:30]  What are you?  He's going to get to the number.  I'm a very important person.  Look at all the rings.  You have a lot.  Those are all numbers?  Yeah, and a lot of them are going to be deleted after this week.  Go ahead, if you know what I mean.  What?  It's ringing.  Get over there.  Oh, come on.  Rick is now calling up the boss.  Mm-hmm.  Mm-hmm.  Wow, Jim from D.C. 
[00:53:00]  You got that wrong.  Yeah.  Hi, Ken.  This is Rick calling from the O&A show.  Um, the guys wanted me to give you a call, uh, to see if, uh, you'll be meeting with them, I guess, today.  Okay, um.  Where is he?  Um.  Okay.  Um.  Well.  I hear him chappering.  Um, they're on the air right now. 
[00:53:30]  He just lost his lunch.  Yeah, they went back on the air.  He just broke out in a cold sweat.  Um.  Because.  Because.  Looking for Rick.  Right.  But they decided to come back on the air, I guess.  So.  Well, we get paid to be on the air.  Uh.  Yeah, it's our job.  Yeah.  It's our job.  Hold on.  It's my job.  Um.  Do you want to meet with him or not?  No. 
[00:54:00]  Well, where is he?  He's downstairs getting some lunch.  When would he like to meet?  Um.  When would he.  When would you like to meet?  You are the boss.  Huh?  Right now?  Right now.  I hear him yelling.  Is he yelling now?  Yes.  Tell him no yelling.  All right.  Tell him no yelling.  No yelling.  No yelling.  He says he'll do it right now.  He's just coming back up with a sandwich.  No yelling.  Tell him no yelling.  Tell him no yelling, Rick.  Just say you're the messenger. 
[00:54:30]  No yelling.  They're requesting no yelling.  That means them too?  Does that mean you guys?  Hmm.  Oh.  I like cursing, but no yelling.  Cursing, but no yelling.  Soft curses are allowed.  No yelling.  Yeah.  No yelling.  All right.  He said deal.  We'll put a dB meter in there if it goes up too high.  Meeting over.  And no, uh, no pounding of the fist.  Like, none of that.  And Opie wants no pounding of the fist.  And no throwing stuff. 
[00:55:00]  Opie wants no pounding of the fist or throwing stuff.  And what would you like in this meeting?  I'm fine with the low cursing.  I like that.  I use F a lot in these meetings.  All right.  So Opie wants no pounding of the fist and no throwing stuff.  And Anthony's fine with just the low cursing but no yelling.  Can he do that?  Okay.  Yeah, he says he can do that.  All right.  I'm glad that the listeners found out that we're allowed to yell at our boss. 
[00:55:30]  No yelling.  Anything else, dude?  I think that covers it.  That's pretty much it.  Ask him, uh, when, where will be the neutral ground for this meeting?  I don't want it to be in his office.  Where they want to meet, they don't want to do it in your office.  They want to do neutral ground.  Because people could look into his glass, uh, office.  We want drinks.  He says fine with that.  All right.  Can he bring up some dessert? 
[00:56:00]  You're not going to make me do it.  You are terrible.  Where is the meeting?  I missed it.  Where is it?  A neutral location is fine.  Well, where is a neutral location?  I guess maybe one of the, uh, the conference rooms or something.  Too sterile.  That's like his turf.  Conference room?  Conference room.  Ask him, uh, if we could do the meeting at, uh, Privileged Gentleman's Club.  23rd and 11th.  Live on the air.  I think we all need a lap dance at this point.  Opie wants to know if we can go down to Privilege and do the meeting at Privileged Gentleman's Club. 
[00:56:30]  Well, he's laughing.  Well, that's a good sign.  That's going to stop real quick.  What is he saying?  He's not sure of the neutrality of that particular location.  Yeah, that's true.  That's kind of our turf.  All right.  We'll figure it out.  But I don't want it to be in his office.  Did you want me to ask the other question?  Because I don't want to ask it.  Which one?  What's the other question?  Dessert. 
[00:57:00]  Oh.  Um.  He might spit in it at this point, Opie.  I wouldn't take any food from him right now.  Tell him I don't trust him bringing any food back for me.  He'll probably spit in it.  So, Opie says not to worry about bringing any food back for him.  Why?  Because he doesn't trust you.  Why?  Because you might spit in it.  What does he say to that?  Okay.  We want the meeting at Fareed's office at K-Rock. 
[00:57:30]  Tell him that.  No, no, no.  What did he say to the spitting thing?  He said you know him too well.  Oh, see?  He would have spit in it.  Tell him I thought I knew him well.  Opie says he thought he knew you well.  Hmm.  That drew an O.  That hurt.  Yeah, well.  Truth hurts.  So, you want to do that over at that office? 
[00:58:00]  We want to play the Oz music in the background during the meeting.  Ask him if we could tape the meeting and put it on the air.  Oh, that's a good one.  Can we record the meeting so the guys can play it back on the air?  Yes.  We can?  No, he's just repeating the question. 
[00:58:30]  Oh.  Yeah, sure.  He said it depends how it goes.  All right.  So, where are we meeting?  We'll meet upstairs in the conference room.  The conference room?  Yeah.  All right, we need a time.  So, it's not like one person's there waiting for the other.  Upstairs, conference room?  Exactly what time.  Is that good with you, Ken?  What time? 
[00:59:00]  Right now, say about five minutes from now or so?  4.15?  4.15.  Synchronize your watches.  Do you want to go in the sales side door and they'll come in the other door?  So, on the phone, a neutral place.  How about Switzerland?  All right.  So, okay.  4.15 and Ken's coming alone, he says.  Oh.  All right.  Tell him we won't bring Jim Norton in.  All right.  Because then it'll seem like we're going to bring him up.  And tell him if he chooses to fire Ant and I today, please don't fire Jim Norton because 
[00:59:30]  he has a show to sell out here in New York.  All right.  Town Hall, April 18th.  They said.  Ticket available through Ticketmaster.  If you do choose to fire them today, please don't fire Jim Norton until he sells out  his show.  At Town Hall.  Don't fire Jim Norton until he sells out his show at Town Hall.  April 18th.  Right.  Ticket's available through Ticketmaster. 
[01:00:00]  And you can go to eatabullet.com.  He said that's good.  Okay.  He likes Norton.  All right.  I think we're set in.  We done?  Yeah.  Okay.  Right?  I think 4.15, Ken?  We got five minutes.  So we'll see you.  They'll see you in about six minutes upstairs.  All right.  Remember, a sail side door.  They're going to come in the other side.  Yeah.  All right.  All right.  Thank you.  Don't fire me.  Please.  You think if we're gone, you're staying? 
[01:00:30]  Are you insane?  Well, no.  You're probably not going, but he might just fire me for making the call, stupid.  Yeah.  Those days are over.  How uncomfortable is that?  That sock, dude.  Yeah.  That looked pretty bad to be you right there.  Right then and there, huh?  All right.  What tired old bit we're doing next for the fine listeners all over the country?  We're going to do a little...  I like the Nixon and Nam.  We could do Nixon.  How about New Orleans Tom with the bad copy?  All right.  We'll do that.  We got Tom from New Orleans on the way.  Yeah.  And hopefully we'll be back on the air today. 
[01:01:00]  You know something?  Honestly, you just don't know.  We don't know?  I don't know.  Yeah, we shouldn't tease that.  I don't know how this...  You know why?  Because, yeah, that was all funny and stuff, but this goddamn meeting ain't going to be fun.  Believe me.  All right.  Believe me.  You're deleting that number?  No, I'm going to make another call.  We got four minutes to make a call.  Who are you calling?  Who are you calling?  Let me see.  Wait a minute.  I can't see that.  Hold on. 
[01:01:30]  Don't!  All right.  We'll be back.  Our voices will be back.  It just might be old.  Yeah.  Old voices.  You never know.  All right.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  Make it touch her.  Coming soon, the return of the 55-gallon drum challenge on The Opie and Anthony Show.  And E.W. 
[01:02:00]  Here, check it out.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  A couple phone numbers in New York.  877-692-1027.  Anywhere else.  Including...  Everywhere.  How about New Orleans?  It's the home of Annoying Tom.  How you got it doing?  866-2774-WOW.  I guess Tom in New Orleans.  You know this guy?  My bad.  My bad.  He ordered WOW stickers and WOW shirts to give out to our listeners down there in New Orleans. 
[01:02:30]  Oh, this is classic.  Ben, get on the mic real fast.  A little syndication update here for you.  Tom is the guy who drove us nuts when we went down to Mardi Gras.  He's out of his effing mind.  What else can we say?  He takes pictures of his wife pretty much naked and puts them on the website.  I drink B until I pass out.  One day, he forgot to turn the radio station on that we broadcast on. 
[01:03:00]  Oops.  That's where, you know, my bad.  My bad.  Yeah, it's bad.  Well, we got the latest from Tom from New Orleans, Ben.  Okay.  Tom ordered Extreme Radio t-shirts with the new logo of the station down there.  He's like, yeah, so I got the WOW sticker on the back.  The only problem was they put 1027-WNEW on it.  I'm like, so Tom, you know, how many did you order?  He's like, well, I'd rather not talk about that.  Oh, no.  He ordered a ton of shirts with Extreme Radio 94-1 on the front and 1027-8-WNEW. 
[01:03:30]  Like the bumper, the sticker itself, the image of the sticker is on the back.  Exactly.  But it's the sticker from here, from New York.  You know, our WOW logo that everyone seems to like.  But he didn't really look too close, I guess, and just handed it to the print shop,  and they just printed the WOW sticker on the back.  So now the shirts are very confusing.  My bad.  It says 1027-WNEW on the back, and then it has the radio station in New Orleans on the front.  Extreme Radio.  My bad.  My bad.  What a complete horse's ass. 
[01:04:00]  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  And we're depending on him for our success in New Orleans.  And then today he sends copy for a live read for you guys.  Yeah.  And I showed it to you.  He emails it, and he can't even read anything.  He, like, scanned or took a digital picture of the piece of paper.  Yeah.  Instead of just typing it up and emailing it.  Well, typing would take too much time.  So he's still drunk from Mardi Gras.  Yeah, I think he is.  Yeah, he never sobered up.  We've got to get Tom on the phone real fast here.  Tom from New Orleans. 
[01:04:30]  What's up, bro?  How are you guys doing?  I'm doing great, Tom.  My bad.  We heard about your latest F-up.  Well, I mean, as long as they didn't screw the stickers up, the shirts can be fixed.  The sticker thing gets screwed up.  There was a problem with the order.  We had a little problem with the order.  Problem with the order.  The stickers are fine.  The stickers will be fine.  My bad.  Let's just hope.  So what happened with the shirts there, Tom?  Well, it wasn't my fault.  I did all, everything on my end was done correctly. 
[01:05:00]  We had a promotion girl.  From your pattern of speech, I totally believe you.  One foot out the door and one foot in.  And I mean, you know, I gave her the sticker.  I told her to just change the top to extreme.  And somehow that didn't get done.  So let's just keep our fingers crossed that it got done for the sticker.  Well, we got an idea.  We want to cross out the back of the shirt and then write at the bottom, my bad.  That's perfect.  So should we keep all those and it'll be a collector's item?  Yeah, yeah, just make an X through the sticker and write, my bad.  You know, Tom reminds me of, so the finished Stonehenge monument's going to follow these 
[01:05:30]  exact contours when we get the actual piece.  No, this is the piece.  This is the size.  Have you ever been to Stonehenge?  The triptych stand, three people against it.  Well, that's what you drew on the napkin.  F the napkin.  I wanted a full-size goddamn reproduction of a Stonehenge monument.  My bad.  Over here.  Did you get that copy?  I do declare. 
[01:06:00]  How was that?  Is that some great copy?  The copy, we can't read it because it looked like it was just scammed.  But I faxed one to Ben.  He ought to have it on his freaking fax machine.  But, you know, when you're writing crayon, it doesn't fax well.  Why don't you go down to the general store and have Sarah type it up?  So you call the president a murderer?  New Orleans boob.  Norton, you are an imbecile.  You really are, Norton. 
[01:06:30]  I thought we bonded when you were down here.  I'm going to lift your head, man.  Oh, that was awful.  I thought we bonded.  Hey, Todd.  And now you turn on me like that?  I don't like it, Todd.  What's the copy about?  Premier Mitsubishi, man.  It's about these guys Bishop and Owensby.  They'll finance anybody in two minutes.  Oh, yeah?  Yeah.  Well, why don't you send us some copy?  We can read.  Copy.  Copy.  What the hell is that?  You guys get to work.  What is that in the background? 
[01:07:00]  That's the sales desk.  You should untie them.  Tom, we're off the air today.  No, we're not.  There's no problem with the boa.  So you got, I'm going to go down and get me a sarsaparilla and whittle me a spell.  I could, whoo, his show is hot.  I could use a mint mulep.  It's called a hurricane, boy.  It's still my heart.  It's called a hurricane.  I feel like a crawfish in the anus of a boa on a Wednesday afternoon in the hot July sun in New Orleans. 
[01:07:30]  Hey, man.  That's how we say it down here.  Come down here and see if you can survive a week of partying down here, buddy.  Tom, they're going to tap this on your head and say cock-a-doodle-doo.  And good day to you, sir.  No, no.  Isn't some grade school, all-girl grade school getting let out right now?  Can't you go do something?  I get it.  Hey, Tom, you got people coming into your office and just saying my bad to your face over and over again now?  All day long, dude.  My bad.  My bad.  All day long.  Either my bad or how you guys doing? 
[01:08:00]  How you guys doing?  There it is.  How you guys doing?  With a couple of cold ones.  We got them all, Rob.  I know.  My bad.  My bad.  All right, Tom.  I know.  All right, guys.  And hey, man, to that imbecile that wrote that letter out in California, you'd think they'd get it out there, man.  Tell them to turn the radio off.  I got a four-year-old and a two-year-old.  But they're both boys.  Yeah, they're frying seven-year-old girls and leaving them on the side of the road.  Just a four-year-old, not the two-year-old yet, man.  And you got a hot wife with big boobs that you like to show off on the Internet. 
[01:08:30]  That's right, baby.  It's hot, dude.  You like that?  Yeah, really hot.  Very sexy.  All right, dude.  Call Bishop and Owensby, Premier Mitsubishi.  Right.  All right.  And if you guys can do my copy, I'd love you.  If you can't do it, well, I guess it's your bet.  We'll get to it.  We love you.  All right.  You're hot down here, man.  All right.  Extreme 94.9.  Let's just keep the radio on, okay?  The radio is on, man.  No more problems.  No more problems.  You don't like problems.  Look at your call letters and remember them.  Yeah.  I do.  We have learned when the station is on, people listen to it. 
[01:09:00]  Big time.  Fundamentally, people are suckers for the right call letters.  Big time.  And the truth is on your side.  You know that switch that says on-off?  Tape it in the on.  All right.  Hey, remember, this is Louisiana, Chief.  I mean, how do you know who your daddy is?  Because your mama told you so.  Ah, yes.  Michael Rooker.  I cannot work with Bill Broussard anymore.  Are you putting an ultimatum to me, Tom?  Yes.  All right, Tom. 
[01:09:30]  All right, fellas.  All right.  Y'all behave.  You got great numbers coming out here.  Y'all behave, too, there, Tom.  All right.  I'm going to go grab a couple of colds.  Yes, sir.  Has your mama told you?  Has your mama told you?  Pete wants to defend New Orleans now.  Pete, what's up?  How y'all doing?  Hey, what up?  What up, bro?  I think Tom is the biggest idiot in the world.  And you know how many times the station has screwed up since the last time?  There was one day last week where we couldn't hear y'all at all. 
[01:10:00]  What was on the air instead of us?  They put music on for like 45 minutes.  Man, y'all are awesome.  But you know what?  He doesn't even advertise y'all.  It's like people like us that work out in the construction telling everybody else, hey,  why don't y'all listen to these guys in the afternoons?  Y'all like the best thing in the afternoon.  Usually we get so pissed off, but he's such a character, you just got to laugh.  Dude, he's the biggest fag.  And that's not his wife.  That's a prostitute.  He pays off his sidekick.  No, that is his wife. 
[01:10:30]  That ain't his wife.  You know what he needs?  He needs Ed Asner to pistol up him.  Dude, y'all rules written.  You're awesome.  You need to come down here and tell everybody about it.  Extreme radio and smithereens.  All right, Pete.  I love y'all.  Take care.  Yeah, I love y'all.  There was a problem with the board.  I got music in.  It was supposed to be y'all's show.  But I hit the wrong button on what they called the board.  All right.  We got Tom from New Orleans back on the phone. 
[01:11:00]  And you know what?  Tommy.  Hey, we had to call Tom back because we finally got the commercial copy.  My bad.  My bad.  Do I have a copy of that?  No.  Tom, I got beer on my seersucker suit.  Copy that.  Tell me how to get that stain of beer out of my seersucker suit.  We need that immediately.  You know what?  There's some problems with the copy.  Tom.  What?  There's problems with the copy.  I figured that was. 
[01:11:30]  I figured.  I figured.  Well, we're going to read it on the air so they're going to get a free commercial.  Okay.  And, well, there's problems with it.  Okay.  Yeah.  But now we need the copy, though, because I want to read it as it is.  But we can fix it.  We have an Emmy award-winning writer in the studio.  Yes.  Yeah.  Paul will help.  Paul's going to write your copy today.  My Emma.  All right.  Emma.  I got an Emma.  My Emma award.  All right.  Sweetie have it.  All right.  I'm one.  That is a fun award. 
[01:12:00]  I'm one.  And Anthony's two.  It'll be, yeah.  It'll be very obvious what the problem is here.  Let's see how quick everybody can figure out what the problem is with the copy.  Okay?  I say it's with an interesting line.  I didn't write, Tim.  Well, don't you.  You're in charge.  Don't you.  I love the lack of any responsibility Tom has for anything that goes on it.  Well, he had one of two choices.  If he spent time proofreading, the board would go dead again.  And the entire station would get...  I'm monitoring the boas. 
[01:12:30]  All right, Tom.  Here's our read.  Here we go.  Let's read this.  Hey, Anthony.  Where'd you get the new car?  I got it at Premier Mitsubishi, Opie.  Tom, have you figured out the problem yet?  When will Anthony's car be arriving in New York City?  When am I getting my Mitsubishi, my Premier Mitsubishi?  I'm going to call the guy tomorrow.  Make sure it's coming.  And then, Opie, read the next line because now I'm getting bashed. 
[01:13:00]  Let's start from the beginning.  This is not a knock against Mitsubishi.  If they want to give Anthony a free car, I'm sure he'll drive it.  Well, I think off the bat, Anthony's not committing to that first line.  What's your motivation?  Okay, Opie, now read the line.  Go all the way down to the bottom of that first one.  Well, I want to start over.  Here we go.  Because I think I can do it better.  Okay.  Hey, Anthony.  Where'd you get the new car?  I got it at Premier Mitsubishi, Opie.  Yeah, I've seen your credit.  Who co-signed for you?  Okay, Tom.  Tom?  Tom, I can see the problem there. 
[01:13:30]  What am I now?  I'm an old poor boy.  I can't follow the new car.  I have bad credit.  All of a sudden, I got, like, lousy credit.  I'm a scofflaw.  Well, Opie, I've been running from the law for robbery.  I'm syndicated in 33 markets, and I can't get a credit card.  I need a co-signer.  And by the way, it says, hey, where you get the new car.  Who wrote this?  What southern idiot wrote, where you get the new car? 
[01:14:00]  Hey, Anthony.  Where do you get the new car?  You know, I was helping his writing, but yeah, it makes even better.  Where do you get new car?  All right, we'll start again.  Let's see if there's any other problem.  Okay.  Hey, Anthony.  Where do you get the new car?  I got it at Premier.  I got it at Premier Mitsubishi, Opie.  Yeah, I've seen your credit, man.  Who co-signed for you?  Man, I went and saw the Bishop and Owensby.  They get everybody approved, and most don't need a co-signer, man. 
[01:14:30]  Well, what if you don't have any credit, or you have bad credit, man?  Bishop and Owensby, Premier Mitsubishi can handle any credit, good or bad.  It's like a Japanese guy from the 60s wrote this.  And have you handled in less than 10 minutes.  Premier Mitsubishi.  Mitsubishi.  Yeah, it's like that little hip familiar.  Get the lingo, man.  Premier Mitsubishi can handle.  Well, this stinks. 
[01:15:00]  You really should be sterilized for this.  Wow.  Yeah.  I already am.  You know what it is, Tom?  What?  We've never been good with the pre-written Opie Anthony back-and-forth banter scripts.  Gotcha.  Never, ever good.  Always comes off sounding bad.  I like the note.  Ben, tell O&A they can definitely go off the coffee.  Boy, I did.  That was me.  Yeah, I know.  It's important that you gave them that permission. 
[01:15:30]  They just want to get the point across.  That anyone can get financed in two minutes.  In two minutes.  Hey, I'll go off the coffee.  Okay.  Hey, Anthony, screw your great new car.  I need some Coke.  Where's Tom?  He's making show of the station still on the air.  I know you can drink in the airport.  He's drinking in the airport.  Tom, maybe you should feed your radio station some Coke and it'll stay on all night long. 
[01:16:00]  I might have to come.  It might come to that one day, you know.  You could drive away in a brand new Mitsubishi in one hand, the steering wheel, and the other, a brimming ice-cold hurricane.  A hand grenade.  A hand grenade as you leave the showroom floor in your new Mitsubishi.  You could be doing 90 miles an hour with a drink in each hand.  Drive with your knees as you go through the Crawfish drive-thru.  Crawfish Monica.  Oh, God.  Well, Tom, how about a rewrite, and we'll see what you've got for us. 
[01:16:30]  All right.  I'll take care of this personally.  Rewrite it so that there are no words on the page.  Okay.  All you just kind of want to know is the name of the place, the car they sell, and the phone number.  Are you more drunk from the last time we talked to you?  Like, 20 minutes later, you sound more hammered.  How about, hey, Anthony, my neck hurts.  I have cancer.  I've had it for years.  Really?  I just want to be a priest, live in a monastery, serve God, and they defrocked me. 
[01:17:00]  How do you know every line in a movie?  I know.  How many times did you see JFK?  It does 40.  40 times.  It's how it went to New Orleans.  It's so good.  Very good.  It's such a great movie.  You saw that movie that time?  It's a guy's film.  You find me one chick that can sit through that.  They're like, no action, dummies.  Not one girl I've ever effed can get through JFK without saying something stupid or broad-like.  Hold on.  We're throwing a girl in a dumpster soon.  Calm down.  I'm going to read it for you, though.  All right.  All right.  I'm making a stop. 
[01:17:30]  I'm making my nightly stop on the way home.  Thank you.  Much obliged to you, Tom.  Much obliged.  Getting a cold one.  You know what I mean?  He's really stopping for beer right now.  Right now.  This is the guy that he's betting on.  Enjoy the keg.  Do you want to talk to the cashier?  Yeah, let's talk to the cashier.  Okay.  Tom, you know the rules.  Tell them they're on the air.  Okay, I will.  I know the rules.  How you doing?  How you doing?  How you doing?  Talk to your head?  I'll need to get her this one beer. 
[01:18:00]  She's going, you're the idiot that wrote that copy for Premier Mitsubishi?  Get out of my skull.  Put her on the radio.  How you doing?  Tom.  Hey.  Tom, put her on the phone.  All right.  Here.  Let's see.  Opie and Anthony, we do a radio show down here.  Wait.  I just want to ask you something.  I'm actually there from New York.  Can I get my bag?  I'm sorry.  I'm about to drop you now.  She's going to slap you upside your head.  Wait.  What's her problem there, Tom?  Hello.  How are you doing?  How are you doing?  I'm fine.  What's your name? 
[01:18:30]  Jamil.  Jamil.  What did Tom over there just buy?  Right now?  Yeah.  It's 545.  No, no, no.  No one said what time it is, stupid.  What did Tom just buy?  Listen.  Listen.  What did he just buy?  A beer.  How much beer?  24.  Miller Lite.  Miller Lite?  34 ounce?  24 ounce. 
[01:19:00]  Oh, 24 pack?  Yeah.  No, 24 ounce Miller Lite.  Did you float over on a raft?  What are you talking about?  I want to see your green card.  All right.  Like everybody in line gets really pissed off at me.  I bet.  Well, they've got to get their Funyuns and beer.  They've got to get home.  Wheel of Fortune is about to come on.  They have a life.  What are they worried about?  Hey, Tom, put a gal on the phone.  Let's say hi to a gal.  You want to, too?  Yeah. 
[01:19:30]  Tell them on the air, though.  How about a Southern Bear?  Let me get back up.  We're going to get a Southern Bear.  A nice Southern Belle on the air.  Oh.  I don't know how nice they are.  I do declare your poop chute is the most pretty.  We're kind of in a bad neighborhood.  You know what I'm saying?  Yeah.  I do declare Tom is some kind of a man.  Man, that's it.  You're not getting the Southern Belle here, boys.  Believe me.  She might be getting Queen Latifah's angry young sister, but she's coming out. 
[01:20:00]  As soon as she's done military pressing, have her come to the phone.  Wait, he's waiting for the lady to kill her.  A fake jacket on with some baggy jeans.  Yeah.  He's waiting outside.  And hold on.  I'm waiting outside.  All right.  All right.  Hey, how are you doing, man?  How are you doing?  This is Opie and Anthony from New York to do a radio show.  I just wanted to talk to you on the air.  They're syndicated in like 50 markets.  Oh, okay.  Big numbers.  Hold on.  Okay.  Opie and Anthony.  Hello.  How are you doing, baby?  Okay.  How are you doing?  What's your name?  My name is Kathy. 
[01:20:30]  Kathy.  Yes, sir.  Kathy, Tom was supposed to pick the ugliest woman in that parking lot.  Are you the ugliest woman in that parking lot?  Oh, that's what he's probably been doing?  Yes.  Oh, Tom.  Oh, why would you do that to me?  You just told me you'd pick the ugliest woman in that parking lot.  No, they didn't.  Oh, why would you do that?  Oh, man.  No, I'm not the ugliest woman.  She threw the phone down. 
[01:21:00]  Effin' brilliant.  That's great.  Norton, give that Emmy to Norton right now.  Yeah, there you go.  That's great.  Holy Jesus Christ.  We're all funniest goddamn thing.  We're all trying to flip it.  You nailed it.  You nailed it.  Holy.  That was too goddamn funny.  I need to hear that again.  Immediately.  Immediately.  We're running out of time on the show.  Oh, you don't do that.  Oh, Tom.  Tom. 
[01:21:30]  They told me you were supposed to pick the ugliest woman.  Oh, my God.  Oh, God.  Tom.  Hey.  Hey, what happened, man?  I think you might see.  How you doing, man?  She threw the phone at me.  Goddamn, that was funny.  What did she do to you?  She said, you told her I was the oldest woman in the parking lot, Tom?  And then she said something else to you.  And then the other girl that was in line, the other lady, I should say, that was bitching 
[01:22:00]  about me hitting her Funyuns.  She hollered at me.  She was hollering at me.  Come on.  Leave me alone.  And then she threw the phone at me and left.  Tom.  You hung me out to dry there.  You know, you hung me out to dry there.  I need a drink.  God, he never disappoints.  We're going to have to wait through the phone at me.  All right.  Let's take a break.  We'll be back.  So remember, guns don't kill people.  Dangerous minorities do. 
[01:22:30]  The Opiate Anthony Show.  It just doesn't get any worse than this.  The Hickford Zebra of finishing after Zeppelin plays.  Pretty much what you're going to be getting.  Hey, Anthony, Richard Nixon is in the news.  Yes.  I won't talk about it.  Cut to it.  Well, the tapes were released. 
[01:23:00]  Yeah, they're playing them all over CNN.  From 1972.  Everyone remembers the Nixon tapes from Watergate.  That eight-minute gap and all the controversy of that.  And it turned out, it came out that Nixon had taped like every minute of him in the White House.  He had secret microphones.  This guy was one of the most paranoid, scared of communism, anti-Semite.  He was a racist, a very bigoted man. 
[01:23:30]  And he was, quite frankly, the most insane president we ever had.  And Ben Stein wrote for him.  Ben Stein.  Ben Stein.  His father and himself, Ben Stein's father and Ben Stein, were speechwriters for Dick Nixon.  And Dick Nixon was one of the biggest anti-Semites ever.  Yet, Ben Stein got pissed at us because he thought I made a Jewish slur once.  A little bit of hypocrisy there.  I bet if we cut Ben a check, he wouldn't have gotten as upset. 
[01:24:00]  But for some reason, he could hang around while Tricky Dick was like, Ben, I need a speech.  I need a speech about how the peace talks are going in them.  Write something.  Write something clever.  I know you Jews can be clever and crafty.  Write something that covers up the truth.  You Jews are good liars.  A bunch of tapes came out. 
[01:24:30]  And it's everything from him defending women being groped, to faking of napalm photos, to the kicker.  Man, I love this one.  Nixon was fixing to nuke Vietnam.  Groovy.  Groovy.  Let me smoke a joint, then we'll drop the big one.  And what did Kissinger say?  I don't think that's a good idea.  Maybe we... 
[01:25:00]  Shut up, you Jaime.  I'm the president.  President anti-Semi.  Yeah.  In 72.  Smoke up, Hank.  Smoke up and forget about everything.  But I...  Oh, that was harsh.  When I smoke up, Henry, until you talk, I almost forget you're a dirty heave. 
[01:25:30]  So in 72, Kissinger and everyone else laid out his options for stepping up the war in Vietnam.  Kissinger had these proposals, like attacking power plants and docks and whatnot.  Here's what Nixon says.  He goes, I'd rather use the nuclear bomb.  I mean, did this guy understand if we had dropped a bomb on Vietnam, China and the Soviet Union would have reamed us a new ass? 
[01:26:00]  And then right when he said, I'd rather use the nuclear bomb, Henry Kissinger goes, that I think would just be too much.  Jesus, of course.  And then Nixon goes, the nuclear bomb.  Does that bother you?  I just want you to think big.  Think big like your Jew knows. 
[01:26:30]  And then he didn't drop the bomb, obviously, but he ordered the biggest escalation of the war since 68.  He later added that, I want to decimate that goddamn place.  North Vietnam is going to get reordered.  It's about time. 
[01:27:00]  It's what should have been done a long time ago.  Boy, in hindsight, the guy was absolutely right.  They should have nuked him.  Ben, Ben, get your Jew dead, Ben, and write me a speech.  Write me something that'll get me out of trouble for nuking the little yellow slopes.  Take this down, Ben.  Dear gooks, I apologize for the crater that was previously your nation. 
[01:27:30]  We will do everything to fill it with Coca-Cola factories and McDonald's.  Signed, et cetera, et cetera, blah, blah.  Fill in the blanks, Jaime.  Nuk it.  And then, at one point, Nixon gets pissed at Kissinger because Kissinger's too concerned about civilian casualties.  He goes, I don't give a damn.  I just don't care. 
[01:28:00]  They're not even human.  You ever see them with their slanty little eyes?  Slopped heads.  The guy was certifiably insane, and he was running the goddamn country.  Then there's this little transfer that they got on tape.  72 again.  There was some problem with Nixon's ambassador to France getting roaring drunk and groping flight attendants on a trip home from Paris. 
[01:28:30]  Now, nowadays, this guy would have been gone in a second.  It would have been a huge scandal story.  But they asked the president about it after a Jack Anderson column regaled Redis with graphic accounts of the ambassador's behavior on the flight to Washington.  And you know what Nixon's answer was?  Look, people get drunk.  And he's feeling off the flight attendant.  People chase girls.  At the point, it is, it's a hell of a lot better for them to get drunk than to take drugs. 
[01:29:00]  And it's better to chase girls than boys.  That's what he said.  I don't like the homos.  At least he's not grabbing my f***.  So you get a little boozed up and grab a f*** or two.  I've been known to reach over and grab a flight attendant's f*** every so often.  Oh, my God!  It keeps them on their toes.  Get me a drink or I'll put my thumb in your f*** hole. 
[01:29:30]  I'm the president.  Hey, Nixon, you're stealing Brokaw's bed.  F*** Brokaw.  Another liberal communist.  I'll bury a digit in your f***.  Bobby Bigrigger.  Yeah, I wanted to ask Tricky Dick there.  How do you go about nuking the women and children?  Easy.  You just don't lead them as much. 
[01:30:00]  Oh, okay.  Got it.  Thanks, guys.  If they run, they're VC.  If they stand still, they're well-disciplined, Vincent.  Nuke the whole country.  That's his stand-on to the groping.  Then, this is great.  Who can forget the picture of the young, naked Vietnamese girl running down the street after her village, Trang Bang? 
[01:30:30]  I believe her name was Kim Fook.  Kim Fook.  Kim Fook.  F.  No.  P.  H.  UC.  UC is her name.  Kim Fook.  She's a gook.  Her name is Fook.  Fook the gook.  Fook them all, I say.  She's running out of Trang Bang Village.  Turns out, oops. 
[01:31:00]  You know, we dropped a napalm and it hit a village.  Now, people don't seem as concerned when we have that.  It's called collateral damage, right?  What's that happen?  We were napalming a village.  And one went awry and napalmed a little innocent village.  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  That's not very funny. 
[01:31:30]  Well, everyone was horrified.  It was pretty much one of the turning points of the war.  Here's Nixon.  I wonder if that picture was fixed.  He thinks...  Oh, my God.  He thinks it was a doctored propaganda photo.  Come on.  It looks like a glamour shot at the mall.  He talked to his chief of staff.  H.R.  Haldeman about that.  And Haldeman said, could have been. 
[01:32:00]  I want to consult H.R. on this.  H.R.  Haldeman's a...  No, H.R.  Puffin' Stuff.  H.R.  Puffin' Stuff.  He's your friend when things get rough.  H.R.  Puffin' Stuff.  You can't do a little, but you can't do enough.  Get me H.R.  Puffin' Stuff on the phone.  Once upon a summertime, just a dream from destiny.  Ben, write me a speech on how I'm appointing H.R.  Puffin' Stuff as chief of staff.  Come and play.  No, it's H.R.  Haldeman, sir.  And I want Puffin' Stuff.  I want the Navy put in charge of the tug of Sigmund the Sea Monster. 
[01:32:30]  Get me Jimmy's magic flute.  We'll nuke them all.  Do you belong to a cookie or witch who had in mind the place?  Oh, the witch, yes.  We can fly her over North Vietnam.  Bomb them into the stoney.  Do you want a beautiful boat for Scotland?  I'm having a acid flashback of this music.  I love this song.  What if we strap a nuke to witchy poof?  Then fly a ride into North Vietnam. 
[01:33:00]  Hanoi will pay.  Witch's boat attack and as the boy was hiding.  Oh, God.  I love that song.  So just hours of fun, tricky, dicky tapes.  Write me a speech.  Hey, Jaime.  She was a hot, naked little fook.  Look at that little fook run.  Hey, H.R., look.  She's running like her ass is on fire. 
[01:33:30]  Oh, it is.  I think it's fixed.  There must be some kind of way out of here.  I think it's that Lucasfilm industrial eye to match.  What?  Four more years?  There's too much confusion.  They faked that little fook.  That's a pretty big hit for a Jew, Henry. 
[01:34:00]  Don't bogart the bomb.  Leave it to a Jaime like you to take all my tots.  I got this herb.  It's great.  I got it from Elvis.  He's a drug addict.  And I put him in charge of the DEA.  Bring in that faggot Haldeman.  I keep it in my snatch pad.  It's a great idea.  It's going to take off someday. 
[01:34:30]  Trust me.  Take some E.  Look, I got a glove stick in my mouth, Henry.  Dance with me.  Dance with me.  You're crazy.  And you're a kite.  I am an anti-Semite.  You won't have dick nicks and a kick around anymore.  I'm raving, Henry.  I'm raving.  Bring some of your Jew bitches.  I hear they suck a mean one.  Till you marry them.  Ho, ho.  Waddle doodle. 
[01:35:00]  Oh, wow.  Bravo.  There you go.  I can't wait to hear all the tape.  We would play them, honestly.  But they are of such bad quality.  They're playing them on some of the news things.  CNN.  You can't even hear them.  I can't understand anything.  There's subtitles so you can read it.  I mean, the tape is from 72.  It may be kept in his drawer.  I slept with it under my pillow because the crafty Jews might have stolen it.  I think the translator is just making up things.  Yeah, he could.  I think he's saying, uh, nuke Vietnam here. 
[01:35:30]  Half of it says, um, says inaudible.  Inaudible.  And then I banged Kelly LeBarbrock with Leif Gareth.  It was the 70s.  It was a different time.  Now I have a 13-year-old daughter.  I turn it off.  Were you sitting at the beach with your pals waiting for the F word?  Waiting for the F word during the Rolling Stones.  Me and Henry and Ben Stein and his father.  I said, hey, what's he saying, Jew? 
[01:36:00]  I'm crazy.  Bang, bang, bang, bang.  Bang, bang.  I'm Tricky Dick and I'm crazy.  It's Friday.  Bang, bang, bang.  Come here, checkers.  Get crazy with me, checkers.  Bang, bang.  Come on, Henry.  Come on, Henry.  Beat the drum with your nose, Jew.  Bang, bang, bang.  Bang, bang.  I want to nuke the gooks all day.  I don't want to work. 
[01:36:30]  This is a lying naked book.  That book is a lying gook.  Bang, bang, bang.  Nuke the gook.  Come on, dance with me, Henry.  Give me some more pot.  We're raving.  I don't want to work.  Come on.  Where's G. Gordon Liddy?  Liddy, get me some acid.  I know you can do it. 
[01:37:00]  You effed up the whole water game thing for me, Liddy.  Justin, what's up?  Hey, I want to bang, bang, bang, bang.  Go crazy with me, Justin.  Are you a Jew?  Bang, bang, bang.  Bang, bang, bang.  Bang, bang, bang.  Bang, bang.  Off the Ho Chi Minh Trail.  Fook, Fook the gook.  Fook is a lying naked gook.  Kelly, what's going on? 
[01:37:30]  Hi, how's it?  How you doing?  All right.  Can we sing it?  Shut up, bitch.  I'm going to eat your lunch.  Go ahead, Justin.  Where am I, niggas?  Go ahead, Kelly.  Okay, ready?  Yeah.  Everyone knows bitches can't think.  Bobby or Bobber, what's up?  Hey, I wanted to know if Mr. President would favor us with his real-sex old man moan.  Oh.  Oh, God.  The only thing that could be worse is Kissinger's.  I'm raving.  Hey, can we play what's in gook, fook, pants? 
[01:38:00]  What for?  I win.  Hey, when did you burn that off this morning?  Hey, it's not like I was flying the place.  Calm down, Richard.  If we nuke the whole place.  All right.  There you are.  Dick Nixon's tapes released.  Have fun with them.  All right.  All right. 
[01:38:30]  The Opie and Anthony F. U. Line.  It's there for you when life sucks.  Sucks to be me.  Call anytime.  212-830-3785.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  We've got to get Earl in here because there's something that we can talk about with Earl that a lot of people can relate to.  Oh, my God.  Classic Earl.  Hi, Earl.  It's clever Earl.  How you doing, Earl?  Club Earl.  Club Earl.  Hey, fool. 
[01:39:00]  Hey, woman.  Hey, woman.  Why don't you come home with a real man?  I see you survived your ski day.  Yes, I did.  Yeah.  And then you went to Nadine's going away party last night.  How was that?  For a few minutes.  Anything happen at the going away party that you want to share with anyone?  Earl, comment.  Anything?  Comment.  Anything?  Anything?  Anything happen?  Anything?  I can remember.  Nothing you can remember.  Were you drinking, Earl?  No. 
[01:39:30]  No?  Yes.  Were you talking to Nadine, giving her your best wishes?  For her future.  Of course.  Going away party.  Yeah.  Why not?  Sure.  Wish her luck at the hospital where she's going to work?  Yes.  Yeah.  Mm-hmm.  And that was about it?  Mm-hmm.  Mm-hmm.  Had a drink?  Mm-hmm.  No, you don't even drink.  Anything?  Had like a ginger ale, maybe?  And then...  Oh, with a cherry.  I didn't even have that.  I had water.  Oh, water.  Water.  Good, good, good.  Anything happen that may be thought of as uncomfortable?  Anything?  Anything, Earl?  Anything? 
[01:40:00]  Comment?  Comment?  No.  I have no idea what you're talking about.  No?  No.  Anything awkward or strange or maybe uncomfortable?  Nothing?  Nothing?  Comment, Earl?  Anything?  No?  Did you ask her anything?  Anything?  Any questions?  Earl?  Question?  Comment?  Answer?  Earl?  Did you ask her anything?  Anything?  Anything?  Anything?  What'd you ask, Earl?  Um, did you ask...  Whoa, whoa!  Uh-oh, I think, I think...  Ladies and gentlemen, let the record state, I did not do that one either.  Earl just threw something at Ben for laughing. 
[01:40:30]  Earl, anything?  Why are you getting mad at Ben?  Why did you throw something at Ben?  I was just laughing.  He was in the way.  Wait, you were throwing at me?  No.  Mm-hmm.  This is the wrong day, my friend.  Earl?  Any other day, it would be a lot of fun.  Earl, anything?  Was asked.  I wasn't even mad at that one.  Well, obviously, that got a reaction, because you're throwing stuff at Ben as he giggles.  No, because he's just sitting there cackling like a goddamn chicken.  Why do you get so pissed off when Ben cackles? 
[01:41:00]  Why?  He's enjoying himself and having good, clean fun.  Yeah.  Ben's enjoying the show.  Just a white man laughing.  Right.  What do you think, Earl?  What's wrong with you?  What's wrong?  Do you have a problem with Ben when he cackles?  Can I go now?  No, no, no.  We need you.  We need you here.  I don't know.  That's why I'm going to ask you.  All right.  All right.  I'll give you a couple more little hints.  Lock the door.  Anything you can remember asking Nadine? 
[01:41:30]  Yeah.  Ask her any questions.  Did you ask her anything last night?  Nadine.  Nadine.  Earl, comment.  Beautiful Nadine.  Anything.  She's pretty.  Beautiful Egyptian goddess Nadine.  Anything, Earl?  Now that she doesn't work here anymore, I think we can say, without getting a sexual harassment  suit, a fine piece of ass, Earl.  She's cute.  Anything?  What do you think?  Did you ask her a question?  Did you ask her a question if she could do something for you? 
[01:42:00]  Yeah.  Anything, Earl?  Comment, please.  Well, I always, knowing that, what the reaction will get from her, I always say, I always use  the OP question where that, when she goes, can we see your stuff?  Oh, you asked her that?  What?  That isn't what we're talking about, but you asked her to see.  But I always, but I know what type of reaction I'll get from her, that's why I asked her. 
[01:42:30]  I have no idea.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  He's lost his mind.  Oh, my God.  Earl has lost his mind.  Wait a minute.  Earl, get back.  Hold on, Earl.  Holy Jesus.  Jesus Christ, Earl.  What's wrong?  What's wrong?  Holy Jesus, Earl lost his mind.  He wanted to kill Ben.  What's wrong?  Ben's laughing too hard.  He's having much too good a time. 
[01:43:00]  Okay, Earl.  So, you asked to see her stuff.  I have no idea where this is going.  Did you ask Nadine to maybe attend something with you?  What?  What?  We're going to Eddie Trunk's wedding.  Ah!  Here's the rub.  Eddie Trunk that does a couple of rock and roll shows here at WNAW.  Yes.  Very good ones.  Oh, yeah.  Very good job.  They rock.  And he's getting married.  And you need a date.  So, you, uh...  Did she need a date?  She wanted to go.  I didn't have a ride. 
[01:43:30]  So, I asked her.  So, you figure you'd ask the lovely Nadine to go with you.  Nothing's going on.  Earl, did you ask Nadine to go to Eddie Trunk's wedding?  Yes.  You did.  That's a date.  A wedding...  So, to go to a wedding with somebody is kind of like a night out together, which is a date.  So, I was just...  Oh, but there's more to it.  I know there's more to it.  And this is the most funnest part of this whole story.  No, she said...  She said... 
[01:44:00]  You asked her.  Hold it.  You walked up.  I did not ask her.  How did you ask her to go to the wedding with you?  Give me your line.  What was it?  She knows Eddie.  I know Eddie.  Right.  We both...  I said, do you want to go to the wedding?  You want to go to the wedding.  You got invited to Eddie Trunk's wedding.  Yes.  Right?  Nadine did not.  As far as I know, she did not.  So, you went up to Nadine and said, Nadine, would you go to the wedding with me?  Eddie Trunk's wedding with me.  Yes.  And there was a but at the time.  And what...  No, what...  A but on whose part? 
[01:44:30]  Yours or hers?  Or hers.  No, I know.  That's what we're getting to.  But at first, you walked up to Nadine, pretty Nadine, and said, would you go to Eddie Trunk's wedding  with me?  There was nothing into this.  It was provided that...  Earl, I ain't even going to go there.  I ain't even going to go there.  You're right.  But you went up to her like anyone would go up to anyone and ask to go to a wedding.  What was her answer?  She said she can go, provided that she can bring her boyfriend with her.  What's so funny about that? 
[01:45:00]  There's nothing going on.  You got sick.  Shut down.  No.  Dude, there's nothing to shoot down.  When you go up to a girl and ask her to go to someone's wedding, that's like asking someone  on a date.  And then, okay, I'll tell my boyfriend.  Let's say you're in high school and you want to ask someone to the prom.  They never shoot back an answer to you like, well, yeah, but can I bring my boyfriend?  Oh, my God.  Put that down, Earl.  Oh, no.  Shut down. 
[01:45:30]  Oh, no.  Here is what happened in essence, Earl.  If you really think about it.  We are not going to think about it.  No, no.  Do we have witnesses in that?  She has to bring her boyfriend.  Right.  What anointment.  Doesn't it?  Oh, no, Eddie.  We're free with Eddie, Earl.  Why does she have to bring her boyfriend?  I had no problem with it.  Yes, you had no problem, but here's what happened.  You, in essence, sent Nadine an invitation to Eddie's wedding plus one.  You gave her an invitation to the wedding. 
[01:46:00]  He's not even going.  Who's not going?  Nadine's boyfriend is not even going.  Why is that?  First of all, Eddie.  Earl, is it true that you also called Eddie and said that I'm bringing two dates?  I didn't say bringing two dates.  I went, Eddie asked him.  Wait, let me go.  Let me backtrack this whole thing.  I was not going to the wedding.  Oh, you weren't?  At all.  Yeah.  Because I did not have a ride to the wedding.  All right.  I said, I do not have a ride. 
[01:46:30]  It was Eddie's suggestion.  It's like, you know, if you can get someone to go with you that has a ride, there's a couple  other people here from the station that are going.  Dude.  Earl, I love you.  You know.  That's great.  But let me tell you, let me tell you.  Nothing.  Hold on.  It was nothing.  Maybe it was your whole.  Nothing.  Hold on.  Maybe it was your approach.  Because you should have went, hey.  There was nothing.  Hey, Nadine.  Are you going to Eddie Trunk's wedding?  You are?  Great.  Can I get a ride?  There's nothing about the approach at all.  Nadine and the boyfriend didn't ask you to put on chauffeur uniform for that night, 
[01:47:00]  too, did they?  No.  There's nothing to do with it.  Nadine, you're the best friend I ever had.  I'm just trying to drive you to the wedding.  Take me to the Piggly Wiggly first.  Yes, Ms. Nadine.  Oh, Nadine's in the studio.  Nadine, how are you?  We called you a piece of ass because I thought you weren't employed anymore.  We didn't think you were here anymore, so please don't file any sexual harassment charges  against us.  So, did Earl ask you to Eddie Trunk's wedding?  Yes, he did.  He did.  So, what's wrong with that?  What's wrong with that?  There is nothing wrong with that. 
[01:47:30]  There's nothing wrong with that.  I didn't think there was anything wrong with that.  Oh, Earl, Earl, there's nothing wrong with it.  There's nothing wrong with asking a girl to a prom, a wedding.  We are both friends with Eddie.  We are neighbors.  She has a car.  It was obviously uncomfortable because see how he's reacting.  Earl, you know what you do, though?  How uncomfortable was it, Earl, when Nadine had to tell you that, can I bring my boyfriend?  Earl, you know what you got to do?  You got to aim a little lower than Nadine, though.  Maybe ask the El Salvadorian cleaning lady that comes in. 
[01:48:00]  That's true, man.  She'd suck it for a sandwich.  There was nothing, there's nothing.  Norton knows my experience.  Jesus Christ, oh my.  No, Earl, Earl, it's okay.  So, you asked her, and what did you actually say, Nadine?  Exactly what Earl just said.  I don't know why I said that, because I think that's really wrong.  That's rude.  Do you think you probably said the rudest goddamn thing?  That's so rude of me.  Why would you say that?  Earl's not going to try to go through that.  Hey, Nadine, there's nothing going on.  That is shot down.  I really took guts.  I don't know why I said that. 
[01:48:30]  Yeah, that's rude.  I know why, because you got scared.  You're like, oh my God, I think he's asking me out on a date, and I'm uncomfortable here.  Yeah.  And I do have a boyfriend, so I'm just going to tell him.  Because you see the way he looks at you when he talks to you.  It's not a good guy.  There's nothing to him, because we both know Eddie, and we're going to know what, and  he's getting married.  I know Eddie, too.  But then you had to call Eddie and say that you're bringing two people to his wedding.  Yeah, that's it.  Now, let me know what happened.  And you call up Eddie Trunk, and you ask.  I called Ed, and I said, because he needed to get the RSVP by Monday.  Right.  I called him on, I think it was Sunday or Monday, and I said, I can't go, but, I might 
[01:49:00]  have a ride, but there's a problem.  She might have to bring another person.  Yeah.  And then what happened?  What did he say?  He called me back and said, we're overloaded.  Oh, and then he, like, shoots the whole thing down.  Isn't that embarrassing?  Like, I don't need, I don't need another, oh, this whole thing is so awkwardly, I didn't  even get invited.  I don't sense the awkwardness in it. 
[01:49:30]  I told my boyfriend that I had done this, and he was so mad at me.  He's like, that is so rude.  How can you even say that?  Good for the boyfriend.  Good for him.  And I'm not going.  First of all, I wasn't invited.  You weren't invited, and I don't think you should go.  Nadine, man, you've got some set of brass balls.  I will not go.  Earl, I'll take it, and I'll drink it.  Earl, hold on.  This was going to be a bit.  Earl, I'm not going.  Earl, I got a song for you and Nadine. 
[01:50:00]  Who is this?  Oh, Jesus.  No, Earl.  Hang on, Earl.  Earl, don't go crazy, Earl.  Hang out.  Earl.  Oh, my God.  Earl's going to punch somebody.  Rick is in front of the door, and he's not letting Earl out of the studio.  Earl, it's okay.  Hang out.  Hang out.  I can't believe it.  Hang out.  Now the mic broke.  You broke the mic.  No, stop.  Hey, Pete Johnson's going to yell at you. 
[01:50:30]  Hang out, Earl.  We'll keep it track today.  Oh, my God.  Is he pissed.  We need a new PSA.  We need a new megaphone, and now we need a new microphone.  Is he pissed?  Earl, there.  That mic's fixed.  Look.  Because I feel so secure when we're together.  Everybody.  Lighters.  Yeah.  Every rocker has a soft side.  Everything's so clear.  Yeah.  And even once I walk.  Oh, this is awful.  All right.  You know, look who's on the phone.  Maybe he can shed some light on this. 
[01:51:00]  All right.  Let's go to Eddie Trunk.  The groom, Eddie Trunk.  What's up, boys?  How you doing, Ed?  Congrats on your wedding, by the way.  Yeah.  Thanks.  I'm down in Florida, actually, and I just got a call from Johnny Hardrock telling me that  I should call in, and then Rick called me, and I just heard a little bit of what's going  on on hold.  Well, here's what happened, as we understand it.  Earl was invited to your wedding.  He could bring a guest.  He asked Nadine, because Nadine lives, they live close together, and she has a car. 
[01:51:30]  So that's Earl's ride.  That's the only reason.  I'm not even disputing that.  No, that's what you're, everyone else is implying that.  Nadine, she's even implying that it was something more.  There's nothing else.  You don't think?  Zero.  Well, anyway, then Nadine decides that she says, okay, I'll go, but I want to bring my  boyfriend, to which, instead of Earl going, are you out of your mind for even suggesting  that?  He goes, let me call up Eddie.  I wasn't even thinking that.  Well, here's what I know, okay?  First, let me preface this by saying, you know, anybody who's had a wedding knows that 
[01:52:00]  it's pretty difficult to try to get everything in line and meet certain criteria for head  count, et cetera.  Right.  Everyone knows it's always, there's too many people.  Yeah.  Well, you know, Jim Norton's invitation gets lost.  I'm sorry.  Go ahead.  No, continue, Eddie.  Go ahead.  I invited Earl and a guest, and I got a phone call down here in Florida a couple days ago.  I reminded Earl that the RSVP date was this past Monday.  Right. 
[01:52:30]  And I didn't hear anything from him, and I said, what are you doing?  And then he called me back, and he said, listen, I don't have a ride.  And I said, well, you know, if you're really that hard up for a ride, there is a train that  goes right to where the church is.  If that works for you, if you can't make it, don't worry about it.  And he called me back, and then he said, well, he said, I can bring Nadine, but the only  way I can do that is she gets to bring her boyfriend as well, so can you give me a plus  two?  A plus two, like it's one of the heavy metal shows that Eddie's, uh, Earl, you got balls.  Earl's looking for comps. 
[01:53:00]  It's the poison show.  That's the only way I can go.  I need plus two.  If that's not a problem, I will not go.  Maybe, maybe Nadine's boyfriend will pass out, he drinks too much, and then Earl's got  to even know.  Yeah, hey, man, it's in.  There was enough.  Maybe the boyfriend drives.  No, no.  Earl, wait, no.  No, stop.  Oh, my God.  He's smashing the mic.  That's like a, that's a very expensive, uh, microphone.  Earl, you're scaring.  Watch the Judas Priest CDs.  Earl, you're scaring Lee Garrett.  Lee Garrett is petrified outside the studio.  Hey, Eddie, is Piazza going to the wedding? 
[01:53:30]  Um, I'm here, he's in spring training, so he's obviously not going to be able to be  there, but.  I was hoping I'd get to sit at this table.  Earl, Earl.  Ow.  Earl, look at that microphone now.  Earl, let him, let him go.  What do you want on that mic?  Let, let Earl go.  Don't hit, don't hit, leave Garrett on the way out.  Can I say something?  He's a teen idol.  He's a teen idol.  Yeah.  I'll finish to Earl.  Honestly, I know that he had no other agenda in asking me that.  He just knows that I love Eddie Trunk.  Uh-huh.  He asked me to go because, you know, he thought I would like it. 
[01:54:00]  I think I'm the one who created this whole mess.  Yes, you did.  You're a, that was so horrible.  You're a dirty girl.  Of me to ask that.  I didn't even think I would get away with it, but he said he would ask, so I was like,  okay.  But he knew that my boyfriend was going to say no.  I totally knew that, and that was cool.  I don't know why I just asked that.  I guess because I could.  That was crazy.  I told Earl, what I had told Earl was that I would give me a couple days because we still  had some last minute RSVPs coming, and if there were some people that couldn't make 
[01:54:30]  it and a spot opened up, I'd be happy to say, yeah, no problem, because it wouldn't  have been a problem.  But then I found out that we're like exactly on our number, and there was no way that it  would work without setting us into a different area of money.  I totally understand how that works.  Just to be put in that position is just horrid.  Like, I invited him and a guest, and he wants to bring two people.  Here's the thing.  Here's what Earl's going to learn.  I found that Nadine had a boyfriend when I first met her.  I never went more than, hey, I nodded her.  There you go.  I never talked to her again because she's hot and she has a boyfriend. 
[01:55:00]  We have nothing in common.  You don't ask a girl with a boyfriend to a wedding because she's going to want to bring  him.  I would never say that at all, but the only thing is that I only see him once a week,  so I figured he was going to be at my house anyway.  Nadine, hold on.  Pete Johnson is in the studio now.  Pete, did you see what Earl did to the mic?  Nobody white did that.  Pete, did you see that?  Can you believe that?  I don't know what you guys do to him.  He took the mic and he slammed it onto the top of the counter, so I don't even know if 
[01:55:30]  the mic works anymore.  Never mind the wire ripped right out of it.  Let Pete fix the mic.  Get on that side.  It's my job.  I can do it.  Pete's not happy.  This studio is his baby.  Yeah.  I thought Opie did something.  Opie, Opie.  All right.  Check that mic.  Is it going to work?  Does it work?  No.  Pete.  Oh, it kind of works.  It'll work?  Hello.  Pete, you're a genius.  Thank you.  You fixed it again. 
[01:56:00]  Where's Earl?  I got to talk to him.  You got to fix Earl now.  I think a lobotomy might do it.  All right.  Okay.  Wow.  Earl lost his friggin' mind.  Guys, how did this even come up on me?  Where did this even come from?  Was it Earl saying it?  Nadine had a little going away thing last night and Earl decided to ask her at the going  away thing.  Actually, no.  That's not true.  He didn't ask me yesterday.  I kind of slipped and said that because I had too much to drink.  And I didn't realize having Ben, Stinky, and everybody else there. 
[01:56:30]  Yeah.  They made a field day out of that.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Ben called me immediately, matter of fact.  That's my fault.  I'm like, Ben, what's so important?  He couldn't even talk.  He was laughing so hard.  He gets Earl so pissed.  Earl's ulcer right now.  Looks like the girl we shot the blood at yesterday.  Good for the boyfriend for saying no.  You got to respect that guy.  He's like, no way.  Yeah.  Yeah.  That guy, he must have a big yule because he's willing to let her go.  He's like, I'm not coming.  Just go with him.  Yeah.  Oh, wait a minute.  So Nadine, even if I could have gotten a plus Q, he wasn't coming anyway? 
[01:57:00]  Well, no.  Yeah.  Actually, he feels really uncomfortable about it and he didn't want to go to Stanley.  Well, he should.  Because he knew that he wasn't invited.  Well, Matt Devotee's on the line.  He'll give Earl a ride.  It's no big deal.  Earl's got to go to Eddie Trunk's wedding.  Yeah.  That's not what this is about.  Earl, I was kind of hoping you would say no because he didn't want to go anyway.  I would not have put you through that.  Like, I don't think that's right either.  Look at Nadine talking to Earl, knowing Earl's at his desk on the other side of the building  listening right now.  Fuming.  I'm safer here. 
[01:57:30]  Fuming.  All right.  See, the only thing I can say is that I did say to Earl that there were alternatives,  offered him viable alternatives to get there, train other people that might have been coming  from the area.  And what he came back to me with was this scenario of Nadine plus one, which, you know, again,  nothing against Nadine.  I mean, like I said, I would have liked it about everybody, but you just, the size of  my family, it's just the wedding's out of control as it is, so it just wasn't going  to work.  It was like trying to get tickets for somebody.  It was like, yeah, I need a plus two, you know? 
[01:58:00]  Yeah.  All right.  All right, Eddie.  Well, good luck to you.  Thank you.  Have a good wedding, and we'll talk to you soon, all right?  I appreciate it.  Congratulations, man.  Yeah.  Thank you.  See you guys.  Thanks, Nadine.  Good luck at the new job.  Thank you.  Have fun.  Thanks, guys.  I'll miss you.  You hot piece of...  Thank you.  I thought she was gone, and we could talk that way.  All right, Ant.  Yeah.  And we'll be back with the Opie and Anthony Show.  What's the meaning of this slacking off?  Dude, it's all we need!  Whatever.  The Opie and Anthony Show. 
[01:58:30]  A smorgasbord of idiocy.  The greatest radio that I've ever heard.  N-E-W.  This damn show is turning into a soap opera.  It is the Opie and Anthony Show.  Listeners not feeling the cigarette trick now, eh?  I know.  Yeah.  Although, we might have a line on a dumpster. 
[01:59:00]  Hello?  Might have a line on some dumpster diving.  Yeah.  Jeff, what's going on?  What's going on?  Hey, bro.  Tell us.  I've seen people do the cigarette trick so many times.  You've got so much alive in your mouth.  As soon as you put the cigarette in there, that's it.  The cigarette goes out.  It don't hurt you.  Oh, boy.  It doesn't do anything to you.  Oh, true.  If you want to do something really, tell her to put the cigarette out with a balloon knot.  Oh, boy.  That'd be something nice.  All right, Joe.  I'm going to put it out on an ass cheek.  Thank you, Jeff.  Let's go to Michael. 
[01:59:30]  Michael, what's up?  Hey, Opie and Anthony.  How you doing?  Oh, Michael with the radio voice.  What's up, Mike?  That sounds like Jim Florentine.  Come on, man.  Guys, guys, guys.  This radio whore, man.  I mean, you know, she's talking about putting a cigarette out in her tongue.  I mean, it is easy.  Yeah.  You just pull up the saliva in your tongue and you stick it out.  And you know something, Norton?  Yes, sir.  You're pathetic, man.  But now it's like you've got your tongue shoved up her a** so deep you could taste her breakfast.  I mean, it's getting ridiculous.  I'm pathetic and you use an up the thing so far I can taste that lime? 
[02:00:00]  What are you talking about?  He was sitting there worshipping this girl and she's name dropping and she's talking  about a radio show and everything else.  Who cares, sir?  When you're knee deep in box, are you really thinking of any of that other dribble?  There's some truth to that.  All right.  And Michael was just trying to keep it clean for the radio there, Jim.  Yeah, good job.  All right.  Well, the dumpster thing is the way she should go, guys.  All right?  All right.  Thank you.  Talk to you.  Bye.  People are not happy with the cigarette on the tongue thing.  Get Carrie back in here.  Yeah, we have another girl that'll do the dumpster thing. 
[02:00:30]  We can throw her in nude and stuff.  Josh.  Guys, you're saying you want to be better than last year.  If this girl gets in this contest, she's going to be dreaming about a dumpster.  She's going to be sitting in there trying to taste what a dumpster tastes like.  This cigarette thing, it's a waste, man.  Why not?  There's no trick to it.  It's called pain management, dick.  All right.  That's my girl.  A lot of people say that it's an easy thing to do, though.  Yeah, I want to see them come in here and do it.  Pain management, dick.  I don't know if I could do it.  Everyone's saying it's lean, though. 
[02:01:00]  Yeah, no one's thinking it's, like, above and beyond.  I want to see any of these callers, if they think they're so big and bad and tough, come in here.  You put a cigarette on your tongue, and then after you're crying in pain, I'll kick you in the butt.  Uh-oh.  Hard words there.  Wow.  Hold on, now.  You're taking your balloon knot.  That's better.  Oh, I, wow.  Those are fighting words.  Oh, yeah, yeah, okay.  How about I'll grab pliers and pinch your vasdevans?  Yeah, what's up? 
[02:01:30]  We're getting requests for those calls.  We're going to have to bring you in today.  Robin, what's up?  Nothing.  I was thinking maybe you could wipe off our tongue so it's nice and dry.  That's fine.  Nice and crackly.  Crackly.  There is no trick to it.  It doesn't matter.  Either that or try the cigar.  I like the cigar.  I like the cigar.  Yeah, I kind of like the cigar.  Put it out right on her.  You can't do that.  Why not?  Well, you could do that, but you just can't say it.  You know something? 
[02:02:00]  Your popularity with the listeners, not with the staff here.  Not you.  Shut up.  Jack off.  Thanks, Robin.  Uh-huh.  My popularity, yes.  Uh-huh.  Uh-huh.  You've done the survey.  You know my popularity.  I'm looking at the instant feedbacks.  Your popularity is dropping quickly.  You're going to have to do something.  You're going to have to do something.  You're coming across a little too cocky for our listeners.  You know whose popularity is going to skyrocket?  Dumpster chick.  Yeah, dumpster chick.  Well, you want to know how would you feel if you drove, like, really far and you spent 
[02:02:30]  the last of your money to get down here?  Whining, bitching, and complaining does not make your popularity go up with the listeners,  miss.  Okay.  Turn around, Norton.  Hey.  Well, there you go.  That's going to help your popularity.  She's going further.  Oh, yeah.  Guys, she's naked.  Come on.  Almost.  Very close.  Very close.  Dead a little naked.  Don't be shy.  Oh, look.  Hey, wow.  Very well trimmed, I see.  Is it?  Can't tell.  You keep yourself very trimmed.  All right.  You can stay as long as you like. 
[02:03:00]  Thank you.  Wow, Wayne.  What a dish.  You want me to put a cigarette on my tongue now?  Because it's almost done.  See?  You've got other ones, don't you?  Mm-hmm.  I have a whole box.  Yeah.  I'll stop worry about it.  Mary wants to pipe in here.  Mary, you're next on the O.P. and Anthony show.  Hey, boys.  I just want to say that I'll let Norton put a cigarette or a cigar.  Even better, a cigar out on my hand.  Just to shut this bitch up.  I'm tired of her.  Stop wanting.  Whatever.  Oh, boy.  Oh, boy.  Come on up here.  Come on.  Come on.  I would, but I'm cooking, didn't I? 
[02:03:30]  Oh, yeah.  Why don't you watch some country music and look at my bush and you'll see how not sad I am.  Ooh, yeah.  Mm-hmm.  Whoa.  Oh, hey.  Whoa.  The big C word cannot be used on our airwaves.  Why don't you go back to your box of Twinkies, chick?  Ooh.  Ooh.  Whatever.  I will be afraid of tomorrow.  Oh, just give me two minutes with you.  I will f*** you up.  Oh, yeah?  Oh, yeah?  Oh, yeah?  Hey, hey, hey.  Hold on.  Mary, Mary, you cannot curse.  Come on up here.  You cannot curse.  Come on.  Right now.  Come on.  Come on.  Right now.  Please, you're killing us. 
[02:04:00]  I'm sorry.  She's just talking and talking.  It's about pain management.  Wait, which Mary is this?  You know who it is.  You want to come on?  No, I mean, it's not pain management.  It's about putting saliva on your tongue, and that's not even touching the surface of your  tongue.  So that's not.  All right, Mary.  All right, thank you.  Bye, guys.  She was a little potty mouth.  Yeah.  Go get banged by 10 more million guys, Mary.  Whoa.  Nice comeback.  Why don't we just cut off half her foot so she can't run? 
[02:04:30]  Yeah, come on, guys.  I said language.  I think I got a peak.  I was very angry.  All right, well, it's decision time.  I'm feeling angry.  And it's decision time.  What are we going to do here?  Carrie, is there anything else to spice it up a bit?  Well, what if I'm, like, naked, like, in a pretzel, putting a cigarette on my tongue?  That pretzel thing.  You're really pushing that.  Let's do the pretzel thing.  It's really good, though.  I mean, my feet over my head, how many people can do that?  And, like, staying like that.  Okay.  Can we stick her head in the toilet? 
[02:05:00]  No.  Stop it.  That toilet is so gross.  No one's cleaning it.  Come on.  Just have her stick her head in the toilet for, like, five seconds under the water.  Her cigarette stuff is stupid.  Jesus, Rick.  Her pretzel stuff is stupid.  Stick her head in the toilet.  Rick.  Because it'll shut her up at the same time.  Come on.  Jeez, Rick.  You know, usually, you know.  What did I do to you, Rick?  I, exactly.  You're annoying.  I think Rick's on to something.  Oh, my God.  Are you kidding?  I like the swirly in the toilet idea.  Maybe for another girl if Carrie's not into it.  Well, you know, because a lot of these girls are saying they'll do anything. 
[02:05:30]  That's a good idea, man.  She's leaving.  Hey, what happened to her?  What happened?  No, no.  Wait, wait, wait.  Where did you go?  She just called Rick a D-head.  Rick, what did you do?  I said what I said.  You're ruining it.  Rick.  All right, bring her back in.  I want to see what her problem is with you.  Rick.  It's funny, man.  Rick.  I know.  I know the deal.  I'm getting vibes.  I've got to see more.  Chewing up airtime for nothing. 
[02:06:00]  Carrie, what's wrong?  I've got to see more chat.  Carrie, what's wrong?  What happened?  I came like two and a half hours.  I know.  I lost my money to get down here.  Right.  And?  And?  Mm-hmm.  What?  How dare he?  What?  Rick.  What did I f***ing do to you?  Hey, whoa.  You cursed, you did.  All right, all right, all right, all right.  You can't say the F word.  Yeah.  Sorry.  Honey, we need something from you.  You're dragging us down.  I talked to you on the show.  The listeners don't want to hear this.  They don't want to hear you talk.  They want to hear you scream out of pain. 
[02:06:30]  Because then we're going to stuff your body into a 55-gallon drum and torture you for  four hours.  So let's do it.  Let's rock.  I came up with some good ideas.  You think you're going to put a cigarette on your tongue?  I want to see you do it.  It's cake.  Everybody says, oh, it's no big deal.  All the smokers do it.  Everybody says it's no big deal.  Big deal.  They're on the phone.  They're not in here.  Rick sounds like an old weaver.  Let me tell you.  We've got to play the old weaver play.  I don't care.  Every time Earl Weaver's mentioned, we've got to play the thing.  I'll put a cigarette on my arm.  You think I'm afraid of something? 
[02:07:00]  I have no pain in my arm.  Stick your head in the toilet.  Five seconds.  Hold your breath.  We won't flush it.  I promise.  Maybe if your toilet wasn't so nasty, I would.  What's wrong with our toilet?  Yeah.  How are you?  You've insulted us.  Yeah.  I'm with her on this one.  That is one disgusting toilet.  All over the floor.  Oh, wow.  Yeah.  Oh, my God.  We are going to run out of delay so quickly.  I'm sorry.  We can't say that P word.  Maybe you missed the footage of me grabbing, but that's quite a specimen. 
[02:07:30]  All right.  We've got to work this out.  I'll put my head in the toilet, and then I'll put a cigarette on my arm, and then I'll beat  the crap out of Rick.  Bring it.  Oh, I like it.  Bring it.  I like it.  Rick, don't egg on girls to fight you.  Dude, if she's going to stick her head in the toilet, okay.  Hey, I am starting a movement right now to have NyQuil removed from the shelves.  It is a dangerous drug.  It really is bad.  Rick.  If I didn't have a Jimmy Dean hairdo, I'd really be annoyed.  Rick.  Did you hear how tough he sounded, too? 
[02:08:00]  Bring it on.  Bring it on, slim girl.  Slim, dainty chick.  Come on.  Bring it on, birth and hips.  Bring it on.  I like her.  Oh, Jesus Christ.  She's got spunk, and she's going to kick your ass, Rick.  I think so, too, Rick.  You best just settle down there, Mr. Cold.  You're high on something.  Oh, wait.  I got it.  I got it.  Wait, wait.  We can't.  We're almost out of dump.  We are that close.  And then it goes to music, right?  And then they, um...  Well. 
[02:08:30]  Yeah.  Ixnay on the hippie.  Rick.  You really got to settle down and maybe do some lines of coke to bring yourself back up.  I need to balance out.  You like doing poor man's speed balls there with your cold medicine.  I didn't see you come up with any ideas.  I talked to you on the...  I didn't see you on the...  Yeah, Rick.  She did talk to you, man.  And I came up with a bunch of ideas.  Hey, stupid.  Hello.  You listen to the radio.  Excuse me, darling.  It says come up with an idea, then call up and come down and do it.  Excuse me, darling.  It's not you.  Hey, I'm going to show up. 
[02:09:00]  It's 141.  Tell me what to do.  What are you?  Oh, look.  I'm a car.  But I won't take my pants off.  I did call the show with a bunch of ideas.  And none of them were any good.  Yeah, that's why you told me it would come on down.  That it was great.  That you talked it over with them and it was a great idea.  Well, you know what?  Your jazzing up of your human pretzels still sucked.  What can I tell you?  We tried.  I tried to work it with you, but they didn't want it.  You're making everyone a little uncomfortable, Rick. 
[02:09:30]  What?  It's not nothing that doesn't need to be said, for Christ's sakes.  I kind of liked the idea.  I was going along with the goddamn slip and slide.  Fine by me.  I thought that was good.  Apparently it's not good enough for Rick.  Obviously, it isn't Rick's show.  Obviously, Rick doesn't have a radio show.  I have had a radio show, douchebag.  Oh, because you have one right now.  No, you're just flying with someone else's coattails.  Oh, oh, oh, ow, that hurts. 
[02:10:00]  Let me go cry in a corner.  Jesus Christ.  Jesus, Rick.  What the hell's got into this guy?  You're tired.  NyQuil.  Cold medicine should have a warning label on it.  She just, blah, blah, blah.  Oh, you want to see my tattoo?  No, we don't want to see your stupid tattoo.  We want you to endure some pain.  I come up with a bunch of things.  Stick your head in the toilet.  I'll leave.  It will shut you up.  And you'll be in.  Oh, my God.  No, Rick. 
[02:10:30]  Rick, see what you've done now, Rick.  Rick, look what you did.  He's leaving.  Stupid furry boots.  Where's furry boots?  She's a nice dumper, though, Rick.  Now she's leaving.  Rick, you haven't made me laugh in a long time.  This is hilarious.  How many times will she come back?  I say five.  Five.  We're on.  This will be two.  Earth and hips.  Someone talk her into coming back.  Yeah.  Rick, talk her into coming back.  Yeah.  Yeah, this isn't good.  Oh, my God.  Rick just loses his mind.  Yeah. 
[02:11:00]  This isn't good.  They're talking to her outside the studio.  Holy smoke.  I love when it gets uncomfortable.  John from Jersey.  Hey, it's Psycho Rick.  Mad Max is funny on the quill.  Put her head in the toilet for an hour.  Ben, what's going on?  Ben loves his stuff, too.  She's just swearing, yelling, skim, so Norton's out there, like, hugging her.  Come on.  Just come back in.  It's okay.  You're doing great.  You want to be in radio?  Come on.  He's still trying to get a piece.  Yeah, exactly.  He's just trying to get laid.  Norton's the type of guy that goes to a funeral to get the sympathy F. 
[02:11:30]  Yeah.  Here we go.  Oh, I'm sorry.  All right.  Carrie.  Now, Rick.  Are you crying?  Yeah.  How you doing, man?  There's no crying on the Opie and Anthony show.  I'm pissed.  All right.  And, Will, you should be.  Do you have something to say to Rick?  Rick is being a tool.  I'm waiting for an apology from him.  Rick.  No, Molly Ringwald.  I'm not going to give you an apology.  Stick your head in the toilet.  Stick your head in the toilet.  I already said I would.  I want to stick your head in the toilet.  So do it.  Shut up and do it. 
[02:12:00]  Zip it.  You are such an ugly moron, okay?  And you are a loser.  And I can't wait for you to have a nervous breakdown and wind up in the mental hospital.  Okay.  Okay.  Hopefully you'll be in the room right next door so I can shove your head in the toilet.  No, I hope so so I can kill you while you're sleeping.  Oh, nice.  I know you are, but what am I?  That was good.  That was a good comeback.  As I take a knife to your throat.  Oh, wow.  No better yet, a gun to your head.  Oops.  There would be nothing but hollow when it came out.  And then get two guns. 
[02:12:30]  And then maybe get a cannon and chew it at my head.  Oh, wow.  That's not nice.  Go kiss Opie's butt a little bit more.  Okay.  Why don't you talk about the radio show you have in college?  Sweetheart, sweetheart, I bet if Opie wasn't marrying your sister, you wouldn't be working  here.  I don't have a job anymore.  I missed that one.  If Opie wasn't marrying your sister, I'm sure you would still be working here.  Opie's not marrying my sister, so there you go, Molly.  You know what Rick sounds like? 
[02:13:00]  This is exactly what I heard coming through the hotel wall in New Orleans when he was yelling  at his wife.  When I lost my ATM card.  When you lost your ATM card.  You're a nasty, bitter man, Rick.  Wow.  You're a nasty, bitter man, Rick.  Carries all this stuff.  It's a good way to keep your job, Rick, isn't it?  Because you're so confident.  I am.  Yeah.  That's why I'm here, douchebag, and you're still out unemployed.  Okay.  Okay.  You don't know anything about me.  I don't know.  My resume is so much better than yours.  Oh my God.  Everybody, everybody listen up.  She's going to tell us about her resume.  This is going to be great radio. 
[02:13:30]  Holy cow.  Hey, hot jobs.  Get ready.  It's going to be a big resume taking space on your internet site that she's going to put  up there, and Jesus Christ, everybody's going to want to hire you.  You know what, sweetheart?  Darling, Rick, look at me.  Wow.  All right.  Wow.  Rick.  So, are you going to stick her head in the toilet?  I've never seen him like this before.  Tell you the truth.  I think it's the cold medicine.  Yeah.  He's freaked out.  There's actually an intelligent woman in the room, and he can't deal with it. 
[02:14:00]  What's that?  Are we all right?  Everyone's going to be okay?  I'm cool.  Well, as long as she sticks her head in the toilet.  I don't want to jump in and mind anybody.  Yes, yes.  Sometimes you let cooler heads as everybody settles down for a couple minutes.  Settle down a bit.  Separate these two, I think.  That'll give you more time to comfort her.  Look, this has nothing to do with the fact that I think she's really sexy, and I like  her.  That's a secondary thing.  Okay, we could do that.  Nice haircut.  Oh, you got me again.  We did that in haircuttery. 
[02:14:30]  That's three times you said that joke.  Yeah.  You're worse than Voss.  Yeah.  I'm sorry.  He's not funny.  Voss, I know.  I love Voss.  At least Voss is talent, sweetheart.  I love Voss.  All right.  All right.  So why don't we...  That's a moron.  Why don't we separate these two for a bit, and you can sit outside with Norton, maybe.  He can help you out.  All right.  No, Jim, you're staying right here.  Yeah, you've got to stay here.  It's about what she wants to leave.  I've got to...  All right.  Stinky, could you escort the lovely lady outside, and then we'll have you come back in. 
[02:15:00]  Don't go anywhere.  Don't go nowhere, though.  Holy Jesus.  You lost your mind, Rick.  And we'll be back with the Opie and Anthony Show.  Let's rock.  You guys are able.  You sound like a fruity stick in the mud.  I hate you.  Sew up that worthless slot.  The Opie and Anthony Show. 
[02:15:30]  N-E-W.  1-0-2-7-W-N-E-W.  New York.  I want you to be free.  Don't worry about me.  And just like the movies, we play out on the last scene.  Phone numbers for New York, 877-692-1027. 
[02:16:00]  For everyone else listening to us, you want to get a hold of the show, 866-277-4WOW.  Ebony, what's up?  Hello?  Hey, baby.  I can hear you.  What's up?  Your name's Ebony?  Yeah.  So, what's up today?  Nah, y'all was commenting on, like, earlier, how y'all was talking about how y'all see, like,  you know, y'all see us coming to y'all area and swim and stuff like that, but y'all don't  see us flying down the mountain like y'all idiots, because that's just not our thing.  That's not our thing.  I mean...  Hold on. 
[02:16:30]  Let me get my universal translator.  Let's do that.  Nah, I mean...  Y'all flying down the mountain.  It's not my thing.  Oh, you're saying Whitey's crazy for skiing.  For skiing.  I got you now.  Whitey crazy for skiing.  Yeah.  You know something?  I'll agree with you on that.  Skiing is a pretty dangerous goddamn thing to do.  It's a recreation.  So, you're on Earl's side.  You wouldn't go down the mountain?  Oh, no, yeah, I'm on his side.  I mean...  I mean, I guess we value our life more than y'all.  Y'all. 
[02:17:00]  Yup.  I think she thinks me.  That means use guys.  Right.  Use guys if you were in certain parts of Brooklyn.  Yeah, you don't do that.  What do you do for fun?  Play basketball, hang out.  Yeah?  Yeah.  With the bullets flying over your head, like girl said?  Rob a white person.  Yeah.  I hear that basketball.  For the sake of skiing, we don't put up a fight.  That basketball could be dangerous, Earl was telling us.  Nah, I mean...  That's just not our thing.  I mean, y'all just crazy, point blank.  Yeah.  Ain't no if, buts, and there's a body. 
[02:17:30]  I mean, y'all...  Where are you from, baby?  Brooklyn.  Brooklyn in the high-ah.  What'd she say that you guys left in the mission?  No if, buts, and there's about it.  No if, buts, and there's about it?  I mean, no.  No, I'm serious.  I used to hang out with white people at one time.  Yeah?  And I mean, we'd all be on a...  We'd be all cool, and then all of a sudden, one of them just snap.  Go crazy.  I mean...  What's up with that?  I don't know.  No, it's hilarious.  In general, we do try to hang with each other, and we're like, man, I just don't understand 
[02:18:00]  what you're...  Our culture is...  What people are all about.  Our cultures are so different that it is very hard.  It's so funny to hear you talk.  No, no.  I'm serious.  I used to hang out with Whitey, and man, I just didn't get it.  That was whack.  That was whack.  Whitey is whack.  Whack.  What did Whitey do that was kind of silly when you used to hang out with Whitey?  It's all the ifs, there's, and buts.  I mean...  Like what?  I just put it like this.  Yeah.  We don't understand y'all, y'all don't understand us.  Yeah.  I mean, when a Black person get upset, at least you'll know it.  They just start squealing on you, you know what I mean?  But a White person, I mean, they just snap. 
[02:18:30]  You don't even know when they get in there.  One minute, one minute, and then they don't say nothing.  You don't know.  Yeah.  And if you don't say, they just stand in there in my coat, and they go, Billy, I can't  take it anymore.  What the hell is your problem?  You know, this chick is so right, man.  I like this girl.  Ebony, you're all right.  You're right.  You're right.  Like, see, I work with a lot of people, you know, work with a lot of people on my job.  And what do you do?  What do you do for a living?  No, I'm in school.  I'm still in school.  I'm just, I'm an internship with New York City Transit. 
[02:19:00]  Oh, yeah?  Let me try something.  Yeah, what's up?  Ebony?  Uh-huh?  Do you make the cheddar?  No doubt.  Yeah.  No doubt.  Yeah, baby.  You get the benefits?  No doubt.  Yeah, that's what I'm talking about.  But see, where we crash at is that a lot of us try to make it a career.  It's not a career.  It's just an in-and-out thing when you need quick cash.  North or South Korea?  Huh?  Oh, I thought you said Korea.  What's this in-and-out thing?  I mean, like, you need quick cash. 
[02:19:30]  What you going to do?  Um, get a job.  See, you don't see it like us.  What are you going to do?  Stick a white nigga up.  That's quick fun.  Stick a white nigga up.  That's what I'm talking about.  Yeah.  Yeah?  Yeah.  What's the best white nigga to hit?  What do they look like?  Nah, you go for the grandmas.  Oh, jeez.  Just smash their purse.  They be having mad loot.  They be having mad loot. 
[02:20:00]  Yeah?  Hey, I learned that with Grand Theft Auto 3.  Mad loot.  Yeah, you hit the grandmas.  All of a sudden, there's money all over the street.  So this girl speaks the truth.  Yeah.  I'm serious, though.  I don't know what they're doing.  You know, I guess they be saving it or something.  They ain't got nothing to spend it on.  Stay at home, watch soap opera.  They's waiting for you to hit them over the heat.  No, baby.  How do you do it?  What do you use?  Knife?  Anything that I got.  And what do you do?  You go up to the old bag and say what?  Be like, don't even turn around.  One time I used a bottle. 
[02:20:30]  I ain't had nothing.  I just put it to her neck and I was like, give me your purse.  No problem.  Never take it.  I was like, no problem.  One time I just snatched it and ran.  She ain't going to chase me because she can't run.  Hey, do you mug black people, too?  Nah, only when I'm, but I really, you know, I ain't got no white people.  Yeah, but black people kick your ass, right?  No, but they chase you.  Grandma chase you as old as she is.  Grandma, she'll take a shoe off and hit you with it.  Damn right. 
[02:21:00]  Who are you?  I ain't calling you, lady.  Well, she's being honest today, Anthony.  Wow.  Are you one of those hot bitches?  I wouldn't call myself that.  You got some junk in the trunk?  Nah, I wouldn't really say that.  I'm kind of heavy set.  I'm just cool to chill with.  You ever have a white guy?  Oh, hell no.  No?  I'm a white guy rubbing up on me.  Boy, this is so odd, our differences in culture.  You don't like white people, like, rubbing up against you?  I mean. 
[02:21:30]  What's the problem with that?  First of all, they're not big enough.  Right.  We all know that.  Rub it in, bitch.  See, the black people love that stereotype, Anthony.  Yeah.  Of course.  They have no problem with that stereotype.  Yeah.  I guess, you know, like, you ain't going to f*** a white bitch, right?  Oh, hey, hold on.  Oh, oh, oh, oh.  Hold on.  Yeah, yeah, that F word.  That F word they don't seem to like.  I'm sorry.  Whitey's crazy.  They hear that F word and they freak out.  So what were you saying? 
[02:22:00]  All right, like I'm saying, you see a white, you know, I mean, all right, not say white,  but if you see a fat chick, that's just going to turn you off completely, right?  Most guys would say that.  Most likely.  So it's the same with us.  Well, with me.  You don't like the whitey?  Nah, I've got to stick with my own color.  Yeah, you're like, what, guys that you know ain't going to be around for a while, right?  No, I wouldn't say that.  Like guys that might give you a crack in the face, right?  Oh, hell no.  Mid-stroke.  Oh, hell no.  That ain't happening to me. 
[02:22:30]  Ebony, I've got to ask you, the darker, the better?  Not really.  Not necessarily.  I hear there's a little racism within the black community.  If you're a little lighter than the others, you know.  Yeah, I hear the lighter black people don't like the darker black people.  No, because...  We had this discussion on our show, and they came out of the woodwork saying, yeah, that's  the truth.  Nah, because my mother, she's man-like, but I came out dark like my pops.  You're like your pops.  Yeah.  And how old were you when he left?  No, my pops are still around, baby. 
[02:23:00]  There's 15 of us, all with the same mom and dad.  Wow.  Wow, look at that.  Called the Guinness Book of World Records.  So our niggas don't mess with us.  Wow.  How white is your mom?  She's from the South.  She's just light-skinned.  She got a little Cherokee and some kind of other Indian.  Yeah, all you black people say you got Indian in you.  Well, the majority of them do.  I want to open up a mother effing casino.  I'm a Cherokee, mother effing.  I'm going to sell my own cigarettes.  You know why most of them don't.  Tax-free, mother effing. 
[02:23:30]  On the real.  You know why most of them really do?  Why?  Because, like, when the white man came in and all of that, most of them, they went to, like, the Indian camps to stay out of slavery.  They ran away, and they would join in with the Indians and stuff like that.  Learn your history, baby.  I'm an Indian, B.  I'm an Indian.  Don't be taking me back to the slave camp.  And then, see, not only that, it's that they got more respect from the Indians, you know?  Well, of course.  You was all niggas back then.  Holla.  Yeah.  I'm proud to be a nigger.  That's the history, man. 
[02:24:00]  That was how the white man felt about the situation.  But see, it's okay for a colored person to call me a nigger, but when a white person calls me a nigger, it's something else.  You know what I mean?  I hear that.  Like, if a black person, a white person woke up to you and called me a nigger, you know, I'd get offended.  I'd probably thump on him.  Oh, yeah.  Same thing like if a black person woke up to you and be like, hey, yo, cracker.  I don't care.  I don't care about that.  I would just, I wouldn't be able to hear it because I'd be running so quickly away from him.  I'd be running so fast, I wouldn't even hear it. 
[02:24:30]  I would be running to try to find a policeman.  Honey, have you learned yet the police is never there when you need them?  They're there when we need them.  I got to go find myself a policeman.  You need them.  They're never there.  You don't want them to pull over.  Just like that.  I hear you.  Actually, in a lot of the projects, when the cops show up to bust the drug dealers, they give the cops crap.  And then all of a sudden, the big, you know, a big fat mama will come out of the house and say, 
[02:25:00]  why the police ain't here when my child gets killed?  But then every time they show up, they're throwing stuff off the roofs at them.  What the hell's up with that?  No, you see, when the police do show up, all they do is harass.  We'll tell you the truth.  They harass.  They're arresting criminals.  When they show up, somebody called them.  There's a crime going on.  We only need them for one thing. 
[02:25:30]  I say for the females, they really only need the cops for one thing.  It's who and her nigga beating her.  If they ain't got the guts to stab them, then, hey, she's going to call the police.  Man, this chick is wrong.  This chick is wrong, man.  They ain't got the guts to stab them.  Yes.  Ebony, what is that in the relationship sometimes?  Black guys like beating up the women sometimes.  No, I guess it's most likely if you let them, then they do it.  Although, I will also say, if you watch cops down south, man, the white guys love beating their women down there.  Oh, hell no.  The day a white man beat me, I'll be in jail. 
[02:26:00]  Really?  That's why I would never go down south.  No?  Nah, because I heard, like, in certain parts of the damn south, there's a lot of prejudice stuff going on.  Get out of here.  I thought we were all over that.  I wish.  I can't deal with that, because as soon as a white person say, hey, nigga, I'm going to shoot you ass.  I'm going to shoot you ass.  I'm going to shoot you ass.  Hey, how close do you live to Martin Luther King Boulevard?  Well, I live in East New York.  Oh, yeah.  Right.  They don't have one in the area?  Nah, not really.  That's a nice neighborhood. 
[02:26:30]  I've been thinking of moving there.  I was staying there.  I've been thinking of leaving Bay Ridge and going over to East New York.  Yeah, it's one last minute, baby.  One last minute.  I'd read the sign that says East New...  Now, hold on.  Joe wants in on this.  Joe.  Yo, Joe, what's up?  Here's me.  Welcome to East New...  What's up, man?  What's up, Joe?  What's up, my newbie in Queen Avenue?  Yo, I think, man, you can bring some street credibility to this show.  Holla, baby.  Have you ever heard of Old Dirty... 
[02:27:00]  What is his name?  Old Dirty Dominican...  Whatever his name is.  I don't...  Who cares?  You don't listen to the show?  I listen to it sometimes.  You know by listening to him, he ain't got no street credibility, baby.  Why listen to us when there's Hot 97?  Yeah, let me shout my block.  Let me shout my block.  Yo, um, hey, you ever been locked up?  Yeah, of course.  Of course.  Of course.  It's like going to elementary school.  Well, it was me and my cousin, we was rolling, police came up to call a little marijuana, you know, for the stupid stuff. 
[02:27:30]  How much time you get for that?  Practically nothing.  What's up with that?  And what's up with that?  What's up with that?  What's up with that?  Jason Williams?  I wish.  I got caught with a Tech-9.  They said I tried to rob somebody, but I just, like, slapped him in the face with it, and he threw his jacket at me, right?  I get chased from Elizabeth down in Jersey City.  I get 10 charges put on me.  What?  19 years old, I get 10 years sentenced.  But, dude, you hit him with a machine gun.  Yeah, but it wasn't loaded.  What? 
[02:28:00]  I wanted to shoot him.  I wanted to scare him a little bit, you know what I'm saying?  I want to try.  I get chased from Elizabeth.  I'll be home, I'm going to say.  The guy's got a point.  Yeah, but how about Jason Williams?  He blew the man's head off.  Well, Jason Williams got a lot of money.  Yeah, well, baby.  Yeah.  He's a celebrity.  Yeah, I guess so, man.  Yeah, man.  Hey, you guys, teach us a few new words, man.  My cheddar's getting a little old.  I need something new.  That's old.  I know what a hoopty is.  I know cheddar. 
[02:28:30]  That's old school.  I know.  What else did they have?  How about trigonology?  Don't get fooled by the white man.  Trigonology?  Trigonology, yeah.  Why do they call it that?  Well, you know, you get white men telling you one thing in the paper, and as you know,  they're lying to you.  It's the conspiracy, right?  Yeah, like a conspiracy.  Yeah.  Trigonology.  You know that is right, haven't you?  You guys are crazy.  We don't have enough time to worry about that.  We're trying to survive our own damn self.  That's great.  Oh, hey, I've been seeing you since I've been swimming in my daddy's big yam bag. 
[02:29:00]  Right, the yam bag.  Yeah.  Yo, listen, I got to run.  I say yam bag while I'm living.  Do you mean literally you got to run?  What, are the cops coming?  Right.  Nah, I just got to go.  Hey, Ebony, real fast.  Give us one word.  Leave us with a new word.  Yaki.  That's a new word.  Yaki.  Yaki?  Yeah, that's, you know, that's the braids the newbie and queens put in their hair because  they both are headed.  Because they both are headed.  Yo, yo, you know, I wanted to know, I wanted to ask Ebony, when you fight, how do y'all's  newbie and queens hold on to each other's hair? 
[02:29:30]  It's so short.  I mean, the hair on my legs is longer than the hair.  The problem with me, I guess, is that I'm more masculine than I'm feminine.  I'm like a tomboy.  I hang out with the guys.  I don't hang out with girls because they come all that bullsh** on my man and all that.  Hey, hey, hold on.  Watch out, man.  Sorry, sorry.  Do you fight, you put Vaseline and take up Vaseline on your face?  No, no, no, forget it, girls.  When they fight, they grab each other's hair.  Me, I just go straight B with the fist.  Yeah, because I saw a fight yesterday and all they did was held their hair.  You know what I'm saying?  If she didn't have that yaki in there, well, yaki is like horses, right? 
[02:30:00]  If she didn't have that yaki in there, that yaki.  I'm fighting a girl grab my hair and just eat her food.  You going what?  You going what?  What?  Eat her food.  Stab her.  You going to stab her?  Yep.  Wait, wait, wait.  Eat her food?  Hold on.  Slow down.  We learned something.  What did you say, Ebony?  Stabbing her.  That's old.  Eat her food?  Yeah, that's old.  Eat her food.  Slice her face.  That's old.  Oh, jeez.  I never heard of it.  Eat her food, Anthony.  It's new to Whitey.  It's new to me, too. 
[02:30:30]  That's a very good friend.  Hey, yo, check it out.  Hey, I need some of those wild sounds because I want to change the WIC signs from my neighborhood  into wild.  The WIC signs?  Yeah.  I'm trying to convert anybody from WIC to wild.  Wait, Ebony's going to say something.  That won't last in the hood.  What won't last in the hood?  Because right next to the precinct, you've seen the cops put a little wild stickers around  and they just snap another sticker on top of that one.  Oh, really?  Yeah, because I be in the Bronx a lot.  My mom's live right in 138.  I think everyone knows they're and I are very cop friendly. 
[02:31:00]  Yeah.  Right?  Like, I be next to the 40th precinct.  You see mad cops cars with a wild sticker right on the hood.  Yeah.  Right there.  But, like, when they, like, put, I think it was one time, it was like a big sign.  If I may say, the cops is my niggas.  Y'all niggas, not ours.  Anyway, like I was saying.  Wow.  It was like a wild sticker, like, big, right on the wall.  And they slap another sticker on it.  Oh, yeah?  Yeah.  It don't last.  Ebony, do you know Mongoose?  What the hell is that? 
[02:31:30]  Mongoose sells the crack.  Oh, Mongo.  Oh, Mongo.  Hello?  Mongo in Newark.  Oh, he sells the crack.  He sells the crack.  In Newark.  We met him yesterday.  Yeah, hello?  I don't even know how to do it.  Yeah, what happened?  What's up?  You're there, Joe.  All right, yeah.  Oh, now, let me ask you something, right?  Yeah.  Hey, I'm out.  I'm trying to get this.  All right, Ebony.  I'm out.  It's going to be quick.  I'm trying to get this.  You ask us whatever you want.  In Newark, they got this guns for cash program, right?  And they say no questions asked.  If we can get all the listeners to give me like a whole bunch of guns, like a box, I'll  walk in there myself with it and see if they block me up or if they're going to give me 
[02:32:00]  the cash, I mean, like a whole box.  They say no questions asked.  I'll do it.  You know what I mean?  I'll go in there.  I want to see the look in their faces when I walk in there with a bunch of tech nines  and you know what I'm saying?  I think you better stay away from guns, Joe.  Hey, Joe, as they say in the hood, snow down.  Snow down.  The commercials say no questions asked, cash.  Yeah.  So you want us to have a little fundraiser and get everyone to give their guns to us? 
[02:32:30]  Yeah, they don't have to be no real expensive.  We'll put them in a big box and you're going to walk into the prison.  Yeah, I want to see if they got enough money in there to pay me.  With a box, fill them with firearms.  I'll make the money back to the station.  Yeah.  That's hilarious, man.  Or even my bell if they'd lock me up.  Oh, but you know who this is?  I just recognized the voice.  Huh?  It's Jason Williams.  He just wants the guns because he wants the guns.  I got caught with a .357 before with a scope on it and he asked me if I thought I was  a Terminator.  Put it in my stomach. 
[02:33:00]  What the hell can you do with a scope on a .357?  Oh, it was beautiful.  It was nickel-plated with a big scope on it, long.  You're watching too many movies, man.  I'm not watching no movies.  I could mail you my rap sheet.  You got a fax machine?  As a matter of fact, I got off parole in May and the date I got off parole, that's when  I went clean.  You know what?  If we give you a fax number, could you fax us your rap sheet?  Yes, I will.  And we'll read it on the air.  Hold on.  Rick, get his info.  And leave a number so we can call you back.  It's just between us and you, all right?  Don't hang up yet, Joe. 
[02:33:30]  Hold on.  That will be hilarious.  I want to hear that.  Wow.  First of all, I just want to explain to people what that was.  That was Opie and Anthony's tribute to Black History Month here.  The month of February, just about over, but we figured it was time to really get into  the mood.  Share the love between the white man and the black man.  Because I do believe that is exactly things that maybe Martin Luther King was all about.  Holy Jesus Palomino.  Eat her food?  I eat her food.  That means you stab her?  You stab her. 
[02:34:00]  You cut her face, Opie.  Cut her face.  Eat her food.  What else we learned there?  Eat her food was good.  I learned that I am even more petrified than I originally was.  Wow.  That's something.  See if you can teach them a few new words.  Like English.  I understand what they were saying.  Yo, man.  Then I picked up a plasma rifle in a 40-watt range.  Yeah.  Nothing you can imagine has prepared you for this. 
[02:34:30]  I don't want them enjoying it like exactly.  Sometimes you want to hear...  Why?  The Opian Anthony Show.  And E.W.  We got to talk to Spaz and Stinky here, Anthony.  You want to explain what the hell went on yesterday?  Oh, you want me to set it up as Spaz? 
[02:35:00]  Yeah, that's why I think it would be pretty funny if you set it up now, because that's  kind of like what Spaz does on this tape playing me.  Well, the BBC over there in England wanted to link up with us, do a little segment with  Opian Anthony.  We're getting a lot of attention because of today's show, Wowing.  Yes.  So I guess it's their version of some wacky show over there.  Yeah.  The BBC came calling.  Yes.  So we decided instead of going on and talking about England with them and what we're doing, 
[02:35:30]  blah, blah, blah, that we would have Spaz impersonate Opi and Stinky impersonate Anthony  as the new Opian Anthony.  Right.  And they will do the interview.  See, this was a big deal for the station.  They were all excited that you and I were going to be live over there in England on the  BBC.  Yeah.  Yeah, whatever.  Let Spaz and Stinky do it.  Yeah, let them do it.  So they really came through.  Yeah.  Did the job as Opian Anthony.  And I guess this show over there in England, very excited, talked to us. 
[02:36:00]  I guess they've heard a lot about us and they couldn't wait to link up.  You know, I thought we must be doing something over here because I really thought they were  a lot more open over in England to certain things, but we were freaking them out.  Well, Spaz and Stinky as Opian Anthony were freaking them out with some of the stuff  they were saying.  Yes.  Like, uh-oh, we can't say that.  You know, and they were kind of surprised.  Yeah.  I thought you could say anything on the radio over there.  And they were playing along, you know, the guys over there in England, and then they  realized, wow, these guys aren't that funny. 
[02:36:30]  These guys suck.  They're just plain rude.  Yeah.  And I think they wanted to do like 20 minutes with us.  After like five or six minutes, they're trying to get off the telly.  Okay.  All right, then.  I think we're done.  So in case you missed it from yesterday, it's Spaz and Stinky as Opian Anthony talking  to the BBC, Anthony.  Yes.  If you need me to stop the tape, just let me know, okay?  Here it is.  It's the O&A Show. 
[02:37:00]  Yes, everybody.  Smashing pumpkins in the background.  Rocking, man.  Well, Anthony, we got BBC on the line.  And they got an exclusive interview based on the wow thing that we did on the Today Show.  Okay.  Coming up later on the show with Jonathan.  With Susie showing her boobs live on the Today Show.  And I want to give a quick recap before we get to the interview.  Well, for the past few months, we've been telling people that we're going to give any  woman that flashes a Today Show $1,000 out of her own pocket. 
[02:37:30]  $1,000, Anthony.  So one day, we didn't even realize this.  We got emails and a woman had showed her breasts on TV.  And today, we got the BBC show, I'm sorry, live in London.  Dominic Diamond, I believe.  Are you guys out there?  How's it going in London?  Hang on, we've got to fade you up here first.  One moment.  I said pencils.  Pencils.  I said pencils as well.  There you go.  Great debate tonight.  Pens or pencils?  Pencils by a landslide. 
[02:38:00]  Yeah, well, you can give people that poison.  How's it going out there?  Are you hearing us?  Hey!  I think I can hear Anthony and Opie from the yacht there.  Good afternoon, guys.  That's right.  Opie and Anthony, live in New York.  On 102.7 WNEW.  That's right.  How's it going there in London?  Yes, we're fine.  We're fine and dandy, guys.  Listen, you guys have hit the news yourself this week, haven't you?  With this W.O.W.  Wow.  Yes, Whipping Mount Wendy's.  It's a promotion here in New York.  And basically, we encourage men to put wow in their cars.  And women to flash their breasts. 
[02:38:30]  Any guy to see in the car with their wow sign?  That is fantastic.  Wait a minute.  I'm lucky if I...  What was that description of wow?  Hey, everybody see why they're in the car?  It's wow.  It's fine.  What kind of explanation was that?  But so far, they're doing a good job, Anthony.  So far, they're doing a good job.  Let me hear that, though, again, because...  He called me out.  Hey, him.  I want to hear how he explains wow.  He didn't even say Wednesday.  Yeah.  Wednesday, Wednesday.  I thought he did a great job.  All right.  Here it is.  All right.  How's it going there in London?  Yes, we're fine. 
[02:39:00]  We're fine and dandy, guys.  Listen, you guys have hit the news yourself this week, aren't you?  We're going to hear this with this W-O-W, wow.  Yes.  Yes, Whip-Em-Out Wendy's.  It's a promotion here in New York, and basically, we encourage men to put wow in their cars,  and women to flash their breasts.  Any guy to see in the car with their wow sign?  What?  What is that?  And women who flash...  I need that verbatim, so I can say it.  And women who flash their breasts on the car with the wow sign.  What?  They understood perfectly, though.  Oh, please.  Speak up. 
[02:39:30]  And you're with this W-O-W, wow.  Yes.  Whip-Em-Out Wendy's.  It's a promotion here in New York, and basically, we encourage men to put wow in their cars,  and women to flash their breasts.  Any guy to see in the car with their wow sign?  I don't understand that.  It's like another language.  I can't even say it again.  It's so out there.  But they understood that's the best part.  They didn't even question it.  At that point, they're like, oh, my goodness, they're re-talks. 
[02:40:00]  I mean, Anthony, re-talks.  Smoking that wacky tobacco before they talked to us.  Wendy, Wendy, Wendy, Wendy, day, day, day.  Just wait to the part where Spaz and Stinky sound like Beavis and Butthead as they're just  saying, uh, England, England sucks.  England blows.  It's coming up.  Here we go.  That is fantastic, because over here, I'm lucky if I can get Chicken Choking Tuesday.  Ho, ho, ho.  You hear Stinky?  Stinky doing a ho, ho, ho. 
[02:40:30]  Like laughing at his little humorous thing there with a Chicken Choking Tuesday.  His attempt at humor.  It's meant to put wow in their cars, and women to flash their breasts.  Any guy to see in the car with their wow sign?  That's fantastic, because over here, I'm lucky if I can get Chicken Choking Tuesday.  Ho, ho, ho.  But, of course, every day is a Wednesday for us over here.  Now, how did you manage to get into trouble for it, man?  What happened?  What's the beef?  Uh, well, I don't think there really is any beef about it. 
[02:41:00]  It's just that here in America, unlike in London, where it's much more freer there.  Right, Anthony?  Yes.  There's, uh, there's not as many breasts around and stuff like in London, so...  Wait a minute, Stinky.  Stinky, what the hell?  You're representing me here to the world.  Right.  The world thinks that you are Anthony, and there's not as many breasts around?  Well, what I meant to say is, like, in newspapers and magazines and stuff.  Well, you should have made yourself a little more clear. 
[02:41:30]  Did it come out now?  Thank God you didn't.  You've got to explain it.  Oh, ho.  All right, here we go.  Yes, there's, uh, there's not as many breasts around and stuff like in London, so...  Right.  And people are very upset about it.  And you're not really allowed to show, uh, bare nudity here in America like you are here.  Bare nudity as opposed to clothes and nudity.  Uh, no.  Bare nudity, O.P.  I didn't even catch half of this yesterday.  You're not allowed to show bare nudity as opposed to that clothed nudity. 
[02:42:00]  Don't be bare nudity.  Bare nudity or maybe, uh, ostrich nudity or other animals that want to be nudity.  But they're still with us.  They have no clue.  We're putting them on.  No.  They're not allowed to show, uh, bare nudity here in America like you are in Europe.  Can you show one breast?  Uh, no.  I, they're, they're very strict here in America.  Okay.  Okay.  But, so, but someone, someone got, okay, hold on, hold on.  Right now, right, I can tell you what's happening in the guys from England minds right now. 
[02:42:30]  Yeah.  They are going, oh no.  Oh no, we, we made an awful mistake.  This is horrible.  Uh, these two don't know anything.  They're a couple of effing retards.  And now we are stuck with them to do an interview.  We are totally stuck.  What do we do?  They're kind of, they're starting to get bombed.  You can hear because they kind of went like, ha, ha, ha.  Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.  Now I got to go back to the ship and get another match. 
[02:43:00]  All right, here it is.  Uh, no.  They're very strict here in America.  Okay.  Okay.  All right.  Oh no.  All right, the tide has changed.  Yeah, they know they're in trouble.  They're like, uh-oh, this isn't working out.  But, so, but someone, someone got them out on telly on behalf of you guys?  Yes, someone did. Basically, we offered a $1,000 bounty about two years ago for any woman who could show their breasts live on television. 
[02:43:30]  And lo and behold, one of our listeners decided to show their breasts on TV.  That's commitment.  Long commitment. I can't believe they remembered it after two years.  This is someone who will not be taken apart in Whip'em Out Wednesday is our Queen Mother, who was 100 years old.  All right, now he's trying to change the subject. He realizes, all right, I'm getting nothing with this Whip'em Eight Wednesday thing with these two retards, Opie and Anthony, from New York.  So I really better change the subject. Maybe they have a little riff on the Queen Mum. 
[02:44:00]  The Queen Mum.  Wow.  This week, did you guys see any of the big parades? Were you guys interested in that over there?  No, not really. No one really cares about the Queen over here in America.  Definitely wouldn't want to see her breasts.  There was some DJ over here who got into trouble because she said the Queen Mother smelled of wee.  No, this is true. One of our most popular DJs, of course, is not true because she smells of Calvin Klein's obsession.  I know she bathes in that regular. 
[02:44:30]  Other royal stuff, Buckingham Palace have evidently warned Britney Spears to stop pestering Prince William.  Really?  Well, was that like a joke?  She bathes in obsession?  Yeah, there was a joke in there somewhere.  Like he was throwing that quick, boy, it sure isn't Benny Hill when you don't have pictures, you know?  Right.  It certainly isn't.  And maybe the Queen Mum does smell like wee.  All right, here we go.  One of our most popular DJs, of course, is not true because she smells of Calvin Klein's obsession.  I know she bathes in that regular.  Other royal stuff, Buckingham Palace have evidently warned Britney Spears to stop pestering Prince William. 
[02:45:00]  Really?  Well, would the prince be getting banged?  No, but I will be banged right into the tower straight after this.  Do you think Britney Spears is possibly a stalker for our own Prince William?  Britney's a little whore.  Oh!  Okay.  There is the first of Anthony's, a.k.a. Stinky's, impressions.  Because we told him, now, you know, throw some impressions in there because you're Anthony. 
[02:45:30]  So he, I guess, was doing a dice.  It sounds like he just said Britney's a whore and then a safe fell on his foot or something.  He just kind of screams.  Oh!  Anthony's showing off his impressions to the entire world with that one.  But Spaz getting a laugh from the England guys.  Did you notice that?  Yeah, I did.  Talking about Prince William getting banged?  All right, listen to Stinky doing the dice, though.  Straight after this.  Do you think Britney Spears is possibly a stalker for our own Prince William? 
[02:46:00]  Britney's a little whore.  Oh!  He must be a fag.  I would like to say at this point that Britney Spears is not here to defend herself against  a whore in a sorrow, otherwise, than Prince William.  He's certainly not a fag.  Not that there'd be anything normal with Prince William being a fag if he was.  Listen to how, Steve, this is the problem they have over there.  We're thinking like it's England and they're very open and liberal and they can say what they  want on the BBC.  See, he covered three bases right there.  He covered the fact that Britney Spears isn't a whore and she's not here to defend herself 
[02:46:30]  against someone calling her whore.  Prince William is not gay.  But if he was, there certainly wouldn't be a problem with him.  Could this guy backpedal about anything else?  I gotta hear that again.  You guys, just the outrageous Opie and Anthony calling over to England.  Unbelievable.  Britney's a little whore.  He must be a fag.  I would like to say at this point that Britney Spears is not here to defend herself against  a whore and a star otherwise than Prince William. 
[02:47:00]  He's certainly not a fag.  Not that there'd be anything wrong with Prince William being a fag if he was.  Well, you heard Anthony doing an impression of Andrew Dice Clay.  I'm not sure if you heard of him in London.  I wrote part of my thesis on Andrew Dice Clay.  Really?  I was at university on the comedy of him and Sam Kinison and all those guys.  Well, actually, we have Tom Brokaw in the studio.  And Tom Brokaw, would you like to say anything to BBC?  Oh, he is.  Britney is very hot and I think William is gay. 
[02:47:30]  Gay is happy, yeah.  Gay is happy.  Actually, Tom Brokaw, he's like a newscaster over there, yeah?  Yes, he is.  Tom Brokaw's a bit...  What a clusterf.  What a clusterf that is.  That has got to be the worst Tom Brokaw.  It's like Darth Brokaw.  At this point, you've got to think the guys are sweating over there.  Yeah, they're just like, oh my God, these guys, obviously, I don't understand how they're  doing so well in New York.  I've got to hear that again.  I've got to hear that again. 
[02:48:00]  What a train wreck.  Just say anything to BBC.  Oh, yes.  Britney is very hot and I think William is gay.  Gay is happy, yeah.  Gay is happy.  Actually, Tom Brokaw, he's like a newscaster over there, yeah?  Yes, he is.  Tom Brokaw's a...  He's like a McDonald's.  I do the NBC nightly news.  Actually, Anthony does many impressions.  Just name any character and Anthony can do it for you.  Yoda.  Yoda. 
[02:48:30]  Ooh.  Yes, I will.  That's not a bad Yoda.  Wow, look at that.  It wasn't him, though.  Who was it?  The BBC guy jumped in.  Oh, it was?  Everyone thought it was stinky.  He jumped in and did the rest of the Yoda impression.  And Anthony can do it for you.  Yoda.  Yoda.  Oh, uh...  Yes, I will.  Do that that I do not know.  On this day when his great mate Alec Guinness has passed away.  Yes, it's very...  We are very saddened by the news of Alec Guinness. 
[02:49:00]  Very great in Star Wars.  It was the most popular...  I believe it's the most popular feature-leg film.  Yes.  I think Alec Guinness is gay, too.  It is now totally coming apart at the seams.  The guys in England just freaking out right now.  What do we do?  Oh, my God.  What do we do?  This thing he's saying, oh, Guinness is gay, too.  Jesus.  Here we go.  You can't say that about him.  He's a knight.  Did he suck on fags? 
[02:49:30]  No, I don't think he did at any point.  You know, sometimes it's hard to understand your voice.  I mean, are you sucking on a fag right now?  No, I'm not.  I gave up smoking when my child was born.  Well, I used to have a fag in the morning.  Oh, no.  Jonathan the Post-Mesherboy did not encourage these guys.  I actually heard when Alec Guinness died, he also smelled like wee.  No, I don't think he did.  I think he smelled of wisdom.  And on that box, we have to say thank you very much to Opie and Anthony for it.  Punch out.  Punch out.  Five, ten minutes. 
[02:50:00]  Jonathan the Post-Mesherboy, very, very enlightening.  Thank you very much indeed.  Like my career.  Well, we've got Regis in the studio.  Listen, guys, I don't need you guys to help me screw up my own show.  I can do it perfectly well on my own.  Opie and Anthony in New York.  Screw up his job.  They've obviously got a bit more relaxed and liberal radio views than us at the BBC, which  is a pity.  So, well done, Jonathan the Post-Mesherboy.  Thank you.  We're sorting him out this week.  England sucks.  Okay, this is the all-new Dominant Diamond Radio.  No, I know how I get away with this.  This is Ian Payne in the afternoon.  This is Radio 5 Live. 
[02:50:30]  Do you understand that the BBC is like, there's not many radio stations over there.  Like, that was probably being listened to by all of England.  And you were representing the Opie and Anthony show here in New York.  And there's probably still people that woke up this morning and went, oh, my God, that  Opie and Anthony are horrible.  I can't believe it.  That was the most horrible, horrible crap I've ever had. 
[02:51:00]  I thought it was hilarious, man.  Jesus, you too.  That was great.  Bravo.  It really was great.  We're going to have to pull that little ruse again, I'm sure.  Rob from Brooklyn.  Stinky's Dice sounds more like Macho Randy Savage.  Macho man.  Woo!  Ronnie, what's going on?  Hey, O&A.  How are you doing?  Doing well.  Good.  I thought the general consensus was that English people are fairly intelligent.  Yeah.  Are you sure that they didn't replace their two best jocks with the two idiots from their 
[02:51:30]  shows so they don't be on an equal playing field?  We were thinking that, too, but obviously they didn't because they were very serious about  things.  They were covering all their bases when the Opie and Anthony show were being very rude on  their airwaves about England, saying England sucks.  Well, according to Spaz, you guys should change Whip-Em-Out-Wedney to Whip-Em-Out-Wedney.  Whip-Em-Out-Wedney.  And when you put your well on the cars and the people that see the thing on the thing, women. 
[02:52:00]  I think just for fun, you should have them recite the days of the week.  Let's just see if you can say them all.  Whip-Wedney.  Whip-Wedney.  You guys take care.  You're the best.  Thank you, Ronnie.  Stinky sounds like dice with Tourette's.  Yeah, the dice one was great.  Woo!  Woo!  Well, that was fun.  Yeah, that was very good, guys.  We'll have to do that again.  Bravo.  Spaz coming right to the table.  Taking the initiative.  And Stinky right there.  With the impressions that Tom broke off. 
[02:52:30]  I would listen to you guys every day, man.  Woo!  Tom broke off.  The best part is when the host over there realized, oh, my God, this just sucks.  Yeah, oh, my God, what did we do?  What happened?  This was supposed to be an exclusive with Opie and Anthony in New York.  And it sucks.  And it's falling apart so quickly.  And then they're bad-mouthing Sir Alec Guinness.  The day he dies.  The Queen Mum.  The Queen Mum.  Calling Prince William a fag.  Young William a fag. 
[02:53:00]  Young William.  You're right, though.  They covered all their bases.  Yeah.  We're pretty scared there.  The barber liked Stinky's ant impression coming out of the song.  Rockin' out.  He said, like, yeah, rockin' out.  Yeah.  That's good.  Stinky did a great job.  He hasn't done much radio.  I mean, it's hilarious, man.  I think Spaz was talking over him.  Yeah, next time, we're going to have to give Stinky more air time.  Yeah.  For his impressions and stuff. 
[02:53:30]  For his impressions.  The frickin' dice.  Ooh.  Ooh, yeah.  He can do anyone.  He does the Tom Brokaw.  And they have no clue.  Snap into a Slim Jim.  Stink.  Do Macho Man.  Snap into a Slim Jim.  All right.  What you have to do is, you have to tell them to do dice, which would be the Macho Man impression.  Right.  Do dice. 
[02:54:00]  Snap into a Slim Jim.  Ooh.  Macho Man dice clay.  All right.  We'll take a break.  We'll be back.  We'll be back. </pre>
