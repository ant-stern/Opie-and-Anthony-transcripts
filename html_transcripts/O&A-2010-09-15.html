<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show opened with a segment focused on a listener's tweet suggesting co-host Fez might have MRSA.  The hosts initially joked about it, but the discussion quickly turned graphic as they described MRSA boils and their potential severity.  Extensive speculation ensued, fueled by calls to E-Rock, a pharmacist, and ultimately Dr. Steve, a medical professional, who explained MRSA and abscesses.  Listeners shared their own staph infection experiences.  Fez called in, confirming a large, painful boil under his arm and reluctantly agreeing to see a doctor.  The segment concluded with jokes and speculation about Fez's condition and the studio's subsequent hazmat-suit-and-industrial-strength-disinfectant deep clean.

Next, the show transitioned to a discussion of *America's Got Talent*, featuring highly offensive commentary about Prince Poppycock, a young opera singer, Defining Gravity, and Piers Morgan's judging.  The hosts also insulted several public figures, including Chelsea Handler (and her VMAs performance), Lady Gaga, and Perez Hilton.  They discussed Mayor Bloomberg's proposed smoking ban, touching on government revenue and individual freedoms, all peppered with offensive language.  Callers contributed their opinions on *America's Got Talent* and other topics.  Billy Burr's upcoming appearance was announced.

The show then shifted to a discussion about excessive children's homework, its perceived uselessness, and the stress it caused.  The hosts and callers debated traditional schooling versus alternative paths, referencing Bill Gates and Steve Jobs.  They criticized the perceived political correctness and sanitization in schools, citing the removal of traditional holidays.  A caller shared a story about a teacher warning against invention scams.  The discussion veered into inventions and infomercials.  Bill Burr joined in studio, agreeing with the hosts' criticisms of the education system and advocating for community college.  The segment included "Ira the Weatherman" reading 50 Cent's tweets and a discussion of a video showing a child being startled awake with an air horn.

Bill Burr remained in studio as Mark Maron joined later.  The conversation began with a discussion about the relative danger of large animals, sparked by *Cannonball Run Part 2*.  Ira again read 50 Cent's tweets, and a bit followed about Rob Bartlett's lateness affecting their D.C. broadcast. The hosts imitated Imus's reaction.  Maron discussed his relationship with his 27-year-old girlfriend, his anger issues, and the self-help book he was reading.  The hosts, Burr, and Maron analyzed different types of anger with crude and sexually explicit commentary.  Maron detailed his chaotic relationship, anxieties about air travel, and experiences with racial profiling, often using vulgar and offensive language.

A subsequent segment focused heavily on Maron's tumultuous relationship, including physical altercations and his girlfriend's confession of a past sexual encounter with a mutual acquaintance.  Maron discussed his own infidelities, including a threesome.  He detailed the complexities of his relationship, his self-destructive patterns, and the challenges of emotional intimacy.  He also discussed his podcast, "WTF," and his interviews with various comedians, including Patrice O'Neal, Dane Cook, Judd Apatow, and Carlos Mencia.  He recounted a humorous anecdote about mishandling a prop gun on a film set with Bill Burr, Ray Liotta, Steve Carell, and Tina Fey.  The segment concluded with promotional mentions of Maron's upcoming shows and podcast.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  Shut up!  Get us back to the funny.  But first, let's play this.  People understand we don't belong on radio, right?  Satellite radio douchebags?  I take that as like a compliment.  Yes, we suck a dick.  Sorry to everybody out there.  This is fucking satellite fuck dick radio. 
[00:00:30]  Holy shit.  What a great show.  We heard you.  I don't want to make everyone feel bad,  but you know this is what old people sit around and do.  Pity porn, semen squirting, and shoot up the job.  Oh, what the fuck?  This morning has been, I feel like I'm on Jerry Springer.  Enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road.  Let's do it.  Everyone breathe in.  Breathe in.  What do you smell? 
[00:01:00]  Breathe out.  I smell disinfectant and what appears to be a very clean studio.  Nothing but cleanliness.  I'm looking around at a keyboard that I use on a daily basis, computer keyboard.  That is spotless.  It's immaculate in here.  And my sound effect-y machine.  Yeah, keep going.  Computer monitors.  Keep going.  The dump button panel.  The mouse. 
[00:01:30]  The mic stand.  The microphone.  Smell the microphone.  Oh, I know.  The entire console.  I cannot tell you the armrests of the chairs.  Did you see the rugs?  The rugs.  Did you see the walls?  Everything.  The walls.  Did you see the ceiling?  Did you see the glass?  I have never seen a cleaner studio than I am looking at sitting here right now.  Amazing.  We have extraordinary powers, Opie, Anthony, and Jim Norton. 
[00:02:00]  Extraordinary.  We really need to use our powers for good instead of making people jump through hoops based  on something I heard.  Why?  What do you mean?  Well, the company basically cleaned the studio all night long pretty much using hazmat suits.  Mars, you got some of the emails.  What did they end up doing in here?  They shampooed the rugs. 
[00:02:30]  What else?  They shampooed the rugs?  Yes.  Yes.  I don't play.  They disinfected everything that you can possibly touch in this room.  Yeah.  They shampooed the rugs.  I believe they cleaned the walls as well.  Why?  Everything.  Opie has that.  He has the why.  I got emails and everything, man.  And the why is the funniest part.  I was taken very seriously yesterday.  Well, I got a tweet.  A tweet. 
[00:03:00]  This is all because of a tweet.  Yeah.  I got a tweet from somebody that said, how do you feel that Fezzy might have MRSA?  Yeah.  Yeah.  The fuck is MRSA?  You don't want MRSA.  That's one of those infectious.  We've done the MRSA show.  Boil thing.  It's not fun.  It's some kind of like, I don't know, some kind of virus that's in you.  And then the virus decides it really needs to get out of your fucking body.  So it bores a hole from wherever it is until it finds air. 
[00:03:30]  Destroying everything in its path, basically.  It's an infection.  Yes.  It is pretty much an infection.  But it's an infection that moves outward.  Yeah, yeah.  So if there's something really important in the way, it's going to fuck you up.  Yeah, and it makes these wonderful holes in it.  Is that the thing Bill Schultz had?  I think so.  Oh, probably.  Even though he said it was a boil or something.  Oh, that was horrible.  Yeah, and that looked more like MRSA than anything else.  I hate the word MRSA already.  I don't like it.  So this guy, he tweets me. 
[00:04:00]  He goes, how do you feel that Fezzy might have MRSA?  So then I get fat E-Rock involved.  Why don't you just say I got blue sky or white clouds?  And, you know, E-Rock could use a case of MRSA and knock a few LBs off it, the MRSA coming out of his body.  I go, hey, does Fezzy have MRSA?  He goes, I don't know.  What did he write?  He goes, I don't know.  I go, well, fucking find out. 
[00:04:30]  Oh, wait.  Let me.  Oh, I deleted his chat for some reason.  Because then he's bitching about something else that has to do with the company.  I'm like, I don't give a shit about what you're hearing with your ear to the ground.  Find out if Fezzy has MRSA.  Was he gossiping?  Yes, he was.  He's always gossiping.  Hey, here's Scott Shannon.  It's always about some radio personality you don't give a shit about.  It's unbelievable.  He really is a gossip.  Oh, you get the radio gossip from E-Rock?  It's the worst.  But yet it is very interesting when you're listening.  And then it's when you're walking away, you're going, what the fuck was that about? 
[00:05:00]  Yeah, why?  Why?  I hear Scott Shannon's leaving radio in the year 2015.  Well, great, E-Rock.  Thank you.  A, that may be true.  Who the fuck?  And who gives a fuck?  Right.  So you want to take calls from, look, they're already out there, man.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  Pharmacists can give Jimmy a little info on MRSA.  Isn't it spelled M-R-S-A for the people that want to Google it?  M-R?  I think so.  Isn't it an acronym?  I think it's an acronym, but they go with, yeah, they just say MRSA now. 
[00:05:30]  And it's M-R-S-A, I believe.  Acronym, that's in Ohio.  Oh, no, it's not.  Google image MRSA.  You'll have a lot of fun with what pops up.  Jesus Christ.  Mike in Delaware.  Mike.  Hey, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus.  Yes.  So, in other words, what it means is these bacteria don't respond to any kind of penicillin  or penicillin-like drugs, which is really bad frickin' news, because, you know, that's 
[00:06:00]  most of what we use.  And then, so what they, the drugs they have to use is something called vancomycin, which  you really don't want to take unless you're dying.  Why not?  What's it do to you?  Well, it can, it can, it can, it has a lot of side effects.  One, it can affect your hearing.  It can also affect your kidneys.  Your kidneys, great, yeah.  Yeah, MRSA, wait for how long, though?  How long do you take it for?  Oh, you know, it's, it's variable.  Oh, God.  And it's an IV, it's an IV drug, so you're, you know, you're pretty much in a hospital. 
[00:06:30]  Jesus, Danny.  Yeah, MRSA's no joke.  Let's see the face guy.  Holy shit.  Yeah, that's a guy with MRSA.  He's got MRSA face.  Aw.  So, if, if someone tweets me that Fezzy might have MRSA, I take it very seriously.  I don't even know.  I don't even know if it was a bit.  I don't even care.  I pretty much took, um, a tweet, which, if you've noticed, the record of the, uh, listener  tweets accuracy.  That was the only information you had?  Yes.  Oh, yeah.  On, on anything.  The listeners fucking, oh my God, the MRSA baby face looks like the baby from fucking Eraser. 
[00:07:00]  Uh, it, it, the listeners, as far as their accuracy on Twitters go.  Right.  Is zero percent.  It's zero.  They've never been right.  Uh, but Opie took this to heart and said, uh.  Of course it is.  That's it.  Because.  Where's E-Rock?  Why would E-Rock come down in the hall when he's part of the MRSA discussion?  Well, I was listening to Ron and Fez on the way home.  Oh, so you got some info on this.  I heard, uh, when, when Fez was in here and Ronnie was talking about this boil that Fez 
[00:07:30]  has.  See, boil, MRSA.  I don't know where it is, but, but, uh.  That's, that's the MRSA because it's starting to come out of the body.  Fez said it started off as a little thing.  And then within a couple of days, it was a big boil.  And he called the doctor and told the doctor.  And the doctor said, uh, well, I think I should see you, you know, as soon as possible, which  turns out to be Wednesday.  What's wrong with Fez?  If you have MRSA, you gotta check that shit out right away.  Immediately.  Immediately.  You go to the fucking emergency room. 
[00:08:00]  You don't fuck around with MRSA.  Yeah.  So to see him immediately means Wednesday, meaning today.  The, uh, virus.  So that means these fuckers are gonna have to clean the studio again, uh, tonight.  Apparently there is.  Because I'm not coming in until Fez is cleared of MRSA.  I'm telling you right now.  Apparently there's a, oh, here it is.  Video.  Boil or infection filled solid with pus.  Underneath my arm.  Help!  Uh.  Help!  Oh! 
[00:08:30]  Help!  Oh!  Uh.  When is, when is Fez going to show the boil?  Ha ha ha ha ha ha.  That's the boil.  Uh-huh.  It's under his arm.  Yeah.  Um.  All right.  So this isn't a bit.  There's something going on.  It could be.  What could it be?  Being grown hair?  That gets that big?  Or do you, like, some people are allergic to, um, like certain types of, uh, aluminum chlorhydrate  in the deodorant. 
[00:09:00]  Right.  If you use, like, a roll-on or some type of a dry deodorant or something.  Um.  So who, who knows?  Yeah.  But that does look kind of, um.  It's horrible.  Yeah.  Of course.  That's the worst thing I've ever seen.  Of course.  It was growing another tit.  Where's E-Rock?  I thought we were looking at him.  I don't know.  So E-Rock, I wrote you yesterday.  Mercer boil you.  Walk us through this.  What did I write you before you had to give me all the other fucking rumors that are going on?  Uh.  You wrote me, hey, does Fez have Mercer?  Uh, and I said, I don't know. 
[00:09:30]  I wasn't listening to their show.  And you go, we'll find out, like, in all capital letters.  Yeah, I go, we'll find out.  So I talked with Pepper, and I asked, uh, you know, what he knew about this.  He said, they were talking about Fez's boil, and I guess somebody called in and said, that's  a possibility.  You should have that checked out.  Right.  Oh.  That looks not good, man.  Ah.  Where, where could the people see the fucking, uh, Fez thing?  In their nightmares?  In their nightmares, yes. 
[00:10:00]  No kidding.  What, if you follow 202Friends on Twitter?  Yes, 202Friends.  202Friends on Twitter has, uh, the video linked.  Oh.  And, uh, so then, did you talk to Blatt or anybody else?  No.  You were the only one who, uh, who was actually concerned about this.  Well, someone had to be concerned about this.  Oh, God, they zoomed right up on it.  Yeah.  I can't look.  Would you kiss it?  No.  Oh.  So, then, uh, then I got our, our agent involved, and, and he's. 
[00:10:30]  Are you kidding?  He's, he did a Wikipedia on Mercer so I could read up on it.  I'm like, I already know what this is.  I've, I've known people that have gotten this.  In the end, they were fine, but it's, it's a fucking highly contagious thing that is dangerous  as all hell.  Well, uh, apparently they're using it to pick football games.  Oh, really?  Yes.  What, is he squeezing shit out anywhere?  I don't know.  He, he said he was thinking about squeezing it. 
[00:11:00]  Right.  But, um, got a little gun shy there.  Mm-hmm.  Well, uh.  Staphylococcus.  Uh, well, so I get, I got an email back from one of the guys down the hall.  He goes, I spoke with Fez.  He's got a growth under his arm that will be looked at by a doctor tomorrow.  Mercer was one of the handful of jokes on the show about the growth.  From what we've read, all of a sudden they've decided they're experts on fucking medical  shit.  Serious doctors.  Yeah.  From what we've read, Mercer is transmitted through skin contact and in hospitals. 
[00:11:30]  Gary has assured me that the studio will be, uh, you know, sanitized.  Dr. Gary?  Yeah, exactly.  One of the babysitters is now a doctor.  Dr. Gary has assured us?  Yeah, he's assured me, the other guy, that the studio will be disinfected, so when you  guys get in there, you'll be fine.  Are they going to come in in scrubs with stethoscopes?  Right.  So what do you think I wrote, Ed?  Um, I'm sure.  Knowing me for a while.  Thank you very much.  Right.  Um, I'll see you tomorrow. 
[00:12:00]  Right.  I wrote, Mercer is connected to hospitals, yes, but then is transmitted easily after that  person leaves the hospital.  Highly contagious and very dangerous.  And then I write, is Gary an expert on sanitizing a studio of Mercer?  If not, you need to find someone that is.  Once again, I, I, I knew someone that, uh, got this and they weren't in or anywheres near  a hospital.  This shit is no joke.  Fez should have had this checked out ASAP.  Don't be surprised if I don't show until Fez is determined not to have Mercer. 
[00:12:30]  This is not worth taking a chance over.  Wow.  Dr. Hughes and, uh, Dr. Blatterer are having discussions about Mercer.  Yes, yes.  They're having consultations with each other and I think they're, um, their hypotheses  aren't, uh, they aren't in agreement.  No.  No.  Do you concur?  Dr. Hughes, do you concur with Dr. Blatter?  One guy was on Wikipedia and one guy sort of lived through it.  There's a difference.  Not much though. 
[00:13:00]  There's not a teeny difference.  There's a difference.  And then Bob got involved and he was Wikipedia with Mercer.  What did he say?  He eats Mercer for lunch?  A creep?  A fucking ghoul?  What did he want to, what did he want to represent Mercer?  Tell Mercer to call me.  He thought it was a morning show.  Hepatitis and Mercer in the morning.  Or Bobby Mercer.  The announcer for the Yankees.  Good old Bobby Mercer.  Uh, and then finally, after a lot more email, a lot more emails going back and forth, I 
[00:13:30]  got this late last night.  In addition to the disinfectant foam and antibacterial wipes that engineering is cleaning with, uh,  blah, blah, our head of blah, blah, is having his crew use the highest grade cleaners for  a full studio cleaning tonight.  Good.  Yeah.  And those guys basically just left in their hazmat suits.  They were here all night.  So now we got a spotless studio hoping that we don't get Mercer.  This place is clean, though.  Which mic does Fezzy use?  Mine!  Yeah, it's all over there.  Well, he doesn't talk out of his armpit. 
[00:14:00]  That's where the Mercer is.  Dude, he had his shirt off and he was pointing to it, and then if you get a little on your  fingertip, I don't know where the fucking thing is.  I think it lives on surfaces and shit.  All right.  Well, you're in Mercer's on it.  At least we're okay over here.  There's Clorox wipes over there.  There's Lysol.  We have the Purell all around.  The Cheerios.  The Cheerios.  The milk.  Right.  Food products.  I'm just going to...  But this is all based on a tweet I got, so...  I'm all skeevy about even rubbing my eyes or anything. 
[00:14:30]  Don't touch anything.  I feel like I'm going to get conjunctivite.  Well, that's...  The Mercer of the eyeball.  I hate that.  Oh, big infected eyeball pus coming out.  Well, the Mercer would just eat away your eyeball.  Ow!  Really?  I mean, we should get Dr. Steve on the phone.  He knows about Mercer.  We did this bit with fucking Dr. Steve before.  The pus is basically indicative of the Mercer.  It's fighting to get out, basically.  And the Mercer will rise to the surface.  Oh.  Oh.  You don't want it. 
[00:15:00]  Believe me, gentlemen.  You don't want it.  Save the pus for my next...  Yeah.  I'll like to save the pus, but put it in my wine.  Wine.  Wine.  Mercer label on his wine.  Yeah, you don't want it.  The fluid is really...  You don't pop the fucking cork, you lance the bottle.  Let's go to Steve in Florida State.  Yes!  Hello! 
[00:15:30]  Hey, boys.  How you doing?  Hello.  Good, Steve.  Look, I want to know why.  He says he was able to stay in the studio all day long, but yet Jason Ellis has a small  staph infection, and he's pulled off in the middle of his show and throwing the best  up.  Come on.  Yeah, man.  Was it one way around here?  Look, we're having a little fun with it, and we made these assholes around here jump  through hoops, but the fact is, you got to take Mercer very seriously.  And they're going to have to now clean the studio again after the Ron and Fez show, unless 
[00:16:00]  they get some kind of diagnosis on what the fucking thing is.  Well, he's supposed to be going to the doctor.  Before the show?  I don't know.  Is it before or after the program?  Well, trust me, I'll be following this one up.  What does Jason Ellis have?  He had a staph infection, which is not fun either.  Where's that?  I don't know.  How do you get that from the gym, too, I think, right?  Oh, yeah.  There's an MMA...  Well, there was an MMA guy on the line.  He said he got Mercer once.  It's hanging out in sweaty areas.  We had a staph infection, but they let him go. 
[00:16:30]  I'm kidding.  Come on.  What if we can't goof?  Come on.  Steve knows this show.  But what about some basketball player had it, and he had his foot cut off or something?  Like, he was a young guy, high school guy.  Yeah.  And he just didn't get it treated.  Yeah.  Oh.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Staff infection.  Let me say hi to Blazing Barney in Pennsylvania.  Blazing Barney.  Hey, what's up, boys?  What's up?  Hey.  Hey, I had one of those staph infections there.  It was a boil, a little bit bigger than Fezzi's, but it was right on my crotch. 
[00:17:00]  That thing, it hurt like a son of a bitch, man.  How'd you get it?  My dad ended up, he had a...  Oh, what did your dad do?  Oh, no.  Jesus.  The whole staph breast.  What, he jerked you off while he had some of that on his fingertips?  Fucking whiskers poke you a little bit.  I should have thought that out before.  No kidding, man.  Yeah, you should have.  You walked right into a fucking roundhouse.  He had a heart surgery, and then he ended up getting MRSA from the hospital.  Oh.  And then I took care of him for a couple months. 
[00:17:30]  Next thing you know, I got an infected hair down there.  And it was just annoying at first.  And then it got to be fucking, like, golf ball size to the point where I couldn't walk  or do anything.  Did they cut a nice little X in it to kind of let it get out of you?  Yeah, they did.  They did that.  That's what Bill had.  It almost sounds like it's a creature inside you.  And then they make an X to kind of direct it out of the body.  Ah, fucking A.  Did it destroy your groin?  No, no.  I'm still good.  I'm still good. 
[00:18:00]  You know, I'm a huge fat fuck anyway, so I'm destroyed anyway.  Oh.  Oh, Jesus.  Honest, too.  Hey, you later, guys.  All right, man.  See ya.  Let's go to Dr. Steve.  Ah.  Dr. Steve.  Yeah.  Good morning, boys.  Hey, hi, Dr. Steve.  You're not listening to the show, right?  You probably just woke up?  Yeah, I just woke up.  All right, well, Fezzy has some kind of boil under his arm.  I'm sure you got the phone call from him.  I wouldn't doubt it.  But I made SiriusXM do a major cleanup of this studio, because Merce is no joke, right, sir? 
[00:18:30]  Yes.  Well, it's so common, it's becoming a joke.  But it is, yeah, you don't...  A joke.  You don't want to get it.  Oh, my God.  Yeah.  Take Jimmy's impression of you.  Look at the fluid buildup.  Puss.  Look, you fucking ghoul.  You hang out with doctors that see this shit every day.  We're just average citizens.  We're creeped out by Merce, so help us out here.  What is it?  Do you think Fez has it? 
[00:19:00]  Give us a little background.  Okay.  It's methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus is what MRSA is.  You know, Staphylococcus aureus is a normal skin bug.  People have lived with Staphylococcus aureus on their skin.  For, you know, thousands, if not millions of years.  So, you know, it's a bug that's been around forever.  It used to be that when penicillin was first developed, that when you got a staph infection, 
[00:19:30]  you could treat it with plain old penicillin.  But this fucking bug is very smart and it's sneaky because when it, when, let's just say that you kill,  that you've got a billion staph in some infection that you have.  You hit it with a bacteria, with an antibacterial, and you kill all of them but one.  Now, that one, next time when it grows, you know, all of those will grow back and every single one of them will be resistant. 
[00:20:00]  Oh, my God.  They mutate.  Yeah.  And then they put out these things called plasmids, which is little bits of DNA that go,  hey, look, this is how we defeated this fucking antibiotic.  And so they, and they teach the other staph that's around them how to do it.  So they kind of communicate with these little loops of DNA. 
[00:20:30]  And so before you know it, the whole world is resistant to almost every antibiotic that we have right now.  Oh, man.  The only antibiotic that MRSA is sensitive to.  Is your wine.  Yeah.  You have to just amputate the arm.  Take a Civil War treatment.  Is vancomycin, and it's also sensitive to an oral medication that you can take called Bactrim. 
[00:21:00]  If you have a superficial skin infection, which is usually what young, otherwise healthy men get,  which I don't know why then Fez would get it.  Wait, now, would Fez's be beyond the point of the Bactrim?  What is it called, Bactrim?  I'm sorry, say that again.  Would Fez's boil be, I don't know if you saw it.  Would it be beyond the point of taking the oral?  When you have a collection of pus like that, you can't, the antibiotic can't get into the center of it very well because there's no blood supply in there. 
[00:21:30]  I mean, that's how antibiotics get to.  Ah.  Right, right.  And so it's hard to get in there.  So that thing, if it's got a fluid collection at all, it's got to be drained.  Yeah, but will the pus reinfect the area when the fluid's being drained?  I guess.  Dr. Steve, did you see the video?  Yes. 
[00:22:00]  You saw Fez's video?  Yes, I did.  So what do you think it is?  Just by a quick look, obviously you can't diagnose like that.  It's not the best quality video either.  It certainly looks like an abscess.  An abscess.  And how are those caused?  It could be caused by a lot of different things.  He could have had an epidermal inclusion cyst, which is the thing that Voss has behind his ear.  That smells real bad.  It smells real bad.  In his brain.  We've talked about that before where if you have a little piece of skin that gets driven under the skin, 
[00:22:30]  it will grow and make a cyst because it can't slough off like normal skin does because it's actually growing under the skin.  So you get this little cyst there, and you can have one for years and not know anything about it until it gets infected.  And the ones under the arm will become infected pretty readily.  And doesn't the MRSA, how does it get inside the body if the bug is living outside the body? 
[00:23:00]  Well, that's a really good question.  Of course it is.  I asked it.  Yeah, but I sent it to you.  True.  If you have a hair follicle that gets irritated.  Could it be an ingrown hair?  Yeah, it could be an ingrown hair.  I hope it turns out to be an ingrown hair after what this place had to do.  Oh, yeah.  Where there's a wick that can draw the bacteria from the outside to the inside. 
[00:23:30]  You know, every time you brush your teeth, you shower your blood vessels with bacteria,  but the body is pretty well able to deal with that.  But, you know, every once in a while, one will get snagged someplace where it can grow.  And then it tries to find its way out of the body, right?  Yeah, well, the body tries to work a way to get it.  Try to push it out.  Yeah.  So, you know, it'll tend to grow toward the surface. 
[00:24:00]  Now, the way you can tell a cyst is there will usually be a little hole where the original  entry wound was, and so there will be a little hole with white crap beyond it, and that's  actually the cyst.  So, what are the odds that it's MRSA?  Oh, they're pretty good these days.  You know, skin infections are MRSA until proven otherwise.  Whoa.  Oh, but Steve, is it hard to get rid of, or no?  No, actually not. 
[00:24:30]  I mean, it sounds scarier than it is.  Now, listen, MRSA's a real problem when you've got a nursing home resident who's got a bad  immune system, and it's growing in...  Oh, who gives a shit about those people?  They had their lives.  Exactly.  If you fuck them, you deserve what you get.  I'm talking about...  You cure that with a pillow.  Exactly.  The old handlebars, it's just MRSA fixer.  I want to know how it affects middle-aged shock jocks, okay?  Yeah.  Fuck those old bags.  Move out of your apartments.  The new people want to move in.  Let's go. 
[00:25:00]  So, yeah, if you have a compromised immune system or you're otherwise vulnerable, then  it's a problem.  And small kids and older adults are really at risk.  Yeah.  And mostly older adults.  People who are already sick, MRSA's a real problem for everybody else.  If you've been in a hospital...  All right, Dr. Steve, you're on the radio.  You're not dreaming right now.  Let's cut to the chase. 
[00:25:30]  Full of sick people.  Right.  Now, so Fezzy should not be in here unless he's been checked out and it's been determined  he doesn't have MRSA, right?  Well, he'll go to the doctor today.  After the show, I just found out.  Oh, is that right?  Yeah.  Yeah, see, the doctor's laughing.  Well, here's the thing.  If he doesn't rub his armpit on the console...  Oh, really?  It's Fezzy.  It's...  But what if he's touching it? 
[00:26:00]  Because I heard he was touching it.  And now he's touching the microphone and things like that.  Give me another chair.  Yeah.  Yeah, yeah.  Hold on a minute.  Dr. Kaku wants in on this discussion.  And Dr. Kaku's a big fan of Dr. Steve.  Dr. Steve doesn't like Dr. Kaku, though.  Oh, I do.  Dr. Kaku.  Good morning, boys.  I would like to help you out and understand MRSA.  Yes.  You see, MRSA is like the Borg on Star Trek. 
[00:26:30]  Once you kill one MRSA, it will communicate with the other Borg.  Now, think of your white blood cells as the Federation.  It will take more and more Federation to fight off the MRSA, which gives you the POS.  Right.  POS is like a river.  So resistance is futile, is what you're saying?  Resistance isn't completely futile, but the more you resist, the more they learn, and the more it does become futile. 
[00:27:00]  Futile.  It is indeed like the Borg.  Yes.  There you go.  Thank you, Dr. Kaku.  Your cells assimilate.  I think we've got to replace Dr. Steve with Dr. Kaku.  Dr. Kaku.  Who was that guy?  Sounded good, though.  That was pretty good.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Wow.  Wow.  So, Dr. Steve, in your opinion, just on what you've heard, obviously you can't make an accurate diagnosis. 
[00:27:30]  What should be done around here?  Should Fez be banned from the studio until after it's determined he doesn't have MRSA?  What should we do?  Should we constantly be Purelling?  Yes.  Yes?  It is sensitive to Purell.  Here's the thing.  Here are the risk factors for community-acquired MRSA.  Holy shit.  Okay.  Wait.  Hold on.  Hold on.  I want to hear the risk factors.  Yeah, but you're going to get it on the finger part of the back of the thing. 
[00:28:00]  Now, I can't use that Purell because you're putting MRSA on it.  Yeah, I'm not touching that Purell.  I'm not touching that.  Can I have a MRSA-free Purell, please?  Can someone Purell the Purell bottle?  Exactly.  What if there's MRSA in it?  These guys clean the studio, Dr. Steve.  Is that good enough?  Well, it'll have to be.  I mean, what else can you do?  You're already in there.  Oh, really?  What else can I do is go home?  Because they disinfect hospitals all the time, and you never see MRSA in a hospital.  Oh, yes, you do.  Yeah.  Oh, literal Jim.  But, Steve, I'm on the other side of the room.  Opie's in MRSA zero. 
[00:28:30]  Now, on Opie's side and my side, is it a difference in who's going to get MRSA?  I would say that he would be at more risk being where there's probably more...  It's fun for the radio, but great.  Spores.  More spores.  Who sits...  Ronnie.  Here, Ronnie B?  Ronnie B.  Ronnie B sits where I am.  But Ronnie B was the guy in the hospital.  Maybe he brought it in here.  Well, you don't have it.  Maybe Ronnie B brought the MRSA in here.  He does.  He was singing that Marvin Gaye song, MRSA, MRSA, ME. 
[00:29:00]  Boo.  And then Fez...  Joke has MRSA.  And then Fez being the sponge for every disease known to man, got the MRSA from Ronnie.  Because Ronnie, you know, Ronnie laughs at MRSA.  Yeah, he does.  He dips his cigar in it and smokes it.  That's right, he does.  Fucking animal.  Fucking laughed at MRSA.  MRSA got sad and jumped on Fez.  Yeah.  That's what happened.  Oh, dude, I don't need MRSA.  No shit.  But these assholes down the hall, oh, we looked it up.  Oh, really?  You looked it up?  Really?  They looked it up? 
[00:29:30]  Well, they said you get it in hospitals.  And I had to be the one to tell them, well, yeah, it comes out of the hospital because  the jackass is in the hospital, gets the MRSA, and now moves on to affect other people,  right?  Yeah, here's the thing.  Thank you.  Let's talk about the risk factors.  Contact sports, so close contact can spread easily, like if you have cuts and abrasions  and skin-to-skin contact.  Here's the other one, living in crowded or unsanitary conditions.  And I think that that studio certainly fits. 
[00:30:00]  Yep.  Mm-hmm, exactly.  You know, you see them in child care centers, jails, you know, military training camps, stuff  like that.  Dr. Steve, how long does it live on a surface for before it dies?  That's a great question, and I would say it would be hours rather than days.  All right, so hours, and it's been disinfected, all the console and everything.  No, it's got you.  I think we're MRSA-free in here.  If Fez touched it yesterday, like say you rub this MRSA boil on. 
[00:30:30]  Everything in here.  Right.  Yesterday at 4 o'clock p.m., will we probably be okay by now?  Yeah, well, if there was juicy stuff still, it could live there.  Like if he just walked up someplace and it was allowed to make a seal over it, there could  be MRSA living in there.  But my understanding of MRSA is that although it can be spread by fomites, which is what  you're talking about, where it's spread, you touch an inanimate object and someone else 
[00:31:00]  touches it.  Yeah.  It's likely after a period of time.  But yeah, it's mostly spread human to human.  So I think in that regard that you're less at risk.  I think if they disinfected the place, you should be okay.  Should be.  If you really go to the doctor, though, and not come into work.  No kidding.  Yeah, yeah.  I see.  Stay home!  Dr. Steve is saying, go to the doctor.  Right.  Get seen ASAP with that. 
[00:31:30]  Right.  And the problem is, you know, when you're living in Manhattan, getting in to see the  doctor today is always an issue.  Fuck that.  You go to an emergency room.  Or go see Gary down the hall, because, you know, he knows all about MRSA now.  Dr. Gary.  Yeah, because he Googled it.  The place is insane, Anthony.  It's insane.  That Fez can contract things, can't he?  Yeah, he can.  You guys, being healthy young adults, are much less likely to contract serious MRSA infection 
[00:32:00]  just from casual coffee.  What about massive doses of alcohol?  Does that help?  Because I'm thinking I'm in the clear of that.  You pickled the shit out of MRSA.  You pickled that shit.  People are suggesting we not fuck Fez's armpit.  Well, that's great.  That's easy for you to say.  It's nice and pussy right now.  Yeah.  Lubed up.  This is the time to do it.  Have a little fun with some axolism. 
[00:32:30]  Yeah.  Axolism is the act of having sex with your armpit.  Or someone else's armpit, obviously.  Sexy.  MRSA.  As big as your imagination, Doc.  As big as your imagination.  Linger longer.  All right, brother.  Dr. Steve, thank you so much.  I don't know if I helped you any.  No, I have the complete heebie-jeebies right now.  Yeah.  Much less likely that you're going to come down with something serious because of this. 
[00:33:00]  Serious.  Or XM.  That's a good one.  Thanks, Chip.  I had MRSA one time, but I got rid of it.  Same sentence.  It was no big deal.  All right, Dr. Steve.  Thank you, Dr. Steve.  My doctor's on the line to help us out.  Yes.  Kevorkian.  My doctor.  Yes.  I think the first thing we need to do is give Fezzy a nice anal cleansing and see if he  has strep throat.  Oh, now.  See, this is based on the fact that my old doctor insisted on putting fingers on my ass 
[00:33:30]  when I went in for strep throat.  You figure it out.  Digging in.  Linger longer.  You figure it out.  I'm just digging in.  Huh?  I'm just digging fingers in your hiney hole.  Well, I wouldn't call it digging in.  I mean, he had to check the prostate because my throat was sore.  That makes all the sense in the world, right?  I so have the heebie-jeebies.  Like, I'm just...  I wouldn't touch anything.  I'm like, I'm scratching myself, but I'm grabbing, like, my shirt and, like, this. 
[00:34:00]  What's on your arm?  What?  No, that was a mosquito bite.  You sure?  From last night.  Are you sure?  I'm positive.  Are you sure?  I'm positive, but I'm keeping it away from everything.  Yeah, because now you got an open wound.  I need a band-aid.  Get me the Clorox and Purell.  That mercy could jump right in there.  No!  Yes, it can.  Fuck.  Oh, yes, it can.  How do I...  I gotta block that.  Are you glad that I got this place disinfected now with the hazmat guys?  I'm all fucking heebie-jeebie'd out.  Right? 
[00:34:30]  Right?  Yeah.  Mm-hmm.  Mm-hmm.  You know what?  What?  You going home?  Yeah, I'm just leaving.  I'm gonna get this Clorox wipe.  Right?  Right?  There's probably Purell on it.  I mean, there's probably Mercer on it, though.  Dude.  Yeah, don't touch anything in here.  Look.  I'm gonna throw my hands or something.  I'm wiping off the armrests of my chair.  I think we got Fez on the line.  Fez.  Good morning. 
[00:35:00]  Do you have Mercer?  I don't know what I have, but this is really something I was trying to keep to myself,  to keep private.  That didn't work out very well, Fez.  No.  Let it be known...  We have always respected your privacy.  Let it be known that Anthony is scrubbing his chair as he talks to you, Fez.  I got a tweet that you might have Mercer.  Then I've seen the video, so I forced SiriusXM to completely clean this place from head to  toe. 
[00:35:30]  Did you feel it's hunger?  When are you going to the doctor?  I'm going to the doctor this afternoon, right after the show.  Oh, after the show.  Oh, poor SiriusXM.  I'm going to have to re-clean the whole place.  And I will...  We don't know this is Mercer.  We don't know that.  Did you guys discuss that it might be Mercer on the show?  Oh, it came up, yes.  Then how are you keeping it private?  You talk to a lot of people every day.  You know, I thought we had an understanding, Opie. 
[00:36:00]  You know, I was listening on the way home and...  It didn't sound private to you?  It didn't sound very private the way Ronnie was going off.  Yeah, yeah.  Let me say this.  Let me say this.  That's Mr. Sa to you.  Oh, Mr. Sa.  Gotcha.  Ah, the respect given to the disease.  As Anthony scrubs everything.  You brought that in yourself.  That doesn't have Mercer.  I know.  What am I doing?  I'm cleaning my own computer.  Well, it's been in here.  You got Anthony completely freaked out.  It's not like I've ever been in that studio after cherry darts. 
[00:36:30]  That's just a little fecal matter.  Yeah, a little hiney hole stuff.  Just floating in the air.  Now, Fez, is it bigger than it was yesterday?  Oh, it's as big as your imagination.  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.  Mugget asshole.  And is it getting like a head on it?  Is there an exit point that you think the pus will come out of?  Yeah.  No, I was hoping for this thing to get a little crown on it, you know, so it could start to leak 
[00:37:00]  because it is extremely painful.  It is gigantic now.  It is gigantic.  Mercer is very painful.  It's a very reddish purple color.  Oh, Jesus.  You got Mercer.  Did you pop that thing in studio yesterday?  No, it hasn't popped yet.  I heard you guys were thinking of popping it yesterday.  Well, yeah, I would if I could go near it.  It's that sore.  Oh, so you can't even move your arm?  No, but I'm taking every precaution.  I'm going to wear a T-shirt underneath my shirt today. 
[00:37:30]  You took your shirt off yesterday in here.  Oh.  Now, how long did it take to go from just a little, like, blemish into this big boil?  About a weekend.  A weekend.  Like Saturday to Sunday.  Saturday to Sunday.  Wow.  He's got MRSA.  And is it soft?  It grows that fast.  Would you quit saying I have MRSA?  Is it soft or is it like a hard lump?  It's pretty solid.  Pretty soft.  It's like I dropped a hard-boiled egg somewhere in my armpit and couldn't find it. 
[00:38:00]  Oh, God.  Oh, God.  This is unbelievable.  I can't be here.  And now you said you were thinking of popping it.  I can't be here.  But how would you, like, were you going to stick it with a pin or something?  I wasn't sure what to do.  Maybe a toothpick.  I don't know.  You know, if I could get my neck to work.  Gnaw at it.  I'm not sure.  Gnaw at it.  Oh, God.  Oh.  What is Ronnie saying about this? 
[00:38:30]  Ronnie's basically saying that I should bathe more.  Yeah, I know Ronnie laughs at shit.  Ronnie laughs at just about everything.  But is he a little worried about the MRSA thing?  Let's see.  On the Opie scale?  No.  Yeah.  Opie's worry scale is pretty high.  Well, I have a newborn son at home, Fezzy.  So I've got to take all precautions.  So this company here was jumping through hoops.  They were here all night long cleaning the place.  You're going to notice that.  We always have to bend over for the breeders, don't we? 
[00:39:00]  You're going to notice a.  Get a carriage, own the world.  You're going to notice a fresh smelling studio.  No dust.  The rugs are nice and clean.  The walls are clean.  The ceiling's even clean.  They even cleaned the light fixtures.  Don't you think that was needed anyway?  It really was.  I mean, if it took a fucking horrible disease to clean this place, so be it.  So what we're saying, Fez, every, I don't know, let's call it every month, look up some 
[00:39:30]  crazy ass disease and just casually say you might have it and then we get this place cleaned  up.  I don't have to look.  Yeah.  No kidding.  Now, Fezzy, are you a WebMD guy, Fez?  Yes, but I, you know, whenever I have a symptom, I'll look it up.  But I don't start at the top of the list.  I go down to the fatal ones.  Oh, you start with the very serious ones.  Why don't we do a little WebMD?  Fezzy, we're going to do WebMD live on the show today.  Well, what I'll do, Opie, is I'll hurry over. 
[00:40:00]  No!  No.  I'll let you, because here's the thing, you're going by Twidios.  Is that scientific?  I don't think so.  I wish I went by Twidio.  I went by a rumor that someone tweeted me.  I didn't even know there was a video until this morning.  I think we should put Fez in that studio over there and treat him like when Spock went in  Rathacon.  Yeah.  And it's like, no, you'll contaminate the whole chamber.  And we have to just talk to him.  Can we put him in a bubble today? 
[00:40:30]  Can you do the show from a bubble?  He's already dead, yeah.  Yeah.  You have been and always will be my friend.  Let me come in, show it to Opie up close, and let him decide.  Oh.  Face the boil.  Fezzy, tell us what you got.  Because we're looking it up on WebMD for you.  We're going to diagnose you right now, because this WebMD is perfect every time.  Okay, it's a boil.  Put some kind of boil thing in there to start with.  Go ahead and put boil in.  It's a gigantic red lump.  Gigantic red lump. 
[00:41:00]  What does WebMD say?  Well, WebMD's looking, Danny's looking for that.  Let me just ask Fez, have you changed anything, like your deodorant or anything?  No, I haven't.  Did you shave your armpits or something?  Nope, that hasn't happened.  Because it could be an ingrown.  What about hygiene, showering, bathing?  Did you take a few days?  I like, you know, if people like to take a few days and sit in their own filth, that's  fine.  What are you doing?  I have bathed. 
[00:41:30]  Now, they say you get MRSA from the hospital, but we all know you didn't go see Ronnie when  he got his appendix taken out, so you obviously didn't bring MRSA home with you after the  big visit.  Wow, just beat a MRSA patient while he's there.  All right.  What is Danny doing?  Danny knows what he's doing.  He's looking for symptoms.  We're going to tell Fezzy what he has.  Drainage of pus.  Why do you need a doctor when you've got a WebMD?  A lump or bulge is the symptom. 
[00:42:00]  Abscess overview.  An abscess is a tender, usually pressed masses, generally surrounded by a colored area.  Uh-oh.  Oh, oh.  Different color.  From pink to deep red.  The middle of the abscess is full of pus and debris.  What's the debris part?  I don't know.  What kind of debris do you think you have in your Fez?  Sounds like after Katrina.  Dorito crumbs?  Yeah. 
[00:42:30]  Painful and warm to the touch.  Is it warm to the touch?  Let me see.  Well, it's hard to tell.  It's my armpit.  Of course, it's going to be warm.  Yeah, it is warm.  Yeah, it's a warm area.  Abscesses can show up in any place on the body.  The most common sites are in your armpits, areas around your anus, and your vagina, too.  How's your vagina?  Do you have one around your vagina?  I can't reach.  And, of course, at the base of your spine, teeth, if you have that, and the groin. 
[00:43:00]  Tailbone, spine.  And from inflammation around a hair follicle can also lead to the formation of an abscess,  which is called a boil.  Yeah.  I mean, I'm nothing but hair follicles.  Yeah.  Yeah, you are a hairy gentleman.  So we're telling Fezzy that's what he's got there, Danny?  Or is there other options?  Oh, it says, you know, antibiotics don't normally cure the abscess.  Right.  It does have to be cut open and drained.  What if I held one under my arm real tight? 
[00:43:30]  Just take a penicillin tablet and hold it under your armpit.  That'll work.  Fezzy, do you have any, now, are you a little squeamish that they might have to cut this thing  open and put a drain in there?  It is hurting so badly right now that, you know, someone could come by and just bite it.  Oh, you don't care at this point.  I'm not a rabid wolf, bite this thing.  Just get rid of it, right?  So you're up nice and early.  Why don't you go to the emergency room right now?  All they got is, like, drunk driving patients in the fucking waiting room. 
[00:44:00]  All right, here's what happens.  I go to the emergency room.  I go to the hospital.  I could end up getting MRSA.  That's true.  He's thinking ahead.  He's being safe.  He doesn't want to get MRSA while getting checked out to see if he has the MRSA.  Jesus.  The MRSA.  The MRSA.  Wow.  Well, it looks to me.  It sounds more like a boil, but isn't a boil?  More like an abscess.  Isn't that a close family member of MRSA?  It's a different type of infection. 
[00:44:30]  Of the boil family.  Yeah.  A different type of bacteria.  Do you mind if we take bets on your demise?  No.  I'm going to bet.  You do that every day anyway.  I'm going to bet it's MRSA.  Ann's going to bet it's what?  A boil?  Well, I'm just saying your standard abscess.  Abscess.  Yeah, yeah.  And Jimmy, what do you think it is?  I think it's a cyst, and I think it's skin that wouldn't slough off.  Slough off.  Thank you, Dr. Steve.  And what will they have to do with that, Dr. Steve?  They're going to have to lance it, because blood is what takes the antibiotic through 
[00:45:00]  the system, and it pushes fluid in through the cyst.  He should be a sleep doctor.  He really should be.  Fez, I'm getting more info on MRSA from the actual Dr. Steve.  Man, maybe I should read this before I read it out loud.  Oh, that quack?  It's mainly transmitted by skin-to-skin contact.  Have you had any skin-to-skin contact? 
[00:45:30]  Oh, any wrestling going on in your apartment?  No, everything you've brought up, you know, like you can get it in the locker room.  Do you think I've ever seen a locker room?  Online, probably, but I wouldn't think live.  Only in the world of DVDs.  As you can see, and you guys are young and healthy for the most part, the risk of transmitting  this is minimal in that case, all joking aside.  I would recommend that Fezzi be seen by a doctor sooner rather than later. 
[00:46:00]  Oh.  But that is more for his sake to prevent worsening of the infection.  Dr. Sooner?  We are talking community-acquired MRSA, if that's even what it is.  It could be some other bacterium, don't forget.  The very young and the very old are mostly at risk and mostly in institutional settings.  Have you been in an institutional setting recently, Fez?  Not recently.  Not recently, no. 
[00:46:30]  Do you hang out in nursing homes?  No.  That hasn't happened.  Now, didn't Retard Island used to be like a place that they put people with the plague  and crap like that?  Typhoid Mary lived here.  Yeah, Typhoid Mary.  Oh, that's great.  I like how it's like a map of the Hollywood stars over there, but it's just horrid, diseased  people.  So it was a place, though, where they had hospitals and sanitariums and whatever they had back  then.  Absolutely. 
[00:47:00]  Yeah, so abs-a-solutely.  So it could be transmitted over years.  Thanks for trying to make me laugh, Anthony.  Thank you.  I try, Fezzy.  Is it true that Ronnie named the Boyle?  There's been different names for it.  Yeah?  Like what?  You know, Bobby Mercer.  Yes, Bobby Mercer.  He named it Bobby Mercer.  Bobby Mercer.  Fucking Ronnie, Jesus.  What about Susan Boyle?  Is that too obvious? 
[00:47:30]  Uh, apparently, I think that was on the family guy.  You know what I would call it?  But it does apply.  You know what I would call it?  Baby girl.  Because her name is Mercer.  Have Mercer.  You know what I call it?  What?  Half day for Opie.  Get the car, Kenny.  Get out of here.  We're getting the fuck out of here.  Would you calm down until you see it up close? 
[00:48:00]  Oh, my God.  You want to see it up close?  No!  Yes.  I get the heebie-jeebies.  Can you see it up close, Fezzy?  I don't like that.  It would put my mind at ease.  Yep.  And my crotch in turmoil.  No.  My God.  I would be sleeping if I was you, Fez.  What are you doing up this early?  I think we woke him up.  What's he doing?  His armpit's fucking hurting.  Yeah, that's probably...  I have a sore armpit.  Yeah.  There's no sleeping position that helps.  It's just rolling around on your bed with your boil.  Well, we still think... 
[00:48:30]  It's like having an extra pillow.  Jesus.  An infected pillow.  That's nice.  Yeah, that's wonderful.  Things are going to bust open and look like Lizzie Borden's parents' bed.  Dave, could it be anything else?  Nice 200-year-old joke.  According to WebMD.  Right.  There's been no other bludgeoning since then.  Unfortunately.  We've got to...  It's weird.  Let's go with Bob Crane's hotel room.  It's a little close.  Bob Crane.  And that's good.  Nice.  I should use Bob Crane.  Damn it.  It's going to look like Waterloo. 
[00:49:00]  Yeah.  Okay, Chip.  All right.  I think it's going to be either Mercer, Cancer, or...  No.  Or...  Have you been losing weight, Fezzy?  Oh, yeah.  Not trying.  Oh.  Oh, boy.  You know what that is, right?  That's not good.  That's not good.  But if it grew so fast, and it's very tender to the touch, and maybe it has a little give  to it...  Does it have a little give to it?  Very little, but it does.  Yeah.  That's not a solid mass, like a lock, is it?  Can you squeeze it right now for us? 
[00:49:30]  No!  Can you squeeze it right now for us, Fezzy?  Don't.  No, it hurts too bad.  Oh, wait.  Dr. Steve's calling in.  Hold on.  Oh, Dr. Steve's back.  Yeah.  Dr. Steve, you're on with Fezzy.  Hey, Fezzy.  Hey, you're on Weird Medicine.  Go ahead.  How ironic that we were making fun of the Wellness Channel yesterday.  I know!  We could use their help today.  And then you guys are in there wringing your hands like a bunch of...  Someone told me...  Hand wringers or something.  Dr. Radio.  Like...  Yes, like hand wringers. 
[00:50:00]  Well, I've just perelled for the 10th time in the first hour of the radio show.  Thank you, Fezzy.  Hey, save some for me.  Dr. Steve, you got the patient on the line.  Yeah, man.  So, you're going to the doctor today, I understand.  Yes, I am.  Okay, yeah.  Let me ask you something.  Oh, shit.  This is what you couldn't tell from the video.  When you push on it, does it feel solid or do you feel gushy? 
[00:50:30]  I just asked that same question, Dr. Steve.  Thank you for concurring.  Well, Dr. Steve doesn't listen to the show.  It's pretty solid.  It is?  I mean, like, I can't feel anything moving underneath it.  What...  And is there...  From the video, it looks like there might be a little hole in the middle of it.  Is that...  No.  No, there's no sort of head on it or crown or anything.  Okay.  Crown?  Was it King Boyle?  As far as you're concerned, you didn't have a cyst there before or any kind of skin problem 
[00:51:00]  there in the first place?  No.  Okay.  All right.  Now, this...  Is this how you pick up people in bars?  All right, y'all.  Yeah, all right.  Hey, um...  Sounds to me like non-Hodgkin's lymphoma.  Oh, God!  What doctor said that?  That was Dr. Steve.  Dr. Norton.  Dr. Steve, you're very serious.  What are you thinking?  Well, I'm just curious if it feels solid, then it may be a skin cyst that's gotten infected 
[00:51:30]  and it just hasn't gotten to the point yet where there's just cups of pus in it.  So what it is is the area gets inflamed and feels very solid.  And then after a while, the white blood cells going to fight off the infection, they die and turn into pus.  Yes, yes.  Yes, and they'll liquefy the stuff in there, which is really just sloughed off skin. 
[00:52:00]  And when they go in, they won't find a collection of pus.  What they'll find is a semi-solid cottage cheesy sort of...  Oh, Dr. Steve!  Steve, how bad does that stuff smell?  Oh, you smell Voss's ear.  It's a thousand times worse.  Wow.  Well, Fezzy, if we find out you're not going to die from this, we're going to do a lot of fun radio with the pus.  Fez, you could also be like a superhero. 
[00:52:30]  You know how Spidey shoots the webs out?  Yeah.  You could lift your armpit and just hit people with hot pus.  Hot puss!  Cottage cheese, man.  I don't know the name for this superhero, what type of uniform you'd wear, but it's a hell of a superpower.  It could be a good rock song, too.  Hot puss!  Hot puss!  I love it.  Why couldn't you have waited until October 15th when we're doing What the Hell is That?  Oh, nice plug!  Oh, look at you, Dr. Steve is really good at this. 
[00:53:00]  I'm sorry that my boy all has a mind of its own.  It certainly does.  So, Steve, I know you haven't seen Fez, you've seen a little video, you've talked to him a little bit.  What are you thinking?  Well, it looks like something is definitely inflamed and probably infected, and he just needs to, for his own sake, to get it taken care of before it becomes a bigger problem.  Right.  These things...  A bigger problem, I can't put my arm down. 
[00:53:30]  Yeah.  I've seen...  I saw one on a guy's back once that went from about an inch in diameter to six inches in diameter.  You know how to party.  Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.  And so, just leaving it is...  If it's an active infection, it can get bigger and more fluctuant, meaning that it gets more...  Fluctuant.  Fluctuant.  I love the new words that you're getting for...  Fluctuant.  Like a hot air balloon.  The fluctuance is changing.  And I love the thought that Fez can't put his arm down, and he's just Heil Hitler-ing around his apartment. 
[00:54:00]  But no, he always looks like he's casually leaning on a lamppost, like in those 1920s pictures.  Looks like a mime.  Like I'm leaning my elbow on a short guy's head.  Yes!  Another guy on the line saying his father had the MRSA and was in the armpit.  Yeah, well...  I'm still going with MRSA, man.  I think Ope is right. 
[00:54:30]  I'm going with MRSA.  I'm going with standard abscess.  Dr. Steve, will you just go ahead and say I'm dying to satisfy Ope?  Because he won't stop until you leave me at a fatal diagnosis.  Yeah, he really wants this to be done.  Well, how about we do a little WebMD with Dr. Steve?  What's the best-case scenario and the worst-case scenario with Fezzy?  Oh, okay.  And obviously we're doing this for the entertainment of our audience.  We're not going to hold you to this.  Best-case scenario, it's a sterile abscess, meaning that the environment in there is so fucking noxious that even bacteria can't live. 
[00:55:00]  Oh, shit!  And that's the best-case scenario?  All right, what's the worst-case scenario?  Well, the worst-case scenario, that the infection continues to grow and he ends up with a bigger abscess in the armpit.  And the armpit is the avenue to the arm and also is attached to the larger structures of the body. 
[00:55:30]  So you'd be concerned of that infection spreading to more important structures.  The armpit's no big deal.  Now, I have to say, that latter, the worst-case scenario, is very unlikely.  Most of these things are relatively benign.  Once they're drained, you can treat it with antibiotics and there's no ongoing problems.  All right.  Wow.  Well, enjoy the clean studio, Fez. 
[00:56:00]  Yes.  It smells real nice in here.  Thank you for a change.  Fezzy will be fine.  What did you say, Dr. Steve?  I didn't hear you.  No, I'm serious.  I'm not hanging up on you.  I really didn't hear you.  All right.  Fezzy will be fine.  Boo!  God damn it.  I've never learned.  Fezzy, you're going to be fine.  Thank you.  Yeah.  I've been telling people that. 
[00:56:30]  All right.  So maybe I panicked a little bit to get the company running around here like lunatics.  But the place is clean, so it smells and looks great, though, Fezzy.  It needs to be done anyway.  Start thinking about something you have for next month so we can get it cleaned again.  Yeah.  You were able to take pus and make lemonade.  It just worked out for the best for everybody.  Pus aid.  Yes.  Pus aid.  All right, Fezzy, try to go back to sleep.  Watch Mask or the Elephant Man and how he slept. 
[00:57:00]  I think you've got to prop pillows up.  And you saw that.  You see that.  You turn us on to that TV show.  What?  What?  Boyles and Mercer?  What the fuck was it called?  Horters.  Horters, yeah.  Horting Pus under his arms.  Oh, it's the, like, wacky disease.  Within or something.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Monsters Inside.  Monsters Inside.  Oh, it's all bacteria.  Fez, you're a Monsters Inside type of guy.  You might want to watch that show. 
[00:57:30]  If you call cottage cheese a monster, okay.  Oh, I don't want to see this anyway.  I've got to eat some.  Oh, I see.  It's not looking.  All right.  Well, Fez, you coming in so we can see the boil?  Yeah, I'll be in.  Where's my cottage cheese?  All right, doctors.  I'm sure Danny can find you some great Lansing Pus videos.  I'm not looking at that screen at all.  Wait, what was the word you used, Steve?  Fluctuant.  Fluctuant.  Thank you.  Fluctuant.  All right, Dr. Steve, thank you, sir. 
[00:58:00]  And Fezzy.  Fezzy, you never sounded better, my friend.  I'm going to be listening intently to the Ron and Fez show.  You should get boils every day.  You're killing today.  You're killing.  All right.  It's got quato.  It is actually like a whole new mind under his armpit.  And we just gave the listeners a little oaf.  Oh, exactly.  Oh, it's an oaf.  It's an oaf.  Not quite an afro.  It's an oaf today.  That fucking afro shit was hilarious over the weekend.  I heard some of that.  Very funny. 
[00:58:30]  All right, Fezzy.  Say hi to Ronnie.  How's his appendix doing?  I think he's coming along nicely.  Yeah, I know the appendix is gone, but he's doing all right.  Yeah.  All right, guys.  Yeah, Fezzy, I'll be listening at 11 o'clock to the Ron and Fez show.  Yeah, enjoy the nice, clean studio.  I will.  Thank you.  All right.  Take it easy, Fezzy.  Fezzy from Ron and Fez.  Poor Fez.  It's just a fucking campground for bacteria.  I don't know what the fuck. 
[00:59:00]  I hate to say this, but I got to eat.  Yeah, let's take a break.  I'm disgusted.  We'll talk about Prince Poppycock next.  Prince Poppycock blew it last night.  Did he?  Did they show that?  He also had a bad performance.  I'm sure.  You don't watch America's Got Talent, do you?  No.  Maybe we'll do one minute on it then after the break.  All right, well, I do know.  Because everyone has their favorites.  It's down to four people.  That's what the Poppycock's doing.  I don't know.  You know, the Poppycock. 
[00:59:30]  But then, isn't that the show with the kid opera singer, too?  Yeah, she's going to win the whole thing.  She's going to win the whole thing.  Because America's stupid.  Why?  That's a great talent.  It should go to the Gravity guys.  Oh, those guys are still in it?  Yeah.  You think they look better than the Poppycock and the kid are still there?  Poppycock.  All right, we'll do the break right now.  It's a quick minute.  Poppycock blew it last night.  He went serious.  He's a lunatic, this Poppycock guy.  Did they sign him for a $50 million contract?  Yeah, but they give him $60 million.  Oh, Chip.  Poppycock does that. 
[01:00:00]  Goes on stage last night, takes it very seriously, and sings basically straight opera.  And everyone's like, what are you doing?  There's a 10-year-old fucking phenom that's going to close the show with her opera.  He didn't do like a big production number like he always does?  Not really.  And some kind of, you know, take a regular song and opera-fy it?  Nope.  He didn't do that whole...  Oh, boy.  Why do you think?  He got lazy.  I don't know.  No, man.  No way.  Is that because you think that the kid motivated him to do it?  Listen to me talking like I'm fucking an expert.  I know.  Like an expert wash woman. 
[01:00:30]  You think he got cocky and said, look, I could do this opera, I'm going to blow her away?  No, he might have thought that he was going to lose if it seemed too theatrical and not enough substance.  He gets cocky every night.  He sure does.  And his ears and asshole and teeth.  Fucking guy likes cock so much, he's got cum in his goddamn fucking mouth.  Damn, Chip is working blue today.  Yes.  I think I don't know what show I'm on.  Piers.  Piers Morgan.  Yeah, Piers.  Because Boat's all docking to his asshole. 
[01:01:00]  That's why he calls himself the Piers.  Fuck him and his mother.  I'm fucked up.  I had rum raisin ice cream.  Oh, rum raisin ice cream.  I'm zooted.  Zooted?  Fucked up Chip is hysterical.  On YouTube, there's a video called World's Largest Sist.  No, no, no.  I can't watch those.  Let me see it.  But Piers.  Piers Morgan had a buzz the fucking guy.  It's the finals of America's Got Talent.  He buzzes Poppy Geck. 
[01:01:30]  Yeah.  Buzzed him.  He buzzed the prince.  And then Sharon started yelling at Piers going, what the fuck you doing?  It's not about us today.  It's the finals.  Let America decide.  You don't need to buzz the guy in the fucking finals.  That Piers is a real asshole.  Yeah, fuck him.  Taking over for Larry King.  Fuck Poppy Cock.  And then the Defining Gravity guys had a little misstep at the end of their performance.  Oh.  Something fucked up there.  The lights come on.  And then the 10-year-old girl just blows it away. 
[01:02:00]  She's going to win.  She's going to be an international superstar, this 10-year-old opera singer.  She's nine.  Liar.  God damn liar.  So who else is it?  Those three?  And then I think his name is Michael Grimm.  He's a really, really good singer.  A great singer, but I don't know.  There's a million of those, I think.  Because it's a Vegas show they're looking for.  Time it doesn't.  You want to hear him?  He's got longevity.  Tell me if you...  Poppy Cock?  No, fuck Poppy Cock.  Who's this?  Oh, if you want Poppy Cock, all right. 
[01:02:30]  All right, really fast.  A little taste of the pop.  The PC.  The PC.  That's pretty much what he did. 
[01:03:00]  He took it down a couple of notches, and I think it fucked up his chances of winning  the whole thing.  Fuck the Poppy Cock.  This is the one I want to play for you real fast.  30 seconds in.  Michael Grimm.  Because you know a little bit about music.  Listen to this fucking guy.  All right.  When a man loves a woman 
[01:03:30]  Yeah, because of mine nothing matters  He'd trade the world  Well, the good thing is fine  If she's bad  He can see it  She can do no wrong  Turn his back on his best friend  He'd put it down  When a man loves a woman 
[01:04:00]  Yeah, Michael Bolton  That's doing his Michael Bolton impression  Who cares?  He's a good singer  He's really talented, but there's a lot of guys like that, so  Yeah  That kid's really not being lip syncing?  Huh?  That kid's really  Absolutely not, because NBC  Oh, the little kid?  Yeah, yeah, yeah  But you can't believe it's coming from her  Speaking of her, what's her name?  Jackie Ivanko  10 years old 
[01:04:30]  Get the fuck out of here  I'm pretty tired of her stupid opera face, too  Jesus 
[01:05:00]  She's got some control  But she still cries when, like, she can't play with her Barbies  Yeah  Goddamn right she does  Oh, Uncle Paul, really?  Yeah  She's 10 
[01:05:30]  She's 10 years old  I see you brought some opera records with you  Why don't you take a seat over here?  I was going to just listen to her sing opera  I loved John Opie and Anthony  That's all I was doing  What do you got there?  I see you brought a metronome  The best part of the Chris Hansen experience  We had him on a few times  He wanted our email so bad 
[01:06:00]  And not one of us, by the way  He said, yeah, here you go  Here's my email  Yeah, no fucking way  No fucking way is right  You ain't getting that one  What did he say?  I enjoyed doing the show  What's your email?  It's your email address  We're all like, get the fuck out of here  Nope  Nope  Nope  What do you think of the 10-year-old, man?  Pretty amazing, no?  A loaded question  No, a very talented, amazing prodigy 
[01:06:30]  I like to think that her father beats the shit out of her in a basement  Oh, Jesus  To make her practice  Like Jean Benet  Make her practice to sound as good as she does  Yeah  Well, that's really good  It's either that or she's the first perfect kid in the entire world  There's a natural talent that's there  That goes beyond lessons or anything  What's the other side, you think?  No one's that perfect  Well, that's what I was saying  She still, like, is an asshole kid that cries over stupid stuff  And, you know, she's a dummy  She's gonna be flying all over the world singing her opera shit 
[01:07:00]  Yeah, that's it  So I say this  She's hooked up for life right there  I say she wins the whole damn thing  Because America fell in love with her  I say Defying Gravity comes in second  And she's cute, so that works in her favor  We'll find out  It's not an ugly kid  We'll find out tonight  You get, like, an ugly kid singing opera  They wouldn't give a shit  They'd be like, oh, look at that  Ugly kid, we're not gonna put that on tour  It's kind of like when the black kids go missing  Ah, no news coverage whatsoever  That's the biggest complaint  Blonde hair, blue eyes goes missing  Oh, my God  Amber Alert  We all have to start looking around for license plates 
[01:07:30]  Fucking God forbid something happens to them  They make a law named after them  Right  Yeah, Shaniqua doesn't have a law named after her  It's never Shaniqua's law  Right  You never hear Tanisha's law  Right  It's always a cute white sounding name  Oh, exactly  Come on  This country sucks  It really does  Ah, well  I know you enjoy that, but you gotta admit  It kind of sucks 
[01:08:00]  I love our diversity  What am I gonna tell you?  All right  I guess that's all we got on America's Got Talent, right?  Yeah  You're not really watching the show, so  No, I just get my America's Got Talent news right here on the OPN Analyst  That was nine minutes more than I thought we'd get out of it, honestly  I'm actually interested in who wins the finals  It kind of was a big year for America's Got Talent  They had a lot of, you know, cool acts  Yeah  Yeah  Oh, yeah  We gotta eat 
[01:08:30]  Yeah, let's dream that  Yeah, it's, uh  The problem is, it looks like you're yogurt  And, uh, it could be non-Hodgian lymphoma  I love fast  It could also just be, uh, from wearing a hat too much  But you don't see a doctor as fast as you can  What?  Slough off  Slough off  Skin didn't slough off  Slough off  Did he use the word slough off?  More than I used the word if  Are you writing all this stuff down?  I don't need to 
[01:09:00]  Sloughings  I wake up screaming slough after he said it  A couple phone calls on AGT  Cody in Indiana  A regular  What's up, Cody?

And not talk  And write on truck boards  She'll just be in some fucking opera show  Alright, so she's not gonna win maybe  She might  I don't know  If I was the father  I'd say fuck this  Because this kid is way bigger  Than America's Got Talent  He should take his kid out  Well they might do  The American Idol thing  Where they pick the second best person  So then they can whore out

[01:14:30]  This is what  And I'm having this  I fucking hate  This is called the segue  Cause I know Jimmy wanted to talk about Chelsea  I'm so irritated  With critics  Because they were criticizing  Like her racial material  What?  At the VMAs?  What's wrong with doing racial material  If you're trying to be funny?  Because it's these New York Times pussies  Or these AOL pussies  Or these Entertainment Weekly pussies  They're just these fucking  Pussies  These dull, snarky, white boars  Who are  They think that the detached irony is really funny 
[01:15:00]  And a white girl up there  Or a white person up there  Doing any type of racial material  Yeah  If someone doesn't think she's funny  Alright, whatever  That's your judgment  Sure  But when they start saying that she's racial  Like, why would she even mention that she's  How is she not supposed to do racial material?  What was the problem they had?  They're cunts  What jokes did she do?  I don't know  I know when she first addressed Conway  She's like, let's talk about the  The big black elephant in the room  Then she mentioned Kanye  I was like, that's great  Fucking she mentioned it  And she talked about him being  The fucking race  It's like 
[01:15:30]  If you mention it  And it makes them uncomfortable  They say it wasn't funny  And that's what annoys me  Yeah  And this fucking twat  Who I'm seven with cheese on Twitter  If you think  If you don't like her act  You think she stinks  And you don't like the fact that I'm sticking up  Fine  But don't tell me I'm doing it  Just to get on her show  You fucking cunt  I haven't been on her show in over a year  I'm never in Los Angeles  Someone actually said that  That's what annoys me  You know, Jimmy  When it comes to talking about  Someone's show you could be on  You're just not honest  I will never be on Conan's show 
[01:16:00]  They don't like me  And I've never bashed Conan  Right  You fucking cunt  Seven with cheese  You're sticking up for a stand-up comic  That I like  For years  Right  Oh, that guy  She should be able to do a racial material  That's what annoys me  It's like these fucking  It was the highest rated VMAs in a long time  Good  Right  Well, they wanted to see if Kanye  Was going to pull his dick out or something  Right  Yeah, that's definitely part of it  And they knew Lady Gaga  Would be wearing something ridiculous  What an idiot  They got a watch  She was at the airport or something  At JFK 
[01:16:30]  They got a picture of her  And she's dressed like  Like just  Stupid  Stop it  You're at the fucking airport  She looks like a fool  You're at the fucking airport  You're a fool  Can we get our explanation  Of the meat dress again?

A lot  She's got eight hits 
[01:17:30]  Number one songs  You don't need to do this  For more attention  It's like a little piece  Of everybody  John Lennon  And John Winter  Johnny Winter  We're all pieces of everybody  Man  You know what?  You're right  There's some David Bowie  Going on  There's some John Lennon  Going on  There's some Johnny Winters  Going on  There's some Madonna  Going on  And there's some  Britney Spears  Going on  There's some John Holmes  Going on  Did you mention this?

Do they feed it to dogs or something?  I hope so  I'd hate to think it was wasted  Perez Hilton didn't like it  Why?  He didn't?  I don't know  I don't know what the reason was  He just didn't enjoy it  It didn't resemble Cox enough  Perez Hilton  What did he say about the meat dress?

It was fantastic  You're not an entertainer  You're some fucking  Wannabe jizz bag  No  Who drains little cum things  On people  Wow you guys edgy 
[01:19:30]  And then someone calls you out on it  And punches you in the face  And you didn't like it too much  And then he lied  Well maybe you should stop  He lied about calling the guy a faggot  Didn't he lie about saying the word faggot  You little bitch  Yep  You fruth  Oh I can't stand him  With his little white pencil  Drawing cum on people's mouths  On their pictures  Fucking contr-  He's not a funny writer  To me that's the problem with him  You're not a funny writer  No if you're drawing like cum bubbles  I don't mind that  But just write something funny  Take and coke drip shit

Oh fuck yourself  You don't like when they talk about  What Lindsay's wearing  Give this shit  She should be wearing a coffin  And a fucking  And a fucking satin pillow on her head  Wearing a coffin  Fucking  Drunken whore  Who do I want to fuck her?  She opened up the VMAs  With Chelsea Handler  Yeah it was alright  Yeah a nice little skit  Oh because they would say  That the rappers  The black rappers  Were like assaulting her  And following her through the hall  And smacking her ass  God these fucking  I cannot stand these fucking  You stunk  Well I want to know 
[01:20:30]  The racial material now  I want to know  What joke they had a problem with  It says  So we all agree  You stunk  All?  Who?  Who?  Who agreed?

[01:21:00]  Look I like Russell  But I thought she was  A better host than Russell  Yeah  I like him  I thought she was funnier  I thought that she didn't go  The predictable  Or I enjoyed it  And if you don't like her  You don't like her  It's not about not like  It's when they start to get like  Yeah  Like they mention the fact  That she did racial humor  And that's what annoyed me  If you think she sucked  Well whatever  That's a judgment call  Has there been one woman  That he's actually liked?  Think about it  It's a fucking  He loves the cock  He loves the cock  Loves it  Oh my god 
[01:21:30]  Cock balls  Yeah  Just loves it  Really  I want to know the joke now though  Maybe the guys could find it  Alright  I don't know  That's a quickie  But we have a  We have a mayor in New York City  That's just a jerk  She really is  Mayor Bloomberg  Mayor Bloomberg  I was reading in the paper today  Now I say this  I'm not a fan of the smoker 
[01:22:00]  I really am not  But I  But I think you guys  Should be able to smoke  Smoke a little something  Something here and there  Right  The mayor  Has now decided  That he's going to ban  Smoking in parks and beaches  Making it almost impossible  To smoke in the New York City area  Is that Goldie Wilson?  Goldie Wilson  Yes  Yeah  Yes  And it sounds like  Wow that's kind of a nice thing to do  Because he's trying to protect  The citizens of New York  Right 
[01:22:30]  That's complete bullshit  Language  Bullshit  So the mayor  Is trying to protect the people  That's such bullshit  And  Let's break this down for you  Yeah  He's banning smoking  In parks and beaches  Because a lot of you fuckers  Are really addicted  To your nicotine  Uh huh  And you're going to smoke anyway  And you're also going to think  Ah  Who's around in this fucking park  And you're going to light up  And then what's going to happen  And then the boys  Are going to come around  Because they now have to do their jobs  And I understand that  So I'm not  I'm not  Trashing the NYPD 
[01:23:00]  But now they're going to be  On the lookout  They won't even put them on it  They'll just put some fucking  Who do they put on something like that  Traffic agent  Park rangers  Like a low level guy  Yeah  Okay so they send the low level guys out there  Uh  To bust you  For smoking a stupid cigarette  In the middle of a park somewhere  When there's nobody around  Because New York City  Needs another revenue stream  That'll be more money  He's not protecting us  He's trying to figure out  Another way to make fucking money  Yeah  You know how many tickets 
[01:23:30]  You can give out to people  Smoking in parks and beaches  A shitload  Thank you Anthony  A shitload  You know something  Bigger than my imagination  Imagine all the grains of sand  On the beach smoking  Wow  Not a fan of smoking  I hate it  But I really feel like  You know  You guys are getting  Really fucked over out there  I have mixed feelings about it  As a fucking  Cunty ex-smoker  In a park though  As a cunty ex-smoker  What are you  What are you catching  From a smoker  In a New York City park 
[01:24:00]  You know what  You know all the shit  You're breathing in  On a daily basis  There's the waft  There's that waft  Of cloud of fucking  Cigarette smoke  It's also that people just  Again  People step on their cigarettes  You gotta have a sand ash  It's like who the fuck  Just stop it already  Cut the shit  I never was  I never really was a smoker  Here and there  But man  When someone else is smoking  You get a waft of it  Yeah  It's a nice  It's a nice smell  I hate it  Just a little waft though  Don't like the waft  I'm not talking full on  You know  Getting fucking 
[01:24:30]  The big cloud  Right in your face  No  The worst has always been  The smoldering cigarette  From the dick bag  At a bar  When you know  You could smoke in bars  That would  Take this cigarette  They did away with that  25 years ago  That was 25 years  This month  No way  They  It's that asshole  That would take the last drag  And then go  Twice  Just go  Dup  Dup  And leave it in the ashtray  It's just bent  And broken  And now smoldering  Like a forest fire 
[01:25:00]  Put your cigarettes out  Very annoying  Wow  Look at this  Opie  I used to have a job  Cleaning up litter on beaches  Here in Michigan  We once took out  Five big hefty bags  Filled with just cigarette butts  From a 300 foot stretch of beach  Wow  And one big log  From Opie  Can't live that one down  No  I'm fighting for your right  To shit outdoors people  Who do I get to ask next?  Mark Maron's in today  What do you think 
[01:25:30]  He's going to answer?  He seems like  Kind of a crazy guy  Shit  It doesn't mean you're crazy  If you shit outside Anthony  I take offense to that  It kind of does  I'm crazy for other reasons  But not because I shit outside  It kind of does  What do you think?  Mark Maron shits outside?  Um  Yeah  Right on  Or he has  He has  Yeah  No one makes a regular  You know  Thing of it  I don't make a regular thing  I'm sure you don't just run outside  Get in the elevator  Go downstairs  Like you're in your apartment 
[01:26:00]  And you just have to go outside  To shit  Imagine that's just your thing  Yeah  You just have to  You know  So often  Yeah  It's not a conspiracy theory  With this mayor shit  They don't give a shit  About the individual  No  They care more about  Bringing money in  Fines  They make believe they care  That's why  You have to look at this stuff  Closely  Yeah  They present it like  Oh we're taking care of you  But they're not  They want to fucking  Get more money out of your pocket  Anytime the government  Is taking care of you 
[01:26:30]  You're in trouble  It's also a move towards  Making smoking illegal  They're just making it  Where it's eventually  Going to be  They're forcing people  To quit without  Quote unquote  Making it illegal  And you know  Part of that is  The amount of money  Spent on people  For fucking smoking  It's a lot of money  Yeah it is  A lot of money  It is  And you know  It's kind of annoying  Because it's one of those  Avoidable things  It's like drinking  But I just envision  The mayor's around 
[01:27:00]  The mayor is around  With his people  And they start doing  The numbers  Like look  If we do this  You know how much money  We can bring in  Make some cash  Make some cash  Yeah  They do that  With everything  Restaurants  They implement  These regulations  And then  They go in  And you know  Find them  If they have too much salt  Now in their menu  Or they're not posting  The nutritional value  Of something on there  Think they give a flying fuck 
[01:27:30]  About it  People are still  Going to walk in there  And no matter what  The nutritional value says  They're still going to  Stuff their fat  Disgusting fuck faces  Like a Travis eating  As I  As I'm saying  That I'm watching  On the little TV  Going with your point  It's more basic than that  Where's the soda tax at  Do we officially  Have a soda tax  No I don't think so  Patterson got shot down  And I tried it  They shut down  But with the same vision  Of we're trying  To take care of our people  It's not going to prevent  People from drinking soda  No  But it is going to 
[01:28:00]  Bring more money in  It's all about  Bringing more money in  Syntax as they call it  Syntax  Yep  You see the syntax  In the cabs  That they implemented  Because the gas prices  Went up  And I think Ant  Made this point  Gas prices go down  They don't take that shit away  No they don't take it away  It  And again  They raise the price of gas  The second  Price per barrel  Goes up  Habib is out front  Of the gas station  With that big pole  He can't get out there  Fast enough  He can't get out there  Fast enough  The day they go 
[01:28:30]  And wow  Gas prices up today  A dollar and a quarter  And they're out there  That day  Then the gas prices  Go down  Well gas down  To $60 a barrel  And  Oh it takes a while  For it to reach us  Yeah  You were raising the price  The second it went up  You fucker  Very good point  I hate it  Yeah  I hate everything  Boy we sure don't like  A lot of things  Who  We don't  We just talk about 
[01:29:00]  Things we don't like  Because we're real  We're real  We're keeping it  We're not buying into  All this horse shit  No  And I hope  The people listening  Don't either  Man  Yeah  I want to  Ask something  Yes please  That  We  What happened  That guy got fired  Why did that guy get fired  For burning the Quran  Oh yes  Wow that is a big story  That guy got fired  For burning the Quran  That white guy got fired  For New Jersey Transit  It was an ethics thing  He got fired for 
[01:29:30]  By New Jersey Transit  What's the ethics  If you're exercising  Your free speech  Exactly  That's what I was like  I was like what the fuck  He lost his job  He'd been there 11 years  And he's the guy  The fat guy  With the dopey fucking  Is it the moral cause thing  Yeah they got some kind  Of morality cause  But the thing is  If you're just exercising  Your right to freedom  Of expression  Yeah it's like he has  A lawsuit on his hands  Oh he absolutely does  I'm sure lawyers  Are fucking all over him  Why could he get fired  For that  It's not a  He wasn't doing anything 
[01:30:00]  Unethical  He was exercising  His rights  I don't know  He got arrested  But  He got arrested  I don't know  Maybe he didn't  I don't think he did  I saw the video  The cops just kind of  Led him away  Oh okay  Got him away from the area  Oh sorry  There you go  Excuse me  I didn't know what I was talking about  Fenton was ushered  From the protest by police  On Saturday  And questioned  But he was released  Without charges  So okay I was wrong  So he wasn't even arrested  He said  This is America  And wanted to stand up for it 
[01:30:30]  In a tea party kind of way  A police source said  A police horse was talking  A police source  Oh oh  I thought it was one of those  Police horses  And that would have been odd  Yeah no  Mr. Red was funny though  Exactly  He described himself  As a loyal American  Exercising his right  To protest  Uh huh  Hmm  But uh  I guess they saw it differently  How the fuck  Can New Jersey Transit  Or whoever they are  Fire this guy 
[01:31:00]  When the police  Released him  Oh come on  He wasn't committing a crime  How is that a moral  These companies are ridiculous  They're so scared  They'll find ridiculous  I hope they'll fire you  Because oh they find out  He's a New Jersey Transit worker  And then they go  Oh so you let your people  Uh uh  Do this  Uh oh my god  We're Muslims  And we're not riding  Your trains anymore  He was uh  We're just gonna blow them up  He was off duty  Yeah  Don't matter  I I I obviously disagree with it 
[01:31:30]  But it don't matter  These companies will find  The dumbest things  I hope he sues them  For a lot of fucking money  Absolutely he will  That'll happen  And there's no way  It's hard to even protest  The Jersey Transit  Because people have to get to work  What's the ultimate  True  Hey uh just to throw  A little more  At the cigarette thing  Anthony uh  I would have  I would uh  Assume that New York  Makes a lot of money  On the cigarette taxes  Oh the taxes on cigarettes  So they don't want to  Ban smoking  Necessarily  Because then they  They would lose that revenue  Yeah they just  So I wonder if they put  How much more money  To suck out of  People that smoke 
[01:32:00]  So what do you think  So they put the law in place  Knowing they get  The cigarette tax money  But now they could also  Get more money  On top of that  Yeah  Yeah they find  Because they know  That people aren't  Going to stop smoking  Just because they have  These laws in place  Just like they're not  Going to stop drinking soda  Because there's a soda tax  That's what happened  With the bars  All the bar owners  Are like oh come on  We're going to go broke  Remember that  Bars because they smoke  No bars packed  Outside of the bar  Packed with people smoking  A lot of socializing  Going on outside the bars  Right  It didn't stop people 
[01:32:30]  From going out  And it won't stop people  From smoking in the park  Or they want  You know you get a ticket  For smoking in the park  Someone's going to go  And not going to say  Oh that's it I'm quitting  Because I got a ticket  Right  They'll pay the ticket  And hopefully not get caught  Next time but  Well we got another  We got another person  Moving on  We got another person  Apologizing today  Redskins Clinton Portis  Yeah  You heard about  Clinton Portis right  What did he do  He was talking about  That hot piece of ass  Did you  Did you

[01:39:00]  I think  They make it so much  You can't interact  You can't  You can't be involved  With  With athletes  You can't  You can't talk to these guys  You can't interact  With these guys  And I mean  You put  You put a woman  And you give her  A choice  To 53 athletes  Somebody gotta be  Appealing to her  You know  Somebody gotta  Fuck her interest  Or she gonna want  Somebody  You know  I don't know  What kind of woman  Want  If you get to go  And look at  53 man packages  And you just  None of this 
[01:39:30]  Is attractive  To me  You know  I know you're  Doing a job  But at the same time  The same way  I'm gonna cut my eye  If I see somebody  Worth talking to  I'm sure they do  The same thing  Clinton  You're awesome man  Thanks for hopping on today  We appreciate it  That guy said nothing wrong  Why did he have to apologize  He said nothing wrong  Yeah  Fuck the NFL  Fucking faggots  He said nothing wrong  I'm more offended  That I could barely  Understand him  But  He took a while  To get to his point  Dude he wasn't saying  That they don't  He was like  They may see guys  They find attractive 
[01:40:00]  53 men  The same as  I'm gonna  What a  We are just  A country  Of fucking  Chizbags  Washington Redskins  Running back  Clinton Portis  Had plenty to say  On the radio  Tuesday about  Women reporters  In NFL locker rooms  He didn't say that much  No  Let's see  NFL spokesman  Greg Aiello  Said the league  Quickly addressed  The players' remarks  With the Redskins  The comments are clearly  Inappropriate  Offensive  And have no place  In the NFL  What 
[01:40:30]  Fucking  Fuck  He said in an email  We have contacted  The Redskins  And they will discuss  The matter directly  With Mr. Portis  How about the offensive  Name Redskins  Exactly  The piling up  Of Indian bodies  You cunt  If you're gonna  Fucking  Get offended  You know  I could give a shit  But  If you're gonna  Be like that  Then how about  The fucking name  Of your team  Dummy  A few hours later  The Redskins  Issued a statement  From Portis  You're not allowed  To talk  Speak your mind 
[01:41:00]  What a lying country  In public anymore  You're just not allowed  To do it  They said  He's speak them  With forked tongue  This fucking guy  Should be able  To say whatever he wants  Because it doesn't affect  His play on the field  And somebody asked him  What he thought of something  Right  Why can't you  Why can't you answer it honestly  Another case  Of a guy expressing his opinion  Not attacking people  Just like that woman  From the  Who was the White House  Old lady that had to leave  Because she gave  An unpopular opinion  And him  And then somebody  On the other side  Right 
[01:41:30]  I forget who it was  Right  Don't answer a question honestly  We're training people  That if you don't lie  And say the right thing  You will have to apologize  We are a country  Of fucking liars  It's unbelievable  This guy  Like it or not  Should be able  To fucking answer  The question honestly  Dude if he said  You should be able  You should be able  To grab tits  Right  Then that's one thing  Nah he should be able  To say that too  He's right  He should be able  To say that too  But I can see the Redskins  Having a problem with that  Yeah they would have 
[01:42:00]  A problem with that  But he answered this honestly  That come on  Look we're naked  In the fucking locker room  And you got these  Broads in there  Of course  You know  There's some  There's some sexual tension  And sexual shit going on  But he didn't even say that  He just goes  How could they  53 male packages  He's just trying to be funny  He didn't even say  Big  So a few hours later  The Redskins issued a statement  From Portis  Meaning  Someone wrote the statement  For Portis  Some faggot white lawyer  Now here it is too  We heard what he sounds like 
[01:42:30]  When he's just speaking  Yeah  Now does this statement sound  Like um  Like um  This is Clinton Portis  That's not Portis  I mean you can see  How a white girl can fall for him  Like um  Remember the like um guy  Like um  Like um  So a few hours later  The Redskins issued a statement  From Portis  This was not from Portis 
[01:43:00]  Someone wrote this for him  To save his ass  Even though his ass  Shouldn't have had to be saved  For speaking openly  And answering the question  Honestly  I was wrong to make the comments  I did  And I apologize  He's  The statement said  I respect the job  That all reporters do  Bullshit  What?  Why?  It's a tough job  And we all have to work  And act in a professional manner  I understand  And support the team  On these issues  Fuck the Redskins  And fuck the NFL  I feel bad for Portis  That's not his words 
[01:43:30]  He shouldn't have had to  That's not his words  God this  Just a  Not his words  Country of fucking lies  Nobody is honest  About the way  They feel anymore  Dishonest  Pussies  That can't  No one can take  Anything  No one has a sense  Of humor about anything  You know  The  We have no balance  On anything  It's like  The  Being sexually harassed  Is wrong  But now it goes into  Where if you make something  That is a slightly  Inappropriate remark  The team has to  How about you let the guy 
[01:44:00]  If he's sorry  Say he's sorry  And if he's not  Alright we didn't agree with that  Whatever  Gives a shit  Yeah whatever is right  What's gonna happen  It's all these fucking  It's these worthless  Untalented fucking  PR people  And lawyers  None of them contribute  Anything  Creatively  In any way  They don't play the game  They do nothing  It's pure lunacy  It really is  It's insane  I was  It's insanity  I was  Having a party  On last Sunday 
[01:44:30]  No you weren't  And yes I was  I wasn't invited  So there was no party  Swear you were away  You were still  Shitting on a beach  You always have an excuse  Why I'm not invited  I noticed that too  I don't like it  Yeah thank you Jimmy  Well now that I know  What you're doing  Fucking water  I'm waiting until  It covers on my pool  At least I've never  Heard a story  Of you shitting  In a fireplace  So I'll wait  Until the weather  Gets a little colder  That doesn't sound  Like a bad idea  Shitting in a fireplace  Just imagine how  Well your fire will burn  Ah  With a few extra logs 
[01:45:00]  In it  Anyway  Yeah  I was having a party  And one of the guests  Said to my party  We're filling out  This paperwork  Downstairs  I was like  Oh what are you  Doing work  And she says  No my kids  Are being enrolled  In school  And this is all  The paperwork  I have to go through  It was a stack  I'm not shitting you  What used to be like  I remember  Going to  Mommy taking me  To school  To register me  For school  And you'd go there 
[01:45:30]  You fill out  A couple of little things  You sign something  And your kid  Is enrolled in school  And it pretty much  Had to do with  Is he retarded  Does he have his shots  That's pretty much it  That's about it  Now they have contracts  Parents have to sign  Off these contracts  With each like  Class  And the school  And  And  All this thing  That the school  Won't be responsible  For this or that  And that the child  Hasn't shown  Signs of  It's a giant  Fucking  Folder 
[01:46:00]  Of shit  You now have to  Fill out  So your kid  Can go to school  Because we're  The most litigious  Fucking  Cock nation  On the face  Of this planet  This country is being  Shut down by paperwork  By lawyers  And paperwork  Did you sign it  Electronically yet  It's amazing  Did you go through that yet  What's that  What  Over an hour and a half  On the phone  With Mr. Bob Eatman  Because I had to  Sign something  Electronically  What the fuck  Is that  Exactly  You need passwords  September 15th 
[01:46:30]  And you need a  Customer ID  What the fuck  Wait till you go  Through that  I don't like that  How about a fax  How about a fax  Send me a fucking fax  I sign it  I fax it back  Oh man  They got  It's getting more  And more complicated  I like that  You know what  I  And it scares the shit  Out of me  That I have to  In the car  That I have to  Send them to school  I don't believe  In the school system  Homeschooling man  But that's  That's stupid too  Right  Yeah  Because you want  Them to interact  With people  I want them  To interact  With people 
[01:47:00]  But I  I really  For the most part  And I'm the only guy  That went all the way  To college in this room  I thought it was  Horseshit  All the way  Apparently it was  Yeah  You're the only guy  In here that did it  But I really  Didn't believe in it  Yeah  I never bragged  About my diploma  Or nothing  Diploma  I didn't learn  Anything that I  Gave a shit  About in school  Did you  No  Some of the  Some of the  Subjects were  Kind of fun  But I had to  Take a class  On Russian history  Why  I was interested 
[01:47:30]  In a few things  That went on  Every so often  Some of the science  Shit was kind of fun  Yeah  Yeah  But then when they  Got into like  Chemistry and all that  Why  Yeah  That I kind of  Liked too  The periodical table  Everybody  Why did I need  To know that  Come on  Hydrogen  Number one  With a bullet  It's all bullshit  Though  It's all what  You're into  Or something like that  So 90% of the shit  You don't care about  At all  And then the other  10%  You only care about 
[01:48:00]  Every so often  Like history  They'd hit on something  That was kind of like  Wow that's cool  Okay I'll  Agreed  I'll get interested  In that  Agreed  But then the rest  Of the year  You're like  I don't care about  That shit  Agreed  So for the most part  You don't care about  What you're sitting there  Learning  I don't want my kid  Bogged down  With a bunch of  Fucking homework  That means nothing  In the end  You know  I'm hoping he's  I'm hoping  He has some kind of  Creativity in him  And stuff like that  That's to teach  Responsibility though  Away from the school  See  They give you homework  So it teaches 
[01:48:30]  The child responsibility  Then they have to come back  With the work done  Really  Yeah  That's what they told me  Because I never did it  So they were like  Remember the stress  You felt going to school  To  I don't want my kid  Dealing with that crap  Yeah  That stress over  Nonsense  It was nonsense  In the end  Hours of homework  In your room  And you could be  Doing other stuff  That maybe you were  Interested in  I just did the other stuff  Nah  You were a good kid  You were a good student  For a while  Up to a certain point  You really were  You took it seriously  To like 6th grade  Something went wrong 
[01:49:00]  Pot  Actually something went  Right for you  Pot  You know  I don't mock you  For that at all  I think you took  The right path  He certainly did not  Take the right path  He happened to look up  And bump into you  What the fuck  Are you talking about  He took the drug addict  Be dead before your 40 path  God intervened  What's wrong with that  Everything  Because  That's a hell of a life  Yeah  No  Anthony happens to be  A comic genius  But most people are not  And most people  Even who are  Don't bump into you  Jimmy's  Jimmy's had it  Shit 
[01:49:30]  Look man  I'm getting close  To smoking pot again  So you know  I'm not saying that's wrong  Don't fucking  Encourage your kid  To be a nerd  Fucking  Bill Gates  Who's happier  Bill Gates  Or fucking  Rick the rebel  Who's now 45  And fucking  With a fat gut  And a horrible wife  I'll take Bill Gates  Or Steve Jobs  Or any other  Or how about that  Google Indian  Whatever the fuck  That kid's name is  Two billion  God bless these  Fucking geeks  I don't know where I'm at then  Because  It scares me man  Why 
[01:50:00]  Growing up  There was a lot of shit  I wanted to get into  But I was too busy  Doing three  Four hours of homework  Every fucking night  But like what  I don't know  You played basketball  You were athletic  I played a lot of basketball  Absolutely  But I don't know  I wanted to like  Do dumb stuff  I always wanted to be  Like a surfer  What are you talking about  I swear to god  This is stuff  Paddle out  He'd be surfing  Shitting as he's coming in  Sharks would be avoiding him  For miles  Sharks free zone  I wanted to be a surfer 
[01:50:30]  I wanted to do some music shit  What music  That's not  I was a drummer  I'm not that good at it  I'm not gonna sit here and brag  Oh gee  The nerve of school  To want you to do homework  And not pursue something  You were terrible at  No but I never had the chance  Because I'm telling you  I was bogged down  With a shit load  Of who gives a shit homework  I'm the only one  And you did it  No it was awful  Yeah because I had  Fucking really  I had a real strict mom  So yeah  Yeah I did it  It's annoying  But it's like  But I don't understand  What it did  In the end  Explain it to me 
[01:51:00]  It's hard to say  Because your direction  Was a weird one  I was really good at math  I couldn't do one trigger  I can't even say the word anymore  Thank you  Be careful  Yeah  Alright here's the advantage  I can't even say the word  And I used to be great at it  Okay here's what  What does it mean now  Math could help you  Because it strengthens  A certain side of your brain  Which helps you later  Like especially now  That you make a lot of money  If you're paying attention  To your finances  Being good at math helps  I don't even know  What a gallon of milk costs  But you know what I'm saying  No I understand 
[01:51:30]  What you're saying  I think it's out of control  Is what I'm saying  It doesn't give the average kid  A chance to explore  Other shit he's into  Yeah  And  Yeah  You know what it is  Maybe it's a balancing thing  I understand what Jimmy's saying  Because you're exercising  The brain and all that  And you're getting knowledge  I get that part of it  But these teachers  They're a bunch of  Fucking Hitlers  And they have to give you  The most homework  I wish  They have to give you 
[01:52:00]  The most homework  And you come home  I remember stressing out  In my room  Like how am I supposed  To get all this done  You gotta wait  And I want to listen  To a Zeppelin record  Or something  When do I get to do that  You gotta wait  Until they get old enough  You ship his ass off  To school  You wait until  He gets a little older  And can figure out  Like some things  That he wants to do  And then you gotta  Take it from there  And go oh alright  He wants to pursue this  Or that  Maybe he'll love  Fucking doing homework  And shit like that  Maybe  And maybe he won't  And then you gotta  Find other fucking options  When are you allowed 
[01:52:30]  To drop out  15  I don't know  My kid's gonna be  A lucky one  Drop out  Why not  Join the military  Why not  And then I'll get  Get him into something else  Put him in military school  Why not  We should do a whole show  On this  Where fucking people  Then need school  Yeah  I'm telling you  I'm so down on school  Are you  I really am  I have a lot of nephews  And nieces  And it's  I just look at this shit  It's a waste of time  And then I'm talking  To the parents out there  They know what I'm talking about  Half the fucking time 
[01:53:00]  And this is probably why  I brought this to the show today  The parents end up  Doing the goddamn homework  Oh really  You don't know about this  No  How would he  Mine didn't  For sure  The homework assignments  Sorry  Sorry there's beer  Spilt on my homework  My dad was helping me  The fist print in it  Some spaghetti sauce  You don't know about this  No  You go back to school  Alright  As a parent  No  As a parent  I was just gonna go  Yeah  Anthony gets a date 
[01:53:30]  And be arrested in a second  Sorry  You go back to school  The kids come home  With all this homework  They're stressed out  They don't know  What the fuck's going on  And you're sitting there  Doing their assignments for them  I'm telling you  I could take two hours  Of phone calls  That shit happens  Yeah  Like you wouldn't believe  I know like projects  And shit like that  Kid learning  Cause now the parent  Who's working his ass off  Just to fucking feed the kids  Is now doing the kids homework  He's learning how to  Delegate responsibility  When he becomes an executive  Really  Do this  I don't know what I'm talking about 
[01:54:00]  You do it  You're right  You do it  Yeah  He's like Biff Tannen  That's the parents  Who are doing it for them  They are shitty then  They should be helping a little bit  But not doing it  I wish you were right  It is happening across the board  You could talk to a million  The parents out there  They are all doing their kids homework  Or at least helping them out  A lot  Helping is one thing  But we're self  We're an indulgent country  And they indulge their children  And instead of saying  Look  I'll help you  But I'm not going to do it for you  They don't know how to say no  Anymore  You know  It's just  That's the easier way  Instead of hearing the kid get upset 
[01:54:30]  Right  They do it for them  It's the path of least resistance  Asian kids study all the time  And have no social skills  There you go  My kid's not going to become Asian  All right  He's not going to become  One of those Asian kids  See another guy  It's all about the Asians today  I hung up on three of these  And there's another one  That popped in his place  Jeff in Texas  Go ahead  Yeah  I was a nerd all the time too  And I kind of  I got into stuff too 
[01:55:00]  But the Asian kids  I mean  You say they end up being successful  But try and talk to some of those kids  Who  They go to tutoring  For four hours right after school  They have zero social skills  And  In the business environment  Social skills  Are just as important  If not more  Way more  But Asians in general  Don't have social skills  It's a different culture  But if you say that on the radio  Regular radio  You'll get fired for it  But the fact is  I've  You know  And now we're pissing off  Some Asians that do have  You know  Social skills  But in general 
[01:55:30]  Right  You're generalizing  When you generalize  A certain group  You know  They're not the funniest ones  Or the most entertaining ones  In the room usually  Right  Hey Dat fan  You ruined that show for everybody  Oh god didn't he  Everybody  Single-handedly  It's a terrible example sir  The Asians  Yeah  The Asians  No one  No one said you have to have a shotgun  At your kid's face  And make it  But it's like  You know  The idea that it's cool 
[01:56:00]  Why do they have to make school  This is something that I thought about  My entire life  Why do they have to make school  So miserable for the most part  Why  Why can't it kind of be fun  Why can't learning be fun  Why  Instead of a huge fucking textbook  About Russian history  Who gives a shit  There's not a way to  Exercise your brain  And make it a little more fun  For everybody  Okay  I hated going to school every day  Let me play devil's advocate  About Russian history  Which I don't know  Or give a fuck about  That's my go-to thing  You know  There's a million subjects like that  Their argument would be  Well all this history  And this nonsense  Is more important 
[01:56:30]  Because it lets you  Accurately know  Your place in the world  So as an adult  You have an easier time  Making judgments  And developing opinions  About what's going on  In the world around you  But if you're only taught  American history  Or if you're only taught  Look what happens in Islam  They're only taught the Koran  And they're a bunch of  Fucking psychopaths  Yeah  True  Good point  But then again  I agree with you on algebra  You're probably never  Going to need that  You're probably never  Going to need trigonometry  Unless you want to  Trigonometry  That's what I was going for  And I was great at it  You're never going to need that  Give me a basic  You know 
[01:57:00]  Problem right now  I couldn't do it  Couldn't do it  It left my brain years ago  You'll never need that stuff  I know  Unless you're pursuing something  That you need  Who wants to learn math  And go  Oh god  I've got to spread this  And teach it  What the fuck are you doing  Teaching math  You get a room full of kids  In a math class  Doesn't the teacher  Who's supposed to be  Experienced at this shit  Know right away  Who their bright students are  And then maybe  Push those towards  Science and all that crap  Anybody with round eyes  Out of the room  Oh yeah 
[01:57:30]  You guys really should  Beat me up about  The surfer thing  Why  It's a totally  Logical thing  To want to do  I don't know  I mean I'm just  Like I want to pursue  Other stuff  Is what I'm getting at  I really  Really liked music  Really liked it  Would have loved  To start a band  I didn't have time  To even figure it out  Yeah  When you look at  Most people  Let's play devil  Most people who've  Gone to college  And most people  Who've started bands  Who's doing better now  I would have loved 
[01:58:00]  To pursue  Some kind of music career  Oh yeah  Music is always fun  Yeah  Well the problem was  I wasn't allowed  To bring drums  Into my house  I had to  Practice on the pad  Oh I hate  What maxi  Yeah  Might as well have been  Sitting there  Tapping on a maxi pad  So I threw it away  I'm like well  There goes my  Drumming career  Because I can't  Play real drums  In my house  Because there's  Seven kids  Running around  Trying to find  The blue comb  It'll turn up 
[01:58:30]  Someday  Ah whatever  Probably just babbling  But just  Dumb thoughts  But I'm telling you  There are parents  Calling already  Saying yeah  I gotta do my kids  Homework  No you don't  I have to come home  From a fucking job  And do their  God damn homework  Well that's what you get  From fucking pumping  A load in someone  You gotta help them  But you don't have to  Do it for them  That's my motto  Oh yeah  And then the  Political correctness  In the school system  Thank you Paul in Connecticut  I don't want to put  My fucking son  Through that shit  Where they  Where they don't have  Valentine's Day  At school  And Mother's Day 
[01:59:00]  And Father's Day  And all that shit  That's the politically correct school  Yeah yeah  That's another  No it's every school  We're becoming a sanitized  It's just about every fucking school  A sanitized nation  That does not know  How to deal  With conflict  Or conflict of opinion  Or unpopular  It's really fucking bizarre  How we don't know  How to just tell each other  Well no no  That's not for you  That doesn't apply to you  It's like  Everyone's asked  For their opinion  The second you give it  You're completely chastised  For it  What are we doing  Yeah what is that 
[01:59:30]  Why can't you have  Especially Mother's Day  And Father's Day  Because if your parents  Choose an alternative  And I know that's not  The kid's choice  Family Day  See that's just a family  So it's  It can be  You know  Two daddies  Or two mommies  Why not just have  Mother's Day  And Father's Day  But if you are  If your parents are different  Why is  This is the problem  We don't know how  Because we're a country of dummies  We don't know how to teach people  That different doesn't mean  Better or worse  It's just different  So we make it look like  There's nothing different about it  And it is different 
[02:00:00]  Hallmark can't make  Cocksucker Day cards  Exactly  Heather has two mommies  And you show all  Heather's friends jerking off  Looking at her two mommies  Les out  Les out  I used to love  Saying that  Fucking les and out  They're les and out  I used to say that  Les out  You think they les out  Yeah you know  It's frustrating  I don't mean to be  I apologize  I'm supposed to be funny  No but it's  You know  They're not  They're not doing our  Our youth  You know  Any favor  The fact that 
[02:00:30]  The apologies  And just what  Just what a  And then the other thing  A whole nation of apologies  Yeah  I don't want to be sick every week  Because my kid comes home  With someone's fucking illness  Well that you have to deal with  Well no I'm not  Unless you lock him up  In his room  Throw away the key  Oh sorry  Let's say hi to Brian in Jersey  Brian  Hey  Good morning gentlemen  Hey Brian  How are you  Better now that you called  If you guys look  On the Bureau of Labor Statistics  That website  The top ten  I got it up right now 
[02:01:00]  Yeah thank you  Yeah  Who doesn't look at it  The top jobs  The first one's probably nursing  But everything thereafter  Is high school  Or vocational school degrees  There's really  For job growth anyway  There's nothing out there  That requires  Formal thousand dollar education  Well  And we brought to everyone  One thousand dollar education  Wow  I'm sorry  Jesus  Thousand dollar education  Style  Yeah where do you go to school  For that type of thing  Is that medical school  You're talking about  For a grand  In the Caribbean  Probably yes  And I think we were the first 
[02:01:30]  To bring it  Well not the first  But we had a great discussion  On the college degree  And  It almost doesn't make sense  To send your kid to college  Yep  And have either you  Or him  In a couple hundred thousand dollars  Of debt  Huge debt  When he graduates college  Yeah  If you don't go to college  You're two hundred thousand dollars  Ahead of the game  I don't know what college  Costs now  But I would assume  It's close to two hundred thousand  You're ahead of the game  And then you make your own way  With  College made sense  When it was a few thousand 
[02:02:00]  A year right  Yeah  Even like the basic schools  The tuition is way up there  What are they  Really accomplishing  I went to college  And learned how to drink  And I had a bill  At the end of it  Yeah I did that all on my own  And then I was paying my  I was homeschooled in that  Dude I was paying my  Thanks dad  That's why  See you understand  How rare that is  To be able to do that 
[02:02:30]  You know what most people  Would do when you said that  The drinking  Yeah you know  And then nothing funny  Would come out  Those bums  He happens to be able  To do that  Yes  Lucky for him  Because he was headed  To Flopsville  I had to pay back  Fucking college loans  For ten years  And I sat there going  Why  What did  What did I accomplish  At college  I guess I was able  To work at the college  Radio station  So I guess  I mean maybe  That was a complete  Waste of time 
[02:03:00]  What did you major in  Complete  Communications  Did you  And a computer  Computer minor  And all that went away  Computer minor  Oh okay  I love that  You don't have to write  Fortran and all that shit  You know that was a waste  Because all that went away  After you learned it  Is that computer  Computer language shit  Fortran  Wow  Is that like  DOS Prom  Turtle  Not it must be up  To like seven or eight  Tran  Turtle Pascal  I think it was called  I know how to do that  Turtle Pascal  Oh you do  You program computers 
[02:03:30]  What was after that  Because I remember  I can remember  Fortran  Cobalt  Might have been Cobalt  Turtle Pascal  In 85 or whatever  Well it was basic  Which was just basic  Then advanced basic  Don't forget advanced basic  That's where math helps though  I believe that side  Of your brain  It's working that side  Of your brain out  I'm not arguing  You gotta like  Work that side of the brain  But I think they just  Go overboard with it  Is just to generalize  My point  It doesn't leave enough  Time for these kids  To maybe see what else  They're really good at 
[02:04:00]  And by the way  That's all  That's my point right there  That's it  Simple  You know  Cause I think  Every teacher feels like  Oh we gotta give homework  Every fucking day  To these kids  And they don't  Cause the most  They don't have to  The most important thing  With fucking school  Is the social interaction  Dealing with people  Learning how to deal with  Disappointment  Learning how to deal  With fucking  What's that  Kids don't have to  Deal with that anymore  Everyone wins  I know  Everyone wins  You're not out there  But it's like just  Okay how about  You know  You like a girl  And you never ever  Get her  Right  Like you gotta learn 
[02:04:30]  How to fucking  The only way you get that  Is through social interaction  And at that age  The only place you're really  Socially interacting  Is school  Remember the valentine's day  What were they called  The little hearts  Oh the cards  That they would give you  But remember being in school  And rape invitations  Not getting any  But I  I was one of those kids  That didn't get any  But I liked being in the game  Thinking holy shit  This is fucking cool  What girl is gonna  You know  Drop off one of these things  In my locker  I remember never getting one  Right  From any of the girls  I liked  Did it 
[02:05:00]  Some slob would give me one  And I'd be all  Like I should have been gracious  What were they called  Valentine's  Yeah  Valentine's  And I'd be all mad  That it was a slob  That gave me one  Instead of being all like  Oh thank you  But did it affect you  Like I was all big shit  Did it affect you though  Yes  But I like being in the game  Nowadays  The kids can't do that  It affected me  Because everyone gets one now  It makes you who you are  Right  Which is a fucking  Lunatic asshole  Like myself  But no  It just makes you like  You're bobbing  Weaving  It makes you who you are  You adjust to what happens to you 
[02:05:30]  You need some hardship  Yes  And you need that social interaction  You need rejection  Yes  You need competition  All that shit  And it has nothing to do with  Going home  And fucking  Doing homework  School was more just  To be able to learn  How to deal with people  Because that's what you gotta do  Your entire life  If you go to school all day long  All day long  Why do you have to have homework  When you go home  Why  Again  To teach you the responsibility  Of doing something 
[02:06:00]  A little bit  Away from the workplace  By the way  You kind of said it  You said  Nobody loses  There's no unpleasantness  That same mentality  Which you're right  That's why parents  Are doing their kids homework  Because they don't know  How to tell  These are the same people  That are fist fighting  At a kid's soccer game  It's the fuck  It's these assholes  Who are also raised  No unpleasantness  No conflict  That don't know  How to tell a guy  Yeah you can burn the Koran  We think you're stupid  For doing it  But of course  You can keep your job 
[02:06:30]  Hey look  You can make that comment  About the women  Since it wasn't  A completely horrible thing  To say  We don't agree with it  But you can make it  Yeah  We're just babies  Now everybody goes  Oh  In mock indignation  They're not even shocked  Yeah  They don't even know  What shock is anymore  Because they all say  Nigger behind closed doors  If they don't say it  They think it  Nigger  They all agree  With this fucking guy  Women shouldn't be  In the locker room  Dressed like that  They all agree  But they don't want to say it  I open the window  And yell it like  I'm mad as hell  And won't be  You really are  I know 
[02:07:00]  Anthony opens the window  Every morning  And he's fucking  Frank Vincent  In Jungle Fever  You know what I mean  Even people don't say it  They think it  And once again  I can't even count that high  And like I said  I was good at math  In school  It was six  Just way too many people  For example  Uncle Sully  In Beacon Hill  I went back to college  At 28  Put myself in $115,000 debt  And it was a mistake  All my friends  With stable jobs  Never went to college  Another person  Is now $200,000 in debt 
[02:07:30]  For school  That didn't do shit  Might as well  Just take that to  The government  Should step in  And get involved  And try to  Make college affordable again  Because that  Has gotten completely  Out of control  Completely  That is one of  The biggest scams  Going on  That no one  Is talking about  No one  We do  We have a fuckload  Of  Bill Burr's here  Bill's here  Oh that's nice  Yes  To bring back  The fun  Really fast  Because it's quick  Ira  You know Ira  From Jay Thomas' show  That comes in  And says hi  Once in a while  No

[02:10:30]  What's up, gentlemen?  Hanging in New York, so he's got to come by and do the show with us.  Second Comedy Central special will air this Sunday for Bill Burr.  Let It Go is the name of it, and then it's going to be available on CD-slash-DVD October 5th.  BillBurr.com for all the Bill Burr info you need to know.  11 p.m. Sunday on Comedy Central. 
[02:11:00]  Yeah, let's all take a peek, please.  Support Bill.  And Bill was listening to us talking about college, and you're all in with this.  100% agree that it is the biggest, like...  No one's talking about it.  That's why.  It has become a scam in the last, I don't know, when it went through the roof.  If I had a kid, right, and he was going to college, I'd be like, look, just go to community  college.  Go there two years, and in the meantime, try to find some motivated, driven people with 
[02:11:30]  good ideas, and get with them, and invent something.  Start your own business, shoot a movie, whatever you want to do, rather than, you know, pay 100  grand to become a drone.  And it's like, you come out of school, you're like $100,000, $120,000 in debt, and if you go  in that route, the sheep route, just following the herd over the cliff, you're going to be  married within three, four years, and then you're going to have like a three, four, and  a thousand dollar house, depending on where the hell you live, on top of that, and you're  done.  You're on the fucking wheel until you're 65, you're going to wake up like, what happened? 
[02:12:00]  You're in debt.  Just chasing the carrot.  In debt.  In debt.  Yeah.  Hopelessly in debt.  And we're not even talking credit cards.  No, no.  Leaving college and owing 100, 150, you don't even have a job yet.  That's what Kevin Smith did, he was going to film school, and he had like 30 grand into  film school, realized instantly that this sucks.  I could have made a film for 30.  Well, that's what he did, he dropped the fuck out, got the money back, and made clerks with  the money.  Obviously, it's not going to work for everybody, you know, but still, in general, though, why 
[02:12:30]  not?  Bill Gates, another college dropout.  That's right, he did drop out.  He decided, fuck this, let me give this a whirl.  But if you really want to, if you want to continue your schooling, though, going to  community college is not a bad idea anymore.  People used to look down at the community people.  Community college?  They used to look down at those guys, but I think they're doing, you know, something  right.  You know, get the basic classes out of the way anyway, and then move maybe on to a university,  and then maybe only have two years of debt.  There you go, there's another way to do it.  But to sit there and just take it four years in the face. 
[02:13:00]  I mean.  Four years in the face.  Because somebody actually just wrote, yeah, but Kevin Smith got lucky.  Everyone gets lucky.  Yeah.  It's part of the whole game.  It's like, no, he didn't get lucky.  He went out and, he had balls.  Yeah.  He went out, he took the money.  Instead of going to school, he made a movie.  The movie hit, hit nerve with a lot of people back then, and took off, and that made a career  for him.  When it works, you have balls.  When it doesn't work, you're just an asshole.  You're an asshole.  I should have stayed in school. 
[02:13:30]  Pull yourself up by your bootstraps.  But with the basic kid, you know.  You've got to weigh that shit.  But there are a ton of kids in college who don't even know what they want to do.  As they're amassing $100,000.  I don't know.  I'm switching my major.  I was poli-sci, but now I'm thinking.  Maybe I'll be a teacher.  Maybe you're lucky enough that your parents are going to pay for it.  I had to pay for my own college, and there's a lot of kids out there paying for their own college.  Yeah, I paid for most of my loans.  So there's got to be a better way, is what I'm thinking. 
[02:14:00]  There's got to be.  You shouldn't blindly just graduate high school and go into college.  You shouldn't do it anymore.  Community college.  You really should think about it.  And then get a bunch of guys that actually have ideas and fucking bounce them off of each other.  And sleep on futons until you make it.  Live beyond your means.  Yeah, make the sacrifice.  Don't go get a man cave at 24, you fucking moron.  No credit cards, none of that.  I got a legit invention.  How do I move forward with it?  Are you an inventor with an invention? 
[02:14:30]  Do you have an invention?  Are you an inventor?  Just dial.  Don't you listen to this stupid station?  No, I don't believe in our sponsors.  What's the real way to do this?  What about the one that's on Rana Fest for fucking the balls?  For smelly balls?  Smelly balls, yeah.  Yes.  I heard that commercial yesterday.  I'm like, what the fuck is going on?  I want to present an idea to somebody.  How do I do it?  Whisper it to me.  No way.  I'm keeping this one close to the vest.  You know, there are a lot of companies that have these things for inventions and stuff, 
[02:15:00]  and I don't know how they work.  I don't want them to take all my money.  Exactly.  I don't know how they work.  I don't want them to take all my money.  This is what you do.  What you got to do.  You take some sort of tool that's in the kitchen, and you make it slightly more easier.  No, I got an invention.  Despite the fact that it already works.  Yeah, it works fine.  And then you just have one person not figure out how to use a can opener.  It's so difficult to scrape the skin off their fingers.  Make them look real stupid, and then make yours look real easy.  You know what was a great one?  In my lifetime, taking the cork out of the wine bottle, how they had that thing with the 
[02:15:30]  two legs, like some whore.  She spreads her legs, and then you drive the cork into her fucking twat.  Yeah, I love that one.  That thing there is genius.  Right.  Yeah, that was like the last genius invention.  But mine's a fun thing.  See, here's what you got to do.  You got to draw it up.  It can be a fun thing.  Draw it up.  I got all that.  Draw it up.  Oh, give a little synopsis to.  Who do I present this to?  Then you got to take it to the patent office.  Yep.  You got to patent that fucking thing.  All right.  So that's my first step?  Yeah.  And then what? 
[02:16:00]  You don't have to go through anybody, really.  Then you find a scientist.  Unless it's our sponsor.  Do I have to find a company, then, that is into my idea?  No, you find a scientist.  You just hang out in like a library and look for a guy with a white lab coat.  After that, you have to come up with some type of prototype.  It's a dumb...  Oh, that's easy, too.  It's a dumb game I invented that I think could do really well.  Yeah.  It involves shitting on the beach?  Well, it's a shit shovel for the beach that you put in your car.  So you don't have to walk five minutes to a toilet like a human being. 
[02:16:30]  He invents a bathing suit with a roll of toilet paper attached to the side.  You ever been on the beach and had to take a shit, but it was a five-minute walk?  Sure, we all have.  Sure, we all have.  The beach is the world's largest fucking...  Shitting at home is so inconvenient.  But the beach is the world's largest litter box.  Falling off a toilet.  Yeah.  Whoa.  It's a litter box.  Yeah.  I shit in a litter box.  It's in the box.  A giant litter box.  What did you invent?  It's got something to do with duty. 
[02:17:00]  I can't say, because then someone else is going to take it.  You're going to steal it?  I like my idea.  I bet it's a duty dicer, so you can actually feed it to the birds on the beach easier.  And it's better to try to figure out what I invented than to tell you.  It's a game, though?  Yeah, it's pretty cool.  Anyone who's played it is like, right on, man.  Right on.  It's a game?  You should do it.  Yeah.  Does it rhyme with Bic-Bac-Bow?  Very basic, too.  Very basic shit.  No?  I mean, tic-tac-toe.  That's old.  Oh, yeah.  Of course.  You want another Iris celebrity Twitter read?  No, I want to guess at this game.  I'm not going to tell you. 
[02:17:30]  What kind of game?  How about you can just wink at me?  He's going to invent I'm Not Sorry.  It's a meaner version.  It involves a lot of punching.  I'm Not Sorry.  There you go.  Why tell you when the guesses are better?  That's a great game.  Fresh Balls, greatest radio commercial ever.  Yeah, yeah.  Fresh Balls, it's called.  Do you believe in the sponsors?  Yes, wholeheartedly.  I do.  I believe in them.  I use them.  And I trust in them.  Maybe it's a new version of Monopoly where every property you land on, you step in shit. 
[02:18:00]  Boardwalk, there's big dewy under it.  There you go.  There you go.  If you pass call, you collect toilet paper or wet naps.  Keep a mediocre joke going, Jimbo.  I was trying to help you out in some sort of shit house for the jail house.  You don't want to help me out?  Tape over my mouth. 
[02:18:30]  Yeah, see, high school teacher called one of the...  Hold on.  Yeah, because I got to do the right thing with this.  Vinny in Jersey.  Vinny.  Hey, what's up, boys?  Hey, Matt.  I had a teacher in high school who told us a horror story about one of those 1-800 numbers  for inventions.  Right.  He called one in the 80s and he had an invention for the locking system for the car mat, that  little plastic piece that holds them in place.  Oh, that keeps it from sliding on you.  Yeah, exactly.  And he found out two years later, after nothing happened with this 1-800 number, that the 
[02:19:00]  company, the 1-800 number was just stealing the inventions and selling them to, like, big  manufacturers and big companies.  Yeah, see, that's why I'm scared.  Yeah, you've got to watch.  All of a sudden, you call someone and go, oh, that's a dumb idea.  You go, oh, all right.  And then you see it in stores five years later.  Yeah.  That's what scares me.  In, like, 1989.  Maybe my dumb thing is stupid, but I don't want anyone ripping it off.  You're pitching it.  Maybe my dumb thing is stupid.  Yeah.  What game could this be? 
[02:19:30]  Yeah, like, another guy, actually, a corporation probably made all the money, was that stupid  thing, you know, when you hold your phone between your shoulder and your side of the face.  Oh, yeah, that thing.  That little attachment that goes on your shoulder and looks all silly when it's sitting on the  cradle.  And then there's horror stories of guys who worked for big companies and invented stuff  while they were an employee and couldn't reap the benefits.  Oh, all the time.  All the time, right?  Yeah.  I'm trying to remember one.  I think it was the post-it note or something some guy invented while he was working for 
[02:20:00]  a company and he couldn't, he didn't get a dime for that.  That and all the way back to that guy, Tesla.  I think it was the post-it.  Tesla got fucked, yeah.  Yeah.  He's crazy.  I guess the dude was crazy, but, you know.  Right.  But if you invent something while you're working for a company, during work hours especially,  you're fucked.  That's when you need a really good friend who can pull it off.  What the hell is the neck basket?  Yeah, moron drunk friend.  I invented it.  The neck basket, it's what they hand you when you join Islam. 
[02:20:30]  In case you ever interpret it as being an infidel.  Good, explain.  Yeah, that was a fake infomercial, yeah.  But it's very much, it's not that far off, believe me.  You could actually sell that thing.  Yeah.  They make everything look so inconvenient.  I forget what part, what commercial this is really for, but I was watching it.  It starts off looking like one of these ads and like, the first time I saw the Snuggie,  I thought the same thing.  Like, all right, when does this turn into the joke?  Yeah.  And it never did. 
[02:21:00]  And the first time I saw this, I was thinking the same thing.  I'm like, all right, when does it turn into the joke?  Because this could totally be sold.  I could see this.  It turned into the joke when they had the XXL.  Extra, extra large.  Well, this is like the full length one.  Like, there's a short one that, you know, it's like 25 seconds and then it goes into  the real commercial.  I love these commercials.  They're ridiculous.  Yeah, I've sat and watched infomercials, though, for the entire length of them.  Of course.  I'm just fascinated.  Have you seen the one for those, like the $6 binoculars, where if you put them up to  your eyes, you could see like China and Japan. 
[02:21:30]  See things 55 miles away.  There's no way that's ever happening.  As a comic, I did a warm-up for fucking the Home Right paint stick, which was an  infomercial.  Wow, the paint stick?  And I was the warm-up.  Is that the one that you push and it's like a big needle and like a syringe of paint in  the handle?  It's like shooting heroin into your house.  Yes.  And it goes onto the roller.  And I was the warm-up.  They had like, you do warm-up.  It was like a six-hour day.  I was very new in comedy back then, a couple years in. 
[02:22:00]  You're like, this is a big break.  Dude, I was fucking, I was bombing so bad.  The crowd, no, this is not the one I, wait, dude, that guy Jan did it, that guy who does  all the infomercials.  And I was bombing so bad, I wound up just talking to the crowd because I just wasn't funny back  then.  So like, well, we'll keep up on your career.  It was so humiliating.  Oh, wow.  That's pretty bad.  I don't think this is the commercial.  Home Right paint stick.  What the hell is that?  It looks like it, but I mean, the infomercial was, you know that guy Jan that did a million 
[02:22:30]  of them and that chick, you'll know them as soon as you see them.  They're failed, whatever, but successful at that.  I think I know who you're talking about.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Home Right paint stick.  I have two ideas.  All right.  Are you going to give them away?  No.  Fuck no.  All right.  Good.  And I'm never going to develop them either.  And I'm going to be bitterly talking about them in my 80s in some bar.  That was you.  It finally comes out.  Yeah.  That was me.  And then you realize something like that was invented in 76, which is called something  else. 
[02:23:00]  Yeah.  If somebody brings that up and actually has the evidence, you're like, ah, that's bullshit.  You guys never like me.  It'd be great to invent something really creepy, like wipes that will remove all DNA evidence.  That's convenient.  Tired of leaving semen on a stomach?  I'm sure, but down the spy shop.  I thought you had an angle there.  No, I didn't.  I did have an angle.  Jimmy.  Straight to bomb.  It was an arrow pointed down. 
[02:23:30]  I just love the disappointment in Jimmy's face sometimes.  I know.  He really does get disappointed.  That's okay.  It doesn't even allow it to sit there and let us decide.  He just gets disappointed right away.  I know.  Ah, whatever.  I got to figure out the invention thing.  You know, we should all get together and just throw in all our, I'm not even bullshitting,  all our 1995 ideas.  We'll take the best one out of the hat.  And go for it.  And just go for it.  Just go for it.  Yeah.  I'll make up a shitty idea just to get on your guys' bandwagon. 
[02:24:00]  Come on.  Yeah.  We sell a zillion of them.  We all come up with something shitty hoping somebody else comes up with a good one.  We all just have shitty ideas.  Yeah.  My brother came up with an app.  Really?  Yeah.  A good one?  He did an NDA and everything.  A good one?  You think it is?  He went to the company.  What category would it be in?  Utilities?  It's way too fucking photography.  Which brother?  Scott.  Pretty smart guy. 
[02:24:30]  Yeah.  Oh, I know what it is.  You sold that really well.  You're like, my brother came up with an app.  I'm like, really?  And you go like this, you go, yeah.  I was like, shit.  I want in on this.  I want in.  How do I get in?  Dude, it's good.  That's how you should pitch it.  It's so good.  He got so paranoid.  He made this company that he went to, which is a big time app company.  He signed an NDA.  And then he presented the idea and they went, holy shit.  Right.  Dude, that's the way I'm going to pitch it.  I'm telling you.  Next TV show.  I got an idea for a TV show.  Really?  Bring me in there.  Yeah. 
[02:25:00]  Yeah.  Just look at the guy.  Oh, yeah.  You just suck him in.  He's pretty excited about it.  There's two guys.  One guy's neat and the other guy's a little messy.  Really?  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  My brother sold me on it, though.  I went, wow.  Dude, you sold me.  I don't know what the idea is.  I can't say anything more because it's very early.  And who knows?  It might not go anywhere.  But this company went, yeah. 
[02:25:30]  Damn.  Oh, yeah.  They got a team and everything now.  It seems like it would be so easy to come up with a good invention.  But it's kind of hard.  If you could come up with a good app, I mean, who knows what happens with my brother.  It's probably a creepy app.  It's called the Jew Detector.  Oh, okay.  I'm going to the app store right now.  Dude, if you.  What did Twitter add today?  I just saw that on TV.  Photos and are they doing like a.  Yeah, photos and videos, I think.  I haven't checked.  Yeah, because their Twitter.com site sucks.  So now what?  That's terrible.  That site's going to have pictures and videos? 
[02:26:00]  Yeah, they want to make it a little more marketable.  Right on, man.  No, but if you come up with a good app, that is the fucking.  Yeah.  It's the future.  It's not the future.  That's financial freedom, my friends.  Financial freedom.  If you come up with a good app.  Yeah, then they sue you, and then there's taxes, and then you're that angry guy who's  just left with 40 grand.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  I don't know.  It's got to be something.  Yeah.  I always think it's got to be something so easy. 
[02:26:30]  That's what I think all day long.  Come up with some stupid invention to make sure your mustache isn't crooked.  Like it doesn't go further down.  Just some stupid mustache level.  Yeah, I know.  Are you shaving everything, like your head and stuff?  No.  Okay.  Yeah, because Stan's confused yesterday.  Oh, I paid too much.  Why would I shave my hair off?  I'd love you to try to, and it just won't cut.  You didn't see that?  It's uncuttable?  It's like fucking wire? 
[02:27:00]  Razor wire?  That fake putting green grass?  No one knows what my game is.  I'm not even going to the phones just in case you come close.  Nope.  I don't know what your game is already.  Oh, jump to conclusions?  What?  No.  Oh, where are you going?  Thanks.  Oh, the penis towel?  I wish I invented the penis towel.  What is it called?  The dick towel, right?  Oh, yeah.  You can get that on funny for one second. 
[02:27:30]  Dot com.  But you know how many towels they must have sold by now?  The dick towel?  Come on.  Huge cock.  That can't...  Is that real?  It was part of Always Sunny.  Yeah.  It was like an in-show thing.  Derek has one.  Does he?  Yep.  Yeah.  It started out as a joke, but I bet you they're making real money, though, off the dick towel.  Oh, yeah.  The website crashed the first time.  Okay, so there you go.  Fucking T-Boy had to get one.  What an ass. 
[02:28:00]  Why wouldn't you get a dick towel, Ant?  Because it's silly.  Exactly.  What's wrong with being silly?  I don't know.  It's not the kind of silly I want.  Yeah.  I'd get one if it was black.  You know, it's a little different.  I didn't even know that that came from the TV show because I wasn't watching the show,  and now I do watch the show there, Danny.  I had no idea.  Yeah, dick towel.  I had no idea.  That was part of Always Sunny.  I'm way behind, though.  Also, kitten mittens.  Look at that poor cat.  For all your kitty needs.  That poor fucking cat has little mittens on, and it's just... 
[02:28:30]  They don't like walking and those things.  That guy is the first...  They just hate things on their feet.  That guy's the funniest guy on TV, by the way.  Poor fucking cat.  After we watched this in the back office one day, I think we spent the next hour and a  half watching animals with shit on their feet because it's just too goddamn funny.  Why is it so fucking funny?  I know.  They all walk like...  They walk like Blair's cousin, Jerry. 
[02:29:00]  Wow.  Poor fucking animals.  How do they get away with this without getting complaints?  I have a feeling they do get complaints, but Always Sunny kind of doesn't give a shit in  general.  That's why I like that show.  That is fucking funny.  I want to see that video that Bill mentioned about the kid...  Oh!  What do you got?  Kid with the...  What do you got, Bill?  Air horn?  No, this really fat kid who E-Rock said looked like John Panette is sleeping on the couch  and his brothers come over with an air horn and just blast him right in the face with 
[02:29:30]  it.  E-Rock should have said, the kid looks like me.  Looks like E-Rock.  He shouldn't be making any fucking...  No, no, he's right.  Watch when you see this kid.  All right.  Yeah, this is Sean, and we're about to blow an air horn while I'm sleeping.  Let's check that.  Let's check it out.  Oh, wow.  Oh, okay.  Big fat kid just got walking up.  Get away from me, you idiot! 
[02:30:00]  He's got a big glovin' t-shirt on.  God, stop recording it!  I'll let you out of your hands right now and I won't pay for it!  Oh, these little fat legs are kicking.  He's so fat! 
[02:30:30]  Stop recording it, Andrew!  Don't delete it!  Don't delete it.  It ends up on fucking...  Now he just starts watching TV like a little whale.  Just laying there.  God, don't you hate fat kids?  Oh, look at him.  He's kicking at the camera.  She can't read.  She can't read.  Okay, stop.  Oh, he's getting up.  Oh, you're right out of your head!  And you'll pay for it.  Uh-oh.  He's gonna throw... 
[02:31:00]  He's gonna kill you before he tries to kill you.  Just do it, do it, do it, do it.  Those little metal briefcases are going...  Don't delete it!  They did it on purpose!  Tell him to delete it.  They like to annoy me!  Do it again.  And to give me headaches!  Give me headaches!  And to annoy you!  This kid's great.  Sean, stop recording this! 
[02:31:30]  Sean!  Mom!  Mom!  Holy fuck!  That is great!  That kid's fucked!  These poor kids, their childhood is over.  Done!  Who didn't have that moment?  Your older brother's picking on you, losing your shit, and your mother never comes to your defense.  No.  Kids fucking torturing you, and she's yelling rum, you know?  Michael, stop that! 
[02:32:00]  I like how he's yelling, delete it, and now it's everywhere for everyone to see.  Yeah, that's a classic example of why you have to just roll with the joke, because then it's only, you know, 15 seconds long.  And it's over.  If he just would have went, ah, stop.  Yeah.  They wouldn't have put that up.  It would have been nothing.  No one would watch it.  Now it's hysterical.  It's like Clemens.  If he's just like, yeah, yeah, I roid it up.  Yeah.  Yeah, what do you want?  I'll take 100 victories away.  Yeah, I did it.  Stop saying I did roids! 
[02:32:30]  Stop saying I didn't say that!  Ah, with his big, fat face.  He looks just like Panette.  That's a good call.  Yeah, it is a good call.  All right.  Chubsy, Ubsy.  I had electronically signed something yesterday, and now I just got an email that it wasn't accepted.  What the fuck?  Why do they have to make everything so complicated in this world?  Why can't you just have it mailed to you?  Well, because that's too easy. 
[02:33:00]  Or faxed.  You have to go through a whole process to get a password, a customer ID, to get your electronic signature official.  I don't know.  Yeah, and then what they're going to do is they're going to have...  I help tell dick jokes.  Why do we have to deal with this shit, Ant?  They're going to sell your electronic signature, and then if you ever try to come after the Illuminati,  they'll just have this piece of paper with documents that I am a Nazi, and they'll just stand.  They'll have it.  Yeah.  The Illuminati can just forge it.  Ready for this?  This is what I got.  This is what I got. 
[02:33:30]  Hi, Opie.  The filing was not accepted because...  That's the best anybody's ever taken out one of my dumb theories.  The Illuminati.  I think I just forge it.  Hi, Opie.  The filing was not accepted because it did not have a valid user ID or password.  That's right.  Well, you're not valid.  You're not valid.  I'm valid.  You're not.  Apparently not.  I went through the process yesterday.  You were valid.  It would have went through.  If it wasn't validated properly.  It would have went through.  Ant, don't make fun.  You've got to do one of these, too.  I'll just laugh.  Wait till you go through this shit.  You know what?  Wait till you go through this shit, Ant. 
[02:34:00]  Where did you have to...  And then you won't be making your jokes.  Where did you have to electronically sign it?  On your phone?  I don't know.  Where did you actually sign something?  You don't sign it.  What do you do?  It's an electronic signature, but you're not actually signing.  But then what do you do?  You get the...  Do you type your name in?  You get a valid user ID or password, and then that is your signature, I guess.  I don't know.  I had to deal with this for an hour and a half yesterday with a crying kid on my lap.  Is that...  Iraq? 
[02:34:30]  Is that...  After he woke up with an air horn in his face.  Wait till you have to go through this.  You won't be making your jokes.  Is that something I'm going to have to deal with?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Within the week.  Really?  Do you have a user ID and password?  I don't even know what to put that is.  For an electronic signature?  No, I got it for...  This is what the government's doing now.  I got it for Mr. Skin.  This is what the government's doing now.  Does that work?  No.  I'm sure there's some conspiracy behind this, right, Bill?  I was watching the dog with the socks on his feet.  We should all be watching that.  The dog with the socks on his feet. 
[02:35:00]  I'm just bringing nonsense.  He's goose-stepping.  Yeah, just prancing down the street.  That's great.  I like how they can't think to just...  If you just had one on, it would actually bite it.  Yeah, yeah.  But if you give them all four, it's just overwhelming.  They freak out.  It's just system overload.  They don't know what to do.  Their legs move independent of their brain at that point.  And they just can't function.  Oh, the poor thing.  I feel bad for animals.  We used to do that.  No, you didn't, Chip.  You're lying.  Yes, we did.  You lie.  We did it with cows.  Put nails in their feet. 
[02:35:30]  Chip makes it very mean-spirited.  Right in their ankles.  They don't have ankles.  Fig, though.  I don't know.  They have fetlocks.  Cows are dumb.  How would you know that?  I was raised around cows and horses.  Were you?  You were a farmer?  No, I was a little equestrian kid because my dad wanted to be a cowboy at fucking 35 years old.  You might have seen the video of his father in Seattle with the horse.  He has a tragic end.  I grew up around horses. 
[02:36:00]  They don't have ankles?  Out in Orange County, as a matter of fact.  There was horses down the street.  I never knew anything about their bone structure.  No?  Yeah, I just know you grabbed a handful of grass.  Hey!  Hey, you fucking horse.  Get out.  Yeah, fuck you, too.  Yeah, they're just too fucking...  People trust them too much.  It's like, let me just get up on this fucking giant animal's back and ride it.  Yeah, that you had to break. 
[02:36:30]  You were always getting fucked up.  No matter what, the horse could have been a docile horse, but somehow you were falling off of that.  You knew if you rode horses more than just going to a rent string or, you know, once a fucking year.  If you owned a horse and rode, you were fucking getting thrown off of that thing at some point in your life.  And it's not fun.  Oh, absolutely.  Oh, the thing would see something scared.  I like baby wild animals and how people, they're so in the mindset that it's a baby.  That they're not really looking at the size of it. 
[02:37:00]  That was that day when they brought in those baby tigers.  When you got scratched.  They go, do you want to hold this thing?  I'm like, you out of your fucking mind.  I don't want to get scratched by a house cat.  That thing's got this refrigerator Perry-sized paw.  Four of them already.  Yeah.  It fucking nailed me on my leg and my arm.  Did it hurt?  It's a little fucking tiger.  Fuck, it hurt, right?  Yeah, it really left like a big fucking scratch down my arm.  Or even they would see like a little colt galloping around.  Oh my God, if that thing kicks you.  It's adorable.  That little colt leg.  It's bigger than a Great Dane.  It's bigger than a Great Dane, but because it's not as big as a horse, people get in that mindset. 
[02:37:30]  It's a baby.  And they see because it's a baby, but the muscle on the leg is like Tyson's arm in his prime.  The fucking one kick and you are done.  And I got into an argument with DeRosa yesterday.  I'm crashing with him, right?  And about orangutans.  We were watching Cannonball Run Part 2.  Tony Danza's in the back of a limo really driving.  And they got an orangutan driving.  And Don Knotts pulls him over.  Great movie.  Don Knotts pulls him over with Tim Conway. 
[02:38:00]  And they get into this throwing shit at the orangutan.  And it's throwing shit back at him.  And I was like, Joe, I wouldn't do that fucking scene.  What are you talking about?  And I go, dude, I wouldn't fucking miss it.  Because you're an idiot.  Oh, I said he was an idiot.  Because we were saying that.  I like the way you immediately gave Joe the horrible part.  Joe, call me a piece of shit.  Oh, wait, that was me.  No, he was saying.  He goes, no, he goes, only chimps do that shit.  I go, dude, are you out of your fucking arms?  Look at that thing's fucking arms.  Oh, my God.  Look at Danny.  Oh, here it is right here.  He finds the clip in a second.  What, look, look, watch. 
[02:38:30]  Danny found another language version.  Look at how it just grabs your head.  Fuck that.  That's probably the same orangutan from every which way to loose.  Totally.  Do you know how strong those fucking things are?  That's what I was trying to tell him.  I said if that thing wanted to, it would rip your arm out of your sock like you were made 
[02:39:00]  out of Play-Doh.  And they just beat you with it.  Just beat you with your own arm.  A pit bull, you have a pet pit bull.  They could just rip your fucking arm off.  But this is the difference, though.  That's a domesticated animal.  It's an animal that could be domesticated.  This is a fucking wild animal.  That's the exact argument that he brought up.  Look at it.  It's fucking smacking him in the head.  Now, how do you know this thing isn't going to get amped up as you're having your little  karate fight with it?  All of a sudden, it just reverts back to its jungle behavior.  Tony Danza and Mel Tillis, by the way, are in the back of that truck. 
[02:39:30]  Tim Conway and Don Knotts.  Come on.  Don Knotts funny every time.  Don Knotts is doing it like a karate fight with the orangutan.  Wow.  This is great comedy.  It fucking stinks.  The only way I would do that scene is if the trainer had a gun to that orangutan's head.  Just CG, CGI, whatever the fuck it is.  Just get it out of there.  A green gun.  It's just a green fucking painted green. 
[02:40:00]  There's no way.  Take it out in post.  This has all the classic laughs, you know, cheap laughs of late 70s, early 80s.  They have not only an old lady giving the finger, they also have a monkey giving the finger.  Giving the finger.  That is funny.  Nothing funnier than an old lady going, up yours!  She did the fuck you one, and then she drove through the window of a dealership, of course.  Oh, hysterical.  It's a bad movie.  Well, Cannibal Run 2 answered all those questions from Cannibal Run 1. 
[02:40:30]  It's bad, Bill.  Oh, my God.  Well, first of all, it's directed by a stuntman, so there you go.  Is it a Hal Needham?  I don't know who it is as well.  I think it's a Hal Needham production.  But they actually wrote a Cannonball Run song, and there's one montage.  I swear to God, it's like 15 minutes of them just playing this song, desperately trying to make it a 90-minute movie.  Just, Cannonball, Cannonball, and they're showing every fucking car on an individual shot going over a bridge. 
[02:41:00]  It's like, I got it.  There's a race.  Cannonball, Cannonball.  It's like, are you trying to say they didn't have enough material, Bill?  Oh, yeah.  They needed 90 minutes to get it in theaters?  Oh, Burt Reynolds was just starting to get fat, so they kept, because Joe goes...  And they had the wig on, right?  I don't even know they made a second one.  And Joe goes, why do they have him dressed like Han Solo?  It's like, because they're trying to hide his gut.  They got, like, this vest over him.  Shirley MacLaine, right before she got old. 
[02:41:30]  Cannonball, Cannonball.  I can't remember, it's fucking horrific.  And they're just showing the cars.  You should see the cast, though.  It's ridiculous.  Telly Savalas.  Wow.  Dean Martin.  They got everyone for that one.  I was like, Burt Reynolds is...  Sammy Davis Jr.  Dom Gulliwiz.  Dom, of course, is in there.  Yeah, Dean Martin.  And a bunch of cars.  Cannonball.  Burt Reynolds.  Oh, this is the song.  I think this is it.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah. 
[02:42:00]  It's a car movie.  Sammy Davis Jr.  A couple of wise guys behind us.  Slow down, let's see how balls are there.  Jamie Farr.  Jamie Farr?  That's a couple of great-looking chicks.  So much for Burt Reynolds.  Let's nail them.  Cannonball.  How bad is that looping?  You can just hear them in the recording studio.  They're supposed to be in the car.  Yeah, there's no sort of ambiance that you're in a car. 
[02:42:30]  Cannonball.  Cannonball.  Cannonball.  Cannonball.  Ha, ha, ha, ha.  It's not what you do, it's how you do.  You feel it, you want me.  It's not what you got, it's how you do.  Yeah.  You be you and I'll be me.  Oh, damn.  I feel it at 155.  Yeah, that's crazy.  Changing the sign like that.  That's great.  Isn't she from the Duke of Hazzard?  Oh, yeah. 
[02:43:00]  And Shirley MacLaine.  Everybody.  Shirley MacLaine gets the end?  Wow.  And roar.  From sea to shine every sea.  And cannonball.  They speed up the footage.  That was so badly done.  It's like 1920s footage.  They're speeding up the footage to make it look like they're going fast.  Yeah.  Oh, shit.  That was not really fast.  They cannot run the radio.  Charlie, you got a hot one.  Head in your way.  You'll see it in about three minutes.  In alphabetical order, Susan Anton. 
[02:43:30]  A couple of great looking chicks.  That's what's wrong.  Yeah, they didn't even try to make it sound like they were in a car.  Oh, no, it's terrible.  And none of this makes sense.  They're driving a white Lamborghini.  Now the cops are coming after them so for so.  They're in the middle of fucking nowhere.  Driving 155 miles an hour, evidently.  Yeah.  Right?  Sid Caesar, Foster Brooks.  This is what we're talking about here.  Jackie Chan.  Wow.  Young Jackie Chan, yeah.  I don't know.  It's time to be on a board. 
[02:44:00]  Yeah, they're using the old gun.  It's the greatest thing I've ever seen.  Cannonball.  Cannonball.  They end up pulling into a construction site.  And without having to talk to anybody, all the construction workers start spraying the car.  And the white comes off and it turns red.  And then they get away.  Oh, there you go.  Yeah, look at that.  Right.  Just that classic.  What if it would have fucking rained?  This is stupid.  This is stupid.  It's really, yeah.  It's really childish to pick apart a movie as shitty as this, but it's fun.  Yeah, how did they know that they had to do that?  Frank Sinatra was in this? 
[02:44:30]  Yeah.  Joe Theismann?  What woman did Frank beat in this one?  Star-studded.  Star-studded.  Abe Vagoda.  Abe Vagoda.  They have like three out of four guys in the mob scene were all from The Godfather.  You can hear them bitching about their agents in between takes.  Cannonball, cannonball.  So we gotta get this Burt Reynolds.  I tell you, boy, something you won't think I've been drinking.  Oh my God.  That's just the intro.  It's gone on forever.  It's endless.  Hey, we got Ira doing more celebrity tweets. 
[02:45:00]  Wow.  Oh, yeah.  Sorry.  I was just hypnotized by that clip.  I'm trying to move on, because we gotta take a break, then we gotta get Marc Maron in here.  Yeah, because I have a Cialis rod.  Really?  Music, get it.  Cannonball.  Cannonball.  All right, yeah, get it out of your head.  I challenge you.  Nah, ain't gonna happen.  Cannonball.  Our new friend Ira, the weatherman from Jay Thomas' show, we love the guy.  Oh, yeah.  He comes in on Fridays, usually. 
[02:45:30]  He's the best.  New bit where he reads tweets of very famous people.  And I believe he's doing more of 50 Cent here, maybe.  Fitty?  Little Fitty?  Yeah, he's doing 50 Cent actual tweets.  Reading actual tweets from Fitty.  And now, Ira the weatherman's celebrity Twitter readings.  On today's episode, Ghetto Philosopher, 50 Cent.  If you're a girl that would ask your man to wait with you till your period goes away, 
[02:46:00]  you're going to lose that man.  My advice, suck a dick, LOL.  This has been another celebrity Twitter reading from Ira the weatherman.  LOL.  LOL.  LOL.  People tweet shit like that?  Yes, they do.  Yeah, the bigger the celebrity, the dumber the tweets, it seems.  Kanye's good, though.  Oh, is he?  Yeah.  Kim Kardashian wrote yesterday, insomnia.  That was it? 
[02:46:30]  Yes.  What reading her tweets cures?  Boring fucking fat-ass whore.  Who would I love to eat her ass after a good shite?  Really?  Yeah?  You like to get in there?  Yeah, she's a good shite.  And then we had Imus talking about us a little bit today.  Indirectly, because our pal Rob Bartlett works on that show.  Yeah.  I guess he was late today, so Imus was a little pissed.  That's why we're not on the radio in Washington.  Uh-huh.  We're not ever going to be number one anywhere.  I mean, that's not the kind of show this is. 
[02:47:00]  But why wouldn't you want us on the way?  Yeah.  I mean, you can sell the hell out of it.  And just for the prestige.  Yeah.  You might actually get to meet me.  Yeah.  Please.  That would be the downside, but.  Yeah.  You just get to work?  Okay.  Here's the deal.  Yes.  If you're ever late again.  Yes.  Call Opie and Anthony or Howard.  Okay.  Thank you.  Thank you.  I'll go back there and get busy.  All right.  That's just outrage, isn't it?  He sounds terrible at this.  What?  That's rough. 
[02:47:30]  How's that body?  That's rough.  I don't mean it.  If you're ever late again, call ONA.  I don't mean it.  Oh, my God.  Do you think that's what's going to happen?  You know something?  How long has he been with us?  You know something?  25 years.  You know what I think?  What?  I think that's going to happen.  I miss that.  It's really bad.  I'm depressed now.  Oh, late you are.  Late you are.  You're going to have to.  Oh, and then you will go, too.  Jesus Christ.  Sounds like Yoda, Ant.  Like, ha, ha, chip. 
[02:48:00]  You're going to have to update your I miss impression.  I can't do the old I miss anymore.  It's, uh, oh.  I miss in the morning program it is.  Yes.  Call us, you will.  Late you are not again, you will be.  Or you will end up on the Opie and Anthony or Howard show.  You will.  Oh, oh. 
[02:48:30]  I am not I miss you look for.  No.  Oh, fired.  You will be.  You will be.  Aw.  That sucks.  How about his voice?  I hope he just sounds like I got a cold or something.  Hate to think, you know.  That's more than a cold.  That's the new I miss voice.  Maybe he's got MRSA.  Of the larynx.  Are you glad we cleaned the studio for you today, Bill?  Absolutely thrilled.  You're all in with this MRSA thing and we shouldn't avoid it. 
[02:49:00]  I am anti-virus.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Fucking infections.  So is his company.  God damn Jimmy, man.  It's not going to get better than that.  We'll be back.  The virus.  Can you give me an example of what you're talking about?  This is the Opie and Anthony show.  If you see me getting high, if you see me getting high, knock it down.  I'm not going to lie.  If you see me getting high, if you see me getting high, knock it down. 
[02:49:30]  I'm not going to lie.  Old school red hot chili peppers.  Yeah.  Got Bill Burr in studio.  Billburr.com.  The big plug for Bill.  Comedy Central special.  The second one, Bill?  Yes.  For Comedy Central.  Sunday night at 11 p.m.  Check it out.  And then it'll be released on CD and DVD October 5th.  On Comedy Central.  What happened?  Did I say Comedy Central?  Yeah.  On Comedy Central.  Comedy Central.  Bill Burr. 
[02:50:00]  Sunday night at 11 o'clock.  Thank you.  And with that, we also say hi to Mark Maron in studio.  What's up, Mark?  Hello, fellas.  Hello.  How's it going?  It's going.  It's nice to see you.  Is it?  Yeah.  It's been a while.  I don't even know how long it's been.  How long has it been?  A few months?  Because I don't know.  You know, when you don't live here, I don't talk to you enough.  I don't know what the hell I talked about last time.  I got some problems, but I'm all right.  Some problems.  What do you mean you got problems?  Nothing bad.  Here's where I'm at.  I'm on the fucking subway.  I'm on the fucking subway reading this book. 
[02:50:30]  Letting go of anger.  Oh, boy.  I'm a guy sitting on a subway.  You don't want to be next to that guy.  Yeah, but I'm reading this book, and I know people are looking at me, and I think they're  judging me, and there's part of me that wants to go, what the fuck are you looking at?  I just started it.  I just started it.  I think it definitely depends on how far into the book you are.  When I look at that, I almost bought that off the Kindle.  I just didn't buy it.  Did you really?  Yeah, but I had a problem with my account.  Yes.  Anger issues are terrible.  So you know where I got this?  So you threw your Kindle against the wall?  Can I ask Mark something? 
[02:51:00]  Listen, is this a prop, or are you really reading the book?  Dude, let me tell you.  I'm reading this.  Because it's so huge.  I'm going out with a 27-year-old lunatic, and I thought, after all these years of just  fucking girls spitefully at my ex-wife and not connecting with them at all, that I was  somehow or another that this anger issue that destroyed my second marriage was gone, that  I had outgrown it.  Right.  So as soon as I meet a woman who I open my heart to, right, because it's completely chaotic, 
[02:51:30]  if I meet a woman, and somewhere in the first five minutes she says to me, my father's a  fucking asshole, I go, I'm your God.  I can be your father, and you can have sex with me.  But all right, so this is that girl.  So my heart opens up.  Wait, I've got to slow you down.  What?  Just a little bit, because you came in here a couple months ago.  I'm sorry, man.  And this was a fan or something, remember?  Yeah, this is that one.  And you were in love, and everything was going pretty well.  I am, but this is what it looks like.  This is what love looks like.  That's what love looks like.  This is what love looks like with me.  Reading a book on anger and... 
[02:52:00]  Yes.  Horrible.  And the sad thing is, a fan sent me this book.  I get this book in my P.O. box, letting go of anger.  The card just says, this book helped me a lot.  And see, it breaks it down into 11 kinds of anger.  So the card just says, this helped me a lot.  I'm shame-based anger.  Oh.  That's what the guy wrote.  Did you find out what kind of anger you were?  All of them.  You're every single one.  Can you loan me that afterwards?  Dude, if you read it, you're not going to have an act.  Yeah.  The act is over. 
[02:52:30]  But, God, we should all walk around New York City with that book.  You would stay out of trouble.  Who's going to fuck with you if you have a letting go of anger book hanging from your back pocket?  I want to read the dedication to my family, who I beat for a long time.  To my family, fuck them.  To my family, sorry about that.  Exactly.  I don't know.  It's just gotten out of hand.  As soon as I get this girl, it's just gotten out of hand.  What is this girl doing to you?  I don't really know what the hell it is, but it just seems that when I meet somebody and 
[02:53:00]  I let them in a little bit, my heart just becomes this fist.  And I just want to keep punching them with this.  With my heart fist.  Hit it with your heart fist.  Yeah, that's it.  You ever heard of that?  Yeah, of course.  I'm just like, I'm just lashing out.  She's driving me nuts.  You know, she's chaos.  She, like, as I learn more about her, I don't know if you've dated this woman, but the woman  whose room looks like a nest.  Like, literally, there's just clothing everywhere.  It's just a bed covered in clothes and there's shit all over the floor, right? 
[02:53:30]  Not just on the floor.  There's food cartons on the bed.  And the only thing that makes sense on that bed is her vagina.  Just that's the only thing.  The rest is just chaos.  Chaos around the vagina.  I just don't have the patience for it.  I'm not that.  I'm 46 years old.  I'm not like, you know, this is like, I want to fuck in a restaurant.  I'm like, I'm too old for that shit.  And I don't even know how you would do that.  Be sticky.  Not in a good way.  I'm tired.  You know, I'm a little tired.  I didn't ever think I would say that. 
[02:54:00]  Does it bug you?  Like, the clothes all over and stuff?  Do you go like, I clean this shit up?  No, but that's the anger.  You can't say that because I don't want angry at that part.  But does it even bother you, though?  Not really, because I'm not living there.  Oh, so then who gives a shit?  Why do you care?  You got some OCD in it?  Maybe in my head.  In my head, Anthony, that I think, like, maybe this one, I'll have a baby with her.  You know?  Oh, no.  Oh, wow.  Yeah.  Dude, I'm every kind of anger in this question.  I know who you are.  Of course you are.  That's so...  Bill, read through the chapters, will you?  All right.  Or the actual anger. 
[02:54:30]  Yeah, I want to hear the actual anger.  All right.  Sneaky anger.  Showing anger by doing nothing.  Just sitting there simmering.  I've seen those.  I've seen those.  You have all of these.  Anger turned inward.  Becoming the target of your own anger.  I've done that.  Sudden anger.  This one I don't think anybody has.  Blowing up without warning.  No, no one in this room.  No, I have that.  Why is everyone looking at me?  I'm going to take a break.  Shame-based anger.  You guys have fun with this.  Shame-based.  Yeah, turning shame into rage.  Done that.  Oh, wow. 
[02:55:00]  That's called getting heckled when even you knew the joke stunk, too.  That's exactly it.  Deliberate anger.  Becoming mad to get what you want.  I never use that one.  I've done that my entire career.  You're a horrible person.  It's my career in comedy.  I can't even read the word.  What do you mean?  Habitual?  Excitatory anger.  That sounds good.  Getting angry because you can't read what the fucking word is.  Habitual hostility.  That's getting high on anger, by the way. 
[02:55:30]  That's a big one, Bill, that you just read.  Getting high on anger.  Getting high on anger.  It is a rush.  Yeah, absolutely.  Well, that's the issue.  And that's the problem I'm having.  All right.  Let me blow through the rest of these.  Habitual hostility.  Looking for reasons to get anger.  Paranoia.  Feeling attacked by everyone.  Moral anger.  Defending one's beliefs and values.  I never do that.  Oh, my God.  This sounds like your...  Resentment.  This sounds like your CD credits.  Exactly.  This is the track list of my next CD.  Long-lasting anger about old injuries. 
[02:56:00]  I don't hold on to shit.  Conclusion.  Letting go of anger.  Conclusion.  How to hide a body.  I don't know about anybody else, but I think this book just changed Bill's wife.  I think you're going to get this book, aren't you?  Yep.  They had the little quiz at the front.  Bill, don't do it.  I just put yes on all of them.  Yeses on all of them, right?  All yeses except for like two.  I'm annoyed by the quiz when I am.  Wait, give us some questions.  Let's take the quiz.  Okay, so anger styles quiz.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Beliefs.  Anger styles.  Okay.  So they break it into styles of three questions each.  So I guess this is... 
[02:56:30]  No!  So this is the anger avoidance questions.  Answer anger style quiz.  One, I try never to get angry.  Yes.  Absolutely not.  I get really nervous when others are angry.  No.  No.  No.  I'm feeling I'm doing something bad when I get angry.  No.  See, so none of you guys are really anger avoidance.  No, no, I'm crazy.  I'm exactly the opposite of everything you just guys were saying.  Do you avoid anger?  Yeah, yeah.  I don't like anger.  I avoid it. 
[02:57:00]  I get nervous.  Really?  When anger is around in any way, shape, or form.  You're just a quietly faggot.  Wait, you don't avoid anger, though.  I'm a faggot.  You ever talk about taxes with you?  You don't get avoiding anger.  You're fucking hunting it out with a fucking...  Yeah, but they talk about justified anger in here.  That's like the belief thing.  Like Jimmy pointed out.  Anger at no improv skills, chapter 12.  I should write that fag.  The belief anger, that's like preaching my bullshit.  That, like, if somebody doesn't see my point of view, as I'm really believing that I'm making valid points, I'll start getting, like, worked up. 
[02:57:30]  I don't know if it's anger or passion.  That's barroom anger.  Barroom anger.  Well, that's every anger for me.  Dude, I'm telling you, they got satellites.  They're fucking looking at us.  But that's right.  It says that there is healthy anger.  It doesn't say you can't be angry.  But the thing I do, though, is like, I know, I don't know, do you, are you a rage person?  Like, if I start getting angry, and I know it's coming, there's that moment where you're like, fuck, dude, just don't do it. 
[02:58:00]  Don't put me over the edge.  Yeah, yeah, just let's move past it.  And in my mind, I'm saying that.  It's like, it's not that big a deal.  It's not that big a deal.  Next thing you know, I'm like, what the fuck is wrong with you?  And then it's over.  Then you've done the damage.  My type of anger goes, I could take a lot of fucking shit before I blow up and start, like, yelling and cursing and that stuff.  And the prime example would be Waltz in The Godfather, when he's like, Tom, you should have told me who sent you.  Hey, have something to eat.  And he's just, as he's talking, he's just getting more and more pissed. 
[02:58:30]  Now, you get the hell out of here.  Tom didn't say a word.  Tom's just eating.  You guinea mick.  And he's telling his story.  And he's just getting more pissed as time went on.  That is exactly what I'll do.  No, you'd get mad for the reason Waltz did in the book, that there was a 12-year-old up in the room waiting.  Anyone seen the director's cut?  Oh, yeah.  Is that true?  Yeah.  Jack Waltz, when that party that Robert Duvall goes to to first meet him, when he goes, I admire your picture very much, he was regaining a starlet, a pony. 
[02:59:00]  And in the book, they reveal she was 12, and she was crying up in a bedroom.  So when Tom was leaving, he looked up in the bedroom and realized that this guy had fucked that 12-year-old.  Jesus.  Kind of made it a little easier.  That makes it a different character.  Yeah.  No kidding.  She was the greatest piece of ass I ever had, and she had no pubic hair.  And I had him all over the nursery.  Oh, fuck.  Oh, my God.  Got it out?  Sure did. 
[02:59:30]  So the anger book's helping you, Mark, obviously.  That's good.  Well, it's helped me a little bit.  You know, I did have, like, I'm just surprised that it's all back, because I really thought I'd gotten past some of it, but I think I was just stuffing it down to the point where, you know, I seem to understand.  I think, like, I was at Delta going to Atlanta a few weeks ago, and I was on a TSA line for fucking two hours, and I'd never been on one that long.  And they were understaffed, and, you know, it gets to that point where you're like, just let the fucking terrorists on.  I don't care.  I mean, I'm willing to gamble it's not my plane.  You know what I mean? 
[03:00:00]  And then, like, I'm just starting to get very hyper-aware of my thought processes, because actually, Patrice brought this up.  He kept telling me, like, when I was talking to him, that I'm in my head too much, so now I'm, like, hyper-aware of what the fuck is going on in my head.  Oh, what's going on in your head?  Oh, you've got to get rid of that shit.  Well, no, but how can you live in the present?  Everyone's like, you know, live in the present, live in the present.  That's like, so that's like, you want to be a retarded person?  I mean, you can't.  What does being in the now mean?  Like, ah!  I mean, what does it mean?  A lot of my anger is I anticipate fuckhead moves by other people.  You make shit up, in other words. 
[03:00:30]  No, but it usually ends up happening.  Like, that whole security line, I was waiting for you to be like, yeah.  And then the person in front of me is complaining about how long it takes, and then they wait to begin their disrobing process and computer-taking-out thing until they're there.  Then, oh, how many bins do I need?  It's like, or rubberneckers.  I want to fucking shoot all of them.  Have you ever seen a body?  Yeah.  Is there ever a headless torso laying in the road?  Sometimes.  It's the most inane.  But here's what happened there at the line, though.  I literally took two hours.  I'm about to miss my plane, and I'm pissed, and I'm at the bins, and the TSA guy comes up and taps me on the shoulder. 
[03:01:00]  I turn around, and there's a wheelchair guy there.  And he's like, do you mind if we?  Yes, I mind.  Right, there's part of me that a good person would have just said, oh, of course not.  But then I'm thinking, like, is that a real wheelchair guy?  What's the credibility?  Because I've seen guys get up out of the wheelchair and walk through the fucking security.  Yeah.  So I'm literally saying that.  What kind of asshole am I?  Is that a real wheelchair guy?  And then he fucking gets up and walks through it.  Oh, you're just one of the lazy ones.  Why should you miss your flight? 
[03:01:30]  Because old turnip legs didn't want to fuck him.  Wait in line.  I treat those lines like, it's like a fucking game show.  I can't do things fast enough.  And just, I don't know why, I get all fucking tense and nervous at the security thing.  Not because anything's going on, but I can't work that quickly.  It's the shoes, it's this, do I have something in my pocket?  Is the thing going to beep when I go through?  Do I have my ticket?  Where's my shit?  I want to keep an eye on the, got to take the laptop out.  And then getting everything back together after it comes out. 
[03:02:00]  You don't want too much shit piling up behind, so I just freak the fuck out.  Yeah, you've got to move it.  There's a process.  We travel a lot.  Yeah, you take all the medals, you stick them in the jacket, you're going to take off, right?  So you got that, you stick that in the bin, you got your computer bag ready to go out.  If it's warm.  You leave your shoes on until the last second because the floor is fucking dirty.  Disgusting, right.  So at the last second, but you take your shoes, you put those in first.  Shoes come out first, you put those fuckers on.  Yeah, and then your computer.  So then you got that in your hand, then the computer bag comes, you stick that in. 
[03:02:30]  Jesus.  And then, yeah, I try to lead by fucking example.  That is good.  And these morons.  That is good.  I sat down on the benches.  I sat down on the benches.  It was an invention.  It was an intelligent thought.  I'm just as fast, but I am a mess.  I'm just, ah, I'm grabbing shit, I'm limping over to the fucking bench to sit down, to push  everything back.  Pockets turned inside out.  It's just like, I look like I've been mugged, yeah.  I feel like it's awful.  And then you realize after all this stress, you've saved a minute.  It never takes that much longer. 
[03:03:00]  Yesterday, I went to the bench.  Collectively, the whole line.  Look, I'm getting angry right now.  Fuck them once I'm there.  Once I'm there, I'll peruse a book while I'm there.  Fuck them.  Once I'm in the bin, they can go fuck their mothers.  And I'm 20 people behind him going, look at this motherfucker with this book.  I'm Kenny Casual.  Always.  I had broken up with this girl by the time I got to the airport yesterday at five in the  morning.  I break up with her every other day.  You know, so that's the kind of relationship we're having, where you're just like, fuck  you, get out.  And then about a half hour later, you're like, all right, come back and fuck me. 
[03:03:30]  And then like, oh my God.  And then like the day.  It's a little volatile.  Well, it's volatile.  It's completely ungrounded.  But you know, that kind of sex is the best kind of sex in the world that kind of, you  know, like I, I used to always think that cause I used to fight with my ex-wife that  the kind of sex you have on a pat, like a pile of clothing that has been taken out of  a dresser to be put in a suitcase to leave you is the best kind of sex that you can have  because, because everything depends on it.  But I, I keep breaking up with her and, and she keeps breaking up with me and it's just  ridiculous. 
[03:04:00]  So I get to the airport at the only reason I'm bringing this up.  It wasn't just to derail the conversation.  I get to the airport at four 35 in the morning.  I'm exhausted.  I'm punchy.  She was supposed to pick me up and she didn't cause I knew she'd not wake up cause she's  on her pile of clothing and she couldn't find her alarm clock.  And, and I get to the airport and you know, when you're on those really early flights and  everybody looks like they just woke up and there's some vulnerable and weird about it.  Like you kind of feel like you just had a slumber party with everybody who works at the place.  You're like, Hey, how you doing?  You know, and I just woke it up. 
[03:04:30]  And like, I just broken up with this girl cause she didn't pick me up and I had to drive  to the fucking airport and I barely made it.  And I won't, I go through the security thing and I, for the first time ever, I didn't race  to put my, to try to beat my trays.  I actually sat on the bench and I'm sitting on the bench and put my shoes on.  This woman sits next to me and it's that weird waking consciousness.  And it's like, I'm looking at her and like her hair still looks like she had just gotten  up and she looks kind of soft and vulnerable.  And I'm thinking I could go with her.  Like literally I'm at the airport. 
[03:05:00]  I've been broken up with the girl for a half an hour.  I'm like, I'm just going to go with this lady with the matted hair.  She seems really soft and nice.  And I get on the plane.  I never think, uh, like I think I'm better than, uh, uh, some people, you know, I think  like, uh, I'm beyond sexism and all this shit, but like there are these moments that  happen where I realize I'm, I'm just as I'm fucked up.  Like I'm on the plane, the plane takes off, dude.  And we're in the air and the pilot comes on.  Hi, this is your pilot.  Uh, we'll be traveling at 30,000 and it's a woman.  The pilot is, but I had that moment where instinctively I went, Oh, can she do this? 
[03:05:30]  You do.  It's like, Oh God.  Like, is there a man up there to help her?  Aren't those controls heavy?  I feel like such an asshole.  Is she going to freak out her emotions?  She's putting her lipstick on.  She fucking broadsides a barn.  Stupid whore.  Pay attention.  For Christ's sake, get ahold of yourself.  I'm sort of ashamed of myself for thinking that. 
[03:06:00]  I'm ashamed of you if you're not getting off that plane.  I want something with a cock and balls up there.  It's not a cunt pit, is it?  You know how funny that would be if you just stood up the second you heard the voice like,  Oh, no way.  I ain't having no broad flying me off the damn ground.  So it would have been really weird.  Land this fucking plane.  Jesus.  You should have yelled out, You didn't say it was a woman.  Is there a guy up there?  And then you should have at least said, Please just tell me, what color is she? 
[03:06:30]  Oh, God.  I had that happen, too, recently.  The racial profiling thing, which I always think I'm beyond and above.  That was fucking embarrassing.  I was coming back from Ireland.  It was like I'd done the 12-hour jump, and we're in Chicago.  We're flying to Chicago to L.A., and I'm exhausted.  I've been up 16 hours.  I'm starting to hallucinate.  So I go back to the bathroom, and there's a guy there that's a questionable tone of brown.  I didn't know.  It wasn't one I was necessarily familiar with, and I decided in that moment that it was probably Palestinian. 
[03:07:00]  He was probably Palestinian or Egyptian, and I'm standing there at the bathroom.  I said, Where did God this happen?  And I really fight this shit, and I know that I'm like, Dude, what are the odds?  I mean, come on.  You're being a fucking racist idiot.  But he looks at me.  I look at him.  He doesn't go to the bathroom.  He starts walking in the front of the plane.  I'm following him.  Like, I have to take action.  It's a big plane.  Take him out.  Right.  So I'm following him, and then I get to where the flight attendant's area is, and I'm panicked  because in my mind there's shit going down. 
[03:07:30]  He keeps walking to the front of the plane, and he disappears into the front first-class  cockpit area, and I must have had that look like we're in fucking trouble because a flight  attendant looks at me and goes, Are you okay, sir?  And I'm like, What?  And I look at her, and she's like, Are you okay?  I'm like, There's a situation happening in my mind right now.  Who the fuck says that?  There's a situation happening in my mind.  You don't want to say that on a plane.  So I'm like, and she goes, Well, say that on the ground.  Yeah.  So she looks at me like, Okay, could you just take your seat? 
[03:08:00]  Everything's fine.  And I sit down, and here's what I think is happening.  I have a completely fear-based imagination.  I think this guy is in the cockpit with specially treated toxic gloves, and he's now touched  the necks of the pilot and the co-pilot, and then they're going, And foam is coming  out of their mouth, and he's pushing them aside.  He's in the cockpit, and he's going to fly the fucking plane into something, right?  Yeah.  That's what's going on in my head.  That's the situation in my head, and I'm panicking a little bit, even though I know  this can't be happening, but I'm committed to it.  And then all three flight attendants come up, because she had obviously gone back and 
[03:08:30]  told them.  They all come up to me and go, Is everything okay, sir?  And I realize, Holy shit, I'm the problem.  Now you're the problem.  Yeah, and I'm the fucking freak.  And I said it again.  There's a situation going on in my mind right now, and I'm just a little panicky about it.  And they're all surrounding me, and then I see the dude walking back.  You know, the guy who I thought was now flying the plane just walks back.  He'd just taken a round.  And at that moment, I realized that I had lost the war on terror.  I had lost.  You were the guy's danger.  Yes and no, though.  Because it's like, you don't think that when something is happening. 
[03:09:00]  You're like, why the fuck did I just say it?  You don't say it, though, to a flight attendant until you hear, like, Allah Akbar and some  bashing over the door.  Yeah, you could have said it a little bit, but I'm worried that that guy who looks Palestinian  in my mind is going to try to take over the plane.  But I didn't want to commit to it.  So when I was sitting down, because I was sitting right in front of the flight attendant's  area.  You were movie vague.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Were they purposely vague in movies?  So the guy goes, what?  Yeah, yeah.  And I was holding onto a metal top that I was spinning to make sure. 
[03:09:30]  But so when they were landing, the flight attendant was facing me in that seat, like, I was right  there.  Yeah.  And she goes, are you feeling better?  I'm like, yeah, I just had a situation in my mind.  Again, I said it.  She goes, that happens to all of us now.  And I'm like, oh.  Oh, maybe she knew.  Maybe she knew.  She knew exactly what you were doing.  She knew.  She was following.  Because she was probably looking at the guy coming up, too.  Yeah, it was just ridiculous.  And you're following, so she's probably like, there's two of them coming.  We got two.  Well, I think you were his fucking accomplice. 
[03:10:00]  The accomplice is the other one.  You were the Chechny and white one.  They're really brutal.  We have, though.  Like, I was on a, I had a black pilot on a plane, and that shouldn't bother me.  But I'm like, why do I care, you know, if I'm on a plane that's being stolen?  I mean, it shouldn't have bothered me.  See?  Oh, yeah.  We were more racist.  Flying out of Tuskegee.  How things were you guys' relationships?  Everything all right?  Yeah.  Got any, nothing?  Sure.  Everything's good?  I almost had a physical incident recently.  With her?  With her?  Yeah.  We didn't, though. 
[03:10:30]  So you're the same as me?  What?  Now, okay, Gene.  So you're the same as me?  You're a rageful fuck, or what?  It's frightening.  It scares me how angry I get over nothing.  Over what?  Nothing?  Nothing.  It doesn't scare me with his Hulk sneakers that he has on.  They are green-bottomed shoes.  Hulk sneakers.  And you can't stop it, right?  No.  Now, why?  I don't want to stop it.  What was the problem where you don't want to say?  It's just, it's genuine, general bullshit arguing.  Misunderstanding.  It's like what Mel Gibson was mad at. 
[03:11:00]  Because your feelings get hurt, part of it, or it could be because I'm being a baby, or  it could be because I'm not getting, it could be one of anything.  It's an excuse to go there, because it's a control thing.  Wow.  And it's safe, and it keeps it, I'm afraid of dullness.  Like, I don't like dullness or boredom.  But wait, let me ask you something.  Why are you on this show?  Because I'm contributing to the dullness.  Or in a relationship.  Can I ask you something, honestly?  Because, like, I went back to fucking therapy because of this.  And it's weird when you go to therapy, like, and you're 46, because, like, I know what  my issues are. 
[03:11:30]  And you walk in to therapy, and I'm like, look, I'm probably, I'm not going to be able  to unfuck myself.  All right?  Well, let's be honest.  I can't be idealistic.  I mean, you can't fix me.  I'm more than halfway done with this life thing.  Can we temper the shit that's destroying my life a bit?  Can we just tune up a little bit?  And she's looking at me like, I guess.  All right.  Very logical, though.  Yeah.  But, like, with me, the anger thing is, is when, when, let me ask, do you, do you feel  better when she cries?  No.  Not in the moment that she does?  No.  I feel nothing.  Like, I'm a fucking, I'm a sociopath, and I argue, I almost feel like it's a movie. 
[03:12:00]  And her emotions, what I'm saying, mean nothing.  Really?  Wow.  They mean nothing.  Wow.  Literally, I can say horrendous stuff.  And this is any girl I've ever dated.  It doesn't matter to me how they feel.  It's, I'm disconnected from it.  And it's like, I'm a loving guy.  So no matter what she says, you don't give a, like, you're, you're hurting me.  It's like, I don't care if I'm hurting you.  You're garbage.  Jimmy immediately thinks you're trying to, let go of my arm.  It doesn't feel real. 
[03:12:30]  Jimmy's thinking you're trying to steal the scene when you start crying.  You're trying to fucking upstage me.  I'm going to go bigger.  It doesn't feel real.  It's not that old.  Because you're in that elevated anger place.  It doesn't feel real.  And then when they get really upset and you finally come down from your anger, you're like,  are we okay?  Everything good?  I mean, you're like, guys.  Wow.  Like, I do that all the time where you get angry.  And then once you, it's like coming.  Like, once the anger is done, you're sort of like, all right, can we move on with our day?  And she's a broken mess.  Holy shit.  I've actually felt, as fights have happened, this is with every girl I've ever dated, 
[03:13:00]  like, I felt like, as they were crying, I'm like, you're supposed to be feeling something.  You should not be so disconnected from this.  Like, I know it's wrong.  Yeah, yeah.  Because the person's crying.  You feel, yeah.  But it's literally just, it's a total disconnect.  It isn't that I don't care.  But it's because I'm not spiritual.  That's all it is.  It's simple.  You know, it's corny, but it's better to understand than be understood.  And I don't want to understand.  I want to be heard, and that's it.  And go fuck yourself.  I don't find it spiritual.  Like, I just feel horribly guilt-ridden the second a girl pulls that crying stuff. 
[03:13:30]  Pulls it.  The second a girl has feelings.  Because of my, yeah.  They aren't the ones I wanted to have.  When they pull that shit.  No, to me, it's just another strategy to win.  That's all it is.  Really?  Yes, it's almost like a running back crying because a defender goes left when they go left.  That's what I feel like it is.  That's why you can't connect, because there's parties that think like that.  Oh, that, you're going to do that now?  Yeah.  This is how you're going to play it?  It's about winning.  It's not about two people who care about each other.  It's a control thing.  You're right.  I've done that.  I've called out my girl when she's cried and said that this is just so now you can win. 
[03:14:00]  And there's times I still feel that I was right.  But there's, you know, it's one of those things.  You cave in because she's crying?  No, I don't do, like, look, I try to be like this.  If I'm wrong, you know, I try to immediately apologize and say you're right.  Sometimes I'll defend myself, you know, hopelessly for like five, ten minutes, and then I'll be like, all right, you're right.  But like when I'm right and I call you out on something like, you know, just dumb shit. 
[03:14:30]  Like, how come I keep, I always have to keep doing these dishes.  You're never doing the dishes, but just stupid shit like that.  And then somehow it escalates to you're crying.  And then it's just like, yeah, I'll be like, look, this is ridiculous.  Okay.  I've done the dishes like the last eight days in a row.  You haven't done them.  But now you're crying to make me feel like I'm this bully.  Yeah.  Go to your room.  And then as I'm talking like this, then it'll be like, why are you yelling?  And it's like, this isn't yelling.  This is yelling.  Yeah.  This is yelling.  This is a high, this is a, you have tonal issues. 
[03:15:00]  You're not, you're hearing it.  Why are you yelling?  You're not yelling.  When you're not yelling, when I'm talking like this, and when I'm being told that I'm yelling, it's like, I'm not yelling.  I'm not biting myself.  I'm not, you fucking idiot.  Yeah.  It's amazing how it all becomes jockeying for positions.  I'm seething.  Seething.  I'm not yelling.  I get very guilty if a girl starts crying because of an argument or anything.  I, I really don't lose it very often.  Um, I can't even describe when I would, it's, it's like with the ex-wife, I would lose it. 
[03:15:30]  Yeah.  Because I had no, I could give a shit at that point.  Oh, with it during the process.  Yeah.  Fuck that, whatever.  But now it's just like, even if I know I'm right, I'll just go like, you know, I just  got to cut my losses.  That's awesome.  What's the meanest thing you've ever said in an argument to, to a female?  Ooh.  It's a great one.  It's gotta be the ex-wife.  I'm your boyfriend.  Yeah.  It's gotta be the ex-wife. 
[03:16:00]  It was something to the effect of, you know, then get the fuck out because I'd rather fuck  her.  Oh yeah.  Yeah.  There you go.  That's a wrong one.  I never, I never do the name thing.  I never do, you know, bitch cunts.  Oh God, I do.  I never do that.  Oh no.  I start with that.  Yeah.  Me too.  Yeah.  With a cunt.  They have to be capitalized because they're proper names.  Sorry.  One of the meaner ones I did, this girl started crying and I was so annoyed by saying, oh,  fucking grow up.  That's bad.  Grow up.  Grow up.  Yeah.  I'm not your fucking father.  That was my late twenties, early thirties, you know, and I had that level of anger. 
[03:16:30]  And what you were talking about before, I don't like makeup sex.  The whole myth of, wow, you're mad at each other, you argued, and now you, you just  like, you stopped arguing, you got your shit together.  Let's have this passionate sex.  No.  No, because I'll still not like you.  But that, but that's.  I'll be like, no, I'm, I'm not liking you right now.  No, I want to face you.  I want to be facing you.  You're pushing the face in the pillow.  No.  Everything's okay, baby.  We're back together. 
[03:17:00]  It's not.  That's part of it.  That's part of it.  That's part of it.  That's part of it.  Yeah.  It's just, I, I want to continue not liking you.  I got to wind down from the argument and the bullshit that we had before I could be passionate  with you.  Right.  I really think it's about, you know, ripping everything down, destroying everything.  Everyone's raw and fucked up in the, you're tired from arguing.  And then it's like, you just, it's this primal union, man.  No, I don't see it like that.  Yeah.  Some people could see it like this fucking and yeah, you mother, we argued and I see it 
[03:17:30]  like, you can start like that, but I'm not very attracted.  I'm not going to say it to you right now because you're a fucking cunt still.  And I, you were cunt five minutes ago and we're in the very new, now it's supposed to  be all nice.  Unless you're into, you know, fucking choking sex and shit like that.  I just, I, no, not unless they, they asked for it specifically.  Yeah.  But then it's awkward.  I have one woman asked me that.  You can choke me if you want.  And I'm like, I didn't even know how to do it.  You know what I'm saying?  You sit there holding a woman's neck while you're fucking going, is this good? 
[03:18:00]  Is that a yes?  You want to stop?  Some kind of forensic files reenactment going on, you know?  I just, I am embarrassed about arguing in public because I, I've been that guy in my  life.  That's the most embarrassing.  I don't know how many times you've had, like if you've been in a parking lot or a shopping  ball or somewhere where another guy, you're having the thing with your chick and another  guy comes up, looks at her and goes, is everything all right here?  Oh.  That fucking moment?  No.  I've never had that.  Oh, you got to try harder. 
[03:18:30]  I've been, I've been this clenched teeth guy going, don't make a fucking scene.  Oh no, I'm making the scene.  I turn into a ventriloquist.  Don't make a fucking scene.  Don't make a fucking scene.  I swear to fuck.  I am going to just walk the fuck away and leave you right here in the store.  I'm going to drive home.  Don't make a fucking scene.  Okay, you cock, you fucking cocksucker.  So I, I can't stand like when, when I try to keep shit in house, even like with our apartment,  like cause it's an old building.  The walls are so thin.  And when she gets going, like I always say, you don't, you don't have to yell it that 
[03:19:00]  loud.  Why don't you just let all the neighbors know what the fuck is going on?  I think what the funny thing is, is they think I'm hitting you and you're in here after  you're fucking hitting me.  I'd like those fucking, I'm going to look at the fucking asshole.  Whisper, whisper arguments.  I have yelled.  Everyone's going to look at you like you're the victim.  I've yelled in my house, yeah.  Clean up your fucking shit.  We used to yell in my neighborhood.  You can't talk to me like that. 
[03:19:30]  Shut the fuck up.  I never, never whisper.  Greg, Greg, why don't you call the cops?  Just call the cops and get it off with.  I used to have these horrible arguments in a quiet neighborhood to the point where I got  embarrassed when I'd go outside because I was sure that neighbors could hear.  Yeah, and I, you know, literally I'd see my neighbor on the street.  We'd be taking our garbage out at the same time.  I had moments where I had to stop myself and go, I'm not hitting her.  Let me just hit this one off at the pass here.  I'm not hitting her.  They don't know.  Here's the guys one that got yelled at me.  I, I, I, I, it was, it was accidental. 
[03:20:00]  My girlfriend one time, I was arguing with her and she had moved her hand or whatever  and I, I blocked, I just, it was a stupid thing and I cut her with my nail by accident.  It was like a minor thing, but it wasn't an aggressive thing.  It was like one of those stupid things.  And then we're yelling at each other and then she's walking out, she goes, and why don't  you trim your nails, you're always cutting up the inside of my pussy.  Shit.  Jesus.  Point her.  That's nice.  Oh, that's a good one. 
[03:20:30]  That is great.  So Mark, you still, you're going to break up with this one?  I don't fuck, I break up with her every day, man.  And now, and I don't know what the hell to do.  I really don't know what to do about it because I can't help the fact that I have feelings for  her.  Like I, the, the, the last few I've dated, I didn't really have them in that way.  What does she think of you?  Like, what does she think of you?  Has she gotten any of the revelations over the time you've been together?  Like, holy shit, this guy was sweet and now he's yelling at me.  She knew what she's getting into.  She basically stalked me and that's how we met.  I think I talked about it the last time I was here.  And it turns out that like, I'm, I'm kind of stuck because she used to, as a job, work 
[03:21:00]  with severely emotionally disturbed children.  Jesus.  So like, I, that's, you lose.  Right.  That's who I am.  You fucking lose.  Like, I'm going to scream and yell and she's like, you know, just doing this psychological.  Right.  She's putting up with it.  Exactly.  This is a day at the office for her.  Exactly.  Oh, shit.  So like, I'm, I'm really stuck and then she feels bad.  No, obviously if we're together, we're wired to be fucked up like with each other.  Does she hold a clipboard during your argument?  Checking off things and taking notes?  Just during sex. 
[03:21:30]  She holds a clipboard.  No, but I, I don't, I don't really know what I'm going to do only because like, you  know, there's no, there's no real trust there.  And I've never had a woman say this to me before.  Cause like, when I like somebody, when I, and I thought this was gone too, when I get emotionally  connected, the jealousy starts, you know, I get nuts, you know, and this is after dating  that dominatrix chick who was her job was to, you know, spank and stick things into  sad men.  Right.  Yeah.  So, so the, uh, it, I put up with that, but, uh, but this one, the first time I left town 
[03:22:00]  and when we were together to go on the road, she just said to me, she says, look, you know,  you've never been on the road since we've been going together.  I just want you to know that if you fuck anybody out on the road, I'm going to fuck  people, you know, Oh, Oh, so like now there's this negotiation in place.  Like, okay, we were incapable of trust or intimacy, but now we're just, we have this weird  warnings out there.  Yeah.  Like there's some sort of threat, mutual assured destruction.  Dude, you just saw the tip.  She's going to burn down the village. 
[03:22:30]  I think so.  When this one goes south, dude, just stop.  If you want to stay in it, stop telling her your secrets immediately.  Wow.  You know what?  I, I, I kind of felt that.  Yeah.  No, I'm not telling her mine.  I'm telling her everyone else's.  No, I'm kidding.  I, I just, I, you know, I, I had that feeling that like there are moments of vulnerability where  I'm like this, cause when we get in fights, you know, she like gets vicious.  I mean like mean and she hits, you know, she gets a few in.  Oh yeah.  I got one of those.  Yeah.  Oh man.  Really?  Yeah.  Oh yeah. 
[03:23:00]  Everyone, they, they, they call it passion.  I'm passionate.  Passionate.  You're fucking hitting me.  They're making a list of weapons they can use.  It's like a cache, a weapons cache that they have in there.  Like what that they bring up.  She has said shit to me that I cannot.  Uh, she held out on telling me about this dude that she had sex with until like, I,  I could not believe the timing of this.  Wow.  Wait, wait, wait, wait, do she had sex with her for you?  Well, it was sort of in this weird gray area where we, you know, we weren't like, it  was one of those gray areas.  You weren't committed, right.  Right. 
[03:23:30]  But it was a dude I knew and it was a dude that, you know, we're not friends or nothing,  but we were up in Seattle.  Everything was going good.  Me and the girl, we just had great sex.  We're getting along.  And then out of nowhere she goes, oh, by the way, you know, I, I, I swept with this  guy and I'm like, and I was like, what the fuck?  Like, it's not even that I care that much only in that I'm like, now I got to be, you  know, you fuck that guy and he fucked me.  And I got to know that.  And like, you know, now like he's got to know that.  And that's like, what are you doing to yourself?  What do you, this exaggerate, a little bit exaggerated, it's got to have, she's got 
[03:24:00]  to have some good points, but this just seems like, you know, friend to friend.  She's adorable.  And, uh, and she's really smart and she's like quirky and she's sweet.  Why did she tell you she fucked him?  Did she feel guilty all of a sudden or she's trying to sabotage a good thing?  I, I, I think she told me it was preemptive.  I think she, she thought, started to think that I would, uh, find out.  Yeah.  Okay.  And, and why she picked right after sex while we were out of town on the first day we  were out of town.  So I, I couldn't have a way out.  I couldn't send her home.  I couldn't, you know, and then, but see, that's one of those things where why the hell can 
[03:24:30]  I just get over it?  What do I care?  You know, I'm, I've been the dirtiest pig in the world.  I mean, what do I, like, what do I care?  She's not winning.  I got mad at a girl.  I got mad at a girl one time because I knew she was doing something one day with a guy.  She was fooling around the guy lightly.  Like she didn't fuck him.  Yeah.  She didn't get her pussy.  I knew she was like a light thing.  We had just been seeing each other and I knew on the day that she was, cause I remember  where I was, I was in Las Vegas having a threesome, but she didn't know that.  So I fucking, you were the moral, you had the high ground. 
[03:25:00]  Dude, I was, I was fucking all over her for that.  And I finally had to tell her like, hey, look, I was getting blown while a guy was fucking  his wife.  Really?  Yeah.  It was, it was actually not that good of a threesome.  That doesn't sound like it.  The wife was blowing you while he was fucking her?  Fucking her, yeah.  And that was it.  I mean, that was, I didn't fuck her.  I didn't want to fuck her.  But do you say goodbye to the couple after something like that?  Like, you know, say you two have a good time.  Fucking pay him.  They leave.  Oh, you pay him?  Oh, I didn't realize it. 
[03:25:30]  It's a live sex show.  You can watch it.  It's interactive if you want.  Oh, it wasn't just someone you met at a show?  No.  Like a couple.  Yeah, so that picture of Stan, you're like, all right, like tweeting as she's blowing  him.  Yeah.  You're into this, you know?  No, Twitter wasn't around then, but, uh.  Oh, literal, Jim.  I wish I was exaggerating.  You're right.  I'm sorry, Bill.  Twitter's been around.  I'm tired.  You're an old asshole I am.  No, I'm just technically Bill Clinton was an old asshole I am.  Bill, I do.  I thank you, though.  I do wish I was.  Does that brain ever shut off?  And you got mad?  You got mad at her? 
[03:26:00]  Oh, yeah, yeah.  But it's that self-righteous stuff.  Wow.  What are you thinking right now?  I'm thinking that I said too much.  But I, um.  But no, Bill, like, I appreciate the concern, you know, because I.  Yeah, just looking out for you.  Yeah, it's driven me a little crazy that after all these three and a half years of all this heartache and bullshit I went through, I finally come out of the tunnel a bit, and I get emotionally connected to something that is so volatile.  You got to just make sure that you don't keep casting your rod into the same poison pond, and you keep pulling out the same one. 
[03:26:30]  You know what I mean?  I watched a buddy of mine do that.  He kept breaking up.  Chicks are fucking psychos.  And he would consistently show up with the exact same kind of girl.  It's like, dude, why don't you stop fucking pulling these fucking girls out of that fucked up goddamn dive of a bar?  Yeah, right, yeah.  Stop.  There's nothing but damaged people in there, including yourself.  Stop sticking your dick into hurricanes.  Exactly.  Join a softball league.  Take a cooking class.  Find something. 
[03:27:00]  But the problem is you're wired for those girls.  I'm a wired, I'm like an emotional suicide bomber.  I am wired to self-detonate as soon as I really feel close to somebody.  Because they fuck really good.  Of course they do.  Those kooks fuck really good.  But we're kooks.  The worse the father, the better the fuck.  That's right.  That's one of the truest statements ever made.  Oh, God.  That's why we like that.  That's why you answer your question.  But we're kooks, too.  We can't separate ourselves from it.  I mean, who the fuck lives like us?  You know, I'm 46 years old, and I was with her the other night at 1.30 in the morning eating at a diner. 
[03:27:30]  Or, you know, I'm like, every other guy my age has got kids.  He's sleeping right now.  Not that I want to.  And he'd love to be you.  Fucking a hot chick who's a great fuck instead of his fucking fat minivan wife with her dumb fucking kids.  He'd love to be you.  Can we switch for a week?  Because I've got a weird fantasy.  Dude, he'd love to be you.  There's an old expression.  One, uh, 50 bad men can't ruin one good woman.  But one good woman can ruin 50 bad men. 
[03:28:00]  I mean, one bad woman can ruin 50 good men.  A fucking woman who can fuck can run any of us through the fucking mill.  But a guy who's a good fuck will get dumped even if he...  There's no better girl than one that has to take a little plastic bag out in the morning and pull different colored pills out.  That's right.  Yes.  Oh, please.  There's always a purple one.  Come on.  Are we kidding?  Yeah.  No, that's...  Yeah, that's it.  As she surfaces from the pile of clothing on her bed,  her little head comes out looking for her pill bag. 
[03:28:30]  Mark's in trouble, man.  You're in trouble.  I am in trouble a little bit.  Does that brain ever shut down so you can go to sleep at night?  No, you just lay there.  How do you fucking fall asleep?  Well, by the end of the day, I'm tired.  From all this.  All the yelling.  You're just exhausted.  You just get exhausted.  I just get exhausted.  It's spinning.  Right after Patrice told me that, because it was Patrice,  I don't think I talked about this the last time I was here,  because I've become aware of my head.  I got onto a train the last time I was in New York,  and I'm thinking, like, you know,  stay out of your head, stay out of your head.  And I sit on this train. 
[03:29:00]  A woman gets on the train.  She's got a box with an ice cream maker in it,  because I see the ice cream maker on the box.  And I just, my brain just immediately was like,  I like fucking ice cream.  Maybe I could have an ice cream maker.  How do you make ice cream?  What kind of ice cream do I make?  Could I make the better ice cream than I would buy at the store?  You know, like, I love ice cream so much,  it'd be like living with a drug dealer.  That's exhausting.  Right.  But I had to, like, literally say, shut the fuck up.  And then I had to stop myself from yelling at the woman,  I guess you can handle it.  But that thought process is what makes you a great comic.  It's like, maybe there's a price to pay for it,  but the average person gets on and just looks and goes, 
[03:29:30]  box.  Your podcast has a hell of a buzz there, Mark Maron.  Get a little business out of the way.  Oh, yeah.  Your podcast is doing real well.  WTFpod.com.  Yeah, thanks, man.  What are you taping in New York tonight?  Comics?  Yeah, we're doing two shows of comics.  The first show is David Cross, Michael Showalter, Glenn Wool,  Maeve Higgins, and, oh, shit.  Who else?  The one other one.  The second show is Bobby Kelly, Dave Attell. 
[03:30:00]  That's a 930 show.  Dave Attell, Bobby Kelly, Kurt Metzger, Joe DeRosa, and Anthony Jeselnik.  You literally could have broken that down in the first show,  call it people who hate Jim Norton, and the second show,  people who like Jim.  Oh, wow.  Really?  On the poster, I said nerdier and dirtier.  That's right.  I don't know why they would hate you.  That's why, like, I love you, and we had you on the show.  It was very enjoyable.  Well, it's just, it's amazing, because there are people with the podcast, 
[03:30:30]  they've never listened to you, and they never listened to Patrice.  Patrice's podcast blew some fucking minds.  I got some emails, like, from people that were like,  I don't know what that was, or why that,  because, like, when you talk to Patrice for a while there, you know,  it's amazing, because somewhere in the middle of it,  you're like, I'm talking to Satan.  Like, there's, because he's selling you on these ideas,  you're like, I shouldn't be agreeing with this.  But it's like, yeah, yeah.  He's making sense.  This shit is so logical.  Oh, yeah.  It was great.  Until you break it down later and go, what am I? 
[03:31:00]  Patrice is the fucking pyramid scheme of relationships.  He actually convinces you that it's okay to fuck another girl  and then make your chick smell it and say, that's what you get, bitch.  Exactly.  He's a great salesman.  Yeah, he's amazing.  But, like, a lot of the people that you would think would listen to,  like, I just do comics of all kinds.  I don't blame fantasy and judgment.  So a lot of people are fans of you now that didn't know you before.  Yeah, it was, God, we had a nice write-up, too,  by this guy who writes Van Lee Fair.  I never get good write-ups by those guys.  Van Lee Fair.  Oh, I remember reading that.  Like, he's a good example of a guy that may not have known you 
[03:31:30]  or taken you into consideration.  Yeah, this guy, James Walcott.  Jim Walcott, he's great.  He's a fan of yours, too.  I've spoken to him.  He's actually, he loves you, man.  And you go after guys that, not after, that's a wrong word,  but you talk to guys that you have problems with, too.  Which is mostly everybody.  Like, there's always a little tension.  Me and Bill had a little bit of tension, but not hostile tension,  just sort of like...  Wait, you guys had a problem before the podcast?  How could they not?  I wasn't aware.  I was classic Mark Maron.  Wait, you didn't like Bill Burr?  No, no, no.  What was this about?  Well, no, it's not a problem. 
[03:32:00]  We just didn't really know each other as well as we did after the podcast.  Like, you make assumptions about people,  and there were assumptions made about each other,  and I think that we found a common ground.  I think he had made some assumptions about me.  Oh, come on!  You're talking about...  No, no, no.  No, what are we talking about?  Oh, wait, I remember.  No, and I remember you are right,  because I remember the first time I saw Mark,  I was doing an open mic at Stitches Comedy Club in Boston,  and you came walking in,  and it was right when the 80s boom had died out.  It was the early 90s, right? 
[03:32:30]  And then there was this whole new wave of guys coming in,  and he came in,  and there was some open mic-er who had gone up before him  and done a bit about Cheez Whiz,  and he went on stage and immediately is destroying,  and I'm like,  wow, this guy's a fucking unbelievable comedian,  and then started trashing the open mic-er  before he did something to the effect.  Yeah, and what is the deal with Cheez Whiz?  Oh, no.  I don't know,  but I just sit around going,  fuck!  And all of us open mic-ers were like,  did he just compliment his act,  or did he shit on it? 
[03:33:00]  And then the comedian you were with  bursted out laughing,  and then I got totally insecure,  because I still hadn't gone on,  and thought that you were going to trash me,  and I was like,  this guy's a dick.  I don't like this guy.  You were both right.  That's right.  Yeah.  That's right.  Yeah, so we talk about that,  but there's a lot of people I would never know.  Like, I just did two episodes with Judd Apatow,  because he...  He loves comedians.  Well, he wrote me...  Loves.  I wouldn't know.  He emailed me...  Oh, Jimmy. 
[03:33:30]  Oh, what happened, Jimmy?  Jesus, you know?  You know what's weird about him,  is when he was 16 years old,  he interviewed comics.  Yeah, he talked about this on our show.  He loves it.  Yeah, I had the tapes.  He had the tapes.  We digitized them.  We used them on the first episode  of the Judd Apatow episode on WTF.  Yeah, I gotta check that one out.  We used the interviews with Shanling Seinfeld  and Jay Leno in 1983...  That he did when he was 16 years old.  Wow, that's cool.  And he just loves comics,  and he's a fan of the show,  so he got in touch with me,  and I wouldn't have seen myself talking to him. 
[03:34:00]  We had a good time with him.  Yeah, he's a funny guy.  What's going on with you and Rogan?  Because I follow you on Twitter,  and you're chasing Rogan,  and he hasn't accepted yet.  The first time I asked him to come on,  he didn't want to,  because I'd done the two episodes with Mencia,  and he didn't want to...  Because I didn't realize...  Because I wanted him to come on the show,  and I didn't care if he talked about Mencia,  but I didn't realize that that video,  really, of him calling out Mencia,  is really their wedding video.  In the sense that, you know,  he's going to be...  Married to him, right? 
[03:34:30]  Right.  Right.  So I understood it.  I said,  we don't have to talk about that.  Maybe another time we'll wait it out.  And then I emailed him again  to come on the podcast,  and he just didn't even email me back.  So someone on Twitter said,  you know,  why don't you have Rogan and I?  I just wanted to make it clear  that I have an open invitation to Rogan.  Right.  That's all.  There's no problem with him and I.  Did you change your opinions  on some of these guys  after you talked to them?  Yeah, I changed...  Did you change your opinion on Mencia?  No, I didn't.  My opinion was just that,  you know,  initially I didn't know  how deep the weirdness  and the crime of stealing was. 
[03:35:00]  So what happened with those episodes  is I did a whole episode,  and I felt like he was bullshitting me.  And I didn't know  what the fuck to do with the episode  because I already told people  I'd done it,  and I was in trouble  because I got this big,  you know,  bunch of bullshit.  So then I started talking  to some other comics,  and Magical said,  you know,  talked to some of the Latino guys,  so I talked to these  two Latino comics,  Willie Barsena and,  and what's the other guy's name?  The Trevino,  Steve Trevino,  who opened for Mencia  about some of the allegations  and stuff.  And then I called Mencia back, 
[03:35:30]  and I said,  look, you know,  we've got to,  I've got to do some follow-up  because, you know,  I'm not happy with,  you know,  how you handled the,  you know,  the stealing issue  and all this other stuff.  And he literally said,  I said,  we could do it on the phone  because I was trying  to be done a confrontation.  Yeah, right.  And then he goes,  I'll be right over.  Oh, good for you  for calling him at least.  Like an hour,  and it was like this weird,  like he,  he couldn't quite keep  his story together  and he couldn't,  like, you know,  he was unraveling a little bit  and it was,  Oh, shit.  It was pretty wild.  And, uh,  and so my opinion of him,  if anything,  I was like, 
[03:36:00]  you know,  this is a,  the guy's a troubled guy,  you know,  more than anything else.  I'm not saying he's  any better a person  or a comedian.  It's like the,  when you're the wizard  and the fucking curtain  is coming down  and you just,  you're holding it up  with one hand  in front of your face.  There's a certain humiliation  with it.  I'm not saying,  right,  that's right.  And it's like,  as a guy,  I like to do,  like I took a flight  with him recently  which happened to be  on the same plane together  going to Dallas or whatever  and it was like,  he's a pleasant guy.  It's like,  you want to like Carlos  and it's like,  he's a nice guy to talk to.  So he's a nice dude.  There's something wrong  with the wiring  and I had Dane on, 
[03:36:30]  you know,  and I have people on  that I wouldn't like,  with Dane,  I didn't,  I was never one,  a real hater of Dane  or never,  and I never registered him  one way or the other.  I just never found him,  you know,  that interesting  as a comedian  and I judged him  as more of an indication  of something horrible  with society  as opposed to being  a bad comic.  But I,  but like he wanted  to come on,  you know,  and I,  and the thing that happens  when I interview these guys  is all the haters  now have an opportunity  to see them as people,  to hear them as,  it's not like,  you know, 
[03:37:00]  that fuckerman,  see you,  or fucking Dane Cook.  Now it's a guy  talking for an hour  like a human being  and you can judge him.  If you want to hate,  then fine,  now you know him  as a person.  And I literally  was with Dane,  I was like,  I was like,  why do people hate you so much?  I didn't know really  what to talk to him about.  But he probably  wants to answer that.  He did.  He's very prepared.  He's very focused.  It's like that scene  in Frost Nixon.  There's a great scene  where the guy is like,  Nixon's a criminal,  I never want to shake his hand.  And then Nixon walks in  and he goes,  hi,  I'm Richard Nixon.  And the guy's like,  hi.  Nixon puts his hand out. 
[03:37:30]  It's like whenever a hater  normally is,  again,  especially when it's something  like a comic,  it's,  people normally are very,  like surprised pleasantly.  They're singular.  They're not multi-dimension  to people when they're,  they're hating out  because they're part  of a group that hates people  because that guy  represents something.  When it's a person,  it's very hard  unless you're an asshole.  Right.  It was so funny though  because I,  you know,  you hooked me up with Dane.  That was nice of you.  And I,  the weird thing was  is when he wanted  to do the show,  he called me out of nowhere  in San Francisco.  I'm walking down the street  and I go,  hello.  And he goes, 
[03:38:00]  Mark,  it's Dane Cook.  And I'm like,  holy shit,  you have this energy  on the phone too?  Like are you at home  pacing around?  What's going on?  When are we going  to do the show?  Very intense fellow,  that guy.  Isn't he?  Coming from you.  No,  he's very,  yeah,  he's very focused.  I tried to get under  his skin a little bit  but it didn't really work.  No.  And people ended up  liking him more.  He's so used to it.  Huh?  He's so used to it  at this point.  Dude,  his brother stole a million,  it's like after something  awful like that happened,  it's like,  what's going to phase you  after your fucking stepbrother  or whatever the fuck 
[03:38:30]  that was?  But he's got like  the,  the Teflon,  he's got the disposition  of a politician.  You know,  like he's like,  he's very clear about,  you know,  how far he's going to go  with the conversation.  You know,  he's very deliberate.  You know,  when I,  when I brought up one thing  out of that,  that kind of threw him  a little bit,  the weird thing was  he was not that funny  about it.  Oh shit.  Like his first response  was not to make a joke.  It was like,  that was between me  and that person.  Straight interview.  Oh yeah.  Yeah.  It was a little intense.  No fun.  Yeah.  I'm guessing Louis CK then. 
[03:39:00]  No,  this was about Steve Burnham.  actually.  But now,  okay,  but this week,  it took me a long time.  I'm going to interview  Louis this week.  I'm interviewing Ira Glass today.  That's going to be interesting.  You're running out of guys.  No,  it was an interesting opportunity.  I mean,  I,  you know,  that guy is,  it's a great thing.  He's a radio guy.  I mean,  he's changed the face  of public radio.  So I,  he's going to be  an interesting interview.  Oh,  and Jonathan Ames.  I'm going to,  did you,  have you guys talked to him?  Yeah,  I did an episode of his show.  He's great.  Yeah,  he's a good.  Well, 
[03:39:30]  he used to do standup kind of.  Of course.  He's dating Fiona Apple.  Still?  Yeah.  He's a dirty boy.  Have you read his books?  No,  I hear he's very good though.  He's right up your alley.  I mean,  he's like,  yeah,  yeah.  He looks like a complete filth bag though.  Cause he's really,  he's really,  he's a very funny dude  and he's a very funny writer  and he's quiet  and a very pleasant man.  You can just tell  there's something fucking despicable  happening there.  He just has that vibe.  He writes about it though.  He's written books on books,  books and books about his experience  with transvestites  and,  you know,  insanity.  Oh wow. 
[03:40:00]  So he's really,  oh yeah,  he's a real deal.  It looks like I'll be reading  books and books.  We can fucking high five  over someone who is  very disappointed  to their entire family.  Wow.  I,  I got to bring up  the fact that I saw  Bill Burr.  Oh right.  Yeah.  Last night in,  what was that?  Date.  Date night.  Date night.  Date night.  I like how you had  the decent seat to go.  What was that?  Like I've booked  a ton of films.  What was that?  That was the,  the only major motion picture  I've ever been in.  Yes.  It was great.  I'm watching.  And I'm like, 
[03:40:30]  holy shit,  Bill Burr.  I just sit there like,  it's the oddest thing  when you're just sitting there.  Well,  I'm just fucking watching.  Then it stops being a movie.  It's Bill Burr.  It does.  It does.  I know that guy.  But at the end,  you know,  well,  you know,  big scene,  kind of rushing out  on the roof.  Where was that?  Fucking Silver Cup?  No,  it was.  It was a roof of Silver Cup.  I see the bridge  in the background.  Yeah,  I think that's exactly  what it is.  Yeah,  that's right.  You should come on  the 59th Street Bridge.  Let me be Bob Kelly.  Dude,  that movie sucked.  I mean,  you were good, 
[03:41:00]  but that movie sucked.  Bob's an animal.  He's an animal.  But my favorite,  Bill comes through  one of the rooftop doors  and he's a cop.  And he's got  a classic rooftop scene  for Bill Burr.  He's got the gun out  and I love it.  He's just,  drop the guns,  drop the guns.  And he's kind of  running toward him like,  Bill fucking looks  good with a gun.  You look fucking good.  You look the part.  You were pulling it off.  Here's the behind the scenes.  Behind the scenes.  Yeah.  Behind the scenes.  I'm holding, 
[03:41:30]  it's a Glock 9  and I had my thumb  right behind evidently  where that piece  would have just  slide.  Oh, so your finger  would have been,  your thumb would have  been cracked backwards.  And the gut,  right before the scene,  like I just,  I just decided to hold it.  I wasn't even thinking.  I was just more,  just don't fuck up your lines.  Right?  So I put my thumb behind it  and the gun guy  was really just off camera  goes,  are you fucking serious?  Like,  and it's really this tone.  It's like,  dude,  what the fuck?  Yeah,  I'm pretending to be a cop.  I don't know where  to put my finger,  you dick.  You want to do these lines?  That's why you're over there. 
[03:42:00]  And what that really was  is I felt really fucking stupid.  Did they make you fix it?  Go back to the anger book.  No, I remember what it was.  No, this is what it was.  We were all sitting there  in that,  the stairwell  and it's like me  and like five other guys  dressed total fucking  trunch and shit  and then I did that  and then the guy  over my head goes,  are you fucking serious?  And I felt,  I felt embarrassed  because I was the only guy  with lines  and I felt like,  you know,  what does this guy know?  The fucking director  or something?  How do they get this shit  in there?  So did they fix it  or can I freeze frame 
[03:42:30]  and see you hold the guns?  No, no, no.  I actually turned around  and said,  hey, thanks.  But then afterwards  I was just like,  you didn't have to  fucking say it like that.  Use it for the scene.  Use it for the scene.  Who else is in the scene?  Everybody.  Everybody from the movie  was in that scene.  I haven't seen the movie  so who else is in the movie?  Ray Liotta,  Steve Carell,  Tina Fey.  I think that was on the plane.  I should have watched it.  Common,  it's weird,  I only have eight lines  in the movie  but I'm in a ton of scenes.  You're like in there  the whole movie.  Just sort of standing  next to famous people talking.  It's great, 
[03:43:00]  you're in there though.  Rubbing my chin  intently listening.  Just enough to completely  take me out of the movie.  Yeah, I know.  I was like,  yeah, I know.  It's fucking Bill.  Oh, no,  that's what I always do.  Then I'll just be,  if I see,  if I saw Jimmy in the movie,  yeah,  does Jimmy look,  look at Jimmy,  Jimmy looks comfortable.  By the time you thought that,  my scene would be over.  They've learned how to cut around me.  I haven't done a film  in almost 20 years.  That's not true.  You were almost famous.  Right,  how long ago was that?  You were fucking great.  Almost 20 years.  How long ago was that?  No, it wasn't.  That was like 10 years ago.  No.  I bet you more than 10  at this point.  Yeah, it's probably 96. 
[03:43:30]  Yeah.  Yeah, that was 1996.  Something like that.  No, it wasn't.  I'll Google it.  I was with my first wife.  No, it wasn't,  because Jimmy Fallon  got a big part in that,  and that was after he was on SNL.  I remember that.  Just barely.  Like,  98, 99.  I'm going to go with,  I don't know.  Uh-oh, IMDb.  Almost Famous was 2000.  2000.  Yeah.  Bam.  Oh, my God.  What has happened?  10 years.  In those 10 years.  10 years.  That makes it feel like 20.  He was so nice,  that guy,  Cameron Crowe.  Like,  he treated me like,  literally, 
[03:44:00]  I had to do that scene,  and he would walk around going,  we had to import this anger  from New York.  You know,  and I'm running around screaming,  and then the saddest thing was,  there's a scene where I chased  the bus up the ramp  on a little cart,  you know,  and that's the end of the scene,  but they shot that after  the second crew came in,  everyone else left.  Billy Crudup.  All the,  everybody on the movie left,  except me,  and a camera crew  at midnight,  driving a golf cart  after a bus up a ramp  over and over and over again,  and I'm like,  this is movies.  This is it.  I've arrived. 
[03:44:30]  I can't breathe  from the fucking exhaust.  But I'd love to do another movie.  No,  they're fun as hell.  As long as you have enough,  I just said,  waiting in the trailer  is the only thing that sucks,  but once you get out there,  it's a shit.  See,  I always find it's just the opposite.  Waiting in the trailer  is the best part  until I get out  and I prove  what an awful decision they made.  Fucking bug-eyed cunt.  Grr!  Cut.  Weren't you  in one of the Batman movies?  Didn't you have a line  in one of the Spider-Man?  Yeah,  yeah,  yeah,  yeah.  Surly truck driver.  But he was great.  Yeah, 
[03:45:00]  yeah.  Thank you.  One line.  Thanks,  and I don't like him.  Yeah.  That was it.  Yeah,  but you had a great moment  before you.  You were really in the scene.  I thought he was great.  Thank you.  I like that one.  Fucking Leota calls you Skippy.  And then walking out,  you're like,  Skippy,  I have a fucking gun.  Oh,  they kept that?  Yeah.  They had to watch a movie.  You barely hear it.  Like,  you just mumble it  as you walk out  and it's like,  that's a funny fucking line.  No,  we got into it.  I said,  maybe I'll buy a shiny suit  like yours  or something like that.  They actually let us go.  I said,  oh,  great,  all my improv's  going to be in there  and it doesn't.  It doesn't.  And I'm like, 
[03:45:30]  oh,  wait a minute.  I'm on the,  I'm on like the  see others part  of the IMD.  It's like cast  others.  No,  but I've never been  in a movie  where I actually  had a name.  So now I actually,  I actually had a last name,  Detective Walsh.  So I've gotten  to the point  where I have a last name.  Did you work with it?  Were you like,  Walsh,  I'm Walsh.  Yes.  Come from an Irish family.  Then again,  so was,  so was  the whole history.  Yeah,  yeah,  yeah.  No,  I had a,  I had a,  I had a great time with it 
[03:46:00]  and yeah,  it was,  it was awesome.  That's gotta be cool though.  Fucking,  you know,  Ray Ligota.  I'm hoping they do another one  and they,  they make my part bigger  like Jack Kehoe  in another 48 hours.  Jack Kehoe!  And then I end up  trying to kill Steve Carell  and then,  then somebody figures it out.  How could you do it,  Bill?  I needed the money!  I forgot about that.  Edge of the building?  Don't do it!  Two sucked!  Yeah,  I just didn't,  I auditioned for that,  for Curb.  I never auditioned  for Curb Your Enthusiast  and last week  they had, 
[03:46:30]  they had these auditions  and that's weird  because they don't,  you don't get a script.  They just give you  this little piece of paper.  There's all these  pieces of papers.  One of them was  for a black guy  and then tells the scene  the black guy's in.  I auditioned for Computer Guy  which was the,  then they just list the scene.  I saw Jerry Miner there,  you know,  who's a black guy, right?  He was in Lucky Louie.  He's a funny guy, right?  So like I walk in  and he walks in  and he goes,  are you going up  for black guy?  Of course I am.  They're not sure  what they want to do  with the part.  But then you just go in,  the audition is you literally  just go into a room 
[03:47:00]  and improvise with Larry.  They give you the scene  and you walk in  and he's like,  hey,  Mark Maron!  You know,  and I'm like,  hey,  how you doing?  What are we doing here?  And he goes,  well,  let's do it!  Let's do it!  Why?  Right,  so then I just,  he had lost my,  the scene was I walk in,  I was at a restaurant  and I went to the bathroom  and he was sitting there  and I was using my computer  and I said,  could you watch my computer  when I go to the bathroom  and I came out,  he was gone,  the computer was gone  and everything else  and I run into him  a few days later  and he tells me  that he let a black guy  watch my computer  and I'm supposed to get angry 
[03:47:30]  and then,  you know,  check myself for my racism.  Right.  It's a lot of information.  So literally,  I do the scene,  I'm like,  what kind of person  walks away  from a guy  who hasn't watched his computer  and I go,  I just ran  and then I feel bad  and I do the whole scene  and I walk out  and I immediately think like,  oh shit,  that's just what they need,  another aggravated Jew  on that show.  How am I going to get that part?  There's enough aggravated Jews,  I should have played it differently.  I'm never going to go out  on these things again.  Oh my God.  I guess you've got to go on 
[03:48:00]  at the audition though.  I guess you've got to go  on the auditions  to get movies.  Yeah,  yeah,  I do.  You know?  Yeah,  unless somebody just wants  to put you in one.  Yeah,  just put you in one.  Oh fuck.  That's what I'm hoping.  Let's come out  with enough specials  where they just start  offering you the,  the George Carlin role  in that Dogma movie  or something.  Come on down,  you can play the truck driver.  Big fan of your comedy,  come on down,  you've got five scenes.  You'll be out of here  in two weeks.  Is this your second hour?  Is this hour?  Yes.  It's good, man. 
[03:48:30]  Sunday night,  11 p.m.,  Comedy Central.  Yes.  Let it go.  I'm not going to be jealous.  I'm on two minutes  overtime right now.  Well,  be jealous,  then I can do another WTF  and we can work it out.  You can come on  anytime you want.  We taped your show.  You don't have to be polite  just because,  you know what I mean?  I'm trying to,  that means he's running  out of comedians.  He's got to get all you guys  back a second.  You're still that dick  that fucked up the open mic.  I am.  He did my Monday morning podcast  and people raving that,  you know,  the Kinnison stories. 
[03:49:00]  Yeah,  I told them to hear one too.  Yeah,  he had all these stories.  You told those last time.  I don't know.  A few times ago.  Bill Burr has a great podcast,  yeah.  I keep it underground.  Bill Burr's podcast is good too.  You should check that out.  How about Otto?  You should interview Otto.  I'd like to interview Otto.  Actually,  the weird thing is  I'm not running out.  I've done 107  and I can't,  and I can't,  it's amazing how many comics  are like,  oh shit,  you're,  of course.  They just keep coming.  He's an interesting guy,  man.  He's had a tremendous  fucking interest.  I want to do Colin too.  I called him,  but he's busy with the show.  This is the last week,  right?  I think so, 
[03:49:30]  yeah.  And I did Sag it.  We're going to put that up  I think in a week or two.  Was he serious at all?  Yeah.  Bob went serious on you?  Pretty serious,  but he's like,  he can't be serious.  Very hard.  Towards the end,  it got a little serious.  You know,  sometimes when comedians  get serious,  like,  I'm a pretty serious guy,  and there's that moment  where you're like,  oh,  we're in serious zone,  and like,  I'm just going to let it happen  and not freak out.  You're all conscious of it.  We're in serious mode.  Something's happening.  Right.  And someone has to make the joke  to get you out of it.  Yeah.  All right. 
[03:50:00]  And Mark Maron,  of course,  you can see these podcasts  at WTFPod.com.  Right?  Yeah, yeah.  But comics is the big news.  Tonight there's two shows.  A lot of great comedians.  I got stickers.  Are you taped live on the stage?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  And those will be on your website?  Right, yeah.  We just,  the live one just went up on Monday.  That was fucking hilarious.  So you guys are sitting down  on the comic stage.  Right.  For the live ones,  they're different than the one-on-ones.  Like,  I put one up on Monday  from Bumper Shoot in Seattle.  It was Patton Oswalt, 
[03:50:30]  that guy Donald Glover,  Eddie Pepitone,  Nick Kroll,  Doug Benson.  That was funny.  It was Nick Kroll  that was doing this Latino DJ character.  It was hilarious.  El Chupacabra.  Eleven o'clock  and a half hour  of my Boneyard show starts.  Oh.  Mars Maron,  a pleasure, brother.  You'd like to listen.  Nice to see you guys.  If you're listening,  a pleasure.  Hey, anybody see Machete?  Read the rest of that book.  Is it good?  Machete?  It's a great set of a B movie.  A Grindhouse movie?  They were very loyal to that fake trailer.  Is it like one of them Rob Zombie movies? 
[03:51:00]  Is it like,  who directed?  It's better than that.  Oh, yeah?  Robert Rodriguez.  Rodriguez.  Oh, that's great.  I like Rob Zombie movies, too,  by the way.  I do, too, kind of.  That Halloween one  where he tried to figure out  how Mike got to the way he was,  that was really interesting.  I didn't see that  when I saw the two weird ones  with the family that kills.  The House of a Thousand Corpses.  Yeah, I kind of like those.  Turn off the lights  when you guys are done.  Yeah, we're getting out of here, right?  Thank you.  All right, everybody.  Have a pleasant day.  Bill, are you going back to L.A. today?  No, I'm here until Saturday. 
[03:51:30]  I'm here until Saturday.  Who's in tomorrow?  I don't know.  You come back if you want.  It's up to you.  No pressure.  If I don't have, like, morning TV,  because...  That's a nice problem to have.  But those eight minutes  as the weatherman  is getting ready for the forecast  is your...  The forced laugh of the host  so you know what the cuck is broke.  Oh, and they don't even listen to you?  Mark, you come back, too, if you want.  So, Jimmy, I hear you have a fish.  I hate that when they just go off the bio.  And then it...  What's up with the lawn?  You're in Spider-Man, weren't you? 
[03:52:00]  I had one line.  What are you doing?  Yeah.  Hey, do I have...  A thing?  Something?  Jimmy, so you're controversial.  Say...  What controversial things  will you be discussing tonight?  A thing after the show.  I don't want to sit and...  No, you won't sit.  And, uh, wait.  Oh, Danny boy.  Although, Windows is great  when you go to shut it down  and it goes,  power...  Please do not power off  or unplug your machine  installing updates.  That's not great.  It's like,  no, it's not.  Because I can't shut it off now.  I've got to sit here 
[03:52:30]  and wait for my goddamn computer.  Mike doesn't do that.  And it's day and age.  Mike doesn't do that.  What the fuck is it?  See you tomorrow, folks.  Yeah, that's good.  All right.  See you tomorrow. </pre>
