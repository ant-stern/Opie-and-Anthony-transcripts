<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony show began with a discussion about a Ron and Fez intern, nicknamed "Puddin," who took photos of the staff's feet for a website contest.  This led to a conversation about Ron and Fez's upcoming move to Tampa and their interns' generally bizarre behavior.  The hosts then previewed upcoming Opie and Anthony segments: a best body competition, a teen car wash, "Sex for Sam 2," and a man-boob contest.  Ron and Fez joined the show, further detailing Puddin's antics and expressing disgust over "Mollyrama.com," a website featuring young girls in provocative poses. This sparked a lengthy, graphic discussion about the site's content, legality, and ethics. Several callers weighed in, including a 15-year-old girl suggesting a "big boob" contest.  Suspicions about staff members leaking show information to the media were also aired.  The discussion also included movie reviews, focusing on the negative reception of Jurassic Park 3.

Opie then recounted a horrifying stay in a dilapidated "crack hotel" in Manhattan, describing its unsanitary conditions and his resulting sleepless night, including concerns about STDs and the need for clean underwear.  A local restaurant advertisement aired.  The show continued with a WWF Invasion pay-per-view promotion, highlighting a bra and panties tag team match.  Callers shared their own "crack hotel" experiences and concerns about crabs.  The conversation then veered towards Chandra Levy's browsing history, prompting the hosts to check their own computers.  This revealed a variety of websites, ranging from news to adult content, and led to accusations about who accessed what.

A "wow" campaign segment with listener Ray Ray followed, as did a discussion on the femininity of carrying a handbag with a change of clothes.  Black Earl's surprisingly clean browsing history was revealed, contrasted with Opie's computer, which showed numerous boy band websites.  This led to a comical interrogation of intern John, who eventually confessed to his boy band obsession.  Callers with jobs monitoring computer usage discussed the ethical and legal implications of such monitoring.  The show continued with Ben's upcoming birthday party (whose location was unexpectedly shut down by U.S. Marshals), a live read for Pinnacle Horny Goat Weed, and a caller's confession to masturbating while listening.  Jay Moore's recent Penthouse interview, specifically a story about a teenage DUI, was also discussed.

A caller recounted a terrifying police encounter involving a suspended license. This transitioned into discussions about drunk people's open mouths and a segment with Jay Moore discussing his role in "Black River."  Adrian suggested a one-breasted wet t-shirt contest for mastectomy patients, followed by a discussion of unusual boxing matches the hosts had staged, including details of injuries sustained during a blind boxing match. Jay Moore further discussed his career, including upcoming projects with Eddie Murphy and Al Pacino.  Brief calls with April and Amy followed.  A heated discussion ensued with Angel, an angry Puerto Rican man recently released from jail after protesting the Vieques bombing.  This involved contentious exchanges about government assistance, American imperialism, and the Puerto Rican independence struggle, with Jamaica Mike also participating.  This segment included frequent use of racial slurs and offensive language. The show concluded with a Stadium Auto Mall commercial, discussions about a firefighters vs. police officers boxing match and Anthony recounting a confrontation with a Puerto Rican man over an American flag.

Finally, a Philly caller heavily criticized the show.  This transitioned into a Pinnacle Horny Goat Weed advertisement and testimonial from "Old Dirty."  Jim Brewer was a guest in studio, his large paycheck being the subject of jokes.  Uncle John and Angel also participated, with Angel again sparking controversy over the Vieques bombing.  The show ended with jokes about Old Dirty's scams, Opie's boy band material, a caller's "crack hotel" story, and more raunchy humor and mocking of social and political issues.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  Hour, hour, hour, hour, by Opie and Anthony, all owned by Infinity Broadcasting, this is  1027 WNEW, New York, Opie and Anthony show, New York, Dallas, Chicago, Philly, Cleveland,  Columbus, Sacramento, San Francisco, the empire is spreading, conquerors you bastards! 
[00:00:30]  And welcome to the Opie and Anthony show, a couple phone numbers to give out in New York,  877-692-1027, and for everyone else out there in radio land, 866-277-4-WOW, 866-277-4-WOW, give us a call, alright?  What's up, Anthony?  I'm not getting anything on my computer, that's what I'm thinking.  Your computer's effed up. 
[00:01:00]  Oh, goddammit.  Restart, restart.  You know, I think we gotta get Ron and Fez in here.  Why's that?  I don't know.  Ron and Fez, they do the radio show before us in New York City.  Yeah.  And we're doing a show meeting in the back office, and they have one of their, can I call  him a flunky?  Loser.  A loser.  Who was that guy, Ben?  I don't even know who this guy was.  Who was that?  He was just one of their interns, and I just told their whole staff the story, and, you 
[00:01:30]  know, they're just, like, what a loser.  I don't remember hiring that kid.  I know.  How did I get past him?  I was going through the proper channels.  Maybe Rick had a private meeting with him.  How did it get past you, Opie?  I don't know.  Aren't you, like, assistant muckety-muck?  You're assistant to the assistant manager.  So, one of Ron and Fez guys comes into our office.  We have about eight of us.  We're doing a show meeting, getting things together.  We got a lot of announcements to make. 
[00:02:00]  We're working on something called Wow Stock.  Yeah.  For the end of the summer.  It's in its very early stages, but it could be really huge.  We were talking about our best body competition that we're going to be doing very, very soon.  The Teen Car Wash, very, very soon.  Sex for Sam 2, details about that, definitely on today's show.  And next week, we start the man-boob contest.  Yeah.  Guys about the man-boob problem.  We'll fix you up.  So, we're sitting around discussing all this stuff. 
[00:02:30]  Yes, Ben?  They can't.  They're in a meeting with the two big bosses.  Oh, really?  Oh, what is that about?  Oh.  I thought one of the two big bosses were sitting right here on this program, Ben.  Two of the three big bosses.  Oh, man.  This is going to suck, because we need them now.  Yeah.  Break into Ken Stevens' office and tell them we need Ron and Fez.  How important could it possibly be?  Yeah.  They're in there with Ken.  It's only their future.  Ken and Vizyarama.  That they're discussing right now.  Oh, it is?  I don't know.  Oh, what? 
[00:03:00]  Oh, maybe I should have kept that in my head.  Maybe you shouldn't talk about their future.  So, yeah.  One of the Ron and Fez muckety-mucks, he comes into the office with a camera.  And he was asking us if we would mind taking off our shoes and socks, because he needs  to take pictures of everyone's feet.  What the hell is that about?  When he came in, I'm just like, I said, look around this room.  Do you honestly think one person is going to take off their shoes and socks and let you  photograph their feet?  And it has something to do with what Ron and Fez are doing. 
[00:03:30]  They want to put, I don't know, pictures of everyone's feet up on the website, and then  the listeners guess whose feet is who.  We're looking at this kid like, are you insane?  So, I wanted to get Ron and Fez on the air to discuss that.  But they're in with the big bosses.  But they're in with the big bosses, right?  Well, we'll go to the phones until we get...  Hold on.  Oh, wait.  Ben's coming back.  What?  You got the power.  They're coming right now.  Ben's like, you got them.  Take them.  You got the power.  Crossover.  Two shows that like each other. 
[00:04:00]  Please, take advantage of it now.  Take advantage of it.  All right.  They're marching down the hall.  They'll take a call as they make their way to the studio.  Frank, what's going on?  Yo, what's up, Owen?  Hey.  Hey.  Hey, listen.  I was listening to yesterday's show about that four-foot pen thing.  What happened with that?  Or is it Ken still in the back office with that thing getting aroused with that four-foot  pick?  Good question.  The picture of Ken with the four-foot pen is on the website.  Yeah.  We will discuss what happened after the show, and it's some good stuff.  But first, we have Ron and Fez in the studio. 
[00:04:30]  Ronnie, Fezzy.  Hiya.  What's up, guys?  The straight gay radio team.  Oh, straight gay.  Hey, at least this time, I'm getting the straight thing.  Are you sure?  We have not confirmed that.  Last time, they called us gay and straight in quotes.  So, they got rid of the quotes, and now you're straight and gay.  The last post article was, one's gay, the other's straight?  Maybe, perhaps.  I'm not buying it.  He's telling people he is. 
[00:05:00]  Yeah, we saw that in the paper today.  The straight gay team.  I just want to start by saying goodbye to you guys.  I hear you're going to Tampa.  Yeah.  I want to wish you all the luck in the world.  Tampa, it's a different one.  Oh, it is?  Different part of Florida?  I'm not saying.  I read it on the message board, so it's got to be true.  Right.  That's all I know.  All I know is this.  The message board ends up being more true than not.  Oh.  A little.  Because these same rumors have been around for a long time about other stuff that turned true.  That's right. 
[00:05:30]  Something tells me that no matter what you write, over time it will be true.  That one time you guys.  That's right.  Yeah, what happened to you guys going to K-Rock?  That was never true.  No.  No.  Could have been true.  Are you still in negotiations with Spaz?  Yeah.  And Psycho Mark.  They went Spaz back.  Well, we want to know what the foot thing was all about today.  Honestly, do you think that we would think a great bit would be guest guy's feet?  No, that's why I was a little scared.  It's like, where did this come from?  I know you're under a lot of pressure, but... 
[00:06:00]  They have crap.  But I'm thinking, you know, Ron, he can hold it together.  They're starting to come up with some crazy bits here.  No, no.  Our interns run wild.  We have a producer who's very, very weak with the interns.  Yeah.  And the same kid deserved to be fired, I don't know, seven times.  Yeah.  I have said over and over again, send Puddin home.  Really?  Puddin is his thing.  Have you seen...  Yeah, well, you obviously have seen him.  Why do you call him Puddin?  Look at him.  That kid has made it entirely of tapioca. 
[00:06:30]  I have never met a softer person in my life.  He also ate 62 slices of a pudding cake.  Right, really?  Yeah.  Yeah.  So, two days ago, he took the bathroom key home.  And Feds can only go certain places.  Right.  You know me.  I'm P-shy.  He is.  He's P-shy.  You know that.  Right.  Because he thinks the urinal's sexual.  And, you know, everything's a problem for him.  And those urinal cakes, they're not really cake.  That's not a pastry.  Although Puddin was eating one. 
[00:07:00]  Tangy what?  Because it just had cake in the name.  Tangy.  Oh, yeah.  Now, he comes into our office.  Yeah.  And says that there's something going on in your show that you take pictures of everyone's feet that works here.  They will go up on a website.  And people will have to guess whose feet they are.  And he comes in.  And he actually thought that someone might bite and actually do this.  I think he's got a foot fetish.  We're going to guess people's feet from the radio anyway?  Yeah.  Yeah. 
[00:07:30]  See, it even gets better when you put it like that.  Sure.  I'm starting to like it.  What if we do the same bit with gonads?  Everybody, Ed?  Come on.  Who's yam bag is that?  Let's see your nads.  No.  But who came up with the idea?  Who came up with the idea?  He did.  That's his idea.  Interns run wild.  So we pitched the idea.  No.  He didn't pitch it.  He's on his own.  We said shock us, surprise us.  Oh, surprise us.  So he thought long and hard and came up with this.  Because he said that you guys sent him. 
[00:08:00]  Right.  Oh, yeah.  Well, that's a big good line.  No, we sent him out to do whatever he'd like.  Yeah.  And this is it.  I think he's on his way.  I think he's going for us.  Yeah.  That's the future radio you're looking at.  Show your feet now.  I love the kid's gumption.  I think he's got gumption.  I think he has moxie.  Moxie.  Yeah.  Chutzpah.  Opie, have you decided where you're going to put us?  Opie secretly controlling the radio station.  Yeah, that's me.  From behind the scenes.  Pull the strings.  Pull the strings.  I took a lot of calls today from Chick fans. 
[00:08:30]  I said, ask Opie.  It's up to Opie.  What do I know?  I'm not Opie.  That must be it.  I have nothing to do with anything.  Hey, by the way, who's the mole?  That's a good question.  Yeah.  Who's the mole?  Who's leaking information?  We have someone that works at this radio station.  We've got to make sure everyone in the other cities understand here.  A lot of turmoil around here in New York.  And there's someone that works within these walls that leaks information to message boards and stuff. 
[00:09:00]  Yeah.  Who's the mole?  And the newspaper.  I'll tell you who everybody thinks it is.  Who?  Who?  Rick.  Rick?  Rick.  Yeah.  I'm thinking it might be Earl.  Earl knows nothing.  But Earl doesn't know enough.  Right.  Earl's not smart enough.  Earl doesn't know enough.  No.  Earl's been walking around with a pair of tickets for two weeks.  Right.  And then he keeps asking us, Planet of the Apes, you interested?  Oh, yeah.  Ah, that's great.  Wait, what's that about?  He's pitching Planet of the Apes to everyone.  He's got the screening.  He's got tickets to the screening. 
[00:09:30]  That's happening.  And he just walks around.  So you need two?  How many?  Planet of the Apes tickets?  You need who?  I got.  He's walking around trying to give these things away.  That movie's going to blow, though.  We already know that.  From where?  Huh?  How are you hearing this?  Just because of...  Who's the mole?  Just because of how late in the summer it's coming out.  That's a good point.  So this summer has no great movies.  All the movies that they were expecting to do well, they released already.  Sure.  It better be good.  You think Jurassic Park is going to be good? 
[00:10:00]  No.  Although I'm going to go see it.  You think Planet of the Apes is going to be good?  I think it's going to be good.  I think it's going to be good.  Planet of the Apes, they say, is not even done yet.  Yeah, I know.  It's supposed to be released next week.  It's not even done yet?  No.  Oh, wow.  They had to push back the screening for the press because they are not done with the movie yet,  which is always a bad sign if they don't screen it for the press.  And, you know, Opie, I remember you saying that that Def Leppard movie wasn't going to be any good.  And that kicked ass.  And that thing rocked. 
[00:10:30]  The wigs look bad.  That's all.  The VH1.  The Spinal Tap wig.  You notice how everyone looked like Jay Moore.  They looked like Jay Moore in Spinal Tap wigs.  Everyone in the 80s did look like Jay Moore.  I did not see the Def Leppard movie.  And Anthony Michael Hall as Jay Moore.  The only problem is, because I'm a fan, I know that they took the wrong arm off Rick Allen.  It was the other arm.  Are you serious?  Yeah, they had the wrong arm.  It's a lot of things.  That's a film of the movie.  They call them film flubs.  You know what I noticed? 
[00:11:00]  Halfway through the movie, it was the other arm.  Right.  They changed it.  And they realized in one scene he'd be talking, and then they go to the back shot to look at the other person's face.  And the other arm's off.  And then once his leg was off.  Yeah.  At one point the arm grew back.  Yeah.  Nice.  So it was a flipper thalidomide arm.  Mm-hmm.  Just a hand coming out of the shoulder.  Right.  I haven't even heard that.  Me and my friends used to go through Time Magazine looking for Merck babies.  Merck babies.  Merck babies.  Oh, my God.  Remember Mercury Poison? 
[00:11:30]  Sure.  You know, when our phone would ring, it's your friend.  Merck baby.  Life Magazine, page 78, and I'd quick run out and get it.  Merck baby.  And any time one of these news magazines wants to do something on our thalidomide baby,  they always have them at the pool.  Right.  That's the irony of kids being born with flippers, then showing them in a pool.  They're great little swimmers.  Have you ever seen one?  Merck babies like to swim as well.  Like a bullet.  They don't need floaties.  Right.  Like a bullet.  Like a bullet going through.  They can move.  Less resistance, and they got the flippers already.  See how the ducks move in the water, right? 
[00:12:00]  Yeah.  Right.  Very similar.  If I had a Merck baby, I would just immediately tell him he's part dolphin right off the bat.  You're special.  You're special.  You're a dolphin.  Go back to your people.  I tried to drill a hole in the back of his head.  No blowhole.  Lori, what's up?  What's up?  This call's been distracting us here.  Lori, you're 15 years old.  You're calling from Cleveland, and what's going on?  Well, I think, you know, your show is...  You can say that in Cleveland.  Right.  Lori, you've got to watch the potty mouth.  We're responsible broadcasters here. 
[00:12:30]  So, all right, we rock, and what else?  Well, you know, I was thinking about a little contest thing, but I don't know if my dad's  listening.  Mm-hmm.  But...  What do you want to do?  You should have all girls call up and ask them how big the boobs are.  Oh, like a big boob contest?  Yeah, I think that'd be for me.  Wow.  All right.  That's almost as good as taking pictures of people's feet.  I like it, though.  Hey, that's going to work.  Yeah, but at least you could use your mind with the boob thing. 
[00:13:00]  Yeah.  And you're 15?  15?  15.  She's got 38 E's already.  Right, Lori?  Yep.  Don't say my name.  Can you, like, not say my name on the air or my age or something?  Don't say Lori.  15 years old.  No, don't say my age.  Okay.  Don't say you're 15, right?  She's the only 15-year-old in Cleveland.  That has big boobs.  Named Lori.  Named Lori.  Yeah.  With her father listening.  You got a younger sister?  I think you guys are so awesome.  Something in a D cup?  All right, Lori.  Lori, we'll let you go, okay?  Thanks.  Bye.  What school are you going to? 
[00:13:30]  She's a mess.  You know, maybe we could get her pictures up on that website we were just checking out.  Oh, my God.  What's that?  Lori, we've got a website for you.  You can send in your pictures, and it's all legal.  All right.  This is wrong, wrong, wrong.  Ron and Fez, you're going to love this.  Yeah, sure.  Ronandfez.com.  Let me get it up.  Yeah.  Bye.  All right.  Bye, Lori.  Look at the big boobs from Cleveland that's 15 years old.  Look how wrong this website is.  Look how wrong this website is.  This is under the guise. 
[00:14:00]  Let me tell you what these websites are under the guise of.  Okay.  Teenage models.  It's a whole thing called...  Look, I'll go to links.  She's a preteen, if anything.  Well, yeah.  Look.  Look at these links.  They're all teen models.  13, 12.  They got some 14-year-olds, but they're getting a little long in the tooth.  12's not...  Yeah, I don't like that.  12's not in the teen category.  Well, you know something?  They put it in the teen category.  Models.  Look at it.  Look at this one. 
[00:14:30]  Why isn't Fez checking it out?  Website coming.  Fez, he wants to...  Now, this one's a six...  He's like boys and goranimals.  Underoos.  Goranimals.  Goranimals.  This one is 16.  Yeah, she's a little old for me.  Yeah, a little older.  But this is all...  Somebody sent us, Rick, this link today.  They got girls just in provocative poses on the website.  It's very young girls in bikinis, and they're posing like very sexually. 
[00:15:00]  This reminds me of my last trip to Thailand.  I'll have to show you guys the slides.  That's good.  Look at the gallery.  She's my favorite.  Look at this picture and tell me this isn't porn.  Wow.  Oh, and they put a stuffed animal in the background.  Yeah, look, there's a little stuffed animal.  She's wearing a little pink number with a lot of blue eye shadow, and she's turned around  doing the over-the-shoulder, look-at-my-ass shot.  And how old is this little girl?  This girl's got to be 12.  Well...  She's 10. 
[00:15:30]  Turn that around.  She's 10?  Turn it around.  She's an old 10.  She's a 10.  She's an old 10.  She is a 10.  They're all 10s.  They're all 10s.  And you told me you needed this shot.  Oh, yeah.  Wow.  She's painting her legs up, and you have a crotch shot.  Yeah, she's doing a split, marking herself up.  In her little ballet leotard.  Painting herself up.  Anything where they're spanking themselves?  Look at that.  She looks like a heroin chic.  Look at that.  Yeah, she is.  She's heroin chic.  That's mental.  What's the website?  Because people are freaking out. 
[00:16:00]  If they want to check it out for themselves.  Okay.  Go to...  It's runoffez.com.  No, it's not.  It's not anymore.  It will be next week.  Uh-oh.  What do you want from us?  Okay.  Pre-teen models, you got it.  Mollirama.com.  Mollirama.com.  M-O-L-L-I-R-A-M-A.com.  And there's a links section that you go to...  It's got links to hundreds of sites that are just like this. 
[00:16:30]  Pre-teen girl models.  Models.  Who are the parents?  Look how it turned on Rick is.  He's pointing.  Oh, he's pointing because he knows all these.  Oh, he likes that link.  The girls, the Nickelodeon.  Jesse the Kid, Rick.  Is that the good one?  That's your fave?  Is that the good one?  Oh, nice.  Yeah.  Yeah, let's just click on her.  Oh, God.  This is wrong.  Look at these pictures.  I like that one.  They got them rolling around on the effing floor.  They got them dressed in provocative little clothing. 
[00:17:00]  Go back down.  Yoga.  Yoga.  Yoga.  Oh, you want to see her doing yoga?  Yoga.  All right.  Here she is doing a little...  Yoga.  There it is.  Doing some yoga.  Let's look.  Oh, Jesus.  Wait, she's wearing a little see-through black number.  How old is she?  That girl's less than 10.  No.  That was taken at camp.  The FBI on their way.  Now, I like when they're doing yoga, I like to teach them to bark.  If they can do that, I'll pay money.  How about number five? 
[00:17:30]  Number five looks nice.  Molly Rama.  Oh, hang on.  Turn around.  It's a self-munch.  Oh, my God.  It's the self-munch.  It's self-munching.  I don't know how these things are legal.  Oh, no.  Look at this.  This is illegal, isn't it?  I'm trying to teach my girlfriend that position.  Yeah.  It's mollyrama.com with an I, right?  Molly, yeah, with an I.  And then there's links aplenty on there.  Dude, there's tattoo links where she's got fake tattoos on her. 
[00:18:00]  Why should they be fake?  They should be real.  On her back.  Maybe they are real.  Look, there's a drug-taking section.  One of them's rainbow bright.  Look at this.  Look at this.  Look, look.  Oh, there you go.  An eight-year-old with a Goldberg tattoo.  She's got a tattoo right below her belly button.  Oh, but are you saying you wouldn't at least date her mom just to see her walking around?  You're insane. 
[00:18:30]  I don't know.  I was thinking about taking both of you swimming.  Maybe if the daughter was 15 and that daughter's nine.  Well, we broke the 15th thing.  That's over.  Hey, Matt, what's going on?  They call her Granny.  How are you doing?  Hey, good.  We're hanging with Ron and Fez.  They do the show right before us here in New York.  Before?  Which one's the gay guy?  There's no gay guy, is there?  We're not sure who the New York Post meant.  Yeah, the New York Post did a story on Ron and Fez today.  A little piece.  That's how I'm thinking.  And, yeah, they said Ron and Fez, the gay slash straight radio team. 
[00:19:00]  Uh-huh.  But we don't know which one's gay.  You know, hearing Fez talk, it makes me question my sexuality to just listen to him.  Because you're digging it?  Where does that come from?  Where do the rumors start?  Ron and Fez talk, Ronnie's thinking of suing the Post.  I'm going to tell you that about him.  Yeah, I'm that angry that everyone thinks I'm the gay guy.  All right, Matt, thank you.  Well, let's go to Gallery 8.  Gallery 8?  Sorry, I hope we haven't let go of it yet.  You like that? 
[00:19:30]  Yeah.  8-A-T-E?  You can't click on this one until you become a member.  That's a thing.  Which, at that point, guys in bulletproof vests bust through your door.  Who's going to sign up for this?  Yes, I want Gallery 12.  I like her in that little bikini number.  And here's my credit card number.  Right.  Yeah, yeah, here's where to get me.  Yeah, right.  I'll put in my address.  The site is probably just bait.  Yeah, no kidding.  You're just baiting them.  Of course.  Those guys are all gacked up 3 o'clock in the morning.  Oh, God.  Yeah.  Oh, Lord. 
[00:20:00]  I'm going.  Well, I mean, they want their kids to be models.  It can't be, um, this can't be legal.  They're in very provocative poses in very little clothing.  Who sent you this link?  Can't be legal, right?  It can't be.  Go to uncleshatehair.com.  That's where I am a member there.  Hey, Will, what's up?  Yeah, what's up, guys?  Yo, what's up, Martin Fez?  Yeah.  Look, I'm going to do you guys a favor.  Okay. 
[00:20:30]  I'm going to save you an hour and a half of your life.  Do not go see Jurassic Park 3.  You've seen Jurassic Park 3?  Holy God.  It's horrible.  Hold on.  Hold on.  But you please hold.  That's on mollyrama.com?  Well, this is a link off of Molly Rama.  We're in so deep to the labyrinth now, Opie.  I don't know where we are.  Well, this is this fat chick.  This is some fat broad in a tiny little bikini.  That's baby fat.  Right.  You know that'll get worn right off.  But look at this picture.  I'll show you one. 
[00:21:00]  You can follow along at home.  This is go to the Kirsten's bedroom link of Molly Rama.  And you tell me this picture.  The guy taking this picture isn't going,  Now you stand out by the rail.  I don't want to snap your picture.  What part of the south is this?  Oh.  Y'all stand out by the rail.  Make your daddy and mama proud.  Looks like Tampa.  It does look like it.  And it looks like it.  And I bet, you know,  her white trash mama's on the other side of the door  holding their clothes all happy. 
[00:21:30]  She's a model.  My baby got to be a model.  My baby got to be a model.  You're so pretty.  You're going to end up on the next Skinner album, honey.  Will, what's up?  Yeah, yeah.  I'm still here.  I just want to let you know about Jurassic Park.  Jurassic Park 3, that bad, huh?  It fucked my ass, bro.  Yeah?  It was terrible.  You've never seen crap like that.  The dinosaurs are...  They talk now, right?  Making noise of each other.  Sam Neill, the Indiana Jones ripoff dude.  Yeah.  He winds up making the vocal cords of the raptors, 
[00:22:00]  and then he can blow at it and communicate with them,  and they understand.  Oh.  Stop it.  Horrible.  How ridiculous is that?  They're still going to go see it, Rod.  I'll never...  I've never missed a Jurassic movie.  Don't.  Don't.  I was ripped, and it still sucked.  How pissed off were you?  I was mad.  Eight friggin' dollars in an hour and a half of my life,  I'll never get back.  There you go.  All right, Will, thank you.  All right, take care, guys.  I think he liked it.  Oh, really?  He's talking to the raptors. 
[00:22:30]  We should take a break.  It's mollyrama.com.  Yeah, M-O-L-L-I-R-A-M-A dot com.  And the site can't be legal.  It cannot be legal.  I would love...  These parents should be reported.  Got to be.  Because it's under the guise of teen models.  But what preve isn't spanking it to these pages?  Someone wants to know if it was Jim Norton's homepage.  Yeah.  All right.  Do you guys have to... 
[00:23:00]  Yeah.  You have to go back...  Oh, back into the office.  Back into the office, yeah.  Ken Stevens and Jeremy.  We have to go meet the other two bosses.  Yeah.  Right.  Hope if it's okay with you.  What have you decided?  The whole iron triangle won't be there.  Seriously, what have you decided?  Before I go in and talk to the puppets, what do you want?  Tell us what we're going to do to make you happy.  What would you like?  Oh, that's nice, Ant.  All right.  Now we got little girls eating bananas.  And that girl's seven. 
[00:23:30]  It's nutritional.  It's nutritional.  They say fruit's good for you, right?  One of the basic food groups.  All right.  You know, let's blindfold her and try to guess the fruit.  This guy's got an interesting thing.  Hold on.  Let me go to Brett.  Hey, Brett.  What's up?  Hey, guys.  How you doing?  Good.  Hey, listen.  I met a girl on the internet.  I've been talking to her for close to two years.  What's his name?  And that, well, on the internet, it's sweetness.  Right.  Oh, sweetness.  Hold on.  We know sweetness. 
[00:24:00]  We know sweetness.  From Minnesota?  No, Ohio.  Oh, there's more than one sweetness.  Is she a fat girl?  And, um.  There's a, this girl's sweetness.  Well, she just got into the business.  Oh, no.  This girl is a fat pig with huge boobs that just gets naked every night on the internet.  There's a little petite girl that's got three children.  Oh, yeah?  And, um, she started doing stuff, and I just recently, I haven't been in contact with her  for a year, and I just got back in contact with her, and I was like, where are you going? 
[00:24:30]  She goes, well, I got a job to do.  I said, what are you doing?  Get to the point, God damn it.  All right, Anthony.  Jesus Christ.  She does these sites.  She does this?  Dresses up like a little girl and does these sites.  Oh, no, these aren't people dressed up like little girls, believe me.  This isn't Lily Tomlin as Edith Ann.  Right.  Which even turns me on.  I don't know why.  Big rockin' chair.  Look at the size of that rockin' chair.  That's funny.  She must be young.  The rockin' chair looks huge.  So, Brett, you're trying to say that, what, she's an older lady and she could... 
[00:25:00]  She's 34 years old.  And she could look like she's 15, 16?  That she's 16, 15, sometimes 14, and she gets these guys that call her up and she does...  They pay through a PayPal account, and then they go and they can view her on the site.  When you're telling these little stories, here's a good idea.  Have a point.  It makes it so much more interesting for the listener.  Oh, my God.  All right, what are these?  We're looking at it. 
[00:25:30]  I don't know.  Rick came in.  He typed in another website.  And it looks like family fun at the nudist camps.  Oh, jeez.  Family fun at the nudist camps.  Fez, don't worry.  We'll go to billyrama.com to satisfy your needs.  I hope so.  Satisfy your needs.  Billyrama.com.  It's naked softball, Fez.  You'll love it.  T-ball.  How old is this picture?  Look at that big 70s Earth Mama Month.  This is fun at the nudist colony? 
[00:26:00]  Yeah, but these are adult girls.  Look at that.  She looks like a stand-in for an Austin Powers movie.  She made it into a heart, though, Anthony.  Yeah, that's a big heart.  Right.  She's got the hair that trails right up to her belly button.  Hey, Scott Calhoun didn't have a heart that big, honey.  It goes up to her heart.  All right, we've got to take a break.  All right.  You guys want to come back after your meeting?  We'll be escorted.  I've got to go to Jurassic Park 3.  What?  We'll be escorted out after this meeting.  Hey, you get a nice place down there in Florida. 
[00:26:30]  Are you going to let us visit?  Yeah, sure.  Because I really like Florida.  It's nice, nice weather.  Sure, Ann, because you always hang around with us off the air.  I know that about you.  Hey, you know I do.  We spend so much time together now.  You know I did when you were doing late nights.  He's saying off the air.  Off, yeah.  When we're, yeah.  Yeah, well, that's true.  When you're drunk and we have a microphone, you're all our best friends.  Right.  What do I have to have for you?  Who else hang?  Does Opie hang out with you off the air?  Yeah, we go places all the time.  Sure.  Oh, I don't mean visiting the office. 
[00:27:00]  I visit their office.  They visit our office.  Yeah.  Although, if we get Anthony to the beach, we could get a picture of those feet.  Again with the feet.  Hey, look at you bringing the whole break right back.  Yeah, thanks.  Thank you.  That's good radio, man.  Full circle.  It's a package.  It's a callback.  Put a ball on it.  Let's get out of here.  Let's go to Sparks.  I come by to the office and grab some of your beer from the fridge.  Well, we're not there.  We built for your fridge so bad.  We're beating up interns over that.  It's you guys.  All right. 
[00:27:30]  All right.  We got a break.  Thank you, Ron and Fez.  All right.  Let's go.  Well, there's radio.  There's edgy.  There's psychotic.  And then there's O&M.  The Opie and Anthony show.  You guys are an undisciplined child wielding ultimate power.  Hi, Anthony Paisano of Mulberry Street in the heart of Little Italy.  Yes, I was just there last week.  Were you really?  Yeah.

[00:29:00]  Opie.  Yes.  Those teen model sites.  Yeah.  I did a little research, found out who they were registered to.  Paula Poundstone.  Can you believe it?  Her name was popping up all over those things.  Jesus.  That's sick.  Christy, what's going on?  Hello?  Hi, Christy.  What's up?  Um, Tuesday when I was listening to your show, um, after the last time me and Ashley called,  this guy called us a bitch. 
[00:29:30]  Yeah?  Who is that?  Bitches.  Of course not.  I don't even know who you are.  Whatever.  Which Christy are you?  This is Christy from Dallas.  How are we supposed to remember you?  Well, I called like six million times.  Do you remember Christy from Dallas, Ant?  It's really not.  No.  I remember a girl named Ashley that was really hot.  Was that your friend?  Yeah.  Yeah, she's really hot. 
[00:30:00]  You don't know that.  She told us.  She said you were the dumpy one.  Oh, I remember you now.  She sent a picture.  Right.  Whatever.  You're a little chubby.  It's all right, Ant.  It's all right.  I don't know.  You can tell people it's baby fat.  Because you're only 18, so you'll be all right.  We all see it.  We all see it.  Hey, thanks, Puck.  Remember that line from Puck?  Yeah.  Hey, Chubs.  All right, Christy.  Thank you.  That's all you want to say after 45 minutes on hold? 
[00:30:30]  You just want to tell people.  You're not a bitch?  Well, yeah.  Okay.  Because I'm not.  All right.  Yeah, I can tell by the tone of your voice you're not a bitch.  Yeah.  Sure.  Whatever.  Anything else, Christy?  We've got to do a radio show.  Well, she also said that we had like a weird laugh.  That wasn't me laughing.  All right.  All right, Christy.  Thanks.  That was Ashley.  Good thing you got that straightened out.  We could look past the wacky laugh of Ashley because she's, you know, kind of high. 
[00:31:00]  I didn't know 18-year-old girls were a prime demo we were shooting for down there in Dallas,  but we'll take them.  Yeah, sure.  We'll take them any way we could get them.  All right, Christy.  Thank you.  Okay.  We look forward to your next phone call.  Okay.  Great anticipation.  Yes.  Bye, Christy.  Okay.  You suck.  Thank you, Christy.  Thank you.  All right.  So, someone asked about the four-foot pen with Ken Stevens, our boss.  Yeah.  Yeah.  And it's official. 
[00:31:30]  We have signed our contracts, Anthony.  Yeah, we did that right after the show.  Right after the show.  And then we boosted it up with the boss, telling all sorts of fun stories.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, we were sitting there with Ken and one of the head sales guys.  Jeff.  Jeff Hedges, who is...  I don't know if anyone knows him as a character here on the...  Oh, yeah.  Well, Jeff was falling asleep, though.  You notice that?  Was he?  Was it the scotch?  He was nodding off.  I'm like, oh, my God.  This is the guy that's supposed to sell our show nationally, and he can't even stay awake 
[00:32:00]  past 930.  But I got to give him a lot of credit.  He woke up in time to pay the check.  That's always good.  And that was a big check.  Just footing the bill.  It was one of those, like, little clubs.  You know those cigar?  It was a cigar joint.  Brandy clubs?  Yeah.  We just kind of sit down.  It's very dark.  A lot of dark wood.  And lighting, very dim.  Little couches and small little itty-bitty tables. 
[00:32:30]  Looked like a library.  There was books all over the place.  Yeah, there was books all over.  Sure.  Yeah, a lot of people smoking the cigars.  Oh, yes.  Let me tell you.  It was back in Africa.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  I had nothing but my sidearm, and I was being charged by a giant rhinoceros.  Oh, my God, McBrag.  What did you do next?  Well, I pulled out my rifle.  That's what it reminded me of.  The world of Commander McBrag.  You remember him?  Sure.  And there were animal heads all over the place.  Yeah, it's just that kind of atmosphere that you'd sit around and tell stories. 
[00:33:00]  There I was, Libya.  All of a sudden, the German hordes were marching at me, and I had nothing but my sidearm.  Oh, my God, what did you do, McBrag?  I fashioned a bazooka out of a piece of pipe.  He always, like, got out of it.  And the guy could always tell McBrag was full of crap.  Yeah.  He goes, oh, that's a fascinating story, McBrag.  Yes, quite, quite.  You know what I'm saying?  Quite.  But even the guy knew.  I fastened a flying device out of some leaves. 
[00:33:30]  And I flew over the hordes.  Yes, yes, of course you did, McBrag.  Oh, whatever did you do?  Like, the guy's all sarcastic on him and stuff.  So after our little get-together after the show yesterday,  it was getting too late to jump on a train back to Long Island.  So I have to stay in the city.  You stayed in town last night.  Got to do it.  But I wasn't prepared to stay in the city.  As you will notice by the same clothes I'm wearing today that I did yesterday. 
[00:34:00]  Now, Opie, Manhattan, New York City here, very hard to get a room at the last minute.  A lot of people like staying here.  Right.  There's a hotel I frequent.  I just figured they'd have a room for me last night.  Right.  Oh, they were sold out.  Uh-oh.  They were sold out.  Now I need to find a new hotel.  And I'm a little buzzed and a little tired, and I just need to find a room.  So you didn't want to start making calls and find another hotel.  So I went to the crack hotel across the street. 
[00:34:30]  I can't believe you stayed there.  Ben was mortified.  You stayed at the crack hotel?  Ben prides himself on knowing New York and knowing where, like, the hip clubs are.  Yeah.  He'll tell you where all the cigar joints are.  He knows all this crap.  I know.  And if you need a good room.  He knows where the hip hotels are.  He knows which hotels you should stay away from because, you know, as Ben said, the sheets are filled with...  I didn't say it, so don't dump out. 
[00:35:00]  Ugh.  Man batter.  Man batter.  Man batter all over the sheets.  So, uh...  Ugh.  So, I was tired, and my, you know, no rooms in the hotel I used, so I went across the street to the crack hotel.  Did you see one of those real tight, curled-up black pubes on your pillow?  There's nothing worse than knowing that a Hasidic Jewel fouled a hooker there about an hour before. 
[00:35:30]  This place is such a dump.  Ugh.  Such a dump.  And I'm in the lobby, and you get all these...  You get all the rubes from all over the place that are coming to New York for the first time, and they...  Because this hotel is close to Times Square, they're assuming it's a good hotel, because the lobby looks good.  Yeah.  It's Art Deco, Anthony, I believe.  Oh, yes.  Art Deco.  Yeah, they make the lobby look good.  That means they just haven't remodeled it since Art Deco was new.  These people have no clue what the rooms look like until they get upstairs, and they're in for a rude awakening. 
[00:36:00]  Here's the key to toilets down the hall.  Sheets are ten bucks extra.  It's one step above that.  Yeah.  Seriously.  We had...  There's a rotary phone.  Mm-hmm.  There's a rotary phone.  There's a rotary phone in the room, right next to the bed.  Huge, huge mirror.  Uh-oh.  Huge mirror.  That's a bad sign.  You can see Opie asleep in his hotel bed on the internet somewhere. 
[00:36:30]  Huge mirror.  Yeah.  I mean, it was the whole wall.  After signing his very lucrative contract, Opie decides to spend in the tens of dollars on a hotel room.  Staying here in midtown Manhattan at the Flush Crack Hotel.  No expenses spared as man batter stains abound. 
[00:37:00]  In this luxurious crap hole.  You'll know what you've gotten yourself into when you grab the sticky doorknobs.  and that mirror next to the bed  full of video equipment  and for a special surprise  open the closet  you'll see a dead hooker  freshly killed 
[00:37:30]  the crack hotel  you just signed your contract  let me get this straight  right after the show  we just signed our deal  feeling pretty good about ourselves  and you stay at a crack hotel  basically  the air conditioning was busted  so I'm sweating all night  sticky sheets  located near the Carnegie Deli 
[00:38:00]  for all your pot needs  and I also knew that I had to wear  the same clothes today  so I wanted to keep them nice and fresh for today  Opie's wardrobe never getting in the way  look at this closet  full of nothing  so we wear the same cigar smelling shirt  he wore last night  and my underwear  and my socks  I didn't want to sleep 
[00:38:30]  I didn't want to sleep in that stuff  I hate sleeping naked  ate it  and I had to  had to  had to  had to sleep naked  don't like sleeping naked  had to sleep naked  the HIV in that bed  oh my god  beware of hepatitis B  dude  wait a minute  had to  why?  had to keep the undies fresh for today  that's all I had  what are you doing in your sleep  that wouldn't keep them as fresh  as when  before you slept  you know  you sweat a lot during the day 
[00:39:00]  I had to kind of  you know  rinse them out a little bit  and put them on the  on the heater  like a soup kitchen  in your pants  you're a pisser  wait a minute  but  remember the sheets  the undies  you know  they kind of look like  used shoeshine rags  you know  take care of stuff  and  I would have slept  had to  in my clothes  in the bed  shoes  everything  I  no  the AC  I finally got it to work  and I got it blowing up some air 
[00:39:30]  to kind of keep my clothes fresh  airing out the clothes  the sheets  didn't fit the  the mattress  so I woke up in the middle of the night  just sleeping on this crappy mattress  sweating like a pig  oh my god  wait  the bare mattress  oh yeah  oh  you got a disease  you have a disease  it was the worst  the W  you know  outside my window  where most hotels serve crabs 
[00:40:00]  in the dining area  Opie got his in the bed  all this and  complimentary bloodstain removal  a place to hang your underwear  while you sleep naked  in our petri dish bed  all at the crack hotel  in midtown Manhattan  any stray pubes 
[00:40:30]  Ben thinks  Ben thinks  that this hotel  is used by all the hookers  the drive-by hookers  that we were talking about  a few weeks ago  oh yeah  oh yeah  no doubt in my mind  and yeah  the W was flashing  outside my window  all night long  the neon light  he's like  oh I can't even get to sleep  so then I wake up in the morning  just drenched in like  sweat  on the mattress 
[00:41:00]  just think if you were in there  with a hooker  what they did before that  leaving all kinds of body fluids  body fluids abound  in this luxury suite  so  so I go downstairs  and I get the paper  and I go back upstairs  and I'm reading about us  in the post today  did you put the paper  down on the floor  so your bare feet  wouldn't hit the right  and uh  and I had to laugh  because  I have to laugh  there's an article  in the post  about  Rush Limbaugh  signing his  contract 
[00:41:30]  for 250 million dollars  that's right  and our big boss  saying that he would have  doubled his salary  if he  you know  would have called him  I think Mel was  joking but  and then um  and then they  they talk about  some of the infinity properties  yes  some of the infinity  syndicated shows  and they mention  the Howard Stern show  I miss  and radio's  fast rising  dynamic duo  Opie and Anthony  I'm reading this  in the crack hotel  this morning  laying in a crappy bed  covered in your own sweat 
[00:42:00]  right  with the light blinking  outside your window  reading how you're  one of radio's  dynamic duo  right  up and coming stars  I'm like  man I might as well  just have a freaking  needle in my arm  look at this place  watch out for the syringe  oh man  I had to laugh  I'm reading  and uh  yeah  there I am  that is something man  after signing 
[00:42:30]  his lucrative contract  he took off  his underwear  and retired  in the man  batter  stained bed  I had to rinse  out the underwear  first  in front of  a big mirror  who knows  what's behind it  all kinds of  wonderful video  equipment  as you were  watching the porno  movie in your room  you were the porno  room  movie in 315  you checked

Hey  First of all  I love you guys  but I got a funny  ass story to tell you  Yeah  I work for a  computer network firm  and as part of our  service we monitor  other people's networks  and every month 
[01:20:30]  we put out a report  of all the sites  that their employees  go to  Yeah  Yeah  Tell me about it  That's your job?  That's my job  To screw over employees  We actually make money  out of it  because there's  certain employees  that I get to know  and I get to see  all the crazy sites  that they go to  and then some of the  ones I'm friendly with  kind of asking for  some money to make  sure their employers  don't get to see  certain sites  Really?  They drive you  to get rid of  their history?  Oh yeah  I've had people pay up  like 50 to 100 bucks 
[01:21:00]  to clear their history  because it's crazy  ass sites  anywhere from like  gay porn  to like  That would have  been embarrassing  insane stuff  Gay porno site  It even gets worse  because the software  that we run  we can actually read  every email  that they send out  Man  Whether it's on  Hotmail, Yahoo  or even on their own  like private mail servers  So anybody that's  working out there  they gotta be careful  You never know  who's watching  Alright Toast  Thank you  Hey take care guys  Alright  That's an interesting job

[01:39:30]  it was close  convenient  I had no change  of clothes  I did have a toothbrush  and that was about it  yeah  the trick is to  wash your butt  in the sink  and you ditch  the underwear  is that it  there's a lot  of schools of thought  here  you put two bars of soap  in your shoes  the night before  alright Jay  I know you can't  oh that's a good one  Jay I know  alright I know  you haven't been  listening to the show  tell me what I should  have done  because I think  I played it perfectly  okay  I'll give you the details  really fast  why couldn't you shower  no the shower  was no problem  I'll tell you  what the deal is  alright I'm in the

[01:42:30]  people right now  are honking their  horns  that's right  it was the night  before my birthday  I was 17 years old  it was literally  like 1130  before my 18th birthday  and I remember  just sitting there  tank  in the  in the tank  hammered  going  dude  check it out  you wait a half hour  you don't have  to call my parents  why don't we  just sit around  take it nice  and easy  and you can  try me as an  adult 
[01:43:00]  and I'll tell  them I'm going  back to my roots  on the bus  I was actually  just a drunk  17 year old  like I mean  come on  who can lie  better than me  I'm sitting  there looking  at the cup  dude  half hour  half hour  and I'm an adult  help me out  and a trip  to the restroom  you know  come on man  help me out  how'd you get  nailed  I was like  I had 10%  blood in my  alcohol  I was so drunk  I'm lucky  I didn't kill  somebody  really  and what  were you  just weaving  all over  dude  I felt like  I was on the  water  I have no  it's a miracle 
[01:43:30]  I was alive  at that point  wow  one of the best  things that ever  happened to me  so you live and learn  pushing me to a lot  of cool chicks  on the bus  on the way to  Montclair to work  at J.B.  Winberry's restaurant  what is the scariest  run in  I got pulled over  with my sister  my license was expired  she couldn't drive  so I was driving  her home  we were at like  a big family party  it was like  three years ago  and we were on  287 in Jersey  like in the middle  of nowhere  and this cop  pulls us over  and he's like  you guys been  drinking right  I'm like no  I haven't 
[01:44:00]  she has  I'm driving  because she's  you know  I'm being  I'm being  responsible officer  like you know  your license is  suspended  I'm like yeah  but I mean  what do you want  me to do  I don't want  my sister  to like  kill people  you know  so the guy  takes me out  of the car  and like  takes me to the  back  and he goes  so you know  your license  is suspended  and like  totally normal  and cool  I just go  I know  I just don't  want my sister  to you know  injure anyone  including herself  is there any way  you cut us a break  and the guy  takes his flashlight  and lifts it up  like a bat
