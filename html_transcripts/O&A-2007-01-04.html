<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opened with sexually explicit and offensive banter between Opie, Anthony, and Jim Norton.  They immediately transitioned into mocking the recently fired hosts of "Beaner and Ken," playing audio clips of their reactions and criticizing their promotional photo.  A caller, Sam from Syracuse, was interviewed, with the hosts making racially charged comments about his appearance.  Speculation about the reasons for "Beaner and Ken's" failure followed.  A significant portion of the show then involved a humorous, and degrading, search for the source of a smell in the studio, which included sniffing colleagues' clothing and discussing Opie's poor housekeeping.  Anthony recounted a traffic stop, detailing the encounter with racist and offensive commentary and offering a self-serving explanation of his perceived unjust targeting for using his cell phone without a hands-free device.  The hosts also engaged in sexually explicit discussion about a naked woman visible from their studio window, detailing their voyeuristic observations of her daily routine.  The show then briefly mentioned upcoming weekend programming and planned segments.

The next segment featured Jim Norton describing his unusual "swim walking" exercise routine.  The hosts then joked about how the Syracuse callers might misinterpret the show based on the earlier segments.  Patrice O'Neal was mentioned as a recent guest.  A substantial portion of this segment focused on the "Subway Superman," analyzing his heroic actions, the subsequent media attention, and questioning whether he was a genuine hero or a kook.  The "Anthony Clock," tracking Anthony's lateness, was a recurring topic. Other discussed topics included a meteorite striking a New Jersey house, the destruction of Steve Irwin's death footage, a cursing children's toy, dangers in children's sippy cups (sugary drinks), and an audio clip of the "Courteous Cabbie," known for his excessive politeness and 9/11 commentary.  The Trump-Rosie O'Donnell feud and speculation about President Bush's reaction to Saddam Hussein's execution video were also discussed.  Multiple audio clips were played, including a promotional message from Louis C.K. for his HBO special.

A subsequent segment began with a discussion about Paul Hintersteiner, a New York City taxi driver who received an award for professionalism, contrasting his behavior with other cabbies, including recalling a fight between two at XM.  The conversation shifted to popular online videos: a "baby bird" video involving eggnog and vomit, and Saddam Hussein's execution video, comparing their relative popularity on YouTube.  Callers and hosts discussed other trending videos, including a dance video and a "Lonely Girl" video.  Jim from Philly called to mention a trending Tara Reid New Year's Eve countdown video.  The Trump-Rosie O'Donnell feud was heavily discussed, with audio clips of Trump's criticisms and various caller opinions.  Barbara Walters' role and past interviews, including a humorous clip of her attempting a pole dance, were mentioned.  The hosts then discussed their missed opportunity to promote the band Cold War Kids, highlighting their success despite the hosts' initial rejection.  The segment concluded with casual conversation about holiday movies, the appearance of a homeless man (Andrew) in the studio, a brief argument about a host's (E-Rock's) weight, and an advertisement for a "Money Snatch" segment.

A significant portion of the show focused on the "Box of Cox" bit and its potential cancellation.  The hosts joked about using a Jew to find missing money, and then debated the bit's removal, expressing frustration with XM executive Elo.  Callers and hosts speculated on Elo's concerns, ranging from obscenity to legal issues.  They brainstormed increasingly absurd and offensive alternatives.  Elo called in, explaining his concerns about legal ramifications and the potential for attracting the bomb squad.  The hosts pressured Elo, ultimately negotiating a 24-hour deadline for a solution.  The discussion included numerous vulgar and offensive jokes, references to pornography, and homophobic slurs.  Listener calls, a brief discussion of a rap song for staff member Roland, and a brief appearance of a studio audience (who left early for a tour of 30 Rock) were included.  A caller's description of a listener who posted "I love dog shit" online led to a discussion of other listeners and their strange behaviors. The segment concluded with a deadline set for resolving the "Box of Cox" issue.

A lengthy, sexually explicit interview with a couple married for 30 years dominated the next segment.  The hosts aggressively questioned their sex life, focusing on the husband's penis size, the wife's aversion to anal sex, and various sexual practices.  Vulgar language and graphic descriptions characterized the conversation.  The wife's use of Kegel exercises was also discussed.  A musician, Pat from Long Island, called to promote his band, Hijinks.  The conversation then shifted to the band's name, influences, and experiences.  The hosts announced their adoption of a chimpanzee, Baluku, through the Jane Goodall Institute, and detailed their plans for an "E-Rock Radio" segment focused on listener comments about E-Rock's weight gain.  The segment ended with a discussion of the "line of the day."

The final segment featured a punishment for E-Rock, a 15-minute segment where listeners called in to insult him about his weight gain.  Opie and Anthony recounted a near-stabbing incident before starting the punishment.  E-Rock sat with a tire around his waist while enduring highly offensive and insulting calls, using derogatory terms about his weight, appearance, and genitals.  The calls ranged from mild ribbing to extremely vulgar abuse, with Opie and Anthony interjecting comments and laughter.  The phone lines jammed due to the high call volume.  After approximately six minutes, the segment concluded with further comments from Opie and Anthony, including a plug for another show.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  It's the Opie and Anthony show on XM202 featuring Opie, Anthony, and James Norton.  The most annoying thing on two legs.  What a whore fest.  Who cares about the funny?  Just bring me the porn.  Aren't we dumb?  Hee hee.  Opie.  Opie, do you want to play?  Anthony.  I will beat children about the head.  Jim Norton.  I'm dancing.  I'm dancing.  I'm just, I'm a naked whore.  It's indescribable.  I'm trying.  It's like a rape that's covered by insurance.  Some of the comments they make are uncalled for. 
[00:00:30]  Why are you crying?  The virus finally hit him.  Well, with Jimmy, you never know.  It could be AIDS.  No.  Yes, yes.  It's the Opie and Anthony show.  The virus that spreads from town to town across the U.S. of AIDS.  I hate you.  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road.  Good morning. 
[00:01:00]  Good morning.  Hi.  You're about to listen to the Opie and Anthony show.  The ONA virus spreading across America.  We say hi to Syracuse this morning.  Hello, Syracuse. 
[00:01:30]  How are you?  Welcome.  Welcome.  Our phone number, 1-866-313-FREE.  That's 1-866-313-FREE.  It is a virus.  You're going to like this show.  I could just picture the guy right now.  Somebody is going,  What the hell is this?  What is this crap?  No worries.  Like he hates us already,  and we just said good morning. 
[00:02:00]  There's somebody.  You guys suck.  You know, I gave you guys a shot.  I heard good morning.  Uh, and you just suck.  What are we replacing?  I don't know.  What are we replacing?  No idea.  No idea.  Don't care.  A rock and a plant.  I think it was another morning show.  Oh.  But we say hi to, uh,  Oh, wow.  Wait, no, you know?  Sam knows? 
[00:02:30]  This is Sam Syracuse.  We're not sure if he's black or white.  He's white,  very light-skinned,  yet he has black man's hair.  Uh,  and not just curly hair,  like on a white guy.  Right.  Um, don't, don't think we would,  we would say he,  he's kind of black and kind of white  if he just had curly hair.  That would be silly.  He has black person's hair,  yet it's light hair,  but it's completely,  um,  nappy. 
[00:03:00]  Yeah, he's got,  yeah,  he's got big bushy eyebrows, too.  He's light-skinned.  Very light-skinned, though,  but there's just something.  And he's got big bones,  big bone structure on his face.  Yeah,  there's just something going on  we can't quite figure out.  Kind of ape-like.  There you go.  You're,  what adorable.  He's very, very firm,  uh,  his cheekbones are kind of red,  he's a little embarrassed right now.  Sam's shy.  Yeah, he is.  My girlfriend thinks Sam is adorable.  Aww.  Anyway, Sam, 
[00:03:30]  uh,  what's going on in Syracuse?  What do you know?  I believe we're replacing  Beaner and Ken.  What?  Who?  Beaner and Ken.  You never heard of him?  What?  Who's,  no,  I'm,  I'm really,  I'm serious.  Not the Beaner and Ken.  Beaner and Ken.  Look,  it's a popular radio thing to do,  um,  if you hear of a radio show  to say,  oh, 
[00:04:00]  I never heard of those guys.  A lot of jocks say that.  It kind of undermines the show,  makes it seem less important  than it is,  things like that.  So when you would say,  what?  Beaner and Ken.  Beaner and Ken.  Normally,  jocks would go,  oh,  I've never heard of them.  Even if they did,  because radio jocks  are lying sacks of crap.  Um,  but I swear to you,  I can swear  on every living relative  I have  that I have never heard of,  uh,  what? 
[00:04:30]  Beaner and Ken.  Beaner and Ken.  Beaner and Ken.  I actually have.  Well,  you,  of course,  have.  You've toured the nation,  Jimmy Norton.  I lied.  Oh,  you're lying.  Of course,  I'm lying.  Of course,  look at his eyes.  I can tell now.  What was,  look at Jimmy's eyes,  you know,  when he's lying.  He's still,  I couldn't,  I just look at him  as sweet puppy dog eyes.  I don't see deceit in them.  What was the big  Beaner and Ken bit?  They get up at 6,  6 and they go home at 10.  6.  Get up at 6. 
[00:05:00]  Get up at 6.  I had like a 3 hour sleep  last night.  I don't remember  specifically any huge  bits they had.  They never made  a huge impact.  They were there for about  2 years more or less.  Yeah.  They played music and  Oh,  they played music also?  And talked.  Intertwined in there.  All right.  Yeah.  All right.  Well,  Godspeed,  Beaner and Ken.  Well,  on their website,  it says,  to our fans, 
[00:05:30]  thank you for all the support,  but in radio,  you never get to say goodbye.  Oh,  we would let them say goodbye.  Yeah,  Beaner and Ken  could call up right now.  Come on,  they're sleeping in.  What are you kidding?  Merry Christmas  and Happy Holidays.  Keep watching this site  for news on where  you can hear us next.  To our fans in Syracuse,  we hope you'll enjoy  the Opie and Anthony show.  Oh,  thanks,  Beaner and Ken.  And that's Beaner and Ken  being very nice.  That's nice of Beaner and Ken.  And we decided to start our show  by trashing guys  we've never met before.  We never met that  because, 
[00:06:00]  again,  radio people  are scumbags.  You know,  we're trashing these guys.  We've never met them.  I know.  They're out of a job  because of us.  They're fired.  They're trying to figure out  how they're going to pay  their bills for January  and we go right after them.  And why should we,  we know what it's like,  Ope,  to be fired.  Why should we revel  in other people's  misfortune  with being fired like that?  That's terrible.  They might be nice guys,  but on their website  it says,  Beaner and Ken,  there's two smiley faces  inside a wreath. 
[00:06:30]  Their heads are surrounded  by a wreath.  That is true.  That's why.  I just glanced over  and saw that.  And their heads are touching.  Yeah,  guys,  let ONA  give you a little advice.  Never get  within  three feet  of each other  for a promotional  photograph.  Ever.  And touching  is completely  out of the question.  Opie and I  have been together  on the air  for probably  a dozen years  and we have  never touched. 
[00:07:00]  Never.  In real life.  Never mind  in a photo.  No,  we did one  of those  handshake  hugs  after Letterman.  It was a handshake  and the pat  on the back  leaving plenty  of room  between us  for anybody  that would want  to slip in  like young  James Norton  or anyone else.  But absolutely,  you don't take  pictures like that.  I don't think  we've ever  high-fived.  No.  I think we've  shook each other's  hands a couple  of times over the years.  We do that.  Were they 
[00:07:30]  syndicated anywhere  or is that it?  They were a  one-market dud.  Don't say that  about Beener  and Ken.  They wished us well.  They were a  one-market dud.  We usually call  them one-market  sensations.  They were syndicated  all over America  and you know.  You know,  just pick a city  and there's  the one-market  sensation.  They're great  in that city  but they've  never done  anything else  outside that city.  Beener and Ken 
[00:08:00]  were the  one-market dud.  We have a little  audio from the  general manager  as they were  leaving.  We're tanks  for nothing!  That doesn't  seem very nice.  And is this  Beener or Ken?  This one.  I don't know  the audio but  Don't you do it!  Don't you!  Oh, that's Ken.  I got nowhere  else to go!  Yeah, that's Ken.  Oh, okay.  I got nowhere else  to go!  Oh, and here's  Beener.  You can act 
[00:08:30]  like a man!  What's the  matter with you?  The upside-down E  and Beener and  Ken there.  Oh, wow!  I did not notice  that young Samuel.  It's a Beener.  Beener, the E's  are fine.  The E's are fine  on the Beener name  but Ken, for some  reason, has decided  to flip over his E  which is...  Wait, I...  Hold on.  Let me reach over  here.  I haven't used this  in a while.  Wait, blow it  off.  Blow it off.  What?  No, you know.  Oh, yeah.  It's a little dirty.  Okay.  Hold on to your 
[00:09:00]  seats.  Thank you.  Nothing says  good logo  like an upside-down E.  Not only just  one wacky horn  toot or two  wacky horn toots.  Let me give him  a little of this.  You're not going  to give him that.  Yes.  No!  It's an upside-down E  for God's sake.  All right.  Go ahead.  I'm giving him  the three sound  of the salute.  All right. 
[00:09:30]  There we go  for the upside-down E  in Ken.  Well, let's get  Beener and Ken.  Far thee well,  Beener and Ken.  Let's get them  on the phone  before we never  talk about them again.  We now have  O and A  in Syracuse, people.  Yeah.  For better or worse,  you're stuck with us  for a while  until we take  the old  Beener and Ken  Express out of town.  Well, this is  from the Post Standard.  95X's morning duo  silenced by low ratings.  Oh, no. 
[00:10:00]  Guy, Beener, Patton,  and Ken Huron  tried to lure back  Howard Stern listeners.  Oh.  95X morning duo  Beener and Ken  are packed and gone.  Did they have a hole  on their show?  No.  Perhaps that was it.  Perhaps their show  is conducive  to having a chick  sit in with them  and maybe they'll  do that next.  I think it's important  to get a lady's  perspective in the morning.  Yeah.  So when the other guys,  when maybe Beener  is talking to Ken  about something 
[00:10:30]  that's a little risque,  she could go,  hey,  oh, guys,  now.  Oh, that's a little much.  Oh, stop.  Because everyone knows  any show that's just guys,  it stinks.  Yeah.  You need the girl in there  to give her point of view.  Well, girls are always funny.  I mean,  they were in high school.  They were the funny ones.  Of course.  I know this is riveting radio  and all, but...  What's the problem?  I see you, like...  Who smells like  a rotting diaper?  Who the hell? 
[00:11:00]  All right.  Hold on.  Hold on.  I smell very nice.  I have...  I smell good.  I have my...  No, man.  Speed stick.  That's the best...  I mean,  if we were over at XM,  I would explain further,  but someone smells  like a rotting baby's diaper.  Uh-oh.  Is it me?  Hilarious.  It could be, too.  I don't...  Why does that smell?  I don't smell anything, 
[00:11:30]  to tell you the truth.  It's over here.  Come over here.  Did you step on...  Did you step in dog duty?  No, I actually just sprayed  static stuff on my shoes  because I get shocked twice  when I get up.  People don't know...  When you get up,  sometimes when you walk  on the carpet,  I get zapped in my ear  because of this little  static electricity.  Wait, wait.  I spray for that.  Yeah, I've heard of  when you touch the doorknob,  you get a little spark  or something,  but you get zapped  in the ear from what?  Always when I get up.  What are you touching  your ear to?  No, through the headset.  Oh, I thought you meant  I thought you were making breakfast  with your ears. 
[00:12:00]  When I do that wacky  answer the iron trick  in the tub.  Everyone check their shoes.  I'm not kidding.  Someone has like  rotting baby diapers.  Not me.  Clean.  Are you sure it's not  the alcohol?  The anti-stat?  I don't know, man.  Smell your mic.  Oh, God!  Is it your microphone?  No, that's just bad breath.  Oh, God!  I'm getting electric toothbrushes  for everybody. 
[00:12:30]  I've got to be honest.  I'm way over here, but...  No, it's over here somewhere  and it went away,  so it was somebody  that came over here  to give me something.  So that's either...  Oh, no.  Okay.  Clubs are to Kenny.  I hate to say it,  but maybe Fan.  Everyone's going to have to...  Steve...  Walk by now.  Or Sam.  Why doesn't everybody  walk by me?  I have an extremely  good sense of smell.  All right.  All right.  Here comes the...  Smell the back  of their jeans.  No.  Of course.  Why would Kenny... 
[00:13:00]  Kenny has no odor at all.  There is no worse smell.  He's not alive.  I saw all the mics.  No worse smell  than the smell  of the swamp.  Steve smells okay.  Crack.  Steve smells a little  like ethnic food  of some sort,  but not bad.  Ethnic food.  That's horrible.  A hallway in a tenement.  Yes.  Something's cooking  and it's awful.  Will you take one  for the team  and smell the back  of their jeans  because I'm at...  Back of their jeans.  Because I'm sitting  a little lower over here.  You're smelling  where they're throwing 
[00:13:30]  on deodorant  and cologne and crap.  I can smell  a good sense of smell.  I don't have to bury  my nose in their jeans.  Huh?  Exactly.  If it's that rampant  where you smelled it,  I don't think...  What?  All right.  Yeah.  Craig, our intern,  that'll pretty much  do anything.  That's what lowly...  Basically,  if he doesn't do anything,  he's gone.  That's the only reason  I can keep him around.  Everyone line up.  Steve, Kenny,  Stan, and Sam.  All right.  Bend over.  All right.  Look at Kenny.  A little too eager 
[00:14:00]  to bend over.  Ankle grabber.  All right.  Craig, smell the back  of his jeans.  Wait.  Get a mic on, Craig.  How does Kenny smell?  Kenny smells fine.  All right, Kenny.  You're free to go.  Kenny's checked out.  All right.  Now here comes Steve.  Steve, bend over, man.  Steve looks way  too comfortable  to bend over like that.  Steve has a good arch  in his back.  And then he did a little dance.  Steve's got a good arch  in his back?  Yeah.  He bent...  Steve pushed his ass out 
[00:14:30]  and he just arched  his back a little.  It was like a lower...  Oh, no.  That's not a good sign  there, Steve.  That's perfect leverage  when you're slamming  backwards.  You don't tip over  or knock your gentleman  friend back into something.  All right.  Here's Stan.  Stan refuses to bend over.  Good boy, Stan.  Smell fun.  All right.  Oh, God.  And I hope it's Sam.  And here comes young Sam.  Young, tiny little Sam.  Nothing.  No.  Damn it.  What is it, man?  All right.  Check, Opie.  Could it be you?  Did you shower? 
[00:15:00]  You're not smelling me.  I showered.  Okay.  I've been wearing  the same jeans  for three or four days, but...  That might do it.  No, I do the sniff test  before I throw them on.  You don't have seven jeans?  Seven jeans?  What's that?  Like, seven pairs of jeans.  Oh, I thought you meant...  At least seven.  I thought you meant...  One for every day.  Oh, the new style,  seven jeans.  Yeah, no, no.  No, I've never heard of them.  Yeah, I do, but, you know,  I don't know.  Yeah? 
[00:15:30]  I'm sick of doing laundry,  so...  I just...  I just like...  Why are you still living  like you're in college?  Because that's the way  I like to live.  Just milk crates  full of your valuables  and two jeans?  Well, the dresser  I finally bought,  the faces of the drawers  are all off the dresser.  And I spent good money on it,  but I got ripped off.  What do you mean?  Wait, they ripped out?  Yeah, you know when you pull  the drawer... 
[00:16:00]  Yeah, the drawer handles.  Open, yeah.  The whole front of the drawer  came off,  so now what you have  is a thing of shelves.  Yeah, I got three  out of the six  have fallen off.  Moveable shelves.  How long have you had it?  Too long to bring it back,  unfortunately.  And then, like...  Did they rip out, or...?  They were, like, staples.  Oh, man,  that's some cheap stuff.  And where'd you get it?  How do you open a drawer?  Do you put one foot  on the bottom drawers  and grab the top two  and yank as hard as you can?  I got it on 72nd.  There's a nice furniture  store over there.  It's not bad. 
[00:16:30]  Apparently it's not  that nice if it's stapled.  No kidding!  Wow.  And then, you know,  you put your clothes  down in the drawer.  Yeah.  That material  is, like, sagging.  It's just particle board.  I don't even think  it's that good.  It's, like, paper thin.  It's, like,  really, really hard cardboard,  it looks like.  Oh, yeah.  Wow.  But then you look  at this dresser,  you know,  it looks like  a really nice dresser.  How much did you pay for it?  I don't remember anymore,  to be completely honest.  I got...  I remember that it was,  it was, you know,  it was up there.  I spent a lot of pressure  because I've done that 
[00:17:00]  for years.  I've had dresses that do it.  Yeah.  Just get a good dresser  where all your clothes go.  You know what I like to say?  You get what you pay for.  I've never heard that.  See, for me,  it's just the opposite  with sex.  It's you're going to pay  for what you get.  All right,  let's say hi  to Tim in Syracuse.  This is our big  Syracuse Open.  Yeah, it is.  Tim, what's up?  Hello.  Hi, Tim.  Hey, Tim, let's go.  You're on the air.  What's up, Tim?  There we go.  Oh, my God.  Those guys from Syracuse, 
[00:17:30]  they were horrible.  They took over  after Howard got kicked off  and it was,  you listened to them  for five seconds  and you just want  to change the channel.  Oh, no.  We have audio.  We're getting some audio  of those guys, right,  off the website, Hawk?  Why?  Why are we going to beat them up  now that they don't have a job?  They don't have a job,  the poor guys.  I don't want to beat them up.  How about we beat up  someone that's actually  still on the air?  Yeah, who's on the air  in Syracuse?  It's Scorch.  Are we against Scorch?  Are we competing  against Scorch?  Hey. 
[00:18:00]  Kingdom of nakedness.  Unfortunately not.  Naked militia.  Naked mayhem.  Scorch moved  to Manchester, New Hampshire.  All right,  get us Manchester,  New Hampshire.  I want to kick Scorch's ass.  Love Scorch.  Oh, man,  I listen to you guys  every day driving into work  in the Philly  and if I laugh  my brains out,  oh, Syracuse.  Thank you,  you jerk off.  Hey, Tim,  for all of Syracuse,  why don't you tell  the new listeners  what they can expect  from the Opie and Anthony show?  Yeah.  Oh, my God. 
[00:18:30]  He was winding up  with an oh, my God  and everything.  Like, oh, my God,  where do I begin?  Where do I begin?  And he's still talking  because he thinks we care.  He pulled under the shoulder  to let that one fly.  Oh, my God.  Let me look over here.  Do I start with wow?  Do I start with blank in the box?  All right.  Sam?  I think one of our competitors  on I think K-Rock  in Syracuse  is a young lady named Ty  who hosts her own morning show.  Oh, well, 
[00:19:00]  we couldn't possibly  beat up on a girl.  What does that board do?  What's the big bit  that she does?  I'm not familiar.  She started  three months  before I left Syracuse  more or less.  Yeah.  She goes by  Ty Rocks a lot.  Ty.  What?  You got one?  Punch it up over there.  Ty Rocks.  Ty Rocks a lot?  No, no, no.  A lot.  I'm saying frequently  that's what she goes by.  Ty Rocks.  Which one is she? 
[00:19:30]  She's the  she's a redhead.  Right there?  Yeah, she's hot.  All right.  She's kind of cute.  But does she do good radio?  Damn, that sucks.  I was hoping she was a pig.  I don't like her dumb  sultry face.  Her sultry eyes  irritate me.  So she pretty much  just plays a couple tunes  and acts sexy, right?  Spins some records.  That's about it.  Yeah, she's a master  of the angled photo  because if you keep searching  you'll find a few pictures  where she doesn't look  quite as nice.  You're right.  The angled photo. 
[00:20:00]  The MySpace photo.  Which, yeah.  You have to take that picture  of just an eyeball.  Or, yeah,  you take a picture  from above.  You hold the camera  up to your right  and you aim it down at you  and you kind of glance up  in a sexy fashion.  Yeah.  Makes your eyes look really big  and go-like.  That takes away  a lot of the sag  in the face.  Let's say hi to Matt  in Syracuse.  Matt, what's up?  How you doing, guys?  All right, Matt.  I just wanted to welcome you  to Syracuse  on behalf of all of us 
[00:20:30]  to help the friggin'  horrendous, cold, dark winter  that is living in Syracuse.  Yeah.  I just wanted to let you guys  know that you'll be appreciated  that you got rid of  the Beaner and the Ken.  It was bad times for everyone.  I feel bad for Beaner and Ken.  We wish the best  for Beaner and Ken.  I'm sure Bob Eatman  will pick him up.  I'm sure he already has him.  Yeah.  Does he?  I'm not even saying  that as a joke.  Does he?  I hope it ends  in a murder-suicide.  Of Bob Eatman. 
[00:21:00]  It already happened  to Bob's personality.  He shot it  and then it killed  his charisma.  How great would that be?  A murder-suicide.  Has it ever happened  with the radio partners?  Radio pair?  I have no idea.  Radio duo?  Yes, it did actually.  The Hitler and Eva show.  It's very popular  and popular for a few years.  Well, I talked to a paper  in Syracuse yesterday  and they asked if we were  going to have a big Syracuse open.  There it is. 
[00:21:30]  That's it.  Yeah, that's all we got  planned for you.  Effers.  Now you just sit, listen,  catch up, shut up,  listen, and enjoy.  All right.  We got to take a break.  When we get back,  we got to talk about  E-Rock discovering  a new naked chick.  E-Rock is one of our staff here.  People from Syracuse.  His name is Eric.  He's barely part of the staff.  He's useless.  He's barely part of the staff  at this point.  Just waiting for one of these  other guys to get a little better.  Look at Sam  just chuckling along with us. 
[00:22:00]  Because Sam knows.  Sam's a bright boy.  He threw his head back  and laughed,  a hearty laugh.  Sam's a bright boy.  You know, I...  Sam looks at E-Rock  like a gazelle,  like a wounded gazelle  near the water.  I am thrilled  that the station  that we first came to  here in New York,  1027.  What?  1027 here in New York.  What?  I am thrilled  that they have come up  with a brand new format. 
[00:22:30]  I just saw the commercial  for it.  Oh, they're already  running spots?  Yeah.  There's something  about that logo.  It looks like a...  It looks like a Christmas ball.  Either a Christmas ball.  I thought for a second  I looked up  and I saw fresh 1027.  It looks like soap.  It looks like a soap commercial.  Well, the logo's probably  supposed to look fresh.  Fresh.  Like a fresh, clean bubble.  Oh.  Hey, have fun over there.  Yeah, no kidding.  We did.  We'll explain that 
[00:23:00]  on another day.  Yeah.  They've gone through,  I think, five formats  since getting rid of us  back in the day  for our Son of Sam 3 promotion.  All right.  Anyway,  so much inside stuff here.  I understand Syracuse.  Just hang in there.  Just hang in.  Just be quiet and listen.  That's right.  And someday  we might even explain  all these people  that are around us.  It's the Opie and Anthony Show.  When we get back,  E-Rock discovers  a new naked chick  and doesn't really share with us  until she...  Because she puts a... 
[00:23:30]  Yeah.  Well, we'll get into it next.  Also, Anthony got pulled over yesterday.  It's a hilarious story.  We got to talk about Trump and Rosie.  We got to talk about the subway hero.  He's a kook, I tell you.  A kook.  Enough with the subway Superman.  And other things  that we'll just pull out of our  you-know-whats  to make this an entertaining radio show  this morning.  It's the Opie and Anthony Show.  Hear what everyone else is talking about.  O&A Uncut and live  continuing the show  on XM Satellite Radio  starting at 9 a.m. Eastern.

[00:24:00]  It's the Opie and Anthony Show.  Coming this weekend on XM 202,  it's a Saturday Night Virus double feature.  This Saturday from 9 to 11 p.m.  is the return of the Than and Sam Show.  And from 11 p.m. to midnight,  it's Big Cat's Geek Stuff.  It all happens this Saturday night  on XM 202.  We're back with the Opie and Anthony Show.  Thanks for checking us out this morning.  Starting up in Syracuse today.  We're very excited about that, by the way. 
[00:24:30]  I get to work.  I go to the office.  I'm like, where is everyone?  Where?  Who the?  What the?  We usually all gather in the office  around 5 a.m.  to get ready for this show.  I walk in.  Getting a circle.  Zip.  And no one is around.  Yeah.  I hear some commotion coming from this fine studio  that we broadcast from.  And everyone is up against the window  checking something out in the darkness.  Yep.  We have this huge window here. 
[00:25:00]  and it overlooks pretty much  a lot of midtown Manhattan,  a lot of windows to check out.  A lot of apartment buildings  and one of which is very close  to our building.  Close enough anyway  where we can kind of see in the windows.  Nothing beats the old studio, by the way.  The old studio,  we were no more than 20 to 25 feet away  from the building.  Yeah.  We would look out this window.  They had a whole row of windows  that were bathrooms.  We saw so much great stuff every afternoon. 
[00:25:30]  A lot of fun stuff.  A lot of women coming home  and getting ready for a happy hour.  Yep.  Oh, and were they getting ready for a happy hour?  So many women preparing to get lucky out there.  Doing all sorts of things in the bathroom  with razors and such.  Shampoo bottles.  Oh, my God.  We've been following Exercise Bike Girl  for a long time.  Exercise Bike Girl.  She gets on her exercise bike  and does a headstand.  She's a mess, by the way. 
[00:26:00]  She's a little on the high-end side  when it comes to her bottom end.  She's a little heavy.  And she wants people to look  because she has no shades,  no curtains, nothing.  No, she turns the lights on.  It's pitch dark.  It's still last night when we get in here.  It's dark out.  So when you turn a light on,  that's all you see.  It's like a glaring light  and you can see completely inside their apartment.  And we see some naked women occasionally.  Not dumb.  We've only seen the one so far. 
[00:26:30]  We've seen her.  Well, so far,  we've only seen the bicycle girl.  She does the bike,  then does a headstand  for about five minutes,  which is really weird.  Goes into the bathroom,  comes out completely naked,  and then just walks around her house  completely naked for a while.  Well, she's not that proficient with a razor.  We've noticed that.  And she's a little high end on her backside,  a little fat,  but not bad.  And anything naked like that,  that voyeuristic thing,  is kind of cool. 
[00:27:00]  That's great, sure.  It's kind of cool.  So this morning,  we're hanging out in the office,  and Iraq comes running in  and goes,  another naked girl,  a different one  in a different apartment.  So we all come Taryn in here  and take a look,  and she's wearing a shirt.  She's got the shirt,  you know,  that hangs down low enough  where it's hiding everything.  And she's just kind of strolling around.  And we're like,  what the hell is that?  And we realize,  Iraq must have been standing there  soaking up the nude girl, 
[00:27:30]  gawking,  instead of pulling the alarm  when you should have,  when she was naked.  No, that's not what happened.  But how long were you watching her naked  before you came in and told us?  Maybe five seconds  before I came in and told us.  I will not believe that.  I will not believe that.  There's no way you look for five seconds  and then run away.  We're walking past the big window here,  and she's got her,  I guess,  the mattress in the living room,  which is where she's right there.  Yeah, it's her bedroom.  She might be a new tenant.  This might be a goer. 
[00:28:00]  This might be new,  because, yeah,  it's the living room  is the big room with the light,  but she's using it as her bedroom.  So her bed is right against the window  when she wakes up  and turns that light on  and she sleeps naked,  Iraq?  Yeah, apparently.  She got up out of the bed  and went into that little room  on the side.  She sprinted in five seconds?  No.  When he turned,  she was already standing there.  So I ran in to get you guys.  We came back.  We were waiting for her  to come out of the other room,  and she had an over shirt on.  Iraq,  an over shirt?  What was it?  An over shirt?  It was like a guy's shirt. 
[00:28:30]  He was a spa humbug.  Yeah, exactly.  She took her nightcap off.  Over shirt.  I think, yeah,  I think he's...  Iraq is always thinking  of the right thing to say.  Yeah.  You know what I mean?  Because the reality is  if I'm in here by myself  or Anthony or any of us  and we see a naked girl,  we're not running  to get everybody else.  We are taking it in for a while.  Absolutely.  I'd give the yell.  And then we will share with others.  I'd give the yell.  So for him to say that...  Go, naked girl!  For him to say that,  you know,  he would look for a couple seconds 
[00:29:00]  or whatever  and ran and got us  within five seconds,  it's just a flat-out lie.  I would look,  and then you'd say,  why did you throw yogurt  on the window?  I'd say,  well, I was watching  for a few minutes.  And she was probably  on a pogo stick  causing a real ruckus  and he was enjoying it.  Watching the whole thing,  she put her shirt on  and then he came and got us.  So you got a glimpse  and she had a shirt on?  Yeah, not too bad.  I took a look  and not too bad.  I couldn't get  a good enough look, though.  She, like I said,  had her shirt on  and she never turned around 
[00:29:30]  to face the window  and then went back  into the bathroom.  And now I guess  her lights are off.  Is she gone?  Where is she in relation  to the other?  Early riser.  Pretty close.  Down one  and over one  to the left.  Yeah, and there she would be.  They're relatively close, so...  Yep.  Good.  And she's an early riser.  The other one  gets up a little later.  Yeah.  The bicycle girl.  E-Rock, we want  a full report tomorrow.  Okay.  I want you to stay  on top of this.  It's very important  for the show.  Film it.  Film it.  Do whatever you have to. 
[00:30:00]  Well, that might...  Break whatever laws  you seem to.  That might break  a few laws, I think.  Why?  Filming out your own window?  Actually, to tell you  the truth,  I don't think it is  breaking a law,  but it's an iffy area.  Well, I think if...  When we put it  on the internet,  then we'll be...  Then there's a problem.  Right.  If we just share it  amongst ourselves,  walk into the bathroom  for a few minutes,  share it.  Anyway, that's the latest  outside the window, I guess.  Yeah, the outside the window  naked woman game. 
[00:30:30]  All right.  Anthony, what happened  after work yesterday?  I already know.  Jimmy actually doesn't know.  Jimmy doesn't know.  I went home.  Cool.  Went to sleep.  Nothing to do.  Next subject.  Well, yesterday,  and this is after  all of my hubbub,  my hullabaloo  that I made  about making sure  you have your ID card  with you at all times.  Remember the other day  we were talking about  how much of a pain  in the ass it is  in these buildings  to get in?  Everyone's got security cards.  They're all different 
[00:31:00]  for all different buildings.  We do a show  from two different studios  with two different buildings.  You get these big,  thick, magnetic strip cards,  and it makes your wallet  like five inches thick  to stick in your pocket,  and you've got to remember them  because the building security  won't let you up.  Opie was talking about it  when he forgot his wallet  one day  or forgot his ID,  and the security guy  wouldn't let him up.  He sees them every day.  No, it was around Christmas,  and I had Christmas presents  up at the XM Studios,  and I happened to be  in the area,  and I wanted to just  go upstairs really fast 
[00:31:30]  and get Christmas presents  for people  that I needed to give them  on Christmas morning.  Yeah.  So I walk in the building.  I didn't have my building IDs  because on the weekends,  like you said,  because there's so many,  I kind of just take them  out of my wallet  and throw them on the counter,  and so I walk in,  and I just go,  I don't have my building ID,  assuming that would not  be a problem whatsoever  because the guy sees me  every day,  and he stops me  and gives me a big problem.  We told the whole story  the other day,  but basically he wouldn't  let me upstairs.  I'm like,  you've got to be kidding me.  You see me every day, 
[00:32:00]  and he said something like  he might get in trouble,  and I'm like,  you're not going to get in trouble.  I work here.  They're a pain in the ass.  And when we do the walkover,  by the way,  we walk over to XM,  you guys always say hello to him.  Not anymore.  He's a scumbag.  Never acknowledge him.  Now you never will again.  That wasn't the problem I had.  You didn't listen to my story.  You assumed I had a problem  with that nice gentleman  at the XM building  that I greet  with a fine hello every morning.  No, I didn't.  Oh.  What happened?  Well, I was talking about  the fact that you should  always have your wallet 
[00:32:30]  and your ID  and your cards with you  at all times.  Just had the conversation.  Just had the conversation.  On Tuesday.  Always.  And what did I do yesterday?  I left my house.  I realized about 15 minutes  into my 20, 30-minute commute  here in the morning,  I realized as I'm doing  about 95 miles an hour  that, oh my God,  I left my wallet at home.  So I have nothing.  I have nothing.  I keep some cash  in my pocket  but I don't keep it 
[00:33:00]  in my wallet.  So I had some money  but I had no ID  whatsoever on me.  Nothing.  So I made it in  and as I was leaving,  I pull my truck out  onto 57th  and there's a police officer  in his car  clearing out  what is the taxi  and bus lane.  It's all the way  to the right  on the street  and it's just for taxis  and buses.  Regular cars,  no, no.  Parking there,  no, no.  So this cop  has his lights on  and he's going  from car to car 
[00:33:30]  pulling up behind him  getting out of his vehicle  and yelling at the people  to move their vehicle  from the lane.  They're stopped there  you mean?  Yeah.  Okay.  Which is fine.  You know,  that's his job.  Whatever.  So I'm on the phone  with my girlfriend  on my cell phone.  I have my Escalade phone  which you just press a button  and talk like a lunatic  to yourself  and that's fine.  You can do that.  But I have my cell phone  because I was trying  to line up  the goddamn Syracuse interview.  I couldn't tie up my...  You know,  this is all that stupid...  What's his name?  What's his goddamn name? 
[00:34:00]  The Syracuse guy?  William LaRue.  You're a douche.  He's listening right now.  I could.  William LaRue  is a douchebag.  He's a douchebag.  He's from the Post Standard  in Syracuse.  Why is he a douchebag?  Because he almost  got me arrested yesterday.  Oh, and he doesn't  even know it.  Doesn't even know it.  Now that I think about it,  it's his fault.  That almost didn't  come out of fault.  It's the old  William LaRue.  The old William LaRue.  Okay, Pookie. 
[00:34:30]  Tell the story.  Now, I didn't want  to make a call  on the Escalade phone  because I was waiting  for Billy Boy,  Billy, Billy, Billy,  Billy LaRue.  Billy, Billy,  LaRue.  To call on the Escalade phone.  So I had to use  my cell phone  to call my girlfriend.  And I always,  you know,  in New York,  it's illegal.  You can't drive  with the cell phone.  So this cop  is kind of next to me  as I pull  near his car. 
[00:35:00]  He steps right out  into the street.  I saw him, though.  I said,  uh-oh,  wait a minute, baby,  cop.  So I put the phone  on the seat.  You do a little drop.  Yeah, you do the drop.  He steps right in front  of my truck.  I jam on the brakes  and he turns  and looks at me  and I'm just looking at him.  He didn't even look.  He goes right out.  So he crosses  in front of my vehicle  and starts now going  to annoy some other  double-parked person  on the other side  of the street.  I pick my phone up. 
[00:35:30]  He catches a glimpse  of me picking my phone  up in my side-view mirror.  So he starts coming for me  and he's on foot.  He starts coming for me.  So I look  and I step on the gas.  I'm like trying  to get away from him  but there's a car  in front of me  not moving  and I think the light  was red.  So he goes,  hey, hey.  He's a black gentleman  and he's yelling,  hey, stop.  And at this point  now I'm committed.  I'm pot committed.  I have to just run.  I have to now leave. 
[00:36:00]  You're all in.  I'm all in.  It's all in.  I'm going.  So I step on the gas  and he has just enough reach  to bang on the back  of my vehicle  and I make like  I don't see him nothing.  So I'm back on the phone  with my girl  and I go,  I better hang up.  I think there's a cop  after me.  So I hang up  and next thing I hear,  whoop, whoop, whoop,  whoop, whoop, whoop.  He's in the oncoming  traffic lane  yelling at me 
[00:36:30]  to pull the F over  at the next light.  I'm like,  oh boy, I'm screwed.  So I pull over.  He gets out screaming at me,  cursing.  He goes,  didn't you see me?  Didn't you see me?  You pull over  for the F in police.  You don't.  So instantly  I concocted  a little story in my head.  I said, sir,  very respectful.  I never like yell  at the cops or anything.  I said, sir,  I assumed  because you  would step down  in front of my vehicle  and you were 
[00:37:00]  paying attention  to that van  that was double parked  that you just wanted me  out of your way.  I go,  I thought you were  telling me to leave  and get out of your way  so you could cross the street.  So I kept going.  He was so frustrated  at that.  Why?  I think because  it sounded legitimate enough  where he knew  it would hold up in court.  It was one of those  situations where  it's like,  damn it.  Maybe because he's a cop  and he knew you were lying.  That too. 
[00:37:30]  So he goes,  give me your license.  And now I reach  and go,  funny story.  I go,  I don't have  my license with me.  And dude,  you know me  every day.  The last time  I didn't have my license  or wallet  or ID with me  has to be  10 years ago.  I have it  every day.  And he just,  he loses his mind.  He goes,  why doesn't that  effing surprise me?  Why doesn't that  effing, 
[00:38:00]  and then I went,  sir,  I have it every day.  I'm trying to sell him on it.  Why are you using  a stereotypical black voice?  Because that's how he sounded.  I'm doing an impression.  Lordy, lordy.  Lordy, lordy.  He never said  lordy, lordy.  I'm not doing an impression  of him saying  lordy, lordy.  He didn't say that.  But he then  looked at me  and said,  you're lucky  the computer  in my car  is broke.  And I said,  I could call  somebody right now  and they will  assure you  I am licensed. 
[00:38:30]  And he just went,  and that's when he said,  you're lucky  the computer  in my car  doesn't work.  And he just walked away.  How relieved were you?  I was kind of pissed.  Really?  Yeah.  I kind of felt  like a black man.  I knew what it was like  to be a black man  being hassled by the man.  Well, you are Sicilian.  I'm Sicilian.  And you know,  the Moors.  You drove away  and called you to stop  and you sped to a red light.  What a black man.  You were doing something wrong.  You were illegally  talking on your phone.  Here's what.  The officer asked you to stop. 
[00:39:00]  You ignored him.  He hit your van.  I ran from the cops.  What are you, a horse?  I thought he was yelling  giddy up,  so I continued.  Let's figure out  how many laws you broke.  Let me tell you something.  Red light,  cell phone  with no hands-free  or Bluetooth.  and leaving  and running from the cops.  And running from the cops.  And you're racist.  Right.  And you're a racist.  Yes, this is me.  I had a bunch of illegal Coors,  you see,  in the back of my truck  and I had to get it  on time 
[00:39:30]  to text Arcana.  Why are you on the phone?  Because I'm thirsty, dummy.  Dummy.  I had to get to Georgia  and you know  you can't take Coors  east of the Mississippi.  And it was  a very harrowing experience  where even I thought  to myself,  the officer hears him  walking up to my window.  That's an attention getter.  Well, that's when he was banging.  I asked him why he banged  on the back of it.  And thank God 
[00:40:00]  he was a little hungry  and let me go.  Let me have a Diablo sandwich  or Dr. Pepper  and make it fast.  I'm in a goddamn hurry.  And it ain't sure  a time to get there.  I know.  The computer  in his car was broken  but was the radio?  See,  that's what makes me think  he kind of knew  He knew you were  just a waste of time.  It was just like  I know a few people  like it would just be  a waste of time. 
[00:40:30]  Kind of.  He could have hassled me,  believe me.  He could have arrested me  right there on the spot.  Could have arrested me.  It would have been  a big pain in the ass.  But I think  he didn't want  to get into it.  So basically  you're saying  that he knew  that you were  more powerful  than he was.  No,  I am not saying that.  Let me tell you something.  When I drove away,  even I,  even I,  who you know  just I have this feeling  that Patrice  has said this in the past,  Patrice O'Neill.  I have this sense  of entitlement 
[00:41:00]  that he looks at me  and just goes,  you have this  white entitlement  that you feel  you just have.  And even I,  as I was pulling away,  it went,  wow,  you really think  you're above the law,  you idiot?  What are you doing?  You were on the phone.  I was an idiot.  And you even just  said in the air,  and that boy  knocked on the back  of my car.  I could have you  shot for that.  You were wrong.  You were on the phone.  Of course I was wrong.  I understand the wrongness  of what I did.  You should be happy.  But I was very happy 
[00:41:30]  that I was let go.  But let me tell you something.  Not bad at the guy.  Let me tell you something.  This guy was angry  before he even saw me.  I saw him going down that line  because the traffic was moving  at the same speed he was,  so I was kind of next to him  for a while,  and I'm watching him  just really,  he was mad that day.  He woke up pissed.  How great is it  to be a cop, though?  You're annoyed.  All you gotta do  is just scream at dirty,  awful cabbies  and other people.  That's what he does, yeah.  How great is that?  And then he just screamed at me. 
[00:42:00]  And at one point,  a little fleck of spittle  came out and hit me  on the cheek.  So as he's talking to me,  I just slowly took my knuckle  and wiped it away,  and I think that annoyed him, too.  Which car wash  did you stop on  on the way home  to wash your body?  I purelled my face.  Knowing you.  Went through a car wash  naked to get  the dirt off you.  When you said,  why doesn't that  effing surprise me,  you should have put  your finger up like,  I have an answer,  because you're black 
[00:42:30]  and most black people  never have their ID.  Wow.  That's what you  should have said to him.  Let's go to Eric  from the NYPD.  Mr. Ballsy on the radio.  Eric!  Hey, what's going on, guys?  What's up?  He's been keeping track  of your violations.  All right, Eric.  Based on your story,  I can get you on five.  Five?  Which ones?  Let's see.  Well,  failure to display license,  failure to display  your registration  and your insurance.  Uh, hold on, friend.  I have my registration  and insurance.  So you keep that  in the car  and on your wallet?  Yeah. 
[00:43:00]  So if someone steals  your car,  they can prove  that they borrowed  the car?  Yeah, they could prove it.  All right, fair enough.  Good for them.  Let me tell you something.  99% of the people  in this country  keep their Reggie  and insurance  in their vehicle.  Oh, I'm just saying.  I know,  but you can take  those two off.  We got you down  on three  and the three we get you,  we can get you on points.  Yeah.  We got the red light,  failed to comply  with the lawful order.  Yeah.  That's when him  telling you to stop  and see.  Now, I could have  fought that in one,  believe me. 
[00:43:30]  I almost,  he walked in front  of my vehicle  and believe me,  when he tapped  on my vehicle,  I was absolutely sure  he was telling me  to continue to go  because I was in his way.  Right, right.  And that would have held up.  Oh, wait.  I gotta go.  Talk to you guys later.  Uh-oh.  Steven from Bayshore  on the instant feedback.  He's got a call.  Smokey and the Nazi.  I'm not a Nazi.  I'm just a fan of the era.  Oh, well,  Syracuse is learning  about the show this morning.  Yes, Anthony is a Nazi.  No, I'm a fan 
[00:44:00]  of the World War II era.  I like World War II collectibles.  From all sides.  You know,  the Allies,  the Axis,  both sides.  I'm just a fan  of the whole era.  So I collect,  I'm fascinated  with the history  of World War II.  What should I be a fan of?  There was two nuclear detonations  and a Holocaust.  There are not two.  That's not all.  How are you a fan of that?  My favorite part  was the nuclear.  You should be an observer.  Right.  You're like,  I'm a fan of the era. 
[00:44:30]  It was a very interesting  time in history.  That's, you know,  with things like that,  of course.  Tragic events.  Very fascinating.  Yeah,  why don't you tell everyone  what you did  with your green screen  last night?  Well,  I was just checking out  some of my new software.  I enjoy  digital video photography.  Yeah.  And I have a little  green screen set up  because we're going to do  some kind of bit eventually  where we green screen  a couple of us.  You know,  rip off Stephen Colbert  from the Colbert Report. 
[00:45:00]  I understand it's a complete  and utter rip off  of what he did.  But we're going to try that.  So I was just testing out  a few things.  So I was taking myself,  green screening myself,  and then superimposing myself  on various films.  Not various.  One film.  I didn't see a film of you  with Babe Ruth.  Well,  I'm working on it.  I saw you  with Adolf Hitler  on a balcony.  I was giving the thumbs up  as he was giving the salute.  He gave his Hitler salute  and I gave  a nice later  20th century 
[00:45:30]  thumbs up.  But, you know,  it's not the content.  It's the work behind it.  Getting the film grain right,  the color,  the hue,  the black and white texturing,  the film grain,  things like that.  Explain that to your neighbors.  Well, no,  it was all green screen testing.  That's why I'm running around  in a Nazi outfit  at 3 o'clock in the morning.  I didn't have a Nazi outfit on.  I was wearing regular clothes  from,  from,  whatever,  the 2000s.  Oh, yeah.  Something else to add,  Syracuse and West Palm Beach 
[00:46:00]  because they're still  learning about the show.  Yes.  Anthony lives in  a Jewish neighborhood.  Because they're  the most peaceful people.  The only non-Jew  in this whole neighborhood  is Anthony.  I love  living amongst the Jews.  And they have no idea  what his neighbor is doing.  He's green screening himself  with Adolf Hitler  in this fine Jewish neighborhood.  Did you say the Jews  are the most peaceful people?  Well,  Israel's a real relaxing resort  type of thing.  I meant  American Jews.  Just like Club Med.  I love living 
[00:46:30]  amongst the Jews.  I am the only one  in my neighborhood  with Christmas decorations up.  And believe me,  they're going to start  throwing rocks  through the window  if I don't take  those things down.  But, yeah,  they're very peaceful.  They keep their lawns  well manicured.  The streets are clean.  The streetlights all work.  There's a neighborhood  watch community.  You could drive down  the street  and not see one  not see  not see  one person  that looks different.  I like that  in a neighborhood. 
[00:47:00]  I get it.  The cop doesn't live  in your neighborhood.  I didn't say anything  about that.  I'm just saying  what I'm saying is  I can identify  and the neighbors  can identify  what we in this neighborhood  like to call  riffraff.  Which would be what?  How would you define it?  Anybody  who really doesn't look  like they belong  in the neighborhood.  Like?  What would qualify?  Yeah, like.  I can't really  think about it.  You know it  when you see it.  Let's just put it that way.  You're very good  at explaining yourself  on this show  but for some reason  you can't really explain it. 
[00:47:30]  No, this is a perfect explanation.  You ever been in a situation  where you look at something  and you can't really describe it  but you know it  when you see it?  That's what I'm saying.  Like?  Like somebody  that doesn't look like  all of my neighbors.  How are they dressed?  A guy who's  poor maybe?  Poor?  It could be.  Well, let's say  it is a very  well-to-do neighborhood  let's say.  So if somebody  walked around  and looked  like they were  poor  perhaps  you're right  maybe some  tattered clothing 
[00:48:00]  a hoodie  a tattered hoodie  walking down  what kind of hair  do they have?  I don't know  but you would  a lot of people  a lot of people  from Israel  have very curly hair  some people  in my neighborhood  straight hair  there's some Asians  that live in  the neighborhood  kind of try to keep  them closer  to the parkway  but they do live there  and they have  very straight hair  so hair  I don't think  really comes into play.  Jews  and you're Italian  and Asians  it sounds like 
[00:48:30]  a pretty well-versed  community  how do you  not know  how do you  see somebody  you think  is not belonging  there?  You just know  there's something  that tells you  I can't put my  finger on it  but as you drive  by  if you look  if somebody's  walking down  the street  and you give  them a good look  you'll know  that's all I can say  so basically  if they were  shirtless  you wouldn't know  no I'd probably  know  alright we gotta 
[00:49:00]  take a break  can we get some  audio of the  stupid subway  here  enough of this  kook  enough  kook?  he's a kook  for some reason  or another  you sound a little  taller  on radio  it's the  Opie and Anthony  show  call the  Opie and Anthony  show right now  866-313-free  Boney who's this? 
[00:49:30]  Hi  I'm Tony  what do you got  for the show?  nothing  so why'd you call?  the man on the radio  thought I could call  oh fantastic  hang on  if you have a point  that's relevant  to the topic at hand  call the Opie and  Anthony show  at 866-313-free  okay bye  this is the Opie and  Anthony show  virus is spreading  Opie and Anthony  hey you're checking 
[00:50:00]  out the Opie and  Anthony show  we say good morning  to Syracuse today  it's the ONA virus  spreading across  America  phone number  1-866-313-free  during the break  we learned that  that old  Jimmy Norton  swim walks  to keep its shape  what the hell  is swim walking?  it's when you walk  and your arms  make a swimming  motion  because it helps  me stay physically 
[00:50:30]  fit  and takes the  pounds off  I walk  it looks ridiculous  I swim walk  it's like  you take your  left arm  and it's kind of  like you make  like you're moon  walking away  like you know  like you do  the worm  with your arm  you do the  Watusi  in the swimming  pool  the Watusi  yeah it's almost  like well there  is a dance  called the swim  where they do  that  I just swim  walk because  it keeps me  physically fit 
[00:51:00]  and helps  melt the pounds  away  does it  we're teaching  Syracuse a lot  today  they've learned  so far that  I live like a  college kid still  even though I'm  like almost 30  now  Anthony hates  blacks  and Jimmy  swim walks  that's what  they've learned  so far  give the people  of Syracuse  a misconception  that's what they  have learned  so far from  this show  who was here  in this studio  yesterday  who was here  in this studio  yesterday  Patrice O'Neal 
[00:51:30]  Patrice O'Neal  a man of  color  and someone  I consider  a very dear  friend  you call him  token behind  his back  I do not  I've never  said that  in my life  I love  Patrice  he's a good  guy  funny  he's alright  alright  let's move  on to the  thanks  Anthony's not  alright  it's only  one  Anthony's not  a racist  but we do  keep track  of something  every morning  today  the Anthony  clock  20 minutes  by the way 
[00:52:00]  before you  say something  you might want  to keep track  of that  at home  or at least  on whack bag  that fine  fan website  the Anthony  clock today  20 minutes  our staff  has decided  well we started  with the EROC  clock  because EROC  even though we  begged him  we sat him  down  we told him  he needs to  be here on time  he continues  to be late  and good old  Sam who is  looking to  take over  for EROC  someday  keeps track  of when 
[00:52:30]  EROC  arrives  at work  Sam is  one of the  biggest scumbags  here by the way  he looks all  innocent  but no  he's a rat  well the EROC  clock is  six minutes  late today  and then  somebody in the  office decided  to start the  Anthony clock  and today  it was 20  minutes  if you're  keeping track  at home  20 minutes  so that means  at 520  before something  flies out of  my mouth  whether we're  watching the  news  or reading  through the 
[00:53:00]  newspapers  or looking  at a website  before something  flies out of  my mouth  20 minutes  went by  today  yesterday  what was it  yesterday  it was like  4 minutes  it was what  13  because I know  there was one  that was  2  like the other  day it was  something like  2 minutes  yeah I don't  remember exactly  what the  you said  something about  one of the  Spanish speaking  radio stations  yeah okay  that's right  that's right 
[00:53:30]  and it came out  very quickly  so they're  keeping tabs  on me  today it was  520  20 minutes  in  I have a  very colorful  vocabulary  that's all  that's all  they can't  tap into your  thoughts  today 4 seconds  oh boy  3 seconds  colorful vocabulary  not a colorful  neighborhood  alright  let's move  on here  it's a very  colorful neighborhood  white and eggshell  of the people  why don't we  talk about this  dumb subway  hero again  he was on CNN 
[00:54:00]  he's going to be  on Letterman  tonight  he's making  the circuit  and now  one news  organization  out there  will tell you  that this guy  is just a kook  he's not a hero  technically he's a  hero yes  but he's a kook  first  he did something  that most people  wouldn't do  supposedly  saved a man's  life  the guy had a  seizure  on the subway  platform  he fell  onto the subway  tracks  very harrowing  how does that  happen  apparently he fell  and rolled  and rolled right  into the middle 
[00:54:30]  of the tracks  and you're  rolling the wrong  way  you don't roll  toward the exit  he rolled  toward the tracks  fell down  onto the tracks  now play along  at home people  guy has a  seizure  subway platform  rolls onto the  tracks  subway is now  coming  maybe you got  15 to 20 seconds  to do something  with this guy  what are you  going to do  the second  he had a seizure  I would point  at him and yell  witch  witch  witch  witch  have him burned 
[00:55:00]  but this guy  decided to help  him out  Patrice had a  great angle  yesterday  he goes at  that point  I would just  kind of look  around for the  hero  yeah where is  he because it  ain't me  see which  direction the  hero is coming  from  which direction  is spider-man  coming from  I am so far  from the  hero  because I'm  always on the  lookout for  some kind of  scam  like I would  think this guy  has a seizure  falls down  that if I go up  to help him  I'm getting a 
[00:55:30]  punch in the  face and waking  up and it'll be  4th of July  that's what I'm  thinking  some kind of  scam going on  yeah  but no the guy  actually needed  help  and so this guy  who's a kook  you know he  really is  well not the guy  that fell  the rest of  the news  could treat  him like a  hero but  he's a kook  he decides  he's gonna  jump onto  the tracks  doesn't have  time to  save the  guy and get  him back  up on the  platform  so he's  gonna lay  on top  of him  and he's  just gonna  assume at  this point  that there's  gonna be 
[00:56:00]  enough  clearance  when the  subway  rolls over  him  yep  that's it  he laid  on top  of him  we learned  today that  it was a  21 inch  space  he got  21 inches  of clearance  for two  people  he laid  on top  of the  guy  and let  the subway  cars run  him over  both of  them  and then  got a  scratch  and then  got up  not a  scratch  between  them  and now  he is  a media  darling  as they  call it  this guy  has perfect  timing  too  perfect timing  all the  other stories  the James  Brown  the Saddam 
[00:56:30]  the Gerald  Ford  stories  everyone's  tired of  him  it's old  news  now  no real  big new  story  so this  guy's it  he'll be  killed someday  trying to  recapture this  glory  when this  goes away  and it  will  he'll start  standing on  the subway  and no one  recognizes him  anymore  he will do  something  push people  and jump  on top  of them  or rescue  you in an  unrescuable  situation  he'll do  something  that you're  unrescuable  in and he'll  die  and it's  gonna be  you guys  might remember 
[00:57:00]  back in  2006  a guy  7  or 2007  whatever  it's still  early  it's not like  he wrote it  on a check  all the time  I've done  that too  I'm still  right in  2001  get out  of here  you  Jimmy's  right though  he's got  a good  angle  on this  eventually  yeah  he's gonna  have to  do  something  because he  really  is enjoying  this attention  they're calling  him like  the subway  superman  you can't  are they  yeah  you can't 
[00:57:30]  be the subway  superman  and then  just fade  into obscurity  again  superman  would have  picked him  up and flown  off  not laid  on top  of him  in the  muck  lay on  top  of him  yeah  maybe  he's  actually  subway  Christopher  Reeve  after the  old  horse  throw  just  laid  there  like  a  lump  yeah  well  they're calling  him  superman  I'm trying  to find  the picture  really fast  oh there  you go  yeah look  at what  they did  there  they super  a little  photoshop  in the  new york  post  now if that  superman  was walking  down my 
[00:58:00]  street  but the  subway  superman  name  very hard  to shake  off  and yeah  there's going  to be a  time where  people don't  recognize  right now  he's all  over the  news  he's probably  walking down  the street  and they're  like hey  hey  you're  and then  it's going  to get to  a point  where he's  not recognized  so he's  going to  have hats  made up  and maybe  a shirt  maybe just  the superman  logo  and he'll  be like  subway  superman  oh yeah  yeah  you're the  guy 
[00:58:30]  and then  no one  will just  care  eventually  a full  out superman  outfit  or whatever  well he's  going that  way because  like you  pointed out  no one's  really calling  this guy  a kook  he is a  kook  how about  bernie getz  versus him  subway gunman  versus the  subway superman  what a movie  those bullets  really don't  bounce off  do they  oops  you look like  you could use  another  guess you're  not really  superman now  are you  so now  he's on  CNN  and in the  office before  the show  we saw  footage of 
[00:59:00]  the guy  kissing  a relative  I guess  the father  was giving  a little  speech  out in front  of the  hospital  and talking  about how  thankful he  was that  the subway  superman  rescued his  son  and he  got a  little  choked  up  he got  a little  choked  up  it was  like  it was  you know  I want  to thank  this guy  man  if it  wasn't  you know  one of  those  things  and subway  superman  is standing  next to him  all you  know  proud  and when  the father  of the 
[00:59:30]  son  the father  of the  kid  that he  saved  started  crying  subway  superman  leaned  over  and kissed  his ear  he kissed  his ear  leaving his  mark on the  whole family  yeah  look I'm  happy but  I'm not  that happy  and then I  heard  driving in  on the  news that  they were  talking with  subway  superman  and subway  superman  says they're  making plans  they had met  in the  hospital  with the  father  and the  son  and they're  talking  and they're  making plans  now to get 
[01:00:00]  both of the  families together  for a big  you know  celebration  where they  can all  hang out  at you know  one of their  houses and  have a party  the white  house  why do they  need to do  that  why would  why would  they go to  washington  dc  jimmy  i know  that's not  what you meant  and let  why  why don't  they just  give the  guys some  money  i mean  i actually  like it  i believe  they are  they're coming  out of the  woodwork  a couple of  people are  coming forward  i think  he goes to  film school 
[01:00:30]  right  the kid  that rolled  onto the  tracks  accidentally  that had  the seizure  and subway  superman has  two kids  and the school  that the  the victim  went to  is giving  some kind  of scholarship  to subway  superman's  children  and he got  like five  thousand dollar  reward from  somewhere  might have been  the school  what a waste  of money  that  five g's  travis earned  five g's  badly picking  football  teams  so watch  this kid  be like  ed wood  too  he probably  saved like  the world's  worst director  meanwhile  scorsese's  you know  young predecessor 
[01:01:00]  was piped  over the  head on  145th street  a crazy  gentleman might  jump on me  to save my  life on the  train tracks  i like to  wear women's  clothing  anthony and  i are hoping  that he has  a 1982  rape  conviction  i'm hoping  that just  because he's  on the news  so much  someone goes  recognizing  goes  that's the  man that  raped me  they do  a little  history  and go  he has  a 1982  rape  conviction  because there's  nothing better  than a hero  that gets  on the news  and gets  his face  on there  just so  the cops  can go  wait a minute  isn't this 
[01:01:30]  the idiot  we've been  looking for  yeah well  he did the  same thing  to me  on the  tracks  but while  he was  raping  he threw  me down  and just  attacked  me  i tried  to get up  but he  wouldn't  let me  same move  only naked  that's his  mo  we just  tell people  there's  train  coming  so they  don't  move  maybe  he's gonna  wake up  and go  i'm so  glad  he saved  my life  and my  wallet  must have  fallen out  on the  fall  because it  was gone  when i woke  up in the  hospital  inbred  pest from  amish  country  look it's  a bird 
[01:02:00]  no it's  a plane  no it's  late for  work  i just  read him  i have not  heard this  guy interviewed  at all  i have not  heard him  but what  they got  for the  guy today  they have  a whole  agenda  here in  the  paper  mayor  bloomberg  today  will honor  the 50  year old  grandfather  at city  hall  he's got  like a  whole day  planned  like he's  a dignitary  yeah  this is  amazing  then he  goes off  and sees  donald trump 
[01:02:30]  he's gonna  see the  donald  now one  of these  people are  gonna call  him out  and say  you're a  kook  donald trump  will reward  the construction  worker with a  check for  ten thousand  dollars  ten g's  ten g's  then he goes  off to david  letterman  does letterman  does something  for letterman  twelve years  on doing  grinding out  a radio  show for  us to  do  letterman  opie  twelve years  twelve years  and this guy  jumps on  somebody on  a train  track  that's right  scholarships 
[01:03:00]  for his  two kids  other offers  included college  tuition for the  kids who were on  the subway  platform  tuesday  yeah he did  this in front  of his kids  by the way  yeah horrifying  his children  horrifying his  children  all they saw  was their  father jump  on the train  tracks and a  train run  him over  and it  shouldn't be  too much  damage as  they get  older  and it  looks like  they're going  to disney  as well  oh not  bad  that's nice  that's good  try it on  the monorail  idiot  see how that  works out for  you  here we go  well the latest 
[01:03:30]  stop for the  subway  superman  is cnn  i don't want to  see nobody hurt  so i felt  you know the  best thing to do  was start the  new york right  what a better  way than to  save a life  wesley noticed  cameron hollow  peter having a  seizure  hollow peter  yes  excuse me  we forgot  the young  victim's name  is hollow  peter  see that guy  didn't have a  seizure he  couldn't live  with his name  anymore  i'd throw  myself in  front of a  train too  oh my god 
[01:04:00]  i'm  the  the taunting  in high school  when your name  is hollow  peter  exactly i'm  tired of being  being being  teased by  carl fullbag  what an awful  name  hollow peter  indeed  i think he  meant to lean  on this but  when he came  this way he  went like this  bumped off  and fell  backwards  what wesley  did next sent  his girls age  six and four  into tears 
[01:04:30]  he handed  them to a  woman and  jumped onto  the track to  save a man  he'd never  met  i hopped  down here  one feet  there  one feet  there  i look  i see  an oncoming  can you pause  that for one  second  and maybe you  want to rewind  that uh  um  i i i don't  know he's an  arachnid he put  one feet there  and one feet  there i'll  accept it once  but not twice  he's an arachnid  there was one  one foot one 
[01:05:00]  feet here and  one feet there  did he really  say that i  didn't even  notice  yeah let's  hear that again  here one feet  there one  feet there  i look  i see an  oncoming  train  one feet  went uh  on one side  i guess  and the other  feet went on  the other  side  and he used  the other  feet to  brace himself  to the back  while holding  down the guy  with his two  other feet  his large  powerful  mandibles  uh ready to  stop the  train  why are we  calling him  the subway  spider-man 
[01:05:30]  he should be  spider-man  i hopped  down here  one feet  there  one feet  there  i look  i heard  that  yeah  oh brother  never met  i hopped  down here  one feet  there  one feet  there  i look  i see  an oncoming  train  see what i  read in  blue light  yeah  but  the farthest  one  that's where  the train  was when  i first  went down  so he saw 
[01:06:00]  that uh  light bearing  down on him  yeah  and he jumped  uh  onto the tracks  he describes  being on the  tracks  i'm flipping  each time i go  i look the train  getting closer  train getting  closer  getting closer  so the last  time i  the train  was about  right there  where that  where that  wood is  and i'm like  you can't  get him up  go for the  gutter  so i just  grabbed him  like this  felt on top  of him  locked my legs  around his  felt on top  of him  can you rewind  that a little  i grabbed  i felt on top  of him  did he 
[01:06:30]  he felt  on top  of him  yes  wait did he  does that mean  he copped a feel  or that he's  a lounge singer  jacket  i believe  yes he threw  some uh  pool table  covering over  him  i felt  on top  of him  i just felt  on top  of him  locked my legs  around his  both of them  held them  down  put my head  over here  and leave  in the gutter  so he was  on his back  and you were  on top  of him  oh  when the time  Wesley jumped  down on the  tracks  he thinks  he had  only about  seven seconds  before the  train 
[01:07:00]  was on top  of him  face to face  yeah  obviously the guy  had nothing to lose  hopefully the  seizure man  was a size  queen  wow  he thanked me  and he said  he didn't even  realize that he  was underneath  the train  but  Wesley doesn't  like being  called a hero  but to Cameron's  family  that's what he is  mr.  autry's instinctive  and unselfish 
[01:07:30]  jack saved  saved our  son's  life  there are no  words to properly  express our  gratitude and  feelings for his  actions  uh  yes there is  i like this  guy  you do  i like him  he's got spunk  like the subway  superman  of course i do  he's a very brave  guy  he's a nice guy 
[01:08:00]  he's a kook  i do like him  hero or not  wesley's in demand  david letterman  wants to interview him  donald trump  is giving him  ten grand  his kids have  been offered a  trip to disneyland  and the new york  film academy  which cameron  attends  surprised wesley  with a five  thousand dollar  check plus  five thousand  dollars in  scholarships for  his children  wesley says he  doesn't care about  the money  he just wants  others to know  life is worth  saving  oh god  and they also 
[01:08:30]  forgot to mention  he got another  prize actually  he actually did  get another thing  we got some  tickets to my  show in chicago  coming up  at zany's  i am uh  oh that's right  i'm going to  provide him  with no airfare  um  and he can grab  the bottom of a  train and ride  out there  tickets to my  show at zany's  he doesn't need  airfare  he's superman  that's true  he flies  and wait till you  see all the  different shows  he gets tickets  to  you'll hear about  all of them  that's right  shameless 
[01:09:00]  why  i'm making him  one of my  top eight friends  on myspace.com  slash jim norton  the subway  superman  how come  that's a gift  other people  are allowed  to give him  stuff  and you know  you're giving  him tickets  to your show  but that's  not going  to make  the news  maybe because  that's like  a gift  that nobody  will believe  is actually  happening  oh okay  it couldn't  be true  no one  could be  this generous  we're trying  to get him  on the phone  by the way  subway superman  oh yeah  more from  the subway  hero  subway hero 
[01:09:30]  talks about  kissing  victim's dad  oh  he talks about  that  we saw this  he was very  happy  he shook  my hand  his father  had tears  in his eyes  he grabbed me  we hugged  I kissed him  outside  because it was a  very touching  touching moment  that's something  that you don't see  not many people  would probably  even risk their  life to do  what I've done  today  oh wow  see he's not  very humble  oh boy  when does the  family have enough  of the subway  superman  you owe me 
[01:10:00]  and finally have  to go  look dude  come on  I know you did  a good thing  here but  time to move  on  enough  just knocking  on the door  all the time  when do the  father and son  have their  moment of eye  contact  when they  realize this  gentleman  laid belly  to belly  with the son  and kissed  the father  on the ear  when does  the mother  walk in  and look  at those  two faggots  that she lives  with  yeah this  guy  the guy 
[01:10:30]  he was  kind of  alright  right up  until he  said that  last thing  that's not  very humble  not many  people would  do what  I did  it's okay  if somebody  says not  many people  would do  what you  did  but when  you're  saying it  yourself  eek  this guy  is going  to be  the media  attention  is getting  to him  already  yeah  and he's  going to  be a thorn  in the side  of this  family  for a while  to come  here inside  Autry's  family's  apartment  I spoke  to his  mother  she says  she wasn't  surprised 
[01:11:00]  in the least  to hear  what her son  had done  I just said  thank god  that y'all  was alive  and the lord  had you  in the right  place  at the right  time  to help  other people  I said  keep doing  what you're  doing  I said  you can't  lose  gotta be  with you  oh boy  old black  women are  always so  religious  thank god  the lord  if the lord  was there  he wouldn't  have rolled  the shaken  little gentleman  into the train  onto the train

[01:12:00]  even more  than that  why did  the lord  take his  foot with  a hole  in it  and boot  that guy  out of the  tracks to  begin with  yeah  maybe he  was tired  of him  could have  been  maybe the lord  wanted  that guy  maybe it  was his  time  yeah  it was  part of  the big  planet  yeah  alright  well  there you  go  that's the  latest on  subway  superman  go away  oh I don't  know I  kind of like  him  no you  don't  I do  I think  I know  you don't

[01:18:00]  probably when  the dinosaurs  were roaming  this planet  this thing  was in space  just going  just spinning  slowly  being affected  by various  heavenly bodies  gravitational  poles  and it  and it knew  in its little  meteorite brain  yeah  there it is  in the year  007  not even yet  not even yet  then there's 
[01:18:30]  just this  primordial  ooze  this  just  and a creature  steps out  of the ooze  of this planet  that will someday  carry  human beings  it's still  just  spinning  and moving  oh what happened  cavemen  they've learned  to make fire  civilizations  perk up  christopher columbus  discovers america  we slaughter

[01:32:00]  sugar is sugar  anything you can't  have in a regular cup  you can't have in a  sippy cup  what's the difference  vodka  yeah exactly  well the sippy cup  is just  yeah it's just  so that it doesn't  spill  it's not that  the sippy cup  has anything to do  with it  so the news was  basically sugar  causes cavities  yeah  wow  yeah it doesn't  matter what it's in  right  they disguised it  like your kid  might be in  danger  some major danger  here so we'll tell  you what not to  cavities  their sippy cup  there you go  it's uh

[01:34:30]  this just in  listen to this  you know  at the end of the year  the number one story  here at  Good Day New York  as indicated by the viewers  on our website  the Steve Irwin story  the crocodile hunter  when he was killed  well  as we all know  he was videotaping  his show  when he was killed  and now that videotape  boy you would think  it'd be on YouTube  or something by now  well the family  got a hold of the tape  and they destroyed it  so I guess that's not why 
[01:35:00]  nobody has seen it  I think what a great idea  you gotta get that tape  and destroy it  because it will get on  everything that is  odd  or oddly said  ends up on the internet  these days  that's it huh  that's it  why is that a good thing  what  what  a stupid family  that's the most interesting  thing he ever did  was get killed  by that faggotty  little floating stingray  and you destroy it  yeah  how irritating  if my dad  if you're listening  if you're killed 
[01:35:30]  by a stingray  I'm gonna play it  at your wake  and laugh at you  oh my god  how do you not  show that to people  not only are you gonna show it  you're gonna show it  on the big screen  in Times Square  next New Year's Eve  it's gotta be  the greatest thing ever  it's uh  like you said  more interesting  than him  chasing around  a bug  in the desert  or a snake  ooh  you gotta think  that Steve Irwin himself  they always  well what would Steve want  you gotta think 
[01:36:00]  the guy would have  wanted that to be shown  really  oh yeah  show me getting  stabbed  and dying  and who's the one  that turned it over  to the family  had to get a hold  of it and destroy it  yeah  I guess it was  you think they ran  off a copy  they had to  of course  they always wonder  there's still a copy  out there somewhere  they ran off a copy  that it's like  the stupid bear guy  the guy that was  killed by the bear  was there a copy  of that audio  or was that destroyed  uh supposedly  that was destroyed  as well 
[01:36:30]  yeah well  Grizzly Man  Grizzly Man  yeah  we don't want any  audio of him  being killed  no  being eaten alive  in a frying pan  being banged  over the bear's head  I bought that myth  I thought I was  gonna hear or see  cause it was a video  camera  that was rolling  I thought I was  gonna see  or hear some  of the audio  of this guy  getting eaten  alive by the bears  you get nothing  you get nothing  it's a huge build up  and then  then one of the  the  one of his friends  gets to listen  to the audio  with headphones on  and you're just 
[01:37:00]  watching their reaction  as they listen  to the audio  and then the guy  goes  if I was you  I would take  this tape  and destroy it  here you go  and hands it  over to this woman  I'm like  are you kidding me  yeah why  why is you  how about we take  9-11 footage  and destroy it  or the Kennedy  Assassin  this is a Pruder  film  I mean  look it's  archived thing  footage  the guy was  a public figure  and so was  Steve Irvin  why should they  be destroyed  it's irritating  I guess because  it was you know  their personal  property  it was his show  I don't even know 
[01:37:30]  you know  maybe years ago  I might have cared  I'm at the point  now  you could pop up  so many  snuff films  on the internet  it doesn't even  matter anymore  you want to see  a guy  it's interesting  I mean  I've never seen  video of a guy  getting killed  by a stingray  it might be  interesting to watch  but I've seen  8,000 other ways  people have died  and it's all been  captured on the  magic of videotape  and put on the internet  so screw it  even Saddam Hussein's 
[01:38:00]  execution was  caught by Michael J. Fox  God almighty  what a not good job  that was  I was saying  you know  he's going to be  standing on that  platform  and if  the savage  holding that phone  knew anything  about gravity  he'd know  you just have to  move the thing  down  just  there he is  he'll be dropping  downward when that  hatch opens up  this guy's swinging  sideways  he got arrested  almost like he was  thinking  where'd he go  where's he going  is he going to  run off to the left  no he's dropping 
[01:38:30]  down about a meter  he's only going  one direction  dummy  there was your  big opportunity  and you blew it  he got arrested  it should be for  horrid photography  did he really  get arrested  yep  they arrested  that guy  that had the camera  not supposed to  have cameras in there  and it's Iraq  so they'll be  hanging him soon  here's  yeah  somebody with a  video phone  there's  that video  and then there's  the state video  the video that  they made  with no sound  so you didn't  get to see  a very defiant  kind of brave 
[01:39:00]  Saddam  facing death  like a man  you know  and kind of  adding to his  mystique and  legend  they didn't  want that  you got that  on that phone  so the government  that's in place  over there  whatever it is  is pretty pissed  off about that  and the other  thing  I read  there was a  statement out of  the White House  that the president  has not and will  not watch  the execution  and I looked at  that and said  you know something  I understand  the bull crap 
[01:39:30]  that comes out  of the White House  but could you  stop  what idiot  is sitting there  reading that  official statement  that the president  has not and will not  and they asked  what they asked him  because it wasn't him  they were asking  his press secretary  why hasn't he seen it  and he goes  that is what the  president's focusing on  that's the past  he's focusing on  the future of Iraq  and I'm sitting there  thinking  you know something  just as  the president  of the United States  you would want to  watch that to see 
[01:40:00]  first of all  for information  on who did this  how are they doing it  is it being handled  properly  how are the executioners  carrying out  the execution  what would the  building look like  just any information  intelligence  you would want  it's what you wanted  with the invasion  anyway  you wanted to get him  you got him  and you're not going to  walk he's lying  and it's a blatant  just lie  again  coming out of the  White House  surprising  you got to think  he was one of the  first people to see it 
[01:40:30]  of course  not only did he see it  he was probably  the first person  to see it  he absolutely saw it  that is just  that is a lie  Mr. President  video has just been released  there was somebody  on the phone  it's all over the  internet right now  if you want us  to pull you a copy  no no  I don't  I am concentrating  on the future  of Iraq  stop with your  bull crap  statements  the guy  absolutely watched  and he saw  the state version  he saw the  crystal clear version 
[01:41:00]  he saw the  crystal clear version  with the audio  absolutely  no doubt  my mind  yeah  he didn't have to  watch the cell phone  audio  right  stop with the  lies  there's a 3D  IMAX version  that he saw  when you're laying  under Saddam  and his little feet  right over your head  he puts the funny  3D glasses on  and reaches out  and touches them  tries to touch  his little feet  it's like it's  right in front of me  it's amazing  it's like Captain EO  hey we were just  talking about the  positive cabbie  mentioned a ride  from 30 years ago  yeah well  just to change gears 
[01:41:30]  we were talking about  the positive cabbie  we got audio  it's a quickie  but this is the guy  that picked up Jimmy  one morning  with the chauffeur's cap  and the patriotic tie  he's an ass  jackass  he hands you  a little positive  thought cards  or poems  or what are they  just drivel  just drivel  stuff about being nice  being nice  yeah  being nice  hey you know  there are more than  40,000 cab drivers  in New York City  so yeah  when do you actually  remember one

[01:43:30]  of Paul  because he even  gives thank you notes  to every person  that gets in his cab  what's with the note  that's something I like  to do  I learned it  from a fellow  called Tom Hopkins  and he told us  to give a thank you  a thank you card out  so I just  incorporated into my business  well I love that you do that  I've got to get  to Commissioner Dodd  so he can tell us  how outstanding you are  how rare is Paul  as a driver  I mean we know already  but how outstanding  is he for a team  well there's only one  Paul Hintersteiner  but in terms of 
[01:44:00]  his professionalism  his courtesy  his customer service  there are many drivers  like that  in their own unique way  they all bring something  to the job  look at that  last year  we gave him the award  as the most professional  driver in the city  of New York  and you guys  he truly is  thank you so much  for joining us  Commissioner  they had it  he couldn't make him  really single them out  as being special  but you know  they're all really good  in their own way  while they're not  planning on blowing  up other buildings  Haitian that cuts  across six lanes  of traffic  just like the courteous  cabbie  yeah  you want to go 
[01:44:30]  downtown  I don't know  what you're saying  jams on the brakes  in front of you  just stops  to let people out  and clogs up  an entire thoroughfare  instead of pulling over  when they could pull over  just animals  remember the day  at XM  where we saw  the two cabbies  just toe to toe  beating the crap  out of each other  those two  are those the two  you're talking about  also  we have a lot  of wonderful people  god was that great  they're ready to  kill each other  really fast  going back to the 
[01:45:00]  Saddam video  John and Jersey  go ahead John  yeah I just  you know  didn't Saddam  try to kill his old man  I mean I have  that thing gift wrecked  don't you point  that gun at my dad  I don't feel  the impression  as good as Jay does  that was good  and the guy's gone  yeah  Saddam did try  to kill Bush's father  of course he's  looking at the video  our buddy Bartlett  Rob Bartlett  just mentioned  the baby bird video  while talking about  the Saddam video  on Iman  how do you compare 
[01:45:30]  the two  the baby bird video  is just taking over  the internet  that's disgusting  it's  if you add them all up  it's well over  like 2 million views  of course  do we have to explain  this for Syracuse  watch  here it is  we had an eggnog  drinking contest  Pat from Wynaki  one of the  fine friends  of our show  big fat  big fat kid  with nine toes  because he's got diabetes  drank  75 double shots  of eggnog  and vomited  but before he vomited 
[01:46:00]  one of our  intern prospects  who really wanted  to be an intern  for the show  was given a suggestion  by Joe Rogan  from Fear Factor  to lean his head  over a garbage pail  like you were getting  your hair shampooed  and take the  baby bird  you know how a mother  feeds a baby bird  regurgitation  Pat from Wynaki  full of 75 or so  double shots  of eggnog  puked  in this young boy's  face  and mouth  yeah  the video  is great  all you have to do  is throw baby bird 
[01:46:30]  in the search engine  of break.com  B-R-E-A-K  dot com  and you can see  the video  it's getting viewed  like  like  like  like hotcakes  getting viewed  like  do you just  look at hotcakes  sometimes you do  because of all the  carbohydrates  that's a good way  to say it  just look  right to my hips  they should say  it's getting viewed  like a trend  he's in the meat  packing district  because a lot of  times you're right  around just look  you don't want to  buy because  that'd be gay  give me those ribs  ow  well Rob Bartlett  gave us a nice  mention on Imus 
[01:47:00]  a few moments ago  there's no justice  in life  just ask  Saddam Hussein  he's the number  one viewed video  on YouTube  even beats  Opie and Anthony's  baby bird  and the poor bastard  don't even get  to see it himself  it's good  no the Imus crew  has seen the  baby bird video  the baby bird video  there you see  the baby  the puke  yeah  that's pretty cool  right  yeah  thank you  thank you  the Saddam one's  the most viewed  though right  of course  yeah of course 
[01:47:30]  what is number two  that would be the  the question  I want answered  today  how  it's probably  that stupid girl  it's probably  stupid dance  revolution  ass guy  who's too fat  now to do it  I saw him on  is he a husband  oh my god  you've seen  dance revolution  right  it's like a  three  video or something  it's all  all different  dances from  from across  the ages  and it's like  one of the  biggest YouTube  videos of all  time  well now he's  finally getting  attention  I guess the  video's pretty  old  it's pretty  old 
[01:48:00]  because he's  fat now  he's fat  oh that's funny  because I think  he was on  Ellen  one of these  shows  of course  the dance  thing  it all  makes sense  and he came  out  and they  had him  doing it  but he does  a very short  version  and he's  out of breath  puffing and puffing  he's not in shape  anymore  I've never seen  that video  it's  don't bother  it's typical  YouTube crap  some dancing  I know there's  that girl  that just kind  of looks  into the camera  and talks  and babbles  what is she 
[01:48:30]  lonely girl  lonely girl  yeah  lonely girl  15  yeah  her  she's like  most viewed  a lot of the  times  why does anyone  care what she  says  who cares  who cares  what she's got  to say  take your clothes  off or shut  up  that's what I  say about  lonely girl  I've seen a horse  gag  she'll be number  one on YouTube  yeah where's  a horse gag  how about that  gentleman who  the horse taught  a real lesson  to  right  in the Pacific  Northwest  or the German  and the chicken  where's that  video on YouTube  that would be  most viewed 
[01:49:00]  screw the Saddam  thing  how can  how come  they won't put  that on YouTube  they deem it  offensive  that's why  YouTube  but they will  show a snuff  film  we've had our  Saddam is being  killed on that  he's actually  you're watching a  human being put  to death  and a celebrity  really you're  watching a celebrity  being killed  but they won't put  something like the  German chicken video  which is just an  innocent video  of a German  gentleman  having a fun  time with a  chicken 
[01:49:30]  that's right  a chicken that  was asking for it  if I may  right  was a cute  chicken  by the way  today's  yeah that's  good chicken  by the way  today's most  viewed video  and this guy's  been on hold  for an hour  to ask this  question right  here  it's Jim in  Philly  listening to us  on WYSP  Jim what's up  hey you want  some good audio  type in  Tara Reid  countdown to  2007  oh yeah  seen it  on YouTube  it's a classic  I heard that  was edited though

[01:53:00]  for Rosie O'Donnell  in this  ET Insider  exclusive interview  today  she can't stand  Rosie  I mean you know  maybe Barbara  will never speak  to me again  she didn't tell me  to keep it quiet  or I would never  reveal that  on the view today  that's exactly  what Barbara did  Donald Trump  also said  that I am not  happy with my  decision to bring  Rosie O'Donnell  to this table  nothing could be  further from the truth  during my conversation  with Barbara  she called me last week  she said  Donald 
[01:53:30]  I gotta put up  with it  I can't stand it  I hate it  now eventually  she'll get rid of  Rose  there's no question  in my mind  I have never  regretted  nor do I  now  the hiring  of Rosie O'Donnell  oh shut up  Barbara's a lying  old bitch  she was gonna  lie about  the Star Jones  situation  Trump's a dick  for revealing  that because  it was private  but you know  I think he's  honest  I think he's  lying  yeah taking  taking both  based on past  record  I would say  that Barbara  in my opinion  is the liar 
[01:54:00]  in this one  because yeah  she lied  about the  Star Jones  thing  and Donald  what has he  got to lose  and again  he's a real  estate person  we're actually  picking someone  who's a bigger  liar than a real  estate person  he's made a living  lying to people  it's fine property  it's fine property  it's a wonderful  place  it's on a cemetery  you're gonna be  very happy  you're at Indian  burial ground  your children  fall into the  television set  he sold the  poltergeist  I love both  of these people  I love the  Donald 
[01:54:30]  and Rosie's  alright too  in my book  Donald I think  is winning  in this one  though  he's kind of  making Rosie  look silly  because he's  attacking the  way you should  attack  like you don't  have to  well you know  he just went  for the throat  that's the way  you attack  that's how you  attack  yeah most people  would have said  stuff like  you know  Rosie O'Donnell  has said some  things that I  didn't agree with  and think  it's all gotta  be very  politically correct  he's like  talking about  you better watch  I'm gonna steal  you get somebody  to steal your  girlfriend away  from you  she's a fat  slob 
[01:55:00]  she's a degenerate  she's not funny  she had no ratings  she's a failure  just he's pounding her  can't say her show  is a failure  you can't say her  date  you definitely can  because he is  saying that  it doesn't matter  if it is or was  or isn't  he is saying it  so people will  believe it  some people will  believe it  then again she  said he was  broke  he's bankrupt  nice to have  billions of  dollars and be  bankrupt  it was just  before Christmas  when Donald  threatened to  sue Rosie 
[01:55:30]  and possibly  The View  over remarks  she had made  that he went  bankrupt  now I guess  she was referring  to many years  ago but I  never went  bankrupt  many of my  friends went  bankrupt  I never went  bankrupt  but she said  I went  bankrupt  then she said  I went  bankrupt  a number of  times  I never  went  bankrupt  and today  Barbara was  asked by  ABC to read  a statement  clarifying  the bankruptcy  issue  and I will  quote  Donald Trump  has never  filed for  personal  bankruptcy  several of  his casino  companies have  filed for  business  bankruptcies 
[01:56:00]  they are out  of bankruptcy  now  are you still  in the sewer  what my lawyers  really want  wow  so Barbara  had to get  on and make  a statement  yeah  because of  what Rosie  said  because they  were false  statements  that Rosie  made  you know  damn well  she didn't  want to do  that  yeah but you  know what  Rosie likes to  say that  everyone knew  she was talking  about the  casinos or  whatever  and his name  is on the  casino  and it's like  man come on  he doesn't want  it clarified  when they're talking  about the casino  like when they go  Trump great casino  that's not 
[01:56:30]  that's not me  but yeah if  they if they  say something  about bankruptcy  then it's a  separate  he's sick  he's sick  the lawyers  after them  yeah  and she had  to get on  and make a  statement  or else  he would have  been able to  sue  yeah  wow  let's say  hi to Tom  in New York  City  Tom what's up  what's up  boys  hey  oh when did  you become  such a big  Rosie O'Donnell  endorser man  well it's not  that I'm an  endorser  I like the fact  that she's  speaking her  mind on the  view  I didn't  respect her  for hiding  that she was  a lesbian  until that  show of hers 
[01:57:00]  went off the  air  I'll tell you  how I like her  I used to  never like her  either  but the fact  she was talking  about Michael  Jackson one  time  she goes  I didn't  say hi to him  I don't say  hi to pedophiles  she said that  about Michael  Jackson  that's a rough  line  she said a lot  of brutal  things since  she left  her show  so I kind  of like  her  she's  friends with  Paula Poundstone  I'm sure  she is  I like that  she speaks  her mind  on the  view  I mean  most of  these people  on TV  they're  so safe  with everything  they do  and say  you know  Rosie's  just out 
[01:57:30]  of her  mind  basically  every day  on the  view  Barbara  Walters  I have  a detesting  loathing  for  I really  hate her  guts  old liar  I think  Barbara's  lying  and I don't  think Rosie's  really sticking  up for herself  on the  view  I think  Barbara  Walters  is telling  her to  shut up  because she's  not going  after Donald  like I  would respect  her more  if she  really  started  getting  brutal  with him  back  but no  she's  just kind  of sitting  there  taking it  how did  you feel  when she  called you  a pimp  well I  think it's 
[01:58:00]  just so  inappropriate  and she  called me  a pimp  because they  own beauty  pageants  and they're  very successful  she also  said oh the  big pageant  is Miss  America  not Miss  USA  well first  of all the  really big  pageant  is Miss  Universe  which I  own  but the  big pageant  is Miss  USA  not  I'm on  network  prime  it's a  hot show  it does  terrific  ratings  and she  gets out  and says oh  the big  one is Miss  America  it's not  Miss  USA  I mean  Rosie lies  but this  is not  a woman  who's smart  and why  aren't they 
[01:58:30]  playing any  of the brutal  audio  yeah where's  the brutal  where you  call it  fatty  ugly  I'm hoping  I got it  not you  but the  news  are they  showing that  it's here  right  yeah  because I  watched this  last night  I'm surprised  at how many  people  so many  people  hate  Rosie O'Donnell  they hate  her  Trump  holding  nothing  back  hey look  she did  a show  it failed  ultimately  it failed  it was  successful  for a little  while  then it  failed  because  people  got used  to her  and they  said oh  my god  this woman  is a  disaster  why is 
[01:59:00]  that dramatic  dramatic music  can you do  the girl's  voice from  E.T.  E.T.  Donald Trump  having a  problem  with  Rosie O'Donnell  we're going  to talk  about it  and listen  to some  of the  stuff  Donald said  about  Rosie  a hell  kind of  entertainment  reporter  talk  that's how  they all  talk 
[01:59:30]  tonight  exclusive  interview  with  Donald  Trump  about  the  Rosie  O'Donnell  situation  it's hot  and heavy  in Hollywood  as  Donald  jokes  it out  with  Rosie  we'll get  Barbara  Walters  exclusive  response  to the  young  thing  speak  like a  human  god  is that  great  finally  the last  clip 
[02:00:00]  of Trump  going off  on Rosie  she didn't  want to  give her  a second  chance  Rosie  who had  many  chances  and you  know  when you  look like  Rosie  you have  to have  a lot  of  chances  it's  not  easy  and  Donald  wasn't  done  he  continued  listing  what he  considers  Rosie's  defeats  they did  a magazine  called  Rosie  a total  and complete  failure  and then  somebody said  you never  mentioned the  Broadway play  she did a  Broadway play  it bombed so  badly on Broadway  she tried to  keep it alive  keep it alive  but it was a  disaster  in a certain way  she's a  degenerate  Rosie's a  loser  Rosie's really 
[02:00:30]  a loser  what about  the fat  it was  yeah  it was  there  it was  not in  these clips  obviously  but these  are the  latest clips  but those  are the  physical  things  where he  calls her  ugly  fat  pig  these are  the latest  clips  from yesterday  these are  brand new  Trump clips  I can't get  enough of this  stuff  it's great  what is she  saying about him  nothing  out of nowhere  she's on  vacation  I guess it was  planned for a long 
[02:01:00]  time is what  they're saying  what a bunch  of crap  that is too  she just  started  that's so  stupid  man  it's like  everyone wants  to see what  Rosie's gonna  do  they're gonna  tune in  the view  but as soon  as you tune  in the view  and you realize  she's not there  for the morning  you're off to  something else  do you honestly  think she just  started on the  goddamn show  that she's taking  a vacation  do you think  this is a  planned vacation  hey a couple  of months in  I need a  vacation  no they're  trying to 
[02:01:30]  sweep this  thing  of course  they are  and they  should milk  it  it's okay  I was just  making a fat  cow joke  it's still  better than  anything I  had to say  which is when  then she'll  come back  and she'll  talk about  her vacation  you were  coming up  with a  funny joke  and I  was stating  that she'll  talk about  her vacation  I should  have shut  my mouth  I'm a  fat pig  and you  can steal  my girlfriend  controversy  sells  and Barbara  Walters  wants it  just to go  away  she should  absolutely  just milk 
[02:02:00]  it  come on  and she  does  stink  Barbara  Walters  sucks  any time  she gets  so powerful  immediately  2020 I  think  all those  dumb  interviews  they did  an interview  special  her top  interviews  I watched  the whole  thing  I'm like  why  why  were her  interviews  so great  why is she  the biggest  interviewer  in the world  she got to  interview all  the presidents  Fidel Castro  and all the  big movie stars  and you watch  these things  there's nothing  special here  she can't even  speak  used to be  an event  the Barbara  Walters  interviews  and she'd 
[02:02:30]  get everyone  to cry  was the big  thing  and they  all try  to get  her  to do  something  and the  reality is  she can't  do anything  else  she can't  even play  tennis  or pool  or anything  because all  the Hollywood  actors would  try to get  her to do  something  they like  to do  and she'd  just look  join me  play a little  racquetball  or golf  something  yes  fan  or her  trying to  strip tease  with Demi Moore  oh yeah  when she was  doing that  movie  strip tease  I believe  it was called  yeah  they've shown 
[02:03:00]  that clip  where she's  trying to  work the  pole  do a little  pole dance  Barbara Walters  now  come on  without the  pole  Barbara is  really a  sexy woman  but on  that pole  she has  to be the  most unsexy  thing  ever  ever  ever  she's  atrocious  trannies  are more  sexy  goes without  saying  stating the  obvious  it might  be tough 
[02:03:30]  to get  but she  counted down  all these  special moments  from her  interviews  it would be  great audio  to play  on the show  because some  of the  stuff is  just  douche chills  for everyone  I don't even  remember  she's claiming  that Clint Eastwood  actually made a  pass at her  and she  feels regret  that she  never went  for it  it's like  are you  that delusional  bridges in  Madison County  moment was  that  he probably  waved it  at her  and she  almost  did it  as a goof  from the  bathroom  opened the 
[02:04:00]  door  and waved  at her  grabbed the  back of her  over hair  sprayed head  her and  Diane Sawyer  I'd like to  push them  both down  the elevator  shaft  don't mess  with Diane  she's hot  at 6  how do you  know  you can't  even see  her anymore  I don't  know what  they're  doing  to that  lens  what channel  is she  on  they're  shooting  through  her  comfort  7  AB  oh  ok  yeah  that  bitch  they're  filming  her  through  the  heart  lens  they  are  filming  her  through 
[02:04:30]  like  a  gunny sack  it used to be like  some kind of  weird filter  they'd put on  now they just go  to a potato  store  and get the  gunny sacks  and film it  through that  I love HD  yeah  they just did an article  yeah  that HD  is ruining  these  these  these  careers  it's  changing  the way  that  celebrities  want  themselves  filmed  they don't  it used to be  that they wanted  their close ups  you know  I'm ready for my  close up  Mr. DeMille  now they don't want 
[02:05:00]  close ups  they want to be  far away  they want  different lenses  if you notice  a lot of these  shows now  news shows  especially  the women  look different  they're being  filmed differently  than the men  they're being  lit differently  and filters  are being put on  when they have  their  close up  shot  they say  this is what I read  they're saying  the industry  insiders are saying  that men  come off  looking more  angular  and more  manly  and the women  just come off  looking awful  and old  well how about 
[02:05:30]  this you shallow  whore  read me the news  I don't care  if you look ugly  how come they're  doing reports  on how  you know  you'll see a report  about fat people  and why they  aren't given  why they aren't  given jobs  and stuff like that  yet one of the  most important  things they're  working on now  is how beautiful  they look on  television  they're hypocrites  why do they need  makeup even  you're reading  the news  why do you  look good  guys I realize  we haven't even  taken a break  we're being yelled  at  I just saw Tom  poke his head in  he has every right 
[02:06:00]  to because we  might not be able  to get all the  oops  here's the deal  we're going to  take a quick break  when we get back  we're going to  end the show  a little differently  hold the sign  in front of him  next time  maybe  maybe  maybe  maybe  we'll see what  happens after the  break  it's the Opie and  Anthony show  but Rosie's a  slob  she's crude  she's tough  she's arrogant  she's pushy  she's disgusting  in certain ways  she's a degenerate  people hate Rosie  she's a degenerate  I don't want to  talk to her 
[02:06:30]  when somebody  attacks me  I attack them  back  he should attack  back  although I just  didn't like the  fact that he  kind of went to  the lawyers  that annoys me  because again  you associate  yourself with the  casinos or  whatever it is so  hard so come on  man you can't  cry about that now  but it is nice  to see him  smashing her  fat face  honestly  alright  hey  during the break  Travis came  running in here  we just stink  yeah  as a show  we stink  we're horrid  I know we  entertain people  on a daily basis  but in general  we just stink 
[02:07:00]  we don't know  anything  we have horrible  instincts on certain  things  we claim to know  a lot but then  we realize we  just stink  and we don't  know much  talk about a  ball drop here  we dropped the  ball  you did  I fought  I know what  you're saying  I fought for  this particular  situation to happen  you did not  I did  liar liar  pants  as you kicked  the CD  across the studio  no I didn't  I was handing  it back to  someone  Travis  although we've  heard this  you gotta say  it again  here now  alright  a couple months  ago  Roland approached 
[02:07:30]  you guys  with a band  that he liked  nobody had heard  him yet  you guys could  have been  you know  could have  broken him  now Roland  is the guy  that gets us  our guests  and a lot  of times  he'll present  us with  people that  perhaps he  thinks is a  good guest  and we  think stinks  and we  will say  no we  don't want  that person  as a guest  and he  offered us  a band  he was very  passionate about  this band  he's like  guys here's  the CD  I like them  I think  you're gonna  like them  give them  a listen  they want  to come  in  they want  to play  for you 
[02:08:00]  guys  they want  to become  friends  of the show  right  Roland  yeah  that's all  you got  oh yeah  no they were  by the way  Roland can't  talk  why  because he's  retarded  I don't know  why  I thought  anybody was  sick  I am sick  too  oh what's  the matter  I don't  care  he gets  nervous  and can't  talk on  mic  yeah  it's a good  CD  they want  to come  in and  play the  single  what's up  with the  t-shirt  save the  cheerleader  oh it's  Heroes  the NBC  show  right  it's good  they want  to play 
[02:08:30]  the single  no they want  to play  a couple  songs for  you guys  why is  that show  good  it has  action in  it  it's about  they have  super powers  and they  don't know  quite yet  how far  they can  take their  powers  look how  flustered  he gets  he can't  even  speak  oh my  god  and that's 
[02:09:00]  why  you like  the show  man I can't  wait to check  it out  it makes me  want to just  leave right  now and watch  it  see any movies  during the  holidays  yeah I saw  quite a few  what was your  favorite movie  during the  holidays  mine was  The King  of Scotland  I think  Forrest Whitaker  might win an  Oscar for his  role  that's  Idi Ami  yeah  nice Oscar  you're keeping  it very nice  what  Dream Girls  you saw  Dream Girls  yeah 
[02:09:30]  is that your  favorite movie  no  Pursuit of Happiness  was really good  with Will Smith  why was Pursuit of Happiness  really good with Will Smith  it's a true story  about the guy  who was down on his luck  became homeless  and then triumphed  at the end  what movie is it  Will Smith  Pursuit of Happiness  great  and then  what else  Notes from a Scandal  what  Notes from a Scandal  Kate Blanchett  who  Kate Blanchett  Kate Blanchett  Kate Blanchett  God I hope Al's 
[02:10:00]  getting that down the hall  I know  Al I think  we got a problem  breaking some FCC rules  here  Kate Blanchett  what's her name  Kate Blanchett  you get that out  Kate Blanchett  Kate Blanchett  Kate Blanchett  one more time  Kate Blanchett  why are you out of the side  you're not telling a secret  to someone  that's how he talks  like he's telling secrets  always  that's a good movie  so looking straight ahead  Kate Blanchett 
[02:10:30]  to the side  so and the movie's  called what again  Nuts of a Scandal  alright  and why is that movie good  it's about  like Judy Dench  she's like the evil person  and  Kate Blanchett  didn't  didn't really  help her  and  shenanigans  and chaos pursue  wow  both of them  sounds like a buddy movie  wow  oh my god  who  he is 
[02:11:00]  sweating  profusely  and just  cannot  gather  his  words  you are  a mess  sweat's pouring  from your forehead  did you see that  a minute ago  did you see that  the museum movie  oh yeah  how was that  night at  night at the museum  right  I saw an IMAX  and still  wasn't as good  it was just kind of  what's it about  Ben Stiller  is like a 
[02:11:30]  divorced dad  Ben Stiller  people store things in him  he's a divorced dad  so I'm a Ben  Laden  he has his act  together  find a job  and he  stumbles upon  the museum  and goes  applies for a job  you stumble upon  a museum  oops  oh there's a museum  I tripped over it  he walks by  he goes  to the museum  and he goes in there  applies for the job  well he gets it  no he didn't  is he getting this  all wrong  of course he is 
[02:12:00]  I don't know  he gets a job  he's a museum  security guy  things come alive  oh my goodness  and then  nobody believes him  and everything  ends happily  he is the greatest  find of the last few years  movie reviews are  fantastic  yeah I love  Roland's movie review  makes me want to just  run out  and shoot myself 
[02:12:30]  now you saw  Last King of Scotland  yeah  what's that movie about  because that's a film  that a lot of people  aren't going to see  because it's mostly  in the artsy theaters  yeah it's  Forest Whitaker  he's a king  a king  or something  of Scotland  I haven't saw  a lot of people  oh my god  he's the king of Scotland  wait a minute  are you  you are  you did  he's the king of Scotland  no but  he plays  whatever  who does he play  I forgot the guy  William Wallace 
[02:13:00]  you forgot the guy's name  I did  I had it in my head  a minute ago  Idi Amin  there you go  Idi Amin  the evil dictator  of Uganda  who does he play  Idi Amin  alright  it sounds like you said  idiot me  which is appropriate  I don't care  and what's  what's the movie about there  he befriends  like  I believe  was it like a journalist  I think  I don't remember  too much of it  or a doctor 
[02:13:30]  a doctor  there you go  writes about medicine  where he's a doctor  who writes  that's right  he becomes his personal doctor  they become  friends or whatever  then  shooting happens  people die  and  people hate him  and they like  uproar  he goes back home  and everybody's happy again  I don't know  I don't remember  is he pursued by chaos  and shenanigans  similar yeah  is Judy Dinch in it 
[02:14:00]  no  Judy Dinch  how about  Bin Stiller  now I feel better  about our decision  with this band now  because this is the same guy  that brought us this band  this is how he pitched it  he basically said  this is going to be  the next big band  I like them  you guys are going to like them  here's a CD  play a song  tell me what you think  they want to come in  they want to be friends  of the show  you guys could be on this band  very early  right  yeah  and the name of the band  Cold War Kids  Cold War Kids  hot band right now  so we took the CD 
[02:14:30]  and  well we destroyed the CD  yeah  not just destroyed it  destroyed it  and said something like  take  what was the quote  I think  take this  poop  and threw it at me  yeah  that's right  we threw it at his head  and then the S word  threw it at  Roland's head  because we're thinking  what does this babbling idiot  know  that's what we're all thinking  like don't tell us  what  what good music is  yeah  so anyway 
[02:15:00]  Travis  you want to give us  the update on  Cold War Kids  well  since you threw the CD  at Roland  they've appeared on  Letterman  they were  named the It Band  by Rolling Stone  they were on  Spin Magazine's  top albums of the year  Rolling Stone  gave their album  4 out of 5 stars  and now  they're touring  with another  big It Band  opening for  Clap Your Hand  Say Yeah  which is pretty big 
[02:15:30]  and aren't they saying  they're going to be  one of the biggest bands  of 007  the 007  the 007  everything you just said  makes me confirm  our decision  everything  Rolling Stone Magazine  stinks  because who was  never on the cover  exactly  Black Sabbath  well I just don't like  the magazine  I'm tired  they're arrogant  and them being  a Rolling Stone  picker means nothing  to me  so I'm good for us  and good for me  for throwing that CD  at you  Cold War Kids  stink  Rolling Stone's a sponsor 
[02:16:00]  are they?  I'm kidding  oh  he got nervous  for a second  I was waiting  I was waiting for the  daughter  and five year old  Tom to run  into the sky  five year old  Tom  why are you calling him  five year old Tom  I don't know  I don't know  because apparently  he has braces now  and he's a big child  yeah  it's adorable  he's going to run in  with like a  psychedelic lollipop  and knickers  giant  all day  sucker  just like Angus Young 
[02:16:30]  with an oversized  lollipop  they're a sponsor  guys  oh is he staring  at the back of your head  right now  is he  oh yeah  we go out that door  right when we leave  yeah  don't go that way  don't talk to anybody  alright well  so  the band is  pretty huge  and  we had the opportunity  to be  on top of that one  early  and of course  and once again  just like the  Godsmack story  we blew it  good for us  we blew it again  good for us  we blew it 
[02:17:00]  Cold Water Kids  are  bums  Cold Water Kids  Cold Water Kids  what are they called  that band probably is  no wait no  those are the  Yates children  I mean  hey uh  Syracuse  thanks  if you  if you checked  this out  in Syracuse  today  and we piqued  your interest  go to our  website  opie  and  anthony  dot com  even if you  hated us  even if you  hated us  sure  go check out  the website  you might find  some interesting  things  Godspeed  Beaner  and  see I forgot

[02:33:30]  Creeps, ankle biters.  Obviously, the strength is their ability to turn mistruth into something people would believe.  Wow, how long is this guy going to continue to babble and say nothing?  All day long.  Shut up.  All right, here we go.  Welcome to the Opie and Anthony Show. 
[02:34:00]  It's worse than I imagined.  That's terrible.  I'm sorry.  We are a bunch of dopes.  I think we're lewd.  We're probably pushing 20 arrests because of this radio show.  Out of touch, corn balls, three retards.  We have the effect of Tylenol PM.  Opie.  You know I could have been a model.  Anthony.  I'm dead.  James Norton.  I like yogurt.  Robert Reed.  But enough of this palaver. 
[02:34:30]  Let's get the show on the road.  Ah, yes.  Let's get the show on the road.  We were just on the road.  It should be.  Let's get the show in a nice, warm studio where we belong.  That was a fine walkover today.  I like that one.  Yeah.  That was a lot of fun.  We got a bunch of people coming up.  Yeah, a lot of people to mess with today. 
[02:35:00]  It's a whole thing.  A whole bunch of people.  Yeah, we got the Georgia couple.  They've been married 30 years.  We got Big A.  We got others coming up.  Big A's not coming up yet to work.  He got two words out today.  He was such a new...  Yeah, what's wrong?  What a muttering, stuttering ass.  Old E-rock neck.  That's what I call Big A.  And how is his colon?  It's got to be awful.  How is his colon?  Where did that come from?  Because he went and got that chronic thing.  Or whatever. 
[02:35:30]  And they said he was impacted really bad.  We got free Starbucks today?  It's from...  Patty sent it over yesterday after the show.  I didn't send it over.  Why did you...  Gift to the show.  It's gifts for everybody.  Because I wasn't around for Christmas.  So I figured I'd give you a present to shut up.  Oh, thank you, Patty.  How nice.  What did she...  What did she give us?  I'm going to have one peppermint truffle.  No, I'm not.  Give me a...  Give me a...  Great.  You want any more?  No, none.  Dark chocolate peppermint truffles. 
[02:36:00]  Okay.  I accept.  I gave mine away.  I'm the biggest asshole ever.  Look at the Christmas blend, Opie.  It's Christmas blend.  Thank you, Patty.  Thank you.  Oh, it smells so coffee-y.  See, I'm pal talking.  Let me pop her.  I'll pop her video up.  There she is.  Thank you, Patty.  Thank you.  Let's all wave to Patty on Pal Talk.  Thank you, Patty.  Thank you.  Can I have the camera?  I want to thank Patty, too.  Her camera.  Can I have the camera? 
[02:36:30]  Yeah, I'll move it.  What do I do?  Oh, you're on camera.  Where?  Where?  Where?  Yeah, right into there.  No, I want a close-up.  I want a close-up so I can thank Patty.  All right, move it slower.  It self-destructs.  Okay.  There you go.  For some reason, you move those cameras too fast.  I can even go up here if I happen.  Hey, pop it up there.  All right, tell me.  Pop that fucker there for a moment.  All right.  Tell me when I'm on camera.  I rarely go on camera, by the way.  Wow, you are on camera.  Can Patty see me? 
[02:37:00]  Yes, she can.  Patty, yes.  Hold your face.  How about now?  Now, you're right there to your crotch line, pretty much.  Yeah.  Patty?  Patty?  Yeah.  This is what I think of your Christmas gifts.  Okay.  Oh, fuck.  We need an intern that's low on the totem pole to clean Opie's spit off of the orbit cam.  Ah, fuck. 
[02:37:30]  Get some Windex and paper towels.  I guess I'll lick it off.  I'll lick it off.  Look at the camera.  Look.  Oh, shit.  It's salty.  It's dust.  You're eating dust.  That is disgusting.  I hope somebody was here late at night jerking off on that camera and just did a firel doing  a money shot all over the front of it.  How much is this for, Patty?  She gave us Starbucks cards.  That's why I was laughing, and I have no problem showing people how awful I am. 
[02:38:00]  I opened up her...  Ew!  I laughed my ass off, too.  What is this?  What is it?  We got a Starbucks card.  Yeah.  And most people out there would say, hey, it's the thought that counts.  And I guess you're right, people, but I can't help but laugh that there's only $5 on the  card.  Five bucks?  What the fuck am I going to do with $5?  No $5?  Don't get your $4. 
[02:38:30]  You got to shit on it.  You got to shit all over it.  Happy holidays.  I gave you a decaf so you can enjoy coffee without caffeine.  Enjoy $5.  If this is decaf...  $5.  Five lousy dollars.  Five dollars.  How do you know if it's decaf? 
[02:39:00]  Where did you say decaf?  No, that's just for Anthony.  I got decaf.  I don't drink caffeinated beverages.  She knows that Anthony doesn't drink the...  Oh, can I...  Can I re-gift this?  Ben.  Thank you, Patty.  Yeah, that's wonderful.  Let me see that.  Ahem.  What?  What?  I just want to see this.  It's like a free coffee drink.  What are you looking at?  Uh...  No, I'll use your...  Wait. 
[02:39:30]  There we go.  Now you have four of them for $1.25 each.  You know what?  Here's Patty.  How much is that?  This is a 50.  It got in my stack of hundreds.  I don't even...  Five dollars?  It's not the thought that counts. 
[02:40:00]  You know somebody is going to quickly tape that 50 together.  Spread that around, guys.  Buy yourself some lunch today.  Take that 50.  I'll be a good guy.  All right.  Well, let's...  Oh, where'd the other half go?  I don't know.  I don't know.  You got to put it together.  Shazam.  That probably went under there.  Here, you could also tape together the $5 gift card.  Can you find it?  Yeah, we'll find it.  Well, I don't hope so.  Uh...  Stop with the sleepy thing, dude. 
[02:40:30]  We already, like...  We already talked about that.  What?  This guy.  Is someone bitching?  Hey, Opie, you sound sleepy.  Maybe you shouldn't drink decaf.  Sleepy?  It's his bit to, like, call one of us out every day and say we're sleepy.  And we already acknowledged you, sweet salad, a.k.a.  Ace...  Ace danger?  The fuck does that mean?  Where'd it go?  Where's your 50?  You can't find the other half.  That makes me so happy.  It fell, like, right there.  If you does find...  If I find it, I'm gonna eat it. 
[02:41:00]  Ooh.  God knows.  You got it?  It's lunch for all you guys.  I know.  And now that you only got half, get a Jew in here pronto.  Have them sniff it out.  I hear they can do that.  All right, listen.  We have some stories to cover today.  Thank you, Patty, for my...  We do, and we also...  One dollar drink card, Angel.  We should get Roland back in here, because we got a Roland rap song.  Ew.  Do we have that in front of us?  A Roland rap song?  Yeah.  We'll have to check it out.  But first, yes, we teased this on the way over. 
[02:41:30]  We should get into this really fast.  Tom in Philly.  Tom, what's up?  Good morning, boys.  Hey.  What happened to the Box of Cox?  Why is Elo trying to destroy the show?  Where's Elo?  Yeah.  Can we get to the bottom of the Box of Cox controversy?  You'll get to the bottom of it.  Because I remember what's in the bottom.  A big cock.  What happened to that?  Huh?  What about...  And there was the whole thing about Ron and Fez getting their own channel.  Do you think we know everything that goes on with the Ron and Fez show, sir? 
[02:42:00]  We do.  But...  Listen.  Where is Elo?  Could someone...  He's not here.  Punching out.  Is he coming over here?  Elo is stopping the Box of Cox bit.  He rarely stops a bit.  No, he usually doesn't.  Better not.  He called late last night, and there was no fight in me.  There was no fight...  Yeah.  ...in me.  Three words.  Right. 
[02:42:30]  So I was like, we'll talk tomorrow.  So we've got to get to the bottom of it today.  I want to know why Box of Cox is being banned from the Opie and Anthony show.  I say Box of Gaping Man Assholes.  I couldn't agree more.  If they don't want Box of Cox...  Oh my God.  And if Elo...  Box of Cunt.  Box of Cunts.  And if Elo doesn't call immediately, I'm going to suggest that the pest start sending  email to Mr. Elo asking why Box of Cox...  Right.  ...is being banned from the Opie and Anthony show. 
[02:43:00]  But I suggest that they send dignified emails...  That's right.  ...not ones that are disguised as one thing with a cock photo in it.  Well, you may want to go, what is wrong with Box of Cox?  And then you might have to, you know, send a...  It's his OCD.  I knew it.  No, it's not.  It's his neighborhood rubbing off on him.  I knew it.  I knew it.  You lost $50. 
[02:43:30]  You lost...  Here it is.  Right here.  Right here.  I don't care.  I don't care because it's for the guys.  Fuck the guys.  It's right in their mouth.  Just give them another $50.  Give them another $50.  I only have hundreds.  Well, give them a hundred, though.  What's with this wrestling thing?  What's with this fucking homoerotic...  You're rocking his...  I know.  Wow.  There is...  Oh, there it is.  You found it?  Right there.  There it is.  All right, now we can finally do the show.  Yeah, we can do the show now. 
[02:44:00]  I gave myself a paper cut.  You...  Who's this...  I'm bleeding.  Oh, these are signed by John Cena.  I don't want to throw these.  Paper cuts suck.  Nah, leave it a mess.  I could give a shit.  All right.  Let fucking Ronnie deal with it.  Wowee.  Yeah, that Ronnie's becoming a problem.  I gotta tell you.  Here we go again.  Every few months...  He's really...  Ah, these things gotta happen.  Every few months...  He's really getting under my nerves.  I gotta tell you.  Get rid of the bad blood.  He really, really... 
[02:44:30]  How could he not?  All right, anyway...  Yeah, give me a band-aid.  Where were we?  The faggot that I am.  What are we doing?  Oh, honey, I got a paper cut.  Band-aid for my paper cut.  You two are chatting.  Oh, yeah.  Well, Paul from Long Island will get us on track here.  Paul, go ahead.  Yeah, I guess how Elo is cock-blocking the box of cocks.  He absolutely is.  And he better explain himself.  We're going to...  There's no reason we can't do this, or at least figure out a way it can be done.  What's the worry? 
[02:45:00]  What is the worry here?  I think I know.  That a child will pass by?  It might be illegal in the community to expose pornography like that.  I'm taking a total stab at it.  Because, like, you know how to cover the windows?  It's indecent or something?  There might be a real legal reason for it.  Cover the windows?  No, no.  In porno shops, you can't show a cop.  Yeah, I know, but we're not.  You have to actually make a concerted effort to open the lid.  Yeah, man.  We were just taking a little chance.  However...  We have to take a chance every once in a while with this career of ours. 
[02:45:30]  Absolutely.  Imagine being fired for a box of cocks.  Oh, that would be...  Box of cocks.  How would they put that in the fucking paper?  They would just put a box of pornographic material.  They couldn't print box of cocks.  That is hot and sexy.  Cock of Sam, they would call it.  Put your little band-aid on?  I got to put my little band-aid on my little paper cut.  Oh, imagine if that was on your cock hole.  Oh, ow.  Or crush your eyeball.  Well, I got to communicate out to Elo.  Oh, he wrote back already. 
[02:46:00]  Already?  Where is he?  I thought he was here.  Number.  What do you mean, number?  Number?  What does that even mean?  Hotline.  Oh, you...  Hotline ass...  He doesn't have the hotline number?  I like that.  Don't call him an asshole.  Oh, sorry.  He's hotline, you fucking...  Oh!  Just give out the number on the air.  It's a boy.  Oh.  Send.  Can't we give out...  That's what I do.  Can't we give out the number on the air?  No.  I want a free FM fucking thing like you're wearing. 
[02:46:30]  He rockled it up.  Probably won the same size as you.  Someone's suggesting we do box of cobras instead.  See?  You know, that's probably legal.  As long as people don't look at pornography,  we don't care if they get a venomous bite to the fucking nose.  God damn, that is funny.  I got it.  What?  How about box of duty?  We take a big piece of shit and put it in a fucking...  What's wrong with box of shit?  That's a good one.  Box of shit.  Box of duty.  Wow.  Elo.  We all take... 
[02:47:00]  Just bit a huge pile.  How do you guys leave free FM and I'm still here?  I don't know.  Why are you there?  We didn't...  I didn't...  Yeah, why?  I'm trying to sign JV and Elvis.  They're the next big hot thing.  I like that one.  Sorry.  Good one, boss.  Yeah.  Okay.  Who's calling me from D.C.?  Go away.  I don't want to talk to you people.  All right.  Hi, guys.  Sorry I missed you. 
[02:47:30]  I was in with Mr. Chisano for it.  With little Tommy Chisano?  Yeah, five-year-old Tommy.  Five-year-old little Tommy Chisano?  Did you get him a gobstopper to shut him up?  He's like...  He's got to be 11 or 12, though.  I mean, who gets braces at 90?  Stop making fun of me.  Stop it.  Yeah, he's got braces and he's got to be pushing 60 at this point.  I was chatting about his braces to him and he's had them on a few weeks and he's got to  keep on for a year.  And he says it's very hard to eat. 
[02:48:00]  Why?  Does he start getting hairs down there?  What the fuck's the matter with him?  Who at that...  He's no kid.  No.  Why'd he need dentures in three years?  I mean, at that point, you just say, who cares?  Take him out.  You know what it is?  I'll tell you exactly what it is.  Tom's the kind of guy.  He's always been like that good-looking guy.  He wears a suit very well.  He's always been that guy.  He's the American Psycho guy, but older now.  American Psycho guy. 
[02:48:30]  So he takes care of himself and he must have decided at some point that he needed braces  and he doesn't care how old he is or how silly it is to have braces.  Well, I'm 35.  I need a lot of things, like a few more inches, a few more pounds, but it's like, I am what  I am, you know?  That's a great way to look at it.  I mean, what are you on, the E-Rock philosophy?  Exactly.  You need a few more pounds?  What's that?  To lose, he means, right?  Yeah, lose more pounds.  I could always lose weight.  Go take lipo.  I could do what Bubba the Love Sponge does and staple my stomach. 
[02:49:00]  I mean, I can do all that.  Oh, does he do that?  Yeah.  He's still around?  The rumor is.  Anyway, so, you know, Elo.  I know, you're not happy with me.  You and I talked for an hour and then it was the, oh, this ass.  I got to tell you what Elo does.  He's a corporate ass.  He goes, this is how he tells us we can't do one of the greatest bits that we've come  up with in the last year.  He goes, I got some good news and some bad news.  And then he gives some unbelievable news about us and the channel and XM. 
[02:49:30]  I see through this crap.  I know you do.  But it doesn't mean I can't.  You're a corporate ass.  What's the good news?  What book did you read that in?  Well, before you give really bad news, make sure you give some really, really good news.  Give some good news.  Even if you have to make it up.  You know what it's called?  It's called the cold prickly and the warm fuzzy.  Is that what it's really called in corporate terms?  Yeah, that's what they'll tell you.  So he gives this good news.  You guys, I got to tell you, I don't even know if I'm allowed to say what you told me, 
[02:50:00]  but basically we're doing, we're like the number one channel on XM, something like that?  No, you're not like, you are.  All right.  We're the number one channel.  We have more listeners than Howard as far as just the satellite radio goes and this  and that.  You guys are doing this and that and blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.  Oh, by the way, can't do Box of Cox.  I'll see you tomorrow morning.  It hangs up.  What the fuck?  What, what, what?  Yeah.  Well, it was the kickoff of the Sugar Bowl, so I had a lot of money on the game.  I had to go.  Were legal brought into this? 
[02:50:30]  No, legal was not brought in.  Just you.  Just me.  The legal mind of Mr. Eric Logan.  Or the illegal mind.  It's actually called the legal prevention mind.  The legal prevention mind.  Now, what, what do you see bad about Box of Cox?  Let's discuss.  Here, we'll discuss and, and I'll tell you the same thing I said to Opie.  I said, listen, I'll be happy to sit down with the, with the rooms of attorneys and run  the traps.  But I, you know, my experience leads me to believe that I know where we're going to wind  up. 
[02:51:00]  So here's the issue.  The issue is that you have a box on the sidewalk in Manhattan.  Yeah.  That has, uh, wires, antennas, abandoned box.  Now, let us forget that that also may bring the bomb squad with it.  Wait, wires, antennas.  We haven't gotten that far yet.  No, we haven't gotten that far yet.  And, and, and, and, and, and even if we had, um, I, I think that's still okay.  Okay.  Well, I think you're going to get the bomb squad in about five minutes.  We have a guy out there.  The bomb squad came, if a cop came, they would go, no, this is what it is. 
[02:51:30]  We have a guy out there.  Okay.  Well, here's, here's the problem.  The problem is unsolicited, somebody opening a box, same pornographic material under the  auspice of free puppies is going to get you guys in trouble.  What if we put free puppy and porno?  Free puppy and porno may work.  How about this?  Free puppy and there's a piece of shit in there, which you could just as easily see opening  if there was a dog in there.  Free puppy and poop? 
[02:52:00]  No, just free puppy and they open it up and there's a log of shit in it.  I just think you guys are asking for trouble.  How does Candid Camera and all these other fucking shows get away with deceiving people  on video?  Well, they're not deceiving people.  Yeah, they are absolutely deceiving people.  Because they, because what happens is, as you know, when they, but first of all, most of  the shows rarely, most of the shows don't exist anymore in the way they used to, as you  know.  Huh?  What?  They don't exist like that.  How about Punk'd?  Punk'd. 
[02:52:30]  Name another one.  But Punk'd also, by the way, how?  Borat.  Okay, well, how many lawsuits?  Dayline Pedophile Special.  Yeah, right.  Those guys, those poor sons of bitches.  That's Boxo Cox.  How many lawsuits does Borat have?  None.  One.  No.  No, no, he has 15 lawsuits.  Fake lawsuits, though.  No, no, no.  15 lawsuits, but everyone knows the show, the movie.  Yeah, but guess what?  Borat's going to pay them to go away.  Yeah, not a lot, though.  15, that's a fair trade.  It's a, you know, a fine line. 
[02:53:00]  You've got to judge if the consequence is worth the good for the show.  Now, we're saying that we need to do things for this program.  Like Boxo Cox.  Both here and on our FM show.  That will, you know, make some noise, shake up some shit.  But until we're able to do that, you know, we're not going to feel good.  No, I hear you.  I understand.  We've got to keep our number one status here, Mr.  That's right. 
[02:53:30]  So we have to work out a way where we can do Boxo Cox or something that can be worked out that is just as good.  Fine.  If that's what you want me to do, I will get on it today, and I will come back to you with an answer of how we can do Boxo Cox.  I mean, listen, just like Money Snatch, couldn't do it over at Free FM or over here, but we can do it over there, and we just figured out a way to do it.  I suggest you talk to the lawyers pronto, or this bit becomes Elo's inbox of Cox.  Oh, shit. 
[02:54:00]  I haven't.  Is that where you print out all the emails we have gotten from Elo and tape them to the inside of the box?  No, it's when I print out all the emails that I get of all the Cox in my office.  There you go.  That's right.  Yeah, no, I know exactly what he meant.  Look at you asking for it.  Oh, please, please send them.  Yeah, no, no.  How about this?  How about we can put marshmallows in it instead and call it Boxo Marshmallows?  Elo's inbox of Cox.  You're finally getting it?  Jesus.  I didn't understand that the pest would have been involved.  Oh, no, I got it.  No.  How about unclipped is his preference. 
[02:54:30]  Send unclipped, lots of foreskin preferred.  Well, no, we give him a day to make sure we continue with this.  Yeah, of course.  With this.  Yeah, so pests don't do it.  One day.  He gets 24 hours before it turns into Elo's inbox of Cox.  I need at least until the end of the show tomorrow to figure out how I can get this done.  To the end of the show tomorrow.  Right.  Now, that's the weekend.  Come on.  And then we're in Vegas. 
[02:55:00]  We know your corporate way.  Look at you.  No.  You got 24 hours from right now.  That's right.  They don't bargain in the Old West.  What is this?  I mean, I feel like I'm Jack Bauer now.  I feel like I'm on an episode of 24.  Or he gets a mailbox full of cocks.  You better start growing that beard.  We turn over to the Chinese people and electrocute it.  So, no, we got to do the best.  Does anybody remember last time? 
[02:55:30]  I kill Rich Tunnel.  Boring.  Boring.  God damn rich cunt.  That's not true.  I've seen the stock price.  I thought it was going up.  What happened?  Yeah.  Hold on.  What are we doing?  What are we doing today?  It's all good.  I don't know.  We're like 15 and some change.  We went up.  Yeah.  Went up yesterday.  Yeah, it's not 30.  Is 30 better?  Well, that's where it used to be.  Yeah.  Wasn't it in the 40s at one point?  Oh, yeah. 
[02:56:00]  Ah, you know.  All right.  Well, if I've got 24 hours to clock, let's synchronize our watches.  What do you have?  940.  7 a.m.  Yeah.  Okay.  All right.  939.  You want to call at 939 tomorrow.  939.  All right.  Where am I going to be tomorrow at 939?  Hold on a second here.  Which, by the way, we're doing the bit tomorrow.  So.  Yeah.  939.  Okay.  I got a media.  Oh, great.  I got the company call tomorrow at 9 a.m. 
[02:56:30]  Lovely.  All right.  All right.  Then call us at 839.  You got 23 hours.  23 hours.  You just cut yourself an hour.  Okay.  We're still on FM.  Fuck.  Pest.  Pest.  Go to alert status.  You're on alert status.  Collect your ammunition.  Find some of the best pictures of cocks that you can.  Dude, but don't get anywhere a cock is in an older gentleman's mouth.  That would be disgusting. 
[02:57:00]  And definitely don't go to any medical sites and get diseased or infected cocks because  Elo would hate opening that.  No, that's not fair.  Nothing worse than a syphilis cock.  Keep it fair.  Keep it fair.  No, do not send them until his time.  And by the way, if I get one, if I get one, I get an extra 24 hours.  No, because you'll send it to yourself.  No, no.  That's the deal.  No, that's not.  No, no.  The hostage negotiation has a give and take.  If I get one email from a test.  You don't get nothing.  We can't control the test.  You know that.  One dick will slip through the crack. 
[02:57:30]  Absolutely.  One dick.  I'm going to tell you by the time I'm off this call, I'm going to have a dick in my email.  A dick in your email?  Whoa.  All right.  Be careful.  Just you and the emails that Don sent back and forth privately.  Yeah.  Speaking of Don, here it is.  Okay.  Dick in my email.  I won't make line of the day, but it could get close.  No.  Wow.  Some people are, what's that, abandoning the show?  People are upset with Elo.  I don't know why.  Why?  What do I do now? 
[02:58:00]  On the phone.  Oh, yeah.  I don't know.  Yeah.  Hold on a minute.  Let's say hi to Turtle from Whack Bag.  Turtle.  Hey there, Turtle.  Hey, guys.  I just wanted to thank Elo for abandoning the show so soon.  You suck.  Wow.  See how they turn on you, Elo?  Great.  Look at how the pests turn on you.  Wow.  One less email.  Oh, thank you.  No, that's about 20 more.  Exactly.  I know that guy.  He'll send them to you.  Turtle.  Oh, Christ.  So how did I abandon the show? 
[02:58:30]  Because I won't let you do Bach the Cock?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  You're the face that's put on this corporate reasoning that we can't do it.  It needs a face, and that face is you.  Right.  So you know how it works.  You know how the corporate world works.  We know how the pest world works.  Yes, that's true.  They hear that we can't do it.  You made the phone call to Opie, and that's all they know.  You abandoned the show.  That's right.  Box?  I'm just trying to save another Opie and Dopey headline. 
[02:59:00]  No.  No.  If, if...  How about, um...  Could we do box of shit?  Top of your head.  Box of shit.  Probably think it's going to be a problem.  How about if we actually give it to a homeless person and say it's a sandwich?  I think there's going to be some health issues with that.  How about box of good feelings and money?  I like that one.  There's got to be something.  Severed head?  Listen, I mean...  How about box of, uh... 
[02:59:30]  Iraq belly photos?  Hmm.  Sexy.  What could we put in there?  What about, uh...  A cake.  What about something that was called, um...  I remember a sex toy called Bottoms Up.  It was nothing but a big rubber ass.  And you couldn't really see the asshole unless you spread it open.  So it's just a rubber prop ass.  What about that?  How about, uh...  The pest suggests some other, uh...  Some other box-os. 
[03:00:00]  Box of...  Yeah, box-os.  Box of Elo's head.  No.  Although, uh...  They're ready.  Boy, do they want to send you those fucking pictures.  They're chomping at the bits.  Their index finger is getting all...  Oh.  You know they've just gotten the worst possible dick pictures.  As opposed to those real luscious ones they could be sending.  Can we send one picture to your email right now?  Fine.  Send one.  All right, Pess.  Just send one email. 
[03:00:30]  You guys figure out...  Amongst yourselves, which one do you want to send?  I'm going to delegate somebody...  To send just one.  Someone will get the honor of sending just one.  Actually, you know what?  I only want it to come from Dugout, Doug.  He's like...  Doug.  Doug.  He ain't going to send you just one.  No.  No, I know, but he should be...  He'll send you a real one severed in the mail.  What's in the box?  From the head of Wack Bag.  All right, I'm just trying to go to the top of the pest pecking order.  All right, well, you can't take away one of our greatest bits.  I will get on the phone, and I will give you the official legal answer as to how we can 
[03:01:00]  do it.  You know what bit we're going to do in 25 hours if we can't do this?  Sex with Sam.  Great.  Well, again, I don't think that...  Only church is on the list.  That's right.  That's great.  And mosques.  Mosques.  Mosques.  And synagogues.  And synagogues.  Right.  Well, let's say hi to Larry in Minnesota.  Larry?  Hi, Larry. 
[03:01:30]  Hey, how's it going, guys?  Hey, Larry, you got Elo, the boss of XM, on the air.  Yeah, I was thinking of a bit.  You guys could just take a whole bunch of pictures of Elo, and then just call it Box of  Pussies.  What do you think of that, Elo?  Box of Pussies.  Yeah.  But don't get alarmed, because it's not actual, like, pussies.  It'll just be pictures of you.  Oh, that's right.  Ah, nice one.  God, how do you turn?  Well, someone is suggesting Box OXM stocks.  Oh, wait. 
[03:02:00]  That's an empty box.  Yeah.  Oh, no.  That's over the line.  Let's say hi to Jeremy in Cleveland.  Jeremy?  Does anybody remember?  $30 a share?  Stop it.  Now, listen, Mr. Elo, I am going to forewarn you that if you kill this pig, you will have  an inbox of hating assholes just from me.  Stop, I'm gaping.  Punching out.  Jeremy will be sending Box.  Yeah.  All right, well.  Well, I mean, listen, I'm glad to see the love. 
[03:02:30]  Well, you know how this works.  I know how it works.  It's give and take.  You give, we take.  Yes, I know.  And there's never a give back.  I'm very well clear on that.  It's about time we get a little take, yes, because we've been giving and giving and giving.  We need to work this out.  It is a great, fun bit.  Everyone enjoyed it.  No one was damaged by it.  Even the people that saw the box of cocks that lifted that lid just walked away.  Listen, all it takes is one, as you guys know. 
[03:03:00]  And all it takes is crossing the street and getting hit by a trolley car.  That's right.  Or laying down on a subway track.  It can happen to anybody in 1850.  Look, we need to do the bit.  I understand.  I'll do what I can.  All right.  I mean, that's all I can tell you.  All right.  8.39.  All right.  Oh, no.  We can't do 8.39.  Yeah, the count goes on.  How long is your meeting tomorrow?  Well, it's Nate's call, so I'll be on like a 9, so I'll be off by 10, probably. 
[03:03:30]  What are you guys going to be talking about?  Oh, no.  What's Nate's email?  Bob Jones.  Listen, don't do that one.  No.  Why not?  I think I would recommend you guys have a meeting with the man before you do that.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Who is he?  I hear you.  How come Nate doesn't like us?  That's not true at all.  All right.  All right.  I just think you should meet him.  Yeah.  All right.  We'll meet him.  We'll work that out.  I know you will.  All right.  All right.  Well, I got a lot of work to do, apparently. 
[03:04:00]  Oh, you do?  Well, I got to get on the phone with the attorneys and figure out how to do Cox.  He has to make that phone call.  I know.  Right.  I mean, just so you're clear, I'm now going to call the general counsel.  Yeah.  All right.  And we have a few litigation issues with the company, I'm sure you're aware of, right?  Not really.  Yeah.  Well.  Can we conference you calling this lady?  That would make for some fine radio.  It's a lady?  No.  It won't be the lady.  Wow.  Yeah.  I'll try to steer clear of that. 
[03:04:30]  I'm serious.  Can we take that phone call on the air?  Well, according to FCC regulations, since they're actually the experts in that, they would know  that they'd have to grant permission.  So let me ask first.  Ask permission.  We'll just listen in.  That's all we want to do.  Yeah.  We want to see how you handle something like this on a corporate level.  Well, I mean, if you did that, you guys would actually have a little bit of appreciation  for what I do.  If I did that, I doubt it, but you never know.  It may stop one email.  I appreciate you, Eric. 
[03:05:00]  I know you do, Jim.  I meant Iraq.  All right.  We got to eat cereal.  Go eat cereal.  Much more important.  All right, boss.  Goodbye.  Bye, Eric.  There he goes.  That sucks.  We've got to figure it out.  Welcome to the Opie and Anthony Show.  The venomous voices of the vastly vulgar airwaves.  Introducing the Destroyer.  Operator of the OCD organization, Opie.  The Professor.  The know-it-all neurotic Nancy Anthony. 
[03:05:30]  Swing over to little Jimmy Dorton.  The worthless, chinless, bachsome master of laughs.  Meet the irritating extra of excrement E-Rock.  Or the swishy audio shim Steve C.  And don't forget Sam.  Black and white.  50-50 where it counts.  Corrupting the cavities of ear holes everywhere.  It's the Opie and Anthony Show.  Opie and Anthony! 
[03:06:00]  XM202.  The Vibes.  All right.  That was a nice thing.  Why don't you repeat that for the audience?  That's terrible.  I gave my truffles to Than.  I said, you know, spread them among the boys.  Give them a little treat today.  And Than did something with the truffles that Stalker Patty gave me for Christmas.  What?  I just handed them to E-Rock and said, eat these, fatso. 
[03:06:30]  Fatso.  Boy, that word is timeless, isn't it?  Oh.  Fatso.  Wonderful word.  I love the word fatso.  Hey, fatso.  Get a load of fatso there.  There's no coming back from being called a fatso.  Fatso is just, over the years, it has not gone away.  A fat person, you call him fatso.  Hey, fatso.  Come up with a better insult than fatso.  You can't.  Hey, so can someone go out there and ask Judy Blume book cover if he'll give me one of those? 
[03:07:00]  I wouldn't mind having a nice truffle, but I only want one.  I gave mine away.  What does Sabrina want?  Sabrina.  Hello, boys.  Hi, Sabrina.  Hi, Sabrina.  I was listening yesterday, and I wanted to call in, but it was on that playback.  Back thing on XM, and you were talking about the assault on the media, and I just, I had  to call and talk to you, because not that I want to upset the pests, because God knows  I know their wrath, but the pests here in Las Vegas, I don't think they quite understand 
[03:07:30]  the difference between television and radio.  I'm a radio news reporter, and I realized after listening to the show yesterday that they've  been holding up signs behind me, and I turn around, and I just feel like saying, do  you see a camera that I don't, because it doesn't make sense.  I think the whole thing is hilarious when you guys do it to TV people, but as far as  radio, I just find it kind of...  Wait, so you're doing some kind of radio report, and they're standing behind you with signs? 
[03:08:00]  Yeah, well, essentially in Las Vegas, radio covers as much as TV does, so we're all kind  of at the same thing, and I think when they get sued away from the TV people, they come  over to me, and I just, you know, I don't want to, I want to just turn around and be  like, oh, and a party rock, and just do what they say.  Yeah, so what was the story you were covering when one of the fans were behind you with the  sign?  It was a...  Oh, boy.  Okay.  That one I could say I saw coming a mile away. 
[03:08:30]  Yeah, well.  All right, hey, where's Roland?  We're not done with Roland today.  Who's the hot chick he's with?  Who is she?  He's been hanging with her for a long time.  Yeah, she's really solid, man.  It's his beard.  Roland.  Is that your girl?  No, she works for the same company as I do.  Oh, she's okay.  She's the backup, so if I get sick, she's here.  Where'd you get the Dunder Mifflin jacket?  NBC.  Yeah?  What is a Dunder Mifflin?  That's a good one.  That's from The Office.  That's where they work.  Oh, you like The Office? 
[03:09:00]  Yes.  I like The Office.  That's where they work.  Anthony likes The Office.  I like The Office.  Why do you like The Office?  It's funny.  Ricky Gervais.  I like the British version and also now Steve Carell's Office.  Yeah.  It's a funny show.  Why?  The American version is that one.  Yeah.  So why do you like the American version of The Office with Steve Carell?  It's just a funny show with Jenna Fisher plays Pam.  She's really great.  Just the whole stuff that happens in The Office. 
[03:09:30]  Yeah.  Shenanigans again.  Ah, Shenanigans again.  Yeah.  Shenanigans.  That's the number one thing that he seems to like in movies and TV are Shenanigans.  And chaos.  He likes the chaos.  A little bit of chaos in Shenanigans.  Roland, so who's your favorite character in The Office?  Shenanigans?  Dwight?  Dwight and Pam.  She's really good.  So you like Pam the best?  Yeah.  She's funny.  Why?  Why is she funny in The Office?  Just her, the way she, she's just funny.  Like her blogs too. 
[03:10:00]  She blogs as Pam on the internet.  Ah.  So it's just, she takes her character and runs with it.  What's, uh, what's better the American or the, uh, what's the different?  I like the British version though, because Ricky, I think, because he just, he just brought  it to life.  I gotta buy the British version.  Yeah.  Fox sets out, right?  Only two seasons.  Only 12 episodes of it.  Yeah.  Can't you get me that?  Yes.  How about this?  Get for Ant.  I, I don't ask for anything.  I'll get you that in the Christmas episode. 
[03:10:30]  It's a special one.  I didn't see that one yet.  I love the, so much I won't watch the last one because I'm, I'm depressed it's over.  Yeah.  It's, it's really good.  The Christmas one is depressing.  Don't humiliate me.  Okay.  Roland, Roland, there is now a rap song.  A Roland rap song done by Butcher Ed Brock.  Oh.  We featured some of his music on our show a few months back.  Who the fuck is Butcher Ed Brock?  This guy that can kill you.  Oh yeah.  The guy that looks like a superhero.  Oh, hi Butcher. 
[03:11:00]  Superhero.  Shazilch.  That's a good one.  And, uh, yeah.  What's up?  There you go.  I got nothing here.  What, between the headphones?  There you go, exactly.  Thank you.  I'm a dumbass.  My bad.  My bad.  What's going on, guys? 
[03:11:30]  What's up?  So you made a rap song for?  Yes, sir.  For my, uh, my good friend Roland.  Yeah?  It's a good guy.  You like it?  Who doesn't like Roland?  Are they getting thumbs up?  Yeah.  The Roland rap's getting thumbs up from the crew?  Well, we'll see if an actual, uh, African American enjoys it.  Sam, stick around, please.  I haven't seen it.  You haven't seen it.  I haven't seen it or heard it.  It's really tough to see a rap song, but a lot of people do see that.  Sam's capable.  They can see, uh, sound.  That's what I hear.  Yep.  Comes from the bigger bone, the thigh bone. 
[03:12:00]  Back in the day when, uh, they would breed, uh, for that better athlete could see, uh, sound.  I meant to say heard.  Oh, okay.  Well, yeah, we say that much, but we thought we'd have fun with it, God forbid.  You correct me, so I don't think we have fun with a slip-up on this show.  Jesus.  Uh, you rosy-cheeked little guy.  He's, you know who he is?  He's Prince Harry.  He's Prince Harry. 
[03:12:30]  Prince Harry.  Oh, shit.  That's a hot one.  Yeah.  Oh, when he came in from the cold in the elevator, these two old ladies were in the elevator.  It pissed me off, too, because, uh, I was fumbling for my phone, but the elevator was  moving too quick.  Believe that one in this fucking building, but I wanted to call Opie's phone, so it would  have said, I have kiddie porn on my computer.  I have kiddie porn on my computer with two old bags in the elevator.  I wish it did that.  And then I go to the bathroom with Jim, and I go, I gotta change this ringtone. 
[03:13:00]  He goes, there's gotta be a way to do it.  I go, no, you don't understand.  Physically, I can.  Emotionally, I can.  You're just fixed to it.  You get attached to it.  I need to continue, like, having that freak out every time the phone rings.  But those two old bags wanted to pinch your cheeks.  I saw when they came in there, they wanted, they were yearning to pinch your appley cheeks.  Because they looked like they'd just been pinched.  Right.  His cheeks always looked freshly pinched.  And then they thought, hell no, he may be a Negro.  That's right. 
[03:13:30]  They were white women.  They'll pinch his cheeks, and he'll get lynched for it.  That's not fair.  No justice in this world.  He has fresh, pinchable cheeks.  They always look like they've just been freshly pinched.  Prince Harry.  Appley red.  Appley red cheeks.  So where were you?  I was having my cheeks freshly pinched.  Oh, damn, man.  Someone is suggesting that Butch, his superhero name should be Aqua Headman. 
[03:14:00]  Aqua Headman.  Aqua Waterhead.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  All right.  Let's play this rap song.  All right.  So we have a job for Roland today.  When you need radio gold, he's the one that you call.  With happy movie reviews, wears his shirts extra small.  The one you can count on the book, I guess, for a session.  But ends every single sentence he says in a question.  No pronunciation, soft-spoken and mumbles.  Just try and put him behind the mic and he crumbles.  Babbling moron, that's for you to decide.  Bonadeus, Bonadeus, check him out Friday-wide. 
[03:14:30]  It's rolling, rolling, rolling, rolling.  It's rolling, rolling, rolling, rolling.  It's rolling, rolling, rolling, rolling.  It's rolling, rolling, rolling, rolling.  That was good.  Yeah.  Any action, suspense?  That's excellent.  Yeah.  I didn't even hear the final edit of that.  That's great.  Yeah, that's all right.  I like his stuff because a lot of white rappers try to be like Eminem, and he doesn't.  He does his own thing.  I like that.  A lot of those guys try to take that cadence. 
[03:15:00]  He didn't do that.  He's good.  You're going to watch white rap?  What is it called?  White rapper?  Yeah, the white rapper show.  Of course, the black guy knows.  I don't even know.  I've never even heard of it.  Are they doing that now?  Is it like an ad of it?  What is it on, VH1?  VH1 or MTV?  Let's see MTV run Black Lawyer.  It's white rapper, and is it like the whole real world type scenario?  It's like a game show.  Yeah, and somebody gets voted off.  It's a bunch of white people.  Yeah.  Another show where someone gets voted off.  Wait a minute.  Wait.  Is that a racially based thing?  Yes, they're all white people. 
[03:15:30]  Are they voting a black person off or something like that or no?  No, there's no white people.  There's no black people allowed.  It's the white rapper.  So it's a bunch of...  It's about white rappers.  I want to be white rappers.  Yeah, because...  Somebody I'm very close to created a show like that, and they didn't buy it, so I was  thinking they might have stolen it.  Oh!  Hoo-hoo.  No?  Yes.  Oh, can you get the E-Rock in here for a sec?  Sure.  I don't know.  Can you?  Sitting through that door?  Hey, Monty Python movie ending. 
[03:16:00]  Roll for me.  Jesus.  There you go.  You forgot an A and a T on your shirt.  He's got the 3FM sweatshirt, which is just the F logo.  That's good.  I'm teasing.  He knows I love them.  That's true.  Why don't you sit down, since you're obviously not going to do a sit-up.  All right, that's good. 
[03:16:30]  I just want to look at you.  That's right.  Oh, that's terrible.  There he goes back to the computer.  That's right.  All right.  Anyway.  Come on.  Bye.  Roland, we have a job for you today.  We want to play Meet the Audience with Roland.  We played from time to time.  We haven't done it in a while.  We got some fine listeners outside here.  We got about 10 or 12 in the studio today.  Yeah.  Studio audience.  Our studio audience.  Take your wireless mic, and let's meet the listeners with Roland. 
[03:17:00]  Roland's going to go out there.  He's got a very good interviewing style.  It's unique.  Yeah.  That's for sure.  One way to put it.  Here's Roland outside the studio.  I'm rushing over there.  Are there people rushing?  Why are there people leaving?  Where are they going?  Who's taking...  Wait, wait.  Hold on.  Hold on.  What happened?  Why are people being pulled away?  Why are they leaving?  Paul.  Paul.  Why is the guy in the Red Sox thing being taken away? 
[03:17:30]  They want to leave.  They're not being pulled away.  Paul, why are you making them leave?  Why do they want to leave?  You don't want to be interviewed by Roland?  No.  We have the NBC studio tour at 11 o'clock.  Ew.  Oh, my God.  I know.  It's not even like it's Los Angeles where you might see something.  Where are they going to take it?  And this is where Saturday Night Live is.  That's like the pinnacle of the whole tour.  That's what we're here for today.  Chuck Scarborough puts his wig after they eat salad out of it.  Yeah, but they're not even allowed in the studio. 
[03:18:00]  That's an L.  They'll all see it through the classroom.  No, they won't show you.  You know, right?  Yeah.  Were you a page over there or something?  No, I worked there for four years.  You worked there.  Did you see any celebrities?  Not doing a tour.  You worked the tour?  No, I went on a tour once.  You have to.  What did you do over there?  Work with Carson.  Oh, that was the Carson thing.  Oh, I thought that was out.  Both TRL.  Oh.  Oh, okay.  All right.  Well, you guys got to go.  30 Rock. 
[03:18:30]  The tour's at 11, though.  30 Rock.  Yeah, it says you've got to be there at 10.30, though, because they check you in and all  kinds of crap.  It's going to fucking blow that tour.  I know.  I know.  Yeah, this is where another unfunny sketch was done on SNL.  Fucking horrible.  What's the best part of the tour, Roland?  The end.  The end.  Oh, that was quick.  That's nice.  Quick everything.  I like that.  All right.  Get out of here.  Thanks, guys.  Tom DeLuise.  From Redding, PA.  Likes the Red Sox.  I don't remember you.  I'm fine, man.  Bye, Mom. 
[03:19:00]  Bye, Mom.  Sexy young girlfriend.  There it is.  Bye.  Is shower cap lady staying?  I love that dirty young girlfriend.  Who's shower cap lady?  Why'd I call her shower cap lady?  Is she still here?  Yeah.  No, that wasn't you.  No.  I wasn't calling you shower cap lady.  That was old lady wool hat lady.  Yeah.  Yes.  No, you're coal miner's daughter hat.  We're talking about fucking the other one.  I think shower cap lady left.  Shower cap lady hair left.  That was the mom. 
[03:19:30]  I know.  Yeah.  She did that thing that we always talk about.  What?  That ladies do.  What?  When they get a little older.  What?  They cut all their hair off.  Oh, yeah.  And it looks ridiculous.  Yeah, yeah.  And we always talk about how the husband's probably going, what the fuck?  Yeah.  Married a woman with long hair, used to run my fingers through it.  Yeah.  And now I got fucking Billy Idol with peroxide.  All right. 
[03:20:00]  We get the couple out there.  We get a couple out there.  Yeah, let's get Roland to interview our listeners and get to know the listeners.  We have 1990 me.  And fucking...  Yeah, he looks like a younger Jimmy Norton with his head shaved there.  Very good.  All right, Roland.  You know, take it away.  You got a few people to choose from.  Let's get to know these people.  What's your name?  Vinny.  Where are you from?  Long Island.  Okay.  You know, I got nothing.  I pumped.  All right.  I post this, I love dog shit on most of the boards. 
[03:20:30]  Oh.  Okay.  Forget it.  What's your name?  Wait, wait, Roland.  He just leaves and walks to someone else.  That's all you got?  You post as what?  I love dog shit.  That's your name?  Yes.  I'm not proud of it, sir.  All right.  I love dog shit.  What do you have a question about that?  Why did you pick that name?  I don't know.  I guess because I love dog shit. 
[03:21:00]  It was the easiest thing I could come up with.  I don't know.  What about...  Get into a little bit about what he does for a living, maybe.  What he does out on Long Island.  What do you do on Long Island?  I work at a high school.  Oh.  Shut up, would you?  What are you doing in the city?  Excuse me?  What are you doing in the city?  Yeah, actually, for an appointment.  And I got roped into this terrible interview.  Yeah.  Oh.  All right.  Now you...  I like the way he's beating on Roland. 
[03:21:30]  And now you get to ask Roland a question.  I don't know.  One question.  Anything.  Oh, it's not that easy, is it?  No, it's not, sir.  I never said I was good at this.  It should be.  I love smart-alecky remarks.  Right.  Can I plug my site?  If it's eat a bullet, you can.  Yeah, what's your site?  Go ahead.  Spread the Omnivirus.com.  Cool.  All right.  Let's go to the next guy there, Rome. 
[03:22:00]  What's your name?  Pete.  Where are you from?  Connecticut.  Connecticut.  What do you do?  We're going to machine shop.  All right.  What do you do?  Bridgeport?  What?  Yeah, Bridgeport.  The Bridgeport.  I used to work on the Bridgeport.  I don't know what that is.  It's a milling machine, you fucking faggot.  Oh.  You make things out of metal.  You take a big chunk of metal, and when you're done with it, it's a gadget or a gizmo or a fucking widget.  I'm not a faggot. 
[03:22:30]  I just thought the Bridgeport has something to do with cards.  Tee-hee.  No.  It's great.  You make armatures.  Make me an armature.  All right.  All right.  Continue rolling.  We're talking men things.  When men work dinosaurs.  Men in machine shops with Earl.  And I mean oil, not black gentlemen.  What are you doing in the city?  Just visiting before I leave for school.  Where do you go to school at?  Ohio.  Oh.  He just nods at them. 
[03:23:00]  Roll an interview tip.  You never say, oh.  Oh.  And then nod.  How about, since he's doing what I consider a pretty crappy job right now.  I understand he can make some money, but it really is despicable work.  Uh, what is he going to school for to maybe, you know, better himself?  What are you studying?  I'm working on, uh, studying cars.  Oh.  Oh, my God. 
[03:23:30]  Wow.  You're going to car school?  Yeah, I'm going to a car show to learn how to fix cars.  Make custom stuff.  Hot rod stuff.  Task fabrication.  Street rod stuff.  Uh-huh.  Are you good with, you're obviously good, because I was once fired, I worked at a bicycle  shop, and I was fired because I was not mechanically inclined.  Yeah, I guess I'm somewhat mechanically good and stuff.  Good.  All right, you got to, you get to ask Roland any question you want now. 
[03:24:00]  Yeah, I got, I got nothing too, so.  Wow.  Nothing?  All right, move on, Roland.  A fine batch, I might, I might say, came up today.  Yes.  What's your name?  Good morning, my name's Keith.  Where are you from?  I'm from Valdosta, Georgia.  Oh.  And, uh, we're here for our 30th wedding anniversary.  Oh, what a coincidence.  So is that lady.  Yes.  That lady is my wife.  See, because I know, geez, that was the whole, please, please hold.  Thank you.  I, he's so nervous, he actually said that lady is my wife. 
[03:24:30]  Yeah.  Wow.  I came to see little Jimmy.  Hi, sir.  You look like Bob Levy.  Holy shit, does he look like Levy.  Yeah, a little Bob Levy.  I don't know who Bob Levy is.  I know, he's a comedian.  I don't know who Bob Levy is.  He's a comedian.  No.  Said that.  Oh, my God.  I don't know what fun he is, either.  Slower pace there in Georgia.  Yeah.  Where, where, is it a big, big place in Georgia?  Big town?  Very, very, very small town.  Very small town in Georgia.  My wife's the biggest thing in town. 
[03:25:00]  Oh, she punched him.  Why punch him?  Ah, they're used to that down there, domestic.  Absolutely.  He always tells fat jokes about me.  Why?  You're a rail.  You're skinny.  You are, like...  That's why they're funny.  Wait, why are you...  You're, like, anorexic.  Yeah.  How much do you weigh there, man?  I know it's not the right thing to do, but how much do you weigh?  115.  You're very light.  How tall are you?  5'3".  Yeah, you're a little fat.  Oh, oh.  I took her out dancing last night.  The band skipped. 
[03:25:30]  Ooh, new one.  The band skipped.  He did not.  I want to know why Fred McMurray from the K-Mutiny is always criticizing your weight.  Wow.  That was a good one.  The band skipped.  All right.  You're on the escalator.  It stopped.  You could smell the rubber burning.  We had to walk the rest of the way up.  Do you really think he's fat?  No.  Okay.  No.  Roland, continue with your interview.  Have you seen any attractions in New York that you enjoyed? 
[03:26:00]  Any attractions?  Yes, we've enjoyed all of them.  We've seen everything.  We enjoyed it a lot.  Roland.  Roland.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Ask him what kind of work he does.  What do you do in Georgia?  I sell operating room equipment.  I got a ghoul.  Yeah.  It's a male nurse who smells like fucking pillows with handles on them.  Yes.  From the Angel of Death collection. 
[03:26:30]  That's right.  Here's the shoe askew.  It puts an orthopedic shoe back on when they try to kick it off.  Roland, they've been married 30 years.  That's quite an accomplishment.  Why don't you ask about their marriage, maybe?  Did you get married in Georgia?  Yes, we did.  We got married in Georgia at a Justice of the Peace on New Year's Eve.  What did you do for your 25th anniversary? 
[03:27:00]  For 25th?  I don't remember.  Uh-oh.  I think maybe we went diving in Jamaica and I gave her a ring under the ocean.  Maybe.  Ask about the 17th.  No, that was actually 15th.  Oh, see, that was poor.  Yeah.  One of those, I gave her a wedding.  I got confused.  We never really had a wedding, so I surprised her with a wedding.  That was a lot of fun.  You have kids?  We have one beautiful daughter, 22 years old, who lives in Nashville, works for Dale.  Beautiful.  She works for Dale?  Dale.  Well, she's American.  She doesn't do customer service.  No.  That shitbox company. 
[03:27:30]  Like the fucking firebomb, that place.  That cunt fucking laptop they sent me.  300 pound fucking non-working piece of shit laptop.  That wasn't her.  No, that wasn't her.  Fucking assholes.  No, I'm sure it wasn't.  I'm sure it wasn't her.  I'm sure it wasn't her.  But they fucking, I had to pay for my own shipping back because they hated me.  Why would you pay for your own shipping back?  I had to because I was threatening to break it on the air and they offered to pay my shipping  and then I got angry and they rescinded their offer.  And they said, no, pay for it.  Wow, they're playing hardball with you. 
[03:28:00]  Oh, they are.  Motherfucker Michael Dell's number.  I'm going to call him fucking awful company.  All right.  Right to the top.  Roland, continue.  How long are you in the city for?  We're leaving today, as a matter of fact.  Aw.  Unless Jimmy lets me stay with him.  You flying back home?  Yeah.  I'm going to guess.  Don't tell me the airline.  I think I know it.  Hold on.  Cheap.  No, Delta.  No.  No, it's cheap, cheap.  Spirit.  JetBlue.  Oh, JetBlue's nice.  Yeah, it's nice.  They have that other one that they painted over the planes of the one that crashed. 
[03:28:30]  It's the hub down there.  Oh, AirTran.  U.S. AirTran.  AirTran.  Oh, AirTran.  Delta does everything.  It used to be valued at it, yeah.  It's great.  I love it.  They got the radios with the pictures on them right in the back seat.  I think it's called a TV.  TV.  A radio with pictures.  We got a TV down there.  Do you?  Yeah.  It's black and white.  Yeah.  Well, I figured a small town, what do you got?  Like, probably satellite.  They don't run cables out there, right?  That's correct.  Yeah.  Yeah.  What was the best thing you saw in New York? 
[03:29:00]  Little Jimmy.  Really?  Yeah.  That's why I came.  Would you like to see his penis?  I was thinking like Empire State Building or something.  Sure.  I can't show my penis.  No.  I can't show my penis.  Like that.  Hey, wife.  You want to see Jim Norton's penis?  Sure.  Oh.  All right.  Come on in.  I'm shocked.  I'm a gas.  Will you allow this, sir?  Absolutely.  That way I get to see it also.  Will you let Jimmy slap her in the face with the penis?  I don't know.  Face is a little bit much, I think.  Just a little tap. 
[03:29:30]  That's up to her.  30th anniversary to get hit with my cock.  You'll never see a 31st.  I'll let you hit me with your cock.  I love this guy.  Wow.  He's all right.  This guy really likes you.  Is he a man or a mole?  We're both.  How many years before you got the balloon nut, sir?  Uh, we're still working that direction.  Wow.  Really?  As a matter of fact, this was supposed to be the weekend, but...  30 years and you ain't fucked her in the ass.  This was supposed to be the weekend, but we had Mexican. 
[03:30:00]  You know how that goes.  Hey, oh, wow.  It's creepy.  Roland?  Yeah.  There you go.  We gave you a subject.  Now ask the lady why.  Why hasn't he fucked you in the ass yet?  Don't go there.  No, you got to continue.  This is like Barbara Walters, man.  You got to ask them tough questions and make them cry and stuff.  Go ahead.  Let me go, Georgia.  Will this happen?  What?  What?  When will this occur?  Balloon nut, as he says. 
[03:30:30]  It will never occur.  Never.  Wow.  Roland.  Would you want to do it?  Sure.  Roland, the obvious question, if she says that, is why not?  Holy shit.  That's a question I've asked in 30 years.  Yeah.  It seems an obvious question to me.  Why not?  This guy's all right.  Why not?  Why not?  You're in my fucking ass. 
[03:31:00]  No, just wait in the vagina.  I'll get it.  I'll get it.  I'll get it.  I'll get it.  I'll get it.  I'll get it.  I'll get it.  How did your asshole bleed?  Roland, get to the bottom of the issue here with her.  Why not?  Steve.  Why not?  I don't...  No.  Why not?  It just won't happen.  Why not?  Why not?  Why not? 
[03:31:30]  Why not?  Because I don't want it to.  But why?  Get the fuck out.  No.  Her ass talking.  Why not?  It would hurt.  That's terrible.  I'm sorry.  Why not?  Why not?  Why not?  He wouldn't let me do it to him.  No, no, no, no, no, no, no.  Why not?  Why not?  Why not?  Sir?  Why not?  Would you let her strap on a dildo?  Absolutely, sir. 
[03:32:00]  Grr.  Grr.  So he would take a dildo, a strap on.  No, he wouldn't.  I've asked him.  No.  What the fuck?  Nothing's wrong.  Stay in the living room.  I'll handle it.  It's never asked.  It's never been offered.  I promise you.  Yeah.  It would be...  You know, for that, I would do it.  Is he hung?  That would...  Oh, Jimmy.  Yes.  Grr.  You're a size queen?  That's not looking at me.  Yeah, good couple.  That's queen.  Yeah.  I like this couple.  She's all right.  Oh, God. 
[03:32:30]  Jimmy.  Jimmy's fixing himself now.  It's very, very long.  I respect that.  Look at Jimmy.  He's tall.  He's tall.  It's very long.  Yeah, it's cool.  In front of Jimmy's pants.  And it would hurt.  It's sticking out.  Jimmy.  Watch out.  Maybe I could just slap Jimmy with that, huh?  Jimmy, you let me slap you with my cock?  No, sir.  His is very long.  What if he just puts in the tip?  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Just the tip.  Yeah.  Like that horse did to that guy in Seattle. 
[03:33:00]  Just the tip, and then you'll ram it on home.  No.  No?  She's not hurting for her.  30 years.  30 years.  He's got a really long one, so...  It's really long, and it's...  It's too fat.  Wow.  You guys got a dinty more beef stew can.  All of America knows I have a stew can.  Nice.  That's nice.  Especially if your cum is a consistency of stew.  That's even better.  You can make a girl drink it.  That's terrible.  I'm sorry. 
[03:33:30]  Are we going to get anything else from the ass couple, or what?  They're a good couple.  Roland, anything else?  We gave you a lot of material there.  Now, come on.  Let's bring the interview home here.  All right.  Is there a tea kettle going out there?  What the fuck is that?  Are you shitting me?  Who's making tea?  Is someone making tea?  Who is that?  It's Mark.  Mark.  Are you kidding me?  He's making...  Use a microwave.  What the fuck year is this?  Does he have a tea cozy?  So let your scooter...  Oh.  Oh. 
[03:34:00]  All right.  Sorry, then.  I call tea as well.  All right, Roland.  Bring the interview home.  You got ass sex to work with, 30 years, big cock, tight vag, probably.  Well, no.  Probably not.  Well, from being a fuck by the...  It's all tight.  It doesn't matter what it is.  Yeah.  Got that fat cock.  Kegels.  What?  I do kegels.  Kegels.  Kegels.  Vaginal.  Oh, you do the vaginal muscle.  Does it work?  Yes.  Yes.  Yes.  Yes.  Yeah, yes. 
[03:34:30]  Yes.  Absolutely, yes.  Really?  Roland, why are we in a...  Everybody should be...  All women should be doing kegels.  It'll prevent an operation later in their life also.  Yes.  An operation for a broken jaw when you hit her.  She's got a fucking pussy loose.  Maya.  Later in life, a woman's vagina, the rectum and the bladder falls out of her vagina.  And if you do kegels during your early life, it'll prevent that from happening.  That's great.  Wow.  Asshole falls out like a baboon lifting something. 
[03:35:00]  Yeah.  A fucking baboon lifting a fridge or E-rock.  Poor E-rock.  I'm going to suggest to me we rename him E-roll.  E-roll.  E-roll.  Oh, is that good?  I can't take credit.  Oh, you've got to give the guy credit for that one.  I have to go way back on the instant feedback.  I'll find the guy.  Fucking...  My girlfriend does...  I don't know if she does kegel, but she has that thing with us.  Snap man for Wackbag.  Snap man.  Don't fucking grip your cock.  It's fucking great, man.  My girlfriend's vagina, she hates when I talk about our sex life, but her pussy reminds 
[03:35:30]  me...  It reminds me of a lamb's mouth suckling because the lips just go out and grab.  Holy shit.  When I say that in a loving way, I can almost hear it going, meh, meh, meh.  I told her once, I said, you're pussy, it's like a horse eating oats.  Wow.  All right. 
[03:36:00]  Anything else we're going to get out of this couple?  Big cock and no ass sex?  Roland?  What's your favorite sexual positions?  Oh, there you go.  I like all of them.  Obviously, not the ass sex one, but I would like that one, but I like all of them.  Doggy.  Wow.  She likes the doggy.  That's right.  Get your hair pulled a little bit.  Spanking.  Yeah.  A little spanking.  What was that noise?  Ask them what the craziest thing they've done there. 
[03:36:30]  What was the craziest thing he's done in this bed?  Sexually.  Oh, jeez.  I don't know.  Oh, she leaned toward the microphone.  Yes, she did.  30 years.  It's got to be something.  Come on.  What in that pond?  That alligator pond?  A long time ago?  Jesus.  They fucked Steve Irwin's corpse.  The alligator...  What?  I don't remember the alligator.  He got out in the woods, and you said there were alligators out there, and we were swimming 
[03:37:00]  in the pond.  It was his cock.  Thank you.  No, an alligator bit his cock and broke its jaw.  You guys had sex in an alligator pond?  Yeah, I guess.  We have it, like, at the river a lot.  I go to the river a lot.  The river.  Why would you want to go to the river?  I fish a lot.  With his cock.  It's funny.  You're trying to fucking...  And nigger Jim steals your radio? 
[03:37:30]  Danny from Northern California.  Hmm.  Did the guest just say, when you get older, your asshole falls out of your vagina?  And your uterus, and your bladder falls out?  Your bladder and your asshole, it's called rectocele and cistocele.  It's like, they protrude into your vagina and then fall out the front of it.  Yeah.  Wow.  It's not pretty.  So what do you do?  At 30 years old, you start walking on your hands?  You kind of...  Well, they have operationally. 
[03:38:00]  They'll cut the bottom and the top out of your vagina and then sew it back tighter and  it keeps them up in there.  Or you could do the...  Kegels.  Kegels.  Or Kegels.  Kegels.  The bladder caving your pussy in.  That's fucking awful.  What's a fucking vag wall made out of fucking, like, onion paper?  How does a human body collapse like that?  Oh, honey, you got to clean out the gutters.  My cunt is caving in.  Fucking women have it rough, man.  I do not envy women at all. 
[03:38:30]  Guys only, you know, get Turkish taffy bag.  Yeah, exactly.  It goes down to your fucking kneecaps.  We have prostate cancer.  We're dead in two weeks.  Yeah, that's it.  Hey, don't have to worry about it.  Listeners are picking up on something.  When you said alligator pond, he had no clue what you were talking about.  So the listeners are assuming that you might have had sex with somebody else in the alligator pond.  Uh-oh.  We're not going to make sure he won, it looks like.  No, it was him.  He was probably too drunk to remember.  Ah, you like, name your poison there, my friend. 
[03:39:00]  Well, my poison used to be alcohol.  Well, I know.  I know I gave that one up.  The whole thing is what type.  What year did you give it up?  Oh, boy.  Maybe 10, 12 years ago.  Oh, yeah?  Yeah.  All right, hold on.  We got a question from the audience here.  All right.  Or something, an observation.  Casper, what's up?  Hey, it sounds like this guy could go noodling down at the river down there.  Yeah.  With my penis.  He goes noodling with his cock.  No, the catfish all recognize it by now.  It's a waste of time.  Don't do it.  He just likes it.  Yeah, exactly. 
[03:39:30]  Just gnaw on it a little bit.  Humor the guy.  Do you ever have a threesome?  No, but with you, I think I could talk her into it.  Wow.  Wow.  This guy likes you a lot.  I'd be intimidated by his fucking hog.  Big cock comes out.  Yeah.  Like Sam Slade.  His cock would have like a hat on, smoking a cigarette, watching me suspiciously.  Watching with one eye open.  All right.  Wow.  Wow.  They're an interesting little couple. 
[03:40:00]  I think there's more to this couple.  Oh, yeah.  I don't want to give up on them yet.  There's some kind of fucking serial killer stories.  Yeah.  What's the wildest thing we ever did?  We picked up a teen girl and chopped her up and fucked her head.  Okay.  All right.  I guess you're going to do that.  Roland, anything else to finish off the interview?  I can't help it.  All right. 
[03:40:30]  That was good.  All right.  I guess that's it for this.  Can we ask Roland a question?  Oh, yeah.  We might finally get a question from the couple married 30 years from Georgia.  Stick your mic in his face.  Is your cock bigger than that mic?  Ask her, I guess.  Yeah, ask her.  It's about that long.  But not as big as that.  His cock is as long as that microphone?  Wow.  Is that possible?  Not as big as round, but about that long.  She's not kidding.  She's not being ironic. 
[03:41:00]  No.  Holy shit.  He's got a baseball bat.  He's a tall guy.  What the hell tall are you?  Like 6'3"?  6'5".  Oh, Jesus.  6'5".  Are you really that?  Oh, okay.  Anything under 10 inches is laughable in his life.  Yeah.  You better have a big cock.  All right.  Oh, yeah.  You've got a question for Roland.  Let's go.  Why did you choose radio?  Certainly don't sound like it should be.  I didn't.  I just book guests.  I don't talk on radio.  I book guests?  At this point, we don't even know what he does. 
[03:41:30]  Okay.  That's it?  That was my only question for Roland.  All right.  There you go.  Roland, getting to know the audience.  Wonderful couple.  Congratulations.  30 years.  There's one guy Roland didn't talk to who was a little hurt.  You want Roland to talk to?  Okay.  He's a little shy, this kid.  Oh.  One more.  Roland.  What's your name?  Pat from Long Island.  What are you doing in the city?  We're actually going to a mastering house around the corner.  A what?  A mastering house.  I'm in a band. 
[03:42:00]  Actually, I had a meeting with your brother a few weeks ago.  Why is he talking like he just burned his mouth on hot coffee?  Because I actually have a busted lip.  Oh, you do?  Yeah.  What happened?  From what?  Smacked myself in the mouth with a microphone the other night.  Amongst other things.  Wait.  I shouldn't have said that.  Are you going to be the new Bono in Joe's band?  No.  I think you guys have trained me well enough to hate him with a passion.  Oh, Joe?  No, no.  Bono.  No.  Joe's actually really cool.  I actually dropped him an email.  Joe's great.  Yeah.  He was cool.  And you've answered a few of my emails. 
[03:42:30]  And were really cool to me.  Okay.  He got me hooked on you guys when I was like 15 years old.  So I could never come to any of the appearances.  I actually came to the roast.  I was one of the only ones I got to go to.  I got kicked out of the Viper Bar because I was too young.  How old are you now?  20.  All right.  Cool, man.  So this is like the first time I actually got to check you guys out and not get kicked  out.  What's the band?  Hijinks from Long Island.  Hijinks from Long Island?  Yeah.  You got like a CD on you?  Not on me.  No.  We're actually doing it.  Oh, was that a bad move?  What a dummy.  Oh, I know what you did.  The guy smacked.  So I figured I'd, you know, I don't want to. 
[03:43:00]  Should have had something.  We would play something right now.  Coming up here.  You would have had your band being played.  And I see you're going to come back another day.  And we're going to go, nah.  You're going to be like, no.  If I can't get to you, sorry.  He's going to get smashed on the table.  Yeah.  Let's have some hijinks.  We need a little hijinks for you.  Wow.  That's why we're changing the name.  It's terrible.  That's not a good name.  It's terrible.  Yeah, what are you doing?  Let's go see hijinks.  Hijinks.  Call it shenanigans.  We had one interview that actually said, if you get past the goofy name, they're a great  band.  Cool.  So I think that's when we finally realized, all right. 
[03:43:30]  And the lead singer, Thomas Foolery.  What does the band sound like?  That's a very popular question.  That's kind of Rune 5 with horns.  Rune 5 with horns.  Yeah, kind of with the Dave Matthews guitar stuff.  No emo shit, right?  Dude, that's why I can.  I mean, I remember you talking about CBG.  Because every time I do booking work, I always listen to you guys.  I'm actually like a year and a half behind because I listen to it on the internet.  Jesus Christ.  Yeah, I listen all four hours.  I don't skip anything.  But he was talking about all the dive bars on Long Island. 
[03:44:00]  It was funny.  Just as I'm like, one of the bars I was going to book at, you were bashing.  And I forgot which one.  Boring.  I lose.  So yeah, that's about all I got.  Do you have a MySpace account?  How do we hear hijinks?  Either Sonic...  New stuff is up on sonicbids.com slash H-Y-J-I-N-X-3.  Oh, good fucking luck.  You won't get one hit.  You're going to run home all excited.  MySpace.com slash hijinks. 
[03:44:30]  But that has all the old shit that's terrible.  So that's why I'm...  Get to MySpace.com slash hijinks.  And get some hijinks.  Get that terrible shit.  We'll end the show with some hijinks.  How do we find it again?  I would go to the SonicBids account.  It's got the...  All right.  What is that account again?  SonicBids.com.  Bids.com.  Okay.  Slash H-Y-J-I-N-X-3.  Oh.  You know what?  I even tried to concentrate that time.  There's a Y, a J, and an X in it.  I know.  It's like hijinks.  No, this time I'm going to try to write it down. 
[03:45:00]  Say it again.  SonicBids.  SonicBids.com.  Go ahead.  Slash H-Y-J-I-N-X-dot-org.  I don't like anything.  What happened to the three part?  Do I suck that?  Okay, I'm going to write it down.  What happened to the three?  Oh, I said three, didn't I?  Oh, forget it.  This is pressure.  How could you have .com and then slash something org?  Because it's our electronic press kit, and it has all the newish...  You idiot.  What?  You said hijinks... 
[03:45:30]  You said hijinks three, and then hijinks dot org.  You just fucked up.  See, I'm writing it down for Steve.  But you're telling him to go to a .com site slash something dot org.  Yes.  There you go.  That won't work.  Our Bud Dwyer.  Someone's saying it's Maroon 5, but gayer.  Are you the singer?  No, I play...  He plays the...  Bone.  Axophone.  He plays the...  Hold on, get rolling a better microphone.  His mic's battery's crapping up. 
[03:46:00]  Roland thought that was just his brain.  No.  He hears that all the time.  No, Roland, that was going out on the air.  That was not inside the brain.  He plays a saxophone.  What an odd instrument for a young man to play.  Hold on, we got it.  Roll it here.  Roll it here.  Oh, that works.  All that, Steve.  Yeah.  Yeah, so that's...  I play sax.  Yeah, all those type of instruments are making their way into music now.  Yeah.  Power horns.  All that stuff.  Meh.  All right.  Actually, George Marshall said hi, by the way.  I don't know if you guys remember him from...  George Marshall, man.  I'm actually a friend with Thorogood. 
[03:46:30]  I was friends with Thorogood.  Yeah, he...  Okay.  I told him...  We were doing our record there, and we were shooting his shit, because I wear your shirt  all the time.  Yeah.  And he's like, how are those guys?  Yeah.  And I was like, you know, George with his ponytail and...  Oh, yeah.  He still has that.  He smokes like half a pack of cigarettes.  Yeah, of course.  He's got a mole on his hand.  Oh, yeah.  And you can never draw your attention away from it.  No, no.  It's all...  Yeah.  Every time you shake the hand, you see the mole, ugh.  You have any clue what he's talking about?  No.  And why did Nolan...  When he said, I'm friends with George Marshall, and I said, I'm friends with Thorogood. 
[03:47:00]  No, you got it, but he didn't.  He was like, oh, yeah, no, I know.  Yeah.  He's a good boy.  All right, guys.  Thank you.  He's 20.  Yeah.  Thanks for doing...  Getting to know the audience.  What?  Iraq is actually old friends with my bassist.  He went to high school with them, and they almost burned the school down.  Iraq almost burned the school down?  Why?  Was Eric's knife and fork rubbing together?  It's just new. 
[03:47:30]  Some kind of relationship with this gentleman?  It's George McRedmond.  Oh, shit.  All right.  Hold on.  I just dumped.  No last names.  No last names.  Oh, I'm sorry.  Especially when accusations of arson are in the...  Do you have to hit the dump button?  By the way, yes.  Probably didn't work anyway.  Dave writes, yes, Opie, the saxophone is just now being introduced to music.  It's coming back into current music.  It was very popular during the ska and funk period in the early to mid-90s. 
[03:48:00]  Billy Joel used it a lot.  He's actually a friend of ours.  But now it's...  Billy Joel?  The sax player.  We recorded it in his studio last.  What's his name?  This guy knows everybody.  Richie Kanata?  Yeah, Richie.  Yeah.  We did his studio.  No one gives a shit about him.  Kanata, Kanata, Kanata play Zagzavon.  Richie Kanata.  Excuse me.  What happened here?  We just missed.  You really got something going on with that chin.  Is it really?  Oh.  What are you going to do?  You have to do something. 
[03:48:30]  Chin exercises?  He's chewing food to try to lose the weight in his chin.  Let's send him to Iraq and see if they can get a noose around that neck.  Good luck.  What happened?  I don't know.  I was sick over the holiday.  I just sat around and ate.  Can you do Chubby Bunny for us today?  All right.  What are you going to do, though?  Exercise?  What's the New Year's resolution?  No New Year's resolution.  Obviously, from today, I'm going to lose some of this weight.  Well, you don't look that bad. 
[03:49:00]  I mean, I'm not even fucking with you.  You put a couple pounds.  I'm not saying you were obese, dude.  Open your screen.  How much did you put on, would you say?  Maybe about another 10.  That's 15.  I was going to say 15.  Since when?  Since yesterday?  Since probably middle of December.  What?  Is that possible?  It's just like the first week of January.  I know.  That's what I'm saying.  It's like a pound a day, almost.  Today was banana yogurt and Cheerios. 
[03:49:30]  Sam comes in and points and laughs at him.  Sam's happy.  Oh, we got some hijinks.  You're off the hook.  We got to play some higher.  What's this song called, sir?  They want to call you E-Roll now.  See you around.  I just mean that's the way you're shit.  They didn't tell me which one it was.  It's Heartbreaker.  Led Zeppelin.  Cool.  No.  Thanks for giving me the time to come up with the line. 
[03:50:00]  Nah, we don't like that.  You've got to give a little more than that.  What?  At least to the chorus.  The horn playing was shit.  What?  Yeah, I like things for the horn playing.  Yeah, they've got to get rid of that sax player.  Exactly.  It's very distracting, that sax.  Sounds like someone's bladder fucking blowing their vag out.  Thanks for giving me the time to come up with the line.  Because you know I'm all about feeling, showing you a good time.  And I know that I'm not the only one in sight. 
[03:50:30]  Who suddenly stops breathing whenever you walk by.  And you know if heart-breaking, heart-breaking was a crime.  You'd have been locked up long ago and you'd never be mine.  But now you've got all these other guys.  They're just watching your eyes.  And you know it feels like, it feels like, it feels like, it feels like, it feels like,  you're never going to leave mine.  Then it feels like, it feels like, it feels like, it feels like, it feels like that you are, you know it. 
[03:51:00]  With all of that beauty  Common becomes pride  But you're not about that  You know what you said  What if heartbreaking, heartbreaking was a crime  You'd have been locked up long ago 
[03:51:30]  And you'd never be mine  But now you got all these other guys  They're just watching your eyes  You know it feels like, it feels like, it feels like, it feels like  You're never gonna leave my eyes  You're never gonna leave my eyes  You're never gonna leave my eyes  And you know everything 
[03:52:00]  Thinks they need you  To survive  To stay alive  And you know every man here  Wants to meet you  Before tonight  And never say goodbye  If heartbreaking was a crime 
[03:52:30]  You'd have been locked up long ago  And you'd never be mine  But now you got all these other guys  Just watching your eyes  You know it feels like, it feels like, it feels like, it feels like, it feels like  You're never gonna leave my eyes  There it is. Hi, Jinx. What do you guys think out there, huh? 
[03:53:00]  Uh-oh. George is applauding.  Yeah. It's not my style, but I'm a movie, but they're not a bad band. I mean, they're a good band.  I think the singer's very good  He's got a really cool voice  I like the drums, too  Uh, yeah, very good drummer  Uh, I like the horns, they sound good, too  Thanks  To give you a little prop there  It's, uh, yeah, Maroon 5  Yeah, that record changed our entire life  Like, we used to be a shitty ska band  And then that record came out  And we kind of all really got into it, so 
[03:53:30]  All kind of ripped off  Uh, yeah, basically  Well, John Mayer was on your show  And he said the best quote that I'll  That I think I've ever heard was  At this point in the game  No one does anything original  It's how good you can rip something off  I saw that on, uh, live feed  And it was probably  Why not?  You know, why not?  Why not?  No, that was pretty good  But let me tell you, uh, the Pal Talk reviews that were coming in  Those motherfuckers  They're gonna trash anything  They don't like anything  They're gonna trash anything  They're just calling it Faggle Rock  Is one review  Uh, sucks 
[03:54:00]  Puke and shit  Like, they don't even  It's not even, like, reviews  Like, it's just random  Bad words being thrown out  So what did you think?  Uh, Jiggaboo come, alright?  Right  Whatever that means  A lot of people are pissed off  Because they really wanted to  Wanted it to suck  But it didn't  Yeah  No, it was coming in a lot  Like G-Baby from, uh, FBA  Uh, FullBlownAids.com  God, I wish this sucked  But it doesn't  Look, pull some fucking bands that suck  And play that  You've heard a multitude of bands 
[03:54:30]  That really fucking suck  That wasn't bad at all  That really sounded good  You know, talented bunch of guys  Thanks for playing  You got some  Your kid's got some talent  Were you ever in a band, Sam?  Yeah  Good  We're actually supposed to do some shows  But Brother Joe wants  We actually sit down  He wants us to do some opening stuff  But, uh, something happened  At one of the venues  That he was playing  They double booked  And he kind of was, uh  Wasn't in the mood to talk for the night  He was kind of a little pissed  That's Joe  That's Joe  Yeah, that's Joe  But at least he was cool  And said, listen, tonight might not be a cool night  I'm kind of, uh 
[03:55:00]  Things are crazy over here  So it was cool of him to do that  Yeah, Joe's changing  He's probably firing half the band  Or getting in fights with them  Or something  God knows what he was doing  I'm surprised  At that point  I knew Bono lasted two weeks so far  Jesus  How many Bonos have he been  I don't know  Has he been through?  Joe's actually trying to get, uh  Bono's blood  So he can clone him  He actually fired the real Bono  At one point  Imagine that  If he realized three Bonos back  Was the real Bono  Fuck  Joe wants to be both  He wants to be Edge and Bono 
[03:55:30]  And just maybe have different hats  Just do it  Put the drum kit on his back  Put the cymbals between his knees  Alright, the big website plug again  www.hyginx.org  Alright  Hijinx.org  With that we gotta take a break  Oh, we gotta end Roland's interviews  With the audience  With the Roland theme song once more  As we go to break here  Are we gonna get to the story of the day?

[04:01:00]  so  we got the monkey  here it is  the European Anthony  oh, you got the letter?  and Jimmy  it is our pleasure  to inform you  that a donation  was made  on your behalf  by  a certain someone  to the Jane Goodall Institute  on December  blah blah blah  for the chimp  guardianship program  congratulations  you are now  a chimp guardian  for  Baluku  Baluku 
[04:01:30]  Baluku  Baluku  B-A-L  Baluku  U-K-U  in close  you will find information  on chimpanzees  the Jane Goodall Institute  as well as  a short biography  a picture  and your chimp  guardian certificate  for  Baluku  our little chimp  he's so cute  he is  adorable  I want that picture  the color picture  what?  I said color picture  scanned  into the computer  so we can put 
[04:02:00]  the color picture  up  on the  message boards  alright  it's  ador-  look at the little guy  let me see him  he is a  Baluku  how do you not want to  just look at his little ears  I want to give him a kiss  I want to make two  ashtrays  out of those little hands  no  yes  he is adorable  I'd pick him up  by his little feet  and throw him  into a wood chipper  with your  generous  investment  the Jane Goodall Institute  will continue to care 
[04:02:30]  for the chimpanzees  who live in our  sanctuaries  in the Republic of  Congo  and Uganda  oh boy  and in the wild  at Gombe  on behalf of  all the dedicated  people who work  with us  an important cause  and particularly  on behalf of  the orphaned  and wild chimps  in need  please accept  our warmest thanks  thank you  sincerely  and etc  etc  look at how cute  the picture of  Baluku  and he has  like  he's like  next to like  a little cage 
[04:03:00]  he's holding  like a little  green thing  his little fingers  he's adorable  here's the story  of Baluku  you would kiss him  you would kiss him  Baluku  in the summer of 99  the Ugandan Wildlife Agency  with the aid of  customs officials  confiscated a young male chimp  from the  border in Uganda.  This poor little chimp had been locked up  in a coal shed  without light or food.  A little chimp.  That's terrific.  No, it's not.  That's terrific. 
[04:03:30]  While his captor waited for a buyer,  probably from the international pet trade.  Where is that?  The chimp was brought to  Nambagaba Island Sanctuary  and a 100-acre island  located in Lake Victoria, Uganda.  The island supports a rich diversity  of wildlife.  That's wonderful.  The staff first met Baluku.  It was obvious to them  he had been abused around his waist.  He had a deep scar  from where the ropes had been tied. 
[04:04:00]  Understandably,  he was apprehensive around humans.  Although it was a slow process,  Baluku is now much more comfortable  around people.  I say we go and bring him a cake.  Worked out well for the last guy  that tried that.  Baluku will rip our balls off  and eat our feet.  Baluku is a bad boy  and that's why that gentleman  was tying him up.  No!  He's a bad chimp.  Since his arrival,  Baluku has grown into  quite a boisterous juvenile.  He's a very spirited  and mischievous young male. 
[04:04:30]  Ever popular with the staff  and visitors alike,  he now feels very much at home  with his chimpanzee companions,  all of whom were,  like Baluku,  rescued from an uncertain fate.  He loves the water.  He enjoys sitting and playing in the lake  when the water's calm and clear.  He recently joined up with another chimp  named Indy,  and together they retrieved  an old jerry can.  Took out of the lake.  Can't you say gas can?  They forgot other things he enjoys.  Jerry can is from World War II.  It was kind of a term for the Germans 
[04:05:00]  were the jerrys,  and they carry the gas in jerry cans.  By the way,  he doesn't just enjoy playing in the lake.  He also enjoys testicle biting  and shit throwing.  And they attempted to float on it.  They play together.  They have a behavioral enrichment program,  and they have an artificial termite mound,  and they've been instructed  on how to use the stick  to see where the money goes.  That's just terrific.  They teach him to use a stick 
[04:05:30]  to get the termites.  Recently, Baluku showed us  the new side to his personality.  When him and four of his friends  tried to rob a man on the subway.  No.  Stop it.  We're introduced into a nursery group,  and rather than teasing them mercilessly,  he took it upon himself  to be their protector.  So he's turning into a good little chimp  with our help now,  thanks to the people  that Roland works with.  And by the way,  we're not the only ones  that have adopted a chimp. 
[04:06:00]  Really?  Yeah.  Hold on.  Let's see.  I am going to hit  the goddamn dump button  because it's a slow news day.  What?  I thought this is the only proof  of adoption or caretaking financially  of a chimpanzee that I have seen  or heard from anybody that we know.  Oh, yeah.  So I can only assume  if you know somebody else,  there's going to be something horrible.  Wait a minute. 
[04:06:30]  Anthony Cumia  is backing away from the microphone.  Well, I'm just saying,  you know,  ask that problem, Ron.  Oh, what?  Ron?  From the Ron and Pez show?  They're also in the adoption program.  I'd ask him if I was  on speaking terms with him  or anyone from that show.  No, it's really just Ron  at this point.  Yeah, but Ron is the titular head  of that program.  And I don't even want to get into it,  but big problems. 
[04:07:00]  Big problems.  And yes,  it does involve the whole  Free FM thing  and I'm going over there.  And they are part  of the adoption program.  They are?  Yes.  By the way,  how's Brad?  I hear theirs  keeps fainting.  That's what I hear  when you discuss broken penises.  They got theirs  from the Opie and Anthony Institute.  They're going to go with  Brad and Angelina.  No, no, no.  No, no.  That's been played out  a little bit.  No, no, no. 
[04:07:30]  Absolutely.  That was a donation  that was made  to the Muni Foundation,  the Scott Muni Foundation  for adopting their chimp.  That's wonderful.  $5,000 to the person  that brings me  Baluku's head.  No.  He's adorable.  Where's his little picture?  Can I see his little picture, Jimmy?  I just want to box  O Chimp head. 
[04:08:00]  I want to whip his back  with a cord.  No.  Let me see his little...  Oh, I thought Sam  was coming to get it.  You put it back  like the fucking  Pony Express  was coming for it.  So our Christmas present  is that we adopted a chimp.  Is the peace of mind  that we are now caring  for this young little chimpanzee.  Let me show the pal talk people.  Look.  Look how adorable he is.  I can't wait to see  the photoshops. 
[04:08:30]  Opie and Anthony  adopt a chimp.  They won't be doing anything  with that on the message board.  No.  Somehow I feel  our adopted chimp  will be waist deep  in water  carrying Heineken bottles.  There he is.  Isn't he adorable?  See?  The girls are all  just cooing over him.  All right.  Bring the picture home.  It doesn't look like me.  Shut up.  Give the picture to the boys 
[04:09:00]  so they can get it up on  openanthony.com.  And get that up online  because an adorable  little chimp like that  deserves all the exposure  he can get.  Yeah.  Does he?  Here you can scan the  certificate of authenticity.  Frame that.  Put that up.  That's a nice thing.  I want to know how much  it was to do  because I'll do that  on my own too.  Boy.  Boy, next year  are we going to adopt  a star?  Well, I want to name  a star.  Name a star.  I want to name a star  after my gal. 
[04:09:30]  Do you?  Yes.  Look at that star.  No, no, no.  Not that one.  Yes, that one.  Toothy head.  What is wrong with you?  What?  Did you ever buy a star  for anybody?  You've never done that?  No.  No.  Maybe.  Maybe.  When you were younger.  Did you?  How much is it?  I don't know.  I think it was  a hundred and up.  A hundred up?  What's the difference?  A better star?  The big one is the sun.  The sun. 
[04:10:00]  A billion dollars.  It'll cost you.  I actually tried to  change the name of the sun  to cunt meat  and then I didn't have  enough cash.  All right.  Where's the line of the day?  Line of the day.  Two runners up.  Really?  Yeah.  Hi there.  Roland, who sponsors  line of the day?  Bowdog?  Balooku.  Balooku.  What's the name of our chimp?  Balooku?  Balooku?  Baloon. 
[04:10:30]  Balooku.  Yeah.  Balooku.  Bowdogfight.com?  Yeah.  Hey, what happened  when we were getting  Mikey the chimp in here?  Will he try it or what?  He sucks.  No, he's cute.  He's a little fucker.  That Mikey.  Mike's a bad boy.  Balooku could beat  the shit out of him.  I bet.  Mikey would smash that  faggot.  Woody?  Without a doubt.  Chimp fights.  Let's do chimp fights.  Come on.  Let's get two chimps in here  to beat the living fuck  out of each other.  Do you want to  overschedule him?  I want to make a demand  that we want Balooku 
[04:11:00]  in studio.  Try again.  Yeah.  Let's fly him in.  That's how we'll give him  good promotion.  I've worked with him before.  You've worked with him before.  You know what?  I've worked with him.  Mikey?  Did you tell them that?  No.  I want to see Mikey the Chimp.  Hold on.  Roland, I did a pilot  with him for MTV.  Mikey the Chimp.  Tell them Jim Norton.  I did a pilot with him  called The Biggest Loser  for MTV in upstate New York.  She might remember me.  I got along very well  with him.  I had photos with him. 
[04:11:30]  That's why I wanted  to get him in here.  Yeah, I loved him.  She said he took to me  very fast.  All right, let's get him in.  He was hugging me.  All right, line on the line.  Sitting in my lap.  Called Filthy Animal  and the Chimpanzee Show.  He was so cute.  He held my hand.  Mikey grabbed my hand.  What you got to do  is you got to sit a chimp  on your foot  and you bounce your foot  up and down  and just give him a ride.  That's what they like.  Do they?  Yeah, they do.  And then he grabbed my hand  and he walked me  all around the compound.  And he wouldn't leave. 
[04:12:00]  They actually made me leave the set  so we could film  with other people  because every time I was there  he would just...  He was in love  with little Jimmy.  Yeah.  Aww.  Hey, Roland,  could you do an E-Rock scream  before we do Line of the Day?  I'll try.  You know the E-Rock scream?  Well, why don't we get...  Why don't we get E-Roll in here?  E-Roll.  God damn, I love that.  That's E-Roll.  E-Roll.  E-Rock.  E-Jelly Roll.  E-Rock.  This is the E-Rock scream.  It's a classic. 
[04:12:30]  Are you geared up for one?  Do you think you can get  an E-Rock scream out of you?  You got enough energy in you?  I mean, we have one here.  Just pretend all the cake frosting  is gone.  He's going to turn out  to be anorexic.  You watch.  All right.  E-Rock, back off.  This is the E-Rock scream. 
[04:13:00]  I love that one.  Roland, you think you could do this?  Yeah.  Okay.  It's so lackluster.  His hand is going like...  You have to really yell  as long as you can.  Yeah, that's the example.  But basically,  it's you yelling  as long as you can.  And even when you're starting  to run out of air,  keep it going.  It's got to be loud.  You can't do it anymore.  Like, yeah.  Scream.  The hands. 
[04:13:30]  What the fuck was that being?  Like he's talking.  Goddamn.  Collection.  All right.  Here's the first runner-up  line of the day.  That's great.  Wow.  Asshole falls out  like a baboon  lifting something. 
[04:14:00]  Fucking baboon  lifting a fridge  or E-Rock.  Poor E-Rock.  Someone's suggesting  we rename him E-Roll.  E-Roll.  E-Roll.  Oh, is that good?  Wow, who got it?  E-Roll.  E-Roll from Alyssa?  Yeah, Snapman, I think.  Snapman from Wagbag.  Hey, Snapman.  Very good.  All right.  Bodogfight.com.  Here is the second  runner-up line of the day. 
[04:14:30]  It's a montage  of all his  insults.  Montage!  Ah!  Oh.  You're stealing E-Roll's bit.  Well, he was running out the door  and I thought someone had it.  E-Roll's not running anywhere.  Stop it.  Now, that fat  holiday stomach.  Jimmy,  Jimmy asked E-Roll,  did you get fatter  for the holidays?  Would you have a  throw pillow sandwich?  It's so uncomfortable  with him sitting  right next to me.  Not really. 
[04:15:00]  Sam's enjoying it.  Oh.  Sam revels in this.  Of course he is.  Wiry, red-cheeked,  happy Sam.  All svelte.  Ready to wear  European cut trousers.  Not an ounce  of body fat on him.  Not an ounce of it.  Except on his cheeks.  Absolutely.  Just the perfect amount  to pinch.  Absolutely.  Look at that.  His cheeks  always look  freshly pinched.  Sweet boy  with cheeks  for fresh pinching. 
[04:15:30]  He has a little  roadside stand.  Pinch my cheeks  for a nickel, madam.  He looks like a marionette.  Is it time  for line of the day?  BoneDogFight.com  Here it is.  Here  comes  line of the day  line of the day  line of the day  line of the day  line of the day 
[04:16:00]  Oh, can you get  the E-Rock  in here for a sec?  I don't know.  Can you?  Get him through that door.  Hey, Monty Python  movie ending.  Roll for me.  You forgot an A  and a T  on your shirt.  3FM sweatshirt  which is just  the F logo.  That's good.  I'm teasing.  Wow.  The E-Rock 
[04:16:30]  trifecta.  Oh, wait a second.  Oh, the sit-up.  Sorry.  Is that the line  of the day?  No, it has to be fat.  We just  bashed E-Rock.  Yeah, it was pretty much  it was the staff  picking their favorite  lines of the day  all of which were equal  I think  because they bashed  E-Rock  every single one of them.  But it was the sit-up line  was really good.  Yeah, but I thought  F-E forget this was  an A and a T  I said, why don't you  sit down  since you won't be  doing any sit-ups  but I thought  the F-A-T line  was good.  Mine was visual.  Yeah, yours was funnier though.  Nah, I like yours better.  Hey, cut it out.  Let's just  let's meet in the middle  but none of that stomach 
[04:17:00]  it'll take all day.  I'm only kidding  you look alright.  You're portly.  I'd like some pants  please  what kind  Huskies, madam.  Huskies.  Fair enough.  Alright.  Is uh  Dirty Pants  thank you sir.  Line of the day.  Line of the day.  Line of the day. 
[04:17:30]  Here  comes  line of the day.  Line of the day.  Why not?  How'd your parents die?  Why not?  How'd your parents die?  That  that's terrible.  I'm sorry.  What's my problem?  You're in my  fucking house.  No  nothing's wrong.  Just stay in the living room.  I'll handle it.  I guarantee  when he did that  his fucking hand  waved to the left  and his eyes  looked down.  Here  act it out  as it's going on.  Let me see.  Hold on.  Here it is.  One  two  three.  No  nothing's wrong. 
[04:18:00]  Just stay in the living room.  I'll handle it.  Perfect.  Looking away.  Looks away.  Arm  in the opposite direction  where he's looking.  A little disgust.  A little  here's how  the guy  dude that's terrible.  It's just a little  byline was used.  That  that's terrible.  I'm sorry.  It tilted to the left  and my shoulders slumped.  That  that's terrible.  I'm sorry.  How'd your parents die?  By the way  dog shit sniffer  from Woodside?  Yes. 
[04:18:30]  Is that F  on E-Rock shirt  the grade he got  in health class?  Oh  come on  that's a little much.  We all put on  a little later on holidays.  We sure did.  That's what happened.  It's known.  Everybody does.  It's just a known thing.  Very careful.  Except Sam.  Of course not.  He might have put on  a little  in his cheeks.  A little rouge.  A little rouge.  I bet you  when children 
[04:19:00]  see him in the mall  they ask where Santa is  because he looks  like an elf.  Like one of  Santa's helpers.  Mama  there's a  rosy cheeks boy  who will lead us  to Santa.  Don't talk to him.  He's a boy  of indistinguishable race.  Let's say hi  to Chris of Pennsylvania.  Chris what's up?  Hey sorry to go back  to Roland Scream  but if you listen to it  you'll notice he makes  it sound like a question  somehow.  Yeah of course he does. 
[04:19:30]  And if you saw it  I mean obviously  it was videotaped  by a rosy cheek  young boy  with a camera.  With a camera.  I got it  with my camera  and his hands  were going  like Roland  he was discussing  something  as he was yelling.  I don't know  what it was.  He was speaking  chimpanzee.  Alright.  Can we go now?  Yes.  We got a meeting  to do with the boys here.  What?  Should we keep  the pal talk camera  rolling for the meeting 
[04:20:00]  today?  Can't.  Oh no.  The camera can roll  the sound cannot.  The sound cannot.  Who's being fired?  Oh.  He's in the room.  Oh boy.  Oh boy.  Alright.  That's Dan.  Being fired for that hairdo.  That's awful.  It certainly is.  Frank Van Stein.  Oh shit.  E-Rock.  Redding from Wackbag  is asking if we could  do E-Rock radio today  with a stipulation.  where you just take 
[04:20:30]  calls about how fat  you are.  Oh shit.  Can you last 15 minutes?  Do you honestly think  anyone on the staff  would be cruel enough  to put those calls through?  Yeah.  They all would.  Alright.  I'm going to explain  the obvious.  Yes they would be.  Are you crazy?  They can't stand him.  Here's the first one  from a cell phone.  It's obvious  he's given up on shirts.  Hey maybe we can call  the E-Rock showgram. 
[04:21:00]  Ooh.  15 minutes E-Rock.  What do you say?  Yeah.  I remember.  Looks like Rocky Allen.  Yeah.  15 minutes?  Oh.  Now he's had it.  Now the lines  have been crossed.  What do you think?  Can you take 15 minutes  of abuse from the listeners?  15 minutes.  About gaining 15 pounds  over the Hollywood.  15 minutes.  Of abuse.  15 minutes.  A minute per pound.  That's what you get  for licking the bull.  I bet you he just  fucking buys cookie dough  and slices it open 
[04:21:30]  and opens his mouth  and pounds it in  like it's a cock  unless it's dissolved.  Jesus Steve.  What the fuck?  Oh that was really funny.  You're supposed to  stick up for the guy.  Oh fuck him.  Oh fuck him.  You're supposed to  pull him aside and go  they're just joking.  Oh no they're not.  15 minutes.  I don't think you can do it.  Travis you better be good  on the phone.  What not eat?  15 minutes.  Sorry.  I forgot the whole  gist was false. 
[04:22:00]  Alright here.  Fuck the meeting.  I gotta sit back  and watch this.  Is there anything  important really?  Really important.  Cannot even wait  until just an email.  The room you asked for  will have a discreet  lighting in the lobby area.  I don't know what  that meant.  The lobby area.  Sorry Steve.  It's just one thing  I can't talk about.  Is everyone good  with a plane  that flies to Vegas?  Okay.  That's covered.  What do you mean  though?  Can you do the meeting?  We'll take a quick break. 
[04:22:30]  Yeah.  By the time we're back  meeting over  E-Rock in the seat  taking phone calls  for 15 minutes  from the listeners  on how fat he got  during the holiday.  Yes.  Could do that.  Alright.  Quick break though.  I need a break.  Break E-Rock Radio  when we get back.  Sorry talk about people.  You gotta wait.  And now  Reflections on James Norton  with Mr. Robert Sack.  I'd sure like to be his girl.  Walking in the park  hand in hand.  Wrapping my legs around.  Cuddling in the  spoon position.  Alright.  Little Jimmy Norton. 
[04:23:00]  Bring on  the blue blue blue  creamer.  On the O.P.  Anthony Show.  It's E-Rock Radio.  I love E-Rock.  We love E-Rock Radio.  E-Rock?  What's that?  E-Rock Radio.  Yeah, I like them.  It's hot.  It's cool.  E-Rock.  E-Rock?  E-Rock Radio.  He's evil.  He's a bad guy.  He's not true to himself  and he's just ugly  and his nose is falling off.  I don't love it.  He's an asshole.  Eric Nagel is this  bisexual, incompetent 
[04:23:30]  radio guy, believe it or not.  I don't like listening to him  and he's not really that smart.  He's where I can go  fuck himself.  The E-Rock music.  Got to set up the bid here though.  We're heading out the door  but we're doing E-Rock Radio  for 15 minutes today.  If you're just listening,  we noticed...  Jimmy, did you know...  Who had the observation?  Jimmy Norton had the observation  that E-Rock may have gained  a few LBs  during the Christmas vacation  we all had.  We were gone for what?  Two weeks? 
[04:24:00]  Something like that?  And we learned  that E-Rock gained  probably 15 pounds  in two weeks.  I thought De Niro  was going to stab him  and then wipe his hands  on his stomach.  How did that get nothing?  How did that get nothing?  You were a victim  of circumstance.  I think you were looking  at something else  and I was just reading a text.  How did that get nothing?  The show's over.  Yeah, try it again.  The show's been over.  This is extra show.  Jimmy, try it again.  This is E-Rock's show.  Try it again.  Okay, one more time.  I was saying  he's going for it again.  Yes, when I saw his stomach 
[04:24:30]  I thought De Niro  should be stabbing him  and then wiping  his hands on him.  Okay.  All right.  Antonio Anderle.  That's funny.  So this is E-Rock's punishment.  He's doing 15 minutes.  All he's doing  is taking phone calls  about how fat he got  from the listeners.  We'll see what  the listeners have  if they got what it takes.  All right.  All right.  They're gearing up.  All right.  Here they go. 
[04:25:00]  Here they go.  So I'm stepping aside,  Than, we'll host the show.  I'll sit for a couple minutes  and move along.  My truck is here.  E-Rock has a timer in his hand.  Yeah.  You ready, E-Rock?  Ready.  He's got a tire  around his waist.  All right, we haven't started yet.  Don't start the timer yet, E-Rock.  Ready?  All right.  And go.  Lady Trucker.  Lady Trucker, go ahead.  Hey, E-Rock. 
[04:25:30]  One's the baby, dude.  All right.  Well, E-Rock could comment  and stuff, too.  All right.  It wasn't funny.  Ah, nice.  Nice.  Okay.  That's smart.  Coke Logic from Weckback.  Go ahead.  Hey, I want to talk  to Lard-Ass there.  You there, Lard-Ass?  Yeah, I'm here, sir.  That was funny.  I want you to pace yourself now.  You got 15 minutes.  I don't want you running out of breath.  All right.  That's good.  Chuck from Wisconsin.  Go ahead.  Hey, guys.  I was wondering when, E-Rock, 
[04:26:00]  if when you were walking down the street,  have you ever met  a mistake for Steve Carr  from the band Foundry?  Oh, whoa.  Ah, good one.  How nice.  A little pendulum?  Yeah.  Hey, it's wasted time.  I love this one.  It's a hit.  Chris from Jersey.  Go ahead.  Hey, E-Rock,  I've heard of the freshman 15.  Is this the junior 75 you put on?  Yeah, I did.  It's been an ongoing process  since December, 
[04:26:30]  slowly gaining weight.  Nothing I could do about it.  Gary from Tennessee.  Go ahead, man.  Hey, E-Rock,  you fat blubber,  turkey lip,  fucking fat fucker,  blubber fucker.  That's right.  All right.  Okay.  Jim from Kentucky.  Go ahead.  Hey,  be a great big fat boy.  About a size 14. 
[04:27:00]  All right.  Anything, Eric?  Not on that, no.  Matt from Yonkers.  Go ahead.  Hey, when's the last time  you actually saw your dick?  This morning, sir.  It's not that bad.  Ew.  That's terrible.  I'm sorry.  How about, Eric?  Bombing as a fat soul.  When is the last time  you saw your dick?  I don't know.  The last time I looked down  at what your mother  had her mouth wrapped around.  Right.  There you go.  Not that that's a great line,  but it's a text book.  Yeah.  It's a text book.  You instantly talk about your dick. 
[04:27:30]  You talk about his mom.  Yeah.  How many minutes you got?  He went, no.  Yes, sir.  I saw it this morning.  We have 12.50 left.  Wow.  It'll get better.  All right.  Redding, go ahead, man.  Hey, Eclipse.  Hey, you're so fat, man.  I can hear you getting fatter  through the phone.  Why don't you just go away  for a while  and leave everyone alone?  Good luck, Eric.  That was hurtful, sir.  All right.  Thank you, Eric. 
[04:28:00]  Bye.  Prozac, go ahead, man.  Ah, Erock.  Can you see your pee-pee  when you go to the bathroom?  Your fat little belly hanging out?  Your fat little sweaty belly hanging out?  You do a little pee-pee  in the bathroom, huh, fat boy?  Talk to me with a twinkie  in your mouth,  little fat fuck.  I think he's hitting on me.  Can you see your pee-pee  when you go to the bathroom?  That daddy wiped that  with a baby cloth.  Huh, big boy?  Huh?  Stick a twinkie in your mouth  while you do pee-pee,  you fat fucking pig. 
[04:28:30]  I'll pour whipped cream  on your little hiney.  All right.  Thanks, Prozac.  Fat fuck, huh?  Fuck me, fat boy.  Wow.  All right, Ted,  go ahead, buddy.  Hey, E. Claire.  Why don't you have a bowl  of sugar smacks,  you fat cunt?  Hey.  You have a comment?  Erock.  Nah, I'm just taking it all in.  Okay. 
[04:29:00]  I'll leave it alone.  Hey, why don't you go  to the honeycomb hideout?  You're fat.  Okay.  Anything else?  You're not really  helping the show.  Well, what am I supposed to say?  All right, I gained some weight.  That's a start, fatso.  First step is admitting it.  Is that all you have?  You fucking, your neck, 
[04:29:30]  you look like you have the mumps.  All right, now I'm bombing too.  Bye, Ted.  Eleven minutes.  No, maybe a minute left.  This is awful.  Dan.  Hey, guys.  How's it going today?  Erock, is it true that  you're so fat now  when the boys tell you  to haul ass  you've got to make two trips?  That's a trucking joke.  Nothing?  Sorry, I didn't get it, sir. 
[04:30:00]  All right.  Crash, crash.  Later.  Later, Dan.  Yeah, I think the phones  are officially jammed.  This can't possibly be accurate.  There's plenty of feedback, though.  Erock is almost the size  of a Sirius radio.  That's good.  He should change his name  from Hawk to Hulk.  Dude, so many people  are calling,  we jammed the phone.  There's not one thing  that can't possibly be true. 
[04:30:30]  Yeah.  Equator.  Another one.  Somebody broke,  you broke the phones, Erock.  With my fatness.  Yeah.  Well, I'm sorry.  They're of varying quality.  Hey, Erock,  how many times  you've been mistaken  for Lady Di?  That's hurtful.  That's low.  This is all, uh...  Can we get a pic  of Erock's bunt? 
[04:31:00]  I don't even think  I have one.  Erock-y road.  Erock-y road.  We got a bail  because the stupid phones  are jammed.  Yeah.  Ugh.  Sorry.  All right.  I'll see how you guys  get out of this mess.  Same way you do,  just wave at Bill.  Nice!  Wow!  Looks like you sewed 
[04:31:30]  Erock's asshole shut  and he ate a Twinkie factory.  That's just hurtful.  Yeah, the phones are just  completely crapped out.  Congratulations, Erock.  You survived how many minutes?  About six minutes.  Jesus.  All right.  Any parting words, Anthony?  Oh, I'm not even supposed  to still be here.  All right.  I was just texting.  You guys are doing  like a show.  Yeah.  And I'm just, look,  I'm getting text messages  and I'm texting.  Ah, it's from Poe. 
[04:32:00]  It says,  okay.  Just to let you know.  Uh, that's about it  except also a reminder  to everybody,  Saturday, 9 p.m.,  the Than and Sam show.  Ah, look at the plug  on XM 202.  The Than and rosy-cheeked  boy show.  Oh, you golly.  See you tomorrow, guys.  The Opie and Anthony show.  Gut-busting,  ab-crunching.  Boy, how bad can he get?  Have you seen a man  eat his own head?  Yes!  Now you'll get used to it, 
[04:32:30]  Opie.  Anthony spent $300  on fags.  Ass clowns.  Anthony.  This is the freakiest show  I've ever been party to.  It should be illegal.  The Opie and Anthony show.  You guys suck!  All that talk is crazy! </pre>
