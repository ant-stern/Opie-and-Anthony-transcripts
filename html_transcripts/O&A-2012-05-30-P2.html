<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show's "After ONA Live" segment began with a post-show review dominated by Opie's repeated, hilarious mistake of calling Ice-T "Ice Cube" during their interview.  The hosts played back the audio clip multiple times, reacting with laughter to Opie's confident but incorrect pronouncements.  They then discussed Opie's attempt to salvage the situation with a strong performance during the final hour.  The conversation then shifted to Opie's upcoming wedding, focusing on his apparent lack of suitable footwear and his tendency to reuse suits.  Prank ideas for the wedding, orchestrated by the other hosts, were also discussed.

A mysterious rumor, alluded to earlier in the broadcast, was briefly mentioned, with the hosts agreeing to reveal it the following day, building anticipation.  Much of the conversation also revolved around Jim Norton (absent from the studio), his Lego Taj Mahal obsession, and his generally excitable nature. His manager, Jonathan, who had been a previous guest on the show, was mentioned in connection to Jim and also to Roland (also absent), with a crude anecdote highlighting their interaction being shared.  While Ice-T was present outside the studio, Jonathan was the only guest mentioned as being physically present.

A digression into Jim Norton's questionable musical tastes took place, mocking his car's playlist, particularly Tumani Diabate and the Chora instrument.  A segment was dedicated to playing and discussing Diabate's music. The overall tone of the segment was highly informal, characterized by crude humor, inside jokes, frequent interruptions, and a conversational, rambling style, with the "Ice Cube" gaffe serving as the central comedic point.

[00:00:00]  Sirius XR  And now, the Opie and Anthony show continues  This is After ONA Live  Here's your host, Sam Roberts  Oh yeah  You're still here, both of you  You're still here  You could just leave  You don't have to stand there silently  All I'm going to say is I didn't do shit  Because you did, you made me feel better about myself  That's what you did  No, I fucking came back from that strong  That's what I want people to know  Anthony  The sound of that mic moving was 
[00:00:30]  Anthony Cumia  That's right, Anthony Cumia, your hero  Just moved the microphone  He's not here  Why are you making up shit, he's not even here  And he's pointing at Opie as if to say  Opie is correct, I am not here  When in actuality, Opie is lying to you  Why are you making believe ants here, that's really strange  I don't make believe anything  Really strange shit now  I don't do skits  Are you that desperate?  No  Are you going to sneak out without even saying  Like something degrading? 
[00:01:00]  Clever  Good way out of the bit, by the way  To make believe he's sneaking out  How come you said no to Roland so many times today?  Ah, questions with no answers  Why'd you say that about Kevin Smith?

I may have to reestablish our relationship today then  Because some things are simply more important  You made me feel  That's what I learned 
[00:01:30]  Hold on, just  Yeah  All I ask is  You make the people realize  That I came back strong from that faux pas  Listen  I came back strong  The last hour of the show  You performed very strongly  I didn't say anything to Mickey Ward  You didn't say anything  You didn't say one word to him?  I don't think so  No, yes you did  You brought up the Brian Gumbel thing  Which was different  That was a little something  That was a little Opie Spice  Added to the interview  But  What you did do  That was most  Who's all that talking out there?  Huh? 
[00:02:00]  Who's all those people talking?  That's the ball sack kid  You're not invited  It's a nice little fun gathering  Well I can't go  Could you at least invite me?  And I'll say  Danny's invited  You're not invited  Ah  You're having fun out here  See?  If you guys  I heard somebody say Adam Walsh  So I think I know what they're talking about  I can't wait to hear it again  He's that Anthony  That was Anthony  I heard Anthony's voice  These fuckers are talking about me  I'm not even there  Well guess what  Guess who's one of them  I heard Anthony's voice  That proves he was in here  I heard your voice  You said I can't wait for to hear it again

You're gonna explain that to me  Like I don't know that?  Didn't Sam explain to me  What happened  Because I didn't realize  That I gave it my all  Because I really thought  That's definitely Ice Cube  No I know it was Ice-T  Hadn't Jimmy just said  Oh Ice-T's making his way in here  And you go  Ice Cube  But do we really listen to each other?

[00:24:00]  Awful  Oh my god  This is what I listen to  When I'm out in LA  Anyone that thinks  I'm really living it up out there  This is what I'm listening to  And that's why you have to  Turn it off and make up  Sick fucking puppy sounds  I just torture him  With fucking things  That would get stuck in his head  Is there any lyrics  Yeah  But usually it's like  A five or six minute opening  What?  How long are these songs?  They're long  They're long  Isn't that like the sitar?  No  Different  I put that a guitar that's sitting? 
[00:24:30]  No  You want me to leave this on for you Sam?  Nope  That's kind of peaceful  I actually want to get jerked off to that music  So what's going on?  What's the situation going on?  It's just a thing  Why don't you say what it is?  No  Why?  I get in trouble every day for shit  Yeah I know  Is it the situation that's rumored?  Oh yeah  Oh it is? 
[00:25:00]  Is that true?  The rumor  The rumor  I'm here  It's true  You are?  Yeah  That's sad  From a different source?  I'm just hearing things  It's probably from the same source  Now I get to go  I'm not in trouble  Good  Jonathan good seeing you  Good to see you man  Are you going home with us Jimmy?  Um  No  I think I gotta  I might actually  I'll be down in like a couple minutes  I like that the music's still playing  Yeah  It's just something nice and peaceful  I kind of like it  Can we burn this illegally for me?  It actually sounds a little better than some of the levels that E-Rock was riding today 
[00:25:30]  He's coming in very low with your music today  Yeah you're trying to cause problems with Jimmy  J.B I'll see you later today  You scolded him  I caused my own problems with E-Rock  I don't need your help  Here like here's  You do it every day don't you?  Yes I love it  What's this?  What do we got going on over here?  Oh it's the Genocide Shuffle  What is that?  Same guy?  Yeah same guy  Oh there it is  What's the instrument called again?  Chora  There's the Chora  Troy you ever play any Chora when you're DJing? 
[00:26:00]  No  That makes you want to eat cat  Oh to chew cat?  Yeah I've done that  It's a drug in Yemen  Yeah  Is it?  Yeah  It's a leafy substance and it has to be  Wait here I'll turn this up  Oh is this what you were describing to me?  Yeah it has to be  When you chew it  You have to chew it  Shortly after it's been grown  Because the life  You know  The more potence it is  The quicker it's from when it's been picked  Right  So yeah  Unfortunately in Yemen  They're growing  They're growing so much of it 
[00:26:30]  They're using all of their water to grow it  Jesus  So it's going to go dry  But that's not the one that you have to chew for like five hours  Yeah it is  Oh okay  And after five hours what happens is it feels like you have this kind of double espresso mixed with a daytime allergy pill kind of buzz  It's not like  It's not worth it  It's not worth it  High like you know  You chew for five hours to get that effect  What you can get on a coffee  Yeah  What's wrong with you  Why are they spending all their water to do that?  Why don't you do a shot of day cool and your espresso  Because it's tremendous amount of water to grow it  And I mean I'm telling you 
[00:27:00]  Cat is like  They could tie their national currency to it  That's how important it is  Why don't they get real drugs?  I don't know  You know  That's a good question  You know  They don't drink alcohol  They don't you know  Do a lot of other drugs  But this  The entire country does  Like 99%  Like it  Everything shuts down from one to five basically  And they sit around and they chew cat  For five hours they can get an allergy pill buzz  With some caffeine  Yeah  It's horrid  Give him Pepsi and Benadryl  It's fantastic  I love Jonathan  He has such interesting stories to help distract people from his huge bulge and murder sprees
