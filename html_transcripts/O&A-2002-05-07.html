<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony show opened with a bizarre call from a self-proclaimed 12-year-old Jupiterian alien named “Sandbox” (Zach), who detailed interplanetary wars, a visit to a hippie-like God in Heaven, and his arrival on Earth. He claimed the ability to turn things to stone with his spit and gave directions to supposed “transportation pods” in NYC subway stations, accessible with the password “Al Dukes is a fag.”

The show then heavily promoted the “O&A Money Snatch” contest, a naked money-grab in the studio with an undisclosed twist.  Several women called in to participate, some withdrawing after hearing about the twist, leading to sexually suggestive conversations between the hosts and potential contestants.  The hosts also discussed the ongoing pipe bomb scare involving Luke John Helder of the band Apathy, playing one of their songs and speculating on his motives, mentioning a related car chase.  A previous call from a Special K-influenced Steve-O discussing circumcision and death was briefly mentioned.  An update on “Stalker Patty,” who received temporary hotel accommodations thanks to a listener after a landlord dispute, was also given. The segment concluded with more calls about the Money Snatch contest and a segment of listener-submitted “F.U.” messages.

The next segment involved further phone screenings for the “O&A Money Snatch Games.” Opie, Anthony, and producer Anne aggressively questioned potential female contestants using vulgar and sexually explicit language. A heated exchange with contestant Nicole ensued, but she ultimately remained in the competition. A caller, Tim, complained about missing audio clips of “retards” in sexual education scenarios.  The hosts continued taking calls from potential contestants, including Amber who joined the game,  with conversations filled with crude sexual humor and references to bodily functions and sex toys.  The show also fielded calls about speeding tickets and legal issues, before interviewing sexpert Sadie Allison (promoting "Tickle Your Fancy") and Alex Carroll (author of "Speeding Excuses That Work").  The segment included sexually explicit descriptions and illustrations from Allison's book, bouncing between the contest, guest interviews, and listener calls on various crude and sexually explicit topics. Steve-O’s absence, due to his previous distressed call, was noted. The segment ended with further discussion of the contest and the upcoming Philadelphia broadcast.

A subsequent segment focused on traffic tickets and legal strategies, featuring a debate between a NYC detective and Alex Carroll, with the detective vehemently criticizing Carroll’s methods as scams.  In-studio guests included Sadie Allison, Alex Carroll, comedian Jay Moore (who recounted humorous anecdotes including a gay rodeo experience and teenage masturbation, also promoting his appearance on *More Sports*), and Paul Mercurio, who revealed yelling "Kathleen, put your goddamn clothes back on!" during a *Graduate* performance featuring Kathleen Turner and Jason Biggs (with audio evidence played). The show played audio clips: one an instructional video on explaining wet dreams to intellectually disabled individuals, another showing a mother's reaction to finding her son masturbating.  The segment concluded with scheduling discussions for the “Money Snatch” game and a technical difficulty involving the audio mixing board.


The final segment largely centered on Paul Mercurio's detailed account of his outburst at a theatrical performance featuring a nude actress, including audio of his argument with security.  This was punctuated with colorful language and hyperbole. Updates on “Stalker Patty” were provided, including potential dates with Al Dukes and plans to shave her head at the Opie & Anthony celebrity softball game.  Sandy from New Hampshire, a Money Snatch contestant, and a three-hours-late call-in bit from “Stu” were also featured. The show concluded with reading humorous listener emails. Paul Mercurio remained a guest throughout this segment.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  And welcome to the Opie and Anthony show. We've got to get right into it because we have so much going on today, Anthony.  Very bussy show. We had a lot of stuff yesterday we weren't able to get to. We must cover that today.  So for once we can't waste time. No. With those silly sound clips and stuff. We've got to get right into the meat of the show.  Ah! Well that one's always good to play though. Yeah!  A couple phone numbers in the New York City area. 877-692-1027. Outside of New York. 866-2774. 
[00:00:30]  Wow, that number again. Write it down. You're going to need it because this is a very interactive radio show.  866-2774. Wow, if you're outside of New York.  Roy, well there's a kid on the line. We've got to get right to him. A kid named Sandbox.  Sandbox.  Lil Sandbox.  He says the Earth is going to explode.  He's going to tell us how to get to Jupiter.  All right.  Let's see what that's all about. 
[00:01:00]  Hey, Sandbox.  Hello.  Hey, what's up, man?  Hey, guys.  What's up?  What's up?  How old are you, Sandbox?  Me?  Huh?  I'm 12.  Oh, 12-year-old Sandbox.  I need to tell you about tactical plans of how to survive this Earth blast.  Now, why is the Earth...  This is tactical.  Why is the Earth...  I'll start off with why I know all this.  Hey, Sandbox.  Well, actually, my real name is Zach.  Why is the Earth going to blow up?  The sun is going to cause a chain reaction of a sun explosion, and it will going to attack the Earth. 
[00:01:30]  12 is such an interesting age, Ovi.  It's that age where you can either really be starting to get mature.  You know what I mean?  Like it's the 12-year-old that might sit with the family and discuss even politics or things like that.  Politics sucks.  And then there's kids 12 years old, like Sandbox here, who is talking about...  My name is Zach.  ...who is talking about the Earth exploding because of some chain reactor.  Okay, explain what's going to happen, Zach.  Okay, well, actually, I'm an alien called a Jupiterian. 
[00:02:00]  You're an alien.  Yes, I am.  What video games do you play, Sandbox?  GTA 3, State of Emergency.  That's a good one.  I like hitting old ladies with bats.  That's a lot of fun on the game.  All right, so what's your theory?  The sun's going to explode and attack the Earth?  Yes, what's it called?  Well, actually, the Jupiterians and the sun people have been at war for many centuries to come.  And, well, I'm in my third life right now.  You're in your third life.  Yeah, in human ages, I'm only 287. 
[00:02:30]  Oh, that's it?  Hey, guys, you want to know what I look like?  That's nothing, though.  Yeah, what do you look like there, Zach?  Okay, I have really big, puffy cheeks, and my eyes are blue.  And I have a big nose.  Well, your face will grow into your nose, yeah.  It will?  Yeah, don't worry about that.  It will?  Kids are friggin' hysterical.  It will?  So what happens, like, how are we going to get to Jupiter?  All right, all right, this is the way.  And how do you figure out that you're one of these sun people, or a Jupiterian?  Well, Jupiterians are very peaceful aliens. 
[00:03:00]  Aren't they called Jovian?  What?  People, like, beings from Jupiter are called Jovians, not Jupiterians.  How much do you want to bet?  I bet you any amount of money, dude.  Well, how did he figure out he was a Jupiterian?  Oh, oh, I'll bet you stalker Paddy's leftover hair.  All right, but how did you figure out you were a Jupiterian?  I've known this ever since I came to Earth.  Of course, when he came to Earth, he knew it already, because he had been from Jupiter.  All right, so how did you get here? 
[00:03:30]  Well, actually, my parents, when I'm in my second life, we were still being on the war against the sun people.  And, well...  Now, how do people live on the sun?  It's very hot.  Yeah, well, there's sun people, and they're able to live in that habitat.  That's all the explanation I need.  Okay.  So now you, why did you come to Earth from Jupiter?  Because, what's it called, my parents didn't think it was a good place for me starting off my second life as a child.  You know, they sent me to heaven.  I saw God.  He actually looks more like a hippie than a savior.  And, what's it called, he sent me to Earth. 
[00:04:00]  He sent me to my dad's unit, junk, you know, whatever you want to call it, and then I came.  That's how I was raised.  So your parents are definitely Jupiterians, too?  Yeah.  But not my Earth parents.  Not your Earth parents?  No.  Wait, wait, you were, hold on, wait, are you doing, like, a Superman thing?  What?  Hold on, you were put from Jupiter, your Jupiter parents put you in your Earth parents' junk?  No, they sent me to heaven.  God put me, Opie, you know how I got here, like, human-wise. 
[00:04:30]  Why would I know?  How would Opie know?  How do I know?  Is Opie from Jupiter?  A one-night stand with Stalker Patty, maybe.  So, now, what you're saying is, from Jupiter, your parents from Jupiter sent you to God.  Yep.  God then?  He said, yeah, he, like, made me.  Hold on, hold on, we dumped out of your father's name.  Don't say your father's name.  Oh, sorry, sorry.  Don't say your father's name.  We don't want the FBI coming to arrest the Jupiterians.  Woo!  So, you went to see God. 
[00:05:00]  Yeah.  And then God put you into your Earth father's junk, and you were, you know, conceived and  born here.  Yep.  But you're actually from Jupiter.  Yes.  Inside I'm a Jupiterian, outside I'm a very ugly human.  Do you have any?  No, I'm not.  Don't worry, kid, you'll get better looking.  Hey, do you have any special powers?  Yes, I do.  I can turn things into stone by spitting on it. 
[00:05:30]  By spitting on stuff, you can turn it into stone?  Yep.  Can you come down and show us your special powers?  What?  Can you come down and show us your special powers?  Oh, that's up to my mommy.  Why?  Your mom tells you to use your special powers or not?  My mommy, she's after a note to drop me off at the studio.  I can show you.  I can turn it into a monster also.  You can turn it into a monster?  Yeah, I can turn it into something that looks like the Hulk, but it has a beard.  But it has a beard?  Yeah, it looks like a black girl when he was a hippie.  Do you get good grades in school? 
[00:06:00]  No, I'm sorry.  No?  That's confidential.  Confidential.  You must do good in science.  All right, well, let's get to the meat of the...  Actually, science is my worst subject.  How many things have you turned into stone with your spit?  I can turn, let's say, I can make a statue out of anything.  But you've done this before?  Yes, I have.  I turned my brother into a statue, but then I had to bring him back.  How do you bring him back?  I say some stuff, and then he comes back.  You want to hear what I say?  Yeah.  All right. 
[00:06:30]  Paradoonga ha-cha-ha!  What is that?  Paradoonga ha-cha-ha!  Man, if you're high listening to the show today, you're getting a treat.  What?  Oh, nothing.  Nothing, sandbox.  All right, so the Earth's going to explode because the sun's going to explode and attack the Earth or whatever, right?  Yeah, but you want to know how to get from Jupiter?  No, we want to get to Jupiter.  You said you were going to tell us how to get to Jupiter.  Yes, I will.  All right, tell us how.  First, okay, what's it called?  There's places in New York and as well as all around the other world, they're little transportation devices. 
[00:07:00]  Oh, is it?  Yeah, they kind of look like little pods, and it can hold up to millions of people at a time.  And that'll transport us at light speed from Earth to Jupiter.  All right.  But don't you worry, because Jupiter has plenty of air, food, and water.  Now, everything we've sent to Jupiter shows that the atmosphere is not conducive to human beings living there.  I don't know what that means.  I'm sorry.  All right, I just want to know where the pod is.  Where's the pod?  We ain't got no pod. 
[00:07:30]  No pods that we go to.  My parents, yeah, my whole family is against marijuana.  Right, right.  No, Zach, how do we find the transportation pod?  Well, I can tell you directions to one in New York City and one in Valley Cottage.  All right, where is it?  Valley Cottage by Nyack, New York.  All right, where's the New York City one?  Yeah, because we're going to send someone there.  Okay, New York City is in a subway.  Yeah?  It's in all the subways.  In between the, you know where the trains go, the train tracks?  The little things that have, like, the bars and stuff. 
[00:08:00]  What?  What?  The stations?  Yeah.  Okay.  There's a step called Tumbana Steps.  Tumbana Steps?  There's the pods that bring you.  And, wait, they're right in the station, or where are they?  They're inside the station.  All right, you know where you get the tickets?  Right.  The tokens and stuff?  It's behind there.  Oh, there's secret stairs?  I have to say, secret password for it to open.  What's the password?  Okay, listen very carefully.  Okay.  Al Dukes is a fag. 
[00:08:30]  Al Dukes is a fag is the password?  Yep, and then it'll open and it'll say, welcome to Tumbana.  Then you follow me, and it'll be like, follow me as you can.  I'm the gingerbread man.  All right, and we follow you down to the pod.  Yeah.  Yep, and then you'll get to Jupiter.  It's really cool.  Is there hot chicks on Jupiter for all of us?  Actually, yeah.  Yeah.  All right, well, thank you.  They don't have a year.  Hey, thank you, Harry Potter.  We've got to move on with our show.  Wait, I have one more thing to say. 
[00:09:00]  Yes.  Uh-oh, very important.  Sandbox.  This is very important.  Now, you must listen.  I'm listening.  Al Dukes is a fag.  All right, thank you.  I hate him.  All right, thank you, Sandbox.  Bye.  Bye.  Coincidentally, he's the same kid that kicked me out of the Cats and Hats guild on EverQuest.  Very upset with Sandbox or Zack, whatever his name is.  Wow.  Kid's pretty witty for 12, though.  God damn kid.  Is that witty or is that mental illness, Hopi?  What did we just hear?  I think it's a little wit.  I know at 12, I went through a phase where I was a complete science geek. 
[00:09:30]  I would go to school.  I was very into astronomy and the planets and everything.  You probably had a microscope.  I had microscopes, chemistry sets.  I was the geekiest kid.  Bill, I see Bill laughing.  He would come over to my house.  Cowbell Bill's here today.  Bill would come over to the house to hang out with my brother and smoke pot and do cool stuff. 
[00:10:00]  And they would just rag on me relentlessly.  My brother, like, I'd be all psyched because that night something happened and I'd bring my telescope out.  And he'd just be like, bring your telescope out, you faggot.  Faggot.  And he'd tell me how embarrassed he was because I was such a geek, nerd, you know.  And I was so into that.  But then it was about 12 years old or so, maybe even 11, 12, I kind of started getting interested in girls. 
[00:10:30]  You know what I mean?  And that Fs up everything.  And everything else went out the window.  All of a sudden, I didn't want to make believe I was Godzilla.  Walking around.  I'm crushing things.  Like, ah, you know, things like that.  So it seems like Lil' Zack is still in the phase where he believes he's an alien from Jupiter.  His story is very well thought out, though.  He's a Jupiterian.  Like, because a kid says he's from Jupiter, right?  What do you do?  You say, all right, how'd you get here?  Well, maybe he is from Jupiter. 
[00:11:00]  No spaceship, nothing.  The guy went to God, who then put him in his father's seed and made him conceive as a child here on Earth.  And now he has Earth parents.  Right.  He's got Earth parents, but he's still from Jupiter.  Here we're laughing and mocking him.  What if he's...  What if he's absolutely right and he was telling us everything in the subway station to have the goddamn pod?  And he told us that we ignore him.  He told us the password.  I don't even remember it now.  And all of a sudden, the sun explodes and the Earth gets destroyed.  And look at us now. 
[00:11:30]  I don't remember that secret word.  He went, abadooby-dooby.  I don't know what that was.  I just completely forgot everything he said already.  All right.  We've got to move on in because we've got so much to do.  Let's go right to Maura.  What's up, Maura?  Hello.  What's up, Maura?  Hi.  How are you?  Pretty good.  Why are you calling on?  I was calling to find out I want to come in tomorrow for the Money Snatch contest.  The O&A Money Snatch team.  Going down tomorrow right here in the studio.  We have, what, five or six contestants that are confirmed.  We need at least three or four more. 
[00:12:00]  Oh, good.  How old are you?  27.  27 years old.  And you've been listening to us as far as this concept goes?  Yes, I have.  Very good.  You know, you'll be in the studio with, like, hopefully seven or eight other girls completely naked,  running around collecting as much dollar bills as possible.  We're going to have dollar bills everywhere in the studio.  Comfortable?  Hanging from the ceiling, on the walls, on the floor.  Comfortable with your nude body? 
[00:12:30]  Yes, I am.  Yes.  Should you be proud of it?  I think so.  Oh, yeah?  Yeah.  What's that mean?  Oh, I'm happy with it.  You're from Jupiter?  No?  No.  Just asking now.  I want to get that password again.  Now, you know there's another twist, right?  Yes.  I heard about the other twist.  We need all...  I didn't actually hear, but, you know, I heard that you...  Well, we need all the girls...  You know, the other girls talking about it.  We need all the girls completely naked for this Money Snatch game.  Uh-huh.  And then there's another twist that Ant's going to explain to you. 
[00:13:00]  I'll explain it to you.  Most girls say no after they hear the final twist.  Some say yes.  Right.  Oh, I think I just like being in the studio with, you know, a bunch of other naked girls.  Oh!  Hey, hey, hey!  No problem there.  Very nice.  All right.  Ant's going to describe the final twist of the contest, okay?  Okay.  I'm going to turn down his mic and you listen closely to Anthony.  All right.  Mara, can she hear me? 
[00:13:30]  I can't hear you.  Oh, there we go.  We're set up?  I can hear you now.  All right, Mara.  How are you today?  I'm doing good.  Sexually active, are you?  Um, yeah, pretty much.  How long?  Oh, I guess about eight years.  Oh, you get it a lot, do you?  As much as I can.  Oh.  And that means like how much?  I didn't hear that.  How much?  How much is, uh, when you can? 
[00:14:00]  Once a week?  Oh, no.  My boyfriend likes it every day.  Oh, hey, that's nice.  There you go.  All right.  I can't hear you.  How big?  He's very big.  Oh, really?  I couldn't.  Whoops.  Um, I think so. 
[00:14:30]  Yeah, not all torn up enough.  No, no, no.  It's little.  It's getting to the twist right about now.  I understand. 
[00:15:00]  It's already pretty wet.  I have no idea what that means.  We don't know what Aunt asked her, so don't dump out.  I have no clue.  It was, uh, you know.  Oh, I forgot.  I'm not supposed to read.  Yeah, yeah.  Don't read anything.  That's fine, though.  I'm sorry.  Mara, does that mean you're in?  I'm in.  All right.  You have no problem with the twist.  No problem with that.  All right.  Sounds pretty dinky. 
[00:15:30]  All right.  There you go.  Hold on.  Rick is going to add you to the list of names that will be joining us tomorrow  for the O&A Money Snatch Game.  Okay.  All right, Mara.  Thank you.  It has to be the voice.  All right.  Mara's on line one there.  Adam, what's going on?  Yo, what's up, guys?  Hey.  Yo, you've got to play that bit again with the kid at 520.  Why is that?  Why?  It was so good.  It was like the best thing next to your CBS bit.  Isn't that funny?  Like, kids are hysterical.  That kid was great.  Yeah.  Well, he's calling back with the password because we all forgot it. 
[00:16:00]  But please, please, please play that whole segment again.  All right.  All right.  Thank you, Adam.  Later.  Let's go back to Sandbox.  Sandbox.  Sandbox.  Sandbox.  Yeah.  No, this is Zach.  Well, Zach.  Hey, Zach.  Yeah, that's my other name.  That's my human name.  Zach is your human name and Sandbox is your Jupiterian name?  No, that's just my nickname because I like to lay in the sand.  And I like to put lamb on my face and pretend I'm Hannibal Lecter.  What's your Jupiter name?  All right, and he is what? 
[00:16:30]  My Jupiter name?  Yeah.  My Jupiter name is Goku.  Goku?  Yeah.  That's pretty cool.  What does Goku mean?  Goku is, actually, I can't tell you my real name, but Goku is my nickname in Jupiterian.  It means Sandbox.  It means one who is fast.  Oh, because you're fast.  No, actually, I'm very soft.  Do you have many friends?  May I have to?  Can I answer?  Hello?  Well, he hung up. 
[00:17:00]  He hung up.  Okay.  Yes, he didn't like the question.  He didn't give us the password.  Something tells me the answer to my question was no, none.  David, what's going on?  Another 12-year-old checking in.  Hey, David.  What's up, David?  Hi.  Hey.  I just want to say, I go to middle school, and my friends and I, we love you guys.  We listen to you every day.  It's the only thing that can keep us alive through school is we get to come listen to you.  David, what planet are you from?  I'm from Earth.  Oh, okay. 
[00:17:30]  Good.  You're not like a little Sandbox?  No, not like Sandbox.  And Zach, Anthony.  Zach.  I just want to say, have you guys heard of the D.A.R.E. program for schools?  The D.A.R.  The D.A.R. program, yeah.  Yeah, you have to get the D.A.R.E. video, the animated D.A.R.E. video.  It's hilarious.  What is it about?  Well, these kids, they have to go to the land of decisions and choices, and these drug  dealers, they dress up in buddy suits to try to convince the kids to...  That they're their pals?  Yeah, to pretend that they're pals, but all the kids, they band together against the drug 
[00:18:00]  dealers, and this one kid, she has to clean up, like, it shows in the beginning, she has  to clean up the beer bottles after her father, and it's supposed to be sad, but we all laughed  at it.  Ah, you wacky kids these days.  So you're not learning anything about that, about drugs?  No, not learning anything.  You're just openly laughing at the silly fellas.  Just openly laughing.  All right, see?  There you go.  Okay, I have to say hi to Jim and Chris.  There you go.  Thank you, David. 
[00:18:30]  Thanks, guys.  Breaking news, we just put more in the contest for the ONA Money Snatch game.  Yeah.  Rick has talked to her, and what's going on?  She's out?  Yeah.  Why?  She can't commit until tomorrow, and then she hung up when I put her on hold.  God damn it.  See?  We're having a tough time filling all the spots for the ONA Money Snatch game.  Jewel from PA, what's up?  Hi.  Hi.  What's wrong, Jewel?  I want to be in the Money Snatch.  You do?  Yes.  How old are you? 
[00:19:00]  Twenty-three.  Would you be available tomorrow?  Tomorrow.  Yes.  You could get in your car and take a little road trip, right?  Yes.  All right.  And you were on hold all day yesterday?  Yes.  All right.  You know, we need to get some contestants here.  It seems like a lot of the girls are a bunch of prudes.  But we're getting a lot of calls for this.  You understand you have to be completely nude?  Yeah, I don't have a problem with that.  I used to be a stripper.  Oh, you did, did you?  Can you be here by 2.30 tomorrow?  Yeah. 
[00:19:30]  Definitely, right?  Definitely.  All right.  Ann's going to explain the other twist.  And if you have no problem with the other twist, we'll get you in the game, okay?  Okay.  All right.  I'm going to turn Anthony's mic off.  Here's the music.  And Ann will talk to Jewel from PA.  Hi, Jewel.  Hi.  How are you doing?  Good.  Good.  You're out.  You want to be in the contest?  Yes.  You were a stripper, you're saying?  Yes.  Yes.  Yeah.  How much big? 
[00:20:00]  Well, probably about eight inches.  And a lot of it?  Wow.  Wait, wait, wait, Jewel.  That was really hot, but you know what?  You can't say that.  She's going to be perfect for the contest.  All right.  We'll continue.  We had to jump out of that.  Very nice.  I'm glad you liked that.  All right.  Go ahead, Ann. 
[00:20:30]  Okay.  See, I'm going to tell her open.  Oh, sorry.  Do, do, do, do, do.  Uh-huh.  Okay.  Yeah.  All right, Alfie.  She seems to be fine with it. 
[00:21:00]  Jewel, you're totally fine?  Yeah, I'm totally fine.  Are you, are you, really?  Yeah.  You don't sound excited.  You don't sound like...  I thought that was going to be the twist.  I'm not surprised.  Yeah, but you're going to do this.  Yeah.  You could win a lot of money tomorrow.  I plan to.  Does that include loose change?  All right, Jewel, hold on the line, okay?  Okay.  I don't know if she's completely in.  Yeah, that sounded a little...  Well, I hope so. 
[00:21:30]  We can't...  Jewel.  Yeah?  You're not going to let us down tomorrow, are you?  No.  You sound kind of...  I need to win some money.  But you don't sound too excited to come to New York...  I'm excited.  ...and join the other girls in the studio naked for the O&A Money Snatch game.  Oh, I'm excited just to see you guys.  Well, but you've got to do the contest.  I will.  Oh, boy.  Okay, hold on the line, Jewel.  All right, hold on.  Hold on.  Rick's going to talk to you.  I sure hope so.  Okay.  Joey.  Hey, what's up?  What's up?  Just wanted to tell you, that little Jupiter guy, as funny as he was, Goku is like a main 
[00:22:00]  character on Dragon Ball Z.  Dragon Ball Z.  To catch any night on Cartoon Network.  I'm looking at the website for Dragon Ball Z.  So he's not really from Jupiter?  Maybe.  I don't know.  No.  All right.  The story of Goku, the son of Gohan, and a handful of friends who battled for the Earth  and all the good against deadly forces. 
[00:22:30]  Sandbox better call back.  He's a fraud.  He's a 12-year-old fraud.  So now friends, allies, and enemies band together for the invasion.  I'm reading, but I don't see anything about Jupiter.  I don't know.  Maybe the kid's legit.  Maybe it's just a coincidence.  Ah, Sandbox.  Hey, guys.  You're a fraud.  Yo.  No, no, no.  I'm just kidding.  Yo, I like Dragon Ball Z.  Yo, my phone got disconnected.  I'm not a fraud.  You're definitely a Jupiterian, right?  Yes, I am. 
[00:23:00]  You want me to come down there and show you my royal Jupiterian birthmark?  It's blue and green and brown.  How is that?  And where is this birthmark?  What?  Where is it?  It's on my eyeball.  It kind of looks weird.  It looks like I have cataracts, but, you know, no.  Can you see extra special things with that eye?  Yep.  It's kind of like I can see through walls and stuff, and I can see, like, pink panthers  stealing diamonds.  Well, we want you to come down here and turn things into stone.  Okay.  You want me to? 
[00:23:30]  Yeah.  Oh, hold on.  I need to tell you the password.  Oh, yeah.  Listeners must know.  All right.  What's the password to get on the pod?  Okay.  I don't think Al Dukes is gay, but the password is Al Dukes is gay.  Oh, that's right.  Al Dukes is gay.  Right.  But what's that thing you said?  Yeah, what is that?  Yeah, that's...  What?  What is that?  I can't tell you.  No, because that was necessary to do something.  That's my Jupiter...  I can't tell you.  Are you part of a Jupiterian cell?  Is that like a secret message to all the other Jupiterians? 
[00:24:00]  Okay.  Can I tell you...  Are you using our radio show to contact all the other Jupiterians?  Yeah, I have a code that's like that.  Huh?  I have a code that I can contact people with.  All right, hold on.  In my mind.  Hello?  Hold on, hold on, hold on.  We're talking to Kyle here.  Hey, Kyle.  Hey.  What's up, man?  I used to be exactly like that kid.  You're cool, man.  When I was like 12 years old, until I smoked pot.  What happened?  I started doing drugs, and I just said, hey, what the hell?  Ecstasy is bad. 
[00:24:30]  Right.  Good boy.  Hey, you've got to ease off, kid.  You are weird.  All right.  I don't do we.  Hey, Zach.  Yeah.  Are you considered like a weirdo in school?  No, people don't even know who I am.  I'm the...  Yeah, I used to be like that.  I used to get made fun of every day.  I don't get made fun of.  You know what happens to me?  What?  People call me bad names.  Yeah.  Oh, wait.  That's being made fun of, isn't it?  And then what?  All right.  Oh, he's always admitting anything.  All right, Kyle. 
[00:25:00]  Thank you.  Yeah, see you at the softball game.  All right.  Yo, guys.  Yeah, go.  Oh, what's it called?  That guy was calling about Dragon Ball Z before?  Yeah.  Let me tell you, that's not a regular cartoon, though.  That cartoon's mad, like, violent.  Yeah.  It really is.  Go on to the other website, dbghtlegacy.com.  Hold on, Zach.  A lot of people now call and say that's the main plot line in Dragon Z.  That guy that spits, it turns into stone.  Hold on.  Okay.  We're on to you.  You're a fraud.  You're fake.  You're not really from Jupiter.  And you're spit.  I can't tell you my Jupiterian name. 
[00:25:30]  And your spit doesn't.  All right.  If I did that, do you know how many people will be asking me why the hell did you do that?  Zach, your spit doesn't turn stuff into stone, either.  Yes, it does.  That's the plot line of a cartoon.  Go out and play baseball.  I am a cartoon.  Go have a catch with your dad.  You know what I look like?  You want me to come down there and turn things into stone or not?  You can't.  Go get a skateboard.  Yes, I can.  Go out outside like every other 12-year-old.  Play outside.  Get out of the house.  Get a game of kickball going.  Do you know what I do?  What? 
[00:26:00]  I play tennis.  It's a good cover.  All right.  Thank you, Zach.  Thank you.  Wait.  Hold on.  One minute.  No.  Yes.  No.  Yes.  No.  Please?  No.  Please?  No.  Norton rules.  You guys suck.  No.  What?  What?  No.  Yeah?  No.  Hey, Zach?  Yeah.  I've got to tell you something.  All right.  Listen.  We've got to take a break.  That was immature.  Yeah.  All right.  We have the sex bird from yesterday that we blew off.  Yeah. 
[00:26:30]  Stark of Patty update.  I think she was in a hotel last night.  Thanks to Joyce.  Yeah.  Who lives under the console.  We have Alex Carroll coming in, Anthony.  The speeding ticket guy.  Right.  She's got to get out of tickets.  We have Paul, put your goddamn clothes back on, Mercurio coming in today.  Put your goddamn clothes back on.  We got the trainable audio clips from yesterday we forgot to play.  Never got to those.  And we've got to talk about the celebrity bikini softball game.  Tickets going fast.  Not many tickets available, Anthony. 
[00:27:00]  Yeah.  And they're going fast through Ticketmaster.  So stay there and we'll continue.  Opie.  I'm the dick.  Anthony.  I'm an ass.  Why are you wasting your time with this sleazy trash?  People are starting to say funniest radio ever, so don't wreck it.  And we're back with the Opie and Anthony show.  Thanks for checking us out today.  So have we gotten the pipe bomber yet in? 
[00:27:30]  This guy seems to be the dumbest individual on the face of the earth.  Here's a, you know, the pipe bombs been going on.  Texas.  Where else?  I know he's kind of...  I've been looking at the map on CNN and Fox and stuff.  It looks like he's trying to spell something.  Well, he made a perfectly round circle.  He made a perfectly round circle.  It could be an O.  It could be an O.  I would spell the F word.  Like, plant your bombs in places that spell the F word.  So then if you succeed, the news has to put the map with the word, you know, the F word. 
[00:28:00]  Right there on TV.  You win.  Well, this guy's been putting pipe bombs in people's mailboxes.  Then he adds a letter with some anti-U.S. government rhetoric on it.  And he moves on.  Goes somewhere else.  Six people were injured last week in Iowa and Illinois.  Planted them in Nebraska, Colorado, and then recently Texas.  Well, this guy not quite the Unabomber. 
[00:28:30]  Remember the Unabomber?  He would craft bombs.  Maybe one every eight months to a year.  Craft them out of wood, exotic woods and stuff.  And they said that he may have sanded some of the wood for up to a week just for a piece of these bombs that he used to make.  And then he'd make sure that any message delivered with the bombs was completely untraceable.  The only way they caught the Unabomber, his brother ratted him out.  Pretty much this guy would have gone on forever. 
[00:29:00]  This schmuck, two days or, what is it, a week into a, barely a week.  Barely a week.  I'm hearing they've got the guy's name, his picture, the type of car he drives.  The guy is in the middle of Texas with Minnesota license plates.  Yeah.  As we say around here when Earl climbs a ladder to replace a light bulb, the jig's up on this guy.  What?  The name Luke John Helder.  He's 22 years old. 
[00:29:30]  White male.  What a surprise there.  All these loonies, white guys.  He's driving a Honda Accord with Minnesota license plates, armed and dangerous.  I mean, they know exactly who this guy is.  Now, more info coming in, Opie.  Yeah.  The guy is in a band.  He's in a rock band called Apathy.  Oh, I thought it was a former member of Rotgut.  Rotgut.  Really pissed off that you moved on and started doing radio.  No.  A disgruntled band member. 
[00:30:00]  A disgruntled band member.  His name was Rex Sabasco.  I think we want to hear a piece of...  Well, let me give a little bio here.  Apathy, band out of Rochester, Minnesota.  Is that really the band?  It's out of that area, yeah.  You sure?  Yeah, we're thinking this is...  Sure, it's him.  It's got his name attached to it.  I don't want to plug another band.  Why not?  It looks like it.  I hear he's pissed off because the rest of the guys started a journey cover band in Evolution. 
[00:30:30]  Is that true?  The band Evolution?  The journey cover band?  No?  I'm wrong.  I'm getting conflicting reports.  We're getting the news in as we speak.  So, some of the reports might be erroneous, Opie.  I hear you.  We have to, you know, sort through this.  I thought it was, you know...  Because we're responsible journalists.  Journalists.  We don't just jump.  No.  So, we have to get the news out there.  Apathy.  Described as...  What the hell do they say here?  Described as like a Nirvana type thing. 
[00:31:00]  These guys are kind of into the heavy metal.  The grunge thing, they call it.  Well, let's take a listen to Apathy.  Let's hear a little Apathy.  Some of the Pipe Bombers music.  Is he the lead singer?  He's the guitarist and I believe the vocalist.  Okay.  Wheel in the sky keeps on turning.  No?  No?  Sounds a little dark.  That sounds like he has issues.  Oh, wait a minute. 
[00:31:30]  You think?  Yeah.  Sounds like the beginning of a Bad Company song.  Company always on the run.  Destiny.  I put that in.  That would add it.  Wouldn't that be cool? 
[00:32:00]  Oh, look out.  Open your mailbox.  Oh, no.  All right.  Here we go.  Okay.  Now it's Metallica.  Metallica.  All right.  He's rocking.  Music to blow up mailboxes too, right?  Uh-oh.  Yeah.  Uh-oh.  He's losing me. 
[00:32:30]  That's James Hetfield.  That's James Hetfield.  I'm going to blow up your mailbox.  Frogs.  Frogs.  Pipe bomber guys.  It is dark.  Day is night.  Yeah.  Dark is light.  All you do is fight.  It's all I see. 
[00:33:00]  That's a little too white suburban Midwestern, doesn't he?  Pipe bomber guys, Steve.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Don't tread on me.  Don't tread on me.  What do you think, Steve?  See?  You're like, you know, a heavy metal...  You're a band guy.  Yeah.  I've got some pretty diverse tastes, but that really stinks.  I mean, that is such white suburban crap. 
[00:33:30]  High school crap rock.  This is the guy that's blowing a mailboxes all over the place.  Well, he's got to be good at something, because he sure as hell isn't good about songwriting.  Luke John Helder.  He rocks.  In her.  Yeah.  In you.  All right.  There's apathy, Anthony.  Apathy.  Rock.  Right?  A little taste of his music.  They're just hours away from catching this guy.  Oh, yeah.  You're going to get this guy.  The other thing we've got to mention real fast, there was another car chase just before 
[00:34:00]  the show again today.  Thank God it ended before we went on the air, or we'd have to sit through a lot of lousy  radio.  Well, this guy was even stupider than the guy yesterday.  Yeah.  Well, this guy, he was pretty much in a commercial and residential area.  He never hit the freeway.  He was trying to figure out where the freeway was, and he was trying to find it.  He got lost.  He got lost in a neighborhood, one of these California suburbs of Glenwood, or where was  he?  Right around L.A. through the outskirts, so it was a residential area with a lot of 
[00:34:30]  those winding roads in a pretty similar housing development type thing.  And he's going, and we're just screaming at the TV, come on, hit him in the rear end.  When he's going around those curves, you spin him out.  The guy drives into a cul-de-sac.  So we're just watching.  With five cop cars on his tail.  Everyone in the office is like, oh, no, you dick.  So he does the turnaround, and he starts coming out, and the cops are all coming in.  So they go three abreast. 
[00:35:00]  Now it looks like I'm playing Grand Theft Auto 3.  Yeah, trying to get past the police car.  Right.  So what we saw, he did almost make it, because one of the cops didn't get to the front or  back of him, but kind of wedged him between the curb and his car.  So he's starting to try to squeeze out from between the curb and the car, and another  cop, bam, hits him right in the front.  So now the front is blocked.  So he tries to back up.  Another car right there.  Bam.  Blocked him in.  Pulled their guns.  Drag him out of the car. 
[00:35:30]  Turned out to be some long-haired hippie-looking dude.  Yeah.  From Jupiter.  You know what the cops out there have to do?  They've got to blow someone's brains out.  Well, I think that would set a precedent.  Well, then people wouldn't want to, you know, get into these car chases.  They'd want to chase.  I think they're really fun.  And Fox, at least they didn't pull way out of this one.  No, Fox is stupid, though, because the car chase could end at any second, and they're  going to some stupid boat fire.  It's a fire.  They're going to a boat fire.  Who cares?  You can't turn off a car chase ever.  No. 
[00:36:00]  You don't know when it's going to end.  Because they don't replay the crash.  Like, when it ends in a crash, they don't then replay it.  If you blink and miss it, you're screwed.  Exactly.  Sounds like Weird Al doing a Metallica parody.  That's what John B. is saying as a review to Apathy, the Pipe Bomber's band.  Isn't that Striper?  That sounds a little bit like Striper.  And people congratulating us on beating K-Rock to the premiere of Apathy.  Well, there you go.  We're always on top of the latest trends, Anthony. 
[00:36:30]  Yeah.  Phil, what's up?  Hey.  Hey.  When are you going to get to that bit with Steve-O and circumcision not making you a member  bigger?  You're going to do that yesterday, but you ran out of show.  We did run out of show.  Steve-O from Jackass called us after smoking Special K.  It was his words, not ours.  He said, hey, I'm effed up on Special K and decided to call you guys.  And I don't know.  He was talking a lot of crap and said something about circumcision, and then we had to go off  the air, and we're trying to get a hold of him.  He said something about how he's going to die. 
[00:37:00]  How he's going to die, so I don't know what that was even about.  So we're trying to get him on the phone today, and so far we haven't had any luck.  So if we could track him down, we'll certainly have him on the air there, Phil.  All right.  All right?  You guys rule.  Morton sucks.  All right.  Thank you.  All right.  Yeah.  I mean, he was babbling yesterday at the end of the show.  Yeah.  Cheryl, what's up?  Hey, guys.  Hey.  I'm calling to check on Stalker Patty versus the Trailer Park Descendant.  I'd also like to know if there's a Stalker Patty fund.  We're working on some things, but I don't even know if she's alive today. 
[00:37:30]  Oh, no.  We don't know where she is.  We haven't heard from her.  She's supposed to come in today to get her hair shaved.  Last we knew, we were whisked out of here to go to some big-time meetings.  Yes.  And she was on her own.  Yeah.  You put her in a hotel, and she didn't sleep on the couch.  Well, I didn't put her anywhere.  No, I guess Joyce, who's a faithful listener of our show, she stepped up and, I don't know,  got Patty a room in a hotel.  That's the last we've heard, and we don't know what's going on.  Maybe Joyce could call the show today and tell us exactly what happened after the show yesterday, okay? 
[00:38:00]  All right.  All right.  And Norton has a huge mule.  And you guys suck.  How do you know he has a huge mule?  Wow.  I've heard the word.  Ah.  All right.  Thank you, Cheryl.  The word of the mule.  All right.  Thanks, guys.  All right.  We're going to take a break, Anthony.  I've got friggin' apathy stuck in my head now.  Who, some people are saying it should be called crapathy. 
[00:38:30]  Sympathy.  Brian from Boston says, you think the pipe bomber guy was upset because everyone was laughing  at his crackling feminine voice.  Hey, we don't broadcast out there, do we?  We're in Texas, and he's in Texas.  We're so happy.  Look, look.  Hopefully they'll get him before this airs in Dallas.  Pipe up guy.  Hey, you rule, man.  You rock.  I'm diggin' your stuff.  Opie hates you, though.  Can you imagine?  He's driving around tonight.  What is it?  A Celica?  It's his Honda.  His silver Honda Accord.  Silver Honda with the Minnesota license plates. 
[00:39:00]  And, you know, he's listening to us in Dallas.  We're on Late Night in Dallas, and they still haven't caught him, and all of a sudden it's  like, holy, yes, they're playing my band.  I'm going to New York.  Right.  Well, if it's a publicity stunt to get your band played on the radio, good job, pipe bomber  guy.  Maybe it's some kind of king of comedy thing.  Even Joe, my brother, never thought of that wacky scheme when he was trying to get our band  tapes played.  And Joe has tried them all, hasn't he?  Oh, Joe going into Sony Records with his tin-knocking gear on.  Yeah, walking right past security and everyone telling him, I've got to go up to this emergency 
[00:39:30]  duct repair I've got to do.  Right.  And they let him up, and he gets into one of the bigwigs' offices and goes, dude, man,  here's the tape of my band.  Oh, my God.  Have this guy removed.  Have this man removed.  He didn't get arrested for doing that?  No, he got booted out of the building, though.  See, Joe, you never went the pipe bomb route.  Pipe bomb guy just was broadcast on 18 cities.  18 cities got to hear apathy today. 
[00:40:00]  Got to airplay.  Okay.  We're going to go...  Ah, look at this.  Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.  I just got a cease and desist from the lawyer for apathy.  Saying stop playing, and the release date isn't for another month.  Damn.  And this just in.  K-Rock now claiming they were first with the apathy record on their station.  We broke it here.  But they're claiming they did, Anthony.  Right.  They're going to dedicate a whole weekend to apathy to try to prove us wrong.  Are we going to do a tribute when the police just blow this guy's head off? 
[00:40:30]  Or he blows his own head off with a shotgun or something?  Yeah, we can do an apathy tribute.  We can do a tribute.  Sure, why not?  We'll play the whole catalog.  All three songs on the demo.  All right, we got a break.  All right, man.  And hopefully we'll get an update.  A Stalker Patty update next.  Wow, Opie.  This one just for you and some locals out on Long Island.  Brian from Stony Brook sounds, uh, the apathy stuff sounds about as good as the stuff on  Fingers Metal Shop on WBAB. 
[00:41:00]  Oh, God.  Your old station, old co-worker.  Maybe he could send it in to Homegrown.  Homegrown.  That crappy feature.  Classic.  All right.  Here's the F.U. line.  Thanks for calling.  And here's the Opie and Anthony F.U. line.  Hey, this is a big F.U. to all the assholes that keep calling my house and waiting till  the message is done playing before you hang up.  If you hear the f***ing message, hang up the phone. 
[00:41:30]  F.U.  Next message.  Yeah, I need to send a big f*** you out to myself for driving without a license because  now I have to sit for three f***ing days in jail and spend $1,000 on an attorney when  all I had to do was sit my happy ass at home.  F*** you, me.  Next message.  Yeah, this is a big stinking f*** you to the f***ing jackhammer crew that's been working  outside my window for the past three days, starting at 7 in the f***ing morning. 
[00:42:00]  What kind of f*** is that?  I can't f***ing sleep because you have to pair up my f***ing street?  Give me a f***ing break.  F*** you.  Next message.  This is a big F.U. to all the parents that would take a little kid to the 10 o'clock show  with Spider-Man and then not drag little brat out of the theater when he starts crying.  They stink and I don't like them.  Thornton rules.  End of messages.  Trainwreck Radio.  Like a bunch of people cheering on a rink.  That's going to make a sweeper.  Oh, he's stung. 
[00:42:30]  Anthony.  Slime.  The O.P. and Anthony Show.  It's the O.P. and Anthony Show.  We've got to get five more contestants for the O.N.A. Money Snatch Game going down tomorrow  on the program before we hit the road because we're going to be in Philly on Thursday and  D.C. on Friday.  Can't wait.  We're going to have two fine parties.  One in Philly and one in D.C.  Ah, hell yeah.  Anthony, we need the Stalker Patty update.  Real fast, give the synopsis of what went on yesterday. 
[00:43:00]  Yesterday, Stalker Patty wanted to be involved in our Money Snatch Game because she is destitute.  She is broke.  She needs money for a place to live.  She pays $25 a week rent and her landlord said that if Patty is involved in this filth-ridden  event that we are running, that she will no longer be welcome to pay rent and live at  this house.  So we got the landlord on the phone, or the daughter of the landlord, some raggy bitch, 
[00:43:30]  and said, who the hell is she, piling her morality on Patty?  And to go F herself.  And Patty's an adult.  She can do whatever she wants.  She goes, well, she can do what she wants, but it ain't going to be here.  I'm throwing her stuff out on the lawn.  Bop, bop, bop, bop.  So we then offered Patty $906 to once again shave her head.  Shave her head again.  Cut her brand new mullet-ish type hairdo.  Cut it off. 
[00:44:00]  She gave that for us about eight months ago or so.  For the YouTube tickets.  Just starting to grow in.  Right.  It's just starting to look like something.  She's starting to look like a human again, kind of.  Six or seven months later.  So we're like, cut it off.  You look like Kreskin.  Yeah.  Cut it.  Big friggin' head.  Cut it off again.  And for $906, we were able to collect yesterday.  We ran out of time.  She said yes to the Let's Make a Deal segment.  And we ran out of time.  We had to run out of here right at seven yesterday.  And we don't really know what happened to Patty. 
[00:44:30]  Yeah.  She didn't want to go back to the house.  We were arguing with the sister or the daughter of her landlord for a half hour.  Patty called the house a bunch of times.  She was like, Patty who?  Patty who?  I don't know what Patty click.  Yeah.  With that voice.  Yeah.  Ugh.  So one of our faithful listeners, Joyce, took hold of the situation, Anthony.  Yeah.  Hey, Joyce.  What's going on?  Hi, guys.  How you doing?  Good.  You got the Stalker Patty update?  Yeah.  Well, after last night's tobacco with that horrible woman, I didn't want her to go back  to that house either.  And I kind of got scared. 
[00:45:00]  So I called Stinky and I said, Stinky, we've got to do something.  So I volunteered to take her back there, get some clothes.  Wait.  Stinky was involved?  Well, Stinky took the call.  Well, what do you want to do about it?  I don't care.  I need to smoke pot.  We could go get her high.  I don't care.  Hi, Joyce.  This is Garrett Stinky.  Awesome.  I'm awesome.  Yes, he is.  And why do I care?  We will find Patty an awesome place to live.  Well, at first he shrugged me off.  He said, oh, come on. 
[00:45:30]  She's going to be fine.  She'll be fine.  I was really concerned.  So I volunteered to take her home, get some things.  I didn't want her to go to that crazy woman's house by herself and bring her back to the  studio to stay overnight.  Then I thought about it and I said, you know what?  I'm not letting her stay in that studio.  So when I got there, she was on with Ron and Fez.  And then when she came out, when they went to break, I said, Patty, listen, I have a surprise  for you.  You're not going to stay in the studio tonight.  I got you two nights at a hotel right up the street here.  Oh, you did, did you?  Yeah.  Two nights. 
[00:46:00]  Two nights.  Last night and tonight she'll be there.  And I, and I just couldn't leave her there.  I, you know, the decent thing to do is to help out her and the show and to just try to bring  some calmness to the situation.  Hey, no room, no room service at this hotel, is there?  No.  Oh, no, no minibar, right?  No.  I got him.  Good.  And that's the last we've heard?  No, actually, I spoke to her this afternoon.  She called to tell me that she did go back there and that she was going to be meeting  with you guys later on to give you the whole thing of what went down over there when she 
[00:46:30]  did get there.  Oh, she went back?  She went back this morning.  Good.  She went back to Staten Island this morning.  Well, we'll hear from Patty a little later on.  She's supposed to come in to get her head shaved for $906.  That's right.  She is.  All right.  Uh-huh.  Well, Joyce, thank you so much.  Hey, thank you to you guys for her.  You know, I felt bad.  It was the right thing to do and I stepped in, so I'm glad I did.  I thought you were going to bring her back to your house.  No.  I'm too far.  I'm coming all the way in the Bronx.  She wants to go all the way over there?  Hell no.  That's not the reason. 
[00:47:00]  No one wants to go.  You got a little scared, didn't you?  Well, yeah.  She's like cockroaches.  Once you have them, there's no getting rid of them.  Right.  Sick.  Because this all started with Joyce going, hell, she could sleep in my place.  Next thing you know, she's putting her up in a hotel.  Yep, yep.  Nice and safe to step away from the situation.  All right.  Thank you, Joyce.  Take care.  All right.  Bye.  So I guess we'll hear from Patty with an update, Ant.  Yeah.  Good.  All right.  Nicole wants in on the ONA Money Snatch Game.  All right.  Nicole. 
[00:47:30]  Yes.  What's going on?  Not much.  You were on hold all day yesterday?  Well, no, actually.  I heard about the contest last week and I called in and actually emailed Rick and that's how he  just called me today.  So I called you guys back.  All right.  It's turning out we got a lot of prudes that listen to the Opie and Anthony show.  Yeah.  A lot of girls backing out.  Yeah.  I don't understand this.  Every girl seems to recognize the fact that they're going to be completely naked.  Right?  You know that? 
[00:48:00]  Mm-hmm.  Nicole?  Yeah.  You're fine with that?  Yeah.  I don't really have a problem.  I mean, it's just other girls and you guys.  Right.  Whatever.  I don't really care.  Well, it'll be Anthony and I because we got a comment on what's going on.  And that's why some of my questioning, Opie, is best left turned down.  I try to see just how prudish some of the girls are.  That's all I'm trying to do.  Yeah.  That's all.  So there are certain questions that are asked that just sees the mindset. 
[00:48:30]  That's all.  So, Nicole, you know the whole deal.  You come in tomorrow, a bunch of other naked girls.  You're running around for about five minutes trying to collect as much money as possible  that will be thrown all over the studio and hanging from the ceiling and stuff.  Right?  Mm-hmm.  Okay.  And there's another twist.  And Ann's going to explain that twist.  Yeah.  And if you're okay with this twist, we will add you to the list of names that will be joining us tomorrow.  Okay.  I got to tell you, man, a lot of prudes out there.  I know.  When we do stuff for girls, it's a nightmare because they always back out.  I know.  If we need ten guys for some crazy contest. 
[00:49:00]  We get 20.  We get 20 and they all show up.  Yeah.  We have to overbook just the...  They bring their friends, too, so we get the 40.  We get 40 or 50 guys.  It's hard to do that math.  We have to get like 30 girls to get five, basically.  Right.  Because they all back out.  So don't back out, Nicole.  I'll try not to.  And if you have an inkling of backing out, you've got to tell us so we can keep the spot open for somebody else.  And this goes for all the girls that are waiting on hold, right?  That's right.  All right.  Here we go.  So we'll explain the other twist of the O&A Money Snatch game. 
[00:49:30]  Okay.  Mm-hmm.  Yes.  You sound very scary.  Well, I'm covering the mic with my hands so that it doesn't bleed through to the other mics.  I have to talk very low.  You're using your Hello, Sydney.  Because we all can hear you, right?  Hello, Sydney.  Yeah, he's using that type of voice.  Go ahead.  And continues.  All right, hand.  You're bleeding through to all the other microphones.  Anthony is now talking to Nicole, giving her the other twist in the contest. 
[00:50:00]  Yes.  Mm-hmm.  Okay.  Excuse me?  You could say that.  It's getting to know Nicole.  Yeah.  I didn't realize that these are these kinds of questions, but...  Well, you know, it's just one of the few questions I asked. 
[00:50:30]  We just want to make sure you're not a prude and that you're not going to back out on us.  That's all.  No.  Ready?  Yeah.  Okay.  It's going to give her the twist, finally.  Mm-hmm.  What does that have to do with getting money from a studio?  See, I'm just asking a few preliminary questions.  What are you asking?  That, Nicole, actually, you are right.  They have nothing to do with this contest.  I'm just asking.  I'm just asking.  Yeah.  Okay. 
[00:51:00]  All right.  Dance mics back down.  Nicole, are you going to ever ask me the question, or are we just going to stay on  the phone until 7 o'clock?  Wow, Nicole, a little testy.  Am I ugly?  Oh, hey.  Whoa.  Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.  Hold on.  What's happening?  I ran out of music and...  You're wrecking this. 
[00:51:30]  And all of a sudden, what you were saying was bleeding through in the...  I know.  According to FCC regulations...  I can't say that.  You can't say that.  Turn that music a blouse.  All right.  All right.  Get back to Nicole here.  Mm-hmm.  No.  No.  I don't think that's any of your business.  Oh. 
[00:52:00]  Now, see, Obie, these are the type of questions I use to weed out some of the people before  I actually, Nicole, give you the twist.  Seems like...  And, uh, Nicole, a little testy, Nicole.  Yeah, I don't know what Anne's asking Nicole, but she seems a little, uh...  A little testy.  A little testy.  Let me just ask her a couple more things.  All right.  No, I'm being more like a bitch.  Why are you a bitch, Nicole? 
[00:52:30]  Why?  That's my...  No, no, no.  I understand.  Say, we want some fun girls for this contest.  I want to give you some fun.  Yeah?  Yeah, I just don't need these, uh, stupid...  Just ask me the question, and then I'll be there tomorrow.  All right.  Well, like I said, I just asked a few things.  I think she's going to give a...  I know.  It's your job.  It's okay.  To, um, you know, don't take them personally, uh, Nicole.  I know.  I know.  Please don't take any of this...  You guys can mess with me.  I'll mess with you.  All right.  Give her the twist, Anne.  All right.  Don't take it personally, though.  Here's the twist. 
[00:53:00]  Mm-hmm.  Mm-hmm.  Mm-hmm.  Mm-hmm, mm-hmm, mm-hmm, mm-hmm, mm-hmm, mm-hmm.  I don't know what's your problem.  Yeah?  I don't know.  Nicole, please.  I'm sorry.  I'm sorry.  I just want to see how you react to these things.  Please don't take it personally, okay?  No, I'm not.  All right.  You haven't described it quite that way with the other girls.  No.  Well, I'm sensing something from Nicole that I just want to weed out.  I want to be sure, Opie.  You want to be sure.  Okay.  Yeah.  All right. 
[00:53:30]  Have you asked her the twist?  Strangely enough, no.  No, not yet.  But I will.  I will.  You were just about to.  I'm just ready to.  Nicole, I'm sorry.  All right.  Answer mic back down.  Oh, my God.  It's a lot.  You already asked that question, smartass.  Damn it.  All right, Nicole.  Let me just ask you this.  All right.  Here we go.  Finally.  Dude.  Wait. 
[00:54:00]  Say that again.  Oh.  All of it?  All of it, Nicole.  Don't repeat anything I said.  But that is the twist.  Yes, that will be the twist.  Are you game?  Sure.  There's always time to learn new experiences, so.  Oh, really?  Wow.  Interesting.  Can I ask you guys a question?  Can I step in and throw her out of the contest?  Why? 
[00:54:30]  I don't like her attitude.  Jesus, Opie.  She's been fine throughout the interview process and everything.  We got some fun girls on the line.  I'm sensing a little bit of an attitude here.  Nicole, are you kidding?  No.  Hello.  You guys said you were just messing with me, and I'm just messing with you.  All right.  A little tit for tat, if I may say that.  Exactly.  Right.  I'm perfectly harmless.  It's up to you, Anthony.  Yes or no?  I'll answer in a unique way.  All right.  And wants his mic down again. 
[00:55:00]  Go ahead, Anthony.  Oh, boy.  Excuse me?  I'll be very upset because you just asked me a whole bunch of vulgar questions.  All right, Opie.  I don't think we should count her out.  I don't think so.  Nicole?  That's mean.  Yes.  We'll see you tomorrow for the O&A Money Snatch Games. 
[00:55:30]  Thank you very much.  Leave the attitude at home, though.  I will.  Hold on the line.  We need some info.  Sure.  We'd really like to have fun in this studio.  Yes.  So if you're going to have any type of attitude, then you've got to tell Rick you're not into  it, okay?  How old are you, Nicole?  21.  And do you drink?  Um, occasionally.  We'll change that.  All right.  Hold on the line, Nicole.  Okay.  I hope you're right about that one, Ann.  Look, we're in no position to throw out girls.  Please.  All right. 
[00:56:00]  We've got, like, three more spots left that we'll fill.  That got really bad.  That got really bad.  That we'll fill later on in the program.  All right?  The questioning was taking a horrible turn.  Tim, what's going on?  Yeah, what's going on, guys?  I've got to talk to you.  Yeah, go ahead.  About yesterday, with the retard thing.  Yeah.  I was waiting, waiting, waiting.  I got out of work late.  I worked for the EMS with the fire department. 
[00:56:30]  So I'm like, all right, good.  I can laugh.  So I'm going to the softball game.  Missed practice.  So I'm waiting for the retards.  But what do I have to hear about a depressed woman named Stalker Patty on Staten Island?  Whoever lives out here is depressed.  It's a Staten Island.  It sucks.  That was great radio.  We blew off the trainable audio for that.  That was a good call.  I thought it was a good call, but I'd rather have the retards first.  Then I went to Stalker Patty.  It would have laughed my ass off.  And I would have made softball.  We make command decisions here on a daily basis that cost thousands of lives. 
[00:57:00]  So that was one of them.  You know, I think we're going to play the audio next, Anthony.  Yeah.  I mean, come on, guys.  After 9-11, you've got to help some guys get from the fire department, you know?  All right.  We'll play it next for you, Tim.  All right.  Thanks a lot, guys.  We will.  All right.  All right.  You guys suck.  All right.  Thank you.  All right.  All right.  Bye.  Bye.  Ron from Philly.  Guaranteed.  Bar none.  No questions asked.  Bet the farm this chick will not show.  She will not show.  What are you saying?  The side bet going on.  Dump that bitch, Nicole.  Any chick who says none of your business is a cold ice queen who doesn't deserve to be 
[00:57:30]  in the contest.  Tell her she's out like a fat chicken dodgeball.  Don't let this bitch sea rag play F her, stupid whore.  I tried, but you said, you know, she's going to be okay.  I tried.  Yeah.  She is a big bitch.  Listen to her.  Tell her to put her mouth back on the sea.  All right.  Then, you know what?  Why don't we try one more here?  Amber.  Hi.  What's up?  You're not a bitch like the last one, are you?  No, I am not a bitch. 
[00:58:00]  Are you a fun gal, Amber?  I think I am.  All right.  You like getting naked with other women?  Well, that depends if Stalker Patty's going to be there.  I don't know if I want her rubbing up on me.  Well.  She's not going to be allowed in the contest because the listeners have decided that they  don't want to hear her in.  They don't want to hear her in the contest.  Oh, the voting's done?  Yeah.  Pretty much.  All right.  But you don't have a problem with being naked?  Not at all.  Because it goes further than that now, Amber.  All right.  I'm ready.  You're ready for the other two?  Nude with a bunch of other girls. 
[00:58:30]  Money all over the floor, the ceiling.  At least a thousand bucks.  Or the ceilings, as Opie likes to put it.  Shut up.  You had problems with the plural thing yesterday, too.  I certainly do.  All right.  It's going to be at least a thousand dollars, Ant.  Depending on how many girls we finally get, we're going to add more money.  Okay?  Right.  Okay, good.  Why don't you explain the other twist to Amber?  All right.  And all the money, by the way, we should say, will be given away tomorrow.  All of it.  Because whatever's left over will go to the girl that collected the most. 
[00:59:00]  The girl that collects the most actually wins all the money left on the floor.  The girls that do not win get to keep what they did gather up anyway.  There you go.  So everyone's a winner.  No one loses.  All right.  Why don't you explain the twist to Amber, Anthony?  Okay.  Hello, Amber.  How are you?  I'm upstairs, Amber.  Well.  All right. 
[00:59:30]  You'd be psyched for this?  Yeah.  Yeah.  A lot of fun.  Are you a sexually open-minded gal?  Yes, I am.  I would say so.  You like kittens.  I can't believe you just said that.  Uh-oh.  I'm appalled with myself. 
[01:00:00]  But I would have to say yes.  Ah, yes.  Am I sensing another attitude here, Anthony?  No, this is a good attitude she has.  Okay.  All right.  Continue with Amber.  All right.  All right.  Um...  Um...  Um, you ever take her?  Yes.  What are you asking her? 
[01:00:30]  What?  I like Amber's attitude.  I don't know what answer is asking Amber, but you sound fun today.  She's a trooper.  All right.  Are you going to get to the twist, Anthony?  Oh, yeah, I'm getting there.  I'm getting there.  All right.  Amber.  All right.  Yeah.  So far, you're doing very well.  Okay.  I just want to get a little more of a feel about how you'd be in certain situations.  Yeah, I already got a trooper. 
[01:01:00]  Oh, my God.  I heard that one in.  That has nothing to do with the twist.  Yes, it's not.  Well, not the twist per se, but it has to do with a certain attitude and open-minded spirit  that is the backbone of this competition.  You're taking advantage of this, aren't you?  Not at all.  These questions are based on some.  You're supposed to just get right to the twist with these girls.  No, no.  There's a whole, like, step procedure that I go through that kind of loosens up the applicant. 
[01:01:30]  You know what I mean.  Amber, yes or no?  Actually, I have to say no.  But, you know.  All right.  All right, Ann, your mic's back there.  I'm going to ask you.  I'm going to tell you the twist now, okay?  Okay.  Here it is.  All right.  All that money you collect.  Uh-huh.  Right? 
[01:02:00]  Uh-huh.  I knew that was the twist.  Don't repeat it.  I will not.  Don't repeat it.  I will not.  Now, knowing this now, Amber, and knowing the free-spirited gal that you are, are you in?  I would be more than willing to do this.  Oh, I think there's a but, though.  No, the only but I have is, is it possible?  Well, you know something?  Oh, it's possible.  We're all going to find out just how possible that is. 
[01:02:30]  That's right.  Well, I'll think about it tonight and try to figure it out.  But, I mean, I'm definitely in.  I'm definitely in.  I'm just going to try to think of the ways.  Amber, very good.  Think of the ways.  That's okay.  Yeah, that's up to you.  I have to come up with a strategy, you know?  Exactly.  We're hoping all the girls come up with a strategy because it's not as easy as it sounds.  And, Amber, you sound like a lot of fun, so don't back out on us, okay?  I will not back out.  All right.  Cool.  Hold on the line.  Rick's going to get information for tomorrow. 
[01:03:00]  All right, guys.  There we go.  The O&A Money Snatch Game going down tomorrow on the O.P. and Anthony Show.  Cool.  She was a lot of fun, Anthony.  There you go.  See, that's the kind of thing.  See, that's what I do, Opie.  I see if they're fun.  I see if there's a willingness to, you know, be a free spirit.  It's a special talent you have.  Thank you, Opie.  Thank you.  It's not only your voices.  It's not...  You have other special talents.  It's not always recognized, and I appreciate the recognition of some of my other talents. 
[01:03:30]  A lot of people saying, get rid of Nicole.  How did Nicole sound after she was off the air, Rick?  She sounded more up for it.  You know something?  No.  She is in.  We can't afford to lose any here.  How many contestants are we up to?  Knowing that a lot of these girls will end up blowing us off like they always do.  With Amber, we're up to nine.  Nine.  All right.  We're going to get a couple more girls just in case some of these girls drop out.  Hey, if all the girls show up, then we'll just add more cash to the situation.  All right, Ant?  All right.  Okay, when we come back, we've got two great audio clips from this trainable video. 
[01:04:00]  Yeah, a bunch of retards in certain sexual education situations.  It's been so long.  What are the two clips we're playing?  I believe we have one tard with his mother walking in on him in the bedroom as he was cranking it.  Many people believe that important elements of sex education...  See, we got them.  Many people believe that important...  Awful.  Yeah, she walks in. 
[01:04:30]  He's cranking it.  And instead of going, oh my God, what are you doing?  She turns into a robot and tells the kid that he's doing fine.  And that is perfectly normal.  Perfectly normal, yeah.  And what's the other clip?  The other clip, I believe...  Which one was that?  Hey, Frank.  Oh, okay.  That was the guy walking in on another guy, a retard.  No, no, no, no, no.  The guy looks like he's like a...  Drooling retard.  Retard.  Drooling retard.  Drooling retard.  And the guy looks kind of like a priest. 
[01:05:00]  He looked like a priest-type authority figure.  And a lot older.  Walks in and the...  Well, the drooling retard explains to him how he just had a wet dream.  In his own inimitable retard style.  And the older guy, right away, goes to pull the covers back.  Yeah.  Hey, Frank.  Hey, Frank.  Need a hand?  Hi, I'm Paul Shanley.  Can I help you out with that?  Boston reference.  Bing!  Ah, national reference.  This guy.  Yeah, true.  Everyone knows what a lovely guy he is. 
[01:05:30]  We'll play those clips next, right?  Right.  Hopefully, we'll get an update from Stalker Patty.  We got Sadie Allison, the sexpert.  She's coming in to tell the ladies how they could do a better job taking care of themselves.  Is this guys and girls?  Just the girls.  Just the girls, how they can take care of themselves better.  This is a syndicated radio show, right?  I do believe so, yeah.  All right.  And we also have Alex Carroll, the guy that does the speeding ticket thing.  Right.  All on the way on the Opie and Anthony Show.  Keep the 14-year-old away from us. 
[01:06:00]  Have a drink.  I want to bang you.  This is normal radio, right?  The Opie and Anthony Show.  I don't know whether to sit here and listen to you guys that drive down there and back their heads in with a baseball bat.  Here, check it out.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  Well, they know what killed Lane Staley, Anthony.  Speed Ball.  Wow, another one, huh?  Just like Belushi and River Phoenix, another one goes to the Speed Ball. 
[01:06:30]  Speed Ball.  Irwin and cocaine mixture.  I don't get that.  The up-down thing.  And they figured that he died on April 5th, Anthony.  And when did they find him?  Two weeks later.  Incidentally, April 5th was the same day Kurt Cobain died.  Wow.  So that's the official report.  There you go.  Lane Staley died of a Speed Ball overdose.  How will this affect the music of Apathy? 
[01:07:00]  And I noticed Tim Sabian is playing foosball during the breaks, Anthony.  Yeah.  Is he good?  You know something, Tim?  Not bad.  Not a bad player.  I smoked him.  Made him look silly.  He stinks.  He wasn't going much for the push shot.  I was playing front.  He's playing back.  So I'd line up the shot.  I'd do a little push and then slam that thing.  Bam! 
[01:07:30]  And he was pretty good at blocking that.  So once I saw that he could block that, but then he wasn't able to block anything else.  I'd do a pin shot where I'd pin the ball and pull and then slam it.  They had lightning fast.  He couldn't even see it.  He had no clue, right?  He felt stupid.  He felt stupid.  You know when the ball actually says hello down the other goal?  Yeah.  Where you slam it in so hard it goes, hey, how are you doing?  Hey, hi.  Like down at the other goal?  That's like that.  Very ugly.  I defy anybody to beat me.  And where is Tim?  He left?  He left a broken man. 
[01:08:00]  He actually said he was talking about me playing front, him playing goal, and he said we can make a lot of money.  So he's thinking I guess me and him are going to go out to the bars.  Is he that good?  And make some money.  He's pretty good.  Yeah.  He's pretty good.  He's in town because it's hard for me to judge, though, because I'm so good.  Here comes Tim Saban.  I'm so good that it's hard to judge.  You're very good, but I can play backs, you can play fronts, and we can take on the world.  I'm a little nervous.  If somebody of my caliber plays against us, and you know what happens, he's going to be shooting past you because it was pretty easy for me. 
[01:08:30]  But you guys are taking on Alex.  I pretty much figured out.  No, we had two people that never played before.  Well, that's true.  So I would have played backs, you play fronts.  Yeah.  You take on the world.  All right.  I'd be willing to do that.  Tim's in town.  The whole company's in town this week.  Everyone's in New York for the big infinity meetings that go on.  I don't know what happens.  I think they put the hoods on, paddle each other's asses.  I don't know what happens at these meetings.  It's like one of those fraternity things.  Oomboogly oogly.  And you smack them on the ass.  And then Tim's got to drop off one of the brand new GMs naked, like miles from their station. 
[01:09:00]  And they've got to find their way home.  Is that how it works?  Absolutely.  They turn them off with pizza.  Do you all wet your thumbs and do the elephant walk to Black Rock?  Ow!  Are you ready for us?  We're coming down to Philly Thursday.  We can't wait.  We're wrapped up.  Very excited.  Have you been promoting our contest?  Absolutely.  You sure?  Absolutely.  So we don't even have to talk about it, right?  We're going to be broadcasting from YSP Thursday, and a lot of people are going to be hanging  outside the station, right? 
[01:09:30]  At the market.  Right?  You took care of everything.  It's all hand.  Grand prize, a meet and greet with Kid Rock, an autographed guitar from Kid Rock, and front  row tickets to the show that night when we all go there after the show, right?  We're all excited.  And what do the listeners have to do?  They have to bring in the weirdest, wildest, nuttiest, unbelievable, craziest...  Right.  Whatever.  I don't know.  They bring in everything.  Spleens?  What?  No.  Right.  Boston brought us a spleen.  Or New York brought us cancer.  So we're wondering what Philly's going to bring us. 
[01:10:00]  Oh, I can tell you.  And we're doing the same thing in D.C. on Friday.  Yep.  For a whole nother prize.  A whole poison trip to L.A.  It's going to be great.  Okay.  Thank you, Tim.  Thank you, Tim.  We appreciate the support we get from you.  We would keep you...  Valley Fronts, I'm back.  All right, man.  We're going to take on the world.  Let's do it.  Make some money.  We keep...  Hell yeah.  We'd keep you on the show, but we realize you have nothing.  You...  You have nothing.  Dink.  All right, Anthony, we better get to the audio. 
[01:10:30]  Let's do this, finally.  We should get Sadie in here, at least.  Sadie Allison, the sexpert, and Alex Carroll.  We bumped them yesterday.  She was playing...  What are we, Letterman, all of a sudden?  I know.  We're bumping guests.  Bumping guests.  We don't get many guests, and we're bumping them.  She was playing goal for me against Tim Sabian.  The ball rarely got back there.  And Paul Mercurio coming by.  Oh, cool.  Alex, too.  Also, we're going to get a Stalker Patty update, hopefully.  Yep.  And, Anthony, we cannot find Steve-O.  I hope he's not dead. 
[01:11:00]  He called in a panic late in the show yesterday.  We didn't have time to talk to our new pal from Jackass.  Yep.  He was saying that he either smoked or snorted some special K, and he was out of his mind,  and he might be dying, and he had some news for us.  We will be reading about his death.  We will be.  There is no way a guy abuses himself physically like that, not even just the jackass-type stunts,  but with the drugs.  Yeah.  And I've never seen someone do so much cocaine since, like, the 80s. 
[01:11:30]  All the 80s.  Yeah.  Allegedly what?  Stop it.  It's not even play around here.  It was pretty out of control that day.  Yeah.  And then he was talking about circumcisions.  He had big news about circumcisions.  Something about circumcisions.  We had to get off the air.  Yeah.  So Rick is trying to hunt him down, and so far, no luck, right?  We're looking for him.  No luck whatsoever.  Okay.  We got two books in front of us, Speeding Excuses That Work,  The Cleverest Cop-Outs and Ticket Victories Ever by Alex Carroll, 
[01:12:00]  and then we got Sadie's book, which is much more interesting.  Don't worry.  You'll get your plugs.  Oh, boy.  I have ten of these already, Alex.  Your other book, Beat the Cops.  Yes.  You realize we're very friendly with the cops on this show.  I know.  And they get very pissed off every time we put you on our radio show.  They love it.  Oh, my God.  I was looking at Tickle Your Fancy, Sadie's book.  Sadie Allison.  And I thought this was the get-out-of-a-ticket thing, 
[01:12:30]  and I show an illustration of a woman holding open her parts.  Well, that'll work, too.  That works to get out of a ticket.  You know, you guys should combine books.  Who are you kidding?  Sure.  Wow, look at that.  Wow, you've got some nice drawings in yours, Sadie.  I'm looking at the illustrations.  It's almost like when you found the Joy of Sex books when you were a kid.  Yes.  Remember the drawings?  How hot?  Yes.  With the big, drawn-in, 70s Earth Mama mumps.  Yes.  All right, and Sadie Allison's book is, yeah,  Tickle Your Fancy, A Woman's Guide to Sexual Self-Pleasure. 
[01:13:00]  You know how special Sadie is on the Stinky Cam?  She is now replacing, when I hit start, the lovely Gloria Ann.  No, you can't replace Gloria Ann.  Look at Gloria Ann's picture.  We have Gloria Ann's picture.  Gloria Ann's naked, and Sadie's not.  You go to...  I don't need to be naked.  You go to...  You're hot and all, but that Gloria Ann is.  Foundrymusic.com, opieandanthony.com, plenty of Gloria Ann pictures. 
[01:13:30]  So here we go.  All right, so we got Sadie on the Stinky Cam.  No offense, Alex.  It's all right.  Yeah.  Show the ticket guy.  I want to see the ticket guy.  I want to see him take his top off.  Yeah, come on, man.  Come on, faggots.  Wow, this is...  Which book are you saying wow to?  You know, then good luck, Alex.  Probably not mine.  We are horrible, because I'm fixated on Tickle Your Fancy. 
[01:14:00]  You know, Anthony and I are professionals, though.  We're going to make this work.  It's all right.  You guys are going to...  You're going to leave the studio going, wow, they made this work.  Yeah.  You guys are going to do Sadie first, no pun intended, and then I'll get the back clean.  Pick your chin up.  We're going to get through this.  Well, on the back of Sadie's book, it says a how-to...  Well, we can't say the M word for pleasuring.  A how-to M word guide to women and curious men.  Learn more than 30 techniques.  That's right.  Look at this hot drawing of this woman.  She's on her bed, on her knees, completely naked. 
[01:14:30]  She's lighting a couple of candles on her little night tables.  And she's got like a stereo, so you know there's probably music going.  That's an old stereo.  Three naked.  Page 41.  Yeah.  Page 41.  And she's got a book there, and she's just going to go at herself.  That's right.  Create an environment to suit your mood and style.  Lying on your back with your legs slightly spread apart.  Relax and let your mind go.  Look at page 43, Opie.  Whoa, hey!  That's where she gets going.  That's where she goes to, huh?  Now she's going.  See the sequence?  All right.  Yeah. 
[01:15:00]  And guess who was posing for those?  Who?  You?  Oh, come on.  Look at the cover.  Look at the cover of the book, Anthony.  That's you on the cover?  Look at the cover, and look on the back.  On the left side there, in the red.  On the side there.  There you go, buddy.  Wow.  That's my breast.  Sadie is beautiful.  Oh, it is, isn't it?  And then it says, more than 60 diagrams and illustrations in the book, Anthony.  Become an expert at using fingers and sex toys.  Strengthen your sexual awareness and sex life.  It's got it all.  Ideal for newcomers or those with experienced hands. 
[01:15:30]  Hey, I got one here where you can use the washing machine.  Oh, yeah?  Sure.  Wait, lean up again?  Oh, you sit on the corner of it?  Yeah, you sit on it just like you sit on a Harley.  Yeah.  And loosen one of the legs.  Wait, where's the, uh...  Put a sneaker in there.  Uneven load.  Nice.  We like it bumpy.  Yeah.  Where's the washing machine?  Oh, and here's fun with the...  82.  I've heard about this bathtub faucet thing.  Mm-hmm.  Girls like getting in the bathtub, righto?  You get the water going, nice temperature, and then they just lay down with the vitals there 
[01:16:00]  right under the stream of water coming out of the tub.  I mean, they seem to like that.  That's pretty good.  It's one of the most popular ways women learn to self-pleasure because you don't need...  Yeah, a lot of the times, the only time that they have any private, personal time  is when they're in the bathroom.  Oh, you're talking about when they're first exploring and experimenting with their...  That, too.  Tell us more.  Tell us more.  But they're getting away from the busy household and all the children, and they escape to the  bathroom for those long showers.  Ah.  Uh-huh. 
[01:16:30]  Interesting.  It leaves an interesting bathtub ring, doesn't it?  See?  Yes.  And then there's the shower massager, which, you know, guys and girls have used this one.  I'm sure your first few experiences with a lot of guys have been the...  You know, you get that pulse on, let it slap your yam bag a little bit while you're just  cranking, right?  Yeah, to wash the undercarriage.  Yeah, sure.  Wait, Chris is very confused, Anthony.  We've got to go to the phones. 
[01:17:00]  Yes, Chris?  Hey, what's up, guys?  Hey.  I really wasn't listening.  Did you guys say I should pleasure myself in front of a cop to get out of a ticket?  That's your Christina note.  Wow.  Maybe we're confusing some people.  Well, I think...  I just got in the car.  I didn't know.  You know, who are you kidding?  I mean, what cop is giving a lady a ticket if he walks up to the window and sees that  going on?  Of course you were speeding.  I understand.  Only works for girls, huh?  Ladies.  If you're a guy and you're doing that when a cop comes up to the window... 
[01:17:30]  Did I say cop comes up to the window?  Actually, it might work.  I think a cop, if he came up to the window and you were doing that, he might be so scared  he might say, I'm out of here.  Yeah, I don't think so.  I think there'd be a lot more cops on the way.  Let me ask Alex and Sadie questions here, Anthony.  Alex, why should we buy your book?  Why should you buy my book?  Well, the story behind this book is, you guys know the story of Beat the Cops was a book  on how to get out of your ticket.  What we did with this one was we had a contest on the website. 
[01:18:00]  And Sadie, your book?  I'm teasing, of course.  No, we had a contest on the website and gave away a free copy of Beat the Cops every week  to the person who submitted the best ticket story or excuse.  They've got something in common here, Anthony.  Alex's book is Beat the Cops and Sadie's book is Beat the...  So it's a collection.  What we did is over the two years, we got over 1,500 stories and submissions from people  all across the country.  And these are excuses that they really used that got them out of the ticket.  So they're real stories from real people. 
[01:18:30]  And why should people buy this book?  Because what you'll do is you'll go through this book and you'll find like one, two, three  excuses.  You'll go, those are perfect for me.  I'll use those.  And next time you get pulled over, you'll be armed and ready.  It'll make the difference between you getting a $200 ticket and getting off of the warning  scot-free.  All right, it's not all about you, Alex.  Sadie, why should we...  Why should we...  You asked the question, I'm just answering.  Oh, it's cool.  Why should we buy your book, Sadie?  Tickle Your Fancy is all about how to please yourself, which is the basis of a good sex  life.  And it doesn't stop there. 
[01:19:00]  For women, if you know and give yourself permission to pleasure yourself and you learn  your body...  Yeah, that's right.  Women have hang-ups.  Like if you let that go and say, okay, I'm going to learn how to take responsibility for my own  orgasms, learn what I like, whether it's a different position.  Or different toys.  How I like to be touched.  You can then take that into the bedroom and share that with your lover and show him how  to touch you and how to do that for you.  Because you know what?  Because guys, they're fishing around in the dark.  They don't know.  You guys don't know what you're doing.  Fishing around. 
[01:19:30]  You know something?  Guys have such a bad rap, man.  There are some sexually inept guys out there ruining it for everybody.  But you know what, Anthony?  Where do you guys ever really learn when you're growing up how to please a woman?  From my mom.  Yeah.  Exactly.  Your mom and your dad aren't telling you.  You're listening to your guy friends in the bars.  Pornos, which isn't how we like doing it.  No.  So what I've done...  You don't like doing it like they do it in the pornos?  Oh, sometimes, yeah.  Of course.  You know how you learn?  You know how you learn?  You try something.  When it works, you stick with it.  That's right.  If it ain't working, you move on. 
[01:20:00]  And this is all supposed to be done at a very early age when you both don't quite know.  So that by the time you really get going and you're pretty sexually active, you kind of should know some of the basics.  You know what I mean?  That's right.  And so for the guys, what this is, this is the other team's playbook.  Yeah.  I put together in an easy-to-read guide with 30 techniques, everything guys need to know on how to please us.  What's your favorite technique?  My favorite technique is stroking the pleasure spot. 
[01:20:30]  Oh.  And that is an absolutely mandatory exercise.  Is there a diagram that I can follow here?  What page should we resort to?  Page 38, I believe.  30 what?  38.  38.  Ah.  Uh-huh.  Ah.  Oh.  Oh, wait.  I had Alex's book.  Page 38.  Yeah, something about radar detectors.  I don't think you want to use that.  This diagram looks like you're adding a little salt to your pot roast there.  You know how you kind of take a little between your... 
[01:21:00]  Oh, a little pinch?  Your thumb and your index.  Rolling between fingers.  You don't want to dial it like a combination knob on your locker, though, right?  Hey, dial the alphabet.  However, stroking circles.  I actually like it when you take three fingers side by side and you press down with a soft to medium pressure  and you go in circular...  Hey, I'm pretty good at this.  Place your thumb in the index finger, then gently squeeze, lift it, roll it.  What are we... 
[01:21:30]  And then the...  Making a joint?  It's almost like you're spanking it.  You're spanking the little guy.  That's on the next page.  Yeah.  Where is that?  Page 40.  Tapping.  Tapping.  Oh, no, I slap.  You slap.  This hand isn't drawn to scale on the parts, is it?  It looks a little big down there.  If that hand is...  You get the point, though, right?  No matter.  It's a tiny little hand.  All right, hold on.  There's a question, believe it or not, for Alex.  Anthony. 
[01:22:00]  Yeah.  Go ahead.  I got to go to a red light ticket.  I have to go to court tomorrow night.  I need to know how to get out of this.  Okay, you got three...  Well, here's the easiest strategy.  Are we okay jumping ship on top of this?  Yeah, you take your three fingers.  Yeah, you take your three fingers and, you know...  All right.  Come on, man.  Okay.  Don't kick him off.  So, no, here's the deal.  When you go to court on any ticket, the cop's supposed to show up.  And if the cop doesn't show up, you win because there's nobody there to testify against you.  But the cops are going to show up. 
[01:22:30]  Ah, but listen.  He has a constitutional right to confront and cross-examine his accuser.  His accuser is a camera.  All he has to do is demand to confront and cross-examine the camera.  The camera.  Hey, Anthony.  Oh, my bad.  My red light ticket.  Oh, no.  Can't pull me over.  Oh, I thought you got one of those red light camera tickets.  Oh, those are easy to get out of?  Yeah, those are totally easy to get out of.  Yeah, that's what we were just talking about.  Okay, so camera...  Red light tickets.  Yeah.  So, where was he? 
[01:23:00]  I guess around the corner somewhere.  Okay, so he was around the corner.  See, you were coming to the intersection.  Here's the law says...  The law says that if your car enters the intersection before the light turns red, you're free to go.  He was down a side street somewhere, right?  So how did he know whether the light was still yellow when you entered the intersection?  Ah, that's a good idea, man.  Yeah, that's all you got to do.  Ah, see?  Yeah, he just...  Thank you very much.  You're welcome.  All right, later.  Let us know if it works. 
[01:23:30]  All right.  All right, bye.  All right, peace.  You want to know where to touch his chick?  I got two people here, please.  See, now we got the Philly cop.  Demetrius, go ahead.  Hey, Opie and Anthony, you guys rule.  All right, what's up?  You guys, if someone in Philadelphia, if I stop one of those guys, that book is useless.  Their ass is grass.  I don't care if a chick is going at it, she'll sign that ticket with her sticky fingers and  I can smell that thing for the rest of the day.  Really?  She's done.  That book is useless in Philadelphia. 
[01:24:00]  Even if she's going to town when you get up to the car, you're giving her a ticket?  You're damn right.  Now, why can't girls pleasure themselves in Philly?  Hey, they can do it all they want.  They still get a ticket.  Oh, that book.  You people with your potty mouths.  All right, thank you.  All right, later.  And where did you want me to go?  I did?  Yeah, you said there was someone that wants to know how to...  All right, well, we'll try Joe, I guess.  Joe, you're on the O.P. and Anthony show. 
[01:24:30]  What's up?  Oh, hey, dude.  Okay.  And it doesn't go over too well, you know, with me too much.  He doesn't like going to that area.  What are your thoughts about oral on the, let's just say the balloon notch.  The back door area.  Right.  Yeah, yeah.  And your wife's into that, huh, Joe?  Yeah, man.  And how old is she?  She's 28.  Oof.  What, are there problems down there?  No, no. 
[01:25:00]  It's a decent area.  So dig in, get a good one.  I think you're missing the boat.  I mean, with...  The little man in the boat?  Is she clean?  Well, yeah, that's an area too.  But the lady married you, and she's stuck with you for the rest of her life.  I think you need to open up and give her what she wants.  You don't jab that tongue.  I've got to open up.  You don't jab that tongue, and she's going to find someone else that does, my friend.  Right, right.  Well, she hasn't asked, said to me, like, I want to, you know, I want to do it to you 
[01:25:30]  now.  So I'm lucky to...  No, no, that...  Hey, it's a give and take.  It's a give and take.  You know something?  No, no, that is a give, give situation.  There's no reciprocation on the girl doing that to the guy.  That's fun.  If you want to say to your chick, you know, hey, if you like that, whatever, you're getting  in the mood, maybe suggest you both get in the shower.  Is there like an apparatus?  Then grab a goddamn scrub brush and clean it. 
[01:26:00]  One of those wire scrub brushes.  Clean it like you're with a wire brush, like you're cleaning a burnt-on pan.  Right.  Until everything's nice and clean.  And then you can...  Oh, or buy one of those mechanical tongs, shut the lights out, and let it rip.  It is nice.  You guys are awesome.  But the bottom line is, is you guys are together, and I'm sure there's things that you...  You like that, Sadie, that whole action on the back portion of your body there?  Sure.  You don't mind that? 
[01:26:30]  Yeah, I'm saying.  But would you do it to a guy?  Yes.  A guy, it's a little different.  Oh, boy.  You know what I mean?  You're in the shower, you're clean, it's all about pleasuring each other.  Yeah, but even clean, guys are filthy.  It's just disgusting.  Not my men.  No, you know what I mean.  Guys don't pay attention to that area.  It's just hair or something.  It's just a mess.  It ought to just be...  You know, everything, I think everywhere the tongue is going to venture should be pretty 
[01:27:00]  devoid of hair.  I don't mean a roundy, like, you know, if a girl doesn't want to completely shave, that's  fine.  You can dig right in.  But that area should be like a waxed floor.  You know what I mean?  Smooth as silk.  But you're talking to a guy.  It's like, goddamn Amazonian jungle.  Ugh.  Piranha.  These old Taco Bell rappers in there.  Oh, God.  But as Rick is pointing out, if you do that to the cop, you'll definitely get out of the  ticket. 
[01:27:30]  Right?  So, maybe we can...  I don't know.  It just seems like, well, whatever you're into, you know.  David, what's up?  Yeah, how you guys doing?  Listen, I'm calling out...  All right, hold on.  Hold on, David, because you know something?  I read what you want to say, and if you say it like that, we're going to have to dump  out until next week.  Yeah, because we are...  I hear you.  I know about the little man in the boat.  That's where I'm going.  We're responsible broadcasters here.  I understand, and I respect that.  Okay.  But, no, every time I... 
[01:28:00]  Let's say...  Yeah.  See, that part won't make it through.  You're mentioning a bodily function thing.  Yeah, see, that part put us over the top there.  Yeah.  Oh.  David, watch how Anthony explains this.  Okay, please.  What you're saying, David, is every time, and you said it fine the first time, you put  your tongue right on the little man in the boat?  Yes.  Um, the girl will, uh, I don't know, she'll, she'll, uh, expel some, um, uh, uh, yellow 
[01:28:30]  discipline.  Okay.  What do you have to do about that?  See, now you said that, and now you clued everyone into what Anthony said.  Yeah, see, that was such a fine line that we don't walk.  Wait, wait, wait, one more thing.  Yeah.  Nope.  All right.  He didn't get me, he got Opie.  No, then he was coming back, Anthony.  No, he wasn't.  Yes, he was.  He got you.  I was not gotten, you were gotten.  Sadie, anything on that?  That's, that's a unique end with an orgasm.  Yes. 
[01:29:00]  Um, sounds like she just dispels it when he goes down there, and, um, I would just say  have her lay on her back, and, uh, hopefully they'll just go downward.  He did say he's a brother, maybe it's the knife to her throat.  Oh, stop.  See, you don't want to laugh at that, because it's very politically incorrect.  I suggest the guy gets a pail.  Mike, what's up?  What's up?  My two favorite crackers.  Kind of like, kind of like when the ceiling's leaking there, Anthony, you, you get the pails  and you put them all over your living room to catch the rainwater. 
[01:29:30]  Yeah.  What the hell?  Mike, my brother, what's up?  What's up, my two favorite crackers.  What's going on now?  Hanging.  What up, Mike?  All right.  Well, you know, the brothers like that, uh, uh, balloon knock, uh, pleasure, I don't  want to say it wrong.  You like the nice, the big ass.  If not, no, you can't do it with a sister, because a shorty with a 40 will kill you.  A shorty with a 40 will kill you.  You'll get killed up in a suffocation.  You've got to do it with the white girl up.  Oh, you're talking about going, uh, to the, uh, the, uh, back, uh, door of the balloon 
[01:30:00]  knot, going to the forbidden zone.  Wow.  Yeah, because of the 40 star rump, shaping that rump, you all done.  It's over.  You've got to just call the paramedics.  It's over, brother.  He doesn't want to suffocate.  Well, uh, hey, my shorty got a nice 40, but I ain't doing it to her, because I will  get killed.  The brothers like going to the forbidden zone with their, uh, forbidden zone.  Look, look, all that other stuff is punk.  You a punk if you, you know, you just do the, the, the V.  Right.  If you get the OT, it's all coochie. 
[01:30:30]  You know what I'm saying?  All right.  Yeah.  You know what I'm saying?  She'll be cooking you dinner all week.  You want to, you want to look at the whites of those eyes when they just turn around  and look at you.  That's right.  And they got to turn way around.  And look over hills and valleys and mountains and streams.  Give you that look.  Maybe they got to make, make that funny face.  Especially the streams part.  They got to make that funny face like, man, you're not going away back there.  That's right.  Sure.  If you're doing it right, it's like looking at deer with the headlights coming.  Put them on a tube.  They start reaching for stuff that ain't there. 
[01:31:00]  It's all good.  I got you.  I hear you, Mike.  All right.  All right, partners.  Peace.  There goes Mike.  Let's go to Chad.  Chad, what's up?  Hey, what's up, boys?  Hey.  I have a question for Alex, actually.  What's up, Chad?  I got way too many speeding tickets in a row, and I ended up losing my license, right?  Right.  Now, on May 10th, I have a court date for aggravated unlicensed operation.  The cop caught me when I was driving without the license, right?  Right.  What should I do?  Well, in this particular situation, what you want to do is you want to – I would go in 
[01:31:30]  and explain to the judge that you needed to travel back and forth to work and or to school,  and you can normally get a provisional license once you lose your license to go back and forth  to work and school, and just say that you weren't aware of it, and you just found out  about it, and you need to get that taken care of, and that's probably all it's going to take.  So you're basically hoping the judge has a heart.  Yeah, well, I mean, in this particular case, though, I mean, when somebody screws up,  they give them a provisional license so they can still get to work, and you can just say  you didn't know about that, you just found out about it, and you need to get that taken 
[01:32:00]  care of.  All right.  I actually do have to go to school, though, and what are the possible repercussions of  this?  Am I going to jail or something if they decide?  No, you're not going to jail.  Just be cool.  All right.  Thanks a lot.  I'll take it to the Black Mountain Marauders.  All right.  If you do go to jail, you might want to tickle your fancy.  Is there a chapter in here, fun in the weight room?  No?  How to be a good bitch in the weight room?  No?  Cab driver Ricky, what's up? 
[01:32:30]  Hey, what's happening, ONA?  Check it out, man.  Back in the day, I went to the forbidden zone for the first time in the back of a movie theater,  yo, and I had on all white, and the crap got all over my clothes.  Wait, wait.  So he's in the movie theater, wearing all white, he went to the balloon knot, and for  some reason, he had the stuff all over his clothes, and you walked out back in the day,  yo.  Did you look like you worked for Ups after you were done? 
[01:33:00]  Well, yo, I mean, yo.  Dude, I got fired, too.  Because I worked there.  So you should have walked up to the concession and go, why y'all sell me melted raisin in?  Actually, I ran out in the lobby screaming and hollering just to do it, just to be fooling  around.  So you don't mind the forbidden zone there, Rick?  Yeah, I don't mind the forbidden zone.  You know, as a grown man, you know, I kind of, you know, kiss it. 
[01:33:30]  Yeah, there you go.  And I let the chicks kiss it, too, and I find their face.  So, hey.  All right, all right.  Come on.  Thank you.  Give me the call, yo.  All right.  Sadie, what would you say a guy's biggest mistake or misconception is with the female  anatomy and what makes it tick?  What makes it tick?  It's actually the pleasure spot, the little man in the boat.  Really?  Guys still don't know where the hell that is?  Are you kidding me?  Well, the biggest misconception is that it's all about, um...  Right, the, uh, right, right.  Well, we understand, yeah, yeah. 
[01:34:00]  It's all about the coming together with the two organs, but really, if a guy pays attention  to the actual pleasure spot, it's always, almost always required that that gets attention  for her to even orgasm.  Right.  So, if you study...  You guys don't know that.  A lot of them don't know that.  They think it's all about getting hot and heavy and going all night and down.  Right, just slamming.  Oh, no, no.  You dopes.  It's all about foreplay and touching and caressing.  And the G-spot.  And the G-spot.  If you look at page 69, I have a great...  Oh, is that a consequence of the G-spot? 
[01:34:30]  It just turned out that way.  Consequence.  Hey, that's where the G-spot is.  It's right there.  I know.  Great illustration.  We learned that a long time ago, because you do the come hither thing with your hand.  Yeah, come here.  And you're all set.  And this right here is a G-spot toy.  Oh.  Are you going to be trying...  Wow, look at that.  Looks like a three would.  It does.  It's blue.  It looks like a little wand with an egg-shaped thing on the end.  And it's kind of bent.  Yeah.  That's how you locate the soap.  You go... 
[01:35:00]  And I actually brought a pal.  I can show you guys.  Whoa.  What the hell is that?  That is a pocket...  That's a...  Poo-ha!  That's a vagina.  It's ghetto.  That's what it is.  This is where you rub.  Right.  Wait, let me see.  Has it got authentic...  God, I wish I learned about sex from you.  We didn't get the...  Hey, it's not too late, Opie.  Give it a little feel.  We didn't get toys.  Wait, there's a...  You can't...  You can't, you know...  There's an entrance.  Go ahead.  Look at the back of it.  Oh, I see.  Oh, okay.  You don't know who's been using that. 
[01:35:30]  No, no.  It's brand new.  It's brand new.  It's up for grabs.  Wow, that is brand new.  It's right off the assembly line.  It's virgin.  Still has a hymen.  Interesting.  I'm not used to seeing one that looks like this.  Take a look, see?  And the neat thing about locating the G-spot...  And I was confused.  I didn't see an entryway.  Oh, but there is an entryway.  There is.  Look, just...  Ah, see?  It's just...  Demonstrate with the wand. 
[01:36:00]  Yeah, let's see how that works.  All right, let me get it lubed up.  Ah.  All right, while she does that, Anthony...  Yeah.  While Sadie does that, let's go to Pete.  Pete, what's up?  Yo, what's happening, man?  I got a question for this guy.  All right.  I got three DWIs in the past, but I got to keep driving to work.  We're away from Suffolk to Queens.  What can happen to me?  Well, first of all, you need to stop drinking and driving, dude.  Well, yeah, I've already done that.  And second of all, you're going to need to go to court and get on your knees and plead to the judge and say, 
[01:36:30]  you know, can I get a provisional license that allows me to get to work?  And, you know, hope he's in a good mood that day.  Either that or we got some stuff here for you.  What's that?  Yeah, some toys.  Cold Astro Glide.  Yeah, right, right.  Hey, don't F around no more.  You go to jail.  You might want to get the Astro Glide all set, because you're going to get a lot from the judge.  Loop him up.  He's going to F you bad.  All right, thank you, Pete.  All right.  All right. 
[01:37:00]  All right, should we take a break while you can prepare the...  It looks like it's ready to go.  She's preparing the demonstration, Anthony.  I'm just reading the book.  Yeah, well, we got Sadie Allison in here, a sexpert.  Her book's called Tickle Your Fancy, A Woman's Guide to Sexual Self-Pleasure.  And then we have Alice Carroll over there with his new book, Speeding Excuses That Work,  getting out all those tickets that we all get.  I like the one I read quickly about you kind of scratch the inside of your nose with your fingernail to make it bleed.  Yeah, some chick actually, she always got...  Her friend, actually, she was in college, and she says, you know, my friend was always getting out of tickets. 
[01:37:30]  She said, she always speed.  And I finally asked her, I said, you know, how do you do it?  And she says, oh, when I get stopped, I always just stick my fingernail out my nose and poke it until it bleeds.  And when the cop comes to the window, I just tell him, I'm so sorry, I was rushing to get some Kleenex.  And she said most of the time they run back to the car and you give her a box of Kleenex and she never gets a ticket.  That's pretty good.  That's pretty gross, but it's pretty good.  He once taught us, too, I think you could, like, pour water on your crotch and take some Hershey's syrup and squirt it all over the windshield. 
[01:38:00]  No, there's a guy that carries a bottle of water with him around everywhere he goes.  And every time he gets stopped, he just dumps it in his lap and he tells the cop he's got bladder problems.  Pretty degrading, but he saves himself some money.  Hey, he's gotten out of three tickets, so...  I've got bladder problems.  So be it.  I wet myself.  All right, we're going to take a break.  We'll get the demonstration going next.  Also, Anthony, no one's going to believe me at this point.  You're a lying sack of crap.  We've got two audio clips of Trainables.  And, you know, this would be a good spot to play this, because maybe Sadie could give us some...  A little helpful hints? 
[01:38:30]  Eh.  On the retarded?  Yeah.  Do you understand how the retarded...  Explain it.  We've got two clips of one of a retard...  Of a mentally handicapped, Opie.  That's the politically correct term.  Don't just...  You're talking like you're in the 50s or 60s.  But they're tards.  No, no, they're mentally challenged.  Watermelon heads.  No, mentally challenged.  And the video that we have is from the... 
[01:39:00]  Looks like the late 60s, early 70s.  Okay.  And they're kind of training these mentally challenged people on sex and self-pleasuring and sexuality.  It's very interesting.  Basically a couple of Boces spanking it.  A Boce.  I haven't heard that one in years.  Well, the mother catches the kid self-pleasuring.  Yeah.  What do you do?  You know, you're a parent.  You walk in on your kid jacking it.  All you could do is take them in the room and explain to them what it is. 
[01:39:30]  No.  Oh, okay.  Sorry.  A little odd.  This lady explains, but she turns into a robot because she's horrified.  Take them to the clergy so the clergy could finish off.  Right?  And then we got the wet dream.  Yeah.  Audio clip.  How to explain a wet dream to a tard.  To a drooling mentally handicapped.  Please.  Mentally challenged.  They're handicapable.  You guys aren't going to believe us, but we will play the clips next with Sadie Allison.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  It's usually just a bunch of guys sweating and burping and farting. 
[01:40:00]  Hail for the kings of the radio.  And we're back with the Opie and Anthony Show.  Lots going on.  Jay Moore on hold, Anthony.  Stalker Patty outside the studio.  Oh, thank God.  We have Casey.  She's been hanging out for like two and a half hours on hold.  Casey.  Yes.  Why are you calling?  I want to be in the money snatch.  Oh.  The O&A money snatch game we're doing tomorrow?  Yep.  Could you hold on just a little longer?  Yeah. 
[01:40:30]  Okay.  We'll go to you next when we're trying to find the next contestant.  So stay there.  Okay.  And then we've got the trainable audio clips that we've got to play right now where they're  going to kill us, Anthony.  Absolutely.  Sadie Allison's in studio, the sexpert.  And Alex Carroll, the speeding expert.  Right.  Teach you how to get out of tickets.  More than speeding expert.  Yeah.  All traffic tickets.  Yeah.  We have a detective saying that you're full of S.  Yeah.  I'm sure you've heard this before.  I hear it all the time.  John, New York detective.  What's going on?  Hey, guys.  How's it going, man?  All right.  Listen, number one, if a police officer doesn't show up in court once, the case gets rescheduled. 
[01:41:00]  We make arrests.  We get caught.  We have vacations.  So when he says that, he's wrong.  Second, telling that guy who was arrested for aggravated, unlicensed operator, if he  goes into the judge and says, oh, I was on my way to school, I was on my way to work,  he's going to get found guilty and he's going to be fine because when his license was suspended,  he was given a form to fill out that he should have mailed in and it would have given him  a restricted use license.  This guy's giving general information that the average cop, as long as he establishes 
[01:41:30]  a prime official case in court, he's going to win.  And this guy's trying to sell his book and make money with people and they're going to  waste their time.  Are you a judge?  Am I a judge?  Are you a judge?  No, but I'm a police officer with 16 years.  You're not the one making the decisions up there, dude.  And you're not a police officer that ever wrote a sentence that had to go to traffic  court.  So what do you know?  You're not a judge.  That's right.  You're not making the decisions.  And I have the experience.  You don't want to hear it, Alex, because you want to make money off the people. 
[01:42:00]  You're wrong.  You're wrong.  You just want to make money off the people.  You're not a judge.  If he goes in there and explains to the judge, your honor, I didn't realize that I had a  provisional license available to him.  It's up to the judge.  It's not up to you and you don't know what the hell you're talking about.  And the judge will say when his license was suspended, he was given a form to fill out.  You're not the judge and you're not the one going to be making the decisions.  And I have the experience making arrests.  You just whip people off.  You're just whipping people off.  You're making money off people's agony.  That's it.  You're wrong. 
[01:42:30]  Show me some people that won with some of these.  All right.  Show up once in court.  The cop ain't there.  You lose.  Yeah, well, you're certainly not going to share your opinions, pal.  Yeah.  And my opinion is your book's whipping people off.  You're screwing people.  I've got some of these.  And you've got no proof that this works.  Whatever.  Yeah, whatever.  I actually want to say that because you want people to play your book.  You're not the judge, okay?  You're not the one making the decision.  With 16 years of experience, you have zero law enforcement.  Zero.  You don't know what you're talking about.  I've been in court. 
[01:43:00]  I've testified and I've won with people that use your excuses.  They're not going to work.  Show me people that have won.  Nobody.  You've got nobody.  You've got excuses that don't win.  I've got a whole effing book full of them, dude.  Yeah, a whole effing book.  Yeah, yeah.  You know, Alex, tell you what.  Coming to New York City, I'll write you a ticket and try and beat it with your jerk-off excuses  because you'll lose.  Yeah, whatever.  You have zero law enforcement.  Wow.  All right, John.  Zero law enforcement.  Good job, John.  Yeah, I'll say, cut me off.  You want me to sell them?  You want to sell them?  I'll cut me off.  John, we gave you a fair enough chance. 
[01:43:30]  We're just going to move on with the show.  That's all.  Oh, okay.  You guys have a good night.  You rock, man.  You did great.  John, the detective there.  All right?  Thank you.  All right.  Wow.  Well, you get that all the time.  We had to put them through.  Cops get very pissed off when they hear you on the radio.  You know, it's funny because I get some cops that come up and call up and react like that,  and then I get lots of cops.  I had a cop call up on a show I was doing the other day, and he called up and he goes,  he's like, I'm so glad you're doing what you're doing. 
[01:44:00]  He says, you know, most of us cops out there, we just get really PO'd that they're just using us as revenue generators,  tax collectors with badges, and most of us just get really irritated about it,  and we're glad you're helping people out.  I got a buddy on my local force who says, you know, Alex, he says, one of these days,  we're going to have to go do a ride-along together, and I'll go up to the driver's side, write the ticket,  you go up to the passenger's side, sell the book, and we'll split the profit.  So, hey, whatever.  You know, if you want to get all bent out of shape and take them personally, it ain't my problem.  I'm just trying to help the people out there who got tickets that they don't deserve. 
[01:44:30]  I was taken a little personally.  Yeah, he seriously was having a problem.  All right.  Glenn, what's going on?  Hey, how you doing, guys?  Good.  I got a ticket while I was on the Northern State Parkway.  I was on my cell phone.  How do I get out of that?  That was after the law was passed, huh?  It was Saturday night.  Yeah.  Well, I don't know.  I mean, you might want to just go into the judge and say,  Your Honor, I didn't realize that the law had recently been passed.  I'm sorry.  I won't do it again.  Bring the receipt in and show him that you got the wireless thing installed in the car 
[01:45:00]  and see if he'll give you a break.  Might be worth a shot.  Yeah, I'm actually doing it now.  I'm just trying to...  Yeah.  Bring the receipt in with you.  That'll, like, show him that you really do, you know, you really were mistaken  and you got it taken care of and you got, you know, the best of intentions.  And it might work.  Thanks a lot, guys.  All right, Glenn.  Thank you.  I think that seems so hard to enforce.  You just say...  It's a tough one.  I wasn't.  I wasn't talking on it.  And then they say, You are.  No.  Yeah, you don't want to do that.  I was holding it.  Yeah, you don't want to do that. 
[01:45:30]  I was hungry and it was a candy bar.  You don't want to do the Your Word Against the Cops, though, because usually that doesn't  work.  Yeah, it doesn't.  Well, Anthony, we got two great audio clips.  Yeah.  So where do we go with this?  Well, we have to...  We got to start with the Wet Dream one.  You want to do that one first?  Yeah.  I also found a couple more tunes from...  Apathy?  Apathy, the Pipe Bombers band.  Awful stuff.  Yeah.  Horrid.  All right, so you brought in this instructional video.  Yeah.  And there was a section on there about trainables. 
[01:46:00]  How to talk about sex to...  That's what they called them back in the day.  To the slow people.  Right.  Retards.  The retarded.  Whatever you want to call.  Right.  But it was made back in the days when they didn't really care about being politically correct.  You know what I mean?  Mm-hmm.  So one woman walks in on her son, Jackin, and kind of explains to him that it's okay.  Well, that's the other one. 
[01:46:30]  Yeah.  And then there's another one.  This is the one we're going to play.  The one we're going to play is...  I don't know who this guy is.  He's a lot older.  He looks like he runs some type of maybe...  A home for these people?  A home for the Tards.  Okay.  And he walks in...  Maybe this particular Tard was kind of tossed aside.  You think?  Into one of these places.  Well, he walks in...  Because it wasn't like a father or an uncle or something.  No.  No.  Walks in, and the kid's all sweating.  It's a big, greasy mess. 
[01:47:00]  And he's in bed.  And the guy asked the kid what the problem is.  Right.  And the kid tells him.  And apparently he had a wet dream.  Right.  This is how they explain what to do about that.  Hey, Frank.  How come you haven't gotten up yet?  I'm wet and sticky.  I'm wet and sticky.  He woke up.  He's a little confused.  The poor little guy.  He doesn't know what the F just happened.  He don't know what happened.  All he knows is, uh... 
[01:47:30]  Felt great.  And he woke up wet and sticky.  And what the hell do you do now?  Hey, Frank.  How come you haven't gotten up yet?  I'm wet and sticky.  Oh.  What, uh...  When did that happen?  Did it happen during the night?  Or did it just happen now?  Do you know?  No.  No.  Well, if you're sticky, maybe it was a wet dream.  Do you know what a wet dream is?  No.  Well, you know...  How old are you now?  You're... 
[01:48:00]  You must be about, uh...  That's the musical interlude.  As, uh...  I guess he's talking to him about it.  You know?  Explaining what...  Occurred.  The counselor shows a calm, accepting approach to this boy.  Yeah.  Who has just had a wet dream.  There is no scolding or recrimination.  No.  The boy is not frightened.  And there is no reason for him to feel guilty.  Frank, I'm sure you understand now just what happened.  And, uh...  That this is probably going to happen quite a few times more. 
[01:48:30]  Like it does to everybody else.  And it's quite normal, right?  I think the best thing we can do now is to show you how to clean it up.  Okay.  Oh.  And then he starts pulling the blanket back on the kid.  He's going to help him clean up.  Oh, God.  And God knows how long it's been there.  It looks like mashed potato flakes on his stomach.  You know what I'm talking about.  Calamine lotion. 
[01:49:00]  Yeah.  Just when you start getting used to those things, they go away.  God damn it.  Remember just waking up and go, oh, oh.  Hey, that was cool.  Oh.  That was a nice ride.  Guiltless sex and not worrying about any STDs or pregnancy.  Nothing.  You wake up.  You're wet.  I'm sticky.  That's all you got to worry about.  Cleaning up the mess.  Well, the next clip is priceless, Anthony.  The mom walks in on one of these kids.  Yeah.  And he's in the middle of doing what little boys do best. 
[01:49:30]  And she, from what it appears, the way she sounds, it sounds like she had a in-case-your-son's-jacking-it-break-glass thing with these words behind it.  Because this is, doesn't sound like a very spontaneous speech.  No.  Sounds like something she'd rehearsed a few times.  Yeah.  So, let's play this audio.  Many people believe that important elements of sex education are social behavior and responsibilities.  Social acceptability involves being comfortable with one's own sexuality. 
[01:50:00]  Yeah.  Spanking it.  Kid's just jacking.  Yeah, the video is...  Door flies open.  Out of nowhere.  They show the doorknob first.  Right.  And the kid's just jacking.  Doorknob's moving.  Door opens.  Oh, no.  The mother looks on the bed and, oh, my God, there's our little boy.  Cranking it.  Oh, excuse me, Ricky.  Ricky, I did see what you were doing.  It felt good, didn't it? 
[01:50:30]  It's all right.  We all have feelings like this sometimes.  Yeah.  I'm just glad you're doing this in the privacy of your own room.  When you're a little bit older, we'll have to talk more about these feelings and what causes them and how we can control these feelings.  I'm sorry I intruded on your privacy.  I'll be sure to knock next time.  Okay?  That's right, bitch.  Now, let me get back to Cranking.  This manner of response frees the child of guilt 
[01:51:00]  and assures him he is normal.  It opens communication between parent and child  and introduces the concept of responsibility for his behavior.  Please.  It's a boner killer if there ever was one.  No doubt.  Oh, like the kid's just going to be able to take up where he left off?  He's having a great jack.  And then mom walks in and gives you that speech.  Not enough to make you feel pretty goddamn icky if you ask me.  The reality is my mom would have had a nervous breakdown. 
[01:51:30]  Really?  She would have ran out of the room screaming.  I jacked like a rabbit.  Didn't your mom catch you, though?  Never got caught.  Never got caught.  How the hell do you get caught?  First of all, the retarded kid's laying there cranking it.  He leaves his door right there where if he opens it up,  or if his mom opens it up, he's in plain view.  Jack him.  Do something.  Put a little something in the door.  Lock it.  I don't know.  If he doesn't have a lock,  do the laying on your side face in the wall, 
[01:52:00]  a knock-home-alone jerk.  Toss it in the pillow.  Hey, Jay.  That's that quag.  What's up?  Hey, Jay Moore, everyone.  I've been caught.  Have you?  Oh, yeah.  It was humiliating.  By who?  Your wife?  Don't you remember?  No.  No.  I was like, first of all, hello, gentlemen.  Hello, Jay Moore.  I got great news for you tonight.  You might remember him from the gay rodeo skit on more sports. 
[01:52:30]  Jay, hysterical.  Hysterical.  It's good stuff.  Thanks, guys.  That was so goddamn funny.  Man, I never knew you were so open-minded, let's say.  You're so liberal.  When the guy blindfolded me and spanked me with a paddle.  Not as bad as you, shirtless, with your arms above your head,  with two gay guys rubbing suntan lotion on your body,  on those tight abs of yours, Jay.  Anthony, the sun was, you know, Southern California sun.  It was very hot.  The last thing you want to do on a field remote is come home sunburned. 
[01:53:00]  Sunburned.  Yeah, so I have two flaming gay guys rub the lotion on it.  What am I going to do, look around for straight guys?  It's the gay rodeo, for crying out loud.  It rubs the lotion on its skin, or else it gets the hose again.  And then you teamed up with a gay guy to put underpants on, what, a goat or something?  On a goat.  Yeah, it was madness.  And you know what?  Sadly, we did not take last place in dressing the goat in underpants.  There's actually gay rodeo stars.  They came in after the talk show host and his fake gay friends.  Well, you didn't care what it looked like on.  They probably wanted it just so. 
[01:53:30]  No one line killed, Jay?  You show a sign that says, thanks for coming, and you look at the camera and go,  and this isn't even the exit.  Yeah.  Thanks for coming.  I like gay TM.  The gay TM.  And then you just go, ha, ha, ha, ha.  You guys are dying.  Guess who?  I got Suge Knight tonight.  Get out of here.  Do you ask the tough questions?  Absolutely.  What do you think is the first question I asked him?  Did you hang Vanilla Ice out by him?  Yes!  Yes!  Yes!  Yes!  That's the first effing question I asked him.  That's the first thing I had to ask him. 
[01:54:00]  And what did he say?  He goes, I don't recall.  And I said, me neither.  I was in the bathroom.  I didn't see nothing, Suge.  I was in the bathroom the whole time.  Ryan, you're a smart guy.  Yeah.  We're down with the row now, baby.  We're down with the row.  Was he cool?  He was super cool.  You better say that.  No, he was.  I was changing his image.  I don't know how much I would.  He's trying to come across as a cool guy that you want to like now.  He came in two hours late, and he brought this rapper.  He wanted to come out with him.  And all the producers are running around like, 
[01:54:30]  he wants to bring out Crooked Eye.  That was the name of his rapper.  And I said, who cares?  Just set up another chair.  I don't give a crap.  As long as I get to ask a vanilla ice question.  Sit Crooked Eye down, mofo.  And Dave Navarro performs acoustic with another guy.  Wow, nice.  Really awesome.  Does he rub suntan lotion on you, Jack?  No, he was.  He met Suge Knight, though, and he said he met Clinton two weeks before,  and he said meeting Suge Knight was cooler.  Oh, I would think so.  Hey, I got a question for that guy.  I was doing 150 miles an hour through a construction zone in D.C. 
[01:55:00]  with Kwame Brown with a family of Haitians in my trunk and a heroin needle coming out of my bag.  And I had an eight ball in my crotch.  What do I do?  Can I just pin it all on Kwame Brown?  Now, how long did you rehearse that before you rattled that out?  That was pretty good.  Oh, man.  It was on the spot.  Don't bite the ball that feeds you.  Come on, brother.  Jay's a professional actor.  That's from the top of his head.  He knows it.  And we got Sandy Allison in studio, Jay.  The last time, I called once, and she was on already.  She's that sexy woman that talked about sex. 
[01:55:30]  She has a book, Tickle Your Fancy.  A Woman's Guide to Sexual Self-Pleasure.  Women self-pleasuring, Jay.  I am all for my wife self-pleasuring herself.  Good for you.  Yeah, gets her going.  Sometimes, Sandy, I come home, and there's stuff plugged in on walls next to certain angles.  Sandy, Sandy, whatever.  That can only be used in a certain way, and I just say, hey, great.  You know what that means to me, Sandy?  What is that?  Sandy's ready for some serious lumber.  That's right.  And, you know, I'm so glad that you're open to it, and that's one of the biggest myths 
[01:56:00]  that most men out there feel inadequate if their woman self-pleasures.  Oh, no.  It's ridiculous, because really, you want your woman to be into herself, because then she's  going to be more into you when you guys are making love.  How do you get her to do it in front of you there, Sadie?  You ask nicely.  Eh, they get a little embarrassed.  Why don't you start yourself and say, no, you do it?  Oh, so you just start cranking it?  Yeah.  And then she goes, did you learn that at the gay rodeo?  Did you laugh at the gay rodeo?  Then your chick goes, I saw what you were doing there, and it's totally normal. 
[01:56:30]  Jay, I didn't realize how great of an actor you were.  Let's just put it that way.  I hope that was acting.  Tonight on the show, I go curling.  And let me tell you something.  If I can't make curling interesting, it's hopeless.  Yeah.  Yeah, cool.  We lost to the United States Olympic curling team, 1-0.  Of course you did.  Me and, like, my writing staff.  We lost 1-0 to Olympic curlers.  What does that mean?  It means it's lawn darts on ice.  It's the dumbest thing I've ever seen in my life. 
[01:57:00]  So, you're saying you did well?  It's literally, that's how stupid it is.  Put a shooting target on the ice, like a bullseye with more points, and you roll the 42-pound stone.  It's bocce ball slash shuffleboard on ice.  What are the brooms for, Jay?  The brooms are for sweeping to make the stone go faster so it doesn't get held up.  What if you need to slow it down?  You don't slip as much.  Nothing.  I'm telling you, it's the dumbest thing in the world.  Sounds it.  Well, we got Dave Navarro playing acoustic, and we got Suge Knight. 
[01:57:30]  And I want to tell you about when I got caught cranking.  Oh, go ahead.  I thought this would be kind of funny.  I was watching the Cars video.  Summer got me upside down.  You remember that song?  Sure.  And they had all the chicks by the pool, like in their bikinis.  So, I'm on my couch.  MTV was new.  Your mom caught you?  Hold on now.  Oh, no.  Let's go.  I'm cranking.  Barry Katz, the big Jew walks in, right?  I'm right at the point where, you know, sound and shapes and colors just kind of go out the window. 
[01:58:00]  You're at that little precipice before it's blasted off.  Right.  We're like, you don't even really care at this point.  Yeah.  And Rick O. Kasich was walking on water, and there were three chicks around him in bikinis.  And, you know, I'm like 13.  I said, oh, yeah, there they go.  And my mom and my sister, Julie, come in with, like, arms filled with grocery bags.  Oh.  Oh, and he digs it up.  And they dropped all the groceries. 
[01:58:30]  I ran out of the house in my socks.  I did not come home.  You were completely nude, Jay.  No, no, no.  Oh, oh, oh, it's magic.  It's true, it's magic.  Hey, Mom, I do.  Oh.  So check this out.  I'm wearing just, I'm wearing my socks.  Yeah.  Can you play this song?  Oh, yeah.  Let it rip.  Upside down.  Oh, I'm cranking. 
[01:59:00]  And my mommy walking down.  She dropped the groceries on the floor.  Yeah.  This is a well-produced show when you find that song.  That's the magic that it's been.  And what, so you were wearing your socks and what else?  I was wearing, like, normal clothes.  I just didn't have any shoes on.  And you had it out. 
[01:59:30]  Well, yeah.  So it was kind of like, it was kind of like peeking out the top of my pants type deal.  Like, just a helmet.  And you're going to town.  And they walk in, they drop all the groceries.  My sister goes, what are you doing?  Oh, how embarrassing.  And so then I run out of the house in my socks.  And literally, when I tell you it was like midnight, it was midnight.  I was walking around Verona, New Jersey in my socks.  And then finally my mom pulled up next to me in the car. 
[02:00:00]  Oh, man.  And said, it happens to everyone.  Get in.  Oh, with all your disgusting guilt.  You still probably, because if you just ran out of the house, did you have byproduct on you?  No, I never got there.  Here's audio of Jay talking to his mom in the car.  Oh, it's all going.  I love in that clip you played when the guy asked the retarded guy how old he was.  Yeah.  Like, what kind of home are you running?  You don't know how old your occupants are. 
[02:00:30]  But you know, that's a tricky question.  Because most retarded people, you think they're like 13 years old because of the way they act.  And they're like, 44.  And you're like, oh, yeah, that's right.  I've known you my whole life.  Yeah.  Hey, Jay, your neighbor was peeking in as you were doing this to the cars.  Red rocket.  Red rocket.  Red rocket is right, baby.  And that moment, it was definitely purple rocket.  Jay turning to his mother as she pulls up in the car.  I got nowhere else to go. 
[02:01:00]  I got nowhere else to go.  That's awesome.  Cars, man.  Here's Jay getting caught in what he had to say.  No!  All right, Jay.  All right.  You know, now out of respect, you've got to play something from the row.  Yeah.  From the what?  From death row.  Suge Knight.  Really?  Really, home? 
[02:01:30]  Come on, guys.  Here's Jay's dad catching him.  Mule.  Mule.  That's right, mule.  You're damn right he said mule.  Now, here he is when he caught him.  Is that supposed to be sexy?  All right, Jay.  We're all going to check out more sports.  Play it again.  I couldn't hear it.  No, it only works once.  What, are you going to do it all day?  Hey, I've been getting good stuff from the people in New York on jaymorelive.com and talking  back and forth.  And I wanted to let you thank you guys for letting me just drop the website on the air 
[02:02:00]  and let people know that if they email me, I will email them back.  But Suge Knight and Dave Navarro, man, we're bringing it.  Oh, and my wife is in lingerie in the cold open.  Oh!  I should have gotten to that sooner.  Yes.  And it's a takeoff on the Osbournes.  Is she still pregnant?  No, come on.  You're talking crazy.  What?  You're talking crazy.  Look, she's in lingerie, and we do a nice little thing.  And we show Starks' dunk over Jordan, too. 
[02:02:30]  Did I say something stupid?  No, I'll talk to you later.  Okay.  What happened?  I hope he's got to open his fat yap.  Well, I opened it first, in fairness.  Hold on.  Okay.  All right.  Hold on.  What just happened?  I don't know.  Probably one of the most uncomfortable moments in radio history. 
[02:03:00]  This is less fun than previously indicated.  No, nothing bad.  Oh, really?  No, no, no.  Nothing bad.  Just nothing public, either.  I understand.  Okay.  I misspoke.  I misspoke.  I, uh...  I, uh...  I, uh...  Boy, Opie...  In the words of Ron...  You must have been thinking that...  Wow.  Now I understand why there was such a delay.  Maybe you should call your pals and let them in on some things. 
[02:03:30]  Yeah, we'll let you know.  All right.  But, uh...  Sorry.  You know, Jay, it takes a lot for me to be uncomfortable.  I'm very uncomfortable right now.  No, there's nothing...  Everything's fantastic.  There's nothing to be uncomfortable about.  Well, you'll explain, and maybe we could, um, pass it along to, uh, the listeners.  See, that's what I don't want to have happen.  All right.  Because it's like, you want your private to stay private.  I got you.  And when I spoke earlier, I misspoke.  But, see, I wouldn't have said what I said if you would have told me ahead of time. 
[02:04:00]  I absolutely know that.  Okay, okay.  But nothing bad has happened.  All right.  Are you still uncomfortable now?  I thought I kind of cleared it up.  Well, it's, uh, it's not helping matters here with a sound effect machine.  All right, Ann, we all get it.  This calls...  There's, uh...  Hold on, hold on.  Hold on, hold on.  Bill.  Ted Knight's going to help us out here, Jay.  This calls for the old Billy Baroo.  Oh, Billy, Billy, Billy, Billy, Billy, Billy. 
[02:04:30]  Oh, Billy, Billy.  This is a biggie.  Let me go.  $30,000, Billy.  Advice for Hopi.  Could you shut up?  All right, I'm good.  Could you shut up?  I'm going to shut up now.  No, every...  Honestly, everything's absolutely fantastic.  And, uh, I'm sorry you felt that uncomfortable, Op.  I should have talked to you during the break.  It's not like, uh...  No, nothing happened. 
[02:05:00]  It's not like...  No, don't even say it.  It's not like no one else...  No, no, no, no, no, no, no.  ...just feeling what I just felt.  Nothing happened.  Shut up!  I think...  Shut up!  I think all the air was sucked out of the studio for a moment there.  No, no, no, no.  Okay.  All right.  All right.  Nothing like that.  Okay.  And don't be stupid.  I'm trying not to be stupid.  Just when I spoke to you earlier, I severely misstepped my boundaries as, like, a family guy.  What the hell is that?  Okay.  All right.  I understand, Jay.  Okay.  Terrific.  Do you understand where I'm coming from? 
[02:05:30]  Yes, I do.  Okay.  Terrific.  Everything's great.  Hey, hey, look at this.  I hate you, man.  I hate you.  Okay.  Terrific.  Let me get out of this, please.  Hey, no.  I know how to get out of it.  Suge Knight and Dave Navarro, tonight at Moore Sports, 1230 a.m.  And you can email me at jaymoorelive.com.  Nice!  There you go.  And you're flying in for our celebrity softball game, right?  I have to.  Of course you have to.  I've got to get off the schneid after my gay strikeout at the gay rodeo.  Quiet.  All right.  Quiet.  All right.  Quiet.  I haven't said a word.  Quiet.  Quiet.  Anthony, everything's resolved.  Shut up, Demi. 
[02:06:00]  And a man in my position can't afford to be made to look ridiculous.  Well, I feel a little ridiculous right now.  Why?  Nothing happened.  Of course not.  Of course not.  I understand everything you just said.  Shut up!  All right.  Shut up.  I'm stopping you.  Could you shut up?  Quiet.  Quiet.  Let's talk about asking Suge Knight if we know I could hold out the window.  Okay.  All right, Jay.  Let's talk to the cop and the sex therapist.  I don't want to leave you guys a weird energy.  Very happy to be here.  All right.  We're fine.  I had a big story about getting caught cranking. 
[02:06:30]  I thought that was very interesting.  Very interesting indeed.  Yeah, but that's not what the show opens up like I do.  I talk about my sperm count getting caught.  Maybe that's why my sperm count was so low, because I was beating my crank in front of my  mom all the time.  Hey, I didn't mention anything about a sperm count.  I thought I told you to shut up.  I haven't said a word, Anthony.  Who keeps pushing?  You're making it worse, Anthony.  Oh, Billy.  You're killing everyone around you, Leon.  There you go.  Whatever.  I'll do what I will.  All right. 
[02:07:00]  Where's Norton?  I took the day off.  He's going to be with us the rest of the week, because we're hitting the road and stuff.  It's a long story.  He's a valuable man.  All right, Jay.  Thank you.  God bless you.  And I'm going to go on hold right now, so Obi can come run and pick up a telephone.  All right.  I'll talk to you.  More sports.  Very, very funny.  More sports.  He just wants to make sure we don't say anything after we say thank you, Jay.  ESPN.  No, you guys, you do what you do.  What do I know?  You'll hear the commercials play while you're on hold.  What do I care?  Say what you want to say.  All right.  Thank you, Jay.  See you guys.  Jay Moore, everyone.  We're going to get a Starker Patty update. 
[02:07:30]  We'll continue with Sadie Allison and Alex Carroll as well.  I see, like, Mario Cantone out there.  I see Paul Mercurio out there.  I'm wet and sticky.  What do I do?  And we still haven't heard from Steve-O.  And we have to talk to Casey next.  She's been waiting now three hours to try to get in on a money snatch game.  So lots of shows still to go.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  I just want to be with a man who'll ignore me and take me for granted and who's only pretending to be interested in who I am and what I think so he can get into my scale. 
[02:08:00]  Dirty girls need love to you.  Opie.  And there's no way a guy can get a rub and a tug around here.  Anthony.  And we're back with the Opie and Anthony Show.  Lots going on, Anthony.  Too much going on for one day.  Sadie Allison in studio.  She's a sexpert.  She's got a book.  Tickle Your Fancy.  A Woman's Guide to Sexual Self-Pleasure.  She's got a website.  TickleKiddy.com.  Oh.  And she just gave me a little self-pleasuring kick to take home with me. 
[02:08:30]  I saw that.  I got one, too, Opie.  She gave me one of those C rings.  There's a thing.  It goes around your C.  She says the ladies like the C ring, Anthony.  Yeah, I hope this stretches.  This does.  Oh, it'll stretch?  Because that's like pencil D.  You know what I mean?  Oh, she says it stretches.  Yeah, it's very stretchy.  And then this part here rubs on where the woman...  On her pleasure spot, yeah.  Yeah, she does. 
[02:09:00]  I have a tough time with these type of things because I think after the act is over, you  kind of look silly.  You're going to look silly pulling that off of yourself?  You've got to get it off before you turn the lights back on.  She'll be glowing, though, so it won't matter.  All right.  There's actually the self-pleasuring jumpstart kit.  Because I can't afford to be made to look ridiculous.  And you would look ridiculous if you have that still on you after the act.  You look like the sloped back horse with that harness.  I'm the little rascals.  And go ahead, Sadie.  So this self-pleasuring kit is great for newcomers. 
[02:09:30]  It's for the...  No gold.  Exactly.  It's got a variety of sex toys in it to pleasure all the different...  Newcomers?  Yes.  Isn't that a great word?  There's lube in there.  There's vibrators for all the different erogenous zones.  At the junior high school?  And it comes with the instructional guide, Tickle Your Fancy, that tells you how to use  everything.  Very nice.  And then we have Alex Carroll, Anthony, and he's got the book about...  Yeah, the brand new book.  It's called Speeding Excuses That Work.  And so this is like... 
[02:10:00]  There's like 100 pages of excuses in here that were submitted by people all over the country.  And I've got to give you guys some of these.  Some of them are really good.  Yeah, give us a couple.  Well, because then we've got to move on to Paul Mercurio and Stalker Paddy's here, Anthony.  Yeah.  So one of my favorite ones that I got...  Actually, I just got this one not too long ago.  This was a guy he sent in and he says...  He says, the cop stopped me and pulled me over and wanted to know why I was speeding so fast.  And he said, I'm so sorry, officer.  I just came from the clinic and I was getting treatment for genital warts.  Oh, how about that?  And I'm rushing to the drugstore to get the cream to cool it down because, you know, they 
[02:10:30]  like burn these things off with like liquid nitrogen or something.  He has the cop the brochure to show him how it happens.  And the cop's like, just, just, just...  Oh, he had a brochure with him?  Just get out of here.  So he had to do a little advanced planning for that one.  So he's telling everyone to get the brochure and keep it in your glove compartment.  Get the brochure.  Stop by the clinic.  Pick yourself up a genital warts treatment brochure.  Oh, that's good.  Then another one of my...  My mom goes through your car.  Yeah, exactly.  Then you got another guy.  This guy, the first time it happened to him, it was a true story.  But anyway, he tells the cop and he gets pulled over.  He says, look, I'm sorry, officer.  He says, I live on a third-story apartment building.  My waterbed sprung a leak this morning. 
[02:11:00]  I couldn't find a garden hose around anywhere.  He said, look, you can get me a ticket if you want, but you're going to have to follow me back  because it's flooding a downstairs apartment right now.  And he's like, ah, don't worry about it.  Get out of here.  So now the guy carries the garden hose around with him.  He's gotten out of seven tickets in a row using the garden hose.  Then, got a whole section of female-only excuses.  This is my favorite one from a chick.  She writes in and she said, I'm sorry, officer.  About ten minutes ago, I tripped and I fell down a flight of stairs.  She said, I'm rushing to the hospital because I think one of my implants just sprung a leak. 
[02:11:30]  Oh.  Yeah.  Well, she has to have implants, though.  Well, she didn't have implants.  Really?  She said, funny thing is, I don't have implants.  Another one of my favorite female excuses was this chick.  She said, look, she said, I'm so sorry, officer.  She said, I got to pee really bad.  And you know, if you're a guy, he's just going to say, okay, great.  I'll just write the ticket faster.  But the clincher was, he said, I have an excruciatingly painful bladder infection.  Cops like, let that one go every time.  Then another one that was really cool is this guy.  This guy, he gets stopped. 
[02:12:00]  He pretends to be a mute.  Oh, that's interesting.  And he's got a blank pad of paper.  And when the cop comes up to the window, he just writes, hello, officer, on his blank pad  of paper and hands it to the cop.  And the cops always feel so sorry for him because they're like, oh, my God, this poor guy can't  even talk.  And they let him go.  Make sure you put your cell phone away if you're going to use that one.  Yeah, yeah.  You don't want to have that one lame.  And Alex has a website, copouts.com, Anthony.  Copouts.  Copouts.com.  And the toll-free number is 866-COP-OUTS. 
[02:12:30]  And if they want to get either my first book, Beat the Cops, or this book, and they mention  your show, they get a free list of speed traps for the entire state of New York or Jersey  or Connecticut or wherever the hell they're listening at, along with the book.  And they also get a free brochure that tells them all about the organization that will actually  pay the fine on their speeding ticket.  Oh, yeah?  Oh, yep.  So the numbers are 866-COP-OUTS, and the website's copouts.com.  And got a bunch more here if you guys want to hear some of them.  There's, oh.  Oh, hold on.  Well, you know something?  Slow down. 
[02:13:00]  Slow down.  We, uh, yeah.  We'll try to get back to you in a second.  We are so limited right now as far as time goes.  And Sadie wants to give out a number or something real fast.  Yeah, I've got a special going on for all of your listeners.  If you call or go to the website today and you order Tickler or Fancy or the Jump Start  Kit, I'm going to give away three free gifts if you mention the Opie and Anthony show.  Gifts?  Three gifts.  One of them is a mini massager vibrator.  Ah, free.  A free vibrator.  You get a free special report that reveals women's top 12 sexual fantasies, which is 
[02:13:30]  very interesting.  And some lubricant.  So you can go ahead and you get the book.  Lube it up.  Lube it up.  So the phone number to call and order the book is 866-SELF-LOVE.  Self-love.  Self-love.  866.  Or the website is TickleKitty.com.  Yeah, all right.  Tickling the kitty.  Very good.  Thank you.  Thank you.  We have to go to Casey because she's been waiting now three hours and 15 minutes.  Oh, my God.  No.  Casey.  Yes.  We're doing the O&A money snatch game tomorrow. 
[02:14:00]  Yes.  Cowbell Bill's leaving us and he's taking...  Bill's got to leave.  He's taking all the books with us.  Oh, yeah.  Look at you.  Oh, you got a little gift pack today.  Let's go home and read this with the girlfriend.  Yeah.  All right.  Thank you, Bill.  Take it easy, Bill.  All right, Casey.  Yes.  How old are you?  26.  And you want to be in the money snatch game tomorrow?  Yep.  Tomorrow's going to be a very exciting show.  We got about seven girls that are definitely coming down here to get completely naked in  the studio and try to get as much cash as possible, Anthony, in a five-minute period. 
[02:14:30]  Casey, you'll do this as long as you don't mind that final twist we're going to tell you?  Nope.  You don't mind being naked in front of a room full of other girls that are naked and  people on the show?  Nope.  Very good.  You need some money?  Yes.  You sound like a bore, Casey.  I don't care how they sound.  Well, she sounds, you know, once she's naked, grabbing cash.  You all right, Casey?  Yeah, I'm fine.  All right.  You're on the radio.  Eighteen cities are listening to you right now.  Sorry.  All right.  So you have no problem being naked with the rest of the girls like you just said. 
[02:15:00]  No problem whatsoever.  There's another twist, and Anthony's going to explain that.  I'll explain it to you.  And we're going to turn down Anne's mic because it gets a little graphic.  It gets a little graphic.  Because I have to kind of, I have to see what the girl's mindset is open.  Right.  And I've got to see if she's up for something like this, because we can't afford to have  people that come down and they're not ready for it.  So the only way to tell if they're ready is by doing this little pre-interview and then  letting them in on that final twist.  And if you're okay with the final twist, we'll add you to the list.  That'll be down here tomorrow.  Okay?  Okay.  Here's the music.  And Anthony's mic is now off. 
[02:15:30]  I don't think you can hear me.  I can't.  What happened?  What got changed?  I don't know.  I don't know.  I think Pre had to be down.  Yes.  Okay.  It was Pre.  Today it was Pre.  I can hear me on my phone.  I can't hear me.  How about now?  I can't hear me.  Yeah.  Why can I hear you?  What changed over there?  Did someone push something? 
[02:16:00]  No.  Because I can hear you bleeding through.  I can't.  I can't.  How about now?  I can't hear him.  Oh, my God.  What happened?  What changed?  Who pushed what?  All right.  Go ahead.  Try again, Anthony.  Oh, my God.  I can hear myself.  I can hear myself.  I can totally.  I can totally hear myself.  Something got screwed up.  Something got screwed up.  Someone pushed the goddamn effing button.  Shouldn't have been pushed.  Let me try this.  Try again.  Go. 
[02:16:30]  I can't hear him.  You can't hear him?  Nope.  How about this?  Yes.  Is it A or B?  Yes.  All right.  Good.  I got it.  What?  Shut up.  Put your goddamn clothes back on.  Now I'm only hearing you in.  Can you hear me now?  Can you hear me now?  What?  Now I only hear myself on my left.  Yeah.  Now your mic and phone is completely.  Can you hear me now?  Can you hear me now?  Can you hear me now?  How about that?  Now I hear me in both ears. 
[02:17:00]  All right.  Can you hear him?  Now.  Now I hear me in both ears.  Now I hear me in both ears.  Yeah.  All right.  There you go.  Now I'm not.  Okay.  Anthony's finally talking to Casey.  Yeah.  Hi.  I can barely hear you.  Oh my God.  What happened?  Somebody screwed with something.  God damn it. 
[02:17:30]  God damn it.  God damn it.  You got the triple god damn it.  Now I hear myself in one ear.  I hit myself in two ears.  Take him out of free.  Ah.  No.  It has nothing to do with that.  If only this worked as fluidly as The Daily Show works.  On a daily basis.  I didn't mess with any of that.  Try that.  No.  I didn't mess with any of that.  I did that.  This is literally like.  Hold on.  Your mic's not even on.  I'll be.  I'll be.  I'm half of this show.  I'm 50% of this. 
[02:18:00]  Please.  We have to work together.  Get Ben in here.  Yeah.  Oh, good.  Bring another person into the mix.  Am I?  Well, you can hear me now, but I'm like soaking everybody.  All right.  Try it again, Ant.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Now we don't hear you.  Now this is perfect.  Yeah.  That's great.  All right.  We got it.  We got you.  All right.  Go ahead.  Get right to the twist.  We've wasted so much time.  Yes.  Yes.  Yes. 
[02:18:30]  Mm-hmm.  Yes.  He's still bleeding through.  You are.  Don't worry.  I'm covering it up.  You're.  I can still barely hear you.  Yes.  Yes.  Yes.  How about that?  Okay.  Oh, sorry.  Hold on.  Let me ask you the twist.  All right.  Ant's asking you the twist.  Yes. 
[02:19:00]  Mm-hmm.  Yes.  Yes.  Mm-hmm.  Very good.  I'll be back up.  And so, Casey, without repeating what I said or letting anyone know what I said, you're  good for that.  Yeah.  Opie, Casey's in.  Casey's in.  Oh, we're going to save 20 minutes then.  Son of a bitch.  All right, Casey, hold on the line, okay?  Okay.  You'll be joining us tomorrow for the O&A Money Snatch Game.  Okay.  I don't understand how buttons get pushed during the show.  I don't know.  Paul did it? 
[02:19:30]  What?  It's Paul's fault.  I started the whole thing.  God damn you.  People.  Put your goddamn microphone on.  Hey, Casey.  What do you think about, uh, we're going to have a whole studio full of nude girls tomorrow.  Uh, why do I come today?  Why don't I come on those days?  I know.  You should come tomorrow.  So that way maybe you could yell something out to girls.  Whatever you feel like yelling.  Punch you in the face if you don't come.  Come to the studio, of course.  I hope your wound is barren.  We might get two more contestants before the end of the show. 
[02:20:00]  Oh, really?  Yes.  But Paul Mercurio is in studio.  Yes.  Very good friend.  Hi.  Nice to see you.  And Paul has a big announcement to make today, Anthony.  A huge, huge announcement.  Paul?  I, uh, I went to, uh, a play recently.  Yeah.  And my voice is changing.  Uh, and, uh, I went to see The Graduate.  Oh, you did?  How was it?  How was that?  It's with that, um, Kathleen, uh, Kathleen Turner and, uh, Jason Biggs. 
[02:20:30]  Biggs, Biggs.  Sure, sure.  How was it, by the way?  Well, that's the announcement.  I thoroughly enjoyed it.  Uh-huh.  I thought the acting was fabulous.  The lighting was fabulous.  Uh, I thought, uh, the security guards couldn't have been nicer.  Oh, really?  Yeah, they taught me.  How much did that cost, the ticket?  That cost me $45, but then there's a service charge of $1.25.  Yeah?  Which I didn't realize until after.  I bet you didn't.  And, uh...  The laughter, you didn't even know there was a service charge.  Had a bottle of water for $4.50? 
[02:21:00]  Oh, you did, didn't you?  Yeah, six ounces of water.  Oh, nice.  Is it true we have audio of you from the, uh...  I don't know how you would have that, Rochester.  Okay.  Is this audio of you, Paul?  Are you willing to finally admit it?  This is rough.  Oh, my God.  Athlete, put your goddamn clothes back on.  Really?  That kept the bell seemed kind of far away. 
[02:21:30]  Yeah, that was.  Is there anything closer?  Maybe there was a, maybe there was some microphone closer to you at that point.  Could that have been possible?  Let's listen.  Kathleen, put your goddamn clothes back on.  Sounds like Tony Soprano to me.  Are you finally admitting that you did it?  Are you fessing up to this finally?  Kathleen, put your goddamn clothes back on. 
[02:22:00]  Yeah!  Finally!  Paul Mercurio.  Paul Mercurio.  I thought I was going to have a heart attack just before I did it.  Wow.  The famous voice.  You're a pussy.  It took you two months to finally take the credit.  He wanted to make sure everything was blown over and there were no repercussions.  I have, uh...  Yeah, Paul Mercurio was the guy that went to the graduates,  and, uh, when Kathleen Turner was completely naked on the stage,  he stood up in front of everyone and said,  Kathleen, put your goddamn clothes back on.  Yeah.  We had, uh, three or four, uh, guys in the place with microphones. 
[02:22:30]  Yes, very...  Here's another angle of, uh...  Very secretive.  ...of Paul Mercurio doing that.  Oh, my God.  Kathleen, put your goddamn clothes back on.  I can't believe you just called me a pussy.  I know.  He does that, and he's a pussy.  You didn't do it.  I, I'm in here two days before I go, and you're like...  He's like, when if we could just find somebody,  and you go to the thing, and stand up, and yell.  Exactly.  You go.  I, I say I'm going to go, and I go, and I do it.  It took you so long to take the credit. 
[02:23:00]  I have, but I have...  You're a hero, and the listener is, uh...  Hey, Jon Stewart, put your goddamn clothes back on.  All right, I'll stop.  Jesus.  All right, you're not a pussy.  You're finally admitting it.  It was Paul Mercurio.  Yes.  So now, here's the Godfather music.  Because he's, uh, inducted into the mob now.  The mafia mob that is the Opie and Anthony show.  Well, I thought the whole thing was a scam,  because, like, two minutes before the play starts...  It's Paulie Balls.  Thank you.  Paul thought... 
[02:23:30]  We forgot to tell people.  Paul thought we were setting him up.  Well, there's this whole thing, and we go in,  and we're not supposed to make eye contact,  and I go down, and I go into the men's room,  and there's, like, every guy going to the men's room,  and then Rick goes in,  and I go in, and...  It is Broadway.  And so we're in the thing,  and I'm in the stall,  and I see out.  Thank God I looked at his shoes,  because I recognized his shoes.  So I was done checking for fissures and stuff,  and then, uh...  He hands me the thing.  All you needed was, like,  the Mission Impossible theme music.  He hands me the thing on it.  The recorder.  He just turns it on for me.  He hands it to me, 
[02:24:00]  and I put it in the thing,  and I go out.  And it took, like, 15 minutes  to get that together, right, Rick?  Yeah, about that.  Am I boring you with this?  No, go, go.  All right, so...  So you crawled through the ventilation system  to get to your seat.  So I crawled through the ventilation system.  Just for good measure,  I did warm-up,  and I punched an old lady in the heart.  I couldn't help myself.  There were 300 people there.  Come on, people!  You got him.  And, uh, so then I go to sit down,  and as it's getting closer,  literally, my heart is, like,  it's boom, ba-boom, ba-boom.  And, uh, I go to sit down,  and Rick, the plan is, 
[02:24:30]  he comes and sits next to me,  but nobody...  We don't know each other.  So Rick sits next to me.  Yeah.  And, uh, you know,  he gives a...  And he's, like, really, like,  he's really acting it out.  There's no one else around,  but he's acting it out thoroughly.  He looks at the little number.  Excuse me, is that...  Just sit down, for God's sake.  We know that...  Was the tape recorder taped  behind the toilet in the bathroom.  That was exactly what it felt like.  You know that moment  as you hear the subway coming,  and his eyes are darting back and forth?  Right, yeah.  So I'm sitting there,  and then Rick,  just before it starts,  before the lights go down, 
[02:25:00]  Rick gets up.  Uh-oh.  And then the play starts,  and Rick is not coming back.  So now you're thinking...  So I'm seeing the two of you  off somewhere,  laughing your ass off,  drinking beer,  going,  but Jerry, we totally screwed!  I don't know if it's on,  I don't know if it's off,  I don't know if I should do this.  That's the beauty of the show.  You're never quite sure.  And I was going to say,  this is like the Sting,  this is like a con within a con.  Within the con.  It's like Chinese dolls.  Actually, we were going to have,  which would be a fun idea  that we might do next time,  instead of a recording device,  have a radio control taser. 
[02:25:30]  So we can sit there,  and then just tase you in your seat,  and as you convulse,  the security comes,  everyone laughs.  So I'm sitting there,  and I look,  I say,  okay,  I'm going to just look back once,  because I don't want to look suspicious.  Meanwhile,  I'm also checking,  yeah,  I'm also checking the mic,  the recorder,  to make sure I didn't accidentally  hit it,  and I don't even know  if it's on or not,  so I've got to keep checking it,  and I'm reading this thing,  but I'm not really reading  the words in the program.  Yeah.  There's a lot going through my mind.  I'm seeing my life  flash before my eyes.  Sure.  Kathleen Turner,  the night that we had together, 
[02:26:00]  that's all by the board.  Big,  big,  big moment  that was coming up.  Oh my God.  Really bad.  What an abortion.  Really?  I felt so good about the fact  I was going to do it  when the play started.  And then you stand up.  She had that effective voice going.  Did she have that thing going?  Oh,  oh,  oh,  oh,  oh.  Well,  let me tell you something.  It's like,  it's really breathy  and over the top.  Do you find me sexy?  Exactly.  Shut up.  What's the kid's name in this play?  What's the,  not Biggs?  Jason Biggs.  Jason,  Jason Biggs come in and that's like  watching a bag of rocks. 
[02:26:30]  Oh my God.  Really?  Just bad?  It was literally like watching  an acting class 101  where two people like think  they're really good  and she comes on  and she's like,  oh,  so please get me Benjamin  is his name.  Benjamin,  do you find me?  Please help me with the,  oh.  Over the top.  It was like a horse in a dress.  It was ridiculous.  Oh my God.  And as every moment was going on,  I was like 50 minutes in,  I felt more and more better  about myself  that I was going to do this.  You bet you were going to do it.  I think I felt like I was doing it  for the world.  Oh,  you had a lot for everybody.  Listen again,  you have a lot of confidence, man. 
[02:27:00]  It's on the bed.  Oh God.  The fish rocks.  Oh my God.  Kathleen,  put your goddamn clothes back on.  It's like you're angry with her.  You're angry with the woman.  I have taken some acting classes  so I really got in the head of it.  Put your goddamn clothes back on.  I was angry with her  because it was such bad.  It was like,  it's such a,  it's such a good idea  to put that as a play,  but it was such bad.  It was so like,  and the only reason she's naked  is no one would go to that  on the basis of acting.  They had to have a gimmick. 
[02:27:30]  It was to see her  roly-poly,  michelin,  you know what's,  bushy,  you know what's great?  That took place  about 15 minutes in.  Yeah.  Imagine if you had to sit  through like an hour and a half.  I would have jumped the stage.  You would have said no  at the guys.  I would have,  I would have,  Kathleen,  you suck,  you bitch,  CF.  I would have decapitated  Jason Biggs  and pooped down his neck.  Wonderful, though.  I'm surprised  that more people  didn't like,  comment and say something around you.  So really,  I really was going to,  I was about to abort the mission 
[02:28:00]  because I look back  and I look back  and I see him standing  at the pole  and I'm like,  what's he doing at the pole?  I don't know what's going on.  I'm thinking,  okay,  well he wants to get it  from another angle.  So Rick's at the pole  and I'm sitting there  and I'm waiting  and I'm waiting  and I just remember  and then I had to keep  telling myself,  don't say put your clothes  back on.  I was wondering,  I mean,  put your clothes,  I mean,  take your clothes off.  So I kept saying to myself,  put your clothes on.  So then I'm waiting,  I'm waiting,  I'm waiting  and man,  I'll tell you,  it was literally like  that scene in The Godfather  where he's sitting at the table  and he's about to pop it.  He's ready to shoot him.  And he's ready to shoot him 
[02:28:30]  and you're like,  and you can hear,  and I just,  man,  I just didn't want my voice to crack.  Put your clothes back on.  Hey,  Salazzo.  Hey,  fail cutlet parmesan,  put your clothes back on.  So I stand up  and I turn right a little bit  like I'm standing up  and radio  like people make it matters  and I turn right.  And you shot Lincoln in the head.  I turn to the house,  you know,  to project.  To project.  So I wanted to make,  I was so panicky  that you were,  Mr. Faber-Sham,  put your goddamn clothes back on. 
[02:29:00]  So I do it  and I think,  you know,  and you hear,  oh,  horrified people.  You have audio?  Yeah,  we just got like a woman  going,  most of the people  were pussies in the place.  They really just,  I think in this age of terrorism,  you being a Broadway show terrorist,  which is pretty much what you were,  you were terrorizing the performers.  They pretty much just figured  it was a safe bet to shut up. 
[02:29:30]  Yeah,  but you know,  I would have said something.  I would have said something.  You yelled it.  Of course you're going to say something.  The best part was the discussion  you had with the usher  that wanted to shut you out.  Well, what happened was  I had to do a lot of work for you guys  because I not only did I have to yell  and I had to create an argument.  I had to generate an argument  as to why you did this  and why it's right.  So the guy,  so the woman comes over,  she opens the curtain,  she closes the curtain,  one of the ushers.  Close the curtain,  nothing happens.  I'm thinking,  well,  did she get a beat on you though?  Did she make eye contact?  No,  because I just sat there  and I was just looking at the thing.  It wasn't like, 
[02:30:00]  I was like pointing at myself  going,  I'm the guy.  I put the clothes back on.  I'm the clothes back on guy.  So this big,  big,  huge black security guard  with bald,  shaved head comes over  and he stands like in the area.  So I just start talking to myself  out loud.  This is totally unacceptable.  I cannot believe.  You're doing the crazy talking guy.  He comes walking over to me  and he knows immediately  right on cue  and he leans in  and he goes,  sir,  I'm going to have to not to,  excuse me.  Well,  you have it.  Well,  you want to play it in? 
[02:30:30]  Good afternoon.  You've got to listen closely  because the guy,  you know,  he got in close to you,  I guess,  but the mic was through  my buttonhole  and my jacket  and he was talking right into it.  So Marcellus Wallace  leans over.  Right,  exactly.  All right,  let's listen in.  This place is terrible.  The kids.  What?  That's offensive.  You're not going to cheat 
[02:31:00]  any person.  No,  I'm not going to get up.  No.  So now the guy  is basically saying,  come on,  follow me,  get up.  His head was all sweaty.  Get up.  The top of his head  was all sweaty.  Get up and follow me.  I'm not getting up.  I'm not getting up.  How dare you?  You feel that stinging?  That's pride.  F-ing with you.  I think this is offensive.  Get out of the theater  and I'll give you a refund.  Now come this way.  Then he threatens me. 
[02:31:30]  Is it necessary  for her to take her clothes off  on the fence?  Sir.  Come this way,  please.  Men in the way  may like each other.  I'm sure.  Oh,  we found each other.  We certainly did.  I'm sure about you.  But now you get to drive home.  Now what did he say there?  To take you out.  Say what one more time.  Say what?  Say what?  He said,  if I have to take you out physically,  I will and I'll get you locked up.  And then I said,  on what basis can you get me locked up?  Now you're being belligerent.  It caused the disturbance in the house 
[02:32:00]  and now they want you out.  But then he gets cocky and goes,  okay, let's go.  Let's go.  All right.  I'll show you.  I'll leave.  That's my favorite line.  Pretty much it.  Let's go.  All right.  Just come with me, please.  You can't take me out physically.  On what basis?  Good night, Donald.  You have to start making a room  when I'm sorry.  Ben,  I can't do so much.  Ben,  it's a part.  Why does she have to be naked?  I can't hear those old things.  I'm not going to the party,  girl.  If you have them getting laid, 
[02:32:30]  I'll give you a reason why not.  All right.  Let's go.  That's ridiculous.  You leave.  All right.  Let's go.  At one point,  we were in a totally enclosed area,  just he and I,  because there are curtains,  and I thought he was going to start whacking me.  Just beat you.  Just beat the crap out of you.  He had an earring.  I figured he was gay,  so I was fine.  Yeah, well.  Well, maybe not.  I don't know.  The guy was just like,  he handled it.  I got to give him credit.  He handled it well,  because he could have made a huge thing about it  and grabbed me and stuff like that.  But then he's getting you out of the row 
[02:33:00]  and you're talking to all the people around you.  Well, yeah,  because I'm thinking,  I got this thing rolling  and my underwear is soaked with sweat at this point.  That's rough.  I'm having a baby down here.  I'm like freaking out.  I'm like,  I got to get something out of this.  So as I'm walking,  I'm looking at the people going,  you know,  you should be ashamed.  I'm doing like Crazy Joe guy on the corner.  Screaming at people.  And people are looking at me,  but nobody wants to say anything to me  because I'm not.  They're petrified,  because now you're playing crazy guy.  And then as I thought about it afterwards,  what I should have done  was when I walked by you, Rick,  I should have made eye contact with you  and started in with you. 
[02:33:30]  Like,  what are you looking at?  Oh,  big brawl.  Could have been good.  Would have been good.  Brawl.  Take him out,  beat him with my junk.  Oh my God.  Rick could have just been,  oh,  what's he doing?  Then they get you out near the box office  and you ask for the service charge.  He asks for his money back  and the service charge.  So I'm in the,  I'm not like near the box office  and all these people sitting around  and they're just all doing the same thing.  They're like sipping coffee  or drinking drinks  and they're just staring at me.  They're like freaked out.  The freak guy that yelled out.  And I'm pacing.  I'm pacing back and forth.  You did the perfect thing  being the crazy guy 
[02:34:00]  because they just want  to resolve the situation.  You were offended by this.  They don't want anything like that.  And you don't swear.  You don't do any of that.  And every once in a while  you throw something in the thing.  It sounds like you know the law.  Right.  Oh,  good,  good.  Government's property.  Government's property.  This is what legal justification.  And so the guy,  and they couldn't move fast enough  behind the register.  The woman's like,  you know,  she's got fries.  She's fries are flying everywhere.  When they give you back the money to jail,  no backs,  no backs,  no penny tax.  Because that would have really put him  in a position where, 
[02:34:30]  well,  no backs.  Right?  Sure.  All right.  Well,  we've got to move on,  but Paul Mercurio finally  taking responsibility.  Bravo.  Wow.  What a set of nuts.  Which made for great radio.  Great radio.  You've got more on it.  You're a god in the listener's mind.  That's brilliant.  Thank you.  I'm happy to do it for you guys.  We're going to take a break,  Anthony.  We've got to have so run out of time  and we've got other things.  We've got a Stalker Patty update,  a quick one.  The Patty situation.  No,  you did great.  No,  we needed that. 
[02:35:00]  Stay right there.  You'll help us with the last 20 minutes of the show.  And then we're going to try to get two more contestants  for the O&A Money Snatch game.  Paul doesn't really know about this.  What clock are you looking at?  We're going to do it all real fast next.  Really?  Yes.  Pull your pants down.  Can I see your taint whipped cream lesbian?  Can we see your butt?  Let me tell you about my balloon now.  The OPM.  The Anthony Show.  Radio's own swag.  Yeah,  we're back with the OPM Anthony Show.  We have 10 minutes to do a lot of things.  A lot of things. 
[02:35:30]  Get Stalker Patty in here.  We've got to get an update.  She's here,  Anthony.  I guess we're not going to be shaving our head today.  Paul Mercurio in studio.  We forgot to plug his gig.  He's playing Princeton.  Catch a Rising Star in Princeton,  New Jersey.  Wednesday to Saturday.  Very,  very funny guy.  Come on,  very funny guy.  Go see Paul Mercurio.  He helps out the show.  We have a girl from New Hampshire,  Andy.  Her name's Sandy.  I'm trying to say Anthony and Sandy at the same time.  Hence,  Andy.  Too much going on.  Sorry.  Sandy.  Sandy from New Hampshire. 
[02:36:00]  She's been waiting three and a half hours.  She's trying to get into the O&A Money Snatch game  that goes down tomorrow on this program.  Hi.  We have like eight or nine girls signed up for the contest.  Sandy.  Hello.  Sandy.  Sandy.  Sandy.  All right.  I guess she doesn't want it.  What the hell was that music?  It was the next track.  Oh.  Everything's going wrong today,  man.  All right.  Because,  see,  it was on continued.  This is real.  It's like watching the Titanic go.  This is. 
[02:36:30]  It's a disaster.  It happens.  Not my fault,  though.  It was on single instead.  I mean,  it was.  Yeah,  it should have been on single,  but it was on continued.  All right.  Oh,  well.  Well,  Stalker Patty's in the studio.  Where's Stalker Patty?  Hi,  Patty.  How are you?  Hi.  Hi.  So what happened now?  Where did you live last night?  Okay,  well,  somebody came through for me.  Hang on one second.  Hang on one second.  Patty,  keep your goddamn clothes on.  Yeah.  Thank you,  Paul.  Thank you. 
[02:37:00]  Patty,  actually,  you know what?  I'm going to Stu.  All right.  Who's three hours late,  Anthony.  He's just getting the program right now.  Oh.  Oh,  we're syndicated all over the place,  and some places we're three hours ahead of everybody else.  Stu,  what do you want to add to this show right now at a quarter to a seven or twenty to seven?  New York time.  Stu.  Stu.  Yeah,  hello.  Hi,  what do you want to add to this show?  Hey,  what's up,  ONA?  Hey.  Yeah,  I hear Sacramento calling in three hours late,  so I wanted to call in three hours late,  too.  Very good.  What do you want to comment on?  I'm from Seattle.  Let's go.  I haven't learned much at all, 
[02:37:30]  so.  What do you want to comment on?  Not much.  I want to call in three hours late.  You guys are.  Three hours late.  You guys are effing with our show now.  Three hours late.  I'm going to go listen to myself in three hours.  Well,  you do that.  Stu,  you know what?  What?  Seattle can't have this bit.  Why not?  You don't know how to do it.  No,  you don't know how to do it right.  Sacramento knows how to do the three hour late bit.  You stink.  Oh.  All right,  I'll take it.  Goodbye.  Goodbye.  Goodbye.  Good day,  sir.  He stinks,  and I don't like him.  Good day,  sir.  You aren't your bowler? 
[02:38:00]  My bowler.  Good day.  Good day,  sir.  Anthony,  I want to personally apologize to Sacramento.  Yeah.  Thinking that maybe another city could do the Sacramento bit.  I'm sorry.  I will never do that to Sacramento again,  Anthony.  The three hour late bit is Sacramento's bit.  Seattle.  Ah!  Puh!  Right.  Patty.  Yeah.  You had some problems yesterday.  We got in a big fight with your landlord.  Yeah.  You're no longer allowed to live at the apartment you were renting for $25 a week.  Right.  You got booted out.  Yes.  We offered you $906 yesterday to cut off what hair you've grown in the past eight months 
[02:38:30]  since the last time we shaved your head.  That's right.  You accepted the challenge.  Yes.  You have now found a new place to live.  Not yet.  What happened is I came back to where I was,  found all my stuff packed up nicely.  Oh,  it was packed up like they were kicking you out.  In boxes and bags.  Yeah.  And they made me give back the key,  so I did.  And then I just went and called up somebody that called him yesterday  who could help me move everything. 
[02:39:00]  So I got him.  And then I also just found a place to store everything in up on like...  I hope he doesn't move as slow as you talk.  You're never going to get moved out.  But anyway...  Isn't that funny?  They boxed up all her junk,  but she's never had junk in her box.  Isn't that like it's just a strange,  coincidental thing.  Bravo.  I don't have to worry about where my things are going.  I'm going to have a place to store them.  I just have to worry about me now,  and that's it.  I don't care.  Why?  So where did you sleep last night? 
[02:39:30]  In a hotel?  Yes.  Joyce was very nice to put me up in.  Yeah, I know.  She told us all that.  Okay.  Where are you sleeping tonight?  I'm sleeping in the hotel again.  Oh, again.  But then I check out tomorrow at 12 noon.  And I have no idea where you're going to be sleeping tomorrow night.  No,  but if all I have to worry about is just where I'm going...  Yeah,  she's staying at the Ritz,  but instead of an R,  it's an SH in front.  So it's almost the same.  You know.  Patty.  Patty.  Yes.  For some reason,  do you know Patty's got to go on a date?  What?  Oh, I heard that. 
[02:40:00]  With Al Dukes from Ron and Fez show?  They bet that Earl wouldn't get into the Rolling Stones conference,  but everybody else knew better,  and he got in.  He got in,  so now...  He's got his connections.  So now,  wait a minute.  Patty,  you don't date.  This is like your first date you're going on.  Wait, stop.  Are you kidding me?  I know.  It's crazy to believe, right?  Because Al's gay, so...  Al is such a flaming faggot.  Nothing's going to happen on this date.  Nothing's going to happen.  Your virginity will remain intact.  Do you know she's a virgin?  Oh, I know that.  But I'm very happy to be enjoying my...  Katie, she's a virgin. 
[02:40:30]  45 years old.  She's got so much guilt because of the Catholic Church  that she has not been able to pleasure her.  Give her one of these self-pleasure kits you've been handing out to everybody.  Yeah, do you have a little toy you could give the girl?  I have a toy for her and one of my books.  Do you self-pleasure, Patty?  Patty, do you?  Do you touch yourself around there?  She does, to the edge from you, too.  Yeah.  She has a fantasy about the edge from you, too.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Actually, it's just about his hat.  Yeah, it's just the hat.  It's just the headwear.  Well, we've got to wrap this up, Patty, because we're running out of time.  So you have no place to live tomorrow, but it doesn't bother you, right? 
[02:41:00]  No, the half of the load is off my mind with where to put my things.  Again, half a load is off of mine, but there's never, well.  You know, if all I have to do is just worry about...  Where will you sleep, do you think?  Well, I'm going to make some bones.  Are you off on the couch outside the studio?  Yeah.  You know, that'll be, you know, if worse comes to the worst.  All right, hold on.  Michelle, you want a good place to sleep?  Go to the play of The Graduate.  You'll not...  Not right out.  I know.  It's from what I care.  So many people yelling to get a good night's sleep, though.  From what I care. 
[02:41:30]  No one will yell in there again.  Michelle, real fast.  It's not Michelle, it's Strawberry, but I feel really bad for Patty, and if she needs a place  to stay, I'll be happy to take her in.  Oh, yeah?  No rent as long as she needs it.  Wow.  It's not a problem.  She's a really nice person.  All right, cool.  Hold on a line, Strawberry.  But you have to look at all of her knick-knacks, which are all strawberry-related.  Our listeners are coming through like crazy for Patty.  Now, what I heard, it's like inviting a tick to your leg.  It's like it just won't leave.  I think the last person where Patty stayed, they actually had to burn her head with a cigarette 
[02:42:00]  out of the house.  She wouldn't leave.  Because if the head stays, it'll just get infected.  It'll infect the whole house.  She's got legs like a relief mat, man.  All right, Patty, will you be doing the contest tomorrow, the ONA money snatch thing?  Of course, if I'm allowed to, I will.  You know, it's not okay.  You'll be completely naked with the rest of the girls?  And you know the twist, right?  Yeah, I do.  All right, well, we should let her do it then.  Patty, you're in if you want to be.  Okay.  All right, so we'll see you tomorrow.  I'm not going to be the winner, but okay. 
[02:42:30]  And you'll scrape up a few bucks.  And you'll allow us to shave your head again for $906?  Sure.  All right, we've just got to figure out when we're going to do that in.  All right.  Because now we're going to hit the road.  I know.  You know, tomorrow we've got the money snatch thing.  Thursday and Friday we hit the road in Philly and D.C.  I'm starting to think that we do it in the middle of our celebrity softball game.  Oh, I'll shave her hair.  Yeah.  Okay.  I thought you meant to be in the middle of the softball game.  Because we can put her big retard head right on the big huge jumbotron. 
[02:43:00]  It's a jumbotron and everyone could enjoy as we shave her head.  I'm a jumbotron.  That's what I'm starting to think.  That's fine.  Can we, after we cut our hair off, can we switch the jumbotron to black and white so it looks  like Schindler's List?  Because we saw her with her head shaved last time and it really looked bad.  I swear to God, it looked really, really bad.  And instead of effing with the listeners and teasing this damn thing, should we make it  official and we'll do it at the celebrity softball game?  We will do it at the celebrity softball game, right on the pitcher's mound. 
[02:43:30]  We will shave Patty's head.  Yeah, that game is Saturday, June 1st, Riverfront Stadium, home of the Newark Bears in Newark,  New Jersey.  Sponsored by Coors Light.  Tickets are on sale now.  There's not many left.  You can get them through Ticketmaster.  Can we get one of the Army people that do it?  Yeah, we want this done in seconds.  Just that go, wah, wah, wah, wah.  We'll have a drill sergeant screaming at you the whole time.  You are not worthy!  And we will hand you the money in the middle of the field after it's done.  Okay, Patty?  You have the body of an ant! 
[02:44:00]  Your hump is getting bigger!  My thorax to me.  My T-Rex.  Anthony, let me read a couple of these real fast because there's some great ones coming in.  Snyder from Philly.  I learned that a cul-de-sac is not a valid escape route when being chased by the police.  Al Mack from Clifton.  I learned that due to the war between the Jupiterians and the Sun people,  I will have to find the escape pod in the subway before the Earth explodes.  Right behind the ticket booths.  That's right. 
[02:44:30]  Adam from Boston.  I learned that if you're high and listening to the show today, you got a special treat.  And then he writes, I am and I did.  He also learned the password is Al Dukes is gay and a shorty with a 40 will kill you.  Sheep lover.  I learned today the VIP club is a good place to celebrate Mother's Day.  Right.  And Ben is stomping the floor behind me.  I hear you, Ben.  Look at that freak.  Jameek from Brooklyn.  If I pour oil in my lap and start whacking my bag, the cops won't arrest me.  And finally, I learned today, this is Jeremy from Springfield.  If you're going to visit the Forbidden Zone, don't wear white.  Right.

Oh, Ticklekitty.  I get it now.  Oh, I did not get the beautiful.  Oh, you didn't get it.  Come on.  Ticklekitty.  Ticklekitty.  Oh, oh.  And we ran out of time.  Paul Mercurio, once again, you're playing.  Catch Rising Star, Princeton, New Jersey, Wednesday to Saturday.  Come on out.  All right.  Tomorrow is the show we've been waiting for for about a week and a half, Anthony.  Yes.  I'm coming by.  Come on by.  It's the O&A Money Snatch Game tomorrow. 
[02:45:30]  Oh, also, my brother down at Bar 9 tonight on 9th Avenue.  Doing his thing.  Doing his thing.  With Larry.  Right.  Learn.  All right.  All right. </pre>
