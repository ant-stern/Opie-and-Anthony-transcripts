<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast was a whirlwind of chaotic energy, offensive humor, and bizarre tangents.  The show heavily featured “Whip’em Out Wednesday” (WOW), a promotion encouraging women to flash drivers displaying WOW stickers.  The hosts discussed its relaunch in Boston, Philadelphia (sparking a contentious phone call with Philadelphia program director Tim Sabian, who felt neglected), and Washington D.C.,  recounting their Boston history, firing, and current New York success. They announced a New York magazine signing and a Philadelphia "WOW Summit," described as a "reconnaissance probe" possibly involving "naked women on motorcycles."  Numerous callers participated, including Scorch (discussing his firing and current Syracuse show, "Kingdom of Nakedness"), and excited D.C. listeners engaging in the show's drinking game.  The hosts also discussed the departure of wrestler China from the WWF and a Stephen Lynch song, interspersed with GoldenPalace.com and O2Go water advertisements.  Highly offensive language and sexually suggestive topics dominated much of the conversation.

A segment featured calls from two heavily stoned men in Virginia who discussed their drug use, "teen boot camp" shows,  smoking marijuana with Bible pages, a Jesus impersonator website, and church attendance for free food.  A similarly intoxicated caller, Keith, joined the conversation.  The hosts then played a song from *Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back*, leading to discussions about homosexuality and "stinky man-ass."  Two female lifeguards, Allie and Catherine, called in, engaging in sexually suggestive banter. The conversation touched on *Fast Times at Ridgemont High* and the callers' ages.  A fabricated news story about the Olsen twins making a sexually suggestive movie about Jenna Bush was presented, followed by Joe's songs about the Bush and Olsen twins. The fake news was then revealed. A D.C. caller reported WOW campaign success.  Opie's hard drive destruction was discussed, alongside calls from various listeners, including a Northern Virginia police officer, and interspersed Ted Knight impersonations.  Paul Mercurio (from *The Daily Show*) was a studio guest.  A call from a Ronald Reagan impersonator discussed Maureen Reagan's death, his relationship with Nancy Reagan, and his alleged fake Alzheimer's. Planet Java commercials were aired.

Another segment opened with a tasteless joke about a listener's deceased daughter. Liz called to apologize for canceling a "lesbian for a day" segment due to her sister's hospitalization and recounted a disturbing incident involving a man.  The hosts discussed their royalty dispute with Foundry Records over "Demental World" and "Cringe," recounting their on-air criticism. Callers commented on Anthony's previous "Rocco" rant, expressed loyalty, and anticipated the hosts' Boston return. One caller described a near-accident caused by laughing at the show. Mercurio was again present in the studio. Brother Joe performed a James Taylor/DMX mashup, leading to a discussion about shooting up crack houses.  The hosts heavily mocked rival radio personality Rocco, detailing his perceived fake persona, fabricated wedding, and spinelessness regarding Birdsey's firing.  They discussed Rocco's absurd method of choosing a new co-host, Matty, whose seat number was displayed on a plane banner over Fenway Park.  News clips detailing the hosts' Boston firing for an April Fool's Day joke about the mayor's death were played.  Finally, a call from Claire of Toys in Babeland led to explicit discussions of sexual acts and lesbian sex, with vulgar suggestions from both Claire and the hosts.

A further segment detailed sexually explicit conversations about sex toys, particularly strap-on dildos, with Claire from a sex shop.  The discussion covered lesbian sex preferences, dildo types, and pornography. Claire was invited to bring sex toys for the "Lesbian for a Day" segment.  The show then featured calls from heavily intoxicated Virginians, one of whom vomited during the call, and a Philadelphia bachelor party discussing their strip club plans.  The hosts offered humorous advice and jokes about marriage.  The show concluded with "What Did We Learn," followed by Pinnacle Horny Goatweed and Kawasaki Sports Center advertisements.

It's Whip them out Wednesday.  It's Whip them out Wednesday.  Whip them out Wednesday.  Those are real.  Can't see your report.  Oh, dear.  It's Whip them out Wednesday.  It's Whip them out Wednesday. 
[00:01:00]  Yeah.  Whip them out Wednesday.  Huh?  Mm-hmm.  It's Whip them out Wednesday.  Oh, wow.  Whip them out.  Whip them out.  Take your balls and check it out now.  Whip them out.  Whip them out.  Whip them out.  Whip them out.  Whip them out.  We're waiting.  Let's go while we're young.  All right, all right. 
[00:01:30]  We're working on it.  Welcome to the O.P. and Anthony Show.  A-pusa.  A-pusa.  A-pusa.  A-pusa.  Nice.  Got to give out some phone numbers, Anthony.  If you're in the New York area, give us a call.  877-692-1027.  Anywhere else, we want to hear from you just as well.  A different phone number, though.  866-277-4WOW.  That, once again, is 866-277-4WOW.  Yes, it's Whip'em Out Wednesday.  Yes, it is. 
[00:02:00]  And it's hotter than hell today.  Yeah.  We're very excited to bring Whip'em Out Wednesday.  This is the first week for Washington, D.C.  And the first week for some old friends in Boston.  Yeah.  Whip'em Out Wednesday.  And Philadelphia, we didn't forget about you, okay?  Yeah, come on, Philly.  We might have to get the program director of WYSP on the show today.  Yeah.  Because yesterday, we spent a lot of time talking to Boston and Washington, D.C. 
[00:02:30]  Was Tim feeling a little left out of the loop?  It's unbelievable, man.  The program directors, I swear to God, one day you talk about Philadelphia the whole time,  and the next day you've got to hear from the PD of Chicago or Dallas saying,  Hey, man, you forgot about us.  Yeah.  We're feeling slighted.  You don't love us anymore?  So then we'll talk about Chicago and Dallas a little bit, and then it'll be like,  Hey, what's going on with us here in Cleveland, man?  The listeners, though, are cool.  Like, we got a lot of instant feedback calls from Philly yesterday, and they were fine with it. 
[00:03:00]  Yeah.  But it's like the PDs at the stations, like Tim, that get a little upset.  And I walked in at 11.30, the phone is ringing, and it's Tim from WYSP.  Hey, great show yesterday, very interesting.  You made it interesting for everyone else, you know, going back to Boston and talking bad  about the company that, you know, dicked you over and stuff.  Uh-huh.  But you didn't mention Philadelphia yesterday.  We got to mention it every day.  We didn't forget about Philadelphia. 
[00:03:30]  Yeah.  You know?  Yesterday we saw our old chick.  But yesterday was our old girlfriend.  Yesterday was a huge day for us.  Yeah.  This radio show, Opie and Anthony.  Yeah.  You know, we made our names in Boston, and then we got kicked out of town.  Yes.  And then after three years and four months, we're back on the airwaves in Boston.  It's a really big deal.  And, oh, New York's pissed at us, too.  I forgot to tell you.  I know.  Because when we were ranting and raving yesterday, we said that it felt like a prison sentence. 
[00:04:00]  Well, no, you said that.  I want to make this clear.  But I told you, I said, Opie, you sure you want to say it like that, like it was a prison  sentence?  Because now the people in New York are going, oh, for the past three years, we've been  prison for you.  Well, we weren't a good prison.  How's that?  No, that's not what I'm saying, though.  That's a joke.  New York can understand that.  No, it's been a long time.  Yeah.  We were kicked out of Boston, and, you know, it was like being in prison as far as being 
[00:04:30]  on the Boston airwaves.  Exactly.  Okay?  So you're saying New York is like Oz on HBO.  No, I'm not saying that.  No?  No.  We're very happy that we're on in New York.  We're very happy with what we've done so far in New York.  Are you saying?  We're very happy with our New York listeners.  Being here in New York is like some big guy that's been working out for years railing  you in the balloon knot.  Look, man.  Is that it?  Look, man.  Is that what you're trying to say?  Look, man.  You're killing me. 
[00:05:00]  You're killing me.  And I know why.  You're running the fence.  Is it?  Is it?  Have you been shanked at all during the three years?  No?  I think someone can understand what I was saying yesterday.  No one bent you over in the laundry room?  No, nothing like that.  Okay.  I'm just trying to see what you meant about prison.  And why aren't you helping me out with this today?  Because I didn't say it.  I was reading that instant feedback.  Oh, you read that?  Yeah.  Oh, thanks, man.  How's the tossed salad in prison?  Is it good?  Do you like yours with syrup? 
[00:05:30]  No?  No.  We're going to do something special for New York next week.  Oh, great.  Now they're special.  Is that, like, retarded special?  What kind of special?  Hey, man, you've seen some of our listeners.  Hey, I'll agree with you there.  Okay.  I can describe a few of them, sure.  I'll agree with that one.  Ha!  They are the yagas and the...  Come on, we're kidding.  You know we love you.  No, we're going to do something special for New York next week.  We're going to have a magazine signing party.  Yeah, all the different publications we've been in recently.  We're going to take them out to a bar and use that as an excuse to drink. 
[00:06:00]  Yeah, that's really what it is.  Yeah, and you guys know that.  But we've done this plenty of times.  Whenever something happens that we kind of feel good about, we go out to a local bar and we just hang out.  We buy the first round of drinks for the listeners and we just sit there and drink and babble to each other.  It's great.  So we're trying to find a place that can hold a lot of people.  And we're going to do it late next week.  And you come by with whatever magazine you have picked up.  We've been in Penthouse.  Penthouse started it all.  But since then, all within the last four weeks, we've been in Time Magazine, Brill's Content. 
[00:06:30]  What came out this week?  FHM Magazine, the latest issue with Anna Kornikova, we're in that.  Rolling Stone is now hitting the newsstands, the hot issue, we're in that.  And Monday, I believe, the article in New York Magazine comes out.  So late next week, we'll get together and we'll party.  We'll sign some magazines and just have a good old time, okay?  Rolling Stone, the photographer, was in here for how long?  Uh, the whole show. 
[00:07:00]  Yeah.  And he's taking pictures.  Uh, they didn't use any pictures.  They used a picture of some chicks, like, going at it on the floor, which is fine.  I have no problem with that.  Like, I think people would rather see that.  But next time a publication comes in and they want a photographer to take pictures, they get one picture.  We stand there just like when you're hanging out with family for Christmas and you're snapping some pictures.  There isn't not even the one to make sure. 
[00:07:30]  Oh, you don't want it?  Not even the second one.  Okay, just, let me just get another one just in case.  It's the just in case picture.  You don't want to give them the safety pic.  No.  I hate the just in case picture.  Because it's exactly...  All right, hold on.  Click.  All right, no, don't move.  Don't move.  One more just in case.  Just in case of what?  The only time you should do a just in case picture is if you're changing lenses or a camera.  Yeah.  If you're using the exact same camera and you click once and then go, well, just in case. 
[00:08:00]  No, that should...  That's stupid.  Because you can have two pictures of the same goddamn thing.  And it doesn't matter if one has red eye or you're making a stupid face in the other one.  It's going in your photo album.  You know, it's not going anywhere special.  Just in case.  So, anyway, the publications, one picture.  We smile.  Hey, there it is.  Take it.  All right, leave.  Sears portrait.  That's where we're going.  We're going to Glamour Shots.  And I don't know how to tell you this.  We'll get our Glamour Shots and we'll hand them to any of the publications. 
[00:08:30]  I don't know how to tell you this.  I want to wear the big red dress with my teased hair up.  The media blitz is over.  We're not going to be in any other magazines.  Yeah, I know.  It's too late.  I always think of this stuff too late.  You should have came up with this about four weeks ago.  Ass.  The blitz is over.  Now we get the fun publications like Swank and Plumpers wanting to do an article.  Did Plumpers call?  You laugh.  We were in Big Bud Magazine.  Yeah, well, that's because Mendy, the editor, is on our show from time to time.  All right, so where were we?  It's Whip Him Out Wednesday.  Yes.  Yes, it is.  And we're bringing it back to Boston. 
[00:09:00]  This is probably the...  Are we allowed to talk about Boston today, Philly?  Or is Tim Shaving going to get all...  Hey, look.  ...and cry like a little girl in his office?  I don't want to get into it as much as we did yesterday, but, you know, we're reintroducing  Wow, so we'll stick to that.  Right.  But, no, I don't want Tim weeping.  Okay.  I don't want him calling you.  Why don't you call me, Tony?  Tony, you said you were going to call me.  Hey, I was busy.  We're doing something special for Philly next week, matter of fact. 
[00:09:30]  Did Tim walk away down the street with his big platform shoes on and his blazer with  the big wide lapels?  Call me, Tony.  Tony, call me.  All right, I'll call you.  We'll go to the bridge.  Tim's been nothing but supportive, but it was just funny.  I'm like, Tim, it was one show.  We're back in Boston.  This is a big effing deal.  Poor Tim.  Anyway, for Philly next week, we're all over the place, I know, but we'll get on track  here eventually.  We're doing the first ever Wow Summit. 
[00:10:00]  Yeah, I've heard about this.  We're going to have some...  It's like an exchange program, almost.  Not even an exchange program.  I think it's more like we're sending out a probe, Anthony.  A probe?  A probe, yes.  More prison lingo?  No.  A probing?  Yeah, we're sending out a Wow Probe?  Well, we've been in New York for over three years now, and we're excited.  We're being syndicated to all these cities.  Yeah.  And now we've got to kind of get the feeling for what is going on out there.  So we're sending out a little reconnaissance probe.  Like a probe. 
[00:10:30]  And then, yeah, pictures will be sent back to us, and we'll see if it's a safe environment.  Are we going to have a little radio-controlled skateboard like they put on Mars with a camera?  Yeah.  Or is it just going to be naked women on motorcycles?  Naked women on motorcycles.  Yeah, that's what I figured.  Yeah, we've got a bunch of people that are going to be going to Philly.  We're sending out our first satellite.  The first ONA satellite.  That's good.  It's going to be Keith on a Harley with a bunch of girls.  Bunch of girls.  Now, we're going to really organize this. 
[00:11:00]  I think we're going to find a location where Keith is going to leave from next Wednesday, starting right at 3.  And he's going down to Philly to see what kind of response we can get.  Yeah.  So we're sending the satellite toward Philly next week.  Very good.  Oh, look who's on line 12 here.  It's Tim Sabian from WISP in Philadelphia.  Tim, you feeling loved today?  Who's this?  Opie and Anthony.  Who?  The guys that I put all my effort into that treated me like a bald-headed stepchild with big feet? 
[00:11:30]  That left me in the cold for Boston and Washington?  Are these the guys?  Come on, Tom.  You know we love you.  Listen, Bill.  It's all right.  I understand.  Tim's the matter.  I was yesterday's bitch.  You got a little attention.  One night, it's over with between you and I.  Jim, you feel...  A shy, quiet guy from the midway.  Look at how you treat me.  Jim, you feeling loved today?  I don't know if that treats me better than this.  Everything will be okay today, Jim.  Okay.  Jim Sebastian from YSP.  We love him. 
[00:12:00]  What's the matter?  A little attention goes somewhere else for a little while and you're getting all weepy on us.  This Fred and Bob show is terrific.  Fred and Bob.  Slappy and whappy to you.  You feeling good, though?  You getting a nice response now from the people of Philly?  It's starting to get some traction.  Yeah, we kind of like it.  Yeah, I do, too.  Getting a lot of feedback here at the station.  I smell ratings.  Feeling the love.  There's nothing like the smell of ratings in the morning.  Yeah, well, Tim, slow down.  Tim, are you going to... 
[00:12:30]  I'll get my Harley out.  Yes, we'll meet.  You tell me where, when.  All right, yeah.  We're sending out the satellite next Wednesday.  You need Wall Stickers.  Tim's going to roll up on his big wheel.  That hurt.  You got a bike, Tim?  Absolutely.  You really do?  Yeah, absolutely.  What kind?  It's a Harley.  Oh, really?  This is the first...  Soft tail.  This is the first WOW Summit ever, you know.  I can't wait.  If it works well in Philly, we're going to bring it to other cities. 
[00:13:00]  I love it.  All right.  Let's roll.  All right.  Rolling thunder.  We're going to stop talking about Philly now.  That's it?  Yeah, we put in the minimum amount of time.  Oh, come on.  Come on.  Go easy on me.  Don't worry.  You know you's one of our favorite bitches.  I got enough aggravation in my life.  Come on.  Who do we take to bed once a week?  Hey, but I'm good.  Tim.  Men know what men like.  You ain't like the hoes we just put out.  Stop.  Stop.  Actually, you're the first hoes, so you're getting a little skanky. 
[00:13:30]  We got some new bitches in Boston.  Yeah.  They're young and fine.  Brand new ones to the stable, and the Washington ones nice.  You'll always be the first.  There's nothing like the first.  The first syndicated city was Philly.  There's nothing like the first.  All right, Tim.  We got to let you go.  All right, Doctor.  Have a good one.  We got to try to figure out what we're doing.  See you next Wednesday.  All right.  Are you coming down?  No, because we're going to do the show from here, and we're going to get reports from  the bikes and stuff.  You don't send a manned space capsule first.  You send the monkey out. 
[00:14:00]  Yeah.  This is just a probe we're sending out to see how things are going.  Gotcha.  Toe in the water.  If they come back with a positive experience, then the next step is to send some astronauts.  There you go.  All right.  All right, Tim.  Okay.  Bye.  Bye.  There he goes.  Now let's go talk to our nice new tight-ass bitch.  What, Tim?  He's feeling a little neglected.  Yeah, well.  Had to talk him up a little bit.  He gets lonely over there in Philly, doesn't he? 
[00:14:30]  What station were we just talking to?  Ah, the phones aren't working.  Oh, what?  The national lines are screwing up on us?  Yeah.  All right, Anthony.  You want to explain Whip Him Out Wednesday for the first time to Washington, D.C.?  A lot of old friends in Boston will know exactly what this is about, because we  started it up there in Boston six years ago.  What a concept this is.  A lot of radio stations put out their bumper stickers and whatnot, and they tell you to  drive around with it, and maybe, I don't know, their van might be out somewhere.  Needle in a haystack are winning anything. 
[00:15:00]  Doesn't work.  With Whip Him Out Wednesday, the greatest radio promotion ever, this is the deal.  You put a wow in your vehicle, whether it's one of our bumper stickers, or you just  put it in the dirt on the back of your truck, you write it on a piece of cardboard  and slip it in your back window of your car.  Duct tape.  Duct tape.  Doesn't matter.  If there's a wow on your vehicle and you drive around, if ladies feel so inclined, they  see the wow, pull up next to you, and flash you their beautiful breasts.  And what better way to make the commute a little easier? 
[00:15:30]  You know?  And you never know when it's going to happen.  You put it on your car.  You forget about it.  You just drive around.  All of a sudden, it could be days.  Could be weeks.  Could be months later.  But you're driving.  All of a sudden, you look to your side.  There's a girl flashing her beautiful breasts at you.  And you go, what?  What is this?  What?  I don't know.  Oh, my God.  I just got wowed.  Yeah.  And it freaks you out.  Two rules.  Don't follow the ladies and don't harass the ladies.  There's plenty of ladies out there that will do this.  Yeah.  You just drive.  You put the wow in your car and you just drive. 
[00:16:00]  You do nothing else.  It's the easiest thing ever to do.  And this started six years ago when we were up in Boston.  And just when it was getting huge, Dave Dickless being the pussy that he is, the amoeba.  Yeah.  The program director with no backbone pulled it, suspended us because we refused to stop it.  It was too much fun.  And wow went away.  Too much fun for him.  Until we came to New York and worked for a company and a couple of people that fully understand what we do.  And they embraced it.  And as we sit here, three years later, since coming to New York, it is huge. 
[00:16:30]  Beyond huge.  To the point we have a three-story by three-story wow billboard in the middle of Times Square.  In the middle of Times Square.  Doesn't get much better than that, Anthony.  And New York City buses have the huge bus boards on the back with the wows.  I'm hearing that buses full of people are being wowed on the streets of New York City, which is hysterical.  It cracks me up.  It's great.  So wow is back in Boston. 
[00:17:00]  And we couldn't be happier.  Yep.  It's going to start up in Washington, D.C.  It'll spread like crazy in Boston because they already know what it's about.  Washington is going to take some time because we've got to teach the ladies what this is all about.  But before you go in, you've got to get the wow signs on your cars.  But it will happen.  You'll see the wow stickers showing up maybe on the presidential motorcade.  Could you imagine that?  Pulling into the White House?  Wow right on there?  Maybe on his helicopter?  That would be great.  Yeah.  So it's day one for Washington.  So give it some time, all right?  Let's go to the phones. 
[00:17:30]  Billy, what's going on?  Hey, what's up, Opie?  Hey, man.  Hey, I remember you guys when you guys were on AF.  Yeah.  I kicked ass.  But now since that ridiculous Dave fired you.  Dave.  He made you guys even better.  Yeah.  You know, if he's to be thanked for anything, it's for being a spineless worm that fired us,  that allowed us to be fired, that didn't stand up for us.  Because it was the best thing that ever happened to us.  It was the best thing that ever happened to us, us being released from under his reign. 
[00:18:00]  His paranoia, his clutches.  Other people decide they just want to stay there and rot away in their chairs like Rock Hole.  But thank you.  Thank you, Dave, for being a spineless worm bastard and not standing up for your talent so we could be fired.  Come here and have the opportunity to come back three years later and kick your narrow ass.  That's right.  There you go.  That's right. 
[00:18:30]  And you won't be hearing Ass Whipping Wednesday.  No.  On our show.  We try to give our listeners some fun things on the drive home.  The ladies, too.  They like, a lot of the ladies like seeing a nice pair of breasts, too.  Don't they, Opie?  Yes.  We've realized that.  Yes.  And it's a great little thing on the way home.  You never know when it's going to happen.  Whip them out Wednesday.  People love it.  And it doesn't include any old man ass.  No.  Which I like.  No.  We learned a long time ago that guys don't really want to hear old, fatty, sweaty guys  getting their ass whipped on a Wednesday. 
[00:19:00]  I like the fact that it does not include man ass.  Jim, what's going on?  Yo, guys.  Hey.  Hey, remember, Tim Sabian was the one that approved the Grease Man.  Hi.  Yeah, what's the problem there?  I love Tim Sabian there.  Waddle doodle.  He's got a Harley with training wheels.  Bone dry.  So what's up, Jim?  Hey, you know, Philadelphia loves hearing about the past.  We'd love to hear why you guys are the way you are today.  Well, you know what it is? 
[00:19:30]  It's kind of hard to just come into these new cities and not kind of explain a few things.  And like you said, to give people an understanding of what we're about now.  But we try to do it in a way where it's kind of relatable and entertaining to all the cities  that don't know what the F we're talking about, you know?  And in light of yesterday, are there any politicians that died that we should be aware of?  Everyone always asks that.  Yeah.  We're going to leave the mayors alone for a while.  Now, this one, believe me, I think Giuliani here in New York wishes he was dead because he's 
[00:20:00]  gone through a living hell.  Well, I hear that both you and he are going to be giving interviews at Blue Boy.  There you have it.  All right, Jim, thank you.  Thanks.  Just as simple as this, we were never appreciated when we were in Boston.  Yeah.  And that's why we're getting back at the old station that did us wrong.  I think a lot of people can relate to that.  Yeah.  You get fired from a job, maybe a job that you thought you were doing real well at.  And then, you know, how many of us really get the chance to shove it back in their face?  Well, without some type of prison sentence, too, because usually if you go bursting in 
[00:20:30]  with a gun or something, well, I would say that was a payback.  But then, yeah, you know, you either shoot yourself in the head or you go to prison.  This is a great way to get back and stay free.  Anthony, an old friend checking in.  Hey, Scorch, what's going on?  Hey, boys, congratulations on everything that's going on in your life.  Scorch.  Scorch, totally new radio.  Hey, man, it's good to be with ONA one more time.  The kingdom of nakedness.  Kingdom of nakedness.  Hey, Scorch, you know, you're talking to Boston right now. 
[00:21:00]  Oh, man, it's good to be home.  You know, I never even got a chance to say bye to Boston because, as it turned out, I  was a pizza chef and not a hamburger chef.  Now, Scorch, who fired you from WAAF?  Oh, you know the man.  Can I say it?  Dave Dickless.  Yeah, Dave Dickless did it to me, too, man.  And I agree with you.  You know what?  I ended up in Syracuse, New York.  But you know what?  I'm doing a million times better than anybody there is.  You're doing the kingdom of nakedness.  Yeah, things are going okay, man.  I mean, I'm making six figures.  Did anybody at AAF make six figures other than... 
[00:21:30]  Hey, I make six figures, but the decimals are a few places over it.  And as far as I've been listening to what you've been saying about Rocco and stuff,  and it's kind of like, I think that it was a nasty situation, and I'm glad you're going  to kick his ass.  That's a good thing.  Yeah, it's going to get a kick there.  It's going to get ugly.  He doesn't even know.  Doesn't even know.  Has he lost any weight yet?  Who knows?  He's going to lose his ratings, though.  He's definitely going to lose his ratings.  Scorch, Scorch, Scorch, Scorch. 
[00:22:00]  Let me keep you on track here.  Why don't you tell everyone how you got fired, because it's a great story.  Okay, I got fired.  I walked in.  At this point, I had been in radio for two or three years.  I walked in, and I said, hey, you know what?  You guys are kind of treating me not that good.  Can I ask you, is my job safe?  Well, Mr. Dickler said, well, I can't guarantee you're going to be here in a year.  Of course, he's looking up at the ceiling the whole time, because he's one of those people  that can't look at you straight in the face.  A worm, a spineless scumbag.  Oh, no doubt.  Anyway, so I said, okay, I don't have a year. 
[00:22:30]  How long do I have?  He says, well, the better part of a month.  The better part of a month.  Which is not even a month.  Yeah, I mean, okay, yeah, when it's the 23rd, you know the better part of a month.  It's okay, you're done in like six days.  Right.  Can you tell me why everything I thought was going good?  Here's the great logic.  This is the great part.  Well, and he's looking up in the ceiling, scratching his chin, saying to himself,  as you can see it in his head, he's like, goddammit, I'm lying, and I know it.  He says, hamburgers, you're pizza. 
[00:23:00]  Right now, I'm in the mood for a great hamburger.  And I hope he's listening to this, because he's got to remember this story.  It's the stupidest way to fire anybody I've ever heard of my wife.  Hamburgers, you're pizza.  Right now, I'm in the mood for a great hamburger.  If I was in the mood for some good pizza, though, I'll tell you what, Scorch,  I'd pick you, because you're the best pizza man in the business.  Right now, I want a hamburger.  And that's the way I got fired, our market number seven.  Did you just want to kick him in the nuts at that point?  I kind of wonder if there was one day, and I think you guys were with us,  we're at a restaurant, Framingham or something, and we didn't realize he was there with his wife, 
[00:23:30]  and we're all getting tanked, and we're just, like, making fun of him.  And I think he might have heard me.  Ah.  Scott, his wife, who I believe was programming the station, you know, we'd do some things,  and I think it didn't click well with her.  She would rag him about it, and he would try to make a stop.  And I really wanted to set up Bruce, too, but I was good, and I didn't do that.  I could have done that as well.  It was just a nasty thing, but I'm glad you're there, man. 
[00:24:00]  Hey, Scorch Pizza.  Hey, it's Scorch Pizza.  So let me tell people, krock.com, if you can punch it up.  Well, because I've got to plug my own station, too.  That's just one of those things.  All right.  You're up in Syracuse.  You're going to come by next week, right?  Yeah.  I'm going to probably come in Monday.  Is that cool with you guys?  Right on, man.  Hell, yeah.  Totally nude.  I'll be in there.  I'll be in there Monday afternoon, definitely.  All right.  We've got to let you go, dude.  We've got a show to do.  Thanks, everybody.  All right.  Peace, guys.  There he goes, an old friend, Scorch.  Yeah, Scorch.  He told me I was pizza. 
[00:24:30]  Pizza.  He does totally nude radio in Syracuse, New York.  My show's called The Kingdom of Nakedness.  It was funny when Ed and I were driving to Boston for the first time, and I think Scorch  was on the radio when we were going to interview and stuff.  And we hear Scorch doing, yeah, I'm Scorch.  I'm completely naked.  This is the kingdom of nakedness.  Totally nude radio.  And we're going to meet this guy soon because we're driving to the station.  I'm like, oh, God.  What is this?  We're going to walk in.  He's going to be naked.  Naked.  We've got to get him on the air to talk about wrestling. 
[00:25:00]  Supposedly, he knows Triple H real well.  Yeah.  And a bunch of the guys.  Speaking of that, you hear China's out.  That's old news, really.  Yeah, but they finally really announced it.  Yeah, her contract's up in November, but they're not going to do anything else with her.  And she can't use the China name.  No.  Stupidest move she...  Well, can you...  See, what happened was she, you know, there was something going on with her contract that  couldn't work out terms. 
[00:25:30]  And Vince said, all right, well, see you later.  Goodbye, China.  Does everyone remember Sable?  Take your bra off and take it off now.  Sable thought she was going to be, you know, somebody after the WWF.  Yeah.  And then she couldn't use the Sable name.  So now what?  She's going to have to go around as...  What's her new real name?  Joanie?  Joanie.  Joanie?  Joanie, yeah.  She's China.  I know.  And all of a sudden you see her as Joanie.  I don't think it's going to wash.  And like Ovi said, yeah, remember Sable?  Where'd she go?  I know she's a nice lady, but she is just completely effed. 
[00:26:00]  Wait a minute.  This is for all the men who want to see me and all the women who want to be me.  You want to see my grind?  Ugh!  Remember that from Sable?  Where is she now?  Nowhere.  And China with that horrible lisp of hers.  Who's going to pick her up for some acting roles?  Baby talk, baby talk.  It's a wonder you can walk.  So.  You shut up, buddy Hinton.  I hear she's really nice.  I wish her the best, but my God. 
[00:26:30]  Well, she's going to go into acting.  Then you'll learn from Sable.  And it's the exact same thing.  Sable did a couple of those guest spots on things like, you know, Baywatch or whatever the hell it is.  And did the Playboy like China did.  The Playboy.  And then all of a sudden they think, you know, they start hearing things that they're going to be in movies and TV shows.  They leave WWF, which is the meal ticket, and they fade away.  And then they end up like that.  What's her name?  That was at the Mega Loser show there at the Meadowlands recently.  What was her name?  Cindy Williams?  No, the blonde.  Yeah, Cindy Williams has been.  No, who's the blonde that used to be on that? 
[00:27:00]  Sonny?  Sonny.  Yeah, Sonny's a mess now.  All right.  Maybe Norm would call her a crack whore.  All right.  We have to take our first break, but Whip Him Out Wednesday makes its return to Boston, the place where it all began.  Please put wow in the back of your car any way you can.  You guys know how to do it.  Homemade wow signs, whatever.  It also shows that you're supporting the return of Opie and Anthony to Boston, okay?  Mm-hmm.  And we'll be back.  There's so much to get to today.  So much.  Breaking news.  We got breaking news?  On what? 
[00:27:30]  Breaking Olsen twin news.  All right, all right.  That's a good tease.  We'll be back.  There's a car with a wow next to me.  Put out your cans.  Pull out your fun bags.  What are you waiting for?  Do it.  Do it now.  I'm wowing.  You look fabulous.  Opie and Anthony.  We love seeing boobs.  Well, duh.  102.7 WNEW announces our new fall lineup.  Sports Guys Mornings.  Don and Mike, Middays.  Opie and Anthony Afternoons.  Ron and Fez. 
[00:28:00]  Nights.  102.7 WNEW.  Anthony, O2Go.  O2Go.  It's distilled water, which usually tastes like crap, but the O2Go figured out a way.  They oxygenate the water up to eight times more oxygen than any other bottled water.  Anthony, what am I drinking right now?  O2Go.  How's that feeling?  With the oxygen.  You digging it?  You know, I'm learning something.  I can't taste oxygen.  Yeah.  What does oxygen taste like?  It just makes the water taste better.  Oh, okay. 
[00:28:30]  And they have new flavors, too.  O2Go.  Cranberry.  Lemon, lime.  No calories.  If you're drinking flavored water with calories, switch to O2Go.  It's light, crisp.  No aftertaste.  And this stuff will boost your energy, your stamina.  Keeps you focused and alert.  Like I said, five to eight more times the oxygen than any other bottled water.  And oxygen, like I've said, my personal favorite gas out of all of the gases, oxygen, followed  by nitrogen, and then hydrogen.  Save that for a trivia question. 
[00:29:00]  O2Go.  Opie, Anthony.  Opie, Anthony.  Opie, Anthony.  1027.  WNEW.  That's the latest from STP, Anthony.  A little taste.  Hollywood bitch.  This is the Opie and Anthony show.  Hello.  If you want to get a hold of us, and you're not in the New York area, 866-277-4WOW.  Let's check in with Virginia.  Sean, what's up?  Hey, what's up, Opie? 
[00:29:30]  What's up?  We're playing the Opie and Anthony drinking game over here.  Yeah, that's a cool game.  Wait, this is only the third show you've heard, right?  Yes.  And you guys already know about the Opie and Anthony drinking game?  Yeah, we checked out the website.  It's crazy time.  You get hammered with that drinking game.  Opie just did like 18 scorch impressions.  Yeah, when Opie does an impression on the drinking game, you have to drink.  It was insane.  Hold on, wait.  My friend Dennis is playing.  He wants to talk to you. 
[00:30:00]  All right.  Your impressions are worse than my father dying of ALS, also known as Lou Gehrig, three years ago.  Thank you.  Lou Gehrig got that Lou Gehrig's disease.  What are the odds of that?  You guys sound hammered.  Oh, dude.  What are you, Jager?  Jager.  Jager is like the ultimate when you want to get hammered.  Hey, we're going to get along with Washington.  I just figured out. 
[00:30:30]  Washington rules.  What are some of the other things you've had to drink to?  We drank to Anthony doing impressions and...  Yeah, but that's just little sips because Anthony's supposed to be impressions on the show, right.  What else, the station, the new station IDs we're drinking to?  Oh, any time you hear a new station?  Oh, what's the wow index, man?  We didn't get the drink for that yet today.  Wow index today is a 10.  Yeah, it's a perfect 10.  We only got one drink.  You guys going to get wow on the back of your rides?  Yeah, do we have it already? 
[00:31:00]  Already?  It's only been two days.  So we made some signs out of pizza boxes and...  This is the best.  You guys are hammered, man.  You guys have got to come see us.  Yeah, where are you, man?  We're in your house, man.  Oh, no.  We're in the closet.  Look over there.  Yeah, we're going to take some bong heads now, man.  You sound like you need it.  I was just about to ask if you guys are potheads.  You don't even know. 
[00:31:30]  We got a game that you guys can play.  Oh, no.  We got a game that you guys can play.  We're going to put you on hold because the next time we play this game, you guys are so in, okay?  Oh, yeah, we'll get like your phone number.  Should we wait on this phone, man?  Yeah.  It's called Stoner Spelling Bee.  Oh, nice, dude.  We get you guys really wasted and then you spell words and stuff.  We did our heads.  Yes, you did.  Fulfilled their obligation.  So what do you think of the show after two days?  I think it's awesome, man. 
[00:32:00]  There was nothing on the radio down here before.  All right, right on.  All sorts of boobs.  I could talk to these guys all day.  Don't you just want to go over there and hang out and drink?  Hell, yeah.  Hell, yeah.  You guys watching any films later?  I don't.  We've been putting the PCR before.  Oh, no.  He said the F word.  That's right.  I don't know.  FCC regulation.  Yeah, you don't want to mess with the FCC, my friend. 
[00:32:30]  Oh, no way.  Yeah.  Oh, man, we got new stoner friends from Washington.  That's cool.  Sean, what's your friend's name?  Dennis.  Dennis and Sean?  Yeah.  All right.  Dennis and Sean from Virginia.  We'll remember you guys.  And when we play Stoner Spelling Bee, we'll call you up.  So hold on.  We'll get your phone number.  All right.  Yeah, call back later and tell us how the show's going today.  We will, man.  All right.  So later on.  Pinky rules.  These guys get it already, man. 
[00:33:00]  That's hysterical.  You guys ever make it to New York?  I was there when I was like eight, and there was a bunch of hookers and stuff.  New York has changed.  Now there's Disney stores all over the place.  Oh, B, dude.  Yeah.  Let me do this for you.  Hold on.  All right.  All right.  All right.  All right.  All right.  All right.  All right.  All right.  All right.  All right.  All right.  All right.  All right.  That sounds like a good one, huh? 
[00:33:30]  I feel stoned-er already.  Stoned-er.  That even works every day.  Yeah, it works.  Wait.  I got to play a public service announcement for you guys.  Oh, I know.  Maybe these guys need to hear the public service announcement.  Yes.  Hold on.  I got to play this for you.  Marijuana is a narcotic, medically and legally.  It never did anybody any good, and does everybody a lot of harm. 
[00:34:00]  Still Friday, man.  Yeah, it hurt my school career.  Hold on.  Wait.  Ready?  I got one for you.  Oh, hold on.  All right.  Another Milwaukee's Best getting open, right?  Milwaukee's Best.  The Beast is least.  You guys can't afford beer or what?  No, man.  We're stoners.  We just had a drink all day.  Where did you get the money to even buy that?  Like couch cushions, bummed it from friends. 
[00:34:30]  My mom gave me $10 last week.  It was sweet.  Hey.  How much does a six-old Milwaukee cost?  Oh, the 30-pack is like $8 down here.  I don't even mess with the Sixers, man.  No.  Hey, listen.  Make sure you give Rick your address.  We're going to send you a case of Sam Adams, man.  Nice.  Yeah, we'll ship you a case of Sam.  Oh, beauty, dude.  And maybe Stinky will slip a little something in there for you as well, okay?  We're going to send us beer, man. 
[00:35:00]  Thank God.  Do you guys have any, like, stupid jobs just to pass the day?  Yeah, I work at this dating service, man.  You work at a dating service?  Yeah.  Oh, no, wait.  I quit because I couldn't listen to two hours of your show.  Well, what did you do at this dating service?  I talked old divorced women into, like, getting it on with young men.  Hey, rock on.  Right?  That's not a bad business.  It was a bug. 
[00:35:30]  And what did your friend do?  I don't know.  I don't think he does anything, man.  Doesn't even know.  Don't you guys, like, kind of room together?  Yeah, he lives upstairs, man.  Oh, yeah?  Hey, what do you do, dude?  Nothing.  Oh, yeah?  He doesn't have a job either, man.  He got fired.  Nothing.  All right.  These guys are exactly like I was.  I swear to God.  This is how I spent my whole 20s.  It's good times, man.  Every day when I was in my 20s was spent just like this.  This is reminding me of those years in the fraternity house in Geneseo. 
[00:36:00]  Hanging out doing nothing at the Phi Sig house.  You guys rule.  Frat boy.  You've been so many movies made about guys like this.  Hysterical.  All right, my new friends.  We're going to put you on hold.  Rick's going to talk to you.  Hold on, man.  Nice.  And we're going to send you some stuff and we're going to try to get you to New York or something.  I don't know.  Awesome, dude.  Yeah, right on.  Peace.  All right.  There you go.  There go the stoners from Virginia. 
[00:36:30]  Yeah.  We got some new friends.  That's funny, man.  They're hanging.  I like that.  Enjoying life.  All right.  Let's do it.  Kevin, what's going on?  Hey, Opie and Anthony.  What's up, man?  What's happening?  Long time no hair.  Yeah, no crap.  Dude, you guys are saving lives up here in Boston.  Oh, cool, man.  We're back and we're not going anywhere.  This is our show now.  And police supporters put the wow back on the car, right?  Oh, dude, well, I never left.  I drive a truck on the Big Dig and people still got it on there. 
[00:37:00]  Unless you want to hear, you know, guys getting whipped in the ass, you know.  That might be more your style.  Hey, that's great stuff.  Run with them.  Ozone was the last remaining thing to listen for and he's gone.  Ozone, another guy we worked with at WAF at the time.  We like Ozone.  We still do.  And we never, you know, we never, like, bitched about him at all.  I was supposed to hook up with him in New York, here in New York, a few weeks back.  And the schedule's conflicted.  But, you know, I still do the guy.  He's great to party with, man. 
[00:37:30]  I'll tell you that one.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  I remember up the beach dig one time.  We all went over to 10's and, oh, I think even your girl got in a fight with one of the strippers.  Oh, my.  Oh, remember that time?  Yeah.  Was it 10's?  Holy.  Yeah.  That was a 10's show club.  That was like 96 maybe, 97.  You remember that?  We went into a strip club.  Was it 10's?  Totally nude girl.  Right up in Salisbury Beach, right?  Yep.  And, oh, my God.  That's right.  They talked my girlfriend into going into the strip club. 
[00:38:00]  She wasn't thrilled.  With everybody.  I walk in.  Oh, man.  I walk in, and I was just staring at a beer tap because as soon as she saw me looking at  any of the girls, it was the biggest effing nightmare.  What a scene.  Yeah.  It was a bad scene back then.  And then the girls wanted to come up and say hi to us because they're listeners.  So they're like, and you know strippers, they're pressing their cans against you, getting  body glitter all over you.  Just like, hi.  I listen every day.  And the chicks are just looking like, ah, ah. 
[00:38:30]  Oh, if your girl had a knife, that would have been one bleeding stripper.  Yeah.  That was funny as hell.  That was a bad scene.  But, Kev, yeah, we're back, and we're going to come visit very, very soon.  I'm psyched.  I think we're going to just throw a little concert together.  That's what I'm thinking.  Absolutely.  Hey, does this mean my autographed copy of Demented World is, like, priceless now?  Uh, pretty much, because we don't really promote that CD anymore, because they decided to stop  paying us.  Dave Dickless had something to do with that, by the way.  Yeah.  Douche.  But he can't understand why we hate him.  Who can't? 
[00:39:00]  All right, Kevin.  We got to fly, but put the wow on your car.  We're back.  Awesome.  Will do.  Love you guys.  That'll support the show.  Thanks, Kev.  All right.  Yes, Rick?  Uh, we have to have the stoner guys call back.  Oh, I hung up on them by accident?  No, you put them on hold.  They picked them up to get the phone number.  I guess they got halfway through the number, and they hung up the phone.  They got to call back.  They got to call back with their phone number.  Oh, my God.  I hope they're listening.  Yeah, we'll get them.  I'm sure we'll get them.  I'm sure we'll get them.  Holy Dude Radio.  That was really funny. 
[00:39:30]  I just love that people could hang out and have fun like that.  All right, let's go to Sinclair.  Sinclair.  Yeah, fellas.  What's up?  Hey, checking in from D.C. here, Skinny Sinclair.  Hey, I want to let you know I dig the show.  Two days into it, hook like a fish.  You hear me?  Okay.  Fellas.  That's very funny.  Hold on.  I've got a question for you, quickly.  Let us in on the gag.  Yeah, go ahead.  What's that?  Let us in on the gag.  No gag.  You're doing some kind of gag.  Let us in on the gag.  No gag.  No gag.  That must be somebody down there.  I've got a question for you. 
[00:40:00]  That's what it is.  Wait, wait.  Are you advertising for another radio show or something?  Hell no.  Just let us in on the gag.  Hey, Donald Mike won't own real big out there, huh?  He's doing something like, I guess, some guy that's down there, I think.  What's your fake name?  No, Skinny Sinclair is a name.  It's a real name.  Uh-huh.  All right.  Hey, Anthony.  Anthony.  Thanks for the call, man.  I've got a question for you, quickly.  Thanks for the call, dude.  Hey, yesterday.  Yesterday's show.  You there?  Yeah, go.  Yesterday's show.  Comedian singing a song for a six-year-old daughter. 
[00:40:30]  Who is that?  Where can I hear that again?  Can you play it?  Oh, that's Stephen Lynch.  Stephen Lynch.  Yeah, we're going to play a lot of it.  We'll play another little song from him.  Oh, please.  Yeah, Stephen's a good friend of ours, good friend of the show.  I was going to call yesterday.  This time, I'm all set.  I've got the tape player queued up, ready to go.  Let's play If I Were Gay for this guy, all right?  Oh, I appreciate that, fella.  I thought it was a new game you had open.  No, no, no.  The song.  Okay.  I was confused.  Hey, that's a good game.  I want to play it.  We'll play you a different track from his, well, it's all the stuff he did on our show.  He's a great friend of the show.  He has a website, stephenlynch.com. 
[00:41:00]  I'll check that out.  He spells Stephen, S-T-E-P-H-E-N.  Okay.  Lynch.com, okay?  Cool.  But here's another one, and we'll be back.  Thank you.  I don't know if he was, like, you know, messing with us or not.  That's one of the hazards of being in so many cities, okay?  All right, here's Stephen Lynch, If I Were Gay.  This is a song that I wrote, actually, a couple days ago after, excuse me, a friend of mine,  and my best friend, we went out to a bar, and we got really hammered, and we just had  a really good time, and I realized, you know, why not write a song about the good times 
[00:41:30]  that you have with your pal when you're out drinking at night, you know what I mean?  Sure.  And so I wrote this for my best friend, my friend.  That should be cute.  I'm going to play that now.  Let's touch it.  I hope he's listening.  If you are, man, this one's for you.  Here we are, dear old friend, you and I, drunk again. 
[00:42:00]  Laughs have been had, tears have been shed, maybe the whiskey's gone to my hand.  But if I were gay, I would give you my heart.  And if I were gay, you'd be my work of art.  And if I were gay, we would swim in romance.  But I'm not gay, so get your hand out of my pants. 
[00:42:30]  Laughs  It's not that I don't care.  I do  I just don't see myself in you  Another time  Another scene  I'd be right behind you  If you know what I mean  Cause if I were gay 
[00:43:00]  I would give you my soul  And if I were gay  I would give you my whole being  And if I were gay  We would tear down the walls  But I'm not gay  So won't you stop cupping my hand  It's radio  We've never hugged  We've never kissed  I've never been intimate 
[00:43:30]  With your s***  But you have opened  Brand new doors  Get over here  And drop your dress  And drop your dress  And drop your face  Where are you  And drop the walls  And drop your hands  And drop your hair  And drop your eyes  And drop your face 
[00:44:00]  Bravo  Thank you  I noticed a little theme in a lot of your music.  You know, I realize that, too.  Yeah.  So you've got some issues.  Maybe a couple of issues.  Yeah.  A few there.  Okay.  Deal with those, I guess.  You're secure in your manhood.  I guess that's fine.  And I am.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  What do you do here?  Look at breasts.  If I wasn't on this show, I'd be out there with a wow sticker just trolling for breasts.

New York.  And we're back with the Opie and Anthony show.  We got the stoners back on the line because they hung up.  Trying to get their phone number.  I believe it's Dennis.  Dennis, what's up? 
[00:46:00]  Hey, buddy.  Are you the other stoner?  Yeah, yeah.  Dumb and dumb over here.  Dropped the phone.  Where is he?  Back in the bowl.  Where it is, buddy?  Ready, sit, and go.  Excellent.  You're on the radio, man.  I am on the radio.  Can I hold the phone up to the bonkers?  Yes, yes.  Oh, the bonkers.  Hey, this is for Stinky.  All right.  Take it, stupid.  I didn't throw up in the sink, dude. 
[00:46:30]  No way.  I didn't throw up in the sink, man.  He didn't throw up.  He was too busy putting applesauce on my face.  What the hell is that about?  We had a little fun with the fire extinguisher.  Yeah?  With the other one.  And he got pissed at me at like 6 in the morning.  And I took a jar of applesauce and put it on my head.  While you were sleeping?  Yeah. 
[00:47:00]  So I took the jar and threw it at him.  And hit him in the back of the leg.  You guys got to send some pictures.  Hey, you guys got to send some pictures up to New York so we can put it on our website.  Yo, I got so many pictures.  This kid passed out.  It was like all sorts of crap on him.  Do you do it?  We had a friend named Dan.  Yeah.  He's in a band actually called Escoffleys.  Okay.  So Dan's listening.  Hey.  But no, he was passed out and Dan's like 6, 4, 300 pounds. 
[00:47:30]  Yeah.  And we just got a picture of Dan just squatting his ass over his passed out face.  Always funny.  Always funny.  Oh, hold on.  One more.  All right.  Oh, you got the bars.  Our new friends.  We'll get out of the hotline to be with a butthead, man.  Yeah, dude.  Yeah, right on.  Where's your friend?  What's up?  Where's your friend?  Because he called me a pussy because I was in a frat. 
[00:48:00]  Yeah, go pick up some marshmallows.  We heard about that.  Not every frat does the marshmallow trick, my friend.  We heard about that.  Pick up some marshmallows.  Not every fraternity does the marshmallow trick, my friend.  What is the marshmallow?  I'm not.  Explain.  Please explain.  I'm not talking.  I was going to tell your friend that I was in a cool frat.  Doesn't it wind up in an ass crack?  Yeah, and you, yeah. 
[00:48:30]  Yeah, I've heard some things, Anthony.  Yeah.  I just want to tell your friend that I was in a cool frat.  We had guys that, like, you know, they dropped acid and then burned Bibles.  That's cool, right?  I guess.  Hey, stupid, come here.  Hey, hey.  You call each other stupid?  Yeah.  What's his nickname?  He's got a bunch.  Yeah?  Stupid, dummy, drunkard, jackass.  Jackass, okay.  Hold on.  All right.  Take this one.  Hey, yo.  Hey, Sean. 
[00:49:00]  Hey, stupid.  Yo, buddy.  What's up?  How's it hanging, man?  Hey, do you have anything you ever want to maybe do?  Um, not really.  I kind of would like to try, like, some new drugs or something.  There's no career or any job you might think would be cool to have?  I aspire to do, like, eight hits of medicine at once, because that would just, you know?  But you really, there's no drive there or ambition to maybe do something?  Nah, man.  I got a foosball table in my dining room. 
[00:49:30]  All right.  Screw me.  Yeah, man.  I'm okay, dude.  Don't worry about it.  All right.  Hey, we got a foosball table right outside the studio.  Yeah.  No.  How fun is that?  Oh, it's great.  You front or back on foosball?  No, I always take back, dude.  Yeah.  Oh, pardon.  I almost hurled on the phone.  Hey, how did you find out about us?  My friend who went up to school in, like, New York at Iona, he said the show was pretty 
[00:50:00]  sweet, so I decided to tune in, man.  All right.  Cool.  And it beat, like, watching Sally Jesse and Raphael and drinking, you know?  Those teen boot camp things are pretty cool sometimes.  Those chicks are hot, man.  Aren't they?  Like, my 14-year-old daughter dresses too sexy?  Yeah, isn't that the best show?  I love that show, man.  And then, like, they come on and they're dressed all hot and they're flipping off the audience.  And the audience is pissed.  I'd be up there clapping going, yeah, you rule. 
[00:50:30]  We're going to get along with you just fine.  You're the best.  You're the coolest man.  And then they dress them up like a bunch of dorks at the end of the show.  They give them, like, a makeover or something, and they get them crying, and they put them  in these things like they're ready to go to work at IBM or something.  I like them in the slut outfits.  They give them one outfit to go back to their trailer with, man.  Yeah, they give them the one pantsuit.  One smart little outfit.  It's like, oh, you'll be the talk of the double wide, I swear.  For like a day, and then they're back to the little ass skirt. 
[00:51:00]  Hey, I think we just found a new radio show for this nation.  Hell yeah.  Yeah.  You guys want to do mornings?  Yeah.  Yeah, can we have a job, man?  I need a job where I can smoke dope and drink at, man.  Hey, you just found the O.P. and Anthony show.  That's pretty much what we do.  You should see our stairwell.  What a kiss of these guys on, man.  Hey, I just wanted to ask you if this is cool, because I was in a fraternity, right?  And you made fun of me?  Yeah, I did.  Well, we were in a cool fraternity.  Like, I had a guy that would drop acid and then burn Bibles in the middle of the street. 
[00:51:30]  That's cool, right?  You ever use a Bible paper to roll a duper, man?  No.  It's the perfect thing.  What's the best page?  No, you always use the back page, like, because it's blank or has a map on it or something.  A map with something.  So it's not like you're, you know, dissing God or anything.  Right, you're not desecrating a Bible.  It's just the page with the credits.  Yeah.  You guys are knocking me.  You don't want to, like, smoke it on a picture of Jesus from a picture Bible, either. 
[00:52:00]  Hey, Jesus has a website, you know.  Swear to you.  There's some guy out there that says he looks just like Jesus.  He dresses like Jesus.  He's got Jesus.com.  And what he does, he gets chicks to bathe with him.  It says, like, a bathe with the Messiah thing.  And he gets naked with these girls in a bathtub.  Imagine you could turn water into wine, dude.  You'd be the hit of the party, man.  That'd be the greatest.  Jesus rules.  I do need a beer on that. 
[00:52:30]  Don't worry, man.  I'll just turn some water into wine.  It'll be crazy.  Hey, I have a feeling you guys are going to be stars on our radio show, man.  Yeah.  Yesterday morning, we woke up, like, all drunk and, like, no, we didn't go to sleep.  It was, like, 7 in the morning.  Yeah.  And we had nothing to do, so we went to church.  Yeah.  Because it's, like, a big sing-along and we get some free food and stuff.  It was crazy.  It's a big sing-along.  Yeah.  It's fun, right?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah, sure. 
[00:53:00]  Hey, where's that pot zone?  We've got to play it.  Oh, no, wait.  The, uh...  Should I smoke some more pot for this, man?  Yeah.  Hold on.  Oh, no, wait.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Let's hold the phone.  Hold on.  You guys got, uh...  Where am I?  You sound like them now.  No, I know.  Hold on.  Keith wants in.  Keith.  Hey, Keith.  Yo, what's up?  You're stoned, too?  Yeah, buddy.  Nice, dude.  What's going on?  New York stoner meets Virginia stoner.  See, we could all get along.  Yo, my pot's better, man.  Hey, dude. 
[00:53:30]  The drill we get over here is amazing.  You've got to get some.  Like, there's little orange hairs and all sorts of crazy stuff going on over here.  Dude, the conversation is just ridiculous.  It's like crazy.  It's the Harry Potter.  Oh, my God.  Harry Potter.  No.  Keith, call back on a better phone.  You're breaking up on us here.

Yeah, that one.  Yeah, we're going to play some.  You guys have heard the Afro Man, right?  Who?  Afro Man.  Who's that?  Oh, it's a great pot song.  Oh.  It's being played everywhere, my friend.  Well, why don't you play it then?  It's from Jane's Silent Bob Strike Back.  Yeah.  Yeah, I want to see that movie.  It looks pretty sweet, dude. 
[00:54:30]  The gays hate it, so it's got to be good.  Frigging gays, man.  You're not too sympathetic to the gay community?  If you like man-ass, stop complaining.  I mean...  What's worse than stinky man-ass?  Don't complain about anything at that point.  As a man, you know, yeah, I think that's, you know, stinky man-ass is kind of a bad thing.  Right. 
[00:55:00]  But, you know, if they're into it, what the hell?  Yeah, you know, go ahead, man.  Who cares, you know?  A man-ass is like their bong.  It's like, you know, I'd be doing it if I needed crack or something.  Like, I'm just one...  Dude, man.  Holy ass.  If it wasn't for the change in the couch, you might be out there.  We're going to send you a care package.  We're going to get you guys some better beer.  Oh, sweet, dude.  Hey, a couple lifeguards want to check in.

And they're flying a plane over the stadium for us today.  Yeah, I heard about that.  The O.B. and Anthony on BCN 3-7.  Over the tweeter center, Anthony. 
[01:00:00]  Thank you, thank you, thank you.  Basically saying that we're back in Boston on WBCN.  Let's see what's going on in Boston today.  Mike, what's up?  Not much.  How about you?  We're rocking, man.  Did I?  Yeah.  I'm driving on 93 right now.  And I had a wall sticker on my driver's side thing.  And I'm bringing two girls.  One girl just, like, lifted her shirt up. 
[01:00:30]  We were like, oh, my God.  You got wowed right off the bat.  See, it works.  You put a wow in your vehicle and girls see it.  And if they feel like it, they'll wow you.  Yeah, it was pretty cool.  Especially on a nice hot day.  Yeah.  We're hoping some ladies come down to the studio today.  Thanks, Mike.  Yeah, why aren't we getting wowed?  You know, just because we're stuck in this studio, some mean ladies can't come down here  and maybe give us a wowing.  We had a nice one last Wednesday.  Yes, we did.  The fine Becky, 18 years old.  Yeah. 
[01:01:00]  She wowed us.  It's on, well, go to opieandanthony.com.  And then you go to foundrymusic.com and you'll see Becky's luscious, luscious boobs.  If you're around Midtown, got a cell phone with you, or maybe you're at work, ready to get off  of work soon, come on down.  So, wow the crew.  All right, what do we got on the Olsen twins?  Oh, my God.  This news just coming in. 
[01:01:30]  The Olsen twins making a movie.  That doesn't sound very big, does it?  Who cares?  They've put a lot of these movies out that show them as the little prepubescent little  little kids roaming around, doing little mystery things.  Very kid-like.  Opie, finally, the dramatic debut of the Olsen twins.  15 years old now.  They've gotten their collective boobies together. 
[01:02:00]  And they want to do something more serious, is what it says.  After a night of brainstorming and pillow fights with friends.  This is what it says.  This comes from newsrec.com.  This is breaking news.  Yeah.  Okay.  They decided on a topic that's been in the news lately.  There's been lots of stuff lately about Jenna Bush, the president's daughter.  The press has been saying she's drinking beer, smoking butts, but she's just a girl like  me and Ashley.  I'm reading here, Opie.  I'm not saying she's just a girl like me, Anthony, and Ashley. 
[01:02:30]  I understand.  That would be Mary Kate and Ashley.  And maybe she has a lot of pressure and stuff because her dad is the president, says Mary  Kate, the genius out of the two, who will portray the reportedly out-of-control Jenna  Bush.  Now, I said Mary Kate was the press, and Ashley was the goer.  Yeah, that's what you said in Time Magazine.  Well, wouldn't you?  Yes.  My big quote in Time Magazine is that the Olsen twins are getting very hot.  Mary Kate's the press. 
[01:03:00]  Ashley's the goer.  Is the goer.  Now, they're casting Mary Kate as the out-of-control Jenna Bush, and Ashley is going to be her  sister.  It's going to be called Pardon Me, Daddy.  Sounds like a great title for a porno movie, too, doesn't it?  Pardon Me, Daddy.  They've been filming for three weeks, and it's almost done, said Ashley, who will share screen  time with her twin as Jenna's sister, Barbara.  The focus will be on Jenna from her point of view and what it's like to be in college when 
[01:03:30]  your dad is the president and stuff.  Yeah, we could all relate to that.  And stuff.  And stuff.  Yeah.  I remember.  Oh, here's the hottest thing.  Guys, guys, pull your junk out right now.  I'll give you a little time before you picture this in your head.  Get some lube, whatever you want to use, to crank out a batch.  I remember one day when Mary Kate was doing a real important scene when she's feeling really  overwhelmed, and she's crying and drinking a beer in the shower because she's so stressed  out. 
[01:04:00]  Thank you.  Hot.  There's no dialogue.  There's no dialogue.  It was so powerful.  I cried.  This is Ashley talking.  I just wanted to get in the shower with her and hug her like we do at home sometimes.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Good night.  Thank you.  Don't just stare at it.  Eat it.  Yes.  Man.  Mary Kate and Ashley go in the shower and hug?  Wait, Scott has a...  Where the hell's that coming from?  Scott has a slight problem here. 
[01:04:30]  Scott, what's the matter?  Yo, what's up, man?  What's the deal, man?  You know, you'll have this information out.  I've been listening for hours.  Yeah.  You hear about this big old information here.  Yeah.  I thought they were going to make a porno flick or something, man.  Dude, this is a prelude to porno.  Come on.  Did you just hear Anthony?  She sometimes gets in the shower with her sister.  Yeah, I'm kidding, man.  This is like going to shower and all.  You don't go from, you know, Mary Kate and Ashley in Paris with their mystery movie or  Our Lips Are Sealed, which does sound like a porno movie. 
[01:05:00]  You don't go from that into smut.  They're 15 already.  They're doing shower scenes.  15, they're doing shower scenes, Opie.  Did you hear me?  15, they're doing shower scenes.  Yes, I did.  And they hug in the shower at home.  Did I mention that?  Yeah, she did.  They're hugging.  Mary Kate and Ashley hugging.  Got it.  The shower at home?  I'm assuming they would be naked if a shower's involved, right?  Where's the internet camera there? 
[01:05:30]  Drinking a beer.  We have a new Olsen twins song.  We love playing the new Olsen twins songs.  Yes.  Because we truly believe deep down they're very dirty girls.  Pardon Me, Daddy is scheduled to air sometime in September.  And Bob Saget is, I guess, producing it.  Oh, he's the director.  There's a brief scene as President George Bush.  That's not the Bush I want to see in this movie.  And Bea Arthur is going to be Grandma Bush.  Grandma Bush.  Bea Arthur.  Who cares? 
[01:06:00]  Olsen twins in the shower.  Enough.  All right.  Come on.  What's that, Rick?  My favorite scene is Ashley, who plays my sister, Barbara.  Uh-huh.  Barbara.  She comes to visit me in college, and we're at a frat party.  After about eight beers each, we're sitting outside alone talking about how hard life is  and how much we love each other and that we would do anything for each other.  Anything?  Even though we were acting, it was great because we're sisters in real life, and it was like 
[01:06:30]  really true and stuff.  Having a twin sister is really fun.  Like really true and stuff.  And junk.  Yeah, and having a twin sister is really fun.  Pardon Me, Daddy.  Who's not looking forward to pardon me, Daddy?  And Bob Saget.  Don't become Bob Faget and leave that on the cutting room floor.  And put out a video of the stuff you did cut out.  Olsen twins.  Less than three years away from a legitimate threesome. 
[01:07:00]  Legal with the Olsen twins.  Depends what state you're in, my friend.  It could be as soon as what?  Next year.  Could be.  You want to hear the latest Olsen twins song?  Yeah, which one is this?  They love talking about sex.  Oh, really?  And singing about sex.  Yeah.  Check this out.  A little piece.  B-U-T-T out.  B-U-T-T out.  Turn your tiny frame about.  And B-U-T-T out.  B-U-T-T out.  B-U-T-T out. 
[01:07:30]  You better not cry.  You better not bow.  You better just turn your butt about.  And B-U-T-T out.  Wow.  That's an anal song.  Yeah.  You like that, don't you, bitch?  Do we have some audio from the movie?  Really?  Hey, Anthony.  Yeah.  Hold on.  Phil, watch it.  Hey, could you say that story again a little slower and like a little girly voice now?  Yeah.  Yeah, that's nice.  We ought to just go on the street and get some kid to tell us that story. 
[01:08:00]  Yeah, there you go.  Oh, shut up.  Rachel's here.  Yeah?  Have her tell the story.  Get Rachel in here.  Where is she?  Let's see if it sounds hotter with Rachel reading the scene.  Yeah.  Hey, could you say that story again a little better?  Why is everyone putting their radio on?  People love turning the radio on.  I'll have to hang up on you because it messes us up so they can hear it.  Our very hot intern, Rachel.  Oh, we have some sound effects from one of the frat parties in the movie? 
[01:08:30]  Yeah.  Do you want me to read the whole quote or what did you want me to say?  Oh, right from I Remember One Day.  Right there.  You see that?  You've got to sound like a little younger.  Like Mary-Kate and Ashley.  A little younger.  Hey, thanks.  Hold on.  Let me get ready.  Okay.  All right.  This is one of the scenes from a movie they're filming.  Go ahead.  Rachel.  I remember one day when Mary-Kate was doing a really important scene when she was feeling  really overwhelmed and she's crying and drinking a beer in the shower because she's so stressed out. 
[01:09:00]  There's no dialogue.  It was so powerful.  I cried.  I just wanted to get in the shower with her and hug her like we do at home sometimes.  Like we do at home sometimes.  Like we do at home.  Oh, my God.  How about that?  Nice.  Thank you.  Oh, yeah.  The other scene?  Okay, sure.  Who knew that was going on in the Olsen household? 
[01:09:30]  And we were at a frat party.  After about eight beers each, we were sitting outside alone talking about how hard life is  and how much we love each other and that we would do anything for each other.  Even though we were acting, it was great because we're sisters in real life.  And it was like really true and stuff.  Having a twin sister is really fun.  She was a whore.  Can we play Brother Joe songs? 
[01:10:00]  Yeah, where are those?  They're good.  Anthony's brother, Joe.  A couple of ditties.  One about the Bush twins and one about the Olsen twins.  Yeah, how about that?  Both done to the same exact song.  The Patty Duke theme.  The Patty Duke theme from the old Patty Duke show.  All right, they're setting that up.  Let's check in with Philly and Tony.  Tony, what's up?  Hey, Opie Anthony.  What's up, man?  What's up, dude?  Yo, I'm just sitting here driving through Philly.  Yeah.  Mary Kate in the shower drinking a beer.  I just emptied my chunky beef gravy bag all over my seat. 
[01:10:30]  Oh, my God.  I sure hope you didn't.  Tony, you starting to see some wild things out there or what?  Well, I took a bar of soap today and wrote it on the back of my window because I can't  get a sticker from nobody, but we'll get some out there.  Nothing going on yet.  Yeah, it takes time, but the homemade wow signs, they work just as well.  Oh, it's great, man.  You guys are awesome.  Thank you, Tony.  Thanks, man.  Greatest thing I ever heard on the radio.  Greatest.  Yeah, we're having fun.  Give it some time.  Thanks, Tony.  All right.  Take care of yourself, guys.  All right.  Yeah, it is Whip Em Out Wednesday. 
[01:11:00]  We're hearing from a lot of the ladies out there.  B-U-T-T out.  What?  Sorry, what?  They're helping us out with the cause today, Ant.  Yes.  If you want in on this, all you have to do is get a homemade wow sign on your car or get  the wow bumper sticker, whatever.  And if the ladies feel like it, they will flash you, okay?  Mm-hmm.  B-U-T-T out.  B-U-T-T out.  Turn your tiny frame about and B-U-T-T out.  B-U-T-T out.  B-U-T-T out. 
[01:11:30]  You better not cry.  You better not pout.  You better just turn your butt up out and B-U-T-T out.  Nice, right?  We're stalling because we're trying to get the songs, but...  Yeah, that's right.  Oh, where are they?  Okay, which one is which?  That's the American Ashley.  Okay.  This is the Olsen twins song, Anthony, by Brother Joe.  Here's Mary Beach.  She likes Disney flicks and Barbie dolls and Pogo sticks. 
[01:12:00]  But Ashley is a little slut.  She likes her loving the...  Loves their porno flicks.  They're the Olsen.  Adolescent vixens all the way.  They will give up their high men's for some lucky guy one day.  While Mary-Kate likes to play knock-knock and hide and seek and sing a lot.  Well, Ashley is the one that goes so glad they take off all the clothes for the money shot. 
[01:12:30]  They're the Olsen's, identical vixens, and you'll find.  They laugh alike.  They laugh alike.  I bet they'll even f*** alike.  And you know they'll be tight.  The Olsen's, take them from the eyes.  There you have it, Brother Joe's song.  My God.  A lot of reports coming in that Rick has handed us a fake news story from newsrec.com. 
[01:13:00]  Rick goes, that was fake?  I know.  Duh!  Of course it is.  Newsrec's like The Onion.  You know what The Onion is?  Yeah.  It's like a fake news story.  It's funny.  But, you know, don't look for the Olsen twins in that movie.  Well, that means they don't shower together either, Anthony.  Well, no, they do that.  Stop.  Don't ever say they don't shower at home.  Well, the whole story is fake. 
[01:13:30]  Come on.  It was a thrill for a couple of minutes.  Rick was great.  It's fake?  Well, like we're a serious man.  First of all, Rick, like they're going to change the image that has netted them billions.  These chicks are loaded.  Billions of dollars doing these little movies.  And they're going to start swigging beer and showering together.  Hey, you guys are like, yeah, we've got to get this on.  Well, of course we did.  Come on.  You ran in here so excited about the news story. 
[01:14:00]  Yeah, it was hot.  When you read that quote, of course you run in.  Just ask Boston.  We don't like doing fake news.  That's right.  Fake news doesn't work on the radio.  Not even birds or anything?  No, no, no.  Well, we could all dream.  And you know something?  They're going to outgrow that phase where they're doing those little movies they're doing now.  And they might have to start doing some fun stuff that we can watch.  All right.  James, what's going on?  James.  Hey, guys.  Yeah, what's up, buddy?  Hey, yeah.  Dude, man. 
[01:14:30]  I'm out here in D.C.  First time listening to you guys.  Yeah.  I love this whole wow thing, dude.  I'm driving down 16th by Pennsylvania Avenue.  Yeah.  I just got flashed twice.  Come on, man.  Bro, I like this.  This is fun.  Well, thank you, James.  So where can I get one of those stickers right now?  I just wrote it down on the back of my window.  Well, the homemade wow signs are really cool because we like the grassroots thing.  Well, see, the thing about it is that I sell cars, so I'm driving a demo car.  Yeah.  So you know that those markers that you put, like the price on the cars and stuff? 
[01:15:00]  Yeah.  That's what I use.  So I just wrote a really big wow on the back of the window.  Right on, James.  Well, thanks for helping us out with the show, all right?  No problem, man.  It's only been three days in Washington, but basically, yeah, you write wow on the back of  your car or make a homemade wow sign and drive around and kind of forget about it, and if  the ladies feel like it, they'll flash you.  Yeah.  Well, it works.  I have to bring up something else real fast, Ant.  What?  Did you get what you were searching for from your computer? 
[01:15:30]  Well, you know, I never understand why this is such a big issue.  I recently got a new computer.  Oh, I got to get everyone in here to back me up on this.  Rachel and Andy and John.  Everyone was in the office, I know.  It's not like I was hiding anything I was doing.  I think this is standard operating procedure.  You guys got to understand, we're in an office.  There's five of us from the show and then interns and everyone else.  It's a small space and we're crowded in there.  And from time to time, you know, I'm looking for stuff to throw away because there's a lot 
[01:16:00]  of clutter and lots and lots of cases of beer that.  Yeah.  But that is kind of getting a little ahead.  And so I look at this computer, Anthony's old computer's on the floor and it's been there  for what, two or three months now?  I got a new one for the house.  So I took the one from the house, brought it here to the station and I took the one that  I used to have at the station, which is a piece of crap, and I just packed it up in  a box.  Right.  And the box has been sitting on the floor in our office.  So Hope goes, what are you going to do with this?  Anything?  I'm like, no.  He goes, well, why don't you toss it? 
[01:16:30]  I'm like, yeah, I'll make some room, you know, and toss it.  So I go, I'm going to just toss it.  And you're like, well, yeah, I'll toss it.  Yeah.  Oh, no, I didn't sound that suspicious.  I don't know.  Wait a minute.  It was a little weird, though, because I was ready to take it away right then.  Toss it what, now?  Right.  I was ready to take it away.  And then, I don't know, we either went for lunch or a little time went by.  You guys went to get coffee, right?  Oh, we went for coffee, and I come back. 
[01:17:00]  You had the whole thing taken apart.  All right.  It's standard operating procedure for disposing of a computer.  Well, while you guys went to get coffee, I'm sitting there working on something, and  Anthony's looking around.  He's like, I need something sharp.  What about these scissors?  He's trying to find them to pry it open.  I needed a screwdriver, not to pry it open.  Oh, my God.  I get him Earl's, what do you call it, knife.  Yeah.  Earl has a, you know, switchblade.  His utility knife.  I don't know what he uses it for.  Swiss army knife.  That would entail work. 
[01:17:30]  I give it to Ant.  Next thing I know, he's got this thing in his hand, and I'm just looking at him like,  hey, he's working on something, whatever.  But you're the one that noticed, like, hey.  No, that was, what was that from the computer?  It was my hard drive.  It was my hard drive.  When you throw away a computer, you remove, I removed the hard drive.  I removed the processor.  I took out the RAM.  I took out the sound card and the video card.  Right.  It's, it's, I used that stuff.  You couldn't get into the hard drive case to remove the evidence. 
[01:18:00]  Well, I, I.  And then you're explaining to me the proper way to destroy a hard drive.  I'm like, where do you read this stuff?  I get, I get a lot of PC magazines.  It's like, you know what you got to do?  You got to get a drill, and you got to.  You drill holes in the hard drive.  But the, but the holes have to be a, what'd you say?  Like, an eighth of an inch of heart.  An eighth of an inch of heart.  And then it's unrecoverable information on your hard drive.  But meanwhile, while he's doing, while you, while you're looking at him, he goes, well,  you know, there's just some pictures I want to save from here that I have.  Oh, no, there's nothing on that hard drive.  There really is nothing. 
[01:18:30]  There's just, what he really said, there he goes, well, I just want to see, you know,  what's inside the hard drive case.  That's all.  Yeah, I do want to take one apart.  I know me, and this, this is the way I've always been.  I take everything apart because I like seeing how it works.  It was just.  But as far as the hard drive goes, yeah, I was removing it because you don't put a computer  on the street with your old hard drive in there because you don't know what information  is on there.  I have credit card things that I would, I would order stuff for on the internet and  you put your credit card stuff in there. 
[01:19:00]  There's cookies that have your info on there.  You don't leave your hard drive in a computer that you throw away.  It's okay.  It was just really funny.  Because I'm like, no, coming on the heels of the Mary Kate and Ashley break, this is  a little incriminating.  But I'm like, I'll just take your computer away.  I'm cleaning up the office today a little bit.  No, no, no, no, no.  And the next thing I know, you got your hard drive case in your head.  But like I said, also, I take the processor, all the RAM out and the cards, you know, and  I save that stuff for any future computer use. 
[01:19:30]  It was funny.  The hard drive will be destroyed because I just transferred everything over that I needed.  Yeah.  But like I said, I don't know what other kind of information is on there.  But then explaining the drill thing, an eighth of an inch apart.  No, that's what I heard.  Oh, what a, I read it in the magazines.  I read a lot of computer magazines.  Like, what a nightmare.  Ah, just find the child porn.  Who cares?  Gary Glitter's out of jail already.  Why didn't you just format the hard drive, dumbass?  Sometimes that don't work.  Jeff, what's up?  Hey, Jeff.  Yeah. 
[01:20:00]  What's going on?  Yeah, I just want to let you all know that you got all the police officers here in Northern  Virginia dying.  Dying?  They're killing us with this.  Is that the best show I've ever heard?  Oh, you like this?  Oh, definitely.  Jesus Christ.  What are we doing?  It's still early.  We haven't even really figured out what we're doing yet.  Yeah.  Hey, Jeff.  Yeah.  You know what?  Talk to some of the NYPD guys.  Oh, really?  Because they've been listening to this show for three years, and it's a rip, and I would  really like to speed through Virginia and not get a ticket, too.  I'm sure you get a pass through here.  Right on, man.  Hey, thank you.  Thank you, Jeff. 
[01:20:30]  Say hi.  All right.  All right.  Have a good one.  Yes, Ben?  You've done it, Terrell.  Once again, he's called in and said, tell Anthony to go F himself.  Go F yourself.  He's got like the little utility Swiss Army blade.  He called out.  He didn't want to go on the air, but he goes, tell Anthony to go F himself.  I work.  Look, he's got his utility blade.  It's got tools on it like you would have on a tool belt.  The Phillips head, the regular, all the pliers.  There are pliers in this thing.  I'm like, what is Earl doing that he even needs anything like this?  I'm filling out the public file.  We still don't know what Earl does here. 
[01:21:00]  Too funny.  All right.  We have to take a break.  Paul Mercurio is going to join the party.  Also, a lady.  Oh, is that at five o'clock?  Yeah, five o'clock.  Yeah, we found this lady that gives sex tips to guys, but see, she's a lesbian, so she  kind of knows a female's body.  What the female like?  Okay.  We'll go with it.  We'll see what it's about.  It could either be cool or we'll just, you know, whatever.  She sounded hot on the phone.  Yeah.  You know the deal.  Can we play that Ted Knight thing as we go to break? 
[01:21:30]  I got mine.  You get yours.  Oh!  If you're not in New York and you're trying to get a hold of the show, 866-277-4WOW.  A lot of WOW sightings in many different states, Anthony.  This is very, very cool.  It is Whip'em Out Wednesday.  It's very easy to get involved.  Just write WOW in the back of your car.  Homemade signs, duct tape, whatever.  And if the ladies feel like it, they will flash on the way home.  In the newer cities, it takes time because we've got to, like, educate the ladies.  Right. 
[01:22:00]  But do not harass the ladies.  Don't follow them.  None of that crap, all right?  Because there are plenty of ladies that will just do it because they feel like it.  Something great.  We had Frank Caliendo in the studio recently.  And we like to call this thing Dueling Ted Knights.  I Ted Knighted it.  We're the naked cowboy.  Oh, no.  Spalding.  I want you with a golf course in five minutes.  Chop, chop.  Come on.  Come on in. 
[01:22:30]  We've got to go back and forth.  Did you hear the one about the colored boy?  No.  Go ahead.  No, I heard that one.  That's a hoot.  Wait a second.  You be Ted Knight.  Wait.  Wait.  I almost said the wrong word.  You screwed up.  I screwed up.  Who screwed up?  I did.  Okay.  You be Ted Baxter.  I'll be the guy from Too Close for Comfort.  It's easy to grin when your ship comes in and you've got the stock market beat, but the man 
[01:23:00]  that's worthwhile is the man that could smile when his shorts are too tight in the seat.  Okay.  Okay.  Pookie.  Chris in the boat.  Wait a second.  I think Monroe wants to see the cowboy.  Monroe.  Naked cowboy.  Here.  Now.  Lou.  Lou.  Lou.  Mary.  Mary.  Mary.  Thanks, Mary.  Lou.  I love that thing.  Black Earl is in the studio.  Earl.  Earl.  Earl.  Watch it.  He has a knife.  Earl, what's wrong? 
[01:23:30]  I appreciated that you gave me the tool to use.  Not the tool.  You gave me a knife with tools in it.  It's a knife with tools in it.  To help me to recover some property from my computer.  To help.  I was just saying, what the hell does Earl need that for?  For emergencies like this, to bury evidence, to do stuff?  Bury evidence.  Bury evidence.  Were you insulted that yesterday when you wore shorts, Ben said you had legs like an Ethiopian?  Were you upset by that? 
[01:24:00]  Because I would have been.  A little bit, yes.  Earl, you've got some skinny legs.  What?  It's all right.  It's all right.  I'm not a big, fat slob.  Ben, what's the problem?  Classic Earl last night.  We were at the Radiohead show.  Earl turns to me and goes, this is the best concert I've ever seen.  And then leaves.  I mean, no, don't lie.  Where are you going, Earl?  It was the last song.  It was, God damn it.  It was five minutes before.  It was 10.55. 
[01:24:30]  They were performing the last song.  Yeah.  I got up.  I said, I've got to catch a train.  And I went, I stood at the edge of the walkway.  And watched the last song, because I had to catch a train.  All right.  And that's construed as leaving.  You sold me.  Blow me.  Oh, hey.  Earl.  Oh, my God.  You can't say that.  What?  You sold me, Earl.  I now totally believe what you said.  And why would you want Ben to do that to you? 
[01:25:00]  Displaying the rage.  Earl, the fine folks at Metropolitan aren't going to be happy that you're walking out of  the Radiohead show.  Look out of the Radiohead show.  We got all you guys some great seats for the concert last night.  I did not walk out of the show.  Ben, did he leave early?  He left early.  I stood at the aisle.  You stone-cold liar.  Oh, wow.  A stone-cold liar.  What is a stone-cold liar?  Is that worse than just being a liar?  I'm lying, and that's the bottom line. 
[01:25:30]  It was 10.55.  Earl, I believe you, man.  So you saw the last song in the, what?  I saw it standing up.  I was in the aisleway.  I can tell you what the song was.  It was exit music for a film.  All right.  Okay, Earl.  Thank you.  All right.  You're going to be part of the WOW Summit next week when we go to Philly?  I have no idea.  We don't have a van right now.  We're sending Harley.  What happened to the van?  We're sending everything.  We're sending girls on Harleys down there. 
[01:26:00]  We don't have a van right now.  The van doesn't work?  No.  It's being repaired.  Again.  Wow, okay.  No, we're doing the WOW Summit to Philly.  Yeah, we're sending a bunch of people on bikes.  Motorcycles, Earl.  With some topless girls.  That would be cool.  We have the van.  I'll go.  They're going to go from New York to Philly.  It's like we're sending out a probe to see how Philly is dealing with us so far.  Yeah.  A little gift from New York to Philly. 
[01:26:30]  They better enjoy this one.  Assuming we have a van, yeah, I'll go.  All right.  Hey, Earl, weren't we supposed to do a sticker stop today?  Yes.  But the van.  The van blew up!  Yeah.  The death trap.  The death trap blew up.  Couldn't you have carjacked something and done the sticker stop that way?  Or hot wire.  No?  Looks like you got the tools for it.  Yeah, you got that multi-tool.  All right, Earl.  Thank you.  Ben, anything else about Earl?  No.  All right, Earl.  Doing a great job.  Whatever it is.  Okay.  Oh, God.  Public file? 
[01:27:00]  How's the public file?  What are you doing today, Earl?  Yeah, give us your little itinerary for today.  What did you do?  MTV.  Trying to get tickets for the MTV Video Music Awards.  We're trying to put together a trip to New Orleans.  Uh-huh.  Uh-huh.  Uh-huh.  Uh-huh.  How was that?  And that's it.  That's it.  We're in the throat.  I'm not finished.  Anything else?  I'm just going to play my throat.  Are you feeling a little sick today?  No.  Anything else?  I get a little upset. 
[01:27:30]  I get all worked out.  He has nothing else.  Anything else?  Let me finish.  Trip to Seattle.  All right.  First of all, we're not going to get a trip to Seattle.  We're not going to get a trip to New Orleans.  And we're not going to get anything with the Video Music Awards.  Finish who?  So what else are you doing?  Fine.  Anything else station-related?  Public file?  Trying to get the van back.  Guys, I'm working on getting Jesus Christ himself on your show.  Would you be interested?  I already got it.  Yeah, yeah.  All right.  I love that one. 
[01:28:00]  Hey, if John Lennon's available, can I wheel him by?  Guys, the president's going to be in town.  Would you be interested?  Would you be interested in interviewing him?  I got a connection at the White House.  Sure, yeah.  We'd be interested.  And then you don't hear anything.  Do you guys want to give away a trip for two to Camp David?  I've got tickets.  I'm working on a trip on the Space Shuttle to see Donna Summer.  All right.  On the Space Shuttle.  Oh, let's play Donna Summer as we go to break.  That's fine.  All right.  Donna Summer.  On the Space Shuttle. 
[01:28:30]  On the Space Shuttle.  Got all about this damn thing.  No, Earl, you're doing a great job.  Earl, you must be doing a bang-up job.  You've been here longer than anyone else.  Here, uh...  Not longer than Pete.  Well, you've been here, um...  Second longest.  All right.  As we go to break, some stupid lady calling the wrong radio station trying to win Donna Summer tickets.  Mm-hmm.  Hi, Annie W.  Am I the right caller?  What were you calling for?  Um, Donna Summer tickets.  Oh.  Donna Summer tickets. 
[01:29:00]  Are you a big Donna Summer's fan?  Yes, but I'm more of a f***ing 0.5 fan.  Oh, boy.  Here we go.  She knows the right things to say.  Here we go.  Let me tell you something.  Mm-hmm.  You're going to see Donna Summer.  You're kidding.  Congratulations.  Thank you.  Matter of fact, we're going to put you in the front row.  Absolutely.  For Donna Summer.  What do you say?  I don't believe it.  Thank you very much.  Congratulations.  Thank you.  Hey, what color panties are you wearing? 
[01:29:30]  I'm wearing a bathing suit.  Donna Summer wants to know.  What kind of bathing suit are you wearing?  A one-piece?  A thong?  Bikini?  A bikini.  I'm sun tanning.  Sun tanning.  And I'm by my pool with my radio with f***ing 0.5 on.  Oh, boy.  She says it again.  Look at that.  Since she's mentioned the station so many times, I think another prize is in order.  You like the disco era?  Yes, I do.  The whole disco dancing thing?  Absolutely.  How about a disco weekend in Las Vegas, Nevada? 
[01:30:00]  That's right.  You'll be whisked away to Las Vegas, Nevada to see Donna Summer in Las Vegas.  Are you serious?  We are serious.  I can't believe this.  You just have to tell us one thing.  What?  What's the strangest object you've ever used during sex?  The what?  Donna wants to know.  Nothing.  You're a virgin.  No.  You're a big, fat virgin.  Yay!  Good job, the bad virgin. 
[01:30:30]  And what's your favorite station?  0.5.  She said it again.  You know what you're going to win now?  What?  A trip on the space shuttle.  Yay!  The first person in space.  You're going to see Donna Summer on the space shuttle.  Isn't this fantastic?  Oh, this is wonderful.  Have you ever been on the space shuttle?  No, I haven't.  Have you?  Oh, it's beautiful.  Yes.  Fantastic.  It's going to have a big disco ball.  Mm-hmm.  They're going to decorate it all? 
[01:31:00]  Hey, do you know how to dial a phone?  Yes.  What's your favorite sexual position?  Hello?  Donna wants to know.  Hello?  Oh, no.  Is she hanging out finally?  She's gone.  Oh, my God.  It took forever.  Okay.  Well, they have these big kids.  Whip, whip, whip, whip.  Whip, whip.  Whip, whip.  Whip, whip.  Whip, whip.  Whip, whip.  Whip.  Whip.  Whip.  Whip.  Whip.  Whip.  Whip.  Whip.  Whip.  Wednesday.  What's the fuck, yo?  Opie and A. 
[01:31:30]  Anthony Planet Java.  When was the last time you trembled?  Hmm?  You ever trembled?  During Sex for Sam.  There you go.  Lots and lots of caffeine.  Planet Java.  It's put out by the Coca-Cola people.  How about Tremble?  The drink everyone's been talking about from Planet Java.  It's the highest caffeinated drink in the country.  It's 121 milligrams of caffeine in there.  It's bam in a bottle.  Is it legal?  Yes.  It's legal.  And it'll get you shaken. 
[01:32:00]  Like Jay Moore says, like a car on bad gas.  They got Karamocha, chocolate, caramel, and a coffee.  And Java Delic.  A smooth grown-up milkshake.  And all these things make great mixers.  If the stoner guys are listening.  Planet Java iced coffee available wherever Coca-Cola products are sold.  If your retailer doesn't have Planet Java yet, tell them, hey, get some Planet Java tool.  Iced coffee just got cool.  Settle for nothing less.  We love it here.  And when we need a great pick-me-up, we use Tremble.  Settle for nothing less. 
[01:32:30]  Planet Java.  Hour, hour, hour, hour.  By Opie and Anthony.  All owned by Infinity Broadcasting.  This is 1027 WNEW.  New York.  Whoa.  Dramatic pause.  We're going to have to get the stoners back on the phone in just a bit here.  It's the Opie and Anthony show.  In the studio, Paul Mercurio.  Hey, guys.  From the Daily Show, of course, on Comedy Central. 
[01:33:00]  If you're not in New York and you want to get a hold of us, 866-277-4WOW.  Paul, you've got to bear with me.  I've got to give someone some really bad news right now.  Yeah, no problem.  I think they're on the phone here.  You can help me out if you like.  All right.  Did you hear about Maureen Reagan?  No.  I mean, I don't know.  Ronald Reagan's daughter?  Yeah.  What about her?  She passed away today.  Really?  And I do believe someone has no clue.  Hello?  Hello?  Hello?  President Reagan. 
[01:33:30]  Hello?  President Reagan.  Where?  No, sir.  That's you.  Yes?  Yeah.  I'm who?  You're the former president of the United States of America.  Yes.  Oh, yes.  Hello, my fellow Americans.  Let me tell you.  Libyan madman Muammar Gaddafi cannot continue.  His reign of terror.  Sir?  Yes.  He's not really a threat anymore.  Who?  Gaddafi. 
[01:34:00]  Who?  Gaddafi.  Yes.  As I was saying.  He's not a threat anymore.  The Ayatollah Khomeini.  You let those hostages go.  I think he's dead.  Yes, sir.  Because we'll.  Sir, he's dead.  I won't.  Who?  Ronald Reagan?  No, no.  He died.  He was a fine American president.  No, no, no.  He will be missed by me.  No, no, sir.  That's you.  Who am I?  You're alive.  Yes.  You're the president.  The former president.  I am.  Getting me confused now.  How come I don't get to fly in the big plane anymore? 
[01:34:30]  Close your eyes.  Mommy.  Mommy, get me an ice cream cone.  Hello?  Yeah.  Why are you calling?  It's your old friends, Opie and Anthony.  You remember us, right?  We call you from time to time.  Amos and Andy was a fine show.  No, Opie and Anthony.  A nice colored man.  And we have Paul Mercurio in the studio.  I use Mercurochrome when I cut myself.  Oh, sir.  No.  To find a thing that fights in contusions.  No.  No, no.  Hello.  Sir.  Yes.  Are you sitting down? 
[01:35:00]  Freddie Mercury was a great singer.  Freddie Mercury?  And you listen to Freddie Mercury.  Is he in the studio?  No, no.  That's Paul Mercurio.  Mercurio.  Yes.  Yes.  I'm sorry to hear about your age.  No.  Hello.  Paul does not have age, sir.  I don't.  That's nice.  No.  Paul is the walrus.  Yes.  Are you sitting down, sir?  I don't know.  We have some sad news for you today.  Sad news.  Yes, your daughter passed away.  Oh, my God. 
[01:35:30]  Maureen Reagan?  Maureen McCormick.  No, no, no.  She was an inspiration playing that young woman, Marsha Brady.  What's your last name, sir?  And she will be missed.  She was quite a...  No, sir.  Yes.  Maureen Reagan, your daughter.  Maureen Reagan.  She passed away today of skin cancer at the age of 60.  Oh, my God.  You outlived your daughter, sir.  I remember once telling her, Maureen Reagan, tear down that wall.  No.  I didn't think you said that.  It finally happened. 
[01:36:00]  Well, years later, the Iron Curtain fell, and now we can all, yes, hello.  Sir, do you have photos of your family nearby?  Photos of my family.  Yeah.  The only member of my family I see is that big-headed monster Nancy.  She's right there.  Would someone please get her away?  She frightens me.  No, she's right there, and she's taking care of you, sir.  Look, I'm a pincushion, and my brain is flowers.  Hello?  Oh, yes, I'm a television set, and my mind goes boom, boom. 
[01:36:30]  Sir, we've got to try this again, sir.  You have to understand, your daughter.  Nancy looks like a Mardi Gras float.  No.  She's frightening.  I, well, sometimes I bend her head back and expect Pez to come out.  No, sir, that's...  That woman is, she frightens me.  No, she's a...  She's an Alzheimer's carrier, because when you look at her, my God, you want to forget the image.  Sir, she's a saint.  She's taking care of you. 
[01:37:00]  She looks like a Q-tip dipped in Mercuric...  No, it's me.  ...all Mercuricrome.  She's helping you out in the twilight of your life, sir.  Oh, you think so.  Yes, I do.  You try living with that freak show.  She looks like one of those big Garfield balloons they use in parades.  Just her head and the rest of her, my God.  You went to bed down with that white cauliflower ass every night.  You pray for Alzheimer's to take your memory away. 
[01:37:30]  Memories of, well, starlets in the 40s and 50s.  I was banging them while you were still banging cheerleaders.  It seems like you're remembering a lot, Mr. Reagan.  I fake the Alzheimer's.  It's a clever ruse to not have to talk to Nancy.  I'm sharp as a effing tag.  How do you feel about your daughter, Maureen? 
[01:38:00]  She was a twat.  No, she was a twat.  I don't care if she's dead.  Sir, she just died.  I wish all my kids would die right down to that little faggot son I got.  Well, he has a low T-cell count.  And he's got my name, Ron Reagan, Jr.  Yes, he does.  You know what I used to call Ron Reagan, Jr.?  What I used to put inside starlets.  Old Ron Reagan, Jr.  How were you more in the passing of your daughter, sir?  I could give a flying hit. 
[01:38:30]  I'm just going to celebrate when Nancy leaves.  She goes to pick up more Alzheimer's medication.  It's party time.  This is an explosion.  Oh, wait.  Here she comes.  Hold on.  Hold on, boys.  Hold on.  Okay.  Yes, Mommy.  Hello.  No.  I want to play on the sit and spin.  Look, Mommy.  I'm a whoopee cushion.  Yes, okay.  More ice cream, Mommy.  Thank you.  Tell her the can of soup is actually a telephone. 
[01:39:00]  She's gone.  When can that bitch die?  I fooled her great the other day.  The phone rang, and I answered the toaster.  You answered the toaster?  That's a hot one.  She went for that one, huh?  She starts crying.  Yeah.  Are you walking on water these days?  I'll do anything.  I don't care.  As long as she thinks I'm crazy.  Are you riding horses on the ranch?  No.  I talk to them in front of Nancy.  What a pisser.  And she leaves town. 
[01:39:30]  Yeah.  Well, I invite Gerald Ford over, and we talk about the good old days when, well, we used  to bang strippers.  Wonderful old times.  Before that came into my life.  Does he bring wife Betty over?  Teddy brings the chicks.  If he doesn't kill him, the stupid son of a bitch.  All right.  Listen, President Reagan, we're going to let you go, okay?  Okay.  And I knew about Maureen, and I could give a crap. 
[01:40:00]  Oh, my God.  Oh, wait, Nancy's coming.  Hold on.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Look, Mommy, I'm eating the phone.  All right, take it easy, boys.  All right, bye.  Bye-bye.  Bye, Mommy.  Yeah.  There he goes.  Wow.  That's an exclusive, Paul.  We talk to him a lot, and that's the first time he has admitted to us that he doesn't  really have the Alzheimer's.  And he sounds broken up about Maureen.  Yeah.  Um, where's Ant?  Where's Anthony?  Anthony, what are you doing?  What?  What are you doing?  What happened? 
[01:40:30]  I told you we were going to talk to President Reagan today.  Yeah, I had to go to the bathroom.  Again.  Did you have to go drill a thing, then chills into your hard drive?  Into my hard drive.  That's what I was doing.  You freak.  Why?  Was Reagan on the phone again?  Did I miss, uh, the President again?  Yeah, and he admitted that he doesn't have Alzheimer's.  That always happens.  Gee, Clark, why aren't you around when Superman's here?  That old gag.  Sean, what's up?  Dude, that was brutal.  What?  I love the Reagan bit, man.  I feel like I've got to go to confession now.  That was disgusting. 
[01:41:00]  She deserved it.  Stop whining.  Oh, no.  Stop whining.  All right.  Thank you.  Oh, good Lord, guys.  His daughter just died.  Pretty tasteless.  Mike from Jersey.  No, I know it was.  It was bad.  Oh, my God.  She was heavy.  That was Reagan.  Who knew he was, um, I was listening in the bathroom.  Who knew he was, uh...  He was okay.  He just put it on so he wouldn't have to talk to Nancy.  Who knew that?  Well, why don't we move on, Anthony?  Because people are hating us right now.  Liz.  Hey, guys. 
[01:41:30]  Hey.  Hi, Liz.  Um, I just wanted to apologize.  I can't come in on Friday.  Oh, no.  We're doing...  I can't, like, it's a real reason my sister's in the hospital, but, like...  What's wrong?  Does she have skin cancer?  Oh, no.  No, it's my sister, the hot blonde.  Yeah, she looks like me, but she's blonde.  We were going to do lesbian for a day on Friday.  I think we're still doing it, and you were going to join the fray, and there was going  to be, like, a threesome thing happening, right?  Yeah, I can't come, though.  So I just wanted to apologize.  I'm really upset about it.  You have to see her all day?  You can't come for, like, an hour?  Yeah, she...  I have to go to Philadelphia. 
[01:42:00]  I'm going to be there.  Should we reschedule you for another lesbian for a day?  Yeah, you can do that.  Are you going to help us with the WOW Summit next Wednesday?  Yeah, I sent Keith the cop an email.  He didn't get back to me, though.  All right.  All right.  What Keith has to do, he's got to tell us where he's going to start this WOW Summit on Wednesday.  We're going to send a whole crew down to Philadelphia.  Mm-hmm.  Just as kind of a little present from us to them.  Yeah.  So we need Keith to decide where he's going to leave from, so maybe other people could join  the caravan.  Oh, sure.  Yeah, I'd be more than happy to do that.  And they're going to be calling in during the show, and then we're going to meet somewhere 
[01:42:30]  in Philly.  We want all this worked out so everyone can enjoy this, you know?  Open to everyone.  All right, Liz, that's bad news, but we'll reschedule you for another...  Okay.  And when you guys are off the air, ask John about my horrible experience today.  Why off the air?  Why don't you tell us now?  Because you don't want to hear any negative things about WOWs on the air.  Oh, I see.  Some guy climbed in my car when I was stopped at a light, and I flashed him.  He climbed in my car with a condom and said, you showed me your T's, now I get to F you. 
[01:43:00]  Oh, that's always fun, huh?  There you go.  Yeah.  All right, you guys know, I'm a true WOWer.  I'll drive around Topless every Wednesday still for you.  I don't mind.  All right, Liz.  All right, love you guys.  Bye.  Love you.  All right, bye.  There she goes.  Love you.  Wow.  You said I love you, so I said I love you back.  That's what you do.  What?  Hey, Chuck, what's going on?  How are you guys doing?  Pretty good.  I ordered a CD you guys have off on Foundry, Opie and Anthony Demental World.  Yeah.  After that, I'm glad I'm ordering this CD. 
[01:43:30]  Is there any other ones like that?  Are you making more like that?  Yeah, we're working on another one for the fall called Cringe.  Oh, okay.  But, yeah, Demental World, it's still out there.  They decided to stop paying us like two years ago.  Yeah, I basically came across the back to the Foundry, and I'm glad I did.  Especially after hearing Ronald on the phone.  All right, cool.  Thanks, Chuck.  Thanks, guys.  Paul's laughing.  Yeah.  Ron was very entertaining to them.  We said some bad things about our record company because we weren't getting any checks  anymore.  Oh.  So then the official word came that now that we're talking bad about the record company,  we're not going to pay you anymore. 
[01:44:00]  We were talking badly about them because they weren't paying us.  So we got on the air, we started bashing them, and they go, well, now that you're talking  bad about us, now we're not going to pay you.  Wait, but you weren't.  No, no, Aaron, we were going to pay you.  You were paying us.  Send us a check now.  Yeah, yeah, exactly.  It's like, oh, oh, we're not paying you?  You want to see us not pay you?  Now we're not going to pay you.  Right.  See?  You had to say we weren't paying you, so now for saying that, now you don't get paid.  But we weren't.  That was our complaint.  Why weren't you getting paid?  What was that?  You're bitching about us kicking your ass? 
[01:44:30]  You know what we're going to do?  You're going to kick your ass.  Right.  By the way, yesterday you were going on about Rocco?  Yeah.  No, but when you get mad.  Yeah, I know.  Your voice goes up like three octaves, so it's like a whole other person, so it's  sort of like, horny goat weed.  That, that, that guy, that Rocco's a son of your voice.  I know.  You become Harvey Villachez all of a sudden.  You're like, bunk, bunk.  It was great.  I know.  It was hysterical.  For like five minutes, I'm like, who is that?  Yeah, because that doesn't happen to Anthony often.  I just, you know.  The passion came out yesterday with our return to Boston. 
[01:45:00]  It was Billy.  You pent up for three and a, three years.  You're two.  Rocco, you're two.  You pent up for three years and four months.  That rage.  Finally able to come out yesterday.  You may have ass cancer.  You better be careful.  Ass cancer.  Tony.  Tony.  Hello.  Hello, Tony.  It's Junior.  I got the ass cancer.  Call Dr. Kennedy.  Hey, Ryan.  What's up?  Hey.  What's going on?  The casino, Tony.  Hey.  I got the big casino, Tony. 
[01:45:30]  This is two days in a row now.  Where's Jackie Jr.?  I almost run my car off the road laughing at you guys.  Oh, cool.  Oh, man.  The Rocco rant yesterday and then the Reagan bit.  I swear.  One more day like this, I'm going to turn my car off the highway and just kill somebody.  Ryan, we're just getting warmed up.  We're back in Boston, man.  Like old man.  Buckle on.  Make sure someone is not working.  You guys left, and I've been a loyal BCN listener ever since you guys came back.  I'm psyched you guys are back in Boston.  Oh, cool.  Spread the word and get the wow back in your car and support the show, right?  I get the wow sign sitting right in the back of my car. 
[01:46:00]  I'm sitting on 495 right now, but I got no takers.  All right.  Thank you.  Hey, thanks, guys.  All right.  Tony, that's what happened to Bacala.  Bacala.  After he made the hit on Tony, he was driving.  He drove into a pole.  Did you see him?  He drove into a pole.  He was laughing so hard.  I thought he gagged on a sausage sandwich.  Don't test me.  I got ass cancer.  I got the big casino, but Dr. Kennedy's curing me, Tony.  Where's Jackie Jr.? 
[01:46:30]  We got to take a break.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Paul Mercurio in the studio.  Paul Mercurio?  What?  That was good, man.  Boy, you heard that.  Yeah, I was in the bathroom.  I heard the whole thing.  It was good.  I was wishing I could get out here.  Sorry to hear about the AIDS, Paul.  I think Reagan thought he was spreading mercury for some reason.  It's coming along fine.  All right.  Yeah.  We're getting a lot of requests for this song.  People want to tape this thing.  What is it? 
[01:47:00]  It's your brother Joe's James Taylor thing doing DMX.  Oh, my God.  Do we have the DMX?  If it's not the Patty Duke song, I'm not listening to it.  I know.  A lot of people expect that from my brother Joe now.  But, no, this one's...  If James Taylor ever decided to do a DMX tune, it would sound just like this.  You know that song, up in here, up in here.  I'll just give a little sample so people can play along at home.  Yeah, everyone remembers this one.  Hey, you guys want to check in with the stoners next, too? 
[01:47:30]  See how bad they are now?  Yeah, we said we would check in.  For a couple of minutes.  All right.  You know...  All right, hold on.  Yeah, something's wrong with the CD players today.  You can't get the DMX working or the James Taylor doing DMX?  Call Radio Shack.  Fix that baby.  You know this song?  I know.  It's not up yet.  There we go.  Wouldn't you love to just shoot up a crack house to this music?  Like, you feel like just going in and just unloading a crack house. 
[01:48:00]  But, and holding the gun completely sideways.  Not like straight up and down like a stupid white folk.  I want to hold it sideways.  Yeah.  Clop, clop, clop.  It's going to be quick.  All right.  All your bands up in the jail before.  So suck my dick.  You know, look, I won't get done with it.  I'm quick.  You're going from the dog.  I can't understand.  You know what's amazing about Brother Joe's rendition?  Yeah.  He understands what DMX is saying here.  Good mind me of a strip club.  Every time you come around, it's like, well, I just got to get my dicks up. 
[01:48:30]  And I don't know who the fuck you think you're talking about.  Well, you know what it is.  When James Taylor sings, he's very articulate.  Right.  You can understand every word he says.  There's subtext to what he says.  So here's the same song.  If James Taylor were singing it.  Yeah.  It's Brother Joe.  If I got to bring it to your cowards, then it's going to be quick. 
[01:49:00]  All right.  All you men's up in the jail before.  Suck my dicks.  And all them other cats you run with.  Get done with them quick.  How the fuck you gonna cross the dog with some dumb shit? 
[01:49:30]  All right.  There go the gun clip.  9-1-1 shit.  All over some dumb shit.  Ain't that some shit?  Your niggas remind me of a strip club.  Cause every time you come around, it's like, what?  I just got to get my dicks up.  And I don't know who the fuck you think you're talking to. 
[01:50:00]  But I'm not like him.  I am slim.  So watch what you do or you go.  Find yourself very next to someone else.  And we all thought you loved yourself.  But that couldn't have been the issue.  Oh, maybe they just saying that.  Now, cause they miss you.  Shit.  A nigga tried to diss you. 
[01:50:30]  That's why you're laying on your back.  Looking at the roof of the church.  Preacher telling the truth.  And you know that it hurts.  Yeah.  Whoa.  Y'all gon' make news my mind.  Up in here.  Up in here.  Y'all gon' make me go all power.  Up in here.  Up in here.  Y'all gon' make me act cool.

And on the eighth day, God said, let there be brass.  Booms.  Wow.  102.7 WNEW announces our new fall lineup.  Sports Guys Mornings.  Don and Mike, Middays. 
[01:51:30]  Opie and Anthony, Afternoons.  Ron and Fez, Nights.  102.7 WNEW.  Ah, Sam Adams.  Oh, I love it.  Paul Mercurio drinking a Sam Adams.  It's actually my urine, but it's in a Sam Adams box.  You like the, uh...  By the way, you are the only people who make the people from Fox blush.  Yeah, I know, right?  Yeah, we'll talk about that.  Yeah, we drink it all the time.  We love Sam Adams.  It's hot out, right?  We're in the middle of one of those, what they call the heat spells.  It's when the news starts doing all those stories about the elderly. 
[01:52:00]  And we all know alcohol is a good thing to drink when it's really hot.  Yes, absolutely.  We're going to drink the alcohol.  Why don't you get the Sam Adams?  I'm sitting in your puddle of sweat.  I like, uh, you go to the beach, it's all hot, you just down straight vodka, and then  wash it down with some ice-cold Sam Adams.  Nice.  Yeah.  That'll rehydrate you.  Sure.  Oh, it takes care of it.  You just don't care that you're dehydrated.  Right.  Then you eat a cup of sand.  Nice.  Nice.  And Sam Adams.  They got the summer ale now, which is, uh, just great.  You'll love it.  Sam Adams. 
[01:52:30]  Mmm.  I want one right now.  Mmm.  Sam Adams.  Opie and Anthony.  1027.  WNEW.  Hey, Green Day.  Rock and roll, baby.  John Greenay.  The Opie and Anthony show.  Hey, shut up, you Greenay.  Seth, what's going on?  Hey, Seth.  Seth.  Seth?  You?  Hello?  Hello?  You on the phone? 
[01:53:00]  Ah, he had something good, too.  Seth, one more time.  Maybe that's not your name.  Just say hi.  Hello?  Hey.  Hey, you.  You.  Ah, you're right there.  I can hear you.  I hear your tires on the road.  Everyone that's on hold, say hey at the same time.  Hello?  Ah, that, you.  All right, you.  The one that went, hello.  Hello, me?  Yeah, you.  Yeah, you.  Okay.  What's your name?  What's your name?  What's your name?  My name's not Seth.  All right.  What is it?  It is now.  We were still talking to you, though. 
[01:53:30]  Oh.  Oh, thank you.  All right.  Well.  Coming from Boston, happy to hear you guys again.  I just want to say that I never thought in my life I would be so happy to hear the word  yam bag as I was yesterday.  Yam bag!  It made me realize that I actually miss yam bag.  Did we start?  Not the way you're going to say it.  Did we start saying yam bag in Boston, actually?  No, no.  Yeah.  That was when we, I think that was when we got here and Dice introduced it to us.  Yeah.  Andrew Dice Clay came on the show and he was talking about his yam bag. 
[01:54:00]  Okay, honey?  It's part of his tour.  He goes around the kid's school, little kid's schools and it's disgusting.  Hey, you little sons of bitches.  Let me tell you, you reach about 13, 14 years old, you get what's called a yam bag.  Mine's hanging like Turkish taffy in the heat, okay?  Can you do any, Mr. Clay, is there anything you can do to correct your yam bag?  No, it's like silly potty.  You know, some days it's so hot and sweaty, I put it on the comic strip, it picks up Garfield. 
[01:54:30]  And then I stretch my yam bag and what you got is Garfield's face stretching on my yam bag.  Oh!  Hey, Seth, so what's going on in Boston, man?  Uh, everything and nothing at the same time.  Well, spread the word.  Hey, stupid jackie.  Spread the word.  Spread the word.  We're back.  They should have given you the morning show, considering the new ratings that came out.  And, uh, Hillman and the morning show is getting beat by, uh, W-E-E-I sports radio. 
[01:55:00]  I mean, that's...  That station's going to...  That's that all itself.  AF is, uh, at the top of the little slide.  They had their little fun.  Uh, and now it's time to go...  Boop!  Let me, let me give it a sound effect.  Here it is.  Here it is.  Wait a minute.  Boop!  There you go.  That whistle came in handy.  It was awesome to talk to you guys.  All right.  Thank you, Seth.  Get a jerk off face!  Let's go to Paul.  What's up, Paul?  Hey.  Hey.  What's up, man?  Opie and I pack. 
[01:55:30]  Hey, man.  What's going on?  How you doing?  Uh, pretty good.  We're very psyched to be back on in Boston.  Oh, we're psyched to have you, man.  Cool.  I saw a New York car last week, Doc, coming out on 128.  It had a big wild sticker on the back.  I said, those bastards, they got the Yankees and they got Opie and Anthony.  Well, we're back, man.  Get wowed back on your car and spread the word, all right?  This is not a, you know, a one or two shot thing.  We're going to be doing afternoons three to seven on BCN for a long time.  Yeah, my wife was really having an open work yesterday.  She goes, how was your day, honey? 
[01:56:00]  I said, great.  I said, Opie and Anthony are back on the air.  Now suck my Yankees back, bitch.  That's a freaking York game.  Oh, cool, Paul.  Thank you.  I had Rocco.  He's a tool.  Well, yeah, he was doing that fake radio thing.  The Hillman was, uh, he was not saying nice things about you either.  Yeah, screw.  Screw the Hillman who does mornings at AF.  He's a douchebag.  It's over over there, Johnny.  He's a two-faced piece of crap.  It's over.  LB, I scored five goals in my career.  It's over over there.  I kind of like the LB, you know, if we're going to...  At least he was a party guy. 
[01:56:30]  If we're going to keep it honest, I kind of like the LB, man.  But Hillman, two-faced piece of crap, wanted everyone in Boston to like him.  So he'll talk nice about you.  And then to the next person, he'll talk bad about you behind your back.  Remember when we got fired from Boston?  He was on TV going, we are all upset here at AF over the fact that the mayor was upset.  Not even...  You just lost your afternoon show.  No, that didn't bother him.  Exactly.  Jack off.  Jack off, face.  Let me tell you, sometimes my yam bag is so full of banana juice that I could pick up the whole family circus. 
[01:57:00]  I don't understand what banana juice is.  Banana juice.  I'll squeeze my yam bag and you'll get banana juice all over you.  Okay, McCurichrome?  If you don't, be quiet.  So sometimes I could get the whole...  What do they call that?  The whole peanuts cartoon on my yam bag.  Guys, why don't you show them what the banana juice is, okay?  When I let it fly out of my yam bag, see what I do? 
[01:57:30]  I pinch the helmet, pinch the helmet, and the banana juice comes out of my yam bag.  Don't talk to me, Jack off, face.  He throws his web.  I throw web all over this chick.  He just calls it banana juice.  So I'm on line with this chick at the bank.  And I got my tongue in a bee.  I'm Spider Dice. 
[01:58:00]  Spider Dice.  Spider Dice.  Throw in web.  Hey, folks, that's the first portion of Dice's act.  He'll be back out in a minute.  All right, guys, stay loose.  We're going to be just taking a commercial break here.  Dice blew out a lung on that.  He's going to get his yam bag adjusted.  He'll be right back out.  Hey, thank you.  He's back at the Daily Show, warming up the crowd.  It's a small space, but it's not that small.  I need you guys to really fill it up.  Lots and laughs. 
[01:58:30]  Look how high the ceiling is here, everybody.  Call.  Hey, Jay, what's going on?  Hey, guys.  Yesterday was the best day of my life.  Why is that?  It was like Christmas time.  It's time.  Welcome back.  Oh, Boston.  Boston is checking in like crazy today.  Cool, man.  You guys don't got any Rocco tape because the kids around the country don't.  I mean, they don't understand how funny the frigging imitation is because anytime you  guys do Rocco, anyone I know around here just can't even handle it.  You know what I mean?  Well, you know, he was doing a lot of that fake radio, but we're back. 
[01:59:00]  And we're going to make him and his show look really stupid now.  Did you guys get the returns in town here from yesterday?  The what?  The returns on the ratings?  They don't come out until like months.  No, it's going to be a while.  We're starting from ground zero again.  We have no audience in Boston.  Well, you know, you're competing with a man-ass whooping.  So, you know, that might be tough.  Hey, shut up.  That's a great bit.  Nothing beats man-ass Wednesday.  Yeah, Whip-Em-Out Wednesday is back.  The real promotion. 
[01:59:30]  Right, right, right.  He didn't even have the balls to, you know, keep Whip-Em-Out Wednesday going after we left.  He decided to come up with Ass-Whipping Wednesday, a promotion where guys, check this one  out, Paul.  Would you listen to this on the radio?  You know, fat, sweaty guys with pimples on their butt would get naked and get whipped  on the radio.  Hot, right?  That's good radio, right?  Sounds like every Saturday night at my house.  Yeah.  Well, you know, and what is the, is there supposed to be something erotic about that?  Is somebody supposed to get off on it?  Yeah, if you're gay.  All right, you guys suck. 
[02:00:00]  Hold on, hold on, Jay.  All right.  Ho-ho.  Hi, Charles Nelson Riley here.  Could you do more of that?  Ho-ho.  How's that for a topper?  Ho-ho.  I like Ass-Whip Wednesday.  Nothing better than big fat man ass.  Ho-ho-ho-ho.  Rocco, I love your show.  Ho-ho.  Ho-ho.  Ho-ho.  Ho-ho.  Ho-ho.  Ass-Whip Wednesday.  Yeah, it's great.  Dave, do you like me?  Love me, Dave. 
[02:00:30]  Could be the gayest radio promotion I've ever had.  There are a lot of gay DJs on AAF, aren't they?  Oh, yeah, we're going to play Who's Gay at AAF in the future.  Steve, what's up?  Hey, how you doing, guys?  Hey.  I travel back and forth between Boston and New York, so it's wonderful to hear that you're  up here in Boston now.  I think it's absolutely great.  Cool.  But you're talking about us spreading the word for you to say, hey, listen to BCM in the  afternoon, to O&A?  Yeah.  We got AAF doing that for you in the morning.  And they were talking about you in nausea this morning. 
[02:01:00]  Yeah.  And then they'll act like, ah, but, you know, we're not worried about them.  But we don't need to talk about them today.  The Hillman in the morning show.  It's Elpy and Anthony lying again.  Revisionist history going on there, too.  Steve, I gave AAF, our old station, some free advice yesterday.  Just shut your traps.  I lived in the world.  It was beautiful.  I loved it.  You're playing right into our hands.  We have no audience.  Officially, we have no listeners in Boston. 
[02:01:30]  And the only thing that you're helping us by talking about us, because then everyone's  going to want to see, you know, what we're doing in the afternoons.  You're giving us free advertising.  There you go.  They're going to have an F up.  But they won't.  You know why they won't?  Because they're scared S-less of us.  They should totally agree.  Because we have to come back to Boston to reclaim our turf, my friend.  Hello?  Of course you are.  You think Dave Douglas will hotline you?  We're going to show you guys how fake all that radio has been for the last three years.  Fake weddings and fake fights.  Hey, you're cordially invited to Rocco's wedding. 
[02:02:00]  Who bought that up in Boston?  Who sat there listening and went, wow, Rocco's getting married?  Yeah, and I'm inviting all my listeners out to Worcester where I'm going to get married.  And then he does this whole big talk-up thing about this wedding.  And then at the wedding, where all the listeners are hanging out, was he broadcasting live from  his wedding like you would really want to do at your wedding?  What a fool.  Who believed this?  And it's like, yeah, get up to the altar.  If you, bitch, look, hey, I'm leaving her here. 
[02:02:30]  If she's leaving me, I don't know what the script said.  And then they had pictures on their website of, like, Rocco walking out with Dave Dickless,  the program director that has no effing backbone.  He's my best man.  Yeah, walking out with Rocco, you know, comforting him as they're walking out of the church.  What a load.  This is the type of radio they had a listen to for three years.  Did they get in their limo after that, the wedding limo, and just go, hey, dude, that  was the best, man.  Dave, pull your fly down.  I'm just going to suckle on you, because that's one of the best ideas ever. 
[02:03:00]  Pull out your yam bag and spray me with banana juice.  Oh, I'm Andrew Dice Rocco.  Oh.  If I could see my yam bag over my gut.  Oh.  Hey, Dave, your yam bag's full.  Let me take care of that for you.  The wedding bit was great.  So it was a fake wedding.  Fake wedding.  It sounded beyond fake.  It was so embarrassing.  They have a fake priest there to do the fake vows and everything. 
[02:03:30]  Oh, what a mess.  There's a little icing missing on my cake here.  Can you feel it?  Hey, is that cake icing on my mouth or Dave Douglas?  So then I've got to fill in, Paul.  So then one of the bride's stuff in the cake in his mouth, it was, hey.  Yeah.  All right, Steve.  Thank you.  Hey, quick thing for you real quick.  Yeah.  Too late.  Can you put the stinky cam on every once in a while?  Because ever since I was listening to you guys down in New York when I was traveling back  and forth, before you came up here yesterday, I was constantly looking for the stinky cam. 
[02:04:00]  Dude, I'll explain to you.  The stinky cam, they're updating the software for the server here.  Yeah, we have so many people checking it out there.  Yeah.  We've got to update the system.  It crashed every time.  But very soon, I think by September 1st, we'll have the stinky cam back in action.  And we'll probably just have it on the whole time.  Yeah, just on all the time so you can check out what's going on in the studio.  It worked very well for a while, and then we got listeners, and now it doesn't work.  Steve, we've got to let you go, all right?  So spread the word.  We're back.  And put the wow on the card to show everyone you're supporting our return to Boston.  Yeah.  We have had wow on this thing for two years. 
[02:04:30]  Come to Rocco's bachelor party here in the big city, Worcester.  It's going to be great.  We're going to fake a communion next.  Paul.  I'm going to get christened and circumcised.  This is the guy.  Come to Rocco's circumcision.  Come to the bris.  Dave's going to hold it while the moil laps off some flesh.  This is a real moil, folks.  Dave, hold it.  So this is the guy that replaces us when we get fired, right? 
[02:05:00]  Right, Paul?  So they're doing all these fake bits.  And then he had some success with this guy, Birdsey, right?  Birdsey.  It was Rocco and Birdsey.  And then Birdsey was having problems with his contract negotiations, right?  And Dave Dickless, being the spineless wimp that he is, he gave Birdsey an ultimatum.  And Birdsey wasn't satisfied with that.  So he pretty much said the contract's off the table.  You're gone.  You're gone.  Now the afternoon show was winning in the ratings. 
[02:05:30]  Hey, we're getting that.  With Birdsey and Rock.  They had no competition.  Right.  And Rocco continued to do nothing.  And I guess Birdsey was throwing ideas in.  Some of these fake wedding ideas.  Oh, my gosh.  So the bottom line, though, is Rocco did nothing to save his partner's job.  If somebody came in here and went to either Opie or me and said, one of you's out.  You're gone.  You think the other one is going to sit there the next day and go, all right, it's just me.  I'm picking a new partner.  Right.  You know, what kind of a spineless, it's Opie and I'm just going to, you know. 
[02:06:00]  He didn't even fight for his partner.  He didn't fight for his partner.  That was allowing him to win.  They had a little power at the time.  And if he would have fought and walked with the kid, they would have been fine.  And they would have been even, you know, they would have been huge in Boston.  But I wouldn't have Dave's Yan bag full of banana juice.  Oh, hickory diggory duck.  I read the risk.  I'm sucking Dave's.  Oh, I read the risk.  They were going to take my fake colonoscopy bit off the air.  Right, exactly. 
[02:06:30]  Fake alien abduction.  Come on, Dave.  Help me write it.  So he blows it and lets this kid walk.  That came up with all the stuff for the show, by the way.  Yeah.  You're like the old guy that's been around the block.  And this is the new kids making it better.  Spathetic is not even an old guy.  He's just, he's got no balls.  He's spineless.  And he lets Dave Douglas walk on him.  Yeah.  He sits there doing that show at a springboard station at best.  A station that you go to if you want to enhance, maybe work on your stuff until you get a better offer. 
[02:07:00]  Right, right.  Or until you get fired from saying the mayor's dead.  Yeah.  You know.  But he'll just sit there until he dies because, you know, Dave Douglas and him.  So where did the, where did the.  Rocco is Dave's robot, basically.  You know, the movie AI.  Yeah.  That's what's going on in there.  Fake sex change operation.  Dave, right.  This is going to be great.  He is not real and neither is his love.  I'm going to be a rock hit.  Slop off my schlong.  So, so that happens.  And now Rocco needs a new partner.  Check out this. 
[02:07:30]  Get this fake bit.  This is the best fake bit ever because you can't even fake this.  I mean, it wouldn't, it wouldn't take Columbo.  But Columbo, I did some investigating, ma'am.  What I saw was your partner that you picked at random worked across the hall at the radio station.  Get this bit.  Fake bit.  Hey, I need a new partner.  What I'm going to do, I'm going to fly a plane over Fenway Park.  The whole station gets behind this embarrassment.  I'm going to fly a plane over Fenway.  There's going to be a seat number on the banner being towed by the plane. 
[02:08:00]  Whoever's in that seat is my new on-air partner.  Could you see me or Opie doing this and one of us got, like, thrown out by the PD?  So, so, all of a sudden the guy that wins is this guy, Matty, who was, you know, supposed  to be this random guy.  He was doing radio across the hall at the other station for years.  And he's in the seat at Fenway with his cans on it.  Yeah, with his headphones and a microphone in front of him.  I'm doing a live remote and, oh, look, my seat number. 
[02:08:30]  How lucky am I?  What are the odds of that?  Hey, boy, thank God it was somebody with radio experience.  Could you imagine?  Not only that, his old man owns a radio station.  What a tool.  How fake.  How do you get on the air with something like that?  Did they bring the guy on the air, Marty?  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  And now Marty.  Matty.  Yeah, and they got him on the air.  That's his new partner.  But then, like, you could just check websites and he turns up, hey, I've been in radio for  years and I worked across the hall from Rockwell. 
[02:09:00]  The guy has a satellite dish on his back.  So, there you have it.  Just more of the fake, like, lane, and then the fake suspension.  Oh, we haven't even talked about the fake suspensions.  Which, by the way, Birdsey, when he did get fired from the Rockwell and Birdsey show,  called me at home and admitted all of it.  Yeah.  One of Dave Dickless' moves, like, when it's time for vacation.  Oh, let's make believe you're suspended for something.  We'll say it was, um...  It'll make you sound like you're edgy and you're crazy and out of control. 
[02:09:30]  How about this bit?  But they never copped to it.  No.  How about this one?  Hey, we broke into the boss's office and stole tickets to this concert.  What?  And we're giving them away now.  Every time you hear...  Yeah, all week.  And we're giving them away all week.  Like, if he stole them, the boss wouldn't go, hey, ass.  Boy, is the boss going to be pissed at me.  Is he going to get pissed?  So, when you hear the sweeper that says,  Rocco stole the boss's tickets all week long... 
[02:10:00]  How funny!  Who's falling for this?  In the middle of it, he's going, hey, boss.  Oh, no, no, he's not here.  Wait a minute.  Hey, boss.  And my boss is here to tell you how pissed he was.  I was very angry at Rocco.  Yeah, Dave.  Great bit.  Oh!  Jack be nimble, Jack be quick.  Watch me suck on Dave's.  Rocco!  Andrew Dice Rocco! 
[02:10:30]  Oh, yeah.  You know, Paul makes a good point on line 10.  Paul, what's up?  Hey, what's up, guys?  I can prove you two are stand-up guys.  Back in December, there was a little trouble with the station, right?  Yeah.  And Rick, your producer, almost got fired.  And Anthony, I believe it was, goes,  Oh, no, Jeremy, tomorrow you're taking the day off and Rick is staying.  Oh, well, Rick was fired.  No, Rick was fired, and Anthony and I walked out of the station.  Yeah, we walked.  We were not doing the show.  It was over. 
[02:11:00]  We said, no, they can't F with our show like that.  It's a successful formula of people.  And I don't know how Rick even fits into that, but...  Look at the face of it.  Hey, it seemed like the thing to do at the time.  Yeah, I know.  You know, looking back, we do have our regrets, but...  All right, Paul, thank you.  All right, Len.  Yeah, amazing.  Yeah, no one's firing Anthony without me leaving, too.  And we were getting Psycho Mark back online until he decided to sue the station. 
[02:11:30]  Wait, let's play that game for a minute.  How much would it take for you...  What, to walk?  For you to walk and why don't you stay and continue the show?  Is it...  Are we talking real money or fake money?  Is it money?  No, money.  Or what?  It's money.  It's money.  It's a penis enlargement.  Ah, okay.  If you could promise that I could warm up the crowd for the Daily Show.  Hey, you might notice we got some Hershey chocolate on the seats when you walk in. 
[02:12:00]  That's, you know, eat plenty of that and get the sugar buzz to get that energy up.  Now, Jon Stewart's going to come out in a couple of minutes, and he's going to feed off your energy.  So what we need is when he comes out, you're part of the show, people.  You're part of the show.  So we're really going to need you to really give him a warm welcome, okay?  Because Jon feels your energy.  Thanks a lot.  Paul Mercurio.  Thank you.  Uh, Sean, what's going on?  Sean.  I love that.  Why did I open myself up? 
[02:12:30]  Sean.  Yeah, it's you.  What's up?  Hey, man.  Hey, what's up, guys?  Welcome back.  Thank you.  Um, I just want to vow to you guys that I'll never listen to AF again.  I think everybody else should.  Well, we appreciate that.  You know what?  Maybe we can bury those friggin' pricks.  You know, we're just going to do some really great radio for you guys, and then it'll be up to you.  We're going to have a lot of fun.  And that's what we've been doing here for three years.  And you're going to see a noticeable difference in what they've been doing. 
[02:13:00]  You're going to be like, oh my God, that's what real radio is about.  It's really about hanging out and having a good time.  It's not about scripting some phony crap.  It's about, you know, sitting here and having fun with your friends.  You missed a word.  What?  Yes?  You missed a word.  What did I miss?  You said phony crap.  Phony crap.  And it says phony crap and stuff on the screen.  Oh, damn.  I didn't read it good enough.  Come on, everybody.  Phony crap.  Okay.  And stuff.  And stuff.  And you're going to have fun because it's like hanging out with your friends.  Line.  Hanging out with your friends. 
[02:13:30]  Line.  It's like hanging out with your friends.  Like hanging out with your fiends.  Fiends.  Friends.  Friends.  All right, listen, Ant, we've got to take a break.  Paul Mercurio, very funny man.  Yeah.  You need to plug something, man.  Brokerage, right?  My new partner, Paul Mercurio.  I picked his name out of a hat.  I was standing in line at McDonald's and I needed an extra quarter to get the super sign.  I need a partner and a new bride for my wedding bit and it's Paul Mercurio. 
[02:14:00]  He was at McDonald's and he just happened to be a comedian, too.  There's going to be a shark attack in two weeks.  The person that gets their leg chewed off and reattached will be my new partner.  My new partner.  All right.  Yeah, I'm at the brokerage Saturday night, the brokerage in Long Island.  Very funny.  He's got some great stand-up stuff, man.  Thanks, man.  Anthony, yeah, we've been focusing a lot on Boston because this has been a really big deal for us.  And I want to play this thing that Jimmy put together.  Yeah. 
[02:14:30]  For the newer cities that have no clue, we made our names for ourselves in Boston.  Then we were kicked out and we were kicked out for saying the mayor died.  You should have just said he had a big yam bag.  In a car accident.  We did it for April Fool's and it went horribly wrong.  April Fool, you now.  And we paid dearly.  Yes, we did.  People get less time for killing someone.  Yeah.  We were banned from Boston for three years and four months.  Spider dice.  Spider dice. 
[02:15:00]  So, Jimmy, who works with us here in New York.  Yeah.  Stayed up all night and put our news clips together and made this phenomenal piece.  The fighting crime, man.  Check it out.  April Fool's Day Hope.  WAAF DJs Opie and Anthony, who like to refer to themselves as demented, told their listeners Mayor Menino had been killed in a car accident.  At the time there, the mayor's wife, Angela, thought her husband was in a car on the way to the airport, so she thought it was true.  When the mayor's staff heard about the prank, they demanded a retract.  Totally irresponsible. 
[02:15:30]  Can anyone take a joke anymore?  Boston Mayor Tom Menino, thankfully, is alive and well, contrary to a radio station so-called equal fools joke.  WAAF DJs Opie and Anthony had announced on the air the mayor was killed in a car accident in Florida.  Tom Menino is very much alive and not at all amused.  It was an April fool's joke.  Right.  Albeit a tasteless one.  Right.  But, you know.  Well, some of the listeners actually found it very funny, and I do want to state that, because we're getting a lot of, you know, flack that it was just, you know, shocking. 
[02:16:00]  There was some comedic value to it.  Now, the mayor plans to file a complaint with the FCC, and he may even sue the radio station.  WAAF management says they've offered to let the mayor throw pies in the DJ's faces to raise money for charity.  But tonight, Opie and Anthony told me they will not go along with that.  What?  What?  What?  What?  This is where it gets stupid.  You think saying the mayor was dead was crossing the line? 
[02:16:30]  Uh, yeah.  I just wish, I just, I feel bad that the mayor's, you know, wife heard it.  Who knew that the mayor's family is fans of the Opie and Anthony show?  Tom Menino was very upset.  Adding to his anger was the fact that the on-air personalities never apologize.  We apologize to the mayor.  Never apologize.  I am sorry, mayor.  I will not accept the apology at this time.  I am sorry, mayor.  Opie and Anthony killed Menino.  Opie and Anthony killed Menino. 
[02:17:00]  This is going to get you fired.  I am sorry, mayor.  You make me sick, you fat sack of crap.  The station initially tried to parlay this incident into a publicity stunt.  Station owners did take the situation very seriously, and today, they acted.  Opie and Anthony repeatedly announced that Mayor Tom Menino had been killed in a car crash.  Now, WAAF has suspended the DJs indefinitely without pay.  Mayor Menino is also seeking sanctions from the Federal Communications Commission.  Aw.  Let's kick it. 
[02:17:30]  Today, Opie and Anthony were gone.  Fired.  Fired.  Opie and Anthony are unemployed tonight.  Opie and Anthony have been terminated.  Fired.  And that looks like the last you're going to hear from either of these DJs for a while.  And if the former WAAF afternoon drive duo are looking for sympathy, they better not look up at Boston.  I agree with that.  I think they should have been fired.  Absolutely.  I think they should have been fired.  It's like someone saying that my mom was dead.  Opie and Anthony are off the air for good.  Losers.  Opie and Anthony have been fired.  It was all just a joke. 
[02:18:00]  Opie and Anthony delivered the joke on April Fool's Day.  But the punchline knocked them right out of Boston radio.  Their dead air as far as their radio show is concerned.  That's no joke.  The station's keeping kind of a low profile as a couple of its top DJs go to no profile.  Instead of delivering jokes, Opie and Anthony are going to be delivering audition tapes.  Mayor Menino had no comment on that tonight.  But in the statement, he said...  Hopefully, this incident will give all broadcasters pause.  Pause.  Pause. 
[02:18:30]  For their next statements, which are false and irresponsible.  Piss off.  Opie and Anthony killed Menino.  We killed the mayor of Boston.  Don't ask them.  Opie and Anthony.  We're nobody's bitch.  Can anyone take a joke anymore?  Boo-boo-boo-boo-boo.  Wow.  Boo-boo-boo-boo-boo-boo.  Wow.  The Opie and Anthony show.  I find the most erotic part of a woman is the boobies.

And we're not giving out the New York number because it's slamming.  So don't...  Yeah.  Everyone's getting pissed.  You guys are talking about Boston too much.  You're not talking about Philadelphia enough.  You're not doing this.  You're not doing that.  Juggling.  It's like juggling, Opie.  You've got to keep everyone happy.  Give everyone their attention. 
[02:20:30]  Really fast, New York.  We're going to do a little party next week.  A magazine signing party.  Where we're going to have all the freaks there.

We're sending Keith and a bunch of other guys on Harleys with really hot chicks.  And we're going to, you know, hang out in Philadelphia all day.  That's going to happen next Wednesday.  Okay?  Right.  That's going to be huge.  And Cleveland and Sacramento and everywhere else.  Be patient.  We'll figure out things as well for you guys. 
[02:21:00]  Okay?  Mm-hmm.  We're going to try to talk to the stoner kids from Virginia one more time before we get out of here.  Our new friends.  I want to see if they enjoy the show today.  Yeah.  Also, we have a lady on.  We might have to do this tomorrow.  Claire.  Yeah.  What's up?  Hey.  Not too much.  How are you guys?  Pretty good.  I'm sorry we made you wait so long.  Oh, that's all right.  I was enjoying myself.  Oh, cool.  Oh, yeah.  I was reading Time Out New York.  Uh-huh.  And let me just read this for Anthony.  I didn't tell him you were calling today.  Okay.  It says, get advice from lesbians. 
[02:21:30]  Women know what women want.  And at tonight's Babes in Toyland workshop, sex tips for straight guys, lesbians tell all.  Sex tips for straight guys being told to us by lesbians.  Right.  It's Toys in Babeland, not Babes in Toyland.  So, Toys in Babeland.  Toys in Babeland, yeah.  Is it one of these parties where you just trade dildos and stuff?  No, no, no, no.  We're a retail store.  We sell the sex toys that we talk about.  Oh.  And, yeah, they're going to share their best tips and techniques on foreplay. 
[02:22:00]  Mm-hmm.  And then they say in parentheses, remember that, guys?  Oh.  And that cunning word, Anthony, the cunna, cunna, cunning.  Cunning linguist.  Yeah, yeah.  Cunning linguist.  Yeah.  Cunning linguist, sure.  And sex toys and more.  Right.  I like the foreplay that I use.  It's called the back of my hand.  Oh, that's charming.  That's not good.  That's not good.  No, no.  That's Andrew Dice Clay.  Oh.  Andy. 
[02:22:30]  Yeah, we don't like that.  Andy needs to come to our store.  Yeah, you need to come over here, honey.  I'll show you foreplay.  And then I'll make you sleep in the wet spot.  Oh.  Ew.  Dice.  Dice.  The guy is a, yeah.  He's a real son of a bitch sometimes.  Yeah.  All right.  Yeah, the stoners aren't picking up.  Okay.  Hold on a minute.  We're trying to get him on the line.  Dice in.  I think they pass in.  So, Claire, can you give our listeners a few quick tips, maybe?  Yeah, I sure can. 
[02:23:00]  We, well, every day we sell sex toys to straight men who come in.  And so we are doing this workshop sort of one at a time.  Yeah.  Um, every guy wants to know where, um, if I buy her a vibrator, is she going to stop sleeping with me?  You know, that kind of thing.  Yeah.  So we're just there to, you know, share all the information that we have gathered from talking to these thousands of men.  Well, you know what?  Just say, uh, backdoor action for that other thing you said.  Because they have, yeah, they have a problem with it on, uh, the radio for some reason.  Really? 
[02:23:30]  I can't, okay.  Backdoor action.  Yeah, I know.  Believe me.  It's stupid.  Okay.  Yeah.  Guys actually come in and ask you how they can get some backdoor action from their girls?  That's right.  Yeah.  There was one guy actually at this workshop who said, there are guys out there that are ruining it for everyone else by forcing the backdoor action.  Right.  You know, so here's this very sincere guy.  And that's when the fish eye comes in.  That's when the fish eye, you ever hear of the fish eye, Claire?  Yeah.  That's, uh, when, um, you slip, it goes into the balloon knot, as we like to call it. 
[02:24:00]  Right, right, right, right.  I've heard of that before.  You know, some men say, oh, it slipped, but they really, you know, it didn't.  Yeah.  Yeah.  But then the girl turns her head around and the eye looks just like a fish eye looking back at you when she turns her head.  Like, watch it.  And you're like, whoa, look at that.  Yeah, you need a little warm up before you just, you know, you're going to get the fish eye.  A fish eye unless you, uh.  Aisle driver?  I say, um, it should get to the point, uh, all back there where it just pretty much falls in.  Right.  Yeah, well, you can, you can work up to that.  So, so, so, so Claire, what do you, what do you tell these guys? 
[02:24:30]  Um, well, we tell them to do their homework, to talk to the women, see what they, um, no,  no.  You know what?  That's too clinical.  No, no, no.  That's too obscene.  So will they pleasure themselves alone?  Yeah, that's good.  Hold on, but now we've got to wait for the delay.  Yeah, you can't say either of those terms, but you can say, yeah, uh, take care of themselves.  Take care of themselves.  Take care of how they give themselves pleasure.  Okay.  Very, very good.  We ask them to interview their partners, to find out how they give themselves pleasure.  We basically tell them to. 
[02:25:00]  All right, hold on, Claire.  No, no guy's going to be interviewing their ladies.  Yeah.  You know what the guys at our store, though, do?  You want them to pull out their resumes, too?  Take some, take some oral dictation.  Right, exactly.  That's a good one.  Oral dictation.  Pull out the references.  I mean, I'm sorry, I'm going to have to let you go.  No, no, no, no, no.  So, we, uh, well, the biggest, you know, the biggest thing we ask them to do is to communicate  with their partners and to talk about sex over dinner instead of when they're doing it, 
[02:25:30]  um, to share, like, a yes, no, maybe list of different sex things they want to do.  Wow, you chicks got no clue about guys.  We have, oh, that's, no.  I don't like, you know, something.  We don't like talking about that stuff.  We just want to do it.  You just want to do it?  No, you want to do it better?  Yeah, but, but it doesn't, I don't, I don't think as a guy, it comes down to interviewing  and talking about it over dinner.  Well, interview's a little too clinical.  It's more like, you know, flirty, sexy.  It comes down to getting a little fracky in the bedroom.  Get my frack on. 
[02:26:00]  You know what I mean?  Yeah.  You got to get into the shack and not be afraid to, uh, you know, tear it up a little bit.  Ask for what you want.  Yeah, that's true.  That's especially true of G-spot stimulation.  This is how I talk to my, my, my lady.  OPS.  Honey, do you want it in Daz Dumpa?  Yes.  My fraulein, would you like me to infect your deep ear?  Oh, my God.  What?  That doesn't make you hot?  Uh, well, uh, no. 
[02:26:30]  What are your views on licking the dirty penny?  What?  What are your views on licking?  Are you for or against licking the dirty penny?  Licking the dirty penny.  Uh, you're going to have to define the dirty penny.  Oh, please.  What else on a human body could be called the dirty penny?  Well, it's not dirty.  You mean the sacred penny?  No, you know what it looks like?  Yeah.  Well, yeah, yeah, yeah.  It looks like a dirty penny.  Of course I know what it looks like.  I'm a lesbian.  And we're not, well, we're not talking about the, the front.  Ah, I was getting turned on.  Oh, I gotcha.  I gotcha.  Dirty, because the front doesn't look like a dirty penny. 
[02:27:00]  Well, you know what?  I got a lot.  That looks like a clam.  Yeah, everybody's got the dirty penny.  I, I think it's one of the greatest things you can possibly do to turn a person on.  Really?  Wow.  Man, woman, doesn't matter.  Hey, Claire, was it guys like us that made you go lesbo?  Yeah, it absolutely was.  She's like, I've had it.  No, it was women like my first girlfriend.  She's like, I've had it with men and their goddamn penises.  Right.  No, you guys, you guys should visit our website, too, www.babeland.com.  You should visit my website. 
[02:27:30]  It's going to be your back.  Hello, hello, hello.  You're going to find out everything you need to know.  All right, Claire, give us, give us like one tip, because we got to go.  Okay.  We're going to spend more time with you in the future, but.  All right.  One tip.  How about.  Sex tips from lesbians.  Okay.  Yeah.  Offer to tie up your own.  Oh, no.  What you could say is a ring that goes around your junk.  Really?  Hold on.  They dumped out all of that, Anthony.  Hold on.  All right.  Wait.  All right.  Wait, I can say yam bag, right? 
[02:28:00]  Yes.  Okay.  Use a yam bag stretcher.  This is your sex tip?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Offer to, you know, do something that's a little bit risky for you.  I'll learn.  All right.  And that will make her feel hot.  Really?  So put a stretcher clip on my yam bag.  Yeah.  And put a ring on my actual junk.  On your junk.  Right.  And, you know, like, let her play with it.  Give her a little control.  Man, you're angry.  That's not true.  You hate it.  You hate it.  No, you ought to want to do it.  It's all consensual. 
[02:28:30]  You're talking about a lesbian.  Take two lump hammers and smash your yam bag between them.  All right, fellas.  And then that is not what I...  And then that is not what I...  Put your junk in a meat grinder.  Fellas, you want a sex tip from a lesbian?  Take your yam bag and put it in a vice.  That's good.  Now take an M80 and put it in your dirty penny.  And light it.  No, no, no, no, no.  I'm just saying just give her a little bit of control.  You know, offer to be tied up.  You know, use a blindfold.  Let her be on top and decide where she wants your junk to go. 
[02:29:00]  That's what I'm saying.  That's all I'm saying.  Just give the woman a little control and she's going to feel a lot better.  Well, that's great.  I mean, but I think a lot of people are kind of doing that.  Really?  Do you guys?  What?  Do what?  What, together?  We're not like you, Claire.  No, no, no, no.  I mean, do you let your ladies have the control?  Oh, without a doubt.  Really?  A lot of fun.  Right on.  I'm glad.  That's awesome.  Yeah, all right.  Yeah.  Nothing better than the reach over.  Mm-hmm.  Right?  I like backward cowgirl.  Nice.  Oh, that's a good one.  What are you girls into?  Are you strictly oral or do you like the appliances? 
[02:29:30]  No, we like it all.  Appliances, oral.  Do you put the strap on?  Workshop.  See, just the fact that you're using the word workshop.  I picture Norm Abrams sitting there making a chest.  No, it's an informational evening.  Claire, can you explain something to me with the strap on thing?  Sure, you bet.  All right, you're a lesbian, right?  Yeah.  So you don't really like the guy's junk, right?  So why does it have to be in the shape of the guy's junk when it's on a girl,  and why does that make all the difference in the world?  Well, it doesn't have to. 
[02:30:00]  Like, a lot of women come in and they say,  we will not have a dildo that looks like a man's junk.  Right.  Yeah, both of them are a little angry lesbian.  But a lot of women come in and they want to, you know, play with their own gender.  They want to, you know, sort of appear to have a man's junk.  That's why they do the strap on.  Yeah.  But there's still a lesbian in there that's not happy that this is happening  because she's not into the male thing there.  Right.  Yeah, well, that's the thing.  It's not a male thing.  It's like a fantasy.  It's sort of a, you know, it's a penis. 
[02:30:30]  I mean, sorry.  A dildo is not junk.  Yeah.  It's not a man's junk.  Right.  You know what?  We have transsexual women coming in here who used to be men buying dildos because they're  lesbians.  That's bizarre.  Like, figure it out.  You know?  They had a damn scorecard.  Wait.  Yeah.  She's a what?  And it was a man turned into a woman and then they buy a strap on.  She turns into a woman, is a lesbian, comes in, buys a strap on dildo.  That makes no sense.  He just cursed and I had to dump out of him.  He said that was effed up.  That's pretty effed up. 
[02:31:00]  I hope he's insane now today.  I mean, it's not, though.  It's a, you know, it's all about, you know, making your sexuality what you want it to  be.  Hey, I've watched a few of those lesbian movies where they got the strap on and everything.  And it's very hot to watch.  Don't get me wrong.  But you girls don't know how to eff.  Like, I'm watching.  No, the girls that got the strap on.  I've watched quite a few of these.  And you're doing like the, you know, you're trying.  But unless you have a C, I don't think you really get the whole gist of it.  You might not be watching the right films. 
[02:31:30]  You got to kind of roll it.  You got to give them the donkey punch.  We can set you up with the right films.  You might be watching.  You got to roll it a little bit.  You ever watch some porno?  You ever watch male, female porno?  Oh, you bet.  All the time.  And you see the way the porno guy's got the hand on the hip and he's just slapping  a wrist and he's the yambegs banging.  Yeah.  You know, you guys don't do that.  It's very sweet and tender.  What I'm saying is you might be watching the films where some guy is staging two straight  women pretending to be dykes doing their thing. 
[02:32:00]  But if you watch the actual dykes doing it, you might see much more of what you expect.  Or what you would, you know, hope for lesbian.  And I know movies complete without the money shot anyway.  No, no.  That's not true.  You don't like the facial money shot?  Well, yeah.  Some women like it.  Not so much of it.  Hey, Claire.  You want to come in with some of your toys?  Yeah, of course I do.  It could be fun to see the latest.  Oh, yeah.  Rick, book it.  I would dig it.  You want to join our party on Friday?  Where is it?  Oh, we're doing Lesbian for a Day on Friday.  Really? 
[02:32:30]  Yeah.  Ladies that have the fantasy but haven't done it yet.  Oh, right on.  We set them up with another lady and they go at it.  Wow.  On your show?  Yeah.  Yes.  What do they do?  They do everything they want to do.  They get on the couch and they go as far as they want.  You know, we can provide the toys.  The best toys.  Look at that.  See?  Cross promotion.  No problem.  Salespeople are going to be thrilled.  Oh, yeah.  Let me in there.  I'm into it.  Sales who is.  All right.  We're going to call you, you know, tomorrow and we're going to set this up for Friday. 
[02:33:00]  You come in with the latest toys.  You can, you know, describe and explain them.  Right on.  And we can have some fun with that.  And then we'll have some lesbian things going on on the lesbian couch.  If you get turned on, you can jump in.  You know.  Cool.  That type of thing.  Whatever you like.  Thanks for inviting me.  I feel so special.  All right.  Well, thanks, Claire.  All right.  Back to your workshop.  All right.  Wear safety goggles.  All right.  All right.  There she goes.  Claire, the lesbian.  Making new friends today.  We're trying to get a hold of the stoners.  Yeah.  We said we'd check in with them again from Virginia. 
[02:33:30]  At the end of the show.  Yeah.  And I.  Oh, wait.  Is it just ringing?  Are they back on?  Hello?  Wait, hold on.  It's just ringing, Rick?  Dudes.  All right.  Our new friends from Virginia, they just smoke a lot of, and they're not picking up their  phone at all.  No?  They must be really wasted.  All right.  Dude, we burnt the house down.  Where's the phone?  All right.  We'll let it ring.

Uh, we've been trying to call you for the last hour.  What happened?  You know what happened?  Huh?  I tried calling you guys back, and the last four numbers are four wow. 
[02:36:30]  Yeah.  So I kept dialing four W, and then I saw the zero, and it says O-P-E-R, for operator.  So I saw the O, but I kept dialing nine zero nine.  Oh, instead of the...  Instead of the nine six nine, where the real O is supposed to be.  The letter O, where it's O.  O.  You're dialing the operator O.  Yeah, uh, you missed a little bit.  You missed, you missed some action over here.  Uh, Sean apparently, uh, couldn't handle his drugs and, and puked. 
[02:37:00]  What did, uh, Dennis puke?  No, no, no, Sean did.  Oh, Sean puke.  Sean puke, sorry.  Oh, I thought you were Sean for a second.  What are you people?  On soap?  Half of us is.  He couldn't handle his, uh, narcotics?  No, the toilet could, though.  So, uh, what did you guys think of the show today?  Dude, the show's effing crazy.  Right on.  Awesome.  Stop, dude, get the hell away.  Yo, he wants to spray, like, WD-40 on me. 
[02:37:30]  Get away.  Get the hell away from me.  Hey, uh, what was the craziest thing you guys heard today?  Uh, it's a tie between the entire show and, uh, Sean yacking his brains out.  Themselves.  That's right.  All right, we're going to let you go.  We just want to say hey, and, uh, it was good meeting you guys today.  Fellas.  Yeah.  Yo, if we get up to New York, we got to have beers.  Yeah, we'll definitely do that.  We're going to send a care package.  We're going to send you some good beer.  Excellent, brother.  Some nice Sam Adams on the way, all right?  Yeah, dude.  Um, yeah, you'll definitely, oh, hold on. 
[02:38:00]  You'll definitely recognize if we call back, like, some other day, but.  Yeah, we got your number.  Yeah, we're definitely, uh, we're definitely drinking some beers.  All right, right on, man.  Hold on one second.  We need a farewell from Sean.  Smoke weed every day.  Yeah.  Hold on.  All right.  Yo, dudeers.  Hey, what's up?  Pussy, pussy.  What are you guys up to, man?  Pussy.  I'm on the radio show for you.  You couldn't handle your crap, huh?  Nah, man.  We were playing a drinking game, but I didn't want to get up to get, uh, beers, so I was 
[02:38:30]  just taking bong hits instead of sips.  Oh, and it made me vomit.  Oh, it was crazy times, man.  Oh, it reminded me when I was on tour with Ozzy, and we snorted ants.  It was crazy.  Yeah, so, uh, how's it hanging, man?  Did you enjoy the show today?  Yeah.  What, did a black girl have a, uh, butterfly knife on him? 
[02:39:00]  I got a utility knife.  I think he stole my rims.  Bud, what's your problem?  Hey, bud.  Leave it to the end, man, you know?  All right, well.  Oh, no, I'm sorry about that.  That's all right.  But, you know, it's all fun.  It's all good.  The medications don't work.  The medications don't work.  All right, we're going to let you guys go, okay?  Oh, sweet, dude.  All right, we'll be checking in with you guys from time to time. 
[02:39:30]  Peace.  All right, there they go, the stoners from Virginia.  Mike's checking in, and he says, uh, all of us went to high school with these guys.  Yeah.  So, who's getting married?  Yeah, who's the guy?  My brother Kevin over here.  This is what you guys are doing for his bachelor party?  What more could you ask for?  But are you doing the chick thing somewhere?  No, we're doing the chick thing later on tonight.  Yeah?  We came down, we were hoping to get wowed earlier today.  Yeah.  We came up on a shotgun limousine and tried to get wowed.  We have wow stickers on the side and the back. 
[02:40:00]  Nice.  Nobody wowed us.  And then he came up from the Philadelphia area?  Yeah, man.  Eastern Pennsylvania, actually.  All right, cool.  Eastern Pennsylvania.  Poor bastard's only 22 and he's going down.  Yeah, can you believe that?  Me too.  Are you insane?  She better be pregnant.  22.  Anthony, do me a favor.  Talk him out of it.  Yeah.  You don't want to make that mistake.  All right, why are you marrying this girl?  Is she pregnant?  Not yet.  No.  No, not yet.  22.  22?  Are you insane?  Damn.  You got to try it once.  Well, that's a good way to look at it.  Get the first one out. 
[02:40:30]  I'm young.  I got a chance again.  Get the first one out of the way early, I guess.  Why not?  Hey, if you don't have a pot to whiz in or a window to throw it out of, get a parina up  anyway.  Come back to haunt you.  Try it once.  That's like going on the roller coaster early in the morning, isn't it?  Yeah.  Everyone was asking me, like, Anthony, you got to tell this guy, man, you know, talk  this guy out of it.  I'm like, no, it's like there's a pothole in the sidewalk and someone trips in it and  someone goes, watch out for the pothole.  It's like, oh, boom, the next guy falls in.  Now it's his job to stand there and go, watch out for the hole. 
[02:41:00]  And the next guy falls in and never stops.  There's no telling people.  The guy's in love, man.  He's going to get married and that's all there is to it.  My brother Kevin just stepped in the pothole.  That's great.  Yeah.  Now, are you doing something, though?  Are you going to the strip bar?  Where are you?  Strip clubs, yeah.  All right, cool.  So, nobody wowed us earlier.  We're hoping that maybe you guys would have some ladies in here for us.  Go to Privilege Gentleman's Club.  Privilege?  Yeah, they'll take care of you down there.  Privilege will hook you up.  Tell them you were the guys that were there today.  Rick will.  Now there'll be 20 guys out there.  That was beautiful. 
[02:41:30]  Now, Rick will call ahead and we'll, you know, they'll give you at least a little something.  You guys coming down with us?  We're busy.  We actually have fun.  Come on.  You're that whiffle ready.  We're busy.  We have a marriage.  Hold on, hold on.  We got a marriage joke that I want to play for this guy here.  Tony, what's up?  What's up, guys?  How's it going?  All right.  Hey, is Rick around?  Yes, he is.  I got a quick, like, 45-second joke for him.  How about it?  All right, go.  Woman wakes up in the middle of the night.  She hears some crying.  She looks all over.  She can't find her husband. 
[02:42:00]  Down in the basement.  There he is, bawling his eyes out in the back of the room.  She goes, honey, honey, what's the matter?  He goes, babe, remember 20 years ago when you were 14 and I was 20?  She goes, yeah.  Your father caught us having sex?  She goes, yeah.  Your father said either I marry you or I go to jail?  She says, yeah.  He goes, well, he would have been out today.  He's got a long sentence.  That was when Rick was going down.  A little marriage joke for you. 
[02:42:30]  That was a joke.  Isn't that a good one?  So is anybody single?  Who are the single guys that are going to be the guys that are just animals with those strippers?  It's absolutely going to be an act.  Yeah.  Well, let's see.  We've got a party of six and the ones with the bachelor and the rest are the singles.  And then everybody, because I know there's the single guys and then there's the guys with the girlfriends and there's the married guys and then there's the groom.  And only the single guys ever do anything with the women.  What guys are not single guys on a bachelor party, though?  Well, you know something?  When you get home to your chick, you better damn well not be the single guy. 
[02:43:00]  I'm not going to admit to anything.  When you're elbow deep in Samantha or whatever the hell her name is that night, you know.  Is that a referral?  Yeah.  Yeah, ask for her down at Privilege.  Nice.  Well, good luck to you.  Thank you.  Thanks, guys.  Yeah, best of luck in 22.  Wow.  All right.  Yeah, right.  You're wishing them best of luck and you're going, yeah, right.  This kid ain't going to make it past two years.  You don't know.  I'm trying to be nice. 
[02:43:30]  Could we get OTV betting on this wedding?  No, no.  The odds are much, too.  I figured I'd try.  Listen, why don't we play a quick round of what did we learn on the O&A show today, okay?  All right.  Steve, what's going on?  Hey, guys.  Great show.  Thank you.  I learned today that it's not this and God if you tear a page in the back of the Bible to smoke your dupe.  As long as there are no words on the pages.  And one word of advice from this guy, don't do it.  Later.  All right, man.  It doesn't matter what they say, right?  You're getting married.  Why not?  He's in love. 
[02:44:00]  He's going to be there at the wedding.  Clink, clink, clink, clink, clink, clink.  Oh, we got a kiss now.  Next time you hear clinking glasses is when she's throwing it at the side of your head.  Hey, Steve, what's up?  I don't know about that, right?  Hey, man.  If you want to turn on a woman, you've got to put your yam bags in a vice.  That's right.  That's right.  Very good.  Jersey Gary checking in.  I learned I've got to get me some of that fine Harry Potter weed.  Harry Potter weed, the one with the red hair.  I've got to get myself some Harry Potter weed, a Bible, and go roll a major doobie, dudes. 
[02:44:30]  If you can turn water into wine, you'll be the life of the party.  You learned that?  It was a very educational show today, wasn't it?  Yeah, we had some fun today.  Steve writes, I learned you're not dissing God if you tear a page from the back of the Bible and roll your doobie out of it.  I also learned O&A is better than watching Sally Jesse Raphael and that the Bible had credits.  Very good.  Credits?  I think we're just about done.  Yeah.  Ronald Reagan's faking it. 
[02:45:00]  Who saw that coming?  Hey, Joe, what's up?  Hey, guys.  Hey.  I learned that if you see the best concert of your life, you should leave early.  And most importantly, actually, two very important things I learned.  Paul has AIDS, and I learned stoners are funny.  All right, Rachel rules, guys.  Rachel rules.  You know what's fun to do at bachelor parties?  Let me just tell it for the single guys.  It's fun for the single guys.  You pick up some of that body glitter that a lot of the girls in strippers wear these days, right? 
[02:45:30]  I'm trying to get my brother busted.  And then what you do, during the night, at some point, you dab some body glitter on the married guys, the guys with the girlfriends.  They don't notice, but that girl, it's like a radar.  It's like a beacon.  It's like a friggin' lighthouse.  When they get home, they walk in the door.  Hi, I'm home.  Bah!  This stuff's reflecting off of them.  And watch them try to talk themselves out of, talk to their girlfriends or wives that they didn't touch the stripper. 
[02:46:00]  You know, my dopey friend's got the body glitter and...  Yeah, it happens.  And it's a great way to...  It's a great story to tell your girlfriend or wife if you did indeed touch the stripper and did get body glitter.  Just say your dopey friend did it.  I think I might try that, Anthony, just because maybe it'll sink it.  Oh!  It could be a good way to torpedo the whole marriage boat, you know what I mean?  Are you the best man?  I'm a little brother and best man, though.  You've got to give the speech and everything?  You've been working on it?  No. 
[02:46:30]  No, he hasn't.  He's going to wing it.  Wait a while.  Am I supposed to do that ahead of time?  Everyone wings it.  Wing it.  All right, we've got to go.
