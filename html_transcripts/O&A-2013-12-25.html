<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opened with E-Rock introducing "Opie and Anthony's Worst of 2013," a year-in-review segment. Opie recounted a frustrating experience attempting to return a lost wallet to its ungrateful Columbia University student owner, despite a $20 cab fare.  This was followed by a studio interview with Dwight Gooden, promoting his memoir "Doc," joined by David Lee Roth.  Gooden candidly discussed his struggles with drug addiction, career highlights and lowlights (including missing the World Series parade due to substance abuse), and his time in prison and rehab.  The conversation contrasted the different societal expectations surrounding substance use for athletes versus rock stars.  The segment concluded with a montage of Chip Chipperson segments, including a humorous news report in his style, and speculation about a potential appearance on the David Letterman show.


The show then transitioned into a rambling discussion about the reality show "Sing Your Face Off," veering into numerous tangents including offensive jokes targeting various ethnic groups and sexist humor.  False rumors about Angus T. Jones, Catherine Zeta-Jones, and John Krasinski were discussed alongside a detailed, graphic description of a man with an extremely enlarged scrotum (with a doctor providing medical details via call-in). A caller shared a personal story about testicular torsion.  The conversation shifted to a man dressing as a woman at work and the potential legal issues, a listener's anecdote about driving with one of the hosts, the hosts' podcast plans, a call from a listener who only cursed, and a discussion of the *Star Wars Holiday Special*. A phone interview with Sir Ben Kingsley about his knighthood and acting career was also featured.  E-Rock presented a gift to one of the hosts, revealed later to be from a famous, unnamed guest.


The next segment began with a game to guess the sender of a gift to Opie, eventually revealed to be Paul Anka, who had recently been a guest.  Anka sent an extravagant crystal decanter and glasses (not the cologne Opie had hoped for).  A clip from Don Imus' show revealed Imus received the *same* gift, exposing it as a mass-produced promotional item.  The hosts then discussed their planned O&A bus tour, with E-Rock suggesting unconventional locations, particularly Branson, Missouri, highlighting its bizarre attractions like a tiger show ("Kirby"), a Titanic replica, and themed dinner shows. The segment concluded with discussion of Crispin Glover's past appearance on the show, his controversial opinions on *Back to the Future* (criticizing its pro-capitalist messaging and Robert Zemeckis), and his criticism of Steven Spielberg's alleged pro-war propaganda in his films.


The show continued with further discussion of a potential broadcast from Branson, Missouri, focusing on logistical issues such as travel time (18 hours from NYC), airport access, and alcohol availability.  They mentioned various Branson attractions, including the Pierce Arrow Theater and Yakov's Dinner Adventure, playing audio clips of Pierce Arrow's music, which they found terrible. The hosts then shifted to planning a cross-country bus tour, detailing separate buses for Opie's "mellow" crew and Anthony's party-centric group (including Troy Kwan, Roland, and E-Rock).  A significant, vulgar, and sexually explicit debate ensued about the presence of women ("bitches") on Anthony's bus, involving internal SiriusXM politics and liability concerns, with highly offensive language used throughout.  The segment concluded with further planning discussion and humorous speculation on the potential for chaos,  and a brief interlude featuring E-Rock discussing Robert Kelly's baby registry as part of the "Worst of 2013" segment.


The show concluded with a discussion about strollers, focusing on the complexities of choosing one.  A video of a high-tech, self-folding stroller was shown, prompting reactions of amazement and skepticism.  The hosts then shared graphic details of one host's recent childbirth, including descriptions of the birthing process, amniotic fluid, labor, epidural use, and the initial emotional disconnect from the newborn. They also discussed the challenges of newborn care. The final segment featured a call from Kevin Pollack, who shared a song ("Hey Slobo, drunk fucking donut eater") that had been stuck in his head, referencing a nickname for one of the hosts.  Pollack then discussed his acting career, including anecdotes from his time on *Casino* with Don Rickles and Joe Pesci.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  Shocking admission. James Lipton. A pimp is somebody who exploits the women who work for them.  I was a tour guide. I would say, you want to see some sex?  Shit face buffoonery. E-Rock drank all the Patron.  Everything is blurry. And whatever this is.  Normally I like a couple fingers up my eyes. What the fuck happened?  Opie and Anthony's worst of 2013.  Worst of 2013.  No.  It's the worst of 2013 for the Opie and Anthony show. My name is E-Rock.  E-Rock Radio on Twitter if you care to follow. If not, that's really sad. 
[00:00:30]  We're looking back at the year that was. All the cool shit that happened.  All the cool people we talked to.  And all the annoying times that Chip interrupted the flow of a perfectly good conversation.  And today's show here, we're going to be looking at David Lee Roth is in studio.  He's become sort of a friend of the show.  It's a weird relationship, but Dave stops in time to time.  And in this particular segment, he's there with baseball legend Dwight Gooden.  And like I said earlier, Chip Chipperson. We'll take a look at him and what he's done this year. 
[00:01:00]  Paul Anka on the show.  And leaving a gift for Opie. We'll get into that.  Crispin Glover comes onto the show.  If you're not aware that most of the people on the show are big Back to the Future fans,  this is quite an ordeal for all of us.  We discussed the O&A bus tour.  What happened with that?  Bob Kelly.  Our good friend, Robert Kelly.  Bobby had a baby.  Michaela Maroney.  Something goes on involving her.  So we'll get into that a little bit.  And our friend, super fan, Kevin Pollack, just won't leave this show alone.  But starting off today's show is a bit about Opie. 
[00:01:30]  Over the years, Opie has sort of mellowed out a little bit after having gotten married,  having a kid, having two kids, and becoming a family man.  It kind of changes a guy.  And normally, in this situation here, old Opie wouldn't react as kindly as he did in this situation.  Opie found a wallet, and he was determined to get it back to his owner.  He explains the story.  What happened at the end?  Did that wallet find its owner?  Let's find out. 
[00:02:00]  Opie and Anthony's Worst of 2013.  This old babysitter shows up, and I'm sitting there, and she goes, she's young too.  I think she's like 20, I don't know.  She could be anywhere from 20 to 22.  And she goes, ah, this wallet was in the cab.  So I'm like, well, let's go through the wallet.  Give me that fucking thing.  I have no problem going through someone's wallet.  It's kind of exciting.  You get to learn about a person really quickly.  Yeah. 
[00:02:30]  I probably shouldn't give too much personal information, but he had a Starbucks card, like five credit cards.  He had phone numbers just written on business cards.  And it looks like he's some kind of really old student at Columbia University and all this shit.  No money in it.  So I'm wondering if she took the money, because most people take the money before they return the wallet, right?  Yeah.  I guess they do, right?  They do.  Fuck yeah, because then you go, ah, I don't know.  I found it like this. 
[00:03:00]  It was on the fucking curb.  So I'm sitting there, and I'm like, well, let's call the building, because I know his address because of his license.  And it so happens he's within a cab ride of me, and I can't find a phone number for the building.  Like, your building has a phone number, right?  I'm guessing it does.  It has to.  I call down sometimes.  Yeah, yeah, we do.  And my building has a phone number.  So I'm like, all right, I'll call the building.  I'll get somebody there, and then they could alert the guy that we got his wallet. 
[00:03:30]  I can't find a number for the fucking building.  And then I look up his name, and he's unlisted.  So I'm sitting there, and now I'm thinking, I think it's my responsibility to return the wallet.  So you're feeling like a good Samaritan.  And these Twitter assholes, and I mean that lovingly, I wish you would have told me ahead of time that I could have just dropped it in the mailbox, because I guess you could do that.  I didn't know that.  What?  A wallet?  You just put the wallet in the mailbox, and they figure it out.  Oh, really?  A lot of people told me that.  I didn't know. 
[00:04:00]  I figured everything would just fall out in the mailbox.  I never heard of that.  But I guess you do the right thing, tape it up a little bit, and fucking throw it in the mailbox, and then they'll look up the license, and they'll mail it back to the asshole.  They send it back.  Yeah.  The asshole.  Oh.  Postage two.  But I'm thinking if I lost my wallet in a cab, I hope someone would return it immediately just because of the hassle of calling all the credit card companies and all that shit.  I wouldn't even care if the money was gone.  I just don't want to go through the hassle.  Exactly.  So I'm looking around my house.  I'm like, I think I've got to go and return this wallet and be a good Samaritan. 
[00:04:30]  So I jump in a cab.  It was a $20 cab ride, by the way.  Holy shit.  Because it was rush hour, and I can't say where.  What part of the city?  Upper West Side, but way up.  Way Upper West Side.  Yes.  Yes.  After 110?  Yes.  Right around that area.  Wow.  You're brave.  You went into Harlem.  Okay.  I don't know.  I laugh at Harlem.  I bike around Harlem.  I laugh at it.  Harlem.  As long as the sun's up.  I don't laugh too much if it's getting dark.  Not as cocky as it's up. 
[00:05:00]  Oh, fuck no.  I know.  Opie and I am legend.  Fuck no.  I don't laugh as much.  Maybe a little giggle as I'm fucking telling as fast as I can.  Although no one bothers you really in Harlem, especially during the day.  What are you doing?  It's actually, it's great people watching up there, man.  Anyway, so, so I'm in the cab and I'm almost feeling good about myself.  Like, wow, look at you doing something nice for once.  Look at you. 
[00:05:30]  You're a good Samaritan.  So I show up at the building.  It's all awkward.  And there's a big fat fuck sitting in the lobby.  I go, you work here?  He goes, maybe.  I go, well, do you or do you not?  I got a question.  The doorman?  Yeah.  He was, he was an asshole too.  I gave away the punchline.  But anyway, I go, he goes, what do you want?  I'm like, I found a blah, blah.  I gave the name wallet.  And then he just picks up the phone, calls the guy. 
[00:06:00]  You don't want to maybe just talk to the doorman, huh?  See that episode?  Seinfeld?  It's hilarious.  The doorman.  Right.  Great.  But why didn't I just give the fucking wallet to him?  I didn't need to meet the guy.  You should do that.  I'll tell you why, because he didn't seem like he would do the right thing with it.  He was an asshole immediately.  Why would you?  I would have been weird about leaving it with him anyway.  I think part of it was, yeah, what is he going to do?  Because then, you know, he could just fucking be a bad guy and say, oh, look what I, look  what this guy just handed me.  Yeah.  For some reason, I had to meet the guy.  I don't even know why.  Because I didn't need a thank you. 
[00:06:30]  I didn't need cash, but I felt like I had to, like, put it in his hand.  So I hear the fucking, I hear him coming down the stairs and he shows up with this look  on his face, not happy, not smiling, not, doesn't even address me.  So I go, uh, we found your wallet in the cab.  You know, here it is.  And he goes, really?  Well, I just used the credit cards at a supermarket right around the corner.  I mean, I don't know.  I don't know what to tell you. 
[00:07:00]  We found it in a, I say it again.  You know, my babysitter found it in a cab and I came up here to return it.  Well, I just used this, you know, I just had my wallet around the corner in a supermarket.  I'm like, I don't know.  I go, I don't need your fucking money.  Like, all of a sudden, I lost it.  I go, I don't need your fucking money.  I'm just trying to give you your wallet back.  Oh, what an asshole.  So he just grabs it out of my hand.  And he starts turning to walk away and I just reach out my hand like this, forcing him  to shake my hand. 
[00:07:30]  He doesn't say thank you.  What a scumbag.  So then I leave his building like, this is why I don't do anything nice ever.  Yeah.  I'm serious.  This is why when the old lady falls on the fucking sidewalk, I turn and make believe  I didn't see it.  As soon as you get involved, there's always a problem.  No good deed goes unpunished.  What a scumbag.  Dude, not a thank you, not a smile, not nothing.  He's just being accusatory toward me.  Like I'm involved in some weird fucking scam. 
[00:08:00]  Like, you know, I took it out of his pocket.  Then I return it, what, and make a quick hundred or something?  For returning his wallet?  What do you think happened with that?  If he did say he just used it around the corner and then it was in a cab, what do you  think happened?  Did he get pickpocketed and someone jump in a cab or did he have it in a cab and just  fucking...  Well, then I'm wondering what the fucking...  What happened to his wallet?  Then I'm wondering how the babysitter was involved.  But then why would she tell me?  Right.  She wouldn't.  It's probably not.  She wouldn't.  Yeah, of course not.  She found it in a cab.  I go, I don't know what to tell you. 
[00:08:30]  What a dick.  My babysitter found it in a cab.  I came all the way up here.  Just give it back to you.  You know what?  You did the right thing because even though he's a douche, it really is a good...  It's just the right thing to do.  And I've had my camera return once and I was very thankful.  Did you go, give me it!  I did, didn't I?  And I punched you a woman right in her bad legs.  But sometimes you're going to get a dick.  You do it for you, not for them.  My first thought as I was leaving this building, man, I was thinking to myself, man, I got  to start dressing better.  Oh yeah, if the guy thinks you're fucking running some wallet thievery scam. 
[00:09:00]  I don't dress well as far as, you know, my status in society.  Maybe I should start dressing better.  Start dressing up a little bit.  Because this idiot thinks I'm involved in some fucking weird scam or something.  But he didn't even say thank you.  Nothing!  I can't comprehend.  How old was he?  I forced him to shake my hand knowing that would bother him.  How old was he?  Um, if I had to guess, late 40s maybe. 
[00:09:30]  Did gray hair-ish in shape.  Yeah, probably late 40s.  Did you want to say to him, like, are you really not going to thank me from coming here  from midtown and giving you a fucking wallet at my own expense?  I didn't know what to say.  That's just kind of shocking.  I was just, at that point I just wanted out of there.  Because I'm like, you're not involved in my life.  Unfortunately, these circumstances brought us together for a quick second.  I just wanted out of there at that point. 
[00:10:00]  Fuck him.  But you know what?  You were curious as to who he was and what he was like.  And you realize he's just a dud fucking asshole.  He's just a fucking asshole.  But the whole time with the cat, like, I'm like, I'm looking at the wall like, look at  you.  Oh, you.  I am good.  I'm good.  Look, see.  I'm being good.  I know I'm good.  And then you fucking end up going, like, I'm never fucking going to do that.  I mean, I was in a cab for, like, 15, 20 minutes.  I was stopping at every light because I was stuck in this fucking traffic. 
[00:10:30]  I'll never take back a wallet again.  No thank you card had been sent.  I didn't want money.  No.  Yeah, I guess a thank you I did want.  Of course you did.  That's fair.  Yeah, sure.  I couldn't believe it.  I can't believe it.  This is why.  You know, if you get involved with complete strangers, I just don't, I don't, I don't  see the upside to it.  I have my friends.  Everyone else is an asshole. 
[00:11:00]  That's how I go through life.  Did he look in the wallet when you handed it back to him?  He turned away quickly.  I was able to make him shake my fucking hand.  That was my way of, like, fuck you.  And then I'm thinking, what, is he now going to call the cops because he's suspicious?  Now I'm going to have to deal with that?  About what, though?  Who the fuck knows?  Was money missing?  There was no money in it.  I joked on Twitter I was going to take a Starbucks card for my taste.  Should have.  You got to get your taste.  So I figured, you know, I'll take this. 
[00:11:30]  If you knew the guy was going to be that big an asshole, what would you have done different?  I would take this.  You would not have brought it back at all?  Oh, fuck.  I would have threw it in the fucking garbage.  Not even a question.  Not even in a mailbox.  If I know what I know now, fuck him.  It's Velcro.  That sound.  Even though you don't bring it back.  If you knew it was him, you don't take, if you knew he was a dick, you don't take the  trip.  But you still get it back to him.  Because again, it's about you.  It's not him.  He's a cunt, but you did a good thing.  So fuck him.  I would have put it on a sidewalk or something. 
[00:12:00]  Let someone else deal with it.  Demagnetize all his credit cards.  That's a good idea.  Do that.  Send it back.  And it'll be like, oh, what happened here?  Right.  Hit Metro cards and a Starbucks card.  That would have been a nice little taste.  Yeah.  Well, maybe he's losing his mind.  You know what?  Maybe he's fucking, maybe he's, he's kept memory loss and he can't believe this happened  again.  And instead of thanking you, he's like, what's happening to me?  Why?  I just used this and now it's gone.  What is wrong with me?  Maybe he's just mad that he lives up in Harlem.  Maybe he's got a lump on his brain and he's fucking, he realizes that he's losing his life 
[00:12:30]  quickly.  Yeah.  Don't try to make him a nice guy.  He was just an asshole.  I know.  I'm just kind of put a, a lump on the brain.  Lump on the positive.  Oh yeah.  Yeah.  It gets worse.  More of Opie and Anthony's worst of 2013.  Worst of 2013.  Coming up.  Opie and Anthony's worst of 2013.  2013.  2013.  2013.  2013.  2013.  2013.  2013.  2013.  2013.  2013.  2013.  2013.  2013.  2013.  2013.  2013.  2013.  2013.  2013.  2013.  2013.  2013.  My name is E-Roc. 
[00:13:00]  I'm hosting this thing.  Hi.  How you doing?  Get what you want for Christmas?  I don't know why I'm talking like that, but I'm going to stop that now because we need to talk  about David Lee Roth in studio.  Dwight Gooden was coming in.  If you're not familiar with Dwight Gooden, former Major League Baseball pitcher for the  Yankees and for the Mets, he's in studio to talk about his brand new book, Doc, A Memoir,  and he's very open and honest.  Most people are not like this, especially athletes, but he's very open and honest about his heyday 
[00:13:30]  in baseball and all the drugs and everything that he went through, and we're having a good  time.  We're hearing a lot of cool shit that is when David Lee Roth allows him to speak.  ONA's Worst of 2013.  The great Doc Gooden has just entered the studio.  My God.  Mike Gooden.  Wow.  Very cool.  We didn't know this was happening today.  This is great.  How are you, man?  Is there an occasion?  What's the occasion?  That's a good question.  Is there specific occasions your book is brand new? 
[00:14:00]  It's a memoir.  Definitely.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Memoirs, huh?  Yes, sir.  That's of quite the career.  Are they good memories or bad memories, or are they saleable?  Oh, there's a little bit of everything in there.  It's the good memories, the bad memories, the not-so-good memories, what was going on  in my head during the times of the good memories and the bad memories.  Yeah, yeah.  You start the book with a chilling, it's like a really sad and frustrating story about the  World Series, the parade, and when you missed that, it's fucking heartbreaking. 
[00:14:30]  Even though I knew how it ended, I kept hoping, like, just go, just go, you're watching this  frustrating, drug-addicted...  Yeah, but nevertheless, somebody once said, if somebody made a movie of your life, would  a lot of people go to see it, and it sounds like a lot of people would, and that's a success  story.  That's a success story that I'm still alive to tell the story is amazing.  Hello.  Right, right, right.  Which is Yiddish for yo.  Come on.  Definitely, because what you mentioned, missing a parade that night was supposed to be the  happiest day of my baseball career.  Uh-huh. 
[00:15:00]  It turned out to be the saddest day of my baseball career.  You know, you end up in a project, you're doing drugs, and drinking with strangers you  don't even know, and, you know, you're watching the parade on TV.  That was me.  That was you?  That was me.  And the thing about it, you don't get to redo that.  Right, right.  That's a one-off, man.  If you miss it, that's a big one.  But talking about the people that you were getting high with, and how, like, you know,  you start off the night loving these people, and it's fun, and it's camaraderie, and then  by the end of the night, you're just like, I want to just get the fuck out of here, and 
[00:15:30]  the sun is coming.  I mean, like, knowing that you're about to miss it, and it happens anyway.  Oh, it's just a, I mean, the worst experience you could ever imagine in your life.  Because, like you said, the idea was to go there, do a little bit, and get out of there  and go finish, you know, celebrating with my teammates.  Obviously, I got there, and it never ends that way.  Not for me, anyway, with cocaine.  Normally, when I go on a bench with that, it's a three-day thing, and that's just the  way it is.  And cocaine's a tricky drug.  Wow.  Oh, in my rock band, getting loaded wasn't like an episode thing.  It was a seasonal thing. 
[00:16:00]  It's like, first, okay, it's summertime, let's get loaded.  Right.  Oh, yeah, it's definitely, it's Tuesday, let's get loaded.  Yeah.  No, no, I mean all summer.  All summer.  All summer.  All summer.  Were you a drug guy, David Lee Roth?  No, I'm a beer and pot guy.  That's what I thought.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  I'm an outdoor kind of, you know, I got lucky.  My bad habits are more like two chicks in a toaster oven, but we'll be there.  That's, please, continue.  You're staying away from the white stuff, huh?  How old are you?  No, no, I did everything.  I sampled everything.  I tried everything.  But I just snuck out from under it because I had, I was going to also be a summer eye 
[00:16:30]  warrior, you know, and I had to be in the gym.  But that's the only reason.  I didn't have any self-control for about 20 years.  Were they piss testing back then in baseball?  Because it's amazing to me that you were able to do all that coke and still play and not  get kicked out?  Well, it was a situation where normally they can't test you unless you've been through a  program or you tested positive before or got in trouble or something like that.  Up until the time when the Mets decided to test me in the spring training in 1987, I  hadn't been in any trouble for it.  There's a lot of, there's a pattern there that could have led to that, that they could 
[00:17:00]  have saw what was going on.  So, actually, in spring training in 1987, it got to the point where, obviously, you  miss the parade after the 86 season, get into a scuff with the cops after the 86 season,  get to spring training, you know, showing up late.  They knew something went wrong.  And one day they called me in and said, we'd like to test you.  Me not knowing the whole thing, all I knew is I enjoyed doing cocaine, not knowing how  long I stayed in the system, not knowing that I had my rights that I could have refused  to test.  So, I figured I hadn't done nothing at the end of the day, go ahead and test me. 
[00:17:30]  And by doing that, it was a good thing and a bad thing.  Obviously, the test came back positive.  At that point, they said, we need you to go to rehab and we'll continue to pay your  salary.  Or, if you choose not to go to rehab, we're going to suspend you without pay.  So, even though I still was in denial, didn't think I had a problem, I decided I'll go to  rehab.  I'll count the days down, you know, 30 days until I'm done.  And I still get my pay.  So, obviously, I went to the rehab.  To Smithers was a great program.  But I didn't try to get anything out of it because I still think I had a problem.  Who even knew what rehab was in those days? 
[00:18:00]  That was something you sent Uncle Bob to when he was up to a court or whatever.  People still thought cocaine wasn't addictive, that that was rock star stuff to do.  And a lot of times, you'd sign up to go into showbiz so you could do that.  We decided we were going to break all the records, those included.  You know, we were going to make Elvis look like a beginner.  I was going to make Keith Richards look like a freaking Boy Scout, you know?  So, these days, the perspective on it is very different.  The reality entered into the picture, of course.  But it's totally different now.  And, obviously, like you said, you think it's not, you know, addictive or whatever. 
[00:18:30]  But, and then, plus, the danger of it now, you don't know what's in this stuff you're  taking.  Oh, man.  What was the first sign?  Because you said that, you talked about when you missed the parade, but before that, the  Mets had been, there had been rumors about your drug use.  And what was the first sign, or what first tipped them off to, like, ugh?  Who are you looking at, Jim?  I think what tipped them off was, you know, hanging out at different party spots in the  city where, you know, basically drugs are known to be at, and hanging out at those 
[00:19:00]  places.  So, obviously, Major League Baseball called myself in and questioned me, as well as Daryl, about,  you know, using drugs.  And, of course, you deny it.  Sure.  No, it's not me.  And, of course, Daryl said, no, it's Doc.  You know, but that happens.  But, you know, at that time, obviously, I was using.  And, you know, at that point, I refused to be tested by Major League Baseball.  Where do you think this came from?  Because, you know, anybody looking in from the outside, you're at the top of your game.  I mean, you're a star.  World Series.  I mean, where do you think that came from? 
[00:19:30]  Well, I can tell you exactly where it came from.  It came from all the pressure, all the expectations, not only from the media, but then the expectations  I started putting on myself.  For example, like, 84, my rookie year, when I came into the league at 19 years old, really  wasn't much expectations after the All-Star break.  Then especially the game.  And then I have my career year in 1985.  So, 86, everything I did was compared to 85.  You know, for example.  86 was a good year.  Yeah.  That was a great year. 
[00:20:00]  It was three months shorter than most years because it was up all night, though.  Yes.  Yep.  Gotcha.  So, now, like, if I won a game against, say, like, Fernando Banasuello or Hirschhauser,  if I won 2-0, you know, complete game shutout, but I only had four strikeouts, the first  question would be, what happened?  You only had four strikeouts.  Oh, wow.  So, the next start, I'm going out trying to get 10 strikeouts, trying to pitch a complete  game, trying to pitch a shutout, and just all expectations, just trying to live up to  that, and what I started doing was medicating myself, you know, with drugs and alcohol.  So, you listen to the critics. 
[00:20:30]  Athletes, I know, get, like, you know, entertainers get critics and stuff, and athletes get  killed on the back page.  That would affect you, what they were saying about you?  Oh, 100%.  I think most players, maybe it's a 2%, maybe it don't affect, but myself, you know, obviously,  unfortunately, being a people pleaser as well, I pay attention to the papers, pay attention  to what's being said, and anything you see, it affected me because now I've got to go out  and I've got to do better, and it took away the fun of the game.  And you would, it was nice to read, too, you talked about your father a lot and what an  influence he was, and you were the first boy in the family, so he became obsessed with 
[00:21:00]  just you and baseball, and you would call him after every game and kind of share that  with him.  Yeah, definitely.  My dad is the one that really taught me the game.  I remember as a kid, sitting there watching the games on TV with him.  Back then, there wasn't all the baseball networks.  You just got the game a week on Saturday.  They wouldn't have a game on the radio, whatever the team was, you know, local, close by at  that time, and I watched the games, and he taught me the game.  So, once I made it, after every game, we had this deal where he had a big salad dish back  then, after the game was over, before I even talked to the media, I'll call my dad, you 
[00:21:30]  know, we'll talk about baseball, and go over the game, what I could have done differently.  Even if I pitch a shot, he'll find something that could have been done differently, just  to kind of keep me humble.  Would that bother you if he criticized it, or would you actually look for his advice  and counsel on what you did wrong?  I always look for it.  It didn't really bother me, because what he's doing is trying to, even like, say, like  during the 85 season, he was just trying to give me something to work on between starts  where you don't just settle for having a good game.  Did he know you were in trouble with drugs at that point?  You know, it's funny, like I talked about a lot in the book, where in 87, when I tested 
[00:22:00]  positive, I had to come home and tell my parents that, you know, I got to go to rehab.  My mom, she always knew something wasn't right.  I think my dad kind of looked the other way a little bit, and plus my dad, you know, he  had his drinking problem as well.  So, when I told him, you know, I failed the drug test, I had to go to rehab, my mom basically  said, well, that's great, you can get the help you need, where my dad just kind of  dropped his head.  Oh, wow.  And never said a word.  Wow.  He doesn't want the spotlight at that point in time, you know.  If he's got an issue, then, you know, a little bit of your spotlight of that issue would get 
[00:22:30]  towards him.  I had too many temptations.  It was started off as, Jesus, the longer I stay up, the more girls we can sleep with,  and the more guys we can go jam blues with, and then we can just stay up all the way until  we're into the next city.  And we could do that for three days in a row, you follow?  Well, that's why we started drinking Jack Daniels.  But the press looks at a rock band and goes, like, cool, that's cool.  Oh, well, you're supported.  You're supposed to do it.  It's a completely different world. 
[00:23:00]  Like Dwight, and it's like, what are you doing?  Yeah, you're a little bottle.  I don't think he could have been swigging Jack Daniels.  Right, right.  In the dugout.  Woo!  Woo!  In my department, people get upset if you didn't party.  Right, that's what I'm saying.  Actually, I kind of like, I'm thinking about doing another marathon.  They go, whoa, whoa, what happened to, you know, two or five in the morning, Dave?  The Mets PR has its own pressure on you as well.  The Mets PR wouldn't be thrilled.  Doc, fuck two girls.  Get a picture out quick.  Oh, God. 
[00:23:30]  It's, you know, rock stars and athletes, I think, have different expectations.  Yeah, a totally different game, but I definitely have a lot of respect for what you've got to do.  Oh, God.  You told a great story, too, in the book about your dad being shot by, or shot at by your mom.  So you grew up in a very interesting house.  Yeah, it was very interesting.  As a kid, you know, unfortunately, and I'm sick it may sound, but I just thought those were normal things that took place in every family.  Yeah.  Well, they kind of are. 
[00:24:00]  Depending on what point of the map you're pointing at, it's not so unusual.  A lot of neighborhoods, that is common life and so forth.  You know, please.  Yeah, so when that happened, actually, my dad was having an affair, and a lot of times he'll take me, he'll tell my mom that I want to go get some cookies and juice or whatever.  What he would do is ask me, you want to go to the store, which any kid would say, yes, I want to go to the store.  So I'll go to the store, we'll get the cookies and juice, and then we'll go to his girlfriend's house.  Because her oldest daughter would come outside in the car and kind of babysit me while he's in there taking care of his business. 
[00:24:30]  And somehow my mom found out what was going on, and this one particular day, she followed him to the house.  And when him and the woman's coming out, she actually, you know, shot at him and the woman.  She actually hit him in the shoulder.  And she always told me the story where she was upset that she didn't get the woman as well.  Wow.  Wow.  I mean, her mom was the sweetest lady, but also she could be the toughest lady.  Oh, man, woman scorned.  We got a question from the guy in the corner.  Hey, Doc. 
[00:25:00]  Jay Moore.  I'm in hard.  It's ironic to me, like, when you get high as an athlete, I don't think you guys are aware of the high you provide us on a daily basis.  I was at your no-hitter at Yankee Stadium.  It was just a Tuesday.  That's all I remember most about your no-hitter.  It was just a Tuesday.  And that's a no-hitter.  It's the craziest thing you could ever be a part of because the Super Bowl, the World Series, the All-Star Game, you bring all your hype with you. 
[00:25:30]  A no-hitter, it's fucking Tuesday.  And your friend goes, do you want to come?  You're like, eh, all right, you know what, I'll go.  And then by the seventh inning, you can't breathe.  And then you threw, like, 190 pitches in that game.  You walked in, it was the Mariners, and it was like Paul Sorrento, Jay Buehner.  Well, listen to that memory, huh?  Ken Griffey Jr., like, the last five guys you faced, it was like, oh, my God, it's in the seventh inning.  Is he going to come out for the eighth?  Eighth inning, now he's got to come out for the ninth.  That was probably athletic viewing. 
[00:26:00]  Second place being Larry Johnson hitting the three in the garden against the Pacers.  Your no-hitter was like, that was the biggest high for me in the world.  So it's just ironic that so many athletes fall into the traps of drugs.  But I guess that's what we're all doing.  We're just chasing the dragon every time we go to the stadium.  At the end of a game like that, you feel as tired as the guy actually playing.  Yeah.  Were you high on the air?  On the air, on the mound?  I was never used before the game.  Never used before the game or during the game or anything.  I was never used.  That's self-control right there. 
[00:26:30]  But it was already premeditated after the game.  What about Daryl?  Did he use during the game?  After the game, I was going to use either to celebrate or I was going to lose.  I mean, use because I was pissed.  Right, right, right.  For those Daryl, I'm not sure.  I'm not sure what he did.  Wait a minute.  Is that the breakfast of champions that you're eating?  Yes.  Thanks for pointing it out there, David Lee Roth.  Trying to finally eat breakfast.  Multi-grain Cheerios if you need to know.  In The Bad Guys 1, there's been a bunch of Mets books about that era.  And it seemed like, and I'm not asking you to air your guy out or throw your guy under 
[00:27:00]  the bus under any situation.  But in case you do.  You can only speak for yourself.  I know that.  But it seemed like once the test started coming back, there seemed to be this sort  of like, oh, you got to talk to Daryl.  Or Daryl would say, oh, you got to talk to Doc.  This sort of like running back and forth.  Like, it wasn't me.  It was him.  It wasn't him.  It was me.  Was that the media making that up?  Or was it like, I'm going to get suspended?  I better.  Well, no, not at all.  For me, anytime the rumors came around with me, they asked me, or even after when I 
[00:27:30]  failed my test in 87, the Mets in Major League Baseball, and there was, who was you using  them with?  What was your teammates?  You better tell us.  If you don't tell us, this is what's going to happen.  And I just said, well, and the truth was, I was basically using it by myself.  I mean, me and Daryl used it together occasionally, like, say, in 86.  But outside of one or two times, that was it.  You know, obviously, he's been public with his troubles.  I mean, public with mine.  But we never really partied together.  Are you sober now?  Are things good now? 
[00:28:00]  Yeah.  Two and a half years.  Oh, cool.  Things going well.  I like that.  Let's do it.  Thank you.  I've got 32 days clean and sober.  Not in a row.  Of course.  Not in a row.  Since January.  That's got to be weird to be at a meeting in Doc Hood and sitting across from you sharing.  I'm like, hey, I had a rough day.  My barbecue didn't fire up.  And you're like, well, when I won my World Series ring, you're like, wait a minute.  Is this the 3 o'clock Moorpark meeting?  Where are we? 
[00:28:30]  There is a 3 o'clock Moorpark meeting, huh?  I know.  And a 1 o'clock.  It's amazing you say that, though.  But, you know, anytime I'm in the meetings, you know that obviously everybody's in there from different walks of life.  Yeah.  But we're all there for the same come and go.  That's right.  And that's the main, you know, help each other stay clean and sober just for that day.  Yeah, it is.  Tomorrow, do the same thing.  It is an amazing, we'll just say, program that it really is when you walk in, nobody gives a shit.  We're all just trying to keep our lives together.  It's pretty cool, yeah.  Yeah.  That's the main thing. 
[00:29:00]  What's good about the book, too, is, and listening to you talk, we were talking about when people write something in the book,  Dave and I were talking about how they don't want to talk about it on the air.  And you're brutally honest.  It's great.  Like, that really makes people want to read a book.  It's like, you're not coming in going, well, I don't know, God.  You're like, just fucking, this is everything that happened.  Here it is.  And that's what I wish everybody would do when they put out a book and they talk about their life.  It's brutally honest.  If I don't see myself reflected in your eyes, I'm going to get out within 30 seconds of your story.  You follow? 
[00:29:30]  And the stuff that attracts me most to people's stories and people's backgrounds are the flaws.  The cracks in the woodwork, the fractures.  Your favorite jeans are the ones that are most fucked up with the holes in the knees and the old boots that aren't polished.  And that's the most interesting thing about each other as human beings.  As long as there's no hole in the back of the jeans.  But that you mentioned that, you know, for me, what kept me sick for so long is like, you know, you're sick is your secrets.  And for a long time, like you mentioned, I would tell half the story.  I wasn't comfortable telling the whole story.  It took a while for me to admit that I have a disease. 
[00:30:00]  It took a long time to admit that I'm an addict.  I'm an alcoholic.  Those words when I said it, I kind of stumbled over them because I was still in denial.  And to me, it was like, that means you're weak.  So I found it to a point that, hey, I'm dying thinking I've got this stuff under control.  Because, I mean, I've been to prisons.  I've been to jails.  I've been to rehabs.  So the only thing left for me is the cemetery if I choose to go back out there.  So it was just a time in my life where I was just tired of living that lifestyle.  And when you surrender, you have to surrender everything. 
[00:30:30]  Because I was trying to hold on to the lifestyle without the alcohol and drugs.  But it doesn't work that way.  So I had to come clean and just get, this is what happened.  Like you say, this is not who I am today.  But these things that I went through, and I can go right back to that if I was to choose to pick up or take that one drink.  And how long were you in jail for?  I mean, we all remember when you went.  And it's weird to see such an iconic figure go, you're like, oh my fucking God, that is what happens when you keep going.  It was a horrible time.  I mean, I was in jail for, well, prison actually, for 10 and a half months.  It's tough to go to prison at any time in your life. 
[00:31:00]  But to go in at 40 for the first time was horrible.  Especially when you have little kids, you know, and daughters especially, where if something happens, there's nothing you can do.  Wow, yeah.  You only get a 15-minute phone call per day.  And if you miss that time, you know, Big Bubba ain't going to give up his time.  You're done.  That's just the way it is.  How did they treat you in jail?  I mean, was it because you are who you are?  Was that good or bad?  It was a little bit of both.  When I first got there, I think it was a situation where they wanted to see how you was going to come in, how you was going to be just based on the name.  Right away, they made it known that in here, there's no names. 
[00:31:30]  Right, right.  You're a number, and you're no different than the other guy.  You're going to pick up the trash.  You're going to do it when I tell you.  You're going to shower when I tell you.  You're going to wear what we tell you to wear.  You're going to clean up the yard when we tell you.  You're going to eat when we tell you.  And you're going to eat what we tell you.  So it was a whole big adjustment.  But I just came in, tried to be as humble as I can.  I just kept my distance from everyone.  And as time went on, you know, we started to kind of, I wouldn't say fit in is the right word, but you came to kind of adapt a little bit on certain days. 
[00:32:00]  But certain days, you thought you were going to lose your mind.  Wow.  It's because you're coming from, I mean, from jail for anybody sucks, but coming from a place of being, you know, like Jay said, the no hitter, the world, all this great glory to come to this place.  You got to wonder, like, what the fuck was I thinking?  What happened?  Yeah, what happened?  Exactly.  You're exactly right.  And some days, to be honest with you guys, some days I will wake up and say, oh, this has got to be a dream.  I'm going to wake up in my bed.  It's got to be a dream.  Jesus.  And some days you say, how am I going to make it, not just, you know, 10 months, but how am I going to make it to the next day?  How am I going to make it, you know, like, I mean, you carry your food and sometimes you got some guys that if they want your food, they're going to take it. 
[00:32:30]  I mean, you got 10 guys.  There's nothing you can do.  I mean, as a gentleman I saw, I didn't literally see him get raped, but you're like about five feet from the shower and you hear him screaming for his life.  Oh, man.  And so you wanted to, am I next, you know, you don't know.  Is this a horrible way of living?  Did that guy look anything like me, the one who was being assaulted?  I imagine I'd be quite popular in that setting.  I'm certain of it.  It's a horrible situation.  Doc, what was it?  I felt that way during accounting meetings, you know, with my accountant and, you know, when Warner Brothers signs a contract. 
[00:33:00]  I felt that way.  I wasn't, you know.  Two different worlds.  Two different worlds.  That was great.  What was it in that time period?  Everybody, every athlete just got arrested in Tampa.  Like, Tampa was just where you went to get put in jail.  Whether every single athlete, you just see him coming out of Tampa jail.  Well, that makes perfect sense because that's a port of entry, right?  That Miami is where, you know, all the big parties start.  He says rape in the shower.  You say port of entry. 
[00:33:30]  I don't think he wants to hear that.  I don't.  This is kicking me out now.  I'm at Governor's Eleventown tonight.  Can you look back on those great moments, obviously, as an athlete and be able to put away the part that kind of taints that?  Because it seems like it would be such a waste to have such a great career, great memories professionally, but it's always got that nagging drug problem hanging over them.  You know, that's a great question because I was going to answer, but no, you weren't.  No, because what happened was so many times when I would relapse, so many times when I go on these binges, it was because I was guilty, depressed, and upset because I was thinking what my career should have been, what others thought my career should have been, more so than me thinking that. 
[00:34:00]  When you hear everybody say, oh, you should have been in the Hall of Fame or you should have won 300 games, I used to beat myself up with that a lot of times and started believing that.  Unfortunately, when I was in prison, the only good thing I can say came out of that was even though I got in trouble in 2010 when I came out of prison in 06, but when I was in prison, when you got nothing but time, I mean, nothing but time and you're not going anywhere, I had a chance to relive my life, replay the whole take, the good and bad and everything took place. 
[00:34:30]  And I came across the thing, I said, you know what, when I was a kid, I remember telling my dad who was watching the game, I said, my goal is to, I want to make the major leagues.  I want to stay healthy and play a long time.  I never thought about awards, never thought about the Hall of Fame, never thought about winning 300 games, Royal Series, you don't think about that thing.  I got to win every award possibly for a pitcher.  I got three Royal Series rings in New York. 
[00:35:00]  I was through the no-hitter for the Yankees.  I mean, so when I looked back on, I said, look, I can't beat myself up over this stuff anymore because of other expectations of me because when I was five years old, nobody thought this guy's going to be a Hall of Fame pitcher.  He's going to win through any games.  I got to really live a career that most players would dream of living.  So I had to eliminate that part because I found out also in rehab that by me beating myself over that, all I was doing was giving myself a reason to go back out and use.  So I had to eliminate all that and, like you say, start patting myself on the bike for the career that I did. 
[00:35:30]  Yeah, you could look at it.  I guess the prison will give you a ton of put things in perspective.  What did you use your time to do?  Because we started off talking about chess briefly there, and I know a lot of the fellows who work at the chess clubs downtown.  If you see a ton of forearm tattoos, watch out because he's been playing chess constantly for his entire stay.  Some guys read a lot.  Some folks get into the Bible.  What did you use your time doing in the joint?  Once I was there and I kind of accepted that I'm going to be here for 10 and a half months, I got into this thing where normally I was like, they had this track. 
[00:36:00]  I used to walk the track a lot.  I basically stayed to myself.  I didn't play any softball.  So occasionally I'll play horseshoe.  Oh, they must have been pissed.  Yeah.  You didn't sign for softball.  That's the movie.  Yeah, yeah.  You know what happened?  It had to cause problems.  He's going to play against the guards.  That's right.  You know what happened?  I had this guy kind of tell me when I was in a county jail before I got sent off to prison.  Kind of pre-warned me.  He goes, when you get to prison, stay by yourself because when you get there, they have sports.  They're going to already have you on a team. 
[00:36:30]  Oh, yeah.  And if you're on that team, the other team is going to be pissed.  Right.  And if you're on that team, you're not doing well, your team is going to be pissed.  Oh, fuck.  You don't want that.  And it's probably going to go past just the team and the game that's going to work its way into the actual life.  Well, 100%.  So when I got there, it was like, you're on our team.  I was like, well, I can't play.  My knee's bad.  Oh, good.  So I didn't want to know part of it.  So I played a lot of horseshoe.  Love Horshoe and basically just walked the track.  And that was basically all I did.  Yeah, staying in shape.  They're telling us we have to wrap with Doc.  He's very, very busy.  I want to plug the book. 
[00:37:00]  Yes.  It's called Doc.  Who said you got to wrap?  We're going to sell a million books for this guy.  Publicists.  That's what they told us.  This is the stop.  It's the publicist.  There's a publicist.  Darth Vader and Sons is knocking on the door.  He's making the rounds.  He's doing a round.  It's called Doc.  Doc Gooden doesn't want to leave.  His people are telling him he has to leave.  Yeah.  Right.  He's been beyond honest.  And I think he just sold a shitload of books because this looks like a great read.  It really does.  I'm serious. 
[00:37:30]  It's called Doc.  A memoir.  And what I've read of it is honestly, it's fantastic and it's honest and it's open and  you talk about everything.  And we interview a lot of athletes and most times I don't enjoy it because I don't find  them forthcoming.  And I'm saying in all honesty, you're my favorite athlete that we've interviewed.  Like you're fucking brutally honest about everything.  And it's like, that's all we asked for.  And it's like, this book is fucking great.  Definitely.  I really appreciate that.  It means a lot.  More awkward moments.  Can you turn your head and cough?  Epic fails.  That was a shitty joke that Bob. 
[00:38:00]  And fouled mouth rant.  Why don't you shut the fuck up?  Coming up, Opie and Anthony's Worst of 2013 continues next.  This is Opie and Anthony's Worst of 2013.  Worst of 2013.  Hello, everyone.  It is E-Rock.  That is me.  E-Rock Radio on Twitter, hosting the Worst of 2013 for the Opie and Anthony show.  We're looking back at this past year for all the cool things that happened, all the great 
[00:38:30]  guests that were in studio, all the amazing and bizarre scenarios that this show has gone  through.  This is Chip.  By this point now, I'm sure you all know who Chip Chipperson is.  He's a character of Jim Norton's.  And he has this ability to interject himself into almost every conversation that's being  discussed and not really contributing in the way that we had hoped.  A lot of you have been asking, oh, play the time that Chip said this or the time that 
[00:39:00]  Chip did that.  Well, you asked for it, and now your hell is about to begin as we look through a montage.  That's a callback there for you.  A montage of Chip segments.  Chip Chipperson is on the scene.  O&A's Worst of 2013.  Worst of 2013.  Oh, by the way, if Justin is listening, I think you should put in a word that Chip Chipperson  should make a guest appearance on the David Letterman program. 
[00:39:30]  Oh, really?  Yes.  I think Dave should not be made aware of who Chip is.  Oh, really?  Yeah, yeah.  Justin Stangler should be the guy to put in the word.  I think what you should do is you should go to Dave and you should go, look, Dave and  all the things that...  Trust me.  This guy is the goods.  He should use his entire relationship he's built up with Dave from...  And his brother.  ...until now.  Put his reputation on the line to vouch for Chip Chipperson.  And his brother.  Oh, and his brother.  Yeah, I'll just go right out there and go, like, hey, it's me. 
[00:40:00]  What's up, Dave?  Ladies and gentlemen, our next guest, Chip Chipperson.  And would it be a stand-up thing or just straight to the couch?  I don't know.  I'll just tell him when I get there what I feel like doing.  Oh, you wouldn't?  I'll be like, you better have your finger on that button because I might say fuck.  I'm going to open like that.  Really?  Yeah.  I'm going to sit right down next to him.  I'm going to sit down and go, like, what's up, Dave?  What are you doing, Chipper?  And I'll go, I hope you got your finger on that button because I might say fuck. 
[00:40:30]  And the audience will go, whoo!  The crowd will go nuts.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  You don't know what's going to happen.  This guy's crazy.  What would he interview you about?  Whatever he wanted.  How you doing, Chip?  Fucking good, Dave.  Meeting chicks.  Okay, why do you think America would be interested in seeing Chip Chipperson?  Just because they want to laugh and feel good?  There's nothing to talk to you about, though.  Yes, there is.  Just a boring, stupid man.  He'd be like, how's things going? 
[00:41:00]  I'd be like, if it was any better, I'd be embarrassed.  That is pretty funny.  It's like an old showper's answer.  You just try to have one-liners lined up for every question.  Yeah, how am I doing?  How are you doing?  And now Jay's leaving.  What's up?  What are you going to have, like, this show on a Tonight Show?  You want to just call it, like, the Dave Letterman Tonight Tomorrow show or something,  you know, and a place could clap for me.  Do they?  Yeah.  Never clap for that one.  No, no, I don't think they're clapping for that.  I'd say, hey, are you the only guy whose name isn't Jimmy now? 
[00:41:30]  You got Jimmy Fallon, Jimmy Kimmel.  What's this, like a Jimmy conspiracy or something?  And the crowd goes wild again.  Cheer and clap like motherfuckers.  And you make reference to them as being such, correct?  I didn't say that.  Motherfuckers.  I'd be like, yeah, you guys know what's up.  CIA.  Chip in action.  Chip in action.  Chip in action.  300 episodes, all written.  Ah.  Gonna show four new ones every Thursday.  You ready for the entertainment report?  That's terrible.  We're gonna show Entertainment Weekly a thing or two, right? 
[00:42:00]  Oh.  Yeah.  Each episode's two and a half hours.  No commercials.  Four a day?  Fuck yeah, four every week on Thursday.  Thursday.  Starting 7 a.m.  Oh.  It's 10 hours.  Oh, okay.  You went with this.  I mean, that's Entertainment Tonight.  Tonight.  That's fine.  All right.  It's just entertainment music shit.  What's the story?  I'll just riff.  Star of the office, John Krasinski, is to have a cameo on the new season of Arrested Development. 
[00:42:30]  So I hear.  It's a talk show.  It's not just, you know.  Yeah, it's gonna be a talk show.  Actually expand on that.  Catherine Zeta-Johns is back in treatment facility for bipolar disorder.  She previously sought treatment in 2011.  Our spies are telling us.  It's a full-form talk show. 
[00:43:00]  You gotta expand on the topics.  Discuss.  ABC is greenlit.  What?  Greenwood Envy?  A new reality show called Sing Your Face Off.  In which each week five celebrities will be transformed into legendary singers.  And perform as them.  According to sources who chose to be silent.  That's a rip-off of my show anyway.  I wrote that show.  I wrote a show.  It was called Dance Your Cunt Off. 
[00:43:30]  And I was putting it on the YouTubes.  Dance Your Cunt Off.  And I was showing footage of people who was doing all kinds of crazy dances.  And then someone said, Chipper, they have epilepsy.  Roddy from the Jersey Shore is in the hospital with kidney stones.  Ow.  Too bad he didn't eat Roland. 
[00:44:00]  Then he would have had Roland stones.  Good one.  I don't like that.  It's a little clever for Chip.  Fuck yeah.  Fuck yeah.  This is easy.  Yeah?  Fuck yeah.  Fucking Ronnie from Jersey Shore.  I wonder how he got that.  Probably from all the sand or something in his pizza.  Ah.  So you can put a little humor in.  Lighten up the hard news.  Very little.  That one was not clever for Chip.  The three surviving monkeys will be going on tour together this summer. 
[00:44:30]  Where's the fourth one?  Would he fucking fall out of a tree or something?  I don't know.  No.  He died.  He's dead.  He's Davy Jones.  He passed away.  What happened to him?  He passed away.  How are they going to do some of the Davy Jones songs?  Those are good ones.  You had a few hits.  Fuck yeah.  My mother loved the monkeys.  I get it.  With Two and a Half Men returns this season, Angus T. Jones will be only back as a recurring 
[00:45:00]  role at most.  Who is that?  He's the steak.  Angus T.  He's the guitarist for ACDC.  He's the kid that found God.  He had a problem with the show.  Yeah.  He found God.  Instead of Two and a Half Men, they're going to have to call two men and that fucking  guy who you see once in a while or something.  I don't know.  Change the name.  You got me.  You should, Chip.  That's good. 
[00:45:30]  Yeah.  What do I know?  Entertainment's easy.  Hey, the guy's going to be on Arrested Development from the office to Arrested Development.  I don't give a fuck.  Well, you got to make believe you give a fuck.  Big fucking deal.  Big fucking deal.  No, you got to kind of.  Hey, that crazy girl married to Michael Jones.  Whatever his name is.  Michael Douglas.  Michael Douglas.  She's in a hospital because she got bipolar.  How come she didn't steal it?  Oh.  Double disorders, cocksucker.  Well, this is working. 
[00:46:00]  I kind of like it.  I would listen to this more.  Fuck yeah.  Before I'd listen to Entertainment Weekly Radio.  Yeah.  She's as nutty as a fruitcake, my mother would say.  That's.  Oh, the pretty ones are always crazy, Chipper.  Get yourself a nice lady with ham hock ankles.  You want a lady who can carry the sofa up the stairs by herself.  That's practical.  Lamar always said that my mother had a lot of cushion.  What?  Lamar.  Hmm.  Is she fucking her? 
[00:46:30]  No.  Oh.  Bless you.  Don't sneeze in the middle of my entertainment report.  Sorry.  Sorry.  You already read all the stories.  ABK has greenlit a new reality show.  No, we did that one already.  Called Sing Your Face Off.  Now, what kind of celebrities are going to be on this?  Five celebrities are transformed into legendary singers and performers.  Fuck yeah.  So, what kind of celebrities do you think, Chipper?  Fucking, um, I would say the girl who played Joe on The Facts of Life.  Oh.  She's fucking famous. 
[00:47:00]  I've seen her in quite a while.  Yeah, Nancy McKeon.  That was her, yeah.  I know who it was.  Oh.  So, uh, her.  The lady who played Edna Garrett on The Facts of Life.  Well, they're not going to have two people from The Facts of Life.  Fuck yeah, they will.  They'll just start singing.  Well, who else then?  Go and play Blair on The Facts of Life.  No, let's see that.  It's not the singer.  She's a fucking great celebrity.  It's not people from The Facts of Life singing their face off.  Yeah.  And nobody knows that show anymore. 
[00:47:30]  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah, the fuck they do.  No, it's not really, Chip.  Well, you've still got two spots.  Yeah.  Yeah, who else?  Kim Fields.  Oh, Tootie.  What was she on?  She was the black girl from The Facts of Life.  Oh, okay.  My mother would always say, don't you ever come home with her, Chip, or you'll be sleeping  outside on a porch.  But she had Lamar.  Yeah, she was fucking black guys all the time.  No, she wasn't.  She was helping members of the community get back on their feet.  And who else?  Well, we got a fifth celebrity, yes.  Mindy Khan. 
[00:48:00]  Who's that?  Cohen, right?  I don't like to say that, because my mother didn't like the Jewy people.  She said, don't bring no Jewy kike burgers into this house, Chip.  Jesus.  I said, ma, that's not proper.  You can tell how Chip got so fucked up.  Yeah.  My mother said, if you want to see how many Jewish people are somewhere, you roll a penny.  She says, Chip, or they run after it and bang their heads.  My mother's a very wise, special woman.  Yeah, yeah.  But Mindy Cohen.  Okay.  She was Natalie from The Facts of Life.  So is it going to be a thief? 
[00:48:30]  She's very Rubenesque.  She looks like my mother, but she smiles more than my mother would.  So the celebrities are like thematic every week?  No.  They have a new show?  No, they're not.  So the second week, who would you say would be on?  Probably Jennifer Anburys from Friends.  Aniston?  Yeah.  And who else?  David Swinger? 
[00:49:00]  See, you're doing a thematic cast every week.  It's from a different show.  It's just fucking dancing.  No, they're singing the face off.  Oh, I forgot.  I was thinking of my show.  What's with your show?  Dance Your Cunt Off.  It's where you get a bunch of girls, and they got to do like a really hard country left and  right step until their cunt falls out. 
[00:49:30]  When your cunt falls out on the floor, you win a prize or something.  So it's all kinds of dances where their cunt could fall out, like river dancing, I guess.  Yeah.  Clogging.  Or the hard step like, yo, a one and two and three.  Right, country line dancing.  Yeah.  Not a soft shoe, though.  That wouldn't work.  I don't care what they got on their feet.  No, it's a type of dance.  Oh.  You're dancing your cunt off.  Dance your cunt off.  Chip, you're losing focus from the- 
[00:50:00]  I was going to put it on the fucking YouTubes.  Right.  You're losing focus from the entertainment show that you're supposed to-  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  That is entertaining.  The radio show.  Everybody would watch.  Who's cunt's going to fall off?  It's this.  It's this.  She's got a cute face, but wow.  Yeah.  That's just a turnip.  What?  Oh, well.  Oh, hi.  Just people walking by the studio.  Sorry.  Yeah, yeah.  We're distracted.  By a turnip.  All right.  So that's a good conversation about that new show, Sing Your Face Off. 
[00:50:30]  That's pretty good.  Any other stories you want to elaborate on?  You gave the headlines.  We're elaborating a little more now, Chippa.  Three surviving monkeys are going out on tour.  All right.  But there's not going to be no singing because the guy's dead, so they're just going to play  the music.  No, there are singers.  Yeah, they'll harmonize some shit.  Mickey Dolenz.  He's singing, right?  Mickey Dolenz is pretty much the lead singer in that band there.  Oh, all right.  But now, are they going to be getting ... Who was the one that never really ... Michael  Nesmith. 
[00:51:00]  Michael Nesmith.  He never really liked being with the monkeys.  No, he was doing that shit.  He had the whiteout fortune, but I guess since the computer, the whiteout fortune ...  Yeah, he needs a little money.  Chippa, what do you think?  That stock is dropped by now.  Chippa, what do you think?  I don't know, but I wouldn't mind going in there and fucking playing some sick fucking  puppies tunes.  This isn't the entity.  Talk about the story.  Jay, you're not supposed to be talking about you.  The Monkees going on tour, Mike Nesmith, Mickey Dolenz, Peter Tork, my fucking ... the 
[00:51:30]  new sick fucking puppy song, The Devil's Circus.  How does it go?  I heard ... How does it go?  I don't think you've heard this one yet.  Oh, I heard how it goes.  No, I don't think you've heard this one yet.  Oh, I did.  No, I don't think so.  How does it go?  How does it go?  First performance yesterday.  Yes.  It's a devil's circus.  You've lost focus completely. 
[00:52:00]  It's your demo.  Yeah.  You've lost focus altogether.  So, it's circus music played on a guitar with a lot of fucking distortion on it.  Fucking devil's circus.  But this isn't about sick fucking puppies.  I heard Two and a Half Men's coming back on.  Oh, right.  Now, Angus T. Jones, he had a problem with the show.  He got very religious and had a problem with some of the themes of the show.  He figured they were anti-  He has cancer.  No, he doesn't.  Now, you're just spreading rumors. 
[00:52:30]  No.  I just say stuff sometimes when I'm running out of shit to say.  Just got to keep talking.  Ran over the list of stories twice.  He was arrested for rape.  No, he wasn't.  He wasn't.  No, he wasn't.  Oh, he wasn't?  He wasn't at all.  That didn't happen.  He's just, I guess the-  Catherine Zeta-Jones is in prison.  No.  She ran over somebody with a bus.  She was backing up and she hit that cunt.  She's in the hospital for bipolar disorder, but it has nothing to do with-  She never hit anyone with a bus. 
[00:53:00]  Oh, my God.  She fucking bipolar.  She hit someone with an ax.  No.  That fucking bitch is crazy.  She was all fucking zooted on her medicine, running around, throwing soup on people, I heard.  No, that never happened.  Yeah.  She even threw fucking throat cancer at Michael Douglas and he ate it.  Jesus.  That's what happened.  He did have throat cancer, but he beat it.  It kind of makes sense.  He beat it, though.  I guess that's a way you could get it, yeah.  John Krasniewski fucking left Arrested Development.  He's going to start in the office now. 
[00:53:30]  No.  You got it backwards.  No, he's from the office.  Aren't you trying?  You got to try, Chip.  I am trying.  It's a big opportunity for you.  You got to try.  I am.  You can be the voice of the station.  Yeah.  The whole channel.  People like the music, though.  You let it play for a few minutes.  Minutes?  You can talk about Ronnie from the Jersey Shore.  He's got kidney stones.  And then maybe talk about some of the other Jersey Shore guys and what they are doing.  Yeah.  You ever see Snooki get fucking punched in the face? 
[00:54:00]  Yeah.  Years ago.  That was like the first season of five years ago.  Yeah.  They go through their laundry and shit.  No good.  Hey, I'm going to press my shirt or something.  What are you going out to get some fucking cooter?  Fucking fist pump.  I don't know.  I used to fist pump, too.  Did you?  Fuck, yeah.  And you got to watch the language.  This isn't a show.  They want it more.  They want it real.  I don't know.  No, no.  No, they don't.  It's more of a.  This is XL shit, you know.  You're going to be talking to a lot of women.  A lot of women are interested in.  I got a big fucking peck on, ladies. 
[00:54:30]  No, no, no.  How'd you like it stuck with a baby's fallout?  Third time running through the list of stories.  How'd you like me to fill your dunce hole?  No.  Chip.  No, Chip.  You can't curse.  I don't have to curse.  You got to stick to the stories.  And you got to elaborate on them.  Just don't read the headlines.  You have to be conversational. 
[00:55:00]  Okay.  So what's up?  What are you doing?  Do you know, I heard Catherine Zeta-Jones is back in treatment facility for bipolar disorder.  She previously saw treatment in 2011.  Well, what do you have on that, Chip?  She previously saw treatment in 2011.  And all of a sudden, now she's back in a treatment facility for bipolar disorder.  Catherine Zeta-Jones.  So anything you have that can maybe elaborate on this?  Yeah, she was already there.  2011.  That's two years ago. 
[00:55:30]  She was there, but now she got out.  Now she's back in there again.  And she's got bipolar disorder.  You're just rephrasing the statements in the headline.  You got to elaborate a little bit.  I am elaborating.  I don't think you are.  Give her a little extra.  Yeah, this is extra.  Maybe your personal opinion.  She's married to Michael Douglas.  Oh, there you go.  You're good, all right.  And she was in a place in 2011 for bipolar disorder.  And now she's back there.  What do you think of that?  What's that?  What do you think of that?  I think that it's been two years since she's been in a place for bipolar disorder. 
[00:56:00]  And she's gone back there.  We get it.  Catherine Zeta-Jones.  It's Zeta-Jones.  Yeah, she's in a treatment facility, by the way.  We know.  You've said that before.  A bipolar disorder.  Yes, a bipolar disorder.  You said it.  Yeah, Chip.  Yeah, but that's not the first time.  F no.  That's good.  You didn't curse, at least.  Yeah.  But even the F thing, you could leave that out.  Okay, heck no.  She was already there.  Okay, you could go there. 
[00:56:30]  2011.  You ever watch the entertainment shows?  That's all I do.  You ever watch, like, E.T., Entertainment Tonight?  That's a good movie.  Not E.T., the extra-terrestrial.  My mother would always go, if he went to the phone home so much, why does he go to a phone  booth, Chipper?  I said, I don't know, Ma.  Did you laugh at that?  Like a crazy motherfucker.  What about Billy Bush?  You've seen Billy Bush on TV.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Billy Bush?  What's he got, a bunch of berries on him or something?  Like a berry bush.  Yeah, it's like Billy Burr, except he's a shrub. 
[00:57:00]  It's a big red bush yelling at Philadelphia.  I don't think you should riff as much.  I'm good at riffing.  That's where my gift is.  I don't think it's your strong suit riffing.  My strong suit?  That's a shark skin one.  It's light blue in color.  Oof.  Oh, God.  What's up with Big Ball Guy or Big Balls Guy?  Does he have both balls?  Man has surgery for 134-pound scrotum?  He walks around.  Now, he's sitting on some type of bus here, a public bus, and he carries around a plastic 
[00:57:30]  milk crate, you know those milk crates, with a pillow, and he's got to sit on the chair,  and then in between his legs, he puts the milk crate upside down with the pillow on it  and rests his gigantic 134-pound ball bag on the milk crate and pillow.  Wow, that's a huge fucking ball.  He wasn't born this way.  What a burden.  It just started growing?  For five painful years, Wesley Warren Jr. watched as his scrotum slowly swelled into a 134-pound 
[00:58:00]  mass that hung to his ankles.  All right, get Dr. Steve on the phone.  Well, why the fuck wouldn't he stop when it was like...  Well, maybe it'll get better.  When it was like...  80 pounds.  It's like if the diameter of your ball bag increases by, like, an eighth of an inch,  how about you go to the doctor?  But there's a lot of wiring down there.  How do you take care of that?  He recalled a mid-sleep maneuver that slammed his right testicle.  I felt the most enormous amount of pain that one could possibly imagine.  And then it just starts growing from that point? 
[00:58:30]  The pain quickly subsided as if a big rig was rolling off his scrotum.  Right.  I felt like I dodged a bullet.  Oh, big rig.  The following day, the sack had stretched to the size of a soccer ball.  So, did he go...  Stop, he's not saying.  I went to the ER and they treated it as though I had some kind of infection.  Mm-hmm.  Antibiotics.  Went to other doctors.  No one was able to figure out anything for me.  Oh.  They would refer me to other doctors because I don't have insurance or the financial means  to pay for these folks on demand.  The appointment would be six weeks away or three months away. 
[00:59:00]  Blah, blah, blah.  Lives off disability.  You think?  Yeah.  And who's going to hire him?  He had help from...  Quite the distraction at the workplace.  Yeah.  Look at his ball bag.  Right.  Jesus.  Oh, Dr. Steve will be calling us to talk about big balls in five minutes.  Yeah.  All right.  Because he's dropping his children off.  Oh, okay.  I would have said to the guy, you're nuts.  That's pretty good, Chip.  I know.  Oh.  13-hour surgery.  So, what is he down to now? 
[00:59:30]  For what?  Like, what was...  To remove the 134-pound mass.  But what was the mass?  And how did he get it?  Just by rolling over in his sleep.  Nah, he rolled over in his sleep and it fucking...  That's when he realized he had something going on down there.  Something ruptured.  It's a kind of fluid collection.  Flood.  No, he already had something growing and when he maneuvered in bed, it exposed it to him.  Scrotal lymphedema?  What is it?  Lymphedema.  Lymphedema.  Scrotal lymphedema.  Scrotal lymphedema is what happens when your scrotum grows. 
[01:00:00]  Build up of fluid.  Fluid.  The mass and tissue.  Tissue.  It will knit itself into the fabric of your scrotum.  You know, those things you can't get on the show.  Tissue.  Tissue.  I don't even know you.  Yeah.  Hey, this is what you get when you wash your neck.  You get Kleenex.  Dr. Steve Chipperson.  Or something.  Fluids or something.  Jesus.  Yeah, it's a big mass or something. 
[01:00:30]  You know, a bunch of people in church inside of your scrotum or something.  You know, like Dr. Steve Chipperson?  No.  Who would?  Flod.  Yeah, a bunch of fluid.  I hate those stories.  You got to, like, grab your balls when you're hearing these stories.  I don't know why.  Grab yours.  Ow. 
[01:01:00]  I like that.  Yeah, bad.  His bag must have snowed.  Oh, my God.  Oh.  What?  What happened?  You know that feeling you get in your balls when you go in a car, like, and you're going  over a hill?  Or you're going downhill and then it goes uphill really quick?  Like it sinks back into you?  What is that?  I got to ask Dr. Steve that.  Why do you get a feeling in your ball bag when you go down a hill and then back up like that?  What is that?  Well, it's basically the, it's your sinking back and it's gravity kind of pulling you back 
[01:01:30]  towards the center of your own gravity, which would be where you're seated.  I don't buy that.  Yeah.  Because it's when you go up and over a hill or when you go down and up.  So you're getting the, the increase in G's and negative G's on your ball bag.  Doc, you don't have any H's or I's or something.  So, so, ah. 
[01:02:00]  So.  Yo, we got, I got a mustache.  Suss, that's when you have a bunch of mushers and you hide them somewhere.  Suss.  Suss.  We got a guy that had this in the eighth grade.  Oh, stop.  Jim in Philly.  Yeah, right here.  What do you got?  Big balls.  Yeah, it's called a particular torsion.  Oh.  And the same shit happened to me like in, it was like the summer of eighth grade and I  woke up one morning and. 
[01:02:30]  My balls do imitations.  It's testicular gorsion.  It's an old joke.  Yeah, it's funny though.  It feels like you get hit and the ball is like just all fucking day.  And then, yeah, it gets just minor to get like a softball.  I mean, I would definitely collect donations at that point.  But like, I got, I got at least like a softball.  Don't they also call that like a twisted yo-yo or something?  Yeah.  Like, like your ball, your, your testicles in your sack.  They are connected.  Obviously they don't just sit there like click clacks. 
[01:03:00]  They're connected with some fucking, you know, tubes and shit.  And, uh, and, uh, they, but they have to be, uh, able to drop down or suck back up.  Right.  So they, it actually is like a little yo-yo thing.  And that whole, that, that, that little array of stuff that holds your balls there, it could  sometimes twist and can kink like a hose, like a kinked hose.  That's exactly what they expect.  And that fucks up your, uh, your, your fucking balls.  And yours got up to the size of a softball. 
[01:03:30]  What do they do for you?  Well, it was, uh, the worst part was that my grandparents were ever watching me.  So I, I had to go to my fucking, you know, 80-year-old grandma and say, hey, you know,  like, I think something's wrong down there.  And, you know.  It was bit by a snake, grandma.  You got to suck the poison out.  Yeah.  Well, then why are you putting it in my ass?  To get it ready for your mouth.  Oh, that guy just calls in to help the show out.  And then he's fucking his grandma in the ass. 
[01:04:00]  And then the mouth.  He's doing ATM with his grandma.  Yes, and then the mouth.  A little ATM.  Great.  Exactly.  Pull those teeth out.  I guess, uh, I guess we don't care what happens to you.  But, uh, do you have normal balls now?  Well, I mean, that's the shitty part.  Because once that, you know, they expand to like a softball, I mean, like, you know, they  don't grow back to, it's like, it's like losing a lot of weight at once.  So you got, I got like, you know, you know, some wrinkles.  You got half a Hulk bag.  You got a lot of skin down there.  Say what?  You got a lot of skin down there. 
[01:04:30]  Yeah, yeah.  But like.  Like a deflated basketball or something.  There you go.  That fucking blows.  When someone says slap me five, give me some skin, right?  You just throw your balls or something.  That's that's that's that.  Dr. Jeff.  But they told you, they were like, they were like, if you had come to a funeral, you would  have lost, uh, you would have not been able to have kids and shit.  So, yeah.  They really fucking serious.  I love you.  All right, Jeff.  Thank you.  We got, we got the man himself online. 
[01:05:00]  That's us.  Dr. Steve, we got a story of a guy who's, uh, fucking balls or his scrotum, uh, got up  to 134 pounds and he said he, uh, moved in the middle of the night and fucking felt in  incredible pain.  I guess he, what, twisted the wrong way or something.  And that's what he's claiming caused this, which I doubt very much.  Yeah.  Yeah.  That's called massive scrotal edema.  What the fuck?  Well, a lot of times it'll happen when the, uh, uh, venous supply of the scrotum is blocked. 
[01:05:30]  So here's the thing.  The veins are, uh, very compressible, uh, uh, thin wall vessels, whereas arteries are  muscular and hard to compress.  So if you get, um, some compression of the vein, then the arteries can still pump blood  in.  Oh man.  Water fucking balloon.  Yeah.  It's a, it's just a, uh, you know, a hydrostatic situation where you've got water pumping in 
[01:06:00]  and it can't come out.  And so it just pumps these, uh, this scrotum, which is already, uh, pretty loose and elastic.  And it just gets bigger and bigger and bigger.  It will stop when the pressure pushing in equals the pressure pushing out.  But with the scrotum, that takes a long time.  It can get huge.  Oh my God.  So when they say they removed a mask though, is it just flood or is it, uh, probably stretching  the shit out of stuff in there, right? 
[01:06:30]  Yeah.  There's, uh, it's the, the testicles are still there, but they're, they don't grow there.  But inside that giant sack, there will be two, probably, uh, atrophic little testicles.  Atrophic.  Yeah.  You get that if you come in second place or something.  Dr. Chip.  I kind of like Dr. Chip.  Uh, but yeah, a lot of the tissue in there will become just sort of, uh, boggy and there 
[01:07:00]  won't, there might not necessarily be a lot of free fluid, although there, there may well  be, you know, and one that size, he's probably got a few gallons of, uh, as well as just tissue  that's, um, you know, boggy and enlarged swollen and, and fucking like, uh, impregnated  with fluid.  Yeah.  Oh, that's disgusting.  So how do you take care of this?  Surgery is the only, the only option on that. 
[01:07:30]  Compression will actually make.  Does everyone get soaked in the operating room?  Oh yeah.  Wait, compression will do what?  Compression will just make it worse.  Like people think, well, you got a swollen leg, you put them in a compression stocking,  but compress, uh, compressing, uh, swollen ball bag will actually make the, uh, the problem  worse.  So you can't jump up and down on it.  Yeah.  Sometimes people have cancer, uh, you get portion of the testicles will cause, uh, portion 
[01:08:00]  of the testicles where you twist the cord of the testicle so much that it cuts off the  blood supply.  Now that's a surgical emergency.  It usually doesn't cause a scrotum that's, you know, 14 pounds or 40 pounds or whatever.  You could probably lose a testicle that way if it's not receiving nourishment.  Absolutely.  Oh, Jesus.  This guy got it up to 134 pounds.  You chicks think it's fucking, your, your tits are a problem. 
[01:08:30]  Jesus Christ.  Got these fucking balls hanging down.  Imagine trying to walk around with that shit hanging between your legs.  Oh my God.  Yeah.  You have to bounce on them or something.  I really think I like this one.  So much foot.  So much foot.  So much foot.  So much foot. 
[01:09:00]  Dr. Steve, that's terrible.  You want to take, uh, ball bag questions right now?  Yeah, sure.  Because you're freaking out everybody.  We got a guy, Rocco in Jersey, he needs to talk to you immediately.  Dude, it's Rocco.  Rocco.  Rocco, what's up?  Um, Dr. Steve, 44, um, I got big sack of varicose veins.  I mean, I think for me, they're big.  And, you know, they hurt when someone touches them, like my wife touches them.  Maybe Chip could touch them. 
[01:09:30]  Um, anyway, what do you suggest?  Okay.  I missed that.  He's got a big ball sack full of varicose veins.  Oh, oh, oh, oh.  Okay.  Yeah.  If you read, a lot of people will have that.  Um, there are veins around the testicles that draw the heat away.  You may know that you can only make sperm if, uh, the testicles are three to six degrees  below body temperature.  And so there's like a, uh, a heat exchanger, which is, uh, you know, this plexus of veins 
[01:10:00]  around the testicle that draws heat away back up into the body.  And you can get varicose veins there just like you can anywhere else in the, in the, you  know, in the lower extremities.  Uh, and when you reach down there and feel, it'll feel like a bag of worms.  Uh, uh, just chance going fishing with them now.  That's awesome.  He went from like a chubby, bald, middle-aged looking guy to a girl with fancy hair. 
[01:10:30]  Wow.  That's...  And he almost pulls it off when you put the wig on him.  I know.  Oh, boy.  Well, he puts a lot of hair in his face.  A lot of hairs in his face.  Is that all he did?  He just dressed up like it?  Pretty much.  He has, it's not a surgery thing?  No.  He just likes to...  He just walks in, I'm done now.  And all the workers have to say, okay?  He likes to...  Yeah, yeah, that's the part about it that's fucked up.  Yeah.  All the workers just have to say, all right.  All right.  Whatever.  You know, there was one guy from sales that just went, I'm out.  I'm not fucking entertaining this guy's little whimsy. 
[01:11:00]  Raise his clipboard down.  I understand we're all supposed to have more tolerance these days, but this wasn't...  It's just rough.  It really rough.  If one of you guys walked in here and said, fucking chick, that would be rough.  That would be really weird.  That would be rough.  It's like you're daring management to say anything.  It's like...  Right.  Right?  Hey, look.  One guy says he doesn't like me as Don.  I take him to court.  I'm a rich man.  Oh, my God.  It's a win-win.  Uh-huh.  He walked into his Manhattan office on Friday in a little black dress and a 
[01:11:30]  brunette bobbed wig and announced to colleagues that from now on, he would like to be known  as Don.  I think everyone would openly just start laughing.  Like, I'll start laughing.  That's funny, Don.  That's great.  What a great joke.  You're a kidder.  Yeah.  Why would you...  Just change it completely.  Yeah.  You can pick any name.  My name was Bob, and now I'm Cheryl.  Right.  Like, it doesn't have to be, I'm Bob.  Now I'm Barbara.  Like, fucking Bobette.  You can fucking...  Believe me, you put on a wig and a dress and fucking stuff tits in there, you could go 
[01:12:00]  off with the name.  I'm not going to go, ew.  He didn't even keep a close name.  Yeah.  Don't worry.  The name's the easy part.  Went from Rob to Robin.  Yeah.  I was Rob.  You can pick any name.  Now I'm Roberta.  Oh, great.  It's actually easier if we don't...  If we're not reminded of the dude part of it.  Yeah, yeah.  Don.  You used to be Don.  Now you're Don.  Donna.  It's, yeah.  Donna.  It's like, fuck that.  It's asking a lot of people to just accept it.  I mean, you got to at least give us a... 
[01:12:30]  You got to give you...  All right.  You're shocked for a second.  And then we'll get you to do it.  Let me get it out.  Okay.  Now I'm with you, Carl.  Let me get out the laughter.  Yeah.  The shock.  The fucking, oh my God.  The jizz.  The quick...  Yeah, the calm...  The quick moment of, what the fuck are you?  Right.  Yeah, could you at least give us that?  Yeah.  And then we'll work on the inclusion.  The tolerance.  The tolerance.  The diversity.  All that happy or shit.  Some people saying things they shouldn't say.  Say, everybody, that lady has a pecker. 
[01:13:00]  Chippa.  Chippa would have so many lawsuits if he was in the workplace.  Will it work?  When Don walks in.  Mr. Chipperson, good to see you in my courtroom again.  What is it this time, counsel?  I just said, hey, that lady's not a real lady.  It's a guy with a bunch of stuff up in his shirt.  All right.  20,000 in damages.  You just look at a fucking scale on the wall.  Yeah. 
[01:13:30]  He argues with somebody who's transgendered at work.  Why don't you go look a bunch of peckers or something?  All right.  Here's a subpoena.  We'll see you in court.  See you next week.  Chipp just doesn't know what to do.  Fuck.  Look at that.  No way a faggot could lift that.  Exactly right.  All right.  Yeah.  There you go.  Hey, don't you wrist bend or something?  No.  What are you going to do?  Go home and smell some pecker juice?  Oh, my God.  No.  I didn't give the promotion to the black guy.  He's black. 
[01:14:00]  Oh, Chipp.  Exactly.  Why don't you eat some chicken or something?  Oh, no.  Oh, Chipp again.  Pulling up to the court building.  Yeah.  Hey, Chinese, look at your eyes.  Oh, no.  Jeez.  Welcome to the job or something.  And he just wouldn't learn.  Yeah.  There's no teaching.  Yeah.  What, are you going to go to the bathroom and look for your little pecker or something?  They do learning videos on chicks with snakes.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Pump up, pump up.  Nice ass.  Like, a lot of sexual harassment. 
[01:14:30]  Yeah, pretty girls.  Thinking that the girl would be, like, flattered.  Yeah.  Hey, look at your fucking nipples is showing.  You got me creaming in my pants.  Thinking it's a compliment.  Yeah, it's a compliment.  What's the matter?  I was complimenting.  I'd fucking cream all over your hand if you grabbed it.  You should get a raise, like, in the fucking front of my pants.  Holy shit.  Chip doesn't know.  He just doesn't know.  Back to human resources.  Yes, yes. 
[01:15:00]  HR again.  Sit down, Mr. Chipper.  Sticks his tongue out of girls.  I'll fucking make your clit dance.  Chip.  Chip, can we talk to you again?  Yeah, Chip.  What the fuck?  Don't make no sense.  How fast do you go through the easy?  Because I drove with Chip once at the airport.  Ah, yeah.  And he was explaining to me that, you know the spikes that they put so you don't reverse?  Yeah.  I love backing over those things.  Chip, every single time that we passed one of those, which was many times, he would explain 
[01:15:30]  to me that sometimes he likes to bag up over them just to hear the sound.  Yeah.  Ha, ha, ha.  Fucking tires.  Yeah, huh?  Yeah.  Right over.  So, so do you go through the easy pass fast then?  Fuck yeah.  Yeah.  Yup.  I put the fucking easy pass right up there.  I zip right through.  How fast?  Fucking 80.  80?  Yup.  Shroom. 
[01:16:00]  Wow.  Is that with the gate?  I fuck gates.  Sometimes I just hear a smack and people yelling behind me.  I keep going.  I don't give a fuck.  Tunes are cranking.  I got Loverboy playing.  Loverboy?  I don't give a fuck.  Jesus.  I've driven with Chip before.  He's not a good driver.  No, no.  He drove through Midtown very late at night, swerving in lanes and honking.  I couldn't imagine he'd be very good driving.  No, he's terrible.  Yeah, he tends to be aggressive at the wrong times.  Too slow at other times. 
[01:16:30]  Viral kitten video idea and then we'll give it a shot.  I'll be like, what are you looking for?  Some cat nap or something?  Catnip.  Yeah.  Oh, catnip or something?  Yeah, there you go.  You can take a catnap looking for catnip.  Uh-oh, don't kidnap the cat.  He's looking for catnip.  He's going to kidnap.  Catnap.  He's getting obsessive.  Fuck yeah.  Yeah, I'll just go nuts with the cat terms.  He really is.  Oh, boy.  I can't fly on catapult you while you're looking for a fucking catnap and taking a catnap.  Oh, with a cat thing, we get it, Chip. 
[01:17:00]  He needs to drop F-bomb.  Fuck yeah.  Fucking you guys podcast.  My fucking podcast is fucking amazing.  It's the fucking biggest one out there.  Yeah?  I have a podcast.  Fuck yeah, I do.  I haven't even seen it.  It's called Chipper Speaks.  Sounds ominous.  You know, the way Kevin Pollack does his talk and walk-in thing, Jim should have a podcast  where Chip interviews people.  I got one.  It's the fucking biggest.  My podcast.  It's fucking sold out. 
[01:17:30]  It's sold out.  My podcast is sold out.  What's that about?  How do you sell out a podcast?  Fuck yeah.  That's what they were saying.  Presented a real idea.  Then we're just back here.  You can't get it no more.  Sold the fuck out.  No more copies.  Sold out.  It's free and they're digital.  Eight million or something.  I got very good news.  What's that?  We haven't heard from them in many years.  Oh, who's that?  Curse man.  What?  Hello?  Peckers.  Hey, curse man. 
[01:18:00]  What's going on, curse man?  Farts.  Big shit.  Where you been?  Fuckers.  Where you been for 16 years, curse man?  Farts.  Assholes.  Uh, words that describe Opie and Anthony?  It's curse man.  Hey, curse man.  What's up?  Hey, big fucking peckers.  Where you been?  Huh?  Where you been for 16 years?  Um, farts. 
[01:18:30]  See, he's curse man.  He's just curses.  Big stinky fucking vaginas.  Big fucking dick would come all over him.  He's not even saying anything.  A asshole's with a bunch of fucking shit hanging out of him.  Yeah, yeah.  He's not, uh...  I'm cursing.  Oh, he's...  How did you hit me with the door?  Someone hit him with the door.  All right.  All right.  Well, good to hear from you again, curse man.  No, no.  No goodbye. 
[01:19:00]  No nothing.  Of course.  He does.  Oh, all right.  Yeah.  Yeah.  That's what I like.  Good looking girl.  She's good looking.  I like that.  Yeah.  Fuck.  Fuck yeah.  Oh, no.  What is that?  Oh, my God.  It's Chip Baca.  What?  Chip Baca.  Yeah, maybe it's...  The Wookiee.  Yeah. 
[01:19:30]  Millennium Falcon.  Why don't they call it, like, the Millennium Eagle?  Where did you create Chip Baca?  Just hours alone in my house doing that over and over again.  Television show or a joke to write or something?  No, just alone.  Hours you did that?  Dude, I just...  Hours.  I walked around just being Chip Baca all day in my fucking house.  Chip Baca.  To yourself.  Yeah.  Hans Solo.  How come he doesn't have friends?  Something. 
[01:20:00]  What the fuck?  Fucking Yoda.  Fucking Greenwood Envy.  Something.  That's horrible.  Jedi.  Should be a jet nose.  Oh.  Yeah.  I don't really like Chip Baca either.  No, I don't either.  Who shot first?  Oh, right.  Han or Greedo?  Yeah.  What's that?  Who shot first? 
[01:20:30]  Yeah.  Greedo.  How come he doesn't be happy with what he's got?  Something.  Chip Baca is going to be a sensation.  No, he's not.  You don't think so?  No.  I thought of it because I was talking to somebody at the Star Wars fucking Christmas special.  I watched a little bit of it.  Yeah.  Isn't that so utterly bad?  The fact that that got made is just atrocious.  Yeah.  How anybody shot that and thought it was good.  Yeah.  Wow.  Maud.  Well, I was starving for, you know, anything Star Wars related. 
[01:21:00]  Oh, God.  It was terrible.  So that's probably what went into it.  Mala and Lumpy and Itchy, the names.  Oh, they were terrible.  And then Jefferson Starship or something was-  I didn't watch the whole thing.  Was there and then-  Well, they were talking.  They were a big guy back then.  It was bad.  See, but this is now in line.  This was really hard to find for a really long time.  Oh, not yet.  Yes.  The Star Wars Holiday Show, 1978 on YouTube.  That one has no audio.  You got to get one with audio, Sam.  That one's got no audio.  Oh, there it is. 
[01:21:30]  No.  The audio was taken off.  Yeah, they took it off.  Why?  Because it was a copyright violation.  So you have to find little clips.  Find the one with the Spanish subtitles.  I was watching that one.  Wait, but they allow the video to stay up there, but not the audio?  I don't know how, yeah.  Oh.  Lumpy.  The announcer.  With special guest stars, Beatrice Arthur.  Beatrice.  Oh, is this embarrassing?  Oh, my God.  Is this fucking horrid?  Diane Carroll.  Oh. 
[01:22:00]  You think this is good?  This is embarrassing.  Starship.  Jefferson Starship.  You know, for Starship.  Right.  That's cool.  Harvey Korman.  Who thought this up?  Oh, how awful.  Animated Star Wars story on the Star Wars Holiday Special.  Oh, so awful.  Wow.  Life day.  Did they get back for a life day?  Right.  Oh, this is so bad.  You know, like when they zoom in on the Wookiee's house and for 10 minutes, there's no dialogue? 
[01:22:30]  Yes, they're just making noises.  They show Itchy and Mala and Lumpy playing in the house.  Nice music.  It's like a regular house.  Except they're shit sticking to their fur.  The rainbow connection.  Shit sticking to their fur.  The kids coming down with a fake plane.  This is it.  Them just making these noises.  Star Wars is like a massive movie and on a big movie set and everything.  This is not a shitty TV studio.  This is all about marketing, though.  That's why I hate George Lucas. 
[01:23:00]  It's just to sell stuff.  What are they saying, Chip Baca?  He's going, look at this plane.  How come it's not called a symbol?  And the old guy's going, get away from me, Chip Baca.  Go in your room or something.  I got to lay down with Lamar.  The worst is yet to come.  This is so fucked up, man.  This is ONA's worst of 2013.  On the O.P. Anthony channel. 
[01:23:30]  O.P. Anthony's worst of 2013 continues right now.  Yet now.  Sir Ben Kingsley, yes.  Sir Ben, hello.  I wanted to ask you, too.  Becoming Sir Ben, what is the process for that happening?  Is it something they tell you is going to happen and then it happens years later?  I had a letter from the Prime Minister's office maybe a month before it happened 
[01:24:00]  and then invited to the palace for the actual ceremony.  Do you know what it is that they say, okay, well, we would like to make Ben Kingsley Sir Ben Kingsley?  What happens before that?  You don't have any idea.  Oh, no.  It's a total surprise.  And in Britain, that's a tremendous honor.  But it's not something you can work towards.  You can't have that be a goal necessarily.  You have no idea.  If you just hit the national nerve somehow or the national psyche,  then England, which is not very openly enthusiastic like the States, it's quite guarded. 
[01:24:30]  So the counterbalance of that rather guarded aspect to your work is balanced by, you know,  the Prime Minister and the palace saying, we've seen you.  We like what you do very much, which is great.  Once you're recognized that way, does that change the way you just pick what projects you're going to do?  I have always picked my projects based on my opening years in the theater.  So I love good writing. 
[01:25:00]  I always pick good writing.  I hope to always pick good writing.  So that national embrace doesn't really affect my process in as much as it's always been rooted in another,  a great Englishman called Shakespeare.  I'm not pretending to be a great Englishman.  But that was my starting point.  His work's so beautiful.  Is that considered being knighted or no?  Is that being a sir is different than being knighted?  No, it's the same thing.  Oh, it is the same thing.  Okay.  I was going to say congratulations on being knighted, but I figured it would be wrong and I would look stupid.  Absolutely right.  Yeah. 
[01:25:30]  You've been in some of my favorite films.  I mean, I think one that people, like everybody knows Schindler's List,  but a lot of people don't talk about Searching for Bobby Fischer,  which is just, it's one of my, it's probably my top 10 or 12 favorite movies.  Ah, that's very interesting because Josh, with whom I was this morning, said that's one of his favorite films.  Josh Wayskin?  Yes.  You saw the real Josh Wayskin?  No, I'm sorry.  My interviewer this morning on a morning show said that as his child gets older, 
[01:26:00]  he's going to show his child the film because he said it's the greatest sports film he'd ever seen.  Yeah.  And that final battle between those two kids is extraordinary.  Yeah, and it's hard to make, because I love chess, it's really hard to make chess dramatic.  It's hard to build up, I mean, you know, Bobby Fischer pulled it off,  but it's really hard to make a movie where the climax is a chess match between two children.  Well, you mentioned the link.  The link is that Stephen Zalian, who wrote and directed Searching for Bobby Fischer, went on to write Schindler's List. 
[01:26:30]  So, you know, that brings us back to writing.  And then when it's beautifully written on the page, it's a joy to act and a joy to bring to life.  When you, because I find acting to be so difficult, when you see a role,  they send you the script for Bobby Fischer.  And now do you say, I'm going to learn these lines before I do them?  Or do you kind of like to just see them once, like I said, Brando would have like, you know, cue cards all over the place.  Or do you like to be completely off book and completely memorized? 
[01:27:00]  I love to be completely off book, because then you, you have some understanding of the sweep of the whole movie.  You have some understanding of, of the shading of every scene where it sits in the film,  because we don't always film in sequences, you know.  So I love to learn the whole thing.  And how do you, I would assume you must get very close to these characters that you play.  Since you, since you do them so well, how long do they stay with you after?  Like, so, you know, like, when does Gandhi leave you? 
[01:27:30]  Well, I'm, one of my tricks is to let go immediately.  The director says cut to let go totally so that the next time I do a take, it's a running jump again.  I never liked to be, I never liked to have the elastic halfway stretched.  Right.  It goes right back to its original shape.  And then on action again, I, it's the same process.  I go from almost from zero into the character.  So you're not one of these guys who's sitting there at lunch still in character. 
[01:28:00]  No, absolutely not.  No, I'm not.  I, I get back, I get back to me as often as I possibly can.  And as frequently as I can, then I hope that the result is that maybe the take is fresh every time rather than I'll give you a copy of a copy of a copy, which is a bit downhill.  Everyone, everyone works differently, but I'm not, uh, I don't quite know what the word method act means, but I'm not one anyway.  I'm sure you've worked with some though over the years and is it, is it odd to talk to a guy off, off, uh, well, you know, a cut and then again, you're having, you know, you're having a burger together and he's talking in characters. 
[01:28:30]  Christian Bale just remains Batman while he's on set.  And it's like, right.  Uh, well, as I say, you know, and I respect his work enormously that everyone has their own, uh, their own method of working.  Uh, I do remember one method actor who shall remain nameless.  And, um, he was so keen on being in character before a scene, um, banging around and kicking furniture and yelling that by the time he got on set, he was exhausted. 
[01:29:00]  And by the time the director said action, he forgotten all his lines.  Because he was so wrapped up in the character while we weren't filming, which doesn't matter.  No, it doesn't matter.  Was his performance good or, or did it suffer like, and then the final product, like, cause Brando, like, you know, I've heard he would read dialogue off people.  He would have a tape to their face, which you're like, that's horrible.  But because it played the way Brando did, he like, wow, what a brilliant move.  Oh, he was, I mean, his performances are absolutely magnificent. 
[01:29:30]  Beautiful.  Yeah.  So whatever he did was okay.  Although you could see where it would be degrading to his co-star who has to sit there like a prop with lines taped to his forehead.  Yeah, it's a little embarrassing.  Isn't there a party game where you stick a word to your head or, uh, that you don't know what it is and you've got to guess the word that's stuck onto your head?  Yeah.  Yeah, that sounds like what, that's what I heard he would do to certain, uh, certain guys who could get away with it.  So I guess it all depends on how the final product comes out, whether somebody was a genius or whether they were just kind of irritating and eccentric.  Right.  Of course, of course.  And Brando was a genius. 
[01:30:00]  Absolutely.  Yeah.  So Iron Man 3.  Yeah.  Is when you go into a summer blockbuster movie, you know, going in, this is what the goal is.  Is that very different from, uh, something like Bobby Fischer?  Not with this particular franchise, because what's, what's so beautiful and contagious about this franchise and what everybody loves about it is that although, of course, it's called Iron Man and it's about massively powerful exteriors.  What they do explore is the vulnerable man inside. 
[01:30:30]  And that's where Robert Downey Jr. is terrific.  He's vulnerable to friendship.  He's vulnerable to comradeship.  He's vulnerable to loss.  He's vulnerable to self-doubt.  He's vulnerable to panic attacks.  He's vulnerable to love because he's in an intimate relationship with Pepper, who's magnificently played.  So, uh, I think that that sets, that style sets it in a, in a genre almost of its own.  And therefore brings me back to the writing.  I just, I'm, I jump in just on the same level.  Is that more difficult to kind of humanize a character? 
[01:31:00]  That's obviously, it could be so silly, like it's a superhero, but you have to relate it to an audience.  That's like, okay, I believe this.  I think it's, I think it's a bit of a tightrope.  I think that it's all a question of taste and rhythm and how you construct the arc of the character.  Uh, I think that the way, uh, the way those moments are offered to the camera and the way it's edited, I think the rhythm of these films is beautiful because after every magnificent action sequence that you have, it's immediately followed by a moment of vulnerability or tenderness or absurdity. 
[01:31:30]  But there's always that wonderful rhythm where they pull you, they pull the audience in with magnificent action.  And then they, there's something beautiful happens.  Something very human happens.  It's very clever rhythm.  And did you want to see the script before you agreed to, to, to do the film or the writing is so important to you?  I was visited by Kevin Feige before I had the script and taught me through the arc of the character in the film, which I, I loved what he had to say. 
[01:32:00]  And then they sent me a script and then Shane Black welcomed me onto the set.  And I, I felt like a team player within seconds.  They're a very, very welcoming group of people to work with.  What do you want?  Is this the type of movie that you would watch?  What do you watch for your own entertainment?  I have watched all of this particular franchise, the, the, the Marvel franchise, and I absolutely love it.  You started to, I just to jump back in your career a bit, because it's very interesting. 
[01:32:30]  I read that, uh, Brian Epstein, uh, you know, the Beatles manager, uh, is kind of how you, how you got started.  And, uh, can you just talk about that for a second?  Cause you don't hear many, many people with Beatles connections.  I, I, I was in a show, uh, a play on stage in London that was produced by Brian Epstein.  He backed it.  He put the money into it.  He was the producer.  And my role in this play was a kind of musical chorus.  I would come on during the play and sing a song about what the hero was going through and what he was about to go through. 
[01:33:00]  It was a lovely device that, that kept the play running smoothly.  And Brian, of course, on the opening night, got two of his mates in Ringo Starr and John Lennon.  And, um, uh, I met them after the show.  Are those guys actors?  I've not heard of them.  I, I, I met them after the show and they were very sweet about my music.  Um, and it was, you know, a total ripoff of their songs and Bob Dylan. 
[01:33:30]  So total ripoff.  Just sang with an English accent.  That's all, you know, I got away with it.  And I then, I met Dick James, who was the recording manager of, of the, of the, of the Fab Four at the time.  And he, indeed, to my astonishment, offered me a recording contract and said that he would like to mold me.  Mold, I would like to mold you.  He said, I'm going to mold you, make you a rock star.  And I ran out of his office and became an actor. 
[01:34:00]  Do you ever look back on that and say, wow, maybe I could have given that a shot?  You know what?  If I do have a musical ear, and I think I do, it's so much now absorbed into the tone I use as an actor, the rhythm of the language I use as an act.  Sexy Beast is a kind of musical performance because it's entirely based on rhythm and tone.  And so I do use my musical ear in, in my, in my acting.  So I don't really have any regrets.  I probably would be, you know, dead in a pool of drugs, blood, and alcohol. 
[01:34:30]  Yeah.  Had I become a rock star.  Yeah, you had to do something much more stable, like acting.  Yeah, it's much, you know.  Well, they're telling us in our ear that you have to leave because you have promotion.  But you've already won a Grammy.  You've won an Oscar.  I mean, it's, it's not like you haven't done a tremendous amount.  And, uh, Sir Ben Kingsley, uh, thank you.  It was tremendous to have you here.  Great pleasure.  The worst is yet to come.  This is ONA's worst of 2013.  2013.  On the Opie and Anthony channel. 
[01:35:00]  Yeah, this is Opie and Anthony's worst of 2013.  Hello, my name is E-Rock.  It's the worst of 2013 for the Opie and Anthony show.  And, uh, we're up to the Paul Anka saga.  Now, Paul came on the show, uh, had a great time, you know, in and out.  And we didn't think too much of it after Paul left.  But then, you know, a couple of days later, Paul sent this amazing gift to Opie to thank him for having him on the show.  Paul Anka is quite a legend in the music industry. 
[01:35:30]  This guy doesn't have to think twice about us.  We don't mean shit in the whole scheme of the life of Paul Anka.  But he sent a very nice gift.  And this was greatly appreciated.  Until we found out he sent this gift to somebody else.  This is ONA's worst of 2013.  On the Opie and Anthony channel.  I got a package here.  Yes, you do.  Sam.  Jesus, Sam.  Sorry.  Attack.  That's not what we're talking about.  Jesus, you're better than this.  My gosh.  I don't know.  Look at that thing. 
[01:36:00]  E-Rock brought in a big box.  It was a little gift.  And it was, uh, for me.  Oh.  Who's it from?  E-Rock?  Well, I'm going to open it up on the air.  Is that from you, E-Rock?  No.  Me and E-Rock kind of know who it's from.  But, you know, for the magic of radio, I'm going to do this cold.  This is going to be good.  So, I've got a big box.  Look at these packages.  They're beautiful.  And the package came from Beverly Hills.  Whoa!  From one of the housewives.  With a little note. 
[01:36:30]  Hmm.  It's like a very, like, silvery package.  The wrapping paper's silver.  It's a very well-to-do ribbon wrapped around it.  Yeah, beautiful, uh...  Like the type of ribbon you save.  It's fabric.  I guess I could fucking take a picture of this.  Take an Instagram before and then after.  And then maybe get one of those split screens going on that everybody loves so much.  Wait, I'll pull out the card.  Yeah.  That's what I'll do.  I'll pull out the card.  I'll put that up there.  Well, who's the card from?  Well, they'll know online before you. 
[01:37:00]  Why wouldn't you just share it with the radio first?  Huh?  So you have to tune in online to figure out what the big mystery is?  Yeah, Twitter's way more important than the fucking radio show.  Everyone knows that by now.  I'm struggling with it.  With what?  That fact.  Why?  You don't have numbers?  I got okay numbers on Twitter.  I'm doing pretty well.  I'm approaching 50,000.  Whoa, that's pretty good, man.  It's not about the numbers.  God damn it.  I keep getting everything wrong.  You think I could...  All right, they'll be able to see what this is. 
[01:37:30]  All right, so I open up the note, and it says, Dear Greg...  Did you spell Greg right?  Yes, yes, which is creepy.  Because I'm a rarity.  I'm a G-R-E-G-G.  Yeah, I know.  Me and, I think, Greg...  Greg Allman?  I think Greg Allman does it that way, and that's about it.  It says, Dear Greg, what a great way to start the morning.  I really loved it, and look forward to the next time. 
[01:38:00]  Okay.  With much respect.  It was a guest on the show, obviously.  Who sent a package, a really nice present.  But just to you?  I don't know.  Maybe one's waiting for Anthony.  I don't know.  Are there any more packages?  Oh, you know what?  I know why Anthony doesn't get one of these.  Because he was late.  He wasn't here that day.  Oh.  So this very famous person who sent a really nice gift because he was on our radio show  that day, Anthony, was not here.  It's a very famous person. 
[01:38:30]  Very famous, yes.  I don't think we'll become, like, celebrity friends or anything, unfortunately.  I'm assuming it's from Kevin Pollack.  Kevin Pollack?  Yeah, just because he's the only famous person who listens to the show.  I love Kevin Pollack, but I can't imagine him actually sending a gift.  Just sending a gift, yeah.  Now he's going to, because now he's going to feel guilty.  Kevin Pollack?  Yeah, I think Kevin Pollack should send a gift.  Uh, no, it's not Kevin Pollack.  Hmm.  This is interesting.  Dr. Steve. 
[01:39:00]  E-Rock knows, so he's out.  Travis, you want to guess?  A very famous guest.  Was it the first time he was on?  Yes.  Okay.  Oh, it was the first time he was on?  Mm-hmm.  What the fuck's he sending gifts for?  I don't know.  Will he be back?  Yeah, he sent a gift.  Yeah, but that doesn't mean that he'll be back.  Oh, yeah, this person will be back, yes.  Okay.  This is a recent guest?  It's Guy Fieri.  He sent me steak knives.  Is it Guy Fieri?  No!  Because I was about to say, that is very desperate.  It's Guy Fieri. 
[01:39:30]  Yeah.  Um, Travis, you got a guess on the big gift?  I'm going to guess Paul Anka, but I think Anthony was here for that interview.  Anthony was not here for the Paul Anka interview.  Then I'm going to guess Paul Anka.  And you would be correct, sir.  Yes!  Why is Paul Anka sending you gifts?  He's Paul Anka.  So once again, dear Greg, what a great way to start the morning.  I really loved it.  And look forward to the next time with much respect.  And that next time is next week.  Yes.  What?  I don't know what's going on with Paul Anka. 
[01:40:00]  He really had a good time.  Why the fuck is Paul Anka coming back?  He was just here.  I know.  I don't know.  He's a great time.  Because when Roland said it, he goes, I go, why is Paul Anka coming back so soon?  He goes, he really had a good time.  He's been in the business for 70 years.  Yeah.  And he hung out with Frank Sinatra.  And he now wants to hang out with Opie and Anthony.  And Jim Norton.  How does it make you feel?  You've been talking all week about not having celebrity friends.  Now Paul Anka is all on your nuts.  Imagine, fast forward a couple more weeks, I can't get rid of Paul Anka. 
[01:40:30]  Paul Anka.  And this becomes really creepy.  He thinks you, Ant, and Jim are the new Rat Pack.  I know.  What a drop off.  Yeah.  What is he doing?  He used to hang out with Sammy and Dean and Frank.  And now it's Opie and Anthony and Jim.  Does that mean he just sits at home now?  Are all his celebrity friends like dead?  So he's trying to make new ones?  I don't know, man.  I think it's really cool, but it's a little strange.  You'd think he could hang out with musicians.  Like, he'd still be in the scene.  Right.  Do you know what's in the box? 
[01:41:00]  I do not.  I'm thinking it could be the cologne.  That's what I would guess.  I would guess a severed head.  So Jim didn't get a gift?  You know what?  I mean, not to spoil it, but I think he did send Jimmy the cologne.  Oh.  So I'm assuming this is my cologne that he promised me as well.  That is quite a big...  He sent you a giant bottle of cologne.  It's like two liters.  Yeah.  What is it?  It's called Cove?  Cove Collection?  Cove, probably.  Oh, yeah.  Cove. 
[01:41:30]  I don't know why Cove would be your first guess.  It's called C-O-V-E.  I'm going to figure out how to read eventually.  You just wait.  Yeah, it's a giant...  Of course it's Cove.  I don't know why I just said Cove.  It's a giant bottle of Cove cologne.  The box is probably nine inches tall.  It's really heavy.  Like, this is ridiculous.  I'm not bringing this home.  It's a giant crystal bottle.  You shouldn't say on the air you're not bringing it home.  No, I'll bring it home, because, you know...  It's Polenka.  He's coming back anyway. 
[01:42:00]  He can say whatever we want.  What the fuck?  Look at this thing.  It's like really nice crystal.  Look at this shit.  That's just the top.  Look at this.  The top of the bottle is wrapped separately in like a protective wrap to make sure it doesn't get ruined.  And then there's another fucking package here.  Oh, my God.  This is just the empty container.  It's just...  He sent you just a crystal bottle to put your Cove in.  Right.  I'm going to have to do a before and after. 
[01:42:30]  I got the gifts unwrapped, and then I'll have a picture of them wrapped as well.  So that's the cologne, I guess, in the other box.  What the fuck?  And what?  You got to now pour the cologne into the canter?  Wait, no.  That's not cologne.  What?  He sent you like a bottle and glasses.  Like that's for putting whiskey in.  Wait, I don't get fucking cologne?  No, he sent you like a...  Maybe that's why he's coming back.  He's going to hand deliver it to you.  These are very nice, though. 
[01:43:00]  I'm looking online.  It's a very nice gift.  That's like in Mad Men when they had the cart with the drinks.  I got a Cove crystal decanter.  Look this shit up.  Maybe we can resell it.  All right.  Let me check it out.  It's about $100 right there.  And then, okay, I get it.  And then really nice crystal glasses.  Yeah, it's a drinking set.  Dude, this is a really, really nice gift.  We should save them.  I'm going to a wedding soon.  This is going to be perfect.  Yeah, wrap that shit back up.  I'm going to wrap this shit.  This is like a perfect wedding gift. 
[01:43:30]  Why did he send you that?  It's Paul Anka.  I don't really drink.  That's the problem.  See, you know why this is a risk when celebrities do it?  What do you put in this decanter?  It's not like a wine decanter.  I think whiskey.  Juice.  Like whiskey or gin.  Yeah.  Maybe a nice vodka.  But now, when Paul Anka was first coming in, the idea was, holy shit, Paul Anka's in studio with us.  Now, it's like, what's Paul Anka doing? 
[01:44:00]  Why is he giving me gifts?  Yeah, does this make you feel like you think less of him, right?  It completely strips away his famous guy, Mystique.  Right.  I don't think Elvis was walking around giving gifts out like this.  Or they'd be weird.  To, like, radio nobody.  Yeah, exactly.  He wasn't sending disc jockeys decanters.  Holy fuck.  It's like, geez, Paul, relax.  Yeah, we'll have you back on.  It was a book interview.  Dude, I want to break this so bad.  I'm getting that urge.  How funny would it be if Paul Anka came back in and you could pretend it was a mistake, 
[01:44:30]  but you could announce you're going to do it.  Yeah.  And say, like, oh, you gave me this great cove decanter and then you dropped it and shattered  it in front of his face.  That is fucking really nice.  Now it's going to be awkward.  I got to thank him and stuff when he comes in here.  Holy shit.  Now you're going to have to get him a gift.  He's coming in next week.  Yeah, but I wanted the cologne.  That's all I wanted.  The decanter is $100.  Really?  Yes.  Taillights, taillights, taillights.  Break, break, break.  Yeah.  The traffic at a little later. 
[01:45:00]  It's fucking astounding.  Horrendous, right?  Astounding.  Yo, if I don't get another cup of coffee, I'm going to flip some shit.  Uh-oh.  Get the boss some coffee.  I'm going to throw some fucking crystal.  I don't know if they're...  The guys get coffee.  They'll make a fucking maniac out of me.  He's coming back.  He's coming back.  Why?  He had that good a time.  If you remember, I missed that appearance.  Yes, you did.  I was ill-fated at the time.  We did all right, man, with Paul Anka.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  We did all right. 
[01:45:30]  But now...  We had a good time.  It's all a hat to you.  You guys are pals.  Right.  And now I'm going to be the guy that's like, holy shit, it's Paul Anka.  Right.  And if you play it right, you might have some fucking crystal in your future.  I know.  I see that.  I just want a cologne, though.  You just want a cologne.  It was a throwaway.  Me and Jimmy go, wow, you smell really good.  Me and Jimmy, we're on the same page with colognes.  Yeah.  And we love collecting the celebrity colognes that come in here.  Sure.  And we got something from D.L. Hughley. 
[01:46:00]  Mm-hmm.  And then who came in here smelling really good?  And Jimmy went out and got the cologne.  Ozzy.  No, someone actually gave...  Oh, left the cologne here.  Was it Sutherland?  Was it Donald Sutherland?  Right.  And actually said, well, it's this cologne, and just gave Jimmy the rest of the bottle.  But then asked for it back later.  Did he come back for it?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  And then he wanted it back.  He kind of wanted it back.  And then I guess Paul Anka sent Jim Norton his actual cologne.  Oh, he did.  Or the cologne he uses.  So I was assuming it was my cologne, finally. 
[01:46:30]  But no, I get the crystal.  This is like one of these must-be-here-to-win-prize things.  I don't get the prize.  He's probably bringing the cologne with him on the second trip for you.  Oh, maybe.  I sure hope so.  He sent it to Jim already.  That would be wonderful.  What is he promoting?  Nothing.  No way.  Friendship.  There's no way he's just coming back.  He just came out with a book like two weeks ago when he was in here.  Yeah.  What could he possibly be promoting?  The book again?  Yeah, maybe he's saying you could still buy the book.  Right.  I mean, I have no, you know.  You should go back and listen to the interview. 
[01:47:00]  I'm sure he had a great time.  Right.  You should go back and listen to the interview.  Yeah.  And then ask the exact same question.  Oh, my God.  I probably wouldn't even have to listen to the interview.  It would just be what I felt, you know, I would ask, too.  We're usually on the same fucking circuitry here.  Yeah, what?  Tonight Show theme.  Fucking the guys get shirts.  The guys get shirts.  Don't make a fucking maniac out of me.  You talk about that.  My did it my way.  The Rat Pack.  You did it all, brother.  Yeah.  So I don't even know why he's coming back.  So what the fuck are we going to talk about?  Talk about that heavy metal album he put out. 
[01:47:30]  Oh, yeah?  I want him to maybe sing a song for us.  Would our audience appreciate that?  I don't even know.  They'd have to.  We would.  But it's classic.  Yeah.  Tell him he's got a before.  But would he do that?  Okay.  How would we do it?  He doesn't have his band.  He could play the track.  He doesn't do karaoke.  How about we?  It's Paul fucking Anka.  Yo, where's my coffee?  Holy shit.  Whoa.  I'm on a sway boss.  Yeah.  Sway boss.  You would make a good crony.  Yeah?  He'd be a good crony.  So why don't we sing with Paul Anka? 
[01:48:00]  Well, he's not a flunky.  He's a crony or a henchman.  Oh, no.  Yeah.  He could be a henchman.  That dude doesn't fuck around.  No fucking way.  I know.  Our security guy.  Well, fuck that.  I want to talk about Paul Anka.  Paul Anka.  Could we sing with Paul Anka?  Dude, that would be a dream come true for me.  I would break out the golden voice for Paul Anka.  You would?  People have been waiting for it.  All right.  Regrets.  I had a few.  You've got to harmonize a little more.  And again, too few to mention.  Or I would have to know all the words. 
[01:48:30]  That's true.  Could you write all the words down?  Could you do a little studying?  You could just go.  You know, you could do that.  Yeah.  Sing that part.  What a weird hour.  It was weird.  This is a weird hour.  It was very strange.  It was weird.  We got a clip from Mr. Imus' show.  Oh, Mr. Imus.  Now.  What does Mr. Imus say?  You're laughing, right? 
[01:49:00]  I know.  I don't know what it is.  Well, for one lousy fucking day, I thought I was special.  One lousy fucking day.  Oh, no.  One lousy day, the Opster thought he was special.  I think I can guess what it is.  Turns out, oh boy, I'm not special at all.  Not even close.  It's this, not cards.  What?  Shut up.  Why don't we just play the clip? 
[01:49:30]  Please.  Okay.  Just keep that in mind.  For a day, I thought I was special.  So I got back to the office here in New York.  First time I went in the office was, I think, on Monday.  And there's a gift.  Oh, boy.  What's going on with Imus?  We haven't heard him in a while.  It gets worse.  Really?  I went by to the office.  There's a gift.  He needs air.  It's like he's, yeah. 
[01:50:00]  Oh, fuck.  Come on, Don.  A gift from Paul Anka.  Oh.  Who was a guest on a program with his book.  Huh.  From a place called Geary's in Beverly Hills.  Paul, this devoted fan, who listens to me religiously, sent me a brandy decanter.  And also said, give my regards to Charles. 
[01:50:30]  And a set of four double old fashions.  I just got the exact same fucking gift as me.  It's the exact same gift.  So there was no thought in it.  It's the same thing.  It's the exact same fucking thing.  He got a bunch of these.  Which you would have got, too, but you weren't here that day.  And he had them sent out to all the places that he's been pushing his book.  What an idiot I am.  Do you think the note's handwritten or someone writes it for him? 
[01:51:00]  I'm betting that's his secretary.  All right.  Or for a copy machine.  I'm bringing the decanter in tomorrow.  I'm fucking giving it away.  Fuck Paul Anka.  Why would you give it away when you could smash it?  That's so hack.  You know what?  That's what somebody else wanted to do.  But it's hack.  It's hack now.  When there's no reason to.  You have a reason now.  I really thought I got a special gift from Paul Anka with a handwritten note.  And it turns out he gave these things out all over the place.  Why don't we analyze it?  Huh?  Do you want us to call Imus and see if you guys can talk about your gifts? 
[01:51:30]  Sure.  What did he do wrong when you think about it?  He just gave two gifts to people.  You guys aren't dating him.  It's the exact same gift.  Who cares?  He didn't buy you the same roses he bought Imus.  That's the same fucking gift.  And he probably got a whole bunch of them for other people that we don't even know about yet.  Yeah.  I don't feel special.  I want to feel special for one fucking day.  And a set of four double old fashions. 
[01:52:00]  And know what's sad?  He's laughing at the gift.  He's laughing at the gift.  I felt like fucking good.  Yeah.  He's laughing at the gift.  He's laughing at the gift thinking it's completely ridiculous.  I didn't think it was ridiculous when I opened mine.  Fuck yeah, man.  I laughed at mine too.  I felt great.  My cologne.  You got cologne.  I did.  Do you think maybe like fucking McGurk got some cologne?  No.  No?  No.  Why would you give McGurk cologne?  He fucking sits in that weird little area like a fucking creature. 
[01:52:30]  Absolutely.  No, because we asked about it.  Didn't we?  We both asked for his cologne.  You got the cologne.  I didn't get the cologne.  I put everyone's name in the email.  This is who was in the studio that day.  And blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.  The only reason I gave my address was because I was afraid if it went through corporate here,  they would open it or something would fucking happen to it.  Yeah.  So he only sent one cologne to you?  Yeah.  Jesus.  And then, the next day, I get something for Kevin Pollack.  Kevin Pollack sent me a gift too. 
[01:53:00]  That's a good arm of his hand.  Fuck, man.  Oh, he's fucking wheezing, though.  You got to change your Imus impression again.  It's like every month or so, you got to change it a little.  What was he going through?  What kind of cancer did he have?  He had the prostate, right?  Oh, prostate.  Okay.  You think that's from the chemo or no?  Something's going on.  No, I...  Last time...  Is he over it?  Look, man.  I think we said it already, so fuck it.  Last time I talked to Imus off the air, he said he wasn't fucking going through the traditional treatment. 
[01:53:30]  Oh, okay.  He said he was just going to ride it out.  Yeah.  Didn't he say that?  I think you were there for that one, right?  Wow.  I'm sorry, I'll say that.  Maybe he changed his mind.  I don't know.  Yeah, because that's such a fucking...  That's what Steve Jobs did.  He went the natural route like an idiot, and he fucking...  He should be alive today.  He absolutely could have beaten that cancer.  Great.  But no Coke spoon?  Yeah, exactly right.  So I was going to bring it in and smash it with a sledgehammer, but my wife wouldn't let 
[01:54:00]  me be because...  Well, let me.  Because I'm pussy whipped.  Do you know how funny it would be to see Imus smashing somebody with a sledgehammer on Fox Business?  He wouldn't be able to lift it up over his shoulder.  How is he going to smash it?  He's just a jerk.  He is a jerk.  Why'd he want to smash it?  Yeah, look, there's a different reaction.  I felt like a million bucks that day, and he right away knew it was a stupid fucking gift. 
[01:54:30]  Did he have a bad appearance on Imus?  No, but later on in the clip, you'll hear it.  All right, let's keep going.  He knew he...  Well, let me.  She pointed out how dangerous it would be to smash a crystal decanter and four cheesy glasses  with flying glass all over the studio, and she's right.  So letting that do it.  That is pretty funny.  That is pretty funny.  No, you should take him to the ranch and, like, use him for target practice, like, shoot 
[01:55:00]  a pistol at him.  That would be fun.  God, what a great idea.  Oh, man, that would be awesome.  The value of me, because I looked it up.  Wow, he might really be my father.  This is exactly what you did.  He jokes about this, has over the years.  He might actually be my father.  He does the same shit.  Wow.  After this.  Huh?  He does another thing that you do.  Really?  Oh, my God.  This is so funny.  This is weird.  I love it.  That's why I pulled so much of it. 
[01:55:30]  Yeah.  Because I looked it up, or I'm begging it.  It was $1,000, which would have been worth, you know, say $1,000, which would have been  appropriate.  But a cheesy, cheap, crumming crystal that kind of, for $160 is not exactly what I had  in mind.  But it does establish a precedent. 
[01:56:00]  Yeah.  And that is, if you have a book, and you're appearing on the program, let's pony up a gift  for the iMac.  Wow.  But maybe it's something I might be able to use.  Way to go, Dad.  Way to go.  Oh, fuck yeah.  Holy shit.  A cheesy gift.  I wish $1,000 should be appropriate.  Which would have been appropriate.  It makes me laugh.  Oh, that's hilarious.  Fuck.  Fuck.  That gift is useless.  Yep.  It's taking up space in my getting smaller apartment. 
[01:56:30]  It's like spam, his gift.  That's what you got.  You got something that he gave no thought to.  Sent it out to everybody that he's done an appearance on.  I want to find out if there's anyone else.  You think like Scott Shannon has one?  He was on the show.  Yeah.  And did they get that crystal decanter?  Yeah, let's do this.  Who, like, that we could talk to.  Right.  Has he been on?  Check that out.  Someone look into that.  So I'll save the handwritten note, even though I don't believe that's even...  What do they think, Paul Anker, if you're appearing on PMG TV? 
[01:57:00]  And especially for this wonderful crystal decanter.  Me.  Fuck.  For one day, I was feeling good.  You thought he...  One lousy day.  You know what?  I liked that show.  I liked that guy.  Yep.  We had a good time.  I'm going to get him a gift.  Yep.  No, it was send a gift out to every single...  No, no, no.  It was send the gift out.  Send the gift.  It had nothing to do with it.  Send the gift.  The gift that everyone gets.  He didn't even say that. 
[01:57:30]  His people already know at this point that...  Oh, he probably has no idea.  ...that they have to send the gift after Paul Anker comes through.  Yeah.  You'll be...  Hey, Paul, thank you for the decanter.  What?  I bet she doesn't even know.  Yeah.  Second appearance, the gift goes up.  Yeah.  His peeps.  Fuck.  He's just a classy guy.  That's an old school thing to do.  It's not classy if it's only 160 bucks.  Well, yeah, but...  It makes a great point.  Just a little something.  It looked like it was way more expensive.  I started getting bummed out when we did look up the price. 
[01:58:00]  Yeah.  I thought it was going to be a lot more.  $400 or $500, and...  Well, my friend...  I saw the price, too.  Kevin Pollack's was more expensive.  It was under $200, yeah.  My friend works for Tiffany's, and she had texted me and said,  that's the most basic fucking thoughtless gift you can give.  What, the Tiffany one from Kevin Pollack?  Uh, oh, is that from Kevin?  Oh, no, no, no.  Hold on.  Yeah.  Hold on.  Jimmy, you just threw Kevin Pollack under the bus.  Me, too.  I didn't mean to.  Look, man, this is the best day ever. 
[01:58:30]  I'm bringing in these shitty gifts tomorrow.  I'll give them to the listeners.  They probably have a wedding they have to go to soon.  I don't have a tear.  Both gifts are being given away tomorrow.  But Kevin's a fan of the show.  He's sincere.  Sorry, Kevin.  I thought that was the other one.  The most insincere garbage gift you could give.  Oh, Kevin.  Oh, Kevin.  Oh, yeah.  Sir, yeah, it gets worse. 
[01:59:00]  This is hilariously bad.  More of Opie and Anthony's worst of 2013.  2013, 2013.  Coming up.  Must share moments.  Opie and Anthony's worst of 2013.  Continues.  Hey, it's E-Rock.  It's the worst of 2013.  The Opie and Anthony show.  So looking back at the year that was and what it did to us to make us the fine, outstanding  gentlemen we are today.  Let's move on to Crispin Glover in studio. 
[01:59:30]  I'm shaking the paper vigorously to make a point.  Crispin Glover's in studio.  If you don't know, over the years, the Opie and Anthony show staff has a bit of an obsession  for the movie Back to the Future.  So this was a real treat, if you will, that Crispin came into the studio.  He's promoting one of those weird performance art projects that he's always involved in.  But we mostly wanted to talk to him about Back to the Future.  And Crispin did deliver.  Here it is.  Crispin Glover on the Opie and Anthony show.  The worst of 2013. 
[02:00:00]  The Opie and Anthony show.  You know, it was actually very informative to me in some of the things that I'm talking  about in terms of propaganda.  I know it's a very beloved film, but I, you know, I was only in the first film.  There was a, they had taken the molds of my face from the old age makeup from the original  film and put a, uh, another actor into prosthetics that were made from, from, from my face. 
[02:00:30]  And, uh, and then interspiced a very small amount of footage of me from the original film  in order to fool audiences into believing that I was in the movie.  I, because of my lawsuit, there are rules in the Screen Actors Guild that make it so producers,  uh, can never do something like that again.  I'm, I'm proud of the lawsuit, but the reason I, I, I, I bring it up is because the, the  reason that I didn't end up being in the film, it's, it's more complex than this, but I, I 
[02:01:00]  was asking questions that there, that the produce, the producer's director didn't like.  Right.  Um, I, I actually did work again with Robert Zemeckis, strangely enough, when I did Beowulf  and had a very good working relationship with him.  Um, but there was a, a different end in the original draft that I read for the screenplay.  I, I, when I auditioned for the part, I was only given what are called sides, the scene.  So I got the part, I was 20 years old. 
[02:01:30]  I got the role, my agent told me I'd gotten this part and I, I didn't really know everything  about it.  And I said, well, maybe I only knew that there was this other part that I was, the, the  scene I was doing the scene with.  I said, well, should I go in for this other part?  That seems like that could be a good part.  He said, no, no, you don't understand.  This is a really interesting role.  You're going to be playing the older versions of this character in a different time period.  And I thought, wow, that I said, that's fantastic.  I said, yeah, great.  Let's close the deal. 
[02:02:00]  You know, it's this big universal studios produced by Steven Spielberg and, uh, directed  by Robert Zemeckis.  So great.  So, but, you know, I was a serious actor as well.  So when I started actually analyzing the screenplay, once we were involved in the project, I had  questions about things and there was a different end.  I won't go into so many details about it, but, but I had questions about it and it, it did  get changed.  And I think there are other people that had questions because there are things in it that  could particularly in this day, day be thought of as well, offensive and, and those changes 
[02:02:30]  happened.  It had to do with money and what people were doing.  The characters were doing with money, but I didn't stop with it.  I said, I said to Robert Zemeckis, I thought it was, it was not a good idea for our characters  to have a monetary reward because it basically makes the moral of the film be that money equals  happiness and, uh, you know, by having the, uh, there, there were various things that were 
[02:03:00]  doing it, but by having the son character cheer by having a truck in, in the garage, I, what  I was arguing for was that it was that the characters should be in love and that the, the love  should be the reward by having, by, by just by having any kind of monetary element as a  reward, it makes it into a reward.  I, and I, I still feel the same way.  I've, I would like the film a lot better if there was no monetary, like there could be  signs of maybe monetary change would, would happen, but it was more important that the 
[02:03:30]  characters were in love.  I would feel much better about the film, but by having those monetary rewards in it, it  was, uh, it was a, uh, a propaganda and Zemeckis got really mad at me when I said this  and, uh, yeah, yeah, he yelled.  Yeah.  It's kind of odd, uh, discussing a film that old at this point, but, but didn't you see  at the end, the characters, they were more in love.  I think especially your character and the wife, they did seem to be, but, but, but my 
[02:04:00]  argument is that part was good.  I was all for it, but I think it pollutes it.  Do you think the money could have been a peripheral effect of the happiness that they  had, that they had changed?  I think it's a bad message.  Really?  I do.  I think it's a, I think because that's propaganda that, that says to people, go out and, and  borrow money for banks.  This is, this is a big part of why the film was successful because bank, the, the corporations 
[02:04:30]  knew that it had that moral element in it.  Maybe, maybe I, I would also argue, I mean, that's only because they knew that that was in  there.  Therefore, they can feel comfortable in, in funding it and, and putting a lot of money  into distributing it.  Maybe if that wasn't in there, Zemeckis and, and, and Bob Gale would have not have been  able to sell it as readily.  I don't know.  But, but what I, but I, what I would still argue is that if that wasn't in there and the  only part that was in there was that they were in love and that film still did get distributed 
[02:05:00]  as highly as it had and have as much money behind it, I still think the film would be  loved and it would be, I think personally, I think it would have a better moral.  Why do you, why do you feel since the character in there wasn't Crispin Glover, it was George  McFly.  Yeah.  Do you feel you have to inject part of your, uh, I was 20 years old.  I was a young, I was a young, I was a young idealist. 
[02:05:30]  I wouldn't, I wouldn't do that now.  I wouldn't do that now.  I wouldn't, well, I, I mean, I, I write, I, I've, at that time I didn't even know.  It was like, I just, I, I, I, I hadn't been in a few films, but not that many films.  And, and I, I'd been in acting class where we, we did improvisations.  I came up with scenes and thoughts.  So I thought it was okay to be asking questions like that.  Right, right.  Now I understand very specifically that, you know, there's a lot of money and, and people 
[02:06:00]  have gone through a certain amount of, uh, troubles in Zemeckis.  I'm sure.  This kid's asking us goddamn questions.  We're losing money here by the day.  Well, I mean, to be fair, I wasn't, I wasn't stopping production.  We were, we were, we were having a discussion during the time, but, uh, but, uh, it's still,  uh, yeah, no, I wouldn't, I wouldn't do that now.  I fund my films with the working in corporate movies.  I wouldn't, I, I, I know how things work at this point.  But why I was bringing it, bring it up, it was because it was informative to my, my thought 
[02:06:30]  process as to how propaganda does work, because I had this very early experience and I was,  you know, it, it caused me to not be in the sequels on some level.  I'm sure there's, it's, it's, it's complicated, but, uh, and then there was a lawsuit, you  know, it's not an, it was very specifically not a legal thing.  I mean, you can just say it's not a nice thing, but it's not a legal thing to do either.  So this informed me that if you, if you question propaganda, it has serious consequences. 
[02:07:00]  Can I ask you, when you mentioned, when you mentioned Robert Zemeckis, when you talked  to Zemeckis about what you thought that should have happened, how long into your explanation  did you realize he was not happy?  Like, did you, did he listen, hear you out or did he interrupt you and go, look?  Well, well, I, you know, it's a long time ago now.  I remember the one, one conversation very specifically, but what I am forgetting is the,  that there were two, there might've been two parts to the conversation because there 
[02:07:30]  was some part that I'm not going into the detail about that was changed.  And it might be that then I continued on because they changed one thing.  And I said, but there's still this monetary aspect.  And so he probably was not happy about it.  Right.  They'd already done a change.  And I think I, but I'm, I'm forgetting now it was, that part was a while back, but,  but, but, you know, but, but it's also, there's, there's also a part when you're working on  a film that on some level, it doesn't happen every day, but you do become passionate about  things that you want, want to get done. 
[02:08:00]  It's normal for actors and directors, not all, all the time, but it's relatively normal  to say, look, this is really important.  You, you, you speak it out passionately.  They speak it out passionately.  And then you say, okay, that's fine.  Then you shake hands and go, but you can have passionate conversations and it doesn't mean  necessarily that it's going to turn into some terrible thing years later.  But, but I mean, and my, my, my experience in the business has been good.  I, that would be the one real exception. 
[02:08:30]  That was, wasn't good.  That was, that was not a pleasant thing to have happen because people still believe that  that was me.  And, and the reason I had the lawsuit, it was the real reason, the primary reason that  I had it was, I just wanted people to know that I wasn't in there.  That it wasn't you, right.  Because I didn't, if I had played that part, I would have played it differently.  Right, yeah.  I didn't like the way that guy played it.  And people think that's me.  I didn't either.  Well, I, I mean, you know, I, I, I mean, I, it's, it's still, it still gets to me that, 
[02:09:00]  that, that, that there's that, that confusion.  And I, uh, uh, so what, what's the, what, what way is there to let it be known other  than, than do that?  So even still, that's why whenever the issue, anything about that spot up now, I do talk  about, I'm talking about it more also because there's one, one fellow, he might've even been  on your show.  I'm not sure that Bob Gale, yeah, Bob Gale was on.  Yeah.  I think I listened to it and he, on your show, he lied.  He lied about something.  Yeah.  And you guys automatically believed what he said. 
[02:09:30]  Oh man.  Reconcile it, please.  What he said was that I had, I'm just, let me, let me just make, be specific and let  me think.  He said that I had asked for the same amount of money that Michael J. Fox had, was getting  in the film.  It's, it's total fabrication.  The reason that he's doing this is because he wants to throw the track off of, of the  conversation of that, what they had done was illegal.  So he's trying to justify as to why it was good for them to do this illegal thing. 
[02:10:00]  And, and so then people automatically believe, oh, I remember what he said specifically was  that then I had called back after the thing was in production saying, oh, I want to do  it or something.  And so what was somebody corroborated and went, oops, or something like that.  I was like, I didn't do that.  I was working.  I actually did work on a different film at the time, a John Borman film, but it's, it's  what, what happened in the negotiation was I actually wanted to be in the film. 
[02:10:30]  Uh, but the, uh, the offer was less than half of what Leah Thompson and Tom Wilson, who had  similar sized roles and it just, it wasn't fair.  It was, it, my agents didn't think it was fair and, and it was a sequel.  I got paid, uh, the same amount or more than what I was being offered for back to the future  to do this other film.  So it was just like a monetary, and of course, this was a gigantically well-grossing film, 
[02:11:00]  but it's also why, why did they do that?  It's because I had, I read a great book.  I would recommend anybody read called how to win friends and influence people by Dale  Carnegie.  I only read it like in the, uh, 2000s.  I wish I'd read it when I was like a teenager, but, but the, one of the things that he really  illustrates well is don't prove people wrong.  And that's essentially what I was doing when I was having that argument with Zemeckis about 
[02:11:30]  that.  There was a moral issue here.  I was just thinking I was being like this, you know, it was a good moral of what I was  arguing for.  And I thought they'd see my point, you know, but, but, but, but I realized on some level  that I was, and especially with a lawsuit, I proved people wrong.  When you do something like that, then they come on the Opie and Anthony show and make lines  up and make up things.  Oh my God.  Well, we just assumed he was lying, but you guys were like, no, it sounds.  I'm like, all right, Jim. 
[02:12:00]  What do you think of Steven Spielberg?  Well, first off, Robert Zemeckis, I think can make interesting films.  I, you know, I, I, I, the second film that I did with him, uh, um, Beowulf, which was  written by Neil Gaiman and Roger Ivory, uh, I thought had very good moral, uh, elements  in it was about lies, which I have a lot of interest in and, and they, they did something 
[02:12:30]  very interesting with that film.  I think Zemeckis can get into a dark, uh, dark comedic territory.  That's, that's very interesting.  I liked, uh, what death becomes her and, uh, and, you know, he's, he can be, be interesting.  I, I tend toward feeling like, um, Steven Spielberg really does work very much in propaganda and,  and, and, and it's, it's very well hidden.  Uh, like I was saying a little bit about kind of war, um, if you analyze Steven Spielberg's 
[02:13:00]  films about war, they're essentially pro-war films.  And I, I, I, I don't think that's good at this point in time to do.  You look at a great war film, like All Quiets on the Western Front or Paths of Glory by Kubrick  or, uh, Full Metal Jacket by Kubrick.  They all are questioning, it's obviously not proper, happy ideas about war.  These are highly questioning that war is not a, there's no question war is a horrible thing. 
[02:13:30]  And you look at something like Saving Private Ryan, which is a very well liked film, but  essentially it's arguing that there's such a thing as a moral war, a good war.  And you, maybe you can make that argument.  I just think it's a bad argument to make, especially at this point in time.  I don't think that, I just, I wouldn't want to do that.  I've just, I don't, I don't understand why somebody in power, a power situation like that  is, is making films that are, are saying it's good to be going to war. 
[02:14:00]  Why do that?  What's, why?  Right.  I mean, I, I, I, I'm sure there's all kinds of people, veterans and things that, my father's  a veteran.  My father was in the Korean war, you know, but it was like, I, he very explained very  clearly to me when the Vietnam war was going on.  I was a kid.  I saw all those awful images.  I, my father said to me, war was horrible.  You know, it's like he was, he didn't have any like glory stories about being, being in 
[02:14:30]  the war and he was in bad situations.  So I, I just, I, I, maybe I'm a bleeding heart pacifist, but I just, I just think it's,  it's not good to be making pro war films.  So I, I question Spielberg.  And Spielberg is a powerful man that doesn't need the money.  So I think your point is he could, he could take all that power and, and do a more positive  message.  People could argue that, that private Ryan though was, uh, it did show a lot of the  horrors of, of, of war. 
[02:15:00]  Yeah.  But it's still, but still when you analyze it, somehow there's a positive element about,  about aspects of the war.  And I just, I don't think it's a good message to put out, which is my similar argument with,  with back to the future.  Yeah.  There, there, there are interesting elements in back to the future.  The structure is excellent.  It's all, it's part of why the, it's part of why I had strong arguments because I could  see what that moral element was.  And I knew it would have, uh, I knew it would have effect within the culture or I felt it  would.  Yeah.  And so, uh, when you analyze those things, it's like, you've got a lot of money. 
[02:15:30]  You've got a lot of power, do something that's going to genuinely affect the culture at large  in a very positive, uh, way.  And I, I just, I don't, I suppose, I'm sure I would assume Steven Spielberg feels like he  was doing something positive.  I, I would argue that it would be much more positive if there was a clear anti-war message.  You ever think though, sometimes that there, there are, you know, there's filet mignon and 
[02:16:00]  then there's a steak from your freezer.  Like some things are just made to be, you can argue it, but I can't help it be, be analytical.  It's just my nature.  Yeah, obviously.  And, and when you look overall at, you know, our culture, it's easy to study something like  Soviet Russia or Nazi Germany and, and condemn those things rightfully so, but terrible things  went on in those cultures with propaganda, but it's more difficult for our culture to 
[02:16:30]  analyze our own propaganda, especially in the media.  Uh, but I think it's important to do it.  And it, because I think, I think our, our culture's media is much more well oiled than  even Soviet Russia or Nazi Germany because people don't notice it.  And, and so things like saying, well, it's just, this is a fun movie or all that, you  know, there, there is, I enjoy movies that I'm sure would be strong propaganda as well,  just because something's propaganda doesn't mean it's not a good movie, but, but I think  it's really important to have the discussion so that people are aware of this. 
[02:17:00]  And I don't really see the, see the discussion happening in our, uh, specifically about film,  which is what I'm most passionate about.  It happens in, in other areas, a little bit about politics and things like that.  But, you know, I, I just, I, again, as this young idealist, when I was 16, I wanted to  be a part of this industry that was questioning things.  I'd like it to come back.  Do you think there's a director out there kind of in the mainstream that's doing it right?  I think, I think there are a lot of directors that are passionate and want to do it. 
[02:17:30]  And any, any films that were pretty popular that you're like, yes, they're doing it right.  That's a positive message for our culture.  Maybe, maybe I, I, I, I hesitate to, to point to things, but there are, there are, I can  tell there's some directors working in the corporate industry that are striving really  hard.  And every once in a while they do, there is a film that'll come out and, and that asks  questions for real and, and is artful.  And anytime a director has stuck with it and done it, I stand up and applaud. 
[02:18:00]  I mean, it's an amazing feed.  Do you want to mention one?  Well, the ones I more think of are not big popular, popular films.  I very much like Gaspar Noé's Enter the Void, but that's not, you know, a big, huge popular  film.  I thought that was a really well-made film.  I, I see things that happen in, in the, the corporate films that there's some, there are  some very good directors that I'd love to work with.  Uh, but, but it's, I, I get nervous about getting into putting examples because then 
[02:18:30]  people can easily say, well, this film did this and this, and I might agree with them.  So, cause I can see that even when somebody's really striving hard, uh, maybe there are reasons  why it didn't go as hard as it could have gone.  But, but I mean, again, I'm, I'm so glad to be a part of the industry and I want to work  with people.  I don't want to be, it's, it's difficult for me to talk like this.  Cause I feel like, I feel like so many people are friends with Spielberg or Zemeckis and  think I'm, I'll never work with this guy as a jerk. 
[02:19:00]  I'm sure.  Nobody in this room is friends with those guys.  Believe me.  Well, I, I, I, I, well, I, but like, uh, Bob Gale was on the show.  So it's like, it does, it does happen.  And, and I, it's, well, you set the record straight today.  I'm glad.  I'm glad.  And we apologize for that.  You know, I don't know.  We didn't have your phone number.  It's not, I mean, I mean, why, why, why wouldn't, uh, people, uh, think something's true.  But the re the reason I, I, I point to it specifically is he was involved in something 
[02:19:30]  that, you know, I've, I've seen even when I use the word illegal, uh, that people go,  Oh, drama queen.  But very specifically, I saw somebody write those words tattooed over my ass, but very  specifically, uh, you know, uh, I, I, it was illegal.  And, and so if some, and he was a prime architect of that illegal activity.  So, so there's a motive to make something, uh, seem, uh, you know, like it was, it was 
[02:20:00]  justified to do this.  And that's why he's, he's saying these things should have looked at him and just said, now  don't con me, Bob.  Yeah.  I mean, I, you know, he's the, he, he's, he said a lot of things.  It's not just that there are negative things that have been said to me and then about me  on the Blu-rays that are, are, are not true.  And, uh, commentary really?  Yeah.  Yeah.  He said things that are like, I mean, I haven't listened to it all in completion myself, but  I've had people come up and say, did this, this, and this, I said, where did you hear 
[02:20:30]  that?  And they said on the, on the commentary on the Blu-ray for back to the future.  And, and, uh, it's always from him.  I, I, it's not from Robert Zemeckis.  It's not, I mean, Steven Spielberg doesn't comment at all, but, but anything is, uh, Bob  Gale still is, that's his main, um, career at this point as well.  He, he doesn't really write films, uh, anymore.  He's not involved in the industry other than having to do with, uh, things having to do with 
[02:21:00]  back to the future.  So I think the fact that there was this lawsuit and, uh, he, he has a lot of focus specifically  on that, uh, film series.  Uh, he has a lot going on in his mind about it specifically that there was an illegal action  and that was, it's in the public records.  So he has to justify it.  It is just an odd thing that, that, that movie did become so beloved in, uh, uh, American,  uh, well, and, and, and, and part of it is, is, is it, part of it is that there are good 
[02:21:30]  structural elements.  There are interesting things in it.  Uh, and unfortunately that element, there are other movies that, that in the history of  U S filmmaking that do similar elements with their structure where it seems as though it's  about love, but there's a, there's a monetary reward and they're very popular films.  I think a lot of people see it though, as a boy, who wouldn't want to go back in time  and change things for the better when you then come back and you're like, wow, I fixed, 
[02:22:00]  I fixed it.  That part's great.  Yeah.  That part, that, that's a big part of why it's, and that's, that's what's also is my,  my argument about it.  It's like, all of this stuff is great.  Why do you need to put this, this, this monetary reward in it?  It would, it would make it such a, a, a more pure message of love instead of, instead  of, uh, uh, you know, dirtying it up with, uh, with, uh, a messy, uh, element. 
[02:22:30]  You'd have rather seen a 67 Falcon in that garage.  I would have rather not that that didn't happen.  I would have just rather that there was, uh, you know, and the, the, the, the, the scene  was also reshot.  You know, there was a different actor playing the part originally, uh, Eric Stoltz originally  played the part and then, uh, Michael J. Fox replaced him.  We had already shot the, the sequence that I'm, I'm talking about the alternate future  and I had played it slightly differently.  And, uh, then they fired back to, uh, Eric Stoltz and, uh, I thought I was going to get 
[02:23:00]  fired as well.  Uh, uh, but we, Robert Zemeckis made it very clear that he wanted me to play it quite, uh,  relatively different than I, I had played it originally.  And I had the point that we shot the alternate, uh, uh, future, um, the second time when we  shot that scene, I was basically, I would call it acting from the spinal cord.  I was, I was afraid.  I was, I was genuinely afraid.  Oh yeah.  I thought I was going to get fired if I didn't do exactly what, what, what they said. 
[02:23:30]  I didn't want, you know, I was, again, I was 20.  I didn't want to get fired.  I wasn't looking for controversy.  So yeah, I wanted to do a good job.  How would you have liked to have seen that ending play out if you had say the only thing  was that I didn't think that there should have been monetary, the, what, the kind of  clothes we were wearing.  Okay.  That's what I was getting into.  So when they walk in, uh, they've been playing tennis and they have nice clothes on, like  all that was, I, I, I, I thought it just, it was, it all pointed toward this idea that 
[02:24:00]  happiness was about wealth.  It made me really uncomfortable what I was wearing, holding a tennis record.  I did it because I thought I was going to get fired, but I, I vocalized that I didn't  think this was a good idea.  And I think there's even might be some commentary on the Blu-ray about where they said, oh, Crispin  didn't like his clothes.  I didn't care about, I didn't care about the clothes.  It was like, I cared about the message.  And, and so, and so that was a very specific message. 
[02:24:30]  I, you know, I didn't write, I, again, I wouldn't do it now.  Obviously.  I wouldn't make that complaint now.  I, I, I would have looked at the, the, the whole screenplay.  I would have analyzed what was going on.  I would have known, okay, there, there's this element of propaganda and I'll, maybe I'll  say something and if they don't want to do it, fine.  But I, I, I, I was, you know, 20 years old is really quite young.  I hear you just don't understand how compelling this is for me to ask you this.  Sure.  I'm glad to talk about it.  No, I was just wondering, like, because I think, I think the happiness and, and how 
[02:25:00]  do you show success?  He went from being, you know, the goofy kind of loser guy to being very successful because  of what happened in that moment.  Well, I mean, I mean, how do you, how do you show the success part?  There's a lot, a million ways you can do it.  I mean, I mean, I, but, but we're not, it can, it could take days to really sit and  figure out exactly what it is.  I, I, I, it's not something that I'm prepared to, to, to say exactly what the illustration 
[02:25:30]  of it would be.  I'm sure there would be a cinematic illustration of, of, of love and success that, that would  work.  And I, I don't have that answer at this moment.  And was it odd that Biff would be around the house at all seeing what he did?  Well, see that, that, that's part of what the change was from what I originally read  in the screenplay.  There were different people.  It wasn't Biff.  That was the servant to the, the, the, the family. 
[02:26:00]  And, and I had questions about it and, and it did get, did they have slaves or something?  I don't want to, I don't want to go into a lot of detail, but, but, but.  That's the first thing I thought of when you said that.  I, I know.  Well, I, I don't want to go into a lot.  I am actually in the, I'll write it down in a book at some point.  I'd love to read it, Chris.  Oh yeah.  Yeah.  It gets worse.  Let's get some asshole sniffing going.  Let's pep this place up into a mood of fun and festivity.  More of Opie and Anthony's worst of 2013. 
[02:26:30]  Coming up.  Opie and Anthony's worst of 2013.  Continues.  Right now.  Right now.  Right now.  Right now.  Welcome back.  My name is Erock and I will be guiding you through the worst of 2013 for the Opie and Anthony  show.  Looking back at the year of all the cool, crazy, wild nonsense that happened and giving you  some of the big highlights that you really need to know about.  But we constantly are getting asked to do stuff, not just on the show, but outside of 
[02:27:00]  the show, put on an event, do something that will attract attention, create some buzz,  something that the company really can get behind.  And after thinking for a while, we came up with a concept, the O and a bus trip.  We were going to go around this great land of ours and meet you, the listeners in the  weirdest places that we could find places we hadn't been to yet and have some fun with  this thing.  So yeah, that was the plan.  The O and a bus tour.  Sounds impressive.  Let's see what happened to it.  Opie and Anthony's worst of 2013. 
[02:27:30]  We were going through Branson, Missouri videos the other night and just laughing at how horrible  Branson, Missouri is.  Well, horrible.  Let me bring this to the discussion.  They want us to do a bus tour, right?  Yes.  And E-Rock came up with a pretty good idea when we were all talking.  These guys down the hall want us to do the same old, same old bus tour.  No offense, because we love these areas, but we've been there a million times. 
[02:28:00]  They want us to basically go, basically, Boston, New York, Philly, Washington, maybe squeeze  up to Cleveland.  Love all those places.  And we'll be back.  Yeah.  And E-Rock's like, why don't we go to places we've never been and maybe we'd go just to  Branson.  Oh my God.  I would love that.  Can you imagine broadcasting from Branson, Missouri?  Yeah.  I want to go to Branson.  Troy wants to go to Dollywood.  We go Dollywood.  We go Branson. 
[02:28:30]  Branson.  Could you do that in the same trip?  Do you know what Branson has?  Remember a little act in Vegas called Ziegfried and Roy?  Sure.  With the tigers and stuff?  Sure.  They have a guy just as good named Kirby.  And he's got a tiger and he does a fucking tiger show.  Kirby.  All right.  Let's go see Kirby.  Fucking Kirby.  And you want music?  Yeah.  How about Pierce Arrow?  Exactly.  What's Pierce Arrow?  They're apparently a very big band down there. 
[02:29:00]  Look at Kirby.  Kirby!  Oh, Kirby.  Jesus.  We were watching videos of the hotels around Branson.  Yeah.  And you know what they were?  You know the highlights?  They were highlighting and putting little text on the bottom.  They were like, covered entrance.  Nice.  So you pull up and there's a covered entrance to the hotel.  And then they'd be like, the lobby.  And then they showed the rooms.  Yeah.  They literally showed the hairdryer on the wall three times during the thing because it's 
[02:29:30]  such a special one.  But that's nice though.  Instead of getting it out of the closet.  Oh, yeah.  Do you know there's a Titanic replica?  Really?  In there where you go on to an actual replica of the Titanic.  All right.  That's nice.  It's half the Titanic.  Well, why not the whole Titanic?  I don't think they could afford it.  Or the other half's in the water.  And that's probably what they're trying to say.  Maybe.  Maybe.  Maybe.  There's a Hollywood Wax Museum in Branson.  Yeah.  We have to go.  Wow.  Look at Kirby's theater.  Kirby has his own place. 
[02:30:00]  Oh, yeah.  They all have their own place.  The Yakov Dinner Adventure.  That's its own place too.  Can't we have our own place in Branson?  I would love.  Imagine Opie and Anthony go to Branson.  They're gambling there too, right?  Do they?  No.  They're a dry town too.  So why don't we do Dollywood, Branson?  I thought they did car gambling there.  I don't know.  You've got to go to the liquor store and buy your booze or something in another town.  And then you can take it there and drink.  But all these clubs, all these horrible places to see like Kirby, you can't drink in there.  You've got to see Kirby stone-fucking-sober. 
[02:30:30]  He's the prince of magic though.  He is the prince of magic.  You should get all fucked up in a bus.  Yeah, that's true.  Get fucked up in the bus.  Stumble into Kirby.  Get off and see Kirby.  Look down there for an answer.  How many hours from New York City to Branson?  Someone out there knows.  How many hours from New York to Branson, Missouri?  I will guess.  I'm going to say it's pretty far.  It's like in the middle of the country.  It is.  It's a little further east than west, but it's probably pretty fucking far.  Is it pushing the middle of the country?  Yeah, it's pretty close to. 
[02:31:00]  So that's a week.  Yeah.  How far?  How far is it?  What?  What?  What?  18 hours.  18 hours?  Well, we could sleep.  We don't have to drive.  We could fly to St. Louis and meet the bus.  Whoa.  Now you're talking.  Wow.  You hit it, man.  You fly out.  You grab the bus in Branson, Missouri, and then we make our way home.  Missouri, Tennessee.  We could hit up Kentucky. 
[02:31:30]  We could hit up to Tennessee.  I did.  Got to go to West Virginia.  I did notice on the videos, there is a brand new airport in Branson, too.  All right.  All right.  So, I don't know what kind of plane's flying in there.  Maybe the one that William Devane is flying in his gold commercial.  I'll get a ride from him.  Bill Devane is a show-off.  It really is.  Oh, look.  I got a plane.  I got gold.  I'm by a big tree.  I ride horses.  All right.  Eat Bill Devane.  Why don't we get a ride from Mr. Lee Abrams? 
[02:32:00]  Oh, he flies.  I'm sure he's still flying out there.  Oh, boy.  I remember when he had something to do with this whole mess.  I miss Lee Abrams.  All the creative people were shown the door or left his place years ago.  Years ago.  Years.  Years ago.  Everything that was a cliche in radio, he would come over and yell at you to stop doing it.  Yeah, stop doing it.  It's like, but wait, what if I do it ironically?  Yeah, we learned a lot from him.  You're a hipster.  I don't know if he liked us at first, though.  Probably not.  I don't think he got it.  He ended up liking us, though.  Yeah.  A lot of people don't like us when they first meet us. 
[02:32:30]  Or after.  Or after.  Or during.  Or during.  That's why I think I'm reaching out to Jim Chandler.  That is nice of you.  I think that's where I made my mistake.  When I was 18, I should have played it differently.  Hey, where is he broadcast from?  Nashville.  Nashville?  You know what?  Well, how far is Nashville?  Would he welcome us into his studio to do our radio show alongside his radio show?  Tennessee actually shares a tiny bit of border with Missouri.  Missouri. 
[02:33:00]  Yes.  Where's the Nashville part, though?  I don't even know.  XM has studios in Nashville.  Oh, man.  Why would we go there?  Jim Chandler's there.  That's why.  Where's Nashville?  I know Tennessee, but what part?  I have no idea.  Is it the middle of the state?  Is it where?  I always get confused between Memphis and Nashville, where they are in the state.  Yeah, right in the middle.  It's right in the middle.  Nashville's in the middle.  Memphis is where.  All right, then we could squeeze through Kentucky.  I hear we have a lot of fans in Kentucky.  We could meet up with Dr. Steve.  Dr. Steve's in Kentucky. 
[02:33:30]  We could get our prostates checked.  Flood.  Pierce Arrow.  The Pierce Arrow Theater.  They all have their own theaters, and they're all lumps of shit.  The theaters are all like these fucking horrible looking places.  Can we hear one Pierce Arrow song?  Oh, get some Pierce Arrow on there.  Please.  Let's hear some Pierce Arrow.  This is what we'd hear if we went to Branson, Missouri. 
[02:34:00]  I would guess there's some kind of Christian rock band.  I don't know.  Banner of Liberty.  Oh, no.  Here it is.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Pause it for a second.  All right.  Hold on.  What happens in Branson, by the way?  Stays in Branson?  It's very...  Yes.  Fortunately, they stay there.  Because you don't want it to anybody.  No.  You don't want it anywhere else.  You're too embarrassed.  They're very patriotic.  It's this over-the-top, horrid, fake patriotism.  A lot of flag-waving.  A lot of USA. 
[02:34:30]  You know, Yakov does this whole tribute to being an immigrant and coming over here.  And making good.  And the dream.  Yes.  It is dinner theater.  And I guess Pierce Arrow performs Banner of Liberty.  Let's hear what Pierce Arrow from Branson, Missouri sounds like.  Oh, my God.  This stinks already.  Look at this horrible stage.  Ew.  In a mid-western town, children form a parade. 
[02:35:00]  You'd have to listen to this for two hours.  It's a two-hour show.  In the way.  These guys are the king of Branson.  There's farmers and teachers, the old and the young.  Farmers, teachers, the old and the young.  Here they come.  Bring it on home.  All of them now.  And I pledge my allegiance to the grand old life. 
[02:35:30]  Harmony.  But they're not singing together.  I pledge my allegiance to the grand old flag.  And they all started applauding.  This is like a cult.  Branson's a cult.  But they're not in sync.  No, they really sound horrible.  Pierce Arrow. 
[02:36:00]  It doesn't matter how they sound, Opie.  They got pink LeMay jackets on.  What's even creepier is someone decided they needed to fucking tape this and put it on YouTube?  Yes.  Well, the Pierce Arrow fans.  The testimonials I've heard about Branson and Pierce Arrow have been wonderful.  Can we find that video?  Pierce Arrow sang at a Sarah Palin rally.  Of course they did.  Remember her?  That makes perfect sense.  Of course you don't.  Victory in Missouri.  Well, I want to hear the fans talking about Pierce Arrow.  Put some Pierce Arrow testimonials. 
[02:36:30]  Testimonials?  Testimonials.  All right.  Testicles.  Put in testes just for the fun of it.  Testosterone.  Testimonial.  Anything?  Any people talking about it?  No one.  No?  I mean, no one.  I know.  Like Branson testimonials.  People talk about how great Branson is.  Is it on YouTube?  We love it.  We win.  We saw Pierce Arrow.  Then we saw Yakov's Dinner Adventure, which was just so fun. 
[02:37:00]  You gotta go.  Then we went back to the motel, which, by the way, has a covered entrance and a lobby.  The kids just, the kids had hours of fun playing with the hair dryer.  They're advertising they have a lobby.  A lobby.  Wow.  And then there was a communal dining area.  Oh, God.  That was as big as a walk-in closet.  Really?  Yeah, terrible.  That's all we gotta go.  We really do have to go.  When you can go to Branson. 
[02:37:30]  Is the Brady brunch still there?  I hope so.  Remember Greg Brady was in Branson doing the Brady brunch?  He's in that other theater right next to Yakov.  So that means he has to live down there.  Fun things to do in Branson.  Oh, yeah.  Stand by Branson might not have been on your radar before.  Three lakes, by the way.  Three lakes.  Count them.  Count them.  There's a new airport.  They have a Hilton.  They're trying to make it sound exciting.  They say Missouri is the show-me state.  Yeah.  Show me the way out of here.  Let us show you how Branson can now meet your needs better than ever before. 
[02:38:00]  Yeah.  A lot of tight shots.  That's never good.  Oh, they love those fountains and flames by their lake.  Golf course.  The duck tour.  They got the duck boats.  It's a hoot.  A water park.  Water park.  This is something you could find in any state.  You don't have to leave your state to get a water park or something.  Pierce Arrow.  Look at all the fun people are having.  It looks like Universal. 
[02:38:30]  Now, you book a trip to Branson, Missouri.  Yeah.  How long does it take before you realize you made a horrible mistake?  We've all done that with vacations where it looks good on the internet or whatever.  Yes.  And you get there and you still keep an open mind.  And then by the first night, you're so depressed.  Yes.  What the fuck?  Do you know they were showing a video of things to do?  And they showed shopping?  Right.  And their video for shopping was a strip mall where there was a dress barn. 
[02:39:00]  It was a dress barn.  Could you imagine?  Like, well, the man and the girls went shopping.  Well, we found a dress barn.  Iraq comment.  They're not just, you know, a dress barn.  They're the outlet stores.  Oh, the outlet stores.  But their big video about how great Branson, Missouri is, they just did a long piece on their airport.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Who cares?  Well, it is brandy new.  If you don't fucking crash, you're fine.  You used to not be able to fly right into Branson.  Oh, that's why it's a big deal?  Oh, yeah.  Okay.  One of a kind independent properties. 
[02:39:30]  Oh, that looks great.  It seems like they're coaxing you into timeshare.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Look at these fucking shitty hotels.  These are all the hotels on the Long Island Express.  Yes.  And they keep going back to the same shots that they already used.  Same shot.  Right.  Because there's only three things there.  Play here.  This is the play here.  Being the defense lawyers, I need a destination that offers plenty of live entertainment.  We're there.  In the live music show. 
[02:40:00]  We're there.  That's the big thing.  We're there.  We're there.  More than 100 different shows.  In 50 state-of-the-art theaters, ranging from small venues to 3,000 seats.  Oh, a Blues Brothers show.  Yeah.  Variety is the star of the show in Branson.  Oh, there was Yakov.  Every era, every style, every musical taste.  Look at these shitty shows.  I would be fucking horrified.  It looked like there was some kind of Beatles thing happening there.  Andy Williams and Glenn Campbell.  One's dead, one has Alzheimer's.  We're there. 
[02:40:30]  We're there.  Oh, we're there playing golf.  That's their thing.  Branson, we're there.  Yeah.  Did you say Murder Rock?  Murder Rock?  Yeah.  Sounds dangerous.  Three lakes, by the way.  Count them.  I think you mentioned that earlier.  Are you going to go fly fishing?  What about shopping?  What about it?  There's a dietetic association with mostly women.  Wait, I bet they're there.  They have to have great shopping.  We're there.  Fire, fountains, and fun.  Compliment upscale shopping and dining.  Look at their shopping. 
[02:41:00]  There's a lids.  Branson Landing Cruises has chargers available.  Can you pause this?  If you're longing for something.  You know they had a meeting in a boardroom somewhere and they're like, we needed a slogan.  Yeah.  And then some idiot just goes, we're there.  Oh, God, that's brilliant.  Let's go with it.  Let's go with the first one someone just blurts out.  Right, let's go.  That would be the first one.  All right, put it up.  Put it up on everything.  We're there.  Put it everywhere.  How about you're here?  No.  No, no.  I don't like that one.  That's stupid.  You're here.  How about, sir, we're there?  We're there.  Think about it. 
[02:41:30]  Print it up.  How about have some of mine?  Is that what he said?  What is Troy's fucking...  Here's some of mine.  And here's some of mine.  And here's some of mine.  Branson, and here's some of mine.  And you bend over and fucking...  Branson, and here's some of mine.  Get some Branson shit under your nose.  How great would that be if the video was just going and then some guy just jumps into the shot,  and here's some of mine.  And here's some of mine.  He likes his asshole finger under his nose. 
[02:42:00]  Branson.  People want us to know that Dollywood's even worse.  We know that.  Yes.  We have never been to either place, but we are pretty certain that Dollywood is way worse  than Branson.  Can we go back to the Branson video?  Oh, yeah.  See what's going on.  Travel video.  We're there.  We're there?  Historic downtown Branson offer nostalgia.  And we're just scratching the surface.  Branson boasts three factory outlet centers, numerous specialty shops, and art galleries.  No wonder Branson's...  Just by my art in Branson, at the outlet center. 
[02:42:30]  All my groups bring kids to the convention.  Kids.  So I have to consider what there is for families to do.  We're there.  Oh!  Oh.  Oh, let your kid play in a water park and get fucking explosive diarrhea from a virus.  It's a shitty fucking amusement park.  It's a shitty amusement park.  Oh, there's shows for the kids.  It's a really private event. 
[02:43:00]  Another spectacular...  Oh, Titanic.  ...that's perfect for progressive dinners is the Titanic.  They made an attraction out of a fucking nightmare.  Disaster.  Yeah, that's their...  Jump on board the Titanic.  Yeah, that sounds great.  How about no?  In Branson.  The whole city's the Titanic.  And I've been tricked into that old train thing.  Yeah.  I got one of those old trains.  Oh.  Where does the old train go?  Well, it goes over there.  It goes over there.  And then if you want, you stay on the train.  It goes back over here.  It goes back.  We allow you to be on the train for a total of four toot-toots. 
[02:43:30]  Right.  Nothing worse than the old train that doesn't go anywhere.  There'll be other slogans coming in for Branson.  Branson, why?  That's a good one.  Why?  When you could go to Vegas.  Why?  Yeah.  Branson, because you can't afford Vegas.  What are you doing here?  Yeah.  What?  Branson, what are you doing here?  You see the zoom out of the shopping area?  Yeah.  It was such a tight zoom out. 
[02:44:00]  Yeah.  It was zooming out.  Usually when they zoom out, they go from one street to like 10.  But it was one street and then like a couple trees.  That's all they had.  Get to the next shot.  Branson.  Branson.  Meet here.  Oh.  It's meet in Branson.  Anybody who is in the business of planning conventions, you're looking for value.  Could you imagine how-  No, you're looking for hookers.  How pissed you'd be if you fucking, hey guys, we got our big convention this year.  And you're thinking, oh, Vegas. 
[02:44:30]  It's going to be Vegas this year.  It's going to be great.  It's going to be Vegas.  I know what I know.  Holy shit.  Even like Florida.  I know what I know.  We're going to go.  Oh my God.  You know what?  I was talking with management about Atlantis down in the Bahamas.  Right.  Perfect.  I bet it's the fucking Bahamas.  And we already did Orlando.  So we can't be going back to Florida.  Guys, I'll give you a little hint.  We're there.  And then you're sitting there like, wait, wait.  What do you mean?  No.  What do you mean?  No, all of a sudden he pulls his dress shirt to reveal the we're there fucking t-shirt. 
[02:45:00]  The we're there t-shirt with the Branson logo.  And then every co-worker responds to him by giving him, and here's some of mine.  And here's some of mine.  We're there.  We're there.  Mmm.  Ah.  Ah.  That doesn't say a lot.  No.  No.  We're there.  It makes us nothing.  Like, why would I go there?  I mean, we're here.  Yeah, look.  We're here.  We're there.  We're here.  What are you going to...  It's like, we're here.  What are you going to do?  We're just kind of...  Let's make the best of it.  Yeah. 
[02:45:30]  That's what happened.  They were in the meeting, and they were like, well, what is Branson?  And some guy was like, I don't know.  We're just kind of there.  We're there.  Yeah, it's just kind of one of those we're there places.  They took the word stuck out.  We're stuck there.  We have a little of everything, but nothing's really spectacular.  No.  No.  We're just kind of there, I guess.  No.  We got the golf, but the course isn't that great.  Yeah.  It wasn't designed by any PGA guys or anything.  No, no.  We got the three lakes, but...  Yeah.  It's really cold and rocky. 
[02:46:00]  Come to the Yakov Shmirnov-designed golf course.  Like Yakov design it.  Ah, yeah.  Let's get to the end of this video.  Dan Sorter is waiting.  Providing that value.  It's relatively inexpensive.  I bet they're there.  There's phenomenal options available for off-site tours for your attendees.  And so that variety, in addition to the value...  Ah, value.  You never want to hear value.  You don't want to hear value.  People on the street to the tourism department to the hotels and the restaurants, all were glad we were here. 
[02:46:30]  I bet they were.  They were still welcome from the moment we arrived until the moment we left.  And that's why we come back every year.  It's a relaxed setting.  It's a place where it's not just you come and there's lots of things to do.  Oh.  But you can come and be relaxed and lots of things to do.  You don't want to...  You think they're...  I look back at the...  You think they're holding these people's kids hostage?  Yeah.  Right off camera, there's fucking, like, jihad people.  Branson jihadists.  With machine guns to their heads.  It's great.  We love Branson. 
[02:47:00]  All right.  You can have your kid back.  We got what we needed.  Hey.  It's all right.  Branson is worse.  Ah.  18,000 guest rooms.  250 restaurants.  52 theaters.  100 shows.  200 holes of golf.  Wow.  It's a long day.  New airport.  Ah, they love their new airport.  We're there.  Are you here yet?  Are you here yet?  No.  No.  It's we're there.  Are you here yet?  No.  No, apparently I'm not.  You know, the city's got nothing going on when they're bragging about how many holes of golf they have. 
[02:47:30]  Not how many golf courses.  Literally, they're counting the holes on the golf course.  Yeah.  That would be about 11 golf courses.  Right.  Guys, I gotta tell you.  I'm sold.  Let's go.  But we should go.  Oh, you know what?  Yes, we should.  We should just go.  We should go.  How great would that be if we were just in front of a Branson crowd and got to yell out,  We're there!  And everybody goes,  What?  That's right, everybody!  Branson, show us your tits!  Oh, show us your tits. 
[02:48:00]  Branson, show us your tits.  If we go to Branson, we can't do it on the up and up.  Because they'll get excited.  They'll set us up in a nice spot.  Yes.  And then we'll fucking ruin everything.  So you're thinking we just drive the bus down there and do the event in a parking lot somewhere?  I don't know.  We'll find some place.  Maybe we'll just invite all our fans to Yakov's Dinner Theater.  I want to go see Yakov's Dinner Theater.  Because you get a meal and your meal is not going to spill.  You get chicken cordon bleu, by the way.  Right.  You get a vegetable medley.  Nice.  A dessert.  I get so pissed off because I hate using plastic utensils. 
[02:48:30]  No, no, no, no, no.  Real silverware.  Wow.  Real linen napkins.  What?  Linen.  Yes.  No paper for Yakov.  And the tray is magnetic.  Oh!  So it sticks on the movie theater seat you're sitting in with your family.  When you've got to talk to each other and you've got to lean forward and go,  Hey, five fucking people down.  Let me talk to you in this nice dinner atmosphere.  Wouldn't you rather have paper towels over linen napkins?  Of course.  That linen shit just smears everything on your face. 
[02:49:00]  It doesn't absorb shit.  Well, Yakov thinks differently and he knows.  Wow.  Vegetable medley?  Come on.  Yeah.  Who doesn't like a good vegetable medley?  Fashion over function.  Yeah, exactly.  The original slogan was...  Hold on.  Let me see.  Hi to Jim.  Jim, go ahead.  What was the original slogan?  Jim Chandler?  The original slogan, which they passed on because they thought it was too much of a tongue twister,  was,  Where?  With a question mark.  Come on.  We're where? 
[02:49:30]  Branson.  Sorry.  A little controversy.  Is there?  During the little break, huh?  Wow.  I'm talking a little bit about the bus trip.  Oh.  The bus trip that it looks like perhaps September.  Is that what we're gunning for here, people?  Yep.  They have a date in September that they have hammered.  Hammering.  Saying this is the date.  Solid date.  Of course, the Opie and Anthony program and all of its cronies, flunkies, and henchmen will 
[02:50:00]  be hopping on two luxury buses headed south for the destination of Austin, Texas.  Uh, but on the way down, we will be stopping in various, uh, cities and, uh, landmarks and, uh, just, uh, crappy podunk towns.  Barry Williams driveway, for example.  In Branson, Missouri.  Right.  We are going to be going to Branson.  Um, and, uh, we will be stopping along the way just, uh, every so often to do a show, to fucking hang out, meet some people, things like that. 
[02:50:30]  Uh, uh, Kenny?  Kenny?  Kenny?  Anthony, please.  Oh.  Oh.  There you go.  Anthony, please don't put the cart before the horse.  Whoa.  What happened?  I don't know.  Let's, let's see what happens now with this bus trip.  Why?  What do you mean?  We can't put the cart before the horse.  Is that what you're being told?  Yes.  What is the, what does that mean?  In this case.  It means I could have this trip done in a week, but you can't put the cart before the horse. 
[02:51:00]  Whoa.  Controversy.  I hear ya.  I know.  It's always, there's a lot of controversy when we try to do something here at SiriusXM Satellite Radio.  Uh, and Kenny is one of the best, uh, road managers ever.  He, he dealt with the dice, Andrew Dice Clay.  Uh, he knows the ups and downs, ins and outs of a topsy-turvy world of, uh, hardcore rock and roll, uh, touring.  Yeah, didn't Dice do a bus tour?  We did several bus tours.  Several bus tours. 
[02:51:30]  Private jets, everything.  Private jets, everything.  Yeah.  And, uh, so Kenny, throwing in his vast knowledge of this, logistics and whatnot, um, he's made some suggestions.  And I gather the response has been, don't put the cart before the horse.  Yes.  All right.  So, um, Iraq, get, uh, behind the cart.  Ha ha.  See.  You almost went the whole day.  I know.  Very close.  Um, what, what, what, what seems to be one of the issues here? 
[02:52:00]  Can they, are they getting it together?  I'm low man on the totem pole.  Perhaps you should consult somebody.  They're very territorial, aren't they?  Yeah.  Yeah.  And things are, I mean, Kenny talking like this on the air is not going to bode well for him.  There's going to be another.  It's probably going to be shit, right?  There'll be another.  He's going to, he's in for at least another conversation or two.  Oh no, I'm, I'm, I'm late.  I'm waiting now.  I'm laying back.  And I'm just, uh, you know, I, my assistance is offered when they're ready to offer it. 
[02:52:30]  Yeah.  Accept it.  They would accept you.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  And well, they should, you, like I said, a vast knowledge of being on the road with an  actual touring celebrity.  Not, uh, you know, one.  Yeah.  Yeah, exactly.  Let's not forget the infamous Jim Norton.  Of course.  Yeah.  Bus tour.  Because that's all I can sell out is a bus.  Oh, you're talking about the actual bus.  I perform on them. 
[02:53:00]  50 tickets to go on the bus.  No, Jimmy.  Fucking, I should be, I have a Captain America outfit with a Z on it for zilch.  Captain zilcho.  Captain zilcho.  With a hyphen.  No zilcho.  Oh no.  Oh, Jimmy.  Well, you're at the stress factor.  Yeah.  Good.  Good for me.  Get down there.  Get down there, peoples.  It'll be a good show.  I'm sure it'll be terrific.  732-545-ha-ha.  Mr. Relevant.  Showing up. 
[02:53:30]  Oh my God.  Save money for merchandise after the show.  Sure.  Don't put the cart before the horse.  Yeah, yeah.  Exactly.  You're putting the cart before the horse again.  Yeah.  Don't put the empty cart before the horse's ass on stage.  Well, this bus trip apparently is going to happen.  How well it runs, how smoothly.  Retard bus.  How smoothly it runs is to be seen.  Yeah.  Smooth as silk, right, Ken? 
[02:54:00]  I hear ya.  But there is something that's been going on here.  More?  I've overheard something.  More controversy.  More controversy.  Holy shit.  How could there be this much drama for a bus trip?  It's May.  It's not scheduled until September.  Yeah, yeah.  And there's already this much drama?  Yeah.  Oh boy.  Ah.  Well, there are, um, going to be two buses.  First, can we have something like an early morning, ah, wake up kind of music for this? 
[02:54:30]  First, we have the bus of Greg Opie Hughes.  This will be kind of, uh, laid back to say, right?  Chill.  Chill.  Kind of, um, just there for the ride.  Casual conversation.  I'm sure Opie will be in there.  Uh, Kenny.  Kenny's going to be resting. 
[02:55:00]  Mellow, man.  In there.  Mellow.  Maybe, maybe, um, some soft music playing on the bus.  Yeah.  Right?  Yeah.  Hanging out.  Maybe even do some-  Squeeze the orange juice.  Do some, yeah.  Some of that meditation.  Meditation.  Yoga.  Would be good.  Some meditation.  Yeah, some, some juicing going on for some, uh, some veggie drinks.  Yeah.  Things like that.  I think that'd be nice.  That's one bus.  But the controversy is not aboard the Greg Hughes, Greg Opie Hughes bus. 
[02:55:30]  Everybody's okay with the meditation?  Right.  Hmm.  The second bus is the Anthony Cumia bus.  Yeah.  Yeah!  Now this bus is not going to stop partying.  Non-fucking-stop.  I fully intend to be way back into drinking by then.  We're going to have the likes of Troy Kwan on the bus.  I believe Roland, who we know is a party animal. 
[02:56:00]  Yeah!  That's going to be on the bus.  I know E-Rock.  He likes up a good party.  Yeah!  E-Rock.  Uh, Travis, what do you think?  Oh, yeah.  I'll be.  You're going to be hanging out.  And, of course, Sam Roberts, who doesn't drink, get the fuck on the show bus.  Chipper, yeah.  I'll be on that fucking bus.  Yeah, you'll be partying.  You'll be rocking so hard, you'll all be pebbles.  Barely sleeping.  Just hanging out, party.  Maybe some fucking impromptu poker games going on. 
[02:56:30]  Troy will be there.  On the drive down.  Whatever.  Troy's going to be on that bus.  Chip's looking at Troy's dick again.  Weird.  Yeah.  But here's the controversy.  We've been talking about the bitches.  Yeah!  Now, this is a bus.  We're going to be fucking going halfway across the country there, down to Texas.  If it's a bunch of dudes drinking and listening to Andrew WK, it doesn't sound like a fun bus.  It doesn't, right?  No.  Until you add the bitches.  The bitches! 
[02:57:00]  The bitches!  Yeah!  Yeah!  And, of course, we know, with a guy like Troy Kwan, there will be bitches.  He brings the bitches.  One thing I must say, when you look at his Instagram or anything like that, everywhere he goes, bitches.  He's just DJing.  He's just playing the tunes, and some bitch has her finger up his ass.  Doesn't matter, right, literally.  You know?  Fingers up his ass.  Is that a true story?  It is a true story.  Bitches.  That's what I'm saying.  Now, of course, we stop at various cities and towns, and we are a national program. 
[02:57:30]  There will be fans.  If any of these fans are bitches, they're cordially invited to hang out with us for a little bit.  We're not going to be there long, but we'll be there, you know, to hang out.  Well, I overheard something that led me to believe that there could be an issue with the bitches.  What?  I don't know.  Let's just say...  What do you mean?  That someone, and again, this is like the IRS, and the Department of Justice, and the Benghazi fucking shit. 
[02:58:00]  It's all this, who knows who it is, what, where, who signed this, who talked.  If you guys are just partying with each other and no bitches, the meditation actually sounds cooler.  Oh, see?  But I'm hearing.  I'm hearing tell that there has been an effort to kind of keep this bitches thing out of the realm of possibility during this fucking trip. 
[02:58:30]  Someone's trying to curtail the bitches?  No bitches.  And you know what I say?  Fuck that!  Yeah!  Bitches!  Yeah!  Yeah!  I ain't having no fucking homo.  Tony, I can't party with fucking bitches.  Yeah!  Got it?  Faggot!  There will be bitches on the bus. 
[02:59:00]  There will be bitches.  Don't make a fucking maniac out of me.  The guys get bitches.  The guys get bitches.  And that's from Paul Anka.  I ain't gonna fucking...  Them guys down the hall think they're curtailing our bitches?  Uh-oh.  And you know what?  What?  He won't be on the bitches bus.  What?  Nope.  There will be a representative for management on...  No.  Not on my bus.  You won't have it?  Not on my watch.  Oh, no. 
[02:59:30]  Not on my watch.  Why?  You gotta make room for bitches?  I'll cut off your Sherlock nose and shove it up your fucking ass.  Not on my watch.  It's gotta be a married and an unmarried bus.  Yes.  And I'm sorry.  I'm sorry, everybody that's married.  Oh, shit!  Sam Roberts.  I mean, I don't...  I'm okay with it.  Married to professional wrestling.  That's right.  It's his first love.  My first love.  His first love.  Because I don't think anybody with a wife would want their significant other partying  on a bus with...  Bitches. 
[03:00:00]  Exactly.  Exactly.  Let me ask you, who doesn't want bitches, though?  That's a great question.  Obviously, a homo.  Who wouldn't want bitches?  Wait, who's saying no women?  Kenny, is it you, Kenny?  Is it old Chrome Dome?  Is it Kenny?  I plead the fifth.  Oh, that's a very popular thing to do these days.  I know.  That's why I said that.  But you made a statement beforehand.  I know.  Now you're in trouble.  I know.  Because I put the cart before the horse.  Yes, you put the cart before the horse again. 
[03:00:30]  That makes me believe it's not Kenny's role.  It's not Kenny's role.  It's actually Radio Wizard.  Oh.  He's the Radio Wizard.  He's got to be a fruit.  The Radio Wizard.  He don't wear no suits.  Well...  Well, yes, he does.  Oh, God.  Chipper.  Wait, why is he saying no girls?  I would assume it's probably this, again, very overly caustic,  overly cautious liability thing, which I don't even understand. 
[03:01:00]  It's like, if fans are there and they just want to hang out for a little bit  until we fucking were off to the next town, whatever.  No women on the bus.  Bitches.  Fuck that.  Fuck that.  We'll videotape everything.  Even the fucking rancid sex.  Can fans say there are hot bitches that are fans?  Can they get on the bus and come with us to the next stop?  I'm saying yes.  Right now.  Yes, they can.  Yes. 
[03:01:30]  Bitches.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Everybody.  And we're talking about shots of cum in the face.  Yeah.  Right.  For whoever.  For whoever.  But the bitches.  Oh.  I can't believe.  I thought there were no bitches allowed.  Oh, we don't need a...  We don't need bitches.  We don't need bitches on the bus.  Who are these bitches?  Are they signed bitch releases?  And it's not a responsibility once they get to the other city of how they get to where 
[03:02:00]  they're going.  I mean, they're adults, right?  I mean...  They're bitches.  Barely slow the bus down.  You kick them the fuck out and pick up new bitches.  Right?  Right, guys?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Shots.  Shots.  Shots.  Shots.  Shots.  Shots.  Shots.  Shots.  Shots.  Shots.  No bitches.  You know who wouldn't want bitches on a bus?  No. 
[03:02:30]  Who?  A fucking homo.  That's who.  A fucking homo.  Well, we ain't fucking homos.  No.  We like bitches.  Bitches.  Yeah.  Roland, what are you thinking?  Bitches or no bitches?  Step up.  Titties, ass, and booze.  Yes!  Yes!  All right, so E-Rock's on.  There's some controversy on which bus Roland will be. 
[03:03:00]  Ah.  But see, if there's a married and unmarried bus, it's clear that he's on our bus.  Right.  Why?  You would want to be like Mello?  No.  I'll bring booze.  I get company sense booze and everything.  Uh-huh.  He said, though, that he might want, prefer the quieter bus.  But not.  Yeah, you have.  I'll go on the unmarried bus.  I'll tell you one thing, also.  There ain't no fucking enjoying the party and then, oh, I need to go crash out on the  other bus.  If you're fucking in for it, you're in for the long haul.  But as it stands, only Troy and Roland can be on the bus with you guys. 
[03:03:30]  It's Troy, Roland, and Jim.  And the bitches!  And the bitches!  Yeah!  And the bitches!  Four guys and a bunch of things with cunts running up and down the aisle.  That sounds fine to me.  Exactly.  I mean, why are you going to bring a married guy on the bus and ruin the fun for everybody?  Absolutely.  Me, Ant, and Roland can just watch Troy fuck all the hot girls.  Jerk each other off on a cracker. 
[03:04:00]  Oh, I'd be in on that.  We can watch all the girls.  We can watch all the girls look over our shoulder as we're kissing their necks.  What are you looking at?  Nothing.  Oh.  And you know what?  I'll lose out again.  That's also checking for, you know, wedding rings.  Yeah.  That's how you keep management off the bus.  They're all married.  Oh.  Good call.  That's a good little loophole.  Married to the job, right?  Yeah.  It's not to the bitches, I guess.  If we were to get stuck with one person from management, though, who would it be? 
[03:04:30]  If you could choose.  It's obvious.  Yeah, it's right.  I'd have to go with Rob, definitely.  I don't think he's even going.  Really?  Oh.  It's not so obvious, then.  Who would I want from management?  Eric Logan?  Yeah, that's a good choice right there.  From Oprah's management?  Yes.  Who are the choices?  Who's going?  I mean, it would probably be Gary.  Possibly Steve.  That might be it.  Yeah.  Maybe Ross.  Ross has been at our other events.  Yeah.  He's probably the least stiff.  Yeah. 
[03:05:00]  I think Gary would just curl up like a cat in the luggage rack and doze off.  I can picture him just sleeping.  Yeah, but it'd be great to get Gary on your bus and then make him party.  He's not into it.  It's just, there's no party there.  No.  No?  No.  There would be this underlying, I'm watching for any problems thing.  We're having a good time.  I don't need someone.  Yeah.  We're having some fun.  We could have some fun, guys.  We could let our hair down.  Oh, well.  But we could, like, you know.  Have some fun.  And then, and then, and then, well, not that kind of fun. 
[03:05:30]  Something happens.  Look, he glares out of the corner of his eye, just looking at you, like.  You're like, oh, fuck.  Oh, and listening to the bitches talk, like, fucking, who's that guy?  He's creeping me out.  He's looking at me.  Who's dad's here?  Yeah, right?  Who's fucking this whole thing up?  I've seen that guy in the movies.  Isn't that Nosfer, Nosfer Toe or something?  They get the vibe that he didn't want the bitches there in the first place.  Right, right.  They pick up the vibe. 
[03:06:00]  He's cock blocking us just by being there.  Yeah.  So he's not invited, you guys are saying?  We don't need that on our bus, right?  Yeah.  Be like hanging out with the fucking dog from Davy and Goliath.  Yeah.  Just poking his head.  What are you doing with the bitches?  Wait, so the one bus is Ant, Jim, Troy, and Roland.  Yeah.  And then the other bus is Obi, Sam, Travis, Eric, Kenny, management, just everyone.  Yes.  Everyone.  That's right.  Yes.  If they don't want to play the game, sorry. 
[03:06:30]  Yeah, and nobody fucking twisted your guys' arms to get married.  Absolutely.  Bunch of hot girls running around on our bus, perhaps a couple of girls, people aren't quite sure.  Right.  But the price of admission on our bus, the ability to have fun.  Right.  And the ability to not fucking stop other people from having fun.  So that gets you on the bus.  If you can't do that, move it along.  Get your ass out the kitchen.  Next bus down, my friend.  Right.  Right.  There's a whole bunch of no fun going on down there. 
[03:07:00]  No fun over there.  I think Lady Di should be on your bus.  She likes to have fun.  She's not married.  Yeah, she's not married and she likes to have fun.  And she's a bitch.  Yeah.  Fuck that.  That is not what I mean.  We could charge admission to see her.  We could put up a sign that says, for 25 cents, meet the talking slug lady.  I'm not a slug lady.  Oh, of course you're not.  That would be a great way to turn it around, though.  To be like, okay, well, there's a whole bunch of freaks that listen to this show that are not married.  They're all going on your bus. 
[03:07:30]  Oh, boy.  No.  No.  There's got to be a rule.  No dude.  No dude fans.  Yeah.  What the fuck?  No dude fans.  That's because the whole entire...  No dude fans.  Everybody would be on the fucking bus.  No.  No dude fans on the bus.  Just bitches.  Yeah, you guys got to take Bobo.  No.  Oh, no way.  He likes to party.  No way.  So the only men on your bus would be the four of you.  Yep.  Right.  That sounds great.  It is.  It's perfect.  It's perfect.  All right.  And the bitches.  That's right.  Plenty of bitches. 
[03:08:00]  Now, I thought bitches were not allowed.  Ah.  Only if you're a homo.  If that moe down the hall wants to quay off and queeb with his friends, that's one thing.  Ain't happening on my watch.  Ain't happening on my watch.  I'll cut your fucking uncircumcised cock off and stick it up your nose.  That's right.  Come on, guys.  We can all just hang out and talk and turtle wax our heads.  Right.  Ain't gonna happen.  Not on the bitch bus.  So all the queered out is gonna happen on my no fun bus? 
[03:08:30]  You quay, queeb, and mow off all you want on your homo bus.  But me?  The Queer Bait Express?  Me?  It's all about the bitches!  How many bitches are you gonna try to have on your bus?  At which stop?  Now, are you in charge of the bitches, Troy?  I mean, Anthony, am I officially in charge of the bitcher?  You could be in charge of the bitches.  You could be in charge of the bitches.  I would say a minimum of four bitches, because there's four guys.  We don't need any hard feelings. 
[03:09:00]  Right.  And we don't need any, you know, any fucking major competition going on.  Yeah, what if all of a sudden Troy is with two girls?  Then we need five bitches.  That's not gonna happen.  Yeah.  Then we'll need five bitches.  No fatties!  Of course, the host would be, obviously, their first taken care of.  No big fatties!  No, I don't need any fucking sympathy or charity.  No, I do.  I'll be fine.  No big fatties.  You don't want fatties?  No, none of you fucking fat message board girls. 
[03:09:30]  What if she wants to show her big fat tits and wants to stick your dick between them?  Then show them outside the bus.  Yeah?  Show your fat, dumb message board girl tits outside the bus.  And then beat it.  Fan elephants.  Sometimes fat chicks are fun.  Fat chicks give more.  Some fat chicks.  I think the priority should be on making sure that Roland gets some bitches.  I think it depends on where we are in the country, too.  The further south we go, I think the more acceptable fat girls are.  Some of them corn-fed bitches?  Yeah, some of them corn-fed bitches. 
[03:10:00]  Yeah.  They got a cute southern accent?  I mean, it's like...  There you go.  Oh my god.  Well, yeah, yeah, shit like that.  I've been waiting for y'all to come down.  All right, Porky.  Eat this.  It's on.  Good.  It's on.  Yeah, but what about the no bitches rule?  I don't know who made that.  That's how you say Gary.  Exactly.  Well, I don't know.  You know, it's fucking...  No, I'm saying, like, I don't know.  If he made it, he doesn't have that say.  Did old Oscar Mayer truck head make that rule? 
[03:10:30]  Yes, old Torpedo Dome.  Excuse me, rivet skull.  I want to talk to you for just a second.  Yes, he did say that, and yeah, well, the bitches are on.  Oh, great.  We're going to have him on the bus.  I don't fucking care.  What do you think?  What do you think I'm signing on for?  A homo bus tour?  That wasn't part of the deal initially, anyway. 
[03:11:00]  No.  Mm-mm.  No, these aren't, like, pink, frilly, sequined, liberacee buses.  Yeah.  This is the type of bus you pull up, and some bitches will be like, I want to be on that  bus.  Yeah, it'll be rock.  A girl's going to be looking, going, I wonder what's going on in there.  But there's a party fucking going on in there.  Music's going to be bumping.  Yeah, yeah.  Lots of songs with N-words in them.  Oh, fuck yeah.  Get some drink going.  Yeah, we got some bitches on the bus, nigga. 
[03:11:30]  We're going to get more bitches on the bus, nigga.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I'm telling you, man.  Are you going to be DJing on your bus?  Oh, yeah.  Absolutely.  Good.  There's a guy with a chrome dome.  He's on Obie's bus, nigga.  He's on a, keep him on Obie's bus, nigga.  He's not invited onto your bus?  Oh.  Fuck it.  Can we Skype in to watch the party?  That's a good question.  Maybe select scenes.  Okay.  Oh.  Yeah.  I'd rather not.  Should I have a sign like that for fucking kids that are too small at rides? 
[03:12:00]  You have to be this fun to enter bus.  You have to be this married?  Yeah.  Yeah.  And the theme song can be the Rod Stewart.  Rod Stewart, we're having a party on the radio.  I don't think so.  Yeah.  Maybe Jim will be on actually my bus.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I think maybe we're losing Jim now.  What the fuck?  You don't think that should be the theme song?  I don't think so.  Yeah.  I'm thinking, um, I'm thinking some 80s hairband rock too.  Tour bus thing. 
[03:12:30]  Very Motley Crue-ish.  Are you going to get a pole on the bus?  Oh, man.  Well, there's a little pole that they got to turn, you know, when you're holding the  little thing when you get on the bus?  Oh, yeah.  They could just dance on that.  Exactly.  You can get portable poles, though.  You know that, right?  Yeah.  Oh, man.  For bitches.  For bitches.  No men on the poles, right?  There's a liability of trouble.  This is too heavy.  I know what we can do.  We can dub in some fun words to other songs.  Yeah?  Like, we get to turn this.  This is not appropriate.  Oh, you don't turn?  No.  We could do something like we'll put in the word fun for cry. 
[03:13:00]  Or, no, we could, like, laugh instead of cry.  Uh-huh.  So, like, we play, it's my party and I'll laugh if I want to.  Are we just going to...  I don't know why.  You don't think that's a good idea?  We're trying to talk about the bus tour.  Roland.  Laugh me a river?  Oh.  Jesus.  It's going to be a party song.  Oh.  Excuse me.  Yeah, you're ruining it.  Exactly.  Oh, my God.  Well... 
[03:13:30]  I'm glad you got to the bottom of that.  So am I, because this is going to happen.  It's our bus.  It's our party bus.  Wow.  All the way...  You think I'm going to fucking Austin, Texas with just a bunch of dudes?  That's confirmed bitches, then.  The fuck is that about?  Who would even think that?  Fuck that.  That single guys...  Yeah.  ...are going to go all the way to Austin on a bus?  I never would have agreed to that shit unless there were bitches.  Right. 
[03:14:00]  And then he wants to shut it down.  No.  None of these bitches.  We can't have bitches.  No, I don't.  No, no, no, no, no.  Why wouldn't he...  What's the reason for no bitches?  What would be the reason?  What is the logical reason that he would come in and say,  Well, you know, you've been talking about the bitches, but here's why we can't have bitches.  I honestly know why.  Because I can't fuck them.  Yeah.  And I don't want to want you to actually...  Really?  Well, he wants to break out.  He hasn't...  He's embarrassed.  Oh.  He has a brand new Herb Tarlick hairpiece. 
[03:14:30]  Oh.  That he wants to show people.  That'd be good.  Looks like Herb Tarlick.  I had nothing there.  I love how scared everybody gets.  They check their emails and phones every two seconds now.  Everyone in here is going,  Oh, did I get a message from...  Well, we're not there.  We're not on this bus tour to play.  I'm just super glad that...  Yeah, we are.  You know, we're there to work.  We play because the play makes the stories for the work.  You gotta live a life. 
[03:15:00]  We're out there to find America's story.  America's story is called Bitches.  Oh, that's right.  Yes.  I'm just psyched that he never told me no bitches.  So I'm not...  I mean...  Never told me.  That's true you can have bitches.  I'm not in trouble on this one.  I will not be undermined...  For once.  ...by some homo telling me I can't fucking have bitches.  Is that what you think it is?  Yeah.  Homo thing?  Yeah.  It's gotta be.  It's gotta be, right?  Why else would you not want to have bitches on a bus?  Maybe you didn't want a distraction for you guys.  Yeah, well... 
[03:15:30]  We'll be distracted by not having no bitches.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, it gets worse.  More of Opie and Anthony's worst of 2013.  Worst of 2013.  Coming up.  Opie and Anthony's worst of 2013.  Continues right now.  Hit it now.  Now.  Hello there.  My name is E-Rock.  E-Rock Radio on Twitter.  And I'm hosting the worst of 2013 for the Opie and Anthony show.  At ONA show on Twitter. 
[03:16:00]  You can see all the shit that we talk about on a daily basis.  Anyway.  Worst of 2013.  Looking back at all the stuff that we did this year.  And this was an amazing year for our pal, comedian Robert Kelly.  Host of the You Know What Dude podcast.  Heard on the weekends here on the Opie and Anthony channel.  This was a great year for Bobby and his family.  Because Bobby had his very first child.  And this is a composite of everything that Bobby had to go through.  From the registry.  To planning and prepping for this kid.  Jumping to the child.  Being born.  And all the stuff that Bobby had to deal with. 
[03:16:30]  After the birth.  Opie and Anthony's worst of 2013.  On the Opie and Anthony channel.  I was singing with Bobby.  Because I see Bobby's got his fucking little registry.  His baby shit up.  His baby registry.  Did you have to pick each of these out individually?  I didn't do one thing.  Or did you just go to one of the packages?  Is there like a baby package thing?  Where like, yeah, we need column A.  They have these people that are at the baby's arrest and shit.  Really?  And they sit down with them.  And they give you a whole fucking list.  This is what you're going to need.  And then they start checking off shit left and right.  So I'm here as a guy that's been through this. 
[03:17:00]  I'm trying to help Bobby.  And I'm X'ing some of this shit off his list.  Yeah.  Yeah.  So you don't need a fucking.  What's the baby formula one?  I told you to get rid of it.  First of all, babies are us in Manhattan.  Yeah.  Okay.  That place is great.  There's a 16-year-old Dominican kid.  Which carriage do we have?  I don't know, man.  Oh, really?  It's like, oh, I'm fucked.  I'm fucked.  Go out to the suburbs.  Yeah.  You have to go to the suburbs.  Get out of the inner city for this shit.  It was so annoying.  You need a little white girl.  I'm going, may I help you? 
[03:17:30]  Exactly.  Aw, that's so sweet.  Here.  Here's some things we got.  This one's good.  You know what?  Like, what happened?  Exactly.  Yeah, I'm going to have a baby.  What happened?  Is he the only carriage you have right here?  Yeah.  I don't know.  There's a stroller.  And then there's a, we need a crib.  Do you have any more in the back?  Do you have any more of these in the back?  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  Look, I'm going on my break.  You're going to have to get somebody else. 
[03:18:00]  Before you go.  All right.  Can you show me somebody else?  Yeah.  Just wait here and someone will help you.  God.  Yeah.  Five hours later.  Yeah.  They're not very helpful.  Five hours later, it comes back up.  Sorry.  I said, I'm trying to get a crib that can hold two people.  What's the weight restriction?  You're looking for.  Hilarious.  If Uncle Paul is working at Baby's R Us, put them in the crib and leave them there for  a half hour.  You're looking for a crib that holds 209 pounds. 
[03:18:30]  Yeah.  I'm looking for a crib that won't break under duress.  You know what I mean?  I'm looking for a crib that can withstand a lot of rockin'.  Jesus.  That's funny, man.  I want a crib with a tent over the top.  Yeah.  I want a crib with one-way mirrors fencing out so we can see who's coming.  Who's going to buy all this shit for you?  You got to buy some of this shit?  I think it's me.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't understand this concept either, where you throw this out there to the world, your 
[03:19:00]  friends and family, and they go buy this shit.  That's why she was writing the-  Takes a village, Bobby.  That's why.  When she was writing the description, she was like, hey, guys, thanks for checking out  our registry.  I really appreciate it.  And I was like, no.  If you're going to do this, make them buy some shit.  Yeah.  Like, have our friends and family buy-  Like, real stuff.  Aren't you having a baby shower?  She's having one in Boston.  All right.  So she'll get most of this shit.  She'll get all the cheap shit. 
[03:19:30]  Yeah.  Yeah.  That's what I-  She's going to get the onesies.  I've never saddled anyone with wedding stuff or baby shit.  Why can't I just have a me registry?  Hey, everyone.  Here's some shit I'd like.  They do have that.  How about you just buy it for me?  They have that.  You're fucking tranny escorts.  What is that?  It's a wish list.  It's a wish list.  Everyone has a wish list.  Yeah.  A lot of porn.  A lot of escorts.  Escorts have wish lists.  Yeah.  Yeah.  You go to Amazon.  You can buy them a fucking-  Yeah.  For our wish list, it's a picture of her and her father hugging.  My wish list was destroyed in 1865. 
[03:20:00]  Wait.  That's how they get away with shit?  No.  That's just one of the ways you can get gifts.  Oh, wow.  Fucking Anthony.  That's terrible.  God.  I like bringing a little historical humor into the program.  You're fucking awesome.  You're brilliant.  Oh, boy.  I don't know.  What's your number one thing on here, Bobby?  What's like your go-to?  If we got this, I'd be fucking happy.  Well-  Stroller, obviously. 
[03:20:30]  Is it the stroller?  Yeah, the stroller.  500 beaners.  The stroller's good.  500 beaners.  That's not the one I wanted, but-  No, no.  That's not the magical remote control one.  That looks like a shitty stroller.  Let's take a look at that one for you.  Oh, he winced.  This is actually a good one.  I gave him a quick thumbs up and he winced.  Why is that good?  I don't know.  Yeah, it's one click.  It goes down.  It goes up.  It's light.  It goes all around.  That thing comes down again.  So for the sun, it's got a little thing over here you can see through. 
[03:21:00]  You can pick this up.  One click and it comes up and you can turn it.  God, you love your gadgets too.  Yeah.  Mama's and Papa's Herbo stroller.  Well, the one I picked.  Yeah, the one I wanted.  It's like you said-  What, do you want the Mama Cass one?  You said this a couple weeks ago.  Picking out a stroller is like picking out a car.  It's a nightmare.  Yeah.  It's a fucking nightmare.  Give me a stroller.  She was on the-  I had to take over because she was doing-  She had like 15 of them up for like three days in a row.  And I just go, what does this do? 
[03:21:30]  What does that do?  Show me this.  And then I-  All right, that one's better than that.  All right, this is the fucking stroller we're getting.  Fuck you.  Put it up on the registry.  Yeah.  She was going nuts.  But the one I wanted was that push.  Yeah.  The push button one.  That's fucking-  That looks pretty badass.  They do the same thing with these fucking strollers they do with cars and phones.  Is they could make a perfect stroller that you can use for a couple years.  It could be lightweight.  It could have-  And they don't.  They got to take away one option. 
[03:22:00]  So you're like, oh, it has everything, but it doesn't-  It's only-  You think they're all in cahoots?  It's like, fuck, just make the fucking stroller one.  Yeah.  That, you know-  Does everything.  Has everything.  Why do I-  It's like cars.  Why do I-  The DL, the XE, the ES.  Fuck you.  Give me a Civic with everything.  Who fucking knew that?  Yeah.  Does that thing break down real quick?  Like when you see a parent with the fucking stroller and they go-  And it's just like, all of a sudden like the Jetsons car.  It's in his little suitcase.  Yeah.  It's not the-  Yeah. 
[03:22:30]  It's not the one button push.  No.  It made it easier to be a parent.  When we were growing up, fuck that.  Oh my God.  The rickety fucking strollers that-  Everything was a hazard.  The big huge wheels.  That.  They brought a fucking playpen to my grandma's house that I could have been choked in.  Right.  Like everything was a fucking hazard.  Yeah.  No one was-  No one was watching over this shit.  No.  Some guy invented something.  They just threw it out on the market.  Yeah.  Let's see how it works.  We'll test it in the field.  One of the things we bought was we had to send it back because it gets mulled.  It gets mulled? 
[03:23:00]  Yeah, it gets mulled.  Right here.  Look at this one.  You got the video?  This is it right here.  Strollers are all the same, it says.  And haven't changed in decades.  In decades.  Except for this.  For now, right?  Look at this fucking thing.  Watch this fucking thing.  This bitch is-  Until now.  Oh, shit.  She's turning a knob.  It's lighting up like the future.  Holy shit!  Dude, that is cool!  Oh, wow.  All right.  That is great.  All right, dude.  Until she hits it the other way when the baby is spillover and fucking crushes the kid.  Just fold the baby.  Look at the lights on it and shit.  Why is Bobby dancing? 
[03:23:30]  Bobby's dancing to the stroller video.  It's like the father of fame.  Your life just got sad.  Look at the lights.  Daytime running lights.  Pathway lights.  Charges itself while you walk, motherfucker.  It's got a generator on it.  Suspension.  Suspension.  Bobby, you want that?  Lots of storage.  Watch this.  And it knows when you-  LCD dashboard.  It knows when you're the kid in there?  It knows when the baby's in there and won't fold.  Oh, really?  Your iPhone.  Charged your iPhone.  Plugs in.  Holy shit.  I want this music, too, while I'm walking on the street with my baby.  You could say hi. 
[03:24:00]  Yeah.  Comes with the kid, too.  Yeah, sure.  Amazing.  Different colored fucking-  Backgrounds.  Here we go.  Watch this.  Little seats.  Let's go inside for a second.  Ow!  Yeah, I'm guaranteeing it gets folded up, fall fucked up.  Of course.  It never works that way.  Dude, that's amazing.  That's how it's not.  You want that, Bobby?  How much is it?  I would love that.  It's a thousand.  Good luck.  But here's the thing.  This is why you can't get-  You can only-  It only-  What?  It's an origami.  It only lasts for like a year and a half, or two years. 
[03:24:30]  And then you're done.  Because, you know, these have certain weight limits.  And as the kid gets older, wait for it.  Wait for it.  No, we're just smiling.  Tonight.  We were just smiling that time.  That time we were just smiling when you said wait.  We were just smiling.  Badass.  It's a badass fucking-  Two years is a long time with one stroller, though.  Because they'll have new shit.  If I rolled out with that thing, and I pushed a button, get it.  You pushed a button, people just like, whoa!  Dog shit.  But you need that music with the carriage. 
[03:25:00]  Yeah, you need that fucking-  Yeah.  That was some hot music.  Pretty fucking good, man.  Look at that hot chick, too.  Can I tell you something, though?  What's up, son?  You rarely fold your stroller, so-  Oh, really?  It's cool as shit, but you rarely fold it.  Look at that dashboard.  I would, though, because it has a dashboard.  Of course.  Yeah, look at-  Fucking-  That's pretty fucking cool.  Tells you how everything's working.  Look at that, dude.  Are you operational?  Right.  The car seat goes right in there.  Oh, right in there.  Sure it does.  Ba-boom.  Ba-da-dang.  What color?  What color?  Can we hear the music again?  Oh, fucking great.  What color are you picking out? 
[03:25:30]  Yeah.  Look at Bobby.  Fuck.  Yeah.  I didn't know how to dance like that.  That's a little strange.  I do.  I have fucking hockey.  That's a little strange, man.  I have gay man in me.  It folds up like the Lunar Rover.  That's pretty cool.  Good to see me at weddings.  I am.  Yeah.  I'm digging it.  Yeah.  I like this music.  Is that cup holder on there? 
[03:26:00]  Yeah, the cup holder's on there, too.  They don't sell this in New York, though.  No, you got to order it.  No, you can get this at Babies R Us.  No, you can't.  No, you can't.  No.  I just, no, I just, Jeff, this is on Babies R Us page.  Damn it!  I would love you to get that, and like, when you have the first day you get it, you roll  it through like a fucking, a giant log.  Like a, two wheels through the log.  The whole left, both left wheels through a fucking giant, like, a giant, like, fucking  mastiff log.  And then he folds it up and it smears all over everything. 
[03:26:30]  Gets it on his hands.  Oh, God.  Into the crevices.  Yes.  He has to take out toothpicks to clean up his nice stroller.  It smells like dog shit the fucking first day you get it.  It smells like new plastic and dog shit.  It sucks.  I would roll.  And it's got like fucking leaves matted into it.  Oh, man.  I love how descriptive Jimmy gets.  Oh, yeah.  I would love a nice dog log.  A fucking cigarette butt.  I haven't slept since the baby was born.  And it's, it's fucking maddening.  Well, you, yeah, but you know what it is.  At least, you and, you and your wife made a choice to have a kid. 
[03:27:00]  You wanted one.  It's not like it was a mistake.  Like, and this is so, it's for you.  It's like, this is what you wanted.  It is what you want, but you don't really, you don't know, you think you know, but you  really don't know.  And everybody tells you, a million people tell you, get your sleep, get your sleep, but you're  not really listening.  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  And then once it happens, and they go, okay, goodbye, and you're out, you're in a cab or  fucking going home, and you're at your house with this, all of a sudden your life is just 
[03:27:30]  different, and there's no, there's no fucking changing it.  It's not like when someone comes and visits, like your mom, you know she's leaving Tuesday.  Your life is going to suck for four days, but she's gone Tuesday, and you're right back.  Like, it's never going back, ever.  Right now you have a visitor until at least 2034.  Yeah.  But your baby is very, I went and saw them in the hospital, and the baby is fucking adorable.  What a cute baby.  How long ago did you have the baby now? 
[03:28:00]  It's a week Sunday.  Her, this past Sunday, right?  Yeah, this past Sunday, it's been a week.  And he, yeah, her water broke Friday after I did spots at the cellar.  I just took a hot one at the Nuke Village Underground.  Oh, you didn't do well?  Oh, man, I just took a hot one.  Yeah, I was so miserable.  I would get home, and I just was glad the day was over.  Good night, good night, and then my water broke.  She was like, my water broke.  And then that's-  Was it on time?  Like, were you expecting it?  He came on his due date. 
[03:28:30]  Wow.  And that's like 4%.  So were you-  On the day?  He came on his day.  So when you were performing, were you thinking about it?  No, because everybody said, even the doctor, that it's not going to happen on his due date.  It's going to be probably a few days after, or maybe a week after.  So we were, like, walking around, and, you know, they said walk and have sex.  You know, you're supposed to have sex, too, because-  Yeah.  Oh, easy, Chip.  Yeah, because I guess when, you know, it opens up the fucking- 
[03:29:00]  It loosens the cervix or some shit.  Nice.  But, yeah, the water breaking, it's not water.  It's disgusting.  It's the consistency of Perel hand lotion.  Okay.  It's like mucus membrane?  No, it's clear, but it's creamy.  Right, Trav?  Did you-  Did her-  Her water didn't break?  She was induced.  She was what?  Induced.  My induced.  I don't even hear you, Travis.  Induced.  She was, like, a week late, I guess.  A week late. 
[03:29:30]  So they just scheduled a-  Yeah, there's a little-  It's called a mucus plug that holds all the water in, and that fucking popped.  Is that what the water breaking is?  It's a plug?  It's a plug.  It's a mucus.  It's a white thing that holds all the water in through.  And once the cervix loosens up, that pops out, and I saw a little piece of it on the floor.  That was gross.  It was disgusting, because it was, like, you know, thinking you're drinking milk, and  it's orange juice.  I thought it was going to be water. 
[03:30:00]  The thing is that people, they just use these words, and they never explain, hey, dude,  it's kind of creamy.  Slime.  Yeah, it's slimy.  Your slime broke.  It's like Nickelodeon Award.  Right, right.  Like, Don's ass and pussy just won a Nickelodeon Award.  the movies kind of change things oh they fucking suck it's not water breaks baby comes out no it's  not it's water breaks you panic forget everything you learned you have to fucking clean i used every  towel on the house to clean it up with my foot because i wasn't touching it were you in bed when

[03:34:00]  you are yeah you just i you just want to you almost want to just go to a private hospital private car  but i it's new york so i got to do all this shit and you get very vulnerable and then you get up  there and the doctor comes in i gotta page the doctor and i'm like sorry for waking you  that that's what she does i mean she's on call you know but i'm like i it's not like she's at home  and you you woke her up and you gotta look at the stuff she's like is there any color in it does it  have a smell you really gotta man up at that point and be like no and and then we get up there and

[03:38:30]  it's like why though there's no it's so silly it's stupid you're like i have a giant needle that can  make you feel really good why don't you just take it yeah it's still coming out yeah they they just  want to do it the way they did it for thousands of years they want to do it just so they could say  i had it natural yeah they want to be better than and yeah well go do it in the fucking park then  do it the real way exactly go give it go give dirt babies yeah stand up like they do in africa  drop it into someone's hands tough guy yeah exactly so uh this guy comes in and she's in so 
[03:39:00]  much fucking pain it's like holy shit you don't know what to do then this guy comes in finally  she's shaking and they're putting a needle in your chick's spinal cord and i went to look and the  doctor actually went no no no i've you can't do that you i've seen many husbands pass out by looking  with that does it really hurt the needle or there's such other no because they they it's it's  huge dude it's fucking huge and but they they you know they know they numb the whole area first so 
[03:39:30]  she feels it but it's pressure it's not like something's in my someone just stabbed me in the  spine but as soon as that happens it's okay everything becomes okay again did it take it doesn't  take sometimes no uh lisa it only took half her body like she could still feel oh god and they can't  do it again right now why it's too much i think it's too much yeah oh my god so half her body was  fucking hurting yeah she didn't she didn't get the whole thing oh my god dude i know it they they 
[03:40:00]  keep checking on that they're like how where do you feel this you should feel it on the left  you should feel this on the right and they but it's it's like yeah it's like it's weird because  it's not it he doesn't come in and go from it takes a long time for them to get it exactly right  so that's crazy that she felt half of it holy you mean like like like her left side of her body  like her left leg and left arm were fine she could tell that it wasn't working like it should  be working oh yeah that's scary too yeah because it's kind of like oh here's a carrot oh yeah i'm 
[03:40:30]  just kidding she had like a tylenol or something right trev yeah chip that's how it works no i know  a girl my uh my wife's friend they actually gave her too much and she couldn't feel her legs for like  a week she had to stay in the hospital she was basically paralyzed for a week did they hit the  wrong spot or was it just too much they probably hit the wrong spot they they fucked up it's probably  another reason why some people like natural childbirths to try i mean it's still well shoving  a needle into your spine it's still a risky thing yeah yeah absolutely it's fucking crazy risky and i 
[03:41:00]  had i had the uh the shadower you know when you're at fucking applebee's and the real waiter comes over  and he has some other fucking nervous nelly with only one fucking flare on his suspense i had that  guy come in and then he does it now your wife's literally fucking losing her mind for hours like  maybe a couple hours she's in the worst pain she's ever felt she you know her tits hanging out her box  is hanging out it look and her box looks like rocky's mouth in rocky three you know because doctors 
[03:41:30]  have just been sticking arms up it for fucking hours and this doctor comes in dude kind of good  looking dude whatever he's got some fucking you know lance armstrong bracelets on so you know he does  some type of workout regimen and then he's leaving he looks at me he goes hey comedy cellar i was like  oh jesus fuck me yeah i'll give you free tickets if you don't tell people that you saw my wife's box  on facebook and don't don't fucking snap iphone shots of it yeah and then uh and then after that  happens she goes to bed and then the doctors just keep and you're in this chair and it cranks back and 
[03:42:00]  you go to sleep and you're fucking on your ipad and you and then she uh you keep coming in and  checking her cervix they keep coming in you don't want to look at that shit too they have  pretty much a what is it like a diaper under her the bed is like a big diaper and they just keep  ripping it off and throwing a new one on why because she's leaking well there they go inside of her and  there's shit i mean the there's there's stuff coming out of her yeah once you have the epidural 
[03:42:30]  like you can't move like you've like she's got to go to the bathroom right there you know like you can't  get out of that bed yeah she's got a shit in the bed yeah if she has to well smell it you not even  realize it's happening no she didn't my wife didn't shit thank fucking god that would bother  dude if i saw my wife shit i i don't know if they'd be i don't know if we'd come home from that  i get fucked up when there's a little fucking stain on the toilet that she doesn't fucking  you know what i mean like i know it's not my shit nugget that it's like she took like a just a 
[03:43:00]  dark dehydrated shit and there's a little tiny spot in the toilet i'm like clean that the fuck  up you don't like would you would you be grossed out if you came in and it was all spray on the  back and you lift the toilet seat it was one of those oh yeah if my if don i i didn't look at any  of that i just occasionally look it was at three in the morning she comes in she goes uh she checks  you're 10 centimeters this is happening lights go on so that's like about 12 hours after you got there 
[03:43:30]  yeah the second time the second time and then she goes all right let's do a test push  and she goes all right you grab this leg and i had to grab her other leg and  she has to kind of hell i have to hold the back of her head and she kind of curls her body around  the baby and dawn i don't know if she's just a tough broad from boston but she goes all right just  push you know on the for 10 she goes one two oh the doctor's like i i feel the head i feel it's  coming and she just panicked she's like because you didn't think it was happening that quick 
[03:44:00]  and fucking i don't know 20 minutes later the baby's on her chest i have you want to see  i saw the video yeah it's it's here's the thing though you think you're gonna be i did tear up she  teared up you tear up but you're in shock it's not you you want it to be like the movies like we did  we made the baby yeah we did the baby like you're connected to it a hundred percent but you're not  because a human being just came out of your wife's vagina and it kind of looks like you two 
[03:44:30]  and you're like what the you're in shock even dawn was in shock you can see in that video she's like  oh my god she's trying to figure out what the fuck just happened and this thing is going and it's  like wow so what so you your first thought when the baby pops up is like oh my it's you don't have  a thought it's you're trying to have a you're trying to connect you're trying to have that  moment you're trying at least i was i was trying to make a i feel like a serial killer who fell in 
[03:45:00]  love you know what i mean but couldn't couldn't connect you knew what the feelings were but you  couldn't find them or feel them yeah you knew what the i knew the feelings i was supposed to have  but it was so oh my god overwhelming that i couldn't get on and then all of a sudden you do  connect it's like oh my god there it is and you feel it and then you start to cry and then it just  cuts off because somebody does something or says something and and i cut the cord too which wasn't  even that bad people made it's like calamari it's fucking if you're not looking if you're not looking 
[03:45:30]  if you don't look at an umbilical cord that's connected to the baby and then coming out of your  vagina if you don't see the two ends and you just see that part it's bah fuck it yeah so wait  let's have some squid you pick the baby up they wipe it how long when do they pick it up  no no but when they don't they don't wipe it off they leave a lot of that the white stuff is like  cream it's actually good for the baby it's like the most it's the best like skin cream ever apparently 
[03:46:00]  but uh they leave the baby they leave it on the baby and you just did you kiss the baby with it on  there no not me i'd throw up on the baby's fucking fucking get a blood nugget on my fucking  accidentally fucking snort in it go in like spaghetti in my nose and come out the back of  my throat don't they wipe his face off a little something they know they do wipe it off and they  clean it clean his mouth and they you know they and it's so they're so fucking it looks like they're  being rough with the kid but they know exactly how rough to be you can be with a newborn to not 
[03:46:30]  break it yeah but like you know they just fucking grab it suck all the stuff out of its mouth it's  crying what do they what do they use a suction thing to pull the gunk out you feel bad because  he's just shaking yeah because he was in a warm you know womb for nine months and now he's just  out in an ac fucking shitty new york hospital fucking just shaking on some nervous chick's tit  yeah it really is a tremendous reality switch it's the first time you see everyone 
[03:47:00]  it's it's fucking nuts do they spank him or no like they smack him to make him breathe no they  don't do that no he's breathing he comes out he's i actually i looked down at one point  i i she didn't want me looking too but at one point when she said the head's out i looked and i saw  it was you know my kids got a lot of hair too yeah yeah yeah i saw his head and it was kind of smushed  like you know i didn't know this a woman's tailbone and i think some other the front i don't know 
[03:47:30]  try me you can help me out but they they unhook they unhinge like a woman's they unhook a snake  mouth something like that like something happens to a woman's body where the bones kind of unhinge  and the baby's head that's why it's as the soft spot it kind of smushes to come out and the doctor  turns it in a certain way so you know it's fucking crazy how this shit just works and the baby comes 
[03:48:00]  out and i saw the little smushed head coming out of a vagina but the perspective was from the top so  it wasn't direct on looking at a pussy and an asshole with a head coming out of it yeah it was just it  just saw a head coming out of oh it's crazy i'm shocked that someone like you who gets so grossed  out so easily would even think about looking i that when she's i couldn't help it she said  the head is out and i just went oh my god i have to see this and i looked instinct it was just  instinct and i looked and there was no blood there was no nothing um at that angle that's what i mean 
[03:48:30]  like if i was looking straight on and i saw the you know the puddle of guck under it and just you  know fucking dragon snort coming out of my wife's pussy i would have thrown up but you know it's just  that angle and then and then they put it on your wife and she's crying and it's you could see it hit her  you can see the it fucking it you know her breakdown like it's her start to connect to  this kid and then all of a sudden she's holding this kid and it's quiet and it's just looking up 
[03:49:00]  at him and you're like holy fuck and you're just a bystander at that but you're just like what the  fuck yeah and then they uh and then they clean them off a little bit and then they do all this shit  they just do shit to him right away they suck they use a suction thing to pull stuff out of his nose  and mouth a nose and mouth yeah yeah he's been in water for nine months how long after he was like  out until you held him um minutes oh right after yeah minutes they i cut the cord um and then she 
[03:49:30]  they do a little surgery on the cord which is fucking disgusting when it comes back it just looks like a  hole in your baby's belly um and then uh he's got that big belly button you know it's on it it's just  an outie it looks like you know like a prisoner's belly button yeah and then uh and then you held  them you they wrap them they swaddle them and that's when you all of a sudden that's from that  moment that you you start learning what's swaddling mean swaddling means i want to do it to you 
[03:50:00]  that's the way you should be tucked in every night just swaddled does that mean when they wrap  them tight it's a certain way of wrapping the baby that he feels like he's in the womb again it  it helps them chill the fuck out because he's tight his arms are tight it protects him from his  own arms and it also when they sleep a lot of babies die not a lot of sids you know yeah they  die because the they roll over their face gets in a blanket and they just fucking die so you have to  keep them kind of tight against themselves so they don't roll over and fucking mush their face and 
[03:50:30]  mouth into a and they don't know how to turn over at that age right um no but they fucker they just  kick and move and like if you watch my kitty you know when he's waking up he's just kicking and  moving his little nails yeah he's got a little he's got fucking edgar nails my fucker i made her  file him down immediately um but and then they take you uh okay and they take you over to your room  and she's you her and the baby you sit in this room with this fucking baby in the did you get a 
[03:51:00]  private room you know we were gonna and i told her i go look we'll get the private room it's a  thousand dollars a night cash yeah i mean cash it's not covered it's not covered and you can't  like bill me later like no want the money straight up you have to you have to as soon as you have the  baby the doctor goes okay you know a little bit after goes okay we can send you down now to get a  private room if you want to go you have to sign up for it and if it's available yeah they've only got a 
[03:51:30]  couple they only got a couple and if it's available and you have you have the money you do it i told  donna go why don't we just do that she goes i don't want it i don't want the private room uh it's  it's fucking a waste of money it's i think it's bullshit how much money it is certain hospitals like  five bills which is kind of reasonable yeah five hundred thousand dollars a night it's like what  is there a fucking am i getting a hand job you know yeah it's like fucking jesus 
[03:52:00]  why why why interject that but she she goes plus when you get you i get to stay over all night  in a private room and she was like i i think i need you to go home get sleep walk the dogs and i  want to they take the baby at night in the nursery when you're in a a regular room they'll take the  baby they they would do it in the private room too but they take the baby and they give her a rest too  so and i if you have a baby and you can get afford a private room i would never not get it again i 
[03:52:30]  mean i would never do a shared room again it was a fucking pain in the ass the lady on this side  had the control of the heat and it was hot as fuck because she was some from fucking some hot country  and i'm dying i told you to get a private room i know and i she didn't want money i ever spent she  didn't fucking want it i told her to i actually i had the money i saved like this is the money for  the private room she's like i don't want it once we found out that we could get the private room for  x amount i don't think it was a thousand dollars because we we went we were out in brooklyn yeah but 
[03:53:00]  yeah best money how many nights do you have to stay one night two nights we were going to say one  because dawn was actually doing great but then she had a i went home and i got a call the next day  and she was she had a breakdown that's when you guys called me it was monday um you know she had  the baby sunday we spent sunday night monday you guys called me and i was on hold and i just hung up  because i got a phone call from her and she was fucking losing her mind she had a like a crazy night 
[03:53:30]  where i it was stupid i wasn't there uh and she had to go out into the nurses she walked out into the  lobby and just started had a breakdown like crying like i don't know what to do like i don't  the baby's crying and i'm trying to feed and she just because she didn't know what the fuck to do  yeah it's like a day in and she's by herself and i i felt terrible and i i just ran up there but all  this is what's great all these nurses surrounded her and hugged her and they were fucking on her 
[03:54:00]  yeah they taught her everything and kind of gave her shit back like her self-esteem like you're gonna  do this and they taught her breastfeeding and swat and they just this there's three things  the kid the kid cries you know i see people like oh come on oh it's okay no asshole he doesn't know  english shit dick he's not trying to get attention you know so you give him you know fucking you know  say nice things to him he's he shit his pants he pissed he's hungry or he needs to be burped 
[03:54:30]  that's pretty much it do you burp him yeah you get a burp doesn't work you feed the abs of fucking  lily you feed him you burp him and you change him that's that's all you do to a kid and as soon as  you do then you get fucked up because you'll feed him and he's crying and then you'll try to burp him  and it doesn't work and then you look and he's got he pissed his pants so it's like fuck but it's  like 20 minutes went by and you're trying to burp him it's like this isn't working and then you look 
[03:55:00]  you just gotta remember those three things and then you go well i always say at the dawn like  what did he piss oh yeah do they cry like it's weird babies cry when they piss or shit like yeah  what a weird instinct that is like they don't know even at that age they don't want to sit in their  own waist there's something about that like why would a kid cry when they're acidic it hurts their skin  oh that's what it is it burns and plus my kid had a circumcision because he's a fucking human  and uh you know his dick is fucking exposed so when he pisses i mean you gotta this is the fucked up 
[03:55:30]  thing is you go you go right from this world that you live in to to rubbing vaseline on a babe a little  tiny asshole and and and kid nuts which are fucking adorable by the way the best nuts ever this little  fucking look like little little tiny fucking will you think it's something okay

[04:07:30]  interrupt nature or nurture yes yes stay tuned for our thrilling chicken versus the egg sequence  that we're nature or nurture nature or nurture yes  do i want to see a cock or do i want to eat a cock ah yes what do you got going on sir  i'm actually calling in hopes of exercising a song from my head that i've not been able to get out 
[04:08:00]  of my head since drunk friday of uh wine over a drug tequila and donut oh tequila and donuts  people still talking about tequila and donut day that iraq came up with he thought it was going to  be a fucking epic fail and it turned out to be one of those moments that you know people are still  talking about cry baby iraq and and people still finding that show and going oh my god i finally  got to listen to that yes what song is in your head because of that i love that uh the listeners are 
[04:08:30]  calling and saying you know or or emailing or whatever you should do this thing more often  i agree you know you shouldn't uh because it was so fucking rare and special the idea that the  notion even that you could do this on a regular basis is insanity it is you're absolutely right  that's no way it could be done yeah no it was insane and unfortunately i've ever since then my  girlfriend i've been walking around the house singing this ridiculous song yeah that i now have  to share with you it's just a line really a song that's a line but it it it reverberates in my head 
[04:09:00]  and i i have to exercise the fucking thing out because it's driving me crazy i'd love to hear  it all right hey slobo drunk fucking donut eater hey slobo that's it that's all i got  slobo see hey iraq you gotta be you gotta admit that it's not that bad now that kevin pollock is  calling you slobo as well it hurt when i started and then it kind of hurt even more when roland

[04:12:00]  i sense in my heart that jimmy means it i do yeah but i think i think opa you'll probably be the  next one to interrupt no no i couldn't do that to you no no because i think it seems like you've got  a nice guy all right here we go oh no oh it's fucking casino he's in casino i know holy shit we 
[04:12:30]  love kevin kevin's great dc improv this weekend how great is that he's walking around singing that  song for you slobo i actually felt bad that i interrupted so i'm like i would love to have  that audio do you understand you rock that kevin pollack is thinking of you somewhere in hollywood  yeah yes that's great that's kind of cool kevin pollack you know it was a guy i was watching  casino the other day and uh he is a good actor man there's one little subtle scene where uh he's 
[04:13:00]  got to sign the paperwork yeah and um i guess the head of the union or whatever the fuck it is  looking over his shoulder yeah uh and he does this look like i like i sign here like i like he  doesn't quite know what he's signing and he's looking it's so subtle and just so fucking well  that's easy to do like this what you like this all right let me see jimmy go here perfect kevin  pollack's back on the line you nailed it kevin yeah no i blame steve jobs that dead fuck for making 
[04:13:30]  the iphone so my ear can hang up on me that's what it was yep that's exactly what happened kevin  and was telling that call back to make sure you guys understood yes i said and turned into some  freak all right and uh i was uh talking about your acting skills yeah i know i love that subtle little  look you give when you're signing the documents and you look up like i sign here kind of a a weird  little uh like facial thing but that was very good you were very fucking good in that in casino 
[04:14:00]  i'm gonna say uh thank you uh i appreciate that very much it's probably because i was scared shitless  being in over my head did you think you were in over your head yeah oh fuck yes that's one of those  jobs that every the first week at least every day you wait for someone to knock on the tread and say  yeah we've made a horrible error oh fuck yeah we we thought it was kevin spacey could you come with  oh fuck some yeah yeah someone else we were looking for oh yeah but no the best part was 
[04:14:30]  rickles but watching rickles go after denaro that that really was the thrill as amazing as it was to  act in the movie and work with scorsese and denaro and all the big shots watching rickles go after  denaro was by far the best and denaro enjoyed it right he loved the shit out of it oh my god he  because it turns out rickles knew that uh denaro had worshipped him since he was a kid  that that part news got to rickles and rickles basically knew he owned denaro yeah where everyone 
[04:15:00]  else you know they they treat him with such reverence on the set it's it's absurd rickles  is just shitting all over him that's great in the middle of a take is that the way you're gonna do  it like that i'm sure you know what you're doing dad with denaro laugh oh i'm sure that huge denaro  mugging laugh oh shit yeah that's great man that's how you're gonna do it i guess you know  all right i guess you know yeah and pesci got mad at him you said right oh pesci was pissed yeah 
[04:15:30]  wow because rickles said he was so short he was gonna ride him on the set like a shetland  in front of 200 people at the wedding scene extras you know and then pesci just didn't  yeah you're a fucking riot rickles now i get it i get it i'm a midget and you're a genius  was it awkward after that what's that was it uh awkward was it awkward or oh yeah no it was  extremely awkward because rickles wouldn't stop so that made it more awkward uh and they wanted to 
[04:16:00]  try to kiss him you know come here joe come here come here joe you know it was just and then you can  see that that pesci really truly did want to rip off his head and shit that was people laughing  everyone was laughing except for joe wow i guess that was awkward as fuck did rickles seem  did rickles seem nervous around denaro no no it was weirdest thing in the world everyone else you  could hear the sphincter titan when he walked by but rickles for some reason he just knew i own 
[04:16:30]  this kid and he was fucking fearless plus i guess after sinatra and being who you are for that like  he was so famous before denaro ever was it's just oh god yes yeah i think that's in a nutshell for  sure there's nothing that frightens him at this point no no he told fucking sinatra to fuck off i  mean yeah wow that's old school yeah yeah exactly nice yeah all right mr pollack uh all right thanks  guys i literally really did just need to get that out man i'm sorry yeah no worries i miss you guys  yeah and that's today's look at the worst of 2013 for the opian anthony show opian anthony will
