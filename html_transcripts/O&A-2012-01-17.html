<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show on January 17th, 2012, began with a recap of their successful "Antisocial" comedy shows in Atlantic City, featuring Jim Norton, David Attell, Doug Stanhope, Artie Lange, and Jim Florentine.  They debated the merits of the Friday and Saturday shows, ultimately deeming Saturday superior.  Norton shared a story about heckling an older woman.  The conversation then turned to Anthony's high-stakes blackjack at the Borgata, contrasting his large bets with Norton's more conservative video poker.  Anthony recounted anecdotes with casino dealers, including a frustrating $12,000 loss, and shared his gambling superstitions.

The hosts then launched into a highly offensive discussion about a cruise ship that ran aground, speculating crudely on the captain's and passengers' actions and comparing it to the Titanic, debating the film's romantic plotline.  They segued into a discussion of John Elway, the Broncos-Patriots game, and Tim Tebow, culminating in an extremely abusive response to a listener's joke about the cruise ship.  They briefly mentioned Kid Rock's and Muhammad Ali's birthdays, and teased an upcoming interview with Gina Carano.

Gina Carano, promoting *Haywire*, was interviewed next.  The hosts showered her with attention, making numerous suggestive comments about her appearance.  They discussed her career transition from MMA fighting to acting, her anxieties about interviews and acting, and anecdotes about dating and wrestling with boyfriends.  The conversation touched on male and female fighting styles, poker, and Carano's discomfort watching herself on film.  Her manager, Jonathan, was the subject of crude jokes about his genitals.  A brief discussion about Socotra Island ensued, followed by a playful mock chokehold with Carano, and ended with praise for her and her film.

The show continued with crude humor about penis size, bath toys, and constipation.  They lamented their perceived unfair treatment compared to podcasters, referencing a "baby bird" gag they felt they were unfairly prohibited from doing.  A significant portion focused on their anger over the lack of a new Opie and Anthony poster in their workplace lobby, speculating about reasons and sharing a bathroom anecdote about a coworker, Gary.  Technical issues with their app were also mentioned.  They debated the ethics of politicians changing stances after leaving a race (using John Huntsman as an example) and made a ridiculous $250,000 bet (for charity) that Chris Jenner could prove Rob Kardashian’s paternity of Khloe’s child via DNA.  They noted the lack of immediate social media response to the bet, criticized Elton John and Bernie Taupin, and briefly discussed a fight at a Chuck E. Cheese.


The Elton John and Bernie Taupin discussion continued, speculating on a past relationship, followed by discussion of a Bernie Taupin radio show.  The hosts’ outrage over the promotional poster continued, focusing on the inclusion of less prominent personalities (Eminem and "Book Radio Lady" Pia Lindstrom) over themselves, using highly vulgar language and contemplating leaving the company in October.  Sam investigated "Book Radio Lady," which further fueled their anger.  They discussed an upcoming Rolling Stone interview and their reluctance to participate, touching on Opie's bowel issues, the Jenner/Kardashian bet, and a sexually suggestive Jeopardy recap.  Their frustration with the company and "Book Radio Lady" dominated the segment.

The final segment centered on a dispute over publicity photos for the Rolling Stone interview, specifically a cropped image making it appear Opie had his hand suggestively on Anthony's stomach.  They repeatedly demanded to see photo proofs from a publicist ("Mr. Trucker guy"), detailing the original and retouched versions with much frustration and profanity.  Extensive promotion of Jim Norton's comedy shows followed, with Sam Roberts joining the broadcast and listener calls.  The show concluded with continued promotion of Jim Norton's tour, Steven Singer Jewelers (with comments about attractive female employees), a book giveaway, and a final plug for their Facebook page.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  But enough of this palaver! Let's get the show on the road!  Ah, morning.  It's morning time for Tuesday, right? January 17th, 2012.  Yeah, trying to get back into the schedule, as they call it. The schedule.  Now it just takes one day off and it messes us all up?  Well, it was the whole weekend.  Yeah, it was an action-packed weekend at the Borgata.  We have to blame Jim Norton. 
[00:00:30]  I know. Jimmy Norton.  And his friends.  And gang.  And his friends.  And his gang of hooligans.  It was a motley crew.  It really was.  We went down there for antisocial. It was a huge success.  Oh my God.  Jim Norton, David Tell, Doug Stanhope, Artie Lang, and a little Jim Florentine doing a little time before the whole show started.  Which means he was part of the show.  That means he's part of your show.  So, he was for this weekend. I don't know if he will be for other ones. 
[00:01:00]  He did very well, too.  He did great.  Yeah, let me tell you.  Yeah, what's the problem?  His fucking voice is great, man.  He's really good on stage.  He was funny as fuck, man.  Everybody was really goddamn good.  Saturday show was better.  Oh, Saturday was better?  Friday was good, but Saturday, all the comics felt better.  Both shows were great, Jimmy.  Thank you.  You felt good about it?  Yeah.  Good.  Good.  Very good about it.  So, that means maybe more shows in the near future. 
[00:01:30]  Oh, we'll definitely do more.  Very good.  Everybody wants to.  I know Artie wants to.  I want to.  Dave wants to.  And Doug.  I could have just said everyone.  Everyone.  The whole four of us.  It really is.  You've got a great combination of comics that are.  Everyone is different.  Different styles and everything.  And all fucking hilarious.  All miserable pieces of shit.  Oh, my God.  Yeah.  When Ann said they're all different, I'm like, I don't know about that.  No, they have like.  They're all in the same genre.  No, they're all miserable, but there's such difference of like. 
[00:02:00]  How they go about their comedy.  Doug Stanhope and Dave Attell.  You know, both of them just miserable, nasty people.  Well, but their acts are so much different the way they present it.  Yeah.  Okay.  That's fair enough.  Like, you know, Dave is great.  He gets out there and it's very like, boom, boom.  He just hits you with hilariously awful shit.  And Doug is a little more long form and kind of flawed.  You don't know where he's going, but it always ends up in the fucking toilet. 
[00:02:30]  You realize Stanhope does.  He's well read.  Yeah.  Yeah.  That guy's a smart guy.  He's a smart guy.  Doug is just, he's, he's fucking really good.  Yeah.  And then just dark, but well read Jimmy, just hilarious, man.  When you were ragging on that, uh, that woman up front, like you want to fuck.  Was that the older woman?  Oh, yes.  I was fucking roaring.  Was that Friday?  I don't remember.  Friday.  Friday show.  Yeah.  Uh, Saturday.  Was it Saturday?  Sunday.  Wait a minute. 
[00:03:00]  Oh.  So it's Saturday show.  I mean Sunday show.  Oh, Saturday.  Cause Friday I was what?  But we, but we all understood what you meant.  Yeah.  Sunday show was better.  Cause you did Saturday and Sunday.  Oh, Sunday was better.  Gotcha.  Yeah.  That was it.  Okay.  Now it makes sense because of the MLK.  Yes.  See, we had the MLK and it screwed everybody up.  That was yesterday.  The MLK.  Yes, it was.  Was everything closed or no?  Day.  I don't know.  No.  Like the, the, the, the federal stuff was closed.  That's it.  Yeah.  Some states don't really recognize it still. 
[00:03:30]  Yeah.  You got to take a little drive.  You're usually a little further down South.  A bunch of people have worked yesterday.  Yeah.  But, uh, wow.  Bergada.  Damn.  They, they, uh, treat us nice down there.  Oh my God.  Very, very, very nice.  Like a king.  Well, you get treated differently, sir.  I had my fucking, my, my battalion of butlers.  And, uh, I wanted to see your room.  I didn't see your room. 
[00:04:00]  Oh.  I want to see what his suite looks like.  I'm sure it's luxurious.  To make it perfectly clear, me and Jimmy don't get a whole bunch of butlers.  I get no butlers.  Oh, you got to have the butlers.  Cause our action's a little different when we go down there.  And I go, I want to have steak dinner right now.  And they go, all right, go down to the restaurant.  No reservations for me.  Oh, that's good.  Yeah, I know.  Cause I get hungry.  But then I couldn't, I was so tired Saturday that, uh, when everybody, because I, I had, 
[00:04:30]  I had gambled and, and stayed up and saw your show and everything from Friday, uh, when  I got there, which was, you know, late afternoon, whatever it was.  And until Saturday at noon, that's when, uh, Kenny finally escorted me back to my  room and, um, said you've had enough and dropped me off.  Uh, but I was up, I was playing blackjack and then, uh, I wasn't doing very well.  So I went to poker, took a little poker break for a while.  Can you explain to people how you play blackjack? 
[00:05:00]  Hence why you get a whole bunch of butlers.  You're, you're, you're, you're leaving out chunks.  Oh, not everyone knows that you're a big, a big fat whale down there.  Gambler in the house.  Yeah.  I like, uh, I like the action, the action.  I like a few, playing a few spots sometimes, not all the time, but, and then I like betting,  uh, you know, sometimes hitting that table max in the high roller room every so often.  What's table max?  Uh, six G's.  Six G's a hand?  Six G's a hand.  My gambling is more tee hee. 
[00:05:30]  Tee hee.  A little three card and a little let it ride, but it's tee hee action.  Like, here's $15.  I hope I win.  Tee hee.  Well, everybody was, uh.  Gambler's a little different between me and you, and I don't think Jimmy gambles at all.  I dropped 20.  Oh, no.  I dropped $20.  On video poker, right?  Yes, video poker, $20.  Jimmy gambles video poker.  I played two hands.  I played maximum always, $2.  So it was $10 a hand, technically.  Lose, lose! 
[00:06:00]  End of gambling for me.  Oh, boy.  Lose, lose.  Lose, lose.  Uh, no, I was, I was playing blackjack earlier, and, and, on Friday.  Um, and then, because everybody's hanging out, you know, and I said it's going to be the  new Anthony.  Not the yelling, screaming Anthony.  All right, all right.  How long did that last?  It lasted.  Even the, one of the dealers was like, I can't believe, uh, I remember last time, uh, you're  a lot, uh, louder than this.  I'm like, ah, it's the new me. 
[00:06:30]  The dealers actually remember you?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  They, they remember some of my.  Those, those robotic assholes remembered you?  Well, the American ones.  You know, some of the, um, more Asian dealers, uh, they don't communicate as well at the  table.  I don't like that for some reason.  We had a Hindu dealer for a while.  Hindu.  And she had explained to us that, uh, she doesn't eat meat.  And then went over her whole diet, and people were screaming at the table, deal the cards!  Deal the fucking cards!  I don't care that you're a Hindu.  You're doing.  But at one point she said, uh, that she owns two cows and a bull. 
[00:07:00]  And she lives close to Atlantic City.  Where are you allowed to have two cows and a bull?  I don't know.  Yeah, where, where can you?  Anthony gives away $6,000 a hand and makes fun of people who want to make more than $7  an hour.  Hey, dickbag.  Shut up.  I earned the right to play with my money the way I want to fucking play with it.  Why?  You think I should give it to you?  In taxes, you fucking cocksucker?  Blow me.  I've had enough fucking nights at the casino where I didn't win. 
[00:07:30]  And, uh, well, this weekend I walked away a winner.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Whatever.  But I did.  It was great.  It was, uh, it was fun.  First, uh, first chunk of the night, not very good.  Right.  Played poker, took a break.  Right.  And then, um, the Saturday morning into Saturday afternoon, did very well.  And then, um, Saturday night we went to dinner, went to go get some steaks and I was sitting 
[00:08:00]  at the table pretty much falling asleep.  I said, I got to go back to the room and go to sleep.  I go, could you please just bring, bring my dinner upstairs and I'll eat it at some point.  I wound up eating it at 6.30 a.m.  On Sunday, as I watched TV in my room, eating a filet mignon like a donut in bed.  I was holding it, just eating it like a jelly donut.  And the reason you say that, because now the fat on the top of it is like the glaze of the  donut, right?  It was wonderful.  It was, it was very cold.  I would imagine. 
[00:08:30]  Oh, well it was, no, I, I, I kind of heated it a little bit, but I was just kind of laying  there, just eating it in bed and wiping my fingers on the sheets here or at the Borgata.  At the Borgata.  Yeah, that was good.  And then, uh, we wound up leaving Sunday, Sunday afternoon.  Cause I kind of, I like that one day buffer of just being home and set, settling in.  Very good.  That guy's giving me shit because I fucking gamble.  Leave me alone.  I, I've lost and I've won. 
[00:09:00]  I've lived and I've loved and I've lost.  Thank you.  I have to have one tissue in each pocket.  Oh boy.  What's going on with you?  I'm a little stuffy.  Is that a new OCD?  I've always had this.  One in each pocket.  One in each pocket.  Why do you do that?  For nose blowing purposes.  Well, why does there have to be one in each pocket?  Beats me.  And why the jean pockets?  Why not the hoodie?  The hoodie's easy to get at.  The hoodie pockets.  No, I know, but then they stick out.  Aw.  And that could be a problem.  It just looks creepy. 
[00:09:30]  Aw.  Yeah.  It just looks dirty.  That's terrible.  Yeah.  We were having a lot of fucking blackjacks on the dealer's side.  Really?  And a lot of 21s.  More 21s than blackjacks.  But the 21s on the dealer's side.  Man, when you are sitting on a 20 and other people at the table have 21s and they've worked  fucking six cards to get it and you sit back and the dealer's showing a four or a five  or a six and you're like, ah.  I'm in the money.  Nice.  All right.  You know what?  Next hand.  I'm in the money.  I'm going to take these winnings and then next hand I'm going to, what? 
[00:10:00]  21.  Just bam.  Eh.  Okay.  Eh.  Insurance.  Insurance.  Nothing.  Nothing.  Oh, good.  Okay.  Ace.  Another ace.  That's two.  Twelve.  Fifteen.  Sixteen.  Twenty-one.  What?  What?  Drives you guys nuts.  Oh.  My.  God.  I got raped like that once.  Just once, though. 
[00:10:30]  But it was a.  I had six grand up and I had doubled down.  Damn.  It was a $12,000 hand.  Wow.  I had pulled a fucking, um, I had an 11 to start with.  I pulled a nine.  So I pulled a 20.  I'm sitting on a 20.  The dealer is showing a four.  That fucking face comes up and I'm like, nice.  Fourteen.  Busted.  Seven.  Wow.  How angry were you when that seven popped up? 
[00:11:00]  I fucking.  $12,000.  My head spun around.  I'm looking at everyone else at the table who then quickly looks down as to not make eye  contact with me.  They don't want to make eye contact.  But instead of yelling, I just went, what?  What?  What?  No.  No, you didn't.  What did you do?  What did you do?  I yell at the dealer like a dog that just shit on the rug.  What did you do?  No, no, no.  Yeah.  Yeah.  That was a, uh.  That one hurt. 
[00:11:30]  That one stung.  That hurt a little.  I must admit, that one had a tinge of a sting to it.  Dust Proud fucking with you.  Seven, please.  Yes.  Well, I did have the new thing because I, seven, please is getting hacked.  And especially with a lot of the, the listeners that were there watching Jimmy's show and  everything, uh, they come around and watch me play and, and they want to hear things.  And if I just do that, it's like old hat already.  So the new thing was when a seven comes out first round of cards, I get a seven. 
[00:12:00]  I don't want a 17.  I don't want something shitty like that.  What I want is a total of 11.  So I need four.  So when I get a seven, I go Seinfeld four, Seinfeld four.  Seinfeld four.  And then if it misses, I go Cartwright, Cartwright.  Travis is laughing historically.  There's your Seinfeld pal.  Mr. Cohen, nice man.  He live on Park Avenue.  Yeah.  You just quote, just quote Seinfeld life. 
[00:12:30]  Seinfeld four.  And then hope for a four to come up.  It didn't come up though.  Cartwright.  Just seems exhausting.  All these things that you have to yell and these superstition.  This is all gamblers have them.  This is so exhausting, Jimmy.  It seems exhausting.  Oh, look.  There's a three and an eight.  This reference.  That one.  That tick.  Oh, no.  There's a nine showing.  Right hand waving.  Right hand waving.  These gamblers are so superstitious, man. 
[00:13:00]  You know what's more exhausting?  Looking at you put a tissue in each pocket.  But that seems exhausting to me.  Boogies, please.  Bet you 20 bucks it's in the right pocket.  I wish I had gambling stories.  I tee hee gamble though.  Tee hee.  Cartwright.  I have no desire to put a lot of action on the table.  I'm Cartwright.  I just, you know, my brother was down there with a few of his buddies and we just were fooling  around a little bit.  Yeah.  I just fool around a little bit.  I hope you're gambling on a cruise right outside of off the shore of Italy. 
[00:13:30]  I just stayed at that table until I was at 90 degrees.  All your chips on the fucking.  What's that?  You would have stayed right there, right?  What the hell's going on with that cruise ship?  Well, it seems the captain's in court today.  Wow.  They don't fuck around over there, huh?  No.  They're really just fucking.  That's how you get things done.  Hey, you are getting into court.  Hey, my mommy.  You fuck up on a Saturday.  You're in court by Tuesday.  You're in court.  Yeah.  Wow.  What they're saying, initial reports, this captain was perhaps showing off a little bit. 
[00:14:00]  And other ships, and this ship in particular had done this before off the coast of this  island.  They get really close.  Because the people on the ship and the people on the island gather on the shore.  They love it.  And boom, boom.  They toot the little horn.  And they sail on their way.  They try to scrape that rock a little bit.  Well, the rock really looks like this clone.  The rock says.  The rock says, you ain't sailing by me.  I can't believe the rock caused this. 
[00:14:30]  The rock.  He has to be involved in everything, huh?  I know.  It cruised by this.  And it looked like, from what they showed, this giant fucking rock was just ripped the  hull of the ship open.  Is the rock underwater?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Can you see the rock, though?  Parts of the rock?  I think certain tides you can, maybe.  Yeah.  I'm looking at the thing in the paper.  Yeah.  And it looks like it was the bottom left hand.  Yeah.  It was underneath the water line, obviously.  And then it kind of, as it was filling up with water, it kind of rolled a little one side, 
[00:15:00]  rolled a little to the other side, and then, whoa, rolled back, bam, right on its side.  How long did it take to do that?  It took a while, though, right?  Yeah, a few hours.  And the water by the island, of course, it's shallow.  And this ship is giant.  So it's just kind of laying there on its side on the rocks and the bottom of the ocean off  of the island.  They're 10 feet.  Look at, by the way, look at the fucking, the CNN, the CNN words are in front of the  entire, they're 10, you can literally throw your cell phone to shore and have somebody 
[00:15:30]  charge it.  I'm going to be on the ship.  Could you throw my phone back?  Yeah.  Yeah, it really is.  People that were saying it was like the Titanic should really calm down.  They're up to thousands into the icy Atlantic.  Well, they're up to 28, 29 missing now.  Initial report, six missing.  Now they've upped that number a bit.  If you're missing from a ship, you're dead.  But that's not bad.  That's what I think.  That's not bad considering.  Right.  Considering there's, you know, 4,000 plus people on this thing.  Got to ruin vacation, that is. 
[00:16:00]  You think?  Oh, boy.  The people that saved their entire lives for their Mediterranean cruise.  Yeah.  You think they're a little bummed out today?  What do you do about your passport and jewelry and fucking gambling winnings on the ship?  Should I get back to your room?  It's going to be an insurance nightmare, right?  Yeah.  Well, the Italian crew.  Hey, yeah.  Hey, yeah.  They took the lifeboats.  You know, that really doesn't help the Italian military reputation because the crew was off first.  Yeah.  The captain, apparently, what they're saying, he says different. 
[00:16:30]  But they're saying that the captain left the ship before everybody was even really starting to get off.  Why would you be standing in the hall like a dummy with a life preserver on?  Wouldn't you just say, fuck these people, I'm getting off this ship?  No instructions for these people.  I got my own instructions.  Oh, yeah, I know.  Get me and my family off the sinking ship.  I'm not waiting for anybody.  It's called having, you know, a survival instinct.  If you just sit there and wait for your room to go underwater while you're laying in bed, you don't have that. 
[00:17:00]  Well, we're looking at a picture.  We were looking at a picture.  The whole hallway was packed with people with life preservers on waiting for instructions.  Fuck that.  I wouldn't be one of those guys.  When you get on a cruise ship here and in Miami and stuff, when you take like Royal Caribbean and Carnival and those things, Norwegian, they have a muster call.  Not mustard.  It's a muster call.  And it's right when you get on the ship and you've got to put your life jacket on and go to your station.  I've been through one of these.  But no one takes it seriously. 
[00:17:30]  Well, you know what?  They take it fucking seriously because you've got to go.  Right.  They check you off of the list.  They make sure you're not in your room.  And they make sure you're absolutely where you're supposed to be by your lifeboat stations and things like that.  And then you go about your business partying and getting drunk and throwing your fucking wife off the boat so they can't ever find her again with the rock coat.  Pat from Wynaki, it's the Tilt Tannic.  The Tilt Tannic.  The Tilt Tannic, they're calling this one.  That's not too bad.  They could have used you for ballast.  Get Pat on the other side. 
[00:18:00]  Yeah.  So these people didn't really even know what to do.  So I guess they're listening to just individual crew members who don't know what to tell them.  Sorry.  Saying, ah, we'll go on this boat.  Sorry, that's stupid.  What do you mean you don't know what to do?  You know there's a major problem.  Everyone has a life preserver on.  That can't be good.  And it's starting to tilt to the left.  Yeah.  You get the fuck off.  You also know you're 10 feet from the shore, though.  Yeah.  When you look out the window and you still see your car parked.  What a real Titanic situation.  Well, we didn't get up there for the muster party. 
[00:18:30]  The muster.  There was no time for it.  They probably hadn't done the muster.  Wait.  Yeah, they do it the second day, which is weird.  This didn't just take off, right?  It was only a day into its...  Oh, I thought it was just leaving the ship.  No, no, no.  No, no.  It was like a day into its little voyage.  And I think the muster call is the second day on this ship.  And somebody actually said, I was listening to some Connecticut chick.  What if something happens on the first day?  And that's what she said.  She goes to her mother.  She goes, what if something goes wrong on the first day?  And, of course, they probably said, like, oh, stop it.  They say this ship's unsinkable. 
[00:19:00]  And then, you know, Rose gets naked, and some guy paints her.  Stupid movie about a one-night stand.  Enough already.  And then how many people have had one-night stands?  They didn't have a whole movie made about it.  And then Jack's holding onto a door, and she's floating on the door.  And then Jack slips away, and the water is up to his belt as he walks onto the island.  You know what?  Because it really isn't that deep.  Well, going back to the Titanic, though, if I'm Jack, I'm pushing her off the door because I don't know her.  Yeah, you don't know her.  I had a one-night stand with you. 
[00:19:30]  One-night stand.  It's every man for themselves.  Yeah.  I'm going to be on top of that door, not you.  Exactly.  Not you.  Pretty near, pretty near the island.  Not even far.  Give them a kayak so they can use it as a bridge to walk from the boat to the island. 
[00:20:00]  Let me tell you something.  As a man, you have a responsibility.  You get to a point in your life where you know you have to sacrifice your own life for your wife.  Yeah.  And in my case, now my son.  I know now that if, God forbid, my son's on the tracks, let's say, and a train's coming, I'm going to have to fucking take my own life to save his.  So you're women and children first on a boat?  Huh?  No.  Oh.  Fuck no.  Your wife and kid first.  Oh, yeah.  Make sure they're taken care of. 
[00:20:30]  But what I'm saying, back to the Titanic scenario, one night stand, maybe, you know, two days.  Fuck that.  I'm not taking my life for yours.  That's why that movie's stupid.  No one would do that.  Well, it was true love.  How is it true love?  It was two days, three days maybe.  Oh, you're so cynical.  Oh, really?  You wouldn't take your life for anyone.  Fuck that.  Get off the door.  I don't think there's one person you know where you would take your life over theirs. 
[00:21:00]  I know.  Yeah, you know.  I'm just saying the Titanic scenario is dumb.  Yeah.  They should have made it where they kind of knew each other before the boat ride.  Well, they were from such different classes that that would have ruined the whole story of how she's this rich socialite and he's a piece of shit.  Three days.  Would you take your own life over a girl that you've known for three days?  Really?  Really?  Goddamn, better be some girl motherfucking pussy.  That must be some girl fucking pussy. 
[00:21:30]  That has to be amazing pussy.  Times ten.  I don't know.  When you're in that situation, what do you do, though?  You're going to say, look, I've got to throw you into the icy North Atlantic.  You'd bite her fucking nose until she lets go.  You rich whore.  You left your fiancé and fucked me in a car on a boat.  I would bite her nose off until she fell into the ocean.  Fat cunt.  And then, because you are a man in the end, you make believe you didn't fight for your life with a broad.  Yeah, yeah.  And you sit all nice on the top of that door and wait to be rescued. 
[00:22:00]  And wait.  And go, I don't know what happened.  I just ended up here.  Well, Billy Zane wasn't quite the hero in that movie.  Right.  And he wound up looking like a dick bag.  The goat.  Yeah.  But you know what?  Yeah.  He's alive.  Well, true.  But he killed himself in the crash of 29.  Oh, is that what happened?  Anyone else notice that John Elway looks like just a pile of rocks?  Elway is...  What is going on with this guy?  Yeah.  He's a great steakhouse in Denver. 
[00:22:30]  I know he's an older gentleman, but he just looks like you piled a bunch of rocks together.  Don't laugh at me or anything, football people.  What does he have to do with the Broncos now?  Not the old days.  I know what happens when you're a sinner.  Yeah, you kind of give him a job.  Yeah, so they gave him a job.  Because he's the guy that's representing, talking about fucking Tebow.  He's a legendary Bronco, and he won the Super Bowl late in his career.  So you give him a job.  That's how I look at it.  I don't really know what he does.  Yeah.  I don't know.  But he's now saying that Tebow's going to be their starting quarterback next year. 
[00:23:00]  He's their executive vice president of football operations.  Meaning they just gave him a job.  Now, why didn't Tebow win?  What happened?  We all knew.  What happened?  I did hedge my bet the last radio show we did before the little break.  I said, I'm going for Denver and Tebow, but there's not a chance that they're going to win in New England.  I did say that.  Where was Jesus?  Where was Jesus?  I think he had to deal with the fucking Tiltanic.  Oh, you think people were praying that they don't drown? 
[00:23:30]  Yeah.  And Jesus was like, Tebow.  See?  I got a, I got a, you're one set of footprints here, pal, and I ain't carrying them.  No, he was helping the captain get off the boat.  The captain was praying, help me get off.  And I looked down and said, Jesus, why is there only one set of splashes on the way to the island?  I'm carrying you, Cappy.  Can we get back to the dummies in the hallway with their life preservers?  Yeah.  So you're, you've been on a bunch of cruise ships.  Oh, yes.  I've been on one. 
[00:24:00]  You're wonderful.  And I did enjoy myself, certainly.  I'm going in February with Mr. Cartwright and Mr. Cohen.  He nice man.  He live on Park Avenue.  But these guys are in the hallway with their life preservers on waiting for instructions.  Yeah.  But the people that are giving instructions are human beings also.  Right.  And you think they're going to be like, well, man, I might get fired if I don't do my job properly under these circumstances.  Or are you the guy, or are you the guy that's working for the cruise ship going, fuck that, I got to get the hell off this sinking ship. 
[00:24:30]  It's their duty, like the captain.  You know, the captain doesn't think at any moment something's going to happen and he's going to be like, I'm in jail.  I was just the captain of a ship, motherfucker.  No one likes their job enough to risk their own lives thinking, well, I know that my life's in peril here, but I certainly have a job to do before I save my own life.  No, in these situations, you've got to realize all authority is thinking the exact same shit you are, and it's every man for themselves.  Every wop for himself. 
[00:25:00]  Yeah.  Well, yeah.  Wow.  Yeah.  Yeah, they're all looking intently at somebody talking like, please, tell us what to do.  How about not being crowded in a hallway?  How about that guy doesn't even work for the fucking ship?  They're all looking at him like, well, could you lead us maybe?  I would so do that.  I'd be, not worrying people, nothing to worry about.  Go back to your rooms.  Right.  Take off your life jackets and meet me on the Lido deck for the chocolate buffet at midnight. 
[00:25:30]  Bam, bam, bam, bam, bam, bam, bam, bam, bam, bam.  And then people would go back and die.  I would walk in that situation.  Obviously, the hallway here we're looking at is completely crowded.  Yeah.  I would make believe I'm the guy and go, look, yeah, you've got to get back to your rooms.  Attention, everybody.  Right.  Eyes on me.  And now the hallway's clear and I'm running me, my family, and our bags off the ship.  Jumping into a lifeboat.  Running down that empty hallway.  Long three-yard voyage to the island.  I am not.  That fucking island. 
[00:26:00]  I am not sticking.  I'm not staying behind for women and children.  I don't know.  Period.  And that's how people think.  That's human nature.  Get off there and Benjamin Linus meets you.  It's all like a gag.  Yeah.  It's like one of the ship's little games that they play.  Like, oh, it's a lost cruise.  You didn't know.  Yeah.  Grandma's dead in a room.  How many are dead officially?  How many?  What's the official count?  Because it keeps going up.  Six right now. 
[00:26:30]  Six?  And almost 30 missing.  And there's, like, a couple of elderly Americans are amongst the doom.  How humiliating to die 10 feet from the shore.  On a ship that's half sunk.  It hit a rock.  It just kind of tipped over.  What are you doing?  Half sunk boat.  What were you doing?  Just sitting out the window that time that it happened?  Or were you under the boat?  Like, between the boat and the rock?  How do you die there?  I know.  It really doesn't make sense.  Well, the water rushed into the poor people's rooms.  Because if you have money, you're up higher, right, Ant? 
[00:27:00]  Is that how that works?  Yes, that's true.  So you stayed in the air longer.  I would have just stood there, right?  In my suite, as I get.  I would have stood there.  And as the boat tipped over, I'd have just slowly stepped off my balcony onto the island.  Right.  Wave.  Thank you.  Right.  And then asked the butler to bring me some brajute and cantaloupe.  Can I deal with Chris Allen from Cliffside Park?  He goes, fake story for the movie, dude. 
[00:27:30]  Well, when I'm watching a movie and there's a storyline, I like it to be believable.  Oh, my God.  And it's not believable that these two dopes fell in love after three days and the guy is now going to say, well, you know what?  Enjoy your life because I'm sacrificing mine for yours.  Get the fuck out of here.  I want my stories to be sort of believable.  So go fuck yourself, Chris Allen.  Thank you.  He was cold.  He really was.  Thirty-nine Britons on board reported safe and well. 
[00:28:00]  Oh, that's the British paper.  That's all they care about.  I love how countries really care a lot more about the people that are from their country.  That's why they're like, and five Americans aboard were trying to get reports on one and one from our area.  And it's like it's even better if they're from your local news area.  Yes.  It's like, oh, yeah.  And a Connecticut couple was on the ship.  Go figure that one out.  We don't care about the, you know, Italians that drown or anything like that. 
[00:28:30]  Fuck them running.  It is weird.  And the Britons are like, hey, 36 Britons on board.  Don't worry, people.  They're all okay.  If I don't know them, I don't care where the fuck they're from.  I just don't care.  Right.  Right?  Yeah.  I don't care.  I don't know any of these people.  It sucks.  It's a tragedy.  But what are you going to do?  Oh, how do you think they're trying to find them?  I know that they're blowing some holes in the boat there so the divers can get into these areas that they can't get to around because, you know, half the boat's underwater. 
[00:29:00]  You think they might still be alive in there?  No.  They're saying they were hoping for air pockets and stuff.  But what are you going to do?  The water's cold, though, right?  It's like 50 degrees.  Yeah, the water is cold, but that'll get you.  If they're in an area that is blocked by water, but then there's an air pocket, perhaps they could stay in there.  I don't know.  It just seems like dumb people are the ones that were left.  I apologize to anybody from the U.S. that is listening that was on the boat.  I don't know.  They were probably really close to where that hole struck, right? 
[00:29:30]  I don't know.  Maybe they just...  Is that boat going to go all the way under, too?  Nah, that's...  There's a ledge.  There's a ledge.  It could fall off the ledge, and that's the problem.  Why would that be a problem?  Like Sam's action figures?  What's that?  Like Sam's little action figures?  It could fall off the ledge?  Yes, exactly.  It's on a shelf.  Which is more tragic.  Why would it be...  Who cares if that happens now?  Because they're still rescuing people.  Meaning that's what they're worried about during the rescue.  And they don't want tons and tons of fuel coming out of that boat. 
[00:30:00]  Oh, that thing is fucked up.  That captain's screwed up.  What's that?  Man.  That's a big gaping hole in the side of the boat.  Twisted metal.  Oh, my God.  What the fuck is the guy saying?  Jesus Christ.  What a fucking dummy that captain is.  And a piece of rock is from the seabed ripped a hole in the...  Oh, yeah.  That's the big hole.  And that's a big rock?  What is that?  I don't even know what that is.  Where did that rock come from? 
[00:30:30]  Millions and millions and millions of years ago, Opie.  When the world...  But it detached from the bigger rock?  I don't know.  It looks like a little pebble is stuck.  Or did someone throw the rock?  Did someone throw a rock at the boat?  Wow.  Well, you know, if that thing did slip up, I don't...  I can't see that thing going anywhere.  That thing's embedded now.  No, part of it, I think, is hanging over a shelf.  Yeah?  You think the band played on?  No.  And the band played on? 
[00:31:00]  They were done.  Yeah.  They fucking left.  I'm sure everybody did.  I'd have been off there so quick.  Titanic also, the band kept playing, right?  Yeah, they said,  Oh, fuck it, mate.  We're going under.  Just keep playing the music.  And they did.  On the deck.  The people in the lifeboat, some of the survivors said,  they heard the faint music as they watched the Titanic slip below the surly North Atlanta.  That didn't happen either.  No? 
[00:31:30]  I don't think it did either.  Nah.  I think they were just like, crying, killing each other.  Guys trying to float on a banjo in fucking 10 degree water.  Yeah, the band wasn't playing.  That was, yeah.  Heel prints on your stupid violin as people were trying to figure it out.  Yeah, they thought they had music.  It's just the mass of panicky people running over the guy's instruments.  Right, of course.  Beating people over the head with a fucking fiddle to get on a lifeboat.  A viola.  A viola.  You going to watch Titanic 3D, though?  That's coming out soon. 
[00:32:00]  Same movie, just in 3D?  Yep.  Yeah.  Why would I do that?  Because the water will be splashing right at you.  It'll be like you're on the boat with the icy water.  Jimmy, that sounds very scary.  The water will be splashing right at you.  You're going to go and sit there and you better bring your parker because the water's  going to be splashing towards you.  I don't like that.  It's very scary.  I got a suggestion for the IMAX theater.  Yeah.  Make it very cold in there.  Oh, so people can really, and then spray water on people.  And spray cold water. 
[00:32:30]  So you're just cold and wet and dying of hypothermia watching the movie.  And then really give them an experience.  Does he have to milk more money out of this franchise?  I know.  He's turning into a George Lucas.  We would all do that.  Make another one.  God, if I could turn this fucking radio show into 3D, I'd do it tomorrow for some cash.  It is 3D, though.  Look.  Three dopes.  Oh.  You know what?  The CGI doesn't even look as good as it did when it first came out. 
[00:33:00]  You were like, wow, that looks like the ship.  Oh, look at him.  Somebody else paid for a cruise and DiCaprio's rubbing his heart on on the beginning of the ship  and her asshole is an enchanting girl worth dying for.  Fucking idiot.  Yay.  No, Jimmy.  Uncle Paul, I mean.  It's just dumb.  Yeah, it doesn't look as good.  No, they didn't have that water thing quite down next to the ship.  I was watching clips of the textures.  I make fun, but that was a damn good movie, man.  It was a good movie.  I'll give it a good movie.  Damn good movie. 
[00:33:30]  I mean, the action sequences were pretty good.  Yeah, you know, the lovey-dovey shit.  If you're into that, it's good.  And if you're not, you just get the action.  Her tits were ample.  Her big fucking tits.  Those were ample boobies.  As he was painting her fucking tits.  Yeah.  But he painted her cunt, too, didn't he?  He probably did.  He painted her big cunt.  Big fat fucking tits and her big cunt.  Oh, and you know it was big and fucking bushy back then.  He was like Bob Ross painting a tree. 
[00:34:00]  Wow.  Now go into your black hair.  See, this is going to stink because...  Oh, she's on her period.  Now get this lizard and crimson.  We're going to go with a little lizard and crimson right about there on her labia.  And a little on the lake.  You would think that her bush would have soaked up some of the water coming in.  Oh, yeah.  A big cold bush soaking up that icy Atlantic.  But this wasn't made for 3D originally, so the shots are not... 
[00:34:30]  So they probably had to find place.  A little bit of water can splash in here!  But they're reading.  I don't care.  She's brushing her teeth from water can splash in.  They built an entire set in a tank.  In a big water tank.  And were able to turn on the water and flood the set.  So that the hallways would fill up the water and they're in there.  And then they were able to just drain it out and start again.  How amazing is that?  James Cameron usually goes all out.  When they did the movie.  Yeah.  Have you ever seen the making of the Titanic? 
[00:35:00]  I haven't.  It's amazing.  Oh, it's so romantic!  It's fucking amazing.  I was so dumb.  I still remember the first time I saw a Titanic poster.  Oh, yeah.  It was on 10th Avenue.  And I'm like, that movie is going to bomb.  It's the biggest selling movie of all time.  I so don't know what's going to be a hit.  I remember seeing on one of the bus boards a Sopranos ad.  Before the Sopranos came out.  And it said, if one family doesn't kill him, the other will.  That was like their slug line.  And it really downplayed how dramatic and serious and deadly the show was. 
[00:35:30]  I thought it was a wacky mob show where it's like, oh, the wife and kids are hassling the mob guy.  And the mob guys are like, look out for him.  And I remember looking at that going, that is going to fucking just speak cancel.  Enjoy your one season, nobody people.  And then I apparently was wrong.  Yeah.  YouTube should just ban accounts of people that dislike really cool videos. 
[00:36:00]  Yeah.  Like, if you're way in the minority, we're looking at making of the Titanic.  Yeah.  This video has like 780,000 views.  Oh, what happened to that microphone?  A shitload of likes, obviously.  And then 27 fucking dopes.  How do you dislike the making?  But then YouTube has to get involved and go, you know what?  You're just a fucking dopey hater that, you know, you just want to hate everything.  We have to ban you.  You know what?  Let me tell you something. 
[00:36:30]  Those fucking thumbs up and thumbs down are pretty close together.  Do you think that's possible that with all those, a few people hit the wrong fucking button?  Because why would you watch something called Making of the Titanic then?  Yeah.  You would assume, holy fuck, this is going to be cool as shit.  I thought it was going to be like when they built the fucking thing.  Right.  Real footage?  And the miniatures.  Where's real?  Oh, there's no real.  Oh.  Yes, real footage of underwater.  Oh, they got the real footage. 
[00:37:00]  I swear to God, for a half a second, I thought it was the sinking and I caught myself.  Oh, Jimmy.  Nobody remembered their iPhones is what happened.  Well, thank you, Kenny.  Yeah, is there any cool video coming about?  We're a hell out of a second.  Yeah, there's a fuckload of video from this one.  Yeah.  Yeah.  The Undertaker's here.  I've never seen that jacket.  Oh, my God.  What's wrong with you?  You look like a lawyer in England.  I'm playing The Undertaker music.  Let's know.  Kenny's got a long, what do they call that?  It's a trench coat.  Yeah, a trench coat, but it goes all the way down the floor. 
[00:37:30]  But it doesn't have a belt.  That's the executive.  It's got a belt.  Oh, it does.  What are you saying, constable?  I'm sorry.  I don't like wearing it.  Why not?  Because it's too long.  Can't you take it off at this point?  I will.  I just got back.  You're like a doorman.  Yes.  That's a doorman.  Where does he get his clothes?  Remember when Bugs Bunny went up to the doorman, he was dressed like that, and he grabbed  one of the buttons and turned it and opened the doorman's coat like a door and walked  into his coat and poked his face up next to it and talked to him? 
[00:38:00]  That's funny.  Hilarious.  Oh, Kenny.  I'm sorry to interrupt.  No, you're not interrupting.  Your name ought to be Buttons McGillicuddy.  I know.  Look at that.  Button, button, button, button, button, button, button, button.  There's a lot of buttons on there.  Holy shit.  Not one is unbuttoned.  There's a top button, button, and then there's a button, and a button, and a button, and a button,  and a button, and all buttons all the way down.  You don't like that coat, huh?  No, it's too long.  It's not...  You need a fedora with that, though.  You could be like Sam Spade.  Yeah.  Or a stocking cap. 
[00:38:30]  Yeah.  It's a giant fucking...  Yeah.  A giant thing you're sleeping.  You won't see it again.  No.  I won't see this anymore.  I don't like wearing it.  Why?  No.  But you paid good money for it, though.  I know, but...  Why is it buttoned up?  It's because I was outside, so...  Oh, let's see how it looks unbuttoned.  But what were you doing?  You got a paw there?  I was doing things.  That is so much material.  It really is.  Like, Kenny's clothes take so much material.  That would be a comforter on my bed. 
[00:39:00]  The old loom working overtime.  He shops at the Big and Lummox shop.  That's true.  The Big and Lummox.  Oh, man.  That is a big jacket.  It's a big jacket.  Yeah.  A big jacket.  I tried Kenny's suit jacket on once.  I'm like a three-year-old.  Oh, that would be hilarious.  That would be a big...  That would go down to the floor on you.  Yeah.  Yeah.  You don't like it?  It's too long?  Yeah, it's not good.  I would say I wouldn't like it because of the lack of accessibility. 
[00:39:30]  Yeah, but if you think or have an inkling that the shit might go down...  Yeah.  You pull some Matrix shit.  Yeah.  That's what you are.  You're moron fierce.  Right?  I tried.  You think the shit might go down.  Yeah.  And, like, if you wear these, like, trench coats in a crime scene...  Yeah, yeah.  ...and it's all, like, dragging and shit.  Oh, into the evidence.  Dragon.  Blood evidence.  Breathing fire or something? 
[00:40:00]  No.  Dragging.  Yeah.  Because you're always bending over, looking at shit.  Oh.  Kenny's the one.  And it's the IQ.  Yes.  Yeah.  All right, Kenny.  Yeah, those are big lapels.  All right.  All right.  Great job this weekend, everyone.  Thank you, Kenny.  And great job, Kenny.  What do you mean, everyone?  What was our jobs?  Well, I gambled and just hung out.  Yeah, but no, you...  What did I do?  I did nothing.  You walk around looking good. 
[00:40:30]  Oh.  Well, that was my job.  That's what you do.  Nice.  There you go.  Yeah.  Can he get paid well for that?  Yeah.  Anthony did well at the tables, and Jimmy did well on stage.  Well, Jimmy was the workhorse.  We were just there to support him.  We didn't do anything.  No, no, no.  I literally did nothing.  You guys are integral parts of the situation.  Integral.  What's that, a city?  Ah.  Oh, my God.  I don't like the double clap and the two-finger pistol point that Chip's doing now. 
[00:41:00]  Chip's on the money.  It's very...  Sure not going to...  Yeah, it's very leather Tuscadero.  Sure not going to miss Chip for the next three days.  What's that?  Yes, you will.  No, I'm not.  You will miss Chip terribly.  No, no, no, no, no.  Yeah.  All right.  Me and Jimmy had to make believe we weren't looking at each other bare-chested over the weekend.  Oh, no.  Yeah.  We were hanging out, and what do you call that thing?  Well, I was swimming.  A cog.  Yeah, yeah. 
[00:41:30]  Men's room.  I was swimming, and Oop came in.  And then I had to kind of cover up my boobies, and Jimmy covered up his, and we had a little conversation by the pool.  And then we went into that hot thing.  Yeah, hot tub.  A jacuzzi.  A jacuzzi isn't supposed to be that big.  We were sitting close.  Our leg hair was touching.  Yeah, but the jacuzzi was twice the size of this room.  Yeah, it was gigantic.  That water club pool at the Borgata, I swear I did laps.  I'm back to working out.  Oh.  I was fucking so sore from working out.  Like, I swam, and I'm not used to swimming.  My body was aching. 
[00:42:00]  Yeah.  Before the show Sunday night, I'm in the dressing room, and I can hardly walk.  I'm so tense and sore.  I'm like, I'm not going to be funny tonight.  I feel terrible.  So I actually stripped down into my underpants three minutes before I went on and just stretched  in the dressing room because I was so achy from swimming.  And as I'm putting my shoes on, I'm bent over my chair, and I look in the mirror, and I see  my fucking stomach fat hanging from the side, and I'm like, you obese piece of shit.  Is this what you're doing right before you entertain everyone? 
[00:42:30]  The fucking music is starting.  Florentine's about to walk on, and I'm looking at my stomach in the mirror.  I'm like, you pig fuck.  No more.  My God.  No carbs, nothing.  You should have committed Harry Caray in front of everybody.  Dude, it would have been a blessed relief to put a fucking giant sword through my stomach.  Jeez.  Jesus.  We should take a break, I guess.  Oh, we could eat.  Oh, we could leave one.  Ah.  Oh, God.  Gina Carano is going to be here in a few minutes.  Ooh.  She's a female, and she's got a really nice ass, because someone just tweeted me a fine 
[00:43:00]  picture of her ass.  I don't know much about her.  I know she's a mixed martial artist, and she's in that movie, which they're promoting very  heavily on UFC.  What movie?  That's what she's promoting.  Oh, we're supposed to know by now.  What movie?  Yeah, we should probably know.  Haywire.  It's called Haywire.  All right, cool.  Haywire.  So what?  She's a female MMA fighter?  Yeah.  Was she with Strikeforce?  Yes, she was.  Is she with the UFC yet? 
[00:43:30]  No, they don't do female fights.  They only do male fights.  Oh, oh, oh, oh.  But she left, she hasn't confirmed whether or not she's returning to MMA.  She beat, or she lost to Cyborg.  You know that?  Brazilian chick?  Yeah.  Is she Brazilian?  I think so.  I like female fighters, though.  Yeah?  That's the only, she's seven and one, though, I think.  Just Cyborg is the only one that beat her.  Oh, oh.  I wouldn't mind getting her, letting her hurt me a little bit.  Yeah.  Oh, well, you know, maybe she will.  No, she will.  Well, I don't, I'd be more nervous for the woman doing it, because it's like a female cop,  like they want to prove something. 
[00:44:00]  I'm a cop you idiot.  And they'll fuck you up good if you, you, uh, question them.  Yeah?  Yeah.  All right.  She was also an American Gladiator.  Was she?  Oh, yeah.  What was that?  American Gladiators?  Yeah, what was that?  It was a TV show.  Remember?  So, that's a long time ago.  Do you remember?  It was only like three or four years ago.  It was the relaunch.  Yeah, that's a long time ago.  That looks fake, by the way.  I'm looking at the new, the three, the, uh.  Yeah, the Titanic CGI. 
[00:44:30]  CGI is not what it was.  Do you think they worked on that at all?  Uh, you know what?  They had to if they were making it 3D.  Maybe they did.  Maybe they did.  But it does look kind of.  I don't know.  Well, you'd have to see it again.  That's just a YouTube video.  Someday they will be making movies.  Like, all you will need to do is voice capture somebody, and you'll be able to make an entire  movie with that person's.  I've clicked on UFC fights.  That's how dumb I am on fucking YouTube.  And it's actually.  Oh, right.  I'm like, I didn't know those two fight.  Chuck Liddell and Muhammad Ali. 
[00:45:00]  But I've opened them and then realized that it was a computer graphics fight.  But just from the, um, the, uh, the picture, you think it's a real fight.  You'd think it was the real people.  Yeah.  I could see how a colored girl could fall for that video.  A white girl.  I fucked up.  That's all right.  All right.  So she's coming in in a few minutes.  Also, uh, we got to talk about, uh, Jay-Z.  Oh, what's up with Jay-Z now?  I read that.  That annoyed me a lot.  It did.  Don't tell Anthony.  I want him to know about it live. 
[00:45:30]  Here, it's pretty dirty.  We also lost the, uh, world's, uh, fifth oldest tree.  How do they know it was the fifth oldest tree?  They asked him.  That's so dumb.  Why?  Why?  Like you said, how the fuck do they know?  How the fuck do you know?  Can't there just be a tree somewhere that they just haven't discovered yet?  Or a four.  Or does it have to be, like, sticking above the rest of them?  Yeah.  Maybe it's a shoe trail.  I hate that.  You don't have to double clap and then the double guns point? 
[00:46:00]  No, but I hate it and I'm not going to be able to stop doing it.  It's very addicting.  I see your luggage.  When the hell are you out of here?  My luggage, I leave at eight o'clock.  Eight o'clock?  I have an early flight today because the other one was not available.  Normally I had to take a one o'clock flight, but that flight now no longer exists.  So when that flight didn't exist, the other flight I was going to take, I couldn't take.  So I had to take the earlier one.  It's very rare that I'll take this one. 
[00:46:30]  Normally I'll stay the entire show when I'm leaving for Los Angeles.  And today I just couldn't do that.  So I had to take the earlier flight, which means leaving in the middle of the show, which is not what I wanted to do.  I really wanted to take the later flight, but it just wasn't possible.  And now more unnecessary cruelty.  Go fuck yourself.  With Jim Norton from the Opie and Anthony show.  All right, let me go to Jeff in Columbus.  Jeff. 
[00:47:00]  Hey, you boys.  Love the show.  Happy birthday, Jimmy.  Right, with the fucking, dude, how many times do we have to hear that for real?  Okay.  Go ahead.  What?  I was wondering if the guy had enough wits about him to hit the General E horn before he hit the concrete support shot.  This is why we hate the fucking callers, man.  It's like one fucking bad joke after another.  Hey, Bob Kelly, why don't you get some cancer and die?  Dude, it's me you're talking to.  And don't try to incorporate the fucking lingo of the show.  It's annoying.  Hey, did you wake up on the wrong side of the bed today? 
[00:47:30]  No, I didn't.  I'm just sick and tired of guys like you wrecking the fucking show.  We got a flow going.  Why'd you put me through?  I didn't put you through.  You fucking happy birthday.  We get it.  It's the same fucking joke time and time again.  Well, then.  Call up and make your fucking point.  Fucking asshole.  That it?  Hey, dude, you're the one that called up and fucking wrecked what was going on.  Anything else?  Cut your fucking losses, dude. 
[00:48:00]  Just fucking go.  Get killed.  Oh, that was ruthless.  I was hoping he would hang out for him.  Oh, was that ruthless?  Angry Jimmy.  That was certainly unnecessary, wasn't it?  Stay tuned for more Unnecessary Cruelty on the O.P. and Anthony Show.  Seriously, XM.  XM.  This is the O.P. and Anthony Show.  The O.P. and Anthony Show. 
[00:48:30]  Oh.  Bam, bam, bam.  Get in topical 
[00:49:00]  With the sex man  Good morning, lazy  Oh, didn't see that coming  Let's get lazy with these pickups  Uh-oh, what happened?  What's up, sexy?  Good morning  He doesn't answer the lazy, he answers the sexy  I see that  So what happened?  So, uh, today, Kid Rock turns 41 
[00:49:30]  Here's the thing  That's why I say lazy  Yeah, yeah, let me  I know exactly what Obie's gonna say  I want people to, like, go, why the fuck?  Like, everyone out there's going, oh, it has to be Kid Rock's birthday  Right, it has nothing to  It doesn't have to have something to do with music, necessarily  You always pick music  And then it has something to do with the band or something  Why don't you do something  Now, as we know today, Muhammad Ali is 70 years old, right?  Yep  So you could play something about the champ  Or, you know, some kind of song that would relate creatively to Muhammad Ali 
[00:50:00]  You know, the hippie hippie shake  For goodness sake  I got the hippie hippie shake  And then you'd be like, why are they playing this?  And you'd go, Muhammad Ali is 70  Right  I have a Muhammad Ali song I wrote  It was called Here Comes the Champ  Ah, see?  Or play like a butterfly song  Did you?  Yeah  Play a butterfly song  And then we'd go, why the butterfly song?  Yeah  And then you'd have to sort of relate that  Because he floats like a butterfly  Did the butterfly thing when he was flighting 
[00:50:30]  Fighting  Flighting  When he was flighting  Hey, are you flighting?  So you gotta trick us a little bit, E-Rock  Yeah, E-Rock  You're making it too easy  What do you think?  You agree?  I agree  All right  We were gonna talk about that stupid tree  So maybe you come back with some dumb tree song  And then we go, oh, it's a tree song  Tree  That's because we teased the tree story  Yeah  How was your weekend, E-Rock?  Busy  Very busy  What do you do on your day off? 
[00:51:00]  Packing  That's all I did the entire weekend  Yeah  I'm packing  Where are you going?  I'm moving  I'm moving  What?  Where?  On up to the east side  To a deluxe apartment in the sky  Hopefully to another state  Oh  Where are you moving to?  To a nicer area of New Jersey  Yeah  Are you upgrading?  Yeah  Oh  So  Oh, boy  I was at dinner last night  And E-Rock texted me again  Oh, boy  Oh, no  Does he still not have this down? 
[00:51:30]  No, he doesn't  Because there's a new thing that happens  Like he reads a motion into text messages  Oh, no  So he writes me  He goes, hey, you see what car companies are starting to advertise now?  No satellite mentions  And it's a picture  Which is very interesting  It really is  What's the picture of it?  It's an app screen  That you can get right in your car now, right?  Yeah, and it shows all the new features that the new cars have  But on your music selection 
[00:52:00]  It's now Pandora  And that iHeartRadio  That Clear Channel  Yeah  iHeartRadio is making a move  Let me tell you something right now  iHeartRadio is making a move  Is it?  Yes  I don't like that at all  I really don't care  So he shows that to me in a text message  And he says  You see what car companies are starting to advertise now  No satellite mentions  So there's a little competition thing happening  Sure  And i just write, uh-oh  Right?  Uh-oh  And he writes 
[00:52:30]  Well, at least you pretended  I thank you for that  Why were you mad?  Because if i  There was one text into our conversation  Oh, stop  There's a history of it  Where if i  If i say one thing  Oh, i'm a dick for acting this way  If i say  Oh, he doesn't give a shit  And i said  Okay, at least you  No, you didn't care  Now i'm getting shit on for that too  Wow  I wrote, uh-oh  So you're reading a lot into that  Is my point here  It's two lousy words with an exclamation point  Like, uh-oh  I looked at it  It's like, oh, here's another thing  Nobody cares about 
[00:53:00]  No, i wrote it like  Oh my god, this is not good  For our careers  Yeah, that's actually an answer you would give  No  Like, uh-oh  Are you  Are you  No, i'm serious  You're with me  Because Iraq is taking it  As like  Me and Iraq just have a weird history  Because then  I write, uh-oh  Because that was the start  Of like, wow, that's not good  I didn't know what else to write really  So i was like, uh-oh  And i was  I was in the middle of conversation  And dinner with people too, you know  So he writes  Well, at least you pretended  I thank you for that  So i just write back 
[00:53:30]  Dick  You are horrible at reading people  I meant  I meant it  Uh-oh  Yeah, because you can get  A lot of emotion off text  Yeah, well, don't assume so much  It's true  Yeah, you really assumed  A lot on an uh-oh  That was the first time  I saw that app  Mm-hmm  Where it says iHeartRadio  And that spot probably  Should be for satellite radio  Right  So i wrote, uh-oh  This is different  Than what i'm used to  And then he goes, sorry  I took it as  Who cares  Ha  And then I wrote 
[00:54:00]  Nope, that's interesting  Because Clear Channel  Clear Channel owns iHeartRadio, right?  Yes, they do  So they're making a move  Wow  It's a big move  They realize this satellite radio  Might be a problem  So they're trying to do their own thing  Yeah, but  And if you're in your car  And you can just, you know  Click on that iHeartRadio  Maybe you don't need the satellite as much  Hence the uh-oh  I honestly think  Clear Channel  Will just fuck it up  Who knows?  Somehow  And the satellite's not?  Well, that's true 
[00:54:30]  Yeah  Uh, Gina's here, I believe  Yeah  Where is she?  I don't know  Roland, is Gina here?  Thank you, Iraq, by the way  Yes, yes, yes  Iraq keeps me informed  On the latest happenings  And everything  Oh, hi  How are you?  Why are you fighting?  What's wrong with you?  Oh, take a seat  Have fun  Hi, Gina  No, we're good  Nah, we're  We're totally believing  What do you mean, oh, no?  You could beat the shit out of any one of us  At any moment  I'd rather get punched  No  Oh, help her with the headphones 
[00:55:00]  Oh  Yeah, that one spins around  There you go  And then  And then  No, actually  Do you have it on wrong?  See, see  It goes like this  Like, yeah, yeah, yeah  Hold on, you're panicking  Hold on  There you go  You're ready  Yes  All right, Gina  Uh, Carano's in studio  And, uh  Wow, you're beautiful  Yeah, yeah  I don't know why you're fighting  It's hoping  Hi, hi, Gina  You're beautiful  That's Jimmy  Nice smile, too  That's Roland  I like to smile 
[00:55:30]  Thanks, Roland  So, a fighter, huh?  Okay, so Jimmy, Roland  No, I just said I was Opie  He's Opie  Opie  He points at Opie  He points at Opie  He points at Jimmy  He points at Jimmy  He says Roland  I'm Anthony, though, so  Okay  That's easy  I tell you  That's Kenny  I'm Jim  Ope, Sam  That's Ant  And Roland  And he's outside  Right  That's actually Jimmy  Yeah, he's fucking with you now  Roland is not  I'm not actually giving the right name  No, he's Jimmy  Oh, you're Anthony  I'm not Jimmy  What?  This is not a good start  Roland was the creep that walked you up there 
[00:56:00]  Right  The one that nobody could understand  And you all politely nodded  That was Roland  The one who's like  Satellite  So, is this your first one of the day?  Yes  Yes  Yeah?  Are you uncomfortable?  Huh?  Are you uncomfortable?  I'm always uncomfortable  I'm just an awkward mess  Majority of the time  Are you?  I just get nervous for interviews  It never gets easier for me  What?  Is that when you started punching people in the face?  Yeah  Well, I was just never good at shit talks  So I've just always used my body as a way of communication  Would you just hit somebody if you got into an argument? 
[00:56:30]  No  No?  No  I don't mean now  I mean when you were growing up and stuff  Was it kind of like a  Ah, shut up, bam  No, it was usually more of like  They'd really have to taunt me or somebody I was with  So it was always usually like a defense type of thing  Oh, okay  No, I promise you  I'm not like a  No, no  I would think that was cool anyway  Because, you know  I kind of like that  They don't hit you in the face, do they?  They don't hit you in the face, do they?  In my sport?  Yeah  Yeah  Why would you let that happen?  I think that there's worse things in life  Yeah?  Than getting punched in the face 
[00:57:00]  You could have somebody constantly trying to screw you over  But just elbow to the face  At least this person, you know, they're coming  Down the hall  Yeah, I guess there is an honesty in that  Yeah  I want what you have  And I'm going to punch you in the face to get it  There's something to be said for you  I don't do that  So are you done fighting or no?  I don't know yet  It's kind of up in the air  What is the dilemma?  Do you want to see how the film does?  Or if you get offered more AccuWorks?  I'm sure it's a little easier to do  Yeah, well, I just  I know that fighting is not something that is really done good part-time 
[00:57:30]  So I've been doing it kind of part-time  But I also know that fighting is not something you can do for the rest of your life  So I'm trying to definitely, you know, get another career going here  I'm not going to lie  Good idea, yeah  But at the same time, it's my love  It's my, you know, first passion that I ever had  It's the thing that made me want to wake up and do something  So  Wish I could find that  Are you?  Just exhausted every day  I want to point out that you're shaking  Are you?  I am not 
[00:58:00]  Not right now  That hand's going  Okay, I'm a little bit  We're hilarious  We're cool  Don't worry about it  No, but it's funny what makes people nervous  We all have our things  And for her, it's interviews  For me, it's anything that a real man would do  Like doing your job is terrifying to me  Really?  Oh, yeah  It's like you guys have been in a couple fights  Not like, you know  Our faces do, right?  Yeah  No, I mean, you guys don't look like you'd really, like, back down  Your mouth's probably got you in a little bit of trouble in your life, right?  Yeah  Believe me, I would back down in a second 
[00:58:30]  I would talk my way out of it  Like, as soon as someone was going to punch me in the face  I'm like, what, do we want to go to jail?  And I would try to, like, lawyer my way out of it  I don't know  You look like you've had a couple  If you had a couple of drinks, you'd be, like, ready to go  Oh, boy  I'm in a bad position  I'm in a bad position  Because I don't have any midpoint defense or offense  I am either no fight or deadly physical force  Yeah  I can't, like, I can't fight off a mid-range threat  I have to either  He would run away or kill somebody 
[00:59:00]  That's pretty much it  Yeah, that's what he's saying  But not with his bare hands  No, not with his delicate card-holding hands  I lose my bare hands  No, no  Yeah  Terrible  And you over there?  You've been in a  Opie fights underwater  I've had a few  And I've seen him reach offstage  I'm retired  Over a line of probably four or five people in front of the stage  To punch someone in the face in the sixth row  It was amazing  It was fun  I might have a hot head  Yeah 
[00:59:30]  Not as much these days  Well, look, because this is kind of like a little bit of an extreme job  Well, I fought  I did fight a guy underwater once  It is to me  I was scuba diving  And I fought a Frenchman  Are you telling the truth right now?  Yeah  Yeah  I punched him in the face underwater  And then we kind of wrestled  It's really hard to punch underwater  Thank you  That's what makes the thing so stupid  It looks like Sea Hunt  Because even though I punched  It's in slow motion  I didn't do any damage  I looked like a fucking idiot  And then we rolled around a little bit  And then we were separated  And then we were jabbing each other  As the dive continued 
[01:00:00]  Well, what was wrong?  You didn't like his body language in the water?  He was a stupid Frenchman  That wasn't listening  He descended on top of Opie  Yeah, he wasn't listening to the instructions  That were given on the boat  Because he was a stupid Frenchman  Oh, my God  Are you French?  No  Oh, thank God  And then, yeah, he came down way too fast  Because he wasn't listening  And landed on my head  And that's scary  Because you got all the tubes and stuff  Tubes  That technical jargon  You blurt out about diving is amazing  So I was mad  So I punched the guy 
[01:00:30]  In slow motion  Like you had to point out  Yeah  You punch in fast motion  You sure do  We've seen that  Oh, hey  How come she doesn't have  I've watched some women fighting  And they do it in Strike Force  But now that that's been kind of gobbled up  It's like, is that going to go away?  No  I think that they're going to keep it  Actually, I'm really kind of stoked about  A fight between Misha Tate  And Ronda Rousey  Oh  See, I don't know  I know a lot of the UFC guys  But I don't know  Many of the women fighters 
[01:01:00]  I would say female fighters  How do you say that's respectful?  No  Punching bitches  Well, they're just getting their name out there  I think right now  Did you grab your coat?  Are you going to run away?  No  I'm like, is this over yet?  No  That's like every date I've ever had  They just sit there with their coat in their lap  I'm so ready to leave  I just need kind of like a pacifier  No, we're cool  Trust me, we're good  We're going to make you a big star  They're already a star  They're promoting this movie very heavily  Yeah, it's called Haywire  And it's in theaters Friday 
[01:01:30]  Yeah, we don't know the female division  Is that bad?  No  Because we love the sport  Me and Jimmy and Ant  Jimmy knows more than I  But I don't know the female division at all  Tune in, I think, Strikeforce on  It's either March 3rd or 4th  And there should be a really decent female fight between  I mean, Ronda Rousey's an ex-Judo Olympian  I mean, so she's  And she's got very, like, sassy  Kind of abrasive, like, style in her mouth  And it's kind of beautiful  I love that  Because I'm not like that at all  But it's nice to see somebody be able to, like, express themselves that way 
[01:02:00]  And then Misha Tate  She's just, like  She's worked really hard  I don't think she was naturally gifted with fighting  But she's worked so hard  And her last fight was against Marlis Conan  And everybody thought she was going to lose  But she won the belt  So I'm really actually very proud to come from my sport  And the women in it  What kind of a person are you in a relationship?  Like, because you're typically male-female  Next question  No, no, no, no, no  It's male-female dynamics, I understand  But what's it like to be  Do you only date fighters? 
[01:02:30]  Or do you just date regular civilians, too?  And what's it like to have that dynamic?  I've never been in a relationship with that dynamic  Where the woman could kick the shit out of you  Yeah, it's really kind of strange  Like, I've got guys constantly sizing me up  And I really kind of like the artistic, skinnier, same-size-as-me type of guy  So, I don't know  It ends up being very interesting  Because at least one time in each relationship I've had  You find us, like, wrestling on the bed  And, like, you know, you think that would be nice, hot, and sexy or whatever  But it's really not  Like, when, like, all of a sudden you look in their face 
[01:03:00]  And they're really trying  And they're starting to sweat  Oh, shit  It's like, this guy is trying  I know  I'm starting to feel slightly embarrassed, you know  Oh, man, that is bad  So, it gets really interesting  Oh, like, when you're wrestling around  And they're pretending it's playing  But they're really trying  And you're beating them  Yeah, it's kind of like on Dumb and Dumber  When, like, he, like, throws a snowball in her face  And then shoves it in  Yeah, that's really serious  Except for maybe opposite  Now, do you not like that in a guy?  Or are you okay with that if they embrace it?  Um, I just want a guy to be comfortable and confident 
[01:03:30]  And, uh, as long as he's funny  And isn't threatened by any type of career moves  Right  That would be nice  Yeah, yeah  He's got to be a badass fighter, I'm thinking  No, I don't date fighters, really  Even, like, how about, like, like, uh  I don't know, blue-collar guy  That just gets himself out of problems  Yeah, a construction worker  Who you just, like  That could fight  Yeah  Maybe not technically fight  But he could get himself out of some situations  Yeah  I find myself attracted to, uh, funny guys 
[01:04:00]  I would hate  Oh  I would hate to be dating her  And we're in a situation  And she has to get us out of it  No offense  Oh, man  I would love that  As a guy, that would  You would like that?  Oh, I'd live for her  I'd stand behind her and just talk shit  Really?  Oh, please  I love that  And I don't mean any disrespect  But as a male, I would have a tough time with that  Yeah  Well, good  Yeah  You think?  Is that bad?  No, I think that's great  Okay  And that's not  Or would you at least let me  I don't want my cowardice to be a turnoff  Would you at least let me have the first shot to try to get us out of it? 
[01:04:30]  And then you'll laugh and go, alright, step aside, let me take care of this  But it also sucks, because I think, I mean, getting in a fight in itself is nerve-wracking enough  Then to, I mean, when I think that guys are dating me, they actually feel more pressure  Yeah  I'm like, welcome to my world  Oh, they're kind of like, look what I can do  Or they're like, oh shit, I really gotta be good at this then  Yeah  See, I'm never afraid  Like, I don't fight  But if I get beat up, it's humiliating  But I'm always worried that my girlfriend is gonna get hurt  Like, that's what I'm worried about  Is that she's gonna get really hurt  Like, if I get beat up, it's just, it sucks and it hurts  But if you can't protect somebody 
[01:05:00]  Yeah  But knowing that you would be fine  I'm like, the worst that can happen is I get my ass kicked  At least I know you'll be okay  Oh, yeah  That's not as bad  Yeah, and I might even jump in on, you know, your behalf  I'll appreciate that  I'd be yelling in movie theaters  Shut up!  Shut your phone off!  And when they said what, I'd be like, yeah, she said it  Yeah, talk to her  Yeah, don't make me send her over  My thing is, I stay away from it until it's an absolute necessity  No, we hate as much  Yeah  Hey, what is Haywire about?  We should promote the movie a little bit 
[01:05:30]  Yeah, it's about Mallory Cain  She's a private contractor  She gets hired out to do some, you know, mission and kind of get screwed over  So you find her in, you know, a lot of fights with a lot of men  The double cross, I believe  Yeah  Yeah  And it was just a, I mean, my first film and, like, the most beautiful experience of my life  That's so cool, because it's, like, got a lot of good buzz and action  Michael Douglas is in it  Antonio Banderas  Ewan McGregor  Ewan! 
[01:06:00]  How do you say his name?  I don't know  How do you say Ewan?  Ewan, I said Ewan  I say Ewan  Ewan McGregor  The guy from Trainspotting  And Michael Douglas  And Banderas  Are you the lead in this?  Yeah  That is, like, star-studded  And you step in, it's your first movie  What do you do?  Do you, you know, do you freak out?  Now, I see you walking here and you're shaking  You must have been losing your mind  I think on live situations, my adrenaline just, like, pumps  But it's really nice, like, in filming this movie 
[01:06:30]  You get more than one take  Yeah, but just meeting those people  Those are some big stars  Yeah, and I definitely was shaking  I had a kissing scene with Michael Fassbender and Channing  And you can definitely, like, feel my heartbeat through my mouth  Oh, really?  Wow  Because it's, I've never done that before  How hot is that?  I'm so nervous  Damn it, we're all like, wow  Were you nervous?  Were you nervous?  Oh, yeah  Tell us more  No, wait, what?  Oh, sorry  I've never heard, you can feel my heart beating through my mouth  That's kind of hot  What a great singles ad  That's phenomenal 
[01:07:00]  She was  She got the different  She got a different reaction, I think  I was definitely nervous  More nervous for those than the fight days  So you're a good actress  Well, I don't know  Thank you  Have you got the lead in a movie?  I mean, that's a pretty big cast  They used a lot of UFC  Like, a lot of fighters and teams in movies now  Yeah  It's the hottest sport, I think  Well, I definitely  I didn't want to cheese it out  Like, I  And I feel bad  Because that's  The success of a movie  And the vision of the movie  All lies behind the director 
[01:07:30]  And I just got blessed  With having an amazing, amazing director  So it's like  You put some of these fighters  In certain movies  And of course  They're going to be cheesy  They've never done it before  And I'd never done it before  But it was good  Because I was surrounded  By such wonderful people  Do you hate when  Don't talk about Stone Cold  Steve Austin like that  Who else is going to  You know  But there's only one him  On the universe  Stone Cold's so bad  At acting  Is he a bad actor?  Yeah, he's pretty bad  How about you tell him that  Next time he's in here  No!  I'm going to  I never saw him act  The Rock is good  Like, The Rock puts out  Some crappy movies 
[01:08:00]  Yeah, we like The Rock  He puts out like  Some crappy movies  But he's at least good  But he acts in it  In it, yeah, yeah  He realizes that he has to act  Next time they're coming in  I'm not  I'm going to deny  I said anything  Is he not a good actor?  Once you're in a film though  Like, you realize  How much goes into it  And I've got so much more  Sympathy for like  People that try to make  I'm trying to do it  And I'm like  Damn, this is hard  Did you have a hard time  Remembering lines?  Yeah, actually  I definitely  I was like  I got the script  And I was too nervous  To pick it up 
[01:08:30]  I didn't know what to do  With it  I was like, oh god  Because I never read  Red lines before  And Steven didn't put me  With an acting coach  How do you remember them?  That's exactly what I was like  Yeah, yeah  Her shaky paper  Sorry  The actors kind of  Sat down with me  And, you know  Oh, they did  Yeah  And they said, look  You're wasting money  Remember these  Stop forgetting this stuff  It's important  That would be funny  If they were all dicks  Just yelling at you  Like that  The entire time  Yeah  That would be terrible  Her first take  She makes a mistake  And Michael's like 
[01:09:00]  What the fuck?  Everybody treated you well  Yes  Yes  So you liked that  Better than fighting?  Well, if you would have  Asked me that nine years ago  When I started fighting  I don't think  I mean, I think it would be the same  Where do you live?  Vegas  Oh, you're in Vegas  Okay  I thought you were going to go  That's a creepy question  What?  The way he asked it  Was creepy  Thank you  I'm sorry  You can't say like  So where are you from?  Yeah, yeah  You're like  Where do you live?  Oh, sorry  Let me do it a little slicker  So, where do you hail from?  That's creepy 
[01:09:30]  I'm like a director  And fucking  With a heart on it  In my fucking slacks  This is more honest  You were ready to Google map it though  No, I'm just curious  I don't go to Vegas  Oh, God  You like Vegas?  I love it  I grew up there since I've been  Oh, you did?  Wow  You stay away from the gambling?  Odd  Actually, interesting you said that  I was in a poker tournament  Randy Couture's poker tournament  For his GIA foundation  That's not gambling as much as you  It was to me  It's the second time I did it  And I got down  There was like probably 230 people there  And I got down to the last two tables  Wow  Oh, wow  That's pretty good  Not bad  And now I'm kind of addicted to it  I really want to 
[01:10:00]  Invite me to more poker tournaments  Yeah, that's not going to end well  One of my house on Friday  I find myself avoiding it completely  It's scary  Why?  Because of what you just said  She played in one or two tournaments  She's like, you know, it's kind of fun  It's addicting  I want to do it more  Poker is like  Oh, is that where they get you?  Poker is really like addicting  Yeah  And fun and just  But it's more of a sport  It's very social  There's a sport to it  It's different than playing other table games  In a casino like Blackjack or Roulette  Or something like that  It's very social  It's fun  It's a slower pace  You have a lot of say in what goes on 
[01:10:30]  So it's just  It is a lot of fun  I find poker players  Because there was two sitting at my table in the beginning  They're just super competitive with each other  Oh, man, yeah  They just sit there and mess with each other  Crazy  Trying to get under each other's skin  And then they both get out  Because they're too involved in this ego clash  And I'm sitting there smiling like  And you're like, ha ha  There we go  Down the final two tables  And that's the problem  Everyone's looking at your smile  Instead of focusing on their cards  Actually, that's been kind of a blessing in my life  The smile?  Well, no  Just people not taking me seriously  Oh, yeah, yeah 
[01:11:00]  Well, see  Now, your persona here  I would picture you walking in the ring  And going like  Alright, let's just not hurt each other  And it's going to be fun  And, you know  Just keep it  I don't know, whatever  But obviously  That isn't you  Where do you get that  That  Eye of the tiger, if you will  Once you get in the ring  I don't know  It's the  There's certain things in my life  That push me to a place  That  And I think that's why I like it  Uncle Paul  No 
[01:11:30]  Oh, boy  Jesus  Oh, baby  There's certain things in my life  That push me to a certain place  And I think fighting  That's why I like that  Is because it actually makes me delve into  Getting there  And so  And nine years ago  The sport wasn't really as big as it is now  Yeah  What kind of pushed you toward that  Instead of like maybe boxing  Or more traditional  Well, I think that  Females are naturally like full-bodied creatures  Yeah, they are  You know  I'll say  We want to use any type of trickery  To get out of a bad situation 
[01:12:00]  And I think that  MMA really works well with that  Like  That's why I think that  Female boxers don't get enough attention  Because it's so upper body  And men are like  Men are more strong in their upper body  But I think MMA is a perfect outlet for females  Because we're like  If you ever wrestle around with a girl  They're constantly using everything  To get out of a situation  Oh, man  Sure  Unless the rookie kicks in  Pepper spray  We couldn't get that joke out quick enough  We're terrible people  But it's  What drove you into fighting?  Was it because you wanted to protect yourself? 
[01:12:30]  Yay  Yay  She's a good girl  No, I just kind of found it  Through an ex-boyfriend  Who's actually  You know, still a good friend of mine  And we were drinking  Forties of Old English one night  And he realized  Oh, boy  It's always bad  Oh, boy  There's a problem between each other  I don't think I should drink a quarter of that  But so he decided to walk into a gym the next day  And be sober for a year  And I would go in and watch him  Because I wasn't ready to give up my old E just yet 
[01:13:00]  And then I went in and watched him  And I was like, okay  Maybe I'll start this  And I did  And five months later  I'm fighting in this, like, San Francisco gym  With, like, no air conditioning  Like, 300 people packed  Just, like, standing on chairs  Because the ring was on the floor  And it was just kind of like  Show up and fight whoever is, like, your size  And females  That's crazy  That's crazy  It was totally, like, Fight Club  But I realized, like, once I got through that one  And I did really well  Like, oh, I can do this  Did you have a reaction the first time  You get belted in the face?  That's a jarring experience 
[01:13:30]  I think, well, I started sparring with females  In my gym  And at first, when you start sparring  You don't have any control  So you're using everything  And so I bloodied three of the girls' noses  And then they're like, okay, no more girls for you  You had to fight with guys  Were you just windmilling?  Well, I thought that was the whole point  I didn't know at the time  That sparring, you have to use control  So then, I don't know  So then they put me with the guys  And I definitely got, like  I've been hit so hard on my life  To where I'm just trying to catch up with my head  Do you have a  Because you're a Muay Thai kicker, right? 
[01:14:00]  Is that how you say it?  Yeah, I'm a Muay Thai fighter  And you have  Does that mean that your shins are all from  You kick other shins?  No  I've got pretty decent shins, you know  Are they calloused?  I don't want to be kicked in the shin  Mine hurt when I'm on the top step of a ladder  Yeah, I don't want to  They're like, ow, the ladder's hurting me  It's weird  I'm such a pussy  People come, because I put a bag up in my garage  And people come over and try to kick that  And the first thing they do is wince  And I'm like, really?  That hurts me?  Wow, really?  Yeah, those guys, Muay Thai fighters are the worst  Because they kick really hard 
[01:14:30]  Yeah, they kick right  And not afraid to hit bone on bone  Mike H3 on Twitter writes  Gina's voice is as  Is her voice as hot as she is?  Holy crap  Is she as hot as her voice, they're saying?  Yeah, I guess he's  That guy's flustered  Well, your voice  Toronto voice  Is as hot as she is  Holy crap, okay  I'm sorry  They already know you're hot  And now they're hearing the voice  And they're just out of their minds  Okay, I got it  Thank you  Thank you  Was your voice a point in the movie?  Did they dub your voice? 
[01:15:00]  They definitely  Steven altered it  They altered it?  Yeah  Oh, I heard about that, yeah  Why?  It's like, it's supposed to be  Like, everybody's trying to make this  A big scandal  We're not lying to anybody  They definitely altered it  I don't know  Like, is there anything wrong with my  No, that's what I'm saying  Probably because you're sweet sounding  I know, I think that was  What, just to  To go with the character maybe  Or something?  Yeah, that's  Yeah, they wanted it  Mallory King  That's movie magic  Why are they making a big deal about that?  I'm cool with it  Yeah  I'm good  Is it weird watching yourself  With a different voice?  That would kind of freak me out 
[01:15:30]  No, I mean  I watched the movie once  And so  I'm kind of like  I'm going to give myself  That first experience  To kind of get in the door  I don't know if I want to really watch it  A million times over  Because it's really kind of strange  Watching yourself in general  Yeah, I hate watching myself  This stuff  I do, I really like that  Do you like watching yourself fight?  Like home movies?  Exactly  Once I make out my webcam  While I'm watching porn  That nobody else wants to see  Do you  Oh boy, that wrong angle  It's just up to your stomach 
[01:16:00]  And your fat neck  It's truly horrible  I think Ellen DeGeneres  Said something about  People who  Like film themselves having sex  She says they either  Really, really like it  And they're like sitting there  Complimenting each other  Or they're just  Tearing themselves to shreds  So you're the latter  No middle ground  Do you know  My ex-girlfriend and I  We filmed ourselves having sex  And she was all fun about it  And all I'm doing  Is just watching myself  And I'm tearing myself apart  And I'm like  It looks like you're fucking a fish  That's a terrible video  And she's like  Oh come on  I love you  I'm your girlfriend  It's fun  You know  I mean  She was into the spirit of it  She was watching herself 
[01:16:30]  She liked the way she looks  Oh yeah  Exactly  Girls are troopers, man  She was just a great actress  Because I go  I am just  I was so down on myself  I go  I look fucking horrible  And she couldn't even go  No you don't  She goes  Oh  I'm like  That's the best you could do  Miss supportive  Well it's kind of scary  Being out there now  Like  There's no fun play  On cell phones anymore  Because everybody gets caught  With that stuff  There is  But you just never  Everybody  How does that happen  Like the  The phone companies  Or something 
[01:17:00]  I think it's  People being a little  Loose with their phone  And being kind of stupid  Yeah  Or do you think  They do it on purpose  Oh disgruntled exes  Oh god yeah  Stuff like that  I've never blown somebody up  Like that though  No matter how bad  A relationship went  I've never ever revealed  Stuff people have told me  That's just dirty  It's a bad karma to do it  Yeah  Yeah  Really bad  I've played voicemails  On this show  People are  That's different  It was bad karma  To begin with  That's not  I was the bad karma  That's very bad  Turns out

[01:18:00]  I was  I was very  I was bad  But not in like a  Sexually promiscuous way  No I mean just like  Going out and stuff  Like I did everything else  But I wasn't like a  Drugs  No  No  Maybe some  Maybe just some old E  Maybe an old E  Yeah if I was drinking old E  Now how did you get  How did you acquire a taste  For old English  Just the people  I mean Las Vegas  Is kind of  I guess it's kind of  A small town right  Yeah  It's not this huge city  Yeah  What's wrong with Heineken

[01:21:30]  But they can give it back  So  Yeah that's true  Alright  So what are we going to do  Which kind of  I'm just going to  Squeeze your throat real quick  She's just going to  Pretty much serial killer  Choke you  Hold on  Okay  I love it too  Believe me  But this is not even  She's putting a choke  Who else did this one  This kind of choke on me  Are we ready  Yes we are  Oh god  I love the sound  It's okay  Yeah it's okay  I love that sound

[01:33:30]  I want you to talk  For like two minutes  Because we were talking  At the bar  The other night  And you were talking  About this island  Oh in Yemen  Yeah  Socotra Island  Do you hear about this island  No  Where shit grows  On this island  That doesn't grow  Anywhere else  It grows  It's this little island  Like a hoarder's house  You gotta look up  The pictures online  Look up Socotra Island  It's incredible  Oh boy  You just told Sam  To spell Socotra  I don't know  Can you spell it  No no no  You spell it 
[01:34:00]  S-O-C  Explain the island  Before the pictures  Come up  Basically it's an island  Off the coast of Yemen  It's about 200 miles  Off the coast of Yemen  And there's this  Vegetation there  And these trees  That grow there  They're called  The dragon blood trees  And it's the only place  In the world  Where it grows  Look at this  It looks like huge mushrooms  Is there a black cloud  Look at these  Cloud monster  Whoa that's like  Prehistoric shit  It is  It is  And the people there  Have blonde hair  Blue eyes  Because they're  Supposedly  Descendants of  Alexander the Great 
[01:34:30]  Because apparently  He stopped there  Somehow  And the vegetation  It's the only place  In the world  Where this stuff grows  That's crazy  Has anyone tried  To take some of these trees  And plant them somewhere else  I don't think so  I want to go there  I'm going to go there  He wants to go there  But they have to deal  With pirates  We have to go to Yemen  First  Yemen is not  A good place  Show them that tree  On the top corner  Wow that looks like  And then they got  These things  Well get out of here  What's that  Isn't that crazy  That's like shit  That grows out of potatoes 
[01:35:00]  If you leave them in the  What the dark  Or something  It's absolutely  Like a prehistoric look  To this place  But it's real  It's amazing  Yeah  That's fucking cool  And there's no  Because I think  UNESCO declared it  Like a world heritage site  So it's now  Protected  I mean as best  It can be  But the beaches  Are amazing  The girls  I know  Oh  I don't know  I thought you said  The beaches  Wow what's that  Yeah but look  I mean it's like nothing  There's no other place  In the world like this  Look at this weird shit  Well they look like  Giant carrots 
[01:35:30]  It looks like there's  A lot of rocks though  That wouldn't be fun  If you're walking around  There's a picture of shells  Did anyone do nuclear testing  Here at some point  Maybe the Rooshkis  And do they explain  Why this is the only place  Where this stuff grows  I don't know  No they don't  I haven't been there yet  So I don't know  And you're not really allowed  To be on this island  But you've got connections  Yeah I have a connection  And I'm going to go there  And you have to camp out  Because there's no hotels  There's no nothing  So  So camping's fine  Camping in Yemen 
[01:36:00]  What's wrong with camping  It'll be great  Camping in Yemen  Yeah good luck there  But that's where you want to go  That's pretty cool  And look  Oh no  There was one picture  Of his shells  I don't know where it was  Damn look at that thing  Look at that one  I don't know  That's a fucked up place  That looks like another planet  It does yeah  Look it up online  Because I've never seen  Anything like that  Before in my life  Socotra Island  If you could spell it  I'm going to go there  You think that shit's from space?  I don't know if it's from space  Think that shit's from space? 
[01:36:30]  Well think about it  If it's the only place it grows  Why?  You've got to think  Some seeds dropped  From somewhere  I think some prehistoric shit  Went on there  Look at the bird  Yeah they also have  These interesting birds  Damn look at that  Yellow vulture face  Looking thing  Looks like a sick chicken  Bye Jonathan  Have a nice flight  Kenny's kicking you out  Kenny you're messing up  Good radio right now  No you guys can do  Much better radio  Without his bulge  Oh man  I guess Jimmy  Probably wants to get  A move on  Yeah  He gets very nervous

[01:37:30]  Vaughn was there  It was good  I didn't hear what Dick said  Because we were following you around  Oh god  And pointing and laughing  Point and laugh  Bye guys  Jonathan stands like a tripod  Oh god  Oh jeez  Oh my  I have a friend  He used to call me that  The tripod  Alright Jonathan  Take it easy man  That's one of Jimmy's guys  Imagine having a big dick  That can't get hard though  That'd be like  Oh boy  Just flops there  Yeah like 
[01:38:00]  Because girls would be looking  Through the pants  Going like  Holy shit  Big dick  And then like  It doesn't get hard  Well  Jay Moore man  Put it all in perspective  Because like  If I pull my pants down  Right now  Whatever  But when it fucking grows  Ready for action  I'm good  And Jay Moore came up with  Is it a grower  Or a shower thing  Yeah yeah  Where some guys  They're just like  But when it gets hard  It's the exact same size  Right  And others  It's like putting that shit in water 
[01:38:30]  It's just  What is that shit  What is it  What the  It comes in a little capsule  And you put it in water  And next thing you know  It takes up your whole bathtub  Sam knows  And you get all sorts of shapes  For the kids  Dinosaurs  Oh see  I  They like dinosaur ones  It's a tiny little capsule  You put it in the  In the tub  Oh and then they grow  Into life size animals  Yeah that  Oh they come in little pills  That's not really good  You shouldn't  They look like Viagra pills  And then next thing you know 
[01:39:00]  It's a big dinosaur  In your fucking bathtub  So the capsule dissolves away  And then the thing like  Grows into something  A scream mask over there  Fuck  I gotta get this  For the kid  What if you eat one of those  You can't shit out a sponge  It might clean you out  Right  Yeah it would just  Like sponge your intestines out  It would just push everything down  I would assume  I don't know  I'm so constipated  I don't know  Well without Jimmy  It's obvious  We gotta go home now Sam  Yeah yeah  We did a fantastic podcast  We did two podcasts so far today 
[01:39:30]  You're not podcasting  You do a radio show  Everyone else is podcasting  So officially we're now podcasting  And we've done two  People podcast  Because nobody will hire them  To do radio shows  What?  Is that what's happening?  Yeah  I don't like all the praise  Some of these guys are getting  Like oh my god  That week  That one hour podcast  You did  Yeah  Oh my god  It was just amazing  Oh yeah  An hour a week  Wow  Wow  If you can't have an amazing podcast  If you do it once a week 
[01:40:00]  For an hour  For an hour  You can do a half hour too  So we've done two podcasts  So run  Run  The second half of this show  Next week  And we're good  This is a topical  Timely radio show  That people  You know  Yeah  They need  Every day  Every day  People are talking about Colbert  Was it Colbert  Or was it  John Stewart  Doing the baby bird  Stewart  Yeah  John Stewart  And this is why  I yell and scream  At every chance I get  Because it's nonsense 
[01:40:30]  What these people around here  Do to us  We're not allowed to do baby birds  Or any of that shit anymore  But now they're doing it  On big time TV shows  Yeah  I want their lawyers  It was barely  People are like  Oh  And it was barely  But I want their lawyers  Because their lawyers  Could get things done  Yeah  They allow them  Yeah  Yeah  I guess it was that chef  What's his name  I don't know  The blonde guy  The  I don't know  If he's not  You know  If he's not a rock and roll chef 
[01:41:00]  I'm not interested  Sam you might not like Guy Fieri  But I'm a fan of the Guy Fieri  It wasn't Guy Fieri  It wasn't Gordon Ramb  It was Mario  Mario Batone  Holly  Who's Mario Batone  Is he the Italy guy  I don't know  Who's he  He's the guy  That you take  You take the trip to Italy  Oh no  That's  Per  Per  Per  Per  Perillo  Perillo  Oh not that guy  Perillo tours  Perillo tours  That's where you go on a ship  It sinks halfway in the water 
[01:41:30]  And  You think that might have been  A Perillo tour  I wonder if that was like  Included on a Perillo  Mario Batali  Yeah  That guy  The fat blonde haired guy  He did a baby bird  To John Stewart  Stop  So yeah we heard about it  And my first thought is  Wow they have  They have good lawyers  Yeah see  What he did was  He chewed up some eggs  And went to spit them  In John Stewart's mouth 
[01:42:00]  But John Stewart kind of moved  And a little piece went in his mouth  I don't even know if a piece  Went in his mouth  I think a little piece  A little bit  He owns 14 restaurants  Written 8 cookbooks  His latest book is called  It's like 7 minutes long  Fuck that  What else we got to do  A motogusto  Just cause Jim's gone  Doesn't mean you guys  Don't have to do a show anymore  Oh we're doing a show  Oh we're doing a show  Good that's the attitude  You gotta go  Oh  Oh  Sam  There's no oh Sam here  There's no oh Sam here  There's always an oh Sam  I remember he was kind of 
[01:42:30]  In a chef outfit  Wasn't he  I don't know  Maybe he came back  Oh boy  Oh Sam  Why didn't you go  Right to the end end  Because it was an end of the  End of the segment  Wouldn't it be on YouTube  John Stewart  Fucking  Of course it would  Just that part  Alright here we go  We're going to YouTube then  Oh Sam  Oh Sam  There's no oh Sam  There is an oh Sam  Now we gotta make believe  We have something else  To talk about besides this  Oh Sam  Oh Sam 
[01:43:00]  Well this wasn't  On the rundown today  Well that's what this show is  It's uh  You know  You gotta think quick  On your feet  Fly by the seat  Of your britches  That's right  Yeah  It's not here  Oh Sam  No  Oh God  Full episode  Videos  What are you  What are you doing  And can I ask you  Something about politics  Please do  John Huntsman  Yeah  Is uh 
[01:43:30]  Out of the race  Dunsky  And he endorses  Mitt Romney  But  But  I tweeted yesterday  He  Two weeks ago  Said that he's  Unelectable  As president  Yeah they do that  Well it's stupid  It is stupid  What he did say though  Was  He goes  They have a lot of points  They don't agree on  Right  But he said  He does believe  That  Um  Mitt  Can  Unseat Obama  But then  And that's why  He's backing him  Just for the most part  What every other  Republican's doing 
[01:44:00]  Just vote for somebody  That we think  Might get rid of  Obama  And because  People are  Probably yelling  At their radios  Now  Both sides  Do this  And it drives me  Nuts  You know  Fight like cats  And dogs  Like what  Hillary and Obama  Certainly had their  Moments  Right  That was it  By the way  Sam  Oh we're back to this  Oh  Sam  No that's  Mediite  Mediite  I know what  Mediite  Both sides do it  Obviously Hillary Clinton  And Obama  Went at it  During the primaries  And now they work together 
[01:44:30]  Nice  Yeah  But I don't like  I don't like my politicians  Doing that  Yeah  You could step out of the race  And then just step out  You don't have to yell and scream  After you're out of the race  But just chill out  And fucking get a tan somewhere  I'd like to know  Which one is the lie  Were you lying  When you said he was unelectable  Right  Or are you lying  By saying you  You know  You make a good president  And you're  Right  Endorsing him  One of them's a lie  I really do have a problem  With that  But they think  Nothing of doing  Nothing of  Of doing this  Well as long as it works 
[01:45:00]  They do it every election  And the American people  Seem to forget  I know  It doesn't matter  But as  People are dumb  As potential voters  Don't people  Get mad at that shit  Some people  Others though  Just go  Yeah  You think when Newt  Finally  You know  Bails  He's gonna like  Endorse anybody  He will endorse  The front runner  You think he'll  Officially endorse  The front runner  He might be the first one  That does it  Yeah  With him  I don't know  But  I would respect him  If he doesn't  They've done it though 
[01:45:30]  They've all done it  I know they all do it  And I know both sides  Do it  And I've never liked it  I think it's kind of ridiculous  Makes it look stupid  It does  It's like you just said  Yeah  What is  What's the truth there  Where's the lie  What is the truth there  I don't know  Oh Sam  We got it Sam  Yes  Why would we do this  This is like a video clip  We do radio  I don't know  I'm not suggesting you do it  I'm finding whatever you talk about  All I know is  I'm looking at your screen  And you're ready to push play  Why  Because you asked for it 
[01:46:00]  Anthony asked for it  I meant you  As in the collective you  I just said that  They have better lawyers than us  Yeah  Oh my god  Why are we doing video clips  On the radio Sam  That's what we do  Yeah  Where did Iraq go  Oh there he is  Okay  He's just hanging out  I was hoping he was going  For a mid  Nice little shit  For himself  Mid show shit  The Iraq mid show shit  Iraq are you brewing  No I'm good today  You're good right now  Yeah I'm fine  Were you in the bathroom 
[01:46:30]  When I was in the bathroom earlier  No  Such  It is an amazing thing  Going on in that bathroom  On a daily basis  With all you guys  Well  What Iraq going in  And trashing management  Without checking the stalls  Oh yeah  That is shit  Pisses  That was awesome  Gary and mid dump  Had a fucking  Hey I'm here  Correct Iraq  Because he knew  I was about to go off  Troy and me were laughing  About that all day  On Friday  Really  Yes  About to unload  For the people that don't know  I was at the urinal 
[01:47:00]  And Iraq was at the urinal  And he  Iraq  And I kind of yelled at him afterwards  I'm like  Don't be as  Don't be so stupid  When you go in a bathroom  And you see a stall door closed  That is  That  You're playing Russian roulette  Yeah  It could be Mel Karmazin  Yeah  Yeah you don't talk  Yeah you don't  So  It could be a gap shot  I love the people  That just assume  Oh that person  In that stall  Taking a dump  Can't possibly be important  Even if they're not important  What if they're going to tell  Somebody who is important  It's not smart  To have gossip going 
[01:47:30]  When you don't know  Who's there  Right  So  Iraq goes  Hey just want to let you know  New posters  I'm  You know  I'm paraphrasing  New posters in the lobby  And guess what  You and Ant  Don't have  Still not there  You don't have your faces  In the lobby  They even have one for Jason Ellis  He says  They even  Even as if  You take that up with Jason  But that does make sense  It's like  They even have one for Jason Ellis  Is  Like I agree with Iraq on that  Like why do they have one for Jason Ellis  Jason's on our channel 
[01:48:00]  Right  Kind of  Which would make it even worse  Kind of  Okay fair enough  Is  Maybe  Could be  I have no idea what's on this channel  Outside of fucking 6 to 10  So I'm ready  I'm not even sure when the shit shows on  So I'm ready  After getting that knowledge  You know  It's right  In my stupid wheelhouse  I'm ready to go  Will you tell Gary  Yeah  But I couldn't even get that out  Because I hear this voice  From the stall  The post is coming next week  And it was Gary in the stall  So the post is coming next week  Which only means  If it was coming next week 
[01:48:30]  It's this week  It's a fucking  5 to 7 year old picture  They've not taken any new pictures of us  They're using the one that we took  At the Hard Rock  The reason they're not taking new pictures  They have taken new pictures of you  It's because you asked  They asked if you would take pictures  And you guys said no  Oh okay  That would be the answer to that  That makes good sense  I refused  That's good  Because I'm only going to look older  And uglier from this point  So I want to be like  One of those fucking newspaper columnists  Oh my gosh  I've gotten to the point where 
[01:49:00]  When Ann Landers' picture was from 1950  Yes  I've gotten to the point where  This is the picture you used for the rest of the career  That's it  Yes  Dorian Gray  Yes  Everyone does it  You don't want to take one with the beard now  That's your new shit  Beard's got it  The wife  Oh say the beard is  Oh that old gag  I used that joke Saturday  It was terrific  Everybody  Oh everyone just laughed and laughed  No  When's the poster coming  This week I guess  This week  As per the toilet stall 
[01:49:30]  Yeah  It is fishy  What's going to happen first  That  Jason Allen's got a poster  Even if he got it at the same time as us  That's fishy  Yeah  Why wouldn't our poster come  Why is it always  We're behind everything  It should have been us  And then  After like a year  Then Jason Allen gets a poster  But you're right  If all the new posters are coming in  Why wouldn't ours arrive with everyone  Why is it always  It's always a problem  When it comes to us  I don't know  But you know what I saw  Primetime Sam Roberts poster  That's right  Hanging in the lobby 
[01:50:00]  Well I do so much work  For the company at this point  It's about god damn time  The day I see that  I'm throwing Primetime Sam Roberts  Out the window  With this poster  Just throw me into another studio  I'll find out  I'll get my bearing  Maybe they  Fucking turn the mic on  And start talking  Maybe they're trying to figure out  What's wrong with the app  The online listening  That was another thing  That happened this weekend  I saw a lot of tweets  From fans of the program  That was saying  Yeah I got an app  And every other channel  On the platform is working  Except the Opie and Anthony channel 
[01:50:30]  That not working  Mars says that  That's an android problem  That's been solved  Like a robot  A robot  Is responsible for that  Why did it take three days to solve it  No the phone  Why did it take three days to solve it  It's a weekend  Who's working  Roscoe  It's the bed bug sniffing dog  Wow very good  That's a little local  Yeah can we have a  E-Rock mid-show shit stinger  That's a very good idea  Puddle of AIDS  Came up with that one 
[01:51:00]  I'm gonna go with the  Get a topical stinger  Well we used to have  The alarm clock  When E-Rock arrived  I think we fucking  Faded out of that right  Yeah  Can we go with the  Mid-show shit stinger  For a little while  Mid-show shit stinger  And you want this to go off  Immediately when E-Rock  Leaves there  As soon as  As soon as somebody  Gets word that he's  Taking his mid-show  Even if it's  Interrupting commercials  Okay  Yeah that is good  I don't care if we're  I'll fire it before I go  I don't care if we're  Doing the last interview  With Muhammad Ali  Right  Yes  Okay 
[01:51:30]  You hit that stinger  It'll be ready tomorrow  When he's doing  The mid-show shit  Yes the mid-show shit  What type of imaging  Are you thinking  Is this like  Cause we got  We want a very hip  Kind of black guy  You know voice  For getting topical  With the sex man  Are we thinking  Like a pretty girl voice  For the shit thing  I'm thinking  A juxtaposition  Oh yeah  Where there's a nice voice  But also just  Horrendous noises going on  Yeah  Is that a juxtaposition  Officially  Yes  The noises would be great  Troy has 
[01:52:00]  Sound clips of his shit  That he always sneaks  Into as many pieces  Of production as he can  And it's really his shit  Yep  And he tries to get it  Into as many pieces  Of production as he can get it  Is that his Hallmark card  Yeah he's put it  Into a whole bunch  Right under your noses  It's like Hitchcock  You know  Or those directors  That do little cameos  In their own movies  Yeah  He likes doing a cameo  Of his shits  Like he'll throw it in  Under a bunch of  Other noise and stuff  But it's always there  It's there  Why isn't our poster up  Everyone else's poster's up  Yeah man 
[01:52:30]  Alice looks fucking  Like a rock star out there  E-Rock  What's your theory  On the poster thing  Cause why wouldn't  Our poster arrive  With everyone else's  I don't know  That's why  I was telling you about it  Unless it was  A second thought  Kind of thing  And they went  Uh oh  We better get this poster  Cause you know  These assholes  And if all the posters  Are already up  Like where is ours  Supposed to go  That's the question  Who's coming down  Like who's coming down  There's not even  A space for us  There's no spot 
[01:53:00]  It's like showing up  For Hollywood Squares  Looking at all the squares  Can you go to the hall  And talk to that asshole  And get some info on this  Yeah me or Eric  It's too late  Cause now they're on to us  Cause Jason  Now he's got  He's got 60 seconds  To come up with some  Lame ass reason why  You want me to go ask him  Yes of course  We're on though  Now  Someone has to come down  In order for us to  Go up  Well  E-Rock knows more  About the posters than me  Is there a spot for us  Uh  There's  There's six spots out there 
[01:53:30]  I believe  Yeah and they're all  Who got the big six spots  Um  Well  I'm only remembering three  At the top of my head  But I know Howard has one  Howard?  Rosie?  I  No  No I don't think Rosie has one  I don't think she's on here anymore  Is she?  No  She left  She took their money and ran  Oh man  Well  God bless her  Waddled  The ones I remember  Howard  Jason Ellis  And J. Thomas  J. Thomas  J. Thomas  J. Thomas  We're so taking his spot  Legend in the business  What?  When?  I have no idea  Where?  Who?  And who else?  There's three more  I don't know  I don't remember who the other three are 
[01:54:00]  Oh oh oh oh  Martha?  No no  We got uh  How about  We got mad dog  Chris Russo  I think I saw Chris Russo out there  In uh  On the big poster board  Sam's running  Uh oh  Ew  He runs like a girl  He runs like a girl  He jog  Ew look at his dumb jog  You run like a girl  Oh god  I wish you could see this  Oh look how stupid he looks  Why you run like that?  You run like a girl  You run like a chick  Doing a little jog 
[01:54:30]  No I don't  Yeah  Oh man  Yes  Well that's a good answer  You got an answer?  Yes  Alright  The uh  Wait wait wait  Before you give us the answer  How was the vibe?  It was like  Sort of like  Alright  I know I'm getting my balls busted  But it's part of the gig  You know  You think he believes me  When I say  Ah it's just for the show?  Yeah  Yes he does  I don't  But he does  Now I love  Letting everyone in on my excuses  Over the years  I've done very well with 
[01:55:00]  Ah it's just for the show man  Don't worry about it  For the show  It's so not just for the show  Okay  He doesn't get that the phony part  Comes after the show  Yeah  Right  Yeah  Yeah  A lot of people don't understand that  Why was that perfect?  And Roland is imitating  Someone that works here  Yeah  Yes  So  He said the posters  Are rotating  He said there's only  Oh so when Howard comes down  I guess  Well that's funny  What?  You said that  What do you mean they're rotating?  Why is everything so complicated? 
[01:55:30]  He believes  He's not sure  So  Where's our poster?  We get ours when  It's like odd even license plates for fuel  What happens?  Every Wednesday  Every Wednesday and Friday  Is Opie and Anthony Day  What do you mean rotating posters?  It's not concrete  He's not positive  That means  If you could change the poster  That means  You could decide  When you finally  Throw O and A a bone  And put their poster up  It's like  Hey guys  Look  Look  Your poster's up  Probably  Oh good  Probably after hours 
[01:56:00]  Yeah yeah yeah  He believes Howard is the only permanent fixture  Of course  Why  Although  Why would his rotate too?  Jay Thomas and Cousin Brucey have been there forever  Oh Cousin Brucey's up there  Jay Thomas  Isn't Mad Dog Russo up there?  Yeah  Those have all been there forever  Yeah yeah  The whole time  They've never rotated  The fucking posters  What does rotating mean?  That is not true  Meaning they have to open up the glass  And put our poster in  It's not a digital rotation  No it's not  It's physical  Oh this place could suck  They'll probably just take out Alice's  And put us out  But there's a 
[01:56:30]  A proof of the poster  That he's got to show you today  I don't believe it  After the show  And if you approve the proof  That poster should be up by the end of the week  Why couldn't it go up immediately?  In rotation  In rotation  Why is our poster last?  You and Alice going back and forth  Why is our poster last?  Yeah why?  Why?  Well  If that doesn't explain everything  I mean  It's just  The lack of respect 
[01:57:00]  Is astounding  Eminem's up there  Eminem's up there  He doesn't even work here  No he doesn't work here  At least throw a hook at a bone  Yeah right  Eminem's orders up there  How about the people that fucking actually are in the studio?  Why is Eminem's face up there really?  Shave 45  Eminem's channel  It doesn't work there  How long has it been since he was Slim Shady?  It's been a while  It's been a while  Why are they called Shave 45?  Because he's Slim Shady right?  Right  Well now it's just silly  It's a little goofy 
[01:57:30]  It's like calling this the fucking bra bombing channel  I guess it's because Mathers 45 doesn't carry the same weight in him  Mathers?  Mathers  It's like a leave it to beaver channel  Yeah exactly  I don't know  A guy that doesn't even work here gets a poster  Yeah  And we might have a poster  God  I think Eminem's a PD  What's up with the poster for real?  That's it  What does he mean by rotating posters?  Like they take one out  They put another in  I've never seen anyone take a poster out of there  Alice 
[01:58:00]  This is amazing  How pissed is Alice going to be when his poster doesn't last two weeks out there?  Because we're rotating it  We're rotating it  You should find out who you're replacing  Go ahead  Go ask  I don't know if he knows  He doesn't know shit  He might know  He doesn't know anything  No no  This is what you are being fed  You're being fed a line of shit  Yeah you still have a lot to learn  To try to appease us  Yeah  Yes  See because if they  They could get a poster of us to keep us calm 
[01:58:30]  But then they control when it's actually up there  And then it'll be up there just enough for us to know we can't really complain  And then it'll slowly fade away and just be what it really is  The second the elevator door is shut at 10.01  There's a fucking maintenance guy with a ladder running  Running to the poster board  And it's only up there from 9.50 to 10.01  Right, right  When we walk down the hall  Just in case we leave early  And there'll always be someone in lower to mid management  Stand there while we go and go 
[01:59:00]  Ah, ah  And point that and go  Ah, ah  Then Rosie gets put right back up  Oh yeah, Rosie  This guy's screaming  I can see he's screaming  Because I can read  I can read text  You read a scream?  Unlike Iraq can  Callback from earlier  Tommy from Brooklyn  You guys haven't even seen a proof?  Yeah  No  Why are all the new posters up  And we haven't even seen the proof of ours?  Yeah, did they all see proofs?  Did Jason see a proof?  I would assume so  That must have been weeks ago  I love that Gary 
[01:59:30]  His mental state is such  That he really thinks he's just  In charge like  Of a medium market morning show  Because this bullshit would work  Oh, I know  On a medium market morning show  Right, he'd be king of a medium market morning show  But we've been through a lot of bullshit  Like what's a ringer  What city is a medium market?  I always go to Des Moines  He's like  Des Moines  Des Moines was a really good media market  Radio market  You know, a good place to go 
[02:00:00]  To try to, you know, hone your skills  Don't treat me like I just got into the nom  Right  Like I've been here a while  Right  I know what it's fucking like  To be in country  More bullshit  We haven't even seen a proof  And the new posters are already up  So that means he's either like slacking  Which I probably would have to believe  Do you think so?  Or they have no intention of putting us up there  Well, we're in the rotation  You see a proof today  Is that exciting?  How about we see a proof of last week?  Yeah 
[02:00:30]  E-Rock, how long have the new posters been up?  I only got  I don't know  Probably as early as last week  I only saw it towards the end of last week  Jason Ellis  Anthony, can you feel this question?  Sure  I want to see your intelligence on this one  Dave has a very important question  Dave  You know, if someone has a normal job  I can see where your bathroom thing makes sense  About, you know, you don't know who's listening  But for you guys  What could you possibly say that you don't say on the air? 
[02:01:00]  Or is it because they never listen to you on the air?  Oh, well  That's not quite the question he had  But  Yeah, no  You wanted to ask  What does it matter if you have a poster, right?  No  You got the wrong David, I guess  Oh  Someone who's screening  Who's screening  Who's screening the calls?  Did you bring back an intern?  That would be Danny  Oh  Oh  Danny Ross  You can answer mine anyhow  That was Danny on spot  Why this place is falling apart  I understand  What was his question though?  Back there  We say a lot of 
[02:01:30]  A lot of  Really just nasty shit  But then you have to see these people  So then  Over the years  I've honed this thing  Where I make believe  I'm just doing it to make good radio  And then they're like  Oh, okay  Oh, alright  That makes sense  Oh, I get it now  And then they'd like  Walk back to their cubicle  With a little hop in their step  Feeling good about themselves  They're part of the show  Do they get it?  Oh, yeah  Yeah  He'll climb in a secret every time  And I know Gary's rolling his eyes  Like, no  I ain't not  No, you don't  You don't know  You don't know  The extent of this 
[02:02:00]  The king of mind games  Oh  But now I'm trying to tell people  That, yeah  It is all bullshit  When I say off air  But that's where the lies start  Now it just doesn't even matter  Then off the air  You'll lie about it  Huh?  You'll lie about this  Off the air  And he'll be like  Oh  Well, to make them feel good about themselves  But now I've decided  Fuck that  You're not going to go with that anymore  Nah  Why make them feel good?  Why bother?  Oh  They suck at their jobs  Yeah  Who?  Period  Ouch  I don't know why I have to read tweets  For three straight days 
[02:02:30]  That the online app is fucked up  And  Exactly  A, not a phone call  An email  Or anything being done about it  It's only  And then I have to sit there and go  I don't even know if they know  Exactly  It only applies to shows  That have posters  I guess  If you complain about your app not working  And you have a poster  They'll fix it  If you don't have a poster  Bah  So Alice is good  Well  Alice is good  I don't really  And this is the truth  I don't really care if we  Do have a poster up in the lobby  But it's just the point of the whole fucking thing 
[02:03:00]  And the lack of  Respect  And it really does show  What we've always thought  They  You know  The posters show where you are  They don't really give a fuck about it  They show where you are on the spectrum  There's a lot of shows here  The top shows get posters  Half the names don't have top shows  One guy has a poster  He doesn't even fucking know where the building is  He'd probably get directions  When he comes here once maybe every two years  He actually has to like get in a car  And they drive him here 
[02:03:30]  He has no idea  Eminem doesn't know where this fucking building is  No way  It's out of his head  He probably owns it  Huh?  He probably owns the building  So he knows where it is  He doesn't know  He just cashes their checks  He probably doesn't even cash their checks  He doesn't even know he's getting a check from these people at this point  God  That would be fucking great  It's direct deposit probably  And he forgot about Sirius XM years ago  Right after he signed that damn thing  Imagine that  What did they get one interview with him backstage once  Since we've been here?  He was in this building once 
[02:04:00]  For sure  Since we've been here  For how long?  Yeah I don't know  20 minutes  They must have cleared the whole fucking floor out  Oh nobody  Yes  Nobody could  But he did an interview with Who Kid  That makes you feel good about your job  With certain people  Where you're doing a radio show  And other guys that do radio shows  Yeah  Are so much bigger than you  That you as a radio personality  Are not allowed to even look at them  Can't look at them  So they block off hallways  And set up barriers  And then I think like 
[02:04:30]  How insulting is that?  Maybe in 2010 or 2011  He had Presk come to Detroit to interview him  Yeah  And we were represented  So we didn't  Like not we this show  But this company  Shade45 did an interview with him in Detroit  Like last year  Detroit  The D  Yeah  I don't know where the D is  That's where fucking  People punch grandmas in the face  At Chuck E. Cheese's  When you try to tell  A table full of rabble 
[02:05:00]  To maybe not say fuck you  What happened?  In front of children  I thought you were talking about posters  Oh we were  What happened?  He mentioned Detroit  That lovely fucking city  And that got you going?  Yeah  Did you hear that story?  I heard about the cop punching the retarded girl  No that's a different story  Oh  That wasn't that Chuck E. Cheese?  No you gotta take the good stories with the bad ones  The Chuck E. Cheese  They balance each other out right?  In the day  Woman beaten  Why do I have to verify my age to see a cop punch? 
[02:05:30]  I don't know  You got the  Oh can we listen  Let's listen to the audio of this  Because it's the newscast  Of what happened at Chuck E. Cheese in Detroit  Okay  And try to guess  Let's try to guess  Maybe  The background  What these people might have looked like  I don't know  Just based on the newscast  Oakland University  Alright  Free academic support  More than 130 undergrad programs  130  Fewer than 30  They did fucking commercials 
[02:06:00]  Go learn  At Oakland  They just got a free commercial  On satellite radio  Go learn yourself  Yeah they did  Oh  Can you pause this for a second?  Cheese as many parents have  The first thing  Just to wrap up the poster discussion  Because now I know this is going to go in a whole different direction  Which is fine  Which is fine  But this has to be said really fast  Gary obviously created the poster last Friday  After you brought it up  Yes  Hence the proof today  Exactly  And then someone else is saying  Jason Ellis saw his proof weeks ago  Yeah  Oh no  So Gary in a panic went  Oh fuck 
[02:06:30]  I dropped the ball again  He's sitting on the bowl  Right when he heard your voice ready to go  His asshole slammed shut  And cut the shit into  He was mad  I got the poster  Now I got to run around like a lunatic  And try to figure something out  Yeah  They're on to the poster thing  So tell the guys with rotating posters  Rotating  That should keep them calm for a while  Put up another light box  Motherfucker  So he can get more posters on the wall  You think when he said  There's one coming for next week  There was none coming 
[02:07:00]  There was none  There's no way  That was fiction  The only thing that was coming  Was shit out of his ass  Irock you're on the radio  You're allowed to say whatever you want  New rule  It's true  That's our new rule by the way  Because you guys can just say stuff for the radio show  And not mean it  Go ahead Irock  Like you do  No  We're saying what we mean  Oh  I'm just trying to keep you boys safe  Thank you  Irock  I agree with that statement  Which statement  You think Gary wasn't telling the truth  I don't think there was a proof  Until we said something  It's only been two years  Only  Two 
[02:07:30]  Try we're up to two and a half  Yeah it's been more than two  Two in April is what  Two and over a half  Wow  We're pushing almost three years here  In a couple months  Holy shit  April will be three months  Three years in this building  Wow  All right back to your story  Oh there it is  Just so we wrapped up the poster discussion  I'm sure we'll get back to it  Yeah  Fuck yeah we will  Yeah  All right Chuck E. Cheese  Detroit  This is a blurb advertising a  And this is a quote  Safe wholesome environment 
[02:08:00]  With games, food and fun  In Detroit  Wasn't so safe or wholesome  At the chain's Dearborn location Sunday  Dearborn mission  When an argument between two parties  Became physical  Hank Winchester is the story  Of a brawl  That ended with a grandmother  In the hospital  Of course it did  Black reporter  This is where the big brawl took place  Inside the Chuck E. Cheese's  In Dearborn  Right after a little boy  Cut into his birthday cake  Fists started flying  These photos capture the fun  Taking place right before  The big fight broke out  They're white  It all happened here 
[02:08:30]  Sunday afternoon  Inside the Chuck E. Cheese's  On Michigan Avenue  In Dearborn  The victim  A Westland grandmother  Tells me she was punched  And dragged by her hair  As kids looked on  I just spoke with her  On the phone  He punched me in the face  And he drug me  By the back of my head  My hair  Okay so the victims were white  Everybody over the table  The victim's white  And the table landed on top of me  Is the perpetrator white?  Oh were you just assuming  This was a black story?  Yeah  Yeah  I thought it was  Because based on violence 
[02:09:00]  At Chuck E. Cheese  Yeah  And somebody saying something like  Don't curse in front of the kids  And then getting punched in the face  It just fits those  Stereotypical things  You realize you're in trouble  When they saw the white  When they did the white reporter thing?  Yeah  The white reporter  Because local news  They love to do this  If it's a story about  Blacks or whatever  They go with the black reporter  The black angle  And  You know what's fucked up though?  They made a point  Of showing that it was white people  Or at least the white victim 
[02:09:30]  And they're using like  Assault victim  Name withheld  But they have a silhouette  Yeah  Of the person  Yeah  And you can see it's white person  And they're tricking you  Because they're saying  She's a grandma  Yeah  So she might be a young grandma  Which would be totally okay  To drag across the floor  Of a Chuck E. Cheese  If she's acting up  No  I still don't know  Who the perps were  Alright let's go  Alright let's go  I'm hanging out  My mother was here  With family members  Celebrating her grandson's  Seventh birthday  She was upset  She said  Hearing foul language  At the next table 
[02:10:00]  Alright alright  Alright  What's wrong with this guy?  Now they showed  They insinuated  No no  There's two different things  Going on here  Why?  Back up  I can't get past  The guy's  S problem  Oh I was looking  At the black people  Inside Chuck E. Cheese  You don't hear this guy  In his S?  Oh yeah  I said he was very effeminate  At the beginning of the broadcast  But it's getting worse  Yeah  Alright  Now I'll look for  What you're looking at  See now watch  He says something  About what happened  And they show  Show  The black people inside  So this leads me 
[02:10:30]  To believe that  Maybe the perps  Were black  And the victims white  I'm not sure  Alright  Just based on this story alone  Oh  Sam  Oh Sam  I see a spinning wheel  She was upset  She said  Hearing foul language  At the next table  And she asked  The man and woman  Sitting there  To keep it down  Words were exchanged  And grandma  Took a beating  My grandson  And one of his schoolmates  Were next to me  Right next to me  When all of this happened  And I couldn't get up 
[02:11:00]  The grandmother  Was rushed to Oakwood Hospital  Sunday evening  She was shaken up  And bruised up  But otherwise  We'll be okay  The alleged attacker  Took off  Before police arrived on scene  The victim's daughter  Filed a police report  At Dearborn PD  Hoping to track down  The couple responsible  I was scared  All I could think  Was I needed to find my son  He's seven  And he was standing  Right there  I didn't know  Why are we looking  At her vagina  She doesn't want  To be seen  A spokesperson  At Chuck E. Cheese's  Corporate office  Would only tell us 
[02:11:30]  That they continue  To cooperate  With police  On the investigation  We're here in Dearborn  Hank Winchester  He's got frosted hair too  With a name like  Hank Winchester  And he talks like that  Inside the Chuck E. Cheese's  That captured the brawl  What?  Captured the brawl  Well where's the  Fucking surveillance video?  Well it'll come out  No dice  It'll get out there eventually  Yeah  But why did this  Channel 4 hire  Like that guy?  Because he had a name  Like Hank Winchester  And they said  Wow this guy's  Gotta be good  And then he turns up  To be like 
[02:12:00]  Oh  Is that some kind  Of PC shit?  Because I want my  News anchors  To talk properly  You need a good  Strong man  Very manly sounding  He sounded a little  Effeminate  He looked like  A young Ron Perlman  The effeminate part  Is fine  But you gotta at least  Like talk right  You're the news  Yeah  Sounds like the  Honey Badger guy  Exactly  Oh  Everyone's saying  Honey Badger  Okay  I don't give a shit  The Chuck E. Cheese  Rat doesn't give a fuck 
[02:12:30]  That fucker's crazy  Some asshole sent that  To me over the weekend  I'm like really?  Like you haven't seen it  Really at this point?

[02:13:30]  It's like either  The peace symbol  Or the worst  Fucking catastrophe ever  And nothing in the middle  Like ah  That occasionally  Ends up on  Party favors  And balloons  Yeah  Nope  So when do you think  We're gonna get our poster  Before or after  They fix the lights  In the studio  Oh no  That's never gonna happen  Or after they fix the app  Although they're probably  Finding out about the app  For the first time  This morning  Mars said the Android app  Was fixed  Who fixed it  Sounds like a really easy fix  So why did it take 
[02:14:00]  Yeah yeah  Why did it take  The whole fucking weekend  Unless you're  Very incompetent  Oh boy  Wow  That might be the problem  Let the record state  I do this just to get  The reaction out of SAF  I want that app  To be in competent hands  Oh we're all incompetent  I want to bring this up  Because Ant's on board  With this Chris Humphreys  Finally  Looking like a dummy  In a hot tub  Oh boy  Turns out  Chris Humphreys  Hump yo  They call him Hump  Have you watched more

[02:20:00]  But here's the fucking  Newer thing  That's a little strange  Yeah  That's been going on  That again  Remember when we used to sit here  With the lovely and talented  Patrice O'Neill  And uh  We would talk about  Uh  Uh  Celebrities  And how unattainable  They were  Years ago  When you had to  Uh  Clark Gable  You had to write them a letter  It had to get through  50 different people  It probably never got to  Clark Gable  And there was just no way  To get to these people  And it made them  Bigger than life  Right  Now with Twitter  I notice we all 
[02:20:30]  Tweet things about  The Golden Globes  And award shows  And stuff like that  But now you're getting  The celebrities  Tweeting pictures  Like it's me  At a bar  With my friends  Like  What do you mean  They're tweeting pictures  Of huge celebrities  And they're hanging out  And it's like  Here's a picture of me  And Spielberg  And it kind of  It makes it  Not as special  Doesn't it  When you're tweeting  About the Globes  No no no  It has nothing to do  With me tweeting  About the Globes  It's about  I really am confused  The celebrities

[02:24:30]  You know  A little like  Reaction shots  Elton John's  Sitting there  Elton goes off  Half cocked a lot  What do you mean  Wah wah wah  Because  He gets mad at something  And then yells out  His dumb opinion  And then a few days later  Realizes he was  Completely out of line  Or wrong  I mean when he called  What did he say  Was racist  Was it American Idol  Yeah  He said American Idol  Was racist  Really  And meanwhile  Like every champion  That's come out of 
[02:25:00]  American Idol  Has pretty much been black  He's an asshole  With that dumb wig  And his dumb  Sally Jessie glasses  Breaking news  Oh  Shock Jock  OP Radio  Challenges  Chloe Kardashian  To paternal DNA  Test for 250 G's  Whoa  Where is that  Let's pick that up  Isles win 86  Oh jeez  Is that it  It says breaking news  Periodical  Oh he's just  An Islander fan  From Hicksville  I figured that's what  Isles meant  Isles 
[02:25:30]  Yeah I'm not a fan  Of Elton John  I like some of his songs  But he just comes across  Like a real jerk  He is a jerk  Looks like he doesn't  Have a sense of humor  At all  No  Would you  Boy did  You know  Alright  The good lord  Gives him some talent  I think he's very talented  Not a lot of talent  Well you know what  Not for writing  But for performing  The songs  He's pretty good  Elton John  In that piano  Gets way more credit  I've said this for years  Way more credit 
[02:26:00]  Than he deserves  Well yeah  He doesn't write the songs  I know  But you know  When you're hearing  Daniel  Yeah  Someone wrote that for him  I know  But he plays it well  I like the guys  That write their own stuff  And sing their own stuff  That's way more talent  Than Elton John  Having a really good  Writing partner  Maybe that's what happened  He got this like  Fame  And then  The lord decided  You got too much fame  Because Bernie Taupin  Is the one that writes it  So I'm gonna make you gay  And then take all your hair  But he got his hair back 
[02:26:30]  And then  And gays  And then  And things  So  But it's like  So you didn't really  Fucking teach him a lesson  It did  Because the second  He got his hair back  Yeah  God made him fat  And old  He really is just  He was never  I don't think he was ever  Able to really enjoy  The gay life  You know  Because it all had to be  On the QT  Yeah  At first it had to be  On the QT  And now he's just  An old queen  Now he's open 
[02:27:00]  With that big ass  Hoping for takers  And they're like  Maybe 25 years ago  Yeah  So that's why he's bitter  And angry  But I've been saying this  About Bernie Taupin  Too for many years  How bad is his voice  That he couldn't sing  His own great songs  And is there audio  Of Bernie Taupin singing  Singing  Wow  Do you know  I don't know  He'd have to be so bad  You're right  That's what I'm saying  Because the songs  Are so good  A bunch of these  That even if you have  An average voice  You know 
[02:27:30]  They would be hits  I'm thinking  Now did he write  The music also  Or just the lyrics  Someone that knows  Way more about music  Than me could answer that  I don't know  We all know that  Bernie Taupin  Is his quote  Writing partner  Yes  But I think that means  That Bernie wrote  Just about all of it  Yeah  And then maybe  Elton John  Kind of  You know  Changed it slightly  Here and there  Jayster's saying  Taupin put out  One album  And Bobby's saying  Elton does write the music  Writes the music  So if you're writing  The words  And Elton's writing  The music 
[02:28:00]  You know  That's just as important  You could go  Blah blah blah  Blah blah blah  Blah blah blah  And it still sounds like  Wow that's a good song  Yeah but even I know  What you just did there  You just put a little  Piano behind that  You don't need a big guitar  That's all you need to do  Yes  Even I know that  If he put out an album  Do you have a song  In the system  I found one song  Called Born on the 4th of July  And it's Bernie Taupin singing  It's  I guess it's him  It sounds a little countryish  But it says Bernie Taupin  Alright let's hear it  Yeah let's turn down the 
[02:28:30]  Right  Marching  I hear marching  Outside my window  In the rain  The house next door  To me was  Checkers  I'm sick of checkers  I'm sick of pain  Now just imagine that voice  Sing a tiny dancer  Would it work?  Oh it's gonna rock out now  The hell just happened 
[02:29:00]  To this song  That was a horrible transition  The hell was that  They must have been high  Doing amyl nitrate poppers  And collapsing their asses  I hear marching  He's trying to get an Elton sound  Yeah I hear the Elton sound  In the rain  I'm playing checkers  I'm sick of checkers 
[02:29:30]  I'm sick of rain  Someone tweeting  I can't look at Twitter  During the show  I gotta stop  Black Rado3 writes  Chloe take Opiate Anthony's  $250,000 DNA deal  You big monster  A monster  She is a monster  I think this voice isn't bad  He probably could have had  A few hits with this voice  Might have been able to  He had no confidence though  But maybe he can't play  That piano  Do you need the piano 
[02:30:00]  For some of these songs?  You need piano  For so many Elton songs  But if you're Bernie Taupin  You come up with the great words  You can find a piano player  One of those guys  That's kind of in the dark  You don't need a spotlight on him  You stand there at the mic  Singing  You gotta be a really good singer  If you're just gonna stand at the mic  If you play piano  And you sing  Elton John  Does the piano and sing  At the same time?  Oh yeah  I just realized that  Yes  I just realized that  And you get a little latitude  With that  You ever see Elton John? 
[02:30:30]  Not live  No  There we go  I would have in the past  Now it's like  When am I gonna  He's got  Some Lion King songs  He's got a lot of songs man  Yeah  A lot of fucking songs  That you can't deny are good  Yeah  Alright that's our  Bernie Taupin  Elton John discussion  Yeah  We just pulled out of our asses  Sam  How great was that?  Much like  Elton pulls Bernie  Out of his ass  Or had  Were they ever lovers?  I don't know  I bet you they started out  As lovers  Lovers  That's probably why 
[02:31:00]  Bernie gave him the gig  And then they just  Had an understanding  After a while  I'll write some songs  For you Elton  I'll write some songs  Play my songs  Elton  Play my songs  Sam  Were they lovers?  I can't confirm or deny  What the fuck is this?  CNN  Someone's saying  Bernie Taupin  Has a great radio show  On the loft  I don't even know  If this guy's kidding or not  His poster's up in the lobby  It's great  He has a poster in the library?  Bernie Taupin  He's on rotation  Rotation 
[02:31:30]  Wait  Fuckers  He does a show for the loft?  Yes  Maybe it's a different  Bernie Taupin  No it's Bernie Taupin  There's only one?  That guy spells it with a B  Oh shit  No  Oh  Bernie Taupin  And does it say  He's the guy  With the Elton John?  Yeah  And what's this thing?  I know it  Not Birnbaum  Puts down the sewer  Why wouldn't you click on that?  Bernie Taupin's  American Roots radio promo  Yeah  Come on  Come on Sam

[02:32:30]  You will be healed  Does everyone work here?  Does everyone  That we can ever talk about  Actually get paid  By this company?  I like to show  What Bob Dylan  Was doing  He's addicting  As hell to listen to  Is he?  You never listen  To his radio show?  No I  Holy fuck 
[02:33:00]  Was it good  Dillon  I'm not a Dillon fan  Just not  You're a Mormon  Yeah  You have to be Mormon  No I just don't like Dillon  Oh yeah  We've done this break  Yeah  It's too weird  It's too  Not one song  That we go  Okay I like that one  Subterranean  The one that doesn't sound like him  Lear crawls my big brass beard  Subterranean  Homesick  Which one's that?  I don't even have to look at E-Rock  I know what he's gonna say

Yes  We've done this  And I think this is round three  Of doing this  Look dude  We've been out 17 years  We have nothing else to talk about  Sometimes we overlap  So we gotta just talk about  Stuff we already talked about  Yeah  Maybe hope that people never heard it  Or maybe make it a little better  Yeah 
[02:34:00]  See  Oh  I love this song  Yeah  We'll go on a break with this  We'll go on a break with this  Yeah  Yeah  We'll go on a break with this  We'll go on a break with this  We'll go on a break with this  We'll go on a break with this  Thank you  We'll go on a break with this  We'll go on a break with this  Thank you.

[02:35:00]  Thank you. 
[02:35:30]  Thank you. 
[02:36:00]  Thank you. 
[02:36:30]  Thank you. 
[02:37:00]  Thank you. 
[02:37:30]  Thank you.  Thank you. 
[02:38:00]  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you. 
[02:38:30]  Will I get fired if I shit in that garbage pail?  Huh?  Yes.  Why?  You can't have...  My bowels are acting up.  I understand.  I'd get fired, too, because I would leave early.  My bowels are acting up, and we just took a break, and now I feel like I've got to run down the hall.  My bowels.  Or be a company man and just shit right there.  Your bowels?  My bowels.  If you absolutely must move your bowels, you should go to the bathroom and let Anthony handle the show by himself. 
[02:39:00]  Move your bowels.  I've got to move my bowels.  That's disgusting.  I told my wife she wasn't thrilled about that.  Now moving your bowels?  I woke up yesterday morning and I said, man, my bowels are acting up.  I don't know what I ate, but it's like achy.  You can't talk about that.  I ate well, though.  I didn't go crazy with stuff.  Yeah, would you have a lot of cheese?  I had a lot of sushi. 
[02:39:30]  A lot of sushi.  Well, there's no turning back now.  Mentality Magazine and What Would Tyler Durden Do are running with the story.  So there's no turning back.  I have officially offered Kris Jenner $250,000 that she could give to her favorite charity if she could prove that Khloe Kardashian is certainly a Rob Kardashian creation.  Wow.  It's not a bet, though.  She doesn't have to give you if she's wrong. 
[02:40:00]  Ooh, man.  What do you like?  Do you like that angle?  Why would she agree to that?  Do you like that angle?  Yeah, but there's no turning back.  She knows.  Real places are picking up on this now.  She knows.  So why would she agree to that?  She's the one that knows.  Right.  You know?  Yeah, but why wouldn't she want to make a quick 250 Gs for her favorite charity?  Well, that's true.  If she knows.  There's got to be no risk for her.  That means if she doesn't do this bet, it's not Rob Kardashian's daughter. 
[02:40:30]  Because she knows what the sure thing is.  She's in a bad fucking place right now.  Yeah.  I'd say.  So she has to do this.  You have to do this now, Kris Jenner.  You have to do this.  But then you might be wrong and lose a quarter of a million dollars.  Let's not think about that part right now.  Because that would certainly not.  That's so much money, though.  That would be a major.  I mean, a major hit.  It's a lot of cake.  Yeah, it's a lot of money, dude.  And I'm sure our agent right now is like, oh, my goodness. 
[02:41:00]  How do you?  He doesn't care.  He got his 10% off of it.  Never mind.  He'll hear about this about a month from now.  Oh.  Talk about it.  Anyway.  Here's a picture of the poster, Zay.  Because I went out in the hall.  Let's see.  And I decided to study the poster wall.  All right.  I see.  Got a lot of guys that do part-time radio up there or don't do radio at all.  Howard, as we all know, is a part-timer now.  And I'm not trashing him.  I mean, I hope to get to that point someday. 
[02:41:30]  Oh, it would be great.  So we're not beating up on Howard.  He's had a great career.  And he's at a point now where he's a part-timer.  Plus, he's going to have a lot on his plate with his other job.  Sure.  Let's see.  Who else is there?  How great would it be to have enough time to go do another job?  Oh, my God.  I would love that.  Imagine that.  And then you got Eminem, who doesn't even do radio here.  He's on the poster wall.  That's Marshall Mathers.  That's right.  Then you got the Mad Dog.  So, you know, just following their logic, they need some kind of sports representation. 
[02:42:00]  Right.  Then you got Jay Thomas, who is so far past his prime, it's not even funny.  It's not even funny.  And he's kind of a part-timer, too, I think.  He does.  I think his show is three hours, but he does it every day.  Oh, okay.  That's part-time, three hours.  Three hours.  It's like podcasts.  It's like, you know.  And we've already done three hours.  Are we still on the air?  I'd be home.  Yeah, you need to actually do at least another half hour.  Okay.  I'd be in bed.  So he's sort of, not sort of, he's way past his prime. 
[02:42:30]  Way past.  But he's up there.  Then you got Jason Ellis.  Jason Ellis.  An up-and-comer in the biz.  How did he get one of six fucking spots?  I don't know, dude.  Look, look.  I, look.  I'm not going to badmouth him.  No.  I'll badmouth the company.  Yeah.  What the fuck?  Like, not even me.  Not even me there.  Not even Opie there.  Not Jimmy there.  It doesn't matter.  Why not someone else that works for this company there?  I'm not that far away, I feel like. 
[02:43:00]  Yeah, you got a shot here.  I feel like I'm kind of close.  And then who's that?  Mrs. Brady?  Yeah.  No, I don't know who that is.  Who's the old broad?  I've seen her around here before.  I don't even know her.  Who the fuck is Jane?  I'm in radio.  I don't even know who that is.  Who is that?  I think that's Jane Radio.  Who the fuck are you?  What's Jane Radio?  It's on an hour a day.  Oh, my God.  Are you kidding?  It's in one hour, right?  Are you kidding?  Are you kidding?  I think it's an hour.  So the company that we...  How long was she here looking at her proofs, though? 
[02:43:30]  That was weeks ago.  Fucking people.  The company that we've been counting on, believe it or not, way too long to really help our careers.  Their logic is, let's get a part-timer, a guy that doesn't even do radio, and a bra that does one hour a day up on the big poster wall.  With an up-and-comer, and a guy that's way past his prime.  The only guy that deserves a spot there is Mad Dog, believe it or not.  And all the Howard people are going to yell and scream. 
[02:44:00]  But the fact is, he's the only one actually grinding out radio shows.  And Jason, you know, he's talented, but I don't think he's to the point where he should be on the poster wall.  Hey, you know what?  In this fucking lobby, yeah, he shouldn't be on the fucking poster wall.  No, but now he's going to like...  We were with these fuck-ass companies when they were fucking just real loads of shit.  Not the shit they are now, but I mean real loads of runny fucking shit, these companies.  And we were pounding it out when there wasn't a goddamn... 
[02:44:30]  You've got to search 50 cars before you might see one of those dumb giant shark fin antennas.  And where they're broadcasting a nobody while they're building this fucking company up.  And we get fucked over?  You're pissed.  Oh, man, these motherfuckers.  You're pissed, right?  Yeah.  I'm so not going to be here in October, Sam.  Enjoy this place.  Ugh.  I am going to be a podcasting fool.  What the fuck is that about?  I can't do this anymore. 
[02:45:00]  I hope they're looking for new morning shows.  I'm not even joking.  I don't get it.  Here's the announcement.  You got a big fucking bed on the line and you got this too.  No, I'm not going to be here in October.  Oh, shit.  I can almost count on it at this point.  Me and Mars need this right now.  But I'm not going because people like, wow, could you tell me if you're going to be here  past October because I need to renew and stuff?  No, I'm not going to be here.  See what the poster thing did?  Because it's so stupid.  This is saying this says so much.  And this is what they've been telling us since we've been here.  They don't give a fuck about us. 
[02:45:30]  So just mad dog.  Who's Jane Radio?  Who is Jane Radio?  I don't want to work for a company where they think Jane Radio is more important than  us.  Who's Jane Radio?  Someone with a poster.  Who the fuck is she?  I don't know.  Iraq, you know a lot about...  I'm looking.  I can't see her.  You gossip queen?  I'm not seeing her on some of these child records.  Who the fuck is Jane Radio?  And why did she look at a big poster wall?  She looked at a proof and had a poster put up. 
[02:46:00]  You can't even find her?  Yeah, the lady who I thought that was isn't her.  Go down the hall, Sam, and ask that fuck why Jane Radio is on the poster wall.  I don't think it's Jane Radio.  Is it in rotation?  Who is it?  I have no clue.  I've seen the lady around here.  I know she definitely works here.  It's not even Jane Radio.  Does she clean up?  Who is she?  Is she on the air?  Should I go ask who she is?  Yeah, but say, who is that?  But address them as, hey, fuck.  I'm not going to say that.  I'm sure you heard it, though.  The guys want to know who Jane Radio is. 
[02:46:30]  No, I'm going to ask them who the blonde on the poster is.  It's not Jane Radio.  All right, then who's the blonde?  Okay, I'll go find out.  Does anyone know who it is?  No.  Who is it?  I don't know.  Who is it?  Is it someone's mother?  I have no idea.  Sam's running like a girl.  While Sam's doing that, I might as well just say, you know, if you put Life on the Compound  and iTunes, you'll get a podcast from last night where I watched Intervention.  Oh, nice.  And commented on the gay gentleman that was being intervened. 
[02:47:00]  Very good.  It's fun.  Yeah.  And it's from my house.  And I have a poster of me up there.  Yeah.  Actually, I don't.  I'm looking at proofs tomorrow at my house.  It's going to be very fun to see what's next when October hits because you can't be part  of this.  Uh-huh.  You really can't.  At this point, you really can't be part of this.  It's just getting silly.  Because there's life after this place and it's going to be time to just start that new  life.  It's like they're goofing on us. 
[02:47:30]  It's ridiculous.  It really is like they're doing some of this stuff on purpose and going like, can you fucking  do it?  They are going to shit when we don't put a poster of them up.  Let's just watch them shit.  You know when you goof on people?  Yeah.  That's what they're doing with us.  And I know they probably don't even give a fuck if we do leave.  So whatever.  May I say something?  We'll do some good radio to the end of the contract and then we'll see what's next.  Yes, Kenny?  Yes.  There's rumblings in the hallway that they're going to remodel this floor.  So I'm sure there's plans to get you a bigger and better studio. 
[02:48:00]  Into what?  A textile factory?  Well.  Not a radio station.  This was supposed to be a temporary studio, but we gave up on that a long time ago.  Sam, why are you laughing?  I don't know who it is.  Oh, God.  Oh, who is it?  Is it worse than Jane Radio, first of all?  It might be, yeah.  What's Jane Radio for the people out there?  Because I don't even know.  Jane Radio is the lady who...  Do they just play songs that have the word Jane in it?  Jane?  Jane's Addiction?  They do a lifestyle talk show. 
[02:48:30]  Jane, what?  She's a media pioneer who founded iconic magazine Sassy Jane and now XOJane.com.  What?  Why are you breathing heavy?  What the fuck does that mean?  You're 20 years younger than me, you fucking loser.  Because they had to run to the posters.  She put out a couple of magazines.  All right.  But that's not...  It doesn't matter because Jane Radio is not on the poster wall.  Jane Radio does not have a poster.  That woman is Pia Lindstrom from Book Radio. 
[02:49:00]  Pia Lindstrom used to be on the news here, I think, in New York City.  She was on, like, Action News.  Wait.  They put someone on the poster wall that just reads books every day?  It's from Book Radio.  She just reads books.  Wait, wait.  Book Radio.  Book Radio.  That doesn't even make sense.  It's either a book or it's radio.  What the fuck?  And they put her fucking poster up?  They gave a poster to a Kindle broad. 
[02:49:30]  Book Radio.  It's a book.  What are you talking about?  She doesn't even have to make anything up on the fly.  She's reading a book.  How easy is that gig?  Oh, man.  And they put her face up there?  Is that who's up there?  Yeah.  Book Radio poster lady.  What does she do on Book Radio?  It looks like she does...  Yeah.  If you were doing a show on Book Radio, all you have to do is bring a book in.  Bring a book. 
[02:50:00]  There's my show prep.  Today we're going to do Chapters 5 and 6.  Yeah.  What do you want to do after the break?  Chapter 7.  She also interviews authors on Monday nights, Wednesday afternoons, Friday nights, and Sunday  afternoons.  Poster.  October can't come fast enough.  An exclusive weekly interview show.  Oh, fuck.  Hosted by the veteran movie and theater critic P.L. Lindstrom.  Holy fuck.  She saw her proof. 
[02:50:30]  Transposure to the insiders of the publishing world.  How we wouldn't have been up there.  First thing.  Look.  If they're going to book radio lady.  Look.  We should have been up there first fucking thing.  Look.  I'm going to be...  I'm going to be honest with you.  Howard, obviously.  Sure.  Mm-hmm.  As much as we, you know, joke.  Right.  Fine.  Part-time and all he's still like.  Sure.  Important to the company.  We should be up there before Eminem.  Because he doesn't even work here.  Doesn't work here.  You know, you could say he's a big star, which he is. 
[02:51:00]  But he doesn't work here.  But he doesn't work here.  Put a poster up in the bathroom or something.  Look.  Eminem.  Yeah.  Mad dog.  Yeah.  He's pumping some shows out.  And it's a sports angle.  That's a sports angle.  Jay Thomas is a fucking has-been.  For real.  Jay Thomas is...  No one has given a fuck about him since you had to write 19 on your checks.  Wow.  It was in 1999.  It was like 15 years ago almost.  That's crazy.  No one gives a fuck about him.  No.  He thinks he's a big deal.  He's not.  Murphy Brown.  He's not even close to a big fucking deal.  It's true. 
[02:51:30]  Cheers.  Jason Ellis is an up-and-comer that's going to have a long career in radio.  But not yet.  But just not yet.  Not there yet.  There's six spots.  Not poster worthy when there's six spots.  And then there's a book lady.  Book.  Book lady.  And they wonder why we bitch a lot.  Book lady.  They wonder why we bitch.  Are you fucking kidding me?  You have a problem with two-thirds of the posters.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  The only one I would go with is Howard and Mad Dog.  Seriously.  That's all I would go with.  So who would you put up there to represent book radio? 
[02:52:00]  No one.  Book radio.  I can't believe.  You know, we couldn't have made up a more obscure nothing station than the reality, which is book radio.  How many people listen to book radio?  Give me the numbers right the fuck now.  Stop hiding these stupid numbers.  I know we do well for the company.  Oh, big.  And I'm sure we have more people coming in than book radio.  Been with this company seven years. 
[02:52:30]  Been in this building just about three years.  Because I never even knew there was a book radio.  I've had Sirius and XM satellite radios in numerous vehicles.  I've never come across book radio.  You know, I love radio.  I heart radio.  Yes.  Oh.  Get the I heart radio people on the phone.  No, no, no.  I think we can work something out.  You don't want to do that.  Why?  Why?  Why not?  Book radio.  I just, just, I really got happy when I ran to the lobby and I saw the little logo in  the corner said book radio. 
[02:53:00]  Oh, you must have just been ecstatic.  Like it, it didn't get that good.  Yeah.  No way.  Sway.  You can put Sway out there.  Sway would work.  He comes in every morning.  No.  He comes in and works.  Sway is being represented by Eminem because they have to put everyone in categories too.  So they overthink everything.  Okay.  We got Howard.  We got, okay.  Music.  All right.  Eminem.  Sports Mad Dog.  Has been Jay Thomas.  I don't think they said that.  Up and comer young demo. 
[02:53:30]  No, they're just thinking, yeah.  Extreme young radio.  And then for the dried up vaginas.  Yes.  For old hunt rags.  And I'm not saying that about her because now I got to go do human resources.  No.  Not her.  I don't do human resources.  You mean about the average book radio listener?  Yeah.  Yeah.  That is the biggest insult ever.  Out of all the insults this place has thrown at us.  Book radio is?  We used to be somebody.  We're not even.  We used to be somebody and we're not even close to has been like Jay. 
[02:54:00]  At least we still got a little juice.  There's still a quality control on this program.  Do you think people like fucking text shit and send messages like, dude, when you were  reading like page 603 of Taylor Two Cities, I couldn't get out of my car.  I sat in my fucking driveway.  I couldn't get out of my car.  Holy shit.  Book radio.  This is such an insult.  Which book do you think would make the best radio show? 
[02:54:30]  Well, actually.  I thought the biggest insult was that we don't have a poster until like, you know, Gary heard  us talking in the urinal.  Well, yeah.  And then how to scramble.  Scramble.  Then come up with this idea that they might be rotating posters.  And if they're rotating, book radio shouldn't be in the fucking rotation until like 20 years  from now.  And if she is in the rotation, I don't want to be in the rotation.  I'm not going to be rotating with some bra that reads books on the radio. 
[02:55:00]  Hence book radio.  Book radio.  Wow.  Do they do twofers?  Two books?  Two books.  They're twofers.  Two Stephen King novels?  Two for Tuesday.  That's Ingrid Bergman's daughter?  Give us a fuck.  I'm the son of Fred Hughes.  That's right.  Yeah.  Entrepreneur extraordinaire.  Oh, my God.  At least we've been doing radio.  Huh?  At least we've been doing radio.  Are you sure?  For years, I think.  Right?  Haven't we been doing radio? 
[02:55:30]  17 years.  Book radio.  And still no respect.  Oh, that's good.  Pat Ramanaki.  Book radio is bound to fail.  That's pretty funny.  17 years.  They just discuss books.  You do realize they close down all the bookstores.  No one cares about books anymore.  Exactly.  That's another thing.  No one fucking buys books.  Oh, you read.  Sure.  But, you know, you read your electronic books.  Sure.  A few people have the e-reader or whatever. 
[02:56:00]  But in general, no one gives a fuck about books anymore.  Or there would be bookstores.  Yeah.  If you were going to get a book on tape, you'd probably like to pick the book, not just have  some random book halfway through on the radio.  Reading it on the radio.  Yeah.  Oh, I love this part.  Have you heard this chapter before?  It's great.  Wow.  Whatever.  Man.  Oh, man.  Oh, man.  There's nothing they can say that excuses this.  There's nothing they can say where I would go, oh.  Oh, that makes sense.  Well, that's why you got book radio lady on. 
[02:56:30]  Oh, okay.  See, I thought it was odd that we weren't up there being with this company for seven years.  And a book reader was on the posters.  One of six.  How many channels here at SiriusXM Satellite Radio?  Oh, hundreds.  What?  Six spots on the wall.  Six.  I know of four channels.  Tops.  No, there's well over two to three hundred channels.  All Nation, Pearl Jam Radio, ONA, Classic Rewind. 
[02:57:00]  Is that four?  I'd rather have seen Cousin Brucie right there.  He used to be there, and then he got rotated out for book radio.  See what happens?  I like wig radio.  Is that a wig?  Come on.  I like the way the posters are designed.  It's almost like, not quite, you'd have to flip one or two, but they're almost in order  of how pissed off you guys would be, with like book radio being the most pissed off.  You're right.  It's like Howard's first, and of course, why not? 
[02:57:30]  And then you go to Eminem, who's a huge star.  Everyone knows his name, so whatever.  Then you got Mad Dog.  He works hard.  We like him.  We've been doing it for a long time.  Now we start getting a little annoyed.  Yes.  Jay Thomas.  No, I would have to switch Jason and Jay, as far as annoyance goes.  Really?  Yeah, I'm not annoyed by Jason.  He's an open comer.  He's not ready for the poster wall. 
[02:58:00]  Don't give a shit.  I think Jay Thomas belongs there before Jason.  No, aren't you most annoyed at book lady?  That's why she's at the end.  So then Jay should be second to the end.  No, no, no.  You're more annoyed at the Jason thing?  I'm more annoyed at Jason than I am at the Jay Thomas.  Jay Thomas has at least put his fucking years in.  Jesus.  This guy's like, you're missing the point.  You don't need promotion.  Oh, really?  Maybe you should have been walking around the Borgata this weekend.  Really?  Ah, shit.  That's funny.  Yeah. 
[02:58:30]  Whatever.  Whatever.  God.  Book radio.  Do you listen?  We fucking sit here until 10 o'clock every day and there's something called book radio  on this platform?  I know why.  And they give us, they say anything about our show or our fucking work ethic or anything.  You have book radio.  This is...  Oh, my God.  This is that, uh...  I forgot his name even.  Uh, uh...  Bob Richards. 
[02:59:00]  Bob...  No, uh...  Who's the guy?  Who?  The ghoul.  Oh, oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Bob, um...  Edwards.  No.  Edwards.  Yeah, Bob Edwards.  This is Bob Edwards all over again.  Yeah.  Yeah, remember Bob Edwards?  First got Texem.  They were way more excited that they signed Bob Edwards than Opian Anthony.  They were drooling.  I mean, way more excited.  It wasn't even close.  Drooling to sign us just so we can, like, shut us up and not have to talk to Bob anymore,  Bob, our agent, anymore.  And then we, like, signed. 
[02:59:30]  And right after we signed, they're like, by the way.  Yeah.  Guess who else is on board?  We want to tell you guys.  We're like, holy fuck, here comes a huge name.  Right.  Bob Edwards.  What?  Is he on book radio?  I don't even know if he's still on radio.  I have no idea.  I don't know if he's still alive.  I have no idea.  I have no idea.  You guys are going to get upset.  I have more.  Yeah, never mind.  You'll get upset.  Oh, no.  What did you find, Sam?  No, don't even worry about it.  Just move on to it because you'll be upset.  No, I don't care.  I am upset already.  You can get more upset. 
[03:00:00]  What did you find?  I see something.  I see a book radio logo in something that you're going to read.  Because you're going to be upset.  I don't know.  Maybe move on to the next thing.  Don't even worry about it.  Oh, my God.  Is this a video?  No.  Oh, shit.  Can I say something?  Because Jimmy has put this thought in a lot of listeners' brains.  AIDS?  AIDS, sure.  And I just want to say I don't agree with that.  I mean, we don't agree with each other on this show all the time.  Oh, my God.  This guy writes, and he's heard it because Jimmy has said it.  You think maybe Howard has in his enormous contract that you guys can't appear in any marketing campaign with which he or his image is affiliated. 
[03:00:30]  Nah.  I don't believe that is true.  Jimmy, if you sat down with him, swears that's true.  It's on Fox News, though.  The two logos and that commercial that always runs.  Yeah, he swears it's true, and I just don't believe it.  I mean, that's letting these idiots off the hook.  I don't believe it.  The fact is they don't think much about this show in the end.  I just need to tell you something about P.L. Lindstrom's show.  What?  Who is she again?  She's the one with the poster in the lobby on Book Radio. 
[03:01:00]  Book Radio lady.  Is she the star of Book Radio?  No.  Because she does the interviews and stuff.  Yeah.  Dude, if you say that she does like an hour every four months, I'm going to fucking.  No, she's on a couple times a week.  Oh.  The show's 30 minutes.  And these fucking guys bitch if we take a day off.  A 30 minute show?  We do four hours a day.  How often? 
[03:01:30]  It's on four times a week, and that includes replays.  Oh.  So she might tape this shit.  There's like maybe two.  A week.  30 minutes.  Seriously, why is she on the wall?  Go ask that idiot down the hall why she's on the wall.  I want that taken down.  I want his answer.  Immediately.  You want her off the wall.  I want her off the wall.  I'm going to spray paint that shit on the way out.  If you've got an extra half hour, you can listen to her show. 
[03:02:00]  Wait.  Is there a sampling up there?  What is that?  What is that?  What is that?  This is Charlene Harris on why I created True Blood Sookie on Sirius XM.  What is that?  Book Radio?  Yeah, it's Book Radio.  Can we tune in Book Radio right now?  Can we tune it in?  Mars, can we get Book Radio?  Does someone have an app?  Oh, Jesus.  That would be the best way.  Instead of like...  Let me get into the app. 
[03:02:30]  All right.  Yeah.  Get us some Book Radio, please.  Does everybody want to do some espresso first?  So we don't all just fucking pass out?  Book Radio.  Yeah.  Channel 80?  Channel 80.  I thought it was 80 on 8.  What?  No.  Is this it?  No.  Oh, 80's on 8.  Not an 80.  Yeah.  We all know 80's on 8 is now on 25.  I have no idea.  Remember when they did the channel change?  Oh, my God.  Yeah.  What a clusterfuck. 
[03:03:00]  They didn't even go in logic with that.  You got it?  Sam.  I'm trying to figure out what category it's in.  What category is Book Radio in?  Oh, Ambien.  It's in the narcotic category.  The audio narcotics.  You know everyone is laughing at us, Sam.  Yes.  Because you guys don't have a poster, but Book Radio does?  I just turned off my Twitter.  They're just openly mocking and laughing at us now.  I am stunned.  Found it.  But it says a lot, Ant.  Oh, it speaks volumes, if I may say.  Volumes, huh? 
[03:03:30]  Volumes.  A little vernacular of Book Radio.  Quentin always pictured him awkwardly pushing.  Are they reading a book right now?  Oh, my God.  Like a uvula of a monstrous throat.  It's like he's opening the covers of a book, but a book that did what?  Books always promised to do and never actually quite did.  Thank God James is not here.  He loses his mind.  Really out of where you were and into somewhere better.  Poster.  Poster.  What Martin discovers in the walls of his aunt's house is a world of magical twilight, a landscape 
[03:04:00]  as black and white and stark as a printed page with prickly stubble fields and rolling  hills.  Honestly, honestly, is anyone except us listening to that?  They have the option to because the app works.  Holy shit, Sam.  You are a fucking cock.  Holy shit.  Are you saying that our app wasn't working for three days and no one noticed?  But Book Radio's app. 
[03:04:30]  And not one phone call was made or anything.  Right there.  I don't know.  That's not what I was implying.  I, I, I, I.  Wow.  Did you like the book?  What book was it?  I don't know.  Did they at least tell you what book they're reading on the pen data?  Like a giant juvula.  Juvula.  The Magicians.  By Lev Grossman.  Oh, Lev.  I am Lev.  For a hundred years.  Bare trees scratch at the sky. 
[03:05:00]  Pale green seas lap at narrow white...  Whatever, dude.  But that way when we have guests up or whatever and they're waiting in the lobby, they're like,  oh, I got Book Radio.  Hey, I'm a big fan.  You think the Book Radio people, when they're walking out of the building, there's people  standing there just going, excuse me, could you sign this book?  It's always a book.  It's never theirs.  I'm not, I'm not pompous to think that, you know, when we leave in October, or certainly  I will be leaving in October.  Maybe not.  That this place is going to crash.  Oh, no, I, I don't see this place crumbling to the ground. 
[03:05:30]  And maybe, maybe they will, we'll both be fine, I guess.  Because I, I can't, I can't, I can't be at a company...  Can't compete with Book Radio?  ...that thinks Book Radio is important enough.  Fight a good fight.  They have to display them in the lobby.  Don't buckle to the pressures of Book Radio.  That's true.  You can beat this channel.  No.  We don't have to beat Book Radio.  I know it.  In order to be successful.  Yes.  There's room for both of you.  No, my career goes on after this, and it's time to start it.  Like, we can't fight these battles anymore.  Don't say that. 
[03:06:00]  It's tiring to the listener, and it's tiring to us, because no one listens to us.  Yeah, but the listeners, they want to hear you on SiriusXM badly.  Ah, they'll find us.  It's a lot easier to find us these days.  What was that book that...  A couple years ago, I would have been nervous.  Jimmy used to have?  Not anymore.  Something Boys?  Oh, Rent Boys.  Yeah.  Rent Boys.  We should do Book Radio Rent Boys.  We turn...  You want to compete with Book Radio and take them out?  You know, we can't ever compete with them.  Let's take them out.  We haven't had a good radio war in a while.  A good radio war with Book Radio. 
[03:06:30]  Let's take on Book Radio.  Yeah, fucking pages suck.  Yeah, that cover thing.  You know, you can't tell a book by its cover.  Ah!  That's the book humor.  Yeah, Book Radio, more like Cliff Notes Radio.  Oh, shit!  Oh, shit!  We also have to figure out how we get out of our interview with Rolling Stone Magazine today.  What?  No, you don't.  Home is so good. 
[03:07:00]  Yeah, we're tired, Sam.  The idea of home is great.  We did four individual podcasts today.  This would be a month of podcasting.  First of all, radio is better than podcasting.  I don't think so anymore.  And second of all...  Actually, we did eight P.L. Lindstrom shows.  We did.  Put it that way.  Fuck the podcast.  How many M&M shows did we do today?  Oh, shit.  Infinity.  Yeah.  How much radio has he done in the last year?  Be honest.  None.  Zero this year.  None radio.  2012.  Zero.  How much in 2011?  20 minutes?  Safe to say? 
[03:07:30]  Give him an hour.  Why don't you give him an hour?  Why don't you be a sport?  An hour of radio for the entire year.  Yeah.  For the year.  Not counting...  You can't count when they play music.  That means alone...  Today alone, we've done four years of M&M radio.  You do realize that?  Four years.  We talked more today than M&M will talk on SiriusXM for the next four years.  Do you understand why I'm going insane?  Yeah.  But, you know, it's a different deal.  That means in one lousy week of Opie and Anthony, we've done 20 years of M&M radio. 
[03:08:00]  20 years.  That's longer than me and Anne have been together doing radio.  In one week.  You starting the next level of your career or whatever you're planning on doing, it's not  going to help trying to get out of Rolling Stone interviews.  You still got to promote yourself.  Well, they set up this interview, but I'm tired.  How do we get out of the Rolling Stone interview?  You don't.  You do the Rolling Stone interview.  Like, you should...  Of course, you should...  How about you and E-Rock?  It's Rolling Stone.  How about you and E-Rock do it?  Okay.  Franchise. 
[03:08:30]  Franchise it out.  But you got to be us.  You guys know enough about the show.  You got to be us.  Who do I get to be?  Anthony again?  Yeah, be me.  Okay.  Just go like, woo-hoo.  And then go, yay, yay.  And then go like, hey, Jacob.  Right.  And then they'll be like, when did you start?  And I'll be like, well, that's my Reagan.  That's a great Reagan.  It's like the real person.  Rolling Stone.  And this is supposed to be like an hour?  They'll be like, what do you think of the company?  I'll be like, yeah, yeah, you jerk.  That's good. 
[03:09:00]  That's Imas.  That's good.  You're in, man.  Okay.  Tell Rolling Stone we'll give him 10 minutes.  No, you give Rolling Stone as much as Rolling Stone wants.  I can give him 10 minutes today.  Give him as much as I want.  What else are you doing?  We've done all this before.  I want to go home.  It gets you nowhere.  I just want to go home.  We've been in Rolling Stone before.  It's no big deal at this point.  You need to get back in Rolling Stone.  Nah, I don't.  Yes, you do.  You need to get on the wall in the lobby.  Fuck it.  I'd rather get in.  I'd rather.  Who's on the cover?  Book lady?  Fuck.  I'm at the cover.  The cover is the biggest piece of shit going. 
[03:09:30]  Why do you say that?  Because he just walked by.  He does stuff that, unless I bring it to everyone's attention, it goes unnoticed.  Yeah.  He just walked by the window with a book in his hand and just mocking us.  Yeah, yeah.  And laughing.  He had to go find a book.  And he's got.  Doesn't come in here.  He just walks by the window with a book.  Yeah.  The key is getting your names out there.  If you really want to do this, you have to do interviews with people like Rolling Stone.  It's giant publications.  We've done it.  In the lobby.  Yeah, but you've got to do it again.  We've done it.  I'm not talking to them for an hour.  At least be like, how could you, you could say, look, we're in Rolling Stone this month 
[03:10:00]  and we're not in the lobby.  Wouldn't that be a nice argument to have?  No, because none of that matters to these guys.  You do all, even that, they don't give a fuck.  They really don't seem to care about anything.  Because they listen to book radio?  No, they got Howard.  They can't have book radio.  They're Howard and Books.  Their business model is Howard.  I don't run the company.  If you want to run the company that way, God bless you.  But the reality is that means there's no room for anybody else.  There's no room for anyone else to shine here.  You've got the chance to create a demand through vehicles like Rolling Stone magazine. 
[03:10:30]  You see that movie, Almost Famous, right?  That's a big magazine.  Oh, this isn't good.  What?  I just saw somebody post a link to Facebook's book radio Facebook page.  No, don't do it.  Yeah, yeah.  Somebody just posted the link here on Talton.  That's really bad.  For them.  Not for us.  Yeah, that can't.  What's that?  Security's been kind of hanging around.  Oh, really?  That's never a good sign, but whatever. 
[03:11:00]  Jeopardy, did you watch?  No, but I heard.  I read the tweets.  Punch for 800, please.  A blow to the back of the neck is the punch named for this animal.  Mike.  What is a donkey?  No.  Fancy.  What is a rabbit punch?  Rabbit, yes.  Punch for 600, please.  Is Alex laughing?  Oh, yeah.  He knows what a donkey punch is.  Because Alex knows what a donkey punch is?  Yeah.  He's a dirty boy.  Which one is the donkey punch?  I get confused by all these.  This Sanchez is known by his smelly mustache. 
[03:11:30]  Dirty?  What is dirty?  Who is dirty?  Who is dirty?  But what is the donkey punch?  Do you know?  Which one is it, though?  I mean, I know it's one of those.  I know it's one where you kick him in the side.  Is it to pull your hair?  Yeah.  And then punch him in the side of the face?  Punch back ahead, tightens the asshole.  Donkey punch.  They have a drawing.  They have a sketch.  You punch her in the back of the neck while you're buried balls deep in her asshole.  So the guy was right.  Alex had a punch in the back of the neck. 
[03:12:00]  Yeah.  Yeah, but that's the sexual one.  The other one is a rabbit punch, is it?  Rabbit punch.  I think that's what the answer he was looking for, right?  Is that what they said?  Yes.  Oh, that's a good point.  Steven asks for Bayshore.  You guys got to do the interview with Rolling Stone Magazine.  Maybe they'll read it on magazine radio.  Ah!  That's true.  You got to get a little closer to the book radio demo.  And being in print is part of it.  This is an unhappy buccaneer. 
[03:12:30]  Uh, what is Angry Pirate, Alex?  Yes.  Answer.  How could you not want to do an interview with Rolling Stone?  What?  Huh?  How could you not want to do an interview with Rolling Stone?  We've been in it already.  Yeah, but you'd like...  You'd be in it again.  It's Rolling Stone.  What does it do for you?  Publicity.  And then what happens?  Get your name out there.  That means I'll be recognized next time I'll walk around the Bregada?  No, it makes people aware of you, but that's bugging you, isn't it?  What?  Oh, there's been a bit of a drop-off.  Maybe it's the beard. 
[03:13:00]  Blame it on the beard.  Oh, boy.  No.  There's been a drop-off.  Dizzy Gillespie needs oil.  Uh, what is the rusty trombone?  Oh, wait a minute.  It's trumpet.  Yeah, I don't know.  Who plays the trombone?  Nobody.  Duke Ellington?  No.  Kenny?  Rolling Stone is ready for you.  Well, tell him we're going to be a few minutes late.  Well, the sooner you do it, the sooner we go home.  What do you have that attitude for?  It's an interview with Rolling Stone magazine.  It's a great, it's a big thing. 
[03:13:30]  Where are they?  This would make fog in Ohio.  What is a Cleveland steamer?  Alex?  Yes.  For a daily double.  The interview will take place in Studio B.  What?  So if we go down this hall, we're good?  No, don't go down.  Just go to the studio and do the interview.  No, that means that's the quickest way to the elevators today.  We've got to go down that hall.  Yeah, we've got to escape.  You've got to get your names out there.  Okay?  Take some personal responsibility for your not getting recognized, the Borgata, if it's that important. 
[03:14:00]  I'm going to request that they do not mention Sirius or XM in this interview.  Why?  It's where you're on.  Or I don't do it.  But that's where people can hear you.  Why give them promotion if they don't give us promotion?  Mr. Sagan needs the air conditioner.  What is a hot, Carl?  Yes.  For 10,000.  You have to mention Sirius XM because otherwise people won't know where to hear you. 
[03:14:30]  They've got to hear you.  They're hearing us.  You just said shit.  I hear you.  You just said there's been a drop-off.  Well, it's been a drop-off, but there's still ears out there.  So what are you going to plug?  Some people that got their ears on.  OB Radio, YouTube, and then their ears on.  CV Talk.  What?  You going to plug YouTube and iTunes?  Oh, boy.  They are deleting pics as fast as they can go up on Facebook.  Oh, God.  I didn't know they would be posting pictures.  We never said it, by the way, so don't give a shit about it.  The problem is not.  We're not soliciting that.  Book radio in and of itself is not the problem here. 
[03:15:00]  Yeah.  They're a great channel.  No.  Okay.  Maybe I won't go that far then.  I'll go far.  Hey, look at that.  What happened?  Well.  What happened?  We were just talking about him.  Who?  Well, he seems to have a new tattoo show.  Oh.  Who?  Oh, Navarro?  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, we passed on him.  Why did you say that?  I have no problem telling our listeners.  He just peeked in the window and gave a little wave.  Why did you say that you passed on him just now? 
[03:15:30]  I don't know.  But why did I just not say it?  Why did you say that?  He just poked his finger in as if to say hi.  And you said hi.  Yeah.  He was hoping we'd go like this and come on in for a minute.  Oh, boy.  But, nah, just keep, you know, hi.  Oh.  Oh.  It's 10 o'clock.  You guys are in a bad mood now.  We're not in a bad mood.  Under Caesar, they wore these into battle.  Alex, what is a Roman war helmet?  Answer.  If I felt like I had nothing else, you know, going on, I'd be in a bad mood. 
[03:16:00]  So what are you going to plug in the Rolling Stone interview then?  Just like my videos.  Why don't you plug the show?  Because then that means they get a plug.  Yeah, but you also get a plug.  I don't want to plug them.  You don't want new subscribers.  If they can't figure out that maybe we deserve a poster in the lobby, I don't want to promote them.  Why don't you say something like, we're not terribly happy with the company, but we're glad to be broadcasting on SiriusXM because we reach X number of people. 
[03:16:30]  It's what Mr. Lipton does to Mrs. Lipton.  What is teabagging, Alex?  Yes.  Correct.  You're in the lead.  As Ant tries to think of a new one.  I hope people are catching that.  I mean, you could be honest.  I'm playing my part perfectly.  What?  You could be honest.  About what?  Your feelings about the company.  Nah, even that.  But plug the company.  Even that, I don't feel like doing it anymore. 
[03:17:00]  Yeah.  Now this idiot's waiting for us outside the studio.  I'm not talking to you.  Yeah, he's right out there.  I'm not talking to you.  Oh, God.  With your dumb explanation of why the book lady's on a poster wall and we're not.  But you're just doing this for the air.  There's nothing you can say, you idiot.  Oh, Jesus.  That's harsh.  Put your head back in your turtle shell.  Oh, wow.  Oh, my God.  That is goddamn hard.  You're not talking to that guy, are you? 
[03:17:30]  I don't even see him.  What can he possibly say about book radio?  Book radio.  Maybe he's got other things to talk about.  Maybe he just wants to show you the proof.  Can I go get the proof from him for the poster?  Do they do like a...  God, I wish we had a book around.  I haven't seen a book in years.  Yeah, in this studio?  Stop it.  It's probably just pages turning.  Book radio. 
[03:18:00]  Yeah.  Who needs a book?  You can listen on the radio.  That's true.  Books are obsolete.  What if they read a book you don't care about?  Then you've got a long drive ahead of you, my friend.  And then you've got to wait for them to finally pick your book?  That's the dumbest concept ever.  Really doesn't make sense.  Why would you do that?  At least when you listen to rock radio, you're like, well, I think eventually they'll get  to Immigrant Sorrow by Zeppelin.  Or it's like, oh, I'll wait around because I think there's a chance.  With book radio, they go, oh, today we're going to start Stephen King's, what's his latest?  It's 1963 or whatever? 
[03:18:30]  Or about The Stand.  Yeah, The Stand.  It's like forever.  Then you know you won't even have a chance that your book's being read for at least a  month.  You're invested.  Or on music radio, you could be like, oh, I haven't heard this in a while.  I'd love to hear it.  Like, that never comes up with a full audio book.  Do you think they go deep cuts?  I'd like to sit here for the next nine hours.  Do you think they do deep cuts in books?  Oh, gosh.  Rare books?  Yeah.  We're going to go a little deep this weekend.  Going in the vault for some rare books.  Rare books.  Yeah. 
[03:19:00]  Do you want to see the proof?  No.  I don't even want to be on the wall anymore.  You don't want to be on the wall anymore.  Who wants to be on the wall with fucking book lady?  What if you make, what if you insist that she get rotated out for your spot?  You mean, you mean insist on something?  Yes.  Which we've done a million times and nothing changes?  Oh.  As in, I insist that you make the lights better in this studio?  Ah.  Do you want me to turn them on?  No.  That's just going to get us mad.  This is us not mad. 
[03:19:30]  Oh.  Are you sure?  I mean.  Did you do Pittsburgh Platter yet?  Uh, Cleveland Steamer.  Yeah.  Pretty much the same thing.  The guy's trying to get in on it.  Yeah.  Yeah.  There has to be something we can do to put you guys in a good place with the company  before your Rolling Stone interview.  Oh.  If you cancel the Rolling Stone interview, I'll be in a great mood.  I'm not going to...  No.  I would be in a bad mood if you didn't do the Rolling Stone interview.  It makes no sense for this show for you not to do it.  Is she from Rolling Stone?  What?  Who?  Who's that?  She looks Rolling Stone-ish. 
[03:20:00]  She looks, uh, book-read.  Very book-read.  Or book-listened.  Oh, yeah.  Book-listened.  She's got big owl glasses.  She must read a lot.  Maybe she's here for her show.  Half hour.  It's a half hour show?  Or nine hours, depending.  If it's a book, it's going to be like nine hours.  But if it's one of the...  What's her name?  The poster lady there, right?  Yeah, P.L. Lindstrom.  How much radio does she do a week?  I would say...  One, two, three, four...  120 minutes. 
[03:20:30]  Is this true they just hired Marley Maitland to do deaf radio?  Is she going to post her?  It's deaf radio.  It's radio for the deaf.  Right.  No, not even that.  Oh.  It's just silence.  Oh, that's it.  Because they can't hear.  It's braille radio.  Roland.  You're five minutes late for your interview.  We're not doing our interview.  Yes, you are doing the interview.  It's Rolling Stone.  They're fleeing the interview.  They're fleeing the interview.  Fleeing the interview.  Suspect fleeing the interview.  Fleeing the interview.  You're supposed to be put up right now. 
[03:21:00]  One.  What?  There it is.  It's escalated.  It's escalated.  You heard me?  Yep.  Okay.  Yeah.  Really, Roland?  You didn't get him, Roland.  How's your voice?  I saw so.  What the fuck is wrong with you?  I have no idea.  I used to book for a radio show, and I enjoyed swimming, but I'm not going to do neither.  Sore throat radio.  I know this doesn't hurt either, but just crack them.  Yeah.  Oh, it's okay.  My voice is okay. 
[03:21:30]  Now he's like, oh, he's like Lucille Ball.  Oh, freaky.  Someone's saying, someone's saying, you know what?  This is worth taking.  We didn't take many calls today, but trucker, trucking Chuck, go ahead, sir.  You know, they don't even read the whole book.  This guy knows?  A couple chapters, then you've got to wait like about a week to get the rest of the book.  What?  Yeah.  They don't even read the whole book.  That's stupid.  Because the only people that would listen are truckers who have long roads ahead of them,  and they're probably like, oh, good.  Partly a channel for us where I've got eight hours to kill. 
[03:22:00]  I'll listen to them read a book.  It's like books on tape.  Let my mind wander a little bit.  But they're doing it like music, like an album where, oh, shit, oh, my God, I want to fucking kill him.  He's a trucker.  This doesn't happen on book radio.  You know that we give some of the truckers a little leeway.  Yeah, silly me trying to go with an analogy.  But they're lonely.  We give a little leeway.  Yeah.  They don't get to talk to many people.  Maybe if you wouldn't kill all the hookers.  All right, you can talk to them.  Every so often talk to a hooker instead of murdering her. 
[03:22:30]  Fuck, shut up.  Holy shit.  Don't bring this energy in with you to the Rolling Stone interview.  We're not doing it.  Yes, you are doing it.  You're bringing the energy into my Escalade.  No, you're going to do the interview, and then you're going home.  There's nothing wrong with doing it.  It's 10 o'clock in the morning.  Rolling Stone, I'll be rolling home.  Nice.  That's what I say, right?  No.  Like a Rolling Stone.  Yeah.  I'm not going to gather any moss.  Nope.  I'll receive grievances to the article.  What did you say?  What the fuck was that even? 
[03:23:00]  I believe what he said was, receive a grievances to the article.  I heard that, too.  I heard that, too.  Wow.  Yeah.  Is he still outside?  Yeah.  He doesn't get the hint.  Sure, you can talk to me.  I can't prevent you from talking to me, but watch what I do today.  He wants to show you the proof.  I've seen it.  Is it good?  At first glance, it may look like Opie's hand is on Anthony's tummy, but that's just first  glance. 
[03:23:30]  Oh, boy.  Can I see the proof then?  Not you guys.  How about just, I see it.  You guys don't have to look at it.  Look at him.  What's he doing?  What's he on the phone for out there?  He's going to scorch you to your Rolling Stone interview.  Duck and cover.  Why is he escorting us to an interview he had nothing to do with?  Oh, shit.  Why would you say that?  I don't know.  Who's this guy?  That's still Mr. Trucker guy.  Unfortunately, he hasn't hit that abutment yet.  Tell me if you think this is.  Okay, I'm going to look at the proof.  Oh, my God.  It obviously looks like your hand is on my belly. 
[03:24:00]  What?  The way it's cropped.  The way it's crapped?  Yes.  The way it's cropped is.  They're just useless.  Just useless.  Sam's laughing.  He's laughing.  All right.  Sam's coming back in.  Sam.  Am I right?  Sam coming and laughing.  Sam?  Well.  Have you seen the proofs? 
[03:24:30]  There's three of them.  Okay.  Two of them.  Who are the other two of them?  Why can't you bring the proofs in?  They're alternating our proofs.  I don't need him.  Just get the stupid proofs on that idiot.  Let's see the proofs.  He told me I couldn't have them.  Oh, my God.  Why?  What's this control thing?  You fucking hoarder.  Give us the goddamn proofs.  I can't go back out there and ask for him.  Travis has to.  Travis, could you?  Seriously.  Just tell him we want to see the proofs on the air because this stupid idiot doesn't realize 
[03:25:00]  that it's already, we made a thing about it on the radio, so now we have to play it  through.  That thing.  That guy doesn't know shit.  Well, two of the proofs are the K-Rock pictures.  What K-Rock pictures?  You remember that you guys.  What, Howard's?  No.  What K-Rock pictures?  Remember when you guys started around the K-Rock time?  I call them the K-Rock pictures.  There's like, I think, you're both wearing button-down shirts.  Oh.  I'll be wearing a black shirt.  Oh, was that the one from the, um.  From the billboard.  The billboard thing.  The billboard, all those.  Yeah, yeah, yeah. 
[03:25:30]  For the big subway stickers.  Oh, Jesus.  That's one.  The other one is the new picture that they took at the Hard Rock when you guys were doing  signings.  Yeah.  And Ant is at the front of the picture with his hand over his stomach.  Why are you describing this when they're right there?  Get the proofs.  I'll go ask for them.  Do an artist's rendering right now.  Draw it.  But Opie is standing behind Ant, so it looks like Opie's hand is wrapped around Ant.  Oh, my God.  And he's holding his chest.  And he's holding his chest. 
[03:26:00]  It's a 10-minute sleigh for your interview.  We're not doing the interview.  You are doing the interview.  Could somebody tell Rolling Stone to just wait a second?  They're going to do it, and they're excited.  How does it feel?  Why are you trying to save our careers instead of our agent, who we don't talk to anymore?  Who?  Because.  Exactly.  Oh, God.  Oh, Christ.  All right.  Take one, pass it down.  It's uncomfortable.  Oh, boy.  That proof.  Why would we use that, seriously?  Why would we use that? 
[03:26:30]  It does look like you're holding me.  Why does my hand have to be around Ant?  It looks tender and sensitive.  Who did this?  I'm not even fucking joking.  Who did this?  It does look sensitive and tender.  Why would you even show us this?  Do you want to see the original picture?  It looks like I'm holding Anthony.  This is my cock in the original.  Why?  I'm not even joking.  Why?  Why am I showing it to you?  Yeah, with my arm around Anthony, like we're gay lovers.  Yeah, I'm asking why.  I want to know if you want to use that picture and have them retouch it versus the old picture. 
[03:27:00]  How did they retouch it?  Oh, look at that.  Yeah, they got Jimmy's hand out of there.  I'm being molested by Jimmy Norton.  I hope he's got his hands on his own penis, not me.  That's your hand, but it looks like my hand.  You guys are friends.  There's nothing wrong with that.  That's just dumb.  I do look pretty buff in that one, though.  Why would you?  I'm all tan.  Why would it even be a thought?  Of course I don't want my arm around Anthony.  We don't even hug.  That can change.  We do a fist bump every once in a while.  I don't want to be holding him, like, you know, lovingly in a fucking publicity photo. 
[03:27:30]  Hey, I'm right here.  Jesus.  No, I don't mean anything like that.  I'm fucking right.  I don't believe it.  We've never touched.  Like it's an insult.  You don't want to touch me.  Not like that.  Look at that picture.  I'm holding you lovingly.  This is so fucking silly.  Because it's stupid.  That could be the tagline.  Holding you lovingly.  Why is book lady out there?  One of the six available slots. 
[03:28:00]  You know how many radio personalities work here?  Many.  Yeah.  And one of six coveted spots is a lady that does a 30-minute long show on book radio.  You couldn't pick a more obscure person from a more obscure channel, I think.  Right?  I could not agree more.  Yeah.  I bet they only talk about that Twilight Zone where fucking the guy breaks his glasses.  Henry Beavis?  Yeah.  Where he breaks his glasses. 
[03:28:30]  And like they really are upset about it.  Like, God, he had all the time in the world.  And fucking glasses broke.  Or they put it into like a production piece where he's saying like, it's not fair.  It's not fair.  And then they say, now it is fair.  Now it is.  Book radio.  You don't need glasses.  Oh.  They can redo the episode.  Look at all the books.  They'll have like when he first got to the library, he was all psyched.  It's deflecting.  Why would you show us a picture of me holding Anthony lovingly?  That picture does better reflect the intimacy that the show brings than the other pictures.  The original picture, my hand's not even. 
[03:29:00]  In a second with my fist.  The original picture, my hand's not even near Anthony.  I'm holding my own dick like Anne has pointed out.  That's why they shopped it to make it look like you guys were a little closer.  Oh, that's cool.  Someone said it could have that good queer as folk vibe.  That's right.  Yeah.  It's the gay thing.  Like it's not sports.  And everything has to be in a genre today.  It's not extreme.  These days, so we'll represent the gi.  It's not extreme Jason Ellis who I guess works here.  Why is Jason Ellis up there?  Part time.  What?  Why is Jason Ellis up there?  What?  His photo was done long ago. 
[03:29:30]  Why?  Why?  Did he look at his picture?  I asked you guys if you wanted to do a photo shoot many times.  Yes and no.  A long time ago.  The fact is he's got people that got his poster together.  We don't.  Period.  I worked on all of them at the same time.  It was me working with the people who made them.  So once we knew that you weren't going to do it, we went back through all the photos.  I said no to pictures a long time ago.  That's not an excuse.  And trust me, this process takes way too long.  And now we've got a picture where I'm holding Anthony Love.  Thank God.  Well, that way.  Well, for some reason, I guess that makes sense that it's worth showing us. 
[03:30:00]  Because one of the out-cue jocks is going to complain.  Why are my pictures on A's?  Why is it gay represented?  We threw an A up for you.  Yeah.  Opie and Anthony show sponsored by Logo.  Yes.  Channel Logo.  We got to go.  You don't have to go yet.  Hey, hey.  We got to go.  Oh.  Well, let's see.  Listen up, people.  Steven Singer.  Steven Singer and his famous gold-dipped roses are now available. 
[03:30:30]  No, they're great.  No, to Steven Singer.  No, they're great.  He loves when we beat them up.  Valentine's Day is coming up.  And why should you order now?

I just noticed that on the poster.  Was that when you touched me, your head got bigger?  Yeah.  See, this is a sexy joke.  Look at the picture.  They zoomed my head in to match yours better.  Because I'm in the background of the original picture.  Wait, wait, wait.  You're overlapping my hat brim in that one.  And in that, you're not.  So they moved you over a little.  They zoomed me in. 
[03:31:30]  To make it look more like you were holding him.  Because they wanted the loving hand to match up.  Because the loving hand was too big for my body.  So let's zoom his head in.  Then it'll match the loving hand that's around Anthony.  Photoshop guys are like, I'm going to get these own fuckers back once in a row.  Kenny, would we ever agree to a picture where I'm holding Anthony like that?  You're 15 minutes late for the interview.  I'm not doing that.  Yes, you are.

[03:32:30]  And I gather our picture will be up in the lobby at some juncture.  Absolutely.  Sooner or later.  With Book Lady.  Booked.  I didn't know there was book radio.  I never knew there was even a book radio channel.  Now you don't have to listen to the after show on the way home.  No, I know.  I finally got something else.  You know what's going to suck, though?  The Midtown Tunnel.  I'll go in page 70. 
[03:33:00]  Yeah.  I'm coming out page 72 and I'm pissed.  Oh, fuck.  Fume it.  Especially if they're good pages.  I know.  But they got to be.  But you don't have to worry because they don't finish the book anyway.  It's true.  Book radio.  They don't finish books.  Sam, what am I doing right now?  Book?  You're putting your coat on.  Yes.  I hope that's because it's chilly in the hallway on the way to your interview.  There's no way that you're going to blow off the Rolling Stone interview.  Why?  It doesn't get you anywhere.  Yes, it does.  That's what gets you places.  A little bit at a time.  Places.  You know how long we've been at this? 
[03:33:30]  Smiles, everyone.  Smiles.  Well, you know what?  You're not going to get anywhere by being a negative Nancy and saying no this, no that,  and not doing anything to help yourself.  You hang on to those big dreams.  Okay?  Listen.  I want to see where it gets you.  Listen, you could say.  Sam Roberts of the Future is going to be a fun guy.  Oh, boy.  It's some fucking shit.  I should have listened to those fucking assholes.  You could say.  They're fucking me over now.  Fuck.  Oh, the company's not helping me.  Management's not helping me.  But what are you guys doing?  Help yourselves.  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha. 
[03:34:00]  I always got book radio.  This is the OPN News Show.  Sirius XM.  Sirius XM.  Hey, hey, hey.  And now, the OPN Anthony Show continues.  This is After ONA Live.  Here's your host, Sam Roberts.  What a show.  What a show.  I didn't turn your mic on yet.  Your whole bit didn't work, Kenny. 
[03:34:30]  Oh.  What's up, buddy?  Nothing.  It was a great show, but now I'm excited to spend a few minutes with you.  Sit down.  Make yourself comfortable.  All right.  Thanks.  I guess ONA did decide to do the Rolling Stone interview.  They had no choice.  Why would they not want to do something like that?  They will.  They did.  They do the right thing.  They like being negative.  You're a guy who pays attention to how he's treated, who likes to be respected, who thinks certain people deserve certain treatment. 
[03:35:00]  You're also a guy who, working with this radio show, traveling with Jim Norton, traveling with Andrew Dice Clay, are used to making sure that celebrities are accommodated and treated as such.  Which, what did you think of the fact that Book Radio today, we found out, Book Radio has a poster out there in the lobby, but Opie and Anthony do not.  You know, Jim Norton's going to get great treatment next weekend at the Tempe Improv. 
[03:35:30]  Always a professional.  Yeah.  Yeah.  You know, Tempe Improv.com for your tickets next weekend.  Next weekend.  Not this weekend.  No, January 28th, 27th, and 28th, Friday and Saturday.  Very exciting.  Yeah.  Save money.  I'll sell you merchandise.  He can autograph it, take a picture.  It's always fun.  Yeah.  Yeah.  But what did you think of the poster?  Yeah.  And then, like, if you get bored today-  You just don't talk about things.  You could go on Facebook, Club Soda Kenny. 
[03:36:00]  All right, we got the plugs out of the way.  Check out a picture of my trench coat somebody requested.  Are we not going to be able to have a conversation?  No, I'm following your agenda.  I'm trying to talk to you about the poster.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  People could see the poster at Bananas in Poughkeepsie.  Oh, my God.  February 3 and 4.  How great.  And Norton will be there.  Ticketweb.com.  Oh, gosh.  Roland, how great did it feel to have the heat not on you today?  Well, if you live in the Atlanta, Georgia area,  Punchline Comedy Club, February 16th through the 18th. 
[03:36:30]  Norton will be there.  Punchline.com for tickets.  You know, part of being the guy who reads the plugs is making sure the audience likes you  and wants to promote whatever you're promoting.  The audience does like me.  That's why, you know, when they're in Florida,  they're going to come to the Fort Lauderdale Improv at the Hard Rock Hotel and Casino.  Nobody remembers any of these anymore.  You've done too many.  No, no, no.  February 23rd to 25.  Improvftl.com. 
[03:37:00]  So glad you stuck around.  Roland.  Listen, when I talk, people listen.  He's going to mention Caroline's next.  No, no, no.  We got Rochester first, Roland.  Don't be silly.  March 1 to 3, Thursday to Saturday, the Comedy Club.  Oh, my God.  This is awful.  Was it nice, Roland?  I bet you.  And he'll be on Brother Wheeze's radio show.  You're assuming now.  No, I said I bet you.  I didn't say I assume.  You said that because you make an ass out of me and you. 
[03:37:30]  Maybe just you.  That's what happens when you assume.  Oh, good one.  Were you happy, Roland?  Roland was ecstatic that Jimmy's going to Toledo, Ohio.  E-Rock, what do I do in this situation?  The Toledo Funny Bone Comedy Club.  What do I do?  March 8 to 10, Toledo Funny Bone Comedy.  Take control of it.  But, I mean, I don't want to disrespect Club Soda Kenny.  I don't either.  That's why I'm not saying anything.  Hey, Eric, how are you doing?  Hi, Kenny.  How are you?  All right.  I missed you this weekend.  I know.  I really wanted to go.  I know.  But, you know, it's exciting what you're doing. 
[03:38:00]  Thank you.  You know, good luck with that.  I appreciate that.  Yep.  Moving is the worst thing that one can do.  Oh, yeah.  Fucking hideous.  Yeah.  But, you know, if he wasn't moving...  Just shut up.  He can go to Caroline's on Broadway, March 29th to April 1st, which is April Fool's Day.  I should be done moving by then.  I would like to go to Caroline's.  You got it.  Free tickets for you.  Thank you, Kenny.  What about for the listeners?  Well, Big A texted me.  He wants tickets, too. 
[03:38:30]  You're giving away a few too many pairs now.  Well, Big A's a big star on the pig roast with Otto and George now.  Oh, gosh.  BigRoastTV.net or something.  Nobody remembers anything that you've said so far.  Eric, um...  Stop!  Stop talking over me!  Eric...  Was it difficult packing all your framed things?  Because you have a lot of things that you take good care of.  Yes.  There's, uh...  I had to buy special, uh...  Special-sized boxes for them.  You got to rub them... 
[03:39:00]  Wrap it all in bubble tape and then tape all that up.  And it's just a big...  Did you...  Yes.  Did you realize...  This morning...  Or actually, probably Friday...  When you brought up the poster situation in the bathroom?  The shitstorm that you were starting?  No.  It wasn't supposed to be like this.  It was just like, hey...  You know...  I wasn't even the first to notice that the posters changed.  Who was?  People came and told me.  Because everybody says I'm the shitstirer.  I think this one, Eric, I have to give credit to you.  You're the one who started shitstirring the poster store. 
[03:39:30]  I made one mention and let it go.  You're the one that ran with this.  I am?  Yeah.  When?  Today.  Did I bring it back up?  Uh, no, but you ran with it when it once it was.  Hey, Sam, let's start a campaign for your poster.  I don't need a poster yet.  Why?  You're doing like 15 radio shows here.  Yeah, but I'm up and coming.  I want O&A to get a poster.  Yeah, but wouldn't it be great if you got one first?  Look, between me and you, Kenny?  Yeah. 
[03:40:00]  Confidentially?  Yeah.  It'd be fucking fantastic.  I would love it.  Would you use a headshot or your illustration?  I would take a new photo for it.  Gotcha.  And when I say new, I mean nude photo for it.  Eric, I wanted to talk to you about Steven Singer.  Wait, I just got a text.  Okay, what is it?  It says, amazing appearance on the shit show.  From who?  I can't talk about it.  Oh, great.  Another thing that just leaves audience members disappointed.  Wait, what do you want to talk about? 
[03:40:30]  Steven Singer now?  Yeah.  Yeah, I hate Steven Singer.  So do I.  Steven Singer Jewelers.  The past few months, you've heard that Steven Singer is the best place to go to buy your holiday presents.  You've heard about his brand new super silver collection.  I told you all about it.  His exclusive naked, get naked collection.  I don't remember telling you about the get naked collection.  And don't forget about his popular black diamonds.  Kenny, have you ever purchased any of the black diamonds?  What do you think, I'm made of money?  They're cheap, Kenny.  They're inexpensive.  I don't want to use the word cheap. 
[03:41:00]  But what you're not reminded of often enough is that Steven Singer is actually the most dominant diamond store in America.  I don't know if this music is appropriate.  That's what he wants.  What's Superman?  It doesn't make sense.  Steven is the absolute best place for you to go for your engagement ring.  I made the journey down to Steven Singer for my rings.  They got the pronouns right this time.  He has the largest selection of loose certified diamonds and an inventory of over 3,000 settings for you to choose from. 
[03:41:30]  His guarantee and warranty is absolutely unrivaled by the competition.  Kenny, I'm not a smart man.  Obviously.  I went down to Steven Singer Jewelers and I walked out an expert in diamonds.  I knew what I was getting.  I knew why I was getting it.  And I knew why my diamond ring that I got for the lovely Miss Jessica was better than any diamond ring that's ever been purchased.  Well, let me tell you something.  When I bought my diamond from Steven Singer.  Yeah, from Steven Singer. 
[03:42:00]  Go on.  Yeah.  I just trusted him.  You did?  Yeah.  You didn't go through the training?  No.  You can't train me.  I'm incorrigible.  A 100% full money bet guarantee.  It's truly risk-free shopping.  So when it's time for the ring, and gentlemen, please your girlfriends, give her a ring.  You know what I mean?  A lot of people date above their heads.  They're not going to stay with you.  Jess wouldn't have stayed with me.  I had to get her the ring, and I made sure I got her a good one.  Don't forget this piece of advice. 
[03:42:30]  Yeah?  You know, marriage comes in three rings.  What three?  First is the engagement ring.  Uh-huh.  Next is the wedding ring.  And then comes suffering.  Go see my friend, Steven Singer.  I don't know.  The copy says he's my friend.  I don't know.  He's my friend like Club Soda Catty is my friend.  No, he's our friend.  Why are you going to be so hurtful?  In Philly at the other corner of 8th and Walnut.  He's a nice guy.  At IHateStevenSinger.com. 
[03:43:00]  Or call him up on the phone.  Yeah, Valentine's Day is coming soon.  At 888-IHATE-StevenSinger.  Look, I've got my engagement ring.  He gives you free shipping, right?  He gives you free shipping.  And if you go in person, because you don't get the free shipping, instead he gives you free cookies.  So I would go in person, because I prefer cookies to shipping.  Are we selling the gold dip roses yet?  No.  Engagement rings is what we were selling.  Oh.  And we're finished selling them.  Oh.  So, but make sure you go see Steven Singer.  You still buy your wife diamonds? 
[03:43:30]  Sam, what'd you do for the long weekend?  You don't answer questions.  You don't answer my questions.  What did I do for the long weekend?  I got some work done around the house.  I got some things done for me, let's just say.  And I was productive.  Could it be any more boring?  What did you do, Kenny?  How was your trip to the Borgata?  We heard about Anthony's trip, a lot of gambling.  A little bit about Opie's trip, having to leave the kid behind for the first time. 
[03:44:00]  What did you do with your trip at the Borgata?  What did you do with your big weekend?  I worked.  What does that entail?  You were there with Norton.  There's a lot to do.  What is there to do?  Well, we did two big shows.  Who's we?  Oh, the guys are done.  I shouldn't say we.  Were you there just with Norton or with the whole group?  No, I worked for the Antisocial Comedy Tour.  Okay, so you can say we, because there's four comedians involved in that. 
[03:44:30]  And it was actually Jim Florentine made a special appearance.  What a treat for the people.  Because you never know what's going to happen with Antisocial Comedy.  Well, it makes me want to think that whenever tickets go on sale for the next set of dates, people should buy them up.  Tickets will go on sale soon.  Are there going to be more dates?  Yes, there will be more dates.  What does your job entail at one of these things?  I do everything.  Like what?  Name a couple of what is everything.  Whatever it takes.  What does that mean?  Do you just stand there? 
[03:45:00]  What does it mean?  Some guy, like on the Antisocial Comedy Facebook page, like at the end, they all do a meet and greet and they sign autographs and take pictures.  Sure.  But when you get like over a thousand people online, you know, people want to stand there and tell every comic their life story.  You know, I got to keep it moving.  So that's part of when the merch line is going around and people want to sit there and have these lengthy conversations with Jim.  Exactly. 
[03:45:30]  I'm just screaming 30 words or less.  Nobody cares.  Next.  Keep moving.  Yeah.  That's very limited.  Yeah.  So you want a hello, goodbye type of situation.  Yeah.  Sign the thing and move on.  Do people get excited to meet you?  Because you're a celebrity yourself.  A few.  Not that many.  There are a few like tainted people that get excited to see.  I don't think that's tainted.  I think that's a nice thing.  Do people get pictures with you?  Do you allow that?  Oh, yeah.  I never refuse a picture. 
[03:46:00]  I, you know, Norton never refuses.  That's not a right thing.  You're an honorable man.  Yeah.  Yes, E-Rock.  I love the way Kenny handles the crowds at one of the virus tours after the show when everyone's doing the meet and greet.  Somebody said something to one of the comics and the comic went, what?  And Kenny goes, he's deaf.  Move it along.  Yeah.  You don't want to sit there and have the conversation.  No.  You got it because there's a lot of people there.  People and then the comics need to go home at some point.  Yeah.  I know people get excited, but it's, it's like a thousand people. 
[03:46:30]  They got to like, you got to go.  How many people does the board got to hold?  In the event center.  Yeah.  Where you guys were.  Two thousand and five hundred.  And they sit there and sign for everyone?  Anybody who wants it.  So you got like, you know, thousands.  Amazing.  Yeah.  Robert in Florida just feedbacked in.  Everything Kenny does leaves the audience disappointed.  I don't know why he would say that.  Yeah.  Why didn't he tell me to my face when I'm going to be at the Fort Lauderdale Improv, February 23rd to the 25th? 
[03:47:00]  You ever get any jerk offs?  Like you ever get any negative sort of things there?  Like any people saying, yeah, Kenny, or thinking that they can bust your balls because ONA busts your balls?  Like, like, you know what I'm saying?  Like that asshole Guy Fieri thought that because ONA busts my balls, then he gets to bust my balls too.  It's not the case for somebody like Guy Fieri.  Maybe get a couple more rings on your fingers and then we'll talk.  I know.  Let it go already.  Well, I don't let things go.  I know.  Stop, stop holding it in, Sam. 
[03:47:30]  Let it go.  You're right.  It'd be healthier for me.  Yeah.  But do you get negative response from people or is it all cool people?  No, you know, mostly people don't like me.  I don't know that to be the case.  And I have a propensity to piss people off.  Only in your personal life, though.  I don't think you piss the audience off.  I think you piss people off around here a lot.  You've gotten into fights with plenty of people here.  Who?  You got into a fight with Danny.  Haven't you been in a fight with Travis before?  You got into fights with work coworkers.  No, they're not fights. 
[03:48:00]  Well, arguments.  A fight is like...  I don't mean fisticuffs.  Yeah.  I mean, arguments.  You exchange words with.  That's up to them.  No, I mean, it's a two-way street.  Takes two to tango.  But I don't think the audience, the listeners, you have that same effect on.  I don't think that they dislike you.  I don't think that they...  For the most part, they do.  You think so?  Yeah.  866-WOW-1-WOW. 
[03:48:30]  866-969-1969.  If you want to call up and talk shit about me.  No, I think it's obvious right now.  Kenny needs some words of encouragement.  No, I don't want them.  Is this because you haven't been asked back to a GTA game?  What is it?  The dodo thing?  Oh, with that guy?  You haven't been asked back, have you?  Yeah, see?  That's just another example.  He doesn't like you, you think?  Yeah, that's just, you know, I fall by the wayside.  That's horrible.  Because you were such an...  You were very impactful in that one game. 
[03:49:00]  Yeah, you would think.  I would think.  Why are you bringing it up?  Are they doing another one?  I mean, GTA V, they released a trailer for it.  You're in it?  No.  So he don't know what he's doing.  He don't have you in it.  All right, let me take some of these.  They're already starting.  You're on after Opie and Anthony Live.  Any kind words to say to Kenny?  I want to hear what they think about him.  He hung up already.  That's not even nice.  How about you?  You're on the show.  Hey, this is Kevin.  Hey, I think Kenny did a good job on Sunday with the troublemakers in the front row. 
[03:49:30]  You were there?  I was there.  What went on in the front row at the Borgata while Jim was playing?  Or, well, the Antisocial Comedy Network, whatever it's called.  There was one really drunk guy and his sister or girlfriend or something.  And he kept getting up and yelling shit.  And Kenny went over and it looked like he had a nice chat with him.  You shut him up?  You want to guess what I said to him, mister?  Uh, no. 
[03:50:00]  Well, like you said, like he kept getting up and yelling.  Yeah.  Yeah, yeah.  So I just went over and very sternly said to him, the next time you get up, it better  be to walk out.  And that was it?  Well, he did a couple times after that.  I was wondering if you were going to go back to him, but he didn't.  Oh.  Well, then I let the t-shirt security handle it.  How often do you have to deal with that?  Is that like an every show occurrence that there's somebody who's out of control?  Because I remember when I went to Harrisburg with Norton, every, there was one show that 
[03:50:30]  wasn't, every show was great except for one show.  Yeah, there's always.  There was one group of assholes.  Yeah, there's always one.  There's always one show in a weekend?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Where it's just like, what the fuck are you doing this year?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  But see, like, I had to rely on, you know, going to the Harrisburg security guards and  telling them, I don't know what this guy's problem is, as opposed to me going up  there.  Because I don't have the intimidating build that you do.  So, Tempe, Arizona next weekend will probably be good crowds, because Jim's never been there 
[03:51:00]  before.  I gotcha.  How about you?  You're on After Open Anthony Live.  612.  It's Lady Trucker.  Lady Trucker, of all the luck.  What do you think of, I know you're a big fan of Sam Roberts, Lady Trucker.  Absolutely.  I've tried so hard to be your biggest fan.  I know you are.  What do you think of Club Soda Kenny?  I love Club Soda Kenny.  Yeah, I love me too.  Hey, Kenny, I was just wondering, how was Santa Claus to you this year?  How was your Christmas? 
[03:51:30]  I'm a Jew, stupid.  You see, this is why people, you're being disrespectful to the audience.  Thank you, Lady Trucker.  You're sitting there, and like, somebody says, I love you, and you're like, you're brushing  them off and saying, I love me too.  And then you called her stupid for asking how your Christmas was.  That might be why some people, you rub the wrong way.  It's a hostile response.  I'll work on it.  Will you, or are you just kind of saying that to get me off your chest?  No, no. 
[03:52:00]  You know I got poor social skills.  Do you want me to give out a prize?  I got a prize.  What, that book?  Well...  Let him get it on book radio.  I was going to say...  That book is just taking up space in the office.  What, are you just getting rid of it?  That's why we give stuff away on this show.  Oh, my God.  Who wants a book?  With all the conversation...  By the way, Kenny, I want you to think of a question to ask for the audience to win  this book.  Okay.  With all the conversation about book radio, we have a book here.  Book radio! 
[03:52:30]  And we're trying to compete.  Who are we trying to compete with, Eric?  Book radio!  That's right.  We're trying to compete with you!  Book radio!  Book radio!  And we have a book to give away now.  Book radio!  It's American Outlaw by Jesse James.  And not only is it signed by the author, Jesse James, who has had sex with a lot of women,  but it's also signed to Anthony from Jesse James.  It's been sitting here ever since. 
[03:53:00]  So call up now, and you can win this prize, which makes us better than the radio station  that E-Rock is about to hit right now!  Book radio!  Yeah!  All right.  Kenny, do you have a question of mine?  I sure do.  Okay.  I'm going to take a brand new, fresh call.  You're on after Opie and Anthony live.  Welcome to the show.  Hey, Sam.  What's your name?  Daniel.  Daniel.  Daniel, where are you from, Daniel? 
[03:53:30]  North Carolina.  Do you have a question, Kenny, for Daniel?  Where is he from?  North Cackalackie.  Oh.  All right.  What's your question, Kenny?  All right.  You paying attention?  Yes, sir.  You ready?  Yes, sir.  What color socks am I wearing?  Black.  Did he get it?  Is the answer to the question, is the answer to what color socks is Club Soda Kenny wearing?  Is the answer black? 
[03:54:00]  You got it!  Congratulations!  Book radio!  Congratulations from us and from our friends at book radio.  I'm going to put you on hold.  You just won this book.  Wait, does he want to go double or nothing?  Do you want to go double or nothing?  If you go double or nothing, I will include the script to the Steven Singer ad that I just read.  And I'm signing it right now.  Listen.  Listen to how I'm signing it.  Listen.  I'll sign it, too.  Do you want to go double or nothing? 
[03:54:30]  Let me stick with the book.  But before you put me on hold, can I say hello to my wife, Autumn?  Yes.  And my brother-in-law, Jesse, over the Christmas break.  He just came out of the closet, so congratulations, Jesse.  Congratulations, Jesse.  Wait, he doesn't want to go double or nothing?  No, he doesn't want to go...  I don't want to lose the book.  I don't want to lose the book.  He's got the book.  You got the book.  I mean, you're a smart gambler.  I'm going to put you on hold, buddy.  Thank you.  All right.  How does he not want to go double or nothing? 
[03:55:00]  He wants to...  I mean, do you want to...  Is there another question that you had in mind?  Yeah, all right.  Okay.  Well, we'll give away this copy, then.  Hello.  Hello.  You're on After Open Anthony Live, and you may just win a copy of the commercial that  I just read, signed by me, and Club Soda Kenny will sign it as well.  The commercial?  Yes, it's the literal piece of paper.  For stupid Steven Singer.  That's right.  That's right. 
[03:55:30]  Is that exciting to you?  Oh, yes.  I can't wait to win a stupid goddamn piece of paper.  That sounds fantastic, sir.  I'm going to go ahead and sign it now.  What else did you want to talk about?  Oh, no.  I thought this was book radio, because fucking Club Soda Kenny was putting me to sleep.  Ouch.  I'm just kidding.  I love that guy.  All right, Kenny.  You got the question for him, or do you not want him to participate now?  No, I want to hear some more jokes about me. 
[03:56:00]  Okay.  You got any more?  No, I was just kidding.  No, I was just poking fun.  He was kidding, Kenny.  No, he wasn't.  You don't think so.  Do you have a question for him?  For the live copy.  Or no?  No, I want to hear more jokes.  He doesn't have any more jokes.  I don't have any more jokes.  No, he called in, and, you know, he wanted to joke around.  I wanted to win that nice piece of paper.  He wants to win the paper. 
[03:56:30]  All right.  So, do you have a question for him to win it?  Yes.  What is the question?  What color is Primetime Sam Roberts' plaid shirt?  That's a great question, because that's two colors.  Is it red and black?  No.  No, it's blue and white, but I don't have all day to take calls to give away this piece  of paper, so I'm going to put you on hold, and I'm still going to send it to you. 
[03:57:00]  Thanks, buddy.  Okay, hold on.  All right.  I'm going to go now, because Rolling Stone is going to be wrapping up, so I have to get  into position.  Well, before you go, Kenny, I did want to tell you about Steven Singer Jewelers.  You just did.  No, I didn't.  The past few months.  Holy mackerel.  You've heard that Steven Singer is the best place to go to buy all your holiday presents  and to get the super silver and to get the naked collection and to get the black diamonds.  You've heard it all, right?  I hate StevenSinger.com. 
[03:57:30]  But what you're not reminded of often enough is that Steven Singer is actually the most dominant  diamond store in America.  Yeah, I got a beautiful diamond ring recently.  Yeah, he's the best place to go for your engagement ring.  I went to see him to get my engagement ring.  Obviously, Kenny, yours wasn't an engagement ring.  It wasn't just one diamond.  It was several diamonds.  Who was your jeweler there?  Was it Steven himself?  Yeah, what do you think?  I don't deal with anybody else. 
[03:58:00]  I go to Turbo Joe.  I didn't even go there.  I do it over the phone.  What do you just call?  1-888-I-HATE-STEVEN-Singer?  No, I got his cell phone.  What is it?  So the people can know.  No, you're not going to trick me.  Good one, Kenny.  You were on top of your shit.  Well, I went down to Philly in person to pick out the engagement ring.  That's a waste of time.  No, it's not a waste of time because I picked the stone.  I picked the setting.  I designed the whole thing.  I talked to Turbo Joe.  It was like a dream come true.  When you could call or do their website, why go to the other corner of 8th and Walnut? 
[03:58:30]  The website is IHateStevenSinger.com.  And the only reason to go to the other corner of 8th and Walnut is number one, because they'll  make you a diamond expert and you can pick out and you can see exactly what you want and  they'll do it all for you.  And number two, they'll give you free drinks and free cookies.  I know that's why E-Rock went with me.  If it's free, it's for me.  Good one, Kenny.  Head on down in Philly to the other corner of 8th and Walnut or go online.  IHateStevenSinger.com. 
[03:59:00]  You can call them up like Kenny does at 1-888-I-HATE-Steven-Singer.  That's Steven Singer Jewelers.  Yeah, it's a very simple process.  It's nothing.  Yeah.  And then he overnights it to you.  And his assistant is hot.  Yeah, Leah.  Is that her?  Leah?  What's her name?  Eric, her name's not Leah, is it?  No.  What's her name?  Oh, man.  I forgot.  Now I had it in my head and then you said Leah.  You said Leah.  There's a broad there named Leah that works there.  There's a lot of good looking women at his store. 
[03:59:30]  Yeah, he surrounds himself with that.  He does it on purpose.  Yeah.  What's her name?  I got so many Steven Bayshores.  Oh, forget it.  Just forget it.  Just forget it.  I don't care that much anymore.  Steve Sterniolo.  I got so many Stevens.  Why is he even in your phone?  Why don't you...  Steven Bamrecker.  Go make sure...  I don't know who that is.  Why don't you...  Here's Steven Singer.  Yeah.  What's his assistant's name?  Jeweler.  Leanne.  Leanne.  Leanne.  Thank you.  Leanne.  Why don't you go make sure that Opie and Anthony are doing okay with their Rolling Stone interview?  We have to go. 
[04:00:00]  I can't wait to see it in print.  What am I, dismissed?  Yes, you're dismissed.  You did great today, though.  You started off very rocky, but you ended strong.  No, I didn't start off rocky.  It was rocky.  Why?  Because I was plugging Jim Norton's shows?  Over and over and over again.  He shot right out of the gate, Sam.  It wasn't good.  Exactly.  It wasn't good.  But you ended strong, and I appreciate you coming on.  You're welcome back anytime.  You're not going to get free tickets to Caroline's if you act this way, Sam.  I have connections at Caroline's now.  I have family.  Yeah, you got invited to the Christmas party.  I didn't. 
[04:00:30]  You didn't?  No, I didn't.  Isn't that funny?  I made it into the Wall Street Journal.  I saw that.  That was from the Caroline's Christmas party.  We got to go.  Stay tuned.  Wait, that same person just texted me again, Leanne.  A little too late.  Stay tuned.  Ron and Fez are coming up next.  New podcast online today.  Goodbye, everybody.  Bye.
