<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast began with a discussion of a Long Island multi-car pileup and tanker explosion caused by black ice.  This transitioned into a review of a listener's comic book, CokeLogic, depicting Opie and Anthony as children in absurd scenarios, including one involving a doll, an apple tree, and oral sex.

The show then heavily featured a heated argument between Sal and Travis, who filled in for Sal during his absence.  The argument, punctuated by vulgar language and insults, centered on Travis's failure to edit a specific audio clip for the podcast, despite Sal's insistence that it should have been done, even though instructions allowed for a delay. Accusations of laziness, passive-aggressiveness, and poor communication flew back and forth, with Sal at one point considering leaving the studio. The argument eventually concluded with a hug, after which the discussion returned to the listener's comic book and plans for upcoming podcasts, including one featuring a prominent porn star.  The segment ended with continued discussion of the Sal/Travis conflict and their upcoming vacation.

Next, the hosts humorously discussed Toronto Mayor Rob Ford seemingly following Opie on social media, George Zimmerman's new Twitter account and the surprisingly high bids for his poorly-executed eBay painting, and Regis Philbin's post-ABC career struggles and Twitter activity. They launched into a critique of perceived laziness and lack of creativity in local news reporting, citing examples of verbatim repetition and comparing it to a Conan O'Brien bit (questioning whether it was plagiarized from Alex Jones). This led to playing audio clips of news anchors arguing and a discussion on purchasing fake social media followers and views. The hosts then heavily criticized a viral YouTube video by a news anchor and his family featuring a rap song, speculating about the inflated view count.  The segment ended with further discussion of social media metrics and a final listener call.

The following segment began with a humorous critique of a 1950s "house of the future" depiction, focusing on its impractical design and excessive use of plastic. This segued into a discussion about the impact of technology (cell phones and the internet) on modern life, compared to life before these inventions.  A detailed analysis of a *Reservoir Dogs* scene about tipping followed, along with a cynical reaction to an iTunes "Best New Podcasts of 2013" nomination.  The segment concluded with an unexpected visit from Bob Lanier, promoting the NBA's holiday giving, and a fabricated story about a radio station falsely claiming a Miley Cyrus interaction at a Jingle Ball event. Multiple listener calls contributed to the discussion.

The show continued with a discussion of their podcast's success (over 100,000 downloads) and upcoming themes ("Mom Stories," a "douchey" episode).  Comedian Ari Shaffir joined the studio. The conversation shifted to Shaffir's views on a documentary about the Tuskegee Airmen, leading to a discussion about the portrayal of Black people in film, racial stereotypes, and the legacy of the Tuskegee Airmen. A call from "Brother Joe" briefly added a military perspective.  The discussion transitioned to Christmas memories, including gift-giving experiences and the Santa Claus myth,  a video of a cruel child prank involving clothes instead of an Xbox, and the "knockout game".  The segment then focused on Shaffir's videos, including one offering Black people free boat rides to Africa as a prank.  This sparked discussion about his other videos, YouTube comments, a wedding with celebratory gunfire causing injuries, and his trip to Europe. Shaffir discussed differing American perceptions abroad, Switzerland's role in WWII, and the Amsterdam red-light district, before being persuaded to download Tinder on air.  The hosts made numerous sexually suggestive comments.


The final segment started with a continuation of the Tinder discussion, focusing on identifying spam profiles, with Shaffir sharing anecdotes including someone liking a nine-year-old.  Shaffir then promoted his "This Is Not Happening" series before leaving.  The hosts then discussed the intern Tyler's interactions with the engineer Mars, highlighting communication breakdowns and perceived rudeness. They compared the current SiriusXM workplace dynamics to their previous location. Tyler's technical skills and social interactions were evaluated, with a caller describing his voice as "elfish".  Finally, comedian and musician Jim Brewer joined the show to discuss his career and upcoming comedy-metal album, recounting meetings with rock stars and his career shift towards family-friendly material while maintaining an edgy tone.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  Greg Audio!  I'm Tonyo.  What about this palaver?  Let's get the show on the road.  Hey.  Yeah, good morning everyone.  There we are.  Oh god, the ice.  The black ice, the black ice, like Jimmy said.  That's right. It's all over the place, right?  It's crazy. Driving in from Long Island.  Oh boy.  I guess they had closed down the expressway last night, parts of it. 
[00:00:30]  Because of the black ice?  The black ice, and then there was a big accident in Brooklyn because of the black ice.  I guess some people didn't phone ahead, Jimmy.  That's right. They didn't call their police departments.  Call their local police department and ask about the black ice.  It's just winter, man.  I don't know.  Let's relax.  Gonna have to deal with some black ice and some snowstorms and some rain  and some slush.  It's just winter, man. 
[00:01:00]  And a 30-car pileup, apparently.  Was it 30 cars?  Yeah, 30 cars.  Oh, okay. That's a little different.  In Brooklyn, somebody didn't stop, you know?  And then you get that whoosh, whoosh, black ice, black ice.  Everybody all right?  I guess so, yeah.  That's good.  And then they had a tanker explosion in like Belmore.  Really?  Yeah, a car hit a tanker, it flipped over, caught on fire,  and then all the flammable liquid from the tanker kind of oozes on fire  into a couple of houses in a Harley dealership.  Anyone dead there?  More explosions. 
[00:01:30]  No.  I guess it was one of those slow motion deals, you know?  Wow.  Yeah.  Where was I, man?  Craziness on Long Island last night.  Well, we got a nice gift from CokeLogic.  Oh, yes.  I see that.  He made a...  Like some Spongebob wrapping paper.  He made like a comic book.  Opie and Anthony Kids.  That's hilarious, man.  By CokeLogic.  Look at...  We're little kids.  Sure. 
[00:02:00]  I'm going to tell CokeLogic right now, I want my taste.  This is fucking...  I want my taste, CokeLogic.  Oh, man.  I see what you're doing here.  I see you've used our images.  Our likeness.  Our likeness without any...  You will be hearing from my lawyer.  That is so fucking cool looking.  But I guess it's me, you, and Jimmy as kids, and we're all best pals.  That's so funny.  I got little army gear on, like a little fatigue jacket and a hat.  I hope he's got a biak-piak on.  A biak-piak. 
[00:02:30]  You're playing with dolls.  And you're up in the apple tree.  Well, because...  This is great.  You want to read the whole thing?  I think it's not that long.  Maybe at least some of it.  Just to let the crowd know what's happening.  That is funny.  Oh, no.  I don't like these back few pages.  Huh?  What happens at the story?  Oh, I see that, too.  Oh, no.  Don't give it away.  Oh, boy.  I think CokeLogic envisions this being a series of comic books. 
[00:03:00]  My little...  Once upon a time, there were two young boys named Opie and Anthony, whose friendship went  far beyond a simple business relationship.  Oh, I'm looking at this.  Bullshit.  Oh, my God.  What?  What happened?  Opie walks over to his best friend, Anthony.  Ooh.  Hey, Ant.  Why weren't you in school today?  Asked Opie.  You missed the big math test.  I totally aced it, because I'm good at math. 
[00:03:30]  Oh.  School blows, Anthony blurted out.  I decided to ditch and play with my toys.  I'll apply myself later in life, when I'm in high school.  Anthony springs to his feet, gleefully swinging his arms, pretending to shoot his action figure  a...  There's some typos in this.  Pretending to shoot his action figure a His Model Rocket.  Yeah, CokeLogic.  You should have had someone proofread this.  A little proofreading. 
[00:04:00]  There's a couple mistakes.  You isolating drunk.  You should have had a friend edit this.  Yeah, call over a friend.  The attack missile bombs the toy soldier.  Goosh, yells Anthony.  Opie interrupts Anthony's ranting.  Brother man, I don't think that's an action figure.  That looks more like a doll, Opie explained.  Anthony's shocked to hear the stops in his tracks.  It's not a doll.  It's a marionette.  I just don't have the strings attached, Anthony retorted. 
[00:04:30]  My dad made the same mistake.  By the way, the picture is George.  Yeah.  Of Otto and George.  Yeah.  Yes, it is.  That's my doll puppet.  Wow, your father looks fucking menacing.  Uh-oh.  Anthony's father overhears the boys talking.  Jesus Christ.  Son of a bitch, Mr. Kumia muttered under his breath.  Anthony, stop playing with that doll.  Okay, Dad, Anthony yelled back.  But it's not a doll.  I'm not a sissy.  Hey, where's Jimmy? 
[00:05:00]  Was he in school today, Anthony asked?  I don't know where Jimmy is.  I didn't see him at school.  Opie continued.  I wonder where he could be.  Muffled noises come from under the porch where little Jimmy plays a game he calls Monster Rain.  A surprisingly loud gulp noise is heard from below.  Realizing the time, Jimmy pops his head up and bolts from under the porch.  Sorry, I have to go, Jimmy said.  In a huff, I have to meet my friends after school.  Jimmy races into the distance. 
[00:05:30]  Jimmy finally arrives to hang out with his best friends, Opie and Anthony.  Hey, guys.  Jimmy greets them.  How are you today?  I did Anthony's part.  How are you today, Anthony asks.  Miserable, Jimmy explained.  I just blew my friend under a porch.  He used my mouth like a woman.  Opie can't believe what he just heard.  He begins to yell, wait, you had a penis in your mouth?  Opie screamed at the top of his lungs.  Opie panics and takes off in a flash.  He runs far, far away from the situation and terrible things he heard. 
[00:06:00]  Anthony and Jimmy follow Opie's trail.  The confused and frightened Opie climbs up an apple tree to hide.  Anthony and Jimmy try to talk him down.  Opie, embarrassed and scared, calls down to his friends below.  I can't come down.  What if someone tries to put a penis in my mouth?  Don't be a silly goose, Jimmy explained.  There's nothing wrong with exploring your sexuality.  There's nothing wrong with exploring your sexuality.  Watch.  Jimmy walks up to a fat girl in the park to ask her a question. 
[00:06:30]  Hi there.  You have two options.  T.O.  Yeah.  You have two options.  He wrote T.O.  You can sit on my lap or sit in the sticker bushes, Jimmy asked.  Sorry, Daddy, the girl sneered.  I'd rather sit in the sticker bushes.  Jimmy feels rejected and hurt.  Seeing Jimmy fail to engage in sexual relations, calms Opie's nerves.  Suddenly, things are not as complicated as previously indicated.  Opie climbs down from the tree to join his friends. 
[00:07:00]  See, you don't have to be scared, Opie.  Jimmy comforts his friend.  Anthony cuts the emotional moment short.  I'm thirsty.  Let's get something to drink.  An old, creepy neighbor watches the three boys and listens to what they say.  Hey, kids.  Why don't you come in for some lunch?  I have some warm papaya juice and sardine oil.  Uncle Paul calls out to the boys.  Well, what do you think?  Anthony asks.  That beats the margarine and sugar sandwich I have for lunch, Opie replied. 
[00:07:30]  Come on, what's the worst that could happen, said Jimmy.  And the three friends ran to Uncle Paul's house to drink warm papaya juice and sardine oil as they laughed and played late into the night until they were molested.  The end.  Yay.  What a happy ending.  Wow, that's great.  No Hollywood cynicism.  He sent these to us as Christmas gifts.

Well done.  I like the illustrations.  They're wonderful.  That's a wonderful Christmas gift.  Thank you, Coke Logic.  He's a very nice, very creative guy.  I'm going to tweet the cover of this fucking thing.  Yeah.  It's pretty funny. 
[00:08:30]  Hell yeah.  I'm going to sue him.  Uh-oh.  Look out.  Uncle Paul's not happy either.  No.  Deformative character.  Portrayed you in an inaccurate light?  No, he didn't show the good parts.  Got me all riled up.  Warm papayages and sardine oil.  It's my favorite food.  Wonderful.  Give you a kiss on the mouth.  Boy, that won't stick with you through adulthood.  If you ever get a whiff of sardine oil cowering in the shower. 
[00:09:00]  Oh, good.  Very nice.  Thank you.  Thank you, Coke Logic.  Thank you.  There's something.  What was it?  Yeah.  Oh, is there a...  We like to do some house cleaning early in the morning  while people are still getting the sleepies out of their eyes?  Aw.  And then we do our real material.  Sure.  Was there a problem this morning?  Oh, yeah.  Oh, boy. 
[00:09:30]  What was today's problem?  Oh, boy.  Come on.  Couldn't be a problem around here.  It's paradise.  No.  Oh.  We got three shows left in this fine year.  Yep.  And then, in the new year, we become a media destination.  Ah.  That's right.  Nice.  That's right.  Well, you know, Sal's been out.  He was out Monday and Tuesday.  By the way, I had no idea.  Holy, I was just going to say that.  I had no idea.  I could have sworn I saw him in the halls or something. 
[00:10:00]  Didn't I see him?  He was actually out?  He was not here.  I know E-Rock was out because we, you know, talked about that for an hour.  Yeah, actually, Roland, E-Rock, and Sal's been out so far a week.  Right.  You didn't know that, Jim?  Well, I've been in touch with Roland a lot via text.  Roland still is present.  Yes.  I got to, you know, he was not happy with the Roland compost.  He didn't like that?  No.  But Roland, I have, uh...  The what?  When I said Roland, instead of Roland Campbell, Roland compost.  Oh, right, right, right.  Basically calling him garbage.  A lump of shit.  Yes.  But Roland, I've been in touch with. 
[00:10:30]  E-Rock, I just, I forgot, was alive at this point.  Yeah.  Right.  And Sal, no, I thought Sal was here.  No, Sal was not here.  And, uh...  E-Rock is deep into his winter slumber.  Oh, yeah.  Do you think he's loading up on winter snacks?  Oh, boy, is he curled up under a pile of leaves?  He's hibernating somewhere for his long winter nap.  Yes.  Bulking up.  But so, Travis was covering for, basically for Eric and Sal completely while they were  gone.  Nice.  And we had a last minute addition. 
[00:11:00]  You know, the podcast came out today.  The O.K.  Anthony podcast.  What's on this week's podcast, by the way?  Get that out of the way.  Well, the original plan was for today's podcast to be Kevin Hart and Big A getting squirted  on.  Oh, that was a good one.  But we had all felt that since Lady Di was so strong...  Wait, can I stop you?  The squirting is by a fine young lady, by the way.  Oh, yeah.  Okay.  Yeah, I think it was...  Well, because squirting just sounds like who gives a fuck, but...  If it's coming out of a vagina, that's what's going to sell the podcast to the families 
[00:11:30]  out there.  And it was somebody...  It was like a famous porn star, too.  It was like...  Was it Sunset Thomas or Flower Tucci?  Was it Flower Tucci?  It was her, right?  We had her in?  Yeah.  Oh.  Yeah, I think it was Flower Tucci.  We were famous.  Oh.  Well...  I don't even remember who it was.  That's very famous.  She's a big squirter.  She's a big name squirter, Flower Tucci.  But we thought that since Lady Di was so strong this week that we had to add her to this  week's podcast.  So Sal does the podcast every week.  He puts the material together and he puts it up there. 
[00:12:00]  Right.  And so I texted him yesterday and said, hey, just so you know, we're adding this.  So come in with enough time tomorrow morning that you can do a quick edit, add it to the  podcast and publish it before we go on the air.  And he asked if Travis had been cutting the worst of bits during the week.  Uh, I asked Travis.  Travis said, no, I have not.  I've been doing everybody else's job.  Uh-oh.  That's low on my list.  My priority list.  Low on the scrotum, Paul. 
[00:12:30]  That's what I say.  Fucking call me up.  Oh, yeah.  He said, I've been prioritizing.  Mm-hmm.  Worst of that we would only really use at the end of the week is low on my priority list.  That's something that Sal can do when he gets back.  I said, okay.  I texted Sal that information.  He was not happy when he heard that, but regardless, I said, that's the information.  And then this morning.  Did you know he wouldn't be happy when he heard that?  Yeah.  He was texting me unhappily.  Okay.  And then this morning, I, it was like 5.15, 5.20 maybe. 
[00:13:00]  And I am watching two guys just screaming at each other.  Wow.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  I mean, Sal is furious that the work hasn't been done.  Travis is going like, what the fuck do you want from me?  Whoa.  What are you talking to me like that for?  Wow.  It was like a real, like, knockdown.  That sounds crazy.  I thought for once everyone was getting along around here.  Oh, man.  Once you get more than three people here, you're not going to have a situation where everybody's  getting along.  Oh, wow.  Okay.  Yeah.  I mean, Travis and Sal were right in the middle of a knockdown dragon. 
[00:13:30]  This isn't the first time those two have gone at it, right?  No.  And it was just as good as the time they fucking started going at it on the air.  I mean, apparently it's not, it's not enough that I cover three jobs.  I should also be doing things that I know nothing about.  Right.  Because Travis didn't know that Sal was going to need that clip for the podcast.  And I told him, I said, if I knew that you needed it this morning, I would have cut  it for you.  But I didn't know.  Oh, so how am I supposed to do something?  I don't know about it. 
[00:14:00]  Well, you're supposed to read minds or something.  Apparently.  Oh, boy.  Sal was mad and felt slighted.  Well, where's Sal?  Where's Sal?  Yeah, we should have him in here.  He's back in the office.  He's babbling.  Let's get Sal out of here.  Someone get Sal.  Sal felt slighted that Travis hadn't done the worst of, because I think Sal probably felt  like, hey, how come you can't cover for me?  You can cover for other people.  What do you think I am?  Some kind of piece of shit?  I covered every single thing that Sal asked me to do in his email, and every single thing  that Eric has asked me to do in his email.  In Eric's email, it said, cut up the worst of if you have time. 
[00:14:30]  If not, Sal can do it on Wednesday.  Oh, boy.  I thought the fight was over First Super Group Asia.  That's true.  No, they're bringing peace and harmony.  Who gave it?  And what was their most popular song?  That didn't even come up in the conversation.  Oh, that's so strange to me.  Look at the iteration we have today.  It's Sal with the lifelike hair.  He's got the beard going.  You never know what he's going to come in with.  What iteration of hairstyle Sal will have.  You've got to go ugly beard, man. 
[00:15:00]  I had it for a little while.  You didn't.  It was pretty long.  He goes well-trimmed hipster.  No neck beard for Sal.  No.  No.  Because the rest of the hipsters aren't growing it on their neck.  What are the hipsters doing these days with facial hair?  Who knows?  Who cares?  Jesus.  Should shave with a shotgun?  That's implied.  He's saying you should shoot yourself.  There's no reason for that.  In the face.  It's early.  It's not even 7 a.m.  It is.  So, Sal, welcome back. 
[00:15:30]  We didn't know you were gone.  For a couple days.  I hope you enjoyed a long weekend.  I did.  I missed you.  Very good.  Thank you.  You didn't.  You said a minute ago.  You didn't know he was gone.  He wasn't here, though.  I heard.  I heard everything.  Oh.  Oh.  All right.  I was listening.  So, what happened?  That's exactly it.  And I just thought.  You have fucking had it with this shit, haven't you?  Well, it was just.  It was just kind of like.  I'm a big fan of people fighting back.  That's what I've tried to tell Eric for years.  Oh, yeah.  That's all I want from that fucking kid.  But there was no sort of come in for Sal and be like, hey, man, what's going on? 
[00:16:00]  Did you get a chance to?  Uh-huh.  And he just walked in like, what the fuck?  Gangbusters.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  I just like.  Erock actually sent out his.  Is he called me Ecock?  Ecock.  He actually did send out the cover email this time, which was awesome.  Yeah.  It helps me out like knowing, you know, what I got to do each day and all that sort of stuff.  Look at Erock working from home.  That's right.  Yeah.  So, in the email he said.  Wait, what kind of email does Erock send out?  Well, first of all, he sends the cover my job email midnight before. 
[00:16:30]  Oh.  Like on midnight Sunday.  These are the things that need to be done in my absence.  Here's the difference between me and Sal and Eric.  When Sal and I are out, we send ours.  Like, Sal sent his cover email like Friday, like three days before anything needed to be covered.  Sure.  And I'll do the same thing.  Eric sends us out at midnight Monday morning, like when everyone is sleeping.  So, you wake up to this email of what you've got to do.  Oh, great.  You can't anticipate anything.  You know what the strategy with that is?  That way, if there's any questions about anything, there's no time to ask. 
[00:17:00]  Oh, you can't even ask.  Yeah, because you know he's already sleeping.  I got you.  That's hilarious.  That's hilarious.  God, I love you, right?  Do you think he does it on purpose just to kind of get it out there?  Of course.  Him and his sneaky little tricks.  See, I'm not sure if he does it on purpose or if he is sitting at home and then goes,  Oh, fuck.  Maybe.  Erica.  Erica.  Erica is the poster of America.  Yep.  We got to get that made.  Someone's got to make Eric as the ultimate American consumer. 
[00:17:30]  Like the Obama change posters, except it just is a picture of Eric and under it it says America.  Yeah.  I picture Iraq in this poster with a lot of stuff around him.  Yeah.  Representing America, if you know what I mean.  But he has to be sitting down.  And instead of change, it says do nothing.  Right.  We got a lot of artists out there.  Yeah.  Work on an Erica poster.  We'll put the best ones on our Facebook page.  That's your Christmas break assignment.  Yeah.  Do it.  You know, because he is the ultimate consumer. 
[00:18:00]  We all know that.  I love the Iraq.  And he knows how to take a shortcut or two.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  Shortcut or two.  You think Iraq will cut corners when he can?  Oh, boy.  But that's America.  That's what I'm trying to say.  He represents way more people than anyone else in this fucking room.  I'll tell you right now.  He's the American dream because he spends so much time trying to figure out shortcuts.  Yes.  That if he could spend less time just doing the work.  Doing the work.  That's the American way.  That's the American way. 
[00:18:30]  That's why I want this done.  I want the Iraq America poster done.  What was that line in Office Space where it's like it pretty much gives you the incentive  to do just enough work to not get fired?  Yeah.  That's like what he does.  Of course.  Just enough to keep your job.  The best place to be is just under the radar.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  Not too far under the radar.  Just under.  Where every once in a while you might see a blip and you go, wait, what was that?  But then they go, ah, I guess that was nothing.  Right. 
[00:19:00]  But it's getting done.  Oh, yeah.  Anyway, go ahead, Sal.  So, no, yeah, that was pretty much that.  I thought that Travis would have done it and so I could come in first thing, get that shit  up there.  Should he come in nice and early?  Yeah.  5.50?  Yeah, I took a cab and say my fucking train again is being retarded.  What time did you get here?  Like 10 after.  That's cool.  10 after 5.  So, yeah, I mean, that's exactly what happened.  I asked Travis and then we were met with him. 
[00:19:30]  But you didn't ask Travis.  You weren't like, hey, buddy.  Did you get the.  I said, I said, did you give.  Do you have the worst of?  Because that's just something that Sam told you yesterday that I didn't.  So why would you even ask?  Well, I because I specifically said to Sam, maybe he's going to do it between now and now  and tomorrow.  I don't want to.  I don't.  I wouldn't.  Why would I fucking just like fabricate a situation?  Maybe you could took took it home or something like that.  There's many scenarios.  Any scenario.  Only worry about the problem when it's finally addressed and when you absolutely need to come  to it.  I mean, nobody told me.  So I don't know how I was supposed to cut it up for you. 
[00:20:00]  But how did you know that Sam informed me about that information?  If you didn't know.  Sam told me.  Sam asked, have you been cutting up worst of?  And I said, no.  So that's how I knew.  Uh huh.  OK.  Sam didn't tell me.  Oh, by the way, I'm going to ask Sal to cut up the lady die phone call for tomorrow  morning.  Don't do it.  When you told me that the lady die phone call needed to be on the podcast this morning,  that was the absolute first time I had heard about it.  But Sal was pissed generally. 
[00:20:30]  Yeah.  That the worst of wasn't being cut up while he was gone.  Well, yeah.  Because now like when we do worst of the right way to do it is you got to listen to that  thing in real time.  Like you got to go back.  You got to listen to.  Lucky you.  Hilarious.  Yeah.  I bet you do that off the clock.  Just for pleasure.  I wasn't here.  So I didn't hear the show.  That's why like when you're up to do more stuff, he supposedly heard the show that day  or that segment.  Oh, boy.  Yeah.  You get to bathe in our greatness.  Yeah.  All right.  For free.  What a job.  You get paid to do that.  That should be your pay. 
[00:21:00]  You just get to listen to this.  Right.  The privilege of listening again.  I love listening to you guys.  Anyway.  So now I didn't hear the show.  I'm sorry.  Not to offend you guys.  I didn't listen to the show Monday or Tuesday.  What about the part where you said I love listening to you guys?  That's true.  What happened?  You just said that.  Well, I don't want to like have a dick sucking fest here, but I don't listen to you guys  forever.  Why not?  Geez.  What the hell?  We weren't talking about dick sucking.  Jesus.  That just brings that out of nowhere.  Oh, my God.  That out of fucking thin air. 
[00:21:30]  That's a little weird.  But yeah.  So I didn't hear the show.  So I have to now go in and carefully listen to it.  And it takes a while.  So therefore the podcast.  Nobody's saying you do.  I could do that today.  But I didn't have any time to do it on Monday and Tuesday when I'm doing the job of three  people.  Oh, it's low on the list now.  Would you say that if you were doing the job of three people and you didn't need something  done until Friday, you would probably push it until you had more time?  Well, one thing is we don't need that until Friday.  Wait, wait, wait. 
[00:22:00]  There it is.  What?  The moment where I just don't give a shit anymore.  There it was.  It was right then and there, people.  You're not interested?  I could give a fuck.  Me too.  Shut up.  You don't like the back and forth?  Please.  No.  No, it's just ponderous and fucking, it's tedium.  But why were you guys screaming?  I guess it's just this early in the morning, everyone's just fucking on it. 
[00:22:30]  Because after two days of doing three jobs, the last thing I want to hear is why didn't  you do something you didn't know about on top of all that shit?  It said it in the email, though.  Yeah, it said in the email that I could push it off on you on Wednesday.  So that's just like, that's sad.  So that's what it said in the email.  That's sad, dude.  Is it really sad that I did three fucking jobs for two days?  I always cover for everyone here.  Really?  So you've come in before and you've done the prep sheets, the news stories, you've run  the board, you've sent Audible, you've done the replay, you've pulled the live reads, 
[00:23:00]  you've sent the live reads.  You've done all that before?  Really?  Yes, I can do every one of those jobs.  And you've done it all in a day?  Yeah, there's been a scenario, probably.  There's been a day where me and Eric have been out and you've had to do all of that.  Sure.  Really?  Yeah.  Go find that day because I guarantee you it has never happened before.  I'm sure there's a day where other people have been out and I've had their cover for  That has never happened before.  Look, I'm not getting all riled up over this.  You're clearly more upset about having to do extra work.  Oh, man!  Holy shit!  When someone says, you can do this or you can wait until someone else does it, I just 
[00:23:30]  like, me, as a person, I like to just fucking do it and get it done because then I can say  I did it.  Yeah, shut up right in.  I didn't have time.  I'm sorry you didn't have time.  But sometimes, like, I don't know.  That's all.  I didn't have time to do it.  You're saying you should have made time.  I think five.  Yes.  Five goes here.  That's all.  That's all.  I'm done.  That's it.  I'm not getting riled up.  I don't want that in my life anymore.  I don't want to get all that.  You're the one who came in with a fucking bitchy attitude.  Oh, bitchy.  The B word. 
[00:24:00]  I asked.  I asked.  You're not a real man.  That's not like a manly thing.  No, no.  That's like a girly thing.  Bitchy attitude.  It's a man.  A bitchy attitude.  That just conveys, like, that you're kind of fruity.  I asked you if you had it and you go, I was doing three jobs.  You were told yesterday what the situation was.  I told you I wouldn't make an assumption until I came into work where all the media and  all the shit is to see if you had done it.  There's a strong chance you could have done it at home.  So, maybe, why would I put that on you that you didn't do it?  Maybe I thought you took the initiative afterwards.  Maybe you thought there was going to be a dick-sucking fest here.  Right. 
[00:24:30]  Absolutely.  I was hoping, too.  That's all.  Bitchy is like, if somebody's like, oh, you came in here all bitchy, you're not going to  take somebody seriously when they're being bitchy.  That's like the wife is being bitchy.  She's on her period.  Yeah.  That's what Travis was comparing.  Travis met with me with hospitality.  He was on the rag.  Yeah.  He was bleeding from the twat.  Yeah, he is.  Just like how he did now, he started getting all riled up.  Yeah, because you know what?  After two days of doing three jobs, that's the last thing I want to hear.  Two days, three jobs. 
[00:25:00]  We all work for the show.  Sal, you're the laziest fuck here.  Are you kidding me?  How many times?  How many fucking hours?  You still don't give a shit at him?  Now he's just slurs at him.  Sal, how many times have they brought you into the studio and called you out on your laziness?  Don't talk to me after I've done a laundry list of shit for two days.  And I didn't pull something that I didn't know about.  You did Danny's job plus Audible.  I didn't pull something that I didn't know about.  Please, Travis.  Please, dude.  Come on, Sal.  I didn't even know.  Come on, bro.  Do you want to specifically go over it? 
[00:25:30]  I didn't.  Do you really want to specifically go over it, dude?  Do you want to do that right now?  Do you want to talk about when you leave early because you've got to catch a fucking train  or whatever bullshit?  Whoa!  Don't fucking tell me there wasn't time because there's always time.  Work ethic problems.  There's always fucking time because I always fucking stay here late.  I'm always here fucking late doing shit.  And I don't fucking complain about it.  Sal, I don't complain about it either.  You're complaining about it right now.  You're complaining about it right now, Travis.  What I'm complaining about is that you couldn't believe that I didn't do something that I didn't know about. 
[00:26:00]  I came in and asked you nicely and you started bitching at me.  That's exactly what happened.  This is boring, Anthony.  Thank you for talking about it.  No, no, I'm back in.  We're the thing.  I like this now.  If Sam had told me yesterday.  No, really, Sal?  Well, the jerk star called.  I already explained this to you and then you apologized to me.  So, like, you know you were on the book of God.  I had a bitch move.  It's a bitch move.  Because I had to get...  I'm sorry.  I'm sorry.  I pulled a...  I will admit, I pulled a passive-aggressive move.  I said, I'm sorry because I didn't want to fucking hear him call me to tell me to fucking 
[00:26:30]  calm down and shit anymore.  Oh, that's what you're doing.  You're like, I'm sorry.  You just go, yeah.  You take the grenade just to cover the fucking problem.  I'm going to go start working.  Oh!  Because you were...  Oh, shit.  Because you were told to come in and work on it.  I had no problem.  You knew the situation.  I don't care doing the work.  It has nothing to do with the work.  I'm fine with that.  It's the matter of that you know that if you just don't feel like doing the fucking work,  you could pawn it off on me.  Did anyone ever see that Star Trek episode where that cloud thing fed on? 
[00:27:00]  It fed off the violence and it loved the hate that was going on between the Klingons and  the Earthlings.  That is Sam right here.  I'm seeing Sam soaking up this hatred and conflict and just converting it into energy.  Which, by the way, you are also looking very happy right now.  I love it!  You were tapped out a minute ago and you're all in now all of a sudden.  I'm in because then the voices started raising.  I'm like, huh?  What? 
[00:27:30]  You like that.  I like it, too.  Oh, I love it.  And this just feels like home to me.  Oh, no!  I'm back at my family home.  Yes.  See, the one thing I, if I may jump in for a second.  You're diffusing, though, man.  I know.  We're losing the energy by the moment.  I know.  I don't want to, but here's, here's, I might stoke the flames again by just saying this.  Yeah.  I still don't understand who is kind of in the right and who is in the wrong here.  I don't even know what really happened. 
[00:28:00]  There is no right and wrong.  There is no wrong.  What happened?  Somebody didn't do something.  No, not at all.  And someone was supposed to do it.  So, and I still don't know.  What?  Sal, Sal was supposed to cut something up for this morning.  Sal was supposed to cut up something for this morning.  Uh-huh.  Okay?  I would have happily done it yesterday if I knew that it was a time-sensitive thing.  It was sent in the fucking email.  It was sent in the email and you interpreted, you interpreted, you made it a projection upon  yourself that I don't have to do this because Sal will do it Wednesday morning in the event 
[00:28:30]  that we needed that material, which you didn't do.  Yeah, because I have more important things to do.  Oh, my God.  Sal, when something is not needed until Friday, I can push it a day.  Apparently, it wasn't needed until Friday.  It was needed fucking Tuesday morning at 3 a.m.  And did I know about that?  What does it matter?  It said it in the fucking email to do it.  Because that's the whole point, Sal.  If it's not timely, it can be pushed to later in the week.  If it is timely, it'll get done.  That you know, you want to say whatever you want to say on the air, but you know deep in  your heart, you interpreted, do it Monday, Tuesday, or Sal can do it Wednesday. 
[00:29:00]  You don't even fucking address the first two parts of that.  You just say, hmm, Sal.  Okay, Sal.  When I see something can be pushed till Wednesday, I'm going to push it till Wednesday because  I've got other things to do on Monday and Tuesday.  We've been here for two years.  We've been doing it every fucking day.  We've been doing it every longer as an intern.  We've been doing it every...  I thought you still were.  We cut up worst stuff every day because it's something...  If Ope says, hey, do we have that clip from yesterday?  Because we could pull it up like that. 
[00:29:30]  That's the fucking case.  Especially being on the board, you would think.  You would fucking think you had that shit ready to go.  Yeah, and I would have if I needed it to go.  But I didn't need to cut up...  But you had to catch your train to get home or whatever your...  Whoa!  Like, you're saying there's no time.  There's always time.  You can just stay at work later.  Sal, it's some devastating blows.  You don't know what I can do and what I can't do.  Roland says you're at a fucking midnight sometimes.  You don't know what I can do.  Homeless.  Could be some food coming.  That could be a problem.  I don't know what you can and can't do.  You're right.  I don't know what you're willing to put into the show. 
[00:30:00]  You're right.  You don't...  First of all, you will never put in what I put into the show.  Right.  Okay.  All right, go ahead.  Like, say an extra...  Worst of all, what does it take?  It takes maybe an extra hour from...  Yeah, and Sal, maybe I didn't have an extra hour.  I'm sorry.  Maybe I've got other things to do.  I understand.  Maybe I have a family at home that depends on me to be there at a certain time.  Oh.  Okay.  Insinuating that you can't have children with a woman.  Right.  Right.  Because you can't get a boner.  Right.  Okay.  And if that's more important than your fucking career... 
[00:30:30]  Maybe I've got a more delicate...  I don't know what to tell you.  Ooh, what?  Time spent here, Sal, doesn't necessarily mean you're putting in the work.  You're just here.  I mean, some people might be able to manage their time better than you.  No.  I'm just saying that.  I like that.  I am absolutely willing to stay late to do shit.  I have no problem with doing that.  I'm not going to take any of your little baits of like, well, maybe you don't care about  your career.  I've been here nine years.  Nine years!  Holy shit.  I think I'm doing a pretty damn good job.  That's some seniority right there.  Yep.  Okay. 
[00:31:00]  And that's fine.  People pass over to me.  It's perfectly fine.  But I just know...  There's a new kid in town.  Johnny on the spot here.  I absolutely fucking know.  You interpreted that information that E-Rock gave you as, I don't need to fucking do it.  Sal will do it.  I'm telling you, I interpreted it as, it can wait until Wednesday.  And that's what it did.  Sal, were you covering for anybody that wasn't here?  Every time Travis is up, I cover his entire time.  Everybody does a great job covering for everybody.  Oh, that's right.  He wasn't here Monday and Tuesday. 
[00:31:30]  Correct.  He wasn't here Monday or Tuesday.  Mm-hmm.  So...  And neither was E-Rock.  Yeah.  When E-Rock isn't here, I cover for E-Rock.  When Travis isn't here, I cover for Travis.  So you and E-Rock weren't here.  Sam and Travis were.  Correct.  So they are covering, obviously, for you and E-Rock.  Absolutely.  And then you come in, middle of the week, and give people shit about...  See, that's all I'm getting here now.  They obviously had to cover for two people down for two days. 
[00:32:00]  Right.  You come in and start giving them shit?  Well, no.  It was...  I explained the particular detail.  It's not the overall...  I understand what you're saying.  Of course you do.  I hope so.  But it's the...  It's that one element.  Not only not giving people shit, but a thank you.  Sometimes you just need to strip it down to the basics.  Right.  Strip it right down to the basics.  We can...  I don't know.  Oh, boy.  Oh, boy. 
[00:32:30]  Oh, you want to tap out now?  That deflated him a little bit.  I explained my point, and...  Sal doesn't agree, though.  It's falling on deaf ears?  Is that what you're saying?  No, I'm not saying that.  Oh, boy.  But why don't you go with what Anja said?  I agree with it.  Absolutely.  I just...  I said the thing that irritated me was that specific element of what he did.  Oh, boy.  I think there's more stuff at play here.  I think so.  It just happened to be the straw that broke the camel's back.  Ah.  Underlying element.  I don't know.  I'm a fatty rock joke there somewhere, but... 
[00:33:00]  I don't know.  We should call it, Iraq.  We should definitely call it, Iraq.  Yeah, let's see what he says about it.  He'd love it, because he's like, see, I'm not in there, and the place falls apart.  Yeah.  I mean, it's not falling apart.  Everything is getting done.  Of course it is.  Swimmingly.  Yeah.  The fact of the matter is, we're three days before vacation.  If I see a fight going on, we got to...  I mean, if we can fill an hour, we can fill an hour.  Oh, fuck yeah.  It's all about filling these hours.  There's nothing falling apart here.  Can I go get you, Iraq, online?  Is that cool?  Oh, wow.  He's not going to answer.  He will never answer at this hour. 
[00:33:30]  He's on to us, finally.  Can you see that?  It only took him nine years, but he's on to us, finally.  Sal, you talk about being a quick learner.  He's going, wait a minute.  I'm kind of in the barrel now, because they have figured out that my argument was not great.  Deflect.  What I can do is shit on Iraq something.  No.  I would never be.  Let me get him on the phone.  Let me get him on the phone immediately.  That's a big pile of shit that just fell in my head, and I need to dump it on someone.  But in order to call him, I have to be out of the studio.  All right.  See you guys later.  All right.  Final thoughts.  Ah, final thoughts. 
[00:34:00]  I like that.  Final thoughts.  Summation.  In summation.  Let's get an apology from somebody.  Oh, wow.  I agree, Sam.  An apology always heals.  I already got one, so...  Oh.  Oh, boy.  This passive-aggressive...  That was a passive-aggressive, you're-a-bitch apology.  Yeah, that was...  You said you were sorry already.  Yeah.  I'm not genuinely sorry at all.  It's just...  When you say I'm sorry to the wife, because you don't want the argument to keep going,  you're not really sorry.  Well, we all know all sorries are bullshit in our song.  Of course. 
[00:34:30]  I don't need an apology.  I know that I do a good job, and nobody knew Sal was out, so that must mean I do a good job.  Oh.  I don't even want to...  What?  I wouldn't want to come back from that either.  You don't want to what?  You don't want to what?  And when you're not here, dude, you...  When I'm not here, I hear...  When I'm not here, it's brought up on the air, the lower quality of the prep.  Oh!  Holy shit, a devastating blow. 
[00:35:00]  Yeah.  Ah, getting us involved.  Oh, shit.  Now we're stuck.  Oh.  Oh, he's not lying.  They're undeniable truth.  Sal may be in line for the bare-bottom spanking.  Sal, you've got to fight your way out of the corner.  Wow.  Sal, what are you doing?  Like, literally...  Fight your way out of the corner.  Let's go.  Okay, when...  This is it.  So I'm doing rope-a-dope without that rope part.  Oh, I got it.  When you write your cover email to me, it is literally only what Danny did. 
[00:35:30]  Therefore, I'm not sure...  Oh, that's like Obama with George W. Bush.  Why?  The hell are you blaming fucking the past administrations?  Look, I'm not...  Look, therefore, I'm not sure what you did prior to then.  I know you do Audible now, and I was...  That's only because you absorbed something that Sam was doing.  So I really don't fucking know what you were doing prior to then.  You're not paying attention, Sal.  I'm not paying attention?  Okay.  And...  Oh, gosh.  I can't do this right now.  Oh!  He's walking. 
[00:36:00]  He's walking.  Wait, what happened?  Oh, my God.  Sal's walking.  You're going to look really bad if you just walk.  I'm getting anxiety right now.  Why anxiety?  Why?  You've got to just speak your mind.  No, because I can...  Don't get anxious.  Either admit...  Why are you getting anxiety?  What's going on?  Nothing.  I...  What?  What?  Oh.  You can't walk out like that.  You know what?  I think this needs...  Let's get Troy Kwan in here to...  Yeah.  No?  What?  To tell you both what you are.  Troy L.  I can say this.  The company's still not over the Troy Kwan thing.  Oh, boy. 
[00:36:30]  Oh, man.  Oh, boy.  I thought a different season would relax everybody.  I thought it might be an easy one.  Wow.  Oh, boy.  Are they not over that.  That was a biggie.  Yeah.  No.  Ah, boy.  What's Sal?  Sal.  Oh, Sal.  Sal.  Sal's ready.  He had the headphones off.  He was ready to walk.  Why are you having anxiety?  I just don't want to argue over something that's so fucking boring.  Yeah, like, that's the thing.  Like, when you break...  I know you guys are looking for, like, material here.  What?  But, like, in the end, it's really a petty thing.  Oh. 
[00:37:00]  Besides the yelling part.  But who do you think is a little bit more petty?  I really don't care.  Oh, wow.  I'm just like, Sal.  Like, I don't care to argue.  Why don't you guys hug it out, then?  No.  I'll hug Sal.  I don't want any hugs.  Hug.  Hug.  Hug.  Hug.  Hug.  Hug.  Hug.  If it's not worth arguing about, we can hug.  Hug.  That's true.  We only got a few shows left in the year.  We can't not.  Yeah, we can't go into the new year like this.  No, we're going to start over as we become immediate destination.  And I know that I can speak for myself when I say, I don't want this to end negatively. 
[00:37:30]  Oh, look.  Oh.  They're hugging.  Kiss.  Kiss.  Kiss.  Kiss.  Kiss.  Yeah.  Let's see who's bigger down there.  Let's see who's bigger.  Oh, I'm glad that's taken care of.  It's 6.30.  Yeah?  Well, we figured we'd get 20 minutes out of it.  Yeah, squeeze a little bit.  I think Sal gets a little emotional and upset.  Sal does.  Sal does.  Sal, you cry when you get angry?  No, I don't.  Okay.  Being like the bitch that Travis called him. 
[00:38:00]  And guys don't get anxiety.  You're puss.  Oh, come on.  You guys don't get anxiety?  You need a little xandex?  You need a xanny?  No, I don't compensate with, like, the, you know, with guys get anxiety.  Religious?  I'm just fucking making a dumb joke.  Did you get a little anxiety attack right there when you were ready to leave?  I wanted an anxiety attack, but it just started, like, I get that, like, full anxiety.  Building up?  Yeah, it's like.  Oh, boy.  I think he did.  I think, I bet Jim's right.  I bet if Sal gets really mad, I'll bet he cries because he gets emotional.  Oh.  And so he has to keep it to a certain level. 
[00:38:30]  Again, adhering to that bitch title that Travis gave him just earlier.  But it's not crying like you're sad and weepy.  It's an angry cry.  I used to do that same thing.  Yeah.  I don't think I've ever done that.  That's because, because you throw your headphones off, you go, I can't even do this right now.  I can't even do this right now.  Just stop.  Oh, okay.  She's getting a little upset again.  I just don't have less anger in my life.  That's all.  Why do you have anger?  You always have a good, you always seem happy.  No, I go from, like, zero to a hundred, like, very, very.  Whoa, look out. 
[00:39:00]  I've never seen that.  I'm getting stuff done.  You've never seen that.  What, your IQ?  Well, no.  I think another thing with Sal, and I don't blame him for this.  Oh, no.  I hate when they team up.  Yeah.  Yeah, what is this?  He's been beaten by a lot of people on our show.  Are you talking about specifically O.B. Anthony and Jim?  Yeah, that might be who I'm talking about.  I've left him alone lately.  I think I've been very careful.  All right, Sal?  So everyone is.  Literally, like, just before he came in, you guys said you had no idea that he wasn't here.  Like, literally, this morning.  That's kind of... 
[00:39:30]  That's just a dumb joke, bro.  Like, joke, right?  We're just concentrating more on us.  We're just pulling down a stupid wall now.  On our own lives.  We're so self-centered, we just pay attention to our own lives.  Sal used to drive me insane, but he's kind of...  Dresses a little less, uh, provocatively.  But he's absolutely improved, so...  He sticks up for himself, and, yeah, you know...  Like, two weeks ago.  And he's working harder, and I think he got some of our messages. 
[00:40:00]  I don't expect people to get all of our messages, because it might be our craziness or my craziness.  But he does fight back.  Yeah, I like that.  Oh, he will.  He fights back, and he also...  I think he panics a little when he thinks that he might be getting a beatdown on the air.  And, like, two...  Let me just...  Because of what you guys have done in the past, like, two weeks ago, the podcast wasn't uploading at six in the morning.  And it was no fault of his.  It was the software that just wasn't uploading it.  And I'm like, bro, it's cool.  Like, calm down.  It's not your fault.  It's not your fault.  He's like, yeah, but it's not going to get uploaded.  Oh, boy. 
[00:40:30]  He's like, can you tell Opie?  I'm like, yeah, of course.  Like, it's cool, dude.  Like, don't worry.  The fucking bro part should have cooled it out.  These are great days, bros.  Bros.  Bros.  Yeah.  Let's go talk about it in the bathroom.  Yeah.  Let's have a little bathroom meeting about this.  See, we started in a very angry place, and now they're just about ready to kiss.  Sal knows I like him.  We're back to fun and games.  I don't like it.  I don't know if Sal likes me, but Sal knows I like him.  No, I don't.  I don't.  You don't like Travis? 
[00:41:00]  No, I do.  You just said, no, I don't.  He said, no, I don't live with hate.  I don't like people to hate people.  It's just a bad thing.  I've heard that.  Triumph.  It's a good social message.  Kind of nice.  Except for Danny.  It's fun.  He's not even here to defend himself.  You don't like Danny?  No, he was really mean to me.  Wow.  Danny's our employee that hasn't been here for a year.  Has it been?  Yeah, yeah.  For a year and a half.  How long has it been?  A year.  A year.  Has he ever gotten a year?  Yeah.  Wow.  Jesus.  You still harboring some resentments over that one? 
[00:41:30]  Yeah.  I don't like him.  Wow.  Jesus.  He's superfluously mean to me.  Awesome.  Yeah.  Anyway.  I think you could find some camaraderie in that statement.  Anyway.  Thank you guys.  I appreciate it coming.  All right, Sal.  Talk to you guys soon.  You got it.  There goes Sal.  Go pull that worst up I didn't do.  Oh, shit.  That was pretty much, now go get your fucking shine.  Right, of course.  By the way. 
[00:42:00]  Travis was in the right on that one.  Oh.  Yeah?  I, from what I heard, which I was listening with half an ear anyway, I think I got that.  Not just the fact that, you know, Travis and his lovely wife and beautiful daughter come  to my house for the holidays and whatnot.  Very excited.  But, I just think, you know, yeah, I think Travis had him there.  Yeah.  Sal will get a little scrappy with anything.  He'll try to fight his way out even if he knows he's wrong.  I like that, though. 
[00:42:30]  Yeah.  Yeah, you got it, you know.  I like when they start calling each other bitches.  I like that bitch and fucking bro.  Bro.  I gave him a passive aggressive, I'm sorry, I didn't mean it.  I like, my favorite part was listening to the angry bro versus loving bro.  That was very cool.  One like bro, like, it's okay, bro.  And the other one was like, fuck you, bro.  Oh, really, bro?  And then it's like, no, I said, hey, bro.  I was like, hey, bro, I can help you.  It's not your fault, it's the software.  Yeah, yeah, it's the software, bro. 
[00:43:00]  Oh, fuck yeah.  And then it's like, really, bro?  Oh, man.  Hey, bro.  Bro.  That was terrific.  Yeah.  That was a good one.  All right, we should take a break, huh?  Damn.  Woof.  Really?  Get the radio show started.  Yeah.  I heard that, I heard that argument didn't go unnoticed by some people around here either.  Oh, no.  Oh, yes.  What happened? 
[00:43:30]  A certain air talent.  Because of construction, has to now walk through various areas of the building that they usually  don't have to walk through.  Oh, he actually has to walk through the company?  Yeah.  Instead of being isolated?  Yeah.  He walks in and he sees these two guys just screaming at each other.  Screaming at each other.  Quarter after five.  Woof.  Woof.  Woof.  Woof.  Woof.  Woof.  Woof.  Woof.  Woof.  Woof.  Yelling over there.  I don't get it.  It was funny.  It was funny.  I'm fighting like cats and dogs.  As a matter of fact, I got some up for adoption. 
[00:44:00]  Meow.  Oh, boy.  Oh, the food just arrived.  Let's take a break.  Perfect timing.  I'm hungry.  We got a lot of wacky news shit to do next.  Yes, we do.  Meaning news channels.  Zaniness has been happening in the news.  You got the Wichita guy who said, let's get the fuck out of here.  Is he a lineman?  Oh, very good.  Ah.  Very good reference.  Glenn Campbell.  Also, the Conan O'Brien montage is hilarious. 
[00:44:30]  That was such a good one.  I watched that last night.  Hilarious.  The longer it went, the funnier it got.  That's his thing, right?  Yeah.  That's the second one he's done?  Yeah, that might be his best bit.  That is a good bit.  Where they show that these people are doing the same shit?  It's like Prep Burger, yeah.  That's the type of bit that Conan's doing and probably driving Kimmel nuts.  Right.  That's a Kimmel fucking thing.  Yeah.  It blows my mind.  It's crazy.  It blows my mind.  Basic, simple stories.  You would think that people would get together and just write a little something.  Something different. 
[00:45:00]  It's not that complicated, but they read the exact script.  It really is.  At every news channel.  And we'll have that for you after the break.  It's great.  We'll do that.  And yeah, the news anchor that did his Christmas rap song video.  And if any, you know, yelling and fighting happens during the break, I'm sure we'll cover that  here.  Absolutely.  People just can't stay away from each other's fucking throats.  Why don't we get one of the fighting clips on the air from the news?  Oh, that is a good one. 
[00:45:30]  There's another one besides the LA one we used to play.  Yeah.  Or Chad.  We did Chad recently.  Chad.  Well, if you let me talk, I saw the pressures of 900 milliparts.  And then, but in 1960, it was 912 milliparts.  I hope the next fight we have on the air ends with somebody going, I was only kidding.  I was only joking.  Yeah.  I was just having some fun.  Just having some fun.  I was just having some fun.  Just rubbing you, bro.  You weren't. 
[00:46:00]  We got any fighting clips?  Maybe that LA one.  I don't know if you've played that LA one in a while.  I don't like that one.  What, the way they have a couple shooters and you're a different lady.  Boy, he had her.  She didn't expect him to go there.  She didn't expect him to mention her alcoholism.  Oh, no way.  That was great.  He got that shit.  Tough guy.  I don't know what Eric would have called that.  Uh-oh.  But Sal would have had it.  Yeah.  Probably.  I've got a whole folder of news clips. 
[00:46:30]  All right.  We'll just go to break that.  That's cool.  Yeah.  Fuck it.  We'll return after these messages.  Happy birthday, Keith Richards.  Oh, my goodness.  The big 7-0.  Holy fuck.  Damn.  Something to be said for taking a lot of drugs.  Well, that's the gag.  Yeah.  People have gone with me for, what, 20 years now? 
[00:47:00]  Oh, look.  Rob Ford dancing to the Stones.  That's great.  He loves the Stones.  Look at him.  He's dancing to the Stones.  Oh, it's dancing.  Oh, it's a montage of the Rob Ford.  He's still great.  I want to give a big F you to the listeners.  What?  What happened?  Rob Ford was following me.  I don't know how that happened, but Rob Ford, the Toronto mayor,  was following me, and then everyone went,  holy shit, Rob Ford is following you.  Guess what?  Oh, wow.  What?  Day later, Rob Ford wasn't following me anymore. 
[00:47:30]  Oh, no.  I think Rob Ford panicked a little bit.  What happened?  On his old follow.  I don't know what happened.  I think it had something to do with the listeners all the fucking tweeting and saying,  Rob Ford's following you.  I have somebody that just joined Twitter that I would like to follow me.  Yeah.  George Zimmerman is now on the Twitter.  Oh, gosh.  Apparently, he's tweeting a lot of religious stuff.  Is he?  And tweeting about his painting that's up on eBay, I guess.  Yeah.  I don't think that's a legit offer. 
[00:48:00]  The news is making it sound like the people are offering somebody,  the bids are up to over $100,000 for his painting.  It's like a paint by numbers, though.  Hey, it's an original George Zimmerman.  What makes it a real show?  He plagiarized a little?  Yeah, of course he did.  Yeah, this flag is like a stock flag.  Wait, so he...  And every wrinkle, it looks like he just painted over it.  Yeah, he took a stock photo and then just kind of made it his own.  And put some text on it. 
[00:48:30]  And just made it all like a blue tint American flag.  You should buy it.  Photoshop.  Not for $100.  Yeah.  Snapfish on canvas and then like...  There you go.  Right.  Yeah.  Yeah, it's probably not even paint.  There he is, though.  I think I read that that's like on the first or second page of stock photos if you type  in American flag.  Oh, my God.  Really?  Hey, $100,000.  Wow.  I think those are fake offers.  I don't think anybody...  Right there.  Isn't that it? 
[00:49:00]  The second photo?  That's the second one, right?  Yeah.  Oh, my God.  He was like, no, the first one's not good.  That's it.  He sucks.  That's a little GZ on the Twitter, though.  Him and Regis is a new addition to Twitter also, and you just cannot read his tweets  without doing it in the Regis voice.  Right.  Just yelling.  Wait, Zimmerman's on Twitter now?  Yeah, yeah.  GZ's on Twitter.  And Regis.  Man, Regis was trying to hold up ABC, and they said, go fuck yourself, Regis, and now 
[00:49:30]  he's still looking for a gig.  Oh.  He didn't want to retire.  Do you think he tried to hold him up or were they just done with him?  Oh, hell yeah, man.  I don't think they were done with him.  You don't think they were trying to just force him out?  No.  Get some younger blood in there?  No, they probably wanted to sign him for a little less.  Yeah.  Now, uh...  You don't have to follow him on Twitter.  What could he possibly say?  Oh, I follow him now.  Oh, do you?  No, just because I, like I said, I like reading his tweets and his voice.  What's his last five tweets?  Uh, what did he tweet? 
[00:50:00]  Uh, let's get past some of the app mentions.  Oh, boy.  Hey, I'm not a fan of that.  I just DM people back if they're nice to me.  I write them a nice little DM.  Like, thanks a lot.  Yeah.  Brah.  Thanks, brah.  Every once in a while, I'll fucking do it publicly, but I don't know.  It just clutters your timeline, right?  Yeah.  Although the people like seeing their name up there.  They certainly do.  What do you got?  The NFL starts for the other 30 teams tomorrow.  I'm rooting for the Jet versus Giants Super Bowl. 
[00:50:30]  Yuck.  That's a tweet?  I would be bored to think that.  That's from September.  But he doesn't tweet anything, then.  Wait, what are you talking about?  You just read a tweet that's, like, over a year old.  All the rest of them are app mentions.  Did he retweet that or something?  You just go to his profile.  He's just got five tweets from yesterday.  Maybe this, maybe official Regis is the wrong Regis.  Oh, that's not the fool Regis.  Sam. 
[00:51:00]  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Fucking.  What a fool.  Queer.  Just Regis.  Oh, just.  Tom slash Regis.  Oh, you got Regis.  Oh, you got the Regis.  There's so many fake Regis film-ins.  Yeah.  All right, there it is.  Yeah, there it is.  Look, it's a picture.  I took a selfie.  All right, what's his last five tweets?  First one.  Vote for Regis.  Is that okay?  What does that mean?  I don't know. 
[00:51:30]  Here's my first selfie.  Hashtag, I'm also on Twitter.  At Justin Tuck.  Ugh.  Oh, boy.  Ugh.  I'm of the Lodge.  Black gentleman.  Oh, here's this one.  I'm going home and watching the New York Knicks.  Now leave me alone.  Love you all.  Good night.  That's wonderful.  How many followers do you have, pal?  16,000 right now.  That's it.  But he just got on the Twitter.  Jimmy Kimmel tweeted that he was on.  I forget. 
[00:52:00]  He's in a blow-up now.  Just started the Twitter.  The Twitter.  And I'm hearing from Kathy L. Gifford.  And I'm hearing from Kathy L. Gifford.  William Shatner.  Where are all my friends?  Real Donald Trump.  You out there?  Oh, my God.  Old people with technology.  Oh, my God.  He always has sucked.  I don't know how to work this computer, Gellman.  Come out and help me.  And then the newest one.  At Jimmy Kimmel. 
[00:52:30]  Are you trying to start trouble?  You saw what I did to Letterman.  At Late Show.  You're next.  Yeah, maybe I don't have to follow that.  He's trying to get his retweets from his famous friends and get some followers.  Yes, get some heat.  He wants a little Twitter heat.  Why don't you just tweet crazy shit and then people talk about it?  True.  And then tweet racist stuff.  Like his cock.  Yeah.  Cock pics.  New co-host.  That's what we fought for. 
[00:53:00]  Remember this guy.  That is all the time we have for this Saturday night.  Saturday Night Live is next with a new one with John Goodman as host.  We'll be back tomorrow after football.  Hope to see you next time.  Let's get the fuck out of here.  Oh, boy.  He's fired.  Yeah.  He's so fired.  Why is he fired?  Oh, boy.  You can't say that.  Yeah, but people make dumb mistakes.  They certainly do.  And it seems like he thought his mic was off at that point.  That's a big FCC violation for the news. 
[00:53:30]  I don't know.  I'm almost not.  Because it's not a politically correct thing they're firing him for.  It's for him doing something in his job that is so dumb.  It was after 10 o'clock, so actually it's not an FCC violation.  Wait a minute.  But that Safe Harbor thing, does that cover the seven dirty words on regular TV?  Yes.  Are you sure?  In decent or profane speech that is broadcast is not actionable between 10 p.m. and 6 a.m.?  I didn't know that.  Okay, I'm still corrected.  And he writes, I'm embarrassed, he said. 
[00:54:00]  I did something extraordinarily unprofessional.  It's something that's drilled into you for a minute.  Oh, I thought you did.  You started this business to always consider the microphones hot.  Yes, hot mic, hot mic, hot mic.  Wow.  I mean, if he's a good dude and the fucking area likes him and shit, why can't you let the guy slide?  He wanted to get the fuck out of there.  Later.  Later.  That was it.  He's done.  He's the fuck out of there.  Poor guy. 
[00:54:30]  And then that leads to the great Conan bit that just shows that the news, they just suck.  There's nothing new going on with local news.  There's just no creativity there.  It's all pre-packaged and lazy.  It's laziness.  It really is.  You think we're lazy.  My God, the local news is extremely lazy.  If you get these little fucking human interest stories that they get off of these, you know,  the wire or a prep burger type site, how about you have a guy that switches it up a little, 
[00:55:00]  reads it, and then, you know, reword it.  How about the newsreader, even?  How tough is it to make it your own a little bit?  Let's make it your own.  But this happens in radio as well, as we have pointed out many times with Jocktober.  Oh, yeah.  There's just a lot of lazy fucking broadcasters out there.  Yeah.  I guess you don't expect them to rewrite every story, but I don't know.  It seems to me they're not rewriting anything. 
[00:55:30]  No.  And this is a prime example.  But Conan, bravo to him, because he has come up with a great bit.  And who said it earlier that Kimmel's got to be fucking pissed?  Yeah, I was saying that.  Because this is like a Kimmel thing.  Yeah, this is right in his little wheelhouse, as they say.  Conan didn't rip off Kimmel, but Kimmel is probably sitting there going, fuck, we should  have thought of this one.  It's a good one.  Yeah.  So here we go.  This is the montage of news clips.  Doing the exact same story. 
[00:56:00]  Exact.  You can admit it if you've bought an item or two or ten for yourself.  Well, it's okay.  You can admit it if you have bought an item or two or maybe ten for yourself.  It's okay.  You can admit it.  You've bought an item or two or ten for yourself.  It's okay.  You can admit it if you've bought an item or two or ten for yourself.  It's okay.  You can admit it if you've bought an item or two or ten for yourself.  It's okay.  you can admit it if you've bought an item or two or ten for yourself. It's okay you can admit it 
[00:56:30]  If you bought an item or two or ten for yourself, it's okay, you can admit it.  If you bought an item or two or ten for yourself, it's okay, you can admit it.  If you bought an item or two or maybe ten for yourself, it's okay.  You can admit it if you bought an item or two or ten for yourself.  It's okay, you can admit it if you bought one or two or maybe three or four, maybe even ten items for yourself.  It's okay, you can admit it if you bought an item or two or ten for yourself.  It's okay. You can admit it if you bought an item or two or ten for yourself. 
[00:57:00]  It's okay. You can admit it if you bought an item or two or ten for yourself.  It's okay. You can admit it if you bought an item or two or maybe ten for yourself.  It's okay. You can admit it if you bought maybe an item or two or ten for yourself.  Is it okay? You can admit it if you bought an item or two or three or ten for yourself.  It's okay. You can admit it if you bought an item or two or ten for yourself.  It's okay. You can admit it if you brought an item or two or ten for you. 
[00:57:30]  It's okay. You can admit it.  If you've bought an item or two or ten for yourself.  It's okay. You can admit it if you bought an item or two or ten for yourself.  It's okay. You can admit it if you bought an item or two or ten. Say for yourself.  It's okay. Admit it if you bought an item or two or ten for yourself.  It's okay, you can admit it if you've bought yourself one or two or ten things for yourself because a lot of people do it. 
[00:58:00]  Wow.  Jesus.  Brilliant bet.  Jesus Christ.  And it's not even, I think, the newscasters, because they just get copies.  No, they're just reading them.  It's the uncreative fucking shit behind the scenes who actually makes the show and puts the news together.  Well, that's funny.  An item or two and then ten.  Oh, let's keep that in there.  They're writing in personalities.  That's a personality thing that you'd say.  Right, right, right.  That's not even the street.  Right, yeah.  There's a little fun thing you'd say.  They're adding that so they seem like their personality.  I like some of them try to work it like, it's okay. 
[00:58:30]  You can admit it.  You can admit it.  I had a bit too hard.  It's ten.  Mike in New Orleans.  Mike.  He has something on this.  What, Mike?  Hey, good morning, guys.  Yeah, Coda's totally ripping this off from Alex Jones.  He's been putting a video out of the exact same thing.  There's another one with the Easter Bunny losing a spring in his step.  And, like, three or four other ones where the news are just all up and reading the exact same thing.  I didn't know Alex did that. 
[00:59:00]  Oh, wow.  So it could have started with Alex Jones.  Yeah, obviously, it's a false flag operation.  The Easter Bunny and the springless step thing is a Conan bit.  Wait, you think maybe Alex Jones thinks it's so cool he's putting it on his website?  Maybe.  Yeah.  Alex Jones probably played the Conan bit.  Oh, Mike.  He's just trying to see how we're all brainwashed by the news.  No, no.  Maybe.  Are you understanding that maybe Conan did it and then Alex put it on his website? 
[00:59:30]  Yeah, because we'll put cool things on our Facebook page, like, check this out.  But that doesn't mean we did it.  Yeah.  Comment?  I definitely saw it.  I just about to...  Sir, you're accusing Conan of ripping off Alex Jones, and it looks like that's not at all what happened.  Right, Alex is just putting it on his website because it's a cool thing that Conan's doing.  It's okay.  You can admit it.  You're wrong, sir.  You made a mistake.  All right.  Thanks, Mikey.  Let's go to Aaron in Atlanta.  Aaron.  How are you?  What's up, fellas?  How are you doing today?  How are you? 
[01:00:00]  We're talking about reporters and anchors fighting on the air.  There's a clip of two old guys.  One's a field reporter interviewing some guy, and the other's the anchor on the other end,  and they're bickering about who does their job better.  Yeah, I think that was from...  That might be local.  Channel 5.  Yeah, I think that's New York.  That's the one I think I was thinking of.  It's a little older, but it's worth a listen.  It's that little gray-haired guy.  Oh, right.  And the bigger guy.  Yeah, there it is.  Right?  Yeah, I talked about one, you know... 
[01:00:30]  Yes!  That was it.  Yes, yes, yes, yes.  All right, let's play this.  This one I absolutely was thinking of.  Yeah, Good Day, New York.  It was from.  Yeah.  The old Good Day, New York.  All right, hit it.  Well, it's been being worked on for many, many, many weeks already, and...  We actually saw this live.  Yeah, I remember seeing this.  How many years ago?  Ten years?  No.  There's a lot that could be done.  Six.  It's done a lot sooner.  I'm here every night.  Well, she lives on the first floor, and so, I mean, I don't see... 
[01:01:00]  I care about my other neighbors.  Well, I mean, so, I mean, it's scheduled.  It's a contracted job.  We don't tell the elevator company when to work their people.  They've submitted a schedule to us.  They said they could do the elevator in six weeks.  So, all we're trying to hold them to is meeting their deadline.  As far as working, doing elevator repairs, 6, 7, 8 o'clock at night, I don't see that  as being a typical process, nor is it a typical process to be working on it. 
[01:01:30]  All right, we've got to go now.  I want to thank you both.  Thank you.  All right, it's back to you, Dan.  All right, don't let it go away.  This, that, that, that's, what, does she have a response to that?  Is she still there?  What's that?  Did the lady just leave?  Yeah.  Oh, that's too bad.  You should, you should have kept that discussion.  She's back if you want her.  Yes.  She heard you.  Yes.  What'd you like to know?  I'd like to know a response to what the gentleman said.  The gentleman's a very effective spokesperson for the, for the company, but obviously,  the people who live there are not satisfied with his explanation. 
[01:02:00]  Right.  So, what do you want now?  Well, if I have to teach you how to be a reporter, Ali, I'll do that later.  I'll have to do that later, Jim.  I think the lady expressed herself, and you're not here, you're there.  Is there any question you'd like me to ask her?  No, I'll give you lessons on how to become a reporter later on.  I'll give you some lessons on how to be an editor, because I was your boss once.  Yeah, you were, and are no longer.  How did that happen?  Good morning, Jim.  We are live.  Oh, wow. 
[01:02:30]  Man, did he slam him.  Wow.  I don't know who's right in that situation, because they seem to hate each other, but the  guy in the studio is wanting to follow up.  Right.  And maybe the other guy is sick of him doing that, but I like the guy in the studio going  like...  You know what?  As a news story, it seemed fine.  I think there was underlying shit going on there.  Yeah.  I think he...  Yeah, there's definitely underlying shit there.  It could have been a little better, but it wasn't anything out of the ordinary.  He seemed like he just had the mic in the guy's face.  He wasn't really asking many questions.  He's just letting the guy ramble and ramble, and then he goes, okay, back to you in the 
[01:03:00]  studio.  It kind of...  He didn't seem like he was very interested in being there.  But you never want to bring up if you used to be somebody's boss.  Oh, I used to be your boss.  Yeah, I used to be.  What happened there?  Oh, that reminded me of Travis and Sal this morning, right?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Like, yeah, well, when I'm not here, it gets brought up.  Nine years I've been here.  How about you?  You used to be a cocksucker, and then they both go, I still am.  Just made that up.  Was that an old guy?  He's not the one that got into it with someone else, is he?  Yeah. 
[01:03:30]  I remember him also getting into it with the younger guy.  Yeah, maybe he's a prick.  He's not the...  But I remember that one as well.  Both those guys are no longer on the news.  He's not that you do a shooter guy.  Oh, no, no, no, no.  A different guy?  Okay.  Those guys were from L.A.  These guys were from New York.  The ones we just heard.  I'll teach you how to be a reporter.  Wow.  The guy's still out in the...  You know why?  He's an old guy, and he's still out in the field like that, fucking holding a mic in front  of people's faces.  Because that's for the young.  Right.  You always see younger guys out on the streets. 
[01:04:00]  Well, that's how you start.  Right.  And then they move you up to, like, a nice, comfy, warm fucking studio.  Yeah.  If you're doing your job problems.  Wait, are we sure that's not the same...  I don't know why he sounds so familiar.  Okay.  I thought that was his voice.  Noted down my mind.  Yeah.  This description says, fat guy with crazy glasses gets owned.  So I guess that kind of sums it up.  I think that's a newer description.  Now, we have one more news thing.  I haven't seen this one, to be honest with you.  News anchor from Raleigh. 
[01:04:30]  Oh.  What is this one about?  Well...  And we're putting a lot of this on our Facebook page, right?  It's on Travis, Facebook, Twitter, and it's O and A Show is the address on Facebook, is  the address on Twitter, is the address on Instagram, is...  O and A Show.  Across the board.  Okay, good.  Well, Facebook is Opie and Anthony.  No, we changed it.  Oh, we did?  Yes.  Oh, good.  Oh, you two want to fight?  They slapped, ooh.  Right?  I've been here for seven years.  Oh, God.  Great.  I'm scared that we changed it.  Teach you to be.  Because Opie and Anthony is very recognizable. 
[01:05:00]  Right, right.  We want to direct everybody to one easy sort of thing across the board.  Does Opie and Anthony redirect you to that?  No, you can only have one username.  That's...  Opie and Anthony, a lot of people who aren't fans might seek it out, or don't listen every  day.  Opie and Anthony is too recognizable.  But it makes it impossible to advertise everything.  What do you mean?  Like, you can't just say, hey, here's where we are.  Then why don't we have Opie and Anthony for everything?  Because we can't get it.  What can't we get it for?  We couldn't get it for Twitter or Instagram.  We could get...  We could get that. 
[01:05:30]  I mean...  I think we got Opie and Anthony again.  You could...  But I mean, that's your work name.  Who has it?  I don't know.  But we're already verified on Twitter, so...  I mean, it doesn't matter.  ONA shows what it is.  That should...  It should be Opie and Anthony.  Yeah.  Only because you and I and the fans know, but people who are casual fans might not be  aware of it.  And that's your work name.  You absolutely own that name.  Whoever has that is fucking sitting on it, and you would...  If Bob would do anything, we could get that.  I believe we got Opie and Anthony back.  We just haven't done anything with it on Twitter, I believe. 
[01:06:00]  Right?  I don't know if we have Opie and Anthony or not.  I know that we've done stuff with ONA's show.  Right.  Oh, boy.  We'll figure it out behind the scenes.  Yes.  Yes.  But the, uh...  What is this now?  Well, this news anchor, who I guess is not going to be a news anchor after this year.  I learned that because I watched the video.  Yes.  Yes.  Put out this...  Instead of doing a Christmas newsletter, he made a YouTube video.  With his family.  This...  I think this is the thing that, like, when black comics goof on white people, it's this. 
[01:06:30]  This guy...  What, did the three of them live together?  His seven million views on this video?  It's huge.  It's unbelievable.  Why?  And you know what's even more...  It's porn.  You know what's even more sickening about this?  Huh?  This is all just promotion because he says in the video that he's leaving the news anchor desk...  To make videos.  To make viral videos for people.  Yeah.  He's being, like, a viral video consultant.  That's it.  And now he's got seven million views on this. 
[01:07:00]  He's got a resume stuffer.  He's going to do just fine.  Something tells me that there are ways to get views for your videos.  Oh, there are.  Mm-hmm.  I know people.  I'm very aware of people who've purchased views.  Oh, boy.  How many views can you purchase?  Why would you purchase views?  Hundreds of thousands.  But it costs money.  It looks better, though.  It probably looks more impressive.  It's a bigger picture.  And for advertising, it probably, like, is, like, wow, this guy gets two million views  per video.  Let's do something with him.  Yeah, but the advertisers have to be aware of that.  And it is...  Why then?  I mean, the advertisers just deal with true clicks, so... 
[01:07:30]  The same reason people buy Twitter followers.  Right.  It's just to increase your profile.  I bought Twitter followers, but I bought nine.  Oh, way too few.  Nine Twitter followers for $10,000.  That's nothing.  Over the top.  Let's retweet me.  Last summer, I got a massive bump up out of nowhere.  I was so excited.  And then they slowly started going away, because I guess Twitter figured it out.  I had nothing to do with it, I swear to you.  And all of a sudden, it would go down $10,000 a day.  Jesus.  I, like, gained, like, $50,000 or $60,000.  Wow.  I was so excited.  Yeah.  I'm like, how did that happen? 
[01:08:00]  And then all of a sudden, I just watched it, you know, dwindle down to where I actually was.  Oh, no.  I was so bummed.  You start trying to figure out why does everybody hate you?  They're leaving you by the thousand?  Yes.  I figured it had to be some kind of fake thing, because, I mean, I had such a ridiculous jump up that I knew that something was up.  But to watch them go away, I was like, oh, man.  But did you ever see, like, you have, like, you know, X amount of followers that will go, hey, 150 people followed you.  But then you're like, well, it's a little less than I had yesterday.  Because I think they weed out a lot of the fake accounts. 
[01:08:30]  So, like, I'll see an increase in a list.  Hey, so many people followed you.  But then I'm losing them.  And it's because people, they're fucking chopping out the fake accounts.  So you'll gain some.  Chopping out the spam accounts or whatever.  Yeah.  And they've had to do that.  But there's so many of them.  Every one of us probably has at least 50% fake followers.  The ones that have zero followers.  And then they've got, like, five tweets.  And it's spam.  It would be in Twitter's best interest to pump up everyone's numbers.  Of course.  Yeah.  Because we're all egomaniacs.  And I mean all of us, including the listeners. 
[01:09:00]  So if Twitter gives you a little extra here and there, it's good for business.  But there's also people who not only will bump up their numbers, but if you're tweeting about them, bump up your numbers.  So it makes the person doing it think.  Look at all the influence that that dude has.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  And then you realize, like, you get, like, whatever, several hundred followers because you tweeted about somebody and they retweeted you.  Right.  But then a week goes by, you lose all of them.  Yeah.  Or you look at the YouTube video and you're like, oh, wow, I got, you know, thousands of views on it. 
[01:09:30]  But they're all for one second.  Oh, really?  Yeah, they're all.  So do you think part of it is if you buy, you buy tweet people or whatever, they actually go and watch the shit that you retweet to just to make your numbers grow?  I think you can pay for a service that, yeah, that you can not only are you buying followers, but you're buying followers that will follow other people and you're buying YouTube views for it.  Because I know people have bought YouTube views for my stuff.  I can see it.  Oh. 
[01:10:00]  They bought YouTube views for your stuff?  Yes.  What do you mean why?  People I'm interviewing have bought YouTube views for those videos so that the numbers go up.  Because I can see that all, like, that video shouldn't have that many that quick.  And all the views, like, the first 50,000.  Oh, so the celebrities are going.  Yes.  This is a cool video.  I'm going to fucking make sure it has more views.  Yes.  Oh, crap.  So just because no celebrity wants to be up there with fucking 2,000 views.  Yeah, that looks silly.  Yes.  A hundred percent.  What dicks.  Let me go to John in Jersey.  John.  Yeah, really? 
[01:10:30]  Let's get a little taste of that.  John.  Yo, what's up, guys?  I know why these guys have 7 million views.  The wife's got huge tits.  The wife is a looker.  Yeah.  I guess.  And the first frame on the video is a side shot of her boobs.  Everybody wants to check out her video.  I still don't know what the fuck this video's about.  So this guy's leaving the anchor desk?  Yeah.  It's basically, you know how people put out Christmas newsletters sometimes?  Right.  Instead of doing a Christmas newsletter to send to everybody, he put out a rap parody video 
[01:11:00]  that's a Christmas newsletter.  It's an update on his family.  But his update is that he's leaving the anchor desk to start a company with his wife and make  viral videos.  And so if you like this, he could do this for your family type of thing.  He doesn't say it, but he, you know.  I wonder how much he charges for a viral video for the Opie Anthony show.  Oh, God.  Will he make us a song?  Yeah.  Oh, a nice rap song.  Oh.  All right, let's see.  It might be worth the money.  But that's what people like this do.  Would you like it?  Oof, no.  Like to convince you so that you'll pay them because companies just want viral. 
[01:11:30]  They don't even know what it means.  Right.  So they'll pay you to make a viral video and then you'll take some of that money and  you'll buy views and followers and stuff so that the company thinks that their shit  just went viral.  But in reality, you just orchestrated the whole thing yourself.  Wow.  That's pretty smart.  But there's got to be a way around that because I would rather lose all the fake followers  and have half of what I have because everybody would be knocked down the same thing.  Like, you know, Katy Perry has $40 million.  Well, she'd have $20 million.  It would all be relative if they got rid of all those fucking fake shit. 
[01:12:00]  I just want a nice, healthy number.  Boney baloney.  I don't care how many are real.  As long as it's a nice, healthy.  That's why I don't block anyone to keep my numbers healthy.  That's good.  It shows integrity.  I just want a healthy number.  Yeah, this is the horrible video.  Let's watch this.  Christmas jammies.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, jeez.  It's a holder and I.  2013 in review. 
[01:12:30]  Video Christmas card part two.  Dancing around the house in Christmas pajamas.  Christmas walk by and this is what they say.  Are those Christmas jammies?  Oh, God.  They are Christmas jammies.  Check it out.  We just bought a Prius V and it matches these perfectly.  Wearing Christmas jammies.  Yeah.  Look at his wife's big tits, though.  Now for Lola, 2013 was full speed ahead.  She now has a medal hanging over her bed because she ran a triangle on and somehow she looked  like she was having fun.  Yeah.  She can count to a hundred in Chinese and she can now read books about as thick as these. 
[01:13:00]  And if you want to pay a visit to Lola's room, you best get ready for a rainbow room.  Looming in the room while shaking your fangs.  She can play the piano and can also sing.  In my Christmas jammies.  Yay.  My jammies fit me just right, but my daddy's here a little tight.  Oh.  She's not a great singer.  No.  Fucking hilarious.  Then Charles, turning four, safe to say he wears superhero shirts every day. 
[01:13:30]  Is he smart in school?  Kind of hard to tell because he just bats his eyes and all the teachers melt.  And in case you didn't see it, well, you should.  It's pretty vital that he dressed up like a chief and shook his hips in a recital.  And now Penn State is...  Do you like this?  I hate this.  This rapping shit.  It's not even that bad, though.  No, but it's like...  It's just there, really.  It's the white guy rapping thing.  I've seen way worse fucking white guys rapping.  I hope he gets sued for stealing the music.  I hope he'll sue them.  Can you imagine the torture of having to go through high school in a few years with this 
[01:14:00]  being on the internet?  Yeah, yeah.  That could be a problem.  But something tells me they live in one of those very nice towns.  Oh, you can tell.  Where they don't have the same problems as other people.  That's true.  There's a lot of bullying happening in those towns.  No, not a lot of diversity.  Oh, yeah.  I mean, no.  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  And his wife is like an aspiring actress.  Yes.  And works for a video company.  And she...  Yeah, she is.  They're struggling.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Video company.  They're in a nice house. 
[01:14:30]  Did you catch that he was sending his young son to a hip-hop class?  Yeah, I saw that.  I'm surprised you guys didn't notice.  I guess there are teachers that are now teaching hip-hop.  Hip-hop.  You know what?  You gotta teach the kid diversity without putting him in one of those neighborhoods, though.  It was the most...  Or surrounding them with any black people.  It was the most lily-white hip-hop class I've ever seen.  That's what I'm saying.  They don't have the same fucking issues.  No.  It's a lot more musical, guys.  Yeah, let's go.  They've got a very easy life.  It was a rap.  Are you uncomfortable? 
[01:15:00]  It was a 1980s fucking rap.  Well, we'll do a parody of Will Smith.  Yes.  This will be great.  He's not as bad as I thought he was going to be, though.  Really?  Yeah.  That's cheeseball shit, though.  Total cheeseball shit.  Let's go to Dennis in Wisconsin.  Dennis?  Yeah.  Just telling Sam that he's an idiot and it's still the O.B. and Anthony show on Facebook.  It's not the O.N.A. show.  I just looked on my phone as I was driving here.  Ooh.  I mean, I changed it myself.  It's the O.N.A. show on Facebook.  Yeah, but the guy, I agree with the guy's the nation. 
[01:15:30]  Did you just post about all the news media people on there and it still comes up as the  O.B. and Anthony show?  I bet it's not.  Yeah, I don't think so.  If you type in O.B. and Anthony show, the page is going to come up, but the direct link  is O.N.A. show.  Look.  Facebook.com slash O.N.A. show.  Whatever.  Right?  Let's not complicate things.  If you search O.B. and Anthony, you're going to find it, of course.  Oh, nice.  Sweet.  But if you search O.N.A. show, it doesn't come up.  It comes up as the O.B. and Anthony show. 
[01:16:00]  Oh, boy.  Right?  Yeah, he's right, though.  The guy's right.  You're right.  No, I'm not.  Yeah, see?  He's absolutely right.  Thank you.  See, you tried it and the guy's absolutely right.  You're right, sir.  You're absolutely right.  You're right, sir.  I just want to let you know.  All right.  Thank you, buddy.  They didn't switch it right.  Very helpful.  Call it right there.  Yep.  Immensely.  All right.  Let's go back to this.  And by the way, that's why we want one thing across the board, because idiots like that guy.  That's right.  Idiot.  And now Penn's taking a hip-hop class.  That musical ability is growing fast. 
[01:16:30]  Kick it.  Christmas.  Yummy.  That kid's not good either.  Yes, he is.  We know that you're ridiculous.  That's why no one will dance with us.  Look at those tits.  He's five.  No.  The mother.  Yeah, his wife's a piece of ass.  Look at that Christmas jammy.  Hashtag Christmas jammy.  What a year for Kim.  Ever started, she met him.  Got a part in Iron Man 3. 
[01:17:00]  And then she spent a whole day with RDJ.  And the result right there.  That's me.  Even tougher to beat was her fitness feat.  The Raleigh Iron Man 70.3.  Even though she got punched in the face near the start of the race, she still finished in 640.  Rolling in the car, going 25.  And pushing the scroller up north.  Yeah.  These are Christmas jammies.  Look at my Christmas jammies.  Okay, shut up.  Yay, fuck Christmas jammies.  Shut up.  It's just there.  Give me, give me. 
[01:17:30]  What?  What happened with Anne on this one?  It's so angry.  Why is it angry?  No, it's not.  Because it's just so, like, it is cringy and it's nice and it's like, what, they're friendly,  happy family.  They make shirts for themselves.  Yeah.  Dad, mom.  Just a very nice family with no problems.  Exactly.  Nobody wants to see that.  Just having some fun.  Some good, clean fun.  Who gives a fuck?  I hope at night he just punches her in the face.  I'm sure there's just shitty undertones to everything in their life.  Skeletons in the closet. 
[01:18:00]  I hope, I'll tell you what I hope, is that they get sued for the Iron Man 3 clip they  used.  Yes.  I want him to be tied up in litigation until 2017.  He wants him sued.  Definitely.  He's just, he's just thumbing through it looking for a copyright violation.  All right, we're done?  No.  Christmas jammies.  You wouldn't wear them?  No.  And let's be honest, the kids are not strong singers.  No.  They're not good.  Like little songbirds.  It's room for a child, number three, but I can't, I just had a vasectomy. 
[01:18:30]  I got BD.  That's the one good part, that he does say now he can blow loads in his wife, no problem.  Yeah, I got a vasectomy, basically.  All he has to do now is complain how she won't take the cum in her asshole.  I have to get snipped because she shits when I put it in her shitter.  All of a sudden, the song goes off the rails.  Who puts that in their Christmas YouTube update?  Sometime the kids will say, Mommy, why are you crying?  And she'll be bleeding from the back into her Christmas jammies. 
[01:19:00]  Yes.  Would you like the song?  Yes, I would like that.  Just took a vile direction?  A vile direction about blood in her Christmas jammies.  Blood and shit in the Christmas jammies?  She's got a pretty rockin' body there, though, doesn't she?  And he's hittin' it raw.  No fuckin' bulge in Dad's fuckin' Christmas jammies, though.  How depressing is that?  It's still an Eddie Murphy concept from 1980.  Let's go.  Would you add, if you had a vasectomy, would you put that in your Christmas story?  Fuck it, I'd open and close with us.  They're just having a little fun, Sam. 
[01:19:30]  A little fun.  A little fun?  A little fun.  They're okay with it.  I can shoot deep right in her womb.  We won't have to repaint another room?  He's Christmas jammies.  Well, I think that maybe we should end with a multiple choice of what happened to Penn.  Did he A, run the same race as me?  B, have a tiny role in Iron Man 3?  I mean, like, tiny.  The role was so small.  Like his dick. 
[01:20:00]  Short.  It was just, I mean, you cannot blink.  C, quiz the governor about his first term.  D, cut his knee while doing the worm.  E, take up CrossFit and fall in love.  Well, the answer is F, all of the above.  But the biggest thing is what happens next, next month.  He's dancing crazy.  Anchor desk, it's the biggest decision of his life.  He's going to quit his job and come work with his wife.  We'll be making videos just like these for politicians and companies.  And we'll do it in these jammies.  In these Christmas jammies. 
[01:20:30]  He is hoping that all goes well, but what will I do with all this gel?  Presents for our neighbor.  He's giving up a good jig.  In the Christmas jammies.  What's the matter with this guy?  We love you all.  Visit thegreenroom.com for more questions.  I just want it to fail, and I want them to lose their house.  I want nothing more.  Yes.  Complete business failure.  We got tied up in litigation.  I wish something rhymed with that.  We got a guy that knows this guy. 
[01:21:00]  Oh, great.  He works for the station that this guy's leading.  Joe.  I wish it was the Grim Reaper on the phone.  What do you say, Joe?  Hey.  Hey, Hope.  How you doing?  All right, buddy.  I don't actually know the guy.  I used to work at that station.  I don't know, but that station's a distant number three in the ratings.  Back when I worked there, we used to get beat by reruns of Springer, and they haven't got  any better.  So him leaving for doing viral videos is probably a step up.  Oh, wow.  Thank God for that.  We'll probably see him in this video when they have the whole time he's been at this station. 
[01:21:30]  Someone's a little catty.  What a bummer, man.  Hitting this guy while he's down, man.  Jeez.  You think his kids know that he just completely whored them out for his commercial?  Yeah.  Yeah, I'm sure they're excited about it.  No, they're all, they think it's a lot of fun.  Is that how it ends?  Yeah, he's doing his little flood sands.  You know, I've always wanted my own internet.  That got a flop.  Let's try this one more time, okay?  A little outtake?  What is this?  I'll need them? 
[01:22:00]  Yeah.  That's whatever.  It's done.  Let's go to John in Virginia.  John.  Hey, guys.  The reason this made 7 million views is it was on the national news, NBC, the other night.  Yeah, once it gets national coverage.  Well, it's one of their own.  It's an anchor.  It's an anchor.  It's an anchor, yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Well, you guys have a great day now.  You too, John.  Oh, creep.  Yeah, whatever.  All right, we're going to take a little break.  Christmas jammies.  In our Christmas jammies.  You never got Christmas jammies? 
[01:22:30]  Oh, God.  If I did, I certainly didn't put them on YouTube.  But it's a stupid song.  You didn't like that, Ant?  No, it was too nice.  It made me angry.  It's right.  Happy family.  No.  It was way too nice for Anthony.  No, I like nice.  I don't mind nice.  I wasn't bothered by it.  It wasn't great.  I was bothered by it.  It wasn't great or anything.  It wasn't real nice.  It's a fucking commercial.  It's fake nice.  Ah, you can tell it's a loving family.  Oh, God.  I think that's what it bothers me a little bit, too. 
[01:23:00]  No, I just...  Well, Anthony's like, what's wrong with their faces?  Because there's smiles on them.  No, it's the rap thing.  You should appreciate them, because they couldn't be whiter, this family.  Yeah, but it's embarrassing.  Oh, you're mad about the rap.  I think it's like if some successful black gentleman is watching some black guy shucking  and jiving with a bucket of chicken or something, he'll be like, oh, that's fucking embarrassing.  That, to me, is embarrassing as a white person.  Oh, I didn't know.  Because they're abandoning the race. 
[01:23:30]  Exactly.  That's a problem.  Rapping.  I'm not going to sleep over that.  It was whatever.  Well, I'll sleep fine, but it's annoying to watch.  I wouldn't call it sleep when he's face down with your clothes still on.  All right, ready?  I'm hanging on the show with my friend Ant and Greg.  We all of a sudden start to eat eggs.  We put them down and talk into the mic.  Because you know we don't like to fuck the dyke. 
[01:24:00]  We like pussy.  And it's got to be jimsy.  Don't laugh at me, Anthony, while I'm on the mic.  You might not know how to fuck a dyke.  I'll say it twice.  You don't give a shit.  Opie has a smile that makes you go, wow.  Anthony has hair that makes you go, he.  Opie has a smile that makes you go, wow.  Anthony has a cock that makes me go, dude.  Fuck you.  You know when that dog you had is a fucking mutt.  Opie had the right moves because his steak was on the floor.  And his potatoes weren't there no more.  So he killed that motherfucker, rough, rough, rough. 
[01:24:30]  But you know what?  It wasn't that guff.  Look it up in the dictionary if you don't know what I mean.  Because I don't have time to show you the team of the A's.  The Rampage Jackson.  You know I'm a fraction of what I should have been a long time ago.  But I'll keep rapping.  You don't hate this.  You don't even know.  I'll throw it in right in the middle.  I'm so fucking, wow, I eat Skittles.  Ah, yeah.  Opie has a smile that makes you go, wow.  Anthony has hair that makes you go, he.  Opie has a smile that makes you go, wow. 
[01:25:00]  Anthony has a cock that makes me go, dude.  I'm not done.  Fuck that.  I'll make it jack.  And then I'll look back on the guy with the heart attack that saw Sasquatch in the woods.  All of a sudden, he has the word coulds in his fucking mouth.  Because he had a gun made of a stick.  All of a sudden, you had to pick.  Did you know him?  Did you know her?  Or did you like it?  White girls like me.  Black girls like me.  Girls adore me.  Even the ones that even saw me know.  I ain't rhyme with a fucking show.  Why?  I don't know.  I'll steal a fucking rap from a hoe. 
[01:25:30]  I don't give a shit.  I'll move on.  Push another button.  I'll flow with it.  You don't even got no fucking show without it.  Yo, I'm Bob Kelly.  I'm a rapping genius.  Opie has a smile that makes you go, wow.  Anthony has hair that makes you go, he.  Opie has a smile that makes you go, wow.  Anthony has a cock that makes me go, dude.  The Opie has a smile that makes you go, man.  The Opie and Anthony show continues in moments.  And now, these messages. 
[01:26:00]  Who is this?  Uh, S-T-P.  Who?  S-T-P.  Beyonce's album not being sold at Target?  Oh, my God.  Or Walmart.  It's usually Walmart that does this shit.  But this time it's Target.  Walmart does it for, like, moral reasons.  You know, to sexual or, you know, gay or something. 
[01:26:30]  But they don't like that shit.  But the people have spoken.  Yeah.  And in a lot of cases, the people have spoken.  And then Walmart still does their morality shit.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  If it's selling a lot of copies, that means the people want it.  And you should fucking offer it to your customers.  Well, Target has a new tack on this whole thing.  They don't want to carry it because she released it on iTunes.  iTunes, right.  iTunes first.  And I guess that's going to cut back on the albums that Target would be able to sell. 
[01:27:00]  Because people already have it through iTunes.  Right.  So they're like, well, fuck you.  I think they're trying to, what, strong arm?  Yeah.  It's not going to work.  They see the future and they're petrified.  They're trying to scare other artists.  Because it's not going to make a fucking lick of a difference with Beyonce.  She's sold almost 900,000 copies, right?  Yeah.  That's crazy.  Did you do research on the squirting song yet?  I don't know if anybody is saying that she's talking about squirting.  Yeah, there's a song where she's singing about squirting. 
[01:27:30]  I think it's very obvious to the people.  I haven't heard about that.  Are you sure of the people?  All the people, yeah.  Yep.  How great is it that they fucking lost that battle, though?  Because, by the way, there's no overhead on iTunes at all.  No shipping.  No fucking, nothing.  You just downloaded.  I mean, it's, what dummy's Target is?  Well, same thing the record stores did before they collapsed their, you know.  Trying to hang on.  They're trying to hang on.  But there's this easier way to get our shit. 
[01:28:00]  I'm sorry.  The future's here.  But there is.  So there's old videos of what the house of the future was supposed to be like back in  the 50s.  And they have, like, home shopping.  They do.  It's this big television set and buttons and stuff.  But it was pretty much, look at the screen.  And they show this housewife kind of looking at the screen.  And she sees, like, clothing.  Right.  And she could order it right there.  And it'll come out of the husband's bank account.  Like, yeah.  Oh, they set it that way, too?  Yeah, yeah.  They place it like that. 
[01:28:30]  But it's absolutely what happened.  Is this the video?  I think that might be it.  No credit cards back then, though, right?  They didn't foresee credit cards?  Or they did?  I think they did, yeah.  Like, or to credit certain things.  Is that the house of the future?  Mm-hmm.  In Tomorrowland, an exciting, dramatic exterior.  But would people really be interested in it?  Oh.  Here's just a part of the answer.  What's inside?  Five to ten thousand people a day who wanted to get an idea of what a home in the future might be. 
[01:29:00]  Monsanto.  They're white people.  Yeah.  Winch suits.  Look at them all.  Dumb kid.  The house looks stupid.  Like a spaceship.  You see these in the woods every once in a while.  It looks like a UFO.  Right.  Oh.  They're inside the house of the future now, looking around.  All glass.  The glass stuff is true.  Yeah, yeah.  A lot of glass.  A lot of windows.  The, uh, what's that?  The modern kitchen.  I don't see much difference. 
[01:29:30]  She loves cooking so much.  She's hugging parts of the kitchen.  What a dream.  Imagine how wonderful it would be to live in a house like this.  Oh.  Just imagine.  I'd be getting dinner in this kitchen.  The futuristic house next door to me was sold.  And what a kitchen.  If you want more light, press a button.  Any intensity of light through polarized plastic ceiling panels.  Oh.  Soft light, shadowless light.  Mm-hmm. 
[01:30:00]  Right.  A dishwasher, of course.  What?  But this one, unlike any other.  What happens?  Washing is by ultrasonic waves.  What?  Right.  And the dishwasher is also the storage place for dishes.  That's silly.  That's usually what it is.  My house, anyway.  Living here could be fun.  Even to setting the table.  Why?  Why is that fun?  What's fun about that?  Looks exactly like it does in the 50s.  Yeah.  What's happening here?  Oh.  In an ordinary house, we'd be talking about the refrigerator and freezer.  What's this?  This house of the future, we call them cold zones. 
[01:30:30]  Cold zones.  That's what she's got between her legs.  One zone for regular refrigeration.  Nobody's got drawers anymore in the future.  Everything lowers down.  Or raises.  None of this is accurate.  No.  This didn't happen.  This didn't happen.  No.  I love the future.  It's fun.  All right.  She's taking out stuff to cook, I guess.  I like the fact that the wife's just in the kitchen. 
[01:31:00]  I like that.  She's got the apron on.  Yeah.  The strawberry on it.  More stuff coming down on it.  It looks dangerous, too.  A place for everything and at your fingertips.  And it would stop working.  The mechanics would stop working.  Of course it would.  And they didn't foresee lawsuits when one kid gets their fucking finger caught in the door.  Right.  Yeah.  Oh, there she goes.  She just pulled a big pot out of the...  Yes, this kitchen almost gets dinner itself.  But that wouldn't really be fun.  No, we still need the hole for that.  The fun is making the most of the ultimate in kitchen convenience...  When you're done rattling those pots and pans, get in the bedroom. 
[01:31:30]  Look at all the button pushing you have to do.  So many fucks.  The range is different, too.  What?  Oh, here.  What?  The rising.  Rising and lowering.  That's what the future...  Everything done just right at amazing speed.  It's microwave.  Microwave.  Microwave.  Cooking with microwaves?  That's crazy.  Here is a complete climate control operated by this panel in the kitchen.  Oh.  That's...  We kind of have that.  Ventilation. 
[01:32:00]  Yeah.  And even the scent of roses or...  We don't have that.  No.  No.  Life puts her asshole by the vent.  Unusual, too, are the floors.  What?  A vinyl plastic with a plastic foam underlay that...  Clean in a jiffy.  Tough, yet beautiful.  Right.  Is everything a plastic?  Almost.  Yes.  Dishes, cups, countertops...  Except this phallus, which is made of glass, and the wife hides in her anus until the husband  leaves.  Plastics in all their colorful, functional...  They loved plastic back then. 
[01:32:30]  That was a futuristic idea.  Oh, yeah.  Have stepped it years ahead.  Yes.  This is not a very impressive house.  No.  No.  The wife's just spending way too much time in the kitchen.  What about the rest of the house?  Exactly.  You don't need to guess whose room this is.  What?  That's right.  For the young man of the house.  Oh.  Oh.  Here's the answer to the continuous activity of the younger...  It's just a drawer's dresser.  Durable materials.  Easily washable.  Floors, walls, snowing, and burning.  Yes.  That's right.  The sheets that shock him when pre-cum leaks. 
[01:33:00]  What a shitty bed.  Tiny.  Everything is fiberglass and plastic and polyester.  Everything was wool back then, so...  Yeah.  And for the young lady of the house, just look around.  Oh, wow.  Just look around.  It's like a sliding door that used to separate the gym.  An accordion door.  Yeah, accordion door.  And that's where...  Yes.  And the mother's brushing the daughter's hair in a regular-looking bedroom.  Yeah.  This isn't very futuristic. 
[01:33:30]  The daughter's on the computer looking at shirtless black rap videos.  Maybe that's what it is.  Here's a vanity which even seems fantastic for a dream of the future.  Oh.  A laboratory at one end, melamine surface, and a telephone system which challenges the imagination.  What?  Push buttons instead of dials.  What?  No handset to disturb my lady's dressing.  Just talk and listen.  We have that.  A speakerphone.  They didn't foresee texting.  A speakerphone.  Yeah.  Yes.  And a magician that will come and make her ugly face fuckable. 
[01:34:00]  For the relaxation, a living room that is part of the character of everything we have seen.  Here he goes.  A feeling of space.  Looks like Clockwork Orange.  It's the 1970s thing.  Yes.  Yes.  With your favorite stereophonic recordings.  A snake in the dresser.  High fidelity equipment.  Hi-fi.  It's the big wooden sarcophagus.  Yeah.  Holding all the stereo equipment.  They didn't realize how small and digital they didn't see digital coming.  Nope.  Any flat screens? 
[01:34:30]  Nope.  Just plastics.  All plastics.  A lot of plastic.  Yes.  Oh, the bathroom.  The sinks raising up from the floor.  That's not affordable.  That's not a good business model.  No stretching or bending from the sink?  It's an electrical outlet right by it so the little cunt can put her finger in.  For the grown-ups, another bathroom completely molded in two pieces with features that seem  pure fantasy. 
[01:35:00]  What?  Built-in electric razor and electric toothbrush.  What?  That's fantasy?  And here's something we'd all like to have.  That's cool.  The same push-button phone we saw on the dressing table, but with the added attraction of a closed-circuit  television.  Wow.  All right.  How old does this look now, though?  Crazy.  Well, that's of whoever is standing at your front door.  Can you pause for one second?  Because what they did, they had that right?  But it's like, imagine if they had said, and a piece of glass that you could hold up  and show your genitals to somebody in another country. 
[01:35:30]  Look, you can go, you can pretend you're someone else and send out hateful messages to  everyone.  But this stuff looks like fucking 30 years ago now.  It's, what year was this, like 1958, maybe?  This is definitely 50s.  Yeah, 50s.  So they've got to figure it out.  A lot of it, yeah.  Except for fucking raising and lowering of everything.  Enough with that shit.  We didn't have, everything doesn't move in your house.  You don't need everything raising from the floor and lowering from your cabinets. 
[01:36:00]  Imagine the electric.  And it's sliding from the left to the right.  Yeah.  Yeah, power goes out and you can't access anything.  Right.  Like, the only reason you'd have shit like that is to save space, but then you can't put  anything on it because it raises and lowers.  And you can't put anything in anything because everything's taken up by the stuff that gets  raised.  Yes, exactly.  And they saw it.  But they just didn't see anything digital or anything portable.  No, no.  They forgot to see that things will get smaller and the technology end of it. 
[01:36:30]  But they're looking with technology of the time.  What could happen.  Making a, yeah, yeah.  I love the fucking.  Using what they have already.  What they have.  Right.  Yeah.  The portable, the speakerphone is pretty cool though.  But back in 50 years ago, if you're like, oh my God, I'll have to hold it to my head.  Right.  With the buttons too.  It's like, no, there won't be buttons.  It's a touch screen.  A piece of glass that you'll talk into.  What?  And you'll call Bob Kelly a fat idiot.  And then you'll realize he was right all along.  Let's get to the end of this.  Oh, yeah.  Give him any message you want over the two-way communication system. 
[01:37:00]  Two-way.  Adjustable, shadowless ceiling lighting, of course.  Look at how tiny the screen is on that.  Yes.  The bathroom of the future in the house of the future.  That's right.  Takes the stink right out.  The versatility of plastics comes sharply to the front in the master bedroom.  Oh, where the magic happens.  This will hold your wife's legs open.  In case she's not comfortable for you.  I'm not comfortable.  You can blacken her eye with plastic.  Yeah.  Cover her mouth so she doesn't scream and shit on your dick. 
[01:37:30]  Oh, that bed looks horrible.  Oh, it's uncomfortable.  It was made of plastic.  Yeah, it's all plastic.  Oh.  One last look through the thermal pane windows.  Okay.  Decorative plastic laminated safety glass.  Plastic.  Functional.  Beautiful.  Another dream of the future.  That's almost like the see-through wall.  Yeah.  Oh, it would be wonderful.  Oh.  She's still fantasizing.  Someday.  Someday.  Nope.  You won't live to see it. 
[01:38:00]  You're dead.  You're dead.  Yeah.  You hag.  You're a challenging new experience.  Wow.  To stimulate your imagination toward newer and better ways.  That kid is probably 65 now.  Oh, God.  Oh, that depresses Jimmy.  I forgot.  Yeah.  That's amazing.  Her whole life is over.  Monsanto.  Radiating your food.  When you take the rats.  An idea of some of the elements.  Half of the house is just less.  It's like cheese.  Yeah.  It's a big thing of cheese with a quarter gun. 
[01:38:30]  That's a 1971 clockwork arms suit.  Yeah.  That wasn't the one I meant, but that was fun.  All right.  Well.  But it's like they just found out about plastic and then built a house.  Yeah, yeah.  They don't have any actual.  Let's build it out of plastics.  Insight into technology.  They're just like, plastic.  Yeah.  There's no real vision there.  No, they just love plastic.  Right.  And they didn't realize things like the stove and the fridge won't need to be changed.  No.  Those are fine.  They work.  They're okay with that.  You'll update them.  They'll save energy better. 
[01:39:00]  A cold zone.  Yeah, they'll have more room, maybe, organized a little better.  But yeah, we still have a fucking box that's cold inside and you put food in it.  That's it.  That's a huge.  That doesn't need improvement.  No.  We've only had that for maybe, what, 80 or 100 years?  Yeah.  We didn't have that for the first four billion.  Everything was fucking warm.  Yeah, yeah.  The refrigerator's fine.  It's a great invention.  Don't worry about it.  An amazing invention. 
[01:39:30]  But they didn't see things like the internet.  No.  Like, that was, you couldn't predict that there would be this...  Wi-Fi.  Yeah.  This universal kind of...  IP delivery.  Yeah.  Dan Adam has a funny joke about that, about Star Trek not seeing the internet coming.  Yeah, yeah.  How they see everything, but just that was one that everybody missed.  Just missed out.  Yeah.  Their computer system, though, and their tricorder system on Star Trek, they had all their info  on it.  Like, Spock was always able to get, like, oh, back in the history of, like, he was able 
[01:40:00]  to look shit up on his tricorder.  That's kind of like your phone.  What's the top five greatest inventions in our lifetime?  Holy fuckaroni.  Plastic, number one.  Fuck plastic.  Our lifetimes.  In our lifetime.  On his, yeah.  Wow.  Oh, yes.  Wheel.  Fire.  Definitely the internet's number one.  Gotta go internet number one.  I think you gotta throw microwave in the top five.  That's...  That's our lifetime.  That's pretty old.  That was fucking World War II.  They were already microwaving in World War II?  Yeah, microwave's pretty old. 
[01:40:30]  Really?  It was very efficient.  Why the fuck didn't we have a microwave growing up?  Fucking old.  The cell phone?  Yeah.  Wait, how old's the microwave?  I'm blown away by this.  How old's that microwave?  Where people were buying it in droves, not just, like, the fucking...  Oh, I don't think until the 70s they really started.  That's what I'm saying, then.  I mean, the theory behind it was, like, in the 30s.  Yeah.  Maybe we shouldn't go with inventions, then.  Just things that came about in our lifetime.  Things that I think you're fucking, you know, the smartphone.  Your fucking...  Smartphone, internet, microwave. 
[01:41:00]  I'm sticking with my microwave.  I love that microwave.  What else?  Amazing invention.  I mean, it's hard to say with medicine.  Cars are fucking lame as could be, still.  Houses, in general, lame as could be.  TVs, eh.  Maybe the fucking...  The artificial heart, maybe?  The stent?  Oh.  What if he had fun little things?  Yeah, that's fun.  Yeah, I don't know.  You know, just the... 
[01:41:30]  You could really go into it and, you know, the microprocessor.  Yeah, like that Dr. Anne Wang, I think, right, was the guy who came up with that.  Cell phone, though.  Yeah, cell phone was...  Being able to leave your house and you could still communicate to whoever the fuck you want.  That's pretty amazing.  Yeah.  And they could get a hold of you.  Yeah, yeah, yeah, huge.  I can't even wrap my head around it that for most of our lifetimes, we left our house and  you were just in the Wild West hoping you could find your friends and stuff. 
[01:42:00]  Doesn't it seem so isolating to not think of your phone in your life?  Like, there's no cells?  It's hard to remember it at this point.  Because you really had to fucking be good.  Like, you had to figure it out all during the day.  Like, all right, so 5 o'clock you're going to be there, right?  Okay, and then from there we're going to go over to this joint.  Yeah, and if you needed to make a call, you went to a pay phone.  You had to find a pay phone.  But then the person you're calling had to actually be at home.  No answering machine.  Instead of texting them, like, if they're busy, they still go, oh, you're trying to get a hold 
[01:42:30]  of me.  But you forget you had to match up.  Like, if you wanted to talk to someone, they had to be in the spot you were calling.  Right.  That's craziness.  That's absolute craziness.  I almost can't remember life without it, too.  I'm having a tough time.  Do you find in movies, I'll watch a movie from, like, 88, and I'll go, they didn't  have cell phones?  No matter how modern the movie looks, I was watching Crazy People yesterday with Dudley  Moore, where he plays the advertising executive, and all the maniacs make, he puts all these  sarcastic, shitty ads, but they were, it's really a pretty funny movie, some of the ads 
[01:43:00]  are hilarious.  And Paul Reiser's really young in it.  And I'm like, they didn't have cell phones.  Yeah.  Like, I don't know why that seems so ancient to me, the 80s.  It's so odd.  Yeah, because it's very hard to think now, not having it.  Like, I actually had to show a girl my dick.  Oh, man.  I was mostly just texting her a fucking doctored photo.  Remember calling a girl, though, and, like, she wasn't there, and you would keep trying,  and then all of a sudden she would finally pick up her.  You'd have to jerk off with her dad on the phone when she got home. 
[01:43:30]  Now you got this, you know.  Remote control is the best invention.  That's the main one.  That is.  That's from Eric Nagel.  Oh.  iPod's a big one.  That's all the kind I used with the phones, though.  Yeah, man.  Digital in general, obviously.  Digital photos.  Satellite TV's coming in, I guess.  Cable.  Cable is pretty huge.  I was thinking about that this morning.  That's pretty odd.  I was remembering the little cable truck that used to drive around, like an ice cream truck.  It would come around your neighborhood, and they would kind of do these little things. 
[01:44:00]  They'd survey the people, see if they wanted it.  So they could bury the lines and shit.  Oh, right.  And they'd show you what it was all about.  You'd go into this big truck, and they'd have a display of what cable TV was like.  And it's like, ooh, this is amazing.  Ooh.  Yeah.  You used to drive around, and every house had the big fucking antenna on it.  There was a fucking antenna on everyone's roof.  Rick in Indiana.  GPS.  All right.  That is. 
[01:44:30]  Remember the fucking maps?  One of the biggest fucking events.  You had to pay attention the entire time, or you were going to miss your street.  Yes.  GPS is huge.  Now you just punch that address in.  You don't even realize you're driving after time.  You don't even have to.  You're like, where am I?  You don't even know where you are.  Yeah.  You don't even have to.  GPS.  GPS is huge.  Right there.  That could be.  It's so much easier to get around.  Remember, you would find some shitty map, and you'd have to turn it to D6.  Where's D6 on this thing?  All right. 
[01:45:00]  Okay.  Where's that road?  But I'm not in D6 yet.  I'm still in the D6.  The Hangstrom maps.  Right.  I still.  I'm such a fucking jizz.  I have one in my trunk, and I just won't throw it out, because you never know.  I mean, it probably is going to have.  What do you mean?  Just in case someone sets off an EMP.  Right.  You'll fucking be able to still get somewhere.  I like to have my fucking map.  I may have to go on Route 80 one time for fucking three cities.  Yeah.  Just ask someone.  I know.  Pull into a gas station.  They love when you ask for directions.  A circle in a red pen where the police tell you the black ice is on the map. 
[01:45:30]  You know, it's funny.  But my black ice, somebody mocked me, called me a queer.  Yes, we did.  Yes, she did.  Bag of shit.  Not to your face.  I know, but I sensed it.  My asshole itches when people are talking about me.  Either I have a roid that needs popping.  This guy wants to remind us of something.  Disgusting.  Filthy.  Dave in Wisconsin.  Dave.  Oh.  Boys.  Hi, Dave.  Well, how about when Danny Glover had that suitcase telephone in Lethal Weapon?  Yeah.  Yeah, that movie seems relatively modern anyway, right? 
[01:46:00]  I remember it.  Right.  That movie's got to be how many years old now?  I'm going to say 86, maybe?  Yeah, that was 80s.  Or I thought.  87.  87.  So that's 26 years ago.  Or Wall Street, the famous Gordon Gekko phone.  Yeah, that phone.  There's ads for Radio Shack and cell phones and stuff from the 80s where you see people  carrying a little suitcase thing with a cord and a phone and they're like, hey, look,  I'm free. 
[01:46:30]  I could do this anywhere.  But, you know, just turning around.  Someone might have a good bit here.  Carl in Westchester.  Go ahead, Carl.  There are some relatively modern movies that would be over in 10 minutes if they had cell  phones.  I was watching After Hours the other night.  That Scorsese film?  Yeah.  The whole thing.  The guy's running around the city looking for a pay phone, can't find one.  People are chasing him.  It's over in 10 minutes.  He grabs his phone and just says, you know, what's up?  Yeah, there are a lot of movies that kind of fall apart with the cell phone. 
[01:47:00]  I'm trying to think of another movie that would fall apart if the cell phone was.  Technology, right, or cell phones.  You got another one?  You know, most episodes of Three's Company.  Well, they were always in a jam, weren't they?  Oh, yeah, that's right, Chris.  You would say, look, he fell behind the cell phone.  Can you get over here?  No, it's like, uh, Terry could text him.  No, no, no.  He's not a mental patient.  He's the doctor.  Right.  They would always get mixed up, wouldn't they?  Oh, boy.  All right, punch you out, guys.  All right.  You punch yourself.  What's the problem here? 
[01:47:30]  Court gathering.  Hold on.  Yeah, just a little bit.  Um, it looks like there's going to be at least 200 people there and, uh, missing Christmas carols out on the street.  I think that's your response, which is great.  So the people who wrote this letter have not come forward.  How do you feel about that?  Of course not.  Oh.  No, we think they're cowards.  I wish they would.  I wish they'd even want to come to us.  The neighborhood hates this one.  You know, explain this to somebody who wrote two big fat pigs.  Yes.  Big fucking fatties.  Do you feel as though it's your, it's your freedom, your right to put up your decorations as you choose on your home? 
[01:48:00]  Absolutely, yeah.  Of course they're going to say yes.  No.  It makes a lot of people happy.  I mean, we just, we don't have any problems.  That's the holidays.  I don't care.  You know, people mind their business.  Criticize for Christmas decorations.  And this is something you just started.  I know that.  I get so much pissed that, yeah.  Well, the decorations are a little shitty, but.  Protecting, protecting your entire town in Cambridge there, Newton, and all over the place.  And, and there.  I don't know, whatever.  Are they lesbos?  They seem a bit lesbo-y.  They look a little lesbo-ish. 
[01:48:30]  Or is it a mother-daughter?  I don't know.  I can't tell.  Are they daughter lesbos?  Yeah.  Big teddy.  The neighbors say it was an eyesore.  Of course they don't let her anonymously.  Oh, stop it.  You know who predicted the internet?  This guy's going to tell us.  Jim in Jersey.  Yes, I did.  Oh.  Yeah.  Good morning.  I, you know, really, the internet was really predicted by George Jetson.  I am.  Jetson's when, when George was talking to Spacely on his television while he was reading the newspaper. 
[01:49:00]  That was way before the internet.  So why didn't we fucking pay attention?  That's just like video phone, though.  Yep.  It's not like internet.  Way before its time.  The other thing was, was in Ferris Bueller's day off, when he's taking the day off and  faking that he's sick, his mom comes in and says, call my office, I'll know where to  find me.  What?  Yeah.  This guy is fucking sick.  Where are you from?  Worstexamples.com?  You're a tard.  Wait, what's the first Bueller one again? 
[01:49:30]  He's panicked.  He's done.  He panicked.  You like being called a tard.  I'm just saying, sir.  Yeah.  Let's say hi to Mark in Virginia.  Mark.  Oh, there's that great scene in Reservoir Dogs where they're talking about tipping and  not tipping, and the whole time is that giant phone that really takes you out of it, sitting  right in the middle of the table.  Can we go to that scene on YouTube there?  Yeah, there's a...  I love that fucking scene.  The giant phone.  Do you remember the giant phone?  I don't.  I don't either.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  I think it's Nice Guy Eddie's. 
[01:50:00]  The scene is amazing, though.  I love that fucking...  Tarantino's genius for dialogue.  But I gotta see the giant phone.  Take care of the chick.  You guys can get the tip.  You get the tip.  Should be about a buck apiece.  I don't tip.  And you, when I come back, I want my book.  Sorry, it's my book now.  Hey, I can't quite lie.  Shoot this piece of shit with me.  All right, everybody cough up some green.  He was great.  Everyone in this scene, it was great. 
[01:50:30]  Shemmy.  Shemmy.  Not wanting to tip.  That was the antenna for the phone that was poking up to the right.  Yep, there it is.  You don't tip?  No, I don't believe in it.  You don't believe in tipping.  Do you know what these chicks make?  They make shit.  Don't give me that.  If you don't make enough money, she can quit.  I don't even know how fucking you would have to bother to say that.  Let me just get this straight.  You don't ever tip, huh?  I don't tip because society says I have to.  All right, I mean, I'll tip if somebody really deserves a tip. 
[01:51:00]  If they really put forth the effort, I'll give them something extra.  But, I mean, it's tipping automatically.  It's for the birds.  I mean, as far as I'm concerned, they're just doing their job.  Hey, this girl was nice.  She was okay.  I mean, she wasn't anything special.  What's special?  Take you in the back and suck your dick.  I'd go over 12% for that.  Hey, look, I ordered coffee, right?  Now, we've been here a long fucking time.  She's only filled my cup three times.  I mean, when I order coffee, I want to fill it six times.  Six times? 
[01:51:30]  Well, you know, what if she's too fucking busy?  What's too fucking busy shouldn't be in a waitress's vocabulary.  Excuse me, Mr. Pink, but the last fucking thing you need is another cup of coffee.  Jesus Christ.  I mean, these ladies aren't starving to death.  They make minimum wage.  You know, I used to work minimum wage, and when I did, I wasn't lucky enough to have a job the society deemed tip worthy.  You don't care?  They're counting on your tips to live.  You know what this is?  It's the world's smallest violin playing just for the waitresses.  You don't have any idea what you're talking about. 
[01:52:00]  These people bust their ass.  This is a hard job.  So is working at McDonald's, but you don't feel the need to tip them, do you?  Why not?  It's just food.  But no, society says, don't tip these guys over here, but tip these guys over here.  That's bullshit.  Waitressing is the number one occupation for female non-college graduates in this country.  It's the one job basically any woman can get and make a living on.  The reason is because of their tips.  Fuck all that. 
[01:52:30]  Jesus Christ.  I mean, I'm very sorry the government taxes their tips.  That's fucked up.  That ain't my fault.  I mean, it would appear that waitresses are one of the many groups the government fucks in the ass on a regular basis.  I mean, if you show me a piece of paper that says the government shouldn't do that, I'll sign it.  Put it to a vote, I'll vote for it.  But what I won't do is play ball.  And it's not college bullshit you're giving me.  I got two words for that.  Learn to fucking type.  They're expecting me to help out with the rent.  You're in for a big fucking surprise.  Let the fuck out of it.  Hey, leave the dollars there. 
[01:53:00]  All right, ramblers, let's get rambling.  Here's the phone.  Yeah, it's huge.  Who didn't throw in?  Mr. Pink.  Mr. Pink.  Why not?  You don't tip.  You don't tip?  What do you mean you don't tip?  You don't believe in it.  Shut up.  What do you mean you don't believe in it?  Come on, you.  Cough up a bucket, cheap bastard.  I paid for your goddamn breakfast.  All right.  Since you pay for the breakfast, I'll put in.  But normally, I would never do this.  Don't mind what you normally would do. 
[01:53:30]  Just cough in your goddamn fuck like everybody else.  Thank you.  Jesus.  But how great is the dialogue of him just saying, no, don't mind normally what you would do.  Like, that's such a true to that guy thing to say.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  It's not a home run line.  No.  We didn't give a fuck about the cell phone.  No.  We all just sat there in amazement at the acting.  Brilliant fucking writing acting.  That was such a great fucking scene.  That's where Tarantino, I think, is the greatest.  I can't think of anyone who's ever done that better. 
[01:54:00]  Yeah.  Writing dialogue that has nothing to do with the story.  With the movie, yeah.  That builds the character a little bit.  Yes.  It keeps you completely interested.  Wow.  Yeah.  Fascinating stuff he talked about.  Yeah.  Yeah, because that was just a basic conversation.  And why would Harvey Keitel, who's basically a fucking absolute murderer and a criminal,  immediately understand Waitressing is the number one fucking thing for women?  He has only this big pro-woman guy.  He knows.  You know?  That's great. 
[01:54:30]  Fucking brilliant.  It's so good, dude.  What do they do in other movies that he's done this year where they have these weird...  Yeah, Pulp Fiction was another one that was just huge with dialogue like that.  Yeah.  In Glorious Bastards, the scene about milk, when Christoph Waltz is talking about fucking...  The opening to that, it's horrifying.  He's talking about milk and how delicious and cold milk is, and the milk looks good.  The Jews are under the floor.  Oh, my God.  I've never seen Jackie Brown.  Waiting to run off with Travis's mom.  Oh, jeez. 
[01:55:00]  Ouch.  Have you seen Jackie Brown?  No.  I've never seen Jackie Brown.  De Niro and Pam.  I've never seen it.  That was pretty good.  I've got to see that one.  Yeah, it was pretty good.  Let's see.  Let's go to Chris in New Orleans.  Chris.  Yeah, I just wanted to say the best example of the no cell phone world was the Chinese restaurant episode of Seinfeld.  Or just scrambling at the pay phones.  Well, yeah, there's a lot of episodes of Seinfeld.  Just any sitcom back then, you know, or show.  Right. 
[01:55:30]  Yeah, you throw a cell phone into the mix in the past.  Wow.  It's going to be a miracle.  You know?  Very good there, Chris.  Thank you.  And then cutting the phone lines in Psycho wouldn't work with cell phones.  All right.  Lassie wouldn't be a show with cell phones.  No, not at all.  Lassie.  Without fucking German pornography, Lassie would be a different show.  The Big Lebowski.  Jay in Canada.  What's up?  Yeah, just thinking about that scene in the Big Lebowski when the dude shows up at the bowling alley with that big giant briefcase phone and it keeps ringing. 
[01:56:00]  And that makes a whole scene right on out to the parking lot where his car is burning and the phone's still ringing.  And Donnie's like, phone's ringing, dude.  Yeah, that phone is giant.  Very good.  Thank you, Jay.  Old school.  All right.  Mm-hmm.  Don't fuck you, cheap prick.  Never mind what you would normally do.  Yeah.  You don't want to hear it.  But instead of writing a movie line there, that's just what a guy would say. 
[01:56:30]  Never mind.  Old guy.  Never mind what you would do.  Never mind.  That is just an old guy.  You don't want to hear it.  There's no oomph to that line at all.  I mean, you know, tip.  That's just great.  Yeah.  Fucking.  You know how true to, like, real interaction you have to be to write that line?  Yeah, yeah.  Fucking genius, man.  Oh, fuck.  But he counted too quick.  I didn't like that.  Like, Joe walks over and in half a second, who didn't throw in?  Yeah, who didn't throw in? 
[01:57:00]  How did you know?  Maybe he's a stickler for the details.  Yeah.  We have a radio station.  Kiss 108 in Boston, huh?  By the way, they cut a line out of that scene.  For real?  They probably just did it for time.  I think that was it.  When he goes, shoot this prick.  And what's his name goes to shoot.  Michael Madsen goes to shoot.  And Keitel goes, if you even dream of shooting me, you better wake up and apologize.  That was earlier in the scene.  Oh, was it earlier?  Yeah, yeah, yeah. 
[01:57:30]  Before they got to the tipping thing.  Because he goes, he says, I changed my mind.  Shoot this piece of shit.  Because, yeah, he kind of gave him that earlier.  Oh, okay.  So that's kind of a callback.  You better wake up and apologize.  And then Michael Madsen makes this little, like, again, another choice of fucking to smile and dance and do that silly song.  Actors are great actors.  Yeah, yeah.  And it does.  It puts this weird human element in these monstrous murderers. 
[01:58:00]  Yeah.  Talk about dialogue scenes from Tarantino, the Sicilian story in True Romance.  Oh, my God.  Of course.  Nothing to do with the fucking movie, in a way.  You're right.  Probably the best thing he's ever written.  I think so, too.  And the truest.  When he grabs that cigarette, like, okay, here I go.  I'm committing to this.  But Dennis Hopper's hands are my favorite part of the scene.  Like, huh, huh, and he's just waving his hand.  Fuck, I would never think to do that.  So we go up to Boston.  Kiss 108.  Ah, kiss 108. 
[01:58:30]  They're just a bunch of liars.  They were lying.  And they got caught lying.  I don't know.  What is it there?  Jingle Ball?  Yeah, you know.  Another unoriginal radio thing, by the way.  They don't even have a name for their show that's original.  Right.  The Jingle Ball.  Did it start with Z100 back in the day?  It's the first one that I know of.  I can't confirm that it started.  So you got a radio station like Z100, and they put a concert together around Christmas  time.  They call it the Jingle Ball.  It's okay.  You can admit it.  What? 
[01:59:00]  What happens?  I'm just saying it's okay.  You can admit it.  Say that 80 times.  Oh, geez.  Because the...  It's a new stink.  It's just like that.  Just the Jingle Ball.  They rip everybody off.  Yeah.  Then everyone else calls it the Jingle Ball.  I mean, why can't you just come up with another fucking festive name, I guess?  Like, yeah, how about the fucking, uh, the Winter Wonderland Christmas Folly extravaganza?  Gonza.  Gonza.  Gonza.  Gonza.  But that's their whole idea of, you know, iHeartRadio becoming the thing where, like,  individual stations don't even matter anymore. 
[01:59:30]  They're just trying to brand things.  Across the contrary.  Competing with the internet and iPod.  I can almost understand that.  I guess.  So, all right.  Their version of the Jingle Ball.  They were very excited because Miley Cyrus was coming into town.  She was, like, the headline performer.  Right.  So, you got, uh, these guys, you know, pumping it up that Miley's there.  They're broadcasting live.  Kiss 108, man.  It's getting...  Broadcasting live, I should say.  From backstage.  Backstage, all that shit.  Kiss 108, man.  It's getting exciting.  I'm standing outside with Miley Cyrus' dressing room.  She's about to go on stage and sound check, and we'll bring it to you live. 
[02:00:00]  Lady.  A little teaser-rooney there.  That'll keep the people.  Kiss 108 backstage at Jingle Ball.  Fall Out Boy on the radio right here.  They're in the house.  I'm with Joe P., the prize guy.  What is this?  Miley Cyrus might actually be, like, limping on stage.  What just happened with you?  You're not going to believe this.  She has a dancer that's, like, a little person.  I accidentally tripped over her and, like, pushed into Miley.  You, like, pushed her against the wall?  I didn't know why.  If you were fighting her?  Dude, it was so embarrassing.  It's going to be good, man.  All right.  She's not limping.  Is it sold on Jingle Ball all night long? 
[02:00:30]  So, you know, Miley's there, and they're making...  I would have to assume they're making believe that they're having interaction with Miley Cyrus.  I don't know.  They said they saw her walking around, and, oh, good, she's not limping.  Because this guy fell into her.  Well, he tripped over a midget and fell into Miley Cyrus.  They're just a bunch of liars.  She wasn't on the bill or anything.  She's the headliner.  She is the headliner.  Oh, okay.  We'll have the big reveal in a second.  All right.  Here's the deal.  We're bringing it to you live all night long on the radio and online. 
[02:01:00]  I've been posting up pictures.  I get so many backstage pictures.  It's kind of surreal, like, when you're just walking backstage, and you literally, like,  bump into Selena Gomez, or Miley Cyrus, or Fall Out Boy.  They're all here.  You can follow me on Instagram.  Okay.  That's a little plug.  Yeah.  You can...  Kiss 108.  I don't know if there's, like, a jacuzzi or a hot tub or a pool around here, something  I'm not seeing, but Miley Cyrus is wearing, like, a red bathing suit.  You'll see it all. 
[02:01:30]  Pictures and more all night long at kiss108.com.  Oh, boy.  It's going to be good.  So, you know, they're relating.  And Miley's crazy.  They're backstage.  Miley Cyrus is backstage.  Of course.  It's good to know that she's not just crazy on stage, though.  But also, yeah, backstage, she's just...  Oh, she's nutty.  She's backstage wearing a red bikini or a red bathing suit, whatever.  Tripping over midgets.  And this guy trips into her and falls into her, but she's okay.  Thank God.  Here's your big reveal, ladies and gentlemen.  Miley Cyrus, wrecking ball right there on Kiss 108. 
[02:02:00]  My name is Mikey V.  It is Jingle Ball Night.  Miley on the phone.  We're so sad you couldn't make it to the garden tonight.  You're still stuck in the airport right now?  Yeah.  I actually have been sitting at the airport for the past...  I guess this is now our seventh hour.  She was never there.  Oh, no.  They had to go on and...  They just pretended she was...  No, she'll be here.  She'll be here.  So they just faked everything.  They just made believe that she was...  And they made up the midget thing?  Everything made up.  They made all that shit up we just heard. 
[02:02:30]  Red bathing suit, all of it.  Why would you do that?  Hoping that she would show up and...  Wouldn't the bit be she's not here yet, then you could fucking fool around with that?  No.  In some way.  They want everyone to believe everything's okay, and then when they find out she's definitely  not going to be there, just pretend none of that happened.  Right.  I bet she was calling...  I bet those guys, like the program director, probably went, you know, you put her on.  She's calling, you put her on.  You have to.  Yeah.  So wait, where was she stuck?  She was in...  Bad weather, right?  Yeah.  It was a snowstorm. 
[02:03:00]  Yeah, that snowstorm.  I just couldn't get into Boston.  The liars.  Just a bunch of liars.  Oh, they got caught.  Oh, wow.  But the stories.  Like, it's not even...  Right.  Oh, yeah.  Miley Cyrus is going to be here.  It's...  I just saw her.  I saw her.  I know.  Here's what she was wearing.  Here's the interaction.  Bumped in her.  How fucking embarrassing.  And they didn't acknowledge that, like, they got caught.  Do they go back and go, wow, look at these lying sacks of boring shit that worked for  us?  No.  Jeez.  No, they never brought that up.  Because we said she was there. 
[02:03:30]  That's fucking embarrassing.  Yeah.  All right.  Before we go to break, don't forget, it's podcast day.  The O.P. and Anthony podcast.  Another great one, man.  We got the big gay getting squirted on by a porn star.  We got Kevin Hart, who's in that new movie with De Niro and Stallone.  Grudge Match.  Grudge Match.  So we got some of his fine appearances on the show.  And then we added, it just happened, but we decided to add it right away, the Lady Di  thing, where we messed with her. 
[02:04:00]  Oh, yeah.  I got to say, it was the hardest I laughed all year.  Yeah, that was so much fun.  I told Colin about that last night.  He called me about something else, like 10.30.  Yeah.  And then we were talking about Lady Di, and I went through the bit with him.  He was very pleased.  Oh, God.  I haven't laughed that hard.  Oh, no.  I've laughed a lot this year.  Oh, no.  That was the hardest I laughed.  He's doing 10 million beers.  He's like, no, I don't.  No, I don't drink 10 million beers.  No, no.  I don't even think that's possible.  Someone's got a Raiders jacket.  I don't know.  That's, what's his name for the Giants?  He does a show here. 
[02:04:30]  Oh, I always forget it.  Carl Bikes.  Carl Bikes.  Right?  Hmm.  I don't know.  You don't know football.  They're going into shade.  No, he does a show here.  Yeah.  Unless he doesn't anymore.  Everyone has to walk this way.  They have to walk past our studio.  A lot of these guys avoid our studio.  Oh, yeah.  They usually will not walk past our studio.  I don't see a lot of people we usually don't see.  No.  They all avoid us.  We're not liked.  Well, they don't bring guests by here because we have a reputation for figuring out some silly 
[02:05:00]  nickname for the guest and shouting it out the door and trying to get them to come in.  But why would that be bad?  Because we'll say no to them.  Why does everything have to be so fucking cookie-cutter organized?  It's a cookie-cutter.  Right.  Who gives a fuck if we open the door and yell something?  And if that leads to them coming on and just say...  Meh.  And they say hi for two minutes.  Who cares?  Because other shows get mad because they don't get time.  Well, go...  Well, who are these?  I don't even...  I couldn't even name another radio show here.  They're the shows that when they got the guest pitched to them, they said yes. 
[02:05:30]  So?  No, because we always say no and then we can't yell at the guest to come in regardless.  Because it's more fun that way.  Yeah, I mean, it is fun.  And why are we the only ones that don't give a fuck?  If one of these shows opened their stupid door and yelled and it was one of our guests,  I wouldn't care if that person went into that other studio for a couple minutes.  Right.  Who gives a fuck?  You're the only ones who don't give a fuck because you're at the top of the food chain.  Holla.  Oh, yeah.  So the podcast, Go Get It on iTunes.  And I guess we made some kind of iTunes list? 
[02:06:00]  Yes, we are part of the best of 2013 iTunes podcasts.  Nice.  Big.  iTunes selects only a few of the greatest.  Who also selects a podcast of 2013?  Well, let's see the company word.  Well, no.  You don't want to do that, huh?  No.  It's good.  It's not going to be as impressive.  All right.  All right.  Read off the other people in our category.  All right.  Jimmy needs to know.  We're going to podcast.  We sounded very impressive a mere minute or two ago. 
[02:06:30]  Yes.  Now watch.  We're in the new this year category.  Yeah, new this year.  We're in good company with who there, Sam?  Grantland, which is a big ESPN sports blog.  Right.  Welcome to Night Vale.  I don't know what that is.  Commonplace books.  Okay.  Oh, boy.  The Reed with Kid Fear.  I don't know what that is.  This doesn't seem.  The Reed.  Oh, no.  Jimmy needed to know, though.  This doesn't seem impressive. 
[02:07:00]  It's not as impressive.  Oh, this doesn't seem.  Keep going.  This is making me sad.  Stop reading.  Right.  I don't care about these other people.  They're nobody.  Why wouldn't you?  You were hoping for some big names on that list.  Yes, I was.  Joan Rivers is on the list.  I was hoping to hear maybe Joe Rogan, Penn Jillette.  They're not new this year.  Well, they're not new.  That's true.  They're new.  So even the category we're in isn't that impressive.  No.  You can't just take good news.  So the category is not impressive and the people we're with is not impressive.  As long as you're new, you're in. 
[02:07:30]  Right.  Who else?  You can't just take good news.  NFL.  Around the league.  All right.  That's big.  Jeff Garlin.  Okay.  Big name.  Yeah.  Alton Browncast from Nerdist.  Nerdist.  That's huge in podcasting.  All right.  That's a little better.  What about that one you're avoiding?  Which one?  The By the Way.  That's Jeff Garlin.  Oh, okay.  What about Saw?  Saw Bones.  What's that?  Marital Tour of...  It's for maximum fun. 
[02:08:00]  Yeah.  Oh, boy.  What do you mean a marital tour?  What does that mean, Sam?  Marital Tour of Misguided Medicine.  Oh, my God.  Oh, yeah.  We're in great company.  We're in great company.  You're right.  We don't...  Big list.  You can't just take good news.  No, I'd just like to hear something first.  All right.  Yeah, thanks.  We don't want to take mediocre news and turn it into good news.  Yeah.  Thanks for nothing.  This is not news.  What about that ginger cartoony thing?  That's your bar...  Oh.  Shane Dawson, who's a massive YouTube celebrity.  Oh, really? 
[02:08:30]  That's when you want to be lumped in with big YouTube celebrities.  Yeah.  You got millions of people.  What?  And?  Sparkle stories?  What the fuck is that?  What is that?  And Joan Rivers.  You said that already.  Yeah, you heard that.  Jeff Garland.  Just because you say...  Joan Rivers.  The one name we know twice doesn't make it more impressive for us.  Nerdist ESPN.  It's not the Nerdist podcast.  It's one of his lesser known podcasts.  Why would the Nerdist podcast be in New This Year?  But it's under the Nerdist label. 
[02:09:00]  Yes.  It doesn't mean it's...  It's New This Year.  That means a lot of people listen to it.  What are the other categories that we didn't end up in?  Right.  Exactly.  Best.  You know, best.  Well, there's Best New Video Podcast.  Not us.  What about Best New Audio Podcast?  Why couldn't we be that?  Because that went to Adam Carolla and Dr. Drew.  Which is bullshit because it's just the regular Adam Carolla show with Dr. Drew.  Right.  But technically it's a new show.  Okay.  All right.  And then Best Classic Video Podcast and Best Classic Audio Podcast. 
[02:09:30]  What is...  What is...  Video Podcast.  How embarrassing.  We can't even be a part of that.  What's Best Classic Video Podcast?  How do you get in that category?  Well, you just have to be on iTunes for more than a year.  Well.  All right.  So, congratulations to us.  Let's go get a fucking cake and celebrate.  Yeah.  You guys.  Oh, boy.  Let's get some...  Let's get a piece of dog duty and put a candle in it.  It can't just be...  Gives a fuck.  It can't just be good news, huh?  No.  No.  That's good mediocre news.  I understand what you're saying, Sam. 
[02:10:00]  I do.  But this is not impressive whatsoever.  There's a hundred new ones listed.  We're just one of them.  Right.  It gives a fuck.  It's not...  It's not that impressive.  Where would you want to be?  How about number one somewhere?  How about in the Best Podcast of the Year category?  That'd be nice.  Yeah.  There's only one Best Podcast and Adam Carolla set the Guinness Book of World Records for it.  So why couldn't they have others in that category?  Here's our Best Podcast of the Year.  They just have one.  Well, yes.  They have classics.  We should have been that one.  We are in the category.  Best New Podcast.  Oh, God. 
[02:10:30]  Best New This Year.  It's like getting nominated for a Shorty Award.  Oh, my God.  Those cocksucking liars.  Fuck them.  I hate the Shorty Award people.  I hate it.  I blocked them.  Yes, I did, too.  He was nominated.  He went to the awards ceremony.  Oh, I forgot.  Anthony hired a limo.  What an asshole.  I forgot where it's coming from.  That's stupid.  I have a speech right now.  I have a speech.  Hired a video crew.  This is my big moment.  Here I go.  You know, I want to thank all the little people.  Oh, God.  That's hilarious. 
[02:11:00]  You won nothing.  Nothing.  It's funny.  You bastards.  You left with a bunch of empty beer cans and sweaty pits and no awards.  Oh, my God.  I hate the fucking Shorty Award people.  Terrible.  I hate them.  Yeah, that's nonsense.  Leave us out of that shit, please.  I fucking loathe.  I never would support them.  I wasn't like you went home with an arm full of awards either there, Jimmy.  No, but this is what happened.  Wait, Jimmy went too, right?  No.  No, he refused to go.  These cunts.  These fucking.  But didn't we have a table for everybody? 
[02:11:30]  No, they wanted me to pay for tickets.  Oh, right, right.  You got to be a fucking mind, bitch.  No.  And then they fucking told me,  could I have more votes than someone or whatever?  And they still gave it to the other person.  Yeah.  So I just started blasting them on Twitter as being fucking liars.  And then they felt bad.  They, oh, no, well, you won too.  I told the guy through email,  don't ever fucking contact me again.  Wait, you officially won?  Yeah.  They sent me an email saying,  you may have won.  We need you to call.  No, I know that.  It's the same thing, yeah.  It's not a popular vote, though.  No.  No.  That's just it.  I had the most votes in my category, 
[02:12:00]  and Jim had the most in his.  And then you.  Oh, there's some politics involved.  And then there's, there's like a judging thing,  so they give it to someone else.  I'll go fuck yourself.  Fuck you.  I hate those fucking cocksuckers.  Bullshit.  And what did you say when they said,  we want you to pay for tickets?  I would, I absolutely refuse.  I would never, ever fuck the check out to.  Oh, I went online.  I went online and, and bought tickets.  You bought tickets?  Well, I wanted to go.  Who wins an award and buys tickets?  I know.  He was like, all right, I'll pay for the tickets. 
[02:12:30]  I think I'm going to win.  The numbers don't lie.  I certainly wasn't going to miss this gala event.  How was it?  It was the cheapest, shittiest thing I've ever been to.  Sucked.  Fuck them.  Yeah.  Honoring the best in social media.  Fuck you.  Cocksuckers.  Good for you.  I have a big announcement, too.  Oh, do you?  I've been waiting for this,  but I'm going to just spring it now.  Uh-oh.  AIDS.  No, no, that would be, no one, who would be shocked? 
[02:13:00]  Really?  We'd all be sad, but who would be shocked?  My website, MerchandisePage, is open.  The Jim Norton store.  Oh, yay.  You can buy gift cards for people.  Open for business.  Go to JimNorton.com.  I've got a bunch of dates come up in Mount Kisco, Las Vegas, San Diego, Raleigh, North Carolina,  Atlanta.  I just added Washington, D.C.  Washington.  Atlantic City in February.  Nice.  So, you know, you guys asked me to come to your city.  I'm coming to your fucking city.  You better go to the show or he's not coming back. 
[02:13:30]  It's amazing.  People are like, when are you going to come to your city?  And I go to the city.  And they make me make it the last minute to buy tickets.  And you're celebrating the fact that we're one of the top 800 new podcasts of the year.  And all the material is different than it is on American Degenerate.  All of it.  Look at you.  Sam, you think we don't like getting good news?  Yes, I do.  Why?  You want real good news.  You have to turn everything into a bad news scenario.  Like what we just went through.  No, that's one.  That sucked.  Like? 
[02:14:00]  You don't generally look on the bright side of things.  We're just being honest about that.  That's a real gives a fuck thing.  Right.  That's a nice honor for iTunes to say that.  I don't care.  They say that about everyone new this year.  No, they didn't say it about everyone new.  There's a giant walking down the hall.  There was like 12 shows that they nominated.  Oh my God.  That guy's big.  Who is that?  I'll tell you in a second, I think.  Oh, he's a...  Is that...  Is that...  Does he play basketball?  Is that...  That's Bob Lanier.  Oh, yeah. 
[02:14:30]  It's Bob Lanier!  Bob Lanier?  God damn it!  Bob Lanier!  You want me to open the door?  Yo, Bob it!  It's Bob Lanier!  Is that Bob Lanier?  You better go take that picture.  You think so?  Yeah.  Yeah, that's a biggie.  That's an NBA great biggie.  Literally a biggie.  He's very tall.  You're one of 12 shows nominated.  Hundreds of podcasts were launched this year.  Yes.  Oh, who gives a shit.  Is that really Bob Lanier?  Yes.  He's a giant basketball player.  Yes.  Yes. 
[02:15:00]  Bob Lanier.  Who was it?  It wasn't Bob Lanier.  You don't think so?  No.  Who was it?  I don't know.  He's very tall.  Don't get your picture with Bob Lanier.  Hold on a second.  I'm just checking to make sure.  What?  Who is that guy?  We don't know, do we?  I think it's Bob Lanier.  Bob Lanier.  It's Bob Lanier.  He's on the sheet for today.  All right.  We'll see.  You've got to believe me.  It's Bob Lanier. 
[02:15:30]  Yeah?  Mm-hmm.  It really is.  It is.  I swear, yeah.  I thought it was, too.  I even know that one.  Yes, that's him.  I can see the picture.  Go get your Bob Lanier.  No, he's doing a show.  With who?  I don't know.  But he's doing a...  Can I say he's in the sports one?  Oh, okay.  They're not on the iTunes new this year.  Best of 2013, by the way.  New.  Also, I will be tweeting in two seconds here the video I made of Mike Bichetti spending 
[02:16:00]  10 straight minutes trying to fix his headphones during a commercial break yesterday.  That was...  Oh, here comes Kenny.  What happened?  You want two minutes with him?  No.  Okay.  What is he promoting?  I don't know.  I don't remember much about him anymore.  I know.  Oh, shit.  It's too late now.  Oh, Jesus.  All right.  Come on in.  Say hi. 
[02:16:30]  Bob Lanier.  Quick little stop in.  Say hi.  How are you?  Yeah.  Wow.  Bob Lanier.  Sir.  How are you doing?  Pleasure.  It's a pleasure.  Pleasure.  Nice to meet you.  Oh, yeah.  Where are we going to take the picture?  Oh, Jimmy.  Oh, I was going to take one.  Yes.  Come on.  Yeah, I want to take a picture with Bob Lanier.  Of course.  Bob, what are you promoting today real fast?  We're doing an NBA care season of giving.  Okay.  We're on NBA radio and kind of tell folks about what the league, the teams, the players are 
[02:17:00]  doing to make a difference and give during the holidays.  Right.  Great.  It's about giving, sharing, and inspiring.  Right.  Where do they go?  Everywhere.  It's all over.  No, I mean, is there a website or something that everyone is directed to?  NBAbig at NBA.com.  Okay.  Right?  It's charity?  It's all charity.  It's about volunteering, about what our players are doing in the marketplace, what our corporate  partners are doing in the marketplace.  Okay. 
[02:17:30]  Nice.  Let's take a picture with Bob Lanier.  Take a picture.  I don't want to keep you.  Yeah, take a picture.  God damn, you're short, man.  Oh, Jimmy's short.  Yes.  Very nice.  Oh, there you go.  I hope he's taking a nice picture.  That's great.  All right.  Thank you.  Take care, sir.  What's the website again?  NBAbig at NBA.com.  Okay.  NBAbig at NBA.com.  NBA.com.  Thank you, guys. 
[02:18:00]  Take care.  Thank you, gentlemen.  Take care.  He's very tall.  He just ducked.  Ducking under the door like that.  How tall is he, Ken?  You're what, 6'4", 6'5"?  Yeah, he's taller than me.  That bums you out, doesn't it?  I hope he's in the back of my photo.  What?  You're in the back of my photo.  Oh, sorry.  Kareem mentioned him in...  Airplane.  An airplane, yeah.  Because you tell your dad...  Yeah.  Have your dad chased Walton and Lanier up and down the court all day?  Yeah.  Yeah, they battled it out for many years. 
[02:18:30]  Yeah.  He's listed at 6'11".  That's about right.  Whew.  Yeah.  That's about right.  That's got to just be a fucking hassle.  How old is he?  Anthony's in my picture, too.  Oh, yeah.  I leaned in there, Jimmy.  Whoa, what happened, Jimmy?  Oh, no.  I may have leaned in and smiled.  Oh, Anthony, you don't look very handsome in my photo.  I leaned in and I may have made a big smiley.  Oh, no.  Can I see that, too?  Anthony ruined my picture.  And Opie's on the other side. 
[02:19:00]  I don't like this picture.  We wrecked your picture.  Aw.  Aw.  You can figure it out, right?  A little Photoshop.  I'm Lanier.  Sorry.  I'm Lanier.  I just awkwardly went to the other side.  Jimmy didn't know.  No, I sensed you coming.  I'm like, oh, no.  Because the guy is...  Oh, he's ruining my picture.  The guy is so enormous that I just walked behind him and went to the other side.  And Jimmy had no idea.  But then Opie got his own picture with him. 
[02:19:30]  You should have then got your own.  On your camera, too, by the way.  Oh, boy.  Cool.  We'll see if that makes sense.  Delete.  Are you mad?  You probably could get it.  No.  Not at all.  I sensed you.  All right.  That's funny.  It's not like an Abdul-Jabbar or Magic Johnson.  It's just...  Oh, no.  Bob Lanier is a biggie.  No, but I'm glad we got him.  He's one of the top 50 all-time greats, I believe.  He made that list.  That would have been a tough idea.  I believe.  Huh?  That would have been a tough idea.  Yeah.  Well, yeah.  How many times do you bang your head before you're just naturally... 
[02:20:00]  Fucking a lot.  Nice.  You naturally duck under everything like you did.  Yeah.  You just, like, ducks.  To get out a normal-sized door, he's got to just duck.  We were just talking about that and see what happened?  He came in quick.  It was whatever.  But we just got to meet Bob Lanier.  Well, he didn't even know what it was.  He just wanted to take a picture.  So he didn't, like...  He didn't know he was going to talk at all.  And the listeners really enjoy when we get to meet people.  So they do.  They love that and a food break.  Oh, yeah.  So this was a big coup for everyone.  Us eating and taking photos with celebrities is probably the two greatest things for the listeners. 
[02:20:30]  You want a picture?  That we don't.  No.  I don't.  I'm not a basketball guy.  If, you know, it was some oldie-time football player or something, or a baseball player,  I'd take a picture.  I'd just take a picture because it looks ridiculous.  It does look ridiculous.  Some guy now is saying that he knows a woman that fucked him in Milwaukee.  Now, I don't know if that's true, but giant cock.  I was going to ask.  I would hope so.  Because he has the giant feet.  He's got a fucking 11. 
[02:21:00]  His shoes are legendary.  If you're tall like that, you better have a big dick because you would look silly.  You would look 5'7".  You'd look silly.  All right.  We're going to take a break.  Oh, no.  Yes.  Someone's reminding me.  I remember when two radio hosts lied about bra-bombing on the air.  What?  Oh, well, that was a bit.  They were trying to lie about Miley Cyrus, like, to really let people think that.  Miley Cyrus.  No, I'll.  Sorry.  Why am I arguing? 
[02:21:30]  I'm an asshole.  I'll take the angle that we were just as douchey.  What are you going to do?  Well, yeah.  It was douchey.  I guess our point over the years is you've got to live and learn at least.  Yeah.  What are you going to do?  Try to fucking grow from it.  I don't remember that bit.  What?  The bra-bombing.  Yeah, I don't remember it either.  We got the tapes.  No, we don't really have them anymore.  Well, I think we do.  I don't think we do either.  We should do a douchey podcast.  Fucking doucheyest moments.  Doucheyest moments.  Douchey.  We're trying to have themes to our podcast if you guys haven't figured it out yet. 
[02:22:00]  Dude, that's great.  This week's a regular one, but it's still really good.  But we got to do doucheyest moments.  You guys would actually have to host that one, though, so you could have some kind of commentary.  Fuck yeah.  That'd be great.  We're damaging the doucheyness.  Yeah, we could do that.  Bombs and Flubs would be probably a funny podcast.  No one puts on a podcast themselves bombing.  Right.  Or a part of a podcast.  Yeah.  Right.  What's next week's podcast?  Next week's is Mom Stories.  Oh, yeah.  We're doing that one.  Good. 
[02:22:30]  We'll see another theme.  It's going to be some of our mom stories.  Yeah.  We have plenty of material to do many episodes of those.  Yeah.  We'll wait until we're back in the new year to do the douchey one.  Yeah.  Promote it and everything.  Yeah.  But down the road.  Yes.  Dave.  Subscribe to our podcast, please.  The numbers are moving upwards.  Yeah.  Nicely.  That's why we got nominated.  Very nicely.  Best of 2013.  We've had a bunch that have gone over the 100,000 mark. 
[02:23:00]  Oh, yeah.  That's pretty fucking impressive.  It's very impressive.  Indeed.  iTunes should fucking acknowledge that.  They did.  Barely.  There were only 12 nominated.  Yeah, but how many fucking downloads are those dummies getting?  A lot.  Not like ours.  It's ESPN and NFL.  Nah, we're bigger than ESPN.  That's not the case.  We're huge.  That is the case.  Yes.  Ari Shaffir is here.  Okay.  I was watching a show last night on the Tuskegee Airmen. 
[02:23:30]  Oh, yeah.  I read your tweet.  Were you booing the TV?  No, I was not.  I was definitely interested and fascinated.  Just amazing men.  Absolute heroes.  And just class guys.  Some of the real pilots were being interviewed for the show.  And just intelligent, articulate, funny. 
[02:24:00]  You know, and not like portrayed in the movie.  Oh, really?  Everything has to be like jive and like, yeah, Mr. Hitler.  There was no jive talking or anything like that.  They're pilots and they presented themselves as the class acts that they knew they had to be to transcend the racism that was going on in the military and in the country.  You're saying they were misrepresented in the movie?  I was saying that if they were, they have to be pissed off by that. 
[02:24:30]  Do you mean that movie or all movies?  Well, all movies.  I didn't see the Tuskegee Airmen movie.  It's all movies.  And the fact of the matter is, like, rap artists and stuff are looked up to and fucking the black culture is so full of, like, the negative stereotypes and whatnot.  And these guys should be looked at as heroes and things to aspire to because they're just, they were amazing.  They fought in World War II and then they had one of the guys that was talking about it. 
[02:25:00]  And it's just fascinating stories of combat and dog fighting and stuff.  It's not like white kids are looking up to, like, white heroes.  They're looking up to, like, Justin Bieber and shitty people like that.  You know what?  It's not permeating the culture as badly as some of the negativity and prison culture and gangsta culture that is permeating some of the black community like this.  The thing I noticed was these guys had to prove themselves. 
[02:25:30]  And they did.  They went above and beyond.  At a time when, you know, people throw around the word racism now over nothing.  You criticize a black person, you're a racist, racist, racist.  These guys faced fucking racism.  They're one of the guys talking about when they get done, he flew all his missions, he was shot down, he was captured, he was a prisoner.  He, finally, the war ends, he comes back on the boat.  They did all this. 
[02:26:00]  His buddies died, all this shit.  They get off the boat in New York and he goes, and right there at the bottom of the plank, a guy was going,  whites to the left, niggers to the right.  And he goes, Jesus Christ, I fucking fought.  Those guys faced fucking racism.  And that's why, as annoyed as I get at political correctness, and I fucking hate it, and I hate the, it's just an overreaction to that.  This isn't, this is the, you know, the pendulum, it's just gone the other way, but it's all a reaction to that shit. 
[02:26:30]  But it's insulting to these guys, the guys that deserve the hero worship to call out someone as a racist for criticizing a black person.  These guys faced real racism.  They knew what it was like.  They risked, literally risked their lives.  Some of them lost their lives, and then they were treated like shit for many years after that.  But that's what bugs me about our country. 
[02:27:00]  It's like the people, like America, the way we look at ourselves now, we're a very fair place.  We're a very open place.  That's exactly how we saw ourselves then.  It's not like in the 40s, America went, wow, we really are kind of shitty and unfair to a lot of people.  Never.  If you said that you were a communist or a non-patriot, people in America looked at ourselves in the 40s as a great oasis of freedom.  Right.  And yet that was happening.  There was that underlying lie.  But by 48, they started integrating, it wasn't a segregated army anymore. 
[02:27:30]  What year did these guys do that?  That was in the 40s, you know, from 1941 up to 45.  And then by 48, they realized, you know, we've got to stop segregating the armed forces.  We can't have two armies and two air corps and everything like that.  So they started.  So it did start building.  Right.  But the thing is, and regardless, the wrongs that happened and everything, they had to prove themselves, and they did.  Through hard work, instead of making an excuse, 
[02:28:00]  they proved themselves.  Did they, should they have had to have?  No.  But they knew that that's what they had to do.  And they did it.  And to watch these guys talk, just eloquently speaking, and they went through so much.  It was really an amazing thing.  If you get to see it, it was called Air Aces on the military channel on the Tuskegee Airmen.  Just a great show. 
[02:28:30]  Did the movie show them, like, accurately or no?  Well, the movie, no, it was George Lucas, so it was mostly action.  And I don't think, here's the problem.  I don't think a lot of young black guys want to see black guys, unless they're speaking, you know,  like their favorite fucking rap artists.  So if you go to a movie, and you see someone talking like an Uncle Tom,  you're not going to look at him with any hero worship.  He's going to be some fucking asshole that's, you know, kowtowing to the man. 
[02:29:00]  So they kind of jive him up a little bit, you know.  Yeah, Mr. Hitler!  Did they really say that in the movie?  These guys were, like, they're aviated.  They're fucking flying planes.  They're very smart.  Yeah.  The way they spoke about it, the way they conveyed the stories of their battles was amazing.  It wasn't done with any fucking shucking and jiving.  Although the movie bombed.  It bombed.  It totally bombed.  People still saw it.  Yeah, yeah. 
[02:29:30]  Well, the movie sucked.  Right.  I didn't think the movie was a good, accurate portrayal.  Who starred in that?  Terrence Howard.  Yeah, Terrence Howard was in it.  Are you feeling all right?  Why?  I don't know.  You're defending black people.  No, I'm defending.  I'm actually not.  It's the opposite thing.  I'm insulting.  Yeah, no, he's not defending black people.  I'm insulting young black people that won't look further than a fucking...  But he is defending black people.  ...a rap artist or prison culture as something that should be aspired to.  There's a spin in it, but he is defending black people. 
[02:30:00]  I'm defending black people back then in reference to what they're not doing now.  Yes, but the passion is a little strange today.  An amazing time for these young black pilots, and it was just...  For these colored fellas.  For the colored pilots, yes.  Right.  In defending black people, he's saying that he is very anti...  Other black people.  Of 2013.  That's the genius of Anthony.  He's now using black people to go after other black people. 
[02:30:30]  Damn, I'm so transparent.  Wow.  Okay, now I get it.  He's using the Tuskegee...  How do you say it?  Tuskegee Airmen.  Tuskegee.  To bludgeon young black males with.  Oh, man.  And he's using words like eloquent?  Yes, yes.  And well-spoken.  Well-spoken.  Those are key phrases.  Those are key words because then it's implying that now they're not.  That's right.  And that's also...  Those are key words of the white bigots.  True.  When they see a black person speak a certain way, they go, oh, he's well-spoken.  Well, I don't like when people are called out as racist or bigoted when you point out how nicely a black man speaks. 
[02:31:00]  It's very eloquent.  Just like it would be a white man speaking eloquently and nicely.  It is funny, though.  I've never heard white people or white politicians referred to as well-spoken.  Aren't you surprised when somebody from West Virginia...  It's like, where are you from?  West Virginia.  And you're like, wow, you don't sound like you're from West Virginia.  That right there is the same thing.  That's a location thing, though.  That's a location thing.  A location is different. 
[02:31:30]  You could call it whatever you want.  Location or a culture.  You got your brother on the line.  Oh, no.  Brother Joe.  Uh-oh.  Hey, Joe.  Oh, no.  What?  No, no.  What a negativity.  Oh, no.  I'm just joking, Joe.  No, Joe's on the phone.  Because I've carefully positioned my chess pieces.  Yeah, no.  I don't need you flipping the board over.  I figure you're going to knock out of me.  From a military perspective, from a military perspective, even as low down on the pecking order as a foot soldier, the guys that I was in the Army with that stepped up to become airborne troops or special forces or rangers, the black guys I'm talking about, were infinitely different from the guys that were regular-like troops or infantry troops. 
[02:32:00]  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I mean, their intelligence level was, they tried harder.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Yeah, but they were way more into what they were doing, and they weren't the kind of guys that would be, well, back then rap really wasn't an issue, but it was a- 
[02:32:30]  There was still a prison culture kind of a thing, and this perpetual victimization thing is what I don't get.  Like I said, should they have had to prove themselves?  No.  Everybody should start out on equal footing and whatnot.  But then knowing that they had to go above and beyond, they went above and beyond and showed people. 
[02:33:00]  I mean, they had to face white officers that said black people could never fly a plane, never mind do it proficiently and get awards for what they did.  But they knew they had to do it better than the white people, and they stepped up and did it.  That is gone now.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Well, you can see that on the Military Channel as well with that Surviving the Cut. 
[02:33:30]  Yeah, I like that show, too.  Those guys.  Those guys.  I mean, yeah, anyone that goes above and beyond the bare minimum, you know, being in the Army.  And it is anyone.  You're right.  It doesn't matter what your color is.  If you go above and beyond, you're going to be recognized for that no matter who you are.  You shouldn't have to – you shouldn't get any special treatment either way.  A movie that depicts the Tuskegee Airmen I found way better than any other was Red Tails. 
[02:34:00]  Did you see that one?  Yeah, that's the one I was talking about.  I don't think it was good.  Red Tails, a lot of it –  It's the one that sucked.  Is that George Lucas' movie?  Yes.  It's terrible.  This is the one that Ant was saying.  They were like, yo, Mr. Hitler.  There was an HBO movie called the Tuskegee Airmen.  Yeah.  In a couple of spots, but it did show the kind of racism that these guys went on a daily basis.  Wait, what was the HBO movie, though, called the Tuskegee Airmen?  It was the Tuskegee Airmen.  Was that a documentary or a movie?  No, I think it was a movie.  It was.  Yeah.  Who was in that one? 
[02:34:30]  That's what I'm thinking of.  I'm not sure who was in that one.  They did make it.  Hold on, who?  Cuba Gooding Jr.  There was a –  I don't know who Cuba Gooding Jr. is.  Kenny.  Do you play the – I almost said, do you play the tuba, and I'm like, oh, that would  have been right.  Scoop book.  All right, Joe, take it easy, man.  I'll love it.  I'll talk to you.  Bye, buddy.  We got Ari Shafir waiting.  Oh, right.  We really got to take a break.  Lawrence Fishburne, thank you.  Oh, it was Lawrence Fishburne?  Yeah.  He was great in Glory.  So white people were shitty?  He wasn't in Glory.  It was the other guy.  White people were shitty to black people. 
[02:35:00]  Apparently.  So, yeah, he was defending black people.  No.  Yeah, he was.  Not at all.  No, I think I know white people were pretty shitty to black people, but I really did appreciate  listening to these guys and how they realized and stepped up and really kind of – they  are real heroes that should be looked at and you should aspire to that.  As opposed to –  But, no, he should stop right there.  See, he's defending black people right there.  As opposed to – 
[02:35:30]  Well, we're going to get to that, obviously.  But not right now.  But I think he was even more surprised that they weren't homies.  No, I –  No, I –  That's exactly what this –  He goes, what?  These guys aren't homies.  I knew that.  They're well-spoken.  They spoke so –  I knew that.  How many young people – like, young people always look up to the rebels, though.  Like, you know, like rock – young white kids.  Dude, a fucking fighter pilot?  No, no, no, no, no, no.  They are like the kick-ass motherfuckers to look up to.  But young people don't usually look up to the well-spoken – white – like, you know, 
[02:36:00]  you don't look up to the guys who are genuinely – like, maybe in the 60s they looked up to – or  the 70s they looked up to Buzz Aldrin.  But you look at young people today.  They don't look up to Neil Armstrong or Buzz Aldrin.  Like, you know what I mean?  Great.  They look up to fucking –  Two Chines.  Yeah, or fucking rock stars.  Well, that's the encroachment of horrid criminal culture on young whites these days, too.  There it is.  That's what I'm saying.  Satanism.  That's what I'm saying.  In the 80s, were they worshiping Buzz Aldrin?  No, they were listening to fucking Satan. 
[02:36:30]  How do you do?  You sound like Tipper Gore right now.  Exactly.  What?  I know.  Parental advisory stickers.  That's right.  That's what you're asking for.  I'm saying you can listen to –  Dee Snider's going to be pissed at you.  I'm saying listen to whatever you want.  But as far as hero worship goes, and if you want to speak – if you want to speak like  a fucking gangster, you're not going to get a good job.  What about you?  That's what it is.  All right.  We've got to take a break.  We've got to take a break.  We'll continue with this in a few minutes. 
[02:37:00]  Stay there.  After these messages, we'll be right back.  Ari Shafir entering the studio.  What up, yo?  What's up, Ari?  What's up, guys?  Welcome back.  Thank you, Saint.  Are you on right now?  You're at Stand Up New York this Friday and Saturday here in – oh, and Christmas Eve.  My, they got you for Christmas Eve.  Yeah.  I'm at the cellar tonight, too.  And that's a cellar? 
[02:37:30]  No, that's Saturday.  Excuse me, not tonight.  It's Saturday.  Do you mind working Christmas Eve?  You know, it's always black people and Asians and Jews.  Yeah, true.  Yeah, that's true.  But it's not a religious holiday anymore.  No, it's not.  It really isn't.  I mean, you know, it's really not.  I go over to, like, my aunt, uncles, and families on Christmas Eve, and we're not talking  anything about Jesus.  At all, right?  No.  No, Jesus.  We watch the holidays.  Thanksgiving's the same thing.  We watch Frosty the Snowman and Santa Claus is Coming to Town.  Drink wine.  Not some weird Jesus movie. 
[02:38:00]  Yeah.  Do kids still watch that weird claymation version of Frosty the Snowman?  Frosty the Snowman?  Yeah, that...  We all watched when we were little.  How about I've seen it 20 times this season a lot?  Wasn't Frosty just a cartoon, though?  And, like, Rudolph was the claymation shit?  You're absolutely right.  Oh, yeah.  Frosty is animation.  Yeah, Frosty's just a cartoon.  Oh, you're right.  He had the snow god thing.  Snow.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  And then they had the...  Yeah, Rudolph is the one with all the...  Rudolph is the claymation.  Trust me, I know this stuff.  Oh, yeah.  I think it's Tim Burton to, like, redo that stuff in, like, a real way. 
[02:38:30]  And make it look, like, really dark.  Yeah.  Whenever Rudolph loses his mom, she's, like, see him cry.  I want to take revenge.  Yeah.  You know?  Why not just redo it frame by frame, but with newer technology?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Or at least just dub it over.  Fuck yeah.  CGI that shit.  I'm watching him every day.  I got a three-and-a-half-year-old, so he discovered the Christmas shit.  Oh, cool.  He loves Frosty.  Is he all, like, fucking, like, frothed up about Christmas as a kid?  Do they get, like...  He's getting it, yeah. 
[02:39:00]  He knows, yeah, he knows, like, that's the day where I get some cool shit.  Are you giving him the lie?  Are they going to reveal it later, or are you telling him right from the start?  Ah, yeah, right.  The lie.  Yeah.  Well, I'm...  Yeah, you got to go with the lie, but you also want to get a little credit, so it's like...  Yeah, Santa brought you there.  Here's a few things from Mom and Dad.  I got you, yeah.  I can't believe, like, our parents went through that.  Yeah.  Just, like, not getting credit for anything.  Yeah.  Oh, yeah, we didn't have that.  Hanukkah is, like, very clearly, this is from your aunt. 
[02:39:30]  Oh, really?  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  I was supposed to Santa Claus.  I just came back in with my zipper open.  Yeah, Santa Claus.  But, wow, man, we got great...  We always had great Christmases growing up.  We really did.  I always talk about the shitty stuff that happened in my family, but we had...  They just save up for Christmas.  They saved up for Christmas.  We had amazing Christmases, and these gifts would be coming in, and my parents would have  to sit there and not take any of the fucking credit.  That's crazy.  It started...  As a kid, though, you started realizing, like, all these dumb stories of Santa and the elves  with the little hammers and nails, and then this wonderful Mattel fucking toy I got. 
[02:40:00]  Like, they didn't make this shit.  Right.  I saw this on the TV.  What the fuck?  Yeah, yeah.  That didn't make sense to me.  I can only, like, rectify it by going, like, no, Santa is in charge of the Mattel places.  Oh, okay.  Something like that.  That's it.  He's like strong-arming Mattel to mob tactics.  My parents always took credit.  Like, every time I got a nice toy, I was like, oh, Santa.  My father would lift my mother's dress and point at her vagina and say, do you know how  many times your mother had to sell this to get that for you? 
[02:40:30]  By the way, kids, Santa is real.  Oh, of course Santa's real.  We knew where the gifts were hidden one year, me and my brother.  We got the shit beat out of us one year because we, oh, sorry, I'm jumping on your story, but  you just, we fucking peaked.  Yeah, yeah.  And we got a beating for it.  What?  Jesus Christ.  We're getting a beating over fucking Christmas gifts.  It's the opposite of Santa.  Yes.  Dude, white trash people are weird.  A beast. 
[02:41:00]  Sorry.  I jumped on your story.  No, it's cool.  Well, me and my brother knew where the presents were hidden, but see, here's the fucking monkey  wrench in there was Dawn.  Our sister, she, if she saw us peaking, she would have ratted us out.  So we had to do something.  But why would you like snoop if she was around?  Why didn't you wait for her to be somewhere else?  Where's she going?  On a fucking date?  She was eight.  She's got nothing to do with that.  Yes, she's seven or something.  But how small was your place? 
[02:41:30]  It was pretty small.  It was hidden in the garage.  All right.  All right.  Fair enough.  It's one of those kids that just follow you around and shit.  So, and we couldn't really get a good look.  So, so, uh, we had to make it so she couldn't rat us out.  So we, uh, we pull her aside and, and made her curse so we could then blackmail her.  Yeah.  It's like, Dawn, you want to curse, right?  And she's like, no, no, I wasn't.  And we're like, come on.  It's just fun.  And she's like, and then she finally was like, okay, shit.  And we're like, all right, look, we're going to look at the, it turned on a dime. 
[02:42:00]  It turned on a dime.  She's like, come on, Dawn, it'll be fun.  She goes, okay, shit.  All right, look, we're going to look at the presents.  Or if you tell, we're going to fucking say that.  We can do this one of two ways.  Yeah, yeah.  The easy way, the hard way.  Fucking evil, man.  Jesus.  So we looked, you know, stuff.  What'd you see?  I saw, I was helping my mother bring the gifts out one year, the first year she let me do it.  And I saw the Peter Criss solo album or something, something Peter Criss I saw through.  I was like, oh, Peter Criss. 
[02:42:30]  And she's like, well, we won't let you do this again.  She was mad that she bought a shitty fucking wrapping paper.  Why is she letting you take out gifts that are for you?  I was just being helpful.  We were upstairs.  Good boy.  Yes, I'm a good boy.  Good boy.  I'm a good boy.  We were upstairs and we like pulled back the curtain or whatever.  Yeah.  And I saw my dad coming across the street with 10-speed bikes.  Oh, shit.  We got a good yelling because he saw that we were looking.  Oh, you're just looking out the wind.  Because I was supposed to do.  It wasn't a doubt. 
[02:43:00]  It was just an excuse.  It's supposed to be something nice and it just ends in a beating.  He just got really upset.  He was bummed, I think, because that was the big gift that year.  But, I mean, when you're kids, you're fucking beyond excited.  Of course.  It's like hardcore sex when you're that age.  The best thing you can possibly get is a good Christmas present.  The best thing to do is buy those type of gifts and let your kids see them.  Oh, my God.  What is this?  What is that, Sam?  Where?  You know all the photos.  Wearing a white fur coat with a spotted dolly shot.  It's Anthony in 1970.  I know.  My mom got me a fur coat when I was in elementary school because Joe Namath had one. 
[02:43:30]  How great would it be if your father was buying those bikes just so you could see them  and then he brought them back immediately so the next morning they just weren't there?  Without explanation.  Enjoy your life, Borgang.  Oh, he was so bummed that we saw him before Christmas.  We were so cheap and dewy that all we do is look at each other's presents as we're opening  our own.  We just look at it to see what everyone else is getting.  Oh, because he just knew it was shit.  Yeah.  What's the worst thing you got on Hanukkah?  My dad was gone once and it was just like clothes. 
[02:44:00]  It really was just like garbage.  Clothes suck.  They do suck.  We know you need socks.  You think I need them.  Isn't it amazing how young you can be and still know that that sucks?  It could be the wrapped box and you're like, I know what this is.  You just know from the shape and the weight and everything.  It's like, this is shitty fucking clothes.  Ant getting me some fucking dumb shirt.  You've seen that Xbox video, right?  That black kid getting the Xbox?  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  One of the greatest. 
[02:44:30]  That is a good one.  One of the greatest videos.  And what's in the box or something?  It's fucking clothes or something normal.  What did you think you were getting an Xbox?  Look at him.  And they just zoom in and they watch him slowly start to cry.  Can I see this?  It's so sad.  Sam, can you find that?  Who was that guy?  The Xbox 360 prank.  Yeah, you got to remember.  They did get an Xbox, all right?  No, they put that down there, but there was no proof of that.  I know, that's true.  Who was the guy?  They fucked him over.  I think it was a young Obama.  It could have been Johnny Weir.  That's Johnny Weir again?  I'm not positive. 
[02:45:00]  Johnny Weir?  He's been here before.  Who's that?  I know the name.  He's an ice skater.  It's very easy to put a little play on his last name.  Oh, is that who that was?  Walking in me.  Is this it?  Yeah.  I don't think I've...  Maybe I've seen it.  I think we have.  Oh, let's see.  Have you played this before?  Okay.  I bet it was probably last Christmas.  Fair enough.  Look how excited he is.  I can't see it, Sam. 
[02:45:30]  Oh.  Here's the little kid.  He's...  He drops the box because he realizes it's an Xbox.  It's like...  Oh, it's an Xbox.  Oh, look at that Xbox box.  I forgot that.  They got it in the Xbox box.  Yeah, it's in a...  Are you serious?  This is the cruelest fucking thing.  I know.  You're so light.  What is he, like, nine?  The kid's like...  Open it up.  Open the box.  Big smile. 
[02:46:00]  Oh, boy.  There he goes.  Little buckly here.  And then...  And then he looks in.  Oh, shit.  Oh, shit.  Close the net.  Pulls the net.  I've never stopped filming him.  Oh, boy.  The kid is devastated.  That is so hurt.  It's not saying anything.  They're just pointing and laughing at him.  What did you think he was? 
[02:46:30]  Johnson, we can't afford an Xbox 360.  Oh, you fucking...  Why'd you do that?  We can't afford an Xbox.  I know it was me.  Oh, he's not pleased.  No.  He's got Sam Roberts hair.  Yeah.  It's like demolition, man.  It's like you had a flood.  These are bad people.  Yeah, this is bad people.  Yeah.  They obviously got the Xbox.  Yeah, of course they got it for you. 
[02:47:00]  Obviously.  Keep in mind, that's their foster kid.  Oh, man.  That's a school shooter look.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  I'm going to come back for all of you.  I'm going to have some cold-ass stares.  That was a crossroad in the kid's life right there.  It could have been...  Johnson, we said we got you closed.  Johnson, you know we can't afford an Xbox.  Oh, he is serious.  Oh, man.  Now he's crying.  He's crying.  What wonderful parents.  Why would they want to do this on Christmas? 
[02:47:30]  That's hilarious.  He's going to afford an Xbox for you.  He is trying to be strong.  Yeah, he is.  He's trying not to be strong.  I got old Sega Genesis.  It's crying.  Yeah.  Terrible.  He's down his face now.  And then we're going to get one of those games for $70 that has Xbox control.  Oh.  And like, like...  Ghetto-ass games.  Oh, a ghetto game.  I got you a Dreamcast.  Oh, man.  How do they just walk away from the kid?  Oh, my God. 
[02:48:00]  They just leave him crying on the floor.  What an awful video.  Merry Christmas.  Merry Christmas.  Oh, he's not being strong anymore.  Oh, my God.  He's got a lot of tears.  Oh, that's it.  It ends right there.  Oh, they had to have gotten it.  You hoped so.  Oh, you got a whole time.  It's 20 likes, 4,000 dislikes.  They just took the Xbox out of the fucking box.  You think they did that?  Yes.  But you can't film that part.  If they didn't give it to him.  No way these people understand the intricacies of a good prank video.  Right. 
[02:48:30]  That it has to like...  They just didn't give it to him.  They should show the Xbox and they should have the guy come in like Fredo with it.  I would bet a lot of money that they had the Xbox somewhere else.  If they didn't, he's out there playing the fucking knockout game right now.  It's like he just changed his whole life, his whole attitude.  Is that knockout game real or are they just immediately pushing that?  It's completely real.  It's for real and thinking.  There's video of it.  Yeah, it's a lot of video.  The press stinks, but this one is actually happening.  Long Island man arrested and charged in seven knockout game attacks.  Wow. 
[02:49:00]  I mean, odds are you're not going to get punched in the head.  I mean, you've got to be realistic about it.  I don't think it's happening on every corner, but it's happening.  You know, there are people out there doing it.  Do they help you after they knock you out?  I don't think so.  I think they just leave you there.  They help you because your pants are too heavy, so they remove your wallet.  Yes, so you can easily get up now.  You can get up easily.  Yes.  And then you get to sign a release too, right?  Yeah.  That works.  Yo, man, we're going to need you to say on camera we could use this. 
[02:49:30]  Just move his mouth on the ground.  World star.  World star.  I saw a video last night where some black guy is standing there, another guy is standing  next to a car, and there's another guy sitting in a chair.  One of the guys just lays this guy out, hits him so hard, his head fucking flies back and  hits the hood of the car.  And no one moves.  It's just like, oh shit, that happened again.  Wow.  We're used to that.  And then the woman who's videoing, you hear her go, world star! 
[02:50:00]  You're on camera!  Yep.  I made it to world star finally.  Did you?  Yeah.  Oh, nice.  For some new videos.  I was offering black people a free boat ride back to Africa.  Oh no, we played it on our show.  Oh yeah, that was fucking great.  World star is my dream, man.  A free boat ride back to Africa.  That one did well for you, that video.  They get so upset.  Justifiably upset.  Yes, they got upset.  You were just kidding.  I was like, I'm not really going to give you anything. 
[02:50:30]  I'm just going to insult you.  You walk away with nothing.  That's an important thing to remember.  Were you nervous at any point?  Of course I was.  I was up for those things.  You only got hit once, right?  Yeah.  Really.  I was at the gas station.  Nearby it.  I had some train tracks in LA.  What are you saying?  He was filming me walking across the street at train tracks.  Because I was wearing the KKK outfit.  And who punched him?  Some Amtrak worker.  He pulled over and slammed me against the fence.  Oh no, some other guy.  Some black, some random black dude just said, oh fuck no. 
[02:51:00]  And then just punched me.  Oh fuck no.  Yeah.  And then when we had the cameras come out, he ran away.  So he couldn't use any of it.  Why couldn't you use any of it?  He assaulted you.  He assaulted you.  A slave trader outfit.  He should have used it and blocked it in his face.  I forgot about that.  That's hilarious.  There he is.  Oh my God.  That's him trying to offer people free boat rides back to Africa.  I never saw this.  Oh, you might have been out that day.  I might have been out that day.  Yeah, we rolled through this video, Ferrari.  The ShamWow guy helped pay for it. 
[02:51:30]  He paid for the whole thing.  Did he?  The ShamWow guy.  How many views did this get?  I don't know.  Let's check out a little again.  Oh my God.  I got to see some of this again.  500,000?  How much is it up to?  Because I don't have 40 acres.  I don't have a mule.  Dude, what is your problem?  But what I can't do...  It's free, sir.  It's free.  And Africa's a wonderful place.  You guys, if you just step on, we could have a great time.  Dress like a gladiator.  Malt liquor.  If you got...  I don't drink.  If you want to get...  All right?  I don't fucking drink.  Okay, calm down. 
[02:52:00]  Kool-Aid.  Say whatever you want.  I don't have everything.  Look at that piece of shit, but there's oars on it.  Malt liquor.  It's called Fantastic Sambo's.  Hey, hey, hey.  Hey, this is my wife.  No, you need to talk down.  Hey, look.  No, no, no, no.  Come on.  Don't get...  Don't get upset, sir.  I'm just trying to be the nice one here.  I'm just trying to help people.  You need to fucking trying to be nice.  Why don't you get this piece of shit off the...  I'm trying to, but I need to fill it up.  There's shackles hanging from...  It's just terrible.  Did you tell them about the basketball? 
[02:52:30]  And this is legit.  Yeah.  Half and half.  That's at all of an interest to you.  Some, we just got people to show up.  Have you ever tasted lion meat?  It's delicious.  Come do this.  The ShamWow guy.  Why would the ShamWow guy want to be...  He was trying to remake that awful movie he made with Bobby Lee, 10, 12 years, underground  comedy.  Oh, God.  And so then he was trying to reshoot a couple of sketches, and he asked me if he could  use all those old ones that I did.  Those aren't mine.  I mean, I don't care. 
[02:53:00]  All right, right.  But then he was like, let's do more.  Did you talk to him about...  You got all likes on that.  There's no dislikes?  No.  There's quite a few dislikes.  There's a million dislikes.  A million.  Yeah.  7,000 likes, 4,000 dislikes.  Oh, I was looking for the red.  Okay.  What are some of the comments?  Oh, let's...  The YouTube comments are always terrific to me.  Yeah.  I was in early with YouTube comments with those old ones, the death threats and stuff.  I became immune to them really early.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Who weren't the Amazing Racist either?  Or it was like one of the first viral videos, and I just know, like, no one's going to do  anything. 
[02:53:30]  I'm going to threaten stuff.  I don't like this.  You don't care.  I would start challenging people on MySpace.  I would look...  I went back to all those old, unread messages, and I'd be like, hey, man, so you said you  were going to kill me.  It's been a year.  Oh, my God.  What are you doing?  I'm just wondering how that's going.  If you're sick or something, I know, you know, time gets slowed down sometimes.  Do they ever respond?  Oh, you'd like that, wouldn't you?  Yeah, sure.  Just any time.  I'm sure you'll call the cops.  Bring it.  Most of the comments are wondering if it's fake.  Fake, not fake.  But asking an American to go back to Europe would not be racist. 
[02:54:00]  LOL.  Bring it.  BQW, that cop is da bomb.  So that's cool.  Yeah, the comments on WorldStar are probably not the most educated.  I love some good fucking nasty comments when you watch a video about a news story that's  a little controversial, and you just go to the comments and go, oh, okay.  It just, it fucking, it goes downhill so quickly.  Wait, did you, I'm sure you talked about that school shooting, haven't you?  Not really. 
[02:54:30]  With Colorado?  Not really, no.  Not really.  Here's the most, the only part that I really love about it.  So nobody will die for the shooter, right?  One person's in critical condition.  Oh, yeah.  And Obama comes out and says, you know, we have to change this.  We have to change the gun laws.  I'm looking at you, because I know you're the one that cares most about gun laws.  Crazy.  The same day, an oopsie drone in Yemen killed 15 people on their way to a wedding.  A wedding.  An oopsie.  Yeah.  Sorry.  Never commented on it.  No, no, no.  We can't trust these people with guns.  They're fucking it up. 
[02:55:00]  It's collateral damage.  15 people just going to a wedding.  Same day.  Regular people like you and me.  But it was Yemen.  You know, a Yemen wedding.  They would have gotten food poisoning at the wedding.  But yeah, you're right.  Where were they supposed to drop that thing?  Yeah.  On terrorists.  No, I understand that.  But was it close by?  They just got the wrong party.  They just messed it up.  They got the wrong information.  They just killed 15 random people.  Yeah, they got them in their cars, you know?  So it was like a little motorcade thing going by.  And a little party goers.  Did it spoil the ceremony? 
[02:55:30]  Whoops.  No, I think they went through fine.  I think it was okay.  They had lamb coming, so.  There's some video of people, like, firing guns in the air at weddings.  And then they just fucking accidentally shoot the people.  I saw that.  Did you see that?  Yeah, I just got shot by his drunk firing a gun.  He was shooting his fucking AK-47 up in the air.  And then he just, like, I guess brought it down and it went off.  And he went, brrap!  And then there's just three people laying, bleeding on the floor.  Where was that video?  Whoops.  Where was that?  Yeah, was that like a...  I think of it somewhere like Syria or fucking... 
[02:56:00]  We saw that one, too.  Did we watch it here?  I went to a Palestinian wedding.  They have a full, like, acted-out sword fight.  Really?  Yeah.  I'm like, how is this a gesture of love?  Wow.  How did you get in there?  It was Aaron Cater.  It was a comic.  Yeah, I know.  I went undercover.  Ah, okay.  Undercover.  I shaved my head.  I pulled my nose back.  You were the sacrificial fucking Zionist.  Yeah.  Is that the one?  Mm-hmm.  Yeah, let's see that.  Oh, really?  Yeah, they're...  I can't see, Sam. 
[02:56:30]  That's how it ends.  Oh, yeah.  They're dancing for a while to Gangnam Style, right?  Yeah, yeah.  They're doing a little Gangnam Style.  And the guy who got shot is considered the lucky one.  There they go.  Just having a little fun.  They've got shitty video cameras.  Aren't they all men dancing or are they women dancing?  Oh, there's a couple of women.  And then...  What a terrible dance party.  A.K.  Whoops.  Just having a little fun.  Sure.  What could go wrong?  Probably nothing, right?  Nothing. 
[02:57:00]  Unless, you know, you're dancing with a fucking...  Whoops.  Rifle.  You have to fast forward, dude, because there's no fucking...  Oh, they...  What do they cube...  Lively cubes it out?  Lively just cubed it out.  Lively cubes out nothing.  That's ridiculous.  Maybe it wasn't them that cubed it.  Maybe it came from somewhere else.  Oh, I saw...  Dude, go to Chaotic.  They showed the whole fucking thing.  He was bleeding like crazy.  Oh, look at the blood pouring out.  A lot of blood.  Oh, they just drag him away?  Yeah, you know, you gotta fucking get the next song that comes up. 
[02:57:30]  Gangnam Style's still playing.  Lively maybe than Cubic.  It looks like...  Yeah, maybe that was a different...  Go to fucking Chaotic.  This stinks.  If you're gonna watch Carnage, you might as well see the whole thing.  In all its glory.  Right.  My leak is way better than YouTube for that stuff.  No, the best one.  I'll show you the best website in the country for that.  Oh, God.  Really?  Yeah.  What?  Why won't you say it?  Why turn people on to it?  Horrified people.  Wait, for what type of videos?  How'd you get to PornMD? 
[02:58:00]  I edited it like...  Look at that.  Sam's stuck on porn sites now.  Just takes you...  Isn't that great?  You're trying to look for fucking ultraviolence and you get to porn?  Yeah, some of these...  It's like it's a two...  Like, they're very connected.  I'm chaotic.  Some of the ones uploaded are fucking fake links.  Oh, that's another one?  Yeah.  Yeah.  It apparently happens a lot over there in the Middle East.  Celebration.  Yeah.  Different song. 
[02:58:30]  No, it's never...  Same wedding.  Same wedding.  Yeah, it's definitely like the same wedding.  The second time, I was like, all right, guys, it's my phone.  It's my phone.  And then...  Oh, my God.  It really is just fucking crazy.  Can you put wedding shooting?  That's irresponsible use of guns.  I think it's perfectly responsible.  Yeah.  People dancing at a wedding.  Better way to do it would use a gun.  Oh, boy.  Maybe we can't find it. 
[02:59:00]  It doesn't matter.  I've seen it, though.  And the guy...  He's on big fucking...  Like a submachine.  We pretty much saw it, though.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Yeah.  Just mowed down three people.  Right.  Jesus.  Whoopsie.  It's wonderful.  I just got back from Europe.  Yeah?  How was that?  To Switzerland and Amsterdam.  It was great.  Amsterdam.  Yeah, it was really cool.  Went skiing.  Oh, yeah?  Yeah.  Did a show in some small town in Montreux, Switzerland.  Was there a big crowd?  Yeah, small.  It was some French festival they're trying to make American.  Trying to make English, excuse me. 
[02:59:30]  Oh, hmm.  Yeah, they dig you over there?  Yeah, it was all right.  Yeah.  There were people from all over the world.  It was interesting talking to people about what they feel about Americans.  Yeah.  I was trying to get as much as I could of that.  Mixed bag, was it?  Well, they don't hate us.  Oh.  That's what I've seen.  They more just, like, kind of laugh at us.  Oh, yeah.  We're kind of goofy.  It's way worse.  They just pity us.  Oh, no.  Why?  What are some of the comments?  When they hear, like, why do you guys keep saying you're the greatest country in the world?  And they were like, in what category?  Education?  Violence?  Like, what category?  Freedom?  None of those. 
[03:00:00]  Are you guys even close?  Oh.  You should tell them that they would be fucking goose-stepping if it wasn't for us.  Yeah, yeah.  We are pretty good at fucking bailing you cunts out.  That's what we're good at.  Time and time again.  Yeah, we're bailing you out when your military fucking fails, you stupid.  Now I'm getting very pro-American.  And another dictator rears his ugly head over there.  Yeah, exactly.  Well, that's what, you know, we would have said.  That's what you would have said.  They would have been like, we don't have a dictator.  It's Switzerland.  Oh, no.  Oh, Switzerland.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Fucking neutral assholes with your banks. 
[03:00:30]  Not very neutral, though, were they?  They're not neutral.  They just fight in their own way.  Yeah.  They fight with economics.  What do they do for fun over there?  Didn't they support Nazis?  Yeah.  They fuck.  They hit a lot of good assets.  They go skiing.  Nazis.  Skiing?  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah, they just took it.  At some point, they realized the Jews aren't coming back for a lot of this.  Yeah, they ain't coming back for this shit.  They just got looked around.  Oh, my God.  Yeah, it looks like the Feldermans were made into lampshades.  I guess it's ours now.  Fuck them in the neutrality.  We're going to bomb Switzerland and take everything.  Open every bank and take all their shit.  Oh, shit. 
[03:01:00]  Enough with Switzerland.  We're not going to get involved.  No, you're not, huh?  What would they do about it?  What was all that artwork fucking stored in those vaults?  And gold and, oh, yeah.  And they didn't give it back voluntarily?  Didn't it have to be fucking stored for?  Yeah, yeah.  They had to have a big settlement for the banks.  Yeah.  So they could, like, give up all these reparations.  They had to give them out to synagogues and stuff all over Europe.  Jesus.  The Jews sure went through some shit.  Amsterdam's pretty cool.  The fucking red light district is weird.  Have you guys been there?  No.  No. 
[03:01:30]  It's too close.  They're in this open window.  So they just smoke or talk on their cell phones or text.  And you just look at them.  But they see you're there.  Yeah.  So they just kind of, like, knock and wave you in.  And it's, like, too much pressure.  It's like Macy's when they start bothering you.  Oh, so you're like, no, I'm just looking.  Yeah.  I'm just shopping.  You can't get your, like, guts up slowly.  Yeah.  Did you get laid out there?  I did, but not with one of them.  Who'd you fuck?  No.  Just some girl.  It's pretty good.  No condom.  Why would you? 
[03:02:00]  You're leaving the country.  All right.  I hope you didn't pull out.  What are you going to do?  I hope you showed a little American ingenuity.  What are we good at?  Planting bases all over the world.  You'll feel my presence for the rest of your life.  Wow.  Yeah.  So if you were to go over to Amsterdam for a red light district girl, are they any good?  Do they look nice?  No, there's some hot ones.  There's some hot ones.  There's some dudes, though. 
[03:02:30]  What?  There's some guys in bikinis that just aren't even trying to cover it up.  Oh, fuck.  Just hairy chested, big, big black dicks in, like, a little bikini.  Oh, my God.  How much that cost you?  Tom Rhodes gave me the best advice.  He goes, I mean, I don't know this per se, but in the booklet it says, I guess I'm saying  in the booklet it says.  Why is Jimmy on the Virgin Atlantic site right now?  Is it just all for them all?  I get some dick.  Why?  Would a back page shut down? 
[03:03:00]  I got a fly?  I don't want to fucking use my passport to get pussy ever again.  No.  No, do it here.  Put it right back in our economy.  There you go.  I have trouble paying for sex now.  Really?  Once you can get laid a little bit, then it's like paying $8 for a Coca-Cola.  I'm just the opposite.  I feel bad if I'm not paying.  If a girl leaves my apartment, I'm like, do you want to take a bottle of water with you?  Do you want one of my Ottomans?  I should do something to make up for this.  I give them cab money just so I can feel like I paid $20 to fuck her.  Jesus.  I don't need cab money.  I live in the building. 
[03:03:30]  Just in case.  Something happens in the way.  Yeah, I'm not comfortable fucking for free anymore.  What?  Really?  No.  What do you mean?  Really?  Wow, that's so odd.  After shows or anything?  Nah, maybe I'll let you.  Hold on.  Jim Norton.  Yeah.  Have you gotten on Tinder yet?  No.  Oh, yeah, man.  Here's why.  Because it goes right to your Facebook.  No, no, no, no, no, no.  What's Tinder?  I like being corrective.  Tinder is what, is what grind, is trying to be straight Grindr.  Grindr's the gay site where it's like, are you close?  Let's fuck.  Oh, how do you know?  Uh, yeah. 
[03:04:00]  Bobby Lee told me about this.  He said it's changed his life.  Wow.  It goes through your Facebook.  It's only people.  No, it doesn't go through your Facebook.  It does, right?  Oh, no, no, no.  Yeah, yeah.  It goes, they see if you have any like friends on Facebook.  Oh, boy.  They can see your real name.  They see your, oh, yeah, dude, you should put your resume there.  Let people find you.  Let the girls who want to fuck you find you online.  You can find me anyway, though.  They know my address is the fucking real Jim Norton at Gmail, and they know that my fucking  Facebook and my Twitter, there's enough ways to get a whole thing.  He just puts it out there.  Good old Jimmy Norton.  Tinder, I've heard of Tinder, though. 
[03:04:30]  I've thought of it.  Somebody, it was funny.  When you're on the road?  I was at the cell of a Dan Matterman, and he's looking at Tinder, he's like, I haven't  gotten one like yet.  Oh, my God.  The anatomy was not doing well on Tinder.  He fucking rules.  That could be a bummer, then.  Yeah, what if you're sitting there, you get nothing.  Yeah, but it feels good to reject girls, also.  You get girls that are sevens and eights, and you go, nah, and it just feels good to  swipe, dislike.  But what do you do if you like them?  If you like them, nothing happens.  If they like you and you like them, a message pops up and says, hey, you guys are into each 
[03:05:00]  other's look.  Holy shit.  I'll leave it on you.  But I mean, my Facebook has a lot of bad pictures of me.  You can upload five pictures.  John Reeb said he pretty much has his resume on there.  Who's John Reeb?  He's a comic.  He won the last comic standing one year.  Oh, boy.  Did he put that on there?  I don't know, baby.  Who fucks you for that?  Who do you fuck?  Esther Koo?  That could be a deterrent, right?  Is she still around?  She's sexy, man.  She's sexy as fuck.  Esther Koo is fucking sexy. 
[03:05:30]  We had her on once.  Yes.  She was really funny.  Yeah, that's right.  I like Esther Koo a lot.  Yeah, we had her on.  Oh, God, that's funny.  She does music?  Yeah.  Good for her.  I'm going to text her.  I wonder how many...  What?  Like, I'm sure the girls are the ones getting all the likes.  Nah, I'm out of the fucking loop.  Dude, there's just no attachments.  I'm just fucking...  Excellent.  Yeah.  I'm not getting on a fucking site like that.  You don't have to do anything. 
[03:06:00]  You just...  One after another, a girl pops up.  You say, yes or no.  And what?  You like...  But I'm sure the girls are the ones getting most of the likes.  And the guys are like...  They don't ever know.  Unless they like YouTube, they won't ever know.  It's like every other internet site where no one's getting laid.  Way more guys than girls on that thing.  I've seen it work for guys.  Yeah.  Like who?  Troy.  I wish he could talk on the air about it.  Yeah, but it's fucking Troy, though.  Exactly.  They're a girl.  It's amazing.  We're going to lay a dollar in a convent. 
[03:06:30]  It's instantaneous.  Instantaneous.  He's like, yeah, dude, I got like four dates today.  Yeah.  It's Troy.  Because you're just going to meet up.  Don't speak so low of yourself.  You're a catch two.  Oh, well.  It definitely works better for a hot dude.  No, Anthony's a catch 22.  Like, yeah, you get the nice house, but you have to listen to him rant after.  Oh, yeah, man.  That's funny.  Tell you what I thought of it, man.  For that, yeah.  You got to go.  That's funny.  Let me show you.  It's so fucking easy. 
[03:07:00]  Oh, don't do this to Jimmy.  He's trying to be better.  Why would you do this?  Oh, then obviously.  That's obviously.  The drug dealers here.  I know.  Open it up.  There's a girl.  Zoe.  She's 20.  I could look at five of her pictures.  Do they show her whole name, though?  Nope, just Zoe.  She's 20 years old.  Oh, she's got a volleyball picture from high school.  Do they have her Facebook page or no?  No.  Oh.  And then you just click like or dislike.  So I like her.  I'm going to click like.  Zoe got a like.  That's cool.  If she doesn't like me, she'll never see that I like her.  She actually... 
[03:07:30]  You can just go, nah.  She'll see that you liked her.  No.  Unless she likes me, too, nothing will ever pop up.  Wait, how does she...  Wait.  Oh, so she just has to kind of find you?  No, it's geographic.  It comes up in your radius.  Yeah, wherever you are in your radius.  So when you go on the road, it'll just look for like a five-mile radius.  Oh, okay.  So Zoe's five miles away from here right now.  You can fucking kill her.  He put a heart on hers and a vomit bag came back from her.  You're not trying to marry these bitches.  Like, you're trying to meet this chick today because you're right near each other. 
[03:08:00]  So she's on this fucking thing.  She sees like Ari is within five miles.  On this fucking thing.  Right.  So, but there's a bunch of guys she's seeing.  So you scroll through and if they both click like, then they're going to be like, hey,  you guys like each other.  Gotta love connection.  If you want to talk, talk.  Right.  And then Ari can be like, hey, I'm not looking for anything except her already right now,  but she has no fucking clue.  No fucking idea.  Hey, I'm in town for three days.  Maybe we should hang out.  How many girls have you met on this?  I fucked...  Excuse me.  I made love to one. 
[03:08:30]  Me.  In Melbourne, Australia.  Tinder dating app, right?  Yeah.  Wait, no.  No, he's in.  You should definitely do it.  There's no way you shouldn't be.  Ari, he's in.  Wow, Ari.  I'm a Tinder boy now.  Jim's got a naughty boy face on.  Yes, I do.  Ari, you don't know what you just did.  I want you to think of me.  He's trying so hard to be a good boy.  I want you to think of me.  When you pull out and wipe away a little pre-com and then just go, ah, fuck it, and put it back  in, I want you to think of me in that moment.  The mistake you make is thinking I wipe away the pre-com. 
[03:09:00]  Jesus Christ.  He's going to be scrolling through at like 4 o'clock in the morning.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Why did I get liked?  Why did I get liked?  Ah, where is he?  Of course I'm not getting any likes.  Fuck you.  You fucking bitches.  Why would you like me?  Somebody don't like fat tits on a man?  Or an appendix scar?  Are you officially on it?  Well, I'm going to download the old...  The old Aperoo?  Yeah, let's open the old Aperoo.  Oh, my goodness gracious. 
[03:09:30]  Ari, I hate you.  Oh, that's great.  But it just shows if you have any like friends.  That's it.  That's all it does.  It doesn't show your activity on your Facebook page.  Nothing to do with it.  It doesn't show your real name?  It won't go to there?  It shows Jim.  Ooh.  A little mystery.  I'm sure that won't bite you in the ass eventually, by the way.  How can you choose five photos?  That's just some link to Facebook.  You will find a girl that will bite your ass.  That's the only thing you'll find on there.  I'm not sure when, you know, this app goes belly up that that info won't be public for  everybody.  Oh, yeah. 
[03:10:00]  He liked a nine-year-old on Tinder.  Can you filter by fatties or anything?  Yeah, exactly.  You could do by age, which I do.  No one over 30.  Don't be ridiculous.  Don't be ridiculous.  What's the minimum age?  So, like, here.  Here's a spam one.  No one over six months.  You're on Ian Watkins' Tinder.  Is there a Tinder, but, like, for babies?  Yeah, exactly.  Kinder Tinder.  If they Google, can I gaga back at them?  This is what happens when you find a match.  It just goes like that.  It just pops up.  Here's a match. 
[03:10:30]  Oh, okay.  You can send her a message.  So, it's Aries' picture in one and a fucking hole in a buddy booth on the other side.  I'm sorry.  Did you get a match?  Yeah, but she's spam.  You can tell the spam when they have, like...  Oh, the spam?  Oh, fuck that.  No, no.  That's no idea.  You don't give up on the stream.  I'll be the spam pussy king.  Yes.  Showing up on the corner.  I was on third and Linux, and you weren't there.  Oh, no.  Every time.  It'll go all the way through it, too.  Now, how do you know it's spam?  It'll say, like, bestdate.com on their picture.  They'll only have one picture. 
[03:11:00]  Oh, exactly.  Wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah.  That's what it's going to be.  All spam.  No Tinder for the kids.  That's it.  No Tinder.  Come on.  It's legit.  You'll love it.  You'll love it, too.  It's legit.  I got to go.  You should be on there, too.  You guys can continue.  I got shit to do.  I'm going to go, too.  What?  You're not?  I got to go, too.  I got a trainer.  Let's all leave, then.  All right.  Can I promote something real quick?  Yeah, of course.  I have a storyteller series online.  Nice.  It's called This Is Not Happening.  There's a shitload of stories. 
[03:11:30]  We put one every Tuesday.  Shitload.  So go to YouTube and just Google This Is Not Happening, let's say, playlist, and you  can find, like, the Joey Diaz one, or Rogan did one.  Big Jay Oakerson did a great one.  Oh.  Yeah, that's a great idea.  Yeah.  Just stories.  Just comics.  The YouTube channel's called This Is Not Happening?  No, it's Comedy Central's YouTube channel.  Comedy Central's YouTube channel, and then you put into the search, This Is Not Happening.  Yeah.  Okay.  Just search anywhere from YouTube.  And you got stand-up New York all weekend.  Yes, sir.  I want to see you guys again.  Absolutely.  You can continue with Sam if you want. 
[03:12:00]  We just got to go.  That's all.  That's true.  Sam does the after show.  I'm going to the gym.  You can go to jimnorton.com and get all my big fucking dates, my big hot-selling tickets, and soon  to be on Tinder.  Yeah.  I'm going to be on Tinder.  Spam.  I want to be in Toronto for New Year's Eve.  Nice.  Maybe you'll see Rob Ford up there.  Maybe.  How cool would that be?  Why should he retire?  He's crazy.  I love him.  Smokes crack.  Exactly.  Smokes crack.  This is after Opie and Anthony live. 
[03:12:30]  Here's your host, Sam Roberts.  Yes, he is.  866-WOW-1-WOW.  Taking phone calls.  It's after Opie and Anthony live.  Ari Shaffir unfortunately had to go.  I love talking to that dude.  He is hilarious.  You all right, Sal?  Hmm?  I'm good.  I hope.  We got this intern over here.  It's like a spider spinning web.  He hasn't mastered getting the headphones unplugged.  He's just sitting there really slowly and carefully. 
[03:13:00]  He couldn't have just waited.  If it was that much of a process.  There's two pairs of headphones plugged into this thing, right?  I plug in my headphones.  Opie's headphones are still plugged in.  And I got this intern whose nose is in my asshole.  Yeah, I was wondering what was going on.  And he's bending over, and he's trying to, like, carefully unplug a pair of headphones  and weave out the wires.  It's like, first of all, it's not that complicated of a job.  And second of all, even if it is, we couldn't wait until, like, 10.50 to just unplug the other headphones. 
[03:13:30]  It's like the last week of his internship, so usually at this point the interns are on point.  Like, they are well acquainted with everything.  Well, I mean, Tyler, come here.  You know I don't like to berate you, right?  Yeah, sure.  That's right.  That did seem, though, a little weird, what was going on over here, right?  Yeah.  At what point, was it when the music started playing?  At what point were you like, oh, shit, now I'm in a weird spot?  It was right when the music was playing.  You were like, oh, no. 
[03:14:00]  He's going to put his headphones back on, and I'm going to still be here with my nose securely  planted in his bum hole.  Yeah, it was at that point that I realized I caught myself in a bad position.  You'd made a huge mistake.  Yes.  You'd made a tactical error.  Yes.  Do you think that maybe, I mean, it's not even, like, in the future, because this is  your last week, I guess, but do you think that maybe going forward you could have switched  the headphones when?  Probably sooner.  Or?  Afterwards.  But not? 
[03:14:30]  Not as I did it.  Right, right.  Right.  You could do it before, you could do it after, but doing it during is just sort of strange.  I thought I had more time.  I was wrong.  So this is your last week of your internship.  Correct.  How do you think the internship did for you?  Let me ask you, Sal made a comment just now that usually the interns are, like, on top  of their shit, and the implication was that maybe specifically because of the issue with  the headphones just now.  I mean, you've got to admit, that was a really silly thing that happened.  Yes.  What was so complicated about getting the wires disconnected? 
[03:15:00]  Tell me.  There was nothing complicated about it.  How come it was taking some time?  Because, well, first of all, I wanted to make sure that I didn't pull the wrong one out,  the one that you're wearing.  Yeah, but you, it was almost like...  And then I slipped out of my fingers a couple times.  It wasn't, you weren't trying to not pull the wire the way you would do it for headphones.  You were trying to not pull the wrong wire the way MacGyver would do when he was trying  to dismantle a bomb.  Oh, was it the red wire or the green wire?  I cannot pull that wire, which, by the way, goes to your passion. 
[03:15:30]  That's a good thing.  I mean, you're basically sitting there going, what's wrong, Mars?  Nobody can hear him.  Nobody can hear him?  He's right.  What do I got to boost him up?  I can hear him in my headphones.  I put walls in his voice.  Is that the problem?  That's what it is.  Come on.  So you think the tonality, not me as a board operator.  No, not at all.  But the tonality.  Put some oomph in it.  Yeah.  Okay, Mars, I'll put oomph in it.  Speak up.  Yeah, but you even sounded passive-aggressive there with Mars.  Like, why not be like...  I'm always passive-aggressive.  This one is?  Oh, this one's always passive-aggressive.  With you.  Is my mic on? 
[03:16:00]  So with others.  I watch them.  Oh, boy.  I'm going to...  Sal, talk to you.  I'm entitled little boy, that one.  He's a what?  Entitled little boy.  He is.  Yeah, that one.  Do you feel entitled?  No, not really.  No.  What about you, Sal?  What do you think Mars is coming from?  You interact with the interns the most.  The only thing I can base this entire...  What's going to happen here...  It was one time I asked Tyler to get some tape.  Why are you laughing?  Because of the simplicity of the task?  Yes.  Okay. 
[03:16:30]  Just to get some tape from Mars.  Okay.  Mars is an engineer.  He might have some tape, right?  That's the only person here I would know would have tape, so I go to Mars.  You mean like scotch tape, right?  No, gaffer tape.  Like particular tape.  But not audio tape.  No, no, no.  It's 2013.  Correct.  Yes.  Not magnetic tape.  So, something happened.  I don't know what the fuck happened.  Okay.  First of all, how can there be a communication breakdown?  So far, I thought we're at the beginning.  We're already at a communication breakdown?  I'm going to let Mars explain, because I don't remember what happened.  Mars just came to me one day.  He got in my face.  It was like, Mars was like, don't you ever let that fucking intern talk to me ever again. 
[03:17:00]  What?  Because did you not have the tape?  I'm sitting in B-Knock, you know?  That's the engineering room.  Yeah.  I'm sitting there, and I'm filling in for someone, and I see, unfortunately, we don't  have a visual element here, but what he does-  Here in the studio.  Here in the studio.  Right.  What he does outside the window, he gestures to me like this.  Okay.  So, he puts like the finger out, almost like Carmela Soprano summoning her maid. 
[03:17:30]  I'm like, what the fuck?  Like, you're the help, like, hey, hey, come here.  And it was intense, too.  He's like, hey, hey, like, I need you.  Wow.  So, then I get up.  And he had this look like, don't you understand?  Yeah, yeah.  I'm beckoning you.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  This should tell you that it's a necessity.  In case you didn't know, I'm an intern for the Opie and Anthony show.  Exactly.  So, come find out.  It's just gaffers tape.  So, then I was like, nah.  And Mars, you're a man with a lot of pride.  Yeah, you don't fucking-  You're a prideful guy.  You don't pull your finger at me.  You don't like that.  Hell no.  And it's also because, I mean, you know, you know that there was a time when we were 
[03:18:00]  on 57th Street.  We were kind of an island.  You were left alone to do what you had to do.  At SiriusXM, you have bosses and bosses, bosses, and bosses.  You have people all day telling you what to do.  Is that right?  That is right.  And you're filling in for somebody.  So, it's not-  It's like you have other shows being like, well, we need an engineer in here.  Yep.  Is that how the other shows are?  I've gotten that.  I've gotten-  A lot of teeth sucking?  A lot of-  Yeah.  I've gotten that, like, twice.  Twice, um, once, I just, uh, calmed them down just by being me. 
[03:18:30]  Charming.  No.  Latino heat?  Don't you fucking talk to me like that.  Okay.  All right.  So, uh, abrasive.  Yes.  Abrasive was the word.  You need my help.  Yeah.  You don't speak to me that way.  Right.  Calm the person down.  Mm-hmm.  I mean, that was cool.  The second time that it occurred, I, I had to pull out the ONA card.  You did?  Oh, hell yeah.  Do you know who I am?  I'm Opie and Anthony.  I'm not supposed to be in this room right now.  I'm helping you out. 
[03:19:00]  What show did you have to say that to?  I'm not saying.  Good for you, Mars.  That was a test.  You passed.  Now, Tyler.  Yeah?  Did you get to ask Mars for the tape that day?  Yes, I did.  Did you get the tape?  Uh, eventually, yes.  Were you met with hostility at first?  No, I wasn't hostile.  I can't.  First of all, I want to say about the pointing the finger thing.  Say it.  Uh, I didn't think I was allowed in that room.  So, I didn't want to intrude into the room.  You're like, hey, you!  I'm not going in there.  That's cool.  So, you are coming out here. 
[03:19:30]  Okay.  So, let me ask you a question.  Yeah.  So, then, what happened yesterday?  Uh-oh.  Right outside here.  Okay.  Well, let's get a little...  Okay.  So, you're saying that you beckoned him with your finger because you didn't think you'd  go in the room.  Right.  You need to talk to him.  You're saying, look, Mars, we got to talk.  I got a job I got to get done.  You got to come out here because I can't go in there.  Well, yesterday, it was just quicker.  But that day...  No, but seriously.  But that day, they had the sign on the wall. 
[03:20:00]  I didn't want to just go barging into there.  Understood.  Okay.  And that's forgotten.  Okay.  So, what happened yesterday?  Yesterday, it was just easier to just beckon him into the hall.  I won't.  Wait.  What happened?  And you did beckon.  I like that you're using the word.  Explain to me the scenario of yesterday.  I forget who was in there.  Oh, Tony.  Tony and Don.  Tony wanted...  Okay.  Tony, for those that don't know, Tony is a big, bigwig.  Yes, he is.  He is the guy...  He designed, for the most part, our studio on 57th Street.  He makes shit happen. 
[03:20:30]  He makes shit happen.  And he's the one who's been brought in here to finally actually redesign the studio.  When Opie and Anthony talk about all the people that they've had to talk to about redesigning the studio and it never getting done,  Tony is the guy that they bring in all the way from Washington, D.C. to say, guys, Tony is here.  Stuff is going to happen.  So, Tony is in there with Mars and Don Wicklund, who you know Wiki by now, he's the guy who, with Tim, is running the channel these days. 
[03:21:00]  Yeah, and he said, get Mars' attention.  I want him in the producer's studio.  And that's Wiki saying that.  Is he the one who's more in charge?  I'm not really sure.  Oh, why don't we, before you get yourself in more trouble...  I don't know which one is which.  So, was he the...  The heavier guy or the slimmer?  The slimmer guy.  Okay, that's Wiki.  That's Don Wicklund.  So, he says, we need Mars in here.  Yeah, he said, literally, get his attention.  I would like him in the producer's studio.  Mars, the problem that I'm hearing is, in the engineering room, that's where all the technology is, right? 
[03:21:30]  Why don't they install a telephone?  Actually, that happened, this last incident happened here in the studio.  But why don't...  Oh!  Yeah, exactly.  Exactly.  I was sitting on that couch right there.  Okay, so wait, wait, wait.  So, Don Wicklund and Tony and our intern, Tyler, with the funny voice...  Okay.  And for me, that's a lot to say, is they're in E-Rock's producer's studio.  Correct.  You're in the main studio. 
[03:22:00]  Correct.  This is after the show.  No, during the show.  During the show.  Okay.  And he's got a...  He now comes around...  Yes, sir.  And through the glass of the air studio...  Correct.  ...points to you and says, Mars, you're needed elsewhere.  Exactly right.  And you've got to be looking like...  What the fuck's up?  I'm looking like...  I would think, Opie, Anthony, Jim, these are the end-all, be-alls here.  Where was he?  I didn't even go around.  I was right there, so basically... 
[03:22:30]  And he made eye contact with me, so I said, oh, okay, instead of going all the way into  the studio, I could just say, hey, could you come out here?  There's some entitlement there, Mars.  I thought so.  I've got to agree with Mars.  There is some entitlement there.  Dude, I honestly don't know if it's entitlement.  What do you think it is?  Tyler is a very good worker.  He's a very nice kid.  He's very good.  He seemed to be receptive when I told him how he could have improved his headphone technique.  Right, right.  Tyler, I don't think Tyler realizes the way he comes off and the way he interacts with 
[03:23:00]  certain people.  But that's entitlement.  I mean, I don't think people who are entitled sit there full well-knowingly saying, I am  deserving of a certain type of treatment.  Entitlement is more like it's something that you're born with.  And you deserve.  It's something that is just innate.  Right, Mars?  Yes, sir.  And it's something that is just, I expect this is how the world kind of works.  I don't even realize I'm doing it half the time.  Exactly.  I don't know if entitlement is the precise word.  I think it's more just he's like, he's like, Tyler is Tyler. 
[03:23:30]  And if he comes off as abrasive, he doesn't even notice it.  You know what I mean?  Right.  Because, because he's allowed to behave that way.  He's entitled to certain, you know, social norms being stretched for him.  Okay, my rebuttal would be, if people don't bring this to my attention, then I'm not aware  of this problem.  We've, we've, I think we've brought it up a few times subtly over the internship.  And it has been brought to my attention.  But before this internship, no one really brings it up to me because they just accept 
[03:24:00]  that's who I am.  You know, a lot of people get their education from colleges.  But I like to think of the Opie and Anthony show and our interns as the school of hard  knocks.  I agree.  This is where, this is where people get street smart.  You know who was a little bit entitled when they came in here?  There's a certain guy in a chambray shirt over there, Sal.  Certain rich kid.  Yeah, a little rich boy over there with a very delicate beard.  And I got beat off.  Sal, fuck down.  Would you say Sal was entitled when he came in here first? 
[03:24:30]  Oh my God.  That's an understatement.  And I'm telling you, Tyler, Sal had to have it beaten out of him, figuratively and literally.  He's still to this day.  And what it is, the entitlement gets replaced with fear eventually.  I was like, okay, I don't know if I'm entitled or not, but I know if I say the wrong thing,  it's going to have really, really, really bad.  So he sits there.  And that's what was going on today, earlier this morning when he was arguing with Travis. 
[03:25:00]  I see it in him when he's in here now, that he sits there.  And even when he's getting emotional, he has to spend seconds, if not minutes,  figuring out exactly how to word every sentence that he says.  Absolutely.  Because he knows there's three sharks and one guppy that are sitting around him,  just waiting for him to screw one word up, to say, well, no, Sal, you said.  And he goes, that's not what I meant to. 
[03:25:30]  No, it's not what I meant.  Now, Tyler, I would say a lesson that I would, oh, my bad, I was trying to put somebody on hold.  I would say that if you'd come in, you just got to treat people the way you would want to be treated.  Think about the perception it might have on.  If you had come in and you'd walked right in the studio and said, hey, Mars, Don was just looking for you.  Then Mars would go, okay.  And he'd go talk to Don because he'd know, number one, you're not trying to exercise any authority that you don't have. 
[03:26:00]  Yeah.  Because, I mean, is there anyone below an intern on the totem pole?  No, there is not.  I think it'd be me.  Maybe Sal, but that's arguable.  And it seems like, you know, you're part of it.  You got your shit together.  You're moving.  You know what I mean?  Not this whole sort of bravado of just being outside a window whenever you see Mars and just giving him the old Tyler beckoning.  Hey, out here, there's some tech shit that needs taken care of, and I'm not going to get my hands oily today. 
[03:26:30]  I'm not getting under that console.  You could pass him a note.  There's many things you could do.  You could.  You could write him a note.  We'll post it.  Yeah.  You know, Tyler's a cool kid, but I think it's also a result of the era that we live in.  You think so?  With the young people, because he's not the only one that I see this, what I'm about to say.  You looked at Sal.  No, other interns.  Okay.  Other interns.  I have interns in the shop as well, and you all do this. 
[03:27:00]  Same age group, going to college, about to graduate.  These fuckers never say hi.  Really?  They'll walk in.  I mean, I'm sitting right in that room in the morning.  Even to you?  And he'll walk in, and he won't say hi.  He wouldn't even give me eye contact.  And I think it's from the texting era type of shit.  They don't know how to communicate verbally.  Even to a superior, who's like, you know what?  It would be good if that guy thought I was cool.  I don't even think of it as being superior, but I'm the first guy in the room. 
[03:27:30]  You know, you're coming into a room that I'm in.  But, I mean, you're more likely to help him get a job than his fellow interns.  You know what I mean?  You have some kind of pull here.  You work here.  You get a paycheck.  But you're not the only one that does that.  I just want to respond to that.  He doesn't say hi?  No, he does.  Tyler Mars wants you to say hi a little more often.  He's a sensitive guy.  I am very sensitive.  He wants to be treated like a human being.  Una persona.  Well, I mean, my response to that would be, I don't want to disturb whatever it is you're doing. 
[03:28:00]  But there's a certain way of keeping your head low.  You know what I mean?  There's two ways of greetings.  There's one way that's a rational way where you can come in and say hi.  There's another way that's totally irrational that drives me fucking crazy because Dennis Falcone does it every day of my life.  And he goes, this is what you don't want to do, Tyler.  You don't want to do what Dennis Falcone does.  Our old school radio pal, Dennis Falcone.  Where every time you walk by him, and this is off the air.  Everybody who thinks that Dennis Falcone is schtick on the air, he's schtick 24 hours a day. 
[03:28:30]  He lives schtick.  I'm not saying it's not schtick because I think there's some real dark shit under all that.  I think he's got a lot of secrets.  I think he's got a lot of desires.  I think there's a lot of shit going on that's buried deep in Dennis Falcone.  But the schtick lasts forever.  And what he does is he doesn't just say hi.  He'll go, hey, Sam, how's it going?  How was your weekend?  What do you got going on?  And it's like, you've got to stop.  What's cooking?  He makes it so you have to stop what you're doing. 
[03:29:00]  Like, you have to.  Or he'll go, hey, Sam.  And I'll stop walking, and I'll turn around, and I'll go, yeah, Denny.  And he'll go, how was the weekend?  And I'll go, that pregnant pause made it so I couldn't get done what I was going to do.  Just say hello.  I'll get to you when I'm, you know, not busy.  It's so phony, though, after a while.  The other day, we go off the air.  Last week, Mars.  Stressful time for all of us.  We go off the air.  We're all running around like chickens with our heads off, trying to figure out what to do. 
[03:29:30]  Mars is trying to figure out what's wrong.  I'm looking for studios to move the guys into, trying to figure out where we're going to go.  And Dennis Falcone, and it's bullshit if he says, I didn't know you were busy.  Because I'm running around.  Right.  Like, it's very obvious when somebody around here is busy, because it's live radio.  So they have this look of immediacy in their face and in their body language that makes it clear to everybody, just back away.  And I'm going around, and Dennis Falcone is going, hey, Sam, you know, if you guys get back on that Mandela stuff, I've got a story.  And I'm like, what the fuck are you doing, man? 
[03:30:00]  I've got shit that I have to get done.  You don't want to be disruptive like Dennis Falcone is, Tyler.  But you can say hello.  And you can just go in and kind of just be cool, you know?  I mean, I do the same thing with Opie, Anthony, and Jimmy.  You know, if they're not saying hi to me first, I sort of just, like, you know, let them have their space.  Your best advice for Opie, Anthony, and Jimmy is to not say a word, keep your head down, and hopefully they won't notice you until your internship is over.  But everybody else.  All right.  See, I've just done the whole thing like that, because I don't, you know, come on a... 
[03:30:30]  The guys are nice, though.  You can say good morning to them, and they'll always say good morning to them.  No, they're nice, but I don't want to, like, interrupt Opie when he's reading his papers, or if they're in the middle of doing whatever.  That's what got you in trouble.  Yeah.  Yeah, because Sal used to come in and be like, Opie, you see them Knicks?  And then Opie, and this is Opie's little trick, and I love it, because I'll play this trick on anybody.  It's a great trick.  I know what you're going to say.  Opie will be like, yeah, it was a good game.  And he'll do the conversation, right? 
[03:31:00]  And then they'll get on the air, and Sal will be in the office, because he's done it to you, too, Mars.  He's done it to me, too.  And Sal will be in the office, or Mars will be in the engineering room, just sitting there, like, and they'll be a little prideful.  And they'll be like, oh, I just had a nice interaction with Opie.  Because everybody, Opie, Anthony, Jim, these are the big guys here.  Everybody just wants to have...  Feeling good about your face.  Interactions, right.  So they're feeling good.  And the minute the mics crack, Opie...  And then you got fucking Sal, who's trying to talk to me about the Knicks.  I'm not that guy's friend. 
[03:31:30]  I'm not his friend.  Dude, one time we were talking about someone taking another day off.  Another big show around here.  Okay, probably Howard Stern.  They were taking a day off.  And then he got into it with me.  He goes, oh, another day?  And I go, yeah, man.  That guy keeps taking days off.  And he's like, oh, he's all with me.  I walk out.  The mic goes on.  I don't need fucking Mars to leave me the house off again.  Yeah.  What does that have to do with my story?  But when he was talking to him, he's like, oh, that's interesting.  Yes, yes, yes. 
[03:32:00]  I thought we were cool.  Exactly.  I have not spoken to Opie about the Knicks since that day.  You're smart.  Never.  And then he drags Sal in.  And he's quizzing him on Knicks trivia.  Like, you don't even fucking watch basketball.  You piece of shit.  Nowadays, he'll be asking me a question in the morning.  I'm trying to get the fuck out of here.  And I'll answer yes or no, because I don't know which way.  Yes, sir.  No, sir.  Yes, sir.  No, sir.  But he's trying to drag me back into conversation.  And I don't know if this is going to be a conversation that's going to be said on the air that I'm bugging him.  You know where you can figure that out?  Look at the newspaper and be like, oh, shit. 
[03:32:30]  It's a slow news day.  I'm not going to be caught in one conversation with that guy.  Because, like, this morning, I go, okay, there's not a lot going on in the news because it's Christmas week.  There's some wacky news stories.  That'll give us, like, an hour.  But I walk in, and Travis and Sal are screaming at each other.  I go, okay, that's a gift.  I knew it.  That was the fucking worst thing.  I heard that door open.  I was like, god damn, is that fucking Sam?  Yeah.  I knew that was going to be.  It was me.  It was me.  Let me go to 516 real quick.  What's up, buddy? 
[03:33:00]  Am I up?  How you doing?  Yeah.  You're in the air.  Yeah.  Sorry.  I just have a really good idea for a promotional, like a commercial for all the holidays.  This intern needs to play an elf because he sounds exactly like one of Santa's little helpers.  That's not a bad suggestion.  Listen, Tyler, this caller thinks you sound like an elf, one of Santa's little helpers.  Have you heard that before?  No, whenever you want.  No, take your time, buddy.  Why rush?  This is one of those scenarios where you should think. 
[03:33:30]  Wait, so he was saying I sound like an elf?  Yeah, I don't know where he got that idea from.  A late elf.  Yeah, you're saying he's...  Well, unfortunately, elves don't make any money, so that doesn't really help me.  No, and also elves sound like fucking crazy, so that doesn't help you either.  They have terrible, terrible voices.  So it's not a compliment.  Do you feel like you've learned from your internship here?  Yeah, I feel like I've learned.  You think it's been successful?  Yeah.  In what way? 
[03:34:00]  Well, I've learned a lot about the systems here, editing.  A lot of technical stuff?  That's important.  Yeah, a lot of technical stuff.  Answering phones.  I've never...  Well, phone screening.  Phone screening, yeah.  I never really did that before here.  How do you feel you are as far as figuring out a good call versus a bad call?  Still getting there.  Still getting there.  Yeah.  How many days are left on your internship?  One.  I hope you're rushing there.  I hope you're trying to get there as quick as humanly possible, because there doesn't seem  to be a lot of time.  Um, and what about, what about the criticisms? 
[03:34:30]  Do you think the criticisms are because you're not a great learner?  Are they because your teachers could have been better?  Uh, or are they just because some things come quicker than others?  Uh, I think some things just come quicker than others.  You don't have any issues with your teachers?  Not really.  I think everyone has been fair in their criticisms.  Who have you learned the most from at this internship?  Uh, it's not Mars, because you only beckoned him those two times.  Other than that. 
[03:35:00]  It'd be, it'd be Sal and Eric.  Sal and Eric.  It's not a lot of information to draw from there.  That is a dry well you're drawing from.  To be fair, Sal is a very good worker, and he does know probably as much about editing  as anyone here, maybe except for Troy.  Yeah, I guess so.  It's true.  Thank you, Tyler.  What about Mars?  Have you learned anything from Mars?  Yeah, don't fucking ask for a gaffer tape.  You want tape?  Go to Staples.  Go fuck yourself.  Yeah.  Uh, no, I mean, I learned that Mars likes judo, but other than, like, learning things that 
[03:35:30]  I could use, not really.  Who taught you how to properly use the call screener?  Uh.  Set it up.  IP.  Yes.  You get that.  The answer is, I don't remember one of the help.  I don't remember who it was.  All right, let me go to 508.  You're on the air.  Nope.  432.  You've got to be quick, folks.  432.  You're on the air.  What's going on, Sam?  How you doing?  Buenos dias, Marcelino.  Hey, buenos dias. 
[03:36:00]  I haven't been listening to the show for almost a decade since the high voltage days.  I've heard Anthony say this a thousand times, how the black man always typical lies  with the white man's voice.  Yeah.  Tyler is the white man's voice that he makes fun of.  Tyler, could you say, I'm off to go read the newspaper today.  I'm off to go read the newspaper today.  It is there.  The nasally and the, you've got to do something with that voice of yours.  I've tried to do something with this voice of mine that's been thoroughly rejected by  many different people.  You, well, you're still on air, so somebody still likes you. 
[03:36:30]  Yours is even more extreme, though.  Okay.  You've got to do like a cartoon voice or something.  Well, they get paid.  Hey, can I say, I want to say something.  Put it on record.  Put it on record.  Tyler, to me, seems to be, he's going to be a successful dude.  Is that because he's receptive to what we're saying?  I don't know about the reception part.  Me neither.  I'm just saying he's got that aura, you know, that entitled aura.  You know why I think that he's going to be successful?  But he's going to be successful.  I got a feeling.  And I told him this, his arguing style and his debate style is exactly the same as every 
[03:37:00]  boss.  Yes.  He has the same look in his eyes.  Yes, exactly.  He's got the same stuff.  Well, if you're going to say that, then maybe we should say, and he's got that like sort  of wiener boss voice, too.  But I think you're going to be successful.  Thank you, Tyler.  Great job today.  Thank you.  And tomorrow, I'll bet we'll be even better.  Well, I won't be here today, so I don't know if that's a shot.  Well, you're here today right now.  Excuse me, tomorrow.  I won't be here tomorrow.  That's all right.  Tomorrow, today's not going so well either.  Why don't you usher our guest in right now?

[03:39:00]  I try to be a lot more positive in here than those guys that come on before me.  Those Opie and Anthony guys.  The doom and gloomers.  Yeah.  Ah, it sucks.  You suck.  You suck.  It sucks.  I told them today.  I was like, you guys are on, they won an award or whatever.  They're one of iTunes' top podcasts of 2013.  Wow.  But Opie and Anthony go, there's 12 fucking other people that are in the top 12.  That doesn't mean shit.  So we're up with so-and-so?  Yeah, yeah, exactly. 
[03:39:30]  You know, I won the lottery.  Fucking taxes.  Yeah.  Two people won.  I got to split this?  Bullshit.  So what's going on with you?  None.  I'm trying to become a rock star.  Yeah.  This, this, I love your, uh, I feel like you've been slowly taking this journey into rock  stardom.  I have been.  You know what I mean?  I have been.  I feel like you started trying to mesh comedy with metal.  Yeah.  When did you start, this is what I was curious about.  When did your rock heroes start to become, like, friends of yours? 
[03:40:00]  Like, when did you start to get to the point where, like, guys from Metallica and stuff?  Mid-90s.  And why was that?  Was that SNL or was that incorporated?  It was definitely SNL.  Yeah.  SNL was, was, the bands would come along.  Mm-hmm.  Where I got to meet Jerry Cantrell, Alice in Chains, and Soundgarden.  Yeah.  Um, Metallica Lars came to one of the shows before he was on it.  Just to check it out.  Yeah.  That's cool.  So, uh, that, that started there.  And then Brian Johnson was from doing stand-up. 
[03:40:30]  Mm-hmm.  Someone saw me doing him doing the hokey pokey on one of the, my DVDs, and then he hunted  me down through that connection.  That's cool.  Dude, it's the greatest.  And is it one of those things where these guys are, like, they're meeting everybody at  SNL, they find out you're a real fan, and all of a sudden.  Oh, I tell them I'm a big fan.  Yeah.  I go out of my way to let them know.  There was never any part of you that was like, I gotta be cool around these guys.  No.  Gotta make sure they know I'm still cool, and I got my own shit going on, too. 
[03:41:00]  No, no, no.  No ego.  No ego.  Good.  Straight up.  I slept over to watch you.  Yeah.  I drove in a van for nine hours from Atlanta.  Because if you're gonna get to meet the guys that you're fans of, you gotta be yourself.  You gotta be that fan.  The first night hanging out with Lars was, I was really nervous.  Mm-hmm.  Not nervous, but he's just so normal.  Mm-hmm.  He's like, dude, we're gonna, what do you got going on tonight?  I saw my best friend from, I grew up with, is coming to, uh, he's like, well, bring him, 
[03:41:30]  we'll meet at this bar.  Mm-hmm.  And we went there, and we're just hanging, no one's bothering him, no one's bothering him,  and we're just hanging out in the bar.  And my friend Phil comes, and thank God for Phil.  Phil's like, I saw you in Brooklyn when we were, like, 16.  He's like, dude, you were up that gig at Lamar East?  Like, yeah.  And so that was...  Yeah.  I'm gonna say that was the first big whoop-dee, that was huge.  Because that's how I...  Lars, Metallica.  Like, now, when I hang out with, like, wrestlers, because I'm, like, the biggest wrestling fan 
[03:42:00]  ever, and I'm getting to the point now where wrestlers are like, yeah, let's go hang out,  and I have to be like, okay, I'm gonna just, whatever their level of normal is, I gotta stay  there.  You know what I mean?  Like, I gotta stay as normal and cool.  And if they start talking about wrestling, I'll jump in.  But if they're not talking about wrestling, I'm not saying a word.  I still do tap dance with that game if I'm around rockers.  I will not go into...  I won't bring up any music whatsoever unless they do it.  Right. 
[03:42:30]  If they...  That's the rule.  If they...  If you're hanging out with me, don't bring up comics.  Right.  Unless you really start what I'm talking about.  And that's another fight.  There's a little bit of an ego and jealousy thing.  So I don't like when they're like, oh, do you know so-and-so?  Oh, yeah, I know so-and-so.  Yeah, we're hanging out with me, though.  He's funny.  Yeah, he's great.  So what are we doing tonight?  I don't want to talk about anybody.  I made this relationship.  And I wonder if that exists in their world.  And I know it does.  I've hung out with rock guys where... 
[03:43:00]  I'll bet it does.  I said, oh, you know, so-and-so, and they get a face.  I go, what's the face?  They go, I don't know, maybe because they copy everything we do.  Oh, all right.  This exists everywhere.  Well, that's like, what's his name from Iron Maiden in...  Or whoever.  I'm terrible with metal.  But in some kind of monster.  I think maybe Dave Mustaine.  Dave Mustaine.  In some kind of monster where you're like, this guy's an icon in his own right.  And he's still fucked up about not being in Metallica.  They kicked him out.  Right.  And after all these years of doing his own thing, 
[03:43:30]  and being Dave Mustaine, and being like this rock god in and of itself,  he's still like you.  I can explain that to you.  How?  That's real easy.  I'll take me, Dane Cook.  You can look at it too.  Yeah, but you're great.  Yeah, but he's worth 50 million.  And that's it.  That's it.  He sells out gardens.  He's doing three nights at the garden.  Case closed.  Yeah.  Show's over.  Yeah, but you were on SNL.  Yeah, but he sold out three nights.  Yeah.  80 billion dollars.  And that's it.  And he's off for the rest of the year.  Right.  I'm plugging it.  Yuck yucks. 
[03:44:00]  Yeah.  You're the funniest guy.  Thank you.  And it's like you got kicked out of being Dane Cook.  Right.  Like you could have been Dane Cook.  I could have been Dane Cook, and I got kicked out.  Right.  Because I couldn't get my stuff together.  But now, Dane Cook went and became this.  And I'm like Dane Cook Jr.  Mm-hmm.  It doesn't matter.  It doesn't matter.  So how do you handle being on, like, long, like,  how do you handle being on a trip with the Hetfields then?  Like, are you sitting there the whole.  So normal.  Or is it just like.  Yeah, it's too normal now.  We're at the point where.  It's at the point where I'm hanging out with Fred. 
[03:44:30]  Yeah.  Where I forget, I honestly, I see a whole different person.  Completely different.  The way I see it is when my family hangs out with me.  Mm-hmm.  They don't see me as Jim, the guy in the entertainment world.  They don't realize it, and they think it's weird when someone comes up to me.  Like, hey, can we get a picture?  Yeah.  We saw you.  And they recite lines.  And they're like, oh, I keep forgetting you do that.  Yeah, you got that show business thing going on.  Right.  Right.  I'm that way with, like, a Hetfield or something. 
[03:45:00]  I just completely forget.  Oh, that's right.  Which is a huge stretch for you.  Yes.  I mean, for you to get to that point is like.  Yes.  A lot of shit must have gone down.  Yeah.  You know what I mean?  Like, that's been developed for a long time.  Our kids grew up together.  Right, right, right.  Our kids grew up together.  Well, so now, because I was thinking about you, like, kind of just sort of developing into  this rock star thing where you incorporate it into comedy, and then you're like, oh, maybe  I'll try to put out a song.  Right.  Because Santa Claus Ain't Coming to Town. 
[03:45:30]  Right.  It's like straight, a metal.  It's a straight metal song.  A Christmas song.  Hands down.  And so as you're thinking, like, okay, I'm going to start with, like, a metal Christmas  song, because that's like, oh, the comedian's doing a Christmas song, and then next you're  like, oh, now he's just doing songs.  Well, Sam, you're pretty much on to, here's the real mission behind it.  Yeah.  The mission was, I am doing a record in January. 
[03:46:00]  I already had it planned.  All this started from me doing this at Orion and metal festivals, where I started doing  the comedy and the metal and mixing together, but I never recorded anything.  Right.  I never put anything out there.  In my head, I always saw this as a monster concert, a monster event.  It's, uh, nothing's ever been seen like it before.  Okay.  It's not Tenacious D, because Tenacious D is phenomenal musicians, but their songs are... 
[03:46:30]  It's tongue-in-cheek, the whole thing.  It's tongue-in-cheek from beginning to end.  Right.  I don't want to be tongue-in-cheek.  So you're not, this is not comedy rock.  No.  Rock, rock.  The lyrics will be comical at times.  Right.  But the rock is going to smash you in the head.  Right.  Case closed.  Yeah.  I'm going to come at you hard.  Are you worried, though?  Because it seems like rock is not, rock is not the thing right now.  Uh, not at all.  Because I know my demographic lives.  Mm-hmm.  I'm going straight for my age group that are all metal, hard rock fans. 
[03:47:00]  Grow up Van Halen, Judas Priest, Dio, Metallica, and now we're stuck to just when the kids are  gone and everyone's gone before we get to listen to that.  I'm going for that group.  Mm-hmm.  And their kids.  Right.  So the music works.  It's the lyrics.  You know, my kids get in the car.  They like the riff of Number of the Beast, but the minute...  Six, six, yeah, six, nine, nine, nine, five.  Like, man.  What are we listening to?  So what are you going to do to stop that?  Like Santa. 
[03:47:30]  Santa, everyone can...  People laugh because they can relate to it.  Oh, my God.  When you started yelling at your daughter about the...  You live in our house.  I realize my stand-up, where I'm at now in life, I've found my niche is family, family, family with a little bit of an edge.  Cosby with a leather jacket.  Yeah, I like it.  And why not incorporate that in the metal world?  If it's working there, it'll work there.  How long did it take, when you decided to be the edgy family guy, that's your comedy thing. 
[03:48:00]  I want to be an edgy family guy.  Is that conscious?  Because that was not you.  And do you have to be like, okay, I'm going to give myself X number of years to make this transition over here?  Here's what happened.  I was struggling with it for a while.  Now, after SNL and Have Baked pushed me in a different light.  Yeah.  I was, all my stand-up was a little bit stoner.  It wasn't full-blown stoner. 
[03:48:30]  A little bit of stoner, a little bit of partier.  That's where I was in the young 20s.  Yeah.  Just got married, all that stuff.  If you look at Comedy Central, it's relationship, it's partying.  SNL and Have Baked pushed me into this, he's a frat stoner.  Right.  And because Have Baked was so popular, and because you look like a stoner.  I look like a stoner.  It's perfect.  And I was for a while.  Yeah.  I was for a while.  But I bought into that persona.  But that's got to be a difficult thing, because you're like, this is guaranteed money.  Like, if I just do the stoner thing, people are still buying Half Baked on DVD. 
[03:49:00]  There's always going to be stoners.  I had a huge, huge Jerry Garcia following.  Yeah.  I was the Grateful Dead, but I also...  And then if I could put on a fucking goat beard or something when I'm out there, that's  just money.  That's it.  But my friends and family were starting to be like, dude, are you really buying into this?  Right.  You're that guy offstage, too?  Like, what's going on here?  Like, your wife has to sit there and be like, are you pretending to be a stoner?  Yeah, like, what are we doing?  What's going on?  And even me, I was miserable with it. 
[03:49:30]  I had three little kids, and I am a family guy.  I'm the solid family guy in my family, and I always put it out there.  So it was a conscious decision.  I struggled with it for years, and then...  Because at first, I would assume your fan base that are all stoners, a lot of them are  probably going to be like, I don't want to hear about your kids.  This is cool.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Right.  This is not cool.  That's right.  And I was scared to death for that.  And in 1998, I went out, did a college tour, didn't take money, just took the door, brought 
[03:50:00]  my dad, brought everyone.  I said, all right, this is it.  If they accept me, then I'll be all right with my demographic.  And the dad shit probably changed everything, because all these great dad stories, all of  a sudden, everybody can relate to it.  Everyone can relate to the dad, and I kept it still edgy enough where it was hilarious.  It's still shit jokes.  At the end of the day, it's a shit joke.  Yeah, he's shitting himself.  That's it.  At the end of the day, it's shit jokes, and he can't remember things, and he insults 
[03:50:30]  people.  Right.  So, but now I don't curse and make it filthy, and, hey, you know, what the fuck?  It's, it's, it's completely, it's what I used to do, which is clean.  How, how, how much does planning stuff like that actually work most of the time?  Because you've been in the business long enough that, like, people come out, and they're like,  oh, I got this plan, I'm going to do this.  Over the next course of the next 10 years, I'm going to do that.  And then you, like, I realized that, like, I had a plan when I was 20, and then 25, I'm  30 now, and this isn't the plan, but, I mean, I'm just rolling, now it's just like, I'm 
[03:51:00]  going to roll with this.  My plans are constantly getting thrown out the window.  Exactly.  Although.  I got to retool this plan a little bit.  I got to retool, the best plan I ever had, I accomplished, which is when I was 20, 21.  I said, I'm going to move to, after I become House MC at this comedy club, I'm going to be  the best feature.  Then I'm going to become, I'm going to blow headliners out the door, and I'm going to become  a headliner.  Then I'm going to do the road.  Now I'm going to go up to New York, get on television. 
[03:51:30]  That happened in six, seven months.  Right.  I got the Uptown Comedy Club.  And then a year or two later, I'm going to be on network TV.  Boom.  Saturday Night Live.  Since then, the plans have been disastrous.  Which has to make you feel better, though, because you know now, when you see these young  guys that are super successful, you're like, just wait.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Just wait, buddy.  But, at the same time, this is what started me again with 2008 when I turned the corner  again. 
[03:52:00]  I came to a point where, well, A, I got to talk to Cosby on my radio show and Jerry Seinfeld.  And they were, Cosby was monstrous on my show.  So, huge, huge influence.  But, I also really sat down and went, you know, you weren't smoking, you weren't partying,  and you weren't this guy, and you had a plan, and just your stand-up got you all the way  to the movie half-baked.  You weren't a stoner.  Yeah. 
[03:52:30]  You were kicking ass.  And then you fell into this, so, if you could do it then, you could turn around and do it  again.  I got you.  And so that...  So, like, you think you were losing work ethic because you're famous now, and it's like...  I got you.  Hands down, I was.  As opposed to just keep pushing.  And now I know...  Being like Ryan Seacrest and just, yeah, I'll do all the jobs.  I'll do all the jobs.  Yes.  And now 2008 has started again.  All right.  It's going to take a couple years.  And I'm going to say right now, 2013, five, six years later, after I turn that corner, 
[03:53:00]  I'm starting to see the results.  That's great.  Starting to see the results.  Yeah.  But that's a long plan.  That's five years.  And it takes that long before...  Like, you have to stick to it.  You have to stick to it.  Quit three or four years in, and it's like, it didn't work.  Same with the rock thing.  I've been trying this for years, and I mean, if you really study me, I did it with the band  on my first DVD, which is called Hardcore.  And before I did that DVD, I was already touring with a band, and we would do a little 
[03:53:30]  more edgier stuff live.  Now, I came to fruition where I'm like, I'm tired of having comedy managers that just don't  get this.  So I went through the music world.  And the music world is what's back in me now.  Great management.  Great music lawyers.  And now I'm like, yeah, no, I'm going for this.  Well, we're out of time.  Dude, this was fun.  It was a lot of fun.  And congrats, man.  Thank you. 
[03:54:00]  You're going to do very well.  And congrats to you.  You're also going to continue to do very well.  Thank you.  But you're going to do great.  Thank you very much.
