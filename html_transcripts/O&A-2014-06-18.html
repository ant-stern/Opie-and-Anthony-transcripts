<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony show began with Sam Roberts' pre-show countdown, featuring a discussion about Pat Monahan of Train, their financial success, the music industry, and Monahan's witty Twitter interactions.  Other pre-show topics included the "walking game" comedy routine, the John and Lorena Bobbitt story, the O.J. Simpson chase anniversary, a humorous montage of Mike Francesa's clueless soccer questions, Anthony Cumia's "E-Rock" saga (with a photo of E-Rock in Rome), a comedic bit with Dan Soter about pitbull attacks (featuring exaggerated and offensive statements), The Situation's reality show and fight with his brother, Kanye West's wedding photo complaints, and the upcoming appearance of Bubba Ray Dudley.  The pre-show concluded with extensive technical difficulties with Anthony's microphone, involving troubleshooting and humorous commentary from the hosts and engineers, including Denny Falcone and Scott Greenstein.  Listener calls and further discussion of United Airlines' baggage handling problems, including a Rory McIlroy anecdote, also occurred during this period.

The main show opened with continued discussion of Rory McIlroy’s lost golf clubs and the high cost of airfare and hotels.  The hosts praised JetBlue's customer service while criticizing other airlines and the industry's consolidation.  A clip of a young Tiger Woods showcasing exceptional golfing skills was shown, followed by a discussion of Woods' career and struggles with sex addiction.  A Long Island plane crash transitioned the conversation to "The Sorrentinos" reality show, focusing on the fight between The Situation and his brother, and analyzing the show's manufactured nature compared to older reality shows like "The Osbournes," "The Simple Life," and "The Anna Nicole Show."  A detailed discussion of "The Joe Schmo Show" followed, praising its unique premise and authenticity.

The next segment extensively covered "The Joe Schmo Show," highlighting humorous moments, its parody of other reality shows, and its comparison to "Windy City Heat" and "The Truman Show."  The hosts lamented the lack of the reveal clip online.  This transitioned into a news story about a transgender teen forced to remove makeup for a driver's license photo, sparking a debate on gender expression and societal norms.  Several callers offered their opinions and anecdotes.

The following segment mocked Flock of Seagulls' 80s fashion and music videos.  The hosts revealed E-Rock's secret Rome vacation, highlighting his secretive behavior and refusal to fill out a vacation request form.  A bizarre call from a listener expressing admiration for Anthony's appearance was abruptly ended.  Bubba Ray Dudley then arrived in the studio.

Bubba Ray Dudley's appearance dominated a large portion of the show.  The hosts engaged in sexually explicit and objectifying comments about Dudley's girlfriend, then discussed his frugal habits, including reusing underwear, and his experiences in WWE and TNA.  They covered his fitness routine, his time with Mick Foley, Jeff Hardy, and Kurt Angle, TNA's attempts at edgier content, Long Island traffic, and an anecdote about Dudley vomiting in a limousine with the hosts.  They critiqued a TNA EC3 promo, discussed Dudley's positive experiences in Japan (including a humorous hotel room encounter), touched upon comments by Jimmy "The Greek" Snyder, and discussed the Don Rickles roast. The conversation also included a discussion of the physical appearances of women from different countries and a former Miss Colorado contestant who entered the pornography industry.  The segment concluded with Dudley promoting his clothing line and stand-up appearances.

The post-show heavily focused on the ongoing microphone problems. Opie, Anthony, Jim Norton, and engineers (including Mars) spent considerable time troubleshooting, discussing potential causes, including Opie's mic settings, cables, and spills.  There were tangents about "Lady Di," Jim Norton's schedule, and a caller’s inquiry about Bully Ray's Twitter handle.  Callers prompted further microphone tests and conversations.  An incident of accidentally broadcasting voiceovers live was mentioned. The segment ended with phone line tests and a cliffhanger about an untested microphone, followed by advertisements.

[00:01:00]  welcome it's the opie and anthony pre-show you know what we do every morning here on the opie  anthony channel count down the moments before opie anthony begin for another grand day  of historical legendary radio 866 wow one wow 866-969-1969 here's the exciting thing if you call that phone 
[00:01:30]  number you can be a part of it you can be a part of counting down those very moments we'll uh  try to make an educated prediction a hypothesis if you will as to what opie and anthony are going to  talk about today as well as get into everything that went down on yesterday's show of course  a very a very rare first segment guest on yesterday's show the guy from train pat the lead singer he came 
[00:02:00]  straight from the airport and it was it was cool to see him because he wasn't doing a press day  yesterday he was coming from the airport he's coming into new york to like master a record one of his  songs or something like that he was working on the album yesterday but he said you know what i missed  opie and anthony on my press day so i'm gonna come in i'm gonna drive straight from the airport well  i'm a big star so i'll be driven straight from the airport to the sirius xm facilities uh where i'll be 
[00:02:30]  able to do the opie and anthony show and he was a great guest uh because he doesn't mind i think he's  been in the music business long enough that he's not worried about saying the right thing all the  time he's not like he's not worried about his career disappearing for no reason like he'll he'll  he'll talk to you like a real person if you ask him a question he'll actually answer it he won't try  to give you the right answer he'll give you you know the truth so we kind of talked to him about 
[00:03:00]  the way because he's been trains been around for 20 years so we talked to him about the way bands  nowadays in 2014 are making money let's go to track three you banked some money off uh off a  commercial that that train song was everywhere for oh man especially in this area drive by him with  the yankees games yeah or the ford commercials during the yankee games yeah you guys were smothered  in that song sorry about does that pay well you don't have to you know sometimes it uh it pays  the record company really well it's a good time for them to get their their money back and 
[00:03:30]  everything right but uh when you recoup the money that you're using from a record company yeah it  ends up meaning a lot yeah that's good if they could make their money back that way and then you  guys can start actually making money off of a deal instead of yeah you know paying back the man i do a  podcast and and i've had a lot of musicians and pro athletes etc you know i'm not i'm not good like you  guys are but i faked through it and uh one of the most interesting podcasts i did was two radio guys 
[00:04:00]  from columbia records right because i got to talk to them about what what it's going to be like for  these kids coming in and is there any future in radio or in you know record sales or right record  companies i don't think you know and you know they're very optimistic about it because they have  great jobs they work radio and radio they feel is going to continue to have to matter for a lot a lot  more years but you guys make your money differently than you know guys we make our money in a lot of 
[00:04:30]  different ways but you're not touring is basically exactly where you end up and and a lot of record  companies did 360 deals with their artists from you know signing probably 10 years ago to now  that they make you give them part of your t-shirts holy god they're not getting enough  it's crazy that i mean because in my mind i would think that's where the artists can make their money  back on touring on t-shirts on stuff like that but the the music people know that now so they're 
[00:05:00]  like no no no no i'm gonna get a taste of that and taste of that and a taste of that that's why these  musicians are broke billy squire's got no kind of cash left i'll bet you i guarantee you that  uh he got in also to the uh the way twitter responds to him now which i thought was very  interesting because when train first started like when drops of jupiter was the shit when that was the  song there was no twitter around it wasn't like people were tweeting being like you know i love 
[00:05:30]  drops of jupiter like you didn't have any access to the artist really so uh the fact that train has  been able to kind of move with the times and still put out pop songs is impressive let's listen to pat  talk about twitter do you guys ever get the hey man you sold out oh sold out i just read one the  other day that was like it's official the band that wrote uh meet virginia and drops of jupiter  is dead you know like oh that's sweet all right so i did this thing i do this thing on twitter now 
[00:06:00]  where if somebody writes something like here for instance this is what happened last week literally  some guy wrote train's new album coming out is called i don't know how he got this many letters  on twitter uh it's called uh bulletproof picasso i like the original name train is a shit in a barnes  and noble toilet because it was a funny enough tweet i was like hey i know what i'll do all right i'll 
[00:06:30]  retweet but i'll change a couple of the words right where i turned it into train uh i like the original  title train is awesome right and then i just wrote thanks buddy oh so that all of our fans are seeing  this and then he writes oh my god train just made me look like a total asshole to my friends  so it's like my new thing i'm gonna do it's just a lot of fun i sit in bed and just laugh  he can't possibly reach as many people anyway no and he was like you won this round 
[00:07:00]  i'm pretty sure i'm never gonna get you next time yeah no this is i think you're done with him  you're not gonna be searching him out every time that's funny wow what a spinal tap type review that  was shark sandwich a simple two-word review shit sandwich it's nice to know it affects everybody  the uh the twitter response and it uh you want different levels of it too because you know we on  the show feel it but pap and train have millions of followers and you wonder if it if it just gets 
[00:07:30]  when it gets to be that much because anybody who has that many followers anybody who's that much in  the public spotlight is it's gonna get you know a hundred thousand times more positive response and  negative response that's just the way it works so you wonder if when there's that much of anything  you just kind of stop taking it seriously it's either that or it drives you crazy i would assume  uh we continue on with pat and again this was amazing because it was happening first segment like  this was the segment where opie and anthony kind of you know bounce into the show figure out the flow 
[00:08:00]  of the day they're waiting for their food to arrive but they jumped in head first yesterday and this was  a good sign of the energy of the show because it picked up here in this segment uh first segment  and never never went down sure uh about the walking game from pat these salty you know comics they do  and i'm sure jim plays this game too it's called the walking game you know about it no i don't where 
[00:08:30]  they just go like all right we're in tulsa there's 30 people we're four comics let's see who can make  more people leave oh shit walk the room yeah right right yeah those guys do that yeah that's rude  they certainly have versions of that yeah you just start saying shit right there's nobody wants they  are not even you it's odd because there's got to be a confidence in your material to go up there  every day and and know that even if you bomb the material's still good go up and do it again yet 
[00:09:00]  they're the most unconfident people when they're just hanging out comics they're they're fucking  weirdos for the most they're extremely strange i love that you can tell that pat is a fan of what  we do on the show and what we're fans of on the show that he's a feel like that he enjoys that dark  comedy because when you hear train you think of like you know you smile yay so sister you gotta smile  you go yeah yay it's train you don't think like oh i love watching comics tell jokes 
[00:09:30]  that are so offensive people have to leave the room you go yes look i knew i was smiling for a  reason that's exactly what i was attracted to one more clip uh from pat monahan from train from the  first segment of yesterday's show uh as he talks about john and lorena bobbit the other one was  that snipped the dong yeah oh that was bobbit bob john wayne bobbit john wayne bobbit what was her  name though or no like oh yeah five years on yeah yeah lorena bobbit lorena bobbit that's right 
[00:10:00]  there was so many odd stories imagine back then from long island that's really you got a dark spot  that you can't get any light to that and drove away with it and threw it out the window and they  found they found it can you imagine your dick is somewhere else and they actually say good news we  found it found your dick my yeah my uh could you imagine hey buddy hey you're the guy that lost the 
[00:10:30]  dick right yeah we found a dick oh my god i mean it might not even be your dick don't get excited  i mean we found a dick a dick yeah i think we can assume it's yours at this point but they attached it  and it worked fine and then i think he got the surgery where you could pull a little out oh you  know about the surgery where you could pull a little out cut the tendon cut the tendon or the  ligament over there and you could pull it out a little bit like a like a cord in a vacuum cleaner 
[00:11:00]  that sounds great until you're like fucking 60 70 years old and gravity's been tugging on that  ligamentless dick anyway i mean john bobbit tried to have a career after that he did porn movies right  after that but still and i think that was to completely overcompensate like he was like oh  from this day forward i'll be known as that guy who was in the news but the guy in porn with the big  dick but it's no you're always going to be you're that guy who got his dick cut off right hey how'd that 
[00:11:30]  happen anyway hey what'd they do what they would they sell it back on tell me about it like there's  nothing else to talk to him about uh it's interesting though that we're getting to that time where  that was like 20 years ago the oj we didn't touch on it much on the show yesterday but the oj white  bronco chase was 20 years ago yesterday and if you ask me i've been looking at that case  for the last 20 years and if you ask me i think the jury got it wrong but i think i think oj might 
[00:12:00]  have done it that's what i think nick in uh durham oh hey sam um with uh train being the house  band for howard stern at his birthday show and they've had a long relationship i wanted to know  did you get a sense that there was any tension because of that relationship and and and how well  pat knows howard and vice versa no i don't think so i mean i think pat's smart enough to know that  he shouldn't be getting involved in other people's uh feuds and obie and anthony don't care 
[00:12:30]  if people want to be friends with go on howard's show and that's never bothered them i mean they're  people who've done our show for years that start doing howard show there are people that have done  howard show for years that have done our show for years it really doesn't bother uh opian anthony at  all i don't know if there's some of that coming from the other side but i know for us i mean pat's  been on the show before trains performed in our studio before uh and they're always good guests we  love those guys so uh it didn't it doesn't really come up at all uh let's talk about some of what may 
[00:13:00]  be going on today here on the ob and anthony pre-show 866-WOW-1-WOW is the phone number we go  to justin in jersey what's up justin hey sam how's it going man good hey uh i just wanted to make you  aware of a mike francesa clip from yesterday uh-huh jesus christ you went on for five minutes asking  if soccer players kick with both feet it was unbelievable oh and uh three and a half months  until october that's right get excited i was that we do have a montage clip of that from yesterday 
[00:13:30]  that i was watching this morning mike francesa i mean when opian anthony try to figure out how  soccer works on the show i don't think that's a big deal because opian anthony are not sports guys  this is not a sports show it's an entertainment show it's a comedy show mike francesa is on the  radio because he's a sports expert and yes yesterday there's a whole montage that we'll go through  of mike francesa asking childlike soccer questions he did indeed ask are there any soccer players that 
[00:14:00]  kick with both feet um he asked uh don't you think that they should put the clock up how do  you know how many minutes are left in a game uh he i mean just question after question of somebody  would obviously not familiarize himself with the sport whatsoever which is strange because you would  think if you hosted a sports show you would go out of your way to say oh you know what world cup  fever is infecting the nation let me go ahead and read some of let me find this soccer rule book and at  least read the rules of the game let me watch two soccer games and try to figure this out but no 
[00:14:30]  not for mike francesa uh ant was infected with world cup fever you saw during the stanley cup finals  ant started bleeding ranger blue as a way to i guess cure himself of the fact that of the depression  that would go along with his rangers losing he's decided to take up world cup soccer is his hobby let's  listen to track two speaking of africa i guess uh oh yeah world cup motherfucker you're a world cup 
[00:15:00]  guy now i bleed red white and blue you're a world cup guy world cup go motherfucker yeah gonna  gonna knock you right the fuck out haha enough gonna jokes on twitter yesterday holy fuckaroni  p radovich he wrote me back because yeah i was in a bar hanging out drinking watching watching the  game with the you know rest of the people i watched i watched a little bit oh yeah it was all right  if that that's my right it was just okay p radovich is mad though because he he was we were talking 
[00:15:30]  about soccer yesterday and he was so mad he he texted me and said something like you're killing me  with this soccer thing so then we put him on the phone he works for cbs sports yeah and he's like  come on just at least give it a try give it a try give it a try it's just okay and he just okay he  texted me this morning please tell me you watched that game oh i did i watched yeah so yeah yeah you 
[00:16:00]  watched and watched come on i even watched the winning goal that was exciting right there it sure was  fucking kicked it and it went in so you know for two minutes the game was kind of fun yeah i don't i  don't know man and i think a lot of people that are running around with this soccer fever are lying  because come on i was at a i was at an outdoor not even a restaurant i was just getting a plate of food  but i'm right i'm outside and i'm right next to uh another restaurant with outdoor tables and there 
[00:16:30]  was a bunch of uh 20 somethings if i had to guess they were about 24 25 and and and the the game is  on in the restaurant but they can't see the game but they hear some kind of cheering yeah it was early  on i i didn't see the whole game i'll be honest with you and all of a sudden there was a little  cheering so maybe it was the first uh u.s goal yeah and the one girl it was like out of a skit she  goes i love soccer and then everyone around the table is like yeah me too i love it i love soccer too 
[00:17:00]  and i'm sitting there like you don't love soccer you know you don't think it's just a cool thing  to do now is to say i love soccer it is of course because the world cup is going on but the more i  was thinking about it when the stanley cup finals were going on everybody was into hockey all of a  sudden and when the world series happening everybody's into baseball all of a sudden i think that happens  with every sport no matter when the championship series is happening it's the 
[00:17:30]  percentage of people who are fans of that sport just go up 150 000 fold if that's even possible  but i think that's all it is like you know everybody gets caught up in the in the fever of the championship  um we continued to try to explain soccer this time with the great comedian dan soter in studio later on  in the show henry in atlanta henry go ahead sir hey guys i know i mean soccer's just like hockey  you gotta set up your score opportunities you got everybody's working i just hate it it's so cool 
[00:18:00]  for football fans and everything to say that soccer's lame and gay i've fucking heard that  soccer defensive well it's a good sport it's just like hockey on a bigger scale and if you got three  people trying to score you know it's hard to do we even know the net is big there's constantly people  trying to not let you score that's what's so hard about putting it in a two-car garage oh excuse me 
[00:18:30]  why don't you just why don't they just pick the ball up run with it and run into the gold  and then that would be too easy oh then i don't understand the rules henry i'm football is a car  garage i don't i just uh i don't know i'm not trying to i'm not trying to be too cool or any of that  shit no one has been able to explain those guys that had that argument back and they football 
[00:19:00]  soccer's for bags if any one of them would have said it's cool then they look like a  a queen yeah i wouldn't say yeah we don't i wouldn't say it's for fags or any of that shit  and you can't compare american football to soccer obviously it's two oh two different completely  different sports i appreciate the fact that you know soccer is played around the world so the  competition is uh that that much greater i think that's all it is i guess dan sorter didn't have  much to say in that clip whoops let's go to uh dan in maryland what's up dan hey how's it going 
[00:19:30]  good buddy hey i heard like on monday's show i think you were trying to get a hold of like  e-rock in europe and i was just curious did you guys try to call the other hotel on tuesday  well we did not not yesterday's show was too busy for an e-rock update uh we haven't spoken to him but  this was the big news breaking yesterday afternoon in the e-rock case if you go to anthony  cumia on twitter as a matter of fact we'll retweet that follow at o and a show on twitter and we'll

[00:21:30]  girl and she was thrown out of a kfc kfc had to apologize we got into the story uh with dan soter in  studio was a it turned into a classic bit in the making and it's fun listening to the show like when  you know that there's a bit that's happening as you're listening that is going to go down like this  is one of the classic bits dan soter i think uh he made his mark yesterday with this pitbull bit let's  start it with track nine kfc i think you uh you really fucked up on you really fucked up you took a 
[00:22:00]  little angel that is attacked by a pitbull by a monster yes you know pitbulls are friendly by nature  and i don't appreciate that you say they're all evil they have a bad reputation as being vicious but  it's just how you're raised it really lies with the owner they're one of the most lovable dogs  shut it they're gonna call though every time we say that every attack they're dialing right now  who who raised the dog you know they're known to be the most lovable i myself leave my children 
[00:22:30]  alone with our pitbull you should say my pitbull with my two-year-old yeah they've had that with  my two-year-old yeah yeah never had a problem the most vicious animals on the face of the earth  they're the velociraptor of this millennium what's i can land alligators  fucking walking around what's their fucking death rolling on little girls what's their bite  equivalent to like their bite grips equivalent to like those things that drive pilings in 
[00:23:00]  their fucking jaws can that's a fucking myth busters fact  say the phones yeah my people loves babies yes the administration uh posted a photo showing  victoria's smiling shyly in spite of her facial scars and cartoon decorated eye patch writing  does this look scary to you my sister was texting me photos of her pitbull next to her baby all day 
[00:23:30]  yesterday as if to say hey see this you guys were wrong which i mean to me they just look like  before pictures to a tragedy i couldn't agree more with what was being said on the show yesterday let's  uh they continued the pity talk with the pities and kids that dog was fucking latched onto her face  like a monster but it's not the dog's fault do you blame the gun or the person aiming it you blame the 
[00:24:00]  person you know what's her grandfather hiding what are we not learning about her grandfathers yeah  yeah yeah what are the living conditions of these dogs they're very sensitive the dog was only  responding to something that they perceived as a threat an adorable little girl a harmless little  cute girl and perceived it as a threat and by the sixth death shake  by the time it wrung out all life in her eyes 
[00:24:30]  can we get one of these guys though you know anthony spend an hour with my pitbull you change your ways  change your tune i'm gonna bring one into the studio yeah you can just fucking chew down and pet it  you know it's time to close my why don't you spend an afternoon with the way you guys say it makes 
[00:25:00]  it sound bad but pitbull's a good dog i've never seen a pitbull just being gently walked the child made an  aggressive move it must have done something like scratched its ear or or maybe smiled and showed  those baby teeth that it would soon knock right out of her head right i was having an argument with  some of the people who work here as to whether or not this theory was true and they were like well  any dog could be aggressive and i'm like yeah but if you can do a fight with a poodle if a poodle is 
[00:25:30]  attacking your baby you can kick it in its head and it's no problem you can't do that to a pitbull  it'll bite your foot off let's go to snowy in michigan what's up snowy hey samuel how are you doing  good yeah but the first thing that shocked me about this whole story was wasn't the kid visiting your  grandparents i know there's dogs that attacked it attacked the kid yeah i think so like if it's the  grandparents it's like it's a a stranger it did like the grandparents i'm sure thought it was a good dog 
[00:26:00]  i'm sure i'm sure they call the dog muffin and fluffy or something like that right  uh what what does make pitbulls a little more death muffin about the whole thing about pitbulls  being you know any dog attacking yeah but i think pitbulls i think one of the strongest jaws or  stuff like that and yeah they're built for damage the freaking like you know probably grab the kid and  plug them around like a chew toy or something i mean like you said before if a if a if a poor  the midside dog go flaky you probably could kick him move away at pitbull you're not going to scare 
[00:26:30]  off of nothing it's like saying like no i just like to thanks snowy i just like to drive a tank  like that's just the car i like to drive and sometimes i accidentally fire the big gun off i  don't know what i'm doing but i just like i'd like to drive the tank it's just a car it's like any other  car um a lot going on on today's show aside from the mike francesa montage that we'll definitely get  to uh of course there's a big story about kanye west being mad that annie lebowitz wouldn't do his  wedding photos and uh saying that he spent four days on his honeymoon having to retouch his wedding 
[00:27:00]  photo which i mean it's just just keep it to yourself kanye you know it's so hard to defend it's  impossible it's impossible also making his big return to the opian anthony show today bubba ray  dudley the former bubba ray dudley now bully ray uh i don't think he's been on since oh and i have  been on satellite radio really but he was a regular uh back in the old days when he was a wwe superstar

[00:31:30]  Oh, my God. 
[00:32:00]  Oh, my God. 
[00:32:30]  Oh, my God. 
[00:33:00]  Oh, my God. 
[00:33:30]  Oh, my God. 
[00:34:00]  To rest for your radio, a new hope begins to rise.  Opie and Anthony are radio shock jocks known for setting up outrageous stunts.  People sure are listening.  Two Long Island natives who together would one day change the world as broadcasting's greatest duo.  Oh, my God. 
[00:34:30]  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  It was beautiful.  Oh, my God.  After 20 years, these children of the 80s have arrived.  Their hugely popular radio show is not just in New York anymore.  Opie and Anthony show up.  Opie and Anthony show up.  Opie and Anthony show up.  You're out of the show.  You're out of the show.  You're out of the show.  55-55-gallon drums and whiffle ball bats.  Oh, my God.  You're in it.  You're pushing in until you're comfortable.  From mayors to mayor.  It was an April Fool's hopes by two radio disc jockeys.  With bottle rockets and bra bombings. 
[00:35:00]  And wieners and pigs.  Opie and Anthony got their hands on the photo and tweeted it.  Two men that have taken a box of cocks further than any.  Well, these people will definitely stop.  Guaranteed.  Lift up the cocks.  They've met friends along the way.  Jim Norton.  I have a raging heart on right now.  Can I please put my dick in your donuts?  And through fines, scandals, suspensions, cancellations, and terminations.  It's the one show that remains unscathed. 
[00:35:30]  Striking fear into the hearts of management everywhere.  Comes a radio show that after 20 years remains above all else.  Real.  This is the Opie and Anthony show.  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road.  This is the Opie and Anthony show. 
[00:36:00]  I don't know.  Oh, boy.  That is a bad one. 
[00:36:30]  What happened between yesterday and today?  Does that help?  But then that lowers me.  No, it lowers everything.  Oh, Mars!  Check.  One, two.  Hi, everybody.  Isn't it?  It's horrible.  It sounds a little weird.  It's distorted and way basic.  Listen to that.  Hi.  How you doing, everybody?  I'm in a tin can.  There's no processing on it.  If you need to know.  What happened?  You have no processing on your microphone.  Where's Mars?  Is he hiding?  Is he doing a walkabout?  He's doing a walkabout. 
[00:37:00]  He's doing a walkabout?  Uh-huh.  He was just in here.  Where is he?  He reattached the original mic, I think.  Well...  I don't know why he did that.  Just go back to what we had yesterday, please.  Everything is going well.  We had a pretty good show yesterday, and now we have to start with this shit.  So he put it through my button, so now I can use my button, but now the mic stinks.  Here comes Mars.  All right.  Let's see what happened.  In the thrilling, what's going on with Anthony's mic?  Oh, Mars, this is bad.  It's really bad. 
[00:37:30]  This is bad.  What happened?  Did he test it before the show?  Yeah.  So right now...  Yeah.  Can you talk on mic?  At least maybe...  We can what?  Can you talk on mic?  At least maybe we can make radio out of this.  All right.  Yeah.  Let me hear what he has to say.  What do we need to do?  Well, we needed to give you control back to the mic.  Yeah.  On and off.  I'd rather...  You see, if we have a choice, rather have good mic, no control.  Right.  Better than bad mic control.  Right.  What is it right now?  Oh, my God.  Listen to this.  Do you hear this? 
[00:38:00]  Hey, everybody.  Isn't it Tim Canning?  Can I give you compression right now as we speak?  Yeah.  I'll give you fucking compression.  Give him compression.  Hey, give me compression.  What?  Does it sound any better?  No.  What are you doing?  I don't see you doing anything.  I have someone else.  What?  I'm trying to give you compression.  Oh, someone's in the other room doing something?  Oh.  Does that sound good?  Wow, wow, wow.  No, it's...  Listen.  Listen.  I hear it.  You hear that?  Yeah, I hear that.  Ah, oh, meh.  I sound like a kazoo. 
[00:38:30]  Just to let you know, listen.  It's really difficult to replicate the room when you're not here.  What?  That means I have to open every mic, and I did that this morning.  Uh-huh.  I got some people in here.  Oh, boy.  Who?  Helen Keller?  Yeah, if I named the people, you'd be like, oh, boy.  Another engineer.  Yeah.  Denny Falcone.  Oh, Denny Falcone.  So we were trying to work on the mics, and...  Well.  It seemed like that one worked better than the other one. 
[00:39:00]  Oh.  So we tried to use this one, but...  Well, I don't think so.  Okay.  So I'm going to take away that mic.  Yeah.  And you won't have any control.  Yep.  That seems to be what we got to do, right?  Okay.  So in the meantime, why don't we take that mic off that clip, like right now, and I'll  take this off.  Can we check...  We got to turn them off first, because you want to fuck it up.  There we go.  All right.  Give me that fucker. 
[00:39:30]  Oh, you got to turn that mic off, O.  What?  That mic right there.  What happened?  Guest mic.  What?  Flip that guest mic off.  This one?  Yeah.  All right.  All right.  Now...  Put this on.  Now give me that cord.  Don't turn it out yet.  Put this off what?  Why are you doing that?  You said...  I need the whole cord and everything.  Yeah.  Yeah.  That's how we work it.  Do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do.  Oh, boy.  Oh, boy.  Yeah, plug it in.  What happened?  There we go.  Oh, the other way. 
[00:40:00]  There we go.  All right.  There we go.  Unravel it.  There we are.  Now give me that.  There you go.  Loop it over there.  Oh, shit.  Oh, no.  Here you go.  Yeah, there we are.  Here you go.  There we got it, boy.  Oh, boy.  A little too loose.  Cut that.  You got a knife?  Of course you do.  You're a Puerto Rican.  There we are.  They love their knife.  Good snip.  There we go.  Come on.  How has this been working every day and now it's all tied up?  It happens all the time.  What happened?  Whenever you twist-tie wires, Mars, you will have to get some slack.  That's the...  Yeah.  All right.  Turn on the guest mic. 
[00:40:30]  What?  I'm...  The guest mic on.  I'm returning emails.  What happened?  The guest mic.  We need that.  Oh, I'm sure.  There we go.  That's...  Is that it?  That's better.  Sounds much better.  That's better.  Okay.  All right, everybody.  We're back.  And better than ever, we're back.  Together.  We're back.  We're back.  Yeah.  It's just nonsense.  I hear ya.  Our agent has...  Wow. 
[00:41:00]  Is in the middle of dreamland.  He has no idea what's going on anymore.  Where he is.  And he also sleeps well at night.  He really shouldn't.  He should just wake up every night screaming, I'm stealing.  Right.  I'm stealing.  Yes.  He has absolutely no idea what's going on with his guys.  Oh, boy.  The company doesn't give a fuck.  They just don't give a fuck.  Wow.  That was a crazy few minutes right there, huh, guys?  Yeah, that's great. 
[00:41:30]  Shit.  I should keep our listeners.  Yeah, off the heels of yesterday, I think they...  There is so much competition now, but I think if we start our show with studio problems  every day, that'll keep them.  Man.  That'll keep them listening.  Yeah.  You can't talk to one person in the public eye without finding out they're doing a podcast.  Everybody is.  Every single fucking person is doing a podcast.  I bet their mics work, too.  Yeah, I'm sure they do.  I'm sure they don't have issues like this.  Turn it on.  So where were we? 
[00:42:00]  There is absolutely...  Oh, that's right.  We were nowhere because we couldn't start.  We were right at the starting line.  Right.  You ever watch a race and it's a standing start and all of a sudden they go...  And everyone takes off and there's one car just sitting there.  That's us.  The driver frantically trying to figure out what's wrong.  That's us.  That's our show.  That's why...  Whatever.  They've heard it all before.  Nah, nah, nah, nah, nah, nah, nah.  Just play back some old tapes. 
[00:42:30]  Nothing changes.  Shitty agent.  Shitty company that doesn't really give a fuck.  Because supposedly we do very well for SiriusXM.  You would think they would step it up and go, wow, maybe we should make sure they could broadcast  every morning right from the get-go.  Yeah.  You would think that would be at least something they would want to do.  You'd think.  But for whatever reason, they don't care.  They just don't care.  It's amazing to me.  It's on autopilot or something.  It's amazing that you don't care.  It's on autopilot heading to a mountain. 
[00:43:00]  You think?  Yeah.  A little bit.  I know they want to supposedly do all sorts of renovations with the studios around here.  And now they're saying January.  Remember Bladder and...  What was his name?  Who?  The Wizard?  Radio Wizard?  Who the fuck is he?  Who?  They've been gone a while.  Yeah.  And I remember when they said, relax, man.  We're getting to your studio.  You're going to have a brand new studio by October.  Mm-hmm.  That was October of last year.  And I kind of gave them a little shit. 
[00:43:30]  And they're like, you know, you got a bad attitude.  I'm telling you it's going to be done by October.  Oh, sorry.  That's right.  You missed.  It came close, but you missed.  So now the October turned into what?  When did we go away?  May?  So then they said, when you guys are, you know, gone in May, we'll get you a brand new  studio.  Now, May has turned into January of next year.  And...  And I...  The only reason I'm bringing this up is because I heard some chatter in the hallway.  Shatter.  And people are saying, there's no way it's happening in January of next year. 
[00:44:00]  Oh, really?  Is that the word on the street?  Yes.  Word on the street says...  Jesus Christ.  It's like the guy that says to his wife, I'll never hit you again, and she keeps coming  back.  Right.  Said he wouldn't.  Right.  He's very loving.  It's just...  Sometimes he gets...  I get him mad.  I make him mad.  It's my fault.  Right.  It's our fault.  Ah, shit.  I don't know.  Ah, we're going to go.  I don't know.  I blame Scott Greenstein because I guess he's... 
[00:44:30]  He is the vice president of programming, right?  Does he give a...  Isn't he the president?  I haven't seen...  I don't know.  I haven't seen him in a while.  He acts more like a vice president.  So I'll say he's a vice president.  Has it been a year that we've been off of...  Yeah, it's been over a year, right?  What?  Off of the bladder...  No, no.  That's...  No?  When was it?  January.  Really?  No, that wasn't January, was it?  I have no idea.  It was in the fall.  It was?  It was in the fall.  September, October-ish.  So I still see the statuette. 
[00:45:00]  He hasn't picked it about the award.  He still hasn't picked up his award.  Why won't he pick up his award?  I think because it's a cheap statue that says the world's greatest secretary on it.  Do you think you found that complimentary?  No, I didn't.  You know what?  Tough shit.  Probably not.  Tough shit.  So, yeah, I blame Scott Greenstein, because, I mean, at this point he has to be aware that  we have major studio problems, and I don't know.  I don't see him doing anything about it.  Yeah.  What, Scott, you going to get mad now? 
[00:45:30]  You going to get mad?  It's all the, uh...  Where he looks at me in the hall, he gave me a big beating today.  Yeah, we did, didn't we?  Anyway.  It's all wiring under this console or something.  I saw Mars hard at work right before the show.  He had drills in his hand.  He's trying.  Hammers and screwdrivers.  I've seen him walk into the men's room with a drill in his hand.  That's pesky dividers.  Just an excuse to have a drill, right?  Ah, shit. 
[00:46:00]  Do you think anyone has been in a stall as a hole is being drilled?  Like...  That would really be funny.  Like you're a guy just instantly taking your dump, and all of a sudden somebody's drilling  right next to you, because they've got to get that hole done.  A little hole saw.  Nice thick, thick fucking bit.  Coming through.  When the guy throws a cord under it, he's like, hey, could you plug that in?  I'm thinking of shit. 
[00:46:30]  Mike Francesa also knows...  What do you mean also knows nothing about soccer?  Uh-oh.  You son of a bitch.  Implying that...  I'm learning every day about soccer.  Kick the ball.  Got obsessed fans on Twitter trying to, like, tell me how great soccer is.  To those people, relax.  If you like soccer, congratulations.  Great.  Good for you.  Why the need to make sure everyone else likes soccer?  But they're obsessively tweeting about it.  I'm trying to watch the World Cup. 
[00:47:00]  I don't know.  There was a game yesterday.  It was 0-0.  They don't even settle a tie.  You mean the game ends 0-0?  I believe so.  Are you kidding?  How do they work that out in a world competition?  Have a dumb shootout or something.  Wow.  Wasn't there a 0-0 game yesterday?  Yeah.  Mexico-Brazil.  0-0.  So what happens?  Yeah.  That girl's, like, topless.  I'm trying to see what that is.  0-0.  That's exciting.  So they don't even settle the games. 
[00:47:30]  You literally watched guys run back and forth on a giant field.  Right.  And that's it.  So stop with the hockey comparisons, people.  Just stop it.  I could see where a 0-0 game would be exciting.  But then you can't leave the stadium going, oh, all right.  That's it.  I guess we didn't even have to play this game today.  At least you could do is jerk me off or something.  Right.  How is a 0-0 game exciting if you're leaving without a win or a loss? 
[00:48:00]  Man.  So I don't know.  What do they do about that?  Does nothing happen?  I guess they both get a point in the bracket or something.  I don't know how that works.  Well, you know more than I did because I didn't even know that.  One, what is a, what's a D?  These are the options, a W, a D, and an L.  So what's a D?  Win, draw.  A draw.  Yes.  They can't even have a T for tie? 
[00:48:30]  That's not, that's not what football says.  I don't know.  They don't like that.  I'm trying to watch because it is the World Cup.  Fuck it.  The Americans did well and they're playing Portugal and they're going to get their ass kicked.  But before they get their ass kicked, everyone is very excited about,  you know, our team.  Yeah.  I shan't fall into this whole thing.  No?  No, I'm not a big, I'm not a big fan of the soccer.  What Travis said yesterday, like, made a lot of sense.  Like, when people make the hockey comparison, it's like, 
[00:49:00]  how many shots on goal were there?  Five.  The entire game.  Like five or seven, even.  Mexico had three yesterday.  Three?  Oh, I see.  And then you watch playoff hockey and it was like, you know, 70 some odd shots on goal.  Between the two teams.  Yeah.  So there was less than.  Stop with that comparison.  So there were less than 10 shots on goal, I would assume, yesterday in that game.  Total.  Yesterday there were 11.  11.  11 total shots on goal.  11 shots on goal.  Yeah.  Look, if you like soccer, I'm fine.  I'm not trying to tell you not to like soccer. 
[00:49:30]  Yeah.  But these people that are getting mad because we're not into this soccer thing.  Right, right.  I'm trying, but they love it.  I find it boring.  Yeah.  I've tried to watch it.  I just find it boring.  Yeah.  It's just not my sport.  Dull.  It's dull.  But the ratings are very good for the World Cup.  Yeah.  I'll acknowledge that.  Yeah.  People are absolutely watching all over the place.  They're loving it.  What did Mike Francesa have to say about soccer?  Ah, I hear a...  This is going viral today, I hear. 
[00:50:00]  He's really dumb, right?  Did he actually say...  I didn't see this clip.  But did he actually ask if you could use both feet in soccer?  That was one of the questions he asked.  If you could use both feet?  Really?  Yes.  For what?  He said, are there any players who use both feet?  So he doesn't know if you could...  No, see...  I mean, he said, are there righties...  What are they, righties, lefties?  Are there any players that use both feet?  His whole...  His whole radio career, he's talked about sports.  And he doesn't know that they could use both feet? 
[00:50:30]  I mean, it's not like this is the first World Cup.  Is he asking about whether they're kind of like being ambidextrous?  Like, are there players that are equally good kickers with their left or right feet?  He said, can they use both feet?  Oh, my God.  That's pretty good.  He does sports for a living.  Sure, we get shit wrong all the time as far as sports goes on our show.  I don't know about soccer.  We're not labeled the Opie and Anthony sports show.  Right.  That's true.  How do you not know the basics of stuff after all these years of broadcasting?  What do I do?  I see them use their heads.  Can they use their feet? 
[00:51:00]  Both feet?  I don't know about soccer.  Let's hear this.  This is a montage.  He had a coach on the phone.  Okay.  And it's a montage of just questions, no answers.  Okay.  Are the best players in the world, the guys who are international stars in Italy, Argentina,  Brazil, England, Germany, et cetera, are every one of them participating in this event?  Dave.  That was question one.  If I gave you, if I brought you in and I said, okay, I bring you in and I say, Dave, listen, 
[00:51:30]  I want America to win a World Cup in the next three World Cup events.  I'll give you a blank check.  Now, it's not about buying the best players from other teams.  I want to do it legitimately.  What would, first of all, is it humanly possible?  Secondly, what would you do to, and money's not an issue, what would you do to get there  if it is at all possible to do? 
[00:52:00]  How many of these guys who are coaching these teams do you know?  Do you know all these coaches?  How do you know how many minutes they're going to put on at the end?  That drives me crazy.  Shouldn't they put that clock up somewhere and let everybody know?  Do you know on the sidelines what's going on there?  And I sort of got to make a winning kick with a lefty kick.  Are there guys who kick with both legs?  Get out of here.  No.  He's great.  Come on.  He's doing this on purpose.  He's got to be doing this on purpose.  Come on.  He's not doing it on purpose. 
[00:52:30]  How wouldn't, what?  Of course this guy knows all the coaches.  He's into the sport.  He knows all the coaches.  He probably can name just about every player in the World Cup.  He's too dumb to be ironic, Frank.  He's not doing it to be ironic.  He was just stupid.  Is there ever a square ball used or is it always round?  If you had all the money in the world, but you weren't buying players, but you wanted  to make a good team, but is it possible if you wanted to use the money to...  Could they fly like that Harry Potter game where they fly in the air on the brooms? 
[00:53:00]  Hey, how long is this game, huh?  How long?  They should put a clock up there so we know how long the game is.  Of course, you don't have to be an expert, but if you do a sports talk show, you've got  to know the basics.  You should know how long a soccer game is.  Right.  Go ahead.  They're guys who kick with both legs?  If I look at a team like Brazil or Italy, is every guy who's on that World Cup team,  is he making big money somewhere in the world playing soccer? 
[00:53:30]  What do they actually get if they win the World Cup?  Is it just a trophy?  Is there money involved?  Is there anything involved?  What, the best team in the world, pro team, would that be like Manchester United or Barcelona,  someone like that?  Would that be the best teams?  With like a trophy, like a plaque, a certificate, they wear sneakers, and you can't really sneak  in a game like this because it's televised.  What?  Comment.  Comment. 
[00:54:00]  Mike Francesca, comment.  Amazing.  Absolutely amazing.  Why do you think he takes that call?  Why does he do that call?  Because people tell him, like, you should be talking about soccer.  Oh, sure.  So, yeah.  I don't know.  It's a guy that knows soccer.  He's a coach.  Right.  Who was he?  A college coach, I think.  A college coach.  So he would know a lot.  But those questions are just goofy.  Those are like...  He's a wacky guy.  He has really long questions.  I think that's because he has to do five hours by himself.  Maybe.  And I think he extends those questions. 
[00:54:30]  Let's just say I have this.  But if I have...  Like, he wants to make each question...  Yeah, yeah.  ...kill time.  Right.  He could get the question out very quickly.  Yeah.  But he chooses not to.  Hey, if you had unlimited funds, could you put the perfect team together?  Oh.  That was three...  Right.  ...three seconds.  Of course.  Sorry, I was distracted by the news segment where all the anchors and people get involved.  The hosts of the...  Oh, what are they doing?  They're doing some exercises.  They're doing some exercises.  You can put your leg off the floor and push it over.  Look at that.  Okay.  The next thing you're going to do then, especially if you don't have a lot of time, we're just 
[00:55:00]  going to go continue in this motion into your abs.  You're just going to take your knees in.  Doing some mountain climbers.  I don't like those.  I don't like the mountain climbers.  I hate them.  Look, they're all doing it.  Oh, the one guy took his suit jacket off so he could exercise.  In his dress shoes.  The blonde one is a goofball.  She's pretty goofy.  No, the guy.  Oh, the guy.  The other one we had on our show, he was all right.  Brian Kilmeade.  Brian Kilmeade, yeah.  He was all right.  But the other one is a goofball.  Oh. 
[00:55:30]  Exactly.  So, Lee, I have created thousands of movies that don't have names.  I'm going to move in this way and then...  Oh, she's lovely.  Yeah.  She's looking out like that.  Pretty lovely.  They all look so stupid.  Whenever the news people are doing anything, look, we got to do it.  Hey, the hula hoop champion is here today.  Let's...  Whoa, whoa, I'm hula hooping.  It just looks so stupid.  You can't fill up that time with something else?  Something, anything.  There's a lot going on.  Oh, boy.  The coach was from St. John's. 
[00:56:00]  Thank you, Jerry, on Long Island.  So, on the Mike Francesa clip.  Who knew?  Apparently not Mike Francesa.  So, of course, a college soccer coach would know the ins and outs of the World Cup.  So, I get why you would do that, but then to ask goofy questions.  Is the World Cup a real cup?  Can you drink out of it?  How does that work?  How does he not know you can use both feet?  Well, he, I think he was assuming that you train like a lefty and a righty batter or something.  And like, you know, can a guy that has trained his whole life to kick with his right foot, 
[00:56:30]  can he kick with his left foot?  But he's well into his 50s.  He's not five years old.  A five-year-old would ask that, you know, when he starts playing soccer.  Am I allowed to use both feet?  Where do boogers come from?  Right.  Yes, is there a monster under my bed?  Right.  Someone well into their 50s should know by now you can use both feet in soccer.  Can I stay up past 7.30 tonight?  Please, please, mommy, daddy. 
[00:57:00]  Please.  I don't know.  Yeah.  He's entertaining as fuck, though.  I gotta tell you.  Yeah.  Yeah, his clips do very well online.  Yeah, his clips.  You try to watch or listen to an entire show, it's fucking, those entertaining moments are  few and far between.  I really did like Mike and the Mad Dog.  Yeah.  You know, when I was out there on Long Island doing night radio, I would listen to them a  little bit in the afternoon.  They were good together.  They were really good together. 
[00:57:30]  Yeah, the crotchety old guy and the fucking energetic younger guy.  Right.  Sure.  I was impressed he did well on his own, though.  Like, I figured he was a dead man, but he actually has done fine on his own, so I kind  of respect that.  Yeah.  He's a droning man, though.  Oh, boy.  This guy's flying.  Well, you know what?  Why don't we try to help a listener today?  Why not?  Let's say hi to Nick in Wisconsin.  Nick?  Hey, guys.  How you doing today?  All right.  Hey, I'm flying down to Florida tomorrow, and I have to fly United. 
[00:58:00]  Do you guys have any advice?  Oh, by the way, I did a complaint.  What do you mean?  You filed a complaint?  I filed a complaint with United after my Cancun debacle.  Oh.  Debacle.  And you know what?  They don't even get back to you.  They don't give a fuck.  No.  They're terrible.  United sucks.  So what I would suggest, I would suggest anything you need, like today, I would bring  on with the carry-on. 
[00:58:30]  Sorry.  I'm a little fucking pissed off.  I'm remembering the bullshit they put me through in my family.  Are they known for losing a lot of their fucking luggage?  They seem to be losing a lot of luggage lately, is my point.  So, you know, I would bring a lot of stuff in the carry-on for the day, because you might  just have to wait a day for your luggage.  A lot of people have been doing that of late, because they don't want to pay, like, extra  for bags, and it's really tying up the old overheads.  Right.  Well, yesterday, Rory McIlroy, like I said yesterday on this show, my family vacationed 
[00:59:00]  to Mexico.  They lost one of my bags, and it was diapers and shit.  I could deal in the end.  What are you going to do?  It sucks.  Shit your pants.  It sucks.  You know, you should be able to get your luggage when you land, but for some reason,  United told me it was good news that my bag was, I think it was in Houston.  Good news.  Luggage is in Houston.  And you'll get it tomorrow.  That's great.  Thank you.  Thank you for that.  I'm so glad I flew with you guys.  Yeah.  But with Rory McIlroy.  McIlroy.  They fucking lost his clubs. 
[00:59:30]  He needed this.  He's one of the top golfers in the world, and I guess he's in Ireland, or Dublin, Ireland.  He was in Ireland, playing some golf.  He's got some kind of tournament this weekend, and he actually had a tweet United and said,  hey, man, you know where my golf clubs are?  I kind of need them this weekend.  Whatever happened with that, Travis?  Do you know?  No, I don't know.  I bet he got his clubs back.  Right.  Yeah, but still.  Yeah.  That should never happen.  It just should never happen. 
[01:00:00]  If you buy a ticket to fly somewhere, your luggage should go on the plane.  Yeah.  Yeah, it's true.  Period.  Oh, they have it all figured out.  I don't try to reason it.  So, good luck with you, United.  Let me know how it works.  You might be all right.  Who knows?  Yeah, that's what our planners do carry on, so thanks, guys.  All right.  And don't look at the waitresses in the sky the wrong way.  Sky waitress.  Because they'll give you an attitude.  How dare you ask for something. 
[01:00:30]  They are full of the tood.  Oh, boy, are they.  I would say 90% of them.  Yeah.  That's my number.  90% of the waitresses in the sky are twats.  Thank you, Nick.  Have a good day.  Yep.  United replied to Rory.  What did they say?  They said this was yesterday.  They said, we have good news.  Your clubs will be in tomorrow, and we'll deliver them to the tournament for you.  Deliver them to the tournament.  Imagine sitting there at the tournament going, I need my clubs.  Where are they? 
[01:01:00]  Goof ball in a van pulling up with your golf clubs.  Oh, jeez.  My diaper's not as important as Rory McIlroy's clubs.  Oh, is that what's happening?  That United lost his clubs?  Yes.  Throwing them out at a truck trying to get to Michigan to cash in bottles.  Seinfeld.  Seinfeld.  Yeah.  That's how you look at Travis.  Yeah, of course.  You can't look at Travis when you're trying to do that.  No, no.  I wasn't even trying to.  As soon as you look at Travis.  Wait, did Rory really lose his clubs, or is that a Seinfeld thing?  No, he lost Seinfeld.  Oh, okay.  Yeah, yeah.  I don't know.  It was a big story yesterday, because Rory went to Twitter like, excuse me, I need my 
[01:01:30]  clubs.  Where are they?  He was trying to be nice about it.  Was that his only recourse?  Or did he, you think he called?  Like, called United and said, hi, I'm a professional golfer.  Probably.  I need my clubs.  Or did he just decide, ah, I'm just going to go to Twitter?  I'm sure he called, but I'm sure also he wanted to make it hurt a little bit and make  sure the world knows that United lost his golf clubs.  That is pretty good that now you can do that.  I think that's the best way to get a response.  It probably is, because other people are going to retweet it, your fans, especially 
[01:02:00]  if you have a shitload.  It's going to make the news.  It'll make the news, right.  Right.  So they got to fess up, lickety split.  Right.  Anyway.  I hate all these big airline mergers.  Yeah.  So expensive, airfare.  Like, I got to go out to San Francisco in August, and it's like, there's no, like,  even remotely reasonable way to, it's fucking really expensive.  Expensive now?  Really expensive.  To fly?  Yeah, I mean, it always is pricey, but it's like really brutal.  There's only a few airlines left.  Is it worse than the summer? 
[01:02:30]  Yeah, because everyone is doing their trip, so they take advantage of that.  That's just a scumbag move by these companies.  I don't know anything about, like, when is the best thing to fly the cheapest, during  the year, during the week.  None of that shit.  Thanksgiving is expensive.  You know that.  And Christmas or whatever.  Yeah.  Basically, if the kids are off, the airlines raise the prices, period.  That's how it works.  Supply and demand.  So, fucking summertime, everyone, you know, their kids are out of school, so you can travel.  You can't really travel if you've got kids in school.  Hmm.  So. 
[01:03:00]  So they rape you.  They rape you.  Companies do this shit all the time.  Uh-huh.  It's amazing.  You know, when there's big events here in New York City, what happens to the hotels?  The prices go through the roof.  Hotel prices are the dumbest thing I've ever heard.  Like, from one day to the next, the price difference could be a hundred dollars.  A hundred.  Oh, I know.  Hundreds.  Hundreds, you should say.  It's just ridiculous.  Right.  They all suck.  They make believe they care about you, the customer. 
[01:03:30]  Just trying to shake down the common man.  Right.  It's what it is.  But the competition is less and less.  It's like they're just being gobbled up.  There's going to be like three or four of them left.  Yep.  Who's there?  Delta.  There's United, which used to be Continental.  Now, what did the Americans just buy up?  Northwestern or?  You got the JetBlue, too, obviously.  Yeah.  And then, I don't know.  Is Southwest still happening?  I have no idea.  They are.  I don't fly enough.  I only fly like once a year now.  Twice a year, maybe.  But like the major airlines that fly, you know, internationally and stuff. 
[01:04:00]  How many are left?  JetBlue has gotten expensive, too.  Really?  Yeah.  It used to be really cheap, but now I think they always intended on becoming a major airline.  They just started their first class.  They did, yeah.  Oh, they finally got first class.  Yeah, they have first class to L.A. and then in October, San Francisco.  I got to tell you, I've always had a really good experience with JetBlue.  JetBlue's great.  And you like them, huh?  I love them.  Yeah.  They're great.  They don't take themselves too seriously.  Yeah.  They have the wacky guy that makes the announcements.  The pilot comes in sometimes and goes, wah, wah, wah, wah. 
[01:04:30]  Hi, everybody.  I don't want my pilot moonwalking up the aisle.  No.  They, no, they, uh, I don't know.  They, they just kind of talk to you like a human being.  Yeah.  And they, they keep it light.  Yeah.  They don't try to like hit you with too many goofy jokes and stuff.  I don't know.  Free chat bag.  Virgin American.  I like that airline.  They're good.  They don't fly to many places, though.  Where you go?  Vegas, maybe?  L.A.  Do they even go to Vegas?  I know from here they go to L.A.  They go to San Francisco.  I took them to Vegas, yeah. 
[01:05:00]  Oh, they do.  Okay.  Yeah.  Weird purple lighting.  I kind of like that when you walk in.  It's like the future.  Weird.  Yeah, that purplish lighting.  It's like being on Soul Plane.  Yeah.  I think that's, uh, just to kind of get you calm for your flight.  That's nice.  Nice.  Why is McElroy flying on United?  He should be flying a private jet.  Over to Europe?  I'm sure he flies private here and there, but you can't fly private.  Every time you need to be somewhere. 
[01:05:30]  Mm-hmm.  I don't think.  I don't think he has that.  I mean, he has money, but.  Those private flights are what?  A lot of money.  50 G's easy?  Especially overseas like that?  To Europe, it's probably more easy.  Oh, to Europe, it's way more than 50.  Fuck, yeah.  But I'm just saying, let's say you're New York to Florida, I think that'll cost you 40 or 50 G's.  Some guys won't go.  I was talking to somebody recently.  They won't take private overseas because it's too cramped, and you start to get, like, a little stir crazy.  Like, a major airline's first class is just bigger, I guess. 
[01:06:00]  Plus, he's got Ted Danson's plane.  All right.  Wait.  Hold on.  Cheers.  Plus, those are the planes that go down more than the commercial ones.  You don't hear about it all the time.  You're just kind of like, oh.  So, yeah, it's like 10 private jets crashed this year.  I didn't hear that.  Right.  How did they tell anybody this?  We had a plane crash out on Long Island yesterday.  Yeah, Pat Chog. 
[01:06:30]  What was it?  A little two-seater?  One of those little Piper or Cessnas, and then it gets crashed into a house.  Oh, wow.  So the guy died?  He's done, yeah.  Done for.  I think everyone else is all right.  Where was he going?  Republic or something?  Small plane crashes into a Long Island yard, one dead, and that would be the pilot.  They were hinting that the mom, like, ran out of the house without the kid or something.  Uh-oh.  Is it in that story?  Because I guess the kid was still in the crib or whatever with shards and glass all over the place. 
[01:07:00]  So they're like, wow, you ran out of the house without your kid?  She ran out, pushed grandma out of the way, and fucking, that was it.  Got to respect that.  The story I read, they said that the mom might have ran without the kid.  Hey, that's a survival instinct right there.  Fuck it.  Right.  Yeah.  McElroy. 
[01:07:30]  Good old McElroy.  When does that start?  Is he playing?  I don't know what tournament it is.  It must be one of the Europeans.  It's not one of the big ones?  I think, right?  Goff without the L.  It's probably one of the European tournaments.  I don't know.  I have no idea.  HR.  I'm just waiting for Tiger Woods to come back.  It's the Irish Open.  The Irish Open.  All right, that's a big deal.  Where's Tiger Woods?  Did you get surgery?  Yeah, back surgery.  Oh, boy.  And they're saying he's swinging more and more and harder and harder. 
[01:08:00]  Getting back?  He's pretty much out for the rest of this year.  He'll probably squeeze a couple, maybe, tournaments in.  But it's probably very dangerous for him to not be playing golf.  Let him wander off.  Oh, right.  Get his mind on other things like those fucking waitresses over there.  He's not healed.  No, no, no.  I don't think he's healed.  No, no, no.  Sex addiction.  That's got to be a motherfucker to get over.  Jesus.  Yeah, because you still want to have sex.  I'll tell you, though.  Stop.  As a golf fan, it's tough to watch these tournaments without Tiger Woods. 
[01:08:30]  Without the Tiger?  And, you know, a lot of the networks get a lot of shit because they show Tiger so much,  even if he's kind of out of the tournament.  Uh-huh.  But I don't know.  It feels weird without him.  Yeah, he's one of those guys.  They just had the U.S. Open over the weekend.  No one really was talking about it.  Yeah, yeah.  There was no real competition there.  He's the guy that put a face on golf to more people than just golf fans, you know, over 
[01:09:00]  the years.  How weird is that old Mike Douglas footage when he's like a kid?  Oh, man, that's so weird.  What is it, like four?  Yeah.  Four or five, right?  Yeah, that's so fucking weird.  With Bob Hope.  Is that what I was talking about?  I think Bob Hope was on that same show.  How weird is that?  Yeah, look at this little colored kid.  I gotta tell you, he sure knows how to swing a club.  Now if only you could join a club.  He would do all that. 
[01:09:30]  Of course.  That's funny.  Ah, shit.  Is that the, that's the clip?  Wow, man.  Father Earlwood.  Earlwood.  Hey, Earlwood's done.  That is.  Look how old he is.  He's adorable.  Look at him.  Khaki shorts.  Oh, yeah.  Playing wacky music.  Is that Jimmy Stewart, too?  Oh, man.  Could be, yeah.  Could be.  It's hard to see.  It's a bad copy.  Right down the middle. 
[01:10:00]  That's another little kid hitting it.  Earl.  V.J.  V.J.  V.J.  Sing.  How old are you, Tiger?  Daddy.  Two.  Two?  Oh, he's two.  He's two?  Two years old.  Oh, that was Tiger that hit it.  Oh, it could look like, okay.  No, that was Tiger Woods.  So he was two.  He was shorter then.  And he hit it right down the middle.  That's great.  He probably only went about 50, 60 yards.  Yeah, 50 or 60 yards.  That's incredible he was on, too.  Friar Tarkinson. 
[01:10:30]  He wins tournaments on a regular basis and has shot close to par on 18-hole courses.  Incredibly, Tiger here is only five years old.  Wow.  On the tee, we have the 9 o'clock starting group, the youngest contestant ever.  He's five years old.  Eldrick Tiger Woods.  Damn.  Holy shit.  I think I want him out to anything.  On a golf course, Tiger has the kind of poise and confidence that would be the envy of  most golfers ten times his age. 
[01:11:00]  Get the hell out of here.  I've never seen that.  Five years old.  His knowledge of the game is truly amazing.  That's an amazing story.  Tiger has an overall concept of strategy right now.  I pointed him down the left side of the fairway as an overall concept.  Then he appeared that concept repeatedly right down the fairway.  And as we approached the hole, which he had never played before, we made slight adjustments. 
[01:11:30]  That's amazing.  And then he followed the concept.  The way his little feet ease up to the ball.  Everything is his body language when he's playing isn't like a kid.  Not at all.  He knows how to play the game at that age.  He's like a little man dressing a little golfer with his little sweater.  Yeah, yeah.  He's like a midget.  He hits it where he wants to hit it.  Not only where, but how he wants to hit it.  Par, par, par.  Okay, you gonna make a par on the last hole? 
[01:12:00]  Uh-huh.  Okay.  All right, let's go do it.  He looks very agey when he was a kid, right?  Yeah.  And what are the odds that like you get a clip like this when he's a kid and he actually  winds up being huge in it?  Wow.  Well, when he was about six months old, I had this putter cut down and I gave it to  Six months?  And he had dragged this thing around all over the house and I worked out in the garage.  How's that, Tiger? 
[01:12:30]  Jesus.  Tiger must be so sick of golf balls, not golf.  When he was 11 months old, I took a break and he walked right over, picked up his little  putter, set up just like I did, looked at the net as his target, took the club back,  and hit the ball right in the center of the net.  At 11 months old.  At age two, I took him out on a course and he played a regulation course, nine holes, which 
[01:13:00]  is par 36, and he shot a 48.  But he entered his first tournament.  That's 12-hour par.  Ah, that stinks.  At two.  And he was competing in the...  He was better at two than I would be at 45.  Yes.  Wow.  And at three, he won it.  That's unbelievable.  If you think you ever have a shot at beating Tiger Woods at golf, watch this.  Yeah.  We can't dictate to him what he can be and what he cannot be. 
[01:13:30]  So as a consequence, what we do is we participate with him in golf.  And if it was bowling, we would participate with him in bowling.  And each and every one of us has our own life.  Oh, here's the mom.  And he has a choice.  What happened?  To live his life the way he wants to live his life.  Her arms are folded.  She hates him.  She hates golf.  That body language said, I hate golf and I hate you.  Well, you know, she's heard about golf a lot, and now she knows, oh, God, the kid likes it, too.  Right. 
[01:14:00]  There's going to be a lot of golf chatter at this house.  All right.  How much longer is this?  I've never seen this whole clip.  I never, yeah.  He's sitting on Fran Tarkenton's lap in the first part of it.  Right.  And he's an adult.  Yeah, it was really bizarre.  Last week.  Yeah, and Fran was sitting in a wheelchair.  Is Fran still alive?  I'm sure.  Yeah, I think he is.  Remember we saw Fran Tarkenton?  At a steak joint.  Yeah.  Atlanta.  With two broads.  Yeah.  Two babes.  Yeah, I remember that.  That's incredible. 
[01:14:30]  Do you remember that?  Who else was his co-host on this?  Was it Sarah Purcell?  Sarah Purcell.  Very good.  Kathy Lee Crosby.  Was Crosby part of that?  What was Skip Stevenson on?  He was on the other show.  Oh, he was on.  Real People.  Welcome to Real People.  Oh, wow.  Very good.  Keep it going for extended periods of time.  All right.  That was kind of, he was like the funny guy on Real People.  That was your, like, reality show of the 70s.  Right.  Yeah, yeah.  Sam, do you remember these shows?  Oh, Sam.  I didn't remember that.  I didn't realize that Tiger was that good at that age. 
[01:15:00]  I didn't realize.  Where he was getting, you know, TV attention and shit.  Well, yeah.  He had a 12-hour par at age two.  So he should have won a hell of a lot more tournaments than he has.  Yeah, what the fuck?  Yeah.  He's slowing way down, too, now.  He was on pace to beat Jack Nicklaus as far as, you know, the majors go.  Can he still beat him?  Yeah, but now he's, like, kind of tied with him, almost.  Yeah.  You know, the age Jack was and how many majors he won, now Tiger's pretty much tied as far 
[01:15:30]  as his age goes.  You mean Jack Nicklaus?  Oh, wait.  Oh, did I say Jack Nicklaus?  No, no, no.  I always get that wrong, too.  You didn't.  Jack Nicklaus.  Okay.  I was just being a tool.  But every time I got to think, wait, Jack.  Yeah, yeah.  Say it right.  Say it right.  Not Nicholson.  It's Jack Nicklaus.  Dude, that whole texting thing was a part of his, I believe that was, like, some kind of a weird  distraction relief.  Right.  Like, you know, it just kind of kept his head clear.  And then when he had to stop it, he was probably like, oh, what the fuck?  He had all the extra energy.  Yeah.  He's won since then, obviously, but not to the level. 
[01:16:00]  It changed him on some.  Yeah, maybe.  Not to the level he was winning before that.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  And that confidence he had, he probably feels, like, all exposed and, like, everybody knows  how he talks.  Imagine if everybody knew how you talk dirty.  It is odd because, like, you see him now and you do think, you know, wow, great golfer and  everything, but it's always, like, uh, we know what he did.  And he's got to know that everybody thinks that.  Yeah.  Embarrassing.  Well, what are those guys up to?  Yeah.  What are the rest of the...  It's been six years since he won a major.  Yeah, it's been a long time. 
[01:16:30]  Wow.  So now, like, he was way ahead of Jack's pace, and now it's, like...  He's only four behind.  Right.  But he's been four behind for, yeah, like, six years.  He should have passed him by now.  You think he's panicking like they do when they're going for a home run record?  He has to be, because he's, like, I think he's, like, 38, I want to say.  He's upper 30s now.  38, you're right.  38, yeah.  He'll be 39 in December.  I actually love Tiger Woods.  I love watching him.  Jesus, Travis, you know everything about him.  I know, exactly.  Little Travis Woods.  Moe.  Yeah, what, are you running around pretending you're Tiger, too? 
[01:17:00]  He handed, Travis handed Riley a golf club when she was in it, and she smashed him in the  knees with it.  Speaking of golf.  A golf.  I'm a sucker for a celebrity that follows me, I'll tell you right the fuck now.  I've been following you since the beginning.  And I do have an update on the Courtney Love DMs as well.  Really?  But I'm a sucker when a celebrity follows me, and I want to say hi to Brian Harmon, who plays  on the PGA Tour. 
[01:17:30]  Well.  He's one of the lower level guys.  Yeah.  But he has a lot of potential.  He is Harmon Brian on Twitter.  And why?  We were talking about golf yesterday, and he said he wanted to know that he's a fan.  Here it is.  Opie Radio.  Thanks for watching.  You all have plenty of fans on tour.  Love the show.  Well.  I don't know if we have a lot of fans on the PGA Tour.  Maybe he talks about the show, and people know what he's talking about. 
[01:18:00]  And then I looked at his Twitter, man.  This guy, he's all in with hunting and fishing, guns.  Really?  Oh, he's your man.  Oh, then obviously he's a fan.  He is your man.  Yeah.  He loves his guns.  Loves a good gun.  Look at the camo.  Oh, yeah.  Look at the camo.  Nice.  Would you be scared if you saw that in the woods?  Yeah.  That's good.  Good man.  Oh, yeah.  And look.  All his.  Oh, yeah.  He's got some ducks. 
[01:18:30]  A lot of ducks.  He loves his duck hunting.  He's got himself some ducks.  He's just holding a snake like it's no big deal.  This guy doesn't have time for golf, it looks like.  Brian, call our show.  We'd love to say hi.  How does he do in the tour?  I kind of looked him up.  He, you know.  He's in it.  He's in it.  He's not making the cut a lot in the big tournaments.  Yeah.  You know, but then he does all right in other ones.  So he's a young guy.  I think he's only like 24 or so.  Mm-hmm.  25.  And then Courtney Love, because we pushed her future son-in-law's band, the Eeries, with 
[01:19:00]  that cool kid song.  I remember.  She finally got back to me.  She sent it out to a bunch of people.  She finally got back to me and said, fucking love you.  So she was very happy.  Fucking love you, dot, dot, dot, your name here.  Oh, yeah.  I know.  I know.  She didn't reverse a couple of those words.  Yeah.  No, I know she probably sent that to a lot of people. 
[01:19:30]  I will acknowledge that.  Well, but we got some heat for the Eeries.  I was thinking of that call yesterday that called up and said that the guy from Boardwalk  Empire, Agent Van Alden, you know?  Right.  Michael Shannon.  Yeah, yeah.  Some guy yesterday said that he saw him in a bar and mentioned the show, and he said,  yeah, he's a big fan.  It's like, what?  That'd be fantastic.  Most of the time, they don't mean it.  I know.  Most of the time.  No.  We have guys come in here, and they'll tell us, big fan of the show, I gotta tell you. 
[01:20:00]  And then you talk to them for 10 minutes, and you have a good time with them, but you  realize during that time, they don't know the first thing about this radio show.  No.  It's all bullshit.  All right.  Why don't we take a break?  Um, we gotta talk about the situation.  We were talking about him yesterday, and then I get home, and I turn on the news, and there  he is, in a little bit of a jam.  Very suspicious.  Very suspicious.  Come on. 
[01:20:30]  We'll talk about the situation next.  I'm very suspicious.  And today's podcast day, Sam.  What do we got for the podcast this week?  T.I.  That was a good one.  The T.I. interview.  Very cool.  Good.  That was fun.  That was hilarious.  Me and him got along very well.  You did get along with T.I.  He said I was a decent human being or something.  There was the greatest mischaracterization I've ever heard.  It was the greatest view that I had, watching Jim Norton's eyes pop out of his head as he  looked at T.I. like, are you insane? 
[01:21:00]  I told you, rappers and Anthony, there's no reason you guys shouldn't get along great.  You all like the same stuff.  Very similar lifestyle.  Yes, yes.  I just pull my pants up.

That is  Button  Non Grata  You were on this earlier  Yeah  Now you're over here  Now not so much  Alright  No big deal  It's just microphones  For a radio show  How important is the microphone?  Apparently very  How about we ask 
[01:35:00]  Scott Greenstein?  Ask him  For me, please  Ask him how important  Is the microphones  For a radio show  Because I'm not sure  He knows  72 for Paul McCartney  Oh, is that what  We're looking at?  I didn't know  What the anniversary was  Way past  When I'm 64  I remember when  They were talking  About that  Like, Paul McCartney's 64  And they kept playing  He's eight years  Past that now  Wow  And still doing it  Rocking  We saw him at 70 
[01:35:30]  I guess at this point  Right?  At the Apollo  He was 70 probably  71  Moving around like  Like  Yeah, he's fucking great  Like a man  Half his age  Yuck  And he  His voice is great  His voice hasn't lost  No  He's  That sounds great  Lost anything  Alright, what else  Is going on?  Oh yeah, sure  The situation  So  We had a ball  With the situation  Yesterday  Oh yeah 
[01:36:00]  We were talking  About his new show  The Sorrentinos  Yeah, very  You got  Who you got  In the Sorrentinos?  You got  The situation  I just called the man  You got the man  The man, his other brother  And then you got  The older brother  Who's really fucking  Pissed off that he's not famous  Because his whole life  He wanted to be famous  And then when it happened  For the situation  He was really mad  Right  And you got the sister  And that's it  Then you got the sister  Who takes care of all of them  Right  And then you got the mom  Who's  Back out on the dating scene 
[01:36:30]  And looking out  Right  Because the boy's  Going to give her  A little ribbing about that  And the sister  Will lock mom  Out of her own house  If she stays out too late  Right  How about the sister  Gets her own fucking place to live  How about  You can't lock me  Out of my own house  I think that's more pathetic  Than mommy going out  For a few drinks  After she raised you  You ungrateful fucks  Yeah  Yeah  So it looks like  The situation  Was at his tanning salon  That he owns  With his family 
[01:37:00]  That's part of the reality show  Is you're like  Look we're family  And we run a tanning salon  Right  And uh  What a coincidence  Because we did about  A half hour on this yesterday  I know  Right  Had a lot of fun  With the man  And his car  The man  That's right  The man one through eight  Nine  Nine  Sorry  And you know  He might have the license plate  For ten  He probably does  But he probably doesn't have  The funds yet  For car number ten  Yeah  Yeah Jimmy missed this  Uh huh  The situation has a brother 
[01:37:30]  Who calls himself  The man  The man  Like his brother  Is the situation  So he needed a name  He has a tattoo  That says the man  And he has  License plates  He has nine cars  The man  One through nine  Oh no  And their sister  The speculation  Terrible  How devoid are they  Of identities  That they just can't  Have their names  Be their identity  They can't  I don't know  What's going on  In that family  But  So they were  At the tanning salon 
[01:38:00]  Yesterday  And um  The situation  Got in a huge fight  With his older brother  Who's jealous  Of the situation  Yeah  It wasn't the man  He didn't fight the man  No  Who did he fight  Uh his older brother  Who I think's name  Is Mark  Frank  Frank  Frank and Mark  No  Frank  Why would that be his name  Why doesn't he have a nickname  Why doesn't the older brother  Have a nickname  Or does he  The older brother  Oh  I don't know what mic you're on  I think  Let's try this one  Does that work  That works  He was just jealous  Yeah yeah

[01:39:30]  Going through a cycle  Right now  A cycle  Because I don't think  It's just really hard  To get that big  Is that the situation  That's the situation  Oh I think that was his brother  Oh he's fucking way bigger  Than he used to be  The brother of the man  Or just jealous  Just jealous  Formerly known as  The hullabaloo  Wait can you show  The hullabaloo  You gotta show Jimmy  The trailer  I think we gotta back up  A little bit  Because Jimmy wasn't here  So the Sorrentino's  Is the new reality show  The review in the paper  Was wonderful reading  Classic  Wonderful reading  They probably raved about it 
[01:40:00]  Right  Oh wow  No no  They were talking about  Mom's sauce  And all sorts of shit  It is to Italians  What blackface would be  To African Americans  Right  And like what  Amos and Andy  Right  Would be  It's a parody  Of Italian people  So you think this whole thing  Might be staged  For the reality show  Well we're a bit suspicious  Okay  You know the brothers  Go at it  They know  They're gonna get  Some headlines  For their new reality show  And who knows  Maybe they were still taping 
[01:40:30]  So it will  It will be part of the show  Maybe  You need a good fight  If you're doing a reality show  You certainly do  Yeah  Snooki getting punched in the face  Made that show famous  Oh was that great  When she got fucking belted  Yeah  Wow  Alright here's  Once again  The sizzle reel  For the Sorrentinos  Okay  There's a lot of douche chills  In here  Oh yeah  Reality's biggest star  Is Mike the situation  Canceled  He's coming home  There's no place  To call home

[01:41:30]  Clothes  Clubs  Painting salons  But we're a family friend  Right when I was born  I wanted to be a star  So when this happened to Michael  F***  Why did this happen to me?  I'm the jealous  You know the best characteristic  I am the man  My tattoo's actually  A portrait of myself  I have a certain amount of cards  It says the man one  The man two  All the way to the man nine  Who does that?  I'm the chief executive officer  Without your heart  You can't survive  Without Melissa  You can't survive  I'm the queen of everything  I pay for their cars 
[01:42:00]  Buy their clothes  Run their personal lives  I don't even like  Any of the family members  Speaking to me  I want them to speak to Melissa  And Melissa can relay it to me  I just can't help  But take care of them  Even my mother  You give everybody  Your phone number  And you really need to  Scan these guys  A little more thoroughly  My kids are grown  I'm single  I'm going back  To what I missed  Years ago  My curfew tonight  Is eleven peaches  If you don't come home  By a certain time  I'm locking down  Scratch is really  Nugged to the music  I love that  Myself and Mark 
[01:42:30]  Have always been  In competition  I can't even eat  A turkey sandwich  Without Mark  Telling me how to eat it  When I should eat it  That's crazy  Me staying sober  It's a daily struggle  I've been the wild one  The whole life  It's sort of what has made me  But at the same time  Also what has destroyed me  We love each other  No matter what  It's so multifaceted  The Storrentinos  When does it start?  My success is  July 15th 
[01:43:00]  God he fucking built  July 15th you said?  Yes  Also  We didn't tell Jimmy  What channel they're on  Did we?  TV Guide Family  Or something like that  They're on the TV Guide Channel  That's where you want to be  After that TV  The TV Guide Channel  But I guess  I guess they got a little  Fucking ink though  With this fight  Oh boy do they  You know what's so bad about that  It's the way they're all  Defining their characters  Right  And I 
[01:43:30]  That's what  You know  Hey I'm the guy  You're not supposed to say  The stuff that defines you  Right  It's supposed to unfold  Or be through your actions  You're not supposed to sit there  And go  I was always jealous  It should happen  Through your actions  Like the guy yelling  Like you were never  Supposed to be anything  Right  Hey this guy's jealous  You don't just go  I'm the jealous guy  I'm the man  Yeah you don't have to do that  And he probably came up  With his own nickname  You know  Of course he did  The man  I like the hullabaloo  Yeah the hullabaloo  And like you said yesterday 
[01:44:00]  If you see the man  On a license plate  You're laughing  And mocking that person  You're just going  I gotta pull up next to this vehicle  And see the asshole  That's driving this guy  Right  Yeah  The man one  The man two  You think he has self-awareness  That it's a douchey nickname  And that people are mocking it  I don't know  You don't know huh  I have no idea  But he did not  What goes on in that  He didn't fight the man yesterday  He fought his older brother  The jealous one  Who wanted to be famous  His whole life  The jealous 
[01:44:30]  Busted Tuesday  At his family owned tanning salon  After a nasty dust up  With his brother  Sorrentino 31  Was brawling with his brother Frank  That's the one right  The older one  Yeah the one who said  I'm jealous  And I don't  I resent him  He used all the keywords  Right  When cops got a 911 call  About a fist fight  Inside the Middletown  New Jersey salon  They responded  And they only took  The situation into custody  Huh  So  Like who called the cops  Cops charged him  With simple assault 
[01:45:00]  Who called the cops  And his bail was $500  Oh Christ  That's just publicity  Of course  Oh boy  It's not the first time  Cops have been called  To intervene  At the family business  Last week cops responded  After four employees  From the Boca Tanning Club  Filed a police report  Claiming their paychecks  Had bounced  Ha ha ha  Come on  Police said each employee  Was owed between  $100 and $200  They're bouncing  Checks for only  $100 to $200  Nobody's calling the police  That one didn't get 
[01:45:30]  Picked up by TMZ  So then they had to  Have a fight  Right  Yeah they tell  Come on  Call the cops  Tell them  Your $100 check bounced  Stop it  No one does that  It was an innocent mix up  That happened after  The shop switched  Payroll companies  As far as the  Checks bouncing  So  There you have it  Just in time for  Their new show  This happens  Wouldn't you  Wouldn't you go to  The owner first  And say  Why did the checks  Bounce  And you'd say  Oh it's a mix up 
[01:46:00]  With the payroll  Like who calls  The cops  It's so fake  And you'd say  Oh well we had a  Little situation  With payroll  That's his name  What reality show  I want to talk to the man  The man  What reality show  Ruined it all  Like started that  Downhill  Trend of like  We got to do this  In a month  The Osbournes  No they  Because they were  So damn good  Oh yeah  No I'm serious  I think it was  The Osbournes  Were so damn good  At just being themselves  And then every other 
[01:46:30]  Show said  Fuck we have to be  As good as the Osbournes  So they brought in  All these people  To do that  Assist the reality  I think  But was there  Another one before  There must have been  One after the Osbournes  That did it right  What was the first one  That they realized  Oh we don't have to  Spend the amount of money  We spent on the Osbournes  To actually get  Because a good reality show  You really got to  Hang out  You got to hang out  And let it happen naturally  And they just don't want  To do that anymore  We've talked about this  The real world  When it first hit  They were in that house  For well over six months  Now they're not even  In there a month  Yeah 
[01:47:00]  They got it down  To something like  Three, three and a half weeks  And it's because  They scripted  So you don't really have to  Wait for something to happen  They fake it  Make something happen  And then  Like you said  The old days  They would film for months  And months  And then they'd have to  Find the good shit  We talked to a lot  Of those guys  They said they had  So much down time  In between  Action  They were bored  Out of their minds  In those houses  We all think  That we're interesting enough  For a reality show  But you really  I thought of my life  A couple of times  I'm like 
[01:47:30]  You just sit in front  Of the computer  Who the fuck  Would watch this  You know what I mean  Our own lives  Are interesting to us  But to the public  Doesn't give a shit  True  They wouldn't care  I bet  You know what  I think the simple life  That Paris Hilton  And Nicole Richie  Was the first  Wow that's right  Scripted  Short term  But it kind of worked  I like the simple life  Where they do crazy stuff  That they kind of  Got sent on to  But it wasn't  A reality show  No  No that was scripted  When they did the second one  It was horrendous  Right  And that was when  They realized  Oh we could just do this  For a couple weeks  Set up you know 
[01:48:00]  Crazy scenarios  Right  Because the Kardashians  I guess it is jealousy  Because the amount  Of money they make  And the amount  Of numbers they do  For their show  But that show  They just sit around  And do nothing  And people are watching  They really don't do  Anything on that show  Yeah  Yeah  So  I really think it was  The Osbournes  Being so damn good  And everyone panicked  And said oh my god  That's the bar  The bar has been  Risen  But I'm wondering  Who's the first one 
[01:48:30]  To save the money  Maybe he was right  Maybe it was that  Simple life  Yeah I just don't remember  I don't know  Anyone have an answer  For that one out there  I would say simple life  Definitely  What was after  What was another one  That did it right  Like the Osbournes  As far as like  Hey we're just kind of  Filming stuff  And we'll  Was there another one  After that  That shot the same way  I don't know  What was the next one  After the Osbournes  Family Jewels  Was assisted reality  There were some  Real situations  But it was also  Added stuff  You got a little  Gene Simmons romance  Going in  You think so  Yeah  That show sucked 
[01:49:00]  I gave it a shot  It was horrible  It was really bad  I didn't like it at all  Yeah the Gene Simmons show  And the Hulk Hogan show  Were the same show  Right  But those guys  Have enough interesting  Things in their lives  Where at least some of it  Could be  People are saying  Simple Life  A lot of people  Coming up with Simple Life  What about you  Jamie in Baltimore  Hey good morning boys  I just wanted to say  The show that started  All Trainwreck reality  Has to be  Anna Nicole  Oh Anna Nicole  The Anna Nicole show 
[01:49:30]  That one was pretty good  I remember her  That was pretty good though  I remember her  She was a  She was a legitimate mess  That's why that one  Was good  Yeah  Yeah  Yeah  What year was that?  That's gotta be  Ten years ago now  Right  Thank you sir  Old school  Yeah  I remember that  2002  2002  That's 12 years ago  That's 12 years ago  Yeah  When did she die  Like 24, 5?  No  Yeah 
[01:50:00]  It's gonna be like  Fucking 94  When was that  Like 3 years ago?  No  20 years  Right  She died in 07  07  Beginning of 07  7 years ago already  So that  That  That daughter of hers  Is probably  Growing up  Yep  She was a  Fucking disaster  Another one  She'd get all fat  And then she'd get  Skinny and hot again  And then she'd get  Fat again  Yeah like that  And the surreal life 
[01:50:30]  Where the  Look at these train wrecks  Yeah  Yeah  Just  Like those were  The clown reality shows  Parade these disasters  Around  And we can all  Laugh at them  And feel better  About ourselves  Who's in the surreal life?  Everybody  Yeah they did like  5 seasons  Every loser  Oh right right  Yeah yeah yeah  Wasn't mini me  Burned Slayer  Yeah yeah  And I mean  It created a whole  Career for Flavor Flav  Yeah that's true  He got a bunch of  Reality shows after that  And he got 4 reality shows  After that  Yeah  I just have no desire  To watch reality shows anymore 
[01:51:00]  I used to really  Kind of like them  I watched  I watched a lot of them  The best one ever was  The fake one though  The Joe Schmo show?  The Joe Schmo  That was the best  The original Joe Schmo show  It's one of the greatest  Things ever on TV  Yes I said that  It is  100%  The first season  There's nothing better  That's fucking fantastic  Yeah  The guy  You watched every episode?  Yeah  The first season  The reveal  When he finds out  Everyone was in  What the? 
[01:51:30]  He said this  He goes  What is going on here?  Can we play that again?  Matt Kennedy Gould  He is the  Wow you're good  I watched  I have it on DVD  I watched the season  Over and over  They fucked themselves  What you have to do  With the Joe Schmo show  You gotta film like  Five seasons  Without releasing  Any of them  Yeah  Oh yeah  Because then everyone  Was in on it  And they tried to do  A second season  And I think the girl  Was this a real reveal though?  Yeah  This was legit 
[01:52:00]  There's no way  They're gonna fucking fake this  This is where  Kristen Wiig got her start  Was Natasha  In that too  Joe?  No she was in season 2  She was in that one?  Yeah she was season 2  Kristen Wiig with Dr. Pat  That's right  Dr. Pat  With the puppets  Right  I've seen it so many times  Because they  They casted all  The reality stars  That you expect  A guy that might be gay  Yeah  The cool guy  Yeah  The puck  The puck  Who was the hutch  The hutch right 
[01:52:30]  The hutch  He was just puck  But he was called the hutch  Oh god  Does this show still hold up?  I haven't seen it in about  100%  At least 10 years  I watch it  I probably watch the full season  At least once a year  And then the  And then the ceremony  Where you're getting kicked off  You had to smash your plate  In the fireplace  Yeah  And it was  Ralph Garman  Who's on Kevin Smith's  Podcast deal now  Right  Really?  He was in there too  Oh yeah he was  He was the host  Yeah Ralph did a good job 
[01:53:00]  It was all about this one guy?  Yeah it was  Everyone was in on it  He was the only one that wasn't  I think he was from Cleveland  Or something like that  Perfect dark  They picked the perfect  I think he was from Pittsburgh  Pittsburgh that's the city  Yep  Alright yeah  He was from Pittsburgh  I would love to talk to this guy  Matt Kennedy Gold?  Yes  Because he'd never do anything after this right?  No nothing  He didn't want to be a TV star  He just wanted to make some money  To help his family  And he made like  Real relationships in the house  Like who was  He made 
[01:53:30]  Who was the guy  The dumpy guy  Yeah all his friendships  That he made were all fake  They were all fake  And nothing  One of the writers  They brought him on  To be like a cast member  Uh huh  Because he was supposed to be  The best friend  And they really  Created a relationship  And then he was like  Yeah no I'm  Actually not only is this fake  But I wrote it  I wrote this  And I'm never  And I'm never gonna hang out with you  Our friendship is completely fake  This was a job for me  Is this the big reveal?  This was just his quote right now  No no 
[01:54:00]  I want where  The full scene?  Yeah  Because I don't know if Jimmy's ever seen this  I've never seen this  I only heard it because of you guys  You gotta watch it  Because it's real  Well because  Yeah  It parodies  All those reality shows before  Like the real world and all that  That's what made it  Yeah  Made it good for the time  Is this  Is this kind of like  And the same thing  Is what was Goldthwait's movie  Where the one guy  Didn't know that they were  Making a goof on him  Oh right  The um  Oh  One on a windy night in Chicago  Yes thank you  Is that what it's called?  Yes  Something like that 
[01:54:30]  Yes  Yes  It's very similar to that  Um  And then there were times  Where they almost blew it  Because like  But he couldn't figure it out  What was the  What was the one thing  That happened Sam?  Um  Yeah  There was like an old guy  And he was supposed to be  Like the veteran  Right  And he  He got like  They kept making mistakes  Like this guy  This guy just completely panicked  And fucked up  He goes like  Yeah I can't believe  So and so  They had to guess  Whose underwear was whose  That was the game  Right  The cast members  Were wearing other cast members 
[01:55:00]  Underwear  So stupid  And like  Really stupid shit  The guy goes  Yeah I can't believe  That the fish boxers  Were his  And Matt Kennedy Goal goes  Put the  Put the fish boxers  Were yours  Because the guy forgot  Which boxers  Were supposed to be his  Right right  There was some slip ups  Right  And he just pretended  He was old  He was like  Oh were they  Oh yeah yeah yeah  The fish boxers  Yeah they were mine  And Matt Kennedy Goal was just like  Oh well  Alright  I'll accept that  Just continuing to be really stupid  Anyone else would be like  What 
[01:55:30]  Alright what's up  You don't know that  Those were your boxers  He was the nicest guy  He was just trying to be nice to everybody  Like there were multiple times  Where they would set up something  That was supposed to be like  Offensive  Like the Hutch would say something  Anti-gay  Right  Right  The Hutch  And Matt Kennedy Goal  Joe Schmo  Would be like  Hey  That's not cool with me  I might have to  Is there a highlight reel  Buy Matt  Wait was the audience  In like  Was the viewing audience  In on the fact that  The whole thing  Oh yeah 
[01:56:00]  That's what made it great too  So everybody knew  The whole thing  Was a goof on the guy  And you know how we talk about  The new world we live in  And the PC and shit  They would not make a show  Like this anymore  They call it  And call it  The Joe Schmo  Schmo  This was mid 90's  I would say  It was 2003  Oh  No  Oh wait  Yeah okay  They tried  They did try to reboot it  And it just  People weren't  I mean  No cause they found  The perfect guy  Yeah  That'll never happen again  They blew it by doing 
[01:56:30]  Such a good job  That first season  Yeah  You think they should have  Filmed a couple  And then show it  Is there any Joe Schmo clips  There's a lot of  Like some of the goofy ones  It's flooded with stuff  From the third season  From the reboot  Oh no  Why would you do that  I just could show you  The real  Just  Yeah  What  Matt  Everyone  What is going on  What is going on 
[01:57:00]  That's a reveal  That's when he found out  The whole thing  Was a ruse  Wasn't one of the  Cast members  Supposed to be like  A Mormon  That was like a virgin  Yeah  With her  With her goofy  Boyfriend  Would come and sing  And stuff  She was a Mormon  Who was a virgin  But she was this blonde  With giant tits  Right  And they would make her  Walk around in bikinis  Tiny bikinis  Brilliant  She would talk about  How she's a virgin  And he would just  Get all horned up  But try to be respectful  Yeah 
[01:57:30]  Because he's just  A nice guy  Yeah  But they were just  Lying to him  The whole time  Yeah  Could you do the  Big reveal clip  That's as much as  They don't  We used to have  That clip online  What the fuck  Do they do  Bastards  Oh that's too bad  Yeah  Where they finally  Let him in on it  And he's just like  Oh my god  He looks like a fool  You can't make someone  Look like a fool  Anymore on TV  He was such a fool  A Windy City Heat  Someone said  Windy City Heat  Right right  Yeah because everybody's like  Used to like 
[01:58:00]  Undercover Boss  And shows like this  Where they would be  Tricking you  But then they spin it  And make you  You know  They take care of you  The best part about  The end of the show  Was that  I can't believe  We don't have the  No I mean it's all  It's all season 3 stuff  You don't want to watch  The season 3  No  They go  They go Matt  The whole show  It was all for you  We did this  Oh for you  Like the Hulk  Did it for us  Right  Knocking down the towers  And he's like 
[01:58:30]  You lied to me  You made me look  Like a fool  Yes we did  He was like upset  Yeah he was upset  He was upset  Someone said  Jessica Simpson's  Reality show  And also  Nick and Jessica  Were a couple  That might have  Oh right  Nick and Jessica  Yeah definitely  Yes  I forgot about  The Nick and Jessica  What was that show  Was it called  Nick and Jessica  Or no  There was a name for that  I forgot  I forgot what it was called  When she thought  Chicken of the Sea  Was chicken  She is dumb  She's extremely dumb 
[01:59:00]  I have children now  And I'm trying to get  My body back in the shade  She just sounds like  A tart  There was some book  Coming out on  Leno's Tonight Show  Like some producer  Wrote a behind the scenes  Oh right yeah  And one of the  I think one of the people  They talk about  Is Jessica Simpson  And they're like  There was one time  They wanted her  But she would only come  If they would pay  For her hair and makeup  Which was going to be  Like 18 grand  Geez  For hair and makeup  There was some  I don't know  What the whole story is  I probably should have  Learned more  Jesus  Her show was  Newlyweds 
[01:59:30]  Newlyweds  That's right  Yeah  Alright  She seems a bit  Out of it  At all times now  Yeah  She makes the gossip sites  Being all stumbly  And stuff  When she was in  That Duke's a Hazard movie  No  Holy mother of fuck  Exactly  That was  That was her  Like ultimate body  That she  Ever ever had  During that  Little time period  I can't believe  Apparently she had  Trouble keeping  That weight off  Yeah 
[02:00:00]  I can't believe  We can't find this  Sam  This was a waste of time  Without the clip  Without the big reveal clip  I'm thinking  I don't think so  We talked about it  Yeah  I guess  Reminiscing  But to see it  Is just amazing  And we got to see  The  What  What  What  What is going on  Here  What happened  To that guy  Nothing  He went back  To pittsburgh  He was working  A pizza place  That's right  What's he doing  In pittsburgh  I mean  Nothing  No one talks  About him  He doesn't show up 
[02:00:30]  Anywhere  Not in the business  Nothing  I think I have a number  For him  Do you want to call him  Yeah  Okay  You really think  You got a phone number  For him  I'm almost positive  Wow  Oh wow  He's a big star  What does he look like  Nowadays  Like some schmo  The Joe Schmo show  Yeah  He got married in 2008  He worked for a logistics company  Right  It's just some dude  Wow 
[02:01:00]  What a dull thing to do  That was legit  I work for a logistics company  I wonder if he hates those people  Like Kristen Wager  If they  There's a quote from 2008  Entertainment Weekly got to interview him  And he said  The show made him feel dumb  Well  And that if he was given the choice  To do it again  He wouldn't do the show at all  No shit  You were the joke  He was made the fool  Yeah  He's a fool  You never want to be a fool  No  And they just would not film a show like that 
[02:01:30]  Which is too bad  Because that was funny  Get it  Jim Tanning in jail  Oh  GT  J  Instead of GTL  That was just on Fox  GTL would have been  Oh GTL  Jim Tanning lock up  That's what they had on CNN  Oh really  Yeah  Oh they were with lock up  Yeah they were all going with the same thing  Oh that's smarter then  Of course  GTJ  J  Doesn't make sense  Alright  Yeah  Well that's it I guess  Oh man  I wanted the Joe Schmo  I can't believe that clip's not online 
[02:02:00]  That is just  What happened  Maybe they wanted to sell the DVD or something  And I mean  There aren't a lot of people like us  That still talk about this show  They should be  I was obsessed with it  Every week  I couldn't believe this was going on on TV  How long was it on?  It was a regular cycle  Probably 12 episodes or something  Yeah they did one  And then they did a second season  That didn't really work  And then like  Last year  They rebooted it  And that didn't really  Why didn't it work? 
[02:02:30]  Because people  I mean  Within the  They tried to do it with two people  Almost like a dating show  I think for the second season  And immediately  One of the  The girl  Figured out  That it was a Joe Schmo show  Everybody was faking it  Right  So then they tried to make the guy  Into Joe Schmo  But it was all like  They were writing it as they went  But  And it became way too complicated  To follow  But to be fair  The original Joe Schmo show  You just  They found a stupid guy  Yeah yeah  Because the acting in it was bad  Remember how bad the acting was 
[02:03:00]  And you're like  How is this guy not  Figuring this shit out?  It was really bad  They had like a  A sumo contest  And  Oh with those dumb big suits  Yeah  And I think if I remember right  Kristen Wiig  Had to pretend that  He had  Hit her too hard  And like she had hurt her head  And they just made him feel  All guilty for it  And everything  That's  Really mean shit they did  They just fucked with him  Yeah  Bad  Check it out 
[02:03:30]  I don't know  I don't know if it holds up  I'll be honest  100%  100% holds up  They were trying to do like  A Truman show thing I think  Yes  Yeah yeah  Like that was the whole  Gist of it  Because I think  When did that movie come out?  It was right around the same time  Yeah same time  A couple years  Somebody just thought  Why don't we really do this?  They just manipulate them  So  Fuck  It's like the Truman show  Except if we were making  A complete horse's ass  Out of Truman  Yeah  Right  Alright we should  Take a break  Gents of some other things  Certainly  We'll be back

[02:16:00]  Reportedly forced by DMV  To remove makeup  For driver's  License photo  Because he did not  Look the way  A boy should  A boy should  If it's not looking  The way you should  Because  Like that's what  You look like  I don't fucking know  If women can wear  Makeup  On their license  Then  Then why can't  Some dude  You know  Right  The guy wants  To wear makeup  And a girl  Takes her makeup off  She's not going to  Look exactly like  She looks with the makeup  I don't know  Can they wear makeup  Can a woman wear makeup 
[02:16:30]  That  That's a tough  Yeah I guess they can  Well he wasn't wearing  Makeup like prosthetic  Right  Make him look like  A different guy  Makeup  Right  So  That's a dick move  I don't know  That's a dick move  By DMV  Yeah cause I don't think  This guy was going  For the goof  If this kid was  Going for the goof  Then I could see  DMV going  Knock it off  This is serious  He kind of looked  Like a girl  Right  This is how he  Lives his life  So I think  They're just being a dick  They are dicks  But you have to say  How is DMV  Supposed to know that 
[02:17:00]  Like if I went in  And just said  Let's just say  I put in earrings  And lipstick  I know  I don't mean  To sexy the place up  But how do they know  That I'm not like  This is who I really am  Or I'm just  Fucking around  Right  But even if you're  Just fucking around  Like what's it to them  If you're not trying  To hide your identity  But does it make you  Look different enough  Where the cop  Can look at your license  And go  I'm just saying  I don't know if that's  How about you grow  A giant beard mustache  And then you fucking  Take your picture  For your license  And then you shave it off 
[02:17:30]  And never grow it again  That's true  I mean that to me  Would disguise who you are  More than anything else  Yeah  Right  I mean  Nah  What are you going to  A gender non-conforming teen  Is that what they're called now  I don't know what that means  How many fucking names  Are people going to come up  For their fucking things  That they are  A gender non-conforming teen  What is that  I don't know  Everyone wants to sound important  Like I'm a gender non-conforming  What does that mean  I don't know what that means  It's funny 
[02:18:00]  And then they'd be offended  If you didn't know that  No it's gender non-conforming  Is what I am  Oh sorry  Last week it was tranny  The week before it was something else  Too many names  I don't know  A gender non-conforming teen  Is fighting to retake  The driver's license picture  With the makeup  He says the South Carolina DMV  Forced him to take off  Chase  Culpepper  16  Who prefers male pronouns  What does that mean  Mr. or him  Or is that 
[02:18:30]  Oh no wait  Is it  If he prefers male pronouns  Then yeah  He prefers to be called  He and him  Oh okay  But it should be  What they prefer  But he dresses like a girl  That's why he's gender non-conforming  That's like  It sounds very similar  To gender queer  In the sense that  You do not abide by  The normal societal rules  Of gender  But then they get  Society  But they get mad  If people don't just honor  What you want to be  And people think  I have no labels  Other than the labels  I give myself  Yeah yeah  And you're all supposed 
[02:19:00]  Everyone's supposed to  Keep tabs on  Everyone's label of the day  And if you don't know it  You get in trouble  So is he a boy or a girl?  He's a gender non-conformist  Gender non-conformist  Can't we just  Can't you at least answer that question?  Are you a boy or a girl?  Option C  No I don't feel that way  It's an Adam's Apple American  He could say  I'll even accept him saying  I feel like a girl  I feel like is fine too  But is he a boy or a girl? 
[02:19:30]  Well he would say he's  Maybe he would say  He's genetically  His sex  Biologically  Biologically male  But boy is a social construct  I think at this point  I think at this point  We're just being fucked with  We are really being fucked with  I think we're just being fucked with  They're going to their meetings  And laughing about  What they can come up with next  Alright  This week we're going to be  Non-conforming teens  Yeah  A gender non-conforming teen  Alright  Everyone wants an important sounding  Yes  That's why people get mad at Tranny 
[02:20:00]  Because it's not vicious  It's not based in hatred or violence  No  But it just doesn't sound as important  No  Or as long as another  Sounds silly  Right  And that's all it is  Yeah  I don't know why we haven't talked about  The double tornado thing  That  You  That video  We got twins  Yeah  That video is amazing  Crazy right  And they say it's extremely rare  And they said the tornadoes  Were only a mile apart  Yeah  And huge  Massive tornadoes  A mile apart from each other  I think they were F4s 
[02:20:30]  They said  Both were F4s  Yeah  Is there a  What?  Is there an F5?  Oh  Shit  You almost broke your phone  I almost broke my phone  That F5  Do you know how  The joy that would give me  Oh that would have right  Yeah it's fine  F5  But that video  Wow  Chase Culpeppers  That's two fingers of God  That's like the shocker of God  Shit 
[02:21:00]  One of the pink one in the sink  Of God  Indeed  The Lord wants a little ass action  Yeah it's a little ass play  More storms are happening too  A Bruin  Yeah we're in tornado season so  Chase Culpepper 16  Who prefers male pronouns  Wears girls clothing  And makeup every day  As an outward expression  Of his inner self  But  But that's  Isn't everybody's clothing  An outward expression 
[02:21:30]  Of their inner self  What do you think?  It's so ridiculous  Just the language  And the description  And all the  All the details  How dare you laugh  At these kids  I just think it's funny  That you  It takes that much detail  To explain a person  Right  It's the self-importance  Yeah  Or the needing  A definition that is  Different than everyone else  Is the news story  On  Online?  This is a print version  I can  Because I saw a news story  About this on  Okay  In video  You know  It's kind of  Kind of cool  Kind of cool  To listen to the  The reporter 
[02:22:00]  Tiptoeing around  All the words  And yeah  It's just  Abomination  Like I say  Every time this comes up  We need more time  We need more time  As a society  To understand this  There's the story  You want to  Do it this way?  It's always kind of fun  There's some good stuff  In this version  Yeah  We can do both  Let me finish this  And then we'll go  To the news story  They're not mutually  Exclusive guys  Ah  Yeah  But that freedom  Was allegedly stifled 
[02:22:30]  On March 3rd  At the DMV  In Anderson  Stifled  Workers accused him  Of not looking  The way a boy should  And refused to take  His picture  While he was  Wearing makeup  He's pretty femmy  According  This is why  I wanted to read this  According to the  Transgender  Legal Defense  And Education Fund  Or  T-L-D-E-F  The gay people  Have the longest  Acronym  Ever  Enough  I can't even get it  The L-G- 
[02:23:00]  B-T-Q  B-T-Q  L-G-B-T  They keep adding  Fucking letters  To the end of it  Slow down  Is he gay?  He's not  He's a gender nonconformist  He's a gender nonconformist  So he's like  Eddie Izzard  He likes to wear  Like Edward  No  This guy is  Into dudes  Well he didn't say  He was into dudes  And you're making  Judgments  I am making  He shouldn't be judging  He's a gender  Nonconforming teen  Thank you  He loves the dick  But he wants to be  Called he  So he's not saying 
[02:23:30]  He's transsexual  He's saying  I'm a he  And I guess he likes women  But I want to dress this way  We don't know for sure  Oh we don't  Okay  Gender nonconformist  He's a gender  Nonconforming teen  He's like  Hey man  Don't put a label  On me man  Yeah  Thank you Opie  Maybe he swings both ways  Boys and men  You think  That's going to be  Do you think  It's going to be  An option  In a job  Application  Male  I think it's  All male  Gender nonconforming  Teen  Eventually yeah  They will have to  They'll cave into it 
[02:24:00]  Well no there is a thing  Where you can write  Male female  I prefer not to tell  Does that  Does that  I prefer not to tell  On many applications  Like for colleges  And stuff  You can prefer not to  I am so not hiring  Anyone that checks off  I prefer not to tell  Yeah yeah  I just want to say that  That's a simple  Simple question  On an application  Yeah  I'm dick  No dick  That should be the check box  If you check the  I prefer not to tell  I don't want anything  To do with you  Even  I was in college  Ten years ago  And they were  They were 
[02:24:30]  Trying to protest  That there should be  A third bathroom  Male  Female  And then  Other  Why  Because what about  Those that do not  So don't feel comfortable  In a male  Or female bathroom  I want a toilet  Like where you  Wash your hair  At the hair place  With the neck  With the neck thing  So you can just  Put your head in there  And get pissed on  Wouldn't that be great  You just fucking  Put your head back  Lean your head back  You joke  But  I think you could 
[02:25:00]  Try to design one  We go to the bathroom  Many times  Every day  There's gay guys in there  Pretty much every time  You go in  Pretty much  I couldn't jump on that  Fast  And  I don't give a  I don't care  But it's not for gay people  It's for trans  And genderqueer people  Nonconformists  Nonconformists  And is there a bit of  An excitement 
[02:25:30]  To the gay guys  Being in the bathroom  With straight guys  Jim  Well you know  It's funny  I'm a  I'm a nonconformist  But how does that work  Are they titillated a little bit  Because they're in a bathroom  With straight guys  You would think  That if you're attracted  To men  Being able to go in  The men's room  Would be something  That would be a little exciting  If I was allowed  To go into the ladies room  And listen to girls  Pissing  And fucking 
[02:26:00]  They come out  Pulling their pants up  And shit like that  It would be  Exciting  In some way  Shape or form  Sexually  There would be some  Titillation going on  Exactly  So why don't we  Give a fuck  I don't know  And why should  Other people  Give a fuck  Guys don't really care  But girls don't care either  If there's a lesbian  No girls would care a lot  If all of a sudden  Guys were going  No there were lesbians  But if there's a lesbian  In the bathroom  Girls don't give a shit  About that  And if there's a guy  That's gay in the bathroom  Unless you're one of these  You know  Gay bashers 
[02:26:30]  You know  I don't want no  Queer  You don't care either  For the most part  No one gives a shit  That is a weird thing  Like if you're a male  You're supposed to be comfortable  If there's a gay guy  In the locker room  And that's fine  Even though you know  That you're in his  Sexual attraction range  Right  But as a woman  You know  You can't say  Well you have to be  Comfortable with a male  In the locker room  Right  Because you're in his  Sexual attraction range  Right  You're still in that  You know  You're attracted to  That type of person  And they'll say  Well the threat of 
[02:27:00]  And we're not talking  Oh right  Yeah  Oh if you  If you even  Discuss it  Openly  You mean  You want to  Punch people  In the face  That seems to be  The way we operate  In this day and age  Talk about it  You want to  Punch them in the face  I like to announce  Loudly  I bet you would  Like a look  At this  You're usually  In a stall  That would be great  I bet you would  Love to gaze  At this  Oh man  I'm holding  A treat  In my hand  I don't know 
[02:27:30]  So where are we  Alright so we're up  To the TLDF  Which is the  Transgender Legal Defense  And Education Fund  The government should not  Be in the business  Of telling men and women  How we are supposed  To look as men and women  Michael Silverman  Executive director  Of TLDF  Told the Daily News  Michael or Michelle  I have no idea  Chase wiped the makeup  From his face  And removed the mascara  From his eyelashes  Posed for the picture  And took home his license 
[02:28:00]  But he wasn't  Happy  TLDF  Says the DMV  Stifled the teen boy's  Freedom of gender expression  Deliberately suppressing  The more feminine  And  Wait gender  What?  Gender expression  Is that what it is?  Gender expression?  Gender expression  Deliberately suppressing  The more feminine  And  Androgynous  Thank you  Aspects of his personality  Holy fuck  We want  We want Chase 
[02:28:30]  To be able to go back  To the DMV  In Anderson  His hometown  And have his photo  Taken  The way he looks  Every day  With makeup on  I could give a shit  Go ahead  Take it  If women can wear  Makeup on their  Fucking license picture  And you're a dude  And that's how you dress  And you know  You want to be a chick  Fuck it  Wear makeup  Who cares  Like I said  It's not like  They're putting on  Fake nose  And eyebrows  And shit like that  I saw the picture  It's subtle makeup  Too  You would still  Be able to  Recognize the guy  Or the  Or the what  The non-conforming teen 
[02:29:00]  He's okay with  Gender non  He prefers male  Pronouns  He's a gender  Non-conformist  A gender  Non-conforming teen  Play the video  And you'll see  Because if you say  The wrong thing  All of a sudden  You're hateful  Yes  Like if you don't  That's the problem  The DMV  They are dicks  Yeah  But you can't expect  Everybody just to know  This stuff  And there are people  That just don't understand  What it is you're doing  It doesn't mean  Everyone's a fucking  Sexophobe or hateful  Exactly  Is this reporter  Actually walking  Toward the camera  Yes  Doing that move  Are they still doing this 
[02:29:30]  You don't like that  In three  Two  One  I'm here at the bar  Yeah  Walking talking  Yep  Doing the walking talking  Let's see her  Walking talking  Toward the camera  He's the first to tell you  That it's complicated  And the pullback of the camera  Jake Culpepper says  That he was worried  About passing the test  Not taking his photo  But he says  That excitement  Faded when he was told  That if he wanted  His driver's license  He would have to  Change his appearance  Wow  Show the ignition  Driving is a coming of age 
[02:30:00]  I was nervous  For driving  Before the test  A taste of independence  He's gay right  He's a gender nonconformist  We've already been over this  That is  That's gay  That's gay  Right  He's got  The gay voice  The gay voice  And the gay face  He's got  The gay voice  The gay voice  Nine out of ten times  When you hear that voice 
[02:30:30]  The person's  I mean right  Exactly  But not every  Gay  Gay guy  Sounds like that  That's very true  He's pulling it off  You know  I've seen worse  Oh yeah  I've paid worse  He's quite a delight  Chase  Chase  Yes  Alright  Yeah  This cautious  Young driver  Aced the test  With a perfect score  The photo  Is what caused  A roadblock 
[02:31:00]  At the Anderson DMV  A roadblock  He said that  I could not wear a disguise  To take my photo  He's cute  And according to her  Like me wearing makeup  Would be a disguise  Tell Chase I said what's up  Chase  And that I did not look like a boy should  Chase shared these before and after photos  To him this was not about deception  To not wear makeup  Yeah  It's a fucking chick  That's very  That's very close  That's a chick  And the makeup  You're right  That makeup is not  Caked on  Or crazy  The before and after  So close 
[02:31:30]  It's not that different  It's not different at all  Yeah you should be able to do that  Which proves that the DMVs  They're dicks  They're dicks  Yeah  It's probably  You know what it is  It wasn't like you had clown makeup on  Guaranteed  Really  It was probably some ugly chick  At DMV  That was pissed off  That this dude was prettier  Than her  Way prettier  Or some guy  Fighting the tent  In the front of his pants  Yes maybe that's  Not unlike some people  In this room  Take that makeup off  You fucking  You gotta look like a boy  Yes  I can't handle this  Yeah 
[02:32:00]  Freaking out  That he's getting the heart on  Yeah  But the other side of it  Yeah  I think there's a lot of people  That go to DMV  And try to fuck around  With their pictures  Yes  You think  So I think they're used to  Having to tell people  Like knock it off  But they got caught  Because this kid really  Wasn't going for any  Fucking joke  This is who he really is  It would be such an obvious  If you really want to have  A serious conversation about it  I bet the DMV deals  With that shit a lot  Because how cool is it  When every once in a while  You see someone's driver's license  And they were doing something goofy  And you always say 
[02:32:30]  How the fuck  Did you pull that off  Yeah  I have a great driver's license photo  That I kept the face on  The entire time  Just so I could do it  Yeah  A big  You never seen my photo  Oh what did you do  You've probably seen it  It's that big dumb smile  Oh yeah  Your big dumb smile  Stuff like that  Which is by the way  Supposed to be against the rules  You're not supposed to smile  Well it is  That's from a few years ago  It is now  Yeah  You're not allowed to smile  Right  You're smiling  Or you can't show your teeth  Or something  You look different  I had to take my glasses off  Oh  Why  That's bad  They said you can't have anything  On your face  Oh 
[02:33:00]  Except cum  Exactly  Bukkake  Did you take off  That white clown makeup  Well you might be  There's a little  Misunderstanding here  Alright we gotta go  With this guy  Oh shit  Yeah  Yeah you know  We are hurt in the south  After all  Oh  Dan and Flora  Let it rip  Go ahead Dan  Hey how's it going guys  Good morning  Hello  Hey  Quick question  If it's okay  For one  For the guy to wear makeup  You know  Anthony going back 
[02:33:30]  To your conversation  How about a girl  Who comes in  With a beard and mustache  To use your exact words  Would that be okay  Or would they make her  Remove that  Like a fake beard and mustache  I would assume  They would make her  Remove that  Because it's coming off  As a disguise  And not you know  A natural  But how do they  They don't know that  The second point  I want to make  I'll get off  I want to bounce  Wait wait  Well you gotta slow down  I think everyone's  I think everyone's  In agreement  Hold on  I think everyone's  In agreement  That you can't show up  At the DMV  With a fake beard and mustache  Yeah no one can do that 
[02:34:00]  But a girl  But a girl  Could wear makeup  Yeah  And he's wearing makeup  It's the same thing  But they don't know that  It's not a fake makeup thing  To them  I mean if he showed up  With Halloween makeup  They'd say take it off  Yeah I know what you're saying  But when you look  At the before and after  Like that was my first thought  Right  When you look at the before and after  It's so close  It's not at all different  It didn't make  A difference  Yeah it didn't make  A difference at all  I prefer to have dinner  With the one on the left  However they are not that  Because it comes down to  A cop's pulling you over 
[02:34:30]  And they want to see your license  So whether this kid  Has makeup on or not  It's the same person  You would not be tricked by  You know that's him  Right  Thank you  The problem we have  In this country  We're all looking for  These set black and white rules  This or this  This or that  And there's a grey area  In everything  Where common sense  Has to take over  The person behind the counter  At Motor Vehicle  If they look at a woman  Wearing a fake beard  And mustache  Yeah  Take that off  Why?  Well you're in a disguise 
[02:35:00]  If this dude comes in  With makeup on  And looks like a pretty girl  Then you fucking  Let him take the picture  Right  There's common sense  You just said a moment ago  That if a guy comes in  With a beard and a mustache  It's okay  Yes because you're using  Common sense  Guys will grow beards and mustache  They do change their look  Not to avoid a prosecution  Most of the time  Just because  They're changing their look  Their hairstyle even  Things like that  It's common sense  To allow a man  That has a beard 
[02:35:30]  Or to take a picture  Like that  Even though he could  Shave the beard off  It's not common sense  To allow a woman  To wear a fake beard  That's just how it is  You should be able to  Use some brain power  In your job  And not look to this  Almighty book of rules  Throw it away  Throw it out  Get a new rule book  Get a new rule book  Throw it out  Okay  Gilly  But you're not allowed  To use common sense  No  No  You'll get in a lot  Of trouble for trying  To use common sense  It's like religious freedom  You're allowed to have 
[02:36:00]  Religious freedom  But like  If you wore a yarmulke  For your licensed photo  Because it wouldn't  It wouldn't interfere  With your photo  You're allowed to  But it's like  Remember that Muslim woman  Fought to wear her  What's that?  The burka lady  Yeah but I don't think  You're allowed to do that  No  So her religious freedom  Isn't as good  Because common sense dictates  Religion or not  We have to see your face  For a photo  We have to  Correct  It's part of the reason  There's a picture on there  You're arguing like  13 year old Jimmy Norton  The other part of it is 
[02:36:30]  And I apologize  To Stephanie  You got a lot of coffee  This morning  But a driver's license  Is not a right  It's a privilege  So if you want to be  A non-conformist  If you want to do  Whatever you want to do  To express yourself  That's fine  You just don't get  A driver's license  Because a driver's license  Is used as a visual  Identification  For financial institutions  For military  For police  For anything like that  It needs to be something  That's easily identifiable  It's a necessity  It's not a privilege even  It's a necessity  To have ID  And it's a tricky situation  To have the state  Dictate what you can 
[02:37:00]  And can't wear  Religiously  On certain  Identifications  It's a tricky  And Dan  Have you seen the picture  Of this kid  I have not  No I've been driving  It's so  He has just very simple  Makeup on  Very basic  Yeah it's really  It's really light  It's really light  It wouldn't make  A drastic change  In his appearance  Whatsoever  It's like a chick  On the right  Right  And I wonder if  I wonder if  The transgender people  That can't pull it off 
[02:37:30]  Look at people  That can pull it off  And go like  Fuck man  Yeah like  Like dudes  That just  Oh my god  That's a dude  In a dress  With a wig on  Yeah  Do they look  And get a little jelly  You think they get  A little jelly  Yeah  I mean that's like  If a girl  Sees a really hot girl  Like oh  She gets pissed off  I wish I looked like that  I'll bet  Yeah I bet  Someone told me recently  That lesbians  Not all  Pillow talk  Yeah  A hardcore  Lesbians sometimes  Don't like  Like transgendered 
[02:38:00]  People in the LGBT  They think it takes away  I was really shocked  To hear that  Wow  Is there a whole thing  Going on in there  Like the  Like black people  Have like darker black people  And lighter black people  Rivalries  I don't know  I guess  I mean  This is the first I heard  Pretty guy  Transsexual  Will piss off  Ugly lesbian  That  It's like rock paper scissors  Yeah I don't know  If that was it  Or if it was  They felt that  Cock paper scissors  Taking away from the  I don't know  I don't know  A girl told me  I'll be able to say  Oh okay  I think she just knew 
[02:38:30]  People who said that  Yeah  Gotcha  There we go  Listen let me bounce  Oh my god  This guy's just talking  You guys rock  Over Howard Stern  Ten times better  Love you  Love you  Love you  Thank you sir  Yeah we appreciate it  We know a lot of you guys  Are coming on board  Oh yes  Welcome aboard  That's right  Take care  Thanks Dan  Now get back to this  Adorable person  This doll  Exactly  Suddenly Jim Norton  Doesn't seem so crazy  Does he  Let's go back to  Your news story  Yeah  Alright  He was honest 
[02:39:00]  And told DMV employees  That he is male  And reluctantly  He took off his makeup  So that he could get  His first driver's license  It was very degrading  And I felt  I was in shock  The 16 year old  Once so eager to drive  Now regrets changing his look  To please the state  He is fighting for the chance  To retake his driver's license photo  With makeup  Like he wears everyday  It was incredibly  What's that  Devastating  For the Culpepper family 
[02:39:30]  It's more than just hurt feelings  They call it discrimination  Where's dad  This is who he is  And for him to not have makeup on  Would be in disguise in itself  State officials say  Thank you for her  What did Teresa Culpepper do  Early on  How dare you  Yes I'm implying that  Something must have happened  In the  Really  Nurture portion  Not the nature portion  You're implying that  His behavior is a reaction  To negativity  Instead of just  Maybe naturally who he is  Maybe a little too much  Cattling 
[02:40:00]  Is that what happens  A little too much  Cattling by mommy  I don't think so  He was always  He was meant to  That's in the DNA  He was meant to be that way  The voice  The mannerisms  Ah yeah  I hear you  Continue  Oh that was it  No  Oh  So we're done with that  Great  Wow  Oh no we're not  Wow  Are we done with that  Okay good  What  Oh this is the DMV  Policies  At no time  Will an applicant  Be photographed  When it appears  That he or she  Is purposely altering  His or her appearance 
[02:40:30]  So that the photo  Would misrepresent  His or her identity  Alright pause that  The DMV does however  That's the statement  That doesn't  We get that  We know  But that's not happening here  No common sense  Tells you that  That means  Coming in with a prosthetic  Nose  Chin  Fake mustache  Eyebrow  All that shit  If you look at somebody  And go  Alright  They are trying  To misrepresent  Who they are  Use common sense  Know it  That kid  Is just  Wearing makeup  That obviously  He wears everyday 
[02:41:00]  It's not meant  To try to fool anybody  That's ridiculous  Come on people  Let's fucking think  What a bunch of dummies  In this country now  What a country of dummies  Looking for  People to tell us  What we're supposed to do  Think  Fuck  Thank you  Good for you  I know  Good for me  You're an ally  That was strong  Yes  That was really strong  Anthony for president  Let's get the  Let's get the rest of this  Would that be a horrible thing 
[02:41:30]  Yes  Oh my god  Yeah we wouldn't like that  Anthony for councilman  Would be a horrible thing  Yes  Dog catcher  Right  Dog catcher  We wouldn't like that  We would hate it actually  The selectman  I wouldn't make a good selectman  Is that it  No  Keeps going on and on  Grand wizard  I take offense to that  Let's go  Exceptions for medical  And religious reasons  I'm sharing my story 
[02:42:00]  Because I just don't want  To see other people  Like me  Have to get through this  What he wants now  Is to steer the entire state  In a new direction  Steer  One that takes the focus  Off of looks  And labels  Why do they have to do that  Giving special consideration  He's driving  To see themselves differently  Than society  He needs tits  And because DMV employees  Followed policy  Sorry  Blurred about that  I thought I fought it  According to state officials  That Chase will get to retake that photo  Without a battle  The family says  It is considering the possibility 
[02:42:30]  Of legal action  But I can't  I can't  Even though common sense  And I'm always on  Like the side  Of you know  Like give them a break  Like I'm not going to kill DMV  Because they do deal  With this shit all the time  And this guy  Happened to be legit  Right  But they can't always tell  If you're being legit  Or if you saw some guy  Behind the counter  He's like  Hey he's just trying  To fuck around  And he made a dumb call  But it wasn't like  We need to talk to someone  That works at the DMV  I bet you  Will tell us  That they deal with  A lot of people 
[02:43:00]  Just trying to pull shenanigans  To get laughs  From their friends  And it's like  Because they don't  They just  They've made a mistake here  I don't know  And that guy comes up  And says  I'm here for my license  You'd be like  All right  Exactly  And leave your number here  Just in case  It's not like  Some fucking  Guy with his frat buddies  Laughing on the bench  Behind him  Going  Take my fucking bitch  That goes back  To your common sense  Yeah  Right  But I mean  We've all been in  DMV  Is there common sense  Going on in there 
[02:43:30]  There is no type of sense  Going on in there  You want to talk about  Assholes  Mutants  That are on a power trip  Go ahead Kenny  Back in the day  Oh I don't know  Back in the day  Look  There's no wire  In your mic  It's not plugged into anything  Because I have to use  That microphone Kenny  Maybe you could share  Maybe you could share  With young Sam Roberts  Back in the day  It's a wireless mic  It certainly is  Back in the day  I had to take Andrew  To renew his license  Oh shit 
[02:44:00]  And they let him  Take his picture  With a smoking cigarette  Hanging out of his mouth  That's what I'm talking about  Yeah  Guys  Trying to goof around  And Jim  Don't you have a big smile  On your face  I do  But mine was again  A few years ago  I have it on file  I look really  Every time I hand it  Like in the airport  They always get  Like a kick out of it  They laugh  You were happy  Yeah  Happy boy  Fat pig I was  Happy boy fat pig  Okay  Hold on  Oh yeah  Thank you Kenny  Craig 
[02:44:30]  In North Carolina  Craig  Craig  What's up guys  Hey buddy  How's it going guys  Sorry I'm a little nervous  But there's a couple guys  In Richmond  A few years ago  They posted  There's a video online  They got six driver's license  I think in one day  Wearing ridiculous costumes  Worth looking up  I think it's  DMV driver's license  Prank  We gotta add that  To the discussion  DMV deals with this shit 
[02:45:00]  Caution is the key word  Oh I hate Craig  Schenkel  Sorry  Oh  The death of Craig  Schenkel  Schenkel  Schenkel about it  Whatever it is  Schenkel about it  Oh come on  That guy did not  Take a picture like that  Come on  Let's go to Paul  In Jersey  Paul  Hey buddy  Wait  Wait  Like a stereotypical  Insult of a Chinaman  Let me get to Paul first 
[02:45:30]  And then we'll get to that  Go ahead Paul  So  Okay so you have all these  Freak shows  You know  Oh I'm transgender  I'm gender non-conformist  Now let's see if you  Seriously have a guy  You know  A white guy  You know  White has clan sheets  And he just turns around  And says  You know what  Deep down inside  I really think  I'm a black guy  And he comes to DMV  The right shoe polish  And basically puts on  A minstrel show  But I mean  He's more sincere though  And he just decides  I'm really black  And this is how  I see myself  Kind of like how 
[02:46:00]  The queers see themselves  They really see themselves  As  As  You know  Not what they  Were born as  So  Why can't  Why can't they  Why can't they  Do a guy do that  Or a girl do that  Say hey  I'm really black  The question  That's not a bad question  Like  What's the difference  How do you know  I'm butchering  What you just said  But that's not a bad question  Like why can't you  Do that with race  If you can do it  With gender  Especially if it's  Just how you see yourself  With a sexuality  Yeah  I mean  The shoe polish is silly  But if you say like 
[02:46:30]  Say you come in  And you say like  No  I feel like I'm  African American deep down  And I want to be  Classified as such  You're going to  Check it on your  Application or something  Or you're tan  You're naturally tan  You're just a naturally  Olive skinned guy  What's to prevent you  From doing that  Getting charm  But why did you have  To say queers  Yeah  What  Well I don't believe in  You know  It's really good  Correct myself  I just  You know  I believe in saying  Coach  Crying out loud  I don't know  But that's  That's it for crying out loud  Instead of for crying out loud  Yes  I believe in saying  Kikes for Pete's sake  This doesn't sound right 
[02:47:00]  Sorry  Right  All right Paul  Thank you  But he said queers  In a hateful way  He did  It did  Didn't it sound a little  It was a little hateful  Goddamn queers  Yeah  That sounded a little hateful  Eddie in North Dakota  Eddie  It's your turn  What do you got buddy  So would like  Poison in the late 80s  Be gender nonconformist  They look like chicks  But they want to be called dudes  And they're still pulling ass  And they were still getting the broads 
[02:47:30]  Yep  Even though they were dressed like that  That's pretty impressive  That was an odd time  Where girls would look at guys  That looked like that  And be like  Oh that's the type of guy  You know  I want  What the Femmes  Rocking  Femmes  The Femmes  Look at the Femmes over there  We would watch bands  With like that  Fucking big  Poofy  Ridiculous  Poodle hair  And think  That guy rocks  Right  It just look  It look ridiculous  Right  The 80s rock look 
[02:48:00]  Just doesn't hold up  No  The ripped shirt  And the bad guitar movements  In the video  You could go back  To the 70s  And aside from  You know  Certain hairstyles  And facial hair  Things like that  But the clothing  I'm not talking about  Disco or anything  Just you know  Your basic bands  Of that era  It's pretty standard  And accepted  The 80s though  Man  The whole decade  Of the 80s  Was like  They were trying  To jump into the future  A little too fast  Like it's the 80s 
[02:48:30]  We gotta  You know  We need pointy shoulders  And things that look like  We belong on a spaceship  Are you talking about  Flock of Seagulls?  Flock of Seagulls  Bam  Bam  Bam  Bam  Greatest band of all time  Bam  Bam  Bam  Bam  Flock of Seagulls  Greatest band of all time  What?  Are you really saying that?  Yes I am  That's crazy  We all know who the first super group of all time was  Flock of Seagulls?  Asia  Led Zeppelin?  Asia  Who?  Stones?  Greatest band of all time  Flock of Seagulls  That's ridiculous 
[02:49:00]  Wow  It's not  And I ran  I ran so far away  Bam  Bam  I like the video  It's just them spinning around  With him putting one finger on the keyboard  And the camera in the middle  Because the camera was in the middle of the room  Right  So they tried to hide it with tinfoil  Can you go to the video Sam?  What are you doing?  Flock of Seagulls?  Yeah  It's the greatest band of all time  It's wrong with you  Stop fucking around over there  What are you doing?  Not much of an argument here  You can't really be texting anybody 
[02:49:30]  You have no friends  Why are you mocking us  That we want to watch the Flock of Seagulls  I ran video  Bam  Bam  To pointing out what Ant said  Where the camera  This giant camera's in the middle of the room  And they still want to do that spin shot  Yeah  And they try to hide the camera  But they did a horrible job doing it  They should have hit it with plates of mirrors  That would have looked better  Exactly  But it looked stupid  With the giant camera  Covered in tinfoil  Not only the greatest band of all time  It also goes to Ant's point  That everyone was trying to  Push into the future a little too fast 
[02:50:00]  Yeah  Because this is like  Oh these guys got to be from out of space  With that hairdo  No one would have that on planet Earth  Right  Yeah  Push play  Oh yeah  Look at that  See and look at the camera  Behind it  In the middle of the room  Covered in tinfoil  The tripod's covered in tinfoil  I can't see it  Sam you're ruining everything  Sam what are you doing  Stop breaking everything  I'm looking  Did you fuck that up  Sam  What are you doing  You're ruining things  Oh there it is  There you go  Thanks  Good job  Look at that  Futuristic 
[02:50:30]  And they were all androgynous  Because that's what the future was supposed to be  There's the camera  The camera's spinning  There's the camera  Fuck yeah  It's covered in foil  Oh my god  This used to be all the fucking time  This was a huge hit back then  Why don't they use a little GoPro  Yeah just use a GoPro  A girl like you  Needs a girl like you  You're shouting  That's how they did it in the 80s 
[02:51:00]  The kind of eyes that hypnotize me through  Hypnotize me through  Oh look at the makeup  It looks like the Blade Runner  Yeah that's good shit  Look the set is shaking  The whole set is shaking  All the mirrors  It's ready to fall down  This is ridiculous  Nice  Dan Dan Dan Dan  Oh look  Futuristic girls  They look like space people 
[02:51:30]  Right  They are space people  It was the 80s  Jimmy  There's a bunch of mirrors  And tinfoil  All earth things  They use tinfoil though  Bam bam bam  What is this strange  Metallic  Substance  It really does look like  He's spinning though  Yeah it's pretty good  Oh he actually is there  Yeah he's on a turntable  God am I dumb  Sam laughs  But you know damn well 
[02:52:00]  Jay Z will be sampling this  Soon enough  Yeah exactly  Yeah yeah  Yeah yeah  Yeah yeah  I ran so far away  This was sampled a long time ago  By who  I don't even remember  You can't just say that  He's stumbling in a mirrored area  You can't just say it was sampled a long time ago  But you don't remember  Why  I feel like we're exposing people to something new  But the futuristic drum he's playing  It's crazy  They're electronic  They're so confused in the mirrors  There's me again  He didn't know where to go 
[02:52:30]  And there's the crazy future of space girls  That's right  Yeah looking at the man on tinfoil  And they spray painted around their eyes  Like they got the  Like makeup around their eyes  Like they have sunglasses on  But they don't have sunglasses on  Futuristic space makeup  Oh no  You're either a space lady  Or just a lady with eye makeup  Yes I can't tell  In a room of mirrors  And they had the electronic drums  Which were so weird back then  Real drummers hated those things  Sure  They made that 
[02:53:00]  I hate the way they do  Peering from my view  Peering from my view  Peering  Giant  Beam of light with you  You know like the way he plays the keyboard  Massive  It's great  The tinfoil they covered  That's why fucking  That's why there's no reality TV back then  Yeah  Taking a smaller camera than that  They want big cameras back then  They can't figure out how to get out of the room  No  Yes it's mirrors 
[02:53:30]  Future space girls are on them  I must have seen this video 8 million times  Absolutely  Back in the early 80s on MTV  This one was heavy rotation  It was right?  Yeah  Oh god yeah  Oh look at that waveform on the bottom  That's futuristic  Wow the guy's wearing sunglasses while playing the bass  Insane  But what's the point?  I have no idea  Are they trying to get out of the room?  Like all the other videos back then  It had no point  I don't know why we're watching this 
[02:54:00]  Surprised that it was like  It's 80  What is this?  Like 84?  No this is before 84  This is like 81  This was like right when MTV started  82  The latest I would say  I would go 82  Really?  Let's go 82  97 I see  Pick it up  I'm going 82  Comes in for you  I like that  I liked safety dance  I fucking love the safety dance  Safety dance  You like the safety dance  I fucking ruled  You can leave your world behind 
[02:54:30]  Yeah just dancing around a big pole  Having a ball  Safety dance  Lots of grass  Yes  They weren't the greatest band of all time  Like Flock of Seagulls though  Aha  Take on me  We've done this break  Yeah right  A lot of times  Someone get on the fucking international phone  To Iraq  And ask him if we've done this bit  Supposedly someone  Ran into Iraq  In Rome  In Rome  Is that true?  They're dead  The choir's destroyed  Huh? 
[02:55:00]  There's a photo on ONA show  On Twitter  That we posted earlier this morning  That Ant also  We retweeted Ant's thing  Yes  What did you say about it?  I just said  Game set and match  Because it's a picture of him  In Rome  Rome  A fan found him in Rome  And took a photo  And Instagrammed it  Yeah  And he's mad at us  Because we figured out where he was  He looks mad?  Oh yeah  How do you know?  He's mad  Oh  That we were fucking with another one of his vacations  There he is in the Coliseum  We're not really fucking with his vacation though  They call him gladiated 
[02:55:30]  We didn't fuck with his vacation  No  We're going with the fact that he's mysterious again with everybody  Very mysterious  How do you know he's mad though?  He might not be mad  Very vague  He looks happy there  There are text messages coming in  Oh no  What did he say?  How did he find out?  I need to know exactly what was said on the show this morning  Who gives a shit? 
[02:56:00]  I said  Why do you care?  I said write back and tell him to have a good time in Italy and relax  He's in Italy  He did it to himself  Because he told half the staff he was going to Florida  Yeah  He told the bosses  Not that anyone respects them  But he didn't even fill out a vacation request form  No he did not  And then it was told to make sure you don't tell me or the rest of the guys where he's going  It's like James Bond  So of course that's going to get us a talking about it, no?  Of course 
[02:56:30]  That's what happened  If he just said, hey man, I'm going to Italy  See you in a week  We didn't even know he was going on vacation  No  Right  So, you know, that would be discussion for a show like this  He's unreachable  Why does he care?  We're not fucking with him  Doesn't matter what we say here  He's there having fun  Right  He doesn't have his number on his voicemail anymore  So that can't happen again  I understand why he might be a little skittish  But  We're not actually fucking with his time over in Italy 
[02:57:00]  No  Mamma me  But that kid really ran into him in Rome  That's pretty crazy  Yeah  What was he like  Could you imagine E-Rock just like  Walking around  And the guy goes  Hey, E-Rock  In Italy  Right  Fuck  How did you know I was here?  I need to know exactly what was said  Yes  Well, then listen to the replay  Yeah, there you go  It's all right here  Yeah  Recorded  Exactly  We're not hiding it  We're not whispering it  Poor E-Rock  Gladiated 
[02:57:30]  Gladiated  We're not entertained  He appears to be wearing a Kabbalah bracelet  What?  What's that?  That red thing  The Jewish  Is that one of Judaism?  Yeah, Madonna  What the fuck?  It's Madonna's deal  Why is he wearing that?  Is he on tour with Madge?  No, no  Could we call him?  Did he do something like  Let's give him a ring  Convert?  Let's call the hotel  Is that something you get at the Vatican?  Can we call him at least?  Call his cell phone at least  Yeah, let's give him a look  If he's out and about  Maybe he'll answer 
[02:58:00]  Yeah  I would assume  This is just me  I would assume that he's on his way back  Because if he's coming back tomorrow  To work  So maybe he's at the airport  Just waiting for a ring ding from a friend  That's true  Exactly  I hope he's been fucking pushed  Like off to another flight  I got it  Did you see somebody  When we were  What do you mean to say that?  Who?  A ring ding  What do you mean?  I like when we were wondering where he was  And some people had suggestions  That he was obviously in Hungary  Right  And then somebody else said  Said he went to the whaling wall 
[02:58:30]  But they spelt whaling different  Iraq's European vacation  Yeah  Secret European vacation  Very secret  Extremely secret  I don't like the face  Iraq makes the point  When he takes a picture  Because he's probably like  Who's this guy?  How did he know I was here?  That's what you do though  Like hey  Same way Iraq  Both make faces  When they take pictures  So do you  You make a big goofy smile  But I'm happy  No it's over the top  You're making a face  It's happy go lucky  It's not happy go lucky at all  It's a big toothy smile  That you never make in life 
[02:59:00]  I wear life like a loose fitting garment  That's like  I was thinking of that saying  You know  You gotta live life  Every day  Like it's your last day on earth  That would be  Raping every semi-attractive girl  And killing people  That I barely  Don't like  I wouldn't do that on my last day  The last day on earth  Live every day  Like it's your last day on earth  It's your last day  How about some rape?  You're not supposed to want to rape people  The only reason you don't rape  Shouldn't be just because you have more life to live 
[02:59:30]  And you should not rape because it's wrong  I think  It's the same theory I have about your dreams  Where the minute you find out you're dreaming  I'm dreaming I just grab  If it wasn't punishable by law  That means that you would rape  They're not real people in his dream though  That's true  They're not real people  I'm kind of with him  The last day of my life  I'm killing people  If they say live every day like it's your last  That doesn't mean you're fucking, you know  Joking around with your pals  You're doing shit like fucking  Crazy ass shit  That's it, last day  Here we go 
[03:00:00]  Here we go, motherfucker  This is all the stuff I wanted to do  This is some fucking crazy shit  You're supposed to make your dreams come true  Yeah  You spend your last day in central booking  Like you shoot one person  And get arrested  And then you just spend your last day  In a fucking dirty cell  Waiting for your lawyer  That might not be good  It wouldn't be fun at all  You can eat pizza  I got a tweet to read  From good old Tank Rizzo  He's a good egg on the Twitter  Since Not Sam is a lazy slacker  Here's the song that samples I Ran  Oh 
[03:00:30]  It's Slim Thug  And he renamed it I Run  Oh no  Can we hear some of that?  Slim Thug, I Run  Yeah, yeah  I'm sure he talks it up at the beginning  Yeah, yeah, yeah  Oh boy  That's it  I've run  It's  Gia  Gia  What year is this?  Slim Thug  What?  Is this English?  Yes it is  What?

I didn't like that part  Why don't you stop mocking our bands, Sam?  I'm not going to stop mocking Flag of Seagulls  All the hip hop guys are taking our bands 
[03:03:00]  Right?  Flag of Seagulls is maybe the most mocked band of all time  Most mocked?  Yeah, they suck  Well, Slim Thug liked it  That'll happen if you're the greatest band of all time  Damn  Oh, people get jealous  Yeah, they're a little jealous  You know what word rappers never use?  Frequently  I've never heard a rapper use the word frequently  Yeah  That's true  It's very hard to rhyme  Ambiguous  That's a word you don't hear  Ambiguous  No, no  Alright  Yeah  I got a we  Let's go we 
[03:03:30]  Skedaddle  I've never heard that in a rap  Yeah  Love to  Maybe ambig-u-is  I've never heard a real word in a rap song  I bet ambiguous has been used in some weird rhyme scheme  Yeah  But skedaddle has not  Skedaddle  Nor has frequently  Yeah, yeah, yeah  You best skedaddle  Skritty-politty  Yeah  No  You know what expression has ever been used in a rap?  Oh  Hedging your bets  Hedging your bets?  Never  I bet there's been a rapper who says, I hedge my bets 
[03:04:00]  No  Oh, man  They might  They might  I bet a hedge  Oh, yeah, it's probably some reversal  What?  I hedge my bets, but I bet my hedges  What?

[03:18:00]  A follow-up  Hit  Sort of  Falling in love  You know it  Oh, yeah  Space Age love song 
[03:18:30]  That's right  Yes  Whatever happened to these guys?  Did time just take them out?  Or is it one of those stories  Where it's like  Yeah, the bass player  Became a nuclear physicist  Right  It's like a bunch of 80s people  Became things  I bet you have a hit in the 80s  Or any time  And then you go away  It becomes like a really weird thing  Where the singer thinks 
[03:19:00]  It's their fault  And they think  You probably start to blame  Each other in a band  Really?  Yeah, I'm guessing  But some of these bands  Never went away  Just  We just  Don't care anymore  But they become  Big stars in other countries  And all that  Yeah  Aha supposedly  Never went away  They had gone away by now though  The lead singer  For A Flock of Seagulls  Just released a solo album  Really?  What's it called?  Zebrata  Is it good?  I mean  Do we have the song?  Are you asking me seriously?  Yeah  Okay  I don't know 
[03:19:30]  But I highly doubt it  Probably sounds like  They did reunite  Well  Their history is  79-86  Went away for three years  And it says  From 1989 to present  They're still a band  Wow  So they never really went away  Three years, huh?  Wow  Maybe things got too heavy  And the success was great  And they started to tape off  Full of 85 or whatever  Yeah  Just totally speculating  I think music started changing  A little bit  You think?  Yeah  85 
[03:20:00]  I think the jury's still out on that  Yeah  I think the jury's  The jury's still out from 85  You sure?  We're not positive  That the music has changed  It's a long sequestation  On 4 February 2013  Score indicated via his YouTube account  That he was pursuing his solo career  Wow  He released the singles  All I Want to Do in February 2013  And Somebody Like You in January 2014  Do we have somebody like you in the system?  I'm going to come in right now 
[03:20:30]  And take care of it  Get in here  Ooh  That sounds like something  I'm in a porno movie  I got a big bulge in my pants  So I'm going to come in there  And take care of it  Wow  Walks in with a shoe and kicks you  Why do we care?  Should we be moving on from this?  Maybe  We have somebody coming in from another room  To find a flock of seagulls  Lead singer solo  I was just curious if it was good  I know  Well it's not in there  I don't want to read the liner notes  Whatever happened to that guy  That did that song  In my car  Yeah, yeah  Didn't he become something? 
[03:21:00]  Like a fucking scientist or some shit  Gary Newman?  Gary Newman  Jesus  Is he a pilot?  I think he's  What?  He's something  Like I haven't thought of that song in 30 years  Trust me, it's not that impressive  Gary Newman is something  When you've played that song a hundred million times on the radio  What is Gary Newman doing now?  I don't know  He's still playing  No, he's something  No, he's  No, look  This is a photo of Gary Newman performing at Ben & Jerry's Double Scoop Sunday Festival  Three years ago, Anthony  Yeah, but I think he did something in between 
[03:21:30]  I don't think you ever want to play at the Ben & Jerry's Double Scoop Festival  He looks a little like Billy Joe from Green Day  He looks a little like John Stamos  Like John Stamos?  Could be worse, huh?  I think he was at the Nine Inch Nails concert that I was at like years ago  Is he a fucking experimental pilot or something?  Yeah, he was like  He's a pioneer of electronic music  No, now you're onto something  This guy?  Yeah  No, he  Experimental 
[03:22:00]  Yeah, he's like a test pilot or something  I think you're right  Come on  Find it, I think it's right  Personal life  Okay  Find it on a wiki  He's a positive atheist  Oh  Oh no  Come on  Well, you know, people get sick  We shouldn't mock that  Oh God  Yeah, Newman is known for his love of flying  A passion  Very good  Which has featured in some of his music videos  Some of his music  You mean his one music video that everyone saw  No  And then all the years 
[03:22:30]  And I Can't Stop  Like I said  One Hit Wonder  Gary Newman  Thank you  Let's hear Somebody Like You  From the Greatest Band of All Time  Well, actually the lead singer of the Greatest Band of All Time  What was that guy's name?  As a solo artist  Score  Right, Mike Score  Mike Score?  Somebody Like You  Is it real?  He likes that word you in his songs though  Yes  Somebody Like You  To meet somebody like you  That's an official video song  And I Jogged  Yes 
[03:23:00]  The original song was  I Meandered  And it just didn't have the same thing  I Meandered  Casually Away  Oh  That's him alright  He still looks futuristic  It looks alright  It's like the guy  He doesn't have the flock of seagulls hair do though  No  Which was called  The flock of seagulls  Oh my god  Who does he look like right there  Wait  He does look like 
[03:23:30]  He looks like Brando  I don't know  All I wanna do  Is get  Up the river  I don't  I don't know  It's not grabbing me  It's not bad though  It's not bad  His voice sounds good  Who the fuck does he look like  He's really bald with sunglasses  But his face is driving me  Bob Kelly  He does look like  Yeah a little bit  But he's too old  But Bob Kelly 
[03:24:00]  He does look like somebody  Maybe yes  It looks like  Steve Ben  Rod Steiger  Yes  There you go  Yes  Rod Steiger  Oh very good  Yeah  Virgil is a funny name  Poor nigga  What do they call you back home  They call me Mr. Tibbs  Virgil's funny name  I can have a shot for that  Yeah he looks like  Fucking Rod Steiger 
[03:24:30]  Yeah  Yeah  Yeah  Yeah  I don't think it's getting any better  It's like some mellow shit  You don't like this  I think this is alright  It's not bad  It's whatever  It's just there  If I was watching  It's forgettable  If I was listening to the 80's channel  And they spawned  I would listen to it  Is that new?  No  I mean yes  From 2014  I don't think the 80's channel  Plays like new songs  From 80's artists  No they gotta stick to the fucking  They're not brave enough  To do that  Program  It should be the new songs  Of the 80's  I wouldn't want to hear that  His voice sounded pretty good though right 
[03:25:00]  The second I tune in the 80's  I want to hear  Shit from the 80's  Yeah  Share  Well  Little Gypsies  Tramps and Thieves  On the 70's channel  70's  Sure they'll play that  Poor Mike Scoralance  Oh no  He only has 823 likes  On his Facebook page  But he was in the greatest  Rock band of all time  It's a new thing  He's getting with it  Leave him alone  His new song is very good  All I want to do  It's kind of catchy  It is  And his voice sounds good  For a guy who's probably  What's he called 
[03:25:30]  Is he 50?  60?  He's older than that  I'll just keep yelling numbers  For someone who confirms it  Well 32 years ago  For Iran  So  He's 57  That's good  Well said  Well he was born in 57  So I was doing the math  I'm just having fun  To humiliate me  So his popularity was done  Before he even turned 30  Basically  Oh that's gotta suck  Yeah  Oh look at him  With the flock of seagulls  That was called  The flock of seagulls  That's right  They thought it would last forever  Bunch of fucking bird brains 
[03:26:00]  Yo  Flock of seagulls  He was just the guy on the couch  Oh Jesus  The fuck  Yeah  Delightful  Yeah  That's  It's gonna be in the head  For a little while  Right  I take it  Let's take  This phone call  From Dave  In North Carolina  Dave  Yeah  Dave man  Hey man

[03:27:30]  Could you get to the point  I liked another man's  Little mustache too  Where is this going sir  Well so  You know I  I've been  I've been thinking about this  For a lot  A long time lately  And I just  I've been having these dreams  Of tickling you  Aw  Is this Richard  Shepansky  From fucking California  No he's gone 
[03:28:00]  Calling from the tree house  Oh that's right  He's gone  He's gone  This isn't going anywhere  Is there any way  Do you ever have  Thoughts like that  Anthony  No  He's a big dude  Bubba Ray  Alright  Alright are you done  Goodbye  Alright that didn't go anywhere  Sorry  Let's get Bubba Ray Dudley in here  He's a big fucking dude  Why are you angry  Yeah he got big  Wow he's fucking  Jacked this motherfucker  Holy shit

[03:29:00]  My arm is bigger than your body  Yeah you really are  A large man  Holy fuck  How are you guys doing  Thanks for having me on  Appreciate it  Long time no safe  It has been a while  The mic sucks  Yeah  Does it  Yeah  Well that's  You know  Well hold on  Let me turn yours off  Try it again  There you go  How's that better  No we're having  Horrible mic problems today  Best radio show in the world  And my mic sucks  That's always the fucking case  Our equipment stinks on ice  Try it again 
[03:29:30]  You can move over there  Alright yeah  Sorry about that  Are you guys ribbing me  You just want to  No no no  That's the mic that was Anthony's  That's  We would be guilty of doing that  You're right  But not this time  And my headphones don't work either  Oh really  Maybe the volume just isn't up  God damn  We would do something like this  There you go  But no we have a really shitty studio  For some reason they don't care  So whatever  It's all good  Yeah  You know Sammy Roberts right  Yeah  Yep  Yep  Sam's like the fucking 
[03:30:00]  Pride of WWE now  He's like their little mascot  Everyone knows him  I hate that he's like  All of his childhood heroes  Now know his name  Yeah  The only one that doesn't care about him  Is Vince who could hire him  Yeah  Exactly  Sam go get me a coffee  Come on boy  And you want to be called  Bubba Ray Dudley  Obviously  You can call me Bubba Ray  Bully Ray  I mean I'm Bully Ray now  In TNA  But you know that's cool  But you'll always be Bubba Ray  Yeah  Okay good  At least we got that out 
[03:30:30]  Sam  When people come up to you  On the street  What do they call you  No I'm getting bullied now  Because I've been bullied  For three years  And it's the persona  That I've adopted  Since I became a singles wrestler  So it's going really well  And people dig the bully name  So  But if Vince calls  And says Bubba  We need you back  That Bully Ray  Goes out the fucking  Out the window  Quickly  That's hilarious  That's why I like you  You're honest  Bubba this is Vince  No Vince  They call me bully now 
[03:31:00]  The hell they do  I need you at the garden  Exactly  I think  And you don't have to comment  About this obviously  But I think it's such bullshit  That Vince takes your names  After everything you did  For his organization  And it's happened  To a lot of you guys  It just doesn't seem fair  Here is the deal  Like when we left there  In 2005  He had bought ECW  At a bankruptcy court  And since the Dudley name  Was an original  Intellectual property 
[03:31:30]  Of ECW  Right  He was claiming  Ownership to the name  Right  But we had used it  For years before  We got to WWE  And Vince hired  The Dudley boys  Right  So it's one of those things  That we could have  Dragged it through court  It would have cost  About $100,000  And in the end  I'm glad they kept the name  Because we still make  A really great living  On our residuals  Right  And you know  We just reinvented  Ourselves as a team  With T&A  And you know  Right  Everyone knows it's you  I mean it's you  So you guys do make money  Off your old name  Oh absolutely  Four times a year  A very nice check  Comes in the mail  Courtesy of Vince McMahon 
[03:32:00]  I think this is the first  We're hearing of that  Alright so that's not as bad  Could you have bought  The intellectual property rights  For your name  Had you known  This was going to come  Or was that not available  No  Once you go there  You sign everything over  You basically give them everything  Your blood  Your first born  Yeah  You know  Wow yeah yeah yeah  I don't like that  When your boss is a billionaire  It seems a little  A bit greedy  No I know you have  Nothing bad to say  But I really don't  But from an outsider's point  It seems like  Well you gotta also look at  What they're giving you  You know 
[03:32:30]  Giving you the stage  You know  To make something of yourself  Make a star  Big superstar  It was an awesome time there  Awesome time  Yep  Why did you leave  Or what happened  There was just nothing  Left to do there  You know  Tag team wrestling  We were there for the  For the heyday  Of tag team wrestling  Hell yeah you were  And you know  There was just  No more teams to wrestle  Nothing left to do  And Vince just said  You know  When the time is right  We'll have you back  Wow  And you know  The time hasn't been right yet  You know tag team wrestling  Was kind of stale in WWE 
[03:33:00]  And they're trying to breathe life  Back into it  And you know  Maybe one day  You never say never  But  What happened  What happened  To tag team wrestling  Why wasn't it  As good anymore  But you just  You just didn't have  The quality of the teams  Of like the Dudleys  And the Hardys  And Edge and Christian  And things like that  How you doing  I'd like to play  Connected Dots  She sweats a lot  She's the one that was 
[03:33:30]  Sweating a lot  She does construction on her  She's very adorable though  You're adorable  You're cute  Dare I say hot  Whoa  Lovely girl  But sweats a lot  Anyway  You're so fine  Bring it out  How many years ago  Was that that you left  That was 2005  It's already been  Nine years  Yeah  Yeah 2005  Yep  Maybe 2006  I don't know  Huh  Okay  But things have been  Great since then  I got no complaints  Everything's  You know  Listen  Where's home base 
[03:34:00]  Florida now  Florida  Yeah  You blew off  Long Island  Vacationing by the way  Right  Why not Long Island  Because just the weather  Up here sucks  What the fuck's  The matter with you  You're fucking  Leaving Long Island  I split  I was going to  Move back up here  This year  But after the winter  You guys just had  Screw that  You want beaches  And shit  What's wrong with  Ron Conkoma  Ron Conkoma  Tremendous 
[03:34:30]  What part of Florida  Lake Mary  It's like 20 minutes  North of Orlando  Oh that's a nice area  It's a nice quiet area  Not a lot of people  Right  You know  A lot of wrestlers  Are down there  In Florida  Yeah I know  In Florida  None of the undesirables  Live there  So you know  That's how you can tell  He's from Long Island  I love it  I love it  Why is Tampa  So big for  X-Wrestling  Well the Hulk's  From there  The Blue Meanie  I think  Blue Meanie  I don't know  You just pull the 
[03:35:00]  Blue Meanie's name  Out of your ass  I think he's from there  Right Sam  Yeah the Blue Meanie's  From there  Who else  Is that where the Hulk's  House was  That he couldn't go to  When he was on his boat  It's one of our favorites  Yep  Hulk does live there  I almost made it to that  House by the way  Almost made it to that  Yeah  And then  Well  Well  You'd have been  Trespassing too  He  Well no  There was a little time  There where  Me and his  Lovely daughter  Were recording  An item  Yes  Holy fuckeroni 
[03:35:30]  Yeah I almost made it  To the house  Did you get it in  Oh Jesus  What that's how the kids  That's what she said  I just say that  Like I just say that  Like a whole  Oh but that's how  To make it sound like  I want to know too  I want to talk like the kids  She's really sexy  Get it in  She's fantastic  Brooke is beautiful  Beautiful  I mean that's a  That's a legit six footer  And her bare feet  And she's put together  Like a brick shithouse  The problem is  She's beautiful  For guys like you  Cause you're a big  Huge fucking  In shape guy  For guys like us  She looks like a monster  I think she's hot  I think she looks like 
[03:36:00]  A monster with a pretty face  I love her  She's totally proportionate  She's totally proportionate  Does she have nice feet  Yeah she does  I've recently kind of  Gotten at the feet  I'm like she's a big girl  She probably has nice  Big sexy well shaped feet  I guess those big ones  That look like talons  A lot of ligaments  She took great care of herself  Beautiful girl  Had a lot of fun  How long did you do  Damn you  Wow  About two months  Oh okay  That's all it takes  I decided to go back  Get back together 
[03:36:30]  With my ex-girlfriend  Who's now my ex-girlfriend again  You blew the Hogan fortune  On ex  Yes I did  Jimmy you got ten seconds  Let me have it  How long did you last  Let me have it  Call me every name  In the book  Well how long did you  Last your ex  When you went back  A year  Wow  But why did you  Leave the first time  Or why did you  Break up the first time  It's just one of those  Things where you know  One month on  One month off  You know  Couldn't handle the lifestyle  Ron Valeri gave me  The best advice ever 
[03:37:00]  He says if you're  Thinking of going back  To your ex  Don't  It was as simple as that  It can never work  It was as simple as that  He goes when you start  Thinking wait  Maybe you can work  This time around  Here's a funny story  You guys will like  So I had seen  You know  Brooke had come to  A bunch of the shows  And she was actually  Involved in my storyline  With Hulk  And so Brooke would  Always come up to me  And she'd always be  Talking to me  And then we exchanged  Numbers  We'd text  And you know  She'd always be like  Do you like me  Do you like me  Do you like me  I mean some real  Third grade shit 
[03:37:30]  You know  I thought she was  Going to hand me  One of those origami  Things  You know  B-L-R-U-E  So we started talking  And we started hanging out  A little bit  And Hulk says  I'd like to talk to you  And my Hulk voice  Is kind of like  My Vince voice  He goes  I want to talk to you  He goes  I'd like to talk to you  About my daughter  And I said  Hulk  Before you go any farther  You don't have to say  Another word  You don't have to worry  I'm ultra respectful  I would never  Do anything  You know  Bad to your daughter 
[03:38:00]  Or anything like that  He goes  No you don't understand  I'm warning you  About my daughter  Oh wow  No kidding  I swear  It was surreal  Here's Hulk Hogan  Telling me  My daughter has eyes  For you  You better be careful  Because what Brooke wants  Brooke gets  Oh shit  Yeah  Wow  So that was  Pretty crazy  And how and why  Did that end  Yeah  Like I said  I don't know  I went back with my ex  I could have been  The heir to the 
[03:38:30]  Hogan fortune  After a couple of months  Though with a girl  Even if you're ex  You want to go back  It's still pretty new  Were things fading  With like  Kind of after two months  Were you like  Yeah this is probably  The other future  He's being polite  I know exactly what happened  Tell me  She's a bit  She's a bit of a bimbo  And after the hotness wore off  You're like  Oh boy  I have nothing  I have nothing  I'm going to be honest  With you guys  Listen you guys  Are giving me some  Prime real estate here  I'd be honest with you  If she was a bimbo  If she didn't have brains 
[03:39:00]  I would say  Demanding  No she was cool as hell  But she was cool as hell  She's bald and wears a bandana  No  And other than the five inches  She was packing  There was nothing wrong  Exactly  Who would settle for that  On a tall girl  That's embarrassingly smart  I know what happened  What  She started bench pressing  More than you  And got bothered you  So you had to say  I gotta go  No just one of those things  Just one of those things  She is super  If she was in here  And like her long  She has like long  Like well shaped legs  She's very sexy  But she's really 
[03:39:30]  I mean she's huge  Not in a slobby  No for you  But that's cool  That's the same  Like playing on a big toy  You know  I would look ridiculous  Like a bouncy house  With her  Yeah  Fucking great  I would love to date  Someone like her  And have her just  Dominate me  And put her fingers  In my mouth  Whether I liked it  Or not  Wow  Yeah  I could see that  Jimmy  That would be awesome  She'll get a fish hook  Yeah  So then you get back  To together with the ex  And then it goes bad  Again  Well just because  Of my schedule  And my lifestyle  And just  She led a very 
[03:40:00]  9 to 5 life  And you're on the road  All the time  I mean I've been  On the road for 20 years  I've been living  Out of a suitcase  For 20 years  I mean with WWE  I was on the road  300 days a year  300  300 days a year  For 6 years  Wow  Crazy  Because back then  I mean you guys  Remember that was when  I mean we were rock stars  That's when you know  The attitude era  And things were just  Off the charts  Crazy  Now with TNA  I'm on the road  About 150 days a year  With them  And then probably  Another 50 days a year  Doing outside stuff 
[03:40:30]  Like going back and forth  To Japan  And wrestling there  So I'm still totally  That's a lot of time still  200 days a year  Yep  Wow  Different planes  Different hotel rooms  Different cars  Different chicks  You know  It gets rough  How do you  200 days  That's a little less  Than 30 weeks a year  You can't be squeezed  In a fucking coach  When you fly  Right  No thank god  I'm not a coach  Yeah  That's crazy  Yeah  Big gay  You like being on the road  That much  I do  I do  I mean I knew  I was signing up for  When I wanted to be a pro  I wanted to be three things 
[03:41:00]  When I was a kid  I wanted to be a pro wrestler  I wanted to be a rock star  And I wanted to be in porn  So so far I've done  Two out of three  There you go  And since Meatloaf  Cornered the market  On the 300 pound front man  I'm shit out of luck  With that one  Meatloaf  He's a strange bird  He is a strange bird  We've had him in a couple  We like him though  He's a good  Because this will get back to him again  Yeah yeah  Because he said he was looking up  YouTube videos or something  He won't watch himself  He's strange but  No he's  He's entertaining as all 
[03:41:30]  Yeah yeah  He's a fun guest  Right  Yeah  So what are you doing now  Are you in a relationship  No  Yes I actually  I am in a relationship  You just said no  Are you crazy  No I had to  I thought you were going to ask me  A different question  But yes I am  I am involved with somebody  Yes  Is that going well  It's going awesome  That's good  Yeah  Bruno San Martino's daughter  Who's daughter  Is it  Who's daughter  No  It's somebody's daughter  Right  Somebody's daughter  Yeah  I haven't met that somebody 
[03:42:00]  Though yet  But how's that going to work  If you're still on the road a lot  Well she's on the road also  Ah  Oh  Are we going to get a scoop today  Are you dating a wrestler  I am  I am currently involved  With a young lady  In the wrestling business  Do you know  I do not  Wow  Sam Roberts doesn't know  Would we know  Sam will definitely know  You guys might know  Because I know you guys  Are not like on the wrestling  Is it a diva  On the wrestling bandwagon  Moolah  Moolah  Moolah is dead Jimmy  That doesn't mean you can't be 
[03:42:30]  With her daughter  Is it a diva  She's one of the TNA knockouts  Oh right  A knockout  Yeah  So go ahead Sam  You get one shot at this  I don't know who it is  Stop looking sexy against the wall  Like you're James Dean  With your fucking denim shoes  Those are vans  Ah they're awful  Sam wears vans  I wish Susan Smith was driving it  What you're looking up  TNA knockouts  Who is it  Alright let's see 
[03:43:00]  Sam's coming over to  Bully Ray  No not that one  She was an on screen  That was one of the girls  I had on screen  She was my last  On  You know  On screen  I said on screen  Three times  No it's not Brooke  It's the lovely  Miss Velvet Sky  Alright  Okay  Is that her real name  She came bobsledding  Out of a mother's uterus  And she said  Oh look Velvet  Let me see what she looks like 
[03:43:30]  Sam  She's a tomato  Alright  Let's see  I am much higher than Brooke  That's an upgrade right  Of course it is  Normal size girl  Christ  What  Wow  What do you guys think  That's a pretty nice  Wow  That's good  Because you're both on the road together  You gotta be his size  To handle a girl like this  Because every guy  Is gonna want to hook up with her  Yeah you gotta know  How to beat some people up  You have to be his size  To be able to go out with her  Because there's gonna be problems  Right  And you know  She wants a guy like 
[03:44:00]  Who could probably like  Keep other guys away from her  She is more of a man  Than any man  In this room right now  Let's not say much  I always tell her  She's one chromosome away  From eight inches  She's a dude  She's an obese man  Trapped in a really hot girl's body  Damn  Wow  She poses really nice  Congrats  That's pretty fucking nice  But the outfit's too flimsy  You can see  She should cover up a little bit  I totally agree  Before you bring her home to mom  Wow 
[03:44:30]  Yeah that's cool  She's great  When you're on the road  Do you go cheap  Or do you take care of yourself  No  Because  You know  McFoley's been in here  And he tells his stories  Skin Flint  They're the best  His cheap stories  He's still renting a Scirocco  Scirocco  Wow  That's a Long Island car too  Yeah yeah  Maybe it's a car for everyone  Scirocco  That was a big one  On Long Island  We're growing up  Wow yeah  Mick's an awesome guy  But yes  I would love him  He'll stay in a red roof  Every single day  He was telling us  He would sleep on couches 
[03:45:00]  Of fans  Absolutely  When he was like  Massively  When he was the champion  There you go  Him and Austin  Used to have contests  Both when they were making  A gazillion dollars a year  Who could rent  The cheapest rental car  And Mick was notorious  For wearing the same pair  Of underwear  For three four days straight  Oh wow  Why that  I don't know  Damn  I have no idea  Oh fucking  Get more  I'm there  I'm there  I'm there  I'm there  I'm there  I'm there  I'm there  Mick Foley's underwear  Probably don't smell good 
[03:45:30]  Three minutes after  He puts them on  He looks like  That's how we got  Five, three days  Yeah  Wow man  Wow  That's right  And what are you doing  For fun  Besides velvet  You know  Your down time  What do you like to do  I try to catch  As many rock and roll  Shows as possible  What bands  I need to  Old school  ACDC  Kiss  Motley Crue  The whole nine yards  So you know  Looking forward to  Jimmy  I'm digging your show  Oh thanks  That you have  On Ozzy's Bullion 
[03:46:00]  Yep  Thank you  It's all good  Keith Roth has got a good show on there too  And a bunch of those guys  See this is a great cross promotion of the platform  I know  Are you allowed to do that or not?  Yeah  Yeah  Florentine show  I know Florentine  Like for over 20 years  Like he wrote a book  Back in the day  Like how to  How to score with chicks  I remember that  He autographed it to me  I still have my autographed copy  Of Florentine's book  Holy shit  That's hilarious  No kidding  Yeah  I remember Jim  When he did a book on tape for that 
[03:46:30]  How to score with chicks  Yeah  How to score with chicks  And then like page five  You know  Get a cheek peak  You know  It was all this fucking  Funny Jim shit  Yeah  I gotta read that  It's definitely a funny book  Timeless  How's TNA treating you?  TNA's treating me great  Are the ratings good?  Are you getting fans out?  Like where are we at with this?  We'd love to be moving forward a little bit quicker  But you know  We do the same rating every week  We get about 1.5 to 2 million viewers  It's a great product  That's nice  We just need to get the name out there a little bit more 
[03:47:00]  Right  And on June 25th, 26th, and 27th  We're gonna be here in New York City for the first time  Doing television  Oh shit  At the Manhattan Center  So it's a pretty big deal for us  Maybe we go  We should go  We should go maybe  I would love for you guys to come  I mean you guys supported me back when I was in WWE  I know wrestling's not right up your alley these days  But  I mean the era from when we were at NW  That was just  That was crazy  I don't know if they'll ever get back to that point  TNA's definitely looking to move into a little bit of a mature 
[03:47:30]  Adult oriented  A little edgier  Yes  Definitely want to get a little edgier  So  Who are some of the guys that are over at TNA with you that we would know  Did you know Jeff Hardy  Sure  Kurt Angle  Sure  How's Kurt  Kurt's doing good  Is he doing good  He really is  Is he doing  No  He's really doing well  He's much better  He scared us a little bit  I don't know what's going on with him  I have no fucking idea  But he seemed a little different from the NW days when he used to come in  No  He's doing alright  He's really doing well  Good  And we've had a bunch of guys that you would know who've come in and out of there 
[03:48:00]  Obviously Hulk was there  And Sting was there  And Steiner was there  And Booker T was there  Right  But they treat me great  I enjoy being there  And I just like you know  Being in a smaller company right now  Where I can do what  You know  I do what they got to do  And I do what I want to do  How often are you in the gym  About five days a week  Five days a week  Yep  I got up this morning at about five o'clock  Popped to Adderall  Benched about $4.95  Came here to talk to you wonderful gentlemen  Do you really benched $4.95? 
[03:48:30]  Yeah  For reps  For reps  For reps  Jesus Christ  How many reps?  About two  How much cardio do you do?  I get very tuckered out very quickly  Very tuckered  Tuckered out  You're really pushing $4.95  Yeah  Wow  Speaking of $4.95  Long Island  The good old $4.95  One of the most miserable stretches  Other than the $4.05 in LA  Probably one of the most miserable stretches 
[03:49:00]  I think $4.95 is worse  $4.05 is a hunk of shit man  I believe that  It's the worst  It's the only reason why I live in the city  I gave up on Long Island  Because of that fucking $4.95  Period  I couldn't handle it anymore  At least on the $4.95  You can kind of judge  Like there's an hour here  An hour there  Where you know  You may be able to  Get through  Get through  The $4.05 in LA  It's constantly just packed with people  It's horrible  And it's annoying  Because there's so many lanes  It's like you have 37 lanes  How does this not move at all? 
[03:49:30]  That's a bad road  So I got to do about five days of cardio  Jimmy?  No public transportation  I mean I was a lot  Last time I saw you guys  I looked different  I was heavier  I just decided  Were you heavier?  You were heavier  But not muscle heavy  I wasn't  You're cut  Yeah  So I was probably  I don't know  About 325 then  Now I'm 275  Ripped, chiseled, and jacked  Wow  The bench barbell plates  Eat Tebow's and steaks  You know  The old stupid star Billy Graham shit  Steroids?  No  Jesus  No  What?  That's a good question 
[03:50:00]  Getting right to the fucking bottom of it  I did it all clean  Yeah  Even back in the day  When they all were doing it  I didn't look like that  Back in the day  I didn't look like  You were softer  That's true, yeah  I did  You're softer than you are now  You just said that  Jimmy, he called me softer  I didn't care for that either  But I wasn't going to mention it  You said it  You were like  You know  You were kind of  Pillsbury dope  You were like  150 pounds  Two-bottle gun  I gotta tell you  Just something really funny  Quick  Last night  You know  I put on Twitter 
[03:50:30]  That I was going to be here  Because I really appreciate  You guys having me  And a bunch of your fans  Were begging me  Begging me  Begging me  Not to tell  Oh, I don't care  Honestly, I don't care  Not to tell the infamous story  So I don't  I don't want to piss off  Any of your listeners  No, we told it over the years  I started to think to myself  Who else was in that limo that day?  That was my  That was my girlfriend  At the time  Who I was with for like 10 years  And then went back to after Hulk?  No, no, no  After Hulk  After Hulk  Jesus  After me and Hulk dated  For two months  No, the story is simple 
[03:51:00]  You came in to AEW  And I was ready to get on the train  And you're like  Dude, I'll drive you  I got the limo  Why did you have a limo that day?  Because we were doing a media tour  And your show was part of it  And they picked me up in Long Island  Nice  WWE, you know, back in the day  It was, you know, limousine  Riding, jet flying  Money to be spent  Yes  And I was loving it  But I was sitting on the side  Which is the worst place to be in a limo  You're a little sick in the limo  And we were having a good time  And I was really digging, talking to you and stuff 
[03:51:30]  And then I'm like, oh man  I might fucking puke  This is going to be best  It's the worst  Damn  It's the worst  And then soon as we pulled over on the service road  I was fucking puking  And there's Bubba just fucking pointing and laughing  Oh, you actually got out and puked and got back in?  No, I was done  I made it to my stop  But as soon as I got out  I had someone picking me up  I got exit  Oh, yeah, almost  You couldn't fucking like  Because why drive me all the way home, right, Bubba?  Yeah  You're the one who said you could drop me off right here on the service road  On the service road  Yeah, we'll slow the car down  Yeah  I actually made a roll 
[03:52:00]  And you weren't that big of a star then  So the service road is fine  I had to make calls  Like, meet me on the service road  I think it was Deer Park Avenue  If I remember correctly  Probably, yeah  And as soon as I got out  I'm fucking just hurling  And he's just laughing, pointing and laughing  It takes off in mid-puke  You almost made it without him seeing?  No, I saw every bit of it  Hurt every bit of it  I was hurt  Every chunk that came out of his guts  Was on the side of the LA  Damn  I was hurting, man  So  Shit  I've been instructed to ask you 
[03:52:30]  About a promo I saw on EC3  What was his name?  I don't remember the name  What?  I vaguely remember the promo  What?  Do you remember?  I don't know  Sam, mic's not  Yeah, go ahead  You good?  You don't sound right  It doesn't matter  It never sounds good  Do you remember when we played the TNA promo  That Jim saw watching Impact?  Oh, no  And we spent like 20 minutes on it  Really?  I swear to you  They watched one of EC3's promos on the air  Oh  And Jim took it apart  Oh, shit, really? 
[03:53:00]  It's by piece, yeah  It wasn't exactly cinematic excellence, Jimmy  Oh, that was  I remember now  Yeah, I don't remember  He was horrible  Do you know EC3?  I just wrestled him the other night  In a Texas death match  Sorry  That's okay  I only vaguely  Oh, EC3's a guy?  Oh, I don't remember  I thought that was the name of the league  Baba, his mic skills were not as good as yours  I'll just say that much  You're very good on the mic  And he  I mean, this was a few years ago  So he probably  Look, I'm trying to spin this  He probably is better  What did it sound like?  It was a few days ago 
[03:53:30]  Do we have any of it?  Play a second of it  I vaguely remember the incident  But I don't remember  I gotta make we  He's a good up-and-coming wrestler  I gotta make we  Are you gonna  Alright, well, we can take a break  Yes, we can come back  Why don't we take a break?

Supposedly  That's what I heard  It doesn't match up  They don't give a fuck  They don't give a fuck  Actually this is the best  Treatment you can get  Because the other shows  They'll actually walk by  And throw piss bags  At them while they're on the air  We get the  We're on the non-colostomy  Treatment list  Which is actually pretty good  I've got to ask you guys  One question  Yes  What's with all the hatred  For the World Cup?  It's not hatred  It's misunderstanding  It's indifference  Indifference 
[04:02:30]  That's a good word  Explain it  I love it  It's my favorite sport  Wow  Soccer is your favorite  I love soccer  It's my favorite sport  Why?  Because of the passion of the game  There is no more passionate sport  And there's no more passionate fans  Than soccer fans  Now soccer fans in the United States  Are good  But when you see soccer  Like in Europe  Like the English Premier League  Or the Italian League  You're talking about  A different level  Stuff over there  Makes Yankees Red Sox  Look like sandbox play  Right  That's how into it  The people are  So I just love  The passion of the game  Well that used to be wars 
[04:03:00]  Back in the day  Yeah exactly  Just go and conquer each other  That's right  That's why they have that  Because they remember  Hey you killed my grandfather  It's true  Like the two teams over there  Celtic and Rangers  Basically it's the Protestants  Versus the Catholics  Oh wow  And when they get together  It's a whooping good time  Some hooligans in the crowd  Yes  They mean business  Yes  I don't know  We were talking about it  Like when you get  Three shots on goal  The whole game  You're kind of like  Ah  It's a lot of guys running 
[04:03:30]  Do you actually watch  Entire matches  The entire game  It's only an hour and a half game  No I know that  It's a short game  I know it feels like  An eternity  Sometimes with a lot of scoring  But yesterday  Brazil and Mexico  That's the most exciting  0-0 game you'll see  Wow really  But do you feel a little empty  Although Mexico  That's a big deal  Watching a game like that  Is kind of like  Having tantric sex  You don't necessarily  Have to come  Jimmy cue the one lighter  And you don't have to 
[04:04:00]  Pretend you like  Sting's music  I don't  Tantric sex sounds good  But I've never really done it  But I've never quite a while  Because you want to come  Exactly  Oh my god  Who has that patience  To me I'm just so greedy  Jim you're going to feel  Like Tweedle Tweedle  On the nips  Done  What's the next thing  We're supposed to listen  To a talk  How'd you get a soccer  On Long Island  You played it as a kid 
[04:04:30]  I never played it as a kid  I just always appreciated  The game  I enjoyed playing it  Like recreationally  And then when soccer  Finally made its way  Over here to the United States  We could see the European leagues  Just loved watching it  Always into it  So you're watching  Even if it's not the World Cup  Religiously  Wow  I follow the English Premier League  And the Italian League  Every year  Just like I would follow  Major League Baseball  Or the NFL  What are the commercials like  Because someone said  They never got a tremendous  Amount of play here  Because it's hard to do commercials  Well that's why soccer  Will never take off 
[04:05:00]  In the United States  Because you can't do commercials  It's 45 minutes  Of unstopped play  So you can't  You only have 15 minutes  At halftime  To really shill your  You know your product  So it's all stuff  Like advertising on the wall  Like behind home plate  Okay  Yep  Shit  That's just not enough  To keep it going  I guess  Well can't they put up  Like CNN graphics  Or something  But sponsors  You know what I mean  Now they can probably  Right  And plus like  If you take a look  At sports in the United States  They've watered down sports  So much  So there's more scoring  Because you know  Here we need  We need that 
[04:05:30]  People love scoring  Exactly  Exactly  Europe has a different mentality  And I just appreciate  The game a lot  Fair enough  I wish I liked it  It's such a fucking  Massive sport  But  I watched USA versus Ghana  It was you know  I was into it a little bit  For a while  But  And then  I don't know  A lot of hot chicks  At the World Cup  Tons of them  Yeah  Brazilian chicks  Italian chicks  Mexican chicks  Yeah  Yep  I saw those  I said it yesterday  A lot of those  Girls for some of these teams 
[04:06:00]  They just all look like  Jesse Orozco  They all fucking have that  Jesse Orozco face  Oh my god  Wow  You've traveled the world  Where are the hottest chicks?  Uh  Scandinavia  Like Finland  Sweden  Oh yeah  They're all  Brooke Hogan look  Big  Every girl looks like  Brooke Hogan  Are the ugly ones  Really hot  As far as  American standards go  They're all gorgeous 
[04:06:30]  Wow  Vikings  Great skin  Beautiful blonde hair  Blue eyes  Oh nice  And very scantily clad  Nice  Wow  Nice people  Or do they have the attitudes  No  You know where you get the attitudes  In France  Everyone says that  France is the shit  What's wrong with them  They're miserable  And even more miserable  Than the actual French  In France  Are French Canadians  In Montreal  Right  They hate everybody  We ran into a couple of them 
[04:07:00]  Right  Yeah  Montreal  I loved Montreal  Montreal was fun  It's a great city to party in  But I mean I've been  It's one of my least  Favorite places  To perform  I just  Never  Why  I just don't  I'm not a fan of the people  They're very rude  They make New Yorkers  Look like you know  Quakers  Our fans up there  When we broadcast live last year  At the comedy festival  They're really polite  And we're like  Man maybe this isn't working today  But then they would  They would  You know 
[04:07:30]  Laugh pretty hard  When  Yeah yeah  When it was time I guess  I don't know  I'm pretty easy to hate  So whatever  What about Japan  Japan is my absolute favorite place  In the world to perform  I don't want to go there badly  It's awesome  You like the culture and all that  Love the culture  And pro wrestlers in Japan  Are treated like absolute gods  Really  Yeah  Yeah  But you feel like a god too  Because you're so much bigger  Oh you must stand out  Walking down the street  Me and my partner D-Von  Like  I'm not trying to sound like  A big shot here or anything  But like we can't  It's hard to walk the streets 
[04:08:00]  No shit  They all know you there right  Yeah  I mean we've been going there  For over 15 years  We've never lost a match in Japan  We're pretty decorated over there  As far as being champion  So you know  They see us on the streets  And they just mob us  Wow  It's cool  You ever go with a Japanese girl?  Yeah  I've never done that  It's a lot of fun  They knock  Here's my favorite story  I got in my hotel room one time  And I get a knock at the door  I look  I open the door  And I hear  Yes  Mr. Bubba Ray  Maybe I come inside 
[04:08:30]  And we have conversation  I said sure  Come on inside  We can talk about  Whatever you'd like to talk about  Whoa  Yeah  Wow  They know their role  Damn  Japanese groupies know their role  That's nice  Wow  Was she pretty?  Very pretty  But over there  Sometimes their teeth are  You know  They don't have a lot of  They haven't had a whole lot  Oh wait  Their bad teeth?  Yeah  Oh I never noticed 
[04:09:00]  Is that from the sushi?  I don't know what it's from  I think there's some  Fucking you know  Genetic thing going on  Really?  You could say that  Do you mean dirty teeth  Or just crooked?  Crooked  Oh  Crooked  Maybe the water  It could happen  Maybe they don't have fluoride  Let me tell you something  A lot of people  With political correctness and shit  A lot of people don't want to talk about it  But there are definitely genetic things  As far as skull shape  And things like that  That you could trace back  To certain  You know  People on the globe  Yeah  He's not like  They can tell if you were black or white 
[04:09:30]  By your skeleton I think  Yeah  It's not crazy  Exactly  And you know  Sometimes  Sometimes history  Jimmy the Greek  Talked about the extra  Jimmy the Greek talked about that  And he did very well  No he didn't  Oh boy  What did they toss his ass right now  Wow  Quickly too  He was like the first one  To lose his gig  Over some PC thing I think  But Howard Cosell also  He didn't lose his gig  He didn't lose his gig  For that one  Yeah  And he never said  Look at that little monkey run  What did he say 
[04:10:00]  He said something like  He said monkey  He's running like a monkey  Or something  It wasn't look at that little monkey run  It was like  He took off like a monkey  Or something  But  And nowadays  That would just get you  Fucking  A firing squad  Never mind  Fired  But  How about  But wait  You know  Just  Did you guys see  The Don Rickles roast  No  I  I  I still haven't seen it  They got away  With some stuff  On that show  That I was shocked  Like  Yeah  You know  It was on Spike TV  And you know  It was probably 
[04:10:30]  The edgiest  I've seen them get  With like  You know  Some black humor  And so  You know  Don Rickles was known  For that for years  But it wasn't him  Doing the shtick  It was everybody else  Doing  You know  Doing it  Editing  Editing a Rickles roast  You'd look so bad  Like this is the guy  You're gonna honor  But you're gonna edit  All this shit  You know  Uh huh  Even though  They probably would do that  The only  I mean  They let  They let everybody  Kind of say  And do whatever they want  I mean  They edited the F-bombs  But everything else  They left in  And I was shocked  Uh huh  Yeah  I think because it was Rickles  Probably  Yeah  That's probably why  And it was on Spike 
[04:11:00]  Which is an edgiest  Edgiest station  And it was on from like  9 to 11  So  It was a cool show though  They call that  Watershed  The Watershed  Time  Get a new rule book  Get a new rule book  Guilty  Guilty  Guilty  What else about Japan  I'm obsessed with Japan  Japan  It's just great  People are weirdos  Right  With their sexuality though  Sex is definitely weird  They're  They're into some weird stuff  Over there  Like you know  Puking on each other  And licking each other's eyeballs 
[04:11:30]  And you know  You can  You can go to a  Vending machine  In Japan  And buy  Like teenage girls  Underwear  Ooh  Not that I ever  Put five dollars in  I think you gotta do it  Just to  How do you know  But I don't  That wouldn't be  How do you know  It's authentic  A clean panty  I don't want some  Clean underpip fucking shorts  Are they dirty or clean  Supposedly they're used  I don't know  I think you gotta do it  Just to see  I guess  You know  You're a tourist  And all  But I don't  It's not necessarily 
[04:12:00]  My thing  I need to smell  Fucking girls  Why do you want  To go to Japan  I don't know  Because it's so different  A hand can be used  Like a knife  Right  And it's expensive too  It is  Just such a different culture  I've been performing  There for years  And it's great  They take great care  Of you  The culture's great  I love the food  Did you read  That sushi place  That Jiro guy  Is that his name  Jiro  Jiro  Jiro  What was the name  Jiro Dreams of Sushi  The documentary was boring  But I mean 
[04:12:30]  He's  Tiny little place  I think  Right outside a subway  Or something  No  You like sushi though  Love it  Do you get the weird stuff  Over there  The blowfish  I've had it  I've had it  Liked it  The only thing  I really don't like  Is the  What's it called  That mushy  Sea urchin  Sea urchin  I actually like that  Do you really  I do  It feels like a load  In the back of your throat  I don't eat it  I just throw it  On my face and back  No  If it smells like 
[04:13:00]  The ocean though  Fucking don't eat it  Because I think you can really tell  If that stuff's bad  Like if you smell it  It smells  Pussy  Yeah exactly  Sea urchin  Definitely is rank  I love it though  If it's well done  I didn't like it  Until I ate it at Yasuda  The guy finally said  You've got to try it  Because I said the exact same stuff  I'm like  That's the only thing I don't like  And he  I guess they get better stuff  Down there  Now wait a minute  Jimmy you just said  If it's good  If it's well done  So you've had it cooked  Oh no  I mean well done  Like well prepared  Well prepared  Fresh  But if it smells like  A little bit fishy  It's like I won't touch 
[04:13:30]  Any of that stuff  Sushi's pretty easy  To tell if it's bad  I think if you smell it  Go to Yasuda  Good  It's amazing  Anthony Bourdain  Turned me on to it  And I'm obsessed  With that place too  Cool  We try to go like  Once a month  Once every two months  Yasuda  Amazing  I'll tell them you sent me  Yeah  They don't know  They don't know  They don't know  Give me a free hot towel  They don't know  Or care who I am  In that place  Maybe I'll take  A nice young lady  To Yasuda  That's what I need to do  Find a nice young lady  Go sushi bar  Tables  Not as good  Why?  No  No because they  I mean 
[04:14:00]  It's so much fresher  Like you're getting  These pieces  One at a time  Kind of like  The place in LA  Well it's only  By a couple minutes  No  It's different  Bring a nice young lady there  Plus you have to order  At the table  And the guy behind  The sushi bar  He's looking at you  And he's suggesting  Things and stuff  It's nice  Nice experience  I'll tell the guy  I don't care  Let's go  Call me by name  Well there you go  Who's that young lady  In that picture right there  And  Disgraced Miss Colorado  Who's now doing porn  Oh fuck  She's hot  Yeah there you go  What is this? 
[04:14:30]  A disgraced  Former Miss Colorado  Teen contestant  Reportedly making porn  Well we need to find out  If this reportedly  Is true or not  I hope it is  I hear it  Oh it's true  They just are scared to  There's her  And then there's  The Delaware girl  Teen girl  She did one  But I think she's  Not doing anymore  Oh nerds  I follow her on  I follow her on the Twitter  And she seems to  Yeah you know  What was the one broad  That didn't know the  What the capital of  What was the  It was on the Todd show  Yeah  Oh 
[04:15:00]  The Todd show  Listening to that  My name was  Pretty Miss Girl boobs  He got a viral video  Because they asked her  What was the capital  No way  Man she didn't know  She didn't know  And she won from there  He had a viral video recently  Good for him  Two days ago  Oh that guy's good  Sorry I'm eating  Alright so listen  I'm saving you guys seats  In the front row of my show  You coming  We're going  You gotta come  I'm not doing front row  What do you mean  What  We don't do front row  Okay 
[04:15:30]  Tenth row  Yeah  We don't do front row  Nice  In the shadows  I like being in the shadows  I'm not going to put you on TV  No we  We were supposed to be in coffins  The coffins seats  In Worcester  For AEW  Scorch  Scorch  For WWE  And what happened  We didn't want to be in the coffins  Why not  Because he looked like a jackass  Yeah  But with this guy Scorch  Who also worked at the radio station  I'll take him  When we told him we didn't want to be in the coffins  He was all about it  He was very excited 
[04:16:00]  What if  What if  What if  What if  We bring you in the ring  And we let you hit somebody over the head with a chair  Nah  I would look like a goofball  Wasn't it an Undertaker match  I think so  Yeah  The Undertaker was doing something  And they wanted us to lay in the coffins  I'm like  Get the fuck out of here  Would you do that Sam  You would do that  Of course he would  I would do it  I'd lay in a coffin  Just to be silly  But for the whole like taping  You're in the coffin  We'd have to tinkle  We ended up way in the back  We were standing up just watching  And to look at Scorch in the coffin  We just kept laughing  He was so happy 
[04:16:30]  So that guy should never hate us  So you don't have any  Pro wrestling fantasy that you want to live out  God no  You're so past that  You're even making the bitter beer face  I'll tell you why  Because you gotta look the part  I obviously don't look the part  When radio guys and stuff do that  They look like fucking goofballs  You could be like David Arquette  He looked like a goofball  Prime example right there  I'm not trying to say I'm too cool for that shit  No it's more like you just look like an asshole 
[04:17:00]  There's no way to look cool  Unless you're a bigger guy  Take a hit the right way  Or make it look good  Selling the whole fucking move  You look like an idiot  No I wouldn't do that  Sam would in a second  We'll put you in the balcony  I'd love to see you use a chair on somebody  They hit you so hard your denim shoes fall off  Those denim shoes are fucking enraging  I really think I'm going to go next week  I hope you guys come  That would be fun man  Get a seat in the balcony or something 
[04:17:30]  It's a different wrestling experience  You're not going all out crazy  Like explosions and stuff are you  Like pyro and stuff  Yeah  No  What league is starting that up  What  I was just reading about the other day  Where they're going ridiculously extreme  Like crazy extreme  Is that guy's promo bad  Oh you want to play that  I don't remember  But he might like the guy  I'm sure he does  He's probably a great guy  Who  Ethan  He's a piece of shit 
[04:18:00]  I don't like him at all  He's a piece of shit  Yeah  You could  You could bury him all you want  I don't care  Sam  I'll hit play Sam  I have faced a litany of competition  Oh did we bash this guy  I have faced international talent  And I have faced legends  Come on 
[04:18:30]  This guy's awful already  But there is one man  There is one man who's been in the ring with  The likes of Andre the Giant  There's a man who's been in the ring  With the likes of Hulk Hogan  Oh boy  Look at his dumb face  I wish you people could see his face  Because he looks retarded  Jim you're a public speaker I would say right  Yes I am  What happens when you take breaks in your speech 
[04:19:00]  That are applause breaks  And it's just a stagnant noise  That's only  The response he got is only good  If he's giving a eulogy  That's the response you want  If you're a waxing poetic about a man's life  Yeah  And everyone's pausing to think  Right  But that did not get an applause  There is a man who has been in the ring  With the likes of Brent Harms  They're just yelling  You suck  You don't think it's good  He's terrible  There's you 
[04:19:30]  I'm saying is that a bad promo  It's not a good promo  Huh?  It's not a good promo  No I mean it's certainly not  I wouldn't like you  Not at all  Let's get  Stop the pain  Go ahead  Go ahead  No I mean no  It's not the best promo  That I've ever  Well you gotta  Listen  He's still young  He's up and coming  Into business  Yeah  It's true  He's young  He's up and coming  Into business  Company man  He'll get better  Yes  Company man 
[04:20:00]  You're way better than that  Is all we're trying  I'm still  I still got the other stuff  In my ears  In the background  Can you guys hear that?  Oh really?  Is it still playing?  Yeah  Oh really?  He'll shut it up  Okay now  It's funny  He's just using weird words  Right  There are men  Who have been  Bilked and duped  Give us  Oh the referee  Right  Give us one good story  From your WWE time  One good solid story  Behind the scenes 
[04:20:30]  Or whatever  Not you Jimmy  I'm trying to think  Of something that you guys  Would like  And it's funny  How about  Me  And The Rock  And my partner  D-Von  Doing YMCA  At a gay club  In Montreal  How's that?  That's pretty good  Drunk at 3am  Doing YMCA  At a  Wow  At an alternative  Lifestyle  Bar in Montreal  Whose idea was it  To go to  Pat Patterson  Who I think  Officially came out  Right? 
[04:21:00]  It's so funny  That Pat  Just came out  And before I go  Any farther  Pat Patterson  Genius in the  Wrestling industry  Love him  Great man  Very good friend  He's been  Openly gay  For forever  You know  And you know  But yeah  We went to  One of Pat's  Places that he  Likes to sing  Karaoke  And we did  And we did  You know  Karaoke YMCA  That's ironic  Ironic that he's  Gay and his name  Is Pat Patterson 
[04:21:30]  Rumors back  I gotta tell you  That time in the  Wrestling business  Was just  It was  It was awesome  It was like  Being a rock star  You guys were rock stars  It was crazy  How popular it got  That was mid 90s  Yeah  WWE New York  The restaurant on the block  Just you know  Performing at the garden  I remember coming on  You guys show  Right before  Performing on the garden  One time  And you had some  Chick in the studio  Who said she was  The queen of anal 
[04:22:00]  Oh wow  Tristan Taramino  Wow  I remember the day  Because it was so funny  So she said  That she was  The queen of anal  And you guys  Were known  I don't know  If you still do it  The whiffle ball bat challenge  Oh well  In our private lives  Alone  Bats got retired  Jimmy finally got to us  Jimmy basically  Pulled me aside  And said  What the fuck  Are we doing  And he was right  We're gonna get arrested  You with the voice of reason  More times than you think  I'm so paranoid 
[04:22:30]  About getting fired  Because I didn't get paid  Like these guys did  Yeah  So it's like  Yeah whatever  We'll get another  I have zero faith  No what happened was  We were only back  I swear maybe  A month  Maybe  Two months  Yeah the maximum  And we  We had the  Jaeger Meister machine  And these girls  Came in with this band  The band said  Hey man  These girls will come  And do crazy shit  Just so we could  Play a song  Or promote our band  And long story short  The morning ended  With a girl  Completely naked  On 57th street  Crying her eyes out  But she was drunk 
[04:23:00]  Before she came in  Fucking zooted  And they were doing  The whiffle ball bat challenge  To each other  But they were so wasted  That they were shoving it in  Way too far  Way too deep  And hurting each other  Yeah  And Jimmy's like  What the fuck  What are we doing  We just got back on radio  We're gonna get arrested  Some girls gonna have a  Or yeah  Some girls gonna have  An internal injury  With a bat shoved  In a box  And we're gonna have to  Try to explain that  The one girl  Tried to leave  Our studio  By walking behind  Anthony  And banging into a wall  Thinking that was  The way out  Tremendous classic  Not even a hint  That there was a door there 
[04:23:30]  And then maybe other things  Happened in the back office  With other people  I did fuck one of the girls  Okay  One eventually became  Ron and Fez's office  With no condom  And I came on the floor  Well this  The girl that was  In the studio  She was the queen  I gotta tell the rest  She was the queen of anal  And I said  Well why don't  Why don't you take  The whiffle ball bat challenge  You know  Up your noose  Yeah  And she didn't want to do  What she didn't want to do  And I told her  Listen I'll plug your book  In the middle of  Madison Square Garden  If you do it  And you guys looked at me  Like are you really 
[04:24:00]  Gonna do that  And I was like no  No  I remember that  So she said  Well I have to  Loosen myself up first  Right  And she dropped her drawers  And in a moment  Of stupidity  I went  Hey what's that white string  Hanging out of her  Oh right  Yes  I remember this now  The queen of anal  And I still get people  Who come to shows  Holding up signs  Doing hey Bubba  What's that white string  Oh really  Oh absolutely  On the old ragaroonie  Yeah  Well this was good  We're a pisser man

[04:34:30]  Mike Bocchetti.  Hey everybody, I'm comedian Mike Bocchetti.  I'm looking for Ms. Wright.  But Ms. Wrong will do it for a while too, as long as she's a good whore and takes it in the throat.  I'm looking for someone, it's like a hipster chick that looks like Ethel Mertz.  With those glasses, but she's a skanky skank.  That'll suck, fuck my socks off, that whore.  Someone like, that's a hipster librarian type, that's really a skank when you get her in bed. 
[04:35:00]  Just what he called, just have a bang of tits and screw that whore and have her give me a good one.  My ideal date would be something kind of romantic and then she becomes a whore after that, want to bring her home.  By a whore I mean like, she's like sucking bananas saying I want to suck that banana.  She's choking on it, gagging on it, shooting cum in that fucking whore's face for a while just like, and then fucking his life out of that skank.  Maybe eating some snacks if she's clean, I don't know.  I was born in 1961, I hope my wife or girlfriend was born in the mid-80s.  She don't even know who the fuck Max Headroom is, I'm the fuck she's going to fuck me, you know what I mean? 
[04:35:30]  I love this, you know.  She would make that whore give me a handjob and then fucking tell her to shut the fuck up.  Get in the kitchen you whore and fucking make me something to eat.  Lunchtime, you know, I'm getting healthy now, so just make me a salad and then suck my banana.  If that is something you'll be into, call me Mike Bocchetti at 866-WOW-1-WOW, 866-969-1969.  And put that banana in my mouth and choke on it, honey. 
[04:36:00]  Call the Opie and Anthony show today.  Mike Bocchetti does.  Unfortunately, the Opie and Anthony show is over.  Fortunately, we have a hard time letting go.  The stories behind the stories.  The backstage drama.  Everything that made today unforgettable.  Call 866-WOW-1-WOW now. 
[04:36:30]  And look back on another legendary day of broadcasting.  This is the Opie and Anthony post show.  With Sam Roberts.  Here we go.  With the post show.  I sound like shit.  I'm kidding.  You should have seen Mars' face.  You got very scared for a second.  Yes, I did.  Yes, sir.  Hey, you know what?  I wanted to talk to you about your intro. 
[04:37:00]  Very heavy beat.  Like it, man.  You like it.  Like it.  What is that?  It's a Kanye West beat.  Oh, okay.  Yeah.  You like Kanye West, don't you?  Oh, I sweat him.  Hard, as they say.  Yeah?  Yeah.  Like the wife, too, huh?  Kim Kardashian?  That's right.  What's going on here is Mars making conversation because he's trying to test the microphones.  Test, test, test.  That's all I want to do.  We don't have to pretend to have a conversation.  Okay, we don't have to pretend we like each other?  No, not at all.  Okay.  No, we don't have to.  Fucking Mike.  Test, test, test, test.  Pretend to have anything in common. 
[04:37:30]  Yeah, the guys, we got them here for about ten minutes.  Maybe not quite, but seven minutes after the show, which is a huge accomplishment, isn't it?  It is, it is.  Ten minutes.  To test these microphones, because Mars, he pulled me aside, he's like, look, I test these microphones every day, every morning.  I get Anthony for two minutes here, I get Obi for two minutes there.  He said, it's not going to work unless we hear their voices into their microphones at the same time. 
[04:38:00]  We basically have to create a scenario that is the show.  Exactly.  Because otherwise, 6.30 a.m. is going to roll around, those mics are going to come on and say, why does it sound different?  Imagine, I'm in this room by myself, one little mic open, I talk into it, it sounds fantastic.  But then here comes 6.30, rolls it around, all the mics are open, there's someone in front of each mic, people cross-talking, and all that good stuff.  Intro's playing.  Right.  It's like, hey, it sounds like shit. 
[04:38:30]  Right, and there are all these sound sources coming at you, and you have no idea what's going on.  So are you confident now, I mean, Anthony, Obi, Jim, we're all in here, Tim Sabian, the big boss who's in here watching you, breathing down your neck?  Yes, and it's interesting, where are my people at, man?  Who?  My engineers.  Yeah, they left me, left my ass by myself.  And Mars told me during the show, he's like, give me a heads up before they end the show, so I can bring the other engineers in.  And I did, and none of the engineers followed you.  I got one in the back, he was doing adjustments, but my big boss didn't come down. 
[04:39:00]  And he was way in the back, too.  No, I don't know who did that.  Somebody else was doing adjustments, there's no evidence of that ever happening.  So you're asking me if I'm confident, I'm as confident as they said they sounded good to them.  Now, is there something, because Ron and Fez come in this studio, Ron and Fez are on Raw Dog from noon to three,  but they broadcast their Raw Dog show out of this studio.  Is there, do they have totally separate settings?  Is there any cross-pollination that's going to happen? 
[04:39:30]  They have the same settings.  The interesting thing about Ron and Fez is that Ron doesn't wear his headphones.  Okay.  So he puts his headphones out to the side like a little loudspeaker.  So is that to say if the mics are fucked up, he doesn't know?  To him, he hears his voice.  That's all he needs.  Tim came to me and he was like, how come your mics are never fucked up?  And I said, just because I don't complain about them.  I don't point out that they're fucked up.  Usually people don't either.  You know, but I do understand some people, you know, that bothers them because that's their... 
[04:40:00]  And if you're doing a daily show and that's what you're here for,  and it is supposed to sonically...  Right.  That's the medium we work in, right?  I totally agree.  Yeah.  But I also agree to give me some time before or after the show so we can get it to your liking.  Right.  Right.  Gwet it.  Gwet it.  He said gwet it.  Try to get it to your liking.  That's all I asked for.  Just a few minutes.  And you feel like it was there.  Should we test the phones to make sure that they're working properly with the new mics?  No, no, no.  We're good to go.  You don't think we're going to have to daisy chain anything?  No, Anthony has two red LEDs up on top. 
[04:40:30]  Right here?  All the way on top.  Up here.  Yeah.  Okay.  Are there two red LEDs?  They're lit up, yes.  Two red...  Good.  That means he could talk to the phone.  R-E-C and U-T-L.  Both lit up.  Red.  Oh, you're talking about the one and the two?  Yes.  Yes, they're both lit up.  The one and the two are lit up for every single microphone.  Good.  Yes.  That means that they can talk to the callers.  This is going to be exciting.  Let's find out.  John in Virginia. 
[04:41:00]  Johnny!  Oh, wait, wait, wait.  Okay.  What happened?  What happened?  No, that was my fault.  What happened?  You turned off...  The phones are usually left on, but when you were testing the board, obviously you turned  off the phones.  Okay.  That was a panic minute.  Panic!  The phones were not turned on.  John, are you there?  I am.  How are you?  Great primetime Sam Roberts.  Doing very well.  I think we're on to something big for tomorrow's show.  This studio is going to sound...  I mean, you listeners are going to have no idea.  what you've been missing when you hear, sonically, the quality that comes out of this studio 
[04:41:30]  tomorrow.  You know, I would expect nothing less from the great Marzolito.  Thank you.  Marzolito is your name, right?  Marzolito.  Thank you.  Hey, you know, talking about bad audio, has that Lady Di put a bullet in her head yet?  We can only hope.  I mean, we haven't heard from Lady Di in a few days, so the general...  I mean, I'm not going to say she's not...  I can't say she's not dead, for sure.  Right.  You know?  But we can hope.  Yeah, well, I mean, sure. 
[04:42:00]  We can all...  That's what we have, our hopes and prayers.  Travis in New York.  How's it going, Sam?  Good, buddy.  I was just wondering if the Jim Norton Advice Show is on today.  Unfortunately, Jim's Advice Show is postponed this afternoon due to work with his Vice Show.  Not to be confused with the Advice Show.  Jim Norton's Advice Show will be back next week and then every Wednesday thereafter.  That's when it'll be on regularly, but right now he's got his other commitments that he's  working on in the afternoon. 
[04:42:30]  Cool, Sam.  All right, buddy.  Lady Trucker.  Now, if these mics and the phones work with Lady Trucker, it's going to work with anybody.  I mean, we're golden, right?  Come on, Lady Trucker, give it to me.  Good morning, Sam.  That's going to get her all...  By the way, you saying that to her, she called me on Friday, on the Friday show.  Okay.  And it doesn't take much.  She said her truck seat was soaking wet.  I mean, she is a horned up woman.  I'm pretty sure she has a lot of suitors.  You think so?  You think the truck stop is full of people? 
[04:43:00]  Yeah.  I hear Lady Trucker's supposed to be driving by here today.  A lot of suitors.  That's the talk of the truck spot.  Yeah.  What's going on, Lady Trucker?  Hey, I was wondering, could you let me know what the bully's Twitter handle is again?  I believe it's RealBully5150 on Twitter.  That's Bully Ray, formerly known as Bubba Ray Dudley.  All right, thank you, Sam.  All right, I'll talk to you later.  That Bubba Ray Dudley, Bully Ray, he's a big motherfucker, huh?  Big dude.  Yeah. 
[04:43:30]  Not as big as Mr. Greenstein, though.  Who's Mr. Greenstein?  Yeah, I got a call from Mr. Greenstein about the mics.  You did?  Well, my boss.  Oh, boy.  So that's why you're in a little bit of a panic.  I've been in a panic for about two weeks now.  Wow.  Because you're sitting there.  I've been working on this fucking mic issue for two weeks now.  Yeah.  Trying to get it right.  Well, I mean, no, that's true.  Every day, almost every show, there's been something else wrong.  Anthony's been on another thing, or the buttons don't work right, or the mic doesn't sound right. 
[04:44:00]  And it's not that the equipment at this point is not functioning.  It's the operator.  It's you.  It's that I'm trying to get it to whatever he likes, you know, whatever he needs, because  he needs control of the mic.  He needs to sound good in his headphones.  And those two things are not jiving at the moment.  Today, they are.  How does it disappear?  Like, how, what did, that is the question that always comes up.  Like, when they are, because they have been, I guess, happy with the way the studio has  sounded before.  How has that gone away?  That started two weeks ago with his original mic setting on that board. 
[04:44:30]  Yeah.  When Kapoot, as you notice, I moved him to a different fader altogether.  It seems to me that all this trouble started with your pranks.  When you came in and started pranking.  No, no, no.  And I feel like maybe you're practical joking.  No.  Because if you remember, we came back from vacation, and you were full of jokes, and  you had the mic sounding bad.  Right.  The mics have not sounded good since that prank, have they?  Well, after that prank, remember, they still didn't sound to par, so we took the frame 
[04:45:00]  out.  And for those of you that, you know, this is very boring.  I mean, I'll tell you what happened is, the prank happened, and then the mic still sounded  bad, and so I came in two weeks ago for the very first Friday show, and Mars was like,  it ain't gonna happen, nothing here.  Because the studio was in pieces.  Oh, yes.  That's what happened.  Yes.  Yes.  And, well, they realized also, the muckety mucks realized that the equipment is in a  bad position.  Meaning physically in a bad position.  Physically in a bad position, underneath the operator's legs, I can't get to it. 
[04:45:30]  And when you actually do get to it, the wires themselves have no slack, it's just a mess.  It's not done properly.  Now, did they realize that the reason Opie doesn't want you fidgeting with stuff is because  you've been under his console before for other reasons, and he's not interested?  Well, actually, Opie's very interested when I go under the console.  He is.  He likes it.  You know, he likes those moments.  He does.  He does.  My apologies, Sam Mars.  It might be that it's habit-forming, and he's having a problem with it now, so he might 
[04:46:00]  not want me under the console as much.  Because it feels comfortable.  It feels like home.  He's not in the broadcasting mentality.  I understand.  Let's go to Kyle in Boston.  Hey, primetime Sam Roberts.  Sounding great today, buddy.  Thank you.  That's all Mars.  That's not me.  My voice is a terrible, terrible voice.  If it sounds good at all, it's because of the great Mars Salido.  It's getting deeper, though, by the way.  Is it?  I don't know.  You're growing up.  Maybe that's what's finally happening.  Balls drop?  Yeah, one ball was dropped.  I'm still waiting on the other one.  So, Monday, I turned on Hand Nation to listen to Eddie Trunk's show, and for the first 15 
[04:46:30]  minutes, all I heard was Fred Mills recording awful promos and coughing and sneezing over  Eddie Trunk's show.  He just kept going to the channel, whatever, the message, great, classic, Catholic rock,  and then he would just start coughing, and then to reset and try to record it again for  15 minutes.  So, somebody was trying to run a show and then thought they'd record some promos, and 
[04:47:00]  they were going over the air.  Mars, did you play a joke on Eddie Trunk?  Were you playing pranks on the truckster?  I'm telling you, man, things like that happened throughout the building.  Well, I know, years ago, it was so embarrassing.  Not as embarrassing as the Adam Walsh incident, but it was still embarrassing.  This one wasn't my fault.  Of course not.  It never is.  Well, the Adam Walsh thing was kind of my fault.  But this one was not.  No, this one definitely wasn't.  And it was when E-Rock and I came into this studio to record Worst of voiceovers. 
[04:47:30]  And I said, E-Rock, you got the studio all set up?  And he goes, yep.  And then we turn on the mics and start recording voiceovers over the air.  We start getting tweets like, you fucking idiots are on the air.  The profit was still running?  Yeah.  Yeah, and so over the replay that was playing, you could hear myself and Eric Nagel introing  the weekend's best of clips.  Nice, nice.  I did that on purpose, by the way, because I need to hear off mic. 
[04:48:00]  Is that a prank?  Or you just need to hear what it sounds like?  You just need to hear what it sounds like off mic.  Okay, that wasn't a prank?  No.  You still working on your next prank?  No, nah, you know what, man?  I'm done with, even though the prank was, I thought it was a good one, but I'm just  done with fucking with the equipment unless I necessarily have to.  So you are retiring from the practical joke business?  Absolutely.  Retiring a champion, though.  You think so?  Oh, that first one, you nailed him.  I'll tell you, I got nailed here one time.  You did?  Really good.  What happened?  By a guy that's not funny. 
[04:48:30]  You got nailed by a guy.  Prank-wise.  In this studio.  Adrian, Adrian's in the studio, your friend there.  You know your friend, right?  The one that we talk about in the mornings.  Who?  Who?  Tell me.  No, no, no, we don't need to do that.  Is it a host?  No, it's another engineer.  Oh.  So we were, one morning, I used to do, I used to, uh...  Are you pranking me?  You gotta put your phone on vibrate, Mars.  No, there was probably someone, a boss of mine, saying,  Hey, I'll be there to help you in a second.  But no. 
[04:49:00]  So we were, um, when I first started here,  I used to go with, uh, Howard Stern, uh, engineer,  and we used to do push-ups.  Okay.  Okay?  We used to go over to Studio 2 and do push-ups.  Okay.  And it was a set of three.  When would you do this?  Early morning.  Okay, before the show.  Before the show.  And this cat runs in, and this is when we first got here.  Okay.  This cat comes in here, and he goes,  very serious, very, uh, monotone, the way this individual is,  and he says,  Which one of you guys is gonna explain to, uh, Mr. Greenstein 
[04:49:30]  that ONA is going over the Oprah channel?  What?  Dude, let me tell you.  And you're sitting there going like,  I gotta get one more rep in.  I gotta get one more rep in.  Hell no, I fucking...  I'm feeling the pump.  I jumped, man.  I was, I jumped out of there, ran over to, uh, you know.  Because you know what that sounds like.  The boss says, well, where was the engineer  when this is going over the channel?  And this guy's gonna be like,  Howard, who's fucking, this guy's doing push-ups.  But not only that, you had ONA over Oprah. 
[04:50:00]  Remember when Oprah first came on?  It was, it was the worst channel for ONA to be playing over.  Yes, exactly.  A hundred percent worse.  So...  And it was really happening?  No.  It just, you know, a prank.  Oh, it was a prank.  Yes.  I thought you meant you had made a blunder.  No, no.  He got you.  That type of blunder, I wouldn't admit to on air.  You would not.  Even years later.  Shit, not even years later.  You kidding me?  Good for you.  That's right.  Good for you.  But, uh, but he got you.  You panicked.  Oh, absolutely.  I panicked big time.  You know, I care for what the fuck I do.  Unlike, you know, some people saying they don't care. 
[04:50:30]  I care.  Right.  Right.  You had to keep those jobs.  Jeez.  Right.  Got a mortgage to pay, goddammit.  Right.  So I care.  Mows to feed.  There's a bunch of little Marcelitos at home thinking they're getting...  No, not a bunch.  Three.  That's a bunch.  No.  Right?  No.  It's more than a couple.  No.  Several Marcelitos.  When are you going to have a little Sam is what I'm talking about.  I don't know, but I'm going to tell you, I will raise that child in my image and  he'll be godlike.  Ugh.  I, uh, I don't know. 
[04:51:00]  At some point.  At some point.  I gotta keep banking money, you know what I mean?  You're not getting any younger?  No, I'm not.  No, I'm not.  I mean, now, I mean, it's starting within the next few years.  You know, it's time.  What are you, 35 now?  No, I'm 30, Marks.  I'm sorry.  I'm 30.  No, it's cool, but you, I mean, I'm 30.  You met me when I was like 22, probably.  No, really?  Really?  Yeah, I think so.  You look 35, though.  Okay, it's 30 is how old I am.  Okay, 30 is, my age is, my age is 30.  Okay.  Uh, Mike in Canada.  Hey, Brian, how's it going? 
[04:51:30]  And a lot of people say I look young, by the way.  A lot of people do say that, but go ahead, Mike.  Uh, hey, first I got a question.  What's it?  Did Mars just say, that cat?  Did he just say that, really?  Did he?  What year is it?  Mars did, look.  I'm 49 years old, man.  Mars is 49, and even though he was born and raised in this country, he never...  Yeah, he just looked good for my age.  He doesn't look 49.  I know, he looks 54, 56.  Stop that.  Stop the truth.  Go ahead, Drew.  It's in the gut.  It's in the gut.  I look good for my age.  But, uh, he, even though he's 49, he still has not managed, in those 49 years, to grasp 
[04:52:00]  the English language, like a lot of us have.  So, not only is he a little older to the slang, but he never had it to begin with, because  he just says weird shit.  Sam, not everyone's on the same sheet of music, dude.  Hey, hey, don't go for my statement, buddy.  You're right.  He hung up.  He was asking about, uh, advice from Roland for food.  You gotta reach out to Roland on Twitter.  Twitter, uh...  Don't we love talking about food on this, uh, channel?

I heard somebody was throwing cereal, and people kept eating sandwiches over the board.  Okay, you wanna get serious?  Yeah.  That Friday, when I took this board apart?  Yeah.  Dude, behind those modules there, we got like five, six of them modules right there.  Did you sure?  You felt the stickiness of, of the, the sugar, of the coffee.  Oh, Jesus.  It was all over in there.  And, like, mouthing marshmallows from Lucky Charms.  There was dust of a cereal.  There was, right?

And we've heard this broadcast.
