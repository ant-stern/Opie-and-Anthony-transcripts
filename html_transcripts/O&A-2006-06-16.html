<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show began with the hosts, Opie, Anthony, and Jim Norton, engaging in their typical self-deprecating humor, referring to themselves as "rabid radio retards" and other insults.  They announced a name change for the show to "Savage Animals," briefly considering the alternative, the offensively racist "Klu Klux Klux Klowns." A significant portion of the show detailed a drunken encounter with Al Jorgensen of Ministry, who was drenched in sweat after excessive red wine consumption. Anthony expressed his disgust at Jorgensen's excessively enthusiastic, wet hug.  A caller then recounted wrecking his semi-truck from laughing at a story about Jorgensen and his bandmate's acid trip at a zoo, which allegedly involved an attempted sexual assault of an ostrich.  The hosts later mentioned the presence of two porn stars in the studio post-show.  A discussion about global warming ensued, sparked by Anthony's dismissive attitude and Steve Lynch's passionate concern. This led to a heated, humorous exchange with callers and in-studio guests Steve Lynch and Bill Burr. The show heavily promoted their upcoming "Opie and Anthony Traveling Virus" comedy tour, listing the comedians involved.  Opie shared a humorous anecdote about a homeless man sleeping on a discarded couch outside his building.

This transitioned into a discussion of their "Homeless Radio" segment, featuring Tippi Tom and Blue, who hilariously misinterpreted "trans fat" as "cat" in a news story about a KFC lawsuit.  Audio clips from Homeless Radio showcased their reactions to current events, including global warming and the death of a high-profile terrorist. The show then covered baseball, specifically the Yankees-Red Sox rivalry,  critiquing Shea Stadium and the Mets' colors (a caller later clarifying their origin in the New York State flag).  Jim Norton's recent appearance on Jay Leno was discussed, including clips from his stand-up routine covering his parents, dating, and condoms, along with his interaction with Kate Beckinsale and subsequent exchange of contact information.  The upcoming Opie and Anthony comedy tour was again promoted.

A substantial portion of the broadcast focused on the "Opie and Anthony Traveling Virus" tour, detailing dates (Augusta, Maine; Worcester, MA; PNC Bank Arts Center in New Jersey; Tweeter Center in Camden, NJ) and the lineup (Rich Voss, Patrice O'Neill, Bill Burr, Bob Kelly, Tracy Morgan, Bob Saget, Carlos Mencia, and Jim Norton).  Jim Norton's infatuation with Kate Beckinsale was a recurring theme.  In-studio guest Stephen Lynch discussed his Broadway show ("The Wedding Singer"), his past of singing "dirty songs," and played a graphic song, "Kill a Kitten." His Broadway experiences and transition from summer stock were also covered.  A significant portion detailed a physical altercation involving a listener who verbally attacked the hosts during their "walk," pushing producer Ben before being restrained by security (Kenny and Poe).  Audio of the event was played.

The show continued with a detailed discussion of the physical altercation, this time focusing on "Little Jimmy," who had previously bombed on the show, and his confrontation with producer Ben, resulting in a takedown by security, including Anthony Cumia's karate instructor, "Master Po."  Callers provided various accounts and opinions, often using vulgar language.  Pete Popolardo provided updates on the successful ticket sales for the comedy tour, leading to further banter and insults directed at Howard Stern and his listeners.  A caller reported a promotional poster found on the subway.  The discussion of Little Jimmy's altercation continued, with many offensive remarks from the hosts and callers.  Davis Guggenheim, director of *An Inconvenient Truth*, called in for an interview about climate change, though the conversation frequently veered off-topic.

The final segment heavily featured the successful comedy festival, with Pete Pavillardo providing ticket sales updates, and discussions about adding an open mic stage and a surprise band.  A significant portion was dedicated to playing and discussing clips of a Dateline NBC interview with Britney Spears, with crude and offensive commentary on her appearance, parenting, and mental state.  Specific incidents, like a baby falling from a high chair and a near-trip, were mocked. The hosts attempted to elicit a crying response from Spears. The show concluded with more comedic banter, opening a mysterious box, further guest appearances (Bill Burr, Rich Vos), and off-color jokes before an abrupt sign-off.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  It's the O.P. and Anthony Show on XM202 featuring O.P., Anthony, and James Norton.  What?  Can you hear me?  No!  Right off!  I'm me and Anthony!  We're so excited to be back.  Rabid radio retards.  Wow!  We're dummies!  We're the only radio show that makes you want to hate us.  We've been known to get our faces in the news.  We're perverts.  Stupid.  We stink.  We just love doing radio.  This is a weird show.  No one puts asses in the seat like Greg and Tony. 
[00:00:30]  O.P.  I love the hitting and the fighting.  Anthony.  I'm a terrorist looking for other terrorists.  James.  I'm a speechless, worthless nothing.  We all know that.  I love women.  I'm a slump, fat pig.  And a crew of misfits.  Hurricane Ben!  Ben looks like a tall baby.  He looks like Chuckie.  Martini Steve!  Steve is a piece of garbage.  Perfectly enunciating fool that we paint him out to be.  Right.  E-Rock!  Oh, please, go into a car wash with his mouth open.  I bring nothing to the table.  I don't care.  Shut up. 
[00:01:00]  No.  What's wrong, Eric?  My closet's burning so bad.  Sit down and put on your laughing hats.  Just relax.  Here comes the funny.  Welcome to the Opian House.  Shut up!  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road.  Dun, dun, dun.  Right.  You can't say a word until the three bass drum hits. 
[00:01:30]  Boom, boom, boom.  I like the boom, boom, bam.  It's Friday!  It is Friday!  It's Friday!  Well, we're waiting.  All right, all right.  Oh, yay Boogie.  We have a huge announcement today.  We have officially changed the name of the radio show. 
[00:02:00]  Oh, really?  From now on, we want to be known as Savage Animals.  Savage Animals.  I'm a savage animal.  You're a savage animal.  You're a savage animal.  We're all savage animals.  The show is a savage animal.  My fan, it just rolls off the tongue.  Dude, give me five seconds before you say anything.  Let it sink in. 
[00:02:30]  Savage Animals.  What a tool.  Sebastian is a tool.  Sebastian Bach from...  I know, but what's the show on VH1?  Supergroup.  Supergroup.  So we want to be known as Savage Animals.  Ripping them off.  It's going to look good on a t-shirt.  Savage Animal.  Your morning starts with the Savage Animals.  That does sound like it could be one of those shows. 
[00:03:00]  I know.  Join the Savage Animals every morning at 6.  They're going to have a savage party this weekend at Hooters.  Or we could call ourselves the Klu Klux Klux Klowns.  Yeah.  Klu Klux Klowns.  One of the greatest band names ever.  That hasn't been used yet, by the way.  That's Al Jorgensen's from Ministry, by the way. 
[00:03:30]  Don't take that one.  Don't take that one.  What a lunatic.  The Klu Klux Klowns.  There's a lot of people that didn't hear the second half of the Opie and Anthony show on XM Satellite Radio yesterday.  Yeah.  I finally left the show around 10.30 because I had tickets to the U.S. Open.  I'll get into that maybe a little later.  My stories are boring compared to what I was listening to on the radio after I left.  By the way.  But we had Al Jorgensen and his bass player, was it? 
[00:04:00]  Yeah.  Who still had his makeup on for the night before.  His eyeliner, yeah.  His eyeliner, whatever.  They were drinking lots and lots of red wine.  And like wine, they're just chugging it down.  They were hammered.  Right.  And sweating profusely.  Yeah.  I got to give Steve the picture that I took with Al at the end of it.  The guy was so funny.  He's like, I got to get a picture with this guy.  Yeah.  This guy's such a rock star.  He won't even promote where the hell he's at.  Yeah.  And I was just like, I got to get a picture with this guy. 
[00:04:30]  So I'm just like, Al, can I get a picture?  And he's like, all right, you knucklehead.  And he comes walking over.  And he's dressed all in black, so I couldn't tell.  And I go to put my arm around him.  And it was literally like he had just stepped out of a pool.  Like you're hugging a sponge.  Not even kidding how wet he was.  It wasn't just damp.  He was sopping wet.  Oh, yeah.  It's like that Ben Stiller movie where the shirtless guy goes by him in basketball.  It was disgusting.  So I immediately am like, oh, my God.  I'm like, you know, quickly take the picture. 
[00:05:00]  And he does the thing where he leans in with his head up against my head.  Which is also just soaking wet.  Oh, just a cloud of hepatitis.  Yeah.  Floating over me.  There was heat coming off of him.  Right.  There was like an actual heat emanating from him as he was sweating.  So Bill comes up to me because I'm still in the studio.  And so is everyone else.  And he goes, dude, he's soaking wet.  I just took a picture with him.  And it's disgusting how wet he is. 
[00:05:30]  My shoulder on my T-shirt was like wet.  Just soaked through, right?  He goes, it's wet.  So now I got to try to plot my escape because I don't want to be touched by sweaty guy.  I don't care if he's a rock star or not.  You know, the guy gave us great radio.  He was hysterically funny.  But he's soaking wet with sweat.  I'm out of there.  And it was totally the moment where you attract what you fear.  Right, right.  He had that posture of whatever you do, don't come up to me.  Al sensed my fear like a German shepherd. 
[00:06:00]  And as I'm trying to slip out, he goes, hey, man, comes over to me.  So I know I'm going to have to sacrifice something in lieu of the hug.  And for the new listeners, you've got to understand, Anthony, possibly a germaphobe at this point.  Nah, not a germaphobe.  Not a germaphobe.  I'll be clear about it because I have no problem with it.  I'm a disgusting thing-a-phobe.  Like, I don't care.  Germs don't bother me.  I've dropped food on the floor, picked it up, and ate it.  I don't care.  You guys are rebels.  Wow, look at you.  I'm a madman. 
[00:06:30]  You're ready to be a savage animal, man.  Crazy, savage animal.  But I don't like disgusting things.  I don't like bodily fluids from anybody.  Anything.  Out of the ears, the nose.  Like, people that blow their nose and then open the tissue.  I'm like, why?  I can't even look at my own.  Like, I'll blow my nose.  I've got to be in front of a mirror because I've got to make sure everything's clean.  And then I'll take it and kind of, like, take a tissue and roto-rooter. 
[00:07:00]  That's what the fingers are mean.  No, no.  And then pull out, make sure everything's clean.  And it's like a wrench set, too.  You've got all different sizes.  Different sizes.  Depending on what you need done.  Metric hand.  Right.  Allen wrenches.  Yeah, exactly.  But I need another.  So I'm a disgusting phobe.  I just don't like disgusting things.  It's not a germ thing.  I want to go outside or not.  What you're basically saying is you don't like alcoholic back sweat.  Right.  There you go.  Drunken.  Sweating like he's on crystal meth kind of sweat.  I don't want near me or on me or anything. 
[00:07:30]  I picked the wrong day to go home early.  I was so bummed.  Oh, it was great.  Go ahead.  So I figure I slip out the door.  He comes up to me.  Now I know I'm going to have to sacrifice something.  My hand.  My hand's going to have to be sacrificed.  I'll shake his hand.  I'll go into the bathroom.  Wash.  I'm out.  No, it didn't stop at the handshake.  He grabbed my hand and shook it.  And then he grabs my other arm with his arm, pulls me in for, like, the back smack hug thing.  He's like, ah, come here. 
[00:08:00]  And it was just wetness.  Oh, he got inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame hug.  It was awful.  I think he's been inducted into the Opie and Anthony Hall of Fame.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, without a doubt.  That, too, was one of the funniest as far as the shows I've been on.  Let's go to Donnie in Iowa.  Donnie, what's up?  Hi, guys.  Y'all owe me $75,000.  Why?  I was listening on XM on the replay last night, and the guy talking about the ostrich in the zoo. 
[00:08:30]  Yeah.  I got to laughing so hard, I wrecked my damn semi.  See, that's why we got the greatest jobs in radio.  We got the best of both worlds.  We love the fact we're back on commercial radio because we get to reach a lot more people right away.  And then we still get to do all the crazy, dirty stuff for XM after this show ends.  And Al Jorgensen of Ministry with his bass player there, we're describing a story of tripping on acid overseas at a zoo.  So after everyone went home, they hid in one of the bathrooms until the zoo closed, dropped some acid, and decided to walk around the zoo just looking at the animals tripping. 
[00:09:00]  Right.  So they're walking around, and they pass by the ostrich enclosure.  And it's at night, so one of the ostriches has its head kind of on the ground.  I think that's where the rumor came from, that they actually bury their head in the sand when they're scared.  They kind of sleep a little weird.  And the rest of the ostrich is stuck up in the air. 
[00:09:30]  Its head is in the ground.  Its body is kind of perched high in the air.  At this point, one of the keyboard, I believe it was a keyboard tech that he was with, decided it was a good time to perform some type of ostrich sexual assault.  Put it this way, the ostrich with its head in the ground was looking for its rape whistle.  Yeah.  It had to alert the authorities because this guy decided, tripping on acid in a zoo at night, that that was the time for amore. 
[00:10:00]  Amore.  A little ostrich love was going to happen that night.  And the way Al described it, he described the guy just starting, and he goes,  And the ostrich was pissed!  It's like, yeah.  No doubt that's going to anger an ostrich.  Yeah.  I'm sure they don't like it when another ostrich is doing it. 
[00:10:30]  This is probably one of those nature fights.  You ever see, it never looks like animals are enjoying themselves in that act.  Like lions will sit down, and then the male will do what he's supposed to do, and the female's kind of laying there.  But at some point, the female just goes,  Like, turns around and bites them.  Or most of the time, they just sit there and just eat.  Well, it's being done to them.  They're eating.  What, Donnie?  Jesus!  Yes.  If somebody out there does not have X in them, and they're listening to you on regular radio, they're missing the best part of the show. 
[00:11:00]  All right.  Well, I wouldn't say the best part, sir.  Well, I have never heard a show.  He's still talking all my life.  Hey, Donnie, what are you hauling?  What do you want?  What are you hauling in your truck?  Thank you, Donnie.  We greatly appreciate the support there.  I think we need to explain to the terrestrial, the FM listeners, if you will, and AM at this point now.  Sure.  Detroit.  The satellite radio draws in a lot of truck drivers. 
[00:11:30]  We love the truck drivers.  Because they can go coast to coast without having to change the station, which is a great thing.  But they yap.  They can talk.  They are so alone in that cab.  How long can you talk to the dead hooker body that's in the sleeper next to you?  You need some more human interaction.  So they don't shut up.  The dead Denny's waitress.  The hooker.  The frigging girl he picked up at the truck stop. 
[00:12:00]  Just some decomposing body in his sleeper cab.  Yeah, so it got crazy on the second half of the Opie and Anthony show yesterday.  And I left with Al Jorgensen just completely hammered with his bandmate.  And two porn stars getting ready to just do crazy, crazy stuff over there.  And I had to take off and go check out the U.S. Open yesterday.  What a bad, bad timing on my part.  Yeah, what porn stars did we have?  We had Samantha.  I don't remember. 
[00:12:30]  Rachel Ray.  Sunset.  Oh, Rebecca Love.  And Sunset Thomas.  Right.  Sunset Thomas.  I thought it was Rachel Ray.  It wasn't her?  No.  It was Sunset Thomas.  I kept calling her Jenna.  Did you really?  Oh, she was getting pissed.  She was getting so angry.  But then they brought out some toys and stuff and started doing things.  And Al was just, you know, doing some commentary.  It was really a lot of fun. 
[00:13:00]  He was obsessed with Sam, one of our guys.  Sam.  Who was filming the whole thing.  Mm-hmm.  And he was calling him a weirdo.  A weirdo.  He was like, you're a weirdo.  Look at you with that camera.  Get in there.  Like he's forcing him to get closer to the action.  I don't think he wanted to be that close to.  Right.  Talking about how his face was expressionless.  Yeah.  Because he was filming all of it.  But he was obsessed with you, Sam.  He's got a job to do and he's just doing it.  Look at him, you weirdo. 
[00:13:30]  He didn't like you very much.  Yeah, I guess I wasn't displaying any emotion while I was filming.  You're a consummate professional.  Yeah, you were focused.  He called me a bicycle seat sniffer.  Yeah.  Amongst other things, he certainly did.  Apparently he called Ben after the show and called him after the show.  After he's home, I'm driving home.  And Ben called me to tell me that Al called him to make sure that Ben realized I was a creep.  And I guess Al Jorgensen refused to leave. 
[00:14:00]  Like I left early.  And people are asking, did you listen to the show on the way to the open?  Absolutely.  I was laughing my ass off.  Yeah.  And then Anthony left.  I left the second we were done with the show.  I said, all right, we'll see you tomorrow.  I could not get out the door fast enough.  I got my soggy hug.  He felt like he was trying to sneak into a movie.  Because he was like, oh, I couldn't get out of there.  There were too many people that I didn't want to touch in the studio.  So I just, I bolted out of there. 
[00:14:30]  I didn't even, one of my best friends, Adam Ferraro, was on yesterday.  I didn't even say goodbye to him.  I left, I'm in my truck and I realized, I'm like, oh my God.  So I called him up and left a message.  I was like, Adam, thanks for coming on.  You know, you had a lot of fun today on the show.  And I just had to get out of there.  And Al Jorgensen of ministry, after that, he just stayed in studio and just continued  to obsess on saying, you're a weirdo.  Because they gave him wine.  And he finally left, but it took forever, like a half hour, 40 minutes later. 
[00:15:00]  Yeah, they had to chase him out.  His wife was trying to convince him to leave and he just, he wasn't leaving.  No, he had a great time.  Wine will do that to a person, I guess.  Yep.  The wine thing doesn't make sense, you know?  What, a rock star drinking the wine?  Yeah.  I think that's the daytime, that's the daytime beverage.  It almost feels like they're drinking grape juice or something that isn't really alcohol.  I'm sure at night, it's all about Jack Daniels and just pounding and acid ostriches. 
[00:15:30]  Ostriches, yeah.  They look like middle-aged Lost Boys.  Remember that movie?  But the video of the ostrich story, I guess, is up on our fine website that we're not allowed  to promote yet.  Hear him tell it in all of its fine detail.  We're going to have a meeting about all that stuff next week and figure out some things.  Yeah, we've got to figure out how to do it.  This is a very interactive radio show.  We have to be able to promote our websites and our message boards and all that stuff. 
[00:16:00]  You Google our names, believe me.  Yeah, but our main website has Al Jorgensen telling the ostrich story.  It is really, really funny.  It is so out there.  It's one of the funniest things we ever had on the radio, I think.  But we can't tell you how to get to it.  No, of course not.  So the next show.  Of course not.  That doesn't make sense.  It's the internet.  You know how to find it.  Who can't find anything on the internet anymore?  It's their Lost.  Yeah, but the people that are working behind the scenes that have nothing to do with our  show but have a lot to do with this station we're on, they should realize that it's really 
[00:16:30]  important for us to be able to promote our websites, and they should try to figure out  how to get this done.  I understand.  They should have had this done already.  Yep.  I don't know what they're waiting for.  If you understand the Opie and Anthony show, that's very, very important to us.  We like to interact with our listeners more than any other radio show out there.  So they need to get their asses in gear and figure it out for us.  I agree, and that will be done.  We will have our meeting. 
[00:17:00]  Well, we've been here almost two months.  We're heading toward two months quickly now.  In the meantime.  And we're the ones that have to push the issue.  Yeah.  You know, you've got to understand who you hired.  We're very interactive.  We have lots of websites out there.  We're putting video up online every single night, aggressively, like a ton of stuff every  night, and we can't promote it yet?  That's stupid.  Yeah.  Just for the record.  Figure it out.  I can't find stuff on the internet.  No?  I would literally type in the New England Patriots, and it'll say, New England Patriots 
[00:17:30]  official site, and I click on it, and it's like a sale on washers and dryers.  It's fake like Patriots site.  You've got to watch.  The latest thing that really annoys the hell out of me is you put in some keywords, you  hit search, something that seems perfect comes up, and you click, and it's just another  search engine.  Oh, yeah.  With a couple of the keywords you put in, and then 20 other things that have nothing  to do with what you were talking about.  Yeah.  They're screwing that up for us. 
[00:18:00]  Oh, and you put in something like, I don't know, blonde hookers, and it says, Amazon.com,  would you like to purchase blonde hookers?  Something that couldn't possibly just be at Amazon.  Right, right.  Yeah.  The Apollo 13 mission.  Would you like to purchase the Apollo 13 mission?  I don't think I can.  Really don't think that's feasible, possible.  No. 
[00:18:30]  That dude from NSYNC already tried it.  Yeah, it didn't work.  Hey, we're going to take our first break.  We're going to get on schedule today, hopefully.  Steve Lynch coming in.  Who else is coming in today?  I don't have the list in front of me yet.  Maybe that's it.  The Tony Award nominated.  Right.  Steven Lynch.  Oh, we also have.  Broadway star.  Director Davis Guggenheim.  Guggenheim?  From the.  What movie?  Does he have a museum?  What movie?  Why would we know what movie? 
[00:19:00]  Why would we know that?  Ben?  Al Gore movie.  Oh, that Al Gore.  Oh, we'll have to get Steve in here.  I watched the movie.  I'm so glad I have a hybrid vehicle now.  And I'm thinking of getting another one.  Is Steve over here?  Why are you against the environment?  Steve.  I'm not against the environment.  I'm against the BS that comes out of some people about the environment.  Or the importance or lack thereof of the environment and global warming and things that are happening. 
[00:19:30]  It's just the way it is.  Have you.  Look at the earth.  It constantly changes.  Whether we're here or not.  It just changes.  And a lot of the change is based on the life that inhabits this planet.  Whether it's dinosaurs or mammoths or early man.  What they do on this planet affects it somehow.  And the planet then changes, adapts, gets rid of some species.  Whatever it is.  We're just another one.  We happen to have a little more of a divine spark in our heads so we can pull dirt out of the ground and make things that fly. 
[00:20:00]  Which is pretty amazing if you think about it.  And because of that divine spark, we're able to ruin the earth a lot faster than any other species.  It doesn't mean it's wrong.  It doesn't mean it's wrong.  And we're not.  Who says we're ruining it?  Who says changing it is wrecking it?  Why does it have to remain like it was 10,000 years ago?  Why does it have to be?  I don't want to worry about getting a sunburn in January in New York City. 
[00:20:30]  That's why.  People got sunburns all the time.  That's why.  Basically, if you're concerned about the continual survival of people, then it would bug you.  But if you don't have a problem with dinosaurs were around and then they're not, we're around.  Do you know how long dinosaurs are around, too?  Yeah, but they weren't there.  Millions upon millions.  It was their time.  Get off already.  And we've been around for a while.  Not that long.  Compared to the dinosaurs, not much at all.  Unless there's some cataclysmic event like a meteor that wipes out all the life on the planet, we'll be here for a long time. 
[00:21:00]  We'll figure it out.  We run out of fossil fuel.  Oh, my God.  We're going to put on loincloths and run around?  Believe me.  We'll figure something else out.  Steve, we'll figure it out.  It's just a way.  That's how we're the laziest things on this planet.  That's what happens.  We wait until we need something.  Global warming.  It's like a global term paper.  Like, what does this thing do?  Yeah.  You've got to have this done by 2011. 
[00:21:30]  All right.  I'll wait.  Yeah, these next four years, it's like a weekend.  Global warming.  Do you honestly believe that the polar ice caps are going to melt enough where they show Florida is a little nub sticking up?  Just stop it.  It is not going to happen.  Oh, it's going to happen.  This is going to be the audio.  Maybe thousands upon thousands of years.  When Earth takes its normal course of changing because this planet changes.  You look at the original. 
[00:22:00]  It really sounds like he should have a lab coat on right now.  I have a microphone in front of me.  That's all I need.  Don't you know what that means?  That means you're an expert.  We have come to the conclusion that as long as you have a mic in front of you and you're broadcasting to more than just one person, you're an expert.  No matter what's coming out of your mouth.  This is the audio that's going to play as the water rises and all you hear is...  But if you're on TV, you need a microphone and a podium.  And a podium.  And a podium.  To lean on.  Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for inviting me.  Now you got into some.  Now the phones are crazy.  Good.  Bring it.  We have to take a break so we can go to it next, okay? 
[00:22:30]  Uh, Rasheed, real fast.  Hey, I wanted to call out Billy Burr.  Yesterday he went with a Rachel Ray reference and he tried it again today and nobody even noticed.  Uh-oh.  Two days in a row.  What was it?  The Rachel Ray?  Yeah.  I think it's funny.  I figured there's somebody out there who watches the Food Network.  I'm not just playing to these two people.  Rasheed's calling you out for two bombs in two days.  Same one.  That's hilarious.  What a bastard.  These guys are asses, man.  They pay way too close attention. 
[00:23:00]  Hey, Jim in Washington, what's up?  Earth's days are numbered.  Yeah, Anthony, what about Stephen Hawking saying that the Earth's days are numbered?  Earth's days are numbered.  I didn't tell you that that number was 8,623,000.  That's still, you know, plenty of days.  Dude, the dinosaurs didn't put a hole in the ozone layer, though.  You know what I mean?  They were just kind of walking around eating leaves with each other. 
[00:23:30]  And by the way, they are.  What do you think fossil fuels made up, my friend?  Dinosaurs.  It's all their fault.  No, but it was in the ground.  And we took it out.  And we had the gumption to pull it out of the ground and make something that makes cars run.  They were plotting against us millions of years ago, and we didn't even know it.  Instead of saying how bad everything we do is, why not look at how we can take rocks and things from trees and things out of the air and put them together and make something that flies? 
[00:24:00]  We're amazing.  We're amazing.  We're an amazing species.  So what?  A couple of spotted owls have to pay the ultimate price.  You ever heard a frog with this kind of arrogance?  Exactly.  This is why we already have enough statues of ourselves.  We've carved our faces in the sides of mountains.  We're wonderful.  We are the most amazing thing on this planet.  We're not.  We've ever seen.  We're locust.  We've been to the moon with stuff we built that was just sitting in the ground. 
[00:24:30]  Rocks.  Who's we?  Rocks.  We.  A few guys.  A few guys have been to the moon.  Humans.  They don't allow us to go to the moon.  Hey, we're locusts.  We're gypsy moth caterpillars.  We can continue this rant after the break.  All right.  After the break, you guys are going to kill the show if we go way too long here.

[00:26:30]  The Opie and Anthony Traveling Virus.  Tickets go on sale this morning at 9 a.m.  Through Ticketmaster outlets all over the ball field.  Three dates.  Worcester, Jersey at the PNC Bank Art Center and the Tweeter Center across the river there in Philly.  In Camden, New Jersey.  That's September 9th.  Tickets on sale at 9 a.m.  They're going to go pretty fast, I do believe.  That sleepy little town, Camden.  Oh, nice little bus pic video of a kid getting the crap beat out of him. 
[00:27:00]  Obviously, some black kid beating up some little white kid on a school bus.  Now, Anthony, let's not go there.  Well, sorry.  Look at how little that white kid is.  That's sad.  That guy should be dissed by his peeps for beating up such a little white kid.  Ah, that little white kid, he deserved it.  Probably said something mildly racist to him.  Probably.  I just got to try to balance it off on the show, you know? 
[00:27:30]  Hey, uh, I like that as you.  Thank you.  I'm distracted.  Dan Yeo from New Hampshire, explain.  It says, where to, Opie?  I'll ask if Ant won't.  Where to?  I hate when people write dumb stuff on the internet.  What does that mean?  That makes sense.  What?  You just announced something during the break that you probably heard on PalTalk.  Announced what?  That you were going away the long...  Oh.  Oh, yeah.  I forget that we have the PalTalk cameras on.  Oh.  Well, still, be more specific. 
[00:28:00]  All right.  I'm sorry, Dan Yeo.  I forgot that Anthony had the audio up.  Because we have PalTalk cameras in the studio.  So when we go to break, you kind of get to watch us just kind of hanging out and talking.  Talking, saying stuff behind the scenes.  Trashing people.  Yeah.  And all that fun stuff.  Whatever else.  All right.  So now that makes sense.  And I apologize to Dan Yeo.  Yeah, I'm going away for the long Fourth of July weekend.  Man, I'm getting the hell out of here.  Yarr.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Steve's in studio.  I guess E-Rock was saying that through the instant message system, whatever, that Steve 
[00:28:30]  was losing his mind when Anthony was talking about the environment and that Earth's days  are not numbered.  Yeah, he was saying...  Hold on, hold on, hold on.  Steve's very passionate about this.  I'm not very passionate, but...  There's nothing wrong with being passionate, Steve.  Hold on, hold on.  I'll back you on this one.  E-Rock, he was saying that...  He was getting aggravated, Anthony, saying that New York City was going to be underwater.  And Jesus, Anthony, you don't know what you're talking about.  You watch too many movies.  No, I don't watch too many movies.  I'm not basing this on the Day After Tomorrow scenario.  You're basing it on the Al Gore movie? 
[00:29:00]  Yes, entirely.  Oh, Jesus.  I form all of my opinions on Al Gore documentaries.  Al Gore.  No, I just...  Ant, you're such a smart guy.  And when you start...  Thank you, Stephen.  And when you say things that are so completely contrary to what...  To what's happening?  To what's happening.  Mm-hmm.  It infuriates me because it makes...  Somehow I think you're doing it because you know it's going to get a rise out of people.  No.  No, not at all.  I'll tell you what it is.  Anthony has a different perspective on everything.  He doesn't give a crap what happens to this Earth after he's gone. 
[00:29:30]  He's one of those guys.  But it's not after.  It's not after you're gone.  He doesn't really care.  It's not after you're gone.  It's happening.  Do you honestly believe...  Let me tell you something.  Do you honestly believe if the ocean's levels and water levels on this globe rose to a point  where...  I'm not even talking about where they said the final point was where...  I saw a clip of Florida and it's pretty much gone.  It's a little nub sticking off the...  That's their projection.  Not even talking about that.  I'm talking about if it rose to a point where people went like, 
[00:30:00]  Wow, this...  Hey, excuse me, Mr. President.  The water's really rising.  Problem is, it's not going to happen immediately.  And that's the point that this movie, An Inconvenient Truth, makes.  It doesn't happen immediately.  No.  It happens over the course of 50 years.  Evolution doesn't happen immediately.  This planet doesn't change immediately.  It takes thousands of years, but it constantly changes.  And that's what this planet is a living kind of thing. 
[00:30:30]  And the vast majority of the populations of this planet live in coastal regions.  When all of a sudden you start filling those coastal regions up with water,  you're going to have people that...  You're going to have a lot of displaced human beings that are...  I know, but...  No, no, they're going to...  You know, but there's another thing happening.  I see Anthony's point now.  This stuff will happen at such a slow pace that these people will be slowly moving out of these areas and going elsewhere.  Hey, Steve, do you understand that there were...  If you lost Florida a week from today, wow, that would be a really big deal. 
[00:31:00]  However, in addition to that...  Matter of fact, New Orleans went under and it wasn't even a big deal in the end.  But imagine...  I mean, and people are like, oh my God, how can you say that?  But look around, man.  Look at the big picture.  Look at the big picture.  Look around.  They've got a Mardi Gras happening already.  They relived located at Houston.  But imagine if hurricanes like Katrina started happening more frequently  and all of a sudden more cities started getting hit with those kind of hurricanes.  Then you've got more cities than just New Orleans.  Do you honestly...  And you honestly believe that because we're doing what? 
[00:31:30]  Nothing.  That we're making...  No, no, we're obviously doing something bad.  Yes.  Something bad.  Well, these people will just...  That is making hurricanes stronger.  How are we making hurricanes stronger?  I'll tell you exactly why.  All right.  One piece is the way that heat from the sun hits the atmosphere historically.  It comes through the atmosphere, hits the planet, hits the oceans, hits the glaciers.  And most of that heat usually goes back up into space.  What's happening with the burning of fossil fuels and pollution is it's thickening up the atmosphere. 
[00:32:00]  And that heat, less of that heat is going back up into outer space and it's going back into the earth.  And it's melting glaciers.  It's melting snow on mountaintops.  And all that water is causing the glaciers to melt, is causing...  You do know the whole planet was...  Well, not the whole planet, but a lot of the northern and southern hemisphere covered with ice.  Really, just about 10,000, 15,000 years ago. 
[00:32:30]  Relatively short amount of time, relatively short amount of time in human existence.  And what happened to those glaciers?  They pulled back.  Why?  Oongugu's campfire was throwing off a little too much smoke?  The rate at which the climate of this planet is rising has happened so much faster over the last 20 years.  Has it?  Yeah.  I heard Al Gore say that the 10 hottest years so far in history have happened in the last 12 years. 
[00:33:00]  Sure, that's one of the points he makes.  Doesn't maybe that just happened?  No.  Don't you think more...  No, it's just a coincidence.  Doesn't it just...  It's a direct result of human interference.  I like the whole philosophy, too, that as the water's coming up, like, oh, excuse me, the water's starting to come in, we need to do something, all the oil companies will just be like, yeah, okay, to hell with those billions of dollars.  Thank you.  Let's switch this on Monday.  Yeah, as the mediator, I can't go with your point.  Look, I can't.  Thank you.  The odds of that would be ridiculous.  I think his nonchalant attitude is irresponsible. 
[00:33:30]  I think it's that...  How long have we been...  I think it's arrogant to think that we've been keeping weather records for how long, really?  Very long time.  That's the point I would have went with.  Relatively very short period of time that we've been keeping accurate temperature with.  I want to know what the weather stats were for the year three.  Really?  Give me the year three.  I bet there were 20 years in a row that were hot.  You know what he's like?  You know who he is?  He's the guy going right before the Titanic leaves.  Not even God could sink her. 
[00:34:00]  Exactly.  Shut off, matey!  Now he's got me killing people on a ship.  Nonchalant arrogance.  Could you at least make me the cigarette guy?  He sits there and goes, you know, the medical community is really chastising us.  And why do they want you to stop smoking?  It's all about politics.  No.  It's good for you.  I'm saying this...  Smoking relaxes you.  This issue...  How did they explain then that in the beginning of the industrial age, when every state in this fine union and a lot of countries in Europe were just pumping out coal, everything ran on coal, we had more pollution over this country, especially, back in the 20s and 30s than we do right now. 
[00:34:30]  I think...  I'm actually trying to remember, because they do address that, but one of the things they do...  Of course they do.  You can drill into glacier ice much in the same way that you would drill into a redwood tree to track chemicals in history to see how old the thing is. 
[00:35:00]  And they can check the amount of CO2 levels that were in the atmosphere 100 years ago.  Right.  And they can...  Take a nice little core sample.  Exactly.  And they can look and see, look, it was rising at this incremental level over this period of five years to this period of five years to this period of five years.  All of a sudden, you hit the last century, and it rises drastically.  Yeah.  And it's a direct result of human intervention.  I'll agree.  And scientists aren't refuting this.  I'll agree with that also.  You'd have to be stupid to think that all of a sudden, this new thing we're doing, burning fossil fuel, coal, powering things, nuclear energy, whatever it is, is going to somehow affect the environment. 
[00:35:30]  I'm saying, how bad is it, really, that we changed?  I think the fact that New Orleans was underwater last year...  That was a big hurricane that hit New Orleans.  Don't blame it on everything we're doing.  It could have just been a big hurricane that hit New Orleans.  Ocean temperatures rise.  And you've talked about this before. 
[00:36:00]  The water's too cold up here for there to be a hurricane.  But the water is warming up in southern parts of the southern hemisphere.  For a few years, and then all of a sudden, it'll cool down.  It's called an ice age.  Three quarters in steel, matey.  Damn the torpedoes.  More of these violent storms because the ocean's getting warmer.  Life on this planet...  My point is, life on this planet has constantly changed the planet.  Sure.  Before we were even here, it changed it. 
[00:36:30]  And it will continue to do that.  Because we are the smartest thing so far that we know of that has been on this planet...  Allegedly.  Allegedly, of course.  Things are changing.  Yeah.  We're very...  We can adapt.  The planet itself...  I love when people say, we've got to save Earth.  Believe me, this planet will be here for a long time after even we're gone.  What's the Carlin line?  The planet will just shake us off like a kid's of bad fleas? 
[00:37:00]  Yeah.  It's like a wet dog.  Just get off.  And then something else comes here.  All the buildings we see out this lovely window.  Gone.  Some Planet of the Apes scenario where it's just piles of vine-covered dirt after a while.  That's fine by me.  It's just the way things work.  Oh, see, now I get it.  He doesn't care.  No.  He doesn't.  Fine.  Okay.  That's what I was saying earlier.  Because there's nothing to care about.  First, I actually thought he was saying it's not happening.  But now I realize he's saying he just doesn't care. 
[00:37:30]  And by the way, what's your point?  He just doesn't care.  What's your position here, people?  Are we running out of oil?  Or are we going to use it until we burn up the ozone layer?  What's going to happen first?  If we run out of oil, hey, problem solved.  Problem solved.  There's no more fossil fuel being burnt.  We can't screw up the atmosphere.  Everything goes back to normal.  If we don't run out of oil, hey, great.  We don't want to run out of oil.  But so many things are dependent on fossil fuels for their production.  But if we're going to run out.  Yeah.  And then what happens to the environment?  It goes back to being cool again. 
[00:38:00]  I think by the time the oil company starts.  One problem or the other.  What's the big issue?  What's the biggest issue?  Running out of fossil fuel or the fossil fuel affecting the environment?  He's saying both are a big problem.  But only one can last long enough to affect us.  Whatever is least financially destructive to the companies that are actually.  Drill Alaska dry.  That's what I say.  Horrific.  You ever been there?  Hey, hey, hey.  Have I ever been there?  I am a road hat, sir. 
[00:38:30]  I have been there.  You've played the Gnome Ha Ha's?  It's like choo-choo Charlie's.  The Shuckle Hut in Anchorage?  Yeah.  Just dial 1-800-555.  Brr.  Well, this is going to get interesting because the director of Al Gore's movie is calling the show later today.  Bring him.  Davis Guggenheim.  Bring him.  Guggenheim.  Been to the museum.  I didn't see one dinosaur bone.  This is what I'm saying.  By the way, Steve.  He won't even be open to this guy.  He's already like, I got my truck latte.  I have a big SUV.  I can put it in four-wheel drive. 
[00:39:00]  You can't get a bigger SUV than I have.  I love it.  And you know who I drive in it?  Me.  You know, he's in the summer blockbuster disaster movie.  He's that guy who creates the monster and then it turns on him like, I made you.  I made you.  Exactly.  By the way, Steve drives a hybrid as you drive your bike.  Yes, he does.  I certainly do.  And I'm going to buy another one.  Let me ask you something about those because I think those things are BS.  BS, is it true that they only don't run on gas or oil when you're not moving? 
[00:39:30]  No, not true.  That isn't true.  At slower speeds, you can go completely electric, yeah.  Really?  How low?  It's electric.  Like city driving, like in the Toyota I have, you can go like 20 miles an hour and you're  not using any gas.  I mean, it's when you hit the highway that you basically, you get up to speed and then  you're using your electric motor to coast.  Those things are such a scam.  Here's some audio of Steve driving in his hybrid. 
[00:40:00]  Put her down, put her down, Steve.  And look, now it turned into a suitcase and he carries it into his house.  I back you, Steve.  Uh-oh, I think you're on the right road.  We got a physicist on the line, Jerome from Boston.  Jerome, let's go.  What's up?  What's up, fellas?  Hey, this is a physicist?  What's up?  100%.  Thank you, sir.  Yes.  Wait, are you the guy that is a physicist but it's from like a community college?  Exactly.  Did you hear him? 
[00:40:30]  He's not even a...  No, I'm not even kidding.  There's a physicist that calls us but he got his degree from a community college.  Sir, can we have your credentials?  It's not a community college.  What was it?  Who knows?  It's Curry and Milton.  Yeah, you've called the show before, right?  Yes.  Yeah.  Yeah, this is a...  I love this guy.  Curry and Milton, that's right down the street from me.  That's from people who don't study in high school.  Oh, and what college did you go to, Billy Burr?  I'm not saying I'm a physicist.  All right, enough.  I'm not a physicist.  I went to Emerson College.  Wait.  Better school than Curry.  This guy is not...  It is?  This guy is supporting you.  I don't know.  I didn't graduate high school. 
[00:41:00]  What do I know?  He got his degree going to the 13th grade.  13th grade degree?  I don't care.  He's a physicist.  13th grade, he gets a physicist degree there.  He's a physicist and he agrees.  This guy, I'm a brain surgeon.  Brain surgeon, you're on line one.  What's up, guys?  Steve's just mad because he does 40 on the on-ramp to the expressway and gets passed by everything.  No, I don't.  And his foot is to the floor.  I do not.  My hybrid...  I can't...  I can't get on the expressway. 
[00:41:30]  Here's him in the morning when the sun isn't up, charging his solar panels.  How many vinegar I can put in the gas tank?  I think that works.  If I could get solar panels put on my house, I would, but I just...  Solar panels.  It's great.  If you read about this stuff, you get all your power from the sun, obviously, but it goes back into the grid. 
[00:42:00]  I got solar panels.  You sell it back to the power company.  You sell it back to the power company.  Yep.  Steve, you're totally making sense to me.  Thank you, Billy.  100%.  Of course he is.  Is it true you're building a windmill above your condo?  Oh, I love it.  I got a windmill, man.  I love you save the world schmucks.  I can't get enough of you save the world idiots.  Look, I'm not...  As opposed to what?  You morons in your SUVs with your guns?  Hey, we know what's right.  Where did guns come in?  You have guns.  You have guns. 
[00:42:30]  When the floods come, I'm going to need them.  You have guns.  I'm going to have to shoot people that are rushing for my dry land.  Well, that's the point.  That's the point.  So what was your point?  Where did the guns come from?  You're home, you jackass.  Exactly.  What do guns have to do with this conversation?  Where did guns come into this?  He actually gets around.  Don't you make me bring guns into this conversation, my friend, because you're going to lose.  You'll be at the losing end of that argument.  We're talking about pollution.  He's got to bring my guns.  I'm going to tell you right now why our side will lose is because this side, Mike makes 
[00:43:00]  right, maniac like him.  We are armed.  He, I swear to God, is two days without food from just taking the AK to his neighbors.  AK.  It's an AR-15, my friend, American-made weapons.  I don't go for that commie crap.  Steve, you done or what?  Guns.  All right, Steve's done.  We're going to take a break.  Thank you, Steve.  Once again, let's not forget the Opie and Anthony Traveling Virus, the comedy event of 2006,  coming soon to a venue near you. 
[00:43:30]  We're playing Worcester, the PNC Bank Art Center in Jersey, and September 9th, the Tweeter  Center across the river in Philly there in Camden, New Jersey.  Tickets go on sale this morning at 9 a.m. through all Ticketmaster locations.  Check out the lineups by going to our MySpace account.  It's by the river?  Oh, jeez, I hope it's still there by the time we do the gig.  Bring your life jackets, people.  Anthony's going to be there dumping antifreeze in it.  See, look, it's doing nothing.  There's plenty of fish.  There's plenty of fish. 
[00:44:00]  I like how Bill went, Steve, you're 100% right.  Yeah, I'm going to do it.  Based on nothing, he's given him 100, not even 99%.  I have a microphone, too, sir.  I have a microphone, because you just get totally trashed.  You got the sound effects.  You completely get trashed.  Somebody has to come to his defense.  Thank you, Bill.  100%, at least 99% of him.  He's given me not 1%.  Not 1% you're giving me.  Because he has on a mash windbreaker with horizontal strength. 
[00:44:30]  I can't even listen to this guy.  It's his dirty baseball hat.  Let me tell you about the world.  What did you base this on?  A movie you saw made by scientists?  Let me tell you something, buddy.  I have a PlayStation and an Xbox.  I know about the atmosphere.  I never heard of this Professor Al Gore scientist.  He's the fucking...  Oops.  Yeah!  Potty mouth.  He's...  He's the spokesperson.  Yeah, he's just a spokesperson giving a lecture. 
[00:45:00]  He's just presenting scientific evidence.  He'll be a scientist coming here.  He's a jokes person.  He's what I call a jokes person.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  All right, listen.  We got it, Brian.  At least I can carry on a mature conversation without cursing.  Oh, really?  Captain XM?  Potty mouth?  Been fired 18 times?  Before 9 o'clock.  All right.  The director will be calling in later today, Davis Guggenheim.  That's going to be a very interesting phone call.  The director of Al Gore's environmental... 
[00:45:30]  Bring him.  And once again, don't forget, the Opie and Anthony traveling virus.  It's a comedy event of 2006.  We got all the comedians you know and love from this program, including Bill Burr, of  course, Jim Norton, who will be back on the radio with us on Monday, and everybody else.  Bob Kelly, Voss, Patrice O'Neill, you name them.  Go to the radio station's website that you're listening to us.  I've never had such a passionate argument before 7 a.m.  Oh, I know, and you shouldn't.  That's great.  Tickets go on sale this morning, 9 a.m. through all Ticketmaster locations. 
[00:46:00]  We'll continue in just a bit.  It's the Opie and Anthony dance party weekend.  Wait, wait, wait, wait, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.  The Opie and Anthony show.  Comedy gone too far.  The Opie and Anthony show.  This is the Opie and Anthony show. 
[00:46:30]  The ONA virus spreading across America.  Lots of instant feedback coming in today.  If you got something for the show, 1-866-313-FREE.  Bill Burr sitting in, doing a great job.  You know how Derek is back at the XM Studios typing in what is called pad data?  It gives a brief description and a couple of words of what we're talking about.  For the XM radio.  Yeah.  When we were talking about the ostrich, O-S-T-R-I-D-G-E. 
[00:47:00]  No way.  Ostrich.  No way.  O-S-T-R-I-C-H.  Yeah.  Ostrich.  Derek, the ostrich family.  Is a dope.  Wow.  We finally got something on him because we thought he was perfect.  I thought he was like the smartest guy in that room.  It turns out he's a blithering idiot.  Here I am mocking him.  I don't know how to say it.  T-R-I-C-H?  Yeah.  Ostrich.  Ostrich.  Ostrich.  Ostrich.  Ostrich.  Yes.  Like Rich.  Yes.  Hey.  Like Rich, except it's a bird being raped. 
[00:47:30]  Right.  Exactly.  By the way, Mr. 455 picked me up this morning.  Hiya.  He's at my door and he goes, be careful today.  There's a homeless guy sleeping outside your place.  Right, Kenny?  Just today.  Lily.  No, I'll explain in a second here.  But you pulled up and what did you see?  Yes, sir.  Somebody must have threw out a couch like right in front of your front door there.  That was the first thing I noticed. 
[00:48:00]  And then I saw the nice Nubian gentleman sprawled out on the couch.  Yeah.  To the people of New York, I guess someone moved out of my brownstone.  So all their stuff that they don't want anymore is waiting on the curb to be taken away, right?  When you leave a couch outside your place, you're pretty much setting up shop for a homeless guy in New York City.  That's like a homeless guy's luxury apartment.  These guys, that's all they do is walk the streets, figure out where they're going to sleep. 
[00:48:30]  And so they see a couch.  Yeah.  This is like MTV Cribs.  This is like a four-star hotel to a homeless guy.  He's like, you've got to be kidding me.  They sleep on the sidewalk, on the subway grates, just on a blanket on the ground.  A couch?  Like I was commenting yesterday.  These walls are a ceiling.  In June?  I do a lot of inline skating.  And you've got to sit, you know, after the show, you've got to sit down somewhere and put on your skates, right? 
[00:49:00]  You can't sit anywhere in New York anymore because they're making sure homeless people don't sleep on flat surfaces.  They put spikes here in New York on every flat surface.  Every flat surface in New York has spikes.  It's a little side of the building where it would be a nice little, you know, sit down real fast.  Maybe, you know, do your cigarette break or, in my case, throw on my rollerblades.  Big wrought iron spike.  Dude, I used to say rollerblades, but...  Inline skating.  No, I used to say rollerblades and then all the guys, you know, that's a brand.  That's a brand. 
[00:49:30]  Is that an angry typing guy?  That's a brand.  It's called inline skating.  Dude, in case you didn't know.  You know, you're right, Bill.  It's rollerblades.  I'm going back to saying rollerblades.  That's old school.  But I would get emails.  Rollerblades is a brand.  It's called inline skating, ass.  It's nowhere for me to sit and tighten my skates with my skate key.  But the reason for this is because the homeless people, they're just walking the streets looking where they're going to sleep. 
[00:50:00]  So if you throw a couch out like this idiot in my building, now the homeless people are camping out until they take the couch away.  Now they can be comfortable.  Those bastards.  Not in front of his house.  Not only did this guy get a couch to sleep in, he also had a really nice comforter that someone threw away.  So he's all bundled up nice.  He took his shoes off and everything.  Why?  You should have just given him your bed and you take the couch.  Took his shoes off.  You know, before we learned this in our building, there was a hose out front because some people have decided they need to grow herbs in the two-by-two dirt area outside our building. 
[00:50:30]  You city dwellers are hysterical with their growing of greens.  So, yeah.  So they're like, wow.  Window boxes.  A perfect place to grow herbs.  So we have a hose out front and someone had the actual nozzle on the hose.  That was a bad idea because the homeless people, you know, realized they could shower right outside my bedroom window.  Oh, so they would use that little spigot?  Well, first they were using the actual hose because the hose was still connected. 
[00:51:00]  And then they got the bright idea, okay, you take the hose away and the homeless people won't shower anymore.  No, they just reached their head down in between the nozzle and the concrete.  It can't be more than eight inches of room.  And they'll stick their head in that way and shower that way.  But now, finally, they took the handle off so you can't turn the water on anymore.  Unless you have vice grips.  And now they're going to smell.  And that's why they smell so much, like Tippy Tom.  But to the people in New York, really, when you throw out a couch or a mattress, you're just setting up shop for a homeless person outside your joint. 
[00:51:30]  And you don't care, but it's in front of your place.  Honestly, I don't really care.  No?  Nah.  I just walked by and it gave me something to look at this morning.  The cops don't route them.  It looks like a homeless Ikea.  Right.  What are those little living rooms sets that they set up?  This guy was loving life.  It made me laugh, actually.  We walked by and we were just laughing. 
[00:52:00]  I'm like, this guy is out cold.  Is he the tough guy on the block?  He's in dreamland.  Because you would think only the tough guy.  Like, they've got to fight over it.  They've got to fight over that couch.  If you're drunk at nights, I would have grabbed the sofa on the sidewalk just to be like, ah, I've got to go to sleep.  I can't walk anymore.  You know, though, that, like, some guy got woken up with just a punch to the face.  Get off of my couch.  But I'm, oh.  Oh, that's right.  Just step up and punch him in the face as he's sleeping.  Yeah, that's not the nice mother shaking you awake. 
[00:52:30]  Go to school.  It's time for school.  You want some French toast?  Just some big meat fist hitting you in the side of the head, throwing you off of now his couch.  It's a jungle out there.  Beating you with your bag of mismatched sneakers.  This guy was in dreamland, though.  So I hope they take the garbage away today.  Is today garbage day in New York?  I don't know.  I don't know.  The cops used to rouse them more than they do now. 
[00:53:00]  There's always one that always ends up in a garbage truck.  Is that what it is?  They just pick up the sofa?  That's where that joke came from.  What joke?  Throwing away a perfectly good, you know, guy.  Of course the cop is laughing extra hard.  Oh, yeah.  Of course the cop laughs extra hard.  And he's heard that joke a few times.  It's in its original form, right, Kenny?  Wink, wink, huh?  Yeah, yeah.  Look at him.  Yeah, yeah. 
[00:53:30]  Kenny wrote that one.  You know, it was funny.  When we came out and we, like, slammed the front door to make sure it was shut and locked,  the guy got, like, jostled and went, like, and, like, rolled over a little bit.  He was annoyed that you were interrupting his sleep.  Yeah, this guy was going to work at four in the morning.  He's pissed.  Yeah, this guy was in heaven, man.  No sympathy.  I'm telling you, a four-star hotel for the homeless guy this morning.  So, good for him.  Oh, I just figured out that joke.  Yeah, yeah.  It's a classic.  It doesn't always have to go the Klan route. 
[00:54:00]  It's a classic.  I didn't say anything.  Never even said the punchline.  What you do is you cast.  You're like a racist, like, fly fisherman.  You just sort of cast it out there so you don't say it.  The only people that understand what I just said are people that know the punchline and  are racists.  Okay, look.  I'll fix everything.  There you go.  There you go.  That's the inappropriate bell.  Whenever anything inappropriate is said, we acknowledge it's inappropriate by doing that, 
[00:54:30]  and it makes it all better.  By the way, speaking of the homeless, we did homeless radio again on the second half of  the Opie and Anthony show.  Yeah.  We get to fool around a lot when we do our XM show, exclusive XM show.  And when we decide to do a little bonus radio, sometimes we do some dumb things.  And the other day we had Tippi Tom doing homeless radio.  We just give him a mic.  We give him fan just to kind of keep the show going.  So it's Tippi Tom and his friend Blue this time around, and they just sit where we sit, 
[00:55:00]  and Than kind of runs the show and kind of directs the ship a little bit.  And takes calls.  It's a real caller-oriented political talk show.  They could talk about the issues of the day.  They ask them questions about Iraq and Iran and let these guys just rip.  And before we got fired, we had this concept going, we're like, if some radio station would  put a homeless guy on every morning or every afternoon, I would have to listen every day. 
[00:55:30]  I don't care what they were saying.  And just let them take calls about whatever's going on in the world and see what their point  of view is.  And there's no radio programmers out there brave enough to try that.  Because they're not very, they don't have enough information, up-to-date information to  really say what's going on.  But they have just a little of what they think is going on.  Radio programmers are brave enough to try David Lee Roth, but they're not brave enough  to really, really go for it with a homeless guy doing radio. 
[00:56:00]  So, Tippi Tom, this is Homeless Radio Volume 2.  A little taste of what we got to hear the other day.  It's Tippi Tom and Blue.  I guess there was some controversy with KFC.  A lot of people, Than, you know this story?  Yeah, Than's coming in.  There was a big story earlier this week about KFC.  Every so often that pops up.  Yeah, the story's basically they're being sued about the amount of trans fats in their  chicken.  Ah, this one comes up, yeah, every so often. 
[00:56:30]  Apparently trans...  People can't put the goddamn chicken leg down.  Trans fats kill 30,000 people a year or something.  And why is this KFC's fault?  It's the highest amount.  It's the fast food chain with the highest amount of trans fat.  The news story said something like, one three-piece KFC bucket has the same trans fat as 30 McDonald's  cheeseburgers.  Wow.  But it's good stuff.  Are there people really out there thinking that they're eating healthy when they go to 
[00:57:00]  KFC?  It's healthy when you go to KFC, yeah.  That's one of those things where you just...  That used to be my hangover food, KFC.  You know what's the way I think about KFC food is?  If I eat it when it's hot, the second I'm done eating it, I feel like I'm going to die.  But you put that in the refrigerator and you eat it cold.  I don't know if the refrigeration kills some of the trans fats or gets them to a nice cool  level.  Yeah.  Do you eat the skin too when it's cold?  Oh, that's the best part.  When it's hot it is, not when it's cold. 
[00:57:30]  See, I'm the opposite of you again.  I know, right?  I like the environment.  I don't dislike black people.  I'm crazy.  I'm crazy like that.  I'm just...  I mean, I don't even know how I'd fit in on this show.  I give people a chance.  I'm happy the homeless guy got a couch.  I mean, I don't know.  You're right.  You're making me feel like a hippie over here.  What the hell are you doing here?  You're right.  It's my childhood anger.  That's what keeps me...  I didn't really mind the homeless guy on the couch.  It was just an observation that the homeless guy...  Wait, I'll be trying to get in. 
[00:58:00]  Hey, I didn't mind.  I didn't mind the guy.  Some guy that sleeps on the couch with some of my best friends.  I just thought it was...  I just looked at the humor angle, actually.  That's, you know...  Yeah, I'm sure he finds a lot of humor in it.  You throw this stuff out and they migrate right to it.  Stupid me, I thought if you threw a couch out, no one would touch it.  No, they turn it right side up and they set up a little hotel room for themselves.  You get mice.  So, the KFC thing.  Yeah, so I brought this up to Tom and Blue and they reacted very strongly. 
[00:58:30]  Apparently, they're big fans.  Yeah, the key was set up the story again because this is really funny because he misunderstood  you, obviously.  Oh.  The trans fat.  Yeah, I said they were being sued for too much fat in their chicken and Tom thought I said  something else.  Yeah, and here it is.  A little taste of homeless radio with Tippi Tom.  Dan from Rhode Island, you got a question for Tippi Tom and Blue?  Yeah, I got a question for Golden Bunny.  Hold on, hold on.  That was the wrong one. 
[00:59:00]  That's about global warming, which is good, too.  Well, of course.  We'll do that one next, but I'm sure he'll bring up Bill's point.  Exactly.  Here's the KFC thing.  He'd be 100% right.  Some other stuff we got going on in the news.  Kentucky Fried Chicken's getting sued for being too fat.  Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.  Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.  Whoa, why, why?  We can't have secret in the suit?  For what?  People are saying there's too much trans fat in their foods and that kills too many people 
[00:59:30]  with the fat in the foods.  Well, we got to put some less than a short in it and all in it.  Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.  He said put too much cat in the chicken?  Too much fat, Tom.  Too much cat?  That should bring me up there now.  I'm just thinking this.  I'm eating cat?  Tom?  Well, I'm thinking I'm eating chicken? 
[01:00:00]  Tom?  No.  Do you think the company should stop selling fat chicken or people should stop buying fat  chicken?  What do you think?  The company should stop selling cat chicken and I'm sick of it.  All right.  No more cat chicken.  I am sick of it.  I want some something different.  Put some turkey in that chicken.  No more cat in the chicken. 
[01:00:30]  Who wouldn't listen to this every day?  Put some turkey in that chicken.  I want any more cat chicken.  I like how he runs out of air.  Yeah.  I don't want no cat in my chicken.  We run out of air, too.  Any room he's in runs out of air.  Wow.  What a wreck.  What an aroma. 
[01:01:00]  Steven from Bayshore.  Timmy Tom can't find a home or a coherent thought.  Beautiful.  I like how because you had covered a bunch of subjects that were really hard hitting and  very relevant to what's going on today.  But that was the one where it's like Kentucky Fried Chicken.  Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.  Whoa, whoa.  Whoa.  Hey, oh.  They didn't react that strongly to the issue of homelessness.  Well, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. 
[01:01:30]  Tippy Tom.  I want no cat, Fried Chicken.  Tippy Tom with his sidekick, Blue.  Homeless radio.  Here's what he has to say about global warming.  A little taste of homeless radio.  Dan from Rhode Island.  You got a question for Tippy Tom and Blue.  Yeah, I got a question for old Golden Buns.  Hey, Tom, what do you think about global warming?  Golden Buns.  What do you think about the global warming issue and how should we solve it?  Well, I believe in heat. 
[01:02:00]  I like warm.  So global warming is good.  Yeah, if you sleep outside.  Blue, your thoughts, global warming?  I'm going to warm.  Yeah.  I want more heat.  I get cold.  Cold.  I get cold.  I get cold.  You hear that, Al Gore?  I need heat, and I don't want cat in my chicken.  If he's sober enough, he could probably be a good jazz singer. 
[01:02:30]  Oh, yeah?  With that voice?  Oh, no.  We gooby-booby-bobbity-boob.  Yeah, cat singer.  Cat singer.  I don't want to be no cat singer, boo.  I don't need no cat in my music.  Put some turkey in that singer.  Oh, he is too much, man.  We heard him sobered up once.  Sober?  Whoa, whoa, whoa.  Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.  Remember he sounded completely different? 
[01:03:00]  From the hospital.  From the hospital.  There was one time they tried to clean him up, and he was doing well for a while.  Picked him up.  He had an ulcerated leg, so they picked him up and brought him to the hospital, detoxed  him, put him in there, and he was laying in the hospital.  I cleaned him up, cut his hair, shaved him.  We sent a listener down, or somebody down there to take pictures of him, and he talked  on the phone, and he sounded normal.  He sounded like a normal gay guy, actually.  He just, no razz to the voice. 
[01:03:30]  No, he had a little of this in his voice.  He had a little bit of this going on.  I'm like, well, you know, sometimes I just get a little crazy, and the booze really gets  to me.  It's a different guy.  They get a few beers at him.  He's like, hey, cat in my chair.  Men, women, I don't care.  Wow.  He's like an urban grizzly man, then, basically.  Yeah.  Yeah.  He's been living with the grizzlies.  Yeah.  He's been living with the subway rats. 
[01:04:00]  This one was one of my faves.  That's a big rat.  Yes, it is.  Someday you might kill me, but I don't care.  I like you.  Yeah.  One more clip here for now.  Homeless radio.  Alzer Cowie, excuse me, was big in the news this week.  So, obviously, you got to ask Tippy Tom and Blue about Alzer Cowie.  Yeah.  And this is what he had to say on Homeless Radio.  Your people are telling us we got to wrap this up.  So, we got one more topic. 
[01:04:30]  The recent death of Alzer Cowie.  Did you hear about that?  No.  The head, one of the head terrorists in Iraq got killed.  The U.S. bombed him and killed him.  What do you think about that?  What did he do wrong, number one?  He beheaded some people.  He killed people.  Yeah.  Cut off their heads and also...  What's the U.S. doing over there?  Um, bombing him.  Why? 
[01:05:00]  We're going to go around in circles, aren't we?  Because he was a bad person that was blowing up Americans and other people.  He was doing that?  Yeah.  All right.  I don't know this.  If he was doing that, he got to get his ass beat.  The thing is this.  I don't know.  That's true, Tippy Tom.  The thing is this.  I don't know.  I don't know.  You know what's funny, though?  Well, if you listen to his, after you said that he kind of had the gay accent thing going 
[01:05:30]  on, if you listen to his response to that...  You could kind of hear it.  All of a sudden, instead of being like, whoa, it was kind of like, whoa, I don't know, Stella.  Tippy Tom, show her a little ulcerated leg.  What are they doing?  Is he a bad boy over there?  Al Zarkow, it must be...  What did he do? 
[01:06:00]  What did he do?  How do you not know?  It's just the complete lack of any news.  There's got to be a certain amount of bliss in that.  You know, even though you're on the streets, you stink, you're getting ulcerated legs, you're  getting beat up for whatever little possession you have.  There's got to be this bit of bliss that I don't know what's going on, and it doesn't  even matter.  Yeah, it's get boozed every day.  I don't think he cares that there's a war going on, or even knows, or...  He doesn't even know that Earth's days are numbered. 
[01:06:30]  Earth's days are numbered.  He has no clue.  He doesn't know.  Yeah, when you're homeless, global warming is a good thing.  Global warming, I want to be warm.  He has no idea the Chinese are coming.  He doesn't know anything.  Nothing.  Building an empire over there.  Huh?  I wasn't aware of that.  Apparently they're building a lot of stuff.  They're breaking into the industrial age over there, and it's kind of hurting everybody.  The Chinese are on their way, Bill.  That's why all the oil...  That's what's going to get us in the end.  They're using all the oil.  They're building a mechanized, you know, a little machine over there. 
[01:07:00]  Chinese machine.  I don't think they have enough people to pull that off.  No.  I think that's the only thing that's kept them in check for so long.  It's too many people.  They went with the whole...  It's like a big game, this planet.  And they went with like, let's go with the strategy of just filling up the game with people.  Right.  And then they realized, ah, you got to feed them and everything.  Ah, that's the thing.  Or keep them in control.  Ah.  We here at the States, we just went with weapons. 
[01:07:30]  We just went, let's get as many weapons as we can and just let people know that we're  not afraid to use them at any given moment.  They're too busy trying to...  That's a strategy.  They're too busy trying to figure out who is who.  Yeah.  Literally.  You got to admit, though.  You got to admit, ah...  They're wasting a lot of time going, now, who...  Wait, you...  Well, wait.  But he looks like...  You isn't who.  This is the thing.  You got to give this to Asians, though.  They have stepped it up in the haircut department.  Yes.  Remember back in the day?  Oh, they haven't. 
[01:08:00]  They're now trying to highlight...  It's 80s, though.  It's a lot of 80s stuff going on.  Oh, there's definitely, yeah, the big 80s thing going on.  Yeah.  But before, like, I remember when I first got into comedy, every comedian, like, that  was like a hacky joke.  They all had the same haircut.  Yeah, yeah.  But they don't know.  They all look like they're in, like, bow, wow, wow.  Now there's, like, some spiking going on top.  Yeah, there's definitely...  Some highlighting.  They're ready for the flock of seagulls.  Yeah, they finally started...  They're just about there, man.  Well, they're as mad...  A lot of them are as mad that their hair is just straight black hair as, you know, the  person with curly hair is that, you know, they can't have it straight, you know? 
[01:08:30]  It's like...  So they got to do something with it after centuries.  They decided, you know, eh, a little hair product.  Maybe a little highlights.  Hey, we're going to go to break with Drew Boogie singing about Tibby Tom.  Ah, yes.  I don't think this side of the Opie and Anthony show has heard this yet.  It's, well, Drew Boogie remixed a Graywolf song.  Yes, Graywolf, another one of our homeless friends who has a very, very good singing voice.  Yeah.  And he's got some skills on the pan flute there. 
[01:09:00]  Yeah, he plays a flute and...  He sang a little thing in the studio.  Then Drew Boogie, one of our guys that, you know, spins for us from time to time live  in studio, took the audio and made something out of it.  And we really believe this could have been a hit.  So we try to get Graywolf to, you know, get another verse going and redo it.  And it failed miserably in studio.  His voice is shot.  In an actual studio.  Yeah.  It's all about Tibby Tom, though.  It is.  He sings about Tibby Tom.  It's Graywolf, another homeless friend of ours.  Let's see how this comes out. 
[01:09:30]  All right.  They're right there.  All right.  Here we go.  I got a break.  I'm going to throw them in the place.  I can do it.  Oh, this is nice.  Oh, you're a whore.  This is a story about a man.  He always was so lonely at night.  But his voice was rowdy.  You could hear it all through this train station.  And I'm going to sing this one.  This is about Tibby Tom. 
[01:10:00]  Let's go.  All we go.  All we go.  All we go.  It's late at night.  And I have nowhere to go.  Our money's gone and off for all my friends.  And the cop says to me.  Hey, you smell bad.  Get out of here.  And he says, and you don't have an angel. 
[01:10:30]  And he says, that angel.  Shelter me from the falling rain.  You have bombs.  This is my life.  I'm living with so much pain.  That's just a little piece. 
[01:11:00]  Welcome to the O.B. and Anthony.  Mister, are you okay?  That really looked like it hurt.  Mister.  Mister. 
[01:11:30]  Mister.  Okay, goodbye.  It's the O.B. and Anthony show.  Yankee Red Sox talk going on during the commercial break.  It's got to happen.  Oh, my God.  You know what I'm saying?  I've heard it a million times.  You know, I went to a Yankees-Red Sox game.  Actually, the one where we got killed by the Yankees, like 13 to 5. 
[01:12:00]  But the great thing as a Red Sox fan is now you go there and they can't chant 1918 anymore.  They have no chance.  So they're trying to come up with something.  And they've been going, they're going, Red Sox suck.  Like trying to still have like 1918.  It's like, dude, at least put enough words in for those syllables.  Just go like Red Sox suck.  Can't you just, yeah.  Red Sox suck.  Yeah.  Red Sox suck.  That's where the 1918 used to go.  You can't put the syllable in there, an extra syllable on suck. 
[01:12:30]  It's always, it is fun, though, even though I've heard the argument a million times.  Yeah.  When a Red Sox fan and a Yankee fan gets together, it's just, it's just.  Plus, you go back to being in like third grade or something.  All we needed was like that one championship so we can just keep talking trash.  And then you root for the Red Sox and the rest of the league.  So as long as they don't win, it's like the one thing we go, yeah, when's the last time you won?  And then they go, yeah, but we got 26.  And it just degenerates down to that.  Oh, I know. 
[01:13:00]  I'm rooting for the Red Sox this year and my Mets.  The Mets are doing great.  I want a 1986 rematch.  A lot of girls will be happy.  20 years later, how cool would that be?  It's going to be a lot of happy women.  That's a Chicks team, right?  Oh, it's not a Chicks team.  Oh, I thought the Mets were a Chicks team.  It's not a Chicks team.  It's a little pink.  You walk around Manhattan.  With the little pink hats with the Mets logo on it.  You're high, dude.  That's right.  What the hell are you smoking when you're not doing a radio show?  There are more pink Yankee hats than pink Mets hats. 
[01:13:30]  The brothers wear the pink Yankee hats.  And to be honest with their...  The brothers wear the pink Yankee hats.  They do.  You don't see white guys wearing pink Yankee hats.  The brothers aren't wearing the pink...  Because they like the colors.  Brothers can get away with wearing pink like that.  Yankee fans wear the pink panties.  Yeah.  I'll go as stylish as you're going.  Yeah.  With your gay orange sheets.  Sheets?  Seats?  Oh, no, fuck.  You finally messed up.  And then he blasts one out. 
[01:14:00]  And he moved as close as he can to me.  Give me my Mets abuse.  And then he throws a curse out hoping they dump out of the line before they bombed.  That's all you got to do is curse real close to what you just said.  I openly admitted that the Mets have the worst colors in all of the sports.  Why do they have those colors?  I don't know.  You know what I'm saying?  Oh, for the love of God.  I don't know.  It's when the Giants and the Dodgers left.  This is the awful team that they try to replace them with.  And that's Dodger blue and Giant black and orange. 
[01:14:30]  That's why.  Say it ain't so.  I really did not.  I didn't know that.  I swear to God.  I didn't know that.  I've been a Mets fan my entire life.  That's because those jets are flying over and you're bleeping in that fuel.  Yeah, that jet fuel.  That's a horrendous stadium.  They're dumping their tanks before they land right over the stadium.  At least Veterans Stadium, they didn't run out of money.  They could actually build a complete circle.  I've never seen a ballpark with no outfield seats.  It's like you hit a home run.  There's a big wind taken out of it.  You hit a home run and you see it go through the windshield of your car. 
[01:15:00]  They couldn't put that piece there or else the landing gear would hit when they're coming  into LaGuardia.  They needed like a notch in the stadium for the jets to fly through.  That awful seven train.  They still have those red cars.  From like the Leave it to Beaver era.  I haven't, you know.  It's horrible.  It's like a time machine.  I mean, we never trashed the Mets on this.  This is about time.  You know what?  Look at us getting together on this.  Yeah, here we go.  I can't argue.  When's the last time you won it? 
[01:15:30]  I've been saying for years, J. Stadium is the worst baseball stadium in the league.  It is the worst by far.  You know what?  Don't make me pull out the Adam Barr, Bill.  Let me tell you what I like about the Mets.  One more and I pull out the Adam Barr.  Uh-oh.  Adam Barr.  You should have leaned towards me.  One more and I pull out the Adam Barr.  Actually, I like the Mets.  When they get a home run and that apple pops out of the top hat, it's a magical moment to  shake.  Go ahead, Bill.  Answer that. 
[01:16:00]  Go ahead.  Answer that.  Don't be mad at me because you have a little apple coming out of a top hat.  Go ahead.  Answer that.  Mr. Met and go.  Go ahead.  Go ahead.  Add to it right now.  Go ahead.  My finger's on the button.  Go ahead.  Baseball head.  I dare you.  I double dare you.  He's got a Red Sox A-bomb.  One more.  Go ahead.  Go ahead.  That's all Bill Buckner?  That's right.  We won, though.  Oh, it's over.  Little roller up along first.  Behind the bag.  It gets Bill Buckner. 
[01:16:30]  Here comes Knight and the Mets win it.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Baby.  Yep.  That used to be painful.  No.  Now it still stings a little.  Oh, it still hurts a little.  It still stings a little.  I sit and I laugh.  I actually think about us having the, you know, the champagne ready to go.  It's just all funny now.  It's like when the Patriots, all the crap that happened to them.  You think back at the pain you felt at that moment, my friend.  No, I don't.  Because I...  Look at the Yankee fans so still wanting me to have pain. 
[01:17:00]  Please.  It still affects you.  I just...  It doesn't.  It's over.  I just remember watching going, look at the Mets.  What a choke team.  What a choke.  They stink.  They can't...  Oh, a little blooper.  What the hell is that?  You know?  Sutter rally.  Who was that?  Carter.  Got something.  Mookie.  Oh, I know.  It was Keith Hernandez.  He was already drinking a beer and smoking a cigarette.  He thought it was gone.  Oh, I love that clip.  All right.  Listen.  Let's...  Until they won it, I swear to God, I couldn't watch a night game at Shea.  It would just remind me.  Yeah.  If I went to a Met game, I would look at first base like, that's where it happened. 
[01:17:30]  Who is this?  It's really Bob Stanley.  Hey, Timmy in Queens.  What's up?  Hey, you know my favorite thing about Shea?  The stadium is the one speaker in the outfield.  The one speaker.  And when the wind blows, all of a sudden you can't hear anything the PA guy is saying.  Stadium stinks, man.  It really is bad.  But, you know, it's got good atmosphere there because it's young and all the Latinos with their flags. 
[01:18:00]  Hey, by the way, Vinny in the Bronx, Bill, you idiot.  The Mets are blue, orange, and white because those are the New York State flag colors.  They added black a few years ago to sell stuff.  Learn your stuff.  That isn't true, jackass.  Giving erroneous information about the Metropolitan.  I'm not.  That's why.  Are you?  No, I'm not.  That's how they came up with it.  It's Dodger blue and giant black and orange.  I don't know.  I stick by that.  I'll have to look into that.  You're 100% right.  Of course you are.  Yeah, let's say how to.  If I'm wrong, this is going to be a catastrophe. 
[01:18:30]  That guy tries to steer it on towards you.  That's the game.  That's how the game works.  Get it off of you and pass it off to somebody else.  You really are.  You've learned so well.  I love this.  I have nothing to say.  I'm getting pounded.  I've learned.  That's what you do.  I have nothing to say.  Get it off of me and put it on you.  Chris in Houston, what do you have?  Hey, boys.  Hey, man.  I was wondering if y'all had a chance to check out little Jimmy Norton last night.  I wasn't able to. 
[01:19:00]  I had to sleep.  Yeah, I had to sleep, too, because I was at the U.S. Open.  I had a long day, and I was in bed by like 9, I guess.  Hey, we got it in front of us.  We should play in here.  Who else was on the show with him?  Kate Beckinsale.  Who?  Oh, Kate Beckinsale?  Yeah.  Kate Beckinsale.  And Jimmy, I guess, called Roland from L.A. going,  You got to get Kate on the show.  Really?  Yeah, I guess he was obsessing about her.  Every time Jimmy's on Jay Leno, there's some hot chick on the couch next to him.  I think they've been doing that on purpose because it's worked out so well. 
[01:19:30]  He's had some really funny moments with the hot chicks that sit next to him.  Right.  He's such a creep.  Right.  He sits there, and just him looking over, and his shoulders go up to his ears,  and he looks over at the girl and kind of nods.  He goes, hi.  And the audience loses their mind.  They just start cracking up like, look at this little creep talking to this beautiful girl.  Little did I know he wants to get him back here to go on the Liberator.  Oh, of course.  What do you got, then?  There was also a cute little moment between Kate and Jim last night.  At the end, when they're all brought out for the thank yous, 
[01:20:00]  she stumbled a bit and fell back into Jim, and he had to sort of support her.  Oh, God.  I can't wait to see the video.  God knows what kind of evidence is on her dress now.  I DVR'd that.  Hey, before we play Jim Norton really fast,  Bud Light presents the Opie and Anthony Traveling Virus,  the comedy event of 2006, coming soon to a venue near you.  So far, August 5th, Worcester, Centrum in Boston.  August 26th, the PNC Bank Art Center in Jersey.  September 9th, the Tweeter Center in Camden, New Jersey, across the river there in Philly. 
[01:20:30]  Okay?  Tickets on sale this morning in, like, a little over an hour.  A little over an hour.  Tickets going on sale.  Pick them up, my friends.  They're all Ticketmaster locations.  Presented by Bud Light.  Always worth it.  Nice.  And the lineups are just unbelievable.  For the PNC Bank Art Center show, Saturday, August 26th,  you're talking about Rich Voss, Patrice O'Neill, Bill Burr, Bob Kelly, Tracy Morgan,  Bob Saget, Carl Smancia, Jim Norton.  Are you excited to be part of this, Bill?  No.  Excited to go to Worcester. 
[01:21:00]  What's wrong with going to Worcester?  Brings back memories of when I used to perform at the Aku Aku Chinese restaurant.  Yeah?  For Dick Doherty.  I never...  Oh, that's right.  There was a Chinese restaurant up there that did comedy.  I forgot about it.  I never got that whole thing.  There's plenty of them.  There's like all over the country.  They got like Chinese restaurants where you guys play,  and I never could figure that out.  Horrific.  Right.  They have up in Boston, they have the poo-poo platter.  The little flame is in the middle, and they have chicken fingers.  And you got to make these people laugh. 
[01:21:30]  Yeah.  Oh, especially when I was doing those.  I was never closing.  I had started out, so I was like one of the first guys up.  So people were just chowing down as I was up there.  As soon as you made them laugh, there was like egg rolls coming out of their mouth.  He's terrible.  What's up, Jimmy?  Hey!  Oh, my God.  Look who's in!  Also, the Boston Worcester Show on August 5th.  The lineup.  Rich Voss, Patrice O'Neal, Bill Burr, Ralphie Mae, Bob Kelly, Tracy Morgan, Bob Saget, and Jim Norton.  I thought that was like a listener who looked like him. 
[01:22:00]  I know.  I was still in L.A.  I was like, that's uncanny.  And you said, hey, Jim.  And I looked at the phones.  Like, is he calling in?  And finally, really fast.  Camden, New Jersey, across the river in Philly at the Tweeter Center.  Jimmy Schubert, Don Barrera, Rich Voss, Patrice O'Neal, Bill Burr, Ralphie Mae, Bob Kelly, Tracy Morgan, Bob Saget, and Jim Norton.  Don't forget, tickets go on sale this morning at 9 a.m. through all Ticketmaster locations.  All right?  Jimmy, we're about to play your Leno set.  Oh, okay.  I didn't see it.  We didn't see it either because we went to bed early. 
[01:22:30]  Tom says break before that.  Tom says break before that?  Who the hell is he?  Well, you tell Tom, okay.  Tippy Tom?  Well, I tell Tom.  Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.  Take a break.  You gotta take a break.  Well, I tell Tom, go outside and then don't be scared of the sun.  That's what I say today.  Oh, my God.  We're wrecking the flow of this show.  All right, we'll take a break.  David. 
[01:23:00]  We'll take a break.  What are you selling, cat chickens?  That's like a homeless, what the hell was, what was the girl's name we used to make?  Oh, Tara Reid.  Tara Reid, yeah.  Tara Reid, oh, my God, you guys.  Welcome to my show, Tara Ball.  And we're going to do some today.  We're going to go power gliding, power gliding, power, what is it called?  I don't know what it's called, but we're all going to go down to the beach.  What are you talking about power gliding?  And we're going to go down there.  We're going to hold on now.  Why don't you get naked?  Just take your clothes off. 
[01:23:30]  Oh, my God, this guy smells so bad, you guys.  We're all going to go power gliding today.  I'm Tara Reid, your host for Tara Ball.  All right, Tara, we're ready.  You're ready to go?  Oh, my God, are you crazy?  I'm not going to do that.  I'll just hang out and watch everybody.  Hook me up.  I'll do it.  I'll do anything.  Is it warm up there?  I get a little cold.  And she wonders why her show got canceled, by the way.  She never would do the things they wanted her to do. 
[01:24:00]  Oh, my God, it's going to be so fun.  We're going to do some water skiing here in the Mediterranean, the Gulf of the Mediterranean,  whatever it's called, something, and we're going to have fun.  I'm going to get out there on water skis.  It's going to be awesome and everything.  All right, Tara, we're ready for the water ski segment.  Are you crazy?  There's sharks out there.  I'm not doing it.  Tara, you've got to do something.  I'll just sit on the – I'll just drink and not be able to talk.  There was one episode she was doing windsurfing on the beach.  Oh, my God, you guys were supposed to do windsurfing today.  She went through all the training, I guess, or they did the piece, and then they showed 
[01:24:30]  her just on the sand.  Yeah, on the sand, holding it.  Oh, my God, I bet this is so hot in the water.  It was so much fun.  But I'm not going to do it.  It was funny even on the – oh, yeah, she was going to run with the bulls, and she  didn't do it.  I'll run with the bulls and somewhere with a P.  And it's so much fun.  I'm going to be – it's so dangerous and stuff.  I'm just going to sit here and drink a tag.  I'll just have another drink.  She didn't – she never did anything but drink and smoke.  All right, we'll take a break. 
[01:25:00]  Jim Norton's in the house here.  Jim Norton, oh, my God.  We want to play his Leno set, but now we've got to wait until after the break to –  Whoa, whoa, whoa.  What do you mean you've got to wait until after the break?  I don't know, to stay ahead of the game a little bit.  Sell some chicken, cat.  Cat chicken.  Actually, we can play another clip from Tippy Tom, Homeless Radio, as we go to –  All right.  It's a shorty.  That sounds good.  He's talking about the homeless problem.  Ah, problem.  He asked about the homeless problem.  Who would know better?  Mirror, sir. 
[01:25:30]  Here's Homeless Radio with Tippy Tom.  Jeff from New York.  How would you solve the homeless problem if you were president of the United States?  Tom.  Tippy Tom.  The homeless problem.  What I would do is take all that taxpayer's money and I'd build more –  in housing so these people will have to live outside.  Okay.  In the ring.  I'm a homeless man. 
[01:26:00]  And it's not that expensive.  They spend billions of dollars on military weapons.  Why can't they spend a billion dollars?  For the homeless.  For the homeless.  Yes.  Why can't you live in a missile?  Get rid of the military.  All right.  We need a storm military.  Compromise, my friend.  I'm all for that.  A dirty bomb.  But the thing is this, is that we got people that need a place to live.  And there you have it. 
[01:26:30]  Homeless Radio with Tippy Tom.  Just a missile of like mosquitoes and fleas.  Fox 1, missile away.  We have a dirty bomb headed toward the palace.  Wait, why am I flying?  Why am I flying to the air?  Where are you sending me?  Like, I don't want to go there and explode.  Why don't you send a strap of chicken to a bar?  My head is dangerous.  All right.  Dirty bomb. 
[01:27:00]  We really got to take a break.  It's the O&A virus spreading across America.  Our duties do do do do.  Our duties do do do do.  Our duties do do do.  Have destructive power.  You think it stinks now.  You should have seen it a month ago.  Hear what everybody else is talking about.  O&A, uncut and live.  Continuing the show on XM Satellite Radio.

[01:27:30]  You're winning now.  This is the Opie and Anthony Show.  Hope you're enjoying the festivities today.  Bill Burr in-house.  And Jim Norton, fresh from a red eye, I guess.  Huh, Jimmy?  Yeah, the plane was like 45 minutes late.  It was really irritating.  He was on Leno last night and he's here this morning.  Like, somehow that doesn't make sense to me at all.  The miracle of modern transportation.  Yeah, man.  I like to get out of town.  You know how it is.  You don't want a gig.  You just want to go, man.  I don't want to stay in L.A. 
[01:28:00]  Yeah.  Oh, absolutely.  As soon as I can.  L.A.  Just people there.  Yeah.  Disgusting.  The clubs.  Had a nice chat.  What's your name?  Kate, the chick.  Kate Beckinsale?  Yeah.  We were just talking during the break about how awful L.A. is.  What a little potty mouth she is.  Really?  She dropped the C-bomb.  I'm in love with her.  Wow.  During the commercial break?  Yeah.  We were talking.  I'm like, she's like, yeah, I live here.  She's like, oh, it's so boring out here.  I'm like, yeah, it sucks.  She's like, yeah, if you say C or you light a cigarette, they freak out.  And she said it. 
[01:28:30]  I was like, I really want to.  Nice.  Yeah, she's a good egg.  She's a good egg.  She's a lovely girl.  She sounds sweet.  Yeah.  Jay was asking for you guys, of course.  Ah, Jay.  Ah, tell him we said hi.  Yeah.  How cool is that?  Buddy, Jay was asking about you.  You know, that, Jay.  Because of Jim.  No, he actually, no, no.  He's aware of the fact that the show is doing well.  No, no.  He's, he's, no.  That's really cool.  Tell him I read his Popular Mechanics article every month.  I didn't mention it.  Damn it.  I was too busy nodding going, no, okay, okay. 
[01:29:00]  Well, we got to play Jim's set.  Do you mind, Jim?  I probably won't listen to it, but yeah, go ahead.  Oh, yeah.  I know how that is.  That makes you feel all, like, warm.  Oh, my God.  I can't wait to actually see it.  I DVR'd it.  But you're funny.  Thank you, but you know how it is, man.  I know.  You were up too late for me last night, so.  Oh, yeah.  Don't blame me, dude.  Well, we're very proud.  I mean, Jimmy was on Jay Leno last night.  We should play his set here on the show, definitely.  So, from last night, even though he's in studio, back here in New York, our pal Jim Jordan. 
[01:29:30]  Do you want to play part of it?  I don't want to take the whole show up with it.  No, we're playing the whole thing.  I'm shy.  It's Friday.  Who are you kidding?  We're sailing today.  All righty.  My next guest, 12 stars in the new HBO series, Lucky Louie.  His new DVD, One Night Stands, is in stores right now.  He's also on the Opie and Anthony Show, the hottest show on satellite radio during the week.  A huge show every Monday through Friday next time.  Please welcome Jim Norton, ladies and gentlemen. 
[01:30:00]  Thanks, everybody.  How are you?  I am in a really good mood.  I saw my parents yesterday.  And they're supposed to come over at noon.  Why do parents do this?  My phone rings 820 in the morning.  Hi, we're three blocks away.  And you've got to let them come over.  What are you going to say?  Could you wait a couple hours? 
[01:30:30]  I have to hide $4,000 worth of pornography.  And you can never get it all hidden.  So now my mother wants to borrow blacks and blondes because she thinks it's a Mickey Rooney film.  I occasionally watch adult films, you know, whenever I'm awake.  I tried to emulate what I saw, so I shaved everything. 
[01:31:00]  Everything.  When I'm nude, I look like a tall infant.  I even sound like one.  When I make love, I go,  I am vocal in bed to answer your questions.  Love to talk dirty, but only with a lisp.  Yeah, get on your knees. 
[01:31:30]  There's a fine line.  When you're talking dirty,  there's a fine line between sexy and horrendous  because what works in real life does not work  when you're trying to be dirty.  Like, being polite is acceptable,  but in bed is kind of a vibe killer.  You know, if a girl's like,  Oh, I like that.  Hey, thanks a million.  Sarcasm.  I love sarcasm in real life,  but in bed, it wrecks everything.  You know, you're with a girl.  She's like,  Oh, that feels good.  Does it?  I couldn't tell because I'm stupid. 
[01:32:00]  Everything in life is tone.  It's not what you say.  It's how you say it.  That's my problem when I approach women.  I try to be fun and endearing,  but it comes off as menacing and unpleasant.  Like, I'll see a group of girls,  and I'll walk over.  Hey, it looks like the party's over here.  And if you don't believe me  that tone is important,  walk up to a woman pushing a stroller 
[01:32:30]  and go,  Nice baby!  It's so fun to irritate somebody with a baby  because they're so easily bothered.  I love walking up to them.  Hey, great baby.  Can I pick it up?  Come on, I'll bring it back.  Let me touch him.  He looks soft.  You ever have a parent get mad at you  when you make a gender error  about their stupid infant?  There's no way to tell.  It's this big, 
[01:33:00]  wearing a one-piece outfit,  that awful asexual bonnet,  fat featureless face.  It's the ultimate poker face.  It gives away nothing.  So I'm trying to be polite.  I'm like,  Ah, how old is he?  And the mother freaks out.  She is six weeks.  She's a she.  Oh, why don't you put a thong on her  and bring her back  when she's 18. 
[01:33:30]  I said 18 to make that joke  slightly more acceptable.  You ever have like,  you try to use your sense of humor  like on a date  and it just gets nothing  and you feel like a silly goose?  I was out with this girl.  She's looking through my glove compartment  and she finds condoms  and she's like,  What are these for?  So I'm trying to be funny.  I'm like,  They're going to save your life tonight.  Believe me. 
[01:34:00]  How else do you respond  to that uncomfortable question?  I don't know.  I never use them.  I just put them on my fingers  and act wacky.  For the record,  I hate condoms.  Hate them.  But, you know,  I use them  if she says something.  If the girl doesn't notice,  it's potluck.  Come on, healthy. 
[01:34:30]  You ever panic after sex?  I mean, look,  sex is a powerful thing, man,  because, you know,  your mind says,  If you do this,  you might die.  30 seconds later,  your mind goes,  And again,  maybe you won't.  You ever panic  and start noticing things  about the person  you probably should have  picked up on a little earlier?  Hey,  have you been a Haitian male  this whole time?  Thank you a lot,  everybody.  I appreciate it.  There he is, 
[01:35:00]  little Jimmy Norton.  Very good.  Oh, man.  That's a great set.  I know.  I can't believe  the stuff he got away with.  That was great.  Well,  Jimmy's talked about it  on the show.  How much Jay allows  over there.  Yeah.  Condom joke was killer.  Jimmy ran into the bathroom  during that.  He's shy.  He's shy.  He doesn't like the attention.  He's scared.  What's wrong, Jimmy?  I hate listening to myself.  You did a great job.  That was a massive set.  It was good.  It was good.  I had to switch up  last minute.  There was one  that I told you  they wouldn't allow,  so I was kind of annoyed 
[01:35:30]  that I had to switch that,  but not with that.  Yeah, but you didn't  have any,  okay, I'm doing a TV set  cheesy material.  No.  That was very edgy.  You didn't have like the...  No, it was a regular set  pretty much.  Yeah.  It was very edgy  even for Leno, right?  That's what I'm saying.  I'm wondering  if any of his material  that was on Leno  will make the dump report  on this show today.  Oh, that'll be interesting.  I know, right?  Was anybody listening?  I don't know.  I didn't really hear anything  that should have.  Oh, if they dumped out,  Jimmy will lose his mind  later on.  I didn't hear anything  that should have  been dumped out.  We'll have to wait 
[01:36:00]  and see on that.  And then Jimmy sat down,  did panel.  It's only a minute long.  Could you sit through  another minute?  Nothing got done.  And then Jimmy got to sit  with Leno on the couch there.  Of course he did.  What was that magazine?  Blacks on blondes.  Is that what it was?  That's it.  Hey, you got yourself  a TV show.  You got a radio show.  You're shooting a show  here in L.A.  Have you moved out here yet?  No.  I actually want to move to L.A.,  but I bought a place  in New York  and I'm not a good decorator.  Like, I'm 37.  I still don't know  how to match, like,  carpeting with framed kiss posters. 
[01:36:30]  Yeah.  So I have my gay friend  helping me  and it's stereotypical  gay people decorating,  but this guy's a genius.  The problem is  gay people are so arrogant  when it comes to things like that.  We're sofa shopping  and I find one I like  so I call him over  and I'm like,  you know,  what do you think?  And he runs his hand  over the back of it  and he's really loud  and he goes,  argh!  The material's too rough.  This is hideous.  And then I realized  we had different priorities  when sofa shopping.  When I'm buying one,  I don't have to wonder  what it's going to feel like.  Mushed into my face  for an hour and a time.  Oh, thank God. 
[01:37:00]  Wow.  Wow.  Oh, jeez.  You have to think  of those things.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Well, look,  I try to react  the same around all my friends.  We had a really  uncomfortable moment  of...  Still getting laughed.  We're hanging out.  We're hanging out.  And you see this  very good-looking  blonde-haired guy  across the store  and he kind of says to me,  you know,  you see him?  And he goes,  we used to work out  at the same gym.  I had him in the shower.  And I kind of wished  he wasn't comfortable  enough with me 
[01:37:30]  to blurt that out.  Yeah, I still found myself  going,  what happened?  Well, Jim,  congratulations.  You got your radio show,  you got your TV show,  you got your DVD.  Give him a hug.  Thank you, buddy.  Aw, Jimmy,  you killed, man.  That was great.  That was killed.  That joke is funny  and I don't know  how the hell  they let you say that.  They actually,  that was supposed  to be my third joke  that made me put it first,  like on panel.  They know what you're  going to do on panel.  Yeah.  So just so you know  and they made me  put it first. 
[01:38:00]  That got a great laugh.  Yeah, that got a nice one.  Like people caught on  to what it was about.  It took like a little beat there  and then,  oh my God,  it's a gay guy  face thrust  into the couch joke.  Wonderful.  Aw, congrats.  I'm always so proud  when you come back.  Look at that,  Jimmy just hanging out  with Jay Leno.  John in New York,  what's up?  Hi, fellas,  how you doing today?  Hey.  Jimmy,  oh my God,  absolutely killed.  Outstanding.  Thank you.  You know what?  But you know what I noticed  most of all? 
[01:38:30]  I'm watching it back  right now, actually,  and you're so natural  with your hands.  I don't understand  why you have such a problem  when you're acting.  Well, it's just different  when I'm acting.  Because he's just being him.  See,  when he has to play  another person,  his hands just go awry.  Where do you put them?  I don't know.  What do you do?  I try to sit on them.  They hang there?  Too far from the body  or too close?  I'm watching it right now.  I'm watching you  the tone of voice bit  and, oh, it's amazing.  Anyway, punching out, guys.  Great job.  And some feedback going nuts.  Everyone loving the couch fact joke. 
[01:39:00]  That is a funny joke, man.  Hey, when you did your set,  did you mic or no mic?  I never use a mic there.  Really?  Which is always weird  because I make myself  practice with it in the stand  when you're doing your warm-up  for your second.  It's really weird  to not hold a mic.  I did that one time  on Conan  and halfway through my set,  I started getting self-conscious  because you're so used  to holding a mic  that I did like three jokes  with my arms crossed  like Ed Sullivan  or something.  And I just watched it back  and it just looked, 
[01:39:30]  I think by the end of it,  like my shirt was wrinkled  around my waist.  Oh, no.  Yeah, it was brutal.  It was brutal.  It's like, ah.  And right after that,  I've always used a mic.  What do you have?  Just one of the clip-on collar?  Clip-on collar, yeah.  Put them in your pocket sometimes  or like on your hips.  I never know what to do  with them either.  That's weird for a comic  because the mic is kind of  part of what you're doing.  Yeah, you hold on to one.  You can even grab the stand  for security sometimes  like you're really nervous.  You should just hold  the stand for a second  and it just kind of  centers you and focuses you.  How do you do  the metal detector joke?  Oh, that cracks them up. 
[01:40:00]  I try to mime like a bull  like I'm sweeping up.  How do you do the big darts  stuck in my head joke?  Put the mic stand down  as a prop, stupid.  Wait a minute.  Wait a minute.  I had a joke  where it was a metal detector.  Wait a second.  What joke?  When?  I did it on TV too.  When?  No.  How long ago?  It better have been  1980-something.  No, no.  It was in the 2000s.  Oh, no.  It better have been  comedy on the road.  It was after Y2K. 
[01:40:30]  Hey, wait a second.  Wow.  What about the fat guy?  Can he come out  and move it aside  and go,  hey, just let me get this  out of the way  so you can see me?  He's got a mimic  moving something.  Yeah, right.  Because there's nothing there.  Nothing.  A couple more phone calls.  I have to lift his neck fat  up off the microphone.  Let me lift this out of the way  so you can hear me.  Hey, it's Ralph on Long Island.  Ralph.  Hey there, Ralph.  First thing first,  no homo.  All right.  Right?  He looked good the other night,  Jimmy.  Oh, thank you.  Last night, yeah. 
[01:41:00]  Hey, listen, I'm my homo.  All right.  You said no homo.  He still felt all you've got to say.  Let's go to Tony on Long Island.  I know.  A lot of Long Islanders today.  Tony, what's up?  Little homo.  Hello.  Hey, go ahead, Danny.  Go, Tony.  Yeah.  Jim, what do you got?  A brother, there's all in your ears.  You want to say you're unbelievable.  Let's go to Sammy in Queens.  Sammy.  Hey, good morning, guys.  Hey.  Hey, Jimmy.  Yes, sir.  How hot is Kate Beckinsale in person?  Because she looked great on TV.  She is despicably attractive. 
[01:41:30]  Yeah.  It was depressing how good looking she is.  I mean, the last time was Keira Knightley, Kate Beckinsale.  They put me with the hottest chicks, but I didn't have time to interact with her.  I had a really creepy one ready, too, but I just didn't have time because they let me  go longer on my set, so I only had time for like a minute and a half on panel.  But I had a weird moment with her.  At the end, you walk over with Jay to where the band is, and then you do promos and say  goodnight and all that stuff.  So I'm walking with her as the band wrapped up, and she steps on my foot, and she's like,  oh, I'm sorry.  And I'm like, well, how funny would it be if we both just fell and really hurt ourselves.  And she's like, it would be really funny because I'm not wearing any underwear. 
[01:42:00]  And she wasn't kidding.  Jesus.  She wasn't kidding.  Are you?  God.  Yeah.  She was dead serious.  I'm like, yeah, I can't go, Commander.  And then she said something else, so I knew she wasn't kidding.  She's a dirty girl.  I think you had a shot.  Well, she took my information.  She's a lovely girl.  She what?  She took my number.  She what?  She what?  She's going to be in New York.  You have.  You gave Kate Beckinsale your number.  Yeah.  Did she ask for it?  Yes.  Well, she said to me.  She just shoved it in her face.  Just take it, bitch.  Call me.  Call me.  Call me.  No, she's like, I'm going to be in New York next week. 
[01:42:30]  Are you performing in New York?  And I'm like, yeah, I perform at the Comedy Cellar.  Holy.  And she's like, well, I'd love to come see you when I'm there.  I'm like, okay.  And she's like, I'll give you my information.  She's like, okay, sure.  I should put all this stuff down.  I gave her my number.  Please mention that.  Can I hang around in the back when that happens?  Yeah.  Yeah, sit there and make sure Sherrod or Godfrey doesn't talk to her.  I know, right?  Please tell me you also said you do a radio show in New York.  The first thing I told her was I would try to get you on the show.  And I said I called Roland last night. 
[01:43:00]  Yeah, we were talking about that earlier because that's all Roland would talk about in the office before the show.  All right.  Now I'm completely annoyed.  Why?  I just punched up a picture.  Is that her?  Oh, my God.  Yeah, she's fantastic.  You've never seen her before?  I've seen her, but, you know, the name and the face doesn't ring a bell.  What?  But she...  She's beautiful, man.  If she calls you, I'll shoot you.  Um...  Because she shouldn't be calling.  That could be the end of Jim Norton. 
[01:43:30]  Yeah, that's it.  If I had a shot at dating her, I would change.  No, you wouldn't.  I would just take my blog down.  Would she be the one?  Please.  Like, would she be the one that would be like, you know...  Please, someone get a hold of her and tell her to rip up that number.  Because if there's any interaction with Jim and her and then it goes bad, it's over, man.  Jimmy's jumping out of that window.  Oh, he'll be so gone.  Just rip up the number now, please.  He'll be on 10-10 wins.  Right.  I really thought I had a shot, too. 
[01:44:00]  A little fat breast.  Right.  Pinching my book.  Oh, I knew it.  I always knew it.  I can just see it now.  Lose the number, please.  We don't want to go down that road.  Well, peace bitch in that we're not mentioning the comedy tour.  Enough.  What comedy tour?  Our comedy tour.  Well, if you mentioned it...  He's emailing Ben like crazy.  He's got to mention it more.  He's got to mention it more.  Because tickets are going on sale in a half hour.  I think we're doing a pretty good job with the announcement.  First date in Augusta, Maine. 
[01:44:30]  And we've got Bud Light sponsoring the thing now.  Bud Light.  The Opian Anthony Traveling Virus, the comedy event of 2006, coming soon to a venue near you.  We've been talking about this all morning.  We've got three dates.  August 5th, Worcester Center in Boston.  August 26th, PNC Bank Arts Center in Jersey.  And September 9th, the Tweeter Center in Camden, New Jersey, across the river there in Philly.  Great lineups for all three shows.  Should we run through the lineups or are people getting it by now?  It's all the friends of the show, basically, on one stage, one night there. 
[01:45:00]  PNC Bank Arts Center, real fast.  Saturday, August 26th.  Rich Voss, Patrice O'Neill, Bill Burr, Bob Kelly, Tracy Morgan, Bob Saget, Carlos Mencia, and Jim Norton.  Boston, Worcester, DCU Center.  Saturday, August 5th.  Rich Voss, Patrice O'Neill, Bill Burr, Ralphie Mae, Bob Kelly, Tracy Morgan, Bob Saget, Jim Norton.  And Philly, Camden, New Jersey, Tweeter Center.  Saturday, September 9th.  That's a huge show.  There's like ten comedians on this bill.  Jimmy Schubert, Don Marrera, Rich Voss, Patrice O'Neill, Bill Burr, Ralphie Mae, Bob Kelly, Tracy Morgan, Bob Saget, and Jim Norton. 
[01:45:30]  Tickets go on sale in a little over a half hour from right now through all Ticketmaster locations.  Okay?  Wonderful.  Mentioned?  Mentioned again, yes.  Kate just separated from her husband?  Is that what a rumor has it?  I didn't know.  Because then I'm getting other things that say she's married or is engaged to be married.  Oh, maybe she is.  But, or at least engaged.  But then just separated from husband?  I don't know.  Trying to help you out here. 
[01:46:00]  Well, she did.  Help me out of here, Hendry.  Yeah, I'm trying to bang this broad.  I ask you for nothing.  She's prejudiced against nobodies.  No, she just wants to come to a show.  And so I would love to get her on the show, man.  And hopefully Roland can call her.  You know what?  That would be like XM material.  Can I talk for everybody?  If she walked into the studio, we'd all just be like, da, da.  We stink in front of hot chicks.  We had pretty girls on.  When?  We had Mila Jovovich and we had a lot of fun with her.  Oh, yeah.  We did all right with her.  So maybe we're turning that around. 
[01:46:30]  You're right.  And then we had the girl from the Scary Movies movies.  Anna Francis.  Anna, Anna.  Oh, but just be yourself.  Ferris.  I'm not the only one.  This is cool.  One day we finally all admitted this, Bill.  Who was it, though?  Because she was kind of hard to interview.  Well, it's either hot girls that aren't porn stars.  Or smart girls.  Or very smart, intelligent girls.  Those are the worst, actually.  We really fall apart when we realize there's a woman in the studio that actually has a brain.  And can see us for what we are. 
[01:47:00]  Which is garbage.  Yeah.  We ought to just stay in man town.  Man town.  Where no women are allowed.  That's right.  Yeah.  All right.  Come on, everyone.  Pull them out.  Come on.  It's man town.  Stephen Lynch is here.  Ooh.  We'll talk to our old friend who's a Broadway star.  Broadway star, Stephen Lynch.  Tony nominee, Stephen Lynch.  Look what's going on right in front of our eyes.  Norton on Leno last night.  Stephen Lynch, Broadway star.  Kate Beckinsale's phone numbers.  All kinds of things going down. 
[01:47:30]  Lynch used to sing dirty songs.  Now he was up for a Tony this year.  I'm sure he won't admit to singing dirty songs now.  Yeah.  That wasn't my.  I don't know what you're talking about.  Let me do a number now from my Broadway show.  Wedding singer.  He's going to come in here with an AIDS ribbon.  It's a new song called Save a Kitten.  Hey, give me Killer Kitten as we go to break.  Oh, no.  He's not getting off the hook that easy.  Erick, get me Killer Kitten.  This is Stephen Lynch who we'll be talking to next. 
[01:48:00]  This is the Stephen Lynch we know and love.  Not the one you see on the commercials for the Broadway show.  The Wedding Singer.  Right.  Playing his guitar, smiling.  People dancing behind him.  This one, he's graphically talking about killing a baby cat.  Oh, cat.  What is this Kentucky fat chicken?  All right.  Now I got to find it.  Oh, boy.  It's the hidden track off his CD A Little Bit Special. 
[01:48:30]  Yeah.  I'm sure he wanted that track hidden.  It was hidden.  Now I got to find it.  Hold on.  I know.  Hanging out with Rosie O'Donnell.  Yeah.  Disgusting global warming and breast cancer.  You know, I think we can make a difference.  We all get together and...  Yeah.  How am I going to play this?  We're having this benefit down in the village.  I'm there.  I'm there.  You got another version of it?  Yeah, he...  Rosie, you couldn't keep me away.  You know, one of the great things about being an entertainer is you get to help people. 
[01:49:00]  I'm always willing to loan my time to a cause.  You know, in my Broadway show, The Wedding Singer, we're all having a lot of fun, but  some people with cancer don't have fun.  I'm here to tell you to give generously.  He starts playing a violin instead of his guitar.  It's fun to laugh, but don't forget there are those that cry.  Three-inch studio. 
[01:49:30]  I don't know.  He's going to smash us when he comes in.  And, well, he should.  Oh, they're holding him down in the green room.  Oh, yeah.  In there.  What are you, Ales?  We'll do this.  We've got to figure out what version we can play on this half-year-old.  Why don't you play some of that?  What do you want us to stall any longer?  Come on.  No kidding.  How much longer can we possibly stall?  Well, if they dump out, we'd lose four or five seconds of the song, so I'd rather play  the version that might have a beep in it.  So if you hear a beep, relax, X-Amers.  Well, Curtis, think of what's Kill a Kitten.  Huh? 
[01:50:00]  I don't know.  There might be something.  Doesn't do that to the kitten.  We'll go to break with Stephen Lynch at Kill a Kitten.  Horrible.  And we'll talk to him next.  And why kill him.  When the game of life makes you feel like quitting  It helps a lot if you kill a kitten  Mark my words, cause from where I'm sitting 
[01:50:30]  You can't go wrong if you kill a kitten  There's no crime that you'll be committing  I know the law 
[01:51:00]  You can't kill a kitten  And if you need yarn for that scarf you're knitting  You'll get plenty when you kill a kitten  Feed it turpentine  Or break its spine  Or break its spine  Crush it with your shoe 
[01:51:30]  As long as you can  A kitten  Listen up  If the one you love  If the one you love isn't quite as smitten  She'll like you better when you kill a kitten  And I'll quote the Bible  Cause that's where it's written 
[01:52:00]  If he loveth Jesus  If he loveth Jesus  He must kill a kitten  Blush him down the can  Hit him with your van  Throw him at a train  Make him snort cocaine  Drown him in a lake  Bake a kitty cake 
[01:52:30]  Slick some TNT  Do what you must do  As long as you  Kill a kitten  Meow  Killing kittens isn't easy 
[01:53:00]  And if the thought makes you feel queasy  Grab a pitchfork from the shed  And kill a puppy dog instead  Yeah  Kill a kitten  You've got to  Kill a kitten  A little furry kitten  You've got to 
[01:53:30]  Kill a kitten  Kill a little f***ing kitten  Kill a little f***ing kitten  Kill a kitten  Kill a kitten  onions why does my crotch smell like onions i don't remember eating did i sit in onions  did i sit in onions the opie and anthony show

[01:56:30]  going to that show and you told me not to yeah this is a g-rated show you don't want to go to that  show no they decided to make the wednesday matinee for kids which is i think ridiculous so we had to  take all the profanity out of it don't you say that's ridiculous that's a smart move and lynch did  you just kiss it but it sucks for the show did you or did you not after the xm show call me  personally go don't come today don't come today i did i did i was on my way there yes i did i didn't  want you to see that way that's bad he had a playbill uh walking down the avenue that's right and 
[01:57:00]  steven was saying during your top hat and your cane and the great white way steven was saying during  the break how repulsive he finds the gay lifestyle no no no off to get some feedback speaking of which  kevin from connecticut writes he should have sang if i were gay at the tony's i don't think that  would have gone over very well i kind of did do you find a lot of really watch it do you find a  lot of uh gay gentlemen involved with the production well it is the theater yes after all but what what 
[01:57:30]  what people are telling me is that we have a crazy inordinate amount of straight dudes and  straight guys yeah and we play poker every day in my dressing room yeah as opposed to  drink every night just when they play the other shows a little poker joke  poker does seem like you're trying a little too hard to be a man yeah we sit around  we call it man town yeah backstage that sounds like a broadway musical doesn't it man town man town 
[01:58:00]  where they all go to just be men that's uh that's cool i i i how did how did you get it like i know  you do theater all over the you've done theater all over the country right no no i just did i  know you've done nothing i did summer stock in michigan right in michigan okay you know where you  mow lawns all day and then you go have maybe a couple lines in a show and then you you know  park cars and do box office so to the people that have like toiled their entire life to try 
[01:58:30]  to work their way to broadway how did you go from a crappy summer stock to broadway starring  mind you in a broadway production i don't know they were just looking for somebody who sang and  could do comedy and what a manager agent said they're auditioning for this yeah well you know  i was at william morris at the time and i had a comedy little agency called william morris  i don't know but they uh they have a theatrical agency and my manager was like hey if anything 
[01:59:00]  good comes along throw his name out there and they did and i went and auditioned and as legend has it  i'm the only person who auditioned for the role but i don't know if that's true that might just be a  good story that they want me to tell that's a bad story yeah i'm the only guy who's only willing to do  it but but it is perfect for the part because you know you're funny and musicals and that's what  they're kind of looking for but it's not like adam sandler comparisons all the time when i'd  start it out yeah because i'm doing comedy songs and and and for an entry kind of an entry-level 
[01:59:30]  broadway job it is good for you because it's not like you know les mis you know now you gotta kind  of i couldn't picture stephen lynch in les mis you know to start with why not but maybe well i'm  saying like to start because that seems more than this this role is i know what you do any jackass  it's not any jackass you're right you're absolutely right i agree with what you do you play guitar you're  funny guy you're kind of you know got that attitude chops chops to do the way it's sad but to be like 
[02:00:00]  you know the barricades are up and i need it the revolution is you know that's a little different  than what you're doing but are you learning like stuff from this that you think you might be able to  take uh with you to some other production at some point no not that i'm saying the show is you know  this is the end of my broad is this it i'm officially announcing my retirement is it too  much work it sucks eight effing shows a week eight shows how do you keep it interesting because 
[02:00:30]  you're you're singing the same i do what i told you i try to make my friends on stage laugh right  little things little things here and there you know because it must get monotonous yes you know  every night and these are things that the audience would never pick up yeah obviously but you know  when you go out on stage you say yeah and on drums lil jimmy you know yeah your friends know that  you're effing around obviously in the audience is like oh okay lil jimmy oh is that lil oh that's  wonderful watch the movie and see if his name was lil jimmy in the movie yeah how those those fans are 
[02:01:00]  like he wasn't lil jimmy in the movie that was how similar is it to the uh movie besides you know  people dancing around a lot it's pretty similar yeah the storyline pretty much the storyline's still the  same yeah but then they throw dance numbers and there's big big dance numbers did you have a  problem with that how much dancing do you actually do very little very little as little as possible  i'm not a dancer that's what i was saying there's a move i do in this in this song that's kind of like  this new edition song where all the dudes are trying to convince me that the single life is the 
[02:01:30]  life for me and all i have to do is climb up on this bar and spin once right i can't do it  i cannot do it i fall off the bar i trip on my side i get halfway around and stop oh no it's  humiliating facing the audience yeah he's got to turn around yeah you're singing to like the beer  taps it's true hey where am i oh my god that's funny yeah because you and then when i nail it i'm  like yeah nailed it i did it nice yeah wow but yeah i'm not a dancer clearly no no 
[02:02:00]  but yeah that's not why they hired me it's not like i go well you know you're no dancer it's like  no i'm i'm not a dancer i do have to dance dance moves and they take you into like one of those  rooms with like yes with the hardwood floors yeah the bar and the hammies some guy with leg warmers  okay five six seven eight yes exactly oh my god yeah it was oh would you want to do the latin hustle 
[02:02:30]  it's a new album from tavaras i know something else that's a little different you're drinking water  there steven instead of beer you mean yeah because you use i said i'd take a beer but nobody oh you did  okay i've noticed you think i'm trying to clean up my act i don't know we're just trying to get to  know you again i've heard through the grapevine you think i'm you know we're trying to get to know  you again when we first started on xm in mornings he would come in and just continue to drinking uh  uh continue drinking like we were still doing our afternoon show and he's like man you guys have

[02:15:30]  ben against the wall it really was hold on where is ben by the way i want to make sure everyone knows ben  ben didn't do no ben didn't do anything ben didn't spit on anybody move out of the way of the  doorway where's ben oh he's talking to the cops ben's talking to the cops what how he said he said  ben spit on the thing is they were face to face how could ben spit on them when they're face to face  nobody spit on the dude no one spit on him he took ben by the shoulders and threw him against uh one of the 
[02:16:00]  walls of the building and that's when uh kenny and poe complete that guy was immobilized in seconds  in a fraction of a second he was immobilized apologizing yeah i mean that was uh he did put  his hands on bed and nobody was going to stop him from talking no i love that he was talking he was  burying himself it was funny to watch him running out of steam hey you well howard i gotta go to work  i realized it was a real bad idea he thought he was gonna be all tough and then yeah he was so 
[02:16:30]  intimidated it wasn't even funny just all your fans he wanted to rip up that poster but he didn't  oh he certainly did he kept looking at eyeing uh trying to figure out what the move certainly  wanted to rip that one up and try to run or something oh what an ass that guy looked like  an ass on every level yeah he verbally physically everything just didn't work out for him i think  he better rethink any plan he has in the future to do something like that yeah he got ripped apart  verbally he wasn't able to like verbally spar with anybody and then when he he pushed poor ben 
[02:17:00]  ben's had a ben's hung over today let's just be truthful yeah then went out drinking last night  he's not at his best and he gets thrown against the wall by some asshole god but to see poe work like  that well kenny i gotta say kenny jumped in first kenny jumped in oh but poe had the guy on the ground  in one of those hoist gracie holes dude i felt that guy couldn't fucking move he couldn't move  you know if he wanted to kenny and poe have finally bonded by the way oh my god you're 
[02:17:30]  bonding a little ass kicking they bonded finally there's been this weird tension between those  two i don't think anymore man you see how fat like you understand how how badly they can really hurt  you if there's a problem oh that was very impressive to watch he was so i'm amazed again at how completely  immobilized he was the guy didn't have the power to move a pinky yeah and poe didn't uh you know really  hurt him no he held him down he put him down the guy was being violent towards uh uh ben  fucking ben ben is about i don't know about a hundred feet away from us all i see is him laughing 
[02:18:00]  he's laughing laughing don't push me don't don't don't kenny and poe dude it was great  wow and then wow it's pretty much telling them having the guy beg for mercy man yes  why would you put your hands on somebody it's just silly okay i like when he goes i'm gonna let  you up if you try anything you're going down again and the guy's like all right all right all right

[02:24:00]  also this guy walks through the the crowd and gets right up to us and then the guy holding the huge  poster i thought he was a listener i thought he was around at first and then it was obvious he was a  howard fan immediately i knew what he was he knew you guys were of course no i knew he asked me  so is this opian anthony oh okay so yeah he was uh scoping us out he just wanted something to call  in with well you know what i did call yeah yeah yeah you got you got thrown down you got thrown down  and completely immobilized and you apologized and apologized oh they made him oh that was the guy's

[02:25:30]  guy could not do anything else but apologize mobilized the only thing the guy had the power  to do was say i'm sorry any any he patted them down a little bit to make sure he didn't have any  weapons in his pocket he asked him if he had any weapons the guy just grabbed ben and threw him  against the wall there was like see master poe but these people don't understand we got master poe  club sort of kenny steve who's just a psychopath steve was right in the guy's face as well yeah and then  i was here he wanted to get involved steven lynch of course steven lynch started dancing uh in front

[02:31:30]  times where we had poe come into this studio pissed him off with to demonstrate no to demonstrate with  people that like a student of his and he gets himself in this like zone and he demonstrates without  doing full contact and then he goes back into his office and he'll go like almost get in the lotus  position like his hands will be kind of uh interlace the fingers and he shuts his eyes and just sits  in and someone asked what he's doing he goes i really have to wind down from these things and this  is a demonstration do you know what he's going to have to do to wind down from what just happened

[02:33:30]  punching out guys later all right i'm sure that means something one more dave in tennessee dave  what's up hey that shit was so funny man that was like a sniper attack we're sitting here listening  radio boom he's down you're hollering motherfucker it did happen real fast yeah like it went from  very civil like no let him talk let him say what he got to say and then he got like he got all angry  it was it was the line where he said uh well you guys rip off howard and i said yeah we ripped off 
[02:34:00]  all of his radio stations and he got and then everyone started laughing he got really mad that  he didn't have a comeback yeah he did the fake laugh thought he was gonna thought it and then he's  like what's that with the poster and like hope said he was gonna rip up the poster he didn't have  the ball he wasn't gonna rip it up he was looking at it he wanted to but there was no way and then  he decided he was going to grab ben by his uh lapel i started nodding toward the poster like come  on go ahead yeah you know what i was looking right in the eyes like i know what you want to do go go  i was i was gesturing toward the post you know it's amazing though it's right next to you go ahead 
[02:34:30]  ben's shirt was actually less wrinkled after the guy grabbed it and threw him against the wall  than it was when he came in this morning to thank you and trying to explain to the officers  why there's white like powder all over his shirt what were you holding in there son  not there must be laundry detergent time dude that was really the john hinckley moment there  you guys all that pushed into the limo that was it poe went into action poe went right into action  wow uh that's something do we have the audio you want where do you want to pick this audio up from 
[02:35:00]  man oh please pick it up from the six o'clock hour yeah no kidding no kidding how about uh  pick it up right from the moment i i decided to walk away and miss it yeah and miss the whole  thing because that's when everything happens pick it up uh as we're walking up the street and we see  the guy with the big poster because we were into something we're having fun and then it was yeah  show that we were having the poster the poster i think i've ruined everything oh  fucking mush mouth boob i wish he was still here so just in case you you missed it you're just tuning 
[02:35:30]  in well uh there's a little i actually walked away when the guy was making the illegal three-point  turn and that was yeah okay energy and i was just like okay you thought that was going to be it  they're yelling at people in traffic yeah this doesn't feel like a day where something's going  to happen i think i'll mosey and you mosey'd see then it missed the whole thing you're still  looking for that i think yeah i just uh it never fails i can't find shit i was just looking for the  um the poe theme oh there it is thank you right where it says poe all right uh you inspire me when you 
[02:36:00]  come in come in is what it is still no where's steve get steve in here okay this is what i want  to hear how great is this the poems blazing out okay i'm sorry i'm sorry i'm sorry okay no i don't  have weapons i don't have weapons he went into the crane position i've seen people get their ass kicked  but i've never seen anybody have to like i have to apologize over the radio you know getting this 
[02:36:30]  kicked out it's because me and ovi had mics in his face and it was like apologize you asshole  did i oh oh who made it apologize i don't know it was either me or ovi i thought it would be very  degrading to have him apologize uh i i blanked out and i think an apology was due you don't push around  ben sparks like that that's right steve what's going on yeah um so from your vantage point what  from my vantage point the guy just spun around and uh got ben in a it looked like he started to

[03:04:00]  are starting for us one of the abominable soccer team we have i i didn't even know we had a bad  soccer team it's awful larry flint is the goalie they were talking i thought they did the world cup  every year every four years apparently i don't know who knows who cares unless you're one of  those oh yes if your foreskin's been removed you don't care about soccer that's just the way it  works so uh there's a lot of action still on the street oh yeah and that's all we know right now 
[03:04:30]  yep we're waiting for updates people hustling bustling on their way to work we're waiting for  updates and we're not getting any so is this guy calling in for global warming yeah that should be  an interesting segue this is the guy that uh put out that movie what is this tech uh text message from  i don't know elo elo elo is it elo about my raise 
[03:05:00]  oh that's great what nothing what song is that my girlfriend now officially thinks i'm scary great  oh good took that long really that didn't give her confidence that you're uh you're a man of  response that's wonderful after somebody else responded yeah  he's the national guard talking after the marines sweeping

[03:06:00]  where do we go where do we go now what are you going to play to tennis i saw that on the email  yesterday today what happened aren't you watching tennis or something one of these  no we're watching world cup soccer you're joking right no  yesterday i got the email the mass email i don't i didn't i honest to god i got a man  it's not a massive u.s open yeah yeah oh the golf boy that's the same thing iraq thought i thought  tennis you said u.s open i hope he said he was going to the u.s open 
[03:06:30]  and iraq uh thought he'd be nice to open and told him bring some suntan uh uh some sunscreen  because the sun reflecting off the clay quartz and he was serious serious like now and we killed  him for 20 minutes so oh no i didn't hear it it's the golf that's why i wasn't sure if you were going  with the uh the iraq abuse or whatever no no i just remember was that yesterday or today uh yes i had a  great time great time man it was a lot of fun we have a golf channel on xm xm 146 is doing the u.s  open coverage and those guys are really cool it looks like they love to drink the wedding singer

[03:15:30]  well paul mercurio uh... took your place that day my friend yeah you had to be i don't know in michigan  or something doing some kind of play i think you were doing this you'll have to pull over i  gotta take a leak yeah you guys have made amends over yeah leave the gun take the take the playbill  we got britney spears on dateline where's that clip we're having fun with yesterday oh yeah we got  that lower one because we were getting to the one about uh we're finally getting to where she cries but uh 
[03:16:00]  britney does yeah why it's the one of those kids which one though did she hear her husband trying to  talk like a fucking like a black person and just get in paris and weep they uh they uh i actually  fucked this guy yo what's up what's up yuck do that they do a good job of crying  they try to make her cry okay that's danny this clip you gotta hear jimmy they try to make her cry 
[03:16:30]  yeah matt lauer's like they say britney spears is no they don't say is what it is what it's not that  they're saying okay yeah you know they're calling you a bad parent and it's like well i'm not because  you know bad parent that's because it's not like they're saying right you can't sing you're there  and so like yesterday we just like went through a laundry it's not like they're saying your big fat  pregnant face isn't attractive anymore it's not like they're saying it's not like they're saying  that once fine ass is just a stretched out mess of blubber it's not like they're not saying your 
[03:17:00]  trl days are a decade way behind you what they're saying is no one's implying that your beautiful body  was destroyed by wigger seed no one is saying that and that's exactly what he's doing  oh what the incident no way it says the incident has made all access dot com how does that happen  no go to all access no way what what what what what what you know it's on youtube already what 
[03:17:30]  what what that's of course on the new york radio message board is it somebody picked up on the fact  i didn't even think of that that kid said howard stern has a huge cock and i love him yeah yeah  well that was the call that was the the battle cry of the guy outside all right see we're trying to  do more material and we can't what i want to hear the britney stuff yeah we will where's that is  finding the clip he might have to re-burn it real quick oh he's gonna re-burn it why these are all new 
[03:18:00]  clips yes okay tell danny to speed up before he gets a backhand across his face now let the slap danny  well now we're distracted go to uh net net news or something like that all right all right  smack his dumb face  when is this guy calling you if someone asked uh can they can ona ever stay out of trouble  and people are like it's what trouble the the producer was grabbed what are you talking  yeah stop blaming the victim and where's that on new york radio message board i i can't find uh 
[03:18:30]  anything no no no do this all access oh yeah anything we do anything we're involved in stern  fan on a scuffle on the walk from free fm to xm a stern fan started mouthing off to ona and then  and their fans that were following them the stern fan grabbed ona's producer ben and was taken down  to the ground by security all this was broadcast live on their xm show police are now involved can 
[03:19:00]  these two ever stay out of trouble these two handle themselves very well as did the fucking security  and everybody else no one stomped the guy well might have those hot 97 he would have had his  teeth would have been kicked out he would have been shot no kidding that's true this is what happens  excuse me this is what happens with white stations there's a scuffle security takes somebody down and  holds them there and says you're gonna behave that's what happens there's no fucking hip-hop wars no one gets  shot no lives have been threatened just the guy guy's a douche he gets out of hand he gets thrown 
[03:19:30]  down that's the end of it uh can these two ever stay out of trouble hold on from what you said they  were walking and a stern fan grabbed their producer so how is that their fault or them being in trouble  it seems like the stern fan is the one who caused the incident uh from what you wrote okay he just  couldn't handle being laughed at like that and that's what was happening yeah that kind of got him a  little dude we're not gonna get angry about that stuff again it's not larry king 1991 no one gives a  shit and then another one that's a stupid question how are ona in trouble when someone 
[03:20:00]  some idiot on the street assaults their producer when stern was accosting on the street several  months ago and and it made all the papers did you comment that he was in trouble here's the uh oh  sorry here's the uh all access uh howard stern fan allegedly oh they use the words allegedly and  stuff allegedly grabbed and pushed ovian anthony executive producer ben sparks against the wall  during ona's daily walk over friday between the shows uh fm and xm studios the fan who initially  was permitted to say pro stern anti ona comments on the air but ran out of things to say claimed that 
[03:20:30]  sparks spat on him a claim denied by sparks and ona who noted that the incident was caught on tape  the stern fan was subdued by security guard master po anthony's anthony cumia's comments on po you do not  screw with him and comic policeman security guard john club so to kenny fetter get out of here  what it says while opie stuck the microphone in the man's face and profanely demanded and received 
[03:21:00]  an apology the incident was the first case of the walkover being interrupted by a stern fan since ona  began terrestrial radio crossover april 26 best walkover ever opie producer uh pronounced uh once the  crew made it to the xm how accurate is that though the guy was permitted to say what he wanted on the  air and he was oh yeah he was permitted no one's gonna fucking cry about it here he ran out of  gas run out of steam stupid go ahead wow yap until you fucking sputter oh boy that's only that it's  ran out of steam and the ability to stand upright just an asshole just an asshole it's only in a couple 
[03:21:30]  places it's no big deal yeah this this doesn't seem like it's gonna go anywhere this won't have any  legs no i don't think it'll go viral whatsoever that's it won't go anywhere that's just silly to think  that maybe pete popolardo could call him with another fun update on tickets guys we're at five  and then what what okay all right thank you it's you know not like the press uh likes writing anything  that involves both us and howard in some way shape or form no i don't think that'll happen not at all 
[03:22:00]  that would be silly okay all right let's uh move on your britney spears on dateline last night they're  burning the cliff i really want to play but let's start with by the way i've really had enough of jack  black i don't hate him don't hate him but i'm sick of looking at him notch nacho libre oh how awful  that must be everywhere i look is his fucking fat face and i'm tired of it new york papers three stars  two and a half stars two and a half stars i think okay out of four he used to do our show by the way  when he looks like ben if ben cleaned up jack used to do it doesn't look like ben jack's another one

[03:25:30]  and number one and he only did three days did three days with us was it three or two two and a  half three whatever i don't even i don't even know i think it was only two with nine dumps ladies and  gentlemen bill burr thank you thanks a lot who will be at caroline's all weekend long wow what a  potty mouth you really are 31 i had nine i only had two today hey guys we got a big star on the line  here uh yes what smoothie it's too late for a smoothie it's not no i want a smoothie i don't want 
[03:26:00]  a smoothie i'd like one a little late too late for a smoothie now god kenny uh about an hour and a  half late for smoothies what are you doing well fucking off yeah what what the hell have you been  doing for the last hour who's on the phone uh we got davis uh guggenheim yes davis guggenheim  is on the phone hello sir davis hello good morning the executive producer of the new moon uh no no  what uh are you the executive producer with the al gore movie uh director director i'm sorry yeah i i 
[03:26:30]  went uh down uh one line too many i'm sorry an inconvenient uh truth in theaters now can you  explain the whole dump thing we're on uh uh nah we uh we do commercial radio as well now okay yeah  first half of the show is on commercial radio and it's uh it's simulcast xm and then uh we do just  xm stuff for two hours so sometimes potty mouth people have to be dumped out of but right now we  are on the exclusive xm side so let them fly if uh they feel like you they'll make your point got it 
[03:27:00]  i'm very jealous that you're married to elizabeth shu really yeah she's great man well you can try  it for a day and then tell me what you think oh wow hey i like that yes wow she's uh she's actually  nine months pregnant she's due any day now oh wow why would you together uh 16 years why would you  bring another child into a world that you seem to think is doomed within a week or two uh good point  uh uh you know it's pretty terrifying the global warming thing but uh if you see the movie you see 
[03:27:30]  that there's a it's it's pretty hopeful if we all sort of start working on it now if we start working  on it now right now that means cutting down on our use of fossil fuels yeah i mean it's it's not just  one thing it's a bunch of things it's a bunch of things because i i had a point steve c who works  here with us is a huge fan of the movie um he he drives a hybrid vehicle uh he's a tree hugger he's 
[03:28:00]  gay no he is not but there would be nothing wrong with that if he was cuddly bear that he is and um  it seems to be uh one thing that we're running out of oil and suv and collects guns we're running out of  oil right yeah and the oil's bad and and and is ruining our environment and will lead to um  a cataclysmic end of everything as we know it uh but but and the oil comes from a very dangerous 
[03:28:30]  place and we gotta send soldiers there yeah but the thing is if we're run out of oil doesn't that  solve the problem either we're running out of oil i could see now if there was so much oil that oh my  god for thousands of years we're going to be using this stuff and you know change the planet but  if we're running out then we'll have to come up with something different and problem solved well  you know it's the problem is it's a it's a multi-faceted problem and i'm i'm i'm not an  expert on this i'm a filmmaker but it's also coal you know uh yeah coal-fired plants are some of the 
[03:29:00]  dirtiest polluters weren't we using a lot more coal back in like the 20s and 30s yeah i think the bigger  problem is yes you know we're we're burning too much oil we're also burning too much coal but  basically we're just consuming uh at any way we like isn't that kind of our job though as inhabitants  of top of the food chain on the planet like doesn't the plan i see this planet as like hours for as long 
[03:29:30]  as it'll have us no matter what we do like there really isn't anything we can do to stretch our time  here a little longer maybe we can cut it a little shorter it's like it's like anybody else you know  that's like that's like it was when i was uh you know in college and we go you know for a keg party  and we'd have 40 bucks and we buy all donuts and we just go the weekend and drink all weekend and  by the end you'd end up with nothing you didn't think about like perhaps that maybe you needed some  other type of food for the weekend and you didn't quite take care of the place you were staying yeah i i 
[03:30:00]  was in the same boat as you you described exactly that but hey look where we are now yeah i mean  but the thing is a better place they're really simple things that you can do yeah that actually make  your life better are they simple or inconvenient they're inconvenient that's why the movie is called  an inconvenient truth but it actually you know i'm not an environmentalist you talk about tree  hugger i'm just not that kind of guy yeah i'm i but i and i went to gore gorg gives this thing live 
[03:30:30]  and i went to see it and uh it just blew my mind because um how powerful no uh the subject is and how  you know how i just didn't get it i thought i knew a little bit about it i didn't get it before davis i  have a question for you because a friend of mine knows a lot about this um and he was saying something  along the lines of like a lot there's a lot of alternative energy methods which are available  but it just seems that people for some reason are always going with the older way and it's like 
[03:31:00]  without without using the newer sources uh it just it kind of contributes and yet it makes the whole  thing like a little bit more difficult yeah look at it this way you know you mentioned that like the  the the the party we've had with oil is about to end it's just all the indicators are there  right yeah you know and and this has been you know america has really uh been at the top of  this game for a long time and you know it's gonna end and someone some country's gonna come up with 
[03:31:30]  the next thing and if it's china you know they come up with the next fuel source they'll just burn  humans oh that's their big resource baby but the point is is that you know why don't we focus our  energies on figuring out what the next thing is well i've heard rumors really that the party's over  you know i've heard rumors that there's been like vehicles that run on alternative fuel and that a lot  of times what will happen is that the big companies will like try to like get the patents but like it's 
[03:32:00]  kind of hard to like release it without that you know there's a lot there's a lot of theories about  that and i'm not an expert and some of them sound like you know you know conspiracy stuff yeah but i do  know that you know when we had our our film came out this this uh institute in washington which we  found out later was funded by exxon mobil put out these ads and the ad said something to the effect of  co2 they call it pollution we call it life and the point is they were just trying to keep the 
[03:32:30]  controversy going because they don't want change you know and they want to keep making their money  there needs to be change it's all about the almighty dollar but does no we're not spending  any time or energy towards figuring out what these new things are do you think if we ran out of oil as  a country that we would just start walking around in loincloths and and not be able to figure out  another way to uh to do things an alternative source i don't you slowly see that there is sort of this 
[03:33:00]  migration towards alternate fuel sources now with uh that uh the ethanol and uh corn-based uh fuels  and and all this that it is happening well my wife you know what we uh there's a there's a biodiesel  pump near our house and she's like well there's a biodiesel pump how come there's not more cars doing  it well it's like well because if you drive 50 miles away you're running out of gas how are you going to  fill your car up exactly there's not enough the point is that there's a whole system that is locked 
[03:33:30]  in step but that'll change when it really needs to right now we kind of have enough but there's  got to be more right well come i mean that's where we disagree is that i think you know the  thought the writing has been on the wall for a while now you know and uh if you see the movie you see that  because we're putting so much co2 in the air the world is changing really rapidly in a terrifying  pace bottom line davis time to move and get it done right yeah and you know you go to the movie 
[03:34:00]  you go to this movie inconvenient truth you go to our website climatecrisis.net and you'll learn a lot  about it and i think you you and your listeners would say oh okay this isn't as complicated as i  thought it's not as it's real it's urgent what do what would you say but you got to get big  business on the same page don't you what's that you got to get big business on the same page big  business big business uh ge you got the college kids that's easy general electric has uh the  head of general electric uh a couple months ago said that he thinks that green is green which means 
[03:34:30]  that they're going to focus their technologies and millions of dollars on research towards green  technology well yeah you know um bp british petroleum is out there advertising how to reduce  your carbon your carbon so you know it's it's it's things are changing our companies like exxon  mobile man they're just stuck in place you know what can what do you think the average joe can do the  number one thing that the average joe could do to help a john q citizen what can you write well you go on 
[03:35:00]  our website right yeah and there's a thing called a carbon calculator oh uh-oh yeah i know it sounds  complicated but what what you do is you look and you see how the choices you make in your life  create carbon like the car you drive or the air conditioning i'd like to take this test  yeah i bet i scored pretty high yeah but you guys you know i mean you got a pretty cynical attitude  about this but the point is is that if you wake up to this and you say look this is this is a real 
[03:35:30]  problem and i'm part of it you know then you can say look this is a pretty easy way to do it i bought  up i used to drive a big tahoe a chevy tahoe now i have a prius see and my prius how does that make  you feel doesn't that make you feel like perhaps you've emasculated yourself a bit it's a fantastic  car it's married to elizabeth's shoe i know i only drive cars that chicks like i have a caddy because  chicks like it what does it cost to fill up your tank two thousand dollars it's almost right mine is 
[03:36:00]  less than 20 bucks and it goes 450 miles it's unbelievable wow yeah but it's a  new piece of technology and i look at these jackasses driving suvs exactly exactly thank you  sir thank you sir you're talking to mr jackass right and i and in two years i drive the cadillac of  suvs right what's that two years ago i was driving a big tahoe so i was one of those jackasses right  yeah i'm just saying that there's a you know there's a there's a flip and suddenly you go oh okay 
[03:36:30]  this isn't so hard i think it's just people who drive big trucks like that i think and i think  you'll agree there's a self-centeredness in it they're only concerned about themselves and the  way things used to be in the 40s and like they're not really concerned with the rest of the environment  well look i i bought a sdv because i have little kids and i i don't want to get in a wreck with a  suburban yeah i see there you go right so i had a real reason to do it and you know and it's fun to drive  they're fantastic cars yeah see what i'm doing i'm burning the fuel up quicker so we have to find 
[03:37:00]  an alternative if you people that drive the the priuses if everybody did that there'd be fossil  fuel burning for years and years and years longer than it should be yeah and i'm helping it was  interesting how you were saying that the um because of where the oil is located how the problem is really  islam i mean that was actually a good point you made oh jesus i don't think he said that you don't  you don't want to be in uh that uh jesus jimmy where is the problem uh as far as where they're 
[03:37:30]  drilling let me ask you guys a question have any of you guys seen the film uh yes steve c saw it  who has been talking to you uh over here yes because the way you're talking about it sounds  like it's some sort of tree-hugging environmentalist no no not a raw raw thing i just think if al gore's  involved it must be well you know when you most people have that expectation but you know i think  uh when you go see it you realize it's actually not one of these you know one of these uh finger 
[03:38:00]  pointing michael moore films i'm gonna go see it i'm gonna go is that true is that is that a fair  assessment yeah i i actually do i i enjoyed it and i do think that it's it's a fair i don't think it's  tree-hugging or any of that stuff it's just it seems like it would be on the surface just because  of the title and what it's about but then you get into it and you realize it's a legitimate problem  now gore right people actually find it funny and they find it um entertaining in there and  they and they're they come out kind of charged up they're not it's not like the end of the world  movie i don't know from the trailer it looked like you know the quick images of you know trees and 
[03:38:30]  then a nuclear power plant and gas and stuff i'm like ah no no no no no no kind of scary oh no no  steve no no no no no no it's not like that no it's not that's just that was the previews oh  okay that was for the omen it's it's actually you know you know you're looking at the rock movie  trailer yeah yeah yeah they are they're running out of fuel that big gorilla's climbing a building  how is that going to help us wrong movie stupid all right i know the movie now i'm gonna check it  out i'm definitely out yeah we're gonna check out the movie there davis yeah it is a legitimate 
[03:39:00]  problem i mean uh we got to do something about it so i mean i've heard the film is actually really  good well thank you i mean i'm just uh what state do we lose first though underwater florida florida's  got to go first right uh there are a bunch of them in fact my neighbor i live in california my  neighbor in venice is going underwater uh the uh southern half of florida the cape um and then you  got um you got cities like in um beijing it's unbelievable how about like michigan like off of 
[03:39:30]  lake michigan yeah there's gonna be more storms there's gonna be more erratic weather i mean i think  everyone must feel like that the weather is just going on crazy this sounds good the arctic  ocean could be ice free by the summer 2050 that sounds good yeah vacation so there's there's um  you know yeah it's it's uh the problem is is that it's not just things gradually getting warmer  no it's davis you sound defeated i mean let's let's let's go in inside the interview a little 
[03:40:00]  bit are you feeling a little defeated uh talking to you guys yeah yeah i hear you gulping and getting  a little uncomfortable he's a director and a fine one i personally uh will be checking out the film  that's for sure i sound like a uh i think the point i think the point i like though is that you're  saying it's not like a michael moore film and all that a tree hugging type of film you guys are taking  a different approach and it appeals to reasonable people we showed this film to reasonable people  a group of evangelical ministers you know these guys who are sided with the with the white house on 
[03:40:30]  and energy policy uh-huh and they and they they love the film yeah you know the film plays to you  know you know reasonable people you know it's not it's not like a totally we're all gonna die it's  like this is the situation and this is what you can do to fix it i can imagine people seeing it and  saying oh this is one of you know putting in a box and saying this is al gore and this is a political  yeah do you leave us with a little hope at the end of the film like yeah i mean the uh the film  actually the end of the film is very uplifting and it and it leaves you with very simple things 
[03:41:00]  you can do all right now i bring canvas bags to the supermarket and i don't use those little  plastic ones is is that a good thing is that does that knock down my uh co2 consumption  i lost you you're you're fading out he actually brings bags with him canvas bags to the supermarket  so when they say paper plastic he goes neither and i already have and he brings them and you  you know uses them instead of the plastic of paper so i'm sure that's just helping out 
[03:41:30]  that sounds a little gay to me oh yeah thank god thank you davis now we like you now we thank god  what a creep you must look like marching out those empty bags oh yeah i look like a bag lady  i shouldn't have said that no you were completely correct fine i like the honesty no you gave you  gave into it you what you got you became weak i was trying to side with you and what's  saying you threw me under the bus what's it i'm uh i'm gonna go see the only one voice i can't hear  for some reason no bill is gay it's no big deal what oh i know why this should be down probably oh 
[03:42:00]  that uh what city uh did you say is in deep trouble it's uh it's sinking and all that beijing  what city beijing yeah what's the deal with beijing well all these low-lying countries like the  netherlands right yeah they're more affected by sea level rise so you know if the if half of  greenland and half of antarctica melts sea level rise is predicted to go up 20 feet yeah but then  uh you know the gondola business will uh explode true uh yeah i think if you take lemons i think 
[03:42:30]  it's good logic i can't argue with that gondola business with the guys with the big sticks and then  and they get to dress nice too wouldn't we just evolve into something with gills yeah if too much  of the planet becomes water we just all of a sudden uh or water world you know i'm sure you would have  directed that they're still alive he could tell us what to do you uh you guys got a good point i  can't argue with you all the girls would look like daryl hannah more importantly 
[03:43:00]  i think after this interview davis is going out and getting his suburban  pack he's like yeah come pick up your escalator something i  yeah you guys are right i love it no davis you're right i'm uh screw this  yeah i appreciate it thanks for uh hanging in there with us it's davis uh guggenheim  sorry guggenheim and inconvenient truth is in theaters now i'll definitely check it out  yeah check it out go to our website climatecrisis.net okay and uh uh it's it's it's worth looking at  all right right on man thanks guys thank you so much all right you know i was so hoping that they  were going to bring on an actual expert so he could go back he's an expert on directing and he's just 
[03:43:30]  like uh i really don't know what the fuck my movie's about i was ready to start asking him about  because he directed uh a season of deadwood i was gonna start asking him about that all i wanted to  ask him about was elizabeth elizabeth she was hiney and how good it looked in leaving las vegas oh  yeah there you go holy god was she sexy in that doesn't look that good anymore jesus christ dude  oh i'm sure why would you say i might be just a guest of seconds ago on our program and you're  insulting his wife i think his wife is finn pregnant wife dude you got to go to whackbag.com they got

[03:45:30]  now you're calling me like one of the midwestern kind of exactly no i was being  i was being reasonable i was bringing up conveniences  that this century living living in this century affords us  and if it's screw if it fucks up the environment and the earth they'll figure it out down the line  in the future they'll figure it out they figure it out that's what anthony said look what happened  back in like the 1700s the 1800s there were things that they were doing that were screwing up what we  do now uh how we live now look at slavery that's screwed up what we do now didn't it yeah but it also

[03:49:00]  what is it about kevin that makes you love him it's very simple women complicate everything  he's so simple his simplicity and nice compliment he's like a a boy he just you know and he's he  cares you know he cares so much and his his heart is awesome he has a really big heart  for the lack of she's losing her mind that could be the worst description of why you like somebody 
[03:49:30]  i've ever heard he's simple he's like a child yeah he's like a boy she does describe someone but  downs even braun had nicer things to say about hitler well he laughs in game shows loves the dog  his mustache is awesome yeah he always has pit stains through three shirts and a nazi jacket which  i kind of dig i think it's cute all right here we go sweaty out off the next clip you're not gonna  believe this one i'm thinking about waiting like a year or two to come out with music again we'll see 
[03:50:00]  it's just i feel like i want my boo-boos to be a little bit older because when i do music i want to  do it for real and i want to travel and i just want to make sure they're old enough to be able to  be on that kind of pace love me she wants her boo-boos or boo-boos her boo-boos are kids like like  she's picking up on some of the uh great street slang that's great because your boob boobs are going to  get older and saggier that's what i thought if i have yeah and that'll help take a sale because 
[03:50:30]  because they're really going there for your voice britney yeah everyone wants to see old chicken neck  tits saggy saggy boobs and lasagna belly that's great that should be the name of her next album  by the way it is soccer mom torso uh she talks about being southern here it seemed for a while  people would describe you they'd say she's this great young thing from the south you know small 
[03:51:00]  town girl i know i know but but then all of a sudden okay but then all of a sudden voice they  started to use that southern background in a different way the tone of it changed all of a  sudden they make you feel like you have to have your transformation well madonna reinvent yourself right  right but they started saying maybe she's a little bit of a redneck you started to hear that it wasn't a  good thing that all of a sudden it wasn't a good thing your roots they started to try and make it a 
[03:51:30]  negative thing how do you feel about that i think anybody who's doing well in the public eye or  whatever there's always going to be a shift because people don't want to see somebody happy all the  time and they're going to try to take shots at people you know they did the same thing to goldie  hon when she did her show good example before she did private and all that and then all of a sudden  she became like this oh my god she's a star you know um but they still gave her flack for her past  same thing with evil is the term by you when you hear redneck because it's not used in a gretchen  wilson proud of well it's not used that way it and i think that's just cruel you know i think that's 
[03:52:00]  cruelty when you when you um judge people and so trying to get i'm not a bible belt but i just  you know i feel like when you put labels on people like that and you do that  at the end of the day they're just words and that's what i have to look at them i mean i have  you have to be really strong you know and just be like if that's what you want to say then you know okay  god damn rich cunt 
[03:52:30]  and by the way i want to point out this stupid matt lauer if she was black do you really think if they  were saying that they were trying to imply that you're like a jigaboo do you really think he would  go that fucking with anyone but a white performer no of course he was trying to say that the southern  roots when she was first getting into the business was kind of endearing southern bell and yeah and  then it turned into what he wouldn't say white trash that's what they're calling her redneck  that's like saying if you're a black performer they kind of like your street roots but now they  think you're kind of sambo-ish right never would they go there with anybody but a white 
[03:53:00]  performer we're looking for white people  it's actually a testament to white people still being completely in charge and still being paternalistic  we're also looking at the end of her career it's very obvious oh maybe a year two years  top a big two years that lumpy end of her career debbie gibson what about her debbie gibson went on  to broadway didn't she stephen lynch uh expert of all things yeah right now yes that's true  i'll speak for steve started uh beauty of the beast in 19 uh yeah are you gonna do uh broadway bears 
[03:53:30]  this year yeah got my spangly g-string  poor steven no i don't even know poor steven he's in a hit show on broadway you can tell though  i don't care that he doesn't want to do it i don't want to do it no i love it what are you  talking about look at him i want to i want to ask steven he wants out i want to ask steven what do you  think of of debbie gibson wow but i mean that in the nicest way james that's the greatest clip  ever got steven everyone's probably so proud of you you're like father frank the priest in the 
[03:54:00]  saturday night fever tony's brother father frank and you'll come home you want to quit and you'll  come home he'll go back to the show he'll go back to the show what did you say to steven about the  show i didn't say nothing oh you're trying to blame this on me now is that what you're doing  he'll go he'll go back it's a phase he'll sing he'll dance he'll go back too good all right  i have to i signed the contract spears is so done now here's uh well she loves being a housewife 
[03:54:30]  and loves to cook and clean everyone although she's not desperate she's a housewife through and  through i like to cook um try to cook and i like to clean that's i clean and i'm obsessive like that  and i like to um if i watch tv i do watch the home uh redoing the house whole thing and i get into like  redoing my living room and the baby's room and all that so do you clean the house by yourself 
[03:55:00]  yes i have a maid that comes once a week but she slacks a little bit but um so if i were to come  here and ring the doorbell by surprise i could get you vacuuming doing the toilets doing the laundry  everything mm-hmm see there's a side of you we didn't know oh honey that is the real me honey i  pictured there'd be housekeepers around here no i mean this house is so big i have to have some help  that voice oh my god it's so bad now you know why kevin now now you know why kevin's out there  prowling he thought he thought he was getting the britney spears that's up on that stage every night 
[03:55:30]  yep shaking it that's why he's prowling he's gotta stop knocking her up yeah he's the one blowing her  out dude you don't give a shit he got with britney when while the other one was what eight eight  nine months pregnant yeah that's why he doesn't give a shit he shouldn't be putting out an album he  should be writing a book i'm sure that's kind of reverse uh gold digging reverse gold digging  how to fuck up a hot body well we got some great stories of her falling with the kid one we never  heard of before his heart is just awesome i want to hear a cry yeah we're getting there we're almost 
[03:56:00]  there spears hospital story when her baby fell out of a high chair she can't she can't  she can't keep the baby in her arms just a few weeks after the baby in the lap incident britney's  son while in the care of a nanny fell out of a high chair and banked his head you took him to  the doctor he's like oh yeah so you walked into the hospital and said he bumped his head fell out  of a high chair and then the doctors acted really funny with me i know it was really bizarre how they 
[03:56:30]  act funny um funny how hit him i don't want to say but she doesn't sound she sounds fucked up a little  crazy well she's she's not that bright but every baby falls they make it seem like there's an incident  like the kid tumbled is it true that he had too many cookies fucking the kids fall stupid and this  one's falling a lot or almost falling a lot um i don't want to say but they did suspicious 
[03:57:00]  um suspicious i don't want to say what they did or what they said um consequences it was really  really bad do you know britney that because of those questions that were asked after that picture  on pacific coast highway with sean in your lap that the doctor in that emergency room or that  hospital said wait a second maybe i have a bad mom on my hands i was just happy that my son was okay  and i wanted to get home and get out of the voice yeah and then she sounded jody foster going not long  after that you got a visit from the family services people yeah and which actually they felt really bad 
[03:57:30]  about it they said we don't even know why we're here so in other words they came because it's their job to  come they have to investigate that's the way of getting answered by the way i made them come  because i didn't bring my doctor there confident same thing they said the steinberg house because  you're a celebrity that you're taking care of more in some situations people you're not it you get it  worse yeah uh let's go to denise in jersey so trying to make her cry yeah denise hey hey guys how are you 
[03:58:00]  hey um did you did you enjoy the fact that she looked like she had marshmallows stuffed in her  face the whole interview and her chin goes right into her neck now yeah you women out there must love  that oh yeah going to shit the women must love it all looking at hey honey your girlfriend's on the  television maybe i'll come in here and take a look oh is it oh jesus where are you now yeah where are you  now all right very good observation boy did she go downhill fast yeah she's like jake lamana all of 
[03:58:30]  a sudden what happened to her it ain't the thing it's the ring on my baby fell why'd you put the  baby where it's not gonna fall well these are the these are the fingers from the baby stupid ass  we're almost up to britney crying and just days after that photo appeared on a visit to new york city  britney stumbled again what happened this time literally you're walking with with sean in one  arm and you tripped on what was your pants um i think actually i didn't trip on anything there was 
[03:59:00]  it was new york street just cobblestones and i was walking and i only was prepared with one security  because i've never had that much paparazzi ever on me in new york so we didn't even know there was  gonna be that many people so i think it was a mixture of so many paparazzi and just how  the road was all messed up me just trying to get in the car it was a close call i mean it seemed as  it for a second you know accidents happen hey and where's it and where's matt with the questions 
[03:59:30]  she says cobblestones there's no cobblestones it was very obvious in the in the video it said it's  a paved street cobblestones cobblestones years he lived yeah where is she what happened a chimney sweep  whisked by in his carriage i hit a buckboard well apparently a negro had made eye contact to the  white woman and the police were chasing him i was knocked over accidents happen hi oh yeah  here's britney crying finally good what do you think it'll take to get the paparazzi to leave you alone 
[04:00:00]  um 40 i don't know  why 40 more pounds  she's gunning for it i'm good one they're going away fast britney don't worry and then you're gonna  wish they were following you what do you think it'll take to get the paparazzi to leave you alone  um i don't know i don't know 
[04:00:30]  i'm gonna cry please cry  maybe you should put down the papa tartsy  no i thought that would get her crying is that one of your biggest wishes joke here we go  come on yeah  success there you go matt  that's all he wanted that's all he wanted right there that was pathetic he'll make believe he didn't 
[04:01:00]  want that of course probably even give her the tissue after she starts crying yeah yeah  it's okay i would like that that's getting aroused if you could talk to them as individuals not as a  group yeah yeah what would you say to them this will work i would just say that  you have babies at home and you have 
[04:01:30]  you have a wife and if you don't you have to realize that we're people and that we need we just need  privacy and we need our respect and and those are things that you have to have as a human  and being i'll go home and get your fucking shine box  these stupid celebrities you can't have it both ways yep you're right you can't have it both ways 
[04:02:00]  i think once you make a reality show of your life it's like at that all bets are off yeah it's over  they try to say no man it's okay you can't have it both ways there's so many famous people like  take a guy like christopher walken you never see him at a starbucks right the guy's been famous since like  the 70s i think right yeah and like you you cast that net out trying to get that kind of attention  and then it turns on you and then also it's like they're too much but yeah the paparazzi to you know  get themselves bigger yep in hollywood and in our eyes as we read the dumb magazines they sell the 
[04:02:30]  pictures of themselves and the baby to publications but then when someone gets a freebie with the  telephoto lens there's a problem with that then it has nothing to do with your privacy it has to do  with the fact that you're not making a dime off of it that too it's not privacy that's obviously  you didn't have a problem with that it's all about the almighty dollar that's what i say big uh big  oil that's right big tobacco hey guys uh spears is miserable but she's here for a reason why oh well  it's fine why is she here and yet as upset as it makes you you you wouldn't trade your life now 
[04:03:00]  it seems that seems strange for some people to understand if they're making you this miserable  how can you still say but i'm lucky because i have to believe that i'm here for a reason  oh god what's the reason i don't know i keep searching every day just like you do  but i'm so blessed with my baby that's the happiest thing that's ever like a miracle you know um 
[04:03:30]  um but i just want the most normal life possible for him that's all is that possible i will manage  i will create that god damn rich as much as that makes me laugh i'm also laughing with when is jeff  goldblum going to jump in when is he going to say of course you know why she's crying she knows 
[04:04:00]  they're going to have to live off of cave feds cd sale money they're in deep trouble she is in  trouble what was the name of that that song pop is now bill pop is out come on it was good man  she's very underrated she's heading toward a nervous breakdown it's very obvious is she pregnant now  yeah second child i look i know this is going to be harsh and it's very rare that you actually want  someone's baby to be retarded oh jesus oh jimmy oh jimmy you know matt matt didn't even matt didn't 
[04:04:30]  even recognize her when uh she walked in and he said this this was edited out of the all right  what's your name fat body because you are a disgusting fat body  uh let's go to david in seattle david what's up hey good morning guys jimmy i loved you last night  thanks um matt lower sitting there what five feet away from her and she's got her big milk swollen  breast she's leaning over provocatively she's got that crotch short skirt on i couldn't watch that 
[04:05:00]  thing and not picture loads all over her face yeah she's she's probably sexy even knocked up i'd still  like to uh hey here's the clip from yesterday uh jimmy didn't hear this yet this is where matt  lower was trying to get her crying oh yeah failed miserably they managed to snap a picture  that didn't cast you in the best light oh of course that is their job and they do a very good job  at it and they've crossed the line so many times you know and i think because i'm a sweet young girl 
[04:05:30]  no nothing ever gets really done about it you know when you were driving with sean on your lap did it  i clearly and it seems like that that driving instance i did it with my dad i sit in his lap and  i drive we're country that's what you know what i mean but what happened though it crossed from a  paparazzi incident to next day it's in the newspapers and you've got all these legitimate people  weighing in saying you know what that's dangerous right too and she put her child at risk you saw the 
[04:06:00]  questions that were being asked three is britney a bad mom it's not like did britney record a bad song  he fell on the ground after that wearing a bad outfit is britney in a bad marriage  is britney a bad mom is pretty ugly that's america for you and he did it again is britney  a bad mom a bad mother yeah it's not like they're saying everything that i'm going to say that they are  saying yeah god damn rich cunt a bad mom that's america for you yeah but as a mother that has to
