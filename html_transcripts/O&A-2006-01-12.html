<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opened with a discussion about the homoerotic nature of men's underwear packaging, sparked by Anthony's shopping experience.  He and Opie compared various brands (Fruit of the Loom, Calvin Klein, The Gap, Abercrombie & Fitch), criticizing the use of near-nude, muscular men in advertising.  Caller Craig, a personal trainer, shared his agreement, and the hosts speculated that the suggestive packaging was aimed at women buying for their partners.  Several callers contributed their opinions and experiences, including Scott, a former underwear model, who offered insider details of photoshoots.  This segment transitioned into a personal anecdote from Anthony about a frightening late-night encounter with a man who claimed Anthony had ordered a pizza. Opie followed with a similar story of a near-assault in his Buffalo apartment. The segment concluded with a performance by "retarded Laverne and Shirley," (later identified as Marion and Lady Di in another segment) in their recurring "movie game" bit, where they acted out scenes for callers to guess.

The "movie game" continued, with callers attempting to identify films like *American Psycho*, *Animal House*, and *Full Metal Jacket*, often met with crude insults and homophobic slurs from Opie and Anthony.  This segment was interspersed with side conversations and jokes, including a caller misunderstanding a *Jaws* scene.  A significant portion of this section focused on a "pickled punk" (a preserved fetus) Opie had received as a gift, which was causing him anxiety and was even prompting calls to the FBI.  The staff, including Mars and Danny, were involved in the discussion, and Stephen Lynch was mentioned as being present. The segment ended with a plan to return the pickled punk to its owner, Andy Gore, using a sage-burning ritual.

The next segment centered on the "pickled punk" and its purported bad luck. Opie and Anthony brainstormed methods for removing this "evilness,"  discussing occult bookstores and Opie's personal items, including a childhood scar and a bone necklace.  Andy Gore then appeared as a guest, resulting in the return of the pickled punk. The conversation shifted to Gore's sideshow, his travels with Katie Ketchup (who has a ketchup fetish) and Jungle Jim Kim, and his collection of pickled specimens, described in explicit detail.  They briefly touched upon Gore's encounter with Lou Ferrigno, a controversial Hitler T-shirt, and the negative reaction to Kirstie Alley's "Fat Actress" from the National Eating Disorders Association.

The show then addressed a scene from Kirstie Alley's show depicting bulimia.  Opie, Anthony, and Jim Norton discussed the portrayal of eating disorders, comparing them to alcoholism and drug addiction, and debated whether obesity is a disease.  They shared personal anecdotes and listener calls offered varied perspectives.  The segment included discussion of two 911 calls; one about fighting daughters and the other about an incorrect Burger King order. The 911 operator's inappropriate joke in the first call was highlighted, along with his subsequent reprimand.  The discussion was replete with vulgar language.

A call from a woman enraged about her Burger King order launched the next segment.  Opie and Anthony, along with Jimmy, ridiculed the caller's entitlement, fantasizing about increasingly extreme and violent responses, including suggestions of arrest, child removal, and sexual assault.  They speculated about her unhappy marriage before pivoting to Billy Joel's rehab stint and his marriage. A nonsensical bit about a trip to Mars followed.  The main portion of this segment featured "What's Happening in Your Town,"  where callers recounted bizarre and often horrific local news stories including shootings, animal attacks (potentially fabricated), sexual assaults, a pastor kissing a goat, a child shooting their father, and a judge's handling of a minorâ€™s abortion request.  A caller shared multiple tragic incidents from Nebraska. The show concluded with promotional information.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  Thank you for listening. 
[00:00:30]  Thank you. 
[00:01:00]  Thank you. 
[00:01:30]  Thank you. 
[00:02:00]  Thank you. 
[00:02:30]  Thank you. 
[00:03:00]  Thank you. 
[00:03:30]  Thank you.  Thank you. 
[00:04:00]  You're listening to the worst.  You're listening to the worst.  That's the best.  All of it is so bad, it's hard to tell which is the worst.  The absolute worst.  And you're listening to the worst.  And you're listening to the worst of Opie and Anthony's.  The worst of Opie and Anthony's.  It's absolutely awful.  Anthony went and bought underwear.  Who cares?  It was hot.  It's not just about me buying underwear.  It's the problems I encounter buying new fashionable underwear in homoerotic packaging.  Oh, is this what you're talking about? 
[00:04:30]  I don't want to give the thing away, but is this what you're talking about holding all the guys  that are naked on the boxes and you don't want to hold it?  Right.  That thing.  I remember.  Now I know what I'm going to do with every one of these.  You're going to rean it.  You're reaning it for everybody.  You're such a dick and I love it.  All right.  Yeah.  Anthony buys underwear and he sees he had a nice observation about what's going on with  the packaging.  A little problem.  A little problem.  Sure.  The worst.  The worst.  Opie and Anthony. 
[00:05:00]  I know.  Have we discussed, of course, clothing and whatnot.  Another great segue.  Have we discussed buying underwear that is not just Fruit of the Loom underwear?  No.  No?  Because I don't know what is in the underwear maker's minds, but it's embarrassing.  It's like they don't want guys to buy their product.  I've kind of gotten past the point that I want to buy Fruit of the Loom underwear. 
[00:05:30]  I don't know.  So, I kind of want to step up a little notch and maybe buy some of the Calvin Klein underwear.  What?  It's better made.  I'll tell you where I'm going.  It's made better.  It's not just like the stupid rubber bands around your legs and waistband that Fruit of  the Loom has.  Wait, boxer briefs you want to start buying?  Well, yeah, boxer briefs, things like that, but just like name brand kind of underwear that's 
[00:06:00]  made of thicker material.  It's nicer.  And I got to step in.  I mean, honestly, logically, that makes sense.  And to the people out there that are new to the show and they don't really know you,  they're like, yeah, this sounds very normal.  Sure.  I've known you for a long time and you're just not the same person.  What is going on in your head?  I'm just treating myself to a few of the nicer things in life.  Do you realize this is the 38th day in a row that you haven't worn the same shirt? 
[00:06:30]  I wasn't counting.  We're keeping track now.  I wasn't counting, but thank you.  So you're shopping for some silk Versace boxers and...  Well, no, not silk.  It's cotton.  It's cotton, but if you notice, the material's thicker.  It's more comfortable and they don't stretch out around the legs and stuff.  It's not the underwear you wore when you were six years old. 
[00:07:00]  You know what I mean?  You kind of move up a little bit.  But these things are almost impossible to shop for.  You go to the store.  They don't come in little, like, plastic bags.  They come in boxes.  And there's a couple or three in the box.  But have you looked at the pictures on the boxes?  Yes.  No.  You walk into the underwear section and now I want to buy the underwear,  but I don't want to peruse through gay pornography.  It is like you are looking at the covers of gay porn DVDs. 
[00:07:30]  And you're looking at them.  You're a man standing there with your arms crossed looking at these guys in their underwear  with armadillos shoved down the front of them.  With huge hogs.  Giant hogs poking through his underwear.  And that's all they're wearing.  Poking and wanting.  Tanned washboard abs.  Straining is a word I would choose.  Biceps, smile.  They're smiling at you and kind of winking. 
[00:08:00]  All they want to do is just breathe.  It is.  You don't want to look.  You don't want to shop.  So you're looking at them.  And now you've got to go, maybe these.  And you're thinking, why am I going from this to this?  What makes this box better?  Is the guy cuter on the box?  Because he has that look of just wanting on his face.  It is.  It's pornography.  It's homosexual porn. 
[00:08:30]  That's really funny.  On the boxes.  And I just want to buy the goddamn underwear.  But it makes it impossible.  So now you're walking to the register, holding five boxes of nude men.  And you put it on the counter.  And there they are, staring back at you.  Thanks for the purchase.  I bought underpants from The Gap recently.  Yeah.  And I took them home.  And it looked okay on the thing, like you're talking.  Then I put them on.  And then proceeded to throw them away.  Really?  Yeah, because they, the ones I got from The Gap make me look like I have one of those 
[00:09:00]  European bathing suits on.  I don't know what that happened.  Like a Speedo?  Not a Speedo.  It's like, it kind of like, it's almost like hot pants for guys.  Yeah.  The only way I can explain it, it's like, it's like to here.  And it didn't look like that on the packaging.  Did it look like a bikini?  Not a bottom.  Bikini.  Was it cut like that?  It's like the hot pants the girls wear.  But just picture it a little looser so it would look, I guess, okay on the guy.  I don't know.  There's real hot underwear that chicks wear. 
[00:09:30]  Boy shorts?  Yeah, those short things with the frills on the bottom and around the top.  That is like the hottest fucking underwear that girls can wear.  The little short things.  I love those boy shorts.  Isn't that great?  Oh, fantastic.  Yeah.  So when your chick is buying your underwear, that's fine.  She could go up.  There's the guy with the pecs and the abs and the muscles and the wanting look and the  perfect hair and the huge goddamn python shoved down the front of his Calvin Kleins. 
[00:10:00]  But to have to look at this, because you can't just walk up, grab it, and walk up to the  register.  You have to stand in front of this huge display of nude men and look at them.  What's the size on this one?  Hmm.  Maybe this style.  You go, uh, have you gone into Abercrombie and Fitch lately?  No.  With the big blown up posters of, of, uh, boys topless?  God!  Why are we exposed to this?  What is going on?  I just want a pair of jeans. 
[00:10:30]  You just want some clothes.  And you gotta look at, at gay pornography.  You're right.  There's something going on with Abercrombie and Fitch.  Because it's mostly topless boys and, and, uh, the big posters on the walls.  Every once in a while.  What a hair to be found.  Every once in a while they throw a girl at you.  But in general, it's, it's these, like, I don't know.  I guess they're supposed to be 16, 17-year-old boys.  Topless.  Mm-hmm.  What the fuck?  Oh, dear.  Oh, dear.  What the?  Who the?  What the?  What the? 
[00:11:00]  Ah.  Ah.  Ah.  Ah.  Ah.  You will be molested.  Hey, Craig, what's up?  Hey, what's going on, fellas?  Hey.  Hey, um, no, I agree with Anthony, man.  I'm a personal trainer.  I'm a big boy.  I'm, like, 6'1", 220, very athletic.  And I got to buy those, uh, Calvin Klein ones, and it's terribly uncomfortable just going in  there, staring at nude men, trying to pick up some drawers.  Just.  Yeah.  It makes you yearn for the day of just grabbing that Fruit of the Loom and that plastic bag at 
[00:11:30]  a Dwayne Reed or something.  And just, you know, wear that.  And get out of there.  You don't want to stand in front of a hundred boxes with nude men on them.  It's men in their underwear with huge hogs.  And you got to stand there and pick and choose.  Yeah.  And you feel like, you know, all right, what style should I get?  Should I get the one that's cut this way or that way?  And the only way you have to make that decision is to look at the guy.  Well, it looks hot on him. 
[00:12:00]  You know what?  You don't want to have to be put in the position where you're looking and deciding what underwear  you want because it looks hot on that man.  No.  Just put a picture of the underwear on there.  You ever seen The Invisible Man?  You ever seen an Invisible Man movie?  Yes.  A movie.  I'm like, how can you see The Invisible Man?  Of course not.  I saw Hatbox.  I saw Hatbox floating by.  Glasses and gauze.  But, you know, he can walk around in his underwear, but all you see is the underwear. 
[00:12:30]  Saw quick steps in the snow once.  Jesus.  That's it?  I've seen him.  He produces this radio show.  Hey, yo, quick question.  That's what I want to see on the box.  Just the underwear.  Hold on, bro.  Just the underwear as if The Invisible Man was wearing it.  All right.  Put it on there and just have it take out the person.  So now you're looking at the underwear itself.  Not on a guy.  No guy is going in and buying it because the guy looked good on the package. 
[00:13:00]  Have women wearing the goddamn men's underwear.  How about that?  Then I'd look and go, ooh.  You'd feel gay then.  Then you'd feel like a fag buying these because they're on chicks.  No, but it's the chick wearing men's underwear, you know?  So it's like, all right, I see what style it is, how it's cut, how far down the leg it comes, things like that.  But it also is a pleasure to look at.  Sure is.  And you can take it home and save the box to Jack, too.  There you go.  Craig, what's up again?  Hey, one last thing.  You guys mentioned Abercrombie & Fitch. 
[00:13:30]  I've never been in that store because, one, the pictures are appalling.  But, two, that just seems like the whitest white guy store.  Well, are you a white guy?  By no means.  Were you going to go out and buy some fubu?  Oh, of course not.  But, I mean, like, that store, I mean, I don't know.  Everybody looks the same in that store, like you guys were hinting yesterday.  You shop at Banana Republic, don't you?  Actually, kind of all over the place.  Like I said, I'm a big guy, so it's hard to find clothes that fit. 
[00:14:00]  You're right about Abercrombie & Fitch.  I'll take a peek.  They've got some stuff that other people aren't really wearing.  That's what I go for, I guess.  All right, folks, punch them out.  All right, Craig.  Buddy Rock.  We've got to go back to, all right, yeah, we'll do this.  Mark from Queens, what's up?  Are you guys insane?  I think you guys are absolutely nuts, and this whole Howard Hughes lifestyle has gone to your head.  What happened to just going into Target, ripping off a three-pack of fucking Fruit of the Loom,  and just walking out the door? 
[00:14:30]  I've got to disagree with you, dude.  Abercrombie & Fitch, and the Gap to buy underwear, you go into Target, one, two, three, you're done.  Oh, my God, let me tell you something.  I mean, going to the Gap for underwear, it gets a lot worse than that.  I mean, you do like the Ralph Lauren or the Perry Ellis, and that underwear is way, way up there.  Four words, gentlemen, Haines and Fruit of the Looms.  No, I know.  See, what I'm saying was I just wanted to step up a notch as far as my underwear went. 
[00:15:00]  I didn't like Fruit of the Looms.  The material's very thin.  The elastic isn't very good.  I just wanted a few pairs of comfy, thick, cottony underwear.  Why not?  Why not put some of your most valuable items that you own, your cock and balls, into something a little nicer?  Why are you spending so much time on underwear shopping?  You know you're only going to wear it once.  I didn't throw them away.  Then I incinerate them. 
[00:15:30]  Look, Jimmy's nodding.  Dirty, dirty underwear.  No.  I wear them.  I go, you know, they get washed, and I wear them again.  Yeah, sure you do.  But, and it's not like I'm...  Dude, you threw away a couch because it had a booger on it.  Yes, it did.  You know what's going on in your underwear?  Not people wiping their boogers in there.  It's my own stuff going on in there.  And they get washed.  That's all I'm saying.  But do they really get washed?  Of course they do.  They get bleached.  The bleach gets in there and washes all the dirt away. 
[00:16:00]  Washes all the dirty memories.  All the dirty things.  Anthony needs everything bleached now.  It's got to be bleached.  He's bleaching his hands.  No.  Look, I'm not saying all I wear.  I'm wearing Fruit of the Looms right now.  I'm not saying all I wear are these underwear.  But occasionally, especially if you're maybe going out and dressed nicely, you want to  complete the whole thing with some very nice underwear.  I got to...  Go ahead, Jimmy.  My Fruit of the Looms are awful, and people have to start realizing...  Thank you, Jimmy.  They look like diapers.  And I'm sorry, but you have to understand, folks, we're fancy people. 
[00:16:30]  Get you to it.  We're fancy people.  Fancy.  Fancy people.  What a lame word.  I got to tell you something.  I am fancy.  I thought this was like just a throwaway subject.  The phones have exploded.  Because I've hit a nerve.  They've absolutely exploded.  Let's go to Christine on Long Island.  Christine.  Hi, guys.  I want to see you guys are complaining because for, what, maybe two years you have to look  at half-naked men in advertising when women have been doing it for like 30, oh, you think 
[00:17:00]  I want to look at a woman bouncing around in a bikini to swallow soda?  Yeah, but that's hot.  And all girls have that lesbian thing in them.  Girls don't mind as much looking at nude or semi-nude girls.  That's for sure.  I totally agree with Anthony.  There's something going on with you girls.  You guys could get naked together.  You could kiss your girlfriends when you're out there drinking and stuff.  And you'd be barely ever kissed.  I guess this is the new trend, though, in advertising is to get the guys with less clothes on. 
[00:17:30]  And that's supposed to sell to guys?  Well, it's trying to show guys, like, you'll look like this in this, which is unrealistic.  It is.  No.  First of all, you've got to be delusional to think you can ever attain that look.  They're models.  They're paid huge amounts of money to look like that.  And it's genetics and the gay lifestyle and the gym. 
[00:18:00]  You want to see someone that looks hot in underpants?  Get a copy of Yellow Discipline.  That's right.  There you go.  Now you're talking.  The average Joe.  I was at that photo shoot.  I've never laughed harder.  There was this really, really hot photographer.  Put that on the Calvin Klein box.  Oh, my God.  This really hot photographer that had all these great ideas for Jim Norton's Yellow Discipline CD, Yellow Roses.  And got him, like, kind of like a James Bond type, like, suit to wear. 
[00:18:30]  Yeah.  And so Jimmy goes back behind the curtain to change.  And he comes walking out with just his underpants on, pulled as high as he possibly can.  His gut at the time just...  Awful.  Just overtaking all the underwear.  So all that's just sticking out.  Of course.  And he's basically going, I'm ready.  Here's what I want to do.  And the picture's up on...  I guess it's up on your websites, right?  Somewhere, yeah.  Go to eatabullet.com. 
[00:19:00]  It's really fun.  I don't know how young, almost completely nude men are selling to other men.  How the average guy that wants to walk in and get dressed, buy some clothes, is making a decision based on these nude men.  I don't get it.  You nailed it.  It's funny.  And you have to deal with it now.  Matt from Jersey, what's up?  How's it going, guys?  Hey.  I just wanted to say, you know, you're right about Abercrombie.  Not only is it the guys on the wall that are shirtless, but then you get the stuff from the store. 
[00:19:30]  And the bag they give you usually has two shirtless guys playing volleyball with each other.  And then you've got to walk through the mall.  But you see naked guys on the back.  It's awful.  And you catch, like, a glimpse of yourself in the mirror.  Oh, my God.  I forgot about the bag.  Now you have to walk through the mall with the bag with gay porn on it.  That's hilarious.  You can't even put it in the bag and get away.  Yeah, because do those two guys really want to be playing volleyball?  Yeah. 
[00:20:00]  Running into the ocean with a surfboard.  And then you've got to look like that as you walk through the mall.  You should just be walking around with a bag with a picture of a guy sucking another man's cock on it.  Yeah, just did some shopping.  But did you see the new bag they have now where there's not two guys anymore.  There's only one.  And he's walking out of St. Vincent's with a tear on his face.  Jesus.  You're just an awful human being.  You really are.  Oh, Christ. 
[00:20:30]  Let's go to Rooster, the trucker.  Rooster.  Hey, guys.  How you doing?  Hey, good.  Hey, first of all, I'd like to say it's so refreshing having you guys on the air.  Howard, man, Kyle, they suck.  Anyway, it's bad enough going into a mall and seeing pictures of guys.  But I was in a mall in Chicago, and they have half-nude live models on the floor, men and women.  Yeah.  That's what you need.  That's going to sell. 
[00:21:00]  That really sucks when you walk with your lady to have some guy standing right there with his underwear hanging out.  You know, I know nothing about marketing or anything like this, but as far as men's underwear goes,  I bet you they would sell a lot more if they made these boxes less provocative with the men on them.  Because there are guys, believe me, there are guys that will not buy them because they will not walk up to that display  and pick up a box with this naked guy on it with his huge hog in his underwear. 
[00:21:30]  There are guys that will not do it just for that reason.  Well, someone is, that was a good point.  Someone was saying that they hung up, that they're actually marketing this stuff for the girlfriends and the wives.  Is that what it is?  Because maybe they're the ones doing a lot of the shopping.  Doing the shopping.  Yeah.  Well, I must say that I have a girlfriend with me, and she's the one.  I made her take the boxes of underwear off the shelf and bring them up to the register.  I did not want to hold these and carry them around the store. 
[00:22:00]  That's a good point.  I bet you that's what they're going for.  The girls are out there doing all the shopping and taking care of their men.  How much underwear do the girls buy for men?  Like, are more girls buying their underwear for men, or do more men buy their own underwear?  Dude.  Because then that would make sense.  I only started buying clothes for myself two years ago.  You still feel free?  I know.  Me too.  So, you know, that person might be on to something there.  Scott from Jersey, what's up?  My mother would buy me the underwear.  Two seconds, Scott.  My mother would buy me the designer underwear for Christmas. 
[00:22:30]  Right.  So, I would open up the present at Grandma's house when we all get together on Christmas  Eve, and it was embarrassing there, too, because I opened it up, and I'm like, oh,  and I've got to pick up this box.  There's a guy with a huge hog on it.  And I'm like, thanks, Mom.  Yeah, Christmas.  Thanks for the man with the huge hog picture.  Anthony, show everyone what you got.  I got this picture.  Ka-ching, ka-ching, ka-ching.  Yeah.  Gay pornography.  Mommy got me gay pornography.  Scott from Jersey, what's up?  Hey, guys.  For about six months between high school and college, I actually was an underwear model 
[00:23:00]  for J.Crew.  Ooh.  Yeah, great.  Thanks.  Now, you guys got to be thinking about one of these photo shoots.  Now, when you're talking about the armadillo in the front of the guy's pants, first of all,  if you think about what you look like when you're just wearing underwear, it doesn't look  quite as round.  I mean, there's some hills and valleys in there.  So they actually place little pieces in there to make it perfectly round.  Not a full piece, but... 
[00:23:30]  So you got the G.I.  Joe or the Ken doll kind of bulge going, but no real distinction of balls or anything like that.  What is it, some kind of like a cup almost?  No, it's like an epoxy.  Like, it's like a...  So it's perfectly rounded, but it's not, like, hard.  It's almost like a Gibbs because it's got to look a little like skin.  And then think about me.  I'm standing there, and you got this guy who's undoubtedly gay, who's shoving this stuff around  my junk, molding, tickle around.  I mean, because I don't do it myself.  They have to mold it perfectly, like they were doing a sculpture. 
[00:24:00]  It's obscene.  Yeah, so you guys buy it, but it is marketed towards girls.  It's not marketed towards guys.  I'm a heterosexual male.  I like to say that on the air.  You better say that if you're disgusting.  Yeah, whatever.  All right, Scott, thank you.  Punch it out.  Bye.  A lot of times, I'll go to the store, like Abercrombie or something like that, and I'll  see the clothes, the guys with those shirts, and I think, like, I want to look like that  because the girls will like me better.  Sure.  Because I kind of, I want to look like Ashton. 
[00:24:30]  Let's say hi to Derek.  You want that body without the shirt?  You want to play volleyball?  I want the hair like that and stuff.  It's cool.  Derek from Kentucky, what's up?  What's up, man?  Hey.  Hey, Ope, I got to call you out on something.  Yeah, go ahead.  Let's see.  You've been getting on Ant about shopping, buying all these nice clothes because he's  changing.  What's up with you shopping at the Gap for underwear all of a sudden?  Are you going here to look at the gay guys or what the hell is going on?  No, I take a peek at the Gap every once in a while.  I needed some underwear.  I went over there.  Honestly, I don't remember seeing any of these pictures that Anthony is discussing at the 
[00:25:00]  Gap.  It might be there.  I'm not sure.  I'd deny it, too.  No, you can see them anywhere, dude.  You can see it in Macy's.  It's a friggin' Macy's.  You go in there and they have the underwear section and they're just loaded with these  boxes and every designer box has the gay guy with the huge hog on it.  Every single one.  I find this amazing that Ant seems to know where all these gay guys hang out at.  Say that again? 
[00:25:30]  I find it kind of amazing that Ant seems to know where all these gay guys hang out at.  I wasn't saying gay guys hang out.  I was saying the gay guys on the boxes.  All right, it's Eric's.  Exactly.  Shut up.  Shut up.  Shut up.  Okay.  People out there are going to have to start getting used to it.  This is a ritzy operation.  Ritzy.  We're ritzy?  And we like to be fancy.  That's right.  You're dealing with fancy people here.  Ugh.  Why'd you change the picture?  I just went, ooh. 
[00:26:00]  Go back.  Nice.  There you go.  Nice.  That's underwear.  Very nice.  Look at that.  Nice.  The lady.  Matching bra and panties.  Yeah.  Nice little blue.  Yeah, click the next one.  Very frilly.  Nice.  Now go forward.  Jesus, Eric, you have no idea how to do a radio bit, do you?  And then we were going to scream.  Ooh, that guy's got a leopard tattoo coming out of his underwear.  Travis from Oklahoma City.  Ugh.  Hey, man, I just want to know why the first caller on this subject was calling in to talk about  all this homoerotic stuff being offensive, but he described his body type. 
[00:26:30]  He might as well have just put male for male before that.  Punching out.  All right.  Wait, wait, wait.  I think we have exhausted this subject all of a sudden.  That was a good call.  Ian Anthony, XM202.  This was the time that someone was ringing my buzzer at 1130 at night, which to me is  the middle of the night when you're getting up to do a morning radio show.  And it was quite scary.  But he had ulterior motives.  Yeah, there was an intimidating black fellow with a pizza box. 
[00:27:00]  A delivery man?  Well, I don't know if he was a delivery man.  Did he cook the pizza?  It was a little scary, though.  Take a listen.  The worst of Opie and Anthony.  Lo mas mal de Opie and Anthony en XM202.  Anyway, last night I go to bed real early because, you know, we had the Atlantic City weekend  and stuff, and I'm in bed around nine.  I mean, I've been staying up a lot later with these new hours. 
[00:27:30]  Have you?  Yeah, it's been nice.  It's been working out well.  I don't stutter and fumble around with my words as much.  I'm getting a good night's sleep.  But, so, I'm sleeping for a good two to three hours, all right?  And all of a sudden my buzzer, over and over again.  And I'm in such a deep sleep, I'm thinking my alarm clocks go off.  I can't figure out what the noise is.  And I finally wake up.  Sounds fine on the air to me.  Thanks, man.  Sounds fine.  Okay.  You could just grab a mic and say that. 
[00:28:00]  I don't miss that apartment living.  Huh?  I don't miss that apartment living.  I remember that.  Meh.  Meh.  Oh.  So, maybe, I might have to talk to the NYPD after the show today is all I'm thinking.  Really?  Yeah, the more I think about it.  Scam.  So, yeah, Ben is with me.  He thinks scam.  So, the buzzer's going off like crazy, and I finally realize it's my buzzer, and I stagger  upstairs, my two-level abode. 
[00:28:30]  Thank you.  Oh, oh, oh.  It's just a basement.  Relax.  So, then I hit the, you know, the talk thing.  I'm like, yeah, what do you want?  Those things work so well.  Yeah, what do you want?  I'm the doggy boss, Dr. King.  What?  He either said FedEx, or I'm going to murder you.  What?  I'm getting a package, and I'm going to kill you.  Wait.  You have a package for me, or you're going to kill me?  I'm going to kill my, I'm going to kill my, I'm going to kill my, I'm going to murder a 
[00:29:00]  fucking knife.  What?  So.  I don't understand a word they say through those.  Well, here's the problem.  I'm hitting talk like, yeah, what do you want?  Something like that.  And all I hear is, you're in the space of him.  He's not, he's not hitting the talk button back on the intercom.  Just yelling.  And, but I could hear him outside.  Okay?  And he's trying to tell me that there's some kind of delivery or whatever.  Delivery?  Like food delivery.  That's all I can understand.  Did you hear the voice?  Yeah. 
[00:29:30]  Very well.  Could you imitate maybe what he sounded like?  Did you order a motherfucking pizza?  Was it like that?  Well, I don't.  Maybe, could you put a little inflection on it to imitate maybe what the voice sounded  like?  Everyone knows I don't do a lot of voices on this program, so I will write, I will write  what kind of gentleman this was, and then maybe you can help me out.  Oh, Bob, just based on, on.  N?  Oh, okay. 
[00:30:00]  All right.  He's written something on the paper that now completely explains.  So he's.  Who is there?  But he's not pushing the talk button.  And now I'm thinking, now, now I'm thinking, now that I'm wide awake, that this is part of  the scam probably.  Uh-huh.  So, uh, so I, I keep pushing the button.  What do you want?  Because I, I was woken up from a, a deep, deep sleep.  Right.  Deep sleep, right?  And, and I could hear outside the window that he's telling me in this, in this voice that  there's voice.  There's some kind of delivery.  Right.  And some kind of, I think, pizza delivery. 
[00:30:30]  Okay?  Yeah, I got pizza pie, motherfucker.  Did it sound something like that?  Uh, yeah, similar, sure.  Yeah, I got some delivery.  Is it something, something to that effect?  Yeah.  Hmm.  Something similar.  All right.  So, so, again, hitting, trying to get this guy to talk to the intercom.  What?  What do you want?  I didn't order anything.  And he's, he's insisting that I order this, uh, the pizza.  Uh-oh.  So, so now I'm like, God, I can't hear the guy through the intercom. 
[00:31:00]  So now I leave my, of course you can.  Now I leave my apartment.  See, here's where you get really stupid.  Now I leave my apartment.  Here's where, no matter where you live now, it is completely understandable that you grew  up on Long Island.  Right.  So.  Because you shouldn't have gone out.  Now here's the confusion.  Um, it turned out it was only 1130 at night, but because I was in bed and out cold, I really  didn't know what time it was.  And in my stupid brain, I thought it was the middle of the night.  Do you think a cowboy at a fort years ago hearing, woo, woo, woo, woo, woo, woo, would 
[00:31:30]  open the main gate and go outside?  Do you really think so?  No.  You stay in, you send some, uh, guys up to the towers with guns, and you protect yourself  within your fortress.  So I leave my apartment and go to the front door, which is double doors, and it's, it's  relatively safe, you know, considering, okay?  Uh, and he's inside the first door.  Uh-oh.  And he's just looking at the second, through the second window. 
[00:32:00]  Yeah.  Right at me.  And this guy was one of the scariest mofos I've ever seen in my life.  But he had your pizza.  Carrying a Domino's Pizza box, uh, uh, the warm bags.  I don't know what the fuck was in that.  Oh, geez.  This guy had gold two-faces.  Yeah.  He had Domino's Pizza with Glock topping.  He had gold teeth.  He looked like he stepped right out of one of these rap videos, okay?  No, no, no, that's not even true, because now all the rap videos, they're all polished  and nice.  Yeah. 
[00:32:30]  And this guy was...  Old school.  This was old school, scary looking dude with a Domino's, you know, bag with pizza.  Trying to convince me that I ordered the pizza.  Well, maybe you did and you forgot.  And I'm like, look, and now we're yelling through the glass.  I'm like, I didn't order the, you know, the pizza.  He's like, no, you ordered the pizza.  And then he's giving my address.  He goes, yeah, see, you ordered the pizza.  It's right on the box.  Your address.  You ordered this, man.  Just open the door, man.  We'll talk about this.  We can talk about this if you open the door. 
[00:33:00]  I don't think so.  And then he's getting...  I'm scared of you, sir.  Yeah, exactly.  I'm scared.  I'm scared of you.  This is me talking through the glass.  I'm scared of you, sir, and I'm protecting myself.  I am protecting myself.  I am scared of you.  Please call the police.  So he's really trying to convince me to open up the final door, Anthony.  You don't want to hire niggas, that's all.  The final door.  Now, let me just explain.  To get to me, you have to go through four locked doors. 
[00:33:30]  Four locked doors.  It's down to three are all open and ready to go.  Oh, boy.  There's only one to go.  One safety door left.  Now it all makes sense to me, you know, this morning with a clear head.  So he's like, he's trying to get me to open that final door to try to figure out this pizza situation.  Showing me the address right on the box.  I have to order it.  There's my address.  What's in the box?  This is what I wanted to tell him.  You're a phony. 
[00:34:00]  Hey, this guy's a great big phony.  Hey, you're a great big phony, you know that?  That's right.  You're a big fat phony.  Taunt him through the glass.  Now, what if some resident of the building would have come up at that point and opened the door to get in?  That would have been a sticky situation.  Well, then there's, you know, two of us, so I don't know.  Remember when Noonan was in the cage and D'Annunzio walked up and he wouldn't give him the coke?  Then you get a no coke, huh?  And he's making fun of him, calls him a jerk. 
[00:34:30]  And the head of the caddy shack came in, opened it up, told him to get out.  And then there was that big fight.  Same thing would have happened to you.  Fight with the bloody nose.  No bare feet.  So this guy is just kind of throwing his arms up and down and he's getting really pissed off.  And I'm like, you know, just screaming through the glass.  I didn't order the fucking pizza, man, you know?  And then he finally, he gave it a really good try and then he finally left.  And then I went back to, you know, my apartment just kind of freaked out about the whole situation. 
[00:35:00]  And then all night long just kind of listening with half an ear, like wondering if he's coming back and all that.  And then when I left this morning, I was kind of scared to leave the place.  Yeah.  Why?  Because I didn't know what the hell that was all about.  Well, not in the morning?  Yeah.  Like he was hanging out there?  Dude, I don't leave.  That's one of those, he moved on to somebody else.  Let me explain something, Jimmy.  When I leave my apartment, it's still dark.  I know.  When you get here, the sun is shining nice and high.  There's a big difference when we leave our apartment. 
[00:35:30]  No, no, no, I know that, but do you think six hours later you're still there with pizza?  Who knows?  Dylan, do you understand things are scarier at night?  Yes.  You know?  You get here, it's bright sunshine, you have to put sunscreen on.  When Ant and I get to work and get...  Sunscreen.  When we get to work and start, you know, preparing for the show, it's still pitch dark.  You just start hearing the birds a little bit, just a little bit, because they're waking up with you.  So what do you think?  This could have been a home invasion.  Do you think it could have been a legitimate mistake or a setup? 
[00:36:00]  Well...  No joke, the guy was scary.  A lot of the delivery guys are scary.  Yeah, but it sounds like it could have been a mistake, but you don't know.  Better to err on the side of safety and not...  You didn't want a pizza, so you don't let him in anyway.  Right.  The fact that he's ringing your buzzer...  I used to love the guys that would come to deliver and just smash two hands over all the buzzers  just so they could get in the door.  And some idiot just buzzes him in. 
[00:36:30]  You know, the whole security system falls apart.  Because there's one idiot.  There's one idiot.  There's one idiot in your building.  Just, meh, I don't care.  Right.  I'll hit the rape, rob, kill button over here and let him in.  Right.  It's there for a reason, you jackass.  But if you let him in, then he comes to your door and knocks.  You open that door.  Woo.  Kick it in.  That's what I'm thinking.  Home invasion.  That's what I'm thinking.  And hopefully he's just there for your property.  That's what I'm thinking.  Oh.  Maybe he's a big guy.  Maybe he just intimidates you into paying him for the pizzas that you didn't order. 
[00:37:00]  If he's upper west side, you know, white people would be scared of him.  And he corrects me.  Oh, maybe.  Look, man.  I got this pizza.  You got it.  He walks around with, like, one pizza.  Well, you know, I've told the story a bunch of times on the radio, but I'm pretty, you  know, safe because of what happened in Buffalo.  What?  The famous story in Buffalo.  Well, which one was that?  You don't remember the famous story in Buffalo?  No.  And when I was working in...  Oh, I do now.  Oh, that's creepy.  Dudes, what I'm about...  I forgot you were a victim of this. 
[00:37:30]  For the new listeners, for...  What I'm about to tell you is no radio exaggeration.  This is exactly how it happened.  What you're about to hear is shocking.  This is exact.  Okay?  I was doing overnights in Buffalo.  And so I was sleeping a lot of days and stuff, blah, blah, blah.  I was in this brownstone that had, you know, in a crappy neighborhood, North Pearl Street,  which was like...  Crappy neighborhood, Buffalo.  Yeah.  Well, it was like a lot of heroin addicts, a lot of druggies. 
[00:38:00]  You know, I wasn't making much money in the...  Buffalo.  And my apartment was very close to the station, so it was convenient.  But it was a safe building.  You had to get through two doors and then your apartment door to get to, you know, to get  to the person, okay?  Right.  And Opie is a pussy, should have called Domino's.  Eric from Miami, I was too tired, went back to bed.  Yeah.  Keep the door locked, go to sleep.  And, you know, and then just wonder all night, that's all.  Yeah.  Anyway, so I'm in Buffalo, and it was a brownstone, and, yeah, the front two doors were always 
[00:38:30]  locked, but I didn't lock my door for some stupid reason.  I have no idea to this day.  Why?  I have no idea.  It was just dumb.  You know, I was like on the fourth floor in the back.  I figured, I don't know, I just did it.  It's insanity.  So, uh...  Asking for it.  Around this time in Buffalo, there was a rapist that they were very, very concerned  about.  A black rapist, swear to God.  Very, very concerned about it.  They did some stories on the news.  You know, he raped here, he raped there, he raped here, blah, blah. 
[00:39:00]  Yeah.  Right.  Oh, no.  So, uh, so I'm sleeping on a, I think it was a Saturday or Sunday, in the middle of the  day, right?  Mm-hmm.  And, uh, some idiots in the building, like Anthony was just talking about, they were  moving out.  So, they didn't want to be inconvenienced, so they propped open both the bottom doors.  Eh, why not?  So, they're getting a load from upstairs, and they have the bottom doors propped so they  could get it into their station wagons and stuff. 
[00:39:30]  It was one of those cheap moves where you get all your friends and you try to get it all  in a couple of cars, you know?  So, the only problem is we lived in a really bad neighborhood, so this was, uh, you know,  gave somebody the opportunity to sneak in while you're going back upstairs, uh, to get  more stuff.  Right.  So, this is all I remember.  I'm out cold, laying on my side, and I wake up because I guess I feel a presence in my room.  Oh, boy.  This is the God's honest truth, man. 
[00:40:00]  I open my eyes to see a black guy in a hooded sweatshirt with the hood, you know, pulled  down really tight around his head, staring at me two to three inches away from my face.  Did you go, oh, my heart was in my throat.  Of course.  And I open up my eyes.  Until his cock pushed it out. 
[00:40:30]  I open up my eyes, and, uh, and the only thing I can say is, uh, uh, what are you doing  here?  Oh, that's a good one.  Well, what else are you going to do?  How many times has he heard that before?  I was like, well, I'm like, what are you doing here?  And I had long hair back then, you know, I was doing the rock thing.  Were you, oh, my God.  What?  You were almost raped.  Yeah, that's what he's getting at, Jimmy.  Oh, my God.  Wow, way to wake up.  You all right?  Yeah, I just hit him. 
[00:41:00]  Oh, yeah.  He's with the long hair.  Guy's right there in the room.  Well, this is, this is what, yeah, I can figure out what happened here.  So he's, you know, very close to my face.  I open my eyes.  I go, what are you doing here?  I didn't know what to do.  You're not going to, I didn't, I wasn't going to make the first move.  I didn't know what.  You know, I was waiting to see what the hell this is all about.  And obviously, it couldn't be good.  Why else would he be in my?  No, it couldn't be good.  Why else would he be in my room, you know?  He didn't even have a pizza box.  So I open my eyes.  I go, what are you doing here?  He looks at me.  I look at him. 
[00:41:30]  And then he jumps up and bolts and runs out of my apartment.  I'm like, oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  I jump out of bed like, holy crap, what the F?  And I remember I had some kind of, like, metal, you know, shelves, whatever, right inside my apartment where I always just threw my keys in my wallet when I came in.  I'm just like, dump that, you know, whatever.  And I'm away from home and all that crap.  So I'm thinking right away.  Now I'm thinking, oh, my God, oh, my God, you know, nothing's going to happen to me, but what the fuck did he, you know, take from my apartment?  So I jump out of bed because I hear the front door kind of, you know, slam closed again or whatever. 
[00:42:00]  And I run, and my wallet and my keys are missing.  So, but, fast forward a little bit, turns out I found them.  It was in my jeans or something.  I just didn't put them, you know, there.  Okay.  He runs out.  He didn't take anything from my apartment is the key to the story.  So now, you know, thinking about everything that went on that day, I'm thinking he was looking to rape again.  Yes.  And he saw this opportunity, you know, this brownstone is wide open because these people are leaving. 
[00:42:30]  Blonde-haired girl laying in bed.  Exactly.  So he goes into this apartment, starts, you know, trying for doors that are unlocked.  Bingo.  Mine's unlocked.  He goes in, you know, carefully, you know, sneaks into the bedroom, sees me maybe with my long hair on the pillow.  I don't know.  It's flowing.  And now he's looking, you know, real close to see if I'm a chick or not.  That's the only thing I could think of.  Man, good thing you said something.  He might have plastered your face in the pillow and still not knowing you were a guy, just thrusted up your ass. 
[00:43:00]  Oh, can you imagine?  Do you know how close you came?  Yeah, that was.  What if the guy didn't care, guy or girl?  True.  Wow.  That was the scariest moment of my life right there.  The scariest moment of my life.  So, and then I was able to, like, run out of the building to see him sprinting down the road.  Yeah.  And that was the last I ever saw of the dude, obviously, so.  Oh.  The last you ever saw of him?  Do you miss him? 
[00:43:30]  He never even came back.  Thing hard to get.  That was going through my mind last night with this weird Domino's experience.  Man.  Yeah.  I wouldn't even, no, I wouldn't even have left the apartment.  I'm like, what?  Who?  No.  No pizza, go away.  Well, he kept ringing the buzzer over and over again.  It was getting, you know, obnoxious.  Stop ringing the buzzer.  Call the cops.  There's a man.  There's a negro at my door.  I don't know what to do when a negro comes to my door. 
[00:44:00]  Joe from Jersey, what's up?  Hey, good morning, guys.  Oh, come on, man.  Splurge the extra money and go for the high-class apartment with the concierge there to keep  those guys out.  Yeah, well, Norton's like it's time to get in a building with a doorman.  All right.  Take it easy.  Punch it out.  All right.  Thank you.  And let's go to Angelo in Brooklyn.  Angelo.  Hey, listen.  I love the show, guys.  Got news for you.  It's got to be a scam.  Domino's takes your number when you place the order, and I've had it happen. 
[00:44:30]  And if they can't get you to the door, they'll call your phone.  No, really?  They'll call your phone.  Absolutely.  Had it happen repeatedly.  Huh.  Well, what was going to happen, you think?  The guy was just going to roll me for a few?  Home invasion.  Yeah, it was looking probably for a home invasion.  Or just maybe he just wanted $20.  All right, look.  Take this pizza.  Give me $20.  Yeah.  Right, right.  All right.  Thank you, buddy.  Yeah, man.  You go over a pizza guy, steal his pizza, and then you go and sell it.  We have audio of the black guy that walked into your apartment in Buffalo after Opie woke up. 
[00:45:00]  Hey, where are the white women at?  That is harsh, man.  All right.  Matt from Long Island.  Hey, Opie, did you run and hide in your panic room?  Yeah, you need a panic room.  All right, well.  Man, that is a frightening story, that Buffalo one.  Yeah, that one is the real deal, man.  That was just... 
[00:45:30]  Did you start keeping a weapon by the bed or something after that?  No.  You locked your door?  Oh, yeah.  Yeah?  Oh, yeah.  I've never kept my door unlocked since then.  I have weapons.  Anyone have weapons in their house?  No.  You got any weapons?  No, Jim?  No.  Well, you'd probably use them on yourself in some throes of depression.  Believe me, that's the only reason I don't own a pistol.  I don't own a pistol.  It's a lot easier than jumping out a window or something?  Yeah.  Just one second.  I don't think we want to admit to what weapons we have.  I know.  I understand that. 
[00:46:00]  I'm just saying if anybody needs, you know, a protection, it's, you know, somebody that's  opening up their doors for pizza delivery guys.  You know how much of a pain in the ass it is to get a gun the real way?  Ah, well, yeah.  I have a weapon, but it's a slow-acting weapon.  And it's in the bottom of my balls.  But this guy hangs around for six months to a year or two.  Freeze.  Anyway, why don't we take a break, Anthony?  All right.  We're just getting started.  I want to congratulate Jim Norton.  He had a great, great show at Atlantic City at the Bargata. 
[00:46:30]  Oh, thank you.  Had a lot of fun.  Remind me about the gambling experience with Joey.  Joey Paisano of Mulberry.  Went gambling with Joey, huh?  Yeah.  Nice.  After what I saw him do, I'm begging our faithful listeners to go down to Mulberry Street and  eat at Paisano's.  Oh, really?  Oh, my God.  Did he take a bit of a beating?  He's got, I think he's got a gambling problem.  Who doesn't?  I think he has a gambling problem.  Wow.  Unbelievable.  Absolutely unbelievable. 
[00:47:00]  High roller.  Yes.  Big time high roller.  As far as the people I hang out with.  Welcome to the OV and Andrew.  Oh, dinner.  Hey, man.  Here you go.  No, no, no.  That's cool.  Keep it.  Mmm.  Chicken.  Joey and Anthony show.  XM 202.  Do you have to do that?  No, I was just trying to get it out of my hand. 
[00:47:30]  It feels right.  It's really, really.  When I wrap the Starbucks thing on my hand, it just feels right.  Something feels right about it?  It just feels right.  It's tight.  Like, my hand is constricted.  I can't open my little hand.  That's good.  And it just feels right.  It's really annoying, though.  Not for you.  No, but it feels good.  It's really annoying this early in the morning.  Stop.  It's Friday.  We just want to get through another dumb show.  Friday.  Friday.  Friday.  Retarded movie game.  Oh, you know what?  This is one of my favorite bits.  I haven't heard this in a long time.  What are you doing?  Will you stop eating for one lousy minute? 
[00:48:00]  Bab, do the thing.  So, Lady Di and Marion, they are the retarded Laverne and Shirley.  And they came in one day.  That is so fucking annoying.  What an ass.  They came in one day.  This fucking idiot eats all morning long. 
[00:48:30]  Grazing in a field all day.  Grazing on just shit all morning.  Right?  We get it, you fucking asshole.  Are you going to drink that?  Yeah.  Can I finish?  The retarded Laverne and Shirley came in, Anthony.  Came in.  Yeah.  The retarded Laverne and Shirley came in. 
[00:49:00]  Oh, no.  And I read from some famous movie scripts, Anthony.  Yep.  And then the listeners had to guess what movie they were reading from.  It was like a little game.  Is this the Marcellus Wachelus Crip?  That is exactly what that is.  When she's reading a Pulp Fiction or something and she says Marcellus Wachelus instead of Marcellus Wallace.  That was hilarious. 
[00:49:30]  Oh, yeah.  That's it.  Very good.  Stay tuned.  It's the worst of Opie and Anthony.  You have to.  Hey, we're back with the Opie and Anthony show.  You have to, Ken.  Awful, Jim.  No one even knows what just happened.  Jim just got gotten by Opie so bad.  What was the line you used?  I didn't hear it.  During commercials, you know, we could see all the phone calls coming in. 
[00:50:00]  I go, oh, Jim, you want to take this one?  And then I just started looking at it.  And Jim came walking around the Opie side and goes, where?  What?  Where?  Which one?  Where?  Oh.  Then he made the face like Pesci when he walked into that house to become a made man and got shot in the head.  I just went on.  Oh, no.  Oh, no.  Pop, he got me.  Got.  You really got me good.  All right, we're running out of show fast, believe it or not.  Yeah.  It's been a very busy day.  We got the retarded of Ernest Shirley.  Speaking of freak shows there, Andrew. 
[00:50:30]  Yeah, how about these two?  You got to love these two, huh?  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Could you put them in formaldehyde?  You'd have pickled elephants.  You can make a little display with them, right?  Oh, yeah.  Easily.  Put them up.  The retarded of Ernest Shirley.  How are you?  Hi, people.  How are you?  Look, she's got her bling bling on.  Why are you dressed like Dan Tanna?  That is horrible.  Who is Dan Tanna?  Dan Tanna?  Who doesn't remember Dan Tanna? 
[00:51:00]  That's a detective show.  I got your t-shirt on.  Very good, Marion.  She's that awful flowered collar shirt.  I forgot the first name.  I forgot the name of the show, but he's a detective.  Oh, he's okay.  He's a detective.  He's from like the 80s, 70s, 80s.  Okay.  Yeah, whatever.  And it really bugs me that you and Stinky have the same hair.  That really annoys me, coming out of the back of the hat.  That really irritates me.  No, we don't have the same hair.  But you got your hair cut, Diane.  But you're still wearing hats.  I can't tell you got your hair cut.  You got your hair cut?  Yeah, I got my hair cut.  Let's see, Lady Di.  But how can I tell?  Your hat's covered on your head. 
[00:51:30]  Lady Di, you might be using too much soy sauce when you go to the Japanese restaurant there.  Your face is a little...  Soy sauce?  Yeah, it bloats the face.  You might want to cut back on that.  Oh, Jesus.  Okay, I will.  I'll cut back on that.  Apparently, you have soy sauce and an IV drip at your house.  I'd like to cut your hair with an axe that is...  You have a little...  What do they call that haircut?  Like a...  What happens?  Almost like a Dutch boy.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Beer.  Kind of.  Oh, the beer is making her bloated?  Is that what's doing her?  Oh, Mary is saying that the beer is bloating you up there, Lady Di. 
[00:52:00]  That is not true.  Too much yin-yang party?  No.  You try to tell her, right?  Now, Marion, I can see Marion is a very good friend to you, Lady Di.  You don't take her word.  She's the one that's responsible.  She knows what's best for you, and you don't listen to her.  Because, Di, I try to tell you, certain beers that you drink, it shows in your face.  I tell you, it's which...  Yeah.  That chocolate cake beer you've been shoving into your mouth.  All the old duals beer that I've been drinking.  It's really putting tons on you.  You gorilla.  Oh.  Oh, man. 
[00:52:30]  I look okay.  My haircut looks okay.  I look okay.  She has been working out, but I have, well, not as much.  Your haircut does look okay if you're a Mexican in 1930.  You should be working on a railroad with that haircut.  I've been laughing at your gym all week.  At least I have hair.  I know you do.  Oh, now Lady Di coming back.  No, that's not even a good one, because he chooses not to have hair.  We've both been lacking.  Like, if he was bald, then you might be onto something, but he just chooses to shave his  head like that.  I'll think of something to tell him.  Because all the other fellas shave their head like that, right, Jim?  We've both been lacking the gym all week.  I only went once this week. 
[00:53:00]  Really?  Well, I had a lot of appointments I had to keep this week, so.  On your planet, how long is a week in our time?  Yeah, exactly.  Now, I see you're wearing a Jim Norton t-shirt, though.  Yes, I am.  You can bitch and complain about him all you want, but you're wearing his shirt.  And she's so fat, it's actual size.  And you're always online with him, too, so.  You're online with him at least once every two weeks.  All right, listen.  I talk to him once in a while.  All right, can we play the movie?  Hi, how are you?  The movie game.  It was such a great success last time we did it opening. 
[00:53:30]  What are we doing here now?  Shut up, ladies.  As you recall.  We gave you your time.  Now you've got to listen a little bit.  Lady Di-Marion will be giving scripts to famous scenes from famous guy movies.  They will then go back and forth with the dialogue from the movie, and we will go to a lucky caller on our screen, and that caller must figure out what movie that scene is from, based solely on their, what is going to be an Academy Award winning performance of that scene. 
[00:54:00]  You know, guys, you're at the theater today.  Marlon Brando whistles clearer than you speak.  Hey, I don't know how to whistle that good, do you?  Okay, we're ready to play.  Nice comeback, Marion.  Well, all right, now, look, look, I already see a problem with this.  Is this the same one they have?  Now, why did you print this?  Because they're going to read this and ruin the whole game.  You did?  Do not read anything that has crossed.  Do not mean anything that may quamp down. 
[00:54:30]  We got you, Anthony.  We won't do that.  Now, when you look at the paper, don't mumble.  Don't read a thing aloud.  You guys are crazy.  You know they're going to mess it up anyway.  I know, I try.  Yeah, you know what, buddy.  Shut up.  We got Billy from Oceanside.  What's up, Billy?  What's up, guys?  You ready to play the movie game?  Yep.  All right, listen closely to this scene that will be enacted by these two, and try to figure  out what the movie is.  Now, Marion, you will be playing the part that starts first.  Don't say it. 
[00:55:00]  Don't mouth it.  Don't mouth it.  Don't say it.  And, Lady Di, you're playing the second one.  Okay.  You see that.  Don't say it.  Now, start your scene.  Um, when we say, action.  And, Billy, you know what you're doing, right?  Yeah, no problem.  Okay.  All right, let's go, ladies.  Go ahead.  All right, go.  You like Huey Lewis in the news.  They're okay.  Their early work was a little too new way for my face.  Cut, cut, cut.  Marion? 
[00:55:30]  Marion?  Hello?  If I could ask you, please play it up a little more.  You're just reading it very monotonic.  Yeah, you were acting last time.  You're acting.  Get your face out of the page, as they say.  You're acting.  You're acting.  Have a connection with the other actor.  All right?  Okay.  Okay.  This, let me just say, without giving anything away, your performance as you read these lines,  you should be very analytical.  Very into it.  Yeah.  Very into what you're saying.  Okay.  Be very into what you're saying.  Okay, buddy.  Passionate about what you're talking about.  Passionate for what you're talking about. 
[00:56:00]  Because you're built like Gamera.  You don't have to read like them.  You're pretty built like King Kong.  Oh!  She understood the movie monster, though.  She got it right.  You're such a Godzilla movie, too.  Very good, Marion.  Okay, take two.  Take two.  Quiet on the set.  And action.  You're like Huey Lewis and the News.  They're okay.  Their early work was two new ways for my taste, but when sports came out in 83, I think  they really came into their own.  Commercially and artistically.  The whole album has a clear, crisp sound and a new sheen of consummate professionalism that 
[00:56:30]  really gives songs a big boost.  He's been compared to Elvis Costello, but I think Huey has a far more bitter, cynical  sense of humor.  Hey.  Yes, Alan.  Why are there copies of the style section all over the place?  You have a dog?  A little chow or something?  No, Alan.  Is that a raincoat?  Yes, it is.  In 87, Huey Lewis released this. 
[00:57:00]  For their most accomplished album.  I think their undisputed masterpiece is hip to be square.  A song so catchy, most people probably don't listen to their lyrics, but they should because  it's not just about the pleasure to comfort me and the importance of friends.  It's also a personal statement about the band itself.  Hey, Paul.  Ah, they're getting your reservations at Dorcia.  Now you effing selfish bastard.  You effing selfish bastard.  You girls are passionate.  There it is. 
[00:57:30]  I'm glad she took my advice and read it with a little more passion.  You did nothing.  You did not emote anything.  The emotional range of an autistic.  That was horrible.  You should drive the car slow on Saturdays.  You didn't sound into what you were saying.  You were, again, just reading.  I disagree.  I was into it.  You disagree?  It was awful.  I thought she did pretty well with that one.  I'll switch places.  Well, no, because the whole thing is you doing.  All right, she showed me. 
[00:58:00]  And Billy from Oceanside, what movie were they acting out?  Don't You Stare at It, Eat It, American Psycho.  Oh, American Psycho, with Marion playing, of course, Bateman.  American Psycho.  They don't even know the movie.  Jesus.  All right, hold on the line.  They're going to get your info.  It's about a guy who found you attractive.  I like the way she did.  What about a woman that could find you attractive?  Hey, Paul, ah, what's a woman?  Stupid.  All right, hold on, hold on.  Go ahead, Ann.  Did you like the part where she went, hey, Paul, ah, you're getting your reservation?  It's like, no, it's like, hey, Paul. 
[00:58:30]  And then, ah, the guy, he's killing him at that point.  He's screaming as he's acting.  We have to get into the acting.  Listen, shut up.  So we have a reference point.  This is the scene.  You like Huey Lewis and the News?  They're okay.  Their early work was a little too new wave for my taste.  But when sports came out in 83, I think they really came into their own, commercially and artistically.  The whole album has a clear, crisp sound and a new sheen of consummate professionalism that really gives the songs a big boost. 
[00:59:00]  He's been compared to Elvis Costello, but I think Huey has a far more bitter, cynical sense of humor.  Hey, Albus, you're in it.  Yes, Alan?  Why are there copies of the style of sexual album played?  Do you have a dog, a little chow or something?  No, Alan.  Is that a raincoat?  Yes, it is.  In 87, Huey released this. 
[00:59:30]  Four, your most accomplished album.  I think their undisputed masterpiece is Hip To Be Square.  The songs don't catch you.  Most people probably don't listen to the lyrics.  But they should, because it's not just about the pleasures of conformity and the importance of friends.  It's also a personal statement about the band itself.  Hey, Paul!  Ah!  I couldn't take the punishment.  I had to settle down.  Take any of the reservations in Tork, get down, you fucking stupid bastard! 
[01:00:00]  I'm just lying.  Ah!  You!  Fuck me!  Fuck me!  I don't even care.  I thought you'd know what's going on.  You hit the B Square.  You hit the B Square.  God damn, what a movie.  I think the ladies nailed that.  I think you guys hit it on the head now that I listen back.  You nailed it.  You did very well, man.  You hit it on the head, that one.  I think it was being a little too harsh.  We didn't even listen to news.  I had forgotten what the actual scene sounded like, Obie, so now hearing it, you guys nailed it. 
[01:00:30]  You guys were right on.  Okay.  Bravo.  Thank you.  Is that not one of the best scenes in any movie ever?  I can't get enough of that movie.  You look.  All right, shut up.  I know why.  We've talked about...  Mr. Book.  We're running out of time now.  And this game is too priceless.  This game's too close to my heart.  I like this game.  All right.  Now, again...  I want to exploit it to its fullest potential.  Keep your mouth shut.  Don't read a thing until we tell you and just read what we told you.  Tom from Philly.  What up?  You want to play the movie game?  You know it. 
[01:01:00]  All right, cool.  All you have to do is listen to these two lovely ladies.  We're whales.  Thank you, Obie.  Act out a scene from a very popular movie, and if you guessed the movie, you got the tickets.  Okay?  No problem.  All right.  Are you ladies ready?  Yes, we are.  Okay.  You, let's see.  Lady Di will be starting.  Rick's got it figured out, I think.  I hope so.  Just let me know when.  No, we know.  All right.  Yeah, we know.  There's some emotion in this, too.  Okay.  In other words, just let me know when. 
[01:01:30]  Marion gets all the good lines.  Beautiful.com.  Marion's the real star.  She gets all the good lines.  Good website.  Lady Di is filler.  Go ahead.  Lady Di, start this off.  Action.  They kicked us out of school?  Ha.  That makes sense.  Hey, what's this laying around?  S.  Is he on the floor?  War's over, man.  Wormer dropped the big one.  What?  Over?  Did you say over?  Nothing's over until we decided it is.  What?  Was it over when the Germans bombed Pearl Harbor?  Hell no.  Germans forget it.  He's rolling. 
[01:02:00]  It ain't over now, because when the going gets tough, the tough get going.  Who's with me?  Let's go.  Oh, come on.  Ah!  Keep going.  That's all you.  What's the F happen to the Delta?  I used to know.  Where's the spirit?  Where's the guts?  Ha.  This could be the greatest night of our lives, but you're going to let it be the worst.  Oh, we're afraid to go with you, Bluto.  We might get in trouble.  Well, just kiss my A from now on.  Not me.  I'm not going to take this. 
[01:02:30]  Wormer, he's a dead man.  Marmalade.  Dead.  Niedermeyer.  Dead.  Bluto's right, psychotic.  But obviously right.  We've got to take these bastards.  We could fight them with conventional weapons, but that could take years and cost millions of lives.  No, in this case, we have to go all out.  I think the situation absolutely requires a real futile and stupid gesture to be done on somebody's part,  and we're just the guys to do it.  Let's do it.  Let's do it! 
[01:03:00]  Wow!  All right.  I felt like I was there watching the movie again.  Tom's going to get this.  There you go.  We're getting better.  Man, they acted that out perfect.  That's my favorite.  Tom, if you would please tell us what movie they were doing that famous scene from.  Well, Otter, I'm going to have to go with Animal House.  Yeah!  Animal House!  Wow!  Was that amazing?  Obviously.  Bluto's right, psychotic.  Niedermeyer.  Dead.  No!  Bluto's dead.  Dead.  Bluto's right, psychotic. 
[01:03:30]  All right, so we have a reference point.  Here it is.  It kicked us out of school?  Huh.  That makes sense.  Hey!  What's this lying around, s**t?  War's over, man.  Wormer dropped the big one.  What?  Over?  Did you say over?  Nothing is over until we decide it is.  Was it over when the Germans bombed Pearl Harbor?  Hell no!  Sherman?  Forget it.  He's rolling.  And it ain't over now. 
[01:04:00]  Because when the going gets tough...  A tough get going!  Who's with me?  Let's go!  Come on!  Come on!  Come on!  Come on!  What the f**k happened to the Delta I used to know?  Where's the spirit? 
[01:04:30]  Where's the guts?  Oh!  This could be the greatest night of our lives.  But you're gonna let it be the worst.  Oh!  We're afraid to go with you, Bluto.  You know, we might get in trouble.  Well, just kiss my ass from now on!  Not me!  I'm not gonna take this!  Warmer, he's a dead man!  I'm alive!  Dead!  Need a liar!  Dead! 
[01:05:00]  Bluto's right.  Psychotic.  But absolutely right.  We've gotta take these bastards.  Now,  We could fight him with conventional weapons.  That could take years.  It could cost millions of lives.  Well,  in this case,  I think we have to go all out.  I think this situation absolutely requires 
[01:05:30]  a really,  futile,  and stupid gesture  be done on somebody's part.  We're just the guys  to do it.  Let's do it.  Bravo!  Great, great scene that was.  How memorable.  Animal House.  That's like me  in my high school days. 
[01:06:00]  Oh, yeah?  Yeah.  That's when we saw,  that's when we saw the movie,  right?  In our high school days.  Oscar from the Bronx.  We never went to college,  so we don't know.  From the Bronx checking in,  saying at least she looks like Belushi.  I'm not heavy, so.  Well,  the guy was saying that.  You're not heavy compared to  a Jupiter moon, maybe.  I'm not heavy.  Yes, you are.  No, I'm not.  You are.  Yes, you are.  How much you weighed, Jim?  About 140.  All right, listen.  We're gonna play  one more before break here.  Look at you arguing with her.  Take it easy,  drier-lit hair.  Hey,  let me tell you, 
[01:06:30]  my hair doesn't look bad.  I like the way it looks.  All right,  one more now.  Marion,  Marion,  I like your hair.  I know he is.  I know cancer patients  that would rather have their hair  than cancer patients.  Do you have cancer patients?  Do you have cancer?  You almost said  do you have cancer patients.  No.  You really are.  I like what you're going on.  She doesn't have cancer patients.  She doesn't have cancer patients.  She does not.  Cancer patients are bald.  What's a cancer patient, Marion?  They're bald.  Cancer patients are bald.  I'm enjoying your new look.  Yeah.  I like it.  Yeah, I like it.  I don't press people.  I just press myself. 
[01:07:00]  No jokes.  There's nothing wrong  with a perm being  bobby pinned back  in the middle of the afternoon.  What's wrong with that?  I just don't like that.  Let's go to Jeff from Boston.  Hey, Jeff.  Hey, what's up, guys?  You know how to play  the movie game, right?  Yes, I do.  All right,  these two lovely ladies  are going to act out  another scene  from another great guy movie.  All right, ladies,  you ready?  Yeah.  Okay.  Now, remember,  remember,  I'll give you  a little more motivation.  All right.  Both of you,  during this,  both of you  have similar deliveries. 
[01:07:30]  You're both  yelling.  Okay.  Yelling your lines.  Okay?  Yeah, don't hold.  All right, we got you.  Don't hold back.  You're both yelling  your lines.  This is a yelling scene.  Just pretend she hid  your bottle of alcohol  and you're mad.  Who's starting?  All right.  Marion is starting the scene.  And remember,  right into the mic.  We're both yelling.  Right in,  both yelling.  And when you,  do you see the part  that is in the  little starred area?  Oh, you described to them 
[01:08:00]  what they must do  during that part.  Very good.  But I must do it.  Ready?  Action.  Go?  Yeah.  All right.  Left shoulder hut.  Private pile,  what are you trying to do  to my beloved corpse?  Sir,  I don't know, sir.  You are dumb,  private pile,  but do you expect me  to believe that?  Don't.  Left from right?  Sir.  No, sir.  Then you did that  on purpose.  You want to be different?  Sir.  No, sir.  Oh, my God. 
[01:08:30]  Hey.  She just smacked Lady Di.  Cut.  Cut.  Why did you smack Lady Di?  She's supposed to.  It's in the script.  But you know what I'm saying?  You didn't hit her hard enough.  You got to hear it.  Yeah.  So,  now Lady Di,  are you against  maybe being smacked  in the face?  All right.  What about if I don't like  to be smacked  in the face?  Hit her in the face.  No, you got to really hit her.  But hit her hard.  We're not going to do that.  I'll go like this.  Man, that face  is going to jiggle. 
[01:09:00]  You have to hit her.  You're like method actors  and for the last 30 years  you've been playing  someone that eats compulsively.  All right.  Here we go.  Hit him in stone.  All right.  Ready?  All right, ladies.  Let's start over.  Start over and remember.  It's a very short scene.  Remember,  you're yelling.  Yelling.  Very good.  Okay.  And...  We are yelling.  And...  Ready?  Action.  Left shoulder hut.  Private Pyle,  what are you trying to do  to my beloved corpse?  Sir.  I don't know, sir.  You are dumb,  Private Pyle.  Do you expect me to believe 
[01:09:30]  you don't know left from right?  Sir.  No, sir.  Then you did that on purpose.  You want to be different?  Sir.  No, sir.  What side was that, Private Pyle?  Sir.  Left side, sir.  Are you sure, Private Pyle?  Sir.  Right side, sir.  Don't F with me again, Pyle.  Pick up your F and cover, Pyle.  Sir.  Yes, sir.  You're smacking her in all the wrong spots. 
[01:10:00]  Were you paying attention?  Yes.  No, you weren't.  Where's she supposed to smack me?  I don't know.  I don't know.  She said, sir, left, sir,  and you smacked her again  and then said,  Are you sure?  All right.  Look, this is the best we can do  with this, babe.  Yeah.  Oh, my dear, sweet.  What have you done  to my beloved corpse?  What are you trying to do  with my beloved body?  My beloved corpse.  Okay.  Can I walk over and smack you?  No.  There's nothing beloved  about your corpse.  All right.  I guess Jeff from Boston. 
[01:10:30]  Jeff, if you...  Look, Jeff is disgusting.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Jeff, judging by...  deciding by what you've just heard,  what movie were they acting from?  I have no idea, man.  I'm going to have to go with a guess  and say Thin Red Line.  Oh, no.  What kind of guy are you?  Wow, man.  Not a good one, I guess.  All right.  Don't say it.  All right.  Don't say it.  Sorry.  We've got to let Jeff go.  Let's go to Mark.  Change your tampon.  Mark, what scene were they acting...  Well, what movie were they acting from? 
[01:11:00]  Was it the Trainables video?  No.  Oh, it's Full Metal Jacket.  Full Metal Jacket.  Full Metal Jacket.  Mark, hold on.  Sure.  The one time she could have saved herself  the embarrassment of saying an S in core.  Yeah, I know.  Corpse.  I ain't listening to you, Jeff.  Here's the scene.  Here it is.  For a reference point.  Well, shoulder.  Sure.  Private Pyle, what are you trying to do  to my beloved car?  Sir, I don't know, sir.  You are dumb, Private Pyle,  but do you expect me to believe 
[01:11:30]  that you don't know left from right?  Sir, no, sir.  Then you did that on purpose.  You want to be different.  Sir, no, sir.  What side was that, Private Pyle?  Sir, left side, sir.  Are you sure, Private Pyle?  Sir, yes, sir.  What side was that, Private Pyle?  Sir, right side, sir.  Don't with me again, Pyle.  Pick up your cover.  Sir, yes, sir.  Wow.  What a fantastic scene.  That was a good movie.  I saw that movie.  Well, great.  It's obvious you guys saw that movie. 
[01:12:00]  You did good with this.  Come on.  What do you want me to do?  Over really smack her?  You did good.  I've had my chair of smack and not.  You did good.  What are you trying to do to my beloved corpse?  Carp.  We don't smack each other.  Oh, wow.  Oh, wow.  Is that you?  What?  The good arm or the gimp one?  Let's have a round with you, Jim.  Don't hit me with the turkey leg arm.  Hit me with the other one.  This turkey leg arm has to put whatever we got.  Left hook and right hook.  Left hook and right hook.  I made a left hook and right hook.  You really are a marble-mouthed ass.  Yeah, I don't talk with marbles in my mouth. 
[01:12:30]  No, it would probably clarify things.  Yeah, well, obviously not, Jim.  Right.  What is wrong with you?  Did you actually have a Down Syndrome tongue implanted?  Did I have a white implanted?  Why?  Why?  I don't know.  We love you, too, Jim.  I'm not the fan gibberish.  All right, listen.  We're going to take a break.  I think we need to continue with this.  Yeah, the retard of the Vernon show.  All right.  Hey, everybody.  It's Stephen Lynch.  You're listening to the worst of Opie and Anthony. 
[01:13:00]  And also, I have herpes.  Ready to play more of the movie game in?  This is becoming a lot of fun, this game.  The first time we did it, I got him in a little bit of a clusterf, but the girls seem to have  really taken it upon themselves to brush up on their acting skills, because sometimes  I can't tell if we're listening to a movie clip or the retard of Laverne and Shirley.  Oh, yeah.  Andrew.  Hey, what's going on, guys?  All right, we've got to hurry up here, because we're running out of time, but you want to  play the movie game?  Definitely.  All right, here we go.  Girls, are you ready?  Yes, we are. 
[01:13:30]  All right.  You know your parts.  And action.  You don't know me.  You know how I earn a living.  I'll catch this bird for you, but it ain't gonna be easy.  Bad fish, not like going down to the pond and chasing bluegills.  But Tommy catch the shark.  Swallow a new hole.  Shake and tenderness.  Down you go.  Now we got to do it quick.  That'll bring back all the tourists.  That'll put all your businesses on a paying basis.  But it's not gonna be pleasant.  I value my neck a lot.  More than the 3,000 bucks.  Chief, I'll find him for three. 
[01:14:00]  I'll catch him and kill him for ten.  You gotta make up your minds.  You wanna stay alive and ain't up.  You wanna play chief and be on welfare the whole winter.  I don't want no volunteers.  I don't want no mates.  There's too many captains on this island.  $10,000 for me, myself, for that you get the head, the tail, the whole damn thing.  Thank you very much, Mr. Quint.  Well, take it under advisement.  Yeah, Marion, there's another line. 
[01:14:30]  That's it.  Wow.  I thought Mayor, Chief, ladies and gentlemen.  You have to ain't up.  Okay.  You can't even hear it, though.  You have to ain't up.  Andrew?  Yeah, she read it like...  You can't even understand what the hell she was saying.  Oh, we understood.  Aw.  You don't know...  Over the phone?  You don't know the movie?  You can't understand.  All I heard was the other one at the end.  Well, guess the movie.  Oh.  Take it under advisement.  Oh, their mics are up.  Of course they heard it. 
[01:15:00]  Everyone else heard it?  He just doesn't know.  No, I said...  He heard it.  I had to talk like Quint.  Yeah, she was just talking weird.  I had to talk like Quint.  That's actually sexier than an actual voice.  Awful.  Well, Andrew, just guess.  Uh...  Take it under advisement.  Take it under advisement.  Oh, man.  Oh, my God.  You're close.  I can see it.  I'm telling you, I really couldn't hear her, guys.  Five, four, three...  You know what?  ...two, one.  Yes?  All right.  Thanks, guys.  I can't blame him. 
[01:15:30]  Here's a reference point.  Here's the scene.  It's, of course, from Jaws.  It's Jaws.  I don't know what wacky voice you were doing there.  It was nothing like Quint.  I had to talk like the Irish guy.  All right.  Here's the scene, Ant.  You all know me.  Know how I earn a living.  I'll catch this bird for you, but it ain't gonna be easy.  It's a bad fish.  It's not like going down the pond chasing bluegills or tommy cards.  This shark, swallow you whole. 
[01:16:00]  A little shaking.  A little tenderizing.  Down you go.  And we gotta do it quick.  I don't bring back the tourists.  I don't put all your businesses on a paying basis.  But it's not gonna be pleasant.  I value my neck a lot more than 3,000 bucks, Chief.  I'll find him for three.  But I'll catch him and kill him for ten.  And you gotta make up your minds.  You wanna stay alive and ante up?  You wanna play it cheap? 
[01:16:30]  Be on welfare the whole winter.  I don't want no volunteers.  I don't want no mates.  There's too many captains on this island.  $10,000 for me by myself.  For that, you get the head, the tail, the whole damn thing.  Bravo!  Nice, right?  Robert Shaw.  One of the greatest actors ever on the face of the earth.  Taking a Pelham, one, two, three.  The deep.  The guy was fantastic. 
[01:17:00]  With that voice.  I thought he did very good.  Fantastic in that movie.  Alright, let's go right to John in Philly.  John.  Alright.  Yo, what's up?  Alright.  Ladies, you ready for your next script there?  Yeah.  Are we getting another one?  Sure.  Yeah, this is a really good one, because they both have to really work for this one.  Yeah, you're both acting in this one now.  Here's both of your lines.  Lady Di, this is your time to shine.  Okay.  Don't F up, huh?  Yeah, don't F up like John.  Hey, Marion, say something real fast.  What?  No, get on mic and say hi, John. 
[01:17:30]  Hi, John.  How you doing?  Hey.  You heard her fine, right?  Oh, she sounds great.  Hi.  I'll see you.  Yeah, that guy just didn't know the movie.  I know.  He's a faggot.  Who doesn't know Jaws, faggot?  Yeah, Jeff from Boston was a faggot, too.  He didn't want his friends going, hey, faggot, faggot.  He didn't know that it was Jaws, faggot.  I couldn't hear them.  Okay, ready?  I think this is going to be the last one, unfortunately.  Yes.  Oh, unfortunately.  Give it your all.  Unfortunately.  Yes, we will.  We'll give it your all.  There it is.  All right.  This is it, ladies.  So really, yeah, give it your all, because this is it for you. 
[01:18:00]  All right?  I go first.  And action.  Company leader calling Raven.  Company leader to Raven.  Talk to me, Johnny.  Company leaders identify Baker Team.  Rambo, Messner, Ortega, Coletta, Jorgensen, Danforth, Barry, Krakauer.  Confirmed.  This is Colonel Troutman.  Talk to me, Johnny.  They're all gone, sir.  Rambo, are you all right over?  Baker Team, they're all dead, sir.  Not Barry.  He made it.  Barry's gone, too, sir.  How? 
[01:18:30]  Got himself killed in Nam.  Don't even know it.  Castrated him down to the bone.  No, cancer ate him down to the bone.  That's what I said.  Who typed that?  Castrated.  No.  That's cancer.  All right, we're running out of time, though.  Continue.  Keep going.  I'm sorry.  I don't know.  I'm the last one, sir.  It's good to hear your voice, Johnny.  It's been a long time.  Look, John, you've done some damage here, but they don't want any trouble.  That's why I've come. 
[01:19:00]  I've got to come in there and fly you the hell out.  Just you and me.  We'll work this thing out together.  Is that fair enough?  Where'd you come from, sir?  Bragg.  I tried to get in touch with you, but the guys at Bragg never knew where to find you.  I haven't been spending much time there lately.  They've got me in D.C.  I'm sharing a seat with my ass.  My A.  Shining.  I wish I was back at Bragg now.  We'll talk about that when you come in. 
[01:19:30]  I can't do that, sir.  Well, look, John, we can't have you running around out there wasting friendly civilians.  There are no friendly civilians.  Well, I'm your friend, Johnny.  I was there with you, knee-deep in all the blood and guts.  I covered your butt more than once.  Seems like bailing you out trouble is getting to be a lifetime job for me.  There wouldn't be no trouble except for that King S. cop.  All I wanted was something to eat, but the man kept pushing, sir.  Well, you did some pushing of your own, John. 
[01:20:00]  They drew first blood, not me.  Well, let me come in and get you the hell out of there.  They drew first blood.  Look at, you hear John from Philly, our contestant moaning, just like, oh, God.  Isn't it painful?  You were wincing, John.  You were playing the scene.  Thank you, Marion and Brian Regan.  They're all gone, sir.  Sir?  Oh, they drew first blood.  Oh, I see where they're going with this one. 
[01:20:30]  I want to be back in Bragg.  They hit me with a pop tart.  All right, John from Philly, what movie were they acting out there?  That's the classic scene at the end of Rambo First Blood.  Oh, yeah, John.  Exactly.  You got it right.  Talk to me, Johnny.  And we don't have time to play the actual scene.  No, we don't.  We have run out of show.  John, hold on the line.  It's over, Johnny.  Hold on, man.  John from Philly.  Bravo.  Everybody clapping.  And that's how we wrap up a crazy week of radio, Ant.  Zainerific.  I want to thank the ladies.  Lady Di and Marion. 
[01:21:00]  Lady Di did very well there.  Yes, yes.  Thank you very much.  Very good job.  Sylvester Stallone impression.  Very nice.  Brian Regan.  Ain't going to work, Jimmy.  It kind of worked.  It did work.  He left.  He knows.  I saw his little blue eyes glance over.  Hitler would have been proud of you, blonde-haired, blue-eyed fella.  I had to confess.  I was like, oh.  I saw you.  I confess.  I confess.  That's Jimmy's line.  Those were my eyes shifting.  Who said that he rang up.  The scores told him he rang up.  It was over 50 grand, something like that. 
[01:21:30]  Yes.  Over.  Jesus Christ, Jimmy.  What?  Holy shit.  Somebody bought it.  Somebody bought it in here.  Oh, my God.  Somebody bought it in here.  The worst smell ever in my life.  Oh, my God.  Uncle Larry.  That is disgusting.  That is disgusting.  Disgusting.  Disgusting.  Disgusting.  It's in my nostrils.  Somebody bought it. 
[01:22:00]  Somebody bought it in here.  Dude, that's horrific.  Oh, Jesus.  Somebody bought it in here.  Oh, my God.  Shut up.  I can't function.  It won't stop.  Stop.  Stop.  Stop.  It's awful.  I had a burger on the metro line.  Oh, my God.  I need something I'm going to throw up.  It could be the worst one ever.  It's like rotting eggs.  Eggs.  Eggs.  Eggs.  Eggs.  Eggs.  Eggs.  Eggs.  Eggs.  XM202.  The OPN Anthony Show.  Morning, Jimmy. 
[01:22:30]  Morning, guys.  Hi, Ant.  Hi.  I forgot someone.  Who?  I don't know.  Oh, Liddy.  How you doing, Liddy?  Oh, you know.  Oh, you know.  See, he talks.  I'd be better if they'd all go back to Africa.  Hey.  Easy, Liddy.  Easy.  Otto and Liddy.  Liddy hasn't been on the show in a while.  Yeah.  He's been busy.  Yeah.  Liddy got a new tattoo.  It said, try again. 
[01:23:00]  Hey, remember the time Mars found the pickled punk, Anthony?  Yes.  We were on vacation, and he was in the back office, and he found it.  He started really freaking out because he didn't know what the hell it was.  He called Washington, the FBI, lawyers.  It was a mess.  Building security.  It was a pretty interesting story.  Interesting enough to throw it on our stupid radio program.  It was creepy. 
[01:23:30]  Then he opens the jar up and touches it.  Yes.  You remember he touched it, and the big buildup was, we've got to get Andrew Gore back.  And eventually, on a later episode, he did come back and take the pickled punk, but not  during this one.  Right.  Well, the next segment will be Andrew Gore taking back.  Oh, picking up the punk.  Okay.  Oh.  Well, we'll introduce that at the proper time.  Okay, yeah.  Not right now.  All right.  But first, Mars finds the pickled punk.  And touches it.  The worst of Opie and Anthony.  Awful.  All right.  We've got to get Danny in here. 
[01:24:00]  Danny?  I see.  You're letting the head roll a little.  A little bit.  What do you think?  That's all right.  What did you do during it?  It's like boss's awful Jew hair.  It's not bad.  I worked, Ant.  You worked?  Yeah, these guys worked.  During vacation.  These guys worked for free while they enjoyed the...  Damn, you didn't go on a cruise?  The two-week vacation.  Nope.  Nope.  I came here a couple of days.  I was helping Ziggy out with the store.  Dude, I'm walking the beach, trying to figure out if I should start smoking pot again.  I'm searching out the coconut man every day. 
[01:24:30]  I'm dining with the captain.  And these guys working for free.  Working for free.  Back in New York.  The ONA slaves.  Very good.  Well, there was a controversy.  Yes.  Yes, Danny.  What happened?  The FBI was almost involved?  Pretty much.  You guys know Mars, the engineer here.  He wanted to tell me a story.  He said it was pretty funny.  So he was telling me that somebody had moved a box that was in here into the room in the back. 
[01:25:00]  And it was apparently...  It was into one of our offices that we don't use.  All right.  One of the offices that we demanded from XM.  We demanded that they build all these offices.  Well, we have an office, but me and Opie needed another office.  That's right.  So we demanded we have an office with just two desks in it for us to get away from the riffraff.  And, you know, if you listen to this program, we make it sound like there's no one else in this facility.  It's all about Anthony and I and Jim Norton, of course.  And, you know, they had to make a lot of space for the Opie and Anthony show here in New York. 
[01:25:30]  And it was a small space to begin with.  And that wasn't good enough for us.  We're like, no, we need to take over the entire conference room.  We need the whole kitchen area as our private offices.  We need, need, need, need, need, build, build, build, or we're not coming.  Right.  So then the rest of the gang had to be shoved into tiny little cubicles.  Their space that was small to begin with got smaller.  Now the area where the coffee machine and everything was, now it takes up like a two-foot spot on a shelf.  It's pretty much their lunchroom. 
[01:26:00]  So they build these really nice offices so Ant and I can get away.  We haven't used them once.  Yeah.  So I guess a box from the studio was moved into one of these offices.  You got it.  And Mars was kind of curious of what was in the box because it was kind of bulging on the side.  What's in the box?  Tell me what's in the box.  Don't we have that somewhere?  No, I think so.  We should get it though.  No, we had it.  I played it once.  All right, go ahead.  So Mars opens the box and sure enough inside is the Pickled Punk. 
[01:26:30]  Oh, the Pickled Punk.  No.  Where do we get that from?  Andrew Gore.  Andrew Gore.  And I openly admitted that it has brought me bad luck for the two and a half years that he gave it to me.  He gave it to me like two and a half years ago and there's been some weird things that have happened in my life.  It's like the Greg Brady tiki that you wear around your neck.  And I was thinking it was in my closet in my New York apartment.  I'm thinking, you know, who knows? 
[01:27:00]  Maybe it would be smart to just give it back to the guy.  And maybe, maybe it will help my luck.  Maybe.  It is taboo.  Maybe it will help my luck.  Taboo.  So I brought it back in here because he was supposed to be in New York.  Does everyone know what a Pickled Punk is?  I don't know if all our listeners know.  It's from an old circus term.  Yeah, it's from the old side shows.  You would pay your dollar or back then, what was it, a quarter or a nickel?  A nickel?  It was like a nickel or something.  Yeah, a nickel.  And you'd go in and see these.  They're deformed fetuses. 
[01:27:30]  You know, maybe spontaneous miscarriage or something like that.  Or what, did they have abortions back then?  Who knows?  How did they get these things?  They give them cute names and stuff.  Two-headed.  Yeah, they'll have two heads and three legs.  They'll just be so deformed they'll look like Lizard Baby or something.  Yeah, the Lion Head Boy.  Things like that.  Yeah, Lion Head Boy.  And it's really disgusting.  So Andrew gave one to Opie.  Because I had a fascination about it.  I had a fascination with it and was asking for one and got one.  And in Andrew's old crib, and thank God he finally moved. 
[01:28:00]  So if the FBI wants to question me, I have no idea where he lives now.  He had a display in this old joint that was just unbelievable.  We've talked about the Siamese babies with the diapers on them.  Yeah, little diapers on them.  In a fish tank.  And these things were so old, they had really, really old locks on them and stuff from the original owners and stuff.  These things have been passed down, you know, generations.  Yeah, pickled punk.  Very funny name for it.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Dead fetus. 
[01:28:30]  Yeah.  So he finally gave me one as a little present.  Little pickled peterson.  Well, that's where this gets interesting, by the way.  Oh, Jesus.  So you found it was bringing you Babylon.  As you had it hanging around your neck when you went surfing.  No, I thought it couldn't hurt to bring it back and give it back to the owner.  Take it back.  So it's been just kind of laying around.  Did Mr. Hanalei give you directions to the cave?  Right.  And then what happened with Tiki?  Your TV dad took it and wore it around his waist. 
[01:29:00]  Well, I had a discussion.  I had a discussion with Vincent Price.  Yeah, Vincent Price.  He was in that episode.  We all went to a luau.  I do nothing wrong.  Let's do nothing wrong.  So, um...  It is taboo.  So we brought it.  I brought it back in.  Yeah.  And it ended up in a box because no one really wanted to look at it.  And then, you know, this place is kind of cluttered and it was just forgotten about. 
[01:29:30]  Yeah, I definitely did not want to look at that thing anymore.  So the box was moved to this office that Anthony and I don't use.  And then what happened?  Sorry, Danny.  Getting back to you finally.  That's all right.  So Mars opens it up, sees that it's a...  Indeed, a fetus in a jar.  And doesn't remember that you had brought this in and spoke about it on the air.  It's in a jar.  So he proceeds to freak out and grabs Poe and brings him in to ask him...  Poe wrestled it to the ground.  Unreal.  If it's fake.  They're freaking out.  Poe wants to call the police. 
[01:30:00]  Oh my God.  So Mars finds this in the back office because he had to go get something.  And he looks into the box and there's the pickled punk.  Did they ever hear us talking about this thing?  That's why I'm surprised.  Jesus.  So then Master Poe got involved and then Bruce, who runs the New York facility, got involved.  And they're all just staring at it.  Master Poe put a little gi on it.  Taught it a few kicks.  So then what happened there, Danny?  Well, apparently some calls were made down to Washington.  Uh-oh.  Oh, Jesus.  Oh, boy.  Here we go again.  That's all Washington needs now with phone calls. 
[01:30:30]  Oh, what's the problem?  Equipment things?  No, there seems to be a fetus here in...  In a jar.  In a mayonnaise jar.  Oh, God.  Looks like it might have been born this week.  Great.  Oh, boy.  And no one could figure out if it was real or fake.  And Mars decided that he just had to find out for himself.  No way.  Yep.  Are you kidding?  Put on a glove, cracked it open, and started poking it.  Why would you open that?  That hasn't been opened in decades. 
[01:31:00]  Yeah.  Probably 90 years.  If you look at it, it looks like it's plastic.  Yeah.  So he poked it and realized it is real.  Indeed.  Well, he was telling me that the night before he was in bed.  What did that feel like?  And he was just...  He couldn't fall asleep.  Oh, my God.  Am I puke?  Oh, he just hit me.  Oh, what did it feel like?  Oh, my God.  Like a raw chicken leg.  Dude, look at my arm.  Where it kind of skin moves around a little on the bone.  Yeah.  It takes a lot to get me skeeved.  I just...  I just like...  Wow. 
[01:31:30]  That was the beginnings of a puke.  That is really bad.  He was telling me the night before, he was just thinking about whether it was fake or not.  And he just could not fall asleep.  And he was just saying to himself, all right, tomorrow I'm just going to go in.  I'm just going to have to...  I've got to touch it.  You have to touch it.  You will be molested.  You will be molested.  He had to touch it.  Yeah.  So he's poking at it?  Yeah, if we want, I guess we could ask him what it felt like if you guys want to know.  Ew.  What does a pickled punk feel like?  I just like the way Danny tried to direct the show.  I kind of like that.  Yeah.  Guys, get him in here.  Are you kidding me?  Guys, get him in here. 
[01:32:00]  You bring him right in.  It's a good point, young man.  Look at all the other interns laughing.  Oh, he hasn't sucked.  They revel in others' failure.  He hasn't seen Ben in three hours.  He figured, what the hell, I'll give it a shot.  I like the fact that young Danny and his new Carmine Ragusa hair.  So what did you do when you found the pickled punk that you slide on the floor and sing  Rags to Riches?  Wow. 
[01:32:30]  Mars is in the studio.  How are you doing?  So, are you on?  I don't know.  I hit myself.  Talk again, Mars.  Hello, hello.  He's on.  He's on.  They're a little off.  I want to adjust that, Mike.  Okay.  No, not your headphone volume.  I know.  Silly.  So what happened?  You found the pickled punk in the back office?  Yeah.  And the thing was that I didn't know how I got there.  You never heard us talking about the pickled punk on the show?  Unfortunately, did not.  So my concern was that someone dropped it off maliciously because maybe we're making 
[01:33:00]  jokes of Lacey Peterson.  Oh.  So someone dropped off the pickled punk.  I'm wondering how long it took the pickled punk to fill out all the paperwork.  And Poe taking pictures of it.  It actually started when it was in the guy's balls.  It went through the whole pregnancy and the abortion and the formaldehyde.  You forgot to sign here, little thing.  And what kind of ID did the pickled punk actually have for Poe?  I need a photo ID, gentleman.  Yeah.  All right.  So after that, the first thing I did, of course, was pull Paul over and he was like, 
[01:33:30]  oh, I don't know if that's real.  And I kept saying that it is real.  And then I spoke to Bruce as well.  And you found out it was real by poking it.  Well, actually, you can tell it's real.  I've seen one of those in Germany when I was out in Germany.  Really?  Yeah.  And it looks very real.  But you still had to poke it.  Ultimately, to actually really find out if it was real. 
[01:34:00]  Actually, what part of the body did you poke?  The head.  Oh, of course.  The head.  That's good.  Did you go back into the left?  Jesus, you're poking the head of a fetus.  That's real smart.  Well, you know, I had to find out.  Again, like I said, I had no knowledge that it was here before, so I thought it was a malicious act.  So I noticed that it was very detailed.  Saw the genitals.  It's a little girl.  Ooh.  Yep.  So why did you take it out of the jar?  No, I did not.  I moved the jar around. 
[01:34:30]  You wanted to see its genitals.  That's why you touched it.  You didn't poke the head.  You opened the legs.  You sicko.  Has a little tiny anus.  Ooh.  Oh.  Nice.  Yeah, keep talking.  All the details of that.  Sure.  I love this story.  So was it preserved in Jesus juice?  Actually, I was trying to smell the...  I've never touched their fetus.  It's a formaldehyde, but it's not too much of a strong smell of formaldehyde.  It is more of an alcohol-based...  It was a mask.  But you lost sleep the night before you decided to molest this thing? 
[01:35:00]  Well, the thing was that some of my higher-ups thought that everybody wanted me to believe  that it was fake, and I was determined to prove that it was real.  Oh, it's real.  Yeah.  It's real.  It's absolutely real.  You should take a bite out of it.  You sink your teeth into, like, halfway through the head and just bite through the ears and  the bridge of the nose, and you chew it.  Oh, my God.  Stop it.  You know the stench that would come off of that into your mouth and your molars? 
[01:35:30]  Cook it up like hot wings.  No, you just eat it raw.  Just look at it.  She wasn't aborted.  You know what it would come apart like?  I don't know how many people would get this reference, but remember when Damone went to  visit his pal there, Rat, in the restaurant when he was on the date, and he bit into that  thing at the table.  He goes, hey, Rat, how you doing?  Yeah, I come here all the time.  And he bit that thing, and it kind of popped and water shot out of it.  Oh, my God.  Hey, you forgot your wallet.  You forgot your abortion over my... 
[01:36:00]  Well, Dr. Morris said that the tiny anus appeared to be of normal size and consistency, and he's  saying that it wasn't aborted.  How did you know it wasn't aborted?  Well, I think it's not aborted because you would see bruises on the fetus if it was aborted,  and there are no bruises on the fetus.  Except for the finger marks you put in its head.  No, it probably has bruises.  But isn't it gray?  No, it's whitish.  It's whitish.  It's whitish.  It's whitish, so it doesn't really have any pigment on it. 
[01:36:30]  It's well-preserved.  It's, yeah, it's disgusting.  Ugh, sandwich.  So then what happened?  What did you guys decide to do?  So ultimately, what happened was, let's drop it out the fifth floor window.  Oh, Spolat.  We spoke to D.C.  Long of our careers.  Spolat.  We spoke to D.C., and they wanted to ask one of you guys, but you guys were on vacation.  We didn't bother you.  Yes, we weren't.  We were busy on a cruise ship.  Mm-hmm.  And we'd be bothered with dead fetus questions.  So when I come in on Monday, the first person that I see is Steve, and I says, hey, Steve, 
[01:37:00]  by the way, there was a box in the back, and he says, oh, yeah, the fetus.  Oh.  And I freaked out.  I was like, oh, you know about it.  And he's, yeah, it's been with us all this time, and he explained the story to me about  Andy Gore and all that good stuff.  What happened to the fetus?  It is still in Opie's office.  Oh, it is?  Yeah, well.  Why don't you give it back?  That's just creepy.  Get that thing out of here.  I've been trying, but.  Get that goddamn thing out of here.  Give it a proper burial.  They won't let me.  Take it out on a boat off of Modesto and drop it in the water. 
[01:37:30]  They won't let me travel with it or anything.  Why?  Because you've got to pay for another ticket?  He's afraid it won't break in his bag.  You pull out a duffel bag, the fetus is stuck to the back of one of your books.  Oh, God.  You see, like, one of its little feet has fallen off.  It's got the iPod headphones on.  That'd make a great commercial.  All right, well, thanks.  You're welcome.  Yeah, thank you for that.  Thanks, Danny.  Poking. 
[01:38:00]  Poked his head.  The whole head's a soft spot, isn't it?  On something that old.  Oh, you did not come back.  He's been doing that to you for six months.  Walking back.  I'm going to poke him in the head.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  Removing the curse of the pickled punk, yes.  Ah, right.  We have a whole discussion on this pickled punk that Andy Gore gave me, personally, because  I said I had a fascination for pickled punk, so he decided to give me one as a present.  Do you still have this thing?  Why?  Oh, oh, I got you now. 
[01:38:30]  Yeah.  Oh, oh.  No, I thought you said, spite, I'm okay.  I thought, no, I thought you said, spite, I'm okay.  Here's the bit where we talk about removing the curse of the pickled punk.  Yeah.  So, hit it.  Here's Opie and Anthony when they're not awful.  Okay, terrific.  The worst of Opie and Anthony.  No more of that.  It's bad for you.  Let's go to Yukon, the trucker.  Yukon.  Hey, what's going on, fellas?  Hey, Yukon.  Hey, I want to know, Opie, what time did you bring that pickled punk to the studio? 
[01:39:00]  The punk has been here almost since day one.  Pretty much the first or second week I brought it back in from my house.  Okay, I was just thinking that maybe it was Jinx in the studio.  Maybe you should get Patrick Munnock in his nine toes to pedal down the D.C. with his  Flintstone feet.  I completely agree that the pickled punk is disrupting my life.  It's Jinxing.  And now I think it's disrupting the life of everyone in the New York facility. 
[01:39:30]  Yeah.  You know what?  I'm getting a lot of people asking about the pickled punk.  They want to take it off my hands.  Can you just give it away?  I don't know.  I don't know.  That's...  Shouldn't we get some kind of, uh, one of those people, uh, with like a...  An exorcist?  Something.  Like maybe somebody with a crystal ball or something.  Some kind of voodoo?  Yeah, maybe read the palm of the pickled punk, see what life it was supposed to have.  I think some type of decent burial is in order for the pickled punk. 
[01:40:00]  I...  Nope.  Nope.  No?  Nope.  I'm not taking a chance.  On what?  It might need a Christian, you know, burial or something.  Like you figure if you just bury it, it'll be haunting.  I don't know what religion it is.  I don't know either.  You know, I really think the only solution to the pickled punk thing is to have Andy Gore  come back and get it.  And claim it?  Yes.  He really jinxed you by giving it to you.  Because now I think he...  Maybe he had a problem with it.  Identified it as the jinx pickled punk and gave it to you. 
[01:40:30]  And now, you know, how do you get rid of it?  How do you dispose of a fetus?  I think if you give it back to the person who gave it to you, then...  Oh, is that what you're saying?  Always good.  It's never that easy in movies.  It's never that easy.  You can't just give...  Once you give somebody a bad luck thing, it's not as simple as just going,  Hi, I'm returning this.  Thank you.  Why not?  Because you've got to go through some ritual or some very difficult thing or activity  or go to some strange, faraway place that's dangerous to get to. 
[01:41:00]  That's the only way you can cure that.  Like the Brady Bunch.  We were talking about the Tiki Idol.  They couldn't just put it back.  They had to give it to Mr. Hanalei.  They had to tell him to go to the cave.  And Vincent Price was there.  It's very dangerous for the kids.  But how about we burn something in all the corners of the room?  Like sage?  Is that the thing they burn?  I think they burn sage.  But it has to be burned in every corner of the room.  You can't just walk around the place with sage burning. 
[01:41:30]  You have to burn it into each corner of the room.  How do you know that?  I do some of that reading sometimes.  What the hell?  You burn it in the corner of a room?  Yeah.  It gets rid of the badness.  I thought you just had to wave it around.  No, you don't just wave sage around.  I'm learning something new here.  Of course not.  You burn it and then you make sure it hits every corner of the room.  Someone will back me up on this one.  I'm not denying it.  I'm just saying I don't think that will work unless you get rid of the pickled punk first in the appropriate fashion. 
[01:42:00]  I think as soon as we get rid of the pickled punk, all is going to be good with the show.  Could you imagine you get rid of it and everything miraculously just works here in the studio?  Oh.  All of a sudden we have no, we're not butting heads with anybody at XM anymore.  It's just everything is fine with the world.  You've got to get rid of that thing.  I blame it on the pickled punk.  It is the pickled punk.  That nasty little face.  What do we do? 
[01:42:30]  I think.  Give it back.  I think we just give it back.  But there's got to be some kind of ceremony.  I think we give it back with some kind of ceremony with maybe some sage burning in the corners of the room.  Burning sage in the corners of the room.  Yep.  Give it back.  I like it.  Yeah.  The sage, you kind of sold me with the sage.  Because I'm thinking you can't just give it back but a little sage.  But there's something missing.  I think we need to all come into work one day with robes.  With hoods.  Maybe like a robe with a purple hood.  And then we all just walk around with the sage. 
[01:43:00]  Ah.  Oh.  Oh.  Something like that.  And you guys will follow me.  Whoa.  Turn the lights back on.  You're freaking me out, man.  You're scaring me.  Holy shit.  I was turning the lights down.  And I didn't even know you were turning the lights down.  I'm like, what the fuck is going on in here?  Yeah.  Okay.  All right.  Sage.  Sage.  Hoods.  Hoods.  But there's no real element of danger involved.  Usually there's some kind of danger that has to be involved when we're turning these evil things. 
[01:43:30]  Getting rid of it.  Well, we could all like, I don't know.  Eat pea soup and see what happens.  See if we vomited back up.  See if someone's head starts spinning around the room.  In evil fashion.  No, we're all going to get robes with hoods.  Yeah.  With some kind of weird like...  Oh, an emblem?  Some kind of weird emblem.  That's just silly.  That might be either good or bad.  We don't even know.  You know?  Like the druids?  Maybe with like some kind of a star.  Like a half...  No, a half moon.  Half moon?  Half moon, a star, and a plus sign. 
[01:44:00]  Nope.  Plus sign?  No pentagram, though.  No, no, no.  No evil.  No, because we all know what that is.  Yeah.  It has to be some kind of emblem.  You really don't know what it is.  Okay.  But you know it's going to work.  And then you guys will have to follow me around the room as I'm burning the sage into each  corner of the room.  How come we're involved in this?  It's your punk.  Yeah, but obviously it's affected the show.  It's affected this place.  You know, people's lives are a little strange these days. 
[01:44:30]  Now the punk has been touched, though, by Mars.  Yeah, that's not good, but I had nothing to do with that.  But I had nothing to do with someone actually poking the pickled punk.  Poking it.  All right.  You might have been sleeping and stuff, and now you woke him up.  Hey, look, we're looking up emblems online.  Yeah, I like that one.  I like the cross symbol with like the noose at the top.  Is that called an onk?  I have no idea.  How the fuck do you know it was an onk?  Forget Aristotle and fuck Socrates.  Here comes Professor Anthony. 
[01:45:00]  I just know it has a cross with like a noose thing at the top.  And you know, do you know how to spell it?  No, I'm awful at spelling, Opie.  All right.  No, sorry.  All right.  That's one thing Professor Anthony needs to study is his spelling skills.  Thank God for spell check.  God, and I used to get railed.  When I used to ask the right things.  I use spell check now.  I defy you to find misspelling in the past even couple of years, I would say. 
[01:45:30]  Well, I could break out the XM satellite radio contract.  I think you barely spelled your name right.  I was probably drunk at the time.  All right.  So I understand years ago I was, you know, very bad.  And when I had to write things, oh, it's just awful.  Now spell check is so easy.  Just pop it right in there.  It calls you an idiot.  Gives you the right spelling.  You move on.  You look like a genius.  All right.  We've got to figure out something with this pickled punk.  Look, it's obvious.  Yeah, I am a little, I'm a little frightened. 
[01:46:00]  It has really kind of put a damper on the show.  Thank you.  Why did you even ask for it?  It's the worst thing you could possibly have is a fetus staring at you through a glass jar.  It's cool if you go over, what's his, Andrew's house and, you know, go on his tour of all  of his pickled punks.  But to have one, you don't want to have one.  Nah.  You walk through a freak show, you look at the bearded lady, you're not thinking of taking  her home.  You just kind of look at it, admire it as a freak and move on. 
[01:46:30]  And all kidding aside, a lot of bad things happened after I got to Pickled Punk.  Yeah.  So I'm partly serious here, by the way.  I don't want to give you the laundry list, but it was a really bad two and a half years.  But there's no guidelines as to what you do with it to get rid of any evilness that might  be spread around.  In the movies, it's easy.  They go, oh, and I'm reading in this book that you have to do A, B, C, D.  All right.  Well, why don't we go down to one of those ancient bookstores somewhere in the village?  And maybe talk to the person behind the counter and they'll go, oh, yeah. 
[01:47:00]  Who's been alive for like 400 years, but he still fits into society.  Right.  That's mysterious.  Yeah.  And then maybe he could direct us to a book.  Yeah, a book that he has to go, oh, I got just what you need.  And he goes in the back and all of a sudden comes out with this book with a leather case  or something.  Necromonicon, yeah.  Yeah.  And this goes, blows it off.  And there's the title of the book.  Yeah.  And it's perfect for our situation. 
[01:47:30]  And then you thumb through.  Pickle punk removal.  Pickle punk removal section.  There's never a, it's never like that.  You never, it's never that simple.  I can't wait to start smoking pot again because this sounds great.  It's like the old Asian guy in Gremlins downstairs.  Yeah.  You got to kind of, you know, find an out of the way spot.  We have to go to a bookstore somewhere.  It's an out of place bookstore, but the guy has to have some kind of like, like long beard.  Long, weird beard.  Long, weird beard. 
[01:48:00]  And it can't just be an old bookstore.  It's got to be like an occult place though, doesn't it?  No.  Where they sell like books and charms.  That's the beauty of it.  It could just be an old bookstore.  The Gremlins guy.  He was just kind of in this cool little shop.  This little shop.  And then it had that, you know, yeah, exactly.  All right.  So it's an old bookstore.  Yeah.  But it can't be like a Borders or something.  Nah, nah.  It's got to be like an independent bookstore.  Independent.  You can't like go in there and get some coffee.  Nah, nah.  An independent bookstore that might have some children's books off to the side a little bit. 
[01:48:30]  Really?  Yeah, just a little bit.  Just to create the illusion.  Oh, that is legit.  And you might be using this bookstore for other things.  But then what's like the secret word to let the guy know, look, we need a little more  than what you're showing out here.  A scar on my body.  What?  I don't even, what?  Some kind of scar on my body.  And you show it and he goes, oh, I got what you need.  Exactly.  And he goes around back.  And he's been waiting a very long time for me to show up. 
[01:49:00]  Like his whole life.  Isn't going to work?  His whole life has been just waiting for this moment where I show up to show the scar.  What scar do you have?  I don't know.  I got like this.  I got a really bad scar from when I was a kid where I tried to open an orange juice can.  That is an issue.  You mean that back then you were opening an orange juice can and that was sealing your  fate back then?  Who knows?  Now I'm starting to think.  It has to be something odd.  And I tried to push the lid down and the edge of the orange juice can almost took my whole 
[01:49:30]  thumb off.  Look, it's still there 20 some odd years later.  Dude, that means nothing.  It would have to be some kind of strange occurrence.  If the orange juice lid mysteriously flung off the counter and zipped like a saw blade into  your finger, that's one thing.  You're opening up a can as a kid and that's putting this high sign scar on your thumb to  show the guy in the shop?  I believe it set me down the road and it brought us to this moment. 
[01:50:00]  You're going to put your thumb up and he's going to be like, yeah?  What can I help you with, sir?  You know what?  I never really noticed what this scar spells out or something.  Maybe we should get a little ink and I'll press it down on a piece of paper to see what  it's all about.  By the way, that's going to be my new autograph when we go out.  Oh, is that it?  Yeah.  Just going to dip it in ink and give a thumbprint of your orange juice lid scar.  Because now the scar, because we've talked about it on the radio, is very famous.  We have learned that if you talk about something, it gets famous. 
[01:50:30]  How many people are going to ask me to see the scar now?  Let me see the orange juice.  Out and about.  There it is.  The orange juice can't scar.  All right.  So you're with me or what?  No, not with the scar.  I was up to you.  I was with you.  I'm feeling it because I want to get rid of this too.  But the scar thing.  All right.  What are you feeling?  Are you feeling like some weird emblem thing on our purple rose?  Oh, that's good.  No, because we've got to walk into the place and have some kind of weird emblem.  Maybe something around your neck.  Like a necklace thing or a ring or something that. 
[01:51:00]  I got this cool thing on my, this cool cross thing that I wear all the time.  It's a cross.  Which, by the way, I've been walking around Manhattan and really bothering people.  I just will hold it up and go, for the Pope, for the Pope.  Really?  Yeah.  And they look at you like you have three heads.  Yeah.  This pot thing is going to work out just nicely.  You think it's going to be good?  Yeah.  I've got to start smoking that pot again.  I'm thinking a ring.  Some kind of ring that you've got to give the guy something and he sees the ring and goes,  Oh, okay.  Like a decoder ring?  Yeah.  Something like that. 
[01:51:30]  Maybe I have something in my apartment that is the missing piece of some kind of ancient puzzle.  Well, somebody has it in their possession, of course, because fate would have delivered it to you years ago for just this moment.  Unlike your stupid orange juice hand scar, it would actually mean something.  So I should look for some kind of...  Have you come across any piece of jewelry or something with an emblem on it that you probably would like,  Why am I keeping this?  I should throw it away, but you just keep it and it's a little weird.  Well, I got a shark tooth necklace when I was in the Bahamas over vacation. 
[01:52:00]  Yeah, that's...  No.  Seemed like just a thing to buy, but maybe that was it.  You know what probably would have been it?  That finger bone necklace that you got years ago.  Dude, that's buried.  You buried it where?  In my parents' backyard.  See?  You got to dig that up.  No way am I digging that up.  And wear that to the bookshop.  Of course.  It makes total sense now.  It was always the finger bone.  I had a human finger bone necklace, yes, that Chuck Farnham gave me. 
[01:52:30]  Chuck Farnham was selling these things.  He actually went to...  I know exactly where that is.  A supplier.  I did bury that.  Of bones, of human bones.  He called it cannibal wear.  And Opie, in his sick fascination, once again, decided he was going to get one of these things.  He wore it for a while, but noticed it stunk.  He would sit, doing the radio show, sniffing this thing all day.  To my disgust, he'd hold this finger bone up to his nose and just...  He'd be sniffing it all day long.  Maybe it's the missing bone that brings some kind of skeleton to life. 
[01:53:00]  Oh, now you're getting a little far-fetched.  Why not?  You think that would be it?  But I think it's the bone that you have to wear around your neck to show the guy at the bookstore  that's going to then let him know what we need to get rid of the bad karma and the fetus.  Okay.  The pickled punk.  I think you've got to dig up the finger bone.  You know where it is?  Yeah, I do.  It's still got the leather around it?  It's kind of buried in the pet cemetery section of our backyard. 
[01:53:30]  Really?  Yeah.  Oh, great.  You could dig up a cat bone by mistake.  The guy's going to go, that's a cat bone.  I can't help you.  It could be...  I think it's...  Yeah, I think it's buried close to one of my cats that we buried or one of the goldfish  we lost.  Did you bury it with the rawhide that tied around?  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, I don't know.  Did you put it in a box or did you just bury it in the dirt?  No, man.  Let nature take its course.  All right.  Well, it could still...  I don't think it decomposed that fast.  How long ago did you bury it?  Dude, that's years ago, right? 
[01:54:00]  Yeah.  I'm trying to remember.  Probably three, four, maybe.  Oh, at least.  Could be five years ago.  I think it's five years.  Dude, you've got to dig it up now and put it around your neck and we've got to go to  the bookstore.  Imagine I walk in with my hair all askew like Ben and I've got this necklace around my neck  that says rotting and dirty.  But that'll tip him off.  Little maggots crawling all over him.  And it makes sense because it's not easy.  All right, it's not all that difficult, but it's not something sitting around like the 
[01:54:30]  scar on your thumb.  You've got to go back.  You've got to find where you buried it.  You've got to dig up this thing that's been gone for years now.  It's a human bone.  Buried.  Dig it up.  Put it back around your neck.  Now we've got to go to the bookstore.  Now it's all coming together.  This makes sense now.  So the guy is going to recognize the bone necklace?  He'll see the bone necklace.  Then he'll know what our problem is because this whole thing is tied together.  So then he'll get that book that no one has really looked for.  And then in there will be the instructions how to get rid of this pickled punk and the 
[01:55:00]  bad luck that it has brought.  This is beautiful.  This is going to work.  All right.  Dig it up.  When are you going out?  What if I can't find it?  You have to.  I will always find it in the movies.  I will try to find the bone necklace.  I've got to find it.  Opie Potter will be out on this weekend.  It's our only hope.  Can we see the pickled punk today?  No. 
[01:55:30]  I don't want to look upon it.  I don't want to look upon it anymore.  I just want to make sure Mars didn't wreck it by poking it too hard.  Dude, don't look at it.  Leave it sealed up in the box.  Is it still in the box?  Do not gaze upon it.  I don't think it's cool that we disrespected the pickled punk.  What's this wee shit?  I didn't touch it.  I want whatever's in charge of the pickled punk to know.  No.  Get it out of here.  Dude, you're suffocating it.  Let it breathe.  No.  Let the pickled punk breathe. 
[01:56:00]  No.  Let it see the light.  Dude, why are you doing this?  Get it out of here.  Why is it sealed up like that?  Are you guys sending it to the FBI?  It's got a rubber band around the box.  It says,  Punk, this side up with an arrow.  What disrespect?  The punk has to see.  Has to see.  Oh, God.  No.  No.  If he sees, then he does.  Put the punk back.  It's in a box.  For some reason, it's got this mystic rubber band around it that holds in. 
[01:56:30]  It's able to hold him in.  You know, usually it's in some chain with an ancient lock of, you know,  something that holds it in.  And if you take that off, then the evil gets out.  This is a rubber band from the supply closet.  Shouldn't it be some kind of ancient lock where only one person has the key?  Dude, that should be in some crafted wooden box with carved emblems on it with some weird lock.  It's ancient golden lock with a key that is only held by the high priest of blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. 
[01:57:00]  Who could just be one of our interns, and we didn't know he was a high priest.  It's in a goddamn iPod box with a rubber band around it.  What?  No wonder it's pissed.  We stink as being sorcerers.  Years ago, this thing, for years, this thing has been on this earth.  This punk, we've been told, could be, it's at least 90 years old, could be over 100 years old.  And it's been here on this earth. 
[01:57:30]  Think of where it's been.  What it's seen.  What it's been contained in.  And it ends up in 2005 in a cardboard box with a rubber band around it.  Of course it's pissed.  We're not giving it the respect it deserves.  That's why I think we have to get it out of the box immediately.  No, no.  Immediately.  Look, keep it in the box.  Let it get some sunlight today.  It's pissed off, but you've got to leave it where it is.  You don't just pull it out all pissed.  We've got to figure, you've got to dig up that bone. 
[01:58:00]  We've got to go to the bookstore.  Where's the bookstore?  I don't know.  That's part of the mystery.  We're going to be going into 10 bookstores and go, hello, to the counter guy.  And he's going to be like, can I help you?  And then you'll just tap the bone with your finger.  Are the hardy boys still working?  Perhaps you haven't seen this around my neck, sir.  That's lovely.  What can I help you with?  Yeah.  What?  How? 
[01:58:30]  I will be so disappointed if somebody doesn't look upon that bone around your neck and go,  oh, I know what you need.  And I just know it's not going to work because shit like this never works.  Maybe we should just, you know, just, I don't know, to finish this up, maybe we should just  come up with our own ceremony and hope for the best.  It's got to be based on something, though.  You know, it's got to be based on some ritual that's tried and true.  It's got to be some kind of burial ritual.  I think, I think, I don't want to keep, you know, pounding this into the ground, but 
[01:59:00]  I think we have to give it back to Andy Gore with some kind of ceremony.  Right.  Okay.  You have to give it back to that.  I can't take the responsibility of thinking it needs a burial.  Right.  No, I agree with you on that, but this needs to be some type of ceremony, whether it was  a burial ceremony or some other kind of, a passing of the, a passing of the.  Somewhere along the line, the link was broken.  Right.  So, the link was broken when Andy Gore gave it to me. 
[01:59:30]  Right.  So, I had to give it back to Andy Gore.  The punk belongs to certain people.  It's their fate to possess the punk throughout history.  Andy, of course, is one of those people that is meant to possess the punk.  You, on the other hand, were not.  Obviously.  You weren't meant to.  So, we bring it back to Andy.  So, Andy gets it back.  And then he'll find the next person that was really supposed to have this thing.  Right.  Or actually, it just happens.  Like, how did Andy get it? 
[02:00:00]  I don't know.  Do you remember?  You didn't even get a history of this punk before you got it?  You're taking possession of something that's probably a century old, and you didn't get  a history like, all right, where did it come from?  It's not even a good pickled punk.  Shh.  It's a fine punk.  It's a fine punk.  It's a fine punk.  Shh.  Landry will hear you.  There are witches.  There are witches.  I love that Star Trek.  That's like two episodes, but...  Landry will hear you. 
[02:00:30]  It's a wonderful punk.  Someone's suggesting we bury the punk next to Chester.  No, Chester isn't buried.  Chester is cremated in an urn, by the way, and for you people that are keeping track, my  ex-mother-in-law has kept Chester's ashes, and when she passes, she has told people she  wants the ashes buried with her.  There you go.  All right.  Someone wants Pat from Menachie to drive it down to Louisiana. 
[02:01:00]  Someone wants to know if Andy Gore's been having good luck ever since he gave me the  punk.  Someone is saying give the punk a proper burial.  And, of course, Pat from California, send the punk to Scott Peterson.  Oh, Jesus.  He knows how to get rid of him.  Melanie from Cleveland says, don't go digging up any bones.  I'll write a spell for you.  It will take care of everything.  And, yes, you can find spells and witchcraft books at Borders.  Or go to a metaphysical shop. 
[02:01:30]  A few candles, a spice, and a chant, and it will be okay.  What kind of spice?  Not a little witch.  Is it sage?  Yeah.  What am I going to use?  A little cinnamon?  If you guys want a cinnamon.  Oregano.  Oregano.  Take the fetus.  Now add a little oregano.  This is going to be wonderful.  We're going to get rid of all the evilness that has entered your life.  Take this.  Now add a little cumin and some cinnamon on here.  Wonderful.  Now whisk the little guy up with some. 
[02:02:00]  What spice do you use?  Yeah, you can't just.  Now put the blender on fruit, hey.  I got a really good spice that makes your pizza taste really good.  Oh, maybe that'll work.  It's kind of like a, I think it's called like a pizza spice.  I'm going to take the bite out of the head that Jimmy described yesterday.  It'll be tasty.  It has a little red pepper in it and a little oregano and some other things.  I don't think we'll be putting any spice in it.  Well, if you guys want to send in your chants, maybe we can pick the best one.  A chant?  Is that what she said? 
[02:02:30]  Yeah, do a chant.  Someone says, Rev from Wackbag, I'll be seeing Andy at the end of the month at the Chiller Theater  Convention.  That's all well and good, but I'm not trusting anyone else.  Because if you'd like, I'll personally deliver it to him.  You know that I know him and I'm a faithful ONA fan.  I wouldn't lie to you.  No, we understand.  And I would truly trust Rev to do this, but I don't think that works.  Because then it would be Opie breaking the chain by giving it to Rev, who then gives it back. 
[02:03:00]  So Rev gets rid of the bad luck, but Opie still has it because you broke the chain.  And what if Rev is crossing the street and all of a sudden just kind of trips?  Oh, boy.  It happens.  Spolash.  Exactly.  How do you clean that up?  The punk is now breathing nicely.  God damn it, I looked at it!  You motherfucker.  It's, uh, you know one of those seats where the listeners kind of take a look at us as  we broadcast our show?  The Pickled Punk is sitting up nice.  All is good with the world, at least for this moment. 
[02:03:30]  Oh, God, could you please get rid of that thing?  Oh, my God.  Why did you take it out of the box?  It had to get...  Put it back in the box.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  Gang, no surprise here.  Now's the proper time, see?  Is it the proper time to tell everyone that this is the whole day where Andrew Gore took  back the Pickled Punk?  Yeah.  A lot of people were expecting some kind of a ceremony or something and know what happened?  Hey, Pickled Punk, here.  Take it.  Yep. 
[02:04:00]  That was it.  And he took it with his allegedly big cock and those two hot chicks.  Katie Ketchup and Jungle Jim Kim.  Oh, yeah, okay.  God, how hot are those two?  It bugs me.  Hopefully, we had some funny things to say during this segment.  Yeah.  I'm going to sit back and listen.  He's up on the gay shit.  Oh, Jim.  The worst of Opie and Anthony.  Old friend in the studio, guys.  Andy Gore.  I'm sorry to make you wait, Andy.  Hey, no problem.  We haven't even really taken any breaks today on this show.  It's very strange.  We've only taken two breaks for some reason.  Just nonstop banter. 
[02:04:30]  Banter.  Goofy banter.  Good fun banter.  You're in town for something?  Probably, right?  Got done doing the Chiller Theater.  Yes.  Or the TV Expo.  Who was there?  I love hearing the list of celebrities that show up.  Oh, the regulars.  Lou Ferrigno was there.  Lou Ferrigno.  Incredible Hulk.  Horse.  Stepped on my toe.  Did he?  Yeah, by accident.  Probably heard.  Made a good story, though.  You yelled, ow, and you didn't hear us.  Didn't hear, huh?  Wow.  He blew off our show.  We were supposed to interview him. 
[02:05:00]  Yeah, from New Orleans, I think.  We have a brilliant booker that's helping out this program.  They book an interview with Lou Ferrigno while we're at Mardi Gras.  Yeah.  The loudest place on earth.  We can't even hear ourselves think, and we're going to interview a guy that has problems hearing.  That's Steph.  Yeah.  So, he never called, so.  No, he blows off.  We never had to go through that hell.  Who else is over there?  Uh, they had, uh.  Linda Blair?  Nah, she wasn't there this time.  They had, uh, Tonya Harding was there.  Tonya Harding? 
[02:05:30]  Tonya Harding was there, yeah.  For what?  Because she's a, uh, basically I think this brought her in as like an oddity.  Yeah, most of it is like, um, for horror movie stuff.  Yeah, you know.  But they bring in these.  They bring in like some fringe actors from like, you know, Conrad Brooks from Plan 9,  this obscure little film from the 50s.  Yeah, of course.  You know, he's milking his nine lines.  Yeah, they get like women, uh, I saw a couple of women that were in, like as a peripheral  character in a Twilight Zone episode, and they show up and they're signing things. 
[02:06:00]  Yeah.  What horror film has Tonya Harding done besides Jeff Gullulli chasing her with that monster  cock?  Those cone titties.  She ballooned up.  She's getting a little big, huh?  I didn't even get to see her.  I was so busy up in the booth.  Yeah.  I didn't get down.  She's doing some of that boxing now.  But, uh, she was there, um, I got a sign.  People are gonna smack you in the head.  Okay.  Just trying to get the last bit of goodness.  Yeah, everyone knows that you're trying to get the last bit of goodness. 
[02:06:30]  I read it on instant feedback.  Every time you eat.  Oh, and knock it off.  But when you guys eat, it's not a problem?  There you go.  Jim starts every show with a mouthful of food.  I can't help it.  I'm hungry.  And I get nervous.  I get scared.  God damn it.  You're gonna...  You always...  You never travel alone.  That's why I like you.  No.  Yes.  Now, who are the lovely ladies?  Lovely ladies.  I recognize one girl from last time.  This is Katie Ketchup.  Hello.  Katie Ketchup.  Katie Ketchup. 
[02:07:00]  She has a ketchup fetish.  Really?  Yeah.  What?  Yeah, she's all about her ketchup.  Look, she's got ketchup.  Hold on.  Andy, we love you, but...  That's pretty cool, yeah.  Give her a mic.  You gotta step up to a mic.  She's gotta...  I mean, her name's Katie Ketchup, and she has a ketchup fetish.  I'm like, eh, whatever.  But then she shows us the...  She's got a lot of work on her arms, tattoos and stuff, and she's got a tattoo of a ketchup  bottle.  Yeah.  Yeah, I put ketchup on almost everything, and so I've got a ketchup bottle right there, 
[02:07:30]  and it has the rays that are around the Virgin of Guadalupe.  Right.  So that is like your Virgin of Guadalupe.  Yeah, it's my sacred bottle of ketchup.  Yep.  You're an odd bird.  That is something...  What...  What...  You're way too hot to have a ketchup fetish.  I like that.  Is there anything you wouldn't put ketchup on?  Yeah.  Like...  Yeah.  Um...  Chocolate.  Chocolate.  Chocolate.  Chocolate.  Ice cream.  Yeah.  What would you think is the oddest thing you've put ketchup on?  Uh...  Chicken. 
[02:08:00]  Chicken.  Chicken.  That's not that crazy, though.  It's almost like a barbecue sauce type thing, but it's not normal.  Yeah, most people wouldn't do that.  Macaroni and cheese.  It's not a sexual fetish, it's just like an obsession.  It's an obsession.  It's an obsession.  Like, uh, somebody went out and got her a hamburger the other day and came back and  she was like, did you get ketchup?  And they had like six, six little things of it.  She was like, that's not enough.  And she like ran downstairs to the restaurant and got like a tub of it.  Like you really drenched it? 
[02:08:30]  I mean, it was like a big...  Why ketchup?  It's almost like an OCD to like tweet.  I mean, we all love ketchup.  I do.  I'll say it.  Yeah, sure.  So if you have a burger, how many of those little packets do you need?  It depends on the size of the burger, but usually I need at least six.  Six?  Mm-hmm.  Just so it's running out the sides and everything.  Six isn't a lot.  Well, I put it in a pile and then I dip the burger in.  Because I don't like it getting all over my clothes.  I'm all about the dip.  Right.  Because it starts crawling down your arms and stuff. 
[02:09:00]  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't like soggy food.  I'm a dipper with my burgers now.  After two bites, your arm looks like the inside of a boat in Modesto.  Yes, it does.  A ketchup fetish.  I've never heard of that before.  A ketchup freak.  It's awesome.  That's the point she's got the tattoo.  That's a commitment to ketchup.  Yep.  Once you start tattooing yourself with them.  And there's another lovely gal over there who I didn't meet last time.  Not that I'm hitting on her, of course.  Oh, no.  Unless she's got low self-esteem, then I am.  No, come on up.  This is Jungle Jim Kim. 
[02:09:30]  She works for me.  She's one of the new girls.  And she loves mustard.  Yes, she does.  Wouldn't that be a weird little twist in this whole thing?  They can battle it out.  How do you feel about mustard?  How do I feel about mustard?  Yeah.  No.  Me?  Yeah.  I like it sometimes.  Yeah?  But not like ketchup?  Nah, no.  Just a little bit here and there.  All right.  Mayonnaise?  I don't really care for mayonnaise.  Yeah.  Barbecue sauce?  Yes, I like barbecue sauce.  Yeah, it's close to ketchup, right?  I hear you.  You like tomatoes? 
[02:10:00]  Yes.  Yeah.  It's a whole tomato.  Green ketchup?  No.  That's odd.  Purple?  No.  What's your favorite ketchup?  I'm a big Heinz 57.  I'm not a big fan of Hunts.  I like Heinz.  I would think if she tattooed Heinz on that.  Oh, I didn't notice.  I don't like the Hunts.  It annoys me.  It doesn't taste like good ketchup.  I know.  Hunts is the best.  Trying to sound like Heinz.  What's that?  Hunts is like trying to sound like Heinz, I think.  Yeah.  Like, get me some Heinz ketchup.  I thought you said Hunts.  Hunts.  Yeah.  You're such a hunt.  Very good. 
[02:10:30]  And, well, we haven't met you.  Wait, miss, don't be shy.  Jungle Jim Kim.  Hi, Jungle Jim.  Jungle Jim Kim.  I met this lovely young girl at a horror convention.  Horror.  Horror.  Horror.  You got my hopes up there.  Yeah, I know.  In Baltimore.  Yeah, about a few years ago.  Balmore.  Balmer, hun.  And I was just like, wanted to screw herself.  Wow.  Yeah, I just thought she was really cute and I talked to her.  Dude, you got some hot women that travel around. 
[02:11:00]  Damn.  They just come.  How tall are you?  How tall am I?  I don't know.  Five, six, five, seven.  Five, six, five, seven.  Yeah.  Brown hair.  Very sexy.  Very sexy.  A lovely gal.  Oh, thank you.  I think Andy Gore is a huge hog.  This is really bugging me.  You think?  He keeps doing a jar of formaldehyde.  Yes, I do.  Back to his bed.  Do you get to have sex with these ladies?  No.  I keep it on a professional level.  There you go.  That's going to be tough, right?  Yeah.  It's difficult, but the problems with these girls is that they're smart and they're really 
[02:11:30]  good workers.  Oh, boy.  They work their ass off.  Then we better not talk to them anymore because we have really bad interviews with intelligent  women.  Full job.  Yeah.  I mean, they're good workers.  They must really draw in the people to the booth.  They draw in the people.  They don't slack.  I mean, I don't drive because I'm a fucking gimp.  And they do all driving and just work 15-hour days with me and dress up and wear high heels  and kill the feet all day long.  Yeah, very sexy outfits.  Yeah.  And it's just a whole part of the show, of my show. 
[02:12:00]  We'll get some images up on opandanthony.com for later today.  Yeah.  So, Andy, what else is going on with you?  Nothing.  Just that, you know, chiller theater show where I set up, you know, the same side show and  sold a bunch of, you know, crap I made.  You're okay with being away from home?  Yeah.  Well, this is my job, basically.  You know, like I'm touring, basically.  That's what I look at it when I go to your shows.  Right on.  So it doesn't freak you out or nothing?  No.  You know, it's kind of, it's a pain in the ass and hotel beds and fucking... 
[02:12:30]  For the new listeners, Andy's got...  He's got some serious OCD issues as well.  Way OCD.  Hey, do you get one room together?  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Uh-huh.  Yeah.  Yep.  So you get to see them walking around after they get out of the shower and stuff?  Yeah.  A little peek here and there.  A little peek.  Oops, I didn't know you were still in there.  A little peek.  Good life.  Huh?  That's a great life.  I'm, you know, chasing them around.  Your girls catch them jacking a little bit, maybe, in the night?  You hear...  You get back, oh, well, the special ones will get the naked dance. 
[02:13:00]  They will get the Andy Gordon naked dance.  Really?  Which is frightening with my Auschwitz chic physique.  You do the naked dance for them?  Unfortunately.  Yeah.  I have not seen the naked dance yet, but apparently I'm going to be seeing that soon.  She needs to earn the naked dance.  Well, catch up, lady.  What's the naked dance all about?  Uh, it's, uh, skinny and scary and...  Does he have a big hog?  Uh, it's huge.  Yeah. 
[02:13:30]  Okay, yeah.  Is it really?  It's massive.  I was right.  Does he flap it around when he dances?  No, it's like a third leg.  Does he tuck it and go, oh?  Would you...  I come out doing the man giant and then just let it pop out like a turtle head.  There you go.  Awesome.  Turn around and show the fruit bowl.  Yeah.  We got Adam from PA on the line.  He's got a good question.  Adam, go ahead.  Hey, guys.  How you doing?  Pretty good.  Hey, I wanted to ask Katie, um, have you ever put ketchup on a hot dog and have it scream  at you?  Have you ever put ketchup on a hot dog and have it scream at you? 
[02:14:00]  The hot dog.  They'll tend to do that if you're maybe taking acid or it's 1967.  No, everything's been cool so far.  Cool.  Yeah, maybe you have to put some relish and...  Meh, mustard on it.  Ugh.  That woman.  We got to play that one of these days.  Yeah, we can play that again.  The last time we played that.  I love that thing.  All right.  So what...  You brought some stuff, Andy?  I know you brought something that was creeping some of the guys out.  Oh, he's having a headphone problem.  Uh-oh.  Maybe the naked man. 
[02:14:30]  All right, calm down, man.  There you go.  Okay.  The beauty of these girls, too, is if, like, one happens to get pregnant, you could  just point at the jar and go, well, you know.  Yeah, another exhibit.  Yeah, I keep the baseball better after.  Wow.  Every girl he gets pregnant, his inventory goes up.  Yeah.  That's great.  It's an abortion.  We can write that off.  I just brought some stuff to give to Jim.  Oh, thank you.  Oh, look at that.  It's a little nut sack.  You gave me that one already.  Elephantitis.  I don't know.  It was a couple years ago.  Oh, Jesus Christ.  I'm repeating myself.  Wait, explain it, Andy.  It's the radio.  It's a...  It's a pillow.  It's a pillow. 
[02:15:00]  Two-foot-tall pillow of a gentleman with elephantiasis of the balls.  He looks like he's, what is it called?  A hoppity-hop or a hippity-hop?  Yeah, totally.  Yeah.  Whatever they're called.  It looks like he's sitting on one of those.  Yes.  Yeah, like a producer for the Opie and Anthony show.  Yeah.  But upside down.  Where did his schlong go?  What happens is that all this is lymph.  It's the clear stuff in your blood.  It inflames the scrotum and the penis resides.  It recedes up into it.  And it could stretch out that big? 
[02:15:30]  It could stretch out that big.  Ow!  It's as big as, like, one of those workout balls, you see.  Yeah, it's huge.  It's sitting on it.  It's a parasite that crawls in in their ween when they're in the tropics.  I'm getting that horrible, tingly feeling down there.  The blood all rushes to it?  Yeah.  Oh, not that one.  We'll put that in our office.  Oh, yeah, totally.  It's called the layback on the sack.  All right.  Layback on the sack.  Very good.  That's nice.  Oh, yeah, this is what Kate wants to give Norton.  What is it? 
[02:16:00]  It's from Kim and I.  Oh, from the girls.  From the girls.  Nice.  Woo!  It's what I just made to go with these up.  Oh, it's a coffee mug?  Oh!  Ah!  How beautiful is that?  Who is it?  Ed Gain.  My first Ed?  Ed Gain, yeah.  Oh, that's fantastic.  He's a good one.  It has a picture of him in his red hat, which I love the color in the red hat.  And it's got a beautiful upside-down nude torso, which is sliced from crotch to back. 
[02:16:30]  And the little head seems to be missing.  Oh, turn that around.  Let me see.  Look at that.  Oh, yeah.  Look at that.  Wow, that is really sick.  There was an interview I read about Ed Gain, and they said, they asked him,  what do you think when you see a pretty girl?  I think it was Ed Gain.  And he said, I wonder what it would be like to go on a date with them.  And they said, well, what else do you think?  He goes, I think, wonder what their head would look like on a stick.  That was the process of what he thought.  That's it.  Go on a date, head on a stick.  You've got to respect that.  You've got to.  This is fantastic. 
[02:17:00]  Thank you.  I love it.  Yeah, sure.  Beautiful.  Oh, I love it.  That's why I've just been keeping busy making a bunch of new stuff.  Are you taking back my pickled punk, please?  Yeah, that is pretty much.  Okay, yeah.  You know, well, we love having you on and stuff.  And obviously, you're here for the duration, I guess.  But there is some business we must tend to miss.  Yes.  You had given Opie a pickled punk a couple of years back.  Genuine carnival pickled punk.  Yeah.  How old was that thing?  We were trying to figure it out. 
[02:17:30]  We were trying to, probably from the, like, 50s or 60s.  It came out of Captain Harvey Boswell's Palace of Wonders.  What happened to Captain Harvey?  Captain Harvey recently, when I probably died about three or four years ago.  Yeah.  And I obtained his collection.  You obtained the collection.  Yes.  And then Opie was fascinated with these things.  Did he live a good life?  And was he old and stuff, hopefully?  He was old and cranky.  All right, good.  Yeah.  You know, just old carny.  And I got lucky and ended up getting the bulk of his collection. 
[02:18:00]  Mm-hmm.  Well, Opie got this pickled punk.  And I don't know.  It's just, it's a bad vibe around it.  This thing has this negative vibe.  We really don't like it.  Yeah, where is it?  It's scary.  Please.  And we figured the only...  I'm not touching it.  The only way...  I already gave up on it.  The only way we can cleanse ourselves of this is to just give it back to the person who it came from.  I'll drop it. 
[02:18:30]  Don't unwrap it.  Oh, let me see the little fella.  Oh.  Is it like you're meeting, you're seeing somebody after a long time?  An old friend?  Oh, it's just a baby.  Oh, this thing.  Oh, look at that.  The hot chicks love the pickled punk.  I forgot how good that one was.  It's a really nice one.  With the missing foot, too.  There's a missing foot?  I think one of the feeder is missing.  Oh.  Perhaps he's a novelist that went driving around. 
[02:19:00]  Like a contortionist in that little jar.  Here, Andy.  Feetless, feetless.  Feetless.  I'm officially handing it back.  Here it is.  And Katie takes it.  Uh-oh.  I think...  No, no.  Give it back to Opie.  You have to hand it directly to...  What are you doing, Opie?  I believe...  I'm with Anthony.  Do you have to hand it directly back to Andy?  First, you've got to take a sip out of there.  Shots.  Here you go, Andy.  There it is.  That's the transfer.  There it is. 
[02:19:30]  With no ritual or any of that crap.  You've turned.  People suggested.  The pickled punk is now back where it belongs.  He will rejoin his friends at Andy's.  Yes, he will be with all of his other pickled...  God, that's a good one.  Brothers and sisters.  That's a great one.  Yeah.  I've got to tell you.  The jar has been opened, and someone did tap the top of his head.  I did hear that, and whoever did that, that's amazing.  That is amazing.  Amazingly sick lunatic.  Look at that.  That's awesome.  I'm fascinated by these things. 
[02:20:00]  You're digging it.  See?  Now it's appreciated.  Now it feels appreciated again.  I sleep around like 30 of these things.  I know.  Yeah.  I saw your place, man.  But the big ones.  The display, and the lights, and the fish tanks, and the diapers.  It's all amazing, Andy.  I've got to tell you.  Next time you guys are in town in D.C., I mean, D.C. sucks, but whenever you're back there,  you guys got to come by.  You guys really have to go by.  I would like to see it.  You've got to go by his apartment.  It'll be the whole show the next morning.  There's so much going on in his apartment.  Well, that's good.  There's a lot more.  You guys can tell me how it was.  You've got to go, Anthony. 
[02:20:30]  Come on, Anthony.  I want to come over.  You wouldn't go at all?  No.  I don't think so.  The Siamese twins in a fish tank with diapers on them?  Tell me about it.  With the cleft lip?  The cleft lip.  Lion boy.  You get to see Lion boy.  Waterhead seal boy.  Seal boy.  Waterhead seal boy, huh?  Yeah.  It has a worm body with little flippers and an alien head, and it was autopsied on the  back of his head with these big Frankenstein stitches.  I mean, it looks like an alien.  Wow.  It's in this old medical jar with old locks and stuff. 
[02:21:00]  With old locks that the carnies would lock it down so nobody would steal it.  Yeah.  And chains.  It's just vintage, and it's pure carnival stuff.  It's wonderful.  Yeah.  And this guy, man, he knows how to do it right.  He's got the whole display of Pickle Punks.  It starts off all nice and normal, and then the grand finale, and he has like, what, like  drapes or whatever on each tank?  Yeah.  Some kind of thing.  Yeah.  That covers up, and then he does the big reveal, and here's this one.  You're like, ooh.  And by the end, you're just horrified. 
[02:21:30]  They get just scarier and scarier.  And he has the lights coming up from the bottom of some of the tanks.  Good presentation.  Oh, yeah, so the lights are reflecting all over the place, making it look even creepier.  Hey, you guys have fun.  You can tell me about it.  You should come.  I'll snap you.  You know, snap some pictures.  No?  I'll take a look-see.  Don't you have another Pickled Punk here today?  Yeah.  Well, I brought one to give you.  No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.  This one.  Oh, my God.  This one was made.  Is that, I hope that's in a jar of honey, man. 
[02:22:00]  This is what's known, well, it's not a, a bouncer is a Pickled Punk that's made of rubber.  That's what a lot of the older carnivals, the carnivals, because they couldn't get the real ones,  so they could just make casts off the real ones.  So this is, it's not a bouncer, it's a pseudo-bouncer.  It's made of resin.  It was made by a friend of mine who used to work for a very famous toy company who just quit.  Oh, so that is not real.  No, this is not real, and I'll eventually be there in, like, beginning of production right now. 
[02:22:30]  We just, I just have to get better jars for them and make a banner line.  What was used as a mold?  It was just sculpted.  It was sculpted from photographs, yeah.  The Peterson boy.  Looks like Rosie O'Donnell from The Leg.  Yeah, nice.  So, if she can deal with this one.  Well, I don't know.  Oh, is that going to get you?  Let me see.  Let me see.  No, if it's fake, even I'm fine with that.  Oh, yeah, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's resin. 
[02:23:00]  As long as it's fake, we don't open it.  What if he's just saying it's fake?  You can't, yeah, you can't open it.  What is it in?  What kind of liquid?  I just think it's in, what did he put?  I think he put in some kind of pickle juice and water, but he didn't use distilled water,  so it smells really bad, and it, let me take a look, see.  All right.  I mean, if you shake it, you can hear clunk.  Yeah, it's heavy.  Yeah, you can tell it's, it's not real.  How can you tell? 
[02:23:30]  Because it's, it looks like it's, uh, mottled.  You're not tricking us, are you, Andy?  No, no, I wouldn't do that.  All right.  It looks sculpted.  You can tell.  Does it?  Yeah.  Let me take a look.  Take a look.  I don't want to touch the jar.  I don't want to touch the jar, either.  No, I mean, I...  Oh, Jesus Christ, oh, he rolls the jar.  Look, you can tell.  Yeah, you can tell.  I mean, if you just, if you just compare the two.  Turn it around, you can tell.  That's fetus ass, isn't, uh...  And I've seen my share of fetus ass, and... 
[02:24:00]  That's some hot fetus ass.  That ain't it.  Well, what we'll do is we'll, uh...  Yeah, we'll keep that one.  Yeah, you can deal with that one, you know.  It's like having an action figure around.  Yeah, that's all it is, I figure.  That's fine.  All right, and Andy Gore's in studio.  Anything else you got, Andy?  Oh, yeah, I got a few other things.  Just gave Norton some shirts, some, uh...  Fantastic shirts, by the way.  It says, my daddy touches me, and in parentheses, but don't tell mommy.  And it's in a beautiful Walt Disney type thing.  Oh, let me see.  Look at that.  Yeah, it is.  It's like that Walt Disney fun. 
[02:24:30]  And then I also gave him a youth size, you know, just in case.  Just put one on the little kids.  Little fellas.  They're cute shirts and all, but do people actually walk around wearing them, you think?  You've seen them?  I'd walk around wearing them.  Yeah.  I'd like to see that.  Oh, my God.  Make sure she, you know, puts the shirt on.  We'll get a picture of that from foundrymusic.com and opiatemusic.com.  Would you?  I have one of the most offensive shirts ever on my desk.  I can't even say it.  I can't even bring it home or nothing.  What's it say?  Someone sent it in? 
[02:25:00]  Could you go grab it?  Go grab it, Hawk.  It's, uh...  Yeah, someone sent it to me.  I think it's from T-Shirt Hell.  Yeah, they put out T-shirts.  You ever see that site?  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah.  And, uh, there it is.  They shouldn't get T-Shirt Hell.  Wow.  That is a classic.  That is a classic.  Yeah.  It's a picture of Adolf Hitler.  Look, you're a reporter now, man.  I know.  I'm just commenting what...  This is what someone sent us.  It's a T-Shirt, a picture of Adolf Hitler. 
[02:25:30]  And in big letters, it says,  Love him or hate him, Hitler killed a ton of Jews.  Who would walk around with that?  Who actually would walk around wearing that shirt?  I got it in the mail here at the studio.  It has not left the studio.  I don't even want to throw it away,  because if the garbage...  If someone goes through the garbage and sees that...  Yeah, I'm going to have to burn it.  I made one Hitler shirt in my day.  Uh, it was Hitler, like a picture of him,  and he had a milk mustache,  and it said, 
[02:26:00]  Habin Milch at the bottom,  but she's got milk.  Of course.  And I just thought it was hilarious.  Well, it just causes too much of an uproar.  Go figure.  Go figure.  Just poking a little...  That's the whole Hitler thing.  Just poking a little fun, you know?  Strikes a nerve.  Yeah, when you wipe out half of Europe,  you know, they tend to get sensitive.  Yeah.  A little touchy.  It's a little parody, you know?  The O.P. and Anthony Program.  Pish, pew, pew, pew, pew, pew, pew.  Or that stupid XM stinger they do.  T-D-P-E.  What is it?

[02:29:00]  I was trying.  I don't think it really worked.  But fat people are not diseased.  Yeah, that was the subject of this bit.  Fat activists are upset with fat actress.  With Rich Voss in studio,  the guy's comment on fatties and eating disorders  get compared to drug addiction and alcoholism.  Just whenever Voss tries to sound smart,  there's always a problem.  Yeah.  His little stiff claymation hands go straight.  Let me tell you something.  What?  What?  What?  It's always like,  it's always some childlike observation. 
[02:29:30]  Childlike.  It really is.  It's all his mind can really wrap around.  You know, really,  if you drink too much.  Wow.  Oh, that's cute.  You want to just hold his hand.  Little hand.  Little rotten gargoyle fingers.  Those fingers look good over a library entrance.  Awful hands.  Non-bending.  Say, Jim, nice meals.  The worst of Opie and Anthony.  There's some sexual reference.  Kirstie Alley, fat actress.  What do you guys think? 
[02:30:00]  Yes, she is.  She is.  The show is just awful.  It's absolutely awful.  It's getting horrible reviews.  The acting stinks.  They're kind of doing like a curb your enthusiasm thing,  which is so stupid to try to even copy that format.  Yeah.  But you're going to see a bunch of these shows come out now,  just like curb your enthusiasm.  Of course.  One good concept, 50 rip-offs.  So here it is.  Kirstie Alley is poking fun at her own weight problems  in the new series, Fat Actress.  We all know that.  But members of the National Eating Disorders Association  are biting mad at the show. 
[02:30:30]  She's fat, making fat jokes.  End of story.  But there's a group out there pissed off  that Kirstie Alley, who's fat,  is making fun of her fatness  because she has a sense of humor.  Why can't these people organize?  If they're going to have an organization,  why don't you organize and go to a gym?  Why don't you all get together?  Oh, it's never that.  Let's meet at five  and get on a treadmill for a few minutes.  Wait to hear these clips.  Wait to hear these clips.  The head of the Seattle-based organization  isn't seeing the humor in Alley's show  and believes it might even be harmful  to people with eating disorders. 
[02:31:00]  The character appears to be suffering  from a binge eating disorder, said Lynn,  CEO of the association.  That's not funny.  She's eating a cigarette  so she can clear her stomach.  It's appalling.  I'm meeting people  who lost their children  to eating disorders.  There's nothing funny  about eating disorders.  There's just no punchline.  What does CEO mean?  The current elephant on duty?  Fat cunt.  Shut your mouth.  I don't know why I said that. 
[02:31:30]  Warning.  Warning.  All C-Word alert.  C-Word alert.  Warning.  Warning.  Warning.  I don't drop the C-bomb very often.  In the series which premiered Monday,  well, I think this is an older article,  Alley is seen gorging herself,  overdosing on laxatives,  and sticking a feather down her throat  so that she could purge  without ruining her manicure.  There you go.  The association has gotten...  Jimmy, where are you going?  To throw up.  Oh.  Where's he going?  This is perfect for him. 
[02:32:00]  The association has gotten calls and emails  complaining about the show.  What's wrong?  I just said,  why don't we get one of these...  We have an article like this.  We should get...  I said,  let's try to get one of these people on the phone.  Oh, that would be nice.  It would be nice.  But why not?  You know,  if we're going to do an article on the...  get the spokespeople,  I'm going to want to come on  and give their point  if you want a radio show.  They probably would.  All right.  Especially if set up  like we were sympathetic to their cause.  The Greg and Anthony show,  yes.  The Tony and Greg show.  The CEO, Lynn,  was very pissed off  with the feather seed.  I guess,  Kirstie Alley...  Well, 
[02:32:30]  they stick it down her throat.  You should not make light of bulimia  and that sort of thing,  the purging and binging opiates.  It's a harmful disease.  You know,  but why can you make fun of alcoholism  and drug addiction  and skinny people  but fat people  are out of the collection?  That's right.  I used to live with an anorexic.  She took 80...  No, 60 laxatives a day.  I'm not lying.  She shicked her bed one night  when I was sleeping.  Hot.  Dude,  I went out with a girl  for...  Are you binging 
[02:33:00]  and purging over there,  Opie?  What are you doing?  When I was in college,  I went out with her  for like a second, man.  This girl was  knocked down gorgeous.  We called her...  Well,  I can't say her name.  I shouldn't say her name.  That's right.  But we would go to Red Lobster  for a really nice meal  and she was real thin  and she would just...  Red Lobster  for a nice meal?  Dude,  I was eating right.  Did you put your gold teeth in?  I was 20 years old.  You had a homeboy's  go for a nice meal.  Yeah, I know. 
[02:33:30]  What's the matter?  You couldn't get a reservation  at the Sizzler?  You guys are delusional.  All the sangria.  You guys have changed, man.  Right.  You don't think  there's listeners out there  thinking that Red Lobster  would be a good meal for them?  Yeah, they work 10 hours a day,  six days a week.  Right.  Well, that's what I'm saying.  I was 20 years old.  I used to go to the one  on Jericho Turnpike  all the time.  Dude,  I sold my...  All the time.  I sold my books in college  to get, you know,  spending money to drink  and go to Red Lobster.  And then to go to a Red Lobster  thinking I was going to get laid 
[02:34:00]  at the end of it.  Are you kidding me?  Things are different now.  Back in the day,  Red Lobster was a...  You know,  that's a good date.  Yeah, right.  Nice dessert  at Basket Robbins after it.  Yeah.  Now it's the Olive Garden.  It's a hot place  to take a meal.  You guys are just not in touch  with the common man anymore.  Dude, we certainly are.  I completely...  I used to go  to the Red Lobster  all the time.  He has 24 hours  to pack for his 10-day cruise.  He has...  He has...  He got the best room available  and he's pissed off  that he didn't get the one  with the grand piano.  He's got like a two-level suite. 
[02:34:30]  And that's his big complaint today,  that he's got 24 hours  to pack for this  unbelievable vacation  that he's been looking forward to  for two years.  And I'm trying to share  a cute story  when I was very poor.  The Red Lobster.  And I appreciated  the Red Lobster meal  when it happened  and today I still appreciate it.  Oh!  There you go.  Today you would never go...  No.  Yo, give me some  more of them shrimp.  That's what you get there. 
[02:35:00]  Some catfish.  To make a long story short,  no great ending to the story,  but, you know,  she would just stuff herself  at the...  Well, this one particular  all the time.  It happened a few times,  but this was the one  when I knew.  Yeah.  And she went to the bathroom.  She was gone for 15 minutes  after we gorged ourselves  and came back  and you just could tell  that she was just  puking it all up in the bathroom.  I would punch her  in her fucking face.  You could tell...  I could tell in her eye.  Her eye...  I mean, you just could tell.  And I'm like,  what am I getting myself into?  You just watch them 
[02:35:30]  push the food  around the plate, Dan.  They don't eat it.  They just...  You could tell  when you kissed her  and tasted scallops and bile.  Well, the back of their teeth  are always rotting out.  Yeah, yeah.  The stomach acid  that's coming up.  Their esophaguses  are all messed up.  But they're nice bodies  on the top.  And they're always hot.  They should look good.  Those titties look really great  until they go a little too far.  So I encourage you  to continue puking  for a little while.  Sure.  Did I ever tell you  that I lost a chick  to John Stamos, too?  Did you?  Really? 
[02:36:00]  That's not bad.  Yeah, I lost a chick  to John Stamos.  I was going out  with this...  She was gorgeous, man.  Do you think  he took her to Red Lobster?  Well, what happened  was I was doing radio  in Rochester  going out with...  I mean, she was in  a couple magazines,  let's just put it that way.  She won some competitions.  Yeah.  But she was a coke whore.  Well, I don't know  the whore part.  Well, I got something.  But I didn't have  to do the coke thing.  What's the but?  Where's the problem?  So, I think I found 
[02:36:30]  my dream woman,  except for the little  problems she had.  Yeah.  But she was like a 10,  so I was like,  ah, you don't notice things.  You look past stuff  like coke addiction.  So then she comes down  to New York for,  I don't know,  I'm trying to remember,  like a vacation or something.  Yeah.  Ends up hooking up  with John Stamos  before he was famous.  Oh.  Lost a chick  to John Stamos.  Before famous  John Stamos?  When he was Blackie  in the soap operas?  On the general hospital.  Yeah.  Still a handsome guy,  though.  Used to watch that show 
[02:37:00]  years ago.  Sure.  Anyway, getting back  to this.  Gave me red lobster money.  Getting back to this.  Some of that red lobster money.  And yes,  her pictures are  out there somewhere.  Yeah.  Good luck finding it.  Anyway,  so Lynn,  the CEO of this  organization,  Anthony,  she's pissed off  about the feather scene  where Kirstie Alley  shoves it down  her throat to puke.  They're offering advice  about purging  without ruining  your manicure,  said Lynn. 
[02:37:30]  When I saw that,  I thought,  oh no,  I promise you  somebody will try that  because people  with eating disorders  are not thinking clearly.  Apparently not.  Wow.  They can't stop  shoving food  in their fucking fat faces.  They're not thinking clearly.  So then,  we got some audio  of these organizations  bitching about the show.  Listen to this one.  The show is insulting  to fat people everywhere.  I would hope  that people would be  outraged by this.  This is promoting  hatred.  It's promoting  self-hatred  and hatred of people 
[02:38:00]  that are fat  all over the place.  Yes.  Yeah.  And?  Yeah.  Point is,  what promotes  hatred of fat people  is a cross-country  flight next to one of you.  That is what  promotes hatred  of fat people.  Yeah.  You slovenly gorillas.  You know,  people have to understand,  if you're fat,  you're going to be  made fun of.  Yes.  It's just the way it is.  That's,  that's life. 
[02:38:30]  You're going to be  made fun of  because you're fat.  And don't try to  pawn it off  like she does  as a disease.  Unless your thyroid  is,  is,  melting down,  it's not a disease.  There are some people,  honestly,  but it's such a small  percentage of people  that are overweight  because of some  real medical problem.  The disease angle  is the same as  alcoholism or drug addiction.  Right.  In that,  it is this mania,  this obsession. 
[02:39:00]  However,  being an alcoholic  and an addict,  I understand the disease  and there has to come  a point where you go,  you know what,  I'm going to do something  for myself,  you are still  consciously making  the decision  to do nothing  for yourself.  Right.  So while it is,  there is a sickness  element to it  that is an obsession  that is beyond  rational thinking,  you're still making  the decision  to not help yourself  or to try.  I don't buy  the word disease.  They should,  you know something,  it is something.  Right.  I'll say it's something.  So give it another word.  But to call it a disease 
[02:39:30]  is an insult  to somebody  that has diseases  that they can't  just cure by themselves.  Yeah,  if you're like  getting radiation  shot into your face  to get rid of a disease,  that's a disease.  If you could just  put a Twinkie down  and you're cured,  that ain't a fucking disease.  If you could put  the booze bottle down  and you're cured.  Wow,  you're talking  to two addicts.  I saw them  look at each other  like,  I saw them  look at each other  like,  wow,  you're going to speak up  or am I going to speak up?  Call it an affliction,  call it something else 
[02:40:00]  than a disease.  My only disagreement  is that you're cured  once you put the bottle down  because you're the same  person underneath.  But,  all that said,  there still has to be  a decision you make  as an individual  to not engage  in that behavior.  No one ever poured  booze down my throat.  No one ever put  drugs in Vos.  Right.  You make that decision  And you know  when you're doing it  that it's not a good thing  that you're doing  and you should stop.  But there's diseases  you can cure  but you can't cure  alcoholism or addiction.  You're always going to be  an alcoholic or an addict 
[02:40:30]  and you're always going to  you can arrest the disease.  You're using the word  cure though.  I don't think that word  should be used either.  It's not like that.  It's something different  than a disease.  Alcoholism,  drug addiction,  I don't see it  as a disease.  Well see,  fat people too,  they compare it to  alcoholism or addiction.  Like addiction,  like I've given  hand jobs  for the addiction.  Fat people do it  for the desperation.  They don't do it  because they're addicted.  You know what I mean?  There's a difference.  I just don't see it 
[02:41:00]  as a disease.  Something like you say  there's no cure for it  because you're always  going to have that  in your head.  But that's why  I don't see it  as a disease.  I see it as some type of  I don't know,  maybe you could call it  a mental disorder.  Okay.  Something like that.  There is a physical aspect  to it.  Like the American  Medical Association  I believe is...  I don't know  if they've officially  called it a disease.  Alcoholism they have.  Okay.  Simply because  there is a physical thing  where if you stop drinking  and I know guys  this happens  when I was in rehab  with one of them  and you stop drinking 
[02:41:30]  for 15 to 20 years  your progression  acts as if you never stopped.  You don't pick up  where you left off.  You pick up  as if your body  had never stopped.  So there is some type  of a physical  thing there  which may all go back  to dopamine  in the brain.  I really don't know  what it is.  The semantics  of is it disease  it doesn't matter  it is something.  I don't know  you know what it is though  you can't make  a conscious decision  in your head  to not get a tumor.  Right.  You know what I mean?  You can make  a conscious decision  in your head  to not pick up a drink  or not pick up a food.  Some people can't  make a conscious decision.  No, no. 
[02:42:00]  Everyone can.  I don't want to hear  the bullshit.  I'm an addict  and it's so hard  I can't  I gotta  you're making  a conscious decision  maybe there's  a few people  I'll even give it  a physical decision  at some point.  I never want to  you know  cover everybody  I'm sure there are  people that are  addict addicts  in their life  but I gotta say  most know  that when they are  putting something  in their body  like drugs or alcohol  that they are doing  something bad  they shouldn't do it  it's making their life  and their body worse 
[02:42:30]  and if they just  didn't do it  they wouldn't be doing it.  It's that simple.  It is and it isn't.  I agree with you  about the decision  you are making a decision  whenever you pick up  I mean the bottom line  is this  addicted or not  you still know  that there's  self-help groups  out there  there's rehabs  there's hospitals  there's detoxes  no one in modern society  doesn't know that  you are making  that conscious decision  like Lady Di  she's an alcoholic  but you know what  she's making the decision  to not help herself  but there is something  that happens  once you pick it up  that is just  it is beyond 
[02:43:00]  they say obsession  it's like an obsession  that like rational thought  has no power over it  it's like  I'm not a victim  but when I'm home  on a computer  believe you  you think I don't know  that I shouldn't be  jacking you off  for eight hours  rationally  I'm a smart guy  I know that  and I get into this zone  and I'm like  oh hi  who is that hurting  that is such a thing  no no no  but you don't understand  that same mental obsession  which is no one's fault  I don't blame anyone  I don't blame other people  for my sickness  but it is there  you're like a monkey  but fat people 
[02:43:30]  I really am like a chimp  fat people are rewarded  in this country  for losing weight  they're rewarded  oh look he lost  you know what I mean  like what about  when you were gaining  the weight  and just throwing  all that garbage  down your mouth  TV shows are giving  them prizes  to lose weight  some of these fat people  they actually  they start making  themselves believe  they don't want  to lose weight  and they don't want  to be  they stand there  and say  no I'm proud  of who I am  and I walk around  if you don't like it 
[02:44:00]  but you know  deep down  they look at people  who aren't fat  and want  to live  life  not as an eyesore  walking around  they want to be  everyone has  the want  to be normal  you know  where you're not  looked at  like some kind  of freak  well don't you think  you're also born  with a body type  too  to a point  I can't  get as big  as Ralphie May  if I ate  between now  and the time I died  really  you're thinking  you could get  as fat as Ralphie May 
[02:44:30]  I think there is  something to do  with his body type  but I think  if you had  some massive  calorie diet  and didn't do  exercise  anyone I think  could get that fat  if you just lay  on a couch  up to the size  of Ralphie May  I think you're  born with a body type  and then it's up  to you to figure  out what you're  going to do  within that body type  you're cross to bear  then  if it means  you can't have  cake  and you have  to eat  maybe vegetables  then that's  what you have  to do  everyone has  the shit 
[02:45:00]  you're fed  in life  you know  the shit  you gotta just  suck down  and eat  because that's  your lot  that's the hand  you were dealt  if I could find  another cliche  let me know  but that's  what you gotta  deal with  you can make  the choice  to take  that hardship  and deal  with it  or  you can  shove  the cake  and cookies  and crap  down your mouth  into your fat  slaw  and the fact  is we all  had problems  growing up  I'm so sick  of hearing  that  everyone has  their shit  everyone had  a tough time  growing up  it's child abuse  because kids  are force fed 
[02:45:30]  that food  when they're  little kids  that's child abuse  when you're feeding  a kid that much  and that bad  a lot of times  you see a fat kid  you see a fat parent  that's feeding  them the same crap  the best was  the Snapple lady  talking about  the reason she is  overweight and fat  in her adult life  is because  her parents  when she was three  decided to have  another kid  oh yeah  that got her  so troubled  so troubled  that she had to  get fat  that's her excuse  why she's a fat pig  now  self hatred  whatever causes it 
[02:46:00]  is what most  of this stuff  is based on  you're running  away from something  I have empathy  for food addicts  because as an  alcoholic  as a drug addict  I can't touch it  I'm fucking ruined  if I touch it  but food  if you're that  addicted to food  it's really hard  because you have to  eat to survive  you have to eat  a little bit of it  food is a really  tough one  as much as fat  groups make me  nauseous  there is something  to be said  for the fact  that if I had to  do a line of coke  every day  and that's all  I could do  I would be  a fucking maniac  so I mean  there is somebody  jerking around  the studio  sweating 
[02:46:30]  hair all a mess  gossiping pointlessly  opening windows  in five degree weather  while I drop a log  the size of a Haitian family  most anorexic  or eating disorders  come from  dysfunctional  alcoholic families  where they're trying  to take control  as kids  because they're  not getting that  attention  I feel like a doctor  and they do it  with food  you certainly don't  sound like one  they do it  with food  let's play another  clip from this  fat group  we need to talk  about the imagery  of women in Hollywood 
[02:47:00]  why it is so easy  and okay for us  to laugh at a large  sized person  why aren't we  seeing more diversity  and to know  that bulimia  and anorexia  and compulsive  eating are serious  diseases  we're not seeing  diversity in Hollywood  because no one  wants to watch  that crap  by the way  right  um  Carlin has the  best bit on  anorexia  he did it  at live  at live aid  don't you call it  comic relief  cause there are  all these  just you know  oh yeah  Carlin comes out  and he goes 
[02:47:30]  what do you say  anorexia  what a disease  rich cunts  don't want to eat  fuck them  it could be the  most brutal moment  in comedy  I've ever seen  he's just  his bit on bulimia  he has a whole bit  on his genius  I'm sure a lot  of you have heard it  do you think  there's you know  and this point's  been brought up  plenty of times  I'm not breaking  any new ground  here but  in impoverished  nations  you don't find  anorexics  or people with  bulimia  you don't find it  where's that disease  is there a cure 
[02:48:00]  over there  that we don't know  about  well Anthony  they have a  low fat diet  oh is that it  don't forget  you don't find  a lot of coke  addiction either  in tribes  cause most of them  but the sickness  see it's not  about the substance  like alcohol  food addiction  drug addiction  it's all the same  thing  that's all  the symptoms  the problem  whatever makes you  that  do you understand  that addict  that I'm sure  they have in those  so in some tribe  in Africa  it's an addiction  to cutting off  women's clits  yeah absolutely  and using them  as jaspers  here one more clip 
[02:48:30]  laughing because  you know  oh haha  it's a fat person  isn't that so funny  diminishes people  we're not in our cars  eating all the time  and we're not  talking about  how fat we are  all the time  we're strong  empowered  loving  alive  human beings  you're not  empowered  you're not  strong  you're weak  you're loving  and alive  but you're not  strong and empowered  you're absolutely  right  stop it  you have to admit  that's the way  you start to fight 
[02:49:00]  addiction  you have to admit  that you're finished  and it kicked the  shit out of you  yeah  there you go  it won  I can't  bow to it  I can't do it  won and I'm  finished  it smashes my  fat face  every time  kicks your ass  every time  let's go to  Carrie in Vegas  wonderful booze  wonderful  strong booze  hi Angel  hey Carrie  hey there  squishy tits  how are you  I'm good  thank you  I'm eating  some yogurt  I'm a bit  you know  being fat 
[02:49:30]  is a disease  yeah  how much do you weigh  Carrie  how much do you weigh  no no  can I  it's a muscular disease  because I have it  my arm muscles  keep putting  fucking Big Macs  in my mouth  there you go  very funny  you need to stop  putting the fucking Big Macs  in your mouth  you'll lose weight  it's a simple thing  and you know  I hate to  beat a dead horse  but I can barely hear you guys  are you guys doing  are you guys doing a gag toss  or is this real  I called in 
[02:50:00]  remember I called in  from the cell phone  in the day  just to hear it myself  George what's up  I hate to eat a dead horse  good morning  go ahead George  Norton and Voss  you guys should be  jumping up and down  I mean you guys  know better than this  Anthony you are  so damn wrong  it's frightening  it must be nice  to live a life  where you don't  understand addiction  but for the rest of us  that are addicts  whether it's food  or drugs  it's something we have  to live with every day  I just don't  I'm not saying  it's not  it's nothing 
[02:50:30]  I'm not saying  it's anything less  than you're saying it is  it absolutely is  I'd be stupid  to say it's not  what I'm saying is  it is not a disease  it's not a disease  just like schizophrenia  you don't get  you know  just because it's not a tumor  doesn't make it a disease  but dude what do you mean  we should be jumping up and down  we are explaining  I'm explaining my point of view  my mania for alcohol  I'm not a doctor  I don't know the medical things  that go into it  I just know what happens to me  I don't understand  I got 13 years of sobriety  Timmy you probably got a bunch  I got 18 years 
[02:51:00]  you know the drill  absolutely  but I also understand  what I'm trying to explain  it's hard to explain  that the underlying sickness  that the problem  whether it's booze  or drugs  or food  or gambling  it is all the same  they're all like  subheadings  under the same illness  they're a symptom of you  it's absolutely impossible  to explain to somebody  who does not  look  no  you've explained it  fine  I can understand it  believe me sir  I understand  and I agree  I think it's an insult  to people  with diseases  to call it a disease 
[02:51:30]  it isn't  but why can't you call it a disease  it's a semantics argument  it is a semantics argument  Anthony doesn't feel it's a disease  I know medically  it has been classified  but to me  it doesn't matter either way  that's irrelevant  as to what they call it  you understand what I mean  I don't care  some people want to accept  that it is  accept that it's okay  to me either way  I don't care  I just know I have it  and I know what it does to me  the reason it's called it  for some reason too  is also for insurance reasons  and for rehabs and stuff  I'm not saying you're wrong  about that  but I'm just  I think eating is probably 
[02:52:00]  harder to change your behavior  than drugs or alcohol  I agree  if you go through a day  without drugs or alcohol  you have to eat  that's what I'm saying before  and being able to change that  Jimmy you know  don't take a drink  don't take a drug  I know that  but I can't not eat  during the day  well I was just saying that  a couple minutes ago  I mean I do have empathy  for people  but as you know  as an addict as well  there is a decision  we have to make  to go look  like when I quit smoking  I quit off  I think what happened  in the opening  I had the moment of clarity  and I stopped  and I was going to finish the pack  and Anthony actually said to me 
[02:52:30]  just put the fucking things down  and dude  it was such disgust  in his voice  well I said  I'm going to have  one more cigarette  which normally doesn't work  with an addiction  but I had one more cigarette  I went down to the cellar  I made the decision  SD helped me  she took me  got the patch  I did the patch program  the way it was suggested  that I do it  I had the willingness to quit  so you know what I mean  we have to make that decision  but also too  you say you have to eat  but also you can eat right  there's a difference  between eating healthy  and eating you know  bundt cakes all day long 
[02:53:00]  that's the argument  you should be able  to drink right  no no no no  no no  that's not the same argument  because I know  I'm with Voss  because I see these people  in the supermarkets  like okay  you're fat  you need to eat  you have some kind of  fucking chemical imbalance  whatever you want to call it  an addiction  but why are you  you know  filling up your cart  with enemas  I've seen  but at the end of the day  guys  it's an addiction  and Jimmy  you're right  you're right  but hello  what did you say  did you say what  you end up  you and I  you know  we all know 
[02:53:30]  that  I mean  I suffer from the same  kind of addiction  Jimmy  that you do  sitting in front of a computer  oh yeah yeah  absolutely  you replace one  with another  substitution  one of the biggest problems  is you can't really  you know  trying to change  addictive behavior  it takes a lifetime  no but wait a second  didn't you say  but you still have to eat  on a daily basis  if you're a food addict  right  obviously you have to eat  I don't have to drink  every day  but  if I have to eat  I'm going to make a choice  do I want to lose weight  and eat right  or am I going to take  you know  ten Oreo cookies  and put peanut butter on them 
[02:54:00]  and then something else  if you're going to have to eat  you might as well eat right  and that's how you're going to lose weight  yeah there's willpower man  you know  to a point  I mean when you're making  conscious decisions  to eat nothing but junk  and Big Macs  and all that  and then  and then hide behind the excuse  that you're addicted to food  that's ridiculous  you know I can't have a drink  I can't have a drug  if I have one  I'm done  but now George brought up the point  before about  you have to eat food  you don't have to do drugs  he said if you have one drink  you know it's over  but if you eat food 
[02:54:30]  you have to eat every day  Jimmy  you take cold medicine  right  not with alcohol  no I know  but you do take cold medicine  yes  which is  like ComTrack or something  like a pill  yeah and somebody  who's a drug addict  they can take some  over the counter drugs  because they're reasonable people  that know what  limitations there are  what I'm saying is  it's the same thing  with food  you can look at the food  and say  I can take  a healthy type of food  I don't have to binge  because I'm an addict  you know 
[02:55:00]  if you're a drug addict  you can still take  some over the counter drugs  and not go into  this full blown relapse  well if you melt it down  and shoot it  then that's a problem  right  you're right  you're right  you're right  medication and stuff like that  I mean that's a very  individual thing  and it's like  that's a real tough  decision sometimes  like when you gotta take  very rarely will I  ever take a narcotic  unless I have absolute pain  like if they provide  and I'll always take  less than I have to  it's all motives  it's all like  what are my motives  am I doing this  and you can only lie to yourself  you want to lie to yourself  go ahead  but if I'm taking something 
[02:55:30]  because I'm genuinely sick  and I'm genuinely in pain  then I can't mess with  alcohol cough medicine  I can't do it  I've done it  I can't do it  if they say  you know  the doctor says  one every four hours  and you're taking  seven every four hours  then you're  you know  you made a conscious decision  to relapse  that's basically  well I see it as some kind  of mental disorder  or affliction  that's not wrong dude  you're not right  I don't see it as  this physical disease  it's both  there is a physical  combination too though  alright let's go to  Scott in Jersey  Scott  yeah how you doing guys  hey listen  I'm all over what  Anthony's got to say  it's just bullshit 
[02:56:00]  you've got to make a decision  a disease or an addiction  you know  and like Anthony says  you can't tell somebody  that's got cancer  that I'm packed  because I got a disease  it's just bullshit  yeah  I'm not saying even you're wrong  but there are different  kinds of diseases  like you have to understand  if there's no physical thing  why do people die  going through alcohol withdrawals  I mean  why do people shake  until they have a first drink  there is a physical element  to this sickness  it's not just a bunch of  dumbbells who can't say no  I'm saying there's a physical  there's something physical to it 
[02:56:30]  but it's the alcohol  it's the drug  it's not  it's not some enzyme  you're  you know  it's not something  your body is creating  on it's own  it's the alcohol  and the drugs you put in it  and the body's reaction  to it  detoxing itself  it's  it's what you put in it  that's screwing it up  that's making the shakes  that's  that's what  we're making the shakes  but what actually causes  the mania for the alcohol  the mania  all this stuff  goes way beyond the actual substance  and they're actually starting to look  I don't know what it is 
[02:57:00]  that makes you  physiologically  we don't know that yet  we know tumors  cancer  but look at all the things  we don't know about cancer  why do you get it if you don't smoke  there's a million things about cancer  we don't know  a lot of stuff about alcoholism  and drug addiction  we don't know  but they're starting to think  that it's something  a chemical release in the brain  so what if they find out  let's just play devil's advocate  and find out that it is  a physical thing that happens  that causes you to develop  this type of thing  that you  well it's  that you  it's hereditary  it can be yeah  alcoholism's hereditary  it's what  it's hereditary  I heard hereditary 
[02:57:30]  you left the H  off hereditary  it's only a letter  it's only a letter  alright  you really are an homo  it's hereditary  hey Nick Gardner  we got itch boss  in the studio today  Jesus  I thought I was dead  oh my god  hereditary  I at least try  to pronounce the letters  some mother fur  oh my lord  oh wow  it's hereditary 
[02:58:00]  alright let's go to Brandy  you're no doctor  Brandy's from Oklahoma  5'4", 180 pounds  Brandy  yes hello  hi  I can hear the fatness  through the phone  oh  she sent an email  with gravy on it  go ahead sweetie  I guess it's really good  I can't hear you  no what's that  go ahead  it's okay  I just want to say  that last caller  was such a douche  why  I agree with Anthony  completely  oh  I've had  drinking issues  and I knew to put it down  because I was on the road  to becoming 
[02:58:30]  a horrible alcoholic  uh huh  I've been fat all my life  but you know what  I know to put the damn  Twinkie down sometimes  uh huh  not if you're still fat  yeah but not all the time  do I put the Twinkie down  and not by the way  knowledge is no defense  yeah  a lot of people  I knew smoking was bad  but I continue to do it  so knowledge is nice to have  but it's not an action  do you drink every once in a while  though have a wine or something  no  not at all  nothing  nothing  I have not drank  in probably about  four to five years 
[02:59:00]  how about marijuana  nope  I am a smoker though  which makes it  even worse  it's like  I just transfer my addiction  and that's all it is  is an addiction  you know  how come the addictions  are always for great stuff  let me tell you something  smoking rocks kids  it feels good  it's cool  don't let them kid you  it does make you look cool  and it's just a fun thing to do  with your hand  while you're drinking  in a bar somewhere  it's very good  uh uh  things that make people fat 
[02:59:30]  you don't see these  these fatties  that are  my addiction  you don't see them  wailing down  huge piles of broccoli  and red bell peppers  it's always the sweet stuff  the stuff that tastes good  alcohol  drugs  that shit makes you feel great  that may all  well same with sugar too  it's that instinct  yeah  but that  that kind of comes from  what I was saying  why isn't anyone addicted  that's putting a hammer  across their face  a few times a day  oh that may be  somebody who are  well a lot of people are  a lot of people have  amputee sicknesses  they cut their own fingers off  I mean they  there's uh  you know  they cut themselves too 
[03:00:00]  yeah absolutely  cutters  yeah but  for the most part  you find a lot of  people with these addictions  are fat people  because they like to taste the cake  yeah  but once it goes beyond  and that's where you're right  that's the beauty  that's the beauty of addiction  you gotta give it to addiction  it knows what it's doing  it ropes you in with this great shit  but when you are  when you're drinking  and missing work  when you've lost your wife  when you're gambling  and you lose your house  no intelligent person says  this  you continue long after  the party was over  and that's what the addiction is  that's what the sickness is  it's like 
[03:00:30]  believe me  if I could just fucking drink  and have a good time  and oh I got silly last night  I farted and pointed at someone  and laughed  but you know  when I was drinking  and cutting myself with a razor  and going  what the fuck am I doing  and I'm still drinking  that's the mania  that's the insanity  nobody wants to drunk drive  and kill people  and yet people do it  and they continue to drink  it's insanity  it's not easy  that's what Petra was in for  good point Kimmy  yeah I mean it's like  it goes long beyond  where the party stops  alright Brandy  yeah I just wanted to say  that I have recently found  the Opie and Anthony diet  and my goal is to lose 
[03:01:00]  all the weight I can  so I can play  what's in my pants  that's right  we make you sick  thank you  the Opie and Anthony diet  I fucking love it  is you have sex with Jim Norton  and whatever he gives you  causes you to lose weight  long beyond where you want to  I love you Norton  you're back  thank you  Brandy we hear this  feather thing helps though  as far as you know  purging out all the food  that's right  yeah that's what I learned today  for all those fatties out there  looking for a new way  for a new way to lose weight 
[03:01:30]  those fatty  those people complaining  whatever that organization  how come they don't complain  about those shows  like Biggest Loser  you're still making fun  of fat people  trying to you know  it's all just a freak show  Freddie B from Philly  what happened to the phrase  bad habit  remember when it was  just a bad habit  now everyone's got groups  and organizations  and they're empowered  and they're  you used to just be  yeah that guy's got a bad habit  why don't you kick that habit  god damn good  let's go to Clay in Vegas 
[03:02:00]  Clay  nah he hung up  a bad habit  only because there are people  that when they're drug addicted enough  will suck a cock  to get the  and that goes a little beyond bad habit  nobody puts the dick  of a stranger in their mouth  to fund a bad habit  that looks like a bad habit  over there  my goodness  look at what he's doing  I'm going to kick that  you don't need drugs so bad  you're like  alright come here  alright thank you for the 20  that's a bad habit  picking your nose  is a bad habit  picking jism out of it 
[03:02:30]  here's opium anthony  when they aren't stinking  who took their shoes off  it's a little stinky in here  the worst of opium anthony  I want to play this 9-1-1 thing for Tracy  I know  I want to hear some of this  because Tracy you're a parent  do your kids fight a lot  mm-mm  they do long  no fighting  they do not whoop their ass  that's true  it's usually like this call is  the 9-1-1 call  it's this white trash 
[03:03:00]  from the south  and they  they call the cops  all the time  because of these  god damn  kids fighting  which is no reason  to call the god damn cops  is this growing up gutty  no this is  a 9-1-1 call  this woman is very angry  at the 9-1-1 operator  because he tried to make  a little joke  he tried to make  it's a great joke  it's a great joke  now if you're a 9-1-1 operator  you probably shouldn't be  making jokes at all  I think they should  because I think they hear  a lot of shit  but I gotta tell you 
[03:03:30]  I got into a little argument  with my girlfriend  last night about this  this call  I played it  and the first thing I said was  this  friggin bitch  should shut a mouth  she's trash  she should do some parenting  the whole thing is  her kids are fighting  she's got two daughters  one's 12  one's 14  they're fighting  and from the call  I assume  they're done fighting  she said they were fighting  one of them kicked a hole  in the door  and  you don't call the cops  for this  you grab them by the hair  you bang their heads together 
[03:04:00]  you do whatever you gotta do  the cops are busy  they don't need this  and the only reason  the 9-1-1 operator  made the joke  is because he's probably  heard this a thousand times  it's not serious  it's not like he was joking  that one daughter  fell on a knife  and she's bleeding  and he's making jokes  this is two white trash girls  pulling each other's hair  and this bitch  is wasting cops time  by calling  that's it  so he makes a little joke  then after the joke  this woman gets so pissed  and she is ragging severe  now she's getting  the guy's name  she's gonna report him 
[03:04:30]  this that  now the fight  is a total backseat  now it's not an emergency  to call the cops  if this was an emergency  where she should have  called the cops  and he made a joke  she would have blown off  the joke  and said  hey look  it's an emergency  I'm very pissed  at what you said  I'm gonna deal with you  but look  I got an emergency  send the cops  she completely forgets  about the emergency  that she was calling  the cops for  and now  her whole life  is getting this guy  in trouble  and the guy also  when you hear it  right after the joke  the guy realizes  in a second  you hear a second  when he realizes 
[03:05:00]  uh oh  I fucked up  and he starts  the apology wagon  but it don't work  so it's a very interesting call  yeah she's gonna cause  trouble now  you gotta hear this Tracy  let's go to this call  real fast  it's a shorty  911  what is your emergency  yes  I need a police officer  over here  what's going on  I've got two teenage daughters  and I just got home  from work  they were physically  fighting with each other  and one of them  kicked a hole  in a door  and they're 12  and almost 14 
[03:05:30]  and the 12 year old  is completely  out of control  and I can't  I physically  if she's as big as I am  I can't control her  okay did you want us  to come over  to shoot her  there it is  see that's  that's the joke  alright  that's the joke  now look  she's laughing  during the fucking call  she's saying  look  I just got home  from work  this isn't an emergency  this is not 
[03:06:00]  a reason  to call  911  911  very important  it's very important  you don't want to  cross the lines  right  call your husband  call the neighbor  knock their friggin heads  together  you don't call  911 for this  and she's laughing  I got home  from work  this isn't an emergency  so the guy  makes a joke  is she laughing  I didn't hear that  I didn't catch that  at the beginning  she goes  she's kind of like  that nervous titter  like I just  like she's almost  trying to justify this  oh absolutely  we'll play it 
[03:06:30]  from the beginning again  and let it roll  all the way through  here it is again  911 what is your emergency  yes I need a police officer  over here  what's going on  I've got two teenage daughters  and I just got home  from work  they were physically  fighting with each other  and one of them  kicked a hole in a door  and they're 12  and almost 14  and the 12 year old  is completely out of control  and I can't  physically  if she's as big as I am 
[03:07:00]  I can't control her  okay did you want us  to come over to shoot her  are you there  excuse me  that's a joke  okay  who are you  what is your name  now that's where  I hate her  that's where he realized  uh oh  I fucked up  and you hear him  trying to cover  what was the emergency  again  911  can I help you  she needs a stiff one  you're right  because now  the emergency  takes a complete backseat 
[03:07:30]  to her  and her new mission  which is getting  this guy in trouble  why did this dumbass  answer the question  he should have just  hung up the phone  which is bad  to do on a 911 call  but you know what  you gotta feed your own family  hang up the phone  stupid  he's probably feeling good  you know  he's having a good day at work  right right  let me throw this one out  he knew it wasn't an emergency  right  that's what it is  he knew because he's done this  thousands of times  he knows this call  now  also I'm not saying  the guy isn't an idiot  you're a 911 operator  it's not time to do  open mic night 
[03:08:00]  you know  you're trying out  some new material  you're trying out  some new shit  on the 911  how out of control  is she  I owe the 12 year old money  and I'm dodging  it's uh  yeah  it's probably  not a wise thing  for this guy  to test out  good point  Anthony  good point  but  that doesn't  stop  that doesn't  give her  the  a reason  to now  turn into 
[03:08:30]  a mission  this mission  she has now  to get the guy in trouble  she turned into  the Incredible Hulk  she did  all of a sudden  now emergency  it's so funny  because it was just  that moment  of silence  it's like  she's on the phone  you can just see her face  like looking at the receiver  like  oh yeah  well if we could go back  a little more  and get to the part  where  that's about it  where you realize  that same attitude  probably caused a divorce  right  and the reason why  her kids are animals  the backlash  of the divorce  the kids are  out of control 
[03:09:00]  here let's go back  to the tape  here it is  the uncomfortableness  are you there  excuse me  that's a joke  okay  who are you  what is your name  Mike Forbus  okay that's not funny  I'm sorry  I'm going to file  a formal complaint  I don't blame you a bit  because you know what  this is really not  very funny  I know it's not ma'am  I apologize  well guess what  it's not going to be  very funny  when I go in front  of your supervisor  and tell him  I understand  I guess he can  just listen to the tape  yes he can  I'm sorry 
[03:09:30]  I apologize  you know what's great  there's another call  there's other calls  coming  excuse me lady  which is probably  real 911 calls  like  help me  help me  yeah  we got a guy  some electrocuted  worker up on a line  somewhere  that's the best part  you hear the phone  ring in the background  and this guy's like  fuck that  I gotta save my job  now  and there's real trouble  on that other line  yes I'm an asshole  woman yes  I'm going to file a complaint  I don't blame you ma'am  I don't blame you  yeah sure  why would he give his name  what a dummy  he actually went by the book  here and that'll probably 
[03:10:00]  save him  that might save him  if he doesn't  you know if they don't  just blow him off  completely just for  doing what he did  if there's any chance  of being safe  the fact that he did  apologize  gave his name  here it is  and not just  you know hang up  and hide like  like one of those  prank calls gone bad  when you're a kid  it's like you know  wow  you got 10 pound balls  yeah  how do you walk  I got caller ID  your phone number  is 516  click  you hang up  wait in the corner  for your popsicle  moment  punch you  I can't believe  somebody would do 
[03:10:30]  something like that  I know  yeah  that's terrible  just listen  I think it's hilarious  to hear the phone  ring in the background  it's another call  coming in  that this guy  is supposed to answer  go ahead  Mike Forbus  okay that's not funny  I'm sorry  I'm going to file  a formal complaint  I don't blame you  a bit  because you know  what  this is really  not very funny  I know it's not  ma'am  I've told you  well guess what  it's not going to be  very funny  when I go in front of  your supervisor  and tell him  I understand  I guess he can just  listen to the tape  yes he can  I'm sorry  I apologize  hold on 
[03:11:00]  hold on  hold on  three  hold on  ma'am  yeah  okay  12 and  10 and 12  or 12 and 14  12 and 13 and a half  okay  alright  get police officers  on the way  they're on an  emergency call  right now  but as soon as  I can get one  free I'll get  them on the way  oh well don't  rush or anything  well I apologize  for my smart remark 
[03:11:30]  and I will get  them in route  as soon as I can  okay and what  is your name again  Mike Forvis  my number 605  thank you  yes ma'am  man  don't rush  or anything  yeah don't send  them away from  maybe a car wreck  or something  don't rush  send them over  here and parent  and parent for me  you're a parent  bang their heads  together  I'm with you  she's totally  frustrated man  bipolar  calling the cops  I guarantee you  she's a divorcee too 
[03:12:00]  man  oh absolutely  that dude wasn't  putting up with that  no  imagine that  husband walks home  how you doing  yeah had a hard day  at work there honey  oh hard  not as hard as me  I had to deal  with these two  oh shut up  and she probably  threatens the kid  with the cops  all the time  and never calls them  right  and they're like  yeah shut up  I'm calling  yeah they called  her bluff  well I will call  9-1-1  you know 9-1-1  somebody should just  like put a little  piece of fecal matter  on her car  I agree  two weeks straight  two weeks straight  9-1-1 
[03:12:30]  is for emergencies  9-1-1 is not a joke  there you go  thank you  can we get it  can we get it  I wish we could have  a follow up  on what happened  with this guy  because now all  these radio stations  are playing it  he's cooked  it's pretty  like recent news  he's finished  Mike Forbus  yeah poor Mike Forbus  he got like  huge like that man  I don't know  now he's  you know  we should support him  we should support him  because 9-1-1  is there for emergencies  and that does not  that is not an emergency

[03:16:00]  I'm over here at Burger King  right here in San Clemente  no not San Clemente  I'm sorry  I live in San Clemente  I'm in Laguna Niguel  I think  that's where I'm at  I'm at a drive-thru right now  I ordered my food  three times  they're mopping the floor  inside and I understand  they're busy  they're not even busy  okay  I've been to the only car here  I asked them  four different times  to make me a western  barbecue burger  okay  they keep giving me  a hamburger  with lettuce  tomato  and cheese  onions  and I said  I'm not leaving  I want a western burger  because I just got my kids  from Taekwondo  they're hungry  I'm on my way home 
[03:16:30]  and I live in San Clemente  okay  she gave me another hamburger  it's wrong  I said four times  I said  I want it  she goes  can you go out  and park in front  I said no  I want my hamburger right  so then the lady  came to the manager  whoever she is  she came up  and she said  she said  do you want your money back  and I said no  I want my hamburger  my kids are hungry  and I have to jump  on that toll freeway  I said I am not  leaving this spot  and I said  I will call the police  because I want  my western burger  done right  holy crap  can you even believe 
[03:17:00]  people are just  hopeless  pathetic people  that do shit like that  yeah  this woman  obviously needs a life  the way she's babbling  just babbling  she needs an outlet  she needs someone  to talk to  you think that's  frustration  that is an absolute  like frustration  she's dealing with  her little kids  all day  what what opie  no she thinks  her shit don't stand  you think she's  so important  she's one of these  rich bitches  in a big SUV  San Clemente Laguna  Niguel  very well to do area 
[03:17:30]  I disagree  I think that when  you order a burger  and you want something  specifically  if it's not done  the police should be called  you are an ass  she has a fine life  oh my gosh  this woman has a fine life  that looks down  on people  maybe you didn't hear  specifically  oh but she requested  the burger  the western  she said western barbecue  wanted the western barbecue  and they're in there  mopping the floors  yes  they're in there  mopping the floors  she asked four times  that's right 
[03:18:00]  uncircumcised I'll bet  and she picked a little lad up  from taekwondo  and he wanted a burger  a western  as Tracy pointed out  and he's not getting the burger  well there's more  uh oh  now is that so hard  okay what exactly  is it you want us  to do for you  I send the officer down here  I want them to make  me the right  Sam we're not going to  go down there  and enforce your  western bacon cheeseburger  good  what am I supposed to do  this is between you  and the manager  we're not going to go  enforce how to make  a hamburger  that's why  that's not a criminal issue  there's nothing criminal 
[03:18:30]  so I just sit here  you need to calmly  and rationally  speak to the manager  and figure out  what to do between you  she did come up  and I said  can I please have  my western burger  she's a spoiled bitch  I would  so quickly  tell this bitch  I just can't believe it  man  I just can't believe it  I'm listening to this  I can't believe it  that people are out there  like  yeah  well maybe you didn't hear  that she already spoke  to the manager  and she said she wanted  her western burger  and the issue 
[03:19:00]  wasn't resolved  that's what 9-1-1  is there for  she want the cops  to come and make  her burger for her  making a burger for her  what did she expect  the cops  what scenario  played out  in this woman's head  when she  fantasized  what would happen  after this call  the cops come  screaming up  dude  she's one of those  chicks that want  to take somebody down  that's it  right  yeah man  they want to take  somebody down  man  throwing people  on the floor  cuffing them 
[03:19:30]  you're going down  you're going down  unbelievable  there was a breaking  news last night  desperate housewives  didn't come on  please send somebody  over here  why not  please  it's a rational call  desperate housewives  didn't come on  last night  we need somebody  over here now  yes and my father  cut his finger off  but never mind  that he's okay  unbelievable  the problem with all of you 
[03:20:00]  is that you hate women  and you're not  addressing the issue  she asked for her burger  to be done a certain way  shut up  shut up  she picked  on a hard day  picked the kids up  from taekwondo  from taekwondo  alright let's go back  to the call  there's more  of course there is  he said  I'm not dealing with  she walked away  because they're mopping  the floor  and it's all full of beds  and they don't want to  go through there  and  ma'am  then I suggest  you get your money back  and go somewhere else  this is  this is not a criminal issue 
[03:20:30]  we can't go out there  and make them  make you a  cheeseburger  the way you want it  well  that is  that  you're supposed to be here  to protect me  what are we protecting you  for  oh man  this woman has never been told  no in her life  you're supposed to be here  to protect me  she's absolutely right  shut up  the police are there  to make things right  and she's not being protected  drop the mop  and pick up the burger  drop it  make this woman  her burger 
[03:21:00]  or we'll send in  the swamp team  maybe you don't realize  but Burger Kings  are the ones that said  have it your way  oh well now  well hey  now I might have to  agree with Jimmy  did she make that up  now I might have to  agree with Jimmy  not have it our way  while we avoid suds  have it your way  suds on the floor  that's right  have it your way  well now you might have  turned me down  what happened with  the rest of this  hope  you're supposed to be  here to protect me  what are we protecting you  from a wrong cheeseburger  no  it's just like  is this a harmful cheeseburger 
[03:21:30]  or something  I don't understand  what you want us to do  well  just come down here  I'm not leaving  no ma'am  I'm not sitting the deputies  down there over a cheeseburger  you need to go in there  and act like an adult  and either get your money back  and go home  I'm not acting like an adult  herself  I'm sitting here in my car  I just want them to make my kids  a western burger  now this is what I suggest  it's just you get your money  back from the manager  and you go on your way home  okay  okay  bye bye  good  yeah  nice  good 
[03:22:00]  hang up on that  I hope that operator  was reprimanded  what are we protecting you  from a bad cheeseburger  I think she understands  the problems in the service industry  and I didn't like her attitude  at all  really  it's not professional  you asshole  look  you guys can do what you want  she should have sent the deputies down  and they should have dragged this woman  out of the truck  and then raped her mouth  just raped her mouth  they absolutely  should have sent a car down there  and arrested the woman  making that call 
[03:22:30]  yes  for tying up police resources  that should be obstruction of justice  absolutely  there should be some kind  penalty  that woman should have been put in jail  her kids  should have been taken away from her  because she obviously isn't responsible enough  to have children  and they should have had  their little taekwondo uniforms  ripped off  while they were bodily searched  for evidence  of burger  malfunctions  send them to  Neverland  have Michael watch  while she  sorts out her legal problems  just open that little yellow belt  and rip down 
[03:23:00]  those little white taekwondo  slacks  these women are divorcees  man  yep  they gotta be frustrated  no I think this woman  I don't think she was divorced  I don't think there's any frustration  in her personal life  I think this woman  her husband probably  knows nothing about her  doesn't care about her  it's a loveless marriage  she's got the kids  she's got some cash  living down there  in Laguna Niguel  or San Clemente  nice area  southern California  she drives home  to her big house  she has a husband  that doesn't even talk to her  she doesn't talk to him  so she's probably lonely 
[03:23:30]  she's spoiled rotten  she does get everything she wants  but she doesn't get the attention  that she needs  so this was  reaching out for attention  and being spoiled  and trying to get  what she wants  and what she should have gotten  was an egg sandwich  in a cell  that crappy egg sandwich  they give you  right Jimmy  you know what that tastes like  don't you  no well  we had bologna  when I was in the  bologna  oh the afternoon menu  that's right  I didn't know  they changed that over  I didn't eat it  because I had a log  the size of Heather Mills leg  lodged in my colon  imagine if I take one bite 
[03:24:00]  of anything  I'm going to shit my pants  and it's a jail cell  30 crips  yeah it was really awful  oh my goodness  30 crips  I don't want to be doing that  but that woman  absolutely should have been  isn't that amazing  arrested  it's the type of woman  that you just want to see  somebody drink  like five  Pabst blue ribbons  not even a good alcohol  a bad stinky breath  wow  a real  I drank 11 Meister Brows  and I plowed into her car  with a bulldozer  I don't know what happened  but I'm sorry  that she can't move  below the neck 
[03:24:30]  ever again  little bloody geese  in the back seat  strapped in  that's right  that's right  two yellow belts  and a million questions  of what could have been  somehow  in the  somehow  in the wreckage  a little Barney video  is still playing  on the screen  of the SUV  I love  I love  it  it sounds like  a little skip  Shrek 2  just still playing  as the bloody geese  are strapped  safely in their seats  the little character  is still talking  no idea that there's 
[03:25:00]  two headless geese  staring at him  you see a little  Westenburger  roll across the street  still in its package  that's right  the woman is  the last thing she ever did  was clutch the bag  with the burger  she didn't want in it  that's it  a couple of sudsy Mexicans  try to help her  out of the wreckage  how ironic  they know she can't feel  anything below the neck  so they squeeze her tits  while she stares  openly  like she's on succinylcholine  like the Exorcist 3  lady we hate you 
[03:25:30]  wow  just a filthy burrito breath  in her face  see  that's the way  we play out  what would have happened  they just give it  a little squeeze  while the police come  it's the worst  of Opie and Anthony  so you're thinking  of smoking the pot again  yeah  if I'm going to go  to rehab someday  it's not going to be  over a wine  like Billy Joel  Billy Joel  what a dopey thing  to go to rehab for  dude you know what  if it ever gets to the point  where I have to go to rehab  oh I'm going to come up  with some stuff  for the press  something good

Yeah, and he's married to, like, a 23-year-old or something crazy like that?  Of course.  It's Billy Joel.  How bad can your life be if you're, like, pushing 60 and you're married to a 20-something-year-old?  Yeah, it's nice.  Wake the fuck up, Billy. 
[03:29:30]  He's definitely taking on an Uncle Fester look, though, isn't he?  It's getting pretty creepy.  By the way, a really, really, really nice guy.  Oh.  Oh, sorry.  Really?  Yeah, extremely nice.  Let me guess when you met him.  Could it have been at B.A.B.?  At B.A.B.  Charity Begins at Home.  Charity Begins at Home.  Bob Buckman with Billy Joel here.  Yeah, well.  Yeah.  So he's out of rehab today.  That's one of the big stories.  Yes, Jimmy?  Dude, I think that she's just married to him because he's Billy Joel.  Yeah?  Wow. 
[03:30:00]  You're going out on a limb there, Jimmy.  I'm just telling you.  I'm just telling you.  I've been dreaming of going to Mars, where mutants drive plastic cars.  So I go there.  You know the rest. 
[03:30:30]  The best part is the girl with three breasts.  Totally.  Re-dun.  Re-callin'.  Totally.  Re-callin'.  So I'm on Mars.

All right.  Okay.  I don't, I don't think it's improved. 
[03:32:30]  Because I, I don't know the fingering.  It's not working.  Johnny, grab my hand.  Grab, grab your bass.  XM202, the O.P. and Anthony show.  XM202, the O.P. and Anthony show.  You want to play, uh, what's happening in your town?  Yeah, but I, we need some type of music. 
[03:33:00]  Anything.  Some type of happy.  But, and this is the birth of a bit.  The next time we play this, we'll have circus music, we'll have a nice intro from Steve.  Don't you think, don't you think the, the story will play better with a nice musical bed?  All right.  Good point.  I think so.  What do you got?  It's good music.  I mean, what is it?  It's that wacky 50s, happy whites of the neighborhood music.  What's happening in your town?  Wait, let's make sure the music's good. 
[03:33:30]  And now, spanning the country to find the stories affecting you.  What's happening in your town?  Anytown, USA.  Let's go to Ohio.  Dave?  Yeah, how's it going, guys?  Dave.  What's happening in your town, Dave?  Hey there, little Kia Sack.  Hi, Dave.  So, okay, I live in Akron, in Cleveland Papers.  There's, in one of the black suburb communities, there's a guy running for mayor, and he was  such a good fella, and helping out the kids in the neighborhood, and, well, one night they 
[03:34:00]  were out, he was out arguing in his car with his wife, and, uh, I guess he ended up putting  one in her head.  He shot his wife in the head in Cleveland.  Thanks, Dave.  That's terrific.  That's terrific.  Well, that's what's going on in Cleveland.  All right, let's go to Tennessee.  What's going on in your town, Scott?  Hey, are you there?  Yeah.  Yes, we are.  Okay, I didn't know if it was right, Scott. 
[03:34:30]  But the headlines read, fuck it up, please, and there's like five E's in it, and then  underneath that it says, Pastor Kisses Goat After Losing Bet.  What bet did he lose?  Uh, you want me to read it?  Well...  Yeah, word for word, all of it, slow.  Sounds like a cute, touching story, which has no part in this segment.  Well, it might.  Right, it's a cute special interest story.  Pastor Fucks Goat?  Well, perhaps that would work.  Well, what bet did he lose? 
[03:35:00]  Uh, Living Springs Baptist Church, the only church on Weekly Lane near Catsville Pike,  departed from the usual service this Sunday when the Reverend Milton Hicks lived up to his  promise he made to kiss and kiss a goat.  It seems the children's missions class were issued a challenge to raise $750 for a special  missions offering.  If the money raised exceeded the goal by $100, the minister of music, Tony Hicks, would be  forced to kiss a live goat.  And if the fundraiser exceeded $1,000, the pastor would have to join in the fuckering up. 
[03:35:30]  Wow, and that's on the front page of your paper?  I swear to God, the Newly News Journal.  This is great.  All right, thank you, sir.  That actually matched up to the music.  Yeah.  Why don't you hit the Benny Hill music for the next one?  Oh, what's happening in your town?  Let's go to Dave in Kansas.  Dave?  Hello?  Yes, what's happening in your town, Dave? 
[03:36:00]  Well, we have a young boy who got in trouble for having paintballs all over his room.  Oh, those darn kids.  He got kind of mad at his father and went and got the key to the gun cabinet.  And shot him in the face.  He shot his dad in the face?  With a shotgun.  With a shotgun.  Fantastic.  Thank you, Dave.  Let's go to Fan Dick.  Fan Dick, what's up?  Hey, what's up, man?  Headlining the Miami Sun Sentinel.  Well, judge grabbed abortion requests to 13-year-old Palm Beach County girl. 
[03:36:30]  Fantastic.  Abortion requests to 13-year-old.  Wow.  Let's go to Rhode Island, Wayne.  Good girl.  Hey, guys.  What's going on?  What's happening in your town, Wayne?  Hey, remember that kid, that stupid idiot that killed the cop in Providence and jumped  out the window?  And got the crap beat out of him.  Yep.  Well, last week, they had him handcuffed in the front.  He took out a correctional officer's mouth. 
[03:37:00]  He fractured his jaw, broke his eye socket, spit in another guy's face.  Then yesterday, they'd taken him to court, and the freaking idiot wouldn't let him shackle  him, so they had to pepper spray him again.  You guys are morons.  Anyway, I'm punching out.  You know it's bombing when they throw in the editorial?  That guy's stupid.  That guy's an idiot.  Ah, that makes the story all right.  That was the point of my story.  Right.  What are you guys going to help me? 
[03:37:30]  I love this wacky.  I love the callers that just are waiting for us to save them.  Waxing horrific, yeah.  This is the only talk show where we don't save you.  We're not going to save you.  Because we could easily jump in and say something.  Yeah, that guy's mad.  Yeah, yeah.  That guy was a jerk.  Yeah.  You don't understand.  We're rooting against you.  Right.  We're hoping you fail miserably with every call.  Derek in Massachusetts.  How you doing?  What's up, Derek?  Well, we got this guy who's trying to save his farmland for his cows. 
[03:38:00]  The government there is trying to sign him $150,000 for his cows for the farmland.  He's going to take his land from him.  Well, this guy's got protests set up all over the place.  He did a protest on the Boston Commons saying he wants to save his cows.  He's got protests going on downtown in front of the school now.  And to save our cows, we can regrettably farm our land anymore because the government wants their money.  Are there any other stories?  Not really. 
[03:38:30]  This is a small town.  Thank you.  He goes, thank you.  Sean in Philly, what's up?  What's happening in your town, Sean?  Well, there was two old ladies, and they were trying to get the cheap tickets to the matinee theater and tried to beat the train.  And according to the paper, despite flashing lights, ringing bells, the train horn, and shouts from horrified onlookers,  they walked right in front and got hit by a train doing 70 miles an hour.  That's terrific. 
[03:39:00]  That's terrific.  Wonderful.  Let's go to Wisconsin.  Chuck, what's happening in your town?  Hey, guys.  A man in critical condition after falling off stool.  A Hubertus man who fell off a bar stool while celebrating his 53rd birthday over the weekend  was in critical condition Monday with head injuries.  He was knocked unconscious following Sunday evening at the Whiskey River Tavern on Highway 175. 
[03:39:30]  53 years you make it, and you die in the Whiskey Tavern by falling off your stool.  Drunken idiot.  All right, let's go to another story from PA, Anthony Ray.  Yes, my name.  What's up?  I got a hot teen bear attack in the Poconos over the weekend.  Hot teen bear attack.  I guess two teenagers are up there, and a big bear attacked them,  and one of the guys was stabbing the bear, and then the bear grabbed the girl and stripped her clothes  and, I guess, let her go after that after she placed that. 
[03:40:00]  Smart bear.  Yes.  Stripped the girl's clothes off.  Do you think that's just the story they're telling?  She's telling her parents.  Goes into the woods with a couple of guys, and they take her clothes and run.  Yeah, it was a bear, I swear.  Human claw marks on her body.  Well, and the bear raped me in the ass.  Bear load on her back.  Here's a story you can expect from Texas, Anthony.  Let's go to Dwayne.  Dwayne?  Yeah. 
[03:40:30]  What's up, Dwayne?  Hey, not too much, man.  Hey, a 75-year-old man, he got caught.  His niece walked in on him, caught him fucking the golden retriever, man.  He was in full stride when she walked in, and then this was a second offense.  So now, you know, they can't do nothing to him, but they're going to get him for indecent  susposure.  Indecent what, sir?  Indecent exposure.  Wow. 
[03:41:00]  Indecent susposure.  You're a mush-mouthed hillbilly.  Thank you.  We're going back to Philly and talking to Josh.  Josh, what's up?  Yo, what's going on, guys?  Hey.  Got one out of Chester, PA.  Three shwoogies took a little swimming pool, little plastic ones with a little slide on  it that a two-year-old would use.  Took it out into the river to try to use it as a raft.  Flipped it over.  Two of them were pulled out by somebody that was going by with a stick.  Third one learned the hard lesson.  Shwoogies don't swim. 
[03:41:30]  Oh, my God.  Jesus.  I'm sorry for that.  Let's go to Dugout Dug in VA Beach.  Virginia Beach.  Hey, guys.  T-line Virginia Beach.  The tips of the Bible Belt.  I got a jet flying over me.  Isn't that nice?  Yeah, perfect timing for your phone call.  Isn't that wonderful?  Rather than...  If it crashes, it'll be foreshadowing.  All right.  Get it, Dug.  Rather than fight, FM 99 WNRR will remove its controversial billboard, which features the 
[03:42:00]  bare backs of three women.  Because it's bare back of three women.  The bare back of three women.  Don't you guys just miss regular radio?  Well, what's the billboard say?  It has to have a cute saying.  Nah, it just says FM 99 WNRR has the back of three women.  And apparently, the city of Norfolk has pressured them.

I hate him anyway.  Cool.  Hey, guys.  I hope he dies in that car.  Kidding.  Go ahead, Pat.  One was about a girl, a 17-year-old girl, and accidentally, she burned her house down, 
[03:43:00]  and accidentally killed her brother and sister because her stepdad was molesting her.  And now they arrested stepdad on a bunch of porn charges for molesting her.  And the other one, this chick gave birth, a 17-year-old girl, gave birth to a baby and  hid it in a basket, and then went to a hospital, said she'd been raped, and now the baby's  retarded, and she's going to court for child negligence.
