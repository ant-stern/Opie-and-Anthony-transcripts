<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast covered a wide range of topics, often transitioning abruptly between them.  It began with the hosts expressing bewilderment at the media's focus on Nora Ephron's death, leading to a discussion on fads (email, pet rocks, hula hoops), long-distance communication, and the evolution of cell phones and car phones.  They reminisced about AOL chat rooms and the differences between early online picture sharing and readily available pornography.  A review of the new Spider-Man movie followed, comparing varied reviews and discussing 3D movie technology, along with nostalgic reflections on childhood movie-going experiences.  Finally, this segment concluded with a humorous anecdote about their friend E-Rock's excessive penny candy purchase, contrasting his spending habits with their own.

The second segment opened with a discussion about television size and its supposed correlation with marital status. This devolved into a caller's complaint about abysmal AOL customer service.  The conversation then jumped to a Guns N' Roses concert, focusing on Axl Rose's decline and a fall on stage.  Further tangents included a comparison of Magic Johnson and Larry Bird's attractiveness (with a joke about HIV and Magic’s youthful appearance), NYC Mayor Bloomberg's portable AC unit, a running gag about deceased professional wrestlers (with numerous caller corrections and arguments about wrestler names and death dates), a Twitter video of a girl with Down syndrome singing (provoking discussion of the show's controversial nature and the hosts' personal experiences with racism, sexual deviancy, and guns), Amari Stoudemire's homophobic slur fine, and a model's anecdote about a C-list actor's advances on a plane.  The segment ended with teasers of upcoming controversial stories about a news item and a lawsuit involving a Little Leaguer.

The third segment started with a discussion of Kenny's new website, transitioning to Mike Baker's Twitter avatar – a picture of him in an armored vehicle with a machine gun in what appears to be an Arab country. This sparked debate about displaying weaponry online and comparisons to World Star Hip Hop. Anthony defended his own karaoke video featuring a gun. Mike Baker then joined the show in studio, and they extensively discussed his avatar, national security, intelligence leaks, and the lack of consequences for leakers. Baker shared anecdotes from his career, including using his baby as a surveillance asset, his frustrations with leaks, and his preference for experienced pilots. A humorous skit involving a fictional "Detective Club Soda" interrogating a self-proclaimed hitman named "Little Chippy D" followed. The segment concluded with discussions on parenting, the changing nature of army men toys, and more anecdotes from Mike Baker's life, including his father's WWII service.

The fourth segment began with a discussion about a fan visiting the studio.  This shifted to a discussion of home security with Mike Baker (President of Diligence), including a brief advertisement for Diligence.com. The focus then moved to a mysterious audio clip – ultimately revealed to be from an explicit 8-track pornographic recording, which was played on air. The ensuing conversation covered childbirth, whether women experience orgasms during childbirth, a documentary film on the topic, changing parenting dynamics, and listener calls detailing unusual experiences (including cutting feces to fit down a toilet, stepping in feces in an elevator, and self-treating a hemorrhoid with a razor blade after consuming hashish).  The hosts shared personal parenting anecdotes and opinions on modern child-rearing. Mike Baker remained in studio for much of this segment.

The final segment started with a caller, "Wees," recounting a defecation incident.  This led to a discussion of dangerous childhood Fourth of July activities (airsoft, Nerf guns, bottle rockets, M-80s, improvised weaponry), injuries sustained, and the differences between past and present levels of adult supervision and legal repercussions.  Mike Baker joined in, sharing his own explosive childhood escapades, including an incident involving a military-grade explosive simulator.  The segment featured the frequent use of highly offensive language and concluded with a brief discussion of the show's app malfunction and a final live read by Jim Brewer, filled with more reminiscing about reckless childhood behavior.  The use of highly offensive slurs was prevalent throughout this segment.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  Good morning. Welcome aboard.  Enough of this palaver. Let's get the show on the road.  Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes.  Nora Ephron died. And we don't know really who she is.  And everyone's talking about her. 
[00:00:30]  And we feel out of touch about it. Right?  I have no fucking clue.  MSNBC is still talking about her 15 minutes later.  I guess she did. You've got mail or something.  I guess she like wrote one of those writers.  Yes. She's a writer of like chick flicks or something.  Wrote screenplays. She directed a little bit.  And she died, I guess. 
[00:01:00]  Well, she had leukemia.  She fought so hard, Marty.  You're such a super lady.  Why are they talking about her at this length?  Because she did You've Got Mail.  What do they say?  That she captured the email craze with her movie You've Got Mail.  She captured the craze of email.  The craze of email.  You know that fad?  The pet rock?  The mood ring?  Email? 
[00:01:30]  I guess that's where we can start today.  The craze of email.  The craze.  Was it an actual craze?  I don't think something that is around now, that's still like around and bigger than ever and just keeps progressing and stuff, can be considered a craze.  Right.  Like the hula hoop was a craze.  For how many years, you think?  Frisbee dogs.  A craze.  Well, I still see a Frisbee dog every once in a while.  Yeah, but not quite.  See, you could.  It's not quite as big as it was like in the 70s. 
[00:02:00]  Yeah.  Where you tie that bandana around his little neck.  To show everyone else or to tell everyone else, I got a Frisbee dog.  I got a Frisbee dog.  That's the only reason you did the bandana thing.  Right.  Because if you didn't have the bandana on, you'd just have a dog.  No, I just got a dog.  Oh, no.  I got a Frisbee dog.  I got a Frisbee dog.  Look at him go.  Look at him jump.  Those fuckers can jump, though, man.  Those Frisbee dogs were impressive.  I brought this up a while ago, but I'm always amazed when I see the wide world of sports  back in the 70s actually had a Frisbee competition that they televised, and I think it was like 
[00:02:30]  in the Orange Bowl or something.  It was in a giant fucking venue.  It was big for a while.  Yeah.  What was it called?  Ultimate?  Yeah, Ultimate Frisbee.  Ultimate Frisbee, I think.  Frisbee dogs.  Where you could run up the field, but if you grab the Frisbee, you're the one that's got  to stop, right, and then you've got to try to move the Frisbee forward.  Yeah.  Yeah, it was a big deal.  Yeah.  I had nerdy friends, and they always wanted to play Ultimate. 
[00:03:00]  Hey, you want to play some Ultimate Frisbee?  Huge.  I hated Ultimate Frisbee.  Yeah, I hated anything.  I liked Frisbee except for just trying to throw it.  I liked throwing a Frisbee until I got a little older.  Holy fuck.  Why?  Throw your arm out?  Oh, my God.  My nephew was visiting for an afternoon, and we went down in the water.  Just to throw rocks?  Holy fuck.  You wake up, you're like, ow.  Ow.  I was saying ow at the time.  Oh, really?  What the hell happens to your arm when you get older? 
[00:03:30]  Throw it out.  He's 12, 13, out throwing me.  I'm like, oh, yeah, well, I'm going to fucking throw one now.  Throw a few rocks into the fucking lake, and you've got to have Tommy John surgery.  It's not fun.  What happened?  What the fuck happened?  I know we give a young appearance, but fuck.  I can't throw rocks anymore.  Yeah.  I mean, because you really want to throw them.  You know, there might be a buoy or something you're aiming for.  You want to give it a good toss.  Yeah.  Fuck.  But anyway, the craze.  Yeah, that's what we should talk about. 
[00:04:00]  Email craze.  The email craze.  You're right.  These crazes last sometimes only a few months.  Yeah, and then they're done.  Email wasn't a craze.  That was a fucking innovation.  Just an innovation that took over?  Took off.  It was kind of a craze at first, though, I guess, to be fair.  To all of a sudden go, wait, I could go to my computer, or actually go to the office computer,  because most of us couldn't afford the home computer yet.  Didn't have one at home.  And all of a sudden, wait, people are just writing me right now, and it's coming in instantly? 
[00:04:30]  What's that about?  Well, when you grow up like us, where you had to wait, you had to put a letter in the  mail, and you would, all right, the letter would go in the mail.  Like, I had a long-distance girlfriend, so I know this pretty well.  Yeah.  She lived in Utica.  And in the summer, we wrote each other.  So I would write her a letter.  Yeah.  It would take two or three days to get there.  She was anxious to get that letter and respond immediately.  Uh-huh.  And then she put her letter back in the mail.  Think about this. 
[00:05:00]  That is fucking crazy.  So I would get my response four to five days later.  Five days, probably.  And that would be like, wow, that was fast.  Oh, I'd be excited.  And then I'd turn around and write another letter and send it off.  Now you could do that within seconds.  With fucking texts, not even so much emails.  Right.  You just text.  It would have been very interesting to write letters like you'd write texts now,  where it's just, you just write LOL on paper and mail it out.  And then another one, uh-huh, mail that out. 
[00:05:30]  Why don't we start that craze?  Yeah, start that craze.  Let's bring back, man.  That'd fucking bring the post office right back.  Right.  Right back again.  If you have to put stamps on letters where it just said, okay, ha-ha.  Yeah.  WTF.  LLS is my favorite.  Oh, yeah?  Laughing like shit.  Really?  It's a little cooler than LOL.  I, um.  Or maybe it's not so cool.  Um, but getting back to that, because I, think about this.  Why is this guy writing a fucking colon and a bracket? 
[00:06:00]  I don't get it.  We, uh, we grew up in a time where we weren't really allowed to use the house phone, because  long distance calls were ridiculous, remember?  Oh, yeah.  So if you had a long distance girlfriend, and the only way to communicate, uh, with her  was to fucking write her a letter.  Write a letter.  And then every once in a while, my parents would go, okay, you could call her.  Oh, thank you.  Yeah.  But only for ten minutes, so you have to get everything in in ten fucking minutes.  It's long distance.  Hurry.  Right.  It's long distance.  I'm not made of money.  The kids have no fucking idea.  No.  You forget that. 
[00:06:30]  If you, if you called, like, the next town over, it was expensive.  Can I use the phone?  Is it local?  Yeah, exactly.  Is it local?  Jeez.  And local meant within the, within a few blocks, a few streets.  By the way, uh, kiddies, um, when you made a local call, you didn't even have to put  in the fucking, uh, area code.  You dialed seven numbers.  That was it.  I still try to do that.  Doesn't work.  I know.  Every, even if you're fucking, you know, 212.  I know.  You gotta dial 212.  I still like old school. 
[00:07:00]  One, two, one, two.  And do the seven numbers and go, man, why isn't this working?  It was weird when you had to dial an area code, you're like, whoa, I'm fucking, I'm  going out of bounds on this one.  Right.  Look out.  Sam just put up something on the screen.  Two out of, two out of our three interns don't remember living in a time before email.  I was just talking to them about it either yesterday or the day before.  They don't remember the internet ever not being in their house.  Is it because, uh, they're young or stupid?  Both.  Which one?  Oh, okay.  Young and stupid. 
[00:07:30]  How old are they?  18, 19?  20.  20?  20, yeah.  Man.  So a 20-year-old doesn't remember living without email, probably doesn't really remember living  without a cell phone.  Yeah, I bet you.  Holy fuck.  We're getting old.  Yeah, by 2000, I would say, I would say the late, like by 2000, everyone pretty much had  some form of cell phone.  Dude, me and you were late to the party and we got, we had cell phones in 90, because I  remember, because I got one and then your wife at the time got mad because I had a cell 
[00:08:00]  phone and you wanted, it was so stupid.  That fucking bitch.  Remember that?  She wouldn't let me have a cell phone.  I got a cell phone and then of course Ann wants a cell phone.  I'm like, why can't I have a fucking cell phone?  You don't need one.  Why would you need to carry around a phone?  You could, I'll tell you what, and then she's like bargaining with me.  I'll tell you what, you could get a car phone.  Who, what am I, Canon?  Oh my God.  I need a fucking cell phone.  She wanted me to have a car phone with a big piggly, wiggly antenna on the back window. 
[00:08:30]  You know, we were, we were happening.  We needed cell phones to make some deals.  I needed a cell phone to hook up with other women.  That bitch.  I have my good boy car and my naughty boy car.  How the fuck can I have that with a car phone?  Maybe she was on a break.  Maybe she was onto something.  Maybe she was.  She knew, man, that she had to keep those reins tight because you were about to flee.  She knew.  That'd be hilarious.  I'm jumping between two cars to make calls. 
[00:09:00]  Right.  What are you doing in that car?  Nothing.  In all fairness, I think she was onto something.  Yeah.  Maybe.  She was the one that wanted to have a fucking lesbo experience, not me.  She sure did.  I was ready to jump right in, but Jesus Christ.  Which led to some things.  I didn't bring it up for the love of God.  Well, it led to some feelings that you had inside.  It unleashed some feelings in me.  Yeah, some feelings inside.  I got feelings.  Oh my God.  The feelings in my dick.  But I remember getting a cell phone.  We were up in Boston, 95 to 98. 
[00:09:30]  Probably the first year we didn't have cell phones.  So I'm thinking, I got my cell phone 96-ish.  That's late, I think.  That's pretty late.  You got it 96?  You got that StarTac thing?  Yeah, I had a StarTac.  That was when we first got to Boston?  And I thought it was the greatest thing ever.  You got that?  I don't know.  I think it was a year after.  I don't think I got it right away.  Because, dude, I didn't get my first cell phone until after I was breaking up with the wife.  You didn't have one in Boston?  No. 
[00:10:00]  I know, right?  Awkward.  Oh my God.  There's my phone right there.  My first phone.  Yeah, you were...  That was me.  No, that one.  Mobile operator, get me 555-1313.  That was my first phone right there.  The StarTac.  There it is.  The Motorola StarTac.  That thing was space age, motherfucker.  You were like Kirk with a communicator.  The antenna wasn't even that big.  It was nice.  I don't think you could text with that, though.  I got a phone with an antenna.  Whoa, it was great.  Didn't have an antenna on the outside.  It was an antenna. 
[00:10:30]  Yeah.  Of course, I didn't get a signal either, but it was great.  I don't think the StarTac...  I don't think you could text back then.  No.  No, that was strictly phone calls.  So when did texting start?  You got to pull the fucking antenna out with your teeth.  Texting was like after...  They tried to do...  Motorola came out with two-way pagers.  Oh, right.  Remember those that were like pagers, but they had the keypad on them, right?  The...  Yeah.  Those?  Ooh.  Oh, speaking of which...  On my phone.  Speaking of which...  Magic sounds.  Speaking of which... 
[00:11:00]  Well, it's Brother Joe.  Well, how about he calls the show if he's got something on this?  No, please.  I'm a fan of the Brother Joe.  No?  Oh, yeah, there we go.  No, he was doing some kind of blues guitar contest thing.  Yeah.  And he was doing very well and level, level up, level up.  And then he went to this next thing, which was for New York State, and I guess he lost  to some little punk kid.  He lost to a kid, though?  I don't know.  He said some fucking kid.  Yeah, it was, I guess, some music store thing. 
[00:11:30]  I'm a loser.  Some kid from New York City won it.  He had 20 family members there.  It was a popularity contest.  Oh, that's the worst.  Oh, Joe.  Poor Joe.  Joe's too good, man.  I know.  He should be playing with Blue Oyster Cult by now.  The cult.  Blue Oyster Cult.  So, then when did texting start?  Texting probably started, like, in the early 2000s, 2001-ish? 
[00:12:00]  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Let me, let me, let me.  So, 10 years.  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  We've only had texting for 10 years-ish?  Yeah.  It was kind of proprietary at first, wasn't it?  Like, you had to be on the same fucking thing.  Yeah.  All right.  And you had to pay by either character or message or something like that.  Oh, it was crazy.  Yeah.  Yeah, yeah.  Well, they're going to go back to that shit.  They want more money from us.  They're going to figure out how to get, well, they're starting to figure that out with the  4G, right?  Yeah.  They're figuring out how to get more money from our cell phones.  They're, um, what they're doing now is, uh, they're canceling these, um, plans that are, 
[00:12:30]  uh, like, unrestricted.  The grandfather?  I got a grandfather plan.  I'm grandfathered in.  So am I, man.  That's why I never left AT&T at the time.  Think of the word unlimited?  What am I, fucking nut?  Yeah.  Uh, yeah, unlimited.  They're canceling that shit.  Hmm.  Yeah.  That's too bad.  So, the point is what?  Oh, uh, you've got mail.  Was, yeah, right.  Being an email craze.  But I, I think it was kind of a craze when you realized, holy fuck, you gotta be kidding 
[00:13:00]  me.  Now you can just get, you know, instant messages from people you care about.  Oh.  I remember how exciting it was, though, when you were just in an AOL room, um, trading  pictures.  That was awesome.  That was great.  That was amazing.  You've got mail.  You've got mail.  You've got mail.  Ah.  Then you're like, oh, God, I gotta dig up a pick now to put it out there.  Yeah.  I'll use that one.  Poof.  I used to just steal a pick and re-  Yeah.  And re-enter it into the room.  Whatever.  Yeah. 
[00:13:30]  My family's AOL account used to always get locked and my dad would have to call AOL  because I'd get violations of terms of service.  What were you doing?  I kept going into chat rooms and pretending to be wrestlers.  You wouldn't even, all that shit that you could do online and you, again, fucking wrestling.  Wrestling instead of porno?  I would pretend I was gold dust.  And then convince people of that and then they would report me for lying.  How did they report you for lying?  Like, who cares?  You also forget that with those chat rooms, no one really got to see amateur pictures. 
[00:14:00]  That's true.  Now we just take it for granted, all these Twitter accounts and whatever.  But, you know, when email first started, you didn't even go and get an amateur magazine.  And when you did, you could tell that it was just dirty fucking pigs that weren't good enough for porn.  So they weren't even real amateurs.  You know what I mean?  It wasn't some fucking girl from LSU in her dorm room.  Yeah, yeah.  I like the ones in Hustler, though, and, like, Swank that have the girl next door. 
[00:14:30]  But they weren't the girls next door.  No, they were just skanks.  They were skanks trying to make it.  But that was kind of cool, too.  Yeah, I guess, in a way.  They were just regular skanks.  But my point, it got way better.  Yeah.  And then when you were in those AOL chat rooms, and, man, when someone had gold, like, oh, I got something.  Do you have something?  And you look at your file of pictures like, oh, maybe I could try.  Maybe I could put this one in there.  Yes.  And then you would see if that picture would bite.  Yeah, yeah.  And then, like you said, if it was a shitty picture, you would wait, and maybe one asshole would, you know, do a... 
[00:15:00]  Yeah, yeah.  Where's the You Got Mail one?  I got this.  Oh, my goodness.  You got this.  Oh, my goodness.  Or you get these when you're in a good room.  Remember when you started a room?  Oh, man.  Yeah, yeah.  You just hear all that.  I remember I started a room called, I think it was called, I know Soapy was in the room title, and Boobs. 
[00:15:30]  Oh, there you go.  Soapy Boobs or something.  And I remember I hit it, man.  I started this room, and next thing you know, everyone popped in.  Is this it?  No.  I don't have the You Got Mail.  But anyway, if you had something, you throw it in there, and like you said, your fucking email would explode.  Oh, it would fucking go crazy.  Like, all right.  Because it was the honor system.  Hey, man, you gave me one.  It really was.  Here's my best picture.  There was no fucking. 
[00:16:00]  What were they called?  GIFs?  Yeah, yeah.  Some of your GIF.  There was no concept back then that you'd be able to go on the internet and just get free video porn of any topic you want.  Right.  That's all it is now.  I don't know who's fucking, you don't have to trade with anyone or fucking find or pay for it.  There you go.  Two seconds, and even Sam.  Even Sam, who we know is a complete fucking moron when it comes to the internet. 
[00:16:30]  Just the dumbest, most incompetent piece of shit when it comes to punching stuff up on the internet and radio that he can't possibly exaggerate.  Yeah, you would call them GIFs.  Yeah, GIF or JIF, sure.  No, well, it was a JIF, but everyone would go, I got a GIF for you.  Got a GIF.  I got a GIF.  And who doesn't remember the slow motion scrolling from the top of the picture down? 
[00:17:00]  Right.  Where you would see the hair first and then eyebrows, eyes, it would just take forever.  It was like making a quilt.  Yeah, yeah.  Making a titty quilt.  A titty quilt.  Why are we talking about this?  Because this broad died.  Yeah, yeah.  I guess she was a big deal on Hollywood.  Screenwriter, author, director.  You got mail.  Yeah.  Did she do Harry Met Sally?  Sleepless in Seattle.  She did the Sleepless in Seattle. 
[00:17:30]  I wonder if...  Which was all three of them, pretty much one movie.  Yeah, it was the same fucking movie.  What is that?  It was the same dopey movie.  Nobody's mentioning she also did the 2005 remake of Bewitched.  Oh, that was her?  Wow.  Wow.  Welly, well, well, welly, well, well.  Oh, boy.  Speaking of movies, Spider-Man getting a shaky review on the cover.  Spider-Man?  On the cover of the newspaper today.  Yeah?  I saw a two-star review.  What is Rotten Tomatoes giving it?  Let's see.  I'm seeing the Spider-Man tomorrow night or tonight. 
[00:18:00]  Oh, you are?  Toon toon.  Toon toon.  Going on one of those screenings.  Toon toon toon toon.  I blew off Ted.  Fuck Ted.  Fuck the people that are in Ted.  Fuck them all.  That's what I said.  Yeah.  If you want to go see Ted, that's up to you.  But I ain't supporting these assholes anymore.  Yeah.  81% for The Amazing Spider-Man on Rotten Tomatoes.  So we had some dick that had to be different in our paper?  Hmm.  We have the dick?  Give me the paper.  Let's read the Spider-Man review. 
[00:18:30]  You got it funny there?  Um.  Give me those papers, please, Sam.  Yeah, the papers, the papers.  So if it's 81 positive reviews, then we in New York have the dick that has to be different.  There's always somebody that has to just be a dick.  Remember the Hall of Fame discussion yesterday?  Mm-hmm.  There's always got to be someone that goes, they know it might be a good movie, or this  player should be in the Hall of Fame, but they have to be different.  81 positive reviews, huh? 
[00:19:00]  81%.  81% is big.  I don't see the Spider-Man review, though.  C-Pulse.  Where the fuck is Pulse?  It says C-Pulse.  What is that?  Where's Pulse, Sam?  You got to go to the Pulse section.  Pulse, two stars, poor Spider-Man.  His big screen adventures that set box office records in the early part of the century have  been dwarfed by Batman and his fellow superheroes, the Avengers.  The notorious production travails of Broadway's Spider-Man, Turn Off the Dark, made Peter Parker's 
[00:19:30]  alter ego an international laughing stock for months.  International laughing stock.  That's what you want to be after millions and millions of dollars.  Well, Lou Luminick has to say this.  The Amazing Spider-Man, more like barely adequate.  Oh!  What a dick!  That's the barely adequate Spider-Man?  Is that what they're doing for the reboot?  Yeah.  He's not amazing anymore?  No, he's going through the awkward stage.  The barely...  That's great. 
[00:20:00]  I'm not coming close to living up to that adjective in the title.  Sometimes dull and mostly uninspired, it's much less a satisfying reboot like Batman Begins  than a pointless rehash in the mode of Superman Returns.  Oh.  What a dick.  What a tool.  He has to be the dick.  What a dick.  He is a dick.  What a dick.  That's why I like this Rotten Tomatoes.  We've been onto the Rotten Tomatoes for a while because your local paper could have the dick  that has to be different.  Yeah.  Ours does.  So a lot of people might assume, oh, I'm not going to see Spider-Man because our guy 
[00:20:30]  gave it two stars.  Two out of five.  Barely adequate Spider-Man.  Barely adequate Spider-Man.  That just doesn't quite put him over like amazing.  What a drop-off.  He's just like, I don't know.  I'm kind of tired.  Barely adequate.  Barely adequate.  That means he gets soft boners. 
[00:21:00]  He gets you out of a parking ticket.  That's like all he can do.  It's sort of a boner.  Yeah.  It kind of gets the job done.  Bah.  Read some of the other reviews from Rotten Tomatoes.  I want to see the wordplay, please.  I kind of fucking like those Spider-Man movies, though.  I liked every one of them.  I liked the Tobey Maguire ones.  Yeah, yeah.  Tobey Maguire ones.  Especially that first one was fucking great.  That first fucking Spider-Man was good.  Then they all kind of, hmm.  The time they got to the third one, it was a little tired. 
[00:21:30]  But that was a great first one because they went through the whole thing of how he became  Spider-Man.  He's like a fucking wimpy shit.  Right.  That was a good one.  I liked all of them.  Jimmy was in it.  Jimmy was in it.  That's right.  Yeah.  You get a review with some wordplay?  Let's see.  How about some fucking ass play?  Variety.  A mostly slick, entertaining, and emotional, involving recombination.  What a long-winded piece of shit review this is. 
[00:22:00]  A mostly slick, entertaining, and emotionally involving recombination of fresh and familiar elements.  I have no idea what that said.  Is that good or bad?  It tells you nothing.  It tells me nothing.  I hate these guys that just add a lot of words.  Oh, right.  We get it.  I've got to show how intelligent I am, so I'm going to use a lot of big words, and I'm  going to put a bunch of extra words in there.  I have a thesaurus.  Yeah.  The Hollywood Reporter.  What's another word for thesaurus?  Hollywood.  A word book.  I have a word book. 
[00:22:30]  Hollywood Reporter says, leaving back onto the screen with a new cast, crew, costume, and  a whole new array of daddy issues.  The Amazing Spider-Man reboots the top-grossing Marvel franchise to altogether satisfying results.  Too many quieter moments for a movie that's being geared up as a big summer action movie,  and that causes severe pacing problems from ComingSoon.net, which is credited as a positive  review.  Oh, really?  Wow.  Uh-oh. 
[00:23:00]  So, uh, they're saying too many quiet moments.  Are they trying to make it, like, a little darker so they get these quiet, somber, it's  fucking, uh, where he's kind of just brooding moments?  You think he's going to be reflective?  I bet it's a lot of reflecting and a lot of brooding.  You think he's going to be sitting on the top of a bridge?  Yeah.  Oh, gosh.  In the dark?  In the darkness?  Oh, on top of the bridge?  Overlooking the city?  Like, oh, I got a lot of responsibility here.  With his, like, Spider-Man's, like, squat thing that he does?  And he's going to be brooding and looking.  Or sitting on the edge of a really tall building. 
[00:23:30]  Oh, boy, I got a lot of work to do for this city.  God, the weight of the world is on my shoulders.  And no one knows.  No one knows I'm up here just reflecting.  Oh, Spider-Man, Spider-Man, give me some Prozac Spider-Man.  He's all fucking depressed.  Right.  Brooding.  If you only knew what I'm dealing with down there.  I bet there's a lot of, like, epic music, right?  Yeah.  He's, like, on top of one of the big ornamental things on the tower of the Queensborough Bridge. 
[00:24:00]  Right.  And he's doing that squatty Spider-Man thing.  Yeah.  And the camera passes fast and wraps around him.  One of those helicopter pants?  Yeah, yeah, like that.  And he's just all fucking, like, like, oh, fuck, man, I'm Spider-Man.  Well, I think it starts with a close-up of Spidey.  Yes.  And then it pulls out to just show how just overwhelming the whole thing is.  That he's just that tiny thing in this massive city.  With Gert power comes Gert response T.  Right.  What?  Exactly.  What? 
[00:24:30]  And then he's going to have a moment where I don't know if I could do this anymore.  I don't know.  I don't know.  The job might be too big for me.  Yeah.  I might have to, like, just give this whole Spider-Man thing up.  Ah, but he can't.  Why?  Because of a girl?  Yeah.  It's because of a girl, because he knows, uh, you know, he's the guy.  He's got a fucking...  What the hell is this?  Is this, uh, the trailer for Spider-Man?  Well, this is a video game.  They put ads before trailers now.  What?  A trailer for a video game before the trailer? 
[00:25:00]  Really?  The hell's going on?  This is the trailer of the commercial?  The hell is going on.  I'm very confused.  Very confused.  You know, I was, um, I was writing the other day with a pen.  What?  And I realized, like, what is this, the 1800s?  What, he got a quill?  Hey, wait a minute.  Was that just...  I think that was just the scene I fucking talked about.  All right, pause.  Pause.  Hey, wait a minute.  I swear I hadn't seen this.  Well, we know.  I know.  We know this is going to go down.  Just know.  Go to the beginning.  Let me see that fucking... 
[00:25:30]  Superheroes have to show they're, uh, human.  The exclusive four-minute super...  Four minutes.  Four minutes.  The most anticipated film is the whole movie.  The Amazing Spider-Man.  In theaters everywhere, July 3rd.  July 3rd.  All right.  There's the bridge.  Well, that's, uh...  I think that's the RFK bridge.  Is it?  Yeah.  How about you call it to Triborough?  All right.  Well, he's doing his Spidey stance.  All right.  He's on top of the tower.  And he's crouched down, like we said.  It's a sweeping shot.  All right.  All hells.  Oh, man, it's a monster getting somebody. 
[00:26:00]  Cloverfield all over again.  Off of, uh...  We all know it's the Triborough bridge.  Stop at the RFK bridge.  Swinging on some webs.  It's a strong-ass web.  He had to take his mask off if the kid was freaking out.  That's kind of funny.  You know what?  I got no problem with this so far. 
[00:26:30]  There you go.  That's it.  Aw.  Wait.  Wait.  The mask makes you strong.  No, he just, like, get the kid motivated.  Oh, I got you.  Like, I'm fucking Spider-Man, motherfucker.  I thought it was a new, like, uh...  Superpower.  No.  Oh, shit.  Oh, no.  He falls.  Oh!  Woo!  What happened?  He fucking got him out of the car with some web, yo!  Oh.  Who are you?  I'm Spider-Man.  I'm Spider-Fucking-Man. 
[00:27:00]  Just say it.  Yeah.  I'm going to answer the question.  That's what you think.  That's all Jerry Sandusky was doing.  Trying to get kids out of the shower using his own web.  He was throwing web at children.  Yeah, motherfucker.  That's so strange.  How do you ever stop looking?  Looking for what?  Truth.  Oh.  The truth.  Okay.  Oh, man.  And then you got the shots in here.  You know, come on.  Him just winging down the streets in Manhattan.  Mm-hmm. 
[00:27:30]  I don't believe what the police are saying, do you?  You could always tell a movie in New York what year it is based on the police cars.  Like, all right, this is a pretty new movie.  Cop cars look new.  500.  That seems a bit excessive.  Damn, yo.  Spider-Man gets some pussy.  If you're going to steal cars, don't dress like a car thief.  You found my weakness.  It's small knives.  Spider-Man's a little bit of a braggart. 
[00:28:00]  Tell us a little bit about yourself.  What does your father do, Peter?  My parents left when I was very young.  Dennis Leary was going to be fucked in real night.  Christ, is this a long trailer?  He said four minutes.  Four minutes.  God, you're good.  He's way too much.  I lose your partner, son.  Hey, is that the guy from Fargo?  No.  No.  Get it.  I thought he was in there for a second.  That'd be awesome.  On July 3rd.  Ready to play Gob.  What's that? 
[00:28:30]  What's his name?  Biological attack.  Is that that guy?  Is that the guy?  I don't know.  Based on the trailer, this looks fucking awesome.  What's the problem?  You've got to stop him.  I say it's more than adequate.  I think the fucking Rotten Tomato, Rotten Tomato guys are fucking faggots.  No, Lou Lumineck.  Lou Lumineck's a faggot.  He stinks.  I don't like that.  This looks amazing.  It's great.  It's fucking great.  Is that Gary Altman?  I don't know. 
[00:29:00]  Who's that?  Wait.  Uh-oh.  What happened?  Oh, shit.  Oh, shit.  Was that a dirty bomb?  Oh, shit, no.  I'm looking at the movies.  That's how I hear movies.  Oh, shit, no, Spider-Man.  Oh, shit, no, Spider-Man.  Hell, no.  Why they got to do him like that?  Why they got to do him like that?  You want to play football?  What's the hip-hop?  Too dangerous.  I say football too dangerous.  Get it?  What?  Oh, my God. 
[00:29:30]  But why would football be dangerous if he's Spider-Man?  Why?  Just a little irony.  Is that where the joke is?  Yeah, you got it.  Ah!  I don't get it.  Rotten Tomatoes is the worst.  When they mark bad reviews as good, this one is also a positive review.  It's an efficient piece of corporate filmmaking, but nothing more.  That's positive?  That's positive.  That's a positive review.  So they're cheating with their positive reviews.  They certainly are.  Hmm.  Hmm.  I don't know.  That looked fucking awesome.  Oh, is it in 3D? 
[00:30:00]  Yeah.  Yeah.  Oh, shit.  I'm all about the fucking IMAX 3D now.  Did they film it as a 3D movie, or did they put that 3D and shit later on?  They filmed it as 3D.  Because there's a difference, you know.  I like the subtle 3D, man.  I don't like the in-your-face, I'm at a Disney attraction, honey, I shrunk the fucking audience 3D.  Don't you hate when the movie has to tell you, this is in 3D, watch, we're going to  throw stuff at your face now.  It's going to fly at your face.  And it has nothing to do with the movie?  I don't like shit coming out of the screen.  I like being able to look into the screen in 3D. 
[00:30:30]  I don't mind if it's coming at you, if it's part of the story or whatever, but you can  tell at times.  What was it?  The Superman movie.  Uh-huh.  Remember?  Yeah.  Where there was a plane scene, and there was a cell phone, and it was kind of coming  at you.  Oh, right.  They only did, what, the first 10 minutes of the movie was in 3D or something?  Oh, right?  Yeah, something like that.  I think so.  That fucking Superman was terrible.  Awful.  What made it bad?  Kevin Smith put it best.  He was like, you know, if I'm watching a Superman movie, I'd like to see him maybe punch somebody. 
[00:31:00]  Like, there's just nothing happening.  Yeah.  I don't even.  It's the most boring fucking.  At this point, I don't even remember the movie.  See?  I couldn't even tell you what happened.  Many persons in this country.  Who's the villain?  Lex Luthor, played by Kevin Spacey, I believe.  Oh, right.  Wow.  Good for you, Sam.  Very good, young Sam.  Don't even remember that.  Very good, my young Padawan.  So, Spider-Man.  This guy.  We're going tomorrow or today.  Is it today?  Tomorrow? 
[00:31:30]  I think you're going tomorrow night.  Going tomorrow night to see it.  Dennis Leary's coming in next week, I hear.  Oh, yeah?  To promote a little bit.  He's got a big role.  Good for him.  On that 3D thing, I was watching Friday the 13th Part 3 on DVD, and it was not in 3D.  Right.  And so you just watch it, and you're trying to figure out why on earth there's a shot of somebody playing yo-yo directly into the camera.  Exactly.  That's right.  And then you remember.  What's that about?  Oh, I see.  Because without the 3D, it makes it even look more ridiculous.  No sense at all.  But that's the point we're making, where they have to show you, no, look, see, it's 3D. 
[00:32:00]  Yeah.  I want to remind you, it's 3D you were seeing.  It's nothing.  You know, Avatar fucked themselves.  I know a lot of people, it's cool to say how much that movie sucked.  I really liked Avatar when I saw it in the 3D theater and all that.  Yeah.  And I saw it on TV a month or two ago, or parts of it.  It's unbelievable how bad it looks, because it's not in 3D.  Really?  Yeah.  They should have just sacrificed that and said, you know what, we can't fucking put it out this way.  They should have. 
[00:32:30]  Yeah.  Taken the hit.  I don't know.  Because it's a completely different movie.  It's goofy without the 3D.  It's horrible looking.  It's in between like a real movie and a cartoon when you see it without the 3D, if that makes sense.  Yeah.  It kind of does.  Sure.  Yeah, there's some 3D movies that, like I said, Prometheus was fucking killer in 3D.  Right.  Fucking looked great.  Vast. 
[00:33:00]  I like a vast movie.  Mm-hmm.  It's giant.  That movie didn't do well, though.  Not as well as they thought it would.  It kind of fell off a little bit.  I think in like a DVD and cable release, it's going to do pretty good, too.  International, it did.  This guy, Chris on Long Island, he goes, worst 3D movie ever, Jaws 3D.  Well, yeah.  Oh, man.  They didn't have the technology yet, really.  Remember that one?  That was like the early days.  God.  That was so...  109 million? 
[00:33:30]  Yeah, it would cost 130 to make.  I mean, foreign, it's made up for it.  No, it's a hit.  Yeah, foreign.  As a hit, it'll make its money back, but I think they were expecting better numbers  than that, no?  Big summer.  I read a bunch of...  Don't worry, no spoilers.  I read a bunch of stuff on Prometheus because I had a lot of questions, much like Troy Kwan.  But I read a bunch of stuff on it, and it started kind of making sense, and I will absolutely  see it again.  And I think that's going to do well for the movie because it's one of those that I think 
[00:34:00]  you have to see a couple of times to kind of get it.  And me with the Alien movies, I have seen them quite a few times, so I'll do the same  with this one.  I had no desire.  Really?  Yeah.  Yeah, I've always been into those movies, though.  I'm not a big sci-fi guy.  That's my fucking...  My thing.  My forte.  Right.  I like that shit.  I like that shit.  Tough guy.  Are people going to the movies as much?  For some reason, it does seem like people are still going to the fucking movies. 
[00:34:30]  They're not going for every little thing.  I mean, remember when just horrible B-movies would do well in the movies because it was  like, you'll have one theater in your town.  It seems like people are just being more picky about movies.  Yes.  When I talk to people, that used to be a discussion.  You would talk about all the movies that were out at the time, and I just don't hear that  as much anymore.  Or on Facebook or whatever, there's one movie that hits and everyone goes to see, and maybe  a couple others, but that's it.  You used to go to the movies once a week. 
[00:35:00]  Yeah, especially as a kid, man.  Central Islip, there was a movie theater around the corner, and you used to walk there.  Yeah.  You know, when kids were allowed out of their house to actually walk alone.  You never had play dates, huh?  You just went outside and played.  No, you just went out.  You're not allowed to do that anymore.  You got thrown out like a fucking drunk.  It was like parents yelling last call at a bar.  You'd be in the house.  It's nice out.  Get out.  Right.  You know, there's evil out there, Mom.  Yeah, there's evil outside.  There's evil in our own woods.  You can't stay here. 
[00:35:30]  Leave.  Fucking get...  It's like you're being thrown out of a bar as a kid.  And then you'd leave.  You'd go out.  Hang out with your friends.  Go to the movies.  Right.  Can I go to the movies?  I need some money.  Right.  And then I used to sit in the movie theater from Saturday morning.  Mm-hmm.  When the movie theater opened until like late afternoon.  Oh, God.  Watching the same movie.  I think I watched Kelly's Heroes like three times in a row.  That's a long movie, too.  Yeah.  That was pushing three hours.  Well, the TV version is usually three hours. 
[00:36:00]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  It was a couple hours long in the movie theater as a kid.  But I do remember that.  Me and my Mexican friend, Adam Yonke.  Ah.  See, I had very diverse friendships.  What happened?  As a kid.  I don't know.  Hey, and I know why you saw the movie three times in a row.  Yeah.  Because back then, you couldn't sneak into other movies because they only had one fucking movie.  One fucking movie.  If you want to see another movie, you had to get back in your car or whatever the fuck and go to another theater.  Someone's reminding me what year Kelly's Heroes came out. 
[00:36:30]  Oh, God.  Yes, I know.  I don't even want to know.  Shut up.  How old are you?  Have you been lying all these years?  I think I'm like 1970.  Oh, boy.  A child of the 80s seeing a movie in 1970.  Yeah, it's 1970.  Oh, my God.  How old are you?  Come on.  I was a little kid sitting in a movie theater.  Have you been padding your age all these years?  Never.  All right.  Look at the picture on the box cover.  Yeah.  That's Donald Sutherland.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  He didn't look like that when he was in here today.  No, no.  He was a tank driver, and he was a cool tank driver guy. 
[00:37:00]  Wow.  Don Rickles down in the bottom right.  Clint Eastwood.  Telly Savalas.  Those are four massive stars.  Who loves you, baby?  Massive stars right there.  Of course.  And three out of the four still alive.  Not bad.  Not bad right there.  That's true.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Trout of the 80s.  Poor Telly.  Hey.  Telly was missing most of his year.  Telly Savalas.  He used to come to the golf course I caddied at every once in a while, and everyone would 
[00:37:30]  be starstruck like, oh, my God.  Kelly Savalas is on the course today.  Players club card, baby.  Kelly Savalas is here.  Yeah.  Stravos.  He was missing like an ear.  I think he was missing part of his thumb.  I'm like, he had parts of him.  What the hell's going on with him?  He had parts of his body missing.  Kojak.  It must have been his left ear, because look, I see a lot of pictures of him where he's  showing his right ear.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  And I don't think the prosthetics were good back then.  I don't, uh, I didn't know that.  Oh, yeah.  It was the big talk on the golf course. 
[00:38:00]  Kojak, he had the lollipop, remember?  Mm-hmm.  He was trying to quit smoking, I guess.  Gave him the lollipop.  Or maybe he was, you know, thinking the lollipop was something else.  Do you think he was, uh, I don't know about that.  Oh, I don't know.  I have no idea.  My name's Talkie Tina.  Remember that one on the Twilight Zone?  That was him.  That was Telly.  I didn't have hair back then either, baby.  He never had hair.  I was bald from birth.  He never had hair.  All the way up till death.  Who loves you?  Oh, the ladies loved him, though.  Oh, yeah.  He was a mess, but the ladies loved him. 
[00:38:30]  Oh, they certainly did.  Missing body parts.  Oh, what the fuck?  Flabby tits.  What the fuck?  Fucking no hair.  There's a People magazine cover from 1974.  He's got no shirt on.  Oh, my God.  He's got a few chains around his neck, and he's got tits.  Why would you agree to that?  What is he doing?  Man.  I think I have that same body now.  Fuck.  I can't be nude in People magazine.  Nude.  Look at me with my open shirt, baby.  Was he a Studio 54 guy? 
[00:39:00]  I think he was.  He must have been, huh?  He was on the party scene every so often.  Tally Savalas.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Doing some cocaine in the back, baby.  Mick Jagger.  There's his stupid lollipop.  Yeah.  Kojak Pops.  Oh, my God.  Did they try to market lollipops?  That doesn't go.  Lollipops and a tough guy?  That's weird.  That shit's cray.  Let's bring back the lollipop. 
[00:39:30]  Yeah.  Didn't really catch on, even with Kojak doing it.  Yeah.  What kind of lollipops did he like, you think?  Blow Pops.  Give me a blow pop, baby.  And then blow me.  Those dum-dums.  I said blow pop first, and then a blowjob.  Did he like the dum-dums?  Yeah.  Love the dum-dums.  I like the dum-dums.  I like a good dum-dum.  Stravos, give me a dum-dum.  Love you, baby.  Kojak.  So now where are we at? 
[00:40:00]  A Quinn Martin production.  Was that a Quinn Martin production?  I think it was.  Brother Quinn.  Brother Quinn, named for Quinn Martin.  That's the God's Honest Truth.  My brother Quinn.  Darren, named for?  Darren Stevens.  Darren Stevens.  I think so, yeah.  Scott.  My brother Scott, because of an astronaut that no one knows.  Do you even know?  Scott Carpenter.  There you go.  Yeah, one of the original Mercury 7.  And then my dopey name, Greg, is just because my mom's.  Greg?  My mom's best friend at the time's husband was named Greg. 
[00:40:30]  But ironically enough, Opie, you go back, even though that wasn't meant to be.  Fuck, it wasn't meant to be.  I hate the fucking name.  People know that, right?  God, it's him and a Speedo.  Look at my ball bag, baby.  Look at his pubes.  My pubes are sticking out.  His pubes are sticking out, and he's got a fucking shaft.  Stravos, I got more hair on my balls than on my head.  Is that all balls, or is that a shaft?  I say this is a shaft.  He's got a big Greek donger.  Big unclipped Greek dong. 
[00:41:00]  Baby.  Water's leaking out of my unclipped cock head.  Look, it's like a wet spot on his fucking.  At least he doesn't have baloney tits in that picture.  They just didn't have publicity people that approved every photo back then, did they?  I guess not.  Take a picture.  Put it in the publication.  I don't care.  I don't care.  I don't care.  Stravos, look at my ball bag.  Oh, shit, man.  So, Kelly's Heroes.  Yeah, Kelly's Heroes.  I like weaving through this shit. 
[00:41:30]  How did we start today?  You got mail, now we're up to Kelly's Heroes and Telly Savalas, and going to the movie theater  and only getting to see one movie, because that's all they had.  Yep.  One fucking movie.  And then when multiplexes started coming around, the local theaters had to get more movies,  so they did a great thing.  They cut the fucking theater in half and put two screens in there that were half the size.  Like, part of the allure of going to the single movie house. 
[00:42:00]  Oh, you should have forgot about that.  You used to have those massive fucking screens.  Giant screens with a curtain like King Kong was going to be behind it when they lifted it up.  Right.  And then they cut them into two or three movie theaters.  Holy fuck, I forgot about that.  And their soundproofing wasn't good, so you heard the movie next door.  I was about to say that.  It sucked.  I was going to tell you, I was going to bring it back in memory.  You used to sit in the theater, not so much these days, and your movie sucked.  And you hear, like, screaming and explosions coming through the walls.  It's ruined! 
[00:42:30]  Why the fuck didn't I go to that fucking movie?  Yeah.  Yeah.  The good old days.  The good old days.  But now you go to the movies, and I know we've talked about this a bunch.  Even if you're not making a lot of money, you have a better system at home.  Yeah.  It's so obvious now.  A lot of people don't.  I kind of hate it.  And I'm not an audio, what are they called, audiophile?  Audiophile.  I'm not one of those guys.  I got an okay system.  Yeah.  Maybe a little more than okay. 
[00:43:00]  But I go to these theaters, and you're like, you've got to update this shit.  Yeah.  We've got digital shit in our homes now.  Great stuff.  And you know what?  If you get a 60-inch fucking television, and you're watching it, yeah.  Which is easy now, by the way, Sam.  Yeah, exactly.  With all the money me and Hank gave you for your stupid wedding, you should at least get  a nice big huge TV.  Exactly.  Drop in the bucket.  That was put in the bank.  Oh, Christ.  Of course.  Oh, God.  Sam Roberts-Steam.  And I beg to differ, by the way, the theater experience is far superior to my home theater 
[00:43:30]  experience.  Of course, because when you had the chance, you went out and got a what?  18-inch or something?  I have a 32-inch in television in the living room.  Yeah, but the bedroom.  It's all about the bedroom TV.  The bedroom TV is 21 inches.  Oh, God.  But that's the bedroom TV.  Dude, when I was living in Buffalo making absolutely no money, I had a bigger TV.  Not a good investment.  Fuck investments.  It's not a smart way to handle your cash.  It's the only thing.  Sometimes everything doesn't have to be an investment. 
[00:44:00]  Your investment is in your pleasure and happiness.  Right.  And there's equity in that.  Right.  Even though the device itself loses value, there's a value in your enjoyment, isn't there,  in life?  I'm enjoying just...  No, you're not.  Just 5'1", 21.  If you had a big TV, you would enjoy...  And you're a guy that loves watching that dumb wrestling.  You know how that looks on a big screen?  No.  Oh, E-Rock knows.  He knows.  Castle Nagel's got fucking big screens everywhere.  Now you got the other side of the spectrum. 
[00:44:30]  Exactly.  The guy that just consumes constantly.  Oh.  In this corner, you got Sam, who's a little frugal.  Yeah.  He's a bit frugal.  And then in this corner, you got E-Rock, who just consumes everything around him.  You're why we're in a fucking recession.  I am?  Yes.  Start consuming.  You need more people like E-Rock to just spend, spend, spend.  E-Rock.  Yeah.  How much did you spend on candy at the state fair the other night?  Oh, God.  Be honest.  $32.  On candy?  On candy?  How could you?  On penny candy.  It was pick your own candy tent. 
[00:45:00]  They had a candy tent.  Oh, my God.  They had a candy tent.  He went in with the big, what the fuck, collection basket.  They give you basically collection baskets.  They give you church baskets.  Church baskets.  I call them collection baskets because I, you know, maybe the Jews do the collection baskets  too.  Wow.  Wow.  Although I doubt it.  Who counts the pennies after service?  Oh, boy.  Stereotype.  Bad one?  $32.  Is that a bad one?  Yeah, that's all right.  It's based on reality, though.  Of course.  You know how you, uh...  Always heard of these.  Well, I, uh...  Because of my experiences. 
[00:45:30]  It's all based on experiences.  Oh, boy.  Um...  They tended to be the cheap ones at the golf course.  I'll say it.  Oh, boy.  I'll say it.  So, uh...  Candy tent, penny candy, collection basket, and, uh...  E-Rock, $30, what?  $2?  $32.  $32.  On what?  On penny candy.  How do you do that?  Like atomic...  It's not penny candy.  It was penny candy.  They even had Mary Jane's.  They had shitty candy, matter of fact.  Oh, I hate Mary Jane's.  What did you buy?  It was like shit.  There was a bunch of great stuff in there. 
[00:46:00]  Great stuff.  Um...  I saw that he got a big league chew.  No, I didn't.  I thought I saw a big league chew.  No, I didn't get that.  Oh, maybe I just saw it and I thought you got it.  I apologize.  No, I did not.  Did you have something like that?  No, I had two...  Laffy Taffy or whatever?  Oh, yes.  Willy Wonka's Laffy Taffy.  Laffy Taffy.  I thought that was the big league chew.  That sucks.  $30 of Laffy Taffy's.  No, not $30.  I would have, like...  No, he got Smarties.  Chocolate bars.  I took a few of his Smarties for the right.  I like real candy, like Kit Kats.  Gummy Worms. 
[00:46:30]  Twix.  You got $32 worth of gummies?  Jolly Rancher bars.  See?  Jolly Rancher sucks a dick.  No, they're not.  Those are good if you want to yank your fucking fillings out.  I fucking hate Jolly Rancher.  Jolly Ranchers are some tasty fucking candy.  I fucked that shit.  Okay, stop.  I'd rather eat Betty White's asshole.  What do you...  It's a flame, though.  I don't know why I just said that.  It's so stupid.  What do you think...  That's the dumbest thing I'll say today.  I promise you.  Troy loses sleep to do his DJing gigs to make sure he can pay his rent.  Yeah. 
[00:47:00]  And then E-Rock, on the other hand, is dropping $32 on penny candies.  Well, yeah, but you're twisting this, Sam.  You are frugal, and E-Rock fucking consumes like a black hole.  Like a motherfucker.  Oh, yeah.  He is black-holing all of us.  He's just consuming everything around us.  I am America.  He's pricing out outdoor theaters for his backyard.  Oh, I hear he's trying to get an outdoor theater going at his house.  But see what Sam's trying to do?  What?  I think that's cool.  That's not...  See, usually we all gang up and beat the shit out of E-Rock, but I think that's cool. 
[00:47:30]  That'd be cool, like, for Ant to do...  A, I wish I had outdoor space.  And if I did, B, I would absolutely go down that road.  Because you're a millionaire.  Oh.  Multi.  Multi.  Jeez.  Multi-millionaire.  Oh, jeez.  You know?  And I mean, you deserve to be a millionaire.  Heading toward...  Heading toward nine.  Nine?  Is that...  Now we're getting direct?  No, no, no.  I got...  No.  No, I mean nine.  Nine numbers.  Oh, my gosh. 
[00:48:00]  Nine numbers.  Nine figures?  Heading toward that.  So I don't need this shit.  No, I'm just joking.  Because now people are going to fucking hate on that.  I'm struggling to stay in the fours.  In the fours.  The high fours, I hope, right?  High fours.  You're not...  No, you're above four.  Yeah.  I was in the fives most of my life.  I'm...  Most of my life, I was in the fives.  I'm swimming in it.  But yeah, I don't understand where E-Rock gets the cash for an outdoor movie theater.  E-Rock, how big is your TV in your bedroom? 
[00:48:30]  The bedroom is 36.  So he's got you by 15 inches in the bedroom.  Ba-da-ba-ba-da-ba.  Oh, man.  You know what that means.  I wonder how many inches is all your TVs combined?  Holy shit.  I've got 53 combined.  That's just the one...  I don't know.  The one in the living room's got you beat.  Well, got all my inches combined?  My theater screen's 11 feet wide.  I swear.  It's 11 feet. 
[00:49:00]  This guy, Jimbo, has a 22-inch TV and his sleeper.  Wow.  My sleeper in my bedroom.  Oh, God.  Damn, you're embarrassing.  I'm not embarrassing.  Did you hear fucking Jess's vows?  Beautiful, right?  That was pretty much...  No, I heard...  That was pretty much, you better step up, motherfucker.  No, it wasn't.  I read between the lines.  So did I.  That meant...  It's gonna be a fucking television, you cheap bastard.  That's not what she said.  That meant I need more inches in the bedroom.  No.  Ba-da-ba-ba-da-ba-ba.  I heard it.  I got it. 
[00:49:30]  No, that's not what she said.  Really?  She didn't even mention television in your vows.  It was between lines.  She used a lot of symbolism.  Love means television.  Oh.  Yes.  See?  She said, I need a bigger love.  Yes.  What'd she say something about, I'm yours forever?  That's inches.  Yeah.  More inches?  More inches.  She wants more.  More inches.  How could you sit there squinting at a fucking little TV?  It's no need to squint.  We're just in the bed.  It's not too far away.  No, it's far away because you're in the bed. 
[00:50:00]  You have to go all the way back to your headboard.  Yeah, but it's not a long room.  And then you got a few feet between the edge of your bed and the wall.  That's too far for 21 inches.  You're not an American.  Isn't this about 21 inches, this screen right here?  Oh, my God.  Yeah.  Almost.  Maybe a little less.  A little less.  All right.  I'm two feet in front of it, and it's good.  I figured it out.  I have 146 inches of television.  Oh, my God.  You just love consuming.  He does.  He rocks.  He just loves it. 
[00:50:30]  Castelnagel, though.  He is American.  A lot of rooms.  A lot of fucking wall space.  Plenty of places to watch cartoons.  Yeah, cartoons.  Drink Coke floats.  Wrestling so he could write his fan fiction.  Write SummerSlam fan fiction since it's almost August.  Oh, my God.  It sounds like the worst thing ever.  Doesn't that just sound horrible?  It sounds horrendous.  Then, oh, my God.  All of the sudden, out of nowhere.  I don't even know what that is.  Wait a minute.  Seemingly out of nowhere.  Oh, fan fiction is the worst. 
[00:51:00]  Eric Race WWE fan fictions.  The candy is 20 cents a pound, Iraq.  Oh, man.  No.  No, I think it's more than that.  This guy's saying it's 20 cents a pound.  How many pounds of candy did you get?  It was a big bag.  I don't know.  It was a big bag.  Did you eat it all yet?  Oh, no.  It's still in the kitchen.  That's bullshit.  It's still in the kitchen where it's readily available.  There's one Laffy Taffy just hanging out on the counter.  One Mary Jane half-bitten.  I'll leave you for later. 
[00:51:30]  I shall return.  Iraq's the American dream, though.  He is.  He really is.  We make fun of him, but this is what this country is made for.  If everybody was like Iraq, this would be...  It would be fucking unbelievable.  We would be showering each other in money.  You remember sitting next to him at the airport.  When he's sitting there with his earphones plugged in, he's got his whatever, his Nest T, his iPad is playing a movie, he's texting someone.  He's got every...  He's just everything.  It was the poster for America. 
[00:52:00]  Yeah, yeah.  You can't make fun, I'm telling you.  Iraq's everything terrorists hate us for is embodied in Iraq.  Sensory overload on every sense at the same time, always.  Yeah, his fingers were getting attention, his fingertips, his...  Touch, smell, taste buds, sight, hearing, everything.  Enjoying delicious treats.  Yes.  Oh, amazing.  Viewing multiple things, earphones plugged in.  He loves it.  BJ the trucker.  I have a 40 inch in my sleeper.  My speed... 
[00:52:30]  58 inch in my bedroom and a 48 in my living room.  Listen, one day I'll be able to haul as much shit as him, but right now...  No, not so much.  I guess I'm not on a trucker's budget right now, so I can't do it.  Yeah, but the TV is the first thing you just say, you know what, fuck it.  No, no, no.  Everyone will agree.  It doesn't matter how much money you have, you just go, fuck it, I need the best possible  TV.  No, that's not how I see it.  And you're way, way below that.  Yeah, no, no, no.  Significantly.  I'm definitely on one side. 
[00:53:00]  You know they line the TVs from worst to best?  I'm definitely...  I stick to one side of the line.  I know how much you make.  I'm not in the middle.  I know how much you make.  You should have a 50 inch in your bedroom.  It's splurging.  In the bedroom?  Yes.  That's not even close to going to happen.  You don't watch TV in bed.  Well, the living room is definitely more TV place.  You have a bigger TV in your living room, don't you?  Yeah.  Yeah, so you get the bigger TV in the living room.  Same size as my bedroom TV.  Is that right?  Yeah.  How big? 
[00:53:30]  I don't know.  It's not 60, though, and I'm very upset with that.  Is it bigger than 32?  Oh.  32 in my bathroom.  And because you said that, I'm going to now make the TV in my bedroom bigger.  What are you doing with the old bedroom TV?  I ain't giving it to you.  Why?  Because I know how you work.  I will smash that shit before I give it to you.  How about you smash my old TV?  We'll do a fun bit.  We already did that.  Oh.  We already did that.  Oh.  And then what did he do?  He turns around and gets a nothing TV.  Yeah.  It was still a nice HD Vizio. 
[00:54:00]  Vizio.  Vizio.  What is the Vizio?  Vizio.  It's got almost the word vision in it.  That's right.  Vizio.  And there's a Z, which implies future.  Yes.  Oh, really?  Zs are always using words from the future.  Yes.  Yes.  Where did we learn that?  I don't know.  It's just something in it.  It really does sound very futuristic.  Yeah.  There's no Z words right now, so you'd think in the future there will be.  A lot of Z words.  Oh, Toy Story.  Zerg.  That's exactly right.  Yeah.  Was it Zerg?  Zod. 
[00:54:30]  I don't know.  I didn't see it.  Zod.  Zod.  Zod.  Near before Zod.  Zerg is the Toy Story guy.  Zeus from No Holds Barred.  Oh, come on.  Oh, God.  All right.  Well, you should break.  Yeah.  This was fascinating.  Zenith TV started that.  Oh, thank you.  I'm coming from Connecticut.  Yes.  Zenith.  Started what?  The futuristic Z words.  Do they still make TVs?  Zorg.  Gary Oldman and Fifth Element.  Yes. 
[00:55:00]  See?  I've got to get a Zenith next.  That's true.  Zenith.  All right.  Oh, my God.  They're remembering her again.  Holy fuck.  What the hell?  Enough of her.  Nora Ephron, author, writer, director, dies at 71.  She captured the email craze in her movie, You've Got Mail.  But was email really a craze?  We started the whole show talking about that.  Bring it right back.  Look how we brought it right back.  Thought we could just start again.  You say, we'll talk about email being a craze when we get back, and then we just recycle 
[00:55:30]  this one hour.  Why don't we do that?  All over and over and over.  Now you're finally being smart.  There we go.  Like CNN.  The top of the hour, we just start the news cycle again.  Wait, when we come back, we're going to talk about email and whether or not it was  a craze.  Right.  Right.  Holy fuck.  What was the second thing we talked about?  Tell us if I was.  And you know what?  Email, baby.  I know.  And the reviews for Spider-Man are coming in.  Yes.  We'll tell you what our local paper is saying.  It's a little lackluster, but we'll tell you about it. 
[00:56:00]  After these messages.  The OPN3 Channel.  He's so horny.  Series XM.  Hi, this is John at AOL.  How may I help you today?  I wanted to cancel my account.  Sorry to hear that.  Go ahead and pull your account up here real quick.  Can I have your name, please?  Vincent.  Hey, Vincent.  That's the privacy and security.

How long have you had that?  Years.  Okay.  Well, actually, I'm showing a lot of usage on this account.  Yeah, a long time ago.  Not recently.  Last month was 545 hours of usage.  I don't know how to make this any clearer, so I'm just going to say it one last time.  Cancel the account, please.  Well, explain to me what's...  I'm not explaining anything to you. 
[00:57:00]  Cancel the account.  Well, what's the matter, Vincent?  I mean, we're just...  I'm just trying to help here.  You're not helping me.  You're helping me with the...  I am trying to...  Okay.  Helping me...  Listen, I called to cancel the account.  Helping me would be canceling the account.  Please help me and cancel my account.  No, I wouldn't, actually.  Cancel my account.  Turn off your account.  Cancel the account.  The worst thing that...  Cancel the account.  Is your dad there?  My dad...  I'm the primary person on the account.  Not my dad.  Cancel the account.  Okay.  Yeah, because I'm just trying to figure out...  Cancel the account. 
[00:57:30]  I don't know how to make this any clearer for you.  Cancel the account.  The card is mine in my name.  Okay.  The account is mine and in my name.  When I say cancel the account, I don't mean help me figure out how to keep it.  I mean cancel the account.  Oh, I'm sorry.  I don't know what anybody's done to you, Vincent, but this is...  You're annoying the shit out of me.  That's what you're doing to me.  Cancel the account, please.  Okay.  Now that goes both ways, my friend.  Good.  Can you please cancel the account?  All right.  If you want me to cancel this account, you're going to let me speak and give this paragraph. 
[00:58:00]  Okay?  Because if not, we can star you all day.  I really don't care, to be honest with you.  But you're going to listen to me if you want this turned off.  So, can I speak now?  Go right ahead.  Thank you.  Appreciate that.  As I process your cancellation request, let's attend about a free benefit available for value members like yourself.

[00:58:30]  If there's no catch, this is AOL's way of continuing our relationship with you.  We know you enjoy keeping your same email.  Series XM.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  Guns and roses, huh?  I wanted to comment about that phone call there.  Was that Sirius customer service?  Oh, man, right?  I see your tweets, people.  I see your tweets.  I don't know what to do for you, though.  There's nothing we can do. 
[00:59:00]  I don't know why we hear it.  They get so frustrated and they tweet us about customer service here at Sirius XM.  Satellite radio.  Satellite.  I don't know why we hear it.  And I get problems with the app.  Tweets every day.  The app.  I gave up on that a long time ago.  I don't know what to tell you.  Fuck with the app ain't working, dude.  I don't know what to tell you.  I don't know.  I do know this.  Guns and roses rule.  Turn it up.  Yeah.  Why are you playing this? 
[00:59:30]  You see the video of Axl taking a fucking face plant on stage?  I sure did.  That was funny as fuck.  What's up with the Axl?  People are trying to figure that out, right?  And he just sounded terrible, too.  It's too bad.  It's almost like he's doing a bad impression of Axl Rose.  Weird.  I don't know how you get the voice that high at this point in your life.  That voice wasn't that bad. 
[01:00:00]  That didn't sound bad right there, but when he was trying to get higher, it sounded a  little shaky.  I don't know what to say.  Oh, my God.  You know, I thought that was me.  You see that?  Where?  You see that, like, thumbnail?  Right?  Yeah.  Is that Jeff?  Who's that?  I look like Jeff Daniels now?  Oh, fuck.  What's going on with me?  More handsome than Jeff Daniels.  Oh, look at that.  Didn't that look like me?  A little bit. 
[01:00:30]  All right.  I squint.  Anyway.  Anyway, why are you playing Guns N' Roses today, consumer?  You know the song?  Whoa.  Get in the Ring?  No.  November Rain?  No, it wasn't November Rain.  Paradise City?  Brownstone.  Mr. Brownstone?  No.  Sweet Child of Mine?  Um, Yesterday?  Welcome to the Jungle?  Uh, Dust and Bones?  Dust in the Wind?  Um.  That's him.  Oh, man.  Uh, what album was that? 
[01:01:00]  Live and Let Die?  No.  Um.  It was off, uh, Use Your Illusion 2.  Night Train?  Eleanor Rigby.  That's the Beatles.  Oh.  Um.  Always get them confused.  Um.  No, I don't know that one.  It's called Pretty Tied Up.  Oh, Pretty Tied Up.  I said that.  Yeah, I said that.  Oh, I didn't hear you.  Sorry.  And you should listen.  I think I said it, too.  I said I should.  Uh, Pretty Tied Up.  Someone was tied up on this day.  What?  Yeah.  What?  Ooh. 
[01:01:30]  Um.  Why are you playing it?  The BTK Killer.  Oh, wow.  Come on, Eric.  He's going deep.  What?  He tied his victims up.  Bound, torture, kill.  That's a B part.  Oh.  I swear to God.  No, I can't say this.  He rocks the BLT Killer.  Oh.  See, because pigs are horrified.  Eat him really quickly.  I thought the BTK Killer had something to do with Burger King. 
[01:02:00]  No, you didn't.  The Burger King.  The BK Killer.  I couldn't figure out the T part.  James Cameron will film all three Avatar sequels back to back to back.  So, there you go.  And a belly to belly?  And a belly to belly with that.  Hmm.  I don't know.  You think the Avatar will have a shelf life?  I don't know.  The next one's got to be really good.  I wish you saw it in a theater, Ant.  Ah.  Because I really did like that movie. 
[01:02:30]  Bach.  I really did like it.  Nah.  I don't know.  It's a fucking stupid message.  Oh, you didn't like it?  Oh, we get it.  Ooh.  Humans suck.  Ooh, humans.  Ooh, the bad human.  We all know humans suck, right?  We all know from...  I know humans suck from when I was a kid watching, like, Mutual of Omaha's Wild Kingdom.  Like the leopard needs protection from the human, you need protection with Mutual of Omaha.  It was always some fucking thing, you know.  So, they're almost, they're at the brink of extinction, and they have no natural enemies, 
[01:03:00]  except for man.  Oh!  Ah, fuck us running.  We stink.  Will you stop showing people how old we are today?  What, Mutual of Omaha's Wild Kingdom?  Oh my God, do you want to look that one up, Sam?  Okay.  That's an old one.  That's when there was only three channels on the TV.  Hey, I'll stay here in the blind while Jim wrestles the alligator.  Yeah, the one dude who did all the work, right?  Jim Fowler.  He wound up becoming, you know, a wildlife guy of his own. 
[01:03:30]  Yeah, the old guy would just be...  Marlon Perkins.  Yeah, wow.  Very good.  He would be protected the whole time.  Yeah.  And he would just watch Jim get into all the action.  It was so staged, too.  It was very, it was scripted reality, that fucking show back in the day.  Yeah, they'd be out in, like, Plains of Africa, right?  The Sahara?  Oh, that's a desert.  They would show, like, some footage that they took somewhere.  But then, like, Marlon Perkins would make faces like, like, oh! 
[01:04:00]  They'd show him, like, get up, like, like, oh, something's happening with the lions.  Oh, yeah, reaction shots.  Reaction shots to shit that, like, he wasn't really reacting to.  But we didn't know back then there was a reaction shot.  We just assumed there was the action.  They couldn't spin the whole fucking thing around and get his reaction shot while they're trying to film lions.  Their equipment was too big.  Yeah.  What year was the Mutual of Omaha's Wild Kingdom?  Well, you have an out.  Because it ran from 1963.  Shit.  Until 1988. 
[01:04:30]  Wow!  That was around a while, huh?  Child of the 80s, motherfucker.  Child of the 80s.  So you guys are watching it in the 80s?  Sure.  The last few seasons is what you're talking about?  Sure.  Mutual of Omaha.  Mutual of Omaha.  The 80s?  I don't know that movie, the telly Savala stuff.  Like the snake needs protection.  How old do you have to be in the 80s to be a child of the 80s?  I feel like...  You need to have been...  Teenager?  Yeah, you need to have been a teenager.  Child of the 80s, motherfucker, right here.  For at least half of the 80s. 
[01:05:00]  No!  Oh, that's a new rule.  Shut up.  No.  No.  You just have to be in the 80s.  Why half?  Teen in the 80s equals child of the 80s.  We are.  Children of the 80s.  Teen in the 80s equals child of the 80s.  I'm a child of the 80s.  Nice.  Yeah, but if you were 19 in 1980...  That doesn't count.  Teen in the 80s equals child of the 80s.  That's all I need.  And I do meet your criteria.  I feel like...  I meet your criteria.  I am a child of the 80s. 
[01:05:30]  I feel like you have...  Thank you.  You have to be 19 no earlier than 89.  No!  No, you're making new rules now, man.  You have to just be a child during the 80s.  Yeah, teenager in the 80s.  Child of the 80s.  Hence, therefore, thus, me and aunt are children of the 80s.  You're ridiculous.  If you're in your mid to late 20s at the end of the 80s, you're not a child of the 80s.  Who says I was?  Oh, the 80s.  Who says I was?  Nobody has said that.  That's just a rule that I feel... 
[01:06:00]  Well...  Mid to late 20s or later...  That's your dumb rule.  You're not a child of the 80s.  So we got the Mutual of Omaha's Wild Kingdom.  Wild Kingdom.  Here's something.  So we did watch that show growing up, right?  Oh, sure.  How many of those animals are extinct now that they used to say were going to be extinct?  None.  You think none?  I bet none.  You would bet none.  Maybe the white rhino.  Oh, the poor white rhino.  I know there's like one or two left, but...  That had to suck to be the white rhino.  Oh, man.  They used to talk about the bald eagle a lot and that whole thing with extinction. 
[01:06:30]  Now they're fucking...  Now they're just...  Bald eagle's all over the fucking place.  They're amazing.  Now they're just a nuisance.  What a comeback the bald eagle had.  They're just a nuisance now.  Fuck.  They are a nuisance.  They'll take your kid away.  They're like flies.  You just swat them.  Yeah.  Fuck that.  Hawks.  Yeah.  They're not that special anymore.  I see hawks all day long here in Manhattan.  Manhattan.  Are these extinct animals?  Yeah, this century.  From what?  This century.  Animals that became extinct since like 2000-ish. 
[01:07:00]  What?  2000?  What, the last 10 years they went extinct?  That's right.  I've never seen that baha...  Well, let's start with the dodo bird.  I don't think those ever existed.  No?  No.  Was that a rip-lease, believe it or not?  I think it's a lie.  Extinct by 1681.  What?  Wow.  What is the, uh, baha...  Bai-hi-do?  Bai-hi-do?  Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.  The dodo bird was extinct when?  It says it was extinct by 1681. 
[01:07:30]  Why?  Human...  Humans didn't know what to do back then.  Introducing a species like dogs, pigs, and rats.  I thought the dodo was around a lot later than that.  Come on.  And what did they use it for?  Some kind of elixir?  The dodo bird?  To fight the Black Plague?  I don't know.  It was flightless, so I probably couldn't run away from technology.  Technology in 1681?  Oh, yeah.  Or whatever?  Catapults.  The baha-hi-dolefin, what was that about? 
[01:08:00]  I think it was prehistoric.  It's got a big bottlenose-looking thing on it.  It's got a very short dorsal fin.  It's kind of pudgy.  It's a white dolphin.  It looks like...  It looks like if E-Rock was a dolphin.  Pudgy and white.  Sorry, consumer.  Sorry.  I apologize to the consumer.  Keeping America alive.  He's rolling his eyes.  Is he?  Sorry about that.  They still existed in their only habitat, the Yangtze River in China. 
[01:08:30]  Oh, man.  Boy, talk about niche.  Yeah.  You've got to expand your horizons, lest you get extinct.  Then the chinkies there were doing their laundry and shitting in the river, probably.  I bet they were eating them, too.  And there goes the dolphin.  Functionally extinct is what they are, which means there's too few potential breeding pairs  remain to ensure that the species will survive.  So it's over, Johnny.  So why don't they get those damn fucking dolphins together and save this one?  If you've got two, you could save something. 
[01:09:00]  I bet they can't mate in captivity.  Yeah.  That's what happens.  Why?  They both got dicks.  They're shy.  Well, how about you push them toward each other?  Artificial insemination.  They're not attracted to each other.  So then you take his spermies and you shove it in the pussy of the other one.  Or just get one to rape the other.  Well, I didn't say that.  But you could.  Now, what's the next one that's extinct?  West African black rhino.  Oh, boy.  Extinct by 2006.  Yeah, world star hip-hop.  Wow, what happened to that? 
[01:09:30]  It was because of the stupid horn, right?  Everybody wanted a rhino.  People love rhino horns.  Love them.  They grind them up, snort them.  Didn't the activists start just, you know, sawing the horns off these things?  Yeah.  I remember seeing a special on that.  Yes, they would saw the horns off.  But wouldn't you still kill the thing for what was left of the horn?  I don't think so.  Because the horn would go inside a little bit, too, right?  Yeah, but they wanted, like, the horn, the outside horn part. 
[01:10:00]  So they'd saw the horns off so that the poachers wouldn't kill them.  Because why kill them if you can't get the big horn off of the goddamn thing?  And for the most part, that's why they were killing these things, right?  Yeah.  And what did the horn do?  Make your dicky harder?  Yeah, aphrodisiac.  And then other people would use it for your decorative things.  Gave you a turgid pud?  Yeah, turgid rhinoceros horn-like dick.  Just because it's soft.  I mean, hard.  What?  What?  Yeah, and then you got the golden toad. 
[01:10:30]  Yeah.  Wait, why do they, what were we right about the horns?  It doesn't say exactly why.  It says, after 48 field missions, no signs were found of their continued presence.  Wow.  Although evidence of earlier poaching remains.  So, yeah, it was poaching.  Eggs?  No, I think it was, uh...  Oh.  They got some DNA, because we could rebuild this shit.  We're going to rebuild all these animals again.  Like Jurassic Park?  Yeah, yeah.  Oh, yeah, we are.  Cool. 
[01:11:00]  We absolutely will.  And you get a dinosaur!  In the end, we will do no damage to this earth.  Oh, I know.  Once we're gone, forget about it.  In the end, everything will come back that was here before us.  Or they're just something new.  True.  Something new and exciting.  What's the next one?  Like, love.  Um, the golden toad.  TV?  What was the problem with the golden toad, that they're now extinct?  Uh, uh, it was only known to exist in a high-altitude ridge in Monteverde, Costa Rica. 
[01:11:30]  You know, these animals, it's their own fault.  Thank you, it's their problem.  It's their own fucking fault.  You can't figure out that there's a whole world out there and you've got to hang out on the same ridge?  You're putting all your golden toads in one basket, leaving them in a fucking one ridge somewhere.  Christ on a pony.  Yeah.  Get the fucking thing, uh, diversify.  Yeah, I'm not going to feel sorry for the golden toad.  Yeah.  If it can't figure out that it could, and it could hop, too.  How about you hop off the ridge?  Logan makes a good point.  Huh. 
[01:12:00]  Golden toad, uh, extinct and so is a golden bun.  Yeah.  I'm extinct.  That's unfortunate.  I was a one-of-a-kind, now I'm caught.  I'll extinct my golden bun.  He was the best.  Its demise is attributed to a combination of factors including airborne pollution and, due to its restricted range, global warming.  Oh, don't blame global warming.  Global warning.  Right.  What else?  Anything else in there that's...  Spix's McCall.  Oh, watch the fucking slurs. 
[01:12:30]  Wow.  What's wrong with you, Sam?  S-P-I-X.  Spix.  Spix.  Spix's McCall's?  Spix.  Aw.  S-P-I-X apostrophe S.  Mars wondering where his McCall went.  Oh, now Mars.  Oh, Mars.  It was native to Brazil.  Ah, Brazil.  What is it, a bird?  Yeah, it's a McCall.  Plane?  Birds suck, though.  Who cares?  Yeah, that's true.  Would you save any bird?  No.  Who gives a shit?  There's plenty of birds.  How about a canary or a parrot or a blue jay or a cardinal?  Why don't we need these specialty birds? 
[01:13:00]  No.  What about the shitty birds?  Like those dumb brown ones?  There seem to be a lot of.  Like the sparrow?  I think they might be sparrows, yeah.  They're just shitty.  They're not cool to look at or anything.  Or the robin red breast.  Well, that's kind of cool because it has the red breast.  I like a good cardinal.  That's what I'm saying.  Or a blue jay.  I see a blue jay every once in a while.  Blue jay, I see him in my backyard.  Blue jays are fucking cool.  They're nasty.  Motherfuckers.  If they make a nest in a tree, they will dive bomb the shit out of you until you go away. 
[01:13:30]  You can't walk around in your own yard.  They peck you?  They will dive bomb your head and get closer and closer each time.  So, they actually made a nest inside the top of one of the columns I have in my fucking  ostentatious backyard.  Damn, that's a big word.  Damn.  And they laid eggs in the top of this thing.  Yeah. 
[01:14:00]  And I didn't know until I saw them, like, nesting.  And then I came out and they started dive bombing me.  I'm like, holy shit.  So, I took little tiles that were laying around and covered up their nest with the tiles.  And they couldn't get to their eggs.  Oh, Jesus.  Oh, my God.  That's horrible.  That's horrible.  That's horrible.  Diabolical laugh.  What am I supposed to do?  It's a diabolical thing to do.  What the fuck was I supposed to do? 
[01:14:30]  And those babies get born and they're just in the dark.  Oh, those eggs were fucking finished.  This is what I would have done.  I would have put a helmet on.  Yeah, I boarded them.  I would have put a helmet on and I would have relocated the nest to give them a shot.  You can't touch fucking eggs.  No, they would have left the nest alone.  But they're dead anyway, so give them a shot.  No, look, I touched these eggs, but look, they're over there now.  They're still good.  I don't care.  I covered it up.  They were all distressed.  They're trying to get to their eggs, but they couldn't because I had put a fucking force field around it. 
[01:15:00]  They were pissed.  And then they went away.  And they never came back.  I was a caddy at the Huntington Crescent Club for many minutes.  They're winning that caddy tournament.  The only other job I really had.  Tell Ty Webb I'm gunning for him.  And you remind me of the Black Crows.  And the Black Crows, during the time they laid their eggs or whatever, it was a fucking horror show on the 1st and 18th hole because they were parallel to each other.  So you would start your round. 
[01:15:30]  And all of a sudden, you're just minding your business, going up the course with two fucking golf bags, some asshole that can't play golf.  It's hot as shit.  And you're sweating your balls off 1st hole, and all of a sudden, you'll get pecked from behind by these Black Crows because you're too close to their trees, I guess.  And the 18th hole, especially, was way worse.  And after a while, you would be on lookout for these fucking things.  And they would fly so low to the ground to get at you.  Yeah.  You would see them coming down the fairway as you're, like, halfway down the hole. 
[01:16:00]  They knew how to attack.  They knew how to attack.  And every time, you'd go, son of a bitch, you'd drop your fucking golf bags.  There were times we all would have golf clubs out, the members, the caddies, the grounds crew, and we'd be fighting these fucking things off just to play the last hole.  They're scary.  They're really scary, man.  When you get pecked by a bird, it's horrific.  It's fucking horrific.  Rob and Redbress are like rats where I live.  Oh, really?  There's plenty of them. 
[01:16:30]  Yeah.  There's a fuckload of those things.  What else is extinct there?  The Hawaiian crow is extinct.  The Hawaiian crow.  The last Hawaiian crows were found only in one part of Hakalao National Wildlife Refuge in Hawaii.  Why don't they just fucking find another place to live?  They got wings.  They got wings and they're fucking just sitting there.  They can fly wherever the fuck they want.  The last two known wild individuals of this species disappeared in 2002, so the species is now classified as extinct in the wild. 
[01:17:00]  Wow.  And the last one is the Perennian Ibex.  That's a crossword word.  Crossword puzzle word.  Perennian Ibex.  Yeah.  What the hell is that thing?  It's wacky.  It's got those.  It's a fucking longhorn ram.  Yeah, it's got those.  Basically.  It looks like.  Kind of.  See, you know what?  I don't consider that extinct because if I see a longhorn ram, I'm going to think it's one of these anyway.  There you go.  I mean, it's pretty much a goat.  That's enough.  Yeah, it's a fucking goat.  It's a goat ram.  It's still got goats and crows. 
[01:17:30]  Yeah.  Oh!  This extinction thing.  We got a little too technical.  Yeah.  It's like that Hawaiian crow.  It's a crow.  There's plenty of crows around.  We still got crows.  Wait, there's still so many rhinos.  Just because that West African black rhino.  Right.  That's called evolution.  It's called a rhino.  We do have rhinos, though, still?  Yeah.  And the nagel dolphin.  We still have regular dolphins.  Oh, the nagel dolphin.  Sorry.  He's calling it now.  Sorry.  The nagel dolphin.  The other word is too hard to pronounce.  That's the only reason.  Very good.  Let's go to our first phone call of the day.  This is Cole in New Jersey. 
[01:18:00]  Cole, make it good.  What's up, guys?  So, we're talking about all these animals.  I was reading the news recently, and apparently Australia has more koalas than people, but right  now the koala populations are being threatened because 50% of the koala population has  chlamydia.  Jesus.  That's great.  Can't they give them penicillin for that shit?  I don't know.  Like, apparently they're all going sterile, and they can't, like, you know, they can't  mate because of all this chlamydia going around. 
[01:18:30]  And then I guess they're, like, going into the cities, too, and they're, you know, they  can't mate because they move so goddamn slow.  Yeah, they really do.  Koala chlamydia.  Wow.  It's fucked up.  I don't know.  I mean, you know, I guess those Australians are freaky people.  They're giving, you know, koalas all that chlamydia.  Do you think it's from people fucking the koalas?  They are adorable.  Oh, my God.  Yeah, but they're vicious.  Do you think that's how it started?  I didn't know.  I tried to stick my dick inside a koala.  Koala?  I didn't know I had chlamydia.  Gave it to the bear.  Now he's got chlamydia. 
[01:19:00]  They can't mate.  My mate can't mate with a chlamydia.  Fucking Aussies.  You know what?  Sarah from Buffalo, a regular on the Twitter.  No H in her name if you want to follow her.  She writes, we don't need to keep the animals.  We got holograms.  Ah, that's true.  Let's hologram all this shit.  A hologram zoo.  If we could bring back Tupac, we could bring back the black rhinos.  Went to a hologram zoo.  That's true.  Saw some animals.  With chlamydia.  Tried to fuck them.  Tried to fuck a kangaroo once. 
[01:19:30]  Didn't work out.  Tried to hop away.  I fucked its patch.  A hologram zoo.  How do we get that going?  Man.  That would do well, man.  That would do well.  You gotta go dinosaurs, obviously.  Oh, fuck yeah.  Gotta go dinosaurs and some of those giant things that used to live in the ocean.  But then the petting zoo would be the worst.  Well, because your hand would just go right through it.  Yeah, it would just be shitty.  And they would come over and eat the food out of your hand and the food would just be sitting in your hand.  Nope.  Special glove.  Oh, that's a great idea. 
[01:20:00]  You put on the special petting zoo glove.  Oh, man.  And it feels like you're petting the animal.  And it feels like you're petting a dinosaur.  Through a series of sensors and actuators.  That's right.  We need investors.  I like this.  This could go.  Couldn't they just do this on the Wii?  Yeah, but it's cool to leave your house, though.  I think that would be pretty cool there.  Hologram Zoo and Jurassic Park.  Petting zoo.  Who wouldn't want to pet a dinosaur?  Getting bitten in half when you're on the shitter, either.  Hmm?  Yeah.  It can happen.  But one person has to die at the zoo every day. 
[01:20:30]  Why?  Why?  Just to make the experience a little more exciting.  I would flip off a dinosaur if it was a hologram.  Oh, man.  You are crazy.  Crazy.  What's it going to do?  What you going to do?  Have fucking Hulk there, dinosaur.  I'd be cutting promos on dinosaurs all day.  Yeah.  Fuck them there.  Listen, Mr. Velociraptor.  You're mine.  Queen Elizabeth, another regular on the Twitter, she writes, professional wrestlers that live  past 33 are getting pretty rare, too.  Ah, see?  That's true.  Add that to the extinction list. 
[01:21:00]  That's true.  Did we go 100 days?  I think we might have, finally.  I got to check my list right now.  We went 100 days without a dead wrestler.  Check it twice.  It's been a while.  We're just weaving all over the place.  I love it.  I like this.  I like this.  That's, uh...  Yeah.  I want to talk about the mayor of New York in a second here after we find out about the...  Kim keeping cool?  Yeah.  He N-rigged his fucking Escalade.  He really did.  And they sort of want to say that on the cover.  Yeah. 
[01:21:30]  They say, um, rigs wacky.  Yeah.  You know what they really want to say there.  Yeah.  Wow.  He N-rigged his Escalade to get some AC because, what, his AC is busted in his Escalade?  No.  He actually...  You know what a great environmentalist, our great Her Honor, the mayor is?  Right.  Where he has bike paths because he wants to knock down the emissions and all that and what's not?  She wanted to, uh, have the air conditioning blasting in her vehicle because that's what she likes when they drive her around. 
[01:22:00]  How cold do you need it?  Very cold.  Wait, he doesn't...  The mayor likes it very cold in his vehicle.  Okay.  Her vehicle, I'm sorry.  And they usually keep the vehicle running and keep the air conditioning on when he's doing stuff and waiting to get in the vehicle.  And the emissions of a running vehicle, not good.  Of course.  So they have this thing rigged up where they roll this window unit over to his window and it's got like a gasket type window frame thing around it. 
[01:22:30]  And they roll it in, turn it on, and cool the whole vehicle off before he gets in.  Oh.  Then when he gets in, they start it up, it's cold, and they could go.  So this is all about not keeping his, uh, car running.  He doesn't want his little tushy to hurt when he gets in, um, uh, the hot vehicle.  You know, the upholstery gets a little warm and it's a little stuffy in there.  Does he realize that nowadays, especially if you have a brand new Escalade, you could get your, you could get your car cool within, I would guess, 10 seconds.  He doesn't want it started and running.  No, I mean when you start. 
[01:23:00]  Oh, I know.  But he doesn't want it even to be hot for a second.  We figured out that AC shit.  It looks ridiculous.  They warmed up his, uh, or heated, uh, cooled off his vehicle.  Well, they got a good picture of, uh, this giant window AC unit.  On like a rolly thing.  On a rolly thing that's up, uh, right up against one of his windows.  Yeah, they just roll his air conditioner in there, blast cold air in, he gets in, and off they go to, um.  Must be nice to be rich.  Go see a fucking, uh.  Is it?  I don't know, man.  Share concert or something.  This is rich, Sam. 
[01:23:30]  Oh.  That is rich.  This is fucking rich.  Some fucking guy rolling air conditioner up to your window.  And cool everything off.  Jesus.  Yeah.  What were you looking up?  Uh, wrestler dead.  It's actually been 84 days since Chief J Strongbow died at 83.  I'm a Chief J Strongbow.  So we got, we finally, the bit might end in two weeks.  That's right.  Finally.  In two weeks, the, uh, the, the wrestler dead, dead wrestler fucking, what do we call it?  The wrestler death clock. 
[01:24:00]  Yeah.  Why?  Was it a hundred days?  Is that?  No, we're up to 84.  But is that like what, what the deal is?  We've said we can't go a hundred days.  Oh, okay.  How many years have we been at this now?  Three or four?  Three at least.  Maybe four, yeah.  For at least three years, maybe, uh, closer to four.  We haven't gone a hundred days without a wrestler dying within a hundred days.  Keep yourselves healthy.  16 days and the bit's over.  Yeah.  Wow.  I don't think I'm missing anybody.  Anybody hurting right now?  Wow.  Who's hurting?  Who's, uh.  There's always somebody hurting.  I hear China's hurting.  Oh, China's not in good shape now. 
[01:24:30]  China's hurting.  She was tweeting about a dumb dog or something.  Yeah, China, first of all, like, uh, three weeks ago.  This show is weird today.  Three weeks ago.  Well, not technically, because she's a porno star now.  Right.  Like a legit porno star.  That's true.  But three weeks ago, she was at a porn convention signing, and she kept passing out, because  she was all pilled up, I guess.  Who was she passing out?  Pictures?  No.  Oh.  Oh.  Out of consciousness.  Oh, I get it now.  Oh, see, I miss under.  Uh, so.  And then.  She's fucking falling down. 
[01:25:00]  Yeah.  And, uh, but she still got, she got up and just continued?  No, she had to get rushed to the hospital and everything.  Oh, she did?  Oh, yeah.  Now, did Virgil take her seat?  Yeah.  No.  Virgil had a table outside, I'm sure.  Oh, did he?  Yeah.  On the parking lot?  Can we take another angle on this?  How embarrassed is, uh, Triple H that he had anything to do with China?  Oh, man.  They used to be the wrestling fucking couple.  What about X-Pac?  X-Pac, not so much, because he was already kind of down and dirty, but Triple H is now  like.  What's X-Pac doing? 
[01:25:30]  He's doing, like, uh.  Indie shows?  Yeah, he did a, a convention wearing the one, two, three kid outfit recently.  Oh, wow.  He was huge with this.  Yeah.  He said, suck it.  He was just telling everybody, suck his dick.  Suck it.  Yeah, X-Pac.  Oh, man.  Pack.  Jesus.  Pack or Pack.  Assholes.  X-Pac.  What a collection of dummies.  I'm going to go X-Pac.  X-Pac.  Like Tupac.  X-Pac.  Yeah, that's why I got confused.  I thought there was a pack and a pack.  But yeah, but then China was then on Twitter tweeting that somebody stole her dog and was 
[01:26:00]  tweeting some chick's phone number that she knows, claiming that she had stolen her dog.  Oh, man.  She didn't read these tweets.  They were weird.  And it was like a hundred of them in a row.  Yeah, they were really weird.  Wow.  Wow.  About disrespect and, I don't know, friends don't do this and all sorts of shit.  Yeah.  So you can find a few of them.  And just posting her phone number over and over again.  All right.  So we got 16 days.  We might make it this time, Sam.  Hopefully.  And another one of your bits will be dead.  It's bad time.  Mm-hmm.  Yeah, it really is.  Mm-hmm.  What a tragic bit this was.  So the mayor and his air conditioning and his husband. 
[01:26:30]  We covered that.  Her honor.  I got to bring up something that happened on the Twitter the other day.  Or yesterday, perhaps.  Some guy tweets a video and then writes, hey, Anthony, thought you'd get a kick out of this.  How bad was the video?  So I click on it.  I already know where this is going.  No, no.  It's not just like a bad, stupid video.  It's like, all right, whatever.  You know, it's stupid videos and stuff.  Or that dumb mailbox that looks like a gun. 
[01:27:00]  Or the barbecue that looks like a gun.  I've seen it a thousand times.  The pool.  Or is this your gun closet?  Or, oh, this looks like one of Anthony's pool parties.  All that shit.  They're just trying to relate to you, so they send gun stuff to you.  I know, but so I don't really rag them for that.  I get sunset pictures and you get gun pictures.  But this one was like, it's some girl with Down syndrome.  Singing Baby by Justin Bieber.  And I'm watching it and I'm just thinking, like, what did this guy expect me to do? 
[01:27:30]  Like, I understand the impression we give on this program.  We're sensitive to the tar.  But not everything.  We've said some horrific things on this show because it's the show.  Right.  But not everything.  I don't take all this home.  I take home three things from this program.  My horrific racism.  My horrific sexual deviancy.  And guns.  Well, the booze, too.  And booze.  And booze. 
[01:28:00]  So basically, you take the whole show home with you.  Wow.  Yeah.  But not the retard shit.  And not even booze as much as people think.  I've got to be quite honest with you.  I don't know about that.  It's not as much as people think.  I'll, you know.  We're not buying that.  I'll let you in on a little secret.  We're not buying that anytime soon.  Every night, I'm not pounding down fucking drinks.  Sorry.  How many a night?  But it's true.  Especially, like, within the past fucking year.  It's not even.  Some nights, none. 
[01:28:30]  During the week.  That's impossible.  No, I swear.  One or two.  Swear.  None.  Just fucking.  Who's buying this?  Don't destroy the illusion.  I know.  I know.  I really am blowing it up.  We might have lost a wrestler on June 18th.  Oh, jeez.  We are going to take our second phone call today because we have to verify if this wrestler  is part of our bit.  Let's go to Tom in Jersey.  Tom?  Hey, what's going on, boys?  Hey.  Where you from?  Tom's River?  Tom's River? 
[01:29:00]  I work in Tom's River.  Right.  Who cares?  You don't care.  Way to go with the bit.  Tom, go ahead.  Yeah, thanks.  Way to go.  I killed it.  Trent Acid died 2018 because he was a wrestler, so Sam's wrong.  Trent Acid died years ago, stupid.  How about who the fuck is Trent Acid?  Never heard of him.  Let's start there.  Trent Acid.  Trent Acid died in 2010.  Who was he?  He was a big indie guy who at one point looked like he was going to be the next guy, like 
[01:29:30]  he was very talented.  Indie guy.  But drugs and other things kept him away from the mainstream spotlight.  What year was he big?  He was getting up there in the late 90s.  The answer was, who gives a shit?  Fair enough.  Yeah, that's not a fucking guy that anyone knows or cares about.  No.  Please.  No.  Plus, it was two years ago.  This fucking idiot.  Dummy.  Calling up.  What an asshole.  What a dickhead. 
[01:30:00]  Trying to correct somebody.  Trent Acid.  What a dumb name, too.  It's not a dumb...  I did a promo with him for Jersey All-Pro.  Oh, yeah?  That's right.  You've just been around a ball.  Is it one of the famous videos?  I don't need to see it.  Okay, it's not famous.  You could do it on one of your ten shows.  Okay.  Please.  All right.  Man.  I think we got Mike Baker coming in today.  Yeah, he's coming in.  Coming in and in.  It is a really, really slow news day, which is fine. 
[01:30:30]  But there's nothing worth really talking about.  Oh.  What?  The only sport we really got is baseball.  I just can't get excited about baseball anymore.  You're a Yankees fan, but you're not even really talking about it.  Not really.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I kind of slacked off the season.  The Yankees doing well, right?  Happens.  Yeah.  That's a doing all right.  My old team, who I swear to you I could not name, 
[01:31:00]  the starting lineup of?  The Mets.  Can't do it.  The Miracle Mets?  Don't know it.  Gotta believe?  Don't know.  I'm very far removed at this point.  Wow.  Look at Magic Johnson.  Huh?  Just looks great.  He sucks.  But he looks fantastic.  He's a horrendous analyst if you really want to go deep into sports talk.  Can't talk either.  He's really bad with the rest of the guys.  But it's Magic Johnson, so you got to put him on TV.  HIV my ass. 
[01:31:30]  Look at him.  No shit.  I tweeted, how the fuck does he look better than Larry Bird?  He's connected to Larry Bird for the rest of his life.  They're both, I think Larry Bird turned 55, 56 recently.  I heard that's going extinct.  The Larry Bird?  The Larry Bird.  All right.  Larry Bird looks like shit when you put him next to Magic Johnson.  How is that possible?  HIV.  HIV is killing off the things that kill him.  That's what it's doing.  Really?  He looks great.  You think HIV is so evil that it kills everything else that was going to kill you? 
[01:32:00]  Yeah.  So as long as you can survive the HIV part, you're good?  Then you're golden.  That's a good theory right there.  Yeah.  I kind of like that.  Writing an article for the American Medical Journal on that very hypothesis.  Yeah, but he looks great.  He does.  He's got to be 55 years old.  Man.  All right.  We'll take a break and we'll get Mike Baker in here next.  Sure.  Do some other shit.  Certainly.  Maybe we'll do open phone calls today. 
[01:32:30]  Whoa.  Well, we haven't taken a lot of calls lately, so perhaps.  We could.  Perhaps.  That's because they call up incorrect people and say, oh, this happened.  It was two years ago.  And then someone else calls and goes, the last call was an asshole.  Yeah.  Like, oh, great.  We're going to get into this, huh?  Well, that's kind of fun, though.  Oh, speaking of basketball, a good place to do this.  Amari Stoudemire, remember we talked about that tweet he sent?  It was a DM.  He got mad at somebody and he called someone a fag or a faggot. 
[01:33:00]  Oh, boy.  Did that guy thing that guys just do?  Yeah.  By the way, we just do that?  We don't even mean that we're against gay shit?  No, it has nothing to do with sexuality.  And it was fag.  It was fag?  Yeah.  Well, I don't know, because the update on the article says this.  Excuse me.  Nick star Omari Stoudemire has been fined $50,000 for using what the league termed offensive  and derogatory language in a Twitter message.  And, of course, this stupid article isn't brave enough to say that the word was fag. 
[01:33:30]  Holy shit.  In a Twitter message, NBA disciplinarian Stu Jackson announced Tuesday $50,000 for DMing  someone and telling them to go fuck themselves.  That was his version of go fuck yourself.  That's fucked up right there.  It was a DM.  Private life.  That's kind of your private life.  There is no private life anymore.  It was another incident in a string of unfortunate episodes for Stoudemire.  Stoudemire's role on the team decreased.  His brother died in a car accident, and he needed hand surgery after smashing a glass-enclosed 
[01:34:00]  fire extinguisher after a Game 2 loss in Miami.  Why do they have to add all that?  I don't know.  Responded to a fan with a homosexual slur.  Uh-oh.  After the fan tweeted that the forward needed to step up next season.  Who cares?  Like, what?  I would almost, almost understand if it was on his regular Twitter feed.  It was a DM.  His private shit.  That's private shit.  DMs.  Not anymore.  Nothing's private.  Your emails, texts, everything goes out. 
[01:34:30]  Yeah.  Conversations.  That's too bad.  Everything.  That's too bad.  Why doesn't the NBA just stick up for their players and go, hey, man, unfortunate incident,  but it was a private message from one individual to another.  Oh, boy.  Why not?  It doesn't matter anymore.  There's no privacy.  Did you hear about that fucking, what was it, there was some model on an airplane, and  she was talking to some actor, some C-list actor, and he was trying to pick her up 
[01:35:00]  right here, right?  What?  And she was tweeting his entire conversation.  Now, this guy's a hardcore Christian, married, recovering alcoholic, and she's talking about  how he's drinking beer and went into the bathroom and took off his wedding ring, came  back, trying to pick her up, saying, like, God, it was God's destiny that they were together  on the plane, and the whole time she was just tweeting his conversation, and this guy's 
[01:35:30]  married and recovering, saying he hasn't had a drink, and she said he was hammered off  at three Heinekens.  What happened with this whole thing?  I don't know.  I guess he responded and said it never happened, that she was fibbing about the whole thing.  Why would this model make up all those tweets?  I don't know.  Well, she wound up getting, like, 30,000 followers, though.  Wow.  Nice.  But she did have a seed base of followers there that, you know, maybe she got in some  other way. 
[01:36:00]  A model?  That then was able to, you know, expand.  I mean, if she only had five followers, she wouldn't have gotten up to 30,000, because  no one would have read her tweets about this guy, but, you know.  Is that guy trying to take credit for you?  Perhaps.  Fucking break.  Yes, Kenny.  Oh, Club Soda.  Club Soda, Kenny.  G.H., you said it's a slow news day, but I got a story you might want to discuss.  Oh.  All right, what's the story?  He printed it out. 
[01:36:30]  He's got copies for everybody.  Yeah, maybe after the break.  You didn't have breakfast yet.  Wow, that's a tease.  What's the story about?  Well, very controversial.  I bet he'll get the phones ringing.  Kevin, what is it?  I'll give you a coffee.  Oh.  All right.  Let me see.  Kenny's so mysterious.  Kenny's like a teacher passing out dittos.  Oh, boy.  Really?  Well, okay, we could talk about this. 
[01:37:00]  It'll also lead to the one that pisses me off even more, the woman that's suing the  Little Leaguer.  Sue everyone.  You got that story, Travis?  I do get it.  Could you go get that?  Yeah.  That's enraging.  Yeah, we got stuff to talk about after the break.  Oh, yeah, we do.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, this is a very interesting and entertaining show.  I am.  Today?  I'll say every day.  I'll say.  Today?  Every day, G.H.  Today especially, actually.  Every fucking day. 
[01:37:30]  It's amazing.  It's O&A every day.  That's what I say.  All the way.  What happened to the all the way part?  Sometimes I say that.  Oh, you used to say it all the time.  Yeah.  What was your old saying?  You don't know.  You got a terrific new website, though, you were proud of yesterday.  Kenny sends an email to everyone to brag about his brand new website.  Oh.  It does look terrific, though, Kenny.  My son built it.  He spent long, tedious hours writing the code for that. 
[01:38:00]  Oh, oh, oh.  Would you like to give out your...  Oh, look at that.  Would you like to give out your website?  No, it's professional.  Yeah, this is apart from the club sort of kind of character.  Yeah, this is nonsense.  Okay.  What do you mean?  Oh, what you're doing now is nonsense?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Oh, okay.  I see.  Yeah, yeah.  I never know which one's nonsense and which one is the real shit.  Huh?  Look at the services that you can get.  I like the break-the-knee service that you're offering.  Oh. 
[01:38:30]  Does that second one in entail some type of surveillance, if need be?  Oh, yeah, look.  Covert?  Look at the avatar for it.  Of course that's nice.  Will you go to Arab Nations and...  Yeah, just pay me.  Pay me?  You would go to Arab Nations?  You're a fucking mercenary.  I love it.  Let's do this.  Let's get you a job somewhere else.  That's what Mike Baker does.  Really?  His fucking...  I was saying last night, his Twitter avatar is so kick-ass.  I thought mine was badass with my fucking 50 cal and shit. 
[01:39:00]  But Mike's is fucking crazy.  That's not...  That's like a different one.  It's a chair.  It's not a good one at all.  That's a chair.  You gotta get...  It's a chair with a pad on it.  It's not his fucking...  That's a chair.  Twitter.  What?  It's, uh...  MB Company Man.  Yeah.  What?  MB Company Man.  Well, his Twitter name sucks, though.  Oh, come on.  Company Man.  You know what that means?  Maybe he has a good fucking avatar, but his name sucks.  You know what that means?  MB.  I don't know.  Look at this shit. 
[01:39:30]  Oh, really?  Dude, look.  Really?  Fucking guy.  That's it.  Hold on a little fucking machine gun.  That is pretty cool.  There's Arab writing in the background, so you know he's not anywhere nice.  He's getting into an SUV.  That is pretty cool.  That's badass right there.  And you know that truck's armored up.  Oh, hells yeah.  You think it's a little thick?  Oh, yeah.  You think that glass is a bit thick?  Oh, hell.  Hell, yeah.  How many miles to the gallon, though?  Who cares?  You'd pump it right out of the ground in that savage nation.  You just take your own? 
[01:40:00]  You go with a gas pump hose, right?  And then you just shove it in the ground and pump it into your tank.  It's amazing over there.  Mecca.  Sounds like Mecca.  It's a beautiful place to have a machine gun.  I think I have that gun.  Yeah?  Yeah.  That's an MP5 I think he's holding there.  Wow.  Yeah.  Was he about to fire it off into the air?  Could have only held.  Throw his money on the floor.  Yeah, yeah.  Make it rain.  Make it rain.  Yeah, let me show you.  Let me show you.  Let me show you. 
[01:40:30]  Let me show you.  Let me show you.  All right.  20 times they say the same thing.  You know, I was thinking about yesterday.  You were talking about the World Star Hip Hop videos where they're bragging with their guns  and shit.  Yeah.  And that bothered you a bit?  Well, yeah.  Don't you have a video of you with a massive gun singing karaoke?  Yeah.  Isn't that kind of showboating too?  It is a little showboating.  Going back to Jimmy's point that you guys would get along with these people.  But mine was a goof.  Like mine is singing a love song.  Singing love songs holding giant weaponry is an ironic, goofy thing as opposed to guys 
[01:41:00]  saying they're going to kill people.  I think part of what they do is a goof too, though.  No, it's not.  Because that Rambo guy with the Rambo necklace that we saw yesterday, remember him?  He's dead.  How do you know?  Somebody sent me a link to one of the videos that was a tribute to him.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  Aw.  Come on.  You're holding a 200-pound gun.  Singing karaoke.  That is... 
[01:41:30]  They could take your video, sir, and make fun of them.  Well, this is obviously on O-P-A-N-T-X-M Twitter, YouTube.  And see, I'm singing a wonderful Cat Stevens love song.  With a massive gun.  Well, it is a Barrett .50 cow.  It's very heavy.  But don't you think they could take that video and twist it and make you look like a...  This is...  I was supposed to look crazy.  But that's the point.  I think some of those guys are trying to look crazy.  No, they're not. 
[01:42:00]  Not the same?  No.  You sure?  No.  They are crazy.  That's kind of crazy right there.  Because it looks...  That's kind of crazy.  It looks silly.  Kind of crazy.  Why would a guy be singing this peaceful, lovey-dovey song if...  You know...  But why would a guy make it rain on his fellow friend there?  Because he's showing off.  I'm not showing off.  You're not showing off.  No.  That's showing off.  No, I'm doing a goofy video.  You couldn't figure out how to show off that awesome gun.  No, I show it off shooting. 
[01:42:30]  I've posted videos of the range.  But that's more showing off right there.  I posted videos of the range.  No, this is just silly.  It's ironic.  It's a thing that you can't put together.  Like, why is he singing this?  Look how giant that gun is.  And why is he...  With your biceps.  You're like...  Oh, I was straining.  Yeah.  Your biceps are working right there.  Imagine having to be a poor bastard that's got to tote that around all day.  No wonder they just place it down and start firing at people's heads from a mile away.  I don't want to tote that fucking thing. 
[01:43:00]  You think it gets to a point?  All right.  Good enough.  I'm just going to sit here and look through this scope and wait until I see someone blow  their head off because...  I'm not carrying this for another quarter mile.  Fuck that.  I'm not going to be toting this.  Fuck that.  It is a good video.  I love this song.  But it might be a bit of showboarding like the homies do.  I don't know.  Because the video would have been nice if you were just singing a little Cat Stevens.  I know.  But I wanted to make it a little weird and different. 
[01:43:30]  Like, why is he doing that?  And it wound up making one of those fucking TV shows about wacky videos.  Yeah.  You fucking popped it on right there, motherfucker.  It served its purpose, but I think it's very similar to some of the stuff we were watching yesterday.  I don't think you could really equate it to the homeboys.  First of all, that rifle has all the proper documentation and all the proper hoops that I jumped through to get it. 
[01:44:00]  Do you need a permit to sing with it?  No.  Oh.  No permit to sing with a gun.  It's amazing.  Was it loaded?  No.  If you see, there is no magazine in there.  And the bolt is pulled back.  Opened.  Breach.  So you should have loaded it.  And my finger is not on the trigger.  Why would I load it?  That's crazy.  For the gun enthusiasts out there, they would have went, holy shit, not only is he holding this fucking thing, it is loaded because I know that shit.  That would be crazy. 
[01:44:30]  And then you unload after the song's over.  No.  Unload into the fucking wall.  It goes out and goes through five more houses.  Would it?  Oh, fuck yeah.  The thing would go.  No.  Not five, but it would fucking definitely go through my wall.  How many walls would it go through?  I would say it would go through my wall into another house.  And barring what it hits in the house, through the other wall and out the other house.  No.  And perhaps stick in the next house's wall.  Really?  Yes.  If it had a clear, like, clear ceiling?  Absolutely.  Yeah, yeah, yeah. 
[01:45:00]  It would be crazy.  What kind of wall, though?  Solid steel.  Oh, whoa.  No.  You know, sheetrock, wood.  Plywood, sheetrock.  What about brick?  Fucking, uh, no, brick, uh, no, let's be real here.  Brick does tend to, um...  Wow.  ...absorb some energy.  Wow.  Oh, crazy gun guy was Penn Jillette's idea.  Why aren't you giving him credit today?  Jimmy James remembers.  Did he say that?  I think he might have.  Was it Penn?  He gave the idea.  And he gave credit to Louis Black and Ron Bennington in the video description. 
[01:45:30]  I thought it was Colin Quinn, too.  It was Penn.  Oh, it was, uh...  I think it was Penn Jillette.  Penn?  Why did Penn say that?  I kind of remember that.  I don't remember that.  I kind of remember that.  See, his videos of actual shooting it.  See?  Now, that's normal.  I'm at a sanctioned range.  You're on a picnic table.  That's a picnic table.  It's a shooting station.  That's a picnic table.  Shooting station.  Picnic table.  Shooting station.  Picnic.  Shooting table.  Station.  Shooting station.  You're a fucking brown noser.  I thought you were going to say picnic table after that. 
[01:46:00]  And then I would have gotten you.  No, you're a brown noser.  Bugs Bunny.  Oh, you went Bugs Bunny?  I was trying to grab him.  I was trying to get him for him.  Yeah, I was smart, I guess.  Listen, when we get back, we're going to do the Club Soda Kenny story.  We're going to do the story of the asshole lady who's suing a Little Leaguer.  Ah.  Do you know this story?  Yes.  I heard this.  I heard tell of this.  And we're also going to talk to Mike Baker about his avatar photo.  So, yes, I want to know where that was taken. 
[01:46:30]  Yeah.  Mike's a fun guy, though.  I've done red eye with him when he's taken over Andy Levy's job.  And he does a great job.  He does, right?  Yeah.  Wherever they put that, wherever they put the guy that sits there and comes in halfway through  the show and bashes you on what you said for the first half of the show.  It's a good bit.  Oh, it's great.  I'm doing red eye on the 12th of July.  I will be on red eye again. 
[01:47:00]  A few people agreeing that you might have been a bit hypocritical.  About what?  Now that I pointed out the big gun karaoke video.  I'm not fucking going around waving my guns in public, first of all.  Some are saying that it's closer than you'd like to think.  No, it's not.  I'm not outside in public waving my guns in the AL like I just don't care, first of all.  And it's a legal gun.  They're saying it's a bit close.  It's not loaded.  It has nothing to do. 
[01:47:30]  Just for the fact that I'm holding a gun.  That's as close as it gets.  It's a little close.  That's as close as it gets.  A bit of showboating.  I'm not fucking yelling into the camera lens about who I'm going to shoot.  I'm not doing that.  They're always doing that.  And you got a few gun karaoke videos.  Yeah, there's a couple.  I had different weapons I wanted to showcase in my videos.  It's a bit close.  It's not even close.  Ain't even a motherfucking ballpark. 
[01:48:00]  But then again, I can't trust this guy's tweet because he spelled hypocrite wrong.  That is a tough word, man.  Even spellcheck sometimes goes, I don't know what you're trying to spell.  Hippopotamus?  Good luck with that one.  Hippocratic Oath?  Right.  I fucking hate spellcheck.  I kind of like spellcheck.  I hate when it's spellchecks when you're not even, it guesses the word for you.  Dude, that's why, like I said, you got to put your shortcuts in and spell out the word  that you want to spell.  Because every time, I use NP for no problem all the time. 
[01:48:30]  Right.  And it always turns it into no, N-O.  Right.  So I put a shortcut in and I put, whenever I type NP, I want it to be NP.  Yeah, I gotcha.  And then you know what happens?  NP.  You got the NP now.  Right.  I hate when you see it, it looks right.  And then you go back down to the fucking typing thing.  Oh, man.  Yeah.  Typing.  That's a word we shouldn't use.  Typing.  And then all of a sudden you send it and then you check it on your fucking feed and go,  what the fuck happened?  Now I look like an idiot.  What happened to the translation? 
[01:49:00]  Exactly.  I saw the word I wanted.  I typed in all curse words, by the way, too, in the shortcuts.  Fuck.  Shit.  Piss.  Oh, nice.  Cunt.  All that stuff.  So that way, when I type it in, it doesn't try to change it to something else.  And they do.  It's brilliant.  What do they do with fuck?  They don't want you to type fuck.  I forget.  Flock is one.  Wait a minute.  No, no.  I forget what it becomes.  I want to.  Uh, shit.  Eh, whatever.  Fick, flick, flick.  Because it's something.  We could talk about that.  And shit always comes out as shot. 
[01:49:30]  Shot.  That one.  Maybe that's the one I'm thinking of.  Shot.  Oh.  How many times I've typed, I want to fuck the shot out of you?  It's embarrassing.  And your sex thing.  We got a chip bit going to break.  What's that?  Uh, Jimmy will be back, uh, I think in August at this point.  When is he coming back?  He's gone the rest of the week?  Yeah.  That was fucking, I was listening to part of the replay with Jimmy yesterday, uh, when  I had a horrible chip joke.  And he goes, home run, Kumiya. 
[01:50:00]  It's so fucking funny.  I'm praying that doesn't catch on us.  Home run.  I'm praying.  Double gun.  I actually prayed to my Lord Jesus Christ last night.  It's just too goddamn funny.  Here's Chip doing a mafia thing.  Or the guys took Chip and made it into a mafia thing.  Well, this is an interrogation.  Yeah.  Uh, uh, of self-professed mafia hitman, little Chippy D.  Oh, Chippy D.  Mike Baker next.  The date is October 11th, 1983.  It's 7.18 p.m. 
[01:50:30]  Detective Club Soda with self-professed organized crime soldier Lyle Chipperson.  Okay, Lyle, you're requesting placement in witness protection.  What kind of information do you have for us?  Yo, I'm in a mafia.  Don't even fuck around with me.  Don't get defensive.  Just explain your business here.  I was in the mafia for years.  My mob name was little Chippy D.  Okay, Lyle, you have no record.  You've been seen with none of our organized crime contacts. 
[01:51:00]  What was your role?  The hitman.  A hitman?  Mafia hitman.  Right, the mafia.  Well, who do you work most closely with?  I ain't no rat.  Then I don't know why you're here.  Are you afraid of repercussions?  See, good luck killing me.  I carry like fucking bazookas.  Lyle, there's no way you could have carried around a weapon like that.  If you're just here to waste my time, I suggest you leave.  Fuck you, cocksucker.  I'd shoot and kill everybody.  Bury in a hole or something.  Then we'll see. 
[01:51:30]  Mr. Chipperson, why are you here?  Fucking stupid cocksucker.  Start listening, you fucking piece of shit.  I can't believe you wasted our fucking time with this bullshit.  Do you know this is a crime?  Make him an offer that no one refuses.  Why don't you do yourself a favor, Lyle?  Walk out the door now.  Fuck you.  You're a funny guy.  Laugh at this.  You like that?  How does this feel?  Fuck this.  Serious, Serious, XM's. 
[01:52:00]  The O.P. and Anthony's Show.  I want to say hi to Mike Baker, joining the program. 
[01:52:30]  Mike.  Hi.  What's up, Mikey?  Hi.  Welcome to Mike.  Thank you very much for having me, guys.  I love this show.  You know that.  This is the best radio show out there.  Thank you, sir.  No one comes close.  No one, Sam.  No one.  I like doing red-eye with Mike, too.  Mike's fun to have on red-eye.  Is he?  When you take over.  I'm a fun guy.  When you take over that Andy Levy spot, it's just hilarious with your charts and graphs  and whatnot.  I do all that just because I can't be bothered to listen to the show.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Andy listens to what everybody says, and then halfway through the show, he does his mid-the-half-time 
[01:53:00]  half-time report.  Yeah.  And Mike's just kind of like, I don't know what anybody's been talking about, so I'll  just hold up some charts and graphs.  Do you sit there praying that Andy Levy didn't notice your faux pas or your little fumble  or whatever the hell it would be that night?  That fucking guy notices everything.  And you sit there and go, oh, shit.  Pain in the ass he is.  Yeah.  I don't know how he does it.  It's a tough job because you really do have to pay attention.  It's very smart and clever.  It's a very clever bit.  Yeah.  You've got to pay attention and think on the fly like that and not miss anything while 
[01:53:30]  you're thinking and writing down what you want to talk about.  So, yeah, he does a great job at that.  You've got an example of the halftime report for the people that don't know red-eye?  Oh.  And this was from when?  April.  April?  Last year.  Oh, wow.  Jesus.  Nothing interesting has happened since then.  What the hell?  Way to go, Sam.  Nice one, Sam.  Is this the only one they have up on the internet?  This is a commercial that comes up.  Oh.  Maybe it's especially good. 
[01:54:00]  Welcome back.  Let's find out if we've got anything wrong.  Oh, my God.  For that, we'll do some more Baker.  So, Mike, how are things going?  To find out if we've got anything wrong so far, you're coming to me?  Yes.  How many years have we known each other?  Too long, my friend.  But I still keep the faith that maybe one day you'll approach this job with a modicum  of respect and responsibility that we often find in other people.  Yeah, who do this.  I know a lot of people pay attention.  Yeah.  I know.  Do you actually just drift off during while we're doing the show? 
[01:54:30]  You just drift off.  What a prime example this is.  Yes, it is.  I've been traveling a lot lately.  I got a lot going on.  That is pretty good, though.  They got diligence up there.  So, look, first, let's go to where we stand in the charts in terms of correct answers,  incorrect answers, and questionable answers.  I'm pleased to say that Brooke is clearly in the lead on this with an astounding number  of correct answers.  You literally sit there and draw these things up.  Once again, proving that high women are sure to get the lead on my where we stand polls 
[01:55:00]  any time.  Then followed in by Terry.  There you go.  You might notice the hot chicks with big boobs always come out on top.  Of course.  Of course they do.  And they should be on top.  And I was tweeting, actually, your badass avatar for your Twitter account.  So, what's the story behind this picture right here? 
[01:55:30]  Well, can you explain the picture again before?  Oh, my God.  Mike is standing outside an SUV.  Yeah.  I see some kind of banner behind the SUV that has that writing on it that means I'm somewhere  that might be dangerous.  It's that Arabic writing.  And I believe you're holding an MP5.  Yes, it is an MP5.  A fine, mobile weapon.  Nice.  Small.  Yeah.  Yet very effective.  It packs a lot of volume.  Is that the 9mm? 
[01:56:00]  Yes, it is.  And it's good for on the go.  So, kids, if you're listening and you're wondering what to take with you in the parent's car,  in case you come across any trouble, take an MP5.  MP5.  You can stash a lot of extra ammo in your pockets, and it's good to go.  Oh, but that was overseas.  Yeah, it was overseas.  That was the Arabic writing.  Actually, someone sent me a note saying, is that Detroit?  I think that's Dearborn.  You won't tell us what country, though, huh?  No, no. 
[01:56:30]  Oh.  But it is over there.  Can you read that Arabic writing in the background?  Yeah, it says, Mike Baker is a douchebag.  Welcome, Mike Baker, a douchebag.  Maybe it's advertising for a sub shop or something.  Why do you always have to think it's something really bad?  That's funny.  I never realized that.  It could just say grand opening or come on in.  Or, you know, grandma's 85th birthday celebration is here.  I always think it's death to the infidel.  Exactly.  I think what it actually says is diligence for all your information and security needs. 
[01:57:00]  Oh.  It might be a congratulations banner.  Maybe someone, I don't know, graduated high school or something.  What's wrong with you?  Welcome, Farouk.  MP5 mags available here.  That's right.  That's right.  Farouk's MP5 warehouse.  Maybe they're selling fruit on the side of the highway.  It's wrong when you ask.  It could always be something else.  That's true.  You know, we did paint it with a big broad brush, didn't we?  And that's not right.  You did.  That's not right.  How long ago was that about?  It was about a little while back.  About a little while back. 
[01:57:30]  These ex-CIA guys, they just don't give up nothing.  Not to give it up.  No.  We're not like the White House.  We don't just give away shit for free.  I was going to say, that must annoy the hell out of you when you see these leaks and stuff.  And you're like, boy, these guys aren't team players.  Yeah.  Thank you for giving me that opening.  I got a pretty good friend, and we're convinced he's CIA.  And we want to know if he's CIA.  And he won't budge.  Well, I'm not going to tell you.  But all of a sudden, they'll go, oh, I'm in Australia playing hockey for the national team. 
[01:58:00]  I'm like, but you're stationed in Dubai, and you have a job.  How are you able to just do that?  We hardly ever used hockey as a cover.  But it's actually not bad, because you carry those big kit bags around.  But how is he able to leave his job?  Yeah.  No, it's a good question.  For a while.  And he's like, hey, I'm over here.  I'm like, what about your job?  Oh, no, they understand.  And now he's in Manhattan this week.  With hockey?  And then he was skiing in the Alps. 
[01:58:30]  Yeah.  What does he supposedly do?  Security.  Security.  Okay.  Well, I mean, no.  You never know.  If he's got a secret Dakota ring, then that's the giveaway, usually.  How about this?  I take a train from Philly back to New York with the guy.  He goes up to the ticket booth, and they said hi and said his name.  That's odd, unless they had his ticket with his name on it.  Yeah, right?  I don't know.  It's no big.  How does he know?  No, he didn't hand over a ticket.  Oh, he did. 
[01:59:00]  We walked up to the booth.  And they knew who he was.  And I go, wait, they know who you are.  And he just laughed it off like, I normally don't put much cream about it.  I normally don't put much credence in Opie's wild, paranoid delusions.  Right.  But this sounds like something.  Yeah.  How can you leave a job and just go skiing in the Alps for a little bit?  Or play hockey.  And then go hockey in Australia and then come to Manhattan?  Does he independently wealthy?  Does he have a lot of money?  I don't know.  I mean, he doesn't have a...  Maybe he's a merc. 
[01:59:30]  Like, we don't know how to get a hold of him.  It's starting to sound more and more suspicious.  He calls us.  Yeah.  He might actually be involved in narcotics.  Drug dealer.  Right, right.  He calls us.  Not even dealer.  Drug fucking kingpin.  He's had many, many different cell phone numbers.  Yeah.  Usually, I'll tell you, here's the thing.  Usually, when you're working for the outfit, you don't create that bizarreness around you.  Because all you want to do is blend in, right?  So, normally, anybody who is behaving oddly or has lots of mystery surrounding them, you know, they're not in the company because you don't want to be noticed. 
[02:00:00]  That's not your point of view.  He's a West Point guy.  He's a West Point guy.  Well, you know, that's good.  You can't argue with that.  That's great.  Oh, okay.  But thank you for mentioning the Intel leaks, if you don't mind, because you just stuck a pin in my ass because that's the thing that I've been banging on about now for the past couple of months.  If you don't mind me just taking about four hours to talk about this.  What happened?  This is one leaky administration.  Yeah, it's incredibly damaging. 
[02:00:30]  But the problem is that, you know, everybody gets distracted about it for about five minutes, right?  And they all get outraged.  And there's lots of outrage on Capitol Hill.  And then everybody moves on to the next fucking thing because they just can't be bothered.  And so, you know, they talk about this investigation that they're doing.  And yet we dismiss it.  We dismiss it because we have this culture of leaks now.  And it's okay.  It didn't used to be okay to open your app and reveal any of this.  Anybody who handles classified information, whether you're in the White House as a political appointee or whether you're, you know, in the intel community, military, whatever it is, you're signing up to agreements. 
[02:01:00]  And they're very serious agreements saying you're going to handle this responsibility, you know, with, you know, your life.  And we've gotten away from that.  It's okay to do that.  You know, the New York Times can write a story that's based on nothing but anonymous sources.  Yeah.  So, I mean, if we all think back, there was one of the first things that happened was we had this new underwear bomber, right?  And this is the one that really set a lot of us off who worry about national security and operations. 
[02:01:30]  And, you know, the fact that the White House, by saying, look, this was not a dangerous issue because we were on top of this, you know, since April, basically throwing a recruited asset under the bus.  You don't have to be Lex Luthor and Al Qaeda to understand that, well, wait a minute, if they knew what was going on here for the past couple of months, that means they've got a source here.  And so we had – and that's, in fact, what happened.  We had a penetration.  We had a source inside Al Qaeda in the Raven Peninsula. 
[02:02:00]  And you can imagine, and everyone listening can imagine, that's not an easy thing to do.  And it wasn't our operation.  It was a liaison service and one of our allies, and they were good enough to bring us in on this.  And so there were several different services working on this operation.  And the goal of this was not just to put somebody in there so he could get his hands on the new form of underwear bomb and run it over to the FBI for forensic accounting.  We were gathering a variety of critical operational actionable intelligence pieces, you know, individuals involved in Al Qaeda, safe house locations, communication systems, finances, you know, all that shit that you need to take out these targets. 
[02:02:30]  And somehow the White House and the media just acted like, eh, it's no big fucking deal, that we then coughed this guy up.  And what happens when you do that?  As soon as they understood that safe houses are shut down, bank accounts are dried up, people go to ground.  You're not going to find them again.  All that work now.  All that work.  Gone.  Right.  And so that is why what we should be doing – and we could solve this problem without millions of dollars in, you know, a major investigation like they're going through right now. 
[02:03:00]  So it's a short list of people who are given access to these operations, particularly the sensitivity of something like that, right?  Short list of people.  You walk up to those people, whether in the White House or on Capitol Hill, and you know who they are, you know, for the most part.  Maybe somebody was talking to an attorney and you're not aware that they, you know, told their girlfriend about the operation.  But you know the people that are on the list, and you ask them to submit to a polygraph.  And if they refuse, then you yank their fucking clearances.  Wow.  Yeah.  And then you don't allow them access to information anymore.  You put them on the sidelines, and then you consider them as prime candidates for the investigation. 
[02:03:30]  And I guarantee you we would find either the people responsible, and then we treat them accordingly.  I don't understand why this is so damn difficult.  What was their reasoning for coughing that up to the press?  And is it just for bragging rights?  Like, hey, we were on top of this.  Look how great we are.  Yeah.  I don't know.  I don't have a dog in the hunt, necessarily, in terms of why it was done.  I don't give a shit why it was done. 
[02:04:00]  But I understand your question.  A lot of people think it was done because it makes the Obama administration look good and tough and, you know, all G.I. Joe-ish.  And fine.  You know, maybe that's the reason.  Maybe it's because, you know, some people just, it blows their skirt up to talk to reporters.  Even though they're being described as anonymous.  I don't understand.  Yeah.  Do you jerk off when you're reading a newspaper the next morning and you're listed as anonymous in the front page story and you think that's exciting?  That's fucked up.  I don't get it.  People do just love some kind of public eye thing.  They love being in this, like, even if they are anonymous, they could tell their friends, you know, hey, by the way, that was me. 
[02:04:30]  I knew that.  People get their rocks off, not in the intel community, but when they get access to information that other people don't have, that excites, you know, some folks and they like to show that because in Washington, D.C., you know, your information and your access is power.  You might be carrying the bags of a senator or the vice president, you know, and be the gopher, but because you're there all the time, that gives you prestige in Washington. 
[02:05:00]  It's a pretty fucked up society there.  And then access to information, and that's a little bit more true everywhere, but in Washington it's really true.  So I think there's an element of that they'd just like to show, but the bottom line is if we just go after and show some seriousness, and I don't care whether it's this administration, previous administration, any, go after whomever does it and make sure that you make an example of them so that we stop this culture where it's okay to do it.  And that's now I'm climbing off my soapbox.  No, but it's a huge, huge issue, a huge, yeah, huge story. 
[02:05:30]  I don't understand.  I don't know how so many people these days are getting all this intel.  Why is it open to so many people?  I mean.  Yeah, that's a great question.  Is it because it's easier to communicate these days?  I think that's part of it.  I think it's.  Because we were talking about the old days when you had to, you know, we started.  How to write letters.  Yeah, we started the show talking about how you had to write letters and wait for the response, and now it's all instant.  So maybe that has something to do with it. 
[02:06:00]  Yeah, it'd be nice to go back to the whole letter writing thing.  Every now and then I get, you know, I think, I'm going to sit down and write a letter.  That goes.  I get the first paragraph out, you know.  We've been all over the place today, but the other day I picked up a pen to do a little writing, and I realized I can't write anymore.  I can sign my name in script, and that's it.  Have you tried writing in cursive?  That's what I'm, I can't do it anymore, because that part of my brain's done, you know, dead.  Yeah, I heard that they're going to stop teaching it in school. 
[02:06:30]  Are they?  So they decided they don't need to teach kids how to write in cursive anymore.  I can't.  It's like calligraphy now.  It's just dated.  It's going to be an art form.  Pretty soon they won't teach how to do a haiku.  Yeah.  What the fuck?  Look, I wrote your name, just all block letters.  Yeah.  I use all capital letters.  Yeah.  Yeah, you don't spell Mike with a Y, but that's okay.  Fuck you.  But it's all capital letters, but if it has to be a capital letter, then the capital letter  is bigger than the other capital letters, and that's how I write.  No, I know.  I tried script the other day, and I'm like, holy fuck, I can't do it. 
[02:07:00]  I mean, who, really?  Who does write in cursive anymore?  I can't even write my first name, so I just fucking sign things with my last name.  It's easier.  They have on the computer now, you can sign it.  You actually draw your signature using the cursor.  So now you don't even have to print something off and actually sign your name because they  assume you're so stupid, and they're right.  We are.  We can't do it anymore.  Well, you can e-sign now.  Yeah, right.  Where you just type out your name, and then it decides what it's supposed to look like 
[02:07:30]  in script.  But I think that's what it is.  I think the flow of information is much easier now.  It used to be, in the old days, you'd have a secret, right?  It'd be on a piece of paper, and it'd be marked classified, and there'd be a big red stripe  through it, and then you'd put it in an envelope, and then you'd say, you know, son, I need  you to carry this down to floor number five, and knock on the door, and I need you to hand  it to Ted.  And he was going to then deliver it to the Pentagon.  And remember, yeah, yeah.  Remember it had the list of people that have seen?  Right.  Holy fuck, you remember?  That's something we haven't thought about. 
[02:08:00]  Those envelopes, the manila envelopes.  Right.  Routing slips.  But it was right on the envelope.  Like, okay, and you could see who else has seen this particular document inside.  Those were pretty handy.  Now that we've got all these intel leaks, you'd think, that was a pretty handy little  system, because that would make this thing all very simple.  Because now you know it's one of these fucking guys.  You know what?  But we have that list.  We're just not.  We don't.  Nobody has, apparently, nobody has the balls in Washington to just do this.  And I've been banging on about this polygraph thing, because you can't force them to.  I mean, in the agency, you do. 
[02:08:30]  You either take your polygraphs or you leave.  But in, you know, political appointees and others roaming around the White House, you  can't force them.  But you can request they submit.  And if they say no, then, like I said, pull their damn clearances and move them on out  of there.  They can go get a real job.  Do you think, like we're talking about the envelopes and papers going back and forth,  and I know there's been a lot of, there's got to be a lot of places where you can't have  a phone and a camera in very secured areas. 
[02:09:00]  But there's got to be these other gray areas where there's still sensitive information,  but people are allowed to just carry their phones around.  This gives everyone cameras to just, if you see something you deem interesting, you can  take a picture of it, which was unheard of.  You used to have to sneak a camera in to do it.  That was espionage.  Now it's just, I have a phone, and this seems like something that would be interesting to  show my friends.  Yeah.  And in the old days, and that's right, document photography.  You know, if you had an asset, say, in Russia, and you had to get them, you'd say, okay, I 
[02:09:30]  need you to photograph some documents.  Well, that was a massive operation all by itself, to find the ability to get that asset,  you know, squirreled away somewhere to teach them how to use, you know, a document camera  that then they could, you know, secrete, you know, in their bunghole or whatever, carry  it back in the country and then do this thing.  That was a massive operation all by itself.  And you're right.  Now everybody, everybody.  Everyone has a camera.  Now, you can't go into headquarters, obviously, with your phone, with your camera.  And so there are, yes, there are highly secure environments. 
[02:10:00]  Then there are others, as you pointed out, where classified information floats around  and it's a little bit gray.  And that's where, that's again, you know, that's where we got a problem.  But we don't have a problem if we treat it seriously and we go after the situation.  But because we don't, everyone just assumes it's okay.  And we keep having these problems.  And we have this very dismissive nature.  You remember the 10 Russian spies that were kicked out of the country.  The one with the broad?  That's the one.  That's what I'm talking about.  The story became the hot one. 
[02:10:30]  Right.  That became the story.  That was the story.  Everybody said, oh my God, she's so hot.  Look at her.  But look at that.  Well, this can't be serious.  The Russians, the point about that story was that it can drive you crazy is that the Russians  had these individuals over here.  And these guys were now rocket scientists.  And their only job was to just exist.  And maybe they'll bump into somebody of interest.  That was it.  That's their own.  They're a spotter.  And then if they bump into somebody of interest, then they hand them off to somebody who's got a  little bit more responsibility to kind of assess and look at.  And then if they and then they had the perfect person hands it over to somebody who's even 
[02:11:00]  more advanced to develop that individual as a potential source.  So the Russians put all this money, time and effort into just people roaming around.  And we act like, ah, look, she's hot.  And we act like it doesn't fucking matter.  It's like the Chinese stealing all our secrets, you know, through cyber attacks.  Yeah.  And we act like, yeah, what the hell, you know, and it's the same thing with the Intel  leaks.  We've just gotten to this point where if we just take these people out back and beat  them with a two by four, maybe people would take it seriously. 
[02:11:30]  We're very dismissive.  Like you said, these days, we like the cause du jour, the, you know, whatever's on the  news that day that's exciting, interesting.  And then it just goes away.  We don't, we don't see follow-up stories anymore.  There used to be, remember a follow-up to a story we reported to you a month ago that  just doesn't happen anymore because, because they're like, no one cares. 
[02:12:00]  We're onto the new thing.  Right.  So no one really takes anything seriously anymore.  We don't care about the bus monitor lady anymore.  Who?  Exactly.  What about the causes?  Like Coney.  Remember the Coney cause?  I don't even know what that is.  Even the Trayvon story, that's all right, whatever.  Yeah, we said, we said, we sent SF out to Africa, to hunt down Coney.  And that was like, oh my God, for two days, that was what the, what the hell?  This is a huge story.  I really care about this.  Yeah.  And then, but the, but the White House and, and, and, you know, not just this one, any  White House, any politician understands that cycle and they understand if they can just 
[02:12:30]  get you looking over here, you're going to forget about this thing.  Right.  That could have brought them down.  So you really believe they play the media, huh?  Absolutely.  Yeah.  Absolutely.  Amazingly well, too.  By the way, a cursive not being taught in, in the schools in Columbus, Ohio already.  Look at that.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  I think we were breaking that story.  So we wasted.  Yeah.  The story we reported a month ago.  Well, there's a lot of stuff we had to learn in school growing up that we, we know is a 
[02:13:00]  waste of time.  Yeah.  Computer languages.  You know how many courses I took in computer languages?  And that's, that's nonsense.  Did you do the punch cards?  We were around when they were doing punch cards or?  I don't, I don't know.  No, to be honest with you.  Okay.  I think I just missed that.  I'm just, I'm, I'm just old enough that the one, I only took one computer course.  I remember punch cards.  Yeah.  They were unbelievable.  And I took one computer course.  And I remember being in the lab for about four hours one night.  I didn't understand it.  I'm not that bright.  I didn't understand what the hell was going on.  And so I came up with a stack because you had to have the stack of punch cards by the time 
[02:13:30]  you finished your little, whatever that you were doing.  And that stack of punch cards would basically add two numbers together and tell you that  it equaled four, right?  Right.  After all that effort.  So I'm thinking, I don't understand this bullshit.  I got my big stack of punch cards.  They're all in order.  I start to walk out and it's those swinging double doors, right?  So someone walks in as I'm ready to walk out.  I'm not paying attention.  I'm talking to somebody over here.  Knocks every single one of those damn punch cards out there spread all over the floor.  And this was my one epiphany.  I looked down at those punch cards.  I looked at the guy I was talking to.  I said, these fucking computers aren't going anywhere. 
[02:14:00]  I'm out of this shit.  And then I withdrew from the class and that was the last of it.  These computers aren't going anywhere.  That was brilliant.  I got a minor in computers.  It was a waste of time.  All the languages are pretty much extinct that I took.  I never understood the language concept.  Pascal and I'm trying to remember.  Fortran.  I remember basic.  Advanced basic.  When I first got a Commodore 64 computer, I had a book where you could program your own games. 
[02:14:30]  And I sat there.  Which was fun to do, to be honest with you.  It was hours.  I liked it, though.  But it was hours of tedious coding and numbers and then checking for syntax errors and debugging  for something that, if it did work, it was the cheesiest, most archaic, boring game ever.  And it would usually cut out halfway through because you fucked something up.  But you would go, holy shit, I made this.  That was kind of a cool feeling.  I was trying 12,050.  I forgot an if-then. 
[02:15:00]  But that's a good point because you were building something.  And now I got three little boys under the age of five.  And two of them are incredibly intuitive with the iPhone games and the other things.  And they just sit and play whatever Angry Birds for hours on end because I don't pay any  attention to them.  No, I do.  I pay a lot of attention to them.  But they still like to play Angry Birds.  And they're not building anything or they're not creating anything.  You lost me when you said three kids under five years old.  Yeah.  And I got one just turned five, one's almost three, and one's almost a year.  He was busy. 
[02:15:30]  Wow.  Me and Larry King.  Wow.  Yeah.  What do you think?  Do you want to be responsible for kids when they don't put you on certain missions when  you've got kids?  I'm not thinking he's too old for kids.  I'm thinking movies.  Although I'll tell you a funny story because I got a daughter who was just getting ready  to go to college.  She just got out of high school.  That's from a previous marriage.  And so when she was little, I got in some trouble for this.  But when she was tiny, when she was a baby, we had an operation going on overseas. 
[02:16:00]  And we had tracked a terrorist support cell.  And we had identified the individuals coming into that country through the ports to meet  up with some of these cell members.  And so we were running this fairly involved operation.  We had a lot of surveillance assets.  We had a lot of things going on.  But we said, OK, now, part of the problem is, though, getting up close.  And we didn't have a good description of this person.  And we had a little trigger, but we didn't have much.  And so there are a lot of people in this port, a lot of people. 
[02:16:30]  And so we thought, how are we going to do this?  How are we going to put somebody there?  Because you've got to have cover for action, right?  You've got to have some reason to explain yourself.  You know, if you're doing long-term surveillance in a place like that where there's a lot of  issues and you don't necessarily blend, people have to be able to look at you and say,  OK, I understand why they're there.  That's a construction worker.  That's a police officer.  They look at you and they immediately say, I know why that person's there.  That's a circus clown.  That's a circus clown.  Not good.  Yeah, that's right.  Exactly.  Well, it could be.  Why is he juggling?  That's true.  Why is he juggling on the dogs? 
[02:17:00]  Cirque du Soleil surveillance.  Right.  But so I hit on this idea.  I said, you know what?  I can get my ex-wife and take my baby out there and with a couple of, you know, just  suitcases.  And she could sit there waiting for a ferry boat and could just be sitting there for hours,  right?  In the hot sun waiting for this ferry boat.  And my ex-wife is very switched on.  She's a very smart person.  And so I knew, you know, that part of it wasn't problem.  So I said, okay, we'll take the baby and we'll put the baby out there in a little stroller,  you know, or a little pram next to you. 
[02:17:30]  And you just sit and that way we got somebody right up next to where this thing was coming  in.  And it worked like a charm.  And then people found out I'd used a, you know, a two-month-old baby as a surveillance  asset.  But it worked.  It worked.  See?  That's as bad as when Michael Jackson hung his kid out the window.  You know that, right?  I'm a father.  That's fucked up, Mike Baker.  No, it's not.  It's because, you know, we had a lot of assets around the area.  Nothing bad was going to happen unless we wanted it to.  Gave the kid a gun, too.  That's what I'm saying.  The kid had an MP5.  Right.  Just in case. 
[02:18:00]  A little cut down version.  Right there in the stroller.  No, my point, getting back to it, three kids under the age of five, not the, you know,  you're not too old to, you know, have kids.  But three, I can't imagine three under five.  Is it crazy?  Yeah.  Five, three, and one.  I mean, the good news is my wife, who's wonderful now, she's older than my daughter, so it's  all in the up and up.  And she's got a tremendous amount of energy.  But you're right.  There are times when you think, wow, you know, you see why you have kids when you're young.  I got a support group, you know. 
[02:18:30]  It's Larry, Tony Randall, and he's dead, isn't he?  Yeah, yeah, that guy.  Old dads with young kids.  We meet every Tuesday.  I can join the group, sir.  I can join the group.  I love it, though.  It is great.  It is.  It's the best.  I absolutely love it.  Would you have, would you have, well, like you said, you had a daughter, but I think,  would you think about your family when you're kind of taking these chances years ago when  you were really in the shit? 
[02:19:00]  Yeah, you know what, you always think, I mean, unless you're really fucked up, you think  about your family.  Fuck them.  I don't care.  Where's that brothel?  So, but yeah, you do.  And you know what?  Honestly, you get to a certain point.  And that's why I left.  I left after whatever, 17 years or something.  And you get to a certain point where you realize all your kid wants is for you to be home.  They don't, they don't give a shit what you're doing.  They don't care what you're doing.  They just want you sitting on the floor playing Legos or, you know, or little army soldiers,  whatever.  And that's all they want. 
[02:19:30]  And so you get to a certain point where you got to reorder your priorities, I think.  And that's why, you know, that's essentially why I left.  Do you get frustrated how your kids play army soldiers?  Yeah.  What are you doing?  You're looking at me.  Put all your assets up front here.  You need some guys over here crying on the floor.  Can you leave your job at the office, sir?  What is it all like?  We need a sniper over here, obviously.  I got to tell my kids constantly, not all of them are going to get medals. 
[02:20:00]  All right.  Just when they show up for the conflict, they don't all get medals.  That'd be hilarious.  Always need some cannon fodder.  But you know what?  Here's the thing.  I go around and I actually like, I got a lot of, this is going to make me sound like  a complete dork.  But I got all my old little army soldiers and everything from when I was a kid, right?  My parents saved them for me.  And one day my dad, who was the world's greatest guy, you know, we were sitting around one day  having a drink and he says, hey, I got something to show you.  And we went up to the attic and he had kept all my army soldiers, all my gear, all my fake 
[02:20:30]  guns, all my stuff.  And he kept it.  Wow.  And, you know, and he was a great guy.  But anyway, so I got all these.  But now, you know, I'll be damned if I let my boys play with them because I'll break them.  But my point is when you go to the stores to try to buy a bag of army soldiers now, this  is going to sound wrong, but they're all like this.  You can't buy the old, like, here's the green for Americans and here's the gray for the Nazis.  Right.  You know, it's got to be, oh, here's all the same color.  And, you know, they're not really fighting.  They're like UN peacekeeping forces.  Yeah.  Yeah, they're just standing there. 
[02:21:00]  They're not.  You can't buy army soldiers?  Well, you can, but they're not like the old days.  You don't get Kirby with the BAR and you don't have, you know, Wojciechowicz, you know,  with a flamethrower.  God forbid you'd have him with you.  I used to love the flamethrower.  He would just lay down nice.  Yeah.  He was the guy on, he was one, he was on one knee and he had the flamethrower, the bazooka  guy.  You think it was on one knee.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Well, the sniper.  Yeah, the snipers down there.  The prone guy was hilarious because sometimes you'd want him to stand up, like you needed 
[02:21:30]  more stand-up soldiers, but you didn't have him, so you stood prone guy up and he's just  pointing up at the sky.  If you get enough of those guys pointing up at the sky, you know, like with a small craft  overhead, you could take that craft down.  Yeah, exactly.  See, he's thinking of how to utilize the resources.  Everything's got to be PC.  Oh, man.  That's hilarious.  No, but it is true.  I didn't even know that.  I finally found a bag in some old toy store that had the green and the gray.  So I took him home and I spent the rest of the afternoon teaching my two older boys, 
[02:22:00]  you know, the five and three, about World War II.  You know, and we, it was, it was, you know, I get it, it makes him sound like a complete  idiot, but there's nothing better than sitting on the floor, you know, hanging out with  your kids, you know, blowing shit up.  And then, yeah, here's the Battle of the Bulge.  Now we're going to have to take him back for interrogation because I'll bet he's got some  actionable intelligence.  Come on, kids.  All right.  Someone probably get me a wet rag and a bucket of water.  We're going to tell the, we're going to get some information. 
[02:22:30]  Well, I reenacted some of the missions he was in.  I got to have that info in their head somewhere.  Water boarding.  All right, we're going to drip water on this asshole for the next two hours.  Oh, shit.  Oh, it's a serious business.  That's good.  You know what, though?  I'd so much rather hear about World War II, especially as a very young kid, from a dad  with army soldiers and a story like that than just being popped in front of a TV or having  to read some generic book or something. 
[02:23:00]  That's a lot more interesting and compelling and fun, you know, like that.  Absolutely.  And there was a difference, too.  My dad was a pilot in World War II.  He was in the old Army Air Corps before we had an Air Force.  What did he fly?  Uh, B-17s.  Oh, man.  Those things were, you know, bullet buckets.  He was in the shit.  And he was a great guy.  And then he did a lot of things.  When he finished, you know, as the thing was starting to wind down, you know, he was involved  in all sorts of...  But he never talked about it.  And that was the thing. 
[02:23:30]  You couldn't get him to talk about it.  And it wasn't because, you know, he was a closed-mouth guy.  He was a very, you know, he's very, uh...  What's the word I'm looking for?  Eloquent.  Yeah, which he didn't pass on.  Yeah.  And, um, so...  But, uh, he was great, but he wouldn't talk.  And then a brother of mine was a F-4 pilot in Vietnam.  He did two tours.  He was a fabulous pilot.  And he still is.  He's in the commercial industry now.  That's what I want.  A phantom pilot flying my aircraft when I'm going on a trip.  That's what you want.  Yes!  Exactly. 
[02:24:00]  And that's kind of where I was going because I spent 19 hours trying to make my way around  this lovely country yesterday, just for one meeting.  Delayed flights, canceled flights.  And every time I'd get on a plane that was actually looking like it might take off, I  had the same thought.  I'd walk by a pilot who looked like he was 14 years old.  Oh, shit.  And I thought, you know, I bet he's good.  I'll bet he's got qualifications.  But, you know, yeah.  Where are the guys?  Well, I know we know where they're going.  They're all dying.  Yeah, yeah.  But, you know, the guys with the experience...  I kind of want a guy...  You know, a guy isn't going to get shaken up at an alarm going off on the flight deck 
[02:24:30]  if he's had a SAM explode off his wing and have to fucking land on a carrier at night.  Yeah, exactly.  Probably a little storm isn't going to bother him.  You think that's a little different?  Just a tad.  On a flight simulator?  Yeah.  Captain, we're out of pretzels.  Oh, my God.  Take it down.  All right, look.  We're going to have to radio an emergency.  We've got to get this thing on the ground.  All right.  We're going to take a break.  Mike Baker's in studio.  Friend of the show. 
[02:25:00]  Yes.  Going to hire him for some shit very soon.  Nice.  Nice.  Oh, yeah.  That'll turn into a reality show, I suspect.  I'm hiring you for some shit.  That would be great.  Let's just hire Mike for wacky shit.  That'd be cool.  I've had people, like listeners, stop by my house.  I've had them just come to my door and be like, Anthony, you know, hey, you got a beer?  It's me.  Hey.  Yeah, they literally have done that.  But you sound very inviting on the show.  That's why they do that.  Well, that's just it. 
[02:25:30]  It's an inviting atmosphere.  And they come over and you kind of do it to yourself.  One guy, he actually came to my door.  He was like, hey, I was just, you know, I stopped by.  I found out where you lived.  I just was wondering if I could, you know, just have a beer with you.  Was he wearing pants?  Yeah, I know.  Thank God, right?  He had assless chaps on.  But you know what?  I invited him around back and gave him a beer and sat down and asked him every fucking thing  about himself.  Because if I chase him away, get out of here. 
[02:26:00]  Now I've pissed him off and I have no idea who he is, where he's from or anything.  But I found out he literally was just some family guy from Smithtown, Long Island, that  was a fan of the show, has some kids.  He didn't seem like a lunatic.  So it kind of eased my mind.  I'd have been, like, paranoid if I had chased him away, wondering if he's going to come back  with Molotov cocktail.  That's all well and good, but you don't want that to happen again, is what you're saying.  No, you won't get a beer.  I swear to God.  You had your team up on the roof, though, lighting them up, right?  Oh, hell yeah. 
[02:26:30]  Just in case.  He was lazed like a, just all you saw were red dots all over his head.  Well, if you've got a guy stopping over at your house for a beer, you might want to call  Mike Baker at Diligence.  Sorry, Diligence, for all your home security needs.  That's right.  It's a whole new line of business for us.  How do they get a hold of you?  Yeah, how do they get you?  You know what?  Yeah, we're out there.  You can find us.  But we don't do home security.  Yeah.  But for all your global intelligence and risk management and security needs, just go to www.  I can't believe I'm saying this. 
[02:27:00]  Don't do the W's.  Yeah, www.diligence.com.  See, I told you, I took one computer course.  No.  We finally don't have to do the W's.  Yeah, diligence.com.  Diligence.com.  More with Mike Baker.  Stay there.  Sirius XM.  Sirius XM.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  Hanging with Mike Baker.  We like Mike. 
[02:27:30]  Oh, Mike's great.  Diligence.  President of Diligence.  Diligence.com.  For your security needs around the world.  You think we got a lot of listeners that need security advice?  A lot of guys sitting around the table this morning listening to this.  I sure could know if I just knew what was happening in the Congo.  I can take over the world.  You want to change gears a little bit?  What you got?  A little bit.  Well, I got something.  Oh, hell. 
[02:28:00]  I'm just going to play it.  I got a little something.  A little something.  What do you got?  Anyone?  Wow.  Anyone?  Yoko?  Yoko's new album?  Anyone?  I'm going to go with one of the Kardashians.  Anyone?  That could work, too.  What do you got?  Anyone?  Anyone?  It's the obvious.  It's the obvious.  For me, it sounds like Friday night, but still.  It's some woman, obviously, either in pleasure or pain, and a piano. 
[02:28:30]  Maybe more than one woman.  Oh.  Oh.  Is it Lesbian Wednesday?  And I didn't know it.  I just stumbled on Lesbian Wednesday.  Lesbian Wednesday.  Hey, everybody.  Is it a pew?  Lesbian Wednesday.  There's some orgasms going on there.  Oh, okay.  What else, though?  Piano.  Piano.  Good.  It sounded like a harp.  Oh, a harp?  Well, there was a harp in the background with a piano.  It's a harp.  The harp system.  Let me tell you about it. 
[02:29:00]  Anytime you get several women together, I think you need a harp in the room.  You need a harp.  To set the mood.  Otherwise, they can't get into it.  But why the orgasms is the question at hand.  They have a fetish for piano music and harp music.  Oh, shit.  You are so wrong.  I knew it.  I thought I had it.  They're orgasming.  Oh, my God.  They're all squatting on those little hammery things inside the piano.  So it touches them intimately.  You get to just go plink, plink, plink. 
[02:29:30]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  That is really creative.  Yeah.  Ding, ding, ding, ding.  Oh, ho, ho.  Not a lot of people would think about this.  I think outside the box, even when I'm thinking of the box.  Let's make an orgasm piano now.  Yeah.  All right, girls have to have their vaginas over the plinky things.  Yeah, plinky things.  And we get to play them.  I love our technical jargon.  The plinky things.  We're coming out.  Some people call them the keys.  Yeah, yeah.  Mike Baker, you laugh, but guess what we're doing in the very near future?  Yeah.  You're coming out with your own line of O&A sex toys? 
[02:30:00]  Hologram zoo.  Good idea.  Would be good.  A hologram zoo.  With a petting zoo?  With a special glove where you get to pet the dinosaurs?  And through a series of sensors and actuators, you literally feel like you're touching it.  Are there hot lesbians at the zoo?  Is that where we're going with this?  We could have that with a hologram zoo.  No, that's a hologram to buy.  We're looking for investors right now for the hologram zoo.  It's a different glove that goes on a different place, too.  Wouldn't you like to pet a dinosaur?  Honestly, who wouldn't?  I was just at the Natural History Museum with the boys looking at dinosaur bones. 
[02:30:30]  And Sammy said, you know, this is kind of crappy.  I wish it was a hologram.  And so I think you're on to something.  Ah, see?  Someone's already thinking about it.  You know what?  You take the bones that already exist and then build a hologram fucking dinosaur around it.  Around the bones?  And make it a whole thing.  Yeah.  It slowly turns into a hologram dinosaur.  But I'm confused about the lesbians.  Where were they?  They could fit in anywhere.  Yeah, that's true.  I don't think you're listening to lesbians. 
[02:31:00]  No?  Well, we're not listening to dinosaurs.  I know that.  They're having orgasms.  They are.  Are these animals that we're listening to?  Oh, man.  You want me to play a little more?  Let me hear it again, yeah.  I just don't want to give it away just yet.  Oh, man.  Oh, man.  Oh, man.  Oh, man.  Oh, man.  It just sounds like...  It is the...  Sounds like a...  That's a giveaway right there.  Cheap...  Cheap porno.  They're...  They're coming. 
[02:31:30]  Is it...  What is Rob Bartlett doing?  Bartlett's dressed...  The only mornings we go,  what is Rob Bartlett doing?  He completely distracts me.  I look and I'm just like,  fucking Bartlett's dressed like a woman,  kind of...  I think we do it for ourselves.  It's a good friend of ours.  We see him in the garage all the time.  Bartlett's great.  You do Imus?  Yeah.  You do Imus too?  Yeah.  Yeah.  It's fun.  I'm confused now at this point.  I'll play it out.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah. 
[02:32:00]  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  It is the most intimate  and powerful experience  a woman can have.  No?  Yeah, see, we're old school guys,  so we don't know what that would be.  Yeah.  I don't know.  Take care of yourself, honey.  I've got mine.  What is that?  Honey.  Hey, well, how am I supposed to know this?  Crap. 
[02:32:30]  What?  Would that be giving me an orgasm?  Yeah.  And a sandwich?  Now, you lay in the wet spot.  Right.  Oh!  Oh, good.  Good, good.  Ha, ha, ha, ha.  Ha, ha, ha.  Oh, boy.  Wow, I'm boggled.  Hmm.  All right, we'll just give it away.  All right.  Right here.  It is a very sensual experience.  Unbelievable, the sensations that are, like,  washing over your whole body. 
[02:33:00]  Introducing...  Anthony Cumia.  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.  I didn't see a new production piece.  Introducing what?  You heard him describe it.  What do you think here?  This is crazy.  All right, well, how about this?  How about this much?  They're coming.  Mm-hmm.  And I do believe it's a surprise that they're coming.  That's a huge fucking giveaway right there.  Fuck it. 
[02:33:30]  I'm coming.  God damn it.  That's what I was going to say.  It's an old clip.  It's from our 8-track porno.  Oh, my God.  The 8-track porno.  Pornos used to come in 8-tracks.  I think this is it.  Yeah, here it is.  Stop talking and start sucking.  This is very early porno.  Here it is.  Extremely early.  I'm coming, you dumb bitch.  What is that?  This is horrible.  This is just horrible. 
[02:34:00]  I'm coming, you dumb bitch.  They're surprised they're coming.  That's a huge giveaway, Ant.  Huge.  You're good at this.  They're surprised that they're coming?  You're good at this stuff.  Is it some kind of...  Well, it's got to be a sex toy.  Oh, what old game show are we playing right now with that question?  Match game or no, not match game?  What's my line?  What's my line?  What's my line?  It's not the toy.  Roll over and shut up.  $25,000.  I sucked his joint for 30 minutes and his prick was like a piece of spaghetti. 
[02:34:30]  I'm coming, you dumb bitch.  This is old school.  I lick my sweaty balls.  I'm going to fuck you in the mouth.  Oh, it comes down your throat.  This is our contract negotiations, by the way.  Lick my balls.  What negotiations?  That means the two sides have to be talking.  That's exactly why families should gather around the dinner table for conversation at night.  You know, that's what most families are missing.  They're missing that wholesome talk that is missed through the talk.  Kill you fucking whore. 
[02:35:00]  Never heard that on the honeymooners.  Hey, what about the cheeks of my ass?  Stop talking and start sucking.  All right.  I'm going to come down your throat.  You fucking well better swallow it all.  You let one drop spill and I'll rip your ass so hard you won't sit down for a week.  They really need a good foley person for that.  Yeah, the slurpy noise is weren't realistic.  Because it wasn't real.  What this was was audio porn from the old days.  It was on an 8-track. 
[02:35:30]  Literally, yeah.  Get out.  No shit.  And so it was they thought this audio porn was going to take off.  Like you could take it in the car with you or something.  So it wasn't visual and they weren't really doing anything.  It was all just like sound effects and and goofy dialogue.  I mean, it sounds like they're really engaged in sex.  Oh, doesn't it?  Yeah, yeah.  Well, they did a good job.  Great voice character.  That's great.  I believe that was Meryl Streep and De Niro.  You think for the pussy eating they were just slurping soup?  Soup!  I think I recognized one of the voices, I think, was Pinocchio in the Shrek movie later. 
[02:36:00]  Yes!  Yeah.  Yeah.  Is this going to affect your business?  Diligence?  Honestly, no.  We got a strong brand name.  We've been around.  Most people know that they can ring fence me and Diligence will get the work done for them.  Exactly.  Are you giving up trying to guess this shit?  I can't figure this out at all.  Someone on the phone's got it.  What?  Hmm?  Someone on the phone's got it.  No way, Jose.  What?  That's it. 
[02:36:30]  Oh, you know the answer?  Well, you said the phone's.  And you looked right up at it.  Damn it!  Nancy.  I hope it's a guy.  I hope he's just like, yeah, I'm a Nancy.  Nancy.  Now, now, I am a real woman.  I own a vagina and it's mine.  Oof.  And I've seen this shit where these women have these orgasms where they're having to burn.  Let me tell you, mine weren't like that.  I only wish.  So you think they're giving birth and that's why they're doing this? 
[02:37:00]  Absolutely.  I've seen this on one of those learning channel shits.  On one of these learning channel shits.  Where's the learning channel shits?  That's right.  That's what it is.  I'm showing they put these things together.  They're hoping someone calls it that learning channel shit.  That's American for you.  Over on that educational bullshit channel.  Yeah, of course, shit.  You know what?  I've been in the births of four children now.  The birthing room never sounded anything like that. 
[02:37:30]  No, it probably sounds like one of your torture rooms.  You interrogate some of those people.  You know what?  And the tray they bring in with the tools.  The tools.  You think they're going to be torturing somebody.  Holy fuck.  What is half that shit on the tray?  Uh, it's a magnetic tray.  Okay, we got it.  All right, Nancy.  Thanks for your guess.  Anyone let in napkins.  Thanks for your guess.  Knock off.  Anyway.  Wow.  So is she right?  I don't know.  What?  That's all I got.  That's it?  No, you don't. 
[02:38:00]  All right.  ...that are like washing over your whole body.  Introducing the revolutionary documentary film.  The sensual and sexual nature of birth cannot be denied.  Of birth cannot be denied.  Oh, they're having orgasms as they give birth to their children.  Is it as sexy during a C-section?  Are they really moaning and groaning as their abdomen's being cut open?  Yeah, what happens if you go with the C-section?  Anything?  Yeah.  Do you have multiple orgasms if you have twins or triplets?  All right. 
[02:38:30]  How many can shoot out?  Oh, more.  Oh, they're going to explore all this with this documentary film.  All this and more.  Cannot be denied.  That unlocks the potential of childbirth.  I really made an effort to kind of go inside myself and really try to begin the centering  that I would need to have in order to make it through the labor.  Good God.  Is it really an effort to go inside yourself considering there's a baby in there?  No, I just, you know, I'm not buying it.  I'm not buying it.  I'm not either. 
[02:39:00]  I don't think women have orgasms when they give birth?  Well, you know what?  I'm old enough now to know that I'm not going to speak on behalf of women out there.  So whatever they do or want to do, I'm staying out of their kitchen.  It just seems like, from what I've seen, that it might not be the environment for it.  Well, we've got ten female listeners, and hopefully they're not at work yet.  Yeah.  And hopefully a few of them can call us and help us out here because we're in foreign territory.  Yeah, yeah. 
[02:39:30]  Yeah.  ...that I would need to have in order to make it through the labor.  In all its pain.  It's like a sacrifice, I think, that a mother can offer.  It's a new age garbage.  Through this pain, for you to really come out in the way you need to come out.  It's pleasure.  It was so natural.  It just felt so good.  Well, this isn't that far-fetched.  Except birds.  But this isn't that far-fetched.  When you take a really good shit, man. 
[02:40:00]  It feels good.  Oh, my God.  And then you don't have to send it to college.  Right?  Yeah.  So you're equating childbirth with taking a big dump.  Look, I know we're just talking to God, so we can do this.  You've never had a good shit where you're like, you know what?  Fuck.  Never one with an umbilical cord.  My oldest boy, like I said, just turned five, he's at that age where if he takes a really  good one, he wants to show it to me.  He says, God, come up here.  And I come up there, and he's sitting there.  First of all, he really makes a production out of it. 
[02:40:30]  He could be gone for 30 minutes just to take a dump.  And then he wants you to come up and look at it.  But he doesn't want you to just kind of go, yeah, okay.  He wants you to kind of like really stare at it.  He goes, look at that.  And I know that's because kids think, well, I made that.  Wow.  But I'm hoping that by the time he's 18, he'll be over that particular thing.  Dad!  Come here, Dad!  Look at this.  Imagine that's the only way you bond with your son.  Aren't you supposed to be a work son?  I'll save all the best ones and bronze them.  Have you ever, Brother Weese tells a classic story, and he swears it's true, where he had 
[02:41:00]  a tough one going on, and he actually had to cut it, cut it free.  What?  He had to cut it free.  He had to cut it free.  And he swears.  I'm going to see him soon, and I'm going to have to ask him again.  Man, he said that he actually had to take his scissor, because he was on the bowl too  long, and he just couldn't get the other end out.  Holy.  Where it starts tapering, and it finally kind of falls out on its own. 
[02:41:30]  You've got to get to that point.  He tells this story where he actually got scissors and cut it free, because he couldn't wait any  longer.  That's fucked up right there.  Wow.  You think that's true?  He swears it is.  Do you think that's true?  You know what?  We'll look into it.  Yeah, yeah.  Let's look into that.  That'll be next week on the Learning Channel shit.  Yeah.  A story we brought you a month ago.  We'll check into it.  You think it's true?  The beauty of this show, now maybe some other guys will call and say it absolutely could happen. 
[02:42:00]  Is that necessary?  We do have Megan, though, who can help us out here.  Megan?  Oh, okay.  P.A., what's up?  Yeah, I was just calling to let you know that, actually, when women go into labor, it  kind of feels like they need to take a shit.  And they will say, like, oh, my God, I have to go take a shit.  And then, you know, especially younger girls, they'll be like, oh, I have to take a shit.  And then all of a sudden-  How many times is she going to say it?  It's kind of cool.  Thank you, Dr. Megan.  It's kind of cool when she says it, though.  Yeah, and she's like, oh, I've got to take a shit, take a shit. 
[02:42:30]  You know, they do warn you, and I swear this did not happen in our case, that you could  shit because you're pushing so hard that everything else is pushing.  Oh, man.  Yeah.  My advice to any guys that are going out there that their wives are maybe having their first  baby is don't venture down into that sector.  Just stay up in the Northern Territory, feed them ice chips, or drink all their sports drinks  that they bring to the party, and don't move south.  I love that. 
[02:43:00]  It's like, stay out of that sector.  Stay north.  Did you check out south?  What's that?  You checked it out.  Only for a brief, brief, unforgettable moment.  Oh, man.  But, no, it's a wonderful thing, and I will say I'm kind of old school.  It would be nice to be able to sit in a bar across the street, you know, drinking.  Waiting to light that cigar.  Right, with a fedora.  Right, right.  And then I call you, and then I call my friends, and then I show up, and the baby's already  swaddled.  When my daughter was born, true story, the doctor hands me the baby, and they come out, 
[02:43:30]  and they've got a soft head, right?  So their heads had to make their way through the canal, and so their head's kind of pointy.  Well, the head's pointy.  So the baby hands me, or the guy hands me the baby, and he looks at me with all seriousness,  and he says, don't worry, the head will go back into a normal shape.  You know, like I was sitting there thinking, he's just handing me my baby, and I'm thinking,  well, how am I going to get a hat to fit that head?  So a lot of shit happens in there that I think is important.  They come out with pointy heads.  Yeah, they come out with pointy heads.  But you shouldn't have to know that. 
[02:44:00]  No.  You should be outside, like you said, in a bar.  You get the phone call.  Hey, it's a boy!  And then you pass the cigars around, people buy you drinks.  The bartender gets the call, and he says, I'll tell him.  And he hangs up.  He's like, it's a boy!  I'll tell him.  The bartender tells you.  Exactly.  But that's how it went down.  Oh, it was great.  I'll let him know.  The gals took care of all that other stuff.  By the time you get back, the kid's already got hair and teeth.  Think about how far we've gone.  I was talking about this with a buddy of mine who's got kids now that are going into sports. 
[02:44:30]  They're, I guess, whatever, just before middle school.  And he was talking about, oh, my God, he's stressed because he's missing a practice.  And you start thinking about that.  And if I had told my dad, look, Dad, we want to spend the weekend.  You're going to drive me up and down the East Coast going to tournaments.  And then you're going to be at all my practices.  And he would have looked at me, and he was the best dad ever.  And he was going to look at me like I had two heads.  And we've gone so far to the other side.  And I'm not saying that it's all started because we have to be in the birthing room.  But we go crazy now.  And we feel guilty if we're not at a practice. 
[02:45:00]  Yeah, yeah.  I don't know.  I think we're taking it too far to the extreme.  And I do agree with that whole notion that we're creating generations of coddled kids.  I think so, yeah.  I think we were talking about it, too, that kids don't just normally just go out anymore on their own  to just goof around with your friends, you know, explore the woods.  Just anything like that.  It's always this very regimented thing that the parents are involved or some set of parents' supervision.  Right.  We're having play dates. 
[02:45:30]  And we're going to take you to your class.  And then we're going to take you to a sports camp.  And then we're going to do this.  And we used to just go out and make our own fun.  And we learned how to organize ourselves.  And we learned how to play games.  It was like Lord of the Flies.  And deal with the problems.  Yeah, it was like Lord of the Flies.  Yeah, yeah.  Who gets to be Piggy?  He's working the board.  It's funny.  Oh, you rock.  Mike, I got a two-year-old.  Yesterday, we went to a place.  And to sign him up.  Indoor gym with classes.  A little fucking art class.  Music class.  A little this, a little that.  It starts now.  Holy fuck. 
[02:46:00]  It starts now.  Because if you don't do this, he's not going to get into an Ivy League school.  And then some asshole lady.  It's a resume.  That I saw.  Fucking three.  That I saw at the juice shop.  Says, have you started looking?  It's called a synagogue.  Stop.  Oh.  She goes, I don't even know this lady.  I just saw her online.  And she saw my kids.  So she starts asking questions.  And she goes, have you started looking at the schools yet?  I'm like, he's two.  Oh, God.  You're kidding me?  You're behind.  You do realize if you don't do it by September, you're going to have a bad school for your kid. 
[02:46:30]  Yeah.  He's two.  Yeah.  You know what?  Supposedly.  And then I asked other people.  And they said, no, that's true.  You got to start.  And you got to interview.  Right.  Interview to get into pre-K.  Right.  Amazing.  You go into an interviewing process in Manhattan.  How the hell does that even work?  Because unlike other places, most places you just kind of go to the school in your area  unless you're a hoity-toity dick and then you send them to private schools.  Right.  But in New York, everyone does pick their school.  Right.  It's not the one that's right up the block. 
[02:47:00]  It's a track.  If you don't get into this one, you're not getting into that one.  And if you don't get into that one, you've got to be.  So it all starts at two, three years old.  This used to be stuff people didn't have to worry about until like colleges.  Like, what did you do in high school so you could get into a good college, college so  you could get into, you know, some kind of post-fucking.  But I got friends with kids that are going into college and honest to God, they spent  month after month after month stressing about their kids' college essays and writing them  and drafting them and editing their applications.  I mean, the parents doing this.  Right.  And then getting tutors to work with these kids. 
[02:47:30]  Right.  And to do that.  You know, my dad walked downstairs, I remember this, closed the bell, knocked on my door,  hey, and he said, what are you going to do about college?  And I said, I guess I'm going to go.  Oh, and then I found a couple of applications.  You know, you had to go to the guidance counselor's office because we didn't have anything online.  And so they would have some handbooks for colleges and you'd leaf through and say, well,  that looks like a nice one.  And then you'd maybe fill out a form.  I told my daughter, and she's a terrific kid, and I said, not going to do any of this  for you.  I'm not going to write.  It's not my job.  It's not your mother's job to write your essays, to write your applications. 
[02:48:00]  You do the research.  You do the work.  And I got a call from her mom, you know, and she said, she was panicking.  She said, did you see her application of her essays?  She sent them off already.  And she was, and I said, well, no, I didn't really.  She showed me one essay and it was, it was good.  It read like a kid wrote it, right?  It read like a high school kid wrote this essay, but it was good.  It talked about who she was and yet it didn't, it wasn't professional.  And so I thought, hey, that's great.  That's fine.  If it works, I think that's going to be wonderful.  And they'll know it's hers, not the parent doing it, but, but all the way through. 
[02:48:30]  So from starting from two, all the way through, it never, it never ends.  Now we're doing this to ourselves.  Well, my, uh, my siblings have older kids and what amazes me is that the parents are  doing the homework alongside their kids now.  Right.  Remember you would maybe go downstairs.  My dad loved the Knicks.  He'd be watching the Knicks and I might have a math problem, you know, help me out a little  bit.  Yeah.  But it, what, but everyone knew you had to do your own fucking homework.  You could.  Right.  You know, ask for a little help here and there or get a tutor.  But now it's, it's completely normal to do the homework for your kids. 
[02:49:00]  That's fucked up.  Yeah.  No, I know a lot of parents that sit there at the table with their kids for two hours.  They sit there for two hours with their kids to make sure they get it.  I don't have that luxury because I don't understand.  But even by five years old, I don't know what the hell they're doing.  Yeah.  But one of my siblings said, uh, I had a relearned, you know, subjects all over again.  Cause I'm doing their homework for them.  Right.  And this isn't crazy because all the parents are doing that because they're all so competitive.  So it's like, oh, fuck though.  If he did it on his own, it's a B. 
[02:49:30]  But if I do it, you know, hopefully we'll get that grade higher for you.  Well, you got kids out there six years old with their own batting coach, right?  Or their own pitching coach.  Really?  Like, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Like pro ball players.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  So, I mean, just let them have fun, right?  Let them, let them try different sports.  We don't, we don't even do that anymore.  You gotta, God forbid, you gotta specialize in soccer.  You gotta specialize in baseball because otherwise you're not going to be able to play in middle  school or high school.  You know, we used to play whatever was in season.  We played every sport.  Right.  Every fucking sport.  Hey, we got a guy that pinched his own poo.  Jesus Christ. 
[02:50:00]  We go from that.  That's why.  Yeah.  Boy, we're going to have this show.  Yeah.  I love it.  It's got its peaks and ebbs, ebbs and flows, peaks and valleys.  Oz in Florida.  Oz.  Yeah, yeah.  Way to backtrack on that great subject.  But about 15 years ago, I had surgery on my knee and it was the summertime, so no one  was home.  I had to basically crawl to the bathroom.  I'm sitting on the toilet.  And it's big shit because I was so constipated because I was so full of pills.  I just sat there and it was just, you know, trying to hobble up and down and swing my 
[02:50:30]  ass.  I had no other choice to just stick my hand between my legs and just pinch it at the  top so it would fall in the toilet and wipe my ass and go back to bed.  Why?  Yep.  See, why do we need that story?  Wow.  See, that's a surgery story.  Surgery?  No, I mean, it was because of surgery.  There's sometimes, you know, some shit that kind of makes it a little too hard and you  don't want to sit there forever and you fucking cut it off.  I wrote Weiss.  We'll see if he writes back.  I wrote, isn't it true that you once cut your poo free? 
[02:51:00]  You got to sit there until your legs fall asleep.  If I had a dollar every time I got a text like that.  Yeah.  You really do just have to sit there until your legs fall asleep.  But that was a lovely story from Oz.  It really was.  Yeah.  Thanks so much for that.  You've got the most sharing.  We love them.  Consider it.  Yeah.  Great.  We love these assholes.  Thanks.  You want more on the orgasm birthday?  I love their sharing.  And there was another story about how, like, the wife and the kid both shitting in the 
[02:51:30]  delivery room.  Oh, yeah.  Wow.  Yeah.  See, I don't know.  It's just...  How did this degenerate to them?  Yeah.  I just don't see it happening.  It's all...  I'm not saying it's overly clinical.  Which is not.  You know, but you just get in, you get your business done.  You know, it seems like the way it works.  The only reason why I feel bad about the subject at hand is that Mike Baker is in a very nice  suit and his tie is all the way up tight.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  I got a knot.  I might even have a Windsor knot going right now.  That is a good knot, right?  Yeah, it's a knot.  Something is wrong with this whole... 
[02:52:00]  I'm heading out to business meetings.  I'm going to try to convince clients to give us some money.  Yeah, yeah.  And I use that voice when I do it.  Don't convey any of these stories.  I use to the clients.  Well, before I go to my client meeting, I am going to go pinch off a...  Yeah, yeah.  Just pinch one off your scissors, though.  I want to use your fingers.  Well, that's where the term pinch comes from, obviously, but sometimes you have to get a  scissor instead of your own...  Well, I assume the pinch isn't from your fingers.  No, I know.  I get it.  It just seems a little...  That's a whole other line of tools you could create that might sell, you know, the poo 
[02:52:30]  pinching tool.  We're busy with our hologram zoo.  Yeah, that's a good point.  A lot of patents.  We're all about the hologram zoo.  I'm telling you.  You laugh, but let's fast forward a few years.  This idea will happen.  Back to the documentary film on women having orgasms while giving birth.  Through this pain, for you to really come out in the way you need to come out.  It's pleasure.  It was so natural.  It just felt so good.  I loved it. 
[02:53:00]  Even ecstasy.  All of the pathways...  The catching?  ...that are involved in sexual pleasure are, in fact, stimulated by birthing a baby.  Really?  And when you can allow yourself to open in the same way that you open to orgasm, the exact  same experience is possible.  Joyous.  Go.  Sensuous.  No, it's not.  It's a mess.  Enlightening.  It's a disaster.  It's got to be like it is when you make it up with somebody. 
[02:53:30]  It looks like a sucking chest wound, doesn't it?  Yeah.  And then, Mike, you've seen a few of those sucking chest wounds.  Probably looks like that.  Does it look like a head wound?  Yeah.  What does it look like?  Again, it doesn't look like a porno.  I can tell you that much.  No.  No.  Pink mist?  Get a bunch of pink mist when that happens.  You realize.  They sound like they're in a 70s French documentary.  Yes.  You know, don't they?  They sound like those people that are wearing flowy robes and one step away from a cult.  I got the answer.  What?  Should we do it after the break?  This is a good fucking tease right here. 
[02:54:00]  Brother Lee wrote back.  All right.  Let's see what he says.  After the break.  No, no.  We're going to the end.  Fuck this.  Get out of here early.  Going to blame it on Mike Baker.  Yeah.  It is my fault.  Here we go.  We got three text messages.  He was excited to fucking write back.  Brother Lee's.  The question once again was, isn't it true that you once cut your poo free?  He writes, I cut it in the crapper to fit down the drain.  Wow.  The hell was he laying out? 
[02:54:30]  Was that in the nom?  I cut it in the crapper.  Was he backed up?  To fit down the drain.  Well, that's just never going down.  I got to do something.  Wait, he's got many stories, though.  Oh, I bet.  He's all about it.  And I once had a poo stuck halfway out the keep when I was making out with a brand new Doreen.  And I thought she smelled like shit.  He had one poking out as he was making out with his now wife.  You get this in? 
[02:55:00]  Yes.  He has his own language, so he says, and I once had a poo stuck halfway out the keep when I was making out with a brand new Doreen, and I thought she smelled like shit.  I was depressed.  Then, when I found out it was my, hold on a minute, it was my own poop, it was disgusting but a relief because I dug her and thought I was going to have to cut her stably ass loose.  Stably, S-T-A-B-L-Y, stably, stably. 
[02:55:30]  So there you go.  There you go.  So I guess he cut one up so it would fit down the drain.  He was excited right back, man.  That's something right there.  He wasn't busy with his own radio show.  I'm sure he would call.  Maybe he could call real fast.  How many more minutes have we got?  What's our fucking hotline number?  E-Rock?  Oh, I don't know it. 
[02:56:00]  All right.  Here's the rest of the documentary thing.  It's almost over.  It's got to be like it is when you make love with someone.  It's got to be safe and secure and uninterrupted.  And that is how you will have an orgasmic birth.  Well, children have the same effect on Sandusky.  Orgasmic birth.  It will change the way you think about childbirth and yourself forever.  If you were told that you could have one of the most physically, emotionally, spiritually, 
[02:56:30]  transcendent moments of your life, and here's the map to get there,  would you really say no?  I'd just use my nav map.  What the hell are they talking about?  I don't know.  That would be too much pressure, man.  You've got to take that and just shred it.  Well, she gave a birth to your child.  Now you've got to make sure she has an orgasm.  Fuck that.  That sounds dirty.  It's hard enough to figure out the combination sometimes.  Now you've got to make sure she has an orgasm in the birthing room.  Women should just be in there with a fucking doctor. 
[02:57:00]  Push, push, push.  They're done.  That's it.  Orgasm.  I don't know.  And what's the doctor doing during this time?  Yeah, you have that shit.  Yeah, I like the old guy in there who's talking about it.  There's always a guy.  There's always some dude in something like this who's generated the idea because it's  getting his rocks off.  Yeah, because he's fucking feeling it.  Baby comes out.  The doctor fucking spanks the mom.  Yeah, you like it. 
[02:57:30]  You bad mother, aren't you?  No, the baby needs...  Want to hear about a wire hand?  Put the baby on the eating table.  No, no, mom is a big, dirty mom.  Were you confused when your kid popped out for the first time?  No, not as confused as I was when they popped out for the second time.  No, they only come out once in case people are wondering, oh my god, I didn't know how  this worked.  I mean for the first game, obviously.  No, I know.  Because I was like, I couldn't wrap my head around it.  I'm like, what the fuck is... 
[02:58:00]  We just gave birth to an alien.  Like, who are you?  Who are you?  What is this?  It is amazing.  And then you're completely worried that you're going to have something to drop the  kid or, you know, rightly so.  And then you get the second or third or fourth one and they're just like, yeah, whatever.  Where's the kid?  And you're just like, whatever.  I don't know.  Duct tape him to a wall.  It'll be all right.  Keep track of him.  You do realize if their skull could be a pointy skull that they could handle a lot of shit.  That would be good.  And then you call him the rhino. 
[02:58:30]  They could be like a superhero with a pointy head.  But no, it is.  It's very confusing at first because you don't really understand it.  It's like, wait, this is a live fucking thing that just...  Yeah.  And then quickly you get over that, obviously.  And nobody gives you really a manual or anything.  It's not like you end up going home and you got this thing.  But the women do seem to...  You know, all that crap about it's a learned environment, you know, and everybody's on the  same...  Bullshit.  You know, women, you know, they have that nurturing instinct.  They have an ability to say, okay, this must be how it's done. 
[02:59:00]  And, you know, I'm holding the baby by the ankle trying to dip them into a bath water  saying, well, maybe this is what you do.  I think...  So there is that difference.  And then having watched a girl and now the boys grow up, it's completely different.  There's no bullshit about it's a learned environment and let, you know, Bobby be Susie and all that  bullshit.  It's the boys are different.  The girls are different.  Why the fuck do we worry about this shit?  And we're so...  I don't know where I'm going with this, but...  No.  It drives you crazy.  You know, it's sounding...  It's bringing a tear to my heart.  Treat the boys different, you know.  It's sounding like my dad now. 
[02:59:30]  My dad's like, Jesus Christ, Anthony, what the hell are you going to grow up to be a  sissy?  What are you doing?  I'm like, yeah.  Because one time I tried...  I was making a puppet.  A marionette, right?  It always goes back to a puppet.  I was making a marionette.  Yeah.  But I hadn't applied the strings and the little cross piece...  Like, can I ask you something?  Yeah.  Were you going to apply the strings?  I had all intentions.  Or is this your out on the story?  I had all intentions of doing that.  You had the string purchased?  No.  I was a kid.  I was going to forage for things. 
[03:00:00]  What do you mean purchase?  I need popsicles and sticks and threads and whatever I could find.  All right.  All right.  In the meantime, all I had made was the marionette portion without strings and the cross piece,  which is a doll.  And when I walked around with this thing, my dad was none too happy.  Because he was old school.  You know.  He didn't want Anthony walking around with a doll.  And then I told him, it's not a doll, it's a puppet. 
[03:00:30]  And he went, Ro, get that goddamn doll away from Ro being my mom.  And I remember this.  It was a traumatic experience.  And she had the task of taking the doll away from you?  Goddammit, Joey, it's a puppet.  And he's like, it's not a puppet, it's a doll.  And I'm sitting there like, eh.  It's an anatomically correct puppet.  Right.  All right.  It's a stringless puppet.  He just wanted to play Army soldiers with you.  Yeah.  The only doll a boy I think should be carrying is a G.I. Joe.  We got a couple of G.I. Joes with a squad automatic weapons.  Oh, yeah.  And that's okay. 
[03:01:00]  The boys play with those and they blow things up.  Hey, look, Mike.  I had that too.  Okay.  I did have the G.I. Joes.  You got to have the G.I. Joes.  It's not, you know, it's not, I wasn't completely out there with the doll thing.  No.  He was an action figure.  Were you accepting of the black G.I. Joe?  Yeah.  Of course.  I was very, I had a very diverse G.I. Joe crew.  I had a helicopter.  He always had to go on IED duty, though.  Yeah, he really did.  He was always defusing the bombs.  You know.  You gave him the awful test.  He was like Kowalski, right?  Kowalski, you always knew that kid was going to get shot, right? 
[03:01:30]  Kowalski was like, oh, Kowalski.  The good Italian from Brooklyn, he was always going to take it, right?  Yeah, yeah.  What kind of missions did you give your black G.I. Joe in?  Well, I did give him the landmine thing to sweep for mines.  And for some reason, when I put the G.I. Joe in the space suit in the capsule, because  they had a G.I. Joe space capsule.  I had a helicopter.  The black guy had no space suit, but he was in space.  That's good.  I don't know what I was thinking.  He didn't get a helmet?  Back then, no.  He got nothing. 
[03:02:00]  He's like Ving Rhames.  He got nothing and like it.  No, I just, you know, you end up treating them differently.  And, you know, even my boys at this age, you know, they've got certain phrases they can  use.  And they know, you know, pull your boots up or, you know, quit whining.  And you do.  You treat your girls differently.  You treat your boys differently.  And I don't think there's absolutely anything wrong with that.  I mean, it's just, you know, it kind of, and then you extend it down the road.  And I do.  I think we're just, we're creating generations of soft individuals who expect shit given 
[03:02:30]  to them constantly and, you know, always think that they're exceptional.  And we see that sometimes people coming in for, for job interviews, you know, and they  say, what do you want to do?  And they say, well, I want to, you know, I want to get my ideas straight across to the  boss.  And I said, well, I'm the boss and that's not going to happen.  But, you know, I mean, you, you, they, they have a certain anticipation that their opinions,  you know, matter exceptionally, you know, and, and I don't expect a lot right away.  I expect a lot.  We, we, we've, uh, we're talking about this the other day as well.  You know, like Ant said earlier, I don't know if it was on air. 
[03:03:00]  We've been at this 18 years now and we've had a lot of interns and these, these interns  these days, I'm like, I look, I'm like, seriously, man, do you realize how easy it would be for  you if you just worked really hard?  Cause everyone around you is like you where you're just expecting shit.  Right.  I tell people that all the time.  You, all you have to do is just work a little bit and a little bit harder.  And you can be way ahead of everybody your age.  Right.  It's like, you know, it's like, that's the secret.  It's like information.  If you have a little bit more information, you're going to do incredibly, uh, well, better  than the others. 
[03:03:30]  Uh, more importantly, wheezes on the hotline.  Oh, they didn't have to pick it up.  Put it on.  No, we did it because in case you were cursing.  That's why.  Oh, it's on the air.  I apologize.  Oh, no cursing now.  Yeah.  No curse.  Wheezy.  Oh, hold on.  Opiates, Billy.  I'm going to put you on your way.  Hey, Billy.  How are you, buddy?  How are you doing, man?  How's the family and everything?  Oh, it's, it's awesome.  Thank you.  How's that music show of yours on the weekend?  It's been canceled, Opiates.  Oh, wow.  Oops.  I don't know what he's talking about.  Rubbing that in. 
[03:04:00]  He gets a tattoo of hair.  I don't know.  That's just a, Opiates.  Wheezy.  What's going on?  I got Anthony today and I got Mike Baker today.  And Mike Baker, you know, he's an ex-CIA guy, but he doesn't, he doesn't talk, unfortunately.  He doesn't have any good stories.  Yeah, I'm sure.  Yeah.  He's got a few, but he just, you know, he can't really just.  Yeah, he's good.  He's good for the show.  Blur it out.  But the stuff I want him to talk about, he's not going to.  I only released the classified information in the first half of the show.  Yeah.  So, because of that, we had to talk about other stuff, like, are we on with you, too? 
[03:04:30]  We're on the air as we speak.  Are you allowed to say the poo word?  Poo is the word about it.  All right.  We can say poo.  We got into a.  By the way, we can also say shiznit.  Shiznit.  Wow.  He got me for a second there.  I thought he was going for it.  I can't.  I remember a story you told me where you cut one free.  No, I don't remember cutting one free.  You might be confused.  But, listen, if you want to talk, I do have a great poop story besides the ones I wrote you. 
[03:05:00]  Okay.  I already told those on our show, so.  Bro, I got a poop story.  If you give me 60 seconds, I swear to God, this sounds like the fakest radio story ever.  Okay.  And it is so true, and I think you're going to love the reason.  Let me break this down quickly.  I just did this at Morning Show Boot Camp on a panel instantaneously.  My producer here, Pauly Guilamo, sitting right next to me, but Willie's laughing over here.  Pauly, we have, you know my building, bro, we have two elevators we have to come up? 
[03:05:30]  Yeah, of course.  One day, Pauly, at about a quarter to four in the morning, took a dump in the elevator.  Wait, wait, listen to this.  Pauly, tell him I ain't lying.  Not lying.  He took a dump by accident in the elevator.  He immediately, because it was a quarter to four, ran home.  Hell of a fast elevator.  He ran home to try to get cleaning material, a bucket, the whole thing.  He was going to try and clean it up before everybody got out.  Whoa, whoa, I got to slow you down.  He didn't do it in his pants? 
[03:06:00]  He was wearing shorts.  It was the summer.  It came out the shorts.  All right, gotcha.  Listen to this, bro.  This is the part where it starts sounding even faker, and we got some great audio to go with it.  Listen to this.  You know about Clear Channel.  It's owned by Bain Capital, and I'm going to get trouble here.  I'm just saying facts.  Clear Channel has gone through two purges since we've been here, where they fire like lots of people.  The day before this kid pooped in the elevator, the a.m. morning guy here lost his 30-year female partner to attrition. 
[03:06:30]  Listen to this, bro.  This is true.  The dude comes in.  He's a straight a.m. morning show host.  The dude comes in at 4 o'clock in the morning before this kid gets back and steps in the poop.  Let's just swear to God, strike me and all my kids dead off.  This guy steps in the poop the day after he loses his 30-year partner, the straight morning show host.  This kid wasn't even going to tell us about it, but he got busted because the guy stepped in the poop.  Now, wait. 
[03:07:00]  We got audio of the guy on his a.m. show.  Can I play it?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Oh, please.  This is an a.m. morning talk show host.  Chet Walker on WHAM.  Chet Walker.  I know Chet.  I go way back with Chet.  Someone has defecated in the elevator.  To which he went.  What?  I know someone has asked in the elevator.  Stop it.  He's talking.  I mean, we should have set it up.  I didn't know what it was.  He's talking to the security guard, right? 
[03:07:30]  Polly.  When he comes.  Oh, wait.  That's not on his show?  That is on his show.  What I'm saying is.  Okay.  I didn't realize we should have set it up.  I didn't know where it started.  He comes up the one elevator.  We have to sign in with a security guard before we go up the other elevator.  He is enacting what happened when he got off the elevator.  And he's got the poop on the shoe and he's talking to the security guard.  Oh, man.  Someone has defecated in the elevator. 
[03:08:00]  To which he went.  What?  I know someone has asked in the elevator.  Is that all we have?  We don't have the whole rant?  It goes on from there, huh?  Oh, yeah.  You know, the part that killed me was he's such a good radio guy.  He never, I think the best part of the story is who took the dump.  The guy on the other stupid radio show.  He doesn't even tell.  Wow.  Unbelievable.  See, there you go.  I told you he was good for one. 
[03:08:30]  No, that is.  That is.  I mean, to me, it's one thing the kid took a dump in the elevator.  But the fact that the morning talk show dude stepped in it and he just lost his partner the day before.  It's unbelievable.  It sounds so made up.  Yeah, that's great.  And it happened, though.  That's beautiful.  The only sad part of the story is that Paulie probably only has, like, two years to live that that would actually happen.  Yeah.  That digestive system.  Why did he leave it in the elevator?  He was going home.  He wanted it.  It was 3.30 in the morning. 
[03:09:00]  He thought he could clean it up before anybody found out.  Oh.  Yeah.  I hear Jamie there.  How did Bob Kelly do this weekend?  He had such a great weekend, man.  I went and saw him.  Honestly, one of the funniest guys aside from Norton I have seen this year.  He's a great comic, man.  He's phenomenal.  Bob Kelly's an amazing stand-up.  I want to say hi to Mike Baker.  He guest-hosted for Greg Gutfeld last time I was on Red Eye.  Hey, man.  Jamie.  Yeah.  How you doing?  Good, man.  How you doing?  I'm doing good.  I'm doing good.  We're telling poop jokes. 
[03:09:30]  Yeah.  And we also, yeah, I should send you this audio.  There's a documentary film coming out where women have the big O as they're giving birth.  Oh, I'd love to see that.  Yeah, I guess it's just a trailer right now.  Wait, it's on YouTube if you guys want to.  Honestly, I think hearing it is probably better than seeing it.  Oh, that's not it?  Yeah.  I thought I had a link for you.  I'll text you the link if you guys are doing more radio because we're not.  We're leaving.  Oh, Bob.  One more thing.  There's a guy on the phone that called in and thinks he knows the story that I forgot that you're thinking of. 
[03:10:00]  I'm telling you, man.  You know, I'm letting you slide, but after drinking some wine, I've heard that story twice.  And I want to see if his callers are as lame as ours.  Yeah, we...  Jeff.  Wait, I remember exactly.  Tell it quick.  You told this about one of your friends cutting a hemorrhoid out of your age.  Yeah, I know that, but he said poop.  I do have a friend.  I'll say his...  I can't say his name, but I have...  Give us his last name.  I have a for Smith.  Okay.  I am with that.  It is a man.  I have a friend. 
[03:10:30]  That's nuts.  I don't think this is what Opie's thinking about, but I do have a friend that ate hashish.  You guys know what hashish is?  Oh, yeah.  Sure.  I have a friend that ate hashish and cut his own hemorrhoid out with a razor blade.  Wow.  God.  Okay.  I don't think that's what Opie was thinking about.  Nope.  Nope.  All right.  What is the story?  That you were, you know, I'm trying to keep it safe for you.  You were doing your thing in the bathroom, and it was taking so long, and you were having 
[03:11:00]  a problem, you know, finishing, let's say, and you decided, I got to cut this free, because  I got stuff to do.  Well, I mean, I've not done it with a knife.  Well, I don't know if a knife...  I think the story goes, you use scissors.  Man, I don't remember this...  It's like cutting yourself out of a parachute harness when you're stuck in a tree.  Hey, Jim, we're talking to you.  Is he there?  He's gone.  Norton?  Oh, no.  Jimmy's doing Leno tonight.  Oh, we're talking...  He's on one of those radio tours tomorrow. 
[03:11:30]  Ah.  Yeah, he's got his big special that he filmed in Cleveland.  That's this weekend.  Hope, are you coming next week or not coming?  Just say.  I'm coming.  Oh, we got...  I got new stuff to show you.  I saw the...  I'm following Jake's Instagram, and I saw the new fucking...  Oh.  Oh.  What did he say?  Oh.  It finally happened.  You get that?  You get that?  Wait a minute, bro.  Bro, Doreen might have a poop.  Bubby.  There's a lot of poop stories about you, Bub. 
[03:12:00]  Well, I told him.  I wrote him the one about you.  Oh, okay.  So you thought it was...  That's the one I thought they were talking about.  Well, yeah.  You could help us out with that story.  So, Wheeze texted me, and he said that he was making out with you, Doreen, and he thought  you smelled like...  We were the first time together.  The first time together, you guys were making out, and he thought you smelled really bad,  but it was actually something that was going on with his body that might have been poking  out.  Oh, God.  See, I still know how to do regular radio.  We were doing more than making out.  No, no, bro.  It was the first time I banged my wife. 
[03:12:30]  Oh, you didn't write that in the text.  You said you were just making out.  No, well, I said that.  It was the first time we were banging in my cool apartment, and man, I loved it, and I  was in love with the chick, and all of a sudden, she smells like shiznit, and I was so depressed.  I was going, am I going to have to break up with this drug?  She smells like crap, and I reached back, and I had a poopy halfway out of my cushion.  It was you.  Well, I got to step in and ask a question.  Doreen, this is Mike Baker.  Did you...  What about on your side of the equation?  Did you notice anything unusual, or did you smell anything? 
[03:13:00]  I didn't, as far as I remember.  I was a little...  He finally got me drunk enough.  That's how he got me in bed.  Nice.  I think that might have helped deter from the smelling part.  It's a classic love story.  Yeah, it sounds it, right?  Here's the worst of being with a radio guy, you guys.  The first I ever heard of this story was I was at work at Kodak, and I heard him telling  the story on the radio.  Oops.  Until then, I didn't know that it even happened. 
[03:13:30]  I didn't know that he had the dingleberry in his butt.  It wasn't a dingleberry.  It was a half a poopy.  Yeah.  Don't sell him short, Doreen.  Really, man.  I feel good in bed.  I make guys poop their pants.  That's great.  Bob, hope he's coming up.  Get his room ready.  Okay.  See you, Bob.  Oh, yeah.  I'm going to be bringing Hudson.  Oh, Hudson will be there, yes.  Okay.  You're not allowed unless he's there.  All right, let me ask you.  That whole thing sounded like a Nora Ephron love story. 
[03:14:00]  Yeah.  That whole thing, wasn't it?  Wasn't that her last movie?  I think so.  I think so.  She was going to write.  We said Barbra Streisand is Doreen.  Yeah, we can write up a treatment for that.  We can write up a treatment and send that out to Hollywood for you, Wees.  Thank you very much.  I love you guys.  I'm getting the hell out of here.  Yeah, we.  I guess we are, too.  Yeah, thanks, Wees.  I'll see you next week.  See you a few days.  A few what?  See you what?  A few days.  A few days.  I'm doing my 4th of July thing up there.  Oh, you're going up there for the 4th, huh?  Oh, he's got a great spot up there. 
[03:14:30]  You know what's great about, and a lot of people get annoyed that the 4th of July falls  in the middle of the week because it's like, eh, it's not a weekend.  I don't know quite what to do.  Here's how I see it.  There's a party the weekend before the 4th of July, on the 4th of July, and then the weekend  after the 4th of July.  So you've got three parties now for one holiday.  Wow.  This is great.  That's terrific.  It is good timing.  It's really good timing.  It kind of works.  And you know you get the day off, and then we're going to take a few days off, too, because  that's how we roll.  Yeah.  We spend, we go up to the Hamptons every 4th of July with some friends of ours. 
[03:15:00]  Oh, the Hamptons.  Yeah, the Hamptons.  It's not our place, as you can imagine.  Ah, well.  Yeah.  But it's a nice spread.  It's right there on the water, a lot of property, and what we do is every year we do the same  thing.  We spend, it's about an eight-hour airsoft and Nerf gun battle, and we split off into teams, and we  spend eight hours, literally, and we do it, and it's like a, you know, it's like the  NCAAs.  You know, you knock teams out of the running, and eventually you end up with your champion.  Wow.  That sounds fun. 
[03:15:30]  It is good fun.  You guys shoot fireworks at each other?  We used to as kids.  Of course, we all did.  Yeah.  Bottle rockets, rule.  Yeah.  Because they didn't really do any damage either.  No.  I threw an M-80 at a buddy of mine, and it got caught in his, wearing one of those shirts  with the big pockets in there, and it got caught in his pocket.  Oh, man.  Yeah, I got in a lot of trouble for that one.  That wasn't good.  Yeah.  That wasn't good.  What happened to the guy?  He's okay now.  He's gotten over it.  No, he was, you know, it hurt and caused some damage, and he had to go to the emergency  room, but, you know. 
[03:16:00]  And then you learn.  You learn not, kids, you learn not to do stupid things like that.  Right.  Yeah, explosives are a dangerous and serious thing.  But we started the show with stuff like kids just don't understand nowadays, for real,  because the world has changed.  Yeah.  These block parties on Long Island, you would just, like, fight your neighbors every  Fourth of July with bottle rockets, whatever you can find.  Just throwing M-80s and ash cans over the fence.  You would have your own firework display right in the middle of the street.  You wouldn't go to the local beach.  It was right there.  We would take our air rifles, and we would go out in the woods. 
[03:16:30]  We'd split up into opposing forces.  And, you know, if you were lucky, your dad had a pair of, like, you know, woodworking  glasses that you could put on.  Right, right.  You know, and then you had a rule that says, okay, no more than five pumps on the air rifle.  Ah, that's got a story on this.  Yeah.  It always starts with the rules.  Yeah.  And nobody, exactly.  Oh, wait.  I forgot.  Well, you know, you've got a target down there, and you know five pumps isn't going to get  to him, so.  Right, right.  Yeah, yeah.  If we're allowing five, I'm sure six is okay, right?  Yeah, I'm going to hit.  I got it.  It's never good at math.  Yeah.  It's going to hit with the same force, but I'm further away. 
[03:17:00]  And it tells a good story.  Well, similar, but it's got a good take on, you know, we used to have acorn fights.  Yeah, what could an acorn do?  Or a dirt bomb fight.  Dirt bombs.  And then Ant says, you know, after a while, you're like, well, you run out of dirt bombs  around you, so the rocks are.  There's a rock.  Can't be that much worse.  It is what it is.  Yeah, the kids will get over it.  But you don't, you know, nowadays, you know, God forbid, you know, we can't let the kids  out back and do their thing, and, you know, okay.  I mean, I don't think there's more weirdos, and people always say, well, you know, crime, 
[03:17:30]  and, you know, there's more pedophiles, and I don't think there's more weirdos.  I think it's what you were saying before, you know, we're aware of it more, because  there's more information, right?  Yeah.  And we're linked more to it.  So we know that, you know, there's a problem.  But the problem existed, and we would just put our kids out there and give them some  common sense and hope that they would, you know, show up for dinner at the end of the  evening.  You know what?  We've also entered into this thing where, all right, I'd lob a rock over the fence at my  neighbor during a dirt bomb fight or something.  The kid gets hit in the head.  He bleeds, runs into his house. 
[03:18:00]  Uh, maybe my mom gets a call from his mom and, you know, straighten shit out.  Now, the cops would come.  I'd probably be arrested as a kid.  My parents might be arrested for hitting the kid in the head.  Uh, that family would now sue my family.  And then my family would probably figure out how to sue the people that built the house  for having too much rock content in the soil.  Like, it just would become this big litigious disaster.  And there would be regulations written.  Regulations would have to be written. 
[03:18:30]  And it's just, that's, that's why people just hide now.  Hide the kids.  Hide yourself.  Don't be liable for anything.  We did a, we did a thing one time and, and we got, this is where I probably got in more  trouble when I was, I was young than, than any other incident.  But we, again, we kind of split off into teams and we each had a dumpster and we had to sort  of like the, the, the, the, the DMZ.  Come on, we were girls back then.  Don't call them that.  Yeah.  I know.  And, and we, we would throw, uh, empty bottles, uh, at each other across this DMZ. 
[03:19:00]  Wow.  And, and, and, you know, the glass just shattering.  And, and we were, I think we were like nine or 10 years old.  Man, you sure knew what you wanted to do when you grew up.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Anyway, the school janitor came out and, uh, and that's how we all got busted.  And he was, of course, he was pissed.  And he was like this guy, he looked like chef from South Park.  Oh, did he?  Old guy grizzled.  And, uh, and we were laughing and, and, you know, we, okay, we got caught, you know,  and then, you know, and the parents had to, you know, they'd say, okay, you can't  do that.  That's a stupid thing to do.  And usually, and we learned the lesson and we didn't, we moved on to other things. 
[03:19:30]  Yeah, so, uh, I, we would do shit like that as a kid.  I remember, uh, one of the greatest things we ever found behind, uh, a store, I guess  they replaced all the fluorescent light bulbs and it was just a pile of them.  So we all grabbed a bunch squared off and we're heaving them at each other.  Oh.  And when they hit, it was fantastic.  It made a nice pop.  You got the smoke.  It just looked great.  Yeah.  It's an explosion.  So we were just winging these things at each other and laughing our asses off. 
[03:20:00]  Of course.  I mean, thank God no one got the, uh, little, a sliver of glass in the eye or impaled through  the chest with a shard.  There's kids now home listening from starting their summer vacation, writing all this shit  down.  Yeah.  I saw a bunch of fluorescent bulbs.  Let's do what Anthony did.  And now you're going to be sued.  Yeah, I'll get sued.  I'll have to sue the fluorescent light bulb maker to try to make up for what I lost in  the suit.  Ah, ridiculous.  Well, Mike Baker, this was a pleasure.  Mike, always, uh, just a blast to have you on, man.  You guys got the best show. 
[03:20:30]  I really love the opportunity to come on and thank you for letting me rant every now  and then.  You're a blast here.  And I'm glad we twisted it a little bit today and talked about other stuff.  Yeah.  We always do.  Yeah.  I hope when I come back next week, we can talk more about shit.  Whatever you want.  Literally shit.  About literally shit.  I'm going to go home.  I'm going to talk tomorrow.  I'm going to ask her if giving birth, uh, is, is anything like having sex and, and then  I'll come back and I'll report.  Yeah.  Let me know.  Uh, yeah, we would love to know that.  Well, the president of diligence.  Yes.  Diligence.com.  For all your security needs. 
[03:21:00]  Around the world.  Regardless where you are in this, uh, wonderful globe of ours.  It's a very dangerous globe.  Sure is.  So you need people like Mike around.  It is.  Just check us out.  We're out there.  If you need information, intelligence, security, give us a call.  I sound like such a schmuck when I try to sell.  Yeah.  Um, anyway, but thanks very much, guys.  I really, and happy 4th of July coming up.  Yes.  Yes.  Exactly.  Also thanks, uh, to Brother Weez and his poop stories.  They were great.  I think, I think he's Brother Weez on Twitter, I believe.  I think that's him.  All right.  Or is it Bro Weez?  I've tried Brother Weez. 
[03:21:30]  Bro Weez?  I think it's Brother Weez.  He'll find him.  He doesn't tweet as much as he should.  And, uh, what else?  Is that it?  I think we are done.  I feel like we've got something else to say.  Oh, wait, Sam?  What?  What?  Do you want to end with this or no?  Yeah, let's do that.  Oh, that was a good one.  Uh, Jim Brewer on Neighborhood Fireworks.  Yes.  Yeah.  Yes, this is perfect.  What a classic this is.  See you guys tomorrow.  Sorry about the app.  I guess the app fucking...  Oh, again.  ...went down for a lot of people.  They're bitching about it again.  But I don't know what to tell you people anymore.  I can just say I'm sorry. 
[03:22:00]  Here's Brewer for the people that still get us.  You know what we learned, uh, today?  Part of it.  A little early.  But, uh, we learned that there's now a third live read that people are going to be requesting.  Jim Brewer killing for us today.  Oh, you guys rock.  You make our job very easy.  Just turn on the mic and let Brewer go.  Oh.  Even...  Uh, JJ.  JJ.  Yeah, that was the funniest effing thing on New York radio ever.  What?  My sides are killing me now.  What?  The dog and the choking and... 
[03:22:30]  Uh, everybody had an old bra like that.  We used to call her Bagger in our town.  Bagger?  Yeah.  It was a funny thing.  Brewer ruled.  Screw that hook-nosed Jew.  Oh, my God.  I don't know what he's talking about.  Of course, he's referring to, uh, Ben Stein.  Ben Stein.  From Win Ben Stein's Money.  Yeah.  Yeah.  In my neighborhood, we used to throw rocks at that lady.  Yeah, who didn't?  And Halloween was just like, torture her night.  Yeah.  We had, uh, we had, um, this one German shepherd dog, and he lived this one house, and he, they 
[03:23:00]  always leave him out, and he'd drive us nuts, and on 4th of July, you know, bottle rockets  right at him.  You get the drunk guy with the Roman candles.  Where's the effing dog?  You can't feel the paint.  You can't feel the sparks.  Only the drunk dudes would grab the Roman candle.  Grab the Roman candle.  Everybody else, you can't feel it.  His face is blistering.  What did it say on the instructions?  Place on ground, light fuse, get away. 
[03:23:30]  You gotta shake it up.  You gotta shake it up.  Shake it up.  What do you got, fairies?  Come on.  Try it.  Hold it to one.  You know, I saw a Roman candle placed in the ground and lit, explode like a stick of friggin'  dynamite once.  And I'm thinking, oh my God, I'm always seeing people like you, Brewers says, holding these  ffft, ffft, ffft, ffft.  Come on.  Hold it.  And then you get like the retarded ffft, ffft, ffft, ffft.  It's like one's going up 100 feet.  The other one's dribbling out on the guy's knuckles. 
[03:24:00]  Open your head, dick.  You got my foot, dick.  Dick, give me the things.  You're done.  You're done.  Don't be a faggot.  Come on, man.  Then you had the idiot that would look into the tube because it didn't go off.  I thought there was another one in here.  Yeah, let me take a look.  Chief chinks can't even pack 10 in here anymore.  That was always the thing.  When I go in and say, done, you go, effing chinks.  Yeah, that was it.  Done.  Effing chinks. 
[03:24:30]  You light off like a pack of firecrackers, and half of it would go off.  The other was strewn over with no fuses.  The chinks.  Freaking chinks.  They can't get it right.  Once a year, we want to have fun with these things.  The freaking chinks.  The spears.  It's the chinks.  They want it that way.  Give me money, and they give us crap.  We just got to light them individually.  Give me your punk.  I remember trying to light firecrackers with a sparkler, and you can't tell if they're lit.  Yeah, yeah.  Because it's all sparkling together.  Right up until it went in my hand, I was like, oh, my God. 
[03:25:00]  I can't feel my hand.  It was totally numb.  There's always one guy that spent like $40 on one.  Yeah, one thing.  Yo, let me see that one you got.  That one you got.  Hold on.  I'll go get it.  $40.  Don't tell my mother, man.  Oh, my God.  What's the joke?  That's the thing, dude.  I don't even know.  All I know is that it's serious crap.  It's like a Buick with a fuse in it.  Look, it's got wings.  You got to put it together. 
[03:25:30]  You got to put it together.  That's all I need to say.  You got to put it together.  My brother came home from the Army.  He had his Army buddies visit him about a year or so later.  And they brought some goodies with him.  One was an M1 tank simulator.  This thing simulated the blast of a tank shell hitting the ground.  What?  Without the shrapnel and whatnot.  Yes, this is unbelievable.  So it was a green canister with some military writing on it that unscrewed and had a couple 
[03:26:00]  of contacts inside.  So I'm like, oh, let me go to the hardware store.  I'll grab some wire and a dry cell battery.  We'll go out to the John Glenn field out there.  And we'll set this booger off, you know?  So I put it in the field.  I had like 50 feet of wire.  And you never realize how short 50 feet is until it's the only distance between you and  something that explodes.  So I unroll it.  And I'm looking.  I go, okay, well, it's a little closer than I would like to be. 
[03:26:30]  But there's no shrapnel, you know?  So I'll attach one wire to the positive side of the dry cell.  I'll hook the other wire.  And then throw it on the contact and run away.  So by the time the igniter heats up or something, for that long haul the electricity's got to  make down 50 feet, oh, that could take nanoseconds.  Gives me more than enough time to run.  To spin away.  Right.  Yeah.  No sooner did that wire brush the contact than I just saw a white light and got blown back 
[03:27:00]  where the ground wasn't even under my feet anymore.  Like, you can't see it because it's radio.  I'm sorry.  But for you guys, I was like this in midair.  Like, my arms are straight out, my legs straight out, and I'm flying backwards.  I land on my ass.  And now the flash was so bright, I heard my pupils slam shut.  They were like, thwock, thwock.  And I couldn't see.  So I'm feeling myself, feeling, okay, fingers good. 
[03:27:30]  Fingers there.  I'm feeling everything.  I swear to you, not a mark on me.  But the concussion from this thing, because there was no shrapnel.  Everything was right there contained.  No metal hitting me.  But the blast, the frigging shockwave, it reminded me of those scenes you see on Discovery of  the house from the A-bomb, getting blown one way, and the trees snapping.  I swear, I got blown like 10 feet right on my ass.  I felt like the coyote.  It really did, man.  I knew how it felt. 
[03:28:00]  And then afterwards, when you realize you're okay, it's like, dude, was that the coolest?  I thought I was dead.  But now that I'm not, how cool is that?  Right.  That's funny.  Really, really sick.  All right.  Why'd they make it illegal?  Yeah, right?  It used to be so much fun.  John.  Yeah.  What's up?  Make my own pipe bomb.  Who on Long Island didn't have a buddy that made his own pipe bomb? 
[03:28:30]  I got a bunch of M-80s, we'll just hollow out the side with a screwdriver, dump them in  the pipe.  You get all the duds in the next day.  Duds?  Yeah.  We'll make a genie.  Step on it, it explodes.  You get the lit genie and step on it in mid-sparkling.  Did you see it turn pink?  Did you see the pink color?  Dax has got the best genie.  Case closed.  It's over.  Might have pink in it, dick.  Fuck. 
[03:29:00]  The Opie and Anthony show is pretty much over.  Pretty much over.  Pretty much over.  But if you feel like sticking around after 1A Live is next.  Yes.  Yes.  Yes.  Yes. </pre>
