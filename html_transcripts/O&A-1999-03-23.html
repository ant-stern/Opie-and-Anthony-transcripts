<pre> The Rock of New York, 1027 WNEW, two for Tuesday with you too, even better than the real thing  and with or without you.  It's Opie and Anthony and no we did not get fired.  No we're back, we're back.  We're back.  I'm reading these emails and people concerned, Opie, that for our hijinks on Friday that  we may have been terminated here to NEW but no.  No.  We are indeed here.  We just took the day yesterday.  Yeah, that's what we're telling people.  Thanks for Tony Pegg for sitting in on our show on Monday. 
[00:30]
 And thanks for management understanding our concerns.  Okay.  Well, at least if you missed Friday's show you could pop up the pictures on the website  and oh that's right, they're not there anymore.  Hmm, that's interesting.  I wonder if the two events are related.  Hmm, let's see.  People are making, they're starting their own conspiracy theories.  The website was gone and we were gone from the radio yesterday.  That's interesting. 
[01:00]
 Let's pop up, because a little page comes up when you go to our website to see the pictures  of maybe a black girl being whipped by the dominatrix or you want to see the Mentos video  which was just so popular, people love that.  Or the pictures of Tara again if you would miss them.  The blonde chick.  Well, let's look.  Hmm.  Oh, the website you're seeking cannot be found.  There are multiple reasons.  Well, let's run through these and see if maybe one fits. 
[01:30]
 Okay.  You may have mistyped the URL.  They are complicated sometimes.  You can mistype them, but I was using a favorite link.  So it wasn't that I typed the name in.  And you just click on the icon so I don't think people...  Yeah.  Yeah.  The site could be under construction.  Please try back later.  No.  No, I don't think that fits.  Considering if you saw the website before we got kicked off there was not much construction  ever going on.  Right.  The site account may have been moved or no longer exists.  No, it's still there. 
[02:00]
 Trust me.  I know where I put the stuff.  Hmm.  The site may have been removed due to violating our accepted uses and policy standards.  Well, now that might be it.  Let's click on that link and see what their policy is.  Okay.  All right.  Unlawful activity such as unauthorized distribution or copying of copyrighted photos.  No.  No.  We took those.  Copyrighted software.  No.  No.  Export restrictions. 
[02:30]
 No.  Fraud.  No.  Solicitation of gambling or prostitution.  Not really.  Not that I know of.  Okay.  Practices which may be considered obscene and or illegal material.  Whoops.  Hey!  There it is.  Winner!  Winner!  I know it was in there.  The people at WebJump have deemed our material obscene, Opi.  The fine people of WebJump.  Something the Supreme Court of our United States of America cannot even define obscenity, 
[03:00]
 but they have seen it as obscene.  They have decided our stuff is obscene, Anthony.  So now we're looking for another provider at this point in time.  Why can't I find a land for my material to rest in peace?  My God!  We traveled journey together on this Internet just looking for a homeland that will accept  us.  Let my pornography stay! 
[03:30]
 Damn you, WebJump!  So here we are.  Our journey continues for a homeland.  Why damn you?  Why can't I put my smut on a website?  I hate you!  I'm a clipper for that horse.  I'm a sucker for that horse.  I hate you!  I hate you!  I hate you for that horse having sex with a girl too.  They won't let that on there either.  Damn them all to hell!  We will journey through the desert trying to find a website that will accept us for 
[04:00]
 what we are.  Perfect!  Damn you!  Well, there we go.  That's six or seven sites we've been kicked off on.  I believe that would be six.  And our own, on any W site won't even let us on there.  No, they won't even acknowledge us at this point.  The search continues for a server. 
[04:30]
 I'm trying here people.  So it may be a few days.  We'll find someone new.  We'll get something.  Don't worry.  They'll be back.  All right.  Well, that's a nice little start to the program.  Well, there you go.  We're off.  We've got the boss in the studio but if we put him on mic we're going to have to ask  him some hard questions so we'll let him sit there.  Oh yes.  Unless he wants to take a mic.  You were quoted in the daily news today, boss.  Did you see that?  I like his answer.  It wasn't a quote.  His answer is, oh, it wasn't a quote.  It was him saying that. 
[05:00]
 We don't comment on rumors.  We don't comment on rumors.  Short, concise.  I like it.  To the point.  Did you have him whacked after he asked you such an insulting, disrespectful question?  We actually never talked.  You didn't?  No.  So how did he get that?  He said he wanted to talk to me.  I left him a voicemail message back saying there's no reason to talk to me but if you  want a quote to put in your column, my quote would be.  Oh, I see.  Hey, this is all about this whole thing about N.E.W. just flipping formats for some reason. 
[05:30]
 Now it's rumored that it's going to be a talk station.  I don't know.  I haven't heard anything but I am disturbed by something I read in that daily news thing,  boss.  What's that?  Did you read it?  Yes.  Did you read what was said in our private meetings?  Did you read that?  I want him dead!  We got it right.  I want him whacked!  How do you do this?  How do you handle this?  Luca Brasi?  You know what?  Who are you going to get?  We got to whack this guy. 
[06:00]
 You round up the usual suspects and you question them.  Who is it?  I think this person should be made an example.  You know, like, all right, grab the cannolis.  And you know what?  Not that the things we talk about are like ultra top secret but what good could possibly  come from talking to the newspapers about things that go on in our staff meeting?  Exactly.  Now where do you think the rumors start?  The rumors start from other radio stations.  Yes.  That are just trying to cause tumult.  Right, Godfather.  So who needs that?  You are right. 
[06:30]
 You are right, Godfather Don Herman.  We are behind you all the way and we will find this traitor who in the paper is letting  out family secrets.  I don't like this.  So how are you going to find them?  Oh, I think it's the person that is going to arrange security for our next meeting.  Tessio, that bastard.  He was always the smart one.  It's strictly business.  I understand this but we can't let these people off the hook.  I want him whacked.  See, usually it's the person that comes to ask you about the format change that was the 
[07:00]
 one that leaked it.  Oh, who came?  Who came to you?  Oh, everyone.  All right, all right.  We will have to track this person down though and Don Herman, we will bring him to you and  you will administer your justice as you do with your baseball bat up in your office.  I want his head cracked open.  We cannot have a family business spilled about the papers in this fashion.  Thank you.  So are we going all talk?  Is that the whole op?  Don't go to him with the question, oh my God, we're going to have to be like Fredo. 
[07:30]
 Is that the rumor?  Yeah.  Do we have your permission to turn our show into a talk show?  That would be fun.  Well, what do you think we're doing?  This is pretty much whether they like it or not, we've already made that decision.  We've been on the air 23 minutes.  It's the Godfather theme.  Well today we played four records already.  Sounds like it doesn't matter what I think.  It sounds like you've already made it to the talk station.  Maybe that's where the rumors start.  Yeah, really, they're listening to the op and Anthony show going, I never hear music. 
[08:00]
 I think the rumor started with Steve Mason and you guys.  You think so?  Oh, we're conjuring this up.  Interesting, interesting.  We got website providers on the line.  Oh good, get them.  Tell them I don't want to sign anything.  I don't want this wacky, if you use 100 gigs then you pay.  I want a password, I want a username and I want megs of storage space. 
[08:30]
 Unlimited bandwidth.  It sounds like a lot, but trust me, I will pop a banner on your stupid site.  We'll take care of you.  I need space.  I need speed.  I need unlimited bandwidth.  I need prostitutes.  You want to take a break I guess?  Oh yeah, you can play music.  Well it is due for Tuesday.  Oh that's right, we've talked twice as long as we usually do.  Why do you say it like that?  That's what puts the rumor.  That's what prolongs the rumor.  He didn't sound enthusiastic.  Well I'm enthusiastic because there's only a few of these left. 
[09:00]
 Oh, check please.  Wow, we can at least see the end, the light at the end of the tunnel.  Sound enthusiastic.  The Rock of New York, 1027 WNEW, due for Tuesday, Creed.  That's one.  My Own Prison before that, their debut CD.  Hey, it's Opie, it's Anthony.  Wow. 
[09:30]
 And no, we did not get fired, we just took a day off yesterday.  Yes, we are back.  We are back.  We've got to talk to Earl.  Maybe not this break, maybe later on in the show because we haven't seen him since he  got punished with all those nasty pictures.  When did the website actually throw the pictures off?  Was it over the weekend or today?  If you're just tuning in, we have a lot of pretty rude pictures under the semi-live studio  cam of our section of the WNEW website and we just got thrown off our sixth server because 
[10:00]
 of the content of our pictures.  That being pictures of Earl getting disciplined by Spike.  His hands were tied, he was gagged.  There were things in his face that shouldn't be in his face.  Yes, she had something, an apparatus strapped on, let's just say.  Yes, she had high heels on, she was gouging them into his groin area.  Pretty sick.  Some of the best pictures I've ever seen. 
[10:30]
 Yes, really good.  I checked yesterday afternoon and they were gone.  They were gone yesterday afternoon?  Oh, yes.  They may have been gone by Sunday or Saturday.  God damn.  So we're looking for a server now.  We've gotten some leads so hopefully I'll have these pictures back up later today or tonight.  We need a site by Friday because I think a couple of girls are taking on towers, the  hottest girls to ever be naked on the Opie and Anthony show.  Friday?  Yes, we need some web space by Friday. 
[11:00]
 Hi, N.E.W.  Hello?  Hi, what's going on?  Hi, what's up?  I heard you guys need a new web app provider.  Yes, but this is boring for the radio so hold on.  All right.  Just get his name and number, man.  Hi, N.E.W.  Yellow.  Hi, N.E.W.  Yes, they were still there at 5.30 last night.  Oh, they were?  Yes, they were.  That's about when I checked.  They were still there.  They were there Saturday night and Friday night because I checked Friday. 
[11:30]
 I heard it from Upstate New York, the broadcast, and I checked it Friday night.  So they threw it off last night or sometime.  Probably last night or from last night to this morning.  That's okay.  That means we got three good days out of it.  Yes, I wasn't expecting much more than that to tell you the truth.  They were pretty good.  I think between the...  Very explicit.  I think between the Earl getting disciplined and then the Mentos video, I think, really  put it over the top.  That was a little explicit.  It took a long time to download.  Yes, it was a big file.  Yes, we've got to get a faster server.  Yes, a faster server.  That should just pop right up. 
[12:00]
 Is it the host or is it the receiver when they try to download it?  I think it's the host if I had to guess.  Yes, it wasn't really.  I'm not great on that kind of stuff, but it took a while.  I did other things around the house while I think came out.  No, see, that should never be the case.  I mean, there are servers out there.  If you clicked on that Mentos file, it should have taken, what, a minute tops.  No, I think it took over 10, 15 minutes for me.  No, really.  We need a faster server.  Yes, I think it took a while.  I think it took a while.  I think it took a while.  I think it took a while.  all right gonna 
[12:30]
 thanks no problem I  I just wanted to say that those pictures weren't so great to begin with.  Really?  Spike isn't that great looking.  Spike?  Yeah.  No, you've got to understand.  She's hot in the dominatrix kind of way.  You know, okay, in that way I can tell.  Yeah, we're not looking for a Playboy model.  She was all about discipline and chains and whips and tattoos. 
[13:00]
 Yeah, but you know, you could have got somebody much better looking.  I don't know.  As far as dominatrix go, I think we were right on top of it.  Spike works, man.  Maybe Tara doing the dominatrix thing might have worked.  But see, Tara's like the girl next door.  That's what her looks all about.  And Spike is all about scars and scabs.  Spike's the real deal.  And being gnarly and stuff.  You know, her boobs weren't the same size.  I noticed that.  The one boob was a little bigger than the other.  Yeah, I didn't like that.  Oh boy, but who cares? 
[13:30]
 Geez, I guess Miss Perfect here wants to come in here and pose.  No.  No, what we could do.  We could have a dominatrix beauty pageant.  Oh, I have an idea.  With a little talent portion.  Yeah.  What do you think?  Maybe.  I mean, calling all dominatrix.  I mean, the publicity you would.  Well, maybe their boobs would be the same size.  I would, I don't know.  I would put my money on Spike on a dominatrix beauty contest.  What about the blue eyeshadow? 
[14:00]
 That's what I mean.  She's all about looking like.  The look.  Yeah, she's all, you know, scabbed up and stuff.  You're not in the scene, so you don't know what it's about.  Well, you know, we're in the scene.  And no, I don't, you know, maybe the top, you know, with the sock that Tara was wearing,  maybe that would have helped Spike a little bit.  No, we're in it.  You're in it.  Yeah, we go down to the seedy clubs.  Yeah.  Well, anybody could be in it.  All right, wait, what do you look for in a dominatrix?  Well, I...  You're not going to get a really like hot playboy model that pulls off the whole dominatrix 
[14:30]
 angle.  They could dress up in the dominatrix gear, but it's just not the same.  They're working in the Fredrick of Hollywood.  They're not going to be able to do it, though.  Yeah, you...  She cracks the whip.  We work in Fredrick, you know?  She cracks the whip.  She has strap on.  So you'll get a girl that's all hot dressed up in this lingerie with a whip going like,  dude, you want me to tap?  No, you need the real deal.  Spike's real.  I mean, there's a chance you're going to get hurt when you're with Spike.  Yeah.  All right.  It's not about, you know, fake S&M. 
[15:00]
 She's the real deal.  I'm sure there are people out there who are into this that are decent.  Let me tell you something.  No.  Actually, there aren't.  Let me tell you something about Spike.  She gets like $200 an hour to do that.  She's got like... on Friday night, she was with a pretty serious TV producer that's in  his sixties that likes to dress up as a girl.  Spike disciplines him.  She dressed him up in a little girl dress.  She's the real deal.  It's not about, you know, let's get a little wild on a Friday night, honey.  This lady makes her living.  Well, yeah. 
[15:30]
 And I find her attractive.  You do?  I do.  There's something very attractive about her.  What is it?  I don't know what it is.  There's just something about her.  First of all, her body is definitely not bad.  Yeah, I like her bod.  And even if you get past that makeup and stuff...  I mean, guys...  I've seen a lot worse boobs.  She's a dirty girl.  She's a very dirty girl.  That's attractive.  You know, we can all fit the role sometimes.  You must be really hot because you're picky.  Are you hot?  No.  Then why are you so picky? 
[16:00]
 I'm not picky.  I'm just saying if you're going to put pictures on the internet, let's have some night, you  could go to like playboy.com and get that crap.  We're showing the real deal.  The real deal.  The stuff that gets kicked off of six consecutive web servers.  We're proud of it.  Yeah, scabs and all.  I mean, she had...  I mean, Spike had hickeys and bruises all over her body, man.  She was all roughed up.  You could punch up pictures of hot girls on the web at the drop of a hat.  Put in hot girls and everything will come up. 
[16:30]
 This offers something that's a little different.  The stuff that gets banned.  I mean, it's your opinion.  I respect that.  But I could take an hour of calls from guys at all.  I just would love to be with Spike for an hour.  You know what?  You guys have a little twisted...  I don't know.  You're into the not so pretty looking girl.  Even that girl with the blonde hair that was on the pictures.  The little spinner.  She was ugly too.  Come on.  She was not ugly.  She was like a little dirty girl.  What?  The Gwen Stefani lookalike? 
[17:00]
 Yeah.  She's not ugly.  What was with the hairdo?  She wasn't ugly.  Come on.  I've seen the hotter girls but I would stick her in the bed.  I think you guys just have different tastes.  Your tastes are not the norm.  I don't know.  I also like to look at a real hot model and stuff.  It's all what you're into.  It's all taste.  Okay.  You know?  All right.  Obi, you're kind of cute too.  All right guys.  I've got to go.  Well send a picture.  All right.  I'll send a picture.  All right. 
[17:30]
 Thank you.  Okay.  Bye.  The blonde girl's hair kind of did have that Sally from...  Who's that?  Sally Hansen from Davy and Goliath.  Oh my God.  Davy's sister.  Davy Hansen's sister Sally.  Remember her hair?  It looked like the blonde thing but two yodels on the side.  It was like those around...  Even as a kid I'm watching going, hey damn it.  That looked like a couple of yodels. 
[18:00]
 What do you think, man?  Dominatrix beauty contest.  Yeah.  I like it.  You line up the Dominatrix.  And beauty is just a word when we use it in that fashion.  All sizes and shapes.  I know there's a lot of Dominatrix women that listen to us.  They come in with their little get up and we'll have the listeners vote who's the hottest  Dominatrix.  Who's the hottest Dominatrix.  Or someone will crown the hardcore champion as someone said on Friday.  Hardcore champion of the world.  Yeah we could do that.  That's Spike's title officially. 
[18:30]
 Yeah she's the hardcore champion.  The WWF terms tariff is the hottest girl to ever pose naked on the Open Anthony show and  Spike is the hardcore champion of the world.  We need our intercontinental and European champions.  And the belt will just change hands every day.  All right.  You want to play some more music?  No.  Oh yeah.  We got until they flip so what's up?  Now you're confirming rumors, Opie.  These are rumors.  The bosses are going to great lengths to say these are indeed just rumors. 
[19:00]
 It started by other stations, people in the business.  NW has not made any decisions as far as changing any formats.  I don't know what you're saying.  You heard the boss say he's not commenting on rumors.  Well we asked him and he didn't give us an answer.  No he didn't.  I found that a little suspicious.  Look into it man.  We're not that dumb.  Hey come on.  So all right we'll play a couple tunes.  What the hell?  For a goof huh?  For a goof. 
[19:30]
 We'll play a couple of tunes for a goof.  I understand.  We'll play a tasty cut.  Yeah.  From Pink Floyd.  We'll get a Pink Floyd song out of the way that you've heard a million times and then  one you've only heard a couple.  Is this the MDA telethon all of a sudden?  It sounded like a close encounter.  All right.  The Rock of New York 1027.  WNEW 2 for Tuesday.  Pink Floyd for metal. 
[20:00]
 That's fearless.  And Run Like Hell before that.  It's Opie and Anthony.  Thanks for checking us out today.  Appreciate it.  All right.  Brittany's.  What's her name?  Britney Spear?  Yeah.  Britney Spear is on MTV right now.  Yeah.  Let me look.  Oh yeah.  I liked her better when she was called Debbie Gibson.  I think so.  Yeah.  I think you're right there.  Pretty much.  Did anyone else see the God darn it.  I knew I forgot something today.  What? 
[20:30]
 We were goofing on Jesse from MTV.  Oh yeah.  Yeah.  Did you see the commercial?  They're running every like two minutes on MTV.  Yes, I have.  How if he if he could be a VJ anyone can.  Yeah.  Damn.  We need that audio.  That would be a VJ.  Very cool.  I get as you got a good concert.  Very cool being stupid.  Is there running a contest again looking for another VJ?  Yeah.  This time I'm convinced they're just going to get a rock.  Just get a big dopey rock, put it somewhere and put like VJ rock underneath it. 
[21:00]
 And then they'll just show it and then go to a video.  Yeah.  It would be less annoying than that stupid Jesse.  And then just put the VJ rock on tour and people would come out to see the VJ rock.  You are so right.  They could make the rock famous.  So when people see a rock it'll be like well that's not the rock.  That's not the rock.  And when they bring the VJ rock to your city you like stand on line.  Of course you would.  Dude that's the rock.  Get a picture of me with the rock.  They should do that.  That's better than Jesse. 
[21:30]
 I'm a VJ.  I'm a VJ.  Goody goody goo.  We got to roll tape on MTV because they will run the spot.  They've been playing it every two seconds.  Every two seconds.  What was the question?  But that's how pathetic our society is as far as fame and stuff goes.  If we put a rock on TV long enough and then you put the rock at a bookstore people would  line up to get a picture with the rock.  With the rock.  MTV rocks with the rock on spring break and have the rock with a bunch of chicks and bikinis. 
[22:00]
 And it's all special.  The rock's spring break special.  And there's no sound.  It's just the rock.  It's just the rock to check out.  And chicks.  And chicks.  You'd watch.  Of course you would.  More than I would Jesse because then I'd turn it off.  Hey we have spring break.  It's very cool.  I got the intelligence of a six year old.  And we have spring break.  Why is it so great?  We're going to lose capacity.  Click.  Click.  Click.  I cannot change the frigging channel faster. 
[22:30]
 I don't care if there's twenty naked chicks behind them.  I can't get past.  You think how much sperm you think it takes to get his hair like that?  Hey you want to throw another batch of it?  There's something about Mary in his head.  We got to get the audio of Jesse.  Someone roll tape on MTV.  And then we'll put it on the air and then we'll go find it for another twenty minutes.  You could be a VJ too. 
[23:00]
 You cut out his brain.  You bastards.  Alright Anthony stacker two.  You need a boost of energy?  You alright man?  Yeah I'm on stacker two.  He has energy.  Look at him go.  Wow.  Now you've taken this.  I took it today.  And it gives you the energy you need to make it through the day.  Yeah it's helping me.  It is. 
[23:30]
 Gives me a nice little boost of energy just in time for the show.  That's good.  And there you have it.  It also says it burns fat Anthony.  I guess if you're getting tired during the day, stacker two would be for you.  If you're looking for an energy boost you could try stacker two.  If you're not happy they'll give you your money back.  The company is in New Jersey.  You pop a pill within an hour you get a boost of energy.  And to order it you could call 1-800-LIGHTLINE.  The Rock of New York 1027 WNEW.  Two for Tuesday, Aerosmith. 
[24:00]
 Dude looks like a lady and Dream On.  Those guys at the Oscars the other night.  That is weird huh?  Yeah.  It was very strange.  I think they're kind of fitting into that whole thing these days.  I don't know.  Steven Tyler looked like he fit in with the Oscars.  I mean that way.  I mean just with the age bracket of the people that are there.  All that whole pomp and circumstance hoity toity up stuck up people.  I don't know.  He's a, I don't know, I think he's getting fitting into that category these days. 
[24:30]
 Like a sellout?  That damn soundtrack man to the Armageddon.  I don't know.  NEW.  Hey yo you guys know that that Aerosmith song they played on the Oscars was written about  Barbra Streisand and James Brolin man?  I don't want to miss a thing?  Yeah.  That's actually James Brolin looking at Barbra Streisand sleeping man.  I remember that whole thing. 
[25:00]
 Yeah.  I mean you know Opie said that Aerosmith is a rock band.  There ain't no rock band anymore.  Not anymore.  Did you check out Joe Perry's hair?  Yeah.  Oh my God.  What's going on there?  I mean you know I must say I love Aerosmith but he's got to do something with that hair.  I wonder how many guys have been hitting on him lately with their hairdo.  No doubt.  Hey you guys are great man.  At least he chopped off that weird fool man chew thing he had going on. 
[25:30]
 I don't know what it was.  It was like the Hitler mustache was backwards.  Yeah he shaved out the middle.  Shaved out the middle and had the rest.  Hey wait a minute.  I want to know is that really what that's about?  Yes.  Now who wrote that?  You know I don't know her name.  It's not coming to me right now but I saw it on a barbershop.  Oh no.  Overwater.  Walters.  Yeah I remember this.  James Brolin was saying, James Brolin, James Streisand.  Talk about the biggest pussy whip on the face of the earth. 
[26:00]
 What normal man looks at a freaking woman after he does her?  He's asleep man.  Well no he said that he looked at her one day and didn't want to go to sleep.  He goes I don't want to go to sleep and Barbara goes why don't you want to go to sleep?  And that's what the song is about.  And he said because I don't want to miss a thing.  Yeah I'll miss you and I don't want to miss looking at you while my eyes are closed.  Jesus.  Oh.  Barbara Streisand you're bedding down with not Pamela Lee. 
[26:30]
 I know right.  She's not even good to look at awake anyway.  You know remember the young James Brolin you just figured you know he was a cool guy back  in the 70s even.  What Marcus Welby he was on.  Tough guy man.  Tough guy.  He could get any chick he wanted.  And then he's a Barbara I don't want to shut my eyes because I'll miss you sweethearts.  And that's what that song is about.  That's what that song is about.  Ah make me puke.  I can't listen to that phone anymore I want to punch the radio man. 
[27:00]
 Ah well what do you think of the Oscars?  I really don't watch that stuff but I actually sat with my wife and watched it and I don't  know I almost threw something at the TV man.  I can't take it.  You know we got into a big fight and stuff and she went running upstairs.  Wow on the Oscar.  I just watched on the sports channel you know.  It's so not real and not anything any of us can relate to these Hollywood big wig jackoffs  just parading around in their gowns and jewels. 
[27:30]
 Yeah but that's what women love that man.  It's a whole fashion show and stuff.  You know I'm not sick of Roberto Benigni yet.  Oh God I can't take that guy anymore.  As an Italian I want him shot.  This is great.  Marvelous.  This is wonderful.  I can't believe you're America.  You love me.  I love everybody.  This is fabulous.  I can't.  Shut up.  Have you had enough of this guy?  You see that S eating grins. 
[28:00]
 I almost slipped.  Right.  That he had during the whole Oscar.  Yeah he's like an Italian retard walking around.  It looks like a retard that you just brought to the zoo and they just saw some animals.  Yeah yeah.  Happy and stuff.  That's what he is.  Look at me.  I just made a poopy in my pants.  Would you like to see the poopy in my pants?  And everyone's like the anchor doing the news comes back from the clips of the Oscars and 
[28:30]
 they're all laughing.  What spirit this man has.  Is he great?  He just he's so up all the time.  Who cares?  This is wonderful.  I cannot believe you American people love me.  This is fabulous.  How about the Robin Williams character though man.  If anything he said funny at all.  No no no.  It never was.  It's unbelievable man.  It never was.  We were all tricked.  Even Whoopi Goldberg.  I mean nothing she said was even close to funny.  Whoopi is not funny.  I don't think she ever has been. 
[29:00]
 And she proved that last night too.  Because I mean all she ever did was use like that her black slang thing and goof around  on the president.  And it's not Washington.  And then the next minute she talks like a white person.  Yeah.  White person.  Oh my goodness.  She's talking about the ebonics and the next minute she's talking like a white person.  Well I know what you're trying to say.  But they got a little upset.  A few of the executives at the station got upset because she was manipulating the microphone  at one point.  Like it was a penis.  Yeah when Liam Neeson was being introduced she was stroking the microphone like it was 
[29:30]
 a big slug.  Like Liam's going to want a piece of you.  Yeah like that's a vision we need to see.  Oh gosh she's got to wear baggy pants so her boobs can fit in her legs.  Those things are swinging.  What's that old joke?  What does Whoopi Goldberg giving you a Hummer and tightrope walking across the Grand Canyon  have in common?  What?  What?  In both you don't want to look down.  I love that guy.  There it is!  I got to get back to work. 
[30:00]
 Oh we're rolling tape.  Alright man take it easy.  Love you.  Yeah there it is.  The Jesse commercial just came on.  Good we have tape of it.  We have tape of it.  Get that on card immediately we got a goof on Jesse.  The spot they're running on MTV.  So there you go I don't know if there's anything else to talk about with the Oscars.  That was pretty lackluster, pretty boring.  There wasn't any.  Would you throw Sophia Loren one still or what?  No stop with Sophia Loren.  Everybody's saying how would a babe she is.  She's like a grandma.  She was like a great grandma.  I don't know man there was something going on there.  I don't know dude it's TV.  They cake stuff on.  They're pulling tugging.  I don't know.  Yeah you want to see that?  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know. 
[30:30]
 I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know. 
[31:00]
 I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know. 
[31:30]
 I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  All right.  I guess we'll take a break here. 
[32:00]
 We have the Jesse clip now.  You just got to hear how retarded they ... Weren't there talented people that actually wanted  to be VJs?  Well, honestly, there's a lot of kids, let's say, that are in broadcasting and they work  their ass off four or five years in college and they want to break in the business.  It's almost an embarrassment.  You turn on the tube, you're working your ass off and you see someone like Jesse on  MTV.  Yeah.  I understand.  of people that really want to do that would do a great job.  It's like the original Mercury astronauts, very qualified, highly trained, and they were 
[32:30]
 upset when they used to send the monkey up in the capsule.  It's the same thing.  They got a monkey running this job.  Pretty much.  Jesse, did you get it?  You want to hear a petty or the pumpkins?  Oh, golly, that's a nice pumpkin.  That's a good bear.  All right, good, New York, 1027WNEW, two for Tuesday, Smashing Pumpkins, Cherub Rock in  1979.  Hey, what we didn't touch on with the Oscars just before was the whole Lewinsky thing.  Yeah. 
[33:00]
 Like she went to all these parties.  She got in her big fat gown and went with Jonathan Marshall.  I guess he's some entertainment lawyer or something.  Yes, I'm sure he is.  And made the rounds of the parties.  That just goes to show you how screwed up this country is and how screwed up that whole  entertainment thing the Oscars are.  She is known for giving a hummer to the president, period.  That's it.  And now she's accepted by Hollywood's elite.  Hollywood's royal family. 
[33:30]
 She is at these parties.  Opi and I, we went to an Oscar party once.  Oh, we did, didn't we?  Yeah, remember?  Remember three or four years ago?  Remember that?  A radio station in Boston was kind enough to send us out to Los Angeles for the Oscars.  We interviewed a bunch of hacks.  stars.  So we figure, hey, there's the Oscar party at Spago.  We're going to Spago like everyone, like all the big Hollywood types, right? 
[34:00]
 Yeah, we figured we're in LA and we're on the radio.  We're pretty important.  We'll get into this party.  Spago!  So we cart our asses down to Spago where there's a line of geeks and freaks looking for celebrities.  We realized at this point, we are getting in.  Who are we?  But at least we found a little, a two by six board up on two cinder blocks that put us  a little higher than the crowd so we could gawk with the rest of the freaks.  Well, you got to explain too.  That was kind of like the press area sort of, Ant. 
[34:30]
 Sort of.  I didn't understand what it was.  There was some paparazzi up there and some reporters.  So we're like, hey, we're on the radio.  We got these groovy looking badges that look important.  Sure.  We'll go into the press area as well.  Maybe we'll get a couple questions out.  So we go from maybe having dinner with Madonna at Spago to, all right, we'll just stand on  this board.  And just watch the celebrities coming up.  Gawk at people, sure.  We're up there no longer than, I guess, a minute.  Some big guy comes up and goes, hey, you can't stand on that. 
[35:00]
 We got kicked off of the board in front of Spago.  We couldn't even stand on a two by six.  We weren't worthy enough to stand on a damn piece of what.  Madame Tonsil hockey gets into all the parties with a big, fat, glittery dress.  Yeah.  And he stains on it that night.  Monica, did Jonathan leave a stain?  You know what is more disgusting than all that? 
[35:30]
 Katie Lang is quoting the paper today that she told Monica that she had a sex dream about  her.  Sorry, Katie.  There seems to be something missing on your anatomy that she really likes.  Right.  Exactly.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Where's that?  Monica was seated under table 14.  That was, no, honestly, I'm not going to take credit for that.  Don't worry, because I know people heard it somewhere else.  That's Jay Leno's joke that he told a hundred people. 
[36:00]
 Every time you saw Jay Leno on TV, he was telling that same joke.  He was so proud.  Well, Monica, Monica Lewinsky, she's seated under table 14.  Isn't that funny?  Check, please.  Check, please.  What a buffoon.  Well, there you have it.  How about that Monica Lewinsky, people?  You know she was seated under table 14.  What a mess.  What do you got?  A little note?  Phone call?  I don't know. 
[36:30]
 Kevin, you've got to print, I think.  What is he writing in cursive?  Give me that.  Let me see.  Come on.  Get out of here.  Our intern is great.  He's a screen in the class.  Now read what it says.  Wait, wait.  He scribbled out the first two and you can't tell what he scribbled to what he wants you  to read because it looks like the scribble.  Fine in good mor- what?  To speak to- Oh, you have issues.  You have some problems.  N.A.W., what do you have? 
[37:00]
 You should go over to MTV so you can be a VJ.  Who is it?  My name is Dennis.  Hey, Dennis, what's up?  Just touching upon the Monica Lewinsky thing.  I was watching Good Morning America yesterday and one of the ladies was there and she said  she couldn't even get to Monica.  There was a huge line and supposedly Monica is hanging out with Madonna.  Yeah, you know, I'm not a huge Madonna fan but all of a sudden Madonna was kind of tossed  aside because Monica was there.  I think Madonna has done more for our society than- 
[37:30]
 Not much.  Than Monica.  That's how we think of this country, you know?  It's Monica.  Everyone wanted to see Monica and she's known for one thing, the presidential schween.  She has embraced it, loved it, serviced it and that's what's making her famous right  now.  They're taking pictures of her and meanwhile presidential penis is ready to launch missiles  into Yugoslavia.  This is great.  Is anybody interested in that maybe we're going insane as a country? 
[38:00]
 Maybe we're just insane now?  President is getting ready to shoot his load once again.  His load of missiles.  Yeah, his military load.  I will take my missile and thrust it right into Kosovo.  Kosovo, who's she?  I like them foreign broads.  When can I get some of that Kosovo?  Yeah, get some.  Well, you know his wife and daughter are out of the country. 
[38:30]
 That's what I hear.  Yes, Africa is it?  They're taking a little 12 day trip of Africa.  They've been over there a lot.  There's so many countries to visit on the globe and for some reason they went a while  back and now they're going again.  Now, interestingly enough, I think we have exclusive audio, Anthony.  I don't doubt it.  Why wouldn't we?  We got audio of Hillary and Chelsea in Africa.  I can't wait to hear it.  We'll be playing that a little later on in the show.  Also, where's Black Earl?  Where is he? 
[39:00]
 Where's Earl?  We've got to talk to him today.  He's rejoicing that his pictures, the pictures of him getting disciplined by Spike, were  kicked off the webpage.  Well, a lot of people are sending instant feedback saying, hey man, why don't you tell  your faithful listeners that you guys got censored again?  We talked about earlier in the show, we got censored by what?  Web Jump?  Web Jump was web dumped to me and they took our pictures off.  We read down the list of reasons that you might get dumped off of Web Jump and the only 
[39:30]
 one that fit was obscene material.  Yes.  They can judge what's obscene.  The Supreme Court still has not decided what obscene is.  Can't define it.  But Web Jump has realized that maybe that Mentos video was obscene.  That was classic.  I showed so many people that this weekend.  People like that one.  Big time.  Well, we're going to find another server, I guess, because that's the sixth one we've  been kicked off of.  Yes, seven's a charm.  So don't worry, we'll get the pictures back eventually.  Oh, they'll be back.  When we find a cool server.  Now, where's Earl?  Is he still in the building?  I think he's in the back. 
[40:00]
 All right, well, here's the deal.  Because we're running so late, let's just play a few spots and we'll come back hopefully  with Earl.  Okay.  Instead of music.  Is that cool?  Sounds good.  Can we handle that?  You're going to perpetuate these rumors, Zopie.  What's that, Anthony?  By not playing music.  What?  No one's talking about that.  I read something in the paper.  Huge article in the Daily News.  Rumor has it we're going all talk.  We had the boss on earlier and he didn't confirm or deny the rumor.  He's out right now looking to whack the staffers that spoke with the Daily News. 
[40:30]
 Yeah.  The boss will do that.  You'll find two people that worked here in the river.  Floating in the East River.  Well, we got a bunch of rats on the staff.  We know that already.  A bunch of rats going to the press talking about our private meetings, staff meetings.  That's just stupid.  All right, it's Zopie.  It's Anthony and it's our buddy, our pal, Earl.  Black Earl, everyone.  What's up, man?  What's happening?  Earl can't stay long.  He's very busy.  He's working very diligently today. 
[41:00]
 Well, everyone's getting ready for the Dave Matthews thing tomorrow.  Yes.  We have tickets to give away?  Yeah, we do.  We forgot to give away our tickets last hour.  Oh, we can do that.  We'll do that.  But Earl, I notice you're still standing.  You haven't sat down since Friday?  I'm in pretty good shape, actually.  Are you?  Yeah.  Are you sore at all this weekend from your beating from Spike?  A little sore in the groin area, but I'm fine.  She was stepping on him with high heels, Spike heels.  Yeah, are you sore from the high heels or from the, what was that?  I never used to like... 
[41:30]
 Well, don't get too happy.  Don't get yourself too attached to the current format.  We're teasing, of course.  No, all I'm saying is I like certain kinds of music.  This is the line you got to listen to when you're in a bar trying to pick up a chick.  You got to listen to these stories.  We're like the guy with the coke to the coke whore right now.  She'll say anything to us.  No, this wasn't.  Why?  New York has such an incredible music scene. 
[42:00]
 You know in the bar, you've got to sit and listen like, yeah.  Meanwhile, you're just going, God, I hope this pans out.  Yeah, because in your head you're thinking, man, I wonder what you're thinking.  So you act really interested.  Yeah, the music scene in New York.  Damn the music scene.  Yes, it does suck.  God, we are so much alike.  You know, we are so much alike.  I love puppies too.  I love puppies.  I love getting that.  I don't care what you think.  I love them.  I love them.  I travel thousands of miles with them. 
[42:30]
 Yes, yes, we know.  In London, in Amsterdam, and I've seen them here all over the country.  I want to see them tomorrow.  Yes, I put her on hold.  No, I agree.  Yes, the tampon much better than the pad.  Am I getting laid tonight?  Please, so I can finish this conversation.  She's probably freaked out because we put her on hold.  We're on delay.  Hold on.  Hello?  Hello?  Hi. 
[43:00]
 Hi, I thought we lost you there.  No, I'm listening.  You put me on the radio.  Oh, my God.  Look at her.  Now she's listening to herself.  Now she's back on hold.  Now, obviously, we didn't even ask her the question, but it's so obvious she's not going  to get it.  Right.  But now she's a huge Dave Matthews fan.  Hi, who's this?  Hi, my name's Jim.  Hi, Jim, how are you?  Good, good.  I'm calling. 
[43:30]
 This lady's so annoying, man.  No, really?  Can I ask you a question?  All right, look.  Isn't it?  It's just like every girl.  You try to pick up in a bar.  Yeah, man.  And you just got to put up with it.  You got to because you're trying.  You're working it.  Yeah.  No, I do understand.  Yes.  Yes.  No, tell me about how your father screwed you over again.  God, I love that.  Yeah, you're not.  I sympathize so much.  Oh, you poor thing.  If I could work up a tear, I'm in.  And inside your head, you have this hourglass, you know.  Yeah, and it's going down like your schween.  All right, so what's your deal with Dave Matthews?  Yeah, I think they're a great band.  Fans are going crazy.  I mean, they're going crazy.  I mean, they're going crazy. 
[44:00]
 I mean, they're going crazy.  I mean, they're going crazy.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah. 
[44:30]
 Yeah.  Hi.  Hi.  Hi.  Michael.  Hi, Michael.  Where are you calling from?  In my car in the northern state.  I just left Huntington.  How's the traffic?  It's not bad.  All right, cool.  You got an answer to the ONA trivia question?  I didn't hear the actual...  They were comparing Viagra to something.  Yeah, we did an analogy about Viagra when we first...  Oh, this is OV?  Yeah.  Hey, I went out to the Longshore Brewery a couple weeks ago.  Why not?  Right.  Good time.  You got an answer, dude, because your phone's crapping out on us.  Oh, you compared it to crack?  No.  All right, man.  We got to go. 
[45:00]
 Your phone sucks.  Okay, sorry.  All right.  All right, here's the deal.  Here's the deal.  Yeah.  We'll take two more callers.  Yeah.  If they know the answer, they get the tickets flat out.  If not, I'm going to give it to the huge day matthews.  I figured you would do that.  Is that cool?  That sounds okay.  All right.  She's looking a freak now.  Is someone getting...  Is he still listening?  Yeah.  Hi, NAW.  NAW.  Yeah.  All right, what's your name?  What is Mike?  All right, Mike, do you know the answer to the ONA trivia question?  I do.  I do.  I'm just listening. 
[45:30]
 I know.  I'm listening.  All right, we need an answer, dude.  All right.  Put the bong down.  Yeah.  It was.  My aggro was compared to...  He's just...  He's milking.  I do now.  I forgot.  I know.  All right.  Thanks.  All right.  It's compared to the thing that you guys once called a...  Oh, my God.  All right, this is the last one.  Hang on, man.  There's such a ding-dong.  All right, what's your name again?  You didn't know my name in the first place.  Oh, yeah.  What's your name?  Laura. 
[46:00]
 Laura the Annoying Caller.  Laura the Annoying Dave Matthews Caller.  You're going to regret that.  All right, Laura, here's the deal.  I'm putting you on hold.  Okay.  If the next person doesn't know the answer, then you got the tickets for this private show.  Dude, leave her on the line.  All right.  Let's let her live through this horror.  I'm so sorry, Laura.  I'm listening to the radio.  All right.  All right.  Stay on the line.  Hold on.  All right.  God, I hope he gets it.  I hope he gets it.  Laura?  Laura?  Yeah.  Okay, hold on.  Hold on.  All right.  All right.  All right. 
[46:30]
 Hold on, everyone.  It's like missing control over there.  We lost Houston.  All right.  When we go all talk, I hope they fix the phone.  All right, Laura.  Yeah.  All right.  Hold on.  I'm going to try this again.  All right.  All right.  Hi.  Who's this?  This is Kyle.  All right, Kyle.  Hold on.  What a pain in the ass. 
[47:00]
 All right, Laura.  Yeah.  Kyle.  Yeah.  All right, cool.  All right, Laura.  Shut up, all right?  I'm not saying anything.  All right.  I just want to say shut up.  Believe me, it was a preemptive shut up.  We knew it was coming.  Preemptive shut.  All right.  Go ahead.  Kyle, for the day, where are you calling from, Kyle?  Manhattan.  All right.  For the day, Matthew's ... Are you a big Opie and Anthony fan?  Huge.  Kind of hilarious.  And how long have you been listening?  About three, four months.  I see.  This could be good, then.  This could be good.  This could be good for the girl. 
[47:30]
 All right, Kyle.  What is the answer to the ONA trivia question?  We'll give it to you again.  When Viagra hit the scene in the summer, we made an analogy of what it was like.  Ecstasy?  No.  Oh, man.  Come on, guys.  I'm going all day.  Sorry, man.  Can't take two people.  Hello?  Laura.  Yeah?  You're going.  Look at her.  Listen to her.  She's squealing.  Yes.  Oh, yes.  Thank you.  Thank you.  To be honest, I wanted to give it to you from the beginning because you're a tool.  Too cool. 
[48:00]
 Stop trying.  What, are you trying to pick her up?  Yeah.  Come on, man.  Is she hot?  I got to know.  Wow.  She almost went from being real excited about Dave Matthews to having an orgasm.  I know.  I'm going to be like, oh, my God.  I'm going to be like, oh, my God.  I'm going to be like, oh, my God.  I'm going to be like, oh, my God.  I'm going to be like, oh, my God.  I'm going to be like, oh, my God. 
[48:30]
 I'm going to be like, oh, my God.  I'm going to be like, oh, my God.  I'm going to be like, oh, my God.  I'm going to be like, oh, my God.  I'm going to be like, oh, my God.  What's the station?  All right, listen, we got to do the big contest outro.  We got to do the tagline, you know, when like Z100 and all those go,  what's your favorite radio station?  I'm sorry.  My heart's beating so bad. 
[49:00]
 I'm so happy.  Laura, what's the radio station that wants to see your balloon knot?  WNEW.  Yeah.  How do we do this?  Hold on the line.  Okay.  Hopefully, I won't hang up on you.  And you got the text for Dave Matthews.  Thank you.  We'll see you tomorrow with Ralph Titor, all right?  All right.  Laura's on line five.  Wow.  That's cool.  I'm exhausted just listening to her.  Well, the Viagra analogy, it's good, but we got to take a break. 
[49:30]
 Yeah.  Maybe we'll do it a little later.  How's that?  Okay.  We'll fill you in on that.  Yeah.  You want to hear, wow, Pearl Jam or ACDC next?  It depends on the Pearl Jam.  I've heard some, like Pearl Jam is very iffy with me.  Sometimes I love it, but there are some songs I cannot sit through.  Jeremy and Nothing Man.  Those are pretty good.  ACDC, you shook me all night long or Money Talks?  I've heard those enough.  Really?  I've heard all four enough, to tell you the truth.  When we go all talk, you won't have to worry about it. 
[50:00]
 Stop perpetuating rumors.  Well, everyone else is talking about it in the city.  Let's make believe we don't know anything about it.  We're not supposed to talk about such things, Saltbite.  All right.  Pearl Jam or ACDC?  You said Pearl Jam?  Go with the Pearl Jam.  All right.  We'll be back.  All right.  We'll take a little musical break here.  On the way next, some audio from Hillary and Chelsea's trip to Africa.  It's an Opiate Anthony exclusive.  In the meantime, it's Two for Tuesday.  The Rock of New York, 1027 WNEW, Two for Tuesday with Pearl Jam, Nothing Man and Jeremy. 
[50:30]
 I just love hearing you say that.  What?  Two for Tuesday?  A two for everyone.  It's a two for this Tuesday, on this Two for Tuesday.  Care!  Hey, stop it.  You're not supposed to say things like that.  See, we're able to, with the two fors, get, you know, the second cut could be more of  a tastier cut, Saltbite. 
[51:00]
 Tasty Two for Tuesday cut for you.  Tasty tune on a tasty Two for Tuesday.  When are we going to start doing Black Party Weekends?  That's what I want to know.  Hey, get the let out.  Let's get the let out.  All right.  You know, I was a goof when I was working in Buffalo Radio, you know, because every  station was getting the let out.  That was the big thing.  Right.  Let's play three in a row from Led Zeppelin called Get the Let Out.  It'll be Zanerrific Radio.  I started a thing in Buffalo called Mandatory Metallica. 
[51:30]
 Mandatory Metallica?  That was you?  Yeah, that was me.  Ho-ho.  That's taken over the whole country.  I've heard that.  That's the latest.  So, all right.  Well, we could play the audio from Chelsea and Hillary.  Clinton, they're over there in Africa.  We've got some exclusive audio.  Okay.  Or we could go to the phones and talk to our drunk friend, Jay.  Jay's on the phone, huh?  Well, you hung out with Jay this weekend, right?  I was up in Massachusetts.  Yeah, hung out with Jay.  It's always a common theme when we're hanging out. 
[52:00]
 It's very funny.  We've got to explain Jay.  Anthony and I are very good friends off the air.  This is not like a little goof we do.  We act like we like each other on the radio and then hate each other like every other team in New York.  And we have one friend.  Yeah.  One friend.  We've known each other for five years.  We have one friend.  That's true.  And it's Drunken Jay.  Drunken Jay.  Drunken Jay.  He's not drunk now.  No, I'm not.  Thank you.  You make him sound like he's drunk all the time. 
[52:30]
 Thanks a lot.  I know.  Isn't that great?  It's so funny because when I hang out with Jay, we do athletic stuff.  That's true.  You do maybe some rollerblading.  Or we'll walk the streets and check out record stores and stuff.  Right.  Now when Anthony hangs out with Jay, it's just drinking and brunch and throwing darts  at things you're not supposed to throw darts at.  Yeah, the liver has to really get in tune before we hang out. 
[53:00]
 We're still doing sporting events, but they take on a whole new...  I don't know.  Well, this is a theme that is running through because since we've been back in New York,  I go up there to visit because my wife Jennifer's family still lives up there.  So we go on little outings.  The first one you may have remembered was the Renaissance Festival that I went on.  Now, so it wouldn't just be me and Jen and my mother-in-law and maybe Annie Marge, who 
[53:30]
 was at the original Renaissance.  So the festival was a whole new thing to her.  It was cold.  She told us it was accurate.  Yeah, it was a revival to her.  Oh, King Richard.  I did him.  So we went to that.  Well, we're drinking beer like crazy.  We were just like big steins.  We turned into those knights.  By the end of the day, we're tanked throwing hatchets at wood.  We're supposed to be at the wood.  Then we're just picking targets. 
[54:00]
 Bet you can't hit that tree.  I stand about six feet tall.  There was a tall girl right next to me and I missed bad.  I'm talking the hatchet just bounces off the wall.  This teenager who just handed me four hatchets while I put down two beers to get them.  Dude, why don't you like move back a step or two?  Now the hatchet is equal with her head and I whip it and it just goes right past her  ear. 
[54:30]
 But of course she had a few.  She was laughing too.  Everyone was laughing at the hatchets and the drunk people.  Now, you guys almost got kicked out of a bar on Sunday.  Well, you've got to remember now there was another time we visited where me and Jen and  Jay figured we'd go bowling.  But you can't find cool regular bowling up there.  So we had to do that fag candles pin bowling with a tiny ball.  The ball is like the size of a softball.  The pins are little candlesticks and you whip this ball down there.  So of course drinking. 
[55:00]
 Then at one point Jay bet me that he could take this candle pin ball, throw it down,  which is a regulation lane.  Same length.  Without hitting the lane, the ball will land in the center of the pins, thus scoring a strike.  I couldn't get the money out of my pocket fast enough to see this.  He shot puts this thing.  He gave it a little too much.  It hit the sign.  You know those big signs over the alleys that say like, you know, Junior League bowling 
[55:30]
 starts here?  He hit it like alphabet soup.  They're falling all over every other lane.  We started unlacing our shoes at that point.  We were out of there quicker than a chippy at one of Fredo's get-togethers.  Godfather reference.  We love Godfather references.  So now I'm up there this weekend.  So we decide to catch some brunch.  This is the Sunday tradition.  We go to this small place that has a little brunch and drinks that are made like, just don't smoke near them. 
[56:00]
 So what were you drinking?  You were drinking those vodka grapefruits.  They call it a grape greyhound.  But it's basically a big thing of vodka with some yellow food color.  I had some Bloody Marys and stuff.  Then we decided we'd hit the bar down the road to play some darts.  Wait, can I explain the bar?  Yeah.  Oh yeah, it's a bloodbath.  I've been there.  It's called Green Acres.  And this is a place that has all-out bar fights every weekend. 
[56:30]
 It's a small local place, but they need bouncers in the place because somebody will always be dragged out, kicking, punching.  It looks like one of those old Burt Reynolds movies every Friday night and Saturday night.  Just insane.  And on Monday they're replacing the panes of glass outside every single Monday.  I'm not exaggerating.  This place is just a sick bar.  Exactly.  People get kicked into this bar.  Now, the story goes, you guys went there Sunday. 
[57:00]
 Sunday after brunch.  You almost got kicked out of this bar.  Almost got kicked out.  No one gets kicked out of this bar.  Well, we're playing darts because that's what we went there for.  Oh, and yes, two to drink.  And the game of darts just didn't seem exciting enough, so we had to play it from the table we were sitting at across the room,  which still wasn't bad because we were trying to hit the dartboard.  Then it got to the point where Jay starts taking the chalk that you score with and making Xs on various things around the bar.  And we're betting a buck a shot who can get closest to his X. 
[57:30]
 So it's like the fire extinguisher.  Lap, lap, phoom, phoom, my buck.  You know, you hit the guy coming out of the bathroom.  Doesn't matter if he passed the extinguisher, has to hit the extinguisher.  It was a mess.  People were walking right by us.  The other one, though, hey, try to hit the outlet.  Yeah, yeah.  And you know what?  I was so bad off I just said, you know what?  There's no way I'm going to hit it anyway.  So I just threw it anyway.  And Jen was giving us looks like she was getting pissed. 
[58:00]
 And then the owner of the place was like, you know, keep this up.  You're going to have to leave.  We don't want your kind.  And of course, I turned around and just said, got my service back.  I told him.  Hey, Jay, St. Patty's Day wasn't the same this year without you.  Oh, man, I'm sure.  We went to.  I'm sure there's a lot left over.  Well, it wasn't like last year with the kids blowing off the fireworks in the streets and stuff.  No, Saudi and Boston, very Irish down there. 
[58:30]
 And yeah, they celebrate St. Patty's Day different.  I think they're training the children for the IRA.  I swear to God, we were walking down the streets of Saudi and Boston, St. Patty's Day.  These kids, I don't know where they got these things.  They were called bomb packs.  I kid you not.  It's a package that you pull this little string out of and then throw it.  And 10 seconds later, it blows up.  It makes like a little, you know, little kiddy explosion, but it in fact blows up.  And I hear some of the fathers going, no, sir, this is how you do it. 
[59:00]
 First, you got to put the hood in the car and put it in the car.  That'll get the British bastard.  It's the Queen.  I was like, dude, you're in Massachusetts.  We have some fun when alcohol is involved, don't we?  That was some fun.  Yeah.  All right.  All right, man.  We'll be up there soon.  See you again.  Think of some other sport maybe we could do. 
[59:30]
 Well, we're trying to hire Drunken Jay for our show.  Maybe crowded street javelin throw.  I like that.  Anything else to add, Jay?  No.  You don't want to fuse us back or anything?  All done.  No.  I'm too drunk to do it.  Still, of course, because it's our friend Drunk Jay.  It's a nice little line.  Poor guy.  Come on.  What a name.  Guys, a well-respected man in the community.  What community?  Well, the drunk community.  But it is a community.  Damn, the town drunk. 
[60:00]
 Let's pull that old one out.  Now, Otis, back in the sale.  Oh, no.  I'm out of here.  He's done.  Now he's mad.  All right.  We'll see you soon, man.  Bye, man.  Later.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  See you, man.  Later.  Bye.  Sir, pal.  Jay, our only pal.  We've got to go two states away just to hang out and drink with somebody.  The Rock of New York, 1027 WNEW, Two for Tuesday, ACDC, Money Talks, and you shook me all night  long. 
[60:30]
 It's Opi, it's Anthony.  Hey.  And it's Australian Mark in the studio.  Good day.  Hands again.  Good day, eh?  Good day.  Good day.  Good day.  Good day.  Good day.  Good day.  Good day.  On the way, a chance to win a Day Matthews tickets.  Mark just cursed.  He couldn't tell?  If he was on Australian.  It's a nice curse.  It doesn't count.  Yeah.  If he was on Australian radio, he wouldn't have gotten away with what he just said.  Exactly.  Would you?  And now I...  Are the rules strict down there? 
[61:00]
 No, they're not.  No, it's a little more relaxed here.  Yeah.  Well, who cares if a kangaroo is you?  Well, we invited Mark onto the show today.  Everyone always picks just kangaroos.  Hey, how are the kangaroos?  Roads to school every day.  Every day.  Koalas, man.  Oh yeah, the koalas too.  Come on.  And that crazy guy that's on the Discovery Channel.  Here we go.  I'm going into the hole now.  I'm going to pull him out by his balls. 
[61:30]
 That's that crazy guy's name.  I'm going to stick my arm here in the crocodile's mouth.  The crocodile hunter.  Yeah.  I don't recommend you do this at home.  It's like, yeah, I'm going to go down the street and go catch the croc and roll him.  Well, we got Mark in the studio because...  Anything's better than throwing another shrimp on the body.  That's all I'm saying.  How many times do you have to hear that?  And have you ever had a Vegemite sandwich?  Love the stuff.  You've got to be winged on it, though.  What is Vegemite?  It's like a yeast, black soy sauce paste extract. 
[62:00]
 Oh, stop.  My mouth is watering.  Very salty, but you know, you're raised on it, so...  Yeah.  It's an unacquired taste.  Kind of like the next day after you eat White Castle.  Yeah, that's acquired.  Now, you finished Half-Life.  Yeah, I did indeed.  We were talking about this before.  Yeah, we brought Mark in because, like myself, he's going through withdrawals because this  weekend I finished Tomb Raider III.  Yes.  I started Christmas Day, so it was three months. 
[62:30]
 Three months.  Which is about your time, right?  That's what I say.  Yeah, it took me three months to finish Half-Life, yes.  And I had no life for that period of time.  So, Half-Life is you spend half your life playing and the other half trying to catch  up on sleep.  Life has returned.  I feel empty.  It took me three months or just under to finish Tomb Raider III.  And this weekend I got a lot of stuff done.  I'm like, wow, free time. 
[63:00]
 Yeah, time on your hands now, huh?  It is so bizarre.  For the first time, I worked on our radio show in three months.  I realized that when I was watching Ali McBill last night.  I was like, damn, why am I doing this?  It is so bizarre.  It's like an addiction.  It starts out these video games or whatever.  It just starts out as a stress relief, a little bit of fun.  Recreation.  Recreation, a little entertainment instead of watching the boob tube and stuff.  By the end of the game, it's an addiction.  You have to finish.  It took the first couple of weeks and it becomes an obsession. 
[63:30]
 Yeah.  You cross that line where you start dreaming about it.  It's bad.  Oh, it's bad.  How are you going to get through that next little chorus?  Right.  I turned you on to this.  So I felt like I was the drug dealer.  Bring it on.  Come on, man.  Give me a hint.  I need a clue, man.  Come on.  Yeah, yeah, give me.  I've got to get through this part, man.  The monster's around the corner and I have no ammo.  Does the grenade go under the cab or under the tank or over the tank?  Yeah, how do I blow it up? 
[64:00]
 Now, come on, that's up to you.  I fronted you enough information.  But I felt that way when I first went into electronic sputique to pick up a game.  I walk in and I'm looking through the games and the guy comes over and goes,  Hey, man, you looking for a game?  Yeah, yeah.  Check this out.  Hands me the Half-Life box and goes,  This is some good.  Like, yeah?  It goes, It's the best in the place.  I'm like, All right, thanks.  I almost put it under my jacket and snuck out.  No, I paid for it. 
[64:30]
 Then I got home and my relationship paid for it.  I was on there for 12 hours straight.  A lot of times.  When you finish, you do.  You feel like, Oh, great.  Now what?  You know, it's a big letdown.  It's like a drug because you lose all your relationships.  Yes, relationship definitely suffers.  Your work suffers.  No sleep.  No sleep.  Just like crack cocaine.  You are a crack head with these games.  I understand.  I'm with you.  But now I got all this free time. 
[65:00]
 I don't know what to do.  I'm going to have to get another one.  I'm going to have to get another fix.  I need a bigger and better one.  That's the problem with Half Life because I can't find one that's really as good.  I met my wife last night.  You're back with her, right?  She's looking good after this much time.  I don't know.  I'm thinking siphon filter.  That looks good for PlayStation because I got the PlayStation.  We need Team Fortress 2 to come out.  Half Life Team Fortress 2.  Coming out now, man.  I'm hurting real bad.  Yo, Sierra, I'm hurting real bad. 
[65:30]
 I need this.  You don't understand, man.  I got a camera and a telescope.  I'll sell it to you.  I just need it.  You know, I must say, too, when I completed Tomb Raider 3, it was a big letdown.  I was expecting some huge bells and whistles.  I was expecting you finish the game and all of a sudden on the screen it just goes...  And there's like a number or something you have to call because you finished the game,  right?  And then what?  You can only get this number if you get to the end of the game.  And you dial up the number and this hot blonde comes over and gives you oral favors for free 
[66:00]
 and you finish the game.  Oh, come on.  Well, I was expecting more than a stupid helicopter comes down and takes her away and that's the  end of the game.  Oh, is that what happened?  I thought it was going to open up the treasure, man.  We got like the smoking man from...  Yeah, yeah.  Throughout the whole game you'll be playing, you're battling these huge beasts and then  you look up, you're dying, you're being shot, you're being blown up, you're trying to kill  somebody.  You glance up at a balcony and there's a guy in a suit walking by looking at you.  And you take a few potshots at him, doesn't hurt him. 
[66:30]
 So finally at the end you get to meet this guy and he tells you what the whole thing  was, fills you in and then tells you you want to keep working for him or you got a decision  to make.  You make the wrong decision, you end up back with a bunch of monsters.  You make the right one, you go on to the sequel, I guess.  I don't know.  Wow.  See, I was expecting like Lara Croft to come over and give me a personal lap dance for  finishing this game.  I wouldn't want to do a lap dance from her.  She'll shoot you.  That's true.  But it was a let down.  I was expecting something serious.  Well, you need your next fix. 
[67:00]
 You need your next fix.  You have a real empty feeling now.  It won't be the end of an addiction.  It's never a happy moment.  You need more.  It just means you need more.  You can't be satisfied.  You're addicted.  Hi, NDW.  We need a video game rehab.  Hey, what's going on?  I don't have a problem.  What are you talking about?  I just need more games.  What's up, buddy?  What's going on?  I got a suggestion.  Oh, dude, I got a great Half-Life story, actually.  I finally beat the game about a month ago.  All right.  And after I beat the game, I got a great half-life story.  I got a great half-life story, actually.  I finally beat the game about a month ago.  I couldn't hear what that do with the glasses and the briefcase was saying. 
[67:30]
 I just spent months playing this thing and I couldn't figure out what the end was.  Oh, my God.  It was the secret to life.  Oh, you missed it.  Oh, well, try again.  So, I finally beat it the other day and it was kind of like a letdown.  Yeah, I know.  It was kind of like he was like, would you like to, Gordon, would you like to join us  or would you like to fight the monsters again? 
[68:00]
 So, I joined them and the screen went black.  Yeah, well, it's for the sequel, I guess.  I don't know.  All right.  What are you guys going through with Drow, huh?  Oh, yeah.  I got a good...  Real bad.  I got a quick game that could possibly help you.  It's StarCraft.  StarCraft, I know.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, I'm not into StarCraft.  Drunk J, our friend plays that.  Yeah, I'm not into that one.  Not into the strategy games?  Well, I don't know.  I'm looking at Siphon Filter for PlayStation, I think.  I like first-person perspective.  Quake 2.  It's like the new ghetto.  Yeah, I know. 
[68:30]
 It's like we need the methadone of video games right now.  Like Quake.  Quake 2 is a methadone for me.  It's not quite filling me in, giving me the buzz that Half-Life did, but I need something.  And then I have my Half-Life team fortress coming out.  Right.  I'm a PC player that I'm on every night.  So, you know, I'm getting along.  I'm not feeling totally fulfilled, but you know, it's working for now.  One day at a time. 
[69:00]
 Oh, man.  It's hard.  It really is.  I don't know what to do with myself tonight.  But yeah.  I almost threw the PlayStation through the window.  You get those moments.  Well, like I said, it starts out as a fun game, and by the end you want to kill somebody.  Literally.  I'm the computer game sort of guy before this.  It just kills you.  But I was doing Tomb Raider 3, and I was going further and further into the game one day.  And I was getting really far.  I'm like, should I save the game here?  I don't have enough save crystals.  Should I save?  It was a big decision.  I'm like, no, I'll go a little further. 
[69:30]
 Why a little further?  Should I save here?  No, no, no.  I'll go a little further.  Keep going, right?  Now I'm finally ready to save the game.  The lights flicker in my house.  Oh, no.  And it goes off.  And I'm like, this has got to be Canada Camera.  Where's the damn camera?  I looked at the TV in shock as it pops back on where I was before I started the day's work.  And now Merv is on.  I almost threw the PlayStation through the living room window.  I'm like, you've got to be kidding.  You've got to be kidding me.  You'll get it over at that point. 
[70:00]
 That's part of the anger and anxiety of an addiction opi when it doesn't go your way.  Now did you cheat a little?  Yeah, of course I cheated.  Because I always got to cheat a little.  Because I was talking to people about Tomb Raider 3 and stuff.  You know, I had my fun.  I figured out a lot of the game on my own.  But it got to the point, did I have to play the game perfect so I could brag that I figured  every single part of it by myself?  Of course I cheated a little.  But I had fun, sure. 
[70:30]
 I jumped online and got some walkthroughs and stuff.  Of course.  There you go.  All right.  We've got to hook up a multiplayer.  We'll do some battle.  That's my little method.  Team Fortress.  Yeah.  We'll get through, Max.  We'll get through.  What is...  Hi, Andy W.  Hi, I'm still on bold.  All right, what's up?  Not anymore.  Who is this?  Opi and Anthony.  Hello, how are you?  Good, how are you?  I can't believe I'm actually getting to speak to you.  Cool.  I've been calling for days and every time I call, people slam the phone down.  Oh, no, really?  And you're rude to me and they say they're busy, they have no time. 
[71:00]
 Well, what you have to say must be very important.  Well, no, it was just my feelings were hurt and I couldn't understand.  Why were your feelings hurt?  Because nobody would talk to me.  And every time I hear you guys on the radio, you're so nice to everybody.  Everybody's so nice.  Okay, now we're listening.  I've been calling all... for like four days now to try to win tickets and I thought I  wanted to do it and I said, all right, I gave up on that.  I just want to speak to them, tell them I love their show.  I have a great time listening to them. 
[71:30]
 I even sent you an email and I couldn't get through and the guy says, now they're busy.  It slams the phone down on me and they say, geez.  That's kind of credit to have that they do that.  You know, yeah, my feelings got hurt because I've been listening to N.E.W. for like 25  years and then when it started, I was getting kind of... you know, I stopped.  Boy, anyone else see that coming?  I was waiting, my God.  Telegraph that one, huh?  All right, well...  To that lady, if she's still listening, there's a problem with our phones. 
[72:00]
 Thank you for that little AA meeting.  I feel better.  You feel better now?  Good.  All right.  We have to play this.  You want to play it now instead of taking a break?  Yeah, go ahead.  Hopefully there's people still listening.  We're a talk station, all right?  Pretty much, according to the paper.  Just rumors.  People are quitting left and right around here today.  What's going on?  They're abandoning ship.  Our buddy Ken Dashaw just quit, I heard.  Did he? 
[72:30]
 Oops.  Ixnay.  Sorry.  No one knows what we're saying.  No one's listening.  Okay, listen.  So Chelsea and Hillary are in Africa.  Yes.  They're away from the old man for two weeks.  As far away from Bill as possible.  And it's so obvious things are going on.  He's in a crisis right now with Kosovo.  And she should be there.  Yeah, of course.  Supporting him in a decision that might cost men their lives.  And she's out parading to Africa. 
[73:00]
 It's obvious that there's nothing there.  Nothing.  Spending a couple weeks in Africa, we got exclusive audio, Anthony, of Hillary and Chelsea's trip to Africa.  All right.  Would you like to hear the first clip here?  I would love to.  Okay, let's take a listen.  Mom, are these people cannibals?  Now, now, Chelsea.  Why would you say that?  Because the chief said he'd give anything to eat me.  He sounds a lot like your father. 
[73:30]
 Your mother Hillary is very respected here.  She has the one quality that is most coveted in our village.  What's that?  Wisdom, compassion?  No, a fat white ass.  Oh, wow.  Your African name, Chelsea, is Kiala Abalafu.  That's beautiful.  What does it mean?  Lanky pale girl with face of a wombat.  Oh.  Hey, Mom, Medigo wants me to go into the forest with him.  I think he's going to let me have one of his pets. 
[74:00]
 Why do you think that, Chelsea?  Because he said he's going to give me his 12 inch, you bengie black snake.  Oh, it's beautiful out here, Mandingo.  By the way, what does your name mean?  It means man with three legs.  But you only have two legs.  Oh, really?  Wow.  Chelsea, when we are through tonight, the whole village will call you Iwachela Kanaya.  Neat. What does it mean? 
[74:30]
 That means she who cannot sit for weeks.  Now, grab your ankles, Chelsea, and I will demonstrate what your father does to your countrymen.  Wow. You've got to be kidding me.  Who knew that was going on?  They show those nice clips on the news of them smiling.  Well, I got part two of the bit. Would you like to hear it?  Yeah, we might as well be kicked out of the whole state. 
[75:00]
 Okay.  All right, so continuing with the saga, Hillary and Chelsea in Africa.  Okay.  Here we go. Let's listen to another episode.  Part two?  Part two, yeah.  Oh, Mandingo, it's so big. I need two hands to hold it.  That's it, Chelsea. Now wrap your lips around it.  Like this?  Yes, that's it. Now blow, Chelsea.  Nothing's coming out.  Oh, be patient, Chelsea, and blow harder. 
[75:30]
 Bullseye.  Thanks for showing me how to use your blow gun, Mandingo.  Anytime, Chelsea. We best go back to the village and find your mother.  I wonder where she is.  Maybe she's in this hut.  Oh, I'm so excited.  I wonder where she is.  Maybe she's in this hut.  Mom, what are you doing with Mandingo's sister?  Oh, dear.  You said you were going on a safari. 
[76:00]
 No, no, I said before the day ends, I want to be deep in the bush.  Well, you do what you want. I'm going to help Mandingo take care of a bad animal.  What are you talking about, Chelsea?  He wants me to spank his monkeys.  Well, just be back in time for dinner.  Okay, well, what are we having?  I don't know about you, but I'll be having the African beaver.  Now, come on, that isn't real audio from their trip to Africa, is it? 
[76:30]
 I don't know.  Wow, our source is pretty reliable, Anthony.  That is just out of control.  Wow, the Hillary and Chelsea audio, big hit.  People seem to have liked that one.  Big, huge hit.

 Yes.  Not just like, hey, we'll save you a buck.  Right.  I can't get at it.  Yeah, why bother at that point?  Yeah.  One oh two seven W.W. the rock of New York.  Officially a three for from the doors, Anthony.  Ho ho.  Officially.  You caught us.  Blue Sunday, peace frog and back door man.  Dude.  What?  Dow down 218.  Close down.  Now, this amazes me about Wall Street, if I may quickly.  See, it says mounting concerns that corporate earnings growth may have slowed substantially 
[78:30]
 caused fear and selling on Wall Street.  So, all right, that now it goes down.  But then in two weeks, it's like the bright economic future caused a rally on Wall Street.  And then like two weeks later, you get, oh, it's it's looking grim again, folks.  We're all fickle.  Does it happen every two weeks?  Like, can't you get a big picture on the economy?  Look at it and go, it's good.  It will be good for a few months to come.  But there's a lot of people out there that day trade and they ride the highs and the 
[79:00]
 lows, and that's how they make their money.  Yeah, but the market takes the big dumps and big gains on on rumor, at least or news  of the economy being good or bad or heading toward good or bad.  So how could it change every other day?  These people are like, oh, mounting concerns, low earnings, oh, boy, it's looking grim,  inflation, oh, boy, interest rate.  And then two days later, it's the same things, but they're good.  Everything's right.  And that's why everything went up.  Now, how did Infinity Broadcasting do? 
[79:30]
 Because there's a lot of rumors about any W.  Did that affect the price?  The stock price today, Anthony?  Last I checked, it was down.  It was down.  OK.  Yes.  Yes.  Make me.  Oh, but you think that's because of us?  I think it plummeted after the Hillary Chelsea Africa bet.  That's a great bet.  I want to hear that again.  Don't worry.  No.  In our show, we'll play another four times this way.  Yeah.  Like MTV over here. 
[80:00]
 All right.  Listen, we've got to get a Dave Matthews ticket winner.  Yes.  Dave Matthews playing a special show for us tomorrow with Ralph  Titora at a secret location.  I know the place, too.  That would really piss off a lot of people, though.  No.  Uh-oh.  Uh-oh.  Why is the boss in here?  Hi, boss.  Oh, my God.  Bye, people.  Bye.  He doesn't have a baseball bat, so I think we're OK.  He was on earlier.  Mr. Herman, how are you?  Hi, guys. 
[80:30]
 We like to call him the big boss man.  Go ahead.  Did you hear that?  When he walks in, I get scared and stuff like he's going to get scared.  You know?  Boop!  The Opium Anthony program will no longer be heard in this time slot.  I am armed with cassettes and phone messages.  What can I, uh...  Oh, really?  Cassettes of what?  Our show?  That people mail you and...  As a matter of fact, yes.  Point out little things that we've done and...  You've got to talk into the mic.  There we go.  Hi.  What's the latest complaint?  We just got through a nasty complaint and we're safe, right? 
[81:00]
 I hope so.  We won't say which one.  Yes.  We made it through that one?  Unscathed?  Mm-hmm.  OK.  What's the latest one?  The latest one is we have to make sure that we're doing the stacker commercials.  Yeah.  Right.  OK?  That we mention their slogan.  Yeah.  Which is the world's strongest fat burner.  Right.  We meet the client very nicely.  Oh, yeah.  We love stacker.  We have been.  Opie's been taking stacker, too. 
[81:30]
 Look at him.  And it has helped me.  He's a lean, mean, fighting machine.  That's the first that comes to mind when I think of him.  They don't like the drug references that we've made in the past.  Correct.  OK.  Correct.  Oh, they were done in jest.  No, no, no.  I know that.  I know that.  But, you know...  It's called kidding.  I know, but you know what?  These people are buying time.  OK.  All right.  The comedy portion is when people are not paying for it.  OK?  I see.  We have the comedy portion.  No. 
[82:00]
 You pay for the comedy portion.  Exactly.  OK.  So, what's the tape?  Yeah.  Is the tape...  That looks like a tape of our show.  Saying something bad?  No.  As a matter of fact, it's fine.  Oh, OK.  But, you know...  Did you hear our last bit?  There are times that I can't be at the radio, you know?  And I have things taped and I listen to it when I go home so I can just...  Was the tape rolling on the Chelsea-Hillary in Africa bit we just played?  No.  Oh, good.  You may be getting some calls in that tomorrow.  Is that good?  Well, no.  It's that good.  It's that double entendre humor that you told us to work on. 
[82:30]
 It's a cute little bit.  This guy, Mandingo, teaches her how to use a blowgun.  Maybe we want to move to triple entendre.  Triple entendre with our first...  Quadruple entendre.  That way no one understands.  Right.  All right.  So, you didn't hear that bit.  That's good.  All right.  Good.  You'll have a happy drive home then.  For once.  Any other?  Any other news there?  No.  Reporters calling about the story in the Daily News?  Yeah, they are.  And you know what? 
[83:00]
 It's...  Rumors are rumors.  I mean, we talked about this earlier.  Who starts rumors?  Other stations.  Exactly.  Other stations, boss.  Other stations, right?  I mean, all radio stations are always looking for, you know, things they should be doing  to get more listeners, to get more listening.  True.  You know?  Oh, okay.  I mean, but, you know, Jesus.  I get nervous when I think...  The only thing you really know about the newspaper is like your business.  Right.  And when you know how poorly things are written about your business, doesn't it get you to 
[83:30]
 worry about...  Fine up.  Like when you're reading about the war in Yugoslavia, whether they could possibly be  right about that.  I know.  It's halfway around the world.  And we don't know from a hole in the wall what the actual facts are.  Yeah, when they write stuff about you, you're like, wait a minute.  That's not true.  That's not true.  But no one's going to believe me.  Yeah.  So.  But we're allowed to talk more, right?  Talk more.  Absolutely.  Yeah, talk more.  And play in that great rock.  See?  We played six songs today.  The whole day?  Yeah.  So far.  See, that's where rumors come from.  That's how that crap gets to the paper. 
[84:00]
 Well, who wants to hear a Stix 2 for...  Jesus, we've got a Chelsea and Hillary bit to get to.  Oh, you see, there you go again.  Now the music department's going to get all upset.  I'll get them.  I'll get them, boss.  OPI, that's not productive.  It does you or the station no good to downplay the music.  Right.  What you do is good, but the music also helps to...  Could you shut me up?  Could you throw something at my head?  Very good, Anthony.  That would fall into the idle bitching department.  No, I think that's the fake remorse.  Can we play a couple songs that we dig tomorrow? 
[84:30]
 I mean, really dig?  I want to play like, Godsmack.  Godsmack's good.  I want to play Rob Zombie.  There's no one.  Living Dead Girl.  God, that song rocks.  Would that make you happy?  Yeah.  Tomorrow, can we play a couple of our faves just as a goof?  Sure.  Is Gary still gone?  Gary will be back tomorrow.  Damn.  I want to play Whatever by Godsmack.  Is the language okay or am I approving something that I'm going to play?  We'll get the radio edit.  No, the Godsmack Whatever is one of the hottest songs in the country right now. 
[85:00]
 Okay.  You'll get the radio edit, though.  We can find that.  And then Anthony wants to play a couple.  Living Dead Girl, yeah.  Living Dead Girl would be cool.  I mean, I don't like the doors and stuff.  Okay, now we've just gone from can I play War?  to I want to play a few and Anthony wants to play a couple.  Come on.  Next thing you know, we have anarchy and another article in the paper. </pre>
