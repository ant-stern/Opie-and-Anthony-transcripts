<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show opened with the hosts addressing their recent absence and the fallout from Friday's broadcast, specifically the removal of several photos from their website by their provider, WebJump.  These photos included a picture of a black girl being whipped by a dominatrix, a "Mentos video," and images of a woman named Tara.  The hosts engaged in a humorous rant about finding a new web host who would tolerate their content, even mentioning a clip of a horse having sex with a girl.  Their boss then unexpectedly arrived in the studio, leading to a Godfather-esque conversation about rumored format changes to a talk radio station and a suspected Daily News leak.  Playful threats and speculation about the leaker's identity ensued, with the hosts noting their boss's perceived lack of enthusiasm.  They proceeded to call several web hosting companies in search of a new provider.

A substantial portion of the show revolved around the removed photos, particularly those featuring Spike, a dominatrix, disciplining Earl, a staff member.  The hosts discussed Spike's appearance and profession, even suggesting a "dominatrix beauty pageant." A caller criticized the photos' quality, sparking a discussion of the hosts' preferences for women, referencing a "dirty girl" aesthetic and comparing a blonde woman's hairstyle to Sally from *Davey and Goliath*.  The Oscars were then critiqued, with the hosts mocking the performances of Roberto Benigni and Whoopi Goldberg, the latter's behavior described as sexually suggestive.  They segued into a humorous segment about an annoying MTV VJ, Jesse, suggesting replacing him with a rock, and then promoted the energy supplement "Stack or Two."  A rumor about Monica Lewinsky attending Oscar parties was also discussed.  The show concluded with further website woes and a trivia contest involving Viagra for Dave Matthews Band tickets.

The second portion began with a contest winner, Laura, expressing her excitement about winning (possibly Dave Matthews Band tickets). The hosts then debated their musical preferences, weighing Pearl Jam against AC/DC. A lengthy call with "Drunken Jay" followed, detailing various alcohol-fueled escapades including hatchet throwing at a Renaissance festival, candlepin bowling, and incidents at a bar called Green Acres known for bar fights.  These stories involved heavy drinking and reckless behavior.  The hosts then played an exclusive audio skit featuring graphic sexual humor about Hillary and Chelsea Clinton's supposed activities in Africa.

Australian Mark, a studio guest, joined the show, discussing video game withdrawal after finishing Half-Life and Tomb Raider 3, respectively.  Their conversation was filled with humorous hyperbole about their gaming addiction. Several callers interacted with the hosts; one complained about the rudeness of past phone operators.  Mr. Herman, their boss, made a second appearance, addressing concerns about the show's content, the use of Stacker commercials and their slogan, recent negative press, and rumors surrounding the show.  The broadcast ended with further discussion of musical preferences and the upcoming playlist.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  The Rock of New York, 1027 WNEW, two for Tuesday with you two, even better than the real thing, and with or without you.  It's Opie and Anthony, and no, we did not get fired.  No, we're back, we're back.  We're back.  Reading these emails, some people concerned, Opie, that for our hijinks on Friday, that we may have been terminated here at the NEW, but no.  No.  We are indeed here, we just took the day yesterday.  Yeah, that's what we're telling people.  Well, thanks to Tony Pegg for sitting in on our show on Monday. 
[00:00:30]  And thanks for management understanding our concerns.  Okay.  Well, at least if you missed Friday's show, you could pop up the pictures on the website and, oh, that's right, they're not there anymore.  Hmm, that's interesting.  I wonder if the two events are related.  Hmm, let's see.  People are making, they're starting their own conspiracy theories.  The website was gone and we were gone from the radio.  Yesterday.  Hmm, that's interesting.  Yeah. 
[00:01:00]  Let's, let's pop up, because a little, a little page comes up when you, you go to our website to see the pictures of maybe a black girl being whipped by the dominatrix.  Right.  Or, you want to see the Mentos video, which was just so popular, people love that.  Mm-hmm.  Or the pictures of Tara, again, if you would miss them.  Yeah.  Um, the blonde chick.  Well, let's, let's look.  Hmm.  Oh, the website you're seeking cannot be found.  Possible reasons.  Well, let's run through these and see if maybe one fits. 
[00:01:30]  Okay.  Uh, you may have mistyped the URL.  Mm-hmm.  They are complicated.  Sometimes, uh, you can mistype them, but I was using, uh, a favorite link.  Mm-hmm.  So, it wasn't that I typed the name in.  And you just click on the icon, so I don't think people, uh.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Uh, the site could be under construction.  Please try back later.  No.  No, I don't think that fits.  Considering if you saw the website before we got kicked off, there was not much construction ever going on.  Right.  See, the account may have been, uh, moved or no longer exists.  No, it's, it's still there. 
[00:02:00]  Trust me.  Mm-hmm.  I know, uh, I know where I put the stuff.  Hmm.  The site may have been removed due to violating our accepted uses and policy standards.  Well.  Well.  Now, that might be it.  Let's, let's click on that link and see what their, uh, policy is.  Okay.  All right.  Unlawful activities such as unauthorized distribution or copying of copyrighted photos.  No.  No.  We took those.  Um.  Um, copyrighted software.  No.  Export restrictions.  No.  Fraud. 
[00:02:30]  No.  Solicitation of gambling or prostitution.  Mm, not really.  Not that I know of.  Okay.  Uh, practices which may be considered obscene and or illegal material.  Whoops.  Hey!  Hey!  There it is!  Winner!  Winner!  Winner!  I know it was in there.  Well, WebJump.  The, the people at WebJump have deemed our material obscene, Opie.  The fine people of WebJump.  Something the Supreme Court of our United States of America cannot even define. 
[00:03:00]  Obscenity.  But they have seen it as obscene.  They have decided our stuff is obscene, Anthony.  So, so now we, so now we're looking for another, uh, provider at this point in time.  Why cannot I find a land for my material to rest in peace?  My God!  We travel journey together on this internet, just looking for a homeland that will accept us!  Let my pornography stay! 
[00:03:30]  Damn you, WebJump!  So here we are.  Our journey continues for a homeland.  Why, damn you?  Why can't I put my smut on a website?  I hate you!  I have a clip of that horse having sex with a girl, too.  They won't let that on there, either.  Damn them all to hell!  We will, we will journey through the desert, trying to find a website that will accept us for what we are! 
[00:04:00]  Herbert!  Damn you!  Well, there we go.  That's six or seven sites we've been kicked off of.  I believe that would be six.  And our own, on any W site, won't even let us on there.  No, they won't even acknowledge us at this point, our material.  All right.  Well, the search continues for a, uh, for a, a server. 
[00:04:30]  I'm trying here, people.  Yeah.  So it may be a few days.  We'll find someone new.  We'll get something.  Don't, don't worry.  They'll be back.  All right.  Well, that's a nice little start to the program there.  Well, there you go.  We're off.  We got the boss in the studio, but if we put him on mic, we're going to have to ask him some hard questions.  So we'll let him sit there.  Oh, yes.  Unless he wants to take a mic.  You were quoted in the Daily News today, boss.  Did you see that?  I like his answer.  It wasn't a quote.  His answer is, uh, oh, it wasn't a quote.  It was him saying that, uh... 
[00:05:00]  We don't comment on rumors.  We don't comment on rumors.  Short.  Concise.  I like it.  To the point.  Did you have him whacked after he asked you such a, an insulting, disrespectful question?  We actually never talked.  You didn't?  No.  So how did he get that?  Well, he left me a message that he wanted to talk to me.  Yeah.  And I left him a voicemail message back saying there's no reason to talk to me, but if you want a quote to put in your column, my quote would be.  Oh.  Oh, I see.  Hey, this is all about this whole thing about N.E.W. just flipping formats for some reason. 
[00:05:30]  Now it's a rumor that it's going to be a talk station.  I don't know.  I haven't heard anything, but I am disturbed by something I read in that Daily News thing, boss.  What's that?  Did you read it?  Yes.  N.E.W. staffer, and all of a sudden they're spilling what was said in our private meetings.  Did you read that?  I want him dead.  We got right.  I want him whacked.  How do you do this?  How do you handle this?  Luca Brasi?  You know what?  Who are you going to get?  We've got to whack this guy.  You round up the usual suspects if you question them. 
[00:06:00]  Who is it?  I think this person should be made an example.  You know, like, all right, grab the cannolis.  And you know what?  Not that the things we talk about are like ultra top secret, but what good could possibly come from talking to the newspapers about things that go on in our staff meeting?  Exactly.  Now, where do you think the rumors start?  The rumors start from other radio stations.  Yes.  That are just trying to cause tumult.  Right, Godfather.  So who needs that?  You are right. 
[00:06:30]  You are right, Godfather.  Don Herman.  We are behind you all the way.  And we will find this traitor who in the paper is letting out family secrets.  I don't like this.  So how are you going to find them?  I think it's the person that is going to arrange security for our next meeting.  Tessio.  That bastard.  He was always the smart one.  It's strictly business.  I understand this.  But we can't let these people off the hook.  I want him whacked.  See, usually it's the person that comes to ask you about the format change that was the one that leaked it. 
[00:07:00]  Oh.  Who came to you?  Oh, everyone.  All right.  All right.  We will have to track this person down, though.  And Don Herman, we will bring him to you.  And you will administer your justice as you do with your baseball bat up in your office.  I want his head cracked open.  We cannot have a family business build about the papers in this fashion.  Thank you.  So are we going all talk?  Is that the whole thing?  Don't go to him with the question. 
[00:07:30]  Oh, my God.  It's going to be like Fredo.  Is that the rumor?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Do we have your permission to turn our show into a talk show?  That would be fun.  Well, what do you think we're doing?  This is pretty much...  Whether they like it or not, Opie, we've already made that decision.  You've been on the air 23 minutes.  How much music have you played?  The Godfather theme.  Well, today we've played four records already.  Sounds like it doesn't matter what I think.  It sounds like you've already made it a talk station.  Maybe that's where the rumors start.  Yeah, really.  They're listening to the Opie and Anthony show going, I never hear music. 
[00:08:00]  I think the rumors started with Steve Mason and you guys.  You think so?  Oh, we're conjuring this up.  No.  Interesting.  Interesting.  Oh, we got website providers on the line, Anthony.  Oh, good.  Get them.  Tell them, I don't want to sign anything.  I don't want this wacky, if you use 100 gigs, then you pay.  I want a password, I want a username, and I want megs of storage space. 
[00:08:30]  Unlimited bandwidth.  It sounds like a lot, but trust me, I will pop a banner on your stupid site.  We'll take care of you.  I need space.  I need speed.  I need unlimited bandwidth.  All right.  I need prostitutes.  You want to take a break, I guess?  Oh, yeah.  Are you going to play music or something?  Well, it is two for Tuesday.  Oh, that's right.  We've talked twice as long as we usually do.  Why do you say it like that?  See, that's what puts the rumor.  Oh.  That's what prolongs the rumor.  He didn't sound enthusiastic.  He didn't sound enthusiastic. 
[00:09:00]  Well, I'm enthusiastic because there's only a few of these left.  Oh.  Oh.  Check, please.  Wow.  We can at least see the end, the light at the end of the tunnel, so.  Sound enthusiastic.  The Rock of New York, 1027 WNEW, two for Tuesday.  Creed.  That's one.  My own prison before that from their debut CD.  Hey, Sophie.  It's Anthony.  Hey.  Wow. 
[00:09:30]  And no, we did not get fired.  We just took a day off yesterday.  Yes, we are back.  We are back.  We've got to talk to Earl.  Maybe not this break.  Maybe later on in the show, because we haven't seen him since he got punished with all those  nasty pictures.  When did the website actually throw the pictures off?  Was it over the weekend or today?  If you're just tuning in, we have a lot of pretty rude pictures under the semi-live studio  cam of our section of the WNEW website. 
[00:10:00]  Yeah.  And we just got thrown off our sixth server because of the content of our pictures.  Yeah.  Yeah.  That being pictures of Earl getting disciplined by Spike.  Yeah.  His hands were tied.  He was gagged.  There were things in his face that shouldn't be in his face.  Yeah.  She had something, an apparatus strapped on, let's just say.  Mm-hmm.  And yeah, she had high heels on.  She was gouging them into his groin area.  Pretty sick.  Some of the best pictures I've ever seen. 
[00:10:30]  Yeah.  Really good.  And I don't know.  I checked yesterday afternoon and they were gone.  They were gone yesterday afternoon?  Oh, yeah.  They may have been gone by like Sunday or Saturday.  God damn.  Man.  So we're looking for a server now.  We've gotten some leads.  So hopefully I'll have these pictures back up by later today or tonight.  Well, we need a site by Friday because I think a couple girls are taking on Tara as the hottest girl to ever be naked on the Opie and Anthony show.  Friday?  We need, yes, we need some web space by Friday. 
[00:11:00]  Yeah.  Hi, N.E.W.  Hello.  Hi, what's going on?  Hey, what's up?  I heard you guys need a new web app provider.  Yeah, but this is boring for the radio, so hold on.  Yeah.  All right.  Just get his name and number, man.  Hi, N.E.W.  Yeah, yellow.  Hi, N.E.W.  Yeah, they were still there at 530 last night.  Oh, they were?  Yes, they were.  That's about when I checked, so.  They were still there.  They were there Saturday night.  Okay.  They were there Friday night.  All right.  Because I checked Friday, I heard it from upstate New York, the broadcast, and I checked it Friday night. 
[00:11:30]  Oh, so they threw it off last night sometime.  Probably last night or from last night to this morning.  That's okay.  That means we got three good days out of it.  Yeah, I wasn't expecting much more than that, to tell you the truth.  I think between the...  Very explicit.  I think between the Earl getting disciplined, and then the Mentos video, I think, really put it over the top.  That was a little explicit.  It took a long time to download.  Yeah, it was a big file.  Yeah, we got to get a faster server. 
[00:12:00]  Yeah, fast server.  That should just pop right up.  Is it the host, or is it the receiver when they try to download it?  I think it's the host, if I had to guess.  Yeah, it wasn't really.  I'm not great on that kind of stuff, but it took a while.  I did other things around the house while that thing came out.  Oh, no, see, that should never be the case.  I mean, there are servers out there.  If you clicked on that Mentos file, it should have taken, what, a minute tops?  No, I think it took over 10, 15 minutes.  Nah, really?  For me, yeah.  We need a faster provider than that.  A couple of minutes.  I honestly do think it took that long. 
[00:12:30]  All right.  Because I was doing other things Friday night when it was there.  There you go.  All right, thanks, buddy.  No problem.  All right.  All right.  Hi, N.E.W.  Hi.  I just wanted to say that, you know, those pictures weren't so great to begin with.  Really?  You know, Spike isn't that great looking.  Spike?  Yeah.  No, you've got to understand, she's hot in the dominatrix kind of way.  You know, okay, in that way.  Yeah, we're not looking for a Playboy model.  She was all about, like, discipline and chains and whips and tattoos. 
[00:13:00]  Yeah, yeah, but, you know, you could have got somebody much better looking.  I don't know.  As far as dominatrix go, I think we were right on top of it.  Spike works, man.  Maybe Tara doing the dominatrix thing.  But see, Tara's like the girl next door.  That's what her look's all about.  And Spike is all about, like, scars and scabs.  Spike's the real deal.  And being gnarly and stuff.  You know, her boobs weren't the same size.  They were...  I noticed that.  The one boob was a little bigger than that.  Oh, yeah.  I didn't like that.  Oh, boy, but who cares? 
[00:13:30]  Geez.  I guess Miss Perfect here wants to come in here and pose.  No.  Know what we could do?  What?  We could have a dominatrix beauty pageant.  Oh, that's an idea.  With a little talent portion?  Yeah.  Yeah.  What do you think?  Maybe.  I mean, calling all dominatrix.  I mean, the publicity you would...  Well, maybe their boobs would be the same size.  I would...  I don't know.  I would put my money on Spike on a dominatrix beauty contest.  What was with the blue eye shadow? 
[00:14:00]  That's what I mean.  She's all about, like, looking, like...  The look.  Yeah, she's all, you know, scammed up and stuff.  You're not in the scene, so you don't know what it's about.  Well, you know, I could be.  We're in the scene.  No, I don't...  You know, maybe the sock...  You know, with the sock that Tara was wearing,  maybe that would have helped Spike a little bit.  No, we're in it.  You're in it.  Yeah, we go down to the seedy clubs.  Yeah.  Well, what do you...  Anybody could be in it.  All right, wait.  What do you look for in a dominatrix?  Well, I...  You're not going to get a really, like, hot playboy model 
[00:14:30]  that pulls off the whole dominatrix angle.  No.  They could dress up in the dominatrix gear,  but it's just not the same.  You're working in the Fredericks of Hollywood, you know?  They're not going to be able to do it, though.  Yeah, you...  She cracks the whip.  She works in Fredericks, you know?  She cracks the whip.  She has strap-ons.  So you'll get a girl that's all hot,  dressed up in this lingerie with a whip,  going like,  Dude, you want me to tap you?  No.  You need the real deal.  Spike's real.  Oh.  I mean, there's a chance you're going to get hurt  when you're with Spike.  Oh, right.  It's not about, you know, fake S&M. 
[00:15:00]  She's the real deal.  I'm sure there are people out there  who are into this that are a decent woman.  Let me tell you something.  No.  No, actually, there aren't.  Let me tell you something about Spike.  She gets, like, $200 an hour to do that.  She's got, like...  On Friday night, she was with a pretty serious TV producer  that's in his 60s  that likes to dress up as a girl.  As Spike disciplines him.  She dressed him up in a little girl dress.  She's the real deal.  It's not about a, you know,  let's get a little wild on a Friday night, honey.  I know, I know.  This lady makes her living.  Well, you know... 
[00:15:30]  And I find her attractive.  You do?  I do.  There's something very attractive about her.  What is it?  I don't know what it is.  There's just something about her.  First of all, her body is definitely not bad.  Yeah, I like her bod.  And even if you get past that makeup and stuff...  Is that the boob thing?  I mean, guys...  I've seen a lot worse boobs.  She's a dirty girl.  She's a very dirty girl, and that's attractive.  Well, you know, we can all fit the role sometimes.  You must be really hot, because you're picky.  Oh, come on.  Are you hot?  No. 
[00:16:00]  Then why are you so picky?  I'm not picky.  I'm just saying,  if you're going to put pictures on the internet,  let's have some night, you know?  You can go to, like, Playboy.com and get that crap.  We're showing the real deal.  The real deal.  The stuff that gets kicked off of six consecutive web servers.  Yeah, scabs.  We're proud of it.  Scabs and all.  I mean, shit.  I mean, Spike had hickeys and bruises all over her body, man.  She was all roughed up.  You could punch up...  That's cheesy.  You could punch up pictures of hot girls on the web  at the drop of a hat.  Put in hot girls, and everything will come up. 
[00:16:30]  I don't know.  This offers something that's a little different.  Oh, okay.  It's the stuff that gets banned.  I mean, it's your opinion.  I respect that.  But I could take an hour of calls from guys  that all just would love to be with Spike for an hour.  You know what?  You guys have a little twisted...  I don't know.  You're into the not-so-pretty-looking girls.  Even the girl with the blonde hair that was on the pictures.  Uh-huh.  The little spinner.  You know, she was ugly, too.  Come on.  She wasn't ugly.  She was like a little dirty girl.  What?  The Gwen Stefani look-alike? 
[00:17:00]  Yeah.  She's not ugly.  What was with the hairdo?  She wasn't ugly.  Come on.  I've seen the hotter girls, but, you know, I want to take her out of bed, man.  I don't know.  I think you guys just have different, you know, your tastes are not the norm.  I don't know.  I also, you know, like to look at a real hot model and stuff.  It's all what you're into.  It's all taste.  Okay.  You know?  All right.  Obi, you're kind of cute, too, you know.  All right, guys.  I got to go.  Well, send a picture.  All right. 
[00:17:30]  I'll send a picture.  All right.  Thank you.  Okay.  Bye.  Bye.  Yeah, the blonde girl's hair kind of did have that Sally from, who's that?  Sally Hanson.  Sally, yes.  From Davey and Goliath.  Oh, my God.  Davey's sister.  Davey Hanson's sister, Sally.  Remember her hair?  Yeah.  It looked like the blonde thing, but two, like, yodels.  Yes, yes.  On the side.  It was like this round.  Even as a kid, I'm watching going, hey, damn it, that looked like a couple of yodels.  What do you think, man? 
[00:18:00]  Dominatrix beauty contest.  Yeah, I like it.  You line up the dominatrix, and beauty is just a word when we use it in that fashion.  All sizes and shapes.  I know there's a lot of dominatrix women that listen to us.  They come in with their little get-up, and we'll have the listeners vote who's the hottest  dominatrix.  Who's the hottest dominatrix?  Or someone, you know, will crown the hardcore champion.  As someone said on Friday, hardcore champion of the world!  Yeah, we could do that.  That's Spike's title, officially. 
[00:18:30]  Yeah, she's the hardcore champ.  In WWF terms, Tara is the champ, hottest girl to ever pose naked on the Open Anthem show,  and Spike is the hardcore champion of the world.  We need our intercontinental and European champions.  Then the belts will just change hands every day.  All right.  You want to play some more music?  No.  Well.  Oh, yeah.  We got until they flip, so let's...  Until...  Now you're confirming rumors, Opie.  This is not...  These are rumors.  The bosses are going to great lengths to say these are indeed just rumors. 
[00:19:00]  Started by other stations, people in the business.  N.E.W. has not made any decisions as far as changing any formats.  I don't know what you're saying.  Okay.  You heard the boss say he's not commenting on rumors.  Right.  Well, we asked him, and he didn't give us an answer.  No, he didn't.  I found that a little suspicious.  Look into it, man.  We're not that dumb.  Hey, come on.  So, all right.  We'll play a couple tunes.  What the hell?  For a goof, huh?  For a goof.  We'll play a couple of tunes for a goof. 
[00:19:30]  I understand.  We'll play a tasty cut.  Yeah.  From Pink Floyd.  We'll get...  You know, we'll get a Pink Floyd song out of the way that you've heard a million times,  and then one you've only heard a couple.  Is this the NBA telethon all of a sudden?  It sounded like Close Encounters.  All right.  The Rock of New York, 1027.  WNEW, two for Tuesday.  Pink Floyd for metal. 
[00:20:00]  That's fearless.  And run like hell before that.  It's Opie and Anthony.  Thanks for checking us out today.  Appreciate it.  Yeah.  All right.  Britney's...  What's her name?  Britney Spears?  Yeah.  Britney Spears on MTV right now.  Yeah.  Let me look.  Oh, yeah.  I liked her better when she was called Debbie Gibson.  Same chick, right?  I think so.  Yeah.  I think you're right there.  Pretty much.  Did anyone else see the...  God darn it.  I knew I forgot something today.  What? 
[00:20:30]  We were goofing on Jesse from MTV.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  Did you see the commercial?  They're running every, like, two minutes on MTV.  Yes, I have.  Oh, if he could be a VJ, anyone can?  Yeah.  Damn, we need that audio.  Yeah.  That would be a VJ.  It would be cool.  That I guess...  I could go to a concert.  It would be a stupid VJ.  Because they're running that contest again and looking for another VJ.  Yeah.  This time, I'm convinced they're just going to get a rock.  Just get a big, dopey rock, put it somewhere, and put, like, VJ rock underneath it. 
[00:21:00]  Yeah.  And then they'll just show it and then go to a video.  Yeah.  It would be less annoying than that stupid Jesse.  And then just put the VJ rock on tour, and people would come out to see the VJ rock.  You are so right.  Yeah.  They could make the rock famous.  So that when people see a rock, it'll be like, well, that's not the rock.  That's not the rock.  But then when they bring the VJ rock to your city, you'd, like, stand on line.  Of course you would.  Dude, that's the rock.  Get a picture of me with the rock.  They should do that.  That's... 
[00:21:30]  I'm telling you to Jesse.  Yeah, I'm a VJ.  I'm a VJ.  Gooby-ga-ga-gooby-goo.  We've got to roll tape on MTV because they will run the spot.  They've been playing it every two seconds.  Every two seconds.  But then...  What was the question?  But that's how pathetic our society is as far as fame and stuff goes.  If we put, like, a rock on TV long enough and then you put the rock at a bookstore, people  would line up to get a picture with the rock.  With the rock.  MTV rocks with the rock on spring break and, like, have the rock with a bunch of chicks 
[00:22:00]  in bikinis.  Yeah.  And it's a whole special.  Exactly.  The rock spring break special.  And there's just no sound.  It's just the rock.  It's just the rock to check out.  And chicks.  And chicks.  You'd watch.  Of course you would.  More than I would Jesse because then I'd turn it off.  Even with the chicks.  Hey, we have a spring break.  It's very cool.  I got the intelligence of a sister.  And we have a spring break.  Why is it so great?  We're going to last good bands.  Click.  Click.  Click.  I cannot change the friggin' channel faster. 
[00:22:30]  I don't care if there's 20 naked chicks behind them.  Yeah.  I can't get past...  You think...  How much sperm do you think it takes to get his hair like that?  Hey, you want to throw another batch of it?  Oh.  There's something about Mary in his head.  I mean...  Come on.  We got it.  We got to get the audio of Jesse.  Yeah.  Someone roll tape on MTV.  Yeah.  And then we'll put it on the air and then we'll go find it for another 20 minutes.  You could be a VJ too. 
[00:23:00]  Oh.  You cut out his brain!  You bastards!  All right, Anthony.  Stack or two.  Stack or two.  You need a boost of energy?  Mm-hmm.  Mm-hmm.  You all right, man?  Yeah, I'm on stack or two.  He has energy.  Look at him go.  Wow.  Now, you've taken this.  I took it today.  And it gives you the energy you need to make it through the day.  Yeah, it's helping me.  It is.  Gives me a nice little boost of energy just in time for the show. 
[00:23:30]  That's good.  And there you have it.  It also says it burns fat, Anthony.  Mm-hmm.  I guess if you're getting tired during the day, stack or two would be for you.  Yeah.  If you're looking for an energy boost, you could try stack or two.  If you're not happy, they'll give you your money back.  The company's in New Jersey.  You pop a pill.  Within an hour, you get a boost of energy.  And to order it, you could call 1-800-LIGHT-LINE.  The Rock of New York, 1027 WNEW, two for Tuesday, Aerosmith. 
[00:24:00]  Dude looks like a lady and dream on.  Those guys at the Oscars the other night.  That is weird, huh?  Yeah.  It was very strange.  I think they're kind of fitting into that whole thing these days.  I don't know.  Steven Tyler, you look like you fit in with the Oscars.  I don't mean that way.  I mean, just with the age bracket of the people that are there,  all that whole pomp and circumstance, hoity-toity,  up, stuck-up people.  Yeah.  I don't know.  He's kind of, he's not, he's in a, I don't know. 
[00:24:30]  I think he's getting, he's fitting into that category these days.  Like a sellout?  That damn soundtrack, man, to Armageddon.  Eh.  I don't know.  N.E.W.  Hey, yo, you guys know that that Aerosmith song they played on the Oscars  was written about Barbra Streisand and James Brolin, man?  I don't want to miss a thing?  Yeah, that's, that's actually, uh, James Brolin looking at Barbra Streisand  sleeping, man. 
[00:25:00]  I remember, I remember that whole thing.  I mean, yeah, I mean, you know, Opie said that Aerosmith's a rock band,  man, he ain't no rock band anymore.  Yeah, not anymore.  Did you check out Joe Perry's hair?  Uh, yeah.  Oh, my God.  What's going on there?  I mean, you know, I, I must say, I love Aerosmith, but.  Yeah.  He's got to do something.  In the 70s, they were great, man.  He's got to do something with that hair.  I'm wondering how many guys have been, uh, hitting on him lately with that hairdo.  No doubt.  Hey, you guys are great, man.  At least he chopped off that weird Fu Manchu thing he had going on. 
[00:25:30]  Yeah, yeah, right.  That strange, um, I don't know what it was.  It was like the, it was like the Hitler mustache were backwards.  Backwards.  Yeah, he shaved out the middle.  Shaved out the middle and had the rest.  Hey, wait a minute.  I want to know, is that really what that's about?  Yes.  Now, who wrote that?  Uh, you know, I don't know her name.  It's not coming to me right now, but it did, I saw it on like a Barber, uh, Walters.  Yeah, I remember this.  James Brolin was saying, uh, the, James Brolin, James Streisand.  Talk about the biggest pussy whip in the, on the face of the earth. 
[00:26:00]  What normal man looks at a freaking woman after he does her?  He's asleep, man.  Well, no, he said that, um, he looked at her one day.  Right.  And didn't want to go to sleep.  He goes, I don't want to go to sleep.  And Barber goes, well, why don't you want to go to sleep?  And that's what the song's about.  And he said, because.  Because I don't want to miss a thing.  Yeah, I'll miss you, and I don't want to miss looking at you while my eyes are closed. 
[00:26:30]  Jesus.  Oh.  Barber Streisand you're bedding down with, not Pamela Lee.  I know, right?  She's not even good to look at at Wake, anyway.  You know, remember the young James Brolin?  You just figured, you know, he was a cool guy back in the 70s, even.  What, Marcus Welby he was on?  Tough guy, man.  Tough guy.  You could get any chick he wanted.  And then he's, uh, Barber, I don't want to shut my eyes, because I'll miss you, sweetie.  And that's what that song's about?  That's what that song's about.  Oh, make me puke. 
[00:27:00]  That's an embarrassment.  I can't listen to that song anymore.  I want to punch the radio, man.  Ah.  Well, what'd you think of the Oscars?  I really don't watch that song, but I actually sat with my wife and watched it, and, uh,  I don't know, I almost threw something at the TV, man.  I can't take it.  You know, we got into a big fight and stuff, and she went running upstairs.  Wow, it's on the Oscars.  You know, I get pushed on the sports channel, you know?  It's so not real, and not anything any of us can relate to, these Hollywood bigwig jack-offs,  just parading around in their gowns and jewels. 
[00:27:30]  Yeah, but that's what, women love that, man.  Yeah, man.  It's a whole fashion show and stuff.  Yeah.  You know, I'm not sick of Roberto Benigni yet.  Oh, God, I can't take that guy anymore.  Come on.  As an Italian, I want him shot.  I go, this is great, marvelous, this is wonderful, I cannot believe you, America, you love me,  I love everybody, this is fabulous, I cannot, shut up!  Have you had enough of this guy?  You see that S, uh, oh, I can't, S eating grin, I almost slipped, that he had during the 
[00:28:00]  whole Oscars?  Yeah, he's like an Italian retard walking around.  It looks like a retard that you just, you know, brought to the zoo, and they just saw some  animals, and they're all happy and stuff.  Yeah, that's what he is, you know?  Look into me!  I just made a poopy in my pants, it's a beautiful thing!  Would you like to see the poopy in my pants?  And they all, everyone's like, the anchor, uh, doing the news, comes back from the clips 
[00:28:30]  of the Oscars, and they're like, they're all laughing, what spirit this man is, is he  great?  He just, he's so up all the time, who cares?  He's so wonderful!  I cannot believe you American people love me!  He's so fabulous!  How about that Robin Williams character, though, man?  Is anything he says funny at all?  No, no, no, no.  It never was.  It's unbelievable, man.  It never was, we were all tricked.  Even, even, uh, Whoopi Goldberg, I mean, nothing she said was even close to funny.  Whoopi is not funny, I don't think she ever has been. 
[00:29:00]  And, uh, she proved that last night, too.  Because, I mean, all she ever did was, was use, like, that, uh, her black slang thing,  and, uh, goofing on the president.  Right, and then the next minute.  And it's not washing.  And then the next minute, she talks like a white person.  Yeah.  Like a white person.  Oh, my goodness.  She's talking deep onics.  The next minute, she's talking like a white person.  Well, I know what you're trying to say.  But they got a little upset.  A few of the, uh, executives at the, uh, station got, uh, got upset because she was, uh, manipulating  the microphone at one point.  Really?  Like it was a, a penis? 
[00:29:30]  Yeah, when Liam, uh, Neeson was, uh, being introduced, she was stroking the, uh, microphone  like it was a big schlong.  Like Liam's gonna want a piece of you.  Yeah, like, that's a vision we need to see.  Oh, gosh, she's gotta wear baggy pants so her boobs can fit in her legs.  Those things are swinging.  What's that old joke?  What does, uh, Whoopi Goldberg, giving you a Hummer, and, uh, tightrope walking across  the Grand Canyon have in common?  What?  What?  And both you don't want to look down.  Right.  I love that guy. 
[00:30:00]  There it is!  There it is!  Oh, we're all in tape!  All right, man, take it easy.  Love you.  Yeah, there it is.  The Jesse commercial just came on.  Good, we have tape of it.  We have tape of it.  Get that on card immediately.  We got a goof on Jesse.  The spot they're running on MTV.  So there you go.  I don't know if there's anything else to talk about with the Oscars.  That was pretty lackluster, pretty boring.  There wasn't any, uh...  Dude, would you throw Sophia Loren one still or what?  No, stop with Sophia Loren.  Everybody's saying how, what a babe she is.  She's like a grandma.  She was...  She's like a great grandma.  I don't know, man. 
[00:30:30]  There was something going on there.  I don't know.  Dude, it's TV.  They cake stuff on.  They're pulling, tugging.  I don't know.  I don't know.  Yeah, you want to see that?  Hey, Whoopi, come to me.  Come over here.  And she takes it off in just like a mess?  You want to see that?  I don't know, man.  I think I'd go on.  I love Sophia.  She's so beautiful, isn't she?  Everybody's wonderful.  Why not?  I don't know, man.  You wouldn't throw Sophia one?  You have a problem.  James!  Hi, Eddie.  You love the old broads, man. 
[00:31:00]  All right, what do you got?  Sophia Loren's 80.  Did you hear about the Al Sharpton quote the other day?  No, what's the Al Sharpton quote?  When he was talking about he's going to do a hunger strike at Rikers Island.  Did you hear about that?  Really?  No.  Yeah, it was yesterday.  They quoted him because of the fact that if he's doing that march in Washington, D.C.  Right.  If that doesn't work, he's going to come back to New York, and he's going to do a hunger strike at Rikers Island.  Yeah, but like a whale, he could live off that blubber for years. 
[00:31:30]  Exactly.  Like camel with its ump.  I don't think he can go an hour without a meal.  That would be pretty damn funny to say.  I will continue this until we have justice.  Now, how long has it been?  Damn, my stomach's growling.  Right.  Now, does a hunger strike include yodels and ringdings?  Just want to clear that up.  What about a coffee cake?  I love them drinks coffee cake.  I need a value meal.  How about a happy meal?  Right.  All right.  I guess we'll take a break here. 
[00:32:00]  We have the Jesse clip now.  You just got to hear how retarded that...  Weren't there talented people that actually wanted to be VJs?  Well, honestly, there's a lot of kids, let's say, that are in broadcasting, and they worked their ass off four or five years in college, and they want a break in the business.  And it's almost an embarrassment.  You turn on the tube, you're working your ass off, and you see someone like Jesse on MTV.  Yeah.  You know?  I understand.  It's just taking up space, and there's a lot of people that really want to do that and would do a great job.  It's like the original Mercury astronauts, Opie. 
[00:32:30]  Very qualified, highly trained, and they were upset when they used to send the monkey up in the capsule.  Well...  It's the same thing.  They got a monkey running this job, pretty much.  Jesse, that's great.  You want to hear of Petty or the pumpkins?  Oh, God, I love Smashing Pumpkins.  That's a good band.  The Rock of New York, 1027, WNEW, two for Tuesday, Smashing Pumpkins, Cherub Rock, and 1979.  Hey, what we didn't touch on with the Oscars just before was the whole Lewinsky thing.  Yeah. 
[00:33:00]  Like, she went to all these parties.  Mm-hmm.  She got in her big, fat gown.  Yeah.  And went with Jonathan Marshall, I guess he's some entertainment lawyer or something in New York, and made the rounds of the parties.  That just goes to show you how screwed up this country is, and how screwed up that whole entertainment thing the Oscars are.  She is known for giving a hammer to the president.  Mm-hmm.  Period.  That's it.  Mm-hmm.  And now she's accepted by Hollywood's elite.  Hollywood's royal family, yeah. 
[00:33:30]  She is at these parties, Opie and I, we went to an Oscar party once.  Oh, we did, didn't we?  Yeah, remember?  Remember three or four years ago, Opie, remember that?  A radio station in Boston was kind enough to send us out to Los Angeles for the Oscars.  Yeah.  We interviewed a bunch of hacks.  We couldn't get near any of the stars.  Right.  So we figure, hey, there's the Oscar party at Spago.  Uh-huh.  We're going to Spago like everyone, like all the big Hollywood types, right? 
[00:34:00]  Yeah, we figured we're in L.A. and we're on the radio.  We're pretty important.  We'll get into this party.  Spago!  So we cart our asses down to Spago, where there's a line of geeks and freaks looking for celebrities.  And we realized at this point, we ain't getting in.  Of course not.  But at least we found a little, a two-by-six board up on two cinder blocks.  Yeah.  That put us a little higher than the crowd so we could gawk with the rest of the freaks.  Well, you got to explain, too.  That was kind of like the press area, sort of, Ant. 
[00:34:30]  Sort of.  I didn't understand what it was.  There was some paparazzi up there and some reporters.  So we're like, hey, we're on the radio.  We got these groovy-looking badges that look important.  Yeah.  We'll go into the press area as well.  Maybe we'll get a couple questions out, you know?  Yeah.  So we go from, you know, maybe having dinner with Madonna at Spago to, all right, we'll just stand on this board.  And just watch the celebrities come and go.  Gawk at people, sure.  Yeah.  We're up there no longer than, I guess, a minute.  Some big guy comes over and goes, hey, you can't stand on that. 
[00:35:00]  We got kicked off of the board in front of Spago.  Yeah.  We couldn't even stand on a two-by-six.  We weren't worthy enough to stand on a damn piece of wood.  But Madam Tonsil Hockey gets into all the parties with her big, fat, glittery dress.  Yeah.  Any stains on it that night, Monica?  Did Jonathan leave a stain?  You know what is more disgusting than all that? 
[00:35:30]  Katie Lang is quoting the paper today that she told Monica that she had a sex dream about her.  Sorry, Katie.  There seems to be something missing on your anatomy that she really likes.  Right.  Exactly.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Where's that?  Monica was seated under table 14.  That was, no, honestly, I'm not going to take credit for that.  Don't worry, because I know people heard it somewhere else.  That's Jay Leno's joke that he told a hundred people. 
[00:36:00]  Oh, really?  Every time you saw Jay Leno on TV, he was telling that same joke.  He was so proud of it.  Well, Monica, Monica Lewinsky, she's seated under table 14.  Isn't that funny?  Check, please.  Check, please.  What a buffoon.  Well, there you have it.  How about that Monica Lewinsky, people?  Yeah.  You know she was seated under table 14.  What a mess.  What?  What do you got, a little note?  Phone call?  I don't know. 
[00:36:30]  Kevin, you got to, like, print, I think.  Yeah, what is he writing in cursive?  Yeah, it's like...  Give me that.  Let me see.  All right.  Come on, get out of here.  Kevin's like, our intern, he's great.  He's screening the course.  Now, read what it says.  Wait, wait.  He scribbled out the first two?  Yeah.  And you can't tell what he scribbled to what he wants you to read.  Yeah.  Because it looks like the scribble.  Fine and good...  What?  To speak to...  Oh, you have issues.  You have some problems. 
[00:37:00]  Any W, what do you have?  You should go over to MTV, see if you can be a VJ.  Hey, over, it's Shannon.  Who is it?  My name's Dennis.  Hey, Dennis, what's up?  Just touching upon the Monica Lewinsky thing.  Yeah.  I was watching Good Morning America yesterday, and one of the ladies was there, and she said  she couldn't even get to Monica.  There was a huge line, and supposedly Monica's hanging out with Madonna.  Yeah.  You know, I'm not a huge Madonna fan, but all of a sudden, Madonna was, like, kind of tossed  aside because Monica was there.  Yeah.  I think Madonna's done more for our society than... 
[00:37:30]  Not much.  ...than Monica.  But that's how we think of this country, you know?  Yeah.  It's Monica.  Everyone wanted to see Monica.  Yeah.  And she's known for one thing.  The presidential schween.  She has embraced it, loved it.  Yeah.  Serviced it.  Yes.  And that's what's making her famous right now.  Ugh.  They're taking pictures of her, and meanwhile, presidential penis is ready to launch missiles  into Yugoslavia.  This is great.  There you have it. 
[00:38:00]  Is anybody interested in that maybe we're going insane as a country?  Maybe we're just insane now?  President getting ready to shoot his load once again.  What?  His load of missiles.  Yeah.  His military load.  Of course.  That's right.  I will take my missile and thrust it right into Kosovo.  Kosovo.  Who's she?  I like them foreign broads.  When can I get some of that Kosovo?  Yeah.  Get some.  Get some.  Well, you know, his wife and daughter are out of the country. 
[00:38:30]  That's what I hear.  Yes.  Africa, is it?  They're taking a little 12-day trip of Africa.  They've been over there a lot.  Yeah.  There's so many countries to visit on the globe, and for some reason, they went a while  back, and now they're going again.  Mm-hmm.  Hmm.  Now, interestingly enough, I think we have exclusive audio, Anthony.  I don't doubt it.  Why wouldn't we?  We got audio of Hillary and Chelsea in Africa.  I can't wait to hear it.  We'll be playing that a little later on in the show.  Also, where's Black Earl?  Where is he? 
[00:39:00]  Where's Earl?  We got to talk to him today.  He's rejoicing that his pictures, the pictures of him getting disciplined by Spike, were  kicked off the web page.  Well, a lot of people sending instant feedback saying, hey, man, why aren't you telling your  faithful listeners that you guys got censored again?  We talked about it earlier in the show.  We got censored by, what, WebJump?  WebJump was WebDump to me, and they took our pictures off, and we ran down, we read down  the list of reasons that you might get dumped off of WebJump, and the only one that fit was 
[00:39:30]  obscene material.  Yes.  They can judge what's obscene.  And the Supreme Court still has not decided what obscene is.  Can't define it.  But WebJump has realized that maybe that Mentos video was obscene.  That was classic.  I showed so many people that this weekend.  People liked that one.  Big time.  Well, we're going to find another server, I guess, because that's the sixth one we've  been kicked off of.  Yeah, seven's a charm.  So don't worry.  We'll get the pictures back eventually when we find a cool server.  Now, where's Earl?  Is he still in the building?  He's in the back. 
[00:40:00]  All right.  Well, here's the deal, because we're running so late.  Let's just play a few spots, and we'll come back, hopefully, with Earl.  Okay.  Instead of music.  Is that cool?  That sounds good.  Can we handle that?  You're going to perpetuate these rumors, Opie.  What's that, Anthony?  By not playing music.  What?  No one's talking about that.  I read something in the paper.  Huge article in the Daily News.  Yeah.  Rumor has it.  We're going all talk.  We had the boss on earlier, and he didn't confirm or deny the rumor.  He's out right now looking to whack the staffers that spoke with the Daily News. 
[00:40:30]  Yeah.  Our boss will do that.  You'll find two people that worked here in the river, floating in the East River.  Well, we've got a bunch of rats on the staff.  We know that already.  A bunch of rats going to the press, talking about our private meetings, staff meetings.  That's just stupid.  All right.  It's Opie.  It's Anthony, and it's our buddy, our pal, Earl.  Black Earl, everyone.  What's up, man?  What's happening?  Earl can't stay long.  He's very busy.  He's working very diligently today. 
[00:41:00]  Well, everyone's getting ready for the Dave Matthews thing tomorrow.  Yes.  We have tickets to give away?  Yeah, we do.  We forgot to give away our tickets last hour.  Oh, we can do that.  We'll do that.  But, Earl, I notice you're still standing.  You haven't sat down since Friday?  I'm in pretty good shape, actually.  Are you?  Yeah.  Were you sore at all this weekend from your beating from Spike?  A little sore in the groin area, but I don't find.  She was stepping on him with high-heeled Spike heels.  Yeah.  Are you sore from the high heels or from the, what was that? 
[00:41:30]  I never used to like.  Well, don't get too happy.  Don't get yourself too attached to.  Oh, great.  The current format.  We're teasing, of course.  No, all I'm saying is, like, I like certain kinds of music.  Oh, this is the line you've got to, this is what you've got to listen to when you're, like, in a bar trying to pick up at shit.  You've got to listen to these stories.  I know.  We're, we're like the guy with the Coke to the Coke whore right now.  Like, she'll say anything to us.  No, this wasn't, this wasn't.  Why?  New York has, like, such an incredible music scene. 
[00:42:00]  You know, in the bar, Ope, you've got to sit and listen, like, yeah.  Yeah, and meanwhile, you're just going, God, I hope this pans out.  Yeah, because in your head, you're thinking, man, I wonder what you're making.  Yeah, yeah.  So, you, you, like, act really interested.  Yeah, the music scene in New York.  Damn, the, damn the music scene.  Yes, it does suck.  God, we are so much alike.  No.  You know, we are so much alike.  I love puppies, too.  I love puppies.  I love gay magic, and I don't care what you think.  I love them.  I love them.  I travel thousands of miles. 
[00:42:30]  Yes, yes, we know.  We know.  In London, in Amsterdam, and I've seen them here.  I want to see them tomorrow.  Yes.  I put her on hold.  No, I agree.  Yes, the tampon, much better than the pad.  Am I getting laid tonight?  Please, so I can finish this conversation.  All right, she's probably freaked out because we put her on hold.  We're on delay.  Hold on.  Hello?  Hello?  Hi.  Hi, I thought we lost you there. 
[00:43:00]  No, I'm listening to you.  Put me on the radio.  Oh, my God.  Look at her.  Now she's listening to herself.  Now she's back on hold.  Now, obviously, we didn't even ask her the question,  but it's so obvious she's not going to get it.  Right.  But now she's a huge Dave Matthews fan.  Hi, who's this?  Hi, my name's Jim.  Hi, Jim.  How are you?  Good, good.  I'm calling.  This lady's so annoying, man. 
[00:43:30]  No, really?  Can I ask you a question?  All right, look.  Isn't it?  It's just like every girl.  You try to pick up in a bar.  Yeah, man, and you just got to put up with it.  You got to because you're trying.  You're working it.  Yeah.  No, I do understand.  Yeah.  Yes.  No, tell me about how your father screwed you over again.  God, I love that.  Yeah, you're not.  I sympathize so much.  Oh, you poor thing.  If I could work up a tear, I'm in.  And inside your head, you have this hourglass, you know.  Yeah, and it's going down like your schween. 
[00:44:00]  All right, so what's your deal with Dave Matthews?  Yeah, I think they're a great band.  I'm a fan of your show.  And I'll take a stab at the Viagra question.  All right.  We made an analogy about Viagra when it first hit in the summer.  Like acid?  No.  That's a good one, though.  It was close.  All right, man.  Thanks.  Bye.  This is a hard one, man.  Hi, N.E.W.  Hi, I'm calling.  It's when the Dave Matthews tickets. 
[00:44:30]  All right, what's your name?  Michael.  Hi, Michael.  Where are you calling from?  I'm in my car in the northern state.  I just left Huntington.  How's the traffic?  It's not bad.  All right, cool.  You got an answer to the O&A trivia question?  I didn't hear the actual, they were comparing Viagra to something.  Yeah, we did an analogy about Viagra when we first...  Oh, is this Obie?  Yeah.  Hey, I was at the Longshore Brewery a couple weeks ago.  Right on, man.  All right, good time.  You got an answer, dude?  Because your phone's crapping out on us.  Oh, you compared it to crack?  No.  All right, man.  We got to go. 
[00:45:00]  Your phone sucks.  Okay, so thanks.  All right, here's the deal.  Here's the deal.  Yeah.  We'll take two more callers.  Yeah.  If they know the answer, they get the tickets, flat out.  If not, I'm going to give it to the huge Dave Matthews fan.  I figured you would do that.  Is that cool?  That sounds okay.  All right.  She's going to freak now if someone gets this.  Because she's still listening.  Yeah.  Hi, N.A.W.  N.A.W.  Yeah.  All right, what's your name?  My name's Mike.  All right, Mike, do you know the answer to the O&A trivia question?  I do.  I do.  Oh, Jesus.  Uh-oh. 
[00:45:30]  No, I was listening.  All right, we need an answer, dude.  All right.  Put the bong down.  Yeah.  It was.  Viagra was compared to.  He's just, he's milking.  Oh, I do now.  I forgot.  I know.  All right.  Thanks.  All right.  It's compared to the thing that you guys once called a.  Oh, my God.  All right, what's your.  All right, this is the link.  I know, man.  They're such ding-dong.  All right, what's your name again?  You didn't know my name in the first place.  Oh, yeah.  What's your name?  Laura. 
[00:46:00]  Laura, the annoying caller.  Laura, the annoying Dave Matthews fan.  You're going to regret that.  All right, Laura, here's the deal.  I'm putting you on hold.  Okay.  If the next person doesn't know the answer, then you got the tickets for this private show.  Dude, leave her on the line.  All right.  Let's let her live through this horror.  I'm stressing while I listen to the radio.  All right.  All right.  Stay on the line.  Hold on.  All right.  I hope he gets it.  I got to make this work.  I hope he gets it.  Laura?  Laura?  Yeah.  Okay, hold on.  Hold on.  I hope this works.  All right.  All right.  All right.  Hold up on her. 
[00:46:30]  Hold on.  Wait a minute.  Laura?  It's Laura.  All right.  Hold on.  Who's this?  It's Laura.  Hold on, everyone.  Goddamn phone.  It's like mission control over there.  Oh, we've lost Houston.  All right.  When we go all talk, I hope they fix the phone.  All right.  Laura?  Yeah?  All right.  Hold on a line.  I'm going to try this again.  All right.  All right.  Hi.  Who's this?  This is Kyle.  All right, Kyle.  Hold on.  What a pain in the ass. 
[00:47:00]  All right, Laura.  Yeah?  Kyle.  Yes?  All right.  Cool.  All right, Laura, shut up, all right?  I'm not saying anything.  All right.  I just wanted to say...  Shut up.  Believe me, it was a preemptive shut up.  We knew it was coming.  Preemptive shh.  All right.  Go ahead.  Kyle, for the day...  Where are you calling from, Kyle?  I'm in Manhattan.  All right.  For the day, Matthews...  Are you a big Opie and Anthony fan?  Huge.  Guys are hilarious.  And how long have you been listening?  About three, four months.  Oh, see?  Okay, this could be good, then.  This could be good.  Could be good for the girl. 
[00:47:30]  All right, Kyle, what is the answer to the O&A trivia question?  We'll give it to you again.  When Viagra hit the scene in the summer, we made an analogy of what it was like.  Uh, ecstasy?  No.  Eh!  Oh, man.  Come on, guys.  I'm going all day.  Oh, sorry, man.  Can't take two people.  Laura?  Yeah?  You're going.  Yeah!  Yeah!  Look at her.  Listen to her.  She's squealing. 
[00:48:00]  Yes!  Oh, yes!  Thank you.  Thank you.  To be honest, I wanted to give it to you from the beginning because you're too cool.  Oh, stop.  What are you trying to pick her off?  Yeah, listen to her.  Is she hot?  I got to know.  Wow.  She almost went from, like, being real excited about Dave Matthews to having, like, an orgasm.  I know.  Oh, Dave, Dave.  I'll tell you something.  Yeah.  Yes, Joe.  I was calling all of us.  Oh, here we go.  Oh, here we go.  I won't talk because you're going to just make fun of me anyhow. 
[00:48:30]  Don't be mad.  Oh.  What'd she say?  Now she's all pissed.  Don't be pissed.  What, are we married?  I just don't want this whole thing to be on the radio.  My friend's probably at work going, oh, my God, that's Laura.  Yeah.  Oh, my God, bless you.  I'm so shocked.  What's the station that was...  All right, listen, we got to...  Yeah, we got to do the big contest outro.  We got to do the tagline, you know, when, like, Z100 and all those go, what's your fiber  radio station?  Oh, ho.  I'm so happy.  My heart's being so happy. 
[00:49:00]  All right, listen, Laura, what's the radio station that wants to see your balloon not?  W-N-E-W?  Yeah.  Oh.  All right.  How do we do this?  All right, hold on the line.  Okay.  Hopefully I won't hang up on you.  And you got the text for Dave Matthews.  Thank you.  We'll see you tomorrow with Ralph the Tour, all right?  All right.  Laura's on line five.  Wow.  That's cool.  I'm exhausted just listening to her.  Well, the Viagra analogy, eh, it's good, but we got to take a break. 
[00:49:30]  Yeah.  Maybe we'll do it a little later.  How's that?  Okay, we'll fill you in on that.  Yeah.  You want to hear, wow, Pearl Jam or ACDC next?  It depends on the Pearl Jam.  I've heard some, like, Pearl Jam is very iffy with me.  Sometimes I love it, but there are some songs I cannot sit through.  Jeremy and Nothing Man.  Those are pretty good.  ACDC, you shook me all night long, or Money Talks?  Hmm.  I've heard those enough.  Really?  I've heard all four enough, to tell you the truth.  Well, when we go all talk, you won't have to worry about it. 
[00:50:00]  Stop perpetuating rumors!  Well, everyone else is talking about it in the city.  Let's make believe we don't know anything about it.  We're not supposed to talk about such things, I'll bite you.  All right, Pearl Jam or ACDC?  You said Pearl Jam?  Go with the Pearl Jam.  All right, we'll be back.  All right, we'll take a little musical break here.  On the way next, some audio from Hillary and Chelsea's trip to Africa.  It's an Opie and Anthony exclusive.  In the meantime, it's Two for Tuesday.  The Rock of New York, 1027 WNEW, Two for Tuesday with Pearl Jam, Nothing Man, and Jeremy. 
[00:50:30]  I just love hearing you say that.  What, Two for Tuesday?  Two for?  A two for everyone.  It's a two for on this Tuesday, on this Two for Tuesday.  Care!  Hey, stop it.  You're not supposed to say things like that.  I've been yelled at.  See, we're able to, with the two fers, get, you know, the second cut could be more of a tastier, a tastier cut.  Let's see.  Opie, tasty two for Tuesday cut for you, tasty tune on a tasty two for Tuesday. 
[00:51:00]  When are we going to start doing Black Party Weekends?  That's what I want to know.  Hey, get the lead out.  Let's get the lead out.  All right.  You know, I was a goof when I was working in Buffalo Radio.  You know, because every station was getting the lead out.  That was the big thing.  Right.  I played three in a row from Led Zeppelin called Get the Lead Out.  It would be zanerific radio.  I started a thing in Buffalo called Mandatory Metallica. 
[00:51:30]  Mandatory Metallica?  That was you?  Yeah, that was me.  Oh, that's taken over the whole country.  I've heard that.  That's the latest, so.  All right.  Well, we could play the audio from Chelsea and Hillary.  Clinton, they're over there in Africa.  We got some exclusive audio.  Okay.  Or we could go to the phones and talk to our drunk friend, Jay.  Jay's on the phone, huh?  Well, you hung out with Jay this weekend, right?  I was up in Massachusetts.  Yeah, I hung out with Jay.  And it's always a common theme when we're hanging out. 
[00:52:00]  It's very funny.  We got to explain, Jay.  Anthony and I, very good friends off the air.  This is not like a little, you know, goof we do.  You know, we act like we like each other on the radio and then hate each other like every other team in New York.  And we have one friend.  Yeah.  One friend.  We've known each other for five years.  We have one friend.  That's true.  And it's Drunken Jay.  Drunken Jay.  Drunken Jay.  He's not drunk now.  No, I'm not.  Thank you. 
[00:52:30]  Make him sound like he's drunk all the time.  Thanks a lot.  I know.  Isn't that great?  It's so funny because, like, when I hang out with Jay, we do, like, athletic stuff.  That's true.  You do maybe some rollerblading.  Or, you know, we'll, yeah, walk the streets and check out record stores and stuff.  Right.  Right.  Now, when Anthony hangs out with Jay, it's just drinking and brunch and throwing darts at things you're not supposed to throw darts at.  Yeah, the liver has to really get in tune before we hang. 
[00:53:00]  There are, we're still doing sporting events, but they take on a whole new, I don't know.  Well, now, this is a theme that is running through because since we've been back in New York, I go up there to visit because my wife Jennifer's family still lives up there.  So we go on little outings.  The first one you may have remembered was the Renaissance Festival that I went on.  Now, so it wouldn't just be me and Jen and my mother-in-law and maybe Annie Marg, who was at the original Renaissance. 
[00:53:30]  So the festival was a whole new thing to her.  It was cold.  She told us it was accurate.  Yeah, it was a revival for her.  Oh, King Richard.  I did him.  So we went to that.  Well, we're drinking beer like crazy.  We were just like big steins.  We turned into those nights.  By the end of the day, we're tanked throwing hatchets at wood.  It was supposed to be at the wood.  Then we're just picking targets. 
[00:54:00]  Bet you can't hit that tree.  I stand about six feet tall.  There was a tall girl right next to me.  And I miss that.  I'm talking the hatchet just bounces off the wall.  And this teenager who just handed me four hatchets while I put down two beers to get them.  Dude, why don't you like move back a step or two?  So now the hatchet is eagle with her head.  And I whip it.  And it just goes right past her ear. 
[00:54:30]  But of course, she had a few.  And she was laughing, too.  Everyone was laughing at the hatchets and the drunk people.  Now, you guys almost got kicked out of a bar Sunday.  Well, no, you've got to remember now, there was another time we visited where me and Jen and Jay figured we'd go bowling.  But we couldn't find you can't find cool, regular bowling up there.  So we had to do that fag candle pin bowling with a tiny ball.  Yeah, the ball is like the size of a softball.  The pins are little candlesticks.  And you whip this ball down there.  So, of course, drinking. 
[00:55:00]  And then at one point, Jay bet me that he could take this candle pin ball, throw it down, which is a regulation lane.  Alley, same length.  Without hitting the lane, the ball will land in the center of the pins, thus scoring a strike.  I couldn't get the money out of my pocket fast enough to see this.  He shot puts this thing.  He gave it a little too much.  It hit the sign.  You know those big signs over the alleys that say, like, you know, Junior League bowling starts here? 
[00:55:30]  He hit it to let it, like alphabet soup.  They're falling all over every other lane.  We started unlacing our shoes at that point.  We were out of there quicker than a chippy at one of Fredo's get-togethers.  Godfather reference.  Godfather reference.  We love Godfather references.  So now I'm up there this weekend.  So we decide to catch some brunch.  This is the Sunday tradition.  We go to this small place that has a little brunch and drinks that are made like just don't smoke near them. 
[00:56:00]  So what were you drinking?  You were drinking those vodka grapefruits.  They call it a great greyhound.  A greyhound.  But it's basically a big thing of vodka with some yellow food coloring.  And I had, like, some Bloody Marys and stuff.  And then we decided we'd hit the bar down the road to play some darts.  Wait, can I explain the bar?  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  It's a bloodbath.  I've been there.  It's called Green Acres. 
[00:56:30]  Yeah.  And this is a place that has all-out bar fights every weekend.  It's a small local place, but they need bouncers in the place because somebody will always be dragged out kicking.  It looks like one of those old Burt Reynolds movies every Friday night and Saturday night.  Just insane.  And on Monday, they're replacing the panes of glass outside every single Monday.  I'm not exaggerating.  This place is just a sick bar.  Exactly.  People get kicked into this bar.  Now, so the story goes, you guys went there Sunday. 
[00:57:00]  Sunday after brunch.  You almost got kicked out of this bar.  Almost got kicked out.  No one gets kicked out of this bar.  Well, we're playing darts because that's what we went there for.  Oh, and yes, two to drink.  And the game of darts just didn't seem exciting enough, so we had to play it from the table we were sitting at across the room,  which still wasn't bad because we were trying to hit the dartboard.  Then it got to the point where Jay starts taking the chalk that you score with and making X's on various things around the bar.  And we're betting a buck a shot who can get closest to his X. 
[00:57:30]  So it's like the fire extinguisher, lap, lap, boom, boom, my buck.  You know, you hit the guy coming out of the bathroom.  It doesn't matter if he passed the extinguisher.  It has to hit the extinguisher.  It was a mess.  People were walking right by us.  You're the one, though.  Hey, try to hit the outlet.  Yeah, yeah.  And you know what?  I was so bad off, I just said, you know what?  There's no way I'm going to hit it anyway, so I just threw it anyway.  And Jen was giving us looks like. 
[00:58:00]  She was getting pissed.  And then the owner of the place was like, you know, keep this up.  You're going to have to leave.  We don't want your time.  And, of course, I turned around and just said, come to the service party.  Told him.  Hey, Jay, St. Paddy's Day wasn't the same this year without you.  Oh, man, I'm sure.  We went to.  I'm sure there's a lot left over.  Well, it wasn't like last year with the kids blowing off the fireworks in the streets and stuff.  No, Southie in Boston, very Irish down there. 
[00:58:30]  And, yeah, they celebrate St. Paddy's Day different.  I think they're training the children for the IRA.  I swear to God, we were walking down the streets of Southie in Boston, St. Paddy's Day.  These kids, I don't know where they got these things.  They were called bomb packs.  I kid you not.  It's a package that you pull this little string out of and then throw it.  And 10 seconds later, it blows up.  It makes like a little, you know, little kiddie explosion, but it in fact blows up.  And I hear some of the fathers going, no, soon, this is how you do it. 
[00:59:00]  First, you got to put the hood in the car and put it in the car.  But that'll get the British bastard.  It's the queen.  I was like, dude, you're in Massachusetts.  Hey, we have some fun when alcohol's involved, don't we?  That was some fun.  Yeah.  All right.  All right, man, we'll be up there, you know, soon.  All right.  See you again.  Think up some other sport maybe we could do. 
[00:59:30]  Well, we're trying to hire Drunken Jay for our show.  Maybe crowded street javelin throw.  I like that.  Anything else to add, Jay?  No.  You don't want to infuse us back or anything?  All done?  Uh, no.  No.  I'm so drunk to do it.  Still, of course, because it's our friend Drunk Jay.  Thanks a lot.  Poor guy.  Come on.  What a name.  Guy's a well-respected man in the community.  In what community?  Well, the drunk community, but it is a community. 
[01:00:00]  Yeah, I'm the town drunk.  But let's pull that old one out.  Now, Otis, back in the sale.  Oh, no.  I'm out of here.  He's done.  Now he's mad.  All right, we'll see you soon, man.  All right, man.  Later.  Later.  It's our pal.  Jay, our only pal.  I've got to go two states away just to hang out and drink with somebody.  The Rock of New York, 1027 WNEW.  Two for Tuesday.  ACDC.  Money Talks in.  You shook me all night long. 
[01:00:30]  It's Opie.  It's Anthony.  Hey.  And it's Australian Mark in the studio.  Good day.  How's it going?  Good day.  Good day.  You don't even know what that was.  I think we need to explain that.  On the way, a chance to win Dave Matthews tickets.  Mark just cursed.  He couldn't tell?  If he was on Australian.  It doesn't count.  Yeah.  If he was on Australian radio, he wouldn't have gotten away with what he just said.  Exactly.  Or would you?  Hey, how now are you?  Are the rules strict down there? 
[01:01:00]  No, they're not.  No, it's a little more relaxed here.  Well, who cares if a kangaroo is you?  Well, we invited Mark onto the show today.  Everyone always pictures kangaroos.  That's all that's down there.  Hey, how are the kangaroos?  Run to school every day.  Every day.  Koalas, man.  Oh, yeah.  The koalas, too.  Come on.  And that crazy guy that's on the Discovery Channel.  Here we go.  I'm going into the hole now.  I'm going to pull him out by his balls. 
[01:01:30]  What's that crazy guy's name?  I'm going to stick my arm here in the crocodile's mouth.  The crocodile hunter, yeah.  I'm going to pull his tonsils out.  I don't recommend you do this at home.  It's like, yeah, I'm going to go down the street and go catch the croc and roll him.  Well, we got Mark in the studio because...  Anything's better than throwing another shrimp on the barbie.  That's all.  Yeah.  Oh, how many times do you have to hear that?  And have you ever had a Vegemite sandwich?  I love the stuff.  You've got to be winged on it, though.  What is Vegemite?  It's like a yeast, black soy sauce paste extract. 
[01:02:00]  Oh, stop.  My mouth is watering.  Very salty, but you're raised on it.  Yeah.  It's an acquired taste.  Kind of like the next day after you eat White Castle.  Yeah, that's acquired.  Now, you finished Half-Life.  Yeah.  Yeah, I did indeed.  We were talking about this before.  Yeah, we brought Mark in because, like myself, he's going through withdrawals because this weekend I finished Tomb Raider 3.  Yes.  I started Christmas Day, so it was three months. 
[01:02:30]  Three months.  Yes.  Half-Life is about your time, right?  That's what I say.  Yeah, it took me three months to finish Half-Life, yes.  And I had no life for that period of time.  So the Half-Life is you spend half your life playing and the other half trying to catch up on sleep.  Life has returned.  I feel empty.  It took me three months or just under to finish Tomb Raider 3.  Yeah.  And this weekend I got a lot of stuff done.  I'm like, wow, free time. 
[01:03:00]  Yeah, time on your hands now, huh?  It is so bizarre.  For the first time I worked on our radio show in three months.  Yeah, I realized that when I was watching Ally McBeal last night.  Yeah.  I was like, damn, why am I doing this?  It is so bizarre.  It's like an addiction.  It starts out, these video games or whatever, it just starts out as a stress relief, you know, a little bit of fun.  Recreation.  Recreation, a little entertainment instead of watching the boob tube and stuff.  By the end of the game, it's an addiction.  You have to finish.  It took the first couple of weeks and it becomes an obsession. 
[01:03:30]  Yeah.  Yeah.  You cross that line where you start dreaming about it.  Mm-hmm.  It's bad.  Oh, it's bad.  How are you going to get through that next little chorus?  Right.  I turned you on to this.  So I felt like I was the drug dealer.  You were?  Bringing you on.  Come on, man.  Give me a hit.  I need a clue, man.  Come on.  Yeah, yeah.  Give me.  I got to get through this part, man.  The monster's around the corner.  I have no ammo.  Does the grenade go under the cab or under the tank or over the tank?  Yeah, how do I blow it up? 
[01:04:00]  Now, come on.  That's up to you.  I fronted you enough information.  But I felt that way when I first went into electronics boutique to pick up a game.  I walk in and I'm looking through the games.  And the guy comes over and goes, hey, man, you're looking for a game?  Yeah, yeah.  Check this out.  Hands me the half-life box.  He's going, this is some good.  I'm like, yeah?  He goes, it's the best in the place.  I'm like, all right, thanks.  I almost like put it under my jacket and snuck out.  No, I paid for it. 
[01:04:30]  Then I got home and my relationship paid for it.  Because I was on there for 12 hours straight a lot of times.  And when you finish, you do.  You feel like, oh, great.  Now what?  You know?  It's a big letdown.  It's like a drug because you lose all your relationships.  Yes, relationship definitely suffers.  Your work suffers.  No sleep.  No sleep.  No sleep.  Just like crack cocaine.  You are a crackhead.  Yeah.  With these games.  I understand.  I'm with you.  But now I got all this free time. 
[01:05:00]  I don't know what to do.  I'm going to have to get another one.  I'm going to have to get another fix.  It's a stepping stone.  You need a bigger and better one.  That's the problem with half-life because I can't find one that's really as good.  I met my wife last night.  You're back with her, right?  She's looking good after this much time.  I don't know.  I'm thinking siphon filter for PlayStation.  That looks good for PlayStation because I got the PlayStation.  We need Team Fortress 2 to come out.  Half-Life Team Fortress 2.  We need it now, man.  Coming out now, man.  I'm hurting real bad.  Yo, Sierra, I'm hurting real bad. 
[01:05:30]  I need this.  You don't understand, man.  Look, I got a camera and a telescope.  I'll sell it to you.  I just need it.  You know, I must say, too, when I completed Tomb Raider 3, it was a big letdown.  I was expecting some huge bells and whistles.  Fanfare.  I was expecting you finish the game and all of a sudden the screen just goes, and there's  like a number or something you have to call because you finished the game, right?  And then you can only get this number if you get to the end of the game.  And you dial up the number and this hot blonde comes over and gives you oral favors for free 
[01:06:00]  for finishing the game.  Oh, come on.  Well, I was expecting more than a stupid helicopter comes down and takes her away, and that's  the end of the game.  Oh, is that what happened?  I thought it was going to open up the treasure, man.  Well, we got like the smoking man from the show.  Yeah, yeah.  Throughout the whole game, you'll be playing.  You're battling these huge beasts.  And then you look up.  You're dying.  You're being shot.  You're being blown up.  You're trying to kill somebody.  You glance up at a balcony, and there's a guy in a suit walking by looking at you.  Yeah.  And you take a few pot shots at him.  Doesn't hurt him. 
[01:06:30]  Yeah.  So finally, at the end, you get to meet this guy, and he tells you what the whole thing  was, fills you in, and then tells you you want to keep working for him, or you've got  a decision to make.  You make the wrong decision, you end up back with a bunch of monsters.  You make the right one, you go on to the sequel, I guess.  I don't know.  See, I was expecting, like, Lara Croft to come over and give me a personal lap dance for  finishing this game.  I wouldn't have a lap dance remark.  She'll shoot you.  That's true.  But it was a letdown.  I was expecting something serious.  Well, you need your next fix. 
[01:07:00]  Yeah.  You have a real empty feeling now.  Well, but the end of an addiction is never a happy moment.  You need more.  More, more, more.  It just means you need more.  Yeah.  You can't be satisfied.  You're addicted.  Hi, N.E.W., we need video game rehab.  Hey, what's going on?  I don't have a problem.  What are you talking about?  Yeah.  I just need more games.  What's up, buddy?  What's going on?  All right.  I got a suggestion.  Oh, dude, I got a great Half-Life story, actually.  Okay.  I finally beat the game.  You did?  About a month ago.  All right.  And after I beat the big guy, my sound kicked out, so I couldn't hear what that dude with 
[01:07:30]  the glasses and the briefcase was saying.  Uh-oh.  So, I just spent months playing this thing, and I couldn't figure out what the end was.  Oh, my God.  It was the secret to life.  Oh, you missed it.  Oh, well, try again.  So, I finally beat it the other day, and it was kind of like a letdown again.  Yeah, I know.  It was kind of like, he was like, would you like to, Gordon, would you like to join us,  or would you like to, you know, fight the monsters again? 
[01:08:00]  So, I joined him, and then the screen went black.  Yeah, well, and it's for the sequel, I guess.  I don't know.  All right.  What are you guys going through with Jarl, huh?  Oh, yeah.  I got a good, uh...  Real bad.  I got a quick game.  Okay.  That, uh, that could possibly help you.  It's, uh, StarCraft.  StarCraft, I know.  Yeah, I'm not into StarCraft.  Drunk J, our friend, plays that.  Yeah, I'm not into that one.  You're not into the strategy games?  Well, I don't know.  I'm looking at Siphon Filter for PlayStation, I think.  I like first-person perspective.  Quake, too.  We need, uh, the new get-up pretty good, too. 
[01:08:30]  Yeah, I know.  It's like we need the methadone of video games right now.  It's like Quake.  Quake, too, is a methadone for me.  It's not quite filling me in, giving me the buzz that Half-Life did.  Mm-hmm.  But I need something.  And then I have my Half-Life, uh, team, uh, Fortress coming out.  Right.  And then Half-Life multiplayer that I'm on every night.  Mm-hmm.  So, uh, you know, I'm getting along.  I'm not feeling totally fulfilled, but, you know, it's working for now.  One day at a time!  Oh, man. 
[01:09:00]  It's hard.  It's hard.  It really is.  I don't know what to do with myself tonight.  But, yeah.  Well, you'll figure out.  I almost threw the PlayStation through the window.  You get those moments.  Well, like I said, it starts out as a fun game, and by the end, you want to kill somebody.  Literally.  You're so pissed off.  I was never a computer game sort of guy before this.  Right.  It just kills you.  But I was doing Tomb Raider 3, and I was going further and further into the game one day, right?  And I was getting really far, and I'm like, should I save the game here?  Don't have enough save, Crystal.  Should I save?  It was a big decision.  I'm like, no, I'll go a little further. 
[01:09:30]  Went a little further.  I'm like, should I save here?  No, no, no.  I'll go a little further.  Keep going, right?  Now I'm finally ready to save the game.  The lights flicker in my house.  Oh, no.  And it goes off.  And I'm like, this has got to be a can of camera.  Where's the damn camera?  I looked at the TV in shock as it pops back on, where I was, you know, before I started the day's work.  And now Merv is on.  I almost threw the PlayStation through the living room window.  I'm like, you've got to be kidding.  You've got to be kidding me. 
[01:10:00]  You'll get annoyed.  I have to start over at that point.  That's part of the anger and anxiety of an addiction, Opie.  Right.  When it doesn't go your way.  All right.  Now, did you cheat a little?  Yeah, of course I cheated.  You always got to cheat a little.  Because I was talking to people about Tomb Raider 3 and stuff, and, you know, I had my fun.  I figured out a lot of the game on my own.  But it got to the point.  Did I have to play the game perfect so I could brag that I was, you know, I figured every single part of it by myself?  Of course I cheated a little.  Yeah.  When I had fun, sure.  You know, I jumped online and got some walkthroughs and stuff. 
[01:10:30]  Of course.  There you go.  All right.  Well, you've got to hook up a multiplayer.  We'll get into it.  We'll do some battle.  My little method.  Team Fortress.  Yeah.  We'll get through, Max.  We'll get through.  All right.  What is...  Hi, Andy W.  Hi, I'm still on ball.  All right.  What's up?  Not anymore.  Who is this?  Opie and Anthony.  Hello.  How are you?  Good.  I can't believe I'm actually getting to speak to you.  Cool.  I've been calling for days, and every time I call, people slam the phone out.  Oh, no.  Really? 
[01:11:00]  And they're rude to me, and they say they're busy.  They have no time.  Oh, well, what you have to say must be very important.  Well, no.  It was just my feelings were hurt, and I couldn't understand.  Why were your feelings hurt?  Because nobody would talk to me, and every time I hear you guys on the radio, you're  so nice to everybody.  Everybody's so nice, and I'm like...  Okay, now we're listening.  I've been calling all...  For like four days now to try to win tickets, and that's all I wanted to do, and I said,  all right, I gave up on that.  I just want to speak to them, tell them I love their show.  I have a great time listening to them.  I even sent you an email, and I couldn't get through, and the guy says, now they're busy. 
[01:11:30]  He just slams the phone down on me, and I said, oh, jeez.  Yeah.  That's kind of cruddy that they do that.  So I was, you know, yeah, my feelings got hurt, because I've been listening to NEW for  like 25 years, and then when Scott, you know, I was getting kind of, you know, so I stopped.  Boy, anyone else see that coming?  It's waiting.  My God.  Telegraphed that one, huh?  All right, well, to that lady, if she's still listening, there's a problem with our phones. 
[01:12:00]  Okay.  Thank you for that little AA meeting.  Yeah, I feel better.  You feel better now?  Good.  All right.  We'll all get by.  We have to play this.  You want to play it now instead of taking a break?  Yeah, go ahead.  Hopefully there's people still listening.  We're a talk station now, right?  Pretty much, according to the paper.  Just rumors.  People are quitting left and right around here today.  What's going on?  They're abandoning a ship.  Our buddy Ken Dashaw just quit, I heard.  Did he? 
[01:12:30]  Oops.  Ixnay.  Sorry.  You'll hear him on another station.  No one knows what we're saying.  No one's listening.  Okay, listen.  So Chelsea and Hillary are in Africa.  Yes.  They're away from the old man for two weeks.  As far away from Bill as possible.  And it's so obvious things are going on, because he's in a crisis right now with Kosovo.  And she should be there.  Yeah, of course.  You know, supporting him in a decision that might cost men their lives.  Mm-hmm. 
[01:13:00]  And she's out parading to Africa.  You know, it's obvious that there's nothing there.  Nothing.  Spending a couple weeks in Africa.  We got exclusive audio, Anthony, of Hillary and Chelsea's trip to Africa.  All right.  Would you like to hear the first clip here?  I would love to.  Okay, let's take a listen.  Mom, are these people cannibals?  Now, now, Chelsea.  Why would you say that?  Because the chief said he'd get anything to eat me.  Well, he sounds a lot like your father. 
[01:13:30]  Your mother, Hillary, is very respected here.  She has the one quality that is most coveted in our village.  What's that?  Wisdom, compassion.  No, a fat white ass.  Oh, wow.  Your African name, Chelsea, is Kiala Abelafu.  That's beautiful.  What does it mean?  Lanky, pale girl with face of a wombat.  Oh.  Hey, Mom, Mandingo wants me to go into the forest with him. 
[01:14:00]  I think he's going to let me have one of his pets.  Why do you think that, Chelsea?  Because he said he's going to give me his 12-inch Ubangi Black Snake.  Oh, it's beautiful out here, Mandingo.  By the way, what does your name mean?  It means man with three legs.  But you only have two legs.  Oh, really?  Chelsea, when we are through tonight, the whole village will call you Iwachalakanaya.  Me?  What does it mean? 
[01:14:30]  That means she who cannot sit for weeks.  Oh.  Now grab your ankles, Chelsea, and I will demonstrate what your father does to your countrymen.  Oh, that's good.  Oh, my God.  Oh, that's good.  Oh, that's good.  Oh, that's good.  Put it away.  Put it away.  Wow.  You've got to be kidding me.  Who knew that was going on?  They show those nice clips on the news with them smiling.  Well, I got part two of the bit.  Would you like to hear it? 
[01:15:00]  Yeah, we might as well be kicked out of the whole state.  Okay.  All right, so continuing with the saga, Hillary and Chelsea in Africa.  Okay.  Here we go.  Let's listen to another episode.  Part two?  Part two, yeah.  Oh, Mandingo.  It's so big.  I need two hands to hold it.  Oh, that's it, Chelsea.  Now wrap your lips around it.  What?  Like this?  Yes, that's it.  Now blow, Chelsea.  Blow. 
[01:15:30]  Nothing's coming out.  Oh, be patient, Chelsea, and blow harder.  Bullseye.  Thanks for showing me how to use your blow gun, Mandingo.  Anytime, Chelsea.  We best go back to the village and find your mother.  I wonder where she is.  Maybe she's in this hut.  Oh.  Mom, what are you doing with Mandingo's sister?  Oh, dear.  You said you were going on a safari. 
[01:16:00]  No, no.  I said before the day ends, I want to be deep in the bush.  Well, you do what you want.  I'm going to help Mandingo take care of a bad animal.  What are you talking about, Chelsea?  He wants me to spank his monkey.  We'll just be back in time for dinner.  Okay.  Well, what are we having?  I don't know about you, but I'll be having the African beaver.  Now, come on.  That isn't real audio from their trip to Africa, is it? 
[01:16:30]  I don't know.  Wow.  Our source is pretty reliable, Anthony.  That is just out of control.  Wow.  The Hillary and Chelsea audio, a big hit.  People seem to have liked that one.  Big, huge hit.  AnthonyPriceline.com.  Ah.  We love Priceline.  You want to save some money?  Huh?  You're going to be at a hotel anytime soon?  You're going to be out of town, maybe, or in town? 
[01:17:00]  Mm-hmm.  You need a hotel room?  You want to pay full price for that hotel room?  No.  No way.  So what do you do?  You call Priceline at 1-800-Priceline, or you get on the web at Priceline.com.  You name your price that you want to pay.  You feel is a reasonable price for the hotel room.  And Priceline gets you the price.  You get the hotel room.  Everyone's happy.  You've saved money.  Yeah, these guys have been on our show for a while now, and I just don't understand if  you're going away in the near future, need a hotel room or an airline ticket, why you 
[01:17:30]  wouldn't call to see what they could do for you.  It's free.  And the cool thing is, if you use their website, Priceline.com, you put down the price you  want to pay for a hotel room.  Within an hour, they're writing you back saying if your price was accepted or not.  Yeah.  And sometimes they'll bargain with you.  They'll say, well, look, I can't give you a hotel room for a dollar, but I'll give it  to you for $75.  It's usually $150.  Whatever.  You know, they'll make some deals with you and do the best they can. 
[01:18:00]  Significant savings.  Yes.  Not just like, hey, we'll save you a buck.  Right.  I can't get out of here.  Yeah, why bother at that point?  1027 WONW, the rock of New York.  Officially a threefer from the doors, Anthony.  Ho-ho.  Officially.  You caught us.  Blue Sunday, peace frog, and backdoor man.  Dude.  What?  Dow down 218.  Uh-huh.  Closed down.  Now, this amazes me about Wall Street, if I may quickly.  See, it says, mounting concerns that corporate earnings growth may have slowed substantially 
[01:18:30]  caused fear and selling on Wall Street.  So, all right, now it goes down.  But then in two weeks, it's like, the bright economic future caused a rally on Wall Street.  And then like two weeks later, you get, oh, it's looking grim again, folks.  We're all fickle.  Does it happen every two weeks?  Like, can't you get a big picture on the economy, look at it and go, it's good.  It will be good for a few months to come.  But there's a lot of people out there that day trade and they ride the highs and the lows 
[01:19:00]  and that's how they make their money.  Yeah, but the market takes the big dumps and big gains on rumor, at least, or news of the  economy.  Right.  Being good or bad or heading toward good or bad.  So, how could it change every other day?  These people are like, oh, mounting concerns, oh, low earnings, oh, boy, it's looking grim,  inflation, oh, boy, interest rate, and then two days later, it's the same things, but they're  good.  Everything's wrong.  And that's why everything went up.  Now, how did Infinity Broadcasting do? 
[01:19:30]  Because there's a lot of rumors about N.E.W.  Did that affect the stock price today, Anthony?  Last I checked, it was down.  It was down.  Okay.  Yes.  Yes.  Oh.  You think that's because of us?  I think it plummeted after the Hillary-Chelsea-Africa bit.  Man, that's a great bet.  I want to hear that again already.  Don't worry, no one in our show will play another four times this week.  Oh, yeah.  Like MTV over here. 
[01:20:00]  All right, listen, we've got to get a Dave Matthews ticket winner.  Yes.  Dave Matthews is playing a special show for us tomorrow with Ralph DeTorre at a secret  location.  Mm-hmm.  I know the place, too.  That would really piss off a lot of people, though.  No.  Uh-oh.  Thanks, no.  Ooh.  What the?  Wait, why is the boss in here?  Hi, boss.  Oh, my God.  Bye.  Bye, people.  Bye.  He doesn't have a baseball bat, so I think we're okay.  He was on earlier.  Mr. Herman, how are you? 
[01:20:30]  Hey, guys.  We like to call him the big boss man.  Good.  Did he hear all that?  No, he walks in, I get scared and stuff.  Like, he's going to, you know, the Opian Anthony program will no longer be heard in  this time slot.  I am armed with cassettes and phone messages.  What could I, uh...  Oh, really?  Cassettes of what?  Our show?  That people mail you and...  As a matter of fact, yes.  ...point out little things that we've done and...  You've got to talk into the...  Yeah, there we go.  Hi.  What's the latest complaint?  We just got through a nasty complaint and we're safe, right? 
[01:21:00]  I hope so.  We won't say which one.  Yes.  We made it through that one?  Mm-hmm.  Unscathed?  Mm-hmm.  Okay.  What's the latest one?  Come on!  The latest one is we have to make sure that we're doing the Stacker commercials.  Yeah, right.  Okay?  That we mention their slogan.  Yeah.  Which is the world's strongest fat burner.  Right.  And that we just treat the client very nicely.  Oh, yeah.  We love Stacker.  We have been.  Opie's been taking Stacker, too. 
[01:21:30]  Look at him.  And it has helped me.  He's a lean, mean, fighting machine.  That's the first thing that comes to mind when I think of it.  Mm-hmm.  They don't like the drug references that we've made in the past.  Okay.  Correct.  Oh, they were done in jest.  No, no, no.  I know that.  I know that.  But, you know.  It's called kidding.  I know.  But you know what?  These people are buying time.  I mean...  Okay.  All right.  The comedy portion is when people are not paying for it.  Okay?  I see.  We have the comedy portion.  You pay for the comedy portion. 
[01:22:00]  Exactly.  Exactly.  Okay.  So what's the tape?  Yeah.  Is the tape...  That looks like a tape of our show.  Saying something bad?  No.  As a matter of fact, it's fine.  Oh, okay.  But, you know...  Did you hear our last bit?  There are times that I can't be at the radio.  You know?  And, like, I have things taped.  Then I listen to it when I go home.  So I could just...  Was the tape rolling on the Chelsea Hillary in Africa bit we just played?  No.  Oh, good.  We didn't play it.  We don't even have one.  You may be getting some calls on that tomorrow.  Well, no.  It's that good.  It's that double entendre humor that you told us to work on. 
[01:22:30]  It's a cute little bit.  This guy, Mandingo, teaches her how to use a blowgun.  Maybe we want to move the triple entendre.  Triple entendre with our bits.  Triple entendre.  That way no one understands.  Right.  All right.  So you didn't hear that bit.  That's good.  All right.  Good.  You'll have a happy drive home then.  For once.  Any other news there?  No.  Reporters calling about the story in the Daily News?  Yeah, they are.  And you know what?  It's... 
[01:23:00]  Yeah.  Rumors are rumors.  I mean, we talked about this earlier.  Who starts rumors?  Other stations.  Exactly.  Other stations, boss.  Other stations.  Right?  I mean, all radio stations are always looking for, you know, things they should be doing  to get more listeners, to get more listening.  True.  You know?  Oh, okay.  I mean, but, you know, Jesus.  I mean, I get nervous when I think, you know, the only thing you really know about the newspaper  is like your business.  Right.  And then when you know how poorly things are written about your business, doesn't it get 
[01:23:30]  you to worry about it?  I know.  It's like when you're reading about the war in Yugoslavia, when they could possibly be  right about that.  I know.  It's halfway around the world.  And we don't know from a hole in the wall what the actual facts are.  So, yeah.  When they write stuff about you, you're like, wait a minute.  That's not true.  But no one's going to believe me.  Yeah.  So.  But we're allowed to talk more, right?  Sure.  Absolutely.  Yeah.  Talk more.  And play in that great rock.  See?  We played six songs today.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  So far.  See, that's where rumors come from.  That's how that crap gets in the paper. 
[01:24:00]  Well, who wants to hear a Styx twofer?  Jesus.  We got a Chelsea and Hillary bit to get to.  There you go again.  Now, see, now you're.  Now the music department's going to get all upset.  I'll get them.  I'll get them, boss.  Opie, that's not productive.  It does you or the station no good to downplay the music.  Right.  What you do is good.  But the music also helps to.  Could you shut me up?  Could you throw something at my head?  Very good, Anthony.  That would fall into the idle bitching.  No, I think that's the fake remorse.  Can we play a couple songs that we dig tomorrow? 
[01:24:30]  I mean, really dig.  I want to play like Godsmack.  Godsmack's good.  I want to play Rob Zombie.  There's no one.  Living Dead Girl.  God, that song rocks.  Would that make you happy?  Yeah.  Tomorrow, can we play a couple of our faves?  Just as a goof?  Sure.  Is Gary still gone?  Gary will be back tomorrow.  Damn.  I want to play whatever by Godsmack.  Is the language okay?  Am I approving something?  We'll get the radio edit.  No, the Godsmack whatever is one of the hottest songs in the country right now. 
[01:25:00]  Okay.  You'll get the radio edit, though.  Sure show.  We can find that.  And then Anthony wants to play a couple.  Living Dead Girl, yeah.  Living Dead Girl would be cool.  I mean, I like the doors and stuff.  Okay, now we've just gone from, can I play one, to I want to play a few, and Anthony wants  to play a couple.  Come on.  Next thing you know, we have anarchy and another article in the paper.  I'm going to play a few, and I'm going to play a few, and I'm going to play a few, and I'm going to play a few, and I'm going to play a few, and I'm going to play a few, and I'm going to play a few, and I'm going to play a few, and I'm going to play a few, and I'm going to play a few, and I'm going to play a few, and I'm going to play a few, and I'm going to play a few, and I'm going to play a few, and I'm going to play a few, and I'm going to play a few, and I'm going to play a few, and I'm going to play a few, and I'm going to play a few, and I'm going to play a few, and I'm going to play a few, and I'm going to play a few, and I'm going to play a few, and I'm going to play a few, and I'm going to play </pre>
