<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opens with chaotic, vulgar banter, heavy on profanity and sexually explicit language,  characterized by exaggerated descriptions of the show's own outrageousness and unpredictability.  A discussion ensues about a publicity photo where Courtney Love allegedly touched Opie's nipples, leading to Opie detailing his aversion to nipple stimulation, contrasting it with other sexual preferences, and sharing anecdotes about massage therapists. This segues into a conversation about desensitization to sexual stimulation.

Anthony then laments his severely leaky pool, recounting numerous failed attempts by repairmen to find the source of the water loss.  Listener calls offer a mix of practical advice and absurd solutions, adding to the comedic chaos. The hosts also detail a bet concerning Roland's extreme sleepiness during a screening of Seth Rogen's "This Is the End," describing his slumber in the movie theater.

The hosts rave about "This Is the End," though pre-release restrictions limit plot details. They mention a potential appearance by Kevin Pollak and a past gift-giving incident involving him. The conversation then shifts to the Toronto mayor's crack cocaine scandal and his evasive press conference, with the hosts speculating on his guilt and the potential for incriminating video evidence.  The segment concludes with a search for a video clip of a child contestant having a meltdown during a spelling bee.

The show continues with discussion of the absurdity of the Animal Planet mermaid documentary and the viral Prancercise video, featuring Joanne Rohr, described as an "old, dumb fat cunt" with a prominent camel toe. Opie expresses regret over a pre-taped appearance on Kamau Bell's show, fearing editing issues. He also mentions positive feedback from Michelle Beadle and promotes the podcast, boasting high download numbers due partly to automated subscriptions, and referencing past guests Jeffrey Tambor, Mick Foley, and Annie Letterman.

The hosts recount Roland falling asleep sideways in the theater during "This Is the End," lamenting missed photo opportunities.  They discuss the cronut craze and Justin Bieber's perceived inability to handle attractive women.  The conversation returns to Prancercise, culminating in a live interview with Joanne Rohr, who explains her inspiration.  A fan calls in, and the segment concludes with further discussion of Prancercise, cronuts, and a news story about a baby found in a Chinese sewer pipe.

Comedian Kevin Pollak calls in from Philadelphia, requesting recommendations.  The hosts jokingly suggest West Philly (referencing Will Smith), the Liberty Bell, and the Mutter Museum, described as a "fucked up museum." Pollak also discusses "This Is the End" and Seth Rogen's promise of a gift to the show, mirroring a previous gift from Pollak himself. The hosts' conversation meanders to preferred ammunition types, a supposed exchange program between France and Philadelphia involving "small somewhat talented Jews," and Opie's Twitter frustrations.

The show heavily features "Prancercise," mocking its presentation. This leads to discussion of Justin Bieber's car troubles and his attempts at a "bad boy" image, inspiring a comedic bit about a "Chippithizing" video.  The "Boston Strong" concert is mentioned (featuring Steven Tyler, James Taylor, and others), before returning to "Prancercise" and the Today Show audience's apparent lack of enthusiasm.  The hosts joke about recycled signage at the Today Show and continue mocking the "Boston Strong" and later boy band (New Kids on the Block, 98 Degrees, and Boys II Men) performers. The segment ends with continued discussion of the concerts, other media appearances, and personal banter, including numerous crude jokes, sexually explicit references, and extensive vulgar language. Nicole, a staff member, is briefly present in studio.

A later segment features sexually suggestive banter with Nicole (a female guest) about her breasts and feet.  The conversation shifts to a news story about a Maryland teacher charged with sexual acts involving a dog, prompting sexually explicit and offensive jokes.  A promotional segment for "American War Stories" featuring Robert Kelly is played, followed by a lengthy discussion of Anthony's leaky pool.  Jim Norton's Vine video, "I'm Chippisizing," is discussed, leading to a conversation about sexually explicit Vine videos described with graphic language.  The show criticizes the Jeff Probst Show, particularly a segment deemed condescending.  A bizarre, poorly received on-air audition for Nicole for "Grimm" takes place, facilitated by a casting director and actor Reggie Lee.  The episode concludes with plugs for upcoming events and mentions of Kevin Pollak and cronuts.

The final segment introduces two new interns, Tyler and Sydney. Tyler discusses his surprisingly cheap Village dorm room, leading to a discussion about NYC living costs and speculation about a potential intern prank. The conversation shifts to the show's culture and characters, mentioning past intern Alan and anecdotes about Troy.  Numerous listener calls, many centered on the inside joke “slabo,”  are included. Tyler's background and aspirations are explored, and Sydney is introduced, discussing her radio experience and brother's influence on her application.  They contrast the O&A atmosphere with previous work experiences. The hosts and interns discuss SiriusXM personalities, and listener calls comment on the interns' appearances. A Dollarshaveclub.com advertisement and a final mention of Sam Roberts' upcoming show conclude the broadcast.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  Welcome to the Arby and Earth show.  What before has one radio show been so extreme?  Oh my god!  Oh my god!  So vulgar.  Fuck you, I'm not a pussy!  I was accustomed to getting blown and having my ass eaten.  This is insane. I mean, I mean, this is insane.  So flasherent. 
[00:00:30]  Why do we even try?  Let's just fart into the mics and call it a day.  This is the funniest shit ever.  It's a weird show.  That's what's real.  That's the sex.  Tune in with no expectations.  It's simply the greatest show in the history of broadcasting.  Here we go.  The Arby and Anthony show.  Another four hours of love.  You guys having a good time or what?  Yeah!  Yeah! 
[00:01:00]  Check!  Yeah!  Yeah!  Check it!  I'm up early in the morning.  Yawning.  With Opie Anthony.  Yeah!  Jimmy Tranny pointing.  Opie like brother man.  Ant wants to join the clan.  Jimmy on the other hand.  He working all the hands.  Turn my headphones up.  There are horrible people.  What to say in this show?  I'll catch you with you with beans.  And I want you to know.  Unacceptable to my scene.  But I'll give it a go.  50 cent Larry King. 
[00:01:30]  Opie and Anthony show.  Go.  Go.  I know you're feeling the flow.  But Opie's mother hunking.  Jimmy's trying to get blown.  They would come to play around.  And we're still in the show.  I know you never heard nothing like this before.  How important is the board?  Board you'll never be.  And don't worry about getting shot when you're with Anthony.  Oh yeah.  On the edge of your hair.  Cause you really want to hear Opie, Anthony and Jimmy.  Just keep it right here.  It's the Opie and Anthony show.  Yeah.  Opie and Anthony show.  Check out.  It's the Opie and Anthony show. 
[00:02:00]  It's the Opie and Anthony show.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  50.  Yeah.  Now my type is up in this pit.  It's the Opie and Anthony show.  Booga booga.  Booga booga.  Enough of this platter.  Let's get this show on the road.  Let's get this show on the road.  I can't believe that Larry King, 50 Cent and Mike Tyson sang a little ditty for us.  Huge.  A little ditty.  Huge.  A little nugget.  Oh God. 
[00:02:30]  You know, I had gone a few hours last night and this morning without thinking of nugget.  Now I gotta think about a nugget.  A little nugget.  I don't know how we're gonna top yesterday's show, but I guess it's our jobs to try, huh?  Well, just the fact that it's Friday helps.  Yes, it does.  We're in that, you know, ready for the weekend thing.  Yeah.  We're working for the weekend.  Well, we sure are.  You're right, aren't we?  We're working for the weekend.  Yeah.  Yeah.  He gave it a thumbs up. 
[00:03:00]  Ah, yeah, it is.  I like to sing that.  Whoa.  It's this version.  Oh, it's Jimmy's version.  I like Jimmy's version.  All right.  Everyone's watching to see what he will do.  Everyone's looking at you.  Oh, everyone's wondering where you come out tonight. 
[00:03:30]  Everyone's trying to get it right.  Oh, everyone's working for the weekend.  Everyone's working on the weekend.  What?  We're working for it on it, Jimmy.  Everybody's working for the weekend.  The weekend.  Everybody's working for the weekend. 
[00:04:00]  It's a great version.  You want a piece of my heart?  I love that version.  I would go see you in concert.  Oh, hell yeah.  Actually, an hour and a half of that.  Thank you.  I want to talk about nipples being tweaked because, I don't know, I don't really understand  it.  I know Jimmy loves it.  I'm not from that camp either.  Courtney Love tweaked our nipples in a publicity photo yesterday, and I hate it.  I got to be honest.  I don't like it. 
[00:04:30]  I moved.  Yeah.  I moved, so she was really kind of tweaking my peck.  Oh, yeah.  She was really fucking going at it.  She missed my nipples completely.  Oh, she did?  Because I moved.  I didn't want a tweak.  I hate a nipple tweak.  I hate it.  I don't like it.  It hurts.  It's annoying.  No, not hard.  Not hard.  I like it as a goof.  I like that picture because it was just silly and stupid, but as far as a turn-on, man,  I don't, I don't, I don't, I don't like my nipples.  No.  Oh, no.  You're lucky. 
[00:05:00]  It's a distraction.  Why?  I don't even get it.  Look.  And I can make them hard, but it doesn't mean like I'm fucking excited.  No.  I don't know what happened along the way where that became a thing.  I didn't like that to my mid-20s.  I think I just desensitized and ruined everything else.  It was like just healthy real estate.  Seems to be the consensus.  So, but now it's like, it just, I love it.  You love it.  It's distracting though because I feel like I can't even be a good partner in bed because  I'm always worried about my own nipples.  But my wiring is, it's not connected.  Right. 
[00:05:30]  Yeah.  It's not.  I can rub them until they get a little fucking hard, but it doesn't mean anything.  It's like, it's not connected to my penis or my brain.  No.  Right?  The wiring's just not there.  It's not there.  It's just, and it looks silly.  It does.  Believe me.  You think, you know how many times I've looked down at my dumb praying mantis hands as I  heetle the night away?  Heetle the night away.  Heetle.  Heetle.  We're going to heetle.  Heetle the night away. 
[00:06:00]  Heetle.  We're going to heetle.  We're going to heetle.  We're going to heetle the night away.  I just can't stop.  No, I'm not there with that either.  This guy's into it, though, huh?  I don't know why it happened to me.  How many guys are into it?  Is it a small percentage?  I don't even know.  I don't know.  I've asked massage therapists because sometimes I'm like, you know, I'll just talk.  Then they do my chest sometimes.  But they're very professional.  They'll avoid your nips.  Once in a while, they'll go over it.  They won't hit them on purpose like sexy. 
[00:06:30]  But even that feels kind of good.  Yeah.  But I hate when they just do like a real peck rub with their thumbs.  Peck rub, peck rub.  How professional do you have to be?  We get it.  You're not a hooker.  They really got to show that they're not fucking hookers and they're professional masseuses.  They fucking treat your nipple like it's a plague.  Oh, Jesus.  Why don't you just fucking scrape a nail over that for all time's sake?  Nothing, huh?  Yeah, give a little flickeroo.  No one's looking.  You know, if they're not doing that, they're not going anywhere near your dick.  Why would they?  The worst is when they're massaging your stomach and they hit it through the towel. 
[00:07:00]  Right.  And it feels like they did it on purpose, but you know they didn't.  Oh, boy.  You must be tuned in to every single move that they do.  If it's a signal, if it's a brush, if it's accidental, it's on purpose.  Look at his face.  It's a living hell.  Look at his face.  I knew he was going to say that.  Because you're dissecting every fucking brush.  Was that one?  Was that it?  Right.  Even though it was a little slip.  Then she moved away.  She would have gone close.  But maybe she wants me to think.  Is that just going through your head the whole time? 
[00:07:30]  Yes.  Well, I'm babysitting.  No, it does.  It's hard.  I get the legit massage.  And I notice they're going a little lower these days.  Yeah.  Yeah.  They're going a little lower into the buttocks area.  I like that.  There used to be where, man, you were covered up right to your crack.  And I don't know.  The times, they are a changing.  Do you make sure you're well showered beforehand?  Yeah.  I don't want to go in and swamp ass or anything like that.  You don't want to go with a cranky palm when she leaves. 
[00:08:00]  Oh, God.  But I guess maybe it's more acceptable or something.  I don't know.  Because you get a good butt rub sometimes.  Do you know?  And I know they're not trying to, you know.  To be dirty.  No.  You just know.  I have a sore on my...  It's on my tailbone.  I have a sore on my tailbone.  It's on my tailbone.  And it's from...  I've had it once before.  It's from doing certain mat exercises like the abs where you're rubbing on the abs and  the tailbone is just digging into the fucking...  Oh, be careful with that shit.  It's a small scab.  And it's hard that I flew cross country and flew back. 
[00:08:30]  And it's like you're sitting on that area.  So it's like...  Now I'm just putting Neosporin on it.  It's fine.  But I took a picture of it.  I'll show you.  Oh, no.  But it's hard during a massage because I have to avoid the tailbone.  Dude, hold on.  But you've got to make sure it's not Mercer.  Oh.  Rogan...  I don't know if Rogan officially had Mercer.  But Rogan gets some shit from the mat sometimes.  No, no.  It's through clothes.  It's not bare mat.  Because you could get some shit from gym mats.  Yeah, yeah.  This is through clothes.  Yeah, you know what?  I thought of that too.  I'm like...  I was just making sure you're all right. 
[00:09:00]  I thought, is this that flesh-eating disease?  I did think that.  Mercer was a motherfucker.  But I've been putting...  I sent a picture to Dr. Thieb.  I'm not sure.  Dr. Thieb.  It looks bad.  Let me see.  It's just like a little red sore.  Oh, God.  That's your butt crack too?  No, no, no.  It's above the butt crack.  You can't see the butt crack.  But it's the top of your butt crack.  Yeah.  I can see butt crack in that kind of...  No, I absolutely can see butt crack.  What is that white line then?  Oh, maybe...  That's the top of the crack, but that's not where the asshole is.  Right.  I know. 
[00:09:30]  I know.  I just don't know the whole picture of the asshole.  Yeah, yeah.  And...  But I mean, it feels better instead of putting Neosporin on it.  And it happened once before, and it was not a bare rub.  It's...  I have my fucking shirt on, and it was literally from just rubbing against the chafing when  I do my ab exercise.  You need to put something down.  Like, if I'm doing sit-ups, let's say, I will put a towel down so the tailbone just  doesn't get crunched up so much.  You know how, like, that does...  It'll just grind on your fucking...  That little thin skin there. 
[00:10:00]  I don't know.  Yeah.  No, it doesn't usually.  Oh, I've had it once before.  I have enough buffer area of, like, my sweats are nice and cushy.  Buffers.  Yeah.  Buffers.  Yeah.  Just go and do your abs.  Jesus.  Do your crunches.  Yeah.  You know.  Corny Love, though, was terrific yesterday.  Oh, wonderful.  I think we made a new friend.  You think?  Yeah.  You kind of feel it every once in a while.  She'll be back.  She had a great time.  She was retweeting all our shit yesterday.  She did.  She did have a good time.  She hung out a few minutes after the show, which is always a sign that she enjoyed herself. 
[00:10:30]  The big hugs.  Huge hugs.  And then she basically said, I hope you'll have me back.  I'm like, you're Corny Love.  Of course we'll have you back.  Wow.  And we didn't think it was going to go well.  Well, at first, you know.  I try to have an open mind now.  Usually when some shit goes down before the interview, I'm like, all right, fuck this.  I'm blowing this up soon.  Instantly.  Right.  But I said...  Because Jimmy was basically going, no, man, I think this is going to be all right.  Yeah.  He talked me down.  Florentine was like completely saying, no, it's going to be good. 
[00:11:00]  Right.  So I'm like, you know what?  I love it.  Just have an open mind.  Thank God.  Because she was awesome.  Yeah.  I loved her.  Sometimes the ones that look like they're such a disaster, you know, are going to be okay  because they look like they're so ready to be.  It was almost like it couldn't be this perfect where it was going to be so awful.  Right.  Right.  And sometimes the ones that we think are going to be amazing turn out to be fucked up.  Ah, that was terrible and disappointing.  Like, you know.  Yeah.  She was so open.  She talked about everything.  Yeah.  I loved her.  I think we figured out she's going to be on The X Factor.  She didn't say that. 
[00:11:30]  She didn't say it.  She didn't say that.  She said some show was wooing her, I guess.  One of those types of, you know, talent.  Merkin Idol or X Factor, it seems like.  She'd be perfect for those shows.  She didn't deny it.  No.  When we said Dance with the Stars, she denied it.  Yeah.  She denied those, a couple of shows like that.  Right.  The Voice, she denied that.  Right.  So, I don't know.  Whatever.  Good for her.  Wow.  But the tweaking of the nipples picture is, I'm sure it's on our Facebook and all that. 
[00:12:00]  I liked her doing that.  You loved it.  Me and Jimmy and Ann were talking.  Your eyes just rolled back.  I was squirming to get her hand away from my nipple.  No, I mean when she did it to him.  Oh, yeah.  And she looked like she was really squeezing at one point.  And Jim was just there with a big smile on his face.  I don't like them painful.  Like a little pressure I can take.  But I can't take like real nipple torture.  I don't want it touched.  I don't know.  Nipple torture is a real fetish for guys.  Like torture.  Like alligator clamps and shit.  Yeah.  I don't get that.  No, no.  I like light brushing.  Yeah, I just don't get it. 
[00:12:30]  I understand guys are into it, but.  Yeah.  You like when they use their mouths?  Oh, my God.  Look at Jimmy.  More.  It just came.  Than I like most things.  Oh, man.  Yeah, that's a home run.  All right, how about this?  No, it's too ticklish.  More than going on Jay Leno?  Yeah.  I think Jay would understand.  It's too ticklish at that point.  It's too distracting.  When a girl starts venturing south of the neckline like that, I like that route to be the green 
[00:13:00]  one on the nav system.  Yeah.  Where it's like, yes, the most direct, quickest way to the penis.  No detours over the nipples or anything.  Let's just keep this where we know I want you to be.  I always need something else, though.  Like the jerking off does it for me.  My dick being sucked.  Yeah.  What do you use this for?  Jacking off?  Jacking off.  I'm Warren Jerome.  I have good ass cheeks.  But I used to take my left thumb and put it under my balls when I jerked off and put  pressure there.  Hey, wait, wait.  Your left thumb?  Like this?  Yeah, like pressuring my fist against my balls. 
[00:13:30]  Not hard.  You were telling your balls, hey!  Yeah.  But I like that pressure.  I don't like that anymore.  I like the nip.  I always like something else.  It's like I've got to be distracted.  I don't know why.  You change it up a lot?  I haven't in years, but I mean, that's...  I'm just desensitized, man.  Is that what it is?  You ever see Carnal Knowledge?  I don't remember it.  That movie.  Liz Taylor, was it?  No.  Carnal Knowledge was Jack Nicholson.  Yes.  And fucking Art Garfunkel.  Who was the woman in that film?  And Anne Margaret.  Oh, Anne Margaret.  Right, okay.  And what happened was Jack Nicholson is so desensitized to sex that he needs like this 
[00:14:00]  weird kind of fucking, you know, something odd.  And it just, it winds up ruining any chance for him to have like a normal kind of relationship.  Yeah.  I think that's what it was about.  I saw it years ago.  It's like Blue Velvet's like that, too.  Like, he's so fucked up.  He has to...  It needed the money!  He has to have dirty, kinky, and you get to this place where you need stuff like that,  and it's just, it's uncomfortable. 
[00:14:30]  Well, there you go.  Courtney, yeah, I love you.  Thank you for doing our show yesterday.  It was terrific.  Yeah.  I saw Seth Rogen's latest movie last night.  When does that come out?  Another week or two?  We were lucky to go to a preview, thanks to Roland.  And I was too scared to take my phone out, because they were really marching up and down  the aisles.  Yeah.  They get security for these screenings, because they're trying to make sure no one bootlegs  They didn't confiscate your phones?  No.  But Roland, you know how I lost a bet when he stayed awake for what, what was it? 
[00:15:00]  Star Trek.  Star Trek, right?  I lost $100.  Yeah, because he always falls asleep in those screeners.  But he decided, oh, fuck it, if I'm going to get $100, I'm going to, what did he say?  Eat popcorn, because it gets acid reflux going.  Yeah.  And then he drank a lot of coffee, so he stayed awake and won the bet.  Uh-huh.  Dude, I've been to a lot of movies with Roland over the last few years.  I've never seen anyone sleep like he did yesterday in this movie.  Oh, really?  He had the aisle seat.  I was right next to him. 
[00:15:30]  He was like a bent tree after a storm.  Half his body was out of the seat, and he's a big guy, sleeping sideways in the aisle, in midair.  Was he snoring?  Fuck yeah, he was snoring.  How embarrassing.  And I picked up my phone a couple times.  I was a pussy.  I couldn't get the picture.  Oh, you should have.  Because I needed the flash.  I needed the flash, because it was a little dark.  This movie was a little dark at times.  And I couldn't get the picture.  He was sideways. 
[00:16:00]  Oh, man.  I've never seen this before.  I don't even know how he was still anchored.  Yeah.  Without falling into the aisle.  Out cold for most of the movie.  And then, of course, we leave the theater, and he's telling me how great the movie is.  I'm like...  Oh, that was so good.  I'm like, I had my eyes open the entire time, and it was...  Sir Rogen.  Sir Rogen.  This Seth Rogen movie is going to do very, very well, man.  Very well.  Funny movie?  It was really funny.  Whole bunch of guys, and they play themselves, in quotes. 
[00:16:30]  Yeah.  I guess what people think they are.  Right.  The impression people have of who they are, yeah.  And then Seth Rogen, and that guy, his name's Jay.  He's been in a bunch of those movies, too.  I always forget his last name, though.  He flies in L.A. to hang out with Seth Rogen, and then they go to James Franco's house for  this massive party where a whole bunch of fucking celebrities are there, including Rihanna,  fucking Kevin Hart, Aziz, Michael Cera, a million fucking people. 
[00:17:00]  And then, you know...  Oh, yeah, that guy.  Jay Barucci.  He's been in a whole bunch of those movies, right?  Which ones were he in, Sam?  Was he in?  Excuse me.  Well, he did Undeclared.  He was the star of that Apatow series.  Right.  And then he was in that movie where he played the awkward dude on the airplane that met  the stewardess, and they fell in love.  What the fuck are you talking about?  He pops up.  He was in... 
[00:17:30]  He pops in a bunch of movies.  He was in Knocked Up.  He was, right?  Okay.  Yeah, he was one of the roommates in Knocked Up.  Right, right.  But Undeclared.  There's quite a pompadour there.  Yeah, he's got a big part in this movie.  And then James Franco's playing himself, which is, you know, what we think he is.  Uh-huh.  Just a partier.  And, dude, the movie was fucking hilarious.  Fucking...  I don't...  It's hard to talk about these movies, because you don't want to give away too much.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  So it's kind of...  It kind of sucks, because they want you to see the movie, because Seth Rogen's coming  in here.  The old days, we would just talk about the movie and say, fuck it. 
[00:18:00]  Uh-huh.  But we're just not in that world anymore, and it was good.  I don't know what I'm allowed to say.  Funny fucking movie.  Because I don't want to fuck it up for people, because there's a lot of nice surprises in it.  I'll tell you one thing, though.  Danny McBride is a fucking pimp.  Yeah.  He almost steals the fucking movie.  He's that damn good in this.  Yeah, he's a funny guy.  Danny McBride is the real fucking deal.  Well, when he shows up, I mean, it's his movie for a big, big stretch. 
[00:18:30]  A real big stretch.  What is it called?  This is the end?  Uh-huh.  And Seth Rogen directed it and wrote it.  Ooh.  Yeah, and he's coming in.  Jonah Hill.  A talented man.  Craig Robinson was really good in this movie.  Those were the main guys, basically.  You got the J guy we talked about, Craig Robinson, Seth Rogen, Danny McBride, Jonah Hill, and  James Franco.  All fucking hilarious.  All taking their turns being hilarious.  Michael Cera, not in the movie a lot, but fucking hilarious.  Yeah.  Beyond hilarious. 
[00:19:00]  I gotta see this now.  How did he feel in his own skin?  Well, that's...  He was hilarious.  See, I don't want to give anything away.  We make fun of the fact that he plays the same type of role every time.  Well, I think he's aware of that.  I'll say that much.  I'm sure he'd be aware of it.  He's extremely aware that people think he's just a quirky...  Little typecasting going on.  Yeah.  Yeah.  ...uncomfortable kid in every movie he plays, so...  Perhaps he, you know, ventures away from that a bit.  A bit? 
[00:19:30]  A bit?  Yeah.  So...  Whoa.  The plane in the middle of an apartment building.  All right.  And then the monsters are good.  It turns into a disaster flick.  Yeah.  And...  End of the world type movie, so...  Those are kind of big right now.  Really?  End of the world movie.  Yeah.  There's a few little end of the world movie things that are out there.  The Will Smith one?  Will Smith.  Yeah.  Night Shyamalan, whatever it is, direct that.  Did he really?  Yeah.  Of course.  He's fucking terrible.  Awful.  Yeah. 
[00:20:00]  Well, be careful, because Roland thinks that Will Smith's calling our show next week.  Oh, stop it.  Who even wants him on the phone?  Like, why don't you just come in?  Yeah, I don't care.  You got a fucking movie with...  It's a summer bomb.  It was supposed to be a big fucking deal.  So, he might just call...  World War Z is another one.  Yeah.  It's coming out.  Big kind of apocalyptic zombie-ish thing.  Mm-hmm.  Mm-hmm.  I can't wait to talk about This Is The End with, you know, you guys when you see it.  Mm-hmm.  And the listeners. 
[00:20:30]  You got to give it a week or two after it's out.  Because there's some great shit in this movie.  Fucking just hilarious.  Hilarious.  The Harry Potter chick's in it.  Oh.  She's fucking terrific.  She's sexy.  Yeah, she's really sexy.  She is.  Really sexy.  Who'd have thunk it?  So, there's a twist with Jonah Hill.  It's just...  I want to talk about this fucking movie!  They make you see it, but then you can't talk about it.  No.  When is Seth in?  Uh, soon.  I tweeted him.  I was so excited.  He tweeted me back saying... 
[00:21:00]  He tweeted a fuckload of people that saw it and were, like, saying it was great.  Yeah.  A lot of people saying it's great?  Yeah.  Oh, good.  Yeah, he tweeted me back.  He goes, I'm supposed to see you guys soon, and I guess I gotta bring a present like Kevin  Pollack.  Oh, shit.  The word is out.  What the fuck?  The word is out.  Opie and Anthony need gifts.  By the way, Opie and Anthony?  Why not?  I haven't seen shit.  Well, that's why I'm adding you to the list.  I haven't seen shit.  I could have said Opie needs gifts, but I just added you. 
[00:21:30]  I'm taking care of you.  It's amazing.  I'm taking care of you.  Anthony, you mean Kevin Pollack didn't send you a gift?  You know what?  No.  You're not on Kevin Pollack's good side right now, man.  And guess what?  Oh.  Now he's obligated to send Anthony a gift because of this guy, I guess.  That's uncomfortable.  Sorry, buddy.  You can talk to him about it.  I think he might call today.  Yeah?  Yeah, because we were going back and forth a little bit as well yesterday.  He's playing the Helium Comedy Club down there in Philly.  Oh.  I think it's completely sold out, but he's down there this weekend. 
[00:22:00]  Kevin?  Yeah.  And he was going to blow off all this Philly press just to come up and see us.  Oh, man.  And I had to calm him down.  I'm like, we would love that, but I don't want to fucking start any trouble for him down  the road.  So I think he might just call and say hi today.  We'll see.  So this is the end.  I think our audience will certainly love this movie.  Well, you get a good comedy at the beginning of the summer, it can fucking just kill.  It can own the fucking theaters.  Oh, I can tell you this much. 
[00:22:30]  They make fun of each other's movies that they've all done.  Oh, really?  Oh, God.  Yeah.  It's kind of funny when they do that.  They just beat the shit out of each other.  It's really funny.  People love that fourth wall coming down a bit.  Yeah.  They do like that.  James Franco collects all his props from all his movies.  Oh, man.  It was well written.  Fuck, I want to talk about this.  What can I do?  Eh, got to wait.  My hands are tied behind my back.  My hands are tied.  A lot of big laughs, though. 
[00:23:00]  Sold out.  Sold out.  Well, I guess everyone got free tickets.  Yeah.  I'm in a tough spot.  Fuck.  Well, I was so excited to come in here and talk about it, but then I realized that I really  can't.  No.  You'll ruin it for everyone.  Hmm.  I can't do that.  You do anything fun yesterday?  Yesterday?  I'm still waiting for my fucking, you know, I'm having these intermittent times where  I could use my pool and then the guys come in to work on it and try to figure it out 
[00:23:30]  still, that there's still massive amounts of water just disappearing.  Still?  From my pool.  Yes.  I thought they figured it out.  No.  So it's got to be the bottom drain.  That's what I'm saying.  It has to be at this point.  I'm ready to just, I'm ready to just lay this out here.  If that leak is not identified and remedied by today.  Today.  Today.  Wow.  I am putting it out there to all people that know how to work pool. 
[00:24:00]  Right.  You solve the problem, you get invited to one summer party.  There.  Whoa.  Whoa.  So these guys got to fucking fix my fucking pool.  We don't even get invited to the parties.  I've had it.  Man, I got to fucking figure out how to fix pools.  Yeah.  And this is the problem caused by modern comfort pools.  Oh, wow.  Out there on Long Island.  That cock.  Has he blown you off?  Of course.  I haven't seen or heard from that guy in forever.  But I heard from the other pool guy, because all these pool guys kind of meet up at these 
[00:24:30]  pool places.  They know each other.  And they knew each other.  And the modern comfort pool guy found out that I said on the air I was trashing him.  Right.  And he was very angry about it.  Good.  He's angry.  Good.  You fucked up my whole fucking pool, you cock.  Yeah.  Why are you angry?  You got the shitty pool.  Exactly.  How is that guy angry?  Fuck modern comfort pools.  Fuck him in his ass.  Bastard.  So now I gotta sit there, and I'm waiting. 
[00:25:00]  And now these guys...  Didn't they reduce all sorts of shit for you?  Yeah, they redid all the gunite in the pool.  And that didn't solve the problem?  No.  It's a fucking, some type of pipe problem, I gotta say.  But they pressure tested all the pipes, and apparently there's no leak.  Well, apparently there is.  So I'm just like, here's my suggestion.  You plug up all the fucking holes, and then you pull one.  And then you wait.  If it doesn't leak, you put the plug back in, you pull another fucking plug. 
[00:25:30]  And you see.  How much water are you losing a day?  A day.  Let's see.  It's gotta be, from a 24 hour period, two inches of water.  Throughout the whole pool.  Yes, it is a lot.  That's a lot.  Where the fuck is all that water going?  Where the fuck is it going?  And everyone speculates.  And then they mark the side of the pool with a piece of tape.  And then they leave.  Maybe you're...  And then they turn the pump on.  But they only have a pump through the skimmers.  And then this. 
[00:26:00]  And then they come back.  And they move the tape.  And they did...  I can't have this!  It's summer!  Maybe your dinosaur's thirsty.  That's what people have said.  Oh, they have said that?  I thought I was original.  Every possible combination of things.  There's not an original thought left out there, is there?  It's like a dinosaur comes to life at night and drinks the pool water.  It would be funny if there's just a big fat neighbor that would come in and does a cannonball every day and then leaves.  And leave.  They've speculated that the modern comfort guy pumps the water out at night.  Because he's, you know, mad that I've said that he sucks.  It is... 
[00:26:30]  I don't know.  No water shows up anywhere else.  It doesn't end up in my basement.  There's no sinkhole.  There's no soggy spots anywhere.  So weird.  It's just massive amounts of water disappearing for years now, by the way.  This is going on probably five years.  It's got to be your bottom thing.  It has to be.  And when the pool is full, when I close it in the fall, and then when I uncover it in the summer, there is no water left in the pool.  So, obviously, it's the hole in the lowest point of the pool, which is either the main drain or the main feed. 
[00:27:00]  See, there's water that comes out of the bottom of the pool and water that's sucked into the bottom of the pool through different, like, pipes.  So, the new guys, shouldn't they figure that out?  I said that!  Because, yeah, if you're losing all the water, that's the only possibility.  They probably want it to be anything but that, because those are the hardest ones to fix, I bet.  Look, at this point, here's what would fix it.  Plug the fucking bottom drains up. 
[00:27:30]  I will run the entire summer just on skimmers, and then in fall, you can do whatever the fuck you want.  Can you do that?  Dig up the whole backyard.  Sure.  There's no real...  You don't need the water from the bottom drain to be...  Maybe you're using cheap water.  You think it's cheap water?  It evaporates it.  It's very easily evaporated.  I need heavy nuclear water.  I need an extra molecule.  Right.  Cutting corners with your water, I see.  Yeah, that must be it. 
[00:28:00]  So, how does the extra water get in there?  How does it, like...  What, how do I refill it?  Yeah.  A hose.  Okay.  A hose is like a fucking slum.  I fucking gotta throw a hose in there and turn it on and figure out how much water's leaking to how much I'm putting in.  I have an autofill, also, which uses, like, the little ball system in a toilet bowl.  And if the level gets down a certain amount, it, you know, adds water.  But that isn't on yet, because they turned it off while they're trying to figure out where the leak's coming from.  So, in the meantime, it's like, you know, fuck it. 
[00:28:30]  But now, 91 degrees today.  Right.  91.  The water is an inch below the skimmers now.  And they're supposed to show up today to do more work on it.  I want to fucking use the fuck thing, fuck.  Well, what are they going to do today?  I don't know.  That's another thing.  I barely know what the fuck is going on.  It sounds like you're starting to get mad at the new guys.  I am getting mad at everything.  At the new guys.  I, everything.  You gave them a chance, and they're not figuring it out.  You know why?  It's just been too long. 
[00:29:00]  It's been too long.  I understand.  Oh, and I hear, oh, it's a very difficult problem.  This is a very hard one to figure out.  We're trying with it.  Too much time is going by.  I need this fixed right now.  Why don't you just start over?  Believe me, I've thought about it.  You have.  At this point, I'm just...  Just make the pool slightly bigger.  Just make it bigger?  Yeah, just dig all that shit out and start over.  Start over with a little bit of a bigger pool.  Of course, everyone has the solution for it on the lines.  Oh, they all know.  From all over the country.  They all know what it is. 
[00:29:30]  The pool has to be chopped out and done again.  I can tell them how to bomb that leak in the pool.  I've got to help Anthony with his pool.  Let's do a speed round.  I know how to fix Anthony's pool.  Do a speed round of some of these people that know how to fix my pool.  Let's give them, what, 15 seconds?  Yeah, whatever.  John, you've got 15 seconds to fix Anthony's pool.  All right, Anthony, listen.  Like you said, it is the bottom of the pool.  The main drain has to chop out, reset, light it over again, re-marble-dust it. 
[00:30:00]  If you only got two fittings in the bottom, feed in and drain out, that's your problem.  There are four fittings in the bottom.  Two in, two out.  All right, if they tested every fucking line and they said the lines are good, it's the fucking gunite.  If they brought it in with transit mix, the shit was probably in the barrel.  They dye-tested all around where the drain fitting meets.  And they gunite, and they re-marble-dusted around and cemented.  First they re-...  So they got you for a re-marble. 
[00:30:30]  It needed to be done anyway, because the modern comfort pools guy, when he marveled-dusted it, it looked like shit.  Right.  It looked like fucking shit.  And it was sandy, it was fucking, it was crap.  That's all well and good.  They got you for a new re-marble, but you needed that, but it seems like...  But it's still losing water.  Yeah, the problem was always the bottom drain.  Still losing water.  All right, thank you.  Next.  Uh, let's say hi to Mikey.  Mikey.  Hey.  Hey, Anthony.  What's up?  Hey, man.  Listen, I'm gonna tell you real quick, I'm in my truck driving. 
[00:31:00]  Uh-huh.  I'm going to get y'all.  All right.  Get some regular package of peanuts that you use in a box for shipping.  Uh-huh.  Fill the pool to the top of the level where it's full.  Throw that peanuts inside that water, and it will...  It will draw it to wherever it's leaking at.  Then peanuts will float, and it will draw where the leak is in that pool.  Even if it's in the bottom, they will come to the center of the pool where the leak's at. 
[00:31:30]  Oh!  You have to try this.  I've never heard that one before.  You have to try this.  I'm telling you, I've just seen it done so many times.  Can we get...  We gotta get packing peanuts for...  You have to try this.  I will try that.  Mars, could you get us packing peanuts?  Oh, I got plenty of packing peanuts.  Oh, you know?  Okay.  Oh, please.  Are you saying you're packing peanuts?  No, I just get shit shipped to my house every fucking day.  I love Mike's idea.  I love it.  That's a good one.  Thank you.  I've seen it work, bro.  All right. 
[00:32:00]  All right.  Yes!  Mike!  The center with the packing peanut.  Thank you, sir.  Mike, we're on it.  I think he's gonna try your idea.  All right.  Let me say hi to Jeff in D.C.  Jeff.  Anthony, you're dealing with nitwits.  Uh-oh.  Have you guys showed up with a nice big toe behind the air compressor and actually put  pressure in these lines?  Yes, they have.  And you watched them do it?  No, I didn't.  I was much too busy in my house doing things, making videos.  I understand. 
[00:32:30]  You need to have Keith or somebody who you trust watch them and see what they're not doing.  Or does it lose more water when it's running than when it's sitting?  There has been 18,000 incarnations of what these guys have done.  Running, not running, running through the skimmers, running through the bottom, running  through both, only the jacuzzi.  The jacuzzi empty, the jacuzzi full, the jacuzzi...  Every single combination to the point where I lost track of what the fuck.  But...  This is not that hard.  Exactly. 
[00:33:00]  If you had their head and their ass wired together, they could find it in a day.  Okay, so I got a wire together.  They're head and their ass first.  Okay.  Right.  Thank you, sir.  Let's see.  You just die.  I've done that before.  And on Twitter, Anal Trainer.  Anal Trainer 610 writes, Anthony Cumia, I know a little something about plugging holes.  I'll fix your pool.  Let's go on to...  Who's this?  Hey, I got a good suggestion.  What you ought to do is get a sign that says O-O-L.  And then it says, notice there's no... 
[00:33:30]  Notice there's no pee in our pool.  Please keep it that way.  You know, just to add a little levity to the situation.  Humor helps.  Humor?  Humor.  That doesn't solve...  You gotta have a sense of humor.  Humor.  That doesn't solve my problem with the water leaking out, sir.  Fix your pool, cocksucker.  What else am I supposed to do this summer?  Humor. 
[00:34:00]  Garbage.  Yes, garbage.  All right.  That suggestion wasn't very nice.  But the O-O-L sign, it might be fun.  It could be fun.  A little humor.  Fun for everyone.  As he says, humor.  O-O-L.  No pee.  He could barely get it out.  He was laughing so hard at that joke.  He loved that one.  He did.  Yeah, that was a good one.  All right.  Wow.  So, man.  It's the bottom drains.  It's gotta be...  And you told these guys there was no water by the time that... 
[00:34:30]  Yes.  You'd take that cover off for the first time?  Right from the start.  Do you think they wanted to get you for the extra, um...  What did you just say?  I think I said it.  The marble dusting.  The marble dusting.  Maybe that was it.  I know.  Maybe that's just what companies...  Any company would do it.  You know what?  They did have to fix some...  There were hollow spots because the guy that originally did it from Modern Comfort Pool just  did such a shitty job.  Right.  It needed to be re-marble-dusted.  It needed.  It looked like crap.  There were big stains in the bottom, like where the mixture wasn't uniform and stuff. 
[00:35:00]  It's terrible.  But, um...  Now I'm just waiting for these guys.  But today is it.  That's it.  And if I get a guy like this fucking guy on the phone that, uh...  With the packing peanuts and he wanted to come by and figure it out, I'd be like,  Well, there you go.  You're cordially invited.  I wouldn't use those, though, because they're too...  They fly away.  Get bricks.  Can you try the packing peanuts?  I would give that a try.  I would assume it's got to be done on a very calm day because the wind will brush those 
[00:35:30]  right across the top of the pool.  It sounds like it might just work, though.  I don't understand how from the bottom.  Is it that sensitive where...  He says they'll all just collect in the middle of the pool.  Collect where?  Over where the drain is.  How long, though?  Like, how long does it take?  Because that's a pretty big pool.  Does it take an hour?  20 years.  Oh, see, that wouldn't be worth the wait.  What I would do is throw them in the pool right before you fucking crash for the night.  And then by the time you get home from the radio show, you'll have an idea.  Yeah.  You've got to try it. 
[00:36:00]  I'm so curious.  I'm ready to just drain it and throw fucking dirt and old tires in it.  Like fucking mastic.  God damn it.  Or get your helicopter to hover and see if you can observe all night.  Oh, I'll do that.  The Predator drone.  Yes.  I'll threaten the workers with some kind of Predator strike.  Oh, boy.  I got a bad phone call for you.  Huh?  This could be a bad one.  Let's go to Jay on Long Island.  Jay?  Hey, Anthony.  Good morning.  Hi.  So sorry to hear about your pool issues. 
[00:36:30]  Thank you.  I know it's tragic.  Just so you know, Anthony, modern comfort pools, they design their pools with what they  call a honeycomb design underneath, in like the sides going into the ground.  Chances are honeycomb designs will leak eventually.  It may not be the drain.  It may be the honeycomb leak within the honeycomb design.  And the water is simply going into the sides of the ground around your pool.  But they re-marble dusted.  I had guys come in and they re-marble dusted everything.  So it can't be the structure of the pool itself anymore. 
[00:37:00]  What's a honeycomb design?  What's that mean?  I have no idea.  So what's that mean?  Behind the pool itself?  Yeah.  If you look on their website, it shows you a picture of it.  The design that goes, it's braced into the ground.  Even marble dusting may not take some time, Dan.  But I don't know.  Can I ask you a simple question?  Did the modern pool guys call you?  No.  No, no, no.  I'm talking to Ed.  Yes, you, sir.  They call you.  Initially.  Initially, when you realize there's something wrong with the pool they put in,  did you call those guys?  Yes.  And what did they say to you?  They came by and said this and said that and the other thing. 
[00:37:30]  It just didn't.  But they didn't do anything.  No.  That's their fucking...  What did they say?  It was very difficult to get them on the phone in the first place.  They said they sent down and put a...  Fuck, some kind of check valve wasn't in the drain and this, that.  They fucking had no clue and they bullshitted their way through the whole thing.  They normally put in liner pools.  I guess they weren't very good with gunite. 
[00:38:00]  They just fucked me.  They fucked me over there at modern comfort shit pools.  Over 30 years experience, fucking Anthony Cumia.  That's awesome.  Bastards.  Got to be amateurs.  They are.  All right, Jay.  Thank you, sir.  Good weekend, man.  Yeah, you too, man.  Oh, well.  Yeah.  Honeycomb.  It's going to be, what, 91 today?  Honeycomb cereal was always too big.  Yeah, but you know what the best part of that was? 
[00:38:30]  Come to the Honeycomb hideout!  You like the Honeycomb hideout?  Sure.  Hey, you want some cereal?  Yo, take off your underpants in the Honeycomb hideout.  Get them all sticky with honeycombs.  Oh, Jesus.  Go, Paul.  Yeah, you're going to come in the Honeycomb hideout.  I've gotten into a cereal.  Oh, she's this poor kid.  A.  Marybill.  Oh, come on.  We need a clip of just her. 
[00:39:00]  I'm obsessing about this dumb fucking spelling bee broad.  We need just her.  She's in a complete panic trying to spell this word, but they put her in a montage of other  spelling bee shit.  Yeah.  When she's the one, man.  She's the fucking...  They keep going back to her.  I want the whole clip of her.  I can just spell a word.  Here.  O.  T.  O.  The pressure.  But then they stop and they go to all the fucking shit.  The stress and pressure on that kid is hilarious.  She's fucking dying. 
[00:39:30]  There's got to be a clip of just her trying to spell that word because she's losing her  shit over it.  P.  Do they go back to her?  She's like almost crying.  Because the rest of this piece is who gives a fuck.  Yeah.  I don't want to see kids that know how to spell.  Let me see.  Oh, yeah.  I love those kids.  Come on.  They don't go back to her again?  No.  I just want to watch her freaking out.  It's great.  Oh, well.  All right.  I got fucking...  I tried one of those ones.  Those are tough. 
[00:40:00]  Why?  Fucking spelling bees.  They are.  It's very hard to spell some of those big words.  They knock me out with bus.  Bus.  Yeah, I thought there were two S's in that word.  I was fucking off.  If I did it wrong, I would have said B-S-U-S.  Did you go...  I thought the first S was silent.  Did you go through the whole thing and say, you know, origin, use it in a sentence?  Yeah, I said, I often, I said, I bet I could use that in a sentence.  Hey, guys, where's the bus?  I got another idea coming in. 
[00:40:30]  Oh, yeah?  Yeah.  You put sand around the bottom drain.  Yeah?  Yeah, and then it'll, you know...  It'll creep in?  Yeah, I guess you can't use the pool until you fucking see what the sand does.  See, here's the problem.  It's 90 degrees today.  Well, just use your pool today.  I'm going to use the pool and have a nice, relaxing day with fucking pool guys rummaging  around my yard with the pool water down a good foot below where it's supposed to be. 
[00:41:00]  You still got a few more feet?  No.  To enjoy yourself?  Bunch of Mexicans in the yard?  I can't have that.  I want to fucking relax.  Thank God Mars is Hispanic.  Well, he's Puerto Rican.  Puerto Rican.  Puerto Ricans don't like Mexicans.  You don't like Mexicans, right?  Nope.  Why?  I don't know.  They don't get along.  You know.  Two different things, I guess.  Yeah.  So, yeah.  I know people. 
[00:41:30]  Just don't tear up about my problems.  I love this Toronto mayor.  Oh, the crack guy?  Yeah, he is toast.  He just banged his head into the camera.  I love him.  Oh, shit.  He held a press conference yesterday to say nothing.  And I guess everyone is kind of quitting around him.  He looks guilty.  It looks bad.  They're leaving the sinking ship.  Yeah.  Oh, shit.  I just love how he talks.  Do you have the original clip?  I never use crack cocaine. 
[00:42:00]  Can't do the Canadian accent, but I love him.  Well, he did a press conference yesterday.  I want to hear that.  I was elected to keep taxes low and to reduce the size and cost of government, and that's  exactly what I'm doing every single day.  I've been interviewing candidates all week, and I look forward to hiring new staff.  He has to hire new staff because his staff is leaving him.  They're leaving.  So now he's interviewing new people to take their positions. 
[00:42:30]  I look forward to hiring new staff as soon as possible.  Thank you very much.  Have you done any illegal drugs since you've been there?  Anything else?  Have you tried to obtain the video, sir?  Anything else?  Are you upset that Joe's home and he says he believes there is tape?  Are you upset that the deputy mayor says he believes there is tape?  Does that upset you?  Anything else?  What do they think?  What does this fucking idiot think they want to talk about?  Of course.  Like, anything else?  Yeah.  So how do you plan on spending your summer?  Anything else? 
[00:43:00]  Not Anthony's pool?  Yeah.  Yeah, they want to talk about the elephant in the room.  Oh, Jesus.  Oh, wow.  It's just...  It's already implied.  He's just getting angry.  Oh, he really is.  Hey, we've got to set you.  Anyone else?  The premier suggests he's ready to step in if needed.  I think the premier should take care of the problems that she has at Queen's Park right 
[00:43:30]  now.  Did you mention an address to David Price?  Anything else?  How did you know it?  Sir?  Anything else?  How did you know it?  What's going on in your office?  There's nothing going on in my office, obviously.  I'm bringing in new staff.  And if people have a better opportunity, I encourage them to move on.  So you think five people have a better opportunity?  I guess maybe...  I don't get into personnel issues, but maybe they can answer your question better than I  can.  Why can't I...  I'm not stepping aside. 
[00:44:00]  I'm running in the next election.  And if the great people of this city want to go in a different direction, that's what  their progative is.  Wow.  That's a...  Wow.  That's a guy that doesn't want to answer questions.  You think the tape will eventually surface?  Because where are we at with that?  They raise enough money.  But the people that have the original tape of him supposedly smoking crack cocaine, smoking 
[00:44:30]  crack, they can't get a hold of him anymore, right?  Yeah.  But then they had somebody on one of the news channels yesterday, and he said he absolutely  saw the video.  Oh, really?  Yeah, on a cell phone.  Cell phone video.  That's how it usually happens.  This guy seemed pretty legit.  He was in the know up there, I guess.  I don't know.  Legit.  Oh.  So.  Hmm.  Well, good for him. 
[00:45:00]  He's sticking to his guns and not answering shit.  Anything else?  They'll be like, yeah.  This question I asked.  Yeah.  That's what I want to hear.  That's what everybody wants to know.  Everyone wants to know that.  There's not one other question, when you say anything else, that we could ask that anybody  wants to know about right now.  Why don't you address the issues that people are clamoring about, sir?  In our humble opinion, it seems like he smoked crack cocaine.  Because why wouldn't you the whole time go, no, no, no, this is stupid, of course not. 
[00:45:30]  If you didn't, and you knew there was no tape out there.  Show me the video.  Where is the video?  No tape.  No witnesses.  No video.  Because, you know, you didn't do it.  Wouldn't you say, you know, were you smoking crack?  No.  I will say, no, I will base everything, my existence, on the fact that I did not do that.  So, when they don't do that, it leads me to believe they fucking did it.  Of course.  Yes.  Yes.  Got to say in our opinion. 
[00:46:00]  Yeah.  Just to keep ourselves safe.  But, yeah.  It doesn't look good.  I bet he smoked crack.  I think he smoked crack.  I think he did.  And I think there's a video out there.  But he's got to just go, that don't make no sense.  Oh, shit.  Wow.  What?  Oh.  Can we get the spelling bee girl?  Is that Jimmy doing chip?  Yeah, just saying.  Is there any way to find that spelling bee girl panicking?  I definitely want to see.  I don't know why.  Maybe the rest of her spelling that word isn't that great.  That's what they're showing. 
[00:46:30]  We should see her spelling that entire word.  She's losing her fucking mind.  Or whatever word it was that she got knocked out of.  Right.  That's what I want to say.  One of the people in the video was found dead, according to Brady in Canada.  Well, he was smoking crack with crackheads, wasn't he?  So the odds are.  Yeah.  Back to the Toronto mayor.  Sorry.  Brady, go ahead.  Yeah.  It just came out on the news the other day that I guess one of the people in the video  was found dead, shot or whatever.  And so now, like, he's being questioned by police and a bunch of his staffers are being 
[00:47:00]  questioned and everything.  They're being fully investigated for us.  How can you question a guy that's dead?  No, the mayor.  They're questioning the mayor.  I know.  That's just how you said it.  Question the dead guy.  Just the way you said it.  It's not like they're going to try to question the dead guy.  That's her right there, right?  Yeah, that's her.  Right there.  Eva?  Yeah.  All right, Brady.  Thank you.  Eva was a little nervous.  Nellie.  Oh, C.  A. 
[00:47:30]  P.  She was great.  The amount of pressure.  Oh, she was feeling it, huh?  Wow.  If you could find her.  If not, whatever.  Whatever.  That's the highlight.  Not watching another kid of Indian descent win the fucking spelling bee.  Yeah.  You really know how to spell, huh?  You know what?  You get some foreign children that come over here.  Either, you know, first, second generation immigrants. 
[00:48:00]  They always kick our ass.  They are fucking.  Because there's an amazing want to excel, to use this wonderful country of ours to boost  yourself, use the opportunity.  Not the fact that you could freeload, but the opportunity.  Going to school, learning.  And then they excel.  You see these Asian students that come over from Korea, various other Asian lands.  You see the Indian children.  From the Wangtang province. 
[00:48:30]  From the Chongfa province.  If you're from a province, you want to be here so bad.  Right.  Where are you from?  Wangtang province.  I'm from the Chongfa province of Hengtang.  Yeah.  Talk like a model airplane sometimes.  Is that bad?  No.  That's, you know, that's what it is.  What are you going to do?  We all know that to be true.  Let's zoom in who here. 
[00:49:00]  Anyway.  Yeah.  Yeah.  So they excel.  Yeah.  They do very well.  They spell big words.  I guess they changed the spelling bee where you have to know what the word means now,  too.  That sucks.  Yeah.  Fuck that.  It's a spelling bee, not a definition bee.  They changed it.  Not only do you have to spell it, you have to know what it means.  Means?  A huge change in the way they did the spelling bee.  I don't like that at all.  I'm boycotting the next spelling bee.  I think it's good enough to fucking be able to spell the word. 
[00:49:30]  Exactly.  They used to give the definition, right?  Yeah.  Yeah.  You'd have to ask, definition?  Right.  Origin?  Origin.  Origin?  From the Greek word.  Right.  Uh, Nostradamus.  Where's our food?  Let's eat.  I got mines.  You got yours.  I got mines right here.  All right, then let's start eating.  All right, let's do that.  We got, uh, we got to talk about mermaids.  What the fuck's going on with the mermaid thing?  That shit is stupid. 
[00:50:00]  And wasn't that old?  It was old, right?  Wasn't that on, like, we talked about it a while ago?  Yes, we did.  But now they're making a big thing, like, it's fake.  But then, I just saw a headline that says, uh, the mermaids hooking viewers.  So, why?  People are buying into it?  No.  Stupid.  Totally fake, fake, fake, totally fake.  All right, we'll talk about mermaids, and, um, it's more of a visual, but I'm sure most  of us have seen the Prancercise video by now.  Oh.  That fucking thing went viral, huh?  Did you see it, Jim?  I just can't stand it. 
[00:50:30]  Enough.  Ready.  Prancercise?  Enough.  Why?  Because so many people are tweeting me.  First of all, I think it's fake.  Right?  It seems fake.  It doesn't.  Yes.  I think she's just a kook.  I think she's a crazy old broad.  I think she's just a kook.  She's too old to be fake.  Oh, no, enough with the fucking, oh, she's got a camel toe with a camel toe.  I made the fucking screen large.  Where's her cunt?  Jimmy's pissed off.  I'm tired and cranky today, Matt.  Why? 
[00:51:00]  I just, uh.  What happened?  Uh-oh.  Um, I'm mad at myself.  Why?  I taped something yesterday, which turned out good, but I wish I hadn't, uh, I did, uh,  Kamau Bell's show last night, debating a feminist.  Yes.  And, uh, it was fine.  I mean, I was happy I did.  I liked Kamau.  It was good.  But, and they told me before that they were pre-taping it and they were going to edit  it down.  Uh-oh. 
[00:51:30]  Uh, they're just working on it.  They weren't trying to hurt anybody or trying to edit or censor.  They were just literally, it's a new.  For time and all that shit.  Exactly.  It's a new segment.  Right.  So it aired and I didn't watch it, but I heard it came out okay.  But I liked the live interaction the girl and I had.  Ah.  But I'm really mad at myself that I did something that I knew was going to be edited down.  No one was sneaky.  Nobody was duplicitous.  It was nothing like that.  I'm just a little mad at myself that I, uh.  Whenever I do stuff like that, like on Hanley or anything, it's always, this is what you  got and this is what we said.  Right. 
[00:52:00]  So I'm just concerned that, uh, it didn't look the way I would have wanted it to look.  And I should have known that going in because they told me.  Do we have the clip?  No, because I haven't watched it.  I won't watch it.  Oh, you won't watch it?  No.  Uh, it's the full version supposed to be online, but I've been obsessing about it.  I'm so fucking mad at myself, uh, for doing that.  And again, I'm not angry with Hanley.  There was nobody over there.  It was very nice.  Nobody was anything but honest.  They were totally honest.  Because the live, live, you did something.  You talk more.  Right.  Like, picture us having a 15 minute debate whittled down to five minutes. 
[00:52:30]  Uh-huh.  Um, and I'm just like, I just, I normally would have said I would prefer it, like every  other one of those.  You needed a long form.  Or, you just, if we have six minutes, we have six minutes.  Right.  But I, I kind of, I think I get what you're trying to say.  Yeah.  Like, you, you decide to go down this road, but then realize that the only way this works  is if it's, you know, long form and complete without edits.  Yes.  Or if you just do six minutes because you only have six minutes.  Right.  Then we just talk for six.  But you chose something that you knew would be edited, which might get a little, little. 
[00:53:00]  Yeah.  And, uh, it was, it was still.  A little shady or whatever.  Yeah.  It wasn't a bad experience.  It was like, you know what I mean?  I actually liked, it was, it was the girl who wrote the blog, uh, bashing all comics  who do rape jokes.  Uh-huh.  But, uh, you know, she's actually, I kind of liked her.  She wasn't, uh, you know, she's just got her thing.  And, uh, I like come out.  I just, it's my own thing.  Like, why would I do something that I knew it was going to be?  And I'm fucking, I couldn't sleep less.  I was so fucking mad at myself.  Um.  Oh, I slept like a baby. 
[00:53:30]  Oh, fuck, man.  I got training at 11.15 too.  That, uh, chick that you were on Hannity with?  Oh, that was, see, that was.  How I, yeah, I liked, I liked her too, actually.  She was kind of cute.  She was beautiful, but she was okay.  People really gave her a hard time.  Guys were calling her a cunt.  I'm like, I think.  What she's saying was, it sounded ridiculous.  I thought she was wrong, yeah.  That clip made, uh, Huffington Post yesterday.  It did, yeah.  And that's another thing that bothers me.  You got some action yesterday.  Like, I had a really good week of, like, uh, uh, of, and Michelle Beadle said something  nice about me on her show yesterday. 
[00:54:00]  And I'm doing her show today.  Like, it's been just a good week with that stuff.  And then I did something, I'm like, I was just, I'm like, ah.  When do we get Michelle Beadle on this show?  I know Sam had her.  Sure, she'll come on.  Yeah.  Let's get her on, man.  She'd come on whenever.  All right.  Come on on today.  Well, she's probably not awake yet.  Well, you said whenever.  Yeah, you probably would book her.  Yeah, let's do it today.  Booger.  Book.  Oh.  Michelle Beadle, come on our show today.  Let's go.  It's Friday.  I don't think we have anyone really, uh, scheduled.  Maybe Kevin Pollack calling to say hi. 
[00:54:30]  That's about it today.  She's very popular.  Yes, and podcast number three, the Opie and Anthony podcast, doing very well.  Ooh.  Uh, but we want people to subscribe so we get fake numbers.  Fake?  Yeah.  It's just so it downloads automatically.  Yeah, so it downloads automatically.  Oh.  So it makes us look even bigger than we really are.  Whether you listen or not.  Right, exactly.  Subscribe, and then we get, we get the credit.  We get, you know, some fake numbers out there.  They'll probably still listen if they subscribe.  Um, uh, yeah, but some won't.  Yeah. 
[00:55:00]  But at least subscribe, and then we get credit for you technically listening.  What's on, uh, the third podcast again?  I know it's Bernie Goetz.  Bernie Goetz, Lady Di.  He scared the shit out of us.  Yeah.  Lady Di and her drinking problems from 2005.  Right.  Went way back, like eight years for that one.  Okay.  Oh, here comes the word.  And, uh, Jeffrey Tambor with Mick Foley and Annie Letterman in studio.  Oh, that was a great fucking time.  Yeah, it was a great show. 
[00:55:30]  And anything else?  And, uh, the, at the end, after the.  What do you mean at the end?  At the end of the podcast, what?  Right, after the, uh, closer, there's a.  A what?  There's a nugget.  The Opie and Anthony Nugget.  Yeah, there's a nugget.  I hate that it's got the name to it.  The Opie and Anthony Nugget.  What is it this week again?  This week, it's, uh, Jimmy Dean's Sausages. 
[00:56:00]  Oh, yeah.  It's one of my favorite fucking phone calls ever.  Mm.  All right.  You go to iTunes.  I still get people tweeting.  For some, I don't understand people that have an Android phone or, or a phone that's  not, not an iPhone and they can't figure out how to get our podcast.  I don't get that.  People don't want to do work.  They just want to tweet.  I suck at technology and I figured it out.  Mm-hmm.  Yeah, it's not difficult.  What's the app that everybody uses?  What's the app that you use in Android?  I'm using, uh, Beyond, uh, Pod.  Beyond Pod is the one people use.  So, Beyond Pod, then I just search Opie and Anthony, there it is, and then I subscribe 
[00:56:30]  and boom, I'm good.  Right.  I don't understand why people are like, I don't know how to get this podcast because  I don't have an iPhone.  I don't understand that.  Well, they don't want to do work and so they just figure, I just tweet.  Right.  Like, the host of the show, our help support.  Mm-hmm.  So, don't, don't ask me.  I'm not, I'm not that good at tech shit.  I'm learning every day, but.  Just download Beyond Pod on Android.  By the way, good news.  Free app.  What is it?  I got past, uh, Candy Crush, uh, level 134.  Which moved me right into 135, which is a motherfucker. 
[00:57:00]  But as I was waiting for the Seth Rogen movie to start, I didn't feel like talking  rolling, so I started doing Candy Crush and I got through level 135 as well as I sat  there.  Wow.  I lucked out because that's a motherfucker level.  It was just you and Roland?  Yeah.  It's really rude.  Yeah, he kind of pointed that out.  Yeah.  I go, yeah, but I got to get past this level.  Yeah.  And then he understood.  No, he didn't.  What's ruder?  Me playing a quick round of maybe three minutes of Candy Crush or him sleeping the entire fucking 
[00:57:30]  movie sideways?  Well, once the movie started.  When his entire, from his hips up was, was in the aisle like this.  Why wouldn't you wake him up at that point and be like, Roland, you're in the fucking  aisle.  And snoring, because I don't know.  Yeah.  I don't want to wake him up.  We've seen him angry.  Yeah.  I would imagine if you wake him up, he gets angry.  He seems like that type of guy.  Cranky.  And I'm fucking mad I didn't get a video or a picture of him sleeping sideways like 
[00:58:00]  that.  It was amazing.  It was amazing.  I've never seen anything like it in my life.  But you should always, if you think you need Flash, snap the picture anyway.  And then just look.  And see if you can fix it in the post.  You're right.  Yeah.  Lighten the shit out of it.  Yeah, you can lighten some shit up.  You get a little grainy, but at least you got something.  I fucking panicked.  Oh, man.  I had a good fucking opportunity last night.  I just didn't do it.  Yeah.  All right.  You got anything for break?  Can we do this?  There's a bit I wanted to see if he could play.  Anyway, it was that whole July 20th fucking anti-social plug thing we did. 
[00:58:30]  It was like, remember the bit we did?  I think we did this already.  No, it was really good when I said that.  Tickets go on sale this morning at 10 a.m. for me, Amy, Artie, and David Tell in Bethlehem,  PA on July the 20th.  I'm sure I'll have to fucking cat dance and beg for people to buy tickets to this one until  the day of the show.  No.  No way.  No fucking way.  This one's going to sell fast, man. 
[00:59:00]  Yeah, we saw the video of Kanye West walking into a pole.  Thank you, Megan.  Two weeks ago.  Yeah.  Fuck.  What the fuck?  E-Rock's got something really good for break.  All right, cool.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  On SiriusXM.  The Opie and Anthony Channel.  Channel, channel, channel, channel, channel. 
[00:59:30]  On SiriusXM.  This song about the truth.  I wrote it about a lady I was seeing not too long ago.  Hopefully, I'll remember the lyrics this time.  Have a seat and listen.  Please don't say a thing.  In matters of the heart sometimes, the truth will have a sting.  Just don't take it personally.  This is no attack. 
[01:00:00]  But we will never last.  Because I'm white and you are also white.  I only like black girls, the brown girls, the cafe au lait.  The caramel girls and mocha girls just blow me away.  If you are newbie and I want you to be in every fantasy.  But if you're a whitey, say nighty-nighty.  You're just not the girl for me.  Woo-hoo.  Well, her body is a turn-on, curvaceous front and back. 
[01:00:30]  Her hair is quite literally an aphrodisiac.  Don't call it jungle fever, because that just isn't right.  I am not a racist.  Some of my best friends are white.  I just prefer black girls, the brown girls, the cafe au lait.  The caramel girls and mocha girls just blow me away.  Well, if you're a cracker, you better get blacker, or else you best get out. 
[01:01:00]  It is no mystery.  I like a sister.  See, that's what I'm talking about.  Ooh.  Oh, man, I hate vanilla ice cream.  White rice is so bland.  The milk chocolate melts in your mouth, not in your hand.  But color is not the issue here.  It's dignity.  It's class.  It's all about her heart.  Okay, it's partly about that ass.  I want me some black girls, the brown girls, the cafe au lait. 
[01:01:30]  The caramel girls and mocha girls just blow me away.  Well, if you're a honky, you're singing the wrong key.  It's the honest truth.  The skin that she's dwelling in must contain melanin.  That is the fountain of youth.  Ooh.  Thomas Jefferson.  Robert De Niro.  Well, strong thermal. 
[01:02:00]  Strong thermal.  Yeah.  Nice.  Yes.  Thank you.  I ain't happy, I'm feeling glad I got sunshine 
[01:02:30]  In a bag I'm useless  But not for long, the future  I ain't happy, I'm feeling glad I got sunshine  In a bag I'm useless  This is a very thousand song, Gorillaz  Oh, very good, very good  I've never listened to their music and I've always seen the signs for them  My cage 
[01:03:00]  Oh, I thought it was techno-gorillaz  Techno-gorillaz rap?  Yeah, they do a little of everything  I like a few songs by these guys  Opie and Anthony and old  Jimmy Norton 2  It's Friday  I forgot there was one other thing that happened at the movie theater yesterday  With Roland  I love going to movies with Roland  Yeah, I really do  Because he's very good at saving very good seats 
[01:03:30]  He was talking about this thing called the cronut  And I thought he was lying  I really thought he was lying  He was trying to tell me that people line up at 5, 5.30 in the morning to get a cronut  It's like a croissant slash donut, obviously  What the hell are people up to?  And he's telling me this whole story  And I'm like, almost rolling my eyes  Like, there's no fucking way people are lining up at 5, 5.30 in the morning for a cronut  Uh-huh  And then I opened up the paper today 
[01:04:00]  What is it?  The Daily News  Page 9  Line starts at dawn for treats  But at $5 a piece  No reason to go nuts for cronuts  Wow  But this is what Roland was talking about  Why are people waiting on a fucking line like that for this?  I've never waited on a line for something  Unless I have to  You know what I mean?  Like, I've never gone out  I guess what I'm trying to say is  I've never gone out of my way to wait on a line  No 
[01:04:30]  Have you?  For anything?  Not unless you have to  Like motor vehicle  Apple products, anything?  Concert tickets I did years ago for Ozzy  I stayed out all night for him  Did you?  Yeah, once  I understand that  I do understand that  For your favorite band and stuff  But in general  Why would you wait on line at 5.30 in the morning  Just to have a cronut?  That, no way  Aren't they serving them at 9 o'clock  When everyone goes to work?  Or 8.45?  Or, I don't know  Huh?  They sell out  Oh, they sell out, that's why? 
[01:05:00]  8 a.m  Why didn't he make more?  Thank you  I hate that shit  Oh, it's sold out  But just make more then  You finally come up with a product  That everyone wants  And you're still selling out  Fuck that  You're losing money  Or does that help the, you know  The whole process  Because if they limit it to 200 a day  Then the newspapers will write about the people lined up outside the store  But if you're selling out  Then I think you could squeeze an extra hundred before you sell out  That's how I would look at it  What's in a cronut?  It's just a combo  It's a croissant donut  Yeah  I don't get it 
[01:05:30]  It looks flaky  And they interviewed people online  This guy just says  I don't even care what it tastes like  I just want one  Like what?  So you're going to wait around  And you don't even know what it tastes like?  How do you feel about a vagina?  I don't know  Go for him  Golden sugar  It's made from a croissant-like dough  That's fried in grapeseed oil 
[01:06:00]  Yuck  What's grapeseed oil?  I don't know  Then the baker inserts a creamy filling in the middle  Uh-oh  That sounds fucking perverted  The cronut's rolled in sugar  Then the top is glazed with frosting flavors  Like rose vanilla or lemon maple  That sounds great  I just wouldn't wait online for it  We should make someone get us some  Do you want to try them?  Make someone fucking stand online  There's a  For us  There's a black market for that  Is there?  Like people are delivering 
[01:06:30]  They go  And then it says here  In Manhattan they charge $20  In Queens they charge $30  In Vermont  No one's doing that  For what?  No one's doing that  No one's doing that  No  They go  They get six  Because that's the max you can get  Right  And then they sell them  No  This is insanity  No one's buying a $40 cronut  Oh no  Travis  Except maybe he's from a crow who's had cancer  Well  This probably will not come as a surprise to anyone 
[01:07:00]  But Roland is friends with the chef who makes them  Of course  Oh well  Where did you meet these people?  I don't know  But Roland was telling me about this like weeks ago  He told me last night  He was obsessed with it  Then I saw it on Gothamist  Is this Dunkin' Donuts?  No  No  It's one  It's a legit bakery  Oh okay  I thought it was Dunkin' Donuts  It's a bakery in  Where is it?  Soho?  It looks like  Yeah  Ansel Bakery  So then I see it on Gothamist earlier in the week  And then the New York Post reports on it 
[01:07:30]  Oh boy  Yesterday  And I'm like  Roland knows what the fuck he's talking about  Like  Sometimes it comes off like he doesn't  And he's just like  Oh yeah  Cronuts  Yeah  But he's right  So anyway  He is arranging  Some cronuts for us  Today?  I don't know if it's going to be today  Cronut Day  But it's going to be soon  Alright  Yeah  It would be nice for us today  Let's all have a chew  It's that foodie world  Chew  Let's all have a chew  It's that foodie world  Yeah  He's in  He's in the know  Like something pops up  He was on this way before anyone else 
[01:08:00]  Pops up and people just have to go and try it right?  Yeah  You see a line  You get on  But who cares what you're waiting for?  I wanted to eat your cronut first  Well now you've had your cronut  I'm a dollar  Everybody seems to know  You've had your cronut  It really is an awful sounding thing  You called those cronuts?  Did you eat them?  You called those cronuts? 
[01:08:30]  Cronut  I turn the page in the paper  Look at this  Justin Bieber partying with the bitches  What is this?  He looks ridiculous  He just looks silly  And he looks like he can't handle these girls  Doesn't look authentic  Like there's two really hot girls  That I guess  Biebs was hanging out with in New York  And the problem is  He's underage  And he was in all these clubs  And the one girl has  Complete side boob  Yeah  Exposed  Oh look at that right?  There's no way that Biebs can handle that right? 
[01:09:00]  No  You think that Biebs can handle that Sam?  No  He doesn't know what he's doing  I don't think he can handle Selena Gomez  No one can handle Selena Gomez  Well  She's quite the dish  The Biebs  Looks silly  Because he still has the  Kind of look  And that  Well he's doing everything  He's trying to be badass  But it's not working  Yeah  He's dressing like the rapper's dress  I guess  Trying to look as badass as possible 
[01:09:30]  Is that a tat?  Yeah  He's got  Tats  He's got a few  To cover up the fact that he can't handle this shit  Right?  Yeah  If you can handle this shit  You just go out and handle this shit  Yeah  You don't dress up for it  Right?  He's got to dress the part  It's like he's putting on a costume  I don't know  So  He looks silly  Your son  Is attempting to bring  An outside pastry  Into this situation  A  Cronut  Cronut 
[01:10:00]  Cronut cook  Cronut  We were making fun  But now I think I want to try a Cronut  Yeah you want a Cronut?  Yeah I think they got me  If they bring me one  I'm going to throw it on the floor  I'm going to throw my Cronut on the floor  Because people want them so bad  Take the gun  Leave the Cronuts  Just stomp on them  Yeah I'm going to get a Cronut for Belle  Just go to the line  And throw it on the floor  Crawl from  Crawl like you 
[01:10:30]  Crawl from the Cronuts  I want an equal number of blueberries  In each Cronut  Do you know how long that would take?  Cronut  What's the princess size video about?  Can we take a look at that?  This is  Yeah  Yesterday  Jimmy thinks it's fake  I don't think so  Everyone was tweeting  I don't think Bill Broad's faked the videos  She's got a whole website  You've got to see this  You've got to see this  And I usually steer clear of those things  Because they're never good  But I clicked on this

[01:16:00]  So this show  Was so convincing  That many viewers  Were left scratching  Their heads  Wondering if  Mermaids  No they didn't  Are actually real  How stupid is America  Oh my god  What is that  Oh how crazy  So what is that creature  On top of a rock  Supposedly captured  On film  By tourists  Oh my god  What is it  Many watching  Animal Planets  Mermaids  The New Evidence 
[01:16:30]  Saw it as proof  That mermaids  Do exist  The show  Presented as a  Documentary  Details  Close Encounters  With the mythical  Sea Creatures  Dr. Paul Robertson  Welcome  It even featured  Guests  Purporting to be  Scientists  From the National  Oceanic and Atmospheric  Administration  Or NOAA  But it was all  In the name  Of entertainment  No shit  Everyone knows  This person is not  Is not really a scientist  So many viewers  Were fooled  NOAA  A federal agency 
[01:17:00]  Felt compelled  To issue a statement  Oh my god  We are  You're kidding  Neither NOAA  Neither NOAA nor its scientists  Are involved with anything  Related to this topic  We are fucking stupid  No one from NOAA  Was involved in making  The fictional show  And the person identified  As a NOAA scientist  Was an actor  If you watched the show  Closely enough  Animal Planet  Did include this disclaimer  During the closing credits  Certain events in this film  Are fictional  Disappointed viewers  The first trip to Twitter  After discovering the show 
[01:17:30]  Was fictional  Animal Planet  You are dead to me  You got me on your  Little Mermaid hoax  What was the freaking  Troy  Troy Barry  Is an idiot  You're dumb  He tweeted that  The fascination with  Mer people is not new  A wave of films like  Splash and the Little Mermaid  That's what you want  A girl with his  Out of pussy  Open people's imagination  To the possibility  Of life under the sea  Under the sea  Oh boy  That's apparently  What the filmmaker  Charlie Foley  Wanted  He told CNN  That the show  Is based on 
[01:18:00]  Real scientific  And evolutionary theory  And real life phenomena  Rooting our story  With facts  Encouraged a sense  Of intellectual  Possibility  Oh stop it  You made a hole  What is that  Oh my god  What is that  Acting in those  It looks like a sea lion  What could it be  What could it be  A sea lion  That's a female lion  People were duped  This was actually  A sequel  To the wildly successful  Mermaid's  The Body Found  Which aired last year  On Animal Planet  My favorite part of this  Besides the use  Of the word 
[01:18:30]  Merpeople  Is that  The government  Had to actually  Issue a denial  That it isn't  Studying merpeople  I kind of wish  They said  We had to cut back  On our merpeople  Investigations  Because of the sequester  I wonder how many  What percentage  Of the 3.6 million  People who watch that show  Really believe  They're watching  A true documentary  I think it's probably  Higher than  A lot  A lot  People are morons  And the government  Had to issue a statement  Why wouldn't the government  Go oh god  If you're that stupid  Yeah fuck you  Fuck you  Exactly  You know how many 
[01:19:00]  Videos I watch  That people are like  Holy shit  Check this out  I'm like  It's fucking fake  How do you even  Think this is real  Well the acting  Always gives it away  Yeah  Oh my god  What do you think  That is  And the way people  Work their cameras  They don't do that shit  Right  Like the UFO ones  Are always great  Right  It's always  Oh look at  Look at the skyline  This is  Whoa  Yeah  And then  That's just  They can never really  Get a good  Good view of it  It's gotta be shaky  People really  Fucking bought it 
[01:19:30]  Huh  Crazy  What percentage  Of all the people  Watching  What percentage  Do you think  Are really stupid  Of all the people  Watching  So you gotta watch  It in the first place  Yeah  99.9%  Alright  It's gotta be  Less than 10  Right  I don't  I don't know  Way less than 10%  Now one guy's like  Oh you got me  Animal Planet  You got me  With your little  Mermaid hoax  Why would you  Publicly put that 
[01:20:00]  Out there  Like  You look like  An idiot  You look like  The asshole  Right  You should write  You know  I knew the whole tone  Gullible  They're gullible  People  Fucking hate  This fucking  Commercial  Stupid  Fucking  Duck  Fucking  Working out  At the gym  You don't like  The affleck duck  No  I fucking  Hate it  I don't  Enjoy it at all  Alright  Back to  Prancercise  Oh where is she  Yes  She was  Getting  Prancercise on

[01:41:30]  Yep  So far so good  And then  I feel like I'm at the movie  This is great  And then they  They do some shenanigans  And then they  Attend the party  And then something happens  Oh  Is it an earthquake?  Or isn't it?  It was just  Jimmy just blasted  Right in the middle of  And then what happens?  I know a Roland's big review  Um  Chaos  Chaos, okay  And  Chaos 
[01:42:00]  Yeah  Throughout the whole movie  Ensues  Roland, when did you fall asleep?  Chaos  I looked over  I mean during this show?  I looked over  He was in a deep sleep  This wasn't even  This wasn't even  I've seen him do the quick cat nap  He'll take a couple minutes  During a slow  Part of a movie  But he'll be back in  You were out last night  My friend  Should've went double or nothing  On the last bet  And I was trying to get video  And I thought you'd fucking kill me 
[01:42:30]  And then I was worried about  The security guard  It's too hot in there  Dude, you were sleeping sideways  How do you do that?  You were  You had the aisle seat  I know  I woke up  And from your hips up  Was completely  On a 45 degree angle  In the  In the actual aisle  And  And you had a deep snore going  He was cracking up  He was cracking up  You were  I don't know how people  Could sleep in  Uncomfortable positions  He's crying  It was hot in there 
[01:43:00]  It was hot  I was like  Oh no  Hot and fatness  Does not mix  When did you decide  It's your right to sleep  Fuck it  I'm just gonna sleep  I don't  My body decided for me  And you didn't sleep  Because it was a bad movie  No  I want people to know that  I love this fucking movie  And I saw the last half  Not really  You're gonna have to see it  All over again  There was a point  Where the movie got really loud  A monster or something  And you woke up  Because you're like  What the fuck is going on  You thought the movie theater 
[01:43:30]  Was being attacked I think  Yeah  But  And I'm like  Oh okay  That'll wake him up  And nope  You went right back out  Yeah  I see  Next week they have  One more screening  And go  Go to this one  I am definitely gonna go  Seriously  Go before Seth comes in  The last  The ending was really good too  And it looks like  Seth Rogen's gonna come in  Right  Yep  He's coming in  When  A couple weeks  June 12th  When are there other  Screenings for it  June 4th is the last one  Were you awake when  Danny McBride showed up  In the movie  Yes  Is he a fucking pimp 
[01:44:00]  Yeah  He plays the ass  Of the group  I love him  He basically stole the movie  For a while  For a long while  And everyone else was great  But when he showed up  It was like  He's a fucking pimp  Yeah  And Hermione's hilarious  Yeah Hermione was great  She's a  Harry Potter  Sexy girl  Oh yeah  Michael Cera  Surprised the fuck out of me  He was  So fucking funny  Paul Rudd was there too  Oh yeah  That's right  They kind of make fun  Of themselves though  Yeah  See I was awake for that 
[01:44:30]  What's up  What's up  What's up  I'm in  All in  Why didn't you  If he  I hope he would have bet you  Would you have taken it  Or did you know  You were falling asleep  I would have  Took him to bed  Walked in the theater  And got  Fuck  No you were lost  There was no way  You were going to  Stay awake last night  I needed a coffee  Or something  You were really tired  No  No  It's not all about  Man  Alright your review  Was much better than mine  Well you can't  Really  My review sucked 
[01:45:00]  Because I feel like  You know you want to  Kind of not say too much  About this one  Yeah  Right  Because a lot of giveaways  A lot of giveaways  Can't wait for Danny McBride  To come back on the show  I'm telling you man  Holy fuck  Yeah I think he's filming right now  That's why he couldn't come in  What is he filming  I'm not sure  Oh we got to get him on again  Because they say  That he might be able  To call from the set  So they're trying to figure that out  Yeah have him call  Just so I can say  You're a fucking pimp  Okay  He's unbelievable  Alright Roland 
[01:45:30]  We're waiting for the  Prancercise broad  On the  Today show  Ooh  Yeah she's going to be on  I guess they teased it  At a  8.33  Oh that's when it's going to be on  Yeah yeah  Oh okay  They teased it  And showed the little clip of her  Prancing  Remember the kid that was like  Basically born in that  Fucking sewer pipe  Yeah yeah  Someone recommended  That I should put a Chinese baby  In the pipe in my pool  And that would  That would plug it up  And it would stop the leak  Nice 
[01:46:00]  Well  We got more info on that  China's a weird place  It certainly is  Mother of Chinese baby  Found in sewer pipes  Says she had a one night stand  And could not afford an abortion  Very dishonorable  Will not face criminal charges  What the fuck  Now why is that  I have no idea  It's a stupid fucking country  That's why  Cause obviously she was trying to kill the baby  Of course she was  Yeah  And she's not going to face charges  I don't know why  Maybe there's more in the actual story itself 
[01:46:30]  But she's not going to face charges  They are wacky over there  With things like that  It's just an awful country  Well they got a population problem right  So maybe  Yeah anytime they try to get rid of some people  I guess it's fair game  She did get a ticket for littering  Yeah  Yeah put the baby in the pipe  And she doesn't  No charges  None  God that's fucking amazing  Let's see  Who's on fucking  Oh they got  I'm trying to figure out 
[01:47:00]  Who's on the Fox News  A little concert series  They do  The summer concert series  Lone Star  I guess it's Lone Star  Oh really  They do Amazed  They better do Amazed  Oh man  Right  Or their other song  And then there was the other one  Kevin Pollack  Yes  Hello  From Philadelphia  Yes  Kevin  Here's your question today  Yes  Name the other song Lone Star did  No Can Do 
[01:47:30]  Really  How does that go  It was No Can Do  No Can Do  Playing Helium this weekend huh  Yeah  I'm not as familiar with Philly as you are by now  So please  I'm hoping for some  Some recommendations  Oh you gotta go to West Philly man  Yeah  Yep  And go see where Will Smith used to live  It's terrific  It's where all the tours are going these days  Oh yeah  Oh West Philly is where it's at  I bet it's not 
[01:48:00]  I bet it's stay away from that area  It seems like you're sending me to my peril  Yes  Have you checked out the Liberty Bell  That's kind of cool  Yeah  It actually is  In a ridiculous way  It's incredibly cool  But also there's  I passed by this giant signage for  It looks like a museum of  The display of spy and espionage  Or something  Oh that sounds kind of cool  No no  Yeah  No this is what  I guess that's cool 
[01:48:30]  Ant likes that type of thing  Of course it is  You gotta go to the  I'm probably gonna mispronounce it  The  Muter  Muter  Is that how they say it?  M-A-U-T-T-E-R  Whatever  Go to the Muter Museum  You'll thank us later  Oh okay  I'm not even kidding  It's like  It's a fucked up museum  Of all those like medical oddities  It's really strange  Oh yeah  You'll see some weird stuff in there  Two headed babies in jars  And  Yes  All that stuff  The soap woman  Yes  They buried some woman  By the side of a river  And through some weird chemical process 
[01:49:00]  Her body  Turned into  Lye soap  Her whole body  I'm in  I'm crazy  I'm serious  It's so different  I think you'll enjoy it  Oh I'm not kidding  I'm all the way in  That's fantastic  Yeah  I think it's M-U-T-T-E-R  Jimmy  Muter  Something like that  I used to have that shirt  I wore  An awful shirt  It's out of the way a little bit  It looks like it's in a house almost  And it's great  I love it  Muter Museum  Muter Museum  I'll make that face 
[01:49:30]  Like I don't really know  If I'm pronouncing it correctly  And then people will help me  I think that's how you say it  Muter  Something like that  And then call us Monday  And tell us what you thought  Oh yeah  It's crazy  I see Seth Rogan  Is threatening on Twitter  To follow with the  Bring Opiate Gift  Yes the Bring Opiate Gift thing  Is starting to take off a little bit  Thanks to Paul Anka  And Kevin Pollack  I know I'm feeling left out  I'm trying to get Anthony involved in this  Anthony I don't fucking blame you  What the hell  I know I'm like  I could use some nice crystal glasses  Or a nice refreshing picture 
[01:50:00]  Yeah  You know  I would actually use it  In my house  Well what happened was  I went and saw  This is the end  Or something like  Yeah this is the end  Seth Rogan's new movie last night  And I was so excited about the movie  I tweeted Seth Rogan  Actually I was brown nosing Seth Rogan  Let's be honest with each other  And then he said  Yeah I'm going to be on with you guys soon  And I guess I got to bring a gift  Like Kevin Pollack did  Yeah  No I saw that  Yeah it was pretty cool  And then I said back to him  Make sure it's a classic crumb 
[01:50:30]  Yes  Yes  I want to pass that right off to him  You know that classic crumb nonsense  Anyone that wants to get me a gift  Something I could use  45 caliber ammo  I could use that  It's very hard to come by these days  Yeah  Yeah yeah  I think the government's buying it all up  Really  That seems to be the conspiracy  Going around  Is that available in hollow point?  Yeah I actually prefer hollow point ammo 
[01:51:00]  Not at the range  For range ammo  You know  The cheaper the better  But for that home protection  And carry ammo  I do like a good hollow point  It keeps any of those  Poor pain in the ass  Innocent bystanders  From getting a little on them  I like that a lot  Yeah yeah  Something like that  So for something 45  I got plenty of 9mm  Maybe  Maybe 223 also  You know  I was just thinking  The life of a comedian is strange 
[01:51:30]  We just talked to Kevin Pollack  Days ago  And he was in France  In front of big huge monster yachts  And now he's in Philly  Going to a medical museum  Well you gotta understand  France and Philadelphia PA  Are sister cities  Oh they are  Oh yeah  You gotta  They do a little exchange program  Do they?  They do  Yeah  They exchange  Small somewhat talented Jews  During the spring and summer  Nice  Sure  Very strange 
[01:52:00]  I would assume  You're sold out down there  No?  Well according to your fans  On Twitter  I did the press here  Yesterday morning  And then they started  Yelling at me  What the fuck  On Twitter  What the fuck  You doing  We love ONA  Here in Philly  What are you doing  This local crap  Oh man  Really?  Yeah  Yeah  That's always nice  Yeah  And then you know  How you gotta answer them  It's okay  I'm sorry  You know  The second you go like  Hey  You know  Fuck off 
[01:52:30]  Then they all attack you  The same hand  That was like  Giving you kisses  Is now biting your hand off  Yeah  We're very confused  By our fans  I don't even know  If they're fans of ours  I don't know what they are  It's really fucking scary  Out there  They're a burden  Hey  The Muter Museum  Is on Twitter too  Oh it is  They go as  M-U-T-T-E-R  Museum  One word there  Muter Museum  On Twitter  Do they show any  Of their pictures  Sam  Of some of their cool shit  Not that I've seen yet  Not that  Well that's dumb 
[01:53:00]  A lot of horrible spines  In that museum  Weird stuff  A lot of spines  That just are  Not correct  No  I want to see  I want to see horrible spines  Now another thing  I need to correct  Hold on one sec  Hold on one sec  Alright  Sorry  Where do you get  Your medical advice  Probably from somebody  In a white lab coat  Standing in a hospital  Most of us do  But in recent years  Non-Western medical philosophies  Have taken home  Northern  And people seek  Other answers  Here's a good example  This is a 19th century  Chinese mannequin 
[01:53:30]  Designed to illustrate  A very different  God  They're not  They're not selling  Themselves properly  No they're not  We found a quick video  Of the Muter Museum  And it's a bore fest  Do the same thing  It's three centuries old  Nah whatever  Alright  Tears how to shove a baby  Down a fucking sewer pipe  I guess  Right  You got any comedy about that  This weekend  Kevin Paul  I'm going to cobble out  A couple of sweet bits  About it  Cobble out  Yeah yeah 
[01:54:00]  That's material  Ripe for the picking  Right there  But here's  I'm going to do it  Just as Christopher Walken  Of course  Of course  They found a baby  Apparently in a toilet  And how is this news  That's my question  I assume foolishly  This was a daily occurrence  In most parts of the nation  You know  Sometimes you just gotta  You gotta poop one out  I'm gonna continue cobbling  I think  Let me ask you this 
[01:54:30]  Yes  They also yelled at me  On Twitter  That I didn't give a shout out  To your guys' new podcast  Now I've proven myself  To be a listener of the show  And yet now  I missed the last  Several weeks' discussion  Right  About the new podcast  Please inform  Well you should tweet this  I'm so excited  That my pals  Open Anthony  Are finally in the podcast world  Congratulations guys  And so what is  The crumb cake  Is on the way  When's the launch  It already launched  We're up to episode three  You can get it on iTunes

[02:08:30]  It explains why  You see an outfit  Send us a video  Hmm  Alright  Straight ahead  Things not looking so good  Who's up top  NKOTB  That's yeah  That's New Kids  Yeah  And Donnie Don with them  Oh yeah  It's NKOTB  Alright  I wasn't sure if  Oh yeah  Donnie Wahlberg  Was part of the  Boston Strong  See what they sound like  Yeah  Oh oh oh  Alright  Oh oh oh  Oh boy  NKOTB  Oh oh oh 
[02:09:00]  Oh oh oh  Oh oh oh  This is the intro song  To their cartoon  Remember the New Kids cartoon  Yes  Fucking ruled  Say what  Oh oh oh  What you got  Are they as big as  They used to be  Oh my god  Donnie Wahlberg's like  What happened  Everyone was giving me  Accolades for my  Scene in Sixth Sense  A few other movies  Now I'm back on stage  Singing the right stuff  For these fucking clowns  Mark Wahlberg

[02:10:00]  They all spun at the end  And he kind of leaned over  Like he was  He's tired from the  Boston concert last night  I think that's it  Yeah it was up there  Problem is like  Sirius XM gives out signs  Of these things  Yeah  They print them out  And they got the  Sirius XM logo  So when they're panning  The front of the crowd  It says Sirius XM  And then it says  I heart NKOTB on it  Uh huh  I guess they must  Reuse the signs  Because the back says  Uh boys to men on it  Yeah I saw that  So when you're filming 
[02:10:30]  From behind  It just says  Sirius XM  Boys to men  And right as they went  To break they were  Doing the zoom away  From the crowd  And the stage  And all those signs  Say Sirius XM  I love boys to men  Boys to men  Why are they  Recycling signs  Sirius XM is like  Somebody  Aren't they that  Satellite radio company  You know they realize  It's AKOTB  What what  But it's a good idea  Why would they  Recycle signs  How expensive  Is fucking  Very expensive  It's a half a million dollars  And they're not  Getting them back  It's not like 
[02:11:00]  You know these  Fat girls who hold  The signs are gonna  Pass them back  Yeah it does look  A little like  Who is that though  Is it Jay Giles  Was it Jay  Yeah it is  I saw him bald  Years ago  Really  What's his name  What's his name  He's a good guy too  Jay Giles  Were you in the jacuzzi  And he was saying  Oh you've seen me  Without my hair  Behind the candle  Can I make you happy  Scott  Scott 
[02:11:30]  Make me happy  Oh Tom Papa said  That Michael would  Talk like that  Like when they were  In the background  Doing stuff  And something else  Was being filmed  He stayed in character  Oh really  Very funny yeah  Something Wolf  This guy's name is right  Oh Peter Wolf  Yeah of course  We were out in LA  The Hyatt on Sunset  I took a walk  To get a cup of coffee  Or something  And he was out there  Without his wig  And we flew out together  And there was a  There was a recognition  That I called  Without his fucking wig on  He is very bold 
[02:12:00]  What song is this  We can pull out your fucking  Your cell phone  And take a picture  Cell phone  This was before cell phones  I know  This is when we first started  I believe  Somewhere around there  It was a lot easier  For celebrities to go out  Like slobs back then  Right  It was only the paparazzi  Taking their pictures  Now everybody's the paparazzi  Who is the headliner  At Boston Strong  Gotta go with Steven Tyler  Right  I would think so  Or James Taylor  Steven Tyler  Over James Taylor  What's his name  Fucking Jimmy Buffet

[02:13:00]  Donnie Don  You started the rumor  Donnie Don  Seriously  That sucks  Well that's not a rumor  Donnie Don doesn't have  A stitch of hair  On his head either  We just decided to  Make something special  For this summer  And it's turned out amazing  No they didn't decide  To make something special  These bands  They can't do it  By themselves anymore  So they said  Let's get a super concert  Going and get all three  Bands together  And that'll get the tickets  Selling  I'll take the thoop  They didn't decide  To do something special  Fucking call me  You're incorrigible  You should move out 
[02:13:30]  Of incorrigible  Oh shit  They canceled the photo shoot  Yesterday to join us  In Boston  For the Boston Strong concert  And that just came  From the friendship  That we have together  I mean  I don't think they had  A friendship  When they were all competing  No  I don't think so either  Right  Who's that girl  She's cute  Which one  The blonde  The blue  Oh yeah  Sure she's fucking pretty man  Yeah who is she  I want to give her a smooch  On her cheek  Yeah  Oh on her cheek  I don't know  They're both kind of cute  I know they are  What do you smooch

[02:14:30]  Saying it  And talking about it  Two months ago  Unbelievable  Two months ago  We just  And we told everyone  We said look  This is gonna be a biggie  Took a while  Wow  Let's say hi to Mark  In Chicago  He saw the Boston  Strong concert online  Mark  Mark who was the headliner  I don't know  I think it was  Jimmy Buffet  But  Dane did a bunch  Of new material  Dane Cook  Sure  Yeah  And they did a live stream 
[02:15:00]  Of the broadcast  And his was blacked out  Because he didn't want  The live material  You know  Out on the air  Because of the stuff  That he's currently touring  With  Why didn't he do old stuff?  People want the new land  Yeah but  It's for a charity  So that  You know  People are gonna  Fucking kill him  For that  Yeah he's getting beat up  All over Twitter today  And the normal  Internet evidence  Because I guess  This streamed online  Which brought in 
[02:15:30]  A lot of donations  I'm sure  Oh man  He put himself  In a tough spot  Alright  Alright  Thank you Mark  Later fellas  Everybody  Alright then  Just waiting for the other  Guy to talk there  Okay  Okay  Okay  You guys are missing  98 Degrees  Oh this is 98 Degrees  Wow so it's  All these boy bands  See last summer  They did NKOTBSB  And they did 
[02:16:00]  New Kids and Backstreet Boys  On tour  Now  I guess they wanted  To do it again  But they didn't have  The BSB  And they said  98 Degrees  Is probably not gonna  Cut it by themselves  So now they're doing  NKOTB  98 Degrees  Boys to Men  Tour  Let's hear what this  Sounds like  To turn around  And walk away  Pretend I don't love  NKOTB  NKOTB  NKOTB  NKOTB  NKOTB  NKOTB  NKOTB  So you can get on  With your life  I just don't know this movie

[02:17:30]  It says three generations  Of fat women  Yes  Yes  I like the look  These guys got  Oh boy  They got their tuxedo ties  But they're not tied  You could see  When the three boy bands  Were next to each other  They obviously had to  Choreograph who got to  Wear which outfits  Uh huh  Cause they would always  Usually wear  You know similar stuff  Pretty much the same thing  What song is this?  Hardest thing I'll ever have to do  Oh  I don't know  There's a lot of people  There to see them though  Maybe the three of them  Is a big deal  I don't know  The three of them together  Four bands right? 
[02:18:00]  They'll  Three  They'll do just fine  Will they sell tickets?  Oh yeah  Yeah because  They put them all together  When were they big  In the 90's?  98 degrees?  Yeah  Yeah they were big  In like the late 90's  Okay  So it's not like  It's 30 years ago  New kids were early 90's  New kids were late 80's  Yeah  Late 80's for that  Yeah it was like  New kids were the late 80's  And then  Boys to men  Were like the early 90's  And then  Were the Backstreet Boys  Backstreet Boys  Are the same time  As 98 degrees  Late 90's  Why aren't they  On this tour?  Because they don't have to be 
[02:18:30]  Was NSYNC bigger?  NSYNC and the Backstreet Boys  Were the two biggest  I'd say NSYNC  Was Justin Timberlake  Which one was he in?  NSYNC  Will they get him  For a reunion tour?  No  I don't see that  Ever happening  I'm sure  Joey Fatone  And J.C. Chazet  Would love it  But  Ew  J.C. Chazet  But I don't think  I don't think  Justin Timberlake's interested  I don't think  J.T. needs to  Fucking hit the road  Why would he do that?  I think he's doing okay  With his solo ventures  You think the rest of the band 
[02:19:00]  Is just  Hanging out with Jay-Z  You think the rest of the band  Is just waiting  And waiting for him to drop  You know what  When he fucking falls  From his ivory tower  And wants to get back  With us on the road  Fuck that man  Fuck that  And I was like  Well maybe  You know  Alright well  We'll hear what he has to say  Right  He's never fucking  And then they go  You're finally done  With that side shit?

Oh yeah  Oh those things  And then that  You know  That guy  That creepy looking  Fat guy  Who used to put together  Boy bands  Found him  Oh right  Yeah  Lou Pearlman  I think  They all had to suck his dick 
[02:20:00]  Right?  Literally right  I think they all had to suck his dick  Literally  To get in the bands  I know the Menudo guy  I don't know for sure  But I heard  That they all had to suck his dick  Yeah  The Menudo guy  Made them do  Like things  What would he make him do?  I don't know  I think fucking  Shoved a little  Uncircumcised  Peckers in his mouth  Oh really?  Yeah I think so  Lance Bass is doing alright though  He's got a show right here  On Sirius XM  Yuck  Broadcasting icon  Lance Bass  How much are they paying him 
[02:20:30]  For that horse shit?  They're giving him a  He's doing a daily show  So it's a nice amount  Why?  What does he talk about?  You know  Gay lifestyles  And pop music  Yeah  He is a queeb  And a quay  Yeah I think he's more of a quay  He's more of a quay  Oh boys to men  This is where it gets good  Alright let's hear boys to men  Yeah  We know  I like the opposite  What's the name of the group y'all?  What's the name of the group y'all?  I imagine if they just went into  Hardcore gangsta rap  What's the name? 
[02:21:00]  Is it  Is it  What's your song?  Motown Philly  Come on  Are they singing or not?  No  Not at the moment  No way  No  No way  Dude they're not singing  The deep baritone guy  That's in the band  Is not in the band anymore  Why?  He left  Why?  I don't know  He didn't want to embarrass himself  Arrested  Why would you say that?  Because  This song sucks though  This is a massive song 
[02:21:30]  Was it?  I don't know  I know it's terrible  Yeah  I don't recall this one  This is huge  Yeah  Boys to men  Was quite a phenomenon  You don't think they're actually singing?  No  No certainly not  No fucking way  Who would pay to watch this shit?  They're a lot of fans  That's a fucking housewife  What a horrible fucking song this is 
[02:22:00]  This is a big song  This is a really unpleasant auditory experience  You don't like it Jim?  No I really don't  It's good stuff  It's a good song  I'd rather listen to that fucking old lady  Prancercizing her firecrackers  That was a good one  I want her to  Prancercize  While Pesci shoots at her feet like a spider  Come on  Prancercize  How can you not like Motown Philly?  It fucking  Like it stinks 
[02:22:30]  Yeah  Well you want to hear a little info  On New Kids on the Block?  We go to Houston  How do we got info?  People in Houston love Jim Norton  Right Kevin?  Yes they do  I knew it  What's up?  And I will be in Austin for the bus trip  I'm making the trek  Planning it now  I don't know  Are we doing the bus trip?  Yeah  Is it on the calendar officially?  Yeah  Mid to late September  Okay  Alright  Go ahead Kevin  Back in 63  So my 36 year old wife  Requested tickets to New Kids on the Block 
[02:23:00]  Because we had a suite with my company  And I was granted the tickets  And then I was told that  Because of ticket sales  You know they put up the black curtains  To make the arena look smaller  Yeah  They're blacking out all the luxury suites  And everything above that  And moving the people that are in the suites  Down to the floor level  Because the ticket sales are so shitty  And that's why all the bands had to get together  Of course  To sell out these arenas  New Kids are not selling arenas by themselves anymore  No  Bunch of lip syncing garbage 
[02:23:30]  New Kids were so big though  Huge  They were massive  All these bands were  98 Degrees now  What about Lone Star?  Fuck Lone Star  At least they're singing  At least they're singing  I think  98 Degrees was singing  Yes they were  So is New Kids I think  I think New Kids was  That's pleasant 
[02:24:00]  Little Lone Star for ya  It's all about boys to men  Yeah  BVD  A lot of things going on  Out on the streets of Manhattan  Yeah man  Summer's here  It's amazing with the summer  I just love the drop off  Yeah  Like Fox News just can't get  The big names  No  Nope  They can't  I know there's a lot of  Lone Star fans out there  Yeah but  But if you're doing a show 
[02:24:30]  But are you a mixed 98.5 fan?  That could be an Opie and Anthony nugget  A nugget  We could play some of that stuff  Sure  Those are nuggets we could play  You're trying to attract an audience  To a show in New York though  Yeah  So you have to know  You know just because people  Will watch it  In parts of the country  When they turn on the TV  And see that there's nobody there  Compared to the Today Show  That has a city block  Why can't Fox get the big names?  I mean as much as we're beating them up  That's a draw  A draw for the Today Show 
[02:25:00]  Absolutely  To have New Kids on the Block  Backstreet Boys  They have to be  Politically  Or ideologically  Affiliated with the Fox News  Kind of  Oh really?  You're not going to get  Like a liberal  Fan  That's going to play  On Fox News  It's empty there  There's no one there  Well  No they got a few small  It's a small crowd  Yeah but they  I'm going to look out the window  They stopped to pan  Yeah yeah  They pan  Well they zoom out  I should say  They zoom out from the stage  And then all of a sudden  They drastically  Take a pic  Stop because they know  If they keep zooming  It's going to be a lot  Yeah there'll be no one there 
[02:25:30]  They also give out free food  Yeah I know  Yeah they got like  A barbecue thing set up  Today Show doesn't have to  Give out free food  No  You also  You have no idea  What the surface  That those people  At the Today Show  Are standing on  Yeah  And over at Fox News  You can see plenty of  AstroTurf  Lots of green  Yeah you know exactly  What they're standing on  Right  So you can see it  Amazing  They solicit tourists  And homeless people  Just to fill that area  With the free barbecue  Oh boy  Oh god  Not good  Alright  E-Rock  What are you doing

[02:36:00]  That's having sex  With a fucking dog  Oh it's a woman  Right  Yep  Wow  Yeah we'll get into that  After the break  There's something  Very  Turn on  Even sick shit  When a woman  Is involved  And does it  Like guys you just  Assume are gonna be  Sick fucking disgusting pigs  When a woman  Is doing like  Sick disgusting sexual shit  It's like wow  Cause you'd realize  How fucking  Horny she must be  I'll tell you  I'm not into animal sex at all  It does nothing  For me to watch it  But I've had a couple 
[02:36:30]  Of women tell me  That they get turned on  Thinking about dogs  Fucking them  Or being mounted  Fuck is that  And talking about it  With the women  Turn me on  Like watching the actual  Stuff wouldn't  No no  And it has nothing  To do with  The actual acts  I think it's gross  But the idea  That this woman  Goes to work  This woman has friends  Probably even a husband  Or a boyfriend  Or whatever it is  That doesn't know  And then she wants  To play with her  Fucking pussy  Watching a dog  Fuck a woman  Like it's so 
[02:37:00]  Guts and dirty  Imagine if her young children  Knew about that  But no  That's the beauty  Is nobody  I've had a couple of women  Tell me that they have  Fuck dogs  And I know that  She likes a good mounting  She likes that  Oh yeah  The one girl I drove crazy  Cause I'm like  I just want to watch you  Get mounted  And she loved that word  That she wanted to be  Mounted  Mounted  How'd it go Sam  Did it go well  Well  I guess her like  Manager person's here  What  Filming something  Who's manager  Nicole  She's a manager  Yeah  And 
[02:37:30]  They're filming  Yeah  And so  She used to do the 411  But then she asked  What the question was  Right before she got on the air  And I said  They want to know  Why you don't show  Your tits more  On United States of Hip Hop  Good for you Sam  And  Her manager advised her  To go in  After the break  Because she would like  She would like that  On the air  Addressed  She would like that addressed  Oh okay  Is her manager pretty  Sure  Do we have to keep it clean  Are they filming  Oh she's ugly  No I said tits 
[02:38:00]  While she was filming  What did you mean to say  Please repeat  It was supposed to be implied  I guess  By the  By Sam  Wait what was the question  I didn't hear  I said is her manager pretty  And Sam was silent  And I should have just shut up  I said oh she's ugly  I didn't hear the question  I didn't see her  Alright so we got that going on  Now we gotta get back to  Sherrod looks good by the way  Too on TV  Like Sherrod is  He's very  He's good in these situations  Back to mounting Jimmy  I didn't mean to interrupt you  Oh that's okay  We were just getting  The Nicole answer  I was just talking about  Dogfucking 
[02:38:30]  It wasn't like I was  Breaking new ground  On the program  But she got turned on by  Yeah  And there's something about that  Again about the dirtiness  Of the woman who likes it  That is sexy  And I think most people  Feel that way  That's why we don't get  As mad at school teachers  Because I think when women  Do stuff like with their students  It doesn't feel as predatory  It just feels dirty  No  Whereas when men are predators  Well let me ask you this  You think it's animal cruelty  I know that's a very  No  It depends on the size of the animal  If you're fucking a cow 
[02:39:00]  My hat comes off to you  You can keep an erection  Through all that  You're a better man than me  I'm more the dog mounting the woman  Is that animal  No  Not at all  I'm sure the animal groups  Would say it absolutely is  It's sick  You should be arrested  It's definitely sick  And charged with being a silly goose  Well charged with being a good egg  It's stupid to tease this story  Now that we're deep into it  Pictures reveal Marilyn teacher  Having sex with family dogs  Or dog  Marilyn teacher has been busted  For bestiality 
[02:39:30]  After sick footage emerged  Of her having sex  With her family's pet dog  Who cares  She's 45  A little overweight  Blonde hair  Allegedly  Well she's a lot overweight  Allegedly engaged in a variety  Of sexual acts  With the canine  Over a month long period  In August 2008  Oh she kept it secret  For five years  Now wait  Who found out  Well well  She was only arrested  Early this year  After child advocacy  What  I'm sorry  JCPenney pulled the ad  From the billboard  Oh god  They caved the  Hitler teapot  They had a good thing going 
[02:40:00]  And he still got the teapot though  Because all you have to do  Is tell the people  Look that wasn't our intention  Turn it sideways  Tough shit  It's nothing like them  Exactly  Maybe they felt it would hurt sales  Like Jews wouldn't buy  No it sold out  Oh did it  Everybody wants one of these dumb things now  What  Ah whatever  Oh here she is  Oh here comes Nicole  And her camera person  Come on in Nicole  Alright Nicole  No that's fine  Not at all  We haven't seen a camera in years  Come on in  Come in  This is Opie and Anthony  And Jim  We used to be famous  Hi  Are you really talking about my boobs again? 
[02:40:30]  No  Not in a bad way  In a very good way  I think you're hurting yourself  Yeah  Because they're tight  They're pushed  They're not tight  No but they're pushed on the show  You can't tell you have nice boobs  They taped down  What?  The jumper in my last outfit  Why would they tape your breasts down?  They were trying to make them like pushed up  But I don't know  Let some shit hang out  Alright  Just a little bit  You need to look sexy  You're the eye candy for this show  I guess so 
[02:41:00]  You are  You should wear like a transparent white top  Like the newscaster  In Natural Born Killers  I'm not going to do that  No bras  Jimmy I'm not going to do that  It would be great  You get so much press off that  I don't know  I think certain outfits  Like there's a dress they had me trying the other day  That I think is going to be  You got to make sure people know  You got big ones  I got some good outfits coming up for you guys  And a little more gams  A little more gams  A little more legs  Legs  Okay  And Ann suggests you wear Uggs  Uggs  You love my Uggs  Your favorite  He loves Uggs  I love a good Uggs  I love a good Ugg  He thinks it would be a great look for Jimmy 
[02:41:30]  But the big open toed shoe thing  You steer clear  You should wear like big mummy bandages  On your feet  Jimmy I'm not going to do that  Ski boots  Mummy  Mummy bandages  You guys really hate my feet  You really just  The internet now hates my feet  If you know that if you go to Google  If you put in Nicole  And something about the matchup  The first thing that comes up is my feet  No  Really  It's not cool  It's because of you guys  Prove it  I got to prove it  I don't believe that  Own it though  Just own it  Because I got to tell you  They're fucking disasters  I know  They're just giant talons 
[02:42:00]  Talons  They are talons  I don't know what happened  Do your mom or your dad have big feet  What is that  Shut up  I'm just wondering  He did well all the way down to the ankles though  I'll tell you  Right  And then he said  Ah this is good enough  Oh yeah  Your ass could use a little  Oh yeah  The ass could use a little  You don't like me  The ass more than it makes up for it  I don't really have an ass  She's got a good ass  Well meat would be nice  But  I think you've got a nice ass  You have a very beautiful face  And lovely legs  And very wonderful breath  What else  Come on  I have a nice smile  She usually has very nice breath  Nicole smells good 
[02:42:30]  Oh really  She's a good smelling person  Oh  My microphone just got me  First time with a microphone  I gotta go do my show  Oh that thing  Alright  Let's show off the booms a little more  Okay  Alright  Don't look at my feet  You're all  You're all getting buttoned up on that show  Okay I'm sorry  We don't like the button up thing  You should be on like a little stick  Shitting onto a newspaper  When I go into styling  I'm gonna be like  Oh and A  A little bit  Let a little shit hang out  Okay  Done  Say it exactly like that  Alright  Can you let a little shit hang out  Yeah  Bye Nicole  Alright  Come on 
[02:43:00]  It'd be great for the show  It would be  There she goes  Topless  Take it easy  Yep  Bye camera dude  Bye sir  Alright  Here it is  Wow  She  You don't like her ass  No  Well it doesn't exist  Well you've been into black chicks  It looks like her back is shitting  There's no  Yeah  It's not one of those terrible underslung asses  She has an ass like a forehead  Just looks like a forehead  But it's like a wrestling move was done on it  Like a big slit in it 
[02:43:30]  That's what her ass looks like  She has a lot going for her  Yeah  Her ass is not part of it  Wow  It's very flat  I do think Nicole has nice breath though  And I think she'd be fun to fool around with  Yeah  Like just fuck around a little bit  She'd be fun to make out with  And just grope  Like Nicole is  Nicole's a great girl to fucking make out with  And grope at a party in a corner  Cause she's just like a fucking probably  And I'm saying that you know  She probably locks those giant fucking long talons around you  Oh my god  I couldn't look at those fucking feet though  No one can  No one can 
[02:44:00]  That's why they call them Uggs  Like I like to grab a foot  Oh shit  You're right  I just had nothing there  He was disappointed in himself  I should have been  That's why it's hilarious  Did you grab a foot  Let me stand up  Go ahead  Stand up  I came to stall  And she's  44  Got another three more of you  Alright so you got the Maryland teacher  She's 45  Okay  You had a child advocacy center  Their officer searched her home  On an unrelated matter  And found the pictures and video 
[02:44:30]  Of the disgusting acts  So she was getting away with it  Does her husband know  Or was he like what  This broad  Who looks after special needs students  Was charged with unnatural  Or perverted sexual practice  Oh leave her alone  Big fat lady  Who works with retarded kids  And fucks the dog  How do you get arrested  For like letting the dog fuck you  I mean it's twisted  The dog calls  I understand  I think if you find the video  And the pictures  You gotta do something  If you're an officer  Why?  Yeah you're not there for that  You're not 
[02:45:00]  Oh yeah  Okay  I see where you're going  I can't say shit  What she wants to do  Big fatty  She could get 10 years in prison  And a thousand dollar fine  She's a good citizen  Just banging the dog  It's cute  Some laws are ridiculous  It's hilarious  You want the dog to fuck you  That's your business  That's the dog fucker  And they kept the dog in the household  The dog still with the family  She's out on $5,000 bond  That's legal to just fucking  Like take your dog to the vet 
[02:45:30]  And have your vet kill it  So what the fuck is wrong  With fucking him?

[02:48:30]  Exactly  Can't you swim without  You can swim like now, right?  Oh, I could  If I  I want to add more water  So that the skimmers are operating properly  When the water levels up to the skimmers and everything  I want the pool operating properly  So what I'm going to do  I'm going to go home  I'm going to take the fucking hose  And pour water into my goddamn pool  Nice  And then I want the pool guys to come  Plug up the bottom drains  Nice  And then we'll sit back  And enjoy the pool a little bit  And if the water stops leaking out  We know it's the bottom drains  Yay! 
[02:49:00]  Problem fucking solved  How do you replace the drains?  They have to dig that shit up  Or can they do the one thing?  Wait till next fucking fall  Or the Remy thing  Can they just do the Remy thing?  Or do they have to do the pipes too?  Well then they can find out where it's coming from  But it would probably be a pipe  There's certain things they can do with pipes though  They can actually put in a small pipe liner  That they snake through a pipe  Really?

[02:58:00]  The big hullabaloo  Is a big show  It's a 3D movie  It's called  The big hullabaloo  The big hullabaloo  When is Seth Rogen's movie out  This is the end  Probably  I mean he's coming in June 12th  So whatever Friday  Is closest to June 12th  Alright so we still got  A couple weeks  So that's two weeks away  Cause you still got  Fast and Furious  Hangover 3  Star Trek  Iron Man 3  Great Gatsby  No one is talking  About Hangover 3  No  No  Not at all  That's all  They're just not  Talking about it  It's just nothing 
[02:58:30]  Is it good or not  It's a wrap for that movie  It's the same thing  Enough  The same jokes  The same gags  I guess Now You See Me  Is the big movie  What's that  That's the one with  Michael Caine  And Morgan Freeman  Where they're magicians  And they rob a bank  Is that the one where  Morgan Freeman  Falls asleep on the news  That's exactly the one  See that clip  Yes I have  He nods right off  Who does Morgan Freeman play  I don't know

[02:59:30]  Is not doing well  A lot of splatter marks  As far as reviews go  That's too bad  Mariah Carey  And Nicki Minaj  Leaving American Idol  Which opens up seats  For the Courtney Love rumor  And Randy Jackson too  He left  There's a strong  Show is done  Joe Franklin reruns beat it  There's a strong  Courtney Love rumor though  That she's joining  American Idol  That's right  Or X Factor  I think X Factor  Personally  You do  Yeah  I think X Factor  Is more of a  Courtney Love type show 
[03:00:00]  Hmm  Yeah she's got that  X Factor  Oh boy  Yeah they  American Idol  It's  It's over  But you know  It surprises me  Every time I hear that  There's a new season  Of Survivor  Yeah  And Big Brother  Like Big Brother  Was the worst thing  Than Survivor  It was like the bad  Survivor thingy  I liked Big Brother  For a while  We all  Like when it was  A brand new idea  It was amazing  I think this is  It's last year  Really  How many years  Has that been on here  Big Brother 
[03:00:30]  Big Brother  Started when we were  At NAW  99, 2000  But Survivor  It's like  Oh the  Still does well too  He's bringing over  Does it?  I've not heard  One person  Talk about Survivor  Not even close to the  Rays they used to do  But enough that  They're very happy  CBS pushes it so hard  Yeah they're very happy  With that show still  Every show there's  Always ads for Survivor  Because I don't watch  Any network shows  Just don't watch them  Stupid fucking  Who was the Rupert guy  Was his name Rupert?  Pupkin  I think that was  The last Survivor  I actually watched 
[03:01:00]  I think  Last time I heard  Anything about Survivor  Johnny Fairplay  Was lying by his grandma  See remember that?  It was like season 3 though  A long time ago  Now he plays golf  And takes pictures  Of his daughter  Yeah  And Jeff Probst  Has his own fucking show  You like that show?  No not anymore  Well you know what?  Someone alert the fucking network  Because they're still playing him  Well he has a very natural  Showbiz name  The Jeff Probst Show  You want to get an R  And a B  A P  And S  And a T  In a row  And say it  Yes  Probst 
[03:01:30]  What are you going to do tomorrow?  Let's watch the Jeff Probst Show  It stops your mouth  Like a fist  Hey man  I can't talk right now  I'm going down to watch  The Jeff Probst Show  It really is awful  It's literally  It's like you're driving a car  And somebody drops a wall down  Right in front of you  Hey man  Come back in half hour  Watch the Jeff Probst Show  Probst  Fuck him anyway  It's a speed bump  Yeah  On the fucking highway of words  He had one of the most 
[03:02:00]  The show he had the other day  You're watching this thing  Well you know what happens  Which show you're watching?  Here's what happened  The Jeff Probst Show  Hey just tune in  Watch the Jeff Probst Show  Here's what happens  What happened  The lovely Ann Mareska  Keith's wife  She comes over  Is she a fan of the Jeff Probst Show?  No  But  She watches other shows  That channel is on 
[03:02:30]  The Jeff Probst Show  Right  So  So  She's watching those  When I'm here at work  And she's doing  Her stuff at the house  And then I get home  And  I nap and stuff  And then she leaves  But she knows to leave the TV on  Because I  You know  I'm going to watch TV  And that's on  So I come downstairs  I start looking at my phone  And the Jeff Probst Show  Is on  And  It's terrible  It's  It's terrible  There was  It was such a  He had  I guess  He brought a whole black family on 
[03:03:00]  That was poor  And just started giving them stuff  And it was so  Like  Degrading  And self-serving  And  And like  Look at me  I'm the guy that's giving you stuff  Just because they were black?  Yes  You could tell  What was their real problem?  He's trying to get black audience  Yes  What was their problem  That he picked this black family?  Well  I guess the  The mother  Had lost her job  Right  And there was the daughter  A son  Another kid  I don't know  I don't know 
[03:03:30]  And then they  They  They had a white couple  Come in  And this guy owned a business  And he gave the black woman a job  And then they had all these other people  Like  In the fashion  Was his name  Fucking Mr. Drummond?  That was Mr. Drummond  They had other white people  In fashion and stuff  And they were dressing them  But it was just like  Look at all the white people  Helping this  Poor black family  It was degrading to black  But you think  All the white people  After the show tape  Said okay  We just did that for TV  Oh yeah 
[03:04:00]  I think so  I don't think anyone really cares  I hate the theme song  For it too  I think the white guy  Is like  I don't really have to give her a job  Right  That was just for TV  Oh good  I could  Hive somebody else  Theme song's terrible  What's the theme song?  It's the Jeff Probe  Psst show  You're watching the Jeff Probe  Psst show  I have to find  What the Jeff Probe  Psst show  I want to see a moment  Of the Jeff Probe  Psst  Do you have that  Black family one now?

Oh god  Take a tour  Of Lisa Ling's home  Banal dreck  It really is  That should be the name  Of the show  Banal dreck  It's terrible  Are you addicted to shopping?  Oh god  No let's not play this clip  No I want to hear  Because I might be addicted  To shopping  Maybe this is a better clip  Sometimes I question myself  Alright  A better clip  Are you starting to  Are Bud Dwyer  The benevolent white people  Can you make it bigger Sam  So I can enjoy  I can't sit at home  The love of shopping 
[03:05:00]  That so many of us have  And sort of what we call  Shopping addiction  Going on with our eyes  Psycho eyes  Crazy eyes  Three main areas of your life  Money  People  And time  When you're putting your finances  In jeopardy  What she does with her eyes  Crazy eyes  Borrowing from people  Putting your family's finances  In jeopardy  We have a problem  When it's getting  Listen to her mouth  Dry mouth  Crazy eyes  A partner  Or a boyfriend  Or a girlfriend  Or a family member  Says what are you doing  And why are you spending  So much money  Or people are actually  Getting down  And upset about it  And finally time 
[03:05:30]  Are you spending  Tons of time  I'm a bug eyed idiot  Garfield get to it  The whites of her eyes  Are exposed  Completely around  The virus  Yeah  Alright where's Jeff  I don't want to see her  I don't want to see Jeff  I don't want to say  Why people aren't watching  This show  This is amazing  This is a backstage bonus  They call  If you're shopping  To watch  You're probably  Steady  To watch money  She's absolutely right  Wow good one  She's still talking  Shut up  Backstage boners  Yeah  Anyway  I want to hear Jeff Probst speak 
[03:06:00]  Where is he  They're showing everyone  But Jeff Probst  There he is  You're ready to say yes  To an adventure  Oh  And if you say yes  That's kind of cute  You're doing it  Regardless what it is  There is no  Tell me  Give me a hint  Nothing  Yes sir  Okay  Here's what's going to happen  I'm going to ass rape you  The whole fucking staff  Because  But you said  I believe in second chances as well  And I do believe that life  Is long  But at best  Very short  And you got to make the most of it  What  So  Here are some sides 
[03:06:30]  Words of wisdom  Lloyd  From a very popular show on NBC  Called Grimm  Prime time drama  Doesn't get bigger in television  Than prime time drama  That is the holy grail  Look at her look  Now this is from an episode  That they've already  I wonder if it's on  I wonder if it's on the same network  Grimm and the Jeff Probst show  Is she an actress who wants to do it?  Maybe  Take the script  Oh  Nah it's a set up  Now  Hold on  But she's got to act with Rich Voss 
[03:07:00]  Louie Bain  Lana is  The casting director  For Grimm  Oh boy  For Grimm  Okay  How many times  Do you get a chance to read  For the casting director  For a hit show?  We get it  We get the bit  I never heard of Grimm  Very rare  What you're going to do  Is you're going to go into  One of my rooms  In the back  Oh  If I knew you were to  Pussy with this zucchini  And then come back  And take a shit on the script  And I'll eat it  With the zucchini  Yeah I'll scoop up your shit  With the zucchini  And make myself a probe salad 
[03:07:30]  A probe salad  While you don't get the part  Reggie Lee  Come on out  She doesn't seem excited  Just stealing what we did  From fucking Chaz Palminteri  Yes  There you go  She doesn't look excited  She doesn't give a fuck  Grimm  What's up Reggie?  She probably hates Grimm  Grimm  Yeah  It's a show about a toast salesman  From Ron Conkoma  He sells toast  Door to door  Yeah  His name is Jerry Grimm  Whatever  But this show is more about  Saying yes to the adventures in life  You know what it's like  To be a budding actor 
[03:08:00]  You're trying to  Can we stop  No this is  This is the show  Dude Jeff Probst is getting to the bottom of it  Yes to life  To pursue this career  Uh yeah  And hopefully get more than just a leg  This set up should have been a minute  Star on NBC's Grimm  Reggie Lee  Never heard of him  No we're Grimm  I never heard of the show  I've never heard of  Cross Promoter  How great if he just sexually assaulted her in the back  And Jeff Probst was sued  And thrown off the air  Oh fantastic  Reggie Lee had a breakdown  It wasn't the most  Stabbing staffers 
[03:08:30]  But this is a  Typical Jeff Probst show  So  It's  It's feel good  When you say  Hey mom  Did you catch a show last night  How you feeling about my heart  They are my biggest fans  I just have to  I just have to say that  They are incredibly supportive  Incredibly supportive  But you know  It was about  Getting to acting class  And trying to sing  And trying to dance  And doing all that stuff  Oh my  No one cares about you  And your juicy lips  No one cares about this guy  This is huge  Only because there are  I have friends now struggling  That are just struggling 
[03:09:00]  To get an agent  Nicole looks like one of the wayouts  From the Flintstones  Not enjoying this segment at all  This segment is hideous  It's awful  They're trying to make something  I want to see her act  Let's do it  We've got a nice room backstage  They're still setting up the bed  Terrible  Because Lana  You don't always have long right  No just a few minutes  Okay  She's like  How did I get roped into this  Exactly  You have the cabinet  The network wanted to cross promote  And I got to get involved  Believe me  Lana has nothing else to do  There's obviously another angle here  Right  What do you mean  She's going to read lines  That are actually like 
[03:09:30]  Anything  For something else  No  They're just going to do  A straight read  Oh yeah  Oh my god  I hope she's  God I hope she's  Terrible  Here it goes  Here's the only thing I ask  None of this is  Content  If you just come out here  And say  Oh I'll give her a shot  Because I'm on a TV show  That doesn't help her  She's trying to figure out  What  She's still setting it up  Dude  More  More stuff  It is  Terrible  I have no influence  How about she doesn't have  The look of an actress  Exactly  What do you want  I want to see her  Connecting with  I want to see her sing 
[03:10:00]  Rock and roll high school  That would be great  Making eye contact with him  Oh god  I want to see her act  Whatever she's worked on  I want to see her act  Alright  When you guys are ready  Okay here we go  Why do the Mellifers  Want you dead  You're a detective  Figure it out  Oh  I can't help you  Unless you tell me  Why Melissa Wincroft  Wants you dead  Melissa Wincroft  You have no idea  What you're getting  In the middle of  If anything happens to me  It won't be just  A Grim  Killing a Hexen beast  It'll be a cop 
[03:10:30]  Who fails to protect  An innocent woman  From dying on his watch  It's up to you  Oh god she's so bad  Wow she's also  Here's my take  She's also cold reading  In front of a fucking audience  It's very clear  Why Reggie is a star  On the show  And you're very good  The question is  Is Nicole good enough  To get a spot  Don't give it away  How do you feel right now  Don't give it away 
[03:11:00]  I feel pretty good about it  Okay so  We're going to take a quick break  Oh I don't  But I have to know  If she got the part  On the Grim show  On the Grim show  It's a marvelous program  For the moment  And here  The Grim and the Hexen beast  She isn't even like  Being given a chance  To be on the show  It's  Are you even good enough  To be on it  If she's like  Yeah she's good enough  To be on it  She's not going to be  She should have talked  Like fucking  Klugman Quincy  We have a big decision  About to be made  Oh  Joining us  Nicole  Don't give it away 
[03:11:30]  Let's tease it more  We put firecrackers  In Nicole's vagina  The question now  Is how did she do  I was actually  Pleasantly surprised  That she was  More engaged  Than I expected her to be  Which means  The situation that we're in  And I thought  She definitely was  Trying to get something  And pursuing that  It was a little bit  On one level  So I think  If I had a little time 
[03:12:00]  To work with her  Comes across the footlight  Instructed her to try  A couple different tactics  To get what she wants  But overall  Oh is that that candy  Game  Oh yeah  To say it was good  Okay so  That smile  The question is  That's good right  Because as Reggie said  You know I got buddies  Trying to make dreams  Come true  You can't even get an agent  Let alone get an audition  You got the whole  Ball of wax here  Would you bring her  Into your office  For a legitimate audition  For a part on Grimm  No  No  Yes 
[03:12:30]  You know I think  Everybody deserves  A second chance  And  Because she did so well  In just this  Really brief  That's good  It's a feel good show  Jeff Proops  That is what happens  When you say yes  To adventure  Maybe one day  On Grimm  Very nice  On Friday night  We'll see Nicole  I don't think so  That was so bad  That is  That was fucking excellent  You liked it?  Yes I did  Oh you're tearing up Chip  Fuck yeah  Nicole got a shot  To be on the 
[03:13:00]  Jeff Proops  Show  No she got a shot  To be on Grimm  By being on the  Jeff Probst  Show  Fucking Jeff Probst  Rules  No he doesn't  He's the fucking best  If Chip likes him  I love Jeff Probst  Yeah  What happened?  What happened?  That was horrible TV  It was terrible  Jeff Probst is fucking great  Of course they're gonna give it to her  Big thing  They gave her a chance  To audition again  She'll get it  Cause they're not gonna humiliate anyone  On a show with that  And it's not like 
[03:13:30]  We're gonna give you a part  We're gonna give you a chance  To  She'll be starring in the show  You mocked my words  Yeah she's not  Oh sorry  She's fucking good  No she's not  Jeff Probst wouldn't do it  If it didn't work  Oh Chiperson  That's how we end  A good week of radio  With that horse shit  I think that's the best way  To end  The Jeff Probst show  Fuck  I could watch that for hours  You probably could  Fuck yeah  I'd tape them all  Jesus  No one's telling him 
[03:14:00]  That his setup was really long  No one told him anything  Cause his show's cancelled  Right  But they keep playing it  Is it cancelled?  Yeah yeah  I guess they have some in the can  Oh sure  Yeah  They're just throwing them out there  In the can  They don't have anything to replace it  Oh I guess there's another  At the moment  So they just continue to run  It's terrible  Well alright  Now we forge into the weekend  Don't we?  Yes we do  Headlong  Yes we do  Face into the wind 
[03:14:30]  Let's fucking  Get the fuck out of here  Get another weekend started  Well I have a plug  Alright  I wish I had one  In the bottom of my pool  Three minutes  Tickets for July 20th  Myself, Amy, Artie  It's a short show  David Tell  Go on sale  In three minutes  Saturday, July 20th  Bethlehem, PA  The Sands Casino  Resort  And I have a video  To work on  Oh  Let me just start  Let's watch 
[03:15:00]  The Jeff Probst Show  The O.P. and Anthony  Show is available  Later today  With Sirius XM  On Demand  You've heard about it  You've waited  Four  Long  Hours  For it  Finally  The moment is at hand  After O.P. and Anthony's  Life is coming up  Next  Here he is 
[03:15:30]  For After O.P. and Anthony  Live  Call up  866-WOW1-WOW  We can do an  Old-fashioned game  Of what did you learn  On today's  O.P. and Anthony show  Here  On After O.P. and Anthony 
[03:16:00]  Live  Good show today  Heard from  Friend of the show  Kevin Pollack  Announced  Crow Nuts  To the world  I hope that  Nicole took their  Advice  And brought  Crow Nuts  To the morning mashup  Because any radio show  That is not talking  About Crow Nuts today  Does not know  What they're doing  Iraq are you  Do the Crow Nuts  Appeal to you  I know you  People have  Misconceptions about Eric  Because 
[03:16:30]  You know  Your weight  And consumption  Gets spoken about  So frequently  They don't realize  That you are also  You're specific  About what you like  Yeah I don't eat  The junk stuff  But I thought  You were going to say  Did Nicole take  Their advice  About showing her  Tits more  On United States  Of hip hop  Well I don't think  We've had time  To do it  The only time  Will tell  As far as that's  Concern  We'll find out  On Tuesday  Nicole's show  Is on every  Tuesday night  On Fuse  But  And I would think  That if they want  Anybody watching  That show  Nicole should  Take Opie and 
[03:17:00]  Anthony's advice  I mean it's a good show  I watch it every week  But  What if she starts  Wearing those outfits  Like Coco does  Ice T's wife  Like Thong Thursdays  Yeah  Then you get  People watching  If she just started  Coming out  And doing Thong Thursdays  Although  You know  Coco is highlighting  A certain part  Of her anatomy  That Nicole  Probably can't compete with  Well they're very  Skimpy outfits  That's true  I mean either way  I would love to see  Nicole in one of those  Coco outfits  Maybe she can wear them  While she's sitting down  Right  Right  And just display 
[03:17:30]  Everything else  No but do you like  The  Are you a cronuts guy  Is that something  That appeals to you  I only knew of it  Because Roland's been  Talking about it  For the last two weeks  In the office  But if we had him in  I would definitely try it  I don't know if it'd be  A favorite of mine  But I would try it  Do you like donuts  Do you like croissant  No I'm not a croissant fan  At all  Why is that  I don't know  It's too flaky  Okay  Like the really good ones  Are very flaky  And I don't like that  I understand  I understand  But I would try it  I'm willing to try it 
[03:18:00]  Let's start with the phones  With 501  What's up Sam  How are you doing buddy  Hey  What did you learn today  I learned that Nicole  Has bread in her pants  Yeah  We found out from Nicole  That Kenny was giving  Her advice  To not wear underwear  So she doesn't get  The bread thing  In her underwear  Which I think  Is inappropriate  It's very inappropriate  It sounds like an HR issue  Sounds like harassment  I guess Nicole took it  With a grain of salt  I believe he was referring  To a yeast infection  By the way 
[03:18:30]  I did want to say  I learned today  That Opie and Anthony  Cannot book Michelle Beadle  Day of  On the show  However  I don't know if the rest of you  Know about this yet  But this Sunday  At 4pm Eastern  Guess who my guest will be  On the Sam Roberts show  Jeffrey Tambor  Incorrect  That was a good guess  But totally wrong  Michelle Beadle  Wow  The reunion  Yeah  My second interview  With Michelle Beadle  Goes down on Sunday  She's very nice  She's the best  And it's not a 
[03:19:00]  It's not a replay  Of when she was on  On the after show  During Wrestlemania week  She came in  It's a brand new interview  You're going to talk about  Sitting next to her  During the Hall of Fame  Yeah yeah yeah  With Michelle Beadle  Michelle Beadle is a friend of mine now  We were sitting next to each other  At the Hall of Fame  Boy what a celebrity road that was  We went to the WWE Hall of Fame  It was me and Eric  It was very unexpected  Right because we  We just ended up  A buddy of mine  Gave us these seats  Out of nowhere  Like while we were at the show  On the floor  Just behind the reserve section  For celebrities 
[03:19:30]  And WWE people  And I couldn't tell  If Eric and me  Brought the celebrity quotient  Down or up  Because this row  It was me  And E-Rock  Yeah  And then it was  Peter Rosenberg  From Hot 97  Who's done my show  On Sunday  That brings it up  Yeah  Or do we bring him up  I think he brought us up  No fucking way  Maybe in New York  But not outside this city  Get the fuck out of here  Nobody  Who's listening to Hot 97  Outside of New York  I don't know  He was on United States of Hip Hop  Yeah for like five minutes 
[03:20:00]  He's a big deal I guess  No he's not  Oh okay  Maybe in New York he is  I was misunderstood  But not outside of New York  Come on  Get out of here  But  So yeah  And he's done the Sunday show before  To bring him  Familiar with the audience  Then next to him  We had Michelle Beadle  Next to her  Judah Friedlander  It was that whole little  And I don't know  Maybe  WWE was having trouble  Drawing star power  For  For the Hall of Fame ceremony  Because that apparently was  The VIP section 
[03:20:30]  They were all sitting in the  All the star power  Sitting in that section  In front of us  So Michelle Beadle  Was just sitting there like  Really I get stuck in Radio Row  With these schlubs  Well I think that's also  Why she didn't stay long  Yeah no  She's like I'm going backstage  I'm out of here  Bye  Goodbye  Goodbye E-Rock  Goodbye Sam  But yeah  You know what we will talk about  Pissing in adult diapers  She did that  Did she admit to that  Yes  Michelle Beadle  Peeed in an adult diaper  She tried it out  You'll find out on Sunday 
[03:21:00]  The show's on at 4pm  Eastern time  I like how Ope tried  When we were talking about  Getting her on the show  Ope resorted to  Is yelling at the door  Even though the door  Wasn't open  Going  Yo Michelle Beadle  She's not even here  She's not going to hear you  That's not going to get her in  You know who else  Is on the Sunday show  This week  Jeffrey Tambor  No not Jeffrey Tambor  He did every show  Except mine  Oh  No  Chloe Kardashian  Yes  She looked alright  Oh did she look alright 
[03:21:30]  She looks fantastic  I don't know if it's that  She takes photos  Around her sisters  And that's a bad idea  But let me tell you  When Chloe Kardashian  Was up here  She was up here like  Yesterday in the afternoon  When she was up here  She looked fantastic  Unbelievable  I think  She looks like she had  Some stuff done to her  Well I don't know  Because her face  Still looks a little whatever  And Troy was saying  He thinks she had  A rib removed  I don't know if she had  A rib removed  She might have gotten  A tummy tuck or something  Troy tends to be  A little dramatic  With these things  He said girls will do that 
[03:22:00]  Now that y'all have  Their ribs removed  That's because that's  What Troy wants to do  Troy wants to have  A rib removed  I don't think she had  A rib removed  But  She was  And I  She was very  She was looking skinny  But she kept her curves  Which was looking good  Let me go to  Area code 508  You're on after  Opie and Anthony live  Hey there Sam  Today I learned  That a single cronet  Will go for the price  Of a gallon of gas  During a hurricane  That's right  Why are people paying  Upwards of  20, 30, 40 dollars 
[03:22:30]  For one cronet  It's a combination  Croissant and donut  And apparently  This is all the rage  Here in New York  There's one shop  That does them right  It's like a local bakery  And the store opens  At 8 o'clock  People line up  At like 5 in the morning  To buy these things  They limit them  They only do  200 a day  Which is smart  Because that's why  People talk about it  And they're sold out  By 8, 10  They go through  All of them  Do you think that guy  That's always first  On the iPhone line  Was first 
[03:23:00]  Of course  He's there every day  What's his name  Jeff  I forgot his name  I don't remember  But I always see him  He's always on Fox 5  And CNN  And he's never  The most compelling  Person online  He's always the first  Person online  And he's always  Boring to talk to  He's always disappointing  You've got to  Go deep on the line  Before you can find out  Who you really need to find  The other thing  That's going on  On Sunday  I want everybody  To remember  If you're in town  Mick Foley  At Caroline's  Is this Sunday  Remember last week  He was in to promote it  This Sunday  He'll be at Caroline's 
[03:23:30]  210  You're on  After Open Anthony Live  Hey Sam  Congratulations  On getting off  Of level 29  Thank you Lady Trucker  That's a big update  Of my life  How's this sound  Candy Crush  Level 35  That's right  Not only did I get  Past level 29  But I started  Jamming past levels  Now I know  What people were  Talking about  We've been talking  About Candy Crush  A lot lately  And I get past  Level 35  To get to level 36  You either have to 
[03:24:00]  Pay 99 cents  Or ask somebody  On Facebook  You need tickets  To allow you  To get to level 36  It's Robert  It's carny bullshit  Is what it is  I got you all  Excited about it  Now Eric's playing  And he's doing the  I was playing it  Before you were  No I mean  Playing it on the air now  Oh yeah  Apparently that's  The rule of thumb  Around here now  It's carny  Nonsense  That game  I saw some of  The harder levels  Later on  It might get to a point  Where I can't play 
[03:24:30]  This game anymore  Yeah I'm ready  To figure out  What I'm going to  Throw in the towel  Because once it  Gets too carny  It's like  I'm not interested  I'm not interested  As it is  But it's very addictive  When you get to the point  That you're sitting there  And going  Maybe I'm going to  Buy one of these  Little trinkets  Right  To beat the board  Right  Then that's going to  Be a big problem  Because you're going to  Start wasting a lot of money  Right  And I don't have  That money to waste  617  You're on After  Open Anthony Live  Sammy Sweetheart  Professional broadcaster  How are you buddy  That's right  What's up buddy  Hey

[03:26:00]  A gazillion Facebook people  You just ask them  To give you a ticket  I know but I  I don't like having  All the Facebook people  And then there's one guy  He works here  He's off the air  But he  Larry  He brags  About all the lives he has  He's like oh yeah  I never run out of lives  Because I have 150 lives  On Facebook  And then I get a Facebook  Request from him  Asking me for a life  I'm like fuck you dude  You're not gonna walk around  Bragging about lives  And then try to get one from me 
[03:26:30]  No  The answer is no  He's at the point now  Where if you look at the map  On his phone  It has an under construction sign  Because he beat every level  I don't look at anything  On that guy's phone  He's like a 350 something  Well I mean  What freaks me out too  Is that every time  I play the game  It's like  Send your friends lives  And I'm like  Are these people  Like you know  Do they think I'm  Some kind of psycho  Because I'm constantly  Sending them lives  Yeah  I'm not saying  I mean  Nicole is  Nicole is talking  At me through the glass  I'm trying to

[03:27:30]  What's up buddy  I learned that  Even when you're  An eccentric  Multi-millionaire  You still can't  Find people  To fix your shit  Right the first time  You can't  Ant is having  Such problems  With his pool  I feel bad for him  He's got the world  At his fingertips  He's got everything  He's ever dreamed of  He's got the house  He plays by his own rules  He's got a velociraptor  In his backyard  It's finally  90 degrees outside 
[03:28:00]  And that silly Italian  Cannot go in his pool  He can't get it done  Do we have the  Interns around?  Yeah  They're in here  Screaming calls  Can we meet the new interns?  Tyler go in  We'll meet Tyler first  One at a time?  You're the boss  He's finishing  Screaming your calls  Oh okay  Alright  Alright  Drew in Louisiana  Hey buddy  How are you doing?  When you were stuck  On 28 or 29  I called 
[03:28:30]  A week or two  Ago  And told you  You get fucking  Stuck on 35  But I'm not  35  Believe it or not  I got lucky  Because I've tried  To do the level again  And I haven't been able  To do it  I finished 35  In one shot  I got lucky  But now I just  Can't get to the next level  Because nobody  Because nobody  Will invite me  Oh I didn't know that  See I'm still on 35  I've been on it  For fucking  Two months  It's all about  That's the carny  Bullshit of this game  Is that it's just luck  And you can tell that  Because sometimes  You're playing this  Stupid game 
[03:29:00]  And it says  Well there's no more  Matches you can  Possibly make  Well guess what  Maybe you should have  Given me some matches  This is obviously fixed  Oh yeah  And like you said  Never trust  Never trust the flashers  Never trust what  They tell you to do  No no  They give you tips  And they're the worst  Possible tips ever  All they do  Is they clear like  One little thing  And then they make it  So you can't do  Anything else  It's a carny  It's just as silly  It's like trying to throw  It's like that guy  Who's all he wanted to do 
[03:29:30]  Was win his money back  But what does he  Go home with  His life savings gone  And a banana  With Rastafari  In braids  You know  Because he thinks  That he can throw  That ball into the  Tupperware  Guess what  It's going to bounce  Out every time  It's the same thing  As this bullshit  They're like  Look how easy it is  Look  You can match up  Yeah exactly  You can match up  The three banana candies  It's so easy  What they don't tell you  Is match up  Those three banana candies  And let me see you  Try to match up  Some oranges after that  It's not going to happen  Let me tell you 
[03:30:00]  What I learned today  What'd you learn  Y'all have a new  Hot ass  Itch and turn  Screening calls  How do you know  She's a hot ass bitch  There is a female  Screening calls  But I believe  Until there's any reason  To do otherwise  We will all treat her  With some respect  Hot ass bitch intern  Well I have the other  Intern in here now  It's new intern day  We lost  Alan Thicke Jr  I don't think we really  Lost  He's not here anymore 
[03:30:30]  You remember  Alan Thicke Jr  He was the intern  Who on his last day  Of his internship  Announced to us  That when he was a child  He was fat  And had no eyebrows  Until he was about 13  And so we as a show  Decided  To shave his eyebrows  To psychologically  Kind of get him back  Into that space  Where he wanted to  Kill everybody around him  Because as far as we could see  He's not coming back here  It's not like it's going  To affect us  He might go and be angry  To somebody else  But we're taking his  Building ID at the end 
[03:31:00]  Of the day  But it is  It's new intern week  Your name is Tyler  Correct?  That is correct  And Tyler knew  Intern Alan Thicke  Is he dead?  I hope not  He always said I hope  And he realized  You're a bad person  Because you're the intern boss  And you have to  You have to show  Some kind of  Professional decorum  Me on the other hand  They took it away from me  Always breaking the wall down  Sam  Did you know that Tyler?  I used to have a much bigger say  In who we hired as interns 
[03:31:30]  Oh yeah?  That's right  I probably would never  Have gotten this job  I don't think so  Because it seems like  Based on appearance  It looks like you have  Your shit together  Oh man  And if you came into  An interview  With me  When I was in the  Interviewing process  If an intern came in  And they were like  Yeah I kind of have  My shit together  I'm doing well in school  My shirt's tucked in  I'm wearing a tie  All strikes against you  In my book  I should have never  Worn a tie  I've gotten more crap  For a tie  Than I ever thought  I would  On my first day of work  You came in  I was trying to make my mom proud 
[03:32:00]  And like all that good stuff  Yeah  Nope  Nope  Tyler the new intern  He came in  He had a tie on  He looked professional  You know  This place needs  A little professionalism  He was under the impression  That there's  Work being done here  And so he wanted  To look the part  He thought there were  People to impress here  Now  Just showing up  Will impress him  I can't believe  That guy's been here  Like every day  He said he was going to be here  He has gone above and beyond  Perfect attendance so far  So you're  How many days a week  Do you work?  Four days a week  You're interning 
[03:32:30]  Four days a week  Where do you come from?  Philadelphia  Do you live in Philadelphia?  I went to school at Temple  Like I'm still a student at Temple  And I was living there  While I was going to school there  But I was like  Born and raised  In the suburbs of Philadelphia  Do you live there now?  Like while you're  Or are you staying in the city?  Yeah I'm staying in the city  I'm living at NYU housing  For the summer  Because we had an intern once  That's smart  They just open their houses to people?  Yeah like the dorms  It's like a crappy  Like freshman dorm  That has no air conditioning  And I'm in a triple room  And that's how I'm living all summer  You're in a crappy  Crappy quote unquote 
[03:33:00]  He's in the village  I know  It's like  You realize that people pay for  It's nicer than most apartments there  Yeah no it's a dream  Yeah  So how does that work?  You don't go to NYU?  No yeah  No not at all  So do you just say  Hey I'll rent your dorm room?  Yeah no that's it  Apparently there's people  That like aren't even student age  Like you have to have an internship  Or some sort of college thing going  But there's like a married couple  On one of the floors  I'm pretty sure  And stuff  And like it's  Yeah it's weird  So you just get like  If you get the wife  That has a decent job  You get the husband 
[03:33:30]  To just get some schlubby internship  Yeah  And then you  And then you get the  She gets to live in the village  And it's not expensive?  No it's like  I think it's  $3,300 for the whole summer  For three months?  Yeah  $1,100 a month  You should consider just getting it  I know  I'm going  Right now  I'm going to see if they will demote me  Back to intern  Here  But Eric's got to be your boss then  Look  Technically he still is my superior right?  Whatever position I'm in  I'll run circles around him  And that's no offense to you Eric  That's none 
[03:34:00]  I hope none taken  Oh  No not at all  Okay good  Good  Good  Excellent  Yeah  Because I don't know where you guys are in the country  But in the city  $1,100 a month  Buys you nothing  Like you won't  You might buy a garbage can for your apartment  For $1,100  That doesn't even get you one roommate in the apartment  Yeah  That's maybe multiple roommates  And not even in Harlem  Harlem is more expensive than that  If you're in a one bedroom with a roommate  You will be paying more than $1,100 
[03:34:30]  Absolutely  And you get this sweet ass dorm room  Living the dream  And the village is a really cool area  It's young  Yeah  Jars  Fucking some of the best food in the world is there  You know  So you're having a blast  I'm trying to  And you get to live in this dorm room  And you don't have to go to any classes  I mean I gotta be here  And I'm taking classes on Saturdays  I guess  Alright  I mean still  You drinking your face off?  Trying to  It's hard  4.30 in the morning is rough  Good for you  Yeah  Eric actually called me  Or texted us  The day before our first day  I was at a concert  My friend's concert at Webster Hall  At 9.30 
[03:35:00]  Your friend plays Webster Hall  Is it like  It was a studio at Webster Hall  I didn't mean to upsell it  But it's radio  That's not gonna fly with me  I keep it honest  Yeah  Alright  Good to know  You know what people say about  After opening Anthony live?  No  That's Sam Roberts  He keeps it 100  They learn that from DJ  Your trill  Keep it trill  That's exactly right  There we go  So you got a text from Eric  Yeah  Got a text from Eric at like 9.30  It was like  Hey we'll see you at 5.30 tomorrow  And that was right after our orientation  Bonnie who like is the head of all the interns at Sirius 
[03:35:30]  Had told us that we weren't gonna be starting until June 4th  So I was under the impression  That I could like go wild at this show  And like I literally just started my tab  And I get a text from Eric  And it's like  Hey we'll see you at 5.30 tomorrow  And I have to be like totally honest  And I knew you guys played pranks on the interns and stuff  And for a second I thought it was like  That seems wholly inappropriate though  To tell the interns  That's a whole new level to prank them before they even start here  I thought it was like some psychological warfare  Where I was gonna show up  And like no one's gonna be here  And like they wouldn't let me in the building 
[03:36:00]  And I was gonna be freaking out or something like that  Were you surprised that Eric was not here at 5.30?  No  Not at all  I came in and everything worked out  I had my first real day as an intern  It was alright  So I don't understand  Eric why did you  Why did the intern think that he was starting a week after he was actually starting?  They gave him the wrong information  Because there's another intern starting next week  That starts on the 4th  It's also confusing  But these two were starting this week  Right  And they were told next week  So how has this week been  As an O.P. Anthony intern? 
[03:36:30]  It's been good I think  I don't know  There's definitely characters here  Lots of runs  Runs are fun to make  I like exploring  Like shitting?  Are you talking like what Troy was doing?  Yeah exactly  I think I call it whatever bug he got in Mexico  Running into the bed  It's a parasite  It literally is a bug  And however you caught Troy's parasite that's in his ass  I don't want to know  Because Troy's not supposed to be doing that with any of the interns  Oh really?  He was  No  He told me it was part of the gig  Oh god damn it Troy  God  He just wants to feel pretty  Chris in New Jersey  Slaboo 
[03:37:00]  Alright so  Not necessary  Well you had a call  I gotta take the calls  No you don't  So I was screening your calls yesterday  Yeah  And a guy called in with the shlabo thing  And I did not know that was an inside thing  And I'm looking around  And I'm like  Am I supposed to put this through?  Or I wasn't sure if he was being a jerk to me  After the show  I was like  You put every one of those  Well I've made it clear  Because the problem is with the after show  Is that people  Like they kinda  I do a lot of phones  And so people want to get through 
[03:37:30]  And a lot of people were  Putting something fake on the screen  They'd call Sal when he was phone screening  And say  Oh I want to talk to the new intern  And then I'd pick him up  Thinking  Oh we could go somewhere with this  And they'd just yell slabo  Yeah  And I told them  I don't have a problem  With yelling slabo  I have a problem with  In my head  Trying to figure out what's what  Yeah  I said if you want to yell slabo  Just let us know  Tell the phone screener  That's what you want to do  They'll put it up for me to see  And I'll get to you  I promise  Alright then  Duly noted  The problem is now  Everybody goes crazy with it 
[03:38:00]  Now we're going to have  A full phone bag of people  Who just  Want to yell that word  So you were not terribly familiar  With the Opie and Anthony show  Not terribly  Okay  So you didn't  Like you didn't know  What slabo was  No  Did anybody explain to you  What it was  Something to do with Eric I think  Okay  Do you think  I didn't say that  Is that just based on  Your experience  Or did somebody tell you that  I'm not at liberty  To say that  Okay so maybe  It's just looking  I didn't tell him  It was rolling dude  Well I didn't know  If he had just  Was like  Okay well  Slabo  That can only mean one thing 
[03:38:30]  Or if somebody told him that  That's something I wanted  To get to the bottom of  What have you learned so far?  It's been a week  Yeah no I learned  How I got  I can get coffee now  I can  I can set up the studio  Pretty well  Okay that's something  Set up the studio  Is a thing  Yeah  Let's see  Yeah put the papers  And pens in the right place  Before the  Opie and Anthony  A lot of the interns  Are very nervous around here  Yeah  They come in  They're very nervous  Because you know  The shit goes down  Yeah  Here on the Opie and Anthony show 
[03:39:00]  And after Opie and Anthony live  Is there anything  That you're nervous about  Or do you walk around  Fairly confident in yourself?  I'm probably  I'm a nervous guy  Like in general I feel like  You are  So I don't think that  I'm any more nervous here  Than I am at like  Other aspects of my life  I'm trying not to step on toes  That's my main thing  I'm trying to kind of  Fade in the background  Do you have a favorite person here yet?  Favorite person here yet?  Gosh this is right  Sal tells me what to do the most  And I haven't screwed up yet  So I'm going to lead with that  But I'm guessing that  This will turn against me  At some point 
[03:39:30]  Sal is your favorite person right now  I don't know  Your predecessor hated him  Yeah  Intern Alan  Yeah you know that right Sal?  Okay you know  Yeah he hated him bad  And yeah Sal might hate me right now  So you knew intern Alan?  Yeah so I did my freshman year  At Fordham University in the Bronx  And he lived on my floor  And when I heard he was interning here  I was like oh word  That might help me get an internship here  And then as soon as I got the internship here  And started talking to people  It seems like that might have been like  The biggest thing that might have  Lost the internship for me 
[03:40:00]  Was knowing Alan  He told everybody that you wanted to get an internship  Because he got a picture with Marc Maron  Yeah that's not true  And you were hoping  I needed an internship  You could also get a photo with Marc Maron  Yeah I know  My end game of interning at the O&A show  Is not a photo with Marc Maron  I can tell you that right now  Because he was just on  I don't know for sure if he'll be on  This summer he lives in LA  That's totally fine  You know if that's your goal  It's not  I like to see the internship's complete goals  I haven't even seen the show yet  Yeah I don't know  Alan also described you as a hipster  Really? 
[03:40:30]  Yeah  Which makes no fucking sense  Alan actually looks more like a hipster  If I could describe Tyler  He's a little  He's more like a yuppie  Than a hipster  Wouldn't you say?  He's got hockey hair  Yeah good call  It's like a hockey jock hair  It's like  It's the cool guy  On Mighty Ducks though  It's not like hockey now so much  As it was hockey in like  97  Like if you were in a movie  In 1997  All the girls would be into you  Yeah  Because he's got  He's kind of got  Jonathan Taylor Thomas hair 
[03:41:00]  It's like  It's kind of long  It's good hair  It's flow  And it's long  It's almost to his shoulders  And he's got a nice  Like a green button up shirt  He doesn't smell every fucking day  He doesn't smell every day  He always walks in  With his shirt tucked in  And it's a different shirt  And it's clean  And it's a clean shirt  Which is way different  Killing it  Like how many shirts do you have?  Nice shirts  Nice shirts?  Like collars?  Yeah  Is that how I call my nice?  Probably like nine?  That's a huge amount of nice shirts  For the interns around here  Is it?  So you are way ahead of the game 
[03:41:30]  Let me go to Ben in New Jersey  What's up Ben?  Hey how's it going?  I have two comments  One this new guy  He sounds like he's on the ball  Well dressed  He's going to replace Sal  That's a good call  And my second comment is  Slipping  See and that works  Do you think to yourself  Because you've got to realize  What is your end goal?  If not to get a photo with Mark Maron  As I thought it was 
[03:42:00]  We were informed  This is the intern  Who is doing this  Specifically  To take a photo with Mark Maron  I said to myself  Why wouldn't he just go to a book signing?  And no  Intern Alan Thicke Jr. said no  You've got to remember  Who the information is coming from  He's a bit of a dumb guy  What is your end goal?  For this internship  Or like life in general  We'll start with the internship  Before we get into the big picture stuff  Getting scary here  I've wanted to work  In a radio station for a while 
[03:42:30]  I did my college radio station  For a little bit  I guested on other people's programs  Because I transferred  What year are you?  I'm going to be a senior next year  Okay  That's when I started my internship  With the LB and Anthony show  Young man  Yes  Alright  I'm following in great footsteps  That's exactly right  They kind of point out sideways  But they're still good footsteps  I'll see if I can get my fee in them  I don't know  Yeah  But  I've wanted to work in like  A real radio station  And I applied to  Basically every internship  That Sirius had  Because I knew I was going to be  In New York this summer  Right 
[03:43:00]  And this is like  The place I want to work  If I'm going to be like  It's a real radio station  Like legit  And  The music and sports  Didn't get back  I sent them all in the same day  Music and sports  Didn't get back to me  I applied for Howard  And there wasn't a specific  Gopi and Anthony one  But I got a call back  Like later that day  Like hey we're all full for Howard  But would you want to do O&S  Is that where we get our interns  Eric  Are they just rejects from Howard Stern  No  Is that why most of our interns  Have been so shitty  No  Are you sure  Because the picture  That Tyler is painting for me now 
[03:43:30]  Is that  Yeah  They looked at his resume  Over at the Howard Stern channels  They were thinking  Nah  I don't think this kid's going to  Cut the mustard for this semester  But we could throw him  To that other shitty show  No  There's a specific section  On the website  Where you can specify  For Opie and Anthony  That's not what Tyler did  I don't know  But he also  Howard wasn't his first pick either  Who was the first pick?  Music and sports  Yeah sports programming  That would have been boring  Yeah  Yeah yeah  The right thing happened  I don't think I'd be 
[03:44:00]  At a microphone  You definitely wouldn't  This is the right thing  You'd be at a computer  With a couple of fat guys around you  Thinking that they were on the air  Just like you know  Talking like they're sports broadcasters  Have you seen what the sports department looks like?  Yes  You're too pretty to work over there  Am I?  A couple  They'd eat you alive  A couple of fat guys  That would be  Just sitting behind your desk  Just speaking to each  Wearing jerseys  Speaking to each other  Yeah  No mics  Not being recorded  Going  I gotta tell you  These bears are looking good 
[03:44:30]  And you know  The further they go  The further they're gonna go  With each win  Is gonna come another win  Confidence is building  And you go  Sam I'm just trying to take a piss dude  Why are you doing this in the bathroom?  Why are you talking like that?  You're not having a conversation  Like they just broadcast  Yeah  Wherever they go  24-7  But they're not even on the air  People  Like they're just  Like you know how  You know how  When you're walking around the city  Sometimes a rapper  Like a wannabe rapper  An aspiring young man  Will literally rap 
[03:45:00]  As he walks down the street  Thinking  That some  That Jimmy Iovine  Is gonna be walking down the street  And going  Oh my god  What a great rapper this kid  I gotta give you a music deal today  I think  That these sports guys  Walk around here  Yelling  Like they're mad dog Russo  Thinking  That a program director  Is gonna be like  My god  If that's the way you speak  Conversationally  I gotta get you on the air  The insight  In that conversation  That you just had  In the urinal  With Sal  Who was trying to  Blow his brains out 
[03:45:30]  Was unbelievable  And that's how  The program director  Talks too  Cause he's also  All those sports guys  He's auditioning as well  Yeah they're all just  Auditioning 24-7  You wouldn't have liked it at all  And the ONA show  Gets way better athletes  And ex-athletes  Than those  I don't even think  The sports channels  Want athletes  They just want to be able  They just like to talk  Yeah they just want to  Any athlete that comes on  Is interrupting their time  To just talk about  The athletes  What did  What was the conversation 
[03:46:00]  Like when Eric  Called you on the phone  I was terrified  Really  Oh yeah  I'm like not  Like phone interviews  Are hard  Why did he sound  Like Jabba the Hutt  Nah  I was probably  Like mad awkward  About it  I was just kidding Eric  No you weren't  You're getting a punch  Oh man  He will hit me too  That stinks  He hits hard  Go on  Yeah I'm  Just phone interviews  Are weird  Like they just kind of  Happened  Like you call  And all of a sudden  I had to be like  Professional  And like really 
[03:46:30]  I like just ate a burrito  And I'm like behind  Chipotle  Like trying to find  A quiet area  That hopefully is service  You hear that Eric  A little food joke  From Sally boy  And you're getting a punch  Eric's handing out punches  No just to you Sam  Why did I get the  You're getting Sal's hit  God damn it  Go on  I don't know  I like  Tried to pretend  Like I was this  Like confident  Suave guy  That like could handle  An internship  Of a professional  Radio station  You got the hair for it  I know yeah 
[03:47:00]  Well that's what I'm saying  If I came in for an interview  They could have seen my hair  And been like  Holy crap  You've got to hire this guy  If Gordon Gekko  If Patrick Bateman  Skipped two haircuts  That's what you  That's what you  Skip two haircuts  Skip two haircuts  You're two haircuts longer  Than Patrick Bateman  But it's still there  Pirate Trucker  Hey all these guys  Start out saying  Oh all I ever wanted to do  Is work at a radio station  And by the time you guys  Are done with them  They're like  I never want to work  At a radio station  They're all careless  Yeah  I'm going to do something else  Eric worked at radio 
[03:47:30]  For 16 years  After doing this show  E-Rock never wants  To work in radio again  Nope  Thank you Pirate Trucker  I don't want to work  Radio now  Stuart  Yeah yeah  You don't want to  Work in radio today  But luckily you don't  So Stuart  Stuart and Tulsa  Hey Sam  How you doing buddy  Good buddy  Well I'll just say  I've been listening  To Opie and Anthony  For about a year now  I got a  I found you on the  XM Dial  Quite by accident  Because I had been  I'd gotten so sick 
[03:48:00]  Of politics  I had to get off it  You know  And I've been listening  To Howard Stern  But I've read  So many books  Written by celebrities  You know  Like in Dave Mustaine's  New book  My wife got that  For me for Christmas  He's such a dick  And I listen to him  These people come in  They're at different  Points in their careers  Maybe they're up  Maybe they're down  And Howard  He asks these questions  Like he's so  Fucking superior  And the Opie and Anthony  And Jim Norton  I've been a Jim Norton  I've been a fan  Of his comedy for years  And I had no idea 
[03:48:30]  He was on the show  And like I was  So I start listening  To Opie and Anthony  Because I want  Something different  And I start listening  Like is that Jim Norton  And the Opie and Anthony  Guys are funnier  For one  And when they have  Guests come in  Like the Courtney Love  Interview yesterday  Was great  Because I have had  A very low opinion  Of Courtney Love  And Kurt Cobain  And the grunge scene  In general  For years  And they changed it  All around  You see  They put her  They put her in a positive  That didn't change my mind  But they put her in a positive  Like they made her sound good  Thank you  Yeah like when you guys  Had Mike Tyson 
[03:49:00]  And it was  I'm sorry  I'll let you talk  Yeah you're getting very excited  Is the only thing  Stuart  But I  I'm an accountant  I have to be excited  Alright well you enjoy  Accounting  And I want to thank you  For your call  And I want to thank you  For reminding Tyler  That the  I mean he didn't make  This choice  They just threw it at him  But  The right thing happened  Didn't it  It did  You believe that guy  Everything happens for a reason  Alright  Clint in Alabama  Sammy  What's up buddy  Good to talk to you  This kid has no chance  What so ever

[03:53:30]  Theorizing  On what you look like  I heard your response  To it  Which I appreciate  Yeah  Well I think  There's no reason  To be disrespectful  About it is there  Thank you  Yeah  How does that make you feel  That already  All they've done  Is hear your voice  On the other end of a phone  You haven't been on the air yet  Well  I used the phone screen  Over at K-Rock  In Fort Myers  So  Oh I was about to say  I used to work at K-Rock  And then they  Canceled the station  Yeah  It's all talk now actually  So you're from Florida  Yes  Did you ever know E-Rock  When he was in Florida 
[03:54:00]  I did not  Do you know that Eric  Is from Florida  I do  We've had this conversation  Born and raised  In this little tiny booth  Yeah  We've gotten well acquainted  You got  I'm not from Florida  Okay well  The intern just told me differently  Well  He is from Florida  He was in Florida at one point  And came from there two years  You guys talk about Florida a lot  Everyone talks to me about Florida  It's like the only thing  That they have  Eric  Loves Florida  Not sure  Do you know that E-Rock  And I don't know if this is  A big Florida thing  E-Rock used to drive a speedboat  To high school  Did you know that 
[03:54:30]  I did not  That's true  I don't have to believe it  I don't think that is true  There are photos  I swear to God  I swear to God  There's one photo  That you built a whole scenario around  He also loves Coke floats  But that's E-Rock  And we're not here to talk about E-Rock  There's all kinds of songs  You come from Florida  I do  So what brings Sydney to New York  This internship  That was it  Yeah  You were just like  What made you want this internship  Why not an internship in Florida 
[03:55:00]  Oh well  Because I already work at the radio station stuff  So I wanted to broaden  And get more opportunities  And stuff like that  And my brother is obsessed  With Opie and Anthony  He is  Like I wish I could play you  The voicemails I have on my phone  It's  They're awesome  Is he like a Sam Roberts fan  Who isn't a Sam Roberts fan  Great answer  Tyler why can't you be more like Sydney  I'm not  Nobody asked you Eric  You just said  Who isn't  Oh  Well I wasn't talking to you  I was talking to Tyler  And Sydney  And that's it  It's not an open ended question 
[03:55:30]  My brother was the one  Who made me apply  For the Opie and Anthony one  He's like  You gotta do it  You gotta do it  So you've been here a week  So where are you staying  I'm staying out in Long Island  Okay  You got family or something there  Yeah so I'm living for free  That's great  Yes  So that works  Because I'm still paying rent in Florida  So that sucks  That's horrible  Why are you still paying rent  You don't live there  Because I'm going back  I'm only here for three months  Do you live by yourself out there  No I have two roommates  Oh okay  And they're still making you pay your share  Well we're all poor  So I can't expect them to pay for me  I guess so  It's not their fault 
[03:56:00]  I'm in New York  I guess so  But you could just  You don't have to be like a nice person  You're both very nice people  You could be like this  We're not  We're not New Yorkers  That's why we're nice people  Is that what it is  The city hasn't  Maybe it's because you haven't been here long enough  We were walking down the road  And some like mail cart  Started going out into the street  And I started to like pick it up  And Sal was like  Just leave it  Well Sal is a mean nasty person  He's an only child  And his parents gave him way too much affection  So he doesn't have empathy for other people  So that's totally different  But  Yeah no  I mean you could think 
[03:56:30]  Like in your head you go  The right thing to do  Would be for me to help my roommates  But on the other end  If I just tell them  You guys are shit out of luck  For the next three months  What are you going to do about it?  Well then there's this thing called a lease  And signatures and contracts  I don't get into all the legalese  I don't know anything about that  So your brother is a big O&A fan  Were you familiar with the show  Or just know it through your brother?  Like when I'm in his car  I know the O&A show  Okay  That's about it  That's it  Like I don't even have Sirius  He's your older brother?  Yeah  He has Sirius  But he doesn't live with you 
[03:57:00]  No he's back  He's in the northern part of Florida  That I am  Oh I see  I just think of Florida as one thing  And if you're in Florida  You just know everybody  Eric seems to know everybody  Florida is gigantic  It is  It's huge  Eric is that true?  It is  Okay he would know  Eric would know  I'm a Florida expert  So what do you think  So you've been here a week as well?  Mm-hmm  Well no  Yes  Pretty much  Yeah  It's Friday  Start at the beginning of the week  It's a week  Right?  Yeah  How do you feel about the internship?  I like it  You've got radio experience 
[03:57:30]  Yeah  Do they teach kids in Florida  To join radio at a young age?  Because E-Rock was in radio  When he's at a young age  I'm from Florida  Well come on  That's ridiculous  You've got to get past that Eric  Is that something that's ingrained?  No I just got really lucky my freshman year  And got offered an internship  Of college?  Mm-hmm  And now you  So do you intern at these radio stations?  Do you work there?  I started out as an intern  And then I got hired  My god  And you're not even out of college  I'm a junior  Wow  What up?  Yeah  That's very impressive 
[03:58:00]  So what do you think of it here?  How does it compare to your radio past?  It's a lot more serious here than it is  Sirius XM  Is that a little pun?  Love it  Love it  She's got  She'll do her own drum thing  She's got it  I got it  So what do you  It's more  It's more serious  It's a little more buttoned up?  Yeah  For sure  A little bit more of a corporate environment?  Mm-hmm  What?  I don't know  What?  I don't know  You don't know  What do you think of the show?  The show's really funny  You like it?  It is  And it's really funny how uncomfortable the show makes Sal feel towards me 
[03:58:30]  He's like  Okay  Okay  Like label things  And he'll have me listen to stuff  And I'm like  I'm so sorry to listen to this  It's a  There  It's a  It's a  A bit called  Well  He calls her a bitch  I don't know  If you want  So Sal has been kind of  Pussyfooting around a little bit  Making sure not to offend the girl in turn  I like it  It's funny that you're super aware of it though  You're like  Why is he talking  I let him know that I'm super aware of it too  Like you just explained it completely differently to Tyler 
[03:59:00]  To Tyler  It's like  Yeah whatever  But why wouldn't you treat Sydney like a human being?  I do treat her like a human being  It's just I'm a little more  She's an intelligent young woman  Who's been in this business  And as a matter of fact  Sydney's got more radio experience than you do Sal  You putz  I appreciate the fact that you  Try and censor it as much as you can  I don't censor it  I just  I'm just like  I hope you're not offended by this  I know  I'm just like  Well yeah  Cut the audio line of Jim talking about  Him coming all over himself  You know 
[03:59:30]  It's like okay  Right  Yeah that line I say  As opposed to you know  And you're like  Look  How old are you?  20  You're like  I'm a 20 year old girl  I've heard guys talking about  Coming all over themselves before  It's nothing to me Sal  Okay okay  Okay then  We'll go forward with that then  Sounds a little bit  I mean  It's not part of my everyday conversation  Not at  Well now it is  Well yeah  A lot's changed  But generally speaking  That's not  That's not something  You would talk about every day  No  No I wouldn't think so  Wait what are you  That was a really good phone call 
[04:00:00]  And I have a feeling  Eric hung up on it  Yeah well then  Let's go to Corey  In Canada  What's up Corey  Hey Sam  I was just wondering  Is it true that in Florida  E-Rock's boat was called  The XS  I don't know anything about that  Is that the name of your boat Eric?  No  Okay  Alright  Well the caller wanted to know  So  One minute  We only got one minute left in the show?  I was supposed to be in your headset  Yeah you got a minute left  Oh my god  Well  I guess that's all the time  We have with you guys then 
[04:00:30]  Has anybody around here  Kind of been hitting on you  Or anything like that?  Sydney?  No  Not yet  I'd like to clarify  You know  Well I don't know  He's a good looking guy right?  Except that it's mostly dudes here  Well still  No judgment  No judgment  Exactly  Thank you  Tyler  I don't know how you guys  Get down in Florida  But we are judgment free  Here at SiriusXM  But there hasn't been  Any uncomfortable situations  With the men here?  No  Only walking here  It's weird  And why is that?  Because I have to walk  All the way from Penn Station  And I just get lots of 
[04:01:00]  Cat calls  Good mornings  And how are you doing?  Now you look very young  I know  So that's  Do you find that disturbing?
