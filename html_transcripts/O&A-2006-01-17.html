<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast began with profuse "Thank yous," immediately followed by a disturbing discussion about a murdered girl depicted in the New York Daily News. This transitioned into a conversation about parental discipline, with one host detailing harsh physical punishment he endured as a child, even involving a neighbor as a witness.  The discussion broadened to encompass child abuse and the limitations of external intervention.  The conversation abruptly shifted to Arnold Schwarzenegger's governorship and his role in executing death row inmates, focusing on a specific case. A racially charged comedic bit about chess playing styles among different races followed.

The show then tackled airport security, criticizing its ineffectiveness, and sharing negative experiences with security personnel.  The discussion returned to Schwarzenegger, this time focusing on a video of him interacting with women in Brazil, provoking sexually charged commentary and discussion of gender roles. Studio guest Patrice O'Neal joined the conversation, contributing his perspectives.  A scathing critique of the Golden Globes, particularly "Brokeback Mountain," ensued, filled with highly offensive and homophobic jokes, explicit descriptions of sexual acts, and repeated homophobic slurs.  A plan to watch the movie as a group concluded this segment.

The next section focused on movie lengths, criticizing *Wedding Crashers* and *Munich*.  The discussion of *Munich* devolved into violently anti-Israeli sentiments, contrasting them with "punk Jews."  Opinions on the film's portrayal of terrorists led to a broader conversation about humanizing historical figures like Hitler, referencing *Downfall* and *Bunker*.  A Golden Globes recap followed, expressing strong dislike for Gina Davis.  The hosts discussed maintaining an edgy persona in Hollywood, using Jim Norton's failed attempt to get a photo with Ellen DeGeneres as an example.  Further discussion involved navigating the entertainment industry and maintaining their edgy style while avoiding repercussions, mentioning Sean Penn and their anxieties about potential backlash.  A significant portion was dedicated to criticizing Sean Hannity and Fox News for their perceived bias, along with their own evolving relationship with their employers and their encounters with Michael Moore.

The show then shifted to technical issues with their XM Satellite Radio broadcast, particularly "pad data," and transitioned to audio clips. These included a *Family Guy* clip with Randy Newman, Arnold Schwarzenegger speaking Portuguese, and the song "Shit Dick" by People Haters.  A discussion about Howard Stern ensued, featuring audio of Emily Stern in a nude role in a play.  Studio guests Bill Burr and Patrice O'Neal reacted to the segments.  The hosts recounted past conflicts with Howard Stern and his staff, expressing strong negative opinions.

A large segment focused on listener-created remixes of audio of Emily Stern from a Kabbalah-themed performance, incorporating vulgar language and sexually explicit content.  The hosts, along with Patrice O'Neal and Bill Burr, reacted with laughter and crude humor.  They discussed Howard Stern's reaction during a Larry King interview. A taped segment of Howard Stern on Larry King was played. The show also included a newspaper article about their feud with Howard Stern, listener calls (including one about repossessing a midget's car), and angry and appreciative listener feedback.

The broadcast opened another section discussing God's alleged punishment of America, contrasted with supposedly pious nations suffering from natural disasters.  A caller, "Nutbag," criticized the New Orleans mayor's response to Hurricane Katrina.  The discussion continued to televangelists, Iran's nuclear capabilities, and Middle Eastern conflicts, using highly offensive and inflammatory language.  The New Orleans mayor's post-Katrina comments, including a controversial reference to a "Chocolate New Orleans," led to a discussion about race relations and the aftermath of the hurricane, again employing highly offensive language.  *Hotel Rwanda* and its code words were referenced. Patrice O'Neal and Don Cheadle's careers were discussed.  A listener-submitted audio clip of the mayor's controversial statements was played, followed by more calls and discussions about God's role in natural disasters. A caller questioned the fairness of God punishing those who pray.  A listener-submitted recording of Jimmy Norton aggressively confronting a caller, and a reenactment by the caller's 11-year-old brother, both using highly offensive language, were played.  The final segment focused on a controversy surrounding a sports commentator, "Pharrell," critical of Opie and Anthony and Howard Stern. The hosts discussed commercial radio's response to satellite radio and concluded with listener submissions for a "what did you learn today" segment, including offensive language and racial slurs.

[00:05:30]  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  covering up the dead girl on the front page of the New York paper.  No, I'm serious. 
[00:06:00]  That's my line.  A lot of people ask me, you know, you're a crazy dude.  Where's your line?  Where's your line with all this shit?  I can't deal with the dead kids.  I can't deal with that shit.  And the Daily News here in New York,  they got a picture of that girl that was beaten senseless.  That's disturbing.  That's a disturbing picture, man.  They got a picture of her in her coffin on the front page of the Daily News,  and it says, in a picture taken at our family's request,  this little Nismarie Brown lies at rest.  Hundreds of strangers stood on line in the freezing cold to pay last respect 
[00:06:30]  to a girl whose flight touched the city's heart.  The system failed, this poor little girl, they're saying, huh?  It happens every few years.  I guess it just does.  Like, they fuck it up, and some kid winds up getting killed.  What about that Joel?  Remember Joel Steinberg?  Oh, and he killed, yeah, yeah.  And he killed that little kid.  That was a few years ago.  A lot of years ago. 
[00:07:00]  A few years ago.  I still think no one should step in.  This is, I need my footnotes.  All right.  Yeah, pull your footnotes out.  Have your footnotes ready, because I think you're going to have a controversial statement.  I don't think that anyone should step in what a parent does with each other.  Even with things like that, like this poor girl, you know, she was a victim of life, you know what I mean?  But my mother, if you went back in time and saw how my mother raised me, they would take her away from me. 
[00:07:30]  But she needed to fuck me up.  My mother used to beat my ass.  Like, how though?  Not fucking shut my face in the toilet, but see how acceptable the beatings were when we were younger.  It's like now, it's like, oh, you're going to be taken away.  We used to get beat.  And the kids know that too, and they'll call you out on it.  You hit me, I'm calling.  I'm calling my, my thing, my mother needed to beat the shit out of me.  I used to have be a, like a, I had a bad arson problem. 
[00:08:00]  If you were, I was a powerful maniac.  I just burned shit.  Burn, burn.  And it was a point where my mother.  What kind of stuff?  Like, you got to explain that.  Okay.  We used to have screens on the windows.  Like, they were made out of some type of weird metal.  Yeah.  But they were fireproof.  But when you burn them, you can poke your finger right through.  So, I would burn them and then make designs in them because they would just burn, you know.  And I would burn paper.  Right.  It's logistic.  And eventually, you know, I would burn things in the bathtub. 
[00:08:30]  I would shoot a water gun that I would shoot in the light socket until the light exploded.  It just, I was just, until the light bulb just went bow because all the water that was in the thing.  And I just didn't have any sense and it came to fire and shit.  And my mother just couldn't go, sweetie, you know, fire burns and people will die and you got to be careful.  She had to beat fire out of me to where I outgrew it.  But during my outgrowing spurt, I had to be beat out of it until I outgrew it. 
[00:09:00]  And she beat me one time.  I was naked.  And she called the neighbor over because she was going to fuck me up so bad she had to let the neighbor know that look at what he did to see if it's justified or what I'm about to do.  All right, because I'm really going to fuck him up.  Because I burnt the kitchen floor.  I want a second opinion on this beating I'm going to throw at my kid.  She's like, why is there a rug in the kitchen?  I go, huh?  Oh, it's just I thought it would be nice to be put a rug right there. 
[00:09:30]  Oh, shit.  And she pulled it up.  It was just a big burn on the kitchen floor.  And my mother punched me in a rib cage, threw me down the stairs, fucked me up.  She had to beat fire out of you.  She had to beat fire out of me.  And she called the neighbor over and I'm just sitting there crying at what I'm about to get.  Yeah.  And the neighbor's like, oh, that's a, that's, yeah, you might have to take care of that just so she gets you justified and fucking me up.  She's got a second opinion.  So I know a lot of kids that, that's why there's a lot of murder, a lot of bad shit. 
[00:10:00]  Now, this poor little girl, I'm not saying she deserve to die or anything like that.  I'm saying that you can't interfere with parents when they have to do what they have to fucking do with their children.  Even with motherfuckers like this, you just don't know what abuse is.  So you're saying like, like, obviously in a perfect world, you would be able to distinguish what she was going through.  What she was going through.  To a guy that's getting a beating thrown to him because he likes to burn shit up.  Yes, yes.  But, but in, with the system that's in place, you can't distinguish that. 
[00:10:30]  So they'd be taking kids away.  They'd take kids away.  Right, right.  And the parents aren't allowed to exact the proper discipline, man.  The proper fear.  I didn't stop flinching when my mother came at me until I was about 14.  And that's when she said, okay, that's, I'm, I'm done.  She ran in there, I was playing chess and she used to call me, Patrice, come here.  And one day I didn't come quick enough.  And she came in and hit me with a broom.  And I was playing chess with my boy.  And then the mental fear was gone where I go, wow, moms, that just didn't hurt.  It's over.  And you can see her shoulders slump like, wow. 
[00:11:00]  My job is done.  My job is done, dear.  Good luck, sweetie.  It was my last beating.  I did what I could.  Like, she just was, wow, wow.  Didn't you hear me?  Like the same old, didn't you hear me call you?  With the same rhythm.  And I just like, come on, this is getting hacked, moms.  And my boy wasn't scared.  Because usually your mother hits you in front of your friends and they go, oh, shit.  Oh, yeah.  And it's just like, he looked and I look like, you know, we're in the, you know, we're in 
[00:11:30]  the middle of a heated game of chess, moms.  Mom, could you please take your stick and leave?  We're busy here.  That's all you got?  That's all you got?  So, it's like this.  I don't want to get the wrong, you know.  Sometimes I don't have the words I need to express the situation.  Because, you know, I say some fucked up shit, but I never see no little girl deserves to  die.  But I'm saying that I think sometimes it's like those sacrifices to be able to have people  discipline their kids to be, so that they don't fucking grow up and be out of control 
[00:12:00]  psychopaths, man.  Well, there's a lot of brats out there these days, so.  There's a lot of kids.  You see them shaking them in the mall, cursing them out, and people go, oh, you know, that's  terrible.  Oh, that's not.  Yeah.  You know?  Or your buddy, if you, you know, you curse your girl out and somebody goes, dude, man,  she's a girl.  She's a nice girl, you know.  And then you go, you don't tell me how to fucking raise my bitch.  It's like, I, I, she's fucking, she's nuts and I need to talk to her like this sometimes.  Did you hear that?  Raise my bitch.  Now, a lot of people out there are going, wow, Patrice has a kid. 
[00:12:30]  He's talking about his girlfriend.  My girl, yeah.  Don't tell me how to raise my girlfriend, motherfucker.  You know, I'm raising your bitch.  It's not my, not my, no, I don't have no kids, but I'm just saying, it's like, people  that, that interfere with how you do things in your home, and it's like, you know what,  in retrospect, you fucked up, motherfucker, you killed your kid.  Yeah.  But during a situation, you know what's amazing, the most amazing part of that story, that  blacks play chess.  Oh.  Jesus. 
[00:13:00]  That is inappropriate.  Like, chess, what?  Chess.  That's the, that's the, that's the story people just cut off at.  Huh?  Do you guys ghetto it up?  Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.  You get all, oh, like, nigga, king.  I bet you guys ghetto up that chess game.  We mix, we mix chess and checkers.  I'm double-juffing the pawn, nigga.  We, oh, shit, here come this bitch, get ready to take your little punk-ass pawns, nigga.  Mm-hmm.  That's how Keith plays chess like that, Keith. 
[00:13:30]  Oh, really?  Ah, stupid, here comes a king.  Rah!  Norton's good, too.  Norton's really good.  Yeah, no, I love playing chess.  Norton's really good, but he's not as good as Keith.  But how do you play chess if there's no kings to capture?  Oh.  They leave early in the game.  Is that what you're saying?  This is-  They leave all them pawns just sitting there.  Them poor pawns with that queen.  It's so funny.  The race, the cleverness that racism brings people.  King and queen.  What do you know about a king and queen? 
[00:14:00]  There's no king in there.  King fucking leaves.  All the pawns are sitting there.  No fucking king.  The queen's got to go out and do something, so they leave all the pawns with the fucking bishop.  Look at that pawn, Marty.  It looks just like him.  The game ends when your opponent captures grandma.  Oh, my God.  Oh, look at this fucking fucking chess.  Just fucking Roddy Dangerfield with the racist jokes with the-  How you go, oh, is that your pawn is daddy? 
[00:14:30]  You know what the issue is with this whole case is that you think that people are in place to watch this shit and actually take care of it.  And you learn after a while that everybody's job, no matter how high, the fucking president to the people of social services that are supposed to look after these kids, are all just going to work every day, trying to do as little work as possible and get paid as much money as they can. 
[00:15:00]  And put in their time and then go home and watch American Idol or whatever the fuck else they want to do.  No one wants to-  You want to think it's like a fucking movie where, you know, fucking Denzel's going to bust in and go, we got to save this child.  And pull him out and go through this big controversy and put his job on the line to show that he cares.  And they never take away-  No one cares.  They never take away the kid, that kid. 
[00:15:30]  They never save that kid.  They always save me.  They save the motherfucker that lights the building on fire.  Yeah, they save the one that needs to be there.  They save the one that needs to be there.  And it's like, but what you're saying about-  I say this all the time about terrorism.  It's like, just stop.  We can't win.  You know why?  Because some cocksucker, when I go to the airport, some cocksucker that goes in from 8 to 4 is trying to protect me against a guy who breathes killing me.  That's such a great point. 
[00:16:00]  So, you punch out, nigga.  You know what I mean?  Yeah.  You're done.  Terrorism's over for you.  Yeah, yeah.  But this motherfucker is thinking hardcore about how to murder me every second of the fucking day.  Kill him, my friend.  How do I kill him?  It's midnight.  How?  I will plan to kill.  3 in the morning.  Must kill him.  But 6 a.m.  Got to kill.  Kill American.  Kill them.  And this guy's like, what time are you doing? 
[00:16:30]  All right there, Benny.  I'll see you tomorrow.  Punching out on terror.  I'm punching out on terror.  I'm done.  Goodbye.  So long.  Now it's your turn to look.  Golden Globes are on.  I got to get home.  I got to get home.  The wife.  Ah, the old ball and change.  His job.  His fucking.  It's not a lifestyle.  It's not a culture.  You want to think it is and you hope it is, but it ain't.  I feel no safety at the fucking airport.  Nah.  There's not a bit of appreciation or thank you or nothing at the fucking airport. 
[00:17:00]  Dude, the last flight I took, the guy going through x-ray or whatever, and the guy goes,  there's something in your bag I can't identify, and then he's calling a guy over because he's  going to go through my bag, but then he goes to me, it's not mine, baby.  He goes, what, you know, what could it be?  I'm like, ah, it could be, I guess my PSP's in there.  All right.  Takes my word for it.  I bought a brand new Xbox 360 from California in a bag.  In a bag. 
[00:17:30]  Wrapped up in a fucking box, Xbox 360, as big as that fucking thing is.  I can go in and turn that motherfucker into, you know, super bomb.  Now, to their credit, the machines that it does go through, color-coded, it will pick  up explosives and show it as an explosive.  So if you put your PlayStation through there and there's no explosive color, then they know  it's probably okay.  How do you fucking know that, though? 
[00:18:00]  How do you know what the bomb thing is?  Because, like, it turns out a certain color.  What are you looking at, motherfucker?  It's like, they got, I doubt it's fucking Yosemite Sam with the cannonball and the fuse  coming out of it.  It's usually some type of plastic explosive.  The chemical composition of an explosive shows up as a certain color.  And I don't think Opie walking through there really fits the profile.  I know they're not supposed to profile.  Opie could go through toting a fucking tow missile launcher on his shoulder that led him  on the fucking plane. 
[00:18:30]  But, see, that's the next problem.  It's going to be someone like me, though.  Do you really think?  Oh, yeah.  A white sympathizer is not far away.  Fuck yeah, dude.  I don't, you know, that's what sympathizes.  You motherfuckers get guilty.  I'm not looking at the Arabs at the airport anymore.  I'm looking at all the other crazy fuckers.  I don't know.  Hell yeah.  Not white.  Well, you were the terrorists before Arabs hit hard.  You know, white people were.  The militia guys.  The militia guys were the fear.  You know what I mean?  The government.  Yeah.  That kind of thing.  So we got dead girl on the front page of the paper today. 
[00:19:00]  Yeah, it's pretty disturbing.  The other story we were talking about as Ecstasy of Gold was playing was good old Arnold Schwarzenegger  executed the oldest inmate there in California.  What was the guy deaf, dumb, and blind or something?  He was just, God took care, God gave him a death sentence, man.  Fucking guys on death row playing pinball and fucking Arnie comes in and kills him.  Governor, governor, could you let him off the hook or anything?  No.  Kill him.  He was like some badass motherfucker though back in the day, right? 
[00:19:30]  There he is.  We're watching him up on television.  I had to kill him.  He was of an inferior race.  My father was a Nazi.  We've got to get some clips of Arnold Schwarzenegger if the guys are listening in the back.  Well, everyone thought, I guess, because, you know, he's a Hollywood guy.  And when he was presented with the first case where he was able to, he had the opportunity  to grant clemency to somebody on death row, and he didn't do it.  And now he's just, ah, cook him. 
[00:20:00]  I could care less.  At least he's equal opportunity, you know, fucking Tukey and then fucking some old cracker  who just...  That's right.  He's got two in a wheelchair.  Oh, yeah.  You were ready.  Really close together.  And they both begged him for forgiveness.  Please, Arnold.  He was like the last fucking guy.  The last chance these guys had was Arnold Schwarzenegger.  And you know Tukey probably enjoyed his movies and shit.  I love fucking Predator.  He's like, ah, I'm Tukey.  Give me three lines from Total Recall. 
[00:20:30]  You can live.  I am Predator who played the guy with the big helicopter machine gun.  If you answer that, you go free.  Give me anything.  That's Tukey.  Give me anything from Running Man.  Give me anything from Running Man, but not the Predator.  One of my catchphrases from Running Man, give to me. 
[00:21:00]  What did I tell the guy from The Warriors in that other movie?  What did I tell him on the rooftop when I...  And you can go, oh, shit, Arnold.  Oh, shit, man.  You know, I saw it.  I swear.  I didn't get TV privileges until two years after that shit.  Damn.  You know, I saw it, Arnold.  I know everything after Terminator 2, nigga. 
[00:21:30]  I know the mud.  You put the mud on yourself.  Oh, and the Predator couldn't see you and shit, but kill him.  Kill him.  Oh, my God.  Oh, and that's who we think he is, man.  They should just have him with the fucking, that big broadsword from Conan and just have  him lop the heads off.  I told you not to lose your head, Tukey.  With one of his fucking catchphrases afterwards.  Hasta la vista.  Hasta la vista. 
[00:22:00]  He turns backwards to Tukey, and then with the sword, he turns his back to him and acts  like he's walking away, and then turns around and lopses his head off.  Oh, shit.  Filmed in slow motion for the press.  You tricked me, Arnold.  God damn.  I thought you were going to let me go, motherfucking shit.  Damn.  He's the guy now, man.  The power over life and death.  Well, we got Patrice O'Neal in the studio.  He's doing this WebJunk 20 on VH1.  The show's blowing up.  And you showed a clip this past week of Arnold Schwarzenegger in Brazil. 
[00:22:30]  In Brazil, yeah.  He was going crazy, dude.  And I was looking at that clip going, now this guy's basically running a nation.  Yep.  He is running a small country, basically.  People understand, that's back when roids were legal.  Like, Arnold was a...  Like, look.  It's like what you did.  Do we have that clip here?  I don't think so.  He is a roid...  He was a roided up fucking, like, animal, dude.  Like, Arnold was roided and crazy and hyper.  And it was legal to be that.  And that was back before, like, sexual harassment. 
[00:23:00]  Oh, yeah.  You know, like, before, you know, bitches actually go, ah, like, any little thing.  They used to take everything, like, up till rate.  Like, they would take an ass squeeze and a tits squeeze.  They wouldn't cry about that shit, did they?  That was nothing.  It's like, you know, and then if they complained, they'd be complaining to a motherfucker that was just like Arnold.  So, like, you know what?  Ah.  Whatever.  Hey, well, then stop wearing a skirt, sweetheart.  That was back when it was their fault.  Hey, you're walking.  You're walking to the guy you're supposed to complain to, and he's calling you honey. 
[00:23:30]  All right, honey, sit down there, sweetheart.  Ah, he squeezed.  What?  What'd he squeeze in?  Squeeze your ass.  Look at the way you dress yourself there, doll.  You got your stems poking out from that little skirt.  You're an attractive girl.  You can go far if you just give a little.  You know, they can fucking right out in the open.  Just give that.  That's back before all, you know.  We called it the good old days.  The good old days.  You know, it was like, you know, then the Gloria Steiners came, and it's just a fucking. 
[00:24:00]  Over.  You don't fuck around.  Now you can't even say, hi, have a good day.  He was roided up, like, roid roids.  Not for, not, and he admitted it.  It wasn't like these new, these new tricky roids.  It was just like, I'm going to, ah.  So he's, he's in, in Brazil, just, and you know, he got women trying to teach him different words, and it's like, um, tudo bem.  And he goes, ah, tudo bem.  And he's like, um, you know, desculpe, por favor.  Oh, and he's like, ah, booty. 
[00:24:30]  Ah, and he's just like, ah, making a sucker carrot.  Serious.  Get the fuck out of here.  You made a sucker carrot.  And then she's so uncut.  And I'm like, you know, Brazil is a country full of, like, not Brazil, but Rio, where he was.  Mm-hmm.  Prostitutes, man.  It's just prostitutes there.  Infested with prostitutes.  And that's back when it was hard, it was beautiful.  Pre-Aids and the whole shit.  And he was just making women so nervous, man. 
[00:25:00]  And she's just trying to be gentle.  And she's trying to, like, do the arm hook drink thing where, you know, hook his arm.  What was the context of that?  Was she interviewing him?  She was, he was there for, ah, man.  He was there for some bullshit.  The festival.  Yeah, for the festival.  Carnival.  Riding through Brazil with his muscles.  He was doing his thing.  And every time it was like, it was supposed to be for culture.  But it always ended up, ah, squeezing a tit and bumping the ass and hand goggle, hand glasses. 
[00:25:30]  And just, and the ladies, and they played, they was playing the teaching a motherfucker different language music.  Bing, bop, bing.  Oh, no.  And he's just groping.  Desculpe, por favor.  I picked you up like a six-pack bend over.  Let's go to Eric and George real fast.  Eric, what's up? 
[00:26:00]  Hey, guys.  What's going on?  Hey.  Uh, how crazy is it that two United States governors came out of a movie about an invisible alien?  Yeah.  Yep.  Hunting down people.  Wait, who's the predator?  Jesse, Jesse.  Oh, shit.  That's right.  Yeah, man.  Ah, you don't know that.  I put you to death.  Holy shit.  I did not know.  Come on.  Stupid me.  Yeah.  Maybe from like a serious movie like, you know, a river runs through it or something.  You know, fucking predator.  Anthony Hopkins is the governor. 
[00:26:30]  Yeah.  Something like, you know.  Robert Redford does sound like a better governor.  Right.  The horse whisperer as the governor.  Right.  You know, it's, no, it's, get to the chopper.  Ah, yeah.  I ain't got time to bleed.  Yeah.  But the governor, you are the governor, my friend.  That's because the American people love that shit.  They love it.  Ooh, I.  Come on, do it.  Come on, what are you waiting for?  Come on. 
[00:27:00]  And, you know, he was running off of his movie quotes.  He was using them as a platform when he was running for the governor, dude.  All the news is calling him the governator.  The governator.  And I'll be back.  Yeah, we know you'll fucking be back.  Hasta la vista, the taxes.  This is, I, I, I, I'm looking for Sarah Connor and everyone else's vote here in California.  All right, we get it. 
[00:27:30]  We get it, Arnold.  You're in Terminator, all right.  Is he the governor in the lead as far as executing inmates there?  No, fucking George W. has got to have the record.  I mean, the current leader.  I mean, you know.  Well, he's getting the most, he's getting the most.  You're not hearing about somebody in Oklahoma.  I think we kill somebody in Oklahoma every second.  Oh, got to be.  We reinstated the death penalty here in New York how long ago now?  12 years?  We got too many fucking liberal guys.  I know.  Dude, it was when Pataki got in.  So how long ago was that? 
[00:28:00]  Over 10 years.  Over 10 years ago, we reinstated it here in New York.  The death penalty.  Not even a, not even a hint that it was, we were going to use it.  We have district attorneys.  Not even something close where even at the last minute something was good.  They don't even try people under the death penalty.  They don't try them.  I don't think many people always try them.  And no one goes, oh, I was acquitted.  Oh, thank God, I'm not going to get the death penalty.  No one's even tried.  They don't even take the case to court under a death penalty case here in New York.  Because the death, because death penalty, conspiracy theory here. 
[00:28:30]  Uh-huh.  Oh, boy, it's a black-white thing.  Hey, well, suck it up, you motherfucker.  Oh, damn.  Most of those type of crimes, right, it's rare you get a tukey crime where you get a death penalty case.  Most death penalty is like, you know, Richard Ramirez, some crazy cracker eating somebody's face.  Yeah.  It's like death penalty, you know.  So they, the drug laws are the worst here.  Because blacks and Puerto Ricans are doing, are selling drugs mostly in this town. 
[00:29:00]  So you go to jail for 25 years for selling a bag of coke in more time than if you would, if you murdered a motherfucker in Harlem.  So change the drug laws.  That's what they had, the drug laws there.  That's the conspiracy is the drug laws are there to put the people they want to put away.  They make the worst, they make the crimes, they make the punishment to put the certain groups that they want to put away.  So if they want to put white people away, they make it a crime to work.  White collar shit, exactly. 
[00:29:30]  I gotcha.  Now I understand.  Stealing paper clips and calendars.  They would put motherfuckers in jail for 10 years, white people would be in jail.  That's like we're building the liquor stores in the neighborhood.  Yes, you are.  Selling the guns, the guns brought it.  When the liquor store closes down, who is it?  It's Jim O'Brien Realty, who owns the fucking building.  They're putting the liquor stores in.  Saul Bernstein.  I'm not blaming, I'm not being a victim here, I'm just saying.  It's the law.  You know what I'm saying?  So I'm saying that's why New York gets no death penalty. 
[00:30:00]  Unfortunately, I got no positive proof to come back at you with and say no.  I got nothing.  So we'll go to Chris in Saratoga.  Chris, what's up?  Nah, he's going to back us up a little bit.  I was a Marine in the Gulf War, and a platoon sergeant would ask us what is best in life,  and we would all say, to cross your enemies, see them put in before you,  and to hear the lamentation of the way.  That's from Conan, baby.  Yeah.  Blow shit up. 
[00:30:30]  They were called Arnold before they...  That is Conan, man.  Arnold made some badass movies.  Watch it out, fellas.  Maybe he's in the top five Superstar of all time movies.  He made some badass movies.  Even his bad ones are good.  Arnold, it was a string of bad 80s ones.  The Running Man, Commando, Predator.  Commando's great.  What's the one where, at the beginning, he's playing with fucking his daughter?  Jenny.  In the pool. 
[00:31:00]  Like, it's supposed to be this tender, sensitive moment with him and his daughter,  and his daughter is...  What's her name from Who's the Boss?  Is that Commando?  Oh, that's Commando.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  And it's so bad.  It's a typical bad 80s movie because you're supposed to...  They're supposed to show in a very limited time that he's got this close connection with  his daughter because the action's got to start.  So they can't, like, make this protracted, long thing.  So they do this montage of him and his daughter eating ice cream, and she puts it on his nose,  and he's like...  Like that big, stupid, fun laugh of Arnold's. 
[00:31:30]  With 80s music.  Yeah, bad 80s music.  We gotta do it right.  Yeah, yeah.  We gotta do it right.  Exactly.  And it just makes him look like a kid-toucher.  Like, it's not this father-daughter thing because she's taken by the bad guys, and, you  know, he's got to get her back.  And they just want to get this relationship down, but not interfere with the action.  Let's do 10 minutes.  I want fucking gunfire.  And he's always a regular English. 
[00:32:00]  He has a regular American name.  Like, what's his name?  Ah, Peter Morris.  What?  Ah, John Winters.  What?  Ah, John Winters.  Ah.  Everybody in his life is American.  His daughter is...  Ah.  Ah.  William...  William Burger.  What?  There's enough syllable in your name.  No, it's not.  I...  My name is John.  What? 
[00:32:30]  John.  C-H-Y?  John.  John.  Jenny.  Jenny.  Jenny.  Wow.  He's fantastic.  Chip.  Chip.  His name will be...  My name is Chip Williams.  What was his name?  What was his name in running man?  Uh...  Uh...  The Butcher of Bakersfield.  Uh...  What was his fucking name?  I don't know.  I'm going to find out.  I'll punch it up.  Oh, God bless fucking Arnold.  If you can't...  He's just...  But now it's like his legacy... 
[00:33:00]  You didn't want to see this be the thing that he done.  Ben Richards.  Ben Richards.  I am Ben Richards.  Ben Richards.  Ben Richards ain't born in fucking Austria.  Ben Richards.  I'm Ben Richards.  That's Arnold, dude.  That is the governor.  He's just saying...  I mean...  I mean...  To be fair to the guy...  Yeah.  These guys are on death row...  I mean, he happens to be the unlucky guy that... 
[00:33:30]  They're up for...  For...  For...  Their death row.  You're the last hope.  He's the governor.  But, I mean, let's face it.  It's not like the...  The state...  They were there before...  With an old wheelchair crippled blind guy.  I do.  He killed three people, man.  Three people.  He shot three people in cold blood.  Ruthless.  He was a ruthless dude, man.  He was a bad dude.  And, you know...  And he was a real redneck.  You know what I mean?  He has...  Every picture...  He has an AK-47.  Just like every picture...  Tukey was just like...  No, I don't see really anything wrong with that.  Exactly.  Because you got a couple of pictures... 
[00:34:00]  If you...  All those pictures of me...  If I kill someone...  All them pictures come out.  Someone's calling you out there, Patrice.  John in Florida.  John.  What's up, boys?  Hey.  What's up, man?  I got a serious question here.  Go ahead.  I love you, Patrice.  You're hilarious.  But how in the hell did you get a female Irish person's name?  It's...  I'm named after...  Can I...  Can I...  I give them the history behind it?  Yeah.  My name is Patrice.  There was a black guy, the Congo president back then.  I was born during when black people named their children. 
[00:34:30]  They had to name them after somebody important black.  So there was a lot of Marcus's, a lot of Malcolm's.  You know, my middle name is Malcolm.  So it was a toss-up.  My mother let my...  Her cousin name me.  And she was...  It was a toss-up.  Either Patrice or his last name, which was Lumumba.  Oh, shit.  Oh, shit.  So, wow.  It was like my mother...  My mother...  She wasn't drinking that day.  My mother's like, look, we'll go with fucking a girl's name and deal with it.  But we're not going to let my son live with Lumumba. 
[00:35:00]  You wouldn't live with Lumumba.  There'd be free Lumumba signs right before your fucking electrocution.  You don't go through life with the name Lumumba.  Lumumba is right.  It's not like, and let's bring up the vice president of IBM, Lumumba, Lumumba.  Let's bring him up here now for the keynote speech.  No, that's free Lumumba as their fucking candlelight vigil is outside the penitentiary.  I'm named at the... 
[00:35:30]  I'm named at Patrice Lumumba.  And France, my name is very manly.  Is it?  Yeah.  Patrice is Patrick of France, so...  Yeah, I mean, it's better than that.  My middle name is Malcolm, so I mean...  Well, you made that make sense, I've got to tell you.  I could have been Lumumba.  I've seen a few more Patrices, though, around.  Girls, mostly.  No, I've seen a few guys with the name Patrice.  No, you're the only Patrice I've ever run into.  Yeah, guy.  Yeah.  Anyone watch the old Golden Globes last night?  No, but I heard about it.  Another one of these Who Cares award shows? 
[00:36:00]  Heard about it on my drive-in.  I was listening to Little News, and I heard Brokeback Mountain did very well.  Yeah, one like everything.  Oh, jeez.  That's fantastic.  It won Best Picture.  It won Best Director.  Did Jimmy Norton present Best Anal Scene in a Country Western Movie?  Fucking pervert.  It won Best Song in a Movie.  Best Song?  The song's called A Love That Will Never Grow Old.  Oh, this is it?  Is this it? 
[00:36:30]  Yeah, listen.  All right, listen.  Is there any words?  Your man asks, yes, yes, yes, what?  Are they snuggling during this?  Oh, you like that, don't you, faggot? 
[00:37:00]  Because I know  I wish I knew how to quit you.  A love that will never grow old.  And I know  A love that will never grow old.  Oh, you like what you're doing. 
[00:37:30]  Oh, you like what you're doing.  Oh, you like what you're doing.  A love that will never grow old. 
[00:38:00]  Show me how you suck a guy's cock.  The last time I'm going to ask you.  I know  A love that will never grow old.  I'm scared of you, sir, and I'm protected by self.  I'm going to kiss you on the mouth.  I'm going to kiss you on the mouth. 
[00:38:30]  Do you want to kiss me?  Sure.  You're a fucking idiot.  This is a giant cock.  Hello, exactly.  You look like assholes right now, man.  He stinks, and I don't like him.  You're on me, let our hearts beat in time.  Asshole!  Asshole!  Asshole!  Asshole!  Asshole! 
[00:39:00]  Asshole!  Asshole!  Oh, those guys are mad. 
[00:39:30]  Oh, those guys are mad.  Well, let's go, dude.  That's our haunting tribute to me.  Did any other fucking movie have music for that shit to win? 
[00:40:00]  Wasn't that awful?  Oh, my God.  A guitar riff is better than that fucking horse.  That song stinks.  There was snuggling during that song.  I would take a Randy Newman song at this point.  Short people.  Randy Newman.  Randy, what do you do with Randy?  Short people, God.  I love L.A.  We love it.  Yeah, she's a family guy.  Oh, yeah.  Right.  What's going on?  Yeah.  I can't do it. 
[00:40:30]  Randy Newman, he's eating the apple.  And now she's looking at me.  And now she's not.  And now she's looking at me.  And now they're walking away.  He's so, Randy Newman writes back mountain.  And he's humping.  And he's humping.  He's humping.  And now he's not.  Now they're snuggling together.  Let's say hi to who to fuck.  Who to fuck?  Hey, who to fuck?  Hey, boys. 
[00:41:00]  How's it going today?  Hey, man.  Black Jimmy, what's up?  Black Jimmy.  Black Jimmy.  Are you dead?  I'd rather you call me a piece of shit than you're Black Jimmy.  That is an insult on a couple of levels.  Cold-blooded cocksucker.  Fuck you.  What kind of mother left her cousin, name her son?  Yeah, no shit.  She's an older cousin.  My mother was 21 when she had me.  Young thing.  And, uh.  You're not a fucking baby.  Just name him.  Well, all right.  Fucking Jim, you cuss. 
[00:41:30]  Well, who the fuck?  What were you really going to say?  You had a good line on the phone.  A love that will never grow old.  Because they'll both die from AIDS.  Jesus.  Oh, my God.  Jeez.  Oh, he jazzed it up a little bit.  Good God.  What the fuck is a pure asshole?  Jesus.  Everything's trash in my home.  Family.  And he goes with an AIDS joke to wrap it up.  Wraps it over the old AIDS joke.  And, you know, just complete confidence in it, too. 
[00:42:00]  No inhibition.  He certainly did.  You have AIDS.  Yes, you have AIDS.  I hate to tell you, boy, that you have AIDS.  You got the AIDS.  You may have caught it when you stuck that filthy needle in here.  Or maybe all that unprotected sex put you here.  It isn't clear.  But what we're certain of is you have AIDS.  Yes, you have AIDS.  You've got AIDS.  But full-blown AIDS.  Be sure that you see that this is not HIV. 
[00:42:30]  But full-blown AIDS.  But really full-blown AIDS.  I'm sorry.  I wish it was something less serious.  But it's AIDS.  God, that is great.  Love that.  Oh, man.  How did they get that one, dude?  The other winners. 
[00:43:00]  I know, right?  How the fuck?  How do you get that on TV?  The other winners last night, if anyone cares.  Ooh.  Walk the Line won a bunch of shit.  Best Comedy or Musical.  Joaquin, actor in a leading role.  Philip Seymour Hoffman.  And Capote.  Yeah.  He's very good.  And Reese Witherspoon.  Walk the Line as well as an actress in a leading role.  You've got to be nuts to be a good actor, too.  Walk the Line was great.  The acting in that movie was great. 
[00:43:30]  Shang Li got best director for Brokeback Mountain.  Yeah, we said that.  Oh, God.  He had to.  That fucking Chinese motherfucker directing that shit.  How do you direct to...  I fag it up, you two.  And he's real Japanese.  A real...  You know, you know...  As far as...  Do something that would be very dishonorable.  All right.  We get it.  Do something.  Make my father kill himself.  Do something that your whole family would Harry Caray. 
[00:44:00]  That's it.  And the action.  He had to be best director.  You know, all that shit's got to be choreographed.  Like, you can't just go to two guys, you know.  Go ahead.  Fag it up.  It's got to be...  All right.  Now, put your arm around his head.  Now, cradle his hair.  And you know...  Now, gently lean in for the kiss.  And you know that...  It's like...  I didn't see the movie, but you know there's a scene where there is a fucking spooning. 
[00:44:30]  Of course there is.  Two man butt spooning and you got to make sure his dick ain't showing kind of thing.  So, it's like a lot of, you know, directing photography shit.  You mean it completely nude.  And you got to angle the camera.  So, it's just a...  One hairy leg over another.  And it's just like a lot of...  There's a lot of like...  And you know when they're filming, there's a lot of between preparation. 
[00:45:00]  Like, they'll go, okay, we're going to rehearse.  So, they got to lay there a little while.  And they got to lay there.  And then they go, okay, fellas, stand-ins.  So, there's some motherfuckers coming to make sure that they're at the right light.  So, that Jake and other motherfuckers go there.  Fluffers.  And they can do the lighting.  Then Jake comes back in.  They probably have a robe and whatever else they have.  And they have to lay them down perfectly.  And then they got to get them in the...  It's like clinical.  And it's just like...  There's no place where you like can drift off into this like, okay, all right. 
[00:45:30]  I'm playing...  I don't know.  I'm playing a sissy dude.  You have to.  You have to go away.  You have to...  You ever been in a situation where...  That's rough.  I've been in a situation where you're...  It really just sucks.  Whether it's just like family related or health thing or family emergency type thing.  And you're in the moment.  And it really blows.  And you just go, all right.  Regardless of how I feel now or in two hours or three, in six hours, this will all be over. 
[00:46:00]  And I'll be wherever I am and this will be done.  You know?  They had to be in that mindset where you're spooning nude with another man.  You're not gay.  And you got to go, all right.  Look at the clock.  It's 12 hours.  I'm going to be home.  I'll be in a sushi restaurant in six hours from now.  I'll be in bed.  I'm still the guy that everyone knows.  I've done some good movies.  I get...  People ask me for autographs. 
[00:46:30]  And it's not...  You think you purposely fuck up the scenes like two or three times knowing you can pull it off?  No.  Because you don't want to do...  You don't want the director to go, wow, you do that very well.  I bet you this movie had an all-time record.  I can't believe this is the first movie I've directed where we only had to do one take.  I guarantee there's going to be no bonus scenes because there was no DVD extras.  There was just one take.  This is the record for one take movies where it's like...  Like fucking an Ed Wood movie.  Where Jake is saying to Heath, look, nigga.  All right, put your cock in his mouth.  Cut. 
[00:47:00]  Great.  Perfect.  Let's move on.  Hey, you know the boom, man.  And some of the shots are bad because the cameraman's closing his eyes.  And he's trying to go out of focus.  Oh, Jesus Christ.  You see the boom?  Ah, fucking we'll just call it an art picture.  You see the boom in the fucking shot?  It's going to be number one on the film club site.  You can see the boom in the shot, the continuity problem here in scene 12.  And you know the cameraman did a couple of laughing in and outs real quick when the booty was moving. 
[00:47:30]  It had to be a rough movie to make if you're not a sissy, man.  Any of those.  A rough film to make.  Because it ain't like it was a fucking prison, the American Me thing or whatever.  Because that's just like almost...  American History X.  Right.  Where he's getting it in the ass from the fucking white supremacist guys.  That was a rough scene.  It's just... 
[00:48:00]  That's some cold-blooded shit.  Yeah.  But like the love part of this movie, I think just...  Oh, it's tender.  Which is why it's a flop.  Yeah.  For what it's worth, 22 million, that's probably the gay community.  Yeah.  You know?  And a lot of gay guys probably didn't want to go see that horse shit.  But it's like that's the love part.  Middle America?  Damn it.  The tickling.  It's the touching and the...  And you just...  That's what it is.  It's just like no one wants to see that shit.  The sweet talking.  The sweet talking.  The face touching.  Do you think there's a face-to-face shot? 
[00:48:30]  Look at Opie's face like, ah, damn.  You know when you gently...  You take your hand and gently cup a girl's cheek and get her chin and stuff?  You think there's that scene with two cowboy hats touching?  It's...  It's...  It's complete...  You know what?  We might have to like make a pact and like just have a field trip and have the whole show  go see this morning.  Oh, no!  Just so we can talk about this fucking thing.  Because who in their right mind is going to come in one morning and go, ah, guys, I went  and saw a Brokeback Mountain last night.  Guys, let me tell you. 
[00:49:00]  Saw a movie last night.  Not too bad.  I think it would be kind of fun if we all like come in and like we'll do a matinee one  day.  All like a field trip.  A show field trip.  Just go see Brokeback Mountain all together.  Yeah, just do like 10 or 10.  I would go if it's the whole show going on a field trip.  Right.  We all go and ruin it for anyone else in the theater.  Obviously, we wouldn't.  It would ruin it for anyone else in the theater.  Just make fart sound.  It would just be...  Oh!  Think of the entire show at one time just going, oh!  Oh!  Oh! 
[00:49:30]  And we'll record our reaction.  E-Rock getting excited.  Oh!  That would be the whole fucking movie.  Well, right from the credits.  Rolling credits.  Where's the ass shacks?  Someone has to find...  Fuck them!  Someone find out where it's playing in New York and we'll do a matinee in the near future.  Ben cut the bottom out of his popcorn box and Travis is reaching in.  I'll go like Anthony on a field trip thing.  Yeah.  Make sure everybody knows some...  I just... 
[00:50:00]  By myself, no.  No.  No correspondent.  No.  It's got to be a field trip.  Let's do a field trip, man.  Get your permission slips.  Ben?  We'll get our girlfriends to fill in our permission slips.  Yeah.  You got to go all out and see it in Chelsea.  I mean, you got to just...  Oh!  Oh!  Yeah.  That would make it even better.  Get to the seat.  You leave some Jergens lotion on your shoulder.  22 million.  That is probably the gay dollar right there.  Yeah, that's a gay dollar bill.  Well, a lot of people said it hasn't really been released yet.  It has been released.  Really?  No, they're just doing that thing where it's here and there. 
[00:50:30]  How long?  Here and there.  Let's play it in Chelsea.  Because they're not...  Of course it is.  Because Hollywood's not brave enough to just say,  Oh, fuck it.  We'll throw this thing in a thousand movies.  Well, when critics are jerking it off, no pun intended, you know what I mean?  It's like, when they just fucking on this movie, they're going to release it.  Well, they know exactly...  It's not going to be in 1,500 theaters.  You guys, we could get this done this week.  It's playing close and it's playing...  There you go.  Noon, 3 o'clock.  Oh, my God.  Let's pick a day, man.  That'll play in Chelsea forever. 
[00:51:00]  It's going to be like cash.  That's going to be the trailer for anything else.  Now and forever at the Chelsea Theater.  We could either go...  Groveback Mountain.  We could go tomorrow.  We could go Thursday.  We could end the week in style.  We'll go Thursday and talk about it Friday.  You want to go Thursday?  Oh, Jesus.  All right, we'll talk about that.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  It's playing right in the heart of Chelsea.  It's playing on 23rd Street.  Well, it's also playing up in my hood.  Why don't we go up to my neighborhood?  Watch his step walking down the aisle.  He's probably slipping. 
[00:51:30]  Probably like a skating rink.  How many bootlegs do you think is so...  Oh, my bootleg broke bad mountains.  I want to be getting that in Harlem on Ruling.  Yo, son, give me that Soul Plane.  Give me that Malcolm X 2.  That shit ain't released shit.  Give me that Brokeback Mountain shit, too, man.  Where's that fucking faggot cowboy movie?  That shit's crazy, yo.  That shit's crazy.  I'm just watching for a second. 
[00:52:00]  All right, getting back to the Golden Globes, by the way.  They did the TV thing as well last night.  Best drama, Lost.  Still haven't seen Lost.  Did they?  Because there was a rumor that they were going to accept the award in their ass.  Did they?  The Golden Globe?  What broke bad muffins?  He just bends over, shoves that big round globe up his ass.  Thank you.  Walks off face.  Dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun.  Walks off.  Why don't you try to take it off of Brokeback Mountain?  I just want to move on.  He's like, I got to bring it right back. 
[00:52:30]  Hey, we're going to talk about Lost.  He's like, ah, shit.  You think they took the globe right in their ass?  Walks off stage until the walk off the stage music.  And the winner is, boink.  Brokeback.  Television series, musical, or comedy.  They threw musical and comedies together for some reason.  Why do they do that?  I don't know.  I know why.  Because of the producers, I guess.  There was one stupid musical, so they had to find a category for it. 
[00:53:00]  Television series, Desperate Housewives.  Of course.  Anyone seen that dumb show yet?  I've never watched it.  Don't know anyone who's watched it.  I've never seen Lost.  Never seen.  I don't.  I've never seen, in the last five years, like, you know, regular television show.  Prime time, TV, half hour sitcom type drama show.  But I hear the shows are starting to get good again, like The Office and all that.  You know what I watched, just like last week, because it does so good in the ratings. 
[00:53:30]  And everyone talks about it.  So I watched an episode of CSI.  I don't know which one it was.  There's like 20 of them.  I watched one.  It was the dumbest, most like, you would have to be a drooling retard to accept anything  that's happening in this show.  Like, the science stunk.  The fucking cop work stunk.  The plot line, the like, loose ends that get tied up through some, you know, because  there's five minutes left in the show.  Yeah. 
[00:54:00]  It's just awful.  And this stuff is consistently number one in the ratings.  It's massive.  There's only one show, like, that changed my, two shows that, like, thank goodness for  reruns and all that stuff.  Never saw it when it was out.  Seinfeld.  Yeah.  Never watched it when it was on TV.  I never watched it when it was on TV.  But now I'll watch the same episode 80 times and laugh every fucking time.  And Larry Sanders.  I didn't watch it when it was out.  I watched it when it was on.  And it'll probably be Kirby Enthusiasm will be another show.  Like, I never saw it.  Never could watch it.  You haven't seen Curb? 
[00:54:30]  No.  But I know I'm going to because people love it so much.  I know at some point I'm going to watch it and go, oh, shit, this is fucking hilarious.  It is really funny.  But these shows, CSI, these, I've never gotten into Law and Order, even though they repeat,  I never can, that shit is just.  Hey, I'm really fast.  Let's go to John in New Jersey.  John.  Awful shows.  John.  What's up, boys?  What's up, boys?  Good morning.  What's up?  I'm smelling impromptu roadshow, by the way.  What do you mean?  Should we invite the listeners, too?  You want some listeners?  I will even try to get my shit-dick brother-in-law to do fair commentary for you. 
[00:55:00]  Shit-dick brother-in-law.  Well, good shit-dick, yeah.  We have a lot of new listeners.  We're going to break with shit-dick today.  All right, John, thanks.  Shit-dick.  All right, boys.  Should we invite the listeners?  Pick the movie theater at the time, and if you want to show up and see Brooklyn.  How much with us?  Oh, my God.  How much advance notice do we give?  All right, now we're taking this bit out of my neighborhood.  We're going somewhere else.  Are we?  We're not going to Chelsea.  I don't like my movie theater.  Wait, we're not going to Chelsea.  No.  We're not going to Chelsea.  No, somewhere close to the stage.  Somewhere close to the stage. 
[00:55:30]  And then we'll announce it, like, how far in advance of us actually going.  And if you go, you've got to bring some kind of recording device, because I know the listeners,  these guys, these pests are a bunch of assholes.  Not a camcorder, though.  Get us thrown out.  And they'll be yelling and screaming shit.  You've got to record it all, and then we'll play it all on the radio.  It would really be funny if we can pick up some, you know, audio of the movie actually going in the background  and see what we're commenting on.  So someone will have to sit right up front. 
[00:56:00]  Holy shit, our listeners are funny.  I didn't really, I'm sorry, I was reading instant feedback, Anthony.  I'm trying to be a better listener on this show.  That's all right.  DiggerDog from WhackBag.com.  Brokeback Mountain will be like Rocky Horror in Chelsea.  Guys in the aisle acting it out.  Fuckers in cowboy hats.  You think there's some secret creepy shit going on in the gay community in that movie?  Yeah, I think in certain movie theaters there's like some shit going on.  It's like a Cinemax porn for gay guys.  It's like one of those soft, those cheesy porns. 
[00:56:30]  Softcore porn.  A bitch is dressed like a spaceman.  Lady Emanuela.  One of those movies.  Emanuel versus Dracula.  You catch on fucking Cinemax late at night, yeah.  Softcore, just enough to get you going.  All right, we'll announce.  Not enough to finish the job.  We'll announce where we're going to see Brokeback Mountain hopefully by the end of today's show.  We'll set it up for Thursday?  Yeah, we should.  So free yourself up Thursday after the show.  So it'll be about, I don't know, noon, 1, somewhere in that area.  Brokeback Mountain screening. 
[00:57:00]  Is everyone going?  Yeah.  If you don't go.  If you don't go, you're a faggot.  Wait a minute.  No, if you don't.  If you don't go.  Aw, dude, don't be a faggot.  Come on, go.  That's home fucking my chick.  Faggot.  Trust me.  It would be worse if you did not go to Brokeback Mountain.  You gotta go.  That's home fucking my chick.  Fag.  Fag.  What are you, dude?  Gay?  Fag.  All right.  Quickly, too, here, miniseries or television movie, Empire Falls, who cares? 
[00:57:30]  Actor in a leading role.  Some dude from House M.D.  What's that?  Oh, that's the limping doctor.  That's that awful fucking Fox show with the doctor who every week.  House calls?  In his most challenging case he's ever faced.  Every week is the most challenging case.  Yeah.  You got some patient in there that's some disease.  They don't know what the fuck it is.  Yeah.  Is he doing house calls?  No, his name is House.  His last name is House.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  Oh.  Whatever.  Whatever. 
[00:58:00]  Actor in a leading role in musical or comedy series.  Way to go.  Steve Carell from The Office.  Steve Carell.  Funny motherfucker.  This is Steve Carell's year, huh?  It's about time that he gets some recognition.  The guy was hysterical on The Daily Show.  That motherfucker's great, dude.  He's like an animal now.  About time that he's broken out and done his own thing and proven what he's all about.  I watched that 40-year-old virgin and I was expecting, you know, I heard it was funny  and stuff and just expecting throwaway comedy and it was really good.  It was good, yeah.  Yeah.  A little long, though, no?  Yeah.  I mean, these comedies are a little long these days. 
[00:58:30]  Wedding Crashers is a great movie, but man, that movie goes on for fucking ever.  Yeah.  It could have ended like at least 10 times.  Easily.  Remember when movies are like an hour and 20 minutes long?  I mean, Munich too, man.  Munich just, it was eight times you could have ended Munich and man, okay, this is a good  movie.  Really?  But it just kept, it just-  Is that movie good?  Munich is a genius movie.  I hear it's amazing.  I love that shit.  Fucking genius movie.  I can't wait to see that.  Those fucking Jews in that movie.  Aren't they ruthless?  Ruthless.  Like, you screw with them.  You're just done.  Not these punk Jews we know. 
[00:59:00]  No, Israelis.  Not these punk motherfuckers on the Upper West Side.  Like, all right, they did this.  That's all fine and well.  I want them all hunted.  I don't care how long it takes.  I want them hunted down and killed for nothing but vengeance.  I just-  That fucking movie, dude.  I gotta see it.  It's one of the best murder scenes I've ever seen in a movie.  Really?  Genius murder scene.  Oh, great.  Gotta see it, man.  It's a good movie.  You gotta see that movie.  And he's getting all kinds of flack for Spielberg for being anti-Semitic, showing the human side 
[00:59:30]  of the-  He's just telling the truth.  Like, humanizing the terrorists and-  Yeah, what the fuck he wants?  What's the problem with that?  I don't understand when you humanize these monsters of history, why it's such a problem?  The same thing with Downfall.  The Hitler bunker movie that came out.  It was made in Germany, so, you know, leaned a little one way.  I mean, you can be a crazy motherfucking still, you know, be human.  The truth is, he was a human.  I mean-  Here we go again.  Oh, boy.  Get your footnotes, just to make sure it says that John Smith said he was a human.  By that, I mean, technically- 
[01:00:00]  Technically.  He wasn't born on Venus and shipped here.  Yeah.  You know, so when they humanize these people, I think it makes the movie better.  I mean, I'm sure there's some psychologists that could figure out how to blame something  that happened in his life for the Holocaust.  If someone would have just bought his fucking paintings, if someone would have bought  his paintings.  Hey, what's your name, kid?  Adolf Hitler?  That's a great watercolor.  They found out that mustache was high in a cold sore. 
[01:00:30]  A hair lip.  This guy had a hair lip and no one knew about it.  Hey, Stacey Keats' face, that's not funny.  You know who played a great Hitler?  I was watching the Golden Globes last night.  They gave Anthony Hopkins an award.  Uh-huh.  He was in a movie called Bunker?  Yep.  Holy crap.  Bunker was great.  He looked just like Hitler.  Looked like Hitler.  Acted like Hitler.  And then he did a good Nixon, too.  Even though he had that little accent going.  He was, but I mean, Silence of the Lambs fucked the rest of his life up, but he was- 
[01:01:00]  He's still doing it.  He's great.  He was a shit for a while.  Just getting through this real fast.  Actress in a leading role drama series, Gina Davis in Commander-in-Chief.  Ever?  I cannot fucking watch Gina Davis in anything.  Have you ever seen that show?  Do you know anyone who has seen Commander-in-Chief?  I cannot watch her.  Why?  You didn't like this?  There's just something about her I don't like.  Kiss of Death.  I don't like her.  No, Long Kiss Goodnight.  You didn't like that with Sam Jackson?  That was a great movie.  There's something about you.  The Fly?  Come on.  She didn't hurt The Fly?  Never thought she was sexy when she was younger. 
[01:01:30]  I just hate her.  She's kind of manly.  She's sexy, ugly.  She's a-  She's a big girl.  Yeah, she's a gorgeous, ugly woman.  You think she's gorgeous?  I don't see it.  A gorgeous, ugly woman.  Oh, gorgeous, ugly woman.  Okay.  She's a beautiful, ugly woman.  That is a category.  Actress in a leading role, musical or comedy series.  This show Weeds.  I still haven't checked it out.  What is that?  On Showtime?  It's on Showtime, yeah.  Mary Louise Parker.  Puck dealer.  An actress in a supporting role, series, miniseries, or television movies.  Sandra Oh in Grey's Anatomy. 
[01:02:00]  I don't know.  Sandra Oh is the chick from Sideways.  Oh, okay.  The blonde?  The Asian blonde.  Oh, the Asian one.  Okay.  Got it.  Sandra Oh, the blonde.  No.  That hot Dutch girl, Sandra Oh.  Hi, my name is Sandra Oh.  Are you like, do you like Reese Witherspoon?  You think she's hot?  Sometimes.  She's cute hot.  Yeah.  She's, she's, she's.  She was great and walked the line, too.  She's, I, she's like, she's like a, a fine ass, she's a fine ass, I looking bitch. 
[01:02:30]  Oh, you know what she was really hot in?  Um, interview with a vampire.  Oh, was that, no, that was, I know where you're going, but that was, uh.  That was the other one.  That was, uh, what, what's her name is?  Yeah, Kirsten Dunst.  I always get them confused.  Was that a bad joke?  Kirsten Dunst, dude.  I'm trying to, like, I knew where you were going, but it was just, I'm, I'm trying to  have a career, like, for real, so sometimes you just get nervous, because you guys are  just radio, so it's like, you could just smash a motherfucker, so sometimes I go, what 
[01:03:00]  if I do a movie with Kirsten Dunst?  And I'm being unrealistic, and she's like, I don't know, fucking Spider-Man 12, but it's  like, that is the ugliest white woman I have seen in the last, she got some weird  snaggletooth thing going on.  She is a funny-looking fucking broad dude.  You make a good point, too.  There was a point in our careers that we could have started branching out, like, and we kind  of, like, teased that a little bit, and did a little, little, little here, a little  there, and then said, ah, fuck it.  That's why I'm scared of doing these love junk 20s and these fucking I love the 80s 
[01:03:30]  shits, because it's like trashing niggas.  You just trash people.  It's like, I'm in the business.  I'm trying to make something of myself in this business, and you got me trashing the people  that can maybe help me someday.  I can, I'm going to call Sean Penn a fag?  Am I going to say that?  Oh, right.  But, you know what I mean?  Like, it just, like, what the, am I going to say trash Sean Penn?  But it's like, fuck it.  And down the road.  A little advice.  Don't ever lose your edge, buddy.  Nigga.  Too many fucking guys go out there and lose their fucking edge.  It's golden handcuffs.  Yeah.  Just, just go with it. 
[01:04:00]  Your mushy friend has it.  He's so Hollywood.  Oh, he is the worst.  He's starting, he's starting to, like, you know, worry about who he's offended.  He won't bad mouth anybody anymore.  But that's what I'm saying, you got to, in your mind, you got to just, you take a, take  a, you go, all right.  You take a go, as they say, all right.  You know what?  I'm going to just say what is going on.  You know, I'm just going to say it.  I'll take my chance.  By the way.  The mushy Norton Ned Hollywood phony.  You know what Jimmy does?  He beats up the little retarded kid on the playground. 
[01:04:30]  Won't touch, won't fuck with anyone else.  But the safe people, that's who he fucks with.  Well, let's, we'll have to test him because we missed a week of radio.  Like, he knows Pauly Shore ain't going to do anything.  He'll bash the shit out of Pauly Shore.  We got to test him, though.  We missed a week of radio, unfortunately, because of my stupid flu.  But we still haven't gotten to all the stories from Vegas.  We still got clips from the porn awards and all that, the porn you mentioned.  And then there's a great story of Jimmy getting completely blown off by Ellen DeGeneres.  Completely blown off. 
[01:05:00]  Ellen DeGeneres was at CES with a huge camera crew and an entourage.  They were just sweeping through CES.  And Jimmy, you know, when he.  What's CES?  What's that?  Consumer Electronics Show.  Oh, okay, okay.  And, you know, Jimmy has his camera ready at all times for his celebrity photos.  And so Ellen DeGeneres starts freaking out like, oh my God, this is a biggie.  She's huge right now.  And as they're filming, Ellen walking through the thing.  He doesn't give a shit.  He goes right up to Ellen DeGeneres to try to get a photo.  Ellen. 
[01:05:30]  And she says, no.  He walked up.  And Jimmy lost his fucking mind.  But he had like a strategy.  So it wasn't just a, can I have an autograph?  No.  His strategy was walking up to her and saying, hi Ellen, I'm Jim Norton.  I'm a stand-up comic also.  Would it be okay if I got a picture with you?  Like that was his selling point, that they had a common bond in stand-up comedy.  And she blew him off.  Just completely blew him off.  And he raged.  The shit he said about Ellen DeGeneres right after that. 
[01:06:00]  And one of the biggest things he was pissed about was the fact that, and he kept saying, you know, I'm a fucking stand-up comic too.  I told her I'm a comic comic.  That's the number one way to have somebody walk away is if you introduce them.  It's like if some guy I don't know goes, hey, I'm a stand-up comic too.  You go, hey, cool.  Now you want to go, yeah, man.  But your first instinct is like, ugh.  Who are you?  So basically Norton is just, she's like, who's this bubblegum-shaped human being who says he's a comic also? 
[01:06:30]  She probably looked at him up and down and said, you're not going to make it.  We got to get Jimmy on the phone.  You're a loser.  Yeah.  See what he'll say about that.  A couple things before we take a break.  Yeah, he didn't want to bash her too bad.  No.  Like he bashed, I mean, oh, he was ruthless in front of us.  But we were like, we wanted to record it.  We wanted to get it on the air.  And he's like, no, no, no.  I have faith in Jimmy.  We'll get him.  We'll get a hold of him in L.A.  Jimmy has manufactured fucking anger. 
[01:07:00]  He's going to say all his transvestite stories were lies.  It was just radio jargon.  He wants to fit in now to Hollywood.  Whatever conglomerate owns HBO, Jimmy's not fucking having shit up.  Right.  And it's hard to do.  It's hard to keep like that edgy, sarcastic, fuck the business thing.  Like Chris Rock had it.  And that's what they loved about him.  And you know when that shit took a turn is when he did the Oscars.  And it's like, oh, shit, I'm not the outsider, dude.  I'm like the inside. 
[01:07:30]  It's like you can see the nervousness between, oh, shit, I'm getting ready to trash Clint Eastwood.  But Clint Eastwood's here.  I'm not as much of a rebel as I fucking thought I was when I was out.  But that's the trick.  Let you in.  And then that's when the slave shit starts.  So when you don't have anything, it's like, fuck your mama.  Really?  Ellen.  Hey, Ellen.  How's that big dick clitoris you got there, you dikey bitch?  Fuck you and your show and all those goddamn crazy white bitches.  You and Oprah.  Ho. 
[01:08:00]  All you hoes.  And then they go, we love Patrice.  Hoo.  Oh.  You know.  Damn it.  And then it's over.  It's hard that you got to.  That's going to be a tough position to be in.  You got to fight.  Yeah.  Now, I trashed Viacom my whole life.  And then I go, wait a minute.  I was going through my books.  I'm like, every check I got is from Viacom.  No one else hired me.  Holy shit.  Viacom bought my house.  And I'm like, the corporate monster. 
[01:08:30]  Yeah.  Yeah.  The evil of corporate.  Hi, Eric Logan.  Give me a kiss.  Boy, you're young.  Coochie Coo.  But we're not Viacom, so.  But you know what I'm saying.  It's like, oh shit, you go, I'm a goddamn rebel.  I was like, Eric Logan was Viacom at one point, too.  Yeah, he was.  You're right.  We all were.  You know, but you guys keep your edge.  You know what I'm saying?  But you find that place, you go, whew.  But at some point, you do, like, after this last episode where you got nervous.  Yeah.  You took a corporate gulp, like, not gulp. 
[01:09:00]  Honestly, not really.  We've been here, uh, we've been here a year and three months doing this show, and we almost  got fired three times already.  Yeah, but you take the corporate gulp every time.  You do take that, that, oh God, no, Jesus Christ.  Oh, yeah, okay.  That's what I mean.  I thought you meant, like, completely losing the edge.  No, no, no, not selling out loud.  I mean, like, I mean, like, fuck.  Fuck.  After, after it happens.  We try to be smarter, but we still have gotten, uh, you know, three things that happened that  came close.  When we put ourselves in those situations and it happens, yeah, you go home and go, oh my 
[01:09:30]  God, what the fuck did I do?  Oh no, did I fuck this up again?  Yeah.  Something that was going on in early December, I was convinced that, well, I wasn't convinced.  I, I was like, it could go either way.  All it, all it takes to have edge is to say something like, okay, let's all go see Brokeback  Mountain.  Like, motherfucking the business goes, like, like Hannity yesterday, Sean Hannity, you  can see, that, he took a corporate gulp when we started getting about, talking about Lincoln  and slavery, and he just, okay, I'm going to stay out of this one. 
[01:10:00]  You know what I mean?  All he, all he heard was Martin Luther King, Lincoln, slavery, and it's Martin Luther King  day.  And, and bullshit and crazy.  And he's, and he, and he's talking to ONA.  Now this is a mathematical formula he had in his head.  Details didn't matter.  Why we were talking about it in the context, nothing of this mattered.  It was, it was Martin Luther King over ONA times slavery divided by Lincoln equals, I 
[01:10:30]  shut the fuck up.  Don't talk.  And that's what he did.  He's a smart man.  You know, I, he has balls though, cause he's been on our show many times and he knows what  we're all about.  Yeah.  And he's a fan of this fucking show.  He knows just talking to us in a certain situation can get you fired.  Yeah.  If you're in certain circles.  But you got to give him credit cause he's, he likes the show.  Yeah.  So it's just like, it's, it represents something that, things that he can't do.  Hannity gets a bad rap a lot of times with, um, left leaning people, people that want 
[01:11:00]  to criticize him, people that want to call him Rush Limbaugh Jr.  Shit like that.  But if you've ever actually listened to his show, he does have his own mind.  Of course he's right leaning and he's conservative leaning to, you know, say the least.  I would say fucking stumbling and tilting and falling.  But not, but, but not really.  Not leaning, motherfucker.  Let me tell you something.  Let's not be that fucking coy with it.  I say that because.  You actually told me once he was a moderate.  I'm like, what?  Well, I say, I say that because he does look at things and if, if he sees something fucked 
[01:11:30]  up on the right, he'll call him out on it.  It's not like these guys that just plow through and, man, President Bush is doing great no  matter what.  Don't call him out on it.  Well, he sees the trend.  What trend?  That it's a sinking ship with this Bush, motherfucker.  You can't be on Bush's side right now.  No, he was, he was talking shit about Bush before this, though.  He was.  Dude.  If he was a real moderate, he would get rid of Alan Combs and get a real guy in there  that could like, you know, fight.  Challenge him. 
[01:12:00]  Holy shit, Alan Combs is the worst.  Oh, poor Alan Combs.  Alan's a man.  The one thing you got to say, I don't know which book it was.  It might have been Al Franken.  He was like an ugly woman.  Oh.  I went on this.  Oh, Jesus.  It was like Ruth Buzzy.  It really does.  I'm like, look at Alan Combs.  When we got, when we got fired.  Oh, that's bad.  When we got fired, I decided to start reading a lot of those stupid political books.  Oh, God, no.  It was all the rage for like two or three years. 
[01:12:30]  It started to calm down.  It was like a Michael Moore book than an Al Franken book.  And then that, that, that, that bitch, the blonde hair lady, what the hell is her name?  She's the.  Oh, Aunt Coulter.  Aunt Coulter.  Holy shit.  I was reading these books like once a week, man.  And one of them, I think it was Al Franken when he refers to Hannity and Combs.  He writes Hannity in big, bold, bold face letters.  And then Combs is so tiny in the book.  You can't even, you can barely make out his name. 
[01:13:00]  And I'm like, that's fucking brilliant, man.  Because that's how that show is.  They try to make it sound like you're getting, you know, both sides of these fucking.  Fair and balanced.  Fair and balanced.  It's just not.  But here's the sad thing.  I can't.  CNN is unwatchable.  It's unwatchable.  It's like, you shouldn't even say that about the news.  Yeah.  But you go, it's not the news, though.  This spin stinks.  Let me, Fox is so interesting to watch.  Fox is action-packed. 
[01:13:30]  They have the Fox News alerts that come out of nowhere for nothing.  But nothing is like, this Fox News alert just in, the weather, it's going to be a couple  of degrees cooler than it was yesterday.  It's like, wasn't the Fox News alert, like, born during the war, just keep us updated on  it?  And now they just use it, like, for everything.  But those books, man, they're dangerous.  Because you read one stupid book and you think you know how the whole world works.  Michael Moore's book changed my whole life.  And when I read six pages, and then I'm ready to have a fucking debate with Donald Rumsfeld. 
[01:14:00]  I'm like, listen, let me say this.  Listen, man.  If 19 Koreans flew a plane into a building, you would say, Korea has attacked America.  19 Saudi Arabians flew a plane into a building.  You say terrorists.  Why is that?  I believe it was the Saudi Air Force.  And I'm sitting there going, yep.  It was.  It was the Saudi Air Force, man. 
[01:14:30]  How can that be?  Mohammed Atah was a train, and then I go start asking pilots, was it just a little bit of  training?  Can you fly a plane into a building?  No, it takes years of flying.  Ah!  See?  Now I've backed it up with an expert.  Dude, I was reading those books thinking I had all the knowledge of the world.  Well, that was in social situations, just rattling off the shit I fucking read that day.  Like it was a, like Michael Moore was telling me facts.  You started rattling it off to Michael Moore. 
[01:15:00]  Oh, yeah, I did.  He did.  Because his whole, I read that book.  Yeah, we met Michael Moore about two years ago.  It was a fun night.  That book made so much sense, but it's just like that propaganda, I'm such a putty, I'm  so squeezably soft.  You're the guy that reads the leaflets drop from the planes and goes, yeah, yeah, this  makes sense.  Propaganda.  Oh, well, I got out of that mode.  Hey, a couple things, because we're really trying to break here.  I don't think we're breaking anytime soon, by the way. 
[01:15:30]  We got to fix the pad.  What are our listeners going to do without commercials?  We got to fix the pad data on the units.  Yeah.  Well, we talk for an hour, hour and a half at a time, and it fucks up everybody.  You can't like, you know, if you have a MiFi, this is one fucking track right now.  We were supposed to have access to the pad data.  Pad data, people, is that printout on your unit.  Whatever it says right now.  Don't look at it.  You're driving, stupid.  How many people just looked and went, yeah, that's exactly what it says. 
[01:16:00]  Don't look.  Don't look, because this could be worst of, and then it's like Opie and Anthony worst of.  Yeah, but it's not.  But until it is.  Until it is.  Then it is.  We'll be soon, because we'll probably take another day off.  I'm exhausted.  I figured we'd give him a good hour and a half.  But, yeah, the pad data, we were supposed to have like a keyboard here where we could type in whatever we want.  And I think we should still have that.  I think we should make a little commotion about it.  We've been telling XM in Washington for over a year, Don, get on this. 
[01:16:30]  There's a way you could just change the pad data every 15 seconds or so.  And then people, you know, then they could fast forward through tracks and stuff.  ONA 1.  ONA 2.  ONA 3.  Every 15 seconds or whatever.  E-Rock.  Right.  E-Rock 1.  And you're like, oh, I listened to ONA 1.  I need ONA 3 and 5 and 6 or whatever today.  Right.  You know?  Instead of having to go through an hour and a half of the show.  Right.  And unfortunately, you can't fast forward through the content yet. 
[01:17:00]  Not yet.  But if it was in like 15-minute blocks, that makes it so much more user-friendly.  What about the new units coming out in March?  Maybe they have that.  Maybe they have.  I can't wait to get one of those, by the way.  I know.  So we've got to work on the pad data.  I mean, we've been getting a lot of email and people have been discussing it on the fan sites.  It's just time to take care of that immediately.  A couple things, Anthony, before we break.  Family Guy, Randy Newman, we found it.  Wow.  That Patrice was talking about.  Who found that?  Who found it? 
[01:17:30]  Who found the Family Guy audio?  E-Rock.  It was the episode when...  Was it E-Rock?  Why is Travis shaking his head?  E-Rock just raised his hand that he found it and everyone's shaking their head saying,  no, it was Danny.  No, I gave it to Danny.  Wait, wait, wait.  They love taking credit for good stuff.  All I know is I'll tell you what happened on our end.  All right.  Patrice went off on the whole Randy Newman singing a song as the action is happening in front of him or whatever on Family Guy.  It's the episode when it's the end of the world and Stewie turns into a little octopus. 
[01:18:00]  Yeah.  And they just were walking and then they found this beautiful place in this destroyed world where it was apples and delicious things going on.  But Randy Newman was there singing.  So they just said, fuck it, we're out.  We're just going to keep walking the terrain after Randy Newman.  Oh, because Randy wanted to sing about the action that was unfolding.  Okay, gotcha.  Randy's singing style is just like he's standing there looking around singing about anything he's seeing. 
[01:18:30]  Oh, that's hilarious.  So I whispered as you brought that up to E-Rock, I said, find that.  That's all I know.  And then he found it and then you told Danny where it was and then Danny.  Oh, okay.  So we're getting a retraction to the laughter in that room.  All right.  All right.  That's how it went down.  E-Rock.  Now we got to point E-Rock.  All right.  Here it is.  It's a quickie.  Peter, we found a new home.  What are you talking about?  We're going to Natick.  For what?  A Twinkie factory that might not even exist anymore? 
[01:19:00]  She's right.  Besides, this place is paradise.  Sure is.  Except for Randy Newman.  Randy Newman.  Yep.  Just sits there all night and day singing about what he sees.  Fat man with his kids and dog.  Drove in through the morning fog.  Hey there, Rover.  Come on over.  Well, it's nice to have music while we eat. 
[01:19:30]  Red-headed lady reaching for an apple.  Going to take a bite.  Nope.  Nope.  She's going to breathe on his voice.  Wipes it on her blouse.  She takes a bite.  Chews it once.  Twice.  Three times.  Four times.  Stops.  The lab awakens. 
[01:20:00]  Takes a long heart.  Look at Randy.  Five times.  Fat old husband walking over.  Let's get the hell out of here.  And they're walking down the road.  Left foot.  Right foot.  Left foot.  Right foot.  Left foot.  Left foot.  Right foot.  Left foot.  Right foot.  Left foot.  Right foot.  Left foot.  Left foot.

[01:28:30]  You're checking out the Opie and Anthony program on XM Satellite Radio  We are the pioneers of satellite radio  And we don't give a shit  Someone bitched that that was a long break?  Go fuck yourself  Ban him  We went an hour and a half  We went an hour and a half without a break  And now it's seven minutes after that hour and a half  These guys are getting spoiled 
[01:29:00]  Don't ban him  Take your XM  Don't ban him  Splash it down the toilet  And go fuck your mother  Don't ban him  Jimmy Norton  Speaking of Jimmy, a little later in the program  We got this bit where somebody redid a Norton bit  Well, it's not even a bit  It was just Norton losing it on a phone caller  And they redid the bit with some kid doing Jim's lines  It's great  Absolutely great  But first we gotta say hi to Bill Burr  Billy Burr 
[01:29:30]  Enter in the program  Hello  Bill Burr  Yes, Bill  William Burr  Someone's saying you can get mono just from being lazy and depressed  Oh, they're listening to us?  You just get it  And they're listening to us?  Yeah  They heard what we were saying?  Mm-hmm  Yeah, well, I've had the flu for like a week and a half  Yeah, the show goes on even when  I forgot  Even when we're off and in commercial break  Some people can still hear us  Yeah, it's the Pal Talk thing that's blowing up, right?  If you're on Pal Talk, yeah  Go to Pal Talk  We got what, two cameras now? 
[01:30:00]  One in the office and one in here?  I forget now  Office cam, studio cam  So people can hear what you're saying  And we're going to add more cams  How much does that cost a month?  Three commercials  Um  Uh, let me see  I don't know as a member  I'm hosting a room  And I know it costs me $90 a month just to put this on  Out of my own pocket, motherfuckers  I have to sort through emails in MySpace and things like that every night about  Dude, just another way to milk the listener, huh?  Because, you know, you've got to sign up  And I think it's something like $40 or $60 a year 
[01:30:30]  Depending on, like, what type of service you want  $60 a year  Alright, I understand there's very poor people out there that can't swing it  I'm sorry  But they're accusing me of actually making money on this  When I'm paying, like, $90 a month  Just to keep this thing going  We're not doing it to make more money  No, I just figured people wanted to kind of peek in on it  We're just trying to enhance the listening experience for people  And it's kind of defensive  And then it's up to you  Very defensive  To decide how far you want to go for the show  Because if you fielded so many emails on a nightly basis about how 
[01:31:00]  Dude, so, how's the pal talk checks coming in?  Hey, making money off the listeners like that? No!  And I know I pay  No ass  So that people have the privilege of watching this  It didn't sound like Herman Edwards before he left the Jets  Right  Yeah  You think I make money?  And besides  I love what I do, man  Besides, it's the audible.com checks we're getting  Right  The new head coach 
[01:31:30]  Get it straight  Know your facts  It's the audible.com checks  You think I knew that the stocks for pal talk was going to go up a million percent?  You think?  I have no clue  Bullshit!  I have no  No  Anyway, so I was talking to Bill  Getting myself a little tea  And he's like, said something like  Hey, good to see you  I'm like, yeah, this fucking flu has been a drag, you know  He goes, I gotta tell you  I was scared you had mono  I'm like, what?  He goes, yeah, one of the  What's the story?  One of the interns  I believe back a few weeks ago 
[01:32:00]  During Emilio's last week  I think he had mono  And I was afraid he might have had that  Wait, wait, you think he might have had mono, Dr.  Jesus Christ  He said he had mono  Can you sue for saying that I'm a fucking kind of disease that he doesn't have?  This whole thing is unraveling  It really is  I think I might have heard  Or maybe I dreamed it  Rumor had it  That I think I had mono?  Can you not say I have  He's like, oh shit, why am I on the air?  I just want to have a little small talk with you  I think Emilio 
[01:32:30]  Emilio was, he tested positive for HIV  I know this  I think that's why he was itchy  Oh my god  Oh my god  Who do you think had mono?  Emilio?  Before you left  I think he spread it around  He used to kiss the donuts  And licked all the empty cups  So I'm spitting on the Starbucks machine nozzle  The Starbucks machine? 
[01:33:00]  He just, he went underneath  He was just spitting into it  Yeah, he was drinking out of it  Like a water fountain  Drinking out the hot coffee machine  I saw Emilio drinking out the hot coffee machine  Now what did you say?  No, it's just that after Emilio's internship was up  He's like, yeah, I had to end earlier  So I had mono and I got really sick  And then Opie was sick for a week with a sore throat  And I know that's how mono starts  It starts with a sore throat? 
[01:33:30]  Yeah  It could last for, what, six to eight months?  Something like that  I got really sick with mono  And it makes you really tired  How are you feeling, Opie?  I think blueberries is a cure for that  I heard that  What are some of the other symptoms?  Sore throat  Steel-plated cheerio  Diarrhea  Diarrhea, don't have  I didn't have that, thank God  A flu, constant flu  And you're tired  And, uh, yeah  Tired  Sleeping like a motherfucker lately  Swollen glands  I had a mono  Swollen glands  That could be the flu  Yeah, I had mono a year ago, uh, October 
[01:34:00]  And I got really sick  I went down to, like, 119 pounds  I was  Would you fucking  It sounds like you gained weight  Yeah, I know now  I know, we're all looking at him, like, sizing up  Like, well, damn, you're not much over 119 right now  Motherfucker  I thought mono was, like, a cute disease  I first heard it in, like, um, Happy Days  Like, you got mono  Yeah, it's like a junior high disease  Yeah, that was some cute shit  You get from kissing  From doing little kisses behind the gymnasium  Yeah, that meant you were getting so 
[01:34:30]  Yeah, yeah, it was cool, that mono  Dude, I got mono  Kissing disease, they call it  And I just know it's highly contagious, so  Yeah, that's why I thought that at first  Alright, I don't have mono  You didn't give it to anybody when you had it?  Uh, no  I was just really fucking sick  Was he just looking at, like, the symptoms of mono?  Oh, great  Oh, fucking  Erock punched it up  Dr. Erock punched it up  On his medical, uh  That shit's the best  You look up the symptoms for any disease  Like, I don't know  Ass, jeez  Diarrhea  Soft  Oh, ass, jeez 
[01:35:00]  What does it mean  Plus  Sore throat  Plus  Right  Diarrhea  Plus  Sweating  It sends you to some gay fucking porn site  Doesn't matter what you put in a goddamn search engine  It could be anything from the cold to HIV  Oh, great  Thanks for going down, man  Go to webmd.com  And be the biggest hypochondriac  You have everything  It comes on  Opie, is that you asking?  You ain't got mono, nigga  Get off this  Yeah, you go on those sites 
[01:35:30]  You're like, alright, good news  I don't have mono  But damn, I think I got these three or four diseases  I got it  Good news  90% of diseases involve, like, sweating, diarrhea  Right, right  Fatigue  Muscle pain and fatigue  I got cancer  I feel great  How the fuck did I get the sickle cell?  I'm not black  All of a sudden you're convinced that you got some shit  Like, what?  Mommy  Mom  Have you been fucking somebody black?  Because I think I got sickle celled in here  Right  No, sweetie  Only black people get that 
[01:36:00]  You have a sore throat or throat cancer  Alright, that's good  Can I get a flow chart here that I can run through?  That's the culture of men  We do not go to the fucking doctor  Like, women, they just check  Just any little thing, they go to the doctor  Dude, I am not going to the fucking doctor  Once you break the seal, though, then you go  And you got it  It's one of those things you just got it  Thank you, Bill  It's ridiculous  Thanks for making me wonder if I'm lying  I just always look the same like  When I used to have a car 
[01:36:30]  Oh, sorry  Sorry  It's just like you go to a mechanic  They're going to find something  They'll find something  Or they need to make money  They will find something wrong  Right  You just got to hope it's not that bad  And everybody is up to the finger up the ass phase  If you go to the doctor  So  You're all up to that finger up the ass phase  Oh, I'm putting that off  Did you do it?  I'm putting it off  You didn't do it yet?  No  I'm surprised  Nah, you know if you didn't do it  I didn't do it  You're up to that  You're more apt to have a finger up my ass than you are  No, just white guy timing 
[01:37:00]  It's just like a white guy's going to fucking do it before a black dude  Six months ago, first time ever  Broke my cherry  What, the thing in the booty?  Oh, the moon river moment  The moon river moment  Sometimes I can't  Now I got to get it  I think it's enlarged  Because I got to piss like a motherfucker sometimes  It's just like  And I try to hold it  Really?  It comes out  I got to have somebody stick some of them  Oh, boy  If you're fucking a lot  Oh, boy  Let's look at it  You're jerking off a lot  Then you should be fine  You're fucking a lot?  Jerking off a lot  Not as much  No?  Because I take these pills 
[01:37:30]  I still jerk off sometimes  Peace, I go to a real doctor  Rather than listen to a radio DJ  Hey, we know a little bit about it  He really  He really was coming with me  With this official  I got all serious  For a minute  And I was like  Doctor, yeah  Well, I should have  Let me diagnose you on WebMD here  Have you been masturbating a lot lately?  You should be fine  I think we could talk normal language here  What I got?  Cancer?  Not anymore  Oh, shit  Oh, fuck  First DJ sued for malpractice  Bill, I'd like to stay out of this 
[01:38:00]  There is a patient doctor privilege here  That you are not privy to  I'm over here in the waiting room  Pipe that in, by the way  Masturbates a lot  And sweats a lot  Let's see what it comes out of me  Jim Norton  You have Jim Norton disease  You have Norditis  Yeah, Norditis  Let's go to Mark  Mark, what's up?  Jim-itis  What's going on, Opie?  Hey  Hey, man  You're a hypochondriac or what, man?  Every time I turn on the radio, you're sick, brother  What's going on, man? 
[01:38:30]  No, I've been pretty good, actually  I've had a rough  I've had a rough like  All right, thanks  I can't talk over you, so  Yeah, man  Let's go there  If you're a hypochondriac, you always think you're sick  If he calls every time you are sick  It was bad  It was bad  It was bad  It was really sick  Anthony?  I was really sick, then  Dr. Kumier?  Are we conferring with each other?  Are we having a little comfort?  I concur with your findings, Dr. Burr?  I don't think Patrice has enlarged prostate  I think I'll prescribe a little jerking off 
[01:39:00]  I'm prescribing some jerking off  Where's my prescription?  I'm going to write down  Anthony, Anthony  Jerk off twice a day as needed  This is good doctor, bad doctor  One says jerk off  The other one says  Look at fat boy  You got to do sit-ups, push-ups, and eat right  Fuck that, Nick  I'm jerking off  I'm going with this other doctor  This prescription is real  Check an opinion  Check my dick  Alright, listen  We got to move on  You know what?  This is amazing  But because we lost about a week of radio 
[01:39:30]  We still haven't gotten to the Emily Stern remixes  No  We had just started doing this  And Opie fell deathly ill  With what I diagnosed  And we have sound clips that we did not get to  Ah, no  Well, the remixes are coming in like crazy  We got about 15 to 20 so far  And 10 of them are worth playing, believe it or not  Wow, that's a great average for our listeners  Because usually you guys stink on ice  You want to set this up once again?  They suck  Well, Howie's little girl, Emily Stern 
[01:40:00]  Remember that burning the bridge thing we were talking about about a half hour ago?  You might want to sit out this next hour  It's amazing  You might want to  It's the toughest thing  You might want to sit out this next hour  Can I be honest with you motherfuckers, man?  Alright  I  When you guys were going to do Stern twice, right?  Yeah  He's one of my  Growing up  One of my favorite motherfuckers in the world  I won't deny that  I made a decision like  Okay  ONA's my motherfuckers  I'm not doing Stern or whatever  But when you  You know  You guys trash him 
[01:40:30]  I want to not be a pussy  And just come in  Yeah, you motherfucking phony  I'm going to kick  And you know what?  I'm going to whoop  What's the sidekick?  I shouldn't remember tonight  Because I like the motherfucker  Artie  Artie  I'll fuck you up too, Artie  Like  I want to do that shit  Enjoy him  I'm like  You guys  You guys fuck with his daughter  You know what it is?  I understand  You don't have a problem or issues with the guy  Not to the  I have no problem with that 
[01:41:00]  We do  Right off the bat  We do  The guy was a fucking asshole  We actually talked about that on the phone one night  The awkwardness of that moment  It is very awkward  When you sit here and Opie and Anthony  It's just like  Yeah, the guy never really did anything to me  Yeah, he opens the day to help  He put me on  He was cool  And you're like  And you're sitting on  That motherfucker  And I'm like  Faggot  I'm going to kick you  Oh, you  And jump it up  Oh, you liar  And I'm sitting there like  Doodly-deed-deed  Got my phone 
[01:41:30]  I should take this  Pull a Hannity  Pull a fucking Hannity  I'll be right back over you  I'll be standing up  You cock  Fuck  My doctor told me to jerk off  I'll be right back  Well, the latest was when he said  He would never stand in anyone's way  As far as making it clear for himself  I lost my fucking mind  Oh, you pussy  The shit he pulled behind the scenes  And then he has the balls to say that  There are comics  I wouldn't fuck with anyone's career  There are comics  That are like  That hate other comics 
[01:42:00]  One of these  Is Joe Rogan  And  Oh, yeah  So we can relate to what you guys are saying  Carlos Mencia  And Joe Rogan  I have no problem with Carlos  Rogan hates  Carlos Mencia  Right  And we had fun with  Rogan  Talking about Carlos  Here on the show  It was a lot of fun  Rogan's a fucking animal  I love him  He digs in  He don't give a shit  And it's great to listen to  Then a couple of weeks later  We had Carlos come on  And people are trashing 
[01:42:30]  Like  Dude, why aren't you ripping apart Carlos?  And  The truth of the matter is  Carlos never did anything to me  Right  Never did anything bad  So I didn't jump on the  Bass Carlos train  This is not a thing  But I'm not gonna  But I'm not gonna  Like tell Joe  Hey, Joe  You know, calm down on Carlos  The guy obviously has a fucking problem  With Carlos  I'm still  Not sure what it is  Joe's a psychopath  I know that  It was fun to listen to  It was very fun to listen to  But I don't have a problem with him  So I'm not gonna jump on it  But I'm not gonna stop Joe from doing it 
[01:43:00]  You have loyalties  But it's like  You're not sworn in  Like it will be  He goes  Alright, Patrice  Come and me talk to you, man  Off air  Yeah  I need you to go shoot Robin in the face  Dude  Right  That could  Be a problem  You don't have to  You wanna sell out helium this weekend  Yeah  Yeah, Cup of Cheese's whole  Big beard Philly thing  Oh, done  Done  I'm sick of hearing that thing anyway  About the damn big beards in Philly  Yeah  Anyway  Maybe I'm getting sick of it 
[01:43:30]  Maybe I'm not  Maybe I'm not  See what I'm saying  So let's  So let's acknowledge that  Bill Burr and Patrice O'Neill are in studio  And they may or may not be  Uncomfortable with the next segment  That's fine  Right  But we have to go there  Because this is too good for the radio  You can feel free to join in  Or sit and watch  You will sit here  And we'll judge your rage  Okay  See who is more annoyed  No, not  By Howard Stern  No, we got the rage out of us  Yeah, now it's just funny  Now this is just funny 
[01:44:00]  It's irony  Is what this is  It's ironic  That a man who built his career  Bringing whores into his studio  Doing things like  Throwing baloney on their asses  Raiding their bodies  On a scale of 1 to 10  Berating them  Having them show their tits  Have them do sexual things  Just all those things  It's ironic  That his little girl  His daughter  One of the first forays  Into the public world  She decides to take 
[01:44:30]  Is a nude role  In a Jewish play  Where she takes the stage  Very scantily clad for most of it  And then at the end  Disropes  And how he was  A little upset by this  Whether he really  Said how upset he was  On Larry King  And other interviews  I don't know  I don't think he did  I don't think he was honest there  I think any father  Whose 22 year old daughter  Wants to be an actress  And your career 
[01:45:00]  Is Howard Stern  Would be upset at this  You don't want it  Being your daughter  You never want it  Being your daughter  So it was brought to our attention  And well we got some audio  Of her doing her thing  Yeah  I think we should just play  The audio of her first  Well just part of it  Part of it  It goes on and on  The play sounds like  The worst piece of drivel  It really is an awful play  It's a Jewish theater group  I'm loving you 
[01:45:30]  Just sitting in judgment  I'm not sitting in judgment  It's just awkward  It's funny  It's fucking funny  But it's like  You know what the funny thing is  No matter what happens  We're a part of the Opie and Anthony show  And eventually Stern is going to say  That fat fuck  Fat fuck  Fat fuck  And I'm going to be like  Dude he didn't even call you by name  When you were on there  But that's the reason  I'm going to tell you  But be very honest  I'm going to give you a little more respect  On this fucking program  I'm going to be honest with you  I'm honest

[02:20:30]  Ha, ha, ha, ha.  You won't fucking look funny.  The last one for today.  The last one for today.  The last one for today.  All right. 
[02:21:00]  Because personally, I think the pests can do better.  Yes.  I think they can too.  The audio is up on opianthony.com, and we'll look forward to hearing more of your remixes.  Yeah.  This is the ghost of Fatty Arbuckle.  I'm in trouble.  My breasts, my breasts, my shoulder in the car.  My breasts, my white shining legs, my time now. 
[02:21:30]  I've learned so much.  That was pretty good.  God damn.  Jesus.  There you go.  All right.  There you go. 
[02:22:00]  That was good.  No, that was...  And then we're back.  That was good.  There's nothing wrong with that.  I'm going to open just slap it down like, ah, my baby.  Ah, yeah.  Jesus.  Listeners did us good today.  We're proud of you.  Very proud.  But I think they can do better.  A little better.  A little better, I'm thinking.  All right.  Ah.  Just let that sink in a little bit. 
[02:22:30]  Just let it sink in.  Let's say hi to Ben's raw ass.  Ben's raw ass.  What's up?  Hey, boys.  I just wanted to stay, like, really not on the same topic, but the whole...  There's a free paper out here called the Long Island Press.  I don't know if you guys read it.  There's a whole article about you boys and about Stern.  And for all the other people who want to play along, there's longislandpress.com.  The whole article's up there, too, so...  Ooh.  Yeah, the article's pretty good, but the guy got a bunch of facts wrong, unfortunately.  But that's what happens in every article we do. 
[02:23:00]  Yeah, but he kind of gave you guys props.  No, it's a good article, definitely.  It's definitely a good article.  All right, cool.  Punch it on, man.  Thanks.  All right.  I guess they threw us on the cover, too.  There's some kind of, like, cartoon character thing on the cover.  Character.  So...  How long is that going to be out there, by the way?  Probably a month.  Oh, okay.  Yeah, in the article, it says that I come from, like, a large Italian-Irish family.  Yeah.  That's just a minor point.  But then he talks about how... 
[02:23:30]  This is too inside, I guess, but how Infinity Broadcast was going to throw us back on the  air after the same past thing if we agreed to the stipulation that we don't talk about  Howard or any current or past Infinity Employees.  That isn't right.  No, they want us to sign that so we can work for another company.  Anywhere else.  To work anywhere else.  Yeah, they didn't want us working for them again.  If we signed that piece of paper, then they would let us out of the contract.  Right.  Not to put us back on the air with them.  Right. 
[02:24:00]  That's kind of a big detail that he missed.  Very.  So, besides that, the article's pretty good.  It's a good read.  All right.  We'll take a break.  We got Patrice O'Neill in studio and Bill Burr.  Bill, are you promoting anything?  Yeah.  I'm going to be at...  What is it?  Why are you pointing?  The Stress Factory, because I'm trying to remember.  Oh, okay.  I was reading your big article in the Long Island Times Journal.  Jesus.  I get delivered to my apartment every day. 
[02:24:30]  It's non-fiction.  It's a novel.  Oh, holy shit.  I know.  This is very long.  Yeah, we're going to be at the Stress Factory.  We've fallen down a few rungs, by the way.  We used to have fucking huge articles and much bigger publications.  You know, you've got to start climbing that ladder somewhere.  We're now taking those interview requests we used to say no to.  Yeah, sure.  What time?  When can you be here?  We'll be here.  We'll wait.  We'll wait for you.  Yeah, sure.  We'll wait for you.  Are you showing up?  There was a time we could pick and choose our articles. 
[02:25:00]  Now it's like, what?  Anyone who wants to interview us.  You write for a college newspaper?  Sure.  Sure.  We'll be here.  What are the words?  You have a blog.  We're willing to do blog interviews.  How many people check out your blog every day?  A hundred.  Okay, sure.  We'll do a lot of hits.  A lot of hits today.  Hey, it's worth it.  Hi, this is Jim from the Church Street International Pamphlet.  I was wondering if we could interview.  Is that a one-fold or a two-fold pamphlet? 
[02:25:30]  Because we only do two-fold pamphlets.  It's always either the world-famous or the international.  That's when you know nobody's ever heard of it.  The world-famous.  We'll even do interviews for publications that have staples to keep their paper together.  Oh, what?  You mean a staple in the upper corner?  A staple in the upper left corner?  If you use a stapler for your articles and those Jesus things? 
[02:26:00]  Yeah.  That homeless paper?  People say no thank you to an article.  Yeah, no.  No thanks, man.  No, no, no.  It's the Church Street International Pamphlet.  Pamphlet and newsletter.  No, no.  It's a news-da-news.  It's a newsletter.  Oh, crap.  All right, we'll go to break and we'll continue.  What do you got?  Oh, no, no.  We'll just go over to Derek.  Thanks, Derek.  It's the worst of the O.P. and Anthony F.U.I. 
[02:26:30]  Fuck everyone.  Fuck you.  Fuck you.  Fuck you.  Hey, Diamond Dave.  Checking in with a big F.U. to you guys.  I heard you that were on the replay yesterday because you guys are just trashing me left and  right.  Give Dave FM a champ.  After all, it's free.  And I'm taking free FM to the doctor.  I ain't going nowhere. 
[02:27:00]  Free FM is here to stay.  And if not, I don't give a fuck.  I can't clear.  Yeah, here's a big, hearty, heartfelt, warm fuck you and your mother and your sister  all in the ass through all the fucking wrong lives I fucking work with.  Here's a newsflash.  My days of bending over backwards to bail you lazy, half-wicked, incompetent motherfuckers  are over.  That's right, fuckers.  You do your own fucking work.  And if you fuck up, guess what? 
[02:27:30]  I am going to the boss.  You can call me a snitch, a bitch, or whatever the fuck you want.  I am sick of the half-wits I have to fucking work with.  Fuck all of you.  Don't just drink Guzzle from the fucking bucket of AIDS.  Take a dry concrete one up the fucking ass sideways and blow me.  I am sick of all of your fucking shit.  There's a big fuck you to the lady in front of me right now on the freeway in Cleveland,  Ohio.  Just because 70 miles an hour is faster than you normally drive, cunt, doesn't mean you 
[02:28:00]  drive it fast enough to be in the passing lane.  So fuck you, use your blinker, and take a right turn into that fucking pole, please.  Fuck all y'all!  Call the O.P. and Anthony F.U. line at 866-FU-LINE-1.  That's 866-FU-LINE-1.  Fuck you!  Fuck you!  Fuck you!  Yeah, fuck him.  That's an urban myth. 
[02:28:30]  I've never confirmed that with anybody.  Man, I was hoping we could hear the whole song.  Little tool never hurt anyone.  We're back with the Opinante program.  It's going to be tough with the music, though.  Bill Byrne's studio, Patrice O'Neal. 
[02:29:00]  Want to say hi to Dirty Landscaper.  Dirty Landscaper, what's up?  Hey, what's going on?  Hey, man.  I just called to say thank you, guys.  I fucking love you.  I've been fucking pushing snow for three days.  These dirty motherfuckers that called at the last minute to get these jobs done are unbelievable.  I'm so tired, but if it wasn't for you guys, Norton, your antics, I love you, man.  Norton.  Thanks, dude.  I appreciate it, guys.  I'm punching out.  You guys have a great week.  You punch out, my friend. 
[02:29:30]  Yeah, you might need a good night's sleep.  Dude, thank you, man.  I might.  I'm actually a friend of Cute the Cops.  All right, well.  Once in a while, I think about calling, you know, to say hi and punching in, but, you  know, I don't want a ball to use, you know.  Dude, this is Jimmy, man.  Thank you, man.  You just hung up?  We interrupt this program.  Ozone Nidget Sighting of the Day.  Whoa, we haven't had one of these in a while.  Let's say hi to Brian in Washington.  Brian, what's up?  What's going on, fellas? 
[02:30:00]  Hey, Brian.  Hey, guy.  I'm a repo, dude.  I just had a midget sight.  Actually, I repoed a fucking midget's car, man.  And I'm pulling off with the fucking car.  I see this little person at the fucking hot dog stand.  This fucking guy's running to me.  I act like I don't see him.  I'm pulling off.  This motherfucking little midget's hand is beating on my fucking window, man.  It was just un-fucking-believable.  Dude, did you tow it or drive it away?  Oh, no.  I towed it.  I let him get his shit out of the car and his handicap pass. 
[02:30:30]  And I said, what happened?  You're a little short on your payment?  Short on your payment.  Does he have, like, long pedals and shit?  Yeah, are the pedals?  Actually, it was a fucking Prius.  The guy was about four or three.  He wasn't a midget midget, but it did, man.  It was funny.  Oh, that's really good.  Wow.  Thank you, Brian.  Hey, no problem, guys.  You're welcome.  All right.  Meanwhile, back at the show.  Does he understand he made a joke? 
[02:31:00]  I don't know.  Was he trying to make a joke or was he just saying he was a little short on his payment?  No, he was trying to make a joke.  He was?  Yeah.  All right.  He definitely was trying to make a little short on his payment.  A little short on his payment.  It is no coincidence like that in the world, man.  Okay.  It is.  It is.  It is.  But it will boom.  It is.  It is something.  Blackburn, we never sound good, like doing a timing joke.  It's so hard.  It's like, what was your little short on your payment?  Splat!  It's like, hey, yo.  Splat!  We got to go back home and then get, yo, what was that fucking short on the payment? 
[02:31:30]  That shit was corny.  That's the money.  The fuck is up with that book or shit?  No, I was just having fun of Ovi and Anthony.  Shut the fuck up, yo.  Why are you listening to them?  This is no cracker.  Racist motherfucker.  Hey, Bill, Las Vegas, what's up?  Bill.  Oh, I wanted to ask Patrice a question.  I've heard his friends meeting Martin and Sarah talk about him burning bridges all the  time.  I was wondering if you wanted to elaborate on that.  Yeah, I burned, it's, it's, look, it's, it's, uh, it's, uh, it's, it's, sometimes it's a mistake, 
[02:32:00]  sometimes it's not, like, uh, I burned one with Spike Lee and, uh, I, that ain't a bad  bridge to burn.  That, I, fuck that, but it was like, it burned itself.  It's like, sometime I walk away, I have toilet paper shoes.  Self-burning bridge.  Yeah, and somebody, it's a toilet paper bridge, um, uh, uh, uh, match, match sneakers and fucking,  you know, and it's like, here's sometimes, now here's one that's not my fault.  You fucking tell me. 
[02:32:30]  Now, we're in show business, Spike, he wanted me to come, uh, read, audition for the show,  or for the show you had on, on Showtime.  Now, Showtime was the people I, when I first did my first half hour special, I, these motherfuckers  offered me a deal, right, said I was good, and then they said, you know what, we're gonna  take the deal away, and not only are we gonna take it away, we're gonna tell you, you'll  never be a leading man in this business, you stink.  So I said, fuck you, right, so he did that on Showtime, so he said, I want you to come  out, he, he was a fan of mine, I want you to come out, and, and read for this part on 
[02:33:00]  Showtime, I said, man, I can't do that, I can't come out and audition for Showtime,  I tell you what, audition everybody you want, if I fucking, if you don't find them, then  I'll come out.  He goes, nah, do it, man, do it.  I go, I can't.  I said, first of all, though, why are you calling me?  Like, you don't fucking call me to tell me to do that.  He, he, it's like he called my agents, then he called me.  To say, hey, man, your agent said you're not gonna do it. 
[02:33:30]  I go, Spike, you don't fucking call me, like, you don't call me on the fucking phone.  Wait, wait, Spike, you don't call me?  Like, I, cause I can't say no to Spike, like.  No, he's not, he's not, like, how it works, is even though he's Spike Lee, the proper channels  you're supposed to take, is you're supposed to, like, the agent's supposed to be the bad  guy.  So, so when Patrice goes, listen, I can't do it, just tell it, then the agent's gotta  be like, okay, I gotta call Spike Lee. 
[02:34:00]  Yeah, Patrice doesn't wanna do it.  So he's just sitting in his house, eating, you know, fucking chilling out, watching TV,  and all of a sudden the phone rings.  And Spike muscle me.  Probably thinks it's boss or whatever.  And all of a sudden it's like, hey, it's Spike Lee.  He's like, hey, it's Spike or something, man.  Yeah, talk to your agent.  I'm like, you cannot fucking call me.  Like, if you go, if Steven Spielberg calls your house and he goes, hey, listen, I want  you to do this movie, um, you're gonna do it for free, and I'm gonna make you look like  a fucking idiot.  And you go, well, Steve.  You know what you say? 
[02:34:30]  Yes.  Thank you, sir, for calling.  No, no, fuck you, don't, nigga.  If none of you are in the business, and this is my problem.  It's Spielberg.  I think I'm in the business.  Spike Lee?  That's what happened.  And, sir, in a nutshell, I guess that's why I burned bridges, because I think I'm in the  fucking business.  So I tell Spike, don't call me.  Call my people.  And he goes, aight.  And I never heard from you.  That was the last thing you heard from Spike Lee was, aight.  I could love Spike Lee if you hung up.  You're like, do the 18th lead in my movie just say, call my people? 
[02:35:00]  I don't want Spike Lee calling me directly.  And he gave me three things that I made the most money I ever made in my life.  The end, not the end to cut, the 24th hour, this is how you gave me the role.  He goes, he was interviewing me.  He goes, you like the Knicks?  I go, nah, the Celtics.  He goes, aight, yeah, and that's how you gave me the fucking role in the 25th hour.  And he said, I got a voice over for you.  You want it?  Yeah.  Thousands of fucking dollars, right? 
[02:35:30]  I'm sitting there shaking in my balls.  Don't call me.  Going, why Spike?  There's a story behind this.  I don't want to do this.  It has nothing to do with you.  Nah, do it for me.  Do it for me.  That's when you do the favor for the guy who is entrenched in the business.  You do a favor for him.  Okay, motherfuckers.  It's all right.  Now I know, bitches.  But that's one.  Spike on the phone.  We'll work this out for you.  That's one of 10,000 fucking bridge burning. 
[02:36:00]  So it's not like bridge burning.  It's more just bad decisions.  And three weeks later going, wait a minute.  What did I do?  One of the big reasons comics hate me and I don't care, but I just do it.  And Bill suffered a couple of ones because we were sweet.  Oh, I know this one.  It's going over.  You don't get the fuck off the stage.  I just go over.  And fucking, I just, last week DC, I came out of retirement, went down to the strip, went over my time.  DC Benny just comes up to me and goes, what did I ever fucking do to you? 
[02:36:30]  Oh, and he is the worst when he goes over because he either acts like he has no idea or he just completely denies it.  It's like, Patrice, do seven minutes and he comes off 32 minutes later.  And you're like, Patrice, you just did a fucking half hour.  And he goes, that was a half hour?  No, it was a half hour.  I did a half hour.  Bill, for real.  That was a half hour? 
[02:37:00]  Acting like he's completely flabbergasted.  You know me, you know the time better than I do.  I didn't see the light.  And then like fucking turning it on and off.  They're cutting out the mic.  Man, it was 8,000 people in the theater.  All those lighters and shit.  I didn't know what the light was.  I went over at Lincoln Center and built in the back like fucking God.  The joke about Patrice is like whatever amount of time he's supposed to do, that's how long his closing bit's going to be.  So if you say, Patrice, do 20 minutes, that means he's going to do about like, you know, probably like 17, 18 before he gets into his 20 minute closing pussy joke or whatever the fuck he's going to do. 
[02:37:30]  And then I nod my head like I'm finishing up.  Oh, I see it.  Yeah, I see the light.  I do see it.  Hey, we got Bill from Pal Talk.  He has an urgent communique to Anthony.  Yes, Bill.  Yeah.  Everybody turn on sex by girl.  She's flashing.  Friggin' retard is flashing.  Yeah.  What's going on?  People have told me to pull this woman's camera up. 
[02:38:00]  All right.  And I've pulled it up.  And I don't know.  She appears to, I, look, I don't know what's going on there.  But she apparently is flashing.  And it's on, it's on Pal Talk.  So, you know, there's a few hundred people in this room checking her out.  But she doesn't seem right.  Oh, my God.  Is that big mama there?  She looks like Terry Shivo if she lived.  Right.  Oh, shit.  And she was just flashing.  What, were you guys getting her to flash?  Yeah, she's flashed a couple times. 
[02:38:30]  We're trying to get her to play What's in My Pants.  Her vagina.  Wow.  That's Terry Shivo if they could figure out how to knock her out of that silly coma she was in.  Oh, my God.  Look at the difference.  You can pop up like Attractive Girl and then that.  Ah, life.  It's a big...  What is she doing?  I'm I.  What is she doing?  What's her story?  All she does is just sit there in the corner and stare at the screen. 
[02:39:00]  And then every once in a while she'll stand up and show her this.  What's in the background?  Is that like a wheelchair?  I can't really.  I see a wheelchair or some type of wheeled medical device in the background.  Can she talk?  What's her deal?  Oh, shit.  That is a wheelchair.  She's in a nursing home.  Is she?  No way.  Yeah, that's a nursing home.  Great.  We're getting nursing home women on our fucking webcams.  That is fantastic. 
[02:39:30]  We have her camera up and she doesn't even know we're talking about her.  How do you get her to flash?  They've just been putting it up.  Show your tits.  Show your tits.  Well, her name is Sex...  Bi-Girl?  Yep.  Sex Bi-Girl.  So, obviously, she made the name for herself.  Well, or somebody did.  Or somebody did and what she accidentally logged on under that name.  Someone just wrote, even her tits are cross-eyed.  A Sex Bi-Girl.  Show us your tits. 
[02:40:00]  Here she goes.  All right, here she goes.  Here she goes.  She's going really slow.  Oh, my God.  She's going really, really slow.  All right.  This isn't right.  Which one's the titties?  What is she doing?  I swear to God, they look like two water balloons.  Holy shit.  Oh, that's the worst. 
[02:40:30]  Did she have a stroke?  It looks like her whole left side is fucked up.  Yeah, something's going on there.  It looks like she's got down.  Jesus Christ.  I don't know what's going on.  God, why are we bothering trying to be intelligent on this show?  These are our listeners.  Look at this.  Wow.  We're trying to get enough people up there.  Who's that?  Who's the nickname?  Michelin Mary?  Oh.  Oh, hey.  Hey, Sex Bi-Girl.  Let's see that ass.  No, that's all right.  That's, uh...  That's okay. 
[02:41:00]  Who the hell is she?  Does anyone know who this girl is?  Did she just, like, stumble on this room?  Anyone ever see her before?  I haven't.  No.  Wow.  That is something.  All right.  Well, thanks for the heads up, Bill.  I will say, Sonny Ferelli looks like he's going to have a stroke.  He's laughing so hard.  Yeah.  A lot of people are cracking up.  All right.  I hope someone's capturing that.  That's something.  Thanks, Bill.  All right.  Thanks for pal talk, Ant.  Yeah, pal talk is just another dimension of the O.P. and Anthony show.  Look what I've wrought. 
[02:41:30]  And these rooms don't even close anymore?  They're pretty much open all day?  24 hours a day, there's ONA fan rooms that have, you know, anywhere from 200 to 300 people in them.  Yeah.  They go on room raids.  Last night was an awful, awful racist night of invading Martin Luther King tribute rooms.  And they actually set up Martin Luther King, celebrate the life of Martin Luther King.  And it was in that, like, they set up a room like that and waited for people to come in. 
[02:42:00]  And then, like, someone will just pop on camera wearing a Klan hood.  It was some of the most heinous, hysterical shit.  Uh, that girl is now taking her pants off.  Oh, no.  Really?  All right, we'll pop it up.  She can barely stand.  She's going to fall over.  Oh, my God.  She's going to fall over.  Oh, my God.  Yeah, it looks like her left side is not, um, working.  Yeah, so she's having a tough time pulling her pants down. 
[02:42:30]  She just fell.  She just fell on her face.  What?  No, she can't.  Did she fall?  She spit.  Oh, no.  Yes.  There you go, pumpkin.  She's bending over.  She's got her ass right on cam.  Bare ass on her knees.  Oh, she's just crawling around like a fucking seal.  Oh, my God.  That isn't right.  Holy shit.  God bless her for being such a trooper. 
[02:43:00]  Holy God.  Oh, that was the hardest.  That was the most difficult doggy style getting into.  This is amongst the worst stuff I've ever been involved in.  She needed those rehabilitation poles and getting the doggy style.  Holy shit.  I can't believe.  Welcome back to the program, by the way.  Those parallel bar things that you walk.  This is. 
[02:43:30]  Oh, fuck.  I see the awful, terrible things.  All right.  We'll move on here.  That was good.  They always want to be.  They're having fun on Pal Talk once again today.  Very good, Bill.  I understand where you were going.  I want you to say, welcome back to the show.  You're an asshole.  I certainly did.  Welcome back to the show.  Oh, I didn't get that.  You took like an hour off there on us.  Oh, my God.  I wanted to take a beer.  What a cuck. 
[02:44:00]  You played an hour and a half with Emily Stern.  Was that at all?  Oh, my God.  I'm just helping you out to make sure that you had nothing to do with that show.  What an asshole.  It's my job.  Don't you get it yet?  Oh, you're funny, man.  Hey, we got audio of the mayor of New Orleans.  This is pretty good.  He's blaming God and stuff on the hurricanes.  Oh, shit.  Oh, boy.  Blaming God?  Oh, yeah.  He's doing a whole God thing.  Man.  And says, what does he say about New Orleans? 
[02:44:30]  How it's going to stay chocolate or something?  What was that one quote he had?  Oh, that's going to kill tourism.  If you blame God for a natural disaster, you can't really blame him for the ones that you  can track for, like, three weeks straight.  Right.  Like, here it comes.  Ah, that's fucking...  Here it comes.  Oh, God.  Can you just give a nigga a break and just let him blame God instead of going, yeah,  yeah.  God would...  Yeah, there you go.  I'm sure God...  I'm sure Noah had a six-week warning before...  Earthquakes, tsunami, things like that. 
[02:45:00]  You can blame God.  When you got fucking every weatherman on every channel going, this will be over your house  in a week.  Right.  In a week.  You can't really blame God.  You can blame the government officials.  You can blame the people that didn't leave.  You can blame the president.  You can blame...  God?  You got to leave God out of it.  You blame the fact that you live right in the Gulf of Mexico.  Right.  In the Gulf of Mexico.  Or, like...  In what would be the...  In what's supposed to be a part of the Gulf of Mexico.  All right.  Well, here's his clip.  It's very controversial today. 
[02:45:30]  A lot of people talk about this as well.  As we think about rebuilding New Orleans, surely God is mad at America?  He's sending hurricane after hurricane after hurricane.  And is destroying and putting stress on this country?  Surely he's not approval of us being in Iraq under false pretenses?  Holy shit.  All right. 
[02:46:00]  He lost his mind.  All right.  I'm giving him all the sympathy he needs.  He lost his mind.  He had a nervous breakdown and lost his fucking mind.  That is the mayor of New Orleans.  The pressure got to him.  Yeah.  When he first...  Remember when he first came on camera?  When we first knew who this guy was?  Didn't know who knew him from a hole in the wall.  And then the hurricane.  And you saw him talking.  And you're like, all right, this is the mayor.  Something's a little wacky about him.  But he's the mayor.  They voted him in.  Now, I haven't seen him in a while.  We see him now. 
[02:46:30]  Lost his fucking mind.  Right.  Completely insane.  He's lost his mind.  And wouldn't God want us to go into Iraq?  Our God would.  Wouldn't that be God's enemy that we're fighting?  Yes.  Like, wouldn't God want the entire stage to himself?  Opie, the real God.  Yes.  The real God.  The real God wants us there.  Right.  Not any of the fake gods that other people worship.  He doesn't want anyone confused that there may be some other higher being.  No.  So he would like us to do his dirty work.  To go in and destroy their God?  Their stupid, fake God? 
[02:47:00]  Yeah, he would.  God.  This is what kills.  This is what I never agree.  This is why God just.  I was watching that Passion of Christ.  And I'm just like, you know, why do people think God plays these games?  Why does God do these lesson things?  Like, it's just.  And tests and.  Kill the motherfucker who's evil.  Like, what is.  Just.  Boop.  You dead, nigga.  You dead.  But it's like.  Yeah.  What?  This game play.  It's like, no God didn't go.  It's gotta go through us. 
[02:47:30]  Attack this and destroy that.  And what?  Give him some, like, more respect than he.  Yeah.  I hate religion.  Oh, religion's the worst.  Like, God is a chokester.  I watched the 700 Club.  I was on the road.  And I'm like.  I'm gonna watch this.  I'll probably get a bit out of it.  And I just.  I watched it for 20 minutes.  And they had me scared shitless that I was going to hell.  That's how it works.  They had some guy who fell off a motorcycle.  And we go.  We're gonna be talking to Daryl in a few minutes.  Who was unconscious and went to hell.  Hear what that was like. 
[02:48:00]  I guess like.  After the.  Especially.  Like, he died for a few minutes.  He went to some scary place.  And then came back.  Came back.  Oh, yeah.  After we sell you.  That fixed him up.  Oh, yeah.  And then they basically show how these two people who had no fucking money.  But then sent them 20 bucks are now completely out of debt.  So.  Yeah.  That same half hour.  So if you send.  I've seen ads for the anointed cloth.  Like, I saw some couple.  And they were selling this anointed cloth that if you get it. 
[02:48:30]  You know.  And then they had testimony from these people that said.  I put it on my neck.  And my neck pain went away.  And it was great.  And my God.  I can't believe it.  My wrist used to hurt me for about two years.  I got the anointed cloth.  I put it on there.  And now I can do everything.  I can slap my wife again.  And it was like 20 bucks for this anointed cloth.  And I'm watching going.  Who is buying into this?  Who's buying into this?  Yeah.  A shitload of people.  Billions of motherfuckers.  Right.  Big shitload of people.  Benny Hinn.  Yeah.  Fucking, you know. 
[02:49:00]  TD Jakes.  Millions of motherfuckers go to see them every year.  Right.  Talk that God shit.  Yeah.  And people are horrified.  But I don't think God is this trivial dude that wants you to disco dance for him.  And throw money.  And just he's sitting up there.  Look at these motherfuckers.  They're on my dick.  You know what I mean?  It's like, no.  God is not this dude, man.  You don't stop.  That's the evil shit.  Not the evil shit, but that's the shit that gets you in trouble is going, God is going  to punish America.  Yeah.  He's mad at you.  He's, okay. 
[02:49:30]  All right.  Ready?  The God Almighty is going to punish America, right?  This evil country, right?  But he's just waiting for the proper time.  He's going to send signals first so that the good people leave.  They're going to understand.  I'm going to send a message.  And all these other countries are all so nice.  Like in Mexico, there's all these real, you know, all the politicians, they're all on  the level.  There's no corruption down there.  Only where evil.  The fucking worst, the most loving God countries are the ones that get fucked up. 
[02:50:00]  The most godly countries.  Iran.  A 9.0 earthquake.  Everybody died praying.  They were praying and dying.  Their whole existence is based on their religion, their government, the work they go to, their  daily schedule, all based on their God.  They hate money.  They hate this, Matt.  This earthly shit. 
[02:50:30]  But America, the evil empire, we're going to destroy it.  But systematically, we're just going, there's a little thing here, a little thing there.  Send a little storm.  What a little message, like that's trivializing the power.  If you believe in God, that's trivializing his power.  Nigga, he can take, he can fart and destroy the world.  How about that?  He can just stop gravity.  All right.  You know what?  Gravity doesn't exist.  Boop.  We all float off.  Then we'll stop gravity back up.  Just like a guy. 
[02:51:00]  That would solve a lot of problems.  Just over America.  No, you know what you do?  Let's see.  We'll stop gravity for 60 seconds.  Yeah, let everybody go up.  And then we fall back down.  The ones that were smart enough to be in a house, they live.  All right.  Let's go to Robert in New Orleans.  He's saying the mayor is out of his mind.  Robert?  Yeah, what's up, man?  Hey.  Hey, it's Nutbag here.  He was fine for the storm, but God damn, after the storm, he's lost his fucking mind. 
[02:51:30]  Yeah, he's a crazy person.  I agree.  Yeah, he's sitting here blaming God and everything.  He's the one that let over 200 school buses and all the regional transit buses go underwater  instead of using them to get out the city.  Let's blame him.  Blame himself.  Well, there perhaps is a little guilt in there, and that's why he's blaming God.  Let's not go that far.  He's black.  Don't blame him.  He might feel it.  No, I can't blame him.  You can't fully blame black people.  All right.  Mike, I'm going out.  50% blame.  Mike, I'm going to blame discount.  You guys got to talk about the bottled miracle spring water they sell on Sunday mornings on 
[02:52:00]  like FX or one of them channels like that.  They sell bottled miracle water.  Yeah, I've seen that.  Can we get some of that audio for the show?  Write that down in your own.  That is the worst freaking stuff.  I can't believe that these people are on YouTube.  You guys got to tape some Sunday morning shit.  All right, yeah, tape the stuff with the...  Not just the rambling droning guys, the real flamboyant over-the-top selling shit guys.  Remember that other guy, the make a pledge for Jesus?  He tried to get you to put your hand on the screen.  Make a pledge.  Yeah, yeah, yeah. 
[02:52:30]  Watching it for like a fucking hour, trying to figure out what it is, and you basically  send him money, and then he'll...  With a prayer, and then he tells Jesus what you want.  Yeah.  He's got the direct line.  You've got to go through him.  He's got like a...  He's the operator.  We've got Token Jew.  He's very mad at us.  Token Jew, what's up?  What's happening?  All right, sir.  So, when was the last time you guys were back in Tehran?  It sounds like you're pretty knowledgeable on what's going on back there.  What, in Tehran?  Yeah, in Tehran.  They're pretty, I don't know, pretty fundamentalist over there. 
[02:53:00]  They are, but just like, you know, back there, we can't believe everything the news says.  Man, you can't believe everything here the news says about what's going on there.  I do know that the Iranian government is pretty nasty.  I know the leader that...  I don't even watch the news, and I know that motherfucker wants to have Jew sandwiches.  How's there anything wrong with that?  Come on, now.  Jew sandwiches.  Come on.  I'd like some fried Jew, please.  That motherfucker has made it clear I am going to fucking... 
[02:53:30]  I want to kill Jews.  We want it wiped off.  They've made it pretty clear that they're not exactly too, you know, too happy with us.  And they've got nukes out the ass.  You've got Pakistan and India that's got nukes out the ass, and they're both psychotic.  Yeah, but they can't reach here.  Yeah, exactly.  We never said that they weren't.  They can't reach here, yes.  They can't reach here.  Yeah, they can't reach here, yes.  But they sure should have tagged Iran, which is happening next door.  Yeah, what's wrong with Tehran?  You're going to protect themselves.  Come on, man.  Kids are shit.  Let them blow each other up. 
[02:54:00]  Here's the thing.  But that wasn't even the point we were making, were we?  Nah.  We were just saying that they pray a lot over there.  That's what I'm saying, that those countries...  That guy didn't make his point.  Yeah, those fucking nuclear weapons.  The Buddhist thing.  And then it's like, you know what?  You can't believe God.  You can't...  That's the thing.  Pakistan and India, you can't believe God wants you to fight over that goofy country,  the sweater...  Kashmir.  You can't...  You can't believe that.  You can't believe this is some holy shit that you're fighting over this goofy little country. 
[02:54:30]  The same thing with Israel and Jerusalem.  Stop!  Same thing.  Fucking stop!  God wants you to fight over this.  Are you joking me?  That could be like their Florida.  Yeah, right.  You ever see the prayers that the soldiers say when they leave?  You know, whatever gets you through the battle, but it's, you know, God, please confuse our  enemy.  Make us safe.  Make the enemy not see us.  Confuse them.  Get us through the mission. 
[02:55:00]  So we can kill them.  Yeah, like God is going, all right, I hear you.  I'll, you know, pull in some Jedi mind shit on the Iraqis.  I'm over here.  And then while our convoy goes by the Iraqis, they go, what was that?  They turn their head and look the other way.  Because God made a little sound.  And according to life, everybody's God, God does exist.  Because sometimes everybody wins.  You know, the insurgents kill one of us, we kill one of them, so it's like, thanks  my Lord, and thanks your Lord, and thanks my Lord, thanks your, good one your Lord, good 
[02:55:30]  one my Lord.  It's like, stop making this shit trivial, dude, it's bigger than, you should pray to  Satan before you go into battle.  You probably have some better plans.  Some nice, like, real evilness.  Satan, do what you do.  Satan, let our weapons pulverize these people into forms that will haunt my nightmares.  Give me some ideas.  Turn sand into ants.  I got, I got, I got one bullet left and a knife. 
[02:56:00]  Give me ideas.  This guy's got an M60, give me some ideas.  Satan, I request from you a wall of fire that will burn my enemy to rise from the desert  floor.  Satan, I could use them wings and horns right now for you to fly into someone's ass.  Satan, uh, I'm low on men.  I could really use an army of the undead to walk the earth.  Satan, please conjure up a couple of jackal-like creatures and the rock to come and a mummy. 
[02:56:30]  Can you conjure up a mummy and some jackals, please?  Devour my enemies, leaving only their genitals strewn across the desert floor.  Can you conjure up a five-headed dog and a bitch that turns you into stone and a...  Something with a snake.  Something with a snake.  Something evil with a snake.  The hounds of hell.  Two-headed serpent.  The hounds of hell.  The hounds of hell.  A five-headed...  That's the kind of shit you need.  That would scare the shit out of the enemy. 
[02:57:00]  Yeah.  All right, let's get back to this audio.  It's the mayor of New Orleans.  Let's start this over because it gets to the Chocolate City things.  All right.  That's the highlight of this play.  Crazy mayor.  As we think about rebuilding New Orleans, surely God is mad at America?  He's sending hurricane after hurricane after hurricane and is destroying and putting stress on this country?  Surely he's not approval of us being in Iraq under false pretenses? 
[02:57:30]  Go ahead.  But surely he is upset at black America also.  We're not taking care of ourselves.  Now we're not taking care of our women.  And we're not taking care of our children.  When you have a community where 70% of his children are being born to one parent, we as black people, it's time. 
[02:58:00]  It's time for us to come to jail.  That's what I've been talking about.  It's time for us to rebuild a New Orleans, the one that should be a Chocolate New Orleans.  Here it comes, the announcement.  A Chocolate New Orleans.  I missed the line, yeah.  Sorry.  I'm just getting nervous.  I'm hearing the speech that I've always run through in my head.  Black man, everyone go and get your Katrina's, wink, wink.  And do a Category 6 also crack a skull.  Wait, wait, Patrice, what was that fucking code word from Hotel Rwanda over the radio? 
[02:58:30]  Did you see Hotel Rwanda?  Oh, God damn, was that good.  But over the radio, when the Hutu and the Tutsi were fighting, I guess the Hutu had this secret code word that went over the radio that let them know,  So, all right, get your machetes and start fucking hacking.  Start hacking.  Oh, oh, you got to see it.  Don Cheel is great.  Fantastic.  He is one of the most underrated actors.  He's not underrated anymore.  I don't think he's underrated. 
[02:59:00]  I think he is.  Absolutely not.  I say he is.  He's rated exactly where he should be rated.  Really?  Yes, he's not underrated.  He's not underrated anymore.  No way.  He should be in more shit?  He is in a lot of shit.  Leading roles?  Fuck him.  Who says he's not a good actor?  He's doing the big NFL commercial right now.  Is he?  Ocean's 12, Ocean's 11.  Fuck him.  Fuck him, then.  Let him get overexposed.  All right, here we go.  Here's the line about Chocolate City.  You're really lost on that one, Anthony. 
[02:59:30]  I'm so lost.  I don't think so.  I think he's right where he should be.  That was like the fucking Rich Voss and that actress that we had on the phone saying that she was underrated,  and she turns out she was going to be in a pretty big blockbuster movie.  That's right.  Oh, God, I sounded like Voss.  Here's the Chocolate City thing.  And that should be a chocolate New Orleans.  Delicious.  And I don't care what people are saying, Hucktown, or wherever they are.  This city will be chocolate at the end of the day. 
[03:00:00]  Yeah.  Uh-oh.  P-Funk.  This city will be a majority African-American city.  Mm-hmm.  It's the way God wants it to be.  You can't have New Orleans no other way.  Fuck the crack.  It wouldn't be New Orleans.  Flashlight.  Yeah.  Holy shit, he's lost his mind.  It is time to cut down the tall trees.  It is time to cut down the tall trees. 
[03:00:30]  That was the word, man.  That was the code.  Oh, the word went out, and that was it.  La-da-da-dee-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da.  What was that thing they used to do in South Africa where they'd take the tire and put it around somebody?  They'd beat somebody fucking senseless in the street.  Have them sitting there, put a tire around their neck with gasoline in it.  Light it on fire.  And light that bitch on fire.  A flaming tire around your neck.  And there's nothing you can do with it.  And it was called something.  It was like a something neck tire.  A flaming tire. 
[03:01:00]  Some flaming tire.  A flaming tire for the bartender.  Barkeep.  A flaming tire around the neck thing.  That's my guess.  A flaming tire.  Some Zambuca.  Kalua.  A Zambuca.  Give me a flaming.  Some Zambuca.  It was called a flaming tire.  Flaming tire.  We're all out of Zambuca.  Ah, shit.  Well, and a Watusi.  Top it off in a flaming cut down the tall tree.  Put that tall tree, umbrella, whatever you need. 
[03:01:30]  Broccoli.  So, there you go.  The mayor loses his mind.  There's nothing really to say there.  Why is he losing his mind?  He's just saying he's losing his job.  Yeah.  So, now what he's trying to do is rally black people around him.  Everyone has fucked up in that situation.  And they should all just get the boot.  Mike and Clinton.  Everyone.  Mike.  Governor.  All of them.  Hi, sir.  Hey, how you doing, guys?  All right.  Mike sees it the other way here.  Happy birthday, Patrice.  Listen. 
[03:02:00]  I think, you know, America has a way.  He says that God is mad at America.  God has a way of cleaning up his own mess.  Look at the tsunami.  All the prostitutions.  The little kids over there getting raped and fucked in the ass.  He finally went over there and said, flatten them.  But he killed them, too.  Yeah.  He killed all the little innocent kids that...  Well, that's so they don't have to suffer.  Well, they would suffer if they blew away the people that were fucking him in the ass.  Then they would stop suffering. 
[03:02:30]  Well, he cleaned up the area.  He cleaned it out.  That's what I look at.  Same thing down in New Orleans.  New Orleans was a cesspool.  He cleaned it out.  Absolutely amazing people think this way.  And I'm telling you, this mayor, he should just shut his mouth.  It amazes me.  The reason he wants a black America is because that's the only way he got voted in there.  Sir.  That's what it is.  I think nature has a way of, you know, taking care of itself, but you can't start playing  You don't think it has anything to do with the fact that those cities were near the ocean?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Well, that's what he does.  He goes in and he just cleans out America. 
[03:03:00]  What about the cities that are fucked up that are landlocked?  Well, that's what Americans go in and we clean them out.  Why?  No, no.  In the United States.  Religion and militia mixes.  Yeah.  For wonderful.  What about like evilness in Montana?  I don't know.  How is that?  You know what?  He got a lot of love when he goes, I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I'm just speaking on these gooks.  Evil people always live near the beach.  God's plan. 
[03:03:30]  I don't know.  All right.  You're not ready for crossfire yet.  I don't know, Montana.  My head knows.  That is refreshing.  You don't get to hear that enough.  God bless that guy for saying that.  He refused to even think it's still there.  There's someone giving up.  All right.  You got me.  I was trying to hide it.  I don't know.  You're not ready for Sunday morning TV.  Keep practicing.  I don't know.  Fucking God.  It's God punished.  That's what he did.  I would love to hear that on TV, though, instead of this horse shit they throw at each other.  Well, that's a good point.  I don't know.  Right in the presidential debate. 
[03:04:00]  Well, how are you going to balance the budget?  I don't know.  No one else has seemed to have done it.  That's what you asked me for.  Here's my plan.  I don't know.  You know how these things work.  I'm not in control of what I'm saying up here.  I just look good in a suit.  Oh, God.  They should God punish him.  God punishes the people who pray to him.  There's temples that are 10,000 years old with grass growing on the outside of them and evil traps.  So you don't take...  There's a gold Buddha inside that no one fucking steals because they're afraid of the wrath of God. 
[03:04:30]  Right.  But God goes, you know what?  Fuck all that.  I'm going to...  First of all, I'm going to start a Category 14 earthquake.  And then I'm going to wash these motherfuckers away.  Really?  Wash the children and wash them...  Everybody.  The animals.  Come on, man.  Stop.  That's a God I don't want to pray to.  I'm going to be honest with you.  I'm going to do that shit and want to do that shit.  How do you explain a church bus driving down the highway that a boulder that was sitting there on a mountaintop that probably saw fucking dinosaurs walking by at some point in its life on that mountaintop decides that's the moment. 
[03:05:00]  It's going to roll down the mountain and hit a bus full of churchgoers.  It's called natural selection.  Is that what it is?  It's called...  Yes.  It's God says...  You know what?  I need them.  Watch this.  Boom.  I will push that rock now.  People just make up shit.  I think God probably looks down after everybody says all the shit he says. 
[03:05:30]  It's like a celebrity reading Star Magazine and going, dude, I never said that.  That's what he made.  That's not even me in the picture.  Can we sue somebody?  Call my agent.  God has sued everybody for slander.  He's going to come back.  He's going to do this show.  I'm coming in tomorrow.  Fuck that.  You know, let me explain Noah's heart.  Listen to me, man.  That shit was blown way out of the ocean.  Here's how it really went.  It was a category...  How the hell could I fit all that one boat?  Seven.  At the time, I was tired and I turned up the category meter by mistake. 
[03:06:00]  I've said this before.  I've admitted.  Right.  No wrath.  I wasn't smiting.  I just was tired.  Just was tired and I fucked up.  I was there.  I was smoking.  I fell asleep.  The cigarette dropped on Kentucky.  That's the show.  When they always say Jesus is coming back, it's like, dude, what is he waiting for?  How much more fucked up can it get?  It's supposed to get, like, real fucked up. 
[03:06:30]  Where everyone's fucked up, I guess.  Like, you enjoy your life pretty much?  You're doing all right?  Yeah.  I mean, I'm a typical miserable comedian, but I mean, yeah.  You've got to be all fucked up.  I think everybody's got to reach the point where they're like, oh, my God, I'm fucked.  And the last person goes, oh, God, I'm fucked up.  And then Jesus goes, ah, curtain time.  Finally, it's time for me to come back.  Finally.  Patrice is off the goddamn stage.  I can do what I have to do. 
[03:07:00]  Yeah.  That's what he's waiting for.  Patrice is going to fucking see that red light.  God, Patrice, that motherfucker.  I'm trying to come back and he's going over.  Patrice is actually going to save us.  He's going to just stay on stage as we get our shit together.  Stay alive, Patrice.  And what's with this God?  Hey, Mike in Jersey.  Go ahead, Mike.  Jesus, I kind of like, I see it.  Mike.  Hey, what's going on, guys?  What's up?  Hey, what kind of shit would it stir up if New York had to be evacuated and Mike Bloomberg 
[03:07:30]  was like, well, we have an excellent opportunity here.  I think New York should be vanilla.  And you know what I mean.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Well, no, no.  Could you describe it any better?  White guilt would prevent that from happening.  Yeah.  White guilt would prevent that from happening.  Yeah.  I mean, the cops would do it, but there's just so many liberals.  And let me, I'm going to tell you that infinitely in this city and in the world, like we were  talking about yesterday with the Clay Agan thing.  Yeah.  The line of hatred for white people that think they're just white, Jews, sissies, and then 
[03:08:00]  blacks.  We're third on the fucking list.  Sissies.  Black and third.  So they're not going to come after blacks.  There's just too many, they don't like Jews and don't like gays in this country, regular  white people.  And that's it.  That's it.  Joe from Brooklyn.  Joe.  Wait, wait, wait.  You can always tell by American Idol voting.  We figured that out yesterday.  No, no.  I hated it.  They'll vote a black guy.  Yeah, but when it comes down to straight up violence, like if we would like to start  clashing, it's white and black. 
[03:08:30]  Worldwide?  I wouldn't be able to speak to you.  Dude, worldwide though?  We're talking worldwide.  Oh, worldwide.  Oh, worldwide.  I thought we were talking about that.  In this country, yeah, the Jews aren't liked by the white supremacists, but the Jews don't  fight.  Gays, you're not going to get a good fight out of gays.  The blacks, you're going to fight.  When do Jews drop out of athletics?  You watch like the old classic sports.  Mark Spitz.  They're like fucking doing the butterfly. 
[03:09:00]  That guy was an athletic Jew.  Yeah, what about that?  He was the last athletic Jew.  Sandy Koufax.  Wait a minute.  During what time?  Yes.  That's right.  During the time when Jews decided to start going, kill them motherfuckers.  They stopped all sports.  Enough.  This is, fuck this shit.  Munich Olympics.  Soon as we try to wrestle, soon as we try to fucking swim, you motherfuckers try to  take advantage of us.  That's it.  We're going to stop running soon.  We're going to stop playing sports.  It's a distraction from the real-  We're going to get you.  Except for we can't blend in with nobody.  We only have to kill motherfuckers in Africa because if we go to Europe, it's like, there 
[03:09:30]  were two niggas standing outside.  Let's go to Joe in Brooklyn.  Joe.  What's up, boys?  What's up, fellas?  You know what I don't understand is that this motherfucker, you know, he's got the  audacity to talk shit now.  But when everybody's donating money, and you guys did a fucking fundraising that raised  what, 50,000 plus, and everybody else is doing fucking telethons, and all this other shit  that we, that, that, that America did to raise money.  Now he's going to go on fucking TV and talk shit and say, it's a joke with this, we don't 
[03:10:00]  need this, it's God punishing this one.  Get the fuck out of here, this motherfucker.  We can get a fuck window crack.  Who the fuck is real with this guy?  Joe from Brooklyn.  This fucking guy over fucking here takes all the fucking, fucking white guy's fucking  money, now he's going to spend it on fucking boomboxes down there in fucking New Orleans.  No, but seriously, fellas, how much money do we donate, you know, in general?  I was talking to Fat Nick the other fucking day, and this fucking guy said, he's schwarzes. 
[03:10:30]  He's, you know, he's, you know why he's mad though, and then, that, that anger is like,  he had just a glimpse of, like, liking niggas for just to see, he had some, some, some nigga  loving in him, and he just, he fell for the Katrina.  Right, right.  And then, this shit, and he's like, those fucking backstabbing niggas.  They fucking fooled me.  I like them, I like those whack motherfuckers for a minute, and look what the fuck they did.  Look what they did. 
[03:11:00]  They tricked me to motherfuckers.  I got my receipt for this fucking hurricane.  I want my donation money back.  All right, Joe.  He got his donation.  It's only 15 days old.  He wants his money back.  He's supposed to buy a new tin fucking shack, walking around with a fucking medallion right  around his fucking neck.  And now this fucking mayor wants to talk about chocolate fucking city.  Fuck him.  Fucking movies over here.  My nigga donation's broken.  I want my money back.  It doesn't fucking work. 
[03:11:30]  It doesn't fucking work.  You think he wrote that on his fucking check memo, that little line?  To the fucking niggas.  There you go.  I give.  I don't hate you this week.  Because Katrina, you know, who the fuck is Katrina?  Or his wife goes, Tommy, who's Katrina?  I don't fucking know.  I don't fucking know.  Angela, shut the fuck up.  Angie, what'd I say?  What'd I say? 
[03:12:00]  What'd I say?  Katrina.  Yeah, but what'd I say?  Katrina, parentheses, wet niggas in New Orleans.  Jesus.  Fucking guy.  All right, let's go to Rob on Long Island.  Rob.  Hey, guys.  Hey.  I don't want to be a pest, and you could probably bash me if you want.  I just, I'm the one who made the bit with my little brother reenacting the Jimmy Norton bit,  and Opie's mentioned it twice so far, and I'm like sitting here going crazy just wondering  when he's going to play it, so.  Yeah, we should do that now. 
[03:12:30]  Wow, we've been teasing this for a couple days already, and it's been on the internet  for like a month at least.  All right, yeah, we're good.  Yeah, because every day I call my brother saying, yeah, come over, you can hear yourself on the  radio, the kid's only 11, and then every day it's like, no, you can't come over today,  I'm sorry.  All right, Rob, we'll do it today.  We'll do it right now.  Thank you.  All right, so listen now or in the replay.  Yeah, why don't we change gears a little bit?  This is really good.  Norton went off on an angry caller.  Caller was complaining about our show, whatever.  And Norton, classic Norton, just went off. 
[03:13:00]  So what we should do is play the original.  Norton going off on this call.  Oh, we got this finally.  Yeah.  And then this guy got his little brother to reenact Norton's part in this call.  Kid does such a good job.  This is great.  So why don't we play the original first?  Here it is.  What I'm saying is, person who I hope dies of cancer the day before a relative gets married,  what type of a skit would you like to hear?  And you're not being specific.  You're being passive-aggressive like every other faggot from that state that you live 
[03:13:30]  in.  So will you please be specific?  Get the cock out of your mouth and talk right.  Be specific.  Get the cock out of your mouth.  Oh, he got you there.  Oh, I got a cock in my mouth.  Well, it's your father.  Since your mother won't suck it, I decided to lean over and toot on it a little bit.  What's up with the wrist, huh?  What's that?  You're in San Francisco sucking cock, you fag.  Oh, there we go.  That's the type of skit you like, isn't it?  Dirty two men talking about sucking cocks.  Now we got what you like.  Two men going back and forth. 
[03:14:00]  So tell us what you want, Kenny.  Why do we just have these truck drivers calling in, you know, which I agree, they're fine,  they're great callers, but we all ain't all for them to fail.  Oh, I know.  You want to sketch with a funny southern voice.  That's probably the type of comedy you like.  The type of thing where the funny voice is happening, or maybe the gay character comes  in, hi, boys, and you're like, ha, ha, that's good.  The guy sounds gay.  I'm having a real hard time understanding you.  No, you're not, stupid.  What's a bad speech impairment, don't you? 
[03:14:30]  Impairment?  What's an impairment, you fucking idiot?  I speak perfectly clearly, and you understand everything I'm saying.  I've asked you for a show that you listen to.  Let me finish, fucker.  I've asked you for something that you like, and you haven't been able to provide it.  Name me one show you listen to.  Name me one show.  That's what I'm listening to.  I've been an XM subscriber for over a year.  I don't give a shit.  Cancel the service, faggot.  Tell me something you listen to.  Don't, you're not going to blackmail me.  I'm an XM subscriber.  I don't get a piece of the action, motherfucker. 
[03:15:00]  What do I care?  Oh, shit.  Don't lose a customer.  I don't care if you throw your XM down the toilet, buy a serious, and then fuck your mother.  Tell me what you want to hear.  Tell me what you want to hear.  You're not answering the question.  How about something funny?  What show do you think is funny?  You got something funny.  What show?  Wait a minute, wait a minute.  No, I'm not going to wait a minute, you cop sucker.  What's to tell me to wait a minute, you saggity West Coast caller?  You know what you fucking get paid to do?  Yes, I get paid a lot to do this. 
[03:15:30]  That's the beauty of it.  I don't know, and you're fucking ripping them off all the way to the bank.  Oh, I'm laughing all the way to the bank, am I, you cliche-slinging bucket of jism.  I hope you're on the radio.  I hope you're killed the drunk driving accident on New Year's Eve.  You're fucking on the radio.  We want to hear some sketches with southern voices.  Get behind the wheel after drinking a few and plow into a pregnant lady.  How's that for a sketch?  West Coast jerk-off.  What, what, what, what, what, what?  So there you are, that's the original. 
[03:16:00]  Damn, Norty.  That is the original.  That is the classic James Norton right there.  Yep.  And then...  Angry Jimmy.  Rob on Long Island got his 11-year-old brother to redo that whole thing with his brother doing  Norton's part.  Yeah.  Listen to that same bit.  What I'm saying is, person who I hope dies of cancer the day before a relative gets married,  what type of a sketch would you like to hear?  And you're not being specific.  You're being passive-aggressive like every other faggot from that state you live in.  So will you please be specific?  Put your mouth and talk right. 
[03:16:30]  Be specific.  Get out of your mouth.  Oh, he got you there.  Oh, I got a cock in my mouth.  Well, it's your father since your mother won't suck it.  I decided to lean over and toot on it a little bit.  What's that?  San Francisco sucking cock, you fad.  Oh, there we go.  That's the type of skit you like, isn't it?  Dirty two men talking about sucking cock.  Now we got what you like.  Two men going back and forth.  So tell us what you want, Kenny.  Why do we just have these truck drivers calling in?  You know, which I agree, they're fine, they're great callers, but we all ain't offering a fail. 
[03:17:00]  Oh, I know you.  You want a sketch with a funny southern voice.  That's probably the type of comedy you like.  The type of thing where the funny voice is happening, or maybe the gay character comes in.  Hi, boys.  And you're like, oh, the guy sounds gay.  I'm having a real hard time understanding you.  No, you're not, stupid.  Bad speech impairment, don't you?  What's an impairment, you fucking idiot?  I speak perfectly clearly, and you understand everything I'm saying.  Let me finish, fucker.  I thank you for something that you like, and you haven't been able to provide it. 
[03:17:30]  Name me one show you listen to.  Name me one show.  What I'm listening to, I've been an XM subscriber for over a year.  I don't give a shit.  Cancel the service, faggot.  Tell me something you listen to.  You're not going to blackmail me.  I'm an XM subscriber.  I don't get a piece of the action, motherfucker.  What do I care?  Oh, shit.  Don't lose a customer.  I don't care if you throw your XM down the toilet, buy a Sirius, and then fuck your mother. 
[03:18:00]  Tell me what you want to hear.  Tell me what you want to hear.  You're not answering the question.  I want something funny.  What show do you think is funny?  I want something funny.  What show?  Wait a minute.  No, I'm not going to wait a minute, you cocksucker.  Don't tell me to wait a minute.  You're an idiot.  Faggoty West Coast caller.  Is that what you fucking get paid to do?  Yes.  I get paid a lot to do this.  That's the beauty of it.  I don't know.  And you're fucking ripping them off all the way to the street?  Oh, I'm laughing all the way to the bank, am I?  You cliche slinging bucket of jism.  I hope you're killed in a drunk driving accident on New Year's Eve. 
[03:18:30]  Come on, fuck.  We want to hear some sketches with southern voices.  Get behind the wheel after drinking a few and plow into a pregnant lady.  How's that for a sketch, West Coast jerk-off?  Wah-wah-wah-wah-wah-wah-wah.  Hey, there you go.  Fucking genius, dude.  That's great, Rob.  Oh, my God.  Rob and your brother, whoever his name is.  Very good job.  There's something when kids curse, it's that much funnier.  Absolutely.  Cursing little children.  We encourage people to send in their kids cursing.  I don't know what happened with that bit. 
[03:19:00]  Yeah, what did happen?  Maybe we can start here, right?  Start that again and start collecting them.  That did a good Jimmy Norton impression.  We'll take a little break.  Aight.  And we'll finish the O.P. and Anthony show in just a bit.  All right, we have Patrice O'Neill and Bill Burr in studio today helping us out. 
[03:19:30]  It's been a fun show so far.  Yeah.  Only a few minutes left.  We do have some clips from Flavor of Love.  We were talking about that yesterday.  Could do that.  Trying to think what else is going on in the news.  We've pretty much covered it all.  Anything off the top of your head?  We never got into the Pharrell controversy.  That's your job.  You are the top of the head, motherfucker. 
[03:20:00]  I'm trying to think where to go, that's all.  We had our controversy, our DJ controversy for the day, but people are always asking me  every day about the Pharrell situation.  Fuck Pharrell.  I can't believe that guy.  That whole thing.  You talk about burning bridges, man.  This guy wants to just burn every single bridge possible.  That's his goal.  That's his goal.  He's doing a good job of it.  What happened?  I guess while I was sick, something popped up on his website.  Yeah, he's got a website and usually runs down sports picks and scores and stuff on his 
[03:20:30]  front page.  And then one day, of course, our pests were constantly vigilant looking for people who  are enemies of this program.  Found the link to the site and gave it to us.  And his front page said the daily skinny sports scores, picks below, and news.  Just check the Pharrell front page below on Fox Sports Radio, blah, blah, blah.  And then he writes, Stern's debut was huge on Sirius Talk about a machine. 
[03:21:00]  They're going to crush people.  He'll blow away XM and O&A easily.  Oh!  That's like...  What is he doing?  Oh!  Oh!  Does he need a job that bad?  Why you...  I'm sick of these guys on regular radio, you know, kissing Howard's ass, thinking Howard's  going to give him a job.  Pharrell...  Not Pharrell the rapper.  No, Scott.  Who is this guy?  Oh.  I thought you meant...  It's not as exciting.  I thought you meant...  No, no.  That could have been some gunfire. 
[03:21:30]  Pharrell the...  The nerd?  The mixed genius there.  I mean, Pharrell the sports...  He didn't do that whistling song, though, did he?  He's retracting his statement now or something?  I don't know.  There was somebody on a message board that was speaking for him, saying he was close friends  with Pharrell, and he was trying to say what Pharrell meant by it, but I posted on the message  board, and I said, if Pharrell wants to come on the show and explain his side of it, I'm  fine with that, but until then, fuck him. 
[03:22:00]  Was that little picture of you with your M16 in the corner?  No, that's the MySpace picture.  Oh, okay.  No, the whack bag picture is...  We'll see what this is about.  Maybe we'll get him on the show tomorrow or something.  I have a sig pic of Hitler doing his little dance up at the Wolf's Lair.  And it says, dance in Hitler, you know, without the G, because it's funny that way.  Dance in.  Hysterical.  It's fucking Hitler dancing.  Yes, it is.  So we'll, I don't know, we'll try to get Pharrell on the show. 
[03:22:30]  Yeah.  Yeah, yeah, until he gets, you know...  But, you know, why would you write that?  He's supposedly a friend of the show.  I don't know.  Crushed...  Oh, see, he's not that guy I argued with that one day, is he?  Yes.  Oh, that guy.  So I think you fucked up our relationship.  And we've been trying to figure out how to get him...  And that was all the...  All the message was speculation was all, you know, I think it's because fucking Bill gave  him some shit that day, and now he's fucking not friends with O&A anymore.  Ooh.  Shut up. 
[03:23:00]  Ooh.  Billy.  More controversy with the jocks.  Fucking shit up.  We'll see.  No, mind you, I just destroyed bits.  Oh.  Yeah.  What do you mean?  Just out of pure ignorance.  I go, you know what I notice every time you do this?  It seems like that.  And, like, totally expose a bit.  Yeah.  Because I'm so dumb, I don't even understand.  We had a running gag that I would read an instant feedback and be angry with the person,  very angry with them, and say, you know something?  I'm banning them.  And I would go to, like, click on the ban thing, and Opie would go, you know what? 
[03:23:30]  Why don't you give him another chance?  You know, the guy maybe didn't know, and I would consider it and then go, okay, but just  this one time.  And it was the recurring bit.  And people, I guess, at home would realize, well, you know, he never really seems to ban  anybody.  And I never banned people.  That was the joke.  People exposed good cop, bad cop.  Yeah.  It's like, can you not expose?  Yeah, that's a fucking tango and cash.  And one day, that's what he did.  I never exposed that.  I did the bit. 
[03:24:00]  Opie said, no.  I said, all right, I won't ban him.  And then Bill goes, hey, you know, you never really seem to ban anybody.  That's Bill.  Thanks, Bill.  Captain in the CSI of jokes.  Dude, dude, I see at .8 seconds, you laugh at your own joke.  Got you.  Got you.  CSI.  Got a pair of tweezers and a hair.  Fucking joke crime.  It's a hair.  You would have banned that.  The whole room looked at Bill that day. 
[03:24:30]  I'm like, oh, you must have felt this big.  Nah, I didn't give a shit.  That's not the fingerprints we found on the ban button.  It was the lack thereof of any fingerprints on the ban button, proving it has never been  touched by Anthony's hand.  I rest my case.  Oh, I got crashed that day on my stage.  Nice going, fucko.  Oh, you just made the fuckhole list.  Bit ruiner.  Yeah.  All right.  Speaking of other jocks, FMQB, it's one of these trade magazines. 
[03:25:00]  It's online, too, FMQB.com.  You know, there's a lot of talk about commercial radio versus satellite radio lately.  We go down this path every once in a while.  Regular radio is now running spots against satellite radio, even though in the beginning  they were taking commercials for satellite radio.  Yeah.  I don't know what they're doing.  They're obviously getting very nervous over there in the commercial radio world.  So FMQB had a question.  They do a question of the week with jocks from all over America.  Right. 
[03:25:30]  All over America, in some fine towns like, ugh, like, ugh, USA.  And the question of the week was, you're the head of imaging for terrestrial radio.  What's its new campaign slogan?  All right.  So a slogan for commercial radio, basically, regular radio, what have you.  And now you have to come up with a new slogan to get people to listen to commercial radio  over satellite radio.  And these dopey people in radio actually responded to this question. 
[03:26:00]  And then FMQB actually...  Stopey?  They actually posted the more creative ones, I guess.  So here are some of them.  The first one's from Chase Murphy from WFBC.  My name is Chase Murphy.  I'm Chase Murphy.  What, Arnold Chase?  That's the Arnold name.  Collateral damage, too.  Chase Murphy.  My name is Chase Murphy. 
[03:26:30]  I'm here to save you.  And the question comes up from time to time why I and I don't do these radio junkets  and why we don't have a lot of friends in radio.  It's examples like this that just makes it very obvious for everybody.  We don't want to be associated with this crap.  So the question is, you know, what would be your new slogan for commercial radio?  Chase Murphy.  WFBC.  His slogan is radio.  It's free and it's not as bad as it seems. 
[03:27:00]  And they printed this shit.  Is that supposed to be, like, funny or...  Mom, please stop calling me.  Mom!  I'm not going.  I have to do this now.  I don't know if it's funny.  I have no idea.  I guess they're trying to go for some humor.  Everywhere I go, they now have that shit.  When I was in San Francisco, hyping my shows, I was on something, something, free FM. 
[03:27:30]  Oh, it's free FM all over.  And now all of a sudden, they all of a sudden fucking realize, like, hey, wait a minute,  guys.  I think there's going to be a problem.  They're so stupid to say free FM, even, because now you're drawing attention to yourself.  Like, we're free FM.  So, wait, what does that mean?  What is paid?  And then someone will explain.  What's the option?  Well, the option is you've got to pay for radio, and it gives you, and they...  What does that give me?  And then, you know, commercials, and 200 channels, and music, and...  Blah, blah, blah.  Oh, really?  Right.  They're so stupid.  If they really want to compete, they should just try to ignore and do what they do. 
[03:28:00]  They did try that.  Learn nothing from television.  Jagger from WKCI.  His slogan for commercial radio.  FM radio.  Always been free.  Always will.  Oh, dear Lord.  Yeah, oh, dear Lord.  Wait, wait.  That's a rip-off of another slogan, like, from a real product.  Another awful... 
[03:28:30]  Always had it.  Always will.  Well, never had it.  Never had it.  Never will.  Seven up.  And here's the problem, Ovi, though.  Yeah.  I was running through this thing.  Yeah.  Here's...  Instead of reading them all...  Stink.  Seven up games.  I think when they ask that question, this is the thing we're talking about being edgy.  Just try to find the ones that are sarcastic.  Right.  Like, there are none that are even, like, cynical, like, fucking...  Oh, no.  No, they're trying...  Blow me for asking me that shit.  Right.  It's only maybe one or two.  The rest are, like, radio.  Play. 
[03:29:00]  I'm gonna figure it out, you know.  Yeah.  Hey, it's free.  Tim Moore says it all from WJBQ.  His slogan?  It's free.  Yeah.  Stan Priest doesn't, uh, do much better from WSTO.  We're still free and we kick ass.  Well, actually, we kick...  By the way, you know, when you're telling these little stories, here's a good idea. 
[03:29:30]  Have a point.  It makes it so much more interesting for the listener.  It's free...  See, now, Brody from WDCG, I think he's trying to be sarcastic and have fun with this.  One of the only ones.  He says, uh, his slogan would be, maybe we're going out on a limb here, but how about...  And here's the slogan.  Free hit music or music for poor people.  All right.  That's funny.  That's funny.  They gotta give him props.  All these other douches, forget about it. 
[03:30:00]  Carl Kraft from WRAT.  What's that, the rat in Jersey, I think?  Uh, the message would certainly have to encompass the myriad of formats.  How about America's home for the marketplace of ideas?  America's home for the marketplace of ideas.  Textiles for the future. 
[03:30:30]  What the fuck kind of old slogan shit?  I think that was the first slogan for the original Quaker Oats.  The Texaco hour of comedy.  When commercials were done by the TV show live.  Oh, yeah.  I gotta tell you.  You finish your bit, but wait a minute, and you pick up like a little can of oil.  Yeah.  Fifteen guys would attack your car with your face.  Come here, Fido.  Come here.  Hey, this is Milton.  I love this old dog.  And he loves kennel ration. 
[03:31:00]  This is Milton Berland.  Let me take this wig off for a minute to be serious with you.  Right, exactly.  Talk about Geritol.  All right, the next one.  Hey, Bob Hofer, Texaco star.  Let me tell you.  They'll pump your gas in a clean your windshield.  Back to the comedy.  Isn't that something?  Well, Michael Cross from KFMW, his slogan for commercial radio, he just kind of talks about it.  He says, I agree with CBS Radio about using free in a campaign.  I'm always pushing local, so that should be a part of it, too. 
[03:31:30]  Okay.  That's the other thing that regular radio, commercial radio is trying to do is focus on the more local stuff.  Because satellite can't do that.  Because satellite can't do that.  You know what?  I've been listening to radio since I was four fucking years.  I could give a shit about local content.  Who cares where they're talking about.  You're going to give me the local news?  As long as it's interesting.  I could get the local news myself.  Yeah.  I could get that by reading a paper or turning on the stupid news station.  They want to hear about, they want to know that if there's a snowstorm, they can come  to this station and hear school closings. 
[03:32:00]  No shit, people.  This is the type of stuff program directors will tell you.  Oh, yeah.  Windbag from Atlanta.  Go ahead.  What's up, guys?  I got the best one here for free FM.  Yeah, right?  Free FM, radio for shwuggies and Mexicans.  Wait a minute.  Here's the thing, too, Opie.  If you ask any geniuses on satellite to come up with the satellite shit, there's no more  clever motherfuckers. 
[03:32:30]  The only thing satellite has is you get the same motherfucker, but it's like, give me one  for satellite.  Watch out.  Out of space.  We're in your pocket.  It's in your pocket.  It's in your pocket.  Love it.  No, no, but they throw curses in there.  Oh, fucking watch out.  It's not fucking free.  Yeah, it's delivered to you at the speed of light, dickface.  Why am I a dickface?  I like satellite. 
[03:33:00]  I don't need to be a dickface.  I just want to listen to my Zeppelin without 20-minute commercial breaks.  Why is the job cursing at me all the time?  Are you attacking me?  Because I can, flugger.  We attack you verbally.  Dickface.  You had to swear.  For $12.99 a month, we'll tell your mother she's a fucking whore.  Nobody's clever anymore.  Boy, Sirius and XM got fucking genius.  No, motherfucker.  Yeah, when you ask questions like this.  HBO, it's not just a... 
[03:33:30]  It's a hit slogan because it's a hit channel.  It's like we're not just telling you, whoa.  Doesn't matter what it's called.  If you read that on a paper, you go, who's the cocksucker who said this dumb shit?  This stinks.  This sucks.  Yeah, it's kind of arrogant.  Well, Matt...  It's not TV.  It's HBO.  Matt Murray from WDHA, his slogan for commercial radio.  We've been doing it longer than Hugh Hefner.  Watch out.  Of doing it and...  Jackson from WKQX. 
[03:34:00]  For the price of a cup of coffee a day, you could have a cup of coffee and listen to the radio.  Radio?  Oh, I get it.  Because I guess satellite radio, if you figure it out, if you, like, skip one cup of coffee a day, you could pay for this shit.  Right?  Is that it?  I think we used that in a spot once.  And you'd be healthier?  Yeah, that kind of helps us out.  Thank you. 
[03:34:30]  Dave Lombardi.  Not just free, but here.  Dave Lombardi.  Kenny Allen from KMBY.  Hello, I'm Dave Lombardi.  No, you're not.  Stupid.  Get down.  Get down.  It's Dave Lombardi.  Who are you?  I'm Dave Lombardi.  Stop it.  Looking for my daughter.  Well, we'll continue this tomorrow. 
[03:35:00]  Dave Lombardi.  There's one, or...  I guess there's one that makes fun of us, by the way.  Oh.  Nice.  We'll tease that for tomorrow.  Good radio tease.  Oh, we're teasing things.  You know what I noticed?  Oh, shit.  What?  You guys always seem to leave, like, a...  A little cliffhanger?  Oh.  I see.  I'm going out.  Is it Dave?  I am Bill Burr.  I'm the Bit Destroyer.  Get down.  I am Bill Burr.

We got some what did you learn on the O.P. Anthony show today.  Pat, actually, Pete from Connecticut.  What I learned today, India and Pakistan are fighting over a sweater.  Dippled balls from Pal Talk.  He learned if...  Sorry.  Wow.  I learned that it's not God's fault if you get a three-week warning.  Brilliant. 
[03:36:00]  Yes.  We'll go to Pager in New York, or actually New Jersey on the phone.  Pager, what's up?  Hey, how you doing, guys?  Hey.  I want to play what you learned today on ONA.  All right.  I learned that shwuggies play chess.  Great educational programming we have here today.  You need to stop.  That's it.  That's the last one.  Shwuggies play chess.  All I need.  Andy Howard from Seattle.  FM, it's free, just like cancer.  Thank you, Andy Howard from Seattle.
