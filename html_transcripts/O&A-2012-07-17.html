<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opened with a discussion about Glenn Beck using a clip from their show featuring a disagreement with a guest, "Boss," regarding Obamacare.  Listeners reported Beck calling "Boss" an "idiot" and a "moron." The clip's origin was mysteriously attributed to Beck's producer, "Stunt Brain."  This transitioned into a conversation about the word "engaged," its different meanings, and a tangent about the British Open.

The main focus shifted to Anthony's Twitter engagement with emerging information about George Zimmerman and the Trayvon Martin case, specifically a cousin's allegation of years of molestation.  Anthony criticized the media for omitting Zimmerman's age at the time of the alleged incidents, arguing it significantly altered the narrative.  The hosts dissected the media's handling of the accusations, citing the Boston Herald's edited version of a Miami Herald story as an example of biased reporting.  They also briefly discussed the Trayvon Martin case itself, touching upon the "Stand Your Ground" law and differing interpretations of the events.  The segment concluded with a discussion about Jonah Falcon's airport security experience due to his exceptionally large penis, reminiscing about a similarly endowed past guest on *WNEW*, an announcement for a fund for Steve Carlisi's family, and promotion of upcoming segments, including a *Dark Knight Rises* viewing.

The next segment started with a humorous rant about healthcare hypocrisy, followed by a discussion of their upcoming Chicago live broadcast at 115 Bourbon Street, including potential scheduling conflicts with a possible first pitch for Opie at a Cubs or White Sox game, and a listener contest for a trip to the show.  Opie and Anthony then contrasted their approaches to relaxation: Anthony's adrenaline-fueled lifestyle versus Opie's new meditation practice, which he described humorously.  They discussed the overuse of phones and social media, considering a digital detox.  The segment ended with a tribute to Jon Lord of Deep Purple, playing music and discussing the band, along with Chip's Comic-Con interview audio and a mention of Sam Roberts as a pre-show guest.

A lengthy discussion about Comic-Con followed, based on audio clips of interviews conducted by "Chip," a bumblebee cosplayer. Chip's bizarre and often inappropriate comments, including a disturbing remark about potentially tipping over a wheelchair user, were highlighted, with the hosts referring to many cosplayers as "idiots."  The hosts spent time discussing the meaning of "cosplay" and mocking Chip's interactions.  This led to a discussion about 80s music and driving, followed by more audio clips of Chip's interactions with other cosplayers, including a woman dressed as the Abominable Snowman's daughter.  A significant portion involved identifying a musical riff, leading to chaotic phone calls and incorrect guesses, ultimately identified as Black Sabbath's "Iron Man."  The segment concluded with a discussion of Louis C.K.'s defense of Daniel Tosh on The Daily Show, touching on the differing perspectives of comedians and bloggers/feminists regarding Tosh's jokes, and a broader discussion on comedy and criticism.  A tribute to Steve C. and fundraising announcement, along with the Chicago live show promotion, were also included.


The final segment began with a critique of various sports, including weightlifting, wrestling, and several Summer Olympic events, expressing disdain for their perceived absurdity.  A discussion of a kiss cam incident at a sporting event followed, with crude humor about the couple's initial refusal and subsequent kiss.  The bulk of this segment focused on reviewing more Comic-Con audio clips from "Chip," highlighting his inappropriate comments (including repeated references to "tugging his pud") and bizarre interactions with cosplayers dressed as Toad, a Nightmare Before Christmas character, an R2-D2/Hello Kitty hybrid, Spongebob, and the Ninja Turtles.  The segment concluded with promotion of a future show featuring Gary Oldman and other guests, a plug for the Chicago live show, fundraising for the Steve C. Fund, and a discussion on perceived media bias in the George Zimmerman case reporting.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  Good morning. Welcome aboard.  Put enough of this palaver. Let's get the show on the road.  Let's do it.  Yeah, it wasn't good.  It wasn't good.  Yeah, I gotta hear it.  I like bringing to the air what we were just talking about.  Yeah.  We were just laughing at boss's expense.  I guess Glenn Beck played a clip from our radio show yesterday.  Yeah, yeah.  You gotta be a subscriber. 
[00:00:30]  It's hard to get clips from the Glenn Beck radio show.  Yeah, he's all internet now, right?  It's all internet and you gotta pay for that shit, man.  Pay me. Pay me. Pay me.  But I guess he played a clip of boss discussing Obamacare on our show.  Yeah.  I remember we were both in complete disagreement with boss on this one.  It was pretty hilarious.  And I haven't heard the clip.  You were telling me that Glenn Beck was calling boss a moron? 
[00:01:00]  A moron and an idiot.  This is just from people that I read.  There were a fuckload of tweets yesterday about it.  And people were kind of quoting what Beck was saying.  That makes me very happy.  Hilarious.  Calling boss a dope and idiot.  I guess Stunt Brain is sleeping in because he works for that Glenn Beck thing.  Yeah.  And he was the one that brought it to my attention yesterday afternoon.  Stunty.  And I want to play the clip.  Oh, we'll have it later.  Stunt Brain is doing something. 
[00:01:30]  Oh, he didn't get a hold of you.  He did get a hold of you, but we're not allowed to tell the people he got a hold of you.  I got it.  All right.  We'll have it in a little bit.  That's great.  Thank you, Stunt Brain.  Thank you.  Huh?  Or not.  Or no.  Or not.  We're going to try to get in touch with people.  You've got to make believe Stunt Brain is not sending us to us, I guess.  I guess that's a no-no in the organization over there.  So we don't know how we're getting the clip.  We have no idea.  But we're going to have it.  Thank you, Stunt Brain. 
[00:02:00]  Well, wouldn't it be good for Glenn Beck if we play a clip over here?  I would think it would be.  And then they go over there and then they subscribe and listen to a little more of Glenn Beck?  Yeah.  I think we make him money today.  What the fuck?  Where's our cut?  Correctamundo.  Oh, man.  I tell you.  I was engaged in another Twitter.  You got engaged.  Congratulations.  No, no.  Thank Jesus Christ.  Oh, it scared me.  I thought I did and I didn't know.  I've never heard the word engaged before.  I was engaged in a.  Unless it's, you know, you're on a knee and shit. 
[00:02:30]  Engaged.  On a beach or at a restaurant or at a sporting event.  I didn't know in England until I saw Shaun of the Dead that engaged also means  the line's busy on the phone.  Really?  Oh, it's engaged.  That's just stupid.  It's engaged.  Yeah, he gets all mad because the phone's busy and he goes, it's engaged.  They almost talk like us.  It's fucking weird.  They almost talk like us and then they have dumb things.  It's like, speak English over there, you fucks.  Why would you say engaged?  That's too.  Well, they're all about being proper.  Yes.  That proper shit is horrible. 
[00:03:00]  It's engaged.  British Open, though.  Oh, yeah.  You're going to watch the British Open?  No.  They're talking about the grass over there, man.  They love their grass.  It's all about the grass and the rough.  Ah, the peat.  The peat.  They said they're going to be talking about the British Open rough ad nauseum.  There it is again.  Yes, I got it in already.  Yes.  Although I don't think I said ad nauseum yesterday, which broke my streak and I'm really bummed  off that.  But they're saying you're going to hear the word juicy a lot. 
[00:03:30]  Bye.  People are having a problem with the rough and the grass at the British Open.  Why juicy?  It starts Thursday.  Oh, because is the rough juicy?  I guess they had an early spring or something, so there's like six inches of other newer grass  underneath the tough rough, and so it's spongy, and it's supposedly going to be a nightmare.  It's a whole alien world over there.  It really is.  It's so strange.  And I didn't forget.  This is just a tangent. 
[00:04:00]  We're going to jump back on the road in a second.  And then they're playing this.  It's a major.  Golf only has four majors a year, and one's the British Open.  They're playing it in just shitty weather, because it's just shitty over there.  I don't know how they do that.  When you see them playing in high winds and fucking rain and shit, how are they doing  this?  It's going to be 90-something today, right?  Optimum conditions.  I'm fucking shanking it.  Right.  Yeah.  Well, it's going to be terrible.  I think it's going to be around 90 in New York today. 
[00:04:30]  They're talking mid-50s, that misty, horrible rain that fucking makes you want to kill  somebody.  Because we golf for fun.  Like when people like normal people just go golfing, it's for fun.  So you don't want to do it in weather that sucks.  If it's your job, you've got to go out there and do it.  But like, oh, I want to have some fun and go golfing.  The weather stinks.  It's cold.  It's fucking...  Basically what you're saying, if we see any rain in the forecast, like, ah, we'll go  do something else.  Fuck it.  But these idiots over there, we're not just talking about the British Open. 
[00:05:00]  I get where you're going.  Yeah.  Regular golfers over there, they just play in the rain.  They have to.  Because that's all they have over there is shitty weather.  Terrible.  Hi to the fans over there, by the way.  We have quite the audience on it.  Across the pond.  Anyway, you were saying, I'm sorry, Ant.  Oh, I forgot.  No.  I was...  Engaged.  Yes.  Twitter.  I had engaged in a little battle online, which usually happens, over this new information  about George Zimmerman, in the Trayvon Martin case. 
[00:05:30]  It seems, if you read the papers, or any of these online things, you would think, George  Zimmerman has raped a six-year-old girl.  That's pretty much what I got from it, because, as I read, they really didn't have his age when  this happened.  So they're talking about something that happened to a six-year-old.  His cousin.  Yes.  Right.  His six-year-old cousin.  Right.  So...  But how they report it...  Right. 
[00:06:00]  They don't tell you that he might have been young at the time as well.  Well, here's how they report it.  They say she was six at the time.  Yeah.  And then later on in the story, they say what her age now might be.  Wow.  And then, I guess you're supposed to do the math and figure out how old Zimmerman is, which  they never said in the article, and then subtract that.  Like, they didn't say, she was six, he was eight at the time, when it started.  Now...  They're so hateable.  Regardless.  They're so hateable, what they do. 
[00:06:30]  I don't know what happened.  She's claiming that for ten years, from the time she was six to sixteen, George Zimmerman  would fondle her and things under the covers in bed and touch her and things like that.  And it continued for ten years, and she says now, she's coming out of the woodwork now,  to say it was some type of molestation.  I don't know.  I don't know what her agenda is.  I don't know.  I'm not saying she's wrong.  I'm not saying she's right.  It could just be goofy kids touching each other. 
[00:07:00]  Hey, we all told stories about when we were kids.  I remember being in kindergarten and showing a girl with my hiney, and I saw her hiney  in the shed, in the backyard shed.  It's called just checking out shit.  Yeah.  When you're really young, you don't even know what molestation is yet.  Now, if it continues for ten years, now you're talking, you know, she's fifteen, he's seventeen.  There's no problem with that.  Eighteen, sixteen, still.  There's no fucking problem with that.  Um, and then it just stopped, I guess. 
[00:07:30]  Why did she come out with this?  Uh, I don't know.  She decided it hurt her?  She's witness number nine.  Because, uh, she said that this was the first time she's not been afraid of him.  Not been afraid of him.  Like, because now he's in jail.  Well, yeah, well, he's out on bail.  Well, you know, same.  Um, I don't know.  It does seem like the timing is very convenient.  And this, again, has nothing to do with the actual case.  It's more of this shit that we do these days, like you're seeing in the election and everything  else, where other shit is there to just totally fuck up what is actually supposed to be dealt 
[00:08:00]  with.  Right.  And what really matters.  And what matters.  Do we have a clip of the media just, uh, reporting this story and not giving his age at the  time?  I would love to hear one of those.  I didn't hear any broadcast reports on it.  I did read a lot of, uh, uh, print shit.  And even in the print, they're not really saying his age?  Even in the print.  That's crazy.  It was a whole thing of how you had to add and subtract stuff to figure out how old  he was at the time.  Wow.  She also said that he said stuff about black people that wasn't nice. 
[00:08:30]  It's amazing how they're printing that nonsense.  That, which may be true, but I don't know about it or not.  I was like, Hey, so on Twitter last night, of course, I just get fucking bombarded with  people, uh, that obviously so many people don't even know anything about the law, which  is fine, but don't start it though.  No.  You just reported the Zimmerman thing?  I just reported it.  And then they came after you?  And they came after me.  They always do.  Those motherfuckers.  Motherfucker.  Motherfucker.  Motherfucker.  Let me say, let's read Ant's tweet that started the whole thing. 
[00:09:00]  Then they, uh.  And why are you shaking your head?  Well, I'm just, I'm just reading the, the first article that, the, that pops up when  you type in George Zimmerman into Google from the Boston Herald.  And just like Anthony says, uh, Zimmerman's cousin who said Zimmerman molested her for  10 years beginning when she was six years old, period, period.  The entire first page of this article doesn't mention how old he was.  And no one's going to keep reading what you, you don't read something in the first paragraph.  That's what everyone's going to say.  He's a child molester.  Did you see?  That's horrible. 
[00:09:30]  They're pigs.  Cause they are pigs.  Age absolutely matters in this case.  Totally matters.  Jesus Christ.  It absolutely matters.  Like I said, if you read it the way it is in the press, you would think last week he  fucked a six-year-old.  Wow.  Oh, Uncle George.  An eight-year-old and a six-year-old.  That's, that's, that's fucking around.  It's, you know, you could.  Here it is, finally.  This, halfway down the second page.  Experts said children who act out sexually with other kids have been exposed to domestic  violence and pornography.  Children as young as eight, the age the witness said Zimmerman was when he first touched her 
[00:10:00]  inappropriately.  It's, it, it's an afterthought.  Yeah.  Right, right.  It's just something else that they're talking about.  It's not even the facts of the story.  It's there as a fucking aside.  And they did research.  What did, what did Ron Valeri tell us at the time?  This goes way back and I never, I never forgot it, but he said basically people only read  the first, maybe, uh, the first two paragraphs of every story.  I forgot exactly what he said, but it was either the first paragraph or the first two.  Yeah.  And studies show after that, you pretty much, uh, know everything you need to know and you 
[00:10:30]  never read further in general, in general.  The first thing I learned in, in journalism class was who, what, when, where, why in the  first two paragraphs.  There you go.  So it might be the first two paragraphs.  So yeah, research has, has shown that people never go past that.  So if you want to, if you want to kind of skew the facts a little bit, you leave the age  out of the first two paragraphs and you're almost guaranteed that most people will never  read far enough to see how old he actually was.  Who's the reporter?  It's a bunch of them. 
[00:11:00]  It's every, I read the Reuters story was the same thing.  It's just, they're, they're terrible.  We should ask, I would love to ask a reporter on the, why wouldn't you put that in?  Hey, we want to talk to you about the George Zimmerman story.  They'll get on the phone to talk about it.  Even look at the headline.  Witness accuses George Zimmerman of sexually molesting her.  Now that, and then they got a picture of George Zimmerman now instead of a little kid  picture of him.  I mean, it just, it reeks of, of trying to put something across.  And it's the Boston Herald.  That's a big paper.  It's not some like shitty blog or something. 
[00:11:30]  Yeah.  The author of this story is Francis Robles.  Oh, right.  From Francis.  McClatchy newspapers.  So how about we get him on the phone?  Let's get him on the phone and ask him why he didn't.  I'll send a link to, uh, to the sex man.  Yeah.  Let's try to get him on the phone.  Uh, what, what's going on now?  Yes.  I'm trying to, I'm trying to educate people because people are very stupid.  I don't, I don't expect people to be lawyers or savvy with laws.  Stand your ground law in Florida.  I don't expect it.  But then don't argue with people that do know the fucking law like you know it. 
[00:12:00]  There are people saying, well, wasn't Trayvon, uh, can he say that he was standing his ground  because he felt threatened that he was being followed?  No.  You can't fucking use deadly physical force on someone because they're following you, you  dummy.  You can use deadly physical force if someone's pounding your head into the pavement and you,  you have the, uh, you have the idea that you are going to die. 
[00:12:30]  Then you can.  Then you're allowed.  So what started this whole thing at?  Uh, that story, I had to fucking, so, oh, all right.  Someone tweeted more Trayvon, uh, news, right?  Yeah.  And then there's the link to the story you're talking about.  And I said, holy witch hunt.  If true, he was eight years old.  Not, uh, no relevance to the case.  Which is more than fair, by the way.  And then people had to tell me, well, he wasn't eight during the whole thing.  Like, I think I understand how years and birthdays work.  Well, neither was she.  No, I, exactly. 
[00:13:00]  Yeah, just do the math.  Eight, eight and six.  Nine and seven, ten and eight, eleven and nine.  They're pretty much the same age.  Pretty much.  It falls into that thing of diddling when you're a kid.  You fuck around.  You do things.  It, it, and I said, if this is the case, uh, because somebody said, well, it shows there's  a character issue here.  And I go, all right.  Then how about we take all of Trayvon's tweets that were out there about his wannabe thug 
[00:13:30]  gangsta drug dealing and fucking, you know, use that as a character, uh, frame of reference.  Buh, buh, you're racist.  And then, and then everyone wants to call me a racist.  Because I point this shit out.  I point out the fucking, the shit that, uh, shouldn't be fucking even talked about.  It's, blow me.  It's more than fair what you did yesterday.  It really is.  I think it was a great, uh, and then it's horrible.  They're not mentioning how old he was.  And then some people go, Hey, Anthony, why, why do you bother doing this? 
[00:14:00]  Why not just relax?  And I'm like, okay, I had to tweet a picture of me where I was when I was tweeting all this.  I was poolside.  All right.  And then I get in between, uh, tweets.  I would take a dip.  I'd swim around.  I'd get out and then I tweet more.  So, uh, I'm okay.  I'm not, I'm not sitting there raving in front of a computer in a dark room, uh, very angry.  Well, I am angry, but yeah.  So this is, this whole story is, uh, more smoke and mirrors by, uh, mainstream media. 
[00:14:30]  Just this witch hunt that's going on when the, the fact of the matter is here, here's  the basic facts.  The guy, uh, was on neighborhood watch.  He sees somebody that he deems, uh, worthy of looking into a little further because that's  what he did.  He was a neighborhood watch guy.  When you're a neighborhood watch guy, you see someone walking through the neighborhood  that isn't familiar.  You might want to inquire or at least watch what they're doing. 
[00:15:00]  That's what they do.  Without the end result of Trayvon being shot, everything's fine, right?  Everything's fine up to that point.  He's watching the neighborhood.  Well, then apparently, uh, from what the witnesses say and from the beatings on, uh, each of the,  the, the people, he was, uh, attacked when he was attacked and felt that his life was  being threatened, which some of his wounds definitely, uh, show.  He pulled a gun out right before he shot Trayvon. 
[00:15:30]  He didn't brandish it.  He didn't pull it out on Trayvon.  And then Trayvon tried to attack him because he felt threatened with the guy with a gun.  He pulled it out at the last minute, shot him from inches away where he then died.  That's one version of the story.  This falls.  Yeah.  That's one version.  This falls into your ground.  Others would say differently.  Others would say, but what could they fucking say where, where the, um, the evidence shows  differently by witness testimony wounds, uh, uh, uh, the, where the bullet hit him, um, the 
[00:16:00]  flash, the, the powder burns on, on, uh, Trayvon's clothing.  It shows that the gun was used from inches away.  So a lot of these people aren't educating themselves and reading all this stuff.  And the law, the law gives George Zimmerman the opportunity to defend himself in that  situation.  And this is the stuff that will come out in the trial.  And, and if what I just put forth comes out in the trial and that's what happened, George 
[00:16:30]  Zimmerman will be acquitted.  He will be acquitted.  Whoa.  And so far, this is what the evidence shows.  Right.  The evidence does not show that George Zimmerman, uh, was, um, an instigator.  It doesn't show that he attacked Trayvon.  It shows that he was doing his job as a, uh, a neighborhood watch, a guard of his, his neighborhood.  And a lot of people also taking into consideration this 9-1-1 operator saying, don't follow him. 
[00:17:00]  He never said that.  George Zimmerman said, I'm going to follow him.  The 9-1-1 operator said, we don't need you to do that.  And the 9-1-1 operator has no authority whatsoever in telling anybody what they can or can't do.  They could give, uh, opinion.  They could give suggestions, but they don't have any legal right.  And you don't have any legal, um, uh, obligation to follow their orders. 
[00:17:30]  You're the best person in that situation to dictate what you should or shouldn't do.  And people are confusing that with an authority figure telling him not to follow Trayvon.  No.  Again, he's a neighborhood watch guy.  And, at that moment, testimony from him and witnesses say he was walking then back to his truck when Trayvon decided to, um, confront George Zimmerman.  Well, don't you have it all figured out?  I certainly have read a fuckload about this. 
[00:18:00]  I didn't just read news stories either.  I've pawed through police reports, witnessed testimony that was given to the police.  This is like the O.J. case where if you said to almost, this is split very much down racial lines.  Not 100%.  I think more white people think that he's, uh, guilty than black people think he isn't.  But if you talk to any black person, they're going to see it different.  And I'm not saying that that's right or wrong.  Very racially divided.  It's a racially divided case.  You're absolutely right. 
[00:18:30]  We kind of have these from time to time, right?  Yeah.  We certainly are, but I don't know why.  Why we can't just look at the fucking facts of, uh, of a case and, uh, and, and not throw all that pure emotion in.  I know people want to, but you can't when you're, especially if you're trying to argue a point in a public forum, you just come off sounding stupid.  You got 140 characters to make a point.  It's very difficult.  I find I have to block people sometimes because I know it's going to be a long night if I start, if I start trying to make little arguments, I just can't do it. 
[00:19:00]  Like with Tosh or whatever, I'm like, I, I, you know, I can't do it on Twitter.  Well, I mean, um, you know, the point today though is how they're not reporting how old he was.  That's crazy.  And they're the same fucking media that edited his, uh, fucking call.  Yeah.  Even if Zimmerman's guilty and he's a piece of shit, you can't edit the call.  No.  To make it look like he said what he didn't say.  Yeah.  And amazing how that went away.  But it just shows you what, know why it went away?  Because the media knows they do this all the time. 
[00:19:30]  They all do it.  It's not just with this story.  Yep.  They adjust the facts all the time in a way where they, you know, they could get away with it.  Yeah.  Because technically, if you think about technically, they did say how old he was, eh?  Technically they did.  On page two, all the way down.  Dig through and use a calculator.  But man, that headline is really important.  Yeah.  Yep.  Okay.  And they chose at that point, you know, not to put the age anywhere near the headline or the first couple of paragraphs.  So the Boston Herald reprints the Miami Herald story.  That's that they're all owned by the same company. 
[00:20:00]  The Boston Herald, however, did some choice editing to the first paragraph.  Oh.  Because I just read the original Miami Herald story.  Wow.  And is the Miami Herald the...  The Miami Herald story is the one that I've highlighted.  Is that...  No, no.  Is that the original, though, or did the Miami Herald come up with this?  No, that's the original story.  Wow.  What pigs.  The guy who wrote this article works for the Miami Herald.  And what he wrote was, despite a last-minute rush to the courthouse by the defense to keep a witness's damaging story out of public view, 
[00:20:30]  On Monday, prosecutors released a recorded statement from George Zimmerman's cousin who said he molested her for 10 years when they were both children, beginning when she was 6 years old.  Those motherfuckers edited out the import... 
[00:21:00]  ...eliminated from the article.  How is that?  For space?  Holy shit.  Yeah, for space.  Wow.  Five words.  What fucking pigs work in that industry?  Completely trying to alter the gist of the story to make him look worse. 
[00:21:30]  When they were both children was in the first paragraph of the Miami Herald story.  Boston Herald took it completely out.  So it just reads, molested her for 10 years, beginning when she was 6, not knowing what 10 years.  The last 10 years?  Maybe when they were both children.  We don't know.  Oh, my God.  Because they edited it out.  Unbelievable.  So you can't even take issue with the author here.  It's the editors at the Boston Herald.  Wow.  When they were both children, beginning when she was 6.  When they were both children makes a huge difference. 
[00:22:00]  Of course it does.  Between a fucking...  ...a typical thing when you're a kid and a predator.  Right.  The fucking editor at the Boston...  What a fucking pig.  Oh.  Wow.  Un-fucking-believable.  Even if someone's guilty and a complete piece of shit...  Right, right, right.  What?  I can't see...  I would...  And they never have to explain themselves.  No, they never have to explain themselves.  Never have to fucking say why they did that.  It's astounding what these fuckers get away with. 
[00:22:30]  While they're doing nothing but shitting on other people for not being perfect and being pricks and fucking everything.  That's their job.  Yet they are the most despicable fuckwads because they're twisting the truth around and people lap it up.  They lap it up.  Wow.  That makes me so angry.  I fucking...  When I saw this last night, I was living.  And it doesn't make me angry for Zimmerman because I don't care about him either way.  No, you're right.  But these are the same guys that target this, this, this. 
[00:23:00]  They're the same people.  You should be.  That's what they...  That's the media.  That's who they are.  You should be very pissed at this, regardless of Zimmerman, because this is the shit they're force-feeding you.  And unless you do a little research on your own, you'll never know this.  Good catch, Travis.  That's good.  Wow, that's fucking classic.  I would have found it if he didn't.  Of course.  They didn't have room for those five words.  That's all.  Five words in a three-page story.  What's five words if there's a lot of words in a story?  You gotta, you know, make room.  They chose those five words.  Wow. 
[00:23:30]  Wow.  It's no wow.  Seriously?  You can't be surprised.  But it's amazing when you catch them as blatantly.  I just hope we could educate more people that this shit goes on.  That's all.  Well, I try.  You can't be surprised.  I try.  This shit goes on all the fucking time.  And I'm called despicable, horrible things when I try to show people...  Well, it might be the way you tell people, though.  Well, maybe it is.  Let's go to your Twitter.  Let's see.  Maybe it is.  Were you keeping it high, bro?  Were you keeping it high, bro?  Sometimes I gotta...  Let's see what happens.  Sometimes I gotta put a few jokes in. 
[00:24:00]  Were you keeping it high, bro?  I don't think so.  No.  Where did it start?  Oh, man.  I went for quite a while last night.  You had a busy night, huh?  Yes, I did, indeed.  That was early evening, actually.  I was by the Puel.  And it was very nice out.  I was tweeting.  What have we got here?  Well.  Well.  There's just...  You know, it's Anthony Coomey on Twitter, if you want to read it.  But Zimmerman was told...  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  And here's one.  Hold on.  Stop right there. 
[00:24:30]  Wait, you're still scrolling?  It says...  How many tweets about this?  No, it was fuckload.  You need a blog, I think.  Fuckload.  You need a blog at this point, Ant.  I didn't enjoy how you took time out to just make a quick Seinfeld reference, and then  you went back to...  I had to.  It's a Ziggy.  What's the exact line they took out when they were both children?  Yeah, you got it.  Yes.  When they were both children.  There's one here, and this just goes to show you what I've got to deal with, with some  of these people.  It says, Zimmerman was told to stop following. 
[00:25:00]  It's an open and shut case.  That's the only detail that matters.  That was from Jim Norton's Twitter.  And I read that, and I go, don't you know that, no, that isn't the only detail that matters.  Wow.  And then somebody said, it's, I said, you know, they didn't, they didn't say his age.  And somebody said, it's stated in the article, try and read stupid.  And I said, no, it doesn't have, it's not stated in the article.  People won't just do the math to figure out how old he was. 
[00:25:30]  Sexually molesting her at age eight to, yeah.  He was eight.  I said, mention that in the article.  Yeah, this, so this, that's pretty much the gist of what these tweets were about.  But people just didn't want to, didn't want to acknowledge that the press was fucking this up.  They take their hatred of George Zimmerman and the situation and the racial thing.  And instead of saying, wow, yeah, the media fucked this one up, they just say, no, no, no, no. 
[00:26:00]  But meanwhile, you know, it's done all the time with stories that you probably want the facts of out.  Well, that's an important detail that you can't leave out.  A very important detail.  Of that story.  Dude, they don't get caught, they don't get caught this blatantly usually.  Like with Zimmerman, I guess everyone's looking at it, and now we have Google where you can compare stuff.  But the fact that they fucking got caught editing, that scumbag from NBC got caught editing, and Hannity murdered him for it.  They finally came out and fired the guy.  Of course they didn't name him. 
[00:26:30]  Of course they didn't name him because he's one of their own.  The NBC News organization is one of the, one of the, oh yeah, they're pretty good.  Yeah.  They have great program.  They're pretty good.  NBC News, horrible.  Football, their journalistic integrity, non-existent.  They are scumbags.  And I'm not, I literally could care less about Zimmerman.  It's just my hatred of the media.  Yep.  They are fucking, it's like, I would love to sit reporters down and go, is this what you got into it for?  Yeah, yeah. 
[00:27:00]  To be a tabloid scumbag like you are?  Like, is this what you went to journalism school for?  Story's not good enough, so let me just tweak it a little.  You're not supposed to create the story.  You're supposed to report it, not create it.  Accurately.  Oh my God.  And again, we've said it a million times, I know Fox is biased, but stop pretending they're the only ones.  It drives me fucking nuts.  Yeah, when they say.  I've never argued when someone said Fox is conservative.  Yep.  Yeah, they are.  They are.  Yeah. 
[00:27:30]  They are.  But then they're like, yeah, what, faux news?  You mean faux news?  Really?  Like that?  Like when they report somebody fucking molesting a six-year-old and don't report their age?  Fuckers.  They really are fucking dis-hickable.  And I'm sure people have plenty of things to say about my whole wrap-up of the Zimmerman-Trayvon thing there.  No, it's too early.  Loaded with facts, I'm sure. 
[00:28:00]  They'll yell at the replay later when they're awake.  Yeah.  Yeah, yeah.  That's true.  Yeah, that's bad, though.  Yeah.  I didn't realize that's how it was reported.  I just, honestly, the little I knew about that, I just assumed he was older.  I did.  Yeah.  Same.  Because they didn't just tell you.  They didn't come out and just tell you.  And when they put it on there, did you hear her talking?  They have tapes of her talking, going, yes, I was six.  And what he would do was put his hand under the blanket and touch.  And it sounds like him now. 
[00:28:30]  Maybe they edited her, too.  Maybe they edited, yeah.  She may have started off saying he was eight and...  I was six, yeah.  That's a big fucking difference.  It's a huge difference in the story.  Because no one, the perception you get immediately when someone says George Zimmerman in your head  because of what we've seen is George Zimmerman.  You think of that guy that we've seen in the mugshot and his pictures now in court and everything.  You don't think of instantly an eight-year-old George Zimmerman.  So when they say George Zimmerman molests a six-year-old cousin, you picture that guy, 
[00:29:00]  unless you're told different.  I'm sorry to interrupt you.  Can we get a picture?  No, no, no.  But about the Miami Herald story, can we get a photo?  We should put them up on the Facebook page immediately, side by side.  That whole, exactly what you had up there.  Can you get them from the actual paper?  Let's put them on the Facebook page.  Oh, yeah.  You can send people there.  Look at these side by side, the same fucking company.  Yeah.  They edit one editor, makes a decision to edit that out of somebody else's story. 
[00:29:30]  Unbelievable.  That is, wow.  That's where we are.  And it's not surprising.  What's surprising is to catch them doing it.  Because you always, like, you know, you always think these things and you think you're crazy  and paranoid for feeling this way.  Well, uh...  They're terrible.  Interestingly enough, I've not heard one person mention this yet.  No one's even talking about this yet.  They're not gonna.  As far as how the news is twisting this story around.  Usually someone mentions it, though. 
[00:30:00]  There's, you know, some conservative fucking blog will do it.  Well, I'm sure they'll talk...  No one's mentioned this yet.  Are they going to talk about this on the news programs today?  We'll see how they handle it.  We'll see how they handle it.  We'll see if they, uh, yeah.  Yeah.  Mention the ages and stuff.  All right.  Yeah.  Sounds like you had a busy night.  I had such a busy little night doing that.  It was, uh, terrible.  I do it all the time.  It's what I live for.  You love it.  Arguing.  You love it.  It's a hobby.  I love it. 
[00:30:30]  It's like, you know...  Is it a hobby, you think?  Uh, you know, Twitter for me is usually a nice, fun little thing.  Just put some funnies in there.  But, uh, occasionally I do, uh, like to take the reins and, uh, and educate.  I think your hobbies are, uh, drones?  Yes.  And racism.  Right now?  Yes.  That's it.  I end droning on about racism.  And then...  Right.  I do, uh, enjoy a good Colin Quinn, uh, string, though.  Yeah.  On that.  He's fucking great. 
[00:31:00]  Yeah.  Hey, you know...  See, hey, someone...  I just hacked Colin's Twitter and he's appearing here.  Colin is too self-effacing to promote his genius, but...  But Colin wrote it.  Oh, Danny.  I don't know if he did, though.  People block him.  I'm not really sure.  You know, you were funny once.  They'll bash the shit out of him.  When he was talking about Breaking Bad and how he doesn't like it because it glorifies drugs.  And people believe him.  Yeah.  They believe the tweets.  You know, you're an idiot. 
[00:31:30]  It's a great show.  He's like, ah, I don't think much.  He's just playing the Malcolm in the Middle dad character.  Or the goatee, right?  Yeah.  Or the mustache.  Goatee this season.  Goatee.  Goatee this season.  Goatee.  I saw goatee.  What happened to this sad mustache?  Well, he's not that guy anymore.  I understand that.  That's for sure.  Yeah.  Man with world's largest willy and security scare at airport.  People tweet me.  They thought his dick was a weapon? 
[00:32:00]  I guess so.  Yeah, that happened to me.  Well-endowed Jonah Falcon.  Might as well read it.  It's here.  From New York.  Was stopped at San Francisco International Airport by eagle-eyed officials.  He was extensively frisked and had white powder sprinkled on his pants to check for  traces of explosives after a very noticeable bolt in his clothing was interpreted as a  potential biological threat. 
[00:32:30]  A biological threat?  It could be.  Spraying that seed all over.  Mr. Falcon was previously featured in an HBO documentary about the size of his manhood,  which measures nine inches limp and 13 and a half inches when aroused.  Yippee-ki-yay, Mr. Falcon.  Wow.  Mr. Falcon rules.  He said I had my stuff strapped to the left.  I wasn't erect at the time.  Back on to the left.  One of the guards asked if my pockets were empty and I said yes.  I said it's my dick. 
[00:33:00]  This is a great article, man.  He gave me a pat-down but made sure to go around my penis with his hands.  Nine inches limp.  They even put some powder on my pants, probably a test for explosives.  I found it amusing.  Another guard stopped me and asked if I had some sort of growth.  Yes.  Watch it grow.  He aroused suspicions on his way to New York.  He said I'm just going to wear bike shorts from now on. 
[00:33:30]  That way they'll know.  You'd think they would have experience with hung guys before, but I guess not.  Oh, you braggart.  Everybody's got nine limbs.  Dude, when you're on a documentary about your dick, that's why he's not mad?  What guy is mad because your cock is so big it's seen as a threat to the Pentagon?  Homeland Security knows about your dick.  Do you know how many times I've tried to point at my cock in line at the airport, hoping that somebody would think it's a weapon?  But they don't.  He became famous in 1999 due to the size of his willy. 
[00:34:00]  Now, is this the guy we had on the show?  I don't know.  Remember him?  No, it's a white guy, and at N.E.W., we had a guy, but I think that guy was even more than 13 inches.  Well, you've got to go limp, right?  Because he didn't get tugging on him all the time.  We had a guy come in to our WN.E.W. show in bike shorts.  Yeah.  He had the longest fucking dick ever.  It was down his pant leg.  Like the top of his knee. 
[00:34:30]  Remember we brought the girls in, and they were just out of their minds.  Oh, they were giggling.  They were laughing at the guy.  They were chuckling and giggling.  And he takes it very seriously.  He got really pissed off.  He was not fun at all.  Yeah.  You'd think if you had a big dick, you'd have a little fun with it.  No, I do.  He was kind of bummed out that people were giggling at him.  Can you find that picture, E-Rock, where somebody out there has to have it?  It was definitely posted.  What's this guy look like, Travis?  Jonah, what's his name?  He's just a white guy.  No, this guy Jonah, is he the guy?  Is he a white dude?  Yeah.  He's a white guy.  I'm trying to think if it's the same guy. 
[00:35:00]  Because that's about the time we had that guy.  Oh, man, it is.  Is it him?  That's him.  That's the same guy?  That's him.  Yep.  That's the guy.  If you could find the time he was in.  Nine soft.  N-E-W.  I remember he had white bicycle shorts.  He was wearing bicycle shorts.  And he got in trouble walking around on the streets.  Right.  They told him to cover up.  And the women were howling.  His fucking big dick threw his pants.  How can they?  But you know what?  That's a really weird line.  Like, you can't say one citizen can wear something and another citizen can't because 
[00:35:30]  his dick is big.  Citizen.  I don't think he was arrested right now.  Put away your dick.  They told him to.  Look at this.  Yeah, that's the guy.  What a tool.  That's the guy.  Huge tool.  But look at his fucking...  That's the guy.  I'm looking...  I can't stop looking at his face.  What a fat head.  He is really a big, fat lunk head.  That's definitely the guy.  That's him.  He didn't really have fun with it when he was on our show.  Of course it was San Francisco.  Because they probably knew it wasn't.  They probably wanted to go over and just poke it. 
[00:36:00]  Oh, yeah.  Poke it.  Put their mouths on it.  He straps it or no?  No.  He just puts it down his pant leg.  Oh.  Well, call a booty ONA.  Thank you for that.  Call a booty.  Call a booty helping us out with that.  That's my manager getting stopped with his giant dick.  His big dick or balls.  Yeah.  We're not quite sure.  And we definitely know this guy.  I would love to see the NW pictures if we could find it.  Someone out there has them.  They were definitely posted on Foundry Music at the time.  Foundry Music.  Yeah. 
[00:36:30]  Yes.  By the way, the fund for Steve has been set up.  Oh, good.  Thank you, EROC.  EROC worked very hard on this.  Or other people, too?  Or EROC?  It was EROC.  Wow.  The EROC commemorative.  Steve Carlisi info.  The Carlisi Fund.  To donate to Steve's family, Steve left behind a two-year-old, a wife, and a stepdaughter  who's 16 or 17, I believe.  We got all the info on our Facebook page.  But basically, it's tinyurl.com slash stevecfund.  That's pretty easy to remember. 
[00:37:00]  We all know tiny URLs at this point.  tinyurl.com slash stevecfund.  Also, because MJ really wants a record of what people thought of Steve for her son, Xander.  Send your thoughts and stories about Steve to his family.  These will be saved and given to his son.  Remember stevec at gmail.com.  All this is on our Facebook page.  EROC, send me the link.  Twitter me that link.  And I'll retweet it. 
[00:37:30]  You're all going to tweet this as well.  Of course, yeah.  On Facebook, we're Opie and Anthony, one word.  And all that info is up there.  And I heard from people like, is there anything else I could do because I'm dirt poor?  Just saying that was cool enough.  There's enough people in our community that have a few bucks that they could help out Steve's family.  Just the thought that you wanted to help is good enough for me, man.  Yeah.  One guy was like, I'll do anything, but I don't have any money. 
[00:38:00]  It's like, just you saying that is good enough for me.  Go steal some money.  Give us a few bucks.  Go hit an old lady with a wrench.  And you don't have to give a fuckload.  Nah.  Five bucks is like, you know, I understand five dollars is, what, a pack of cigarettes?  What?  Maybe a cup of coffee.  Half a pack?  Half a pack of cigarettes.  That's right.  Yeah, I know.  You want to tease for the next break?  Are we breaking ready?  No, but I'm just, it's not going to be this break.  I don't give a fuck.  What have we got?  I have the Glenn Beck audio. 
[00:38:30]  Oh, nice.  Oh, yeah, let's break before that.  Oh, me, me, me.  Any time I say oh now, I just think oh.  Have we met?  Yes.  Okay.  Chip at Comic-Con day two.  We haven't even gotten through day one.  You did a lot.  All right.  I'm very busy.  I work very hard.  Hard on.  Jim and the Celebrities at Comic-Con.  Nice.  That's going to be part of the special this weekend?  Yeah.  And, oh, yeah, we got to get to the Louis C.K. audio.  I have not heard this. 
[00:39:00]  I haven't yet either.  I want to thank the Twitterverse for turning me on to the same.  Louis did a great job with the whole Daniel Tosh thing on The Daily Show.  And we got the audio of that, too.  Dark Knight Rises today.  We're seeing that today?  Yes, motherfuckers.  Which one are you going to?  I'm going to the Dark Knight movie.  What time, though?  I'm going to.  I'm going at the 2 o'clock.  I guess I'll go there, too.  The 2 o'clock showing because you know what?  Better to be in an air-conditioned movie theater.  The heat's going to be just stifling.  I think it's going to be good. 
[00:39:30]  I'm going to the Dark Knight.  I'm going to yell, what is it, a Dark Day, too?  Fucking place will go nuts.  They will.  That's what they're, you know, throwing you out.  Yeah, Batman.  I'm going to say, what, do you work for the Yankees or something?  Ah.  Are they going to pull that phone shit again?  Where they fucking take your phone away?  I don't know.  That would be a lot of phones because this is in, like, the actual IMAX theater.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I'm going to put, I'm going to have Jonah fucking whatever his name is walk my phone in behind  his cock. 
[00:40:00]  That'd be great.  I'd be all his friends.  He's got six phones behind his big limp dick.  I don't think so.  I would love to be stopped in security because of my penis.  Just once.  I want someone to think my penis is dangerous for other reasons than it actually is.  So you want a dangerous penis?  Yeah.  Not just because it's a dispenser of unpleasant things.  Jesus.  It's a fucking cone-shaped Petri dish.  It's a dirty bomb. 
[00:40:30]  You find the pictures of that guy from WNEW?  No.  I'm going to look during the break.  One of the super fans.  I know you got the pictures.  Send them in.  Super fans.  Because I want to sit in his dumb white shorts again.  We fucking just openly laughed at the guy.  So maybe it was our problem.  I don't know.  He was a dick.  No pun.  He wasn't fun.  He was.  Yeah.  We brought all the sales girls.  Remember?  We can't even do that bit today.  We were giggling.  Oh, no.  That was a throwaway thing.  Like, hey, we got a guy with a big dick.  We don't really give a fuck except for, you know, it's a sideshow thing, obviously. 
[00:41:00]  But let's get some girls down here.  So we put the word out.  Walk in the halls.  It might have been stinky going, all right, who wants to see a big dick?  It's going to go down on the ONA show today.  And we had a studio filled with women.  And then the guy kind of just, I don't even know if he pulled it out.  I have no idea.  I don't remember.  No, I don't think he kept it.  I don't think he did either.  Oh, he did it at some point, but not in front of the girls.  I don't think.  I don't know if he did.  No, I remember him grabbing it and tugging it.  But maybe he was doing that through the bicycle shorts.  No, he was doing it.  And then the girls were laughing their balls off and they went back to their jobs and no 
[00:41:30]  one fucking went to HR or any of that shit.  I guarantee we wouldn't be able to do that today.  Even that.  Even if the guy keeps the dumb thing in his fucking bicycle shorts.  Jesus.  Bicycle shorts don't look good on anyone, man.  No, especially when it's a big fucking billy club in your pants.  I love my fucking bike shorts.  You wear bike shorts?  I never wear bike shorts.  I don't wear them anywhere.  And I bike a lot.  But I want to.  I don't have the guts to.  Yeah.  All right. 
[00:42:00]  Lots to do.  Stay there.  All right.  From Dallas, Texas, the flash, apparently official, President Kennedy died at 1 p.m. Central Standard  Time, 2 o'clock Eastern Standard Time, some 38 minutes ago.  So, I guess Kennedy died today?  Why don't we all know that's November?  What? 
[00:42:30]  Did the movie come out today?  25 years ago?  Just looking at the prep sheet, I think I know what he's going for.  Walter Cronkite died?  Oh, wow.  Three years ago at the age of 92.  I got it.  It's the most famous news piece.  Yeah?  Is it still the most famous news piece, you think?  Yeah, it's pretty famous.  Pretty famous.  I was trying to think of something to bash him on, but.  Pretty famous.  It's pretty goddamn famous.  Yeah, it's pretty famous.  My bladed red-dreaded. 
[00:43:00]  The OJ verdict?  Pretty famous.  Pretty famous.  9-11?  Pretty famous, but a lot of media out that day.  That's true.  Yeah, there's no one.  Right.  Yeah, that was pretty much it.  Like with the OJ thing, everyone had to shut their fucking yaps and listen.  That's why that's pretty famous.  I remember we stopped high school.  Like, everybody watched that.  Like, and that's the only time that I can remember, like, everybody just, you know, focusing  on the same thing.  It was that big.  I was a senior at. 
[00:43:30]  The OJ verdict.  I was a senior at SUNY Geneseo.  And classes.  Really?  Yeah.  Interesting.  Classes stopped.  Well, that makes sense, because I was like a junior in high school.  Yeah.  I remember.  Yeah.  I was a senior.  No?  Senior at SUNY Geneseo.  Bunch of bullshit.  And Dr. Green's class.  And it was a media class, so it was perfect.  And we all just sat there and watched.  Dr. Green.  Is that true?  Yeah.  Was he envious?  Ah, chipper.  Green with envy all the time.  We got the Voss audio.  I want to hear this.  From the Glenn Beck program. 
[00:44:00]  Glenn Beck making a fucking lot of money.  Yeah, apparently.  But wait, is this the $100 million deal he got, or has he not started that yet?  Iraq?  I don't think he started that yet.  I think that his contract's running out soon, and then that new one kicks in.  But then what is this whole network thing he does?  This is a little side thing?  No, this is...  He's still syndicated with Premiere.  So he's syndicated with Premiere.  Then he does something else where you have to...  He does his own TV show.  He has his online TV network.  So was this on his online TV show? 
[00:44:30]  I believe this was on his radio show.  Oh, so then this audio was easy to get?  Well, it was easy for us to get.  No, a lot of talk show hosts.  Now you have to buy their audio in order to get their shows.  Right.  So he does a radio show, and then he does a TV show, and that's what you have to go for.  Yes.  Wow, he's fucking rich.  I want to hear this now.  Um, for a long time, they were, you know, Opie and Anthony. 
[00:45:00]  How was that?  Well, that always is bad.  What is that?  Why is it like, uh, clipping?  It's clippy.  I think it's called click.  Yeah.  It's like it's noise-gated too high.  Is that going to fuck up the whole clip?  I can re-burn it for you.  Let me see.  I just, I don't know what our guy thinks is.  For a long time, they were, you know, they were, they were, they were, they were a show  in New York that, you know, would put people having sex on in, uh.  They did a lot of things.  Yeah, they did a lot of things. 
[00:45:30]  That was one of them.  Thank you for saying that was just one of them.  All right.  Glenn Beck, let's, uh, let's go back to your early days of radio, where you were a morning  zoo guy.  You want to play the commercial for everybody?  He was a zoo guy.  Where there were chickens falling from the studio ceiling and you had wacky horns and  all sorts of crap.  Everyone has to start somewhere.  That's right.  We all have a past.  Yeah.  I'm not going to let him slide on that.  But he didn't.  He said other things.  No, the other guy had to say the other things.  See there.  There you go.  Start this over.  Wow.  That's good.  Start this over. 
[00:46:00]  Wow.  Morning zookeepers, Glenn Beck and Tim Hattray.  We told our bosses right up front, we'd all need gimmicks to sell the new Y95.  We've got a better mix of music.  Great DJs who don't yak too much.  Plenty of easy contests for you to win lots of free money.  And more continuous music.  Plus a new morning zoo with us.  Glenn and Tim.  Y95 Airborne Traffic Report.  And special zoo guests.  An actual monkey in the studio.  We're going to talk from the new Y95 who needs gimmicks.  The new Y95 needs music and a few gimmicks.  All right. 
[00:46:30]  That's actually not a bad commercial because they're mocking that stuff.  They are, but they're doing it.  They are doing it.  So shut your mouth, Glenn Beck.  He looked pretty funny.  Shut your mouth.  You have a pass too, sir.  Now that's going to get back to him now.  I don't give a fuck.  He was telling him to shut your mouth.  All right.  That's how shit like...  How about we start a radio war?  You know when people say that to us?  It's like, dude, this guy was fucking bashing you.  And then you listen and go, oh, he wasn't bashing us at all.  You know, I mean, we did what we did.  And he was a wacky morning zoo guy. 
[00:47:00]  I wonder what his partner's doing now.  I don't know.  I think we try to find him.  Or we try to find out.  Do you think he's as successful as Glenn Beck?  Nah, no one knows.  Maybe if someone knows who...  Tim Hattrick.  Hattrick is.  All right.  They did a lot of things.  Yeah, they did a lot of things.  That was one of them.  But you know what?  Lately, they've been making an awful lot of good points.  All right.  And here they are with...  What's the name of this comedian?  Rich Voss.  I can't even... 
[00:47:30]  I can't do this to see her that name.  Oh, boy.  Look, and then Rich gets upset.  And I'm going to have to deal with a phone call later.  Let's just start by going, Rich, you're dumb.  But Rich does great radio for us.  And he's a very, very funny comic.  He really is.  Yeah.  Oh, boy.  This isn't going to be good.  Rich Voss.  Rich Voss.  Talking about Obamacare.  Audio you need to hear.  Here's what I wanted to ask you. 
[00:48:00]  And this is serious.  Because I'm a little...  A little to the right, some to the left on some issues.  I pay $20,000 a year in health insurance.  I pay $20,000.  That's about right.  Why is it bad?  Why should we not have health care?  I don't understand the good and bad points.  You're still going to pay $20,000.  It doesn't matter.  You're still going to pay it.  How am I going to pay $20,000 on...  Because this isn't giving people health care.  It's making people get health care.  And this isn't giving people free health care.  This whole f***ing thing.  Everybody's under the impression that this Obama thing is giving people health care. 
[00:48:30]  It's not.  It's making it that you now have to get health care.  Thank you.  Well, then they're saying that the insurance companies have to drop their prices.  Do they?  They're not going to drop their prices.  If they regulate it.  If.  When.  So, well, then how is the whole country being tricked thinking they're getting free health care?  I think a lot of people think this Obamacare thing means free health care.  And it doesn't.  They don't know.  People are dumb motherf***ers. 
[00:49:00]  And when they hear s*** like this, Obama wants to give every American health care insurance.  It's like, no.  He wants us all to have health care insurance.  And if you don't, then the IRS is going to come knocking at your door for your s***ing tax money.  A lot of people were yelling on Twitter after that, Ant.  Saying it's not the IRS.  They're full of s***.  It is the IRS.  I just want to bring it up, though.  The IRS is in charge of collecting these penalties slash taxes.  The IRS is buried so deep in this Obamacare thing that, and they shouldn't be, 
[00:49:30]  the Internal Revenue Service has no business being in your health care business.  Okay, but you're saying, okay, so I guess I am ignorant.  So you're saying.  I curse a lot.  I don't realize until there's beeps in it, I don't realize.  And then I hear all the beeps, and I'm like, wow, I really do.  I curse a lot.  It's just casual conversation.  That's how people talk.  You don't even think of it.  In your health care business. 
[00:50:00]  Okay, but you're saying.  Okay, so I guess I am ignorant.  So you're saying that no one's getting free health care out of this.  No, you're right.  Genius.  This guy is as dumb as a box of rocks.  Okay, okay, all right.  So you're saying over there.  This is really what.  Yeah, that's what I say.  This is what's going to happen to the rest of the country, too.  The rest of the country is like.  So, so, so, so, so, so.  So, so, so, then, then, then, then, then, then, then, then, then, then, then, then, then. 
[00:50:30]  You say, wait, wait, wait.  Now, bro.  Now, wait, wait.  Wait.  You got free health care.  Okay?  I paid $20,000 for health care.  Okay?  So I'm obviously making some cash over here.  So I made $20,000 a year in health care.  Okay?  I want the free stuff.  I want free stuff.  Yeah, so I'm ready for my free health care over here, Barack.  I'm not going to even ask who's paying for the free health care.  I don't care.  Just so it's not me.  It ain't me. 
[00:51:00]  It ain't me.  I'm not paying for it.  I'll tell you that right now.  I ain't paying for it.  I ain't paying.  And, you know, you got to, the insurance company's got to lower the price.  So, so you got that.  Like, they already haven't.  Wait.  Wait.  Wait.  They got to, they got to lower the prices.  So, you know, it's like the dairy farmers.  You know, if I say I want everybody to have free milk, okay, then that means they got to  lower the price of the milk.  And they're just going to find the way to feed the cows and keep them and keep them warming 
[00:51:30]  and ship them out to me because I want my free milk.  That's an honest moment there, though.  I mean, he's.  It's a stupid.  It is.  But how many.  These are the people canceling out your votes, America.  These are the people.  Play the Harry Truman thing.  These are the people that actually buy into things like this from Barack Obama.  Wow.  Wow.  Bravo to Glenn Beck.  That's really funny. 
[00:52:00]  Oh, man.  That's just funny.  Dar.  Even if you don't agree with what Glenn Beck has to say, that's funny.  That was goddamn funny.  That's a great take on Rich Voss.  He does exactly what we do.  Here's the thing.  They didn't pick up on here's the thing, I guess.  The great thing is he only needed a minute of Rich Voss to be able to just go off on Rich.  Although, here's the thing.  And then people were trying to tell Rich, you know, that Glenn Beck was talking about him 
[00:52:30]  and he couldn't wrap his head around the concept.  Yeah, that's when he tweeted.  He tweeted.  I got to find the tweet.  He just didn't understand.  He tweeted, what are you saying?  Yeah, what are you talking about?  And I dubbed it one of the most ironic tweets ever.  Oh, there you go.  He just writes, what are you talking about?  What are you talking about?  What are you talking about?  And the guy was, his tweet was simple.  I think I could find it.  It was, eat at Bobo's. 
[00:53:00]  Oh, that's wonderful.  Eat at Bobo's wrote to Rich, this morning, Beck was playing you talking about Obamacare.  Trash Rich for being so stupid for about 20 minutes.  And then Rich goes, what are you talking about?  That's what he's talking about.  That's exactly what he's talking about.  He's older.  You're a dummy.  And then, wow, Glenn Beck is playing clips of the show and killing Voss.  And Voss, what are you talking about? 
[00:53:30]  That's pretty good.  There's more.  Oh, great.  I just figured we'd take a little breather.  Oh, nice.  I hope there's no more fun poking at Rich.  You made a valid point about health care.  A little breather.  That was hilarious.  I do love that your reaction was, whether you agree or disagree with Glenn Beck, he has  a great take on Voss.  He wasn't supposed to pick up on that.  Oh, we're getting jock-tobered.  Steve L73 is telling me.  We're getting jock-tobered.  We're using our own bid against us. 
[00:54:00]  They are jock-tobering.  Things like this.  You know, Harry Truman said, the buck stops with you.  What?  First of all, he started to say, the bus stops.  Yes, he did.  Yeah, the bus stops here.  The bus stops here over there.  The bus stops here for my house and my treatment center.  The bus stops next stop for my treatment center. 
[00:54:30]  The buck stops with you.  The buck stops here.  That's the guy who's like, I want my free health care because the buck stops with you.  And I'm putting the George Bush over there right now.  That's right.  It stops with you, George Bush over there.  I saw the Harry Truman show, okay?  I don't remember that part, but he said the buck stops with you.  It was a guy who was trapped in the bubble over there.  They were watching him his whole life over there. 
[00:55:00]  And that was wrong.  I seen that.  And that's what the Republicans want to do to you.  They don't want you to have health care and they're going to trap poor Harry Truman in that bubble  and show his life for entertainment.  Never be able to leave your hometown.  You like that?  You know why?  Because he's sick.  I saw him with John Travolta.  I saw him in that bubble.  They were watching him the whole time because he's sick.  And the Republicans want you to be sick.  And then they put him in a show.  Poor Harry Truman. 
[00:55:30]  Alone.  Let me tell you something.  He was right.  The buck stops with you.  Don't you want to be able to talk to your idiot friend like that, though?  Yes.  I do.  I do talk to my idiot friend like that.  You just want to unleash on them.  And you feel like, at times, the only way to reach somebody like that, who's gone through three years of debate on this bill.  There's been three years of nonstop news coverage and he still thinks he's getting free health care. 
[00:56:00]  Are you telling me that you haven't unleashed on your stupid friends?  You just want to.  Well, you have to.  Yeah, I have.  Have you unleashed on your stupid friend yet?  No, I don't remember you doing it to me.  Have you unleashed on a stupid friend?  Because I have.  And it always starts the same way.  Like, somebody will say something to me and all I do is I take my glasses and I first put, this has happened to me like three times. 
[00:56:30]  I've just gone.  When I put my hand over my mouth and then my hand goes up to my eyes and I rub my eyes for a minute and my wife will say, you don't want to have this conversation with him.  And then I look at my wife and say, no, no, no, no, no.  I need to have this conversation.  What the hell is wrong with you?  Yeah.  Where have you been, you dope?  So, wait a minute.  So, wait.  So, it's.  He's losing me a little bit.  You know, I like the.  That's where we have to come in. 
[00:57:00]  How to get off on the rich.  Yeah.  We got to pump this up a little bit.  The best part.  Yeah.  Of this whole thing is that Voss wants nothing more than for someone like Glenn Beck or Hannity.  Oh, right.  To quote him and think he's smart.  Yeah.  Now, this gentleman brings up a good point.  What's his name?  Rich Voss?  Rich Voss?  Yes.  He brings up a great point about health care.  Here's the thing.  Rich desperately wants one of these guys.  You are so right.  To go.  Good point, Rich. 
[00:57:30]  Well said.  The only time Glenn Beck ever mentions him.  Yeah.  Is to mock him and call him borderline retarded.  Like we do on this show.  Yes.  Exactly like we do.  I'm hoping he goes back to it.  Not what I'm hearing on TV.  Oh, man.  Listen to my wife.  You do not want to have this conversation.  Yeah.  I had that conversation with my sister and brother-in-law about two years ago.  We voted for Barack Obama.  I was like, wait. 
[00:58:00]  What?  Okay.  We went through this in the 90s with Clinton.  You found out you were wrong then.  So you voted for Bush twice.  And then you vote for Barack Obama, a communist?  Oh, Jesus.  Well, we thought he was just for the little guy.  Ah!  Ah!  Oh, I couldn't.  Oh.  I mean, God help you.  If you happen to be sitting at a table with me and there's a fork at the table and you say  things like this to me, I'm going to stab you right in the eye. 
[00:58:30]  I am.  Get away.  Get away from me.  Get away from my table.  Get away.  Get away.  I don't want to talk to you anymore.  No one will see you.  Get away.  I chase people out of restaurants with a fork.  Get away.  Get out of the restaurant.  All right.  And sometimes you feel like, well, you know, probably the better way to handle this is  come up with a reason.  Yeah.  I mean, we could have edited this a little bit.  No.  And keep it calm.  That raises a good point because Ronnie is for the little guy.  You.  And I don't really want to go deep because as soon as you start talking to me about deep 
[00:59:00]  stuff, I'm editing on the fly.  I'm not going to go deep.  I'm going to go deep.  I'm going to go deep.  $8,000 back and still have a great health care over there.  Might be back to it over here.  Let's take a look over here.  Just interested in about 45 seconds in this conversation.  So I just really wanted to kind of sponge off of you and not really know it myself.  Get out.  Give me a fork, honey.  Get out.  Well, the thing is over there, Glenn, I'm paying 20,000 bucks a year for my health care 
[00:59:30]  and I don't want to do that no more.  So what's the problem?  What's the problem with getting that 20,000 bucks back and still have a great health care  over there?  Let me tell you something, okay?  I want to have my cake and I want to eat it too.  I want to be, I want to frost it all over my face.  I want to have cake in my, in my belly.  And I want to be all fat and happy and I want to have cake in front of me too, okay?  That's all I want.  That's all I'm asking for.  All I'm asking for is free, universal, cure me of cancer. 
[01:00:00]  Go ahead and come up with all this great research for brain cancer and everything else.  I want all of that.  I want all of that and I want it all for free.  Yeah.  Because I'm not even paying taxes.  And I still believe I'm owed free stuff.  Yeah.  The funny thing too is this guy's a, you know, a successful comedian.  He's going to probably pay the exact same thing he's paying now, plus all the taxes, 
[01:00:30]  because he's going to be paying the bill for everybody else too.  Yeah.  Well, and that's what he doesn't know.  Well, who's paying for that, Rich?  You.  I don't know.  The Obama ferry.  I don't know.  How do people not ask that question when it comes for free?  Tell me the thing that is free.  Who pays?  Somebody pays what's going to be Exxon.  In time they start paying their first year.  Oh, okay.  Okay.  All right.  So then what do they do for money?  Well, they got enough. 
[01:01:00]  Do you know that they make a, they have a smaller profit margin than Apple?  No, it's not even close.  Not even close.  Not even close.  They pay more in taxes by themselves than the large percentage of the population.  Like, all right.  Really?  Fucking Exxon's taking a beating?  Well, they do have an agenda.  And again, I'm listening to this and I understand it's about teasing Voss and not debating back on healthcare.  But all right.  It gets to be a little bit.  It's like, do you really, do you have to fucking toe the line that completely? 
[01:01:30]  Well, it's the only way that the other side is counteracted.  Yeah, I understand.  I don't like any of them doing it.  It's just, come on.  It's not even close.  Not even close.  Not even close.  They pay more in taxes by themselves than the large percentage of the population.  That's right.  They can still pay more and they won't even notice it gone, huh?  And if they have out of business, well, they're bad for us anyway.  By the way, have you seen the prices of gas? 
[01:02:00]  You know, this is an outrage.  We've got to hit those car companies and those oil companies because this is an outrage.  You know what?  I think we should borrow.  Barack Obama is promising me a dollar a gallon gas.  All right?  A dollar a gallon.  I want the dollar a gallon gas and I want the free health insurance.  And if you've seen the price of houses, you can't trust these damn banks.  I should have a free house.  And you know how you get a dollar a gallon over there?  You tax ExxonMobil more money. 
[01:02:30]  That's what you do.  You want free houses?  I'll tell you how to get free houses.  You take the money away from Citibank.  That's what you do.  You take it away from Citibank and ExxonMobil.  We got free houses.  We have free gasoline.  And then you get those insurance companies and you screw them into the ground.  We have free health care.  It's all free.  And by the way, I only want to work a 20-hour work week.  And when I say work, I mean show up.  Sometimes.  It's genius.  Oh, yeah. 
[01:03:00]  Because that is what it is.  The entire green thing is based exactly on his attitude there, which is like, I don't  see why we wouldn't want, like, solar energy.  And you're like, all right, well, why wouldn't we want energy from the sun for free?  I'm like, well, that is so true, man.  It's like, that's how he wins.  That's what you have to overcome.  When nobody has to pay for the wind over there, it just blows, right?  Nobody's paying for that.  You put up a windmill and all of a sudden you got power. 
[01:03:30]  Why?  I don't know why we just don't get our free cheese from the moon.  But that's the argument people made about the war.  We're going to have to pay for it.  He's making the same argument the liberals made about the fucking war.  They say the moon is made of cheese.  Why don't we just go to the moon and get cheese?  That's kind of the same argument, though.  Yeah.  They're all, and I mean all of them, these pundits are such.  Well, it started out as fun.  It is funny.  Just beating up Rich Voss.  That is hilarious.  That makes us smile every time.  Poor Rich.  Then they went into their thing. 
[01:04:00]  Yeah, they're doing their thing.  They're doing their thing, but I wish they would have kept on the Voss thing a little  more.  They beat him pretty good, though.  Hey, over there.  The beginning of that's great.  All right.  Hey, over there.  Over there.  He really is a dumbbell.  Let's not forget, live broadcast.  We're going to Chicago.  Chicago.  Yes.  My kind of town.  I hope we pick the right spot, because then someone on Twitter got me a little paranoid.  Oh, I read that.  You know it's 115 blocks from downtown, and there's no subways that go out there, so you're 
[01:04:30]  going to be broadcasting to nobody.  It's always somebody that's got to say something.  But then other people are like, holy shit, that's a perfect location.  I don't know.  Yeah.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I know it's right.  Well, everybody drives out there.  I'm assuming it's not like New York.  The place is called 115 Bourbon Street.  It's on West 115th Street in Marionette Park, right outside Chicago.  And they have us here from 4 to 6, I don't know, or starting at 3.30, doors open at 3.  I mean, I don't know. 
[01:05:00]  Then we should do an hour broadcast.  But we'll go from 4 to 4.15.  What the fuck are we doing?  They think...  They're worried that we're going to do something stupid.  They think the proper broadcast should be two hours.  That's ridiculous.  It's ridiculous.  I already told them at least two and a half hours.  We should do a three- or four-hour broadcast.  That's what I get paid to do is a fucking broadcast.  They want us to show up.  Because you show up at 4.  We'll take a break.  Go to 4.10.  They say, because you missed a conversation.  I don't know why I'm doing this, because it's just going to drive Jimmy batting.  I had the conversation with them. 
[01:05:30]  Where, you know, the first two hours are always just over-the-top amazing with some great energy.  And then it kind of starts to teeter off a bit.  Great, because that's what we want making our creative decisions.  It starts to kind of just...  It kind of runs out of steam, I believe they said.  Yeah.  Well, that's who we want making those creative decisions.  So we as a show should go, well, we're glad you feel that.  By the way, we're either doing three hours or we're not doing...  I wouldn't ever allow them to make those decisions.  I refuse to get mad.  It's just silliness at this point. 
[01:06:00]  Everything's just silly.  I want to do two-hour broadcasts.  It's a fucking waste.  Two-hour broadcasts.  I said at least two and a half.  I said, let's cut the difference.  We should just tell them what we're doing.  We don't have to ask them.  That is true.  We start to ask too much.  Let's do a six-hour show.  Let's do a six-hour show.  Yeah.  I can't picture other radio shows going out and doing two hours.  It's fucking embarrassing.  Yeah.  We should do more, man.  It's ridiculous.  Well, we're at the helm.  We could do whatever the fuck we want. 
[01:06:30]  Oh, we should.  Well, right now, it's going to start with the pre-show.  It's Sam Roberts at 3.30.  Doors open at 3.  Why would you say, ugh?  Oh, no.  It was something...  I saw something on the console.  Sam, he's obsessively hating on you.  Figure it out.  I don't think...  I think he saw a cockroach.  He doesn't like you.  He doesn't like you.  I did.  I saw something on the console.  Oh, that's...  Go ahead.  All the info is on our Facebook page.  Open Anthony, one word.  So can we pop that to the top again today there, Iraq?  Let's keep...  Isn't there a spot on Facebook where you just put it?  I don't know.  No, Facebook.  For my own shit, I don't even know. 
[01:07:00]  Can't there be one spot where you're...  Boom.  Facebook does suck, doesn't it?  I want to leave this right here and still fucking update my Facebook page.  No, because it always gets buried.  But why can't they have one lousy spot?  Give everyone one nice little spot on their page where they can keep something.  That was called MySpace.  Yeah, MySpace had that, right?  I know.  You'd log on to MySpace and hear fucking 20 videos start up.  CNN, clever.  Lynn or out. 
[01:07:30]  Lynn or out.  That's clever.  Oh, boy.  That's a bit racist because I think that's how Asian people would say in.  No.  There's no L there for R.  Lynn or out.  Five to seven broadcast, East Coast.  What the fuck are we doing?  Really?  Yeah.  It's like me headlining a show and going, hey, come on down.  I'm going to do 20 minutes.  It's not what I'm paid for.  Well, 20 of your minutes is worth an hour and a half of anyone else.  That's actually me doing my best stuff three times. 
[01:08:00]  So it's Friday, August 10th, 115 Bourbon Street.  The time, we might figure some different things out.  But definitely doors open at 3.  Pre-show starts at 3.30.  All the info on our Facebook page and SiriusXM.com.  Who goes there?  I might be throwing out a first pitch.  In Chicago?  Possibly.  That would be fun.  Oh, Jesus.  Kenny's running.  Yes, Kenny.  I don't know if it's going to happen or not. 
[01:08:30]  You're not.  The game's Friday night.  Oh, man.  Yeah?  We're broadcasting Friday night.  I know that.  I'm aware of the conflict.  I know what time I would leave the broadcast early and go do that.  I've already talked to people.  Wait.  Then you make me and I do more radio.  You guys can stop.  I'm joking.  All right.  I would love to.  Yeah, I know when the game is.  I would love to see a first pitch.  Of course.  Oh, so obviously we have to stop the broadcast so we can see Jimmy throw out the first pitch. 
[01:09:00]  I'd love to see that.  I've never been to a Cubs game.  Is it Cubs or White Sox?  I'd love to see it on video.  I don't know yet.  You better pick the right team.  I want to see it on video.  People are very serious about their baseball teams.  Watch it over and over again.  Well, that's exactly it.  Yeah.  Oh, you'd probably do good and make everyone look stupid.  I don't know about that.  Fire a fastball right across the plate.  You've got to do something crazy.  Do a Bob Bob buoy where it fucking went into like the dugout.  I don't remember.  Who else fucked up that we know?  Chris Rock? 
[01:09:30]  No, Jim Jeffries.  Jim Jeffries.  See?  Yeah.  He had a horrible pitch.  Jim Jeffries.  All right, we'll figure it all out.  Facebook page, Opie and Anthony, one word.  All the info should be up there.  You know they're doing a contest?  Who is?  What?  We are.  Oh, cool.  What's the contest?  Enter for your chance to fly to Chicago and meet Opie and Anthony?  Oh, yeah?  Yeah.  Opie and Anthony, Chicago.  Trip Kidwin.  I think I do remember them saying something about that.  Okay, SiriusXM.com slash Opie and Anthony.  Yeah, we talked about that.  How do they enter it?  What do they have to do to win?  You just have to go to SiriusXM.com slash Opie and Anthony. 
[01:10:00]  It's like a drawing or something.  Oh, okay.  Opie and Anthony.  I kind of remember.  Airfare, too?  Yeah.  No way.  Wow.  Wow.  That's crazy.  Usually they give away stuff, but you have to get your ass there yourself.  That would happen.  What's the center for your chance to fly to Chicago to meet Opie and Anthony so maybe  you win the opportunity to fly and then you pay for it yourself?  You don't need to win the opportunity to fly, though.  You can do that.  I'm sure that they'll take care of airfare.  No, they'll rig the contest and get a local person to save money on the airfare. 
[01:10:30]  Yeah, exactly.  A round-trip coach air transportation for two to Chicago for a major commercial airport.  Two nights' accommodations.  Anchorage.  Yeah.  Two nights and two tickets to the Opie and Anthony event, August 10th, 2012.  All right.  So Facebook page, Opie and Anthony, one word, or go to SiriusXM.com slash Opie and Anthony  for all the details and a chance to win the trip, I guess. 
[01:11:00]  We should have the trip info on our Facebook page as well, right, E-Rock?  I'll put it up there.  Well, you better.  You better.  And hopefully people will come out.  We have no idea.  We're taking a chance with this one.  Yeah, I don't know, man, about you.  We're competing with Comic-Con and we're 40 minutes away from Comic-Con, which is good  because that's where you want to be.  When the big event is in town, you want to be as far away from what's happening as humanly  possible.  Believe me, it's going to be a fun event.  Oof.  I hope people come.  Yeah. 
[01:11:30]  Are we going to the area where people get murdered?  I don't know.  They have a lot of people that have died up there this summer, huh?  Nah, we're not going to that place.  All right, good.  No, but we won't be there long enough for anything to happen anyway.  We'll be out there from Chicago time, 4 o'clock to 4.07 before we peter out and start using  dirty language, you know, because we've got to think about what people are going to think  if we have girls crawl around like pigs.  That might look bad.  That'll look bad for us.  Well, then maybe you should send fucking Hits 1 and not the Opie and Anthony show.  That's kind of what we do.  Yeah. 
[01:12:00]  Do we know what we're doing for the event yet?  No, no idea.  Oh, well, why would we?  It's going to be fun, though.  It's going to be good events.  That'll be hilarious.  That's your decision.  Yeah, he sent out the list of bits.  Got a lot of bits.  And activities to choose from.  Yeah, guys worked hard on this.  Now it's up to us to decide what we want to do.  I was listening, by the way, to Chicago, the police scanner last night.  I went to sleep to it.  The Chicago police scanner.  Why the heck did you do that? 
[01:12:30]  It, I swear to you, from the second I turned it on, it was like an action movie where too  much shit was going on for it to be real.  Like you'd watch a movie and go, no way this can happen.  There's no way this can happen.  There was a car chase going on, helicopters chasing people that ditched out of another  car, a crowd of unrulies outside of McDonald's, shots fired.  It was just bam, bam, bam, bam, one after another. 
[01:13:00]  Unbelievable.  Right before you go to sleep.  Dude, I fell asleep to it.  I woke up, it was still on.  It was on my pillow.  I had my iPad on the other pillow and I just had it turned on because I didn't want to watch  TV.  So I just listened to that and went to sleep to the lullaby noises of fucking undesirables  having a hell of a time in Chicago.  Were we always this different?  Yeah.  No, I need to know.  You changed more than me.  You think? 
[01:13:30]  Yeah.  Because I meditated before I went to bed last night.  Oh, man.  I took a meditation class.  Some people listen to beach sounds.  Yeah.  Waves crashing.  We need some.  You're looking at one.  I have a whole bunch of CDs.  I fall asleep to police scanners.  That's crazy.  No, I fucking slept like a baby.  Does that make you dream about weird shit?  I don't know what happened.  I had a dream.  It was really cold out.  I don't know what happened.  And then I'm like, what happened?  It was just like 90 today in the dream.  I didn't realize I was dreaming.  So no rape. 
[01:14:00]  Sometimes you watch a movie or have a conversation before you go to sleep and somehow that gets  involved in your feelings.  Yeah, I love that.  So you're not in the middle of some crazy action movie?  No, I would love if that did happen.  And sometimes it does.  You know, something, a sound or TV show will kind of leak into your dream.  But no, not this time.  I was bummed.  And you realize you were in a dream and you just start shooting every black person you saw.  Whoa.  Why?  Why would I do that?  Just, I don't know.  It's a dream.  It's a dream.  It's a dream.  You're allowed to do whatever you want in your dream.  I don't want to do that. 
[01:14:30]  That's crazy.  Just fun dreams.  It was fun, though, listening to that.  It was so action-packed.  I was told I had a meditation experience last night.  What was that?  Because I had fluttery eyes.  Do you want to hear this?  I had fluttery eyes because we had to talk about our meditation experiences after the fight.  To who?  To the guru.  How long was the class?  It was an hour and a half.  What time?  I told Jimmy in the bathroom.  It was from 8 to 9.30. 
[01:15:00]  I closed my eyes and it was bright sunlight coming in.  And I opened my eyes and it was pitch dark and I have no idea how long we were doing our thing.  That's crazy.  I swear, I told Jimmy in the bathroom.  I thought it was 15 minutes, but it was like a half hour to four minutes.  And my eyes were fluttering and she said that was really good.  What happens in your head when you're meditating?  I don't know.  Do you see things?  Do you go someplace?  I'm a newbie.  I have no idea.  Do you see globby shit?  Are you cognizant of the fact that you're sitting there? 
[01:15:30]  Sort of.  But then all of a sudden you kind of lose track.  And hence my eyes were fluttering.  And I told her, I think I was just getting ready to fall asleep.  She goes, oh no, that was a meditation experience.  That's really good.  I'm like, oh, cool.  Oh.  Because I don't know what I'm doing.  And then I felt some kind of separation from my body.  No, you didn't.  A slight separation.  That doesn't really.  I hope you didn't leave that beautiful thing far behind.  Mm-hmm.  Like, close your eyes.  You see darkness?  Yeah.  Now, last night, the darkness was, like, over here. 
[01:16:00]  What?  Does that make sense?  What?  Not in the least.  It was sort of 3D-ish.  Like, what I'm showing in is, like, the darkness that you see when you close your eyes, it was separated, and it started about three or four inches away from my face.  So what was right in front of your face?  Ah, like, kind of a vastness.  Oh, I got you.  Oh, my God.  You're freaking out.  All right.  I got you.  So how does that happen?  There's, like, a space between.  But it's not supposed to.  Wait, you see a space now?  And darkness.  Yeah, I can make a space.  Oh, then I was nervous.  He's having a meditation experience.  You're having a meditation experience, eh? 
[01:16:30]  Oh, shit.  Way to go in.  Having a masturbation experience.  I don't see any, any, there's, I see no space.  Just darkness.  That's what I mean, no space.  But when I was in the middle of, like, doing our thing.  Yeah, there's, like, a little fucking stage for things to happen on.  It is, right?  Yeah.  Well, I never noticed that.  I never noticed that before until I was meditating last time.  I'm like, wait, but then what's that space?  I don't know.  Yeah, I don't know either.  That's where the meditation experience takes place.  Where's the, I don't see any space.  I just see a fucking dark, my eyes are closed. 
[01:17:00]  I see lids.  I see eyelashes.  Yeah, exactly.  I don't know.  But you don't have any, like, daydreams or visions or nothing?  All I know is I was relaxed and I went to sleep for once.  Oh, it makes you go to sleep easier?  No, I mean, my, uh, did I have thought?  I didn't have thought.  It was globby shit.  Globby.  Like a lava lamp?  Weird.  Yeah, bluish.  Like a lava lamp?  Bluish and purple.  But a free lava lamp.  Yeah.  Whoa.  That's pretty sweet.  And fluttery eyes.  A free lava lamp. 
[01:17:30]  Cool.  It's some kind of energy that's coming up, I guess.  I don't know.  I don't know.  You got energy coming up?  I don't know what I'm doing.  Is positivity flowing?  Yeah.  Nice.  I had no bad thoughts.  Oh.  I don't know what I was doing.  I'm not going to lie to you.  I have no idea.  And my back.  Meditation's hard, man.  And my back hurt because we were sitting on the floor.  And you thought you were there for like 15 minutes, but it was 45?  It was, I, it was 30, I think she said.  That's crazy.  But I thought it was about 10.  She probably lied.  She probably just speeds up the clocks.  Closes the shades.  It was pitch dark. 
[01:18:00]  I'm like, what the fuck?  Somewhere along the way, I lost track of time.  That's definite.  Weird.  Yeah.  Lost track of time?  And you're going to sleep with fucking.  Police scanners.  Police scanners going on.  That, I would not be able to sleep after that.  It was pretty fucking cool.  It was like going to sleep to an action movie.  How long could you meditate for, do you think?  Like three seconds.  Yeah.  And then I gotta, ah, I gotta get up.  You need to do some ohms and mantras and breathing.  I am not doing any ohms. 
[01:18:30]  I could not do an ohm.  Jimmy was doing an ohm.  Ohm.  You have mantras?  Oh yeah.  I got a mantra.  Making the lights down?  Get me out of here.  Get me out of here.  That's a mantra.  A daily mantra.  But you have to just do it that way.  Ah.  That makes everything spiritual.  We, we, we, we.  I have a mantra.  We, we, we.  We, we.  Scrooge.  Scrooge.  Scrooge. 
[01:19:00]  That would actually work, you know.  Yeah, it would.  Because I guess that shit is supposed to like.  Yeah.  Clean out your mind a little bit.  Yeah.  Get all that other shit and thoughts out of your brain.  So you can get to this place where.  Yeah.  I don't know.  The rhythm of the universe or something.  You sit Indian style on the floor and do it?  Oh yeah.  Whoa.  Yeah, your back aches a bit.  Is that it, really?  Are you supposed to, like, relax?  Oh, my back hurts.  Well, that's why you do yoga.  I didn't know that.  Kettlebelled yesterday.  The whole reason to do yoga, supposedly, is so you can meditate. 
[01:19:30]  This is awesome.  It's doing kettlebell workouts and listening to police scanners.  And Ope's doing yoga and meditating.  I'm like an animal.  I have no downtime.  I didn't know that, though.  Well, supposedly, yoga is to get the body so you can sit properly to meditate.  That's all it is.  Even though it turns out to be a good workout.  That's crazy.  But that's the real reason, I think.  Wow.  Wow, yoga people are going to probably fucking kill me today because I don't know shit.  You're a newbie. 
[01:20:00]  How long have you been meditating for?  I just ended my whole meditation class.  I did a four-week program.  But that's like first grade?  Holy shit.  And then I did just a regular class last night.  I'm going to do that every week, I think.  But you're supposed to meditate every day for ten minutes.  Do you?  Not really.  Here or there, though.  Are you finding inner peace with it?  Are you finding some inner peace?  Oh, yeah.  Yeah?  Oh, yeah.  You got to keep up the practice, though.  I took drums in sixth grade.  I never practiced. 
[01:20:30]  That was terrible.  It is about practicing.  You can't just do one class and go, all right, I'll be back in a week.  Right.  Oh, yeah.  That's why I don't give a fuck about this silliness with this silly place anymore.  You could be a yogi.  No.  If this doesn't work out, who cares?  Be a yogi.  Celebrity yogi, Opie Hughes.  Oh, boy, will they be disappointed.  A celebrity yogi?  I don't want to be a yogi.  I don't know.  I liked it. 
[01:21:00]  I liked it.  You want a break?  I want to meditate.  I don't want a break.  I know, right?  Let's just own.  As a goof, we should do a meditation thing.  Would someone do that for us?  Is that really personal shit for people?  What?  They come in and do the whole, and now, do they talk like that?  No, it's not personal.  Really soft.  Oh, God.  And the mantras are probably personal.  Oh, God.  What is that about?  And we all get our, whoa. 
[01:21:30]  Here's what I was hearing.  One more.  One more.  Push it.  Push it.  Push it up.  I'm like, ah, this sucks.  I do that shit, too, though.  Yeah?  Yeah.  You're like, work out over, time to relax, lay down, put on the Chicago police scanner.  Chicago police scanner.  Tweet maniacally about George Zimmerman.  About George Zimmerman and racism.  Ant's whole life is adrenaline.  It really is.  It's an adrenaline rush.  Holy fuck.  When do you relax?  When the fuck do you relax?  You don't have to meditate, but do you ever just go, ah.  Even when I'm sleeping, I'm listening to police scanners. 
[01:22:00]  Yeah, because you have to keep your TV on or something, so do you just sit by your pool  ever, turn off the music, and just, like, relax?  No, the music's on all the time, like, I got, like, lithium on.  I know, your music's on all the time, your TVs are on all the time, police scanners.  But I'm also tweeting, I'm also tweeting my arguments when I'm sitting by the pool.  Like, I'm sitting by the pool, I got a beer and stuff, and I'm just kind of like,  ah, you son of a bitch!  Ah, and then I gotta go in the water.  I started phone downtime, too.  What?  Yeah.  Why?  Starting to leave the house old school.  That's the shit. 
[01:22:30]  Starting to leave the house old school.  Is that, like, the new thing to do?  I'm telling you.  Yeah.  I did it when I was in Bermuda.  It was awesome.  What if I leave one of my phones at home?  No.  Is that okay?  No?  Well, how long did you go?  Three or four days.  I don't know.  I could go maybe a couple hours.  Yeah.  But that's good enough for me.  Like, phone downtime, you gotta.  You start realizing, I'm just wasting way too much fucking time on my phone.  You're not missing anything.  Yeah.  So I'm starting to leave the house without the phone a little bit.  Although we also...  A little bit, and it's weird, too, because you're like, fuck.  Because the thing is, like, if I see something cool, I want to, you know, video it off my 
[01:23:00]  phone or take a picture.  So I'm taking a little risk that I might come up with something.  Why don't you just pop it in airplane mode?  But then you...  Just pop it in airplane mode.  You still got it.  No, you still have it.  But then you're going to be tempted.  And you got a picture.  But you're going to be tempted.  But you can still take pictures.  You know what?  I'm going to go airplane mode.  Go airplane mode.  No, don't go airplane mode.  I'm going to try.  Experience life.  Stop taking pictures of everything and just live it.  What if you need it?  What if all of a sudden something's happening, and you're like, great, I don't have a fucking  phone.  You have a memory.  God blessed us with long-term memory. 
[01:23:30]  I don't mean that.  I mean, like, an emergency where you've got to dial 911 or something.  That is onto something.  I'm going to do airplane mode.  Go airplane mode.  I want to see how long I can do airplane mode while I'm walking around New York City.  And then I still have...  Take a flight or something, too?  But then I'll still have my video on my fucking camera.  Step in the wrong direction.  Double miles.  Yeah.  Fuck yeah.  Double seats.  You fucking just nailed it.  In airplane mode, I still got my phone to do videos.  No.  Don't do videos.  What if a homeless guy's taking a shit, and I don't have my... 
[01:24:00]  Live it.  Experience it.  Exactly.  Go grab it.  Smell it.  Wrap it around your cock.  Punch, but don't taste.  But if you don't take video of it, then it didn't really happen.  Yes, it did.  You don't have to share it.  It could be your life.  You don't have to share it.  That's how I live.  Isn't it weird how this was all totally normal 10 years ago?  Like, just going out with no phone or...  Yeah, we talk about it all the time.  Yeah.  But I think we all have to go back to that a little bit.  A little bit.  Because we're wasting so much time on our phones.  If you really think about it, Twitter's completely useless. 
[01:24:30]  It's nonsense.  But it's complete information access.  Like, it's hard...  But half the time, you're reading stuff that doesn't even matter.  Right.  Every once in a while, you find something cool.  Yeah, I mean, for a while it was TV, and then it was this.  There's always something to take us out of.  Eventually, this will be normal, and we won't have computers with us or phones.  It'll all just be...  They say you'll always have your hard drive with you.  There won't be, like, these computers.  It'll always be with you, and you'll be able to bring it up anywhere.  Well, that's where the cloud shit comes in. 
[01:25:00]  And it's worse if you're OCD.  If I know that I'm not going to be able to check Twitter for, like, an hour or so,  I'll load up my tweets.  And then, like, last night, I sat on my couch, catching up on 400 tweets.  Because I have to read everything.  Oh, sorry.  You read your entire timeline?  I just have to.  I never do.  What's the point of following these people?  Oh, I do, too.  If I'm not...  You could have stopped there.  What's the point of following these people?  Well, you should follow, because you don't have to hear everything they say.  But I know I don't, but in my head, you know, like, I need to read everything that happened. 
[01:25:30]  Even if it's pointless.  Like, out of those 400 tweets, maybe two of them mattered.  You know what happens?  We're not looking at our phones for news and tweets and stuff that are important or something.  Most of the time, you're refreshing, waiting for something to happen.  You're waiting for a new tweet.  You're waiting for some news.  You just go around the apps that you normally have, keep refreshing and hoping something pops up.  That's the biggest waste of fucking time ever.  But it's what most people do. 
[01:26:00]  You're not on there constantly going, damn, I needed to see that.  Holy shit, look at the news.  Wow, this person's interesting.  It's usually...  I go, oh, cool, Seinfeld reference.  Oh, look.  Yeah.  Look at that.  It says Seinfeld reference.  And that's a funny one.  I got it.  L-O-M-L.  You can do the exact same thing with your social media, whatever you're using out there.  Yeah.  I just check in every hour, even.  Yeah, but what if I miss that?  None of us do that.  Then you check that hour, and then what happens the second...  But you could...  Now you're an hour behind. 
[01:26:30]  Yeah, what if I miss something?  Yeah.  That's how I think.  Not really.  What if I want to have a witty tweet about something?  That's right.  Oh, my God.  Chip-a.  Chip-a.  We're going to have some chip audio after the break.  Chip is fucking sick.  From Comic-Con.  And we're also going to do some Louis...  It's audio day, to be honest with you, because we got Louis C.K. on The Daily Show.  I want to hear this.  He's got a nice take on Daniel Tosh, which I guess is still happening.  I bet he said he should have apologized.  It's terrible.  And I don't consider him a comedian. 
[01:27:00]  Yes.  You nailed it.  Colin said, that's why I keep it PG.  Really?  That's why I keep it PG.  Colin does not break character on that fucking Twitter.  And see, that's why I need to read Twitter, because I don't want to miss any Colin Quinn tweets.  Anything important that happens on Twitter is just on every website anyway.  Right.  But I don't go to other websites.  Well, I go to one other website.  But I don't leave Twitter.  I'm like, Twitter gives me the headline, and then I go, oh, okay, now I can read the story. 
[01:27:30]  I don't really read my timeline at all anymore.  You don't?  No.  I don't care.  You're not going to like this tweet.  Uh-oh.  What's the matter?  They thanked me for letting Ant turn the show into conservative radio.  How about you get someone who could actually debate him?  One-sided rants.  Ugh, shut up.  Shut the fuck up.  Or a neck I call up and debate.  Yeah, I'd debate Ant when I don't agree with him.  I had.  When I agree with him, I don't.  Yeah, we don't just sit here fucking...  That's how people fucking hear shit. 
[01:28:00]  Shut the fuck up!  If you don't agree, call the fucking show.  You fucking retard brain!  And now this.  It's on.  Sirius XM.  This is the OPNN3 Show.  Lots going on today.  I want to acknowledge John Lord, Anthony. 
[01:28:30]  Yes.  Did you know his name?  Oh, yeah.  You did?  Yep.  I did not know his name.  I was a big fan of the Deep Purple.  Yeah, Deep Purple.  The Deep Purple.  John Lord basically gave him that sound.  Yeah.  The keyboardist.  Yep.  He's a ditch.  At the age of 71.  Got some Deep Purple for everyone there, E-Rock.  Let's see what he pulls out.  Is he going to go deep?  Purple.  Is he going to go purple?  I only know one song, man. 
[01:29:00]  You play Smoke on the Water, I'll bite your fingers.  That's the only one I know, too, though.  Okay.  Then never mind.  Oh, no.  You got to go with knocking on your back door, man.  I like that one.  Or Perfect Strangers.  That's a good one, too.  Perfect Strangers.  Of course, one of their earlier hits, a hush.  Hush.  Yeah.  Was that their first hit?  I think it was.  Was that before Smoke?  Yeah.  No kidding.  Yeah.  I think you know more about Deep Purple than me.  A little bit.  You were into them?  I was into Deep Purple, yeah. 
[01:29:30]  I like them.  They were rocking.  Oh, God.  Let's go.  Turn, turn, turn, turn, turn, turn.  This is one of those songs.  When you hear this on the radio, you're all in.  This kicks in really nice.  Who the fuck turns to something else when this is on?  Yeah.  It's over seven minutes.  So, John Lord's dead.  This is our tribute.  Yeah, motherfucker.  Let's do it.  You want to do it?  Oh, it's great.  This is our tribute to John Lord.  Yeah, motherfucker. 
[01:30:00]  Metallica stole that right there.  Oh, yeah.  This rocks.  What's the matter, Jimmy?  That's okay.  Sweet Lucy was a dancer.  That's how the vocals kick in.  Sweet Lucy was a dancer.  But no one was a dancer.  Because she was a samurai. 
[01:30:30]  Great, right?  No, but it is good.  You don't like this?  I like it.  I don't think it's great, but I like it.  I like it.  She came on like a teaser.  I had some pleasure.  Yeah.  Enjoy a little paradise.  The love was in my pocket and we're losing everybody.  Yeah, put on a highway star.  Yeah?  Yeah.  Highway star?  Yeah.  That's some highway star.  This is child of the 80s shit, Sam.  Yeah.  Holy fuck. 
[01:31:00]  He rocked.  Throwing highway star.  You like highway star?  Yeah.  With that voice?  This is a good one.  That voice gets high in this song.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Can you pull this off?  Or back in the day?  It's tough.  It's a tough one, right?  I actually have better range now than I did back in the day.  How's that?  I don't know, but I do.  It's amazing.  I don't know how.  I think because I just use my voice more than I used to.  And you don't smoke.  And I don't smoke.  And I fucking...  You're practicing your voice.  I don't blow my voice out on a weekendly basis. 
[01:31:30]  I don't know how to do this.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Is that his actual voice?  No fooling around in the studio?  It has to, right?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  This reminds me of Trash, the song he did with Sabbath after.  Yeah.  This was first, though, yeah.  Right. 
[01:32:00]  What year is this, 74?  76?  Oh, yeah.  Why would you fade it out at the fucking Hawk?  The song's called Highway Star.  Oh.  And he lowers the volume.  Then he turns it back up for the verse.  Highway Star.  What was the last song they did before they started going bye-bye? 
[01:32:30]  As far as, like, mainstream shit goes.  I think that was, like, yeah, Awful Perfect Strangers, right?  You think that was it for them?  I think that was it.  That's a hell of a way to go out.  Yeah.  That was a good one.  Perfect Strangers are knocking on my back door.  The drummer's really good, too, for Deep Purple.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  It turns me on.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  I'm the one-way star. 
[01:33:00]  What year is this, Samuel?  It's got to be the 70s.  Well, 70s.  Look, you can't even find it.  I'm going to go late 70s.  I'm going to go 78.  I said 74.  Travis found two news articles.  78.  I have the information.  Oh, Anthony.  What is it?  1972.  72.  Highway Star 72?  Yeah.  Wow, that's a roll.  Nah.  Yeah.  Child of the 80s shit. 
[01:33:30]  Ah.  Hey, man.  It's on the home of rock and roll.  Whatever they were playing when I was a child of the 80s.  Oh, I see.  I was all in.  Yeah.  Here we go.  John Boyle's right there.  Keyboard solo.  Then it blends nice into the guitar.  Yeah.  Some good shit.  The kids today don't know how to play their instruments in.  Nope. 
[01:34:00]  And Deep Purple was a record holder for the loudest band at a live performance.  They were louder than any other band.  Not the SFPs.  I guess.  Much louder than them.  Oh.  Like 2,000 decibels.  We can fade this out.  Yeah.  That's good.  What were some of the other songs they did?  Some of the other songs Deep Purple had.  Did we nail them all?  Highway Star.  Hush.  You go with the smoke. 
[01:34:30]  You go with the Perfect Strangers knocking on my back door.  Are we missing any?  That's all.  Kentucky Woman is...  That was the Neil Diamond cover, right?  Hush.  You see anything else there?  Really fast.  And then we can move on.  What am I?  I don't know any of those.  I mean, I kind of know, but not...  They weren't like hits.  What else?  This is like the single CD.  That was, huh?  Yeah.  Yeah, no, that was about it then.  Go up side two.  Let me see.  Let me see.  Let me see. 
[01:35:00]  We're side two.  Yeah, motherfucker.  Black Knight.  See, I don't know.  Do you know like some deep tracks on these guys, sort of?  But, uh, it's been so fucking long since I've even listened to these motherfuckers.  Yeah.  Richie Blackboa.  Ian Gillum was in Jesus Christ Superstar.  Really?  Yeah.  He was fucking...  That great, powerful voice. 
[01:35:30]  Was he the main guy?  No.  Well, he was either Jesus or Judas.  One of the two.  But, I mean, I meant, I guess, the main guy when that Broadway show was at its peak.  Yeah, yeah, it was during the actual cast that put out the album, when the album first  came out.  Wow, you know a lot about, uh, Bright Purple and these guys.  Motherfuckal.  Shit, motherfucker.  Let's move on to Chip at Comic-Con.  Chip, uh...  Where we at?  Well, uh, should we go back to where we were from day one when he was... 
[01:36:00]  Yeah, we're going day one, I guess, right?  Yeah.  Well, Chip, you know, accompanied me to Comic-Con, and he was interviewing a lot of the people  that were there, a lot of people dressed up in outfits.  Yes.  Uh, making observations.  I avoided that word.  I saw you did that, but I wouldn't avoid saying...  Costumes.  ...in order to remind everybody that you don't know how to speak properly.  I speak very well.  Hold on, we've got to go backwards for a second.  Oh, shit, wow.  It was driving me nuts, because I knew there was one more in there.  Space Dragon.  Thank you.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. 
[01:36:30]  Thank you, Kevin from Connecticut, of course.  Kevin from Con with two Ns, if you want to follow him on Twitter.  Mr. No Life Kevin from Connecticut, who's always here to chime in.  Mm-hmm.  Yeah, what's he, got no wife or something?  No.  That's what I said.  Fuck off, he says.  He just writes, fuck off.  A good fuck off is hilarious.  I'd rather fuck Raid.  Oh, no, a bug spray joke.  Good one, Chip.  Fucking A. 
[01:37:00]  Double roaches.  Oh.  I thought it was...  No.  No.  It works fine.  No, it really doesn't.  So, Chip was at Comical Con.  Comical Con.  And he's interviewing a guy in a bumblebee suit.  You know, a lot of people get this confused.  I believe Chip is incorrect.  I believe it is actually Comic Con, short for Comic Convention.  Uh-huh.  I don't think Comical Con is correct.  Well, when he's there, it is.  Chip, though.  Do you make it into one word, or is it Comic Con, or you go Comic Con?  You go Comic Con. 
[01:37:30]  Comic Con?  No, you say Comic Con.  No, it's not Comic Con.  You don't go Comic Con.  I know it's Comic Con, but everyone says Comic Con.  Everyone just says Comic Con.  Then you start drifting in.  Like, my dad started saying Comi-Con, and I was like, no, dad.  That's not it.  That explains the mustache.  Oh, shit.  I say Comic Book Convention.  No, you don't.  You say Comical Con.  It's like an idiot.  No one says Comic Con.  It's Comic Con.  No, they say Comic Con.  Officially, it's Comic Con.  They just say, you're going to Comic Con?  Yeah, they go Comic Con.  You're going to Comic Con?  Comic Con.  Comic Con.  Comic Con.  It's hard to do double consonants. 
[01:38:00]  Comic Con.  Yes.  Comic Con.  There you go.  Comic Con.  Comic Con.  That's your new mantra.  Comic.  Comic Con.  Con!  Yes!  Wow.  Hillary looks like Paul Williams in the 70s.  What the fuck?  God, what the fuck is that?  A big egghead hair do.  She's decided to grow her hair long.  You know what she loves, Sean.  That's what she looks like.  She looks awful.  Coming down in three-part harmony.  She's trying to soften her look for the ladies.  Soften her look for the ladies.  She's a doik. 
[01:38:30]  Well, there are rumors.  I think she's softening her look for the ladies.  She wants to be the soft one.  She's going lipstick lesbian.  Comic Con.  A Comic Con?  Comic Con.  Comic Con.  Pictures in our bodies.  Sounds terrible.  When is the big Comic Con special on this channel?  The Comic Con special will be on...  That's where you're interviewing big celebrities like Anthony Bourdain and...  Rob Zombie.  Rob Zombie.  CM Hasselhoff.  CM Punk.  Lucy Liu. 
[01:39:00]  I'm Anthony Bourdum.  Because I'm boring.  You're not boring.  I'm sleepy.  You're so excited.  Your name should be Party Funtime.  I don't know.  I couldn't think of it.  That's a good start.  That is a good start.  Here's Chip at Comic Con.  And he's interviewing a guy in a Bumblebee suit.  Excuse me, Mr. Bumblebee.  We're talking to people for Chip at TV on the YouTube.  Would you talk to us?  We're interviewing people in costumes.  I'm not Mr. Bumblebee.  Oh, I'm sorry.  What's your name?  Come here close.  You're going to knock everybody over. 
[01:39:30]  They're going to get paralyzed.  Stupid.  What's your name?  I'm Henchman21 from the Venture Brothers.  What's Henchman21?  I'm the Monarchs Henchman.  What does that do?  I don't know anything about that.  Oh, you know what Henchmen are, right?  I don't know what Henchmen are.  I don't know the Minions that the Monarch, he's like our big boss leader.  The Millions are what?  What?  The Millions, you said?  I'm sorry.  They're Minions.  Minions.  Do you sting people?  Yes.  And yes. 
[01:40:00]  What's your superpowers?  Nothing.  I just have a high tolerance for pain, so I get beat up a lot.  I did too.  When I was a kid, my mother's friends would always hit me.  She'd say, Chipper, stop talking in there.  Me too.  Are you a good guy or a bad guy?  Bad guy.  Bad guy?  Yeah.  What do you do at Comical Cons?  What?  What do you do when you're here?  I cosplay.  I go to panels.  I watch movies.  I'm just relaxing. 
[01:40:30]  Me too.  Are you supposed to wear your mask?  Yeah, but I can't see, though.  How come they don't put eye holes in it?  That don't make no sense.  Oh, that's cool.  I'd be fucking stinging people all day if I had that outfit.  Well, I've been, like, checking people with my wings left and right all day.  Fuck yeah.  Knock him over.  Oh, Jesus.  Yeah.  I've seen this guy in a fucking wheelchair before I want to tip him over.  Oh, that's...  Really?  Fuck him.  Well, someone probably does. 
[01:41:00]  He's Chip now.  All right.  Well, thanks talking to you.  Thank you very much.  Wow.  It's so uncomfortable.  Of course it is.  The guy, you can tell he didn't even want to be there after, like, the first couple of  questions.  He realizes this is not good.  And he figures he'll match Chip with some humor.  And then Chip is just straight-faced and talking about tipping people over in wheelchairs.  Do these guys look like complete idiots dressed up as bumblebees?  Yes.  Yeah, he looks like a big bee. 
[01:41:30]  He was a big fat guy that we saw.  Does anyone take them seriously?  Or is everyone else like, holy fuck, there's a bunch of idiots here.  They're all idiots.  So it's like, who's going to call them idiots if they are the idiots?  But are there, like, quote, normal people there that go, holy fuck, look at all these  idiots?  Not really.  Not really, huh?  Everyone's all in.  Normal people are there, but they're like, oh, man, look at these guys.  Everybody's having so much fun.  They're idiots.  Such a weird culture.  Fucking idiots.  I don't understand it at all.  Fucking, fucking idiots.  Why would he go there dressed as a bumblebee? 
[01:42:00]  I guess that's his favorite character.  Everybody loves cosplaying there.  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Cosplaying is so big.  What's that mean?  It's you dressing up in outfits.  Cosplaying.  Cosplaying.  So they all act like Bill Cosby.  Yeah, exactly.  That's good.  Do general putting jokes.  Cosplaying.  I guess because they're playing in costume.  Oh, cosplay.  Cosplay.  Why not char playing?  It's a character.  That's way better.  That is way better.  Cos.  Anthony, we've got to go backwards again.  No. 
[01:42:30]  We missed another song.  Damn it.  Which one?  We missed another song.  Which one?  Woman from Tokyo.  Oh, that was a good one.  Coming in by too many people.  Oh, yeah.  I'll give Soundboard Fez this one.  One.  Woman from Tokyo.  That's a great song.  My woman from Tokyo.  Tokyo.  I loved how they said Tokyo.  Tokyo.  She makes me see.  My woman from Tokyo.  Oh, yeah.  I know that one.  Yo.  She's so good to me.  Boom.  Can we hear a little My Woman from Tokyo?  Yeah.  Come on.  The iconic fucking hi-hat. 
[01:43:00]  Oh, wow.  Yeah.  This is a hit too.  Yeah.  I think so.  Oh, man.  Any of these came on the radio.  You just fucking crank that bitch up.  Get ready to start singing.  You put your fucking...  You put your right hand at noon on that steering wheel.  Right hand at fucking noon.  That left arm is out your window.  Now you're fucking styling.  Oh, wait.  Let me open the fly window to get the air on me. 
[01:43:30]  Fly window.  Child of the 80s.  Yeah.  Now...  Just gas it.  Yeah, motherfucker.  Ha!  Ha!  Then you crash.  Terrible.  Paralyzed.  I miss...  I miss songs building.  Yeah, the build.  You don't get this anymore.  I don't have to sing right away.  Oh, no.  Flying to the rising sun.  Faces are smiling at everyone.  Yeah.  I get that.  Yeah. 
[01:44:00]  I get that.  Yeah.  I get that.  Yeah.  I get that.  Yeah.  I get that.  Yeah.  I get the whole new tradition.  Ow!  I get it in my heart.  Woo!  Now I get that loud scream.  Okay, yo.  Okay, yo.  They throw a nice guitar lick in somewhere in the song.  Screaming.  That sounds so good.  If you sang that properly, the song wouldn't make sense.  No.  Woman from Tokyo.  To-kay-o.  He knew how to say to-kay-yo.  To-kay-o. 
[01:44:30]  I don't know.  I think we're done with Deep Purple.  That's like Witch-A-Woman.  I think we've got them all now.  Witch-A-Woman.  Witch-A-Woman.  Oh, Witch-A-Woman.  Is there any other ones now?  Well, I think we've got a bit.  Yeah.  What other words were twisted to fit into songs?  Oh, man.  And we've got Chip Audio, so we're doing two things at one time.  We're multitasking.  Almost a shoehorn.  Chip at Comical Con talks to Judy, but gets very, very distracted.  I don't know who this Chipper is.  I don't enjoy talking to him because I don't understand him. 
[01:45:00]  Judy.  We're Chipper TV on the YouTubes.  What's your name?  Judy.  Hi, Judy.  And why are you all purple?  Why wouldn't I?  Why are you all gray?  I forgot to pack my trunk.  I'll pause real quick.  I'll run, Chip.  Again.  Oh, that's...  This lady is how old is she?  Like, close to 60?  Oh, wow.  And I was wearing the elephant hat.  Like, the little elephant's trunk.  That's why.  Oh, yeah.  Okay.  I forgot to pack your trunk. 
[01:45:30]  Okay.  Because you had an elephant trunk.  Yeah, it's great.  Fucking home run, Chipperson.  I didn't get it.  Oh, because I got an elephant trunk.  Oh, I get it.  My mother would tug it and go, Chip, but that's like your Peter.  Be careful.  Where are you from?  I live in France.  Oh.  What brings you here from France?  Oh, my God.  Look at that guy's bulge.  That's the biggest pecker I've ever seen.  Ha, ha, ha. 
[01:46:00]  She walked away angrily.  I couldn't hold the character.  She said, oh, my God.  She's an old lady.  Can I hear that?  I got to hear her say, oh, my God.  Jim Noren's losing air laugh is one of my favorite things.  That's hilarious.  It doesn't happen often.  Oh, my God.  But when you lose air, oh, God, that's the best laugh ever.  I don't know where it is.  We'll just play from here.  Run, Chipperson.  I don't get it. 
[01:46:30]  Oh, because I got an elephant trunk.  Oh, I get it.  My mother would tug it and go, Chip, but that's like your Peter.  Be careful.  Where are you from?  I live in France.  Oh.  What brings you here from France?  Oh, my God.  Look at that guy's bulge.  That's the biggest pecker I've ever seen.  Uh-oh.  That's like the smoker laugh, guys.  I love that laugh. 
[01:47:00]  I love that.  That's my favorite laugh.  When Jimmy does it and those guys, that losing air laugh gets me every time. 
[01:47:30]  Oh, she was not happy with you.  She had to leave, huh?  She came back.  Do we have a follow-up clip?  Why would we?  We have a friend of the second.  No, we don't.  We absolutely do.  No, we don't.  I don't see it here.  It's the next track on the desk.  Oh, Judy tries to talk to Chip?  That's right.  Oh, I thought it was another Judy.  No, it's the same Judy.  Oh, oh, oh.  Yeah, no.  No, I'm just saying.  If it'd be very good.  Yeah, what happened?  She came back?  Yeah, well, we were trying to film our next piece.  Oh.  And Judy walked up to us and Chip said, hold on, hold on.  Let us turn the camera on.  I made sure we got on the audio.  Yeah, yeah. 
[01:48:00]  Do you have video of Jimmy pointing out this guy's big pecker?  Oh, yes, I do.  I can't wait to see the video of this stuff.  Yeah, it's going to be good.  Not ready yet.  No, because I've got to finish the UNC, as Jim Colnick, expo, probably today.  All right.  And then work on the Comic Con stuff.  Yeah.  Well, no, I'm just saying.  If it'd be very nice, if you're going to talk to women, would you talk respect for them?  I normally would, but I couldn't believe the size of that thing.  There we go.  I couldn't believe it was so big.  I know, but he shouldn't walk out like that. 
[01:48:30]  You shouldn't even have one.  I do.  My mother said it's bigger than average.  I don't even have one.  Oh, what happened?  Why is that?  She comes over and fuck it.  She left the guy.  She walked away.  She just came and scalded me.  I made sure we got the audio.  And you fucking, she comes and scalded me, and you fucked her again.  And you can hear her.  She goes, oh, there we go. 
[01:49:00]  As if, like, oh, here he goes again.  She tried to get you with saying you didn't have a dick.  And then, because she's being dirty, and then you turned it right around, and she had  to leave.  My mother says it was bigger than average.  Oh, is that funny?  Jay from Huntington on Twitter, Jimmy has the same laugh as Muttley.  Ah.  That's good.  Muttley.  Normally I would, but his pecker was so big.  His pecker was so big.  Long Shot Ranch on Twitter.  Jim Norton, you talking to Judy about the bulge is the best laugh I've had in years. 
[01:49:30]  Wow.  Hilarious.  Tears in my eyes.  That's really funny.  Really funny.  Stupid Judy.  Chip talks to a woman in blue paint.  Avatar?  No, this was the abominable snowman's daughter.  What?  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  Sometimes they go deep with their outfits.  Yeah.  Oh.  Okay.  Sounds like shit.  Hello.  Can we talk to you for Chipper TV for YouTube?  That's an amazing outfit, costume.  Where are you from?  What's your name? 
[01:50:00]  My name is Carol.  I'm from Alexandria, Virginia.  Oh, welcome aboard.  I'm Chipper.  And what are you supposed to be?  It looks like you got so cold or something, you turned blue.  It is like that.  I am a character from Monster High, Abby Abominable, the daughter of the abominable snowman.  I didn't know he had a daughter.  It turns out he did.  Just like Dracula had a daughter, and Wolfman had a daughter, and Frankenstein had a daughter.  So what does your character do?  Are you very scary?  It looks like it must be very cold.  How do you eat hot soup?  I have a special necklace that keeps me cold. 
[01:50:30]  The necklace keeps you cold no matter where you go?  Crystal necklace keeps me cold.  Doesn't that make your neck so cold that when somebody kisses it tenderly, their lips get all cold?  Go ahead.  Highly likely, but I'm in high school, so we don't kiss in high school.  Oh.  Are you really in high school, or is that just a character?  The character is in high school.  They're Monster High.  So it's a high school full of the characters.  I dated somebody in high school when I was 25, and my mother said, Chipper, you're going to go to jail if you keep doing that.  She was a freshman.  Yes, that's kind of an age difference. 
[01:51:00]  Yeah, but I didn't care, though.  We laughed a lot together.  She thought my jokes were hilarious.  Like, I forgot to pack my trunk.  Oh, God.  Everybody's cracking up at that one.  I told you that one's good.  Do you have, like, a weapon or something as the space lady in blue?  No, I have a weapon.  Your name is the space lady in blue, right?  Abby Vulnerable.  What's that?  Agatha Bomb in the bowl?  He's not listening.  When I was a kid, I used to throw doo-doo on a stick at people.  I would pick it up on a stick and throw it at people.  Remember, I would say, Chipper, you're going to get it all over their shirts. 
[01:51:30]  That's kind of stinky.  Oh, God.  Are you here?  You're probably not with a boyfriend or nothing, right?  I left my boyfriend at home.  Oh, that's good.  So you could probably hook up with guys.  Probably not.  Oh, no.  Why not?  He won't say nothing.  Because I love him very much.  Whatever.  Did you nice talking to me?  I got to go. 
[01:52:00]  That's my favorite one.  Chip is just on a roll.  Just action, action, action.  Talk, talk, talk, talk, talk.  And then the minute she goes, no, I love him very much.  It's just silence.  Silence with a dumb face, right?  That's exactly right.  That was really funny.  I can't wait to see the video.  He just stares off into the distance.  Well, this is what we'll do.  We got day two of Chip at Comical Khan.  That was still day one?  That was all day one. 
[01:52:30]  A little later in the show, we'll do more.  How's that?  Oh, what a tease.  And then after the break, we'll do Louis C.K. on The Daily Show.  Oh, I want to hear that.  Yeah, sticking up for Daniel Tosh.  And if you want, there's one more Deep Purple song.  There is?  Well.  Smoke on the, in the water.  Smoking water.  Chip, smoking water.  You missed the famous Eddie Trunk interview that me and Jay Moore did for his book, You  Were Out That Day.  Uh-huh.  And Eddie Trunk meant well, and he has a book, and he picks, like, bands and then has the 
[01:53:00]  top five songs from each band, and he leaves out key songs in every band.  Oh, right.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  It drove me and Jay nuts that day.  It was a pretty good listen.  But for Deep Purple, he puts his, one of the top five most influential metal songs, Child  in Time.  Jimmy?  I don't know that song.  Child in Time.  Sounds like a kid in a watch.  Go to break.  No, no, no.  I just want to break on a big laugh.  Although that was good. 
[01:53:30]  Although that was good, that was, we've got to do a little something.  Chip, you do not steer the ship.  Go to break.  Eddie Trunk's book was filled with a lot of these top five lists.  Yeah.  And it drove us nuts that day.  And most influential, influential metal songs.  Do you have a list, Jimmy?  Songs that were very influential?  Jesus.  I'd not, because my list would be so biased.  I mean, I recognize that Stairway to Heaven's a great song. 
[01:54:00]  Again, Smoke on the Water, but I wouldn't put metal, though.  Yeah.  I mean, there's a leap.  I'd put fucking Run to the Hills.  Yeah.  You got another thing coming by Priest.  They were big songs.  What makes it influential?  Holy fuck.  I think the ones that kind of crossed into, the ones that got a tremendous amount of play  on MTV had a big thing in pushing the genre of metal.  Yeah.  Other guys.  But I mean, you wouldn't consider Deep Purple a metal band.  No, but I guess they're kind of classified as really hard rock.  Right.  But my list wouldn't be accurate, because, again, I'm so fucking rock and roll all night 
[01:54:30]  by Kiss.  That's more hard rock than metal.  Right.  Can I hear Child in Time?  I don't even know this song.  I don't know this one.  Eddie Trunk loves this one.  Oh, boy.  There's the keyboard again.  Yeah.  Very sad.  Ten and a half minutes.  We lost John.  Ten and a half minutes.  What else are we doing?  Oh, my God.  Can Deep Purple not do a three and a half minute song?  You didn't have to back then, Sam. 
[01:55:00]  People chilled.  They didn't have phones.  People knew how to relax.  Hung out in the fucking, in the attic playing this shit, smoking pot.  Yeah.  This is cool as shit.  I don't know if I've ever heard this.  You remember this?  This is so self-indulgent.  Yeah.  It really is.  John Lord.  He was in Hawaii Five-O.  That was Jack Lord.  Was there a big wave hitting you or something? 
[01:55:30]  That was Jack Lord.  Shut up.  You'll see the light.  Eddie Trunk's an ass.  It's a good tune, bud.  Come on, Eddie.  Is it one of those story songs?  Yeah.  See the blind man shooting at the world.  Who does he sound like?  He's trying to be nuts.  Oh. 
[01:56:00]  Barry Manilow?  Taking toll.  Oh, yeah.  Okay.  If you've been bad, oh, Lord, I've been to hell.  Yeah.  Spinal tap.  Spinal tap.  You could definitely hear the Jesus Christ Superstar.  Oh, yeah.  You better close your eyes.  By your tail.  He's doing it. 
[01:56:30]  He's singing his balls off.  Is he still alive?  He is, right?  Yeah.  Yeah, he should be.  I don't know where he's doing.  He probably meant that because of that fucking voice.  He's got that heavy tremolo and this rock screamy to it.  Yeah, maybe that.  Or maybe he went the way the great battle guys sing.  Yeah.  It makes sense.  Hearing the vocals.  Yeah.  That's a great voice, man.  Yeah. 
[01:57:00]  Play just a little more.  Find a place to cut it off and we'll be back.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I'm gonna leave you hanging here.  Oh, no.  I'm gonna leave you hanging here.  Oh, no.  Oh, no.  Oh, no. 
[01:57:30]  Oh, no.  guitar solo 
[01:58:00]  guitar solo 
[01:58:30]  guitar solo 
[01:59:00]  guitar solo 
[01:59:30]  guitar solo 
[02:00:00]  guitar solo 
[02:00:30]  guitar solo 
[02:01:00]  guitar solo 
[02:01:30]  guitar solo  I say Metallica.  I hear Metallica 1.  But it also, it sounds like something in another classic rock song.  It does.  It's driving me nuts.  Or maybe it is just Metallica, but it goes...  Yeah.  Yeah.  Does anyone know?  I don't know.  Wait, it could be...  For Metallica, no, wait, that could be... 
[02:02:00]  Instead of one, it could be Am I Evil?  The beginning of Am I Evil?  How's that?  I believe so.  Da-da-da-da-da.  Da-da-da.  Oh, gosh.  Am I as nutty as a bunch of fruitcakes or what?  Yes, you are.  Yes, you are fucking thick.  Yes, you are.  Yes, you are.  Yes, you are.  Yes, you are.  Yes, you are.  Fucking thick.  Fucking thick.  So thick I make the devil.  I don't know.  I don't know.  Maybe someone will come up with it.  I think it's Zeppelin or something.  Yeah.  It might be.  I just don't...  It sounds like Metallica to me. 
[02:02:30]  Wow, a lot of people are fucking calling.  Who's answering the phone?  Anything?  Oh, boy.  Da-da-da-da.  Oh, boy.  Who's on the phones?  Where is it?  Oh, boy.  Everyone is calling, so...  Sex man.  People think they know it.  What are they saying?  E-Rock, who's on the phones?  It's going to be 20 different songs.  All the calls just came in, so we're finding out.  It's going to be 20 different songs.  Achilles' Last Stand?  Zeppelin?  I'm going with that.  I don't know that one.  I think I might have just nailed it.  What are they saying? 
[02:03:00]  Who's screening calls?  Holy fuck.  He's having a conversation with people?  All he needs is what song?  Thanks.  Bye.  Who's the screener?  He won't tell us.  Who's the screener?  Are you allowed to tell us, or is that part of the new rules?  Oh, my God.  We're trying to...  They're not telling us anything about the song.  Who's the screener?  Connor's screening right now.  Oh, no.  Rob had to go do production room.  Oh, no.  You know what?  Connor's her own phones.  Connor's messed up many times before.  Who the fuck is this? 
[02:03:30]  Kyle, are you?  Yes, sir, you are.  Yeah, what do you got?  I'm so sorry.  It's Love Gun by Kiss.  Wait.  Da-da-da-da-da.  Da-da-da-da-da.  Yeah, you know what?  Really?  Yeah.  Love Gun.  Good call.  I don't know if I'm thinking Love Gun.  Play Love Gun.  Da-da-da-da.  Da-da-da-da.  There might be a bunch of...  Hang on.  Good one.  More.  A little more.  Yeah, we need a little more of that.  Good one.  That was fine right there.  That was the live version.  That's fine.  It's Fuffle Live, too. 
[02:04:00]  Why would you only play that much?  Is it fucking Love Gun I was thinking of?  That's the beginning, but...  Hold on, man.  I bet you we get ten answers.  I didn't think of Love Gun.  Da-da-da-da-da.  Da-da-da-da-da.  Ba-da-da-da.  Not the best lyrically, but...  All right, let me try another guy.  Who's this? 
[02:04:30]  Who's this?  Hello, you're on the air.  This is why we don't do live phone calls, by the way.  You have to screen them.  Yes.  What do you got, buddy?  Fast.  School's out by Alice Cooper.  What?  School's out by Alice Cooper.  Maybe School's out.  Da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da.  We're going to get 50 songs.  I know, I like this stuff.  Yeah.  Yeah, he rock.  Well, now we've got to wait for the part.  No, we're not going to do that. 
[02:05:00]  That builds quick.  There might be a part in it, though, that it doesn't.  Just like it did in the Deep Purple song.  All right.  How about...  Fiddle.  Sticks.  Yeah?  Mr. Rubbano?  Which song?  The End of Lady.  Oh, my God.  Dude, I think that's it.  I think it is, too. 
[02:05:30]  Go to the End of Lady.  It was driving me nuts, because I'm like, it's another classic rock band, which we consider  classic rock band, from the same fucking vibe period.  I don't know Lady.  Go to the End of Lady.  Did Jerry Lewis sing that?  Lady.  Smiling.  I don't know Lady.  I don't know what you're wrong.  I like Laddie.  I think that's the one I was thinking. 
[02:06:00]  I think that's the one I was thinking.  Although we're obviously finding out that a lot of bands use it.  But I think this is the one I was thinking.  It finally hit me.  I think you're right.  I'm saying Am I Evil is Right, too.  We're going to find so many songs, I've probably picked up that riff.  What does other people say?  Very end of Black Sabbath by Black Sabbath.  Jimmy, anything on that?  Oh, yeah?  Ba-da-da-da-da-da.  Yeah.  All right, go.  All right, let's do this one now.  Wow.  You might have to go on. 
[02:06:30]  Hold on, I've got to stop for a second.  Is this dumb?  No, because Sabbath was first.  No, I mean, is this dumb for everybody?  No, this is it.  Okay, all right, good.  Let's hear Sabbath now.  Go to the end of it.  Go to the end of it.  Iraq's panicking.  Iraq doesn't know what to do.  He doesn't know how to find his shit.  It's lower in the mix, but...  It comes at the end.  Oh, it does, okay.  I haven't heard this song in a while.  Got it, yeah. 
[02:07:00]  It's in every song.  That's the problem.  Yeah, a little bit.  But I think that Sabbath was first.  I can't argue that, really.  What year was that song?  1968 or nine.  Oh, boy, everyone's ripping off Sabbath.  That's right.  Hold on a minute.  Huh?  Stranglehold. 
[02:07:30]  Ted Nugent.  The breakdown of that song.  Yeah.  But I think I got mine.  I think it was Lady.  I think it was.  What I was thinking of, but...  Yeah.  How about how many more times by Zeppelin?  Iraq, are you okay over there?  Yeah, hang on.  Oh!  No, no, no, no, no.  Hey!  Hey, everybody out there.  Hence why I asked if he was okay,  because I was actually asking if he was okay,  because it looked like he was in a tough spot  trying to find this stuff.  But also, I saw that he was panicking.  Everyone out there, just hold on. 
[02:08:00]  Iraq says hold on.  All right, we'll hold on.  You all just wait.  This is why it would help if the phone screener  was getting the songs.  This is the end of the song for...  for Let's Eppelin as well?  Well, I don't know if it's...  How many more times?  Well, part of how many more times?  Oh, boy.  And of course, Todd in Harrisburg.  Bravo.  It's Valero.  What?  Classical music.  It's Valero.  No, it's not.  It's sick fucking puppies.  Igloos melting.  Sick fucking puppies never did that. 
[02:08:30]  Didn't Jeff Beck do Valero?  Dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun.  Jeff Beck.  There's Kevin from Connecticut in that damn room.  He knows this shit.  How about that?  He said, just an old-fashioned love song by Paul Williams.  Oh, he just has to be an asshole, right?  He's got an old face in...  Dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun.  Playing on the radio.  Whoa.  Devil music.  No, don't touch me like that.  You don't like it?  No.  Can I sing it out? 
[02:09:00]  I don't care.  It's kind of funny.  I didn't know what you were doing first.  He rocks listening to the whole song until he finds it.  Oh, is he?  Yeah.  Yeah, what are you doing?  They're fucking having a party?  Poor boy.  Exactly.  Dancing around.  Did he find Valero?  How do you even spell that?  With a V.  V-O-L-E-R-O.  V-O?  I believe so.  Volero.  That is Black Sabbath by Black Sabbath.  That's fucking shit.  But they might have ripped off Valero.  No.  Which was first?  And I think Jeff Beck does a version of Valero.  Oh, no.  I think... 
[02:09:30]  You don't mean Valero?  With a B or a V?  Oh, it might be.  Oh, no.  Is it Valero?  Is it Ravel's Valero?  Yeah.  Yeah, that's a B.  Yeah, yeah.  Boy, I'm heating up right now.  That's all right.  I didn't know either.  You heard the confidence when I fucking schooled.  Oh, man.  Right?  Corn Evil number nine.  Yes.  Yeah, Dr. Steve even said Bolero. 
[02:10:00]  Bolero.  Bolero.  The artist is Ravel?  Ravel?  How did he say that?  Yes.  Ravel, yeah.  Ed said that.  Yeah.  It's an old-fashioned love song.  Playing on the radio.  I saw that documentary.  It was good.  Yeah.  All right, hold on.  I should have saw it before he got here, but...  It's an old-fashioned love song.  One I'm sure they wrote for you and me.  Yeah.  Just an old-fashioned love song. 
[02:10:30]  Coming down in three-part harmony, yeah.  You're going to hear it here.  It's right there.  Mm-hmm.  But it builds.  You hear that?  Sounds like taps.  This is the only short version.  Usually it's 16 minutes.  Oh.  What year is this?  Oh, boy.  It's one of those years that you can't even imagine.  Oh, it's fucking like crazy.  Like 1380 or something.  Oh, shit. 
[02:11:00]  Like the plague was around and shit.  Right.  They were playing this on fucking like flutes and lutes and shit like that.  Yeah.  Could have been 10, 12.  Yeah, this is silly music.  Yeah.  This is a boring version of it.  I think someone like, I think Jeff Beck did a version of this where he really pumped it  up with the guitar.  Did he?  I keep saying it, but I don't know.  Like Gary Howey?  We can move on.  I mean, I guess we get our point.  It's in a lot of songs, right?  It's in a few songs, then.  We just heard it and thought like, yeah. 
[02:11:30]  Da-da-da-da-da.  Da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da.  Da-da-da-da-da-da.  And I know Metallica's got one like that, too, so.  Yeah, they just speak.  Yeah.  It's Am I Evil, the intro.  All right.  Pull.  That's it, that's it  There's different versions of it  It's such a good  They didn't like this either  Wow, a lot of bands knew that this was a riff to do 
[02:12:00]  People wanted to hear that  Who's song is this?  I want to see  This is Satan's music  This is a cover  The devil's music though  I'm not comfortable listening  Oh  Diamond Head, yeah  Thick as a Brick from Tulls coming in here  Grassroots keep me hanging on  Supposed to use it  Yeah, Thick as a Brick  Joe Walsh, The Bomber  Joe Walsh had some trippy songs 
[02:12:30]  Yeah  Alright  Why don't we listen to Louis C.K.  Ow  There it is  Want Louis C.K.?  Yeah, I want to hear Louis  I'm not going to be done with that shit  Well, it was driving us nuts though  When we were playing that  Oh wow, my Twitter just exploded  Now everyone has  It's like two different songs  Happy birthday to you  Santa Claus is coming 
[02:13:00]  These are just getting silly  These guesses  That's right  Absolutely Achilles' last stand  Right on  Great song  But no Zeppelin fans in the room  Alright, everyone just hang the fuck up  We're not taking your goddamn stupid ass  That's what it takes to get the phones ringing though  Today?  What the fuck?  It's a dumb little thing  Louis C.K.  The great Louis C.K.  Is he coming in soon or what?  He's got to promote his third season  Even though it's doing very well  I sure hope so  What episode are we up to?  Because I saw the first five  Did he do his Miami episode? 
[02:13:30]  That just aired last time  What a great episode  Yeah  Guys cannot show their emotion  No  Without people being suspicious of their  Exactly  Of their sexuality  Sexuality  Louis C.K. nailed it with that fucking episode  You saw that episode, right?  Yeah  Yeah, it was good, man  Louis is a talented guy  He wanted to just hang out with a guy around his own age  Because when you get a little older 
[02:14:00]  It's hard to make friends  And you feel that connection  But then it's weird as a guy  Because then the other guy's like  What the fuck, dude?  Louis is a weirdo on his show  You think he's a weirdo?  He's a weirdo in real life  I know  But that character on the TV show  Is a weird guy  You think?  He's a weirdo  Yeah  Louis is a weirdo  Weirdo  I love that word  I don't like that I can relate to him, man  He's a weirdo  Oh, boy  Oh, boy  I'm a weirdo 
[02:14:30]  What did he say about it?  Is it a motorcycle episode there?  E-Rock  Was that the first episode?  I probably did  Because I think four episodes are already gone  So  And now we can talk about the fact that his ex-wife is black out of nowhere  Even though his kids are white  No one wants to talk about this?  I haven't seen it  Yeah  I think we did, didn't we?  No, we didn't talk about it because no one saw the episodes yet  That was one of our spoilers  Oh, we did spill the beans  In season three  He's talking to his ex-wife 
[02:15:00]  She's on the phone  As Louis is having conversations  And she's  Black  Interesting  Yes  I don't know why  Well, that's why I want him in here  I want to talk to him about this stuff  I also want to talk to him about the motorcycle episode  Because he filmed all over New York on a motorcycle  Yeah  I want to know how hard that is to do  Hmm  How do you do that?  Probably very hard to get, like, permission  And then you've got to get some people off the road for a little while  Yeah  So  Yeah  Louis will be in soon, I'm sure 
[02:15:30]  Louis  But he was on the Daily Show last night defending Daniel Tosh  And he had a great angle on this whole thing  I want to hear this  And so I was in Vermont  And I was watching TV in a hotel room  And Daniel Tosh's show comes on Tosh.0  And it's making me laugh  It's a funny show  So I wasn't reading the internet at the time  Because that's how I go on vacation  I really hate the internet  So I just stopped reading it  But I'm watching TV  And Tosh is making me laugh  So I wrote a tweet  Saying you always  Your show makes me laugh  And then I put it down  And then, like, two days later 
[02:16:00]  I come home and I read  These, like, bloggers  And, like, Hollywood reporters  You know  Louis C.K. defends Daniel Tosh  Amid rape joke controversy  I had no idea  He got in trouble for making some jokes about rape  Whoa, wait a minute  So when he tweeted  He had no idea what was going on  He was just commenting on the show  That's what he said  Because I read that tweet  And I just assumed  He was sticking up for Daniel Tosh  Like, yeah, I saw your show  Really funny  Can we find that tweet from Louis C.K. 
[02:16:30]  He puts the tweet right in the middle  Of the controversy  Right, all hell's breaking  Listen, he just happens to be  I did not know this  He got me, too  Go to Louis' Twitter  So he's on vacation  He turns off the internet  He has no idea  That Daniel Tosh did the rape thing  And he's watching the show  Yeah  And said, oh, this guy's funny  Or this show's funny  And he tweeted about it  That's great  You got it?  No, it's gone  What do you mean it's gone?  It's gone  Well, it goes back a while, probably  This is June 27th  Before the controversy 
[02:17:00]  Sam  Sam  Did you take it down?  It's gone  Oh  Oh  I wonder what that's all about  Maybe they explained it  Sam, comment  Oh  Yeah, maybe he does explain it  You're not, comment  For making some jokes about rape  And I didn't know about it  And so I'm a defender of rape  That's what everybody says now  And they've read all this stuff  Like, shame on you, Louis C.K.  And I'll never watch your show  You're a rape apologist  I've been called a rape apologist  Because I said hi to a guy 
[02:17:30]  Wow  Yeah, I was tricked by that, too  Yeah  Yeah, I saw that tweet  Yeah, I thought he was defending him  Yeah, I did, too  Which is fine  And, you know, in his way  Defend the motherfucker  This is like a fight between  Comedians and bloggers  Which is, that's, we're all just  Just hyperbole and garbage  Comes out of those two places  Sure  They're all very similar groups  Yes  Just uneducated, unfettered 
[02:18:00]  Just  Say whatever pops into your head  Like, blah  Yeah  And you do it for hummus  It's also a fight  Between comedians and feminists  Which are natural enemies  The biggest, the easiest  Because  Stereotypically speaking  Feminists can't take a joke  And  Stereotypically speaking  And comedians  See  And comedians  And on the other side 
[02:18:30]  I'm going to have a chopper point  To send you back to Vermont  Right after the show  On the other side  Comedians can't take criticism  Comedians are big pussies  Yeah  And they can't  They can't  So  To one side you say  If you don't like the jokes  Stay out of the comedy clubs  To the other side you say  If you don't like the jokes  Stop googling yourself  Every ten seconds  Just nobody's making you read it  It's positive  To me it's all dialogue is positive  Wow  That's good shit man  Yeah  Good shit right there right  Yeah  You know what it is  A lot of comics were saying stuff about it  And they were the ones 
[02:19:00]  That made the most sense  I know you know  A lot of people think  Oh they have an interest in it  And stuff  For their own  Line of work  But  They were the ones  That actually were making sense  The people that were pissed at it  Just talking out of  Pure emotion  And  Sounding like assholes  What was Gilbert Gottfried's  Angle  He had an article yesterday  Oh he did  I didn't read it  I heard it was good  Yeah he was tweeting it like crazy  He was very proud of it  Well I don't  I don't go for his humor either  With the whole  Getting fired from the duck voice 
[02:19:30]  For that whole  Japanese thing  Oh I didn't go for that  Where the water went all over  The people's feet and shoes  I didn't like that  Oh I didn't like that one bit  You know who that voice  Reminds me of by the way  Remember in Jaws  The woman in the meeting  About Kutch and the sharks  She goes  It's not funny  I don't think that's funny at all  It's not funny at all  That's not funny at all  Not at all  That is who I picture  Every time we do that one  Not funny at all  Not funny at all 
[02:20:00]  That's a great saying  I don't find that funny  One bit  I don't find that funny at all  She's looking around  For support  Oh god for support  And a dumb thing  Doesn't happen  Now look  Have you watched Jaws yet  This season  You gotta watch it  Once a year right  I'm actually waiting  For the remastered copy  To come out  Why  You're looking all  Fucking digitally nice  And shit  I don't know  I don't want to see it  I do have to watch that  Like at least once a year  And the brilliance of that movie  The shark didn't work 
[02:20:30]  It's the only reason  It's as good as it is  Yeah if they put it in more  Intention of  They wanted to show  The shark a lot  And it worked out  That you know  It's way better  That you don't see it  Isn't that what they did  In movies like then  Was they showed you the shit  Like that was the first time  They kind of  Didn't really show you  Enough of it  But you know the story  Oh yeah I know  They couldn't get the shark to work  That's what I mean  Like even though it was accidental  They're like fuck  Everyone's here  So let's just film this  And hopefully we can  Figure it out later  And they did  Yeah  But it was good 
[02:21:00]  That you didn't see  A lot of it  Yeah it worked in their favor  Yeah  I completely agree  Because then in other movies  They showed the shark a lot  How about you use the same formula  That  And it sucked  Do you like two?  No  Two is  Probably the first one  Was the shark wasn't working  So they tried to put  A baseball hat on it  And people didn't like it  Baseball  I feel like it looks stupid  He has a Dodgers hat on  Because he's on the east coast  You don't like two  Two is alright  Nah but you know what  Three I don't even talk about 
[02:21:30]  One holds up  One holds up  It holds up very nicely  Yeah  Two seems very dated  It does  Why?  Yeah I don't know  Because they just had  Too many  Too many other people in it  Like the original  It was pretty much  Roady Hooper  And Quint  And you know  Peripheral characters  In this one  There was so many  And there were kids in it  So it was like  It looked so 70s  They were trying to like  Add more teenagers  And shit  Yeah  It just looked like  When you watch it  You're like  Okay it's fucking 1970 
[02:22:00]  Whatever  Right  You watch the original Jaws  You know  Obviously there's wacky hairstyles  And things like that  But you don't think  Oh it's the 70s  So I'm out on a boat  Louis C.K. had a little more  To say by the way  Oh did he?  Yes  And I see  I think you should listen  When you read  If somebody has the opposite  Feeling for me  I want to hear it  So I can add to mine  I don't want to  Obliterate theirs with mine  That's how I feel  Now a lot of people  Don't feel that way  For me  Any joke about anything bad  Is great  That's how I feel  Any joke about rape 
[02:22:30]  You know  Holocaust  The Mets  Whatever  Any joke about something bad  Is a positive thing  You have now crossed the line  Mister  But now  I've read some blogs  During this whole thing  That have made me  Enlightened  To things I didn't know  This woman said  How rape is something  That polices women's lives  That they have  A narrow corridor  They can't go out late  They can't go to certain neighborhoods  They can't dress a certain way  Cause they might get  Now I never  That's part of me now  That it wasn't before  And I can still enjoy  A good rape joke  So I have both of them 
[02:23:00]  But  Here's the last thing  I don't like the way  That you evolve as a person  No it's not  I don't like the way  That you've come up  With a way to grow  As an individual  No it's not fair  Be the person  That I knew 20 years ago  I will  But here's the last thing  I want to say about it  This is also about men and women  Cause a lot of people  Are trading blogs  And things about this  On the  You know with each other  Couples are fighting  About Daniel Tosh  And rape jokes  Really?  Yeah that's what I've  Been reading in blogs 
[02:23:30]  But  But  They're both making  A classic gender mistake  Because the women are saying  Here's how I feel about this  But they're also saying  My feelings should be  Everyone's primary concern  Now  The men  The men are making this mistake  They're saying  Your feelings don't matter  Your feelings are wrong  And your feelings are stupid  If you've ever lived with a woman  You can't step in  Worse than that  Than to tell a woman  That her feelings don't matter  So  So to the men I say  Listen  Listen to what the women  Are saying about this  To the women I say 
[02:24:00]  Now that we heard you  You know  Shut the f*** up for a minute  And  Let's  Let's all get back together  And  Kill the Jews  That's all I have to say about it  God  Louie  It's just  Great  It's hilarious  I love his take on shit  They edit the word shit  But they leave it  And kill the Jews  Takes good points  And  There's laughs throughout  The whole f***ing thing  Yeah  Good job  That's funny  Not that he needs to hear that from me 
[02:24:30]  But f***  Hopefully he'll be on our show soon  Yeah  I don't go for the anti-Semitic stuff  I dealt with that a lot growing up  Did you?  Yes I did  With what?  Your  Oh what's that?  My Jewishness  I thought it was with the gentleman  That would come over your house  No  They're black  I know  I thought they were anti-Semitic  What is this?  Achilles  Good quality 
[02:25:00]  Yeah it is  I think we  I think we realized  It's in every song  Sorry  Every single song right?  Achilles was driving nuts  I needed to know  Yeah  Achilles' last Dan Zeppelin  Yeah  Oh no  What is  Do you wanna  What is it  Do you wanna  Oh yeah I do  Oh yeah

[02:31:00]  All right, where are we?  Do you want to do more Chip audio?  What?  I don't give a fuck.  I don't give a fuck.  Chip the whole weekend was just talking about  how fucking sick he is  and just what a sick puppy he is.  He doesn't give a fuck about anything, apparently. 
[02:31:30]  I talked to him all weekend long  and he was telling me all these stories about...  I mean, he would flip off cops.  Oh, he's crazy, right?  He punches cars, you know?  I bet he's lying.  He goes right up to...  One time he punched a train.  Yeah.  While it was moving.  I don't give a fuck.  He just went up and punched it.  It's like, whatever.  He told me.  Did you?  Whatever.  Did he get to hang out with Jim at all?  A little, but not much.  Not much, huh?  Mainly Chip.  Mostly Chip.  God, you go on a trip with Jim  and you have to hang out with Chip the whole time. 
[02:32:00]  What do you mean, have to, fucker?  It's your lucky guess.  You got a couple of friends.  Yeah.  Oh, boy.  Yeah.  Why are they making a big deal  that Obama kissed Michelle Obama on the kiss camp?  I thought he didn't.  No, I saw a kiss.  I heard he didn't either.  I heard he didn't.  What game was this?  Oh, maybe...  They were lying.  Maybe after they were off the big screen.  Look.  There's the kiss.  Oh, shit.  She leans over to his daughter  and starts tongue-kissing her.  No, he didn't do that.  Oh.  What game was that? 
[02:32:30]  That used to be illegal.  That used to be.  Used to be.  That used to be illegal.  Dr. Gay is coming in with some information.  Dr. Gay!  I'm glad that's back.  Good.  Was that a WNBA game?  No, that was the...  Oh, the Olympics show.  Oh, yeah, the last warm-up game.  Exhibition game, yeah.  You know, they're playing the...  They're doing the Olympics in shitty London.  Yeah.  I just realized it's crappy weather.  Crappy weather.  Are they going to be running in the rain and crap?  Well, if it's raining. 
[02:33:00]  Do they have domes?  I don't know.  I don't know what they're doing over there.  Do they realize they have shitty weather  and they built some moves?  I think they know about the weather.  I don't know.  No?  No, shit.  What?  Some of that indoor shit, though.  You know, there's a lot of indoor shit.  Swimming.  Right?  Yeah.  We've got to watch the Olympics.  When does that start?  This summer.  But it's not.  No, it is.  It already is that.  If that was the last warm-up game,  that means it's happening really soon.  Next weekend, maybe?  I don't know if that was the last warm-up game.  Wow, we don't even know when the Olympics start  as a radio show?  Who knows?  July, I'm going to say. 
[02:33:30]  I'm going to say July.  It already is July.  Yeah.  Well, when?  Like, this weekend?  Uh, July 30th.  I'm going to say this weekend.  July 27th.  July 27th.  You were wrong.  Well, I mean...  July 27th.  It's going on on the 30th.  Is opening ceremonies the 27th?  It's the 27th.  Paul McCartney.  It ends Friday, July 27th,  and ends Sunday, August 12th.  Good.  It goes on forever.  You're going to watch?  It does.  You're going to watch it?  Yeah.  I'll watch it.  I, uh...  I like the Olympics. 
[02:34:00]  I like, I like, I like that curling in the Winter Olympics.  That's Winter, yeah.  I know.  That's fun.  I know.  Yeah, I like the curling.  You knew that.  But, um...  I like the volleyball and shit.  I'm like, who cares?  I don't give a fuck.  Volleyball's pretty cool.  I don't give a fuck.  I don't give a fuck.  What, do you don't like girls?  No, I do, but it's volleyball.  You don't like girls?  Tennis?  You don't like girls, do you?  Travis doesn't, no.  Tennis, no.  Tennis has its own thing.  It doesn't need the Olympics.  Yeah, I don't like things that have their own things.  Tennis that already have their own thing already.  I would watch archery, but they're all good, so, like, it loses fun. 
[02:34:30]  Why would you watch archery?  Why would anybody watch archery?  Archery in itself is cool.  If you and I went out and we did some archery...  I should do it, not to watch it.  Exactly, that's what I'm saying.  I think the Winter Olympics is much cooler.  Yeah, Winter Olympics has better stuff.  I really do.  They got triathlons in the Summer Olympics or anything like that?  I don't give a fuck.  You don't give a fuck, huh?  I don't try noathlons, I do them.  They got decathlons.  Oh, shit.  Decathlons.  Decathlons.  Decathlons.  What about the gymnastics?  Decathlons, decathlons.  You watch too much of that and you're called a fucking pervert. 
[02:35:00]  What about the ribbon play?  What's that?  That ribbity thing.  That's a real thing, right?  Ribbons?  Yeah, that's a real thing.  Run around with ribbons?  Ribbon play, I call it.  Yeah.  Do people win a gold medal for ribbon play?  Yeah.  They sure do.  I could win that.  Like, cycling, like, who cares?  Yeah, because it...  That has their own thing.  Canoe sprint?  Like, table tennis?  Like, canoe sprint doesn't have its own thing, so I'll watch that.  Oh, you know what?  I watched a little fencing four years ago.  Fencing?  That's all right.  Whoa.  Sword fighting.  Fencing stinks. 
[02:35:30]  Fencing stinks.  Fencing stinks.  Sword fighting's fucking horrible with guns.  I'll get a sword fight.  I'm swashbuckling!  Oh, what are you doing?  There's a parrot on my shoulder!  What about sailing?  Quiet!  I'm swashbuckling!  Don't knock over my little mole with my mustache!  My swashbuckler's hat!  Yeah, man.  When guns were invented, that was a waste. 
[02:36:00]  I've stabbed ye in the heart!  Quick!  Point your feet out in opposite directions!  Skip, skip, skip, poke!  Skip, skip, skip, poke!  Poke, skip, poke, skip!  Ted, it's called a foil, I believe.  A foil?  I don't like it!  You can use a foil.  I don't like a foil!  I prefer Sur-Ad-Rap, Gregory!  That was Ted Chipperson!  Yes, Ted Chipperson!  I used to fence when I was a boy, Gregory! 
[02:36:30]  I was poked through the eye!  Yes, I was!  What happened?  I don't know!  I just heard a zipper!  And my Uncle Paul said,  We're gonna go fencing now, Ted!  And then he fenced my face for a long time!  I didn't care for it at all!  He was his flesh foil?  I don't know what he called it!  He told me to close my eyes and get fenced!  And he said,  The only way to defend it was to open my mouth and make the ahhh sound!  He said,  Theodore, open your mouth and go ahhh!  Weightlifting! 
[02:37:00]  Weightlifting's in your mouth!  Weightlifting's stupid!  No, it's good when they can't sell it!  Yes, that's so heavy!  Why would you pick up something so heavy, Travis?  You can hire people!  Blacks do that, don't they?  Oh, goodness!  What's the head?  Well, that's a question, not an observation!  He's trying to get some knowledge.  He doesn't know.  What sports are you gonna watch?  Shooting.  Wrestling.  It's not the wrestling you like.  The Roman Greco?  John Cena.  Isn't it gonna be right now? 
[02:37:30]  Roman Greco?  I chumplen of Greco-Roman Wrestle!  I and she could kill all of them.  Really?  Yep.  Bob Backlund could, too.  Is there a sport just called athletics?  What is that?  Let me find out for you.  It just says athletics.  It's probably being athletic.  What is athletics?  I don't know.  Isn't the whole thing athletics?  I would think.  Running.  I bet it's running.  Running is running.  What's athletics?  Athletics appears to be running.  But then why isn't it in the running category? 
[02:38:00]  Let me find out for you right now.  That's dumb.  There is no running category.  Oh, you know what?  It might be the old trek and field.  They just renamed it athletics.  What about equestrian?  Oh, God.  Isn't that stupid?  The horse.  The horse doing the fucking work.  If the horse decides to have a bad day, you're fucked.  And you trained all those years.  Summer Olympics, way worse than Winter Olympics.  And if you win, it's like the horse fucking won.  The horse really won.  Trampoline.  Why can't I take a horse on the fucking track and field?  Or the hurdles.  Yeah, nice.  Watch me fucking win a gold medal if I have a horse on fucking track and field. 
[02:38:30]  Oh, I could use them in this horse fucking category.  It really reads like they had to think of things to add.  Yeah.  You know?  Yeah.  Do they have target shooting?  Yeah, shooting.  Daisy picking.  That's fun to watch.  Yeah, the guy from Huntington's in the Olympics.  What's he doing?  Sailing?  That's another thing.  Oh, God.  I'm embarrassed.  The wind, a boat, and the water.  They should combine fencing and sailing.  Then it would be real swashbuckling.  Oh, no wind.  No wind. 
[02:39:00]  I guess we lose.  You know what?  What about rowing?  I think this Olympics thing is going to be a big bust.  Yeah.  It's not going to work out.  It's a fad.  Diving stinks.  Oh, he barely made a splash.  It's all about the splash.  Is it?  Yeah.  I'm really trying to think.  I would watch the men's basketball, because you never know.  They're supposed to kick everyone's ass, but then it gets, there's always some kind  of weird surprise there.  When Greg Louganis hit his head, and everyone just jumped out of the pool. 
[02:39:30]  The AIDS pool.  It's like, it's AIDS pool.  The AIDS pool.  It became the AIDS pool.  Didn't they drain the pool, because it was back in the day when they weren't quite sure.  No one was quite sure what it would do.  Like, fuck it.  Fill the pool in with cement.  Let's dig a new one.  I think they canceled the event.  Canceled the Olympics.  And he sat there all embarrassed.  The big village.  It would kill anything, won't it?  I think so, yeah.  Is he still alive?  Yeah.  We didn't lose him, huh?  No.  Right.  Huh?  I think he's alive.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Mm-hmm. 
[02:40:00]  This is our Olympic break.  It's pretty pathetic, because I don't think we care.  I think it's very accurate.  Well, I came in to talk about the kiss cam.  Oh, look.  They have that.  Oh, the kiss cam.  Yeah.  So, they didn't kiss the first time they were on the cam, and they got booed.  And then later on, in the fourth quarter, they got put on the kiss cam again.  Why?  So they could make up for it and get the shot.  And then, I'm sure no news agency showed the first one, where he wasn't kissing her for  some reason, because maybe he doesn't like her.  Travis, would you kiss the president?  There it is again.  For the bit.  That shit used to be illegal. 
[02:40:30]  First couple caught on kiss cam.  Well, why didn't he kiss her the first time?  I don't know.  Maybe he's the president, and he doesn't want to fucking kiss on the kiss cam.  You got to.  He's a leader.  He's leading a country in war.  He doesn't want to smooch on the kiss cam.  I don't blame him.  He didn't.  Why didn't he do the old fanny pat?  I'm just a dopey shark jock, and I didn't want to be on the kiss cam once.  I was on the fuck cam.  Yeah?  That's a good one.  Who was filming you?  Fucking everybody.  I was just giving my pecker to a deep.  Weren't you worried about people seeing you?  I'm the fuck. 
[02:41:00]  They should have put it on Biden and fucking Obama's daughter.  He just shoved his tongue down the throat.  See, that's what they usually do at sporting events.  Until that shit got out of hand, and they stopped that.  Like in hockey games, they would do the kiss cam, and then they would go to the, you know,  two players on the opposing team bench, and it was hilarious.  But then I guess too many people were complaining or something, so they don't do that.  That they weren't kissing.  Not enough kissing.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I think one of the Hulls, Brett Hull, I think, was a good sport. 
[02:41:30]  I remember him saying, ah, fuck it.  That's great.  Yeah.  He went with it.  It was hilarious.  And see, then people like you more.  You kiss guys, especially you.  I fucked the Olympics.  That's going to be a bust.  So let's get back to Chip at Comical Con, day two.  Again, I think Chip is incorrect.  It's Comic Con.  Oh.  What?  Well, Chip keeps saying Comical Con, but it's not.  It's Comical Con.  It's comic books.  It's not comical.  It's not comedy.  I thought it was comical.  No, it's comic.  Chip interviews Toad from Mario.  Yeah. 
[02:42:00]  Oh, no.  It's a little mushroom-headed guy.  Oh, yeah.  The guy walked around with a mushroom hat on.  A giant mushroom hat on.  Not a small one, either.  And no one laughs at these people?  No.  This is their home.  Yeah.  That's so weird.  Yeah, they don't get laughed at at all.  In fact, if you laugh at them, you're the fucking asshole.  Oh, you're the minority, right?  Yeah.  Minorities.  No minorities.  It's going to be the minorities.  Bam, bam, bam, bam.  Bowling for Behave.  It's the opening line. 
[02:42:30]  Yeah, but it wasn't sung, so I got confused.  Can we interview you for Chippa TV?  It's for YouTube.  Uh, sure.  We're just talking to people at Comic Cons.  What's your hat supposed to be?  Uh, it's supposed to be the mushroom hat for Toad.  The mushroom?  Uh-oh.  Like magic mushrooms?  Like you're going to get zooted or something?  Yeah, we're magic brownies, right.  Is that for a character of some sort?  Yes.  What's the name of the character, and what does he do?  Uh, Toad.  What's that hat?  Toad.  What does Toad do?  Uh, Toad is the servant for Princess Peach at the Magic Castle. 
[02:43:00]  Is that a comic book, or is that a film?  It was, neither was a video game.  Yeah.  That's a pretty wild hat, though.  Thank you.  Like you're on mushrooms or something.  Ha, ha, ha, ha.  Ha, ha, ha.  I got so fucked up one time.  I was smoking reefers and doing Mary Janes and whatnot.  And my friend's like, you want to do mushrooms?  I'm like, fuck that shit.  No, it's just at that point, you're just like, no, maybe later.  Yeah, I get too zooted.  I just get fucking crazy, you know?  Fucking throw shit at the cops and whatnot. 
[02:43:30]  I don't give a fuck.  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah.  It makes sense, yeah.  That's a cool outfit, though, man.  Thanks, man.  All right, man.  Oh, man.  Oh, the handshake.  You guys have this new thing.  And there's a visual, so you guys can see it.  You'll see it on the video once it goes up.  Yeah, I can't wait.  Where, when there's the awkward pause on the interview, Chip goes, thanks a lot.  And he ends by going like this.  Like, the shug, like the cool guy handshake.  He leans in to go in for like, yeah, for the cool guy, like, high five handshake thing. 
[02:44:00]  Yeah, it's terrible.  And they just look at him.  You didn't ask any questions.  Is anyone on to you ever?  No, once in a while, someone will recognize which one I'm wearing hats.  I gotta get a wig or something, or I gotta have a better wig.  But they all think you're just a guy with a YouTube channel.  An idiot.  And they're not sure how popular you are in that community, so they just go with it.  I think it's so weird, like, it's too weird to assume it's a joke, because there's no payoff to it.  No, there's not really a payoff, and no one comes to them later and says, hey, uh, by the way, you were on this show. 
[02:44:30]  And it's not like, like, Chip generally looks more stupid than they do, so it's like.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  It's not like they're made to look like a fool.  Boy, this thing really is stupid.  Well, we got Chip at Comical Con interviewing a woman with a very small hat.  What was the hat?  Oh, yeah, I forgot.  It was from Nightmare Before Christmas, which she, I believe, called Nightmare After Christmas.  Gotcha.  Can we interview you?  It's for the YouTube channel.  Yeah.  YouTube channel.  For Chip at TV on YouTube. 
[02:45:00]  Okay.  Hi, how are you doing?  Hi, what's your name?  Jackie Toulouse.  Jackie Toulouse.  I just saw you bump into somebody.  I know, I didn't mean to.  Fuck them.  What's the character?  I'm the guy from the, so it's the character from Nightmare After Christmas.  Oh, that's a very little hat.  Yeah.  Hold on, let me say it again like I've just seen it.  Oh, that's a very little hat.  What's the character supposed to do? 
[02:45:30]  Well, you know, he wanted to be, take Santa Claus's place, so he wanted to bring Halloween.  What the fuck?  Why?  Yeah, he kidnapped Santa Claus.  What happened?  God damn it.  I go.  What happened, though?  Well, eventually, Santa Claus escaped and everything was okay, so.  Why would he kidnap Santa Claus?  Because he wanted to get all the attention that he wasn't getting at Halloween.  He wanted to get all the attention that Santa Claus was getting at Christmas. 
[02:46:00]  That's such a little hat, though.  Oh, you're talking about to cry.  I feel like I should tickle you and make you laugh.  No, tickling me, my mother used to tickle me, and she'd always go, Chippa, you're not  supposed to have that reaction to tickling.  Oh, really?  So if somebody tickles you, then you'll scream instead of laugh?  Oh.  No.  I get like a little, I get a tent in my pants.  Well, then, I'm sure you don't have any diapers anymore, so we might be.  No, my mother would say to me, don't be such a, don't be a pud puller, Chippa. 
[02:46:30]  Don't go tugging your pud, Chippa.  How big is that hat?  Tugging your pud.  How come the wind doesn't blow that off?  That's amazing.  Or I've got a big head, so.  That's the smallest hat I've ever seen.  Tugging your pud.  Chippa, you're not supposed to react that way when you get tickled.  It's not appropriate.  Quit bucking your hips, Chippa.  Thank you so much for coming up and speaking to me.  I appreciate it.  Oh, my God. 
[02:47:00]  Another one that she ended the interview.  Yeah, she was done.  Okay, thank you.  Toad from Mario.  Quit bucking your hips, Chippa.  No, that was the small hat lady, sorry.  Chip interviews a woman and is interrupted first by Spongebob, then the Ninja Turtles.  Yeah, we were walking by, I guess, where they bring out the characters for the official booths.  Yeah.  And so first, when we were starting.  Whoa, whoa, whoa.  The official booths.  Booths.  I thought you said booths, too.  Booths, right? 
[02:47:30]  Yeah.  Booths.  Look, I talk shitty.  We all know that, but.  Booths.  Booths.  Booths.  Booths.  And then, yeah, Spongebob came out first.  Yeah.  And so he commented on that, and then continued with the interview, and then the Ninja Turtles  came out, and he comments on it.  So I just wanted to make sure that nobody was taken aback when this occurred.  Can we talk to you for Chipper TV for our YouTubes?  Sure.  Hi, we're just doing interviews with people for YouTubes.  What's your name?  Lindsay.  Hi, Lindsay.  What's your, oh, your hair was so red. 
[02:48:00]  It looks like there was a murder or something.  Oh, there was.  What, what is your costume?  Careful.  Careful.  And it's flexible.  What the fuck is that?  His nose looks like a pecker.  When I was a kid, I would tug my pud, and my mother would go, quit tugging your pud, Chipper.  Where do you live?  I live in Santee.  And then he just goes in.  Santee.  It's really close to San Diego.  Oh, okay. 
[02:48:30]  And what are you, what are you supposed to be here at Comic-Cons?  I'm just me today.  I had all fears yesterday, so.  Oh, you have very pretty hair, though.  My mother, you remind me of my mother, you look like my mother, but much young.  Oh, really?  I hope it's a compliment.  It is.  I love my mother very much.  I used to rub scented oil on her legs after she would walk and be tired.  Oh, you must have loved her very much.  She's a good lady.  So, oh, you don't have the, what are you carrying there?  I got a non-agraph from the Once Upon a Time people.  Oh, I wouldn't want that. 
[02:49:00]  And why not?  I don't know who the fuck they are.  Are they even fairy tales?  No.  And why not?  A bunch of bullshit.  You should throw that out.  You got a boyfriend?  I do.  Oh, I'm sorry.  How much was that?  What's what?  Your signagraphs.  This was for free.  They just gave it away?  Yeah, they signed it for free.  I fucking throw it out.  I'm, ah.  Hey, are you guys turtles? 
[02:49:30]  Hey, are you a turtle?  Are you a turtle?  How come no one's looking at you?  They're cheering somebody else.  Fucking asshole.  Sucker turtles.  They're not cheering for you, motherfuckers.  What the fuck?  Holy shit.  And these guys all take themselves seriously when they're the real characters?  Well, they had big masks on, almost like Disney characters.  They were dressed like Ninja Turtles. 
[02:50:00]  Yeah.  Oh, God.  So you couldn't see their faces, but the woman just kind of turned away from him when he  started going, fuck you, turtle.  Chip sure knows how to get right back to a question, though, after saying something very  inappropriate.  Yes.  That's fucking great.  Yeah.  What did he say?  Like, uh, he was talking about dicks, and then he goes, where do you live?  Yeah, where do you live?  Don't be a pud puller.  And I'm sure right before they're ready to go, ah, where do you live? 
[02:50:30]  Or like when Chip gets, like, tries to be nice, sweet, uh, you know, uh, mainstream  Chip.  Yeah.  When he just brings his voice up high, and he goes, oh, what are you doing here?  What are you holding?  Yeah, yeah.  It's very endearing.  Very sweet.  And then, and then he turns into a fucking asshole.  Just for no reason.  No reason.  Hey, Chip, do you believe in fairy tales?  No.  No.  We get so mean.  Chip is the worst interviewer ever.  He just makes his guests uncomfortable.  He's not here to throw her in the garbage. 
[02:51:00]  That was awful.  He didn't know the fuck they were.  Why don't we, uh, play one more in the last one, unfortunately.  Chip at, uh, Comical Con.  Yes, Comical Con.  Uh, the video will be up, uh, I don't know, within the next week, probably.  I'll say this week.  I'll try to get it up, yeah.  Great.  Uh, Chip interviews a lady in a R2-D2 hat.  What the fuck is this lady's Darth Vader hat?  Let's go talk to her.  Holy shit.  Hi, can we talk to you for YouTube?  That's a cool outfit.  Thank you. 
[02:51:30]  Hi.  Cool Darth Vader hat.  Is that heavy and stuff?  It's an R2-D2 Hello Kitty hat.  And, uh, no, it's pretty light.  It's made out of paper mache.  Paper mache?  Paper mache.  Looks like a giant toilet or something.  Oh, yeah.  Well, I mean, you could use it in a zombie apocalypse kind of situation.  Yeah, if you had to drop a deuce or something.  Yeah, you know, it'd be great for it.  It's kind of sturdy, light, you know, carrying it around.  You could just poop it and throw it on people.  It'd be great.  So, what's your character's name? 
[02:52:00]  I'm R2 Kitty 2.  R2 Kitty 2?  Yeah.  That's like R2-D2 by the cat or something?  Yeah.  Exactly that.  Did I touch your hat?  Yes.  Did you make that yourself or did you buy that?  No, I made it myself.  Those are really cool gloves.  It's like when you go to the doctor and they put that on, you know you're in trouble.  It's up there, you know.  Uh-huh.  And sometimes you pretend it hurts more than it does just to get them.  It doesn't really, you know.  I like you.  Oh, where's your boyfriend?  Oh, he's walking around here somewhere. 
[02:52:30]  Shit.  I gotta go before he gets mad.  I thought I was gonna get that, too.  God damn it.  I thought I was gonna get that.  I can't get no puss here.  That's really good.  Chip in his quest for puss.  For puss.  Fucking chip, man.  Nice.  That's very good.  I like that. 
[02:53:00]  Yes.  And there's video?  Mm-hmm.  Everything is on video.  Because I want to see his dumb face that he makes when people are just standing there  uncomfortable.  Well, the hats are fucking so stupid.  And his dumb hats.  And the trunk, of course.  I want to see your trunk.  Yeah, you gotta see the trunk.  And he does this thing.  For a couple of them, he wore this green frog hat.  Yeah.  And there's a tongue sticking over the eye.  And the whole interview, he's blinking because the tongue keeps getting in his eye.  And he's totally distracted. 
[02:53:30]  There's also another thing where now he'll ask a question.  And if they go on too long with their response, he'll just be dazed and obviously confused  and not paying attention and respond.  He can't listen to it.  I don't know what the fuck you're talking about.  So there'll be more on the video, obviously.  I don't know what the fuck you're talking about.  Yeah, I mean, there's over an hour of, Jesus, chip wandering the floor of Comic-Con footage.  Beautiful. 
[02:54:00]  There's tons of it.  Why don't we split, man?  I want to thank everyone that donated to the Steve C. Fund.  It's doing real well so far.  TinyURL.com slash SteveCFund.  Wow, it's pushing $8,000 already.  Oh, very good, man.  Thank you, thank you, thank you.  I'm sure MJ will be very happy to hear this news.  And she also wants, of course, MJ is Steve's wife.  She's looking for thoughts and stories about Steve so she could read them to Steve's son someday. 
[02:54:30]  Remember SteveC at gmail.com if you've got some stories for MJ.  All right?  And also our Chicago, July 10th?  August 10th.  I'm sorry, August 10th.  Friday, August 10th.  Friday, August 10th.  We will be at, it's called 115 Bourbon Street.  And it is in, what's the name of the area it's in?  Marionette.  Marionette.  Marionette.  Right outside Chicago.  Marionette Park.  We will be doing a nine-minute broadcast.  We hope you guys can come down and fucking hang out. 
[02:55:00]  We have a bunch of events planned.  Don't be late.  You'll miss the whole broadcast.  Yes.  It'll be fun.  We actually have a lot of shit planned.  If you're ten minutes late, you'll miss the whole broadcast.  But come down and hang.  It's going to be a great time.  And all our shit is on our Facebook page.  Opie and Anthony, one word.  Like us, motherfuckers.  We like the likes and the thumbs ups and the retweets.  We like all that shit.  And look at those things Travis put up this morning about the way the Miami Herald wrote  a story about Zimmerman.  And look at the way the fucking Boston Herald edited out a certain fact. 
[02:55:30]  The sister papers.  It's so bad.  To make it more sensational and more seedy than it was supposed to be.  What?  Yes.  Pieces of fucking garbage.  Making the story.  Making the story.  The media has literally, they have to lose their fucking content privilege.  Yeah.  Like the fact they can do whatever they want because they're the fucking media.  It's sickening.  Right.  I don't know what that means, content privilege.  I should shut up.  That's good.  It worked.  All right, man. 
[02:56:00]  See you tomorrow.  All right.  Later.  Bye-bye.  Oh, Gary Oldman tomorrow.  Fuck, we should promote that.  Gary Oldman will be in.  We're all seeing Batman tonight.  Yeah.  Or today or whatever.  Can't wait.  We'll have a little.  We'll talk about it without giving away spoilers.  Tomorrow morning, we got Gary Oldman.  And McFoley and D.L. Hughley.  Busy show tomorrow.  All right.  Enjoy your day.  Bye-bye.  You've heard about it.  You've waited four long hours for it.  Finally, the moment is at hand. 
[02:56:30]  After O.P.  Anthony Live is coming up next.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah. </pre>
