<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opened with a recap of their disastrous Halloween party.  Flavor Flav, believing it was a record release party, commandeered the event for an hour, introducing numerous family members and friends to a largely uninterested, predominantly white audience. Other hip-hop figures like Chuck D and Grandmaster Caz were also present.  The hosts debated the awkwardness of the situation and whether the event could have succeeded on a different network.  This led to a heated argument with a listener who criticized their previous comments on Flavor Flav's career, featuring offensive language from both sides.

The show then shifted to a discussion of Paul R. Nelson's extremely offensive political campaign ads, playing several examples of their outrageous and crude humor.  This transitioned into a discussion of sports columnist Phil Mushnick's criticism of their radio advertisement, which they interpreted as a critique of their ability to function outside of radio. They defended their past work on the XFL, emphasizing the risks they took.  The hosts also received a cryptic message about a deceased Super Bowl champion, prompting speculation.

The next segment included an interview with Paul R. Nelson, the Wisconsin political candidate. The interview, heavily punctuated by Patrice O'Neal’s offensive jokes targeting race, sex, and Nelson's opponent, “Wrong Kind,”  covered Nelson's stances on various political issues like immigration, gay marriage, and abortion, focusing on his ads, particularly one featuring "Bruce and Bubba". A potential on-air debate between Nelson and Wrong Kind was teased.  This was followed by a highly comedic interview with Borat (Sacha Baron Cohen), filled with jokes about Kazakhstan, America, and offensive topics including sex, race, and anti-Semitism. Borat discussed his movie, "Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," before leaving for another appearance.

The Borat movie's success was the focus of the following segment, which included a phone call with Joel McHale from *The Soup*.  The hosts discussed Borat's potential future, comparing him to Dave Chappelle.  After significant teasing, McHale eventually called back, discussing *The Soup*'s 103rd episode and the difficulties of producing clip shows. He shared an anecdote about a controversial judgment on Tyra Banks' web show.  A caller praised Borat, and the hosts discussed other pop culture figures like Chevy Chase, Courtney Love, and a fabricated story about Ivanka Trump and Topher Grace.  They jokingly suggested a “friends with benefits” relationship with McHale and discussed the strict rules around interacting with celebrities like Michael Rappaport and Dave Letterman. Patrice O'Neal joined, offering comedic commentary and promoting his shows.  A lengthy discussion on his views on animal treatment in the food industry followed, detailing his avoidance of veal and chicken.  The show concluded with stories about a street hat vendor and a recap of their top YouTube videos, including the "Nigga Nazi Challenge," and a promotion for their "Walkover Talent Show."


The next section began with Patrice O'Neal recounting childhood anecdotes involving near-drowning incidents. This led to a discussion on hunting and animal cruelty, escalating into vulgar conversations about violence, animal cruelty, and pornography. Several callers shared personal stories, including one about a daughter found on a porn website and another whose wife is an amateur porn star.  Patrice commented on relationships and dating, using offensive language.  The "Shame, Shame, Shame" segment highlighted a news story about a special needs student's excessively long bus ride. Jim Norton called in, discussing his stand-up and racial dynamics, using offensive language.  The final segment covered bizarre news items, including botched cosmetic procedures.


The show continued with a discussion about a woman suing a Harlem nail salon for a botched lip wax and then transitioned to penis pumps. Patrice O'Neal detailed his sexual preferences and experiences, including his "pussy day" routine.  A listener called for advice on pubic hair designs.  The conversation shifted to Rev. Ted Haggard's resignation after allegations of soliciting sex.  A female caller, Angel (20), proposed a "full swap" swinging arrangement with Patrice and his girlfriend. Patrice discussed his and his girlfriend's swinging experiences, and Angel expressed interest in meeting.  The show continued with listener calls and discussions about swinging,  Patrice's upcoming show dates (repeatedly corrected), jokes, and listener calls.  "Patrice's penis being in Vietnam" was chosen as the "Line of the Day," and the hosts mentioned Howard Stern running commercials on their show.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  It's the Opie and Anthony show on XM202 featuring Opie, Anthony and James Norton.  I've got some bad news.  Right from the beginning you knew this was different.  The infection was everywhere.  It was in the street outside.  It was coming through your windows.  It was a virus.  Terrible viral infection.  Gives people this incurable disease.  Fills their veins and blood with pure rage.  By the time they tried to evacuate the cities it was already too late.  Jesus Christ, five hours?  It infects, replicates and kills this fast?  These numbers can't be right.  The numbers are correct. 
[00:00:30]  I wish to God they weren't.  It's that one.  There is no God.  It's like some kind of horror movie.  It's such a great virus that you want to infect others like your friends and co-workers.  Sometimes it leaves pupsules.  There's nothing you can do about it.  God almighty.  You better stop this outbreak before it mutates.  They're highly contagious.  What's this rash from?  We're facing a new strain.  It can cause life-threatening bleeding or even asphyxiation.  Where is this frantic?  It's all over the place. 
[00:01:00]  All right.  We're coming out.  Here we go.  Shut up.  Anthony.  I'm a little dirty.  Wipe me.  James Norton.  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road.  It's Friday. 
[00:01:30]  Friday.  It's Friday.  Act like wherever you are, that's the place to be. 
[00:02:00]  Where'd you get that?  Out of the hamper?  Is that your little brother?  Sure.  He's a good-looking kid.  This is great iced tea.  This is great iced tea.  This is great iced tea.  Hey, Rhett.  Hey, Rhett.  He rules.  So stupid to moan.  He sure does. 
[00:02:30]  Good morning.  Welcome to the Opian Anthony Show.  The ONA virus spreading across America.  Hi.  Flavor Flav.  We discussed that all day yesterday, Patrice.  All day long.  Thank God.  No one raped my girl.  Oh.  It's close, right?  Every time I had to go to the bathroom, it's like somebody got a hair balled up in their fist.  It's like, I'm just going to leave this steak here with these lions for a minute.  What you a fat boy for? 
[00:03:00]  Come on, baby.  Flavor love.  Love me.  She's like.  She's a true one.  I got to love her for that.  Help.  Help me.  Come on.  You know you love me more than that.  Come on.  We were just trying to do an innocent Halloween party for our fans.  Oh, I'm so surprised.  And it turned out that Flavor Flav just hijacked the whole thing.  Thought it was a record release party for him.  An evening with Flavor.  Yeah.  An evening with Flav. 
[00:03:30]  How clueless is this guy?  It's a bunch of white people in the crowd, and he thought they were all there for him.  It was a-  Look, man, maybe-  It was an evening with Flav.  Maybe-  Brought out everybody.  He's a great performer, though.  He's 75, man.  He's still-  75.  Yeah, boy.  Blah.  Blah, blah, blah.  He's one of the greatest hype men.  He is the hype men.  He created hype men.  Yeah, I understand that.  But he really, really thought everyone was there to see him. 
[00:04:00]  He was a part of what we were doing that night, but he had no idea.  No, I guess he never got the message, or he did get the message and didn't care.  I don't get the message.  I don't think it was-  I think he got the message, and I think that he didn't give a good goddamn about it.  Didn't care.  He didn't care.  The radio audience only heard maybe five minutes of Flavor Flav.  He was on stage for almost an hour.  I think it was 55 minutes.  Introduced his family, his friends, one at a time.  Kids.  And they're all coming out, and they're looking at this audience like, what is this? 
[00:04:30]  What is wrong with this picture?  And Flavor Flav was the only one that didn't notice that there weren't any black people in  the audience, basically.  I don't think-  But I think P.E. has performed in front of every single crowd.  I mean, they did-  Yeah, that's true.  Oh, absolutely.  They crossed over.  And to the credit of some of them animals out in the audience, they were into Flav.  And I think some of his new stuff was good, too.  Yeah.  I can't- I just can't deny Flav.  I grew up on that. 
[00:05:00]  So-  You know what?  That's what I said.  Fantastic.  I said I didn't mind when he got out and started rapping and doing all that.  That was great.  But it was that babbling in between with introducing everybody.  Is that necessary?  I don't know how this became.  Somebody was- I think I was listening to Ron and Fez in the car.  So I don't know how- and oh, I was on Power Talk and I caught them.  And they were talking about how if this was another station, you know-  Yeah.  If it was Hot 97 or something, this would- that would have been the event of the year. 
[00:05:30]  Right.  It was a throwaway for your racist audience.  It was like-  Yeah, we're chanting,  And it's like- and then Flav comes out and he's- he had- and seen all of that.  And- and Graham- let me tell you something.  Grandmaster Kaz was there, who is arguably in the top three guys that- that you give credit  for creating hip-hop.  Right.  Raheem from- from the Furious Five.  Yeah.  Who you've never heard of.  But Raheem and Kaz is like saying, ladies and gentlemen, Frankie Valli, the first white 
[00:06:00]  man to steal blues.  Give it up for-  Give it up for, you know, who- who- you know, weird Johnny and Johnson.  It's like Kaz, the average person would go, Kaz, Kaz.  But it's- it's Cool Herc and then Grandmaster Kaz is people who created hip-hop and-  And they were there?  And- they were there!  We don't know.  And Hank Shockley- they were there! 
[00:06:30]  Hank Shockley, who was another dude, um, who they said looked like Mike Epps, the comedian  Mike Epps.  Yeah, okay.  He- he- he produced the entire Nation of Millions album.  The one with- with Don't Believe the Hype, Night of the Living, Big Says.  The- the- the biggest- they're one of the biggest albums of all time.  The top five, to me, biggest hip-hop albums of all time.  And-  He was there?  He- they all was there!  I think Melly Mel was there!  Run DMC was- 
[00:07:00]  So, if this was like at the BET Awards or something, and they came out on stage, the audience would  have gone crazy.  Because PE's been broken up for a few years now.  Yeah.  And I don't know if they broke up on bad terms or not.  I don't know that story, but they haven't been around in a long time.  Chuck is like- he's- he's on- on Air America.  He's like real- you know, super political.  He's always political, but now he doesn't rap.  He's like, you know, you know, he's a real respectful guy.  He's a nice guy.  And they haven't been together in so long, but if this was- I'm- I'm- I'm saying- you 
[00:07:30]  can say Hot 97, right?  It doesn't matter.  Who cares?  So, if this was Hot 97 or if it was, you know, 107, this- it would have been the biggest-  Biggest event of the year.  It would have been covered by the newspapers.  It would have- it would have been huge.  And the media all over the country.  Ebony and Jet cover stories.  The slaves did an impromptu concert.  He brought his mama, his kids, his kids' kids, his crew, Grandmaster Cass, it was- Chuck 
[00:08:00]  D was there!  And Chuck D was there with the intention of being a rapper.  Right.  Which he has not been in a long time.  He hangs out with Janine Garofalo now and has the radio thing.  And it was wasted.  On Grand Wizard costume and not know- and you- you were pretty funny, though, because  every couple of minutes you would go, get rid of the flavor, flavor.  Flavor, flavor, everyone.  Flavor. 
[00:08:30]  I was just trying to get him off the stage.  Get him off!  All right.  The easiest way possible.  Let's do it on.  And then I would reach over and I would say to Obie every couple of times, what he's  doing now is called scratching.  Scratching.  I looked at Patrice at one point and I go, Patrice, now I know how you feel.  This is scratching.  Being the only black man in a white man's world.  It felt really good.  Oh, I'm sure it did.  I was very happy to see you two jackasses sitting in your head.  You had your hands in the air like you just didn't care.  I saw you leaning back in your seat, smiling, going, oh, you were savoring the moment. 
[00:09:00]  You were taking pleasure.  Stupid wizard costume on.  Dude, I had my wizard.  I did.  I looked like the grand wizard of the Ku Klux Klan.  Dude, you were taking pleasure in the fact that our show was hijacked by this.  And then...  Did you notice the costumes as this whole event's going down?  Like you said, Flavor Flav and Chuck D performing for the first time in who knows how long.  All these legends of hip hop.  And in the audience, there's a guy, well, you can't say it over here, but he's dressed  as a male member.  Right.  Yeah.  You got No Filter Paul in blackface on the side of the stage. 
[00:09:30]  And you had a guy as Flavor Flav.  As Flavor Flav.  As Flavor Flav.  As Flavor Flav.  As Flavor Flav.  You got a flasher.  You got all these crazy costumes.  Here's what made me...  I can't tell you how happy I was that you still had to do the costume party after Flav shut  it down.  I was like, hey, fellas, take care of yourselves.  Yeah, you left it to posse.  I'm out.  You left it to posse.  I'm out.  You still had to do that dumb costume party.  Yep.  And the psychos were standing there still waiting to show their costume. 
[00:10:00]  Nobody cared.  It was like, no flavor.  At that point, it was over.  Oh, he just destroyed our whole show.  He destroyed the energy.  Nobody.  You know what it was like?  That would have been like Simon and Garfunkel getting back together in front of the Nation  to Islam.  Yes.  At Mas No. 7 in Harlem.  Yeah.  And here it is.  A little brother. 
[00:10:30]  And the sounds of silence.  Kick it.  And this is my mom.  And I'd like to introduce Barbara Streisand.  Come on out, Barbara.  Come on out.  And the people would have been there like, when are these white people getting off the stage?  I don't get this.  I didn't pay for this.  I didn't want to see this.  Not knowing that it's like the biggest thing ever.  They bring them back.  A lot of hip-hop legends on that stage, huh?  I am a rock. 
[00:11:00]  I am a not.  Time, time, time.  I don't.  See what they've done to me.  And they're doing that while everybody's waiting to do caramel apple dipping.  Hey, where's the caramel apple dipping contest?  How about the guys that are on stage?  They're pretty much naked except for their underpants.  And they got glue traps all over their bodies.  And that's when Flav decided to come out.  So then these guys are standing on stage just awkwardly waiting to move on with the glue trap bit. 
[00:11:30]  You gotta love his ethic, though.  The dude was performing in front of just a crowd full of Klan members with costumes and just frothy eyes.  And Flav just in this state of just, I don't know what stage is in.  I can't call it denial.  Doing comedy when people are booing you at the same time as people are laughing is denial.  Like, you're like, all right, let me just focus and plow through this.  But he was not, he was truly, he was going, yo, yo, yo, everybody say, oh, hey, yo, give it up for my mom, man. 
[00:12:00]  Yeah, my mom, and no, no, check it out.  And then he'd go like that.  He kept saying that.  Yo, check it out.  Let me tell you something.  Oh, he's going to tell us more.  Oh, he's going to tell us something else.  And the great thing is that I, for not for one second, did I not believe that it wasn't going to be a race riot in there.  Oh, please.  And to the credit of I don't know who, maybe Kenny, maybe the S1Ws that was with Flav. 
[00:12:30]  I think God intervened knowing that the body count would have just been too high.  All I want to ask you, for people that were there, all the ONA crowd, where, when Flav was performing, where was the, where was it, gangsters?  Where was it, bothering poor Billy Burr?  Blue Billy.  Where was it with Flav and his, and a crew of Negroes? 
[00:13:00]  We called them out on it yesterday.  Where were you?  Because they're saying.  Called them out.  They were starting, you know, every FM chance, and they.  They were out of control until Flav and Control.  They had some chance when, they had some chance when you came out on stage.  Oh, yeah, they were out of control.  But where were they?  Where were they when they had all these convicts on stage?  But when, but when the S1Ws and a couple of unknown Negroes that you don't feel safe with, good old safe Patrice, part of the show.  Yeah.  Real Negroes came in your face, dressed up as Mousetrap, dressed up as, uh, as me, dressed up as Flav, dressed up as Opie. 
[00:13:30]  Oh, Negro, Negro, Jew, Jew.  Where was it at?  Where was Rusty Flavor Chance?  Nowhere.  I bow to you.  Nowhere to be found.  I bow to you today.  He was in complete control.  Although I saw your real side, too, in the green room.  Like, Jim, I thought we were hanging with a real brother.  Let me tell you something.  I realized there were, there's so many levels of brotherhood.  And you're like, you're pretty low in the brotherhood ladder there, bro.  Let me tell you something. 
[00:14:00]  Um, and, and, I'm a homeowner now.  There's a different attitude.  I want to live.  You got to be responsible.  Now.  I want to live forever.  You, you know how to pick it out.  Now, Keith, you're a cop.  You know how to pick out.  When you're in the streets, you know how to pick out a brother that stays in a black neighborhood,  lives there, you know, knows a little bit of something.  Um, and you know the difference between, this dude will kill me.  This dude's face, he'll shoot me.  And this dude is somebody I can be Mr. Officer with. 
[00:14:30]  And some dudes look at you like, like I said, you can only go so far.  Right.  I'm hard enough to, to exist up, up to about 139.  I got 139th Street look on my eyes.  Wait, for the rest of the country, we got to bring him into this conversation here in Manhattan.  And, you know, Whitey, uh, in general, we get scared going above a hundred, uh, hundred street.  Yeah, we go a little higher than that.  About it.  We can go a buck ten.  The average.  We can go a buck ten.  The average white Joe.  One ten, and it depends on, far on the, on the west side. 
[00:15:00]  And also for the rest of the country, we're broadcasting right now on 57th Street.  So we could go from here north to about a buck ten, maybe.  That's, that's, that's pushing it.  It depends on, uh, uh, what time of day it is.  But you're saying you could go all the way up to 139th Street.  Flav had, you know, I mean, look at this.  Like I said, my girl was there, and dudes would try to whisper in the air a couple of minutes.  Yeah.  Go to the bathroom.  Come on, go, you guys.  It's like, okay, I would, if I had to, I would. 
[00:15:30]  Oh, boy.  And I was not looking for that, because he was with four.  Now, he had about 20.  Yep.  I'm not counting the two S1Ws who are, security first, were the two dudes that were watching the quiet Kenny types.  It was two black Kennys that were floating around when Flavor moved.  Hand in the crowd.  They were dangerous.  But they weren't dangerous like, oh, man, he's this jerk off.  Excuse me, sorry.  They're waiting for somebody.  They are professional. 
[00:16:00]  For a problem.  He was with four dudes.  And now, he had 30 dudes with him, but he was with four that you look, and you go, they're looking to rob somebody.  Now, I'm going to explain something to you immediately.  We talked about someone's purse being lifted.  Somebody got their purse stolen.  Yeah.  Now, there's two things you know.  You know somebody can fight when they got cauliflower ears.  When there is a cauliflower, you go, this dude fights, and he likes it, and he doesn't care that his face.  When you see somebody with a tattoo on their neck, they don't care. 
[00:16:30]  They're not trying to get a job.  They're not trying to coexist with anybody when you got a tattoo on your neck.  And he had a couple of neck tattoo dudes.  And you could fake it if you want, but you see there was a couple that that poor security guard was like, all right, where's your Opian Anthony passes with your two faces on it?  With her goopy mug.  I think I saw a couple of ripped laminated backstage access passes.  We talked about it because the security at the Hard Rock Cafe didn't want to know nothing. 
[00:17:00]  They let all these guys right in.  The little swides.  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  No one wanted trouble.  The thing is, there was guys in there.  There were some guys in there at My Blackness, which is about 139th, hanging out with Flav, enjoying the residual Flav cooch.  Uh-huh.  Residual Flav fame, blasey, blasey, blasey.  But he was with dudes that just wanted to cause some problems that look you up and down.  Yeah.  You know, and get you.  It's as simple as that. 
[00:17:30]  And Opi was starting trouble in that room.  Saying, oh, because Voss said something.  And Voss got so scared.  Oh, yeah, because you wanted to drag him in.  I took pleasure in that because Voss was getting all cocky back in the safety of our white green room.  And I'm like, all right, why don't we go across the hall and tell Flav what you just said.  I made the mistake when I first got there of walking into the smaller dressing room that was Flav's.  And it was ours last year.  Yeah.  And I walked in just blindly.  Just turned the corner and walked in. 
[00:18:00]  And a couple of his boys were in there.  And I just went, I went, hi, gentlemen.  And didn't get an answer.  Got this look like, what the hell are you doing in here?  And then I just went, okay.  I turned around and walked right out.  Walked right out.  These guys wanted no part of me.  They did no clue that I even belonged in there.  This is becoming an ugly scene.  But he's beloved, though.  That's another thing.  I'm not going to say Flav, that's who he is. 
[00:18:30]  He's just beloved by the hardest of the heart.  I mean, Flav is a hero to the, you know.  Somehow they know who to latch on to at any given moment.  And Flav will love, man.  Flav's got some popularity now, again.  Massive show.  In the hood, it is bigger than NBC Nightly News.  Yeah.  Just huge.  It is humongous.  And I'm going to say something about Flav real quick.  That show.  I couldn't watch it for one reason. 
[00:19:00]  I've seen all kinds of porn.  All kinds of porno.  And nothing bugs me more than watching that old man kiss in the mouth.  No kidding.  All these girls.  It bothers me more than bestiality porn.  I have seen a pony do things to people, and I've watched it.  Man, hallelujah to you.  And tongue kissing, watching him tongue kiss, I can't watch it.  No, impossible.  I watched every episode of Flavor of Love season two, and you nailed that, man. 
[00:19:30]  Yup.  Like, oh, God.  It just tongue.  Time to fast forward.  Yeah.  All right, we got to take a break, but we wanted your take on that, because this thing  is becoming legendary now.  Flavor Flav came and just hijacked our whole Halloween show.  Nice hour and a half, because he did an hour in the middle before the show, right?  He did an, I don't know, he did about 10 minutes, then went back to his dressing room,  then came out and did almost an hour.  Almost an hour.  Thought it was his special day. 
[00:20:00]  I really loved it, dude.  You know, he thought it was a celebration because his record was dropping.  That's the Flavor I love, man.  Dancing around, jumping on speakers.  He's 97.  He's the best performer I think I've still ever seen, other than Run DMC.  That was amazing.  Yeah.  Watch his energy, man.  He's amazing.  I think we said it yesterday.  The performance itself, it was unbelievable.  It was fantastic.  And when he got together with Chuck D.  But you don't got to introduce your mother and your grandma and the kids and everyone. 
[00:20:30]  And the mics were broke.  And him and Chuck performed on the same mic next to each other.  Until we got the second mic.  Oh, man.  All right.  Patrice O'Neal filling in for Jim Norton today.  Jim Norton's down there in Atlanta all weekend long.  We got lots to do today.  We got Borat coming in today.  What?  What?  I don't know.  You don't know?  I don't know.  See, that's what it is.  It's like Borat showing up here.  You said, is he coming in today? 
[00:21:00]  The guy from the movie.  With the mustache.  You know who Borat is?  All the...  I know who Borat is.  Yeah.  Sasha?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Getting massive reviews in the paper today?  Everything's four star for this movie.  Do they love it?  They love this movie.  They more than love it.  Rotten Tomatoes is giving it 95% positive reviews.  There's only like two bad reviews of people that just don't get it.  He's the Andy Kaufman of our time, I believe.  Yeah.  I said that.  I said that yesterday.  Yeah.  He's doing some Andy Kaufman. 
[00:21:30]  He's easy.  He's in the character.  It's about time because so many people have tried since Andy left this earth.  Are you allowed to say his other character?  Who?  Ali.  G.  Ali G?  Yeah.  Yeah?  Because he might be super Borat now.  In character.  Yeah.  Ali G dead.  Oh, no, no.  He's coming in character.  He's fully character.  Oh, yeah.  Try to break him today.  Good luck.  He's doing all his interviews in character.  Good luck.  God bless him.  God bless him.  That's why I'm nobody.  If I did a movie where I play the character and they go, can you play the character? 
[00:22:00]  What?  No.  I did it.  I sold my soul.  Do I have to sell everything?  Can I love myself to some degree, you pieces of garbage?  Here's something that doesn't get it.  Stephanie in Pennsylvania, what's up?  Hey, guys.  Let's have to call you out because yesterday, you said that he was a has-been and his show  is done and it's over with.  And just because Patrice is there today, you're trying to backpedal and say what a hit is.  Patrice said in the community, it's huge.  I don't watch it.  I don't know anybody that does watch it. 
[00:22:30]  I watch the Flavor Box.  What's that, Flav?  Yeah, I don't watch the show.  White people might watch it as a guilty pleasure, I'm sure.  Nah.  But black people, it's gospel.  He said in the community, it's huge.  There, Stephanie.  We acknowledged that his performance was really good.  And yesterday, I said, yeah, when he was rapping, it was cool.  But when he talked, it was like, get him off.  This sucks.  We had a problem with him introducing every single person he knows.  Did you listen to what we said, Stephanie?  Now she's got me pissed.  We had a problem that he hijacked our show. 
[00:23:00]  What did you hear that we didn't say yesterday?  Yesterday, you said that his show is done, that it's over.  And it was VH1's number one show ever.  Stephanie, we did not say that, because we would look like jerks.  Everyone knows that Flavor of Love was massive.  It was like the biggest show in cable history or something.  If she was to say, if she's saying you said that it is over now, I can see that.  I can't see.  Oh, we said that.  Yeah, we said that it's not like, you know, he's going to get another show on VH1. 
[00:23:30]  So he's at the pinnacle of his career again.  No, he will get another show.  And he's hoping because of this.  He will get another show.  I'm absolutely sure.  Yeah, she's right about that.  Yeah.  Well, New York got one coming out.  Yeah, I understand that.  Selectively listening, Stephanie.  You guys try to get a little black when Patrice comes around, because you want to be his  friend so bad.  All right.  Ah!  Ah!  Stephanie!  Come on!  Ah!  That's hilarious.  She was a teaser.  She called y'all liberals.  Yeah.  Goodbye.  Yeah, what the hell is she doing?  Trying to get along with the black man. 
[00:24:00]  Go screw off, Stephanie.  You piece of crap, bitch.  Shut up.  I hate these people that...  Oh, I hate that whore.  I hate you, you whore.  Go satisfy your man.  Make him a cup of coffee.  I hate people that do their selective listening with this program.  We said the performance was good.  We were bummed that he was on stage for 55 minutes.  We were bummed that he completely hijacked the show and introduced everybody he knew.  We were bummed ourselves that we weren't brave enough to try to figure out how to move  him along, okay? 
[00:24:30]  We were trying to figure out who told him that it was his private party.  We said all that.  We said we had no clue who we were, what we were doing there.  I said flavor of love.  I love what...  Yes.  I said I love the flavor of love on VH1, but we also said that this might be the pinnacle  of his second career here, and it might be going downhill now, because he's trying to  use the success of the show to get the rap album going, and I don't know if it's going  to work.  I went to Virgin.  Me and my woman walked to Virgin after the hard rock. 
[00:25:00]  Is it Virgin?  Yeah.  And bought flavors.  Oh, see?  So it worked.  I bought it.  There you go.  Yeah?  It got a sale.  It got one sale.  Jay, what's up?  Everybody else there was like...  Yeah, I want to put Patrice up on something.  What?  I just want to put Patrice up on something.  What's up?  What's up?  Yo, man.  The backpedaling of these two cats is doing right now.  Holy...  Wait, God.  They're trying to say... 
[00:25:30]  What did y'all say yesterday?  Backpedaling.  Backpedaling.  So you're trying to say they're changing up because I'm here, but I want to not hear  the show up.  Why, first of all, why would we change up with Patrice here?  Yeah, we're not scared of Patrice anymore.  If Flav was there, I can understand.  I am, to them, safe Negro.  That's right.  For the first ten appearances on our show, we were petrified.  Look at the pictures of us on the website.  You will see our bored-ass faces sitting there 15 minutes in.  I'm leaning on my hand, looking at Flav.  I could care less who was up on that stage.  And I'm looking like, when is this going to end? 
[00:26:00]  There's no way to make this stop.  And then I'm getting people saying, I'm backpedaling.  What am I saying today that I didn't say yesterday or vice versa?  Give me an example, you dummies, you selective listening jackasses.  Why'd you cut off the brother when he was saying...  I'm just trying out my new bit.  It's his new bit.  But don't jump the gun too quick.  Yeah, don't shock him because he had a point.  I wish that dude had got a chance because I want to hear it.  I wanted to hear what that idiot was going to say.  All right, he could call back.  Backpedaling.  Let that guy call back.  Please call back because I want to hear what he did. 
[00:26:30]  It was nothing about what he was saying.  I can't backpedaling.  I'll just try out my new bit.  You stole my bicycle.  I was excited to try out my new bit.  Who stole your bicycle?  Now you're trying to be...  Backpedal.  Now you're trying to...  I said I can't backpedal.  He stole my bicycle.  Now you're trying to be extra racist, man.  It's just a racist.  Yes, I am being extra racist.  He's trying to keep it real.  Let me tell you some N-word.  I got to keep it real.  Why don't y'all be honest?  I'm not going to let this idiot call me up and say, and I'm backpedaling.  I'm saying exactly what I said yesterday.  I enjoy...  And I even said this. 
[00:27:00]  Oh, you backpedaled.  You said he sucked.  I didn't say he sucked.  I said when they got up there and he was actually doing...  Did you say Flave sucked?  No.  I said when he was rapping, it was cool.  I'm not into it.  Right.  But it was exactly what he was supposed to do there.  Right.  Get up and rap.  Not introduce 50 people I could give two Fs about.  Did you realize what show you guys...  Did you realize the show that happened...  Who cared?  You've got to understand the magnitude of the show.  I didn't care. 
[00:27:30]  You should care.  I shouldn't.  Now you don't care.  Darren, what's up?  I don't like extra races, man.  Hey.  There's a new superhero.  These exact words yesterday.  There will never be a season three of Flavor of Love.  Why'd you shock him?  Opie's crazy on the taser now.  Now he's just going to taser everybody.  Roger, go ahead.  Hey, I hate to agree with that stupid horn I called earlier, but you guys...  Opie's just tasering, tasering everybody.

[00:29:00]  We got a Paul R. Nelson ad, Anthony.  The latest Paul R. Nelson ad.  Really?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Oh boy, I wanted to play our Paul R. Nelson ID and it didn't work.  No.  Now it's working on its own.  Now I need to like reboot this thing.  Try this again here.  This is Paul R. Nelson and you're listening to the Opie and Anthony Show.  That's right.  Paul R. Nelson. 
[00:29:30]  Patrice, are you into these negative campaign ads?  Yeah.  Love them.  Watch them all the time.  Here's a negative campaign ad.  Dimitri Martin has got a big ad campaign, but go ahead.  Huh?  What?  I think my stomach hurts.  Who?  Damn it.  Never mind.  Oh, what?  What are you doing?  Just reading?  It just caught me.  I see Dimitri Martin's dumb face and he's like getting ready to be a millionaire.  Who's Dimitri Martin?  He's a nice guy. 
[00:30:00]  I like him.  Yeah.  I have no idea who that is.  Exactly.  Yeah.  Is he a comic or something?  Yeah, he's a new guy.  Oh, okay.  All right.  I get it.  Oh, now you're all eyes.  Just, you know, comic jealousy.  That makes sense.  Yeah.  You know how we are.  We're jealous.  All you comics.  Now I'm over it.  Now let's get back to business.  One guy makes it and it's like, ah, that's a son of a bitch.  That's what I'm trying to prepare now.  Everybody, they call me a son of a bitch now.  I got nothing.  If it was you, you'd be like, why is everybody hating? 
[00:30:30]  But when it's anybody else, it's like, yeah, this guy doesn't deserve that.  Didn't even put in his time.  I just had a burst of jealousy overwhelm me and I apologize.  It really did.  It washed over you.  Oh, and I don't even hate to meet you.  I just saw his dumb face.  You took us out of our game and everything.  Sorry about that.  Damn, is that a black guy we're supposed to know?  That's all I was thinking.  Now you got to be careful, y'all.  That was like, yeah.  We don't know.  I apologize for that, man.  Go ahead.  All right.  I'm sorry. 
[00:31:00]  No, we love this guy, Paul R. Nelson, Patrice.  We started playing negative campaign ads.  And the best ones were from Paul R. Nelson about this guy, Ron Kind.  Ron Kind.  And what he does, he puts a W, a big W in front of Ron and then a G at the back.  So it's Ron Kind.  His name is Ron Kind, but it's competition there.  Wait, what's the position and what's the state?  This guy, Paul R. Nelson's the Republican. 
[00:31:30]  He's a Marine, an ex-Marine.  Running for?  Running for Congress.  We don't know.  Don't even know.  I think it is Congress.  You're right, man.  Went for Congress in Wisconsin.  And he's running against a four-term incumbent, Ron Kind.  And Paul R. Nelson's team has put together this little ad where they put and say,  he's the wrong kind.  Yeah.  And it's just all negative stuff. 
[00:32:00]  And it's so far beyond any kind of negativity.  I mean, they're accusing this guy of all kinds of shenanigans.  Well, we got the classic one.  We should play it again.  Let's bring Patrice up to speed.  This is the one where we were playing a lot of negative political ads and they were all good.  And then we heard this one and it was all about Paul R. Nelson from that day forward.  I'm Paul R. Nelson.  Listen to this.  With our servicemen and women facing death every day,  what kind of congressman would try to gut military spending? 
[00:32:30]  The wrong kind.  Ron Kind.  That's right.  Congressman Ron Kind is repeatedly voted to deprive our troops of the funding they need to fight for us.  But Ron Kind has no trouble spending your money.  He would just rather spend it on sex.  That's right.  Instead of spending money on cancer research,  Ron Kind voted to spend your money to study the sex lives of Vietnamese prostitutes.  Instead of spending money to study heart disease,  Ron Kind spent your money to study the masturbation habits of old men.  Ron Kind spent your tax dollars to study something called the bisexual, transgendered, and two-spirited Aleutian Eskimos, 
[00:33:00]  whoever they are.  Ron Kind even spent your tax dollars to pay teenage girls to watch pornographic movies with probes connected to their genitalia.  Ron Kind pays for sex, but not for soldiers.  If Ron Kind had better priorities, you wouldn't be having to hear this.  Ron Kind is out of touch, and soon he'll be out of Congress.  I'm Paul R. Nelson, and I approve of this message.  I'm Paul R. Nelson, and I approve of this message.  Paul R. Nelson, he sounds like he has something tied up to somebody's genitalia. 
[00:33:30]  I'm sure he has a small child in a closet somewhere locked up.  Is he just the best?  We hated him at first, but now we love him.  We don't care what he stands for.  I just love the fact that he is willing to go out on a limb and put out a negative ad campaign like that.  Just the worst.  Yeah, well, we got the latest Paul R. Nelson commercial.  Oh, good.  And this one's supposedly pretty good. 
[00:34:00]  A new one.  No one has heard this yet.  All right.  Well, we have connections now in the Paul R. Nelson camp.  Yes, we do.  Because even Geraldo played that last ad on his show last night.  He did?  Yeah, it's all about Paul R. Nelson.  How did we pick up on him so early?  I don't know, but everyone's jumping on now.  Wow.  We just lucked out.  Yeah.  I would love to say we're that damn good.  We just lucked out.  We're like Kreskin.  But we have the brand new ad that no one has yet.  All right.  And we're not even allowed to tell people how we got it. 
[00:34:30]  Okay.  I don't mind as long as we have it.  Here it is.  The latest Paul R. Nelson campaign ad.  Dearly beloved, we're gathered here to witness the marriage of this man, Bruce, to this other man, Bubba.  If anyone objects to the marriage of Bruce and Bubba, let him speak now or forever hold his peace.  Well, preacher, I object.  Oh, thank God.  State your objection, sir.  Well, preacher, it's two dudes. 
[00:35:00]  Well, Ron Kind says anything goes.  He says I can marry anything to anything.  Well, preacher, Ron Kind is the wrong kind of guy to get advice from.  Hey, today it's two dudes.  Tomorrow it's two dudes.  A lesbian, a pedophile, and a partridge in a pear tree.  I think we better stop playing games with holy matrimony and leave things just the way God showed us in the Garden of Eden.  Adam and Eve, not Adam and Steve.  Romeo and Juliet, not Romeo and Julio.  I'm Paul R. Nelson, candidate for Congress.  I approve of this message, and my committee paid for it. 
[00:35:30]  If you support traditional American values, help me keep marriage sacred.  Vote yes on the marriage amendment and vote Paul R. Nelson for Congress.  Wow.  Paul R. Nelson.  Did you say Paul R. Nelson?  Does Ron Kind, does he have a guy?  I said, did you say Paul R. Nelson?  Yes.  Right about now.  I'm Paul R. Nelson.  Check it out now.  I'm Paul R. Nelson.  Right about now. 
[00:36:00]  I'm Paul R. Nelson.  Check it out now.  I'm Paul R. Nelson.  Right about now.  I'm Paul R. Nelson.  Check it out now.  I'm Paul R. Nelson.  Right about now.  About now.  About now.  About now.  Paul R. Nelson.  Paul R. Nelson.  Thank God almighty.  Paul R. Nelson.  Ha ha ha.  I'm Paul R. Nelson. 
[00:36:30]  Paul R. Nelson, tear down that wall right about now. 
[00:37:00]  I'm Paul R. Nelson. 
[00:37:30]  Paul R. Nelson has left the building.  How great is that?  The mega mix that one of the fans sent in.  Oh, God.  That song was stuck in my head all morning.  I woke up with it in my head.  I'm driving to work singing the Paul R. Nelson Funk Soul Brother song.  What do you think of the new ad?  I love it.  Wow.  They just have gone completely one way.  They've gone completely with the mudslinging tactic. 
[00:38:00]  Yeah.  And I hope it works for him.  I don't know – I know what his stance is.  It's really hardcore right-wing Republican, which I'm really not into.  I'm more –  I'm sorry.  What?  I am not into hardcore right-wing Republican politics.  I'm also not into left-leaning, bed-wetting liberal politics.  I like taking a little from column A, a little from column B. 
[00:38:30]  You make up your own mind.  Can you tell me what's the little from column B?  Because column A, we've seen you have Nazi helmets and guns.  You hate all races and creeds and colors.  Now, what's the other side that you take a little bit of?  You do see a lot of the right on me come out, but the left –  A lot of that comes out on the radio show, so it's actually a good question.  The left, I keep camouflaged a lot.  I'm a pretty charitable guy when it comes to things. 
[00:39:00]  You give the white charities.  Charity does not mean that.  White charities?  There are enough black people giving to black charities that I feel I don't have to slough up my hard-earned money.  You know what I get to black charities?  It's called my tax dollars.  Somebody on the left side, catch him because he's falling right on the left.  Hold on, he's leaning left.  He don't give to no nigger charities.  It's called my tax dollars.  Those are my charity contributions to the black community. 
[00:39:30]  What is the left side?  The left-leaning that I have a little bit?  Oh, my God.  I'm kind of with you, Patrice.  I don't really hear a lot of the left coming out of Anthony.  I'm not one of these staunch supporters of George Bush.  I think he's a boob.  I think –  That's not even – his wife don't even like him no more.  How about gay marriage?  Gay marriage?  I'm fine with that.  There you go.  Gay marriage.  Gay marriage.  He wants Bruce and Bubba to get married.  Come on, Tony Duke. 
[00:40:00]  Abortion.  I say let women have them whether they want them or not.  In some cases.  I say let the boyfriend make up their decision.  Oh, man.  Can I interrupt for a –  You almost ambidextrous.  Can I interrupt?  Dr. Martin to surgery.  Doc Martin.  Wham!  One right in the old bread basket.  You big phony.  Can I jump in here for a second?  Al from New York.  Al.  Hey, I just got to know.  Is that a bit you guys made or is that a real commercial?  See, that's what's getting so confusing now. 
[00:40:30]  People really think we're just making up Paul R. Nelson commercials.  That is a real Paul R. Nelson commercial.  The commercials you've heard are –  That's going to be hitting the airwaves very soon.  Genuine Paul R. Nelson commercials.  The song is a remix that somebody did.  That didn't come from the Paul R. Nelson camp.  Although, I think if he wins, they should play that behind him as he's accepting his victory at the podium.  All right.  Thank you.  Let's say hi to Steve in Jersey.  Steve. 
[00:41:00]  That was the greatest ad ever.  Please play it again.  Which one?  The Bruce and Bubba one?  Yeah.  Without a doubt.  Please play it again.  That is a good one.  All right.  We'll play that again.  Let's go to Bernie in Boston.  Bernie.  Bernie.  What's up, guys?  What's up?  Hey.  When are you going to have Paul R. Nelson on the show with you guys?  You ready for this?  7 o'clock today.  7 o'clock.  7 o'clock today we talk to Paul R. Nelson.  Talking to Paul R. Nelson.  Yeah.  By the way, the mega mix was done by producer Dan. 
[00:41:30]  He would like to mention.  Producer Dan.  Thank you.  All right.  Thank you, sir.  We're like Imus now getting politicians on the show.  Yeah.  Look at us.  Look at us.  Paul R. Nelson.  We got a congressional candidate from Wisconsin.  People don't understand how messed up this is because I don't think we agree with a lot  of this stuff he's saying.  No.  And we know that Ron Kine isn't obsessed with the masturbation habits of old men.  Yeah.  We know it was.  We see through all this crap.  Do you have his platform? 
[00:42:00]  Did they get, did these guys, did they?  You can't tell from that commercial?  But I'm saying all of his, his old platform.  It is so right down the right wing line.  Yeah.  I mean, anti-abortion, anti-stem cell research, anti-gay, anti-gay marriage, staunch supporter  of Bush and, and, uh, the war in Iraq, anti-sex in general, really, he's not, he's not, he's  just for procreation.  He's not into sex.  Seems like a very religious guy, very family oriented guy.  He's got the wife, the kids, the whole thing. 
[00:42:30]  And, uh, he's just using Ron Kine's, um, platform of, uh, what, what he wants, what Ron  Kine was doing was, uh, trying to get a bill passed that would fund a sex study that included  all these things like, um, Vietnamese prostitutes because of, uh, the spread of AIDS.  Like they wanted to see how that worked.  Uh, the old men taking care of themselves at the old age home is just like the sexuality  of older people and what they might need, uh, to make their lives a little better as 
[00:43:00]  they get older in that way.  Just this overall sex study.  But he made it sound like in that commercial, like he's pulling out tax dollars going, show  me some Vietnamese prostitutes.  Yeah.  I got some tax dollars here.  All right.  Hook up that electrode over there to that teen girl and let her rip.  You know, it, it, it's kind of taken out of context.  Oh yeah.  That is hot.  But I mean, by the way, that is, that is sexy.  And he justified it by saying, you know, if he wasn't doing these things, you wouldn't  have to hear it on our commercial. 
[00:43:30]  That's right.  But we're going to tell you anyway, because he knows it makes a good commercial on the  official Paul R. Nelson website.  We get a plug, uh, t-shirts, the Paul R. Nelson t-shirts are officially sold out.  And then he writes, thanks Opie and Anthony.  Yeah.  I guess a lot of the pests and fans of this show absolutely wanted the Paul R. Nelson t-shirt.  So they, they got, went to the website and they're wearing them now.  Just the dregs of humanity.  Why?  Walking around with a Paul R. Nelson.  Why can't you support, uh, I don't know. 
[00:44:00]  Because I'm Paul R. Nelson.  I'm Paul R. Nelson.  Let's play this spot again.  I guess nobody's serious.  Is that, is that funny?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Once again, here's the latest Paul R. Nelson commercial.  It's entitled Bruce and Bubba.  We can't write funnier stuff than this.  No.  Great.  Dearly beloved, we're gathered here to witness the marriage of this man, Bruce, to this, uh,  this other man, Bubba.  If anyone objects to the marriage of Bruce and, and Bubba, let him speak now or forever 
[00:44:30]  hold his peace.  Well, preacher, I object.  Oh, thank God.  State your objection, sir.  Well, preacher, it's, it's two dudes.  Well, Ron Kine says anything goes.  He says I can marry anything to anything.  Well, preacher, Ron Kine is the wrong kind of guy to get advice from.  Hey, today it's two dudes.  Tomorrow it's two dudes, a lesbian, a pedophile, and a partridge in a pear tree.  I think we better stop playing games with holy matrimony and leave things just the way  God showed us in the Garden of Eden. 
[00:45:00]  Adam and Eve, not Adam and Steve.  That's terrible.  I'm sorry.  Not Romeo and Julio.  I'm Paul R. Nelson, candidate for Congress.  I approve of this message and my committee paid for it.  If you support traditional American values, help me keep marriage sacred.  Vote yes on the marriage amendment and vote Paul R. Nelson for Congress.  Vote Paul R. Nelson, people.  Yeah, he'll be on the show in a few minutes here.  Paul R. Nelson.  This segs into something that's been pretty cool.  We've been asking the listeners to come up with anti-political ads for members of the 
[00:45:30]  Opie and Anthony show.  Yeah.  And there's a couple that came in that are really funny about Anthony.  Yeah, I don't understand it.  And listen to this really fast.  This is from Joe.  This is Anthony Cumia and I approve of this message. 
[00:46:00]  I don't think I approved of that.  Isn't it simple, short, and sweet?  Maybe before we get fired, we'll explain.  To help out the listeners, we all said, I'm Opie and I approve of this message.  And we went around the room so they could tag their spots.  I want that translated.  I'm not sure I approve of that message.  This is Anthony Cumia and I approve of this message.  I could have just been talking about the trains.  And then this came in from Beth H. 
[00:46:30]  Candidate Anthony Cumia wants you to think he's a regular guy.  But is he?  Do you shop on Rodeo Drive?  Anthony Cumia does.  Do you live in a mansion in Long Island?  Wow.  Anthony Cumia does.  Wow.  Do you drive a Shelby Mustang?  Well, guess what?  Anthony Cumia does.  Do you have mind-blowing sex with a girl half your age? 
[00:47:00]  That's right.  Anthony Cumia does.  Candidate Anthony Cumia.  What a lucky f***.  This is Anthony Cumia and I approve of this message.  The tag.  Wow.  Wait, is that an anti-you?  But he started off saying he wants you to think he's a regular guy.  See, it sounded so anti until the end.  Yeah, but then he realized, you know what?  This isn't a bad thing.  How come they're all about me?  That should have been an OB. 
[00:47:30]  This is OB.  Greg Hughes and I approve of that message.  I'm kind of happy.  They left me out of it, man.  But we all threw our tags out there.  Jimmy did.  Everybody.  But they're all about me.  They left me out of it.  Here's the last one we'll play for now.  Anti-Anthony.  This is from John in Hartford.  This is one of my favorites that came in.  Well, that ain't it.  No.  Anthony Cumia.  Hold on.  Hold on.  But that was another one against me.  Jesus.  Who'd hate me?  Before you head to the polls this November, Steve C. would like you to know a few things about 
[00:48:00]  his opponent, Anthony Cumia.  Did you know that Anthony Cumia doesn't like black people?  Well, in fact, he lives in one of the whitest neighborhoods in greater New York City.  And though he may be surrounded by Jews, it's a known fact that Anthony Cumia is a Nazi.  And during a recent skit on the Opie and Anthony program, Anthony played the part of Senator 
[00:48:30]  Mark Foley, KidToucher.  KidToucher, you decide.  Steve C. speaks with perfect enunciation and inflection.  Steve C. has never had a girlfriend placed in a loony bin.  Steve C. cares about the environment.  He drives a hybrid, not some flashy Mustang. 
[00:49:00]  Steve C. cares about the environment because he lives in the environment.  Grr.  Played for by the World Wildlife Fund, Steve Irwin, treasurer.  Steve C. That was a pro Steve C.  Yeah.  Anti-  Martini Steve?  Yeah.  Yeah.  All right.  Anti-me.  Anti-climatic.  The other ones were a lot better.  Actually, what was good was the music in the back.  You got to hear it.  Yeah.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  The ominous music when they talk about me.  And then it gets all nice. 
[00:49:30]  Yeah.  Right.  The patriotic.  But that's what they do in all these spots.  We got to step aside.  This show is going to move real fast.  We got Paul R. Nelson next.  We also have Borat coming in in about a half hour, I guess.  Nice.  Patrice O'Neill in for Jim Norton.  Jim in Atlanta all weekend long.  There you go.  There's all the info you need.  It's the ONA virus spreading across America.  I can walk on my hands.  I can fart and chew gum.  I play the ONA.  I can ride a unicycle.  I wear a bra and laced panties. 
[00:50:00]  So your talent is being queer, Travis?  It's the O.P. and Anthony Walkover Talent Show.  If you have a unique skill, talent, music group, or physical affliction, we want to exploit.  You can email steve at foundrymusic.com with your ideas,  or you can just show up during the walk to XM and start shucking and jiving.  Shucking and jiving?  Jesus, Danny.  I don't write this sh**.  It's the O.P. and Anthony Show.  The virus is spreading.  O.P. and Anthony! 
[00:50:30]  Here, checking out the O.P. and Anthony Show.  The ONA virus spreading across America.  Borat stopping by to say hi in about, looks like about 20 minutes, 25 minutes.  Paul R. Nelson calling in in about a minute or two here.  Oh, very exciting.  Hey, are the pests awake?  Are the ONA pests awake?  They should be.  I see quite a few of them on PalTalk.  All right, that's good to know.  Phil Mushnick.  Phil Mushnick.  Phil Mushnick.  Phil.  Phil Mushnick. 
[00:51:00]  Phil Mushnick.  Ned.  Ned Ryerson.  He's a sports writer, I guess.  In the New York Post.  He's a sports complainer.  He's not even a writer.  He just bitches about everything.  You know what?  We like to bring the whole country into our discussions.  I have no doubt every paper in America has a Phil Mushnick.  This guy's in the sports section.  He writes a column.  And he does nothing but bitch and complain about people that are working for a living.  Yeah, here's the deal.  He writes a sports column.  So you would assume right off the bat he's got to be a fan of sports. 
[00:51:30]  But you read this column day in and day out, and you realize that maybe he's not into sports anymore, and he should go write about something else.  Yeah.  So today he takes a shot at us.  Yeah, he has a little problem with us.  Wednesday, he writes, during the Knicks opener, Madison Square Garden Network twice ambushed its audience with that Opie and Anthony radio show ad in which they tell a woman that it's not her dress that makes her look heavy, but her, and then he puts, expletive. 
[00:52:00]  Really?  Her expletive?  I'm thinking in my head it's got to be worse than ass.  I would have to go with the F word.  Right.  C.  Or maybe the C word.  Something awful, yeah.  Other than demonstrating that Opie and Anthony are vulgar, what's the rest of this message?  That they're cruel?  Brilliant.  The message is very simple.  It's tagged and tells you what the message is.  The message, jackass, is the fact that we can't do anything but radio. 
[00:52:30]  We're so stupid and single-minded and rude that we couldn't possibly hold down another job except for radio.  And we've even had trouble doing that over the course of the years.  That's the message, Phil.  Sorry we had to explain it to you.  Basically, that commercial shows that in the real world, we just stink.  Yeah, we're horrible.  The joke, Phil, is on us.  That we can't work. 
[00:53:00]  We can't operate as normal human beings in real life.  So we have to sit behind these microphones because it's the only place we can really function.  See, Phil?  God, when you've got to explain it to retards.  And while these two champs are so hip and happening, should we forget they eagerly threw in with Vince McMahon to host his NBC XFL pregame show?  Which was not only pure and predictable garbage but served as the warm-up act for history-making garbage. 
[00:53:30]  Well, Phil, yeah.  But you know something?  Well, he's always had a problem with Vince McMahon.  Yeah, he hates Vince.  He goes after Vince McMahon all the time.  Hates him.  Not as much lately, but he thinks, you know, that all those wrestling shows don't have a place in our society, don't have a place on TV.  And he was really jumping on them when they were at their peak.  Right, right.  You know, where a lot of people were watching and entertained by it.  We're embarrassed that we did the XFL because it didn't go anywhere.  That's the only reason we're embarrassed.  And let me tell you something. 
[00:54:00]  I got no embarrassment for it.  Somebody offered it.  We took a shot at something.  It's not like a Phil Mushnick ever takes any chances.  He's the kind of guy that will sit there and die at his desk at the New York Post after 50 years of just bitching about other people that are taking chances and working and doing things.  Just a miserable guy that has no business writing about sports at this point.  He doesn't like it.  He hates what sports has become.  So move on. 
[00:54:30]  Go find another hobby.  Perish the thought he'd take any chances or do anything.  Yeah, go do something new if you're not enjoying sports anymore.  We took a shot at it.  It was years ago.  It bombed.  Actually, I'm not even really that embarrassed.  It was NBC.  It was pretty exciting.  Let me say it.  It was cold.  Who am I kidding?  It was a career highlight for us.  It's Phil Mushnick.  Phil.  Shark Hunter.  Phil Mushnick.  You can't do much with Mushnick as a lesson.  No, just the name alone.  When he shakes your hand and goes, I'm Phil Mushnick.  Don't you just...  You want to go, ugh. 
[00:55:00]  Oh, I'm sorry.  You want to Purell your hand.  I guarantee when people work with him, people that go, hey, Mushy, or PM, he hates anything  that...  Mush.  Yo, Mush.  What do you got today, Mush?  Don't call me Mush.  It's Mushnick.  Why can't they just call me Nick?  Not the mush part.  You're Mushnick.  So what does a dude like that like?  See, that's what I always...  Like, what is...  We're reading his column, and he's just bashing everybody.  He doesn't like anything.  But what's he enjoy?  He has to be a...  He enjoys...  A game to the yang, you know what I mean? 
[00:55:30]  Well, I mean, obviously, he got into writing about sports because he enjoys sports, but  he enjoys old-school sports.  He enjoys, you know, underhand free throws.  He enjoys the two-hand set shot as far as basketball goes.  He enjoys football with leather helmets.  When the Celtics were all white.  Right.  Right.  Those little shorts.  He enjoys baseball when they were wearing baggy uniforms.  And ran in fast motion around the bases in black and white.  See, there's so many like Phil Mushnick out there in society. 
[00:56:00]  They can't grow with society.  You know, there's music critics that think it ended with the Stones.  But it ain't Phil Mushnick's fault, though.  Well, they move on, though.  It's the New York Post's fault that they don't get a more hipper columnist to write about today's sports.  That's all I'm going to say.  How can you blame Phil Mushnick for being Phil Mushnick?  He's being Phil Mushnick.  Look, no problem.  You know, I'm sure bashing it is part of the job, sure. 
[00:56:30]  But all I read is him bashing it.  I don't see an inkling of this guy actually enjoying watching sports.  So I say the ONA pest should email this guy and ask him if he's retarded because he didn't understand the Opie and Anthony TV commercial.  And we're not pissed off that he's trashing us.  Trust me.  We got print in the New York Post today.  He's playing right into our hands.  And it's printed in the Post.  You could get a hold of him.  It's Phil.Mushnick at New York.  NYPost.com.  Phil.Mushnick. 
[00:57:00]  M-U-S-H-N-I-C-K.  Phil with one L.  At NYPost.com.  Yeah.  Go ahead.  Because you're free to comment on any columnist's column.  So go ahead.  Yeah.  Have fun with Phil today, guys.  A quick little mission.  Have fun with him.  Have fun.  I don't want to lose our guest here that we have on the phone.  I am so honored.  Yeah.  Hey, Anthony, really fast because it might set up the next break.  Yes.  John Alberts from Long Island.  I have no idea what this means, so please give me more info. 
[00:57:30]  It says, all it says on the answer of feedback, that Super Bowl champ died yesterday in a car accident.  Some bitch ran a red light, just thought you'd like to know.  Punching out John.  What?  How about some more info?  Did we lose one of our guys last night?  That Super Bowl champ?  Is that the guy that came in and got stung on the ball back?  Oh, Super Bowl.  The mousetraps on the throttle.  Are you kidding me?  One of them died?  I'm starting to think that we might have lost the guy that won our Super Bowl competition. 
[00:58:00]  Was that the story?  Where was he from?  Maybe that's the story on TV.  Maybe that's the Northport story?  I don't know, but that's all John is writing so far.  It just starts in the middle of a sentence.  That Super Bowl champ died yesterday in a car accident.  Well, get more info on that, people.  We need more info on that.  But without further ado, let's say hi to Paul R. Nelson.  Hey, good morning.  Thanks for having me on your show, gentlemen.  Mr. Nelson, it's an honor to speak to you.  We've been keeping track of your campaign over the course of the past few weeks. 
[00:58:30]  And, yeah, it's an honor to talk to you.  You've been in a lot of controversy.  I've seen you on TV a lot about your ads against wrong kind.  That's correct.  And some of that credit has to go to your show.  When you guys picked up our ads and crashed our website, our phone started to ring off the hook.  I know for a fact that reporters working for the Washington Post and Tucker Carlson and others at MSNBC listen to the Opie and Anthony show. 
[00:59:00]  Yeah, absolutely.  And now what do you do for a living?  You're a real estate agent?  I'm a real estate agent and a hockey dad.  A hockey dad.  Now that's something we're a little confused about.  We know what soccer moms are, but what's a hockey dad?  A hockey dad.  He likes to knock his kid's teeth out.  I'm a kid to hockey every night.  Oh, you take your kid to hockey.  That's nice.  And you come off like a very wholesome guy, a very American, kind of American dream family. 
[00:59:30]  You know what that is.  What is that?  You know what an American dream is to a Negro.  You know how we are.  Well, Patrice O'Neal is here.  That's white people's words for, you know.  The R word with two quotes.  Sometimes Patrice gets a little out of hand, Mr. Nelson.  I don't pay any attention.  I just want to know, how do you feel about 300-pound Negroes sleeping with small white women?  He doesn't.  You know something. 
[01:00:00]  He's laughing.  Could we maybe get a few minutes of a Paul R. Nelson interview?  You don't think that that's a valid question?  What if I wanted to vote for Paul R. Nelson?  I'm a big black man.  I want to know if he minds, if I come to Wisconsin and deflower a couple of delicious blue-eyed devils.  Let's keep it simple.  Paul R. Nelson, are you a fan of the Negro?  I'm a fan of all people.  All people.  That's what Paul's been about.  How about those Mexicans that are sleeping and peeing in the spinach? 
[01:00:30]  Oh, okay.  Paul, what about immigration?  What's your stand on immigration and the situation we have with a lot of illegal aliens coming over the border?  Hey, we've been very clear on our positions in our ads that we're not a very nuanced campaign.  We try not to leave a lot of room for ambiguity.  I would be against illegal immigration.  Of course, wrong kind would be one that we want to sponsor amnesty for illegal immigrants.  So that's all we're pointing out. 
[01:01:00]  And people keep talking about our attack ads.  You will note in our ads that we do not go after Mr. Kind for personal financial malfeasance or marital infidelity.  We are simply pointing out his voting records.  These really are not attack ads.  They're really what the campaign is supposed to be about, telling the voters the difference between what the two candidates would vote.  I understand that, Mr. Nelson.  And believe me, I am a fan.  But let me play the devil's advocate here. 
[01:01:30]  Do you think that your ads kind of leave it a little vague as to where that money was going, really?  It kind of comes off like a wrong kind is taking the taxpayers' dollars and going to Vietnam and paying for hookers.  It kind of – it sounds a little worse than it really is because I think in actuality it was a bill based on a sex study all wrapped up into one.  And it kind of sounds like these are separate incidents in your ads. 
[01:02:00]  Right.  And, you know, but the language in this ad, and that's why we put the NIH grant numbers, the Toomey Amendment number.  I mean, we live in the information age.  People can go to our website at paulernelton.com, and they can look this stuff up.  This is part of the congressional record.  The words that we use in the sex studies ad are part of the congressional record.  It's actually really, really accurate, and I would certainly challenge it. 
[01:02:30]  So you think Ron Kahn is obsessed with the masturbation habits of old men?  No, I don't think he's obsessed, but I do think that he knew what he was voting for when he voted to fund that study.  Yeah.  Paul, you mind if I ask you a quick question?  Uh, Patrice O'Neal.  Just two, Patrice O'Neal here, just, black man.  Just two, just two man-to-man.  You don't think, just man-to-man, you don't think that hooking up electrodes to a woman's vagina and making her watch porno and see how she reacts to it is a little bit sexy? 
[01:03:00]  Just as a man?  I know you're running for Congress, but just as a dude chilling out with a beer, you don't find that to be hot?  The point that we're making, whether or not we think that may be an interesting story.  Yeah.  Wait, wait, wait.  That someone took the time to take an electrode.  All right, be careful, Patrice, because they're dumping out.  To take an electrode.  Did they dump out on me already?  Possibly.  I just want to help you out. 
[01:03:30]  Teenage girls, porn, and something attached.  And electrodes.  And electrodes.  Let's just keep it at that.  Everyone can figure it out.  Somebody took the time to do that as a study.  Yeah.  That doesn't get just a little bit of a, like, whoof.  Like, you don't have to wipe your brow a little bit.  A little sweat didn't drip down your face.  Just a little.  All right, listen, Opie and Anthony, I wanted to issue a public challenge on your radio show. 
[01:04:00]  Okay.  To have Mr. Wrong Kind actually come out from underneath his desk where he's curled up in the fetal position, sucking his thumb and asking for his sippy cup of milk and a blanket.  I want him to come out from underneath the desk.  And I want him to come on the Opie and Anthony show Monday morning, the day before the election.  Right.  And let's have the pests call in, and we'll have a debate on air.  God, you know, it's about the pests and everything.  Wouldn't that be great?  Why won't he face you?  Wrong Kind is scared to death of the things that we've been running, the ads that we've been running in this campaign. 
[01:04:30]  Because, as I mentioned, we have been running ads that accurately depict his votes.  And Mr. Kind, his values and his waste of taxpayer dollars are well outside of the realm of the voters here.  Speaking of which, we've got the brand new ad.  I don't know how we got it.  Wink, wink, nudge, nudge.  The Bruce and Bubba ad.  I love the Bruce and Bubba ad.  Well, we happen to think it's a moment of brilliance. 
[01:05:00]  You know, we have a lot of young people in this country that don't pay attention to politics because they think it's boring.  And we've put some things together that we think have made budgetary issues a little bit interesting.  And now we've put an ad together that we believe will make the gay marriage issue a little bit interesting to young people.  And I don't think that young people understand how much power they can have in an election.  Your listeners, they want to go on our website at paulrnelson.com, make a small contribution to our campaign. 
[01:05:30]  We are beating the political life out of wrong kind with these ads exposing the way he's old.  So you're not a fan of the fruits?  I'm not a fan of what?  No, fruity people.  Look, they can do anything that they want.  We're not putting any restrictions on people.  But you can't tear down our institutions, and the institution of marriage has served mankind pretty well since, as we point out.  I think straight couples have already destroyed that institution.  I mean, let's be honest.  That's a fair point, man.  I mean, what's the stat up to, like 60% to 70% of all marriages fail? 
[01:06:00]  That's a fair point, man.  I mean, we've already destroyed it, so.  All right, Opie, you man-man-loving, just take, you listen to Paul R. Nelson's ad, and you tell me if that sounds odd.  You can't say let them suffer like us, right, guys?  You tell me if that sounds like something you want this country running around with men, walking around with men holding hands and being married.  That's not me, Mr. Nelson.  They only want to get married for insurance reasons.  I agree with your platform. 
[01:06:30]  They would stay doing, because men don't want to get married.  What they just do is because they didn't get insurance.  Are you for anything like that, like some kind of legal, not a marriage, but some kind of joint partnership between gay gentlemen or women that they can then get benefits and health care together?  Well, listen, fellas, anyone can go to an attorney.  You can own property together.  You can put together joint agreements where you can visit each other in the hospital.  Certainly, people can live however they choose to live. 
[01:07:00]  A legal contract.  A legal agreement.  Right.  Some kind of contract.  But not in the eyes of God.  Well, however you, the legal definition of marriage has been a sacred contract between a man and a woman.  I just think it would be very destructive to our society to go ahead and do that.  And we can look to Western Europe, to Norway and Sweden and the Netherlands, places where they've done this, and it has certainly been destructive.  Paul, what if they're two really hot lesbians, though? 
[01:07:30]  You know, not the butchy kind, you know, but like lipstick lesbian.  Not the ones that are shown on the news when they get married.  Jesus.  That's what I'm saying.  It's like, isn't that more?  Paul, come on.  I love Paul R. Nelson.  Isn't that more for us?  Isn't that more?  Paul, you've got to lean a little bit for us.  I mean, all right, man on man.  All right, let's be honest.  We all understand that.  But lipstick lesbians, where's your stance on that and them getting married? 
[01:08:00]  We speak gay marriage.  We're gender neutral.  He's pretty, yeah, he's pretty straightforward with that one.  What's your stance on lesbians and electrodes?  Well, he's already stated.  How about Vietnamese lesbians with electrodes with old men watching?  That's something wrong kind wants money going to.  That's wrong kind.  Wrong kind.  Did you guys just sit in that room when you figured out that you could put a couple of letters at the beginning and end of his name and make it wrong? 
[01:08:30]  Did you guys just go, oh, my God, this is great.  And as we were sitting at the table discussing this, we realized we had destroyed the man's political future right there and then because...  How do the polls look, Paul?  Not looking good for Paul.  Yeah, we haven't taken a poll at this point.  He doesn't want to know why.  Paul, you've got to be honest here.  You know it's going to be really, really tough to win this election, right? 
[01:09:00]  No question.  Every incumbency is extremely strong.  Yeah.  That's why challengers have to come out and they have to make very articulate points and they have to tell the electorate why it is that you should fire the incumbent.  And I think we've been doing a fairly good job of pointing out some of those reasons.  Hey, Paul, I think I can help you out.  Yeah.  Okay.  I got pics.  I got some pictures you might want to see.  What?  You got wrong kind there?  I might have some pictures. 
[01:09:30]  What have you got?  Don't believe him.  Look how excited.  You can tell how excited Paul R. Nelson is.  I call him wrong P.  Wrong P.  He's wrong O. P.  What about abortion, sir?  Where are we at?  Hey, come on.  You guys have listened to the commercial.  I'm a pro-life candidate.  Yep.  Four children, one on the way.  So we're –  Wow.  I'm a big supporter of children.  Yeah, he's – you're pretty much right down the line, Republican, conservative. 
[01:10:00]  That's probably a fair statement.  Yeah, fair statement.  How about taking it out from time to time, Paul?  You're like a – you're like Sean Kemp.  Paul, I got to be honest.  I once held hands with a man at a Mets game.  Yeah, I have too.  My dad.  Aw, that's sweet.  What?  His dad.  What about him?  He held hands with a –  Oh, no, no.  This was just another man.  Who?  That I wasn't related to.  This is something I've never heard of, Paul.  Oh, no.  I've –  I could see it now.  The Paul R. Nelson and Anthony show.  I don't want any part of this Opie holding hands with him. 
[01:10:30]  I told the story on the air.  Where are you at with me, Opie, holding another man's hand that I wasn't related to at a Mets game?  Opie, I'm fine with that.  I'm fine with you doing anything you want with another man short of getting married, Opie.  There you go.  It was our own Danny, and I didn't know.  I thought I was holding my girlfriend's hand, and they did the old switcheroo, and I walked out of Shea Stadium holding another man's hand.  It's a true story.  So, Paul, just to get to know a little bit more about you, aside from politics, what are the things you find funny? 
[01:11:00]  Like, where does your sense of humor lie?  I sell real estate, so I work with people.  I enjoy laughing.  I try and laugh at work.  I find everyday life things humorous.  I enjoy Bill Cosby's humor.  I enjoy Jeff Foxworthy.  You might be a redneck.  Well, it's the Midwest.  You're losing us, Paul.  You're losing us.  He's a Midwest guy.  He's a Midwest guy.  You might be a politician if... 
[01:11:30]  Can I buy a house in Wisconsin?  Yeah, what's the real estate market looking like in Wisconsin?  The real estate market in Wisconsin is a little slow right now.  Yeah, everything, right?  That damn bubble burst right after I bought it.  It ain't slow for you, Anthony.  Yeah.  So when you lose the election, you're going back to real estate, or...?  When I lose the election, I'm not planning to lose the election.  He's not planning on losing it.  And I want to know...  I am throwing my hat in the Paul R. Nelson ring, and I want everybody else that's listening  right now in Wisconsin to vote for Paul R. Nelson. 
[01:12:00]  Whoa, whoa, whoa.  Why?  Because I like this guy.  That's it?  That's all it takes?  Yeah.  I like his gusto.  He's got gusto.  We might not agree, Paul, on all of the issues, because it's very hard for everybody to agree  on every issue that a politician has.  But I kind of like this guy.  He's got spunk.  The fact that he doesn't like Italians doesn't mean anything to you.  I don't know about Italians.  We don't discuss things like that.  And I don't think Paul R. Nelson has...  He doesn't. 
[01:12:30]  He judges people as people, not as colors or...  You are illegal immigrants.  You know, you got...  Excuse me?  Italians are illegal immigrants.  My family came here so long ago.  You snuck here, and you probably named after a town where your great-great-grandfather grew  up, Cumiaville.  And you came here, and you destroyed our lives with your mobsters and your spaghetti sauce.  I want you out.  I want to know how you'd live in buildings with bricks stacked up with no cement holding  them together, my friend.  If it wasn't for my relatives, so you quiet down, Patrice. 
[01:13:00]  Paul, I'm still on the fence.  I'm not sure if I want to vote for you.  I don't know.  I got to know...  I'm being honest.  I got another scenario for you.  All right.  Let me tip you over here.  All right.  Here's what the main qualification of a candidate should be to the American people.  All right.  That is that the American people know unequivocally where the candidates stand on the issues.  You may not agree with Paul R. Nelson, but you will always know where Paul R. Nelson stands  on the issues.  That should be the primary qualification for any candidate running for public office. 
[01:13:30]  And I submit to you that most candidates do their hardest job of trying to obfuscate  the issues and confuse the American people as to where they stand.  All right.  I got one more scenario.  And how you answer this question, we'll decide if I vote for you.  Okay?  Oh, boy.  Let's just say there's a guy from Long Island who went to college in Geneseo at a state  school, and he was very lonely. 
[01:14:00]  He was 400 miles away from home, and he wanted to join a fraternity to get some friends and  a social life.  And let's just say this fraternity made him drop his draws and pick up marshmallows and  then maybe waddle across the floor and drop the marshmallows on something that represented  maybe another fraternity that they hated.  And he wasn't using his hands at the time, right?  And he wasn't using his hands.  Where do you stand on that?  As long as he's not marrying the marshmallows, I'm okay with that. 
[01:14:30]  Okay.  See?  I vote for Paul R. Nelson.  Paul R. Nelson.  And Paul, if we may, this is a very good question that Patrice brought up.  What does the R stand for?  Raymond.  Paul Raymond Nelson.  Hey, Paul, did you hear our Megamix yet?  I have not.  Oh, you know what?  We have heard your Megamix.  And you know, I wanted to thank you guys for that.  You know, we noticed in our campaign office, by the way, we've listened to almost every  show where you've been talking about us, and my campaign staff laughs until they cry.  Oh, good. 
[01:15:00]  Yeah, we're really funny.  You are.  I've become a big fan.  But I've noticed over the days that you have become more of a fan as you've explored our  issues.  Actually, we started by hating you because of the negative ads, but then we're like, man,  there's a sense of humor in these ads, and then we, yeah, you completely turn us around.  And I don't even know if we agree on anything.  Not there.  Like I said, there are a few issues I agree with, a few I don't agree with, but you do,  like he said, you do know what he stands for, and I don't know what this wrong kind is 
[01:15:30]  all about, except he's kind of hiding.  That's what I see.  He is absolutely hiding.  I think your pests need to get him out from underneath his desk and motivate him to pick  up the telephone and call the Opium Anthem show, and so that we can have a debate on air  on the Opium Anthem show.  All right.  Paul, any problem with somebody maybe collecting World War II memorabilia?  Because I do that.  Oh, not a problem.  I sold a house recently for a fellow that had his whole house full of World War II memorabilia. 
[01:16:00]  Can we be specific here and say Nazi?  No, it's from all sides.  I have a British Enfield rifle.  Time out.  Gun control, Paul.  Conservative Republican.  I'm all for guns.  All right.  I love this guy.  See?  How about black men with guns?  Legally.  I'm all about guns.  If they're legally obtained.  How about nines, nigger?  Yeah, we got it.  We got it.  We got to go.  Paul, thank you so much for checking in with us, and good luck on the election. 
[01:16:30]  And Pest, help out Paul R. Nelson.  Paul R.  Thank you, gentlemen.  Thank you.  All right.  There he goes.  Peace out.  Paul R. Nelson, everybody.  This is Paul R. Nelson, and you're listening to the Opie and Anthony show.  All right.  That's Paul R. Nelson.  I can't believe you talked to him.  He's like a celebrity.  I love Paul R. Nelson.  He's just a dumb real estate guy from Wisconsin.  He's a real estate guy.  But he's a celebrity now.  He's a celebrity. 
[01:17:00]  All right.  We got a break because we got Borat coming in.  It's the O and A virus spreading across America.  Opie, Anthony, Jim Norton, and the comedians of the Opie and Anthony show are appearing in  a special holiday edition of FHM on sale now.  It's the Opie and Anthony show.  It's Last Pet Standing.  Recorded live at FH Riley, hosted by Opie's brother Elmo, and featuring some of the least  funny Opie and Anthony fans telling some of the most unamusing jokes.  It's awful. 
[01:17:30]  Kiss that insomnia goodbye.  It's an evening of performances by people whose parents think they're really hysterical.  And that's it.  The unfunny begins this Saturday, November 4th at 9 p.m.  Only on XM 202.  It's Last Pet Standing.  Opie, Anthony, Jim Norton, and the comedians of the Opie and Anthony show are appearing  in a special holiday edition of FHM on sale now.  Hey, you're checking out the Opie and Anthony show. 
[01:18:00]  We got a break already.  It's the ONA virus spreading across America.  We're so late today.  But we got our exclusive interview with Paul R. Nelson. 
[01:18:30]  Yes.  Well, the guys, I see them all over TV now.  And he's crediting us for that.  Yeah.  That's pretty cool.  A lot of the people behind the scenes there at MSNBC and a lot of the news stations listened  to this show and kind of got wind of his ads and things and wanted to have them on.  I got a communique from Elo.  Yeah.  He just writes, this is huge. 
[01:19:00]  I don't know if it's huge.  It's huge for the Opie and Anthony show.  Oh, Paul R. Nelson.  We've been talking about it for, what, 10 days or so?  It's amazing how you can build somebody up into this big celebrity in your head.  I was intimidated talking to Paul R. Nelson.  Speaking of big celebrities.  Yes.  Borat is here.  Borat.  Where is Borat?  The new movie opens today.  We're right outside.  Pardon me?  They're going to get him in in a second. 
[01:19:30]  The movie opens today.  I can't even, you know, the movie's called Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit  Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan.  But it's getting massive reviews.  New York Papers giving it four stars.  All of them giving it four stars in the New York Papers, I guess.  RottenTomatoes.com, 95% good review.  Good review.  I talk like him now.  Good review.  Who's the idiots that didn't give it a good review?  Who are the people that didn't get it? 
[01:20:00]  Just some dope, too cool for the room, saying he's ripping off Andy Kaufman.  Phil Mushnick.  All right.  I was answering your question.  Oh, but you two speak amongst yourselves.  Who cares?  Whatever.  Talk amongst yourselves.  No, one ass saying that he's doing a cheap Andy Kaufman, which I completely.  Disagree with, by the way.  The guy's just a dope.  He's just too cool for the room.  He has to be the one.  Like, look what I.  Look, I'll be the one that writes the naked review on the movie.  Ah!  Bone ring it.  What? 
[01:20:30]  What happened?  What happened?  Huh?  How about Linda Stassi?  Did she give it a bad review?  I don't know.  She doesn't do movie reviews, so.  No?  Well, hey.  That was the big intro for Borat.  What's going on?  We can't do a better job than that.  Maybe he busy.  He's in bathroom?  He's in bathroom.  Be right back.  He's in bathroom.  Be right back.  Maybe he decided not to do our show.  Maybe he got some last minute info on us.  He was offended that Paul R. Nelson was a guest before him. 
[01:21:00]  Hey, we can take a break and completely catch up and then get into Borat.  Oh, wow.  I don't know.  What do you think?  Where is he?  Is he taking a, you know what?  A duck?  Is he panicking on us?  No.  What's happening?  I can't panic.  Hey, Borat.  We're on in the bathroom, so.  Are we?  Borat.  What are our numbers in the bathroom?  How's it coming out?  Doing good?  Two out of three stalls love us. 
[01:21:30]  All right.  That's good.  We're up.  We're up a bit.  I don't know what to do.  Is he coming down the hall?  Oh, my God.  If we break, we can be back on track.  Should we do that?  He's going to have to wait like seven minutes.  All right.  Let him dump.  All right.  Let him dump.  Let him dump.  I don't think anyone's going anywhere.  Then jump right now.  Make the decision.  Make the call.  This is a big guess for us.  We went long with Paul R. Nelson.  We're taking another break.  Make the call.  All right.  It's the ONA virus spreading across America. 
[01:22:00]  Hear what everyone else is talking about.  ONA Uncut and Live continuing the show on XM Satellite Radio starting at 9 a.m. Eastern.  Visit XMRadio.com to subscribe.  It's the Opie and Anthony show.  All right.  Let's try this again.  Take two.  It's the Opie and Anthony show.  The ONA virus spreading across America.  Ladies and gentlemen, Borat.  There he is.  All right.  Hello, sir. 
[01:22:30]  How are you?  Oh, no.  Oh, Anthony doesn't like that.  Anthony doesn't like the kisses on the cheek.  Well, yeah, it's customary in his country.  I'll just go for a head shake.  I'll just go for a head shake.  No, he's got it.  It's customary.  All right.  You would be insulting him.  Very nice.  Now you got to put some Purell on your cheeks, dude.  I could.  I could.  Oh, feel free to sit right here on this beautiful red couch.  Yeah.  Well, we tried to get Borat in about 15 minutes ago, but at the last minute, he had to go to the bathroom. 
[01:23:00]  Yes, I needed, I had a problem with my anus.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Last night, I'm very excited.  I go to your nice restaurant, McDonald's.  Yeah.  And I eat a 14 hamburger and 2,000 packets of this red soup that's called ketchup.  And now this morning, after what just happened, my anus, it hanged loose like a mouth of a tired dog. 
[01:23:30]  Yeah.  So you don't have fast food restaurants in your hometown there?  We do not have so much.  There are stalls on the road that maybe sell some fermented horse urine or horse's throat that have been boiled.  But not so much this wonderful, humble guy.  I am bringing back three so that my premier can eat it on the opening of parliament dinner. 
[01:24:00]  And what do you think of the American toilet?  It's nice, right?  Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, very nice.  I make my toilet in this room.  And in the corner, there is a bowl on the floor with water in it, which is very convenient to wash your face with after.  Yeah.  Whatever you can use it for.  Yeah, the water in the bowl.  Yeah, it's very nice. 
[01:24:30]  Very nice.  Very nice.  You're very nice, Pippos.  People are loving you.  I like America, USA.  Yeah, you like?  You know we're shock jocks.  What a minute, shock jock.  Have you heard of shock jocks in your country?  What a minute, shock jocks, shock jocks.  What a minute, shock jocks, shock jocks.  They say outrageous.  We do shocking things.  Oh, outrageous.  Hi.  Crazy things. 
[01:25:00]  Yeah.  What, you shoot gypsies live?  No.  We have a show like this in Kazakhstan.  Yeah?  Yes.  What's the entertainment like over there?  Gypsy shooting?  Very nice.  Our number one show is hosted by animal actor Johnny the Monkey, who was the star of Transibirsk  Express and hundreds of other pornos.  Pornos, huh?  Yeah.  Great.  Great.  Well, people are loving your movie, your documentary. 
[01:25:30]  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  People are loving it, except I'm hearing maybe the governments in your country aren't very  happy about it.  There have been some controversies in my country of Kazakhstan about the amount of anti-Semitism  in my movie film.  However, eventually, the Kazakh censor allowed the film to be released after deciding that  there was just enough.  You know, I'm a little confused by the name, though.  Couldn't you come up with something a little shorter there? 
[01:26:00]  A Borat Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan.  Right, right, right.  This is the abridged title.  It doesn't.  Oh, it is.  It doesn't flow off the tongue, sir.  Why not?  I think it does.  Did you think?  Yeah.  What do you think we should call it?  That's a good question.  I wish I had an answer.  I would look brilliant at this point.  Borat Informative Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan.  Exactly.  There you go.  Good name, too. 
[01:26:30]  How do you explain on the beach that a bathing suit that you had on?  Yes.  When I was in the Cannes Film Festival, I wear a bathing suit.  Very nice.  Very nice.  It is the official Olympic swimming suit of Kazakhstan.  Oh, it is?  Okay.  That's where it fit in.  You must have a good crumb to wear it.  You have a nice crumb?  Yeah, I've been told.  It's been okay.  Yeah, it's not fair.  We say to be a good interviewer, you must have a good crumb. 
[01:27:00]  Good crumb.  Crumb.  You have a nice one?  Yeah, I think it's okay.  Can I touch it?  I'm Italian.  Oh, no, that's okay.  Why not?  Well, I kind of like girls to touch that, not men.  Yeah.  Yeah.  You're a man.  No, I touch it.  No, you're a man.  What the problem?  Because you're a man.  But I am not the man who makes a bang, bang, bang in annals of other men.  Oh, no, no.  No, I have made a sexy time with three women and 15 prostitutes. 
[01:27:30]  Yeah, but it sounds like you want to go to the edge of the forest with Anthony, though.  No, I do not like to make...  You want to go to the edge of the forest, right?  I do not like to fill annals with goose liver so there's no tearing.  No, okay.  So there's no tearing.  Goose liver.  Is that what's used?  Why not?  Why not?  Because it's very slippery, I guess.  No, in my country, now homosexuals treated equally, they no longer have to wear blue hats. 
[01:28:00]  Are they allowed to get married?  What?  Are they allowed to get married?  Why would they get married?  Well, it's the big fad here in America.  They do not want to get married.  Last year we had very many of them.  We found 15 of them.  Yeah.  But after we cage them and give them electric therapy, we cure them.  I like how you think, sir.  Now, what's the problem with the Jews in your country? 
[01:28:30]  The Jews.  We would like to say that we in Kazakhstan very much support anti-Jew warrior Melvin Gibson  in his statement about the Jews.  He say that they start all the wars.  We also have proof from our government scientists that it was the Jews that were responsible  for the end of the dinosaur period. 
[01:29:00]  Your scientists have come up with that one.  Yes, Dr. Yamak.  Dr. Yamak.  Just one scientist?  Yes, Dr. Yamak, you have one scientist.  He also proved that a woman's brain is the size of a squirrel.  So, yeah, again, a lot of women are coming out and saying that, look at this man, he  is a big.  Do you have, hey, do you have that color in your country?  We have a one man like this. 
[01:29:30]  He work in a circus.  People pay 25,000 tenge to touch his hair.  He's called Gogol.  You know him?  Don't I look like Kazakhstani women?  You are not the woman's.  You are a big man.  Yes, sir.  I would like to wrestle you with no clothes.  I wish I had the cram that I should have been blessed with. 
[01:30:00]  Oh, you don't have a big cram?  Oh, I wanted a baby on, but I didn't get blessed with a big cram.  Yes.  Mine is thick like a can of Pepsi.  A lot of women have been talking about your film and saying that it doesn't show them  in the best light.  Thank you very much.  It is not a problem.  They are not allowed in the cinema.  No.  Not where I'm from.  We have a pen outside the cinema where you put your animals and your wives, and you must 
[01:30:30]  give in a ticket stop to collect them.  If they are not collected within three days, then they are resold.  That's a great idea.  I like that.  Obviously, they don't vote yet over there or anything, right?  What?  No voting.  Let's sizzle out.  We say to give a woman vote is like to let a monkey fly a plane. 
[01:31:00]  Very dangerous.  We stopped letting monkeys do that ever since the Astana air crash of 2002.  We all heard about that.  That was a sad day.  Tragic.  Yeah, yeah.  Yes.  Yes, he is a big black man.  He wants to wrestle you naked, Patrice.  He wants to wrestle you naked.  I don't care.  He wrestles people naked.  All right.  I'll wrestle them naked.  How much is a Kazakhstani dollar, or whatever you call it, compared to American dollar? 
[01:31:30]  Our conversion rate is one U.S. dollar is about 250,000 Kazakh tenge.  Now, what does one Kazakh tenge buy you?  It buys you a woman's.  There's a lot of prostitution over there.  Yeah.  So, my sister, in fact, is the number four prostitute in all of Kazakhstan. 
[01:32:00]  I read that.  Congratulations.  This morning, yeah.  Yes.  The family must be proud.  We are.  Particularly since last month, she received an award from the Minister of Industry for best mouth party.  Mouth party.  Wait a minute.  So, one American dollar can get me 250,000 Kazakhstani prostitutes?  If you could find that many, I guess.  Yeah.  Wow.  He likes the prostitutes.  Well, I mean, not the.  Yeah. 
[01:32:30]  I don't like the prostitutes.  I'm talking like he does.  That's all.  You must come stay in my house.  You can eat my food.  You can sleep in my house.  And you can use my sister.  She is tight, like a Manzanos.  And he likes to swing a little bit.  You know.  He likes to.  He likes to swing.  Like Tarzan.  Like Tarzan.  Even he knows.  I thought you were going to say it like a gorilla, but he was like, oops. 
[01:33:00]  He even, no, he had reached there.  Did he get Flavor Love out in Kazakhstan on television?  What?  No.  No.  He doesn't know what that is.  Of course not.  When do you have to go back?  Do you have like a visa or something?  Yes.  I must return soon.  I stay in New York for a few more days.  And then I go, return, I will arrive back in Kazakhstan maybe in three months. 
[01:33:30]  We travel.  Yes.  How do you travel?  It must take two.  Yes.  We go a boat.  And then my son, Bilak, who is 11 years old, and his wife is waiting for me.  They have a new child who we are hoping to sell to Madonna.  Yeah.  That's pretty impressive.  Did you ever think of living here?  It's a very nice country, but I like very much Kazakhstan.  It's a very similar place to America now. 
[01:34:00]  Really similar.  Yes.  We treat people equally.  We have opened in May the Almaty Disabled Care Center.  Oh, that's nice.  Yes.  It's very nice.  We have 300 new cages for them to live in.  That sounds like a great industry.  Yeah.  Your country is the making of cages.  Yes.  There's a lot of cage stuff happening.  It's like the cage welder must do very well over there.  Yeah.  I'm sure that keeps crime down.  Yeah.  Keeping a lot of people in cages, right?  Yeah. 
[01:34:30]  Yeah.  Well, we should talk about the movie.  For the people that don't know, you can explain your movie to everybody.  It's getting great reviews.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  You don't even have to be here, so we appreciate this.  Four stars in all of the newspapers.  Four stars is good?  Four stars is very good.  So the American government give it four stars?  Well, no.  We have, like, newspapers that's separate from the government.  We're supposed to.  What?  Yeah.  Different guys have different opinions.  Yeah. 
[01:35:00]  What does Premier George Walter Bush think?  We are very big fanies of him.  Oh, you like him.  Although he is strong, although not as strong as his father, Barbara.  Tough guy, Barbara.  My name is Barbara.  Don't mess with me.  Who's in charge over there in Kazakhstan?  Premier Nazarbayev.  Glorious.  Glorious.  Glorious.  He is a glorious leader.  And he takes care of his people.  Very much.  He is a very wise and very strong man. 
[01:35:30]  He, in your country, you win the vote.  You win the one with most votes wins.  Right.  In my country, it is the one who can suspend the heaviest weight from his crumb.  He managed the car battery for 3.4 seconds.  That's impressive.  Yeah.  Are you guys fighting anybody right now?  Yes.  We are defending ourselves from evil nitwits Uzbekistan, who are our neighbors.  Oh. 
[01:36:00]  Oh, yeah?  Oh, you best.  Oh, right, right, right.  Yes, it's a very bad people.  You were all the former Russians, right?  All the former Soviet Union.  Yeah, that's before 1991.  Yeah, yeah.  They were all communists.  Under communists.  That's a bunch of countries we can't pronounce.  Yeah.  That's all I know.  Explain the movie, though, there, Borat.  You went around America?  The movie films show how I come to America to make reportings for my country, and then  I fall in love with a beautiful woman and must go find her. 
[01:36:30]  Ah.  Her name is Pamela Anderson.  Yeah?  Yes.  Got a crush on her?  Yeah.  You going to bring her home with you?  I did not crush her, no.  No?  No.  No crushing her.  You like the...  In my country, you American women, you like to have their teat, yes?  Yes.  They're very up.  Yeah.  In Kazakhstan, we like it to dangle.  Oh, really?  Our women, to make themselves look more pretty, they hang rocks from them. 
[01:37:00]  In fact, Kazakhstan, Miss Kazakhstan, Karil Gashatmova, she have a beautiful pair that make dangle  1.3 meter.  Wow.  1.4 if you include the milk valve.  And that's attractive.  When she's bending over, it looks like she has four legs.  Yeah.  That's very attractive.  Very nice.  So, traveling across America, what did you learn about America as you were filming this  movie? 
[01:37:30]  I learned many things, democracy, how it etiquettes your people, but I also learned some things  that surprised me.  For example, that it is now illegal to shoot at Red Indians.  Yeah.  And can I please use this opportunity to once again apologize to the staff at the Potawatomi  Casino in Nevada?  There was an ugly scene up there.  There were no signs.  No signs.  Well.  Yeah, because a lot of people, I guess, from your country would think that we could still 
[01:38:00]  do that.  Yeah.  You know, shoot Indians.  Shoot Indians.  Yeah.  A lot of things have changed.  I don't know how much of our history.  It is a shame.  It is a shame.  It is a shame.  I don't know how much of our history you're familiar with, and when it happened, and how long  ago, but that was a while ago.  Do they get along with the other kind of Indians, the dot Indians?  What, people from India?  Kazakhstan, yeah.  Yeah.  What?  The other Indians.  The dot Indians?  The dot Indians.  What are the dot Indians?  Well, there's the red ones at the casinos, and then there's the dot ones that were even 
[01:38:30]  staked for Arabs.  Yes.  What?  The ones that look like black people with white people hair.  I, uh, you're hungry.  I, uh, you're hungry.  I, uh.  Whoa, whoa, whoa.  Whoa, whoa, whoa.  Now, you, you, you are a fat.  Whoa.  Whoa, Borat.  I like.  Very nice.  Everyone's just having fun here.  What the hell?  I'm messing with my self-esteem.  I just asked about dot Indians. 
[01:39:00]  Women's would go crazy for you in Kazakhstan.  They like it very much, a fat.  Would they let me get on top in Kazakhstan, or is it, what's the, what's the, what's the  Yeah, what's the position?  The known position, the best position.  The most famous position in Kazakhstan is called, uh, the dog style.  Ah, right.  That's where the man stand up, like this.  Oh, yeah.  And the dog stand like this.  You ever tried this? 
[01:39:30]  No, no, never tried that one.  No, Sam.  Now, the, uh, you say you, you fall in love with a woman, and you try to find her.  What, what is the, uh, difference?  Like, uh, it seems like in your country, uh, you don't treat women that well, and like you  said before.  What?  Well, you, you treat them differently than here.  How do American women react to the way, uh, you, you treat them?  Uh, I do not know.  I mean, I have not had time to buy any here.  Yeah.  Okay.  Uh, but, uh, I did not ask them. 
[01:40:00]  No.  Yeah.  No, you just kind of fell in love.  Some of them, when I'm walking in the streets, and I ask them how much, they get angry.  Yeah, that'll happen.  Yeah.  By the way, they're not all prostitutes.  A lot of people on the-  What?  A lot of people on the Instant Feedback want us to tell Borat that he's not our slave.  He, he's, he's an equal here.  Oh, man.  I don't remember any, I don't remember Borat saying anything about having slaves in Kazakhstan.  Well, you know.  And if they were slaves, they're not black American dudes. 
[01:40:30]  We're trying to educate them.  He's a-  I have a slave.  What are the lower class citizens in Kazakhstan?  I have a slave, his name is Bishkek, he is, uh, Uzbekistani, but he liked to be chained.  Oh, he does?  Okay.  Yes.  Then it's okay.  The gypsies once broke into my house and they, uh, touched Bishkek in a bad way.  He became depressed.  Yeah.  Well, uh, Borat has to go do some TV.  Yeah.  Are you enjoying the TV?  What?  Are you enjoying doing American TV? 
[01:41:00]  Very much.  Yeah.  I meet, uh, I went on this show Letterman's.  Yeah.  And, uh, I, uh, on stage with this, uh, pop star Beck.  Ah.  Beck, yeah.  Yeah.  Very pretty girl.  By the way, you shaved the mustache, you look like that guy from, uh, Talladega Nights.  What?  Yeah, the gay guy.  The gay Formula One driver.  Are you related to him?  I am not a gay.  You just go to the edges of the forest every once in a while.  I do not go to the edge of the forest. 
[01:41:30]  I have never made a romance inside another man.  You know, that mustache.  Maybe once on the Feast of Shurik, but this is an obligation.  That mustache in America kind of, you know, means something a little different.  In, uh, my country, if you do not have a mustache, it means you are a lolly lolly.  It does.  Yes.  All right.  Well, this is going to be really awkward because he's got to go to do TV.  Do you take, uh, photographs?  Yes.  Can we get a quick photograph? 
[01:42:00]  I like to take photographs of ladies making toilets.  Hey, we're going to get along.  All right.  He's got to go.  Borat's got to go.  Yeah, he's very busy.  I want to take you back to Kazakhstan.  I will make a lot of money.  Selling him to the circus.  No, not selling him to the circus.  No, no, no.  Come with me.  He wants to take you.  He will like you.  Well, you got to give me a context. 
[01:42:30]  Well, to touch your hair, I would think.  See what you says to do in the circus work?  Borat, you get him a part in your next movie, he'll go.  Okay.  He'll go with you.  Very nice.  But please, I ask people to come see my movie film because my government has told me if it's  not a success, I will be executed.  By the way, we'll never see him again, unfortunately.  So enjoy your career.  We get you guys just before you make it.  And then we get you when you're way down at the other side.  How many Kazachstani ooplies are you getting paid for? 
[01:43:00]  Oh, boy.  This movie.  This movie.  Yeah.  This movie.  How many prostitutes?  Put it this way.  How many prostitutes can you buy from this movie?  Well, I tell you, it have made a lot of money in Kazakhstan.  It took the number one spot from Hollywood movie King Kong, which has been the number one  film in my country ever since it was released in 1933.  I'm not saying a word. 
[01:43:30]  We don't need to say anything.  Yeah.  Wonderful.  Well, you're a joy to have here.  It's very nice to be with your peoples.  Yes.  Can we go later on, make a party in my hotel room, drink vodka, wrestle no clothes, and  shoot dogs from windows?  We certainly could.  I would love that.  Sounds like a party.  Sounds like an afternoon.  Yeah.  Hey, the name of the movie again, sir, because I can't do it. 
[01:44:00]  It just doesn't flow.  It is Borat Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit, the Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan.  Of course it is, Opie.  It's Borat, everyone.  Thank you very much.  Thank you so much, Laura.  I love you.  You're wonderful.  I like sex.  All right.  We'll take a quick break and we'll continue.  It's the ONA virus spreading across America.  Opie, Anthony, Jim Norton, and the comedians of the Opie and Anthony Show are appearing  in a special holiday edition of FHM on sale now. 
[01:44:30]  It's the Opie and Anthony Show.  Mm-hmm.  Oh, my God.  That was a lot of fun.  It's the Opie and Anthony Show.  The ONA virus spreading across America.  Borat.  Borat.  Best guest ever.  God damn.  No, it's weird.  A lot of listeners, before he came in, they were trying to talk me into, like, trying  to get him out of character.  Yeah. 
[01:45:00]  I guess that would have been a good gag, I guess.  But that was just way too much fun to just go with it.  The character he does is so friggin' funny.  I mean, why?  Yeah.  Yeah.  And you could see him out of character.  I'm sure we'll get him out of character at some point.  I tried a little bit because, uh, did you see Talladega Nights?  Yeah, he's in that.  Did you see the movie, though?  No.  No.  The movie's, you know, it's okay.  It could have been a lot better.  The concept was great with Will Ferrell and all.  Yeah.  But, uh, what's his real name?  Sasha? 
[01:45:30]  Cohen?  Right?  He plays a gay Formula One driver.  Just beyond hilarious.  Yeah.  Beyond hilarious in the movie.  Guy's blowing up, dude.  We'll never see him again.  That guy's gonna be huge.  This movie is just getting the best reviews.  Unbelievable.  We'll never see him again.  The character is such a goof.  Oh.  You know, I was telling Patrice, too.  I'm like, you know, usually when guys play characters, I'm like, ugh.  Stop already.  I think Tim Norton's the same way. 
[01:46:00]  But he just pulls it off so well.  Like, no, I knew he was pulling it off really well when Patrice was going with it, for the  most part.  Because I thought out of the three of us, you know, even though people were asking me  to go with it, you know, to try to break them, I was thinking the whole time when Borat,  Sasha, whatever, came in, that Patrice would finally go, all right, dude, stop.  Stop.  We all know that you're, we all know you're British, you're Ali G, you know, stop. 
[01:46:30]  It was on, it was on the tip, but the dude, it's almost like when I was looking at him,  it's something connected there where it was almost like, he was like, oh, just come on.  Just go with it.  Would you just go with it?  And I'm like, you know, we both had eyes like, all right, I'm gonna do it.  I'll do it, man.  Because it was there, and I was just like, I wanted to just throw in some, just, come  on, Ali, chill out, man.  Yeah, Ali, what are you doing?  Come on, Sasha, stop playing, dude.  It brought me back to being a kid, because it was like, it was almost like a Santa Claus 
[01:47:00]  moment.  When Santa Claus shows up?  Well, I'll tell you why, because as soon as the interview was over, this is what we give  you guys, the behind the scenes stuff, as soon as we went to break, he pops out of the  chair, and he starts talking with his British accent, I'm like, oh, man.  You want to take a photo, Gruff?  Yeah, I kind of, wait, what the, I kind of wanted him, where did Borat go?  I kind of wanted him to leave his Borat.  Like, if the little kid in me was like, just play it all the way through, and walk out  his Borat.  No, but that made me like him.  That made me like him more, that made me like him more, like, you know, because it's 
[01:47:30]  like, if he had got up and been like, ah, goodbye, yeah, we'd take photographs, photograph.  Yeah, but he's like, and then he's like, thanks, and then he's like, and then he goes,  sorry, you know, in the British accent, I can't do it.  He's like, sorry, just, you know, I really had to take a, and then he said the S word  for, you know what?  And he took me right out of it.  I was like, man, I was, I was being a kid there, bro.  You're a Borat.  You're a Borat.  I want to believe.  You know, it's really weird.  He puts on the, well, he goes back to his regular voice with the English accent, and 
[01:48:00]  his body mannerisms and facial expression changes.  Yeah.  And all of a sudden, he's like, even though he's got that dopey mustache, he's like a  smooth, cool guy.  And two seconds ago, he had that dopey face on with the thumbs up thing going.  It's like in a split second, he changes, and he's kind of like smooth.  Yeah.  The English, you know how the English are.  I got to tell you, the X-Hammers got the, got the good interview.  They dumped out a bunch.  I'm starting to hear now. 
[01:48:30]  Oh, well, any reference to female parts that you can't talk about on the radio, he was  using certain descriptions of them that were really funny.  But, yeah, well, that's the, you know, hey, sorry, it's the price you pay for FCC-regulated  free radio.  That's why it's free.  Wow.  What can we tell you, people?  Yeah, wow.  That's how it is.  I'm hearing seven dumps during that segment.  Before you came in?  Oh, I thought you were talking about his bathroom habits. 
[01:49:00]  Well, then the one, so let's go with a total of eight then.  There was eight there.  Let's say hi to Shane in Florida.  Shane, what's up?  Hi, boys.  Hey.  I just, I don't know if it's the line of the day, but it was pretty damn funny.  Boy, I said he liked to, he liked to take photos of women making toilets.  Making.  Pretty damn funny.  Yeah.  Making toilets.  Making.  Did they allow that?  I hope so.  I hope they would.  That's pretty innocent.  I don't see any problem with that.  I hope they allow that, because that's the free answer. 
[01:49:30]  Could actually be in a factory.  They're making toilets.  Yeah.  Well, we'll see what the line of the day is today, but it's going to be, it's got to  be one of his.  It just has to be.  Joe in El Paso, what's up?  What's up, Barney?  What's up, Patrice?  How do you know?  What's up?  Yeah, man.  That guy is the funniest guest ever, I think, in my opinion, man.  Yeah.  Yeah, he did a great job.  Is he too big to have his own XM show?  Oh, he's never going to.  What are you kidding?  That guy's huge now.  Joe, let me tell you what's going to happen. 
[01:50:00]  Silver Johnny.  We will never see him again.  The movie is going to be beyond huge.  They're saying it's one of the funniest comedies in forever, basically.  Like, they're pretty much saying it's the funniest comedy ever.  Yeah, I've never seen a movie get so many four-star reviews for comedy.  And they're already talking about paying him, what, $50 million or something like that for  his next movie, the gay character he does on Ali G.  Is he going to just run off to Africa for, like, three, four months and then come back  and not sign any contracts?  Oh, why?  Why did you have to do that? 
[01:50:30]  Because Dave Chappelle is a nut.  Why do you have to do that?  Because Dave Chappelle's crazy.  Relax.  You don't have to stick up for Dave Chappelle.  No, I'm not.  He blew it.  I predict that he'll be back, though.  Yeah?  I do.  Because I believe that he's at the level he's at right now.  He didn't grow with the show.  Yeah.  He's at a certain level.  Borat is big.  It's official.  And his next one, he'll come in and he'll be down.  I hope so.  There wasn't a dead spot in that 20 minutes.  How long do you give it before he is so sick of doing that character? 
[01:51:00]  That's the downside of doing a character-driven movie or interview.  Well, the beauty is, though, he's doing the press junket now.  And honestly, I think he only has to do it for a couple more weeks.  That's it.  And maybe at an award show or something, something like that.  But when a movie's huge like that, he'll be out on the street and people just be like,  Hey, Borat, do it.  Yeah.  He's smart, though.  Do the Borat.  That dude's smart.  He'll do it.  And then when they rise up against him because it gets too big, he'll just disappear into another 
[01:51:30]  goofy character.  He's been Ali G forever.  And that's still going on because that never hit that I'm tired of it stage.  And he'll do that thing.  Well, actually, I don't think many, a lot of people jumped on the Ali G thing.  But now with this, they're going to go back and get the DVDs and kind of catch up on what  that's all about.  I hate to admit it.  I haven't seen one Ali G.  I'm going out and getting it.  I saw a couple.  I'm going out and getting it today.  Now I'll get the box set.  Today I'm going to get it.  He's been famous in England forever.  Yeah.  Yeah.  So it's like, it is what it is. 
[01:52:00]  All right.  Let's say hi to Joel McHale.  Joel.  Hey, Joel.  Joel McHale.  Joel McHale.  Joel.  Joel fell asleep.  Oh, boy.  He didn't want to wait for us?  We got our buddy Joel McHale.  Hard hours over there at the soup.  Who does the soup?  He made me laugh pretty hard because he celebrated his 103rd show.  103rd?  Yeah, everyone does the celebration at 100.  Yeah.  He's hilarious.  He makes me laugh, man.  He can work those. 
[01:52:30]  He's a funny guy, man.  Well, he might have killed himself because the phone's not hung up, but we can't get him  on the line.  Joel.  You're killing us.  Is he playing the silent game with us?  Maybe.  He's sitting there laughing, snickering to himself.  Yeah.  He's made the soup worth watching every weekend.  He is good, man.  On the E channel.  It's hard to do those clip shows, you know?  Oh, it's disgusting.  And to make it entertaining like that, it's pretty good.  I'm going to put him back on hold.  He's very smug.  We'll go back to Joel in a minute.  Ross in Alabama, what's up?  Hey, it's Wes in Alabama. 
[01:53:00]  What's up, boys?  Hey, Wes.  What's up?  Patrice, what's up, chocolate face?  That's good, man.  That was a line from his movie.  Oh, that was a line from his movie?  That's funny.  I don't care, dude.  You don't have to have a disclaimer.  Dude, it's a line from the movie.  It wasn't me.  I swear to God.  I didn't say that.  Don't beat me up if you ever see me.  Whatever.  Do your thing.  Let's get it with you, Patrice, man.  I saw you in Birmingham here a couple of weeks ago, a couple of months ago, man, and you're  hilarious.  But we saw the pre-screening of that guy's movie, and he comes to Birmingham, Alabama,  and he gets etiquette training here. 
[01:53:30]  Yeah.  Holy crap.  It's hilarious.  He gets chased out of the place, so you guys just got to go out and see it.  You've seen the movie?  Yeah.  Now, how long is it?  I mean, it's regular movie length.  We saw the pre-screening.  Let me tell you, like an hour and a half, you know it.  Wait a minute.  Wait a minute.  What keeps that character from being boring for an hour and a half?  Like, what is in it to keep?  Oh, my God.  It's the interaction between people that have no idea that it's not a character. 
[01:54:00]  Oh, so it's like serious?  I mean, yeah.  Did I say that right?  What makes it so great is, like, part of it's written, and part of it is him just messing  with people.  It's hilarious.  A lot of political incorrectness.  The whole thing is totally wrong.  You guys would love it.  Yeah, I'm going to go.  Too bad we couldn't get a screening.  Roland?  The funniest part.  How the hell am I going to go see this movie this weekend?  I think I'm going to see it tonight.  Why didn't you invite me to a screening? 
[01:54:30]  I did, but there were all the times I emailed you guys about, they only had, like, three  screens.  I'm sorry.  Can you take the helium balloon out your throat, please, for a second?  Oh, Jesus.  Can you go into man's throat mode, please, sir?  Yeah.  Give us your deepest voice, Roland.  Hold on.  Hold on.  We're getting a bit from Roland.  You're done.  Roland, your new nickname is Tinder Voice.  You didn't have to be tased, Opie.  Well, it's my new bit, though. 
[01:55:00]  I know.  I've got to try it out.  I understand.  I've got to work out the bugs.  Hey, Roland, what's your deepest voice there?  Hey.  How are you?  I don't know.  Oh, my God.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  Can somebody get the lotion out of the basket?  Oh.  Did Borat's people like the interview?  They loved the interview.  They did, huh?  Yeah.  It seemed to go real well.  Yeah.  He and you really enjoyed himself.  He did?  Mm-hmm.  While you walked out with him?  Yep.  And what did he say?  He said, thanks very much.  I had a great time.  Does he remember our names?  Opie and Anthony. 
[01:55:30]  Yeah.  I'm thinking next movie, Patrice.  Maybe.  You never know.  Hey, did you see him out on the street?  Yeah.  Did you see him go out?  Were there people waiting for him?  On the other side.  He went on the right side.  People were waiting on the left side.  Do people look at him and go, oh, my God, that's that guy?  Is he highly recognizable now?  Yeah.  People walk in the building.  There was the double take.  By the time they realized it was him, he was already.  He is.  The Borat character is massive on YouTube.  Yeah.  It's just massive.  Yeah.  A lot of costumes on Halloween.  Halloween Borats.  Our own Danny was a Halloween Borat.  Oh, Jesus. 
[01:56:00]  A little too much.  He wore the bathing suit.  He got Borat to sign that bathing suit that he wore at the Halloween party.  All right.  I think Joel called back.  Joel.  Yeah.  We're giving you the nice plug and you're not even there.  Well, I could hear you guys talking and Roland kept saying, I'm going to call him right now.  I'm going to call him right now.  I'm going to call him right now.  And so I felt like I was in one of those dreams where I had died.  Yeah.  I was going, no, I'm right here.  I'm here, please.  Yes.  And then tears.  And then I was okay. 
[01:56:30]  Hey, Joel.  Yeah.  I think we have a pretty nice relationship going.  I think so, too.  You've done our show, what, almost 10 times now, maybe?  Yeah.  We could call it 10.  I saw the celebration you had for the 103rd episode of The Soup on the E! channel.  Is that something?  With our new pal, Joel McHale.  Is that something people do?  What?  Celebrate the 103rd show?  That's why he's good.  Yeah.  That's why he's good. 
[01:57:00]  Once a week.  That takes 10 years, but E! is like on five days.  Yeah.  Was it the 103rd airing of the same episode?  The air eight times, it only, yeah.  It takes about six weeks to get to 103 episodes.  Joel?  Yeah.  Got a little problem.  Uh-oh.  Saw a lot of people congratulating you on the 103rd show?  Right.  Where was the call for Opie and Anthony to congratulate their new friend, Joel McHale?  They want, those were people that came in to do the Daily Ten. 
[01:57:30]  Oh.  None of them actually came in to wish me anything.  We grabbed them and said, hey, would you say something?  Something tells me they'd.  And then for us to muster a camera crew together to fly to New York is.  Yeah, that would have been a bit much.  That's almost like going to Mars.  We'll send our own video.  Yeah, we would have made our own video, Joel.  I'm starting to think this relationship we have is like fake.  It's like, it's not a real friendship. 
[01:58:00]  It's not a real friendship.  It's a, hey, I need to promote and you guys need content.  Yeah, we're like friends with benefits.  I just kind of use you and then I leave you.  And then I'm like, hey, I don't have a girlfriend right now.  What are you doing?  Yeah.  Do they just drag in people for all those like clip show type things and like they're all day?  You know all those like countdown shows.  Yeah, the countdown shows and things like that.  I'm just thinking.  They don't have a few celebrities that come in for those.  Those are all kind of people that are kind of working. 
[01:58:30]  Whereas the Daily 10 or E! News gets actual celebrities and then people in the building go nuts when they're there and you can't make eye contact with them and the halls are cleared.  Oh, they tell you to knock it off.  And then I'm like, it's Michael Rappaport.  And they're like, don't even look at him.  Don't look at him.  Jesus, that's bad.  That's pretty funny.  You know what?  Michael Rappaport.  That's brilliant.  Our buddy Jim Norton did David Letterman the other day and I went for the taping and man, you're not allowed to look at Dave when he's not on that stage. 
[01:59:00]  We learned that.  Well, that's because that's for your benefit because you might melt because of his star power.  Yeah, I've heard people have either turned to stone, their hair gets that pure white.  He is.  He's now a legend.  Yeah.  So what are we working on for the soup?  Well, it sweeps.  Oh, boy.  People are going nuts.  Yeah.  And Tyra is going to tackle, and I'm not kidding, racism, homelessness, and modeling scams. 
[01:59:30]  The three most important things.  We're both obsessed.  This show and Joel McHale, we're both obsessed with Tyra Banks.  I didn't tell you my Tyra story.  I didn't tell you guys.  What happened?  I was on Tyra.  You were on Tyra.  They might cut me out.  They might absolutely have me removed.  You better hope for your career.  They cut you out.  Wait a minute.  I was, you know, she was doing a web show, and I was one of the judges because of the 
[02:00:00]  web junk thing.  Oh, Jesus.  They were showing films of, they were showing films, and I was one of the film judges, and  they had a girl that got up there, and the first film was, I've been fat my whole life.  Oh, no.  And I lost 15 pounds, and I just think that I'm a tough girl now, and, you know, everybody's  going, yay.  So she said, judge, number one, he's like, hey, girl, you are beautiful, and you should  stay beautiful, and everybody's like, yeah.  And I go, hey, hey, give it up for fat white women, because it's courageous to put fat white 
[02:00:30]  women on camera.  Give it up for a fat white girl on camera.  Come on, fat white bitch.  So she started crying.  Of course she did.  So Tyra gave her the, don't listen to him, girl, and then they cut my mic off for the  rest of this.  Wow.  Oh, what I love to see that clip.  I'm sure they burned it.  Oh, that's great. 
[02:01:00]  You've got to get to be friends with one of the editors and get a copy of that.  Yeah, is that how you guys work it?  So Tyra's doing all that for Sweeps Week.  What else is on TV this week that interests you guys?  And went to the Playboy costume party.  Okay.  And she wore, her costume was like an 80s aerobicizer instructor.  Yeah.  Yeah.  And people were wagering at the party whether vomit and tears come out of Lycra.  Oh.  And then, did you guys see that Chevy Chase is going to be on Law & Order? 
[02:01:30]  A story ripped from the headlines.  I saw the clip or the preview or whatever and very disturbing to see Chevy Chase in that  role.  He's so bad at acting.  He's such a horrid actor that he's trying to do the Mel Gibson thing is what they were  working on here.  He's got the drunk thing down.  Yeah, he's got that down.  But then you combine that with the anti-Semitism and then it's kind of like starting up a 74  Nova again. 
[02:02:00]  I think it kind of just looked like a reality show to me.  That seems like Chevy just walking around his house just blurting out anti-Semitic lines  and being drunk.  I guess this is a comeback of sorts.  Well, I got to tell you, we've been fortunate enough to meet a lot of people because of  what we do.  And I got to tell you, the most pompous ass ever.  Yeah.  We were on the John.  Which show were we?  Donnie Deutsch.  Which awful show were we doing at the time?  Yeah, we get to do all the awful talk shows. 
[02:02:30]  Although, we finally got to do Letterman, which was cool.  Yeah.  But before that, it was John McEnroe.  It was Donnie Deutsch.  Working the way up the ladder.  Our Donnie Deutsch interview never aired.  And we were on the same show as Chevy Chase when he was wearing a pink sweater and we  were in makeup together.  And the guy just wouldn't even acknowledge there were anyone else's.  Doesn't acknowledge anyone else's in the room.  In the room.  He couldn't get...  You remember the numbers...  Even, like, you'll hear that from six-year-olds.  Yeah, they hate him.  It was a fun ballroom and good candy, but that Chevy Chase, he's really full of himself. 
[02:03:00]  He couldn't get any friends for his role.  I heard about the Comedy Central role.  There's not one person who meant anything to him in an interview.  Oh, really?  Like, historically for us, like Bill Murray or whoever.  Right, right.  Whoever.  Jane Curtin.  Somebody...  The people that have worked with him in something.  Nothing.  Beverly D'Angelo.  No one.  Couldn't get her?  They had Greg Giraldi roasting him.  I'm like, why do they have people that don't know you roasting you?  And it's because nobody...  Oh, my God.  No one likes him. 
[02:03:30]  He's got their reputation.  He's got their reputation.  He's roasting...  Corn Michaels would have grown up.  Yeah, nothing.  No one.  So what else there, Joel?  Well, Courtney Love, also speaking of Mel Gibson, was helped by Mel Gibson by...  He brought a drug counselor to her.  Really?  Now, this is all in her new book.  And it's got a rejection letter that she received as a kid from the Mickey Mouse Club.  And the song goes like, am I see you in rehab?  And that didn't work at all. 
[02:04:00]  Don't tase Joel McHale.  I just tased you.  Dang it.  We cut that from the show, and now I know why.  Thank you.  But, you see, you know what the thing is.  You could say it on the show, and then you could put that little smirk on.  You can't smirk on the radio.  Yeah, and it'll be like the Native American looking at the trash.  Right, one single tear running down your face. 
[02:04:30]  All right, let me try this one.  Ready?  Okay.  Okay, now, this is true.  Ivanka Trump is now dating Topher Grace, right?  Really?  Isn't that exciting?  It's sad that I know that.  Who's Topher Grace?  Yeah, thank you.  They were in Las Vegas, and apparently they were cadoodling, and they were very close.  Upon hearing the news, Donald Trump was called Topher,  the biggest, most lavish, spectacular, nerdy indie film to ever bang my daughter. 
[02:05:00]  That worked pretty well.  That was very good.  All right, what happened to this?  I'm some sort of weird toastmaster.  You don't have anything on Madonna this week?  Oh, well, yes, of course.  We have set up, there's actually, we have whole new graphics for her.  We appeared on, we appeared, they showed a clip of the soup on Dateline NBC two nights ago  in showing how she is being vilified, and I'm not kidding.  Really?  So we were, the soup could not have been, I was watching it thinking, 
[02:05:30]  okay, we've got to watch the interview, and then they showed a clip,  and I have never been more complimented in my life.  Your show was being, was news.  Yeah, they cut to me saying how her check had cleared and they had her baby shipped to her.  All right, Joel, we're looking for the cheap Opie and Anthony plug?  Yeah.  Or we're going to have the pests attack you.  Wow.  Okay, we're sending a crew to you.  All right, so that'd be nice.  I might have to, this is how, we're going to literally have to buy bus tickets for these people. 
[02:06:00]  We can make our own video.  We got a handy cam.  But we expect a, we expect some kind of Opie and Anthony plug.  Yeah, of course we would.  We're looking for publicity.  What, now, you know that more, like 15 times more people listen to your show in one hour  than watch eight episodes of our show.  I know, but, but we even know that, you know, the goal is to be on TV.  There's something about TV.  You get a little more respect than doing this crap every day. 
[02:06:30]  Yeah, but everyone, hey man, if you, that would be great.  But I, but you, it is E, you know that.  Yeah.  You know that you're going to be hurting yourself.  It really is.  Yeah, it's not, it's not, yeah.  It's like you're going on the logo network.  Oh.  Oh.  Wow.  Look, man, if you're into the logo network, that's fine.  Yeah, what's the logo network?  It's the, it's the gay network.  Oh.  How did you know?  It's the poof, the network.  Because I'm bisexual. 
[02:07:00]  Oh.  Now it's out.  Of course you have to watch that for, for material for the soup, right, Joel?  Yeah, you, you must.  Logo, logo network is one of our go-to.  You must pull a lot of stuff from that network.  Yeah, we pull a few off.  A few clips.  Yeah, sure.  I can only do about two an hour.  Or pull a lot of stuff out of that network.  Whatever thing.  See, on TV, I can point.  Yeah, you can point, you can smirk, you can go, hum.  If it's not working, you go, hum, and move on to the next thing, and it looks cute. 
[02:07:30]  Make a big eye, like, hum, hum, hum.  And then we always feel slightly tired afterwards.  Yeah.  Hmm.  All right, Joel.  All right.  Joel, when?  Congratulations on getting Borat.  Yeah, that was pretty cool, right?  Yeah, what are the chances of him coming to the e-network?  Ooh.  Well, you know, if you gave us that opportunity to congratulate you on the 103rd episode,  You're not letting this go, are you?  We would have made something happen.  Okay, we're sending a crew now. 
[02:08:00]  Yeah, hi.  You made me cry.  You look at work, Dick.  I'm crying.  Oh.  All right.  No, he wouldn't come within five square miles.  It's part of a court thing.  Oh.  All right, Joel.  Joel, we'll see you on The Soup.  When is that?  This weekend.  Yeah.  Tonight at 10, and then it repeats 80 times.  80 times.  You cannot miss it.  I watch it during one of the repeats.  They're even sneaking it onto other channels now.  Yep.  Where they just shove it in, and all of a sudden, I was watching, what happened? 
[02:08:30]  I was watching CSI.  Right.  Now Soup is on.  All right, Joel, thank you.  I like that.  That's good.  Yeah.  It's just a matter of time before they cancel us.  No, you're doing fine.  That show's been on forever.  It's an institution now.  Yeah.  Institution, my friend.  Now I'm stuck, actually.  Yeah, you pretty much are.  All right.  Thank you, guys, and thanks for helping me lower your ratings this morning.  No problem.  Thank you, Joel.  You went from Borat to me.  All right.  All right, Joel.  Thank you.  Bye-bye.  There it goes.  Joel McHale from The Soup.  Joel McHale.  Watch The Soup. 
[02:09:00]  Carlos.  You guys got Borat?  Yeah, we got Borat.  We got Borat.  That is awesome.  Yeah, Borat was pretty cool, man.  I heard some of it.  It was funny stuff I've heard, man.  Yeah, I think his movie might actually do well.  Yeah, I think it's going to be a winner.  I'm not familiar with how Mexicans do it.  Is this sarcasm, or is he being serious?  You're not familiar with Mexican sarcasm?  Panamanian sarcasm.  I'm not sure.  Panamanian sarcasm. 
[02:09:30]  Uncircumcised sarcasm.  I don't get it.  Yeah, of course.  This is Carl Schman.  See ya.  Yeah, Patrice.  See, you're going to get me in trouble.  I'm not positively...  And everybody goes, oh, Carlos went out and said he's made his Mexican character after Borat.  Did you hear Carlos was a Mexican character?  German sure knows how to be a baby.  I can't forget.  Carlos is really from Kazakhstan.  He's not even Mexican. 
[02:10:00]  The guy's from Kazakhstan.  Carlos is...  His name is Borat Manseevich.  Yeah, we had a great morning, man.  Borat just killed it.  I know.  I was not being sarcastic.  All right.  Let me just check it.  And then Joel, you know, did what he did.  Oh, man.  Oh, my God. 
[02:10:30]  Phone-ins are just a...  Phone-ins should be illegal in the business, man.  They really are.  I just...  I can't...  You can never have the upper hand in a phoner.  Oh.  Like, when you guys call into a show, you just, you know...  Because we're all insecure asses.  You're on the phone by yourself, wondering if they're enjoying what you're saying.  You know they're looking at each other like...  Here's every phone call.  Back goes Griffey, looking up.  And it's out of here!  Or is it?  No, it's off the wall.  My mistake. 
[02:11:00]  It's almost there.  You think it's...  I...  I...  No.  He caught it.  I like the bad phone calls.  It just...  Oh, I can't do them.  Yeah.  Even that wasn't bad in terms of bad phone calls.  We've had some that were just the worst.  I've been bad phone calls.  I've been horrible waking up.  Yeah, but you know...  See, even that, though.  You go, ah, this sucks.  I'm getting out of here.  You'll just hang up on us.  Yeah.  You know, you'll see something's not working. 
[02:11:30]  It's like, ah, I'm out of here.  Goodbye.  Bye.  Like, the people that are on the phone, though, and they're...  They don't know the show.  They've never been on the show.  Oh.  Oh, can those get brutal?  So, Carlos.  Carlos?  Oh, I'm sorry.  We're talking again?  Not too much pressure on you.  Yeah, we're talking.  We're actually got to wrap up here, but...  No, go ahead, guys.  This show is kicking so much ass.  I just wanted everybody to know that I'm going to be at the Beacon this weekend, and we just  released...  The show's just sold out. 
[02:12:00]  We released, like, 200 tickets.  Oh, nice.  I don't want to know.  I don't want to be the guy to ruin the show.  But I just want you to know, next time I call in, I'm going to do my impression of  a Panamanian.  Yeah.  Incredible.  Ah, Panamanian sarcasm.  That's what we want to hear.  So, is the Philly show sold out?  Yeah, the Philly show is sold out.  We were...  That's tonight, Tower Theater.  All right, so you get tickets tomorrow night here in New York at the Beacon Theater.  Yeah.  All right, right on, man. 
[02:12:30]  All right, Carlos.  Thank you so much.  Nah, I love you guys.  This show's...  Show's kicking ass, man.  And it was not being sarcastic, you fat black dude.  I just didn't know.  It's hard to tell sometimes.  Carlos is like a nice guy now.  I forgot.  Carlos was angry before the mind of Mencia.  My mind home.  Yeah, what do you got?  Like, what are you on?  The 10th season of that?  It's been on forever.  10 seasons?  It's been on when it was the Ha Network.  It won't go off. 
[02:13:00]  The Daily Show, Colbert, and he's batting clean up, just like every other Puerto Rican.  He's running out of minorities to make fun of, so now he's making fun of space aliens.  He's the Albert Pujols of Comedy Central.  Carlos is like, what about these Eskimos?  Hey, what's with these rubbing noses, man?  You ever see these people in Bangladesh?  What is with these?  Like, what happened? 
[02:13:30]  What is with the Mongolians?  What are they, Chinese?  Peejeeves?  We're going to hunt a man on the street in Mongolia.  They're running out of races.  God damn.  I know what you're thinking.  I don't know what I think.  All right.  Colbert.  Next Colbert Report.  Next Colbert.  All right, Carlos.  Love you guys.  Love you still, man.  All right.  Thank you.  Thank you, man. 
[02:14:00]  Take it easy, Carlos.  The Beacon.  They just released more seats.  And that's how we end today.  Patrice, thank you so much.  You're welcome, Puddin'.  You've got to do another hour and a half with us.  Two hours.  All right, cool.  You've got to plug where you're going to be.  Bananas, Hasbrook Heights win.  Tonight and tomorrow, my pal Joseph T. Curry.  Is doing his comedy.  Very cool.  Where's the headline in the middle?  Joey Cola.  Hey.  He'll be over there at XM.  Patrice, we plug in anything over here? 
[02:14:30]  Yes.  November something or another.  I'm at...  Another awful plug from Camden.  It's November 17th.  How about you write this crap down?  18 or something or 19th.  I'm at Helium in Philly.  I'm in Philly.  Just go.  Write it on your hand or something before you come in.  Go to Helium.com at Helium Comics.  Oh.  You can't taste Patrice.  Look.  See, he doesn't go down.  He doesn't go down.  Damn it.  You know how we are.  See, he's still talking.  They're resistant.  We're like running out. 
[02:15:00]  No, but look.  See, he's still up.  He's still up.  What the hell is it going to take?  November 17th and 18th at Helium in Philly.  You think?  Something like that.  You know what?  We try to make the listeners not work so hard.  Okay.  November 17th and 18th at Helium County Club.  You're positive?  There you go.  I'm damn sure.  Damn sure.  All right.  Because your stand-up is beyond amazing.  I want people to go see you at the Helium.  I don't think.  In Philly.  And you're not trying to kiss my unus. 
[02:15:30]  You know what?  I'm going to see you in Philly.  That's what I'm going to do.  Oh, I said that last time, didn't I?  I did.  Oh, let me tase myself.  Whoa.  Opie goes down.  Look at that.  Oh, that had to hurt.  All right.  I did say I was going to see you at Stand Up New York,  which is like five blocks from my house,  and I never made it.  Liar, liar, pants on fire.  All right.  Listen, if you're not joining us over at XM Satellite Radio, 
[02:16:00]  have yourself a great weekend.  Yes.  We'll see you over there.  I can walk on my hands.  I can fart and chew gum.  I play the over.  I can ride a unicycle.  I wear a bra and laced panties.  So your talent is being queer, Travis?  It's the Opie and Anthony Walkover Talent Show.  If you have a unique skill, talent, music group, or physical affliction we want to exploit,  you can email steve at foundrymusic.com with your ideas,  or you can just show up during the walk to XM and start shucking and jiving. 
[02:16:30]  Shucking and jiving?  Jesus, Danny.  I don't write this sh**.  This is the Opie and Anthony Show.  The Opie and Anthony XM Walkover begins now.  There we go.  Yeah!  Holy s**t, it's cold.  I can tell you right now.  I broke out the winter coat today.  Yeah, you got the... 
[02:17:00]  Is that the new one you were talking about?  No, no, I got it.  I got one that's going to make yours look silly.  That's impossible.  This is the silliest coat ever.  Big hood and everything.  It's nice and warm, though.  And all that counts.  Actually, now that I look at yours, yours...  Mine's ridiculous.  Yeah, no one's going to top that one.  People laugh at mine.  Yes, I'm warm.  I'm a little worried about Andrew.  I'm starting to think he didn't appreciate the cake stomping.  We haven't seen it since.  I just would like to see him one time just so we can, like...  Feel better about ourselves?  Feel better about ourselves, yeah. 
[02:17:30]  Yeah, I don't want to think like he died in the cold thinking,  they smashed my cake.  Yeah, well...  I was...  Treat yourself.  Treat yourself.  As he just dies in a gutter of the cold.  That video moving to the top of the Opie and Anthony YouTube videos, by the way.  Top of the charts.  It's in the top five.  Is it?  Yeah, the top five.  Number one is Bill Burr taking on the Philly audience.  I earned that cake. 
[02:18:00]  That has like 130,000 hits.  Yeah.  Then it's us on Sean Hannity.  Really?  Then...  These are the top five.  I'm trying to remember now.  Then it's...  Yeah, keep working.  Oh!  Then it's our TV commercial that Phil Mushnick doesn't like.  Phil Mushdick.  And then it's...  What's her name?  That actress?  Oh, her.  Who?  What happened to the Nigga Nazi Challenge, you motherfucker?  Yeah, that's a biggie.  That's moving up the charts, but it's not in the top five yet.  Fuck that.  That was a big one.  Who was the actress, Ant? 
[02:18:30]  She was laughing her ass off and fell off her chair.  Oh, Mila Jovovich.  Yeah, she's one of...  Mila Jovovich.  She's one of our top Opie and Anthony videos on YouTube.  And then finally the cake stomping guys.  Hello.  How the fuck does that beat the Nigga Nazi Challenge?  How are you, sir?  Hello.  What does the hat stand for?  No sweat.  Make it easy.  Take it easy.  I like that.  Take it easy.  Live longer.  Where are you off to?  I'm off to...  He's off to the meeting of the elders of Zion.  Yeah, that's where I'm going right there.  The elders of Zion. 
[02:19:00]  There we go.  He's off to make the rules on the end of the earth, goddamn Jew.  Old motherfucker.  I was just trying to have a nice conversation with him, Patrice.  Man, fuck that old bitch.  Look at Patrice.  Fuck that nigga.  Talking to old Jews.  Don't we talking enough?  Look at this sissy.  Balls hanging out.  Oh, look at...  Wow.  That's right.  They're jogging.  Panties will do nice.  I love the people.  What's up, babe?  You got...  What you got? 
[02:19:30]  I used to be a big-time runner, but I never did that.  What you got?  Had a jog in place at the red lights.  Yeah, you have to stop and keep jogging.  What you got some bootleg purses up in that motherfucker?  Let's talk to this lady.  What you got?  What you got?  What you do?  You got some hats in there that your daughter made?  What kind of hats?  What do you got?  What movies you got in there?  What you got?  Borat?  What you got?  I don't see...  I don't know.  What you, Cambodian?  Oh, what do you guys got?  What are you selling today?  Everything.  Everything you can see me selling. 
[02:20:00]  I see hats.  I see scarves.  You got the new Borat movie?  Sir, we're free.  No, we don't see no movie.  Can I look in your bag?  Not allowed to go in.  No, God.  I'm not allowed to go in that bag?  What's going to happen if I go in that bag?  He's going to hit you with that cane.  That's a gun.  That's a cane knife.  I'll get arrested.  That's right.  How am I going to get arrested?  All I'm going to do is just call the man.  Hold on.  The skipper from Gilligan's Island.  Before you get the phone out of your pocket, I'm gone.  He's trying to get the lowdown from John Candy's cousin, Freddie Candy. 
[02:20:30]  Boop, little buddy.  Boop.  Boop.  Boop.  Hey, he's not watching his stuff anymore.  Let's wheel this crap away.  Let's go.  Take it with us.  Yo, hat man.  Take it with us.  What's up, my beautiful black princess?  Delicious.  I need to get me and my girl a girlfriend.  It's got to stop.  Fat boy Slim.  What's up?  There you go. 
[02:21:00]  Hey, how you doing?  Not you.  How will you never be fucked?  Look at the sister.  She has to ride the bus.  That's outrageous.  At least you can sit in one of the front seats, though, in this day and age.  That's right.  That's nice.  There you go.  That's right.  She doesn't have to get all that exercise, walk into the back of the bus.  Hello, ladies.  Look at this.  What are you doing later?  All bundled up.  Going to La Trapeze after this.  Yeah?  A little swinging.  Yeah?  With old seven chins.  Uh-oh. 
[02:21:30]  Bob?  Going to the airport, right?  That's me.  Okay.  That's Borat?  I'm Bob.  I go airport.  Yeah.  I thought that was from Islam letters.  That's 777.  I thought that's some letters from fucking Iraq.  It's in the car.  Oh, God.  What airport?  I hope this guy's a serial killer. 
[02:22:00]  What airport?  Opie and Patrice.  Yeah, that's me.  Yeah.  I got to go to LaGuardia.  It's in a car with a stranger.  Newark.  Newark.  Sorry.  Newark, right?  Was it JFK?  Teterboro?  Newark.  Hey, if I didn't know Big A, I just wouldn't want to know.  Look at creepy Big A.  Gibbs.  My name is Gibbs. 
[02:22:30]  Let's see how that plays out.  Is that what it is?  Gibbs?  Yeah, that's what it is.  Gibbs.  And it says the airport, right?  Yeah.  Which one did they have for me?  JFK.  Yeah.  I'm going out of American Airlines?  All right.  Good.  Yeah, JFK.  Okay.  How the fuck did they have to fly planes?  Oh, my God.  He's taking off with Anthony.  He's taking off with Anthony.  Yeah.  What's that, sir?  You think they didn't have help from the government hijacking planes? 
[02:23:00]  Look at him.  What's that?  Oh, it's taken care of, right?  Let's go.  I think it's all paid for, right?  You don't see this on the radio.  It's not paid for?  He's about as dumb as their food.  All right.  Then stop.  You don't see this on the radio, but...  I can't take the goddamn ride then if I've got to pay for it.  I thought I was free, my friend.  Anthony just got a free ride, XM.  Guy wanted me to pay for it.  Bicious. 
[02:23:30]  Yeah.  He just made him drive me.  Bicious.  Bicious.  He's not happy.  It's nice and warm.  He is pissed.  But he gave away all the info.  He goes, who, Gibbs?  I'm like, yeah, Gibbs.  Whatever.  He's now backing up on 57th Street.  Ah.  Screw him.  All right.  We're going right in today.  Yeah, it's too cold.  It was nice and warm in that limo, though.  Was it?  Yeah.  Thank you, guys.  Obi and Anthony XM202.  They are the most vile, despicable human beings in the country.  Creeps.  Ankle biters. 
[02:24:00]  Obviously, the strength is their ability to turn mistruth into something people would believe.  Wow.  How long is this guy going to continue to babble and say nothing?  All day long.  Shut up.  All right.  Here we go.  Welcome to the Opie and Anthony show.  It's worse than I imagined.  That's terrible.  I'm sorry.  We are a bunch of dopes.  I think we're lewd.  And we're probably pushing 20 arrests because of this radio show.  Out of touch. 
[02:24:30]  Corn balls.  Three retards.  We have the effect of Tylenol PM.  Opie.  You know I can have been a model.  Anthony.  I'm dead.  James Norton.  I like yogurt.  Robert Reed.  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road. 
[02:25:00]  We'll be right back.  We'll be right back. 
[02:25:30]  We'll be right back. 
[02:26:00]  We'll be right back. 
[02:26:30]  We'll be right back. 
[02:27:00]  All right.  Second half of the Opie and Anthony show.  There we go.  Why don't we have this over there?  Lyrics and children's songs.  We've got a lot of stuff to do still today.  Danny was laughing his ass off in the elevator about the dumps.  Just reading the dumps. 
[02:27:30]  Oh, really?  That Borat had.  Oh, good.  Let's do that.  It was so funny.  It was so funny.  It was so funny.  Were there a lot of dumps?  Yeah, there were seven of them.  I love it.  Any time it was like man's anise.  Any time it was talking about the man's anise.  Yeah, but they should just let that go.  I know.  I would love to get a fine because man's anise was said on the radio.  The goose liver part.  Give a copy to the dump report to Anthony.  Yeah.  God damn it. 
[02:28:00]  That's what it is about FM radio.  Keep the motherfucking cop asking the nigga for money for my fucking fruit cup.  No, not here.  Keith.  Fuck that.  Ah, we'll pay for it.  I got to go to the bank.  Here, here.  Don't take his fruit cup.  Please don't take his money.  Yo, don't take your money.  Here, here.  What the fuck's up with you, copper?  Motherfucking police.  Robbed me for my motherfucking drugs.  Now you're going to rob me for my fruit cup money, nigga.  I don't eat. 
[02:28:30]  Try the chicken gumbo.  I don't eat veal.  Why?  Is it a spiritual thing?  Because of the way they make the poor little guys suffer.  You are shitting me, right?  I made my choice years ago.  Veal is delicious and tender.  Come on, Mike.  But I won't.  There you go.  I won't fucking eat it.  You're shitting me, right?  I don't eat veal.  What the fuck is the difference between that and a stupid little chicken?  Who's stuck in a cage his whole life so he can have his head cut off. 
[02:29:00]  Chickens live a chickeny life.  They run around and just eat shit.  And they just all chickened up.  And what the fuck does a veal do?  A veal, they make them stand.  You know what they make them do.  I know what they make them do, but I don't care.  I don't like it.  I saw it.  You know what it is?  Here's my problem.  If I see the situation, if they show a documentary of how KFC makes the chickens take their clothes off and they...  Yeah, like in the cartoons.  And they're standing there freezing. 
[02:29:30]  I keep my feathers numbered for just such an occasion, I'll say.  Just such an occasion.  Come here, boy.  I'll teach you how to play baseball.  It ain't like that.  And they're fucking jolting them with electric probes up their assholes and then ripping their heads off with big machines.  And if I see it, I won't eat chicken.  That's why I can't watch it because I won't eat anything.  So you made the mistake of watching the veal show.  I made a mistake and I watched...  What the fuck was it?  The veal show on Discovery?  No, it used to be a show called...  Welcome to the veal show.  It used to be a show called Those Amazing Animals. 
[02:30:00]  It came on after That's Incredible years ago.  Yep, I remember that.  And they would, from time to time, before, when they actually had a heart, they would show fucked up shit about animals.  Like, I saw the baby seal clubbing and it just destroyed me at the time.  What's the name of that club?  You saw baby seals clubbing?  Club Headbust.  The P. Diddy seal.  Club eyes pop out the head.  It was just sad. 
[02:30:30]  And the saddest thing was the mother seals were crying.  And then, the next week, they showed how they make veal.  And it was just like, here it is.  I'm not trying to be a fucking fag.  I'm just saying...  Doing a good job at it.  I looked at the fucking...  I looked at the calf, right?  Yeah.  For it to live its entire life to be my food.  Like, they make it stand still so it gets mushy.  And just when it has no more muscle to stand up itself and falls down on the ground from just mushy muscles... 
[02:31:00]  Perfect.  ...if they fucking kill it so that I can have motherfucking veal hootie hootie.  Veal chops.  Not a veal cacciatore and...  No.  Veal of parmesan.  And I don't...  And it fucked me up as a kid.  Yeah.  So, I just never ate it.  So, every time they try to show me what they do to food, I turn.  Yeah.  Any time it's like, we have an expose on what they do with ham.  I'm like, fuck, nigga.  I don't want to stop eating ham.  So, I turn, you know. 
[02:31:30]  You turn the channel real quick on swine.  Because if they say, they say, here, piggy, piggy, and they go, and the pig goes in the room, and then he looks around and goes, oh, no.  And then they shoot him in the back of the head.  And then another pig goes, slams the phone down.  They fucking killed him in the way.  Hey, that pig, nothing we can do.  Nothing we can do about it.  Nothing we can do about that pig.  They couldn't do nothing.  How about lobster?  Because they always, you know, I always feel better about how...  Yeah, they put him in a pot, Hank. 
[02:32:00]  They put him in a pot, like, boiling.  I used to do a bit about this.  Sorry.  Crabs.  Is that about...  Because I'm a real animal lover.  But I eat meat and stuff.  I wear leather and things like that.  But God made it so that I can eat.  I'm glad our food comes killed and murdered.  Yeah.  Because if I had to murder my own food, if I had to kill a cow or kill a chicken...  You'd be the size of a human?  God, God...  Motherfucker.  Put fish here to kill. 
[02:32:30]  Because fish don't have any eyebrows.  Any animal without eyebrows that can't, like, make the face...  Like, if you were stabbing a motherfucker, right, with a knife,  and he didn't have eyebrows, and he was just looking at you as you're stabbing him,  and it's hurting, but he can't...  He don't have no voice, and he ain't got no eyebrows.  So you're killing him, and he's like, this is killing me.  Like, you take a fish out the ocean, immediately it's suffocating to death.  Yeah.  So, it can't breathe, it got a hook in his mouth, and then you just cut it up till it dies. 
[02:33:00]  But it doesn't look any different than it did when he was swimming.  Alive and dead fish look the same.  Yeah.  And you go, and you just go, okay, I'll kill a fish and lobster.  You take it, it's living, like, hey, and then you put it in, and it turns red.  But during that time, you're fucking boiling it to death.  And it's fucking sad.  It's sad.  I don't want to think about it.  But we are...  See, the thing is, I call it this.  We're top of the fucking food chain. 
[02:33:30]  We're the big man on campus.  We're not top of the fucking food chain.  On this planet.  We're not top of the food chain, Mr. Got a Gun, Mr. Fucking...  Exactly.  We were able to fashion a tool, a simple tool.  You're fucking not the top of the food chain.  I'm going to tell you why.  Because you have to go to where something else is at the top of the food chain where it's at.  And with a gun, and with a knife, or whatever you do, you attack it.  That's because of our brains.  Why don't you get in the ocean, and just fucking sit there and wade in the pool, man, in a shark cage with a fucking spear gun. 
[02:34:00]  Exactly.  That's what I'm saying.  But not top of the fucking food chain.  We are because of our fucking brains.  We're not top.  Do you think if a lion could fucking lean up against a tree and hide and then go, ding, ding, ding, ding, and tiptoe out, tap you on the shoulder, and fucking rip your head off?  You don't think it does?  No, he's thinking.  Look, I saw a fucking documentary last night about a killer alligator in India.  Killed 200 motherfuckers.  It's almost like a cartoon.  That's because Indians are stupid when it comes to alligators. 
[02:34:30]  They're fucking down by the river, washing their clothes.  The same alligator's killed 20 people in the same spot.  That's what I'm saying.  Get a fucking bait tag, you savage.  If you're butt naked and I'm fucking butt naked, it's like you are, we're probably.  I'll give the alligator credit when he jumps out of my fucking Maytag and bites my head off while I'm washing my clothes.  Because I ain't going down to the river and washing my fucking clothes.  Oh, if he comes and knocks on the door and says, hey, Timmy sent me.  Hey, UPS.  Hey, what's happening, man?  Exactly.  And bite your head off.  And let's go back to your example of the shark thing. 
[02:35:00]  Take the shark out of the water, then what?  Yeah.  Let's see a shark get on a city bus.  What the fuck?  Would you say that?  That's like they take us out of this fucking room.  But why would we go in the water and put you in a scorpion pit?  We can go in into the water and breathe and kill things in the water.  In the fucking water, we can do that.  We can survive in the water.  We can't survive in the water.  Did you see open water?  That's what happens to us in the water.  It's a limited time, but we can do it.  We can do it.  We can do it.  We can do it.  Look, the fact that we have this thing called technology makes it all make sense. 
[02:35:30]  The fact that we believe in our own hype, that we're special and shit, but for the fact  that animals can't.  But one day, I'm going to tell you, I can't wait until one day aliens come down, and they  fly, and they stop, and we're begging for our lives.  And all the alien here is, and he's like, I got a family.  Please don't kill me.  Please, sir.  And you go, and he goes, I'm going to just shoot this piece of shit right in his head.  And you're like, now I'm agreeing with you 100%, and you've just made my fucking point. 
[02:36:00]  Thank you.  You know why?  Why?  Because until that point, I'm going to be the motherfucker that goes, what?  What?  I'm eating everything.  It's fine.  Because when the aliens come, we're going to be sitting there going, arf, arf, arf,  arf, looking like idiots.  I'm glad there's motherfuckers like you who can murder food.  I don't understand anything that looks at you.  I'll eat it, but I can't kill it.  I could not do it.  I can't even kick.  I couldn't kick a dog. 
[02:36:30]  It's just different.  I could kick a human.  That's Opie's job.  Hey, that was a legend.  I could kick a human, but it's just.  No proof.  I mean, I hate to say it.  I mean, really, we were talking about King Kong a long time.  I watched.  I finally got on DVD, and I just kept.  Oh, no.  I kept fast-foring it, and I just.  It.  It.  It.  I.  I.  I was close.  Did you cry?  I was close.  At the end of King Kong.  The motherfucker just was.  Too expressive.  What made it fucked up is that she was like, don't kill him. 
[02:37:00]  Yeah.  They were in love, nigga.  Ain't that fucked up?  But it was scenes in that movie where he was doing real guy shit.  He finished fighting the Tyrannosaurus.  He's like.  And he just looked at her like, you fucking cunt.  And he just started walking.  And she's like, wait, baby.  Yeah, bitch.  Get on my shoulder.  And he just ignored her.  And then she started to do a little dance.  And she's like, look at this hot little piece of ass.  He's like, bitch, move.  I'm looking at the sun.  It ain't all about you, hoe.  And it's like.  I was like King Kong, nigga. 
[02:37:30]  I fell in love with the motherfucker.  And then, and she fell in love because he, he really was like, that's how he was showing  how to get a bitch.  He was breathing.  And she, and he was like, and he's like, look at him like, I'm that monster, huh?  I'm that motherfucker that's just ooga booga.  Beating my chest and everything, right?  I'm eating white women and all that, right?  And now it's all.  And then he just started running.  Yeah.  I was like, this is fucking amazing what they did with this animal.  And then he went on the top of the Empire State Building, dude, and took a fat one for 
[02:38:00]  nothing.  I couldn't, I was, I was upset.  It hurt.  Wasn't that bad.  I love when human beings die in movies, man.  That's why I love, in my monster movies, I need the monster to be somebody that, like  the Godzilla.  I hated that, that the new Godzilla.  Yeah.  Because you fell for it.  It had babies.  It got stuck in a bridge and it just wanted to live.  It's like, make my motherfucking monsters mindless assholes, like, like the one that, like  Harry, Harryhausen used to make, the, the Kraken, where he stopped animation. 
[02:38:30]  Oh, yeah, yeah.  Or the monster from 2000 Depths that look at, or the gargantuan that look at a woman and  go, hmm, that was delicious.  Chomp and spit her out.  No emotion.  No emotion.  You don't know where they came from.  You don't know why they're like they are.  An evil monster.  That's it.  No family.  The original Godzilla.  No family, no friends, no nothing.  Kill people.  That's it.  Kill people.  You understand?  The original King Kong, just that big eyes and them big teeth.  Yeah.  And he goes, I'm going to kill everybody except for this white woman. 
[02:39:00]  But the other King Kong, like the new one, not the 76.  I felt bad for the 76 King Kong.  Come on.  The motherfucker had feelings.  And then the new King Kong, did you see when he, they choked him, he was choking with the  gas.  The old King Kong, the eyes blinked slow and then he fell.  Cause it's like, yeah, get that evil King.  The other 76 King Kong.  Yeah.  Why did they have to show him on the way to his death in the bottom of the boat, sitting 
[02:39:30]  there like a nigga in lockdown with his knee, with his knee up.  Cause one knee was up and one leg was pointed straight and the other hand was on his left.  He was sitting there in the bottom of the boat and Jessica Lange, he looked at her and  he looked at her like, bitch, why you do this, man?  I wasn't going to hurt you.  And she dropped her scarf and he caught it and smelled it.  And she fucking fell in there.  He caught her, kept the scarf, smelled it, let her fucking go. 
[02:40:00]  And then that's when, that's when that bitch realized, wow, this motherfucker is not no  mindless animal.  This one, they stepped it up even another notch.  They went, yeah.  He's choking like, dog, I'm only trying to get her.  We love each other.  And so the bitch comes back like, I ain't supposed to, I ain't supposed to be in love  with this animal.  This is not, I'm in love with you.  You goofy, big nose Jew.  The pianist.  I have to be in love with the pianist.  No, bitch, you in love with me.  I'm fighting monsters.  What's this faggot doing?  He ain't doing shit. 
[02:40:30]  I'm killing Tyrannosaurus Rexes.  I'm motherfucking killing giant snakes, birds.  I'm falling and shit.  You know, there's a lot of other dead bitches that couldn't, that didn't keep my attention.  And I'll introduce you to sunshine.  I'll introduce you to all types of shit.  You ain't had no excitement in your life till you fuck with me.  And this is what you do to me?  Look at the emotion.  That's exactly what it was like.  I fucking hated that shit.  My God.  Make my monsters.  You make a damn good point.  Make my monsters.  I don't want to see Freddy Krueger, like the fact that he was touched by, if he has a 
[02:41:00]  scene where, I'm sorry, I come in your dreams, man.  They burn me up and I had an addiction that I couldn't control.  Nigga!  Put your glove knife on and fucking kill it, motherfucker.  I don't want to hear your fucking problems.  Bitch, motherfucker.  I don't want Jason going, look, I drowned.  They killed my mama.  What would you do?  Right.  They killed my mama.  What would you do? 
[02:41:30]  You know what I'm saying?  Stupid camp kids weren't looking, weren't watching out for me.  I drowned.  I drowned.  I was sitting there, I was just in the lake.  She chopped my mama's head off, man.  Yeah.  What would you do?  And you go, you know what, Jason?  Go do your thing, man.  Go do your thing.  I don't need that shit.  I don't need that.  Like, Frankenstein.  I don't need that.  I don't need you feeling for a motherfucker, man.  I like the way, though, Frankenstein, the original one, with the girl.  The girl, like, gave him the flower and shit, but then he winds up snapping her neck and  throwing her down the well or something. 
[02:42:00]  And that was sad.  I felt like that in my life.  What, did you want to throw a little girl down the well?  No, no, no, no.  That you just, he didn't know.  She threw, what she did was throw, like, a doll or something in the water.  And he was like, yay.  And I've done that before.  I've, like, seen, I just wanted to do the right thing.  Like, we used to, back in the day, used to turn on the fire hydrants and shit.  So the fire hydrant water would spray out.  So I see one dude, this dude named Tony, he would do anything to a girl. 
[02:42:30]  And, like, it would just end up fun.  And everybody would be laughing at the end.  And so I tried to do it.  And I took a girl.  He put her in front of the fire hydrant pole.  But he knew how to do it.  I didn't know how to do it.  And I just would, I'm copying.  I'm getting ready to throw a little girl in the water.  And I take her.  And I grab her by her arms before she could ever say stop.  Her face is in the fire hydrant water.  And she's choking. 
[02:43:00]  And I'm, and I let her go.  And she flops down in front of the hydrant.  With the hydrant is spraying over her.  And some of the water is falling in her face.  And I just ended hydrant day.  Because this bitch almost drowned.  You fucked it up.  I ended hydrant day.  Hydrant day.  And everybody, thank you, sir.  Everybody's chasing me around.  You know what I'm saying?  That's why I got those, I got certain feelings.  I was always that awkward motherfucker.  And, you know, it takes you back. 
[02:43:30]  It takes you back being awkward, man.  With shit just, uh-oh.  I'm the nigga.  I'm King Kong.  I just want to, and now it's like your brother and his, all his friends are coming with, coming  to jump me because I just wanted to grab your ass and play.  Yeah.  But you wasn't playing like that.  You know?  Nah, I agree with you.  But veal is tasty.  Yeah.  Me, I know, right?  But I can't do it.  All I think about is those little eyes not blinking.  Hey, Matt in Jersey.  What's up, Matt? 
[02:44:00]  What's up, guys?  You're calling in.  Patrice, you're such a fucking pussy.  I see.  Man, look, man.  Have a heart, would you?  You are such a pussy, man.  And you are a stereotypical black male.  You know that?  Why?  You are scared of water, and you love you some chicken.  You are a fucking pussy.  I love chicken, but, you know, if I saw a chicken being murdered, I'd probably wouldn't.  Then you would change your mind.  I would change how I eat it.  Sure.  John in Tennessee, what's up? 
[02:44:30]  Hey, what's going on, boys?  Hey.  Hey, Patrice, you would rather hire a hitman to do your killing for you.  I'd rather watch Bambi step out in the woods, blow his lungs out, and then rip his guts out, take him home, and eat him.  Well, because you're a coward, man.  First of all, you said Bambi.  You didn't say the fucking Yeti, motherfucker.  You didn't say the Abominable Snowman.  You didn't say, I'm going to hunt the fucking stingray that killed the crocodile hunter, you fucking fag.  You said Bambi. 
[02:45:00]  I said, I don't.  I'll go after a bear.  You'll go after a bull.  Oh, shut the fuck up.  Now change your animals.  With your bare hands.  You said Bambi first, because it's cute, and it's innocent, and it is a cowardice act.  Go after something that can fight you back, and then fight it on its own terms, if you fucking nasty like that.  Well, that's why we're talking about the food chain.  We got the minds to build the machines.  To build the machines.  But we're talking about nature, man.  Let me tell you something.  I can't hunt.  I'm not a hunter.  I love guns. 
[02:45:30]  I love shooting.  I love target shooting.  I can't hunt.  I'm not a hunter.  I always felt bad after I shot something.  Even though we were, you know, killing it and eating it or whatever.  But it's like, you kind of go like, eh, I kind of feel like I took a life, and, you know, you feel bad about it.  But wrap up any piece of fucking meat, I'll eat it.  I'm the same way.  I've eaten ostrich meat, and ostriches have a personality.  A big head on the edge of that stick neck.  What do you mean they have a real personality?  They have, like, big eyelashes. 
[02:46:00]  That's like eating a koala sandwich.  Like, they're nice animals and shit.  They give something.  A koala sandwich.  Koala are like things that you just go, hey, man, how are you?  But here's the thing.  Here's why hunting deer is such a faggot thing.  I'm going to tell you why.  All right.  A lot of people are going to disagree.  Deer have no natural predators.  So they stand there, and the only thing that keeps them moving is because they're just a little bit nervous about anything. 
[02:46:30]  Don't like bears.  No.  No.  Don't look lions or mountain lions.  A bear might eat it.  A mountain lion.  But, like, an antelope, a lion is an antelope's natural predator.  It's looking out for a fucking lion, an antelope.  Yeah.  The reason you ever see those Serengeti things with a yak or whatever, the wildebeest, they go down to the fucking lake or whatever,  and the motherfucking alligator comes and chews one, brings it in, and the other one's back up for a second and then go,  all right, nigga, I'm going to get some of my water. 
[02:47:00]  That's because those creatures don't have natural enemies, natural predators.  That's why deer get hit in the street.  They don't know not to go in the fucking street and get hit.  So when they're drinking to some fucking asshole with a reindeer hat and a reindeer whistle,  and the reindeer's like, what the fuck's going on here?  He shoots him in the head and you're carrying around like,  Onga Bunga, I am the caveman.  You fucking faggots. 
[02:47:30]  Why don't you run up on an elk and try to choke him with your bare hands?  Sneak up on him like a fucking, like a soprano with some wire and go behind a fucking antelope naked with a grass skirt.  Kill him like Carlo.  You got to get him in the car first.  That's the toughest part.  Get him in the front seat of the old fucking Chevy.  Hey, elk, just don't lie to me.  Just don't say you ain't know.  You're out of the family business.  Let's go to Alex.  Take you to Vegas.  Alex, gotta pay a toll.  Alex from Miami. 
[02:48:00]  Elk at the toll booth.  Alex.  What the fuck?  Hey, how you doing, guys?  Hey.  Hey, we want to come upstairs?  Oh, you did the walkover today?  I took the stupid pass over and I didn't make it in time.  I just flew down from Miami.  I just want to see, you know, can you see the studio and go with you guys?  I just flew from Miami.  My arms are killing me.  So we get Alex and bring him upstairs.  All right.  Stay there, Alex.  Let's say hi to Ben.  What's up, Ben?  Hey, guys.  Hey.  Hey, Vitrice, let me overanalyze this for you for just one second. 
[02:48:30]  Go ahead.  Okay, now you stole my deep deal because you saw what happened to him.  And wait, wait, let me preface this, though.  It's not that I'm telling motherfuckers not to eat veal.  It's because I saw how they ate veal and it affected me.  Personal decision.  It just affected me.  That's all.  Personal choice.  I'm not preaching.  Maybe he reminds you of your dad.  Maybe he, in the 60s, your dad maybe crossed the line. 
[02:49:00]  I never met my dad, you fucking cocksucker.  So Dr. Phil fuckface.  Yeah, look at him.  Just to psychoanalyze an ass.  I never met my dad.  If anything, maybe King Kong might represent me in a way that maybe I might feel that way  in white society.  In this society.  I might feel that way.  Well, you know what that whole movie was about.  Of course.  Let's be real here.  And that's the sad thing is that I wish it had stayed the 1933 version where it's just  a mindless motherfucker.  The way that white people back then portrayed a nigga, just a big-eyed, eating motherfuckers 
[02:49:30]  instead of what it would turn.  This, the newest movie was more like a black man than the first movie.  Yeah.  The first movie was Monster.  This one I, I'm not supposed to identify with.  Jungle Fever 2.  Yes.  That's what it is.  Because she, they had her so in love.  She, and in the end, if you watch the new one, in the end, she never goes to the pianist  and goes, I love you.  And she never screamed for his help.  She only tried to save the fucking monkey. 
[02:50:00]  Yep.  It, it, it, so I, it, I identify with, you know, not being understood.  A big, silly motherfucker growing up.  I was a big, silly motherfucker.  There was an outtake from the, uh, the first one.  Oh boy, here we go.  T'was beauty killed the nigga.  And then they decided to change it just to leave it a little more, uh, you know, obscure  than to make it that obvious.  You don't think that that choking scene was Rodney King when they threw the thing and he's 
[02:50:30]  choking and they just keep throwing shit or, or he, he's, uh, I'm surprised they didn't  shove a plunger in King Kong's ass, a giant plunger while he was chained up.  I'm surprised, wait a minute, if you count how many times the plane shot him, 41 times.  41 times.  41 times.  Hey, he did pull out his wallet and it looked like a gun.  Swear to God.  All right, let's go.  Let's do the dumps for today. 
[02:51:00]  Ah, the dumps.  And then, hold on, I want to make sure this guy's here when we get back.  Steve.  Steve.  Ed, it's Steve.  Steve from Florida.  Steve, Florida.  We're going to you next, so stay there.  All right.  Yeah, try to get that guy.  Make sure he's there.  All right, the dumps for today.  Yes, uh, well, it's 7.20 a.m.  Hooking up electrodes to a woman's vagina.  See, we knew.  See, we just knew, Patrice.  Yeah.  Patrice O'Neill talking about the Paul R. Nelson commercial.  At 7.57, my anus hang loose like a dog's mouth. 
[02:51:30]  Borat talking about going to the bathroom.  Bang, bang, bang in the anus of another man.  Borat.  Fill anus with goose liver so there's no tearing.  Borat.  She is tight like a man's anus.  Borat describing his prostitute sister.  Tit.  Borat.  Dog style.  Borat.  Which didn't make sense in anything, the context or anything. 
[02:52:00]  He was talking about a real dog, but what are you going to do?  And, uh, 8.15, I have never made romance inside another man.  You can't even talk about inside.  That's too bad.  The old days, wow, you could say, fuck him in the ass.  That's why we got the XM.  All right, could you?  We're going to shove some food down our trots and we'll continue in just a bit.  It's the worst of the Opie and Anthony F.U. line.  Fuck everyone.  Fuck you. 
[02:52:30]  Fuck you.  Hey, it's Big D, Sydney, Montana.  Fuck you to my boss who takes off and goes out down and I have to work all weekend long.  Fucking bullshit.  Fuck you, cunt.  I want to give a big fuck you to mobile storage, you fucking cock-sucking bastard.  Hope you all go to hell and fucking rot there for the rest of fucking eternity, you piece of shit.  Especially you, fucking Jody, you cock-sucking bastard. 
[02:53:00]  Fuck you.  And fuck everybody that works there.  Yeah, this is a big fuck you to my boss calling me at 6 o'clock in the morning.  It's you, how's it going, you're drunk.  It's taking off when you want it on you.  Fuck you.  Yeah, I'd just like to say fuck you to Opie and Anthony.  I can't get I'm Paul R. Nelson out of my mind.  I'm Paul R. Nelson.  Fuck all y'all.  Call the Opie and Anthony F.U. line at 866-FU-LINE-1. 
[02:53:30]  That's 866-FU-LINE-1.  Fuck you.  Fuck you.  Fuck you.  Yeah, fuck him.  They call me the Seeker.  I've been surfing over.  No way, not like this.  I won't get Superman four stars, it was the worst.  Till the day I die.  Yeah, I didn't like Superman. 
[02:54:00]  It was just...  Nah.  Kevin Smith put it best when he goes, you know, when I go to a comic book, you know, superhero  movie, I'd like to see him at least punch one guy.  You know?  Superman didn't fucking do anything.  He was too nice.  He flew around.  He didn't kick any ass.  He didn't fly around.  He just did a lot of floating.  It was floating around.  He didn't fly like, you know, Superman.  You go 3D on that?  Best scene was the airplane, yeah.  Did you wear the 3D glasses?  I fucking...  You know what?  I wanted to shoot some jizz on the 3D screen.  I just wanted to just take a shit right in the theater. 
[02:54:30]  It made me sick.  Yeah.  I kept waiting, kept waiting.  So I was just talking about this Borat thing.  They're giving it all these good stuff, but they gave Superman 4, and I'm almost thinking  that any universally loved movie has to stink, because Departed, they gave 2.5 in Daly,  and they gave him Borat 3.5, 4, and I think it's probably because they're like, oh, he's  so smart and so...  I hope it's not one of those critically acclaimed, because critics are assholes. 
[02:55:00]  Have you ever seen a critically acclaimed movie that was actually you loved?  That they just, wow, 47 stars.  This is the greatest movie ever made.  That's a good question, actually.  I can't think offhand, because I don't remember the reviews for any of the films.  You see Payback with Mel Gibson?  You think that got four stars?  That was a fantastic movie.  Did not see that.  You gotta see Payback.  People will stop hating him if Payback becomes one of his great movies.  All right.  Hold on.  Steve has been on the line for a while. 
[02:55:30]  I hate the road warrior.  I don't care what the fuck he did.  I don't care what he did after that.  Let's say hi to Steve in Florida.  Steve.  Hey, guys.  What's going on?  Hey.  Oh, man.  I'll tell you.  You're not going to believe this one.  Saturday night, my old man calls me up.  All right.  Hold on.  Hold on, because I know what you're about to say.  You're married.  Yeah.  How long have you been married?  About three and a half years.  Kids?  One.  High school sweetheart?  What's the deal with the marriage? 
[02:56:00]  We dated.  No, she used to be my secretary.  Married before her?  Nope.  Never been married.  Okay.  All right.  So we got the back history.  Married three, three and a half years.  You got a kid.  And who called you up the other day?  My old man calls me up.  My dad.  Okay.  And he says...  How old a fella are you?  I'm 37.  All right.  And my wife is 23.  Okay. 
[02:56:30]  Maybe that's a problem.  But my dad calls me up, tells me to go check out this porn site.  And I said, Dad, I'm not into it.  He said, no, you want to go check out this porn site.  Simply Great Porn.  So I punch it in, and as soon as I punch it in, there's my wife in the upper right-hand corner.  Oh, boy.  You found your wife on a porn site.  Actually, your dad did.  Now, is there a website?  I don't know what's more disturbing, my dad surfing porn sites or my wife doing it. 
[02:57:00]  Yeah, that's got to suck for him.  He's like, damn, I don't want anyone to know that I'm freaking surfing the internet for porn, but I've got to let my son in on this one.  My dad's 87.  Wow.  87, and he's trolling porn sites, eh?  God bless him.  Yep.  Hey, can you give us the website off the air so we can check it out?  Sure.  All right, hold on to the line.  I thought he said it, and I thought I had it.  Oh, did he?  I think I...  Yeah, I said it, yeah. 
[02:57:30]  Oh, you did.  I'm sorry.  I think I had it.  All right, which one is she?  We got the site up.  No, I don't have it.  Shit.  Simply Great Porn.  All right.  And she's in the right-hand corner.  That's not her real name, though.  What name is on the screen?  Sarah.  That's your wife?  That's my wife.  Oh.  It's like, hi, I'm Sarah.  Come chat with me.  Free.  Can you turn it down for a second now?  Is this a big, like...  Are you trying to just push this website with this dumb story?  Because, you know... 
[02:58:00]  No.  We were willing to bite.  Yeah, we could just give you the free plug.  I mean, you already did it, but...  Is that really your wife?  Come on.  No, I swear.  So what's the problem?  The problem is I had no idea that she was doing this.  Right.  This was a complete surprise, and she's sleeping, as my dad's calling me.  Right.  And so I wake her up, and I say, what the hell is this? 
[02:58:30]  She freaked out.  She goes, how did you find it?  I says, my dad called me.  Okay.  If my dad saw it, I says, but that's not the point.  But the point is, she says, it's something that I've always wanted to do.  It was a fantasy.  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Yeah.  I called Bravo Sierra.  We've been doing this way too long, sir.  You're just way too casual.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I was going to ask, where's she at right now? 
[02:59:00]  Right.  Yeah.  Where the fuck's she at?  She at work?  Yeah.  He's just, and you know, this, that.  First of all, the guy wouldn't, he wouldn't call a radio show.  Like, that right there is enough.  And he said Saturday, he'd still be in shock and in pain if he's a square.  I mean, I'd appreciate the fact if I found my girl's old porno shit, but it's like this  guy.  You're a whole different breed there, Patrice, let me tell you.  God damn, bitch!  Yeah.  But it's like, and that's too professional and too not, that's a non-under-the-carpet 
[02:59:30]  kind of porn site.  She's like, hi everyone, I'm married and I fucking, I'm a porn bitch.  But it's not, if she was on Scuzz, but one of those Scuzzy, like there's some shit you  go to, like the Hun, where you just pop on things and go, wow, this is some disgusting  shit.  Yeah.  That's all pro.  Like, that's a full-time job for her.  Yeah.  That's pro.  That's fucking pro.  The lighting's too good for a cam and all that.  Yeah, she's doing that full-time. 
[03:00:00]  What does she say she does for work?  Where's she at?  Where the fuck's she at now?  We've been just at this game a long time.  Don't pull the wool over our eyes, sir.  All right, we got the gay evangelist.  Evangelist.  We got that story.  We got, oh, remind me, we got to play Jim Norton on Letterman the whole set.  We were supposed to play this yesterday, and Jim's in Atlanta, so we'll do that going  at the break.  Someone remind me on that.  We got Shame, Shame, Shame on You.  A new one?  Yeah. 
[03:00:30]  What was the problem?  Special needs girl late to school all the time because of long bus ride.  Okay, I got to hear this.  Yeah, right there.  Yeah, yeah, we'll go right to that.  What about the wax lipping?  No, retard beats out wax lips.  And what about some children's lyrics appropriate for children?  Question mark?  Oh, that's too vague.  Yeah?  Yeah, I don't know what it means, but I could, you know, Shame, Shame, Shame, Retard, Long  Bus Ride, it's easy for me. 
[03:01:00]  All right, let's see.  All right, Arnold Diaz, Shame, Shame on You.  Shame, Shame, Shame.  Last month, we reported that 17-year-old Andrea Avant, a special needs student, used to love  going to school until this year, when the bus trip became a nightmare.  Tell me about the bus, Andrea.  They're late.  They're late.  They're late.  Yeah, they're late.  Every day?  Every day. 
[03:01:30]  Every day.  Yeah, every day.  As we told you, the bus Andrea rode had to pick up 17 special needs students on a long  route, starting in Far Rockaway, winding its way through Queens, not arriving at the  Information Technology High School in Long Island City, until 9.30 or 10 o'clock, long 
[03:02:00]  past the school's 8 o'clock starting time.  So, Andrea, you're on the bus for two to three hours in the morning?  Two hours.  Yeah, two to three hours in the morning.  Oh, who was talking first?  And then who stepped in?  You know, you know, because, well, you know.  Problem.  Problem.  I have a problem with the name of this school.  Yeah.  Shouldn't finger painting be in the title of that school somewhere? 
[03:02:30]  So how does Arnold help?  He's a do-gooder.  He visits the bus company.  Mm-hmm.  The long trip we reported violated the Education Department's own guidelines that say no students  should be on the bus longer than 90 minutes.  But Michelle Levant said her daily complaints were falling on deaf ears.  Because it's a special needs child, a child who doesn't have a voice, it's like, we'll get  to it when we get to it.  It has to be done now. 
[03:03:00]  And we told you, unbelievably, the manager of the Little Richie bus company pleaded ignorance.  The parents say they've been calling and making complaints, and you're the general manager.  Shouldn't you know about the problem?  Honestly, I didn't know about the problem.  Yeah.  No, I didn't.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Whenever the guy admits to it.  Right.  Like, unless somebody shoves their fist in the camera lens, it doesn't work for him.  So it's like, ah, I didn't know about the problem.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Well, Pete from Columbus, Ohio. 
[03:03:30]  Hi, my wife is a special need amateur porn star on imawaterhead.com.  A lot of confessions coming in on the instant feedback.  Keyboard commando from Boston.  OPF had out my wife was Jenna Jameson after being married for four years.  Wow.  Yeah.  Damn, that must have been a surprise.  All right.  And finally, Arnold, of course, gets results. 
[03:04:00]  Of course he does.  So last month, we put the city education department and the school bus company in the hall of shame.  And what do you know?  The next day, the problem was solved.  After the broadcast, everything went the way it was supposed to go.  More buses were added to the route, just as the parents had been requesting.  So instead of having to pick up 17 students all over Queens.  Now they only have 11 kids on the bus, and it's within my area.  The result is Andrea now spends only an hour or so on the bus. 
[03:04:30]  After this, though, yeah.  It came here on time?  Yeah, on time.  Right.  It came here on time.  And did you get to school on time?  Yeah.  In fact, we took these pictures of Andrea's bus arriving at school a few minutes before the 8 o'clock opening bell.  She hasn't been late at all since our report.  She's not missing any classes, which is great.  We're totally pleased.  We're extremely pleased.  I'd like to thank Fox.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Good.  It's our pleasure. 
[03:05:00]  Shame, shame, shame.  We know who their audience is.  Yes, certainly do.  That was a lackluster, shame, shame.  Yeah.  I like the ones where they're confrontational.  The guy tells him to go shit in his hat.  Arnold, go shit in your hat.  All right.  Let's say hi to Paul in Texas.  What's up, Paul?  Hey, boy.  This is Paul.  I got a little story for Patrice, Dean.  He's the man that knows the woman, and I wanted to give a little insight on it. 
[03:05:30]  Okay.  All right.  I dated a girl for a year and a half.  She's 21.  I was 35.  We both come out of bad marriages, right?  Everything was going cool.  I let her get close to my kids.  We decided to move back to Texas, where she's from.  And, you know, she's one of these girls, you know, that told me this, you know, I'll never cheat.  You know, I'm loyal.  I don't lie, blah, blah, blah, blah.  And, you know, I drive a truck, and she was cool with that.  And I came home, it was the 25th, right around the 25th of October, kind of sensed something 
[03:06:00]  was wrong, you know.  And then it seemed all right, you know, she needed a new cell phone, got her new cell phone, go to work, call, say, hey, I'm going to be back this afternoon.  Well, you're supposed to go to California.  Automatically, you know, the alarms go off, right?  Well, all of a sudden, I need the space thing.  And I said, hey, are you seeing somebody?  Let me know.  She says, no, it's not.  Okay.  So I get strung along for a week.  And then all of a sudden, just stuff wasn't adding up.  So being a former Green Beret, I called a friend, got into her cell phone, got a number I didn't recognize,  and actually got a hold of this dude, started talking to him. 
[03:06:30]  And I go, how do you know my girlfriend, Jessica?  He goes, well, she's my girlfriend.  I go, what are you talking about?  He goes, yeah, we've been dating for about a week.  I go, that's funny.  Last weekend, we were sleeping in the same bed together.  I go, she's talking about marriage and babies and stuff.  I go, so I understand.  Well, the reason I was calling it to ask Patrice is once she, you know, she finally I called him, she finally fesses up to it.  All of a sudden, I'm the asshole now.  I'm the one being treated like shit, and I didn't do anything wrong.  And I'm trying to, I want to know from Patrice is that because of the guilt is taking over?  The what? 
[03:07:00]  The guilt?  Because the guilt is taking over.  Is that why all of a sudden I'm the asshole now?  What are you guilty about?  Nah, man.  No, she's saying he's trying to find some kind of saving grace that she's guilty.  Nah, man.  Let me tell you what you didn't do.  You're 35, right?  She's 21.  Your fuck game, you're not going to be able to fuck a young woman so that her body belongs to you.  So you have to have her mind belong to you.  You're not a big dick fuck machine that she needs for her body to be completely under your spell. 
[03:07:30]  You're a middle-aged man now.  You're getting up there.  You don't want to fuck as much.  And you're on the road driving a fucking truck.  But listen, listen, listen, listen, listen.  Your mind ain't right.  You, first of all, she's probably too pretty for you in your mind.  But she's not.  You have to have her think, this is what you do.  You have to have her convinced that her cheating and fucking another guy in some weird way, you're happy about it. 
[03:08:00]  You understand what I'm saying to you?  You have to pretend to be happy about it because she, she's doing that for attention.  Let me tell you something.  Women cannot do anything by themselves.  There's always a reaction to something you did.  You understand?  So this is her little way to go, hey, you're on the road, motherfucker, and you're not paying me no attention.  I'm some hot whatever, and I can get pussy or I can get dick anywhere.  I tell my girl all the time, it ain't no big deal.  Look, my girl could fuck anybody, but I make it seem like it ain't no big deal for you to fuck. 
[03:08:30]  I almost take the sting out of fucking, because fucking for her is not, it's not a fuck, it's easy for her to fuck.  Then why were you keeping tabs on her during our Halloween show?  I wasn't keeping tabs on her.  What Flavor Flaves Posse showed up?  I'll tell you what happened.  Hold on, dude.  I'll tell you what happened.  Oh, this guy won't shut up.  Okay, hold on, hold on.  Shut up, Paul.  Oh, I'm going to tell you something.  I'm going to tell you something, Ovi.  Ask Mars, Masolino.  I'll get up and walk away.  Mas is like a 50-grip black belt or some shit. 
[03:09:00]  He's like, dude, she's been fucking talking to your fucking girl.  I go, calm down, Mas.  Calm down.  Listen, they're doing their job.  They're trying to fuck her.  And this pertains to this dude.  The only way I can keep my girl from fucking Flaves guys is that I'm on her mind.  You understand what I'm saying?  You have to be on her mind like she has to say, it's not worth losing this for maybe the potential better fuck. 
[03:09:30]  Do you understand what I'm saying?  The fuck means nothing to her.  Women, dick means nothing to women.  Do you understand that shit?  It's easy for them to get.  You have to make your knowledge, your guidance, and your slight love.  You give them love like little bits of medicine.  My girl says, you know what I say when my girl says I love you?  I say you should.  Like taking on vitamin every day.  You should.  There you go. 
[03:10:00]  You fucking should.  Because it's not easy.  It's easy.  It's not easy for you to get love.  I'm a pimp.  Except if I don't have bitches on the street.  Right.  Because that's that one little weak part of me where it's like, keep your money if you're fucking it.  You're a pussy.  You treat him like a koala bear.  She was keeping tabs on me because I have, see, let me say this correctly.  I've devised a way.  And you see my girl.  She's a good looking girl, man.  I've devised a way to have her discredit the fact that she can fuck anytime she wants by seeing the way I need. 
[03:10:30]  She knows that a guy has to have no affection, no liking towards her to fuck her.  She knows that in order for me to get pussy, that most of the time, a girl that wants to fuck me feels about me the way she does.  So it's moving in on her territory.  Right.  If a guy fucks her frivolously, it's not moving in on my territory. 
[03:11:00]  That's just you giving up your pussy.  Hey, you're doing me a fucking favor.  Now I can go shop again.  You know what I mean?  I can go open up the human resources department.  That's why I act the way I fucking act.  Do you understand what I'm saying?  So, dude, this is what you did.  You, as a 35-year-old man, you need to give her guidance, man.  Stop trying to catch up to her.  Have her catch up to you.  You are better than her.  You understand?  Think about this.  You're 35 years old.  She's 21.  That's 14 years her senior.  Now, do you think that, what's 14 years? 
[03:11:30]  Eight years old or seven years old?  Do you think a seven-year-old would let a 21-year-old or a 21-year-old would let a seven-year-old dominate her mentally or dominate them?  And you're going to guide a seven-year-old if you're 21, right?  Right.  So, you are still 14 years older than her.  Guide the bitch.  You're not guiding her.  Don't dump her.  She's just goofy.  She's goofy.  I was trying to guide her. 
[03:12:00]  I'm telling you, Patrice, I'm being honest right now.  I was trying to guide her.  And the thing is, it never was about sex.  She just didn't really, she wasn't a sexual person.  She would rather lay down and call.  That was more important to her than sex.  And I was like, okay, but see, I'm a very sexual person.  And, you know, three, four times a night, I want to go where she never wanted to.  And it had always been that way.  And the thing is, you know, I walked away from everything in Virginia to go back with this girl.  And it just came out of the blue.  It was like one minute, it was like, you know. 
[03:12:30]  Yeah, that's, yeah, dude, you, you, let me tell you, let me tell you what you are right now.  You are, if life was a road, you are, you are behind.  You are three cars behind and you, on a, on a dead end, one way street, you're three cars behind and you can't pass her.  You're stuck.  Soon as you said, I'm going to drop everything, which innately makes you unattractive to a woman.  If you drop everything.  You're in a tourist trying to keep up with a sports car.  Yeah. 
[03:13:00]  It's take the next exit, man.  Yeah, man, learn from this, man.  Because, man, I mean, you could turn it around, but it might take more time than, than you need.  Actually, I don't.  Actually, I don't.  And I'm not mad about it because of the fact that she was done that.  I'm not mad about it.  I'm a little hurt about it, but I'm not mad about it.  You know, it's just, I'm going to walk away from it because I look at it as a learning experience.  All right, Paul.  Good luck to you.  All right, buddy.  Good luck, buddy.  All right.  Yeah.  Hey, Doug and Canada, you know, he's got a confession too, and on the answer feedback, Doug writes,  I found out my wife is tub girl. 
[03:13:30]  He's having a problem with tub girl today, so let's say how to Brad in Philly.  Brad, what's up?  Yeah, I just wanted to give Patrice some props, man.  He really knows his women shit, man.  Yeah.  I'm a fat motherfucker in a world where I don't want to date fat bitches, so I got to figure it out.  And I figured it out that women do not, women aren't us.  I am not fucking a woman version of me.  We keep going back to that Halloween show.  Another observation I had.  And everybody at the Opie and Anthony Halloween show was checking up on their women when Flavor Flav and his posse showed up. 
[03:14:00]  Had to.  I never saw more checking up going on.  I don't think so.  Oh, man, what's that happening?  I don't think you was checking up on your girl like that.  You just don't want them to be harassed.  I have no problem admitting it.  Matter of fact.  I did a little more checking up than I usually do.  Well, look.  A little more.  If I'm not mistaken, I came back, and your girl was having the conversation.  I don't know if it was survival technique to have a conversation. 
[03:14:30]  I think even Bonnie, miserable Bonnie, was having conversations.  Your girl was walking around with her fake Marilyn Monroe, or whatever she was trying to be.  Nicole and Nicole Smith.  She felt mighty comfortable.  I'm telling you, no one was, I think more or less, it might have been a safety thing.  If anybody was a little more protective that night, I think it was more, because it's like  if a guy's trying to fuck her, it's just different from a guy harassing your girl, where it's 
[03:15:00]  like, all right, dude, look.  I know I went to the bathroom.  You know she's with me.  You tried.  It didn't work.  Can you not pull her by the side of her face, please?  Yeah, it was more of a harassment thing.  Yeah, can you not grab her draws?  Because she can't defend herself physically.  Yep.  Mentally, I think I got her prepared for you, but, I mean, you want to do beat her up?  Can I interrupt?  Mighty Casey, very bummed today from Mudville.  Oh, my God.  I just realized that horse gag girl is my mom. 
[03:15:30]  Oh, no.  Sorry to hear that.  That's embarrassing.  I don't know what we can tell you today, but.  Was you checking up on your girl a little more at the Halloween party?  A little bit.  Make sure she's all right.  I have no problem admitting that.  Was there ever a moment where you actually was a hairy moment?  Nah, nah, nah, nah.  Randy in Virginia.  It was all good.  She enjoyed your girlfriend a lot.  She's a good girl.  I'm like, oh.  You said that with a surprise, motherfucker?  Yeah, right?  No, because I'm like.  You want to swing?  That's what I'm saying.  And then, like.  Huh?  I fast forward to my. 
[03:16:00]  Huh?  See?  Huh?  How's it swinging, old dog?  Hold on.  Let me explain.  So I fast forward to my head.  I'm like, oh, God.  I'm going to get the uncomfortable phone call from Patrice.  He's like, hey, I was talking to my girl.  And she was talking to your girl.  And, uh.  Can we take her out?  You're sleepy.  That'll be it.  I'll be on a stirring show.  Like, hey.  I'm expecting that phone call from you.  You're just feeling it out just to say, you know. 
[03:16:30]  Fuck.  Oh, shit.  Let's get it, Randy.  And you're probably tired of asking what did you tell her.  Hey, listen.  Don't be talking to this girl.  Next thing you know, you know.  No, she thinks you got it going, man.  She's a good girl.  Yeah, absolutely.  Randy in Virginia.  Randy.  Yeah, man.  I got to give it up to Patrice.  Every time.  Is it me?  Or is it like every time he starts talking about this shit, it's like, man, just shut  the fuck up.  You don't know what you're talking about.  And then at the end, you're so enlightened.  You're like, God damn. 
[03:17:00]  This guy has figured this shit out.  Right?  Yeah.  It's a belief system.  He did.  And it might be wrong.  It might be wrong, but let me tell you something.  If you're a soldier in the army, right, and you are as tough as you think your commander  is, and no matter what the fuck he tell you, if you believe in it and believe in the strategy  and they say, okay, this can't go on now.  I could die, but this is, he knows what the fuck he's talking about.  You'll follow that motherfucker.  That's what women want.  They just want a fucking soldier. 
[03:17:30]  They want to be a soldier and follow the right lieutenant.  They don't want one that goes, uh, I don't know.  You know, they want one that grabs him by the top of their head and says, look, man,  you've got to suck my dick better.  All right, man.  He's got it all figured out, man.  All right.  Amazing.  We're having a good day today.  I don't know how true this is.  Let's say hi to Gene in Chicago.  Gene.  Gene.  What's up with this, Gene?  Gene.  Gene, call.  One moment, please.  Mm-hmm.  Wow. 
[03:18:00]  He's got a secretary.  Oh, yeah.  You know Karen Meyer, the deaf reporter from Chicago?  Yeah.  This is her friend, Gene.  Oh.  And supposedly a friend of Karen Meyer using internet relay service to talk to us.  Oh.  So I think Karen Meyer, who's deaf, wants to say a thing or two.  Oh, right?  About all the, uh, all the stories we've played?  Yeah, I guess. 
[03:18:30]  Okay.  Mm-hmm.  Oh, isn't deaf just a pain in the ass?  And another ding.  Oh, my God.  And another ding.  Did Tracy really go on stern?  That blows what we wanted.  Why are you guys so mean?  Go ahead.  So mean?  Go ahead.  Wait, could someone explain to me what's going on?  Go ahead.  Can you explain?  What the fuck's going on? 
[03:19:00]  Go ahead.  Yeah, I've done this with the police department sometimes when the deaf call.  And, like, basically, you're going to, she's going to translate.  She's going to type it in, hit enter, and then the other chick's going to read it.  And then.  So the chick reading has nothing to do with this phone call.  This is just an operator.  Yeah, she's an intermediary.  Are you an operator, Gene?  Wow, she's not allowed to even talk.  Is she?  No.  Uh, why are we so mean, Anthony?  Over.  Uh, go ahead. 
[03:19:30]  Oh, Jesus.  This stinks.  It takes a while.  Please, God, don't ever let me lose my hearing.  Please.  Can I get, uh, two quarter pounders with cheese, um, no onions, extra pickles, and a small fry?  Go ahead.  Yeah, let's just fuck up the operator.  Go ahead, go ahead.  Uh, Ben, what are you wearing?  Go ahead.  Go ahead.  Go ahead, go ahead.  Mmm, your pussy smells delicious.  Go ahead.  Hello?  Come on, please. 
[03:20:00]  Yes.  Oh, what is that, a two-inch glitters?  Go ahead.  She's typing as fast as she can.  Jeez.  She is a nice lady who has worked so hard to get where she is today.  That is not nice.  I cannot hear this.  It's the only way to communicate.  Oh.  Oh, nice.  So this is, this is Karen.  She said asshole.  You didn't know what she said.  Go ahead.  This is one of Karen's friends, I guess, and she is also deaf. 
[03:20:30]  Is that, uh, right?  Oh, so we're not, oh, friend of Karen.  Wait.  Gene?  Gene's the friend.  Oh, fuck.  We're not even talking to Karen Meyer.  We're talking to her.  It's her friend.  Her dumb deaf friend.  Not dumb.  Just deaf.  Just deaf.  Uh, Gene, okay.  Gene's from Chicago.  She's a friend of Karen Meyer.  She's using internet relay service to talk to us.  All right.  Gene Keller.  Good.  Ow!  Ow!  Ow!  Ow!  Ow!  Ow! 
[03:21:00]  Ow!  Good luck typing that.  Go ahead.  Go ahead.  Go ahead.  Ah, ah, ah, ah.  Ouch, ah, ouch, ouch, ah, ah, ouch.  Go ahead.  Well, Captain Jersey really bummed out today.  Oh, my God.  He's from North Virginia, Anthony.  Damn it.  It's confirmed.  My dad is a size queen on Ghetto Gaggers.  Oh, Ghetto Gaggers.  Oh, dude.  Thank you for saying that. 
[03:21:30]  What?  Is that a good spot?  Oh!  Yeah.  Ghetto Gaggers dot com, baby.  What is Ghetto Gaggers dot com?  I'm telling you, I have never bought a subscription to a site.  Yeah.  You did to that one?  I bought Ghetto Gaggers, dude.  I fucking downloaded every single one.  It's just some corny white guy that goes, hey, honey, have you ever been reamed by, you  ever been throat fucked?  And she's like, nah, uh-uh, all black.  Yeah.  And they just, she just goes, no, I'll do it today. 
[03:22:00]  And they just, some dude, it's a fat dude with a small dick and a, and a, like a messy  dude with a, like a bigger dick.  And he just goes, you ready?  And they go, uh-huh.  And it's just.  A lot of choking and gagging.  It's just horrendously evil.  Wow.  Just a, Ghetto Gaggers.  Like Slap Hacking, but with a white guy and a black girl.  Wow.  Wow.  Oh.  Wow.  Wow.  Wow.  Wow.  Wow.  Wow.  Wow.  Wow.  Wow.  Wow.  Wow.  Wow.  Wow.  Over.  Go ahead. 
[03:22:30]  Go ahead.  Go ahead.  Go ahead.  All right.  Look at that.  Oh, Lord, it's despicable.  Oh, it's just despicable.  I jerked off.  I'm going to tell you why I bought it.  I jerked off to the sample movie.  I never do that.  To the white chick.  I'm Paul R. Nelson.  Go ahead.  It's a light, uh, light girl.  All right.  Oh, here's the sample movie?  Yeah, watch how fast it goes by.  It's like.  I like how the GG and ghetto gaggers. 
[03:23:00]  Oh, yeah.  Okay.  Wow.  Look at the fat mess.  Fat mess.  Oh, he's my hero.  Look at that messy small dick and it's still gagging.  Wow.  Ah, and there's the money shot.  And they leave it there.  It's so degrading.  They leave it there.  But I'm going to tell you something.  If you're watching, you look at porn.  You know, you're not a porn watcher, but let me tell you, man.  Japanese porn dudes.  Yeah.  Japanese porn is the single most sinister porn ever. 
[03:23:30]  That's what Jimmy says.  I watched a porno, and I swear to God, they are creative with their filth, is two things  I saw.  One, a girl, they may fuck with worms.  They just put worms on her, and then some guy fucked her in some worms, and she's just  going, ay, ay, ay.  And he's just fucking the shit out of it.  It's degrading.  I saw you played that on Web Junk.  And then the chair shot up in the air.  Worm fuck.  Worm fuck.  So look at his chink fucking with worms. 
[03:24:00]  And then when I watched these two lactating chicks, two lactating Asian girls, just squirt  each other in the mouth with milk, and one would, they would go, hmm, that's delicious.  And then the other one would squirt her in the mouth, she'd go, and it was serious.  It wasn't anything.  Yeah.  That's my new shit.  No comedy.  Non-sexual sex shit, just, like my girl washing a hooker without sexuality, just like scrubbing  a hooker's underarms and making sure it's clean, just turned me, I lost it. 
[03:24:30]  The boy's seeing her go, no, not ready yet.  You're just getting past the point.  Oh.  You're over the edge, yeah.  But first of all, don't judge me when you work with Norton every day.  I know.  Well, Norton has said that the Jap and the German videos are the worst.  It's like something about being a conquered country.  When you lose a war, you just turn to pornography.  German, I call some German porn.  It's all about shitting and fucking chickens.  Two girls definitively out in public just peeing in each other's mouth at the trolley stop. 
[03:25:00]  The trolley stop.  Yeah.  Das trolley gut.  Pete from Columbus, Ohio.  I'm not sure if this is accurate, but let's try it out.  The clip Patrice is talking about with the worms is on videos.  Hold on.  Yeah, why don't you type that in first before they crash this site, too.  These bastards.  There's too many horny guys that listen to us.  Videos.  Wow, is this updating like crazy today?  I've got to find it. 
[03:25:30]  Hold on there, Thin.  Where the fuck did it go?  Who the what?  What the?  What the?  What the?  Who the?  What the?  What the?  Who the f?  I just lost it.  Maybe someone just plugging their site, though.  Japs fucking worms over.  Videos.  Yeah, go ahead.  Where the fuck did it go?  I'm serious.  I have the URL, but I can't find it.  Oh, my God.  Sorry about that.  I don't know where it is now.  I got it.  I haven't seen the instant feedback update this fast in a long time.  A lot of people on. 
[03:26:00]  A lot of people on today.  All right.  You got it?  What is it?  The URL.  I can't find it.  Oh, okay.  Maybe someone just plugging their site?  It could be.  All right.  If we find it, we'll plug the site.  All right, listen.  Why don't we take a break?  Oh, Charlie, you had something?  Yeah.  Can you please play today's show for best of this weekend?  Because today was better than the rest of the week.  Patrice and Borat rule.  What about Paul R. Nelson?  He was pretty good today.  No, he just doesn't cut it.  Well, no.  It was today in an XM commercial, so we had some of that today. 
[03:26:30]  All right.  Thank you, sir.  I thought we had a real good week of radio.  All right.  Why don't we take a break?  Patrice sitting in for Jim Norton today.  We meant to do this yesterday.  Jimmy is in Atlanta all weekend.  Do we know what club?  Usually the improv.  The punchline?  It's the punchline?  Let me check.  Oh, boy.  How did Jimmy do?  Kill?  Yeah, it's so cool because Jimmy goes around the country almost every Friday and does his  thing, and then we get all the calls Friday morning for his Thursday night show, and yeah,  the reviews were great. 
[03:27:00]  And it's like he's doing reconnaissance for us.  Yeah, it's weird.  He goes, hey, that market's good.  It's catching on.  He's playing the punchline all weekend long in Atlanta, 404-252-5233.  We're going to go to break with Jim Norton on Letterman two nights ago.  Now, we'll do that because we promised this yesterday.  We'll do it on now.  Check this out.  Our next guest is a very funny gentleman, and as a matter of fact, on November 10th,  he will be headlining at the Hammerstein Ballroom as part of the New York Comedy Festival.  Ladies and gentlemen, here's Jim Norton.  Jim Norton.  Thank you. 
[03:27:30]  Nice.  Thank you.  Thanks, everybody.  How are you?  Good.  I actually, I'm really feeling good.  I'm embarking on a new relationship, which is kind of nice.  But do you ever do something to bond with somebody, and it feels right, but when you look back on  it, you kind of feel like a creep?  Like you're in the car, and a song comes on, so you turn the volume way up, and you go, 
[03:28:00]  listen to the words.  Like she's going to hear the song lyrics and kind of identify them with you and learn something  like, hey, I never knew you had the eye of the tiger.  I had to rent a car.  I was in Los Angeles for four months, and I don't have my way around at all.  So I rented a car that had a GPS global position system, which is genius technology.  It's a screen in the dashboard. 
[03:28:30]  You enter the address through a satellite, maps out the route, takes you where you need  to go.  It's brilliant.  I just think there's an option, and it should be there where you enter your race.  This way it knows where it can and cannot take you.  Because apparently my equipment was very young and idealistic, and it's going to be okay 
[03:29:00]  to take me through Compton listening to a Bryan Adams CD.  If you've never driven down Crenshaw Boulevard, nothing says carjack me like summer of 69.  It's interesting.  It's interesting as a white comedian, sometimes when you say the word race, how there was always  a few white people in the audience that are like, oh, we're not with him.  I'm not sure where he's going with this.  Yet, if a black comedian mentions race, the same white people are like, oh, hon, this is 
[03:29:30]  going to be a doozy.  Wonder what we did now.  We are guilty of that.  White people have a very odd guilt complex.  We really do, man.  We really feel bad all the time, and we don't have to.  Most of us don't have to.  All right, look, if you're over 65 and you live in Alabama, okay.  Chances are you owe a few apologies. 
[03:30:00]  And we don't even know we have it most times.  It comes out in very odd social moments, very weird interactions.  Like, you ever accidentally let the door close on someone's face?  Like, if it's another white guy, you're like, oh, excuse me.  But if it's a black guy, you're like, oh, my God, I am so sorry for everything. 
[03:30:30]  Another line of thinking I never understood is homophobia.  I don't understand people who don't like gay people.  And I'm not gay.  I'm not.  I don't think it's fair to judge a person by a few dozen incidents.  I mean, it's late.  I'm in a rest area.  Someone goes, what, am I going to be rude?  What's interesting is most people don't even know they're homophobic. 
[03:31:00]  You ever talk to someone like that?  They say things like, hey, I don't mind gay guys if they don't run over and touch me.  They never do.  I see them every day in New York.  They never just walk up to strangers.  Oh, oh, oh, oh, mullet. 
[03:31:30]  I have a gay friend helping me decorate my apartment, which I know is stereotypical.  But look, I talk to my straight friends.  They're just worthless.  And we had an odd moment.  We were in a furniture store.  And my friend sees a very good-looking blonde-haired guy.  And he tells me the guy's name.  And he goes, we used to work out at the same gym.  I had him in the shower.  And I really wished he wasn't comfortable enough with me to blurt that out.  Yet I still found myself going, what happened? 
[03:32:00]  Thank you guys very much.  Thank you.  We're back, back in the New York room.  We're back, back in the New York room.  Welcome back to the O.P.N. Anthony Show.  Yeah! 
[03:32:30]  O.P.N. Anthony!  It's Last Pet Standing.  Recorded live at FH Riley, hosted by O.P.'s brother Elmo, and featuring some of the least  funny O.P. and Anthony fans, telling some of the most unamusing jokes.  It's awful. 
[03:33:00]  Kiss that insomnia goodbye.  It's an evening of performances by people whose parents think they're really hysterical.  And that's it.  The Unfunny begins this Saturday, November 4th at 9 p.m., only on XM202.  This is Last Pet Standing.  All right.  Well, a woman gets half of her lip waxed off.  So what, motherfucker? 
[03:33:30]  In Holland.  We were just talking about this yesterday with Tara Reid.  When you're getting these things done, you've got to do just a little bit of research.  Well, she just thought she was getting a little hair removed from her lip.  Yeah, but women are doing this every day, and they're not leaving the store with only  half a lip.  Must have been using that rat trap glue that we use.  Yeah.  Yeah, about the girl that went to Mexico and got her ass transplant, and the guy put oil  in her butt.  Regular, like...  Like motor oil?  Motor oil in her butt.  Oh, shit. 
[03:34:00]  As to give her ass a little shake.  Oh, Jesus.  They had to drain her butt cheeks out.  No bullshit.  Change the filter.  No bullshit.  They had to drain motor oil out of butt cheeks.  She went to Mexico and motherfuckers cut two slits in the booty and put motor oil in her  butt cheeks.  Yes.  She's got to go back every 3,000 miles.  Yeah.  They put a little Jiffy Loops sticker when she's got to go back.  And they sewed it up to give it an oily jiggle.  Yeah.  And she almost died, and they had to release oil from her ass. 
[03:34:30]  Exxon.  No bullshit.  Well, that's what happens.  Here's the story.  You've got to do your research is what we're getting at.  A visit to the beauty salon turning into a lawsuit.  A woman claims she got a lip wax that removed more than just hair.  She ended up in the emergency room.  Mercy Ago says hot wax disfigured her.  Ago was a regular customer at the Master Nail Salon in Harlem.  She said the wax was so hot it ripped off part of her upper lip. 
[03:35:00]  The worker applied some ointment and used bandages to alleviate the pain,  but the damage, it was already done.  The public assumes that they know what they're doing,  that they're educated, that they're licensed,  and that when the wax comes off, the hair comes off with it,  and not your skin.  This all happened.  The salon says it is now doing its own investigation.  Mmm.  Ow. 
[03:35:30]  Are penis pumps accredited?  Uh, I don't think so.  Shit.  You use a penis pump?  No, not yet.  You're thinking about it?  I want it.  I want like a 10-incher.  You're not that big, huh?  I'm okay.  It's like, it's not what I want.  I want pain and suffering.  So much for that stereotype, huh?  No, I want...  Mine's just soothing.  Like when I'm poking a bitch with my fingers,  she's like, ah, ah,  and I stop and then put my dick in and it's like, ah.  I have a make-love dick. 
[03:36:00]  I don't have a hurt-your-fucking-rib-cage dick.  That's all we got on the freaking lip lady, I guess.  That's it.  Lipless hoe?  It was, uh, it was visual.  You just gotta do your research.  Yeah, the pictures are horrific.  You got a big, like...  Black lady?  Yeah, and she had one half with still the mustache,  because she only waxed that one half.  And the other half was a big, like...  Oh, you gotta do the other side and make it match.  What the hell?  Yeah, I know.  Unfortunately, it was the first half of a mustache 
[03:36:30]  that ripped off the skin.  Now, my girl had a bad, uh, a bad wax day.  Yeah?  Pucked up.  Where?  Now, uh...  There.  Yeah.  And it didn't destroy her, but it just was like, oh.  And then I said, look, we have pussy day from, uh, once a week.  So I, I shave her with a...  Oh, you do?  You have pussy day?  Pussy day.  Aw.  Where it's very, it's very business-like.  It's like, I, I shave her, shave her, shave her legs,  shave her pussy into whatever shape she wants her hair 
[03:37:00]  when a girl's back, um...  Wait, she doesn't go bald?  She doesn't, uh...  She, I, she likes little, she likes to have a little hair  to do something.  Something.  So I, I, I, I'll shave, I'll, I'll shave like a little...  Is it up to you to, to, to pick the shape?  Yeah, well, maybe a thunderbolt, maybe a fucking, uh,  maybe a heart, maybe a fist, a power fist.  Power, black power.  Black power fist.  And, uh, and then right after, after I, I wipe all the hair off,  I eat a pussy.  So she come, and it's very business-like,  and she, it's very, thank you very much, sir. 
[03:37:30]  Got a hair in your mouth?  And I go downstairs, and...  You don't got hair in your mouth?  It's pussy day.  It doesn't matter.  It's pussy day.  And then go downstairs and play a video game.  I give her, I give her a release.  I give her a happy, happy ending.  You're a good man.  And I go downstairs and play my video game.  She goes to sleep.  Good boy.  People are saying, Patrice, if you didn't have a fat pubis,  you'd have a ten-incher.  A fat pubis.  Oh, the meaty thing?  It...  Have you pushed all that back to see how, how big it would be?  I've done that before. 
[03:38:00]  It's...  Does it add anything?  I've even shaved.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, to give it all shaft.  And trust me, it's...  Look it, man.  It's a...  It's, it's not...  Put it this way.  When I watch porn, I get upset.  Yeah.  I've seen a guy get a double-handed jerk,  and I just almost fainted out of sadness.  I have a fucking good-sized dick,  but I don't want a good-sized dick.  I want this mic stand.  I want to fold it like this.  You want to like the crazy thing? 
[03:38:30]  I want to adjust my dick.  You want to fold it before you go outside.  I watched porn last night.  I couldn't sleep.  It was 2.30 in the morning.  So I said, let me just jerk off and get in a shower afterwards.  So I'm fucking...  I'm watching some oriental gang bang,  all black dudes banging these Asian girls.  Jesus.  And afterwards, they do a thing where they judge the girls,  and they go, what do you give her, man?  And they go, like, 10.  And I give her a 5.  I give her a 7.  And dudes are standing there after the aftermath.  Yeah.  And some of the guys' dicks are so big 
[03:39:00]  that where it would stick out and then hang down,  some of those dudes,  the sticking out, hang down part,  where the dick starts to bend,  that part, before it hangs down,  is bigger than my dick.  Is a full dick.  Is a full other dick.  And it bugs me.  That's got to suck.  It bugs me.  Filled up, it's decent.  Like I said, if my dick was in Vietnam,  some dudes' dicks can kill a whole village. 
[03:39:30]  Come in, everybody's dead.  My dick crawls around in the bushes with a knife in his mouth.  Might take out our fuck.  Cut your throat and then hide back in the forest.  Hey, with that, let's go to Mike in Canada.  Hey, Patrice, thank you so much, Patrice.  You give me a lot of great advice.  I used to think you were just a prick,  but now I know you speak the truth.  I do the same thing with my wife's pussy,  but I just got to call you out  and ask you what a thunderbolt looks like. 
[03:40:00]  It's, you know, you just,  you got to wait until the hair grows a little bit.  You start in front of the cliff,  and you just go up.  What he's getting at, it's a lightning bolt.  You know a lightning bolt, maybe?  You said thunderbolt.  Oh, well, they have that in cartoons.  They say that shit in cartoons.  It's thunderbolt.  You bastard.  All right.  Picky.  That's how dumb I am.  I just fucking,  I would have been sitting there going,  uh-huh, yes.  And?  And he would have said thunderbolt.  I would have been like,  uh-huh, Lord of Jesus. 
[03:40:30]  Lord and Lord, thunderbolt.  What's wrong with thunderbolt, son?  Let's get to one of the big stories of the day.  This is just a wonderful story.  Boy, that lightning was loud.  We heard about this today,  and we have a procedure in our church  for an independent board to come in  whenever there's allegations of a problem,  and then they do a thorough...  But this isn't the actual story, unfortunately?  That's a thorough investigation.  Is it the, are they talking to the dude?  They're talking to the dude, yeah.  That got caught?  Yeah.  And now he had to quit?  Yes.  All right, the story goes,  the president of the National Association of Evangelicals. 
[03:41:00]  Evangelical.  An outspoken opponent of gay marriage  has given up his post  while a church panel investigates allegations  he paid a man for sex.  It's the post that was up his ass.  God, Jesus.  The Rev Ted Haggard resigned  as president of the 30 million member association Thursday  after being accused of paying the man  for monthly trysts over the past three years.  I guess once a month for three years.  Haggard, a married father of five, 
[03:41:30]  denied the allegations,  but also stepped aside  as head of his 14,000 member New Life Church  pending an investigation.  I am voluntarily stepping aside from leadership  so that the overseer process  can be allowed to proceed with integrity,  he said in a statement.  I hope to be able to discuss the matter in more detail  at a later date.  In the interim,  I will seek both spiritual advice and guidance.  And I guess they got to interview him on CNN this morning.  We heard about this today 
[03:42:00]  and we have a procedure in our church  for an independent board to come in  whenever there's allegations of a problem  and then they do a thorough independent investigation  and they have the authority to fire me  or discipline me or to exonerate me.  And so they've received a phone call already  and they'll be coming in  and talking about this  and investigating it  and deciding what they need to do.  So they've already started that process?  We started that process tonight  when we got the word.  I received the word this afternoon 
[03:42:30]  that there were questions rising  and my name had been mentioned in Denver.  And so actually it was your calls tonight  that confirmed that I was the one  he was going to talk about tomorrow morning  and make the allegations against.  And so we have a system for that.  Did you see if it wasn't?  It's totally independent of the church.  It's a group of men that will come in  and meet with the person making the allegations  and then do the research  and then discipline me if I need to be disciplined,  fire me if I need to be fired, 
[03:43:00]  or exonerate me.  Nah, he's hoping for the discipline.  Sounds like he's looking forward to it.  He's hoping for the discipline.  Discipline.  I can only imagine what kind of discipline  they have at that church.  Old-fashioned hoods and awe, chanting.  A lot of candles lit.  Wooden paddle.  Yeah.  Robes with hoods.  Damn.  Fraternity paddles.  Yeah.  Looping bad boy.  And then a reporter asked if he knows any gay men.  Do you know Mike Jones?  No, I do not know Mike Jones. 
[03:43:30]  Do you know any gay men in Denver?  Well, we pastor a church with 14,000 people.  And so I know a lot of men and women.  And I don't know that I know any gay men in Denver.  However, there could be people that come to the church  that are gay men or whatever that I know  that I don't know are gay men.  Have you had a relationship with?  I have not.  Oh, boy.  Oh, no.  You have. 
[03:44:00]  Yeah.  That sounded a little...  I've studied speech and...  Gay men that I didn't know were gay men  that sometimes were gay  that I was with at the church  but not with with  because they're gay men.  First of all, the voice a little gay.  Does he have a gay voice a little bit?  Second of all, he answers a question  before the question is...  I already got an answer.  Officially asked.  He answers it poorly.  He answers way too fast.  That's someone that is like...  Or whatever that I know 
[03:44:30]  that I don't know are gay men.  Have you had a relationship with?  I have not.  Have you had a relationship with?  I have not.  I've never had a gay relationship with anybody.  And I'm steady with my wife.  I'm faithful to my wife.  And so I don't know if this is election year politics 
[03:45:00]  or if this has to do with the marriage amendment  or what it is.  But I'm not even the guy that will investigate it  or question it.  I don't know what the dynamics are.  But this independent group will come in and do that.  All right.  Well, good luck to you.  I guess what happened,  the guy that was servicing him...  Yeah.  ...just had it with this guy saying  that he was against all this gay stuff,  gay marriage.  Right. 
[03:45:30]  And he finally had it.  What a hypocrite.  You kidding me?  All right.  I'm going to pop you right out of the closet.  Yeah, he's calling me once a...  What did he say?  Once a week or something like that?  Once a month.  Once a month?  What is this?  Press nine to hear more options.  Press zero.  To replay this message, press four.  What happened?  Patrice's message.  Is it me?  It's pussy day.  Today.  Today's pussy day?  Today's pussy day.  Oh.  Wait a minute.  Did she just call you?  Press four.  It's pussy day. 
[03:46:00]  Is she listening?  It's pussy day.  No, she just is...  She just is reminding you that it's pussy day.  What shape are you going for today, Patrice?  It's pussy day.  It's pussy day.  Just in case you didn't believe, Patrice.  You believe everything you said.  Patrice, don't lie.  What shape are you going for today?  I think I'm going to do a heart.  Aw.  That's romantical.  I'm going to do a small heart on a cooch. 
[03:46:30]  Then eat it and go play video games.  Video games.  All right, Angel.  Does she just lay there all sleepy and stuff when you're done playing video games?  Angel.  Yeah, she's like out, down for the count.  Took care of her.  Done.  Angel.  Hello.  Hi, Angel.  Hi.  How's Ohio?  Oh, pretty good.  I just wanted to ask Patrice if he was interested in swinging with me and my husband.  We're full swap. 
[03:47:00]  You know what?  Wait.  What's full swap?  I fuck her and her husband fucks my girl.  But there's other options?  I thought if you swing, it's...  Well, swinging could be, you know, it could be two girls a guy.  That's all swinging.  But a full swap is, that's, you, I, you know, I fuck her and her husband fucks my girl.  And what are you just doing in the same room and...  Well, yeah, and it's not just like, eh, ready, set, and...  Fuck.  It's like, I start with her, with my girl. 
[03:47:30]  He does this thing with his woman and they kind of show each other, we kind of show what  we do with each other.  And then as soon as, you know, everybody's feeling like, hmm, this is getting hot.  And I like what you do to your girl and I like what...  Reach over.  And you go, and action.  And then it's like, you know, and then we both kind of are looking at each other and see  what you're doing to each other's girl and see what you're doing to each other's guy  and shit.  And then you kind of get into each other and shit.  You size each other up.  You size each other.  Make sure that there's no code that he's finger popping me too hard or he's sucking something 
[03:48:00]  I don't want to be sucking.  It's like, you look in and once your girl's comfortable and his girl's comfortable, you  know, everybody's comfortable, then you can go at it.  And then you can add your own little touch to the whole thing.  Do you say that though?  Do you go, ah, it's cuck bigger than mine.  God damn it.  He's got a big cuck.  Because we swung one time and the guy had a decent sized jammy.  And my girl went at it.  But I was cool because she was into the dude.  You know, she was like, the dude was, you know, she liked him and she liked, you know, 
[03:48:30]  he was eating a pussy, right?  She didn't give me no, uh, help me looks, you know, and, um, you've gotten the help  me look.  Yeah.  With motherfuckers that come in and try to like pimp, like, okay, fucked up swingers,  uh, motherfuckers that come in and one of the dudes tries to finagle it.  So he's fucking your girl and you not fucking his girl.  So he's trying to direct you on what to do to his girl.  It's a weird thing.  If you get an asshole, but see real swingers are good people, real respectful, real, you 
[03:49:00]  know, Hey, look, I don't, I ain't trying to do nothing funny with your girl.  I mean, I know I'm fucking him.  I got two questions.  No jealousy ever.  Not, nah, not there because it's, it's like, I don't get the mentality, man.  You know, it's, I would be out of my mind.  It's hot, man.  But, but see, you're, you're, I don't know how long y'all been together, but there will  be a time where you go, what's swinging is.  It's just somebody else into your, your person. 
[03:49:30]  Like if you get a little bored, if you get a little bit taken, like you take for granted  the situation to watch another person pleasing your, your, your, your, your, your woman and  she's watching another chick being like, she's saying, yeah, she like for a guy, it's more  like, damn, this guy finds my girl hot.  And I like that for a woman.  It's like, oh, my man can fuck.  Like I thought he could.  Cause this bitch is into him.  You know what I'm saying?  Listen to her.  Listen to her.  Oh yeah.  Angel knows.  Here's the other question. 
[03:50:00]  Uh, do you worry when you're in one of these situations and this guy is really turning on  your woman to the point where she wants to now leave you for him?  No.  Oh hell.  That's not how it does.  Nah, it's not.  It's like, you want that to happen.  I have no clue.  It's like, you, you just, you, yeah, you just want, especially cause swingers probably most of the  time during their own personal sex life are animals.  You know what I'm saying?  Me and my girl, when we have a real session, man, we're just despicable people.  So it's like you, you, it's normal fucking when you're swinging. 
[03:50:30]  It ain't what you do at home.  Cause if you swing and you're not regular fucking at home, you understand?  You're not doing no missionary and she's not going yay.  And, and she, you, you, you know, she's being choked.  She's being peed on.  She's being tied up.  And now it's like, Hey, let's do a little swapping thing.  Cause you know, and that's what swingers swing is a despicable anyway.  In terms, but I say that in good, good terms.  And, and, and, and you just all, the only thing bad is if you get an asshole, if you get 
[03:51:00]  like a girl that you like the guy might come, this is another thing.  A guy might come with a bitch that ain't his girl.  I thought he kept saying when you get asshole, when you get an asshole, when you get a fucking  dickhead, right?  I'm thinking not a dickhead, but when you get a, wait, wait, when you get a jerk, no, not  a jerk.  We sure do use a lot of sexual terms for idiots.  Somebody's foolish.  The first time you said it, I swear to God, I'm thinking, you know, when you get an asshole,  I mean, that's like a very rare thing. 
[03:51:30]  That's where they draw the line.  If y'all not into each other, if y'all not into each other as much as, like if she's  into me, but my girl ain't into him, it's, it's, it's, it's ugly.  Or if he brings a girl that he pretends to be his girlfriend, but it's not, so it's just  some hope.  It's just some bitch.  It's not good.  It has to be too, but swingers are good people.  That's what happens.  Swingers are good people.  All right.  All right.  Enough of that.  Angel.  So you guys want in?  Uh, yeah. 
[03:52:00]  Full swap?  Patrice?  I can't, I can't just say full swap right now.  And another thing, you know what happened, Angel?  I'm going to be honest with you.  My girl is, is, is almost 51%, 49% in favor of women.  She's.  Oh, I am.  And women too.  And we, I, I don't know about your husband or your man, but I hate balls.  And, and my girls do, my girl does.  We hate balls, Angel.  I, I, I just hate it.  And it's not that it's a jealousy thing. 
[03:52:30]  It's just some other ball.  I, I have trouble with another pair of balls in there because I'm, I'm an intimate dude.  Like I'm, I'm into, I'm, uh, you know, I'm, I want two girls to lick my nipples.  I want fucking one sitting on my face and one riding me.  I, I don't, I just don't really want another guy's balls.  And I don't blame him if he don't want my ball.  I'm a mess.  I don't want to be around some other dude naked.  Well, you know, you're honest and that's the way to be.  You're honest about what you want. 
[03:53:00]  All right, Angel.  A girlfriend.  We're letting her go.  Yeah.  We're letting her go.  Well, I don't know.  What you looking like, pumpkin puss?  I have, um, have you ever heard of swing lifestyle?  I thought she was going to mention a disease.  I have, um, scoliosis and psoriasis.  Where are you at?  I have a profile.  I have a profile, uh, if you want to see it.  Yeah, but you have to be logged in and all that shit.  You have to be logged in and stuff.  If Jimmy, if Jimmy was here, he'd be eating up this info. 
[03:53:30]  Cause he'd be just like, I'll just, I'll just, you want you to fucking, I'll jerk off and.  You know what?  You sound sexy and she sounds confident.  Cause any, any girl that says, look at my girl and you're how old?  I'm 20.  Oh God.  And I'm.  Are you, are you thinking about breaking up with this motherfucker at all in the near future?  I hate to, I hate to cut block him, but I just.  Just a mere child.  Yeah, 20.  That's so delicious.  And my girl's a predator too.  She'd be, I don't.  I'll be 21 in a couple of weeks and we can go celebrate my birthday. 
[03:54:00]  Let's see if we all like each other.  All right.  Oh, delicious.  Let's give us some illegal booze in the next couple of weeks.  Angel, hold on the line.  Okay.  They want to give you a prize.  Yeah, that's it.  They want to give you a, a John Mellencamp TV for that call today.  Yeah.  Please hold on the line.  20 you.  For your Burger King coupons. 
[03:54:30]  Did you, did you have a fucking other guy's girl while he just watched you?  No, no.  Mm-mm.  No.  Nah, he'd have to be because my girl would have to be there.  So she had to be involved.  Never.  Yeah.  Your girl would have to be.  Is there a reason you're asking this?  No, actually years ago when I was like 21 and I went to a swing club back in the day.  Let me tell you something.  Civil servants are the dirtiest.  Cops are the filthiest sons of bitches you ever see.  Fucking Keith the cop swings now.  Oh, he's, but he's a cop, you know, he can't say it. 
[03:55:00]  Look at, look at Keith, look at his eyes.  You're telling me Keith don't do some evil shit?  He's an officer of the law, my friend.  That's right.  I know he can't admit it.  He's a respectful man.  Here's what I'm saying.  These are, these are called allegations.  See, you are, you are alleging.  I am alleging.  You are alleging.  That said Keith is a nasty woman.  That's a strong allegation.  Oh, Jesus.  All right, listen.  I have to kill you because you saw me.  Put that away.  DJ, you know, light bulb from post horrors. 
[03:55:30]  I've never heard someone say, I hate balls that casually.  Holy shit, I'm dying over here.  Yeah.  Hey, Patrice, when are you going to do another Black Phillip show?  Let us see.  How about December?  December.  First week of December.  Why that late?  Oh, you're fucking out of town for the next week.  We're going to figure it out.  All right.  We'll figure it out off air because everyone's asking.  Because now the questions are coming in about swinging.  And this is what Patrice would do on a show.  Oh, yeah.  Tim in North Carolina.  Yeah, I want to hear Paul R. Nielsen.  Please play it for me. 
[03:56:00]  Oh, shit.  All right.  We'll end the show with that today.  I promised him.  One last time.  Paul R. Nielsen remix.  The election is around the corner.  Ryan.  Oh, by the way, if you're just tuning in, make sure you listen to the replay because we did  talk to Paul R. Nielsen.  Yeah, the real Paul R. Nielsen.  Yes, we did do that.  Ryan.  What's up?  Yeah.  Hey.  Hey, how's it going, guys?  What's up?  Hey, man.  Hey, I had a question for Patrice.  Me and my wife were wanting to get into swinging.  I must say, first, congratulations, man. 
[03:56:30]  Both have the American dream.  Women like to have their cake and eat it, too.  But how do you...  What's a good way to get into swinging?  Go to a swing club.  And then you meet somebody who's deep in the game, and then they give you...  It's a very secret society.  There's places you can go, but what you want to do your first time is meet an unattractive  old couple that have been doing it forever that you wouldn't want to fuck. 
[03:57:00]  So, like a video game, you got to work your way up.  Yeah, it's levels.  You got to work your way through levels.  The Russian gangsters, then the Chinese ones, and then the fucking boss.  Yeah, you want to figure out how your character moves.  Yeah, you got to figure out.  It's like a training fucking level.  And then you got to push XX up, down, square, square, left, right, Y.  Jesus, triangle, L1, L1.  Can I go immediately?  Yeah, give me the cheat codes right away.  You just meet an old couple, and they'll tell you all the places to go, because the  best ones are, like, at someone's house and stuff like that, because it's a... 
[03:57:30]  Like a swing party?  Yeah, it's really on some old everyone's nice shit.  It ain't like, everybody fuck.  It's just like, hi, how are you?  And wow, she's beautiful, and you're beautiful, and you have blah, blah, blah.  And you have to have a lovely home here.  Serious, that's it, man.  You just have to learn from better swingers how to really get into it.  And don't go on, like, fucking, Iloveyou.com and no shit like that.  It's bullshit.  All right? 
[03:58:00]  We should go with that bitch.  I bring this time.  You like some...  Wonderful.  Is that a Chippendale chair?  That you got?  Because I remember, well, me and my husband had gotten one.  A Chippendale chair!  And it was just the most lovely...  Don't come on the chair.  Let me give you a tour of the house.  Tour of the house first.  Yeah.  You don't want to just jump in and start fucking. 
[03:58:30]  It's got to be kind of...  Nah, it ain't like Rome, nigga.  It's like, hi, how are you, spaghetti?  Right.  You know?  Boy, that meatball looks good going down your throat.  And then, you know.  All right.  Hey, another mission for the pests.  Yes.  Go on Howard Stern's websites and ask why Howard is advertising on our show all day long today.  Oh, is that what happened?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Do you remember, like, Tom came running in?  Yeah.  Because we got word that Howard's, like, running commercials on our show. 
[03:59:00]  If we suck so bad, why is he using our show to promote his shit?  Yeah.  Why would you pick a show that has no listeners?  I forgot to mention this when it happened, because then the show was just flying by with  Borat and everything else that was going on.  Yeah, we had a lot of shit going on.  So Tom ran in and said he's taking care of the problem in New York.  Well, it wasn't taken care of in Washington, Philly, Boston, and every other station we were  on earlier this morning.  Howard using our air to promote his shit.  Yeah, whatever.  Take their money.  But has no problem, you know. 
[03:59:30]  So it's their money.  Saying how much we suck and how much we've failed in the last two years.  Yeah.  So why don't you go and ask why he needed to do that today?  Do you think they go around and say, what are the least popular radio shows?  Book all those.  Let's buy those.  The ones that don't have any listeners.  Or do you think they sit around and go, who really has the big audience?  Do you think they do all that?  And it just shows that he's full of shit.  Of course.  That's where I'm getting at.  Of course. 
[04:00:00]  You won't hear us advertising on his show.  No.  That's for sure.  Well, we would do it as a goof just to get under his skin, probably.  I don't think he's doing it to get under our skin.  He's just that desperate.  Yeah.  See how we spin things?  That's what's happening.  Are we ready for line of the day?  It's the goddamn truth.  Line of the day?  Oh, boy.  Everyone wants to know where they can see Patrice.  He's going to be at the Helium Comedy Club in Philly sometime.  No. 
[04:00:30]  The 17th, 18th.  You got it all figured out.  Yes.  You usually come in here with a very vague plug.  What's today's date, Dan?  November 3rd.  Okay.  Two weeks from today?  Not November 10th.  Oh, boy.  Right now they're thinking November 10th now.  No.  Not November.  So, we got November, that Thursday, November 15th, 16th, and 17th.  No.  November 16th.  Oh, my God.  Listen to me.  No, no, no.  Listen, listen.  Don't go nowhere.  November.  Erase.  Wait, wait, wait.  Erase.  Erase everything they just heard. 
[04:01:00]  November 16th.  Which is a Thursday.  Which is a Thursday.  17th, which is a Friday.  And 18th.  Which is a Monday.  Which is a Sunday.  And that is at the Helium Comedy Club in Philadelphia, PA.  Right.  The Helium Comedy Club in Philadelphia, PA.  All right.  We got a guy calling from Philly.  It's Jim.  What's up, Jim?  Hey there, Jim.  15th, 16th, 20th.  Okay.  Guys, no worries.  No worries.  Patrice, when you come down to Philly, we'll have to hook you up. 
[04:01:30]  I actually DJ at one of the clubs, and we'll have to get you and your girl in for nothing.  Well, thank you, sir.  Appreciate that.  Bring it down.  Have a good time.  Thanks, man.  It's a good time.  Interesting, always.  Oh.  Thank you.  Thank you, sir.  Let's say hi to Kenny in Jersey.  Kenny?  Yes.  Today, I learned from Patrice that he doesn't mind eating chickens, because chickens live  a chicken-y life.  Can you believe you said that? 
[04:02:00]  Like, they're not chickens all walking around being chickens and shit.  They don't lead a chicken-y life.  They just bong, bong, bong, so they die and shit.  Run up the ramp, run down the ramp.  Nick in Ohio.  Peck, peck.  Nick?  Repeat.  Hey, what's going on, guys?  Hey.  Well, I had something else, but now that you're switching on lines, I think line of the day  would be Patrice O'Neal.  I learned that his dick is running through the woods in Vietnam with a knife in his mouth.  That was a great line.  Yes.  But he spelt it out perfectly with that analogy. 
[04:02:30]  That's a great line.  All right, punch it out, guys.  It's all about being able to communicate.  The guy wants to know if you've ever been to a key party.  I've never heard of that.  That might be above my knowledge.  It's so old school.  That's old school swinger.  You know a key party?  It's like one of those things that used to be like in Playboy magazine back in the old  days.  You come in, you put your keys in a big hat or a bucket or something, and then they would  pull the keys out, and whatever key you got was what couple you went with.  That's pretty fucking cool.  The key party.  That certainly, I haven't been up to that.  But those haven't been around since fucking, you know.  But that would be cool because that would be certainly exclusive. 
[04:03:00]  Jerry Lewis and Dean Martin.  That would be super exclusive.  That would be just like everybody there would want to fuck each other.  Right.  You don't know who you're getting.  Yeah, that would be cool.  All right.  So they all better be good.  Let's get into line of the day.  You don't want to get the keys to an old Rambler.  What the fuck is this?  That's a Ferrari keys.  Line of the day.  Sponsored by BodogFight.com.  Log on and watch American fighters battle for the right to represent the U.S. in a bout  against the Russians.  It's all on BodogFight.com.  A mixed martial arts tournament and docu-reality unlike any scene.  B4, we got two runner-up lines of the day. 
[04:03:30]  Two runner-ups.  Two runner-ups.  Here's the first runner-up line of the day.  And I eat a 14 hamburger and 2,000 packets of this red soup that's called ketchup.  And now this morning, after what just happened, my anus, it hanged loose like a mouth of a tired dog.  He killed.  How is that funny? 
[04:04:00]  We didn't know how to handle him.  We weren't sure how to handle him, I should say.  But he made it real easy.  Let him rock, man.  All right.  Here's the other runner-up line of the day.  My anus.  A lot of women have been talking about your film and saying that it doesn't show them in the best light.  Thank you very much.  That's it.  That's good.  That was funny.  I like taking photographs of women making toilets.  Making toilets.  Or making the toilet, right?  Making the toilet, yes. 
[04:04:30]  I don't know what he said.  Best he just say it.  I'm going to congratulate Patrice O'Neill.  I think you got line of the day.  Oh.  Here it is.  Line of the day.  I don't know.  I'm just guessing.  Jimmy's song gets cut off again.  That was professional.  I was going to talk up to the singing.  All right.  Just play it.  If my dick was in Vietnam, some dude's dicks can kill a whole village. 
[04:05:00]  Come in.  Everybody's dead.  My dick crawls around in the bushes with a knife in his mouth.  Might take that off.  That is a great line.  Wow.  You guys pulled that one fast.  Yeah.  No kidding.  You beat Al Borat.  Helium Comedy Club.  Patrice O'Neill.  Yeah.  The 16th, 17th, and 18th. 
[04:05:30]  I got it.  I got it.  November 16th, 17th.  October 52nd.  The second of taste.  And what?  You got it.  Yeah.  Comedy Cave in Calgary, Canada.  Oh, cut the shit.  The Comedy Cave?  In Calgary.  Calgary, Canada.  I killed him in Cucamonga.  From the Lumberjacks, I guess.  The 7th through the 12th.  See, you prove we're not friends.  Mics are just about to be turned off and you're already out the door. 
[04:06:00]  Patrice has to leave before we're done.  He's already up.  I understand.  I didn't even see him out on the sidewalk making a call.  It's pussy day, though, so I don't know.  Oh, pussy day.  Get the hell out of here.  It is pussy day.  He's got to leave early.  He's got to go to like a stationary store and get all those things and figure out what  shape he wants.  What are they called?  Yeah, boss.  Yeah, I got to leave early.  That Johnson account is going to have to wait.  Yeah, pussy day.  You understand, boss, right?  Boss understands. 
[04:06:30]  I thought it was done.  Who's not going to give you a sick day for pussy day?  Secretary, could you run to the store and get a card?  It's pussy day.  Thank you.  Get me the read file.  Pussy day.  What else can you say when it's pussy day?  Trim it up for it and make it look nice.  If I'm going to complain about it being a hairy mess, I got to be willing to do something. 
[04:07:00]  You are a good man.  Hey, good man.  We're off for a couple of days.  Oh, yeah?  Yeah, the boss is over at the other place not happy, but the XM boss is very happy because  they know we've been working really hard.  I'm going up to Rochester.  Rochester.  The next show we do will be Wednesday.  Wow.  What are you doing in Rochester?  It's my mentor's birthday.  Brother Weez.  Brother Weez.  I met him in Montreal.  He's amazing.  Brother Weez is, I think he's turning the big 6-0.  Jesus.  Maybe he doesn't want me to announce that. 
[04:07:30]  I think he's making believe he's 50.  He's like a grizzly old dude.  Yeah, he's great.  So there's a whole thing going on up there.  A roast and a charity event and all that.  And, you know, it's important to me.  So I'm going to be gone for a couple of days.  He's in Montreal.  He goes, oh, I know, man.  Get him over here.  Get him out of here.  I sat down.  He goes, yeah.  All right, get out of here.  The interview was, yeah, I don't give a fuck.  I'm out of here, man.  I got to go.  He truly is the man. 
[04:08:00]  So I wish him a happy birthday.  He works for 96 WCMF in Rochester.  He's 96?  Nah.  Oh, he works.  Okay.  I think it's the big 6-0.  Yeah, happy birthday, Brother Weezer.  All right.  So we'll see you guys on Wednesday, okay?  Yes, see you Wednesday.  Have a great long weekend.  And we'll talk soon.  Oh, s***.  The virus is out.  Tell your friends.  He's infected.  That's right, O.P.  Take that.  You f***ing shut your mouth.  I love the homoerotic nature of the whole event. 
[04:08:30]  The virus made my genitals rot off.  Whoa, dude, don't come near me.  We're your celebrity skin cancer connection.  And it was better than my first kiss.  Oh, laugh until your inner just fell out on the chair.  Anthony Show.  Oh.  Oh, my God.  What?  Line of the Day is brought to you by Bodog.
