<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast began with a scathing attack on Howard Stern and his new satellite radio channel, mocking its launch with 24 hours of fart noises.  The hosts, Opie and Anthony, along with Jim Norton, also self-deprecatingly ridiculed their own channel name, "High Voltage."  This transitioned into a crude and offensive discussion surrounding a terrorist threat to the New York City subway system, punctuated by listener calls offering equally offensive slogans based on racial profiling and news reports about the threat.  One caller from Florida recounted a bizarre story about a python bursting after consuming an alligator.

Adam Carolla then joined the show, discussing his ADD diagnosis and the resulting inflamed testicles as a side effect of his medication.  The conversation returned to Sirius Satellite Radio, focusing on allegations of inflated subscriber numbers compared to XM, with a contentious phone call with a harassing listener, "Joe Shareholder," dominating a significant portion of this segment.  The hosts vehemently demanded he cease his harassing emails, employing offensive language.  A caller, George from Colorado, further corroborated the claims of Sirius inflating its numbers by detailing the difference in activation processes between Sirius and XM free trial subscriptions offered through car manufacturers.  Opie also bragged about receiving perks and payments from XM, contrasting with his lack of benefits from Sirius.

The show continued with listener calls, including Jeff from San Francisco, a long-time fan accessing the show online.  The hosts then discussed Jim Norton's return and segued into a humorous anecdote about a robbery during a sexual encounter in Prospect Park, Brooklyn.  This led to a comedic bit.  Audio of Rob Bartlett impersonating Brian Wilson on the Imus show while wearing an Opie and Anthony shirt was played.  The hosts also discussed their "Assault on the Media" contest, with several callers sharing their experiences, including one caller, Corey, who described being shoved by a cameraman.  The segment concluded with a review of listener-submitted movie trailers for an Opie and Anthony-themed movie contest, highlighting a particularly bad submission. The absurd news coverage of the subway threat was contrasted with other absurd news segments, including a wacky weatherman dressed as Christopher Columbus.

Al Jorgensen (Ministry) then recounted a story about setting fire to their tour bus with a large firework.  Following this, Jennifer W., a contestant fired from *The Apprentice*, was interviewed about her team's disastrous technology expo for senior citizens, which included cake and cookies.  Opie and Anthony discussed the show, highlighting the seniors' lack of interest in technology and the humorous struggles of the contestants.  Callers then shared their experiences working in nursing homes, detailing the grim realities of the work.  This unexpectedly transitioned into a discussion about bowel movements, culminating in a proposed on-air "dump contest."

The show continued with a graphic discussion of a "messiest explosive dump" contest in public restrooms. Adult film stars Jessie Jane and Carmen LeVonna were then introduced to promote their new film, "Pirates."  During the interview, Carmen vomited in the studio.  A running gag involved a challenge to listener Danny to expose his bare buttocks on live Fox News coverage of a New York City subway station for $200.  Danny attempted this but failed due to police presence.  Al Jorgensen called in again, recounting further anecdotes, including urinating in a fireplace in New Zealand.  The segment ended with further discussion of the vomiting porn star, the failed buttocks-display attempt, and a clip of Dr. Ruth giving sex advice.

The penultimate segment focused on an upcoming "wiki meeting" to discuss the potential firing of Harry, an employee accused of dishonesty regarding a computer and a matchbook.  Opie called Harry a "lying sack of cunt" and expressed anticipation for his firing during the live broadcast.  The segment also included a humorous side-plot involving an offer of $200 for someone to expose their buttocks on live television.  The hosts ended by teasing the upcoming segment featuring Ron and Fez.

[00:03:00]  Thank you very much.  Very nice. 
[00:03:30]  Shut the fuck up.  You're a fine bunch of bullies, aren't you?  I'm Opie.  I could give a fuck.  I'm Jim Norton and I'm on the radio.  Shut up.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  It's all about fun, fun, fun.  I'd love to spit in your face.  I will fucking kill you.  Shut up, stupid.  I'm just a zelch and I know it.  Who cares?  We're trying to do a fucking radio show.  I know what we're trying to do.  I'm sitting here across from you.  I understand that.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  Despicable ass.  These dummies at work for us.  You guys stink.  Ben looks like a tall baby. 
[00:04:00]  Always laughing in the wrong places.  Ben, where's the quality?  You rock.  Hopefully he's going through a car wash with his mouth open.  And there's Steve.  Steve is a piece of garbage.  And you stink.  You are cordially invited to a robbery rape.  This is family entertainment.  The show is a disaster.  If you have any food, sing it now.  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road.  Let's get the show on the road. 
[00:04:30]  That was me.  Oops.  They're laughing at me around.  Would you have the TV up?  Yeah, I'm watching a little TV.  I thought we had a Cadillac as a sponsor of this program.  I was stunned.  That would be great.  I wanted to be well informed before we started the broadcast.  Yeah.  I'm trying.  Trying harder every day.  Well informed by watching? 
[00:05:00]  Just the news, really.  Is that what we were watching?  We were watching Katie Couric get a, I don't know, a breast exam.  A mammogram.  A breast exam.  She's getting a mammogram.  And they strategically put the camera where you couldn't see her perky little knobs.  It made a good point.  She likes to be poked and probed.  That's like her thing.  Well, her husband died of the ass cancer a few years back.  And she made it a mission to inform people, very noble, of the dangers of certain diseases. 
[00:05:30]  And now she does that by going on her show and getting the pipe.  Things like that.  She got the pipe live on her show.  Prevention is the key.  Right.  Laid down.  They snaked it up her like some plumber.  Just threw it in there and checked her out.  And now she went for a mammogram.  Yeah.  I'm going to have the hose in my ass.  And now Al with the weather.  Yeah.  It's just a little awkward, I would think.  But here's what's happening in your neck of the air.  It works for a fart noise. 
[00:06:00]  Now that's funny.  Let's just do that the whole show.  Now we're changing the name of the channel to Ass 202.  Ass 202.  Because that's funny too.  Just want to make the Howard Stern fans comfortable today.  Check the ratings. 
[00:06:30]  Check how we're doing.  Ow, I can't do that.  I can't do the old school forsting thing anymore.  In the armpits.  You know why?  I used to be good at that.  You're a grown man.  That's disgusting.  Wow, look at the coverage we're getting in the press.  Hey, keep it going. 
[00:07:00]  All day.  This battle is going to be so easy, it's not even funny.  Wow.  It's not even funny.  Howard, you have nothing.  You don't have what it takes to go to satellite radio.  You know that, right?  You absolutely know that now.  He had, what, nine, ten months to figure out what to get on his channel over there at the  Little Doggy Company.  At least.  He's not allowed to broadcast for another three months or so.  And the first noises you hear on his channel is 24 hours of farts.  Mm-hmm.  24 hours of farts. 
[00:07:30]  At everything.  Of farts.  That's really clever.  And funny.  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.  And you call your channel...  Get it!  There's farts!  You call your channel Douche 100.  I mean, you know something?  Ben brought up this point.  That just goes to show you how childlike it is,  how easy it is to make this point that even a child like Ben can understand it.  He said, it's ridiculous.  The guy is in his 50s. 
[00:08:00]  And the fart noise is occasional.  Of course, farts are funny.  I mean, that's for sure.  I think it transcends age.  Fart equals funny, you're right.  In the right context and circumstance.  But when it's just farting over and over and over and over and over.  And when that's like your big thing.  Yeah, you had nine or ten months.  Ten months.  To make your first impression and that's what you got?  That's all you got?  Something that a third grader could come up with?  People were, I think, hoping for a little better.  The big, you know, that's the big debut of the channel. 
[00:08:30]  Satellite, Stern.  There it is.  you know have something that reflects the new medium the ability to do things you it kind of  kind of it's a it's almost a new start to his career you know it's still radio but it's different  it's satellite radio he is older he can probably make a little line between that part of his career  and this new part of his career that he is in his 50s you know and and it's just the more of the  same just well he'll have to just keep listening to us and figure out how this thing works he has no 
[00:09:00]  idea what he's getting himself into the satellite radio thing is a lot different you're going to  have to give him a little more than farts you think management over there behind closed doors  they're going like holy oh my god we're paying him all this money and half a billion dollars let's  listen and this is what he's got this is the this is the clever way he's going to introduce himself  to satellite radio 24 hours of farting it's a half a billion dollars we paid him turn on the radio  all right is there still time to stop the check money well spent you know management over there 
[00:09:30]  is gone uh-uh hey pass please call howard this morning and tell him that we're laughing at him  openly he needs to know because we know we're getting under his skin big time yeah big fucking  time jeez you'll see in time he'll prove that he has nothing to give as far as satellite radio goes  nothing keep up your good nature absolutely nothing and he's already bitching about the new company and 
[00:10:00]  stuff and complaining and blah blah blah blah blah yeah already it's just going to be more of the same  more of the same and that same hasn't been very good of late that's pretty uh creative though got to  give it to him at douche 100 huh high voltage doesn't sound so shitty after all oh listen we hate the name  of this channel we said it i mean you know in the beginning we didn't have eric logan and some lawyer 
[00:10:30]  came up with the name of the station that's a fact you know all i know is i got a phone call just  before the press conference going back uh over a year ago now and she's like you guys uh we need a  name for the station and when someone says that to me i'm thinking okay well time to start thinking  time to turn on the creative juices get everyone together and bring everyone together we'll  brainstorm we'll figure out a great name for this channel i didn't know i had an hour she shows up  at the press conference she goes you got a name like uh no don't we have a day or two uh no we need  to tell the press right now no we're thinking high voltage what do you think yeah what uh okay we'll run

[00:22:30]  as word spreads of a specific threat against the city subways i didn't hear about the subway threat and my mom  called me about an hour ago and she's like to say up subways for the next couple days police commissioner ray kelly told commuters officers will be out in force over the next few days  anyone carrying a bag or even pushing a baby stroller  is likely to be searched by the department asked the public to curtail the use of these items  if possible in the transit system 
[00:23:00]  additional bag searches and other measures are being taken to provide  added protection to the city subways  buses and ferries mayor  i don't get these press conferences they're saying if you're gonna if you're gonna have a baby stroller in the subway or a backpack you're gonna be searched right yeah  or a briefcase now or a briefcase okay do they think al-qaeda is that stupid where they're not kind of  watching the news listening to the news and and now that they hear that wouldn't they like adjust  yeah take the bomb out of the briefcase 
[00:23:30]  when they adjust their plan at that point once they put it in the guy's shoes remember that yeah that didn't work well that wily coyote attempt  but i'm like why are we playing  exploding fucking shoes this is like playing poker at yeah with all your cards you know face up  and still trying to win the hand right you know what i mean it's like why are we tell it why are we telling  the terrorists basically we're on to you we know you're gonna use strollers and briefcases and backpacks right  i'm thinking about i'm al-qaeda at that point like okay well now we got to figure out another way to bring the bomb into plan b 
[00:24:00]  plan b anthony exactly we all learned about plan b put it in something else i don't get this i don't get how we just broadcast this shit for everybody  well now they're going to be searching guys with briefcase and you know if if there's things uh  you uh you don't want on on a subway when you're going to work it's a briefcase i can just see all these lawyers and wall street types or whoever is uh  taking this subway to work with just legal pads and books all falling out of their arm 
[00:24:30]  rap like the little rascals  the old books around strapping and  slingshot is back pocket  here's more uh...  buses and ferries mayor bloomberg takes the threat seriously but also told commuters not to be frightened  all right the subway to work later this morning i'm going to do what i always do  get on the train and go to work  and i know a lot of other new yorkers will do exactly the same thing 
[00:25:00]  you're going to have the officers conducting the searches and we know uniformed and undercover officers will be riding along the trains with you as well  well it's nice to see the mayor is going to be taking the subway i just hope uh... four point seven million people can get on that car with him  because that's being dubbed the safest car in the country right you think the mayor is just you know i'm gonna hop on this one  or do you think it's swept  beforehand 
[00:25:30]  i want to see the mayor gets searched like with a backpack  yeah it's random  yeah it's random isn't it  yeah he's got a briefcase doesn't he  sure he won't be leaving the briefcase at home  i love that fake shit too  you know your leaders uh... well i'm gonna ride the subway so follow my lead  here we go  and all you tv crews make sure you don't uh... you know film all the security that uh... i have with me  yeah  by the way don't ask any questions about the subway i'm on  which is just a little different than the one everyone else will be on  isn't it illegal to have cameras in the subway shut up i'm the mayor 
[00:26:00]  the mayor sanctioned this  like that's supposed to help i mean are people out there really dumb  yes  are they that stupid where all suddenly they see the mayor riding the subway and then like  oh see  it's safe  i feel safer now  i can get on the train  if he is on the subway then i certainly could be on the subway today  is that the logic of that  forget about terrorism for a minute  has there ever been even petty theft on the same car the mayor has been on 
[00:26:30]  like even the smallest little crime  has anyone ever spit or put their foot up on a seat to get a ticket while the mayor is in that car  there's not even been a singing homeless guy in the car with the mayor  of course not  all right we got  ladies and gentlemen i don't mean to bother you but get him  yeah  shoot the guy  we got some slogans coming in  ben in north dakota  ben what's up  i got a rhyme for you  yeah  if they're brown pat them down  if they're brown pat them down  very good  wonderful saying 
[00:27:00]  uh-uh  sir  we got a trucker  this could be scary  billy go ahead  billy  hey  billy billy  billy billy billy billy  billy the truck driver  come on billy  biggie  biggie billy  billy  you slogan  if there's a rag on their head  oh  hey you talking to me  yeah  what's your name  dave  haha  danny  jesus danny  danny  i sometimes understand if we're saying billy  we're saying billy  and it's willy 
[00:27:30]  yeah and his name's willy  or something  what  dan  dave  no dave  dave all right dave go ahead  dan is close to dave  yeah dave the trucker go ahead  hey if there's a rag on their head make sure they're dead  oh  guns  everybody should have a gun and then they wouldn't be so apt to uh you know show themselves  yeah that's the archie bunker bill we're trying to pass remember that episode where archie  did that whole thing on hijacking  and uh... he was one of those um... 
[00:28:00]  responders to uh... one of the one of the news guys so they put him on tv and um...  and he starts talking about hijacking and how they should just pass out guns to all the passengers on the planes  uh...  you'd be uh... crazy to pull a rod when the whole  just looked like an idiot  that would work though wouldn't it  sure  let's uh... let's say hi to jim in brooklyn  hey jim  hey what's up boys  what's up  adam you're a great guy and happy birthday  thank you  um... whatcham call it 
[00:28:30]  the cops are all over the subway stations down here in downtown brooklyn  this is a place that normally gets ignored  so you gotta think that they got real credible information and they're thinking that it's down here in brooklyn  they did get some info and it was brooklyn because that's where the real police presence uh... is  but they're all over manhattan too  why can't they tell us what it is  because it will compromise the security of this great country  but then we'll decide at that point if we want to take the subway or even go to work  yeah 
[00:29:00]  tell us something  when they start using specific threat but they're not telling you what it is that really frustrates me  don't say anything at that point  you know just get the police presence out there and  you know  reports are coming in that this was uh... al-qaeda  uh... prisoners in iraq  that gave this info  yeah this wasn't like a call  this was like they  but it's like if you were a prisoner over there in iraq wouldn't you just be every day  every day  i mean to the point where all the good targets have been used up in a week 
[00:29:30]  where you're like the ball of twine in kansas  giant ball of twine will blow up  god now they're doing close-ups on the opie anthony shirt  msnbc  imis  bartlett  the brian wilson character is back on with imis today  rob bartlett who uh... does a hilarious brian wilson  and he uh... part of the wardrobe is wearing one of my brother's opie anthony spread the virus t-shirts  jesus  who's the hole in there today  i have no idea  are we getting audio of this 
[00:30:00]  alright we're getting audio because a lot of people are calling the show saying imis is helping you guys out once again on msnbc  right on man  uh...  i should wear an imis hat  ah...  i should wear the cowboy hat  the cowboy hat  imis in the morning on it  jim in boston what's up  yeah uh... if they knew who the bombers were or had any idea who they were they wouldn't announce it on fucking television  so like what's the whole point of this announcement  are they just trying to cover their ass in case something happens  yeah  so they can pretend like you know extra police force and all this and that 
[00:30:30]  they're just hoping like coincidentally  the random bombing happens during one of these alerts because the truth of the matter is  you look at the times  look at the uh... the uh... train bombing in spain  in england  look at the nine eleven  these are all attacks that just came from nowhere  exactly  there was no like warnings beforehand  these things are random they pop up out of nowhere  nowhere  and these advanced warnings come and everybody freaks out  couple of days later 
[00:31:00]  there's not as many cops  it's not in the news as much  and the mayor wants  the mayor wants to be well the point is the mayor wants to be re-elected  and if all of a sudden like the subway blows up today and there was no warning  and it's not his fault  yeah  that's what i'm thinking  because at least like  at least if you know god forbid something like that happens  the mayor you know he covered his ass said look  i i warned everybody we did the best we could  we had vigilant  we were vigilant we had the police out there  we were checking the strollers and the backpacks and the briefcases  so hey it was my fault to re-elect me 
[00:31:30]  and i like the connection between al-qaeda  in iraq  now trying to bomb the subways of new york  it brings bush's whole thing together  yeah but didn't we go to iraq so we could fight the terrorists over there and not over here  no we didn't  we went to iraq to uh... get the weapons of mass destruction  oh yeah  and when they weren't there  we went to iraq to free the iraqi people  and then when all these terrorists start pouring in  then we went to iraq to clean up the terrorists that would be here bombing us 
[00:32:00]  there's so far three different reasons we're there  next week there's a news release  iraq causes cancer  yes i heard it does  gotta fight the cancerous threat in iraq  all right  all right thank you  let's uh... try a few more slogans james in san francisco go ahead  hey if it's brown with a rag check it's back  there you go  there you go  john in uh... jersey  hey john 
[00:32:30]  hey how you guys doing  what's up  hey i got uh... i got two let me try the first one  all right  if you see a turban take the suburban  all right  all right  and uh... if the guy's a raghead scream like a faggot  all right  well that doesn't really rhyme  all right  you get the first one of the day sir  and the first one was okay you would have skated  let's say what  you also know you know something  we get we get heat for this all the time  they don't wear turbans  it's not the turban guys 
[00:33:00]  aren't the guys that have been doing this  they're not the muslims  they're the Sikhs  they are the Sikhs  and they are the ones that have just paid dearly  with beatings  they've been dragged out of calves  like  why do you do this  i'm not even  boom boom boom  you fucking turban wearing motherfucker  the guys at the turban  you never see the guy with the turban  bombing anything  did you see muhammad atah  he didn't have a turban  he had a brooks brothers suit on  you see the guy in uh... england 
[00:33:30]  he was wearing a new york t-shirt  a new york turban  he's got a yankees hat  yeah  just like earl  turban is Sikhs they're not bad  not bad  now the guys on the flying carpets  those are the son of a bitch  that's it  curly shoes  that's it  look for curly shoes  big bent knives  right  those are the dangerous guys  guys that run around going  Hassan chop  Hassan chop  if you see a guy by a subway door saying  open septagenarium  open saddle soap 
[00:34:00]  open sarsaparilla  open Saskatchewan  uh...  let's try janger  jason's slogan  go ahead jason  if they stink like Timpy Tom  they probably got a bomb  oh wow  well that's pretty good  okay  that's not bad right  you know regardless  Sikh turban  that there is an odor  that comes from the lack of bathing  you get in a cab man  holy  you ever been in a cab  that is so completely 
[00:34:30]  filled with stench  that you get out like a block later  i've done that  i've gone  you know something  i'll walk  screw it  and i hand him like a buck fifty  and i gotta flee the cab  you know last night  i went to see steven lynch  at town hall  he did great by the way  he was in here a couple days ago  and i was thinking about  or yesterday  huh  or yesterday  was he in yesterday  no the day before  was it the day before  who was in yesterday  we had carl's mancia  and susie  we've had such a great  i am on a day delay  that i cannot get rid of 
[00:35:00]  i can't get rid of it  we've had such a great week of radio  it's all getting confusing  that went so fast  yeah lynch was in like two days ago  he played town hall last night  he killed  he killed  don't they call him the phony mexican lynch  no  no  because i thought he was the phony mexican  the bogus zeke  i was uh... coming home from town hall last night  jumped in a cab right  and i thought of you immediately  because you are a hundred percent right my friend  what what was it  the white cab guys are absolutely insane 
[00:35:30]  yeah you think you want the white cabbie  because you think it's going to be like an episode of taxi  you're going to get rigor  you know you got it's going to be a fun ride  or james tales going to sing to you  yeah  can we go to school together  exactly  for all you people coming to new york to do a little tourist thing  get in a cab with the uh... with the uh... the middle eastern guys  the ones that have the weird last names with no vowels and stuff  those are the guys that do the  do the job properly  they don't talk to you because they can barely speak english  most of them are like doctors in there 
[00:36:00]  in in in the country they're from  but decided to give up on that because america's great  out of the radio all you hear is  you hear that and you hear the the bbc  that's never a crossover song those songs  they never really cross up very niche  selena couldn't make that one work  you hear that and you hear uh... yeah the bbc talking about how bad america is 
[00:36:30]  it's amazing  yeah they don't like listening to the news around here  holy shit the world bbc whatever it's called bbc world  that you tune in every once in a while  we just stink  awful  according to that  we stink  we still got a grudge for a couple of hundred years ago  and we kicked their ass  so i get in and it's a white guy  and you know this is his  this is the last job he's got before going into rehab or something  you know this is it for him  and i'm like hey i need to go blah blah  and he's like do you need to go where  huh what 
[00:37:00]  uh... i need to and i give the address again  all right  uh...  okay  that's all he said like uh... all right okay  and he looks like you threw him for a loop  looking around  you get in a cab and has to go somewhere  whoa  wow  and he looks around a little bit  kind of like has crazy eyes right  and then just takes off like a bat out of hell  just takes off  i'll get you to your destiny  maybe it is like  yeah  but you got the crazy 
[00:37:30]  i get this thing up to eighty eight miles an hour  you're gonna see some serious shit  though one thing i noticed about the crazy white cab drivers also  they're the only ones crazy enough  a lot of them don't have the bulletproof class partition  oh they don't need it  a lot of the other  this is open right there put the gun in my head go ahead shoot me  oh they want to lie better off  right lives then they're looking to be shot in the head  holy crap  i once tried uh... to start some small talk  oh no  with another white cab guy 
[00:38:00]  that was listening to  i wish i could tell you it was like a really bad movie from the eighties  the soundtrack of that movie  ah interesting  and he's cranking it up and singing all the songs  songs i've never heard of in my life  and i've been you know on the radio since i was like eighteen  i've played almost every song  in my in my career right  you like desperately seeking susan  and i  and i'm i go hey  oh this is what it was  because it was so weird to me  i'm like hey what are you listening to you  what are you listening to right 
[00:38:30]  as he's cranking up the tunes and driving down broadway  he goes none of your business  oh  like it's kind of my business  because you're cranking it up  yeah i'm here  i'm in the same space as you  isn't it our time  yeah at this point it's our cab  because you're cranking the music  sorry that i'm inquiring into your  none of your business  into your musical tastes sir  yeah  but i couldn't believe it turns around and goes  none of your business  and that's why i said hey  next block is just fine for me  now the tip i would have given you 
[00:39:00]  the amount of that  is none of your business  for the first time  i do pretty well with the cabbies  for the first time i asked for the change back  and everything  yep every cent  oh yeah it was like 420 a game 5  wow  i'll take the 80 cents  i took a cab this morning  because there was a credible threat  and the worst  the worst thing is like  it was a middle eastern guy  and i was like half asleep  and there's no radio  which was great  so i'm just coming up here  and all of a sudden  i doze off a little bit  and he's got the cell phone  and he just speaks 
[00:39:30]  and all of a sudden you hear  oh i know  he's not talking to me  but he's on the cell phone  and you know what  does that mean kill the white guy  or i got one of them  yeah  and but they  yeah they start talking  that terror language  into their cell phones  and you're like  this is just trouble  they could be you know  what's the grocery list honey  i'm coming home soon  and what  but it just sounds like  all right  primary target  i guess  yeah gas  explosives  all the keywords  tell richard to like the shoes  and here's a question i have 
[00:40:00]  can we really translate  what they're saying  yeah  that's gibberish  come on  they have such problems  getting translators  for that language  right  because it's just so  out there  all right let's say hi  to norm in philly  norm  yeah  if it smells like curry  leave in a hurry  very nice  we got more audio  the subway uh... threat  that we're dealing with today  here in new york city  we got a chance to talk  to a bunch of riders  here at 86th street today  and they say 
[00:40:30]  that basically  they didn't have much of a choice  other than to take the subway today  i feel like i have to take the train to get to work  and i don't really have any other options  and i want to go to work  so i'm just gonna go  my parents told me to take a bus  but i decided to go with the normal route  so it didn't really stop me at all  i didn't have very many options  your parents are stupid  i mean i still gotta go to work  i'm not gonna walk to the bronx  so  either way  if it's that big of a threat  shut it down  if not  to me  don't try and scare people  shut it down 
[00:41:00]  oh my god  this is what i would do if i was al qaeda  i would make sure that  that we're aware of this huge threat that's going on  so then everyone goes onto the buses  and then i would go up a few buses  that's no  why are you giving ideas like that  why  i mean that lady with  my parents said take a bus today  because all the attention is on the subways  that's where i think  you know  today is the safest day to go on a subway  in my opinion  yep  always works out that way  i'd worry about the buses today  i'd worry about the little sidewalk cafes 
[00:41:30]  you know  i'm thinking al qaeda  you know  we hate them  but i think they got some intelligence  they're not stupid  i think  and then your parents are saying you know  skip the subway go on a bus  i would tell my kids if i had them  just stay home today  take a sick day  yeah  this is just one of those things though i think  where it's some guy they were interrogating  he goes  yeah  subway  strollers  they may  you know what  because of bush's speech 
[00:42:00]  they're like okay we need something  what do we find  they're gonna blow something  you know what it was  one of these guys that  is being detained  he wanted a piece of apple pie  that's what it is  he wanted a piece of apple pie  you play ball  play ball with us  you know they probably have a nice warm apple pie  right on the windowsill  think they like apple pie  right on the windowsill  you smell that apple pie  give us some info  you get a piece  good stuff  all of a sudden they come up with this  is that Entenmann's  right exactly 
[00:42:30]  that's what's going on here  i will give you information for a fry half a chocolate chip cookie  it's all about dessert  they want a dessert  bring me cannoli  hey i got some info for ya  really  yeah but i want a piece of that apple pie  yeah  that's all it is  we have another subway story  another subway story  well i mean it's a it's a just another variation of what we're playing  yeah  but with a little twist  ah  so let me just play it okay  the twist okay 
[00:43:00]  all right  bill this started in iraq when three insurgents were captured by  american authorities and one of them told the interrogators a story about a plan already in place  he said  the plan  explosives on the new york city subway system  now that plan  is already causing the mayor to ratchet up security  oh no  and tell the computers to watch out  oh you tool  our pests are everywhere  they are everywhere 
[00:43:30]  oh  what an ass  i love it  i love it  i absolutely love it  because they're throwing fear at us  we throw some silliness right back at them  absolutely  and don't tell me they're just doing their jobs  no they're not  you know what would be great  they're jumping on this because they see ratings and fear  yep fear mongers  go fuck yourselves  you know what would be great  if that guy screaming had an arabic accent  oh that guy would have shit himself  ah the bombs are here 
[00:44:00]  loses it  how great is that  the first assault on the media for the month of october everyone  and if you are in new york city today  there will be more live shots than you can imagine outside every subway station  every newscast i've watched so far today shows a subway station and a news person outside of it  yeah i live by union square  it's nuts down by union square  yeah  satellite trucks  it'll be so easy today 
[00:44:30]  to do an assault on the media  this guy i'm looking at the video now  it was channel 7 abc here in new york city  and uh...  the guy's foundry  the guy's jumping up and down like crazy  screaming and yelling  and then the reporter  what's his name joe dolan or something like that  he uh... looks to his right  he looks over like make sure he's ok  he's a professional though  he's really annoyed but uh...  he gets through the story  plowed through it  oh yeah the videos up on foundry music dot com  and opian anthony dot com  he's doing a very serious story 
[00:45:00]  he's walking toward the camera anthony  he's in the subway station  and there's one of our pets  opian anthony xm satellite radio  and then i love how the bloods are ripping us off  they're doing assaults on the media  look at that guy  he just threw up gang signs behind him  that makes it a little special  you got you got one of our pets  very white jumping up and down  screaming opian anthony  anthony and then right after that  you got a black guy walking by  giving gang signs on live  throwing some gang signs up  so i guess we have a leader  as far as the assault on the media contest  for october goes  don't forget we got a mi fi radio

No.  Commonly found in post-op Portuguese transsexuals.  The fun really begins when Ray's wife finds out.  Why is the toilet filled with bloody poo?  Oh, my God.  The bed is full of scabs.  It's hot.  But everything works out in the end.  Sweetie, you're losing so much weight.  I bought you a smaller robe.  Hey, my ex.  Ray, your mother's here.

[00:53:30]  And you're checking out the Opie and Anthony program on XM Satellite Radio.  Roy.  The number one satellite radio company in the world.  Wow.  That's impressive, right?  It's true.  Oh, I hope I'm not making any false statements.  Oh, you know what? 
[00:54:00]  You've really messed me up today, Adam.  I'm sorry.  What did I do?  Well, you moved over, Mike, and now I've got to figure out which Mike.  I don't know.  I've been here for three days.  Weren't you over there, though?  No.  You weren't over there?  No, I wasn't over there.  Help me out.  No.  You've been here three days, right?  Yeah.  You started over there.  I was never there once.  Was he there, Eric?  No.  Gary Hull was there with a guitar.  That was yesterday.  Yeah.  I'm talking about the day before.  The day before, I was right here.  I'm talking about the day before that Anthony thinks was yesterday.  No.  I was right here.

That's the first sign.  Hope.  Nice fucking buzz I got today.  You can't get coffee like that anymore.  What are you doing?  A Vicodin?  No.  What are you doing?  No, I don't do any of that shit.  Coffee?  I got enough craziness in my head.  I don't need to add to it.  Anyway.  I did.  Did I tell you that the ADD, they diagnosed me with ADD?  Oh, yeah?  Yeah.  Halfway through the test, I couldn't focus.  The doctor's like, I think you got it. 
[00:55:00]  Really?  So they put me on that Straterra stuff.  5% of the males that take Straterra may experience inflamed testicles.  Nice.  Now, I've never won the lottery.  I've never gotten a royal fludge in a poker game.  Never got close to getting hit by lightning, I bet.  Hit the Straterra jackpot.  Are you kidding?  I swear to God.  I went back to the doctor.  He's like, Adam, how does the medication seem to be working?  Well, I can focus a little bit better, but I rode my own nuts here. 
[00:55:30]  Oh, no.  Inflamed.  How does something that's supposed to help your mind out inflame your testicle?  I have no idea, but you know what?  I said, if I had a choice between my brain and my balls, I'm taking my balls.  Yeah, of course.  So you went off of that stuff?  I went off of that stuff.  It's bad.  I'll be working at my computer.  Oh, look, a bird.  Hey, you're off.  Yeah.  Something shiny.  Just fucking all over the place.  But that's...  How come there's got to be drugs for that?  I don't know.  Because I just say, that's the Adam I grew up with. 
[00:56:00]  You're talking about something.  Boom, he's off.  He's off.  Directions are off.  Yeah.  You can't get from point A to point B.  I got lost leaving the apartment on a beer run.  You remember that?  Yeah.  And the deli was like one turn.  Yeah.  It was one turn.  He got all confused.  Yeah.  I got lost in the woods.  I'm a mess.  Look at the loons.  And it was raining.  It was like, stay on the path.  Stay on the path. 
[00:56:30]  Stay off the moors.  Stay on the roads.  You were talking about something, though, about making false claims or something there about  XM things.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  I sure wouldn't want to make any false claims like I have in the past.  Wow.  There's somebody now.  Now I just consider this guy a stalker.  This guy's a stalker, an attention whore.  Joe Shareholder.  Joe Shareholder is the name he goes by.  Yeah, he made a huge mistake today, and he will now pay for that. 
[00:57:00]  Ah.  Because now he's sending email and harassing the shit out of us.  And now there's a problem.  And now we take care of that problem.  Now we got a problem.  What did he do?  What did he do today?  Ah, it's a problem, and he'll see.  He made a very, very big mistake this morning.  Look what we do now.  Now you watch and see what we do now.  Ass.  Now you can't leave.  You can't threaten people there, Joe.  Oh.  Sorry.  You just can't do that.  But anyway, go ahead, Anthony.  Yeah, well, on the heels of that, I want to announce 80 million listeners by tomorrow. 
[00:57:30]  Holy shit.  That's what XM is going to have.  80 million by tomorrow.  And that's an official announcement, yes.  Asshat.  I just got a communique, Anthony.  Urgent.

[00:58:00]  The street.  The street is a very, very reputable...  Respected Wall Street site.  Right.  Well, they're on to Sirius and they're bullshit.  Hmm.  They're on to Sirius and they're bullshit.  Joe.  Yes?  You're going to stop emailing me, right?  Um.  No, you're going to stop emailing me, right?  If you don't want me to email you, then I won't email you.  Are you going to stop?  I already wrote back to you and said stop emailing me, right? 
[00:58:30]  Oh, I didn't check my email today.  And you're going to stop emailing me, right?  I'm not going to email you.  You're going to stop emailing me, right?  Hey, sure.  I've got a joke for you.  No, I don't want to hear a joke.  I want to know that you're going to stop emailing me.  I'm giving you a chance, Joe.  Are you going to stop emailing me?  All right, sure.  I have nothing to do with this fucking thing.  And we explained our point.  Enough.  Okay, can I give you my joke now?  Are you going to stop emailing me?  I already said yes. 
[00:59:00]  I would be.  Jesus, how many times do I have to say that?  You sound like the biggest faggot.  You know that, right?  Are you the guy they caught in Prospect Park overnight?  Boys Town.  Are you a regular member of Boys Town?  Very funny.  Can I give my joke before I have to go real quick?  Look, now he wants to contribute material.  Enjoy your 15 minutes because it's about over.  Trust me.  And if you don't stop emailing me, you're going to see that it's over.  You guys had like 14 tests to email me. 
[00:59:30]  You encouraged our listeners to email you.  I'm telling you to stop emailing me.  There's the difference.  Fine.  I'll stop emailing you.  All right.  Is there a reason that Al-Qaeda wants to do this?  Is it because they're tired of those commercials with Jared?  You know, the subway guy?  Nothing?  Don't even give him the car crash.  No.  That's what he wants. 
[01:00:00]  He gets nothing.  Thanks, Joe.  Have a good day.  See, he's somebody who really wants attention.  He wants to be part of the show.  And no.  He got our attention, but it's time to move on.  I believe that was the last appearance.  There was a time a guy named Jim Phillips got our attention.  And then we moved on.  Joe, we're going to move on now.  Enough.  Enough with your bullshit.  No more calls.  No more emails.  It's done.  Because I got a very important communique from Elo today. 
[01:00:30]  Elo.  And he says, you boys are going to love this one.  And it comes from the street, I guess, Anthony.  So you can read this for yourself, because we certainly try not to lie here on the Opie  and Anthony program.  But we're not perfect.  But I think our record is pretty damn good.  You can go to thestreet.com.  On everything, because we're in front of microphones.  We learned the other day.  That's the best thing ever.  You don't need a degree.  You need a microphone.  That's all it takes.  All right.  Sirius Satellite Radio's big numbers have a funny new car smell. 
[01:01:00]  Listen to what they're up to now.  All right.  Sirius added 359,000 new users in the third quarter.  Okay.  Nearly doubling its year ago increase.  All right.  But see, Satellite Radio in general is blowing up.  So, you know, we're doing ridiculous numbers this year.  They're doing much better this year.  It's just the nature of the business.  The growth of the industry itself.  The growth spurt is ridiculous. 
[01:01:30]  Yeah.  It's like the cotton gin.  Yeah.  At first blush, that looks far more impressive than the 48% subscriber growth at Rival XM Satellite Radio.  Uh-huh.  We went up 48% in the third quarter.  Yep.  This third quarter from last third quarter.  So, we're doing very, very well.  Okay.  I read on here, though, Anthony.  But it turns out that not all those new Sirius subscribers are actual people.  Ah.  This is a big deal on Wall Street, by the way. 
[01:02:00]  What we're reading to you right now is going to be a big deal on Wall Street.  Because Sirius, the little doggy company, is misrepresenting what's going on over there.  Uh-huh.  XM and Sirius both count on arrangements with big automakers like Ford and GM to power subscriber gains, right?  Because they're installed and they're on the lots and they're XM ready and all that, right?  Yeah.  Okay.  But where XM waits until a car buyer activates the service to add to its new user tally, all right?  Yeah.  So, they wait for the person that just bought the car to actually want the service and to activate it. 
[01:02:30]  Right.  Okay?  And then we add them to our subscriber total, right?  That makes sense.  That makes sense.  Exactly.  Sirius sometimes starts counting as soon as a car with a factory-installed radio arrives at the dealership.  Let me explain further.  Oh, boy.  What does that mean?  Well, so a number of those freshly minted Sirius subscribers could actually be Chrysler Concords, let's say,  sitting on a dealer's lot somewhere. 
[01:03:00]  And they're counting them as an actual subscriber.  Now...  When no one is in that car yet.  Now, when someone does buy that car, if they subscribe, do they add it again, I wonder?  Who knows?  Observers say that kind of liberal math could be bolstering Sirius' growth, especially now as dealers are receiving a new crop of 2006 models.  So, all the 2006 models are coming out, and they're satellite radio ready.  So, they're going to just count them right off the bat before they even have customers for these cars. 
[01:03:30]  Sirius' practice means the company can call it a sub, even if it's sitting underwater on a dealer's lot in New Orleans,  says one investor who sold Sirius and holds XM.  Satellite radio has gone from a mere cult fascination a few years ago to a hotly contested two-player industry.  XM and Sirius are battling head-to-head to capture the largest share of a potentially massive new consumer market.  Yeah, but it's both.  I mean, it's a listener count, right?  Chryslers don't have ears, so there is nobody listening to it. 
[01:04:00]  Well, Sirius has to, like, juice up their numbers.  I mean, you know, we're kicking their ass.  Yeah, but...  It's a fact.  Enron tried that kind of math, too.  Right.  Well, yeah, but there's no real guidelines, I guess.  I guess it's up to the companies.  But the word listener, if there's nobody listening, you can't count it.  Well, but that's why it's called a sub.  Oh, what?  Exactly.  A sub-scription?  It's a subscription.  It's sitting there.  But there's nobody paying for that subscription.  I know.  I'm with you, Adam.  But they're in deep trouble. 
[01:04:30]  We're kicking their ass, okay?  We're kicking their ass bad, so they've got to juice up these numbers to make the company look better.  But there's nobody in that car listening to the fart sounds.  Well, they're on to them, you know, finally.  The Street has come out with this very long article.  I'm trying to go through it to see if there's anything else here.  Yeah, it's important for people to understand that we have a different way of counting subs.  This is from an XM rep.  I just sunk about two feet in my chair.  We count people who have made an active effort to try the service, not by counting cars on the lots. 
[01:05:00]  I think the XM way seems a bit more accurate than the serious way.  It's people that have subscribed to the service.  How could they just count empty cars?  Because they're just assuming that all these cars are going to sell, and that not only are they going to sell,  that all the people that buy these cars are actually going to turn on the service.  They're going to subscribe.  Completely ridiculous.  They're a bunch of bullshitters over there.  And then they got Howard, you know, yelling, screaming on his commercial radio show, saying they're over 3 million subscribers. 
[01:05:30]  He said that again.  Someone really needs to look into that.  They're not over 3 million subscribers.  So have Joe Stockhol to call him.  Shouldn't you then just count all the radios you have at Best Buy on the shelves?  Yeah.  Circuit City just sitting on the shelves?  Sure, whatever's on the shelves.  However many radios you've pumped out, just count those as subs. 
[01:06:00]  So, you know, there's going to be a lot of talk about this down on Wall Street today.  They're getting away with it, but they're misrepresenting themselves big time.  Big time.  Let's say hi to George in Colorado.  What's up, George?  Hey, morning, boys.  Hey.  Hey, I think I know how serious it's getting away with this.  How?  A lot of the new Chrysler vehicles come with a free one-year subscription to Sirius. 
[01:06:30]  It's already prepaid.  All you have to do is call and activate it.  Yeah, but XM has that also.  But they're not counting that.  No, this is different.  This is being done totally different.  But the way they're doing it is all you have to do is just call Sirius and say, hey, I already have this.  Chrysler already paid for it.  Whereas with the XM one, the XM vehicles are not coming that way.  What do you mean they're not coming that way?  You get free XM.  It's right.  It's already installed in the vehicle.  But you have to, like, if I bought a new GM vehicle, I'd still have to pay for the first year of the subscription. 
[01:07:00]  No, that's not true.  No, they give you, like, six months for free.  Yeah, I don't know exactly the terms, but you definitely get a chance to try out the service.  Yeah, you get some free time.  My nephew got a Honda recently, and it came with XM, and he got to try it out.  I think it was for six months.  I don't want to, you know, misrepresent what Honda's doing.  But basically, he had it for, like, six months or so.  There is a free period of time.  Yeah, there's a free period.  I understand it, but XM's not counting that number. 
[01:07:30]  Sirius is, because Chrysler is telling us.  Oh, XM isn't even counting the free time?  Right.  See?  Wow, that's even less than.  Right.  Yeah.  Well, you know, Sirius is just, they're doing whatever they can to make the numbers look better than they really are.  They're getting their ass handed to them by XM, and this article came out today,  and they're basically saying there's cars on the lot that no one is even in.  And they're counting those cars as people, you know, subscribing to the service.  I think XM's even throwing out a better deal that I got, because I know I bought my Escalade. 
[01:08:00]  I haven't even gotten an XM bill when I bought my Escalade.  So does that mean that anybody can buy an Escalade and get free XM?  Just like me?  I haven't seen a bill from XM.  It's amazing.  All right, George.  Thank you.  All right.  Well, not only that, but this is just based on my personal observation.  It seems to me, based on what I've done, that if you subscribe to XM, they pay you huge amounts of money. 
[01:08:30]  Because I get checks from XM every month or so, and it's for a pretty substantial chunk of cash.  Have you ever got a check from Sirius Radio?  No.  Ha-ha!  I can tell you that.  Ha-ha!  I've never got a check.  Ha-ha!  XM.  Now, again, I'm just speaking from personal experience.  I don't know how many other people this applies to, but they just send me huge chunks of money every month.  Now, let me ask you this, Mr. Q.  Have you ever gotten Yankee tickets from Sirius Radio? 
[01:09:00]  No, I've never, and tonight I have playoff tickets to Yankee.  So, as I see it, XM really is the company to go with.  Of course.  A lot of perks.  I got the U2 ticket, so.  And I bet you get a nice chunk of change every month.  Everyone out there, tell your friends that if you subscribe to XM Satellite Radio, you get free U2 tickets when they come to your town.  Right.  And just millions of dollars.  And just millions of dollars.  And may I say, again, I'm not in your league, Anthony, but Sirius Radio has never plugged one of my dates at Rascals in Montclair. 
[01:09:30]  Oh, see?  Adam Farrar.  See?  So, if you're a comic, an entertainer, you get the XM service, and I think that's part of the deal.  They will plug all of your gigs.  Oh, what a service.  Let's say hi to Jeff.  Jeff, Jeff, what's up?  Hey, how's it going, boys?  What's up, Jeff?  Where are you calling from?  San Francisco.  San Francisco.  Hey, Fat Town.  Check this out.  I've been up all fucking night listening to your reruns, and I finally got you guys live.  I got to sleep because I need to go to work in a couple hours. 
[01:10:00]  But I just wanted to call and say, hey, because I haven't talked to you since 2002.  2002?  Oh, wait.  You're an old fan, and this is the first time hearing us on satellite radio?  Is that what I'm getting at here?  Exactly.  And I've got to fucking get a new email every three days because it's free service and shit.  Well, why don't you actually, see, this is another thing.  There's a lot of people that are just listening to the show for free still.  Online.  Online.  They're doing little trial periods with the online thing.  And then the trial period is over.  They sign up for a new one. 
[01:10:30]  Yeah, they're listening.  For someone else's address.  I mean, yeah.  You guys are getting around the system.  How about you help us out and get a MiFi or something there, Jeff?  Hey, I'd pay for it, but I'm in college.  I can't afford shit.  All right.  Well, we'd rather have you as a listener then.  He has XM, so I'm thinking about scamming on his program.  Well, welcome back there, Jeff.  Thank you very much.  I'm happy to hear you guys.  And fuck, I'm waiting for Norton to come back, too.  I want to hear some of his stuff.  Here's what's going on with Norton.  Norton will be here on Tuesday for a few days, Tuesday through Friday. 
[01:11:00]  And then he goes back out to L.A. to continue filming the HBO series that he's involved with.  Yes, I spoke to the little guy yesterday on my way home.  So it's going to be a great little homecoming when he comes back on Tuesday.  All right, Jeff?  Hey, Jeff, do you have like a boy's town in San Francisco?  What is it called in San Francisco?  It's called San Francisco.  No, I've been to San Francisco.  Oh, you have.  You admit that.  I didn't see the gate thing.  What?  Did you open your eyes when you were there? 
[01:11:30]  Dude, I'm telling you.  There's a section in San Francisco.  What is it called, Jeff?  Castro.  What?  The Castro.  The what?  The Castro.  Oh, the Castro.  Okay.  Yeah.  That's the gay area, right, sir?  That's the gay area.  And the rest of San Francisco is just like any other city, Anthony.  I can't believe that.  I was born and raised to believe you go to San Francisco, you're in deep trouble wherever you walk.  Deep trouble.  That there's a lot of the homosexual community filling up the city. 
[01:12:00]  Just, yeah, looking for you, following you, doing whatever it takes.  They'll pin you down if they have to, God damn it.  But then I went there, and I'm like, it's a beautiful city, and, you know, the gay thing is in one section, and the rest is just...  Just taking you when you get off the plane.  Right.  Welcome to Frisco.  Stay still.  Wow.  Well, there's a park.  What is it?  Prospect Park, Ben?  Prospect Park.  I'm looking for the story.  Page 30?  Page 30. 
[01:12:30]  Ben loves this story.  This story made Ben laugh really hard this morning.  Go to page 30 of your workbooks, people.  Turn to your prayer books to page 30.  And it's Prospect Park in Brooklyn?  Yeah.  Yep.  And there's a section called Boys Town?  Boys Town.  Well, two men were shot and robbed by a gunman clad in dark clothes early yesterday morning in a gay meeting spot in Prospect Park.  Did anyone know about this gay meeting spot?  Anybody?  Ben.  You know about that?  You live in Brooklyn there, Hawk.  You know about the gay meeting spot? 
[01:13:00]  Iraq's a frequent visitor.  Shaking your head.  Good answer.  Good answer.  God, I love how everyone just makes it perfectly clear.  I have no idea where this is.  I never knew it existed.  I don't even know gay people that exist.  People are looking.  Tell William I said hi.  People are looking down, not making eye contact with anyone.  The gunman shot a 29-year-old in the thigh about 5.30 a.m., then pumped a slug into the chest of his 28-year-old companion and swiped a gold chain from his neck.  The men were engaged in a sex act when the trigger-happy thug pounced on them in the wooded veil of cashmere, a gay hangout dubbed Boys Town. 
[01:13:30]  Who dubbed it Boys Town?  You want to meet at Boys Town?  All right.  We go to Prospect Park?  Yeah.  I'll meet you at Boys Town.  You just know.  And if you don't know where it is, just stop because it's at night and it's pretty quiet.  You just stop and, you know, if I could, no pun, but cock your ear and then listen for. 
[01:14:00]  I thought you'd listen for.  There's no business like show.  You think they're playing show tunes?  Sure.  Boys Town?  By a big sperm fountain.  I thought you'd listen for.  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Yeah, engaged in a sex act.  Of course, there's, you know, BJs going on.  That's what's going on in the park.  You think it's the BJ or you think it might be the butt sex? 
[01:14:30]  I think the BJ.  The men were engaged in a sex act.  I'm thinking if you're in the park in the open, you're not ass-sexing it.  No.  You go to a public bathroom for that, maybe a stall.  They go to the bushes, too.  Yeah?  Yeah.  In the bushes for the ass-sex or for the BJs?  For both.  I'm just thinking, gay guys, you walk through the park and it's like, hey, you know.  They're one bush for ass-sex and one bush for BJs.  Give me a blowjob or something.  And then it just, like, happens. 
[01:15:00]  It's paradise.  Some flamer getting mad at you because you're having butt sex where you're supposed to have  the BJs.  Excuse me.  Oral bush.  Okay?  Go to the hiney hedge if you're going to do that.  No ass-sex here in the blowjob bush.  They seem to, boy, it's just paradise, though, if you're a guy and you don't mind man-ass  and the gay lifestyle.  Because you just walk through, if you're walking in Prospect Park and there's a section called  Boys Town, you're going home with a smile on your face because you got your dick sucked. 
[01:15:30]  There you go.  It's just happening.  The crime just north of the zoo.  There's a zoo there, too?  Jesus.  That's wonderful.  They don't believe it's connected.  Yeah, there's no hetero hedge.  To a...  There's no place for a straight guy to go in a park.  ...attack by a ninja-clad assailant about five years ago.  Five men were preyed upon by an attacker dressed in black ninja-like outfit in 2000 slash  they're punched victims, but they never caught him and doesn't seem to be connected. 
[01:16:00]  Any place that gay people congregate is a hotbed for attacks, said Basil Lucas, spokesman for  the Gay and Lesbian Anti-Violence Project.  Who?  People assume Basil Lucas.  People assume...  Could be Basil.  It looks like Basil.  Oh, Basil.  I'm using the English pronunciation.  All right.  People assume that these men are easy targets because they don't think they're going to  report it.  Well, I think they're easy targets because it's kind of hard to fight back when you've 
[01:16:30]  got a cock in your ass.  It's really easy to rob people with dick in mouth or ass.  Yeah.  Because at that point, you've got to, like, both run at the same time, four legs trying  to coordinate with each other.  Like a crab running away from a robbery.  Stick him up.  I am.  Lucas said he knows of other victims robbed and attacked at the Vale of Kashmir. 
[01:17:00]  What the hell is that?  It's the place in the park that is dubbed Boys Town within the past year.  And they call it the Vale of Kashmir?  The Vale of Kashmir.  And you wonder why the gay guys go.  Yeah.  And they were too afraid to report it to the cops.  None of the shooting disturbed park goers enjoying the warm autumn day.  Of course not.  No news of the shooting disturbed park goers.  Oh.  Enjoying the warm.  I thought it was no news.  I figured they were just like, ah, a couple of fags got shot.  Oh, no.  They're deeply disturbed.  Oh, my God.  My heart's just racing, said Joanna Ruiz. 
[01:17:30]  Ruiz.  Ruiz, 35 at Park Slope, as she pushed her newborn through the park yesterday.  I'm completely alarmed.  But I'm going to rethink when I come to the park.  It was 5.30 in the morning this happened.  She's there, what?  Pushing a baby into the park.  No, she wasn't.  Oh, maybe she was there.  No, no, no, no, no.  I'm saying the attack was at 5.30.  Yeah, 5.30.  What do you expect?  They're into the morning sex, those gay guys.  It's just the gay guys that are willing to go to the parks and just give and take any time of day. 
[01:18:00]  It just doesn't matter.  There is some gay fucking going on.  Love the parks, man.  And then some homie just jumps out and decides, hey, this is easy.  This is easy picking.  That is the limping zebra by the water hole, man.  He's got his pants down around his ankles.  He pants it down.  He can't run away fast.  Yo, bro, just hand the money over.  Look, dude, you look ridiculous. 
[01:18:30]  Just give me your gold chain.  Yeah, but you don't have to shoot the guy.  Take the money.  That's all we got.  Be polite about it.  Can I have your wallet?  Okay, boys, finish up.  Yeah.  He's along.  Shot him in the thigh, too.  He's going to be out of commission for a while.  The thigh.  So that's what we got.  We got a subway threat, which is very serious.  We know that.  And Boys Town.  A specific threat.  And then we got Boys Town.  That's what everyone's talking about in New York today.  Good-skilled labor.  Hey, what do you do back in Boys Town?  Hey, we had the guy that did the assault on the media on the line, but he hung up. 
[01:19:00]  So maybe he'll call back.  I know his name if he calls back there.  And also we got the audio of Brian Wilson, a.k.a. Rob Bartlett on Imus.  Yep.  Doing the whole Opie and Anthony thing.  Had the ONA shirt on.  It was great.  Anyone else noticing that Imus is looking like the new nickel?  Is that where they got the picture?  The new nickel, all it needs is the cowboy hat on it. 
[01:19:30]  That's right.  On good old Thomas Jefferson.  It's like one of those separated birth things.  He used to.  This ain't working.  Just occasionally wear the cowboy hat and the cowboy duds, but now it's all the time.  The guy's completely gone.  He's going to show up with guns on the holster.  Six shooters and spurs.  He loves that look.  He's got a new hat and everything.  He's got the denim look today.  Come on, bro, man.  We're stalling because I'm trying to get this done. 
[01:20:00]  Why is this working?  What happened?  It was just weird.  Oh, my God.  I was just listening to CB1.  How funny would it be if Charles McCord showed up dressed like an Indian?  That would be good.  Like a headdress.  They could just have a little fight behind the console.  It's like cowboys and Indians.  All right.  We've got to get another copy of that.  What happened?  I don't know.  I don't know.  All right.  Why don't we...  This would be a good time to take a break.  Yeah, I could use a leak.  We had some good audio of I'm just helping us out once again today. 
[01:20:30]  We'll play that when we get back and some other things.  Stay there.  Like sands through the hourglass, so is the O&A virus.  I'm not as bad as people would think.  I will say that women who have hooked up with me at times, even just regular dates,  are always surprised I'm not completely the creep they expect me to be.  Really?  The ones that live through it.  Very gentlemanly.  Yes.  Very gentlemanly.  Yeah, I'm nice.  I'm a nice fella.  So you get to know them a little.  Yeah.  And you start to sing. 
[01:21:00]  Ooh, that's probably good.  And you start telling them what it would be like if they had to sit and watch you and  her father.  Oh, yeah.  That was a good one.  Snuggling and you jacking the father talk.  Yeah.  And just, and just, he lets it go in my hand.  He puts his face in my neck and goes, and he just groans into my neck as it bubbles over  on my hand.  And he paints these pictures for these girls.  Oh, is that horrific.  I used to love that one and telling her how I was going to hug her grandmother, but then 
[01:21:30]  just grab her grandmother's ass and press my heart on it against the kitchen counter.  Like, into her crotch.  That's what she said, too.  She said the worst part of the whole, like, she'd come down the steps.  And the way I would describe it is that me and her dad would have our pants pulled down  just to mid-thigh.  Like, we wouldn't be naked.  And she said the worst part was the pants not being all the way off and the face in the  neck.  She said that was the worst part. 
[01:22:00]  Oh, the father, you feel his little razor stubble on your neck.  Like, he can't look at me, but it just feels too good to make me stop.  And they'd have to walk around with this image in their head.  Oh, yeah.  That is hysterical.  You're an awful human.  Too good.  Would she laugh at that?  No.  Maybe she's like, ugh.  Yeah.  It was just closer out.  Why?  As soon as I found that out, I couldn't stop. 
[01:22:30]  Every time we saw a family member, I'd think of a new egg.  I'd get sexually accosted them.  Opie and Anthony, the virus is spreading.  There is no you.  There is only me.  There is no you.  There is only me.  There is no fucking you.  There is only me.  There is no fucking you.  There is only me.  All right. 
[01:23:00]  This is the Opie and Anthony program, the Friday edition.  Adam Farrar sitting in for Robert Kelly, who was sitting in for Bill Burr, who was sitting  in for Jim Norton.  Jim Norton returns on Tuesday for a few days.  You try to figure that out at home.  Adam Farrar is going to be at Rascals in Monclerc, New Jersey.  All weekend long.  All weekend long.  Monclerc.  Monclerc.  Does a great, great job up there on the stage.  Monclerc.  On the old stage. 
[01:23:30]  All right.  We got the audio, so we can get right back into this thing.  Sorry about that.  Going into break.  Working now?  I think so, yeah.  Bravo.  Imus is a true friend in the business.  He's helping us out.  He's plugging us when he can on his MSNBC show.  Much appreciated.  He's got Rob Bartlett, who does a very, very funny character, a very funny Brian Wilson  character.  Yeah.  And part of his wardrobe is to wear one of my brothers, Opie and Anthony, spread the virus  t-shirts over like a Hawaiian type shirt, I guess, right? 
[01:24:00]  He calls Imus because he's so confused.  Of course, he calls Imus Opie.  Right.  And today, I guess Imus said something like, I'm not Opie, and Rob, as Brian Wilson said,  well, if you were, you'd have people listening to you, or something like that.  I think we have the audio of it here.  So let's take a listen.  From the Beach Boys, our old friend Brian Wilson.  Good morning, Brian.  Hey, Opie.  Hey, Anthony.  Oh, and it's Barney Brackett, that's your host.  I've got all the mics on.  Why isn't his on? 
[01:24:30]  Try it again.  Take a nine.  Please welcome now to the Imus Morning program, Brian Wilson.  Hi, Brian.  How are they?  Party Rock.  XM 202.  Hey, Opie.  Hey, Anthony.  How good is that, man?  I love those guys.  Goddamn, man.  Awesome.  What's next?  Getting a bunch of bald people named Richard together? 
[01:25:00]  Get them all to wear flesh-colored turtlenecks?  And make a reality show out of that?  What could you call it?  The biggest dick?  Wow.  Hey, Opie.  Hey, Anthony.  Uh-oh.  I think we just...  Oh, I don't play it.  No way.  No way.  Are we taping 11?  Please tell me we're taping 11.  Oh, I hope we were taping 11.  Holy shit.  What was that about?  That's...  I just...  Oh, Jesus.  Uh-oh.  It's an assault on the assault on the media. 
[01:25:30]  Wow.  God damn, that was great.  One.  Line one?  That was live?  Corey, what's going on?  Hey, what's going on?  Was that you we just saw on TV?  Rangers shirt on, sure.  I hate the fucking Rangers.  But I love you.  What did you do?  I stood behind them.  I said, don't want to party rock.  And the cameraman came out and shoved me.  Yeah, we saw the shove.  It was quick.  And the woman looked a little alarmed.  I'm telling you, man.  Today, they're doing live shots all over New York City. 
[01:26:00]  So...  Here's your chance.  Here's your chance to get involved in the assault on the media contest for October.  And we were just ending the whole I miss thing here.  And I looked up at the TV, and I see a guy on a cell phone running right at the reporter  as she's trying to do her thing.  What did you yell?  We're going to have the audio in a minute or two, but...  I yelled, oh, and a party rock.  Oh, and a party rock seems to be the battle cry.  Oh, and a party rock.  You had the cell phone.  I guess we were going to do it live on the show, but we couldn't get to you in time.  And then all of a sudden, out of nowhere, a guy comes out of... 
[01:26:30]  Into the frame and just shoves you really hard.  That guy was Howard Stern.  Yeah.  The cameraman?  Yeah.  Who was it?  That was the cameraman hitting me.  Oh, really?  What?  Oh, he must have had his camera on a tripod then, I guess, huh?  It was Doug Forrest.  That was pretty cool.  It happened pretty quick.  Yeah.  What?  You just saw the camera in your hood there?  No.  Channel 11 and Channel 12 are both out here at the Newark train station.  Dude, they are everywhere.  There is every train station today. 
[01:27:00]  If you want a chance to win this month's Assault on the Media contest, today is the perfect  day.  You don't have to go searching for these people.  You know where they are.  They are at the subways.  I love that they're pests.  Yeah.  Complete.  They see the news guy and kind of like a mosquito on a nice warm summer night.  Here he comes.  Here comes the pest.  That was a perfect example why we call these people pests. 
[01:27:30]  Yeah.  Camera goes live and all of a sudden he's just drawn to the camera.  The reporter's trying to swish him away with his arms.  Get away!  Stop!  Like the flying at cars video.  Danny, what's going on?  Well, I just wanted to stress the importance of having a spotter.  Yeah, because this guy calls in and he says, you know, hey, I see a live crew.  I can't do it, but, you know, if they can tell somebody.  So I'm like, screw it.  Let's do it right now.  Yeah.  So I told them when they were live and it went great.  Yeah, we almost got to do it live on the show. 
[01:28:00]  We just missed that one.  Well, you did great there, Corey.  All right.  Thanks, guys.  Keep it up.  Hey, Oak Islanders suck.  Oh.  You guys don't look that good either.  Very nice.  Well, we won the first game.  No, I thought you guys lost.  No, we won the first one.  Yager's the man.  All right, well.  Did the cameraman say anything to you as he pushed you?  Yeah, what happened after?  Because they cut away real fast.  He didn't really say anything.  I think he was pushing me out of the way.  He thought I was going to touch the girl.  No, no.  The key to this whole thing, guys, I'm serious, is don't touch the reporter. 
[01:28:30]  You can go in front of the reporter.  You can wear a mask, I guess.  I hear you can.  Some people say you can't because there's a law against that, which I don't really understand.  And then our favorites is the ones that are very involved with signs and things like that.  But Corey didn't have a sign made.  He didn't know it was going to happen.  Right.  He just knew he had to do it for the show.  Spur of the moment, one for the team.  Love it.  All right, Corey, we'll have your video up on opianthony.com very shortly.  Thank you.  Awesome.  Thanks, guys.  There he goes.  Corey from Newark.  So we've had two in a matter of hours. 
[01:29:00]  We had one late last night and one this morning.  You got it?  The audio, yeah.  Oh, great.  Because we didn't hear it.  I want to see it because I just saw the end of it.  It was really...  Oh, here it is.  The audio.  State police in Connecticut given the authority now to make arrests on board New York-bound trains.  Again, that specific threat is aimed at New York City's evidence.  We'll send it back to you.  All right.  Thank you so much, Patty.  We got a break. 
[01:29:30]  Oh, and I party rock.  Oh, and I party rock.  He sort of committed.  That was good.  That was good.  You think he was, like, trying to talk himself up and all of a sudden it was go time and all  of a sudden he had the...  He was shaking.  And he was probably like, all right, I'm going to do this.  Oh, and I party rock.  Oh, and I party rock.  Camera rolls.  He jumps in.  Oh, and I party rock.  Oh, and I party rock.  He got all nervous.  All the muscles contract in his throat. 
[01:30:00]  He's...  Oh, and I party rock.  State police in Connecticut given the authority now to make arrests on board New York-bound  trains.  Again, that specific threat is aimed at New York City.  We'll send it back to you.  So excited.  That's a guy that's very nervous and trying to yell at the same time.  Fantastic.  All right.  Right on.  I know the pests did their job today. 
[01:30:30]  There should be ten of these today.  There really should.  Easy.  The opportunity is out there.  Well, they're mobilizing, so we'll see what happens.  The pests are mobilizing, so.  It's the assault on the media contest for October.  And where's the other one that...  We might as well play the other one that came in, because we've got new listeners checking  in.  Yep.  All the time.  This is the early leader on the assault on the media contest for October.  This video is up on opieandethony.com as well.  Bill, this started in Iraq when three insurgents were captured by American authorities, and  one of them told the interrogators a story about a plan already in place, he said, to 
[01:31:00]  plant explosives on the New York City subway system.  Yay!  Now, that plan is already causing the player to ratchet up security and tell commuters to  watch out.  He was smooth, though, man.  He wasn't like Arthur Cheyenne, where he turned around and cursed.  He looked at him like, you son of a bitch, but continued with his report.  Yeah.  I think that was Joe Dolan or something like that from Channel 7.  So, the winner of the assault on the media contest for October will win the MiFi. 
[01:31:30]  Also, what?  A day with Opie and Anthony.  What else, Don?  Probably Gamefly.  Subscription.  Anything else?  The prizes have to get, you know, better.  We're working on it.  The guy just got pushed.  Yeah, the guy just got pushed.  I know.  I saw.  I mean, October, November, December.  Physically assaulted.  At least give him an island of schedule.  These next three months are huge for XM Satellite Radio.  Huge.  So, I'm thinking if we get the prizes a little better, we're going to get even better  assaults, which in turn will get the name out for the show, which will add to the subscriber 
[01:32:00]  base, and everybody wins.  Everybody wins, Don.  Everybody.  Everybody.  So, all right, we'll be adding more prizes, but there's your early leader, and the video's  up on opianthony.com, okay?  We're about to say goodbye to another bit, the movie trailer bit, Anthony.  I'm trying to clean up some business here.  What?  You know, the opianthony movie trailer thing?  All right.  Well, Steve, we should get Steve in here.  These are the last two, I guess. 
[01:32:30]  And then Nathaniel next week is going to give us the top five movie trailers that came in  from the listeners.  Where is Steve?  Here he comes.  Oh, wait.  Let me say hi to Angel in Minnesota.  Angel.  What's up?  I was just going to tell you, did you notice how when she was ending her bit, she sped up  really fast?  Yeah, because she didn't know what was going on?  Yeah.  Exactly.  So, she was freaking out.  So, she was going like this and talking really fast, and then she quit. 
[01:33:00]  The latest one, right?  Yep.  Yep.  All right, now I've got to hear it again.  Yep.  Hold on.  Let's listen to that.  Did she speed up because she just didn't know what the hell was going on?  State police in Connecticut giving the authority now to make arrests on board New York-bound  trains.  Again, that specific threat is aimed at New York City's office.  We'll send it back to you.  Yeah.  Thank you so much, Patty.  We got...  Hey, good pickup, Angel.  Yep, you betcha.  All right, thank you.  You guys rock.  That was really funny.  Yeah, she turned into a speed reader all of a sudden. 
[01:33:30]  I love you guys.  Hey, keep up the good work.  All right, thank you, Angel.  Okay, bye.  That was...  Yeah, that's what happened.  You've got to go in a holding pattern.  All right, and here he comes.  Steve, everybody.  Yeah, what is this guy doing?  This weatherman?  He's wacky.  Why is he in some kind of renaissance fair clothing?  There's probably a renaissance fair going on.  What is going on with that channel?  I don't know.  WB News here and...  And we're supposed to respect what these guys do? 
[01:34:00]  This is the news?  He's just like...  You have Monday off.  Thank my man, Christopher Columbus.  In the meantime, Larry Hoffman's live, hanging out with the beer.  He's supposed to be Columbus.  Ah, he looks just like him.  Hey, I did a big job here.  Linda, this is for you.  Does he come out in blackface in Martin Luther King Day?  Does he do that?  I doubt it.  But he's got to be in that production.  Just like Christopher Columbus.  Columbus Day is...  We're thinking of putting you in a Columbus suit.  Columbus Day is Monday?  Yeah.  I didn't even know.  We don't have off for it, though. 
[01:34:30]  Why not?  We never have off on Columbus Day.  Yeah, but you're going to have to go to the Yankee game Sunday night.  Oh, if it rains...  Let's just take Monday off.  You want to do that?  Steve, what do you got?  We got two movie trailers?  Two movie trailers, and I think this is the end of the bit.  Yeah, but you gave me one that's really bad.  Well, just to show you a contrast.  We got one that was really good.  The production value in the first one is really good.  Would have been nicer if the kid had drops from the actual show,  but he did an honorable job trying to make up for it.  And the second one is just one that's... 
[01:35:00]  Yeah.  Do we want to play the one that he's describing as...  The...  When it's bad production and it goes on for two and a half minutes, that's...  Well, we're not going to get to the end of this.  We could start it and see how it sounds.  Look, if you had one shot or one opportunity  Seize everything you ever wanted  One moment 
[01:35:30]  To capture  Just let it slip  ONA Pictures presents  A Lifetime Channel original movie  A movie about a hole  A gaping hole created by a very fancy man  I'm nuts!  Almost 13 years I'm doing comedy  God, there's no justice  Oh, wow  Wow, thanks, Steve  You're welcome  That sound is...  That was wonderful  Yeah, exactly  Horrific  Now, just as a contrast, we have the first one  Alright, and this was by Joe  Yeah, by Joe  In a world where most rock music sounds the same 
[01:36:00]  And the industry has no place for originality  Do you guys go a little more mainstream and maybe wear some spiky belts?  And it's hard to find an audience looking for something new  Thank you, goodnight!  Four friends from New York come together to form 20 after  Here, and take a stand  Starring 
[01:36:30]  Anthony, the attention whore  Hey, everybody, look at me!  Over here, look at me!  Jim, the ladies' man  Hello?  Wait, who are you and when did we end up?  Joe, the arrogant one  It's not my fault I'm a musical genius  And Jim, the more arrogant-er one  Dude, did you agree with me or am wrong?  It's your choice  When ambition turns to frustration  I cannot sing over this crap!  I wish you were never born  It's not my fault God made me better than you 
[01:37:00]  Guys!  Go borrow some money  Sometimes, help can come from outer space  One band is just you  One desire  But there's four of them  One foursome  Yeah, buddy, I just said that  Whatever  20 after  Now playing on XM Satellite Radio  20afterband.com  Are you getting enough sleep at night?  Did I miss something completely?  Yeah, I got confused  Are you sleeping at this point? 
[01:37:30]  Did I?  Was I phasing out?  What?  Like where?  Where maybe I just didn't understand  No, I just figured it out  Would anyone want to come in and  And giggle?  Help Steve out?  I figured out what it was  Dude, you're getting a lot of shrugs in the other room  They're like, ah...  Yeah  What?  What was that?  What was that?  That was a...  Who was that?  What?  Are you a...  Are you like taking another job on the side?  Are you now a manager for bands? 
[01:38:00]  Moonlighting?  Yeah, I know  Are you a manager of 20 after?  I just went, I just went, I just...  As that aired, I just went, uh-oh  That's a band trailer  What did you think it was?  When I heard Anthony and Jim, I was like, oh, okay  Anthony...  He actually writes, would have been better with actual show drops  Great production, though  And then...  But he meant Anthony and Jim  Right  From this band  Two other guys  Right  Because then there's another Jim  Right, and there's a John and then a Joe 
[01:38:30]  There's a John and a Joe and no Opie  Because it had nothing to do with this show  There's two Jims and Anthony and a Joe  Oh, my God, Steve  Holy shit, Steve  Oh, my goodness, Steve  It's fucking Friday  What kind of...  It's a Prius?  What?  It's a Prius?  Yeah  Your hybrid?  Yeah  Are there studies of fumes that might be...  Coming out of them?  Coming out through the air conditioning system?  Wow  Yeah, that was bad  Well, it was a good trailer  It wasn't just bad 
[01:39:00]  It was...  Irrelevant  It had nothing to do with anything  Nothing to do with what we're doing  Okay  Oh, my dear, Steve, Jesus  Holy shit  Oh, my God  Have you eaten?  Are you hungry?  Do you need a trout to nibble on or something?  A honeypot?  What's the problem, Steve?  They're laughing at you  Yeah, I know  They are all laughing at you  Don't even turn around  The other room is laughing  I know  And they want to help you  They really do want to help you  No, I know they do  The reality...  I'm...  After roughly a hundred of those 
[01:39:30]  I got...  My barometer got completely thrown off  And I...  I'm not even, like, angry  I...  I feel sorry for you  Thank you  I never...  Thank you  I don't like this feeling  You know what?  It's you guys that tell them  To email me this shit  And when you get drowned in diarrhea  After a while  You're just looking for clean air, man  You really can't even defend yourself  I know  I'll tell you why  You didn't listen all the way through  You didn't listen at all  I heard production  And I went  Because this is like  There's supposed to be  Opie and Anthony movie trailers  Right  So the first thing  You want to make sure they are 
[01:40:00]  Is Opie and Anthony movie trailers  Is an Opie and Anthony movie trailer  And that wasn't...  Wow  Yeah  Well, let's say hi to Jared in New Jersey  Hey, Jared, what's up?  Hey, it's Jerry from Jersey  How you doing?  All right, Jerry  Is Steve playing the part of Brian Wilson today?

You have a Ron Reagan one  And you have the marriage one  The marriage one is good  Hold on, hold on 
[01:41:00]  I'm making a phone call  All right  Hi, you've reached the voicemail of Laszlo  I'm not in right now  But leave a message and I'll get right back to you  Hi, Laszlo  Yeah, it's Opie and Anthony  I'm just  What are you doing for lunch today?  Yeah, maybe we could go out to lunch  Discuss some things  I don't want to get into any details  But there could be an opening here on the Opie and Anthony show  And we'd like to talk to you about it 
[01:41:30]  Such a prick  You really are  I have to now pint  I have to now pick through drops  And do something really mean  Wow  Wow  This just didn't  Well, I'll let Joe say it from Tennessee  All right  Go ahead, Joe  Yeah, my guys  I'm going to have to say that  That man is now in the lead  For the assault on the media guy  God, Steve  You got bamboozled  You so got bamboozled  I can't even remember the last time  I used the word bamboozled 
[01:42:00]  Well, you used the word bamboozled  When he got bamboozled  About the shooting  In the Opie  That was the last time you said bamboozled  Wow  Twice in a week  And that seemed like yesterday  It was yesterday  It was like two days ago  Wow, you've had a really weird week  It really is  I've got to think going  You're believing fake videos  And you're hearing things  That are just not there  But you want us to play  The Al Jorgensen bit  Yeah, I'll dig myself  About a quarter of the way  Out of the hole with that one  Is Harry from Ron and Fez's show  Paying you to make him  Look a little better?  Yeah  He's actually asking me 
[01:42:30]  To help him out  With a lot of his production shit  Is that what it is?  Yeah  It's all right  That'll teach him  Wow  Maybe Don could do  A two for one today  That's good  I need my rage pills  Steve  Have you changed anything?  Yeah, really  Diet, medication  You know what it is?  I'll be perfectly honest  Your commute?  Yeah, I think it's  I think it's the house stress  Is really getting to me  Is it?  I think this shit is just  Completely overwhelming  At this point  Yeah  And it is  It's taking its toll  So when I actually get a chance 
[01:43:00]  To sit down  I'm overwhelmed  With like 50 crap pieces  Of production  I'm like  Because that's a complete miss  Steve  I can't stress enough  How you completely missed  That that had nothing to do  With this program  With the project  At hand  I know you were thrown  There was a name  Anthony and Jim  In there  Yeah  I uh  Yeah, that was a miss  So you heard like  Key phrases  Yep, heard key phrases  And went  Okay, that's good  Next  And production  That didn't completely stink

[01:57:30]  We've got to say  Hi to Jennifer W  From The Apprentice  Jennifer  Hi  How are you  I'm doing  Actually better  Yeah you looked  Real sad last night  On The Apprentice  You were the  You were the latest one  To get the boot  And get fired  We don't want to  Really say you're fired  You know but  Yeah  I'm moving on  You're moving on  Yeah you sound  Very happy right now  I am  I actually got to  Finally get some sleep  Well what was the task 
[01:58:00]  Well I mean I watched  The show but for  Everybody else  On The Apprentice  Last night of course  There's two teams  There's the ladies  And the men  They both have a task  And what was  Last night's task  Just to  We were to put on  A technology expo  For Cedar Chase  Which is a  Assisted living  For senior adults  Sponsored by  Best Buy  Yeah  Technology for seniors  By the way  I know it was so funny  One of the guys  Go  Computers are from  The devil  Yeah yeah  By the way 
[01:58:30]  I got to jump in here  Really fast  Because you know  Donald Trump  Coming across like  A really nice guy  During this whole  Apprentice show  How he gives back  To the community  And does this and that  You don't have to  Comment Jennifer W  But it shows that  He's also the devil  Why  Because he  He sends all these  People into the  It's an old age home  And their job  Last night  Was to show people  How to use TiVo  And high definition  TVs and computers  And how to use  Digital cameras  Good luck  And they were 
[01:59:00]  Trying to cover up  Everything last night  But it was obvious  They had no clue  In general  Right Jennifer  You know  Some of them  Knew a little bit  But most of them  Know  And most of them  Don't even want  To touch it  It's like  Eh  Yeah  You know  I don't need that  It's  They're frightened of it  Exactly  They don't want to  Learn something new  That infernal device  Now  What is that  My mom  My mom is 69  She knows how to  Use the VCR  Okay  We bought her  A DVD player recently 
[01:59:30]  We're still trying  To teach her how to  Use it  Because she can't  Get the concept  Of the whole menu thing  She used to just  You know  Push play  Stop  Rewind  Fast forward  That's it  And maybe record  One of her serials  As Anthony likes to call them  The serials  The programs  But you forget  That the DVD  And the technology  Today is a little more involved  And just dumb stuff  About moving around  On a menu  On the first screen  She can't get  By that concept  We've tried to get  My mother  A computer  She totally  Did not want it  Wants no part of it 
[02:00:00]  And we're telling her  You know  It's about email  We could email you  Pictures  Right  Things like that  Like things that  Parents or grandparents  Would love  Here's a picture  Here's a video  With a kid  Here's you know  Things like that  And she just wants  No part of it  At all  No technology  There was one  Sal had gotten her  This camera  With a printer  It's a digital camera  Take the picture  You pop the camera  Into the printer device  And all the pictures  Get printed out 
[02:00:30]  No computer involved  Nothing like that  She was like  Oh I don't know  No send it back  I just  I got my regular camera  And she's got this camera  From like 1976  With a flash cube on it  Like it's back  You know  Ancient technology  That's hilarious  You don't know  How lucky you are  I got my mother  The computer  She figured it out  Every day  I get Dalai Lama email  Oh really  Chain letters  Oh that's the other side  Of it  Oh god  Here comes all the junk mail  But she has time  To read it  And send it on  Yeah  This is good luck  This woman's really sick 
[02:01:00]  That's why I think  Donald Trump  Is a sick individual  Yeah  And he should be  Taken away  Ooh  To put all those  Old people  Through all that  So the women  Basically they lost  Last night  Yeah  We got slaughtered  And Jennifer  Had to pay the price  And she got fired  Now was she  Like a leader  Or  Well Jennifer  I wasn't the project manager  The project manager  Put me in charge  Of what she considered  The event planning  Room set up 
[02:01:30]  Food and beverage  Decor  That kind of thing  Jesus  What you don't know  Is that I was allowed  About $260  For all of it  And another teammate  Felicia  Was in charge  Of the posters  And those didn't get done  Needless to say  Kinko's didn't come through  For us  But anyways  You know  A lot of stuff  Doesn't come out  And  Can I get the  No regrets  No regrets  Well can I  I gotta play a quick clip  From last night's show  Cause you're trying  To defend yourself  Cause it's obvious  That you're in deep trouble  Deep trouble 
[02:02:00]  Because one of  Donald Trump's  Lackeys there  Or whatever  The blonde  I don't even know her name  I'm on Carolyn  Yeah she looks like a real  You know  You know  Oh boy  You know what I'm gonna say  Like instead of the  Last initial being  M it should be C  Right  She  She looks like a real  Anyway  She basically  Saw your presentation  And said there was  Nothing going on  In the presentation  No balloons  Nothing  Oh you're talking  About Carolyn  The blonde  The blonde  That is one of  Donald Trump's  People 
[02:02:30]  Yeah  Oh jeez  See she comes in  She was ruthless  But she looks like a real  You know Jennifer  So basically  Her job is to go  And see how the group  Is doing  And to report back  To Donald  And basically  Look at Jennifer  Like you were in charge  Of making a nice  Presentation here  And there's nothing  Going on  No balloons really  Nothing  So then Jennifer  Tries to defend herself  In this clip  From last night  It's quick Jennifer  Cause I know you have  To leave  Hold on a sec  I think the reason  This task failed  Was because 
[02:03:00]  There was nothing  To this presentation  I thought the place  Was very dry  It was very drab  The food was horrible  And there was nothing  That really drew you in  There was not even a sign  That said  Technology exposition  There was nothing  It was boring  You thought everything  Was fine  The reason why  I picked what I picked  Is I spun off  Of my grandmother  She loved cake  That's why I chose that  I picked cookies  Cause I knew that  Some people  Wouldn't like cake  And they'd probably  Want something easier  And just handheld  And I even had 
[02:03:30]  Sugar free cookies  For the diabetics  I made sure that  I did that  No offense Jennifer  But you're  You're explaining  This to Donald Trump  That you did the best  You can  You got cake  Cookies  I gave the old people  The cookies  Don't make a meaning  I gotta be  I know  What's so funny  Is when she makes  That comment  My answer was  To something that  George has said  Earlier in the border  But of course  The way they edited  And piece it together  Yeah  You know  Oh well  What can I say  I have no control 
[02:04:00]  Over that  You're trying to  Defend yourself  And basically telling  Donald  But I got the cake  And I got the cookies  If they don't want the cake  I got them a little  Handheld snack  Let's say they're diabetic  I even got sugar free  Sugar free  Actually earlier  He was complaining  About the food  He was like  And the cake  And the cookies  And they were stale  And they were hard  And I'm like  Oh my god  Give me a break  You know  You know  In our families  You know  Who we give that job to  Right  Uh oh  The one that's a little  A little slower  Than everybody  Oh  Jesus 
[02:04:30]  Because all you have to do  Is get the cake  And the cookies  What can I do  Just go get some cake  Just go to the bakery  And just  It's under my name  You don't even have to  Pick out the damn thing  You just gotta pick it up  It's all paid for  It's all paid for  The fudgy to whale  Get it  And Jennifer  Before we let you go  I gotta call you out  On something else  Who  Who's the bad speller  In the group  Oh my goodness  Whoever works at that  Grocery store  Shame on me  For not staring at it  Hard enough  And realize that  It wasn't a C  It was a T 
[02:05:00]  But  Yes  Oh well  Live and learn  The cake had  A misspelled word  Oh no  It said techno  Instead of techno expo  Oh well  That was Marshawn's idea  To put the words on there  We should have just left it  Wait it was supposed to be  Techno  But it was what  Tetno  Tetno  Tetno  Who are you  Christopher Columbus  It's a testino festival  The grocery store  Didn't quite get it  But that's okay  It was pretty funny  Though I gotta tell you  Oh I know  And you looked at that blonde 
[02:05:30]  You know  You know what she is  Jennifer  And went  Oh I know  Oh she's going right back  To Donald  I wouldn't want to be  Stranded on a desert island  With her  Let's put it that way  And she's going back  To Donald  To tell him that  You know  I can't spell  Tetno  So what do you do  In your real life  When you're not a TV star  Well I own a real estate company  Overseeing about 80 agents  So that keeps me busy  I also have a restaurant  It's a sushi martini bar  Called Off the Hook  All located in Arizona  Just north of Phoenix 
[02:06:00]  Plus I'm married  And I have two small children  A four year old  And a two year old  So with all that  I'm pretty busy  Wow  Proven that you're  A true brainiac  You opened up a sushi restaurant  In the middle of Arizona  That's wonderful  Hey where do you get  Your fish from  Yeah because  When I'm in Arizona  And in those places  In the country  I'm thinking steak  Yeah  Oh now we have steak too  We have a great filet  With dunganus crab on top  Chicken katsu  But Anthony

And a misspelled cake  Stale cake  And stale little cookies 
[02:08:00]  But this was supposed  This was supposed to be  Her expertise  Where was it done?  See I am a little curious about this  See if you've noticed  The whole gag here  With this Apprentice interview  That we've done last week  And this week  Is Opie actually watched the show  I haven't a clue  So I asked the questions  But now  You've intrigued me a bit  And I'm curious  Let's take people inside  What we do on this program here  All right  Quite frankly  The Apprentice  I can take it or leave it  I'm not going to lie to you  Uh huh  Okay  But you know 
[02:08:30]  This is good for the show  Get some big stars  On the program  Uh huh  So I told the fine folks  In Washington  Look this is what we'll do  I'll watch The Damn Apprentice  Every week  And I'll give it my all  Yes  And Anthony's not going to  Watch it all  I won't watch it a second  And I'll tell you why  And I'll tell you why  Because now you're like  Joe Listener  That didn't see The Apprentice  Last night  Right  So you helped me  Make it interesting  For everybody out there  And I might  Come up with some questions  That they would come up with  So now here's the questions  Yes  Yeah  What do you need to know 
[02:09:00]  See because now  I'm a little intrigued  Thank God for the DVR  By the way  Because I woke up  At five this morning  And watched The Stupid Apprentice  Yeah  You gotta love it  As I'm drinking coffee  You gotta love it  Anyway go ahead  What was the atmosphere  I know it was an old folks home  But all I ever picture of that  Is that  That little meeting room  They have  With the bed furniture  Social room  Whatever they call it  With the plastic school chairs  And some you know  Poor comic that's gotta go up there  And do an act  That's where he does it  And that just 
[02:09:30]  With cheap streamers  And like  Hey learn about technology  How would you make it look good  How would you make something like that  Well the guys you know  They got balloons and stuff  And they just jazzed  Balloons for technology  That's like what you would bring  If you needed to bring technology  To a retard home  It's like an expo though  It's like you know  You wanna make it look  The presentation  We've been to some of these  XM events  They have a good presentation  I don't think I've ever seen balloons  Dude it was  It was really funny though  Because  It had to have been  With old people 
[02:10:00]  That could give a shit  About technology  They don't care  You know what  It was like a dream come true though  Cause all of a sudden  They're going about their day  Just one day  Leads into the next day  Yeah  Time is a bitch  As we all know  But how do you  They're at the end of their lives  Yeah  Waiting for bingo  Hoping for something warm  To eat  Right  Yeah  And all of a sudden  The door opens  And seven or eight women  Hot as shit  Oh they gotta look at this  And one of the women  Was trying out 
[02:10:30]  Like a heart monitor  That you wear on your body  I guess  For exercise  And make sure  Your heart rate's okay  Yeah  So she wants to demonstrate it  The old codger  Has to be in his 80's  Maybe in his 90's  No  And all of a sudden  She gets on the floor  And starts doing push-ups  Right in front of him  Oh  Of course  Cause it makes for great TV  They're right on the old man  And he is basically drooling  Like holy shit  I remember that  I haven't seen that  In a good 50 years  Since the Kaiser  Was there  The guy is losing  His mind  And basically 
[02:11:00]  The old men  Were just flirting  With the women  The whole time  They could care less  About high definition TV  But how do you figure out  Who wins  I mean  At the end  Like if you sell enough money  Whoever makes the most money  Wins  How do you know  I guess in this  I guess  Are they like rats  If grandpa makes it  Through the maze  With this task  They had like  A little questionnaire  That all the old people  Had to fill out  Oh  And based on  And the guys  Had a bigger  Higher rating  Positive responses  Yeah  They had an 8 point something  And the women  Had a 7 point something  What did the guys do  That made them so much better 
[02:11:30]  I was too busy  They put porn on a laptop  To the women  And their hotness  They show the guys  Porn on a laptop  If you eliminate  The female vote  Yeah  And just pad the male vote  And give them laptops  With pornography  That's it  Watch the guy in Seattle  Get killed by the horse cock  Right right  You know  The old guys  Hey this is pretty good stuff  We learn how to change  The angle on the DVD porn  It's wonderful  Thank you Mr. Trump  But the guys  Just drooling over  The hot women  That was  That was the reason  To watch last night  It was fun  Yeah  And they could care less  About digital cameras 
[02:12:00]  They've lived their lives  They don't care  They've got no pictures  They don't care  What they're taking pictures of now  And you can't teach  The old people new tricks  You just can't  Pictures  I can't see  You son of a bitch  I had the unfortunate experience  Of going to go to an old age home  I don't know  I don't know  About six weeks  About six weeks  About six weeks every single day  Why  When my mom was in that accident  With my pops  Oh right  She survived  She's totally fine now  So whatever  But she was in really bad shape  And she was in an old age home  Like a nursing home 
[02:12:30]  Yeah like for six weeks  And I knew the whole time  She was going to be okay  So it was cool  Right  But I was like spending time  Walking around the halls  And stuff  Holy shit  Yeah  Holy mother  It's depressing  Holy crap  Yeah of old women  That are celebrating  Their 90th birthday  And having little like  Little like princess crowns  On their head  Oh my god  And their like  Their great grandson  Is there  You know  Celebrating the 90th birthday  With them 
[02:13:00]  Actually no  The story gets worse  Actually it does get worse  This 90 year old lady  Came up from Florida  And she's still with  She's one of these  You know  We all have one relative  In our family  Where we have to brag about  She's 95  And she still lives alone  Got all her wits to her  She still goes to the grocery store  And does her own shopping  We all tell the story  If you think you're the only one  Shut up now  We all do it  She actually lives  She gets out of bed  And dresses herself  Still every morning  Gets up 
[02:13:30]  Makes herself breakfast  That's wonderful  Goes out  Walks  She can still go to the movies  By herself  There's always that thing  Yeah that's  That one thing  She can still do  That a three year old  Can do  Right  It can roll over  She's reached a point  She's ahead of schedule  On rolling over  We put her on our back  She rolls over and crawls  She's 95  And doesn't need to put her food  In a blender  Right  So there was this lady  From Florida  She's coming up to  Celebrate her 90th birthday  With her son 
[02:14:00]  Who doesn't have time for her  That was obvious  Of course  You know  But mom  90  All right  I'll throw her a bone  And throw her a party  For a couple days  And a real rich guy  Right  And she's hanging out  At his house  And she falls  And breaks her hip  Death sentence  So now she's in the old age home  She came up from Florida  For her 90th birthday  And she was totally with it  I talked to her a few times  Oh no  Really nice lady by the way  I don't mean to  You know  Trash her  But that's what happens  And instead of having  The nice party  I think the guy  Has a really big house  On the water 
[02:14:30]  She's in this horrendous  Horror show  Celebrating her 90th birthday  With a cake  As you hear the noises  From the other room  And then  Shut up  The oxygen  Oh yeah  The whole deal man  The whole deal  My grandmother was  She was 90  Oh god  92  She had one leg  A bad eye  She's like one of those  Crazy Muslims  That are all deformed  Screaming  She was all beat up  You know  And it's just 
[02:15:00]  It was  You know  And she was fighting  She's like  She had everything wrong  With her  Every system was shutting down  Everything was wrong  She wouldn't go  She was like a dodge dart  You couldn't kill her  But you know  She finally  You know  Even my father said  You know  This is just no way to live  Just come on  There's no dignity  And then  My grandmother  When she finally passed away  Her last words were  Fucking finally  Is that true  She actually said  I just want to go  Anyway  Just to finish up 
[02:15:30]  So you know  I was coming and going  Every day right  And there was one lady  That was just the one  That just  It just proves  You do have a soul  You have a soul  And have a heart  Did something touch you?  Not even  It just  Freaked me out  Like I'd be walking by  And she would be in like  A wheelchair  With the  The kindergarten tray on top  You know  And all of a sudden  You're just trying to walk by  I'm dealing with my own 
[02:16:00]  Like you know  Horrific scene  Oh no  And I just want to see my mom  Give her some flowers  Give her some encouraging words  Do my thing  You need a little dose of reality  Along the way  Right  And as I'm walking by  This lady  Every  Almost every time  Well when she wasn't sedated  There were times  She was just staring into space  But when she wasn't sedated  She's alive and well  Not alive and well  She's got some  She talks to herself  The whole deal  Yeah  And as I'm walking by  She's like  Help me  Help me  Help me  And if that's not bad enough 
[02:16:30]  She grabs on  With that old lady strength  The old lady strength  The bony fingers  Now all their strength  Goes to those little  Translucent bony fingers  That you can see her pulse in  Now she's grabbing on to me  Screaming  Help me  Help me  Help me  Why'd you get close to her?  The hallways  That's where they hang out  They don't want to be in their room  So you go down the hall  And it's just horrific scenes  All around you  On the left  On the right  You don't know  You're waving  You're saying hi  You're doing what you can 
[02:17:00]  Oh no  And she grabs  Blinders  And then the people that work there  At this point  They've seen it all  Oh they don't care at all  They're just screaming at her  Like whatever her name is  Mrs. Smith  Let him go  Just screaming  And I'm like  It's okay  It's okay  No it's not okay  Let him go  And just she's screaming  Help me  Help me  Help me  And I'm dragging her down the hall  Because you know  The wheelchair is  Get off me  Old bag  You didn't even stop  You just kept walking  Keep walking  She's on wheels  Who cares  No the first time 
[02:17:30]  The first time I stopped  And I  Help you with what?  Right  Yeah  Sounds like a logical question  And then you know  It had something to do with Martians  And the mold people  I don't know  And then  Yeah  Then it got to a point  You just try to keep moving forward  It's just what it's like in those places  And the wheelchair is moving with you  I did a job once  When I was doing air conditioning  In one of those old folks homes  And there was a man in a wheelchair  And all he did  The whole day  He sat there  In one spot  Just going  Help 
[02:18:00]  Help  Yelling it  I guess that's what they do  Help  And the workers would just come over  And say you know  Mr. Johnson  Stop it  Stop it  And I was talking to one of the girls  And I said what's his story  She goes oh  He was a gym teacher  For many years  And you know  He just slowly degraded  And now he's sitting here  Probably having flashbacks  That there's not enough soccer balls  For his students  Or something  And just 
[02:18:30]  Yells help  All the time  And he looks all troubled  It's just old people  Have that sad look  Like oh it's over Johnny  Just waiting  Just waiting  It's like  It's like the Grim Reaper  Has an office  Like a doctor's office  And they're all in the waiting room  They're all in the waiting room  Ready to get the call  The name  Mrs. Smith  The Grim Reaper  We'll see you now  Here comes the light  And you just  No  Stop walking  You're in the waiting room

[02:21:00]  Yeah  It's like an event  It's so  It's so depressing man  And I know  The place my mom  Was at for a little while  I mean they do  A great job  I mean I'm not  I'm not trashing  What these people do  Because it's got to be  One of the toughest jobs  To do  And they try to keep  It interesting  For the people  Living there  They have like  You know parlor day  Where they get their  Oh the games  And their hair  Oh their hair done  Yeah so a local  Both of them  A local salon comes by  And does the hair  You know with students  Once or twice a week 
[02:21:30]  And they're  It's  I swear to god  It's so depressing  Because they look forward  To this  And they're all lined up  In their wheelchair  To get their hair done  I don't know  I've always looked  At institutional living  Like kind of a cool thing  You know  You got your little room  You don't have to leave it  If you don't want  There's TV  And then occasionally  You can pop out  Do stuff  And then you're back  In your room  I kind of like that  You live like that now  You're absolutely right  You know you  You're Anthony  I don't want the outside in  Help

[02:23:00]  And I'm there  I'm banging her  So I go up  Every day  For a few days  And I started looking around  Going  This wouldn't be that bad  I'd have the run of the place  It would be like Cuckoo's Nest  You know  You'd be king of the retards  Like I really started thinking  I should check in here  Because you get all the sex you want  You just gotta you know  Give the girl a little bit of a boost  In her self esteem  And you're in  You could rob people blind  Just by tricking them 
[02:23:30]  With stupid parlor tricks  And games  Out of their money  Or food  That their family brings them  I kind of  Started looking at  Institutional living  As an option  Your buddy's on the line  This is when the hermit  Started in your life  The late teens  Yeah  I'm gonna build a shelter  Cowbell Bill  How be  It's been a while buddy  What's up brother  How you been man  Good man  Excellent  It's busy  So I haven't gotten in there  Yeah you gotta stop by

[02:26:00]  Chris in Michigan  What's up Chris  Hey boys  I just want to say  I love the show  But yeah  I used to work  For a home health care company  And all we did was  We delivered oxygen  Hospital beds  Set up supplies  For these patients  In the nursing homes  And the first time  That I had to go through there  I walked in  And the stench of death  It was terrible  Yeah it's like that  Old people  Urine  Lysol  Yeah disinfectant

[02:27:00]  Right  I mean normally  That's a terrible tragedy  But like Anthony said  These people live their lives  And they're rotting  In the hallways  Maybe that should be  A mandatory thing  For a senior citizen  You take them out  On the boat ride  That never comes back?

[02:29:00]  And now I'm surrounded  It's noon  Great Neck  On a Sunday  Oh boy  So it's all just  Old people  Couples  Old people  With their families  Sitting down  I did  And I'm listening to  Conversations  Because they talk loud  Because they all can't hear  Every single conversation  Nothing but death  Yep  Disease  And doctors  It was the worst  I'm trying to eat  And they are just going off 
[02:29:30]  About tumors  And their bones cracking  And this doctor is great  And that one  And then they're showing each other  One old guy is like  And then this on my neck  I got this  On my neck  And no  He's a good doctor  He takes the  The HMO  And the  It is just  So I'm listening to one table  And it's disgusting me  So I'm talking to my  Girlfriend  And then to my right  I start hearing another one 
[02:30:00]  Perking up  Oh yes  She passed  But she was in the hospital  For about three months  It was the cancer  And there was nothing  They could do about it  The poor  We visited her  And she was just  Rotting away in her bed  Skin and bones  Just skin and bones  Her way to live  Is this a joke  It got to the point  Where I said  There was mirrors on the wall  I said there has to be  A camera back there  And this is a joke on me  Because every single conversation  I turn  Another couple comes in  And they're talking  With the guy  That runs the diner 
[02:30:30]  Who is standing up  Next to their table  Talking about  Some nerve disease  That makes them shake  And that she's got to go  To his doctor  Because he cured it  And the old man  Is talking about his feet  This is a place  Where people eat  But old people  Just adore  Talking about disease  And death  When they get out  Disease, death, misery  Yeah  And deterioration  Because they don't feel  So lonely and lonely  Because everyone's sick 
[02:31:00]  We're all done  You call my house  You call my mother's house  After 10 o'clock  You know she answers the phone  Who's dead?  Who's dead?  That's how she answers the phone  Hello  Who died?  They just  Can you come up  With something else  Especially in a public  I don't care  If you're sitting  At your house  Talk with your husband  Or your friggin' children  About your god awful  Fucking disgusting  Old diseases  It starts at 60  Does it?  Because I've seen some people  It starts at 60  Yeah, 60  It really does  Remember the conversation  We just had in the bathroom 
[02:31:30]  Oh yeah  Yeah, what are you guys  Talking about?  I was sharing dump stories  With Adam  Yeah, he's like  Adam, you're right  Adam's like  Because, you know  I've been to doctors  And stuff, you know  And I'm just not regular still  That's fine in the bathroom  With Adam  That's true  Not sitting at a diner  Talking about psoriasis  But then we're bragging  Like, he's like  He's regular  He does, what, two, right?  Yeah  I used to do three in the morning  Yeah  Like clockwork  Like clockwork, right?  It was like clockwork  But with this stupid  Morning radio stuff 
[02:32:00]  I don't know  I don't know which way  He's up sometimes  So we're just explaining  This in the bathroom  That's a mess  And then Danny  Who's a lot younger than me  He's having the same problem  And he used to be regular  So it has something to do  With this morning radio crap  Okay  Getting up early  I've been poked  And probed  But the point of the story  Is we used to go into the bathroom  With cocaine  Talking about girls  Now we're like  Are you regular?  Yeah  So it's happening to us already  Is the point Adam's trying to make  I guess, Anthony  And then I told Adam  And then when the body  Finally decides 
[02:32:30]  Alright, you've had enough torture  And allows you to release  I am going to start taking pictures  Because I'm absolutely  No  Well, I'll throw it on the website  If you want to look  You can look  If you don't  You don't have to look  Because Danny agrees with me too  Put it behind some kind of adult check  Danny agrees with me  And he's like  Yeah, I'm the same way  All of a sudden  You look back at the ball  And you're amazed  You're like  All that was just in me?  Are you kidding me?  I was like  Am I a bear?  Right  It is something that you do want to document  You want to document  I actually take pride in it sometimes 
[02:33:00]  I'm like Tom Hanks in Castaway  I have made fire  Look at what I've accomplished  I had one of the most embarrassing experiences  Of my life once  This happened about a year or so ago  Maybe a little longer  Duty on the head?  No  I took  I took one  That I swear  The size of it  Was ridiculous  Like I looked  And just went  That did not just come out of me  And it was this bright 
[02:33:30]  Almost yellow color  It was fluoresce  It was just screaming for attention  It was huge  And I can't emphasize  How big  So I shut the top of the bowl  Flush  And walk out  Yeah  My girlfriend's mother  Walks in  After me  She shuts the door  A couple of seconds later  The door opens  She goes  Well there's  There's something in there 
[02:34:00]  Like she didn't want to say anything  Or something  I'm like  Okay  And then I go  Uh oh  So she leaves the bathroom  I walk in  Lift it  This thing didn't go anywhere  This didn't budge  It was sitting  Through a full flush  Exactly as I left it  Just  That's a fine  Flip the bowl open  That's a fine  How do you do  It was so embarrassing  And I didn't have a plunger  So I got like a rolled up  Daily news  And I'm just trying to  Bust it apart  It was 
[02:34:30]  So completely embarrassing  Mine at times  Gets so packed  So when I finally release  It looks like an old  Barbershop pole  What?  I hope not red  And white striped  No but you can see  Individual meals  Basically  Really?  Oh no  I'm the only one  No I love that  When you could  Just by taking a look  At your log  You could figure out  When your body  Stopped processing  One meal  I started working  Gave up on that one 
[02:35:00]  Oh that's funny  Oh I'm like  You're shitting a timeline  Oh without a doubt dude  I'm like  Wow  So it takes two days  To release a burrito  After you eat it  Nothing scares the shit  Out of you  Like an undigested  Piece of red pepper  Though  You look  I'm bleeding  Oh I'm not  A chunk of flesh  Oh that's right  I had the red pepper  And some salad  Some little green bits  Go out in there  And it's a great way  Spinach too scares me  Yeah  It's like green and stuff  Of course it is  It's a great way  To keep track of your diet 
[02:35:30]  And you go  Oh I was obviously  Eating bad  Right in there  This is such a horrid  Conversation  I was drunk once  There are beautiful girls  Out there listening to this  I was drunk in college  I woke up  And I went  I lifted  I got up  I turned around  I looked down  And I went  Oh when did I eat a nickel  Now I swear you  At home  Anytime now  Anytime  I flush  Wash my hands  And then take another look  And then get back  And then take another look  And sometimes  I'll even flush again 
[02:36:00]  And I usually do  Even though it's  Empty flush again  Because sometimes  A little milk dud  Hides  Like a moray eel  In a cave  It hides  Where the water goes out  And it'll be sitting there  Until some reason  I don't know  The midday sun  Heats the water up  It changes the fluid dynamics  And here he comes forward  Hi I'm back  And it goes bloop  Just a float around in there  And that's something  You don't want a loved one  Seeing ever 
[02:36:30]  You just don't want  The big one  Was so big and ridiculous  That it just overpowered everything  But the little ones there  That's just  Alright listen  Listen  I'm gonna go out on a limb here  Go ahead  But what the hell  I say we have a dump contest  Between the boys  No  Who's in?  I am in  No  I'm in  I'm so out  I'm too regular to win  And I just  That ain't me  Come on Ant  No way  You can come back  Just to bring in your dump picture  Jimmy would be involved

[02:38:30]  And just have it look like  You dumped a pot of stew  In there  No this is wrong  This is so wrong man  I think the listeners  Would enjoy this  I'm so glad I got a camera phone  Who else is in  Danny you're in  Eric you're definitely in  Anthony and maybe  I'm in  Any of the boys  Travis raising his hand  Nathaniel  I'm going on the road  If anything happens on the road  That I think is noteworthy  I'll email you a picture  I'm only turning it in  If I feel it's a winner  I am not going for second place here 
[02:39:00]  That's just embarrassing  But if I do something  That is like  Oh that wins  Yeah  Then I'll submit  Something that looks like  Barbra Streisand  Something that comes out  Just huge  Is Steve in  Steve's gotta be in  Ben in  Hey does a bear shit  Oh  Well that's part of the contest  Do we want to involve  Like people like  Stalker Patty  And the big A  Big A  Contest over  You in Steve  Steve would you be involved  In something like this  Ow  Jesus  Motherfucking chair 
[02:39:30]  He almost fell on his ass  You are having a bad day  He's in the sitting position  Chasing the chair  With his ass  Across the studio  Because it was rolling backwards  Instead of just standing up  He's trying to sit  Because I was going to fall down  I was just  Which would have been hysterical  I know  And I'm not giving you fuckers  That satisfaction today  Steve you in?  Well what's the criteria  Does that have to be like  Big and huge  Because I don't really have  Huge dumps anymore  No there's no criteria  Oh he's got the stapled stomach  I got stapled guts  So I don't really have them anymore 
[02:40:00]  We should set a criteria  No it's basically a week  To see what you can do  And you bring in the results  Yeah I'll try  But it's not really  You know I just  I don't do the big ones anymore  I haven't for years  Because like  Yeah  And you can't cheat  You can't like  You know  Keep dumping over your  No  It's got to be one dump  It's like American Idol though  Because some people  Are good singers  Right  Some look the part more  But aren't as good singers  So it's all going to be judged  On the big picture  The big picture  And we got to make a pact  It's one dump 
[02:40:30]  It's one dump  And no faking it  You know what you should do  Don't show up a bunch of Snickers  And mold it together  And throw it in there  Everybody should have the same diet  Because now it's like NASCAR  No one's going to eat like me  No this  You got to eat your own fuel  Yeah  Yeah  And don't open up a can of like  I don't know  Creamed corn and dump it in  Dump it in as a garnish  Yeah don't do any of that  It's all got to go through you  In one serving  One dump  That's right  So Steve you're in?  Yeah  Sure  What about Ben?

[03:04:00]  I mean the jealousy  How do you guys get around that?  We're not jealous  He sleeps with other girls  I sleep with other guys  We're freaks  But somewhere in your head  This is a jealousy thing  There has to be  We're all human  You just  You see him railing another girl  Or he comes back to the house  And tells you about it  That doesn't bother you at all?  Uh-uh  Man  You watch his movies?  Huh?  No I won't watch his movies  You won't watch him banging other  I won't watch him  Unless I'm banging another chick with him  There  Yeah  Whatever  Like in your relationship  What's cheating? 
[03:04:30]  If you sleep with another chick  Not on film  So as long as there's a camera rolling  Yeah  That rocks  Guys there you go  There you go  Just make sure a camera's rolling  As long as there's a camera rolling  No honey  I'm trying to sell this to  Now that's odd  That you won't watch  One of his movies  With him screwing a girl  That you're not in  But there's no jealousy there  There has to be something there  If you won't watch  No  It's business  You just gotta know  What's business  And what's  You know

[03:05:30]  That cause it comes so easily  That it's just always gonna come  And you gotta realize  You're not gonna be long  In this business  Because your looks go away  And your business  Is based on your looks  And if you're not smart  With your money  You keep blowing it on things  You don't invest  And then yeah  You're gonna get screwed  Yeah  You're screwing yourself  But  But I just mean  The lifestyle itself  Usually  You know  Tax a little weathering  On the women  In porn  And the shelf life  Is short  Yeah  Yeah  Yeah  That's a  Because I'm just saying  Because you know

[03:20:00]  He was like oh no  Here it comes  And then he even like  Teased it  He did a little ass dance  Almost like he knew  We were screaming  He was like don't worry  Here it comes  And then nothing  So what's up Al  I don't fucking know man  What are you asking me for  It's like 8 in the morning here  Some shit  Well you  Where are you again  I forgot  I'm in  I'm in  Hell Paso Texas  Oh that's right  That's right  A couple hours early  Fucking desert man  Trying to finish this record  But I keep having to  Yap with you knuckleheads  Well here's the deal  Al Jorgensen came in  From ministry  And quite frankly 
[03:20:30]  We're like okay  That could be alright  But it turned out to be  It turned out to be great radio  We had a great time  You told some great radio stories  And stuff  And then as you're leaving  You're like telling  Even better stories  About a toilet in Japan  And other things  So we told you  You had to call back  And tell one of these stories  I think it was  The Japanese toilet one  The Japanese toilet one's alright  But you guys really  Should get into  The fucking wearing diapers  In Australia one  What  Alright 
[03:21:00]  Let her rip  Ask a question  Yeah  How do you set that up  But  Alright  Well  Alright  So we go to Australia  We're playing this big day out  Which is like  Their Lollapalooza  And first night  Actually it wasn't even Australia  We flew to New Zealand  To Auckland  Yeah  So we land  We get off  And  Go to the hotel  And there's a crowd  Full of people  Already there  So like  You know  It's like they knew  We were coming  It was weird  It was like 
[03:21:30]  The fucking Beatles  Or something  It was cool  So anyways  This chick  Takes me away  Okay  And we go to her house  And we start drinking  Jägermeister  Which was like  I had no idea that  South of the equator  They put codeine  In their Jägermeister  Codeine  They do  They put fucking codeine  In there  I was freaked out  So I drank a bottle of that  Next thing you know  I'm stagging around  Like I just got hit in the head  With a sledgehammer  So I'm stagging around  Her house  And she says 
[03:22:00]  Her boyfriend's coming back soon  Let's fuck now  Okay  So I'm like  Alright  Except that  You know  Too drunk to fuck  In the immortal words  Of the dead Kennedys  So  I go staggering out  Into her fucking living room  Thinking I'm  I'm in the bathroom  I'm that high at this point  And so I start peeing  In her fireplace  For some reason  I thought I was in the toilet  So I'm looking for the flusher  And as I'm looking for the flusher  See I have like plumbing issues  I guess  Or something  Because like I told you  The Japanese toilet story too 
[03:22:30]  But anyway  I'm looking for the flusher  I fall over  Into the fireplace  Piss all over myself  And pass out  Alright  So that was a great start  To the fucking day  And her boyfriend's coming too  Which is awesome  So I'm lying there  In the fireplace  And I'm passed out  Until the next morning  Right  I mean it's just like  You slept in her fireplace  I slept in her fireplace  Covered in my own piss  With your dick  Probably still hanging out  That was a great start  To our fucking Australian tour 
[03:23:00]  So the next morning  Her fucking boyfriend  Is offering me breakfast  That's what I woke up to  Is him shoving a plate  Of fucking sausage  Beans and eggs  Or some British shit  In my face  Like hey man  Are you okay  Do you want some breakfast  I'm like  No I need to  Fucking get out of here  So I'm trying to  Get back to the hotel  Except I forgot  What hotel I was  Staying at  So finally  I get a cab driver  I remember where I'm staying 
[03:23:30]  Cab driver comes  He won't take me  In the cab  Because I smell too much  Like fucking urine  So I gotta wait  For another cab  So another cab comes  Takes me back  To the hotel  I walk to the lobby  There's my road crew  Getting ready for the day  Right  In the lobby  They see me  Covered in piss  Reeking like shit  And it turns out  They just talked to  A Depends  A Depends diapers  Spokesman  Or a salesman  Or some shit  And so they're like 
[03:24:00]  Dude you  You really need  Some of these  Fucking diapers  Man you stink  Like fucking piss  What do they think  You just pissed yourself  Walking or  Yeah just  Just out for a morning  Stroll peeing myself  You know  At any rate  They get the  Fucking Depends  Guy to like  Give us a box  Of fucking Depends  So  I put on the Depends  Alright  And they're like  Some kind of  Fucking Samoan size  Or something  They're like  Size 55  Or some shit like that  So the first time  I peed in the Depends 
[03:24:30]  It ran down my legs  Why were you wearing them  Just to pee in them  Well because my road crew  Said I needed them  And I always listen  To my road crew  And you figure  If you're wearing them  It'll save you a trip  To the bathroom  Save you a little time  Dude you have no idea  The demographic  That Depends  Is missing on  It's like all the  Keith Richards of the world  Why wait in a  Fucking bathroom line  At a club  When you can just  Piss yourself  It does sound like  It makes sense  Okay  It's fucking liberating 
[03:25:00]  Too  There's nothing better  Than somebody  That's boring  The shit out of you  While you're talking to them  You just stop  In the middle  Of the conversation  And go  You know what I'm  Doing right now  I'm pissing myself  It's so fucking liberating  I'll tell you what though  It was kind of hard  To shit yourself though  Because you kind of  Got a strain  And grunt  And shit like that  And people know  What you're doing  Especially if you're  Wearing diapers  And it gets a bit weird  But pissing yourself  Is really easy  Yeah  It's like  So anyways 
[03:25:30]  Where was I  What the fuck  It's too old  Who the hell knows  Whoever knows  With you Al  You were talking about  How it's tough to dump  In the Depends  Because you have to strain  Well yeah  That's  It's almost impossible  Man  Unless like  You're doing like  Mr. Universe poses  You know  You gotta fucking like  Really strain  To get that turd out  Of course  You know  Peeing yourself  Is liberating  Yeah  Alright  So anyways 
[03:26:00]  So they take me down  And I just  Peeed myself  In Ward of Pens  For three weeks  In Australia  Basically  My entire wardrobe  Was combat boots  And Depends  And a drink  With a straw  Umbrella  In there  You know  That was  Walking around the beach  Very romantic  Very nice  So  Were you just wearing  The Depends  Or did you have  Something over them  No  Just the Depends  Because I love to hear  That crinkle  When you pee  You never disappoint Al  Alright

[03:27:00]  You think  Yeah  Waking up in a fireplace  Well I like the waking up  In the fireplace  Depends  I don't know  It definitely didn't top  The rocket  In the tour bus story  Right  And I kind of like  The Japanese toilet story  Better than that one  The Japanese toilet story  Yeah  I'm just giving  His Depends story  I'll write it down here  A C  C's not bad  I'm giving it  It passes  But it's nowhere near the A  That was the rocket story  Alright  Well we're going to play  This Dr. Ruth clip  For the girls  Before one of them

[03:28:30]  In order to be happy  Can't you just be  Kind of like  Friends  First of all  Don't say Woofie  Say sex  Second  The answer is  You don't have to do it  Anymore every day  You can skip a day  But there is no question  Every other day  In order to have a good  If everybody's healthy  In order to have a good  Why it's always the women  That have to bring that up  Like did  Did you hear her?  Yeah if you're  Married for a long time  Do you really have  To still have sex  Every day 
[03:29:00]  Do you have to have sex  Not even every day  She was saying  Right  She was like  Do you really just have  To be having sex  I mean it's always  The women that say that  You don't just shake hands  Do you really have to  When do we  Sure  When do we get to stop  The other day  In order to have a good  If everybody's healthy  In order to have a good relationship  In order for people to smile  In order for people to walk down the street  With a straightforward date 
[03:29:30]  You ought to have sex  Alright every couple of days  At least it sounds like  How do you keep the  How do you keep the fire of passion burning  What's your best tip for  How does she know?  For keeping it together in a marriage  My best tip is to  Kick boredom out of the bedroom  If you do it in the same position  In the same way  It becomes boring  Boring  So you have to use some fantasy  And the other point is that  The woman has to talk to a gynecologist 
[03:30:00]  To make sure  That there is no pain  It's very important  Chris and Jody  That most women  After we go through menopause  Unfortunately  Do develop some dryness problems  In our vagina  Dry, dry, dry vagina  Oh god  The menopause  The dry vagina 
[03:30:30]  Give me a vomiting porn star every time  I'll take a wet vomiting porn star  Here we go  Dry, dry, dry vagina  Dry, dry, dry vagina  So before my penis starts to get sore 
[03:31:00]  Go pick up some Dazzy Lube at your local drugstore  Said go get some Dazzy Lube at your local drugstore  Oh, you stink, baby  There you have it, Brother Joe  That's what you need  You got a sample Dr. Ruse saying dry vagina in there  Yeah, no shit  Dry vagina 
[03:31:30]  Dry, dry, dry  Brother Joe and  To you  To you, thank you  We're playing our Halloween bash  Halloween night at the Hard Rock Cafe  That's right  Absolutely huge  Yes, Ben  They're actually playing the BB Kings tonight  They're going to go to the U2 show  At Madison Square Garden  They're doing like an after party  So they go on after like 11.30  Oh, I guess 11.30  11.30, 12ish  Because the U2 show ends around 11, 11.30  Very nice  Give them a plug  Yankee game  What are they saying about the weather? 
[03:32:00]  Earl claims they're going to play  That's Earl's  Oh, alright  Well, then I'm there  Meteorologist Earl  Who's he dressed like today?  D'Artagnan  Earl, I think they'll get it in  I checked my computer models  I want to be a musketeer  Alright, back to Dr. Ruth  Yep  Chris and Jody  That most women  After we go through menopause  Unfortunately  Do develop some dryness problems  In our vaginas  And that does not  Though mean the end of a good sex life 
[03:32:30]  That indeed  That you can use lubricants  Things like that  But for many women  That's not enough  That's the bad news  The good news is  Enough  That you can use a little bit of vaginal estrogen  A little vaginal estrogen tablet  Like Vagifem  Use it a couple of times a week  It's really quite safe  And that will maintain the term  That I love to use  And Dr. Ruth's adopted it  The term of a happy vagina  A little bit of estrogen  Will keep that vagina quite happy  And you can keep that sex going  I always giggle  When I hear a happy vagina 
[03:33:00]  In the morning  I giggle  I giggle when I hear that  At 8.53  All right Dr. Ruth and Dr. Mary Jane  Thank you both very much  You have a happy vagina  And the guy's got a disappointed cock  If it's a happy vagina  Why is it frowning like the scream mask?  That is the last thing  From a happy vagina  That's the last thing that looks happy  Oh yeah  I don't care how many estrogen  Vag tablets you're taking 
[03:33:30]  Yeah it looks like Grandpa's smiling great  With his teeth out  With his teeth  Yes  After the menopause  Oh it's over Johnny  Stop it  And you know what the dryness  Brings on right?  What?  The bad smell  Oh boy  Oh yeah?  Well the lube kind of takes away  It's a beach right?  It covers it up  You don't smell anything  When it's high tide  But when that water goes out  And leaves behind  There you go  If you're seeing a seaweed line  Some crabs 
[03:34:00]  An old shopping cart  Yeah you know  Could be a problem with the smell  You're right  A dead witness  The beach always smells good at high tide  There's no problems at high tide  Once the water leaves  And recedes  And recedes  And all that's left  Is those  Sucks out the moisture  Those little things you can pop  And the green seaweed  If your vagina is controlled  By the gravitational pull of the moon  Yeah  It's not going to smell very good  At low tide  Something to be said  Any more Ruth?
