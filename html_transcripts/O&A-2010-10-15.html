<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast began with the hosts complaining about technical difficulties and their own shortcomings, quickly transitioning to Opie's severe diarrhea the previous night, which caused him to miss a retirement party.  This led to a discussion of Jim Norton's similar ailment, blamed on a combination of food, performance anxiety, and a rough drive back from a Foxwoods gig with Club Soda Kenny.  A caller, Gennaro, a federal police officer from Plum Island, recounted Jesse Ventura's failed attempts to access the island for his conspiracy show, portraying Ventura as cowardly and dishonest.  This segued into a discussion of a new Ventura conspiracy theory about a homosexual agenda hidden in the media coverage of the Chilean miner rescue. The hosts then launched into homophobic and racially charged jokes about the miners and the movie "For Colored Girls," debating the appropriateness of the word "colored."  Tangents included discussions of the Ron & Fez show, Opie's childhood racism, and a listener comparing Opie & Anthony to Hamish & Andy.  The hosts extensively brainstormed a movie based on Opie's childhood, envisioning various celebrities in roles, even extending this to an animated version.  More offensive jokes about race and sexuality followed.  Big A from the Ron & Fez show was considered as a potential guest.  The movie idea continued to dominate the conversation, focusing on a movie based on Anthony Cumia's life ("Anthony Cumia: An American Dream"), with comedic casting suggestions (Zac Efron with zit makeup, Chyna as Buzz, Craig Robinson, the kid from *Kick-Ass*),  and director choices (Judd Apatow and David Fincher).  The divorce was considered a sequel.  The discussion then shifted to a planned Halloween party, an argument over invitations, a bet involving Bobo's penis and donuts, and an intern's car accident and illness, including a video of the hosts scaring him on Break.com.  A significant part focused on a conflict with banned guest Ira, speculated to be caused by a "babysitter" inquiring about his appearances on other shows. A news segment, delivered by Big A and Bobo, was riddled with stumbles and deviations, covering a UFO sighting, the Chilean miner rescue, *Dancing with the Stars*, Joy Behar and Whoopi Goldberg's politics, the Ground Zero mosque controversy, and Bill O'Reilly's commentary.  The show continued with discussions about age appropriateness for activities like ass-eating, congratulations for Big A's son, and more banter with Bobo.  A segment saw Bobo struggling intensely with a simple news intro, prompting expletive-laden outbursts from the hosts, his breathing described as that of a "rape victim." This was followed by further discussion of the Jesse Ventura conspiracy video, and speculation about the Guns N' Roses reunion. Drs. Steve and Mike were in studio. Dr. Steve recounted an awkward dinner party with Opie and his wife, culminating in him saying "I love you" to Opie's wife. Dr. Steve's recent marriage and book were discussed, along with reluctance to share details due to potential legal issues.  The "What the Hell Is That?" segment featured "Puddle of AIDS," revealing a bloody hole near his anus, diagnosed as a pilonidal cyst, with graphic descriptions and visual examination.  His online sports blog and the Yankees' playoff chances were also mentioned.  Vic Henley was present, plugging his shows and joking about his relationship with Jim Norton.  The "What the Hell Is That?" segment continued, beginning with discussions of bizarre ingrown hair removal methods. "Hate Speech Radio" (Dave) described his epidermolysis bullosa, a rare skin disorder. Doctors examined and even induced blisters, discussing the rarity and non-contagious nature of the disease and the possibility of a bone marrow transplant.  Big A described profuse sweating and difficulty speaking, diagnosed as Obesity Hypoventilation Syndrome.  A photo of a bloody wound on Big A's buttocks ("puddle of AIDS squirting blood") was shown, along with a large underarm skin tag (acro-cordon). E-Rock smelled both the skin tag and Big Aâ€™s wound.  Bobo briefly introduced his own medical mystery to conclude the show.  Throughout, the broadcast contained substantial vulgar language, discussions of bodily functions, and explicit descriptions of medical conditions and procedures.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  Our show is stupid.  This is so irresponsible.  This should be illegal.  It really should be.  It's like, it's so unethical.  God, I hate fucking radio.  This could be the worst audio ever.  Shut up. 
[00:00:30]  Shut your fucking mouth.  This is terrible.  We just suck all around.  I hope you show restraint in fucking my girlfriend.  This stinks.  Fucking shut the fuck up.  We get it.  We get it.  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road.  Oh, there we go.  Nice.  We almost didn't start on time today. 
[00:01:00]  I wasn't plugged in.  You were plugging out.  Oh, well, that was dueling toilets, my friend.  You were in there, too.  What the hell?  I heard you.  We ran back in the studio just in time.  We're getting ready for the show, and it's like, oh, boy, I don't feel too good right  now.  I got to go to the bathroom.  And then that got me going.  So then I ran after you.  It's like when someone puked in school.  Everyone would just start puking.  We just had a shit off in the bathroom.  And then I'm in a stall, and I hear in my head, tick-tock, tick-tock. 
[00:01:30]  We made it, though.  Yeah.  I don't know what happened last night.  Oh, my God.  What happened?  Oh, my God.  What do you mean by what happened?  The rain?  No.  Well, yeah, there was some rain from my ass into my toilet.  Oh, oh.  It was terrible.  I just had my normal turkey sandwich here and my V8s, right?  And then I go home, and I had a little ham and Swiss on a roll. 
[00:02:00]  Swiss.  On a roll with some mustard.  Nice.  It was wonderful.  And so I crap out for a little while to take a nap.  And I woke up with just, with a damn near felt Hades in my belly.  It was gurgling and, like, squeaky door.  Rusty hinge, percolating coffee.  The back of my thighs were hurting. 
[00:02:30]  I was fucking sweating.  What the hell?  I went into the bathroom, and it was just like, oh, no.  Oh, God.  Oh, Jesus.  I thought all of my innards were coming out.  Ugh.  And that didn't stop.  Like, it was a few times.  And, wow.  Bad.  And I actually, it was, like, at about 7.30, I went to bed.  For the night?  I went to bed.  I woke up at, like, midnight or whatever the fuck.  But I just went the fuck to bed. 
[00:03:00]  I'd had it.  I was aching.  And, uh.  Feel better?  Yeah, I missed that party.  I was supposed to go to a party last night, and I fucking missed it.  And who's party?  I was a retirement party for, um, for Kevin down at the pistol licensing division in Mineola.  Out there, Mineola there.  But, uh.  Why is he retiring?  Well, he's retirement age.  Oh, okay.  Yeah, he's leaving.  Well, sometimes, uh, people have, they retire for other things.  Oh, issues?  You know.  Nah, he was done.  To stay one step ahead of the law. 
[00:03:30]  He was, no.  No, he was the law.  You know, he's the law.  That's what county guys.  But, uh.  What's the age out there?  Oh, what's that?  What's the age for retirement out there?  I don't know.  I think he's in his, uh.  He retired a little early.  Yeah.  Yeah, a little earlier.  I think they got these incentives now for retiring.  They're just like, please get the fuck out of here.  Sure.  We'll give you some cash and leave.  But I wanted to go to that.  And then I'm just fucking gurgling.  And then I come in this morning, and everything was cool. 
[00:04:00]  It was making noises.  I was getting a.  And I sat down here, and I'm like, all right.  And then all of a sudden, I'm like, oh, jeez.  I've got to go back in there.  You know what?  Something's going on, because I got a last-minute email from Club Soda Kenny.  Yes.  I was checking Jimmy's Twitters last night.  Jim Norton will not be here today.  No.  Now, he played Foxwoods last night, which is two and a half hours away from here.  These lunatics were going to do the show.  Norton was going to do the show.  And then Club Soda Kenny was going to drive him back to New York so he could do radio, 
[00:04:30]  just so he could then go back to Foxwoods for the rest of the weekend.  Yep.  I'm like, wow, that's crazy.  But we got the email that Jimmy wasn't feeling good on the way back,  so they turned around and went back to Foxwoods in the middle of the night.  They did the show last night.  Yeah.  Jimmy did the show.  He then, he said he was eating some fruit in the dressing room,  and he had some dinner beforehand.  And then he went out, and he said the lights were really hot on stage. 
[00:05:00]  And he felt this little wave of nausea during his show, but it went away real quick.  And then they, like, got done, got off stage, got in the car, ready to fucking leave.  Right.  And they drove, and it's the middle of nowhere out there.  I know.  Kenny's like, there's no light.  There's no signs.  Nothing.  And Jimmy had to grow up.  So we had to pull over, and then I got lost.  How did he get lost just because he pulled over?  I don't know.  There's no signs.  It's pitch black.  Jimmy was cursing God. 
[00:05:30]  Oh, really?  He was cursing God.  And so he was eating some crackers, pretzels, and drinking ginger ale like a little faggot, as he put it.  Yeah.  And he should be fine for tonight.  But I think he thought and everybody thought it would be best if he just laid down and relaxed.  My point, I think something's going around, because I'm kind of, like, percolating a little bit as you talk.  Something happened.  You're percolating, and Jimmy's out.  I didn't do anything different.  I'm trying to figure out what was going on here yesterday, all three of us together. 
[00:06:00]  Now all three's sort of feeling a little strange.  I'm not sick like Jimmy is, but.  Did Dr. Steve bring something in?  He probably did.  You know, he's around sick people all the time.  I brought some kind of bug in here.  A bug.  Damn Dr. Steve.  With a bug.  Maybe something escaped from Plum Island, Gennaro's saying.  Ah, could have happened.  Wait, he actually works at Plum Island?  No.  Gennaro.  Yes, sir.  What's up, sir?  Are you working at Plum Island? 
[00:06:30]  Yes, I do.  Nice.  Yeah, what do you do?  Federal police officer.  Oh, okay.  So you keep people like Jesse Ventura off your fucking island.  Absolutely.  Actually, I was not there that day.  But I'll get to why I wasn't even there in a minute.  I'm glad you put me on because I really, last night I'm watching TV and I see his, I guess,  trailer for this.  And such a badass he is.  I'm going to expose the truth and it's pretty fucking disgusting, this guy. 
[00:07:00]  Well, obviously, just to help people along a little bit, the second season of Conspiracy  with Jesse Ventura.  First show.  First show of the second season, right?  Yeah, yeah.  And it's a joke show.  It really is.  And he wanted to expose what's going on in Plum Island, which is a little island at the  end of Long Island that no one's allowed to go to because they're experimenting on  animals and shit.  What they say, you know, whatever.  I don't know what they do there.  No one knows what they do there.  I just want to pull a tentative shenanigans right now on Gennaro. 
[00:07:30]  Oh, really?  Yeah, it's tentative.  I could be wrong, but I wanted to talk a little more.  Are we heading toward a frunkus?  I don't know what it could be.  Absolutely not.  Come on.  Come on.  All right.  What are your shenanigans?  I'll help you out.  No, I don't know.  I just want to know, like, all right, you called.  You say Jesse's bullshit.  We know that and stuff.  So why weren't you there?  Because it wasn't actually my tour.  It wasn't my tour to do the duty.  I work Fridays and Saturdays out there because I'm one of the... 
[00:08:00]  All right.  So it wasn't your day when Jesse Ventura was...  Let's cut to the chase.  We got lots to do today.  We got the, what the hell is that show that we're prepping for?  He shows up when you get there.  I'm sure, I don't know if you guys have ever been to the Orient Point Ferry.  It's actually right next to the ferry that you take over to Palm Island.  Yeah.  And it's fenced off, the demarcation that clearly, you know, shows that it's U.S. property.  And he was asking through the gate if he could come in ever so kindly because he was saying 
[00:08:30]  he was doing a documentary, but everybody already knew he was coming.  So they immediately shot him down.  And after he was very, very, very polite.  So what he does is he then tries to charter a boat out of Orient Point somewhere to get  over to the island.  Yeah.  Nobody on Orient Point wanted to even help him because the whole North Fork he's been there,  there's a lot of people that work out on that island that live out there.  So I'm going to help this guy out.  Yeah.  They had a list of all the companies, charter boats that wouldn't take him to Plum Island. 
[00:09:00]  Of course they wouldn't.  But it's like, of course they're not going to.  Why would they want to violate a lot?  Right.  They don't want to be in trouble with the feds.  Yeah.  They'll be immediately blackballed from their recommended tourist guide list out there.  Right.  So Jesse trying to get to Plum Island.  We get it.  So he actually ended up going out to Montauk and got a boat out there.  And he was told immediately that if he stepped foot on the island that he would be arrested.  But I'm a former governor, a fighter, a Navy SEAL. 
[00:09:30]  Nobody really gave a shit.  No one ever does.  I actually called that morning because I'd known about it.  Because I worked primarily out of Central Island.  Genaro.  Genaro, seriously.  It's way too early for this.  I got to jump in.  He's lonely out on that island, Opie.  You got to stay focused.  Then we got to move.  We got to move.  Is there an end to this story?  Yeah.  We get it.  Like, Jesse had a tough time even getting someone to get him close to Plum Island.  That's on the documentary. 
[00:10:00]  Yeah.  We know all that.  So he got a boat out of Montauk.  Then what happened?  And then he was too scared to come anywhere close to the island.  He's a lying piece of shit.  And he's a pussy.  Really.  Okay.  So, yeah.  The point being, you guys obviously would have arrested him if he stepped foot on Plum Island.  Because you don't want to deal with Jesse or anybody else for that matter.  But the fact also is that Jesse didn't even push it, really.  He just kind of hung out in the water far enough away where no one was going to mess with him.  Right.  Yeah, exactly.  That was the whole point of the story, that he's a vagina. 
[00:10:30]  Okay.  Yeah, because if Jesse really gave a shit about his conspiracies and getting shit done, he  would have pushed the boat driver or whatever to get him as close to Plum Island as possible  to have some kind of interaction with the feds.  Yeah, but nothing.  The Coast Guard is shadowing us.  The Coast Guard.  He had like a thousand-time telephoto lens on a little dinghy from the Coast Guard.  As far as the whole testing and stuff that goes on out there, I don't know because I  don't get out of the car. 
[00:11:00]  Could you get out of the car one day, walk in, and just snort anthrax like it's Coke?  Thank you, Gennaro.  All right, Gennaro.  Thank you.  What was that?  Thank you.  I'm going to frunkus you.  Nothing.  Shut up.  You heard me.  He's a fed.  Be nice to him.  These guys can get things done.  Thanks, Gennaro.  Yeah, but you saw that episode.  And so Jesse's in the water, far away from Plum Island, and far away from the Coast Guard,  I would assume.  No one was hassling him.  Because he wasn't a threat at all to anybody. 
[00:11:30]  I bet you just weekend boaters are more of a threat than Jesse was.  And the narrator was going, coming up, Jesse Ventura, the governor goes Navy SEAL on Plum  Island, and they just show him on the boat, like, because he's on the water, he's going  Navy SEAL.  Right.  And it was nothing.  It was him on a boat going, yeah, well, we have to turn around.  If he was going Navy SEAL, wouldn't there be footage of him coming out of the water near 
[00:12:00]  the shore with a knife in his mouth?  Yeah, knife in his mouth, fucking snorkel.  With a snorkel.  His frog suit on.  Frog.  I brought my Vietnam frogman suit, and I'm going Navy SEAL on Plum Island.  That's Navy SEAL.  You got the dark fucking, uh, whatever.  Yeah, yeah.  I don't want to call it makeup, but the face paint on and shit.  You got the knife in your teeth.  Yeah, yeah.  You come up slow from the water.  You got some kind of Bond girl next to you.  She's got her frog suit on. 
[00:12:30]  I realized then that they had taken me to Nantucket, so I relaxed for a while.  Ugh.  He is a douche.  Well, I took that phone call because I wanted to lead to the brand new bit.  Of course.  Because, you know, we're learning stuff from Jocktober, and Sam taught us yesterday that  if you're doing radio, you got to bring up stuff, not that you care about that subject  at hand, but you bring up stuff to get to a bit.  To get to a bit.  To get to a prep burger bit.  A prep burger.  But let me tell you, uh, let me tell everyone out there, this is not a prep burger bit.  I actually stayed, uh, 10 minutes late yesterday. 
[00:13:00]  Yeah.  To voice something.  Oh my God.  So, Jesse Ventura is working on another conspiracy theory.  Yeah.  And, uh, here it is.  He sees the lies.  The gay elite, they're pushing their agenda on you, and you don't even know it.  The secrets.  Pro-homo propaganda is being rammed down your throat.  The cover-ups.  They're using the media against us.  On the next conspiracy theory, Jesse Ventura exposes it all. 
[00:13:30]  What's really going on with that Chilean mine?  Heart-warming story of survival, or a two-and-a-half-month man-on-man love-a-thon constructed entirely  by queer-controlled global media.  It didn't have to be an expert watching that video to realize how hot those Chilean miners  were.  All of them absolutely covered in sweat.  How aggressive they would like to drill.  How much they would like to drill.  In some ways, those miners were having moments where they were enjoying each other's company. 
[00:14:00]  They had to curve the shaft so it would pass through this, this new, what they call virgin rock.  Yeah, the gay elite want you prancing around like a bunch of sissies and sucking each other's cocks.  If you can't measure, you can't manage it.  Remarkable pictures there, uh, on his knees.  You know, what goes in comes out.  That square hole, and it is dark, and it is ominous.  Uh, it is almost a path to hell, and these men are coming up from that path. 
[00:14:30]  You won't believe what you don't know.  There you go.  I like that.  Mind control.  I like that.  So it's all a big conspiracy.  Is it mind control or mind?  Mind control.  Ah.  Mind control.  Ah, you won't believe what you don't know.  It's Ira.  Is he coming in today?  I hope so.  Can we get him before Jay Thomas gets him?  I need my fix of Ira because, uh. 
[00:15:00]  Look, everyone, everyone around here takes our guys.  Can we start taking other people's guys?  Yeah, we should be able to.  I mean, uh, Big A from the Ron and Fez show will be in here today, I hear.  Didn't you start on our show?  What happened?  It's a very, um, incestuous industry.  It sure is.  I do believe.  Just between us and Ron and Fez.  Don't include everybody else.  Fuck everybody else.  It's us and Ron and Fez.  That's where it stops.  Well, and Jay Thomas, apparently, with one guy.  And a little Jay Thomas.  A little bit.  He's been on the show. 
[00:15:30]  He was actually an influence when I was growing up, so I can't really trash Jay Thomas too much.  Yeah.  Too much.  Hey, what's going on with the minors?  Are we done with this shit?  It's so over.  Yeah, they're really trying to...  It's done.  They're trying to keep the excitement going, but who gives a shit now?  They go back to their shitty lives.  They're trying to keep the excitement going, but these guys just don't have interesting lives.  No charisma.  So they keep doing the Elvis thing, they keep doing the old guy thing, they keep doing the mistress-slash-wife thing.  Yeah, that's the only...  That's like the most interesting story, but it's not even interesting. 
[00:16:00]  Like, the wife finally came out and said she's not going to say hi to him or greet him or say anything.  Like, she could give a shit about him.  That's great.  But it's...  I'm sure, yeah, I'm sure there's going to be a movie and TV shows.  They're going to do TV appearances and...  Oh, this is a documentary coming out.  I think it was Discovery had cameras on the ground or something I was reading as I was doing my thing in the back room.  Yeah, I think they actually have footage of the guys down there.  It's going to be in 3D, like everything else? 
[00:16:30]  Probably.  I'm tired of the 3D.  Don't be tired of the 3D.  It's going to figure itself out finally.  I hope so.  You're thinking old school 3D.  3D is finally here.  In a way we could all appreciate.  My eyes are going crazy.  It's not Jaws 3D, my friend.  We're way past that now.  Better than Jaws 3D where the shark came through the glass?  This is some real shit going on.  I was like, whoa.  I mean, Travis was asking us if we wanted to do a 3D party. 
[00:17:00]  Aren't we in 3D right now?  Well, that's the point.  We're always in 3D.  Like, people are just naturally in 3D.  Yeah.  Yeah, exactly.  Speaking of Ron and Fez, I think Ronnie was giving Fez some shit one day because Fez says  he gets nauseous at 3D movies and stuff.  And he's like, do you get nauseous at life?  Because that's in 3D.  It's the same fucking thing.  Life is 3D, Fez.  That's all it is.  It's the same thing.  I'm cracking up.  Oh, poor Fezzy. 
[00:17:30]  I know.  Exhausting.  Let me say hi to Carl in California.  Carl.  Hi, guys.  How are you guys?  Love the show.  I just want to thank you.  You guys have really fucked regular radio now.  I downloaded a bunch of podcasts from radio stations around the world.  And all I do now is sit there and pick their shit apart.  Have you guys heard of Hamish and Andy?  Hamish and Andy?  Yeah, they're big down in Australia and down there. 
[00:18:00]  There was an Amish and Andy in America, but that goes back to when the coloreds weren't equal.  It's supposed to be the greatest thing down there.  They're really called Amish and Andy.  They were two colored people here in the States, sir.  Oh, for real?  Yes.  This is modern day.  By the way, on a side note, I am just going to start using the word colored now.  I like that one.  Because it's good enough for Tyler Perry. 
[00:18:30]  Tyler Perry's using colored.  He's got a new movie out for colored girls, is the movie.  That's the title?  Yes.  It's called For Colored Girls.  And it's got Janet Jackson.  It's one of these black chick, all of them talking about how fucking fucked up guys are.  Sure.  And I think they have the scene where they drink some wine and dance.  Sure.  You know, it's for colored girls.  So I don't know why.  It's not the N word. 
[00:19:00]  So I'm just going to start using it.  Look.  Who's in there?  Let me see.  Go down a little bit.  We got Janet Jackson.  Yeah.  We got, who's that?  I don't know.  You got Goldberg.  Whoopi's in there.  Whoopi.  Felicia Rashad from Cosby Show.  Yep, yep, yep.  I don't know who that is.  I don't know who that is.  I don't know who that is.  And then some more colored girls.  Some more colored girls.  So why have you been outraged over the years when I've used the word?  Well, now it's okay.  I was just ahead of my time.  Opie, I stick ahead of my time. 
[00:19:30]  I've been saying colored.  I pay attention to the rules.  And I look at what's happening in society.  What happened to you?  In society, I mean.  You never paid attention to the rules.  I mean, just in society.  Like, if Tyler Perry now, who is the, you know, most harmless black guy in the world since Sinbad.  Sure.  If he can just put out a movie called For Colored Girls, I figured colored is going to be the next thing moving on now from African American. 
[00:20:00]  Wouldn't Reverend Al get involved in this?  I don't know.  He probably won't because it's a black guy doing a movie named For Colored Girls.  For Colored Girls.  But shouldn't Reverend Al be all over that?  Uh, no, because Tyler Perry is insane.  That's what I'm saying.  So it's cool.  That's a bit hypocritical.  But I am now just going to start saying colored people.  Because I think it made a comeback.  There are some words that are retro and come back.  Groovy.  I want to bring groovy back.  I think we've got to bring back Afro-American because... 
[00:20:30]  Afro-American.  It was very short-lived.  Because the women are starting to grow those Afros.  Yeah, they're getting the big Afros back.  And man, some of them get my fucking mojo going.  You're digging that?  A little bit.  You're digging the dandelion Afro?  I like the jungle look.  Angela Davis Afro...  I've seen a few...  Speaking of black people.  Hi, Sam.  Good morning.  I've seen a few walk in the streets of Manhattan.  Yeah.  That jungle look.  I call it the jungle look.  Big Afro.  Are we moving into Imus?  Very dark skin. 
[00:21:00]  Are we moving into Imus territory?  I'm scared.  No.  Because the ladies are starting to grow that Afro out.  Sam, you know.  You keep up on the black culture being one of them.  Well, his culture.  His culture, sure.  Yeah, yeah.  Have you noticed that the women are starting to let it go?  There is more of a movement.  Let it go!  It's impossible not to do that.  And I suck at it.  I walk around my house all the time.  It doesn't matter if you're good or bad.  I'll be the first one to tell you I suck at the iron pressure.  You're getting it.  I think you're getting it down.  So much fun to do.  There is more of a movement towards natural hair, which I definitely support. 
[00:21:30]  Which was called, by the way, in the 70s, the natural.  Yes.  If a black girl, a colored girl, had a big Afro, it was called her natural.  Like, yeah, I gotta get my, you know, I gotta trim my natural.  Or look at my natural.  I think it's good.  The natural.  And I was actually called out one day at Disneyland.  At Disneyland.  I know.  It's gonna get so annoying if it isn't already, but I can't help it.  I was there under blue skies.  Yes.  Yes.  I was going on Mr. Toad's Wild Ride. 
[00:22:00]  Is Ira coming in today?  I hope so.  No, I don't think so.  Just call him and tell him to get in early.  What is he, a fucking star now?  Oh, yeah.  Carl.  It's still there.  I'm sorry, Carl.  Ah, fuck him.  He's gone.  There's some dumb show that he realizes is a hacky show now because of Arch-October.  There, I summarized.  Go ahead, Ant.  I was at Disneyland.  I was getting on a ride, and there was a colored girl running the ride.  And it was back, you know, like in the 70s.  I was a little kid.  I had, but I had a giant Afro. 
[00:22:30]  Right.  And she went, she goes to me, she goes, woo, child, your natural's bigger than mine.  Nice.  And she had a big Afro.  Yeah.  And we all laughed.  And the second the ride went in, my dad smacked me in the face and said, we're cutting  that end shit off your head.  Oh, why?  Can I call your dad an asshole?  No, that was great.  Come on.  He taught me everything I know.  But there's too much pressure on you as a kid.  I got smacked in Mr. Toad's Wild Rides. 
[00:23:00]  Why is he smacking you?  And he said, he actually, I quote my father, we're cutting that nigger shit off your head.  Oh, my God.  Because the black girl said I had a natural racism is taught in the home.  Is it?  Yes, it is.  Well, it was a fucking Harvard of racism in my house.  But why?  It was an academy.  It was an academy.  I got a scholarship.  I get the whole story, except the part where he has to smack you.  Why is he smacking you?  Because he had been telling me to cut and get my hair cut.  But how old were you? 
[00:23:30]  I'm going to take you down.  I'm going to get your hair cut.  I must have been maybe 10.  You were responsible for cutting your own hair at 10?  It didn't matter.  You had a fucked up life.  No, it was because I was visiting and shit.  I should have been, you know, in New York, my mother was responsible for taking me down.  So basically, basically, she was, she, basically, your father was hitting your mother through you.  Exactly.  Okay, now I got it.  Because at 10, you shouldn't be responsible for fucking worrying about your hair.  But I'll tell you what, the next day, we went and got to get your shit cut off my fucking head.  That's what happened there, my friend. 
[00:24:00]  The cashier at Radio Shack told me I would get five girlfriends compared to my one now if I would let her dread my hair.  Five girlfriends?  Yeah, but are they, you know, your girlfriend?  Jess, very cute.  That's true.  Quality, not quantity.  Yeah, you could get five, but it's going to be each one one-fifth of Jess.  As Jess, right.  Who is so, so hot.  I agree.  Oh, God.  Well, I haven't seen her in a while. 
[00:24:30]  You should bring her around.  Well, she has a job.  Yeah.  Yeah.  She's working, too.  We're a dual-income household.  Oh, you mean what?  Huh?  Just bring her in here for a little bit.  Yeah.  She's at work.  All right, well, whatever.  Let's say whatever.  She is.  Is she?  Yes.  How do you know?  You sure she's there?  How do you know right now?  Well, because it was her, well, no, she's not there right now.  Oh, where is she now?  She's at home.  It's the morning.  Oh, we're home alone, right?  Why don't we call her?  Yeah, yeah.  She's about alone.  Why don't you give her a little call?  You ever give her a call in the morning just to check?  We text.  One time me and Kenny called her. 
[00:25:00]  She got really creeped out, though.  Yeah?  I guess Kenny kept asking her what she was wearing.  Yeah, Kenny's a creep, and she doesn't play that way.  No, yeah.  She didn't hear that stuff.  In the background, she didn't hear, who's that?  Who's that, motherfucker?  No, the apartment was empty.  Except for her and the cat.  Who's the cat?  Bruiser Brody.  Bruiser Brody.  That's the cat's name.  It's a cat.  All right.  You believe whatever you want.  Enough with the wrestling shit, Sam.  Jesus.  What? 
[00:25:30]  Isn't that a wrestler?  It is.  It was.  Is he dead?  Yeah.  Of course.  Your cat's going to fucking die at a young age because you named him after a wrestler.  Anthony Ford colored.  What is the name?  What's the movie again?  For Colored Girls.  Okay, because we got Stephanie who has a little info on that movie.  Oh, right?  Hey, I think it was even written in the late 70s called For Colored Girls Who Considered  Suicide When the Rainbow Is Enough.  Wow, that sounds great.  That's a pretty long title.  Wait, what?  Wait, wait, wait.  What?  Wait, wait, wait. 
[00:26:00]  What?  For Colored Girls Who Considered Suicide When the Rainbow Is Enough.  When the Rainbow Is Enough.  Yeah.  I'm trying to understand that.  Whoa, was it double rainbow?  Oh, no way.  Oh.  I do think there might be some context to the way Tyler Perry uses colored.  Why?  I mean...  Four colored girls.  I know, but that's what the ladies' rooms used to say back in my day. 
[00:26:30]  Context and subtext matters.  Right next to four white girls.  Yeah, I know, but it seems like you're more regressing than progressing.  Regressing?  No, it's...  We're taking Tyler Perry's lead.  I don't know if that's what he intended.  He finally realizes it was way better back then.  Maybe.  Maybe that's what he's doing.  He's bringing it back.  Keeping it real.  What if as a show, we all go together, we reserve judgment until the show together goes  and sees the new Tyler Perry movie?  I didn't even finish the sentence. 
[00:27:00]  Wow.  Thank you, Stephanie.  No problem.  Thank you, sister.  In the theater.  How do you know Stephanie's a sister?  I was trying to figure that out.  Stephanie, are you a sister?  Dialect.  We lost her.  Dialect.  I heard a certain dialect.  Did you?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  All right.  I'm good at that, by the way.  We've been great at that for years.  I know.  We've never missed out.  We're perfect on it as far as that goes.  Even when certain people try not so hard.  They can't escape you.  They can't escape me.  No.  That's why we know you're black, Sam. 
[00:27:30]  Well, I mean, I don't have anything.  There's no DNA to match that theory.  You know how they got gaydar?  Some people have gaydar.  I have endar.  Okay.  Yeah.  I know what the N stands for.  Yeah.  N-person.  That's right, Larry.  Larry King.  N-person.  You should really...  Larry gets excited.  He wants to participate.  Be a little more tolerant.  He loves participating.  He pipes up in the show.  They're calling you Anthony Bunker now, Ant.  But look, Tyler Perry's bad.  That's a compliment.  No, I'm not.  I heard you heard.  Oh, thanks.  Thank you. 
[00:28:00]  Well, I mean, Tyler Perry using color.  That means it's...  That word's back on the...  I mean, it depends on the...  It's back on the table for Whitey.  Context and the...  Yeah.  Like when Chris Rock used the N-word, whereas maybe...  Did he use it in the title of a movie?  No.  Well, it's a little different.  He could use it in his act.  Yeah.  We've already conceded the fact that black people can use the N-word in their act, and  we, you know, cannot use it.  Right.  Just coming from a different place.  In context, like if I'm quoting my father and what he said to me, I'm going to use it 
[00:28:30]  because that's what it was said.  I'm not using it to, you know, infling people.  No.  I'm not using it as a derogatory term.  Your father was.  Me.  My father was.  Yes, indeed.  But you just quoted.  I am exposing the fact that I was raised in a very racist environment.  Yes.  And I came out fine.  Well.  And it just shows that people can move on from that, even if they're raised in a very  racist environment.  It proves the apple theory, I really... 
[00:29:00]  Oh, it doesn't fall far from the tree?  That old apple theory.  Oh.  So you're trying to display how you have progressed.  I call it the watermelon doesn't fall far from the patch.  Okay.  It's different.  Or the eggplant doesn't fall far from the vine.  Let's...  There are as many fruit and vegetables analogies we can make.  It doesn't always have to be an apple.  I know why you're picking those plants.  Stephanie's back.  And guess what, Anthony?  You were wrong.  Oh.  Well, she probably hangs out with a lot of sisters if she knew that.  She picked up the dialect. 
[00:29:30]  You ever watch Maury?  Yes.  Sometimes a pearly white girl will walk down those stairs and start going like,  Eh, what the hell are you talking about?  I wasn't with that man.  That's not my child.  That's not...  And you're like, what happened?  Sometimes...  Are they dubbing it like a Japanese movie?  And then sometimes a black person comes out and speaks well-spoken.  Oh, completely articulate and well-spoken.  And you're like, what is this?  What is this?  That they do that thing where they put the dome on each other's heads and cross their brainwaves  like dudes? 
[00:30:00]  It's a movie comedy.  Yes, it is.  Starring Eddie Murphy and Eddie Murphy.  I think Anthony couldn't sleep last night because of this color thing.  It got you really excited, huh?  That got me excited.  It got you extremely excited.  I was wringing my hands looking at the clock.  It allows you to, you know, spew some of your feelings and your views.  For colored girls.  My views.  Stephanie, you're not Blake.  Nope.  Have you ever slept with a black guy, though? 
[00:30:30]  No, actually.  Where were you born and raised?  Born in Monmouth County, New Jersey.  That's suspicious.  Is it?  I don't know.  I don't know.  How close to Newark is that?  All right.  Well...  What color eyes do you have?  Blue.  Very suspicious.  Blonde hair?  No, no.  Kind of reddish brown.  Ah, there you go.  Okay.  That says it right there.  All right. 
[00:31:00]  Nuff said.  I think we all know what she's saying here.  My point's been made.  We might have to go back a few generations, but, you know, we know what that's about.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Exactly.  Come on.  Blue eyes, red hair.  Stop.  Come on.  That's so obviously a black lady.  Malcolm X had red hair.  Exactly.  Detroit red.  Detroit red, they called him.  Yeah, yeah.  Black redheads are...  My dad called him something else.  They called him Detroit red.  Black redheads are just funny looking.  Malcolm X was a handsome man.  I don't know.  He looked black to me because all we saw was black and white footage of that guy. 
[00:31:30]  How do you know he had red hair?  He was black and he had red hair.  How do you know?  Because his name was Detroit red.  That's true.  But I've never seen a colored picture of him.  They were colored.  Don't use that.  Oh, no, you can now.  Okay.  All right, you're right.  You can use it.  Not with Brother Malcolm, no?  Brother Malcolm looked like just a regular black guy because of the black and white footage.  Well, he was a regular black guy, but he did have red hair.  He looked like an intellectual, though.  He was intellectual.  With the glasses and stuff and very, you know, very well-spoken, well-read.  He sure was. 
[00:32:00]  Of course.  Of course.  All right, Stephanie, thank you.  You're welcome.  Oh, she didn't sound happy with that.  No, she's not.  You're welcome.  She's Ike.  She's Uppity.  She's Ike.  Okay, well, that's...  You know, for a white chick.  I don't know if anybody's used Uppity in a movie title yet.  Ah, for Uppity Girls.  No, Uppity Colored Girls.  No, you can't say that.  That would be a great comedy, though.  It wouldn't.  You take it too far.  I picture that as a Judd Apatow movie.  No, I don't think... 
[00:32:30]  Uppity Colored Girls.  I don't think that's...  Dude, how funny would a movie be titled Uppity Colored Girls?  Come on!  Next time Judd's in town, you can pitch it.  But if certain people made the movie, then it would be fine.  Tyler Perry makes it.  It's gold.  You can't say Uppity.  Not in the same...  Just let me know if we're in I'm his territory.  Are we still all right?  You're way into I'm his...  Oh, yeah.  With that?  You crossed over the neutral zone.  You're into I'm his territory.  You've been swimming in it.  The Kobayashi Maru is unsavable at this point. 
[00:33:00]  It's just one step further than for Colored Girls.  Right.  And now we're just...  We're just replacing four and putting it up in here.  That's a big step.  That was a big, giant step for mankind.  Yes.  Why?  You leaped into I'm his territory.  Yeah, you did.  You didn't even cross the border.  You jumped over it with a pole vault.  Maybe I jumped over I'm his dying body, though.  No.  Oh, my God.  Don't speak of Mr. I'm his like that, Mr. I'm his.  We love the I'm his.  Hey, how you doing? 
[00:33:30]  I'm Mr. Morning, Iowa.  That was my pal.  Don't be an athlete.  All right.  I think he's sucking up to us.  He wants us to be these pallbearers or some shit.  You think I'm his is excited about the Tyler Perry title?  Oh, he's very...  He can't steer more clear of that type of face.  He wants to talk so bad about it.  New Tyler Perry movie.  Oh, shut my mic off.  Got a button there.  Put my juice on it.  I didn't say juice.  It's my person's juice.  I need to keep the job. 
[00:34:00]  I don't think I can live to get another one.  Poor I, man.  Wow.  So I can't say that even as a joke?  No, no.  Not as a joke.  Right.  Why can't you say that as a joke?  It's offensive.  Because jokes like that are hurtful and offensive.  To who?  To African Americans.  Black people.  You could say black people.  Colored girls.  No, that's where...  Well, it's four colored girls.  So if you say colored girls and I say uppity.  I don't know if either one, depending on the subtext, is appropriate.  No, no, no.  Look, we're working on a brand new Abbott and Costello type bit here.  Oh, okay. 
[00:34:30]  I'm sorry.  I'm getting it away.  Great.  You say colored, I say uppity.  Yeah, that's not a good...  You say tomato, I say tomato.  Why?  That's going to be the title of the CD.  CD?  Which you say colored, I say uppity.  No, no, no.  I won't.  It's a new comedy CD by your pals, Opie and Anthony.  You are treading on dangerous ground, my friend.  You're swimming in the cold water that used to be covered by thin ice.  Yeah, yes, exactly.  Thank you.  I think we should move on.  Wow, really?  Yeah.  Oh, yes.  Yeah.  Really?  I think we should just move on from this. 
[00:35:00]  Really?  I don't need any more issues.  But you started it.  You used the N-word.  I used it to describe what my father said to me after he smacked me in the face.  This is a scene in a movie.  This could be a scene in a movie.  My childhood should absolutely be a movie.  People would walk out of there crying in their eyes.  Crying.  Anthony Coombe, The American Dream.  That's the title. 
[00:35:30]  It could be The American Dream because I then somehow got over that and turned the tears  to laughter.  I can't stop!  My father smacked me for having black person hair and for stealing quarters to buy ice cream  sandwiches because he wasn't feeding me and I was starving.  That's two minutes of a movie.  That's smacked right there.  You need 88 more minutes. 
[00:36:00]  All the other filling in is him saying things, teaching me the lingo, just not being very...  Spaghetti plate incident.  Spaghetti plate incident where he threw the spaghetti at the wall.  That's three minutes.  You still need 87 minutes.  The big fuck face fight where my father smacked my mother and she chased him around the house  with a knife calling him fuck face.  You fuck face.  You fuck face.  And I was in the room trying to cover my ears because I shouldn't hear that word and I'm 
[00:36:30]  crying.  You get out, you fuck face.  You fuck face.  That's two minutes.  Now this is a Judd Apatow movie.  And it goes on and on.  I don't want to...  You need 85 more minutes.  I don't want to give away the whole movie.  All right.  Well, fair enough.  But believe me, there's a two, three hour movie.  Can I work in an uppity scene?  I don't know.  All right.  Let me think if there was ever an uppity scene.  Give me...  Yes.  All right.  Give me like five minutes in your movie to work in an uppity scene.  Uppity scene?  Yeah.  Okay.  I'll be the uppity expert. 
[00:37:00]  All right.  It was at a...  We were going into New York City.  And for some reason, my father just didn't have the proper toll money.  Why would he?  I know.  Exactly.  Why would he?  He didn't have a dime in his pocket.  So did he punch you because he didn't have enough change?  Yeah, that probably wasn't his fault.  No, he took it out on the African-American toll taker.  Oh, my God.  Who he said, look, I'm trying...  He made up some story about I had to go to New York. 
[00:37:30]  I think I had to go to the medical center or something in New York.  He was telling the guy.  And meanwhile, we were just going to some bar to meet up with his friend Jimmy.  And he didn't have the money, and he just wanted to get through.  And the black person in there, my father would interpret him as being uppity because  he wasn't letting my father through at the time.  But your father didn't have the money.  Well, uh...  How short was he?  And it was cheap back then.  It was...  It couldn't be more than a quarter.  It was just like a quarter or something like that.  So...  He couldn't find a quarter? 
[00:38:00]  I summarily got tossed into the back seat where I had to push...  You know the big bench seats in the front?  You pushed them forward?  Sure.  I had to push them forward and sort through dried up french fries and dust to try to  find coins that had perhaps fallen in the seat.  Just to pay the toll.  So how was he going to pay for his boobs?  And I was able to.  I was able to find that.  Well, Jimmy would be paying for his boobs.  Oh, Jesus.  I've talked to Jimmy years later.  I still occasionally see him.  And the Joey stories... 
[00:38:30]  The Joey Cumia stories are non-stop.  He would be...  He'd get a writing credit in the movie.  So I got the quarter and he gave it to the guy with a little passing comment.  And it started with, here you go, you fucking...  And I think you could fill in the rest as the rear wheels of the Rambler peeled out  and we went on our way.  So, yeah.  Yeah.  By the way, Jordan gave me a great idea. 
[00:39:00]  Can I get the number for Pixar?  Why is that?  Uppity.  You want to...  That's not a good sequel.  No, I have a movie called Up.  Yeah.  You don't want to call...  All right.  So why not Uppity?  A black version of Up.  Because that's offensive.  An animation.  That keeps everyone calm.  My movie has to be animated.  Animated does tame it down a notch.  A notch, but there is a history of very racist cartoons.  Get Pixar on the phone.  I know.  I got them all.  Yeah, I bet.  Old Bugs Bunnies and stuff.  I got my meal ticket out of here with my new movie, Uppity, an animated feature. 
[00:39:30]  I don't think it'll work.  That's going to be put out by Pixar.  Get them on the phone.  I'm serious.  I got a great idea.  I don't have their phone number.  Huh?  I don't have their phone number.  You wouldn't go see an animated feature?  I would not see the movie Uppity by Pixar, no.  Why?  It's a colored movie.  I know.  I wouldn't be offended.  I wouldn't go see it.  All right.  Well, you got a movie in here.  I got a hell of a movie in me.  Don't forget the cross-country trip you and your brother.  Cross-country trip.  That's another five minutes. 
[00:40:00]  With, yeah, Pops driving down a dark, lonely road in the middle of the United States of  America in a Pinto runabout.  A little Pinto.  People are reminding you, because we've got to get to 90 minutes.  Benjamin.  Benjamin.  Hey.  Hey.  Anthony, don't forget the sexy scene of the shower.  Ah, the shower scene.  I mean, this will make it rated R, though.  Well?  This has to be a full frontal nudity with a man.  Where the water was waterfalling over your dad's can. 
[00:40:30]  And you were beneath that, showering.  I wonder who would play my dad.  Maybe like Benicio Del Toro.  Oh.  That would be good.  He could be a nice, angry guy.  Yeah.  He speaks English a lot better.  He kind of looks like a younger version of my dad.  They'd have to bald him up a little bit, though.  Yeah, the Hispanic Brad Pitt, right?  That guy?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Yeah, he could probably play my Pops.  He would be perfect.  I'd have to get, like, some poor, little, innocent, whiny kid to play me. 
[00:41:00]  Some kid that could cry on cue, man.  They'll be fucking, I mean, just crying, like, he just put crying faggot in this.  And, man, a lot of guys come up.  Jesus.  Yeah, I need some kind of little kid.  Are there any, like, little fucking, like, what's his name, from Sixth Sense?  Are there any of those kids around anymore?  That kid's about 30 now.  I know, I know.  I'm just saying, are there any more of those?  They need a new crop of those little crying kids.  Maybe, yeah, we could figure something out.  I need something like that. 
[00:41:30]  What about that little kid?  There's a little kid on Modern Family who could probably pull it off, I think.  Yeah, I could pull it off.  I think so.  All right, all right.  And then my mom would be played by...  We need, like, a young, wild redhead girl.  Oh, yeah, you got that one.  There's one in Hollywood.  Oh, John Turturro should be my dad.  Oh, that one, okay.  That's a good one.  Very good.  John Turturro's my dad.  Can we get Betty White for the older version of your mom?  No, my mom doesn't look like Betty White. 
[00:42:00]  Okay, John Turturro's perfect for my dad.  Oh, yeah, he is.  Oh, that's perfect.  Okay.  He's got the right attitude.  Yeah, yeah, John Turturro could smack a kid.  He's used the word uppity a few times in his life.  Is Susan Sarandon too old?  Too old.  My mother was actually, like, hot back in the day.  So you need kind of a wild redhead, but that could really be depressed and downtrodden  because she's miserable.  Don't forget the Treefort scene.  Oh, the Richard Treefort scene. 
[00:42:30]  Who would play Richard?  Oh, my God.  Has to be a handsome homosexual.  Lance Bass.  No, he's too...  Oh, get the old intern.  Oh, my God.  And Sean?  Lindsay Lohan's playing my mom.  Lindsay Lohan.  Holy shit, that's perfect.  Oh, that's great.  Yeah, because she'd be drinking and shit.  Oh, that would be great.  Lindsay Lohan, John Turturro, the little kid for me.  And who would play John?  Let's see. 
[00:43:00]  My brother's got to be in there, too.  My sister.  Oh, my God.  The casting's great, though.  I like this.  Look, we don't have to figure it all out in one hour.  I know.  I know.  This is a...  That's true.  This is a project now.  Oh, people are saying the role of Richard?  Yeah.  Sam.  You think me?  I think Sam...  ...should play...  No, you're actually...  Richard was very cute.  Oh.  Anthony.  Yeah.  Your movie's obviously taking precedent over my movie, so can mine be...  Oh, shit.  Can mine be like a five, seven minute little animated feature before your movie?  A little feature?  A short?  Yeah.  Like the Pixar light that comes out in the beginning of the movie? 
[00:43:30]  Yeah.  It'll be Pixar, and they'll say, uppity.  I see it.  I see it.  And then we seg into yours, and the two movies are related, obviously.  This is terrible.  Well, as Opie, Owen Wilson, or Ellen DeGeneres.  This is terrible.  That's uncone.  I don't grow my hair out.  Come on, now.  I don't grow my hair out anymore, so no more Ellen DeGeneres jokes, please.  That's terrible.  Which means I just bought myself two more years of Ellen DeGeneres jokes.  I know how this works.  Ah, shit.  And now that I've broken my nose three times, I'm... 
[00:44:00]  You're getting close.  You're getting close.  One more breaking, and you're there.  Oh, shit.  You could start fucking signing autographs when you're out and take pictures of him.  Oh, fuck.  Wow, I really see this moving.  What about that one of the gay kids from Glee playing Richard?  Is that...  I don't think there's anyone pretty enough.  What about that kid?  Let me see.  All right, Matt.  He's tussleable and cute.  He might be able to play Richard.  Would you if no one's looking? 
[00:44:30]  Jesse in Houston's got a great idea.  Jesse in Houston.  Jesse.  Jesse.  Yes, I'm seeing the Italian version of Precious here.  Yeah, yeah.  It kind of is.  Nice.  The Italian version of Precious.  Yeah.  How great is that?  It could even be billed as that.  Oh, and we got another scene for your movie coming in.  See, they're all reminding us here.  Vinny, go ahead.  Staten Island.  I was going to say, how about who's going to play the Mexican that tried to molest you? 
[00:45:00]  But more importantly, who's going to play Mookie Wilson, Anthony, who...  My mother was never with Mookie Wilson.  Oh, my God.  She was with Ed Glynn.  Ed Glynn, failed pitcher for the Mets back in the 80s.  We're allowed to talk about that finally, 10 years later?  Sal can't beat up anyone anymore.  All right, good.  You're safe.  All right, good.  Is Sal going to be in the movie, or will it be more focusing on the earlier years?  I think it'll probably go right up to the Sal years, and then it'll be a sequel. 
[00:45:30]  Who will play older Anthony in the sequel?  I'm thinking Antonio Banderas.  You want the guy that played Magneto to play Sal?  Oh, that's a great idea.  That's pretty good.  The guy that played Gandalf?  Yeah, that's pretty good.  Could play Sal when he first got into the picture?  Can he pull off a Baltimore accent?  I don't know.  That's pretty good.  And the Mexican.  There's some scary Mexican actors out there.  Oh, I want fucking...  Danny Trejo.  Yeah, that's the one.  Danny Trejo plays the guy that tried to molest me. 
[00:46:00]  In his machete outfit.  But wait, but wait a minute.  There's the guy.  Oh, my God.  We got a movie.  But John Turturro has to be able to beat up Danny Trejo and make it happen?  That doesn't seem realistic.  He's deceivingly short.  Danny Trejo.  Danny Trejo.  Yeah, raped you.  That's hilarious.  Hey, why don't we go into the bushes?  That's what the guy asked me.  I know.  We all know him.  He came up to me at Chato's Ranch. 
[00:46:30]  We need someone to play Chato, too.  I need a shitload of Mexicans for this picture.  A shitload of Mexicans.  Hold on.  We got more.  We just got to go in front of a Home Depot.  We got more shit coming in.  Chris the teacher.  Chris.  Hey, guys.  How we doing?  All right?  Amen.  What about Rosie O'Donnell and Dreamweaver and a really strong horse?  Too old.  Oh, that's perfect.  Too old.  No.  No.  That's perfect.  You are.  That's perfect.  You're casting too old.  You're casting sucks.  I need a young fat girl.  They got nice lenses nowadays. 
[00:47:00]  They can make Rosie look youthful.  No.  You know.  Who's a young fat girl?  There's a show called Huge.  It was canceled, but it was about Fat Camp.  It was the same girl who was in the movie Hairspray.  She's a big, giant, fat actress.  And she's young.  Get her.  Get her.  Yeah, she's great.  I want her in this picture.  She's dark hair.  That's fine, right?  That's perfect.  Okay.  Can I do a casting for you?  Yes.  I got one.  Jane Lynch.  Jane Lynch.  That's her name, right?  Yeah.  Who is she?  As Buzz.  Oh, Buzz!  I need a very tall, big-boned-but-not-fat girl. 
[00:47:30]  That's a perfect Dreamweaver.  There you go.  That girl from fucking Hairspray.  That's perfect.  Yes.  Get her.  This is amazing.  And she's hot right now.  She's the it fat girl right now.  It fat girl?  Mm-hmm.  And so I'll have to punch that scene up.  It'll have to be a little longer in the movie.  Yeah, maybe some scenes with her as your neighbor.  Actually, it was long.  We did go up in the hills.  We went horseback riding.  Oh, my God.  She's perfect.  She looks just like her. 
[00:48:00]  That's Dreamweaver.  That's my Dreamweaver right there.  This is great.  That's right there.  And then, okay, Buzz has to be the...  And she's the one that took my virginity when I was 13 years old.  Jane Lynch might be a little too old now.  She's got to be in her early 20s.  Oh, boy.  Or it could be mid-20s, but she's got to look like...  Yeah, she's got to look...  She was only 19, but she looked like she was in her mid-20s.  Okay.  Big girl.  Big bone girl.  Go ahead.  Big tits. 
[00:48:30]  Full-figured gal, but not fat.  Opie?  Snooki.  Oh, this is great!  What the hell?  Snooki!  No!  Snooki is buzzed!  No!  No!  You just described Snooki.  That could be...  She was taller than Snooki, though, but they could do...  Ah, we'll put her in heels.  And she really only has to be in bed.  It'll make her ass almost look good if you put her in heels.  Plus, that's a big casting.  I mean, she's, again, another it girl right now.  But I don't want to make it a gimmicky Snooki's in it movie. 
[00:49:00]  Well, it's just a cameo.  And then I'd have to be in bed with Snooki?  No, you're the actor.  So whoever...  Oh, whoever's playing me, I'm all of a sudden thinking it's private parts.  And I'm pompous enough to play myself!  Wow.  Wow.  She put on an afro, wait.  Tracy Morgan has Mookie Wilson?  My mom was never with Mookie!  Who plays Teenage Anthony? 
[00:49:30]  Teenage Anthony.  The situation.  You need somebody who isn't allergic to massive amounts of zit makeup on their face.  Because it would have to be somebody that's either really in life broken out very badly,  or can sit in a makeup chair for hours like they're putting on Wolfman makeup.  What if we put zit makeup on Zac Efron?  Zac Efron?  Yeah, Zac Efron.  Why are you being such an ass kisser?  I don't think...  What do you mean?  I don't think...  Zac Efron's the it guy right now.  Zac Efron's gonna work out. 
[00:50:00]  We're trying to make a big budget, major motion picture.  F. Murray Abraham, shut up!  F. Murray Abraham.  We're trying to sell movie tickets here.  I know.  This is perfect.  Oh my god, Chyna as Buzz.  Yeah, that's coming in too.  That would be perfect.  She would be the perfect Buzz.  She's got a cock.  You don't have to see that.  You don't have to see that.  And she asked me to go down on her, and I refused. 
[00:50:30]  Buzz, not Chyna.  And they want Craig Robinson as Patrice for the radio years.  Steve from Jersey.  No, we need a very curly-haired kind of awkward...  What about the kid from Super...  Not from Superbad.  From that superhero movie that just came out with the kids.  Oh, oh.  With Nick Cage.  Yeah, that might work.  Have you seen him in real life?  That might work.  What about McFly?  No, no, no, no.  No, no.  That kid right there. 
[00:51:00]  Which kid?  That kid could do it, right?  God, that's...  No, no, not Shia LaBeouf.  The kid from the superhero movie.  From Kick-Ass.  The kid from Kick-Ass.  The kid from Kick-Ass.  He's the perfect guy.  Yeah, yeah.  Or the kid from...  Is it the same kid from Zombieland?  No, but he's another very...  The kid from Zombieland would be very good.  He was in a Facebook movie.  Very good.  Yeah.  All right, I'm digging it.  I'm digging it.  I'm digging the casting on this.  I'm digging the stories.  I'm seeing it.  I'm seeing it in my head.  We gotta get Judd Apatow in here right away. 
[00:51:30]  Oh, perfect!  Come on!  That's perfect!  Jesse Eisenberg.  Yeah, they just gotta, like...  Throw tomato sauce on his face through a tennis racket.  And then send him out into life.  Perfect.  Oh, God, does that kid work perfectly.  Get him on the phone!  Make this happen!  Where's my uppity movie, then?  It'll be a trailer.  Like what they did with the fake trailers on the fucking movie that Tarantino put out.  I already conceded to make it a ten-minute feature.  You'll have a huge part... 
[00:52:00]  In part two.  I don't want...  I don't want any of that.  In the sequel.  Yeah.  It'll be huge.  Oh, my God.  Who plays the ex-wife?  Whoa.  Now, that...  That has to go up...  It probably would go up to that point.  To right where I get married.  Because that's...  The divorce becoming the sequel.  Early in the cell years.  That's that.  And then the working.  I think right up to where radio starts becoming an issue. 
[00:52:30]  Then the movie ends.  Would you put a trailer for...  Right where my ex-wife tells me I shouldn't take the job in Boston.  Because it's 500 a year less than working my balls off knocking ten.  Well, that was a smart move.  Yeah, yeah.  If we're going to cast her, why don't we put wild boar in the Google image search?  Yeah, and you could spell it either way.  Boar or boar.  Oh, perfect.  We've got plenty to choose from.  All right.  That's perfect.  That looks just like her.  That's great.  Are you going to put a trailer for the sequel at the end of the first one, like Back to the Future? 
[00:53:00]  Yes.  You've got to film them both at the same time so the trailer's ready.  Get everybody excited.  Perfect.  Coming next summer.  Coming next summer.  Anthony Cummion on American Dream Part 2.  I want...  To be continued.  Yes.  Like that.  And then to be concluded.  You need a Part 3?  No.  No.  That's being written as we speak.  Because that always becomes a Western.  That's being written as we speak.  It's me drunk and destitute on a park bench for someone's documentary.  Hopefully F.U.  Money. 
[00:53:30]  Will you get your F.U.  Money so we can take some more chances?  I'm getting it tonight.  Yeah.  At the casino.  Hopefully by Monday...  Hopefully by Monday you get your F.U.  Money back and then we can start taking chances.  Yay.  All right.  We should take a break.  We got the movie cast.  Oh, my God.  It's cast.  This is going to be a great movie.  It really is.  Get this moving.  Yep.  We should.  Yeah.  Get it moving.  We should do it.  This is huge.  We should do that.  Anthony Cummion on American Dream.  An American Dream.  All right.  And I'll just...  Oh, it'll be...  The trailer could be great because it's just nothing but violence and abuse. 
[00:54:00]  And racism.  And a lot of racism.  Yeah, a lot.  Oh, my God.  Tarantino would go like, hey, tame it down a bit.  Tame it down.  Why don't you get him to direct it?  Yeah, who's going to direct?  That would...  You need some action.  Do you think a Tarantino would be good for this?  Well, he likes to write his own stuff.  I don't know if you want to let him write...  Well, I wouldn't think of myself as being a writer, like, that I could write the entire  movie.  He just...  He tends to reimagine things.  Oh. 
[00:54:30]  And you wouldn't...  You'd want a little more creative control than that.  Believe me, this could use accuracy.  Yeah.  This doesn't really need to be punched up that much.  I think if you partnered with Judd Apatow...  Yeah?  It would take him to a darker place that he'd probably like to go to.  Yeah, you would think he'd like to...  Whoa!  Whoa, whoa, whoa.  I already have him for my movie.  Oh, shit.  Well, I don't know if he'll do Oppity.  Oppity?  You don't know if he's going to do Oppity?  I don't know that he'll do Oppity, to tell you the truth.  Oppity colored...  David Fincher?  Oppity a colored movie.  Yeah, David Fincher, you think?  What?  David Fincher.  Oh, that could be great.  He did Fight Club? 
[00:55:00]  Yeah, you're more of a Fincher guy.  He did the social network.  And apparently he follows me on Twitter.  What?  Yes.  The Finch?  Yeah.  We'll call him.  We'll get in touch with him.  And why can't we get the Finch on the show?  Well, there's a long, long gap between following on Twitter and getting someone on the show.  Why?  Let's get some of these people that follow us on Twitter on the fucking show.  Ah, people are saying, look, Kevin Smith.  I think it's too close.  I think he's too close.  Yeah, and there'd have to be a Jay and Silent Bob cameo. 
[00:55:30]  Right, right.  A Jay and Silent Bob.  A cameo.  Oh, Jay and Dad would go to the bar and Jay and Silent Bob would be there outside.  We've got to take a break because we've got a busy show.  Yeah.  Is Dr. Steve here yet?  Dr. Mike.  Dr. Steve.  It's your old pal, Dr. Steve.  We've got Dr. Steve here.  We've got Dr. Mike here.  We've got, is Big A here?  Big A is here.  We want Big A to do some news today because we have a very busy show, so we want to at 
[00:56:00]  least get the news out there for everybody.  I haven't done that in a while.  Oh, because, you know, we're a show that's all about what's happening out there.  But we'll have to make sure Big A does it quick because we don't have a lot of time.  And do we have time to do a quick Jocktober after the break, Sam?  I mean, maybe.  Are you directing the show today, Sam?  I will direct if you want to.  Wow.  Jocktober is, I mean, I really like the show that we're doing today, so if you want to  hold off until Monday, we hold off until Monday.  We'll see how Big A does with the news.  That means less work for you.  Yes.  That's true.  But I'm directing today, so. 
[00:56:30]  That means you can save the fucking Jocktober you have for today for Monday.  But it's less air time for Sam, and you know how Sam doesn't like that at all.  I don't like that at all.  Sam is definitely soaking in the air time.  Oh, God.  Enough already.  All right.  We'll figure it out.  After the break, we're definitely going to do some news with Big A.  Bobo is here.  He brought some donuts.  And his penis.  Yeah, that's what I want.  The thought of donuts and his penis.  Nicole from the morning mashup yesterday told me that she would like to see Bobo's penis.  All right.  I got the bit.  I got the bit.  He's got donuts and he's got his penis. 
[00:57:00]  I got $100.  I say we bet how many fucking donuts he could put on his fucking penis.  One.  One.  All right.  Then I'll take the bet.  No, you'd have to take one to a table saw.  What?  Travis?  Hey, what's the suit doing in here, by the way?  Yeah, I don't know.  What's the suit doing in here?  I don't know what the boss man is doing.  Travis, hey.  Travis, shouldn't you be down the hall with your fucking suit and tie on and shit?  What's the matter?  What's the matter?  I thought you were banned from any of the fun places in the building. 
[00:57:30]  Travis is like...  He just put his finger in his mouth and...  What were we saying about Bobo?  Well, we called him...  Coming to my Halloween party?  Yes.  Cool.  Yes.  Sam, you coming?  I wasn't invited.  You're invited.  Maybe I will, then.  You bring in Jess?  Yeah, I mean, that's who I would...  That's what I'm just saying.  Okay.  My girl will be there, too.  Don't worry about me.  What?  I found a babysitter.  You found a babysitter?  So people have known about this Halloween party for a while, obviously.  No, it actually popped up... 
[00:58:00]  You actually got asked first.  And you're...  The day I had it planned, it got tweeted.  And I was like, having a Halloween party.  And you said, I got a wedding.  Listen to him stumble around.  Thank you, Danny.  At least you acknowledged it.  Thank you.  You didn't invite me to no fucking Halloween party.  I did, and you have a wedding.  I did.  Don't you remember three weeks when I said it?  I told you, and you said you had a wedding.  When is the Halloween party?  The 30th.  I have a wedding on the 30th, you fucking lunatic.  Saturday the 30th? 
[00:58:30]  I get it.  You don't want me there.  No, you're welcome, then.  Please come.  I have a wedding today.  Okay.  I have a wedding next Saturday.  My cousin Michelle's getting married next Saturday.  Oh, then it's Saturday after?  I remember when she was a little thing running around the beach, and we used to sing, Michelle...  Yeah.  Whatever.  Gotta dress up, though.  I'm married.  What?  Gotta dress up.  I don't dress up for nothing.  I'm coming as Ira.  Someone's gotta come as Ira.  You're invited, Marissa. 
[00:59:00]  Shit, you fucking...  Big Halloween party on the 30th.  What an attention whore.  I'm...  All right.  You gotta hear the Bobo Scoop, though.  What?  We called him yesterday and told him to bring donuts.  Well, no, he said, I'm gonna bring donuts.  I'm gonna bring donuts.  I bring donuts.  And so first we told him to bring two dozen donuts, one dozen strawberry-frosted, and then  one dozen assorted, and he said, okay.  And then this morning, he called us, and Travis told him to bring four dozen donuts. 
[00:59:30]  Oh, God.  And guess how many donuts he brought?  Four.  One.  Four dozen.  Oh, he don't...  Four dozen donuts.  How long was he there?  How long was he there just stumbling?  I don't know which to pick.  Well, because he was supposed to be here at five, and then he didn't show up until 6.30,  so Travis told him he better bring four dozen donuts.  And plus...  Plus, he promised us all presents because he trashed us on Ron and Fez during the hypnotism show.  Right, right.  Yes, yes.  And he still hasn't gotten us the presents, so I said, well...  Are they sealed, the boxes? 
[01:00:00]  Yes.  Why, you want donuts?  In iron?  Oh, no, no.  No, I would never have a donut from Bobo.  Yeah, I'm going to get one of them strawberry-frosted.  Oh, I'm going to get a lot of donuts.  Well, let's get the fucking donuts in here.  Let's take a break.  I'm having a sandwich.  And we're going to figure out some shit for after the break.  Ah, that sounds like a plan.  Oh, really fast.  I forgot.  I told him I'd give him a plug today.  Break.com.  Yeah.  Put up my video where we're all scaring the shit out of intern Stevie.  Right on their front fucking page. 
[01:00:30]  Oh, speaking of people who might have gotten you sick.  Stevie's sick?  Oh, asshole showed up in the lobby today, this morning.  Yeah.  And then he went home.  And so I started calling him on his cell.  He didn't pick up his cell.  Finally, he called me back and left me a voicemail saying that he was sick, that he had gotten to work.  Yeah, he was here.  And realized he was sick, he had stomach problems and throat problems, and he just had diarrhea in the bathroom at Penn Station, and then did. 
[01:01:00]  So I'm really sad, but I'm going to have to go.  Meanwhile, our intern Joe, he completely destroyed his car on the way here.  He got into a car accident.  His car was totaled.  Wow.  So he got a ride from the police officer to the train station and showed up here before 6.  There's a trooper right there.  Even though his car is totaled somewhere?  His car is totaled.  On the side of the road, he said, fuck that, I still got to get in?  Damn.  Although the officer is a big fan of Opie and Anthony and Opie's eye. 
[01:01:30]  Well, let's say hello to that officer.  Yes, sir.  We'll just call him that officer.  Yeah, so.  All right, no Stevie today.  That sucks.  I wanted to fucking fuck with him today.  But Break.com, front page, all of us scaring the shit out of Stevie.  And it's not fake.  Fake, so fake, totally fake.  At this point, it's exhausting.  I can't deal with those fucking assholes anymore.  It's not.  They're all yelling and screaming, fake.  It's not fake.  The guy's a lunatic.  Yes.  But then there's people really mad because they're convinced he has Down syndrome. 
[01:02:00]  I can't fight these battles with these assholes.  I can't deny that.  Just enjoy the video.  It's made it to Break.com on the front page, which is pretty impressive.  He hasn't been diagnosed.  Thank you to those guys.  He hasn't been diagnosed with Down syndrome.  We've been told he doesn't have Down syndrome, but he has something else going on.  He obviously was, I don't know.  I think he was molested as a kid.  Do you think so?  He's definitely beaten up.  So now he's kind of like a scaredy cat.  And by the way, whoever said he has Gary Shandling mouth is dead on.  Because now I can't look at Stevie without looking at his mouth. 
[01:02:30]  That was me.  That was it.  That was me.  He does have Gary Shandling mouth.  It's exactly Gary Shandling.  Yeah, yeah.  I thought that the second he walked in, I was like, ew.  I've never seen lips move like that.  What the fuck is going on?  Very cool.  All right.  So let's do Big A News, I'm thinking.  Abby!  We've got a lot of things to choose from, but I think the Big A News is a hit.  We haven't done it in a while.  Now that my movie's cast, I'm fine.  I don't care what we do.  You've got your future set.  Fuck yeah.  And then I think we're going to squeeze in Jocktober, too.  Jocktober!  And then we'll get into what the hell is that with Dr. Steve and Dr. Mike. 
[01:03:00]  What a full show.  And we've got Vic Henley coming back today.  Thank God.  Very funny comic.  Yes, he was good.  Very good.  All right.  From O&A Pictures comes a true story of one man's pain.  It does hurt.  And a family torn apart.  And it makes you feel really funny right after it happens.  The War of the Kumias.  I had the yelling parents, too, growing up until they got divorced.  And it was just, you know.  And then you'd see, like, the old man would take the plate full of spaghetti and throw it. 
[01:03:30]  And it would hit, like, the wall next to the phone.  And you're sitting there, horrified, watching the spaghetti slowly go down the wall.  Fuck you.  Get the fuck out of the wall.  Fuck you.  Oh, the horrified kids.  Did Dad actually leave after the fights?  Yeah, a lot of times, sure.  And then, you know, you'd be able to go to sleep because the yelling would stop.  First, Mom would have to wind down a little.  That fucking asshole.  You know, even after Dad left, she's still going.  Eat that shit like I need a fucking hole in the head.  I'm trying to sleep. 
[01:04:00]  He's gone.  Son of a bitch.  Shut up.  Come in here.  Shut up.  That way.  Oh, God, he's been gone a half hour.  When would he come back?  The next day?  Yeah, like, the next day.  You know, they'd be sitting down watching, like, Ronan Martin's laughing.  Laughing.  Everything was fine.  You know?  And then out of nowhere, you'd hear the rumbling.  You'd be in bed, and you'd be like,  And then you'd hear from the kid's room.  Can't you two just shut the fuck up for, like, one night? 
[01:04:30]  And then we were pretty young, so, you know, we got, you know, called into the room, and  Mom sits down and goes,  Me and your father, I want you to know, and I want you to know it has nothing to do with  you, we're divorced.  Oh, okay.  Can I go out and play now?  How is this going to change my life?  Does this mean I don't have to listen to...  Oh, it does?  Okay.  So it's a good thing.  Great.  Well, thank you for staying together for so long and really, like, torturing us. 
[01:05:00]  You couldn't have pulled this one, like, five years ago?  Yeah, fucking asshole.  When maybe we couldn't remember as much and didn't have to listen to the yelling and screaming?  No way.  Here's an idea, Pop.  There you go.  Right back into the Huntington boat ramp.  Give that a whirl.  The War of the Cummias.  You've got to figure you're going to just sit there disgusted having to listen to this crap.  Hello?  Hey, Angel Face.  Get in touch with the O.P. Anthony Show. 
[01:05:30]  Call 866-WOW-1-WOW.  That's 866-969-1969.  I guess we play that because there's going to be a Top Gun sequel.  What?  Mm-hmm.  Let me guess.  We're all black cast.  Ah!  Ah! 
[01:06:00]  With a small Maverick cameo, no one's going to see this shit.  Save your money.  What?  Oh, really?  Who would see that?  Um, an actual sequel?  I'll wait for it on cable.  It's going to be one of those sequels where there's nobody from the original cast, really,  except for, like they said, a tiny little cameo here just so you go, oh, yeah, that's right.  This is a sequel.  Ah.  Hey, we're getting some very disturbing news.  It just never ends around here. 
[01:06:30]  We'll make a quick amp.  But, uh, we love Ira.  We imitate Ira.  Ira's been nothing but, uh, great on our show.  Yes.  He's a Jay Thomas guy, which we say every time he's in here from the Jay Thomas show, Ira.  So, so if you're Jay Thomas, that's good for you because we're, we're pushing people to maybe,  uh, listen to your horse shit.  Oh.  Yeah, exactly.  Here we go.  Again.  Again.  We just learned during the break that, uh, Ira will not be on our show anytime soon. 
[01:07:00]  He's not allowed back on our show.  Somebody walked into Ira yesterday and said, uh, when are you going to be back on Opie and  Anthony?  And he said, I believe.  Jay said, I can't do the show.  I'm not allowed.  And it looks like some people behind the scenes.  Yeah.  Are once again fucking with our show. 
[01:07:30]  Mm-hmm.  And we, uh, we bring a lot of, uh, weird fucking people into this building and we do  great radio with them.  And then these people go on other shows all the time and we've never, ever put our foot  down and said, don't do anyone else's show.  You're our guy.  We don't care.  You know, half the guys end up on Rana Fez and, and, uh, some of our people end up on  other shows around here that I won't be naming right at this moment.  But all of a sudden we're taking a guy from another show, doing something completely different, 
[01:08:00]  having a good time.  It's helping our show.  And it's also promoting the show that he's part of.  Yeah.  And, uh, you know, and everyone has a problem with it.  You know, it's horseshit that we're one big happy family around here.  It's every man for themselves.  But then now we're hearing that one of our guys might've fucked up this whole thing.  Yeah.  Not one of our guys.  It's one of our guys in big, huge, fucking fat, thick quotes.  It's like, it's not one of our guys. 
[01:08:30]  It shouldn't have been questioned.  Nothing should have been said when no one was saying anything.  Is that what happened?  Yeah.  Yeah.  From what I hear.  Is this, is this Intel pretty good?  Thumbs way up on this Intel.  We have confidence.  High confidence is high.  Uh, it turns out, and we just had a meeting about this yesterday, but fuck it.  Uh, it turns out one of our babysitters might've fucked up the whole Ira thing because he's  at, he's walking around asking questions because, because he has nothing to do.  So he walks around with his coffee and goes, well, let me see how I can fuck up the Opie 
[01:09:00]  and Anthony show today.  I know I'll go to Jay Thomas and see if it's okay.  If I were does the Opie and Anthony show, it's like, but no one was asking or saying anything  bad or anything.  So why say I was been doing our show for a couple of months.  No one had a problem with it.  So why is this idiot down the hall now making it an issue when no one was bringing it up?  Yeah.  No one came to him.  He went to those guys.  And then, uh, I hear Jay went, yeah, no, I don't want that.  Yeah.  See, we should have left well enough alone.  So then, uh, the babysitter brings it back to our camp like, well, you can't use Ira anymore. 
[01:09:30]  So our point would be, why did you go over there in the first place?  No one had an issue.  Just leave it alone.  Don't find problems.  No.  Is that what happened?  That's the Intel.  That's, uh, yeah.  That's what I'm reading.  I like how Danny had to say that with a mouthful of donuts.  Oh, they're delicious donuts.  Uh, wait.  That's what I'm reading.  That's, uh, now we got, now we got, yes, a radio war on our hands. 
[01:10:00]  We absolutely have a new radio war.  And there's a lot of WTFs coming in, Anthony.  A lot of them.  Wow.  A lot of WTFs.  That means what the fuck.  And a couple of OMGs are coming in, Anthony.  On this one.  OMFG.  And a lot of no more LOLs coming in as well.  Ah.  So, uh, this is, this is a big one.  This is a biggie.  The fuck's Jay Thomas' problem?  We've, we've done nothing but support him.  We've had him on the show. 
[01:10:30]  Uh, when Ira's on, we're like, from the Jay Thomas show.  That's great marketing for him.  I'm sure it's pushed a few of our listeners over there to check out his show.  So they could hear Ira?  To hear more Ira.  They love Ira.  Yeah.  And then one of our kind of old friends, uh, which I question if he was ever one of our  friends, got involved as well, behind the scenes.  This is, this is very complicated.  You, you know who it is.  You know who it is.  Oh, wait a minute.  Write it down.  I will write it down. 
[01:11:00]  Write it down.  Because I'm trying to be better.  Here it goes.  Write it down.  And you tell me if he was ever a friend.  I want your honest opinion.  Wow.  A show friend.  Because I know you don't really have friends.  Oh, I know what you're saying.  Was he ever a friend?  I say, yes.  Was.  Was.  Many moons ago.  So you think he truly was a friend.  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  All right.  And then what happened?  And then corporate dealings came into play. 
[01:11:30]  And he chose the side of the executive, leaving us to blow in the wind.  Oh, it's not awesome, Garrett.  Dummies.  No, this has nothing to do with Garrett.  Garrett's awesome.  Yeah, we love awesome Garrett.  We would take him back in a second.  Yay.  Are we allowed to talk to him? 
[01:12:00]  I don't know.  I haven't talked to him in a while.  My God, man.  Because we work different shifts now.  But is the babysitter in question here?  He's not.  Of course.  Why would you be here?  We don't know.  It's Friday.  Why would you be here?  It's Friday.  Because someone, who we put on the case, he's not here.  So Travis or E-Rock's got to talk to him.  Because I want to hear it from him.  Handle?  I want to hear it from his mouth.  Is it true that he went over to that camp when there was not a problem, no one was questioning 
[01:12:30]  anything, to ask if it was all right?  Let's find out first.  No ifs yet.  Hold on.  I said if, though.  That's fair.  Yeah, but don't say what would be if until we know for sure.  We had a little talk yesterday.  We have to make sure everything's good first.  I don't think we were talking about those guys.  Behind the seat.  I think it was more about the company in general.  Yeah, those guys are still fair game.  Really?  Oh, yeah.  They have to be.  I didn't know that.  They have to be. 
[01:13:00]  Oh, in that case.  Especially if it's real shit.  Yeah?  Like real, real shit.  I don't understand.  But why would you go search out problems that aren't there?  I know.  That's silly.  That's really dumb.  Everyone can relate to that one, too.  If that happened.  The person in the workplace that has to go find problems.  Like, no.  Everything's fine.  Everything's fine.  Just do whatever you do.  Don't go finding.  Don't start walking the hallways to other parts of this building.  The worst thing would be to walk up to somebody and ask if something's cool. 
[01:13:30]  If no one questioned its coolness.  Because then it gives people pause to think about it and go, yeah, you know something?  No, it's not cool.  Yeah, no.  I don't want that.  Right.  And that's exactly what happened.  Yeah.  But we'll wait to see if that's the case here.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Why don't we get to Big A?  Sure.  Let's do that.  And we haven't spoken with Big A in quite a while.  Big A is usually a regular at the compound parties.  You know, The View, you got Joy Behar and Whoopi Goldberg walking out because of Bill O'Reilly. 
[01:14:00]  Yeah.  And I fucking hate Bill O'Reilly, but he's right on this one.  Yeah.  As far as how I see it, you see it the same way.  The Moss thing is really bothersome for a lot of people.  And everyone that is against the Moss being built down near ground zero understands it's  America, freedom of religion.  They understand all that shit.  They just think it's in bad taste and it's bothersome for a lot of people.  That's all he said. 
[01:14:30]  A lot of people.  And I think Bill O'Reilly said 70% of America.  Oh, she came back on the show?  Why would he do that?  If you walk, you walk.  Because Barbara Walters said after that happened on the air, she was like, I don't think they  should have walked off the set.  And they got all scared.  I bet.  Of course.  I'm like, I got to keep our cushy jobs.  Of course.  Because of stupid Barbara Walters.  But Bill O'Reilly said that 70% of Americans don't want the Moss down.  Don't want the Moss there.  And they were trying to refute that.  They're like, well, I'm an American and I want it there. 
[01:15:00]  And you show me the poll.  She's like, show me the poll.  Well, you know what?  Bill O'Reilly was looking at a legitimate poll, not talking to the same liberal cunt bag fuck  dicks that you talk to that go, I don't understand.  They're in their little cliques and they don't talk to anyone else.  That has an opposing view.  Do you think Whoopi sits there in a gaggle of conservative Republicans and actually discusses  things with them?  No.  She's surrounded by yes libs that are like, wow, the people. 
[01:15:30]  Could you believe there's people that don't want the Moss down there?  How intolerant.  And she thinks because of that, 100% of the people want the Moss down there because 100%  of the people she's with want the Moss down there.  There you go.  It's the fucking poll.  The polling has said time and time again, time and time.  But O'Reilly was giving him a piece of his mind and they just said, fuck this and we're  out of here.  Got up and walked out in there.  Show of unity.  Shut up, bitches.  Get on your fucking.  I mean, oh, I was going to say get on your rag, but menopause has claimed those wombs 
[01:16:00]  a long time ago.  Yeah, I like the Joy Behar.  I really do.  And I like the Whoopi a little bit.  But I mean, they should have hung in there and fought it out.  They were just yelling.  And I agree with Bill O'Reilly's point, even though I just don't like that fucking guy  at all.  You don't like the no spin zone of him?  He spun us around in circles the last time we were on there.  I'm still dizzy from what he did to us.  The no spin zone.  Yeah, exactly.  Yeah.  But he was talking down to him pretty badly, though, too. 
[01:16:30]  But here was their point of contention.  He said at one point, he goes, why don't you shut up and you'll learn something?  Yeah, you'll learn something.  Yeah, listen to me and you'll learn something.  Yeah, what they were pissed at is O'Reilly said, because Muslims attacked us.  Now, that's semantics, not Muslim extremists.  It's total semantics.  It was Muslims that attacked us.  He didn't say all Muslims attacked us, but he didn't say extreme Muslims attacked us.  It's true to say Muslims attacked us. 
[01:17:00]  They were all fucking Muslim.  But he should have said extreme Muslims.  No, why?  Why not?  Why?  Why not?  Why?  Because that's the second.  You're supposed to say why not again.  Oh, why not?  And then I go, why not?  And you go, why?  I gotcha.  What happened?  It's a cartoon fucking argument.  Nice.  We're doing cartoon debating.  Can we do something with Pixar with this one, too?  Yeah, to make a good trailer.  No, O'Reilly knew what he was doing, too, with the whole Muslim thing.  If you...  Well, he might have.  Well, he might have.  You're right.  I'll give you that. 
[01:17:30]  But there's no reason he should have said Muslim extremists.  He said Muslims came in here and killed people.  Right.  They did.  Right.  Terrorists...  The terrorists that are the biggest threat to us right now are Muslim terrorists.  I'm not saying Muslim extremists, because the terrorists pretty much covers that point.  I'm not saying Muslim fucking that's, you know, working, raising his family and whatnot.  Muslims came in and killed us. 
[01:18:00]  Sorry.  Sorry, Muslims.  They were your own kind.  Does that mean you're a terrorist?  No.  But it means that they were all fucking Muslims.  But the point is, if they didn't agree with that statement, they should have just fucking punched it out with them.  Yeah, talk it out, whatever.  That would have been some great TV.  But two screaming fucking bitches and him trying to raise his voice over their shit.  Hey, you were on Joy's show.  She's fine.  I have no problem with her. 
[01:18:30]  She's extremely too liberal for my liking as far as her politics go.  But, yeah, she's funny.  I've been on the show.  I had no problem with her.  Right.  But in a circumstance like that, it was bullshit.  It was fucking bullshit.  They walk off and then they come back for the second segment where, you know, he talks about his book.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  Oh, they must have looked completely stupid coming back on the set then.  Because Bob was said, I don't think they should have left.  Oh, fuck Barbara Walters.  They should not have left the show.  What are you laughing at a speech impediment joke for, dummy? 
[01:19:00]  Hi, Big A.  How are you?  Hey, how are you?  I'm fine.  We're good.  We can just cut to the show.  Yeah, yeah.  We don't even worry about trying to get that out of the way.  Um, but Barbara made them come back.  And then they had to play nice instead of, like, if they come back on the show, I would expect more fireworks.  Well, it wasn't.  It didn't get as heated.  Yeah, I didn't see that part.  And then they realized that, uh, you know, there was an issue and Barbara was a little P.O. that they left.  Oh, fuck Barbara Walters.  No.  Why does everyone kiss her?  That's dry.  But why does everyone kiss her ass in that world? 
[01:19:30]  Enough.  Because she's the boss.  Whatever.  She's the fucking boss of the show.  Enough already with her.  So what happened to Rosie, they launched her fat ass right off of that fucking show when Babs didn't like what she was saying.  Yeah, I guess.  That's too bad you gotta like her.  They trebucheted her fat fucking ass.  That's too bad you gotta kiss that old fucking ass.  Oh.  Ugh.  Yuck.  Ugh.  Just fucking Johnson's baby powder in age.  Would you ever eat an old ass?  No.  Ugh.  And I am an ass-eating fucking machine. 
[01:20:00]  When does the, uh.  At what age do you cut off the ass-eating?  At what age?  30.  Friends don't do friends.  Is 30 the big age?  30 the age.  Where you stop the ass-eating?  Marissa's not getting any more ass-eating.  It's her birthday.  Happy birthday.  Like she wants the world to know she's 30 today.  What's wrong with you?  You're a great friend.  And then she goes, oh my god.  Everyone knows.  But no woman wants the world to know they're 30.  No, 30's not the cut off.  That's, that's silly.  I can make a joke and say that's the cut off. 
[01:20:30]  When do you stop, when do you stop beating a woman's ass?  What age?  Um.  55?  I think there's a gray area where.  Oh yeah.  Some would be bad.  It starts looking gray.  And some would be, yeah, it starts looking gray.  You're absolutely right.  There's, uh.  Would you eat that ass?  Whose ass is that on the screen?  Oh god, is that awful.  God, elephant ass.  No, because there are some girls that are in there, like, like fucking 20s that you look at.  All right, but in general, what's the cut off?  Cut off age.  I would say.  You go past 30. 
[01:21:00]  31.  It's five, give or take five years on 40.  Either way?  Take, give one.  You would eat a 40-year-old's ass?  It all depends.  Wow.  Some girls are very, very well.  Get the fuck out of here.  Put together, but, but, uh, that, um.  A 40-year-old?  Look, when the fuck am I going to be with a 40-year-old? 
[01:21:30]  No, but.  All right, I got to say what I want.  No, but I don't want you to just say what you want.  What are you thinking?  You would eat a 40-year-old ass if it looked good?  No, I'm like, uh, let me say, uh, I was just thinking overall, me, you're talking about  me personally?  Maybe, maybe seconds after a shower.  And I mean seconds.  35 tops.  Because within minutes it starts to, you know.  Yeah.  Because, you know.  35 unless they're extremely extenuating circumstances.  35.  Family held at gunpoint.  You have to eat the ass or they're dead. 
[01:22:00]  Would you eat Betty White's ass?  Ooh.  Woo.  I'm obsessed with her today.  Ooh.  Uh, hey, Big A, how are you?  All right, Opie, how are you doing?  You're not allowed to do any other radio shows, man.  The law came down today.  Yeah, yeah, man.  If Ira can't do our show, we can't spread our people around.  We've been spreading our people around for years.  I, I, we never gave a shit.  I, I, obviously I don't care what you do, Big A.  There's other people around here that are fucking twats about their stupid shows.  They got to relax. 
[01:22:30]  We, we're the kings of getting weirdos like yourself, Big A, and exploiting them.  We're the kings.  And now we take one from somebody else's show and now it's a big, it's a big issue.  How you been, brother?  All right.  Not bad.  Um, it's, uh, I've been a while, you know, you know, you have a, um, father.  Now, how's that going for you?  Oh my God, please don't ever smother my baby.  Wow. 
[01:23:00]  I didn't know what he was saying for a while.  I was like, oh.  He's congratulating me on the birth of my son, which is five months ago now.  Wow.  I mean, Jesus.  I know.  He started congratulating you five months ago.  Jesus.  Don't smother my baby, please.  Oh, God.  Have you ever smothered a baby?  By accident.  I know you wouldn't do it on purpose, but you got that, you know, that strength.  He's more a break of bunny rabbit's neck kind of guy anyway.  Twist it.  Yeah.  Right off its head.  I did not know.  Right off its head.  Does that make sense?  Probably not. 
[01:23:30]  Right off its body.  I don't know.  That's good.  Anthony's ass eating policy is like Logan's run.  Yeah.  Once you hit 30, your asshole starts beeping and turning red and you have to find sanctuary.  Big A, would you eat ass?  Um, I haven't been, ever.  You haven't eaten ass?  No, I haven't.  No?  No.  You were married to a what?  You were married to a what again?  Uh-huh.  Oh, you weren't married.  I'm Trinidadian. 
[01:24:00]  Trinidadian.  Do they call them Trinidadians or Trinidadian?  I don't know.  Someone from Trinidad.  A woman from Trinidad.  Right.  And you never had the desire to eat her ass.  That would be it.  Was she a black girl?  Well, she's from Trinidad, obviously, but I'm looking at girls here from Trinidad.  And they look all right.  And they, uh, they look like all the hot black girls, not the big, you know, fat, uh, Americanized,  um, uh, uh.  Jesus.  Well, no, I'm just saying, like, like. 
[01:24:30]  And you got scared because I said uppity earlier?  No, because there's a, there's an obesity problem.  There's an obesity problem.  The Americanized blacks are really bad is what Anthony's saying today.  There's an obesity problem within the black community among the women.  Not all?  I'm saying there's a problem.  I didn't say all.  All right.  But if you look now at Trinidad, all these women are very, uh, slender.  Was your girl slender?  Yes.  See?  Yes.  Look at these Trinidad women.  They're beautiful.  They are beautiful.  I got no problem with that.  How dark? 
[01:25:00]  As dark as your shirt you're wearing today?  Right?  Look at that.  Right?  Or as dark as your pants?  Let the record state that.  Oh, what about.  Wearing a brown shirt and black pants.  What about fat, Italian, hairy-faced women?  Yeah, they're disgusting, too.  What do you think?  I was going to go, hey, they're fucking hot.  Don't get on the fucking Italians.  Yeah, they're fucking disgusting, too.  That's what I'm saying.  What do you got?  How black was she?  She wasn't that black. 
[01:25:30]  She was, like, dark, but not black.  You know, like.  But give me a color.  Give us a, uh, uh, skin tone.  A color.  You got kind of a brown, not a dark brown shirt on.  You got a basic brown shirt on.  Oh, my God.  That would be very dark.  That would be very dark.  That's deceiving.  That would be very dark.  That would be dark.  Let's see.  He's pointing at a shirt.  How about, how about, ah, how about Cece?  Is she Cece Sabathia dark?  From the Yanks?  From the Yankees?  About that?  How about A-Rod? 
[01:26:00]  Too light, right?  Yeah, too light.  Too light?  Too light.  So she's kind of Cece?  Did she have a mustache like Cece?  She is from Trinidad.  Oh, Jesus.  Wow.  Was that a Trinidad woman?  Did she look like that?  Was she that dark?  Yeah, she looked like that.  She was that dark, that good looking, but.  Yeah.  Did she ditch your ass?  Is that what happened?  Oh, yeah.  He doesn't know. 
[01:26:30]  I think he's still married to her.  He just doesn't know.  Well, it doesn't matter in a shallow grave.  Why can't, oh, we got Ira on the phone.  Ira.  Hello, boys.  It's Substitute Ira.  Oh, it just makes us miss Ira.  I know.  I know.  I'd like to say, until we get him back, maybe each day somebody can call to fill us with  his joy, and maybe even. 
[01:27:00]  All right.  So, Big A.  So, you.  You don't like that guy's bid?  I think he's starting a good bid.  Every day we got an Ira calling.  Yeah?  Yeah.  The listeners will take that around with it now.  As long as they're better than him.  Why don't we jump right into Big A's news?  Because we got a busy show.  We got the, what the hell is that?  Are you going to be in the, what the hell is that bit?  You got some shit going on in your body?  Not really.  How's your health there?  Still alive.  That's good. 
[01:27:30]  That's a good sign.  I'm doing all right.  I'm doing all right.  Yeah.  Are you eating better?  Yes, I am.  We can tell.  You really mean it?  No, not at all.  You look like it.  I'm with Danny.  You might have gained a few pounds since the last time I saw you.  Oh, oh.  We're just worried about you, Big A.  Isn't Dr. Steve still, has he given up on you?  No, no.  He's still trying to help you out a little bit?  Yes.  Of course.  Yeah.  You ever get your bowels cleaned out? 
[01:28:00]  Yeah, didn't you have like fucking sacrete in there or something?  You have to go in with a jacket.  Like when Mythbusters went in the cement truck and had to fucking jackhammer the...  They got chipping it away.  Had to jackhammer the...  Oh, was that Dirty Jobs?  Which one was that?  Oh, God.  When they had to get the cement out of the cement mixer?  Oh, that was Mythbusters.  Mythbusters.  Mythbusters with the jackhammer.  Why don't we just put dynamite up your ass and fucking...  Yeah.  Big A, we worry about you.  That's all.  Yeah.  I know.  All right. 
[01:28:30]  You want to do the news with Big A?  Yay!  We got the news?  Because we're going to do some news with you,  and then we're going to move into...  What the hell is that?  The script requires a guest in here as well.  Oh?  However, he has very minimal role.  Usually it's Louis Twitchell Santani.  Yes.  Yes.  Is Bobo getting up?  Bobo's not doing this, is he?  Well, I mean, like I said, he's got a very, very minor role.  All right.  Bring Bobo.  All right.  He's not paying attention. 
[01:29:00]  Why would he?  Look at Bobo.  He's talking to the wall.  What a dolt.  Where is he?  That's all I'm personally going to pay attention to him is the wall.  Danny just called him exactly like you'd call a dog.  He goes, Bobo!  Bobo!  Why'd he run in like that?  I got my UFC hat on and my patented Opian Anthony show shirt.  Hi, Bobo.  How you doing, Bobo?  Hi, Ope.  Hi, Ant.  Hi.  How you doing?  You all right?  I'm doing good.  I'm just a little bit stuffed.  My nose is stuffed up. 
[01:29:30]  Oh, that's good.  Get everyone sick.  That's wonderful.  So, you psyched about the Mets in the playoffs?  Oh, that's right.  That's right.  Is Bobo, you're going to be part of this, what the hell is that?  Well, I do got something.  I do happen to have something.  I do got something.  Yeah.  What do you got?  It ain't grammar.  What do you got for this?  Or, or...  Belawn.  Besides the mangle, besides the mangle dick.  You got something else going on we're going to look at?  I don't want to say it yet. 
[01:30:00]  Don't fucking...  Shut up!  Shut up!  This is what he is the worst at, by the way, is keeping something secret or under wraps for  a while, because he always blurts it out.  No, no, I don't.  And then, bam, it comes out, of course.  Don't mention it, because you've got to wait for the bit.  Do you understand?  All right.  So shut up about that.  Don't even think about it.  All right.  Okay.  But you do have something.  Yeah, I do got something.  Yeah, I do got something. 
[01:30:30]  Yeah, I do got something.  You do.  How do people hate Bobo?  I know!  Because they're assholes, to be honest with you.  When it comes down to Bobo, it does good radio for us.  I get into Twitter wars with those people all the time.  Well, now, at least you won't have to tweet every two seconds that,  I want to be back on the show.  That was getting a little fucking monotonous there, Bobo.  Know what I mean?  Yeah, I know what you mean.  All right.  So you won't have to tweet that for a while.  What's the thing you got for the Dr. Steve part? 
[01:31:00]  I can't say it, remember?  No, just testing.  Oh, very good.  Just testing.  I saw what you were doing there.  You saw that?  Just testing.  We did that.  Just testing him.  Let's do the news with Big A and Bobo.  Yes.  Oh, good morning, and welcome to another...  ...rependous news segment. 
[01:31:30]  My name is Big A.  And I'm Bobo.  Oh, now he put it.  I hate him already.  I agree with the listeners now.  And I'm Bobo.  He kind of went off.  He's acting.  Shut up.  And I was part of the bit to act over at the top.  I was part of the bit.  I was part of the bit.  In a local...

[01:37:30]  Next week. 
[01:38:00]  Holy shit.  Oh, Big A, I heard some gossip about the situation.  The reason why he got kicked off.  Don't go off the script.  Wait, why are you going off the script?  Oh, I had a comment about the situation.  Well, it's a scripted piece here.  This is a fucking news.  Who asked you?  Oh, Big A!  Okay, sounds good, Big A.  Who the fuck asked you?  Oh!  Hardcore, Big A. 
[01:38:30]  Okay, I just thought...  It's just when I was looking at that story, I thought of a good line.  Oh!  Okay, sounds...  Okay, sounds good, Big A.  Okay, sounds good, Big A.  Bob, are you going to take that from Big A?  No, I was...  All it was good...  Hey, come on, there's something wrong with it.  I just thought I'd add a little bit to the bit when I saw...  I saw a good line there as I was looking at this, all right?  Wow.  I don't think it's wrong with that, all right?  By the way, he doesn't have his head.  The best part of this whole thing is...  You call him Big A. 
[01:39:00]  No!  Is Bobo's breathing.  Oh, I know.  Yeah, yeah.  That doesn't hurt.  Horrible.  All right, let's get back on script, boys.  Should we get the last line from Big A so we know where we are in the script?  Yeah.  Yeah, let's do that, Big A, because now we've got to get back on script here.  So just the last line in that last story, and then, Bobo, you pick up where you're  supposed to pick up.  All right, okay, sounds good.  No, that's not...  Even though that was a good response to what I just said, that's your actual line that  you have to wait to say after Big A does the last line of the last story. 
[01:39:30]  Go ahead, Big A.  It would be...  We'll see.  We'll see.  This is so fucked.  We'll see which stars hopes are us, us, us, us, us, us, us, us, us, I meet next week. 
[01:40:00]  Okay, sounds great, Big A.  Then he changes the line.  He changed the line again.  Why are you changing lines?  What does that line say?  Okay, sounds good.  All right, then why did you say... 
[01:40:30]  Why did you feel like you had to punch it up?  No, I just thought maybe I should add that a little bit to the line.  A little bit to the line.  Why would you think that?  It's a script.  You follow a script.  And then he just goes...  You're kind of bummed you don't have a lot of lines in this bit, huh, Bobo?  Is that the problem?  No.  You're like Lucy on every fucking...  Lucy...  I love Lucy episode.  I want to be in the show.  I want a bigger part. 
[01:41:00]  My dick is small and chewed up.  Bobo should be happy he's in here at all.  Oh!  Big A nailed him.  Holy shit.  Bobo's stupid.  Bobo looks so stupid.  You're like an asshole.  Ah, Bobo, you're not the man.  Like Big A.  Wow.  Bobo just went, hey.  Look, the little girly man needs his diapers changed.  Ah, diapers changed. 
[01:41:30]  No, I don't.  I might be stupid, but I don't wear diapers.  What?  That's a great comeback.  Terrific.  All right, Big A, last news story.  I want to time this one.  Um...  Um...  Um...  Um...  Finally...  Big...  Um...  Tech...  What are we today? 
[01:42:00]  Apple stockholders must be  Must be  Must be  Must be  Must be 
[01:42:30]  Holy shit, he is sweating  He goes wow  Like he is sweating profusely  You got this  Come on  We are rooting for you  Must be  Must be  Out 
[01:43:00]  As  As  As  As  As  As  As  As  I can't do this  Three lousy stories  As  As  ...stated that they would start talking iPads 
[01:43:30]  in their retail stores. 
[01:44:00]  In a move, I'm sure to steam some potential customers. 
[01:44:30]  Apple will strictly sell Wi-Fi-only iPads.  In order to take advantage of Ryzen's data service,  we need to purchase Ryzen's Wi-Fi, which converts Ryzen's 3D coverage 
[01:45:00]  into a wireless hotspot with an iPad, which is popular.  Love that wood.  With us... 
[01:45:30]  With us...  I...  College...  Students... 
[01:46:00]  I'm...  I'm...  I'm...  I'm...  I'm...  I'm...  Well, that's the news for today.  I'm Bobo.  And...  I'm...  I'm...  I'm... 
[01:46:30]  I'm...  I'm...  I'm...  I'm...  I'm...  I'm...  I'm...  I'm...  I'm...  I'm...  Why're budgets?  He's...  I'm...  I'm...  I'm...  I'm...  I'm...  I'm...  I'm...  I'm...  You know Big A.  We know who you are. 
[01:47:00]  My Big E's rebooting.  Shut up!  It doesn't say that.  Hold down.  Just get past his word.  And he'll be fine.  Maybe you start the sentence over again.  Yeah, better start over.  Start the sentence over again.  Let's go back to Bobo. 
[01:47:30]  Bobo, what did you say?  You set up Big A to make it easier for him.  No, I was just saying that Big E's rebooting.  No!  You're lying!  Read the script!  No wonder you're not on the show!  All right.  The part that I was going to say was,  well, that's the news for today.  All right, time for that.  Stick around with what the hell is that?  No!  Read the fucking line!  Holy shit!  Are you fucking stupid?  You cock!  Read the line, dummy!  Well, that's so close to believing. 
[01:48:00]  That's already the line that I already read.  But that's what we told you!  Read it again!  Well, that's the news for today.  I'm Bobo.  Well, not yet.  Wait until the Big A's ready.  Yeah, hold on.  Holy fuck.  Oh, my God.  I want to kill you.  And I hate that I have to say this.  I almost agree with the haters.  I know.  I'm completely agreeing with them.  I was making up for you, Bobo, when you got here.  Wow.  Wow.  You turned me.  Now, just say your line in 3, 2, 1.  Well, that's the news for today. 
[01:48:30]  I'm Bobo.  And I'm a Big A.  Us.  Us.  Us.  Us.  Do you know he had it right before we said it?  Yes.  Did you notice that?  Us.  He said stick right before.  I went, why don't you do it again?  Us.  Us.  Us. 
[01:49:00]  Us.  Tick.  Around what the hell is that?  Us.  I'm sorry if I.  If I.  If I.  If I.  If I.  Oh, yeah. 
[01:49:30]  Wow.  How long did that fucking take?  It was like...  It was like 10 minutes.  Wow, your face is beet red.  Yeah, you're all red.  You're sweating.  Could this lead to a medical issue?  Does anyone know?  We could ask Dr. Steve when he comes in,  because I think this is part of what the hell is that?  Yeah, look at his head.  It's like you ran a marathon.  Yeah.  And Big A, I mean, Bobo, 
[01:50:00]  you're breathing into the mic like a fucking rape victim.  Yeah, you're sitting there yelling...  Darth fucking Bobo.  He's done Darth Bobo.  Yes.  Bobo, why the heavy breathing?  No, it's just the breathing from my clogged up nose.  All right, dude, just tell me where the rebel's face is.  I need to know.  Oh, I want to test out the Death Star.  Oh, I shouldn't have told you that.  I want to know where the rebel base is just to say hi. 
[01:50:30]  Is that okay?  I'm going to blow up all the red.  But no, I'm not.  I'm going to blow up all the red.  I'm the fugitive.  I'm going to blow up not the dot.  Bobo.  Oh, God.  Oh, Bobo.  People are not happy out there, man. 
[01:51:00]  You stink.  One guy wants to...  Well, let me go to Kevin in New York.  Kevin, go ahead.  Good morning, boys.  Hey.  After you have Big A killed Bobo, can we just go home and take a nappy?  I'm exhausted.  I know.  I'm exhausted.  Unbelievable, right?  Yeah, maybe we end the show now.  It's so hard to...  All right, a lot of phone calls, but whatever.  It's so hard to listen to you trying to get that out, Big A.  I can't figure it out, but you have a problem with a certain word, I think.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  That just happens to come up every once in a while. 
[01:51:30]  Yeah.  Then there's words before the certain words.  Right.  Because he really had a problem with that.  When I saw...  Oh, stalagmites and stalactites.  Oh, my God.  Holy shit.  I knew we were in for a fucking...  And then when he said stalactities...  I said stalactites.  Stalactites.  And how did he say popular?  Poplar.  Poplar.  A wood. 
[01:52:00]  Hey, you do what you got to do, right there, Big A?  You eek through it.  Whatever.  God bless you.  God bless your barely beating heart.  You shit your pants and you move...  All right, Big A is going to be part of What the Hell is That?  So is Bobo.  We better maybe seg right into that.  We're running out of show.  Yeah, we should do that.  And maybe we'll do some other things as well.  Yeah.  Also, I want to play the Jesse Ventura thing one more time.  Ah, yes.  Speaking of the news and the mind...  Mind control. 
[01:52:30]  Check this out.  He sees the lies.  The gay elite, they're pushing their agenda on you and you don't even know it.  The secrets.  Pro-homo propaganda is being rammed down your throat.  The cover-ups.  They're using the media against us.  On the next conspiracy theory, Jesse Ventura exposes it all.  What's really going on with that Chilean mind?  Heartwarming story of survival or a two-and-a-half-month man-on-man love-a-thon constructed entirely by queer-controlled global media? 
[01:53:00]  It didn't have to be an expert watching that video to realize how hot those Chilean miners were.  All of them absolutely covered in sweat.  How aggressive they would like to drill, how much they would like to drill.  In some ways, those miners were having moments where they were enjoying each other's company.  Had to curve the shaft so it would pass through this new, what they call virgin rock.  Yeah, the gay elite want you prancing around like a bunch of sissies and sucking each other's cocks. 
[01:53:30]  If you can't measure, you can't manage it.  Remarkable pictures there on his knees.  You know, what goes in comes out.  That square hole, and it is dark, it is ominous.  It is almost a path to hell, and these men are coming up from that path.  You won't believe what you don't know.  I know why you're playing this one. 
[01:54:00]  We're, uh...  Anthony, we are one step closer to a Guns N' Roses reunion.  No way. 
[01:54:30]  Not with Axl.  Duff reunited with Axl and Guns N' Roses last night in London.  Yeah, well, you think Slash and Axl will ever share the stage again?  Duff was in that same category.  Nah, Duff is a lot different than the category of an Axl and a Slash getting together.  I don't know, man.  I don't think so.  You think Duff was the easy one, Travis?  Didn't Axl make fucking people...  We've had Duff on the show.  Axl said...  Hold on.  Okay, go ahead.  Did not Axl...  Did not Axl make people take off their big Slash hats at his concert? 
[01:55:00]  Oh, yeah.  Yes.  In Vegas a couple years ago?  Yay!  Axl said last year, one of them will die before they reunite.  I really don't think Slash...  Why is Duff joining them on stage?  And Slash will never do it.  Because if Duff does it, then maybe Slash does it.  No.  Axl said in the past, he said, I would do something with Duff.  But not Slash.  Never Slash.  They will never work together again.  That is a my brother and Jim Laird situation.  But your brother and Jim Laird aren't sitting in multi-million dollar fucking mansions. 
[01:55:30]  Like, I don't get that.  Everything's relative.  These guys are all ridiculous famous because they got together way back in time.  Made millions and millions of dollars together.  So how could you actually hate someone that much after all that?  Put it this way.  Slash is doing fine.  He enjoys playing music.  He enjoys what he's doing.  No, I get all that, but...  He doesn't have to put up with Axl's bullshit anymore.  But the hate to continue.  You know, people grow apart and all that.  I get that.  But, I mean, they're in a position today because of what they did together. 
[01:56:00]  But I think there's more...  27-odd years ago.  I think there's more hatred on Axl's part for Slash than there is for Slash on Axl.  And I think Slash is at the point in his life where he's like, he just doesn't need the bullshit.  Yeah, Slash, I mean, he's been in here.  He's doing fine.  He's one of the most easy-going guys in the world.  You think he needs to put up with fucking Axl's baby shit?  Yeah, all right.  And a couple years ago with his biography, I think Axl got pissed.  Well, I still think they were a step closer because Duff was on that stage.  I would hope so.  Izzy's played with him.  Maybe there's a few more big, huge steps that have to take place, but... 
[01:56:30]  The money's right.  I'd suck another dick if that happens.  Whoa, you said another.  That's the joke!  Whoa, whoa, whoa.  That's the joke, baby!  Whoa, whoa.  Wow.  Dr. Steve's in studio, and Dr. Mike.  I haven't seen Dr. Mike in a while.  How are you, sir?  Good, thank you, thank you.  How have you been?  How's the practice going?  Oh, fantastic.  Yes?  You'd think you'd have it down by now.  Oh, no, it's a doctor joke. 
[01:57:00]  The practice thing.  Yes!  That whole practice thing is so funny with you doctors.  And what was your field of expertise, if you could refresh the memory of people?  Internal medicine and hospice and palliative care.  No, I care!  Just look at these weirdos and, you know, tell us what they got.  Internal medicine.  Internal medicine.  And what?  Hospice and palliative care.  Oh, okay.  You're a hospice guy.  Yep.  Oh, so you've seen a lot of them check out, huh?  Yeah, all of them.  All of them. 
[01:57:30]  That's the purpose.  Holy shit!  That's the purpose of hospice, Anthony.  Now, Dr. Steve, you do that too, don't you?  Yeah, it's a bizarre coincidence.  There's 2,500 board-certified hospice and palliative medicine providers in this country,  and there's two of them right here.  Speaking of board, I'm kidding!  It's another joke!  I'm full of them.  I probably...  Enough about that, Anthony.  I've got to ask Dr. Steve something.  I probably should have asked him off-air, but my private life is my private life, but 
[01:58:00]  let it be known that Dr. Steve and his lovely...  Simple list.  Well, we clear that one up.  Dr. Steve and his lovely wife came over for a little dinner last night.  Oh!  And we shared a couple bottles of wine.  Yes, we did.  Wine.  And we did a little New York City takeout.  Yes, we did.  It was an awful rainy day, and my son was crawling around all over the place.  Look at you having a moment like a romantic comedy.  Manhattan.  Yeah.  Take out some wine.  Yeah, you're right.  Overlooking the river.  Put some Frank Sinatra on. 
[01:58:30]  Yes.  And we had a great night, and then I brought you to the elevator, and we said the goodbye  hugs and stuff.  And you kicked him down an open shaft.  Well, no.  No?  It's better than any joke you can come up with, to be honest with you.  And then he hugs my wife and says, I love you.  Do you remember doing this?  Yeah, vaguely.  I think I hugged you and said, I love you, too.  At least it was your wife, yeah.  So then...  I was just having a moment. 
[01:59:00]  That's what I told her.  Yeah.  She wasn't sure if you...  Why?  Did she get in the fetal position at the bottom of the shower?  She was laughing.  She was laughing her ass off as soon as the door closed.  And she goes, did you...  I go, yeah.  I go, but I think he was just, like, having a moment.  Yeah.  And then she goes, I think he might have, like, you know, when you say something stupid,  you're like, oh, my God, why did I just say that?  So I had to ask you on the air what that was about.  Do you actually love my wife?  Well, we love you guys.  You love my wife?  You love my wife? 
[01:59:30]  You fuck my wife?  But why did you put you in that, too, Dr. Steve?  Why did you say me, too?  And then I felt bad and say I love you to your wife, and it gets all complicated.  Aw, now it's awkward.  Oh, you shan't be back.  You blew it!  I want you to do the Pope of Greenwich Village.  Yeah, I know.  If you're going to start with that one, I want you to go, they took my thumb?  That broad robbed you?  That broad robbed you?  That broad robbed you?  That broad, they took my thumb?  We got Vic Henley back in the studio, by the way. 
[02:00:00]  That's the one that's going to sound the most Southern out of all the Southern people  that we have in the studio.  A couple of Southern people.  I'm the real Opie.  How many bottles of wine did you guys go through?  Two.  Two?  And what were you drinking before you got there?  Nothing, but the food took a while to get there, and so we were drinking on empty stomach.  Oh, empty stomach drinking.  Was it your wine, by the way?  One of the bottles was not homemade wine.  Okay.  Speaking of that, by the way, can I say this? 
[02:00:30]  Let me grab this.  Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.  I want to talk about the wine.  I got a couple things.  Let me control this for a second.  Hold on, hold on, hold on, Ann.  Hold on.  So the whole I love you was just like a moment.  He was caught up.  It was a nice moment, because we had a nice night.  Yeah, I was having a moment.  And as far as the wine goes, Ann, he brought over a bottle of wine.  That's what you do when you visit.  I looked at it, and I went, all right, this will be the second bottle of wine.  Oh.  And then I broke out some of the fines.  Ah, connoisseur.  Connoisseur. 
[02:01:00]  And then we went with his bottle, because then it doesn't matter as much.  Yes, my bottles are in the office, and that's what Dr. Stephen is going to get on me about.  Absolutely.  I remember.  Where was my bottle of wine?  What bottle?  Proudly displayed on my desk in my home.  Yes.  As much as I make fun of Dr. Stephen and his awful wine, it is displayed nicely.  I said, put mine in the office till I leave.  And these incompetents never give them to me.  We don't even know where our office is.  Two bottles of Anthony's Luscious Hog.  Luscious Hog.  And I remember hearing the words, I'm going to immediately put this in my collection, Dr. Stephen. 
[02:01:30]  By immediately, I meant a month.  Yeah, and the collection that's on top of E-Rock's desk.  All right, give me the goddamn bottles right now.  They're going in my bag.  And it's a good conversation piece.  It really is.  Put that in behind the bar.  Now at least I have it.  Yeah, there you go.  Well, I can't put both.  That was my brother's excuse for everything.  It's a good conversation piece.  Yeah, I put it up here.  There we go.  By the way, your wine was in a box, and I just made sure it was on display when you came to my bag. 
[02:02:00]  Now it'll probably be displayed in my backpack for the next month or two.  He's going to put it right next to one of his 38 Bud Light dispensers that he has in his house.  That's right, my Bud Light kegs and my Guinness kegs.  I think Vic Henley was impressed by that yesterday.  You walked away gone, God, that's pretty good.  Exactly, exactly.  The more taps you have, that's better than more tea.  He's got the Guinness and the Bud Light taps at his house.  I feel like shit, though, because Dr. Steve, every time he comes up to New York, I'm going out somewhere.  I'm leaving.  And I have not been over to the compound for the drinks. 
[02:02:30]  I would like to hug you and tell you I love you when you leave.  I think that would be fun.  She was laughing.  She goes, did you hear that?  I'm like, yeah, I heard that.  Well, she's lovely.  I mean, she's just a great person.  But it wasn't a general, I love you guys.  I love, thanks for having me.  It was an eye on, focus, focus.  I love you.  I love you.  It'd be weird doctor thing.  I love you.  I gave his wife an air kiss.  It wasn't even right.  I did an air kiss, and he's like full-on hug with an I love you. 
[02:03:00]  I love you.  I love you.  And then we had a discussion if Dr. Steve and his wife were swingers.  Oh, no.  And I was like, is that his move?  Oh, no.  Was I supposed to move it?  His move.  I love you.  Was I supposed to move it?  He just goes in deep.  He goes in deep with the I love you.  There's no pussyfooting around.  Oh, no.  I'm a swinger.  I love you.  I love you.  Oh, it's funny.  We had an awesome night.  Yeah, it was great. 
[02:03:30]  I can't make too much of it.  We had a lot of fun.  I'm glad you came over and checked out the whole scene.  Yeah.  Now, your compound is not nearly the size of his.  Are you more subdued?  Well, he's in the city.  I'm in the city, so I'm out in suburbia.  I'm way up in the clouds.  All right.  That's okay.  We had to make decisions in life, like convenient to get into work really quick, or move way out  east on Long Island, have a palace, but then the commute kills you.  That's the eternal battle.  I kind of compromised.  I went with, like, kind of just into suburbia. 
[02:04:00]  You went with space.  To get some room and, you know.  Now, that's the New York thing.  It all boils down to space.  They can't hear.  The neighbors can't hear the screams.  Right.  It is what I needed.  An apartment doesn't work for me.  I smell something dead.  I may have to chop up the body and put it in the garbage sheet.  Why is there so much lime being brought up in the freight elevator?  I don't need these kind of things.  Now, getting back to our night, Dr.  Our night.  I'm telling you.  I love you.  Sounds like I was just, like, you know. 
[02:04:30]  You were the cock blocker.  Oh, shit.  Focused.  He was focused.  Yes.  Fuck.  I didn't realize you didn't know I was there.  Your wife is lovely.  It's what it is.  Of course she is.  You know, she's a very sweet and nice girl.  But I want to ask Dr. Steve, I don't know, I don't want to, like, cross the line here.  I'm going to write something down.  Oh, shit.  You know some of the stories you were telling last night?  You've never told them on the story.  Oh, no.  Oh, no.  I don't know what you're talking about.  Oh, when you were selling cadaver parts or so.  Hold on.  This one. 
[02:05:00]  Because I don't know.  No, because we are friends in the end, and I don't want to step over too many lines here.  Oh, yeah.  Now, that's one.  And I've been just sort of saving that nuclear bomb for some time.  For this show.  Jesus.  It's time.  Really?  You think so?  If you're going to talk about it, talk about it on our show.  Okay.  You can do the medical shit with Ronnie all you want.  Give us that story.  Jesus.  He reveals something to you.  A weird medicine is happening.  Of nuclear capacity.  Tonight at midnight?  No, Saturday. 
[02:05:30]  Oh, Saturday.  Saturday at 7.  Sorry.  Saturday at 7.  Not even close.  Who's on at midnight?  Big Kev.  Tonight?  No.  Saturday.  Saturday, Big Kev's.  What?  This show is on at midnight.  This show will be on at midnight.  Whose channel is this?  I have no idea.  Oh, it's our channel.  No, when are you on?  Saturday, 7 to 9 p.m.  And Ronnie's doing the show with you.  Yes.  I was trying to give you a plug.  I just fucked it all up.  Yeah, that's going to be a great show.  Dr. Steve and Ronnie.  Tomorrow night at 7.  You want to talk about it real fast before we get into what the hell is that? 
[02:06:00]  Yeah, that isn't one of those stories you can tell real fast.  I just, you know, I met somebody on the internet several years ago and I married her after 72 days.  Oh, wow.  There you go.  Always a good formula.  Well, we only had five days of face-to-face.  Oh, God, even worse.  Even worse.  Yeah.  And it didn't go well.  Good judgment.  Do you pick the green square on the roulette wheel, too? 
[02:06:30]  Are you the one guy that bets that?  Are you that bull?  Double zero.  Come on, baby.  I can't let you fucking roll.  Hey, it pans off at the worst.  Oh, absolutely.  So does 11 on the dice game, but, you know.  Wow.  Did you know he wrote a book?  What?  That he promoted on Phil Donahue.  Really?  This Dr. Steve has done some shit with his life.  I know.  You know, you can tell by talking to him.  He's very wise. 
[02:07:00]  And yet not, if he married a woman after 72 days.  That's how you get wise.  But that led to the book, right?  Yeah, I've read the book.  You read the book?  Yeah, it's great.  Wait, hold on, hold on.  You're a magnificent bastard.  Hold on, hold on.  Dr. Steve, did you write the book after meeting this girl?  After meeting her, but not before I could...  Oh, Jesus.  Oh, wow.  I have never seen Dr. Steve like that.  Have you seen his book on Amazon?  I like to see smart people confused.  I love to see smart people confused.  No, don't talk about the book on Amazon.  Why?  Well, because it has my last name on it. 
[02:07:30]  And then, you know, my...  Here's part of my problem.  Oh, my God.  You can't just say what you said there.  I know.  I know.  I know I'm a fucking idiot, obviously.  Oh, God damn, no, no.  Don't get yourself in a jam-up.  Yeah, we don't want you to get in a jam-up.  Where'd you go to medical school?  Where'd you go to medical school?  University of North Carolina.  Okay, I just wanted to hear that, and then I'm a fucking idiot.  Okay, all right.  Sorry.  Put it together.  Sorry, okay.  My issue is the minute that it's known, you know, that I lose my anonymity, 
[02:08:00]  my ability to drop F-bombs on national radio disappears.  So, you know, I've always been real careful about that.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Let's just say it didn't go well, and can we just leave it at that?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  I'm sorry.  We should.  I'm still a newbie at this stuff, and so I should have just said, no, we can't talk.  All right, all right.  Fair enough.  Fair enough.  I'll hear the story at some point. 
[02:08:30]  It's got to be on the radio, though.  Really?  Yeah.  Maybe Big A.  We could tell it through Big A and say somebody...  I don't know.  All right, that's fine.  Is it hot in here?  Yeah, it's very hot.  Yeah, yeah, it's really...  It's an amazing story, though.  I wouldn't doubt it.  That's all I'll say.  All right, that's fair enough.  I didn't go too far.  No, no, no, no, no.  And I learned my lesson when you hold up something if I can't talk about it.  Well, I asked you.  We already cast one movie today.  We already cast one movie today, mine.  True.  And we've got to get that done before we get to Dr. Steve's. 
[02:09:00]  All right.  Well, we're going to do What the Hell is That?  I know that.  Yes.  What the hell is that?  We haven't done this in quite a while.  We have two doctors here, and we have some, I guess, listeners outside.  How many guys we got today?  Are they creepy?  Five.  Five of our listeners.  And they have various afflictions.  Yeah.  Five out of the hundreds that we, you know, sifted through to call out the listeners. 
[02:09:30]  Oh, yeah, yeah, to call.  And two of the five are Big A and Boga.  Oh, okay.  So another bit that's fucking up.  It's going to be a disaster.  Yeah, I can really pull them in.  No, it's, believe me.  Why do you think I want me to tell that other story to save our asses?  No.  If it goes bad, I'm maybe a little bit.  He held up a sign that said ex-wife, so it really is a billboard for, you know, happiness.  You at least got to read the part where he's meeting her for the first time. 
[02:10:00]  Oh, Jesus.  Oh, my God.  See, he's on.  Right, everybody knows.  Jesus, Sam.  Everybody knows.  Yeah, right.  It's so funny.  It's so funny.  It's funny.  Wait, can we talk about this separately, then?  Can we talk about the ex-wife at all, or no?  Yeah, yeah.  Okay.  What?  Yeah, he said as long as there's no names or locations.  Yeah.  So, like, in the, because in the inscription that he wrote, he sent it to me, wait, like,  two years ago.  Yeah, see, that's the problem, Doc, Steve.  We had no idea you wrote a book until you sent it to us.  I know.  That was your first mistake. 
[02:10:30]  I know.  Well, things change.  All right, all right.  I'm trying to be better.  He explained where it was.  But in the book, like, in the middle of the book, he talks about meeting her in person  for the first time, and the plane touching down, and even though he had never seen her  face-to-face that their souls were already joined, he was sitting on the plane, he was  writing a letter to her, realizing that their souls were already won. 
[02:11:00]  And even though you said that really kind thing, you also heard at the exact same time, his  disgust in believing in love.  It was like the hope and the disgust at the same time.  It was the total combo package of love.  Fantastic clinical decision-making.  The other doctor busted on him.  Dr. Heckling.  Dr. Heckling going on in the room.  Calling Dr. Heckling.  The inscription basically says, everything this book says, don't do it. 
[02:11:30]  Oh, it's turned into a one not to do it.  Oh, wait, but he wrote that recently.  Yeah.  That was to you?  He just wrote it in the book.  Yeah, he had another extra one laying around.  Can we talk about your ex-wife, Dr. Steve?  Peer-to-peer.  No one else is listening.  I think, well...  Don't force Dr. Steve to do anything.  That's why I asked.  I know.  That's a question.  But you've asked five times.  Now you're needling him.  I know it would be fantastic radio, but you don't want to do that at the cost of destroying  a friend's life. 
[02:12:00]  Let him think it over.  Do you remember...  You must remember who runs this channel here, too, by the way.  So, just think of it.  Howard?  Probably.  Probably.  It's up to you, Dr. Steve.  Does your divorce decree forbid you from saying disparaging things?  Yes, but the good thing is, I have this radio show, which is a freedom of  speech outlet and my income and things.  So, there are certain gray areas that I'm able to get along with.  I can't disparage or I can't slander, libel, things like that. 
[02:12:30]  But I can talk about what happened in my life.  You can talk about the truth.  The fact that there was a night that I went out, I was playing a gig, she and her mother  got so hammered drunk I had to drive them home, big fight, ran out of gas with the fucking  truck that was supposed to load the equipment up.  My whole band is waiting at the gig with all the equipment outside in the snow now because  the club was like, get the fuck out, we're closing, while I'm out of gas on the side 
[02:13:00]  of the road with the two drunkards on the side of the road.  It was horrible.  My brother thought I was dead.  The whole band thought I was dead.  They're like, no way Anthony would ever do this.  It's not like him.  But yeah, I could tell stories like that.  How my ex-mother-in-law got hammered and walked into a keg party in the apartment next to hers  because she thought it was her apartment and just fell asleep on the couch at a college  keg.  Nice.  Nice.  I know.  There you go.  You used to call that free meat. 
[02:13:30]  Call Foxworthy.  That's who you might be a redneck right there.  That's who you might be a redneck.  I can tell stories about what had happened, but I can't then go on and say things that aren't  accurate or disparaging things that aren't true or my opinions of what...  I see what you're doing.  Yeah.  Your turn, Dr. Steve.  No, no, I wasn't.  Dr. Steve asked me a question.  You're brilliant.  He was baiting the field.  You're brilliant.  He was baiting the field.  He just does it differently than me.  He's putting down some side legs.  Anthony shared, not Dr. Steve shares. 
[02:14:00]  This is a fucking brilliant, Anthony.  This is a typical tactic I see on First 48 every time I watch it.  It's fucking brilliant.  It's called good cop, bad cop.  No.  No, I would not want Dr. Steve to do anything that gets him in any kind of trouble.  What can you say that you want to say?  That you're dying to say?  It just didn't go well.  Ballpark, are we talking within five years, within 10 years, within 15 years ago?  Well, ago? 
[02:14:30]  15 years ago.  Okay.  Oh, wow.  Okay.  Oh, my God.  This is...  Any contact whatsoever with this person since?  Very, very little.  Very little.  Very little.  Yeah.  For a reason?  For a reason?  A legal reason that you need contact?  Or just a casual something happened?  Well, there were, you know...  She had kids, and I helped to raise them.  Oh, okay.  All right.  See, right.  Okay.  So they recognized he was a...  I wasn't even going to get in that.  They recognized he was a good guy, and actually, every four years, she had to explain what happened 
[02:15:00]  to Dr. Steve.  Where's the good guy?  Where's the guy that, you know...  I love that Easter basket that year.  Oh, he's holding up another fucking note.  He's got another right.  Oh, my God.  Talk about when you were a second story man for the fucking Brinks robbery, guys.  Remember when your alcoholic father raped you in your sleep.  Please, come on.  Give it up.  Talk about that, Dr. Steve.  Give it up.  Let me hold up a note.  Serial killer rapist.  Candy corn in the anus.  Right.  See, this is my problem, though.  You come over to my house, you tell a story to three people.  I'm the same way. 
[02:15:30]  I would be exactly like this.  You're telling a story to a million people.  I would be exactly like that.  It's killing me what I heard last night.  You're on a tape recorder and play it on the air.  Like any sneak would.  Like Indy Linda Tripp.  Like any self-respecting Linda Tripp.  Linda Tripp, your pal over here.  All right, we're going to...  I tried.  Dr. Steve's rolling his sleeves.  He's like, oh, I'm harsh.  Dr. Steve's like, oh, I'd rather stick fingers in guys' asses at this point.  Bring on Proctober.  Yes, Proctober.  Proctober, you want your prostate checked? 
[02:16:00]  I had just recently.  How'd you do?  I'm good.  Oh, absolutely.  Nice.  I didn't mean to give you a thumbs up.  I felt it.  I felt it.  You want a second opinion?  No, I'm good.  I'm actually all good.  Third opinion, we got two guys here.  No, you're all right?  Okay.  You keep going back for second, third, fourth opinions.  Never been better.  Don't want to reenact that scene from Fletch.  So where are we at?  River.  Why don't we do the, what the hell is that then?  Yeah, why don't we do that?  We'll let Dr. Steve off the hook for now.  Praise the Lord.  For now.  Yeah, that's, uh...  For now. 
[02:16:30]  I bet you if we get the wine flowing in here, he'll start yapping.  I'm sorry, Obi.  He's dying.  Poor Dr. Steve.  He's dying.  I just like him holding up the pieces of paper.  I know.  How about this?  Okay, how about this?  No, I really don't want to do that.  How about this one?  No, how about this then?  No, I really don't want to do this at all.  Okay, how about dog sled team?  It just ended badly.  Everything.  Can I write another one down for just these guys?  Sure, sure.  Just for these guys. 
[02:17:00]  I won't say anything.  So you got that one.  Right.  You got the other one, right?  Yeah.  Okay.  This one is going to make you want it.  This is like, whose line is it anyway?  Don't say what this is.  No, no, no, never.  Oh, wow.  Yeah.  That's a combo platter of jokes right there.  Now you understand where I'm at.  I'm totally with you.  Now you understand where I'm at.  Was that crazy long-haired, Dr. Steve?  Yes. 
[02:17:30]  Just wondering.  Just wondering.  Now you know where I'm at, certainly.  Curly perm, Dr. Steve.  Curly hair perm.  Jesus.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Hey, come on.  You let a fine life up until now, and you're still doing strong.  It's great.  Can I write another one down?  Oh, my gosh.  Sure, man.  This is the greatest game ever.  This is the greatest game.  We should have listeners call in and guess what words he's writing down on his face.  Duct tape, garbage dumpster, and small child. 
[02:18:00]  I swear, when you wrote that first line, I thought the next thing was going to be high school.  The second one was the one that threw me.  All these stories after two bottles of wine, you can't hang in the compound.  No, absolutely not.  Oh!  Oh, wow.  Ooh.  Oh, always.  Right.  Once you throw money into it.  Wow.  That's amazing.  Can I, can I, uh, one more?  Holy shit.  Dr. Steve is now in what we call the protective stance. 
[02:18:30]  He's got his arms crossed in front of him.  Uh.  Let's see.  Uh, uh, uh, uh.  Rarely do you get a chance to make the doctor nervous.  Regular people often don't get a chance to make the doctor nervous.  This is really good.  Oh, Dr. Steve.  I'm sure the audience loves.  Oh, yeah, they go.  Dr. Steve.  Oh, wow.  Oh, man.  Yes!  Oh, man.  Wow.  Oh, wow.  That's cruel.  Is that true?  That's just cruel. 
[02:19:00]  Don't worry, listeners.  Once he's dead, we'll tell you.  That's right.  He'll be on his tombstone.  Oh, my God.  This is all, like, this isn't even, like, like, oh, my goodness.  This is life.  Yeah, it's regular stuff.  It's fucking life shit.  Oh, really?  All right.  Yeah.  Hold on.  He's going to add to it.  Okay.  I can fix that.  Okay.  I can fix that.  Maybe I'll say, oh, except that.  That's what he said.  Wow.  You were a chatty Cathy last night, Dr. Steve, weren't you?  I had a little bit of wine.  I'm going to end it with an I love you to my wife. 
[02:19:30]  I love you.  Goddamn.  What's that?  Oh, God.  Even that, too.  That's above and beyond the call of duty.  That is true.  My writing bed?  That's above and beyond the call of duty.  You got it?  Yeah.  Oh, you're just in shock?  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah.  Wow.  Yeah.  All right.  First time I'm on, Jimmy quits smoking.  This time, Steve quits drinking.  Yeah, yeah.  That's great.  Oh, boy.  Did I learn a valuable lesson today?  I've never had the yellowtail sodium pentothal, it sounds delicious, though. 
[02:20:00]  I'm going to have to grab a bottle.  Let me say this, so it's not a waste of time.  Yeah.  Will this come out someday on our show?  Yeah.  Yeah, absolutely.  If it comes out anywhere, it'll come out on this show.  All right.  Fair enough.  Yes, absolutely.  Much like the boils and other pustules.  There's a vindictiveness there that I'm concerned about.  With Opie, right?  No.  Sorry.  I thought...  Eh, shit. 
[02:20:30]  Why don't we bring in one of our, um...  Fucking...  Please.  Wait, wait.  Please.  Oh, and then Opie goes, wait, wait.  And Max, please.  No, no, no, no, no.  This is like when...  Wait, hold on.  This is exactly like when terrorists go, you go home today.  You go home today.  And they give you your clothes and drive you around the block.  And then you're back in the prison.  What happened?  We keep going.  And we're going to fucking go to the bit.  And Opie goes, wait, wait.  One second.  Can I talk about the... 
[02:21:00]  Yeah.  Columbo, go ahead.  Can I talk about the snakes?  Snakes?  Reptiles?  There's reptiles in this story, too?  Snakes?  I don't know what you're talking about.  All right.  Here he goes again.  I don't know the hell of a bottle of wine.  Come on.  One more thing, Dr. Steve, before I go.  Oh, really?  Snake handling?  Oh, wow.  Now you're getting into my territory here with the snake handling.  With that.  You know, come on.  No, we're in...  Yeah, we're in an area where there's... 
[02:21:30]  Yeah, there's plenty of that.  You went to medical school in North Carolina.  Yeah, that's right.  So there is some snake handling going on.  Snake handling in North Carolina?  Anywhere there are idiots, there's snake handling.  The handling's like, he's finally got a subject I can talk about.  Come on.  I've had people be prejudiced about the other snake.  Come on, it's rattlesnakes and cyanide.  It's not copperheads and strychnine, goddammit.  What kind of freaks are you involved in?  It's rattlesnakes and cyanide.  Read the Bible, for God's sake.  You ever go to one of those churches?  I've been to one, but not when they were. 
[02:22:00]  I would go just to check it out.  I wouldn't touch the fucking snakes.  I would want to see those under a tent.  They fucking have a big tent.  And some of them will be in a church.  Wow, a real life church.  Some in a re-renovated home or something like that.  They're very private about it.  And it's one of those things that they feel that's a gift of the spirit,  is to be able to handle snakes and survive it.  How many people get bitten and die? 
[02:22:30]  I hope a lot.  I hope every year.  Every year, this thins the herd.  This thins the herd every year.  You know we're playing What the Hell is That today?  Well, Brian wants to tell the world what Dr. Steve has.  Brian, go ahead.  I think Dr. Steve has a bad case of putting us from his mouth.  Lubricated by Merlot.  But when I hear such great stories, it kills me that I can't run on the air immediately. 
[02:23:00]  That's how I wanted to start the show today.  I'm like, I can't do it to Dr. Steve.  I've got to wait for him to get here and see what he's willing to talk about.  I'm exactly the same way.  And you're not willing to talk about it.  And in the end, that is completely fine with me, because you're my friend.  If you weren't my friend, you'd be so fucked right now.  I know.  I can't even tell you.  That would be like telling some...  You know what it is, though?  I'll put it in perspective.  Let me put it in perspective here for a minute.  A couple of AAF stories.  You might want to keep a couple under the hat.  I'll trade some AAF stories to get that shit out. 
[02:23:30]  No problem.  Trading stories.  Abercrombie and Fitch.  I'll trade some AAF stories.  That's how good this shit is.  I'm the same way as you.  I'd be the worst diplomat ever.  It kills me.  People tell me things, and then the next most inappropriate situation...  That's like that time that you put on the leather hood and decided that racism was a good idea.  Hey, I never talked to you.  That's true.  I didn't recognize you.  You did have the hood on.  I didn't know it was you.  All right.  Well, the truth of it is, when I told you that, I didn't even think about putting you in the position where I'd given you good material for this show. 
[02:24:00]  Please, anything.  Anything.  Of course.  Right.  You didn't recognize you were talking to the writer?  Don't put me in your book.  How long have you been listening to this program?  I know.  I know.  I hope he is like, if you tell the story, he is going to want it on the air.  Oh, my God.  Of course.  Yeah.  It's all good.  All right.  Let's do What the Hell is That?  Yes.  What the Hell is That?  Oh.  Wait.  No, of course.  Wait.  Did he just make the universal sign of whoof? 
[02:24:30]  It was the whoosh.  And I just skated?  The whoosh.  Hang on.  No, no, no, no.  It wasn't skating.  It was just wiping off the flop sweat.  Skating.  Put my pen down?  Absolutely.  You're all right.  Yeah.  All right.  Drop the pen.  Drop it.  Fair enough, sir.  All right.  Let's bring in one of our diseased messes that are going to be diagnosed.  You know, and of course, these are doctors, but this is not an official diet.  Do you have a disclaimer or something that you'd like to say? 
[02:25:00]  Even though I am a doctor, I am not your doctor.  Ah, very good.  Oh, yeah.  Very good.  Yeah, we could have this guy.  We'll shift over.  Hey, Yankees!  You watching the game tonight?  Who gives a shit?  Hey, are we filming this shit?  Someone's got to film today.  I don't feel like picking up my camera today.  Hey, sir.  What's up, man?  Hello, sirs.  Hi.  A little closer to that microphone there.  You dig right in.  Oh, no.  Don't apologize.  It's okay.  You're a Yankee fan.  What's your story there?  What's your name?  My name's Paul, a.k.a. Puddle of Aids.  Oh, you're Puddle of Aids.  You're fucking Puddle of Aids. 
[02:25:30]  I'm the Puddle of Aids.  I'm not meeting a star.  It's famous guy.  He's a famous guy.  I'm meeting a star.  You thought only schleps were coming today.  Huh?  You thought only schleps were coming today.  Look at this.  And you were on what?  Tell the people.  TedWilliamsHead.com.  Which is a great fucking sports blog site.  I appreciate all the plugs.  That's an amazing, fun name that I love.  I love Ted Williams Head.  Who doesn't love detached heads in sports?  I know.  And Frozen.  Obviously a fan of the show, but also a big-time sports fan.  I do.  Honestly, his blog is really good. 
[02:26:00]  Yeah.  It really is good.  I go there a lot.  Recently you had the Brett Favre getting a football to the nuts shot.  Anything happen in sports, he's talking about and putting up on that site.  Quickly then, your take on tonight's game and the rest of the series there.  I think the Yankees are going to win, but I'm a little, I don't want to get too detailed,  but I think Girardi made a mistake with the rotation.  Ah, were you going to stick with the three-man?  I would have went Burnett against Cliff Lee.  Oh, you just would have switched around a little bit against Lee.  Just so he would have shits the bed anyway. 
[02:26:30]  Right, because he doesn't matter against Cliff Lee.  Just give the game up.  Yeah, doesn't matter.  Yeah, yeah.  So I just put CeCe and then...  People are very nervous about him.  Well, Cliff Lee is an animal.  Yeah, I know.  Hey, y'all have the bad days.  Hopefully he has his bad day.  Just be bold.  You can't be arrogant, obnoxious, everybody hates your Yankee fan, and all of a sudden puss out  and win the playoffs.  Just drop the hammer and commit.  Yeah, exactly.  Stick with it.  We're going to sweep them.  We swept Minnesota.  We're crushing your hopes and dreams.  Exactly.  We spent $188 million.  If it's a grade, it's a success. 
[02:27:00]  It's what we paid for.  If not, it's glitter on a turd.  There it is.  So either way, what are you going to do?  I like the way you think.  Yeah, don't wuss out.  You can't fucking...  Are you a baseball fan?  I'm a sad Braves fan who apparently thought it was the hacky sack playoffs and decided  to kick the ball around the fucking three games they played with the San Francisco Giants.  But yes, I am a Braves fan.  I'm a baseball fan and a Braves fan.  Nice.  Nice.  All right.  Look at that.  Okay.  Now, you are here not to talk sports, my friends.  And, of course, Puddle of AIDS.  I hope that doesn't worry the doctors.  I don't really see...  Well, I noticed they moved away from Puddle of AIDS. 
[02:27:30]  I, too, would move away from Puddle of AIDS.  It is just an internet name.  No medical gloves?  No.  Uh-oh.  What is he?  Oh, they do have medical gloves.  Puddle of AIDS.  Wow, he's asking the doctors to put on medical gloves.  He's putting them on.  This is the first for our show.  Because he looked and read what you wrote through the window.  It's not for his safety.  It's not for the doctor's safety.  It's the first patient warning I've ever received.  Glove on it.  Dr. Steve, you can tell me twice. 
[02:28:00]  Dr. Mike's a little nervous, too.  Oh, shit.  All right.  All right.  Well, let's not draw this out any longer than it need be.  What seems to be your problem, Puddle of AIDS?  I have a hole.  In a bucket.  Dear Liza.  Dear...  Shut it.  Really?  Just shoot me.  What'd you get, a hole?  I have a hole.  Hold on.  Something Dr. Steve told me last night.  But a hole.  All right.  A hole.  This is very, very...  Inches above my asshole.  Oh. 
[02:28:30]  Holy shit.  But wait.  There's more.  It oozes blood.  Oh, wow.  Holy shit.  Oh, God.  Wait.  Why did we start with him?  He sounds like...  He's the headliner.  Say this with a closer.  Yeah, this is the closer for sure.  He might be the headliner.  He just blew a lood.  You never start with the headliner.  Wow.  Come out and do stairway.  Haven't you got to wait three hours for?  What does the next guy have?  Holy shit.  Are you kidding?  We'll tell you what it is sight unseen.  Yeah, I'm sure they know. 
[02:29:00]  You guys ain't going to be happy.  And I cleaned up nice last night, but I was a little late, so I sprinted down to Avenue  America's, so it's a lot of flop sweat and just...  Wait, how long have you had this?  Probably two years, three years.  Two years?  Now, is there an odor that comes from it?  No, it's not like...  It's not like Voss's.  It's just blood.  Is it just blood?  Any pus?  No pus.  You know what?  I don't know.  You ever pull any hairs from it?  Yeah.  No.  No hairs.  It's an open wound?  It's just like a hole, like a...  I don't know.  Fuck that.  I just broke out my camera. 
[02:29:30]  Fuck that.  I'm going to miss your fucking website, by the way.  I love...  Has Steve ever followed around with a wine bottle catching the drippings?  I'm going to say it's enough.  The old Steve's come by.  What, there's tushies and bloody assholes?  I'm here.  Blood oozing holes.  Blood oozing holes.  We were all just staring at him, waiting for him to finish that long-winded bomb.  And what do we got now, right here?  Apparently, he has just told us that there is a hole inches above his asshole. 
[02:30:00]  That oozes blood.  Okay.  Sounds fantastic.  This is Puddle of AIDS.  Yeah, we're doing TV and radio at the same time here.  Okay.  Hi, Mom.  So, now, doctors, without even seeing this, do you have an idea what this is?  Yeah.  And you've seen it before?  You've actually had it for your life.  It just became clinically apparent to you two years ago.  Oh, shit.  All right, let's...  Is it time to look at it?  Oh, God.  Yeah.  Drop him.  Oh, no.  I don't know if I even...  Steve's right over there.  Really?  Go ahead.  Ah, Steve's right over there.  Well, maybe by the door and kind of... 
[02:30:30]  Do you have some paper towels?  It can get messy.  Oh, shit.  Was it a super soaker?  There's a good chance it stinks.  Ah, it probably does.  I haven't smelt it.  It's near his ass.  Yeah.  All right, you guys ready?  Where would you like me to stand?  I'm at ground zero, Ant.  Well, go by the door so everyone gets a view.  Yeah.  Well, not that way.  Yeah, spin around.  Ope needs lighting for his camera.  All right.  Oh, God.  It's a very hairy situation.  I apologize.  He's got a hairy ass hat.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  He was a hobbit in a former life.  There's some napkins for you.  Here, give them to him, just in case. 
[02:31:00]  There's a hole right here.  All right, they're spreading his ass cheeks open.  They're taking a look.  Get a mic on the doctors so we could...  That's it?  What, want me to...  Not draining right now, but...  It's not draining?  What is it, like a fucking geyser?  It's going to make it bleed.  It's going to make it bleed?  By how?  Oh, faithful.  You're like a skunk.  I put a little pressure?  A little pressure and it'll start bleeding?  Yeah, get gauze or a napkin.  We'll drain it out.  Nothing.  Nothing.  Oh, Jesus.  You can't do a money shot?  All right.  As far as bleeding extra assholes go, it's a bust. 
[02:31:30]  Oh, but he has it.  It's there.  Doctor, I don't know which doctor wants to start, but what is this?  It's called a pilonidal cyst.  Do you concur, Dr. Steve?  Do you concur?  I do.  All right.  I like when doctors concur.  Hold on.  Steven S. from Bayshore has just changed your name to Puddle of Anal Cancer.  It's a Native American name.  It's going back to the original Cherokee. 
[02:32:00]  Oh, God.  So what causes this?  What can be done about it?  Give us a little background.  It's a small ingrown hair at the cleft of your ass cheeks.  It's actually congenital.  What does congenital mean?  You're born with it.  You're born with it.  Oh, you're born with it.  Very good.  From the beginning.  To the layman, I wanted that.  Absolutely.  Of course, I know.  I watched Discovery.  You get this overgrowth of tissue around it and forms a cyst.  And because it's closed off, it keeps on filling up with pus and then it'll form a sinus tract to the top of your ass. 
[02:32:30]  And that's what's draining out all the time.  Wow.  So get rid of it.  You actually have to get the whole thing excised.  So what about, I would gather the root, the follicle has to come out.  Exactly.  That's why excise, cut out.  Cut out.  Excise, cut out.  Can you do that at home with a melon ball?  No?  Not advised.  I like home, you know.  Only if you're going to serve it later.  Oh, later.  Only if you're going to serve it later.  Hey, you went there first.  I know.  I don't know if he wants to call in today, but my brother Brett does his own surgery. 
[02:33:00]  He's one of those guys.  Really?  He does home surgery.  Yes, he does.  What is the biggest procedure he's done?  I'd have to ask him now.  What's his anesthetic?  Same thing Dr. Steve was drinking last night at Maryland.  He's had a lot, but I think the biggest one, he had a nail gun accident, and he removed  it himself.  That's kind of dangerous as far as nerves go.  Oh, yeah.  He just fucking took it out of himself.  Wow.  Yeah.  But he's had a few over the years.  Wow.  A few nail gun accidents or other accidents? 
[02:33:30]  Yeah.  He's good with his hands, but gets into some problems every once in a while.  What about if you notice a small, like a skin tag type thing, and you just take nail clipper  to it?  Yeah, that's okay.  Fine.  Yeah, yeah, fine.  That's all we do with them.  Yeah, yeah.  That's all doctors do with them anyway.  I say, I mean, just make sure everything's clean, right?  Right.  Sure.  Bleeds like a motherfucker.  I don't want to.  Yes, it will.  Absolutely.  Infection.  I can't do it like Jimmy does.  Secretion.  No, there's a... 
[02:34:00]  Yeah.  Yeah.  Some people get them on their necks, and I've taken a hundred skin tags off of somebody  in one sitting.  Holy shit!  And we just use a real sharp pair of scissors, and you put a little tension on it, and just  snip it off.  Will you take a little thing and snip it off?  It'll heal without a scar.  That's a secret ingredient for the wine?  Skin tags?  Skin tags.  Fry them up and make crackling bread.  That's an absolute...  Now you're talking, absolutely, and now we're in Louisiana all of a sudden.  We're two states away from my favorite place.  I think I blew my friendship with Dr. Steve. 
[02:34:30]  He hasn't looked at me since...  Yeah, I think you did.  ...since the note writing.  No, I just feel bad.  I'd be the same way, though.  Why do you feel bad?  I feel like I, you know...  What are you talking about?  Please, Dr. Steve.  No, not at all.  How great is it that now he feels bad that he let the show down?  It's not...  Because you're a fucking asshole, and I'll never talk to you again.  Not that you're a dick and reveal his inner most secrets.  He's bummed that he let the show down.  He feels bad, right?  He feels bad.  Honestly, we made something into it.  It's fine.  Okay.  No worries.  All right.  So what do we do with Puddle of AIDS?  I guess he's got to go, what, to a doctor?  Can we do it here? 
[02:35:00]  Is it a doctor's office procedure?  No, no.  It would actually be a small, local anesthetic surgery.  Just a local...  Yeah, it depends on how big they are, because you don't know until you open it up.  So once you get in there, you'll see how deep you have to go.  What is it, like, a brundlefly hair in there?  Yeah.  Brundlefly.  Exactly what it is.  Brundlefly.  That's what pyrone idol means.  Brundlefly is good.  Can you take a potato, like, peeler to it?  Yeah, that would work, too.  In the crease of your ass, potato peeler.  You know what I mean?  And just slice, layer by layer.  You know, you're peeling potatoes, and you've got to get some of those eyes out. 
[02:35:30]  The doctor doesn't recommend that.  No.  All right.  How about a Dremel?  Just take a Dremel tool, and just go right in there, and just start Rotorooting with  a Dremel.  And by the way, just another thing you could do with a Dremel.  Absolutely.  They're amazing.  It's a thousand and one uses.  A thousand and two now.  We actually do use Dremel tools.  Excising an anal series.  Excising.  Why don't we do this?  It's a great start to what the hell is that.  We'll take a break, and we'll continue with Dr. Steve and Dr. Mike.  Yes.  Puddle Age, you're going to have a seat.  Enjoy the rest of the show.  Well, don't have a seat in here.  We sit in this place, or any fucking spots. 
[02:36:00]  Yes, and a plug for Vic Henley.  Where are you going to be, sir?  I'm at Bridge Street Live tonight in Connecticut.  Our boy Norton is at Foxwoods, and we're taking over.  It's every White Trash Hillbilly Festival in Connecticut.  So you're basically saying if you're on your way to Foxwoods.  Right, and don't want to gamble.  And you run out of gas or something.  And don't want to gamble.  Come see me.  Go see Vic Henley.  Come see me.  There'll be the same amount of bitterness and awful hate.  I want to see your act now.  I want to see Vic Henley badly.  I've never seen your stand-up show.  You're not missing anything at all.  I've seen it on TV.  You're not missing anything at all.  So that's a great plug for your cake.  I downloaded a bunch.  It's very funny. 
[02:36:30]  I really appreciate it.  Thank you.  I think he's going to become a new friend of the show, this Vic Henley.  I have no problem with him.  All right, more with What the Hell is That in a few minutes here.  Sirius XM, the virus.  This is the O.P. and Anthony Show.  The O.P. and Anthony Show.  Yeah, we're doing What the Hell is That?  We've got Dr. Steve in studio.  We also have Dr. Mike in studio.  We've got Vic Henley, a very funny comic.  You've got to thank Jim Norton for that, Vic Henley.  No, I do.  I always do.  Every day I know my prayers.  Yeah.  Fuck Jim Norton. 
[02:37:00]  Well, as soon as I saw you, I go, of course, I know this guy.  But Jimmy's like, you've got to have Vic Henley on.  I'm like, who's Vic Henley?  He goes, trust me on this.  We're like, okay.  You've given me a ride downtown, and that's not a euphemism.  I've actually been a couple of times doing spots, and I'm like, hey.  And Norton's like, hey, we're going down here.  And I'm like, who's driving us?  He's like, it's O.P.  Wow, O.P.'s your limo driver.  You're doing well, Norton.  You're doing really well.  I needed something to do when I was off the air.  This guy, IMPB32 on Twitter, he writes, to be friends with O.P., you have to live like an abuse victim. 
[02:37:30]  Pretty good line coming across to Twitter today.  All right, who are we up to?  I guess we have our next case coming in.  They're all sitting out in the waiting room, getting all fidgety.  What do your doctors do?  Well, actually, do either of you, or have you had a private practice?  Yeah, yeah.  Now, that whole, are you ever conscious of how frustrating that wait is?  Yes, absolutely. 
[02:38:00]  You are.  And then the wait after the wait.  Seinfeld has talked about that, where you go, and then you've got to go into the office,  and then now you're waiting on the butcher paper.  Yeah, you're conscious of that?  Yeah, and it's the wait without any explanation.  You know, if somebody just would come out and say, hey, he's running a little bit behind,  we're going to try to get you in, and, you know, then people pretty much can tolerate that.  It's just the arrogance in some doctor's offices where it's just, well, your appointment's at one. 
[02:38:30]  Yeah.  Can I help you guys out?  Yeah.  You guys always have some help, right?  Yeah.  You know, some secretary or something.  You just tell us, have the secretary go, look, I'm sorry the wait's so long, but one of his patients just died in there.  That's right.  And there's nothing.  Right.  I'm sure that's exactly what you're saying.  But then you would understand, if you're sitting in the waiting room, why the wait's so long.  And now he's at the hospital.  Do you want to see?  They've got to clean up, you know, one of the examination rooms.  We just had to excise a bloody asshole second opening.  Then we'd understand.  Then we found the AIDS. 
[02:39:00]  A couple of AIDS got cut in there.  And actually thin out the waiting room.  Right, right.  A little bit.  Speaking of AIDS, sir, we have a new...  Hi.  Hi, how are you?  Hi, I'm fine.  What's your name, sir?  I'm Dave.  You're Dave, and do you have an internet name we might know?  Yes, Hate Speech Radio.  Oh, you're Hate Speech Radio.  Yes.  Nice.  You know, Dave married Heather Heights.  Of course, I was just doing it for the audience.  I'm just going to put it in his plug-in.  Actually, I know nobody.  So, it's like, who is he?  I meet people, and I just don't know them. 
[02:39:30]  Where's this Hate Speech Radio for the people that want to know?  You can listen to us every Sunday night at 6 p.m. on BrickHouseRadio.com, the new home  of Reverend Bob Levy in Levyland.  Very good.  Which you can hear every day at noon.  Very nice.  Wow.  Trying to leave you back on the air.  That's what he's doing since exile from...  Yeah, I know.  Yeah.  Am I even allowed to mention his name?  Probably not.  I don't know what's going on with it.  Hate Speech Radio based in Pulaski, Tennessee.  Based in Pulaski, Tennessee.  They just cut it short and call it radio down there. 
[02:40:00]  Exactly.  Plano radio.  Just Plano radio.  It's just radio.  Same show every day.  Why put the redundant title in?  We call it Tuesday.  We just call it Tuesday.  Also, I also want to remind people that Dave takes dildos in his ass from his...  I sure do.  ...lovely bride, Heather Heights.  There we go.  How do you not?  Strap-ons, right?  Is that part of the problem?  Is that part of the problem?  Not today, no.  Oh, good.  That's what the hate's based in.  That's the awkward.  The hate is based in that.  We're saving that for after 10 a.m.  Yes. 
[02:40:30]  Oh, very good.  Sir, what's your problem?  Well, since birth...  Uh-oh.  So, let me say congenital, I'm going to say Dr. Anthony, so this is a congenital problem.  Yes, yes.  I've suffered from a condition called epidemiolysis bullosus.  Oh, he's giving the name away.  I'm not supposed to give...  To make the doctor seem smart.  Oh, did I?  It's all about the doctors looking smart today.  So now you know what it is, but now our audience is a little perplexed here.  I'm still out.  Well, for that, I'll default to the two medical physicians to describe it. 
[02:41:00]  No, no, just describe what you have.  Yeah, you describe in layman's terms what you have.  Right.  And then we'll go to the doctors to see what it is and how it's caused and all that fun  stuff.  My skin blisters and rips very easily.  All right.  And you take a dildo in your ass?  Yeah, fuck.  Wow, you are a glutton for punishment.  Does that cause some problems back there?  It's called play him with fire.  Surprisingly, no.  No, she's gentle because she knows I'm delicate.  Yeah.  Now, what causes this? 
[02:41:30]  Is there a certain thing you have to do to cause blistering?  Sunlight, heat, rubbing, what?  Yeah, basically just bumping anything, smashing.  If I bump into something, it'll cause a blister.  So where people would normally get a bruise from bumping it, you get these blisters and  the skin kind of tears off?  Yeah.  You're like a monster.  Dr. Mike is very excited.  He hasn't seen one of these in a while.  You can tell.  He's like a Snoopy dance.  Hey, God, you're just willing to participate.  Dr. Cool.  We can show you, like, one of the coolest things in medicine. 
[02:42:00]  Oh, wow.  There's something this disease has called Nolkulski sign that if he's willing to do it, we'll do  it right now.  Nolkulski played for the Angels back in 1979.  Middle linebacker for the Bears.  Oh, fuck.  You're right.  I'm sorry.  Middle linebacker for the Bears.  Yeah, yeah.  Whatever.  I'm just...  Whatever.  I am nothing new with this.  It sounds like a name.  So what does this do, Doctor?  It's essentially what he's describing, where he's banging into things and he starts to  blister.  If you take your forearm and just rub it like that, you're going to get this big vesicular 
[02:42:30]  blister that can rupture.  Whoa!  Get out of here!  Well, I'll tell you something.  I already beat you to the punch.  Oh, shit.  He rubbed his...  He's looking at his leg.  Oh, he's doing it on his leg.  Wait, wait, wait, wait.  You're dramatically fucking...  He's unveiling his...  We don't do anything without cameras rolling, sir.  All right, well...  Take two.  Ready?  Okay.  All right, well, Sam's on the scene.  Go ahead.  He's rolling up his pant leg.  But I still want to do what Dr. Mike is suggesting.  Well, let's see this first.  Yeah, the Indian burn.  The Indian burn to the max. 
[02:43:00]  That's your kneecap.  Ooh, God.  What did you do to your kneecap there?  Well, it's funny.  33 years of having this, these things happen on accident all the time, that was a bitch  to make happen on purpose just for the show.  Wow, and that's what happens when you just rub...  What did you have to do to attain that?  Because it looks like that would be a normal person really fucking slamming down on their  knee.  Like, if you're at the roller rink in shorts, which is hot, by the way.  Or if he was on his knees taking a dildo in the air.  Yeah, that's right.  On a wood floor covered with sand. 
[02:43:30]  Exactly.  Let's get his leg up on the counter here.  Sandman Sims.  So Vic Henley and the rest could...  Oh, that's nasty.  How'd you do?  That is awful.  Now, is that full of blood, Doctor?  What does that fill up with?  Lymphatic fluid?  It's just clear fluid.  Fluid.  Fluid.  Fluid.  Regular.  What happens in this disease is the epidermis and the dermis are two layers of skin, and  they're usually held together by sort of a Velcro situation with these little hooks. 
[02:44:00]  And you can...  There's three different kinds of epidermolysis bullosa, and one of them, you lose the hooks.  So you don't have that attachment of the top layer to the bottom layer.  For the truckers out there, it's like you blew a retread.  There you go.  I just want to kind of keep it real for the truckers.  That's perfect.  That's absolutely perfect.  And so you can have a version where you have a defect in keratin, there's another one where 
[02:44:30]  you have a defect in the ability to make collagen, so...  Wow, is there any...  And his is obviously really a mild case.  Mild?  Yes.  People do die from this.  Get the fuck out of here.  Yeah.  Yeah, there's some people...  Oh, Jesus.  Knock my headphones, y'all.  What happened?  What happened?  I don't know.  But Dr. Mike, very excited about this, right?  Dr. Mike, you don't see this often?  No, no, no.  Is this a rare disease?  And it's pretty rare.  And it's not contagious, right?  No.  It's autoimmune.  Yeah. 
[02:45:00]  Autoimmune?  Yeah, his body's attacking itself.  Oh, my goodness.  And it...  More laughter.  It ate away all of the little hooks?  Like...  I would...  I would...  Disagreed slightly with that.  Oh, shit!  Oh, face Dr. Mike!  Face Dr. Mike!  Fuck Dr. Mike!  Take that shit!  Dr. Steve does not concur with your bullshit!  It's the one I'm talking, Steve.  It's the one I'm talking.  I love it!  Come on!  Epidermolysis bullosus is a genetic disorder where they... 
[02:45:30]  The autoimmune disorder that causes a similar thing is called pimpfagus.  Ah, pimpfagus!  Pimpfagus!  Face!  Face, Dr. Mike!  The Roman goddess of whoredom, pimpfidus.  Pimpfidus!  I am pimpfidus!  I think I would concur with Dr. Steve only because this has run through my mother's side of the family  for four generations now.  Four generations, and they continue to be selfish and have kids.  That's right, Mike.  What the fuck is wrong with people?  That's why I'm not having any.  If you've got a disease like that, good for you!  Yeah, it's a thing called autosomal dominant, and what that means is you don't have to have 
[02:46:00]  two genes, you don't have to have a gene for mother and father to get it.  You could...  Just one gene will do it.  Oh, great.  It couldn't have been Lotto, huh?  Had to be this one.  What about fucking, my friend?  Because the skin on your penis...  Surprisingly, never an issue.  Wow!  There you go.  What?  Fucking?  Never used it.  Never used it.  Never did it.  Never used it.  Yeah?  No problem?  So you're faking, obviously.  Doctor, why would that not be a problem if the skin on the penis is different?  He's a lucky man. 
[02:46:30]  Because you've known cases where that does happen?  No, um...  So, yeah, actually...  Oh, now he's conferring with...  We've got a little conferring going on.  I like that.  Did we?  But, you know, in a serious case, that'd have to be an issue.  I would think...  Lots of lube would take care of it for the most part because, you know, it does take some  shearing stress to cause the blister.  So you've never seen a blistering cock?  No.  No.  Oh.  But I've seen it so severely.  Have you ever seen a blistering cock?  I have. 
[02:47:00]  I'll just break it into a musical number.  I don't.  Now, Anthony, let's go back to Dr. Mike.  Dr. Mike, you want to give him an Indian...  If he's up for it.  Oh, God.  I'm not an Indian burn.  It's totally up to you.  You can end up getting infections from it.  I said, can we do it on the other knee?  Is that something we can do?  Boring.  It needs to be smaller.  He wants the smaller arm.  All right.  Fine.  I love that.  Just a small spot.  What are we doing now?  Tell you what, I'll do it for plugs.  Oh, yeah.  No problem. 
[02:47:30]  No problem.  That way you're not coerced.  What?  Hair?  Sorry.  That's a hair plug.  Wow.  I'm moving back here.  You know what?  He's going to...  Just in case.  He's not dynamite.  Well, I might spew.  That's true.  You never want spew on him.  Depending on the severity of his illness may or may not happen.  You know, the thing that I more worry about, like, if this thing ruptures, you can get  a superficial infection from it.  You know, you really need to be consenting to this.  I consent, sir.  All right.  What are we doing, Dr. Mike?  He's going to put the gloves on.  He's putting gloves on.  That's never good. 
[02:48:00]  He's picking up a rusted nail and driving it through his forearm.  Yeah.  A little on my elbow.  Oh, whatever.  You did that?  Aw.  Yeah.  God, you're a fucking little delicate daisy, aren't you?  I'm like a flower.  You are.  Dr. Mike is putting on gloves.  What are we doing?  We'll see if we can demonstrate an old Coltskin sign.  And I guess that is...  Dude, he doesn't have fingernails!  Why?  What happened to him?  He doesn't have fingernails!  Really?  Oh, God.  Show me your hands.  The skin doesn't support them.  They fell out. 
[02:48:30]  The skin doesn't support fingernails.  Is that part of the disease, Doc?  Is this known to be...  I have no toenails either.  I would assume.  Wow, his fingernails...  The skin can't support the fingernail.  Some people have such a severe version of this that their fingers will fuse together and  they'll just have...  Going their whole life without being able to give the Vulcan salute.  Exactly.  My God, just cash it in.  Or a permanent Vulcan salute.  Yeah.  None.  No toenails either if you want.  No toenails.  We'll trust you on that one.  I believe him. 
[02:49:00]  I've said it before.  I'll say it again.  You never want to have something that makes your doctor go cool.  Yeah.  Wow, that is so true.  All right, Dr. Mike, where are we at?  Let's see.  You ready for this?  And I guess that keeps you from working out.  Hold on here.  All right.  And what's the demonstration here?  Oh, man.  Oh, shit.  He's rubbing them pretty hard on his forearm.  Yeah, it is.  Right.  All right.  I've never really blistered where there's a lot of muscle and fatty tissue.  It's always been close to joints.  So you're probably better off doing it like on an elbow.  Well, let's see.  Give me the other arm.  Let's see.  Oh, God. 
[02:49:30]  That's already off.  That's already off.  Your elbow's already fucking gone.  God damn.  That one's already got it.  Yeah, he's already peeled off both his arms.  You know, I wouldn't do it anywhere else.  Yeah.  Yeah, that's, well, you know.  You can lance the big one on my knee if you want to.  No, that's good.  Okay.  That's good.  All right.  What's the plug, sir?  Let's, again, Hate Speech Radio, Sundays at 6 on Brickhouse Radio, the home of Levy Land  and Bob Levy.  Hey, and Heather Hite, live at C.J. Wellingtons in Franklin Square, Friday, October 22nd, 9 
[02:50:00]  p.m.  Plug my wife's dates.  There you go.  Good for you.  That's another way of saying something else.  You just earned another dildo in the ass.  I sure did.  I'm a lucky boy.  I was going to have two skinned knees.  Someone wants us to play the Violent Femmes Blister in the Sun for you.  Great song.  Great song, right?  I think Henley likes the Violent Femmes.  I got girl trouble up the ass.  That's my favorite Violent Femmes.  That's an obscure one.  He could play that one for him, too.  That's right.  Exactly.  I'm trying to chip in.  I do. 
[02:50:30]  Did you see his no fingernails?  Yeah.  That's freaky.  Yeah, that's creepy weird.  How come you could get shit like that, but not superhero stuff?  Yeah.  You know?  Like, yeah, yeah, my skin fucking blizzes and my fingernails fall out, but it's like,  it can't be, oh, I'm impervious to bullets.  Check this out.  You always get the shit stuff, but never the good stuff.  Poor bastard.  It's no good.  Yeah.  Oh, that's not good.  All right, well, and there's no cure, doctor?  No treatment?  Well, actually...  They're just shaking their heads.  No, no, no, no, no.  No, no, he's done.  We were talking about this earlier.  Go ahead.  Yeah, we were talking about this in the office. 
[02:51:00]  I was doing a little reading on this so I could, you know, pretend to be intelligent  about it.  And they're in clinical human trials for a curative procedure.  Oh, great.  You're done.  Yeah.  That means maybe someday.  Yeah.  They're talking about, for some reason, which Steve doesn't understand why this would work,  but bone marrow transplants seem to have a curative effect.  Yeah.  Dr. Steve said that about a fucking sinus infection, too. 
[02:51:30]  He just, he blurts it out.  It's like Tourette's for him.  Just bone marrow.  Just yells out bone marrow.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Bone marrow transplant.  Bone marrow transplant.  And, you know, for David, his disease is so mild, and the bone marrow transplant is  such a big deal.  Yeah, that sounds like a pretty big procedure.  You have to kill every cell in your bone marrow, and then, you know, you're completely  without immunity for a while.  Now, Dr. Steve, isn't that where the red blood cells are produced?  Yes.  In the bone marrow cells, too.  And the white blood cells.  So how would you live if you have to destroy it?  Well, it's temporary.  Then you add, you know, more bone marrow cells, and they take up residence. 
[02:52:00]  And if you're not a match, then you've got to take...  Take medications to prevent graft-versus-host disease and all this kind of stuff.  So, you know, for him, I don't think I'd recommend it, because it is somewhat...  There's risk to the bone marrow transplant, and his disease is so mild.  I wouldn't do it if you could do a pirouette inside your skin.  Fucking fuck that bone marrow.  People that have life-threatening disease, I would certainly... 
[02:52:30]  I just like how y'all take an oath to help people, and both of you were gleefully celebrating  harming this man.  Yeah, we've got it.  We've got it.  We've got it.  We've got it.  We've got it.  We've got it.  I haven't seen...  Since the executioner's sharpening his axe, have I seen a bigger smile on somebody's face?  One last question before we move on.  Is it going to get worse for him?  It shouldn't.  It's going to just stay where it's at?  Well, that's pretty much stay where it's at.  All right.  Good.  We'll get, like, postal steroids and stuff on it.  Let's move on to the next guy.  I've never really...  Other than just moisturizers, I've never really treated it.  Aw, cute. 
[02:53:00]  Just don't bang it to anything anymore, right?  Yeah.  Watch your...  Don't let the door hit your ass on the way out.  Literally.  Just don't.  Who's next?  Oh, my God.  We know this guy.  Oh, here he is.  Big A.  Big A.  I thought we knew...  We're seeing Big A in a different light, though, now, because...  I thought we knew everything that was wrong with him, Dr. Steve.  Well, I'll tell you, you know, last time he was on...  He looks good since the last time you saw him, huh?  He does look better.  Jesus.  Fucking Big A.  Hang in there, will you?  Yeah. 
[02:53:30]  He, uh...  Jeez, man.  Well, we worry about him.  He's supposed to lose weight.  The last weird medicine we had him on, we had a speech pathologist on our show that  diagnosed him.  A little more laughter.  And she recommended a guy here in town...  A shotgun?  She recommended a guy here in town that said he was the top speech pathologist in the country.  Until he hung himself.  And we used some of the Big A and Pat from Unaki fund that Opie graciously... 
[02:54:00]  We don't talk about my charitable contributions.  Kindness.  I don't want anyone to think I'm actually kind.  But I cut him a deal.  They said, you know, I said the guy doesn't have insurance that'll pay for this.  What can you do?  And they said, well, we can do a fiber optic stroboscopy, and we'll only charge you $250.  And this guy is the greatest speech pathologist in the country. 
[02:54:30]  So we sent him, and he had the thing done.  And I got a report back from the greatest speech pathologist in the country that said,  diagnosis, stuttering.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  Recommendation.  Speech therapy.  No shit.  So glad I donated.  Oh, yeah.  I want my money back.  God damn, man.  All right.  So that was a big question.  What do you got today, Big A?  Actually, we had a...  Is this how desperate we are?  We just brought Big A in? 
[02:55:00]  Well, you know what it is.  He had a compacted, impacted colon for a while, right?  Didn't he?  Yeah.  Have that whole thing with the cement in your ass, and you got a...  What do they call that when they wash it out?  Didn't they stick a tube of water up your ass?  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Yeah.  How'd that work out?  Are you shitting better?  It's called a good Friday night.  Right.  Wow.  Now, I think here's why he's in here.  Before, we noticed, when he was really struggling with those S-T words, he starts profusely sweating. 
[02:55:30]  The veins pop out of his head, and he has to step back and catch his breath.  And we're all waiting.  Is this because he is out of shape?  Oh.  Well, I mean, that goes without saying.  Yeah, of course it does.  He's got one artery that's not clogged.  You had to bring me in from Philly to figure that one out?  Yeah, really.  Breaking news. 
[02:56:00]  Puddle of AIDS' ass is officially bleeding.  Oh, wow.  Oh, nice.  Finally.  Finally.  Just in.  Just in.  It is bleeding, right?  A little shy at first, but...  It was a little shy at first.  God, I'm going to have to wait another hour with my camera so it goes off again?  Here it is.  Uh-oh.  All right.  I could do without this, really.  Yeah, I know.  They're quietly conferring with each other.  Yep.  Oh!  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God. 
[02:56:30]  What is that?  Wait, Travis, we haven't heard from you today.  What did you just say, man?  Here you go.  Travis, let me see the picture.  Hold on.  Oh, God.  Let me see.  Oh.  Oh, fucking egg!  What?  What's happening?  I've got an impuddle of AIDS squirting blood throughout your studio.  Oh, wow.  Fantastic.  Explain it to the audience, Travis.  Well, it's exactly what he said it is.  It's a bloody hole right above his ass.  Oh, my God.  And he's rubbing the blood all around.  That's good.  Oh, that is fucking disgusting. 
[02:57:00]  You really need to change your name.  Holy shit.  You really need to change your name.  Ass blood.  Vampire fountain.  Vampirefountain.com.  Oh, my God.  All right.  That is disgusting.  Oh, God.  Jesus.  Oh, no.  Okay.  Oh, God.  Damn it.  I'm getting an odor, too.  I think there's an odor.  Oh, is there?  I think there's an odor, too.  Is there an odor?  I'm not really sure, but I think there's an odor.  You've got to get a picture of that.  There.  Thank you.  Okay, right.  I'm not wrong.  Dr. Steve's licking his lips.  He's like, I can make another vat of wine. 
[02:57:30]  All right.  All right.  Fucking stigmata ass.  Suddenly, this Jelly Phil Duncan is not really settling in.  Yeah.  Notice how no one's eating the jelly donuts anymore.  The wrong donut, Vic Henry.  Dr. Steve, were you looking at Big A?  Is he coming back on the program?  Was there something we were going to check out?  Yeah, he's got a thing on his.  He's got something.  I saw you guys kind of talking non-verbal.  What, like Fez?  Assist?  What do you got?  Abscess?  Tell us about it. 
[02:58:00]  Oh, boy.  Did you have to say that?  We only have a half hour on the show.  Oh, Jesus.  Fez just, uh, uh, Fintex.  I mean.  You got something that grew under your arm.  Yeah.  I hope it doesn't sting.  I figured we could have E-Rock smell under there, too.  Oh, yeah.  Very good.  Oh, E-Rock.  Oh, E-Rock.  Now, uh, you have something under your arm.  Um, is it, is it, does it feel, uh, surface, or is it deep in there?  What is it?  Um, it's... 
[02:58:30]  It's an easy question.  Is it on the surface of your skin, or is it, like, deep in your armpit?  Um, it's in, uh, uh, uh, actually, it comes out.  Okay, so it comes out.  Is it soft and mushy, or is it hard?  Um, it's soft.  Hmm.  Why don't we take a shower?  That doesn't sound very serious, Doctor, right?  Is it some kind of infection?  Wait.  You're going to have to unbutton your shirt.  We're going to have to go with the, uh...  Oh.  And you can take your one arm out.  You don't have to be totally, uh... 
[02:59:00]  Yeah, yeah.  Da-da-da.  Da-da-da-da.  Yeah-da-da.  There he goes.  Just so the good doctors can get a good...  Holy shit.  There he goes.  It's like watching Fat Houdini.  Yeah.  Fat, slow Houdini.  Yes.  What do we got?  Okay, these are, uh, classic, uh, skin tags or acro-cordons.  What?  Why?  Acro-cordons?  What's that mean?  I heard that once in Star Wars. 
[02:59:30]  What's that mean?  Right.  Activate the acro-cordon.  Yes.  What does that mean?  What's that difference from skin...  Is that just a clinical name for skin tags?  Yes.  What causes those, Doctor?  You know, it's probably genetic again.  Something that, um, uh...  Why does the skin decide to just do that?  I don't know.  And it happens as you get older, too.  Oh, fucking A!  Oh.  Wow.  They're like bungee cords.  Can we chop one off today?  Oh, God.  Don't.  Well, let me see.  What?  Let me see.  I don't care.  All right.  They have a real narrow neck and a big, fat, fleshy... 
[03:00:00]  Fleshy pouch.  Pouch.  Is that just skin tissue, or is there anything in it?  Uh, there's blood vessel in there.  Yeah?  That's why they bleed so much when you...  Oh, God, no.  We had some surgical scissors.  What we would normally do is...  Just get a fucking knife.  Do a sterile prep.  Just take forceps and put some tension on it, then snip them off with scissors.  So you can get as close to the skin, regular skin, as possible? 
[03:00:30]  And you usually don't have to use any anesthetic because...  God damn it!  No nerves in there?  No, there's nerves in there.  Ah.  But the thing is, is that...  Some nerves.  If you stick a needle in there and start pumping lidocaine in it, that'll hurt for about  10 seconds, and if you just snip it off, it hurts for about a quarter of a second.  Oh.  Oh, wow.  Wow.  Just pull it off and throw them like a hand grenade.  Okay.  Oh, E-Rock!  E-Rock!  E-Rock!  Oh, E-Rock!  E-Rock! 
[03:01:00]  E-Rock, could you give a sniff to Big A's skin tags?  All right.  All right.  E-Rock's going to sniff Big A's underarm.  Hmm.  You got this, E-Rock.  No, that's not bad.  Not bad?  All right.  All right.  Big A.  All right.  A little hygiene in there today, Big A.  All right.  Not bad.  All right.  So he's got some big-ass skin tags.  Did you suggest he smell the bleeding?  Um...  I was going to say that next.  That was going to be my...  And, no?  Big A?  I mean, not Big A.  There was an odor. 
[03:01:30]  Yeah, there was an odor?  Can you...  We need to confirm that there is an odor.  Why?  Not from Big A.  Well, no, no.  From the bleeding...  From the bleeding asshole hole.  Just to keep it all medical.  Part D.  Yeah, just keep it medical.  We're just keeping it all medical.  Well, the bleeding asshole's not the problem if it smells...  Why don't you just smell his bloody ass?  The bloody, bloody ass.  All right.  He's, um...  One asshole smelling another one.  Yeah.  Here we go.  All right.  Elephant walk.  Come on.  Smell in the crack. 
[03:02:00]  Smell right in there.  Get in there, E-Rock.  He cleaned it off.  Smell the fucking...  Oh, he's pushing it again.  Get in there.  Give a sniff.  No.  Oh, wow.  Wow, you were pretty close, too.  E-Rock likes it.  E-Rock loves the smell of manhats.  He likes it.  He gave two thumbs up.  Wow.  That is...  E-Rock is a trooper, man.  He really is.  Can't we just pull a tag off, man?  Ow!  Yeah, look at Dr. Mike.  He's like, let me couple it off.  No, he's very ready.  Can you do it like when you used to tie a tooth to the door? 
[03:02:30]  Just going to yank it off?  Good idea.  I got some dental floss.  Can we do it?  What a work.  Oh, man.  All right, are we moving on?  We're bummers.  So those are interesting, but Big A, do you want the bad news?  Uh-oh.  Uh-oh.  This isn't so smooth.  So when's the last time you've seen a doctor, legitimately?  Oh, shit.  Here we go.  Big A's going to die.  Oh, no, no, no.  Oh, God.  Big A, last time?  Checkup?  Um, it was a couple months ago, but I wasn't too happy with the doctor. 
[03:03:00]  With the doctor or the diagnosis?  Of course.  Blame the doctor.  Jesus.  The doctor.  The doctor?  You want to find one that's going to tell you you're completely healthy?  You're fine.  You're fine.  Your cholesterol's a little low.  You could use a few more pounds.  If you came to see me in my office, you'd be fine.  But here, I'll tell you the truth.  Yeah.  So, you likely have something that's called Obesity Hypoventilation Syndrome, otherwise 
[03:03:30]  known as the Pickwickian Syndrome.  Pickwickian?  Yeah.  Is that like Don Wicklund?  Wait, wait, Dr. Steve, you, you, what's the word?  Yeah, we've actually, yeah, we've talked about that.  Oh, Dave conferred and concurred.  All right.  Holy shit.  There's no doubt.  There's no doubt that you have this.  Do you sleep with a machine, a BiPAP?  Were you told you're supposed to?  A sex toy?  He was told he's supposed to.  Sleep with a machine, a dildo?  Oh, wait, he gave up on the sleeping machine, too?  Come on.  Hey, hey.  Listen.  Andrew.  Andrew. 
[03:04:00]  All seriousness?  Because he got apnea?  Yeah, he has the worst form of apnea.  So, what Obesity Hypoventilation Syndrome is.  Wait, how do you know he has that?  I'm sorry to interrupt.  Oh, you can tell just by looking.  You're amongst friends.  Don't worry.  I'm willing to bet.  If he pulls up those pants, his legs are swollen like this.  Without seeing it, I'm willing to guarantee.  You pull up his pants legs, he's going to have these big, swollen, red,  erythematous legs.  Really?  Yep.  Do you have it, Big A?  I'll bet money.  I'm not showing it.  Oh, shit.  Big A, don't worry. 
[03:04:30]  If you're still alive, you can still come to my party.  Okay.  It's fine.  Okay.  So, people who have sleep apnea because their weight ends up collapsing their windpipe  a little bit at night, and it obstructs the air going into their lungs.  When certain people end up getting so large, that same phenomenon happens during the day.  You're walking around, not effectively breathing at all.  Because of that, you're constantly having this small amount of damage to your lungs,  and that ends up causing, like, a backflow that damages your heart. 
[03:05:00]  And that's why you're now getting these big, swollen legs, because your heart's not effectively  pumping from never breathing correctly.  Wear the machine.  Damn.  Wear the machine.  What if he walks on his hands for the next half of his life?  That would do it.  You were wearing the machine for a long time.  Just suggesting I'm not a doctor, suffice to say.  What?  It is very, um, uh, adjusted, yeah.  So, that's also... 
[03:05:30]  Use a casket.  Wear the goddamn machine.  Right, right.  The company that brought you your apnea machine can adjust the mask so that you can wear it.  There's things called nasal pillows.  There's a bunch of different, uh, devices that they can use for that.  And, uh, yeah, I wasn't aware that you had stopped using it.  You gotta get back on that machine.  You gotta use it.  Oh, man.  This is life and death at this point, right?  Well...  Why are we sugarcoating this?  Big A, you gotta do the right thing.  Don't say sugarcoat.  He's overweight.  Yeah, he's had enough sugar. 
[03:06:00]  Big A, thanks.  Big A.  You, obviously, you have to lose weight.  I'm an asshole.  Are you doing anything to lose weight?  Now, you Twitter your meals.  You Twitter your meals sometimes.  And they don't look like the healthiest thing.  It looks like a lot of diner food.  You're a guy on the go, in the car all the time.  Um, uh, I've been trying, you know, not to snack and drink meals.  Um, uh, breakfast I've been having in the egg whites, um, omelets, you know, vegetable. 
[03:06:30]  Uh, no home fries.  Yeah.  Fancy tomatoes.  Okay, breakfast.  What about, like, uh, middle of the day and then dinner?  What are you doing?  What are you doing?  Um, I, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, I'm trying, I'm having less portions.  If you talk to your food, you'd never eat.  That would cure it right there.  Just try talking to your food.  Just talk with your mouthful.  You'll never digest it.  You'll never swallow.  You'll never do anything.  Doctor, is there anything you can do to lose weight?  like a not a quick fix but i mean obviously diet and exercise do you don't your diet's probably 
[03:07:00]  very poor and your exercise probably nil you got to get back on there big a you know  you used to be in shape i saw pictures of you you were what a football player or something  um football manager but yeah manager well so was fucking every fat fucking jesus christ  yeah you know the thing you need to do if you can't do it on your own way to go you know  gastroplastic surgery yeah yeah you need some help some people with this it's so bad and this 
[03:07:30]  isn't a joke they literally need to get traked all the you know they put the hole in their neck  because the obstruction happens above your vocal cord you know from the weight so they trache you  below this way you have a clear you know flow of air into your lungs do you want that yeah the show  doesn't want it either because then big a couldn't speak oh my god you lose a bit  that would that would be terrible i can't have that 
[03:08:00]  no we can't have that big a it would pump up the bit a little bit it would kind of it would renew it  yeah voice box big a i mean think of the possibilities a different accent you get  different voices by different characters batteries one day he's british  all right big a take better care of yourself all right now get the fuck out of here we're running  out of time we got to get some more people in here i know um uh who else we got left out there 
[03:08:30]  two more people two more people okay bring in the next victim how much time does he got  oh you know you have to get a set of blood tests to see uh one number how high it's going and then  you get an estimate and the other thing you could do a take a picture of your heart called an echo  to see how much less it's pumping and we have dealt with this i know you have dark see that's why i'm  frustrated his echo probably goes burn burn him burn him burn him burn burn burn blub blub 
[03:09:00]  dub poor guy there's got to be something um you know obviously it's a mental thing you know  he's dealing with issues i would think that's my diagnosis doctor i like just fitting in with you  guys and giving my own diagnosis as a shock jock i feel i i am qualified i like the more you talk  they just stare at the floor  they just look away shut the fuck up i've never seen a look say shut the fuck up 
[03:09:30]  get the phone out check some messages i know i like thinking we're colleagues as jimmy says men  of similar ilk but uh apparently not uh oh look our next victim what's your name sir where you hail  from uh dave from pennsylvania dave pa uh what any internet name uh wadsworth d on twitter  oh wadsworth d yes i don't follow you i know you don't all right now i'm gonna block you  oh come on i love your twitter wars where i know i'm yelling all the time that's because you have 
[03:10:00]  the same uh let's say um political ideals that i do oh do you yes nice you should follow me i know  i know what your problem is then uh how do we do a racistectomy sir because uh that seems to be his  issue i know where to get him back if you over twitter is that twatting he'll relapse if you  over twitter is that twatting his first bad joke right bad joke threw it out there shouldn't have 
[03:10:30]  tried should have saw an opening fell flat on my face now you're gonna leave i'll go i'm bringing  boss in we're calling him disgrace jim norton right i apologize jim i'm really sorry thanks for  having me on you just thought that didn't hear it the first time you said it right yeah i repeated it  for effect for effect right just just to make sure it was as awful as i thought it was and it was it  was it was really bad no i'm sorry uh sir well what uh what seems to be your major mal adjustment 
[03:11:00]  uh for the past like i'd say like 10 years or so i get these lumps and um where i get i have  one on my face i got one on my back i got them on my pubic region i get them on my ass cheeks  and they kind of they kind of start off hard and then they get a head and then it could take  anywhere from two days to a week and they burst this is is that cystic acne yeah i mean it's going  to be some form thank you doctor we concur but that's what it's going to be another concur  uh so it's some some type of uh you know you know like what comes out of them like a really 
[03:11:30]  fucking party favors what do you think pus and blood yeah pretty much it's like when you pull  those bon voyage things it's pretty much like a rip but a really dark purplish like blood oh wow  should we take a look at us and stuff like that like lizard and crimson scarred like crazy that may  be a little different do you get them in your axilla to your armpit no okay uh so what you're  describing are these uh multiple closed comedones that's that black stuff that you see at the head 
[03:12:00]  before it ends up opening into the you get these sebaceous like cheesy white stuff after the black  comes out god yeah it kind of looks like a volcano yeah but what you're describing in your groin  is a different variant of that that's something called hydadrinitis supportiva  so because chlamydia for sure that would have been easier to deal with that's curable this is  not um so what this is ends up being in your groin there's a different type of sweat gland than 
[03:12:30]  anywhere in your else it's in your groin in your armpits called an apocrine sweat gland so this unique  sweat gland can get these recurrent infections that are rupturing into the cyst that you're seeing  and that's why you get this big matted down scarred area from cyst after cyst after cyst after cyst  bust and bust and bust and bust and that's what happened right yeah yep you had just tons of  them throughout your life they rupture and now i bet you have this scarred red mangled mat around 
[03:13:00]  your god yeah he's happy he's very happy he's very happy i found the check  so some people have it so bad they actually have to get the entire skin around their junk excised out  and then what do they replace it with you graft or close back up is that what it looks like we're  looking at pictures on the internet oh fuck a duck is that sort of what it looks like yeah that's  hydradonitis supprativa mine's not that i'm glad i can't see this picture i'm blocked off but it's 
[03:13:30]  behind very close to good i mean i'm right it's behind the donut box i'm really happy so what are we  looking at on about the other thing or oh fuck man we gotta see it now oh shit god damn  who are you now danny popping up the worst fucking things i've ever seen he has no gag reflex  infected asshole region jesus you oh god oh no not a vagina oh yeah that guy's just fucked 
[03:14:00]  it looks like an m80 went off in his ass it's terrible looks like the elephant man's head so what  could he do about this anything nothing there's nothing like he's just one of those guys that is  fucked why wouldn't uh something like accutane uh take care of that no the only thing that can be  done like you said is you actually do the surgical resection of the skin for people that have it so  severe and so multiple you have to get rid of those glands altogether so it's the glands themselves  that are uh doing that yep and how many like if it's i would say if it's one gland you're pretty 
[03:14:30]  lucky but but like oh yeah you willing to show yeah yeah but you're pretty scarred down oh fuck why  why did i keep it going he was ready to leave right okay all right here we go right in front of  that's a problem holy shit wow okay oh my god you could make up a good story though like you were in  nom and got some shrapnel i know i was just gonna say it kind of looks like elias's body after he was  running from the church fuck dude yeah i was shot in a groin absolutely some sort of kidnapping 
[03:15:00]  story yeah yeah they've done radiation therapy for those people oh christ you what are you what year  is this email me yes um i'll give you my email radiation therapy i found us a new study on something  new and i was trying to look it up i can't remember what it was now but there is something  new for hydratonitis really well since opie even said i'm basically a guy that's just fucked  do you guys know of anything for psoriasis because i know i have that too holy jeez louise 
[03:15:30]  a little psoriasis now psoriasis yeah definitely treatable psoriasis is a disorder that causes  thickening of the skin and these sort of silvery scaly patches usually over uh joints that uh you know  extend but they can be anywhere yeah and uh some people get in their ass crack too and uh that's  pretty miserable and uh there's uh but there's a lot of treatments for it gold bond medicating powder  absolutely gold bond is southern treatment for any fucking disease headaches to syphilis 
[03:16:00]  i used the gold bond it went right all right felt better the next day nothing better than those  commercials with some old ladies talking about her cracked feet right absolutely and her gold  bond on there whatever had it with her you could put some gravy on it too right  southern gear for everything put some gravy on it put some gravy on it wow see i know your shit  that's not that that was a spoof actually i know do you have any any other scarring in other areas 
[03:16:30]  i have scars on my ass cheeks from really just that i've gotten there that's it wow damn how often  do they come up uh those on my ass aren't aren't that often i can just i almost attribute that to  stress sometimes really my mind hives and shit maybe yeah is it itchy does it bother you  no it's just painful until it bursts and there's nothing that can be done is scrubbing every day  keeping the area clean you know that all helps that helps but it won't it won't does it feel good  calling your ass filthy sir does it feel good when it bursts is it's like you've got sometimes you
