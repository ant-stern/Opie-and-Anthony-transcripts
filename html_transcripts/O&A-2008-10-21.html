<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opened with a discussion of Eliot Spitzer's post-scandal life, focusing on humorous speculation about his marital struggles and continued sexual urges.  The hosts imagined Spitzer's internal conflicts and his wife's reactions, using exaggerated scenarios and mimicking Spitzer's supposed furtive glances at attractive women. A caller countered their assessment, arguing that Spitzer's wealth negated any unhappiness, but the hosts disagreed, emphasizing the loss of power and sexual freedom as more significant factors. The conversation briefly touched on the Patriots' win and the Rays' surprising World Series appearance, noting the increase in bandwagon fans.

Next came "Jocktober," a segment dedicated to mocking the "Jack Diamond Morning Show." Opie and Anthony played clips, satirizing the hosts' forced enthusiasm, unnatural dialogue (using phrases like "brr" and "ooh"), and reliance on pre-written jokes from a joke-writing service.  They particularly targeted the co-host referred to as the "hole" for her unsuccessful attempts to rein in the more outrageous comments.  The show's use of canned laughter and derivative jokes was also criticized. A caller echoed these criticisms, reinforcing the segment's point.  The segment concluded with the announcement that comedian Robert Kelly was a guest in the studio.

The show then transitioned into a discussion about a previous sexually suggestive segment ("BGs"), with Opie expressing disgust. This was followed by a poorly received top 10 list, presented by a guest named Jack, about George W. Bush supposedly owning banks.  The jokes were widely panned.  Stand-up comedians Robert Kelly and "Bob" were in studio, and the segment devolved into criticism of Bob's weight loss and stand-up material.  A listener call interrupted, followed by the arrival of Lance Reddick (actor, *The Wire*, *Fringe*).  Bob's unsuccessful attempt to summarize *Fringe* led to further mockery. Reddick offered a better description, but Bob's continued ineptness overshadowed the interview.  The conversation shifted to *The Wire*, Reddick's experiences, and the deaths of major characters.  Reddick also discussed his musical background and current work on *Fringe*. The hosts contrasted the successes of *Fringe* and *The Wire*, highlighting the differences between network and HBO television.  The segment concluded with promotion of Jim Norton's book, *I Hate Your Guts*, and criticism of a politically correct Hillary Duff PSA, focusing on its language and perceived phoniness.

A later segment focused on the use of "gay" as a derogatory term, stemming from the Hilary Duff PSA. The hosts debated whether this constituted hate speech, contrasting it with other words with dual meanings like "pimp," referencing Louis C.K.'s comedy. The PSA itself was discussed, along with comments on the women's clothing. The discussion then moved to a review of the first minute of a "fake Sarah Palin porno," "Nailin Palin," followed by a discussion about gun control, Obama's stance, the Second Amendment, and the NRA.  This included a detailed discussion on different types of guns, hunting, and gun laws.  The segment featured numerous listener calls, including highly offensive messages for the "F.U. line," and a discussion of Rudy Ray Moore's death, with clips from Blaxploitation films accompanied by highly offensive racial slurs. A live PalTalk feed featuring Olga engaging in sexually suggestive activities was also shown.  Robert Kelly, promoting a Boston show, was a guest.  Jim Norton was mentioned but not present.

The show then played audio clips of the song "Boss Nigger" by Ray Williamson and Nervio Martin.  This was followed by discussion of a news story about a TV anchor's brutal attack, speculated to be a sexual assault.  More audio clips of Rudy Ray Mooreâ€™s "Dolomite" character, featuring explicit language and violent themes, were played. The conversation shifted to ghosts and haunted places, specifically Bobby Mackey's Music World in Kentucky, with audio from a paranormal investigation show.  The authenticity of the evidence was debated. Listener calls followed, sharing paranormal experiences and opinions on Bobby Mackey's.  One caller recounted a supposed demon-related incident involving their iPhone; another detailed their experience at Bobby Mackey's; and "ghost hunter" Ted shared humorous and bizarre ghost encounters, including an alleged childhood molestation by a ghost.  The segment concluded with listener-submitted remixes of "Pendulum," with the hosts offering humorous commentary and critique.

A listener contest featuring song remix submissions dominated a later segment. Multiple entries were played and discussed, with callers offering feedback, ranging from praise to criticism. The hosts heavily critiqued some submissions and made numerous crude and offensive remarks. The quality of the submissions and the attractiveness of the female vocalist in one entry, from vannastudios.com, were recurring themes. Opie repeatedly called Matt (of vannastudios.com) a "douche" and a "creep."  Callers offered opinions on the various musical interpretations, and the hosts discussed prizes and a future listener voting process. A running joke involved the pun "Rage Against the Big Queen," alongside several other crude and offensive jokes directed at the female vocalist. Tangential conversations included a nonsensical anecdote about counterfeit pendulums made of cow patties and further offensive comments about the female vocalist.  The segment concluded with the announcement of a "line of the day" winner, more crude jokes, and a final song selection; a brief, unrelated improv class segment ended the broadcast.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road.  Of course you are.  It's my favorite day of the week.  Two for Tuesday.  Oh.  For a split second, I'm like, it's Friday?  Playing all your favorite two-fers.  Yeah.  On your home of rock and roll.  Where's your favorite radio station named after an animal?  A cute little animal.  Fox.  Fox.  Welcome to the Opie and Anthony Show. 
[00:00:30]  On the bunny.  On the bunny?  I've never heard that one before.  We have a lot to do, but we might go with some of that improv for you.  That's some of that improv.  I was telling Anthony, we'll just go with him, see what happens.  But our ex-governor, Elliot Spitzer, I think everyone knows his story by now.  But if you don't, you know, got caught with a prostitute and completely ruined his life and career.  Yeah, he was kind of pretty much thrown out of his job there as governor.  And then we got the blind governor, Governor Patterson. 
[00:01:00]  Governor Google-eyes.  Who, I guess people are saying he's doing a really good job for the state of New York.  Apparently so.  Turns out he's, uh, he kind of wants to, like, govern.  He ain't wrecking things.  No.  That's, uh, that's good enough, I guess.  But getting back to Elliot Spitzer, I, uh, was telling Ant, over the weekend they had a picture of Elliot Spitzer and his, and his lovely bride, Silda.  What's that sexy name?  Silda. 
[00:01:30]  Silda.  Hey, Silda.  Yeah, you gotta, you gotta, like.  Oh, God.  You gotta squish your entire face when you say her name.  Silda.  Silda.  There's a picture of them in the paper because they were celebrating their 21st anniversary.  Now, Elliot Spitzer hasn't been in the news in a long time.  I mean, he, he disappeared.  How do you celebrate your anniversary?  Well, he had oatmeal and she had toast.  They went out for breakfast.  That's it?  That's what the article was saying.  And she had dry toast and he had oatmeal.  That's what their life has become. 
[00:02:00]  Yeah.  That, that is a complete, like, analogy for his wife.  Yeah.  He had oatmeal.  Yeah.  And she was eating dry toast.  So the, the paparazzi, uh, they got a picture of him on the street.  There it is.  From the paper over the weekend.  We'll put this up on onaradio.com.  One of the first pictures, uh, in a long time of Elliot Spitzer and his wife, Silda.  Yeah.  And I was studying the picture and I'm like, man, this guy is in hell.  He does not look like a happy man.  He looks like a ruined man. 
[00:02:30]  He, he doesn't look like the confident Elliot Spitzer, uh, you know, when he was doing his  thing.  And I was telling Ant, it's gotta suck because he's got the bug.  And what I mean by the bug, I mean, he, he, he needs to have sex with other women, in my  humble opinion.  Um, if you are risking your career and in turn destroy your career, uh, because you can't stop  getting hookers, um, it doesn't just go away. 
[00:03:00]  Right.  You're not just going to get caught and go, whop, you caught me.  I guess I got to stop now and be that faithful husband and everything.  He still has such a craving for, uh, new, for some strange, as they say, some young,  new, strange.  Yeah.  Look at the girl he was with the hooker.  And yeah, she was, she wasn't, she didn't look like his wife.  Now, if he's got the bug and this is all our opinions, obviously, why would you stay married? 
[00:03:30]  You got to assume he's staying married because of that's, that's, that's, uh, that's his world.  He probably wants a career again.  Yeah.  This is his, he's got to have the faithful wife and all that by your side.  He's got to do this.  So he's probably torn.  He's like, do I just, uh, say goodbye to everybody and go and get what I really want?  Blow everything up.  Or do I like, like stay with her and, uh, maybe get my career back together in some, in some  form.  Start out as a selectman somewhere. 
[00:04:00]  What does he got to do?  A dog catcher.  He's on a committee somewhere.  Yeah.  But just studying that picture, I, I, I feel bad for the guy.  Cause you know, he just wants to find 10 minutes alone so he could do something nasty.  And do you think she's letting him out of her sight for a second?  Cause she looks really happy.  She looks really happy in the picture.  He looks like, God help me.  Somebody shoot me.  There's just got to be embarrassment in his face when, when, uh, the photographers come 
[00:04:30]  up to take his picture.  Like in his head, he's just like, Oh my God, I had sex with the hookers and now they're  taking my picture again.  And Oh my God.  Oh my God.  And she's just like, well, everything's fine.  We've gone to counseling where, you know, we're working through it.  Like that's just in their head.  They don't say anything.  They just kind of stare at the camera, but you could tell that's exactly what's going  on.  Yeah.  And she thinks everything's fine.  And all he's thinking is, Oh God, I want it.  I want it.  I want it.  I want it.  Oh God.  He's just looking at every girl that goes by, but he's got to do that fake look. 
[00:05:00]  Yeah.  The old, uh, well, where, where, if you're walking, you got a girl that might be a little  jealous, hot girl coming by.  Yeah.  You got to almost do that.  Oh, like you, you stubbed your toe trip kind of thing and then look at your foot.  Right.  But while you're doing that, you'll look at her legs and real quick glance and go tripped.  I used to hurt myself.  I used to swat flies.  Oh, I was like, Hey, a bug.  You just wave your hand in the air and go, Hey, I used to swat flies and I'd be like,  I would do that too. 
[00:05:30]  I would itch.  Like I'll go like, like something is on my nose.  Oh God.  I got a hair on my nose.  Ooh, look at those.  Yeah.  My ex was a very, very jealous of that stuff.  And I, and I know your wife was as well.  So we, you know, yeah, you had to look straight ahead.  It's like, what am I doing?  Put the blinders on.  Go screw.  It's funny.  You guys both employed vaudeville tactics.  Oh yeah.  Of course.  Look at us.  I pull out a top hat and a cane.  I do a little dance, spin around, catch a look. 
[00:06:00]  I drop a banana peel on the sidewalk.  Fall backwards.  Backwards.  But with this guy, you know, he just wants to be on the computer.  Opinions, right?  Yeah.  He wants to be searching for, for, yeah.  And I think what he even just is allowed to go downstairs to get the paper or something.  And the girl is like ringing them up at the cash register.  And she bends over a little and there's a tiny bit of cleavage. 
[00:06:30]  It probably drives him nuts.  It's like, yeah.  And a pack of Wrigley's gum.  And, and to go.  Oh, oh, oh.  And that's all it takes.  All of a sudden he's, uh, well, he's got to go back upstairs and change.  He goes, he can't get away from her.  She's not letting him out of her sight.  You think he's just sitting there going, all right, what can I say?  I got to visit my brother.  Yeah, that's it.  Does he even have a brother?  Got to get out of the house.  I got to visit my aunt.  I got to visit my brother.  You don't have a brother. 
[00:07:00]  I found my brother.  This poor bastard.  He is just stuck.  He can't get away to do nothing.  No, it is a fine balance between trying to keep any kind of credibility, maybe some kind  of reputation that he could salvage and turn back into a political career or just run wild  where they see him in the future.  In one of those whatever happened to episodes and you just see him, you know, hey, turn  to hookers, lost all his money. 
[00:07:30]  Let's go to Whitestone.  Mike, uh, Mike, uh, what do you got?  Hey, what's going on?  I disagree with you.  Yeah.  Well, thank you.  He lives a wonderful life.  See, Mike doesn't get it.  Uh, phone is hard.  Your phone sucks, Mike, unfortunately.  Maybe call back, but he writes, I don't think he's miserable with all that money.  What?  That's, you don't understand money then.  Money without some tang.  Right.  That, uh.  Wow, what is he going to buy?  Another blazer?  Who gives a crap?  He wants to, he wants to buy things with that money that he can't buy anymore. 
[00:08:00]  He must be saving a lot of money.  He wants to go on those nice little trips and, you know, yeah, no kidding.  Do you think she looks at the bank statement and just goes, oh my God, the amount of money  he was spending because now we're just, we're loaded.  Right.  Look how much money we're saving.  He had around a middle class income.  Yeah.  Another bank account is just chock full of cash.  I think Mike's way off.  It doesn't matter how much money you make.  If, if you can't do what you want with your money, it doesn't mean crap in the end. 
[00:08:30]  He lost his power too, man.  He lost who he was.  Right.  The governor.  He's a schlong in a gilded cage.  Yeah.  He can't, can't use it no matter how much cash he's got.  And in this picture, it's kind of cute to see that he's holding the business section  of the New York Times.  That's the section that is very visible.  You'd know he'd rather have like the village voice under that arm.  Some of those ads in there.  Or a laptop.  He just carries her under a laptop with it open and onto Craigslist. 
[00:09:00]  And a widget with two breasts on it.  Is that what you got, Jimmy?  Well, that's just click.  I can't wait.  I can't, can't take time to log in.  And you know, she probably has them on AOL parental controls.  Oh yeah.  To watch them.  She's checking everything.  Everything.  Oh, I see.  One of those programs that send her an email if she goes to the inappropriate site. 
[00:09:30]  That's what I mean.  The AOL parental controls where they alert you of your kid's activity.  Dude, you are probably so right.  He probably, they probably have a block, a, what are they, an internet block?  They probably sat down because they're one of these power couples and like, they live  in that world where you need to be married and all that crap.  So she probably made a deal with them.  Look, this is, you're going to do all this stuff.  She put a black light bulb in the laundry room.  She checks his socks every time he throws them on the watch.  Anything that glows.  She probably goes as far as to measure his, you know what. 
[00:10:00]  All right.  Got a full leader still.  Turn that light on.  It looks like a Peter Max painting.  Yeah.  That poor bastard.  Do you know though, it's survivable.  They say in politics, well, the only thing that can really kill you is a dead girl or a  live boy.  Right?  Yeah.  Fantastic.  That is survivable if he doesn't go to jail.  Yeah.  He can come back in a couple of years as a new man and run for something again.  People like Spitzer. 
[00:10:30]  Yeah.  Just, you know, hey, you know, I had that bad time I went through, blah, blah, blah.  Acknowledge it.  You're still there with the wife.  So you must be a stand up great guy.  He probably has like an ankle bracelet.  One of those freaking like, uh, what do they call it?  Or an invisible fence around the yard.  Yeah.  Yeah.  He runs out and gets shocked.  He has a shock collar on.  A little GPS section on his.  Well, Elliot, I think we're going to have to turn the voltage up.  It went a little far, uh, off the property.  Just saw that picture though.  And it said a lot. 
[00:11:00]  And then to hear what they had for breakfast to celebrate their 21st anniversary.  Oatmeal and toast.  Oatmeal and dry toast.  That's become his life.  Oatmeal and dry toast.  You got the article that goes with the picture?  Because he's not talking.  Oh, here it is.  Uh, it's been seven hard months.  Get it?  Because, you know.  I don't think so.  Uh, since, uh, Silda.  Silda.  Awoke to the news that her husband, blah, blah, blah.  Hookers, blah, blah, blah.  Uh, blah, blah, blah.  Blah, blah, blah, blah. 
[00:11:30]  Uh, seven months since he ripped a hole in her heart and left her with little to do but  cry.  Oh, shut it.  Now's the couple mark their 21st anniversary together with outward, outward warmth.  An exclusive Daily News picture shows, uh, shows that.  People close to Silda says, uh, she has made her peace deciding to stay married to the  man she fell for at Harvard Law School and to keep her family whole.  Clinton, you know, he got through it.  He was president for God's sake, you know? 
[00:12:00]  And, uh, yeah.  Him and Hillary, no matter how phony it is, uh, they show that public affection when they  have to, and that's going to be the next big story in the next few months, the divorce.  It's different when we cheat, I think.  Yeah.  Men, it's different.  We're different.  For women, you're more likely to murder your wife for cheating than she is to murder you  for it.  Yeah.  You know what I mean?  It's just.  Yeah.  Her crying days are over.  Said one person was close to Silda who, like every person interviewed for the story,  asked not to be identified.  As best she could put what happened behind, she has. 
[00:12:30]  She is looking forward to what's next on the horizon.  She has a lot, a lot invested in the marriage.  It's hard to read this on this computer.  Uh, and her three children, the former rising corporate lawyer who sacrificed her career to  her husband's political ambition, raising three daughters, has even gone back to work.  She's working.  Uh, I'm, I'm looking for their quotes actually.  That's another reason they're still together.  Okay.  She sacrificed a law career.  Yeah.  His political career.  Yeah.  He's done if they get divorced.  Yeah.  Done. 
[00:13:00]  If she goes into court and goes, here's what I gave up.  Here's the potential income I gave up.  Yeah.  He would have to give her every penny.  Mm-hmm.  In a divorce.  They celebrated their anniversary at a deli having breakfast.  She had toast.  He had oatmeal.  They shared laughs.  Asked if he was doing anything special for this anniversary.  The man who was never at a loss for words was tongue-tied.  Oh, man.  They throw those words in just to make you laugh.  Ever the loyal wife, Silda rescued him.  Having breakfast, she said with a big smile. 
[00:13:30]  He threw the oatmeal on her face.  Something it's used to seeing.  Yeah.  Had a flashback.  That'd be great.  Just dropped it on her back.  Yes.  A little turnover.  Yes.  He didn't even pay the cashier.  He just left the donation under the tip cup.  Money on the table.  They don't handle the money.  They think that makes them immune from prosecution.  Yeah.  Hey, take this with you.  Oh, that'll never work in court.  If he just pointed at the bureau and he put the money there.  Oh, I guess you had nothing to do with the transaction.  Idiot.  I don't want to tell you.  Do you think he's in hell, though? 
[00:14:00]  I mean, you can't just cure yourself a prostitute in seven months like that.  I don't know what he's been doing if he's been doing.  I imagine he's in couples therapy and stuff like that.  But the power that he lost, it isn't like he decided to quit.  He got caught in midstream.  And that's a rough one, man.  He lost to being a governor.  He lost a major gig.  Your whole life is built towards going there.  Harvard Law, this is what you want to do.  Where do you go from there?  Yeah.  Like, he'll always work.  But it's like, Jesus, you were the governor of New York. 
[00:14:30]  Yeah.  That's a big gig to blow, man.  That is a big gig.  He just, you know, you reach that point where you just, whether it's prostitution or just  habitual cheating or something.  But, you know, with him, it's got to be prostitution.  I can't really see him going into some place and, you know, sitting there on Pal Talk.  Like, hi, I'm Elliot.  Elliot 20462.  Yeah.  Just putting the camera down below his waist around there.  Right, right, right.  Right, right, right. 
[00:15:00]  So it would be like Gov 69.  Yeah.  Gov.  All right.  Wow, someone typed Elliot today.  E-I-L-O-T on the pad data.  That's brilliant.  Oh, that's the girl, right?  Is that Ashley Dupree?  Ashley.  She's aight.  She's sexy, but she's aight.  She's not worth the entire state.  No, no.  She's not worth power over the legislature.  You might blow your gig as the governor of Rhode Island for her, but not New York. 
[00:15:30]  But not New York.  What's another dumb state?  There is just something.  Alaska, yeah.  She's Alaska hot if you're a governor.  She's sexy, though, man.  I would definitely.  There's something about her.  Yeah, I would definitely smooch her.  Excuse my language.  A little smooch?  She's like Iowa hot.  Not one of these big states.  All right, we've got to take our first break.  877-212-ON-A.  We've got lots to do today.  It's Jocktober.  We haven't done Jocktober in a while.  Oh, that's true.  And Sam handed in the Jack Diamond morning show out of Washington, D.C. 
[00:16:00]  Heard a lot about him.  Never heard his show.  How about we just jump right into it after the break?  All right.  Good.  Opie and Anthony.  Right.  Congrats to the Pats.  Go Pats!  And their fans.  Big win for the boys.  Blow out.  Were they supposed to win last night?  I don't know much about the Broncos this year.  Pats won 41-7 Monday Night Football.  They're having a weird year.  Obviously, Tom Brady has just messed up everything for the team this year. 
[00:16:30]  But they're doing all right without him, right?  Yeah, apparently.  Yeah.  On and off, I think.  You're right, yeah.  Better than my dumb Jets.  Yeah, the Pats are what?  4-2?  That's good.  That is good.  The Cowboys are 4-3 and they have everybody healthy.  Yeah.  The Patriots lost their head.  Yeah.  And they're 4-2.  Yeah.  That annoys me.  The guy's getting...  That guy, Matt Castle, whatever, he's getting better week after week.  So, who knows? 
[00:17:00]  I know my Jets are going to just be a mediocre team the rest of the year.  I predicted 7-9 for the Jets.  They're 3-3 right now, but they lost to the Raiders.  That's not good.  It's all about big blue for New York this season.  It's all about big blue.  Is it?  Yeah.  Apparently.  Go screw big blue.  Also, the Rays had...  Yeah, a lot of people talk about this.  The Rays.  They used to be the Devil Rays.  You know, that minor league baseball team that's in the World Series.  The Rays had a 150-1 odd of winning the World Series at the beginning of the year. 
[00:17:30]  Wow.  So, if you're a gambler...  That bet would have been nice.  If you put that money down at the beginning of the year, you're...  Some nervous bookies.  You think?  Hoping that doesn't happen.  How much to get there, though?  Like, I always wondered if I was sworn I have to go to Vegas and take, like, the three odds,  say 250-1, 150-101, and put 150 bucks on each one.  If it's, like, 500 bucks you can live without, like, how much to get there?  What do you think?  What are the odds of 151 to win the series? 
[00:18:00]  Do you get anything if they get there?  Is it, like, 80-1 to get there, even?  Oh, yeah.  They get it on anything.  You can bet on how long the guy's hair is, you know, by the end of the season or whatever.  Yeah.  They measure the grass clippings.  Oh, okay.  I bet it was going to be an eighth of an inch.  Yeah, you can pretty much bet on anything if they get there, what teams get there,  what teams make the playoffs, what teams don't.  Yeah, when I go to Vegas and I see the sport, you know, the betting going on,  and it's so, it's gotten out of control and confusing. 
[00:18:30]  Like, I just want to bet on the game.  Well, do you want to...  Pass by that area.  Right to the poker tables.  To the poker or blackjack.  Right.  They're always right next to the poker tables.  I'm like, I don't know what's going on in that sports place.  Everyone's going crazy, though.  Well, we all know the Phillies are going to win the World Series anyway, so let's go.  I'm sorry, Philadelphia.  Go Phillies!  I feel so bad for you because that city will turn itself upside down.  And anyway, win or lose, they're just going to go crazy.  I'm really going to root for the dumb Phillies.  I really want to see Philly get something.  Yeah, man. 
[00:19:00]  It's about time, right?  Well, yeah, plus Tampa's done nothing for us.  They don't come see our events.  Their fans don't even watch their baseball team.  You want to talk about jumping on the bandwagon.  This is a classic example of that.  All of a sudden, they're all fans of the Rays down there.  Yeah.  Look at some old pictures.  No one went to the games.  It was at the beginning of the season, we were goofing on the fact that the whole stadium was empty.  Yeah.  It was empty.  Well, Travis brought up a great point the other day.  They had to pull the tarp off of a section of the stadium. 
[00:19:30]  Like 5,000 seats.  That were never used before.  And I was also noticing in Game 7, I was watching, and they kept showing the crowd,  and everybody had the new logo Rays shirts on.  They just started this year.  You couldn't see a single shirt from the last nine years.  Because that's a sign you don't have real fans.  No.  And they're all clutching their hands in prayer, like, come on, let's win.  Why?  They don't care.  You haven't lived and died with this team. 
[00:20:00]  Yeah.  They're all Yankee fans that relocated to Tampa.  Exactly.  They're basically rooting for the Yankees by proxy.  Right.  Thank you.  I was trying to make that connection.  I don't think I succeeded there.  It's a very tough place to start a team in Florida because they are all transplants.  It's not like you're starting one in some state where everybody's going to live there  and kind of root for their state.  No one cares about Florida because they weren't raised there.  Well, and the same thing happens with the Marlins.  Like, when they're not doing well, nobody goes to see them. 
[00:20:30]  And then the two times they've won the World Series.  Yeah, Marlins fan.  Really?  I think we should start a petition and get all sports teams out of Florida.  Ooh.  Yeah.  I really do.  All righty.  You get on that.  Because they're all transplants.  You make a very good point.  All right.  Why don't we get into some jocktober?  I love jocktober.  We haven't done this in, I don't know, about a week.  We're smacking.  Yeah, we wasted a week's worth of jocktober.  And we only have, what, 10 days left in the month?  Yeah.  Something like that?  Till pull-vember. 
[00:21:00]  Ah.  What happened?  What happened?  It's A.  Oh, it was A?  Studio's not set up right.  Remember, it's A, not Jocktober.  Happy jocktober, everybody, from your friends at the O.P. and Anthony Show.  I want to rock!  It's a celebration of hacky, pukey radio shows and DJs from across this great nation of ours.  Be aware out there today, there seems to be something in the air besides the fall weather here. 
[00:21:30]  Oh, my God.  Would you just kill yourself?  I would go home and just swallow a shotgun.  Crack up the crapola.  It's jocktober.  Jocktober.  There's a person stranded.  There's a show.  There's a show.  It's stranded.  I love that.  I think that's fun.  Yeah, that is fun.  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.  What the hell was that?  Happy Jocktober, everybody, from your friends at the O.P. and Anthony Show.  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha. 
[00:22:00]  And there you have it.  Today we feature the Jack Diamond Morning Show.  All right.  What's Jacktober about for maybe people that haven't heard it yet, Ed?  Well, you've heard of Rocktober, where your favorite radio stations play some kind of,  I don't even know what they do, but for some reason they rock more in October  because you're able to say Rocktober, and they have a bunch of Rocktober promos.  Well, we do Jocktober, where we feature horrific jocks and shows from around the nation, 
[00:22:30]  from your town, and they're just awful, hacky.  Usually they got the hole, which is the woman in there that just goes,  Oh, guys, now stop.  She's there to keep the wild guys in check.  Meanwhile, the guys aren't wild.  No.  And, yeah, today, who do we got?  The Jack Diamond Morning Show.  Jack Diamond.  Out of Washington, D.C.  And what does he do? 
[00:23:00]  He's been down there for a very long time.  I've heard his name.  I just never heard his show.  Mix1073FM.com if you want to play along at home.  Play music?  Yeah.  They play music?  Yeah, they definitely play music.  Do they have a hole?  I thought he was a talk show host.  Well, it's a talk show that also plays music.  They took the talk away from him?  It's always fun.  Oh, you know, we want you to start playing a record or two an hour.  Yeah.  A little bit of music I don't think could hurt.  Oh, boy.  Oh, boy. 
[00:23:30]  That means whatever talking you're doing, less of it is better.  That's what they mean.  They don't mean more music is better.  They mean less you is better.  Has it gotten to the point, because a lot of stations will do this,  they decide that they want people to talk less,  and they force the jock to play sweepers that say,  let's talk more music.  The Jack Diamond Morning Show.  Which means I suck.  That's why they're making me play more music.  Basically, management feels like you want to hear this song 
[00:24:00]  for the 10,000th time in your life  instead of me talking about turn events.  Remember when Dave Doucheless, our old program director at AAF,  told us that he wanted us to talk between songs  so that if the music was ending on one song  and there were no more vocals left,  and then there was a song starting that had an intro,  we could talk over that.  It's like, oh, yeah, you sure can get a lot of real good material 
[00:24:30]  out over there and really make a point.  It's like that to me is the useless babbling  that needn't happen on the radio.  He was so clueless.  Just keep the music going, but no, you guys can talk.  Just use that three seconds that you can...  Yeah, okay, thanks, Dave.  What are you doing now?  It ruins the song.  Of course it does.  It ruins the song, and you don't want to hear someone babble  for maybe eight seconds while a song is ending  and another one's starting. 
[00:25:00]  Well, I think the listener feels like the jock is their friend,  so it's like I'm waking up and listening to my favorite tunes  with my buddy, Jack Diamond.  Oh, that's a good point.  Hey, you made a great point.  Sam is an insufferable ass.  That's awesome.  He is just a tool.  There's some awesomeness in this kid.  I don't think Sam has ever been sincere once in the entire time he's been here.  He is obnoxious.  Don't take a compliment that he gives you at face value 
[00:25:30]  because it's never for real.  And the second you leave the room, you're being goofed on.  Yeah.  The only sincere moment with Sam I've ever seen in my life  was when Duffy was going to murder him.  And there was actually a couple of, I really might be a dead person here.  Yeah.  That was self-preservation, yeah.  That was seeing an animal without its fur on him.  Poor Sam.  Let's go to Josh in D.C.  Josh.  Yes.  How are you, sir?  Good. 
[00:26:00]  How are you?  Good.  Right.  Josh.  Now that the pleasantries are over, can you speak?  We're on the radio here.  We'll never meet.  We'll never have a drink together.  Get to your point.  Duffy out of D.C. is a hack.  I'll tell you what.  Everybody tries to hang on his words.  Yeah.  You know, it's like, oh, my God.  They're going to be out on Z's giving him worship all day long.  Well, we're going to give him a nice beating right now.  Knock him down a couple of pegs.  That's right.  That'd be great.  And that'll make us go.  He's arrogant as hell.  All right, Josh.  He's a know-it-all.  Why did I go to this call?  Thank you, Josh. 
[00:26:30]  A know-it-all?  God, no reason to character assassinate himself.  Wow.  Let's start with the Jack Diamond Morning Show,  the featured show for this Jacktober day.  Jack Diamond welcomes everyone to the day and introduces the cast.  Now, we and I and Jimmy, of course, we have not heard this audio.  We like to hear this cold.  Yeah.  Let's pay attention to the date.  Okay.  Okay.  All right.  I think it's from a couple days ago.  I think it might be yesterday, but it's important.  The date is important.  Okay, let's listen. 
[00:27:00]  Washington's Mix 107.3.  Good morning and welcome to the 530 Club of the nation's capital.  Jack Diamond morning show for Monday.  It's the 20th day of Rocktober.  Jimmy Alexander.  There he is.  He works on a mix station.  But it's Rocktober.  You can't rock if you work for a mix station.  The 20th day of Rocktober.  What a puker.  Wow.  How about that voice?  He's got that.  The 530 Club. 
[00:27:30]  What is it?  The 530?  What's the 530 Club?  Is that the name of his show?  No, the 530 Club is, I guess, the talk break that comes on at 540.  Because that's the time.  I like the 420 Club, dude.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I hope 530 is a penal code for something horrific.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Lurking by a schoolyard.  Right.  Oh, my God.  We get to do the puking radio guy today. 
[00:28:00]  We all can do this voice.  20th day of Rocktober.  He's keeping count.  Look, you know, you can't jump on the Rocktober bandwagon if you work for a mix station or a  kiss station.  Or an easy listening or, you know, like a light FM kind of a thing.  Those are reserved for the homes of rock and roll, my friends.  But maybe they just mix a little more rock in.  Oh, and that's what they do for Rocktober.  I've got to hear this again.  Washington's Mix 107.3.  Good morning and welcome to the 530 Club of the nation's capital. 
[00:28:30]  Jack Diamond morning show for Monday.  It's the 20th day of Rocktober.  Jimmy Alexander, Erica Hillary, Bilingue Alley.  It is absolutely freezing.  Brr.  Coming down River Road this morning.  28.  Oh, my gosh.  Degrees.  Brr, all right.  Eight.  Degrees.  Oh, oh, oh.  What's wrong with these people?  Oh, oh, ooh.  No one talks like that in real life.  Not only that, didn't they come to the station? 
[00:29:00]  Wouldn't they know it's cold out?  Right.  It's like he's saying it and they're like, what?  What?  Oh, brr.  Oh.  Like, what did they do?  Take a space suit in?  That's my biggest problem with radio.  None of these guys are real.  No.  Like, if we were doing that break, we'd be like, ah, the weather just sucks today.  Yeah, it's so cold out.  I wouldn't be like, I wore my coat for the first time.  Oh, we'd be like, oh, it's 28 degrees out.  And I'd be like, what?  What?  What?  Brr.  Really?  I came here via Hawaii. 
[00:29:30]  Right.  They were just outside.  Yeah, they were just not long ago.  They know it's cold out, all of them, but they have a brr.  Ooh, really?  Well, I didn't know it was cold until Jack Diamond told me.  It was the deuce chills they were getting.  That was what they were.  Brr.  Ooh.  Listen to that voice.  Ooh.  He said Rocktober without a hint of sarcasm.  Brr.  Brr.  Brr.  They didn't commute into work.  You felt the weather.  Yeah, you know what it was like out. 
[00:30:00]  Maybe they tunneled them.  They tunnel in.  They tunnel themselves into the station every day.  Like Palestinian.  I dig.  To get out.  Ooh.  Oh.  Ooh.  Uh, bilingual Allie.  What does that mean?  I don't know.  I heard him introduce bilingual Allie and then listened for like an hour and a half and never  heard bilingual Allie on the program.  Way to suck in the new listeners, you dummy.  How long have you been doing radio?  What does bilingual mean?  I think it means.  It's a play on.  They're trying to make believe she's bisexual, but she probably speaks two languages for real.  Like there's, there's nothing to it really. 
[00:30:30]  Um, I couldn't even tell you.  I never met bilingual Allie.  Bilingual.  Erica talks about.  In what?  Anyway, find that.  Find that, Iraq.  Hopefully she speaks Greek.  Greek and French.  Against her will.  Against her will.  Bilingual.  She didn't want to give Greek lessons, but her face was in a pillow and there was a big  hand holding her head.  Oh, Jimmy.  She is their Spanish speaking component.  It's a blonde woman.  They have on their page there, Iraq. 
[00:31:00]  You got to go on the staff page, Iraq.  Who's the dark haired one?  Wait, so she's, she's sneaking in a couple of Spanish words.  Yep.  Speaking Spanglish, perhaps.  A little Spanglish.  Oh, what a movie.  Oh.  Erica talks about Halloween being hard.  This is the whole test.  This is it.  Only for sex offenders.  Oh.  Let's see if she's a true hole, Anthony.  Okay.  True hole will do a lot of, oh, guys.  Oh, man.  Goofy looking, but.  Yeah, she has a burn victim smile.  Yeah.  She's cross-eyed. 
[00:31:30]  Burn victim smile.  She's cross-eyed.  Like Doug Henning teeth.  She's smiling because someone took the vinegar out of the room.  Yuck.  All right, here we go.  The whole test, Ant.  Yeah.  Listen for the yield sign, slowing the guys down.  Oh, of course.  Just over the top laughing and giggling and, oh, my.  Typical hole.  Like, why is it all so hard?  Why is Halloween so hard? 
[00:32:00]  So hard.  I mean, the costumes, it's also difficult.  Is it difficult for you this year, or is it always?  This year's particularly difficult because my children have decided that I'm baking for Halloween.  What's wrong with that?  I'm not a baker.  And now they're still talking me into, why don't I make chocolate chip cookies and package  them up for people?  And I keep saying, I don't want them.  They're broken up in the bottom of their back.  Well, parents like me.  Be more money.  My mother would never let me eat that.  Well, this is going great.  For God's sake, she lives in Stepford Town, but there's no chance of that. 
[00:32:30]  Cookie cutter.  No.  No, Jimmy has razor blades.  No.  Don't say that.  Jimmy, that's a horrible thing.  I know.  Ew.  Was that her, or did you hit something?  It was her.  Which one?  Which one?  At the end.  Don't say that.  Oh, no.  That was her.  That was her.  Oh, my God.  I just threw a couple homer clips.  I thought you would hit one of the fake hole clips.  No.  Because it was that over the top.  No.  Don't say that.  Doesn't that just make you angry? 
[00:33:00]  Yes.  Well, a lot.  They're Jimmy, and they also have an edgy Jimmy on their show.  Oh, hey.  Amazing.  Amazing, easy.  He's got to be kept in check a lot, I bet, by her.  Well, he just made a joke about putting razor blades in apples at Halloween, which, I mean,  you don't want to give people ideas.  No.  No.  Oh, my gosh.  That would be crazy.  That would be so bad on the radio.  Wait, did you hear the apple line?  Well, I went back.  Yeah, it's like the last few seconds of the...  It was kind of racy. 
[00:33:30]  They're bad.  Will parents like you baking for their children?  No.  My mother would never let me eat that.  Well, that's...  You know, I mean...  They know us.  For God's sake, she lives in Stepford Town, but there's no chance of that.  Cookie cutter.  No.  No, she has razor blades in me.  Oh, don't say that.  No, but that's a horrible thing.  I know.  No.  Jimmy.  It's just like having Jim Norton on your radio show.  Jimmy.  That's crazy.  Don't say that.  For the rest of the show, I'm just going to be, Jimmy, why would you say that?  That's crazy. 
[00:34:00]  That's crazy.  Terrible.  Why?  Did you hear her laugh at Stepford Town?  Stepford!  Just out of nowhere.  Stepford!  All right.  Even stupid Jack Diamond scolded poor Jimmy.  Poor Jimmy just wants to get like a kid chewing his gums apart joke out.  Right.  And these two conspire against him to spoil it.  Look who it is on here.  Good day.  Wow.  That's who's coming in.  Okay.  Now I got you.  Lance Reddick, yeah.  He's coming in today?  Lance Reddick, he's here at 7.30.  Holy ass.  Right?  7.30?  I recognize him. 
[00:34:30]  Maybe we should prepare for the interview with Daniels from the Wire.  Daniels from the Wire, of course.  Number three here, the Jack Diamond morning show, the featured show for this Jocktober.  We got the crew talking about kids showing up without costumes.  Oh, yeah.  Jack does a mean Mr. Burns impression.  Oh, boy.  He does impressions as Jack Diamond?  Impressions?  Yeah.  The more I listen, I think that Jack Diamond is one of those guys that always wanted to  be like Letterman or Leno.  Like he really wants to be like a funny host of a show.  And so he doesn't just leave the jokes to Jimmy. 
[00:35:00]  He gets his own in.  All right.  And he does his Mr. Burns impression.  All right.  What about the kids who show up without a costume?  Not acceptable.  No, you're right.  Not acceptable at all.  Maybe just like the little teeny mask that you wear.  No.  A hoodie and the scream mask is not a costume.  Yeah.  Exactly.  Because just like Mr. Burns, I'll release the hounds.  Smithers. 
[00:35:30]  No, Rachel.  You've come back.  He sounds like Gleason.  It's not Mr. Burns.  It's not Mr. Burns.  Not even close to him.  It's closer to George Burns, and it sounds nothing like George Burns.  And believe me, I know.  What would it sound like?  I always wondered what it would sound like if George would.  Hey, no costume, no candy.  Yeah.  Get the funk out.  Get the funk out. 
[00:36:00]  Yuck.  Beans.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Why are they laughing when he's doing that voice?  They're laughing, and it's terrible.  Is that him?  He looks like Tim Sabian, man.  He does.  He looks like Scotty from Star Trek.  Yeah.  Like in the last one.  That was...  This is just...  It just makes you angry.  What are they talking about?  This is a huge morning show.  They're actually talking about kids showing up at your house without a costume. 
[00:36:30]  And then, no way.  Does she chase him away?  Like, no way.  No.  If they come here without a costume, she's telling them, hey, leave.  Yeah.  I bet.  They're talking about this like it's an epidemic.  Like, no one gives a crap if a kid shows up at your house without a costume.  Mostly, if they're younger kids, they're poor.  Give them more candy.  No one goes trick-or-treating anymore anyway.  Right.  It just doesn't happen.  Most kids walk around with a pillowcase without a costume.  Frightened parents bang on your door. 
[00:37:00]  They stand 10 feet back just in case you lunge for them.  Yeah.  And then you throw something in the kid's bag, and they run away.  Right.  Everyone's scared crapless of something happening.  And then you also don't put, like, wrap-up cookies.  You're like, what is she?  You wrap-up cookies, and so this is the first thing that got thrown away at home.  You don't take homemade stuff.  Stop it.  It's 2008.  Give me something packaged.  I used to hate the, well, we're doing the break now.  Yeah, now we're doing the stupid break. 
[00:37:30]  Look at what they did to us.  They made us fall right into it.  Jimmy, could you play the part of the hole?  What the hell are we doing?  You know, candy apples, I never liked them.  They got everything sticky in the bag.  Yeah, I got a sticky bag.  Oh.  I meant from the candy apple.  Because like Mr. Burns would say, oh, my goodness.  Candy apple in the bag.  Stop it, Homer.  Homer?  Homer.  Just like you. 
[00:38:00]  Oh, you.  We're good.  All right, I'm not going to do that.  I'm terrible.  Yeah.  Just the houses that used to go the distance and bake and stuff.  Like, I don't want your dumb cookies.  Give me a Snickers bar.  What about the people that would build a haunted house?  The kids would have to walk in the front door and then go through this maze of a bad haunted house-dom  and then leave out the back door with the, you know, their candy?  Yeah.  Uncle Paul. 
[00:38:30]  One little detour.  Yeah, exactly.  He'd watch and then like have one sheet that drops down and cuts the tunnel off and another one lifts up to take an alternate route.  Yeah, the doggy door into the bedroom for the-  Where do my friends go?  Oh, look.  This is the-  He's the ghost that's trying to ride me like a pony.  I get the special treats.  How come the ghost smells like liquor?  Let's say hi to-  This don't taste like a push-up. 
[00:39:00]  Let's say hi to 13-year-old JC from Jersey, one of our regulars.  JC.  Oh, Uncle Paul.  Hey, boys.  Wasn't even waiting for it.  Hey.  If you noticed when Jack Diamond did the impression, no one laughed.  Really?  Yeah, really, play the clip again.  It's hysterical.  They just kind of-  It's directing.  Yeah, all right.  We'll play it for JC.  I think he's right, and he means in the entire District of Columbia, no one laughed. 
[00:39:30]  When he was doing the Mr. Burns, right?  All right, hold on.  Hold on there, JC.  The little teeny mask that you wear.  No.  A hoodie and the scream mask is not-  That's not a question.  Exactly.  Because just like Mr. Burns, I'll-  Release the hounds!  Mmm, Smithers!  Oh, he tried again after he got the little-  He got a little-  Mm-hmm, mm-hmm, mm-hmm.  That was the polite laugh.  And then he tried again.  That we all do.  For some reason, bringing up Smithers.  Oh, God, that's bad radio.  All right. 
[00:40:00]  That is bad radio.  Very good.  See you later, boys.  How are the chicks, JC?  You doing all right?  Yeah, I'm doing good, my friend.  Nice.  All right.  All right.  He got a titter.  He got a polite titter from his clothes.  Yeah, yeah.  All right, we're going to go to JV in DC.  JV.  Yeah, hey, guys.  I just wanted to call and say thanks for making fun of this guy.  I tell you, every morning when I get to work, I have to listen to this guy's pukey voice.  And I make fun of him in the office.  Nobody seems to get the fact that he talks like this all the time.  He takes all these stupid contests for caller number nine and everything else. 
[00:40:30]  This guy's the worst.  It is that typical kind of contest radio voice pukey guy.  Never really breaks that character at all.  We just live in a different world.  There's people in their cars that eat up this crap for whatever reason.  I don't know.  I don't get it.  Yeah, I don't know.  What is it?  Is it safe?  So you could put it on?  The moms driving their kids to school?  Who's relating to this?  Can I tell you, once you point out a hacky radio voice to people, 
[00:41:00]  like I used to, when I was in L.A., me and this girl used to hang out,  I used to always point out Tom Likas' voice.  And I watched the way he talks like that.  And then she's like, I can't listen to him.  It's all I think of is how fake his voice is.  Yeah, the phony voice.  Once you point the phony voice out, people always hear it.  You think he walks around using that voice all the time so people recognize him?  Because like in a store, it's like, hey, yeah, I'll take a couple of those.  And then people are like, hey, I know your voice.  Are you on the radio? 
[00:41:30]  I'm Jack Diamond.  Yeah.  Hey, huh.  He seems to be so pompous that he just starts every sentence.  Hi, I'm Jack Diamond.  And can I have a bagel?  He's probably one of those.  Hey, Jack Diamond with you.  You take a credit card.  Right.  Jack Diamond, I'll fill up regular.  Oh, my God.  Hawk, Jack has his own band.  Oh, no, he doesn't.  Holy jeez, he does.  What does he play?  He plays the guitar.  All right.  Well, there's some Stephen S. from Bashar says there's some YouTube videos of him actually 
[00:42:00]  on stage playing.  The pendulum is swinging back the other way.  Jack Diamond.  This is my version of pendulum.  Why don't we take a break and we'll continue with the the hacky show that is called the Jack  Diamond morning show for this jocktober.  That's right.  Opie and Anthony.  You got this one in or should I do it? 
[00:42:30]  All right.  Ready?  Here it comes.  Rocking till the dawn.  Opie and Anthony on your radio.  The pendulum.  It swings the other way.  The other way.  We got some more of those that came in today.  Thank God.  We'll get into that later.  But we're in the middle of Jacktober.  Look who's in studio.  Robert Kelly.  Robert Kelly live dot com.  Bobby.  Hi.  Playing Boston in the near future. 
[00:43:00]  Right, Robert?  I have a big show Friday night at the Wilbur Theater.  Nice.  Big show.  Big show.  Ticketmaster dot com for tickets.  Go buy them.  Bobby is very, very funny up on stage, man.  Very good at the virus shows when I've seen him out.  Rarely because you're always playing so far away from me.  I could play in your house and you'd probably go to take a nap.  Yes, it's probably true.  But Robert killed on the virus show.  Yeah. 
[00:43:30]  So Boston, come on.  Buy some tickets for Robert Kelly.  Wilbur Theater.  Yeah, I sold two.  What are you there?  Two tickets.  Two tickets.  Friday night, the Wilbur Theater.  And then Saturday, I'm in Chicopee.  I hate that name.  Chicopee?  Chicopee.  Yeah.  That's weird.  It's all in Boston.  Chicopee and Peabody.  Peabody.  Don't say Peabody.  No, I said that once and I almost got my head taken off by a boy.  It's Peabody.  Boys, it's Peabody. 
[00:44:00]  If you say Peabody, people aren't going to think you're local.  And we need you to be local.  We know how important being local is.  Remember when we had a drive?  I'll just talk about your state's corruption.  Remember when we had a drive to Signal?  I want you boys to drive the signal.  What does that mean?  I need you to drive around to the absolute furthest point that the signal reaches.  So that way you're in touch with the communities that get the show.  Seriously?  Boys.  I'm like, what? 
[00:44:30]  Dude, it was.  And believe me, I was at that point happy to be there.  I'll do anything for radio.  And even I was like, ugh, that just sounds stupid and unnecessary.  That's an old radio trick, too.  I mean, we're in the middle of talking about jocks, and, you know, it's Jack-tober.  Jack-tober.  The fact is, no matter where you are listening to our voices, your local morning show, for  the most part, is not from your town.  Yeah.  But they have faked it for many, many years.  Yes, they have. 
[00:45:00]  By studying how you say the town's right.  When you enter a market, they give you the map with the basic routes and the sports teams  and the mayor's name.  Tell you where the traffic is every morning.  You go, hey, if you're suffering on, you know, 95, coming in, it's going to be bad.  And they give you a cheat sheet, and you do your show every morning with the cheat sheet,  making believe you were born and raised.  And there's a few years.  Radio synesthity.  It's phony.  Why is it just such a fake medium?  And then they force you to what it's called drive the signal, and you're basically driving 
[00:45:30]  one big circle.  Yeah.  And you get to know the areas.  Which was a bitch when we first got the job at XM.  It took, how long?  Four months.  Me and Opie were driving the perimeter of the signal.  Yeah.  And then it started in Canada, so we have to start.  Yeah.  Go get to know the audience.  Yuck.  Yuck.  All right.  Let's get back to the Jack Diamond Morning Show.  Yeah.  Featuring this show for Jacktober.  Jack starts his cavalcade O'comedy. 
[00:46:00]  What's this, Sam?  Yeah.  Did you write O?  No, I didn't make that up.  No?  No.  That sounded like a Sam-ism.  I wish I had made that up.  He has a bit called the cavalcade O'comedy.  Well, yeah.  Like, I started realizing more and more that he wanted to be, like, a late night comedy  show host.  Yeah.  And so he gives himself a segment where he just gets to tell jokes, and then the people  on the show have to laugh when he pauses. 
[00:46:30]  They have to.  Well, it's-  You think-  Is his jokes from Prep Burger?  Some of them sounded extremely familiar.  Really?  Yeah.  Because we explained that to the people.  Like, these morning shows don't even have to do their own work.  They hire a service, and their jokes are in their email every morning.  Oh.  Is this them right here?  Yes, that's Jack Diamond.  I can't stand people who tuck their shirts in.  All right.  Here we go.  Yeah.  It just gets-  Oh, God.  These stupid shows.  I think Jack Diamond's his real name. 
[00:47:00]  Cool.  And now, ladies and gentlemen, a man, Jim Kramer, calls for stock tips.  Who would laugh at that ever?  I-  I-  I-  Why would?  That's only funny if it's about a guy from Lehman who just threw himself through a window.  See?  That's funny. 
[00:47:30]  It's awful.  I feel like Jim punched up his joke.  Made it better.  Yeah, you helped him out.  No.  And now, ladies and gentlemen, a man, Jim Kramer, calls for stock tips.  It's Jack Diamond.  I'd rather hear.  And now, a man, Cosmo Kramer, calls for **** jokes.  That's the joke, right? 
[00:48:00]  This guy stinks.  It's horrendous.  And now, ladies and gentlemen, a man, Jim Kramer, calls for stock tips.  It's Jack Diamond on the Cavalcade O' Comedy.  He's the mad money guy.  Are you mad?  Are you-  Oh, they had to explain who he was.  Oh, they had to explain who he was after the joke did nothing anyway.  He's the guy, you know, from the show, and he does stock things. 
[00:48:30]  Okay.  Are you mad?  Are you mad, too?  Actually, I'm pretty happy the stock market was up 400 points yesterday.  I was pretty pleased about that.  Well, John McCain was on David Letterman's show last night, and admitted he blew it.  It's uncertain whether McCain was referring to not showing up for the first time.  We're actually showing up last night.  Yeah.  A little-  Grilled him.  All right, he's reading this.  That's a prep burger.  This is a prep service. 
[00:49:00]  Oh, wow.  Washington's getting ripped off.  They're paying this guy a lot of money, and he's just reading someone else's jokes that  comes in in his email.  That's all that-  You can tell it's reading.  That's all that prep service does, because I was reading the jokes on the prep service  website, and they take what happened on either Leno or Letterman and make some kind of joke  about it.  I picture these things coming in in the morning like he's standing there just waiting for them.  Probably this old dusty dot matrix printer.  Beep, beep, beep, beep.  Jokes.  These are going to be great.  If you're listening in Washington, you should call the Jack Diamond Show and ask him if 
[00:49:30]  he writes any of his own material.  Or does he get his entire show from a prep service?  Yeah, ask him anything good from the prep service this morning.  Yeah.  He continues with the cavalcade-o-comedy.  Britney Spears went on trial yesterday for driving with an invalid license.  The trial centered on what state Britney called home last year.  Her father testified it was the state of Louisiana, and the prosecution maintained it was the state  of intoxication. 
[00:50:00]  And finally, doctors say, if you play...  As he does that joke, a gas fire should break out in the studio.  Right in the entrance.  They should all be trapped due to a gas fire.  And they're playing the David Letterman music.  I think that's the Conan music.  Oh, the Conan music?  But still.  It's all the same to me.  Yeah, why would that be playing in the background?  It's jokes.  It's comedy jokes.  Cavalcade.  It's a cavalcade of comedy jokes. 
[00:50:30]  Cavalcade, right.  And our listeners, without even trying, are coming up with better slug lines than the  Mad Money one.  A man, Scott Peterson calls for marriage counseling.  And they're just...  They're dopey listeners, and they can write better stuff than this guy's coming up with.  They're calling Steve's coin-purse stomach of comedy.  Not quite a cavalcade.  That's Pat from Winocchio, of course.  A man, Pete Townsend, calls for web addresses.  Barry. 
[00:51:00]  Say, it's easy.  But this guy gets off a prep service.  And finally, doctors say, if you play the BG song, Stayin' Alive, while giving somebody  CPR, or you sing it to yourself, that you have a better chance of saving their life because  it has the required 103 beats a minute.  Of course, chances are, if you're having a heart attack and hear a BG song, you might  rather die.  There's your cavalcade of comedy.  I, um... 
[00:51:30]  Wow.  You know, the BG's.  Yeah, that's a good one.  Yeah.  Just, you know, the BG's.  I love Xan.  What the hell was that?  Oh, my God.  Do you think the rest of the cast there, the rest of the people on the show have to go  home and just take a shower in fetal position?  Because they were just laughing at that show all day. 
[00:52:00]  They just feel like crap.  They don't know how awful they are.  No, they...  You don't think they know?  They have no idea.  They're frauds.  I would just put...  They have no idea.  I would frame a paycheck, put it on the wall so the second I walk into my house, I could  just stare at that for a while and know why I go in.  Just sit there and go, okay, keep it in perspective.  It's for the paycheck.  Just get one of those quarterback things for your forearm and stick it in there.  Just look at it every 10 seconds.  Keep looking at your paycheck, okay.  I'm going to kill myself.  All right.  All right, wait a second. 
[00:52:30]  You want more?  I don't know.  Yeah, we got to do more.  Of course we do.  You do?  Jack list the top ways you know George Bush owns your bank.  Yeah, and there's no...  The same forced laughter rule applies.  Yes.  Well, when he stops...  Is there...  There's a formula here, Sam?  Yes.  When you stop talking, the rest of the people on the show are forced to laugh.  Yeah.  And is this almost like a top 10 list kind of a thing?  Yes, and I believe this obviously came from the exact same source of his cavalcade O comedy. 
[00:53:00]  Okay.  These would be top signs that President Bush now owns your bank.  All righty.  95% of the customers hate it.  Approval rating.  What's funny about that?  Nothing.  Then he explained it.  Then he explained it.  What is funny about that?  Nothing.  Nothing.  But he explained it.  We got two stand-ups in studio.  What is funny about that?  That's kind of amusing if you do it at the White House correspondence dinner and Bush is right there and everyone's uncomfortable. 
[00:53:30]  Then I would kind of laugh like as a comic, like, all right, he really slugged him as hard in front of the president.  But anywhere else, that's horrendous.  Steven S. for Basher.  A man who Larry Craig loves to tap feed with.  These would be top signs that President Bush now owns your bank.  All righty.  95% of the customers hate it. 
[00:54:00]  Approval ratings.  But no one has an opinion on their bank.  Approval ratings.  Yeah, I know it's an approval rating.  Approval ratings.  But no one has an opinion.  Do you have an opinion on your bank, whether you love it, hate it, or...  Love my bank.  Well, if you don't like your bank, you just go to a different one.  You've got stuck with the bank for four years.  Exactly.  You've got stuck with the bank.  I voted in my bank, yes.  I like my bank.  It gives away lollipops and free pens.  Oh.  Commerce.  Funnily.  I have cookies.  Your life savings are being swindled. 
[00:54:30]  It's a lollipop, stupid.  It makes a good point, though.  Approval ratings.  Approval ratings.  The guy's got it.  These would be top signs that President Bush now owns your bank.  All righty.  95% of the customers hate it.  Approval ratings, 5%.  It doesn't ask for your business.  It forcibly occupies it.  That's not even...  Banks don't forcibly occupy anything.  They occupy your business. 
[00:55:00]  Well, they forcibly occupy your...  These aren't making any sense whatsoever, I'm afraid.  These are shoehorning concepts.  Banks don't forcibly occupy.  Yeah, shoehorning.  They marry a girl named Laura.  Shut up.  Bank, you idiot.  But it's like if the war in Iraq was a bank.  Yeah, yeah.  You know?  Occupy.  Then you wouldn't...  You'd go to the bank.  Yeah. 
[00:55:30]  This is just making everyone angry.  We should just drop the Jocktober bit.  But why did he say banks?  He could have said anything.  I don't know, Jimmy.  I don't know.  Why banks?  I don't know.  I'll bet you there's one bank tie-in that makes sense.  The first two have been horrendous.  They don't make sense.  I would believe because of the bank bailout.  Like the government now is pretty much an owner of some of these banks because of the bailout.  So that's the tie-in.  But just don't do the bid at all because it's stupid.  How about this?  Here's the top ten raise.  You know Jack Diamond owns your bank. 
[00:56:00]  It sucks.  That's right.  Like, your bank isn't funny.  All right.  Let's get to the end of this.  Occupies it.  Any customer service complaints are greeted with an invitation to go hunting with Dick Cheney.  Wow.  I'd rather have a toaster.  Oh, I'd rather have the toaster.  Do they even give out toasters anymore?  I was just going to say that.  First of all, it's how long ago did Cheney shoot that guy? 
[00:56:30]  Years.  And when was the last time a bank gave you a toaster?  Maybe they gave one to my parents.  I got a toaster when I joined Commerce.  Did you really?  And a lollipop and a pen.  I told you to fill a tub with water and drop it in.  It was actually an investment opportunity.  Let's go to Charlie in New York.  And at that time, Bob tried, but it bounced off his belly.  At that time, you tried to sneak a fat jacket.  I did, but I hate the new Bob.  Bob is really thin.  Yeah, it makes me sick.  It's getting ridiculous.  At least bring in the fat you lost and put it on your lap so we can goof on it. 
[00:57:00]  That's what we goofed on.  Where did it go?  Like my son?  Like bring it in like a Bob son?  Yeah.  Do something.  I hate this not fat Bob.  I saw Robert at Caroline's here in New York.  Robert is amazing.  I mean, you really should see him at the Wilbur Theater this weekend for everybody up in Boston.  Only Friday at the Wilbur.  Yeah, but there was a crossroads in his career because he went from making fun of his fatness.  And I've seen Bobby a lot and he went from, instead of saying fat guys like myself, he went with chunky guys like myself. 
[00:57:30]  Chunky.  But now I don't even do the fat guys.  Now you can't even do the chunky anymore.  That was like a lot of your material.  I hope you keep going and you die like Karen Carpenter.  Just make fun of him.  Yeah, anorexic.  Anorexic.  Like myself.  Puking Bob.  It's become something else.  Bob, he eats something here and we just hear him puking in the bathroom.  Oh, it's hilarious.  The back of your teeth start to rot out.  They always have bad teeth because of the vomit.  Right.  I'm going to make it real.  Yeah.  You sound like Jack Diamond. 
[00:58:00]  Let's say hi to Charlie in New York.  Charlie.  What's wrong with the banks we got?  They bank pretty good.  What's some of those other banks?  We got Citibank.  Bank of America.  Bank of America.  There used to be Fleet.  Citibank.  There used to be Bank of Boston.  Now it's Bank of America.  Merlin.  Thank you, Charlie.  Is that the end of the banking bit?  Oh, yeah.  Thank God.  We're going to just do one more clip because we got Lance Reddick standing by to come in 
[00:58:30]  and talk to us.  Oh, wow.  We're very excited to have Lance and Lieutenant Daniels from The Wire.  Yes.  And Friend.  And Friend.  It's a massive hit.  That's what they're saying.  One of my favorite shows on TV.  Oh, really?  You're going to be able to help us then?  One of my favorite shows on TV.  All right, good.  We got Lance Reddick, one of the stars.  Yeah, it's going to be sitting right there.  Yeah, it's another J.J. Abrams hit.  Jack Tober ends with the Jack Diamond morning show with this fine clip.  Jack finishes his list with a bang.  More banking jokes?  Yeah.  All right. 
[00:59:00]  Employees get 180 vacation days a year.  Just like he took.  Oh, you know that.  Oh, my God.  He explains every single one of them.  I want to do that this weekend.  Just explain every joke.  Because my father molested me.  How well does this guy do in the ratings?  He's been there forever.  Yeah.  Employees get 180 vacation days a year.  Just like he took.  Oh, you know that tube at the drive-thru?  Sure.  It goes directly to Halliburton offices. 
[00:59:30]  Wow, that's convenient for everybody.  If you withdraw money early, they call you an un-American defeatist.  No.  Yeah.  Un-American defeatist.  And the final way to know that President Bush now owns your bank,  the drive-thru now accommodates big, long cars with long horn horns on the hood.  And that's how you know.  I think that would fit anyway.  Of course it would fit anyway.  When you go to the drive-thru at the bank, they don't stop. 
[01:00:00]  You don't have like an 18-foot car limit.  They don't care how long your car is.  Idiot.  Does it just make you really mad?  Yeah.  It's not even fun for us.  Jimmy's face when he gets mad at the crappy comedy is hilarious.  Dude, that's just so enragingly bad.  It's like he's eating lemons out of a hooker's butt.  It's just...  It'll never work.  Maybe I could have just went with lemons.  It's just mind-boggling. 
[01:00:30]  All right.  That's his morning ratings?  Wait, they were 10th.  They were in 10th place with that?  Wow.  Oh, my God.  Hopefully there's only nine shows in D.C.  That would explain it.  You people love dopey radio.  I don't get it.  When are we going to do Scott and Todd, speaking of dopey radio?  I've got a little pile of just-in-case shows that are... 
[01:01:00]  We can do Scott and Todd right away.  I mean, Scott and Todd's just about ready.  Well, to deal with them, they're so bad.  You've got to make sure you get the best of the best.  Right.  All right.  Another show that's just been hacking it up in the mornings forever.  Yeah.  Maybe we'll do Scott and Todd later this week.  All right.  We should take a quick break.  We've got the man himself in from Fringe, of course.  Lance Reddick.  I'm so happy here.  Robert Kelly.  RobertKellyLive.com.  But the important thing for everybody in Boston, Wilbur Theater.  Yeah.  Go and see Bobby.  Yep.  On our recommendation, if you haven't seen Bobby, he's amazing. 
[01:01:30]  You're going to really have a good time this weekend.  Yeah.  A lot of people probably don't even know you're up there because they didn't give a whole  lot of press in Boston.  So if you're up in Boston, Bobby's at the Wilbur Friday night.  And it's probably a great theater.  Yeah.  Go to Ticketmaster.com for tickets.  All right.  We've got to figure out if we're going to continue with this Joctober bit.  I don't know if people like it or not.  I know it just frustrates the hell out of us.  I like it.  Yeah.  People love it.  All right.  We'll do another one tomorrow.  Opie and Anthony.  I messed up the whole transition on you, Danny. 
[01:02:00]  I'm sorry.  We had the Wire theme music coming back from breaking.  All right.  There you go.  That's the Opie and Anthony show.  He's not here to talk about the Wire, though.  We're starstruck.  I got to tell you.  It doesn't happen often, but we got Lance Reddick, Lieutenant Daniels from the Wire.  He's sick of hearing that because he wants to promote Fringe, but still.  Colonel Daniels.  Colonel Daniels.  I'm sorry.  You're right.  In the last season, yeah.  You're right.  Yeah, right.  Got the big promotion at the end of the show. 
[01:02:30]  Oh, good.  Yeah, thanks.  I'm putting one of these situations.  I got to be honest with you, and I understand this, but I'm putting one of these situations  where I'm late to the party, and I know it's just going to screw me over because I just  cracked open the first season of The Wire last night, and I started watching them and  instantly hooked where I'm just throwing in disc after disc.  I can't get enough.  It's great, but I know that things are going to just get spoiled for me and things like 
[01:03:00]  that.  Well, congratulations on your promotion that you eventually get, and that leads me to  know that nothing happens to you.  Okay.  Well, okay.  See?  Good.  All right.  Hold on.  I got to add to this because Anthony ran in today and said, I'm so into The Wire.  Don't tell me anything about the show.  There's a moratorium on talking about it now.  And then who's our guest today?  Yeah.  And he didn't even know you were coming in.  And Jimmy did this to me.  I was like a season or two behind, so now I'm going to enjoy you getting frustrated by 
[01:03:30]  finding out stuff before you see it.  But I did the same thing to other people with Lost because, you know, actually, I was  a little late to the party on Lost.  A few of the other guys had seen it, and then I caught up.  And then when I was all caught up, I'm like, ah, so you don't know what's going  on, do you?  I don't know what's going on.  Yeah.  Well, most people don't.  That seems to be the thing.  Yeah.  Even if you're caught up, you don't know what's going on.  Are you in, you were in, what, like two or three episodes last season?  Yeah, I was in three episodes last season.  And then I've got an episode, actually, that I'm shooting next week. 
[01:04:00]  Your part is really creepy on Lost.  Like, you play, like, it's a really bizarre, I don't even know exactly who you are in  that.  It's just, you're just this weird guy.  I don't even know exactly who I am.  They don't tell you if you're real or if you're working for the government or who you are?  Just drops in.  I mean, actually, especially with this episode that I'm about to shoot, I have much more  of an idea of who I am.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  It'd be funny if he accidentally blew the whole season and JJ fired him.  Oh, hysterical.  My kids would love that. 
[01:04:30]  Do you go to Hawaii for that?  Yeah.  Yeah, that's always something.  Does everything, is there anyone that goes like, hey, you're doing Lost, you know, an episode  of Lost.  Oh, really?  Yeah, it's a soundstage over here that we're going to just do something in.  I think everyone expects, ooh, Hawaii, this has got to be nice.  It's great.  And I've never been to Hawaii before.  Really?  Yeah.  Yeah, that's one place I've never been to.  I've been there.  Bobby pointed out to you.  I know, you were married there, you didn't invite anybody.  I invited you on the internet.  On the internet.  He had a wedding on the internet.  Like, he went to Hawaii, used all the money that it would take to have a big wedding with 
[01:05:00]  a bunch of people so him and his fiancee could go get married in Hawaii and then gave everyone  a website that they could go and watch him, you know, get married.  Really?  How much is it?  Because it's a hundred bucks.  A hundred bucks.  You cheap bastard.  Do you get frustrated by, like, you know, as an actor, like, you know, you get, like,  a role like The Wire and you see so many other bad scripts.  I mean, how frustrating is it to see a lot of the scripts around there? 
[01:05:30]  You've been very fortunate.  I mean, from the writing on The Wire to Lost and now to this show, which is a smash hit.  It's got to be very frustrating, though, all the other bad, awful scripts you have to go  through or you have to read through.  Wow.  I actually don't get, it's not like I've gotten that many scripts.  And I just feel like I've really kind of just gone from one great project to the next.  Yeah, because you have.  Yeah.  That's what it is.  Yeah.  Yeah, because you probably, if you, you're getting put into that category, though, where 
[01:06:00]  you're looked at as one of these actors that I don't think you'd take a, you don't seem  like you'd take a bad script.  Like, you're, you're, well, you know, as, as the saying goes, show me the money.  Okay.  But no, I mean, I, I, one of the things that's been really cool about what I've been able  to do is that I've been able to do a lot of television and so I've actually been able 
[01:06:30]  to pay my rent.  But at the same time, I've been able to do stuff that was really artistically fulfilling.  You're still renting?  I'm joking.  You should tell me, he's a dude, right?  Oh, okay.  What's the right answer?  This new show is, is real.  I, you know, I was kind of skeptical about if I was going to, cause I love Lost.  I love Lost.  And I was skeptical the first, the first couple of minutes cause the kid from Dawson Creek's  in it.  Right, right, right, right.  Which I, you know, I was like, somebody, but you know, it's going to be a good show when 
[01:07:00]  you, you don't even see him as that cheesy character at Dawson Creek.  You forget all about it and he's just that new guy.  And, well, I mean, in Josh's defense, I mean, I will say, you know, I was a, I was a Buffy  fan.  So I was a Buffy fan.  I was a fan of Buffy.  You just ruined the whole show for me.  So, you know, and I was also a Paula Cole fan.  So, you know, Dawson Creek was always off.  So I watched the first five minutes to hear the song.  Oh, damn.  Oh my God. 
[01:07:30]  What?  Oh man.  You are a great actor.  You are never going to watch broils the same way again.  You're killing it for us.  I'm just throwing my, my wires, uh, DVDs in the garbage.  There's manuals.  Shred them when you get home.  No, but I, but, uh, even though it was like a teen show, I always remember being kind  of impressed with Josh.  And so I was really thrilled when I found out that he was going to be cast in this role.  Right.  And, uh, I think he's doing a really great job.  His dad too is who played.  What's his, what's his name? 
[01:08:00]  John Noble.  He's an Australian.  My God.  He's great.  He's a lunatic.  Yeah.  And could you guys help us along?  Cause, uh, what's fringe about?  Let's get the basics out there.  Cause I haven't seen it yet.  Wow.  Well, in a nutshell, it is this, um, it's this, uh, sci-fi action adventure procedural  that, uh, deals with this kind of elite government team that investigates these super scientific  crimes of terrorism or murder.  And, uh, it basically deals with the question, what happens when, uh, science and technology 
[01:08:30]  advances at such, uh, uh, almost exponential rate that it's, uh, nearly impossible to, uh,  effectively legislate or control it.  But yeah, they have like, but all this stuff, the reason why it's kind of cool is that the  stuff that they do, uh, do on the show that would be unrealistic has some type is based  in some type of reality.  Yeah.  Like they might be able to do that stuff.  Like the crazy fathers, they take him out of an insane and solemn where he's been for  like 17 years and he's just this uber genius guy. 
[01:09:00]  His son is a genius, but he's like a, you know, a crook.  Like he used his intelligence to, you know, make money at cards and stuff like that.  They get him out and they, all the stuff he worked on back in the day, uh, for the government,  they wind up using these techniques.  Like they, they hook this girl up to in a machine with a cow and they, it's just this  stuff that doesn't make any sense at all.  But this guy's such a mad scientist.  He's like, Ooh, it can work.  And he just loses his mind. 
[01:09:30]  But the whole time he's, he's, he's still crazy.  Like he, he has to introduce himself to the assistant every day cause he forgets her name  and it bugs the hell out of him.  I would never have Bob give me a synopsis of a show.  I was just going to say, ever, ever.  The, the, literally it's almost an art form how bad that synopsis was.  And you love the show while they hooked the girl up with the cow and the guy's a little  nutty.  Bob, what are you talking about?  I was, I was, I was nodding along trying to help him.  But it's, listen, it's not, quit the show.  I felt like I was smoking pot again. 
[01:10:00]  It's like, wow, I'm on a real sucky show.  You can back me up on this.  It's, it's really like the stuff they do.  Isn't like, you can't just explain it.  It's, it's not, it's really crazy science stuff that they somehow put together where  it makes sense.  We like, that would never work, but it makes sense.  And they, they do this futuristic stuff.  Well, some of the stuff you might say would never work, but to be, to be perfectly honest,  I think a lot of it is kind of based in, in reality, based in real science.  Yeah.  I will say the pilot, the thing about the pilot, it gets you right away is I think 
[01:10:30]  it opens on a plane and, uh, you know, kind of like the original law stated it.  And, uh, this guy is having some kind of a fit, what was it, a diabetic thing?  He's the only thing where he pulled.  It looks like he's a diabetic and he's having his, you know, a seizure or something.  And he's, it looks like he's injecting himself with insulin.  Yes.  You think that.  And, uh, he starts to, to rot away.  Uh, like his skin starts to, I think, fall off.  Where he starts to, he's dying immediately.  Um, and he starts walking towards the front of the plane and then, uh, everybody on the  plane dies and they're basically a bunch of, uh, a bunch of skeletons on the plane. 
[01:11:00]  Is it, wasn't that like in, in, I don't know this, I might be wrong, but wasn't it like  an, he actually came, became transparent?  No, no.  Well, that's another character.  That's Scott.  That's Scott, right?  That's later in the pilot.  Yeah.  That's actually, uh.  Scott.  Yeah.  Yeah.  He became transparent, like almost invisible.  Yeah.  Right.  Now that's crazy.  It's crazy.  Like, I wish that would happen to you right now.  Just to let you know, they turn on you quick on this show. 
[01:11:30]  You're not, you're not losing weight fast enough for us right now, Bobby.  People on the show, they were like, Hey, help us out.  Now I'm trying to help out and I'm really failing.  Oh, cause you were excited.  You said you've seen every episode.  Yes.  I'm a big fan.  I watch it every week.  I have it on my, uh, Deaver.  Your Deaver?  My Deaver.  It is funny though.  You love the show so much.  Like if you told me to give, uh, say a synopsis of The Wire.  I would panic and give really weird, like details about one scene that didn't like,  you know what I do?  Yeah.  I would give some type of details that didn't make sense, but it's, it's the pilot I saw 
[01:12:00]  really wrote me in.  I just didn't, I didn't watch it after that.  Cause I didn't know what it was on.  Cause I probably should pay attention.  I don't.  The best part of the show though, is one of the things I like is that they tell you  how long the commercial break is going to be.  So you don't mind sitting through it.  It's like, we'll be back.  A fringe will be back in 60 seconds.  And you're like, Oh, that's not that long.  Yeah.  That actually is very cool.  Yeah.  So you're like, Oh, see, I can do 60 seconds.  But if they don't tell you like, Oh, this stinks.  I'm just going to hit pause and come back an hour later.  Well, also our, we, uh, our show, uh, the fewer commercials on our show than normally 
[01:12:30]  there are on other network shows.  Cause I know me when I watch a show and I don't watch much television, but when I do  it, I'm really hooked into something.  Yeah.  And about a year ago, I don't know why, but I started, uh, counting the minutes and  counting.  I started counting the commercials and after sometimes it's like 11 commercials.  Yeah.  Yeah.  It is annoying as hell and takes you like a good writer.  Cannot sit there and go, okay.  And here's where it just will cut off and I have to wait like for 11 commercials and 
[01:13:00]  then start back up again.  Like, it seems like it, the writers would be angry.  Like there are portions of when you see a movie on television, uh, you know, that whoever  wrote that movie, put the movie together, isn't going, this is going to be even better  when you just cut off at the climax of a certain part and then come back to it after you sit  through a few, uh, uh, mopping commercials.  Do you want me to explain that Anthony?  No, I did a fine job.  I think, I think it's, uh, you know, it, it, it interferes with the actual drama or, you 
[01:13:30]  know, the continuity of something.  Especially when you're coming from a place like you did HBO for six years and five seasons  with our hour long episodes and the content is complete freedom.  Um, I mean, is it weird to come back to regular television, even though the show is, is, uh,  it's a massive hit.  I don't think on the fringe you would need the type of content freedom you had on the  wire because you're not dealing with drugs or the language or, you know, murders or any  of that stuff.  Um, but is it weird coming back to regular television after having that kind of freedom 
[01:14:00]  on, uh, on HBO?  Well, it's, uh, it's a little odd.  I mean, say coming back to be perfectly honest, it's, uh, my only experience on network television  really has been as, as, you know, intermittent guest stars.  So I've never had to deal with it on a day to day basis.  So, um, sometimes it's a little frustrating because, uh, we just have to, um, well, first  of all, our show is longer than most network shows because if you're commercial breaks,  so, um, we're trying to get, you know, the amount of content in. 
[01:14:30]  And at the same time, uh, the network kind of, um, has more of a hand in the, the, the  creative process.  So it's a little more, um, there's more cooks.  There's more cooks.  Yeah.  That's always a, that's always a treat.  Wait, wait, wait, wait, however, however, I will say this, uh, the show is still, even  with all those cooks, the show is still great.  Yeah.  And I think, uh, ultimately because it's JJ and he knows, you know, they know, he, you 
[01:15:00]  know, he's a man, you know, we.  We, uh, have a lot of French fans calling the show and they're frustrated by Bobby's,  uh.  They should be.  I apologize to every single one of them.  Cindy in Jersey is going to do a better job.  Hopefully Cindy in Jersey.  Hey, I think that French is kind of a cross between CSI and X files.  I think that probably best explains it.  So that's it.  Punch it out.  Wow.  She did it in three seconds.  Whoa, whoa.  Yeah.  Pat yourself on the back.  I hope when you do that, you hit a tree.  Listen.  Wow.  Now I'm mad that I had memorized my explanation. 
[01:15:30]  They give me notes and everything.  Are you part?  Now you work for the FBI, not the collective, right?  What is it called?  The collective?  No, what is it called?  Jesus.  What is it called?  You know, the, what is it called?  The.  Oh, you mean the pattern?  The pattern.  Oh.  You work for that company.  The pattern.  Well, no, no.  The pattern.  Hey, shut up.  You don't even know about the show, stupid.  Yeah, but it's the deal.  I just get nervous.  I'm staring right at him.  But the job of being on the radio is to bring as many people as possible into the conversation. 
[01:16:00]  And when I get a paycheck from a radio company, I'll do that.  Okay?  Let me back up.  Let me back up a little bit.  Yeah.  First of all, the pattern.  The pattern, yes.  I don't want to be the bad guy here.  I can't believe I frustrated him.  The pattern is not an organization.  The pattern is a description of all these series of weird events all over the world over the past several years.  And how they seem to be all connected.  I actually work for the Department of Homeland Security. 
[01:16:30]  Right.  And she works for the FBI.  Yes.  And she works for the FBI.  And then there's the company, the big company.  Massive Dynamics.  Massive Dynamics.  You don't work for them.  No.  You can't?  Okay, there you go.  No, no, no, no, no, no, no.  Whoop, whoop.  No.  I do not work for her.  I do not work for Massive Dynamics.  Okay, cool.  Bobby is terrible.  You've seen every episode.  $20 says Lance knocks out Bobby's teeth.  We think French is a good show.  We're not really sure yet.  And we're 20 minutes into this, Bobby. 
[01:17:00]  I really am.  But no, no, in Bobby's defense, I will say this.  The reason he asked me that question is because there seems to be some tie between me and the chief operating officer.  Yeah, it's like Lost.  And we don't know what it is.  It's like Lost.  It's not as like, oh my God, you know, Lost leaves you frustrated.  You want to punch a TV at the end of Lost.  It's not that crazy.  But there is this, who does he work for?  Where are they from?  Why are they connected?  How do they know each other?  Like the lady with the mechanical arm. 
[01:17:30]  Yeah, that's a neat and sharp.  Yeah, that's crazy.  I mean, the one thing that messed me up with, she has a fake arm.  Like she's talking to this lady, and then she takes off her arm, and it's just this robotic arm, a sick robotic arm.  Right on.  And she puts a sleeve back on, but then in the next episode, you know, I saw a couple of liver spots on that arm.  So I was like, oh, that's not the fake arm.  No, this is technology, man.  They put liver spots and everything on it.  The end of the pilot, which is so good, because this is typical of J.J. Abrams.  They get you so well.  Like one of the leads, it was a two-hour, and it was the most expensive pilot I've ever done. 
[01:18:00]  It was $10 million.  And at the end of it, one of the lead characters dies.  So they're wheeling him in, and they're like, yeah, he's dead on arrival.  And then she looks at the dead body.  She goes, all right, well, brief him, and then let me know what he says.  And then the episode ends.  You're like, what?  It's just like it's a really, really interesting concept.  And you kind of don't know what's going on, but you're right.  It's not as bizarre as Lost.  It's a little easier to follow than Lost, which kind of made it more appealing, I think.  It's based more on reality, too.  Most of the show, most of the science in it is based more on reality. 
[01:18:30]  Like last week with the pigeons.  That was crazy.  Here he goes again.  Give us a description of that.  No, the pterodactyls.  I just set him up for that.  I was like, the pigeons, go.  It's funny, because he said that, and I immediately thought, oh, shoot, man, I don't remember.  What happened?  What was that with the pigeons?  More importantly, did they give you a broad to bang on this series, like The Wire?  No, no, no.  That's the HBO thing.  It's kind of fun, man.  You were rock and rolling with what's-her-name there on The Wire?  Well, there was two.  There was The Wife, and then there was The Wife. 
[01:19:00]  Well, you know, he got rid of The Wife, though.  That made me mad.  Oh, no, sorry.  I got to tell you.  Oh, sorry.  That was the one thing.  That was the one thing about The Wire that made me mad, because my wife and I had one  kiss, and it got cut.  So we never...  Really?  Yeah, yeah.  And so, ironically, I kept complaining, you know, and I'm watching every episode and  see McNulty getting it with a different woman.  And I'm like, come on, man.  I'm married, supposedly happy, and I never even kissed my wife. 
[01:19:30]  Well, he said, be careful what you wish for.  Yeah, so third season, yeah, it was me and Perlman.  Hey, at least they didn't move him with Omar.  I mean, that could have been...  That would have been...  Oh, man.  But Omar's cute.  He really is handsome.  I mean, it's not gay at all, but kind of respect for the role.  But the interesting thing about Daniel is it was like, The Wire was so great, the way  they kind of teased this backstory with him, and this dirt that they had on him, and him  and his wife, and he was going to have to leave the police force, and they really were... 
[01:20:00]  They really get into his character really, really well, man.  It's a great show.  You know, I don't want to blow it up.  No, that's okay.  I plan on getting blown, but it's just so cool to watch.  I don't care, you know, if I know certain things or anything.  What was your favorite moment on that show?  Well, if you had to pick one, or one that really stood out for you, and Ant, you might  want to cover up your...  Wow, that's a tough...  No, that's a tough question.  I'll get out of the interview.  Like, we asked...  There were so many great moments on the show.  We asked Michael Whalen when he was in, and he said it was...  The one that got him the most was Bodhi at the end of season four, getting shot. 
[01:20:30]  Wow.  Well, I will say my favorite season was season four.  The kids.  Yeah.  Man, there were so many great moments, but...  He keeps plugging his ears.  I think the moment that got to me the most was in season five when...  Here it goes, Sam.  Michael...  Oh, what was Michael's friend?  The really smart kid who ended up being a drug addict.  Yeah, yeah.  I know.  I don't remember his name, but I know who you mean.  Yeah, yeah.  He was in trouble in school. 
[01:21:00]  He was trying to get drug money from the ex-cop who was the...  The teacher.  Yeah.  That was depressing.  Yeah, in the last season when basically he says goodbye to Michael, and he walks off into  the homeless land.  You know, he's kind of taking over Bubbles' place.  Yeah, yeah.  Which happened...  And that was another thing I thought was really cool about the ending of the series, how it  just seemed like all these characters kind of stepped into...  These characters that were coming up through the series as secondary characters stepped  into the roles of all of the kind of primary characters. 
[01:21:30]  Yep.  Showing that nothing really changes.  Yeah, exactly.  Yeah.  Hey, we got to get back to Fringe so Anthony can be part of the radio show.  James and Riverhead, what do you got for Lance Reddick?  What's up, boys?  Mr. Reddick, pleasure.  Thank you.  You guys, Fringe rules, man.  It's just a fantastic show.  The scientist guy, he was from Lord of the Rings, right?  Yes, he was.  Yeah.  He's an excellent actor.  He'll say crazy things like screaming at his son,  Now, go get me some tinfoil! 
[01:22:00]  And then as he walks out, he'll be like,  And if you happen to pass, go get me a root beer float as well.  Yeah, that was horrible.  I bet he delivers it a lot better than you did.  It wasn't...  Yeah, I agree, I agree.  It wasn't horrible, sir, but whatever you like...  What happens is this, like, you want to describe a character that's quirky,  and if people don't know the character, some of the quirks seem odd out of context,  but I'm sure that you would have done a better job if we gave you another chance,  so would you like another chance?  Sure, absolutely.  All right, sir.  How about this one?  The son is trying to give CPR to a woman, 
[01:22:30]  and the father is on the phone with him,  and he goes,  Do you happen to have any cocaine?  I didn't mean to set you up for that.  I kind of figured it would happen.  You were in a no-win there.  Exactly.  Also, the guy with the lab cards went to the bathroom.  Yeah, we were just...  We were just...  Let's go to Denver and talk to John.  John in Denver, what's up?  Oh, and hey, Jim, Bob, Lance, how you doing?  How you doing?  Pleasure.  Bob, you got the interview skills of Helen Keller. 
[01:23:00]  Every time you try to...  She's blind.  You're just so way off.  You're so way off, and then they try to correct you,  and you're...  Well, yeah, yeah, that's what I'm saying, dude.  That's what I'm saying, dude.  Yeah.  You're awful, Bob.  Don't let Bob be nervous.  Yeah, you know what, sir?  I'd love to disagree with you right now,  but you're absolutely right.  Go ahead.  Thanks, Lance.  Hey, have a good job.  You're doing a good job, Lance.  We enjoy you.  Have a good job.  Have a good job.  Have a good job, you nervous loser.  Shut up.  A lot of people are saying you had the Chris Farley thing going,  as you're trying to explain. 
[01:23:30]  Lance Reddick, pardon, fringe.  Chris Farley from...  I'm not going to help you.  You didn't help me.  Have a good job.  Yeah, Terry in Indianapolis, what's up?  Hey, guys.  Hey.  And I love Bobby.  He does a great job.  But I've missed all this.  What network?  What night?  What time?  You're right.  We do suck.  Good point, sir.  As the listeners point out, how to plug a program.  Why would we remember how to do that? 
[01:24:00]  Of course, you know, it's on tonight, actually, at 9 o'clock.  It's on Tuesdays at 9 on Fox.  And, you know, tonight is, I think, the sixth episode.  Yeah.  Maybe we can do this.  And they got 22, by the way.  They got a full season.  Fox gave them a full season.  It's a great show.  Lance, could you come back next week, and we'll all watch the show?  Oh, you mean watch the show on the air?  No, we'll watch the show and be, you know, prepared for this.  And I won't be here.  Yeah, because there's a really good buzz on this show.  Can I get, like, past episodes online or something?  Yeah, probably.  Or we're all looking at them on a disc. 
[01:24:30]  I hate watching...  Actually, yeah, you can watch them online.  Can you?  Okay.  They've been already downloadable, too.  Oh, great.  Is the girl from...  Don't do it that way.  Is she an Aussie, too?  She's an Aussie.  Yeah, yeah.  She's Australian.  What's going on with all these Australian people taking over Hollywood?  I know.  It's funny, man.  I just got hooked on...  I should be talking about another show.  But I just got hooked on Brotherhood.  Right.  It just killed me when I found out the lead was Australian.  It messes up.  Oh, again.  Yeah, you hear them talk.  It's like, this show's really good.  Shut up.  My baby. 
[01:25:00]  She is Australian, by the way.  No, she's not.  She's from Chelsea, Massachusetts.  The blonde from...  I'm kidding.  I'm kidding.  You ass.  But Anna's great.  She's great.  Yeah, she's hot, too.  She's really hot.  So you're...  I'm not at liberty to comment on that.  Why?  Are you married?  No, but, you know, colleague, I can't.  I'm at liberty.  You really can't just say she's sexy?  Hot?  Anna's a lovely young lady.  Wow.  Fuck her when you work with somebody on a set.  That's why I'm not...  I'll never do anything. 
[01:25:30]  I'd be like, yeah, I definitely.  I definitely do it.  Human resources would be after Bobby all the time.  Yeah.  You're also a musician, too, which I didn't know.  Yeah, actually, I was a musician first.  Growing up, I never thought I'd be doing this for a living, believe it or not.  What exactly?  What kind of music?  Wow.  I grew up studying classical music.  I was a pop musician in the closet.  I went to music school to study.  I thought I was going to be a classical composer.  I left because I realized I wanted to be a rock star.  I started acting because I thought it would help my music career, and then acting kind 
[01:26:00]  of took over.  And now I'm writing mostly jazz.  So wait.  You want a classical composer?  Yeah.  Yeah.  That's what I went to study.  I went to conservator.  Are there any new guys coming up in that field?  Classical?  Yeah.  You know the big names, but you never hear a new guy on the scene trying to actually make  it in that genre.  He really is the new Chopin.  Any new hot composers coming out? 
[01:26:30]  You know what I mean?  And I don't follow, I mean, I follow jazz more than I do.  I don't really follow classical music anymore.  Yeah.  Because Billy Joel tried to do that.  He tried to become a classical composer for a minute.  Well, did you actually, I mean, oh shoot, what was the name of the album that had all  classical music on it that he wrote?  I don't know.  I've listened to it.  Man, it's really good.  I would think it was Joe Pan if I didn't know it was Billy Joel.  Well, give it 400 years, and it'll be a hit. 
[01:27:00]  Yeah, I don't love it.  400 years.  Yeah, classical always seems to be a big hit in hindsight.  I'm like, wow, that was really good.  Why did we shun that?  No, let's not trash makes classmates.  Let's make a time capsule for the people that are going to be on Earth 400 years from  now with a, see, we told you Billy Joel would be a hit.  I didn't even know he did a classical.  I had no idea.  Yeah, he did it for like a minute.  No one really bought into it.  But it was well received.  I do remember reading some reviews on it. 
[01:27:30]  But you know what it is?  When you're Billy Joel, people have a huge expectation of what they want you to do.  It's not like, you know, you're unknown coming out of school if you're doing classical music.  They want you to do Piano Man, Pressure, and then get off the stage.  Yeah.  Let Elton John come on and swing it around for a little bit.  So, you have 22 episodes of this.  I don't know what to say to that, Bob.  You're just an odd guy today.  Really odd.  I've never seen Bobby nervous, ever.  Like, I've seen me nervous.  As you have.  When? 
[01:28:00]  That time in Vegas.  I'm kidding.  That time in Vegas.  Bobby, what is going on with you today?  Are you nervous?  You guys struck.  Sir, can I just say something?  I'm very, I just, I'm terrible around celebrities.  We know this.  You guys don't help at all with your silence.  Well, we were waiting for the next sentence.  Because I know you're a huge Fringe fan.  I'm a huge Fringe fan and Lost fan.  I loved them in Lost.  Wire, I haven't watched yet.  I'm going to start watching.  How do you not have seen The Wire?  Because I love The Wire. 
[01:28:30]  I don't have the DVDs.  What would you say?  They're in the store.  I have a Wire question that you might want to cover up.  What would you say is the biggest shock you had in The Wire?  The biggest thing that you were not expecting to happen?  That happened.  Wow.  String of Bell dying.  Really?  Yeah.  Yeah.  You didn't see that coming at all?  I did not see that coming.  When they're doing a show like that, and they're going to kill off a character.  All right, Ant, it's done.  I mean, especially given that he, I mean, let me put it this way. 
[01:29:00]  He was such a heartthrob.  After, in the middle of our second season, some of us went down to the HBO Film Festival,  and half the cast went down to the Essence Music Festival.  Well, when they just went to the Essence Music Festival, he was down there with Wendell  Pearson, Dominic West.  There was a fan club called the Stringer Bellers.  Wendell told me it was like the Beatles.  I mean, the women went nuts.  Really?  Yeah.  Yeah.  So, for them to kill off a character like that, I thought, wow, it really is all about 
[01:29:30]  the story.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  They don't seem, they didn't care how popular somebody was.  They really would wipe anybody out.  I mean, we saw in season five, he's buying cigarettes and he catches one on the head.  And also, to be fair, David and Ed, I mean, when I was shooting the pilot for The Wire,  David Simon said to me, point blank, you know, this is, I've conceived this as a 60-episode  arc, so he knew where the thing was going.  And he kind of told me where my character's going to be by the end of the fifth season.  Okay, but at least you knew you were in.  Yeah.  Whereas, you know, Omar's supposed to get six episodes or whatever he said, and then they 
[01:30:00]  just kept him in.  Yeah, it was the same thing with Bubbles.  Bubbles was, because I, one of the roles I auditioned for was Bubbles.  And Bubbles was supposed to be.  Really?  Yeah, Bubbles was supposed to be a recurring role that was supposed to die in the second  season.  And he was, that's the flip side.  He was so popular that, you know, and he was so great that they just kept him.  What a great character.  Yeah.  All right, we do have to take a break.  So, I can't believe he's dead.  Shut up.  Oh, yeah.  Anthony was doing earmuffs.  That's for that whole segment right there.  I know why I'm nervous.  It's because, Anthony, I had to stand up because Anthony was blocking him. 
[01:30:30]  And I'm not comfortable.  Oh, yeah, it's my fault.  Yeah, of course it is.  Yeah, that's why I'm nervous.  I'm not good standing up.  I can't talk to people standing up like that.  What do I do for a living?  Well, I can tell.  He's a stand-up comic.  He's a stand-up comedian.  Like I said.  You do it when it's here, right?  I mean, he's still on stage.  I can't see you.  Hopefully in a wheelchair.  Lance, where are you off to next?  You have to go somewhere else now?  Oh, not necessarily.  WB?  WB11?  Yeah.  I can stick around for a little bit more.  We got Lance Reddick in studio promoting Fringe Tuesdays tonight, 9 p.m. on Fox. 
[01:31:00]  LanceReddick.com to check out some of the music, right?  Yes.  Very cool.  All right.  It's Opie and Anthony.  We'll continue.  Opie and Anthony.  Lance Reddick was very cool.  Yeah, man.  One more plug.  It's not that the show needs any more plugs.  Everybody knows when it's on.  But it's on tonight at 9 o'clock on Fox Tuesdays.  And it is a hit.  It's a bonafide hit for Fox.  They gave it 22 episodes of full season.  That was a fun cluster F. 
[01:31:30]  Bobby just babbling.  Yeah.  That's J.J. Abrams is the guy now as far as, like, putting shows out and they'll just  instantly be snatched up and be hits.  And movies.  Because the writing is good.  It's good writing.  It's like, if you have a well-written show, because there's so much crap on television.  Mindless trash.  Garbage.  So anything with a real twist and really good acting without cutesy storylines.  Yeah, I'm not saying I'm a genius or anything.  Or I need, you know, shows that are so in-depth that no one can get them. 
[01:32:00]  Right.  But you don't want that just fed to you, spoon-fed garbage.  Yeah.  That's on so many TV shows now.  The same formula.  Yeah.  There was something else that was going on.  I don't think the listeners understand how funny it is that Anthony came in this morning  at 5.  And he goes, oh, I just started watching The Wire.  And I just want to, I'm so into this.  I'm hooked.  And please don't tell me anything about it.  I said, there's got to be a moratorium.  I'm not talking about The Wire. 
[01:32:30]  And the reason is, and I waited this long, and I don't think it was on purpose, but all  the Wire talk died down.  For a while, we had a lot of guys from The Wire coming on.  It was like the last episode, I guess, was on, and so a lot of talk about it.  So I waited and waited, and then just loaded up the first season last night.  And then hours later, mere hours later, Lieutenant Daniels, here he is sitting there, and you guys  are like, what was probably the most surprising, thrilling, unexpected moment? 
[01:33:00]  And I'm just like, every time I had to take my headphones off, I jammed my fingers in my  ears and just couldn't listen.  You didn't hear any of that, all right?  No, no, no.  But what are the odds?  I know.  You just start seeing The Wire, you're hooked, you're like, wow, I'm definitely into this  show, and he's sitting there the next morning.  I know certain things.  I know that Omar gets killed because it was such a big thing and that, but that's fine  by me.  I'm okay with knowing that.  There are other things, because you guys had talked about a lot of little details, but 
[01:33:30]  with a show like that, you can't listen to people talk about it if you've never seen  it, and then start watching it and know who the hell you're talking about.  There's so many characters, so it doesn't matter to me.  But now that I'm kind of getting to know the characters, it was like, oh, I don't want  to hear this then.  It's one of those shows that it's not going to matter, because I was late for the party  as well, and when we were having The Wire guys come in and Jimmy was doing the bulk  of the interviewing, I was hearing plot lines left and right, and it didn't affect the 
[01:34:00]  show.  Like you saw, we had...  We had Michael in here, Bubbles, I don't know their real names.  It's Andre and Tristan.  I forget Chris's real name.  He's just a murdering thug from later in the series, and he was one of the guys that was  in here, and you hadn't seen him yet.  Nope, it didn't matter.  He's a pleasant guy, and you just see him on...  It's just funny, the odds of that happening today.  Way to know our own show, huh?  Yeah, I know.  I didn't even know he was coming in.  Oh, yeah, yeah, he was booked for a while.  I was happy we finally got him. 
[01:34:30]  Yeah.  It's a really good show.  Yeah, I know.  It's funny, he's used to doing press like a lot of these guys do.  TV, you do quick little hits, you do a few minutes, and the interviews are prepared,  and they show a clip of the show.  You know what I mean?  It's pretty much TV, you know what you're in for.  And then he walks in here, and there's just like eight guys staring at him.  So, how is it acting?  Yeah.  Darrr.  A bunch of nervous, starstruck boobs.  I want to get this out.  Jim Norton's book, I Hate Your Guts, not even available for another two weeks. 
[01:35:00]  Two weeks from today, I believe, right?  Yes.  But you can pre-order on Amazon, and we're getting the numbers every day, Jimmy.  It's number 52 on Amazon, but hold it.  Oh.  Number one in the humor category already.  Oh, great.  We sell.  Great.  So, that's really cool.  It's not even available yet.  I was thumbing through it last night.  I didn't make the commitment to start actually reading the whole thing, but I'm thumbing through  and looking at some of the captions you wrote for the pictures, and I was laughing my ass off.  Oh, thank you.  You are just awful.  It's so goddamn funny. 
[01:35:30]  It's pure, Jimmy.  It really is.  It really is funny.  Thank you.  It's going to do extremely well.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, extremely well.  I think it'll blow away the last book, to tell you the truth.  I really do.  Yeah, maybe.  It's different than Happy Endings in that it's very much me, but it's more me attacking.  Yeah, it's just vicious Jimmy, which is great.  You're going to bring a lot more people outside the O&A community because of the people you're  talking about and stuff.  Yeah, I'm doing a David Schuster show on Friday from MSNBC. 
[01:36:00]  It's like they started calling me for those kind of shows.  Wow, that's cool.  But a lot of times, I don't want to do talking head shows.  Do it.  I'll do that one.  But no one cares about a comedian.  When comedians try to be too serious, and they try to go on and go, you know, the Republican  party, but you're like, shut up.  You know what I mean?  You'll be yourself on those shows.  I hope so.  You certainly will.  But thank you.  Do you think this book is going to have any repercussions from the people you trashed?  I don't know.  Legally, no, because Simon and Schuster's lawyers go over it very carefully, and I'm not claiming 
[01:36:30]  anyone's a pedophile.  It's what they call hyperbole and opinion.  I mean, I'm just making fun of people who are famous.  Right.  And anyone who's not famous that I attack, I'm careful about making sure that you don't  know who they are.  I was browsing, man.  Al Roker gets a beating.  Yeah, he does.  Oh, my God.  And Hillary Clinton gets a beating in this book.  Yeah, they deserved it.  Especially Roker.  Awesome.  Yeah, for blogging like that on iMis.  Hey, here we go.  Something from yesterday.  I think Anthony brought to our attention the Hillary Duff spot. 
[01:37:00]  Yeah, the PSA, which is just, they're getting so politically correct these days.  And I can't even watch college students and people that are so involved in things, yet  there hasn't been this life experience yet.  So, and I don't care if I'm sounding like, you know, my dad or something at this point,  but it's just this phony, like, as long as the words, as long as it's worded right, 
[01:37:30]  don't hurt anyone with your words.  Don't say that.  It's talking about saying, calling something's gay.  It's like, hey, you know, don't be gay.  That's gay.  Stop being gay.  And it puts a negative connotation on the word gay.  What?  It's just, it's, whenever you use that word, were you using it as a slur against gay people?  No, there are plenty of other ones to use. 
[01:38:00]  There were plenty on the playground that we used, aside from gay.  Why use the one they use?  Why use gay when there's better words?  Of course.  Accomplish the same thing.  Yes, it's not like gay is the word you use for gay people.  They're gay people.  We've talked to gay guys on the phone, and they say, we say it the same way.  Call each other queer, things like that.  But, I mean.  Why is queer acceptable?  That would sound like it would be.  Queer is a little off.  It's always been a little off.  Yeah, but that sounds worse than the F word for gay. 
[01:38:30]  It's like, what's the C word for gay?  What is like, oh, oh.  Oh, Carlisi.  There's a lot going on with that statement.  The C word for gay.  Oh, God damn.  Carlisi.  Everyone had the two word combo.  Yeah, yeah, that was the two word combo, definitely.  Like, here's the Hilary Duff PSA about.  Just listen to this. 
[01:39:00]  This is garbage.  This is nauseating.  They're so out of talk.  She walks in to a dress store, I guess, and there's two little chicks, and they're trying  on clothes.  Yeah.  And one of them comments on the other one's clothing that she doesn't like it, so she  says, you know, it's gay.  And Hilary comes in to straighten their asses out.  Oh, good for her.  Yes.  Yeah.  Do you like this top?  It's so gay.  Really?  Yeah, it's totally gay.  You know, you really shouldn't say that. 
[01:39:30]  Say what?  Well, say that something's gay when you mean it's bad.  It's insulting.  What if every time something was bad, everybody said, oh, that's so girl wearing a skirt as  a top.  Oh, you are.  Those are cute jeans, though.  When you say that's so gay, do you realize what you say?  Knock it off.  Knock it off.  We're never going to be part of society.  No, we're done.  We're doing.  There's someone out there saying, this is really good and we need to do this. 
[01:40:00]  Yeah.  And convinced her to do this.  It's more thought policing.  Thought police.  It's amazing.  More completely out of whack, trying to just force people to think a certain way.  It's so...  You don't understand the resentment you breed.  People don't want to hear anything you have to say when you take yourself that seriously.  When people would want to go out, you call a friend, you're going, hey, you know, hang  out at the bar.  Nah, I'm going to hang in tonight.  Don't be gay.  Come on out.  You're being gay.  I'm not thinking, I love when I speak my hate speech like this. 
[01:40:30]  I'm going to speak some hate speech to my friends and call them gay.  You just, it's a word you used.  Words have a couple of meanings.  To put it that way, there are plenty of words that have more than one meaning to it.  Gay is one of them.  Gay means you're gay, but it could also mean don't be.  You know, don't be a fuddy-duddy.  Don't be a fuddy-duddy.  What's wrong with you? 
[01:41:00]  You're absolutely right, though.  Yeah.  God, that's so true.  It's a fuddy-duddy.  Absolutely right.  I'm sure they dumped on this side of the show, but when you use that word, you don't  mean the C.  Yeah, Louis C.K. does a bit on that, about the word faggot and the different uses.  For that, and how it doesn't have anything to do with gay.  It's just, you know, we've taken some words, and they have dual meanings. 
[01:41:30]  Yeah.  And that's the only thing.  It's not hate speech.  It's not inciting anyone.  It doesn't make anyone, you know, want to go gay bashing.  And I think someone like Hilary Duff is probably out of touch with the gay community.  You probably, like, talk to the, you know, the gays, and this is not something they care  too much about, right?  There's a common...  They want to get married and other things.  They don't give a crap about language.  There's a common usage for words like gay, or even don't be a fag when they know you're  not gay bashing. 
[01:42:00]  It's like the word pimped.  Like, we all know a pimp is a guy who takes young runaways, forces them into prostitution.  It's a brutal guy.  Yeah.  And demands money, and a pimp is a guy who is a horrible guy.  But the common use in society is, pimp my ride.  Yeah.  Or, oh man, he pimped him out.  Nobody thinks...  Yeah, that guy's pimp.  You know, you're a pimp.  Nobody thinks that it means what the original meaning is. 
[01:42:30]  Just like when you go, oh, don't be gay.  Nobody thinks, don't be a homosexual.  That's against...  No one takes it that literally with the common usage.  Everybody knows that.  And take it way back to what it meant happy.  There you go.  The gays ruined it.  The thought police are just taking all the fun out of life.  They're disgusting.  It's like, stop overthinking every single word in this society.  Hey, there's another thing that went on in that PSA.  Yeah, thank you, Chester's Liver.  It passed us.  Could they have thought of a better line than girl wearing a skirt for a top, too? 
[01:43:00]  Oh, awful.  Well, if you watch the spot, there's this girl, and she's got a top on,  and you don't really notice it looks like a skirt, that she's wearing a skirt for a top.  But then after Hillary fills us in, you realize she is.  But I didn't notice or care.  I just thought, wow, how can I get these girls in my jacuzzi?  But she was saying that, like, that would be a bad thing to start.  Yeah.  I didn't really understand that. 
[01:43:30]  It didn't make much sense, even in the...  See, there's the spot.  Look, a young Asian girl.  Oh, of course.  A little white girl.  And then Hillary Duff comes in and straightens them out.  I don't care if the girl's wearing a skirt for a top.  Oh, whatever.  Pull that thing up.  Get her over a windy subway grate.  Yeah.  Blows up on her and...  Yeah.  Let's go to John.  John, how are you?  Hello, boys.  How are you doing?  Knock it off.  Oh, the PSA is up on onaradio.com.  Great.  There you go.  Watch it and vomit.  Yeah, John. 
[01:44:00]  I want to know where you found a hole in training video.  Yeah.  Knock it off.  Guys.  Later, boys.  People have not...  This is what annoys me about what's happening.  It's like people have forgotten what's the difference between hate speech and common usages with certain words.  And they can't differentiate between true hate speech and things you said in humor or sarcasm.  And it's like this self-righteous little movement by a bunch of hypersensitive little bitches. 
[01:44:30]  Yeah.  It doesn't make any sense.  You're not...  Yeah, they classify everything as hate speech now, no matter what the context is.  No matter what the context, it's hate speech.  Because that's how they get you not to say it.  Yeah.  You can't just say, don't say that.  I don't like to hear it.  It's objectionable to me.  I don't like it.  So you shouldn't say that.  That's too self-righteous.  Yeah.  So they have to put a...  Like the church would say, well, that's family values.  You shouldn't talk that way.  Yeah.  And the liberals would go, hate speech.  Everyone's got a reason why you shouldn't say things. 
[01:45:00]  It's so gay.  I'm so sorry.  The whole thing is just gay.  Don't use that word.  Don't use that word.  Oh, I'm sorry.  It's so Steve C.  Yes.  I know I'm gay.  We got the first minute of the fake Sarah Palin porno?  Yeah.  It's called Nailin Palin.  Nailin Palin.  Yeah.  It's Hustler's putting it out.  It's just...  I mean, it's like...  It's intentionally terrible.  Okay.  It's terrible.  And this is the first minute of it. 
[01:45:30]  They found sort of a lookalike?  Yeah.  She looks pretty like her.  Yeah.  I'll pull it up for you.  Tina Fey.  Yeah.  Jeepers, crumpets.  Who could that be?  ÐŸÑ€Ð¸Ð²ÐµÑ‚.  We hate to trouble you, but I'm afraid we have a flat tire.  We were wondering if we could use your phone to call the Kremlin.  Oh, I'm sorry, fellas.  I don't speak Russian. 
[01:46:00]  Kremlin.  It means...  How do you say?  Toad truck.  Well, in the spirit of foreign relations, I'm sure there's no harm in me letting the two of you in.  Come on.  The phone is right there.  Can I offer you boys a drink?  No, thanks.  We are already pretty drunk.  But you need to make a call.  You know, if I could rearrange the alphabet, I would put you and I together. 
[01:46:30]  If I didn't know any better, I'd think you boys were flirting with me.  Excuse me.  But I think I dropped something.  It's my jaw.  Well, the actress, quote, looks a lot like Sarah Palin with huge bosoms.  This is such horrible dialogue.  I like it.  Yeah, she does look like her.  She could have ridden her hair up a bit.  The lookalike.  Yeah, the lookalike is right there. 
[01:47:00]  This could be good.  They actually could have made this really hot.  Yeah.  Like, you could have really seen Dirty Sarah.  Russian soldiers coming.  Oh, because Alaska.  Okay, I get it.  Yeah, well.  I don't know why they went over the top.  I wasn't thinking geographical content there.  The dialogue was great, though.  Kremlin means Dothrak.  Yes, I need you to call Kremlin.  Why don't it?  It means Dothrak.  It doesn't.  All right, we're going to take a break. 
[01:47:30]  We'll put the trailer up on onaradio.com, I guess.  And don't forget Bobby's in Boston.  Yeah, Wilbur Theater, Bobby.  It's Friday night.  Yes, and I will not be doing any interviews with famous people.  That was funny.  Ugh, that was funny.  Then I'll follow you for the rest of your career.  Believe me, I'm still living down foot thing on my foot.  You'll be living down the Lance Reddick interview.  Dude, there's a cow.  They hook it up.  But the credits roll.  Oh, Jesus.  And see, you ruined it, too, because when you said that the woman was hooked up to a cow,  I was going to go, so how is it being hooked up to the woman? 
[01:48:00]  But I ruined it.  You ruined it by losing weight.  Yeah.  Bastard.  Like one of the fans said this weekend, you'll be back.  Yeah.  Wow.  There seems to be a girl, if you're on Pal Talk, this girl, Olga.  Where's the bitch?  Seems to be on there.  What is Olga doing today?  Well, she's having fun with a toy.  Is she one of ours?  And, no, she's new.  Maybe she was Russian with the Olga.  She's having fun with a toy. 
[01:48:30]  And she's kind of, like, doing what people that are fighting do with their hands.  You know when you do that?  Yeah.  She looks like a magician trying to pull a scarf out of two holes in one.  Oh, you got it?  It's up?  It looks like she's trying out for you, Ant.  Is this an audition?  I think she's auditioning for a spot at Chateau Cumia.  Wow.  Well, she's doing something there that might taint the jacuzzi water. 
[01:49:00]  Yeah.  Wow.  Wait, is she on Pal Talk or is she on a porno?  No, I think she's on.  Is she?  She's not listening to us right now.  I don't think she's listening or understanding.  Is she one of ours?  Oh, my God.  What are you doing?  That doesn't go there after you do what you did.  No, that's not there to there.  That's A.T.F.  The other thing.  Oh, no.  No, that.  See, no, that thing wasn't there.  Oh, that little switcheroo.  The thing that people fighting use to hurt each other.  Yeah.  That was there. 
[01:49:30]  Okay.  But that thing was somewhere else.  Oh, all right.  Yeah.  Do we know if she's one of ours?  She's not.  No, she's Olga.  She's got to be from Russia.  She is a Russian girl.  She has hairy armpits.  She is Russian.  No, but I think she's got.  Yeah, look.  See, that's a section scar.  Wait, what's going on down there?  Wow.  Is there a, yeah.  How could you not see that?  There's a little.  Oh, well, yeah.  Oh, look at her.  Is that a double oven in the background?  She's bombing.  What's wrong with you?  I'm going to redo my kitchen. 
[01:50:00]  Wow.  Oh, what's going on with those, right?  Her boobs are horrendous.  They're awful.  Well, they're not bad if you're getting out of a tub in The Shining.  They are hard.  She's kind of bending over forward.  So gravity is doing its work.  And they're very, they look like two bananas.  Yeah.  Yeah, they really do.  She looked like she was in a hole in World War II in Germany.  Oh, boy.  Bob.  Oh, Bob.  Was she hooked up to a cow?  With a... 
[01:50:30]  Isaac.  With a...  For a two, she has a lot of confidence.  Yeah, yeah.  That brings her up to a three.  Yeah, she's got a lot of confidence.  She has seven confidence for a two.  Yeah, well.  All right, well.  But we can't stop looking on her, so she wins.  No, because, yeah, she wins.  She completely stopped the show with what she's doing on camera.  The pal talk room is rocking today.  Well, we'll take a break here.  All righty.  Robert Kelly, Wilbur Theater, Friday night.  Get your tickets now.  Ticketmaster.  You're going to be loving Bobby on that stage. 
[01:51:00]  Yes, Jimmy.  We don't have anybody...  Do we have anybody coming over to SiriusXM?  No.  That's tomorrow.  Okay.  Who's tomorrow?  I don't know.  I thought we had one person here.  All right.  We're going to check out the F.U. line as we go to break.  Thanks for calling the Opie and Anthony F.U. line.  Here's the latest batch of F.U.s.  You have six new voice messages.  First voice message.  Yeah, I want to give a big f*** you to my fat f*** boss, Frank.  You're a fat f***.

Yeah, I just want to give a big F.U. to Joe the Plumber.  Joe, f*** you.  Nobody gives a s*** about you.  Next message.  I just want to leave a big F.U. to my ex-girlfriend.

Call the Opie and Anthony F.U. line.  866-FU-LINE-1.  That's 866-FU-LINE-1. 
[01:52:30]  Thank you and goodbye.  Opie and Anthony.  Author Jim Norton.  Stand-up comic Robert Kelly.  Who's in hit movies.  Jim Norton.  I'll look at the list, sir.  No, sir, I don't see Jim Norton, sir.  Think of comedy.  When the author couldn't get into the Jerry show that night because he wasn't on the list. 
[01:53:00]  He's at the back door and the security guard.  I'll check the list again, sir.  No, sir, your name is not here, sir.  Yeah.  That was the author that got bumped.  That guy wasn't even an actor.  It was just a security guard.  They threw him a bone, and it was the worst acting in the movie.  His eyes were all googly-eyed because he didn't know where to look.  Yeah.  I love that in movies.  Yeah, Robert Kelly.  Wilbur Theater.  This Friday night. 
[01:53:30]  I'm a busy man.  I would fly up to Boston in a second.  I haven't been up there in a while to see you, Bobby.  Oh, cool.  I'm excited.  The Wilbur Theater.  I hope it's good.  I got to sell it.  I think I have five tickets sold now.  Well, if you had two, now you have five.  Yeah, there we go.  Percentage-wise.  It's a 1,200 seat.  That's a 150% increase.  It's a recession.  Hey, you know, Obama.  Enough said.  Well, he's doing what every other politician does. 
[01:54:00]  You know you got the Phillies and the Rays in the World Series.  The Phillies and that minor league team.  Oh, well, who's he decisively picking so as to just show that he can actually pick a sports  team, not worry about it affecting his campaign.  I just want one politician to do it the right way.  Be honest.  Obama says he's rooting for the Phillies, but also says he supports the Rays.  In his defense, though, they interviewed him about the White Sox and the club, the Cubs.  You just messed me up because you went, shut up, the Cubs. 
[01:54:30]  And he said there's only one real team in Chicago.  It's the White Sox.  I mean, he totally bashed the Cubs.  So he really is a White Sox fan.  Yeah, but he doesn't really need Illinois or he doesn't need Chicago anymore in general.  No.  The problem here, he's in a tough spot because Pennsylvania and Florida, they're swing states.  Yes.  He's very worried, so he doesn't want to.  Just make a decision.  You know you want the Phillies.  No one wants the Rays. 
[01:55:00]  Half of Tampa doesn't care.  Yeah.  Stupid Red Sox.  I can't take that, Obama.  And I know he's going to goddamn win this thing.  And it's just annoying the crap out of me.  I hate it.  The Republicans did not put a very impressive ticket forth.  No.  I just got my copy of my NRA magazine.  And they just have a whole laundry list of things that both Biden and Obama have voted on and against as far as the Second Amendment goes. 
[01:55:30]  And it's just it is he is completely for just taking away every single gun that everybody has.  He wants his country just to not have a Second Amendment.  What about paintball guns?  Can you have those?  Believe me, they'll probably go after those, too.  It's just it's insane.  He doesn't want any concealed carry.  Yeah.  They don't they don't have you're not allowed to own a gun in Chicago.  Boy, that's your cut down on the crime, huh?  Boy, that's sure it works, doesn't it?  When you take the guns away from the law abiding citizens. 
[01:56:00]  So only the thugs have them, you dummy, you dumb son of a bitch.  Oh, just disgusts me.  And it was all these things that they had voted on on putting a five hundred percent increase on taxes on on guns so that, you know, it's it's it's your right to own it.  That is saying that the states and local governments absolutely have the the ability and the right to to make up whatever decisions they want about gun ownership, which it's part of your constitutional right. 
[01:56:30]  More gun deaths in Chicago than Iraq.  OK, how about that?  It's it's it's ludicrous to think that that works.  But this dummy just wants to.  How about this?  You shoot someone in self-defense in your own home with a legal handgun that he wants to be able to prosecute you. 
[01:57:00]  These are things that are just that he voted on these things.  Him and Biden.  Biden says he's the one that he authored the assault weapons ban.  And assault weapon is semantics.  It has nothing.  Any gun can be considered as a solid.  People think you're whipping in with a machine gun.  It's a semi-automatic gun.  Does it look cool?  Yeah.  OK, it does.  It doesn't look like your pops hunting rifle.  It looks like, you know, an AR-15 is is the civilian version of an M16 of what they use in combat with the American troops are using. 
[01:57:30]  But it amounts to a semi-automatic rifle.  It's not a machine gun.  But when you say assault weapon, morons who don't know what it means say, oh, that must be a machine gun that can just mow people down.  Do the same damage with your dad's hunting rifle, the semi-automatic.  It's just so ridiculous.  I hate the fact that he's just trying to completely strip this country of the Second Amendment. 
[01:58:00]  It already has been in a lot of places.  There's places that you can't get a gun.  How is that possible that there are places in the United States where the Second Amendment says that you have the right to bear arms where you don't have the right to bear arms?  Where?  Chicago, for one.  New York City is another place where they let the local government decide that you're not going to be able to, you know, get a gun.  Oh, they say you can, but, you know, not going to be able to.  There are some things that don't bother me as much that really bother NRA people. 
[01:58:30]  Like, they're for everything.  Like, if you have to register your guns, I'm all for that.  I'm all for FBI checks.  There are some people that are like, no, goddamn, why should I have to go do an FBI check?  It's like, no, I like that.  It's easy to stay in age.  You go run through an FBI check.  Felons, convicted felons.  Shouldn't have handguns.  Fine.  The NRA is for all.  That's why the NRA stinks.  No, that's why they're a balance for the other people that stink.  See, I realize that both sides are so off balance that somewhere in the middle is where, you know, the balance happens. 
[01:59:00]  But if one side gets a little too much power, then you're screwed.  And in this case, Obama and Biden just want to take away.  I have the exact same gun as that, the top one.  And it's so much fun to shoot.  You go down to the range and just blast at 250 yards. 
[01:59:30]  When you hit your mark at 250 yards, it's so cool.  It's fun.  But why would you need a gun like that to shoot deer, Anthony?  I'm not hunting.  I don't hunt.  I don't like killing things with my guns.  To tell you the truth, I'm not a hunter.  I just love that angle, though, because I'm not a gun guy.  But I would assume if you are a hunter, you could absolutely hunt with that, though.  But you would want to do as much damage as possible.  You're already out there wanting to kill something.  So you want to really just...  If you're a real hunter, let me tell you something.  That thing is set up for hunting. 
[02:00:00]  It's got a great scope on it, a little bipod if you want to get down in the prone position.  But it's not like you're going to rattle off a whole magazine at this deer that's walking by.  You have to be a good hunter.  You go for the kill shot.  But I don't think you have to be a good hunter.  That's what I'm getting at.  I mean, there's guys out there, they want to just like...  Dude, if you're riddling a deer with bullets, you should be like drummed out of the friggin' hunting business.  Really?  Your friends will make fun of you.  The whole thing about hunting is stalking, concealment, camouflage, and getting one shot, one kill. 
[02:00:30]  You know, it's the famous deer hunter thing.  Yeah, it is.  There's a famous sniper line, not a deer hunting line.  It's from the deer hunter, I said.  Yeah, but it's from snipers.  Yeah, but it was from the movie The Deer Hunter.  I thought you said deer hunting.  No, deer hunting.  Yeah, the deer, one shot, one kill.  No, you can take another shot.  Yeah, and you don't want to ruin the meat by riddling the thing and having to bleed all over your venison. 
[02:01:00]  But again, I don't hunt.  I like shooting.  People don't understand that shooting is fun.  It's fun to do.  It's a skill-based thing.  It's like darts, only further away with power behind it.  It's darts that go bang.  It's a Richard Redneck sport?  No, it's just fun.  When you go down to the range, it's not real rednecks down there.  It's people that, it's a very good test of skill.  If you can hit your mark at 250, 300 yards like that, it's very fulfilling. 
[02:01:30]  Do they give you like a trophy or a plaque?  They don't give you crap.  You get to go and go like, that's pretty goddamn cool.  I've never heard it put that way, the dart analogy.  I like that.  Yeah.  But it's also fun to hit the wall behind the target.  Let's be honest.  I saw you at Green Acres back in the day where you would play darts where you guys came up with...  Oh, we'd throw them into these wall outlets, the sockets on the wall?  Well, the dart board gets boring after a while, so it's like, all right, let's go for the... 
[02:02:00]  I also don't usually go shooting after shots of JÃ¤germeister and beer.  That's something I don't do.  Hey, we got a call coming in from Detroit, and we all know it's cold in the day.  It's got to be cold in the day.  Let's say hi to Todd in Detroit.  Todd.  Yes, boys, it's very cold in the day.  Jimmy, you rule.  Thank you.  Hopey, anytime you want to go out drinking.  Anthony, you elitist, fancy man, little douchebag.  All right. 
[02:02:30]  What'd I do?  Only certain people should have guns, such as guys who have big mansions.  So I take it, everybody that's ever been convicted of a felony, who couldn't afford a decent legal defense,  truly committed to the crime, is that it?  So then those people shouldn't be allowed to vote, therefore those people shouldn't be allowed to have guns.  Therefore, the 51% can enslave the 49%.  You sit there and espouse about how great the Constitution of the United States is. 
[02:03:00]  Yes.  Yeah, it is a great document.  Absolutely.  Life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.  But when we get away from being a constitutional limited republic into a democracy where 51% can enslave 49%, i.e. felons,  you know, go ahead, man.  Absolutely.  Stoppile and just wait for the VATF to show up and take them away.  See you.  So you're, um, no, dude, I might have agreed with you.  I think you might have converted me.  He said 51-49 too many times.  Yeah, I know. 
[02:03:30]  All right, it made me sick.  But, uh, okay.  All right, give them to the felons, too.  He changed my mind.  And the date.  Thanks for the call from, uh, Detroit, yes.  Yeah, got that one, too.  And yes, only certain people should be able to own guns.  People who haven't been convicted of certain crimes.  I think as a society, we have the right, could we all start out as non-felons?  Yes.  So if you don't commit felonies, you can do that.  Yeah.  I think as a fair, I think as a society, we have the right to go, eh, felons, no.  I only, I have one problem with, uh, your thought there, Jimmy. 
[02:04:00]  You said society, uh, way too normal.  Oh.  I think as a society, we should be able to not look for escaped goats.  You think we're all zombie killers.  You're on sick society.  I love that.  She's a girl, Abigail.  Now we think she's been giving a codeine overdose.  Almighty. 
[02:04:30]  It's the slowest murder ever committed.  She's being filtered St. Joseph's children's aspirin.  I have a members-only jacket.  I bought it with the president of Iran.  We shopped together.  We're just your lousy scapegoats.  You're the killers.  You're a whole sick society.  That's who's guilty, man.  That's right.  Meh.  Meh, meh.  Ah, nice.  Hey, uh, Dolomite.  Rudy Ray Moore, man.  Yeah, he's dead at the age of 81. 
[02:05:00]  I got a picture with him at a Comic-Con, and he smelled like urine.  Oh.  He did.  He really did.  Come on.  Well, the guy's dead.  It was probably urine.  He's still a funny guy, man.  I tried to be a good guy once at the movie theater, and went to this old bag, was in  a wheelchair, and apparently the movie had ended, and her friend who was with her had gone to  the bathroom, and the movie ended.  And there were two old bags, so this old fossil is sitting there.  You know how it's kind of a ramp going up when you leave the movie theater? 
[02:05:30]  So she couldn't quite roll herself.  So I was like, oh, I'll, you know, I'll push you up the ramp.  So I grabbed the handles and started pushing, and now realize where I'm standing, and my  nose is directly above the back of her seat.  Dude, she just didn't care about going to the bathroom.  She didn't have to, you know, leave to do everything.  She's old.  So I'm pushing up just going, this is why I don't do this.  Why did I feel like I should do this and help? 
[02:06:00]  Because now it's just, ugh, you disgusting bird.  Because it's nice, Anthony.  No, you know something?  Not for me.  Not the waft I got.  It's not like Jimmy's microphone after he gets done tooting into it.  Toot.  Farting.  Yes.  Yeah, but think of the position she's in.  She's got to wait for someone to, you know, push her.  She should have sat there in her own, you know, whatever it was.  That's why they made DVD players.  I don't know why I was being nice.  She might have had a bag, dude.  It might not have been her fault.  No, it had to be her bag.  It had to be a diaper. 
[02:06:30]  It had to be a diaper.  Because it was right where, you know, if you hold on to those handles and start rolling,  it's right where.  What did it smell like?  It smelled like a waste product.  All kinds.  Everything?  Everything.  A medley.  Yes, medley.  Like short ribs?  It didn't smell like Sprite and Tootsie Rolls.  But it may have looked like it.  Smell like a dirty puddle.  It was so nasty and pungent.  Poor Rudy. 
[02:07:00]  And I'm just like, ugh, you.  Hey, you had a really good rant there, and I just want to let the people out there know  some of the opinions coming in.  I agree with Anthony.  Shooting guns is like driving a golf ball, because we're not going to be able to get to all these  calls right now.  Wants to argue Jim on NRA.  Shooting is an Olympic event.  Just bought my weapons license.  I want to defend Anthony.  So it's one of those situations where I would say, if you are an NRA member, vote accordingly.  If not, join.  And I'd say start buying what you want now. 
[02:07:30]  Because usually you get grandfathered in on these things.  They pass a law.  But whoever owns it, it's okay.  You just can't buy any new ones.  So load up.  Stockpile.  Stockpile.  They want to cut back on all kinds of ammunition that they deem.  They deem them armor-piercing at times.  It's just regular hunting ammo that they say is armor-piercing ammo.  They put these in these classifications that are just not true. 
[02:08:00]  They have little catchphrases that scare people and make them think that legal gun owners  are nuts, that are nutty and doing all this killing and shooting at cop's Kevlar jacket.  No.  Those people will always have guns.  It's the citizens that are put in danger when they put all these restrictions on people  being able to have their American right to protect themselves, for God's sake.  How many, what's there to argue with the NRA? 
[02:08:30]  It's like they're a special interest group.  They are.  Like every other special interest group.  Like the guy wants to argue.  I'm sure they serve a purpose and there's a need for them.  But they, like every other special interest group, way overextend and become obsessed  and go so far in one direction, they lose me.  I think what they're doing is trying their damnedest to protect your Second Amendment right.  How hard is it to get done?  It, it, in New York, like for me, if I wanted to buy a handgun, how hard would it be? 
[02:09:00]  You ain't getting one for at least, if you started today to try to get your license,  six months just to get your license.  Yeah.  Really?  And then you might not get it anyway.  Can I go to another state and get it?  Uh, no.  Then you can't bring it into New York.  There are some states that have reciprocating license where you can go back and forth.  But New York doesn't.  With New York, New York, you can go to a few states.  Florida's got a license where you can add a state.  Like, I could get a Florida pistol license, and it's good in 29 other states, but not New York. 
[02:09:30]  So even though I don't live there, and I'm actually looking into this so I could carry in any other state I go to.  Because I can't drive into, I can't drive into, like, any other state.  I have a license, it's an American right.  It's the American Constitution, but I can't take my pistol that I have licensed, that I took all the,  I went through everything that had to be done to go from New York, and I can't drive into Jersey.  I can't drive into Connecticut.  I can't, you're not allowed.  You can't drive into Manhattan.  I can't drive into Manhattan with the thing. 
[02:10:00]  I can't go to Queens.  Isn't there a special license?  I need a different license to go into New York City than you do for New York State.  How the hell did they swing that one?  Who didn't stand up and say, excuse me, this is completely against the Second Amendment?  Unbelievable.  It makes me sick the way that one's been really twisted around out of nothing but fear.  They just scare people.  How many, let me ask you this, and I know, I don't know what, I honestly don't know what the numbers are,  but how many, like a lot of these guys that snap and kill people at work, or how many of them are done? 
[02:10:30]  And I know that's the exception.  Oh, I know.  No, no, absolutely.  You will absolutely find people that are registered handgun owners, that have lived a perfectly good life,  never did anything, that go into their workplace and blow their boss's brains out, or shoot their wife, or whatever.  It's going to happen.  It's going to happen with a knife.  It's going to happen with anything else.  It's easier with a gun, I'll be honest, sure.  But that is the exception.  That isn't what's happening. 
[02:11:00]  In most cases, it's somebody with an unregistered illegal handgun committing a crime against an unarmed citizen.  That's what happens.  Can't you just get a taser and carry that around?  You're not allowed.  You can't carry a taser.  A lot of places, you can't carry pepper spray.  You get caught with pepper spray in New York City, see what happens.  You get caught with a taser in the city, see what happens.  They don't want you to have the ability to protect yourself for some goddamn reason. 
[02:11:30]  Although it's rare, and a lot of the listeners were against me on this one, but that jerk-off in Texas,  who stayed on the phone for 25 minutes and then went out and shot those two guys because he had a gun and he wanted to use it.  I'm protecting my neighbor's property.  Shut your mouth.  Well, you know what?  Those two idiots that were breaking into the neighbor's house, screw them.  They're roaches.  I'm not saying they're not â€“ it's not about them.  We know what they are.  And the fact that they got killed, nobody loses anything.  They're crap.  They really are. 
[02:12:00]  I'm just glad.  They were â€“ good.  Armed citizen took care of two â€“ I was going to use the word we can't use.  That's not a scum.  Oh, that one got passed now?  Yeah.  As long as it's used in a proper context?  Yeah.  Well, they are.  And I'm glad they're off the face of the earth because eventually they probably would have just killed somebody.  So screw it.  The guy sounded like an idiot.  He should have just stayed in his house perhaps.  Wait a minute.  I don't know.  But I have no â€“ I don't care that they got killed.  You don't think the guy should have shot the two people? 
[02:12:30]  I know he shouldn't have.  Texas is like the Wild West.  Because he went out in his front yard and they were taken off.  He was in no danger and he knew it.  But he even said, I'll kill him.  If you hear the whole call, he was on the phone for a long time.  I mean, if they were coming into his house and he shot them both dead, good.  But it was a neighbor's house.  His argument was when he went outside, they started approaching him.  They were cutting across his property when he shot them.  He didn't shoot them in the other guy's yard. 
[02:13:00]  They had cut across his property when they were fleeing the house.  And he blasted them.  Fine by me.  He was in no danger.  He knew he was in no danger.  Now, had he just seen that happening, they're breaking in and he runs out with his gun and  then they come, I would have a lot more empathy for him.  All right, maybe he just panicked.  He was an eager beaver, wasn't he?  But he wanted to do it.  Like, we heard the call.  He wanted to be a part of stopping these guys and they were committing a â€“ look, a 
[02:13:30]  burglary.  Yeah.  He saw an opportunity.  Yeah, exactly.  Yeah, but if those guys who put a burglary, it winds up to be a murder.  Sometimes it does.  You're right.  You don't know at that moment.  And Texas laws are a hell of a lot different, man.  They allow you the â€“ you could use deadly force in a lot more circumstances in Texas  than you can in a lot of other states.  You can just go buy a gun in Texas, right?  Yeah.  Yeah.  You can just go in Walmart, give me that.  I'll take that one.  And you can wear a gun in Texas, too. 
[02:14:00]  You just â€“ which is weird.  I don't think you can conceal in Texas.  You have to wear it exposed.  It's bizarre.  I went down to Dallas.  We've said this a couple times to see Jimmy perform.  Have you done Dallas yet?  Yeah.  Yeah, I've done a lot.  There are so many â€“ we did a gig with Pugs and Kelly.  They were doing a bar gig, and half the people had guns in the bar.  It was insane.  God, what a â€“  You can wear it out.  Paradise.  Yeah, and women have â€“ all the women were talking about their guns, and most of them  left them in the glove compartments in the cars because they don't look as â€“ it 
[02:14:30]  takes away from their hot outfits, I guess, or something, so they leave them in the glove  compartments.  The women were â€“  I had a girl with a gun.  The women all had them.  That's great.  She stuck it in my mouth.  Really?  Yeah, I made a â€“ I made a, like, arrest me.  Some people dig that.  That's crazy.  I made a â€“ she was a cop.  Oh, really?  Yeah, in the middle of, like, Michigan somewhere, and I made her arrest me and cock it, stick  it in my mouth, and tell me I was a bad boy.  They should have a federal license.  Now, I don't â€“ you know, if you want to take a safety test, you want, obviously, the 
[02:15:00]  FBI background checks and everything, but there should absolutely be a federal license to  carry in all 50 states of the country whose constitution says that you have this right.  Why don't you just become an FBI agent so you can do that?  Man, I'm too old.  Me not.  I get paid too well doing this.  Oh.  Let's get out of here.  Bobby Kelly, Friday night.  Friday night, Wilbur Theater.  Wilbur Theater in Boston.  Yeah, come on, peeps.  Yeah, come out.  Go check out Robert Kelly up there in Boston. 
[02:15:30]  Yeah, ticketmaster.com this Friday.  And tonight, Fringe is on at 9 o'clock.  It's a massive hit for Fox.  I want to get caught up because it's on all season.  I don't know if we did that show justice, but it was still fun hanging with Lance Reddick.  Yeah, yeah.  He was fine.  It was a great show.  It was very cool, and everybody knows.  The phones were ringing, so people know it's a great show.  Yeah, if you like Lost, you'll like this show.  Let's pre-order Jimmy's book, I Hate Your Guts.  Yes.  It's on Amazon.com pre-order.  It's actually cheaper to pre-order it.  For the next two weeks, you can get it, and I think the fans will dig this one. 
[02:16:00]  I really do.  Now, the day it comes out.  Are you doing a book signing that day?  I'm doing one the night before at Borders here in New York.  It's election day it comes out, which I'm doing Jersey.  Oh, I got a real quick.  I'm very embarrassed, by the way.  Toucher and Rich, who are guys that have been very cool to me, and they're friends of ours,  in the thank yous, they are not listed in the thank yous.  Oh, that's not good.  But, if I forgot, I would be very honest.  I didn't forget.  It was a copy editor mistake, because there's like four or five people that got left out. 
[02:16:30]  There was a few changes that went through, and they were one.  My friend Mandy here, who has helped me get a lot of press in New York, was one.  So, there's a few people that got left out, but it was not an oversight.  I'd tell you if I forgot.  Take care of that in the second printing.  It's already been done.  So, the second printing, Touch and Rich will see their name in the book.  I was so irritated, and it was too late to go back and do it.  There was something on the front jacket I wanted to correct, too, and they didn't do that.  So, my apologies to Touch and Rich.  That was not an oversight, but it's just embarrassing, because unlike a lot of other shows, we actually know those guys pretty well. 
[02:17:00]  Yeah.  And it's just kind of irritating what happened.  We don't know them when they're sober, but we do know them.  Too drunk to read.  They never are.  Yeah, they don't even realize they're not in the book.  They'll think their name's in there.  Yeah, I'll give them a copy, or they'll just start eating it.  Savages.  Give them a copy where their name is just penciled in.  They'll think that's how you did it.  They won't know.  Look at this guy's toilet paper with my picture on it.  For everybody in Boston, check out Touch and Rich later on today on BCN.  All right, we're out.  We'll see you guys tomorrow.  Thank you.  Bye. 
[02:17:30]  Well, Anthony went off on a tangent, which was good.  Oh.  The whole gun thing gets the people a-talking, I'll tell you.  It certainly does.  That's just my opinion.  We were in the middle of talking about Dolomite, and I don't know this guy.  Black, how do they say that word?  Black exploitation.  Black exploitation, right.  Rudy Ray Moore.  Is dead at the age of 81, and the funeral won't be attended by his mother. 
[02:18:00]  What?  It will be or won't be?  It will be.  So she's anywhere from 95 to 100, I would say, tops.  That's old.  Yeah.  And he was the biggie in that?  He was legendary, man.  He did a lot of the black exploitation, and he was a stand-up comedian.  So, I mean, Dolomite in the mid-70s, early 70s, man.  Rudy Ray Moore was a fucking famous guy.  Like a really dirty comedian.  Was he in the soul of ****** Charlie? 
[02:18:30]  I'm wondering.  I think we could have said it today.  Yeah.  Without people being too mad.  They do actually tell you.  That was the name.  It was the N***a Charlie series.  Was he part of that, Jimmy?  I honestly don't know.  Is that a show?  Does anyone know?  Oh, that was like...  It was a movie, yeah.  Wait, was that before you started doing the show?  We did hours on the show.  Oh, my God.  I got a movie poster from it.  Yeah.  Didn't it get you guys suspended a few years ago?  Probably.  I don't think it did.  I don't need to keep track of the suspensions anymore.  Oh, the Homeless Charlie thing?  Who was the guy? 
[02:19:00]  The soul of Homeless Charlie.  He was like the man from the Blaxploitation movies.  Who was N***a Charlie?  I don't know.  Now we have to look it up again.  Wasn't he in Dusk Till Dawn?  Yeah, yeah.  He was the black guy in Dusk Till Dawn.  Why can't I remember?  Hold on.  Somebody will get it for me.  That's Freddy from Jamaica Station.  Or, as we all know him now because of Jimmy, Piss Boy.  Fred Williamson.  Thank you.  Pat from Unaki.  Fred Williamson. 
[02:19:30]  And Fred Williamson's just like killing white people left and right in the Old West.  Can we get some of those movie trailers?  We did that justice during the N.E.W. days.  Yeah, there's actually trailers for these movies.  It used to be around in the 70s.  Yeah, we got to get the soul.  Oh, what do you got?  He's got one cued up.  Oh, okay.  Let's hear it.  Black cowboys roamed the plains.  They couldn't read or write, but they sure could ride and shoot and kill. 
[02:20:00]  They were men with souls.  Men like Nigger Charlie.  Now he rides again in the soul of Nigger Charlie.  This time, Charlie's got an army behind him.  A whole damn army stealing gold, freeing black brothers and out-smarting and out-fighting the entire West.  Nigger Charlie's on the loose again.  And this time, he's got his soul brothers with him.  So, watch out. 
[02:20:30]  You boy.  Nigger Charlie.  Mr. Nigger Charlie.  Mr. Nigger Charlie.  Paramount Pictures presents Rick Williamson and the soul of Nigger Charlie.  In color.  Rated R.  Under 17.  Not admitted without parents.  Nigger Charlie's back.  And you better watch out.  Now it's your egg.  Right down to McClendon Triple.  The King's Center, Tidwell, Thunderbird Drive-In Theater.  Thunderbird Drive-In Theater.  I wonder what year this was, man.  That's probably 70s. 
[02:21:00]  That's like, yeah, 70s.  Okay.  Yeah, that's...  The best part of the trailer is the beginning.  They can't read or write.  All right, but they can shoot.  Like, okay.  Because, you know.  What is this?  Because they're...  Charlie.  Yeah.  So, uh...  Charlie.  We don't know if...  What's his name again?  Rudy Ray Moore.  Dolomite.  We don't know if he was in that movie, but he was part of that whole movie.  Well, Dolomite was like a character, and that was the...  A lot of the movies are very cheaply done and really kind of, you know... 
[02:21:30]  Cheesy?  Yeah.  I mean, he was never the comedian prior was, or obviously any of those guys who were really  socially relevant.  But, I mean, he was just a dirty comedian.  Yeah.  Do you have any of his standards?  I've never heard of him.  I hope we have clips of all, but he's...  Big Berlin motherfucker.  He was like one of those dudes.  Oh, really?  He was funny, yeah.  Let's say hi to Fontaine.  Fontaine.  Hey, boy.  Good morning.  Good morning.  Hey, I'm feeling I'd throw it at you.  There's tons of Dolomite on YouTube.  All kind of clips from movies.  He had this over-the-top delivery.  It just makes you, as a black person, it makes you fucking want to crawl up under a cabinet 
[02:22:00]  or something.  Well, he was a character, I mean, you know.  I'll look him up on YouTube later today.  Are you black?  Thank you, sir.  Let's go to Warren in Baltimore.  Morning more.  Who the fuck is Warren Jerome?  Warren.  I was tweeting, you assholes.  Hi, Warren.  Hey, who is it?  Jimmy?  Yes, sir.  How are you?  Hey, I just want to talk about Dolomite.  Dolomite, he had a series of poems, rather, where he had the biggest penis in the world. 
[02:22:30]  And one particular poem, he saved a captain's wife from a sinking ship.  It kind of was like a ghetto poem.  Dolomite, please save me.  And the captain was crying.  And Dolomite wasn't saving, but he told him if he'd give him his wife, boom, boom, boom, like that.  Sounds like Bob Kelly giving a movie synopsis or a TV show. 
[02:23:00]  Wait, Rudy Ray Moore himself was in the porno?  No, no, it wasn't a porno.  Rudy Ray Moore was a comedian.  Okay, boom, boom, boom.  No, I know that by now, but I lost it somewhere.  You made it sound like he made a porno.  No, no, it was these poems that Rudy Ray Moore would do.  Oh, okay.  It was a poem.  It was a poem.  What years was Dolomite, was Rudy Ray Moore really famous as a comic?  Really early 70s, right?  In the 50s, man.  In the 50s, I was a young kid.  Oh, really?  Seven, eight, nine years old.  My parents would listen to him.  Red Fox, Moms of Maybelline. 
[02:23:30]  Moms of Maybelline, yeah.  He came around that period.  He was raunchy.  I tell you, he was raunchier than Red Fox.  Believe me, this cat was Rudy Ray Moore.  He was funny.  How great was Red Fox?  Man, that stuff holds up, too.  You got to wash your ass.  Yes.  Red Fox was a dirty guy.  Moms of Maybelline, man.  Moms of Maybelline.  I guess you guys have heard of her.  Sure, of course.  Yeah.  Well, Red Fox actually is mentioned in Malcolm X's biography. 
[02:24:00]  Really?  Yeah, he used to work on the train.  He was a dishwasher.  And he worked with fucking Malcolm X on, I think, on one of the trains.  Really?  I'm guessing in the 50s.  Yeah.  So I didn't realize Rudy Ray Moore was around for that long.  Oh, my God.  Oh, yeah.  You know, I mean, it might have been the 40s that he was really, you know, because he was  old when I was like, I mean, I'm 57, which I know I don't pitch out demographic.  Right.  And black.  Yeah.  I love that one.  I love the show.  I love all you guys.  Thank you. 
[02:24:30]  You guys are very funny.  And, you know, you start the day out laughing.  I'm retired.  So...  Oh, thanks, Warren.  Thank you.  Well, Warren, if Rudy Ray Moore is 81, he'd just die.  What year is that?  I mean, he was born in 19...  You got...  We're doing math now.  I know.  Well, a...  Well...  I got a GED, you know what I'm saying?  1928?  Yeah, about there.  78.  What'd you say?  28?  Yeah.  About there.  So 38, 48, 58.  Oh, yeah.  God, in the mid-50s.  He was 30 years old, so okay.  Yeah, he would have been around my parents' age, because that's who I first heard, Rudy 
[02:25:00]  Ray, and Red Fox, and, of course, Miles Mabley was very popular, too, and Richard  was the prior.  Well, these guys were...  That was the Chitlin circuit, right?  Yeah, yeah, more or less.  That's...  You got it.  That during that period, that's who the comedians were, the black comedians that were actually  making any kind of money.  Well, the dirtier comedians, the dirty black comics, like Miles Mabley or Fox or Rudy Ray  Moore, they opened the door for prior because... 
[02:25:30]  Oh, yeah.  Like, Red Fox had a club, I think it was in L.A., after Richard got sick of doing clean  comedy, and he just couldn't...  Because he was a suit-and-tie Sullivan guy, and he fucking...  Yeah, yeah.  Conk his hair back, and he did, like, you stole Cosby shit, and he admitted that years  later, and he hated it, and he just couldn't do it anymore, so he started just doing what  he wanted to do, and he went into the black clubs, and he really took a big career dive  down, because he was getting very famous, he just couldn't do it anymore, and, you know,  he went backwards to...  Backwards.  I think I did see him, backwards.  I think I did see him, like, on Ed Sullivan or some shit, where it was like, this is prior? 
[02:26:00]  Oh, yeah.  What the fuck is that?  I would love to see some clean, uh, prior.  Oh, yeah, you ought to see him.  Maybe we could get one clip of, uh, prior doing clean before he decided to do his own thing.  Dean Martin walked up to him and told him, oh, you remind me of that Bill Cosby kid,  keep it up, and that's what kind of broke him.  That's what he said in the book.  All right.  Well, he wanted...  I know he wanted to be Cosby.  He was very jealous of Cosby.  He thought there was room for only one big black guy, uh, like, as far as the entertainment  force.  And Cosby, you know, you weren't going to touch Cosby with clean...  Right.  Yeah, yeah, yeah. 
[02:26:30]  Yeah, Cosby was the clean guy.  And there was a couple other, um, comedians back then.  Dick Gregory was very popular.  Rich was pretty funny.  I was a god for Cambridge.  God, he played in a couple of movies, um, Cotton Comes to Harlem.  He was kind of heavy fat.  Looked like, um, the guy, um, on television.  Kind of heavy set dude.  The heavy set dude on television.  Yeah, he was, um... 
[02:27:00]  Roseanne's husband.  Could be anybody.  Who's your favorite comic of all time?  Uh, Jim Norton.  No.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, shit.  Good answer.  Anthony Cummier.  Oh, shit.  What's wrong with the comics we got?  We got.  No, I love...  Hey, um...  Warren, who's your favorite button pusher?  Danny.  Come on.  Travis.  Hey, Warren, can you take one for the team? 
[02:27:30]  You say you're a faithful listener?  Yes, I am.  Can you say, uh, Miller?  I've got Miller.  Miller.  I love that one.  God damn.  All right, Warren.  Thank you, Warren.  Thanks a lot, man.  Call anytime, man.  Warren in Baltimore.  Thank you.  I think that's...  Baltimore, with a wire.  I like that.  All right, listen, we got, uh, more, uh, Nigga Charlie drops.  Hmm.  Nice.  Yeah, we'll get into, uh...  And these were in theaters, right?  Like, these were actually trailers.  Oh, hell yeah. 
[02:28:00]  Oh, hell yeah.  Is this, uh...  Did we play the first clip already?  We might have.  Yeah, we did.  We did?  No.  Oh, I think you meant the first...  We did play one.  No, I know, but I got a whole new...  Oh, that's a completely different movie.  Okay, here we go.  They call him boss, boss, nigga.  They rode into a white man's town.  Great music.  Mm-hmm.  Bringing black man's law. 
[02:28:30]  He's black.  He's brutal.  He's boss.  Ray Williamson is Boss Nigger.  They call him boss.  Boss.  Boss, nigga.  Oh, very good.  They call him boss.  Boss, nigga.  Very catchy, right?  The pendulum swinging back the other way.  Dude, we got some great...  They call him gay.  Gay Steve.  We got some great ones today.  Really?  Yes.  Really, really good. 
[02:29:00]  There's one, supposedly, that could be a hit.  All right.  No joke.  Yeah, there's another black...  I can't say the word.  Blacksploitation.  Blacksploitation.  Think of black people, plural blacks, and then...  Blacksploitation.  Yeah, boss...  With an X.  Boss, nigga.  Boss, nigga.  We get to say the other day.  They call him balls.  You guys are enjoying it.  No, it's just...  I like the context that's in these trailers.  It's great.  That song is...  It's going to be in my head all fucking day now.  How's it going?  It was before you ever heard it.  They call him balls. 
[02:29:30]  Balls.  Maybe not all the words.  Maybe just a couple.  Maybe just one on my way home.  If somebody's in my way.  I might like to drive behind your boss.  So silly.  We're secretly hoping you're singing that song as you go to your car today.  Yeah, I'll be walking out.  They call me balls.  Balls.  Balls, nigga.  Next thing you know...  Frap.  Next thing you know...  A wrench over the head from one of the construction workers.  Next thing you know, it's 4th of July and you're hearing...  Yeah.  What kind of music they play around 4th of July. 
[02:30:00]  Some patriotic tunes playing in your...  Nice summer songs.  Just working a lingo longer bit for everybody.  All right, here's another clip from Boss N-Word.  Say it.  No, I don't want to push it too far today.  I just swore on your new deputy.  I made myself the sheriff.  Being called a nigger in public.  Now that's $20 or two days in jail.  Take your filthy black hands off me, nigger.  He just locked up the bank president. 
[02:30:30]  Well, you've all been hunting black folks for so long.  We just want to see what it felt like to hunt white folks.  Part legend, part devil.  All man.  That's just to satisfy your curiosity.  Good morning, gentlemen.  It's my pleasure to tell you that...  Sir, you are interrupting our breakfast.  We never discuss business while we're eating.  Trying to be all classy and shit. 
[02:31:00]  You're interrupting our breakfast.  Quentin Tarantino should remake one of these.  Black exploitation of it.  That's probably what he wanted to do with that.  That whatever he made there.  Yeah.  Whatever.  All right, here's another clip from Boss N.  You say it this time, Bobby.  They call him Boss.  Boss nigger.  I say nigger with a K.  Nick.  Well, I just like the song.  I want that on. 
[02:31:30]  Ray Williamson is Boss Nigger.  Nervio Martin, his deputy.  They call him Boss.  They call him Boss.  Boss nigger.  You're so bad.  They call him Boss.  They call him Boss.  Boss nigger.  How great is this?  We're in the middle of something, but I don't know the details.  I want to say that ahead of time, just in case, you know, whatever. 
[02:32:00]  A TV anchor got attacked.  My first thought was good, but she got attacked in her home.  It might have been like it started to do a disconnect.  Oh, I thought it happened.  I thought.  No.  That's why I said what I said, because when these people are just being scumbags on your  front lawn, like, you know, someone lost a child or something, and these TV anchors  go up to the door trying to get the comment, that's what I was hoping was the circumstances.  No, this was in her house.  She got brutally attacked, and it was with a blunt object, so it might have just been 
[02:32:30]  a fucking sexual assault.  I'm thinking she's alive.  That's why I want to make it perfectly clear what I said before we started discussing that.  What are you laughing at?  What happened?  Yeah, I saw that.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  What happened, Nero?  Enjoy the show.  Let's just say a clip.  Enjoy the show.  A clip finished, and Ope goes, wow, how great is that?  And some eyes opened up and was looking around the office.  Oh, really?  This is a black delivery guy that wasn't enjoying the boss end clips? 
[02:33:00]  Come on.  Those are great.  All right.  We don't know the details of that.  I don't feel like being on Breitbart today, but some of these scumbags, remember the one  where the guy, we did a few of these over the last few years where the anchors got attacked,  the reporters were just being scummy on someone's front lawn.  Yeah, when they're on your lawn and they just won't go, I love when they get their fucking  teeth punched in, shithead fucking vultures with no accountability, they don't care if 
[02:33:30]  they get it wrong, they don't push things equally, they just stink.  Looks like this is a different story, so.  Yeah, this woman just got a fucking attack.  Yeah, that's not cool.  All right.  Hey, so Dolomite.  Yes.  Let's bring it back to Dolomite.  81 years old.  Here is Dolomite introducing himself.  Dolomite is my name and fucking up motherfuckers is my game.  Do we have any stand-up clips of him?  I don't know.  Might be in the last.  Yeah, let's check if we got Rudy Ray more stand-up. 
[02:34:00]  Goddamn!  You dope-headed junkies make me sick!  That's why niggas in the ghetto can't have shit!  Hey, you get me!  Messing with my car.  Penny-headed junkies, that's all you are.  You'll take from your mama, you'll even take the limbs off of a tree.  But I'm gonna kick your ass for messing with me.  Yeah, he was right.  I forgot about the fucking rhyming, yeah.  It was like a motherfucking Nipsey Russell.  Like, you know, Nipsey Russell over the top. 
[02:34:30]  Whitey-hatin' Nipsey Russell.  Damn, look like my women is on time.  Babe, I could show warm you up.  No shit, baby.  I can dig it.  All right, man.  Yeah.  We just played that music in life all the time.  Yeah, I know.  We just walk around.  Boom, ticka-down, ticka-down, ticka-down, ticka-down.  I love that stuff.  Hysterical.  I love the funny part of these clips for me is the awful audio quality. 
[02:35:00]  Like, from one cut to the next.  Yeah.  It's like, it sounds like it's done on home video.  And then it's like, you know, the music which has been mixed.  And it's really funny how the discrepancy in the audio.  Yeah, that was like a trailer.  Like, the movie trailer ones where they just cut off and go to them talking.  And then the music's too loud and comes in at a bad spot.  Either they had the shitty looping back then because they had shitty audio.  Or, you know, a lot of movies went in and did the looping over.  So, remember the old westerns?  Those were, they, they... 
[02:35:30]  Because they couldn't mic them guys?  Yeah, they didn't do anything.  They didn't have a sound in the studio.  Yeah.  Except for that shitty movies.  You could hear the crackling.  A bus going by.  A plane.  Should we start?  I've got an all-girl army that knows what to do.  They'll box his hell and practice Kung Fu.  I put my finger in the ground and turn the whole world around.  You know, you're still the best man that I know in bed. 
[02:36:00]  There you go.  Some dolomite for everybody today.  I wish you had a stand-up.  Rudy Ray Moore is dead at the age of 81.  I just picture Jimmy talking to a girl like that, rhyming.  And go.  That's all you have is a premise?  Yeah, I only have premises today.  Jesus, Bobby.  I'm actually...  Just premise.  Can we take your temperature?  I'm premise Bobby today.  What I do is I throw him at you.  I'm like...  Yeah, yeah.  I'm just a writer for the show.  Could you imagine if Jimmy...  Jimmy, go.  And we're all supposed to run wild with that concept? 
[02:36:30]  Okay, well, if I rhymed, it'd probably go something like this.  Bobby, you want to just come back tomorrow and do a do-over?  You know what happens with this show?  Is that to get up in the morning...  Sucks.  We do it every day.  It blows.  But I was telling Anthony, you try to listen and try to get involved in a conversation.  But when you're really exhausted, you're not used to getting up every day like that,  I literally get lost in your words. 
[02:37:00]  Like I'm just staring at my mouth.  I get lost in your eyes.  Oh, do you?  Oh, thanks.  I get lost in both your assholes.  Oh, where do you get lost, Dan?  I couldn't go to sleep last night either.  I was watching this haunted...  This fucked up shit about Bobby Mackey's place in Kentucky.  Have you heard about that?  I can't watch that haunted house shit before bed.  This guy got scratched.  Scratched.  Like, you know, the guys like...  My back hurts.  They picked up his shirt and there was just three scratch marks on his back.  He got scratched by a demon.  Probably a fucking spring coming through the bed when he was sleeping. 
[02:37:30]  There's no bed.  They're in a basement.  What was he sleeping?  Dude, this Bob Mackey place is one of the hauntedest places in the...  One of the hauntedest.  Who's Bob Mackey?  Not most haunted, just hauntedest.  Hauntedest.  Bobby, who's Bob Mackey?  Who is he?  Bob Mackey's a country singer from Kentucky, but he bought this place that used to be a  slaughterhouse back in the 1800s.  For what?  Slaughtering cows and shit.  So the cows are haunting him now?  Hang on.  Let me...  No, no.  Yeah, someone's mooing.  The milk is always spilled. 
[02:38:00]  But they wound up closing down and these satanic cults took it over and they actually decapitated  this girl.  There was a big...  One of the biggest murder things in Kentucky and they found this girl's head in a well  and all that.  Then, over the years, it was taken over by casinos, illegal gambling, prohibition.  Casino business.  A lot of people, murders there, a lot of deaths, a lot of people, some girl killed her father  and then committed suicide in the basement.  Nice place.  It actually has a sign in the front.  It's a country western bar, okay? 
[02:38:30]  And it has a sign in the front that says, if you are attacked by any paranormal activity,  we are not responsible.  Well, they say that to get you in.  How the hell?  Of course.  This guy tried to keep it.  It's a selling point.  It actually killed his business.  You can't sue him?  How would that be in court?  Hey, it was a ghost.  No, there's a lady that sued him.  It's on the internet.  A lady tried to sue...  It's on the internet.  It's got to be true.  The ghost is with the most...  No, they have the document.  They have the document, the actual court document.  She's trying to sue because she was attacked by a ghost.  But they had this shit on last night.  These guys were in the basement. 
[02:39:00]  But it's not those ghost shows where they have all the people and the camera guys in  the talk.  Ghost, we're here to help.  This guy's like this tough guy, muscle guy.  But he screams like a little girl?  No, but he screams.  He talks to the ghost.  He's like, come on, attack me right now.  Scratch me, you son of a bitch.  He's like taunting the team.  He's a tough guy with ghosts.  Yeah.  With Chief Brody.  The ghost scratches him and he's like, ah, look, I got to get out of here.  Wait, hold on.  I'll be leaving.  Let me ask the most gullible man alive.  So what exactly?  Watch it.  Watch it. 
[02:39:30]  Wait, so the tough guy got scratched?  He got scratched.  How, though?  Did they ever explain that?  No, he's screaming at them.  They have video of him getting scratched with nothing around him to do it?  This is the video they had last night.  They actually, he's sitting there screaming.  What they do, like these other people, they get locked in.  They say, padlock us into this haunted place.  We're not getting out until the morning.  So they're stuck in there, no matter what happens.  And it's just three guys.  That's a good concept.  There's just three guys.  What was that show, Scare Tactics?  Not Scare Tactics.  What was the other one where they kind of did this? 
[02:40:00]  It was on MTV or something.  The Partridge Family?  I forgot the name.  It was hot for like a few weeks.  They would go to old prisons and stuff.  Yeah.  It sounds like the same show.  They just repackaged it.  Well, go ahead.  Well, these three guys go in there by themselves.  They lock him in, in the Bob Mackie's place.  And they lock him in the basement.  Nothing about Bob Mackie.  They actually show, they have the video camera shut up.  They have, they show these shadows walking in the background.  You can see all this crazy shit.  And then this guy's screaming at the demons, attack me, attack me. 
[02:40:30]  It's, it's called the gateway to hell, this well where they found the lady's head and  all the Satan worshipers used to conduct business.  And then he's like, dude, my back is on fire right now.  And they, they're like, what's wrong?  And he picked up his shirt and then you can see these three scratches on his back.  When did they stop the camera so they could scratch this guy?  Well, if you got it, you know what?  Did you look for cuts?  You guys, I.  Cuts in the action?  Like, okay, wait, now that could have been.  Okay.  Okay.  So you're saying this is absolute proof. 
[02:41:00]  So there is life after death.  There is some kind of spirit world.  Yes.  So no one has to worry because when you die, you'll, you'll, you'll have, you'll be a  spirit.  You could haunt a place, scratch people's backs.  No, no, no, no.  Demons are different than ghosts.  What?  Demons are different than ghosts.  Ghosts are human.  Demons aren't human.  Well, how did he know it was a demon?  Because it scratched them in the three.  Ghosts can scratch?  Sign of the Trinity, which is three.  Yes. 
[02:41:30]  Wow.  Most colorful.  I don't know, but.  But dude, he's got a legal disclaimer, dude.  It's like it was on the internet.  I said, well, it's on the internet.  It's got to be true.  And then he goes, no, the document was on the internet.  Oh, like you can't just.  Give me a document.  I'll put it in Photoshop for five minutes and make it look completely different.  This is where Bob made me want to spit in his face.  You make Star Wars over in your house, you fucking nerd.  Bob said they got the actual court.  You have a green screen, you fucking asshole.  Sorry.  He said they got the actual court documents.  Sorry to interrupt you if I could smash. 
[02:42:00]  Sorry.  Me.  Actual court documents.  Yeah.  Like, what a.  No, dude.  They got the actual document.  Oh, sorry.  It was like, Danny, if you're worth your salt, you'll get that document.  Bobby D and Brock didn't.  The show was called Fear.  Sounds like the.  No.  No, the old show, Fear.  Yeah, yeah.  A lot of the same stuff.  And I was, I was into it for a while.  What, it'd be called Bunko?  Dude, let me tell you something.  I'll fucking.  I'd love for you to.  I want to see the clip because I bet you we could, we could pick it apart.  It's on the internet.  And go, all right, look, this is where the camera stopped and they scratched his back.  Did we get to see his back before this happened? 
[02:42:30]  No, it's a question.  Yeah.  So maybe the scratch were already there.  I'll tell you this.  I'll tell you this.  How did he know it was going to be scratched?  So why did they show it beforehand?  I'm kidding, I'm kidding.  Listen, I saw this on one of the ghosts.  But you understand they could scratch his back and then, all right, time to make believe  that scratch just happened.  Lift up your shirt, make believe you're in pain.  Ghosts are real.  Roll credits.  I saw, I saw, I saw, I saw, I saw, I saw, I saw one of these ghost things that the guy  actually got scratched on camera. 
[02:43:00]  There was a demon attacking this guy.  No, there wasn't.  I swear to God, I swear to fucking God, I saw it.  No, I wasn't.  Swear to God.  That would be on every news channel.  Okay, look, that would be the biggest story ever.  Oh my God, there are ghosts.  It's real.  I think he did it to himself.  Dude, YouTube, YouTube, real ghosts, they have a little girl sitting in a chair and it's  just bouncing off the ground.  So what?  She's having fun.  A lot of those videos are made up.  How is that made up?  I don't know.  It's a white trash family.  I don't know all the trickery, but somebody would buy a huge magnet to stick under their 
[02:43:30]  floor.  Maybe.  A magnet, what kind of cartoons are you watching?  Maybe they just have wires.  No wires.  Have you ever seen a magic show?  It's hard to see the wire.  The show actually brings it to physicists.  Physicists.  Is there any video of that, Danny?  No?  Of course not.  Why wouldn't it be on YouTube?  Why?  Why?  Why?  Why?  Why?  Why?  Why?  Ghost Adventures?  Let's not believe it would be called that.  How's this?  It would be called, holy shit, most amazing thing ever in Earth's history.  Right.  It has to have a cute name, right? 
[02:44:00]  Yeah.  Anthony's onto something here.  This is fucked up.  Holy shit, Jesus did exist.  Oh my God.  It wouldn't be, here's cute Jesus walking around with holes in his palms.  Let me tell you something.  I went to use my phone.  Okay?  I went to make a phone call.  This is scary.  What happened?  Okay, I pick up my brand new iPhone.  Modern technology.  G3.  Can I see your iPhone?  I don't know where it is right now.  But I'd never let you touch anything.  Don't laugh.  We're going to go on the phone.  I went to call the number.  And this, now, I just watched this.  Let's all talk softly like Bobby.  I just watched this.  So you got your new iPhone.  I'm captivated.  I'm very, I'm very scared. 
[02:44:30]  My friend's a ghost hunter.  I'm a pussy when it comes to this stuff.  I'm scared.  I feel, you know when you can feel something else in the room?  That's what I felt.  Yes, like goose chills right now.  And, uh, I, uh, I dialed the phone and this is what I heard.  Yeah, but.  Skulls keys.  No.  Hang on.  I'm not done. 
[02:45:00]  No, that's scary.  Don't do that.  You're scaring me.  Somebody was rewinding a tape.  I swear to God, my fucking cell phone did that.  And I was talking to it.  On an iPhone, you had bad reception.  Oh my God.  Yeah, that's all that is.  Every other word.  Every time, every time I would go, what the fuck, I can't, I don't, I could hear a voice.  Going in, you're doing it.  Just move.  Check recents.  Then breathing.  Check recents and see who made the call.  I made the call.  See what I went to. 
[02:45:30]  What, you called the devil?  The demon?  I was calling, no, I was calling a friend.  None of your business.  But did that friend, did you talk to that friend and go, I tried to call you and got a demon?  Or they say, no, I remember your phone came up.  I couldn't hear you.  Sorry, my friend Dev had the phone.  He had the phone.  Hi, how are you?  Then he realized he was just hearing himself eating.  Just move closer to the window.  Exactly.  Like everyone else.  There's got a ghost in the phone. 
[02:46:00]  It's just bad reception.  There's got to be people out there who had ghost experiences.  Oh, you want to go to the phones?  Ghost experience.  Why don't we start with Bob is such a fucking douchebag.  He must have downloaded an apparition.  Tom from, you said, Tom in Stony Brook.  Tom.  Hey, what's up, guys?  What's up?  Hey, Tom.  What's up?  I just want to point out, man, the first show and the first episode, the guy, the main character,  told him about how tough he is and he's not scared.  He goes halfway through the first night. 
[02:46:30]  They jump out of the fire escape from the second floor.  He was scared shitless.  And he ran off the shelf.  Yeah, dude.  This guy, I mean, this show.  Because that makes good TV.  You're not going to sit there and be like, wow, another haunted house with nothing around.  So we'll just hand this in to the network and hope for the best.  Did you, now when you watched that show, dude, was that some freaky shit or what?  It definitely was.  But when the guy got scratched, Bob's leaving this part out.  When the guy got scratched, he had a shirt on and he got scratched underneath the shirt. 
[02:47:00]  It's not like they just showed his back and the scratches.  How do we know his back was not scratched before he took his shirt off?  You know, you don't know.  All right.  So, yes, we do.  It was scratched before he took his shirt off.  Right.  That's what I'm guessing.  It's a bunch of malarkey, sir.  It's a bunch of words.  Excuse my language.  There's an old wizardry happening here.  Some wizardry.  My friend Ted was a ghost hunter.  Ted the ghost hunter?  No way.  Yes, he was.  Did he tell you any stories?  No.  Oh.  He just was.  That's right. 
[02:47:30]  Everyone's saying, so the guy's back could be scratched before?  You guys.  That would be an easy one.  There's no person.  I investigate the paranormal.  Oh, Ted.  Yes.  I investigate ghosts and goblins and such.  Oh.  It's scary, Ted.  Are you hearing that music or is it just me again?  What music?  Oh, good.  I hear that music often, Gregory.  I investigate ghosts.  You've seen a lot of ghosts?  I've seen many. 
[02:48:00]  Boo.  Ah.  And I leave the premises immediately.  That's not much of a ghost hunter.  I don't.  I just don't have a ghost catcher.  I just find them and leave quickly.  You're scared.  Yes, I am very afraid of ghosts.  So why are you in this business?  Because I want to know where the ghosts are.  So I avoid those places.  Ghosts.  Yes.  I hate ghosts.  You don't like ghosts?  No.  Ghosts.  Scare me tremendously, Robert. 
[02:48:30]  How many ghosts have you seen?  4,275.  That's a lot of ghosts.  It certainly is, Anthony.  Oh, they're terrible.  They come in.  They go, boo.  And I go, ah.  You run away.  I run as quickly as I can.  Have you ever had a ghost attack you, Ted?  Yes, I have.  What knocked my macaroni on the floor?  Mother had made me some macaroni.  And there were two ghosts.  And they were quarreling.  And they spilled my macaroni. 
[02:49:00]  I used to have a ghost come into my bedroom when I was a boy.  And he would do things to my hiney.  Terrible.  Yes, he smelled of liquor and cigarettes.  What did he look like?  He looked like my uncle.  He would come on the floor with my uncle.  And he would put ghostly things in my backside.  That sounds frightening.  It was very scary.  I would yell.  And then I would feel this ghostly cigarette smelling hands around my face. 
[02:49:30]  Why didn't you run away from that?  Because I was small, Anthony.  I couldn't go anywhere.  My feety pajamas were on.  Did he open up the little trap door in the back?  The ghost would rip them down.  He'd go, be quiet, Ted.  Poor young Ted.  I was very upset, Anthony.  I said, oh boy, I'm going to hunt ghosts for the rest of my life and avoid them.  And avoid them.  Ted is an awful ghost hunter. 
[02:50:00]  I don't like ghosts.  I carry a fan so I can fan them away from me.  And they just blow away.  They're wispy apparitions.  That's all we need to do?  Yes, just fan them away.  Go shoo.  So keep a fan around.  Okay.  Let's say hi to Mr. Motherfucker.  Mr. Motherfucker, how are you today? 
[02:50:30]  I had a question for Bob.  Okay.  You're leaving everything on TV.  Have you bought real estate from Eric Estrada?  What did you say?  Ah, yeah.  Are you buying land from Eric Estrada?  Because it sounds like a good deal.  It really does, though.  Yeah, it does.  Bob is actually right.  There was a ghost.  And I saw the actual court document.  Oh, you did.  I certainly did.  And there's a disclaimer.  If you're hurt by ghosts, you're not allowed to sue the proprietor of this establishment. 
[02:51:00]  I've tried suing one time.  I slipped on the icy pavement and hurt my elbow.  And I claimed that ghosts pushed me to the ground angrily.  You seem to have a hard time with that word.  No, I don't.  Angrily.  Ghosts.  Oh, ghosts.  Plural of ghosts.  Yes, that's ghosts.  When was the last time you had a ghost experience? 
[02:51:30]  I see ghosts a couple of times a day.  Have you seen one today?  Yes.  I was in a Caldor trying to buy a sweatshirt.  And there was a ghost in the sweatshirt rack.  And he went, moo.  And I ran away screaming.  A Caldor?  Yes.  I went shopping today in 1987.  Hey, we got Matt who ran away from a ghost once.  Ted, stay close.  We're going to need your expertise here.  Matt, what's up? 
[02:52:00]  Good evening, boys.  Hello, Matthew.  Hey, guys, this story really makes you sound like a fat ass.  But a couple years back, we're at some Civil War battlefield.  And we're walking down the path.  And we hear what to us is a loud scream.  Yes.  Well, we turn away to run.  I trip over my fat friend.  I turn back to look at what we're just running from.  And I run into a fucking sign breaking three ribs.  My friends come over to me, pick me up.  They look behind us. 
[02:52:30]  There is a fucking ball of light chasing after us.  See, that's proof.  This man's not proof.  There are ghosts.  And they're chasing us all over reenactment scenes.  Sir, sir, I believe you completely.  My God almighty, there's ghosts among us.  Ted says so.  Yes, I do.  I was sleeping the other night.  I heard a thud.  And I knew it was the demons had come to drag me away.  So I sat up and masturbated until the sun came up.  Well, that's a great way to keep the ghosts away.  The ghosts don't come near you when you're doing that for some reason. 
[02:53:00]  No, no.  Is that better than the fan?  What, son?  I heard you.  Ted's a smart ass.  We are reminded that Bob Kelly also told us he saw a werewolf in Iraq.  Yeah, that is true.  Oh, my God.  That's right.  Consider the source.  Wait until it comes out.  And, dude, it was a werewolf in the middle of the road.  Was it?  It was, yes.  It was a fucking werewolf.  Wait till you see.  Wait.  Hey, I'm going to do everyone a favor today.  We all got our food.  And I know the listeners hate when we eat. 
[02:53:30]  So we're going to do a food.  You can't even tell I'm fucking eating.  I get fucking fire.  So we're all going to eat on the air.  We're going to take a quick break.  We're going to try to shove some food down our trots.  And when we get back, we're going to have more from Ted the Ghost Hunter.  Robert Kelly, who's doing Wilbur Theater in Boston.  This Friday.  And some great pendulum remakes.  Oh, I love that.  Why don't we do that after the break?  Okay.  And more of your phone calls.  Yum. 
[02:54:00]  Never.  Ooh.  Spooky.  Dude, dude.  Dude, dude.  Well, Ted requested this coming back from break.  Dude, dude.  Yeah.  Hey, we got a guy that actually stayed at this Bob Mackie place.  You want to talk to him?  Yeah.  All right.  Oh, boy. 
[02:54:30]  Ooh, I'm debating.  Oh, Kelly.  Bobby, I apologize ahead of time.  This line is real.  This line is very good, though.  Brad in West Virginia.  Happy birthday, Jimmy.  Thank you, Brad.  What's up?  Oh, wrong guy.  Hey, guys.  Actually, I know why Bob Kelly's afraid of ghosts.  Yeah.  Every time he does a stand-up back, all he hears is, boo.  That's hilarious.  That was actually a really good line.  Yeah. 
[02:55:00]  Ooh.  And he delivered it perfectly.  He didn't get over-anxious.  That was a good one.  Good for you.  Where can I buy a ghost?  Boo.  Oh, this question's coming in for Ted, but Ted's mouth is still full, so we're going to  hold on for one second.  Let's get this real story from Mike in Kentucky.  Mikey.  Mike.  You stayed at the Mackie place, Mike.  Yeah, I'm from Newport, Kentucky, down there, and I don't know if that was just an urban  myth or what, but, man, when I was a kid, I used to hear that all the time.  What?  I was just like, I was just sitting going, I used to hear that all the time, and then 
[02:55:30]  waiting, and then nothing.  What did you hear, sir?  Yeah.  I'm sorry?  Yeah, I heard something in the background.  It was like a voice.  Maybe someone else from Kentucky could help us out.  Jay from Florida, from Wack Bag.  Do you guys owe Huey Lewis three bucks now?  Dingy, dingy.  And Jamie Hughes from Tom's River, I want to request Werewolf Bar Mitzvah for Bobby Kelly.  What was that again?  I think it was...  I forgot about that one.  That was Tracy. 
[02:56:00]  Oh, right, right.  Tracy Morgan.  Yeah, if you got that for Bobby today, that'd be great.  Who had a question for Ted?  Tracy Morgan.  Where did Ted...  I don't...  Ted?  Ted's around.  He is?  He just shows up.  Ted is ghostly.  Can you go old school impression where you turn around and then become Ted when you turn  back around?  Probably is the way it will happen.  It's almost like Ted.  But please go old school.  I know it's a visual, but I used to love when they did that on Carson and stuff.  What was the line that you used to use?  And it sounds a little...  Something.  I think it would sound something like this. 
[02:56:30]  It was so...  Turn around.  Oh, was that awful.  I think Rich Little was guilty of that, right?  And then sometimes they do the quick turnaround over the shoulder, and then, yeah, the audience  applause, and then you go into the...  What about Fred Travellini?  Was he guilty of that?  Oh, God.  Fred Travellini.  Worst impressionist ever.  He was on one of the cruise ships I was on.  No.  Yeah.  He was on one of the cruise ships, and it could possibly have been the worst thing I've ever  seen in my life.  I was hoping for a torpedo, an errant mine left by some Nazi submarine or... 
[02:57:00]  Some Somalians.  Just anything.  Somali pirates.  An RPG from a Somalian pirate.  Anything with Fred Travellina.  Oh.  Oof.  And what was he doing?  What impressions does he claim to do?  Like George Bush thinks he's doing that.  How's it go?  He thought he did...  I don't know.  I don't remember much of it.  I was hoping he would do his finale as Leon Klinghoffer. 
[02:57:30]  You should have been like Joe Taurus and just raised your hand and go, can I, I don't  know, can I try an impression?  And then go up there and just destroy him.  I think he did do like a Reagan or something.  It was just, he's so bad.  He's so awful.  He was never good at the impressions.  Never.  Fred Travellini.  Who was a good impressionist?  But then cruise people, they will, they will applaud at, at the dumbest comics and acts  and stuff.  And you sit there and go, what the fuck?  Where are you from? 
[02:58:00]  They like that shit.  You find this entertaining boat acts.  Hells yeah.  Ugh.  I think Jay Moore does.  Jay Moore does good impressions because he does obscure motherfuckers.  Yeah, and he's got like the, the material.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Like if you do Colin Quinn impression, you can't just do it and not say things that Colin  would say.  It doesn't work.  Mm-hmm.  Like he says shit that Colin would say.  All right.  Let's go to John in Virginia.  We got a question for Ted.  He's done with that.  Uh, I don't, I don't see Ted. 
[02:58:30]  I still see Jimmy, but hopefully Ted will be here in time to answer this question.  John in Virginia.  Good morning, boys.  Hello.  Hi.  Jimmy, love your show down dirty.  I hope they pick it up, man.  Oh, thank, from your lips to God's ears.  Oh.  Yeah, I got a question for Ted.  I'm experiencing a little paranormal activity around my house.  Where can I pick up some, uh, you know, some ghost finding products or anything like  that?  You know what's funny you can ask?  He turned around and came back and said, there are plenty of ghost finding products 
[02:59:00]  and you can get them at Ted's Ghost Finding Products Emporium.  I've got everything from fans to other things that make the wind move.  Ted owns so many emporiums.  Excuse me.  My eyes are just acting up.  I get very nervous when speaking of ghosts.  It's a good question, though, sir. 
[02:59:30]  Sometimes what I do is I recommend a hammer.  And if a ghost is in the area, you just begin hammering him at whatever chair he's sitting  on or table he's next to.  I thought it would go right through a ghost.  It does tend to do that, Anthony.  It's a good point.  I've gotten scolded quite a few times.  Theodore, those are my dishes.  Can you use a vacuum?  A vacuum?  You certainly can if you want to clean up carpet. 
[03:00:00]  But as far as ghost hunting, no.  Why not?  I don't know.  I never thought of that.  I use a vacuum once to masturbate myself.  I make cubsies inside the vacuum.  My mother said, Theodore, remove your genitals from inside that vacuum hose.  I said, shut up, bitch.  And I fucked from the mouth.  I'm all kidding.  I'm just being racy.  I don't like language like that.  Are they like ghosts, like black ghosts, white ghosts, Puerto Rican ghosts?  Are they all just regular ghosts? 
[03:00:30]  I think they're all just, I would love to feed into your tomfoolery, Robert, but I think  they're all apparitions, and they're not based on race or gender or sexual preference.  So there's no women ghosts?  I don't know if there's any woman ghosts.  I've never tried to figure the vagina of an apparition.  I tend to fan them away quickly.  He gets very scared.  Yes, I do.  He blows away.  Boo!  Ah! 
[03:01:00]  Wow.  I think a vacuum would work, though, because it would suck him in, and then blow him.  Blow him out.  Yes, but then what are you going to do?  You'll have a bag full of ghosts?  Who needs a vacuum bag full of ghosts?  I certainly don't.  Couldn't you take him then and throw them out?  I'm not carrying a bag of ghosts to the dumbwaiter.  The dumbwaiter.  You gotta...  Are you supposed to leave a bag of ghosts?  And then as soon as they go to the garbage truck, it'll go...  And it'll burst the bag of ghosts. 
[03:01:30]  We'll become free yet again.  But maybe they'll be down the road and go to somebody else's house.  That's a good point, but I don't want to push my ghost problem off on another, Anthony.  That's very considerate.  Yes, plus I don't think it'll work.  I think they'll come back and haunt me mercilessly.  Weed or...  Moo!  We have another question for Ted.  He's so scared and runs away.  Yeah, we got Brian in Philly.  Another question?  Yes, good morning.  Good morning. 
[03:02:00]  Ted...  Yes, Brian, good luck to the Philadelphia Phillies.  Well, thank you, sir.  Ted, when you...  You're welcome.  When you see ghosts, are they naked or are they wearing clothes?  I see them as smoky apparitions.  I don't see them as faces.  Sometimes like a sheet.  Like Casper often.  Yes, floating by.  I one time ran through a patio window because the ghosts were trying to pinch my fanny. 
[03:02:30]  It sounds harrowing.  It certainly was harrowing, Anthony.  It's an excellent word for it.  Ted, are you a big fan of the ghost movies?  I don't go for staring at movies, Gregory.  I like Disney films.  My films have put a smile on my face.  I don't like horror films.  They frighten me.  Yeah.  Yes, they do.  What was the scariest movie you ever saw?  Oh, I don't know.  I don't make it to the first...  I saw The Exorcist. 
[03:03:00]  Yeah.  That was very frightening.  That is scary.  It certainly is.  I threw the DVD out.  I was very nervous.  Yeah, Little Reagan, her name was.  Oh, I wouldn't know.  I didn't get that far.  The opening music frightened me.  So I removed the DVD, and I put in something...  Ah!  Oh, you're scared of the music.  She makes pee-pee on the floor.  Yes, I heard that.  That's why I got it.  I thought that would be fun.  I thought it was pornography.  Oh, little girl tingles, don't she? 
[03:03:30]  Well, this ought to be interesting.  That's very scary.  Is Jimmy in the room?  Because we want to do some...  I don't...  Is Jimmy in the room?  Because I want to do some Pendulum remakes.  Oh, all right.  Oh, I talked like Jim first.  I'm not...  I know.  I know Fred Travolina.  You kind of messed up the little dumb bit we had going. 
[03:04:00]  But...  Hey...  Ted's got a dumb waiter.  Yeah.  Nice to know.  Really?  Why don't we...  Is Voss your waiter?  What do you mean?  Dumb waiter.  All right, listen.  We got some Pendulum remakes.  Tony, get it?  Pendulum remakes.  Do we have the hook?  Just to bring everyone on board?  Pendulum.  The hook of Pendulum, please.  Ow!  Yeah.  Wow.  We got people remaking that song in many, many different ways. 
[03:04:30]  Yeah.  And the boys are talking about one that is just unbelievable today.  We're going to get to that in a second, but we want to...  Want to play a couple others before we get there?  Oh!  Little Tiger, baby.  What's wrong with its foot?  He's injured his foot halfway.  Oh, my good God.  Little Tiger stepped on a tack! 
[03:05:00]  I don't think that would hurt him that much.  You look very injured.  Yeah.  Wow, she's hot, too.  What's with MSNBC?  They just, like, pile on the hot chick reporters.  You think that one's hot?  She's all right.  She's better than any other reporter.  Like, you know, reporter, you got to kind of set the bar.  Yeah, like Roz Abrams.  Who hasn't jerked off to her many guys?  Roz.  I want Roz Abrams to shit on my chest.  Oh, God.  You stinky one, I bet.  Oh, God.  I smell like the worst. 
[03:05:30]  Picture Roz Abrams takes giant dumps.  Roz.  You guys want to hear some of these pendulum remakes today?  Oh, please.  Scott Queen, Roz Abrams.  Danny's going to help us through this.  What's the first one you want to take a look at?  Well, if we could run the gauntlet from terrible to really, really good.  And if we're going to do that.  Start with the original, you mean.  Everybody's favorite from my radio store, Ziggy, has entered his, what I entitled, 
[03:06:00]  embarrassingly bad entry.  But you're friends with the guy.  I am, but dude, it's so fucking shitty and awful, and he knows it, too.  Why are we telling the ONA community that Ziggy sucks unless he's selling, like, radios?  Because he does.  MyradioStore.com for all your, whatever this company needs.  For all your serious XM needs.  Yes, here's Ziggy's intro.  Pendulum! 
[03:06:30]  And that's Ziggy.  Wow, what the fuck was he thinking?  Does he sing?  Yeah, he does.  It's coming up.  It, it, it, like...  You know how these work?  You can turn it off, because I can't deal with it.  You can totally tell it's Ziggy. 
[03:07:00]  I kind of like it.  You can shock you.  Oh, no.  Gonna lock you down.  Pendulum will shift with a little bit of pressure.  Danny can't look at anybody.  Yeah, but I, I gotta give him...  Oh.  He's gotta tell me if I'm correct, but it looks like he's going for, like, a Juno thing.  Is he?  When they were singing those...  I don't know what he was doing.  ...gay songs in Juno?  Is he, is he, is he, is he, this is a joke, right?  This is a joke, right?  I'm gonna get you, show you, show you, show you, gonna throw you around. 
[03:07:30]  Oh.  You did the crime, but not the time.  Now you're gonna pay for what you've done.  You better run.  Had all I can take of all your screaming in my ear.  My back is gonna break if you push me one more time.  Oh, oh.  My heart's getting heavy. 
[03:08:00]  My blood's getting cold.  You changed me into something that I just can't control.  Oh, damn.  Didn't you see me coming?  Let's get out my way.  Cause the pendulum is swinging back the other way.  Oh.  Pendulum can take only so much less.  This is great.  Wow.  This is so heavy sweating.  You gotta leave it on now.  Danny's uncomfortable.  This is great.  Jump you.  It's so bad.  Jump you out.  It's like, almost like a Who's Tommy thing going on in there somewhere. 
[03:08:30]  Breaking down the walls of magic town.  There aren't that many chords in this song.  No, huh?  He doesn't know a lot of chords.  The kingdom falling down.  Hey, can we end the show with The Seeker, by the way, by The Who, today?  Oh, yeah?  I'd rather write it with Ziggy.  Bill Maher uses it in Religious.  I know that has nothing to do, but when you said fucking Tommy, which made me think  Who?  That fucking song.  I forgot how great that was. 
[03:09:00]  All right.  Back to Pendulum.  Who?  Who?  Who?  Who?  Who?  Who are you?  Who?  Who?  Who?  Who?  Yuck.  What's the next one we're going to take a look at?  Well, let's do...  We could do Coke Logics, which is track four.  That's up top, meaning you didn't like his either.  It was all right.  He's got a very strange style.  This is the remix one.  He had sent in another one, which he wasn't happy with, and this was his final draft.  Someone is... 
[03:09:30]  I don't know.  Dan in Ohio is saying that was good.  Dan, there was something about that dumb thing.  Dan.  No way.  Yeah, the end of it.  Dan.  What?  Huh?  Maybe he's deaf and can't hear you talking.  Hey, Dan.  What?  What is he...  Forget it.  All right, Coke Logics.  The pendulum will swing at the center of attention 
[03:10:00]  Just another date, another condescension  Mark you and Jack you, it's gonna lock you down  The pendulum will shift with a little bit of pressure  Move too slow and the pendulum will catch you  Show you and move you, it's gonna roll you around  You did the crime but not the time 
[03:10:30]  Now you gotta pay for what you've done, you better run  I've had all I can take of all your screaming in my ear  My back is gonna break if you push me one more time  My heart's getting heavy, my blood's getting cold  You changed me into something that I just can't control  When you see me come and bust it out of my way  The pendulum is swinging back the other way  Yeah, it's pretty much a covered version.  It's not bad.  It's like tribute band version. 
[03:11:00]  Yeah, it's actually not that bad.  It's not bad.  But it's exactly...  That's like trying to sound like Steve and Foundry.  Yeah.  Keeping the same melody and stuff.  Yeah, yeah.  It was really kind of not mixing it up that much.  Ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho.  How's the original go?  I'm a hockin'  It's out of my way.  Get out of my way.  We're gonna end this with a really, really good one.  But a couple more maybe? 
[03:11:30]  Yeah, this one came in a couple days ago.  It's really weird.  It's kind of like an 8-bit Nintendo game style.  Nice.  Okay.  Kind of like the Mega Man opening sort of.  And this is from John.  Yeah.  Welcome aboard, John.  John.  Hey, John.  Hey, John.  Hey, John.  Do it for Johnny.  Do it for Johnny.  Ooh.  Ooh.  Ooh.  Wow.  Nice. 
[03:12:00]  Oh, yeah.  King of Freddy's tape is eyes.  Ooh, I know what that is.  Yeah.  King of Freddy's New York.  No.  No.  It's Super Mario version.  This is actually in Mega Man 9, when you fight homo man. 
[03:12:30]  Look at it over and fire.  Don't fall.  I love it.  How long does that kind of ringer?  Yeah.  Everybody pretty good right now.  It's very rare.  My God.  Ha ha ha ha. 
[03:13:00]  Oh.  Oh.  Is this actually in a video game like this?  that's really  Bobby actually said  this is in a video game  like this  I didn't say that  that was Norton  oh okay  I thought Mr. Gullible  no I was saying

[03:16:00]  my heart's getting  heavy  my blood's getting  cold  you're dreaming  in the summer  but I don't think  it's trouble  losing me time  and that's too hot  in my way  I can't be alone  but swimming  back the other way  not bad  not bad  not bad  at all  it's not one of my  faves  like I said  we'll play the full  versions  in between the two  halves of the show  starting tomorrow  is it weird  Steve you're hearing 
[03:16:30]  all this  you're hearing  your song  redone  it's different  than a joke  but is it weird  to hear  is it cool  it's weird  to hear  all the different  interpretations  that's one of the  reasons we're not  putting them online  because we don't  want anybody  to be influenced  one way or the other  but eventually  we're going to  put them online  because everyone's  screaming for that  it's your mature work  it's cool  I'm completely  shocked that people  just take  something that was  done 11 years ago  and doesn't sound  anything like that  and took something  like the main riff  and made it sound  like sad  and white  that's carried away 
[03:17:00]  there's a little  wolf mother  in there too  yeah  I like the wolf mother  it's a U2 tribute  it is  I wasn't  the vocals  didn't get you  the vocals  a little cartoony  yeah I agree  I kind of liked  it was different  I liked it  I liked the guitar  myself  I liked the uncomfort  the music was good  it was pretty good  the good ones  are fucked up  next up is a band  called Aspirin Hammer  okay  and this is in the  style of the Ramones  oh  when it said 
[03:17:30]  Ramones style  I was thinking  Ramones  oh no no  I like the actual  band  oh very cool  alright  let's check out  Aspirin Hammer  Heading up a swing  every bit of tension  just another day  another constitution  I keep shocking  gonna lock you down 
[03:18:00]  Pendulum chip with a little bit of pressure  Who's too slow when the pendulum gets to show you more  You're gonna throw you around  You did the crime but not the time  Now you've got to pay for what you've done  You better run  I've had all that I can take 
[03:18:30]  Of all you're dreaming in my ear  My back is gonna break  If you push me one more time  My heart's getting heavy, my blood's getting cold  You change me into stuff and I just can't control  If you see me coming fast, get out of my way  Cause the pendulum is swinging back the other way  I like this one.  Yeah, that one's good.  Definitely.  It's very true to that style of music.  I like that. 
[03:19:00]  I like that a lot.  I like the last one better.  No, I like that one.  Well, Bob, we're gonna have to agree to disagree  But that's what's good about our country.  Once again, we'll play the full versions  In between the two halves of the show.  I like just playing through the chorus  And then, you know, that's all you really need.  You know what?  You don't need any more.  No.  What's the next one?  Why did Olivia Newton-John's W's look like U's?  God, that fucking, the brilliance of that joke.  Sorry.  I've been obsessed for 24 hours  With the physical perfection of that joke. 
[03:19:30]  It annoyed me it was so good.  Thank you, sir.  Jesus Christ, was that a gem?  A doozy.  That was the proverbial home run.  Oh, thank you.  And out of the parker.  Dude, that was just, that was almost artistic.  Mean-spirited.  It had everything.  It was brutal and unnecessary.  Unnecessary.  All the features.  Unprovoked.  There's no reason for it.  How could she provoke that?  I don't know.  Showing up.  In a fucking bikini top. 
[03:20:00]  Tommy T from Albuquerque.  I heard that, too.  Ramones meets South Park.  I heard a little bit of Cartman in there.  A little bit, a little bit.  What's the next one, Danny?  This one is a hip-hop slash R&B.  It's kind of like a modern hip-hop R&B.  It's a guy named Rich, but the vocals is done by a woman.  Okay.  So it's a little different.  Yeah, a little different.  First one with a gal.  A woman.  Second one, really.  I'm sorry. 
[03:20:30]  Oh.  No.  Ah!  He rubs his beard on my neck and I make crumbsies.  It hurts.  Panginoa, Panginoa, Panginoa, Panginoa.  Panginoa, Panginoa, Panginoa.  Oh.  Panginoa, Panginoa, Panginoa.  Panginoa, Panginoa, Panginoa.  Oh.  Angeline will swing at the center of attention 
[03:21:00]  Just another day, another kind of sunshine  Mark you, Jack you, gonna let you down  Angeline will shift a little bit of pressure  Move too slow and the pendulum will get you 
[03:21:30]  Show you, mow you, gonna throw you around  You did the time, but not the time  Now you've got to pay for what you've done  You better run  I've had all I can take of all you screaming in my ear  My back is on a break, break, break  If you punch me one more time  My heart is getting heavy 
[03:22:00]  My blood is getting cold  You've changed me into something  That I can't control  If you see me coming  Let's get out my way  Cause the pendulum is swinging back the other way  The pendulum can take only so much better  A lot of comments coming in on this one 
[03:22:30]  Oh, no kidding  Yes  A lot of people not a fan of the genre  Pat from Munaki  Sounds like every porn chick that goes into singing  Other people asking, is this the new James Bond song  For the new James Bond movie  Wasn't this song in Scarface  Really, I don't think they're digging it that much  Alright, well  That song made me hate the word pendulum  Pendulum  We can play Ziggy's again if you want 
[03:23:00]  Ziggy's was very good  I like Ziggy's  I like Ziggy's  There's something about it I like  There's something about that shit  You know he's alone on GarageBand  All day  Ziggy's was terrible  Terrible  C-D  C-D-A  And you know he started it as like a serious thing  And then he knew it sucked  So then he just went with it  Yeah  But like that started as a soulful thing  Do you think he let his girl listen to it?  What do you think?  I think it's good 
[03:23:30]  No, seriously  Is my vocals?  Yeah, they're okay  She's lying to his face  Alright, let's  What do you mean?  The original or the Ziggy one?  We got two more to go  And everyone's saying this  The last one could win the whole thing  Gino from Philly  If Danny doesn't win line of the day  For his Mega Man 9 line  I will stab a bitch  I spit coffee all over my keyboard  Great job, Danny  The next one's from Matt  Yeah, this is  It's a duet actually  With the chick too  I forget  I don't have her name here  But this is like  They're really talented 
[03:24:00]  Like jazz musicians  And they decided that  They don't like lounge jazz  So what a perfect way  To incorporate shitty music  And a shitty song  By putting the two together  It's really good?  I think it's really good  Alright  Oh shit  This could be good  Has potential, right?  Pendulum will swing  At the center  It's like a kids TV show theme  Just another day 
[03:24:30]  Another condescension  She's the best singer so far  Yeah, this is good  A real singer  Mock you, shock you  I'm gonna lock you down  Like Swing Out Sister  Or whatever the hell  That band was  Like Steve and Edie  Pendulum will shift  With a little bit of pressure  It's the magic garden  On Sunday morning  And the pendulum will get you  Don't let it get you 
[03:25:00]  Oh yeah, I'm gonna throw you around  I'll bring it to you  You did the crime  The kind of times  And now you've gotta pay  For what you've done  You better run  For what you've done  I've had all I can take of  Your screaming in my ears  My back is gonna break  If you push me one more time 
[03:25:30]  Don't push me  My heart's getting heavy  My blood's getting cold  You changed me into something  That I just can't control  If you see me coming  Best get out of my way  That's my shot  I'm gonna play  Wait, is there a way to rewind?  I gotta hear that one again  She did it  That was great  It's my work  We love the little nuances  That you're hearing 
[03:26:00]  Some of these things  Don't push me  My heart's getting heavy  My blood's getting cold  You changed me into something  That I just can't control  If you see me coming  Best get out of my way  Best get out of my way  The other way  Make it back  The other way  Someone wrote Peter, Paul, and Ferry  There's just no tragedy 
[03:26:30]  Bump you, chump you, I'm gonna dump you out  I'll dump you out  Oh my god  The pendulum will break under too much tension  Breaking down the walls of my detention 
[03:27:00]  That's right, I just rhyme tension  Breaking down the kingdom fall down  Let's break it down  You did the crime, but by the time you gotta pay  For what you have done, you better run  I have all I can take of your screaming in my ears 
[03:27:30]  My back is gonna break it, you push me one more time  Don't push me  My heart's getting heavy, my blood's getting cold  It changed me into something that I just can't control  If you see me coming, best get out of my way  The pendulum is swinging back the other way  That's great  How'd your parents die? 
[03:28:00]  What am I doing?  You're in my house  That's terrible, I'm sorry  So, so, sorry  No, no, no, no, no, no, no  Get me a song that doesn't suck  Wow  Wow  That was great  We went to the end of that one  Bravo  That's Matt  Matt, you gotta give credit to the woman  Yeah  Where are they? 
[03:28:30]  Who's the chick?  They're actually local  Are they New York and Jersey?  I think Westchester  They're obviously doing real gigs  They should get a plug for that, man  That was great  That was really good  That was fucking hilarious  Yeah, a lot of compliments coming in on that one  Jesus  Peter Paul and Fer  The Stephen Carpenters  Let's go to Darren in California  Darren  Hey, it sounds like that 70s song  Afternoon Delight  Yeah  Yeah  Yeah, absolutely 
[03:29:00]  It had that whole vibe going to it  Let's go to Mongo the Tracker  Very well done  Sound of the show  Mongo  Arrangement  Guys, contest over that was brilliant  Hysterical  Yeah  Best one yet  That one is good, man  Wow  Everyone's saying that's the best one so far  Let's go to Joe in Vegas  Joe  Yeah, that is definitely the winner  And it is a sad day when I can sing along to Steve Seesaw  A lot of people are saying we should put that as our hold music 
[03:29:30]  While you're waiting to come on the show  It does sound like great hold music  But that's not the one everyone's raving about today, believe it or not  Yeah, well, I mean, that one was really, really good  These are completely different styles  Like the one that you're going to hear now  I mean, that one was obviously like a loungy jazz thing  And this one is something that you could potentially hear on K-Rock like right now  Really?  Or I should say Squiz or if that channel still exists  Yeah  This is from Rich Modern Metal, right?  Yeah  By the way, for the last guys there, it's Matt and Jessica 
[03:30:00]  Matt and Jessica  And they have a website, I don't know what's there  But it's vannastudios.com  V-A-N-A-studios.com  Yeah, go there and compliment them if you really like that  What's up?  I want to see their studio  They're, uh  You trying to see the chick?  You just want to see what the girl looks like  You want to see the chick?  We all do  We all do  We want to see what she looks like  I want to see what the studio looks like with her in it  Who she does?  No, him  Is she hot?  It's only him so far  Yeah, enough of you, Matt  Self-centered ass 
[03:30:30]  I know  It's not about you, Matt  Just puts his name on there  She was singing all the fucking parts  You were just harmonizing, douche  I know, Jesus Christ  I was going to get a picture with Ho Ho Hoey  Oh, really?  Yeah  That's his?  That's it, alright  This fucking Matt's a real creep  Everybody wants a copy of that  Can we throw that one up there at least?  Eventually we'll have all these for you guys to download  For sale  Yeah, for sale  $15 a song  All money going to us  We have to get that in elevators 
[03:31:00]  That's what Jeremy and Indiana said  You might as well because I'm always going down  They call me the seeker  That was good  Alright, Rich Modern Metal  His version of Pendulum  Pendulum will swing at the center of attention  Just another day, another condescension 
[03:31:30]  Mark your shock, you're gonna lock you down  Pendulum will shift with a little bit of pressure  Move too slow and the pendulum will get you  Show you more you've gone  I'll still hold you around  You did the crap another time  Now you're gonna pay for what you've done  You better run  Had all I can take of all these screaming in my ear  The fact is gonna break  If you push me one more time  My heart's getting heavy  My blood's getting cold 
[03:32:00]  You shake me into something that I can't control  If you see me coming  Let's get out of my way  And the love is swinging back the other way  My heart's getting heavy  My blood's getting cold  You shake me into something that I can't control  You see me coming, let's get out of my way  And the love is swinging back the other way  angelem'll break under too much tension  Thank you. 
[03:32:30]  Thank you. 
[03:33:00]  Thank you. 
[03:33:30]  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you. 
[03:34:00]  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  That was Pendulum by Slipknot  here on XM202.  I liked it, but people...  It's mixed.  That was the best one.  Andrew W. Gay.  Wow, I'm surprised you wouldn't like that.  Stinkin' Park.  Are they just trying to... 
[03:34:30]  I think they're just trying to come up with puns.  This feedback is like 80-20.  80-loving it.  That was unbelievable.  It was really good.  It was really well mixed.  It was very well produced.  Just the lyrics that suck.  Thank you.  That sounded great.  I thought that was a really good one.  That was the best one.  Tim C. in Cleveland.  How could these people make a better version of this song  in two weeks that Steve spent a lifetime...  Spent a lifetime trying to make, yeah.  A lot of people saying this rules. 
[03:35:00]  Rage against the big queen.  Oh, people are wishing that the girl that did,  I saw the sign.  I saw the signs.  Did a version.  Open up my eyes.  I saw the signs.  I saw the minding.  That's understanding.  I want to hear that now.  A lot of people have been emailing me.  They want to know when the due date is  to get their entry in because they're still coming in. 
[03:35:30]  The due date.  Oh, the due date.  The due date.  Right now there isn't one set yet, so if you're still working on one, don't be discouraged  because right now it's open.  Yeah, when the bit starts getting old, then we'll throw a date on it.  I think we're working on a prize, too.  Does it bother you that these are better than the original?  Not at all.  Ziggy's was better than the original.  Did you like that last one?  I really did like that last one.  Do you wish that you could jump in and sing it again?  Try it again?  I wish that I could have sang that one.  Not the one I did already on. 
[03:36:00]  DeLorean, my friend.  Steve, I wish he could sing.  Oh, oh, oh, oh.  God damn it.  Steven Carr, you're talking to.  You see it.  Oh.  You see him coming.  That is what?  I just acknowledge he's, you know.  Yeah.  Oh, Feedback loved that one, Ant.  That was great.  They loved that one.  Yeah, that was a good one.  Stinking Park is pretty fun.  Rage Against the Big Queen.  Rage Against the Big Queen.  You're going to shoehorn it a little, but it works. 
[03:36:30]  Nine inch uncut.  I didn't write that.  Somebody on the feedback wrote that.  Oh, no.  But if it worked, you were taking care of it.  I don't see it.  Fucker.  It's great.  You just blame all your bad jokes on fucking pal talk.  No, I'm just saying.  That's what someone wrote.  Yeah, that's what someone wrote.  I didn't say that.  That's a good idea.  I'm doing that from now on.  Yeah.  Yeah, Tim Douchebag from fucking Kentucky.  What was the name of that group that just played it?  It's just from Rich. 
[03:37:00]  Oh, shit.  He didn't leave any other.  No, he didn't leave any.  What's wrong with you?  The guy must have a band to promote.  Hey, fucking Rich.  I think he's got like a website.  This is one reason to do this.  You get a little promotion for your band.  Rich Modern Metal.  That's all he wrote.  He's got to have a real band.  What's up, Hawk?  Not anymore.  What's up, ill-fitting shirt?  Now, that's better.  What's up with your torso, Eric?  Finac?  Is that it?  Familiar, right?  He's got one.  Nine-inch males.  That would have been...  So there's the joke.  What was it?  Nine-inch males. 
[03:37:30]  Thank you.  Thank you for making the joke that I got off, Hawk, Hawk, better.  That's hilarious.  David Blowey is any singer with any gay thing.  That's it for Steve.  Okay, we get it.  David Blowey.  David Blowey.  Let's do a line of the day and get out of here.  What we're going to do with some of the songs that stand out, we're going to play the whole  version in between the two halves of the show or whatever. 
[03:38:00]  To start off the exclusive satellite side of the show.  Yeah.  So the show's over?  Game over.  Well, we start line of the day.  Game over, man.  Who knows?  We could go another half hour.  This is fucking great.  They're coming.  That lounge one was really good.  Very different.  How are we going to figure out who wins this?  I was about to ask that same question.  Maybe we should have voting.  I think they're all winners.  We should probably have voting.  Except Ziggy. 
[03:38:30]  We should somehow have the listeners vote.  Yeah, the listeners have to vote.  Because that...  I mean, this is a lot.  We'll call it down to a reasonable number.  Put them up online.  They could listen and vote away.  At a polling system.  He wants to talk.  WebEx.  Jim says, line of the day.  Keep that going.  Whole meetings, make presentations, and do it from the comfort of your home or office.  Check it out at WebEx.com. 
[03:39:00]  WebEx.com.  I don't know the lyrics, Stephen, but that's a lovely song.  Thank you, Ted.  Pendulums do swing, too.  Works out well.  How do you know about pendulums?  I've seen them swinging in clocks, in grandfather clocks, that stop suddenly in the presence 
[03:39:30]  of ghosts.  I thought perhaps you might have been in the business of selling them.  Maybe ten times.  I never sold pendulums.  That's a dirty business, Daniel.  I won't be involved in it.  A dirty business.  It certainly is.  There's no corruption like there is in the pendulum business.  We all know that.  All those pendulums sold are counterfeited. 
[03:40:00]  They're spray-painted cow patties with little sticks on them.  I never remember seeing a pendulum store.  Can you figure out one?  I once purchased a clock, and the pendulum inside was a cow patty with a stick on it, and my  whole apartment smelled like doody.  Where did you purchase the pendulum?  What's that?  Where did you purchase the pendulum?  It was at a garage sale that had 1,400 pendulums for sale.  I didn't know how they got them.  I didn't want to know.  That doesn't sound like a garage sale.  That sounds like a store of some kind.  No, it was a garage sale. 
[03:40:30]  It was my neighbor.  He was coming away for child molesting charges.  Danny's just laughing at me.  I'm trying so hard.  What'd you say?  I just wanted to know if there's a store that sold them.  No, there's not.  I've answered that question, Anthony.  What do you want me to say?  Oh, yeah, there's a store called Pendulum in Portland, but I won't feed into that.  I'm not here to abuse anybody.  He won't feed into that.  I will not feed into that type of Pendulum propaganda.  Chicanery.  It's chicanery at the highest level. 
[03:41:00]  The Pendulum business is a dirty business, and I won't laugh about it.  Oh, I'm sorry.  That's all right.  I'm sorry to shout.  That's okay.  I hate shouting.  I hate shouting.  The cow patty and the stick.  Yes, they're Pendulums, and they spray paint, and they look just like real Pendulums.  You would know it if you didn't take a bite out of them.  That's how you test it.  Remember, they used to test coins.  They would bite the coin.  That's to make sure it's not shit. 
[03:41:30]  I ain't never...  Wow.  Yes.  Oh, my fucking head hurts.  You don't want to be wrong on that one, do you?  That's a damn good song.  Let's get out of my way.  Pendulum swinging back the other.  Very good.  That's a toe-tapper.  Yeah.  Oh, you're very welcome, Stephen.  I'm a big fan of your work.  Just splat your homosexuality. 
[03:42:00]  I don't care.  I know you don't.  Even though the Bible says it's wrong.  It certainly does.  Funding brought me with you.  You knew that.  Yes.  Perfect.  Here is a runner-up line of the day.  It's like, what's the C word for gay?  What is like...  Oh, oh.  Oh, Carleese.  Oh.  Oh, does Steve take some abuse? 
[03:42:30]  Oh, damn, Steve.  The same fucking abuse.  Yes.  And hysterical every time.  It really is a fucking warmer.  Here's another runner-up line of the day.  There's no reason for it.  How could she provoke that?  I don't know.  It's showing up.  It's in a fucking bikini top.  That was a fucking good line.  Unnecessary brutality.  Absolutely reasonless. 
[03:43:00]  Stands to reason.  I won't have it.  What the fuck is that?  Another runner-up line of the day.  This is actually in Mega Man 9  when you fight homo man.  Nice.  What are we up to?  Homo man.  I like his poor Steve. 
[03:43:30]  We're getting there.  One more runner-up.  My heart's getting heavy.  My blood's getting cold.  You changed me into something  that I just can't control.  If you see me coming,  best get out of my way.  That's my favorite.  Out of my way.  That was really good.  That's my favorite.  I think that was my favorite.  That was good.  All right.  Line of the day time.  Thank you, WebEx.com.  Here. 
[03:44:00]  Cock.  That's savory, Anthony.  Line of the day.  I can't help it.  I love doing that.  It's been impressive.  Doo-doo.  Thievery.  Swing and neck.  The other way.  Someone wrote Peter, Paul, and fairy.  That was the demon phone call, Robert. 
[03:44:30]  Yeah, so someone gets line of the day today.  Yes, somebody.  I apologize.  People at Paul talk know who it was.  Nice.  Congrats.  Very good.  To that guy or girl.  Bless you.  Or gal.  You actually won line of the day.  Wow, this is fun.  Bobby, thank you so much.  Yay!  Such a pleasant, sweet voice.  That's a great job.  I wonder if she's not a fucking pig.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Maybe that's why she's not on the website.  Jesus.  Yeah, hopefully not. 
[03:45:00]  Works at the front desk of a Holiday Inn.  Some fat pig who never made it.  Jesus.  Fucking a sweet voice of love.  She likes to sing in the shower.  She's fucking washing out of rotten, fat cunt flaps.  Folds.  Oh no, we're just being awful about it.  I don't know who she is.  She can't even speak to the best radio.  She's an imaginary person right now.  Exactly.  She's rubbing a loofah on the back of her fat twat lip.  She gave us gold today.  We don't even know if it's her.  We have a pretty good idea, though, you gotta think. 
[03:45:30]  Yeah, she's not on the site.  That's gotta be a fucking problem.  Who is it?  Chris OBX.  Chris OBX.  That's who wound up getting line of the day today.  With that great line.  This is your show, too, people.  Wilbur Theatre.  Robert Kelly will be there Friday.  This Friday night, one show.  One show.  Friday night, Wilbur.  Let's go to Ticketmaster.  Yeah, please.  Please.  Created a fucking monster with Sal, by the way.  Oh my God.  He won't stop with... 
[03:46:00]  He was talking to people.  I was at a wedding on Sunday.  And he was talking to people.  And he's like,  Yeah, this is Anthony.  Because he always does this Opie and Anthony show.  Did you hear it?  It's got...  I got line of the...  Wait, what did I get?  What did I get?  The thing of the day?  Of the week?  Or something?  Like, no.  It's line of the...  Line of the day, Ru.  That's what...  Tell him.  And no one knows...  Unless you know the show,  you don't even know what he's talking about.  At the end of the show,  it's a line.  We got to bring him back in.  Oh, I know.  He won't stop. 
[03:46:30]  He's like,  If you need...  You know,  if Jimmy's not in one day,  I'll sit in.  All right, Sal.  Calm down.  Yeah.  Very cool.  Yeah.  I got stood up on that wedding, too.  What?  Fucking bitches.  Who stood you up?  I don't even want to fucking...  I don't even...  Wait, who got married?  I'm not even going to say,  but I got fucking stood up,  and I'm pissed.  Just coin city itself.  Not even a friend of mine.  Oh.  Oh, no?  You were supposed to have a friend  go to the wedding with you?  Yes. 
[03:47:00]  What happened?  I don't know.  Apparently someone got too intoxicated  and couldn't wake up.  Oh.  Oh, no.  Did somebody's alcoholism...  Yes.  Oh, my God.  Oh.  Affected your alcoholism?  Oh.  Oh.  That's bad news.  You were at the wedding  all about your lonesome?  No.  I hate being stood up.  I went a lot.  I didn't care.  My family was there.  Did you do the chicken dance  by yourself?  I didn't do any chicken dance.  I didn't do anything.  I sat in my seat,  and I drank.  Chicken dance is fun. 
[03:47:30]  I laugh the whole time I do it.  I flap my arms like a chicken.  I even pluck.  No, I just sit there, and...  You ever do the chicken dance  in a wake?  That really bothers me.  Oh, my God.  Especially if it's a child's wig.  That little teeny coffin.  Just to try to cheer the parents up.  That's right.  And then you open the thing, 
[03:48:00]  and you shake the toddler.  Look, he's alive!  I'm so sorry.  That's right.  I try to get the whole family laughing.  I'm like,  light up, you can have another one.  You know, you take his two little hands  and slap them together at that part.  I say he's up there  doing the chicken dance  in the sky with the Lord.  Oh, is that horrible?  Look at him in his little outfit.  He wouldn't be wearing  a little suit.  Yes, he would. 
[03:48:30]  It's his only little suit, though.  I know.  He's only got one.  He was only a little boy.  Four or five.  Kids only wear suits  for one reason.  I always try to tell him.  I always try to spit it in a positive.  At least you save money.  It's a little coffin.  It couldn't have coughed  as much as a big one.  And I flap my arms wildly  like a chicken.  And the parents would never laugh.  They just hear this head  as they wheel that useless bicycle  out on the curb. 
[03:49:00]  An awful song.  It really is.  Especially to do  at a child's funeral.  If I'm fed today,  my throat's going to be suffering.  All right, that's it.  Pre-order to Norton's book,  I Hate Your Guts,  on Amazon.  It's doing very well so far.  The book comes out  in two weeks from today.  But you can get your copy  ahead of time  or at least order it  ahead of time.  Because we do  whatever we want.  It's our channel.  We're playing  The Who The Seeker today  as we leave. 
[03:49:30]  No real good reason.  I just heard the song  in Religious  and I said,  fuck, that's a great song  and I want to hear it again.  So we'll see you guys tomorrow.  We'll see you guys tomorrow. 
[03:50:00]  I've been searching  low and high  I won't get to get  what I'm after  till the day I die  I asked Bobby Dillon 
[03:50:30]  I asked the Beatles  I asked Timothy Leary  But he couldn't  But he couldn't  help me either  They called me  The Seeker  I've been searching  low and high  I won't get to get  what I'm after  till the day I die  People tend to hate me 
[03:51:00]  Cause I never smile  As I ransack their homes  They want to shake my hand  Focusing on nowhere  Investigating miles  I'm a seeker  I'm a really desperate man  I won't get to get 
[03:51:30]  what I'm after  Till the day I die  I learned how to raise my voice  in anger  Yeah, but look at my face 
[03:52:00]  Ain't this a smile  I'm happy when life's good  And when it's bad I cry  I got values  But I don't know how or why  I'm looking for me  You're looking for you  We're looking at each other  And we don't know what to do  They call me The Seeker  I've been searching 
[03:52:30]  low and high  I won't get to get  what I'm after  Till the day I die  Hey, this is Duff McKagan  and you're listening to  Stephen Carr  Lead singer of Foundry  Enroll in the Steve Carlisi School of Improv  Here's one of my students now  Give me a person  an occupation
