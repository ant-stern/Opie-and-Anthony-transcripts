<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast covered a wide range of topics, often transitioning abruptly between them.  The show began with a discussion about a $100 bounty (escalating to $200) for a nude woman to appear on the show, performing a specific act with a cigarette, highlighting the perceived hypocrisy of their corporate policy allowing nude male guests but prohibiting nude female ones.  This was followed by a discussion of their ongoing feud with John Minnelli, a superior, involving satirical responses to his show suggestions and an upcoming meeting.  The hosts then graphically recounted the discovery of producer Derek watching gay pornography at work, providing detailed and humorous commentary on the content.  This transitioned to a discussion of the "Pests Out West" and their sign calling Tyra Banks a "fatty pig fatty,"  along with listener calls and a comedic bit from John and Jeff. Jim Norton was a frequent guest throughout this portion of the show.

The next segment included a humorous montage of E-Rock’s waxing experience (available on YouTube), a scathing critique of Tyra Banks's "homeless experience" segment and perceived hypocrisy, and a disgusted reaction to a Snickers Super Bowl commercial depicting two men seemingly kissing.  The hosts also discussed Giuliani's potential presidential run, the obesity/anorexia dichotomy, and Prince’s Super Bowl halftime show, interpreting a shadow created by his guitar as a phallic symbol.  Ryan and John (a self-identified gay man) called in to offer their perspectives on Tyra Banks and the commercial, respectively.  Steve was mentioned as an on-air staffer.

The show then moved to a discussion of the Janet Jackson Super Bowl wardrobe malfunction, comparing the media's overreaction to the 9/11 coverage.  The bulk of this segment focused on the arrest of astronaut Lisa Marie Nowak for attempting to kidnap a romantic rival, highlighting the humor of the situation and the changing image of astronauts.  "Patty Boy from the Bronx" called in, announcing his intention to snort cocaine on air, resulting in an incoherent exchange.  The hosts then reminisced about past show personalities and segments, brainstorming ideas for a "homecoming week," listing numerous names and incidents.  The segment concluded with audio of a friendly fire incident involving US and British pilots in Iraq, with a caller offering expertise on AWACS planes.  The audio contained numerous expletives.

The show continued with "unbelievable" audio clips seemingly related to a plane incident, featuring angry outbursts and mentions of visiting the families of deceased soldiers.  A call from Mike from Boston followed, detailing a graphic account of hiring a prostitute, referencing Jimmy's influence.  The hosts engaged in highly explicit and vulgar conversation with Mike.  The plane audio returned, followed by a discussion with a painter who was subjected to homophobic and vulgar insults from Anthony.  A sexually explicit board game was then played, involving sexually suggestive cards, trivia, and explicit descriptions of sexual acts.  The hosts and a guest read cards aloud, leading to further explicit and vulgar conversation.  More sexually explicit audio and a recap of the show's sponsor's "lines of the day" concluded the segment. Laura Korn was mentioned as an upcoming guest.

Anthony  I will beat children about the head  Jim Norton  I'm dancing, I'm dancing  I'm just, I'm a naked whore  It's indescribable, I'm trying  It's like a rape that's covered by insurance  Some of the comments they make are uncalled for  Why are you crying?  The virus finally hit him 
[00:00:30]  But with Jimmy, you never know  It could be AIDS  No  Yes, yes  It's the Obi and Anthony show  The virus that spreads from town to town  Across the U.S. today  And  I hate you  But enough of this palaver  Let's get the show on the road  Babababababa  Wagabababababa  Agh обс  Oh, my God. 
[00:01:00]  Look at everyone bopping. 
[00:01:30]  That's terrible. I'm sorry.  Yeah, good morning. Welcome to the Opie and Anthony Show.  That just makes everybody happy, doesn't it?  I was looking around the room and everyone was just bopping their heads.  You have no choice. 
[00:02:00]  Just bopping along to the song.  It's fun. It's Steve.  Yeah, it's the ONA virus spreading across America.  Our phone number, 1-866-313-FREE.  That's 1-866-313-FREE.  Lots of things to get into right away today.  Oh.  Right away.  Are we doing the thing for the $100 today?  Yeah, that's just an open invite.  Anthony's new thing?  Yeah.  Just changing some of the things we do on this radio show? 
[00:02:30]  A little bit.  A little bit, a little bit.  A little bit.  We know cash is the great incentive.  Right.  Here.  And we were kind of at odds with the lawyers and everybody else who, for some reason, has  a problem with naked women.  I don't know what that's all about, huh?  Where do you think that stems from?  Well.  Hmm?  Hmm?  Not saying anything, but speaking volumes is what I'm doing.  Use your imagination.  You've got a problem with nude women, I think something's going on there. 
[00:03:00]  They don't have a problem.  You know what?  They don't have a problem with nude men.  Not nude men.  Everyone Erock was pretty naked yesterday.  Bare ass, as they call us.  Pretty naked yesterday.  Yeah.  But naked women, there's a big problem.  So, um...  You know, yesterday when that was going on, I'm like, wait a minute.  Let me get this straight.  The lawyers that just wreck everything in radio have decided that naked women are going  and women on the radio, bad. 
[00:03:30]  Not allowed to have them in here.  It's a corporate policy.  It has nothing to do with the FCC.  Mm-hmm.  But we did a bit with Erock where he was naked.  Could we have done that same thing with a woman?  No.  No.  They don't like women.  Technically or realistically.  No.  But I'm sitting here thinking to myself, how stupid are these dumb rules?  Very stupid.  We got Erock.  He's completely naked getting waxed yesterday.  By the way, the video's up on YouTube.  It's hilarious.  Starkle.  He screamed like a woman. 
[00:04:00]  It really is hilarious.  But, you know, as far as naked women, they got a problem.  Yeah, they got a problem.  So I figured I'd put a $100 bounty out.  Mm-hmm.  And any woman that comes up takes her clothes off completely.  I don't want one stitch.  If I'm paying, I want to see it the way it's supposed to be.  Pristine.  It's kind of cold in New York, though.  But it's warm in here.  Can't they leave their socks on?  No.  Why?  Because I want to see their feet, too.  What about little?  See if it ruins the picture.  What about little ankle socks? 
[00:04:30]  No.  So they don't get their feet dirty.  Nothing.  I want nothing.  There's something about just completely naked.  So they got to take everything off, not say a word, they don't have to speak, they don't  have to do anything.  This is also proving a point, because it's radio.  It's radio.  It's not television.  So they come in, if they don't say anything, and we don't describe anything that's going  on, not a word, then how could they tell us we can't do it? 
[00:05:00]  So the bounty's open.  The bounty's open.  Okay.  They got a hundred bucks.  Well, yesterday you went for naked girl, completely nude, no socks, no ankle socks.  That's it.  What's today's naked girl bit?  Today?  The naked girl bit of the day.  Because I'd like to go a little further.  Just a little.  With this.  So you want to take us to the next level.  Next level.  I want...  Teenager?  Completely.  No.  We got to keep everything legal.  Although 18 is, and 19 is completely legal. 
[00:05:30]  So we might bring that in the future.  But I'm thinking, again, completely naked woman.  Okay.  Not a stitch.  Takes her clothes off, doesn't utter a word, we don't talk to her, nothing.  Okay.  But she has to do something involving a cigarette.  Okay.  That is not smoked conventionally.  Okay.  That's it.  That's all I'm saying.  That's all I'm saying.  I don't want anyone to elaborate on it or anything.  It's the $100 bit of the day.  $100 bit of the day. 
[00:06:00]  I'll throw in $100 for this one.  $200 then.  Okay.  $100 from you, $100 from me.  I'll buy cigarettes.  Yes.  And Jimmy will buy cigarettes.  Jimmy will buy the butts.  Nice.  Speaking of nudity, what the hell was going on in the office after the XM show?  Oh, it was over at the XM offices facilities?  I went home early.  What's funny is the bosses around here at Free FM, they think we don't show prep.  They think we don't meet.  See, the funny thing is we meet, but we meet over at the other joint. 
[00:06:30]  Yeah, because that's where we are.  That's where we are when the Opie and Anthony show officially ends.  When it ends over there.  And then we hang out and talk about some stuff, just goof around.  Right.  Or run out the door sometimes.  Of course.  It's what we do.  Do production, do, you know, we have things to do.  Well, we are meeting and then figure out stuff for the radio show.  And yesterday I had to get out of there right away and you were waiting for your car and  then I guess all hell broke loose in the office.  Well, first I was in the office watching our own Steve the Bear composing an email, a rebuttal, 
[00:07:00]  if you will, back to John Minnelli.  Oh, yeah, they've been going back and forth.  Oh, it's been entertaining reading in the emails all night long.  All night long.  It's just them just batting it out and it's really funny.  Well, if you weren't listening yesterday because you had to sleep in because of the Super Bowl,  John Minnelli gave us some thoughts, gave us some ideas for the radio show.  Some ideas.  So Steve put them in bullet point form and we read them on the air and really goofed on 
[00:07:30]  them pretty bad.  In O&A fashion, we beat the hell out of them.  We took those ideas and just really, really tooled on them.  I saw one email where John writes Steve and goes, I want to see this list.  I want to see the list you gave the guys because that is not what I said.  It wasn't my intention in any way.  You totally screwed this up.  You wrote down, you know, pretty much telling Steve he fabricated things on this list and  then we went off on him as if John had stated them as fact. 
[00:08:00]  And then Steve tried to save his job saying, well, maybe they exaggerated a bit for the  radio show.  Maybe the boys did.  Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.  And then John writes back, well, that's all well and dandy or whatever the hell he said.  Yeah.  But I still want to see the list.  He goes, that's well and fine, Steve.  I still want to see the list.  Like, oh boy.  People are just in trouble now.  When is management going to realize that they're just punching bags as far as our show goes?  We really, really. 
[00:08:30]  And if your feelings get hurt that easily, then you should go do another job because we're not going to stop.  You're just going to catch it every day.  We enjoy using you as a punching bag.  Yeah.  You're fun to beat up and make fun of.  You're like the retarded.  Steve has the spine.  He's like a marshmallow spine.  I'm not going to take that.  Yes, you are.  I might have to.  I'll take it.  Yeah.  I'll start off.  Dearest John.  So anyway, that was going on yesterday and it continues. 
[00:09:00]  And I guess there's a big meeting with us and John on Wednesday, tomorrow?  Wednesday.  I just kind of blurted out Wednesday while we were reading the bullet points yesterday.  I said, do you want to meet?  We'll meet.  Oh, we're going to meet.  Wednesday.  The OK Corral.  And then John writes, well, they want to meet Wednesday.  Well, we're going to meet Wednesday.  We're going to meet.  Yeah, it was like a, yeah, he responded with, it wasn't kind of a, hey, I'll see you Wednesday kind of thing. 
[00:09:30]  It's like, you want Wednesday?  You got Wednesday.  Wednesday.  So I don't know what to make of this.  It was just like some.  He better dress down.  He better wear like wrap clothes or something because if he wears that conservative, you know, suit jacket and tie, I can't take him seriously.  The Tweed Avengers suit that he wears.  What are you programming?  WMCA?  Back in the day.  Back in the day. 
[00:10:00]  That suit should have Ethel Merman changing behind it.  Are you programming the good guys?  Fred Mertz used to wear down to Ricky's Club.  Got my Tweed suit, Rick.  I just went very local for the New York audience.  But basically, back in the day, the good guys, they all had to wear like suit jackets and thin ties.  That's what radio guys had to wear back in the day, as they call the older times.  If it was John Minnelli with his little jacket and tie, he'd fit right in with the WMCA good guys from back in the day. 
[00:10:30]  Yeah.  So can you tell I'm reading a book on radio, by the way?  All right.  Anyway, go ahead, Ed.  So we were watching Steve compose his little letter to John, which was entertaining.  And then I look over at another computer that Derek is working on.  Derek does a lot of work over there at XM.  And he's on what is called PornoTube. 
[00:11:00]  It is the pornography version of YouTube.  You submit videos, and they're on there.  Although we were noticing yesterday, a lot of it just seems to be advertisements for other websites.  It's not like YouTube, where it's just people submitting videos.  They're pretty much spams of porno.  Yeah.  But he had – there's different categories.  Anyways, a girl, girl, girl, girl, guy, those certain shots that show just a woman's face, all kinds of things. 
[00:11:30]  And then there's gay – man on man, gay.  And I notice he's there.  He's up on that part.  And why was he there, Dan?  What was he doing that – I don't think Derek is a homosexual.  No, I don't think so either.  He was getting audio to mix with Eric getting waxed to make a new piece of production. 
[00:12:00]  Oh, fantastic.  Okay.  Premiering later.  Do we have the waxed audio from yesterday?  Not yet?  It's good stuff.  You got it?  It's coming.  Okay.  Yeah, E-Rock got waxed yesterday, including his armpit hair.  It was terrific.  The audio we got was hilarious.  And so what?  Derek needed gay porn to do what?  He needed some gay porn sound.  I think there's probably a good comparison going on as to how gay gentlemen sound when they're in the throes of passion. 
[00:12:30]  And E-Rock getting hair pulled out of his armpits.  They sound the same, apparently.  So he's watching that, and so we all kind of drifted over to the computer just to realize how funny and silly man-on-man sex is.  It's just –  This is an angle I've never heard of before.  Because, you know, a lot of heterosexual gentlemen don't really sit down and watch gay pornography. 
[00:13:00]  They don't take the time.  They don't take the time out.  Are you suggesting that all the guys out there in Radioland sit down and enjoy some gay porn and laugh and see how silly it is?  Let me suggest this.  If you're confident in your heterosexuality –  Heterosexuality, okay.  And you're with a bunch of your close friends or business associates.  Should they do this at the office today?  At the office. 
[00:13:30]  Okay.  Make sure the boss isn't around.  N-S-F-W.  Not safe for work.  Oh.  That's Internet speak.  All right.  And pop some of that on because, you know, nothing against the gay community.  You know, you want to fall in love.  You want to get married.  You want to raise children.  You want to do anything that people – regular heterosexual straight people do. 
[00:14:00]  God bless you.  I have no problem with whatever the hell you want to do with yourself.  But the ugly truth of the matter is when it comes down to sexuality, it just looks ridiculous.  It is the dumbest looking thing to see two men in the throes of passion.  It doesn't look right.  The sounds are awful. 
[00:14:30]  The positioning is the most awkward, silly thing you'd ever want to see.  One guy's got to like – one guy seems to be getting like all the goodness out of it as far as if you compared it to a male-female relationship.  Where there's goodness for all.  Well, goodness for all because the girl is getting her goodness because of her biology. 
[00:15:00]  I think you could understand that.  And her anatomy.  That's sure.  The girl is getting her goodness.  The guy is getting his goodness because of the same thing, his anatomy, the male anatomy, like that.  So in that way, there's a guy that is also getting goodness because of his anatomy and the basics of the male body.  If you act on certain areas in certain ways, you're going to get a response that is pleasurable.  One guy seems to be in that boat. 
[00:15:30]  You're on the curviest road I've ever seen.  Oh, I'm wailing over here.  Holy crap.  Then there's the other guy who just seems to have to take it.  It's just –  You're basically saying there's nothing in it for him.  It just seems out of what we were watching yesterday, there really is very little in it for him.  And what goodness is in it for him based on basic anatomy, again, is all done – 
[00:16:00]  it's something you could just do in your home by yourself is what he's doing.  And the other guy really not paying much attention to him, just kind of doing what he wants to do.  You're saying it's like a brutal doctor's exam.  Very good.  A brutal doctor's exam where the guy – the doctor could still play Cats in the Cradle because he doesn't need his hands for it whatsoever. 
[00:16:30]  You're saying the other guy –  He could build a card house at the same time.  You're saying the other guy might as well be a couch cushion.  He could play the bongos.  He could do whatever he wants with those unused hands.  He could work on his bills.  Right.  He's got time on his hands.  Exactly.  He's just like –  It's just – it's silly looking, guys.  It's silly.  So we're watching this and just laughing our asses off. 
[00:17:00]  You know what I'm amazed at?  Anthony just made watching gay porn cool.  Well, let's not go that far.  You just made it the in thing.  It was very funny.  I got to tell you, it was very funny to watch because the reactions, too, from everybody in the office was just like,  What's – oh, this collective like, oh, no. 
[00:17:30]  Oh, it was like watching a horror movie.  It was very entertaining and funny.  Just a funny, goofy, silly thing because everything's like –  You see, like, legs.  Let's see.  If you're watching your standard edition guy on girl movie, you will see nice, smooth legs.  And they're in various positions, you know. 
[00:18:00]  You see – you've seen regular movies, I'm sure.  But they're smooth and nice and everything.  You watch this and it's just these hairy, knobby kneecaps and big, ligamenty feet.  And they're just kind of up in the air.  It's just wrong and funny looking.  You can tell he has a knee injury from high school football that never healed. 
[00:18:30]  Maybe the drama class when he fell off the stage.  So you got all this – you got all these observations after watching it for, what, a minute?  Oh, a minute, an hour, whatever it was.  No, we watched for – honestly, it was probably about between five and ten minutes somewhere.  Were you guys just howling?  It was so funny.  And then we hit one where it was just two black guys. 
[00:19:00]  And who did they look like, Stan?  Stan, don't stand over there like you weren't involved.  Who did the black guys look like?  Well, one reference is a little obscure.  It's Noah from Noah's Ark, the gay show.  The gay show on –  The Logo channel.  Logo.  I haven't watched that.  And I had to for this very program.  Of course you did.  Yeah, of course you had to watch it.  And I believe the boss looked like Chris Tucker.  Chris Tucker.  Yeah.  The boss.  There was a moment there. 
[00:19:30]  Because it's silly and goofy and funny enough to watch white guys going at it like that.  But when you see two homies going at it and one of them, the boss, is standing there and the other guy is taking care of business, a little taking care of business, as the boss is just kind of standing up.  And we just kind of went, oh, no.  It looked ridiculous.  It was so silly to watch. 
[00:20:00]  And you're just thinking, this guy's got no street cred.  He would lose all of his street cred if this movie got out.  All right.  Hold on.  Jenny, very pissed off.  What happened?  Up there in Boston listening on WBCN.  Jenny, what's up?  I'm not pissed off.  I'm just wondering if you guys have ever heard of the mutual goodness that involves prostate stimulation for men having sex.  No.  Yeah.  You've never had your prostate stimulated? 
[00:20:30]  No.  I must say, let me tell you something.  I've had exams in a doctor's office so far twice.  My doctor's tried twice as well.  It's a yearly exam, so every two years, that is done to make sure you don't have any prostate problems.  Right.  But let me tell you something.  Okay.  As far as any kind of stimulation or anything that might be pleasurable, that's a no-go. 
[00:21:00]  Just simply for the location of it.  If perhaps the prostate was located in the ear, that would be fine.  A girl could take her pinky, maybe stick it in your ear, and then jiggle it, and the prostate's in your ear.  So that's fine.  Let's say your prostate was under your armpit.  It might be a little ticklish, but if she could just tickle, tickle, tickle.  See, where the good Lord put access to the prostate negates it from being used as any kind of stimuli during any kind of pleasurable experience. 
[00:21:30]  Proving he doesn't want us to have fun.  He does not want that thing touched.  If he really was into sex and the prostate, he would have made it very, very convenient for everybody.  Put it behind the tongue, maybe, or behind that little flappy thing that hangs in your throat.  Maybe some kind of kangaroo pouch.  Right, a pouch.  Around your belly button area.  Where you can then just put your hand on the pouch and give it a little jiggle.  But the fact of the matter is, it's pretty much, the Lord put it in a locked vault that is not supposed to be opened. 
[00:22:00]  Hold on, hold on, hold on, Jenny.  Is it normal during an exam like that to hear the doctor mumbling, say my name?  Sure, doctor.  I know you.  All right, Jenny.  Do you stimulate your girlfriend's G-spot?  That's different.  Yeah.  That's different.  No, no, no.  It's the male G-spot.  I'm telling you.  Yeah.  Let me tell you something.  But I like Anthony's analysis much better. 
[00:22:30]  Let's say the woman's G-spot was in her sinuses behind her nose, and stimulating it was punching her in the face.  I don't think a lot of women would be into the stimulation of the G-spot if that was how it was done.  That's exactly what it's like for a guy.  You're onto something.  It's just not in the right area.  Oh, that was our laugh out, too.  No!  The old man has to be a joke. 
[00:23:00]  No, no, no.  All right, you're on.  Hear what everyone else is talking about.  O&A Uncut and live, continuing the show on XM Satellite Radio, starting at 9 a.m. Eastern.  Visit XMRadio.com to subscribe.  It's the Opie and Anthony Show.  The virus is spreading.  Opie and Anthony!  Ah, we're back with the Opie and Anthony Show.  Good morning.  Hi.  It's cold in New York. 
[00:23:30]  All right, move on.  Everyone knows.  Da, da, da, da.  Ooh.  So, uh...  Is this good for this early in the morning?  Jesus.  What the hell is this music?  Yeah, we might want to mellow it out a little bit.  People are still waking up.  And then by, like, you know, maybe 7.30, we start with this.  Then we can start rocking.  Start with this.  I think some kind of lullaby.  Yeah.  Like a music box.  Bling, ding, bling, ding, bling, ding, bling, ding, bling, ding, ding, ding.  Yeah, that's not appropriate. 
[00:24:00]  Wake up, wake up, wake up  Wash your face, wash your face  Push your teeth on  Alright, alright, I'm up, I'm up  He drives you crazy  You need something a little mellower  And happier  I wake up to John and Jeff  Stan raises his hand  Well I have my clock radio next to me  And of course it is set here in New York  It's set to regular radio  So I put Free FM on 
[00:24:30]  And I wake up to it  You know why?  Because I won't just sit there listening to it  I can't hit the button that shuts it off quickly enough  I'm amazed that these guys are on the radio  It is stunning  I'm amazed  They're the, what they call themselves, the third shift  Yeah, well  I guess it's the overnight, like  You know when everyone's sleeping?  When normal people are sleeping  That's when they work 
[00:25:00]  I guess this is radio for dummies  That's when they're on  Radio for dummies  I just picture somebody  For a sound on the axe  I picture somebody  In front of a black and white television set  Yeah  With the sound turned down  Yeah  With John and Jeff turned up  And they're rocking  In their own feces  With their eyes agape  Just  And it's 3.30 in the morning  And they just don't know what to do with themselves  They've been up for hours  Yeah, it's just like listening to Gene Shepard  Huh? 
[00:25:30]  Huh?  Wow  Oh, okay  The book  Yeah, I'm reading a book  Mm-hmm  He was amazing  Gene Shepard  Was he?  Gotta get prompted  Gene Shepard  Gene Shepard ripped me off  You know what I read in this book?  And I'm not telling you what book  Gene Shepard  Why someone's gonna get it  And slow down your reading?  It's not the internet  Gene Shepard  Howard likes to tell everyone  That he invented  Who, who, you know  Talk radio  But it goes way back  To people like Gene Shepard 
[00:26:00]  One of the first  Talk show hosts  That wasn't talking about  The news and politics  Just a guy to hang out with  Yeah  You know  One of your pals on the air  Yeah, exactly  You know  From network  I'm mad as hell  And I'm not gonna take it anymore  Shouting from the windows  Gene Shepard used to kind of do that  Every night  But he would do other things  He would tell his listeners  To put the radio up  Against the window  And turn it up real loud  And then he would yell  Crazy things for the city of New York  Please hold  It's not wacky 
[00:26:30]  Because it happened in what?  Maybe today it would be wacky  But we're talking  What year was Gene Shepard  On the radio?  The early 60s  Somewhere isn't there maybe?  Early 60s  There was a radio back then?  Maybe mid  I don't know  My God, man  But he's one of the pioneers  Of what we do today, Anthony  What we do today  I know it's great  The radio station  He worked for at the time  Didn't want to like  Open up the studio at night  For his stupid overnight babble  Yeah  So they made him broadcast his show  From the transmitter in a hut 
[00:27:00]  A hut  I guess there was  By the stick  No, I guess there was like  A little shed  Yeah, there's usually sheds  By those transmitters  For the engineers  You know, the transmitters  They go out there  So they can check their meters  And they have to fiddle  With all the knobs  Right, Jimmy?  A lot of fiddling going on  At the transmitter  Yeah, the engineers  Go out there to fiddle  And make sure everything's right  And I guess they had  A little shed  And  Could he just plug a microphone  Into a wire?  Magic said, look  Splice it  We don't want to open up 
[00:27:30]  The radio station  In the middle of the night  Because we don't think  Anyone listens to the radio  During the third shift  Well  But  We will allow you  They had something there  We will allow you  To do your show  From their shed  At the transmitters  Somewhere in the  In the swamps of Jersey  In the Middlelands there  Why can't  John and Jeff  Do their show  From the top of  The Empire State Building  Then  Wherever our transmitter  Well, John and Jeff  Just like  Gene Shepard  My God  We got the  John and Jeff  Bit of the day 
[00:28:00]  Okay  By the way  We're in a lot of cities  And  Unfortunately  A lot of these cities  Don't have  The privilege  Of having John and Jeff  On the airwaves  Hopefully that'll change  They're on before us  Here in New York  They're on in L.A.  They're on I think  Before us in Chicago  And  I got  Really  I hope Boston  Wasn't stupid enough  To pick up the  John and Jeff show  Stupid enough  If Boston  Is stupid enough  To call out the  Bomb squads  The light brights  I'll tell you  Who was stupid enough  Ready  Us in New York 
[00:28:30]  Chicago  Stupid enough  To have the  John and Jeff show  On their airwaves  San Francisco  Of course  And  That is  About  It  So here is  Today's  John and Jeff moment  Listen  And laugh  Along  It's quick  Look out for yourself  It's almost like  What the flight attendants  Say  During a  You know  The safety  Instructions  Before they leave  Put on your  Seatbelt first  And your oxygen  Mask first  Before you put  Your kids 
[00:29:00]  Mask on first  In other words  Save yourself first  Before your kid  And you know  What's really odd  Jeff about these  Pre-flight  Announcements  Is when they  Refer to  A water landing  Don't you mean  A water crash  Every flight attendant  Says in the event  Of a water landing  No  If you hit the water  You're crashing  Yeah all of a sudden  A little flotation  Device  The one you're sitting on  Really the piece 
[00:29:30]  Of the chair  Ain't gonna mean squat  Because once you hit  It lights out  It's like cement  There's gonna be  Pieces everywhere  And that damn  Little flotation  Device  Damn  Stupid little balloon  Thing that comes out  The side of the plane  Ain't gonna mean squat  In case of a  Water landing  Please go to  Your nearest exit  By then you'll be  Dead  Wow  Just like Gene  Shepard 
[00:30:00]  Wow  Does anybody remember  Last year  Wow  Oh dear lord  Indeed  What cornwall  What cornwall  That um  That's probably  One of the  Hackiest bits  I think that  First was done  The second  Like the Wright brothers  Landed their  Little aircraft  I think that  Material started  Coming out  How about that  Airplane huh  They had nothing  To eat so the one  Had a little pack  Of peanuts  This is for the other  And he goes  What is with these 
[00:30:30]  Little pack of peanuts  Farville  Give me a peanut  An open mic  Or wouldn't even  Try that bit  No  It's awful  Hey which is  Which is which  I know  That hurt  I'm sorry  Stan knows  I love them  Alright  And this is the one  We made  Yeah so then  John Minnelli  You know  We beat these guys  Up on a regular basis  And John Minnelli  Decided that  To make a promo  That shows that  We're endorsing  These guys 
[00:31:00]  Yeah  We wanted it  To be  Kind of  If you wanted  To cull  Our show  For promotional  Material for  John and Jeff  You know  Play it straight  Play with the way  We talk about the show  We think it stinks  Right  Don't put it together  In a way that makes  It sound like  We like it  Or you can put it  Together in a way  That sounds like  We like it  But it's so  Over the top  And badly edited  That you would know  That it's spliced together  Right  Badly  Yeah this affects 
[00:31:30]  Our cred man  Our cred  Our cred  We have cred  Of any type  Of course we do  We have crud  We have been  Late nights  2-8-6-A  It's the John and Jeff show  Now endorsed  By Opie and Anthony  It's two guys  Out of L.A.  And they're nice  I enjoyed the program  Oh god  They're terrific  John and Jeff  What they call  The spice of life  I get it  Very nice  John and Jeff  Just very sweet  Qualified to give people  Advice  Yeah absolutely  There are some mornings  I cannot turn that off  It's so funny 
[00:32:00]  John and Jeff  It's so funny  Late nights  2-6  Funny  Now O&A approved  You gotta listen  92-3  Free FM  See most people  That's not sarcastic  Most people  That listen to the radio  They don't listen closely enough  To realize that  That's a goof  They think it's the real deal  That we actually like  Their program  That's some endorsement  And then you would tune in  That program and go  Why  Why  Why do my radio heroes  Like a show like this  They like that  And we don't like that  So we made our own promo  Sounds a little different 
[00:32:30]  Just a dab  Free FM  Late nights  2-8-6-8  It's the John and Jeff show  Browned upon by  Opie and Anthony  One of them sounds  Kind of gay  And the other one  Visits Thailand  John and Jeff  Just  Stank  In my opinion  They sound like fruits  People that go to Thailand  Are kid touchers  They're awful  If there is  A gay sound  That is it  It's crap  John and Jeff  It's crap  Late nights  2-6  When the rest of the world  Is sleeping  92-3 
[00:33:00]  Free FM  That's much better  That's way better  So anyway  You wake up to  John and Jeff  Because it gets you  Out of bed real fast  It makes me hit the alarm  Real quick  Like I can't get to it  Fast enough  Because I really  Don't want to hear  More than just  Two words  To wake me up  I don't want to know  What they're talking  About at all  Because then  I'll just get angry  Yeah  Know what I wake up  To every morning  One of those 
[00:33:30]  Yeah  Because that's much  More pleasing  Than actually  Waking up  For a radio station  To them  Alright  Moving on  The pests  Out west  Yes  The POWs  The POWs  Are calling themselves  Yeah  They're getting a lot  Of print today  A lot of print  The guy who did this  Was on the phone  For an hour and a half  Yesterday  We never got to him  Oh what skanks we are  Why didn't we  Why didn't we pick up  The phone  Because we were too busy  Beating up management  We were too busy 
[00:34:00]  Broadcasting from the bathroom  Because they're suggesting  A smaller surrounding  Would make the  Opie and Anthony show better  Well that isn't what  John told Steve  What  That was another one  Of the little issues  That John had with Steve  He did not say that  He didn't say that  He didn't mean that  The fact that  You were on a stage  That we talked about yesterday  How this huge studio we have  And the way it's set up  This is how Steve  Presented John's information 
[00:34:30]  Steve was the middle man  He said  That this big studio  Is less intimate  Maybe a smaller studio  Would be more intimate  And that Opie  Seems to be on a stage  Sometimes then  Leaving me and Jim  Out as peripheral players  Feeling left out  Feeling left out  Is what the word  The best part of yesterday's show  Is when I demanded  A spotlight on only me  Yes  On only you  And then turned all the  Other lights off in here  I couldn't even see you guys  Of course  Jimmy had to have a flashlight 
[00:35:00]  So I could see when he wanted to talk  Yeah  And Anthony got a lighter  And the email  That John sent Steve  Was just  That it was completely wrong  He did not understand  The meaning of what he was saying  And that some of it  Was just kind of  This sarcasm  He was kidding about some things  And Steve didn't pick that up  And presented it to us  As serious  You know what though  It works for Gene Shepard  What did  Gene Shepard  Gene Shepard  Gene Shepard was broadcasting 
[00:35:30]  His third shift  From a shed  A small shed  Oh intimate  And some fine radio  Came out of that shed  Back in the day  Is there heat in the shed  And I know John Minnelli  Is a historian of radio  So he might be on to something  Because he inherited his tie  From Gene Shepard  That's what Gene Shepard  Gave him when he died  In 1999  Yeah reading the book  Sorry  Oh he  Yeah he passed in 1999  Shame  A radio legend  Anyway go ahead  That's the reason why  This guy was on hold  For an hour and a half yesterday 
[00:36:00]  Yeah yeah  We never got to him  Because we were bitching  And the guy was very excited  And his little sign  Made defamer.com  Little  D-E-F-A-M-E-R dot com  It was a professional sign  By the way  Great sign  We're used to the dopes  Here in New York  That scribble something  On cardboard  These pests out west  They're on to something  Professionally printed sign  Like you'd see  Hanging over a street  That says  Church Bazaar  This Sunday  Sure  You got no filter  Paul  I think he makes his signs 
[00:36:30]  With crayons or something  And then you got  These guys out west  They're doing it  The right way  So the sign  Made defamer.com  It also made  Perez Hilton dot com  Which is a  Huge gossip website  And the headline  Is this  Tyra Banks plotting  Appropriately outraged  Response to hostile  Signage  Plotting  And we'll never learn  By the way  Because the picture  I'm holding in my hand  Is a huge sign  On the hedges  Outside of the  CBS studios  In LA  Yes 
[00:37:00]  CBS  Don't we work for CBS  Yes we do  So the sign is on the hedges  Never learned  Out there in LA  Where she tapes her  According to one of the  Websites  Her Oprah Winfrey  Rip off show  Oh  And the sign says  Opie and Anthony  P.O.W.  And the sign reads  Tyra Banks is a  Fatty pig fatty  It's just amazing  Fatty pig fatty  Oh is that great  I think the sign is also  Up on opieandanthony.com  Right Steve 
[00:37:30]  Okay  I owe 500 bucks  To somebody  Wow  Yeah  That's  Yeah  You do actually  Isn't that great  How we just open our mouths  And have to dump out  Loads of cash to people now  Because we  We don't think anyone  Would actually do this  I know  We want to sound cool  Like yeah I'll give you  500 and then  Oh what  They did it  I know yesterday  When I got home  My girlfriend said  She goes  How many hundreds  Did you have to deal out  Yesterday  I said two  Well a hundred  For the naked girl  Yeah 
[00:38:00]  And maybe  The other naked girl  There were two yesterday  Oh yeah  Two naked girls  The one came in  And disrobed  And then the other one  Came in  She disrobed  We didn't make her  Disrobe as much  Because it was kind of like  Eh who cares  Yeah  But she still got her money  She was kind of chunky  And she was a little chunky  Around the bottom end  We didn't want to see it  Nah  I like the fact that  You're renegotiating  By how they look  Of course  Yeah now it's like  But they still get the same  You know price  But if we want to see it or not  Meh  You have a bunt  Hand back 20 
[00:38:30]  Yeah  So  But today  Looking for another girl  To come in  Just get completely naked  Because we're not allowed  To have naked girls in  And I want to  I want to show  How ridiculous that is  It's not an FCC rule  It's a corporate policy  So a girl comes in  She just takes all of her clothes off  Every stitch  Doesn't see  Doesn't utter a word  Because that's what they're worried about  That someone's going to describe something  Or say something  Because why else  Would they not want  A naked girl  In a radio station  Because it's not television 
[00:39:00]  It's radio  So if they don't talk  We don't describe anything  They just come in  We turn around  They stand against that back wall  Disrobe like it's some kind of  A prison thing  And then hand them $100  And they leave  Put their clothes back on  And leave  But see yesterday  You did the naked girl thing  So we're up in the ante today  The naked girl bit of the day  Is once again Anthony  It's a girl comes down  Yeah  She takes every stitch of clothes off again  And then smokes a cigarette  In a very unconventional manner 
[00:39:30]  Say no more  Say no more  There's no reason to say any more  That's all I'm saying  And that's all anyone is saying  By the way  During the break  Travis was talking to a girl  That's thinking about it  So we'll see  On the way to work  Yeah  PerezHilton.com  So they have a picture of this sign  A love note to Tyra Banks  And then the caption here  Is this lovely message  Was brought to you by  The shock jock radio DJ duo  Of Opie and Anthony  Who placed a sign  Outside of the studio  Where Tyra Banks 
[00:40:00]  Shoots her cheap  Oprah imitation talk show  So there you go  The pest out west  Out west got the job done there  And it's also on  Defamer.com  That's great man  Bravo  And  Given Banks  Recent defiance  In responding to those  Who might make it  An issue  Of her post modeling figure  We wouldn't be too surprised  If she allowed the sign  To stay up a little longer  At least until her staff  Can erect a bigger one  Reading  Kiss my fat ass  On the building behind it 
[00:40:30]  Ah yes  The empowerment  Of striking back angrily  Yeah  Fatso  There you go  So uh  Fatso  A big bravo  To the pest out west today  The fat insult  Of the ages  That will never not be  Funny  Appropriate  And timely  Fatso  It's been around forever  It trumps anything  Intellectual you can say  I remember  Watching the honeymoon  It's  Hey get a little  Fatso there  Fatso 
[00:41:00]  All it is  Is he's so fat  It's just so fat  Reverse  So fat  Fatso  That's all it is  Kiss my fat ass  You go Tyra  You're still a fatso  Kiss my fat ass  She's crying  Ew  Was she crying  When I said that  Yeah she was totally crying  It kind of takes away  From the empowerment  From the you really don't care  If you're weeping  That you have to say that  She didn't want to say it 
[00:41:30]  Have an Oreo  It'll match your hair  Stupid  Kiss my fat ass  Okay  Wonderful  Why not  Kiss my fat ass  Why not  Let's talk to Doug  Out Doug  Doug what's going on today  What's up boys  Hey Doug  Hey give props to the  Pest Out West  First of all  Hey this is just the beginning  Yeah  What we did was  We heard the sound 
[00:42:00]  In your voices  When you were frustrated  About the ratings  But what we did  Instead of laying back  And bitching and moaning  We turned around and said  This is what we're gonna do  We're bringing the pests  Back in full force  Okay  We've broken up the country  In the four areas  You got the pests  Out west  You got the pests  In southern states  We got a guy in Chicago  That's obsessed with you guys  Being number one in Chicago  Okay  We are gonna completely  Bring back  All the things 
[00:42:30]  That make us  The absolute idiots  That we are  With you guys  Over the top  Now Doug  Here's the deal  You gotta  A  Keep it fair  Keep it fair  And make sure  There's humor involved  What makes that sign great  Out there in LA  Outside the CBS studios  Is the fact that  They didn't say  You're a big fat pig  They said  Fatty pig fatty  That is funny  That's really funny  That's what makes it funny  Of course  We don't  And it gets the point across  Yeah  Humor  Humor over mean spirited 
[00:43:00]  In general  Although there  There is opportunities  For mean spirit  Oh please  Depending on the situation  So  I'd say fatty pig fatty  Covers humor  And mean spirited  In a very equal fashion  Exactly  I see nothing but humor  With the term fatty pig fatty  I don't think she does  I'm sorry  So do you mean humor  Over mean spiritedness  As far as we're concerned  Or the person  That it's targeting  Because I don't think  She sees any distinction  Between that  And hey  Tyra  You're a fat slob  We're uh 
[00:43:30]  As far as we're concerned  Oh okay  I don't see any meanness  In fatty pig fatty  I just don't  I don't either  Kiss my fat ass  Yeah whatever  Yeah whatever  Kiss my fat ass  Yeah whatever  Kiss my fat ass  Yeah whatever  Kiss my fat ass  Yeah whatever  What?  Oh sorry  We're doing a radio show  Alright we'll take  Doug anything else?  Yeah if we  If we could just get  A little bit of help  We're going to start  Doing grassroots stuff

[00:57:00]  Hey uh  We got E-Rock audio  In case people  Weren't listening  To the end of the show  Uh  What  He's screaming  Yeah  And the video's  Up on YouTube  Not even  Weren't listening  Some of it  Was dumped out of  Because he  He was cursing  He was potty mouth  Oh  We threw a couple  Bleeps in  Yeah  And then we'll do  The unedited version  For the XMers  A little later this morning  Later on  But basically  E-Rock lost a bet  That he was never  Supposed to win  By the way  Uh  We just wanted  To wax him  To abuse him  And uh 
[00:57:30]  We were gonna go  With the Brazilian wax  And we realized  That he's a smooth boy  So that wasn't  Gonna do anyone any good  So we decided  To um  Uh  Wax his  Armpit hair  In the end  Via various parts  Of his body  That were a little  Hairier  Chest  Chest  Chest  Armpit  Armpit  I believe  Yeah  Is the combination  You're about to hear  How did that work out  For him yesterday  Because uh  Grab a mic there  E-Rock  I know  With the Brazilian wax  Part of the thing  That is  The part of 
[00:58:00]  A woman's body  Usually  Where they will wax it  So that when they wear  One of those Brazilian  Um  G-strings  Nothing  Unruly  And unwily  Kind of shows  You know  You know  They gotta remove that  Uh  So they took  Uh  One of those little  Tongue depressors  Put this honey wax  On it  Which isn't like  Candle wax  It's very  Very sticky  And then  Applied it to that  Area  Um  And then  We told her  Not to remove it 
[00:58:30]  So he had to  Walk around all day  With this honey wax  All over his bottom  When did you finally  Uh  Get  Get rid of it  And how did you  Get rid of it  Yeah  How'd you get it off  Um  As soon as the show  Was done  I went home  Um  You can't use soap  And water  To get it off  So I had to  Lather in  Neosporin  So you had to  Soak yourself  In Neosporin  Just sit in a tub  Like a rape victim  Just curled up  Crying  Holding his knees 
[00:59:00]  And if you were  Finally able to  Peel it apart  Um  Yeah  Then you wash it off  And then you have to  Apply it again  Afterwards  Because um  Apparently you break out  In little red bumps  Good for you  Oh that sounds horrid  Yeah  I'm so happy  Alright  Let's hear his uh  His howls of delight  Anthony you know what  I believe this is  Sort of a montage 
[00:59:30]  Montage  Of uh  E-Rock  Getting waxed yesterday  And by the way  The video is just  Classic  It's up on YouTube  Already  Just throw  Opie and Anthony  In the search engine  And throw uh  E-Rock waxing  What's the  What's the thing  Uh  By date or something  So you get the latest  Oh really  You figure that by date  Yeah  Alright here's E-Rock  From yesterday  Ah  Oh hey  Oh hey  Whoa  Wait a minute

[01:01:00]  We need to take this  Because it's only 50 seconds  And make this into a video  Because the version we got up there  Is like five minutes long  You get just a montage  Montage  Of this on YouTube  Yeah  Just you know  Boom boom boom  Yeah it's got to be quick  I think it will get some hits  Maybe give that to Sam  And see what he can do with that  YouTube videos have to be short  Yeah  Under two minutes  No one has attention anymore  That's it  Under two minutes  Everybody out there has ADD  They lose me  Over a minute for me  As far as videos go  All right 
[01:01:30]  Ah  We'll get into some other things  That I'm not allowed to tease  Because that would be stupid  Other things  That would be stupid  To actually tease something  Let me know when you guys  Are ready to go to break  Because I have a Lulu  Oh  Oh he's prepared  Yeah  No rush  See Steve conveyed to us yesterday  That John Minnelli  Our program director  Said that we shouldn't  Tell people that we're going to break  He said  What we gotta do  Is when something funny is said  And we're ready to go to break  Just go 
[01:02:00]  Just go  That's it  Steve is great  Because he'll like  Try to maintain  The power place dignity  As he's backing down  Oh yeah  You know  We're absolutely unbending on that  Well if you don't do it  You're fired  Well I kind of feel  That that is the right move anyway  So we're happy to do this  We're almost ready to go to break  I concur  Trying to make this sound natural  We're kind of ready to  Go to  You know  Yeah you know  I remember when I was in high school  My teacher told me 
[01:02:30]  I had to be an astronaut  And you know  She said I should be one  Because I just take up a lot of space  Ha ha ha  It's the Opie and Anthony show  The Opie and Anthony virus  Oh we got caught with our mouths full  Well thank you 
[01:03:00]  As we're going to the music  The reason that they're even reporting on this  Is because no one else is bashing her  No one else is just saying  When a self-obsessed swabs you  Yeah we're a little distracted  The Tyra Banks thing  It's got legs  It made Best Week Ever TV  Or BestWeekEver.TV  US Weekly  PerezHilton.com  TheFamer.com  It's going viral  Our little sign  That we put up there in LA 
[01:03:30]  Oh the POWs  The Opie and Anthony POWs  Has erected a sign  That says Tyra Banks  Is a fatty pig fatty  And the media is picking up on it  All over the place  And they're saying  We're just slobs  And we're just asses  For doing this  Alright  Which is fine  On Best Week Ever  It was  That was pretty positive  They're saying it was a little harsh  But she needs her face slammed  Pretty much  Yeah I said she needs to be kicked off  Her golden pedestal  No one's giving this  This woman any crap 
[01:04:00]  About what she talks about  And what she does  And that  She's so pompous  That whole episode she did  Where she was  One of the homeless  Where she dressed up like a homeless person  And went out on the street  Yeah  She had a camera crew with her  You know she had bodyguards  And she didn't even commit  To where she was gonna  Actually spend the night  And sleep  She laid down on the ground  And said  This is where they sleep  And then she laid down 
[01:04:30]  And then got up  For like maybe 15 minutes  Just to get a good camera angle  And then she left  That was it  Her self importance bugs us  That's why I'm very happy  With the sign today  She's a phony man  It's like how does anybody  Not know  At least Oprah has some  Depth to what she does  Although I don't enjoy her show  But this is just a  Disgusting  Spoiled emotionally phony  Yeah  I'd still like to sleep  Enough with her  I said  Wouldn't mind tearing off  That blonde weave  Horsetail wig  Whatever it is  Who knows  See the nap underneath 
[01:05:00]  Funny blonde hat she wears  Yeah  But the sign is  It's  It's  It's everywhere  As far as  Hollywood gossip goes  Yeah all the gossip columns  Gossip  We're in the gossip columns  And this one  I guess it's  Bestweekever.tv  It says  Though we would like to  Though we would like to warn  Open Anthony  That while the world  Might see you looking like this  And there's one of our  Publicity photos  When we first came back  On radio 
[01:05:30]  After our St. Pat's incident  Tyra Banks sees you  Looking like this  And it takes our heads  From our publicity photo  Yeah  And it puts it on a hamburger  And a hot dog  Cause she's gonna eat us  For lunch  No it said eat us  For breakfast  Which is odd  Oh okay  It said eat us  For breakfast  But then they showed  A burger  And hot dog  Yeah it was from  Bugs Bunny cartoon  And uh  Well that's why  Maybe that's the problem  She's eating hot dogs  And hamburgers  For lunch  That's why she's getting  A breakfast  What a fool  Kiss my fat ass 
[01:06:00]  What  Sorry  She's all cheering her up  You go girl  Kiss my fat ass  She's so full of emotions  She needs to be carried out  Like  Pepperoni pizzas  Officer and the gentleman style  Yeah by three strong people  Carry that big  El slobo out  Lug that elephant  On the stage  El slobo  She's heavier than I am 
[01:06:30]  She should be shot  How are you a fashion model  Heavier than me  Alright so  Like I said  A little distracted  Cause it's going viral  This picture  That they erected  Out there in LA  The Opie and Anthony  P.O.W.  Yeah good work  Alright  In other news  Giuliani  He's making a run  For the White House  Woohoo  Yeah  Eh good luck  I don't think so  But  Again  Why don't you think so  In middle America  Again 
[01:07:00]  I just don't see it happening  He's uh  He's a progressive  Yeah  Guy  He's uh  Kind of moderate  As far as Republicans go  He's um  Pro-choice  Uh  He's uh  Not uh  Anti-gay  That's for sure  And uh  Middle American  Republicans don't want  A guy like that  They want the  You know  Morality thing  He's been divorced  Twice  They don't like that  They need somebody 
[01:07:30]  With good morals  What  Do you know  The best president  Might be somebody  That was divorced  A couple of times  Or you know  Uh  Might have a skeleton  In their closet  Or something  Might have smoked a joint  At a sorority house  Back in the day  Yeah  But uh  For some reason  These guys all want  This perfect  Unattainably perfect  Gentleman  In the White House  That is not only  Uh  Wise  But has always been wise  Has always made the right decision 
[01:08:00]  Never made a mistake  And um  Uh  Has a full head of hair  Yeah  Well don't  Don't you  Don't you think  That creepy  Uh  The perfect people  Creep you out  What do you mean  Like uh  Like uh  Like the  Like you said  They want  This perfect individual  Yeah  That  Perfect people  Creep me out  Because I'm  I'm thinking  They're hiding  Some horrific  Oh there's something  Hiding  That's the only reason  They appear to be perfect  Is because they're  Hiding something  And and  Usually  If you have to hide it 
[01:08:30]  It's something so awful  That you can't let it out  And it's usually uh  Involves kids  Let's go to Ryan  In Jersey  He uh  He's got something  On the tire thing  Ryan  Ryan what's up  Hey how's it going guys  Hey  Yeah in that homeless episode  That you were talking about  I don't know if you had seen  That they brought her  Into a convenience store  And gave her a couple of dollars  To buy all the amenities  That a normal person  Would use to wash with  So she was freaking out  Because she didn't have  Enough money for a toothbrush 
[01:09:00]  Toothpaste  And a bar of soap  Yeah  And then when they put her  In the bathroom  She put on this whole  Fake crying thing  And made the cameras leave  Because she couldn't bear  To wash her entire body  In a sink  And brush her teeth  Yep I remember that one  She couldn't bear  She was so depressed  At the fact that she  Panhandled this money  She bought some toiletries  And then she was  In a gas station bathroom  Having to use them  And wash up  And she was crying  And sent the camera crew away  That's because 
[01:09:30]  She didn't use it  I don't know how many homeless people  Are brushing their teeth  Yeah that's the thing too  If they're panhandling for money  This Tyra  What a load of crap she is  Like they're panhandling  For toothpaste and soap  We talk to the homeless people  A lot more than this idiot does  We know what they do  With their money  If they want soap  And toothbrushes  And toothpaste  They go to the church  The church  Doles this crap out  To them on a daily basis  Food  Clothing  That's what they give them  When they're panhandling for money 
[01:10:00]  It's usually for drugs  And booze  Exactly  99% of the time  Drugs and booze  Yeah without a doubt  Not soap  At a convenience store  They're going in there  Buying  Excuse me  Can I have some soap  I'd be like  How do you make drugs  Out of soap  I'd want to know  Because there's no way  You're using this to wash with  And Tyra could earn money  If she was homeless  In a much easier way  Than most homeless men  Oh please  I'd throw her a few bucks  Get that fat ass  In the back of my caddy  She'd be from homeless 
[01:10:30]  To where she is now  In a matter of a week  Yep  Just selling that  Sell that air  Alright  Thank you Ryan  Alright have a good one  We're trying to find the audio  From that episode  Because it is terrific  So Giuliani  Yeah  You say no way  I say no way  Same reason  Obama  Obama  You've already said no way  Same reason Hillary  Hillary already said no way  So who's going to be  The next president  Of the United States of America  According to Anthony Cumia  I don't think  They want a  Itrallian in there either  You know 
[01:11:00]  I don't think they want  Giuliani  President Giuliani  Well what about Edwards  I mean he's just going about it  The right way  Edwards is  Saying how he's going to  Raise taxes  A douche bag  This guy  You know something  You know something  It's wide open right now  So what does he do  To wreck it  He goes well  I'll raise taxes  He says he's going to  Raise taxes on the rich  Which is just the way  To cater  And pander  To the lower  And lower middle class  I don't see that 
[01:11:30]  Working out for him  To tell you the truth  Last candidates  That really were admitting  They were going to raise taxes  Were Moynihan and Ferraro  And they did well  Against Reagan  49 states to one  What was the one state again  It wasn't even his home state  I don't know  They got such a whipping  I could have won one state  There was one state  That might have voted for me  Alone  Jimmy Norton  One state  It had to be like Rhode Island  I would guess  It wasn't California  A ridiculous state  Just one of those states  That shouldn't even be a state  Sorry Providence  I know we're broadcasting  In Providence today 
[01:12:00]  But look how silly  Your state is  It's tiny  I don't know  I think  It's too  Wide open right now  They gotta whittle  These guys down  Maybe some other  Guy will  Throw his hat in  As they say  Throw his hat in  But I don't know  I don't think  It'll be Giuliani though  Good luck  Alright  Getting back to the  Bring up his health  Who cares  It's just the president  Of the United States  We got Tyre audio  Tyre reacts very emotionally  To her experience so far  As a homeless person 
[01:12:30]  This is the clip  We're talking about  When I was walking  Through the streets  I wasn't just seeing  Homeless people anymore  I was seeing stories  And that all of these people  Have a story  As to why they got there  And it was hard  For me sitting there  Doing the panhandling  And being ignored like that  Because I'm that person  That ignores those people  That are asking for money  This was just a glimpse  Of what homeless people  Have to go through every day  I was heartbroken 
[01:13:00]  It'd be nice  If you guys could just  Leave for a second  Just give me a little time  Let me just go  I was about to lose it  Because I was like  How can we be so blind  To these people  Who live like this  Every day  She is  Such a load  Of crap  She's a lying  Sack of sea  She is the worst  What is she doing now?  She's the worst actress  Out there  Yeah  She's acting badly  At least we'll openly admit  We do horrific things 
[01:13:30]  To get our names  Out there  And get ratings up  Absolutely  But she does it  Under the guise  That she's actually  Helping people  She's just doing this  Crap to get ratings up  And make believe she cares  I bet you she hasn't  Even paid attention  To the homeless  Since she did this show  Is there any way  To find out  What she's done  For the homeless  Since this show  She was so affected  By it  That she's crying  In a gas station  Bathroom  There's only one reason  I would like to see her  Crying in a gas station  Bathroom  Some guy coming out  Pulling his fly up 
[01:14:00]  Two fives  Two fives  And a couple of singles  On the bathroom floor  I need a moment  Yeah you need a moment  Tiss my fat ass  Alright I'm sorry  I'm sorry  I'm sorry  I guess we hit a nerve there  We better move on  Do you use your tongue  Purdy or a $20 whore  Tiss my fat ass  Oh well  So she's so taken by this 
[01:14:30]  And upset  That she must  It must have changed her life  That's like  That's  If you were a real person  That upset about something  That's life changing  Upset  That's being upset  To the point  Where you're now  Going to change  Your life  And do something  About this  What has she done  She gets so upset  About every cause  On her show  To the point  Where she's weeping  And what does she do  About it  Next show  Panty party 
[01:15:00]  Panty party  Woo  The negro  What  Oh that was  Panty party  I was trying to do  The panty party again  Yeah you would think  She would like  Quit her TV show  At this point  Cause she's got  More important things to do  She got in trouble  Out on the streets  Yeah  Oh help me  Help me  Help me  Yeah  Then the camera crew  Jumped in  Yeah  Oh god  She's such a bad actress  Too  I was  So upset 
[01:15:30]  Well here we go  Tyra  Why not  We got two quick clips  Tyra's  Tyra's feet  Tyra's feet hurt  Then she finds food  In a dumpster  Good for her  My feet  My feet started to hurt  Like they have never  Hurt before  This is a bra  That wears high heels  On a runway  On the cut walk  And she wants us  To believe  That her feet hurt  From being on  On the streets  For a couple hours  For a couple of hours  Are you kidding me  It was a couple hours  I don't even think  It got to night time 
[01:16:00]  Right  It really didn't  She was laying down  Make believing  She was making believe  She was asleep  And it was  It was still light out  Are you kidding me  She knew  Commit to the darkness  My feet started to hurt  Like they have never  Hurt before  And I only had a few  Cookies to eat that day  So I was feeling  Really physically  And emotionally  No kidding  Because you need  Burgers and hot dogs  For breakfast  I think your old pig  Oh had some cookies  Cookies yeah  I'm going to have  A celery stalk  You pig 
[01:16:30]  This is my fat ass  Oh wow  They're probably  Big cookies too  Like the type that you get  When you check into the  One of those hotels  That give you a cookie  When you check in  Oh  A nice warm cookie  I don't know  The big cookie  Thank god  I was able to live  Like a camel does  Off his humps  Off of my big fat ass  While we're walking  We passed a trash bin  Full of food  And at that moment  I knew that  If I was truly homeless  I would have eaten  That food out of that bin 
[01:17:00]  I would have  Yeah  I almost did  If I  And if  I almost did it  What the hell  Is she talking about  If I was homeless  And I was hungry  I'd probably eat that  That's true  Look guys  I came close  I tell ya  If you were really homeless  And really hungry  You would have resorted  To prostitution  You'd have made yourself  Some money  And you'd have been able  To buy some food  You would have been eating  Some fine steak  Hopefully a pimp  Would have punched out 
[01:17:30]  Your front teeth  False teeth  Because she got mouthy  Tried to yell  Panty party  And some Haitian  Just knocked her teeth out  Get my fat ass  Spend a few dollars  Buying some cookies  Didn't hand it all over  To her man  Those big black and white cookies  Oh yeah  Just like her  I knew that  If I was truly homeless  I would have eaten  That food  Out of that bin  That would have been  My lunch  Maybe my dinner  Maybe my breakfast  All three meals  What about snacks 
[01:18:00]  This is this  Yeah this  Alright well  She's talking with  A real homeless person  That wasn't even  Homeless anymore  What?  She was talking to  A homeless person  That wasn't homeless anymore  Why?  Because she had like  Gotten out of being homeless  She moved in with some family  So she wasn't even  Walking around with  A real homeless person  That whole time  No why?  Because it was too scary  To actually go with  A real homeless person  Why do that?  That might have some kind  Of disease or something  Yep  Keep it safe 
[01:18:30]  It's got to be safe  Keep it safe  But make sure those  Ratings go up  Right Tyra?  Right?  We know what you're about  I love this woman  We do the same thing  But we openly admit  What it's all about  That's the difference  Oh did Jimmy say Moynihan?  Well yeah  Yeah  Oh I'm sorry  I meant to say  Oh my god  Walter  Walter Mondale  I apologize  Moynihan  I'm Patrick Moynihan  Different guy  My fault  Alright  Finally then we'll move on here  Kennedy light  Was Patrick Moynihan  Not much light  He was just like him  Big rummy  Big drunk  Where's he? 
[01:19:00]  Is he dead?  I don't know  I don't follow  It was funny how he just got mean  And sidetracked for no reason  He was a big rummy  Just a drunk  Is he dead?  This last clip  Is he dead?  This last clip  Is worth playing  Because Tyra experiences  What it's like  This is the one we were talking about  What's it like to sleep on the street  Yeah  Without actually staying overnight  But she knows all about it  Because she laid her head down  For about 15 seconds  Just in time for the cameraman 
[01:19:30]  To get a nice little angle there  Danielle said that around this time  We should lay down  And make our bed  So I would go to bed  And then  Stay awake  And watch  You would stay awake and watch  Like to protect me  And then we switch turns  And I knew I wasn't going to spend the night there  But I wanted to feel the terror  Of actually laying on the hard cement  Out in the open  And exposed  And calling it my day  For your face  Okay to cover the face  Yeah 
[01:20:00]  Oh a face cover  To protect yourself  So they don't know  If it's like a woman sitting there  Wow  Now it's Danielle's turn to rest  And for us to switch places  I was Danielle's keeper  I was her watch  I was her only safety  I understood at that moment  That there's no way  To really truly comprehend this  The homeless live like this  Every single day  But you know what  It's not a living  It's surviving 
[01:20:30]  Yeah  It's just existing  Yeah  No panty parties for the homeless  No  It's panty parties  But it's usually followed up  By a police report  And a rape kit  Oh she's so self-important  Every day  Every day  Do you hear the way she said that  Yeah  They go through this every day  Yeah  With their fake acting  Yeah  You're not an actress  You're not pulling this off Tyra 
[01:21:00]  You're not pulling it off  No one's buying this  Except that audience full of  Rubes that you got sitting there  What kind of gas  Do they pump into that studio  To get those people  So revved up  Wow  This one says  It's quite funny  That anyone in radio  Would have anything to say  About Tyra  They are in radio  For a reason  It's because their voice  Is better than their face  Ah  We've never claimed to be beautiful  Stacy 
[01:21:30]  You dope  Shock jock  Although I did claim to be beautiful  That's right  You could have been a model  I could have been a model  I heard that somewhere  Yeah  Oh that's right  It was from you  Anyway  Us Weekly  I guess they have a comment section  And the listeners have pretty much  Taken over that as well today  Yeah  My favorite is a post from  Benjamin Frankus  And says  She's fat but she's no  Frederica Bimmel  Frederica Bimmel  You're about a size 14  Read the one under that  That's nice and brutal 
[01:22:00]  Connor Peterson says  She brought this on herself  Much like my mother  And I brought on the stuff  That happened to us  Glub glub  Our listeners  Are amongst the most despicable  Vile  Ruthless  Bastards  On the face of this fine earth  Oh boy  These radio guys need to leave Tyra Banks alone  They're using the Jimmy Norton tack  Exclamation  Leave her alone 
[01:22:30]  I like the fact that Tyra points out  You don't have to starve yourself to be sexy  She shows a lot of confidence  And it shows  She's never had a stick figure  A thin figure  And when she was done with high fashion shows  The seamstresses used to call her fat  Because she wasn't a size 2  Oh  Give me a break  You know what else is annoying  The hell out of me  This whole thing they're doing  Where Europe has kind of banned 
[01:23:00]  These anorexic models  And they're trying to have them banned  In the United States  And some magazines aren't carrying  Pictures of these models  That are pretty much anorexic  You see their shoulder blades  And clavicles are popping out  And they're anorexic  That's all well and fine  Because they say  It's an unhealthy lifestyle  And what they're doing  Is showing children  Of course  Protect the children  That they should look like this 
[01:23:30]  And it's not healthy  How about  The fat models  And fat people in general  That are photographed  That is  More unhealthy  How many  Do people die more  From anorexia in this country  Or obesity  It's got to be obesity  It is so effing obesity  It's a drop in the bucket  The people that die from anorexia  How about  But if you said  We don't want fat models  In our magazine  You'd have the fat brigade  Parading up to a McDonald's 
[01:24:00]  Because it's convenient  Stampeding  Stampeding  Running in front of some Spaniards  Or behind them  God damn it  Running in the bulls  Would be silly  If the people chased the bulls  It's time to ban the dove ads  Yeah  The dove ads  With the chubby girls  In their underwear  The chubby girls  That's okay  But anorexia  You make a great point actually  We don't want  Anorexia  On the runway  But also  We don't want fat women 
[01:24:30]  Parading around  You'd get the fat brigade  They would come out  And just start saying  Why  You say this is  You're being prejudiced  Against fat people  In this day and age  And it's the same thing  It's because it's an unhealthy lifestyle  But the fatties  Just get away with it  Heart attacks  All the health risks  Oh my god  High blood pressure  Diabetes  Everything  Just keep lopping legs off  Hunting accidents  Being mistaken for wild game  The old oopsie 
[01:25:00]  Whoops  Well they're running  In Tyra clips like crazy  Because it's a big story  As far as the  Opie and Anthony show  Goes today  Because that sign  Is making its rounds  Tyra freaks out  Because top model  Contestant  Isn't taking  Being voted off  Seriously  Sam is saying  This is a good clip  Do you know that  All of America  Is rooting for you  Do you know that  And then you come in  And you treat this  Like a joke  You come in here  And look at that  And say I can't read that  You read  Ten times better  Than half of those  Girls over there 
[01:25:30]  You did  And you come in here  With a defeatist attitude  I don't have a bad attitude  Maybe I am angry inside  I've been through stuff  So I'm angry  But it's not  This is not  Be quiet  But everybody  Be quiet  That's what is wrong  With you  Stop it  Dramatic music  I have never in my life  Yelled a girl like this  When my mother yelled  At this  It's because she loved me  I was rooting for you  We were all rooting for you  How dare you  Learn something from this  How far  You go to bed at night  You lay there 
[01:26:00]  And you take responsibility  For yourself  Because nobody's going to  Take responsibility for you  Oh what a shame  You roll in your eyes  And you act like this  Because you've heard it all before  You've heard it all before  You don't know where the hell  I come from  You have no idea  What I've been through  But I'm not a victim  I grow from it  And I learn  Take responsibility for yourself  Oh boy  I know what she's been through  The candy aisle  El Fattorino  Oh she's so self important  And making everything  About herself 
[01:26:30]  Always  You don't know what  I've been through  Yeah when did it  How did it turn to her again  She's yelling at this girl  I've been through a cake  A few times  You know what I've been through  Right  Well you know what  We all need here  A penny party  Gotta calm everyone down  Make everyone happy again  Sing it Steve  Don't worry 
[01:27:00]  Be gay  When the closet's flung open  And you're seen standing in it  Don't worry  And we'll be back 
[01:27:30]  With the Opie and Anthony show  That's terrible  I'm sorry  Hear what everyone else  Is talking about  O&A Uncut  And live  Continuing the show  On XM Satellite Radio  Starting at 9 a.m. Eastern  Visit  XMRadio.com  To subscribe  This is the Opie and Anthony show  The virus is spreading  Opie and Anthony 
[01:28:00]  The people gotta be awake by now  So we can rock out a little bit  Right  It's the Opie and Anthony show  The O and A virus  Spreading across America  Before we move on  To other things  America is talking about today  One more final thing  From Tyra  Yeah stupid Tyra  I guess this is from her blog  She talks about  What it's really like  To be in prison  Apparently she was imprisoned  Did she commit a crime?  No of course  It was another one of our  Stupid show things  Whenever people do 
[01:28:30]  These prison shows too  And people have done them  All the people have done them  Like stop  And others  Yeah  There's no real way  For a celebrity  To go into prison  And get the prison experience  You could take a tour  Of a prison  You could kinda  You know  Do it that way  But you know  You're leaving  First of all  You know that  You're protected  You're not gonna get shanked  So you're not  Getting the prison experience  You leave anytime you want  And Tyra  I'm sure  It was even 
[01:29:00]  More innocent  But she talks about it  Like she was locked up  I did an episode  About being locked up  I actually went behind bars  At the California  Institution for Women  To understand why  More women were being  Incarcerated  Than ever before  Maybe they're committing  More crimes  And  She has to say things like  The place looked like  A college campus  And I had to keep  Reminding myself  That by no means  Was it a university  There were murderers  Housed there  And then  As if we didn't know  This place was no joke 
[01:29:30]  What?  Really?  I thought prison was a joke  Then there's a whole paragraph  On how everything there smelled  She says  I couldn't tell  By watching the show  You couldn't tell  But the smell at the prison  Was not pleasant at all  Didn't smell like a fine perfume  Does she know anything about smell?  Smell?  Probably not  For the people in prison  They don't even smell that anymore  For most people  Most people are used to  Some kind of bad smells  I bet she hasn't smelled  Anything bad ever 
[01:30:00]  No  Except when she  Sits down on a bowl perhaps  After eating  After a nice buffet  Watches her own dailies  This stinks  She was in prison  And then gives a little message  If you're thinking of doing something  Illegal  Don't  Thanks  Stop and think  These women were just like you  They weren't born convicts  They all had a choice  They chose to break the law  And that choice hurt them 
[01:30:30]  Somebody else  And now they're paying for their crimes  But the thing that she says  I say it once  I'll say it again  Prison is no joke  It's a living hell  And it's a hell that I pray  You never have to experience  Love Tyra  So what she's doing here  Is  Is helping us  If she wants to get  I was ready to just go out  And rob a bank  If she wants to get the prison experience 
[01:31:00]  She should have one of these in prison  Panty party  Yeah  Panty party  Oh yeah  In the laundry room  Oh yeah  With brooms  Anyway  So a lot of attention  Today  Steve  Opianathlete.com  Got all the articles  And all the links  To  Any new ones  Since we last  Talked to you  What we have up so far  Is best week ever  Us  Perez  And Defamer  Very good  Quickly also  We have some statistics  That were  Culled by  Our own Travis 
[01:31:30]  Oh boy  This isn't going to be accurate  I have no idea  Obesity  And anorexia  We're talking about  How they want to ban  Anorexia  Models  Models  From the runways  Because it's influencing  Young girls  To try to  Imitate this body  Style  Which is dangerous  To their health  Meanwhile  Fat women  Can be paraded around  And made heroes  And say  I look good  I know  Yeah I'm this big 
[01:32:00]  But it's sexy  And no one ever  Calls them out on it  Because they  As Jim said  We'll stampede you  Stampede of fat women  But here's some of the  I hope facts  That were gathered  By our own Travis  Obesity  Contributes to  And I guess  This is just obesity  Not just pleasantly plump  Or other problems  That give you heart problems  Or a stroke  Or something like that  Obesity  Contributes  To 300,000 deaths a year  Directly contributed 
[01:32:30]  Wow  In the U.S.  Or worldwide  U.S.  U.S.  Because I would gather  That no one else  Has anorexia  Around the world  Obesity  No I mean  For the statistic  On anorexia  To be in line  With the obese one  I've never heard  Of another country  That has anorexia  Anorexia  Africa  Say the truth  Yeah  Unintentional  Involuntary anorexia  300,000 deaths  I guess that would be  Diabetes  Heart attacks  Things that obese  People get  Anorexia 
[01:33:00]  1,000  1,000 deaths  A year  From anorexia  300,000  From obesity  So I really think  Banning fat people  From the eyes  Of children  How about  Parents that are fat  How about  They have  Their children  Taken away  Because they're  Showing  I think the  Parents are  More influential  Than a model  On a runway  And they  Fatten the kids  Up  They never  Make kids  They never  Tell kids  Make yourself 
[01:33:30]  Throw up  Lose the weight  They fatten kids  Up though  They contribute  To the obesity  And we don't  Care  What type of  Hey I don't  Care  I don't care  But when you're  Trying to ban  Anorexic models  The real problem  Is obesity  In this  In this country  Yeah  Anorexia  Media is just  So screwed up  And no one  Calls them out  On this  They take all  The easy things  The easy targets  Now the  Anorexic models  They won't bash  The anorexics  People with anorexia 
[01:34:00]  They'll bash  The fashion industry  For using  Anorexia  People with anorexia  To model their clothing  Or that anorexia look  I'm sure these are  Models that  You know  They act like models  They throw up  They chew on lettuce  And spit it out  That's their nutrition  For the day  But yeah  According to  Or on Travis  300,000 deaths  From obesity  8,000 for anorexia  Carlin's bid on anorexia  Is just  That's what I was thinking  Poetic 
[01:34:30]  And brutal  Yeah  Can't say it on regular radio  So nice and honest  Yeah look it up  Online there  Hey  Superbowl  It's going away  A couple things  To mop up  As far as the  Superbowl goes  Most watched  Superbowl ever  Wow  Yeah was it?  I believe  93 million people  93 million people  Why is that?  More people being born  Every year  So those stats  Are silly  To begin with  But  Also I think  Because people  Want to see  Some different teams  Like people got sick  Of the Cowboys  Like the Steelers  It was cool to see  The Colts 
[01:35:00]  Who you really rarely see  And then you know  The Chicago's  A huge market  So  That's true  Okay  If they only had a quarterback  Oh my god  If only you didn't  Pick him to win  True  The sports curses  I think that's better  Than any  They could have put  Anybody in  As quarterback  If you would have  Picked the Colts  To win  The Bears would have won  That's right  Rick Allen could have  Done a better job  Than that idiot  Did  Stupid fumbler  Yeah  2.5 million more viewers  Than last year's  Superbowl matchup 
[01:35:30]  When the Steelers  And the Seahawks  Went at it  But there's a lot  Of controversy today  There's two things  With a lot of controversy  As far as the  Superbowl goes  The first is the  The Snickers spot  Yeah  What's controversial about it  Oh  People are angry  Do you remember  The spot Anthony  It was like two mechanics  One guy has a Snickers bar  And what  Their hands are dirty  So they can't really  Really pass it off  To the other guy  And it's something  You want  They're sharing it  And it's something  You want so bad 
[01:36:00]  That you're willing  To take a bite  As it's in another man's mouth  So  Yeah  One guy had half of it  In his mouth  And the other guy  Went up and grabbed  The other half  And it looked like  They were kissing  And when they  Bit  The candy bar in half  And separated  It looked like  They had just kissed  They started doing things  To prove their manliness  Like ripping out  Their own chest hair  And doing  Things that kind of  Made them look more manly  Wow  Who's mad  Who do you think  Would get mad  At something like that  I'm gonna guess 
[01:36:30]  It's um  It's either A  A gay group  Who says that you  Shouldn't portray it  As a shameful act  Or  Oh it is them  Okay  Yeah  Give it right to you  Who else  Who was your second choice  Parents television council  Or one of those  Disgusting organizations  Because they might have  Been saying something like  That it implied  Some type of homosexuality  Yeah  Well here's the story  Yeah so they're ripping out  Chest hair and stuff  Saying see we're real men  See that was just a mistake  Blah blah blah  It was  It was kind of funny  One of the  Funnier spots I guess  Not everyone kissing up  To those Superbowl ads  Especially this one 
[01:37:00]  Snickers parent company  Mara's pulled the plug  On it's ad  Showing two men  Eating a candy bar  And ending up  In a lip lock  The candy maker  Came into criticism  That the ads  Are anti-gay  Because after the kiss  The men reacted  Violent disgust  The company's expressing  Regret for the ad  And promises  To never air them again  Oh god  They folded  They folded  Can I tell the gay people  Something  Can I tell the gay community  Something here  When straight men 
[01:37:30]  Think about kissing  Another straight man  It is disgusting to us  It is repulsive  And as I said earlier  Very funny  But it's something that  We do have this  She said it was a  Violent reaction of disgust  And stuff  Yeah  That's how we react  That's a natural reaction  To straight men  Like if we were ever  Put in that situation  That's how we react  Sorry  It's not a hatred  To the gay men 
[01:38:00]  Who enjoy doing this  It's our own feelings  Of disgust  Over that act  Being taken  By two straight men  And over the years  We've had gay guys  On our show  Doing horrific things  Oh yeah  Remember Gay Marco  I'm just thinking  About this  Can we air this  On XM by the way  Oh XM yeah  We can't air it  On regular radio anymore  Because the rules  Have changed  We did that  On regular radio  For the Britney Spears tickets  The old days  Yeah  Yeah  Yeah we had a gay guy  He had to do something 
[01:38:30]  With a girl  To get Britney Spears tickets  That he would never do  With a girl  If you know what I mean  Yep  And he was so disgusted  Just like  You know  Straight men were  If they were to do  What this Snickers  Commercial  Yeah  Showed  He was disgusted  Going  Ew that's gross  Just proving your point  That it works both ways  Here Anthony  Yeah  The gay community  Has to realize  That straight men  Find  The thought 
[01:39:00]  Of having any kind  Of sexual encounter  No matter how innocent  With another man  Is  It grosses us out  As much as it does  You  Having sex  With a woman  Or having some kind  Of a relationship  Like that  Sexually with a woman  My problem  More so  Mars just folded  It's like  Yeah they fold  You understand  Like your product  It's not a bad product  But it's like  It's all sugar  How about  The next commercial  They have  So they don't  Offend anybody  Is this a guy  Like who's got diabetes 
[01:39:30]  And both of his feet  Have been removed  And he's eating a Snickers  And he says  Not going anywhere  For a while  By the way Jimmy  I gotta help you out  A little bit  They weren't  In the slogan  I like that  They weren't  They were sort of bothered  With the Snickers commercial  But it was okay  To them  They're like  This  You know this  But  This is the real problem  The website said  You ain't seen nothing yet  It's gonna get sexy  It's not a Snickers next time 
[01:40:00]  Yeah  They took issue  With the now down  Snickers sites  Showing the reaction  Of three bears  And two Colts players  Who had watched the ad  Here's the latest thing  You get a commercial like this  We did the same thing  With some of our  Commercials for our radio show  You got the actual commercial  That airs on TV  Then you go to the website  And you see some alternate  Endings and stuff  And one of these things  You could have seen  On the website  But they took it down  Because they got scared  Was the reactions  Of three bears  And two Colts players  Who had watched the ad  What was it?  Right?  Of course  Of course it's gonna be 
[01:40:30]  Why can't they understand?  Why can't you gay guys understand?  It just doesn't  Float our boat  It makes us laugh  In some circumstances  It's funny  It's good  The more graphic it gets  By the way  And the more  The more sexual it gets  The funnier it gets  Gay sex  Sorry  It just is  Yeah we talked about that  And the romantic part of it  Like you could watch footage 
[01:41:00]  Of two gay guys having sex  And laugh  As a group of guys  That's what was happening yesterday  And the officer  Brought it up earlier in the show  What can I tell you?  Listen to the replay later  It's funny  But when it gets romantic  And there's hugging and kissing  And broke back mountain  Type stuff going on  We kind of recoil  And go like  Oh god  No don't kiss  Yeah  Yeah  It's just  That's how it is 
[01:41:30]  And you're not gonna change that  Ever  By complaining to a candy company  About its commercials  Well they also had a problem  With the three alternative endings  To this spot  Let's see  One in a row  With a poodle and some broth  Alternative ending  Oh okay  As far as the Bears  And the Colts players go  Getting hot talking about this  Let me take my coat off  This was the reaction  One of the players  One of the players  After seeing the commercial  This is the version  That was online  Said  That ain't right 
[01:42:00]  And a second made a face  Twisted with disgust  Of course  What do they think  And then of course  These guys are role models  For kids  And they're telling  America's kids  That two guys kissing  Ain't right  It's just  Yeah  To us  One of the alternative endings  Had a third guy approaching  After the close encounter  Brushing his hair from his eyes  He asked  Is there room for three  On this love boat  See that's inclusive  And another 
[01:42:30]  Instead of pulling out  Chest hair after the kiss  They drink motor oil  And antifree  That's funny  Children might drink  The antifree  But they got scared  And they got rid of all this  This is stuff you could  Check out on the website  Yesterday morning  And can I add to what you said  Because you made a good point  You didn't stress it hard enough  You said that this doesn't  Float our boats  Not only does it not  Float our boats  It certainly doesn't make us  Want to take our boats  And drive them into the mud  See and this is  And the group that had a problem 
[01:43:00]  The next one might be worse  They say  After the kiss  One picks up a wrench  And attacks the other  This wasn't one of the alternate endings  By the way  This is in their sick imaginations  Then the second slams the hood  Of the car  Of the head of the other  Yes the appropriate reaction  To a guy kissing you  Is to beat the crap  Out of the guy  Who kissed you  Maybe Snickers  Should rename the ad  Matthew Shepard  Oh my god  That's taken  Name it after a guy 
[01:43:30]  That was just murdered  Because he was gay  This has nothing to do with  There's different levels of things  Why does it have to always be  Just this or this  It's either  You find it wonderful  You smile  They expect men  To sit there  Straight men  To sit there  Watch that commercial  And smile  And go  That's nice  Like and then have the guys  Kiss and share  And share their Snickers bar  And have no problem with it  And then everybody 
[01:44:00]  Just go  Yeah  Yeah  Or  They're killing gay people  There's nothing in between  There's no  Like physical  Psychological reaction  That a normal  Heterosexual  Guy would have  Which is  Ugh  Ugh  Because you just think about it  And it's  Ugh  Yeah  That's why we're not gay  The reason you're gay  That's why we're not gay  It's easy  See how you're gay  The thing that repulses you 
[01:44:30]  About women  We love it  We love it  And you're disgusted by it  That's how we feel  About you guys  When you two get together  And you guys like  Heine spiders  We're disgusted by it  It doesn't mean  That the next step  Is to take a wrench  And start bashing your brains in  Or beat you  And leave you dead  On the side of a road  In Wyoming  It doesn't lead to that  It's  It's  A natural reaction 
[01:45:00]  To be  Disgusted by that  As a straight man  And calm down  Or I'm gonna have to  Make you happy again  Please don't  How great would it be  If they did name the ad  Matthew Shepard  Just to show them  Who's boss  I'd show him  Wouldn't that be fantastic  We'll say hi to John  And  Packs with peanuts  And broken bones  Let's say hi to John  In New England  Oh my god  Manip  Hey hey hey  No no no no  Those  I'm sorry  That manipulative nonsense  It is manipulative  Yeah  Absolutely  Silly  Alright we got a gay guy  On the line  This is very rare  For the opiate  What are you doing tonight 
[01:45:30]  Steve C  Where are you  No no no  Steve C  What's up  Hello  Yes I'm calling  From the other room  I mean  I'm calling from Jersey  He's trying to disguise words  I am a gay man  And I am not  Hey John  Hey  I have something to tell you  Yes my name is Peter  Travis  I'll be with you in a second  I was just  John what's up  Yes sir  Oh  Nothing much  First of all  It's Nebraska  Okay  Second of all 
[01:46:00]  I don't see that big deal  Wasn't it Wyoming  I think Wyoming  Matthew Shepard  No he's from Nebraska  I said New England  Because you know  Oh and he is Nebraska  All right  Okay  Could be New England  No New England's not  I thought we were in quadrants  Just northeast  All right  I'm from southwest  All right  What's up  New England's like an area  It's like the Golden State  They like to group themselves together  Those three states up there  Three or four states sometimes  Go ahead John  All right John  Yeah I don't see what the big deal is  Why everyone's making such a big deal of it 
[01:46:30]  I'm a gay gentleman  And I don't care  I think it's funny  Like everyone needs to loosen up  Oh you thought the spot was funny  Loosen up  That's your first step  I'd imagine you're pretty loose at this point  And there was no  But there was no hateful intent  You know what it was about  Just guys being  Because the guys were reacting like idiots  It's not like they were having a really rational angry reaction  They were just being dopes  All right  Yeah I've been listening to you guys for three years  And I think all your gay stuff's pretty funny  Do you understand the fact that  Straight men find gay guys being romantic with each other 
[01:47:00]  Like it puts us off  Yeah  It just does  It just does  But that doesn't lead to  You know break out the baseball bats  Yeah  Yeah  Thank you for understanding  I mean the personal is to just keep everything to the bedroom  Not worry about it  Yeah  It's sexy  Yeah  John are you a power bottom?  Of course  Power  Let me ask you a question  Power  Are you a sloppy party bottom?  No no no no 
[01:47:30]  All right  I'm also one of those people  Who like to dress up in mascot costumes  You know  Are you?  Yeah  What's that about?  Oh  Yeah it's actually pretty funny  You know  It's like you get to pretend you're something that you're not  Like you get to pretend you're a lion  Like the pride of dad's eye  All right  Thank you John  We gotta let you go  Oh my God  Because Billy from Union is very mad  Billy what's up?  What's up guys  I agree with John completely 
[01:48:00]  It's really stupid that our community is getting mad about something like this  I consider us to be somewhat enlightened  And I think that we have a pretty good sense of humor  And let's face it  The Super Bowl is not really geared towards the gay viewers  It's like  It's like the plan on an end of like two women kissing during the Tony Awards  Why you know  Why do people get mad about this?  Why do people get mad?  They don't get upset about girls kissing  But get upset about guys kissing right?  No that's not what I'm saying  Oh okay  I think he's sorry  I was half listening and reading  Are you agreeing with us?  Are you agreeing with us? 
[01:48:30]  I'm agreeing with you  Oh  Okay  I thought I was gonna have to yell  The Super Bowl  Guys are gonna get grossed out by it  Right  It's a football game  Give me a break  It was a funny ad  He's saying don't gear like two guys kissing  Like they're  Of course  He's like  That's like watching two women kiss during the Tonys  It was like  He used to say  That's a gay show  You're right  You know  Honestly I thought it was kind of hacky  Because that bit's been done so many times  Planes, trains, automobiles  Yeah  With John Candy and Steve Martin  When he realizes that his hand's not under a pillow or something  Between two pillows  And then they jump up and have to 
[01:49:00]  Oh you see the big game?  Yeah that is really hack  I mean that bit's been done a million times  But  Alright Billy  Thank you  Thank you  Bye Bill  Steve have you come in as an expert?  No I didn't  I just  Did you like the Snickers ad?  No  No I just love sitting in the other room  Talking to Roland about some show stuff  And then all of a sudden  I just turn up the speaker a little bit  And hear  Oh I'm gay again  And then you realize it's just a voice in your head  There's no speaker there  Why don't you ask Roland 
[01:49:30]  Roland's not there  Why we didn't get Catherine McPhee  I did  And what did he say?  He kissed me  She wasn't  It was a long make out session  See that was our out  Hey can I ask  We should have got one of those gay guys  I'd love to talk to a guy from the group  Who said that about Matthew Shepard  Dude how do you justify that?  Yeah  We tried actually  That's exploiting  That's exploiting Matthew Shepard  8,000 times worse than the commercial ever even did 
[01:50:00]  And it wasn't even intended  To offend  But to then bring up his name  Like as the martyr  And you're going to now use his name  That's awful  That guy should be  Anything you do to him  He didn't enjoy  So  Is Howard off today?  Because people are listening to us  That usually don't listen  I just went  I don't know  Just say probably  Probably  Or maybe he's boring 
[01:50:30]  Maybe he's just doing more sex talk  I was laughing  Because I saw you ready to go to break  Oh  It's the Opie and Anthony Show  The Opie and Anthony Virus  So what's going on with Diane Sawyer today?  By the way this is the Opie and Anthony Show  She's over in Syria  She's in Damascus  Doing this week long thing with the president of Syria 
[01:51:00]  Of Syria  And first of all  His chin is unbearably tiny  But I was watching him interview the last few days  Just glancing at the TV  And I said this yesterday  I'm so easily led  Like he's laughing and having fun  And he's winning me over  I'm such an ass  Now you like him  More yeah  They're cooking things together  Yeah  They're doing a cooking eating segment  What a genius PR move  With the president of Syria  Is that a radical man?  It's like one of the Axis of Evil or something  You know  They're naughty  And he's dressed all in nice western attire 
[01:51:30]  He's in a suit  And you know  Looking like a real human being  And America watches  And says  Hey look at that guy  He don't seem so bad  It's smart PR  Yeah  On his part  Laughing with Diane Sawyer  And his wife is fantastic  She's really solid  Yeah  Oh my god  Yeah I think they're all supposed to be covered up  Not this one  Running around in a pantsuit  I don't know what the protocol is over there  I don't know much about Syria  I remember we landed in Kuwait  To go to Iraq  And Colin said that they were all wearing pantsuits 
[01:52:00]  Like Mary Tyler Moore  Laughing  Laughing  Laughing  Laughing  Laughing  Pantsuit  Laughing  Oh  Just throw your hat in the air  Throw your head in the air  Laughing  Laughing  Savages  Yeah  We're gonna wreck it after all  Laughing  Hopefully this will be the last Super Bowl story  Until next year  Uh  The last time CBS televised a Super Bowl  It turned over the halftime show  To corporate sibling MTV  Which presented the wardrobe malfunction  That bared one of John Jackson's breasts to the world 
[01:52:30]  Oh  And ignited a reaction that led to the uh  Still  And uh  Well with the you know  The fines and stuff of course  Yeah  So three years later  What does CBS do?  It presents a halftime show  In which Prince and his guitar  Combine for a rude looking shadow show  Yeah  Are they reaching here?  They are totally reaching  Prince put on a great show  Despite conditions that made purple rain  An all too appropriate song choice  Ah  Cause it was  Raining  But it wasn't purple  It was still just regular water 
[01:53:00]  I  I think he just uh  Wong it up there  I don't really think he had anything planned  And just decided to play guitar for everybody  Eh  You know  During that  He made the crowd happy  Well this is uh  Like some of his hits  This is the problem that some people are trying to make a big deal  Uh  During that number though  A billowing sheet of fabric was raised above him  And lit from behind with spotlights  So that his shadow loomed very large  Ooh  Unfortunately  So did a devilish appendage  At the bottom of the body of Prince's custom made guitar 
[01:53:30]  Yeah  The guitar looked like a you know what  Yeah sure  Part of Prince's personal uh  All right whatever  So it just goes on  Uh  Yeah  All right  It was a silhouette  That some are  Yeah  Are perceiving as his uh  You know  A phallic  Very large and devilish  A phallic symbol  Yes  What a  What a  A guitar  Just by its very nature  If you are playing it  And silhouetted  You don't play it with like a harmonica 
[01:54:00]  It's not like a look  It looks like a guitar  Is through his head  It's gonna look like that  Isn't it  I mean you play it  Your guitar  Slung down a little low  I think he did it on purpose  And he knew exactly  What it was gonna look like  As a shadow  And he didn't give a crap  Yeah  And neither should  Neither should anyone else  Is some busy bodies  Trying to make some of this  Busy bodies  Well it made Alison Stewart's  A little TV show last night  Did it  Yeah  Why didn't she call us for comment  I don't know  She was filling in for Keith Olbermann 
[01:54:30]  Who I  Forever being called back  Who I enjoy  But here's Alison Stewart last night  Talking about this  So did Prince get away  With something here  The cheeky devil  Absolutely  He pulled out the guitar  Formerly known as Phallus  And he did a Daniel Radcliffe  Oh by the way  This is Michael Musto  Is this guy  One of the talking heads  One of the quote experts  They brought in to discuss  The halftime show with Prince  Is he that big square headed guy  With the big dark  Like rimmed glasses  He's like whenever they need a gay guy 
[01:55:00]  Yeah  They get him  Yeah  Michael Musto  Yeah  You know him  I saw him riding his bicycle  Around town  Every so often  You see him riding his bicycle  Without a seat  Don't go to break  That was just  That was a good one though  That was a good one  Hey who swallowed that  Michael Musto  You know  So did Prince get away  With something here  The cheeky devil  Absolutely  He pulled out the guitar  Formerly known as Phallus  And he did a Daniel Radcliffe  I mean that was the biggest thing 
[01:55:30]  I've seen since Kevin  Showed his bacon  In the movie Wild Things  Could this guy throw in  Any more crap  That's a picture of him there  Jimmy if you want to  Since Kevin showed his bacon  Yeah this is  He did a Daniel Radcliffe  Hey Kevin showed his bacon  Ah yeah the four  Or disinformally known as Phallus  Ah any other jokes  I can think of  Oh shut up already  It's like Al Franken  This little fruit  Yeah  Kevin showed his bacon 
[01:56:00]  I wish it was Brian Cox  He was talking about  So what's a Brian  Phallus  And he did a Daniel Radcliffe  I mean that was the biggest thing  I've seen since Kevin  Showed his bacon  In the movie Wild Things  It almost poked my eyes out  And I was sitting at home  Watching on TV  At home on what?  I was at a friend's house  Lots of kids in the room  Bye bye  Bye  Why is he drinking?  He was at a friend's house  Is it possible for it to poke your eye out  If you're watching on TV?  At home?  No  Very very rare occasion 
[01:56:30]  But he said it almost happened  Even though he was at home  Watching on TV  I would like to explain that further  It wasn't even in 3D  Where he was pushing it toward the screen  It was behind a sheet  Right right  Well the sheet hit the fan  Ah ha ha ha  He's awful  At home watching on TV  I have to tell you  I was at a friend's house  Lots of kids in the room  Me about 10 boys  Ages 9 to 13  Right in that  Ah ha ha  Hormone time  Couldn't stop laughing 
[01:57:00]  Every one of them  They turned them all gay  I'm pretty sure  Why make it into a gay thing  You idiot  It was wishful thinking on his part  Of course  Believe me  And what's she doing  Hanging out with a bunch of kids  Yeah no kidding  So kids are laughing at that  So  Yeah  Who cares  Me and Michael  I was at Michael Devlin's  Watching the game  It was nice  It's like  That's kind of like  That's like potty humor  To little kids  It is  Like whatever  And then they move on  And go play their video games  That's a prime example too 
[01:57:30]  Of the Janet Jackson thing  Like a room full of kids  Would be laughing at that  It wasn't one of those  Big moments  Where it's going to  Destroy humanity  Jeez  Just relax everybody  It was so tense  The Janet Jackson  We've said it a million times  Most people didn't even know  What they saw  It happened so freaking fast  We only realized  What we saw  When they slowed it  Way down on the news  Over and over  And over again  The news was the real problem  And that is something  That is  And they did it 
[01:58:00]  Under the guise  That we have to  Protect our children  Through the family  You know this is a family thing  We gotta show you  What CBS did  So they slow it down  Are you kidding me  Yeah  If they just let that moment  Go by  No one would have cared  Meanwhile  You know  We watched  Flaming Towers  Fall down  8,000 times  For all of your children  To enjoy  To their horror  But  You know  A little boobage  With a pasty  Type thing on it  Was gonna destroy the earth 
[01:58:30]  And now someone's  Trying to make  Trouble with this  Yeah  With a silhouette  Of a guitar  Behind a sheet  Yeah  We're just done  Stupid  We're doomed as a nation  If we continue on this  Path  And finally  This is just another  Great story  Just a great story  Has this ever  Happened before  I'll play  The news story  Really fast  Oh I gotta hear it first  I was just gonna  Randomly guess at things  Alright go ahead  Guess  No it hasn't  I would say no too  Okay  Orlando police have arrested 
[01:59:00]  A Texas astronaut  Saying she tried to kidnap  Another NASA employee  Orlando police say  Lisa Marie Nowak  Drove from Texas  To Mars  To confront  Colleen Shipman  About a relationship  With a fellow astronaut  Both women appear to be  Involved with the same man  Orlando police say  Nowak waited at the airport  For Shipman to arrive  And then attacked her  With pepper spray  Shipman slipped away  And called police  Nowak faces 
[01:59:30]  Four criminal charges  Including attempted kidnapping  And vehicle burglary  With battery  Gotta love it  This is like white trash stuff  It's happening  It's happening with  It's happening with  Astronauts  Yeah  She was also  Wearing diapers for the ride  Yeah  She wouldn't have to stop  Because they wear diapers  During takeoff  And that's like  I always wondered  What does NASA not do  Is going to go to the bathroom  When you're sitting there  For eight hours waiting  They have diapers on  Little Depend  Undergarment  Soaks it up  She's wearing space diapers  She's married  And she was freaking out 
[02:00:00]  That this other chick  Astronaut  Was after this other astronaut  It's like a lot of  You know what  I kind of grew up  At a time  Where there weren't  Many astronauts  I guess  Like we knew them all  You knew all the  Astronauts names  Pretty much  The original Mercury 7  And this was  And then  The Gemini  And then  Apollo astronauts  A lot of them  Were carryovers  From the Mercury  And Gemini program  So it was a very  Very elite  Club  The best of the best 
[02:00:30]  The best of the best  Right  And now  We're starting to get  Astronauts that are  A little more like  Regular people  And that's kind of  Encouraging in a weird way  Because to me  It's making it like  Wow  Spaceflight  Is kind of getting  Accessible to the  Normal nut  Where regular people  Are becoming astronauts  As long as you're  Physically fit  To go up into space  You go up into space  A mere what  30 years later  It's watered down nicely  That's it  Yeah  Yeah  There it is 
[02:01:00]  You know  It's kind of nice  It's very futuristic  But it's like  Even as an astronaut  When you come down to it  You're just a nutty bitch  Yeah  You're an astronaut  You've flown in space  And when all is said and done  You put on diapers  Because you're a nut  I just  I just thought they lived  The pure life  You know  Yeah  But it's happening  With astronauts too  No it's  Everyone still has that  Image of the astronaut  Like they did years ago  You know  Very clean cut  Very living  A very  Clean lifestyle 
[02:01:30]  But  It's encouraging  I like this  I like this story  It's telling me  That there might  Someday be a space station  And we'll  We'll be able to go up there  And  Maybe not we  But  Future generations  Leave it for the children  Get the ass to Mars  You crazy bitch  Well she had  Pepper spray  She had a mallet  She had a BB gun  And she had  A mallet  She was gonna  I don't think  She was gonna kill the girl  Tom and Jerry  Don't these idiots  Like Brian Pan  And big scissors 
[02:02:00]  Don't these idiots  Play it out in their head  Like who's ever  Gonna get away with this  Well she wanted to  Question her  She had a wig on too  She wanted to question her  About her relationship  With this guy  Probably in a disguise  And  She had to drive  Through four states  Thinking about this  In diapers  And she's flown in space  It doesn't make sense  Yeah she was in space  43  So she was an astronaut  That actually went up  Oh yeah  She was on the shuttle  Yeah  Shuttle measure  And she was on the space station  Yeah  She's a real live astronaut 
[02:02:30]  That's cool  And she's  Yeah I'm with you  I like this story  She circled the earth  In 90 minutes  And yet she drove  Through four states  In diapers  And a wig  To confront someone  About sleeping  With another guy  Who's flown around the earth  It's lunacy  Yeah  Do you understand  There was a time  When she was driving  And she would get  That little chill  Up her back  And go thank god  I don't have to stop  And that little  Louisiana  Welcome to  Hey this could be fun

[02:08:00]  Thank you. 
[02:08:30]  Thank you. 
[02:09:00]  Thank you. 
[02:09:30]  Thank you. 
[02:10:00]  They are the most vile, despicable human beings in the country.  Creeps, ankle biters.  Obviously, the strength is their ability to turn mistruth into something people would believe.  Wow, how long is this guy going to continue to babble and say nothing?  All day long.  Shut up.  All right, here we go.  Welcome to the Opie and Anthony show.  It's worse than it's worse than I imagined. 
[02:10:30]  It's worse than I imagined.  That's terrible.  I'm sorry.  We are a bunch of dopes.  I think we're lewd.  And we're probably pushing 20 arrests because of this radio show.  Out of touch, cornwalls, three retards.  We have the effect of Tylenol PM.  You know, I could have been a model.  Anthony.  I'm dead.  James Norton.  I like yogurt.  Robert Reed.  But enough of this palaver. 
[02:11:00]  Let's get the show on the road.  Let's.  I'm hungry.  Are ye?  I'm very hungry.  It's the second half of the Opie and Anthony show.  Still got lots to do today.  I'm going to spit out me gum.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  You know, show a little gum for the walkover. 
[02:11:30]  A walkover is just brutal.  We ditched a couple of fans over there at 92.3.  Over at the FM station.  There were a couple of fans waiting out front.  And, of course, we're all bundled up.  It's freezing fuck cold in New York.  So I had my hood up.  You did too.  Everyone did.  Everyone was all covered up.  And we all came walking out and walked past them.  And Kenny tells me once we get here, he goes, you know, those two fans, they didn't even 
[02:12:00]  realize you left.  They're still standing there.  I thought maybe someone would have told them, like, you know, we're just doing a very quick walk because it's freezing.  I feel bad.  No one told them.  So they're just standing there.  Usually we hang and have a lot of fun out there.  A little chit chat, but not today.  By the way, we'll bring back the walkover somewhere.  Or probably June.  Yeah, right?  Probably late March.  Yeah. 
[02:12:30]  When it's nice.  And people are bitching and complaining.  But first, it's too cold out there.  Yes.  And second, the bit needed to be rested.  You got to rest these things from time to time.  Oh, you did not like the Mike Tyson bit?  I was listening here laughing at the shit we used to get away with.  Holy motherfucker.  Boy, did we used to.  I said, you lie me twat.  Oh, because you can't say twat on the radio.  And I said, oh, yeah, twat, twat, twat, twat.  If Popeye could say pusky, I could say twat. 
[02:13:00]  Unbelievable.  Oh, the shit we used to get away with.  And that's not bad.  You should be able to get away with that.  Yeah, absolutely.  Speaking of which, at 11 o'clock today, because we were digging up all the old stuff,  Gay Marco eats pussy for Britney Spears.  Oh, that was a good one.  God, was that a good one?  For Britney Spears tickets.  If you've never heard this bit, it's probably one of my favorites of all time.  Gay man completely disgusted at the fact that he's got a lick snatch.  And it's appropriate today because of the Snickers commercial and how we reacted over that. 
[02:13:30]  Yeah.  What happened to him, Gay Marco?  How come guys at that don't call you that?  It's interesting you say that, Jimmy.  I don't know where we're at, but I told Steve to write a promo.  I want a homecoming week on the Opie and Anthony show.  Maybe.  He's probably in a robe.  Oh, no, no.  Really?  Oh, boy.  Well, that's why.  Oh, you're just guessing.  You're just being whimsical.  Right.  Whimsical.  I think a promo's going to be running very soon.  We're looking for all the old people.  Homo?  Not all of them, but most of them. 
[02:14:00]  And we want to see what they've been up to and stuff.  Old Dirty.  Old Dirty's in there.  Gay Marco.  Old Dirty.  Who else was there besides Old Dirty?  Frenchie, but Ant sees Frenchie a lot.  You got the promo yet?  Promo is almost done.  We're just looking for more drops.  Even some of the people that we forgot about, but they did some massive thing for our show.  Limo Ant.  Limo Ant would be good.  Psycho Mark.  We only had one update with Psycho Mark, man.  Psycho Mark.  So we're going to do like a homecoming week, and then we're going to bring these people in 
[02:14:30]  or have them call, and maybe other people have updates on these people.  You know, it'll be fun for the old-timers.  Who used to come in with Old Dirty?  There was an O.D.  The old-timers.  Oh, PR.  PR, man.  God, I used to love PR.  That guy used to make me laugh.  Fucking Susie Greenberg?  Yeah, there you go.  See?  Wow.  All right.  So Steve's going to be...  Got to remake it now.  I know her.  Steve's going to make a promo.  He's going to try to get these people emailing, and we'll get a hold of them, and we'll get  some updates and stuff. 
[02:15:00]  Awesome.  And maybe they become stars again.  You never know.  Who was the hot chick that everybody wanted to bang?  Rebecca?  Rebecca?  Yeah, Pinknips.  Pinknips?  What?  You don't remember Pinknips?  She was one of the fucking message board girls.  She was really cute.  I saw her years ago on a show at Rascal.  I haven't seen her in five years.  Holy shit.  This is one that went...  I have no clue.  You know who she is if you saw...  I don't even know if she ever came to the studio.  What did she used to do for the show?  I don't know.  She was just a message board girl, but all the listeners are who she was.  A lot of them did.  Pink?  What?  Yeah.  Is anybody from the...  Somebody could back me up from the old days. 
[02:15:30]  Knife Girl?  I'm usually pretty good.  Jackie, yeah.  Yeah, get Jackie the Knife Girl.  Tom from New Orleans.  Oh, wow.  That would be good.  Yeah, see?  Some of the listeners would be able to help with that one.  Jamaican Mike, of course.  That fucking, yeah, but his massive fucking cock.  Dan from Hoboken.  One of the instant feedbackers, yeah.  One of the original instant feedback guys.  I think he was a teacher, though.  I think he was a teacher, and I think that his schedule is probably why he...  Just sucks?  Yeah, he's probably...  11-year-old Gary, who's got to be 17 now.  30.  Has to be.  Probably playing for the Islanders.  Yeah, this kid that I promised to take to the Islander game, and it never happened, 
[02:16:00]  and he's got to be 16, 17 years old now.  So we'll get updates on some of these quirky people, maybe play some of their old audio.  So what about...  Brings the new people up to speed with some of them.  Psycho poetry chick.  Oh, my God.  With the Christmas lights.  She was very early on.  She came in naked, wrapped in Christmas lights, reading poetry, which I critiqued,  and she's eating the living shit out of me.  Yeah.  She was hitting me with her poetry book.  That was a good one. 
[02:16:30]  What about Irene?  She never called back.  That was the first time Jimmy was in studio.  Irene playing her dumb piano.  Oh, I'm thinking of...  No, no, no.  I'm thinking of Irene, the caller who hated us.  Remember the one who...  Oh, my God, yeah.  Remember her?  Have we played that over here?  Oh, remember her?  She had a husband have a heart attack or something, and she left him in the bathroom to die?  Left him in the bathroom on the floor.  No, no, no.  The woman you're thinking of was an older gentleman, and her name was...  Was it Irene?  I think it was Irene.  It was my first day in the studio with Dice. 
[02:17:00]  I think it was Irene.  And her old...  No, she had a name.  Oh, Fran.  Fran.  Fran.  Fran.  Fran.  Fran.  Fran.  You're right.  You're right.  And I had a gig that day, fucking in Connecticut, and I was like, I have to leave, and I'm like,  you're going to walk off a New York radio show with Dice to go do a fucking $125 gig,  you fucking dumb motherfucker.  And then in that last hour, I had some good lines.  I woke up, because I was really quiet.  Yeah.  So I'm really glad.  And all you Norton haters, only if I'd have left them doing that gig.  Yeah, that's what turned us. 
[02:17:30]  We delivered keggers.  Nicky?  Yeah, get Nicky, the keggers chick.  I have her cassette, actually.  She's a singer.  Jay Moore, whatever happened to Jay Moore, that would be nice to get up there on him.  Yeah, what happened to him?  He's part of the Ron and Fess show now.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah, the young teen, Corinne, who's probably now 30.  Oh, my God.  Remember?  She got us an FCC violation.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Not intentionally.  What about?  It was after Drew Boogie put it in a remix and took everything that was in correct context  and made it into bad context. 
[02:18:00]  It wasn't his fault.  It sounded great.  I think we got fined just $30,000.  Who cares?  That's fucking weeks' worth of work for a lot of these guys.  We didn't have to pay it.  The bosses pay that crap.  The oldest stripper ever, and she stripped out one of our live shows.  I think she was pushing 70 at the time.  She would be close to 80 at this moment.  Sandy Kane, where's she been?  Sandy Kane.  I saw her at a comedy show in Stand Up New York.  I walked in, and she's just lurking there.  Awful lurking.  Walking into a mausoleum.  What about the chick that breastfed her four-year-old in front of us? 
[02:18:30]  That was Kate.  Thank you.  I still have her contact with her.  The listeners are really helping out right now.  So we want to do a whole week.  It's like homecoming week.  We'll throw all the material aside and just get updates on all these people.  We said you're making Mike.  Oh, you did?  Yeah, we said you're making Mike.  I see him.  I see him everywhere.  Wall Street Dave, who was so rich from the dot-com thing that he would just hand us piles  of cash to have girls do ridiculous things, remember?  Paul the Pilot.  She was ridiculously rich.  Paul the Pilot.  He had a little incident, didn't he? 
[02:19:00]  But he's okay now?  Yeah.  New show sucks.  Wasted money on XM Radio.  You guys aren't funny anymore.  Oh, yeah.  Opie better get your dad out of the oven.  He smells overcooked.  Cunts.  Okay.  All right.  That guy's...  I don't remember that bit.  It's a little long-winded.  Yeah, I don't either.  So there you go.  You're not Jewish, aren't you?  Did the guy leave his real name?  No, of course not.  Oh, really?  He's a pussy.  Well, who else?  There's plenty of old people fucking...  Uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh.  PR, I totally forgot about it. 
[02:19:30]  Uh, the fat chick, uh...  She's on this show and that narrows it down.  Mendy.  Mendy.  Mendy and Connie.  Remember them?  The two fucking monsters?  Everyone knows it's Mendy.  Ah, she was...  See?  Big fat Mendy.  Could play her song and see what she's up to.  Wow.  I moved to Florida.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Uh, Paul Mercurio.  Eh, well...  Yeah, Paul, I still see...  It might be time.  Yeah, I think it is.  I still see Paul at the Comedy Cellar and he wants to have a heart-to-heart and I got no  more, you know...  It's like I had a resentment for a while.  I was angry.  Yeah.  And I was open with him about it.  I told him I was angry and...  Yeah, it could be... 
[02:20:00]  Could be time to...  Yeah, man.  ...bring Paul on and discuss...  And see what he's been up to.  Whatever happened to Anthony's daughter, Lynn?  Remember that?  Oh, my God.  Remember her?  Jesus.  She was the one that, uh...  would call up and say that I was her father and she was a lunatic.  Yeah.  She was a loony.  All right.  Wheelchair Fred, we haven't heard from him in a while, even though he's kind of...  Wheelchair Fred.  Wheelchair Fred.  Yeah.  He was on the new show, but...  Yeah, we'll get an update from him.  Drudge Jr. 
[02:20:30]  Yeah.  Yes.  That little bastard.  Remember Drudge Jr.?  Wasn't he a prick or was he a good...  I don't remember.  He was...  He would be a little prick.  He was young, so it was funny.  Also, look...  He was a little prick.  Fancy Man's got a good idea.  We're also looking for these one-and-done guys.  Like, uh...  The guy who fucked the dead monkey skull.  Oh, dead monkey, uh...  Yeah, but his life had to have changed.  He probably talks about it all the time, and he's known as guy who fucked dead monkey skull.  God, how we did that.  Um...  Jesus Christ.  Taylor Law.  Remember her?  Bestiality. 
[02:21:00]  I don't even know if she does porn anymore, unfortunately.  No, she doesn't.  She's doing fitness modeling.  Yeah.  Fantastic body.  Uh...  All right.  Yeah, so...  There you go.  Coming soon to the Opie and Anthony Show.  Home, uh...  Homecoming week.  All right?  And Steve, you're gonna have an email address or something in the promo?  Yep.  All right.  A couple email addresses.  So when they got it all nice and organized, and we got enough people that we found, we'll bring  it to you guys on, uh...  202 here.  Over at XM.  Mario Cantone.  He stopped coming on the show. 
[02:21:30]  Well, he stopped coming on the show when he became famous.  It happens a lot.  Who misses him?  I could care less.  It happens.  Same three impressions.  It happens a lot.  We get it.  You're a pet bird.  Ah!  Ah!  Fucking sweaty hands.  Shut up.  Buzz.  Buzz from Home Alone.  Oh, yeah.  What happened to Buzz from Home Alone?  I haven't talked to him in a while.  We should contact his alcoholism.  I'm sure that should reach him.  Fucking sot.  I could always find him at Bar 9 when we were always going down there.  Yeah, he was a good guy, man. 
[02:22:00]  What's his name?  Oh, my God.  No, his name is...  Devin Retreat.  Yeah.  Yeah.  All right.  So, you guys get the bit.  Can we keep coming up with them as the day goes on?  I'm getting all nostalgic now.  Carol Miller?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Uh, dub-a-doo, dub-a-doo, dub-a-doo, dub-a-doo.  Uh, Steve in Cincinnati.  What's up?  Hey, how's it going, guys?  I love the show.  I'm a new listener.  Thank you, Johnny Fever.  Oh, thank you, Jimmy.  I love you.  I love your show on HBO, man.  I got the DVD.  It's great.  Oh, thank you, buddy. 
[02:22:30]  Lucky Louie.  I was listening earlier, though, about that first guy.  I guess he would be the line of the day, the last guy you guys talked to.  I'm out of here.  Later.  I didn't hear what he said.  Yeah, dude.  We were...  Wow.  What did he say?  He panicked.  He just panicked on us.  He panicked.  Dustin Diamond.  Yeah, they're still coming in here.  All right.  I don't think Dustin Diamond would have gotten any better.  All right, listen.  E-Rock got waxed yesterday.  This is leading to somewhere.  We got the montage of him yelling and screaming. 
[02:23:00]  Which is the dirty version?  We promised this today.  Two?  Okay.  So this is some of the highlights from...  Wait, wait, wait.  The new craze is fence plowing?  What is fence plowing?  Five New York teenagers arresting themselves.  Internet video shows vandals breaking fences.  What they do is run headfirst into fences.  They're all white kids.  They have to be.  Is that a new craze?  I wouldn't call it a craze.  Arrested for criminal mischief.  The news just made it a new craze. 
[02:23:30]  You know what the news loves, especially MSNBC and those outlets?  Love YouTube.  Oh, do they love it.  They troll it.  They find little things and then make stories around it.  A new craze?  I haven't heard about this since this second.  Right.  And I'm pretty much...  It's my job to know things.  That's just a little known fact about us.  We spend most of our days, especially when it's cold out,  just searching for stuff to talk about on the show. 
[02:24:00]  No, I've never heard of this thing.  No, not one fat person at a fucking...  At a county fair one time to get at the buffet before everyone else.  Long way to go for nothing.  That's how you understood.  Well...  That was the sound of her actually hitting the fence.  I...  I...  Here's another one.  Oh, back to back.  I watched the guy make a stun gun out of the camera.  Did you see that one?  No.  Yeah, guy takes a disposable camera,  makes a stun gun out of it on YouTube.  It's a whole little lesson on how to do it,  and then he goes up to one of his friends sitting on a porch, 
[02:24:30]  and jolts him in the neck with it.  It doesn't put him down,  but it gives him a little spark and kind of hurts him.  I love those videos.  I put in taser or stun gun or anything on YouTube.  Hours of fun.  He'll sit back and laugh and laugh.  Yeah.  What are you doing to me?  I'm not doing it to you.  Ah!  Oh, it's so funny.  All right, here we go.  So, E-Rock, a montage of him getting waxed yesterday.  Yes.  Armpit hair, chest hair, bunghole hair, taint hair. 
[02:25:00]  Well, the bunghole hair he took out at home, I think,  because we just had the girl slop some of that honey wax,  that sticky shit, all over his ass crack and balls and taint,  and then made him pull his pants up and spend the whole day like that  and then go home like that, all sticky-ass.  And this is the reason why you guys were watching gay porn.  This is what we're leading to.  Oh, okay.  First, here's the original audio, a montage of E-Rock getting waxed.  Ah!  Fuck! 
[02:25:30]  Oh, hey!  Oh, hey!  Whoa!  Wait a minute!  Oh, we had a curse!  Did I hear a curse?  He cursed again!  Did he think something inappropriate?  Wait, what?  Oh, God.  This one. 
[02:26:00]  E-Rock, you cursed.  He fell off the toilet.  Is it possible to rewind that last one he did?  Yeah, why?  Because I want to know how to make that a ringtone.  Just that last one he did is such a perfect phone ring.  Yeah, speaking of, where's Danny? 
[02:26:30]  I want this.  Steve Song is my new ringtone.  Sorry, Jimmy.  Steve Song is funny.  I'm sorry, but my, you know, I got porn on my computer is over.  Oh, that's all right, dude.  I thought you took it off.  You had fucking balls leaving on that long.  Yeah.  All right, yeah, I'll get to the end.  How does that, wait, can someone put a ringtone on my phone?  Yes.  Yeah, they're great.  Will someone do it?  No.  Of course.  I'll give you $5.  $5.  That's right.  And I'll show you not how to fucking button your shirt like a Mexican gang member.  Danny, E-Rock, E-Rock's screaming for text messages. 
[02:27:00]  Okay.  And my ringtone now is the happy song.  Okay.  What was that?  Thank you, sir.  What came up out of you?  I've been sick for like 10 days.  Wow.  I'm still doing the mucinex to get the water out of my lungs.  I was kind of ebbing and flowing.  You were talking.  A big bubble of something came up.  Opie.  Here it is, Jimmy.  The last one is somewhere around here.  Oh, God. 
[02:27:30]  E-Rock, you cursed.  He fell off the toilet.  He's crumpled.  I love it.  Oh, that is a good one.  He is yelling.  Well, by the way, is that audio up on opandethy.com?  The happy song?  I think it is.  Right, Steve?  Because other people want it as a ringtone. 
[02:28:00]  All right, good.  So they took the E-Rock audio.  Good old Derek.  Who else helped with this?  Who needs credit today?  Mostly Derek.  Mostly Derek?  All right.  He took what you just heard and made something out of it.  I love Derek.  I smell a lot.  I haven't said smelled in a while, but I smell a bit.  If we have this audio up, the montage audio, I think the listeners can have a little fun  with that.  All right, Steve?  Audience participation.

I start off on your knees first.  Sniff my balls with your nose first.  Then I'll pull out my cock.  Shove it in the back of your throat.  Smack it across the face a couple of times.

[02:30:30]  No!  Ha ha ha ha ha ha!  B-b-b-b-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba!  Thank you. 
[02:31:00]  Oh, that's terrible. I'm sorry. 
[02:31:30]  Those two things we just played back-to-back, border on brilliant.  Of course.  That's Drew Boogie, of course.  We haven't given him enough plugs for that piece of music.  And then the E-Rock Derek thing, that's just amazing.  That's great, the fist at the end.  Oh, God!  Why is Drew Boogie fucking having to still drive a truck?  This guy, he's very talented, man.  He should be fucking...  He should be doing something with his wife.  Well, he's probably lazy and shiftless.  No, I think he needs a break, that's all.  Hey, Drew's good, man.  He's amazing. 
[02:32:00]  Jason from Rye, Derek just moved up in the Employee of the Week standing.  That's true.  I say right to the top.  Yeah, I agree.  And now, the new number one is Derek.  For his production skills on E-Rock Gets a Fist of the Ass.  People want to try to make their own, so Steve, hopefully we'll put the raw audio up there  and then that example and then others could have fun with that.  A la the Bob Kelly audio.  A la.  A la. 
[02:32:30]  A la.  A la la la la la la la.  U.S. pilots hit British forces in Iraq, yeah.  Yikes.  We were watching this in the office before the show today.  Eek.  Pretty amazing.  Little friendly fire incident that happened.  This is like three days into the war, so this is a while back.  But, I don't know.  You can't blame the guys, but it seemed like there was a little mystery going on as to  who they were shooting at right from the get-go.  And then, when they find out that they hit British troops on the ground with the A-10s, 
[02:33:00]  A-10 warthogs, they're tank killers.  Is that bad?  Yeah.  They're tank killers.  It's going to leave more than a bruise.  Yeah.  And they found out while they were still in the air, almost immediately.  And this isn't the fake movie pilot talk.  This is relatively young guys in a war situation really feeling for what they fucking just did 
[02:33:30]  in honest language.  See, stuff like this should be able to be played on the news without having to be bleeped or...  Because it's what happened.  It's kind of like, you know, you're not trying to...  This is the last thing you're doing when you play this clip is trying to titillate by using the F-word and stuff.  These guys were just scared shitless, very upset for what happened.  And that's what happened.  How did they get the audio? 
[02:34:00]  Not all this shit's recorded.  But just part of the case now?  And they released it?  I know it's recorded, but how did the media get a hold of it?  They're three years old.  So I guess they're...  A lot of people kind of have it.  Yeah.  The British have it.  There's like a whole thing that goes on over a battle zone that people don't even know.  Like what?  It's like there's planes that work as air traffic control.  You can't just have fucking, like, Warcraft flying all over the fucking place.  There's actually AWACS that are above the battlefield that keep tabs on the planes. 
[02:34:30]  Let them know the altitude.  They're constantly checking.  They work as air traffic control for a war zone.  Wow.  How about that fucking job?  Air traffic control is stressful enough.  How about being an air traffic controller in a war zone?  So they know where all American planes are?  Yeah, they know by the transponders on the planes which planes are good guys, which planes are bad guys for the most part, and where they're going to avoid collision, where they're being sent, where the bad guys are, things like this. 
[02:35:00]  And that's their job is to direct the battle and make sure they stay safe and don't have any traffic accidents up there.  Do the AWACS have weapons on them or just defense weapons?  Only it's all computers.  No, they usually are escorted.  But it's – they're like old – they used to be old Boeing 707s.  Now they – I'm pretty sure they use like old – they look like L-1011s, but I know they're not those.  But they have those things.  You ever see them?  They got the big – looks like a flying saucer on top of them.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Playing with that.  That's what it is.  And it throws a whole picture of what's going on underneath it. 
[02:35:30]  So they have a military escort so that they might get shot at.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  I'm sure they're well taken care of.  So they have to make a lot of circles.  And they fly really high.  A lot of circles in the sky.  Yeah, probably just like flying around over the whole thing as it's happening.  How high?  And then I would say probably up in the 30s.  Yeah, probably up that.  Maybe even higher.  But they're just keeping tabs on everything.  And then the ground, that's kind of all too many times, especially early in battle, is up to the discretion of the pilot. 
[02:36:00]  He's got to call in sometimes for clearance to fire.  But when you're in a war like that and you're sent out to look for certain things, you've got to make sure your target is your target.  And these guys kind of, I think they kind of wanted to shoot something.  Right, right.  And they saw something that was iffy, but they were pretty sure it was the enemy.  And then on a couple of passes, they're like, I don't know, I see like some orange on the sides. 
[02:36:30]  And they knew that the British personnel carriers and armor had orange paint on the sides.  And they're like, no, there's no friendlies up this far north.  And they kind of talked themselves into firing on these guys.  And then they found out, oops, they were Brits.  And then they get really kind of upset and pissed.  Right.  If we play the audio, can I just point out how I was talking to Anthony like he was my uncle?  Like, I mean, are they going to get shot too? 
[02:37:00]  How high were they going?  Like, I was just having a fireside chat with Uncle Ant.  There are a lot of times where we just feel stupid in his presence.  That's okay.  I can't wait for Anthony's wrong calls to come in.  Let's just be honest with each other here.  Might as well just look up and print out AWAC now because somebody will call and call me an asshole.  It pisses me off how smart he is.  I just watch a lot of television when other people are doing things. 
[02:37:30]  I do too, but I don't retain the knowledge you do.  I watch an equal number.  You watch pornography.  And you retain every bit of it.  It's not a hologram.  It's on the television.  It counts.  All right, here we go.  The U.S. pilots hit British forces in Iraq.  The first track here, Spot the Targets.  Hey, dude.  I got a four ship of vehicles.  Hey, dude.  That's something too.  Like, he's like, hey, dude, you got four vehicles.  Like, they're talking like young guys, which is what they are. 
[02:38:00]  But it's not like the movies, you know?  Right, right.  I'm coming in hot.  Hey, dude.  I got a four ship of vehicles that are evenly spaced along the road going north.  Look down at your right, 10 o'clock world.  There's a left 10 o'clock.  If you look down there, they're heading north along that canal right there.  Coming up just south of the village.  There's a small little village, and there's vehicles that are spaced evenly there. 
[02:38:30]  I'm out of pilot.  It looks like there's orange handles on, though. 
[02:39:00]  He told me there's nobody north of here, no friendlies.  I know.  They're right on the river.  Seed vehicles, though.  Might be our original dudes.  Original dudes.  They had strafed something earlier.  So he said, were we strafed?  What's that mean?  The guy goes, gone in with guns, with their guns, and earlier.  So maybe they were thinking it was some of those guys.  But then the guy said, I think I see some orange panels, which would tell them that it was friendlies. 
[02:39:30]  But they still kind of think it out.  I think they're probably since they strafed something earlier, they're pretty pumped up.  So, oof, it's a tough situation.  Is the audio easy to hear for the most part?  Were they shooting mean men?  They were shooting bad people, Jimmy.  Don't be afraid.  They won't shoot you or good people.  Do they shoot guns when they see Santa flying?  No.  Santa has a Santa transponder, which lets them know that it's Santa. 
[02:40:00]  But why didn't they just ask the men, are you mean men because we're supposed to shoot mean men?  Why didn't they just ask them?  Because the mean men probably wouldn't be honest.  That's part of being mean is dishonesty.  See, that's why, Jimmy, you should never, ever lie.  Couldn't they call them on the phone?  No, there aren't any phones out there.  Not to call like phones we have in our house.  You know, like when you try to call the police when I touch you. 
[02:40:30]  I don't call the police.  I just pretend because it makes you touch me a little harder.  Remember one time you thought I called the police and you put my face in the pillow and you said,  I'll give you something to report.  End scene.  I don't think I want to go any further.  But I didn't want to kiss and you put your hand behind my head and you locked your mouth on me.  Oh, my God.  And you kept making this noise. 
[02:41:00]  I'm tapping.  I'm tapping.  You win.  A couple tap outs today, Jimmy.  All right.  Here's waiting for shot confirmation.  Sorry.  Oh, is there a couple of Manila 3, is Manila 3-4 in this area?  Say again.  Manila Hotel, is Manila 3-4 in this area?  Negative.  Understand.  They are well clear of that now.  Uh-oh.  Okay, copy.  Like I said, multiple-dependent vehicles.  They look like flatbed trucks. 
[02:41:30]  Are those your targets?  That and the firm.  Okay.  Hey, um, let me ask you one question.  What's that?  Watch your nose.  And I'm waiting for a shot on that adjustment 8-4 meters north of the previous impact.  Hey, tell me what type of rocket launchers you got up here.  I think there's a rocket launcher.  What do you want me to do this?  I'll tell you we're stepped on, say again.  No, I'll fire your RD up at 800 meters north to see how we do. 
[02:42:00]  I've got a stand-by for a shot.  They're going to need justice to the guns now.  Copy.  All right.  Roll up your right wing.  It looks right underneath you.  I know what you're talking about.  Okay, well, they have orange rockets on them.  Orange rockets?  Yeah, I think so.  Let me look.  See, they're not sure.  Can you explain what's going on there, Ant?  They're trying to get confirmation of the target. 
[02:42:30]  And they're not sure if they're both looking at the same thing.  Okay.  Or if they're both looking at different things.  If they're looking at friendlies or bad guys.  They don't know.  So they're trying to confirm.  At this point, you'd have to, the rational thing to do would be to not fire on this.  Because you're just not fucking sure.  Because you're not sure.  Was the air traffic controller the one that was saying, yeah, like there's a river runs north to south. 
[02:43:00]  Who's just kind of giving them the lowdown of the area?  There are a couple of planes up there.  So it's talking, they're talking plane to plane.  I think there's also a ground controller that's talking to these guys that will eventually give some kind of clearance to fire on whatever they're looking at.  So there's more than just the plane involved that shot them.  Do they yell out the window to each other?  No, no.  There are no real windows. 
[02:43:30]  You shouldn't roll down the window.  Like in a car, there are windows.  And you roll them down like that.  But no, no.  And these aircraft, no.  All right.  We've got an expert on the line.  Let's say hi to Kirby.  Kirby.  Hi, guys.  Hi, Kirby.  I worked on AWACS every day for three years.  And I can answer some questions if you have any specific ones, Anthony.  Oh.  No.  How high do they fly?  They fly typically, you know, 20,000, 22,000 feet. 
[02:44:00]  It's normally, you know, they try to keep high above everything so they're not in the danger with the zone.  And so they can keep a good eye.  Well, Anthony says they fly 35,000 feet.  So I guess we're going to have to agree to disagree.  I agree.  I know that they're pretty much kind of decked out passenger planes.  Right.  They're all Boeing 707s.  They still use those?  Holy shit.  Why the fuck don't they use something new? 
[02:44:30]  They don't need it.  The maintenance on those things is probably fantastic.  God.  Well, the technology in the planes is from the late 70s, early 80s.  There's really nothing groundbreaking inside them.  They're all very old.  And they were talking about updates right before I left, but nothing too big.  They don't even have mice.  They have old computers with track balls and very, very primitive display systems.  But, I mean, it gets the job done.  It does everything you need it to do.  So why that's great?  You used to see them years ago flying over, like, Long Island stuff. 
[02:45:00]  You used to actually see them during the Vietnam War.  What were you doing?  Going to the high school dance?  No, I was a kid.  How old are you?  I was a child, and I thought it looked like a flying saucer would land it on an airplane.  You've been fooling me for 12 years.  How old are you?  They would rotate on top.  The radar array actually spins on top of the plane.  So it looked like a flying saucer on top of them.  And when I was a kid, you used to see those things flying all the time over Long Island. 
[02:45:30]  Gene Shepard didn't die.  He just fucking learned to do a Tyson impression.  I like to fall back.  Dogshit Sniffer from Woodside.  The audio, you know, with them trying to figure out, you know, if it's a target or not or whatever.  He writes, this is like Jimmy cruising for trannies.  Not really sure.  Yeah.  Yeah, it's wearing an orange.  It's, I don't know.  I'm cruising by again.  I'm going to take another pass.  I see, is that a big back? 
[02:46:00]  If you've got problems identifying this, go around another pass in the Saturn.  It should be right under your left window.  Roll that down and take a look.  Roger that.  I'm looking, and I don't see a bulge in the front.  I don't see a bulge.  Roger that.  How about an Adam's apple?  Any Adam's apple?  I'm going to have to spin around and take another look.  But I might just have to pick this one up.  I think I'm just going to go with the pickup. 
[02:46:30]  Roger that.  What?  New information.  It's got a cock.  Oh, fuck.  We're fucked.  We're fucked.  Mm-hmm.  I got to wash man smell off of my cock.  But Jimmy had it, though.  Too late.  They get out of that shit.  That's right.  Man smelling your dick, sissy girl.  Damn it.  Here's the first shots fired. 
[02:47:00]  It looks like they are exactly what we're talking about.  Can we get them in?  Okay, I want to get the first one.  Can we get to that town, then?  Get him.  Get him.  All right.  We've got the rocket launchers, it looks like.  Number two is rolling in from the south to the north.  And I choose him.  Get him.  Pick out the lead guy. 
[02:47:30]  That, by the way, is the cannon.  I'm off your west.  Two hits.  Two hits.  Yeah, those things are ridiculous.  If you ever watched any of the Discovery Channel shows on the A-10 Warthog, the guns that they have are devastating.  Depleted uranium rounds that just go eat through tanks. 
[02:48:00]  They will just fucking eat through a tank.  And then who's ever in there is just getting Swiss cheesed by the fucking fragments banging around inside the tank.  Oh, they go right through it, huh?  Oh, right through it.  It's ridiculous.  And it's so cool to watch.  This is like the sound of one of the cannons of it.  Here's a regular machine gun from the ground.  You know, your regular.  Standard.  Chew him up on the ground. 
[02:48:30]  You can hear each shot, pretty much.  Here is one of the cannons from the A-10.  Oh, jeez.  That's just a...  Is it just spinning and just fucking kicking bolts?  Yeah, it's just spinning and firing, flaming death.  Actually, that was raining down.  That was actually audio from Tyra Banks after she had a meal.  Daddy party!  Oh, excuse me.  Bloop, bloop.  All right. 
[02:49:00]  Why do you got cooking in your oven over here?  Oh, God.  That's coal sounding, man.  Yeah.  Weapons rule.  Can we hear that again, please?  That little fucking...  Yeah, oh.  Ah, I love it.  Weapons and war would be great if people didn't get killed.  If America didn't get killed.  Ah, Bill is adding in.  The gun actually slows down the plane.  Just from the power of launching the shells out of it. 
[02:49:30]  Oh, my God.  It is ridiculous.  Would they shoot, like, 22 shells?  And they could carry bombs.  Yeah, a little 22.  Actually, you could load them up with BBs.  But they got to have a guy in the back that actually has to pump it, pump it, pump the  air pressure up.  How big are the bullets they shoot?  What caliber are those?  It's, like, ridiculous.  It's about the size of your cock.  It's a fucking four caliber?  Right there.  A little.  Yeah, I'm not sure of the exact caliber.  But really, it's...  It's...  When you see them, they are as big as... 
[02:50:00]  Probably that Poland spring bottle right there is the actual...  It's a bullet?  ...part that comes out of it.  Yeah, it's just ridiculous.  Oh, my God.  Can you imagine?  All right, here we go.  Second shot fired.  And there's the clip where they confirm that it was friendly fire.  What's up, you guys?  He's calling ass.  Laugh.  Is that the way you think they are?  One, two. 
[02:50:30]  It's a little bit friendly.  There's a man again from the south.  Okay.  Searching.  Pop-pop, 3-4, and Lady 3-4.  Pop-pop, 3-5, Lady 3-4, go.  Roger, Pop-pop.  May be advised that in the 3-1, this 2-2, and 3-2, 2-2 group box, 
[02:51:00]  you have friendly armor in the area.  Yellow, small armored tanks.  Just be advised.  Yeah, that's a...  Oh, shit.  Yeah.  Got this, got this, smoke.  Hey, Pop-pop, 3-4, aboard your mission.  You've got, uh, looks like we may have a blue-on-blue situation.  All right.  God bless it.  Pop-pop, 3-4.  It isn't heavier.  Fuck.  Fuck.  Fuck.  Pop-pop, 3-4, this is Modelo, 3-4. 
[02:51:30]  You copied my last, over.  I did.  I'm, uh, Pom-Dell-Ducks on the northern side, uh, north.  Forms, those are friendlies on that side of the canal.  Shit.  Stand by, Pop-pop.  Northwest, southeast.  God damn it.  You think the guy thought about just, like, you know, nose-diving the plane at this point?  Like, fuck.  I mean, that happens in war.  It sucks, though, because the brits are... 
[02:52:00]  You know what the thing is?  It was the fact that they had their doubts.  It was one of those things where they were like, eh, well, let's take a look, and then  you fire, and then you're told that, oh, you did fuck up.  Eek.  What are happening to these guys?  Any, uh, update on that?  Um, well, we got a little more audio.  I'm not really sure what's going on with them today.  Yeah, we'll find out.  Uh, this is where they get, uh, even worse news.  Okay, Pop-Pop, just, uh, west of the 3-4 Easting, on the, uh, on the berm up there, the 
[02:52:30]  3-4-2-2 area is where we have, uh, our friendlies.  Over.  All right, Pop-Pop 3-5 has smoke.  Uh, let me know how those friendlies are right now, please.  Roger, stand by.  Gotta go home, dude.  Yeah, I know that one.  All right.  Yeah.  Pop-Pop 3-5 is bingo.  Please let us know what's happening.  Roger, we're getting that information right now.  Stand by. 
[02:53:00]  Fuck.  And Pop-Pop, this is, uh, vanilla 3-4.  Confirm air altitude.  Go.  And those people are going to go for Pop-Pop.  Roger, we're getting an initial, uh, brief that there was, uh, one killed and one wounded.  Over.  I'm gonna be sick.  Ah, fuck. 
[02:53:30]  Yeah.  Peter?  Yeah, this sucks.  We're in jail, dude.  We're in jail, dude.  Ah!  Wow.  Oh, is he fucking pissed.  Oh, is he pissed at himself.  That's unbelievable.  Yeah.  That's one of those situations.  What do you do?  What do you do?  They're, they're fucked as it is. 
[02:54:00]  I don't think you get back in your fucking plane.  Hey, go off on another mission.  I think your career's pretty much fucked.  That's their version of St. Pat's.  Yeah.  They, uh, the Air Force did an investigation, but the results were not publicly released.  Um, but the investigation did not resort, result in a court-martial.  Oh, it didn't?  No.  Yeah.  But their careers are completely fucked.  Yeah, that's, you know. 
[02:54:30]  They don't court-martial you, but, you know, the military deals with shit like that.  You'll be flying a desk!  That's it.  He'll be at a fucking recruiter's office trying to talk kids into fucking joining.  All right.  We got a little more audio.  We're bestered.  Hello, I'll repeat from TwinAct.  The 8-10s are working.  I'm running on Sunrise.  Over.  Papa 3-5, Papa 3-5, this is Costa 5-8 relay message from TwinAct.  Abort, abort.  Abort.  Hello, I'll copy. 
[02:55:00]  The 8-10s are running on Sunrise.  Abort, over.  From TwinAct, abort, abort.  Papa 3-5, aborting.  What's the 5-8 so we'll relay that back to TwinAct.  Fuck.  God fucking shit.  God fucking shit.  How calm is the British guy?  It's like one of my posts.  What the boat?  We're being fired upon.  Could you please stop it? 
[02:55:30]  Yes, we need to go.  Abort, abort, abort.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Rather.  And then finally this.  They didn't say they were no friendlies.  Yeah, I know.  I think the orange panel should go through this.  They look like orange rockets on top.  There you go.  That is some unbelievable audio, isn't it?  Yeah, it's amazing. 
[02:56:00]  What's wrong, Ed?  Oh, no, thank you.  Oh, okay.  You know, just missed the moment.  Did they say they were sorry?  Yeah, I bet they did.  Why'd the man use bathroom talk?  I can never find anything.  Shit.  You're using bathroom language.  I need all my Steve highlights.  My Steve bits highlighted.  I can never find them.  Oh, my goodness.  Oh, my God. 
[02:56:30]  Timing's everything.  Hey, there's one more clip.  It's of the pilot once he landed.  That's terrible.  I'm sorry.  And now the co-pilot wants to help him.  No, nothing's wrong.  Just stay in the living room.  I'll handle it.  Why are they back at home? 
[02:57:00]  What?  What did he say when he saw the other guy was still in his cockpit?  And he wanted him to...  Get the fuck out.  Now.  And, of course, he very solemnly visited the family,  which included children of the lost soldiers.  How'd your parents die?  Oh, my God.  Both parents were in there.  Yes, it was tragic.  Talk about tragic irony.  Oh, my God.  You've got to be kidding me. 
[02:57:30]  No, no, no, no, no, no, no.  No, he's not kidding.  All right, well.  Now, here's some from the cockpit.  He's very angry.  Grr.  Grr.  You just hear the anger in his voice when he found out.  Grr.  Grr.  And here's his plane.  Grr.  Grr.  Grr.  Grr.  Grr.  Grr.  Grr.  Grr.  Grr.  Grr.  Grr.  Grr.  Grr.  No, no, no.  Flight of the Steve.  All right, we're going to change gears here.  All right, it's Mike in Boston.  What's up, Mike?  Hey, guys.  What's going on?  Hey there, Mike. 
[02:58:00]  You're on the Opie and Anthony Show.  What's up?  All right, yeah, I just wanted to call and thank Jimmy for all the whore talk.  I got a prostitute last night.  It was a great experience.  Good boy.  Wait, first time ever?  First time, sir.  Why a prostitute, sir?  Because they fuck you for money.  Why not?  Why not?  I thought it was a dual banker.  Do you have a problem getting broads?  You know what?  I just don't have the time.  Had time.  I'm calling my way back home.  Where'd you get her?  How old are you?  I'm 24. 
[02:58:30]  We're trying to get to know you a little bit.  Married?  Girlfriend?  Any of that stuff going on?  No, single.  Single?  Were you on the road?  Hometown?  What's up?  No, I was coming back from work at about 1, and on my regular route home, this girl waved  to me.  I turned around, said hi.  She wanted to know if I wanted to have any fun.  I said, hop in the car.  And then we started negotiating.  It was $20 for a blowjob. 
[02:59:00]  I was actually pretty happy about that.  Cheap.  What state was this?  $20 for a Hummer in this damage?  This was actually a roll.  A roll mass.  Wow.  There you go.  $20.  $20.  And then $80 for full service?  Yeah.  Did she throw rubber on you?  Excuse me?  Did she put a rubber on you?  No, sir.  Where'd you come?  Actually, I came on the outside.  I didn't bust in her.  On the outside?  Oh, you fucked her?  Yeah.  Without a condom?  Yeah, why not?  Jimmy does it.  Yeah, why not? 
[02:59:30]  Jimmy does it.  I can do it.  Jimmy does it.  I love the way Jimmy's inspiring our listeners to live a safe...  We don't need our listeners disappearing.  We need everyone we can get.  It just can't happen to me.  It can't happen to me.  That's right.  It's all right, Opie.  By the time he gets it and actually dies from it, we'll be retired.  Yeah, we'll be retired.  Yeah.  You'll be in Arizona.  Exactly.  You could be...  I don't know where I'll be.  I'll...  I don't know about Arizona.  AZ in the house.  I don't know.  Yeah.  It's got to be warm.  But it's got to be America. 
[03:00:00]  That's Florida.  Hawaii.  Florida's a little too warm.  Hawaii's too far from everything.  How about inside Eric's asshole?  It's warm.  Hey, uh...  In America.  Mike, so she was just on the corner as you're driving through?  Yeah.  I was stopped at a light, and I looked at my rearview mirror.  And she's waving at me.  So I turned around at the light.  And Jimmy got you to do this, huh?  Jimmy kind of planted the seed.  And so did you, apparently.  Yeah.  Right.  And where did you...  I love his back.  Where did you end up having sex with her? 
[03:00:30]  Like behind a building, your house?  Where'd you go?  Yeah, I ended up just driving around my house.  Did you kiss her?  There's a little firehouse around there.  Did you kiss her?  In the morning, I figured no one would see me.  Was she hot?  Did you kiss her?  No, no kissing, but actually she was pretty fuckable.  80 bucks.  80 bucks.  Cheap.  80 beans.  All right.  Was she happy?  Uh, she's a whore.  Did you turn her on, or was it fake turn-on?  Ooh. 
[03:01:00]  Uh, sounded like a fake turn-on.  Did she have ass spiders?  Uh, pretty dark in the car.  Couldn't really tell.  Did her pussy smell?  Uh, didn't smell it.  Black broad?  White.  Ooh.  White crack whore.  Nice.  Yeah.  Crystal meth.  Probably crystal meth, right?  Meth whore.  Huh?  Yeah.  Looked like she could have been using.  All right.  Well, there you go.  All right, guys.  I just wanted to say thanks.  Be good, man.  Thanks to Jimmy, right?  All right.  There goes Mike in Boston.  A little more cockpit. 
[03:01:30]  Oh, no.  Oh, dear Lord Jesus, this ain't happening, man.  This can't be happening, man.  This ain't happening.  Well, that's great.  That's just fucking great, man.  Now, what the fuck are we supposed to do?  Where's the real pretty shit now, man?  Sorry, I just love the clips.  Yeah.  Great movie.  All right.  Push a break.  Anthony, uncle.  Oh, yes.  I have to make.  You have to make potty?  I'll go with you. 
[03:02:00]  As always.  And you know what I'm going to do?  You better get your head and your ass wired together, or I will take a giant shit on you.  Right here in the bathroom.  Remember we were camping and there was no potty?  So you said that your mouth was suffice?  Jesus, man.  That last bit of cockpit audio.  Oh, fuck this idiot.  I'm a fucking idiot.  I'm a fucking idiot.  I'm a fucking idiot.  I'm a fucking idiot.  Yeah, I'm a co-pilot.  You look like assholes right now, man.  Hello, exactly. 
[03:02:30]  Wait, what the heck are you guys doing?  Trying to ruin my life and make me look like a freaking idiot?  You folks fell on your face.  You get an F minus in my book.  What is that from?  That was some Hurricane Katrina, right?  Yep.  Yeah, how they handled the situation.  Hey, who did the Tyra Banks sign?  I'm getting a communique from a press outlet.  They want to give the POW proper credit.  Oh, okay.  His name was Jewish something.  Jewish what?  Monkey, I think.  Jewish, his name is Jewish Monkey. 
[03:03:00]  Jewish Monkey.  That's his name.  Jewish.  Oh, this is going to be hilarious when this is in print.  Jewish.  I think it's going to be on Friday Morning Quarterback.  It's Jewish Monkey.  Pilots didn't sound very professional either.  Why?  We have clearance, Clarence.  Roger, Roger.  What's our vector, Victor?  You ever seen a grown man naked?  Surely you can't be serious.  I am serious.  And don't call me Shirley.  You know what they say.  See you, bro.  They get that booty, yackle.  Leg it down.  Snack them, yackle. 
[03:03:30]  Coe got to be.  That's terrible.  I'm sorry.  I see pipes in a lot, doesn't it?  It certainly does.  Are they verbose?  All right.  We've got to take leaks.  I want to go out there and enjoy all the energy in the next room.  Jesus, those two dead people.  One of the Brits had a good luck charm and kept hearing this sound.  Obviously tragic.  All right.  There will always be retarded idiots to entertain us with this stupidity.  Mindless. 
[03:04:00]  Crotch grabbing.  Anthony.  Mindless.  Opie.  Crotch grabbing.  Anthony.  People grabbing their crotches and saying, suck it.  The Opie and Anthony show.  Suck it.  Love the show.  Mindless and mindless and mindless and mindless and mindless.  Opie and Anthony.  How dare you.  How dare you now anyway.  How dare you.  How dare you.  That's pretty funny, actually.  It's the Opie and Anthony show. 
[03:04:30]  We're taking a look at some material here.  Laura Korn's going to be in studio in about a week.  I'm digging this book.  What's wrong, Ed?  It's my painter.  Hi, sir.  I'm on the air right now.  Anthony says you're a size queen.  Yeah.  Anthony says you're on the air.  Call him back, faggot.  Call him back.  Why don't you paint your face with my cock?  When people call me, they want fucking yelling.  Anthony wants you to make a pass.  How about I paint your asshole with my prick? 
[03:05:00]  You fucking painter.  We'll paint each other up.  Watch your finger paint inside a little vagina.  Watch your finger paint my asshole, you whore.  I'll call you when I get home.  Yeah, painting is for dick suckers.  You dick sucker painter.  Where did it all go wrong that you're painting Anthony's house?  Exactly.  I'm getting more of a sucker to smell it later.  Yeah.  My friends.  Yeah.  Why don't you paint the toilet seat with your tongue, shit dick?  Me and my knee for wonderful wallpaper. 
[03:05:30]  Anthony hates Jews and wallpaper.  Thank you, sir.  I'll contact you later.  Bye.  I'm going to need a new painter.  Why?  I don't know.  He didn't sound very entertained by everything that was going on here.  Fuck.  Why?  What's your fault?  He came highly recommended because it didn't say the number.  Usually it says the number of...  Oh, no.  I need a new painter.  Listen.  Damn it.  So we're looking at the Laura Korn... 
[03:06:00]  Yeah, what's with the board game?  It's a board game.  Oh, it's set up like...  First of all, the board looks like Trivial Pursuit a little bit.  It does not be where you can cross in the middle.  It's just a round circle.  Let's all do this and have to do to each other what turns up on the board.  That'll be fun.  We need a girl.  Travis, come on.  Bring that cat.  Oh, that's a bit.  Wait, for her eyes only, I get a...  Is someone eating egg whites right now or did someone just fart?  I can never tell.  Holy shit.  No, you know what it was? 
[03:06:30]  We were talking about planes.  I was scared that I was going to get shot by a plane.  Sam, Sam, you got to help me.  I was scared.  You were pushing out some courage.  That was courage forcing out my fear so I could endure.  What the fuck is this?  Holy shit.  Oh, what's the matter?  That game stinks.  Oh, it's Jimmy.  Oh, come on.  Don't be fresh.  Let me see some cards.  How do you play?  All right, here's some cards.  Give me some cards. 
[03:07:00]  I want to play with the cards open.  Here's your cards.  Fucking wailed it.  I'm like a Chinese star.  Why did you throw my cards hard?  Why does it say up against the wall?  Obstacle card.  I don't know what this means.  Lazy boy, busy girl.  The cat technique.  Oral override.  The pizza man always rings twice.  Massage, collage.  All right, how does it work?  Fan rules?  Yes.  You got some rules?  All right.  Yes, this mic takes one second to turn on. 
[03:07:30]  Oh, there you go.  Object of the game.  Players move their markers around the game board, competing to collect secret sealed seduction  cards.  Oh, are they supposed to be secretly sealed?  Yeah, well, I got one.  Okay.  Okay.  The first player to collect five secret sealed seduction cards is declared the winner.  And then what happens?  The winner chooses to either seduce their lover or be seduced.  What is this for fucking people with nine kids?  Who fucking gets off on this? 
[03:08:00]  The seducer must then open the secret sealed seduction card chosen by the winner and follow  the instructions inside.  Uh-huh.  One seduction for now and one for later.  I want to do one for now.  Now, what are the rest of the spots on the board?  Yeah.  What's the question mark and the little, like...  Moving around the board.  It's kind of like Monopoly, but if you land on the thing normally in jail, you have to  get AIDS during the game.  To get AIDS free. 
[03:08:30]  The question mark is a trivia question.  Okay.  Where's the question?  Where are the questions?  Where's the trivia questions?  I don't see questions.  There's a notepad.  These aren't trivia questions.  These aren't trivia questions.  Mine just says, these are the tips.  These are supposed to be the hidden fucking panty roulettes.  Trivia questions?  Your partner should pick up their sexual trivia book.  Where's that?  Where's the sexual trivia book?  Oh, I've got it.  Sexual trivia book.  Book.  That's a pamphlet.  All right.  For his eyes only. 
[03:09:00]  Oh, give me the his.  You take the hers, bitch.  Oh, boy.  You want me to read some of these questions?  Yeah, please.  Would you like to?  All right.  Yeah, throw it for hers.  I was the only two.  Let's see how awful the advice is.  All right.  We're done.  Here.  Oh, Anthony wanted it.  No, he didn't.  Jimmy, get it.  You wanted Anthony?  I'll give it to you.  No.  I want one of those red things.  What's that?  On average, how many couples are having sex in the world at any given moment?  I would say, let's see. 
[03:09:30]  Where are the answers, Stan?  One.  Hopefully, they're upside down in the back.  Two, a hundred, and fifty million people.  Nope.  Let me guess.  Mm-hmm.  Mm-hmm.  Mm-hmm.  Seventeen.  On average, how many couples are having sex in the world at any given moment?  If you said 100 million, you are correct.  I said 250 million.  So you're very over, so I win because you were over.  Oh. 
[03:10:00]  Oh.  I was only off by 100 million.  You were off by 150 million.  That's true.  How much is that in batches?  He said 17, and he's closer?  I said 17 couples, and I won by a lot.  I did this research.  Yeah.  I won by 50 million.  You did?  Wow.  According to the great sex survey, what are men putting down their pants in the morning  to turn on women in the evening?  A wallet?  Anti-onion smell?  Baby powder. 
[03:10:30]  I'm closer.  That's more questions.  Let's play the game.  I want to go around the board.  I don't want you.  It's like Candyland.  You fly down into a barren uterus.  They're so weak.  Poop shoots and ladders.  What part of the U.S. boasts the highest percentage of women who masturbate regularly?  What's that?  What part of the U.S. boasts the highest percentage of women who masturbate regularly?  I'm going to guess the cunt. 
[03:11:00]  West Coast, South, or Northeast?  I would say Northeast.  No.  Give me a bail.  Did I get a buzzer, too?  North?  You got a buzzer on there somewhere, I think.  I want to guess.  Northeast.  Northeast.  I knew it.  Northeast for Anthony.  So I get to open up one of the...  No.  No.  I'm just opening these random willy-nilly.  Wait, but everyone has to guess because...  You know how Laura hates when we open up her things?  Yeah.  I'm opening up barely legal.  Slave time I have. 
[03:11:30]  This is going to be easy.  Pearl necklace or your best strand of beads?  Have you ever been given a pearl necklace before?  No, not that kind.  Getting it out of your mind.  Out of the gutter.  I mean, a real pearl necklace.  A luminescent bunch of beads.  Well, now you can use your pearls to remind him what kind of a lady you are.  Wind a string of pearls around his erection and tug.  Use the smooth, lovely strand to pull his penis toward your waiting mouth.  Grasp one end of the strand in each hand and slide it left, then right, 
[03:12:00]  spinning one or two gleaming loops against his shaft in a snug spiral.  Rub it up and down frenetically to really whip him into a fever pitch.  Twirl high and low, fast and slow, massaging his erection with a hundred tiny fingers  and two warm lips.  Diamonds are a girl's best friend, but your guy just fell in love with pearls.  Diamonds. 
[03:12:30]  Matt from New York City.  That's terrible.  I'm sorry.  Matt from New York City wants to know if the game's called Hungry Hungry Nymphos.  Wait, this is a good one, too.  All right?  It's called Slave Time.  Ooh.  And it says, congratulations, you have not only won this game,  you have just won this special grand prize.  Your new mate owes you an hour of slave time.  Oh.  For the next 60 minutes, you can ask her to do anything.  Obviously, there's no pain.  So how to start?  Get black spray paint. 
[03:13:00]  Make her lift her gums and show you her teeth.  Make her sleep in the basement and throw up the par at your feet her.  Then fuck her and beat her for seducing you.  I got another question for you guys.  All right.  Who said, I need sex like I need food?  Oh.  Was it Madonna, Monica Lewinsky, or Barbara Streisand?  I say Karen Carpenter.  That would be Barbara Streisand. 
[03:13:30]  Fail.  That's correct.  Sissy.  New Babs.  I just guessed.  Which sexy lingerie do nine out of ten men say they like best?  A noose.  Garrett in a cowboy hat. 
[03:14:00]  It's A, a silk teddy.  B, garter and belt stockings.  C, a dress shirt and panties.  Dress shirt and panties?  What is she in a fucking brute commercial?  Oh, Jesus.  That's awful.  Dress shirt and panties.  And a mullet.  I don't know.  I say thigh highs.  Thigh highs, what was the other one?  A dress shirt and panties.  Oh, that's the only choice?  The two?  Yeah.  Who wants a teddy?  Yeah, yeah.  Thigh highs.  Fucking, who wants the teddy? 
[03:14:30]  The Mary Jo chick?  No way.  Stop.  Stop.  Don't even press that.  No.  A dress shirt and panties?  That would have been the answer.  You know what I'd love to see a woman wearing?  One of these.  Oh, very nice.  Right in her face.  Wear that.  Ah, this is, uh, uh, there is only one animal along with humans that has sex for pleasure.  Name that animal.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Yeah, there's so many. 
[03:15:00]  Um.  I say that's going to be the, uh.  What?  Um.  Uh, the sea urchin.  Sex for pleasure?  Yeah.  I would have to say the chimpanzee.  The gorilla.  The fucking.  The whale.  Of, uh, dolphin. 
[03:15:30]  The dolphin.  Fuck.  I know I should have went in that direction.  Uh, sexual oddity.  If you're in bed with a Z-E-L-I-O-phelic.  And I want.  Zileophilic.  Zileophilic.  You already know what the answer is.  What are you in, uh, what are you in for tonight?  A lot of zileo.  Whipped cream, leather, or jealousy?  Uh.  Whipped cream. 
[03:16:00]  Jealousy.  Jealousy.  One right, one wrong.  You just agree to disagree, Jimmy.  Well, I think it's Z-E-A-L, right?  Z-E-A-L.  Uh.  It's jealousy.  You're right.  Aw.  You're good.  All right.  Whatever.  Should we, uh.  Uh, men love bad girls part one.  Get his attention.  This is what you need.  One part lady.  One part slut.  And one cell phone.  Go to the bedroom and call from your cell phone.  A-a-a-a-m. 
[03:16:30]  Hi, baby.  I was just thinking about you.  I was thinking about going down on you right now.  Would you like that?  Men love bad girls part two.  Turn him into a blubbering idiot and sexual servant.  Ooh.  I just touched myself and I'm so wet.  Why don't you come down here to the bedroom?  Down here to the bedroom.  Wow.  Men love bad girls part three.  Get anything you want.  I need you inside me.  In my mouth. 
[03:17:00]  Please put it in me.  I need to feel it so bad.  Part three.  He might be speechless.  But don't let that stop you from talking like the wicked dirty girl you secretly are.  That's what you're going to open up if you get five fucking...  Got another question for you.  You got to answer five...  Whoa, question.  A cell phone from this nudge.  You don't need to call.  Especially like...  They don't tell you what his response is.  Like she'll call and go, I'm down here. 
[03:17:30]  I need you inside me.  And he's like, look, I'm upstairs molesting our daughter.  Can I get back to you?  According to...  Goes to voicemail.  According to...  Wounds to her whole fucking sexual moment.  If you'd like to suck his cock, press one.  Hello.  Hi, I look so fucking horny.  I'd like to...  Please leave a message.  When you hear the tone, I'll try to get back to you.  If this is about sucking my cock, press one.  According to a recent survey, what two words do men want to hear most from their lovers in bed? 
[03:18:00]  I'm dead.  Oh, where's Adam?  Right.  A little appropriate.  I'm sick. 
[03:18:30]  That hurt.  Oh, Dad.  What is the emergency kiss?  Hmm, the emergency kiss?  You kiss the open palm of your lover's hand, then roll up the fingers, making a fist. 
[03:19:00]  Oh.  Then say...  Put this up your cunt.  Is it open just in case of emergency?  Yeah.  How about the emergency load?  Are you shirk off into her hand?  You kiss her palm, and then you close it into a fist, and you say, bring this to your hot girlfriend,  and slap it on her cunt.  Oh, wow. 
[03:19:30]  It's funny.  What can a woman put in her mouth to engorge a man's penis and increase his pleasure during  world sex?  Shot to him.  A log?  Oh, shit. 
[03:20:00]  All right.  What's the answer?  I don't know.  If my fingers were his bag?  Shit.  Warm liquid.  Which of the following fantasies is the most common among men?  A three-way?  Being dominated?  Or being tied up?  It's got to be the three-way, but that's too obvious, so it's going to be something that  isn't really true, which is something like being tied up.  I say being dominated. 
[03:20:30]  Men are dominant in life all day.  Jimmy.  Jimmy with being dominated.  Yeah, I know about men.  I don't know about women.  Let's see.  He's smart.  Oh.  Ew.  Jimmy's like as smart with cock as I am with aircraft.  Well, here's a great pop culture question.  Who said a man might forget where he lives, but he never forgets oral sex, no matter how  bad it is? 
[03:21:00]  Reagan?  Steve C.?  Was it Cher?  Barbara Bush?  Or Madonna?  Oh, is it?  That's got to be Madonna.  Barbara Bush.  Shut the fuck up.  What's a lie?  Who's fucking...  Who's evaluating these for accuracy?  That bitch could write anything she wants.  Let's see. 
[03:21:30]  There might be some girl ones we could do, because we're down from the men's point of view.  Should everyone?  Yeah.  Jimmy's got the girl's book.  Oh, good.  Where's the answers?  They're at the bottom of the page.  Oh, sure they are.  I've got to suck off so I can't get the fucking answer.  I'm trying to open these fucking stupid things.  They're impossible.  Leading question.  What does Cupid dip the tips of arrows in before shooting them into star-crossed lovers?  Arsenic. 
[03:22:00]  Robert Reed's stool sample.  Very good, Ed.  Here's a Petri dish of liquefied shit.  Tip, tip, tip, tip, tip.  What percentage of adults play with sex toys on a regular basis?  Percentage?  Less than 10.  20 to 30 percent.  C, 50 percent.  I would say 50 percent.  50 percent plus. 
[03:22:30]  Good job, Ed.  If I get to answer one of these and try something to do with them.  I don't care.  Who invented the peep show in 1894?  Charles D. Peep.  This is a surprise.  What year?  1894.  1894.  Thomas Hedison.  Actually, it was Thomas Edison. 
[03:23:00]  No way.  Yeah, who knew that?  Thomas Hedison.  Did not know that.  I'm reading these and they're all just...  Look, in the hot seat.  That's a sexual thing to do if you win.  Ingredients.  An armless chair or stool.  I hope she means a seat. 
[03:23:30]  Not for Jimmy.  Nothing sexier than a woman who knows exactly what she wants.  You're running the show with this seduction.  And never let your man forget that.  Place an armless chair or a stool in the middle of the bedroom.  Better yet, in the middle of the kitchen or the backyard.  Order him to sit down.  And while he's seated, walk around him slowly,  removing one item of clothing with each revolution.  His head will be turning 360 degrees.  After you're naked, walk over to him and start removing his clothes.  Rip his shirt off so the buttons fly across the room.  Kiss a line down the center of his chest. 
[03:24:00]  All the way downtown.  When he's hard and ready, put him inside you.  Wrap your legs around him.  This is your show, ladies.  So take control.  Pump him into submission.  He'll never be able to look at the chair the same way again.  That's stupid.  The armless chair.  The only one you have is the Fisher-Price one that your kid does with fucking the little  Easy Bakes toys on.  You can't fit in it.  It works for gay couples. 
[03:24:30]  You just turn the stool over.  That old gag.  Invite over three friends.  All right.  Survey says, when do most men see women as being at their very sexiest?  Don't say fucking when they're pregnant.  While she's cooking?  After a shower?  When she's on all fours?  When do most men see women as being at their very sexiest?  Right after a shower.  I'm going to say D. 
[03:25:00]  After anal sex, when you're wiping your shit-covered dick in a towel.  You can't add your own answers, Jimmy.  You can.  I was co-authored.  Hey, what happened to the phones?  Did everyone go away, or did we blow up the phones again?  No ring-a-ding-a-dingy.  We're getting no phone calls?  No, that usually means we're on to something.  Hopefully.  That means the phones blew up.  Yeah.  Let's see.  Who cares? 
[03:25:30]  Who cares?  What percentage of women admit to shaving their pubic hair?  25, 45, or 65?  65.  What age, though?  10.  45%.  That's who cares.  Ugh.  If a woman is known as a buckle bunny, what does she enjoy doing?  Just collapsing under pressure?  Dressing in a bunny suit, putting marshmallows in his mouth, and sticky wax up his asshole? 
[03:26:00]  Wait, what is she known as a...  A buckle bunny.  Um, it's either getting hit with a belt, or, um, or, um, she's, uh, almost black.  Give me a hand on it.  In the whole wide world, there's nothing sexier than a woman who's half-dressed and completely aroused. 
[03:26:30]  Hand him a candle, already lit.  Tell him to meet you in the bathroom in five minutes.  When he walks in, he may stop breathing for a moment.  You're in one of his white button-downs, every button undone.  With your laciest, sexiest panties peeking out, your bare skin is glowing by the candlelight.  A wicked smile on his face.  You're wearing one of his business shirts.  And, honey, all, you're all business.  It's a fantasy come to life.  A scene he'll never forget.  Now, ravish, ravish him?  In the soft light. 
[03:27:00]  Rip his shirt off.  Push him against the wall and wrap your legs around him tightly.  Or maybe you want to shove him into the shower, soap up your breasts, and let him fondle your exquisite wet form.  Show him that life with you is always fun, often unpredictable, and getting better all the time.  That's funny.  When he walks in the bathroom, he won't be able to breathe because you're shitting.  So now hand him a match to get the smell.  Have him light the candle with a match to get the smell out of the bathroom.  That's right. 
[03:27:30]  According, take my shirt off, bitch.  I want to see my shirt.  Let him gently wipe your shitty ass with the toilet paper.  With the tail of his own shirt.  The tail of his business shirt.  And then have him smell it.  Let him stick a finger up your shitter after you've taken a dump so the smell of you will linger on him for a week straight.  Let him soap up your one good remaining breast.  Oh, my God.  That's this one called the Olivia Newton John.  All right, hold on.  Here we go.  According to surveys, which sexual position do men prefer most? 
[03:28:00]  Yes.  This is terrible.  According to surveys, which sexual position do men prefer most?  Oh, there's no multiple choice? 
[03:28:30]  I was hoping for an answer, D.  Oh, okay.  Sexual position.  Well, I'll give you what they got.  A, man on top.  B, woman on top.  C, man from behind.  D, looking nervously over his shoulder in a coffin.  Which day in a woman's 28-day cycle is she the most sexually aggressive and attractive to the opposite sex? 
[03:29:00]  In 28 days?  Which one is she most sexually attractive?  I don't know.  It don't matter.  What do guys fantasize about more?  Nude women, women in lingerie, women in stilettos.  Or D, a feminine boy holding a cat. 
[03:29:30]  Women in a blue tarp.  In a rowboat.  Okay.  It's so, like, stupid fucking staged, like...  The only thing sexy than being naked is being nearly naked, but swathed in the smooth fabric imaginable. 
[03:30:00]  Silk on the skin.  There's nothing like it.  Walk into the bedroom wearing a silk scarf around your neck and woven into your hair, tied around your waist, whatever.  And nothing else.  Your man will be all hot and bothered immediately.  Probably be bothered.  I know.  Hey, Amelia Earhart, what are you doing?  She's on a period.  She's on a period, so he calls her the Red Parent.  Well, she's had a hysterectomy.  Take the scarf off, tied around the base of his erect penis, and then take... 
[03:30:30]  The other end, tied to the bumper.  The bottom of his erect penis.  Unless he's busy working security.  Now add some gentle friction, slide the loop around slower, then faster, a little looser, a little snug.  Do you know how fucking... 
[03:31:00]  That's like a...  That's the Indian way to make fire.  Right, you're starting a fire.  How are you fucking rubbing a silk scarf on your cock like that?  God damn.  Dick will look like that Vietnamese girl getting napalm running down the street.  Are you ready?  Oh, yeah, I'm done with that one.  All right.  How can you get an adrenaline boost that'll wake you up for sex?  I got a stable three times.  Give it a shot. 
[03:31:30]  Watch a scary movie.  Uh-huh.  Drink coffee.  Do kangle exercises.  That is?  Mm-hmm.  An adrenaline boost.  Mm-hmm.  I'm going to say watch a scary movie.  So you watch a scary movie, and then you want to fuck.  My girlfriend and I were watching The Exorcist yesterday.  Mm-hmm.  And she's a scaredy cat.  Yeah.  And we're watching it, and it's like really getting scary, like when fucking Meryn shows  up at the house.  Yeah, pretty creepy.  And she's fucking grabbing my hand, going, touch my ass.  And she's trying to put my hand on her puss.  Really? 
[03:32:00]  Yeah.  And I'm like, no.  Watch this scary movie.  She was just trying to distract from her terror.  That's all I was.  I like when little 12-year-old Reagan comes out and pisses on the carpet.  How do you not love that?  That makes me shoot my load right there.  She's going to die up there.  That's all I was.  That's all I was.  That's all I was.  That's all I was.  Hole in one.  What could this one be?  I'm going to open this up.  Which of the following is true about kissing?  A, it can relieve headaches.  B, it reduces plaque. 
[03:32:30]  It helps unclog pores.  This game fucking stinks.  Guess what you want your partner to do?  Lick the food off your teeth.  Reduces plaque.  Sometimes I'll ask my girlfriend to lift her gums up.  I'll just snake my tongue under her gums and lick her perientitis.  Look at the ingredients for this one.  A short skirt. 
[03:33:00]  One miniature golf course.  Wow.  Oh, boy.  What is it?  How to seduce that Moxley girl?  Take him out in an especially arousing game of miniature golf.  Have to pay for the game and collect your equipment.  Excuse yourself for trips to the ladies' room.  When you come back, hand him the golf ball.  Hand him a golf ball wrapped in your panties.  I think I came up with a way to make the game a little more interesting, honey. 
[03:33:30]  Take your turn first.  You practice with the same skirt in front of a mirror so you know exactly how to bend  and place your ball to give him the best view.  When it's his turn, stroll over to the hole while he sets up his shot  and crouch down behind it with your knees just slightly apart.  Tease him all across the course with one little flash after another.  How much should you expose?  Let me put it this way.  If he doesn't send a ball flying out into the parking lot, you're not showing him enough.  Or express surprise when a gopher hides in your pussy. 
[03:34:00]  Try to queef real hard and get the windmill spinning.  What if there's other people in this fucking place?  Children go to miniature golf.  And you notice him winding up and hitting the ball really hard,  trying to mash it into your box.  Daddy, I just got a hole-in-one in hole seven, 
[03:34:30]  and my ball smells like trout.  That is ridiculous.  Someone spilled clam chowder on my ball.  Daddy, the hole on hole number seven isn't round.  It's shaped like a toothless mouth.  Nightypuss, spring break, twice the spice, stroke of genius. 
[03:35:00]  Let's see that.  What?  I've got to open up this one.  All I'm thinking.  What's it called?  It's called stroke of genius, Jim.  Ah, what could it possibly be?  I don't know. 
[03:35:30]  Ingredients.  Dip clark.  A lot of salt.  And Dr. Cuckoo.  Cuckoo.  Dr. Cuckoo.  And a lot of salt.  Dr. Cuckoo.  Dr. Cuckoo.  Wouldn't that be ironic?  Oh, I'm in a very silly mood.  Yes.  When people follow a superstition and honk their horns at a newly married couple, 
[03:36:00]  it ensures a long marriage, many children, or great sex.  Or D, an ugly limo ride in Long Island.  Oh, my God.  D, you're going down the wrong way on the parkway.  And mommy will soon be well.  No.  See, great sex.  Great sex.  I would never say that.  It's horrible. 
[03:36:30]  That's terrible.  I'm sorry.  How'd your parents die?  Okay.  Got any more over there, Ant?  Here you go.  Here's some more cards.  Oh, yeah.  I got a few over here.  What's the spice?  Guy world.  What could guy world be?  Men's, um...  They don't open well.  They're not perforated. 
[03:37:00]  These aren't perforated properly.  What's that gentleman with the camera?  Leading question.  In the female superior position,  what can a woman do to burn more calories?  This fan said vomit.  A female superior?  Is that her on top, I would assume?  Squat and bounce while you're having sex.  Yeah, bounce up and down to burn more calories.  Not just sit there.  What the fuck does she want?  Right.  Two hot adult DVDs, 
[03:37:30]  one hot pizza,  one cold six-pack.  Welcome to guy world.  Gather all the ingredients  for a male fantasy paradise.  Beer, pizza, and porn.  You won't be alone.  40% of X-rated video customers are women.  Dress sexy,  but not in the Victoria's Secret way.  Instead, put on the guy world  hottie classic,  a white t-shirt,  and cut-offs.  That's not...  I know.  Think Daisy Duke goes to Hooters.  Make him comfortable.  Feed him.  Watch some TV burnt,  but turn up the heat. 
[03:38:00]  Kiss him after each bite.  Ew.  That's good.  That shitty dry pizza breath you get  for the lactose.  Make out during commercials.  After dinner,  unveil your special surprise.  A couple of DVDs full of hot,  serious X-rated sex.  Get bolder as the video gets wilder.  Play with yourself while he watches.  Duplicate the on-screen action.  Tonight,  you are the hottest thing  in all of guy world.  Tonight,  he'll be the horse.  His own personal porn star 
[03:38:30]  with an insatiable appetite  and a bottle of lubricant.  Of course,  back in girl world,  you might be walking funny  the next day.  Ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba.  Because he chopped your legs off  when you were done.  It's just so stupid  that they don't understand,  like, you know,  give him beer and pizza  and then try to seduce him  when he's in a blackout  and shitting.  Hey, this brings us around  to the beginning of the show.  Oh, that was called  the Mrs. McCartney  because you're walking funny  the next day.  This brings us back  to the beginning of the show  for a real thrill. 
[03:39:00]  How do you directly stimulate  a man's prostate gland?  I think everyone knows this  but doesn't want.  You stick a finger up his ass.  Is it A, finger?  B, toe?  Toe.  See, a penis ring.  If you stick a toe,  if any girl ever tried  to stick a toe on my ass,  seriously,  I don't mean just  playing around in bed.  Well, you threw out  that fucking amendment  to the proposition 
[03:39:30]  to the Constitution.  You put out that little  asterisk quickly.  Kidding, of course.  You ever, you ever,  like, jab at your loved one  with your foot, though?  You know?  You kind of get in  the crack of their ass  and wiggle your toes.  And they go,  woo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo.  Wee!  That's always fun.  Well, yeah, it's a finger.  Is it safe to try  to get out of bed  at your place?  Is it like one of the  same things when you go,  oh, I gotta, you know,  get out of bed  to go, you go downstairs 
[03:40:00]  to get something  or you take a leak  or something?  What are you getting at?  You just play  the grab the ass game  or finger in the crack game.  It's hysterical.  You get up  and then it's like,  woo!  funny  alright I'm looking for more questions  what do you need here  one kitty groomed in wax  and lots of confidence  some in like legs 
[03:40:30]  some go for breasts  some are all about the butt  but a guy  but every guy is turned on by confidence  what  and there's nothing hotter than a woman  with the kind of sexual self-assurance  that you're about to display  grab his collar  plant a kiss on his lips  and whisper your instructions  get naked and get in bed  right now  dim the lights  and put on the kind of music  that makes you dance  shove him onto his back  and straddle him  wiggle your way up past his chest  and shoulders  grab the headboard 
[03:41:00]  and keep that pretty little puss  hovering over his face  dancing all the while  it's a lap dance  but a hundred times better  because it's a lap dance  on his tongue  he sure ain't gonna be getting that  from anywhere else  yeah  Jesus  tease him for as long as you can  hold out without letting him taste you  oh so you hover over there  and be a real fucking cunt about it  after he has enjoyed the view for a minute  the view  what is it  there's burrows walking there  working their way down 
[03:41:30]  after he's enjoyed the view for a minute  it's time to let him know  make him please you with his tongue  and don't be shy  let him know how much you enjoy his skills  every moan and gasp  means he's doing it right  you might even say  perfect  get it the puss  pussy  this isn't good enough  to even throw in the garbage  oh  right before your period  hover over his face  drop a maraschino cherry on his chin
