<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast began with a deep dive into their controversial "Whip Em Out Wednesday" (WOW) segment.  The hosts, Opie and Anthony, recounted the segment's history, highlighting past successes (including numerous instances of women flashing their breasts on live television news broadcasts) and the resulting backlash from women's groups and negative press, specifically citing an article by Eileen McNamara in the Boston Globe.  They detailed conflicts with station management, naming Dave Douglas and Dave Dickless as those who tried to suppress WOW. Listener calls shared both triumphant and disappointing WOW experiences.  A studio guest, Mary, reported from a WOW sticker distribution event. A letter from Vanilla Ice's people to "Stinky," a recurring character, was also mentioned. The segment concluded with plans to continue promoting WOW and provided an address for sticker requests.  The entire segment was punctuated by considerable crude and offensive language.

The show then transitioned to the case of Susie Greenberg, a listener who flashed her breasts on the Today Show in support of WOW.  The hosts replayed news clips covering the incident, including Greenberg's appearance on Extra, and compared it to other instances of public nudity on television. Opie commented negatively on Greenberg's breasts. A phone call with Doug, a former colleague from a Boston news station, revealed unseen, more explicit footage from a past Opie and Anthony news segment, leading to a discussion about news media sensationalism and editing.

The conversation veered off to Opie’s recent move and his sparsely furnished, squalid living conditions, prompting a discussion on acquiring furniture, especially in younger years. This segued into a disastrous dinner with Jim Norton, Ross, and Ben, focusing on Norton's extreme overreaction to a minor restaurant incident involving a bug and missing bread, culminating in threats to the waitress.  "Psycho Tim," involved in the incident, later called in to explain his actions.  The segment ended with further promotion of WOW stickers and a lengthy discussion about the complexities of splitting restaurant bills, particularly when someone orders expensive alcohol.

Next, Adam Farrar called in to promote his show "The Job" on ABC. This was followed by a discussion of "Sweet Release," a sexual enhancement supplement, before the arrival of The Amazing Kreskin. Kreskin attempted a magic trick involving a voodoo doll representing Osama bin Laden, a drawing, and a deck of cards, culminating in a seemingly accidental fall. The trick, explained as a complex card trick involving audience participation, led to much confusion, banter, and physical comedy. Jim Norton's off-air behavior was also discussed, highlighting his contrasting on- and off-air personalities.  The segment concluded with further discussion of Kreskin’s trick and a brief mention of Ozzy Osbourne.

The broadcast then featured a Wesley Willis song about the O.J. Simpson trial, followed by a discussion about a radio morning show host, Scott Pharrell, who had reportedly suffered a mental breakdown. A "Whip It Out Wednesday" call from Lindsey in Cleveland highlighted a misunderstanding of radio delay. The show took an unexpected turn with the in-studio appearance of Ozzy Osbourne and Andrew Dice Clay, along with Sharon Osbourne (mostly off-mic).  The conversation became chaotic, featuring profanity, crude humor, insults, and discussions of various body parts, as Ozzy recounted a story about chasing a cat and Dice frequently interrupted.  Dice discussed his upcoming performances and plans for incorporating bubbles and confetti. The segment abruptly ended with Ozzy's departure.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  Call me shallow, but ain't that the truth.  Ah.  Welcome to the O.P. and Anthony Show.  It's Whip Em Out Wednesday.  Season on!  Yes, season on. Game on.  Game on!  Here it is.  We've been waiting for that damn Daylight Savings Time thing.  That has finally happened, so now we can fully promote Whip Em Out Wednesday once again, Anthony.  That's because it's a light out now.  Well, if you take this show and tape delay and run it at night, sucks to be you. 
[00:00:30]  You don't even know what you're missing.  And, you know, the nice weather, the Daylight Savings, Wednesday, boobs.  I'm addicted to boobies!  Put that wow on the vehicle.  That's what you gotta do.  Dude, the phones are already, like, going nuts.  Wow.  The phones are opposite.  Wow.  That's supposed to be over there and that over there.  Ah.  Oh, yeah.  Okay.  Mike from Philly, what's going on? 
[00:01:00]  Yo, O&A, you guys rock, first of all.  All right, cool.  What do you got today?  Hey, dude.  Wow works.  Duh.  Duh.  Duh.  It's for Jesus.  Yes, yes.  I'm a UPS driver.  I got a wow sign in the front of my truck.  Yep.  Four times this year so far.  You're doing better than most people.  Yeah, a lot of people just wish to get that one.  Yes.  I've seen everything from the petite little eggs.  I had a big fat slob. 
[00:01:30]  Wow me.  And now even the big fat slob.  Isn't that cool?  Dude.  Hey.  What can I say?  Breath to breath, man.  Right.  Well, save some boobies for others, okay?  You know what?  I can.  I gotta take them all.  All right.  Thank you.  I'm in it.  Thank you.  We're going to Lisa in Philly.  Lisa, what's going on?  Hi.  I'm wowing right now.  Look at that, Anthony.  You are.  Where are you?  Yes, I am.  Now, where are you wowing in Philly?  I am on 76.  All right.  Yep.  I'm heading down, actually, to the city right now. 
[00:02:00]  All right.  And you're just flipping your top up and showing those.  Yeah, I am a first-time wower.  And how good does it feel, Lisa?  It's freeing.  Freeing, okay.  It's very freeing.  That's what we're doing here, freeing.  And, Lisa, how big are you?  I am a D.  Nice.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  And I have just turned legal as well.  Nice.  Nice.  I feel D cup.  Teen wow.  Teen wowing in Philly.  Teen wow. 
[00:02:30]  I am not a teen.  I am 21.  Oh, all right.  Let's just say teen wow.  Almost teen wowing.  I thought she said when she was legal, 18, because 18 is fun.  I hear what she's saying.  Hey, Lisa, do us one favor, though.  Yes.  Don't show anyone those luscious cans unless they have a wow in their car.  Right.  Some girls get carried away.  It's the only rule of wowing.  Oh, give it away for free, Lisa.  No.  I've seen a few of them.  So, you know, I only went out to his special people. 
[00:03:00]  All right.  Thank you.  That's what we...  No problem.  That's what we asked.  All right.  Thank you.  Awesome Garrett rocks.  You guys rock.  All right.  Thank you.  Awesome Garrett.  Awesome Garrett rocks.  Awesome Garrett wasn't too awesome yesterday, though.  He was very mad at the lactating woman.  But in an awesome way.  But I guess it made him a little awesome.  Wasn't it awesome when he came in, though, and got mad?  And we were expecting him to say awesome, and instead he said, I hate her?  I thought his response was awesome.  Did you see the letter he got from Vanilla Ice's people? 
[00:03:30]  Yeah.  Vanilla Ice likes the stink monster.  I was laughing.  He goes, look what I got.  Look at the letter I got from Vanilla Ice's people.  I couldn't believe it.  And a high.  And I open it up and look, and there's a picture of Vanilla Ice and Stinky from the show.  I guess they were taking pictures as people.  And they got that picture, and Vanilla Ice autographed it to Stinky and sent it to Stinky.  And it says to Stinky.  This is pre-Awesome Garrett days, you know. 
[00:04:00]  Right.  So, uh, he was just like, could you believe what a loser?  It was like, come on.  I mean, I signed the wall of Club Awesome.  That's classic.  Club Awesome now.  Let me go to...  Under new management.  Let me go to...  I guess I'm Awesome Garrett now, new manager of Club Awesome.  Club Awesome.  You ever see when the same guy opens up a club with a different name, because maybe it was  a biker bar before that, or strip club or something, they want to change, like, motifs? 
[00:04:30]  Yeah.  And the next thing you know, he puts a sombrero on, and it's a Tex-Mex type place.  It's Tex-Mex.  Right.  Les Stinkies.  Les Stinkies.  Stinky Bandido.  It's a French stairwell now.  Les Stinkies.  La Fiesta de la Awesome-o.  Is your picture of you and, um, of N.L.I.S. cool, or what?  I'm waiting to get a nice frame for it.  Yeah, I'm sure you're waiting.  Oh, I totally am. 
[00:05:00]  Are you going to put it on your desk?  It's classic.  Are you going to put it on your desk?  N.L.I.S. had the time to sign a picture and send it to me.  You know what's funny about the whole thing?  He signs things real easy when you dangle them out a window.  Watch behind the music to catch up.  Okay.  You know what's funny about that whole picture thing that Awesome-o.  Gary was telling us in the back office?  I think he kind of said it.  You never asked for an autograph?  No.  He just assumed that you needed an autograph from Vanilla Ice.  Right. 
[00:05:30]  I really did.  The picture wasn't good enough that he was sending you.  It was nice of him that he sent a picture.  But he felt, not only do I need to send Awesome-o, Gary a picture, I'm going to sign it Vanilla Ice.  I'm signing it just to show him that he was a little special that day.  With a letter of appreciation.  With a letter of appreciation by his people, not even by him.  Right.  He enjoyed his time in the stairwell.  We had a great time with Vanilla Ice.  Vanilla Ice enjoyed it.  Who knew?  Is it true that Patrick Swayze is now bouncing at Club's stinky, Club Awesome's Roadhouse?  Right behind the Velvet Lose. 
[00:06:00]  It is.  I hear they're expanding up and down, if you know what I mean.  Oh, is it now a whole other level?  I think it's a three-level club now.  I don't know.  I think you might infringe on club accounting firm that might not want you on their level, if you know what I mean.  I walked out of the back office yesterday, right by the bathroom, where the little old man usually lurched.  I smell something that smells like hemp.  I mean, literally, from 80 feet down the hall, I could smell it. 
[00:06:30]  It was great.  Big night of Club's stinky.  There you go.  All right, let's go to Wilbur.  Checking in in New Hampshire, Anthony.  Wilbur, what's up?  Hey, I just wanted to thank you guys.  Huh?  Yes.  I've been driving trucks for two years.  Never seen movies in my life driving.  Yeah.  Saw them today.  You saw them today.  You got the one on the rig, right?  I got a wow on the back of my rig, and I saw them today.  Four girls out on the Everett Turnpike.  There you go.  I'm telling you, we're going to get thousands of winners every week with this wow thing. 
[00:07:00]  It's the greatest radio promotion ever invented.  I love you guys.  A promotion that Dave Dickless didn't understand when we were up in Boston and made us stop.  Made us stop wow.  Hey, guys.  Hi.  Dave Douglas.  I'm just thinking the wow thing.  You know, we're getting a lot of flack from it.  The police department, women's groups, and you know how I buckle under to everything? 
[00:07:30]  I'm doing it now, guys.  Stop doing the wow.  Stop doing the wow.  No, I'm asking nice this time, but if you don't listen, my head's going to blow up red,  my veins are going to pop through my head, and I'm going to yell and yell right up until  the point where you start laughing hysterically at me.  Remember that?  The pussy didn't allow us to do wow.  Because?  Wow started about seven years ago now.  Yeah.  Letters.  Lamont and Tonelli. 
[00:08:00]  Douchebags.  You're not fooling anyone out there on the West Coast.  Who are they?  I have a morning show out of, I don't know, San Jose, somewhere out there, that basically  took wow and make them believe it's theirs.  Yeah.  You know when the girl wowed on the Today Show?  Yeah.  They took credit for that.  Oh, yeah, there's one of our listeners wowing in front of us.  No, they didn't.  Yeah.  Swear to you.  Yeah.  It's kind of sad.  Even though the chick came from our show, came on after she did it to say it, went on  a, a, a, a, a, a, what's that program with, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, 
[00:08:30]  was it extra?  Went on extra admitting that she did it for us, but then they're out there, you know,  claiming, I don't know, man, this is our idea.  It's quite sad.  It's quite sad.  Anyway, go ahead, Anthony.  You know, we get a couple of letters every season that we start this back up again.  National Organization of Women.  Yeah.  They don't like wow.  It looks too much like now on the back of the cars.  It's like, oh, women's group.  What was that?  Women of the World?  Women of the World. 
[00:09:00]  Wow.  Women of the World.  They hold these yearly seminars on women empowerment and stuff.  You might have there.  Wow.  You might have there.  Change your logo.  The state.  Carpet munchers.  Carpet munchers.  The Massachusetts State Police used to issue every Wednesday, every Wednesday, they'd issue  a little standing order about how to handle wow and radio promotion.  And they sent letters off to Dave Dickless, Dave Spineless. 
[00:09:30]  And Dave came to us and said, it was after I think an article came out in the Globe.  Yeah.  Remember that?  By Eileen McNamara.  Oh, you remember that?  Dude, I remember all our enemies.  Yes.  I'm obsessive that way.  Yes.  The enemy list is growing by leaps and bounds.  It certainly has.  An article came out.  Don Belucas.  Douchebag.  Yeah.  Mr. Fire Us guy.  An article came out in the Globe about Whip Him Out Wednesday by this Eileen woman.  And she didn't like it at all. 
[00:10:00]  Ooh.  Degrading to women.  Horrible thing that's going to just cause the end of the world as we know it.  I got the article.  Do you?  I can bring it in for next Wednesday.  Yeah, we should do that.  Because it was pretty funny.  And Dickless.  What else did the whole say?  Well, the slit didn't have one valid point.  It was all ridiculous.  But.  Ridiculous.  But Dave Dickless.  I just love the way he says that word.  Dave Dickless just buckled under. 
[00:10:30]  Just, ugh.  Stop wow.  And, you know, we were two ass wipes on the radio.  Just hoping to claw, you know, some existence out of our show at that point.  We hadn't been together very long.  Well, we were, how it went down, we were suspended.  A real suspension rocked up.  Yeah, like my suspension that's going to last all week till I come back and blow out those tickets I stole from Dave.  So they suspend us and then pretty much tell us, if you don't stop wow, you will be fired.  Yeah.  We didn't really have many options at the time and figured it was, you know, we had a buckle under. 
[00:11:00]  Because, you know, we had a lot of listeners that supported us.  We did read the memo on the air.  Read the memo, got suspended, almost fired.  And wow never stopped.  And they, yeah, it never stopped really, but they took it away from us.  And now it's like the hugest thing in America.  Yeah, way to have insight, Dave.  Way to have insight, Dave Douglas from WAF.  I just don't, um, I don't see it going anywhere.  What, Dave?  Your wife didn't like wow?  Well, that's what it was.  We all know she runs the radio station. 
[00:11:30]  Hi, Poopsie.  Keep it as PC as possible, even though you act like you're all cool up there.  Ooh.  What's up?  What's up, Poopsie?  I don't like that, um, wow thing that Opie and Anthony do.  I'll eliminate it right away, schnookums.  That's okay.  Did you put the house up for sale yet?  So seven years later, it's this huge phenomenon.  Huge!  Now in 18 cities.  So, uh, this, this, uh, what was her name from the globe?  Eileen McNamara.  Uh, what else did this, uh, life support system for a meat pocket say? 
[00:12:00]  I'll bring the article in.  I'll bring it in tomorrow.  I'll find it.  Yeah.  All right?  So, uh, wow is here, Anthony.  Yes.  Wow.  Let me just...  There's no stopping it.  There was no stopping it then.  It took on a life of its own.  People just enjoyed doing this.  The women loved doing it.  And the men, of course, they loved seeing it.  Let me go to Sticker Face.  Sticker Face!  Yo, what's up, guys?  Hey, what's going on?  Not much.  I'm here at BCN in Boston, and I am covered in wow, and I'm ready to go out there and promote. 
[00:12:30]  Yeah, you might want to uncover your mouth.  It sounds like he's got the stickers all over his face.  It sounds like a little mask.  Is that better, guys?  Yeah.  Okay.  You sound like Terry Anderson in 1986.  I hear every...  I hear every...  I don't like Terry...  Oh, thank you.  I hear every Wednesday outside WBCN, I believe it's 1265 Boylston Street.  That's the one.  You know, the guys hang out with their wow signs and stuff, so if the ladies are in the  area, take care of the guys outside WBCN. 
[00:13:00]  Yeah, let's get some people down here to join the festivities.  All right, man.  Thank you.  You guys rock.  All right.  Bye.  We're very excited that wow season is finally upon us.  This thing takes on a life of its own.  It really...  Watch how this thing builds.  Oh, yeah.  Now that we'll be spending a little more time on this.  Like today, you'll see some stickers out there, and some girls will be wowing a little bit,  and, you know, we'll get some calls from guys very excited.  As the weeks go on, you will not be able to drive around your city without seeing at least  one wow sign, whether it's a bumper sticker or a homemade wow sign. 
[00:13:30]  Yep.  You're going to start noticing when you go to your concerts in your city that pretty  much every other car is going to have wow, and it's going to be so festive it's going  to be ridiculous.  Girls just hanging out of cars wowing like crazy.  You know the big line of traffic to go up to the venue when you're going to a big show?  That whole line of cars.  It's just wows and chicks booms.  You get in the parking lot.  You're hanging outside, you know, trying to hide the beers from the security guys. 
[00:14:00]  Just wows.  You put a huge wow on your trunk while it's open, and you're drinking beers out of there.  The girl's just coming up showing cans.  Yeah.  It's a beautiful, beautiful game.  You're going to see construction sites with, I don't know, 20 to 30 foot wows.  Yep.  I mean, it gets ridiculous, this promotion.  You're going to start seeing wow on your local TV.  Oh, this is something we love.  You're going to see wowing on live TV.  Happens all the time.  We encourage, and we reward. 
[00:14:30]  We do reward.  Wow sightings on live shots of the news.  You know, there's a little story in your town.  They get the local news guy down there to do a live stand-up shot from outside the store  where something's going on.  Maybe there's a big jackpot lotto, and they got the guy asking people,  what are you going to do if you win?  And you might show up behind him with a wow and distract him a little bit.  Let's not forget about Gorilla Man who did that very thing. 
[00:15:00]  Right.  When the local news here in New York did a huge story about some nuclear power plant  where the whole community was in a panic because they thought there was some leakage.  Yeah.  And the guy's doing a very serious report, and he kind of had to stop his report  because a guy in a gorilla suit just lost his effing mind behind the scenes  and started running toward the camera with the wow right in front of the reporter's face.  Let me tell you something.  It is the funniest goddamn thing when you're just sitting home watching the news,  maybe you're channel serving, you just stop by the news,  and you can't believe it when you see it. 
[00:15:30]  There's the wow, and you're like, oh, okay, O&A, the wow.  He's in a gorilla suit.  Dude, we terrorize the local news station so bad in New York.  Within another month, they will start doing their reports.  Call me if I'm wrong on this.  They did it last time.  From the top of their satellite trucks.  Yeah, they stand on the top.  Because they can't be strict level because they don't know when the next wow is going to appear on live TV.  Opie, what do you believe my favorite was?  My favorite wowing episode.  I know which one is your favorite, but I was going to talk about the Gumby guy. 
[00:16:00]  Tyr was pretty funny.  Oh, the guy in the Gumby suit.  The guy in the Gumby suit.  I guess that was a story about some molar station outside a church, I believe.  It was a horrid, horrid story.  Where the guy is standing there going, we're here getting details on this horrific story of abuse.  Here comes Gumby.  Gumby.  Running up behind him with his big wow sign.  Jumping up and down like a lunatic with his wow sign.  They always yell something.  Oh, hey, Rob.  Right.  Or something. 
[00:16:30]  Yeah, that's my favorite.  Oh, yeah.  Well, we all know.  The favorite wow on live TV story goes to, wasn't Psycho Mark part of that one?  Yeah.  And a few of our listeners, it was a group effort.  Maury.  Maury Alter.  Maury Alter, thank you.  Maury Alter doing a stand-up in front of David Letterman's studio.  Yeah, I've got to explain who Maury Alter is.  He's been in this town since I was a baby.  800 years.  He's got to be, seriously, well into his 60s, still reporting, right? 
[00:17:00]  Yeah, am I still a street reporter?  All right, so he's outside the Letterman's studio, which is only, I don't know, three blocks from where we're at right now.  And he's doing a story whether Letterman was going to re-sign with CBS or not.  Or was it the heart?  It was the heart.  Oh, it was his heart operation.  Okay, it was the first day I think he was coming back after heart surgery or something like that.  Right.  And he's on an icy sidewalk.  Next thing you know, you're watching TV and there's Maury doing his stand-up, you know, his stand-up report outside Letterman. 
[00:17:30]  And you see three lunatics running up from behind.  Right.  Now, the lunatics have the huge, huge wow sign.  Because I think that was one of the wow matters or something.  Uh-huh.  And they didn't calculate the ice on the sidewalk.  They stopped short, but their momentum kept going.  And it was like an ice rink.  They slid into Maury live on TV and pretty much knocked him down.  Classic.  Knocked him down. 
[00:18:00]  Now they have control of the live shot.  It was just one of those things that happened, by the way.  Yeah.  Now they have control of the live shot.  The camera guy doesn't know what to do.  And there's the psycho mark and the rest of them just, with their wow sign, having a, you know, running amok.  Running amok.  Everyone's sliding on the ice.  Right.  Next thing you...  No one can get traction.  They're falling.  Next thing you see is guys come running out of the live truck.  Now there's a fight going on on live TV as they're trying to get the wow banner away. 
[00:18:30]  Tell me I'm exaggerating here.  As they try to get the wow banner away from psycho mark, they're having like a tug of war.  And now the camera guy directs his attention to the fight that's going on.  Yeah.  Now Maury, at this point, got up off the ground and starts screaming, no, over here.  Over to me.  Over to me.  Over to me.  Over to me.  So they go back to Maury, who was all disheveled.  He had snow in his hair.  But as a true professional, he was able to finish his live shot. 
[00:19:00]  Yes.  In the background, you see psycho mark and these two listeners running off into the distance.  With thugs, Jason.  With two guys that work for the station running after him.  Right.  My favorite.  Hilarious.  And then they go back to the studio.  And then, you know, the two newsreaders.  I mean, let's be honest.  They're just readers.  Right.  You know how to, like, make believe nothing was going on.  So all this crap is back.  And you just watch what happens with WOW as the weeks build here. 
[00:19:30]  Oh, yeah.  Well, we're excited.  It's here.  I mean, to get involved right away, get the goddamn WOW sign on your car.  That's all you got to do.  Because the girls have been instructed.  They do not flash if they're a fan of this show unless they see a WOW.  Right.  Whether it's a WOW bumper sticker or we love the homemade WOW sign.  Yeah, anything.  It's the easiest thing to do.  It does work.  And like I said in the past, you'll be so surprised and happy when it happens to you.  Because you're not expecting.  Because it's so easy to get involved in. 
[00:20:00]  You just got to put a WOW somewhere on your vehicle.  Big, small, doesn't matter.  Just get a WOW on your vehicle and you're in.  Game on.  Game on.  And then before you know it, you're just driving around.  You're stuck in traffic.  You're cruising down the highway.  Whatever it is, you look over and think to yourself, why the hell is this girl showing  me those luscious, luscious breasts?  If I may use your paintbrush to paint an artistic picture of beautiful boobs, Opie.  And you'll be so shocked and surprised and go, oh, it was the WOW.  And a note to the ladies, WOW is not for just Wednesdays anymore. 
[00:20:30]  Oh, no.  It pretty much means, you know, whip them out whenever.  But we focus on Wednesdays.  Right.  Okay?  And the one thing we've asked the guys, and this works great every year,  you know, there are plenty of women out there that will do this on their own.  They want to do it.  We just had a couple girls, or one girl on that said it's a freeing experience.  I love doing this.  Blah, blah, blah.  But do not harass ladies.  Do not follow the ladies.  That's not what this is about at all.  Right.  There are plenty of ladies that will do it because they want to do it.  All right? 
[00:21:00]  And our listeners, if you're a listener to this show and you're really into the show,  you'll respect that, you know, because we need that.  I'm distracted because there's a girl calling in that's WOWing Anthony.  Oh, her name is Davida.  Davida is WOWing.  Davida.  What's up, guys?  It's Whipple now Wednesday.  Hey, Davida.  How you doing?  In honor of Whipple now Wednesday, I'll be on the expressway showing my fun bag. 
[00:21:30]  All right.  If you're not so outside, I might show the yam bag and the mule, too.  So Whipple now, I'll be there.  All right.  Thank you, Davida.  Bye.  Thank you, Davida.  Did he break out a character at the end of that, though?  I mean, he might have.  I heard him.  I heard him.  Later.  Andrew.  Hey, Opie and Anthony.  What's up?  Uh, pleasure for me.  How about the first, uh...  Pleasure for me.  The first local station to have, like, a negative WOW report.  Oh, yeah.  Every year they'll, uh...  Every year they do a story on WOW for us. 
[00:22:00]  Mm-hmm.  Free publicity for the show.  Thank you.  Right.  All right.  Thanks, bro.  See you.  Bye.  All right.  We should, uh, break, I guess.  And we'll...  What?  What?  Jim, what are you doing?  What are you doing?  What's the matter, Jimmy?  I'm in a very good mood.  Nothing else.  Are you good?  Are there going to be any temper tantrums outside the door during our commercials?  No.  Any phone calls and then a big kick of a garbage pail and an F these mother effers? 
[00:22:30]  Absolutely not.  No?  You're happy today.  Oh, that's what I want to do.  Whip them out Wednesday and I'm very pleased.  All right.  And every, uh...  Very good.  Every Wednesday here in New York, we're sending out our WOW van to a location so we can hand out  as many bumper stickers as possible.  And, uh, a lot of the stations we're on in other cities are doing the same thing.  So you just keep listening to the show for details.  But right now, let's talk to Mary.  Mary!  Hey, what's going on, guys?  It's, uh, it's Opera Mary.  Ha, ha, ha, ha.  And you're in the WOW van.  Where are you guys today? 
[00:23:00]  The van is at Route 22 West in Union, Jersey, right in front of the Wiz.  Right in front of the Wiz.  Okay.  It's really beautiful out here, and every time a truck drives by, they honk their horn  at us, and there's WOW stickers all over it.  So it's a good thing.  All right, cool.  But, uh, you guys are going to be there a while, uh, handing out the Opie and Anthony  WOW stickers, right?  We will be giving out stickers for at least an hour and a half.  So everybody should stop there and get one.  All right.  Route 22, Union, New Jersey, right outside the Wiz.  Thank you, Mary.  You're welcome, dude.  Later.  All right.  Peace. 
[00:23:30]  A couple phone numbers in the New York area.  877-692-1027.  Anywhere else outside of New York, you can use, uh, 866-277-4WOW.  With a loud Wednesday.  Oh, man.  One big door.  Wow, wow, wow, wow, wow, wow, wow, wow, wow, wow, wow.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  Mm, I love that.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  1027-W-W-W-W.  We're artists. 
[00:24:00]  Oh, my God.  Wow.  Yeah, we're back with the Opie and Anthony Show.  Take it off.  Whip them out Wednesday today.  The season's finally upon us.  And we couldn't be more excited about it, Anthony. 
[00:24:30]  You know, spring is definitely in the air and summer right around the corner when WOW makes its debut.  It's always happening, but, you know, we downplayed it for the last six months, but it's back because it's cold and dark, and it's very hard to WOW during the show hours when it's dark out and cold.  But now, you'll see, time will go by, the convertible tops are down, there's girls just flashing, guys with WOW in their vehicles.  To our new listeners, even the new ones in New York, getting new listeners every day, and losing listeners every day, even in New York. 
[00:25:00]  You know, just to get involved with WOW, you just got to get a WOW in your car and watch.  This thing will take on a life of its own.  Yeah.  Simple concept, you put a WOW bumper sticker or a homemade WOW in your car, and the ladies, if they feel like it, will show you their boobs on the way home from wherever you're coming from.  Works like a charm every single Wednesday.  Yeah, it works, and it really helps out in traffic. 
[00:25:30]  I think it eliminates road rage.  You're stuck in traffic, and you see that?  You're not thinking about what time you got to get somewhere and the car in front of you not moving.  You don't care.  And watch how WOW grows week after week after week.  It'll get insane, and then you'll start noticing the WOW on live TV, like we were discussing, and big, huge WOW displays in your city.  It's going to get ridiculous, I promise.  Well, Opie, we found the Boston Globe article.  We found the article. 
[00:26:00]  This is great.  I forgot how funny this was.  It's dated WOW.  This goes back a ways.  It's June of 97.  June of 97.  June of 97.  I believe this was the second year of WOW, so...  Yeah, we'd already been building it.  So I was off a year.  Yeah.  We'd been doing it for, like, this is our sixth year.  Yeah.  Go ahead.  Well, it starts, like WOW?  No, not a bit.  That's the headline by Eileen McNamara from the Boston Globe. 
[00:26:30]  Eileen McNamara.  She goes, remember Wednesday, when Wednesday was Prince Spaghetti Day?  Remember how nice and harmless that was, Opie?  Well, it's 1997.  In Lowell, the financially troubled Prince Pasta Factory is up for sale.  In Worcester, Wednesdays are even more trouble than that at WAAF Radio, where we used to work.  Opie, remember the old days?  Yeah, yeah, I do.  Ugh.  Midweek now means WOW.  Whip them out Wednesdays.  The station that bills itself as radio that really rocks? 
[00:27:00]  No, it was the show, Opie and Anthony's show.  The station did nothing but try to bury it.  And they did bury it, and we almost got fired for it.  Yeah.  Encourages men to place WOW signs on their car windows, urging women to show them their breasts.  All over eastern and central Massachusetts, boys masquerading as men are spelling out WOW  and masking tape on their car's rear and side windows.  Masquerading as men.  This sophomoric stunt is the brainchild of two witless disc jockeys, Opie and Anthony. 
[00:27:30]  Nice.  Witless.  Who's been the...  Ha ha, witless.  You, witless.  How the hell did we survive so long being witless, Anthony?  This slit has no sense of humor.  I don't know.  You can just tell what she's all about.  Hey, slit, we have wit.  She's batting a thousand so far as far as I'm concerned.  Yeah, you know, she's kind of right.  Yes, witless disc jockeys, Opie and Anthony,  where you spend the evening drive time regaling listeners with memories of such developmental milestones 
[00:28:00]  as their first erections on the school bus.  Hey, that was good radio.  That was fun.  Remember that?  Come on.  That's something people go through.  I didn't even know you drove one.  Oh, come on.  What she's referring to, Anthony, used to get the wood on the school buses.  I got wood.  No apparent reason.  On school buses.  Yeah.  On the school bus.  Like, I guess it was sixth, seventh grade.  I had to take the school bus.  And for some reason, it had nothing to do with any thought that was going through my head,  anything I was looking at. 
[00:28:30]  No vibrations, motions, nothing.  For some mental friggin' reason, I'd sit down on the school bus and, you know, boing.  Yeah.  I'd just get wood.  I just really did it.  I just had the same problem at the Huntington Crescent Club caddying in for 70-year-old ladies.  Oh, true story.  I'm like, what's sicker?  I'm like, what is going...  Look, I acknowledged the fact that it was stupid and there was...  You know, I couldn't understand it.  I'm like, I'm not turned on by this.  Why is it happening now?  Sure.  No, man. 
[00:29:00]  I was just, you know, you're a kid and...  You want the club in my pants?  Hey, there's clear stuff on my 9-iron.  Golly, I'm hot today.  That must be the tea.  Go ahead, Ian.  Their pubescent preoccupation with bodily functions from the bathroom to the bedroom puts them in the mainstream of standard FM radio fare.  This is an era, after all, when Howard Stern claims to be the king of all media and Time magazine cites Don Imus as one of the 25 most influential Americans. 
[00:29:30]  The First Amendment casts a long shadow of necessity.  It protects the lowest common denominator.  And there is much to be said for the argument that women can turn off programs that offend us.  But women should not have to turn off the highway to elude the leering pursuit of morons in the adjacent lane.  Look, she must hate that we're back in Boston. 
[00:30:00]  It's no one leering.  How many people are hating the fact we're back in Boston?  She had no clue.  Oh, I'm sure she loves it.  She had no clue how WOW works.  The guy puts the WOW in the vehicle, and then the woman decides if she's going to flash her breasts.  If you're a woman driving your car, you're not going to have to worry about a guy with a WOW.  You just drive past it.  You don't acknowledge it.  Certainly, even the giant intellects at WAF must know they work at a third-rate station in a second-rate market. 
[00:30:30]  And that not every radio in every car is tuned to their daily diet of Jimi Hendrix and ZZ Top.  I love how AF used to play the worst music.  Remember?  ZZ Top.  Ugh.  ZZ Top.  Sharp-Dressed Man is a great song, though.  Yeah, but not when you're claiming to be the cool station in town.  Bunch of phonies.  One woman thought the letters mistakenly had been inverted and should have read MOM.  Another speculated that the letters stood for WOMEN OF WISDOM. 
[00:31:00]  Cock-eyed optimists both.  Cock-eyed, Opie.  And it figures that the arrogant whole would think that the W had to stand for WOMEN AT ALL.  There's a million words that begin with W.  Why would she think it stood for WOMEN AT ALL?  Right.  Could have stood for WOMEN AT ALL.  Because we can hold everyone, idiot.  Oh.  Whip them out Wednesday.  Women offended by or unaware of the meaning of WOW report being cut off in traffic and nearly driven off the road for failing to comply with the displayed demand.  Eh!  You twat!  You, you, you twat! 
[00:31:30]  She is using the press to mislead the people.  That's what she was doing.  Look, I feel like the article just came out.  I'm getting all mad.  This is like a five-year-old article.  Yeah, it's about five years old.  But, but she, she's using it to her own means.  Well, the press does this all the time.  Okay, if, if she has a report of this, who was the lady and what were the circumstances?  Yeah.  Give me one example.  No one's driving women off the road.  You put the WOW in your car, you wait.  You wait. 
[00:32:00]  And then, uh, women will WOW.  Women that want to.  And then you go on your way.  And that's the way it's been going for years.  Liar.  Lying.  Bitch.  But instead of abandoning their adolescent promotion, Opie and Anthony have spent the  last few days polluting the airwaves with attacks on their female critics.  Hey, we're doing that again.  All very thoughtful, of course, on the order of the caller who boasted that he now placed  a new sign alongside WOW that reads,  Now Sucks, the National Organization of Women. 
[00:32:30]  Well, now it does suck.  It does.  They're telling you ladies how you should think.  Yeah, they're an organization that say women should have the independence to think for themselves,  but they'll do it for you.  Right.  They'll do it for you.  These are women that decide they want to WOW on Wednesday like this, on Whip and Mal Wednesday.  They are doing what they want.  It's fun.  Like one woman said, it's freeing.  It's just a fun thing to get involved in.  And if you don't want to, you don't have to.  And these same holes that are screaming about women being equal, they're the same ones that 
[00:33:00]  will beg for 90% in a divorce settlement.  Of course.  Dishonest holes.  Yeah, what?  Oh, what?  You want equality and stuff?  How come I'm still raping guys over the calls there?  And it's my right to choose.  Hold on real fast.  We'll get back to the article.  Mona.  I got a few questions with WOW.  And then a recent listener for OP and Anthony.  Yes.  You guys rolled.  Norton, you're hot.  Thank you.  You're blind.  My few questions are, number one, I'm really pissed.  I can't find anyone with a WOW sticker. 
[00:33:30]  It will get bigger, right?  It will.  No, it grows.  Trust me.  We have just broken out for the season today.  You watch how this grows from week to week.  But if you saw a WOW out on the highway right now, you would do it, right?  Of course.  And what city are you in?  I live out in like Bumble Tuck.  It sucks.  I hate this place.  I get you guys out of Philly.  And even then, it's like I have to drive to certain areas in order to get you guys.  Well, cool.  If you see WOW, help us out, okay?  And how long does it last for?  It's really whip them out whenever, but we'll spend Wednesdays kind of promoting this  for the next few weeks, so. 
[00:34:00]  All right.  It only lasts like, what, two months, three months?  It lasts all year round, but it's a huge summer thing.  Okay.  Thanks, guys.  Norton, you're awesome.  This is great.  Oh, be quick.  I forgot about this.  We're reading an article that's dated June 21st, 1997.  Right.  This is how pussy Dave Dickless was and how lack of a spine he had about WOW and us and  us actually getting attention for our show.  We've explained to everyone, you know, he turned his back on us after we pulled a mayor prank. 
[00:34:30]  Never talked to us since we pulled that prank.  He runs a radio station where everyone is acting like they're rock stars and cool and on the  edge when they're a bunch of pussies led by the biggest pussy of them all.  Here it is.  June 21st, 1997.  The article we're reading.  Right.  This is from the Globe, June 26th, 1997.  Five days later?  Five days later.  Uh, Opie and Anthony, the two evening drive time personalities on Worcester's AAF were  suspended for two weeks beginning yesterday. 
[00:35:00]  Simultaneously, the station has discontinued their WOW campaign.  WOW or WHIP my Wednesday solicited male motorists to display the letters WRW on the car window  to encourage female motorists to reveal their breasts.  According to WAF Vice President and General Manager Bruce Mittman, the two events are unrelated.  B-b-b-boy.  Brucie, you're lying there, too.  Oh, God.  Unrelated.  Unrelated.  B-b-b-b-boys.  B-b-b-b-b-boys.  You're suspended.  Yeah. 
[00:35:30]  Five days later, we were suspended after this article.  That's what a pussy boy Dave Dickless is.  Folded like a cheap tent.  And speaking.  It was the first publicity we got for the WOW.  Yep.  And, uh, yeah, five days later.  Oh, my God, I can't handle this.  Getting too popular.  Hey, does this toilet scrubber still work for the Boston Globe?  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, does she?  Oh, yeah.  She writes about this crap all the time.  Great.  Maybe she'll write another one.  I've been obsessed with her ever since she wrote this article, and I read her stuff so I could get even more agitated.  You know what it is? 
[00:36:00]  Now, women are stupid, though.  And a lot of you ladies, you really are dummies.  And you need some bright, strong woman to stand up for you and think for you because you can't do it for yourself.  You're making all the wrong decisions for yourself, no matter how much you enjoy doing certain things or thinking things or leading your life.  You just don't know what you're doing.  So you need an organization full of women that are so much smarter than you to tell you what is appropriate.  Yeah.  Let me continue.  And what a coincidence in the next paragraph starts, Dave Dickless is the program manager of WAF. 
[00:36:30]  Dave Douglas.  Yeah, well, some people know his real name, the coward.  He still works there.  Yeah.  Well, we'll see how much longer.  He says, wow began as a lighthearted, fun concept that has grown beyond what we expected.  He acknowledges that the campaign has gotten out of hand and offended some people, but that was not our intent.  Intention, yeah.  Intention.  Sorry.  And says, the road to hell, Mr. Douglas.  Dot, dot, dot.  Dot, dot, dot. 
[00:37:00]  The road to hell, Mr. Douglas.  Dot, dot, dot.  Like little white dots all over her back.  She stinks.  Isn't that awful?  You melodramatic baby maker.  The road to hell, Mr. Douglas.  Dot, dot, dot.  Hair of the dog that feeds you, Mr. Douglas.  You a married man, Mr. Douglas.  He attributes the criticism to the, what, all puritanical nature of this region, 
[00:37:30]  rather than to any debasement of women inherent in the wow concept.  Some women, after all, have chosen to bear their breasts.  He notes, the station is concerned, but will not order Opie and Anthony to stop promoting wow, says Douglas.  What a dick.  Yeah.  Five days later, we're suspended from two weeks.  Five days later, this weaselly worm.  I'm getting worked up like I'm feeling like I still got to work for the schmuck.  Jack hole, dick bag. 
[00:38:00]  Oh, great.  Douglas says, that would infringe on the creative control of the station's two artists.  Really?  He said that about two shock jocks who began their program yesterday,  announcing that once again it was FU Friday.  Something we still do.  We expanded our FU Friday concept to the FU line.  That's hilarious.  See, Rocco?  The FU line.  Came up with it five years ago, you douche-ack-ass.  And he's pretty much admitting here, he says, you know, 
[00:38:30]  that would infringe on the creative control of the station's two artists.  See, told you, we're artists.  See?  We've always known it, Ant.  Yet, they suspended us.  The management of WAF will reduce the visibility of WoW.  But Douglas acknowledges that regardless of what we do,  people will continue to do this.  Yeah.  For another radio station, Dave.  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.  Must piss him off to drive around Massachusetts seeing the WoW everywhere. 
[00:39:00]  Yeah.  Bigger than ever, Dave.  Good choice.  She continues, WAF ought to give some thought to the ages of those people.  One woman reports being shouted at on the Mass Pike by a school bus full of boys no older than 12 holding handmade wow signs.  Another reports seeing two 10-year-olds holding a wow sign on an overpass above I-95.  All these supposed reports.  Rock and roll like adolescence is about rebellion. 
[00:39:30]  That's why Opie and Anthony court parody by calling each other dude on the air as if they were 15-year-old boys.  We don't say dude as much anymore.  Come on.  But the next slide is hilarious.  It just proves that you shouldn't believe everything you read, write, read, see, or here, excuse me.  It says, rock and roll like adolescence is about rebellion.  That's why Opie and Anthony court parody by calling each other dude on the air as if they were 15-year-old boys instead of middle-aged men. 
[00:40:00]  That's great.  This article was written six years ago.  We were not middle-aged men six years ago.  We were actually in our 20s, Anthony.  That's hysterical.  What a douche.  I think I was 13 when we first started working.  I was fresh out of college.  Right.  Fresh-faced kid.  Tussleable hair.  I was still breastfeeding.  Appley-cheeked.  Appley-cheeked.  Standing in a little paper bag.  Crinkle, crinkle.  What annoys me about a big pile of meat built for man pleasure like this lady is that she's trying to tap into that emotion in other fat women that's about, you know, your kids should be protected. 
[00:40:30]  The school bus for 12-year-olds and the 10-year-olds.  Yeah.  And that's why you should stop it because the kids.  And then you read something about the baby bomber in the Palestine who strapped a bomb to himself when he was 10.  Yeah, 10.  I'd rather have him holding wow signs and wanting to see the beautiful form of a woman.  Instead of a submachine gun.  Than strapping a bomb to their body.  Oh, you actually missed my point.  I hate kids.  I like the fact that they did that. 
[00:41:00]  Oh, you like the baby bomber?  Yeah.  You sicko.  Go ahead, Ian.  But rebellion is one thing.  Misogyny is another.  The days of Neanderthals with big clubs are over.  Not if we can't help.  Not if we could help it.  Excuse me.  Marianne Winters, the director of the Massachusetts Coalition Against Sexual Assault, wrote to WAF this week.  Not so, Ms. Winters.  These days, the Neanderthals are calling themselves artists.  And they have creative control.  We're obsessed with that word artist. 
[00:41:30]  Artist.  All right, Da Vinci.  That was my blue period, Anthony.  Yes.  I like to refer to my AF days as the blue period.  The blue.  Would she talk to you on the phone on air?  And address what you have?  She didn't talk to us.  She didn't do nothing.  No.  She got her fake information wherever she could.  Her fake reports of women being run off the road.  Just stop it.  What happened?  And then when the woman went back to her car, there was a giant hook by the door handle. 
[00:42:00]  And her kidneys were missing.  And there was a note that said, get to the hospital.  Your kidneys are being sold on the black market.  And she went to her dog that she got in Mexico.  But it wasn't a dog.  Oh, my God.  It's a giant rat.  And the fans of this show, man, they're maniacs and they yell a lot, but they're not violent.  I've been to enough events with you guys.  It's like you see girls wowing.  And it looks scary because there's a thousand guys screaming.  And that's all they do is cheer like idiots.  And it's done.  Because we love it.  That's all it is.  We love it.  Chrissy, what's up? 
[00:42:30]  Hey.  Hey.  I have a couple things, actually.  All right.  I agree with you on NOW on NOW.  Yeah.  I consider myself a feminist, but I'm not a big fan of the organization.  Okay.  Number two, I'm in Boston.  I talked to you guys yesterday.  I'm trying to find somebody with a WOW sticker.  And me and my friend Jesse are here.  We can't find anybody.  See?  And if you're a guy and you're driving around and you're a fan of the show, you're crazy  not to just put WOW in your car and see what happens.  Right.  As the weeks go on, Chrissy, you'll see more and more.  Trust me on that one.  It's the official kickoff today. 
[00:43:00]  Well, I used to see them when you guys were on AAS.  I used to see them all the time.  Well, this is the first time.  Speaking of which, I wanted to tell you.  My brother stuck a WOW sticker on AAS.  She's not shutting up open.  This is a one-sided conversation.  I'm sorry.  Go ahead.  No, no.  I don't want to say what I wanted to say.  No.  Go ahead.  He's showing you.  Go ahead, Chrissy.  I wanted to tell you my brother stuck a WOW sticker on the AAF truck.  We love when that happens, too.  All right, Chrissy.  Thank you.  And I love Norton.  Thank you, ma'am.  Bye.  Bye.  There you go. 
[00:43:30]  Huh.  I've been hearing a couple of these things.  That's just a coincidence, though, I'm sure.  About the Jay Leno.  Huh.  Did you read that?  Got it from Elmer in Buffalo.  Last night on Jay Leno, there was some comedian on.  Who was it?  I don't know.  After his skit, him and Jay had a little interview thing to make a long story short.  Too late.  The comedian made a comment saying that children should remember breastfeeding after one of  his friends suggested breastfeeding his newborn until he was five years old. 
[00:44:00]  I guess they were talking about breastfeeding children into a late age.  And we had mentioned yesterday when we had a woman breastfeeding a four-year-old that perhaps  you should stop breastfeeding when you get to the point where the child is going to remember  having his mother's milk bag in his mouth.  Louis C.K., I'm going to guess.  It was a little disturbing yesterday when the kid was playing pinball and foosball in between  feedings.  The sickest thing was his little kid indented knuckled hand.  You know, they get the chubby little hands and their knuckles are indented. 
[00:44:30]  Shut up, you fool.  And seeing that gripping, that hoppity hop of a boob that she had with his little red  socks cap on.  And he runs out and hustles people on the foosball table for money.  Yeah.  Mama, I want ninny.  That's what he says.  What does he say?  Mama, I want ninny.  Doesn't that just sound dirty?  Uh-huh.  That's interesting.  Okay, Anthony.  I found the report about Wow when, what's her name, flashed her boobs outside of the 
[00:45:00]  Today Show.  And I think it was Extra, did a whole, is this the Extra one, Rick?  Which one?  Track 14?  14, yeah.  Oh, okay.  Oh, oh.  Is there any way, do we still have that report that we did in Boston?  Their parents must be proud.  I got that somewhere.  You have that somewhere?  I have everything we've done.  We need that so bad.  That was the first news story done on Wow on television.  I could have it by, yeah, I could have it maybe by the end of the week. 
[00:45:30]  The guy was our buddy.  The guy that came down to do the report.  Our buddy.  Yeah.  And he ended up working in New York and he's since got fired, but he shows up for the  report on Wow.  Man, he suckered us.  Uh-huh.  But we're smart now.  Yeah, we were learning.  We were learning back then.  We thought everyone was our friend.  Everyone's our pal.  Look, the guy's hanging out with us.  He's got the camera crew.  They're laughing.  He's drinking beer.  He had an earring in his ear, and there was an underage girl at the studio that day. 
[00:46:00]  Oh, Jesus.  That's right.  And this girl, we didn't know she was underage at the time, was all over this reporter.  Uh-huh.  He was loving life.  Yeah.  He's like, you guys have a great show.  I can't believe this stuff you do, blah, blah, blah.  And he's like, yeah.  And we're like, yeah, man, hang out and film whatever you want.  You know, we're looking forward to seeing your piece on Wow on the Fox News.  I just want to hang out with you guys, man.  I love the show.  Oh, wow, it was great, man.  Let me just film everything.  Get as wild as you can, man, because I've been listening.  Remember, last week, you guys did this. 
[00:46:30]  Oh, reciting.  He had done his research.  I mean, the guy was smooth, and he wasn't dressed in a suit or anything.  He was just dressed like a regular guy, hanging out with O&A on Whip Mount Wednesday.  So we just dropped our guard completely and put on one of the most debaucherous shows we had done.  Ever.  Well, it airs that night.  We tune in the news.  There he is, standing in a suit and tie.  No earring.  No earring.  His hair is all done.  Now he's like the professional news guy. 
[00:47:00]  Just, what you're about to see is disgusting.  Like, he was disgusted.  And he's showing clips.  I like you bastard.  You had a half-naked 15-year-old in your lap an hour ago.  Did you ever talk to him about it?  No.  You never talked to these people again.  We tried to get him on the phone, but yeah.  Yeah.  You're right.  You never speak to him again.  All the clips that he was videotaping, the cameraman was videotaping that he was in were all gone.  All gone.  Those were all gone. 
[00:47:30]  It was just clips of just, I don't know, crimes in progress.  And he's out there just bashing, wow, bashing us, everything.  And when he finally gets done with it, we'll play it eventually.  I'm sure I hope you'll find it.  I got to find it.  It's going to take me a day or two.  They go back to the anchors.  You know, it's like back to you in the studio.  They're newsreaders.  Newsreaders.  They go back to you in the studio.  The one guy looks up and just goes, their parents must be proud. 
[00:48:00]  Like, he's just disgusted.  Their parents must be proud.  Their parents must be proud.  We've got to get that one.  Back to you.  Back to you.  In local sports, the Celtics lost another game.  Anyway, don't you hate the press?  Don't you hate the press?  No, I love it because they're so ridiculous.  I love it.  It is.  If we were politicians or something, we'd be screwed.  We understand we'll never get a fair shake as far as the press goes.  We knew going into the Bill O'Reilly thing recently. 
[00:48:30]  In this line of work, though, like the show that we put on, forget about it.  Who cares what they print?  It makes for great radio because of all the silly stuff they say about it.  That they get wrong.  They try to make things worse than they really are, which I got no problem with.  Who cares?  Arrogant, lying scumbags.  They are.  They want to sensationalize stories.  They want to make it like they have an inside edge on a story.  They editorialize no matter how much they just say they're reporting news.  I don't care.  One of the best reporter shreddings ever because years ago, Walter Winchell was. 
[00:49:00]  Shredding.  Walter Winchell was the big boy and Jack Parr was hosting the Tonight Show.  I don't know the exact show, but I know they didn't like each other.  Is this the last time you watched TV?  You got an old kinescope of that, do you?  Yeah, I was watching TV and Voss was writing a joke.  Will Winchell would bring down anybody and he was attacking Jack Parr and Jack Parr was the host of the Tonight Show.  And he shredded Winchell every night and he finally ruined him.  And it's just the greatest thing I ever heard is that Arrogant scumbag was ruined by a guy on television. 
[00:49:30]  You know what I mean?  He was so used to getting the wrong way.  You got the power.  All right.  Two other things you want to play before break.  Sorry.  It was all right.  It stunk.  It was a little filler thing.  It was good.  A little filler.  I fucked it up like it was the story of the week.  Sit down, folks.  But we needed to...  Here it comes.  Buckle up.  We needed a stall, though.  We were queuing up news clips.  So it was cute.  Cute.  Hold on to your hats.  And we make 13 episodes out of that story.  So we encouraged wowing on live TV. 
[00:50:00]  The wow sign.  I think girl's actually doing it.  So this girl...  Oh, we put a bounty out.  Yeah.  It was in all the rag magazines, as a matter of fact.  The star and all those magazines picked up on it.  I think it was like $2,000.  Yeah, something like that.  Well, first girl that wows on either, I forget, live TV or the Today Show in general.  I think it was the Today Show.  We wanted the Today Show.  I mean, it was live TV.  The opportunity, if you ever watched that dopey show, was just wide open. 
[00:50:30]  They got the rubes from the Midwest holding up their,  Hi, happy birthday, Jim Bob signs.  Not no more.  No.  Now they're on a delay.  They're on a delay because of us.  But we looked at that opportunity and just said,  All right, this is a perfect spot for some boobs.  So we put the bounty out there and a couple of the rag magazines reported on it.  And sure enough, it finally happened.  Yeah.  And well, this clip has been all over the world now.  It's all over the Internet.  It's all over the place.  And it was one of our listeners. 
[00:51:00]  She's there, opens up her shirt perfectly as they're scanning the crowd.  The cameraman, whoever that guy was, thank you,  has to be a fan of the show because as they're panning,  because it looks like the camera was on a dolly.  He was turning the camera to keep the girl in the frame as long as he could.  I know that guy was a fan of the show.  And then the media just exploded.  Holy ass, you know, naked boobs on the Today Show this morning.  Every news station in America and pretty much all over the world 
[00:51:30]  did a piece on it showing the clip.  Well, here's the girl talking about the whole damn thing on Extra.  And another TV surprise came on the Today Show  when an audience member gave Matt, Katie, and America an eyeful.  Barry Nolan talks to the Today Show flasher in this Extra exclusive.  The panning camera shot of the enthusiastic Today Show audience.  It's a staple of morning TV like coffee and cornflakes. 
[00:52:00]  Only in this take, one woman got a little too enthusiastic.  What are your parents going to say?  At this point, I'm not mentioning it.  I'm hoping they won't find out about it.  Well, Susie Greenberg, guess what?  Your parents must know by now.  Susie got some television exposure on Wednesday's Today Show  when she suddenly shed her shirt.  Watch Matt and Katie's shocked reaction.  We're not fixing too much down here, Katie.  And, um, okay, yeah.  Why did you do it?  I wanted to tell the world that I support Opie and Anthony. 
[00:52:30]  And for a thousand bucks from Opie and Anthony,  the outrageous morning radio jocks at 102.7 in New York.  Afternoons, whatever.  The stunt's aptly named Whip Them Out Wednesday.  It's the same shot every day.  Why don't they just use the same shot every day?  So we figured we'd throw in bare breasts.  But the viewers on the West Coast never got to partake in the fun.  NBC did a rather obvious edit for the folks living in the Pacific time zone.  Did you think through this whole thing about being on the Today Show? 
[00:53:00]  I don't think I realized what kind of stature the Today Show has.  I thought this would be a minor New York story.  Well, hey, this isn't the first time folks have flashed the flesh on the early morning boob tube.  Check out the British equivalent of the Today Show in 1995.  It's going to the sunny weather.  Right, in good old England.  The gimmick is this.  The weather guy sort of bounces across a floating weather map.  All of a sudden, in blows serial streaker Mark Roberts. 
[00:53:30]  You're on the clipboard.  Well, Americans like to bear all too, you know.  Well, just this May, an irate fan showed controversial baseball pitcher John Rocker what he thought of the Brave star.  And who could forget the 1974 Oscar ceremony when a streaker flashes the peace sign and a piece of his you-know-what at host David Nibben.  I guess times haven't changed a bit.  Just ask Katie and Matt.  Greenberg didn't get arrested.  She slipped away before the cops could grab her. 
[00:54:00]  Lucky her.  Then it's like, all right, we don't have enough for like a full segment on this.  Let's get some British streaker and something else.  We can't talk to her for a whole segment.  It's called filler, Anthony.  Filler.  You need filler for the story.  Right.  Don't you love all the little things that tie together like on the morning's boob tube?  Boob tube.  Good thing it wasn't below the waist.  All over the country. 
[00:54:30]  Yeah, and everyone was cockeyed.  And then Matt Lauer happened to be on Jay Leno a couple days later.  Yeah.  And of course Jay had to bring it up.  How about the woman that took her shirt off in the line?  Which I hear you've had a little fun.  We had a lot of fun with it.  Did that shock you?  You know what it was?  We were outside and if you've seen the 8.30 in the show every morning, the camera pans the crowd outside.  And what I do is since I can't see where the camera is sometimes, I look at the monitor.  And I'm standing there.  It happened to be with Ann Curry.  Katie was in Philadelphia at the time. 
[00:55:00]  And I'm looking at the monitor.  And I see the people go by.  And normally, you know, hi, mom.  Hey, Kansas.  Go Jayhawks.  And all of a sudden, the camera goes by and this woman looks at the camera and goes.  And my first thought was it was one of those kind of like plastic pieces that you wear on Halloween, you know, that they weren't real.  They might have been, yeah, when you think about it.  And then after like 45 seconds of staring at it, I said, you know, those are real.  And, you know, she had written the word wow on her stomach, which apparently is, you know,  W.O.W. stands for the stupid radio station promotion in New York called Whip Them Out Wednesdays. 
[00:55:30]  And so she whipped them out.  Well, it's not a super promotion anymore.  They just got a lot of publicity.  I think it actually said powwow, but gravity had covered the, uh.  Really?  The top word.  Oh!  But what's weird about it is think about this lady.  At some point during her day, that day, she had to get in front of a mirror and say, yeah, these are ready for national television.  And I've got to be honest with you, speak as one boob man to another.  These were not that great.  I mean, I've seen a lot better boobs than these. 
[00:56:00]  And yet she exposes them on a morning show.  But, you know, it's good in, what, six years of having the outdoor studio.  I think that's the first.  There was one other little weird thing.  But that's the first time anyone has, you know, gone.  Don't say that now.  But, you know, we have, most of the people are great.  They're very wholesome people.  He's seen better boobs.  Yeah, he sits next to one every morning.  Oh, I hope, I really hope he's killed the night before one of his kids gets married.  He is such a dull.  And here's what annoys me about this scumbag.  Yeah. 
[00:56:30]  It was funny when he said the power, a little joke.  But then he starts going into how these are not really good, but you can just see him bombing in the Tonight Show.  And Jay is trying to cover up.  Listen to that again sometimes.  Jay's great at covering up when you're bombing.  Bombing there because people are like, all right.  You're getting a pretty good radio promotion there, didn't you?  It's a wonderful.  Oh, God.  I absolutely hate him.  Go Jayhawks.  That's what you want to see in the morning.  A bunch of hillbillies from Kansas.  They're fat family members.  Doug, he couldn't even realize that they don't have to be great boobs. 
[00:57:00]  And they are nice.  I've seen them.  They're fine.  But he wanted to, you know what?  The way he was coming off sound is like, I've seen a million of them.  You know, Jay, when you're like me, dime a dozen.  Getting laid all the time.  I'd give her a chili dog in a second.  The old chili dog.  Chili dogs are the best.  Doug, what's going on?  Hey, what's happening?  Hey, Doug.  Listen, I used to work at 56. 
[00:57:30]  And that piece of tape was one of the favorites around the station for a long time.  What, in Boston?  Yeah.  What was the name of the reporter?  Bill Rapley.  Bill Rapley.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Wait, you were the editor on that story?  Yes.  Where he made us look like tools, even though he loved the show?  Yeah, exactly.  Oh, so you saw the raw footage of that?  Oh, absolutely.  Wow.  I saw it.  Everybody saw it for days and weeks afterwards.  Yeah, there was some hardcore stuff on there.  Can you explain, because you've seen it enough, some of the stuff that was on that tape when 
[00:58:00]  you guys filmed that day in our studio that never made the piece?  Oh, jeez.  I remember seeing Bill with a big smile on his face a couple of times.  Yeah, the whole time.  Uh, yeah.  The, uh, the two girls in the studio.  Oh, unbelievable.  And you can't tell me you didn't know that those girls were a little on the younger side.  Oh, no.  I mean, everybody who looked at it was like, what the?  You've got to be kidding me. 
[00:58:30]  Oh, we're artists, man.  What, R. Kelly was there?  We were all hanging out?  Ah!  Artistic, right.  We were doing an avant-garde day on the O.P. and Anthony show.  Yeah.  Avant-garde.  On the parking lot, too, man.  I mean, they were all over the place.  Yeah.  But none of that made the, uh, the piece.  Uh, what's that?  None of that stuff made the piece.  No, he put his suit on and stood out by the highway and just lambasted us.  Took his earring off and then gave us the business.  What was his name?  Bill, uh, Rappley?  Bill Rappley. 
[00:59:00]  Whatever.  Well, he's obviously a flunky.  I never heard of him.  What's he doing now, you know?  Uh, yeah, he was in New York for a while and, uh, on Fox, I think.  But, uh, I haven't heard, seen or heard of him for a while.  But that tape was a fave around the newsroom, huh?  Yeah, yeah.  Well, Bill was a big partier, too.  He used to like to, uh, to, uh, he'd show up every once in a while with the red eyes and everything else.  Well, why didn't he present the story in that light?  Like, with him enjoying it or just at least being, uh, objective about it. 
[00:59:30]  He, he totally bashed us.  Yeah, he made sure that he, he killed us.  The Boston news media would never have it.  Yeah, you're right.  You're right.  You guys had to look like, uh, you know, the degenerate that you really are.  That's cool.  We don't mind it at all.  Just get our names right.  All right, Doug, thank you.  Hey, no sweat, man.  Peace.  Bye.  Yeah, that was a broad video.  Oh, Jesus.  Look, I just remember certain things that went down on the conference room table that was also videotaped. 
[01:00:00]  That was the same chick.  That was, that was later.  No, that wasn't during our show.  What?  What?  I didn't say anything.  I love you, too.  Where in the world is Matt Lauer?  Sorry.  There you go.  I'm just bringing up something that I think's stupid.  Where in the world is Matt?  Who cares? 
[01:00:30]  All right.  Those are the days.  Dude, start watching TV so you can help us out with this radio show.  I don't know what that is.  I've never heard of the where in the world is Matt.  No.  When's it on?  What time, first of all?  It's today's show.  It's the day's show.  What time does that start?  And it's probably one of their biggest promotions they have done in the last five years.  Good.  I'm glad I don't know it.  I'm a 33-year-old guy and I like getting oral treats.  I shouldn't know that.  I love the fact that we do a radio show with a caveman, a guy that has no clue about topical stuff. 
[01:01:00]  I realize I'm an opinionated ass.  I'll explain really fast.  They do this promotion with Matt where every morning you've got to tune in to try to figure out where Matt is today.  And he'll be somewhere in the world.  There you go.  Really?  He could be in front of the Great Wall of China one day and then next to the pyramids the next.  What time does the Today Show start? 
[01:01:30]  I don't know.  How would I know that?  My TV should be coming hopefully tomorrow.  Why would I know that even if I had my TV?  What is this magic box with visions of another world in it?  Ugh.  What is this magic box and how old is she?  Me don't know how to work them.  You're like primitive man.  I'm Tim Technology.  I just don't have a TV.  You are not Tim Technology.  I got to get a TV.  I don't have a TV.  You're polypathetic. 
[01:02:00]  Yeah, but so much.  Chip Chinless.  All right.  We have to take a break here.  Yeah.  So, yeah.  Wow is here.  That's why we're spending a lot of time on it today.  The season has begun.  And it's just going to grow like you cannot believe.  Uh-huh.  Just wait and see.  Is it going to grow like that big tumor we saw at the end of yesterday's show?  That rocked.  Someone, I guess, got really pissed off about that segment and called Ken.  Stop it.  Super General Manager Ken Stevens.  How did Ken Stevens field that call with another PSA? 
[01:02:30]  He goes, yeah.  And they try to spit it and make believe, you know, they care about women and that women  should get mammograms.  Oh, we were trying to spit it?  Yeah, it was.  If you were listening to yesterday's show and you're a lady and, you know, you're not  getting a mammogram after that segment, you know.  Come on.  We also had a cancerous esophagus.  I guarantee because of that show a bunch of women are making appointments now.  And who cares what your motives were, you stupid thinking for other people whore? 
[01:03:00]  I don't care what their motives were when they brought those guys in on what the hell  was that, but I still quit smoking, so shut your stupid mouth.  There you go.  Your motives are unimportant.  It's what other people do with it when they hear it.  How's Ken Fielding that call, Opie?  Did he say he's going to react?  I believe he...  He's a jerk.  I believe he...  No, man.  We work for...  You know what?  I got to say it.  Yeah.  It is...  If you're a radio guy, it's cool to, like, hate your bosses and stuff.  Uh-huh.  And, you know, Ken is...  He's a little fruity and stuff, and he's a little...  He is.  He's a little, like, you feel like you're working with your father type thing. 
[01:03:30]  But the guy goes to bat for us.  Well, I'm just commenting on that PSA that the Sikhs had put on our program and kind of  got through Ken.  Yeah, he had a moment of weakness.  That's what I meant.  He's not perfect.  Yeah.  But, uh, God damn it, he supports what we do, and he goes to bat for us, unlike, uh,  someone that still works at AAF, you dick.  No, I will not rest, Dave, until you're fired.  That will be someday.  I've been waiting four years, and I'll wait another six. 
[01:04:00]  I don't care.  That will be someday when he finally gets his ass thrown out of there with his 70s gay  porno mustache.  Okay, I'm going to go into gay porno.  Sell the house.  All right, uh, Anthony?  Yes?  We have the Irish Earl, drunk Irish Earl, and Asian Earl here today trying out for Black  Earl's job.  All right, wow, two at once.  How are we going to deal with that?  And, uh, don't worry, we won't focus on wow all day, but, uh, it's definitely, definitely  a big deal today.  Yeah. 
[01:04:30]  We've got other things to talk about as well.  Feeling good.  We've just got to figure out what that is going to be.  No, actually, Kreskin coming in today.  Oh, great.  I know Kreskin gives us horrible radio, so make sure you listen so you can hear the  uncomfortableness of Ant and I.  You talk about Jay Leno carrying a segment.  Holy ass.  Watch that.  Watch how we carry Kreskin through another awful, awful, awful radio segment.  The amazing Kreskin.  I like Kreskin.  I got to disagree.  You do, do you?  I really do.  I've been watching him since I was a child. 
[01:05:00]  This will be the third thing he does on our show, and every time he says it's going  to be, it's going to be newsworthy.  The whole world is going to talk about Opie and Anthony because of something I did on  your show.  Now he's, today he's going to do something with, uh, Osama bin Laden.  Yeah.  Something with bin Laden.  I don't know what that is.  We usually, he has these huge ideas that he says are going to get us national exposure,  and, uh, we just blow him off all the time.  So today, are we actually, all right, we're, we're going to humor him and let him do his, 
[01:05:30]  his thing.  We're going to, we're going to go with it.  All right.  We'll see what happens as we do it, but it will be uncomfortable.  Wait, I'm having a premonition.  Hold it.  Well, I'm seeing the future.  Oh, this sucks.  The bit sucks.  Oh my God.  His segment's awful.  National exposure.  Hopefully he'll have a stroke during our show.  You know, why don't you guys just be nice for once?  Oh, stop it. 
[01:06:00]  National exposure.  Go out on the street.  Look at the sun with those big magnifying glass, uh, eyeglasses.  And burn out your retinas.  Burn out, burn two holes in your head.  And then look at what's in one of the holes.  The card I picked.  That'd be a trick, Creskin.  Rock.  How old are you?  18.  How old are you?  Oh, you're sure you're doing.  Wow.  Fabulous.  Wow.  Holy ravioli.  Opie.  And Anthony.  And E.  And we're back with the Opie and Anthony show. 
[01:06:30]  Got to apologize for that one.  Sorry.  We did like 50 minutes of radio, so we had to make up for lost time.  Yes.  We hate when we have to do that, but thanks for being a faithful listener and, uh, bearing  with us.  Right, Anthony?  Roy.  Whippin' Mile Wednesday is here.  The season has begun.  Make sure you get wow on your car, whether it's a bumper sticker or a homemade wow sign.  If the ladies feel like it, they will flash you on the way home from work.  The ladies have been instructed not to flash anyone that does not have a wow on their car. 
[01:07:00]  So if you're a listener of the show, you might as well put one on and see what happens,  okay?  See what happens in need.  A lot of people want to know how they get their wow bumper stickers.  Oh!  Not all the stations that we broadcast on have the, uh, the wow stickers, Anthony.  No.  A lot of them do, but some, uh, you know, they're a little lazy or whatever.  Not really, uh, want to support it.  Not sure we're going to be around.  Yes!  Don't want to spend the extra money just in case they're the next station dropping the Opie and 
[01:07:30]  Anthony show.  Right.  Uh, but if you send a self-addressed stamped, uh, envelope, uh, to us here in New York,  we'll send you the, the New York version, okay?  Uh, the address is on our website, opandanthony.com, or if you have a pen real fast, it's 888 7th  Avenue, New York, New York, 10106, okay?  Self-addressed stamped envelope, we send them right out to you.  Right.  That address again, 888 7th Avenue, New York, New York, 10106.  Okay?  There you go. 
[01:08:00]  What, Jim?  Uh, nothing.  You were on the phone during commercials.  Is everything okay?  Yeah, talking to my friend Jay's, helping me with the television, yes.  Okay.  I'm in a good mood.  This guy's making more deals than, like, a Wall Street, uh, executive during the day.  Moving is a nightmare.  You started moving two months ago.  No, no, no.  Silly goose, I moved a month ago.  I had nothing.  Everything I owned, you understand, is garbage.  My bed I bought from my friend, Artie. 
[01:08:30]  It already had springs broken.  I paid 200 bucks for it four years ago.  You used someone else's bed?  I didn't say it was a good idea.  I'm just saying, I've been living in squalor.  You saw my apartment.  And it was all, it would be more hygienic to live in the sea of a cadaver.  All right.  That would have to be a big sea.  But that's why.  So, you know, people who are...  That cadaver's name?  Eileen McNamara.  Oh.  While our family cries.  I can't believe it's Christmas Eve and she's dead. 
[01:09:00]  Oh, well.  I was just talking about our sexual prowess.  Oh, no, no.  I'm talking about her actually dying and everybody crying around her.  We all laugh and high-five each other.  We were thinking two different things here.  Maybe we take out our things and we have a sword fight.  Why not?  But no, I'm not going to get deals.  People are helping me and I appreciate everybody's help.  Because I really...  Everything I owned was garbage, dude.  Right.  I never bought a couch in my life.  This is the first time I bought a couch.  Ever.  Yeah.  Yeah, I know that feeling.  Why am I shouting? 
[01:09:30]  I don't know.  It's a radio people.  Most guys hit 30 without ever, you know, buying a couch.  I lived at home until I was 30.  So you're not saying anything that's surprising.  I'm not sitting up here saying...  You're acting like a 23-year-old kid is buying brand-new couches.  No, no.  I think you buy your first couch when you hit 30.  You might be right.  All right, I'm not saying look for...  Before that, you drive around the neighborhood and see what looks good.  You think that's it or...  Oh, yes.  I'm not even kidding.  Yeah.  That's not what you did.  Especially, I swear to you, in college, that's what we did.  That's how we furnished our dorm rooms, our fraternity house.  I've done that. 
[01:10:00]  You go around the neighborhood and you see, you know, what's available.  No joke.  At our Pee-wee's Playhouse apartment that we had over there in Huntington, the party house,  the furniture was found that way.  And, you know, the arm was a little chewed up.  I guess they had a dog or something and the foam was coming out.  But a little duct tape, you know.  It gave the place character, right?  Oh, sure.  Character.  That's what you call it.  Sometimes you can get a nice box spring.  I'm serious.  And the worst thing is when you move and actually take the stuff with you to the next place. 
[01:10:30]  Because I did that.  Moved to another apartment.  I don't know how I acquired furniture.  It's just all of a sudden you end up with it.  Yeah.  It's time to move.  Maybe you've been roommates with some people and they leave and leave the furniture.  Then it comes your time to move and all of a sudden it's your furniture.  See, you're a germ freak, so you would never do that, obviously, right?  I'm not a germ freak.  Sleeping with another man in a bed or something, I heard.  I don't want...  You've got to accept it, though, and you'll realize, look, you have no money and you want  to sit on the couch when you're watching TV. 
[01:11:00]  It's, oh, you need a brick to prop up one of the legs.  Who cares?  Hey, look.  Gets the job done.  I have lived with awful furniture, always.  Yeah.  I had the same dresser since I was...  I'm 33 years old, and I've had the same dresser since I was 15.  But it's been all on the side.  I punch on the side because the Cowboys lost just some other, you know, awful reason.  I had to cover it with one of my own performance posters.  Jim Norton and the bad boys of comedy.  Me and stupid quarantine and my other dumb friends.  You remind me of something.  I had the same dresser since when I was, like, a little boy, eight or nine. 
[01:11:30]  Really?  It's like, it has the regular...  Shut up.  Use that word way too much then.  It had, you know, three drawers for your clothes, and then it had an open...  Oh, a little armoire.  Almost like a little...  No, almost like a little door.  Yeah.  You know, the dresser was only three feet high.  Yeah, just barely over your head.  Oh, yeah.  At the time, a little tussle wall hair sticking up over the...  As a little kid, it was a great place to hide from my bitch grandmother. 
[01:12:00]  Oh, really?  I would hide in there, and I still have the dresser to remind me of those awful days.  Precious!  Precious!  We're hiding, Precious!  Precious!  Do you still hide in there, do you?  I can't fit in there anymore, or I would.  I bet he does, though.  When he's having an argument at home, he'll probably put his leg in.  I'm trying to get in here.  Are you doing the hokey pokey?  I just recently, when my divorce proceedings started, bought furniture for the first time. 
[01:12:30]  That's what I'm saying.  How ridiculous is that?  You start buying new stuff in your 30s.  All right, so you know what it's like, though, but I'm saying...  But you're acting like it's a big deal.  Every guy goes through it.  I'm not saying, look, nobody gets me, man.  All right, I'm sure people have done this, but you're saying to me that I'm taking a long time, and I'm just saying...  It is taking a long time.  You're right.  I know that, but I never did this before.  I can't just go out, and I've got to be careful.  It's not like you've got to build it.  By the way...  Oh, here...  Did you hear that?  Okay. 
[01:13:00]  I just caught a little something of Norton there.  What?  He goes, I just...  I haven't done this.  It's new to me.  I want to be careful.  Because what will happen...  Unprotected anal with hookers.  You're right.  Good point.  But he wants to be careful in buying furniture.  Well, I had to buy a leather couch because when some of those fluids get on there, you don't want to have to take one for cover.  You want to just be able to go white...  What do you want to be careful about?  I'm white trash.  You don't get it.  I have white trash sensibilities and white trash taste, and I will buy garbage. 
[01:13:30]  I will.  So I have to go slow.  One thing at a time.  Relax.  I'm a compulsive lunatic.  I want it now.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  Oh, really?  Yes.  Oh, really?  Yes.  Oh, really?  Yes.  Really?  Yes.  There's a bug on the wall.  There's a bug.  Watch out.  Well, dude, we were in a place last night eating.  All right, if you want to bring me...  Dude, you're ridiculous.  Me and Opie...  You need to be Robbie Relax.  No.  No.  No.  Look, Ernie Earthy.  I was out with Opie and Down Syndrome Bowls last night. 
[01:14:00]  And your partner in crime.  And boss.  And boss.  Nightmare.  I'm taping you guys next time, by the way.  We're not.  We're not what I say.  Look, all here from Ben.  All here from Ben.  We go to Matt's Grill, which is a fine, fine restaurant on...  Where is it?  Eighth, I guess?  Nice little place to get some...  We don't go there.  We won't be going there again.  Boy, Ben.  They don't panic.  Yeah, the paparazzi will be waiting out there for the next month.  Waiting for the Opie and Anthony crew to come by for a freaking burger.  Now, first of all, Jim...  With their telescopic lenses from across the street, hoping to get a picture of Opie's long walks. 
[01:14:30]  Look at Ben's mule and no hair.  No furniture.  Now, first of all, Jim's not that bad, but with Ross.  You guys are the biggest dicks ever.  I'll never go to dinner with you guys again.  Yeah, Voss and Norton are ridiculous.  What?  Dicks!  Dicks!  Someone's going to poison your food.  This poor chick in there.  They were being obnoxious, right?  She's trying to be an actress.  She's in New York.  She doesn't want to be a waitress.  She's not a professional waitress.  You go to some of the nicer restaurants, and people really get into being waiters and waitresses. 
[01:15:00]  It's their profession.  This is just a place trying to make extra money on the side.  She's trying to break into acting.  These douches...  No, no, no.  Rich starts...  Rich can't try...  Tries to pick her up immediately.  Hey, baby.  I bet you are an actress.  Right.  As a second...  Before we even say anything...  Oh, then he pulled his line.  Can I buy you a house?  Can I buy you a house?  Oh, he did?  Of course.  He pulled that one.  He goes, you'll be mine by the end of the meal.  Exactly.  So why would me involve us, Dicks?  I didn't say it.  I didn't kind of...  Oh, God.  I darted it. 
[01:15:30]  Then these guys changed their order so many times that there was no doubt in my mind and  Ben's mind that the order was going to be effed up.  All I ordered was a Caesar salad and a turkey burger.  How complicated is that?  Get it, hole.  It wasn't that complicated.  But how stupid are you when the waitress goes, okay, you guys really effed with me, so I'm  going to read the order back and you didn't say anything.  Because she read Caesar salad.  I don't think she did.  No, she didn't.  What happened, Norton, they forgot something of yours and you lost your mind. 
[01:16:00]  Dude, he obsesses to the point where you're...  It's no fun.  If I could have gotten away with it, I would have bitten her face.  If I wouldn't have went to prison, I would have bitten her face.  I got a real pet peeve.  If you can't do your job, don't do it.  You're freaking out.  I tip.  I'm always cool.  I'm joking with the lady, but I wasn't mean to her.  I wasn't like, hey, get me that.  I'm never bossy or mean, so I don't want to piss my food.  No, no, no, listen, the bread didn't come in about two seconds, so Jim's like, the bread's  going through the wall when I get it.  This is bull.  I want my bread.  Oh, my God. 
[01:16:30]  I need my bread now.  Are you freaking out?  You're going to have a fat, carbohydrate, eating nothing.  And it wasn't ten seconds.  It was a while and we're all looking around like, where's the goddamn bread?  Bring me bread, whore.  Jim, you made our dining experience miserable.  No, the cockroach on the wall made it.  All right, listen.  Shut up.  It was a roach.  I saw it.  There was a Puerto Rican following it on the wall.  It was a roach.  Anthony, there was, I swear to you, a tiny, when I say tiny, look what I'm making.  All right.  Tiny, right?  About a quarter inch long. 
[01:17:00]  Little bug walking up the wall behind me.  And where do they come from?  Bigger bugs.  He sees the bug.  Now it has ruined his whole night.  It's like it's New York.  It's a restaurant.  They're everywhere.  I agree with you.  And so, a lot of things are everywhere.  She might be on a period.  I don't need her to throw in the rag on the wall.  I know it's around.  I don't have to look at it.  I got to agree with Jim as far as roaches go.  But it wasn't a roach.  It wasn't a roach?  No, it wasn't a roach. 
[01:17:30]  It was a roach.  And then he wants to walk out.  Like, that's it.  It's got to be in my burger, too.  I'm like, dude, will you relax?  Dude, I don't like bugs.  Take a look at your burger.  And then my stupid salad didn't come.  And the food was actually good.  I'm not saying that the place sucks, because the food was tasty.  Fine.  I wanted the bread.  It didn't come.  Where's the goddamn salad?  And then the burger comes.  The little man brought me the burger, and there's a bug on the wall.  I'm not happy.  I'm picky when I eat, and I want my check immediately so I can go.  And the coffee's sunk.  He's also trashed.  The check came, and I was dodging her. 
[01:18:00]  No, then he goes, they better take money off this bill.  What?  Or I'll bite her face.  And then, so she comes back.  She didn't hear any of this.  She goes, you know, I feel kind of bad.  And so, you know, coffee and dessert on us.  No, cappuccino.  That's on me.  I'm thinking it should be.  Scalding in your stupid, forgetful face.  Don't do me any favors with a $2 coffee.  Take off the salad you forgot.  I can say if it does, Norm, because I heard that the roach actually brought out your food.  Did that happen?  Big antennae waving around, six legs holding all different items, a salad in one, your burger 
[01:18:30]  in the other.  No?  I'm sorry.  I cannot have a roach.  One time I was eating at a diner.  A roach has disgust me and grossed me out.  Here's a story.  Me and boss were eating a diner one time with another comedian, Cary Carabas.  And I believe it was Cary.  We're eating, and I'm eating my fries, and they're very good, until a baby cockroach crawls  out from underneath the fries I was just eating.  God damn.  That was disgusting.  That was disgusting.  A little bugger.  Oh, my God.  Hold on. 
[01:19:00]  What did you do then?  I continued eating.  What do you think I did?  I called the awful-haired waiter, because he had the worst comb-over I've ever seen.  Old cancer head.  I called him over.  I thought his head was brutal.  I called him over, and I'm like, I didn't make a scene, though, because he was a nice  guy, and I just pointed, and he goes, oh, I'm sorry.  And he did no check.  We just left.  And I tipped him, because it wasn't his fault.  Yeah, the bug was like 10 feet up in the air.  I don't care.  10 feet up in the air.  Whatever.  No, it wasn't.  It's not a flying wallenda.  It was a roach.  It was on the wall, right behind his blind locks. 
[01:19:30]  And if there's one on the wall, there are a crap load in the kitchen.  Yeah.  Then you should never.  Babies, adults, families.  Then you should never eat out in New York again, because have you read the stories in  the paper?  They say pretty much every restaurant has them.  It's impossible to.  You're right.  It's impossible to get rid of them.  But when I, like this guy, this one was Vinnie Visible, and when they start coming out.  You're awful.  You're already awful.  When they start coming out, and they're on the wall.  That's a bad sign.  Bad sign.  There's so much of the roach areas are crowded. 
[01:20:00]  He's got to go out and be seen.  The roach areas are crowded.  All right.  But follow this logic.  Follow this logic.  Oh, yeah.  I understand his phobia and all.  And I understand your phobias as well.  And I understand all that.  But when it doesn't make sense logically, that's when I get pissed off.  I go, Jim, okay, there's a bug.  You're thinking it's a cockroach.  Ben and I are like, there's no way it's a cockroach.  I'm like, do you understand that the old place you lived in was probably filled with huge cockroaches?  Not only that, probably mice and possibly rats running around your apartment. 
[01:20:30]  Listen to what he said to this one, Ed.  And we all saw Jim Norton Cribs on foundrymusic.com.  He lived in a hellhole before he moved into New York.  A couple.  What was your answer to that?  The same answer I'll give you now because I went there again last night to pick up things.  There were no bugs in that apartment.  Impossible.  It's not.  You had fungus in your shower and something on your closet.  You had a huge hole in your ceiling that was dripping rainwater from the roof. 
[01:21:00]  The food in the sink.  The food.  Are you insane?  I'm telling you.  I was there last night.  I had to go pick up.  I had to sit down.  I guarantee the mice had to run in the place when you guys were sleeping.  There was a family down there.  You're insane to think there was no critters in that place.  I would have seen them.  The only critters we had were silverfish from the basement would come up.  That's the only...  I don't like them either.  Sounds so nice and exotic.  Yeah.  Yeah, I got silverfish in this.  It's a huge, disgusting, slimy-looking bug. 
[01:21:30]  It's like a centipede.  I might have had centipedes.  That hangs out in the shower.  We had some centipedes.  They were awful.  Centipedes?  That's all stuff in the basement.  We did...  Look, I know you had centipedes.  You'll admit to that.  I don't lie.  Why would I lie?  I showed you the mold.  My walls were alive.  I would tell you if we had a bug.  You had bugs.  We didn't.  Dude, I'm telling you.  I'll go even one.  Look, will you accept the fact you had microscopic bugs that are probably more creepy and more disturbing  than actual cockroaches?  No.  Without a doubt creepy.  We also have a neutrino shooting through us from the sun. 
[01:22:00]  I mean, I'm not going to worry about them being in my apartment either.  It happens.  But you're insane to think a restaurant that is definitely trying to keep things clean and there's  a bug on the wall.  I just don't want to see it.  I just don't want to see it.  But he's insane to think that he wasn't living amongst all this crap in your old plate.  He didn't see it.  Dude, I would...  I've dug up the corner.  No, no, no, Ant.  I understand.  He's never seen a bug, but he's claiming there are none.  No, no, no.  Because I would have seen them.  You're crazy to think that.  Dude, I dug up the papers or whatever.  I picked stuff up.  You would have found...  I've been in a roaches just in place. 
[01:22:30]  I'm telling you.  Old jizz cloths?  Yeah, exactly.  Well, no, usually they just get up and leave when you're done.  The thing with it, when you have a roach is people know they have roaches.  You see one occasionally in the sink or the wall.  You just do.  Right.  And I saw none.  Never.  No.  All right.  Well...  I'm telling you.  Why would I make that up?  I would tell you.  It would have been funnier, actually, to show you.  And do you know how much flack I caught because of that stupid kid's toys that are all over?  Somebody was writing me, oh, you're a child molester.  No, I'm not.  Because of the stuff that was... 
[01:23:00]  Dude, you had stuff in your apartment no freaking man in his 30s had.  Thank you.  Exactly.  Roommate's girlfriend, though.  Yeah, it was not belonging to a man in his 30s.  You had Powderpuff...  No, I didn't.  What was the Powderpuff...  Powerpuff Girls.  No, the Powderpuff ice cream thing.  Dude, that was not mine.  That was Jimmy's girlfriend.  That's not mine.  He had the little, like, kitty cat thing.  What was that, that Boo Boo Kitty thing?  It was Hello Kitty.  And no, he didn't.  How did you know it?  I looked at it every day for three years.  It wasn't my Barbie stuff.  How old is she?  25 or 24. 
[01:23:30]  Yeah, 25.  Girls at that age are always having little toys.  I didn't say it was a normal, healthy household.  Look at the conditions she was able to live in.  That's true.  That's what freaked us out the most, is that there was actually a girl living amongst that environment.  And they're actually moving, too.  I've got to say, the gym.  They had a really nice place.  Yeah, they're just buying a place together as a couple.  And, of course, Larry Lonely mows into New York.  That doesn't follow the formula.  What formula?  Larry Normal.  What?  Larry Lonely.  Larry Lonely.  Oh, I thought you said normal. 
[01:24:00]  No.  Which goes against the...  No, I would do Abby Normal and then do a little Marty Feldman.  We'd all laugh and hug and compare sides.  I didn't hear you, but Larry Normal goes against the rules of the bit.  No, I know.  It's not even my bit, so I can't even, you know, it's Jimmy.  It's Jim Florentine, as you said that before.  I have to credit him.  But, no, dude, I'm easy.  I tip you, but we ate in Boston together.  Okay?  You see the way I'm in a nightclub?  Where?  At Sauncy's where my...  Oh, man.  Yeah, yeah, you're right.  That really was.  You guys got effed on that.  Dude, and that was...  Don't blame me. 
[01:24:30]  I don't blame you.  I hope not.  What's the matter, Mr. Pratt?  Bugs got your tongue?  I wouldn't give you the skin off a grape.  I think a lot of people can relate to this, though.  You know, you should never be the one without cash when you go out to dinner with a large party.  Yeah.  We're at Sauncy's beautiful restaurant on Newbury Street.  Yeah.  And it's like 10 of us, and the bill comes out to like 500 bucks.  And so now we're thinking you've got to tip 20%, you know?  Uh-huh.  So we need 600 bucks. 
[01:25:00]  So the bill goes around the table.  Nice.  So many people have been in this situation.  Bill goes around the table.  I'm the last guy to look at Bill.  Oh, man.  How'd you work out to be that guy?  You're never that guy.  Not to mention richest.  He's last and the richest.  Look at me.  Am I rich?  No, but compared to us, you are.  Dick.  So it goes around the table, right?  Now the bill comes back to me with all the money that was collected as it made the round.  Now, did people study the bill?  Oh, yeah.  Let me look. 
[01:25:30]  I'll pull out a couple of ones, and I'll do this, and just pass it on with 10 bucks.  We need 600 bucks.  Yeah.  It gets to me.  There's 300 in the bill.  So I just casually said, ah, well.  How many people?  10.  10 people.  Well, $600 had to be shelled out.  Elected.  So why the hell didn't everybody cough up their 30 bucks?  60 bucks.  All right.  So you're in a weird situation.  Terrible, man.  You're in a weird situation. 
[01:26:00]  You've got to say something, but you don't want to be, you know, a dick.  So I'm like, ah, wow.  We're a little short here.  Kind of saying it like that.  Like, hey, we're a little short here.  As I look around, everyone makes believe they didn't hear me, and then they start looking  down at the table.  So why did they show 300 bucks?  Oh, my God.  Dude, look.  And then I find out it's Psycho Tim ordering $200 bottles of wine.  $200 bottles of wine.  Yeah.  Psycho Tim.  Because, dude, I've got to explain, too, because it was after the Norton show. 
[01:26:30]  We got there really late.  We went in there for appetizers.  It wasn't even really full meals.  Oh, really?  It was just like, hey, we're a little hungry.  You know, maybe a couple beers, a glass of wine, and some apps.  No, I ate and I had, I think, a steak.  The food was amazing, and I had a salad.  It came to, like, 40 bucks, whatever, plus beverages.  And I threw in 80, because I'm like, you know, it's a nice place.  You've got to tip.  Everyone just tips.  No, but you don't drink, so you should be out of it.  You know something?  Let me explain something.  Let me explain something.  Tim, I was going to explain. 
[01:27:00]  Relax over there, by the way.  I don't know.  I'm backing you up.  I'm backing you up.  All right.  Hold on.  I just wanted to tell you my policy on going out and eating with especially a larger group  of people.  I don't care you don't effing drink.  I don't care you had a mother effing salad.  Hold on.  I don't care.  One guy orders a $200 bottle of wine, and you're getting goddamn tap water.  You divvy the effing bill up with all the people and shell it out, because that's how 
[01:27:30]  it's got to work.  It doesn't work any other way.  I don't want somebody holding the bill with their little goddamn calculator, going into  their change purse, and pulling crap out.  Split the goddamn bill.  Dude, I've got to call you out on this, though.  No.  Hold on.  What?  I understand your theory.  That makes sense if you go out to dinner with a couple that will have a couple beers, a  couple Jack and Cokes, and an espresso with Sambuca.  But when you get the bill back, my friend, and half the bill is for alcohol, that three 
[01:28:00]  out of the six people are drinking, and your alcohol bill is more than the food bill, it  doesn't work as well.  I don't care.  Your ex-mother-in-law used to drink about $100 alone.  You're right.  There were times, though, where I took the liquor bill, and I would pay that.  And I never argued the point, by the way.  Oh, you know something?  I used to pay for that, though.  I made sure I did pay for that.  Yeah.  I'm saying those are different circumstances, too, because believe me, I didn't want those 
[01:28:30]  people to be there.  Believe me.  And you're right normally, dude.  I agree with you.  Divvy it up.  Actually, you know who got me out of that habit?  It was fat, cheap Patrice.  Patrice is the cheapest, and I hope you're listening, you cheap scumbag.  He always wants, he never accounts for tax or tip or anything.  He takes it off the menu, and that's what he owes.  I had a sandwich.  Yeah, look, $4.95.  Here's my $4.95.  $4.95.  Cheap, zero, put in tax and tip.  But I normally agree with that, but when it comes to $200 worth of liquor, that's different, 
[01:29:00]  man.  But I agree with you normally.  If everybody's having comparable meals, fairly comparable.  All right.  You know something?  You don't get a calculator out.  Yeah, no, exactly.  You know something?  It was just funny, because going out with, you know, the old gang in Boston, that's  all I'll say.  I mean, it wasn't just one freaking espresso with Sambuca.  It was like five each with double shots.  Hey, Jay from Framingham used to pound him, too.  Hell yeah, he did.  And I do remember, a lot of times, you, we wouldn't let you pay for the booze bill, because 
[01:29:30]  it would be separate.  Sometimes.  You'd have the booze bill.  Dude, I'm not complaining.  And I do remember that.  I'm not complaining, but it was pretty funny.  I'm saying, because, I mean, I never saw people drink like you guys did.  I'll amend.  I'll make an amendment to what I say.  Dude, I was in a fraternity.  See, I've seen guys drink.  I've never seen people drink like you and your friends.  It was insane.  It's ridiculous.  It was insane.  It's like, how much alcohol can your liver process?  If there are a couple of people, or a few people in the party that are totally boozing 
[01:30:00]  it up, and others that are not drinking anything, and there's some kind of understanding there,  all right, divvy up the booze bill.  Whatever.  Take the booze bill.  And all this drinking would occur within a two-hour period, because the mother-in-law  would get so hammered, you'd have to drive it home.  We'd have to leave, yeah.  We'd have to go.  And I'm not talking about within the exact dollar.  If just the meals are comparable, we're all doing basically around the same thing, then  I would just do it.  I can't stand when people start going over the check.  All right, what did you have?  What did, okay, you had that $4.50, and then the tax, how many percent they're doing 
[01:30:30]  friggin' calculus on the table?  I cannot stand that.  Patrice is the worst, and I'm calling you out in front of 18 cities.  The worst with that.  Call him up.  You got his phone number?  Not with me.  I have it in the office.  Ben's saying somebody else is worse.  Earl.  Earl.  What do they have in common?  Stop it, black guys.  Cut it out.  That is a stereotype, too, that is very well known, is that black people do not tip very 
[01:31:00]  well.  Dude, I've dated waitresses, and they've said that.  It's like, you want to believe that.  That's not true, but my ex-girlfriend is a waitress.  They tip well if the restaurant accepts the food stamps?  Oh, god damn.  You know, that was bad.  I'm sorry.  I'm sorry, black people.  I was trying to be clever.  Jesus Christ, man.  It just sucked.  That was bad news.  Hope he goes right for the throat.  Yeah, they don't tip because they were slain.  What?  Where'd everyone go?  I didn't see that.  I know, I'm exaggerating.  I'm sorry.  Oh, man, people just checking in now.  That never works, Opie.  There's always, always somebody who shortchanges and makes everybody else eat the difference. 
[01:31:30]  And it's so true.  And you know what else pisses me off?  They never fess up to it.  I know.  It always goes around, and the one guy, who was you at the table, gets the check and  the money.  It's not enough, and everyone goes, well, I put it.  And if you listen to what everyone put in, you could buy the restaurant.  Look, it's always, I put in, oh, jeez, dude, dude, I had a salad, and I put in $50,000.  Look, I mean, you guys could have fun with me being cheap and stuff, but that's not what  this is about.  Because I didn't, like, I didn't push the issue.  I was just like, whoa, hey, we're a little short here. 
[01:32:00]  Like, hey, if you're a little short, 20 bucks, you need it.  Oh, yeah.  300 bucks.  300 bucks.  I'm like, whoa, Jesus, somebody, like, someone's trying to screw me.  And he's asking me for 20.  He's like, hey, dude, give me another 20.  And I'm like, but I just.  No, stop, dude.  And then Sandy.  Did you put in 80?  Yeah.  Stop.  Don't be a dick.  I did not say that.  And then Sandy's going, give him back the 20.  And he's like, I'm like, no, go ahead and keep it, because I'm thinking, well, you  know, I like being on the show.  You're such a dick.  Psycho Tim is on the line.  Here he is.  He is one of the guys that made a problem.  No, no, no, but I was going to finish the story, and I think it's pretty cool of Tim 
[01:32:30]  that he did this.  Go ahead, Tim.  Well, no, what I would say is, first of all, my girlfriend had a few too many cocktails.  So I was wondering, oh, again, I don't know.  Tim, we were talking, we love your girlfriend.  We were talking about her in the back room today.  She was so hammered after Norton's show that her eyes were spinning like slot machines.  Yeah.  Like backwards.  On his side.  Oh, my God.  So, no one took the initiative to say, hey, it's $400, and there's this amount of people  I don't know how much it is.  Dude, $500, $600. 
[01:33:00]  I just threw a $100 bill at a table.  No, no.  And you're safe, and I'll tell you why Tim is safe.  He had to get his girlfriend to bed, so he just got up and goes, guys, I got to go,  and threw a $100 down.  I'm thinking at the time, like, wow, okay, hey, that's very generous.  Yeah.  I was like, okay, cool.  But he was ordering.  The bottles of wine with $96 a bottle.  Thanks, Tim.  $96 a bottle of wine, is that what you were getting?  Well, I got this bottle that I like, and Anthony said that he didn't like it, so then I just  said, all right.  How drunk are you right now? 
[01:33:30]  Obie said he didn't like it, so he said, all right, then I just looked for the most expensive  one in the Cabernet.  I said about it.  We said this in the back of the office, too, because you bought, like, a bottle of wine.  It was like $30.  We were just like, hey, that's a good bottle of wine for a restaurant, you know?  And a couple of us didn't like it, and your girlfriend's giving the sign in the background,  ugh, he ordered that one?  Uh-oh.  So I go, yeah, yeah, Tim, it's not that great.  Most people that have a brain would just go, okay, I'll just go up one more on the wine  list.  No.  Tim went.  Right to the top.  Way up the top. 
[01:34:00]  Tim, you are guilty of this.  I'm not sure we've had 25 beers at Dorton Show.  So the next day, we're at the Rattlesnake on Boylston, and I'm still pitching, because  I'm like, Jesus, why did I have to spend $300 for appetizer and a glass of wine?  And Tim, he threw another $100 down on the table, but then I'm feeling guilty.  I'm like, I can't take $100.  But I took $60.  Gave him $40 back.  No, it was just fair.  I never lost it.  I never lost it.  I usually don't want to get screwed all the time. 
[01:34:30]  It's cool, but I think it's something that a lot of people can relate to, though.  Being the last guy in on the check.  I always throw in above and beyond.  I swear, I always throw in above.  If I had something that, like, you know, my dinner itself, just what I got, cost $25,  I'll throw in $100 to cover the food.  Dude, let it be said, and everyone says around the office, you have no problem spending money.  That is obvious.  You don't even have to have fun.  You don't even have to defend yourself. 
[01:35:00]  You don't have to defend yourself.  You have no problem.  Easy come, easy go, Alice.  I had it, and I went with it.  What about our friend Jay from Framingham?  Me a bag of shells.  Framingham's, now known as Jay from White Plains.  White Plains.  White Plains.  Moved down with us here.  And we never seen him.  And we never seen him.  But anyway, Jay's the other side of this.  He's the guy that, you know, goes out, you know, with a group of people.  Feels guilty.  I think he feels guilty that he's with us or whatever. 
[01:35:30]  So he'll have a beer and a burger and go, oh, guy's here, and put $100 down.  I'll put down $50, bud.  He literally overpays.  Good, then eat with him all the time.  That's the type of guy you need in your life.  It's a lot better than the one girl that would always go to the diner with us when I was growing up.  You know, the one, and this is, I'm not going to say her name, C.  And she would just, oh, gee, you're all eating, and she's just sitting there with that awful look.  I'm hungry.  Why don't you eat?  Oh, no, I don't have any money.  Oh, okay.  I don't mind you being manipulative. 
[01:36:00]  Just don't be bad at me.  Well, suck this for $20, and what the hell?  I never gave into it.  I'm like, really?  That sucks.  And I would just eat in a stupid face.  Someone is asking, how much did you tip?  Oh, we tipped 20%.  Yeah, 20%.  Most of it was wine.  Yeah, how much are you supposed to tip?  Who's calling up saying that's wrong?  You know what else sucks even worse?  This is when you're at a table with a group of people, and other people sit down and have a few drinks, and then just leave and don't throw any cash in.  Yeah, that's always good, too.  That happened to me on Saturday night, you know.  You know what?  That stuff happens. 
[01:36:30]  Like Ann said, if it's $300 here, $20 there, whatever.  But when it gets up to, wait a minute, I'm throwing in an extra $100, it's like, hello?  Hey.  I've thrown my amics down at a bar and just had a line of people that I know, and it's like, have fun.  And then it's always fun to check the number at the end of the night.  You're like, oh, Jesus Christ.  It's like the Bugs Bunny cartoon.  They're just going up to the box.  They're just going up to the box.  They're just going to put his credit card down.  Dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun beer.  Dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun booze.  Dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun wine.  Dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun.  They just keep filing past.  They're my friends. 
[01:37:00]  No, Anthony, if you're at a table with other people, at least contained on your check.  If you do at the bar, the whole bar can be drinking off you.  Thank you, Tim.  See you, guys.  All right, sweetie.  Adam Farrar checking in.  Adam Farrar from The Job on ABC Wednesday nights at 9.30.  Are you back tonight, Adam?  Yeah, we're back tonight.  Congrats, my pal.

Yeah, with the tally.  We've really got to break.  So hold on.  We'll talk to you right after the break, all right?  Okay.  All right.  Our buddy, our pal.  I can say that now.  Sure.

We're back with the Opie and Anthony show.  Hi.  Tell Kreskin this is in 1979 and Johnny Carson.  He's going to have to wait.  A couple phone numbers in the New York area.  877-692-1027.  Anywhere else outside of New York, you could use 866-2774. 
[01:39:30]  Wow.  Look at him.  He's jumping up and down outside the studio door, Anthony.  Yeah, I know.  Relax.  We'll get to you.  Yeah.  Adam Farrar from the job.  There you go.  Hi, guys.  On tonight, 930 on ABC.  Kreskin's there?  Again.  You know, I knew that.  Yeah.  I don't know.  He's got something that's going to thrill us.  Oh, yeah?  Yeah, something that's just so huge, you can't even describe. 
[01:40:00]  Better than sweetrelease?  Yeah, he said it's going to be newsworthy.  Yeah, yeah.  The whole world is going to talk about what he is doing,  what he has accomplished on this show today.  Okay.  And he's got something to do with Osama bin Laden.  Is that right?  Yeah.  The whole world will be talking.  Unless he's got his head in his hand as he walks in here whistling a happy tune.  Forget those daisy cutter bombs.  We need Kreskin.  Yeah, drop Kreskin.  They could shake their hands until their hands fall off. 
[01:40:30]  And by the way, can I just jump in?  Hey, Adam, it's Norton.  Hey, Bill, buddy.  Hey, how are you, man?  Good.  Off the subject.  Just to the girl who just left me a message.  I don't answer the goddamn phones, you sea sucker, so stop calling me with this crap.  I apologize.  Opie, there is an entire nother life going on for Jim Norton during commercials.  See, there's this show.  Now, in between the segments we do, when you're hearing commercials in your respective cities,  Opie was just in production throwing down some commercial lines, right? 
[01:41:00]  I was doing some lines for KX.  So, there you go.  I have to go in during the next commercial.  And I did my part of the hot wire, Ed.  Great.  I can't wait to put my part in.  A lot of people are going to think we did it at the same time in the studio, but no.  I record my part, then Anthony comes in later, does his part, then Steve puts it together  and make it sound like we're in the room together.  Sounds so natural.  The same way they did Ice Age.  Right.  Yeah, we did our Ice Age lines.  Sounds so natural.  Like we're in the same room. 
[01:41:30]  But I'm the voice of the beaver.  And I'm, you know, going over the instant feedbacks and whatnot, reading a few things,  looking at some pornography, whatever happens.  And Norton, on the other hand, he's living this life.  He's at the computer.  He's answering IMs and emails.  He's calling for furniture.  He's yelling at people, yelling at agents.  He's checking things.  And then he gets done and comes in, and it isn't enough that he writes messages and stuff on the computer. 
[01:42:00]  He's got to then put an exclamation point on the air.  What happened with this sea sucker?  Nothing to do with furniture and stuff.  You know, tell Opie and Anthony to stop hanging up on me every time I call.  What are you talking about?  I don't answer the phones.  That's awesome, Garrett.  And he does an awesome job.  Keep hanging up on her.  And there are times, I've got to tell people, that just live on the show while we're talking to Adam here,  I will just hang up on everyone because we need to clear the phone lines for other stuff. 
[01:42:30]  We can't be polite with the radio show.  If we hang up on you, take one for the team and realize we have to do that to keep the show moving along.  We've got to clear the field.  Some men are going to do some drinking.  Did we get this call?  Oh, look, I know you're on the air right now.  But Jim, you're the only one that brings a cell phone into the studio.  You see Anthony's cell phone?  I leave mine on my desk.  We leave all that crap in our office.  Exactly, exactly.  We come in here so we can concentrate for four hours. 
[01:43:00]  I got a call while I was on the air for someone telling me that I'm on the air.  Yeah, hey, you know, I hear you right now on the radio.  Great.  I have nowhere back there to leave my possessions.  It's in my coat in my pocket.  Oh, no, Jimmy needs a desk.  No, I don't.  I'm cool.  I'm very fine.  That's why I have my phone in here.  You could sublet a part of Opie's huge desk.  I hear he's subletting one of the plots.  I'm sorry to interrupt you, Adam.  What's the brother got to do get a cubby?  Really?  If I'm going to sublet my desk, though, there's going to be train tracks going down the middle of it. 
[01:43:30]  You could be on that side.  He's got a whole thing going on.  There's a joke in there somewhere.  I love it.  Emo Phillips said something.  Oh, wow.  It's going to be a whole week.  Emo Phillips would have said something witty there.  And it's not a glamorous life, believe me.  It's not like you're running around doing this.  No.  But the thing is, it's just this unpredictability.  Because when you come in here, when you come in here, he's in a good mood.  He's just Jim Norton having some fun. 
[01:44:00]  He'll go away for a commercial break.  Come back.  It is the most pissed off Norton you've ever seen.  Now he's pissed, Norton.  Then he comes out, he's just generally aggravated, Norton.  Anxiety ridden, Norton.  Notice how he's never in shape, hung, Norton.  So, Adam, the show is on tonight?  Yeah, the show's on tonight, Mr. In Shape Hung.  I saw you, dude.  I interrupted your sighted with my...  Hey, sir, you've got to get that out.  Adam, what was ABC thinking?  Throwing you guys off and then putting that crappy show on for four weeks. 
[01:44:30]  I have no idea.  Everyone knew it was going to blow.  I think even Dennis Leary told us that, you know, it's something they have to do for whatever reason.  What was it called?  Wednesdays, 9.30, 8.30 Central.  They didn't even have a name for it?  Nah.  It was on for two weeks, and they said, nah, we'll see you.  Yeah, that was a good thing to...  Now, why the hell would they do that?  I don't know.  You guys are on a roll, you got some heat, and then they pull you off to put that crap on.  And now we've got to get on the white horse and ride back in to get the ratings back.  Right.  Yeah.  Just ain't fair.  But you know what's cool? 
[01:45:00]  Next Wednesday, the whole cast is throwing out the first pitch at the Met game.  Oh, yeah?  Mm-hmm.  And I bet we throw better than they did.  Why don't you stay in for the whole game?  Hey, shut up.  Come on.  Will you get to meet the Metropolitans, Adam?  I guess so.  I don't know.  I just show up with my little glove like I'm going to play.  It's like the field trip.  Hey, Adam?  Yeah?  So what's on the job tonight?  Tonight, I think, is Frank is Gay, that episode.  We think Lenny Clark's character is gay. 
[01:45:30]  Oh.  And me and Dennis.  I think that's the episode tonight, so I think...  You think?  Yeah, it's either one of three, and that's the one I think it is.  And then what's the verdict here?  You're making new ones?  We don't know.  We're still waiting here.  We're still like...  What do we call?  Death Row.  Give me a number.  I'll call up the exec.  And what's the guy?  Marvin Kipman had an email campaign, and we flooded the emails to send them into ABC,  and I wrote one that said, don't do to them what you try to do to me, and I signed to  Ted Gobble.  Hey, when does Ed and I get our cameo? 
[01:46:00]  If we're on next season, you get a cameo.  Ah, there we go.  See?  You're kidding.  You're always pushing.  You're always pushing.  I got stickers going on.  I got bells going off.  Don't worry.  How could you not be on next season?  It's one of the hottest shows on television.  What is wrong with the networks?  I have no idea.  Great show, great cast.  Everybody likes it.  They're such stupid people.  The star of the Hospitaliano Olive Garden commercial.  Come on.  He's a great actor with Tony Danza good looks.  Adam's handsome.  Oh, did I tell you the Virgin Atlantic story? 
[01:46:30]  No, what?  I'm in Denver.  I walk into that Virgin Megastore in Denver.  I got a hat on my head.  I haven't shaved.  I walk up to the counter.  Incognito, Opie.  What?  You're incognito in disguise.  Yeah, yeah.  I'm just walking around, and the guy at the counter goes, hey, you're on that show.  You're on that cop show.  Will you sign on the wall?  And he gets on the loudspeaker.  Hey, the guy from the job is here.  People come over.  I got to sign everything.  Let me just ring you up, and I'm buying porn.  Oh.  Oh, nice.  That is the greatest thing I've ever heard. 
[01:47:00]  You're a hero.  You're a hero to those people.  Wow.  He's a hero unless it was gay porn.  Oh, yeah.  He's a hero.  I know.  Uncut Puerto Ricans 4 would have been my line.  I know.  We all know 3 sucked, and 4 was quite an improvement.  That's always a mess.  It was a war movie.  It was Dishonorable Discharge.  All right, Adam, I think we got to let you go, because Kreskin is having a hissy out there.  You know, if he was any good, he would have known this would happen.  Where are you?  I'm in L.A. 
[01:47:30]  Oh.  Oh, look at you.  What are you doing there?  I got to come out and do some things, but I'm coming back.  I got to come see you guys.  Oh, you have a couple of prospects, perhaps?  Yeah.  I'm on very strong avail for a Maytag commercial.  Great.  All right, Adam.  Good talking to you guys.  All right, there, pal.  Later.  Bye, Angel.  Bye, Jimmy.  I love Adam.  He says that in front of people that no one even knows.  Like, he'll just get in the elevator and go, hey, hot C, but he says the word.  Oh, yeah.  Hot Ock.  Oh, I hate you. 
[01:48:00]  I'm calling him sweetie in power.  He hates it.  Sweetie?  Well, duh.  Every guy would hate that.  Ben is in on the gag now, too, because we're at dinner last night, and he's talking about  Ben's luscious C. And not just for the table where we get a chuckle like we're a bunch of  retards like we are, you know? He says it loud enough where the table next to us, the  whole restaurant.  When he talks loud, when the elevator door shuts, and you're in there with other people,  and then he, out of nowhere, just starts going, yeah, so, you know, testing positive  isn't going to change my life, because I'm still just going to F whoever the hell I 
[01:48:30]  want.  Yeah.  I don't care.  And it's loud, and people are horrified.  He did that last night walking down 55th Street, and there were three women that just, I don't  even know how to describe their face. They were so horrified. He's like, yeah, I'm just  going to bang without a condom, even though I test the positive. Who cares? Wouldn't you?  Horrified.  He'll blurt those lines out. One time we were walking outside.  But that's all you hear, if you're the pastor.  Oh, because that's all he said. Yeah, right as they pass by, he'll blurt out something  like, you know, sometimes bitches just need a big punch in the face. And you're like, what? 
[01:49:00]  And you look at it, and the people are like, oh, my God, this man's disgusting.  But don't misinterpret. It's not to threaten the person walking by. I'm talking to my friend.  Right.  Like, they're catching a piece of the conversation.  They're catching a piece of the sick conversation.  In Boston, and in the lobby of the hotel we were staying at, I ran into him and Keith as they  were checking out. They are together about maybe five inches away from the receptionist's  face as they're checking out, describing in detail, very graphically, the sexual encounter  each of them had the night before. Her eyes are as wide as dinner plates just listening to 
[01:49:30]  this.  You don't understand what a dirtbag Keith is. He is the worst. I've seen him do this.  When people are talking, he will actually stand there and go, shut up. Shut up. He is really,  really an awful, obnoxious dude. He's the worst.  Yeah, but Patrice's...  Patrice's...  Patrice's... is horrible.  Yeah, yeah.  But Keith will actually go, shut up. For the love of God, shut it. 
[01:50:00]  Patrice will just stand there as someone's talking and just go, shh.  It's like, well, I'm carrying on a conversation. I'm just, what, what, what?  Well, not, Bobby. We're talking pretty low here. What the F is wrong with that guy?  Horrible.  Especially because he's just so big and awful. And they're like, who is this man?  He's big and frightening. And we all had to witness the, the, uh, the fart.  Who was a witness of the fart? You or Steve? And I, I know Amazing Garrett was.  Yeah, I think I was.  Who's Amazing Garrett?  I'm trying to change his name.  If you mix up Kreskin and Garrett again, that really bugs me. 
[01:50:30]  It's the Amazing Kreskin and Awesome Garrett.  I know Awesome Garrett doesn't like the name.  He does like the name.  I've been trying to push Amazing.  He's growing into it.  It fits him. He's awesome. And he knows he's awesome.  It's not a secret anymore.  Who doesn't look at that hair and want to give it a little flubber?  I just want to brush his hair and talk to him.  All right, let's get Kreskin in here.  Just to say hi, Anthony.  All right.  Just to say hi really fast.  Let's see what's going on here.  And then we'll make him wait another hour.  There he is.  He's got his American flag tie on. 
[01:51:00]  Look at him.  Ow.  No, I'm not shaking, Kreskin.  How are you doing, hot seat?  No, stop it.  Kreskin, fuck off.  Ow, get off of me.  Connie Hazel and this guy shakes his hair.  Look over here it comes.  Look at this here.  Ow.  You're making me shake like Michael J. Fox.  Cut it out.  Ben, shake Kreskin's hair.  Look at the nuts.  Look at Ben trying to shake back and I'm back. 
[01:51:30]  Take that big, what you see there, Kreskin.  Just grab a helmet and shake.  That's why I like it better.  Non-violent.  Kreskin, why do you wear makeup on the radio?  Because I'm doing a TV interview in a little while.  Oh, where are you going?  About this.  Oh, about this thing that you're doing.  No, you're not.  Kreskin.  Hey, guys.  I have been.  What the hell is going on in Boston?  Boston's not been the same since you left.  You lit up that town.  Oh, yeah.  They are.  Way to be with the times, Kreskin.  What a bunch of great, great people up in Boston.  We're waiting for the day that we can be back on the Boston Airwaves. 
[01:52:00]  It's going to happen soon.  Hey, you know what?  If you're out there when I'm there, I'll come on for the morning because I do a lot of engagements out there.  And I was at Boston University.  I love that.  Boston College.  That's one of the best colleges in business.  Oh, boy.  Yes.  Hey.  Yes.  Kreskin, you guys.  This could not be the best.  You've seen the news today.  Yes.  And I am going to be interviewed by the press about this.  They're all asking.  A drill press.  Hold on.  What press is interviewing you?  Bin Laden.  I will not use the word Bin Laden.  No, no.  Oh, oh.  No way.  I'm going to call him Bin Laden. 
[01:52:30]  Okay.  Why?  Pinhead.  Oh, dear.  Let me give you a wacky horn.  Hold it.  Thank you.  Can I use it again?  Pinhead.  Yes.  I will never use the term Bin Laden.  And we're going to send him our regards because the news tonight, beginning at noon today,  is is he still alive?  We don't know if he's still alive.  Yes.  Yes.  Let's, guys, find out.  I don't usually do things like this.  I'm not a blinding person.  Briefcase, Opie.  We're not going to rub him out.  Wait.  Are you doing the bin right now?  Yeah.  Can I?  He's working it. 
[01:53:00]  Here it comes.  This is going to give us worldwide fame.  Huh?  Wait to you.  Wait to you.  Wait to you see the story that's going.  What is he taking out of the briefcase?  Well, let's start with the rainbow.  I'm not a violent guy, so we're not going to kill Bin Laden.  We're not going to kill Bin Laden.  Yeah, why would you?  He hasn't done anything.  Why wouldn't we?  We're not going to murder him.  We're just going to rub him out.  Okay?  So he doesn't walk the face of the earth.  I'm going to do everything I can to do.  Put him in space?  You guys at home, if you don't have a doll, or if you're in a car, if you don't have a doll,  just take out a sheet of paper. 
[01:53:30]  And Opie and Anthony, have a sheet of paper in front of you.  A blank sheet of paper.  A blank sheet.  I don't have one, sir.  Do I need a pencil or pen, Creskin?  Somebody immediately get me a pen.  Can I have one so I can play along with you?  Creskin, do you?  Please?  Please?  Don't throw it.  Don't throw it.  That's all right.  Okay.  Now listen.  This is the...  You think I enjoy getting you?  It's a pen lot.  All right.  Hold it, Creskin.  I need a pen.  This is like school.  I was never prepared, Opie.  No, it's not school.  I never had my pen or paper. 
[01:54:00]  What am I supposed to write with?  Clear stuff?  You're not going to write anything.  Okay.  You're not going to write anything.  Creskin, I have a pen, and I have a blank sheet.  Is it okay if something's on the other side of the sheet of paper?  That's okay.  Okay, Creskin.  I'm checking with Creskin, Opie.  I want you...  No, you know what?  Oh, you're playing along, too, Garrett.  He's got some type of a doll.  Now, Creskin, this is radio.  We've got to explain what's going on.  There's a doll here.  Yes.  And I don't believe in voodooism, but voodooism does work in New Orleans and in certain parts  of the islands if people believe in it. 
[01:54:30]  If you believe that a curse has been placed on you, you tend to react.  And in Haiti and in New Orleans, the people who believe their curse stop eating and solely  starve to death.  God forbid that he hits the bucket by starving to death.  Hold this.  But the voodoo doll doesn't look like Pin Laden.  Tell him who's holding it and everything.  You've got to just...  I don't want to say that.  Rick, Rick, right now is holding this voodoo-type doll.  All right.  Is that supposed to represent Pin Laden? 
[01:55:00]  Yes, it is.  Yes, it is.  Now, you want to get a close-up of the doll.  Turn it over, Rick, so the camera can show what's on it.  Take a shot of what's on it.  He's misdirecting the guy with the camera.  No, no.  Oh, Steve.  I'm going to get it.  Play along.  Look at the writing on it.  Don't take it.  You see, there's writing all over it, right?  Now, you're going to give that to Opie, and Opie's going to start to read some of the  details of the different areas.  Uh-huh.  But guys at home...  No, I'm not.  Yes, you are, Opie.  Yes, you are, Opie.  Play along with Kreskin.  He's a legend.  Everybody at home, if you've got a sheet of paper, and maybe, Anthony, you can describe 
[01:55:30]  what they should draw.  They don't have to fill in the dark part.  But fill in a figure.  What do I have?  The outline of a figure like this.  Okay.  I don't have to fill in.  They should draw the outline.  Just describe, Anthony.  It looks like a silhouette of a man standing up.  No features.  No features.  It's black.  That's called a silhouette.  Yeah.  Now...  Kreskin, no features.  That's why I use the term silhouette.  Featureless.  See?  Yeah, I never thought of this as a high cultural show, but that's all right.  We'll keep that advice.  Now, when you draw it, draw the head. 
[01:56:00]  Make sure you've got the hands.  You've got both arms.  Yes.  Make sure you've got both feet, but those both legs, and make sure you've got a waist.  Kreskin, can you draw a mule on it?  No, no, no, no, no.  No mule.  It's a silhouette, Opie.  Now, I am drawing this.  Do I have to fill it in with it?  No.  No, guys, don't fill it in.  Let me do it.  I'm drawing...  Oh, no.  Here he comes.  Yes.  A pencil.  The, um...  I don't have a pencil.  I got a pen.  Well, put the initials on the back.  Look at the shoulders.  Wait, I want to make sure it's the same card.  Hey, turn that over.  No, I want you to put the...  I'll show you the...  No trickery.  No, put the initials there for now.  He won't let me see the card. 
[01:56:30]  No, I'll show you what.  And...  Hold it.  I'm drawing.  All right.  Now, you got to...  You got both initials there?  Yeah.  That's how I do it.  It needs to be dark enough, guys.  All right.  Here's what I want to do.  Okay.  You hold it.  When you hold the doll, when he holds the doll, you've got to hold it facing you.  All right.  Don't hold it.  Hold it.  You've got the...  Who's got the doll?  I got the doll.  Nice drawing, Norton.  You've got to be facing you.  Jesus Christ.  Anthony...  It looks like a starfish with a mongoloidism.  You've got to make sure...  Pass this over to...  Pass this over to mine.  That's the answer.  Woo-hoo.  All right.  That's right.  Okay.  Now, Anthony...  No, it just gave him a little tickle at his time. 
[01:57:00]  Guys, wait a minute.  Yes, Creskin, yes.  You've got to have it facing you.  Creskin, no one knows what's going on here.  Have the figure of the doll facing you.  You folks at home that have drawn a figure on a sheet of paper, you've got to look at the  figure, the outline of the figure, as if it's facing you.  Okay.  So, now, you have your piece of paper at home.  Let me update everybody.  You have your piece of paper at home.  You're drawing a silhouette, just an outline, no features, of a man standing.  Are we drawing a facade of Pinlottis?  Yes, it is just a facade. 
[01:57:30]  Just a figure.  And I am now...  All right.  Now, I am now holding the voodoo-type doll, which has all types of writing on it.  It looks to me to be some type of acupuncture doll.  It's got things written on it where it says heartburn.  You poke him in the head.  What's it say there?  In the head, it says headache, sinus.  If you poke him between the legs, should we say, the crotch...  Right.  It says jock itch. 
[01:58:00]  All right.  And irregularity.  I guess this is what cures these problems.  It's not going to cure him.  Okay.  He's going to get to maximum...  All right.  Now, guys, I'm going to place the silhouette that I have on the sheet of glass.  I'm going to put it on just a couple little canisters that are elevated off here because  I don't want to touch it anymore.  Now, Kreskin has two sheets of glass, let me say this, and he is putting his drawing  between the two sheets of glass that are about one foot by one foot and elevating them  on some type of little... 
[01:58:30]  Anthony, legs.  Yes.  Yes, I'll be, yes.  Spread this out here.  Why couldn't Hollywood Squares say yes?  So he can lay it right there.  I don't know.  We stuck with this.  Now, you've got a needle.  Anthony, do you have a needle in your hand?  No, I do not.  Oh, here is the needle, Kreskin.  Thank you, buddy.  Guys at home, if you're sitting in a car, by the way, just pull over to the side.  Use a pencil as a needle.  Use a pencil as a needle.  Pencil as a needle.  Now, you've got in front of you.  Yes.  Everybody has in front of you.  I've got one car here that's a blank, which is not going to help.  Kreskin now pulling out some cards about the size of index cards. 
[01:59:00]  Look at this.  Guys, if you get this, by the way, look at it.  See where the marks are.  There's a mark on the shoulder there.  A mark on what?  Stomach?  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  They are various cards about...  On what?  About 8 by 10 with the same silhouette of a man, but the difference with these cards are  there are X's on various parts of the body.  I'm trying to describe for the people at home, Kreskin.  All right.  Tell...  Let's say who's holding these cards now.  Kreskin.  Oh, he's handing them to somebody.  Who? 
[01:59:30]  The amazing...  Kreskin is handing them to Awesome Garrett.  Now, Garrett, why don't you stand over here?  Stand over there, Awesome Garrett.  It's Awesome Garrett.  Let's say Garrett over here.  Just cut the cards first.  Hold them down.  Cut the cards.  Cut...  He's cutting this deck of...  You can use your fingers just to thumb them off.  Cut them, sweetie.  Keep them down.  Cut them...  Put them on the table.  Put them on the table.  Cut them as many times as you want.  He's selling it off.  Just cut them.  Cut them as many times as you want.  Awesome Garrett is not cutting so awesomely.  No, he's not.  Not...  Now, let me ask you this.  You got him face...  Jesus.  There you go.  Do it again.  I mean, you look like you're so skillful.  You do it one more time. 
[02:00:00]  Give him another cut.  Of course.  I never saw it.  Put them on the right card.  Keep them down.  No, no, no.  Keep them down.  No, stop it.  All right.  Let's do it.  Take the card, Garrett, behind me.  Just take the card off the top behind me.  Just take it off behind me.  Now, let me ask you.  Don't the camera show it yet?  Yes.  Is there a mark on one part of the body?  Yes or no?  Yes.  Go over to Anthony.  Yes.  Now, Anthony, don't say anything.  I won't say a word, Creskin.  I want you, and the listeners at home, you've got this figure in front of you, whether it's  a real doll or a silhouette on paper, and, Garrett, you show Anthony where the mark is 
[02:00:30]  on the card, but, Anthony, don't say anything to the listeners.  I am not saying the word, Creskin, and I have looked at the mark.  Have you given the card?  Did you give it to him, Garrett?  Yes.  He has, I have looked at it, Creskin.  He has not given it to me.  All right.  Look at it.  I have looked at it.  All right.  Now, listen at home, folks.  You've got in front of you a silhouette.  You've got, now let me tell you the possible positions.  It could be head.  It could be the right shoulder, the left shoulder, the right arm, left arm.  It could be the stomach.  It could be the neck.  It could be the heart or the right chest.  It could be the right ankle, left ankle. 
[02:01:00]  It could be the knee, right knee.  You've got it focused, which it is.  Don't tell me.  You've got it focused, which it is now?  Yes.  Very focused, Creskin.  It's facing you, right?  Yes.  The press is going to be reporting this.  You've got it facing you?  Yes.  Oh, yes, Creskin.  You've got the doll facing you the same way?  Absolutely.  All right.  When I count to three.  Yes.  When I count to three, I want you to insert the needle in the same place as the silhouette  has the X.  And you folks at home, insert it where you want to. 
[02:01:30]  One, two, three, now.  Keith!  Creskin just fell down on the floor.  Creskin, are you okay?  Yes, he might be having that stroke on the floor.  Hold on, hold on.  What happened, Creskin?  Creskin fell down on the floor.  It looks like, it looks like Kirk Douglas.  Do you have the, uh...  Yes.  Yes, Creskin.  Do you have the needle in one of the legs?  Creskin, I do indeed have the needle in one of the legs.  Face, is it the right leg?  Creskin, it would be the right leg. 
[02:02:00]  Face to you.  I don't want to touch the glass up there.  I want you to take...  Opie, I want you to come over here.  Opie, run over there.  I'm going to believe this.  Come over here.  I will not be a part of it.  All right, then you do it.  Then you do it.  Put the glove on.  Put the glove on.  Put the glove on, Rick.  Is there cancer in it?  Put the glove on.  Wait, awesome, Gary wants to do it.  No, Rick will do it.  He's got...  I don't want anyone to get hurt by flying glass.  I will be flying.  When you break the glass, don't hit it too hard.  Just close your eyes.  I want you to break the glass.  Why are you breaking the glass? 
[02:02:30]  Because the glass has the thing between it.  Wow.  Yeah, right.  All right, listen.  Drop something.  Where?  Can I see the doll?  Yes, Creskin.  You guys, Opie, anything.  If I can bring the doll over to Creskin, it would be my honor.  Listen, guys.  If I can open anything, you'll agree that I've never touched that since we put it in there.  Yes.  It is in the...  There is the...  Reach over with the glove.  Reach over with the...  Because we want to rub this guy out.  We want to rub him out.  Turn on the shoulder to them.  I don't want to touch it.  Oh, my God.  The leg is missing. 
[02:03:00]  The foot is missing.  Is that wild?  Is that wild?  Is that wild?  The same foot.  That's why I wanted you folks to know that nothing was damaged, nothing was touched.  Had you picked the head, had you picked the leg, whatever part, we would have rubbed it  out.  And I'm going to tell you something at home, guys.  And all the followers of Pin Laden, if I had my way, the needle's here.  Yes, sir.  But as I'm going to mention tonight, Pin Laden is more than a pain in the ass.  In fact, right now, I think he has a pain in the ass. 
[02:03:30]  Oh, he just put the needle in the ass of...  That wild?  Kreskin, I am again amazed...  What happened?  ...by the amazing Kreskin.  That was good.  Well, what's amazing about it?  Well, Opie, there was a card between the two pieces of glass.  No, I missed something somewhere.  Yes, you did, Opie.  And when...  It was like the...  My promise was to rub him out.  Why did we draw?  In that wild, and we had rubbed him out.  You need to see...  Guys, he looks like he has a sprained ankle. 
[02:04:00]  Kreskin...  Hey...  What's the matter, Rick?  That freaks me out.  That freaks me out.  Now, Rick, what did that card look like when it was placed...  It was a shadow card.  It was an actual shadow card.  And by the way...  Well, I'm not even freaked out about that.  That's not even what's freaking me out.  It's because while he was setting this up, I'm looking at my stupid drawing that I did.  Yeah.  And I'm like...  I'm like, before I even suggest anything, I know where I'm going to put my mark.  You put it...  And some people...  And I knew exactly where it was.  And some of the people listening in.  It's the card damn same thing.  So do the people listening in.  Oh, my gosh.  So do the folks listening in. 
[02:04:30]  Before he even started, I was like...  Right, Hank.  Rick.  Guys, you want to know...  I'm stealing the power of the amazing president.  Guys, we're going to win this damn war.  First of all...  Here he goes.  A group like you guys, we're showing our enemy a side of us that they don't even understand.  Now you're going to be interviewed by the press?  Well, I'm going downstairs to some photographers.  Seriously, I'm not joking.  Hey, guys.  I was saying this for you guys.  All right, go downstairs.  I thought we'd have a wild time.  Go downstairs and...  Preskin, thank you so much.  Another handshake.  Ow! 
[02:05:00]  Ow!  All right, Preskin.  Good job.  Rick, go downstairs with a phone so we could be there when the photographers and the news crews interview  Kreskin because of his amazing...  There he goes.  His amazing...  Ow!  Doesn't that hurt?  Oh, then he beats you up a little bit?  Because he's giving me back because he knows I'm such a dick to him.  Thank you, Kreskin.  Thank you.  Pleasure.  Once again, I am amazed by the amazing Kreskin.  Rick, go downstairs because he says the reporters are waiting for him.  Oh, now they're at another location. 
[02:05:30]  Well, you never know, right?  All right.  Okay, I don't know what just happened, but...  Kreskin, the amazing Kreskin.  Well, Rick says it was amazing, so...  You know, we said we were going to rub him out, and if you think about it...  And, of course, look at that.  The symbolism is there.  We did rub him out.  His foot has been rubbed out.  I honestly thought, by the way, you were...  You were...  The fellow was here before, was thinking initially of the head, and I'll bet you that was the idea.  Weren't you thinking at first of the head?  No!  You actually got it immediately?  Before you even start...  Look at Rick.  Awesome, Garrett was flipping those cards. 
[02:06:00]  Rick's getting all taken by it.  Rick, you're amazing yourself.  Stop.  By the way, guys, be careful.  I don't complain how it works when he leaves.  There's broken glasses.  There's guys out...  Explain it now.  Oh, stop it.  You just happened to pick the same body part he did.  Oh, come on.  It's a math equation.  What a skeptic.  I guarantee there's people in this room that picked the head.  That's right.  You're absolutely right.  He's a skeptic, Kreskin, and I want to apologize for Opie, because I understand the amazingness  of the amazing Kreskin, and the awesomeness of awesome Garrett.  Yes.  Well, I'm not this awesome Garrett. 
[02:06:30]  Oh, yes, Ozzy's here.  Oh, yeah.  I want to investigate...  Yeah, I talked to Ozzy.  I want to investigate awesome Garrett.  I just want to know what his background is and what his thinking is, because I've been  trying to read his thoughts all night.  Kreskin, all you need to know is he's awesome.  I'm not awesome Garrett.  I'm not awesome Garrett.  This guy's one of the comedy finds in the business.  Yes.  Well, you know who his father is, right?  He is one of the best comedians in the business.  Who's his father there, Kreskin?  Come on, tell everybody.  You don't know I'm not helping you.  There you go.  Oh, for the new cities.  Mr. Mean.  Don Rickles. 
[02:07:00]  Don Rickles.  Very good.  You probably were on the Johnny Carson show together a few times in the day.  88 Carson shows, yes.  We did.  Hey, guys, take care.  That's a lot of Kreskin.  Kreskin, thank you so very much.  Don't talk to the reporters.  We'll see you again.  No, you already shook my hand.  Thank you, sir.  Take care, Kreskin.  Watch the door.  Wait, you forgot something.  There he goes.  You totally nailed him.  And there he goes.  Opie, I...  You see his assistant?  I'd like to make my mule disappear into her mouth.  I have one question.  That's all.  Just one quick question. 
[02:07:30]  What the hell just happened?  I have no idea, but I can't believe how colorful Rick is.  Rick is a complete idiot.  Dude, I totally picked that part.  Basically, I guess we had to make some kind of figure, and then we had to figure out what  body part he was going to rub out, right?  Yeah.  And I guess at home, you had to choose what body part you wanted him to stick the pin in,  I guess.  Now that he's gone, can I just explain to people that he put a card, picture a red 8 by, what 
[02:08:00]  is that, those little index cards?  Index card.  Index card size.  It was red.  It had a silhouette of a man standing up on the card.  He put that between two pieces of glass and put it on the table and never touched it again.  Uh, when Stinky picked the card that had an X on one of the feet, I put the pin in one  of the feet of the little doll.  That's when he fell down?  That's when he fell down.  That's when I thought he was doing that stroke thing that we were hoping for earlier. 
[02:08:30]  Oh, man.  Imagine that.  Ratings boost.  I was like, holy mackerel.  I should go on tour as an amazing guy.  I predicted stroke, and here he is having stroke.  He asked Rick to break the glass now that had the card between it.  When Rick broke the glass, Kreskin still didn't touch it.  Rick picked it up with his hand.  Flipped it over.  Flipped it over, and it was the same red card with the same silhouette.  The only difference, the foot.  Was missing.  That I had put the pin in.  Because he rubbed out.  Was missing.  Pin Laden.  Right.  It was a good trick, Tom.  Now, you can figure out how that one was done. 
[02:09:00]  I think I know, but.  How?  I think you said it.  Magic.  No, it's a slight of hand trick.  No, I don't think so.  Well, yeah, it might be.  So, you're saying that the card that he put there.  But, that was based on.  Stop, Garrett.  You know, who cares?  You get so annoyed at this.  I hate this, Tom.  Look at him, he's cutting it short.  I want to ponder for a minute or two.  What a curmudgeon.  I know, I want to ponder.  Now, was it put between the two pieces of glass before you picked the card? 
[02:09:30]  Okay.  So, it was up to you now to pick the card with the X on the foot.  I guess.  There it is.  You did it, didn't you?  Awesomely.  Awesomely.  There's a lot of cards with the same foot picture missing.  Yeah.  And all he had to do was get rid of the two where he showed you the head was missing.  The other, now, Garrett is picking, obviously, the card he needs him to pick.  How?  What happened to you?  Garrett was cutting the cards.  Apparently, this card tried to escape.  It was going to cut its foot off so it would never run again. 
[02:10:00]  It's an old card trick.  Just jazzed up.  Right.  All right.  We don't have to sit and ponder.  No, please.  Much longer.  Ozzy's here.  I know.  We want to talk to Ozzy.  You know what?  Yeah.  Ah.  That's low.  I hate Kreskin.  I like Kreskin.  Kreskin is now going to talk to a reporter.  There's a big press conference somewhere.  I'd love to be there.  He said it was outside, and then we said, okay, we'll go outside with you, and then he  goes, well, they might be somewhere else. 
[02:10:30]  Wow.  Rick, stop.  Don't joke.  Oh, God.  I made a mental decision before he did anything of where I would put that damn thing.  Who cares?  Yeah, and what are the odds?  But you put it there.  What are the odds?  And then it was there.  There was the head, the chest, the arms, or the legs.  No, he said the leg, the ankle, the stomach.  Oh, stop it.  Get a hold of yourself, you well-muscled Spaniard.  Vic, checking in now.  Look at what he says.  This just in.  I guess it's true. 
[02:11:00]  Well, Osama bin Laden has a sprained ankle.  Exactly.  And it says AP, so it's got to be true.  Thanks, Kreskin.  The guy kills thousands of people, and you're able to give him a sprained ankle.  You give him a sprained ankle.  Put an ace bandage on him.  How about one to the back of his head, you idiot?  Why did Kreskin fall down?  And why couldn't we stab the doll in the mouth that shut Kreskin up?  Hey, Ope.  Why did he fall down when I stuck him in the ankle if it was the bin Laden doll?  Right.  I don't know.  I don't understand.  It was a diversion of some sort, perhaps.  Maybe to look at his assistant who was standing right outside the door who can signal what 
[02:11:30]  part had been pointed to.  It don't matter, though.  It doesn't matter.  So the cards are set in the middle of the glass.  The trick was set up.  The second he put that in the glass, everything would have been predetermined.  Yeah, you're right.  Maybe it's just for effect, then.  A lot of those things...  Who cares?  I hate this!  We're not going to waste another hour on a stupid card trick!  Holy S!  You're right.  You're right.  You're right.  My apologies.  You just exploded.  Rick, and the odds are you were going to pick the same body part. 
[02:12:00]  Yeah.  So what?  Yeah.  Rick was standing there like he just saw Jesus Christ.  I could say, pick a number from one to five to everyone in the room, okay?  And I could say, well, the number was three.  All of a sudden, it goes, oh, my God!  Oh, my God!  That's the number I picked!  Right, right.  But everyone else in the room picked another number.  Dude, but what I'm saying, what are the chances that I made that...  It doesn't matter.  Seven or eight to one.  I had by myself without seeing anything.  The chances are...  Seven or eight to one. 
[02:12:30]  The chances are there was five body parts.  That's good.  That's good chances.  20%.  20%.  Whatever.  10, 10, 10%.  Even 10.  Ten to one horses come in.  I picked stomach.  I guessed stomach.  All right, Rick.  Yeah.  Give that hammer trussle straight and I'm right now.  All right.  Then explain it, Ope.  Explain to me how he got it there.  Explain it.  Well, we don't know that.  And again, I'm going to take my headphones off.  I'm going to take my headphones off of this one.  It's a stupid variation on card tricks.  But then explain it.  It was slide of hand.  Slide of hand.  He knows that he needs Garrett, awesome Garrett, to pick the car that 
[02:13:00]  is missing, that has the X in the foot.  Right.  That's where the whole trick comes from.  That's the whole trick.  Right there.  He has the missing foot card somewhere.  No matter how many times awesome Garrett awesomely cut that deck, he would still do an awesome  pick of the X on the foot.  Still talking about the trick.  Oh, my God.  All right, Rick.  Rick, I'll go with your way of thinking.  The guy is awesomely magical. 
[02:13:30]  Right.  I didn't say he was magical.  He's very magical.  I'm just wondering, since you know how he did it, Hack.  Frank, you can't curse, Sophie.  Hold on.  How did he do it?  He's a freak.  I'll tell you what happened.  He's a magician.  I'll tell you what happened.  Being picked for that trick tapped into Rick's one time when he wasn't picked for the magic  trick as a lad, and when you put that glove on, you just felt special and like you were  a part of it.  Glove on his hand, glove on his mule, being uncut and all.  Breaking that glass, everybody looking. 
[02:14:00]  It's years of...  I'm helping.  It's years of practice, Rick.  I go to a stupid restaurant hunting, a guy does card tricks.  Right.  Same principle.  Same principle.  Rick, if you say you know how he did it, tell me how he did it.  But that's it.  I'll tell you what would be amazing.  If you cracked that glass and he pulled out a picture of me getting a Hummer from a  guy in a dress, that would be miraculous.  But how did he do it? 
[02:14:30]  See, the thing is, Rick, we know how he did it.  All right, Rick, he brainwashed you.  We know how he did it.  He did it with a card trick.  It's a card trick.  But I can't give you details of how that trick is done, but it's a card trick.  He shuffles a deck, and all of a sudden, right at the moment of truth, when awesome Garrett  has to awesomely pick the card, he puts that X'd out ankle card somewhere where Garrett's  going to pick it.  That's it.  That's all there is to it. 
[02:15:00]  Under the glass, already, he'd already done some mumbo jumbo where the foot missing card  is percolating over here.  I, the F, this stupid fraud gets us every time.  Now, another hour discussing Kreskin.  No, no, okay.  I'm done.  He should have retired when Carson did.  I'm satisfied.  Did you just say mumbo jumbo?  I said mumbo jumbo.  I said, Todd from Buffalo, don't you love it when Opie freaks out and then Norton gets 
[02:15:30]  all passive and quiet, and then he writes, stop it!  And then in the close, no, no, you're right, you're right.  Can we play the Wesley Willis song of the day?  Maybe save this segment of awful radio?  All righty.  Turn on CNN.  Let's watch the press conference.  The press is going to be all over that. 
[02:16:00]  Oh, my God.  He's probably being interviewed by some college student.  Why have you not hung yourself?  The Middle East is ready to roll into World War III, but that's going to be on the news.  Yes.  They're going to preempt any war news for Kreskin and his doll.  The 75-year-old magician does trick.  And I don't appreciate the fact that he turned an event that killed 2,000 people into a cute  little card trick on our goddamn show. 
[02:16:30]  Yeah.  He'd get press on that if instead of a doll, he was using an underage girl.  Hey, where's the...  Now, that would get him some press.  I'm putting a pin in you.  Wouldn't it be funny if he opened the thing...  Oh, here it is.  Yeah, and it was like a guy in a cape with an X below the back.  All right.  Because it fell off the horse card.  And then the lowest lane card was cracked out, hiding behind a bush. 
[02:17:00]  That whore Margot kidder.  I'd love to eat her cookus.  We're up to 40 minutes discussing Kreskin.  The original Superman card has a hole in its head.  I don't know what comedian did it, but someone said that the original Superman shot himself  faster than a speeding bullet?  Guess not.  And I don't know what comedian it was, but man, I laughed when I heard that. 
[02:17:30]  Well, now it's yours.  His name was George Reeve, right?  Yes.  Ironically, Christopher Reeve.  Yes.  Tragic, both of them.  Both problems.  Yeah.  All right.  I guess we're done with the trick, everybody.  Yeah.  Yeah.  All right.  Well...  I want to hear Wesley Willis.  Shut up, Rick.  Shut up, Rick.  You're a rube.  You're one of those goddamn rubes that believe that stuff.  Go play some three-card money out on the street.  Win some money.  Why don't you ask how Wesley Willis did it?  A homeless person with an instrument.  What Wesley Willis song are we playing today? 
[02:18:00]  Oh, I think we're going for O.J. today, right?  Oh, yeah.  His O.J. song.  You never played Chronic Schizophrenia from yesterday?  O.J. does the same trick as Kreskin, only he takes the heads off of real people.  It's amazing.  Then he comes up with a cute little name.  Oh, I can't call him Bin Laden.  I've got to call him Pin Laden.  Why Pin Laden?  I guess that's his way of justifying the fact that he's making a trick out of a tragedy.  It's not really Bin Laden.  I'm rubbing him out. 
[02:18:30]  What?  He's Harry Hack.  Oh, God.  That kind of annoyed me, too.  I felt kind of self-righteous.  I didn't really know that right with the little Bin Laden reference.  I feel bad for the guy because he comes in here, it's radio, and he's got, like, makeup on,  and he's probably hoping that the press are going to show up.  No one's showing up.  I don't feel bad.  Go home and wipe off your clown makeup.  Oh, God.  Oh, my God.  No one's showing up.  There's no press showing up for your doll act.  Like Peter Brady looking for a surprise party. 
[02:19:00]  Just as disappointed.  Yeah, just as hot in those little slacks.  Maybe his family will throw him on a little press conference.  Hey, you got a surprise when your dad died of AIDS, didn't you, Peter?  And how many there was a party in his backside?  Look at him.  Jim loves himself.  He's proud of himself.  That one made me really laugh.  That's very funny.  Party in his backside.  And how big do your eyeglasses have to be? 
[02:19:30]  Oh, my God.  How much attention does one person need?  Somewhere between Harry Carey and Freddie Laker.  Had enough of those glass toboggans he wears on his face.  Love to rub my helmet on them.  That'd teach him.  When he said break the glass, you should have put the hammer into his face.  Now, that's a good trick, Rick.  Break the glass.  Crash.  Ow.  Look, he's on the floor again.  Oh.  How fun.  Steve, please tell me you got video of Kreskin falling over looking like he had a stroke. 
[02:20:00]  I got great video.  All right.  It'll be up on Foundry Music.  I don't.  Don't you.  Ah.  I hate this.  All right.  Don't put the stupid trick up on foundrymusic.com.  I'm not spending all night downloading another stupid Kreskin effing trick so I can figure  out how he did it.  He will.  All I want on foundrymusic.com is Kreskin looking like he had a stroke.  That's all I want to see.  Aren't you curious?  No.  I'm not going to try.  Hey, wait. 
[02:20:30]  Rewind it.  Rewind it.  What is he doing with his left hand?  I don't care.  Just the clip should be 10 seconds.  Kreskin.  And just say, Kreskin having a stroke.  Don't say fake stroke.  Don't say fake stroke.  Just say he's having a stroke.  Wesley Willis.  Wesley Willis.  With another stupid song that sounds like every other song he does.  Well, he really did drop like head of Nussbaum though, didn't he?  Here comes the amazing Kreskin. 
[02:21:00]  He does contracts and no one can figure them out.  But it's got to be a contract because Kreskin isn't magic.  Kreskin isn't magic.  Kreskin isn't magic.  Kreskin isn't magic.  Kreskin isn't magic.  Ope gets all upset when Kreskin does his tricks.  Because he cannot figure out how he does it.  But he knows it's just a trick.  It's got to be a trick.  Because Kreskin cannot do magic.  Only the Lord does magic.  Kreskin can't do magic. 
[02:21:30]  Kreskin can't do magic.  Kreskin can't do magic.  Kreskin can't do magic.  Kreskin can't do magic.  I hate Kreskin.  I can never figure out what he does.  And I don't even care.  Stop with the tricks already.  Stop with the tricks already.  That's changing his format because he never changes the chorus.  You forgot to rock on London.  Rock over London.  Rock on Chicago.  Rock on Kreskin's head.  If we're lucky.  Does the OJ song sound exactly like all the others?  Oh yeah. 
[02:22:00]  The Wesley Willis song of the day.  This is called OJ.  OJ Simpson murdered Nicole Simpson and Ronald Goldman.  He stabbed both of them to death of a machete.  He was arrested on two state murder charges.  OJ Simpson was taken to jail.  OJ Simpson.  OJ Simpson.  OJ Simpson. 
[02:22:30]  OJ Simpson.  OJ Simpson.  OJ Simpson surrendered work at 11 a.m.  He was arrested by the Los Angeles Police Department at 9 o'clock p.m.  Outside the walls of Simpson's estate.  Members of OJ Simpson's family hugged each other.  They cried after word of the arrest came out.  OJ Simpson.  OJ Simpson.  OJ Simpson. 
[02:23:00]  OJ Simpson.  Wow  Oh, the musical interlude there in the middle  A football play  O.J. Simpson was a no-good jerk  He is a big-ass wolf  He had no business killing his ex-wife, Nicole  And her friend, Ronald Goldman 
[02:23:30]  O.J. Simpson played on the naked gun and roots  But answer now  He is a heightened criminal  Criminal  O.J. Simpson  Rock and roll, McDonald's  O.J. Simpson  O.J. Simpson  Rock over like that  Rock on Chicago  That's Dave Snooks, Johnny  Stay with me  There you have it, Wesley Willis 
[02:24:00]  That guy with that instant feedback  Yes, I was sitting there with my arms folded, sighing loudly when Kreskin was trying to do his thing  Yeah, Tuttle  He hates me, I love it  Tuttle does?  No, Kreskin  Kreskin  So he just doesn't understand why I don't play along  And a lot of people are saying  Boy, you really are trying to throw us from the loop  Because Kreskin was the 520 bet  O.J. and Anthony 
[02:24:30]  And on the eighth day, God said  Let there be breath  Boom  And we're back with the O.P. and Anthony show  Yeah  There's a bunch of drunk people outside the studio today  Yeah, what happened there?  Going through all our Sam Adams  By the way, I think our morning guy had a nervous breakdown  Yeah, what happened with Pharrell here in New York?  Scott Pharrell does mornings here, yeah, in New York 
[02:25:00]  And, uh, I don't know, I think he had an episode, he hasn't been on the air since  And he doesn't want to talk about it with his pals O.P. and Anthony  Why not?  I'm hearing rumors he's gonna go see doctors and stuff  What?  Because he wasn't on, he left the show, I believe in midstream  When? Yesterday?  Two days ago  Two days ago?  Oh wait, maybe yesterday, yeah  Yesterday, and then today he was not on  He was in best of mode  Remember, I said he would blow up April 4th 
[02:25:30]  You said April 4th, O.P., it is now, uh, well, it was the, uh, 9th yesterday, so  I was close  Very close, within five days  Not bad  How did you do that?  I believe it was a card trick  No?  Sorry  Wow, that kind of, uh, you know, a lot of people are talking about the guy  You know, he's got a little buzz going for himself  And, and what, did he lose his mind?  What happened?  What are we looking at?  We really don't know, and I, I, I would love to know, and, uh, pass it along to his fans, man 
[02:26:00]  People are definitely concerned, um, all kidding aside, I hope he feels better  We love the guy  We want him to succeed here in New York, and, uh, I guess we'll have to wait and see  That's all I know  If anyone should have lost their mind, it was, uh, Mason and Kalinsky  You know, at least he has some kind of buzz going  Maybe all the other sports guys  That were on before him  Jesus  So we got drunk people out there  I guess we got, uh, drunk Irish Earl today 
[02:26:30]  Drunk Irish Earl  And Asian Earl  And Asian Earl  And, uh, also some really hot chick from Philly that wants to, uh, wow us  Yep  It is whip them out Wednesday, Anthony  The season has begun today  Uh, Lindsey from Cleveland  What's going on  Hi  Lindsey  You stupid  Lindsey  Hello  Hey  Hey, Bridgewater  Lindsey  Yeah, yesterday  Turn the radio down, you dope  Lindsey  Yeah, I'm here

It's going to get nuts  Or real  Kreskin  Someone sent in an email  Because Kreskin did this amazing car trick 
[02:29:30]  Yeah  And he said he had a run  Because he's convinced that all the reporters  Are going to have to interview him immediately  He's like, no, they'll be downstairs waiting  And then it's like, all right, Rick  Go down with Kreskin  And call us up  When the reporters are down there  And he's like, well, at another location  Right  Not downstairs  Right  Near stairs, though  So Mike from Bayside  Throw yourself down the stairs  And perhaps a photographer will show up  It's a Wes Craven film  The press at the bottom of the stairs 
[02:30:00]  Jackass  Mike from Bayside  Oh, God, this is brilliant  Kreskin is like the old man at the home  Who's waiting for his family to show up  But they never come  Oh, that's sad  What, Kreskin with his clown makeup and his suit  Waiting for the reporters to show up  He had his police makeup on  Yeah, they'll be here any moment  I know it  He came in and OPSed him  What's with the makeup?
