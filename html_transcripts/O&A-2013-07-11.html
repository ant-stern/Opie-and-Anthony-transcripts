<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony show opened with a raucous discussion of SyFy's "Sharknado," its ludicrous plot, and its comparison to other similarly low-budget films like "Sharktopus," "Mansquito," and "Dino Shark."  The hosts, Opie, Anthony, and Jim Norton, provided vulgar commentary and played clips from these films, focusing on the poor special effects and ridiculous storylines.  They also briefly touched on the Zimmerman trial and political bias in news networks.  A clip from a previous interview with Tucker Max was played, featuring a highly unbelievable anecdote involving nudity, vomiting, and defecation, which the hosts relentlessly mocked and called out as a lie.  The hosts' skepticism was further fueled by Max's unconvincing explanation for the lack of video evidence.

The show then shifted to a discussion of guest scheduling, expressing anger at Michael Cera's cancelled appearance due to his management deeming it unsuitable.  Justin Bieber's recent antics, including urinating in a bucket and defacing a picture of Bill Clinton, were also discussed.  This led to book reports from female interns on an episode of the 1970s TV show *Quincy*, highlighting its unusual pre-episode previews and clich√©s. A male intern, Jerry, also submitted a book report despite misunderstanding the assignment.

David Spade was then introduced as a guest. The conversation covered his new movie *Grown Ups 2*, its box office success, anecdotes from the premiere (including a story about Shaq's height), his childhood, dysfunctional family, career, and early romantic struggles.  Charlie Day joined the show next, discussing his career, bad commercials, early acting roles (including a scene with Mary Tyler Moore), and *It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia*.  The conversation included various side tangents and humorous remarks, including a discussion of Danny DeVito's acting style.  A review of *Pacific Rim* followed, featuring an actor guest who detailed the film's practical effects and contrasted them with the CGI in *Sharknado*.  The actor also shared anecdotes about his time as a waiter and experiences with online hate and overzealous fans. James Cromwell then joined the show in studio.  They discussed Cromwell's role in *Still Mine*, political transparency, and the short memories of the American public regarding political scandals.  Cromwell also shared anecdotes about his early career and the differences between network and cable television.

The "After Opie and Anthony Live" show continued with Sam Roberts, featuring in-studio guests David Spade, Charlie Day, and James Cromwell.  Comedian Joe DeRosa called in, discussing his comedy gigs, past appearances on the show, and an online dispute with a staff member, E-Rock.  Josh Matthews from WWE also joined, engaging in a discussion about fashion, exercise trends, and professional wrestling, including his work on *WWE Main Event*, the Wyatt Family, and the "Money in the Bank" pay-per-view.  The show concluded with a plug for Dollar Shave Club and a critical discussion of the "Morning Mashup" radio show.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  Good morning, I'm Christopher Lloyd and I'm standing here at the studios of Sirius XM Satellite Radio.  It's a weekly morning, approximately 6 a.m., and this is the Opie and Anthony Show.  Never before has one radio show been so extreme.  So vulgar. 
[00:00:30]  I'll fucking shove my face up a chick's ass in a second.  Someone said we curse a lot, do we?  I have no idea if we do.  So, for last you didn't.  Who just farted?  I did, but I didn't know it started.  Like rotten eggs and sewage.  Oh, wow, thank you.  I can't believe that us sitting around like this is actually a radio show.  This is not going to get any better than this.  Are we on the air?  No, we are.  Oh, okay.  Point simply, the greatest show in the history of broadcasting.  All in every day, that's what I say.  You guys having a good time or what? 
[00:01:00]  Yeah!  Rules are destroyed.  And conventions burn the ground.  Would you like to make a fucking second?  With Opie, the destroyer.  I would eat Betty White's ass.  She's 90, right?  Why does it smell too bad?  Anthony, the rage.  Holy fuck, how much more fair you wanted?  Fire these people up my ass all the time trying to get me to help.  Fuck you!  And Jim Norton, lover of the transgender. 
[00:01:30]  Every time a transsexual walks in the room, party horn should go off.  Surprise!  It's the Opie and Anthony show.  Strap in, dicks.  This one's gonna hurt.  Double gun, bitch.  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road.  Yes!  Good morning, everyone.  Look at that.  Back at it.  Right back at it. 
[00:02:00]  Not shitting anymore, so.  Just want to report that.  Nice.  And I did shower, so.  Oh, wow.  People love the fact that I didn't shower for six days.  A double shot.  What's the big deal?  Why do you not think you're no longer shitting?  Huh?  So you're not gonna shit anymore?  No, man.  Ever?  I'm done with shitting.  Oh, my God.  That would be lovely to say that.  I beat the shit out of my asshole yesterday.  Oh.  I had to run out during Judge Alex.  Whoa.  Yeah, yeah, yeah. 
[00:02:30]  You saw that.  I mean, we run out every once in a while, you know, because an interview's going long,  or, you know.  My participation is not needed.  But yesterday, man, he was great.  And I'm like, shit, I think I'm gonna shit my pants.  That's all I'm thinking.  It's just weird.  Yeah, he was all over again yesterday.  Huh?  He was all over TV again yesterday.  Yeah.  And Twitter and stuff.  He's very active in this.  His name's really getting around because of the Zimmerman trial. 
[00:03:00]  He's a Fox guy, though.  That's what people told me on Twitter.  Guys have another Fox guy on.  God, there's such babies.  He's got another Fox guy on.  He's all over CNN.  I just found him really fascinating to listen to.  That's how I look at that shit.  If people, I don't understand people that are like, folks, folks.  If you go to CNN or MSNBC, it's worse than Fox as far as them being the conservative right-wing 
[00:03:30]  republic, whatever you want to call it, news station.  And, yeah, they definitely have a bias.  I'm not stupid.  But you look at MSNBC or CNN, they're so far the other way that they bypass how bad Fox  is the other way.  I don't know about that.  I absolutely think so.  I think there's equivalent.  No, not equivalent.  I would say no. 
[00:04:00]  You think MSNBC is way worse than Fox?  It's just when you watch Fox's coverage of even this trial, they're giving you a lot  more of what's going on fact-wise and not as much fucking...  People are going to say you've been brainwashed.  Do you know that, right?  No.  You know, I haven't even been watching a lot of Fox during this.  I've been watching a lot of MSNBC.  Oh, but you have a lot to say about it.  Well, I watch it now.  But I don't watch exclusively.  People say, what are you doing watching that HLN? 
[00:04:30]  It's going to drive you crazy.  It's like, well, you've got to watch...  It's like Judge Alex said yesterday.  You've got to kind of watch all of it.  Right.  And see, you know...  Make your own opinion?  Yeah.  And, man, MSNBC has got to be the worst.  That is the worst channel on fucking...  What does that have to do with Sharknado?  Sharknado?  Yeah, what does that have to do with Sharknado?  I don't think...  I think it's sci-fi, right?  Sci-fi's got Sharknado?  Yes.  Yes.  Sharknado.  Sharknado is going to be all the rage. 
[00:05:00]  I'm telling you right now.  What is it?  This has Patrice written all over it.  Sharknado.  What is it, Jimmy says?  It's on tonight at 9 o'clock on sci-fi.  Which rivaled all other great movies ever made.  It sounds like a trade agreement between Aquatic Life.  Jesus.  Sharknado is a fine movie where a bunch of storms start getting together.  And a lot of tornadoes hit the United States. 
[00:05:30]  But not only are tornadoes hit, they hit the ocean first.  With some water spouting going on.  Water spouts.  And in that, they pick up a bunch of sharks.  Oh, shitload of sharks.  As they then move over land, the sharks are flung out of the tornadoes and start eating people.  I'm telling you, we don't talk about the sci-fi movies a lot.  But this one, I'm telling you right now, people are going to be talking about it for days.  Sharknado is on sci-fi tonight.  It's the dumbest thing.  So a bunch of dead sharks will be... 
[00:06:00]  They're not dead.  No, no, they're alive.  What's wrong with you, Jimmy?  They're alive.  Oh.  And they're biting people.  On the way down?  Yeah.  One ends up on the top of an SUV while it's driving.  Oh, look out.  And gets into the sunroof.  Yeah.  Oh, that's cool.  Because they can't breathe without the fucking water.  So it's just gasping for air.  Well, but he's biting also.  Remember our old pal David Hinckley?  Uh-huh.  Used to write about radio, and then radio died.  So they said, ah, why don't you write about TV and such?  Yeah. 
[00:06:30]  He writes in the Daily News today, Sharknado is bad to the bone.  Oh.  It's about...  It's absurd.  It's ridiculous.  If you're a fan of low-budget horror movies, then don't miss this one.  You will regret it for the rest of your life.  Wow.  Uh, Sharknado.  Top sci-fi's previous gem, Sharktopus.  Sharktopus.  As effortlessly as a hungry fish drops out of the sky into the swimming pool at a retirement community. 
[00:07:00]  Oh, man.  See?  So at least one shark makes it into the retirement community's pool.  Wow.  Yes, that happens.  And someone tells a retirement community resident, run.  And she replies, I can't run.  I can't even walk.  Oh, damn.  The premise of Sharknado, just so no one accidentally mistakes it for Argo, is that a huge Pacific storm has morphed into tornadoes.  As the water spouts gain strength over the ocean off the coast of L.A., they suck up thousands of sharks. 
[00:07:30]  Look out.  When they move inland and lose power, they spill out the sharks like pinatas, gone terribly wrong.  The sharks swim along flooded freeways and slam through windows to gobble up people inside.  Oh, my God.  One shark not only finds a way to secure itself to the top of an SUV going 40 to 50 miles an hour, but it pries open the moonroof to see what kind of tasty morsels are nervously waiting inside.  By the way, the lovely and talented Tara Reid is in this. 
[00:08:00]  Big star.  They've got a big star for this one.  I think a lot of 90s stars are in it, right?  I don't know.  Got, like, Tara Reid.  And Steve from 90210.  Steve from 90210.  Oh, really?  Well, sci-fi is the place to go.  Let's not forget about Tiffany and the other broad there.  Oh, yeah.  Huh?  Debbie Gibson.  Oh, yeah.  Debbie Gibson, for sure.  You know what hurts?  I can't get a show on TV, but somebody looked at this and said Sharknado, green light it.  Green light it.  Oh, these are all the rage these guys have the movies.  Green light it. 
[00:08:30]  Remember Patrice talking about these?  Yeah.  With, you know, he was talking about how the sci-fi movies have a title.  Like, it's just very obvious if it's, what was it?  I'm trying to remember.  Giant bear that's attacking people in the woods.  It would be giant woods bear.  Right.  Like, he's just talking about how bad the titles are.  And boy, I don't think he ever saw Sharknado coming.  No.  Nor does the human dialogue lack bite with lines like, I hate sharks. 
[00:09:00]  I'm from Wyoming.  Dinosaur forest was one of Patrice's.  Dinosaur forest instead of Jurassic Park.  That's right.  Dinosaur forest.  That was a famous one from Patrice O'Neill.  Dinosaur forest.  Don't think for a minute that being in Sharknado makes the actors seem ridiculous.  On the contrary, stars like, and then they list most of the people you were just saying,  make it look like a day at the beach.  How often do you find a role where it's impossible to overact?  Sharknado is an hour and a half of your life that you'll never get back. 
[00:09:30]  And you won't want to.  It's getting good reviews, Sharknado.  Do we have the trailer?  Sounds like a hit.  Can we start from the beginning?  Oh, please.  All right.  Let me hear the Sharknado one.  It's about to tear through the city of life.  Sharks.  Tornado.  Sharknado.  Nusset.  We're going to be a bigger chopper.  We're going to stand and fight.  Tara Reid in the sci-fi original movie, Sharknado, premieres next Thursday at 9. 
[00:10:00]  Only on Sci-Fi.  The guy said we're going to stand and fight.  They're dead.  They're fish.  They're going to die.  It's not going to rain forever.  Yeah, just wait it out.  Wait.  Just wait it out.  We're going to stand and fight.  It's going to flop five feet in front of you.  It's harmless.  Jimmy.  How is this a movie?  Jimmy, you're ruining Sharknado.  I don't mean to ruin Sharknado, but it's the most ridiculous thing I've ever fucking heard of.  You're a bummer.  It's like literally having a movie about astronauts where elephants are shot from a rocket and free-floating in space, and they might hit you with their trunks. 
[00:10:30]  You're a bummer, man.  This is what sci-fi does.  Terrible.  Did they say they're going to need a bigger chopper?  Yes.  Yes.  Oh, do you know how I didn't even catch that?  Yeah, yeah.  We're going to need a bigger chopper.  That's a ripoff.  What do you think of this network should be?  Garbage.  What are some of the other clips they have available right now?  These are just the other movies that they've done.  What are some of the other movies?  Yeah.  Independence Disaster. 
[00:11:00]  Nice.  Love Hurts.  What?  What does Love Hurts have to do with it?  It's about a rental car gone wrong.  Sharktopus.  Yeah, can we see Sharktopus?  Sharktopus.  Sharktopus.  Yeah, this sci-fi is great.  You can turn up the volume.  Oh, you got it.  Groovy music.  Yeah, there are people on the beach.  Big waves.  Some chicks and frolicking in the water. 
[00:11:30]  Nice.  Whoa.  Some great CGI.  Whoa.  Wait, wait, pause this.  Was there some kind of mutation?  I guess the shark and the octopus had some sex there.  Oh, that was a sex scene?  And they made a sharktopus. 
[00:12:00]  Oh, okay.  And wow, it's amazing.  There's some kind of mechanics on there.  So I think there is some kind of secret company or government involvement.  Well, who is that, by the way?  Eric Roberts.  Eric Roberts.  Good old Eric Roberts.  Oh, my.  But a shark is no scarier with long arms.  Like, have you ever been near a shark where you're like, oh, thank God he doesn't have arms long enough to grab me?  Like, where are you where eight-foot arms are going to be the difference between you and a hungry shark? 
[00:12:30]  That's true.  They don't need arms.  Well, Jimmy, you're a bummer.  But I think a shark, if he can grab you, he can get you within a second.  He can get you just swimming.  Yeah.  Yeah, but if an octopus is dangerous and a shark is dangerous, then a sharktopus is too dangerous.  Yeah, that's true right there.  No, it's not at all.  A sharktopus would just look ridiculous and be all encumbered by his stupid arms.  Can't swim as well.  Imagine a, imagine a, imagine a e-rocktopus. 
[00:13:00]  Oh, no.  Oh, no, it's got eight arms and a trunk.  Oh, no, it's got eight stomachs.  Sorry, Eric, I don't mean that.  Oh, e-rock.  Isn't that cool?  Let's see the rest of it.  Yeah, let's see the government.  Eight wrong buttons hit at once.  Apologize.  But the core has just created the Navy's next superweapon.  Oh.  That's a creature, creature with a double T-J-E.  Freak at sea swamp, let's do peace. 
[00:13:30]  There, twist it, there.  She's some other night.  Oh, people are scuba diving.  Yeah.  There's no sharktopus.  Oh.  They've got a song for it and everything.  Nice.  Oh.  Oh.  See, Jimmy, see, they proved you wrong.  That's how sharktopus does it.  The shark part can stay in the water.  Oh.  And the tentacles come out on the beach and pull you in.  And grab the bathers right into the water.  And it's amazing how the giant sharktopus can come up on eight inches of surf and yet be 
[00:14:00]  disappeared completely.  Yes, exactly.  A sharktopus looks like a shark that is wearing the hat from the guy from the village people,  the Indian.  It looks like Felipe Rose if he was a shark.  Sharktopus looks like a shark to cock.  You can just be hanging out on the beach, though, and you're done.  Oh, yeah.  Very scary.  That could be it.  Imagine sharktopus NATO, where it's fucking throwing sharktopuses all over.  I bet they do that at some point. 
[00:14:30]  Oh, yeah.  That's on the elevator.  Ding.  It's on your floor.  Why are they running?  I don't know.  I like that the...  Wait a minute.  Now it's getting silly.  The sharktopus growls like it's Sal's production.  I was all in, but now it's getting silly.  What do you mean?  They seemed completely safe when they were running away on the beach. 
[00:15:00]  Yeah, yeah.  How long are these tentacles?  Yeah, how far can this thing reach out?  That was ridiculous.  I'd say about 12 feet.  Yeah, but they were more than 12 feet away from the water at that point.  Hold on.  Sharktopus.  Have you ever seen octopus kind of almost walk on rocks?  Yeah, but what about the shark part, though?  Does he walk...  That just shark part hangs out there and eats things.  Can he walk onto the beach?  Yes.  Because it looks like I saw the actual shark face.  I bet he could.  He is.  Go back a little bit, Sam.  The shark pops up.  Yes.  And what happens is there's some people shopping at a hat stand, and he pops up behind them. 
[00:15:30]  And the tentacles can stab you.  Yeah, yeah.  It doesn't make sense.  That part is dumb.  It's a weapon by the Navy.  That is true.  Make your finger on a sharktopus.  Sharktopus.  Yeah.  That sharktopus comes right out of the water, I think. 
[00:16:00]  You see that?  Sharktopus was out of the water.  Sharktopus growled and came up behind the rocks.  That's a good acting right there.  Good freeze frame, man.  That guy looks really scared.  That's probably actually a secret of a fucking handycam of him looking at the script.  Handycam.  Real showbiz talk, Jim.  Handycam.  Handheld, I meant. 
[00:16:30]  Handycam.  Oh, Klaus, look at that.  The sharktopus has actually stole someone's ticket and is getting their car out of valet.  Why would he go in the water if there's a sharktopus around?  You just stay out of the water and you're fine.  This lady's on a swing rope there.  Yes.  She can't be on the beach of the rocks either.  She's swinging across some kind of lagoon.  You know what's going to happen here.  She ain't going to make it.  No, she's right behind the San Francisco airport and you see sharktopus reach up and swat the 
[00:17:00]  plane tail.  That's what happened.  It was a sharktopus.  Sharktopus.  This is so bad.  Yeah, see?  Wow.  What about the boat?  The speedboat.  What could possibly happen?  What?  What?  The sharktopus is coming out of the water and hovering above the boat with us.  It looked like the government controls exploded off of sharktopus. 
[00:17:30]  Oh, man.  So now sharktopus has gone rogue.  It looked like it.  Oh, no.  It's gone rogue?  Oh, no.  A rogue sharktopus is one of the more dangerous.  It's terrible.  And they have toupees, which is really odd, so you never can tell a real sharktopus.  Like, a lot of times they'll masquerade as somebody you know using 9-11 fucking technology  to masquerade as the voices.  Sharktopus.  The government's got, you know, sharktopuses. 
[00:18:00]  Eight false flags.  False flags right there in the tentacles.  Sharktopus.  If you don't want to believe in sharktopus, that's your problem.  Jesse.  Let's get you.  Sharktopus.  Whatever happened to that guy?  I don't know.  Yeah, all right.  Where is he?  Mexico?  Mexico.  Yeah.  Saving some money.  Off the grid?  Off the grid.  No cell phone?  No. 
[00:18:30]  I like going off grid for a while.  But then he's on grid more than anyone.  Of course he is.  He's got to do Piers Morgan.  But other than that, off the grid.  Off the grid.  Yeah, that doesn't make sense.  Let's play the rest of this.  The Navy said they wanted a killing machine.  That's exactly what I gave them.  The greatness comes at a price.  It always has.  Uh-oh.  She's bungee jumping?  Oh, good.  Yeah, Sharktopus is going to jump out of the water.  Yeah, he's not having any of that. 
[00:19:00]  Oh, no!  Oh, shit!  Oh, man.  Sharktopus.  Jumped up and just ate her.  Yep.  Yeah, she's bungee jumping, and Sharktopus just sees that as a dangling treat.  Oh, yeah.  Who wouldn't?  Eric Roberts is not just going to do some shitty movie.  Yeah, he's great.  He's a great actor.  They took my eight thumbs, Charlie.  Poor Eric Roberts.  I'm with you, Jimmy.  What a promising career he had in his younger days.  You think he looks at his sister and says, just put me in a fucking movie already?  He was the guy. 
[00:19:30]  You know what?  He was bigger than Julia Roberts before Julia Roberts kind of really broke.  Then it was like, oh, who's this?  Look at Eric Roberts' sister.  Now, and then he ends up on Celebrity Rehab, or was he in the sober house?  I forget.  I think he was Rehab.  Yeah.  He had an addiction to marijuana.  Yeah, it got so bad, he's on Celebrity Rehab.  He accepted that gig.  Is that more Sharknado?  Yeah, there's a sneak peek of Sharknado.  Oh, let's see.  But someone is also telling me that we got to play the Sharknado trailer from YouTube for Jim Norton. 
[00:20:00]  Okay, I think it might be the same.  All right, let's make sure.  This is this Ferris wheel.  This wheel getting blown away by the storm, looking sort of like Tony Island.  Oh, boy.  I was probably saying I'm on the floor, actually.  Oh, wait, it's...  A guy picks up a thing just like Brody.  Oh, the shark!  What a...  And he puts the fucking tank in its mouth like Brody. 
[00:20:30]  That's just the jaws rip off.  All right.  Come on, EB!  Now we're watching a Ferris wheel kind of come apart.  And he's on it still?  Oh, the Ferris wheel's rolling now.  Yeah.  Oh, no.  Down the dock, I think.  They don't evacuate here before the hurricane.  They let you ride it out.  Everyone's running away from the Ferris wheel.  It's rolling at them.  Rolling and crushing people.  So instead of going to the side, they run straight ahead.  Oh, it's Santa Monica.  It is Santa Monica.  Okay.  Yeah.  It was. 
[00:21:00]  How far is this Ferris wheel?  Oh, the guy just got crushed.  Oh, it just hit a building.  It wouldn't go through a building.  How do you know?  Have you ever seen a Ferris wheel hit a building?  All right.  Good point.  In the middle of a Sharknado?  Right.  You got me.  What a ripoff.  That was horrible.  It's almost like they're just doing funny trailers.  Yeah.  Yeah, yeah.  And they don't mean it.  And they have to make like a movie for it.  People love these dumb movies.  They really do.  They do very, very well.  They do, right?  Yeah.  And Sharknado is going to kill tonight.  It should, too. 
[00:21:30]  Yeah.  What's better than Sharknado?  Sharktopus.  Sharktopus.  Yeah.  That's debatable.  Dinosaur Forest.  Sharkades.  Sharkades.  I like the octopus I like better.  Eroctopus is good.  Eroctopus rules.  Oh, my God.  Do you want to see the trailer for Dino Shark?  No.  They love sharks.  Sharks are frightening.  What's Dino Shark about?  Prehistoric shark?  It should be just a shark. 
[00:22:00]  Yeah, exactly.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Sharks really haven't changed much.  This is a shark with brown eyes instead of blue.  All right.  Let's look at Dino Shark.  What the hell?  Alaska.  Alaska.  Okay.  A piece of ice fell off.  Yeah.  And apparently it's going to unfreeze.  Oh, Dino Shark.  They look like crusty sharks.  Right.  There's a shark with barnacles on it.  Yeah.  These creatures have been extinct for over 150 million years. 
[00:22:30]  The CGI is so bad on these.  Yeah.  It looks like a kid in his tub.  And now there's more boaters that these prehistoric sharks are going to come.  And the CGI is kind of important for these movies, don't you think?  Did you see how big Dino Shark is?  She's massive, dude.  Yeah.  But wait, that wasn't big.  That was a swimming pool.  Biting legs off.  Yeah, it's just a lot of underwater shots.  I know shark changes size a lot. 
[00:23:00]  Yeah, it does.  Oh, boy.  Oh, there's a guy parasailing.  Yay.  This is the same thing as the bungee.  Sure is.  Wow.  Here comes a guy with a nice hiney.  Going in the water.  Oh, look.  The shark's jerking off instead of eating her.  Oh, boy.  Oh, there's half of her.  Who is that guy?  Oh, that's the dude.  We had him on once.  Yeah, he's been on.  Who is that?  We had him on? 
[00:23:30]  Oh, yeah.  He used to be on six feet under.  No, he started on MTV, though.  No, that's not Simon.  Oh, was it?  No.  It looks like him.  Okay.  Who is that?  Just gear.  He's jumping over Dino Shark.  Oh, no, he's throwing a grenade.  What's going on?  He threw a hand grenade at Dino Shark.  Oh, it just kind of blew a fin off of Dino Shark.  And then he lands next to Dino Shark.  Wow.  Wow, that's scary. 
[00:24:00]  If he gets top billing like that, that's pretty good.  Yeah.  This is so stupid.  Why would you want your name on top?  I want my name listed.  Oh, no.  The CGI in Dino Shark is pretty much on the level of the cartoons interacting with real people  and Roger Rabbit.  Yeah, yeah.  It's just like drawn.  It's horrible.  There's no depth to them.  There's no color matching or contrast matching.  No, that one's all story.  It looks terrible.  It's all story.  It doesn't need the effects.  It's all on the page.  A good story transcends the effects. 
[00:24:30]  Yeah.  Is there a Sharknado trailer on YouTube that's different or was that the same shit?  Shark?  Because it's all about Sharknado tonight.  Sci-fi.  These are fucking great movies.  Oh, Chippa likes these?  Fuck yeah.  I wrote one just like it.  What was it called?  It's called Pekka Shark.  Of course it is.  He's got a giant Pekka.  Pekka.  And he drags it over people and eats them.  Pekka.  All right.  No worries.  Why did we get anybody from Sharknado on our show? 
[00:25:00]  Oh, why didn't Roland get us some Sharknado?  Roland has failed us.  Guys, we got the guy from Sharknado.  We got the director, the producer of Sharknado.  You guys definitely would have said yes to Ian Ziering, right?  Yes.  Yeah, sure.  Or his hat and glasses.  Jesus.  Ian Ziering.  I'm tired.  Ian Ziering.  Was there a movie called Mansquito?  No way. 
[00:25:30]  Mansquito.  Dean Harding on Twitter is telling me.  Watch out for the Mansquitos.  Tell me Mansquito was a classic.  Is there a Mansquito?  Yeah.  Let's say.  I want to see me some Mansquito.  Sure.  Well, we can watch the entire movie, which is 86 minutes.  Oh, let's do that.  Here's the trailer.  The disease affects both young and old.  Every man is full and their encephalitis.  He was scheduled to take part in our experimental drug testing program.  Wait, wait, wait. 
[00:26:00]  What are you saying?  It's a you're experimenting on convicts?  Too little.  Who was that?  Too much.  And who knows what you'd get.  Open it!  Convict gets out?  Yeah.  Uh-oh.  Is there any mosquito blood in them?  Are they...  Oh, no.  Oh, shit.  I bet a bunch of, like, mosquitoes bite them.  Oh, shit. 
[00:26:30]  Oh, no.  Yeah, yeah.  Another mutation.  He's a man and a mosquito.  Oh, shit.  He's turning into a mosquito.  Oh, no.  Like the flying?  Yeah, exactly like the fly.  You know how bummed I'd be if I had a picnic planned with him the next day?  He's a brundle-squito.  Uh-oh.  Oh, she's becoming a mosquito.  Wow.  Cunt-squito.  Hot leak.  Cunt-squito.  She just buzzes around and annoys you like every other woman I've ever dated.  He wants to meet some. 
[00:27:00]  That's why he's a mosquito.  She flies in and bites you while the game is on.  He's here!  You don't know what you're up against.  You can't go in there.  Is that Parker Lewis?  Hey!  Hey!  That's a mosquito!  Oh, I think so.  Parker Lewis can't lose.  Parker Lewis can't lose.  I don't know why they're shooting.  A giant can of rage.  That's a slice of life.  It totally is.  And she's someone killed.  Monsquito!  Monsquito's just attacking people.  And he was somebody. 
[00:27:30]  Oh, Mosquito Man is called.  It's called Mosquito Man.  Mosquito Man.  Mosquito Man.  Man.  I guess that actually confirms that Parker Lewis can indeed lose.  Yes!  Parker Lewis can lose.  Wow.  That's terrible.  Mosquito Man.  It's Mosquito Man slash Monsquito.  Right.  So, you know.  Probably later on they realized Monsquito is just a much more marketable.  Yes.  Yes.  Yeah.  Monsquito. 
[00:28:00]  Yes.  Sounds like Bullshito.  I know.  Wow.  Yeah.  Sci-fi is obviously spent in the hundreds of dollars.  But they have spent a lot of money.  How can they make their money back on these?  They're huge.  I guess they're advertising.  They are huge.  They didn't spend a lot of money on these things.  The CGI is horrendous.  They're terrible.  They're very culty.  And I think they get an audience over time as kind of a little fun thing.  Yeah. 
[00:28:30]  And they're getting known for doing these things.  Right.  Like, I think they used to seriously think they were making science fiction movies.  Right.  And they'd get, you know, low budget.  But I think they took them seriously until people started really laughing at them.  Right.  And then they just said, all right, fuck it.  Let's just not even try to fucking fake this anymore.  Yeah.  Because Debbie Gibson and Tiffany were in here promoting one of those movies.  Yeah.  What was the name of theirs again?  Something versus something.  Oh, right.  Cunt versus cunt. 
[00:29:00]  But they spelled with a K because it's not offensive.  Yeah.  And they said cunt.  Do you think that wouldn't be offensive still to people?  Yeah.  Called cunt versus cunt.  Oh, Mega Python versus Gatoroid.  Oh, great.  Yeah, that's right.  About my penis against the Gatoroid.  Jesus.  Oh, God.  Oh, no.  It's a giant penis fucking an ass.  Yes.  It's giving him a Gatoroid.  See?  Yes.  I thought it was Megaroid.  Oh.  I ruined that one first. 
[00:29:30]  Is it a Megaroid?  No, it's Megapython.  No, Megapython.  Mega Python.  Gatoroid.  And Gatoroid.  I love that stuff when I'm doing sports.  Yeah, that's what happens when your asshole's getting a good workout.  You need some Gatoroid.  How about Irocodile?  Irocodile.  Irocodile.  Irocodile.  I just want Iroc in one of these.  I'm trying to get you in one of these sci-fi movies, Iroc.  Thanks.  Look at Debbie Gibson right there.  Which one do you like so far? 
[00:30:00]  Do you want to be Irocodile or Iroctopus?  I think the Iroctopus one.  Yeah.  Any inspiration from these for your own motion picture?  Oh, very good question.  No, there's no time travel.  Well, there could be.  Yeah, you could have had a little time travel in one of these movies easily.  These are actually more believable.  Than the Iroct movie.  And I'm not sure.  There might have been some time travel in Dino Croc versus Super Gator.  Yeah, I bet there was.  I think there was.  People are still trying to say, I got the official trailer right here of Sam Roberts. 
[00:30:30]  Sharknado, official asylum trailer.  Too violent for TV.  It's up on the Facebook, too.  Oh, really?  Is Sam Roberts getting yelled at?  I just watched two trailers for the movie.  Huh?  How much more did we see?  Yeah, I don't know.  We just watched two.  No, we didn't watch trailers.  We were watching, like, highlights.  No, we watched the official trailer from SyFy.  No, we didn't.  Uh-oh.  No, we didn't.  Okay, but we didn't.  Damn.  We did not.  You're in trouble now.  You're right. 
[00:31:00]  With who?  With who, exactly.  With who?  Oh, he's just making things up to pester me.  No, I'm not.  He's just being disagreeable.  Nope.  That's not true.  Okay.  That's being corrected.  I guess from the weather in Sharknado, there's a lot of flooding.  So when the sharks flop down into the water that the flooding is from, they can, you know. 
[00:31:30]  Yeah.  Jimmy made a great point about, you know.  Is that it?  They allow people to hang out until the hurricane is pretty much on them.  Dude, who rides the ferrous wheel until you see the storm?  This is where you want Bloomberg.  We have a tornado of sharks coming.  Get off the...  Is that one we haven't seen?  Stevie Knight hooked it up on Twitter.  Let's see.  Different.  Let's see.  All right.  Who's the official trailer?  It's a storm.  That's what's driven them all up north.  I've never seen so many up north. 
[00:32:00]  Oh, shit.  It's the boss for big.  It's the guy who goes, uh...  It's a bug.  It's a bug.  It's a bug.  It's a bug.  That guy.  Baskins?  That was him.  Yeah.  He's in Sharknado.  Wasn't that the father from Home Alone, too?  Yep.  The father from Home Alone.  And he was a...  There you go.  He was the cop in Sopranos.  Who?  He was a...  Yes.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  He's good.  He was also a bad guy in something else.  Wait a minute.  But the father from Home Alone is now in Sharknado. 
[00:32:30]  That's a bit of a drop-off, don't you think?  Drop-off?  What else was he in?  Although it's been 20 years.  Yeah.  Yeah, that's right.  He was the guy in fucking Sopranos.  That's why he had no respect for it.  Wasn't he almost...  Was he a teacher or something?  There was something else he's been in.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  He's awesome.  Is he awesome?  Yeah, dude.  How about in Sharknado?  Sharknado.  We're gonna find out.  Can't be bad in that movie.  You wouldn't last.  Yeah, true.  True.  You can't be sitting there next to Ian Ziering in a movie like Sharknado. 
[00:33:00]  Absolutely.  You gotta switch seats.  You gotta keep doing Ian Ziering.  Absolutely.  Radar love.  All right.  Sorry.  Iraq, what about Nagopotamus?  What about Nagopotamus?  That just came in on Twitter.  It's like a thinner hippo.  I fucked up.  I meant...  Six days on the road on Twitter.  Thank you.  It's a fatter hippo.  I know.  I said the opposite.  I'm sorry, listening audience.  We got it.  It was still funny because you understood the intent. 
[00:33:30]  God damn it.  Yeah.  Boo.  Sharknado?  Oh, by the way, who was right here and who was wrong?  Stephen Knight.  No.  Oh, no.  I brought it to the show's attention through Stephen Knight, and you refused to believe  that there was another trailer out there.  I didn't refuse to believe.  I needed Stephen Knight to show me.  You absolutely refused to believe.  Snackasaurus, I'm getting here.  For Iraq?  Yeah.  That could be cool.  Mm-hmm.  That'd be good. 
[00:34:00]  I've never seen so many of them, nor so bold.  Wow.  It's really even raining.  It's flooding here.  And not the plumbing.  The ocean.  Oh.  You need to go home.  I'm not going anywhere.  Storm's coming, and it's coming fast.  Oh.  Sharknado's flying through a window.  Wait.  Can you go back?  I want to see how full is that pier when the tornado hits.  I've never seen more people having fun.  Well, you know, tornadoes come around quickly there, Jim Norton.  Did you hear Ian's earring?  He said it's coming, and it's coming fast. 
[00:34:30]  Fast.  Yeah, yeah.  You didn't expect it.  Oh, I thought he was talking about me.  They're in a bar.  You need to go home.  Big, huge window.  Storm's coming, and it's coming fast.  And then a shark comes back.  Isn't that a lot of people?  Just can't sit back and watch this.  See?  It's the flooded streets.  Tornado's heading towards the airport.  We need to destroy it before it gets to them.  They're shooting sharks out of the sky. 
[00:35:00]  That would be pretty cool to do.  There's a shark to run down on.  Bim!  Oh, man.  Whoa, he cut the shark in half with a chainsaw.  Into the tornadoes.  Too dangerous.  That's exactly how that would happen.  Too many of them.  We're going to need a bigger chopper.  Oh, wow.  Bloody a move!  He's trying to leave Kansas, mate.  And there's the scene with the giant Ferris wheel.  Whoa, shark day, ho.  Go!  Nice.  Check your local listings. 
[00:35:30]  It's fucking believable.  That shit could happen.  I like it.  It could not chip up.  What, you think there was problems there?  Yeah.  A few problems.  Inconsistencies?  Like what, man?  What the hell?  You wouldn't survive if a shark went flying through your window at home?  No.  It could have been anything NATO.  Because the sharks, it could have just been fucking lumber.  Lumber NATO.  How about kitten NATO?  Tornadoes are very dangerous. 
[00:36:00]  It's like they kill people all the time.  But what about kitten NATO?  How could that be dangerous?  Little kittens flying at you.  Or imagine if there were tunas being thrown.  It would be called toro NATO.  Sushi joke.  All right.  Toro NATO.  I thought you were going to say to NATO.  Oh, that's funnier.  Yeah, I know.  It's better.  Really.  It's not a sushi joke.  I know.  That's why it's better.  Sushi jokes are never a hit.  B-Rock, what about Mayo-Saurus? 
[00:36:30]  Would you like that one?  No.  Oh, he likes that mayo.  Fuck.  Croc of mayo.  Croc of mayo.  You're ungrateful, man.  It's good.  People are trying to come up with a sci-fi movie for you.  Yeah.  Hmm.  Jurassic Fork?  How about that one?  Jurassic Fork.  Do you like that one?  I like that one a lot.  That was Daily Leader, I think, on Twitter. 
[00:37:00]  Dino sandwich.  How come sharks are the only fish blown up by the storm?  Great question coming in.  Because the storm is a sharknado.  Yeah.  Not a fishnado.  What about, like, other fish in the ocean, though?  They didn't suck up any of those bastards?  The sharks ate them.  What about a nice swordfish?  The sharks are right at the surface, you know.  Is that why?  Yeah.  Although, you would probably get some seaweed, too.  A seaweed nato doesn't sound very dangerous.  So, definitely no flounder.  No.  Because they're a little deeper.  They're all right.  What about a nice sea robin? 
[00:37:30]  Those are scary.  You don't have to fucking CGI those bastards.  That's a scary fish to begin with.  They got eaten by the sharks.  They're very dangerous sharks.  That's true.  And they're all huge sharks, by the way.  Yeah, massive.  They're all, like, the same huge size.  It's, like, somebody just made one and copy-pasted it.  Exactly.  Well, they have to.  They don't have much of a budget for Sharknado.  Want me to make another shark?  It's like, oh, can't they just scale down the one they have?  It's very easy on the computer. 
[00:38:00]  Scale it down.  Who are we?  Hey, come on.  We don't have a fucking movie.  I've used After Effects.  It's kind of easy.  They have an intern doing the CGI for this.  And that's what it looks like, too.  They must have had interns on there.  Speaking of interns, we've got to do our book reports.  Yes, that's right.  We have to.  Get gals in here.  Can we do it next break?  Yeah, easily.  Because it's guest day.  We've got guest day.  Who's coming in today?  Somebody from Sharknado, I think.  Sharknado?  Yes, the shark. 
[00:38:30]  That's great.  For the first time, we've got David Spade coming in.  Whoa.  That's pretty cool.  Rich Voss used to know David Spade.  He tells me pretty much every time I hang out with him.  What do you mean?  In what capacity?  They used to hang out.  They came up together a little bit, so I can't wait to ask David Spade if this is true.  He'll be like, uh...  I've heard of him from Rich Voss.  No, I've never heard of him.  Or he'll go like this.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, that guy.  Yeah, that guy. 
[00:39:00]  Sure, yeah.  He'll be polite about it.  And then we've got Charlie Day from Pacific Rim.  Yeah, it's big.  Pacific Rim?  No, Charlie Day.  Come on.  Pacific Rim looks like it's going to be a big hit.  Who saw Pacific Rim?  Huh?  Somebody I know saw Pacific Rim.  Saw it?  Yeah.  It's a movie, right?  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, we should know that by now.  If he's coming in in an hour.  We should know that by now.  Oh, no, when he said saw it, it's not like I was...  It's the aliens attack, and they're huge.  Yeah.  Big aliens.  It's like, we can't fight these fucking things. 
[00:39:30]  It's like an alien tornado.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Exactly.  So they're competing with Sharknado?  Sharknado.  Somebody on Twitter said...  Oh, no.  A storm of sharks.  Chad!  Well, if you'd let me tell you...  Three days on Twitter.  That's funny, man.  Can we play the Chad clip, please?  Chad!  And we also have, oh, God, James Cromwell.  Yes.  At 9.30, who was...  Stretch Cunningham.  Yes. 
[00:40:00]  And many more.  He was in...  Yes.  But you know him as soon as you see him.  He was in Babe.  Babe.  He was the farmer in Babe.  The farmer in Babe.  Yeah.  And that was...  He came on the after show, right?  Yes.  And I heard he was amazing.  He was great.  He was great.  I listened to that interview.  I can't wait to meet him.  He's tremendous.  Oh, you're such a creep in American Horror Story.  Did you see season two of that show?  Oh, no, I didn't.  He was like a weird Nazi doctor doing experiments.  Oh, wow.  I could see him doing that.  With teeth.  It was crazy.  Did you see the show?  Yes, I did.  Okay.  He was pulling out teeth and shit. 
[00:40:30]  Oh.  Am I right?  Yeah, it just seems like an obvious observation to me.  Was I right?  Yeah.  Am I wrong?  Probably pulled out a tooth somewhere on the season short.  See, now they're stretching the Iraq bit.  They just came up with the onion ring.  Like his shirts.  The onion ring?  Yeah.  Oh, like the ring.  B-Rock, that's not fair.  I would not allow that.  That's not cool.  That's not cool at all.  Okay.  That wasn't bad, though.  It's like the ring.  The onion ring.  But we're doing sci-fis. 
[00:41:00]  Yeah, that's more a little hard.  So that's not fair.  We're not going to make believe you didn't hear that.  All right.  Make sure the jury didn't hear that one, okay?  We're not going to allow that.  That could be a sci-fi movie, though.  Yeah.  Good morning, Joe.  I was talking about Sharknado.  Sharknado is heading toward the airport.  I'm telling you, it's all the rage.  They're playing the trailer.  This is you.  All right.  So this film comes from the production company that has brought us certain hits, like Mega Shark  versus Giant Octopus.  That starred Debbie Gibson and Lorenzo Llamas. 
[00:41:30]  You'll remember Lorenzo from Falcon Crest fame.  Yes!  Mega Shark versus Crocosaurus, starring Urkel from Family Matters, and the two-headed shark  attack starring Playboid Centerville.  You think Mika's going to have a problem with this break?  Yeah.  Mika's going to have a problem.  Can I catch all of this shark?  Look at all the guys.  Joe, it's funny that you ask, because you can catch all the shark-tastic action tonight  when Sharknado premieres on sci-fi.  What is that? 
[00:42:00]  I know what I'm doing this weekend.  She doesn't mean to get it.  You know what I'm doing this weekend.  M-S-M-E-C and Sci-Fi are both owned by Universal.  That's good, right?  I know.  Yeah, that is great.  And that's the only news you can't use.  Where's the picture?  Well, we're going to get the picture.  Why are we saying, Jim?  When the Sharknado actually happens, what you should do is just let the shark flop around  until it dies.  What the fuck?  Did it listen to us?  Hey, Jimmy.  Let it flop around and it dies.  Jim's a veteran of many...  I've been through Sharknado.  You're right.  People love this Sharknado thing. 
[00:42:30]  It's a phenomenon.  Everybody associated with this show has to watch it.  It's a phenomenon.  This reminds me of the movie I wrote.  Oh, what was that called?  It was called Shark Clits.  Where there are tiny sharks that hide under clit hoods.  And then when you go to Licky Girl's clit, it bites your gums.  It runs away.  That's terrible.  They should make bad sci-fi porno movies like that.  Well, I think every older porno movie is like that. 
[00:43:00]  They're just horrible, bad stories.  But never Shark Clit.  No, never Shark Clit.  I would definitely watch Shark Clit.  Fuck yeah.  Although there was that movie where that chick had teeth in her vagina.  It was, yeah.  What was that called?  Teeth?  I think it was just called Teeth.  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  How about Octopekka?  No.  It's got eight Peckas and it fucks all the girls.  Yeah, you'd really like that, wouldn't you?  Yeah, fuck all the girls with eight Peckas.  That's not what I was talking about.  Peckas.  You don't think Octopekka would be good? 
[00:43:30]  No, I don't.  I don't think it would be good at all.  You guys want to hear a new E-Rock bit?  I certainly do.  Yes, it is.  As long as it doesn't make fun of him.  Yeah.  It's a Ricky Gervais bit.  No, it's E-Rock.  Starring E-Rock.  He acts in it.  Huh?  He breaks out some of his acting chops.  Oh.  Yes.  Along with the pork ones.  Did you know this, E-Rock?  E-Rock? 
[00:44:00]  Oh, E-Rock.  E-Rock?  I was letting them laugh.  Thank you, E-Rock.  That's very nice.  Thank you for seeing me, Doctor.  I've been having problems with weight gain recently,  and I think I might have caught obesity.  That's not a disease.  Obesity is not a disease.  Let's stop.  Let's nip that one in the bud.  98% of all obese people are because they ate too much  and they didn't do enough exercise.  Under 2% are through things like some thyroid problems, 
[00:44:30]  some cancer drugs.  Okay?  And they all say it's, I've got a, no, no, no, no.  Well, I'm not on any drugs, but I think this is probably a sickness.  98% of fat people is because they ate too much.  So let's, that's, that's done.  That one's done.  Uh, Doctor, if I may be frank,  your bedside manner could use a little work.  Eat less and do more exercise.  Next.  Doctor, I don't want to leave the office.  I'm addicted to food.  Who isn't addicted to food?  What animal is not addicted to food? 
[00:45:00]  I'm addicted to air.  I keep breathing in and then I breathe out.  And I take the oxygen in my alveoli.  I take what I need to get into my red blood cells.  And I, I, I, then I, then I, then I adjust CO2.  I'm addicted to it.  Of course you are.  I just need some help.  I have a problem.  You have to be addicted to, it doesn't count.  There's no sex addiction.  All these people that go, oh, so I'm addicted to sex.  That means you got caught and now you're going to go in the priory for a week.  That's all it means.  There's no, you're not addicted to sex and food and air and water. 
[00:45:30]  It's ridiculous.  Ah, fuck it.  It's lunch time.  Oh.  Wow.  Wow.  Good acting, Nerox.  That is amazing.  Very good acting.  What was the food you ate at the end?  To make pretzels.  Pretzels.  Oh, I thought that was the floor.  You walked out. 
[00:46:00]  That is amazing.  Good job, Art.  Thank you.  Yeah.  Very nice.  Didn't we make fun to what Tucker Max's face with the drops and stuff?  Dude, you, yeah, it was, um.  We did, right?  We did it when he left, but while he was there, it's one of the most uncomfortable things I've  ever had to sit through because you kept hitting that clip.  Liar.  Liar!  You're a liar!  He had his headphones on. 
[00:46:30]  I think they might have been off.  He left.  No.  He left in tears.  But that might have been the joke.  Because he continues his lies.  Yeah.  Did you read this thing?  I did not, no.  That someone tweeted yesterday?  No.  If you don't know, podcast number nine is up with Tucker Max's appearance.  We just didn't believe him.  And the old McDonald's employee that Anthony fired.  He had a farm.  Huh?  Oh, Jesus.  This is an old clip. 
[00:47:00]  Let me see this clip.  Wow.  This is Tucker Max's.  This is the actual Tucker Max's in-studio.  How long is it?  Four or five minutes.  All right.  It's on the podcast.  You don't want to play it, right?  I don't care.  Yeah, like, I was maybe 20, 21.  I was spending a summer in Florida when I was in college.  And I met this one girl.  She's really high.  And I had never tried butt sex before.  He doesn't even believe the story he's about to tell.  If you know anything about body language, he's looking down. 
[00:47:30]  He's a little nervous.  He's praying that we're going to buy his lie, in my opinion.  Oh, my thing with him is, because I liked him when he was in.  He was fun.  He was like, he was interesting.  But then it just got to that one point.  There was something he said where all three of us just went, we started looking at each other.  And it just became like, oh.  Oh, come on, dude.  Like, we were enjoying it.  Yeah.  It's almost like if someone is just talking to you like you're a dope and you're not going to catch on.  Yeah, and it's like an insult to me. 
[00:48:00]  When someone sits there and they're bullshitting so badly, it's like, do you honestly think I'm dumb enough to believe this shit?  Right.  Yeah.  So he's telling this story of how he never had butt sex before.  And listen to this story.  He wanted to.  So I kept trying to convince this girl.  And she wouldn't.  She's like, no, I don't know.  And so I finally convinced her.  I'm like, look, you know, it's like she wanted to be a runway model.  That's why she was living in South Beach.  I was in Florida at the time.  And I'm like, you know, it's what all the models do, blah, blah, blah.  And so I finally convinced her by convincing her that, like, it was what it was like the European way to have sex. 
[00:48:30]  This is like the level of intelligence in this girl.  And, like, I'm kind of an asshole now, but I was possibly the worst person on earth at this point in my life.  So what I hadn't told her was that my buddy and I decided that since this is going to be the first time I had butt sex, that I wanted to videotape it.  Right?  But instead of just, like, setting up, like, a camera.  This is, like, nine years ago.  So it was before, like, you know, like, really cheap cameras.  We had, like, one of the, like, the sort of shoulder ones.  The camera.  Right.  That had, like, the VHS.  Sort of like that, except the cracky version. 
[00:49:00]  Right, right.  And so my buddy hid in the closet with the camera and was going to film us.  Like, so he was hanging out at my place and then, you know, he saw us pull up and then he was going to go run in the closet and hide.  And so I was so shit-faced by the time that I got back.  At this point I had pretty much forgotten that he was in there.  Oh.  So we go in.  We start kissing, whatever.  Everything's going great for a while.  And, you know, we start going harder and harder.  And she's more into it and I'm more into it.  And, like, I'm right about to come and, you know, I'm slamming hard, coming way in and out.  And I come out too far and I kind of, like, you know, I come out and I, like, you know, hit her butt or something. 
[00:49:30]  So I go down to put myself back in and all of a sudden I feel this, like, warm splash on my hand.  And I'm, like, the lights are kind of low.  So I look down and it's, like, kind of dark.  And I'm, like, wait a minute.  And then the smell hits me.  Now this could happen.  Up till this point.  It's a good, like, ass fuck shit story or something.  I feel there's some lies in there.  But I feel like he was pumping up his story a little bit. 
[00:50:00]  But we were accepting it at this point.  I didn't have any disbelief in that.  Like, because I fucked girls.  I remember one of my girlfriends years and years ago, I pulled my dick out.  And it looked like I was making, like, a chocolate treat out of my cock.  I had to towel off my dick.  Oh, God.  But, I mean, this is not unbelievable.  No, up to this point, we're into it.  You know, if he's embellishing, it's fine.  He's trying to sell a book and everything.  We get it.  We're not total morons. 
[00:50:30]  But he reaches a point where it's, like, oh, gosh.  Yeah.  That's why I love this.  Yeah.  Because there's a point where the wheels absolutely fall off.  Yeah.  And then we're all uncomfortable.  Like, really, dude?  It was, like, dying out loud.  You can't have the time of his life.  You can't have the time of his life in this interview.  Oh, he's laughing.  He's into it.  Oh, my God.  He's loving it.  That was funny.  Oh, God.  Fucking mix of, like, diarrhea and astroglide.  And so, like, the smell hits me.  And it was, like, oh, my. 
[00:51:00]  And then, of course, I'd be, like, shh, on my dick.  And then combine that with, like, the seafood and then two bottles of wine.  And I just, I blow all over her ass.  Like, in her asshole, everywhere.  And so, I'm throwing up.  And she's, like, kind of hammered.  And she's, like, kind of hammered.  She's, like, Tucker, what are you doing?  She sees me throwing up.  She goes, oh, my God.  She's, like, throwing up everywhere.  And so, I'm seeing her throwing up.  And it's making me throw up.  I'm throwing up more.  All of a sudden, true fucking story.  My fucking buddy falls out of the closet. 
[00:51:30]  He's, like, oh, my God.  Look at that.  Because he saw us and, you know, smelled it.  I mean, you can imagine the smell.  You know, it's, like, seafood and wine and astroglide and shit.  And he fucking is throwing up everywhere.  So, like, there's, like, a three-second period where all three of us are staring at each other, vomiting everywhere.  That video would be, like.  Pause.  I know.  You have no idea.  Pause, pause.  We all immediately.  Well, we went from laughing to, if you notice, there's a lot of points where we probably would have continued laughing.  No one's laughing anymore.  Because we're, like, what?  No, it's, like, that just didn't happen.  This is way over-the-top exaggerations. 
[00:52:00]  That never happened.  Right.  And then we're, like, oh, what about the videotape?  And that's what he says.  Like, yeah, that video would be amazing.  Imagine that video.  Oh, yeah.  Well.  I'm just saying I am.  I don't have that.  I know.  And so I was a little suspicious when he was telling the story because I'm wondering, you have to have the tape.  Yeah, dude.  It was, like, you remember the VHS, the big cameras where you put the VHS tape in?  He fell out and, like, you know, like, the little tape itself broke.  Of course, like, the magnet, you know, it's magnetized. 
[00:52:30]  We could have easily gone and changed it.  But it's, like, I didn't think, you know, it's, like, remember you said you don't write down your stories?  I didn't write this stuff down at 21.  I started writing it down at 27, you know?  And so I just didn't think about, like, oh, we should save this tape.  The tape was broke.  I was like, ah, fuck it.  Just whatever.  You know?  Pause.  It didn't occur to me that.  And I did call him out on it.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Who doesn't save that tape and just casually goes, ah, fuck this?  This tape is a little edited, I think.  You can see it's, like, Steve, because this is from Foundry.  Well, because it was a long appearance, so it's kind of the highlights, you know?  How would you not, even at that moment, it's, like, all three of us are throwing up. 
[00:53:00]  She's nude.  Shit on my dick.  All that shit he just said.  Right.  And this tape of it.  And you don't go, oh, my God, get that tape.  Yeah.  Sci-fi was broke.  Well, yeah.  Yeah, well, shit, Nato.  I fixed VHS tapes over the years for the dumbest, stupidest things.  Exactly.  But you got something like this that you filmed.  And he didn't even think about it.  And then he just, like, you know, his answer was like, ah, and we just went out, fuck it.  Really?  Yeah.  Fuck it?  Yeah.  Keep going. 
[00:53:30]  Like I was going to ever do any of this shit, you know?  If I had known I was going to become a writer, motherfucker, I would have, you know,  gone through hell and high water to say that.  Are you kidding?  I think people are a little pissed off because you don't have the videotape.  I think that's made a lot of people very uncomfortable, including everybody in this room.  Pause again.  I keep saying pause again because wait till you hear what he wrote about this incident.  More lies.  He wrote something.  Go ahead.  I mean, that's pretty clear. 
[00:54:00]  When you say including everybody in this room.  Right.  That's an acknowledgment.  I'm calling him out on it.  We all think you're lying.  Right.  You know?  Well, you get to miss Fell, I mean.  Not me.  Fell in what?  I don't need no fucking tape.  Absolutely.  It's uncomfortable.  My stories are hysterical.  I'm so uncomfortable there.  That's just anything uncomfortable.  Like, please, don't do this.  Not only that, if you remember.  Get the modern day tummy in.  Now, if you remember, this is classic good cop, bad cop, which we pulled constantly.  Right.  But I think there's also some uncomfortableness in there. 
[00:54:30]  Like, I don't know how far he's going to take this one.  This is codependent cop, bad cop.  Yeah.  No, honestly, honestly.  All right.  I will do this.  And, yeah, it's uncomfortable.  I know it's uncomfortable.  But you're playing the good cop?  The part is to keep him in there and keep him going.  Right.  I know where you're going at this point.  I got this.  I know you're going to fucking now disassemble this guy.  And I'll be like, I don't need a tape.  I think the stories are great.  And then he looks at me like, oh, okay. 
[00:55:00]  I got something in the room that's on my side.  I'm not going to just leave now.  And then, oh, he just dismantles him.  I don't know if I, well, let's see.  I don't remember.  Yeah.  Fucking shit.  If he's sitting on the bowl, the fucking log's coming out.  And some girl's sucking on his cock.  I don't need no tape.  I don't need no nothing.  That's funny shit.  That's right.  Absolutely.  All right.  Thank you, Tucker, Matt.  Tucker, thanks, Matt.  Thanks, Matt.  I hope they serve beer in hell as the New York Times bestseller.  Do you see Jim's face? 
[00:55:30]  Jimmy's like, oh, boy.  Because this videotape does not, unfortunately, there's more to it.  The liar clips where you're playing those liar clips.  You're a liar.  Yeah, yeah.  Well, the podcast has the long form of this, right?  Yep.  It has all the audio.  And this is also not the studio audio.  This is the room audio.  Right, right.  You can't hear the phone calls in this.  It's just TV.  And by the way, his headphones were on when I was hitting that liar clip.  So he literally heard everything. 
[00:56:00]  He took the headphones off just as he's leaving.  Right.  Yep.  All right.  Thank you, Tucker, Matt.  Tucker, thanks, Matt.  Thanks, man.  I hope they serve beer in hell as the New York Times bestseller.  Jimmy's like covering his face and laughing.  Thank you, sir.  Tucker, folks.  He couldn't get out of there fast enough.  All right.  That's good, good, good.  That old gag.  Remember that gag?  I threw the book at the door.  Oh, that's right.  Yeah.  And he turned around and saw you throw the book at the door, by the way. 
[00:56:30]  Whatever.  Because he had tears in his eyes when he was leaving.  Yeah.  Like, he was obviously like, this did not go well.  Which goes against what he wrote about this incident, which I'm about to read.  But I want to get to the end of the clip.  What happened?  He fell out onto the tape.  I didn't hear what happened to the tape.  What happened?  Because, like, that would be something he would want.  He said something about, you know, the old days where it was the big VHS tapes.  Yeah, the TVVHS.  And I fell out onto the tape.  And it broke the tape.  Yeah, then Monty Python stole it.  They sketched it.  Really?  Did they? 
[00:57:00]  Did they?  Wow, that's a horrible copy of that.  Yeah, it's a bad, because you also, he was, like, walking to the elevator.  You tried to call him.  Oh, yeah.  And Big Kev's ripping up his book.  Right.  The quality of the video is horrible, is what I'm saying.  What year was that?  2006?  That's got to be.  2005, either?  That's got to be six, seven years ago, easy.  Yeah, I think it was just 2005.  So, I don't know if this is his blog, his website, or whatever, but.  When's this from?  Somebody mentioned me on my Instagram.  Oh, okay. 
[00:57:30]  Said, this is what Tucker Maxx said about you guys.  What the fuck is up with this?  The question was, what happened to you on Opie and Anthony?  And Tucker Maxx writes, when I went on their show, they had never heard of me or read my book,  which I believe is the truth.  Yeah, we might have heard the name in passing, because he was getting, it was a best-selling book.  Yeah, but it was a basic book.  I mean, what were we supposed to, you know, what did we need to know for that?  I told a couple stories, and they didn't believe them, not because of any evidence, one way or the other, 
[00:58:00]  just because they are shock jocks, and calling bullshit is what they do.  You see, right, see, this guy, I will continue to say, Tucker Maxx is a liar, in my humble opinion.  He just lies about everything.  That is not one ounce of acknowledgement about how the story fell apart.  We were enjoying it until that one moment where we knew you were bullshitting.  Yeah, because you saved the tape.  I don't personally believe that all three of you were vomiting at once. 
[00:58:30]  And it annoyed me that you were doing that, instead of just kind of talking to us the way we have discussions.  It was a funny thing to say, but as soon as I realized, it's like realizing a comedian's doing a five-minute bit sitting next to you.  Like, oh, you fucking cock.  Right.  Yuck.  Calling bullshit is what they do, but not really, because calling bullshit normally means saying it to a person's face.  We did.  Oh, God.  We did.  Yes.  Instead of doing that, they cut my earphones and said shit about me that I couldn't hear. 
[00:59:00]  That is not true.  That simply is not true.  We don't have the technology for it.  Like, you don't have a button that turns off people's headphones.  Do you understand what I'm saying about this guy?  He's just a fucking liar.  We didn't, we didn't.  Because he's trying to justify the videotape.  Of course.  I couldn't hear.  I would say he's full of shit.  Even though I was in their studio and their huge bodyguard was in the room.  That was Big Kev.  He's just a friend of the show, you idiot. 
[00:59:30]  He's not a bodyguard.  They were still too cowardly to call me a liar to my face.  We were playing the lying clip as he had his headphones on.  And that was just the way we, you know, we decided to go with the beer.  Uh, everything negative they said was when my earphones were cut.  Sam.  It doesn't, we don't have the technology in the studio.  And everything they did, like, tearing up my book was after I left.  That part is true.  Mm-hmm.  I did throw the book pretty much at him. 
[01:00:00]  It hit the door as he was leaving.  It's a glass door.  I mean, you could see through the door.  It was plexiglass.  Right.  I knew they were being dipshits when I was there, but I had no idea they were calling me a liar  until I left the studio and saw the video.  That's not true.  I know that's what shock jocks do, but still, when Howard Stern, these guys always have to  go the Howard Stern route, uh, talk shit about someone, he does it to the person's face.  I don't know why One are too cowardly to do what Stern does, but whatever.  That's their issue, not mine. 
[01:00:30]  So he continues with his lies.  Whatever.  So, uh, that's part of this week's podcast.  I think we sold some, uh, downloads.  The entire thing, yeah.  Yeah.  Not sold, because you don't have to pay for a podcast, but podcast number nine is the  whole Tucker Max appearance.  Yeah, you looked at him right in the face and said, uh, everybody in this room is uncomfortable  with your story.  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah, he's just lying.  I mean, even if his headphones were turned off.  Which, which they weren't.  That's impossible.  We can't do it.  Even, you, the words came out of your mouth. 
[01:01:00]  Right.  Five feet away from him.  We have times, we have times in the studio where the headphones don't work, you could still  hear the person.  Yeah, exactly.  You could still hear the person.  What is he talking about?  You can't turn off individual, a person can turn off their own headphones.  We don't have, oh, he doesn't have master controls of every.  No.  You, you, you control your own volume.  That's it.  He's an asshole.  Anyway.  Well, that was sent out yesterday.  It just so happened on the day that, uh, the podcast came out with, with his appearance. 
[01:01:30]  So, go check it out for yourself.  Fucking guys.  Just watching that gave me douche chills again.  Really?  And then we went, he's so into it.  And then, he starts, and then.  Really?  Yeah, because I've been in parties with people like that, or, you know, you're just around,  and they just start saying bullshit.  Right.  He rocks.  For a while, he used to see them on all those man stations, like Spike TV, and when FX was 
[01:02:00]  early on, when it had man-based programming, he was, like, on every one of those things,  telling all his stories, just as douchebaggy as this.  Yeah, good for the people that, you know, thought that would make good TV, I guess.  Hey, uh, Roland, why didn't we get anyone from Sharknado?  Well, um, because, uh, oh, they're coming next week.  Part two.  Part two.  I can't do your laugh tonight, my fucking throat hurts. 
[01:02:30]  You good?  Yeah, it's an Emory Tucker Max, and I had to walk him to the elevator, he was really crying,  calling his publicist.  He was crying.  So he knew.  Because he wrote that he said he didn't know until he saw the video.  No, he knew.  And now there's two people saying he had tears in his eyes.  And I said he had tears in his eyes.  He said, assholes, and then the elevator was shut.  I ran out there with the phone and tried to get back on there.  Right, yeah.  He was calling his publicist, like, right away.  Right.  Yeah, if he thought it was all copacetic, he probably would have been like, oh, the guys  want me back on the air, sure. 
[01:03:00]  Yeah.  Right.  I'll come back on.  We didn't go into that going, we're going to trash this guy.  No.  We were actually in.  We were all in, and then the story got so fucking over the top ridiculous, we couldn't  take it anymore.  Come back in, they want to talk to you, and he goes, no, no.  Right.  Douche.  Yeah.  So douchey.  All right, we got David Spade today.  Charlie Day.  Ooh.  Always sunny in Philly.  Great show on FX, but he's coming in for Pacific Rim, right?  Yeah, he smells like bacon. 
[01:03:30]  Big role on Pacific Rim?  Yeah.  For Charlie Day?  Yeah.  Him and Idris Elba.  Oh, can we get him?  He's in September for his Luther show.  Oh, and I loved it.  It's fucking Stringer Bell.  Yeah.  And James Cromwell at 930.  Mm-hmm.  And we didn't get Michael Cera yesterday.  No, it's not.  No fault of yours, Roland, so don't worry about it.  It's just, um, his manager felt that it was in the right foot.  That's all he said would be.  He felt that the right foot.  Michael Cera was not in the right foot of the show.  I guess it was right for him to get his ass eaten in the fucking, I fucking hate these  managers. 
[01:04:00]  And then he comes in after.  I mean, I'm glad Rodney Fez did something with him, but it's just like.  Wait, how did they get him?  That was the one.  It's the Ron Bennington interviews.  It's the right fit.  Oh, he did the Ron Bennington interview.  Yeah, the Ron.  I wonder if the fucking.  He did everybody.  Yeah.  He did everybody but us.  So what's that about?  Mashup?  Yeah.  Mashup, E-W.  We had a mom when he was a nobody.  Yeah, well, that's why these fucking pussy actors.  Once they do that shit, we should never have them back.  Holy shit. 
[01:04:30]  And he had a good time with us.  Yeah, we had a mom for Superbad.  Yeah, Superbad when no one knew what Superbad was yet.  At K-Rock, right?  Yeah.  It's him and McLovin.  Yeah, whatever.  Yeah.  It gets exhausting.  Oh, it's the worst.  It gets exhausting.  It's the worst.  Fuck them.  Exactly.  Them, their publicists.  Not one ounce of loyalty from these fucking cunt publicists or these shitty actors.  Fuck them.  Shithead actors.  I can't say he's a shitty actor.  This is a manager.  Because he doesn't have a publicist.  Oh, but you know what I'm saying. 
[01:05:00]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Whatever it is.  Yeah.  What was the problem, you think?  We're too edgy for him?  No.  I guess you said the film wasn't the right...  I mean, the film company was pushing for him to come on.  Yeah, the manager was full of shit.  The film company fought for us.  What is it?  The film company said, no, no, you're wrong.  This isn't a perfect fit.  They're just...  But that's just all lies, because let's say you have a project, and you're in the building.  It's not like he has to now travel an hour just to talk to us.  We're right down the hall, so don't you think you're going to pick up some people that will 
[01:05:30]  watch his film just because he's on our show?  Yeah.  What is he talking about?  It's not the right fit.  That's the dumbest...  Yeah, because it's a small indie film, too.  That's the dumbest excuse ever.  And the last thing they would want is to expose it to an audience.  Make money.  Yeah, why would you want to do that?  Old school radio, these guys had to drive all over town to do all their interviews.  Now they come in the building, and boom, boom, boom, one place right down the hall.  So how could it not be the right fit?  You do five, ten minutes with us, and you're going to turn somebody on to the fucking movie, 
[01:06:00]  no?  Yeah.  Fuck them.  Fuck them.  Never again.  We just turned a shitload of people on to Sharknado.  Yeah.  Joe McKellar was doing a month about that.  Really?  Yeah, it was Sharknado month.  Sharknado month.  Did you talk to his manager yourself?  Everything was done by the studio.  She was saying to talk to the studio.  The manager's a she?  Yeah.  And she's...  Yeah.  They're just out of touch. 
[01:06:30]  They don't know their shit.  They're stupid.  She wouldn't even talk to you if she said talk to the studio?  That's what most of them do.  The studio's handling the schedule.  I fucking hate them.  That's the...  Right?  They're hateable.  Hateable.  Yeah, we're going to talk about Justin Bieber next.  That'll make everybody happy.  And book reports.  Yeah, we got to do a book reports.  Abso-fucking-lutely.  The O.P. and Anthony Show.  Sirius XM. 
[01:07:00]  Sirius XM.  This is the O.P. and Anthony Show.  Do-do-do-do-do.  Do-do-do-do-do-do-do.  What about this one, Jimmy?  The Hope.  Yeah, it's all right. 
[01:07:30]  I mean, it's just not my...  I don't love it.  Summertime Blues.  Oh, yeah.  Released back in 1970.  70, huh?  1970.  They took this at Woodstock.  It's 69.  The drumming's very good.  Yeah. 
[01:08:00]  How's the drummer these days?  What's he up to?  Still, uh...  You still drumming?  Sure.  Nice.  He's doing good.  It had an interesting sound to it, the drums.  Yeah.  Like a weird...  Keep going ruled.  Just ask Scott Muni.  Oh, that's right.  We can't.  We used to ask Scott Muni, though.  Did he know these guys?  Oh, God.  He knew them all.  It's very interesting to watch him drum.  Really?  A weird style.  Cute move.  Yeah. 
[01:08:30]  Why do we play our rock music so low on this channel?  Because it's very loud, and it's so early in the morning.  Why don't we just settle down?  Before we do book reports, can we see the Justin Bieber video?  I still haven't seen it.  It finally made mainstream news today.  They're all talking about the beeps.  It's amazing that this is news in this country.  Talking about the beeps.  What did he do?  He peed in a bucket or something there, Sam Roberts? 
[01:09:00]  Yeah, he was in a restaurant.  He took a piss in a bucket.  They all said, like, we're the wild kids or something like that.  Oh, they're just crazy.  And then there was a picture of Bill Clinton on the wall, and he sprayed some Windex and  said, fuck Bill Clinton.  That's crazy.  Oh, really?  He's a wild man.  Why is he doing this?  Because he's fucking crazy.  He's Justin Bieber, you know?  He's not controllable.  He's off the hook now.  Off the chain, really.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  Fucking crazy.  That's right, Chip.  What did Harvey have to say about this?  What question did he ask?  Yeah, what did he have to say? 
[01:09:30]  What question did Harvey ask?  Or what did he have to ask?  Justin out of control?  What did Harvey say?  He obviously knew he was being filmed, right?  Yeah, it was his friend filming him.  Yeah.  What did Harvey say?  Well, this is his opinion on it.  All right.  Harvey Levin from TMZ.  Yeah.  Justin Bieber pisses into a restaurant mop bucket.  Fuck Bill Clinton.  Jerk move or harmless fun?  What does that even mean? 
[01:10:00]  That's what he jerk move.  Why doesn't he ever give his own opinion on his Twitter?  Just a fucking...  What has he got on the Honey Boo Boo at the top there?  Oh, I'll let you know.  Honey Boo Boo returns with season two, scratch and sniff stunt.  Yeah.  Do you think it's a good way to gain viewers?  Why slash why not?  Why, why not?  Here's no question, though.  What?  Drake selling his Toronto condo for 4.2 million.  Join the conversation.  Join the conversation! 
[01:10:30]  About what?  Who gives a fuck?  What could you possibly converse with somebody?  Does he like the Blue Jays?  I don't know.  Maple Leafs.  Wonder what street he's looking at.  Yeah.  He really has the worst Twitter out there.  Oh, it stinks!  Who cares, Honey Boo Boo did a scratch and sniff?  And what is it supposed to smell like?  Armpits?  What smell are they going for?  It's a bunch of different smells, and I guess when a little thing pops up, you're supposed  to sniff the appropriate numbered spot. 
[01:11:00]  Oh!  You get like a little smell of what's going on.  Do you think it's a good idea?  Let's discuss.  Why slash why not?  Please answer in complete sentences only.  Do we get to smell the bug toe?  Show your work.  Do we get to smell the bug toe?  No?  Yes.  Little Honey Boo Boo is so fucking fat.  Oh, she's disgusting.  She's so fat.  She's a little piglet.  Yeah.  What else?  Any other questions while we...  Yeah, of course.  Yeah.  Elizabeth Hasselbeck.  Peace, View. 
[01:11:30]  Do you think she will make a good addition to Fox News?  Oh, God.  Why would they hire her?  She's dumb.  Yeah.  She's fucking dumb.  Yeah, she's going to get her ass handed to her.  Same reason they hired Palin.  And it's like, stop going for these fucking big names because they're attractive women.  Well, she obviously leans that way, but she's going to get her ass handed to her on Fox.  Are you kidding me?  Maybe they'll just give her the fucking easy shit.  Well, she's going to be Fox and Friends in the fall.  Are they getting rid of the other blonde?  I don't know.  Because I think the two guys are staying. 
[01:12:00]  Yeah.  And she's joining.  Unless they're just adding her to the cast.  So are we using Harvey's Twitter to make fun of, or are we using it for show prep?  I know, right?  Look at us.  This is girls' time.  We're cutting into it.  Disgusting.  Are we just...  Cutting into the girls' time.  Well, Elizabeth Hasselbeck, she said goodbye yesterday.  Was it good?  No, it was long.  Yeah.  And what was she saying?  She was just talking about...  Is she meandering?  The positive impacts that everybody has made on her life.  Like what?  Whoopi Goldberg is a wonderful person, and the cast, I mean the crew mic'd her up properly, 
[01:12:30]  and Barbara Walters has taught her so much she's ready to interview politicians.  Wow.  Really?  That's great.  Trite idiocy.  And even though her and Joy didn't always agree, she always had the utmost respect for Joy.  Of course she did.  And even appreciated Joy's one-liners.  Oh, wow.  That's terrific.  The zingers?  The zingers.  Yeah.  You like that, Jimmy?  I'm happy for her.  Yeah, it's great news. 
[01:13:00]  It's all nonsense out there, isn't it?  Garbage.  All utter garbage.  It's nonsense.  No, Barbara has prepared her to be a real political journalist and analyst.  All right, good.  Can't wait.  Not just some chick who used to be on Survivor.  Right.  Wow, Fox and Friends are the last show to interview the trick shot kid.  Trick shot Titus.  Oh, for the Lord.  That's like his.  No.  Marvelous.  Watch, he misses every other shot.  Oh, wow.  Make the basket, Opie.  He made that one. 
[01:13:30]  Oh, and it's 7-Eleven Day.  Oh, shit, it's Slurpee Day.  7-Eleven Day.  Slurpees.  And there you go, Ed.  He's getting involved.  He's involved.  That's your bit.  The anchor's the guy, the host.  He's out there serving up some Slurpees in a big Slurpee truck.  Are they handing out Slurpees downstairs?  It's right out there.  Yeah, it's like right out the door.  So why don't you get a few?  We're going to send a boy intern down.  Yeah, I want a Slurpee.  You do?  It would help my throat right now.  I've got everybody's Slurpees.  Oh, good.  A nice one Slurpee texture.  How big are the Slurpees this year? 
[01:14:00]  Oh, my God.  Do you remember last year?  They're a bit chintzy on their Slurpees on a free Slurpee Day.  Oh, the free Slurpee.  That's like a little cup.  Oh, come on.  I want a big gulp cup.  Really, man?  The tits on this girl in the bra ad.  Jesus Christ.  Where?  It went away.  It just went away, I know.  Oh, so Justin Bieber.  Yes, the video.  Oh, right, right.  Is he on the drug, Sam?  I think he's definitely smoking a lot of weed.  He's doing weed?  I think.  I don't have any actual evidence. 
[01:14:30]  Is he just out of control in this video?  He's trying so hard to be the bad boy is what it is.  Right.  Oh, God.  Wait, real quick.  This was my picture from Slurpee Day last year.  Jesus.  It fits in the palm of your hand.  I have feminine hands, as it is.  Yes, and everything else.  Yeah.  And fucking stomach and legs.  Don't attack me.  I'm not complimenting you, stupid.  But he grows a beard in an hour.  It's really strange.  Yeah.  I don't shave all the way. 
[01:15:00]  That's about four ounces, I would say.  If that.  If that, right?  They give you four ounces.  Four ounces of Slurpees.  It's a Dixie cup.  Yeah, yeah, it is.  They give you a Dixie cup and say, go ahead, buddy, fill it up, whatever you want.  You know what?  Someone has to say it.  Fuck 7-Eleven.  Yeah?  Yes.  If you're going to give out free Slurpees, give out some free Slurpees.  Do it right.  You know how cheap it is to make a Slurpee?  I don't know.  It's cheaper than a beverage.  Exactly.  Let me see Justin Bieber pee.  Here's Justin Bieber peeing in the mop bucket. 
[01:15:30]  He's one of the wild kids.  Oh, he's crazy.  What is a wild kid?  It's a kid who pees in a bucket.  That's a hay for you, man.  Quick little piss break, you know?  Quick restaurant we can get to.  We swagger, man.  You know, this is just a bad spot to piss.  We the wild kids.  That's the coolest spot to piss.  You know, if I ever remember that.  We the what?  You're not going to, you're not going to, you're not going to remember him pissing in the 
[01:16:00]  restroom.  Like, everybody does that.  Yeah.  What are we, though, bro?  Why is this news?  What are we?  It's not.  Wild kids, yo!  Wild kids!  Wild kids, it is b***h!  Wild kids, it is b***h!  This is wild.  That's wild.  He sprayed Windex on the picture.  Oh, my God.  Look out.  That's just awful.  That was really embarrassing.  It's a non-story.  Oh, that is f***ing douchey.  That was great.  He then issued an apology to Bill Clinton.  Yes, yes. 
[01:16:30]  Oh, of course.  Why wouldn't he?  Didn't he really?  Yeah.  He tweeted an apology.  I thought you were a wild boy.  Yeah, wild guys don't apologize.  They never apologize.  No, that's crazy.  What was the apology?  How douchey was that?  Oh, fuck.  There's probably some cunty publicist who thought it would be a good idea.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  I don't apologize.  I better apologize.  He called Bill Clinton.  What?  And Bill Clinton picked up the phone.  That's the main problem.  Why would he pick up the phone?  Justin, did you say f*** me? 
[01:17:00]  Oh, God.  He tweeted, thanks for taking the time to talk, Mr. President.  Your words meant a lot.  Hashtag great guy.  Hashtag great guy.  Why do they want me involved in this?  Is that your hashtag?  Of course.  He couldn't just write, he's a great guy.  She was just staring at me.  Like I'm a retard.  It was just so funny. 
[01:17:30]  I'm a great guy.  Why do they want me involved?  Great guy.  Anthony Cumi.  Not a great guy.  No, especially on the Twitter.  Neither of those things.  Jesus.  All right.  Let's do the book report.  Oh, yeah.  Where are the ladies?  So what happened?  We finally realized that our interns are really, really young and that they don't know a lot  of the shows that we certainly know.  Yeah, that we grew up with and whatnot.  So we talked about some of those shows and they just were shaking their heads like they don't 
[01:18:00]  have a clue.  And we picked a show.  We picked Quincy.  Quincy.  We picked an episode of Quincy.  What was the name of the episode again?  Yeah, it was about the prostitute.  But what was the name of the episode?  It was Sully, be thy name.  Say.  But a hooker who lands a plane.  You got a sore throat today, too?  It's just, my voice just went away.  I don't know what happened.  Whoa.  Yeah.  Are you zooted?  Were you screaming or anything? 
[01:18:30]  Yeah.  I was.  I just woke up.  Yesterday, it was even worse than this.  My throat hurts pretty much.  But I think it's just from doing Don West yesterday, doing the Don West voice.  My throat hurts, too.  Why?  I just wanted to be part of the group.  Just to be one of the guys.  So you guys watched Quincy and you had to write a book report.  Yeah.  A typical book report.  It's little pieces of notebook paper.  It's on a loose sleeve with proper headings.  It's like the fucking note that was left at JonBenet's murder scene. 
[01:19:00]  And there's a third book report here.  Yeah.  What is this about?  I mean a third.  We have two interns.  I made it clear.  Oh, we have two interns, right?  Yeah.  It's incorrect.  What?  There's a boy intern.  Oh, there is?  Oh, yes.  What's his name again?  Let me check the paper.  Trayvon?  He didn't write his name on his assignments.  What is it?  Jerry.  Five points off.  It's Jerry?  It's Jerry, I guess.  Yeah, it was made clear to him that he, in no way, shape, or form, had any book report assignment 
[01:19:30]  to do.  He was to go home and just...  Yeah, we never said, like, hey, you do it too.  No, sit home with your thumb up your ass.  You got nothing to do tonight.  What made him think he should, like, try to get involved?  I guess go-to-itiveness?  I don't know.  Well, we like that, don't we?  I like that.  Yeah.  Yeah, we like that.  Showing some gumption.  Showing some, I'm not getting attention.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah, he's desperate to be noticed.  Kenny, when he handed it to me, he made the mistake of doing it in front of Kenny, and 
[01:20:00]  Kenny goes, did you sign it, needy?  Kenny rules.  Yeah, so I have book reports turned in by Sidney, Jackie, and Jerry.  Jerry.  Jerry.  Very good.  Yeah.  Okay.  Where is Jerry?  He's getting Slurpees.  Instead of air time, he has to get free Slurpees for everybody. 
[01:20:30]  Slurpee day.  How great is that?  7-Eleven day.  Yeah.  So, ladies, you watched it and had to write a little book report on it.  Overall, what did you think?  How great?  It wasn't bad.  It was just a little slow.  A little slow?  A little 1970s, yeah.  Ah, yeah, a little 1970s-ish.  A little slow?  What are you talking about?  I read their book reports, and they both had the same observation of something that 
[01:21:00]  they did at the beginning of the episode that makes no sense and never happens anymore.  Oh, wow.  Yeah.  They did, like, instead of a recap, they did, like, a trailer instead.  What's going to happen?  So, I was watching it.  I was like, okay, so this is what happened in the last episode, and nothing got solved.  And as the episode went on, you realize that this is what you already saw.  They were showing what you were going to see.  Yeah.  Oh, right.  They used to do that, right?  They did, yeah.  Oh, I forgot about that. 
[01:21:30]  Why would they do that?  I didn't know, like, at the end, they were going to show and, like, do a recap of what  they just showed you.  I don't, I didn't know what was going on.  Yeah, they show, like, a prequel, a preview of the end.  Yeah.  It's really like a movie trailer of what you're about to watch.  A lot, though.  Yeah, they show a lot of that.  Like, they show you a lot.  It gives you a way.  You're like, oh, do I need to watch the episode?  Why would they do that?  How lame.  So, how should we handle this?  What other basic observations about the show?  The music was great.  Yeah, there's a lot of music. 
[01:22:00]  A lot of music.  It's way more suspenseful.  This is the opening theme.  Yeah, the opening theme where they're showing him, because he's a coroner, but he's also  a guy.  Yeah.  You know, so they show him doing his coroner work, but then he'll be out to dinner on a  date.  Yeah.  And then there he is in the medical examiner's office, and then there he's on his boat.  He's a devil-may-care jack-of-all-trades.  He really is.  Did you find him a good leading man for the show? 
[01:22:30]  Yeah, I asked you.  Yeah, you did?  Yeah.  I liked him.  You did?  Jack Klugman.  Do you think he was sexy?  I wouldn't go that far.  Jackie noticed something subtle that they did in the show.  Yeah.  In her book report, she writes, it was a tad dull and very predictable.  They showed their number one suspect in the scene right after the murder.  Literally, and they show him watching the news report of the murder.  So you're like, oh, I wonder who it could be now.  It's not even a whodunit kind of a thing. 
[01:23:00]  You just know.  No, you just know.  They're like, oh, did they move the body?  And then they show the guy who moved the body.  They really were catering to Simpletons.  Yeah.  But it ended without knowing if he was killed or if he just died.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  That made me really mad.  Were you going to read the book report?  I think we should have them read the book.  Yeah, yeah.  Why don't you read?  Absolutely.  Did they show the part where his assistant Sam attempts to land a plane in San Francisco?  All right. 
[01:23:30]  We should read it first, Sam.  What do you think?  Can we read Tyler's?  Let's start with Sidney's book report.  Oh, Sidney.  Yeah, you can do it.  Sidney.  Did you ever have to give, like, oral presentations in school?  I was vice president of my senior class.  Yeah?  I had to do a speech.  So you had to do a speech?  Yeah.  Oh, so this should be easy.  No.  No.  Did you get up, like, to give a speech at graduation or something? 
[01:24:00]  Oh, so was it one of these?  Was it one of these?  As we move along in our life and advance from this, we will remember the good times we had  here, but also take with us the knowledge that we, I hate a good graduation speech.  Yes.  As we end this portion of our lives, we begin anew.  This isn't the ending of something.  It's the beginning of our lives as an adult.  We came here as children, merely not knowing what... 
[01:24:30]  Oh, God, I hate those.  How many times did you say build or future?  Yes.  Mine was all about the song.  Like, we had the class song.  What was the class song?  It was some dumb Nickelback song.  I don't know why they picked it.  Really?  If the girls need any beverages...  Oh.  Tyler is here with Slurpees for everybody.  I have the cherry one, and I don't care.  I'm taking it.  What the hell is that? 
[01:25:00]  Those are almost big.  Hi, Tyler.  No, they're very, very small.  A little more than a taste.  Is this where you can bring your own, like, cup and fill up how much you want?  Yeah?  Down there?  I don't know.  Is that what it is?  I don't even know.  No?  Was there a line down there for the free Slurpees?  No.  None.  No.  Free Slurpee days.  I'm lost.  Did the Fox News get you on camera?  Shit.  I don't believe so.  There's Dr. Pepper Slurpees.  Whoa.  Yeah.  This is the greatest thing that's ever happened.  I thought that was pretty good.  We should send them down for more Slurpees. 
[01:25:30]  Yeah, I'm not turning your mic on.  Sorry.  This literally tastes like a cleaning product.  I'm not kidding.  This tastes like a cleaning product.  That's what you get for beans, so, like, I want that one.  I know.  Oh, wow.  She's right.  That's what you get, greedy.  What is it?  Cherry?  Yeah.  Doesn't taste good.  You said it tastes like a cleaning product.  It tastes like, it tastes like, like Tilex or something.  Oh, no.  I don't do Slurpees.  Could you drink Tilex so much that?  No.  The smell of it, you know, it gets you smarter. 
[01:26:00]  Give Slurpees to the ladies, too.  All the talent deserves Slurpees.  Oh, this is terrible.  We got strawberry lemon shade, Coke, sugar-free mango.  Give me the Coke one.  I'm not drinking.  He said he could go in there.  He shouldn't be talking.  I want the Coke one.  I want the Coke one.  Mango sounds kind of good.  Can I try a mango?  Sugar-free.  Yeah, I got that.  Is it sugar-free?  Which one you got?  Sugar-free mango.  What?  Mango is sugar-free?  Yes.  Did you just give that to Anthony?  No, he has Coke.  Oh, he has Coke.  Bring me a mango after you get that one, RJ, and then bring me one. 
[01:26:30]  No, no, no, I'm going to have one bite of it.  Give it to her, sweetie.  Oh, man, this kid's confused.  It's not doing well with the Slurpee challenge.  No, my health won't allow it.  I got to be honest with you.  I don't remember Slurpees tasting this shitty.  Really?  This is terrible Slurpee.  Coke Slurpees are the best.  Yeah, it's okay.  Yeah, right?  But, oh, my God, it's horrible.  Coke Slurpees are the best.  What did they do to Slurpees?  Mango is, like, sugar-free.  It needs the sugar.  Yeah, I would think so. 
[01:27:00]  What are you laughing at?  I don't know what he means.  I got a good one.  What do you mean?  What did he mean?  It's horrible.  Oh, I got a really good one.  Is it terrible?  No, it's really, really good.  Let me have that straw.  I'll just take it.  I love mine.  It's so gross.  Cindy, what's yours?  I'm going to scoop out one taste.  Which one you got?  It's like strawberry lemonade or something.  Oh, that sounds good.  It's terrible.  It is good.  When do these Dr. Pepper Slurpees get invented?  That sounds great.  It's blowing my mind.  Of course it does.  Can I scoop out one taste of yours? 
[01:27:30]  Absolutely.  I wish you were drinking a Dr. Kevorkian Slurpee.  No?  Oh.  No.  You're right and ants right.  It tastes like cleaning products, but it's not bad.  Not bad, yeah.  Dr. Kevorkian Slurpee.  Dr. Pepper.  Enough of you.  He's hooked up in the woods in the back of a fucking hatchback.  Laying there on a pillow. 
[01:28:00]  Oh, shit.  Not bad.  Were you bummed that you had to spend time watching Quincy?  I had to get a little motivation.  Oh, yeah?  You had a little motivation?  Because I tried to start with the first episode, and then I was like, oh, I'm just going to watch the one dance.  I'm sorry.  No.  Good.  That should have been the 4th of July assignment.  12 Quincy episodes in eight days.  God damn.  No camping for you.  That would have been very mean. 
[01:28:30]  Let's do their book reports, because we're going to run into David Spade time.  He's coming in in about a half hour.  Okay.  Sydney.  Sydney.  Sydney.  You gave a speech once.  Just read it?  Yeah, but what's the meaning of that?  Yeah, and we'll question you as you, you know, read it.  Maybe on some of the...  Well, I start off with, like, an introduction.  Okay.  Just read it from the top.  Yeah.  Yeah.  The show started with what I had originally thought was a recap, but later realized it  was actually a sneak preview.  You said that.  I know.  You said that.  Oh, my God. 
[01:29:00]  That's Jesus.  Let's see.  I said, as with any televised program, the theme song was a treat, but mostly because it  formed an idea on who Quincy was without even having to watch the whole episode.  Ah, yeah, see?  That's what I was saying.  You know, he's the working guy, but then he's just regular.  Exactly.  Yeah.  Let's see.  I'll go into the summary of the show.  We'll move on.  Okay.  Monaghan called Quincy in the middle of the night to go to an apartment because he knew 
[01:29:30]  he was the right guy for the case.  A priest had died in the home of a prostitute, and it was now Quincy's job to find out how.  Wow.  The priest was Father Martin Terrell, a man known by the news to be an activist and a  rebel.  Oh.  Father Martin had a heart condition and had died from a heart attack.  Back in the lab, the cause of death was confirmed, but the lividity on Father Martin's body suggested  that although the cause was no question, the location was up for debate.  Lividity.  It was not murder.  So Sam, so he had to check if he had been having sex with the hooker, so somebody walked 
[01:30:00]  in and they caught Quincy with the dead priest's penis in his mouth.  Oh, God.  What are you doing?  I'm checking in for residue, Sam.  Vaginal residue.  It makes my mouth numb.  It's a unique flavor.  It gives me bleach breath.  Was it like that?  That didn't happen? 
[01:30:30]  I apologize.  They just moved on real quick.  They were like, nope, we can't prove if they had sex or not.  And then that was a significant challenge.  Yeah, yeah.  Well, that was back.  Yeah, that's a little too controversial.  A little wild.  Right.  You got to wash over that stuff.  But Quincy was arguing that they did have sex.  I found a cunt hair in his teeth, Detective Monaghan.  Easy, Quincy.  You can't prove it.  Detective Monaghan.  So what finally happened?  This is excellent.  Well done.  I like this.  It's like you're watching it, right? 
[01:31:00]  Yeah.  I don't even know where it was.  Oh, no.  The bullet.  Oh, no.  Yeah.  What is it?  Father Terrell had funded an orphanage and a halfway house.  It was also a heavy activist against a dude who wore a very large medallion and ran a porno magazine.  Oh, that's awesome.  I can't remember his name.  Al Goldstein?  It was a very stereotypical kind of, yeah, I don't know.  Yeah, big medallion porno magazine.  Monaghan went to the halfway house and met with the priest's attorney that was helping him fight against the porno guy to try and bring down his whole empire thing. 
[01:31:30]  And then he found out that just before Father Martin died, he was in a meeting with the porno guy discussing a future article that could ruin the priest.  The priest.  Right, right.  Oh, boy.  Discussing an affair or something with his lawyer.  So now he's, you know, he could get screwed on this one.  Yeah.  Yeah.  He could go down.  So now what happened?  And then, obviously, the conversation got rather heated.  And the porno guy claimed that Father Martin left with much aggravation. 
[01:32:00]  In the lab, Quincy finds that a reddish colored fiber was found in Father Martin's throat as part of his last breath.  A reddish colored fiber.  Uh-oh.  Aha!  That would explain why she was cranky.  Oh, God.  Yeah, we got it.  Period.  A reddish fiber.  Yeah, find a reddish fiber.  The moth or pupa.  Yeah, okay. 
[01:32:30]  Keep going?  Sure.  Please.  They go back to the office of the porno guy to gather a sample of his carpet, but it wasn't a match.  Sending them back at square one once again.  About the drapes.  And saying where Father Martin died and clearing a dead...  Oh.  Uh-oh.  Whatever.  No, no, wait, Cindy.  What happened?  Yeah, man.  Please.  Oh, setting them back in square one and saying where Father Martin died.  Okay.  Gotcha.  Monahan went back to talk to Father Martin's attorney one last time, and finally everything came together. 
[01:33:00]  Oh, good.  Yes.  Everything or everyone?  They're all standing just looking at Father Martin cranking.  And no one knew why.  Four men just jerking off.  Look at the feet of a dead priest.  That's a hell of an episode.  I don't know what we're doing, but it feels right, doesn't it?  It turned out that the priest's attorney was very close to the man who was representing the porno guy. 
[01:33:30]  During the argument between Father Martin and the porno guy, Father Martin had a heart attack and collapse.  In a panic, the guy who ran the porno magazine called his attorney, who then put the priest in his trunk, which had a red carpeted and TV, and was also the location of Father Martin's second heart attack.  Oh, man.  So they thought that would be...  Wait, he thought that would be a better idea than to call the ambulance.  Right.  Would be to put the priest in the trunk.  What the fuck?  That's in a spare tire? 
[01:34:00]  Makes no sense.  No.  The attorney was charged with negligent homicide, and I think other things that I remember.  Negligent.  Overall, this episode had a lot of twists and turns that didn't really matter at all, and a whole lot of cheesy one-liners.  Oh, you don't remember any of the one-liners?  I didn't bring my notebook.  I had to run down my notebook.  Oh, man.  I'm sorry.  I want to know what the one-liners were.  Yeah.  One was, now he's reading on my parade, or something like that.  Oh, that's a good one. 
[01:34:30]  P-chew, good one.  Shit.  He died with a cause, like Father Terrell, or something.  Right.  Oh, okay.  Yes.  Wow, okay.  Very concise.  Very nice.  Did we get green?  Usually when the insiders do book reports, they get bombarded with insults.  No, that was terrific.  The gals get an applause break.  Yeah, that was great.  But she got applause.  That was good.  I love story time.  That was more of a very concise report of that.  Not much of your basic opinion on the characters. 
[01:35:00]  I thought we just had to do like a summary.  Well, that's okay.  That's exactly what we wanted.  That's what we asked for.  So, I painted the picture of the episode, and then Jackie has all the opinions.  There you go.  We didn't have to remember.  Exactly.  Oh, that was very smart.  That is.  That is.  That is.  Just be redundant in the song.  Right.  Right.  How sexy is that?  Yes.  We thought about it.  It's so sexy the gals got together and watched Quincy.  What's sexier than that?  We're all sharing some wine and watching Quincy. 
[01:35:30]  Watching Quincy.  Things happen.  They fall asleep.  Exactly.  It's Jackie's turn.  All right.  Jackie, if you would.  And don't skip anything if it's the same stuff Sidney said.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  I don't think it's anything.  This show craves redundancy.  So, I thought it started kind of slow, but the plot was really interesting with the priest  and a prostitute.  How interesting is that?  Sure.  It was weird to see the clips of the episode before it started, but I don't know the last 
[01:36:00]  time I saw that, so.  There were a lot of suspenseful moments with insane camera angles and constant scene setting  music.  Like, what was an insane camera angle?  Like, they'd zoom up from up his face or in it to get, like, the dun-dun-dun.  All right, right.  I know, exactly.  How does his eyes?  Yes.  You know, all it's constant.  It was awesome.  Crazy.  They'd start, like, on a giant white thing.  You're like, oh, no.  They're all like, it's like a polar ice cap, and then it's just a piece of Quincy's dandruff  on his tie.  Exactly.  That's a close-up. 
[01:36:30]  And they pull back.  I said it was, like, a 1970 version of CSI without all the fancy stuff.  Oh, very good.  Very good.  Yeah, yeah.  That's a great observation, Sam.  So schmancy.  I said it was a little predictable, because they showed their number one suspect in the  scene right after the murder watching the news of the murder.  It was just straight-forward conversation, and I was super pissed that they ended the  show on a cliffhanger. 
[01:37:00]  Because they never said who would happen.  They never said.  I mean, I know.  I just want to be straightforward told.  I don't want to think for myself.  Yeah, they should have said it was murder.  He died.  Or, you know.  What is going on with the Slurpee guy?  I did think it was funny.  Why did you get more Slurpees?  We asked them to.  Yeah.  You wanted the mango?  Sorry.  Oh, Jim, you wanted the mango?  Well, I didn't care.  The mango turned out to be all right.  I'll try it.  Is that my mango?  It turned out all right.  Thank you.  There's no sugar, right?  Yeah, I believe not. 
[01:37:30]  Would you get another breeze flavor?  Uh-oh.  Uh-oh.  Terrible.  Yes, this is really great.  Sugar-free.  That's great.  This is kerosene and asshole hair.  It's delightful.  Was that it?  No, I said I thought it was funny how giant the remotes were back then.  Oh, that's a good observation.  Very good.  Because it was a huge block.  And also, when they showed the porno guy and his riches, he had the three small square TVs 
[01:38:00]  next to each other nowadays.  Oh, wow.  But I think that it was very good.  Yeah, that is pretty good.  Yeah, what happened?  Yeah.  I said, all in all, it wasn't a bad show, but I wouldn't choose to watch it again.  You wouldn't watch it again.  And I'm ready for the next show to watch.  Yeah.  Wow.  It's Quincy.  You know what?  Very concise.  I know.  Yeah, Sharknado.  Is that on there?  Because that was a little...  No, no, no.  No applause, though?  Well, yeah, of course.  Of course applause.  We were busy with our Slurpees, Sam. 
[01:38:30]  I really didn't know how well these book reports were going to go.  I mean, should we get the other intern in to do his?  I guess.  I think we should.  I mean, Jerry wrote it.  We should hear him out.  He's a good guy.  Yeah, I guess.  Does anybody want my thing?  I only wanted a couple of tastes of it.  Quincy shot me.  He was a coroner, but he was also, like, a detective.  Yes.  Yes.  I don't get it.  No.  He was just a coroner who took matters into it.  Because what happened was somebody gave him a members-only jacket, and he realized this  calls for action.  But he never had any normal murder. 
[01:39:00]  Just no.  Oh, he just passed away in his sleep.  Yeah, yeah.  The weird thing, people back then didn't really know what people's jobs were, so they assumed  the coroner went out and investigated the cases, too.  Do you know how inappropriate it would be if Quincy had to testify in court, and they  started asking him a question about his involvement in an investigation?  Right.  They'd be like, you know, so wait, wait, wait.  Wait, let me get this straight.  You went to the crime scene on your own accord, and started, you know, going through people's 
[01:39:30]  belongings, especially five seasons worth of investigation.  And you spoke to the suspect?  Yeah, yeah.  You spoke to the...  And accused him of a murder?  Fucking...  Murder.  Grounds for immediate dismissal.  Yeah.  Everybody that's accused of murder just gets off the hook, because Quincy fucks up the case.  Yeah, exactly.  He's just the case fucker-upper.  Yeah, I want to see, like, after match, I want to see after Quincy... 
[01:40:00]  After Quincy.  ...all of the additional crimes that were committed because of his courtroom blunders.  I felt I needed to investigate.  Yeah, there was a carpet fiber, just like the one in your car.  Dismissed.  Yeah.  Next case, Quincy.  Yes.  We now call to the stand, uh, medical examiner Quincy.  I had to drive...  I had to drive the suspect to the store that day.  We talked about the case.  Dismissed.  Yeah.  This is always something terrible.  He was following me, and he went off a cliff. 
[01:40:30]  Dismissed.  Well, let's get the, uh, third book report.  I didn't know how much you guys were going to enjoy these book reports.  I'm loving them.  Yeah.  I wasn't going to do the third one, but why not?  Sure.  Yeah.  Good thing he's standing right next to me instead of the girls.  How do you snuck in?  Go ahead.  What did, uh...  Go right into it?  This is Jerry.  Well, no, what, uh...  This is Jerry?  What possessed you to do this?  Nice to meet you, Jerry.  Well, you said on the air at one point all the intern's homework was to watch the show.  And, of course, you only brought in the two girls, because...  I meant all the interns. 
[01:41:00]  I specifically...  I understand.  ...said in the office, you had no assignments.  Yeah.  I know.  I'm aware of that, too.  But, like, I'm much more afraid of ONA calling me out than you, Sam.  Oh!  Your face!  So, I wanted to have my bases covered, and then I gave it to Sam, and I was like, listen,  I did this just in case.  All right.  Well, let's see how well this goes for you, then.  It probably...  I don't see...  All right.  Anyway.  Now, you saw the same episode?  The same episode.  Very good.  I actually watched half of another episode before Sidney texted me, told me I was watching  the wrong one, and I went back. 
[01:41:30]  Oh, wow.  That would have been tragic.  I don't like the fact that you and the gals are sexting.  A little bit.  Sexting over Quincy episodes.  Yeah.  All right.  Let's hear his book report.  The O.B. and Anthony Show, from Mr. Sam Roberts, Quincy M.E.  Oh.  Despite a strong performance from its leading man, Quincy M.E. suffers from a cyclical writing  and spotty supporting cast, making the hour drag along.  Wow.  The best and probably most important aspect of the show's occasional success is the passionate  performance of Jack Klugman.  As Quincy, Klugman conveys the character's yearning for justice and quick wit with grace. 
[01:42:00]  In the episode examined, quote, solely be thy name, Quincy aims to clear the name of a priest  who was found dead in the bed with a prostitute.  Quincy's quest for truth exposes what I believe would be a problem with the show upon repeated  viewings.  This coroner never believed that any human just died.  It would appear that every death is a long conspiracy.  Unless this episode was a choice exception in a series that most people find the coroner 
[01:42:30]  who finds the death of the young man.  While Klugman puts a lot in the computer scroll, it's a very fast for the most fucked false  black.  This is only partially the fault of the actors, as their characters are written one-dimensionally  with not much room to breathe or grow.  Aside from the acting, the setting of the 70s shines through the entire show.  The inclusion of what sounds like a live orchestra adds a bit of courtroom to the dramatic senses,  as well as set mood around the insidious conversation.  Additionally, the cars, clothes, and homes of the show have a pleasant 70s charm that I believe 
[01:43:00]  ages well, if at the same time dating the show again.  In conclusion, the episode carried out the plot as one might expect.  One character was set up to be the villain, but evidence revealed late in the episode  eventually proves the guilt for the mother.  The priest's name is Claire.  After watching a full episode, I was up to two questions.  Was this the first show to romanticize a coroner?  And is this show following the classic tropes or writing them?  Hmm. 
[01:43:30]  David Spade is next.  Yeah.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  Sirius XM.  Sirius XM.  This is the Opie and Anthony Show.  Who we are?  Enough!  I wasn't sure.  Thank God they played that.  I kind of feel guilty that I came up with Slabo.  A little bit.  No, you're not.  But it is fun to say, though.  It's a fun word.  It is a fun word. 
[01:44:00]  Yeah.  Where's David Spade?  We'll be here in a couple minutes.  All right.  We got Grown Ups 2, right?  Starting tomorrow.  I never saw Grown Ups.  Oh.  But it made 200...  I was just reading the 270 fucking million dollars for comedy.  And not a dime of it yours.  That's a lot of cash.  No, I mean because you didn't see it.  Right.  I didn't mean you didn't make any money off the movies.  But I'm right on that.  You're right.  Dude, that's over a quarter billion.  I mean, these guys are all high-salary, probably, you know, eight, ten million dollar guys 
[01:44:30]  and Sandler's a twenty million dollar.  Right.  But that's a lot of money, man, for a comedy.  Yeah.  No special effects.  Oh, God, yeah.  Fuck.  The whole thing's filmed on a lake.  Yeah, exactly.  I mean, it's...  Like Gitcha Gumi?  Yep.  Yes.  The Edmund Fitzgerald.  The great comedy of the Edmund Fitzgerald.  The great comedy.  Yes.  I'm trying to get Vic Tabak to play the fucking cook.  Fellas, it's too rough to feed ya.  To feed ya.  Everyone's gonna sing their lines like that.  It's been good to know ya. 
[01:45:00]  Yeah, and I already hired someone to play the guy who chimes the bell twenty-nine times.  Yeah, I'm already having the Icewater Cathedral built.  Oh.  It's gonna be a great movie.  Nice.  We don't have time for this today.  No way.  We've done this for like forty times already.  Yes, we have.  I think it recently played and I'll enjoy it.  You think David Spade is sick of Chris Farley questions?  I would assume yes.  Well, but we've never met him. 
[01:45:30]  Yeah.  So...  Yeah.  But I would assume he's probably sick of those.  We've never met David Spade.  Oh, sick of those questions.  I met him once, very briefly.  I don't know him.  Yeah, we don't know him.  Yeah.  We didn't talk.  I'm just going on.  Joe Dirt is hilarious.  You like Joe Dirt?  Sam likes Joe Dirt.  Yeah.  I'm a big Dickie Roberts child star fan.  You are?  I like the Tommy boy.  Hey, David Spade.  Oh.  Kenny.  Kenny.  Oh, awkward.  No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. 
[01:46:00]  David, it's Bita.  Thank you, Kenny.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Kenny. 
[01:46:30]  Is Kenny in a good mood today?  No.  You can never tell.  I know.  You can never tell.  No.  We're just stalling.  Yeah.  I saw a great show last night, though.  I watched that.  It was called something, a crown.  It was like toddlers and tiaras, only with old ladies.  What? 
[01:47:00]  Yeah.  They were like, you know, 50.  Right.  And 40s and stuff.  And they were in this beauty pageant.  It was horrendous.  One woman, I think she's 55 or something like that.  She was insane.  She's sitting there in a mirror crying, going, my menopause is not me.  My menopause is not me.  What a great idea for a show.  Oh, it is.  It's fantastic.  Oh, David Spade's here.  Yeah, of course we want David Spade.  Oh, my God. 
[01:47:30]  Yes.  David Spade.  What's up, David?  How are you doing, man?  Take a seat right there.  Take a seat.  Pull up the chair.  What's up, brother?  Is that me?  How are you?  That's Sam.  Hi.  How are you?  Hey, how are you?  How are you?  Good, Sam.  Sam Roberts over there.  Big fan of Joe Dirt right there.  Huge fan of Joe Dirt.  Huge fan of Joe Dirt.  Oh, my God.  A little scratchy today.  Yeah, yeah, right?  Yeah, I guess so.  Have you been making the rounds a lot?  I don't know if we should have picked the day after the premiere, but whatever. 
[01:48:00]  Oh, right.  A little.  I saw you guys on the red carpet yesterday.  Nine minutes ago.  I got to walk by.  Yeah, nine minutes ago.  See, I saw all you guys being interviewed.  Oh, you did?  Yeah, that's in my neighborhood.  That movie theater is in my neighborhood.  And Shaq was like two feet above everybody as he was being interviewed.  I know.  I look like Stuart Little.  They always want him to pick me up or something.  It's so ridiculous.  It is humiliating, right?  Being around bigger men when they want them to do little man things with you.  Just hold him like he's a baby.  Yeah, it always goes south for me because I don't, I look like the biggest puss, you 
[01:48:30]  know?  I'd rather not.  And then when chicks try to do it, it's really bad.  Yeah, that's embarrassing.  The girl in the movie, you didn't see, who didn't see Grown Up 1?  Everybody?  I did too.  Jimmy didn't see.  But it's like Inception.  It's so complicated.  We play it backwards.  This is like, you could probably jump in on this one and figure it all out.  Yeah, yeah.  There's a girl in this one that's super tough and she plays my girlfriend, but she's like 
[01:49:00]  a bodybuilder girl.  And I know on the carpet, they were just starting to whisper, like, pick him up.  Oh, no.  I go, no, no, no, no.  They always want those embarrassing shots.  What are they doing?  Yeah, I know.  It's horrible.  Just pick him up.  This will be great.  I heard you guys doing a little Edmund Fitzgerald.  Yeah, yeah.  You know.  I love that song because I went to see Gordon Lightfoot.  Those are the kind of concerts.  You did.  You had to get the chicks.  Oh, who's got this?  Oh, that's so nice. 
[01:49:30]  Chicks from the Gordon Lightfoot show.  He knows how to tell a story.  Yeah.  Man.  The only, like, 12-minute song.  It's really a toe-tapper.  Yeah.  I love it, too.  I think it's...  I told the only time I've ever requested to a radio station was I called into a Light FM  station when I was, like, 14 and requested Wreck of the Edmund Fitzgerald.  You did not know that.  What a little douche.  I was a douche.  Really?  They didn't play it.  Of course they didn't.  They don't really take requests.  I don't know why that song is so popular.  It's not a happy subject.  No.  It's not a real toe-tapper.  I never knew what was really going on until it was a real song. 
[01:50:00]  I go, oh, brutal.  Yeah, yeah, right?  It's been good to know you.  Yeah, it's good to know you.  Yeah, I go, wait, what's happening?  Are they going home for the night?  Yeah.  Leaving the bar?  I saw him in Los Angeles and went to see him with some chick, and she was like, oh, sweet.  Of course, it couldn't be more of an old man show.  Oh, no shit.  And this guy, I'm just telling you, you know his stuff.  And so, but I saw him before, and then he shouted me out at Carefree Highway, because 
[01:50:30]  that's in Arizona where I'm from.  Damn.  So I was like, you like that shit, huh?  That's pretty fucking...  The chick was like, no.  No?  Did she know his stuff?  Well, she goes, this one sort of feels familiar.  I think I know.  She probably saw it in a movie or something.  I know.  Maybe.  It's not the panty dropper concert, I thought.  No.  What's the first concert you remember going to?  Oh, for sure, I remember going to Heart.  Heart?  Really?  Yeah, that's not a bad first one.  Yeah, that's pretty good.  Someone asked my first movie in an interview, and I couldn't remember. 
[01:51:00]  Everyone knew their first movie.  Do you know your first movie?  Yeah, it was probably the only movie.  I did one line in Spider-Man.  No.  Your first movie you saw.  I remember the first movie I shot.  No, the first movie I ever saw, I can...  I want to...  No, it might have been...  Jaws is the first one I remember, I believe, going to, or Star Wars.  It was one of those.  Oh, yeah, you're right.  Maybe one of those.  But Jaws.  Heart was my first concert, I know for sure, but I can't think of the movie.  Heart was hot, and my brother came, and he brought some... 
[01:51:30]  I think slow gin, if that's something.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  Whatever it was, I borrowed from it.  Like slow gin fizzy.  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah, and he was sitting next to me, he got me the tickets, and he goes, they don't want  fucking kids here, and I'm like, I want a dick.  I paid him to get the tickets.  All my brothers hated me growing up.  They're like, they don't want freshmen here.  I go, it's a freshman party.  Were you the youngest?  Yeah.  Yeah, so you were the one that was like...  I was shockingly sort of a pussy, too.  Tag along.  Yeah.  Yeah, you know what?  I got to jump in there, too.  I was the biggest pussy, and my brother was always getting in trouble, and he was hanging 
[01:52:00]  out with his friends, and when they started smoking weed and stuff, and I'm  ratting him out to my parents, I was just a chore to be around as a kid.  Yeah, I was a snitch.  Oh, my God.  I was the biggest rat.  Terrible.  Why the fuck would you do that?  My brother would steal from my mom.  We were totally broke, because my dad scrammed on us when we were like four, six, and eight.  Jeez.  So we're just three little kids.  My mom's got two jobs.  She's just busting her ass.  She'd come home, and he'd steal her money, and then she goes, we don't have the money. 
[01:52:30]  What happened?  He looked at me.  He goes, I'll fucking kill you.  Holy shit.  And my mom's like, do you know anything?  Am I going crazy?  Did someone steal it?  I go, I don't know.  And he's looking at me out of my fucking back.  Oh, my God.  And he's like, Mom, shut up.  I don't know where it is.  I'm like, shut up?  Mom?  Oh, my God.  I didn't really appreciate the fact that she had two jobs with the most selfish asshole  kids.  Did you ever see your dad again?  I bought him a condo.  That's how stupid I am.  Damn.  You know how that goes?  Pretty nice. 
[01:53:00]  Sorry, I took a bite.  That's right.  We don't care.  We do it all the time.  You do it?  Yeah, we don't care.  Don't even worry about it.  They get pissed, but we don't care.  My dad took a powder.  Actually, we were in Arizona.  We were in Michigan.  He moved us to Arizona and then left her.  Wow.  Now we don't even know where we are.  Oh, my God.  Oh, fuck.  Don't know anyone.  So he's out skirt chasing.  And then he'd show up once a year and give me a Nerf football for Christmas.  Thought he's my hero again.  Oh, my God.  Thanks, Dad.  Oh, it's two colors.  Just spoil me.  That was like once a year thing.  And then my brother. 
[01:53:30]  Then I started doing okay in stand-up, you know, in Arizona.  But later, she let me move in with him to save money or whatever.  But more like buddies.  You know, I was probably 19.  God, this sounds insane.  You should have one bedroom with those two twin beds.  This is exactly like my upbringing, by the way.  Yeah.  This is exactly the same thing.  This is why when I wrote Joe Dirt, I'm like, this is all the shit from growing up.  Walking around with a gas can with my shirt off.  And then he started hanging out more if I was doing more shit in town, you know, because he'd say he's my dad and he'd get free drinks. 
[01:54:00]  And then my brother started Kate Spade with his wife.  And then he got to say to the girls, oh, I'm Kate Spade, my daughter.  He sort of fudged it a little bit.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  The son.  But.  And so he would play all, you know, you don't know David Spade?  Oh, what about Kate Spade?  And he'd find some way to get free drinks.  And so he did that forever.  And then I bought him a condom.  Then I bought him a car.  And then he complains there's no pinstripes on it.  It's all crazy. 
[01:54:30]  Oh, wow.  Yeah.  Yeah.  You got to get the sheepskins with the whole package.  You know, your dad looking like an asshole.  I go, yeah, you're right.  Oh, you're right, Dad.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  That power over you.  Yeah.  That sucks.  Then, like Joe did with that movie, the first time we wrote it, it was sort of like a crystal meth guy, you know?  It was sort of that tip.  And then we had to tone it down.  Tone it down, make it a little more.  That's more the real guy, you see, jigging around Arizona.  Like as a kid, I don't know what's wrong.  I go, what's going on with these guys? 
[01:55:00]  Just the white trash, crystal meth-headed flu or something.  The year-round.  I was meeting Chris Rock last night.  Oh, is that pictures from the premiere?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Sorry.  Yeah, the...  Excuse me.  When's the movie open, actually?  Tomorrow.  Tomorrow?  Technically, tonight.  Tonight.  Yeah, did you hear that?  I heard that.  Tonight.  They do that trick where...  At midnight?  No, like seven.  I think at an early time because midnight wouldn't make as much sense for us, I guess.  I don't know, but they didn't say anything.  I go, you've got to tell everybody. 
[01:55:30]  Right.  No, you can start watching it tonight.  Tonight, yes, seven.  Keep it a secret.  That's always good.  The movie opening, you know.  We've got fucking Turbo coming out.  So we've got to...  It's a brutal summer for trying to get a movie out.  Yeah.  For sure, yeah.  Why?  Well, because the biggest ones come out right now, and so we're right in the middle like  we were last time.  Last time we were after Toy Story 3, which was the biggest movie the whole summer.  We couldn't even beat it the second week.  It still made 50-something.  Wow.  I was like, fuck a duck. 
[01:56:00]  And now we've got Despicable Me.  Yeah.  Which is like crazy.  That's a monster.  But, I mean...  Oh, did you see this in South Africa?  Yeah.  You're just driving down the street, and there's a cheetah chasing some antelope or gazelle.  Oh, that's so hot.  And then the thing just jumps right into the SUV.  Oh, it did?  Oh, wow.  Oh, yeah.  It said, fuck that.  Yeah, he's like, thanks, man.  And you see there's a cheetah right on his ass.  Right.  I like the cheetah over here, like, putting the brakes on.  Yeah.  You know, Sandler has...  He was just doing a movie in South Africa.  Really?  And he showed on his iPhone, he had a little video of, you know, they take him to all the 
[01:56:30]  wild country safari things.  Like, when I was a kid, you go to the real thing where they, like, walk around.  That stopped quickly, I think, once everyone got mauled.  But he was...  They had, like, a cheetah or a panther.  There's all, like, different kinds, whatever.  But it was one of the scary ones.  And he was walking around behind him.  And the guys are going, you know, they're always so calm.  They're like, it's fine.  Give him some water.  And ZZ Sandler, lean over with the lady, get some water like this, and the cheetah just 
[01:57:00]  jumps on him from behind.  Oh, shit.  Wow.  And the lady throws him off.  And Sandler's got a big cut on his back.  And I go, what happened?  He goes, you're not supposed to kneel down.  They told me later, you can't kneel in front of him for some reason.  They think you're trying to attack him.  So...  Oh, wow.  And I go, it was terrifying.  I go, what'd you think?  He goes, it's like 250 pounds.  It jumped on my back and it knocked me down.  And then they grabbed him and hit him with a stick or something.  And I go, why the fuck are you out there? 
[01:57:30]  Right.  Like, it always goes sideways.  Every video is like...  Yeah, where do you think those clips come from?  Along with the lion.  And then his buddy, Jack, the producer, has one with his kids.  And they're in a convertible.  And they're 10 feet from another one.  A lion eating like a carcass, you know?  And it's hard to see on the radio, but...  It's hard to see a lot on the radio.  But he's not supposed to make any noise.  And he brought his kids.  And the kid drops something.  And the thing looks up.  Oh, man.  And stares at him. 
[01:58:00]  And then looks down.  And then the other kid stands up and talks.  And it looks again.  And then starts to get up like this.  And they go, ooh.  It's a convertible.  Yeah.  First of all, it could catch up.  And then it could just jump in.  Jump right in.  That's great.  Why wouldn't you roll the...  Well, fucking put the top up.  Who has the balls in a convertible to stop and watch a lion eat?  I know.  That's nuts.  Well, it's just got a convertible anyway, man.  And I love the fact they forgot to tell Adam Sandler not to squat.  Like, that's interpreted, I guess, as a fucking... 
[01:58:30]  You know, because cats kind of squat down and then pouse on you.  You might want to tell them that ahead of time.  Oh, look at this kid.  Oh, that kid's been everywhere.  I was on TV with him yesterday.  Oh, you are?  Yeah.  He had a shoot off at Shaq.  Look at his little suit.  Like, he's going to a business meeting.  Oh, he just got...  They just threw the basketball into his face.  Come on.  Great Santini's kid.  He had the dad in there.  Look at her.  I'm here at the hoop.  Poor little kid.  He had a five-foot nerve hoop, and then Shaq had a regular... 
[01:59:00]  Yeah, he wound up beating Shaq.  Shaq's fun, isn't he?  He played Sandler yesterday, and he beat Sandler.  Yeah.  Yeah.  We had Shaq on once.  He's a lot of fun.  Yeah, he's cool, dude.  He's a cool dude.  He's really cool.  And he wound up being funny in it last night.  I was just watching it.  I don't know if he'd ever seen it before, but...  He plays a police officer, right?  Yeah.  Yeah.  In the new Grown Ups.  Yeah.  We were just looking at the numbers from the first one.  Holy Jesus Christ.  Oh, yeah.  That's goddamn huge.  I don't know what happened.  That's why I don't think you have anything to worry about. 
[01:59:30]  Well, I do think...  Yeah, I do think...  I don't know if we can beat that Despicable Me, but I think we'll do all right.  And then there's Pacific Rim, which looks kind of cool.  You know, that movie.  So, as I was telling you earlier, is that every movie, there's a big one, and then it  trickles into the next couple weeks, so you're still...  Like, the heat did well, and that was funny, and so they just keep going, and then a new  one comes, like, five days later, and so you just gotta tread water also.  So, do you just freak out when movies come out? 
[02:00:00]  It's gross.  Are you just sitting there thinking, oh, God, do something?  Well, I don't...  It's funny, because, you know, press is part of it.  The movie has to be funny, and people have to...  I go by, like, a poster and a trailer, and then I'm either in or out.  I don't care if I sell someone on Ellen.  So, but you have to go out and do it.  You know, you do all these things, and make the best of it, and just hope you sway somebody.  And, but we have about 13 cast members, so...  Yeah, right?  It's literally, like, barraging America.  I know they're like, fucking, we get it. 
[02:00:30]  Yeah, you're right, yeah.  Go to the movie.  I got the message.  They're all over the place.  I mean, there's big fucking posters for this, too.  Oh, yeah.  Like, the side of buildings, and like, everywhere you go, it is absolutely everywhere.  That's a lot of money they're spending ahead of time, huh?  But you're Quinn's buddy, is that right?  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Okay, because I saw Quinn last night, and he ragged on me on Twitter all day.  Really?  Yeah.  Well, he, um...  He's the worst.  We love him.  I love him.  He's great.  On Twitter, it's hilarious.  He was, he was talking about his nonchalant showbiz day yesterday.  Yeah, he's tip, I just saw on the way here, typical night for CQ, and it's all the photographers 
[02:01:00]  and the press line.  I'm not in this for the ego part of it, and everyone's like, what the fuck are you talking  about?  Yeah, they start bashing him.  Everyone bites on it every time.  It's so easy.  He's such a great troll.  Catches on.  I tell Colin, like, I know what you're doing, and it upsets me.  Yeah, yeah.  I know what you're doing, and it's like, he's just the greatest at it.  There's the picture right there.  A typical night for CQ.  For CQ.  And he's always got hashtags, like, uh...  Did he change his avatar, too?  Yeah, he changed it to that photo he's been trying to show everybody. 
[02:01:30]  All right.  Trying to do it.  He came in here, bringing about his...  It's one that didn't make the post.  He sent it in every week.  Larry, is that him?  Oh, yeah.  What's he doing?  Imus?  That's Imus.  Imus.  Looks like Charlie Brown.  Imus in the morning.  He fucking looks good.  Yeah, he looks good.  He cleaned up good.  We don't get to see that version of Colin.  No, he comes in pretty much in his pajamas.  Yeah, dipping his fucking...  His muffin in tea. 
[02:02:00]  We get, like, the just woke up Colin.  I think he's an English gentleman.  Showered and shaved.  He was there last night, too.  Yeah, everyone was there last night.  Is that even live today, or no?  Is that a replay?  I don't think I would ever know what Imus anymore.  No, I think that's live.  Well, there's a bunch of girls in it, too, that are cute.  Yeah.  When I saw it last night, I was like, oh, yeah.  I mean, there's enough guy candy.  I wasn't worried about that part.  Did you actually stay for the film?  I did.  Because a lot of you guys...  I was like, yeah, yeah, yeah.  A lot of you guys, you go, you do the red carpet, you go in the theater, and then you 
[02:02:30]  do the old sneak out the back.  Yeah, I know.  I've always seen it twice, and I have my buddy here.  Yeah.  Oh, I thought he was in here.  My buddy from Arizona that I grew up with, and I brought...  Christopher's brother, Kevin, was here.  And so he came with us, and some other...  One of my other idiot friends.  And so they'd never seen it, so I sat back, and I sort of wanted to see how it played.  Yeah.  And I've seen it with two test audiences that were great, and last night, when it's all  industry, a couple things don't work the way they used to, and you go, oh, boy. 
[02:03:00]  Oh, shit.  Overall, it was funny, and it did great, and we were happy, and I was like, God, there's  so much going on in it, because I hadn't seen little tiny tweaks to it, and Sandler's always  trying to add and tighten and brighten and just make sure it's good enough, and with all  those people in it, there's always something going on.  Yeah.  So it worked out great.  So we were all happy, and now we just fucking hold you, bro.  Barrage the United States with that.  Now I just go, they go, look at you as a little kid. 
[02:03:30]  I'm probably like 10 years older than everyone in that picture.  That was from my prom, where I did not get laid.  You just don't have a picture of you smaller to match up with everybody else?  I have like six pictures of me now.  Yeah.  It's like, you want to see my kid at lunch?  Right.  Yeah, yeah.  And my buddy had a hundred pictures of his kid getting pumpkins, and I go, who the fuck?  What's happening?  Like, where are those going?  Who gives a shit?  How do you give a shit? 
[02:04:00]  You're with your kid.  Yeah, there's like this huge record of where everybody's lives now.  Yeah, I don't know where they all go.  It's clogging up the internet.  Oh my God, that's great.  I have a rose on the bottom.  I see that.  It is your prom picture.  We cropped the shit out of my date, though.  She was like right next to me.  Damn.  And you didn't fuck her?  No.  Oh.  I didn't fuck anybody.  I wasn't on a show.  I was just some asshole trying to look like Brad Pitt back then.  And then the next, I was totally in love with that chick, Paul. 
[02:04:30]  And I took her to the prom.  And she's like, oh yeah, yeah, yeah.  And I was like, oh my God, this is it.  And so I got all dolled up, picked her up.  It was about 110 degrees.  And I'm waiting at her door.  And ding, ding, ding.  And then I hear, whoo, whoo.  And there's some Van Halen.  And I go, I look over, some dirty goddamn Camaro pulls up.  Oh, sure.  College boyfriend drops her off.  And I'm like, wait a second, what?  They start Frenching.  Come on, what the fuck?  I'm sitting there like drenched in sweat going, wait a second. 
[02:05:00]  And she's like, comes in, in a tennis outfit and goes, oh my God, is that tonight?  And I go, uh.  And then she goes, no, no, just give me two seconds.  I'm going to take a shower, find something to wear.  Find something to wear.  Find something.  Where you've been shopping for months.  Meanwhile, you've been thinking about this for forever.  Holy shit.  What a story.  No, no, I'm still going.  You're still going?  Still going.  Um, yeah.  We're supposed to be at fucking Red Lobster a half hour ago.  You know where, you know where she is now?  What?  Do you know where she is?  No, do you know. 
[02:05:30]  I do know I saw her.  You do?  Yeah.  Does she look as good?  Um, not, no, not exactly.  No, she still looks cute, but, um, I think she's still married.  She's one of the few that made it through.  Yeah.  Everyone, you know, you see everyone, they're always divorced.  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  But sometimes in Arizona, they stick it out longer.  Really?  Because, yeah, like I've got the guys that married their high school girls and they're  still together.  So, it's pretty, pretty high together rate, shockingly, because where I'm from, it's 
[02:06:00]  like low.  Yeah, yeah, no shit.  Everyone's like, why don't you just do a two-year marriage and just do that one of those?  I am.  They have a two-year marriage plan, right?  It's like almost like guaranteed.  Yeah, yeah.  No, just married for a year, then have a kid, then right when the kid's born, you guys break  up.  That's what everyone does.  Or hang in there for another six months, like you're really trying for the kid, and then  just call it quits.  It's probably good, because then the kid doesn't even know what it's like to have two parents  to lose, you know, that whole marriage.  I always wonder, like, because I know friends are like, we're waiting until the kid's 18. 
[02:06:30]  I'm like, when is, so the kid gets what's going on, but when is it good, like it doesn't  fuck the kid up?  I know a girl who's 27, her parents are getting divorced, and she's so fucking freaked out  about it.  Fucked up about it?  Yeah, and I'm like, try four.  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah, you know what?  Age isn't good.  Like fucking 11.  Yeah.  Four to 11.  I don't have any recollection of my dad, like, too many.  Being around the house.  I just remember him now going, let's put all our money in a pile and split it. 
[02:07:00]  We don't have any.  See how it goes.  That's the fun of the game.  You don't know what you're going to get.  I had to get a job at, like, 13 and put in for, like, groceries and stuff.  Yeah.  Like, I'm paying.  Well, you know, you've got to put in your...  And then, meanwhile, you know, I come home from school, and he's sitting there drinking  a Tall Boy Bud.  How was your day?  How was yours?  Right.  Mine was Tall Boy Tours.  Of course.  So funny.  Yeah, the big Tall Boy.  Because then we had a stepdad, and it was, like, so odd. 
[02:07:30]  Because one time, because I was, like, nine, and my mom goes, go call him dad.  It was so gross.  I go, oh, no.  I was like, dad.  He's like, what?  I was like, oh, I was like, oh, I wanted to nerf it.  He told you there were toothbrushes.  Oh, shit.  Gave me a shotgun shell reloader. 
[02:08:00]  Nice.  Such a dirtball.  So we'd go shoot tarantulas and shit.  Was he cool, though?  He was cool.  He was all right.  Because there's a lot of horror stories with the step parents.  And he was a doctor.  Oh.  So, and the phone rang.  I never quite got that he was on call for the emergency room.  And he's like, glug, glug, glug, glug.  Get it.  And I'm like, hello?  Oh, there's been an emergency.  He's like, mother fuck.  So then he, I'm like, are you going now?  Like, I get, I go, he seems weird, because I don't know he's drunk. 
[02:08:30]  Oh, my God.  Back to the office.  He probably was completely functional.  I just let my knee open once, playing baseball.  And they took me in.  And he was working.  I'm like, I don't want this guy.  I know what this guy's all about.  He's all hammered.  I go, oh, boy.  Holy shit.  That's insane.  Did you at least make out with the prom date?  I'm obsessed with this night.  No, it was tough.  Oh.  And then the next year, I was in love with another chick for the whole year.  This is why I'm all, like, tough now about it, I guess. 
[02:09:00]  Yeah.  So the next year, I get this girl.  And then, and she, I think, maybe got some boob action.  But that was a mercy boob.  She's like, just grab it and get out of here.  Oh, man.  Man, did you just have no game whatsoever?  Zero.  Yeah.  And then I, the one chick I did hook up with was sort of passed out.  And she didn't start that way.  And it's, I don't think it's bad.  She was sort of okay at the beginning, but dosed off somewhere in the middle. 
[02:09:30]  Yeah.  And then, that didn't slow me down, but.  But then I saw her working at Circle K a couple years later.  I'm like, hey, man, I want it to go again.  Yeah, of course.  It's like 10 years later.  Oh, wow.  I'm like, Circle K, I thought it was the greatest job.  I go, I always go to Circle K.  This is awesome.  Is that your first fuck?  Yeah.  Oh, that's great.  That is a good one.  She was pretty hot, too.  And then all my friends go, oh, I used to fuck her.  I go, what?  Oh, man.  That's something you never wanted to hear either. 
[02:10:00]  I just got, like, some, like, pass around.  I don't care.  Who cares?  It was great.  At that point, yeah.  And then college, bleak again.  Another dry spell, huh?  Shit.  It was all a dry spell.  Until, I don't know.  It slowly started.  But you have no game.  Even though I got on a TV show, I still don't know what to do.  And then they have to really make it easy.  The fucked up thing with back then was, like, you could get laid.  And it was a miracle if you did.  But then it's like, wow, okay, I know what this is like.  And I know I'm not going to get laid again for at least, like, maybe a year. 
[02:10:30]  Yeah.  Maybe an entire year will go by.  And you just don't have those opportunities.  You have no game.  Don't give up, don't it.  Yeah, yeah.  Don't enjoy this.  Too much.  Too much.  Too much, because...  You could be jonesing for a while.  Yeah.  Yeah, you're not getting anything.  There's a good time, though.  Oh, man.  Then, no, there's more dry spells.  It's all just a Bob Seger song.  No, no, it's getting...  It's rough.  The first girl I ever fucked started fucking my Jamaican friend.  Oh, God.  Damn.  Afterwards.  Wow.  And then we still hooked up a couple of times. 
[02:11:00]  I remember the last time we had sex, she had had sex with him earlier in the day.  Jesus, dude.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  I remember that.  And then I'm banging her doggy style and her ass stunk.  Oh, my God.  Jesus, Jimmy.  And her defense, it stinks anyway.  Yeah.  I don't think that had anything to do with the Jamaican guy.  It's just what she was.  Oh, my God.  Yeah.  Jimmy.  Yeah, well, you know, I have heard from girls, you're the first white guy I've gone out.  What?  Oh, really?  Start with me, yeah. 
[02:11:30]  I'm going to do zero damage.  I wouldn't like that back then, but now I wouldn't mind it.  I've gotten so filthy in my older age that I don't mind hearing that now.  Back then, it would have freaked me out, but now I'm going to tell me how much better  were they?  Oh, that's so weird.  Yeah, that's the only thing is, like, you get older, it gets a little nastier.  Nastier.  Well, do you want to hear a girl's history or no?  Like, I don't mind hearing that.  I start to, and then I get, like, one turns me on, then one turns me off right away, and  I, like, I'm going to stop.  You're dumb enough.  Yeah, because it's super dirty. 
[02:12:00]  Is this last night?  No, not all of it.  Sorry, I'm paying attention to one thing.  No, no, not at all.  Grown Ups 2 starts tonight.  Yes.  And everywhere tomorrow as well.  Can you see that on your computer, what he's doing?  Oh, yeah.  Who is that?  Oh, she's beautiful.  Yeah.  That girl's name is Halston.  She was in, uh, she plays Sandler's kid's girlfriend.  Wow.  How old is that?  Sounds horrible.  She's, like, 21.  Oh, okay.  She plays younger.  But there's, like, 10 girls in it that are super cute.  That's a girl you fall in love with in high school and just have zero shot with? 
[02:12:30]  Ugh.  Zero.  Wasn't it heartbreaking?  Awful.  It's terrible.  I told you the girl.  That girl is so much prettier than any girl that ever went to my school.  Yeah?  I would not.  Yeah, there's girls.  My school, the prettiest ones, uh, I was sort of, like, the fun friend, and it was sort  of a buzzkill.  Yeah.  I always thought there was something going on.  I still get this.  Where you're, like, I need a guy like you, you know?  And you're, like, I know, right?  And then I'm, like, listing all their problems their stupid fucking boyfriend doesn't want  to hear from you.  And then, and then they go, I should be with you, I should be with you. 
[02:13:00]  And then they break up, and I hear, like, on a Sunday, they broke up on Friday.  I go, holy shit, really?  So then Monday, they're, like, holding hands with a new guy.  I go, what the fuck?  What happened?  Yeah, you're, like, next in line.  I'm the guy.  You got stepped over like Fredo.  Yeah, exactly.  I was too easy.  That was what I learned.  I was too nice, too easy.  Just never worked.  Damn.  No matter how many times you heard, like, nah, this type of guy, that's the type of guy  that gets the girls.  You're, like, no, I'm going to be the exception to the nice guy rule. 
[02:13:30]  I'll be the nice guy and treat them all great and stuff, but, and they'll, they'll  like me, and then you just, you're fucked.  If they get a whiff that you, like, you can try, because if they, if you don't really  like them, and they can tell, then they're all over you.  It's just such a weird thing.  It is a weird dynamic there.  If you try to fake it that you, that you don't like it when you do.  Yeah, they can smell it on you.  They can tell, and they fucking hate you.  Like that cheetah on the gazelle.  Exactly.  They smell that shit, you're done.  They know, and I go, I'm going to wait, like, a day, and all that shit, and they're  like, no, we, if you try to play it off, yeah, Aaron, wow, wow, we're on pop sugar. 
[02:14:00]  Yeah, Aaron Heather, and she's in grownups too.  Wow, she's, wow, she's beautiful.  She's the, I'm here, we got to wrap up.  She's one of the cheerleaders, okay.  Oh, man.  No, no, on your end, not ours.  We'd love to have you, man.  We'd love to have you for another hour.  Are you kidding me?  Patrick Schwarzenegger, he's hot, and he's in it.  Oh, damn.  Taylor Lautner.  I tried to bunk with him.  I go, I guess we have to bunk up on this.  He goes, no, no, I have my own room.  I don't know if I'm going to bunk up. 
[02:14:30]  You never heard that term before.  You know what's kind of morbid, but I was thinking of it the other day, is I was watching  Dickie Roberts, and how many of those people at the end singing that song are dead?  Jesus Christ.  You're like, I'm watching, and I'm just going, oh, this is kind of cute.  One of the Corys, Haim.  Corey Haim.  We filmed that song, and I was walking to lunch, and he goes, hey, man, I get per diem,  right?  I go, oh, I don't know, yeah, sure.  And he goes, it's like 200. 
[02:15:00]  And I go, maybe.  And he goes, can I grab that from you?  Like, he wanted you to shell out the money.  I didn't know what to do.  I go, can I talk with him?  He goes, so, can I get it from you, or should I?  And I go, I don't know if I'm the guy, but.  I'm the guy, you know, starring in this.  Yeah, and then he goes, but I only got like an hour from, I'm like, hey, cool, just so  you go.  Wow.  And then he's scrammed off, I think, to get whatever.  Yeah, apparently.  I'll take lunch.  Yeah.  Apparently so.  My lunch is off campus. 
[02:15:30]  I go, oh, okay.  Oh, yeah.  Leaves the Paramount lot and then comes back.  Jesus.  Oh, that was, who was that one from?  Yeah, this is the Dickie Roberts song we're playing.  Yeah, yeah, at the end.  And it's a bunch of child stars, and they're singing, you know, a parody song, kind of  a goof on being a child star.  But then I'm looking at the people, I'm like, okay, they're like Ron Polillo.  Yeah, he's gone.  Oh, he's gone.  Ron Polillo is there?  Yes.  Rerun's gone.  Rerun.  Oh, fucking Fred Burr.  That's right.  You ever see Vice Squad with him?  No. 
[02:16:00]  Oh, where he fucking plays a sugar pimp who gets stabbed in the dick?  No.  Sugar pimp.  Yeah, Wings Houser stabbed him.  Wings Houser.  Yeah.  You need to be more careful about his parts.  Yeah.  All right.  Choosing roles.  All right, guys.  Yeah, we got to get to you.  Yeah, Dan has got to go.  Hey, it was a pleasure to finally...  Thanks for having me, though.  Pleasure to finally meet you and have you in here, man.  Tonight at 7 p.m. or tomorrow?  Starts tonight.  Tonight.  Nice to meet you.  Grown-ups, too.  Yeah.  Nice to see you.  And we'll be back.  Stay there.  Bye, dudes.  Bye.  Bye.  The OP and Anthony Show.  The OP and Anthony Show.  On Sirius XM. 
[02:16:30]  The OP and Anthony Show continues.  The OP and Anthony Show continues.  The OP and Anthony Show continues.  The OP and Anthony Show continues.  We got Charlie Day outside the studio. 
[02:17:00]  By the way, David Spade was really cool.  First time we've had him on the show.  Absolutely, man.  Hope he comes back.  That was really good.  Really, really good.  Funny hangout kind of guy.  Charlie Day.  Ah, Charlie.  How are you?  Take a seat right there.  We're actually on the air.  We just...  Pleasure to meet you.  We just do a come right in, sit down on the air kind of thing. 
[02:17:30]  That's great.  Yeah.  That way people know it's real.  I don't like that whole, you know, they come in, sit down during a commercial break,  and then you're like...  Just stare at each other.  Yeah.  You like say things that you...  You're like, oh, we should have set that on the air.  They tell the best stories before they come back.  Like, what'd you do?  Oh, man, I'm tired.  Just shit on a hooker.  Oh, and then you're back on the air.  Fuck that.  Yeah, it would freeze up.  This way you can come in frozen.  Yeah, yeah, yeah. 
[02:18:00]  So Idris Elba's in this movie?  Yeah.  Fuck, man.  I'm obsessed with meeting him.  I've not met him yet.  Why?  I love The Wire so much.  Oh, sorry.  Yeah.  That's cool.  Yeah.  That's the only reason.  Yeah.  I was really depressed when I found out he was English, just because I was like...  It's so odd, right?  Was that strange?  Yeah, my guy is such a better actor than I am.  Yeah.  You know, I can't go the other way.  I'm not going to go to England and butcher their...  Yeah.  It is humiliating when British actors come.  Like, I didn't know Gary Oldman was British until I heard him interviewed. 
[02:18:30]  Yeah, well, he's just...  Yeah, he's crazy good.  Or Idris.  Who else?  There's so many.  Mick Nolpe on The Wire.  Yeah, all those guys.  You find out they're all British.  Yeah.  Everyone in Batman.  Fucking...  Who?  Bale and...  Christian Bale.  Bale, there's another one.  Yeah.  Fuck.  Just like...  He does an amazing American accent.  Yeah.  Are we that easy?  Yeah, I guess so.  I guess so.  If you're a great actor, maybe.  Yeah.  You know, it's easy.  I think they just have a more intense acting discipline over there. 
[02:19:00]  It's, you know, like learn every accent.  Right.  And, you know, where we're just like, hey, you good at fart jokes?  Great.  Yeah, yeah.  Welcome to Hollywood.  Everyone in America does like their Beatles version of an English accent.  Oh, man.  Oh.  It's bad.  Yeah, yeah.  It's just terrible.  Wow.  Pacific Rim.  Have you seen it?  No.  No.  Not yet.  You're going to love it.  I'm waiting.  It looks insane.  I know it's my job to come in here and say you're going to love it, and I kind of wish  I wasn't in the movie, and I'd seen it so I could tell people and they'd actually believe  me.  But, uh... 
[02:19:30]  I like, I love the movie.  Yeah.  What do you like about it?  Unless you, like, if you hate fun, then you might not like the movie.  If you're like, you know, like, I only like movies like Sophie's Choice.  Oh, boy.  Yeah.  Yeah, yeah.  It looks huge, like, like a huge movie.  That's the thing about this movie.  It's gigantic.  Yeah.  I would recommend seeing it in IMAX, which is where I saw it for the first time, and  then, like, my mind exploded.  What's it about?  Basically, it's about giant monsters coming out of the ocean and the robots that we've 
[02:20:00]  built to punch them right in the face.  You know, it's like a classic, almost Godzilla-esque, they're called kaiju, the monsters are kaijus,  like, from a...  Oh, so it is like Sophie's Choice.  Okay.  Very much Sophie's Choice, you know, like, do I keep the baby, which child do I keep, and  which one do I punch in the face?  Because I think it's a lizard from space.  But, uh, like, it's just like a fun summer blockbuster.  The movie's awesome.  I see you're happy with it.  It's got...  When you watch something, do you, like, critique yourself, like, ah, fuck, I hate this, or 
[02:20:30]  are you kind of comfortable and enjoy watching yourself work?  You know what?  I've been very lucky to have done so few things that I haven't done one yet that I've been,  like, you know, like, Horrible Bosses was great, so watching that, I was like, oh, this  is fun, this is good, I love sunny, it's always sunny in Philadelphia, and, uh, but earlier  on, when I started out, you know, it was a lot of, like, oh, I hate this crap.  And, uh, I'm reading that your first...  Wait, wait, can we ask him for one?  Yeah.  One that I hated?  Yeah, one example of, we'd love hearing those. 
[02:21:00]  Oh, man, let me, uh...  Maybe it's a commercial, or...  Oh, yeah, I did tons of shitty commercials, uh, there's, like, one on, going around the  internet right now that I talked about on a talk show, which is Thomas' Bagel commercials,  really bad.  Um, but, like, what else...  I love digging those up, man.  Oh, man, yeah.  You're like, hey, look at this guy, he looks like an idiot.  It's like, they always get, like, if you're a young actor and you need to eat, they always  got that on you.  Yeah.  It's like, you gotta do a couple, a couple bad gigs. 
[02:21:30]  Um, man, what did I do?  Like, I was, like, the mailroom kid, and, like, the Mary Tyler Moore special, like, just,  like, a lot of, uh, schlocky little one-liners.  That's what I was gonna ask you about.  Did you work, did you, did you have scenes with, uh, her or Valerie Harper?  Yeah.  You know, there's this funny audition where, uh, like, she looks at herself in the mirror,  and I have one line, and it was, like, looking fine, and I sort of said it sarcastically in  my audition, like, hey, you don't have to keep checking yourself out, like, you look  okay, and then I get down to set, and they're like, all right, this is Mary Tyler Moore.  You can't be sarcastic. 
[02:22:00]  You really have to compliment her that she looks very good.  Oh, God.  So, like, looking fine turned into, like, looking fine.  A very different thing than what I'd expected.  Oh, no.  You know, you want the fun Mary Richards, but you get the one from fucking, uh,  From ordinary people.  Ordinary people.  Yeah, the ice queen.  Brown socks to the son's funeral.  A little bit.  She's very sweet to me, though.  It was very nice.  Yeah.  It was like, for her first gig, and, uh, you know, made me feel like I belonged there.  How was Valerie Harper?  She's still alive, right? 
[02:22:30]  She didn't meet her, didn't see her, didn't return any of my phone calls.  Damn it.  None of my fan letters.  Uh, of course, I wasn't really a fan.  I gotta be honest.  It's like, that's all before my time.  Yeah, yeah, exactly.  I was kind of there being like, I don't give a shit about these people.  It's a job.  Yeah, this is a gig.  They probably sensed it, too.  Like, every young actor's probably so in awe of them, and then you just didn't give a fuck about them.  Yeah, I think there's like a, like a, like a mid-70s, 80s cutoff for, uh, for their major fan letters.  Yeah.  You know.  What did you grow up like, enjoying and watching on TV? 
[02:23:00]  Let's see.  I mean, I'm, you know, I was, uh, I'm born in 76, but, uh, probably didn't really pay attention to things until 85.  So, you know, like, you know, E.T. and, uh, and, uh.  Back to the Future.  Yeah, Back to the Future, Star Wars, that's, that's my whole thing.  Yeah, what about, like, TV shows, because they were pretty cheesy.  You know what I loved was Night Court.  Yeah, yeah.  Did you guys watch Night Court?  Oh, yeah, oh, yeah.  This is my favorite.  I don't know, because it took place at night.  It was like, I felt like, you know, like, after when I was supposed to go to sleep, and I'm like, oh, this is what adults are doing at night. 
[02:23:30]  This is very interesting.  Going to court.  They're all going to court.  You know, and sitting on whoopee fishing.  The judge is always a card, isn't he?  Yeah, he's doing magic tricks up there.  Never seen that.  Markie Post is just getting fucking beatings and everything she does.  In her Lifetime movies.  Yeah, that's all she does is play, like, the abused woman nowadays.  I know.  She came in and auditioned for us for a part in It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia.  Yeah.  And, you know, it's one of those things where you're like, oh, my God, that's, that's Markie Post. 
[02:24:00]  You know, we want to cast her because, you know, we all love Night Court, but, like, she was, like, very wrong for the role.  Oh, right, yeah.  It's really tough, like, to see those sort of actors come through.  Was she bad?  Well, I can't say she's bad if she's wrong.  She wasn't bad.  It was just, like, yeah, that this woman was supposed to be really, I guess we didn't picture  her as beat up as apparently she's getting.  Right.  She looked very good.  She looked very good.  We found looking fine.  We got to.  We found looking fine.  Yeah, we got to. 
[02:24:30]  Get out of here.  Is this treasure on the radio?  It's quick.  Sure.  It's Mary Tyler Moore in the office.  There's Charlie Day.  Excuse me.  I'm looking for Jonas Seemeyer.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Just hit right up those stairs up there.  Oh, I forgot I had another line.  Yeah, look at that.  Another line.  Two lines.  Looking fine.  Oh.  That was great. 
[02:25:00]  Looking fine.  I'm, like, checking her out.  Yeah, you know, what the?  That is awkward.  You gave her a wink, too, Charlie.  I gave her a wink.  And now she's all happy.  She's got a little pep in her step.  I don't know.  Thanks to you.  That seemed a little weird, maternalistic thing.  I know.  Weird.  Like mother's son.  It's a little weird.  Yeah, you were a little too young to be.  But maybe I'm going to bang her.  Right, right.  I don't know what's going on in that show.  Make Mary eat your ass in the mailroom. 
[02:25:30]  Oh, no, I would have done it.  I needed money.  I was like, look, it's in the script.  It's on NBC.  It's a big part.  That's a great first role, though, man.  Like, you're going to see Mary Tyler Moore.  Even if it's just that, it's fucking great.  It was a good gig, yeah.  Pretty impressive.  Big time.  With Sonny in Philadelphia, were you surprised with how much freedom you get for content? 
[02:26:00]  No, not really.  Because that was sort of the deal about doing it at FX, which was like, here's a place where  they'll pay you nothing, but they'll let you do whatever you want.  Yeah, okay.  You know?  Right.  And just to get the chance to...  It's a great show.  Oh, thanks, man.  Oh, my God.  It's one of the best.  Yeah, we're doing season nine right now.  I know.  Jesus.  Jesus.  Yeah.  Amazing.  How has it worked with DeVito?  He's great.  Yeah, obviously.  He's great.  I mean...  And I can't...  I can barely keep up with the guy.  He's a maniac. 
[02:26:30]  Yeah.  He likes his fun, and he can party, and he never sleeps, but he's a really good dude.  Yeah.  Yeah, it's...  It really is...  There's quite a difference watching a show where you get some real language, you know, real  situation.  It takes you out of it when you know they'd have said something a little more harsh, and  they pull back on network TV like that.  I don't know how those shows can compete in this day and age.  Exactly.  Where you can find anything you want sort of tailor-made to you, and you're right. 
[02:27:00]  It's like, how do you pull your punches?  It takes you right out of it when it's like, nah, you wouldn't have backed off like that,  or said something rude.  I like the believable dialogue in a sitcom, though, like, off the funny look, and then  the crowd explodes with laughter.  I mean, that's it.  It gets me every time.  That's what it gets you.  Oh, every time it gets me.  Sure.  Hey, look, you're in the majority, I think.  Yeah.  So don't feel bad.  Don't feel bad.  Oh, it's hilarious.  Yeah.  All I would do if I was working with Danny DeVito is do fucking Cuckoo's Nest lines. 
[02:27:30]  That's all I would do is talk about...  Which is odd, because most people would think taxi, yeah.  I love taxi, too.  It's a fucking masterpiece, but Cuckoo's Nest.  Man, here's...  What lines would you do?  Just, uh, I bet a nickel.  I bet a dime.  That's all I'd say.  I bet he'd love that.  Oh, he would never get old.  Constantly.  His lines.  Oh, yeah.  It should be...  Only his.  Yeah, good.  There's someone that's worked forever.  Yeah.  I know.  Like, he's never...  Every year, you could look at his body of work.  Yeah.  Over the...  And the guy that I'm sure everyone was like, you want to be an actor? 
[02:28:00]  Right.  Yeah, exactly.  All right.  You're two feet tall and a little pudgy.  A little abrasive.  A little lacking.  Lacking the hair.  He was great in Ruthless People.  You ever see Ruthless People?  I dare you to kill her.  When he struck his wife.  Like, Bette Midler, I think it was.  Yeah.  Was kidnapped.  War of the Roses, too.  Yeah.  He directed War of the Roses, too.  That's the thing.  Amazing.  What a smart guy.  Really?  Yeah, yeah.  Look at us blowing smoke up his ass right here.  Yeah.  Well, it's nice.  This is encouraging.  He's not like a typical leading man.  Do you want to crap all over him? 
[02:28:30]  Or...  Yeah, yeah.  Let's just shit on someone.  We need to...  All right.  Let's make ourselves feel better.  Let's get to it.  He really phoned it in.  I've been a much better penguin.  Were you acting in front of a green screen a lot?  No.  That was the awesome thing about this movie.  How would they pull that?  They actually built giant robots.  Well, no, they didn't build giant robots, but they're so giant that you're actually not  in the scenes with them.  Right, yeah.  But any scene that I was in, Guillermo is this crazy director, and he's a brilliant guy. 
[02:29:00]  He did Pan's Labyrinth and won copious awards.  So he built these gigantic sets.  Things were always on fire.  There were chickens and dogs running through the streets.  Things were caving in.  It was always raining.  Things would explode.  There were practical props and little creatures that were supposed to be crawling on the big  creatures that he built, like tiny little actual creatures.  All right.  So you're not staring at a tennis ball hanging from a wire? 
[02:29:30]  No, never.  Wow.  It was pretty great.  And then you see the movie, and then all the CGI, which they really did a great job  with it when you see it, combined with those giant sets, and it's the most massive thing.  Is the CGI as good as Sharknado?  Sharknado on SyFy?  Tonight?  No.  No, but it's close.  Sharknado.  Explain this to me.  It's a SyFy original.  You know how they've been pumping out these movies where they get people from like the 
[02:30:00]  80s or 90s, a few stars, and throw them in these movies?  Here's the plot.  Storms in the Pacific have whipped up water spouts and sucked up a bunch of sharks.  A lot of sharks.  If they go over land, they fling thousands of sharks out at people, and they proceed  to bite people.  Very similar plots.  Yes.  Exactly.  All right.  All right.  I think a little bit more money went into this one, I'm going to guess.  So ridiculous.  Tara Reid's in it. 
[02:30:30]  Tara Reid.  Mary Tala Moore, Valerie Harper.  Tara Reid.  Good.  Tara Reid.  She's still working.  And the father from Home Alone.  Home Alone.  Now, who is that?  Exactly.  I just know him as the father from Home Alone.  The father from Home Alone.  We don't know his name.  You want to see the trailer real fast?  Oh, it's fantastic.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Can we turn you on to something today, please?  This is great.  Hurricane David is poised to be the first hurricane.  It's a storm.  That's what's driven them all up north.  I've never seen so many.  There it is.  I'm a lone guy.  Look at this. 
[02:31:00]  It's fairly even raining.  It's flooding.  Not the plumbing.  The ocean.  You need to go home.  I'm not going anywhere.  I'm from 90210.  Shark right through the window.  You can't sit back and watch this.  Sharknado.  Hornado is heading towards the airport.  We need to destroy it before it gets to them.  Shark's a fall on people.  Yeah.  Watch out.  Look out.  The shark's climbing the rope.  Shark to rain down on him.  Ben!  I'm not kidding. 
[02:31:30]  Yeah.  We're getting pro-bombs into the toilet.  This is ridiculous.  This is actually based on a true story.  Too many of them.  We're getting a big chopper.  Guys, I think I'm in here for loading the wrong book.  Yeah.  I think this is what American is.  Exactly, right?  You got to see the Ferris wheel.  The Ferris wheel is just crushing people.  Look at that special effects there, Charlie Day.  Can you compete with that?  Right.  Can you compete with that shit?  Yes.  But the amazing thing is there was no CGI there. 
[02:32:00]  They actually killed 1,500 sharks.  That's amazing.  That's tough to do in this day and age.  Yeah.  You're called the damn liberals.  You know what's funny?  That dad from Home Alone, I used to wait tables here in New York when I was starting out.  You know, before I was getting those sweet Mary Tyler Moore gigs.  Yeah.  And I used to wait on that guy.  Really?  Yeah, totally.  At the Cornelia Street Cafe, like, down in Greenwich Village.  And he was okay.  He was not a dick.  Oh, okay, okay.  But who's on top and who's on bottom now? 
[02:32:30]  My God, I was just thinking that.  It's like, right, who's in Pacific Rim and who's in Sharknado?  Yeah.  You know, what's going to happen is that I'm going to be in Sharknado 5 one day.  You know what I mean?  And some kid's going to be in here.  Some young upstart.  Yeah.  One of these interns in the hallway.  Check this out.  Remember when that guy was in Pacific Rim?  Look at him.  Sharknado 5.  Sharknado 5, man.  The heretic.  Everyone's talking about Sharknado.  It's on tonight.  So we watch that tonight, then we go and check out Pacific Rim. 
[02:33:00]  Are you guys out now or do you come out tomorrow?  We come out tonight.  Oh, you do tonight.  Yeah.  What time?  I think like 7.  Everyone's doing that.  They're doing that.  Everyone's doing that.  Yeah, they say, fuck the Fridays.  Let's start this whole thing on Thursday.  People can't wait.  Why wait?  Right.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I think once people are excited, let them in.  Let them see it.  I like to see it in IMAX if it's playing in IMAX.  Definitely.  You have to see it in IMAX.  There are movies that you just have to see in IMAX and that's one of them.  It's so big.  You just want that immersion feeling like you're in it. 
[02:33:30]  Yeah, watching it made me feel like when I saw, say, Jurassic Park for the first time.  Oh, man, yeah.  And I wish, I don't think IMAXs were even around.  You know, can you imagine?  But that, I think I went back like two nights in a row to see Jurassic Park.  Yeah.  Like three times in a row.  I was just blown away.  I saw the 3D version recently.  Oh, really?  They re-released it in 3D because there was somebody who I was kind of hoping to put my  penis in and that's what she wanted to see.  And I agreed it sounds like a great idea. 
[02:34:00]  And it just isn't made for 3D.  It's okay.  It was better done than it probably, I thought it would be.  It's not the sexiest movie in the world.  Not at all.  To bring a girl to.  No.  Yeah.  You know, you got the Jeff Goldblum thing.  People getting eaten by velociraptors.  Yeah, yeah, getting eaten.  Although the thing sneezes on them.  I'm like, huh?  You know.  Jimmy, you want a little of that?  But did it work?  No.  Oh.  No.  Oh, boy.  No.  What happened?  Did you blow it?  No.  She wasn't meant to be.  That's a shame.  She wasn't attracted to me. 
[02:34:30]  That's sad.  Why would she be?  Oh, Jimmy.  But anyway, I saw that and it was kind of, I wouldn't recommend.  That was sad, man.  Wasn't it just sad?  Don't say, why would she be?  That's fine.  Oh, we hear that every day.  Yes.  That's like nothing.  He's good.  Look at him.  They don't want to go to coffee with him or something.  He just wants to take him to lunch and they won't even do that.  Yeah, just a nice girl to lunch.  That's it.  That's all you want.  That's all I want.  A little lunch.  A little lunch.  Take her to Pacific Rim.  That will get you laid.  Yeah, see?  That will get you laid.  It probably would because a girl enjoys a big movie like that and I would fucking name drop. 
[02:35:00]  It's like, you'll do something.  I go, it's funny when he told me when he did that.  Would you talk to him?  Yeah.  You can say that we're best friends.  Yeah.  That'll do nothing for you.  I'm a terrible name dropper anyway.  I'm really mad at it.  Yeah.  Girls never care if I drop a name.  They just don't give a fuck.  Like, can you introduce me to them?  No.  Well, nothing.  Who's any hot, what they call chicks in this movie? 
[02:35:30]  Yeah.  Yeah.  Are you into Asian women?  Sure.  Why not?  Uh, you know.  Iapacia Lee.  There's an actress named Rinko who's a lead actress.  Yeah, yeah.  Look at that.  Wow.  Wow.  Look at that.  And she gets some butt and she's beautiful.  Sexy?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I remember seeing some, like, kind of training to get inside the thing and she looked pretty  good doing that.  Those poor sons of bitches in those suits, like, got beat to hell making this movie.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Because they're actually, like I said, the guy built these giant props so he built the 
[02:36:00]  inside of the helmet of the robot that they pilot and he was, like, constantly shaking  them around like they were on, like, an elliptical machine for 16 hours a day.  If they're getting punched in the face, it's got to react like you're getting knocked for  a loop.  Yeah.  So they beat the hell out of them for months and months.  Me, I was, like, having bagels, eating coffees.  These guys, like, had to worry about their abdominal muscles.  Who'd you play?  I play a scientist in this movie and he's, like, sort of a cocky, nerdy guy. 
[02:36:30]  He's Dr. Newton Geisler and I'm, like, obsessed with the monsters and I have sort of theories  about how to stop them and no one will listen to me.  And so I eventually say, fuck everybody.  I can swear.  Oh, sure.  I say, like, fuck everybody.  I'm taking to the streets to sort of solve this problem on my own.  And in this particular movie, you know, a guy with the brains can actually be a bit  of a hero, too.  A bit of a quirky guy.  Doesn't always have to be the most handsome man in the room.  Or the strongest. 
[02:37:00]  Or the strongest.  Or the guy in the suit.  You know, sure.  Skinny tie.  Good skin.  None of that.  Got the skinny tie working for you.  I got a skinny tie.  Yeah, he wants to be a rock star.  Of course, he's sort of a geek.  But he gets his little rock star moment in the movie, which is good.  And who does Idris Elba play?  Idris Elba plays Stacker Pentecost, which is a great name.  And he's like, he used to be one of the pilots of these robots.  And back when we used to be winning the war, and now we're losing the war. 
[02:37:30]  And he's sort of like the last man standing.  He's sort of like the general of the army.  The army is gone.  We're more of a resistance.  It's like a ragtag group of people coming together to try to save the day.  And does he play a British guy or an American?  He plays a Brit.  Okay.  He does his accent.  No, I don't mind that.  No, I saw Luther.  I actually liked him speaking in a British accent.  It just took a little bit of getting used to it. 
[02:38:00]  He plays Stringer Bell.  He plays Stringer Bell.  There's actually a name in the movie.  He lived through the shooting, it turns out.  Now he's doing this.  He's like, man, I'm going to stop these robots.  And then I'm going to fucking clean up Baltimore.  I can't wait to see it.  It looks really good.  It's going to do well.  A lot of action.  I like it.  It's fun, man.  I guarantee if you enjoy a fun movie, you'll enjoy a movie.  Because you know what?  It's not so overly serious, which is kind of refreshing in these big sort of action movies, 
[02:38:30]  which Atlantic Rim.  I see you giggling over here.  What's going on, Sam?  Because the makers of Sharknado made a movie called Atlantic Rim.  Are you kidding?  They jumped right on it.  They just took the entire...  How fast did they do that?  I don't know.  Is it out yet?  I don't know, but nobody should see it, because they'll be filled up with Pacific Rim.  Well, it's like you get your fill with Pacific Rim, and then you get Atlantic Rim, right? 
[02:39:00]  Boy, they really are.  They are terrible people over there.  That's horrible.  At least they have integrity.  I bet the CD-i is really good.  Well, whichever one of them gets a sequel, that's the one I'll be calling.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  I feel like you're feeling Atlantic Rim is going to get the sequel.  It was shot in Toronto.  Oh, okay.  Starting with the father from Home Alone.  That would be great.  Both of you are in the same movie.  Did you see the land room, too?  You'd be like, I used to wait on your table.  That son of a bitch. 
[02:39:30]  Son of a bitch.  It is amazing how you remember everybody who was nice to you and everybody who was shitty to you.  Oh, yeah.  You never forget, man.  Yeah.  The ones who treated you fucking horrible.  No, I'm always nice to someone in a restaurant.  And, you know, they're handling your food.  Yeah.  They can spit on it.  Yeah, how stupid could you be?  Right?  Yeah.  Yeah, you want to think it wouldn't happen, but it happens.  You best, yeah, it happens.  Anybody stiff you?  Oh, yeah.  Any celebrity stiff you?  No, it's usually just like little old ladies that would stiff me.  Yeah. 
[02:40:00]  Maybe they don't have the money.  Did you ever follow somebody out and go, was there a problem with the service?  Yes.  Because that's a really cool thing a server will do.  They'll go, let's just basically go, what's happened, motherfucker?  Where's my money?  Yeah.  And what was their response?  The service was terrible.  Yeah, they could always pull that out of the head.  Yeah.  Looking back, they probably had a good point, but it seemed very unjustified at the time.  They actually told you the service was bad.  All right, that's fair.  You know what it was?  I remember the time they had asked, because it was like construction on the street, and 
[02:40:30]  they were sitting out on the street.  So they'd asked to be sat in this little table way in this private room on the inside.  It was completely the other side of the restaurant.  So I was running around all day and serving people, and I would have to go into this little  back room and check on them.  And I guess they felt as though they weren't checked on enough.  But not only did I move them to a separate area, and then they didn't tip me.  And then I told them not to come back to the restaurant.  But I also knew that I was quitting really soon, so I could say something like that. 
[02:41:00]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  I think the worst thing a waiter can do is not come back and check when you're just sitting  there for longer.  That's true.  You're doing the head crane thing.  That's the worst thing.  Because the food, I mean, any dummy can know they're not cooking the stuff.  They're bringing it to you.  So as long as they're prompt with it.  But man, when you're waiting there, and you're like, my fucking drink has been sitting here  empty.  And you're looking around.  You're trying to like, anybody that walks by a waiter, you just want to, so maybe they'll  tell them. 
[02:41:30]  Yeah, let me just say, I was the absolute worst waiter.  Were you terrible?  Just a total airhead.  You know, like, oh, you had the chicken?  No, you had the fish, right.  Let me run back to the kitchen.  You didn't try to be one of those guys that never wrote anything down, were you?  No.  I hate those guys.  No.  I hate them.  I would slowly write everything down.  I'm not impressed.  Don't get it wrong.  Write it down.  Stop trying to be off book.  Just fucking put my thing.  You're not impressing anyone.  Table of eight.  And they're just like, what'll you have?  And they nod.  And they're just nodding. 
[02:42:00]  I'm like, he's got to fuck this up.  I think hit a microphone.  Yeah.  Oh, wow.  I think hit a microphone.  You think?  It's just a show.  Because they give you that nod, like, yeah, I got a super memory.  Do you?  Then why are you waiting tables?  Well, sometimes I think the restaurant wants them to do that, right?  Like, it's like...  Yeah, yeah.  They don't want to.  Yeah.  Which I'm fine with, like, please, by all means, write it down.  Yeah, because I'm just...  Now I'm all stressed out.  Like, did he hear what I said?  Because I like it.  If you say it and you see him write, you know, okay, he got that one.  They get it wrong when they write it down.  So you're like, oh, fuck.  They're going to get it wrong. 
[02:42:30]  Bastards.  Or whatever.  What does this have to do with Pacific Rim?  No, they're just chatting.  No, this is just interesting things for people to, like, sink their teeth into.  Yeah, this is, you know, the TMZ stuff.  Did you start filming Always Sunny Season 9?  Yeah, we filmed the whole season, and we're editing it together right now.  What kind of topics are you guys hitting on this year?  We've got a bunch of good ones.  A personal favorite of mine is we're all sitting around in the bar in one episode,  and we're realizing that all these other bars have won all these awards  and that we've been around a really long time and not won any awards, 
[02:43:00]  which is sort of a wink-wink to the show.  Yeah, right.  And we sort of, you know, we go to other bars to figure out what they do.  Some are, like, really bright and loud with the, you know, loud colors  and ring a bell, tell people when to drink, i.e. laugh.  You know, others are, like, dark and moody, and there's a lot of, like, sex,  but it's, like, period costume sex, so it's not, like...  Right on, man.  And then we, you know, we try to adopt their techniques to our bar for, like, this showcase, 
[02:43:30]  and, of course, you know, we screw it all up, and we realize that we're probably to blame.  And then, let's see, we got one that was written by the guys who write Game of Thrones,  which is a weird sort of thing where they were just huge fans of the show,  and they wanted to write an episode for us, and we're like, well, keep the dragons out of it.  How odd is that? 
[02:44:00]  You should have kept the dragons in.  What the hell?  I know.  Well, we don't have a big budget over there at FX, so...  Wait, why haven't you guys won any awards?  That sounds crazy.  What do you think it is?  I mean, I don't know.  It's a good question.  I think we've always just sort of been a little under that radar.  You know, it's also, I don't know, it's a very sort of young kind of college-y show,  and that's not necessarily usually what wins awards.  It's well-written. 
[02:44:30]  I think so.  It's well-written.  Look, I think it's crazy.  Hilarious.  But what are you going to do, man?  How do you manage to stay, like, underground-ish for nine years?  For nine years.  I know.  By that point, you know, there should be lunchboxes and all kinds of other stuff, you know, out there.  No, no, we're not usually in those, like, comedy issues of, like, GQ or Variety.  But in a way, I think the audience likes that.  I think they don't feel like it's...  You sold out, man!  Yeah, like, for better or worse, we've retained our street cred. 
[02:45:00]  Right, right.  I don't know if it's a good thing or a bad thing.  Are you on Twitter?  I'm not on Twitter.  Yeah?  I was on it for a little bit.  I'm like, I can't.  Like, it's taking over my life.  It's like, people are able to write me directly.  Right?  We talk about that all the time.  It's insane.  In the old days, you couldn't just...  You didn't have immediate access to Burt Lancaster.  I know.  You had to go through, like, 50 people, and he probably wouldn't even see it.  I know what you can't take it. 
[02:45:30]  You can't take it.  What's surprising was how much sort of anti-Semitic stuff I got, like, you damn Jews, stupid Jews  taking over Hollywood, and, like, I'm...  I was joking.  I'm Irish Catholic.  And I'm Irish Catholic.  I'm not even, like...  You damn Jews.  You know, like, I'm Italian-Irish Catholic.  I'm, like, but, uh...  God damn.  I was like, you know, you're as bigoted as you are misinformed.  It is funny how dumb people are.  Aren't they fucking morons?  Yeah, there's a lot of angry people out there.  Aside from Twitter, then, are there any internet outlets you go to that people bash you or stuff, 
[02:46:00]  and how do you deal with it?  You know, it's...  I don't...  I just sort of ignore anything like that.  Yeah.  What's actually more weird and what I sort of had to get away from was how much, like, people love you.  Like, the...  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Because that's weird, too.  It's weird, too, right.  You know, like, that can get to your head, and then you're like, well, I'm the greatest person alive.  Yeah, I've got one of those.  Because people are tweeting it to me.  You know, or, like, a lot of, like, I...  Like, will you marry me and have my baby? 
[02:46:30]  And then you're like, well, no.  I'm married and I have another baby.  So, like, you know, I...  Yeah, but...  But you can't jerk me off in the car.  But you have a really cute picture, and I don't want to be thinking about it, so...  What is this story?  Oh, no, I'm just saying, like, that's an option.  If you don't want to marry the girl because you're already married, you can just let her jerk you off.  I don't know if that is an option.  I don't think that's...  There's a whole other outlook on all that stuff.  I don't think that's in the bylaw.  This might be why you're single.  This is not a lady problem.  I am truly not a catch. 
[02:47:00]  Charlie really has to go.  Yes.  They gave us a land.  How did you get me out of here?  We're just getting...  No, it's your side, man.  It's your damn people, man.  It's not us.  They're ruthless.  You're busy.  You're a busy guy.  I gotta go try to sell this movie all over time.  I want people to see Pacific Rim tonight at 7 p.m.  or just tomorrow whenever you want to see it.  And it is an IMAX, which is exactly how I'm going to see it here in New York.  Yeah.  And we're fans of you, and we've been trying to get you on for a long time, so...  Nobody told me this.  I'm glad it finally happened.  I figured.  Well, I'm happy to be here, guys.  So please come back and see us, all right?  Yeah. 
[02:47:30]  All right.  Very cool.  Be right back with James Cromwell.  Ooh.  The OPN Anthony Show.  Fun, fun, fun, fun, fun, serious XM.  The OPN Anthony Show.  Continues.  We're back. 
[02:48:00]  Oh, I can see you.  Oh, yes.  James Cromwell in studio.  James Cromwell.  We are actually on.  Hello, sir.  We're having a crazy day.  How are you?  A very busy day.  Great.  You look great.  Look at you.  Thanks.  Old.  No.  Not at all.  You're aging well, sir. 
[02:48:30]  Fabulous.  You're fine.  You aged quite well, sir.  Thanks.  You look fine, sir.  You're doing pretty good.  Well, you play in the movie.  I saw the movie.  It's still mine.  And you play a guy who's, what, like 87 years old?  Yeah.  Which is weird to start playing roles where you have to, like, tack that age onto it?  Like, oof.  No, the man I played built his own house.  Not only did he build the house, he felled the logs, milled them himself.  No help.  Poured the foundation, framed it, roofed it, plumbed it. 
[02:49:00]  I was in the house.  So, if that's an 87-year-old man, I don't have to play.  I don't have to put it.  No makeup.  I couldn't do it physically.  So, I thought, well, it's fine.  It doesn't matter how I look.  Wait, he did all that at 87?  At 87.  Wow.  He was 90 when he finished it.  Wow.  And when did he die?  He died, actually, directly after we did the film, but he lived in the house for a couple  of years with his wife, which is why he built the house.  Sure, sure.  She had the beginnings of Alzheimer's, and, you know, the choice was either she goes into 
[02:49:30]  an institution against her will, very unhappily, and their entire life is just blown to pieces,  or he builds this house to give her as easy a transition into whatever that dark night  of dementia is, but at least she got to be in a place that she loved, and with somebody  who took care of her.  So, it was very, very dear.  And he ran afoul of the building commission in the province, because he did not have architectural 
[02:50:00]  plans, he didn't get his lumber stamped, he didn't have the permits to do it.  It was enraging, by the way, watching this in Canada, watching him deal with this bureaucracy.  It's a real story.  Yeah, yeah, sure.  It happened in New Brunswick.  We didn't shoot it in New Brunswick, except for the last part of the film.  And they would have bulldozed the house, except it got in the local paper.  Then the provincial paper picked it up.  Then it got to the national paper, and the premier of Canada saw it, and he said, you're  going to bulldoze a house built by a 90-year-old man for his wife, who has dementia, out of 
[02:50:30]  your bloody minds.  Oh, and you put it like that.  Yeah, yeah.  Oh, golly gee.  Stupid.  You're right.  But it shows you how inhuman organizations are.  Like, watching you deal with the...  He goes in to get a permit, and you realize, this is a guy in his 80s who's just lived life  on this land, and I have to start dealing with this shit bureaucracy, and it made my  stomach tight watching it. 
[02:51:00]  Yeah, you know, the regulations, one of the reasons I like the film, it doesn't...  It's not black and white.  The guy is not that wrong.  They put those regulations in place because there are unscrupulous builders who cut corners  and build substandard houses, which they sell to unsuspecting people.  That's why you have regulations.  But the problem with authority, as we now know in this country, is that once authority has  some power, they want more power.  And then, they don't look at individual cases, and they don't care whether you're capable,  they don't care whether it's a unique circumstance, they just want to impose the rule because 
[02:51:30]  they can't see anything past the rule.  Right.  And you wind up with Mr. Snowden, who I very much support.  Oh, you like him?  I do, very much support him.  I'm up in the air on him.  I kind of...  I like WikiLeaks, I really like what they do, and a part of me is like, well, did they  put people in danger at all, or...  Like, I'm kind of in the middle, but I don't hate Snowden, I kind of...  There's people that want him executed for treason.  Sure.  And then there are people that think he did a great thing.  Is he still in that airport?  Yeah, still in the airport.  Oh, he's got to be getting sick of the food. 
[02:52:00]  Well, look at Julian Assange in the embassy in London.  He's been cooped up there for a year.  A year.  No, the thing that somebody said, one wonderful person said, the government is no longer afraid  of Snowden, or Julian Assange, or Bradley Manning.  The damage has already been done.  And as to putting people in danger, everything that they released is vetted by The Guardian,  or The New York Times, or the papers there, and no lawyer in a newspaper is going to say, 
[02:52:30]  you can't print.  Right.  So they take out all the things that wouldn't actually endanger national security, and they're  telling the American people the truth, which is what the Obama administration is afraid  of.  Not those guys, but that somebody else in the government might say, oh, Snowden was right.  This sucks.  This is illegal.  This is unconstitutional.  This is unjust.  And I'm going to expose it.  That's the people that they want to frighten.  And misinform the American public, so that we don't know what's happening, until we wind 
[02:53:00]  up one day, and we have turnkey totalitarianism, and the deal is done.  Yeah, yeah.  And it can happen just like that.  They don't want a breach in the dam at this point.  Exactly.  So, you know, they look at these guys like, well, it will give people ideas, and if enough  people do it, it undermines their power, yeah.  We're not talking about the film now, but...  No, no, no, but it's okay.  Do you think, because Obama, I mean, again, he's another guy I'm up in the aisle.  Like, I kind of like him personally.  He's more liberal than I am, but I kind of like him, but a lot of people who support him 
[02:53:30]  are very disappointed, because they feel like he wasn't transparent like he said he  would be, and that he wasn't who he presented himself as.  Actually, every promise that he's made, he broke.  So, I don't know why people wouldn't be disappointed.  I mean, just have to look at Guantanamo.  You know, I know he's facing a Congress that is not supporting him, but in terms of nobody,  none of these banks, none of those people went to jail for what they did, and we went  in the hole, and the person who got us in the war, for no reason at all, in fact, a lie, 
[02:54:00]  he lied to the American, the President of the United States, the other one, Shrub, lied  to the American people in front of Congress, and today he's on the New York Times, flanked  by two guys getting their citizenship in uniform.  So, why is George Bush on the front page of the New York Times?  He has a very good publicist.  If I had that publicist, I would be on the phone.  Not only that, but people, very short memories in this country, very short memories. 
[02:54:30]  Something could happen, and then everyone's all outraged about it, and then after a little  while it goes by, it's like, hey, look, I'm back.  Could I, you know, we see it in New York State alone with Wiener and Spitzer.  It's like, and not that I think any of it is this outrageous bad things that they did,  but it's just the fact that it's like, well, Spitzer more so than Wiener.  Spitzer, he broke the law.  He was going after people that were doing the same thing he was doing, going into, you  know, and getting prostitutes for money. 
[02:55:00]  But Anthony Wiener is just some guy that decided, hey, here's my Facebook and Twitter  and whatnot.  Just say it.  Here's my dick.  What do you call those photographs that people take now of themselves?  Selfies.  Selfies.  A selfie.  He did the wrong selfie.  Believe me, I understand those.  Every photo of me has my feet in it. 
[02:55:30]  But yeah, Spitzer was kind of being self, like he was a total hypocrite, like he was targeting  people for what he was doing, but Wiener's just sending out pictures.  Who cares?  I know.  He's going to come back, though, because he was quite a worthwhile congressman, right?  He'll come back.  They both will come back.  I don't think Spitzer.  You don't think so?  People aren't as sympathetic to him.  I saw somebody on the street when I came out of the subway collecting signatures, you  know?  Oh, really?  Yeah.  Because I guess he has to come up with enough signatures to make it on the ballot, right? 
[02:56:00]  Yeah.  I think he will, anyway.  You know, it doesn't matter.  Back to the movie.  Yes, absolutely.  How did this gentleman get the knowledge to do all the plumbing and milling and cement  work?  Oh, just living long enough to learn it?  I don't realize that in New York, although there are New Yorkers who do this, but in  the rest of the country, people, especially in the middle of the country, you know, they  live on a farm.  You don't call a plumber.  Right, right.  From Topeka to come out to your little town, you learn how to fix the plumbing, you know 
[02:56:30]  what to do with, you know, you wire the barn up, you roof your own house, you know how  to frame it, you get a neighbor who, you know, has shingles.  So, people are very self-reliant.  He's an ordinary man who does extraordinary things because he's principled, he's determined,  and there's really no style.  Yeah, what was his background?  I like that, Ray.  I want to raise my hand. 
[02:57:00]  Yes, sir?  I didn't want to interrupt.  What was his background?  He's a, you know, I think, I thought about this the other day, you know, I know he's  not a farmer.  Right.  I think basically he was a landowner, he owned 2,000 acres, and he probably, in Canada,  milled logs and sold, because he had his own mill, which he was very capable of running.  So, I imagine he was, what do they call it, lumber person, you know, lumber yard.  And without being, you know, not to that extent or anything, but are you yourself handy with 
[02:57:30]  things like that around the house?  A friend of mine came to the screening last night, who was actually a contractor, and  I asked him, and I said, how did I handle the tools?  He said, no, the tools were okay, but you didn't frame the windows.  That house would not have stood.  Actually, the builder who built the house, he was incredible.  One guy built that entire house, you know, totally completed, but, you know, while we 
[02:58:00]  were shooting the film, it went from nothing to a house.  Yeah, sure, sure.  I thought, I know, my hat's off.  My father and I built a shed when we finished.  My father was very punctilious, but because of me, the whole thing, every angle, there  wasn't a 90 degree angle in the entire thing.  Was it a big box?  A big square?  No, but it wasn't square.  No, not square, a little off.  I'm so dumb.  Somebody had stepped on it.  A little off.  Yeah.  Oh, that's great.  He said 90 degree angle, and I'm thinking triangle.  I truly am a high school dropout. 
[02:58:30]  That's great.  God, am I a fool?  That's why you're in radio.  A triangle can have a 90 degree angle in it.  No, I know, but I'm...  Yes, you can.  Yes.  Oh, good.  None of us know what we're talking about.  Surprised you put a roof on the house.  It's amazing.  I can't even look at your IMDb.  There's too many amazing things.  I know.  There's just too many impressive things in the resume.  But the Rockford Files in 74.  Why is this 1955 Daddy Longlegs?  What did you do in that?  No, no. 
[02:59:00]  You know, IMDb, like WikiLeaks, once somebody, it gets on there.  You ask them over and over again, please take that out.  There's evidently some guy in 55 named James Cromwell.  Oh, really?  Before I was a member of the union, and they seem to have forgotten when I...  I'm glad when I came in, so I'm not Robert Cromwell or something.  And he did it, and I can't get it off.  So you also weren't in an episode of Manimal?  No, I was not.  Remember Manimal and Super Train? 
[02:59:30]  Sometimes it's hard for me to remember what it is, but I would have remembered.  You'd have remembered that one, I think.  Wouldn't it be funny if we had the wrong James Cromwell?  Were you all in the family?  No.  No.  I loved your Angels in America.  It wasn't me.  Oh, shit.  Some people think that I'm in Patriot games.  Really?  Yeah, I think it's Jimmy Rebhorn or Donald...  Pleasance?  No.  What's his name?  Sutherland?  No.  I've forgotten his name, and I did a play with him.  Duck?  But Donald Trump... 
[03:00:00]  You know, it must be really...  I always think about Jimmy Rebhorn that, unfortunately, people are like, oh, weren't you in, babe?  Oh, no.  I'm sorry.  No.  I'm sorry.  Well, you were in the late confidant...  No, I'm sorry.  Well, you guys have a physical resemblance?  Yeah, yeah.  You know, I don't think so, but he was in the game, if you remember the game.  He was really...  He's a wonderful actor, and it's really...  It must be like a knife in his back every time.  Oh, somebody else.  How many episodes of All in the Family were you actually in?  Luckily, only three. 
[03:00:30]  Only three.  Yeah.  Why do you say luckily only three?  Uh, I was hired because Carol O'Connor quit the show, because he wanted his name above  the title, and Norman Lear said, what do I say to Jean Staple, and she's as much a part  of the show, you know, and that would be unfair to her.  So, I was hired, my character was hired, to actually kill off Archie.  Wow.  And when we were rehearsing the show where he was going to die, when Carol settled, if I 
[03:01:00]  had stayed on that show, which was their plan, I would have always been known to all of  you as Stretch Cunningham, sort of like Henry Winkler.  That's true.  And even Carol, who was a magnificent actor, because of Archie, when he tried to go back  on the stage, everybody just saw Archie Bunker.  They couldn't see the man anymore.  Yes.  Yes.  So, I really owe my career to Carol for saying he's better off where he is, which is what  he said to me.  You're better off where you are.  Wow.  Were you conscious of that then? 
[03:01:30]  No.  So, you would have just taken the gig.  Oh, I wanted the gig, man.  Right.  I wanted the gig.  It was a great gig.  Oh, man.  I mean, I had gone on to do other things, but that one, you know, I thought, wow, I really  got that guy.  And, you know, it was very popular.  And, you know, cabbies, you'd walk in New York, and they'd roll down their windows,  hey, Stretch, how you doing?  Yeah, I guess it's pretty cool.  That's really cool.  Yeah.  But it has a downside.  You know, success, the wrong kind, has a downside.  Yeah.  And you pay for it dearly.  Wow.  You know, and most people would have thought you were in more episodes than that, because 
[03:02:00]  the name was mentioned so many times.  Yes, the name was mentioned.  Well, there was one other one.  The name was mentioned a lot.  And then Carol, in order to make sure that I did not come back, buried, killed me, buried  me.  I turned out to be Jewish.  And he spoke at the funeral service.  That's right.  And I think he leaned out and said, not coming back.  That's it for you.  That's right.  He didn't know you were Jewish.  That's right.  The character was Jewish.  That's right.  That was a funny episode.  I didn't remember that.  Did he not like you?  No, no.  I was very fond of him and he of me. 
[03:02:30]  It's just that he knew what the cost was.  Wow.  He knew more than I did.  He was much, he was savvier, smarter.  It's almost depressing to watch All in the Family now.  Or such great, great, like, socially addressing comedy that addressed social issues in real  language and in real ways.  Yeah, yeah.  And now it's just such a...  They barely touch it.  They barely touch it.  And when they do, it's emasculated and sanitized.  Like, they don't show you anything honest anymore.  Now, that's interesting.  Now, but Cable, I did a show, American Horror Story.  What do you think about that?  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. 
[03:03:00]  I have not seen it.  Cable's different on the network.  That...  Cable's very much different.  Yes.  They do it on the network, but Cable is picking up, and they're doing...  You don't even know how...  Jimmy should have added, it is finally getting better.  Oh, yeah, and on Cable is definitely...  But there was a long stretch there where it was ridiculous.  Yeah, they didn't learn from what was so successful and great.  They just started to water down.  No, the next echelon of Harvard graduate executives that come in who know nothing about television,  they have to make the same mistakes all over again.  All over again, yeah, yeah.  They bring the same crap back. 
[03:03:30]  Yep.  And it's not run by creative people anymore.  When you see where the viewers are going, and they're going to places like FX and...  HBO.  A&E and HBO, things like that, you wonder why the networks are still adhering to this weird morality.  It's almost like a moral thing.  Like, we don't want to go past a certain point with language or certain content because they  don't want to offend people.  But it's not just offending people. 
[03:04:00]  And offending people isn't that wrong in context, you know?  If you're really putting a message out there or doing something very well, what's the problem  if some people get offended?  There's a problem because your sponsor has a corporate position that should they offend  a segment of the society and that segment decide to boycott your product, your sponsor  is really pissed off.  That's what we saw Rod Serling did an interview and touched on that subject for a good 10 minutes. 
[03:04:30]  It was brilliant, and you could play it right now, and it's absolutely relevant.  What did he say in general?  It was that the sponsors are running the show, and he came up with some storylines that he  had to change because, you know, you can't sell that soap if people are angry at what you're  putting out there.  But cable has sponsors, too, though.  Like, you know, I think the people who subscribe are the sponsors.  And now people want the best television. 
[03:05:00]  They want to be informed.  They want to be pushed.  They want the envelope expanded.  Yeah, yeah.  It's corporate people that want it because they've bought.  They want a particular audience.  They want women from 20 to 25 with a certain amount of income who live in a certain place  to buy this particular product.  So the last thing they want to say is, you know, is somebody coming on, you know, to have  something that is, well, of course, it wouldn't be chauvinist.  But on the other hand, it wouldn't be about women's liberation either. 
[03:05:30]  Right, right.  Or it wouldn't be about abortion or it wouldn't be about the glass ceiling or so.  Anything that might chase away that demo is, yeah, not going to be on there.  And it just, it really cuts down.  It's so good that there are outlets now for the artistic end of it instead of just the  financial end of it.  It's very good for us because it makes some wonderful programming.  It's great to be on.  I mean, I've done, I really like what happened with American Horror Story. 
[03:06:00]  Yeah, yeah.  Six Feet Under was a very, very special show.  And to have been part of that, I'm very proud of it.  Would you go back to any series-driven television?  Well, I'm actually doing a show for ABC.  It's funny we were talking about.  Oh, Jesus.  Oh, no, no.  Don't tell him.  Ladies and gentlemen, James, come on.  Thank you.  Burn the tape.  I'm surprised you didn't run away when we brought that.  Is it a comedy or a drama?  It's a drama.  Okay, all right.  I'll at least have some. 
[03:06:30]  It's a series, it's called Betrayal, and it's been on Dutch television for the past three  years, so it's their most successful show.  And the producer said, you know, it's a Lear story, and since I'm very interested in Lear,  doing a production of Lear, so I get to take even a contemporary version of it I wanted  to do, and now I get all the attendant problems of being on a network.  Right.  I don't have a script for the show where we start shooting on the 17th, because I know  the writer had to submit it to ABC, and it's going around from one executive's office to 
[03:07:00]  another executive's office.  standards and practices, standards and practices, you know, and all the things, and of course  it's rushed because they don't want to put the money into extending the shooting days to  make a better product.  They want to as quickly as possible, so you have fewer takes.  There's a lot of strain on everybody, but it gets done, and hopefully it'll be, you know,  we'll do our best.  Do you leave sometimes, like, going like, damn it, do you get, I mean, it seems like it's 
[03:07:30]  an easy, not an easy gig, but it's like, it's not roofing or something like that, but do you  leave just upset?  I've never done roofing professionally, and I'm sure it's hard, but I want to tell you, to  be on a television series, this is no walk in the parks.  It's mostly for people who have the leads, the amount, the length of the hours, the intensity  of, you know, it's not as easy as it looks to stand in front of a camera and actually  do something.  There's a lot of concentration, physical effort that goes into it. 
[03:08:00]  You do that for 12 hours, 14 hours, and you do it the next day for 14 hours.  It's sort of like writing the Tour de France.  Yeah, I obviously didn't mean to make it sound like it was easy.  I meant like getting, getting angry at the things that you had brought up with the script  and, and that, well, that happens, you know, that even happens on, it happens the same thing  on features, uh, you know, no matter how much time you have, and then it gets, if you throw  money, you know, you're making a $250 million film, they have time.  It takes forever to do half a page. 
[03:08:30]  It takes three days.  And there are hundreds, I did, uh, Longest Yard and the guy, the caterer said to me,  guess how many people we have for lunch?  425 people for lunch.  Whole, I mean, this is not, we're not talking about $125 million film.  That's 400 people.  So 400 people putting their creative and try to make this thing.  That's, there's bound to be frustration.  There's about, you know, somebody's out.  Uh, it's not the, listen, I, my personal opinion is actors show up all the time. 
[03:09:00]  You don't see a bad performer.  You don't go to a movie and the guy, holy man, what the hell was he doing?  We always show up and we always show up on time, but there are so many pressures to get  this thing right.  It's like a battleship.  It is amazing to watch, uh, because I, the length of time it takes to do one, one take  of something just to get one scene.  It's, I've always been stunned at how long it takes.  It's hours and hours and hours for one quick. 
[03:09:30]  That's it.  Well, when we recently filmed with Chris Rock, we filmed for 40 minutes, James, and we  know we're going to be on screen for maybe, maybe two seconds.  40 minutes we sat here.  If we're lucky, we'll be on screen for two seconds.  We had no scripts either.  It was just like a real interview.  It was a lot of fun, actually.  Chris is great.  But we're sitting here going 40 minutes and you know, none of it is going to be used.  It's part of a montage.  We know we're part of a montage. 
[03:10:00]  It was exciting though.  When you tell people you're in a movie and I've heard actors say that and they get cut  and then the company doesn't tell them that they're cut and you show up.  And you go to the opening.  Oh, and you're not in it.  I've had that happen.  Have you really?  Oh yeah.  He edited a film called Pennies from Heaven.  And I thought they can't cut the scene.  I'm there.  I forced the bad guy to jump out the window and commit suicide.  I can't cut that scene.  No.  They cut that scene.  They cut the scene.  They figured out a workaround.  Wait, did I just tell your story? 
[03:10:30]  Yes.  Maybe you're the guy I heard it from.  Listen, any actor who sits in this scene has that story.  Well, I've never had it happen because I don't get it through the audition.  So I never get the punch.  They actually have to be in it first for them to cut it.  Yeah, that's the beauty of me.  Never a heartbreak.  You're tremendous.  I saw Angels in America for the first time recently.  And I've just watched people and they're just talking.  And there's scenes where Pacino is telling you, like, you know, tell me that Roy Cohen's a homosexual.  And there's that whole thing with you.  And I'm like, it's so fucking natural looking, these two guys just talking, having a conversation. 
[03:11:00]  That is so hard to do.  It's so hard to do.  That's a story, if you've got time for the story.  I misinterpreted that scene really badly.  I thought he was a big Park Avenue doctor and he was going to let Mr. Cohen know that in no uncertain terms what was wrong with him and what he had to do.  Which is completely wrong.  So when we rehearsed the scene, Mike Nichols said to me, listen, we're going to shoot Al's way first because he's got all this business. 
[03:11:30]  He had to get dressed, fully dressed, from his underwear, three-piece suit, tie, overcoat, hat, gloves, cigar, cut the cigar, light the cigar.  Al, so he shot for a whole day Al's way.  Al never made a mistake.  And he could go back after a long take and say, I want to go back to this part right here.  I missed this thing.  Wow.  And never missed the piece of business which was called matching.  Then the second day we came my way and I had eaten the wrong thing for lunch and my mouth was so dry I could not talk. 
[03:12:00]  And I got so nervous I couldn't actually write.  I was supposed to write on the thing, but my hand shook her back.  And when we stood off stage waiting to come on for the beginning of the take, Al would reach over and pat me on the shoulder to say, it's okay, Jamie.  You're going to make it through the scene.  And I thought at any moment, Mike Nichols is going to come around and say, I'm really sorry, Jamie.  It's still going to work out.  And he never said anything.  And at the end, I walked past him and he went, great, Jamie.  Thank you very much. 
[03:12:30]  I thought, I'm going to be on the floor.  He'll never come around to my side.  But about six months later, Mike calls me up and says, there's going to be a screening at CAA.  And I want to tell you, we're using your scene to promote the film.  When I see the scene, what happened was all my nervousness and all my discomfort read as a doctor, intimidated by the most powerful man in the United States, scared shitless of what was going to happen to him.  Roy Coyne saying, you say I have AIDS and I will ruin your life. 
[03:13:00]  I will ruin your family.  I will ruin.  And that's really what happened.  So no, no talent, nothing.  Just a fluke.  I did the scene correctly.  You were trying to play it tough.  Because there's a moment there where Roy is saying to you, say I'm a homosexual.  And then you're like, whatever the hell you want to call it.  There's a moment where you kind of get some balls.  It feels like, was that just you relaxing in a second?  Before he snips them.  Wow.  Now I've got to see it again. 
[03:13:30]  Oh, yeah.  See it again.  I'll see it and be like, hmm.  It's one of the most brilliant.  I think that's just an absolutely magnificent piece of work from Kushner's script because he's the best writer in America as far as I'm concerned.  And Mike's work was never better.  And Al and Meryl, what Meryl does.  Oh, right.  It's two roles, right?  Three.  Oh, three.  She plays a rabbi.  And I looked at the rabbi.  I didn't see her at all.  I said, where did they get an old rabbi who can handle dialogue like this? 
[03:14:00]  That's amazing.  And it turned out to be Meryl.  It was just incredible.  They're telling us you have to go.  Yes.  Especially.  We have to promote the film.  Oh, yes.  The film.  Please.  Thank you.  It's really great.  And I loved it.  It was brilliantly acted.  And it made me very angry at parts of it because just watching this guy have to deal with these  these chis-bag bureaucrats was enraging to watch.  I know.  And it's a love story.  It's a love story about two elderly people who love each other. 
[03:14:30]  Yeah, but it was great.  Make love.  And she was great.  Yeah.  Jean-Vierre Bourgeois is magnificent.  And you had good cheeks.  James does a nude scene where he walks in on the floor.  Jesus, Jim.  I was pretty impressed.  Oh, don't give away the best.  I fucking know.  I freeze-framed it.  I was like, not bad.  It's in theaters tomorrow.  And it's called Still Mine.  And I really, really loved it.  It was brilliantly acted.  And just great, man.  Yeah, James is a great actor. 
[03:15:00]  Just amazing.  A lot of fun on the radio show.  Thanks so much for coming in.  My pleasure.  Great meeting you.  And are we done?  I think we're done.  Yeah, I guess we are.  Yeah, what the hell?  Let's get out of here.  Thanks, guys.  All right.  Yeah, sure.  Absolutely.  Watch out now.  The Opie and Anthony show continues, sort of, after O&A Live with Sam Roberts is next.  This is After Opie and Anthony Live.  Here's your host, Sam Roberts. 
[03:15:30]  Oh, my God.  What a star-studded show.  Now it's after Opie and Anthony Live.  And listen to this.  I'm Sam Roberts.  You know that by now.  We had David Spade in here.  Charlie Day from Always Sunny, of course, was in here.  James Cromwell after him.  And now we move straight to possibly the biggest celebrity of them all.  I hope he brought his A-game.  Ladies and gentlemen, on the phone, Joe DeRosa. 
[03:16:00]  What's up, buddy?  Hi.  Hi, Sam.  How are you?  Did you bring your A-game?  Did you realize the celebrities that you're following?  I did not.  Yeah.  I don't like it.  No.  I'm getting comfortable.  Well, how do you think it makes me feel?  How do you think it makes me feel?  They're like, oh, yeah, O&A's got all these people.  What's going on in the after show?  Well, Joe, the guy that usually comes into studio with O&A, is calling Sam.  I, uh, listen, I would be there in person if I was in New York right now. 
[03:16:30]  I would be there.  I'd be sitting with my sweet face, Sam.  Yeah.  We're staring at you across that console.  Like a couple of nice guys that we are.  Just dreaming about each other and the things that can happen.  Yeah, like in a friendship kind of way.  Or whatever.  Or whatever.  I'm a huge Charlie Day fan.  Was he was there today?  Yeah, he was great.  He was promoting Pacific Rim, the action movie that he's doing.  I know, I know. 
[03:17:00]  It's always something in Philadelphia is one of the few things, like few TV shows or whatever  entertainment things left out there where if I met anybody from the show, I would still  be like starstruck by it.  Yeah, well, that's it.  And it's funny, too, because none of those guys on that show, obviously, except for DeVito,  have gone on to be giant stars outside of the show at all.  No, they seem like normal dudes.  Like, they seem like you would get, like, complete...  I think they would be like they are on the show. 
[03:17:30]  Yeah.  You'd go up to Charlie Day like, I don't understand why you're not shouting right now.  I don't know.  What's...  Why aren't you yelling?  Yeah, it's funny.  Like, seeing Charlie in interviews off of the show, it's like when you...  It's like when The Rock does...  Appears as Dwayne Johnson on something.  You're like, what are you doing?  Let's stop it.  Start screaming at people.  He's being like a nice guy, and he's laughing at Diane Sawyer's joke or something, and you're  like, what?  You should throw a t-shirt over her head and put her finger in her nose or something.  Yeah, exactly. 
[03:18:00]  Exactly.  Talk about how she wants your dick, but do it with, like, pastries.  We get each other, Sam.  We do.  That's what I always liked about you.  We get each other.  Ben, buddy.  I've been good.  You know, I've been doing the show, talking to people.  I've been here and there.  I've been uploading stuff on YouTube and podcasting.  I've been all over the place, doing my thing, you know?  Oh, well, that's great, Sam.  How about you, Joe?  What do you have going on?  Well, Sam, I'm down here in Philly at the old Helium Comedy Club.  You know, I think Mick Foley was there not too long ago. 
[03:18:30]  He was, I believe.  I think so.  He was, I believe.  And I'm trying to just do a little press, Sam.  A little press to promote the gig.  And you figured the number one stop that you have to make on your press tour is after  Opie and Anthony Live with Sam Roberts.  I love calling into the show, and I love doing the show.  In fact, I told Roland if he's going to have me come into the O&A soon, I was like, dude,  tell Sam I want to hang around for his show, too. 
[03:19:00]  It's been too long since I've done it.  Well, we'll see what the schedule's like that day.  I can't make any promises, but hopefully we can, we'll be able to squeeze you in.  So you're at the Helium, you're at Helium in Philly all weekend?  Yeah, I'm here all weekend, and there wasn't a ton of radio to do down here in Philly, so.  That must suck for comedians, because a radio where you can go on the air and actually talk  for more than, you know, 45 seconds is just becoming extinct outside of SiriusXM. 
[03:19:30]  Yeah, there's only, like, three shows down here.  There's, like, there's, like, I did an AM talk, like, radio thing today, which is popular  in Philly called 1210 AM, and then there's that, there's Preston and Steve on WMMR, and  then there's John DiBella on, like, something, some other one of the W's.  Will Preston and Steve have you on?  Uh, they apparently would not.  But you've done, you've, so you've done Preston and Steve before. 
[03:20:00]  I have done it before, and, uh, for some reason, Sam.  Yeah.  Yeah, they won't, they won't.  For some reason, they would not have me back on.  Now, why would a radio show not let Joe DeRosa on?  I don't understand, especially if they've had a good time with you before.  Um, I hope it's not a slight on you.  Sam, I don't understand why a show in Philadelphia that seemed to like me quite a bit, and who 
[03:20:30]  I seemed to have a good rapport with, would stop having me on, coincidentally, after the  last time I was on, and sang the praises of one Opie and one Anthony.  Oh.  I don't know if those things are connected.  If I can give any advice to any comedian that comes on the show, and I know I'm not one  to give advice, I would say any radio show you do, just in case, never mention liking 
[03:21:00]  Opie and Anthony, because this show has nothing but enemies out there.  Nothing but enemies.  I will tell you something, I will always mention loving Opie and Anthony, and I say this with  no intention to kiss ass or blow smoke or anything, dude, people come out to see me because of  that show, and because of all of you guys over there.  And it's like, so, you know, I always talk about, like, the difference it's made in my 
[03:21:30]  life, and I always say, in a very complimentary fashion to radio shows that I find fun to  go on outside of New York, I'll say, like, hey, man, like, it's hard to find terrestrial  radio shows that function like this.  This is really fun.  I do Opie and Anthony a lot in New York, and that's really done a lot for me in my career,  and, you know, it's fun when you can find a terrestrial show like this, where you can  actually just talk and hang out and have fun like that, because that's what we do when  I go on there and whatever, and I don't know, Sam, perhaps there is some sort of a... 
[03:22:00]  Yeah, a little rivalry going on.  Don't be afraid, when you're going show to show, and you're talking about, you know,  I love doing Opie and Anthony, don't be afraid to mention Sam Roberts either.  Don't, you know, throw it in there.  I mention you every time.  You do.  You know what?  The really great shows across the country will respond very positively to that, like,  you know, Dudley and Bob in Austin, Texas.  They're great guys, and they're always like, man, tell those guys we said hey, and tell 
[03:22:30]  them how much we love them, and I, in fact, was on their show one day, and all they wanted  to talk about was how, like, ONA had gotten in trouble that week for something.  I can't remember what it was.  But what you do is, you go like, yeah, I spent a lot of time in New York.  I love talking to Sam Roberts and also Opie and Anthony, something like that.  I actually, what I say is, I'll say S-O-N-A.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, that's kind of the new thing, yeah, yeah.  I'm the only one that says it as far as I know. 
[03:23:00]  Yeah, that's, I mean, it's really, really new.  Let me ask you, Joe, have you been developing a thicker internet skin lately?  A thicker what?  Internet skin.  You were having some trouble, and it affected the staff of the show.  We haven't brought it up on the air, and I was going to wait until the next time you're  in the studio so we could really spend some time with it, but I want to briefly mention  that you got into a behind-the-scenes fight with E-Rock because Fred from Brooklyn made 
[03:23:30]  a joke about you, and E-Rock laughed at him via the internet, and then you called E-Rock  and you were like, what the fuck, bro?  That's not cool.  It really, you got Joe, and you know, I like you, but you got what I would describe as  the butt hurt over it for a short period of time.  Everything's better now, but.  I did that day.  I can fully explain what happened.  In fact, I just made great amends with Fred from Brooklyn, and we hung out for many hours 
[03:24:00]  the other night.  I'm really serious.  That really happened.  You finally had to sit down with Fred from Brooklyn that you'll need to get your career  back on the right path.  We hung out at a, I was at a dance house, and I hung out with Fred from Brooklyn for  a while.  He came right up to me, and he was like, Joe, Fred from Brooklyn.  He goes, dude, I was just kidding, man.  I'm sorry.  I'm sorry.  And I was like, and I immediately, I was like, dude, and I've actually expressed this to  E-Rock.  We emailed like a couple weeks after we talked.  E-Rock emailed me and was like, dude, I'm sorry, man. 
[03:24:30]  I didn't mean to.  E-Rock emailed you?  What a pussy.  E-Rock emailed me.  Well, I called him.  We made up on the phone that day.  It wasn't like I called him like, fuck you, E-Rock.  Yeah, but when you called him, he had you on speakerphone.  Everybody in the office was listening.  Oh, I'm sure.  You know, we were all goofing.  I think somebody was playing Janis Joplin's Crybaby while you were talking. 
[03:25:00]  Thank you for, you know, God forbid there's ever a sincere moment between two people.  No, there shouldn't be.  Between men?  No.  That's not the place for that.  No, I know.  This is what happened.  And this is what I told Fred from Brooklyn.  And I expressed this to E-Rock, too, when we emailed afterwards.  I was like, dude, I'm sorry.  I way, way overreacted.  I was on the road at that point for like three weeks. 
[03:25:30]  I was on a southern, a southeastern tour where I was going all the way in through the southwest.  So I started in Atlanta and I went all the way up to Austin for a month straight.  And I was driving myself gig to gig.  And it was just like literally do the show, go to bed, get up the next morning, drive to the next city.  So that was like stressful enough.  And then, um, is that the Janis Joppa song?  Yeah, it is.  Yeah, it is, Joe.  Yeah, it is.  I don't know how that happened.  The mechanics are going very strange here. 
[03:26:00]  It's just weird how it happens.  Yeah.  But go on.  Go on with your story.  The point is that I was stressed and...  Shut up!  Oh, Jesus.  That's Rowland.  That's Rowland, that son of a bitch.  And, uh, I just got...  It was just a...  You have a bad morning.  You wake up.  You're somewhere in the middle like Mississippi.  You know, you didn't sell enough tickets the night before.  Whatever it is, and you're stressed and you see the wrong thing online and you flip out.  Right.  It was just like dumb.  It was just a bad moment.  It was. 
[03:26:30]  Um...  I'm only kidding, Joe.  I'm only kidding.  I know you are.  It's hard for me to hear you when it's playing.  That's the only reason I'm being quiet.  Oh.  No.  Yeah, let Janice sing.  Let her sing.  Yeah, let her sing.  I'm just kidding.  No.  Janice, you have no place here.  When you say this affected the staff...  Yes.  How much did it affect the staff?  Well, we all laughed a lot. 
[03:27:00]  Right.  We all get a...  I mean, you have to imagine.  That, like, when there's on-air drama, the people, like, we all eat it up.  Like, I go in and I just start stirring the shit and everybody...  Whether people around here admit it or not, like, everybody thinks I'm this big shit stirrer.  But every single person who works for this show is somewhere in the direct vicinity and  they're saying things into my ears and they're all just clamoring.  Every single person here loves it when people are fighting or arguing.  I love you, Joe.  I mean...  Roland is the worst of it all. 
[03:27:30]  So, I mean, you can imagine.  Oh, yeah.  When it happens off the air, it's even better.  Because you're like, holy shit, this is, like, real.  And so, I mean, we just all had a great time with it.  But I didn't call...  In my slight defense, because I know I overreacted a little bit.  I didn't call E-Rock, like, fuck you, man.  No.  I called them and I was just like, David, I'm just calling you so we don't have to discuss  this on Twitter where everybody can see it.  You called them because you weren't mad.  You were hurt.  Then that's okay.  I got a little hurt that day.  You were hurt.  How many disputes have I had with ONA staff members? 
[03:28:00]  Troy and I had our drama, and now we're cool again.  E-Rock and I had some drama, and now we're cool again.  I don't want it to happen ever again with anybody.  I can't wait.  I don't ever want it to happen.  I can't wait until the next time you're in here, because I'm sure you'll have some kind  of dispute with somebody.  I don't want to do that.  I don't, I have no interest in it.  Well, listen, I want everybody to go out to the Helium Comedy Club this weekend. 
[03:28:30]  Joe DeRosa, a very funny comedian, and he will be performing all weekend at Helium.  What's your Twitter address?  Joe DeRosa Comedy.  All right, so Joe DeRosa Comedy on Twitter, Helium Comedy Club.  Joe, I hope only for the best for you, and I appreciate you calling in to the After Open  Anthony Live show.  No, thanks for having me on, buddy.  I really appreciate the push, and I'll see you guys very soon.  All right, check him out at Helium.  Thank you very much, Joe DeRosa. 
[03:29:00]  Thanks, guys.  Bye.  All right.  Talk to you later.  He is funny on stage.  Everybody's got to go check him out at Helium.  The guests continue, because my pal, while we were on the phone with Joe DeRosa, my pal  from the World Wrestling Entertainment Company, Josh Matthews, walked in here.  How's it going, buddy?  Hi, how are you?  Do you have any idea what you walked in on?  A list of celebrities I see that I'm joining on this beautiful Thursday morning.  Well, yeah, I didn't get to talk to most of them.  I said hello to them. 
[03:29:30]  Yeah.  I like how you're trying to...  You really do just stir everything up, don't you?  No, I get to the bottom of things.  You do it in your personal life.  You do it on the radio.  You do it to me on Facebook.  You do it on Twitter.  I'm a person who likes truth, and I want to get to the bottom of things.  You like causing chaos and controversy.  No, that's not true, Josh.  I like to figure out exactly what the problem is, because you can't solve a problem until  everybody's being honest about what their problems are.  And you've got guys like Joe DeRosa and E-Rock, who obviously have huge problems with 
[03:30:00]  each other.  And they just won't admit it.  So sometimes you need a little prodding, you know?  A lot of people have a problem with you.  Nobody has a problem.  Who has a problem with me?  And then Josh is on Twitter yesterday, because Jim tweeted out a photo of me.  Yeah, can we get to the bottom of that, please?  I was wearing my...  It was atrocious.  ...blue shoes.  Blue suede shoes.  Yeah, they were suede.  Yeah.  And red socks.  Let me ask you first, before you get into the...  When you put those on, were you like, oh man, it might rain today?  No.  I shouldn't wear suede shoes. 
[03:30:30]  I checked the weather forecast before I chose what shoes I was going to wear.  So you have them on today, obviously, because it is a bit rainy in the New York.  New York City area.  No, I'm not wearing them today.  They're not all-weather shoes.  Gotcha.  They're for a nice summer day.  And ridiculous red socks.  And no, they were nice red socks.  They had white polka dots on them, but I retweeted it.  At Not Sam.  Were those happy socks?  On Twitter.  Do you know the brand, happy socks?  Yes, I know the brand.  They were not.  Okay.  First of all, the fact that you know sock brands means that you have no place to criticize  me for anything.  Well, one, my girlfriend works in fashion, as you know, and she designs socks. 
[03:31:00]  Quote, unquote, girlfriend.  Some people say beard, whatever it is.  Nobody says that.  She works in fashion, and she designs socks.  So you had on blue suede shoes, red and white.  The socks are from J.Crew.  Oh, I'm sorry.  Those are nice socks.  I'm sorry.  They were really nice.  And Josh is sitting there going, look at this ridiculous shoe sock combo.  Actually, I called it atrocious.  Meanwhile, he walks in here.  He's wearing a vest.  He's got thumb rings on.  I mean, God damn it, Josh.  For somebody, you got like, how many bracelets are you wearing? 
[03:31:30]  One, two, three, five.  There's no reason for a man to accessorize to the extent that you do.  Especially, I mean, it's one thing if you're going to accessorize and say, that's the way  I choose to live my life.  And I say, go for it.  You know, wave that flag proudly.  Whatever flag it is.  But, to then turn around and criticize somebody for taking pride in his shoe sock combination,  it's insanity.  We were also wondering why you decided to wear...  What do you have meetings about? 
[03:32:00]  My Sam Roberts information comes from Matt Fortune.  Oh.  So, he's the one who smartens me up to all this.  We've podcasted with him.  He's Josh's friend, who's a big O&A fan.  He's how we got to know each other.  Yeah, but he also mentioned that you wore this ridiculous outfit.  It wasn't a ridiculous outfit.  With camouflage shorts.  No, I didn't wear that with...  I would never wear high socks with shorts.  It's insane.  Oh, that's a fashion faux pas.  Yeah, you would know that. 
[03:32:30]  Don't pretend you don't know.  You got your little watch on.  I'm actually, I'm working right now on a fashion blog, and there'll be some things coming  forward.  Yeah.  So, I consider myself fashion forward thinking when it comes to...  How men should dress.  Well, this is...  Well, men of an appropriate age.  This is what I'm saying, then.  What are you saying?  You're not coming to me like Opie and Anthony and Jim were making fun of me like guys do.  It was Jim's tweet that I saw...  Right.  ...that really started this, all this controversy.  Because they were sitting there going, we don't care about what we wear, we don't care 
[03:33:00]  about our shoes, we don't care about any of this.  You're coming in here like Joan Rivers on the Fashion Police going, Joan Rivers!  No, you, those socks were just clashing with those.  This is what you need to replace...  And it's like Josh.  No, what you need to do is those blue suede shoes or just burn them.  Why?  The socks are fine, but the blue suede shoes and the red socks?  Were you celebrating Independence Day a couple days later?  Yeah, well, believe it or not, blue, red, and white?  Those colors go together.  You know who thought that?  Those colors don't run.  Our founding fathers.  If you want to let terrorists win, go ahead. 
[03:33:30]  But I think that our founding fathers had something when they put that together.  I don't need you criticizing anything I wear.  You got a faux hawk, for God's sake.  Okay?  Now we're going to point fingers about hair.  Well, you started it.  Before we get into this, all this yelling back and forth at each other, I do want to  thank you for the gifts that you're going to be giving me later for the golf outing  that I'm playing in tomorrow down in Philly.  I appreciate all that.  Oh, right.  There's a charity golf outing in Philly.  Yes, and actually, you guys, you were talking to Joe DeRosa moments ago about being in Philly, 
[03:34:00]  and Steve and Preston, or Preston and Steve, those guys actually, one of them live on  this golf course that we're playing on, and they were asked to kind of be a part of this,  and no response.  Really?  And here I am in New York, 90 miles away from Philly, and you're letting me come on  here and talk about that off-riding a little bit.  Of course.  It's a wonderful, you know, it's for a wonderful cause and everything.  So F, Preston and Steve, is what I have to say.  They stopped talking to Joe DeRosa because he did their show, and he mentioned that he  loves doing O&A.  I guess they have a big problem with us from back in the day. 
[03:34:30]  Yeah.  Because they didn't invite him back.  They said, nah, we're going to pass.  You know, I was here.  I was sitting right next to you when Joe was on.  You know what that was for, Josh?  Bringing it all forward.  The audience.  Sometimes I don't just think about you.  I think about the fact that we're broadcasting.  Well, whatever.  That's me.  Well, I'm a guest on this show.  Well, I'm a professional broadcaster.  I like to think of it all as about me.  I don't have an agenda like you may have.  It's not about you.  It's about me.  I wanted to talk about fashion.  I wanted to talk about money in the bank on Sunday.  And I wanted to talk about the golf outing.  Well, tell me what the charity is all about. 
[03:35:00]  Honestly, I don't know.  Okay.  To be honest with you.  But it is a charity.  It's more for, I believe, a little league.  So, Marty Miller, who is a gentleman that you know that I work with, he puts it all together  every year.  It happens in the summer.  There's usually a few WWE personality on the course that afternoon.  I don't know who will be there tomorrow.  Sgt. Slaughter?  I don't know if Sarge will be there.  Bobo Brazil?  I don't know about him either.  Almost definitely not for Bobo, I think.  I will be there.  You were invited, but you are so unathletic that you declined the invitation. 
[03:35:30]  I couldn't fit it into my busy schedule.  You couldn't find the right outfit.  I don't know how to.  I have these blue suede golf shoes, and I don't know what to do with them.  These aren't golf socks.  These are casual socks.  They're happy socks.  I have nothing to wear.  Well, tell Jess that you need some golf socks.  I was thinking.  You guys can make a trip to the outlets.  I was thinking the other day that I do need to learn how to golf, because I've been realizing,  because part of the whole thing with the shoes was like, in my mind, I'm thinking  I want to get away from sneakers.  Okay.  Because I'll be 30. 
[03:36:00]  Now, wait a second.  Do you wear sneakers with jeans?  Yeah, I wear sneakers with everything.  Okay, see, I find it terrible.  To wear sneakers with jeans.  What do you wear sneakers with?  Shorts.  That's it?  That's it.  But all I wear is like Chuck Taylor, Converse All-Stars.  Yeah.  Look at, you got like, well, let me see your socks.  Oh, then I can't lift my leg down.  Oh, Jesus Christ.  E-Rock, get in here right now.  What's wrong with these socks?  I need to go to an unbiased source, okay?  And I have said a lot of terrible things about E-Rock, so he's not going to take my side just 
[03:36:30]  because.  This morning, I went for a run on the Hudson.  I wore sneakers.  Okay.  And Nike Elite socks.  I think that's what they're called.  E-Rock, I need your opinion on this.  E-Rock!  What's up, buddy?  Don't look yet.  Sit down next to the microphone.  All right.  Because I was telling Josh that you will not take my side just because.  Hi, how are you?  Can I say hello to E-Rock for a moment, please?  No.  You can't say hello to E-Rock.  It's very selfish, but for sure.  You're not going to take my side just because.  Because I've said so many horrible things about you.  Yes.  You'll give me an honest opinion.  Because you're a guy with integrity.  Don't, why would you say it? 
[03:37:00]  I thought that's where we were going with it.  No, of course not.  I apologize.  Josh was criticizing my socks yesterday.  Yes.  They were red with white polka dots.  There's a picture of them.  On Jim Norton's Twitter.  Yeah.  At Jim Norton.  And of course, at NotSam.  I retweeted.  Josh, lift your foot up on that table.  Which side?  Whatever side you want.  Let's see if I can do this.  There you go.  Oh!  You're telling me, E-Rock.  Tell me.  What is wrong with these?  Who has worse socks, really?  Really?  Describe the socks to the listening audience. 
[03:37:30]  Yeah, it's radio, guys.  They look like something Oompa Loompas wear.  What colors are they?  Orange, green, purple.  Do we have enough time to list all the colors?  There's a few more in there, but it moves so fast it's a blur.  You're wearing rainbow striped socks.  With light brown leather shoes.  Yeah, I would say the base color is orange.  There is no base color.  It's rainbow stripes.  No, because the top is orange.  That's how you find the base of the...  See?  That's orange.  You have no...  Whatever, dude.  Eric, does he have any...  Why does anybody know base colors for a sock? 
[03:38:00]  You gotta be a little fashion forward, Eric.  This is where I'll side with Josh.  Thanks for stopping by.  No, E-Rock, don't...  Yeah.  That's what I got.  E-Rock has no place.  He's got white ankle socks.  I like those Nike high tops, though.  He's got no place on your upcoming Josh Matthews fashion blog.  No.  Which, by the way, should not get you any respect from pro wrestling fans.  Actually, it will.  Yeah.  Does JBL like it?  Because...  No, but I mentioned it.  This headset keeps messing up, but I'll power through.  No, it's the guy who's using it, but go ahead.  I'll power through.  I'll power through.  Actually, I mentioned this idea to a certain WWE champion who thought it was a great idea. 
[03:38:30]  His name is John Cena.  Yeah, because John Cena is a pillar of fashion.  Yeah.  He wears shorts every week.  Well, you know...  He's got cargo shorts.  Right.  All right, move on, Sam.  Let's talk about something else.  That's what I thought.  E-Rock, tell me the truth.  He has worse socks than me yesterday.  I didn't think yours could be beat, but he did it.  Thank you.  Beat in a better way.  Yay.  Incorrect.  Incorrect.  And those will be up on Instagram, at not Sam.  Do you have an Instagram? 
[03:39:00]  Of course I do.  I'm all over the map.  Do you have Pinterest?  I signed up for Pinterest, but I don't know what it is.  I never started using it.  To me, I think that Pinterest really is, and correct me if I'm wrong, it's for girls, correct?  It's a girl thing.  It is, right?  It is.  One of our interns, all she does is Pinterest.  So you just pin photos on a wall.  She gets ideas.  Like, she makes furniture and recipes and things off that wall.  And then I hear girls say, like, I have Thinspiration photos on my Pinterest wall.  I have no idea what that is.  Yeah, I guess you pin photos of, like, yourself, like, thinner, and then you, and then that's 
[03:39:30]  Thinspiration.  That's motivation.  You should post photos, like, you should crop photos of you, like, muscular, like, big.  Just pictures of me with massive arms and protein powders next to it.  Muscle-spiration, yeah, yeah.  I don't do that.  You know what?  I'm very happy with the way I am.  Well, that makes one of you.  But I will say that the reason, like, I was, I'm trying to get off sneakers.  Oh, yeah, back to this convo.  I'll be 30 years old in September. 
[03:40:00]  Oh, happy birthday.  And it's like, it's time, you know, to start making some changes.  Let's adult up a little bit.  Yeah.  You know, Jay-Z doesn't wear football jerseys anymore, does he?  No.  He dresses like a gentleman.  Yes.  You know, GQ.  I take very much pride.  Very much pride?  Does that make sense?  No.  A lot of pride in dressing like a gentleman.  Like a gentleman.  A gentleman.  With thumb rings.  A gentleman who wears a thumb ring.  And a lot of accessories.  Yeah.  But, you know, you see me a lot with vests or a jacket, things of that nature.  I mean, to tell you the truth, I respect it.  Thank you.  I was taking shots because you were taking shots, and that's what I do. 
[03:40:30]  But I respect it.  We can get back to a level playing field.  Yeah.  But, again, yeah, I don't think that you should wear sneakers with jeans.  I just really, it really bothers me.  Look today.  That looks great.  Thank you.  It looks phenomenal.  I got shoe shoes on with my jeans.  Does your belt match those shoes?  I don't have a belt on yet.  I'm not there yet.  Okay.  I'll get there.  All right.  But, um...  Jess really knew that she was starting on the ground level with you, right?  I mean, it was only potential when Jess showed up.  And in the last eight years that we've known each other, it's remained strictly potential. 
[03:41:00]  But still, there's room.  There's room for growth.  There's always room for growth.  Mm-hmm.  But I was thinking that I need to learn how to golf is the other thing.  Yeah, me too.  Because that's where invitations like you come in, like business invitations start coming in,  and people say, oh, we're going to play golf.  We're going to do...  I don't know how to play any sports, but I feel like I could learn how to play golf at least adequately enough  that if a person said, you know, us adults are going to play golf, I could do that.  Did you play any sports as a kid? 
[03:41:30]  T-ball is horrible.  And T-ball, nobody should be horrible at because the ball doesn't move.  It's stationary.  You get that that's how golf is played, right?  Does he understand this?  Yeah, but on T-ball, the ball is much bigger.  Right.  It's way up high.  Right.  And you get to just swing a bat at it.  That's pretty...  You just pretty much described golf.  Golf is way down low, and the ball is small.  And you put it on a T, though.  You T it up.  T-ball.  T it up in golf.  That's the only similarity.  Literally.  Okay.  All right.  Literally.  Well, take lessons.  You want to take them together?  Yeah, I do. 
[03:42:00]  I'm actually going to start CrossFit, too.  CrossFit.  That's on my list of things to do.  What's CrossFit?  CrossFit's like that training that people do.  It's like training your whole body.  It's like cardio and weights all in one.  P90X?  P90X.  I don't know if that's CrossFit.  I don't think it is.  That's what...  But like, you know, truck tires and you're swinging sledgehammers.  Oh, like the UFC guys do.  They always show them working out.  They're flipping tires up.  They're pulling ropes.  Sure.  They do burpees.  That's like a thing.  What's that?  Like when you pat them on the back? 
[03:42:30]  Nah.  Get the gas out?  That's like a child.  Yeah.  That's what I was thinking.  Burpees.  Who needs burpees?  What's burpees?  Don't go to CrossFit.  I think they're like those up-downs that you used to do in gym class.  I'm not an expert on the subject.  So I can't look for a big man to say, I need burpees.  Hello, sir.  Can I have a burpee?  My belly hurts.  Can you give me burpees?  That's horrible.  Yeah.  So SoulCycle probably wouldn't be the spot for me?  I don't know what that is either.  All the women are going to SoulCycle now.  And I guess it's this place that's just like exercise bikes. 
[03:43:00]  Okay.  But like, you know, a trainer comes, they put on music,  and I guess they bike to rhythm and stuff.  Like spin class?  Yeah, kind of.  That's been going on for years.  But it's only that.  Like it's not a spin class at a gym.  Like SoulCycle just does classes on cycles.  So you walk into the room, and it's all bikes?  Just bikes.  Like those kickboxing places?  I'm sure you've seen one driving by.  I've never been to a kickboxing place.  You've never been to a gym?  Right.  But there's a kickbox, like CKO kickboxing.  You drive by them, and it's just, you just see those big heavy bags. 
[03:43:30]  And that's all it is.  It's like four classes a day.  Okay.  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Exactly.  And that's it.  Like it's these little storefronts, but I don't know.  So yeah, you don't know how to play golf?  No, I played, I think two years ago, I think I played like over a hundred times in the summer.  And it's just a game that you have to play over and over again to get good at.  But I'm at the point now where I'd like to take lessons and really understand how to play the game.  Yeah, I'm good with just like...  Miniature golf.  Miniature golf.  If I could learn how to play miniature golf well, or at least adequately, I'm done with my training. 
[03:44:00]  Cotton candy, you walk around with that?  That would be great.  You're like a 30-year-old child.  Can you swing with one hand?  Just a little ice cream cone in the other?  I don't think that would be fine.  So tell me...  What's that?  What's going on in the world of professional wrestling?  Josh is, of course, the voice of WWE Main Event.  You disappeared from SmackDown.  You used to be the guy who did commentary on SmackDown.  What happened?  We made some changes.  And I like the changes that are made.  Main Event's a really cool show. 
[03:44:30]  It's on Wednesday nights.  It's an hour long.  It's on Ion Television.  Is that why you like Main Event?  Then it's half as much work.  And you're just like, well, I'm done now.  It goes pretty quickly.  To be honest with you, this is good for me.  It goes quickly because typically there's a longer match on that show.  A very competitive, longer contest.  I think last night Antonio Cesaro had a great match with Dolph Ziggler.  I don't know if you were able to watch the show or not.  I don't know if you had a DVR.  If you have it on your DVR, check it out.  It's a cool show. 
[03:45:00]  And I get to work with Miz and Cody Rhodes.  And having those guys on commentary with me is really cool.  It's a great dynamic.  And then Monday I get to be Mr. WWE App, as I've coined myself.  You coined yourself?  Yes.  Because the app is so cool.  Because I sort of compare it to the Red Zone channel, the NFL's Red Zone channel.  Where they just go like, touchdown, touchdown, touchdown, touchdown.  Right.  It's always action-packed.  We go to commercial on USA for Monday Night Raw.  And then we come up live on the app. 
[03:45:30]  And I remember a few weeks ago when Daniel Bryan, when the match was called.  And we went to break and was like, what just happened?  Well, during the break we had that story.  Daniel Bryan walked right by the app set.  And we were able to tell kind of a piece of that story as to what transpired.  USA must love that.  I don't think they have an issue.  But listen.  Listen.  Tell me.  When you're watching Raw, and you have your iPad in front of you.  You're right.  When USA goes to commercial, instead of picking up your remote to change the channel, you're 
[03:46:00]  on your app.  You're on your iPad.  You're on your phone.  You wrestling guys have a spin on everything.  That's perfect.  You're hearing USA's plugs.  You're hearing the commercials.  Yeah.  And you look up.  I mean.  You're like, not only do I know what happened to Daniel Bryan, but I would love a burger from  Sonic right now.  And if Suits is coming up in a couple of weeks, I'll watch that as well.  Yeah.  But the problem is, not the problem, how often do you watch TV and just watch TV?  I never just watch a movie.  Right.  And I get yelled at all the time by Nicole.  She'll be like, can you just watch this?  You're on your phone.  You're on your deal.  Nicole, for the morning mashup?  No.  No.  Don't get me started on the morning mashup. 
[03:46:30]  Why?  Because it's the worst thing in the history of radio.  It is?  Oh, it's terrible.  It is terrible.  I want to drive my car off the road when I'm listening to the morning mashup.  Really?  It is schtick radio.  Now, is that because they're playing that Iconopop song and you're going to just crash  your car into a bridge?  No, I like that song.  Yeah.  My new favorite song is Miley Cyrus.  Josh, I would love to hate on you for that.  What is it?  We Can't Stop, Don't Stop, Party.  It's a great song.  It's phenomenal.  You don't like the morning mashup?  It's awful.  It is.  Oh, it's atrocious radio.  They're friends of mine. 
[03:47:00]  You know that.  But Nicole's a friend of yours.  Yeah, she's closer than mine.  I love the other day.  I think you sent me a photo of their promo shot here in the building somewhere.  They're all smiling and happy.  Why wouldn't you be happy?  It's terrible.  Oh, Jesus.  It's terrible.  E-Rock, did you see this comment?  No, not at all.  This is horrible.  I'm sorry.  And look, I just call it like I see it.  They have their own show in the morning.  Yeah.  And it's just awful.  You don't like it.  No.  What don't you like about it?  It's, I feel like you keep looking at the door like one of them are going to come in  and be offended. 
[03:47:30]  And if they are offended, it's okay.  Because they're really that bad.  Somebody should sit them down.  Somebody should sit them down and be like, listen, guys, just stop doing sticky radio.  They may.  What is the game that Nicole plays where she guesses questions against?  Nicole versus the streets?  Yeah.  You're not a fan?  That's new and original.  Oh, Jesus Christ, Josh.  I'd love to be in the meeting when they came up with that.  It was like, hey, listen, we're going to ask questions to the general public, and then  we're going to ask Nicole those questions.  They're going to be like common knowledge questions. 
[03:48:00]  Right.  And we'll have an audience member calling and see if we can get it right.  You don't think it's funny?  Genius!  Sign me up for that.  That's sarcasm.  Sarcasm in its sentence was at its worst.  What?  Opie, earlier this week, it was like on Tuesday, said that he actually listened to the morning  mashup.  Okay.  He said they put on a good radio show.  They play decent music.  Right.  That's it.  Period.  That was the end of the sentence.  It's terrible.  It's atrocious.  It's wretched.  Put that in their promo. 
[03:48:30]  Hey, listen to the morning mashup.  Well, this is not a celebrity endorsement, is it?  It's bad.  Oh.  Oh, Josh.  How did we get off track?  What were we talking about?  I don't know.  You had this vendetta against the mashup that you had to get out there.  We were on a good little run there, and then we got off track.  You started attacking my friends.  What happened?  Joe in New Jersey.  Yeah.  Basically, CrossFit is the morning mashup of exercise.  It's terrible.  It's bad?  It's horrible.  Basically, they have what's called boxes. 
[03:49:00]  The guy who started CrossFit just will let anybody who wants to throw up a banner do it in a small little storefront as long as he pays them.  There's no form.  It's high volume.  And if you're looking to get into exercise, you don't want to start with CrossFit.  You don't want to do it anyway at any time.  It's horrible.  Okay, let's just say this.  Any form of exercise is a good thing.  Yeah.  I mean, CrossFit, even if Joe from New Jersey, thanks for the call, says it's terrible, it's better still than sitting on the couch. 
[03:49:30]  Walking to the gym is something.  Yeah.  It is something.  You're something.  We've only got a couple minutes left.  Time flies with you.  Well, I'll be back tomorrow.  You coming back?  Are you going to do this show tomorrow?  I always do.  Well, except for Wednesday.  Let's do the morning mashup.  Jesus Christ, Josh.  No, I won't be here tomorrow.  I'll be in Philadelphia at the golf outing.  All right.  So, Philadelphia.  How much time do I have?  That's tomorrow.  Two minutes.  And then Sunday, of course, is WWE's Money in the Bank in Philly.  What were you thinking when WWE has this great debut, the Wyatt family comes out, and they've been promoing these guys forever. 
[03:50:00]  Yeah.  And they're this crazy redneck family that they've been showing vignettes for for weeks.  I think crazy and redneck is trite, but okay.  What do you mean trite?  I think you could use better words to describe.  They're sort of bizarre.  They're eerie.  You don't think they're crazy rednecks?  No.  Why not?  One, from what we know about them, I mean, we haven't seen a lot. 
[03:50:30]  But anyway, go ahead.  Go back to your story.  I know you've got a little bit of time left.  You're giving me that, oh, look, we've got another time left.  They seem like crazy rednecks to me.  Okay.  What's your point, Sam?  But they come out very angry this morning.  And, well, you're getting under my skin.  They come out, and the guy who is the head of the Wyatt family used to be known as Husky Harris.  He's Bray Wyatt now.  Right, which, I mean, I don't know who named him Husky Harris, but...  Okay, why does this bother everybody so much?  That's what I want to know.  People get rebranded and repackaged.  I just, no, the original name Husky Harris is a funny name. 
[03:51:00]  Okay.  Like, you know, like Fatty Fats was already taken.  You have to name him Husky Harris because he's a husky guy.  That's not cool.  Curtis Axel didn't have a great name.  He didn't.  Now he's Curtis Axel.  What do you think, as a guy who's in the company, you're a performer, and your vested interest is in seeing these storylines do well,  when, you know, they come out and they put this much time and they do a good job introducing this group,  but the fans start chanting Husky Harris at him as if, like, ah, we're smarter than you, we already know what's going on.  I think there was, um, I don't think anybody predicted that to happen. 
[03:51:30]  I don't think so.  It was such a cool moment, and especially being, um, backstage, and at this point we're filming everything.  We're shooting the reaction of the guys as the Wyatt family make their first appearance.  When you're shooting the stuff backstage, and you're filming guys' reaction, and like you said, Daniel Bryan walks over and you get the story from him.  Yeah.  How much of that is storyline, and how much of that is, no, we're just going to film everything.  No, it's just filmed.  I mean, it is, it is like, we're going to break, press record, let's go. 
[03:52:00]  Sometimes, I mean, there's a few minute delay in some of them.  Some of them are actually live, live.  Like, we are, you know, this is the app.  This just happened.  Daniel Bryan's match just got, uh.  And if something in reality happens that's good, they'll just make it into a storyline.  That's the idea, I guess.  Sure.  But it's, it's become more news.  We're reporting on things that happened.  So when the Wyatts did what they did to Kane Monday night, it was more like, I don't think that, we were right behind the curtain in Baltimore.  It's a weird building, so we're like right there, watching the show. 
[03:52:30]  So when they're doing the deal and the chanting or whatever, I think the emphasis of what the superstars saw and the divas saw,  was what those guys did to Kane.  But what did you think, as a human being, that just got, like, were you, like, annoyed?  It was kind of like, eh.  Like, what are you guys doing?  Like, are you looking at the crowd?  Like, you're not doing your job now.  But they have their own, um, the prerogative to do whatever they want.  I mean, they start, yes, yes, yes.  You know, uh, Fandango, the night after WrestleMania.  Crowds are, they're, they're weird.  You didn't have a feeling, like, this is why we, you can't have nice things. 
[03:53:00]  This is why we don't do nice things for you, because you ruined them.  No, no, I didn't have that feeling.  And I don't think that that's going to be something that's going to develop.  I think that may have been a one-time thing where you heard that.  I think the Wyatt family are certainly going to make their own mark in WWE.  Well, listen.  What?  Money in the Bank is this Sunday.  Sunday!  It's going to be a great pay-per-view.  Yeah.  Mark Henry versus John Cena.  Talk about it.  That's been well done.  Great.  Really well done.  I mean, Mark, that was something that, in the locker room area, where, tears. 
[03:53:30]  When something like that happens.  People thought Mark Henry was retiring.  Mark Henry comes out.  He does this great retirement speech, he brings up his family, and then he ends up turning  on John Cena.  It's classic pro wrestling.  Does Mark Henry go?  Do people, are the people in the locker room, are they aware that, oh yeah, this is going  to be a great spin, I can't wait to watch this?  Or are people not really aware of other people's storylines?  So they're just watching going, I guess the guy's retiring.  Holy shit!  I saw people during the day say goodbye to Mark.  Wow.  They legitimately thought, like, this is it.  I mean, and you could, that's believable.  Yeah.  Because the guy's been around for, he's a veteran. 
[03:54:00]  So it was believable that night that Mark Henry was saying goodbye to WWE.  That's incredible.  Yeah.  John Cena, Mark Henry, the Mind the Bank matches.  And then Monday will be in Brooklyn for Raw.  So it's going to be a big week.  And, of course, the WWE Performance Center opened up this week.  Huge.  Yeah, it's a big week for everybody.  And I'll see you, by the way, on Sunday and Monday.  Oh!  You know that's happening.  Are you bringing your lovely wife?  Of course I am.  Okay, good.  I'll just talk to her, then.  Josh, when we talk about accessorizing and fashion and stuff, don't forget what every  guy needs. 
[03:54:30]  Razors.  You need good razors, right?  You need to keep a close shave.  Oh, that was a terrible segue into your plug.  You should go work for the morning mashup.  It's not a plug.  What I'm trying to tell you is your razor doesn't need a vibrating handle.  It's what you should be reporting on.  It doesn't need a back scratcher.  It doesn't need 10 blades.  Seriously.  All joking aside.  Josh, have you noticed the price you pay for a new razor blade?  No, Sam.  How much?  15 bucks or so?  How much?  A 15, 20 dollars.  Is that in pesos?
