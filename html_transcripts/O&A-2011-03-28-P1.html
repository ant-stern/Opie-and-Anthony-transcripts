<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show began with the hosts – Opie, Anthony Cumia, and Jim Norton – introducing themselves with self-deprecating humor (father, alcoholic, comedian respectively).  They briefly dismissed Charlie Sheen's publicized issues.  Their conversation then shifted to their weekend activities, leading to a lengthy discussion of Jim Norton's viewing of Bill Maher's "Religulous."  Norton detailed humorous encounters depicted in the documentary, including a priest admitting the Catholic faith was "bullshit" and a former gay man claiming to be "saved by Jesus."  The discussion included a detailed account of Maher's interactions with various religious figures from different faiths, including Catholicism, Islam, and Mormonism.  This segued into a discussion of another documentary Norton watched, "White Horse," about a man returning to his Chernobyl-adjacent childhood home, highlighting the film's eerie atmosphere and the emotional impact on the subject. The conversation then jumped to the Japanese nuclear crisis and concerns about contaminated seafood, followed by a discussion of the Islanders' NHL playoff loss, Norton's season tickets woes, and the Nassau Coliseum's parking situation. The hosts also debated the dominance of the UConn women's basketball team and the general lack of attention given to women's sports, with a humorous aside on the presumed audience for such games.  A caller from Ohio described Cleveland Crush lingerie football, prompting reactions from the hosts regarding the visuals and physicality of the sport. The discussion then moved to video games, specifically criticizing the graphics of the new Tiger Woods golf game and MLB 2K11, comparing them unfavorably to Madden NFL.  They also discussed the overall state of video game graphics and desired improvements.  Complaints about the Tiger Woods game's graphics and underwhelming cover art concluded this portion.

The next segment focused heavily on video games—NHL 2011, Tiger Woods golf, and NBA 2K—with detailed critiques of their graphics and gameplay.  Tiger Woods' golfing decline was speculated upon, followed by a lengthy discussion about the evolution of data storage technologies.  The hosts expressed considerable frustration with SiriusXM's lack of interns, resulting in them personally running errands, including coffee and breakfast, with accompanying profanity-laced complaints directed at specific SiriusXM management. They mentioned Norm Macdonald as an upcoming guest. A caller defended Tiger Woods, leading to a discussion of a young woman he was involved with and a personal anecdote from one host regarding past relationships with sisters.  The hosts then described seeing Nick DiPaolo's stand-up act, recounting his interactions with hecklers.  The segment concluded with promotions for their upcoming "Antisocial" stand-up show and the documentary "Fat, Sick, and Nearly Dead" about juicing.  The segment was filled with profanity and discussions of sex and relationships.

The following segment began with a movie discussion, followed by a description of prostitution business cards found in Queens, highlighting their quality and the distribution methods employed primarily by Guatemalan women.  The conversation then transitioned to the new social networking app "Color," its features, and privacy concerns. A news story about Abercrombie & Fitch selling push-up bras for young girls sparked a debate on the sexualization of children. This led to a discussion of Donald Trump's stance on Obama's birth certificate and a critique of a segment from The View featuring Whoopi Goldberg and Elisabeth Hasselbeck, during which the hosts played a clip and criticized both women. The discussion expanded on the validity of Obama's birth certificate and speculation about other presidents facing similar scrutiny, including a caller's claim about FDR.  The hosts analyzed a purported online image of Obama's birth certificate, questioning its authenticity.  A short clip of Jesse Ventura expressing his conspiracy theories regarding HAARP technology, JFK's assassination, and government control was played. The segment concluded with an interview with Joe Cross, the subject of "Fat, Sick, and Nearly Dead," discussing his weight loss journey and the challenges of maintaining a healthy lifestyle.

This interview with Joe Cross centered on his 60-day juice cleanse undertaken to alleviate chronic urticaria and angioedema. He detailed the debilitating effects of his prescription medication, including osteoporosis and a "moon face," and explained his reasoning for the juice cleanse, highlighting the nutrient absorption speed of liquids over solids. He described his cross-country journey filming the documentary, noting differences in American and Australian media consumption. He emphasized leading by example.  The conversation included graphic descriptions of his condition, including hives on his genitals, and humorous anecdotes about forgetting how to chew after 60 days. He discussed his increased energy levels and the effects of different juices on bowel movements. He addressed the cost of juicing and its long-term benefits, sharing anecdotes about people featured in his documentary, including a truck driver and his brother who suffered a heart attack.  The conversation touched on the American healthcare system, pharmaceutical advertising, government-corporate relations, the 2008 financial crisis, and corporate tax avoidance, interspersed with humorous banter and calls from listeners sharing their weight loss struggles.  The interview concluded with a discussion of his filmmaking experience and a brief description of Uluru (Ayers Rock).

The final segment began with a discussion about bridge climbing in Australia, speculating on its height and the experience, with varying degrees of fear expressed by the hosts.  Oprah and Gayle King's experience was mentioned. This was followed by a continuation of the Joe Cross interview, with Opie admitting to being moved to tears by the film's ending.  The discussion covered the film's availability and future plans, including a potential trip to Australia for the hosts, concluding with another on-air personality, Jimmy, plugging his upcoming comedy shows.

[00:03:30]  At the controls, Greg Hughes, a father. 
[00:04:00]  I am amazed it lasted this long.  Anthony Cumia, an alcoholic.  Holy mother of God.  And Jim Norton, a comedian.  There's no positives out of this thing,  except for everybody's blood.  The three men make up the Opie and Anthony Show,  a popular radio program known for its cringe style of entertainment  and having very few minutes.  Oh, my God.  Okay, no, this is getting really intense now.  It starts funny and it gets very uncomfortable.  In the past, they have been accused of multiple FCC violations 
[00:04:30]  and have even gotten their show suspended from satellite radio.  You couldn't have picked a fucking more self-destructive show.  Yeah, the crazier, the better, yeah, yeah.  What are you, 19?  I'm 19.  Delicious.  You made Springer uncomfortable.  Do you know how hard that is to do?  Thank God this show is on radio.  Everything you are about to hear is real.  Real people, real excitement.  Hey, let's go fuck and have a good time.  What the fuck?  Get ready to experience the thrill of a lifetime.  This is the Opie and Anthony Show.  Just sit back and enjoy the show.  But enough of this palaver. 
[00:05:00]  Let's get the show on the road.  Let's do this.  Yay.  Sit back and enjoy the show.  Enjoy the show.  Is he still happening, this Charlie Sheen?  I have no idea.  Stop following.  Stop fucking looking at anything in the news.  Stop doing any Twittering and nothing.  I have no idea.  You're not into his gnarly-isms?  No, I'm done.  Done with the Charlie Sheen?  Completely.  I couldn't even add anything new right now because I don't know.  It was fun.  It was a fun ride.  For me, it was a fun week with him. 
[00:05:30]  Yeah, yeah.  Everybody was into it.  It was like a gimmick.  I think he's about a month in now.  I mean, if you're still like...  Yeah, if you're still doing all this shit.  I guess there are a lot of people buying into it because that road show of his sold out everywhere.  When does that start?  Soon?  I have no idea.  Again, I can't tell you anything new about this guy.  It's going to be across the street, though.  Maybe we take a peek.  Maybe not so much.  I would take a peek.  Would you?  Yeah, because I think it's going to be a complete disaster.  I don't think that's his thing, you know?  No, it's not. 
[00:06:00]  He needs to get his dumb TV sitcom back and shut the fuck up.  He needs to hit his mark, read his lines.  I don't think he can just riff.  At this point, he'll be doing Two and a Half Men next year.  Yeah.  Don't worry.  Two and a Half Men friends.  Huh?  Friends of the show.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Friends of Two and a Half Men.  He'll be back.  Of course he will.  How was everyone's weekend?  Oh, just much too short.  You know how it is.  Oh, my...  I slept.  You slept?  I pretty much slept.  I think I needed sleep so badly that I just, I don't know if I'm like Friday night, slept 
[00:06:30]  like crazy, and then Saturday I just slept, and Sunday...  It was a weekend for sleeping, just because it's winter again here in New York.  Yeah, it got really cold, and fuck that.  Yeah, it was a blast of Arctic air.  Didn't do anything.  Watched a few documentaries, which I always enjoy watching.  I saw Religulous, which is Bill Maher's movie on religion.  Welcome to 2009. 
[00:07:00]  What'd you think?  I know, it was...  I begged you to watch that years ago.  I know, it's timeless, though.  It is timeless.  I wasn't kind of in the mood to watch it, and it's not any dated stuff like that.  You know my feelings about Bill Maher.  I can't stand Bill Maher.  Yeah, I'm not a fan of his.  But I gotta tell you...  But he's a smart guy.  It was...  I won't even say that.  He's fucking smarmy, and he's...  He's know-it-all smart.  He thinks he fucking knows everything.  Hold on, hold on.  I'm not saying he's smart like I agree with him.  You can tell he's smart, but he's also swarmy. 
[00:07:30]  Smarmy.  Smarmy, right.  Smarmy.  He's just like...  He's Bill Maher, and that's why I don't like him.  The kind of guy he is, that type of fucking attitude, I just can't stand it.  Lib and glib.  That's what he is.  What do you think of Religulous, though?  I thought the movie was fucking great.  Yeah, I thought so, too.  He just goes all over the world and points out these inconsistencies and ridiculousness  of religions all over the world, and not confronts people, but just has these open, honest discussions 
[00:08:00]  with people about their religion and how silly a lot of this stuff seems with the magic and  the invisible things and the big giant god thing.  I wish you told me you were going to see this, so I would have watched it again.  So I could be in on this discussion.  I mean, what I do remember is the priest at the Vatican basically saying, ah, it's all bullshit.  That guy was hysterical.  Who is that guy, though? 
[00:08:30]  I don't know, but Bill Maher at one point goes, ah, well, are you going to take your  collar off and throw it on the ground?  He goes, I don't wear a collar.  Right.  He's like that guy in Caddyshack.  Yeah.  But you're a priest.  I guess he's a priest at the Vatican.  Yeah.  And he's basically saying, ah, I'm a man.  My name's Fred.  The whole thing is crap, he said.  Yeah, he said the whole thing's crap.  All the ritual and the big giant buildings at the Vatican that are paid for by the followers  and shit.  It's all bullshit.  And if there was this Jesus guy, he wouldn't be up on spending all the people's money on 
[00:09:00]  these big buildings for a few people to live in to preach his word.  It would go to, you know, the poor people.  And then I remember the Muslim guy with his cell phone ringing.  I remember that.  And it was playing cashmere.  Yeah.  Dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun.  It was fucking great.  I'm rude.  And I guess he was up there in the religion.  Yeah.  More or less.  I mean, I think he found a low-level Muslim guy, I believe. 
[00:09:30]  Yeah, he found a couple of Muslim people who were just completely making excuses for the  violence in the religion, never really fessing up to the fact that, you know, it does in  the Koran say some horrific things to do to infidels, and they were making excuses for that.  Catholic religion, Christians with the gays, he got into that whole thing.  Oh, the Mormons.  Yeah, yeah, the Mormons.  That was my favorite part of Religious.  Yeah.  The Mormons.  And the clips he threw in, in between, like, shit that was being said, like, movie clips, 
[00:10:00]  clips from old gladiator movies.  Yeah, yeah.  Where him and that gay guy made a joke, or the former gay guy that got fixed through God  and he wasn't gay anymore.  Oh, I forgot about that.  And they start laughing, and it's like this uncomfortable, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.  And then they just cut to this old gladiator movie with these two gladiators with their  arms around each other going, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, laughing all clad in leather and shit.  It was hysterical.  That guy was creepy.  He was a gay guy.  He was gay.  And he swears that he was saved by Jesus. 
[00:10:30]  Saved by Jesus.  He's married.  He's not gay anymore.  He's been married 14 years.  He's got kids, but he has the gay talk.  Yeah, that wasn't really...  He still has kind of a talk, this effeminate little thing going on, this lilt.  That was an awkward conversation.  It was.  Very.  Very.  And wasn't there a hug going on, or he wanted a hug?  Yeah, he wanted to shake hands.  Bill Maher, like, stuck his hand out to shake his hand, and the guy went, like, hugs.  I give everyone hugs.  And he came around and gave Bill Maher a big bear hug.  All right.  And then Bill Maher pointed down.  He goes, do you have a heart on me?  Yeah. 
[00:11:00]  Like, I hate Bill Maher, and I was upset that it was so good that I was laughing.  Yeah, there's times you get mad at yourself that you're laughing at Bill Maher.  That you're laughing at people that you can't stand.  I hate when that happens, but I had to give it to him.  The movie was very well done.  I think I'm kind of conflicted with the guy.  Yeah, yeah.  What about...  It's all coming back to me.  What about...  What about...  Is it a congressman?  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Who doesn't believe...  In creationism.  He doesn't believe in evolution, and he truly... 
[00:11:30]  Yeah, or not evolution.  Yeah, he believes in creation.  He believes in creation, and he believes the earth is only...  6,000 years old.  Yeah, 6,000 years old.  I think it was less for this guy, wasn't it?  5,000, and there was dinosaurs and people riding dinosaurs.  And here's a guy that's pretty powerful in the government, and he truly believes that.  Who is he?  That was probably the most infuriating part of the movie.  I forgot, too.  His excuse was, hey, you don't have to have a high IQ to be a congressman.  And then he laughs, and Bill Maher's just looking at him like, oh, my God.  Dennis D on instant feedback, best part of religiousness, and he's got a link. 
[00:12:00]  I want to see what he thought was the best part of religiousness.  Well, if it's a listener, it can't be good.  That's true.  And then they go to the...  The credits.  Then they go to the creation...  The creationism museum.  And theme park.  And theme park.  This place...  You've got to put theme park on the end of that.  Oh, does it look like a hoot?  First, they have these animatronic dinosaurs.  One was a triceratops with a saddle on it.  Yeah.  Well, that's...  When you walk into this place, that's what you see.  Yeah, that's the wow factor.  The whole movie's coming back to me now. 
[00:12:30]  I like this.  And you walk in and they show, like, people, animatronic people with animatronic dinosaurs  because they lived together.  Sure.  Even though science has completely disproven this in every way, shape, or form, they just  say, well, it's our faith.  And they don't talk about them in the Bible at all, right?  You don't hear a lot of dinosaurs talking in the Bible.  No, but I'm sure they could twist something in the Bible around to mean dinosaur.  Yeah, they said beast in that one line.  Right, and that means dinosaur.  Well, yeah.  They never mentioned dinosaurs when I was a kid in CCD, and it never was... 
[00:13:00]  Oh, of course not.  It's a new thing because science afterwards has proven that they were around a lot earlier  than man, so then religion had to come up with an answer.  Right.  So now it's a modern kind of a thing.  Another great part was Bill Maher talking about, talking to that Jesus, guy that does  the Jesus reenactments.  Yeah.  And has to die every day for everybody.  Yeah, and this theme park, there's people sitting around as this Jesus guy is getting  the shit beat out of him and bleeding down the street.  It would be like if you were at Disney, and they have like, you know, one of the Mickey 
[00:13:30]  parades throughout the day.  Right.  And all of a sudden you hear...  And you look down and you go, oh, look, there's a parade.  Let's stand by Main Street.  Sure.  Watch Mickey.  Sure.  Oh, look, it's fucking Woody from Toy Story.  Of course.  Sleeping Beauty.  Yeah, yeah.  All of them are waving on floats.  Well, this, they're sitting around, and down like one of these little streets in this theme  park, this creationism theme park, is this guy dressed like Jesus, with the fucking cross  beam tied on his back, with Roman soldiers beating him. 
[00:14:00]  He's bleeding profusely.  Now there's women and men on the sides watching this parade, crying, praying, looking up, going,  Jesus, Jesus.  Like insane people.  And this is someone's Easter break.  Yeah, this is like, fuck Disney, fuck Universal.  We're going to the creationism park.  All you parents out there getting ready for your Disney trips, well, some people get ready  for this.  They were horrifying the people.  And they have Mary crying every day.  Mary's crying. 
[00:14:30]  Jesus is dying.  They put him up on the cross.  Yeah.  They put him up on the cross.  And as they're lifting him, you hear him going, ah, ah.  And they lift it up, and there's women fucking tears coming out of their eyes.  He's a terrific actor, too.  He really plays that Jesus well.  He loves playing Jesus.  And then he's like, all actor-ish.  Yeah, yeah.  When Bill Maher's talking to him.  I love the pre-roll they get, like, before they use the shit, because he's kind of like,  is my mic on?  Is my mic working?  Do you need any lighting?  Where should I stand?  Here?  Yeah.  And it's like, Jesus.  Yeah, stand by the big rolling rock that was in front of your tomb. 
[00:15:00]  Right.  Because we really need that shot.  Some dude on Instant Feedback.  It's a Jesus snuff show five times a day.  Pretty much, man.  Yeah, I like this movie a lot.  Yeah, it was good.  I saw the clip the guy liked from Religious.  It's when he was talking to the Jew.  Oh, the Jewish guy.  Yeah, he was out of hand.  Weren't they explaining the electric thing?  The electricity thing?  Yeah, electricity and how you're not supposed to use it on the Sabbath, so they have all  these ways of getting around it.  But, see, I think that goes against this God thing. 
[00:15:30]  That's what Bill Maher was saying, too.  Yeah, I don't think you're supposed to get around anything.  It's not like, there's no loopholes.  If you're not supposed to use electricity, you can't set a machine the day before the  Sabbath to take care of all your electricity needs the next day.  They're basically saying, don't use electric.  Yeah, yeah.  And David from Israel explained that, too.  They're all on timers.  They got people that aren't jizzed that come over and turn on and off your lights for you.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  They just do that for you.  And then there's elevators in predominantly Jewish businesses will stop on every floor 
[00:16:00]  during the Sabbath.  So you don't have to press buttons because you're not allowed to press buttons.  So you're technically figuring out a workaround.  You're not pressing a button.  But they are using the electricity.  Well, it's not them.  If they use the steps.  That's what we're saying.  You can't do a workaround like that.  Yeah.  Yeah, I like the movie a lot.  Yeah, it was definitely good. 
[00:16:30]  It was well done.  I like that he went after most of the main religions and certainly didn't back down when  it came to the Muslims, which a lot of people say, you know, people just stay away from  that religion altogether.  Yeah.  So you got to have a little respect for him for that.  But it's still Bill Maher.  No, I do like the fact that he was getting into that whole thing and getting into the  what the Danish cartoon fucking artist that got himself fucking massacred because of a  stupid cartoon.  And they said like over 100 people were killed by Muslims over that stupid fucking cartoon. 
[00:17:00]  What about what about speaking of the Muslims?  Wasn't there a wasn't there a group of gay Muslims or something in this movie?  There were two.  Two.  Okay.  There were two gay Muslims that were in a Muslim bar that was gay on one day a week.  So Bill Maher goes in to interview him and it's two guys in there.  He goes, so how many gay Muslims are there?  And they don't answer. 
[00:17:30]  And Bill Maher just was like, well, I guess it's you two.  And they're just sitting at this bar.  Are they waiting for more people to show up?  I don't know.  None were showing up.  I remember that too.  Yeah.  And what was the other thing?  There's one more fucking thing.  Oh, well, we brushed by it.  But the Mormon religion where.  Oh, yeah.  Where the Joe guy.  Where they.  What's his name?  The little 14 year old kid.  Yeah.  And he was the guy that got the story that Jesus came to America.  And the Garden of Eden's in Missouri. 
[00:18:00]  I guess he said Joseph Smith.  Joseph Smith.  Yeah.  And the cartoon where when you go to heaven, it's going to be God.  Who else?  It's three people.  God.  Fuck.  I forgot.  Joseph Smith.  No, that's that's that's that's that's the punch line.  And then you got Joe Smith looking like a normal human with regular clothes on.  When you got God with the robes and there was God, Jesus.  Was it that Jesus there?  I think Jesus.  All right.  Yeah.  Brigham Young.  You got the two holy guys and then you got Joe in a leisure suit. 
[00:18:30]  And Joe is there at the at the gates waiting for you.  Joe, who don't don't fuck around with that, man.  There's a lot of Mormons out there.  I know.  I know.  I did like the way Bill Maher, too, pointed out that every time there is a man and God  interaction, the man is completely alone and has to then go down and tell people what  he saw without any proof whatsoever.  Right.  It's like, it's like, can he just come down and tell a whole shitload of people?  It's like the UFO sightings, you know, and abductions. 
[00:19:00]  It's always one guy.  I think I'm going to go hike in the Appalachian.  Yeah.  And then come down and come down with some stuff.  See what it says.  See what he says.  Come down with like a couple week beard.  White hair.  Just stark white hair.  Dye the hair white a little bit.  I've seen the face of God.  Lord God almighty.  And then carry some shit down with you.  Yeah.  God gave me this.  God gave me this.  Check it out.  I don't know what it means, but you guys check it out.  Another great part was you get a lot of religious zealots that stand out in front of various 
[00:19:30]  places and preach their religion, whether it's Catholicism, Judaism, the whole gamut.  And they stand there and no one really looks at them weird or anything.  They just kind of look and go, oh, this guy's going out, going off.  Bill Maher dressed up and started preaching Scientology and what Scientology is about.  Right.  And it's hilarious because it's just spacemen from billions of years ago set off an atom bomb on our planet.  And he's saying this and people are looking at it and I'm like, what the fuck is this guy preaching? 
[00:20:00]  Not even knowing that this is legitimately Scientology.  Right, right.  And the idea of Scientology is insane.  But then the idea that your religion is better, but you got invisible people and talking snakes and ribs coming out of one.  It just people.  It's so funny.  We got instant feedback, obviously.  And God, a bunch of people just mad.  Why?  Because we're talking religion again.  Look, it's Bill Maher's take on the whole thing.  And it was very interesting. 
[00:20:30]  It's a good documentary and you can watch it and decide for yourself if it's full of shit or whatever.  Watch it yourself.  I just liked that he went after all the religions and kind of picked them apart a little bit.  Yeah, that was good.  And then I watched another documentary, too.  It was a short one.  Are you done with Religious?  Yeah, for the most part.  I suggest people just watch it.  What was the part near the end where the world's going to end in this one spot?  Yeah, yeah.  There's this one spot.  It was like a pile of rocks or something. 
[00:21:00]  And he was standing on top and that's the place Jesus is going to come down and the shit's going to hit the fan.  Right there.  Right there.  Right there.  It was where he was going to land, I guess.  You know, come down from the heavens.  And the shit's going to hit the fan.  And then he was showing a bunch of like fucking suicide bombings and killings in the name of religion and all that shit.  So, yeah, it's pretty intense.  It's pretty good.  Funny and informative and thought-provoking.  Look at me.  I think we had the guy in for a religious when we were working on the other joint.  Yep.  But Bill Maher refused to do our show. 
[00:21:30]  Well, good.  Of course.  I wouldn't want him on anyway.  I'm not that fucking hip on him.  I think this movie was well done.  No, but it would have been.  I mean, I don't think he's a complete fucking asshole.  Yeah, but we've had people on that we hate and are assholes.  So, the conflict would have been great.  That's true.  That would have been a perfect project to interview him about, but whatever.  I watched White Horse.  How's that?  White Horse is a movie.  I really didn't get the point of this fucking thing.  It's this Russian guy who lived in that town right near Chernobyl. 
[00:22:00]  Okay.  Like three kilometers away.  You could see the place.  It's that big apartment complex.  Which is just under two miles, right?  Yeah.  1.8-ish.  Kilometers.  1.83, I believe.  Yeah, something like that.  And it was-  For a reference point.  Yes, of course, for all of our international friends.  And he went back.  It was the story of him going back to his apartment and place that he lived with his parents.  And they had to leave 20-25 years ago, is it?  Something like that.  It was 1986.  Yeah, that's 25.  So, yeah, 25 years ago. 
[00:22:30]  But I think at this point it was 20 years ago.  So, this film was probably made five years ago.  And he was 10 at the time or something.  And he remembers very fondly playing and his mother and father in this apartment.  And he actually goes up into these huge buildings that are just- trees are growing in them.  Really?  They're fucking- that is abandoned, post-apocalyptic fucking apartment complex.  See, that shit's cool.  Was that at least cool?  It was creepy.  I love checking shit out like that.  It was filmed creepily and shit. 
[00:23:00]  And it was very dark, very rainy, very depressing looking.  Just to stop you for a second.  Yeah.  Have you ever, like, walked through the woods when you're growing up and you see there was  always one house?  A foundation?  Sometimes more than a foundation.  Yeah.  Where the trees are literally, like you just said, growing right through the top of the  roof and stuff.  It's creepy because you start thinking about-  I always found that shit so fascinating.  You think about the people that lived there.  Somebody- that was new at some point.  Right.  It was just built and somebody was happy to be moving in and living there. 
[00:23:30]  Right.  And now it's like, like, what happened?  I mean, the one I remember was in the woods, and I guess it was an old road.  Yeah.  Like, way back whenever.  And now that road has pretty much grown in as well.  So this house feels like it's just in the middle of nowhere, which it is now.  It's so odd.  But at the time, it certainly wasn't.  Yeah.  But anyway, go ahead.  I'm sorry.  No, it was a development right near Chernobyl, and this guy lived there when he was about  10 with his family and his friends, and there were stores and everything, and he was  pointing out what everything was.  This was where they sold toys, and he goes, that's my apartment building. 
[00:24:00]  And he's like, holy, every two seconds, he would just keep saying, like, holy fuck.  Motherfucker.  Motherfucker.  How long was this documentary?  It was very short.  I told you about this.  Yes.  This is where he goes back to Chernobyl?  Yes.  Okay.  Yeah, yeah.  I thought that's right.  It was very short.  Yeah.  But I've seen, like, three Chernobyl documentaries so far, so I'm not sure which one is which,  but I do remember that.  Yeah.  It was weird, because it was just like, it was him, he goes back to his apartment, he  looks at, like, some shit that was still around, like this rubber ball, and he's just  smoking cigarettes and depressed. 
[00:24:30]  And then they leave, and it's over.  And it's all the, and all his old stuff has just, has been there ever since, right?  Yeah, well, they had to leave everything there.  Right.  But everything's gone now.  There was, like, a rubber ball, but the white horse was...  Why is everything gone?  People were brave enough to go into that area and pick apart?  Yeah, soldiers and people that were in there just fucking took everything, but they were  told they were going to be back in three days, so they could leave everything.  Wow.  Whoopsie, yeah.  And then they just left, and you ain't coming back.  25 years later.  25 years later, and they set up, there's, like, fucking miles out, there's these guard 
[00:25:00]  posts that are still manned.  You know, it's really odd, the catastrophe.  And the white horse was this poster of a white horse in a stall sticking its head out  like Mr. Ed would, that double-doored stall, and he's sticking his head out the top stall.  And he's got this weird look on his face, the horse.  And he was talking about how his bed was right next to the white horse.  And you could tell, he wasn't even saying this, but you could tell that he remembered  so vividly laying down and looking at that fucking horse face and knowing every detail 
[00:25:30]  of it.  Because he looked at it for so long, and he's, like, touching it in weird spots.  He's, like, and he wouldn't say a word.  Like, it's a documentary where this guy didn't fucking talk.  He was just depressed.  And he's, like, looking at this thing, and you could tell, like, that was every night  for him was, like, having a fun little kid life, going to bed, and this white horse was,  like, looking over him.  It was probably everything before.  And it was still there on the wall, but it was peeled and, like, rotting and shit.  And that was the only part that was kind of like, wow, that's fucked up. 
[00:26:00]  Either that or he really enjoyed a certain video from Seattle, which was made a few years  ago, where a gentleman took his horse life too far.  He did it a little too far and got the same reaction as radiation, internal bleeding.  Shit.  So that was just, and it was very short.  Like, when they left, and then the credits start rolling, you're like, what the fuck  was that?  They probably realized they had a nobody and said, fuck, let's just wrap this shit up.  It's like, get somebody that's going to be a little more talkative. 
[00:26:30]  We'll make it into a short film.  Take it around.  I don't know what, and I wonder how the radiation is there still, and, you know, because it was  close.  They went out on their balcony, and they looked over, and there was fucking Chernobyl just  sitting there.  The tower and everything.  Didn't they say the radiation levels are non-existent now over there?  Really?  I don't know.  I have no idea.  I know they packed that core in, like, concrete and lead and shit.  Right, right, right.  It might be, but I'm sure the groundwater isn't right and shit like that, probably underneath.  Like, in Japan right now, wow, they're having a problem with that number two reactor. 
[00:27:00]  Yeah, that's going to be...  It could be a complete meltdown.  Oh, now a partial?  Cracked core, and water leaking out that's contaminated, and now they've got to dispose  of all the water they've been pumping in to cool it down.  They've got to get that out because it's putting up plumes of radioactive steam.  And where do you put that water?  Exactly.  And they're saying the seawater off the coast there, right there, is contaminated.  No, more than that.  They said they found it even more north than they first realized.  Yeah, yeah, the seawater is... 
[00:27:30]  Well, they were getting giant, like, million-time readings.  I had tuna yesterday.  Oh, was that good?  It was excellent, but I'm starting to...  I am so paranoid of fucking anything coming from the ocean.  Just in general, I'm starting to get really paranoid.  Yeah, I should avoid sushi, right?  Take glowing shits.  Who the fuck knows?  Your dumps are just in there like a green glow stick.  Especially sushi, because, you know, that's started in Japan.  I know they get the fish from all over the place. 
[00:28:00]  I think the fish is local.  But you've got to assume a lot of these restaurants go, no, I need my fish from Japan.  That's crazy.  That's like fucking flying it over.  I think we're okay.  If anything, the West Coast.  But I think East Coast, we're getting fucking, you know...  Yeah.  Where are we getting our fish?  We think we're all right.  Yeah.  We did.  Everyone was making a big to-do about the Gulf oil, too.  And, you know...  True.  I've had great shrimp since then.  Love them scramps.  I love scramps!  I didn't even know this, but I guess to make it official, my Islanders are out of the NHL playoffs officially. 
[00:28:30]  Oopsie!  They lost to Philly on Saturday, 4-1.  Wow.  I've been out for, I don't know, a long time.  Yeah.  Fucking long time.  I wouldn't have been surprised hearing anything but that.  Wow.  That they are, in fact, Dunsky.  Well, and I got a ticket rep.  He wanted me to go to the game Saturday.  I'm like, no, I'm not going.  Well, I want to meet you.  He's my new guy now. 
[00:29:00]  I'd rather get like a parking ticket or something.  Yeah, he's trying to...  Stealing Jim's bed.  That's a good one.  He's trying to...  That's a good one.  He's trying to get me to re-up next year.  The season's not even over.  This is how desperate the organization is.  And my old ticket rep called me and admitted that I got ripped off this year.  I thought you were going to say he hung himself.  Well, he told me that they fired a lot of guys right before they were going to make bonus to save that money.  That's nice.  That doesn't show a desperation in a company.  So the new guy calls me.  He's like, yeah, I want to talk about next year already. 
[00:29:30]  I'm like, what?  I bought a half a season, so it's 20-some-odd games.  I went to six fucking games.  I ate 14 games.  And my old ticket rep goes, you got ripped off.  They're selling your tickets right around your area.  Yeah, for like nothing.  For like 50 bucks a seat.  Great.  Safe to say I spent a lot more than that.  So I'm going to tell this guy why...  I'm not getting season tickets next year.  I'll just buy a few tickets in my area where I like to sit because they're going to be available.  Oh, there'll be plenty.  Thank you guys for ripping off the season ticket holders by having these deals right around where you sit. 
[00:30:00]  By the way, what this means, best Islander season ever.  Probably.  And Ovi will be completely shut out of Islander Stanley Cup tickets.  Probably.  I mean, the team actually, after they had that, what was it, 17-game losing streak,  they actually have played really, not really well, but very good hockey.  Good hockey?  Yeah.  I mean, if they didn't have that 17-game losing streak, they would have made the playoffs.  That'll hurt.  That's what it comes down to. 
[00:30:30]  I'm all about fucking UConn female basketball, though.  Female?  Oh, yeah.  What's that about?  I have no idea.  Ugh.  Watches that shit.  No, I just heard on the news before that UConn, of course, is their chick team,  which like wins everything, is poised to win again.  Yeah, but the men's team is in the Final Four.  Oh, I didn't even know that.  I was confused.  I'm like, what, the men's team are looking girly?  No, no, no, the girls team.  It's like, who cares?  Oh, the girls are playing the same time the men's are playing? 
[00:31:00]  I guess so.  That's dumb.  No one cares.  Let the men's tournament, I should say, finish up first.  Let the men's play.  And then let the broads play.  The broads.  I have nothing to do with college basketball.  Well, I mean, and it's gotten to the point, too, where some people that just tweet March  Madness stuff, I'm starting to temporarily not follow them.  One guy, though, he's a cool guy.  He was that guy that was in Friday. 
[00:31:30]  I can't not follow him, but he's a sports guy.  He likes his basketball.  Yeah.  So that, but other things where it's just like one after another of these names of schools.  I don't even know where they are and shit.  I'm just, I can't.  I don't know about that.  I can't do it.  You got Kentucky in the Final Four.  You got UConn in the Final Four.  Really?  That's two biggies.  And then you had VCU with the big upset, so they're in the Final Four, and you got Butler.  Here's Butler.  And you got Butler.  We're down to 14.  But he's my Butler.  It'll be over next Monday, so don't worry about it. 
[00:32:00]  You know what?  Here's how much I don't know about college basketball.  Up until five years ago, I seriously thought UConn was a team from way up north in Canada.  Wow.  I really did.  I don't even know if that's supposed to be a joke or not.  I never put together the University of Connecticut.  I didn't.  I thought it was Y-U-K-O-N.  UConn.  UConn.  I thought they were from the north, from the fucking north of everything, up in the UConn. 
[00:32:30]  That's sweet.  Yeah.  It's cute.  Well, what about the women's basketball?  Why'd you bring that up?  I just brought it up because...  Was there a thought there?  No, no.  I just think that this UConn women's team...  Yeah.  Because they had that huge streak, right?  That unbroken...  They got the record, like, for the most wins, right?  Mm-hmm.  And I just heard they were going to win.  Like, they're poised to win again.  And it's one of those things where it's like, this is three consecutive titles it would be.  Right.  And no one gives a shit.  Like, if this professional sporting team... 
[00:33:00]  What?  ...won the championship three times in a row...  Right.  ...there'd be Dynasty, Parade, you'd know every player's fucking name, you'd know everything.  These chicks are just like, who gives a shit?  Well, who goes to women's basketball?  Dykes.  And who else?  The gay?  No, not even the gay.  You think gay guys go?  I think just dykes.  The lesbos?  Yeah.  So there's not enough lesbos to keep the sport going?  Never enough lesbians to keep anything going, really.  Seriously, do, like, straight...  Who goes to, like, a women's basketball game? 
[00:33:30]  Who has, like, season tickets to the fucking game?  I know, like, the WNBA, that's all lesbians.  That's gone.  But, I mean, college...  I think the college people go.  I think the college kids go.  Yeah, it's well...  If you've got a good women's basketball team, I would assume...  Days out.  I would assume you would get some people from the straight community.  If you want to meet a fat chick with funny short hair...  If they're going to call it the gay community, we could call it the straight community, right?  Yes, in our straight community.  So it's probably a bit of the straight community in a lot of the lesbos.  Did you even know the WNBA was still good? 
[00:34:00]  I thought they disbanded.  I thought they were gone like that.  Until that controversy where that girl tweeted something shitty about Japan, I didn't even know that they were still in existence.  Yeah, I think they're sort of in trouble.  I think so.  Yeah, who's footing the bill for that?  Nobody wants to see that shit.  No one.  I agree wholeheartedly.  I think they're in trouble.  I'm still annoyed about that Islander sing.  I'm still annoyed.  Which one?  Just that they fucking do that to season ticket holders.  It's another fucking piece of shit sports organization.  This guy wants to talk to me so bad.  I'm like, no. 
[00:34:30]  No.  I'm not buying season tickets next year.  The team will be pretty good next year.  I know I say that every year, but I did follow them enough to know that they're on the right path.  But they've got to get rid of the DPH.  Maybe I should go to a sports talk channel to talk this shit.  Sports talk?  Because I'm getting a little too deep.  Although you won't get much hockey out of Mad Dog either.  Not a lot, but they're going to be way down on season ticket holders next year.  So I'll just pick my games.  I'll find an area I want to sit.  Maybe I'll move it around a little bit and I'll go to five or six games next year and save a shitload of money. 
[00:35:00]  My tickets are over 10 G's, man.  Jesus.  I threw like 10 G's away this year.  Easy.  They're just crazy.  They're such scumbags, these teams.  All of them.  They have no loyalty at all to fans.  None.  No one made me more pissed off was that they raised the parking fee.  Of course they did.  Without even fucking paving the damn thing.  I was going to say, yeah.  At least paved the parking lot.  Extra holes.  Look, you know, in the off season we kind of cleaned up the parking lot a little bit, so we're raising your parking fee. 
[00:35:30]  No, it was the exact same shitty parking lot.  Yeah, look at this great lot.  Where there's glass from people that are, you know, having some road sodas before the game.  Yeah.  Road sodas.  Oh, man, are they killing me on Twitter with that road sod thing.  Rightly so.  Well, it's wrong grabbing some road sodas with your boys before you head out.  So then you find them parking, and there's broken glass, there's weeds.  It's like Chernobyl, Ant, the parking lot out there at NASA Coliseum.  It really does look like there's been a nuclear disaster at NASA Coliseum. 
[00:36:00]  It's embarrassing.  It's like, at the very least, if you're going to raise, like, the fee, then make it look like you did something.  Paint fucking lines, at least so I know where to park.  Would you guys ever say road sodas more than you should have because...  Oh, we thought the adults didn't understand, so you'd probably use the term more than you had to.  Okay, where's the road sodas?  Oh, the road sodas?  I'll go get them.  Yeah, probably.  Well, I...  Do you want yours warmed or douche chilled?  It was more...  I don't think we were getting away with something with the adults. 
[00:36:30]  I think it was more like we thought we were just so fucking cool that we had some kind of lingo going.  You know what I mean?  I know that age.  You really just think you're the coolest fucking kid alive, man.  You look back and cringe at your douchiness.  Absolutely.  I know.  Old people.  Yeah?  Women's basketball.  Oh, old people go?  Yes, Matt in Connecticut, thank you.  Yeah, that makes sense.  Road sodas. 
[00:37:00]  What are you going to do?  What are you going to do?  I had a few road sodas Friday night.  Did you?  Yeah.  I was putting them back Friday night, and then I think I stayed up until 10 a.m. Saturday morning from Friday night.  Wow.  I don't know how you do that.  And then I slept, and slept Saturday completely away.  And then I got up like Sunday, and I was sleeping then.  Everything's a bar.  You weren't up late Saturday night?  No, I was on the couch. 
[00:37:30]  But no, I did wake up at some point Saturday, what would be considered Saturday night slash Sunday morning.  And I was up at like 3 in the morning going, all right, now I'll turn on some TV.  I think I'm up for the, and then back asleep.  But I needed, and then everything came around and worked out for Sunday, where I was tired relatively early, went to sleep, woke up.  I'm like, cool.  Fucking worked out.  I'm all fucking back in work mode.  One of the things I miss as a father is those Sunday, lazy Sundays, which you basically just described, where you're in and out of sleep the entire day. 
[00:38:00]  And you're on a couch.  I was on a couch.  And you watch a little bit, a half hour, and then you're sleeping, and you can kind of hear the TV.  It's just like, it's just a very, it's such a cool feeling.  And it's a deep, it's a deep nap that you're just doing all day long.  You don't care what's on TV.  Like, I woke up at one point that the newer Star Trek that they made was on, and I didn't care.  I wasn't even looking for the remote.  But I'm just like, yeah, I'm going to watch it.  And then you just drift back off to sleep. 
[00:38:30]  I drifted back off to sleep.  I lived long and prospered.  Turned 80 over the weekend.  Yeah, he did.  The Nimoy.  Leonard Nimoy.  Our fucking mayor is so embarrassing.  Is that him?  Yeah.  Yeah.  It's the inner circle thing that all the mayors do every year.  He looks perfectly at home.  With what?  Being a fucking flirty little fruity twit.  He really does.  Yeah, that was, he looked like a gay sugar daddy there.  I don't know what he was playing, but he certainly looked like a gay sugar daddy. 
[00:39:00]  This mayor thing is the costume.  To me, that seems real.  That's the way he really is.  That's the real mayor.  They basically do SNL skits.  And he was making fun of Spider-Man, and he came onto stage with wires and just, like,  got stuck.  And got stuck because that's what's going on.  That's what is happening with the Broadway musicals.  But they put him in all kinds of weird costumes and then let him go around like a lunatic.  But when he was dancing and doing that whole thing, oh, he wants that.  That's his dream, is to be that.  You know what he should have done?  He should have went into the aisles and put giant fucking, giant cement potted plants so 
[00:39:30]  no one could use the aisles.  And they had to walk all the way around, and everybody had to be filtered down one aisle.  That's what he should have done, that jizz bag.  That wouldn't make a bottleneck, would it?  Can we go back to women's sports?  We just were.  Yeah, true.  We're continuing.  You're right.  There's one women's sport we forgot about.  What?  Well, let this guy on really fast.  Fist catching? 
[00:40:00]  Let's say hi to Jeremy in Ohio.  Jeremy.  Hey, what's up, boys?  Hey, mate.  They just tried a lingerie football team here yesterday.  They're called the Cleveland Crush.  The fucking lingerie football is, that...  That ain't no sport.  That is way better than that arena football.  I don't know if arena football is around anymore.  They do hit each other.  But they basically, it's basically arena football with girls in lingerie.  Yeah.  And they take it really seriously.  Look at that.  Look at these fucking broads.  And some cities are banning this shit. 
[00:40:30]  Why?  Why?  The women take it very seriously.  They're not just little, they look...  They hit each other fucking hard, man.  They look great, but what makes this so cool to watch is, like you said, they take it seriously  and they're hitting each other really hard.  They have great legs, these chicks.  Oh, yeah, man.  Hey, Jimmy.  Yes, sir?  When are you going to come back to Cleveland on tour?  I'm not sure.  I have other dates to announce today, though.  Yeah, he'll figure that shit out for you there, Jeremy.  Thank you.  Yeah, but there you go.  Lingerie football. 
[00:41:00]  Look at the line.  Look at the center.  Oh, that lucky center.  Look at that.  The center's a little beefy.  Yeah, the center's got to be beefy.  She's a little beefy, but the quarterback is nimble.  Look at the quarterback's body like a fucking...  Look at the curves on the quarterback.  Holy shit.  Oh, I would fuck that quarterback right in the ass.  But they...  Now they're going to isolate that, and when we're talking about the Patriots, they'll pop  that in.  They take it really...  Have you seen the highlights of this yet, Jimmy?  No.  Oh, there's a highlight reel that is just the best. 
[00:41:30]  The best.  Mm-mm.  It's like a three-minute promotional sizzle reel.  A sizzle reel, and boy, does it sizzle.  To get you interested in lingerie football.  Yeah, and it's not that horse shit they do at halftime at the Super Bowl.  This is...  No, no.  This is a real deal.  They're into it.  They want to beat the fuck out of each other.  And the fans are kind of into it in a weird way.  Like, I'm not...  I shouldn't say it like that.  They're obviously enjoying what they're seeing.  Yeah.  Because they're really hot, but they're also into their team winning. 
[00:42:00]  It's a perfect combination.  Wonderfulness.  Hell yeah.  I want to see that.  I want to see that, yo.  What else?  We sort of did the Final Four.  Oh, I got my Tiger Woods.  Oh, what?  The only video game I play.  Oh, the Tiger Woods golf?  I think it finally comes out this week or next week.  Now, what...  I've only played for about an hour or so, but so far, so good.  I like it.  Yeah?  What's different about it? 
[00:42:30]  Anything?  Did they make the graphics look a little better?  A little bit.  Yeah.  They're so behind in the graphics for some reason.  That shit should look like a movie.  It really should, right?  Yeah.  Like, I always thought Hot Shots had better graphics.  You know what it is, too?  It's not even like a first-person shooter where the graphics are constantly moving around,  you know?  It's not that quick and everything.  They ought to just put out something where it looks great, you know?  Make it look like a fucking movie.  Yeah, I just feel like every time I buy Tiger Woods that the graphics are way behind other 
[00:43:00]  video games.  The gameplay is really, really good.  It's very accurate.  If you like playing the actual game...  Yeah, that they've gotten down.  They've figured out a way to make you play fucking golf on a computer where you really  need to finesse some of this stuff.  It's too early to give it a review, but so far, so good.  If we're going to talk video games real quick, I got a copy of MLB 2K11.  Yeah?  And can I just tell Take-Two Interactive, just give the fucking license up, please? 
[00:43:30]  Can you just give it back to EA so everybody can get along again?  EA Sports is the only one that makes good sporting games.  Look, 2K, it's not a terrible game.  But the problem is that the license can only go to one company.  So, 2K has the license for Xbox.  Sony has it for PlayStation.  And Sony will not release there.  If you want to play Sony's game, you've got to get on PlayStation.  By the way, Sony is notoriously shit at releasing, at playing with other people. 
[00:44:00]  They're fucking horrendous.  That's why their MP3 player is horrible, and they didn't do the iPod.  Yeah.  Because they stink.  They're all proprietary stuff.  They love their proprietary stuff.  I hate Sony.  That's why the PSP is...  I mean, I wouldn't call it a failure, but it's not exactly what they want it to be.  It's not the Xbox.  It's not a Game Boy.  You know, Game Boys are everywhere.  Because, once again, they had that proprietary UMD cartridge, which no one fucking wants.  But anyway, the game, it's 2011.  We have these amazing games.  I don't need to see angled, jagged shadows on someone's face. 
[00:44:30]  There should never be fucking pixelated edges on anything.  This game could be the funnest baseball game you've ever played.  If I start seeing angled, square, pixely shadow faces...  I like good graphics.  It's about time.  We could do this better.  That's the alias thing.  Well, like the baseball and the golf, I mean, the games are relatively simple, obviously.  So the graphics would really...  So you think they could really step up the graphics.  The graphics would be just so cool to check out. 
[00:45:00]  No, I was just going to say, not only just graphics, but gameplay itself.  It's like, you know, when I swing the bat...  Well, my, you know, your virtual bat.  The gameplay shouldn't freeze up for like a half a second.  You know, I guess the CPU is deciding what kind of hit I just had or whatever.  But like, you'll smack the ball and it hangs.  That should be instant.  For like a half a second.  Again, takes you out of it.  Yeah, you just got to give up on it.  It got to the point where it was like, who was playing this and decided that... 
[00:45:30]  Like, okay, it's time to go gold.  It's ready.  Can't you go back to...  Which one do you have?  Well, I have the 2K11, which is the one I'm complaining about.  I could get the show, which is for PlayStation.  Which one has got the license?  Sony?  Sony has a license for PlayStation.  And 2K has for Xbox.  Is PlayStation better?  What's EA?  They got nothing right now.  No, but what is it?  Electronic Arts.  They basically have every...  They do sports. 
[00:46:00]  It's EA.  EA does everything sports.  EA Sports.  Yeah, yeah.  They do a good job.  They do Madden.  They do the NHL.  What's the most realistic looking sports game as far as...  Like, it just looks...  I saw a baseball commercial.  Madden.  Madden football.  Any of those Madden football games.  The number they get, it gets crazy.  Madden's ridiculous.  When it's up on the big screen and you look at it...  It's ridiculous.  You think there's a game on.  You know which one is real?  The fucking UFC one.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Dude, I've been online and I'm looking up fights and I'll see one that I hadn't seen and 
[00:46:30]  I fucking click on it and it's that cocksucker game.  Like a match that I never thought happened anyway.  Like, look at this football fucking game.  Yeah, Madden's.  It's hysterical.  Look at that.  See, that's how the golf should look at this point.  It looks great.  How come there's this shadowing?  There's no names under the real people, though.  There's no circles.  Well, you have to know.  It's amazing.  And then they fucking smack talk and do their little victory dances and...  Look at the graphics.  That's amazing.  There's a beat your girlfriend segment. 
[00:47:00]  The Tiger Woods golf doesn't look anything near this.  Not even close.  And I'll tell you something.  You know what I've never heard on EA and I've played Madden games?  I've never heard the audio go out of situation or whatever have you.  And this 2K11, all the fucking time, I mean, multiple times during a game, the announcers  are saying shit that has nothing to do with going on.  Nothing to do.  I hate that.  Takes it right out of it.  What I hate about last year's Tiger Woods, the commentators...  The commentators?  Yeah.  It's like, why are you lazy? 
[00:47:30]  Like, you know, people are going to be playing this game for hundreds of hours.  So, fucking sit these assholes in a studio a little longer.  For hours.  It feels like it's ten things they say.  It's like, really?  You paid these guys?  How hard is it to give them thousands of things to say?  This putt could be difficult.  Right.  Exactly.  That's infuriating.  But what about when they start recycling the shit that they did last year?  Like this game, 2K11.  I don't have 2K10.  I don't have it.  But I was reading some reviews and they rehashed a lot of the fucking audio from last year. 
[00:48:00]  They sort of did that with Tiger Woods.  Last year was the same as the year before with the common...  Do they have any Creasy Tiger Woods?  Is there any that...  Yeah, there's a demo up there.  But with the Tiger Woods game, obviously, what should be mentioned, they have Augusta for the first time.  Where they played the Masters.  You finally got the Augusta course.  Why didn't they have that before?  I don't know.  Were they not allowed to?  Probably not paid for the licensing.  Oh, I'm sure they weren't allowed to.  They had to pay for the licensing.  Because they would have certainly put that up years ago.  And the other thing that is very noticeable, Tiger Woods is this big. 
[00:48:30]  I'm holding up my...  That's about a quarter inch.  Yeah.  My thumb and my index finger.  Yeah.  That's how big...  No, that's how big he is on the game cover.  Oh, on the box?  Really?  That's what they think of Tiger Woods these days.  Wow, really?  Like he's way down the fairway.  In past years, obviously, he's front and center.  Right.  But they are fading that motherfucker out.  They're fading him out like his game is fading away.  Because he...  He's really sucking, right?  He hasn't won a tournament at this point. 
[00:49:00]  Let me think.  The incident was a year and a half ago.  Believe it or not.  Are you shitting me that long already?  Well, it was a year ago, Thanksgiving.  November 2009?  Yeah.  So almost a year and a half ago.  And he didn't win a tournament for a few months before the incident.  Wow.  So he hasn't won a tournament in at least a year and a half.  Textures are horrible in this game.  Yeah.  They're horrible.  What do you mean, textures?  Everything's very flat.  You don't get that nice texture-y like a building should look like it's got dimension to it and some bricks to it. 
[00:49:30]  Like the sides are just flat.  The grass is even...  Yeah, we're looking at the demo for Tiger Woods, obviously.  The shadows aren't good.  This is not that bad, though.  No, well, in this day and age, if it was any worse, no one would buy it.  Oh.  That's 2010.  Yeah, that was 10.  Where's the 11, Danny?  It's still...  It's all about lighting, dynamic lighting, textures, fucking...  It should look like when light hits something a certain way, it should shadow on it based on its material. 
[00:50:00]  Where do you think video games will be in five years, the way that they're getting better every year?  I've seen a few games that look really good.  See what they're doing here?  Homefront looks great.  Got great graphics on that one.  They're showing just basic...  They're showing real footage.  No, why?  Yeah, yeah.  Because they don't feel good enough about their graphics.  Oh, they're going to fade into the graphics, but watch.  This is to pump it up.  It should be in fucking game, constantly.  Oh, it is EA, right?  Yeah, yeah. 
[00:50:30]  Tiger Woods is EA.  I don't know why they have...  Maybe because the guys that play golf aren't as young or demanding as the ones who play football and stuff.  Yeah.  That's probably pretty accurate.  But look at that.  What do you think, Ian?  I mean, it's functional.  Oh, it's certainly functional.  It keeps my interest, but I get frustrated.  Do you play it on your TV?  Because I buy the game.  Yeah.  I buy the game every year.  To be fair, this is a shitty YouTube video also.  So it's compressed.  Yeah, but I'm looking at the water. 
[00:51:00]  The sand traps stink.  Those are awful.  They could have done better.  See, that's what it looks like.  Like, look at him.  His skin, you don't see, like, any texture to his...  No, no.  He's very stiff.  He's still very cartoony.  You know what I mean?  Yeah, yeah.  We're way past cartoony on our video games.  Way past that shit.  But the gameplay itself, you know, it's accurate.  Nice straight shot.  But look at that.  We got a lot of that one.  Are there really streams along golf courses?  Yes.  Oh, they suck. 
[00:51:30]  Yes.  That's where your ball goes every time, by the way.  Do you take a birdie out of the fairway?  Take a birdie out of the fairway.  I would love to take a birdie for the fairway every time.  I would take a birdie.  Take a birdie.  Yes, I would do that.  Jimmy's so funny with his sports talk when he doesn't know.  I have no idea what...  I mean, I know what the goal is, but I love golf.  I wish I did.  I hate it.  I just can't get out there anymore.  Is it going to stick?  Oh, a little backspin.  See, that can look way better. 
[00:52:00]  People who play it, like all athletes who play it, love it.  Guys that retire, like football players and baseball players, they all fall in love with it.  I don't know, though.  I was just hoping for a major jump up in graphics.  I like good graphics.  It's functional, like you said, certainly.  And I will play this game hundreds of hours in the next six months, no problem.  Do you have a portable version of it, too?  No, no.  Didn't you have a PS...  I liked my PSP.  The PSP was happening for a while, and then they just didn't improve any of their shit 
[00:52:30]  and just basically let it die.  It's done?  It's not done, but...  They have a new model.  Because like I was saying before, the whole UMD failure.  Yeah.  No one wanted to buy those shitty fucking things.  So now there's a new one, a new PSP, that doesn't use any kind of physical media, and it's all  based on downloading shit directly.  Oh, yeah.  Right.  Which is the future.  Maybe they'll have a comeback then.  Future of everything.  I liked my PSP when I was traveling, certainly.  Do you have a floppy disk in your computer? 
[00:53:00]  Yeah.  Do you remember how a floppy disk would be fucking...  Floppy.  Floppy.  But it's like, that's how it's going to be now with this type of stuff.  It's all going to be just fucking downloading.  I remember the big floppies.  Remember those fucking five...  What are they?  Five inch?  Five and a quarter.  Five and a quarter floppy.  Five and a half.  And you put those things in and just hear...  On the reader.  How big would they be?  And then you got the little floppy and you're like, ooh.  They're like big square fucking...  How much information though?  Oh, shit.  It was nothing.  I think it was like 768K.  It was nothing.  These giant disks of like fucking regular tape recorder material. 
[00:53:30]  Sucked.  Let me say hi to Joe in Oceanside.  Joe?  They always get corrupted.  What's up, boys?  Hey.  Listen, NHL 2011 on PlayStation, you can actually like pick your name out of a list and the  announcers will say your name.  Like if you make your own player, it will say your name on the announcement.  Like it'll integrate your name into it.  That's kind of cool.  And also you can upload your own music like off your iPod or iTunes and the background music 
[00:54:00]  will play your iPod.  Holy shit.  You can only do that for like the last eight years.  That's not new.  I'm a huge hockey fan.  I can't fucking play the hockey game, Joe.  My fucking brain like just explodes.  I can't figure out all the shit you have to do.  You got to work fast.  I don't even like hockey that much and the game is just amazing.  The graphics on the hockey game, because I played it for about a week and then my brain 
[00:54:30]  literally exploded.  Yeah.  It short circuited.  And I threw the I literally threw the controller and said, that's it.  I can't fucking I don't have the skills to play this stupid fucking game.  You don't want to put yourself on the hockey team.  Hockey.  How horrible.  Hey, look, it's me.  And then they're doing something where you have to like, you have to fucking make your  own team and you got to get guys and this.  I don't have time.  I just want to play the fucking game.  Yeah.  Oh, I got to make it so complicated.  I got a question.  That new Tiger Woods game, they really like made Tiger Woods name really, really small 
[00:55:00]  in it, right?  It's kind of not Tiger Woods golf.  Well, that's what I said on the cover.  On the cover, he's tiny, like he's way down the fairway.  But they're basically saying, look, it might be time to fade him out.  Maybe maybe this is the last year of his deal with them.  But who else?  I don't know.  Who are they going to put there?  There's a million young gunners.  Who, though, that has his name power?  We're waiting for someone to step out in front.  But you got a lot of real good young players right now. 
[00:55:30]  Maybe Bubba Watson.  Maybe he'll be the face of the EA golf game.  I don't know.  Too early to tell.  But the one thing is Tiger is pretty much done.  Someone tweeted over the weekend, you think Tiger will never win another tournament again.  You know what?  He'll probably squeeze out a couple more.  He probably will.  But he's not going to be dominant anymore.  It's not Tiger Woods.  He came in 20-something place over the weekend.  And then the week before, or two weeks ago, same thing. 
[00:56:00]  He came in 20-something place.  Yeah.  At the Blue Monster, at Doral.  A course he used to fucking just own.  Not doing well.  He is done.  I wonder if it was steroids or something.  Because there were rumors about the steroids.  Maybe he had to fucking clean his shit up.  Were they testing back then, though?  I don't know.  I don't know.  I'm not going to just throw something out there.  I don't think so.  I don't think like all the sports they were, anyway.  What did you put on a fucking floppy that was, how big are the size?  Five and a half floppies ranged from 180k per side to 1.2 megs. 
[00:56:30]  Per side?  Per side.  That's a lot.  I remember getting a fucking iOmega jazz drive, and I was like, I am styling, styling, motherfucker.  I was storing.  What could you put on one of those?  I mean, like a lot of documents?  It was, yeah, yeah.  You weren't really putting a lot of...  Word didn't exist then, did it?  You weren't putting a lot of pictures on it. 
[00:57:00]  I mean, but I mean, what was a Word document at that time?  I mean, it was...  Even Word docs now are still nothing.  How much are they at?  It depends how long, but I mean, let's...  Even a 250k Word document is gigantic.  Yeah.  That would be like, I don't know, 100 pages.  But you weren't putting pictures on those fucking discs or anything.  Could you put a music video on that?  I don't think you'd get very far into video.  HD video.  You could probably get half a second.  HD video.  That's it, right?  Let's go to Craig in Oregon.  He wants to...  Can't even get a screen cap. 
[00:57:30]  This guy wants to defend Tiger.  Oh!  He's a billionaire, by the way, so don't worry about him.  Yeah, he'll be okay.  He'll be okay.  I don't want to defend him, though.  I don't want to defend him, because I really don't...  I don't watch golf, but I mean, the people who say that he'll never win again...  I mean, that's...  It's just got to be the stupidest thing anyone can do.  Oh, wow.  First of all, it's not stupid.  He will win again, but he's not going to be dominant ever again, and he's going to win  a few tournaments here and there.  He's done.  Tiger Woods is done.  And I was one of these guys...  I'll admit, every time I watch golf, I want to see Tiger win. 
[00:58:00]  I was one of those guys.  It's so obvious that he's done, bro.  Well, he just lost, what?  Half a billion dollars?  I mean, give the guy a couple years to recoup.  You think he's upset?  What is he recouping from?  All the pussy he used to get on the road?  And new pussy.  He's getting all that now.  Now he's getting new pussy.  You do realize he hasn't won a golf tournament.  Maybe Danny can look it up.  It's at least a year and a half.  He hasn't even won one fucking tournament. 
[00:58:30]  I haven't heard of him winning.  You know, I know he apparently was having a good start this last...  I don't know if it was a Masters he was playing in or what, but anyway...  Masters?  Masters was almost a year ago.  What are you talking about?  Where's this guy going?  The Masters is a couple weeks away.  Where are you going?  What?  There was a tournament a week ago, a couple weeks ago, he was having a good start.  He had one good round.  Two weeks ago, I think he came in 29th place, and over the weekend he came in about the same area.  And I get that, man, but to say that he's just never going to be on top again, I just think that's a little too early. 
[00:59:00]  He will never dominate the PGA again, mark my words.  Because now all the young guys have caught up.  I don't think you're going to get a dominant player in general in the next five or six years.  Is he going to be...  I think you're going to have guys just, this guy wins this week, this guy wins this week.  They're going to move it around a little bit for the next few.  Will he break Nicholas' record or no?  He was on target. 
[00:59:30]  I forget how close he is at this point, but he's in trouble as far as Jack's records go at this point.  Last win was November 09.  Okay, so it was a couple weeks before Thanksgiving.  November 09.  So what?  Would April 9th be a year and a half, I guess, right?  Nine.  Oh, no.  Eleven, yeah.  May, I guess, would be, right?  Yeah, May would be.  May 9th would be a year and a half without a win for Tiger Woods.  That's crazy.  It's a long time.  He was guaranteed to win, I don't know, at least five or six a year. 
[01:00:00]  Yeah.  Minimum.  Five or six tournaments a year minimum.  Poor guy.  In his prime.  With his new 22-year-old pussy and his fucking billions of dollars.  Is that how old this chick is?  Billions of dollars.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  622?  Yeah.  Yeah, she's hot.  Another blonde.  She used to...  No, what are you saying?  Go ahead.  No, that he knows her because she was, like, a neighbor.  Yeah, so...  Yeah, so...  What?  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  It's a pretty sweet story.  So, like, she used to, like, draw pictures for him, like, good luck pictures, like, before  a fucking tournament and stuff.  How old was she? 
[01:00:30]  Younger than now.  Oh, God.  Is this the neighbor that he banged or no?  No, no, no, no, no.  No.  He's had a couple of those in his day.  He's known her since she was very young, and she used to make, like, you know, crayon  drawings for him and stuff.  Crayon drawings.  It's the greatest thing I've ever heard.  It's the best.  Yeah.  You ever have one of those relationships in your life?  What?  Where there was a girl that, um...  You knew as a little kid, and now you're banging?  You knew as, like, a kid, and then you were banging?  No, not even close.  Yeah, I had one of those. 
[01:01:00]  You did?  Actually, I might have had a couple.  Yeah, yeah, I had one of those.  It was a little sister of a girl that I was banging.  That's hot.  And then it was like, I was going out with the older sister.  How long ago was this?  This was many, many years ago.  This was back in the fucking early 80s, perhaps.  And then the sister grew up?  And then the sister grew up.  We broke up and shit like that.  And then, you know, life went on.  I went about seeing other people and shit.  And then I noticed that the little sister had grown up. 
[01:01:30]  But she was the annoying little sister that used to just prance around and fucking, you  know, be annoying.  What was the age difference between the sisters?  Oh, Christ.  I'm trying to remember.  All I know is this girl was, like, probably nine when I first met her.  Wow.  Yeah.  And then it was like, maybe, you know.  Four years later.  The next week.  Could have been six years later.  Go to Thailand for a special weekend.  Statute of limitations up on statutory. 
[01:02:00]  I don't know what the statute is on that.  Stop saying the word statute.  Statute, statutory.  We get it.  Statute, statutory, statute.  No, I never did that.  She was seven when Tiger met her.  Seven?  Yeah.  Originally.  How old is he?  Tiger.  He's, what is Tiger now?  Thirty, I don't know.  Oh, that's her, huh?  Two or three, maybe.  Tiger's 35?  Wow, I'm losing fucking.  Yeah, that's her.  She's hot.  Yeah, she's hot.  Another blonde.  Loves them blondes.  Loves them. 
[01:02:30]  Unless it's a Perkins waitress.  Then he'll take anything.  She's drawing little pictures.  Little pictures.  Go, Tiger, go.  Mm-hmm.  Oh.  All right, one more.  Spelling Tiger with two Gs.  Messing up the T.  You guys know about Crisis or...  There was another video game that was up here.  They're saying the graphics are ridiculous.  The game Crisis, and there was another one.  I'm sorry.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Yeah, Crisis is what usually, like, PCs will, like, benchmark their graphics cards to.  But that is PC.  You look at a PC thing of Crisis, it's fucking insane that no one... 
[01:03:00]  Crazy.  All right.  A, uh, Brian in Ohio.  Last phone call about video games today.  Or sports video games in general this time around.  Hello?  Hey.  Uh, you guys were talking about how EA Sports is the only, uh, company that knows how to  make sports games.  But, uh, have any of you guys tried the new, uh, NBA 2K?  Yes, I didn't like it because I didn't feel that the Garnett was as good as the, uh, as  the Colby character, and I felt that there was just too much dribbling allowed, but not 
[01:03:30]  enough backboard action on the three-pointers.  Well, you, you didn't try the, uh, Jordan Challenge.  Yes, I did.  I didn't like it.  I thought it was overrated.  Oh, you did?  Yeah, it was overrated.  It was no good.  What are they going to do with Pippen all of a sudden jumping around like that?  Well, I, I enjoyed it.  It was no good.  The graphics were terrible.  The ball, it wasn't giving the same rebound that, like, a metal lock or a curling, you know,  what it had.  It was just not as good.  Well, uh, you should, you should give it another shot, Jimmy. 
[01:04:00]  I gave it two shots.  I was going to give it another one, but I'm like, why would I do more than twice?  I did it twice.  It was no good.  The whole Colby thing wasn't as good.  And then you got King James up, you know, it's like, what am I doing?  Uh, that's a good point, I guess.  All right.  Well, sorry about that, Brian.  Good point, Jim.  All right.  Good point.  Jimmy just didn't see your way.  Jimmy, Jimmy, Jimmy, you know, changed the guy's mind.  Sorry about that, Brian.  In the game, Apple.  All right.  All right, let's go to break.  I've never seen that game. 
[01:04:30]  Don't give it away.  I have to let you know.  I wouldn't know if you played it in front of me and said, this is what I'm playing.  I'd go, really?  And I'd look at your shoes.  You know who's a big sports game guy is Roland.  Roland loves the hockey.  Does he?  And the basketball.  Everything he can't do in real life.  That's why I'm bringing it up, I guess.  Hey, we should go to break with Norm MacDonald.  Comedy Central special.  Oh, my God.  I heard rocked.  And he's going to be in here this week, right?  That guy is fucking out of mind.  He's in here Wednesday. 
[01:05:00]  Cool.  I have to, by the way.  First time for Norm.  We've never met him.  Really?  Yeah.  I've never met Norm all these years.  Never met him.  Big fan.  Always been a big fan of Norm MacDonald.  And now that he's tweeting and he's got this comedy special out, it was so fucking funny.  It's just so Norm.  And then he's doing a sports show for Comedy Central?  I reckon so, huh?  Huh.  What do you want to hear?  Death, battling cancer, or killing a woman as we go to break from his Comedy Central special?  I did not see this yet.  It doesn't even matter. 
[01:05:30]  It really doesn't.  Really?  Any of them.  All right.  We'll go with death.  It's good to be alive.  You know what I mean?  That's what I say.  That's what I like.  That, I find that to be the goodest thing there is.  To be alive.  And the reason it's so good is because it's so bad to be dead.  It's not like life's so great.  But compared to being smothered in earth. 
[01:06:00]  So I just, every day I'm happy.  That's my goal in life, is not to die.  Everybody needs a goal.  And so that's my New Year's resolution every year.  I go, I'm not going to die.  I think, actually, scientists should kind of look into that whole death thing.  Because they seem to focus on diseases. 
[01:06:30]  And, you know, I don't give a **** with them.  Because, you know, the guy goes, hey, we fixed your arthritis.  And they go, I'm still going to die?  And they go, yeah.  So that, I think, is the biggest problem.  That's why I can't get behind politicians, you know?  Because they're always like, our biggest problem today is unemployment.  And I'm like, what about getting old and sick and dying?  And they usher me out the back way, you know? 
[01:07:00]  Seriously, if there was a politician ever that said, by my second term, there will be no death.  I go, I'm voting for that ****.  I'd just give that guy all my money, and I'd sit on a chair.  Sometimes, I actually think I won't die.  You ever think that?  You go, ****, I'm not dying. 
[01:07:30]  But in your mind, when, you know, you analyze, you realize, you know?  Like, you know, my dad died, and my grandfather died, and my great-grandfather died, you know?  And the guy before him, I don't know, probably died.  I think he died.  Because otherwise, he'd be on extra.  No.  I come from a long line of death.  That's my point. 
[01:08:00]  That's my point.  And so I fear it, you know?  I fear it a lot.  And I think most of us do.  You know, but it's funny, like, what we fear, how we're going to die.  There's always the ways we don't die, you know what I mean?  Like, we go, God damn, I hope a polar bear doesn't eat me.  Or some crazy ****, you know?  Or I hope an airplane, you know?  I got an airplane today.  You know, every time you get on an airplane, you go, hope I don't die.  But you never die on an airplane?  Ridiculous. 
[01:08:30]  There you go, I hope a terrorist does not attack and kill me.  I hope that doesn't happen.  You know, I was afraid of that.  But you think about it, what's the odds that a terrorist will attack and kill you?  You know, almost zero, you know?  But, what are the odds that you will be attacked and killed by your own heart?  It's not 100%, you know, are they? 
[01:09:00]  Heart's not good.  People think it is, but people like hearts.  They go, here's a Valentine's heart.  You go, oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  They go, that guy's got a big heart.  I go, he better **** watch it then, because...  And attack and kill him.  I don't know if he knows that. 
[01:09:30]  That's what got my dad.  His heart attacked and killed him.  And he was lying on his bed.  And, boom, dead on the floor.  You know, it was instantly.  And my dad, he wasn't expecting it.  He was looking for **** Arabs and ****.  And his heart attacked and killed him.  And he was dead, like, instantaneously.  And, uh...  Sad.  We were all sad.  The virus.  Sirius XM.  This is the O.P. and Anthony Show. 
[01:10:00]  Hmm.  Hmm.  Skinny.  Bop, bop.  Why would we be playing this?  Well, Bret Michaels is, uh, Bret Michaels is, uh, suing CBS and the Tony Awards for the 2009 decapitation that almost occurred.  That was a close one.  Oh, boy, was it.  That was a heavy **** prop that knocked him down.  Oh, man.  Matty.  So he said, fuck that.  I'm going to get some money out of it, so.  Hence the unskinny bop, bop.  I hear that. 
[01:10:30]  Blow my nose.  Yeah.  This coffee sucks a dick.  It's fucking horrendous.  And, uh, enough already with this shit.  I've had enough of this fucking terrible coffee.  I can't drink this shit.  We need, um, interns, by the way.  Well, we're going to just start going out and getting our own shit.  Yeah, we're going to go out.  There's no other way to do it.  We lost our, uh...  When did we lose our interns?  We didn't lose our interns.  We lost our intern privileges.  When was the last time we had interns?  Fuck.  How long ago? 
[01:11:00]  Well, it's important to the...  It's important to the discussion.  Uh, I think middle of December.  No.  Yeah, right before we went on vacation, we lost the program.  January, February.  All right, so we're three months in without interns because of something that happened.  So they kind of had to punish the entire show, even though we had nothing to do with it.  But a life sentence?  Yeah, a life sentence of no fucking interns is stupid.  I've written my emails.  I've talked to people.  I got Bob involved.  And for some reason, they're not budging on allowing us to have interns anytime soon. 
[01:11:30]  They said something about it's complicated.  And what I would say to SiriusXM, you're hurting one of your shows because it makes it harder to do this show without interns.  There are times where an intern could be doing some busy work and cutting up material that we could be doing on our radio show.  And more importantly, we don't have any fetch-its.  You're turning the creative staff into, yeah, fetch-it people and busy work people because we don't have interns. 
[01:12:00]  So now people that actually do things, you know, they get paid for are doing intern work.  Now they have to take turns to maybe go get breakfast or coffee.  And then Jimmy and I, we're big coffee drinkers, and we need our Starbucks.  This coffee stinks.  They have coffee down the hall.  It's horrendous how bad it is.  So I guess starting today, we have no other choice because they're not listening to us down the hall at all.  We're supposed to be this big, you know, high, I don't know, one of their big shows, I guess. 
[01:12:30]  They don't look at it like that.  I was going to throw a few fun adjectives in there, but supposedly we're a high-profile show for SiriusXM.  But they don't treat us that way whatsoever.  And this is a prime example.  So starting today, this is what we do.  We're going to take turns, and we're going to go get our own fucking coffee and our own breakfast.  And then maybe you'll see what we're talking about here.  Because just as the other people on the staff have a job to do, and they're pulled from that job to do intern busy work, 
[01:13:00]  why shouldn't we share in that burden so we can show you how much it affects the show by leaving the show to just go and pick up things?  Right.  Like, I know in a little while I'm going to want probably a little turkey chili, and I am going to personally take the elevator, go downstairs, go into the place, buy it, and then come back.  And I won't be on the air for a few minutes.  A few?  That's easily 15, 20 minutes.  But hey, you know, that's what they chose to do, by the way.  They chose to not give us the staffing to do that stuff. 
[01:13:30]  So now we have to take it amongst ourselves.  And by the way, this isn't a silly fucking bit, like, we're going to have fun with this.  No, this is what we're really going to do.  That's what we're doing.  Because I want my Starbucks coffee, and I try, and people are like, I can't.  There's no one here to go on a coffee run for you guys.  All right, so I go and get my own coffee for now.  How about yourself?  20 minutes less radio every day because I have to get another cup of coffee.  I can certainly live with that.  No problem.  Take a little walk.  They don't give a fuck if it's hurting the show.  So now we show you what we do. 
[01:14:00]  God, this place fucking hates us.  Enough already.  I don't.  It's just a typical corporation.  It's all corporations are like this.  Yeah, but there's one guy.  There's one guy in that corner fucking office, and I called him out last week, so I'll take  a break from mentioning his name.  No matter what's going on with human resources and all that, one fucking guy can march upstairs  and go, enough, let these guys have fucking interns.  But he has chosen not to do that for whatever reason.  But then he'll see you in the hall and he'll smile, hey, hey, what can I do for you? 
[01:14:30]  There's nothing you can do for me because it's all bullshit.  This whole place is bullshit when it comes to this crap.  For this show.  No, everyone comes to the table for this show when there's shit that they don't want us  to do and bits that we can't do because the lawyer said so.  But we never get like this defense from them.  They never go, all right, you know what?  We're going to go and talk to this person about this situation.  It's just like, whatever shit happens, they go like, well, that shit happened and there's  nothing we can do about it, so just do your show without it. 
[01:15:00]  Well, the lawyers aren't just shitty to us.  Let's be very honest.  If you look at other things that might be happening.  Shitty to the planet Earth.  They're shitty to a lot of people around here.  So, you know, we shouldn't feel alone with that.  They just, it is what it is.  That's what they are.  But this is, one semester we're willing to take the hit.  All right, one semester we're willing to take.  I didn't mind one semester.  I didn't mind it.  No.  No.  I didn't mind it.  Just never, no.  No, you can't accept that.  No, no, I don't.  Because then they're going to take more.  But here it is.  They should have never taken our interns away from us because we had nothing to do with 
[01:15:30]  that incident.  If they want to, if there's some weird punishment plea bargain thing we have to do where we go,  all right, we'll go a semester without, believe me, I wouldn't agree with it either.  No, no, because the person that was involved in the incident was punished.  It doesn't matter.  So that should have been the end of it.  But it's inconsequential because they gave us a life sentence.  They didn't give us fucking a semester without interns.  They gave us a life sentence of no fucking interns based on something stupid. 
[01:16:00]  So fucking, it's not worth, the punishment is not worth the crime.  Right.  So knock it the fuck off and get us some stupid interns.  Well.  Literally, some real stupid ones.  Final, man, Scott Greenstein, get our interns back.  Yeah.  I point to you today because you're the guy, what can I do for you?  What can I do?  What can I do?  Everything all right?  No, no, it's not all right.  Get us our interns back.  Start there.  Enough with the, I got it, I got it, I got it, I got it, I got it.  And do something. 
[01:16:30]  Get our interns back.  Get our interns back.  Or we start, no, we start leaving today to get our own shit.  Enough already.  We should have our interns.  It's ridiculous.  Enough.  Enough.  Yes.  We're not having a date of them coming back.  Not to say, okay, look, starting April 8th or May 1st, you're going to have them.  No, no, the spring semester is about to start, more or less.  Yeah.  Okay.  No, we're in the middle of the spring semester, right?  Now I'm confused.  I just said yes, because I'm phony.  I don't know.  I'm sorry.  All right.  So the spring semester will end in May, early June, and they already said no interns for  summer. 
[01:17:00]  So now the-  For summer?  Yeah.  Best case scenario is next fall.  And we'll revisit it.  That famous word.  We'll revisit it.  Revisit.  What the fuck, man?  Children.  If you don't want us here, just fucking tell us.  I don't need to be here.  Trust me.  I have no problem walking at this point.  But I'm not going to be treated like fucking shit every day.  Get our interns back.  I don't want to see Gary or Rob or even Steve, no offense, and I like Steve, anymore until  we have our interns back. 
[01:17:30]  Because everything else doesn't mean shit until we do that.  The basics of a radio show.  Yeah, it is a basic.  It really is silly.  And Greenstein, enough with the, what can I do for you?  Because you do nothing for us whatsoever.  You let us down every fucking time.  Every fucking time when you could do something for your high profile show, you choose not to.  And now it's gotten to the point where we don't even have fucking interns.  It's an embarrassment.  Oh, someone's going to have a meeting.  I ain't doing no fucking meetings.  I will walk before I have one of those yell-in-my-face meetings. 
[01:18:00]  I'm done with all of that.  Uh-oh.  All of that.  Oh, boy.  I really think that they're...  I'm not having a meeting with nobody.  I didn't know that the summer was counted out.  I didn't realize that.  Yes.  Until just now.  So starting today, we get our own shit.  Yeah.  They don't give a fuck.  Fine.  And they'll be like, that's crazy.  No, it's not.  We don't want to drink the shitty coffee.  And I don't want fucking boring dry cereal every morning.  Right.  I want to go and get myself a nice egg platter or something.  Something the interns did and no one even noticed.  Right. 
[01:18:30]  And then there's also times where...  There was a couple of bits last week we wanted to do.  And we didn't have people that could cut up the audio because they were busy doing other stuff.  And that would have been a job for an intern.  That's what happens.  So it's affecting the on-air product.  Is it human resources?  Who is saying...  One guy could go above all that shit.  Who is saying no?  And for how long?  I don't know.  I had Bob on it, but Bob's useless as far as that goes. 
[01:19:00]  What did he say?  It's complicated.  It's one of those fucking corporate things where our agent doesn't have a say.  in fucking corporate business like that.  So they're just like, well, yeah.  He has a say with Greenstein, though.  Well, I don't even know.  He's supposed to have a say with him.  I don't even know if...  If it's human resources, I don't even know if Scott can override human resources.  I don't know if he can.  Obviously, there was an incident.  And obviously, the person was punished for that incident. 
[01:19:30]  Right.  And that should be the end of it.  If you wanted to do more at the time, then you should have.  But how we see it is it's over now.  So that means you bring the fucking interns back.  Right.  With some strict rules if you have to.  Whatever you have to fucking do.  Yeah, whatever you need to do.  But to punish us, it's ridiculous.  Uh-huh.  I had nothing to do with it.  Nothing.  Dummies.  And it all started because we want another cup of coffee.  And this coffee is so fucking bad.  It's horrendous. 
[01:20:00]  Is the coffee good?  It's all right.  It's horrible.  And I'm not a big Starbucks fan, to be honest with you.  But it's way better than this.  Yeah, this is really irritating.  Smells delicious.  Does it?  Oh, it's caramel French melon.  Well, because you have to flavor it up.  You have to flavor it.  I hope that it'll make it taste somewhat drinkable.  I threw my whole cup out.  I can't even sip it.  I want to fucking double espresso with Sambuca.  I drink that coffee every day.  Is it good?  It's terrible.  Does it give you good shits?  I hate it.  I don't know.  Coffee doesn't do that. 
[01:20:30]  I mean, you've got to be a rookie to shit from coffee still.  I don't know.  I've been shitting from coffee for fucking 20 years.  Really?  It don't do it for anyone.  Oh, my God.  It gets in there.  It's the fucking stool loosener.  Nah, man.  Not me, man.  It puts that weight.  You know, my friend described this shit great.  I had this shit while we were, when I was in Florida shooting.  And one of the writers, I'm like, I have to shit so bad.  He goes, do you have that telltale heaviness in your back?  And I'm like, that is, what a great description.  Fucking telltale heaviness. 
[01:21:00]  Telltale heaviness in the back.  That's great.  Good one.  Fuck yeah, man.  Shit.  That's exactly what it is.  Oh, well, you know.  Go ahead, Terry.  Because you know.  Because you know our lifestyles.  Go ahead, Terry.  Go ahead with your stupid fucking phone call.  Go ahead, Terry.  Hi, Terry.  Go ahead.  Listen to this fucking idiot.  All right.  Let's listen.  Terry?  I'm playing devil's advocate here, but I'm thinking, why can't you just eat breakfast  before the show?  Oh, there's an idea.  All right.  So I should eat breakfast between 4.30 and 5 in the morning when you have no fucking 
[01:21:30]  desire to eat at that point.  And then go all the way to 10 to 10.30 without eating again, right?  Well, it's a four-hour show.  I mean, most guys like.  No, it's not a four-hour show.  No, we're here before that, preparing.  It's too early, Terry.  I'm going to start having dinner at 3 in the morning just to get it taken care of.  That'll leave me more time in the afternoon.  And even though we joke about stuff, you know, we do do other stuff after the fucking show, 
[01:22:00]  Terry.  You said doo-doo.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Well, to the elevator?  It's not just a four-hour show, you asshole.  To the elevator.  I buy gum and practice karate.  Yeah, to the elevator because you believe every word we say.  That's exactly what happens.  We run to the elevator every day.  That is true, but.  Fucking idiot.  It's just too early, Terry.  You eat at 4.30 in the morning.  Get up tomorrow and eat at 4.30 in the morning and don't eat again until, well, and then you  got to get back home.  So until 11 in the morning and see how you feel. 
[01:22:30]  Well, I drive a truck.  I got odd ball hours too, you know, but you got to just adapt to it.  You're probably eating while you're making this phone call.  Shut up.  Is that good?  Hey, dude, do you have to, do you got to load your own truck?  Get on the forklift and load it?  Uh, no, no.  Oh, you don't, huh?  Oh, really?  Hey, how about you do that in lieu of eating?  How about that?  How about your boss tells you, by the way, you know those guys in the forklifts when you  pull up to a loading dock?  They're not going to be there.  So you load the shit up. 
[01:23:00]  And how about, how about that?  Yeah, do you got to pump your own gas?  Right.  He's probably going to say yes to the guy who gives bad examples.  I'm just not saying what that has to do with anything.  I mean, I try.  Oh, I'm trying to make an analogy.  Yeah.  Terry, the point is, logically, it doesn't make sense.  All kidding aside, I, I, I, I can't eat at 4.35 in the morning.  It's too early, buddy.  It's too early.  And I'm not like him where he, he can eat a tiny little piece of bread and he's good  for six hours.  I got to constantly eat for whatever reason. 
[01:23:30]  I take a little sandwich.  I go, and I eat it.  Yeah.  And then I'm fine until like fucking next week.  I get very hungry at like seven o'clock.  We have to eat during the breaks and you eat.  It's, it's, it's what you do, man.  It's hard to have energy at this hour.  That's right.  I probably don't understand your situation.  Maybe that's it.  Honestly, it's just different.  Cause when we were doing afternoon drive, you're, you would be absolutely right.  I would eat before the show, a lunch, and I'd be completely fine for the entire show.  But something with mornings, I don't know.  It's cause it's your first meal of the day. 
[01:24:00]  You got to eat a little more and you got to, you got to throw a little  more food in you.  Having interns is, is part of it on a radio.  Every radio show has them.  Every single radio show has them.  Plus the interaction we had with the interns gave us some of the best radio over the past  six or seven years.  And by the way, when they do come back, they're not allowed to have interaction with them.  Oh, isn't it?  Cause they know how to do radio.  What do you mean they can't have interaction with them?  What are we, Mark Parenteau?  Because we might, you know, we might do something stupid.  We can have them on the air. 
[01:24:30]  I don't think so.  I really don't think so.  Wow.  I need a Snickers bar.  You're right, Rob.  You're absolutely right.  Oh.  We can't have them on the air anymore.  That's gotta be a mistake.  We can't even have them.  But I mean, once they come back, when we're all, we'll have 50 year old interns.  All right.  Enjoy that.  Enjoy that discussion.  Cause I'm not having it.  At least fucking ask them.  I haven't had it.  I would like to know when.  I have not.  I just happened to ask before.  Like, how do we get in the back?  Ask during the break.  Ask during the break and tell me what they say.  Is anybody here?  Are they here?  I don't know. 
[01:25:00]  I have no idea.  I haven't seen real bosses in years.  Working here reminds me of like, sometimes like a, like a George Orwell thing.  Or like, like, you remember 2001 Space Odyssey, how it was just like, it was just this, he  was alone.  There was just like giant computer around him.  That's what this feels like.  There's, there's no way you have to grab somebody and go, hey, and then just have that moment.  Right.  Where you get things done.  You can't.  It's all like, I feel like I'm talking to cyborgs who have to put the information into  the main computer and it will filter back to me somehow.  At some point, maybe. 
[01:25:30]  Their logic as a company, I'll say it again, is to pay one guy a shitload and everybody  else just kind of hangs out and hope, and they all hope they get a better opportunity  outside these walls.  That's, that was their philosophy.  And if it works for them, great.  But that's, that's what they decided a long time ago.  This place is based on one show.  We're like the background sweat hogs.  Yeah.  And welcome back to Potter.  Oh, fuck, is that a great analogy?  Remember they had like the cast and that's down the hall, the main cast, your barberinos  and your stuff.  And then we're the one in the background that goes, ah, ha, ha, man, laughs when Epstein 
[01:26:00]  makes a joke.  Do they have background sweat hogs?  Yeah, they did.  They're terrible.  I think Hotsy Totsy was in there.  She was one.  Who's that?  I don't know.  A sweat hog.  What is that?  What a terrible name.  Terrible.  That show was awful.  Yeah, you put a dick in my face.  Vinny, Bob, a head up and down.  You get it?  Yes.  On a male friend near an airplane stairway.  Arnold horse hung. 
[01:26:30]  Of course.  Yes, of course.  Ah, shit, man.  So, it's frustrating.  It's just all bullshit.  Because the one guy tells you, what can he do for you?  And then you tell him, well, this is something you can do.  And it's never anything too crazy.  Ah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  I got it.  I got it.  I got it.  I got it.  I look into that.  I got it.  I got it.  Jiminy Cricket.  That was their company's philosophy.  And we'll see if it works out for them in the end.  It's just whatever. 
[01:27:00]  I don't run this place.  They do.  They decided to run it their way.  What do you got, Ant?  I saw Nick DiPaolo on Friday night, by the way.  Oh, you did?  Ended up going to Governors.  I went to Governors.  Nice.  I saw Nick DiPaolo.  That motherfucker is funny, man.  Yes, he is.  Holy shit.  And he, let me just say, he doesn't take any guff.  No.  From anyone in the crowd.  Wow.  What happened?  It's just like, it's what happened.  The typical thing that happens these days in a comedy club, especially one like, you 
[01:27:30]  know, a Governor.  I'm not talking like just some shithole comedy club.  Governors is a nice place.  You know, they got a nice bar and a bunch of tables and shit.  They do a good job over there.  It's a good crowd.  The place was packed.  You know, a bunch of Long Island white trash in there to go get some ha-has for the night.  And Nick gets up and he's doing his stuff.  And he just looks over at one point and he goes, this table full of fucking women won't  shut the fuck up.  And then they kind of quieted down for a second.  But then, had to be five minutes later. 
[01:28:00]  They start up.  He's like, are you, are you, are you really, really are you doing this?  You done?  And then, of course, branches into it.  That's the problem with the world.  Cunts like you.  And it's fucking, Nick is classic.  Just takes it way too far.  Oh, but it's so good.  It's just like, if you fucking hit Nick with a pea shooter, he'll fucking turn a howitzer  into your face and just let you have it.  He's really fucking funny, though, man.  Yeah, he's really funny.  If you get a chance to see Nick DePaulo, I greatly recommend it. 
[01:28:30]  I don't understand why people go to a comedy club and feel like it's a social event.  Because there are assholes everywhere.  It's like, it's pretty much going to see a movie, except it's in 3D for you.  And it's going to be a lot funnier than most movies.  But they talk in movie theaters, too.  People on cell phones in movie theaters.  People are pigs.  In general, they've figured out, okay, maybe I shouldn't really talk in movie theaters.  You're right.  There's people that still do that.  But why would you go to a comedy show and assume that it's time to socialize in between?  Yeah.  Because your attention span sucks a dick. 
[01:29:00]  There was one point where some other people were talking.  Because Nick likes taking those little breather gaps where there's nothing.  And then he even complains about that.  He's like, why is it like you feel it's got to be talking all the time?  Because if I'm not talking up here, it doesn't mean it's your turn to fucking talk.  So some guy in the crowd, it's all quiet while he's just kind of like that after he told the crowd that.  And some guy from in the back just yells out, sorry, Nick.  And it was funny. 
[01:29:30]  It was like Nick starts laughing.  He's like, all right, no problem, no problem.  But then you know the dick couldn't just leave it at that.  Like I got a good line in, made the people laugh.  It calmed the atmosphere down, let Nick do his act.  Are you saying the guy was feeling good about himself?  Now he's feeling like the comic.  Now he feels the comedy club is reversed 180 degrees.  He's on the stage.  He's looking for the owner to put his name on the fucking billboard.  Put his picture up outside.  He'll sign it for the owner.  Put his little catchphrase, we're sorry, Nick, on there. 
[01:30:00]  Some guy's got to realize, look, great line.  One line, take and go.  And I'm gone.  Do a Costanza.  Leave.  Get up and go.  And then he had to go like, you know, hey, we love you, Nick.  Like just the same yelling thing, thinking it's going to happen again.  And by that point, one of the security guys from the club was up there where the guy yelled.  He kind of went up in the corner.  And he's just looking in that direction, waiting.  Because even they know.  They've been in the business long enough to know. 
[01:30:30]  This motherfucker ain't going to shut up.  And he's going to do it again.  And he did.  And the guy just walks over there, gave him a firm talking to.  And we heard nothing more from that guy the rest of the night.  He'd have been thrown out if he said another word.  I heckle sometimes.  I used to get laughed.  Are you good at it?  Oh, yeah.  The best.  I saw Nick one time.  He was on stage.  I'm like, yeah, what are you, Italian or something?  The whole place is going nuts.  Yeah, it's like a bunch of the Sopranos were up on the stage with you. 
[01:31:00]  Oh, man, I must have killed.  Huh?  He told me to go fuck my mother.  Did he?  Yeah.  What did you do?  I was with a pregnant lady.  And he said he hopes the baby was born dead.  Oh.  Which, by the way, it is alleged he said that to an actor one time.  Jesus.  Oh, yeah, I know.  Couldn't have been born perfect.  I don't doubt it.  He wished death on people in the audience in horrid ways.  Hey, why not?  That had me roaring laughing.  If you're going to be rude enough to talk in a comedy club.  Yes.  He can't hit you.  Yeah. 
[01:31:30]  We're not allowed to hit.  Yeah.  So, you know, you fucking do the best thing.  You're going to wreck the audience tonight?  Well, we're going to wreck yours.  But he is so good at it in that Nick DiPaolo kind of way.  Like, everyone handles people differently.  Like, you seem to be one of the most cordial people I've ever seen.  You'll rip people apart that are saying shit, but it'll be very funny, and it won't be,  unless it's some bitch that won't stop.  It depends on where it's, it's weird.  Like, you feel where it's coming from, and if I feel like they're trying to have a good 
[01:32:00]  time.  Oh, okay.  If I feel like they're being dicks, I tend to get really vicious.  Just the addictive asshole and shit like that.  I hate them.  Because I've seen, you know, different comics handled it different ways, and the way Nick  handles it, man, he's just fucking brutal.  I love it.  I've seen him yell in crowds at the cellar sometimes.  But, like, literally, I'm like, why did he yell?  Why is he yelling?  Like, he says something really harsh, like, you know what?  I hope fucking, I hope fucking Hillary Clinton, I hope a bomb goes off in her asshole. 
[01:32:30]  And then one girl will go, oh, you fucking liberal cunt.  What are you groaning?  Oh, really?  You groaning?  Really?  Like, that's going to happen.  I'm going to say that, and a bomb's going to explode in her asshole.  What's wrong with you, you stupid cunt?  It's always enjoyable.  Yeah.  Why the anger from Nick, you think?  I don't know.  Where does that come from?  Oh, he's had enough.  He's just had it with people.  He's just had it with the bullshit.  It's a great, great anger.  It comes from a great place.  Yeah. 
[01:33:00]  I swear, that could be my brother.  Your brother has anger.  No, no, I mean, Nick could be my brother.  Oh, yeah, of course.  It's just one of those situations where it's like, I really agree with a lot of stuff.  That man says it.  You, Nick, and Sean Hannity should get it over with and just start a network or a radio show,  whatever the fuck.  Sean's a little too...  It needs to happen.  Sean's a little too on the up and up for anything like that, believe me.  You end up tweeting that picture because I certainly did.  Oh, yeah, the one where...  You did, too?  Where high four-ing, high three-ing. 
[01:33:30]  You and Sean are trying to do a high five, and just awkwardly are two white guys missing.  You know what I think that was, though?  That picture is classic.  Yeah, I think we had high five, and we were coming apart from the high five.  Yeah, I think so, too.  But, you know, I'm not going to try to justify that I know how to give a high five.  I tweeted that one, too.  But it was something, you know, of course, we were laughing about some Democratic asshole  doing something stupid.  The assholes were me and Imus.  Oh, Imus.  We were fucking high-fiving off camera.  That was going to be me and me and Hannity weren't high-fiving Steve from Bajor. 
[01:34:00]  Why wouldn't Imus have taped that?  I don't know.  No, it was...  Like, I look at the pictures and think, wow, that looks really cool, you know, the set.  You tape it.  You know, we were up there, I don't know, a half hour, probably.  Yeah.  And he did other stuff, too.  He would have got easily ten minutes of good radio out of it.  How long was the show?  Two hours?  You don't have to play the whole fucking thing.  I don't know.  Yeah, it was the other Jersey Boys get up there and sing some Jersey Boys stuff.  Yeah.  Yeah, it was a whole night of hijinks and shenanigans.  All right, what are we doing for coffee? 
[01:34:30]  I have an announcement to make, but I'm not going to make it right now.  I'm going to make it in exactly 11 minutes.  Oh, my God.  Wait a minute.  One, two, three, four, four, five.  All right, we'll break that.  Why a little bit after 8 a.m.?  Because it's 7.53 and every good radio guy knows that 8.04 is the best time for announcements  on the East Coast.  Oh.  It's true.  I'm writing a book about radio and the intricacies of it.  Is this, let me ask, is this a show that I'll be able to go to? 
[01:35:00]  It's one you'd want to.  Oh, yeah?  Because of the location.  Oh, is it a place where I could probably leave with a lot less money?  No, we're not having it in a liquor store.  Oh, boy.  Did I lob that one in?  Yeah, you really did.  I was just trying to think, where can you fuck kids?  That's no good.  It's amazing how your mind goes. 
[01:35:30]  Shit, that's great.  How can I hurt him the most?  He hit that right back at you.  Oh, he certainly did.  You took that right on the skull.  Bravissimo.  One of them you can, yeah.  I have three dates to announce for antisocial, and one of them you absolutely can leave with  a lot less money.  All right.  Three more dates.  I'm there.  Yeah, I'll just announce.  No.  Do it before the break.  Yeah, before the break.  Washington, D.C., May 13th.  Oh, that's the place where I can leave with a lot less money.  Yeah, I didn't even think of that.  You certainly could.  Freeze, motherfucker.  And Chicago and Vegas dates also. 
[01:36:00]  Oh!  Just go to antisocialcomedy.com for those dates.  Vegas?  They'll be announced tomorrow, but those three, Chicago, D.C., and Vegas will be on sale very  soon.  That's fucking great.  Yeah, I'm very happy about that.  I might have to go to Vegas.  That's awesome.  I think I've got to go to Vegas.  It's at the Palms in Vegas.  When?  Summer?  Where the fuck is...  I can't wait.  It doesn't go on sale.  It's July 2nd.  It doesn't go on sale... 
[01:36:30]  Fourth of July weekend in Vegas?  Fourth of July weekend in Vegas.  That could be fun, man.  April 8th it goes on sale, but that's a week from Friday.  But yeah, that's actually going to be a great one.  I'm looking forward to Vegas.  Fourth of July weekend in Vegas?  What are you thinking?  What are you thinking?  I'm thinking that could be doable.  I'm thinking.  Keith, get on it.  Yeah, the Palms is supposed to...  I haven't been to the Palms in many years.  It's supposed to be fucking the hottest hotel.  I remember seeing Dino there.  It was wonderful.  Years ago.  Really?  No.  Of course not.  That old.  That was the songs.  Eight years old, sitting there smoking a cigar, watching Dean Martin at the 
[01:37:00]  Palms.  Wish.  So yeah, this Friday, a couple of them go on sale.  Just go to antisocialcomedy.com and...  Oh, bravo.  Listen, very good, Jimmy.  When we get back, the Abercrombie story, we definitely got to do.  Oh, yeah.  And we also got to do the...  Should I say it?  What is it?  Yeah, there's some kind of fucking...  Prostitute cards are circulating in Queens.  In Queens.  It's a great story.  They're giving these things out.  Kids are bringing them home.  It's a very crazy story.  And we're finally going to take care of some of the fat fucks that listen to this 
[01:37:30]  radio show.  Oh, come on now.  He's in there.  He's doing a good job today.  He hasn't done one bad thing.  Well, Iroh gave you the eye roll.  He's like a writer already.  I get it.  I didn't mean you, Iroh.  Have you dropped a few pounds?  Yes, I did.  Yes, thanks for those.  Yeah.  Have you?  Yes.  No, not you, Dan.  Danny, you don't need to lose weight.  You have a body to die for.  Iroh?  I have no idea.  Oh, God, Iroh.  You do have an eye.  You haven't dropped any pounds.  Oh.  Have you dropped a few?  I don't think I did, no.  You look like you put a few on. 
[01:38:00]  That's what I'm saying.  Oh, thanks.  Oh, God.  He dropped a few pounds on his ass, his belly, his neck.  Chest dropped a little bit more.  Belly dropped a little more.  Oh, shit.  Oh, Iroh.  Listen.  Is your girl still encouraging you to work out?  Yeah.  I love that she was just trying to be subtle and go look.  I know.  I married you.  Like, it's encouragement to just, hey.  She's hot, man.  You better work out.  She's in good shape, dude.  She's fucking sexy.  Watch out.  Ange is very sexy.  She's a very pretty girl.  Watch out, man.  Guy's a fucking pig. 
[01:38:30]  You're batting way out of your league with her.  Yeah.  No reason you should be with her.  No, not at all.  She should absolutely.  She should not be with the guy running the board.  No.  Fucking Iraq rules.  Not at all.  Amazing.  He just knows his place.  It's hilarious.  Anyway, for the fat fucks out there, we got Joe Cross coming in today.  I saw this documentary.  Fat, Sick, and Nearly Dead.  I like a good documentary.  It's pretty good.  It's about a guy that juiced for, I want to say, oh shit, 60 days? 
[01:39:00]  Longer.  Roland will tell me.  I forget.  Of just fucking drinking that juice from a juicer?  An Australian comes to America and just travels the country talking about out of shape  and fat people.  Talking about his juice.  And turning people on to juicing.  And he did it and lost a shitload of weight.  Fucking meets a truck driver.  And that's why this documentary is really good.  I wanted to see this.  I'm annoyed I didn't see this before he came in because I have a copy of it.  And the truck driver meets this guy and basically says, please help me.  And I'm thinking, there's no way the truck driver is going to do the right thing in the  end.  But, I mean, let's be honest. 
[01:39:30]  It's obvious he does.  But the journey is pretty good how he gets there.  So Joe Cross is coming in to talk about the documentary.  Very cool.  I liked it.  I definitely liked it.  So we'll do that as well at 9 o'clock.  Bless you.  The virus.  Get in touch with the O.P. and Anthony Show.  866-WOW-1-WOW.  Send your feedback to feedback at obianthony.com.  O.P. and Anthony.  This is for Lady Gaga's birthday? 
[01:40:00]  I know the Kenny bit for Lady Gaga's birthday.  Talking to E-Rock, huh?  Was that on the air or just my side of the conversation?  I think just your side.  Oh, wonderful.  Lady Gaga's 25, so that's why we did Kenny singing Bed Romance, I guess.  Wow.  Everything has to make sense now on our show.  Everything that we play has to make sense on our show now. 
[01:40:30]  Yeah, yeah.  Every little thing needs a reason.  Right.  I'm surprised there's not an ACDC tidbit right here for everybody.  He might be coming in soon.  That's why we're playing this.  Thank you.  Ah.  Who, Brian Johnson?  Wow, really?  Yeah, I think it's Brian Johnson.  So you're talking to you more into your, uh...  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  It's a wonderful...  The magical talking system?  Yeah, making me sound like a complete load of tech.  Yeah.  Like I'm talking to myself.  But I'm actually having a conversation with E-Rock.  A one-sided conversation.  Yes.  Ah, what do we got? 
[01:41:00]  Oh, the prostitute cards.  Yes.  Yeah, I heard this story driving in, and I heard it last night on the news, too, and saw  some footage.  People are very angry at this.  People in the neighborhood in Queens that these are being handed out in and just left  on the sidewalk.  You know, shit, like they, especially in places like Vegas, there are people that just hand  cards out and shit.  The Guatemalans.  For prostitutes and stuff.  They're Guatemalans, though, that are handing them out.  They don't even speak English.  They don't even know what they're handing out, I think.  No, no, they don't know.  They're little business cards. 
[01:41:30]  But they're, um...  Wait, can I tell you that this used to happen on the Upper West Side?  Yeah.  Yeah.  They call them, like, Chica cards or something?  Oh, I don't know.  And they're Hispanic women that are available for prostitution, and they're handed out by,  you know, people that, I guess, the pimps get a hold of and hand these things out.  But the parents are very up in arms.  They used to have...  The hookers would put them on your windshield on the Upper West Side, but they decided to  clean that shit up.  Yeah.  And the limo prostitutes.  Limo prostitutes.  Yeah.  That's right. 
[01:42:00]  The guy would drive the prostitutes around, and he'd jump in the limo for a little action.  Oh.  That was a biggie.  That was happening on the Upper West Side, too.  Business cards for the limo prostitutes.  So it's a little more high-end than what you're about to talk about here, Ann, is what I'm  saying.  I got it.  Well, these things are...  I saw pictures of them.  They look pretty good.  They look pretty good?  Yeah.  They're like...  They're on very good paper, thick, nice color to them.  Really?  Yeah.  Well, let's get the news story out of the way first here, and then we'll discuss it. 
[01:42:30]  10-10 wins.  Was John Montone on the scene?  I don't think it was John Montone.  Why not?  This is perfect for him.  I know.  We spoke with people.  I drove to Queens for no apparent reason to speak to people.  I like it.  And let's go to John Montone out at Yankee Stadium at 4.30 in the morning to talk about  opening day coming up.  I'm here at Yankee Stadium for no reason.  I could have done this from the studio.  Right.  I don't understand that. 
[01:43:00]  I don't know.  If you say you're somewhere on radio, they'll believe you.  You don't have to be there, John.  For the rest of the show, we're in Vegas.  Yeah.  Who's going to call us out on that?  Ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding,  ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding.  Actually, if we were in Vegas, you'd be very drunk, and you wouldn't be here right now.  You wouldn't even hear me.  Yeah.  You would have some action on the table.  You'd be like, off to the side.  Seven police.  Motherfucker.  So here's the story.  Too bad it's not our pal, John Montone.  We love this guy.  But it's a good story.  Anyway.  You can find business-sized cards depicting naked women and advertising their services littering Roosevelt Avenue here in Corona. 
[01:43:30]  Duberky Pacheco found three of them near PS19 where her young girls go to school.  So that's not good, because they ask them, what happened with this?  She says it's tough for parents to explain these sexually explicit cards to younger kids.  State Senator Jose Peralta says some of the older kids are using them inappropriately.  They're beginning to collect these cards like baseball cards, and they're trading them like baseball cards. 
[01:44:00]  He says the cards advertise prostitution, so distributing them should be illegal.  Oh, kids will be kids.  It should be illegal to distribute them.  Oh, stop.  It's not illegal.  It's not illegal.  Are they naked?  No, they're bikini-clad.  They've got thongs on with their asses hanging out.  That's what they look like?  Dude, Vegas has been doing this for years.  Those are the cards.  You missed the break.  Oh, I missed the beginning.  Okay.  Yeah, we talked about how you walk around, and they've got the Guatemalans, basically, on the corners, like, handing these things out.  And they make this noise when you walk by? 
[01:44:30]  Yes, I forgot about that noise.  Yeah, yeah, they snap them.  They slap them against their hand, so you hear and look.  And you look, and once you look, they hand them to you.  Put them out.  Yeah, they slap them.  But they have a way of slapping.  It's like, yeah, they have a rhythm, too.  Like, ta-ta-ta-ta-hir.  It's a very hard crack sound to it.  Crack, crack, crack.  I didn't realize they look so nice.  They do look like baseball cards.  I don't see a problem with this at all.  I don't see a problem.  Chica nude baseball cards for the kids.

Wow, they smell like whore.  can i say i i have to do a bit of self-promotion i didn't realize that please i was in the post  yesterday they quoted the joke i can't fucking believe they quoted the joke i sent him what  was it i fucking can't believe they put that in the post fucking they're talking about putting 
[01:48:00]  a mosque very close to ground zero i don't think they should it's like putting a condom machine  in the lobby of a rape crisis center they fucking put that in the post wow i can't believe they  fucking put that in i had to be an oversight i can't fucking believe it had to be an oversight  somebody was sleeping on the job they would never put something that's what i sent them it's a great  line don't don't get me wrong wow wow for them to say yeah what the hell let's put yeah that's ballsy  i'm i'm a little self-promotion i wish there was somebody else's when i was saying that but they're  probably desperate no no i mean probably you know people aren't buying papers as much yeah the papers 
[01:48:30]  the papers although i like uh like the the scans on some of the papers now oh really what do they  got well you take your fucking smartphone you scan and you get more info on a story or something  so that's kind of cool oh we take a little like with your camera code or whatever the barcode  reader that's pretty fucking well something like if you want to read more up on this or whatever just  barcode this right now it'll pop up on your smartphone for more information click here  it's that's a cool technology that is pretty good could could uh save the papers a little bit 
[01:49:00]  maybe i don't know i don't know why anyone has papers anywhere like i get two newspapers here too  in the morning like everyone else and i thumb through them just because they're there but i don't  need them and i'm not reading anything that i haven't seen online or heard anywhere else already  speaking of technology did you hear about the new app called color they did a story on it yesterday  oh i thought you meant the other one named um some saying it could be the next step in social  networking really and the guy who got the idea i believe he already sold two companies or two ideas 
[01:49:30]  the first one he made about 800 million off the second one he made about 80 million off and this  is his third one and jesus they already have like 41 million dollars invested in the company which is  unheard of for like a new idea what's the uh gist of it basically the guy got i think he got the idea  you know when you go to weddings and um everyone has disposables at the table yeah so you know all  of a sudden the event is you know oh this is what i saw bud right so he goes wow that would be kind 
[01:50:00]  of cool in the real world so i guess the app is if i heard this uh correctly let's say you're in  times square is a perfect example ah and you're taking pictures like crazy and you're part of this  new social networking app or whatever called color anyone else that has that app within 150 feet could  uh automatically get your pictures on their phone all right within 150 feet i think it's 150 feet  right now so if they're near you anyone near you if you have the app and you're allowing the app 
[01:50:30]  then they get your stuff and they're talking about mostly for pictures but also you know for uh  tweets and stuff like that do you see whatever whatever the tweets would be called in this new  company these little things like that that guy that was in here said we're all going to be like  with computers yeah we're all becoming this is like little weird steps like you silently take  photos and upload them and i now have them it's this weird fucking connection it is kind of weird  a hundred more years of computers right dude we are all going to be fucking linked your thoughts are 
[01:51:00]  going to be linked i'm not even saying it's bad it's just natural evolution yeah and and it's evolved  so slowly relatively speaking that that we kind of don't realize but think about this what you're  seeing and think of this in the terms of of old history where you couldn't even fathom that this  was happening what you are seeing at any given moment you can take that take your vision and put  it on a machine and then send your vision to someone else right anywhere in the world and they can 
[01:51:30]  instantly see what you're looking at right that right there is something that was pure science fiction  yeah it was witchcraft and and you couldn't yeah you couldn't possibly even 10 years ago it sort of  was yeah i mean you could technically go home and upload it to your computer and email it it was like  now but now it's instant like you're saying now i mean video like to be able to send in real time  like with uh facetime and shit like that right here's what i'm looking at right at this moment and 
[01:52:00]  here's what i'm hearing this is my experience that i'm having right now and you're privy to it right  based on this little device it never would have fucking but this this new technology you could  play mortal kombat with a friend in vietnam but this this new technology i love that but this color  thing is is kind of cool though right yeah yeah because now you're right let's say you're at a  concert imagine you're at a concert and you know all the the younger kids certainly will jump on an 
[01:52:30]  app like that say you're at a cool concert whatever bonnaroo or whatever and all of a sudden  a whole shit load of you have the app and now you're all taking pictures and now you're just  you're scrolling through it like your twitter going wow this guy just saw this you know this girl's  passed down the bathroom i would have never saw that here it is kind of good for people in in a group  uh i i don't know about individuals i think they said only 100 i think they said only 150 feet but i'm  sure that would expand if this thing got popular you know and then i would imagine if you really like 
[01:53:00]  someone's pictures maybe you can make them part of your thing where now whenever they take pictures  outside the 150 range maybe you do get those you're a tourist and you lose your kid in the middle of  the fucking park you key into his camera you just see a big hog in front of them jesus you have to  find him quick yeah you know look for the black guy you know they're not really the pedophiles but  they have the big dick so take with you they tried something sort of like this with that uh  microsoft mp3 player the zune because like their whole tag was welcome to the social and i think 
[01:53:30]  what they could what you could do with a zune is if you had some music uh on it and you were close to  someone else you could share your libraries together i remember reading about that and that kind of just  didn't go anywhere apple has that with their uh you can do that with apple with the uh with the uh the  lab the fucking right i don't like the idea of sharing my fucking connection no man i don't want to share my  pictures location picture like any of that shit is but if you're not an event that's where this  would be so yeah i could see shit like that you're in an event you're you're with a group of people 
[01:54:00]  you're all linked up together and then you go your separate ways or if you're in some dumb tourist area  like times square which is just horrible it would make that more interesting i would just fill up my  phone with dick pictures and just walk around all day long waiting to wait to link in to fill it up i would  just open my phone that's what i have on mine all my cock is there more info on the colored uh thing  online yet it's called color not colored that's a whole different yeah i've had it for years yes  puts up a little red flag they they're so scared map they've been working on this uh technology in 
[01:54:30]  silicon valley yeah so scared that they put they put paper up on all the windows of the place that is  uh working on this technology very mysterious don't want anyone looking looking in oh and this guy  people that work on it this guy's a rock star in the industry and uh doesn't didn't even really  know computers at all and and he makes a fucking fortune yeah if i heard it correctly 800 million  for his either an idea or a company and then he made 80 on the second one wow wow this is his third  big idea i'm working on an app that i think everybody's gonna go nuts for okay yeah yeah what is 
[01:55:00]  it you don't want to give it away i'll give away part of it all right it's where you push a button  and everybody in the same group has like a picture of me and you can put me anywhere you want like  waldo it's like a color formist but fear  can you change it to other people or is it always just you no it's always me okay but you put me but  i'm always in the same pose the pose is like this kind of like i'm smiling so you can put me in all 
[01:55:30]  kinds of funny places i like it tell me when it's available i'll avoid it someone answering the  phones today or oh same person as usual what is he doing uh oh who's answering the phones you rock  get on mic oh boy uh that is troy what did he do wrong troy quando they want to know why you're  not answering the phones i'm busy hang on hang on a second i was answering i was just about to answer 
[01:56:00]  that's good how come you didn't answer how come you didn't answer sooner it was like  how long was it ringing for i don't know it's your job are we talking about one lousy phone call this is  great i see more ringing that's why i'm asking it's ringing i was hoping to be honest with you  that someone else had a little more info on this color thing because it it piqued my interest i have  to look into it i like i like knowing what apps are out there once they figure out how to capture a  memory or a thought and make it into it like once i could think pink elephant all of a sudden uh 
[01:56:30]  it's just it's so tempting he's sitting right there is why  and we're all gonna be naked that's true if our thoughts are just out there that will happen  eventually though we're all gonna be on one thought right but you'll you'll yeah you'll try  not to think about certain things while you're like uploading something from your brain oh and  then it would you think about it and all of a sudden it would be there it's that's bad for the  people that are like whatever with this color app yeah mardi gras thank you flying oh mardi gras would 
[01:57:00]  be good right right hellfish on twitter of course imagine you're at mardi gras and you got this  well they'll probably have a thing where they have to get in trouble for nudity like they do you  know they'll give you a shit for having nudity or something i'm sure no nakedness i'm sure right  there on bourbon street just fucking sharing your tit and pussy and ass pictures with your pals that  color app says it owns your photos you will not own the rights to them it's like everything else  they don't really do you really think you own your facebook photos when you upload them to your 
[01:57:30]  wall no you know other people can just take them read the privacy statements the things are 20 pages  long well that's why you don't read them i just didn't agree that's why you don't own your photos  anymore facebook owns them any place that you upload a photo to guaranteed there is some there is some  text somewhere on that page that that says that you do not own those photos wow i would love to  do that someday i guess because it's already on your phone you're just sharing it but you're putting 
[01:58:00]  it on their server servers that they own they own it they own that copy they don't own the rights to  the entire yeah they probably don't own the rights to the photo itself well or else they'd be able to  i think what they mean is they own it so they could do whatever the fuck yeah they could do whatever  they want well meaning control control their content right well i mean what you need to do because  everyone is everyone is putting their lives online yeah you need to have complete control of  it facebook twitter any of these places could just yank your shit at any moment's notice and then you 
[01:58:30]  lose everything well like yeah there's a good business opportunity for somebody out there where  you literally own your shit online like it's a little piece of real estate for just you and you  don't really just a website i yeah it is put no you're yeah it is because you can put things up  there with not with impunity it's got to be within the laws of the land but you know i don't like the  idea of people being able to take down because they deem it offensive yeah you're you're right and i  but i was thinking that i guess what i was thinking is most people can't really afford a website a real 
[01:59:00]  website you know what i mean so yeah you're right yeah but i mean the business opportunity is to make  it affordable i guess like a social network type thing where you know this is my area and if i want to  fucking put nudity or just hardcore shit on there tough shit it's my area officially you don't really  have that with all these social networking sites i was talking to someone over the weekend they got  their whole facebook page just yanked for for just nonsense do you know the problem though that that  would be people would be complaining all the time this company is has this on their fucking uh server 
[01:59:30]  so that's how do you do that i guess is what i'm asking youtube is notorious for pulling shit off  based on political ideology um things that should be covered by just freedom of speech they call it hate  speech all the time they they yanked that bullying uh video that went viral so it went viral other  places because youtube yanked all the copies you know but meanwhile he's fucking fat kid yeah that  body slammed the that got yanked fuck yeah i don't know if it's back up now but youtube was yanking all  copies of that and then uh some massive sites picked up that video like um i don't know like huffington 
[02:00:00]  post and i'm sure drudge and all that they had it they had to get another version from another website  they couldn't use the youtube version it really is fucked up which obviously is the go-to site for  videos but they said fuck that and they yanked they yanked it they might be up there now but when it was  really hot and everybody was looking for it they started yanking uh taking the copies down i've seen  links to youtube videos that show um they might show certain people in a bad light doing some illegal 
[02:00:30]  activities or something like that and then they just get pulled off and and uh called like um it  violated their their hate fucking speech but then wasn't the chinese guy cut in half wasn't that a  youtube video no i wasn't no that was gore didn't allow fucking we did we did see some recently that  was just over the top horrific i'm trying to remember and it wasn't live video that one was  lively but yeah i'm thinking of something else but then they allow these fucking uh these fucking uh  i know religious freedom gets dicey but they allow these fucking imams yep these muslims to go on 
[02:01:00]  there and fucking look for you and that's hate speech but let me those videos ain't going away  let me say hi to jeff in north carolina i'm still obsessed with this color app you have the color  app jeff uh no do you prefer jeff or jeffykins i'm not even sure if it's whatever you like i'm not  even sure it's out yet it's out it is out but look the bad thing about it is because just on regular  people's facebook pages they take a thousand pictures of the same thing so in that i imagine you  just get flooded with crap i'm sure but you just scroll through it just like your twitter feed and 
[02:01:30]  you can quickly just grow i'm sure there are some yeah bad sides to the fucking thing but  anyway i'm out later all right well i i i thought that was kind of uh an interesting app see what it  is yeah i want to find out more about it here's what happens to me with my fucking eighth of a second  long attention span i go to uh the app store and uh i'm going i want to see what's new in apps today  so i'll i'll go and it'll say it'll go upload uh uh update um nine of your apps and i'm like oh 
[02:02:00]  fuck i gotta update and then by the time i'm done updating i forgot that i went to the app store to  look for new apps and then just uh two days later repeat i just get way too confused it's just too  many it yeah you got you got to do some sub searches and you can't browse within the app store  you need to know what you want you at least gotta have some fucking line on what i absolutely agree  what category yeah like you have to just do like a search search a search search a search a search 
[02:02:30]  yeah it's like you're punching like you're looking for certain apps you're punching eight y-o  nothing comes up  i'm calling you a pedo  oh god speaking of pedos the lead store next door  wow yes i've been um this story's creepy it's the best segue by the way  push-up bras and bathing suits are certainly not unusual or shocking except when they're made 
[02:03:00]  for little girls i mean they don't need push-up bras  yes they do they got no tits exactly it's the latest shopper from abercrombie and fitch  long known for pushing the envelope when it comes to sexuality and tight envelope  these push-up tops are made for girls as young as seven  well many express the six-year-olds don't have tits either a local professor says this kind of thing  is actually dangerous what it gets young girls to think about themselves in sexual ways before 
[02:03:30]  that it's developmentally appropriate and she adds the potentially negative psychological  effects are not limited to the young girls it sends out really bad signals to adult men  about the approach about young girls being appropriate sexual objects objects of sexual  desire for young men regarding sending a message a and f removed the words push-up from their website  but the padded tops are still there by the way any pedophile who really wants to 
[02:04:00]  to fuck little girls doesn't want them to have tits anyway yeah like that that's what the the  critics are missing he's like if you're getting ones that push up tits and make them look like tits  you're actually deterring pedos ew that's disgusting pedos like the fact that they're flat-chested they  don't want to grow with tits i was thinking this is probably for young fat girls who was walking around  you just go ew look at that young fat girl but you put her in a push-up bra now she's got cleavage now  she just looks like a midget um abercrombie that's good luck abercrombie and fitch uh they hate fat 
[02:04:30]  people mm-hmm well this push-up i'm nowhere near fat i can't get into any of their fucking clothes now  you have to be like uh you have to be shaped like you have to have a swimmer's body like a  you do you have a great body no not even close that's so creepy you have a great body he's ruined  my life this jim martin because then people see me like jeez you let yourself go no this is how i  always was in a day right jimmy made it way better than it was sometimes when you reach for something 
[02:05:00]  on that table your shirt will lift up a little bit and the stomach muscles shows yeah you don't need to  add muscle to that yeah because that'll happen at signings i'll reach for something like but dude  you got a gut i'm like yeah i always had a gut jimmy started that v shit i never had a v in my life  not even close you fucking asshole look at jimmy's dipping his sandwich in his chili  i'm very hungry i see that's that you don't dip you did i dip sometimes but i ate my sandwich 
[02:05:30]  your sandwich and the chili and the soup i'm just kind of i didn't eat much this weekend at all  i just had a very low eating good boy i was depressed i'm better now but i was depressed  was there a problem i don't yeah something we can help you with i was gonna say i don't remember  asking you about this but i don't know i want to offer it though because people think i'm so cool  and perfect that i have a person in here yeah your twitter feed was a little weird this weekend  i'll be honest really yeah jimmy seemed a little sad on his twitter my moments yeah you looked a 
[02:06:00]  little sad this oh i'm okay though everything all right oh yeah much better you're a big star  yeah i finally squeezed a load out yesterday it was marvelous all the depression went away what was  your line about sleeping you felt like you were a uh a junkie yeah you said that right yeah i was  sleeping all day junkie hours yeah it was a weird week though keeping junky outside yeah it wasn't  warm enough it was just fucking shitty so you'd sleep um so abercrombie fitch doesn't like the fat  person yeah yeah they don't like fat people but apparently they like uh seven-year-olds to have 
[02:06:30]  titties can i see this push-up bra i've never seen this shit in action yeah let's see go to they're  not calling him push-up anymore though that's what the story said but why they're just calling him  like triangle fucking what what the fuck is uh the reasoning behind this um to i know a lot of  parents they wouldn't they wouldn't get this for their really it's a huge seller for an eight-year-old  they're making huge amounts of money off of these things that's how people are some some 
[02:07:00]  women like dressing their girls up like sluts that's how the fucking little miss perfect  content contest is on the air so you think this is based on that um i don't know that's part of  that shit on but i think there's a girls used they used to just be little fucking girls sugar and  spice and everything nice what the hell are they doing well everything has to be sexualized  yeah you want some make it look like you got pecs yeah i would love a push-up bra no i was just  gonna say yeah they changed it uh to triangle like aunt said but yeah they also there was some articles 
[02:07:30]  coming out that uh technically by the sizes that they were selling they weren't selling it to seven  year olds it was eleven year olds right see now don't be crazy seven's just silly to put a push-up bra so  they'll have tits yeah eleven on the other hand on the other hand that makes sense it's two digits in  their fucking uh age give me a break well oh seven all right that way too 
[02:08:00]  got it there's there's something going on i'm sorry look at this horrible camera work on that look  at the tv the bottom half of the guy's face msnbc is the worst take your fucking sign off the bottom of  the tv the guy was talking and you couldn't even see his mouth moving god are they shitheads tv people  well you got uh advertisement you got the headline news scrolling you got morning joe graphics what  time it is this the channel yeah they need march 28th we all know what fucking date it is 
[02:08:30]  and we all know what time it is we have iphones you don't need the fucking clock  you know what time it is oh it drives me nuts i know you get very upset with that because it's  fucking it's lazy i agree with you because now they take it away so her tit show now it's back  the split screen with her and fucking the other broad i think what it's based on they're trying  to make it look like websites because because tv just don't look so old there is uh something they 
[02:09:00]  were doing on um channel 11 early this morning when i was watching or late last night i have no idea  when or when or where i was uh they do something called the 11 at 10 or the 10 at 11 it would all  depend on what time it was there's there's 10 stories that are lined up on the bottom and they  look exactly like apps right and they have the circle with the one in the corner circle two right  and the news story with a little picture right and they run really quick through all those top stories 
[02:09:30]  to let you know everything that's happening and it they are trying so hard to make it look  like a computer like an iphone like any kind of but we bitched these people if they're finally  updating their shit and trying to like uh bring it to the current time then you know good for them  yeah well no i gotta give a little credit because it's cool but they're so behind and they don't  really i don't know we said a year ago that the tv's starting to look old especially the news so if  they're trying new things right on but if they're piling 8 000 graphics on top of each other so you  can't even see the screen well cnbc that's that's all finances so they're fucking horrendous they 
[02:10:00]  gotta shove a lot they need to roll those stock uh prices it's fucking ridiculous you don't need  all that if you want to know what apple is trading at you can just look on your phone but they don't  want you to look on the phone look at my face if i'm biting my lip until it bleeds you know it's down  exactly they don't want you looking on your phone though jimmy they want you to look right  no they want you looking there they want you to wait for your stock to to fly by i used to sit  in gary wall's office instead of having meetings remember we'd watch these tickers for hours i 
[02:10:30]  learned so much about stocks from that guy i know unfortunately it didn't work out in the  end with the citadel but he's responsible he taught us a lot of shit we didn't we didn't know much  about it until that now i may have a stock tip soon by the way oh a good one yeah yep  coke's going into cans i've been fucking that movie tom lee jones black coke stumpy it's going  in the cans ty cobb oh boy did he have some fucking words did he have some words about sweet  georgia brown sweet georgia brown yeah yeah remember that uh no i don't oh boy i think i think it's 
[02:11:00]  racist speaking of racism a whoopee and the donald gotten a little sparring match over obama  and the birth certificate uh because uh trump wants to see the birth certificate of obama to make sure he's  born a u.s citizen and is eligible to be president that's a fair thing to want he's the official uh  king of the birther movement now yeah is he really yeah he knocked out the main guy now whoopee  said that asking for it is racist see it's like stop playing that fucking race card 
[02:11:30]  it's ridiculous and yeah you know what put it on every website everywhere just put it on every  government website here's his birth certificate here you're happy but they won't show the goddamn  thing because it's i think he probably wasn't born there it's going to come out after they're not  going to have the president he was born in indonesia and and went to hawaii and uh do you think he was  uh absolutely no why the fuck wouldn't they just show it and get it over with i don't know i think 
[02:12:00]  they should it is suspicious i'll be honest with you the fucking and look it's in the cons isn't it in  the constitution that that's what you have so then you have a whole constitutional issue of  is anything he does as president valid because constitutionally he was not been right and that's  not racist to say if any other president if there have been questions about where he was born they  should show it too that to me that's an absolute no-brainer the public has the right when you're 
[02:12:30]  the president to see every fucking aspect of your life where is it yeah why don't they show it it's a  weird one because there's there's enough uh there's there's enough people talking about where  you can just shut up and then you'll hear people go they did show it he did make sure he produced it  well i've never seen it and i've looked a lot of places to try to find this thing where is it  where the fuck is it is this the view where they were yelling at each other yeah can we see it  yeah i got a little sound let me see that sweetie come on put some sound  sounds the worst on the computer now start it can't hear it sam what are we what are we not 
[02:13:00]  listening i don't care it's four minutes in the last 30 years i mean we have so this is not because  it's nothing new this has been going on so you're saying you would come in and stop that  practice it's never been as bad as it is now we've never had a trillion six in deficits it was  as bad when george bush left office and he was the one who left this who left this excuse me  i'm a republican george bush he gave us obama i'm not a big fan of george bush i'm not a fan of 
[02:13:30]  obama who gave who i know whoopi because we all went over if you did if you did let me just say  if you did be and she likes me she even put me in a movie i was just gonna say she put me in a  movie right a long time ago how much did i judge nothing like they didn't even talk about it  would you say you're fired to him if you did beat him in the general election i don't want to  trivialize it you know we have this show that turned out to be such a surprise that's why i'm  sitting here partially because what the did she that is that elizabeth hasselbeck that yeah she's 
[02:14:00]  the worst she is the worst she interrupted for that her and whoopi are are horrid and who's worse  she's worse she's worse please say she's worse i know whoopi's black and i'll have a no no it doesn't  matter that she's black but she will be with hasselbeck is the worst i know you agree with her point  of you more than whoopi but she is she's an idiot she's an embarrassment that's why they let her  that's why they have her by the way yeah because they need the idiotic other side of it instead of 
[02:14:30]  a conservative like because joy is smart whoopi's not dumb whoopi's smart but what i believe i see  whoopi as being a racist well whoopi's blackness gets in she's playing that race card she's hyper i  don't think she's a racial she's a racist she doesn't hate white people no but her blackness gets in the  way she's a comic she should be a comic first man she's hypersensitive no i'm gonna i'm gonna say  hard is a comic first and that's why i don't mind jimmy i'm calling her a racist because if a white  person's hypersensitive they're racist there's no fucking there's no middle ground if you say  anything uh derogatory about blacks and you're white you're a racist so if she's fucking pulling 
[02:15:00]  the race card out i'm gonna call her no no but i don't agree with that one it's white people either  so i'm not i'm not gonna pin her to the same definition when i don't agree with it the other  way but i hasselbeck is just a fucking i mean look i don't agree with what would be where she's gonna go  with this but at least she's having a real discussion uh this fucking idiot would you say  you're fired shut up more importantly i don't i don't think donald trump has a chance in hell to  win this thing he doesn't but no one says no one even says that because it's so far out it's a goof 
[02:15:30]  why don't you say this is a goof right you're having fun with this he's right he's right to want to see  the birth of you though sure how much should i judge nothing like they say in the government  if you're taking obama though would you say you're fired to him if you did beat him in the general  election i don't want to trivialize it you know we have this show that turned out to be such a  successor maybe that's why i'm sitting here partially because people have gotten to know 
[02:16:00]  you recently said about president obama i'm going to quote you he grew up and nobody knew him nobody  knows who he is until later in his life the whole thing is very strange what are you driving at there  are you a birther donald let me just say that i was a really good student at the best school i'm  not like a smart guy okay they make these birthers into the worst it is why doesn't he show his birth  certificate i think he's probably because i have to and everybody else has to write i'm sure why  excuse me why no hold on two seconds i really believe did fucking whoopie actually say why should 
[02:16:30]  he have to she did yes because you're the president of the united states and constitutionally  you have to prove that you were an american citizen dummy yeah i agree with you yeah i  completely agree with you i agree especially because a lot of people are talking about if it  was a dumb little tiny thing she's saying because he's black would she be defending him because he's  bush she's defending him because he's black right right i definitely agree with you on this one  oh sorry why look she's smiling why doesn't he show his birth certificate and you know what i wish he 
[02:17:00]  would because i think it's a terrible pale that's hanging over him he should show his birth certificate the  other thing if you go back to my first grade my kindergarten people remember me nobody from  those early years that's not true we have pictures of him okay show me a picture there are kids in  hawaii there are people in hawaii i've seen 14 year olds i've seen 13 but i haven't seen early  pictures exactly but more importantly why doesn't he and and you know what i think he probably was but 
[02:17:30]  the word probably will be you know why you have to defend himself against you know what against  because if you're going to be the president of the united states it says very profoundly that you  You have to be born in this country.  But did any of the president do that today?  Did George Bush not be...  They don't even know how to fucking let one person talk. 
[02:18:00]  Because they like Obama because he's been on the show a couple of times.  Go back a little bit.  They like him a lot because he's been on the show.  He absolutely...  If somebody demanded to see George Bush's birthday, there was no question...  Yeah, there was no question.  That he was born here.  That's why.  Or Clinton.  There was no question.  If there was, they would have probably produced their birth certificates.  FDR born in Canada.  Why is this guy saying this?  Was he?  Was that ever talked about?  I don't know.  Hold on a minute. 
[02:18:30]  I don't know.  Keep your fucking mind.  Wouldn't surprise me.  That's socialist.  Chris in Jersey.  What do you mean FDR was born in Canada, sir?  What's up?  He was born there.  But he was born just over the border of the United States, and his family faked a birth  certificate.  Made him a U.S. citizen.  Okay.  Is this something that we know, or you just...  No, no.  It's true.  All right.  Let's say that's true.  They faked the birth certificate.  So people... 
[02:19:00]  Did the people question it, and they would just, oh, okay, he does a birth certificate?  There is no question.  You could run for president, and no one asks you, oh, can I see your birth certificate?  Right.  Like, people would run, and no one's, like, questioned their citizenship.  I never heard this FDR thing.  Yeah, I didn't either.  What part of Canada?  John McCain was born in Canada.  What part of Canada before you move on?  New Brunswick.  Where is that?  It's, like, above New York, I think.  Okay.  Wait, McCain was born where?  Panama.  In Panama.  I've heard that one. 
[02:19:30]  Was he?  I didn't know that.  I don't know.  Yeah, he was.  Is that one of our territories?  It's a territory.  What's that, sir?  I mean, it's not Wikipedia.  I'm not disbelieving you.  I just didn't know that.  Okay, well, then you know what?  McCain wouldn't be, uh...  Wait, wait, wait.  Was it a military base?  It was, but I mean, it's still...  All right, well, that's a merger.  If you're born on a military base...  Let's consider it a merger.  Oh, there you go.  All right.  Yeah, but Hawaii is still a territory.  They're not saying if it was born in Hawaii.  They're saying he was born in Indonesia.  Yeah, they're not saying Hawaii is wrong, sir.  No, they're saying he... 
[02:20:00]  What he's saying is they have a Hawaii birth certificate for Obama.  We haven't seen it.  If he was born in Hawaii, he's good to go, as we like to say.  All right.  But no one's seen the birth certificate.  All right, Chris, thank you, sir.  Let's listen to more Donald Trump getting these fucking hens all riled up like a fox just walked.  It's like he walked in through feed.  Yeah.  We backed it up so you could hear them all babbling at the same time.  And they've been on TV long enough to know that this can't be good for the viewers.  Go ahead.  Okay. 
[02:20:30]  He's an American citizen.  Because if you're going to be the president of the United States, it says very profoundly that you have to be born in this country.  But did any of your president do that?  Did George Bush show me the president?  The president said, why would he want the name of the name of the United States?  What the hell is that?  Holy shit.  What the fuck?  Do you know what it is?  They have fucking...  They have an extra hole and words just pop out of it.  It's a matter what you...  Damn, that was babble.  ...and words just falling out of their vaginas and their mouths at the same time. 
[02:21:00]  Endless.  Just endless babble.  How could they be defending the point that Donald is saying, let's see your birth certificate just to prove that you're an American citizen?  How do you argue that?  How do you fucking argue that by going, he shouldn't have to, even though that's really the only proof that he is an American citizen?  Let's say fuck it.  Whoopi said, why should he have to defend himself?  Well, because when you're in that position of power, that's a big one. 
[02:21:30]  Are you constitutionally allowed to be the president?  Yes.  That's a fair thing for people who want to say.  Where the fuck were you born?  And if he has it and goes, yeah, here it is, then everybody who criticized him looks like an asshole.  He can make everyone look stupid.  And he's not?  Stop.  Yeah, that would be really good for his side.  It'd be great.  Listen, Mike Wayne from TX on Twitter there says, FDR was born in Hyde Park.  This caller's a lying douchebag.  Where was FDR born, according to the website?  I never heard that.  I didn't either. 
[02:22:00]  I never heard that.  Fuck him.  Was he the one with the New Deal and taxation?  What was the New Deal?  I thought that was like Woodrow Wilson.  No, no, who's the one who did the fucking...  Oh, he was the other one.  Who's the one who did...  Roosevelt was a socialist asshole, yeah.  Yeah, he was.  And we got a, hey, idiots, his mother's a U.S. citizen.  He has a U.S. passport.  He is a U.S.A. citizen.  He absolutely is a citizen.  He is so Schwarzenegger.  Where were you born?  Yeah, Arnold Schwarzenegger is an American citizen.  Where were you born?  Don't try to argue the point that he's an American citizen. 
[02:22:30]  We know he is.  You dummy deflecting cunt.  Fuck, man.  People are stupid.  Just stupid.  Don't try to argue the point when the facts have not been put out there.  Here's the fact.  We've not seen his birth certificate.  Here's the fact.  He lived in Indonesia.  We don't know if he was born there.  That's the thing that's the mystery.  How about he produces a fact and makes us all look stupid?  Years after the fact.  All right.  Cocksucker.  Let's see some of these fucking... 
[02:23:00]  This is the rest of this.  Yeah, this is Donald Trump on the video.  In the hands.  Did George Bush show me everything?  The question is, why would he want this?  You know what I'm saying?  Probably he was.  No one has ever asked George Bush or said to George Bush, I'm sorry, is Hawaii not part  of the United States?  I'm guaranteeing George Bush.  And I'm not saying I was a fan of George Bush.  No, no.  You know that better than anybody.  But why are we...  But George Bush was born in this country.  That's right.  What is...  Isn't Hawaii still part of the United States?  Am I gone?  Do you question whether he was or not?  Can you pause this for one second? 
[02:23:30]  Why is Whoopi dressed like Groucho when he was being a doctor?  She has horrible clothes.  Whoopi, what are you doing?  I don't know, man.  Oh, shit.  That outfit's horrendous.  That's the craziest thing I have ever heard.  And Sherry Shepard...  What a Groucho impression.  Sherry Shepard belongs to my gym.  I've seen her once, and I've been a member of this gym for about two years.  Oh, really?  Tells you a lot.  And she walks around like a beach ball with legs.  She is the worst fucking figure I've ever seen on a woman in my life. 
[02:24:00]  Figure, yes.  Figure.  Figure.  Beautiful figure.  Let's get to the end of this clip.  Question.  Am I gone?  Do you question whether he was or not because he hasn't come forward with us?  I grew up in New York.  Wall Street was a big part.  I have seen fraud, and I have seen scandal, and I have seen things that a lot of people don't see.  I've seen people take a $100 bill and make it a million dollar bill.  We're going to have to pause.  Get to the point.  Okay, the point is, I can't rely on some newspaper that they show that...  In order to become president of the United States...  I want him to show his birth certificate. 
[02:24:30]  I want him to show his birth certificate.  There's something on that birth certificate that he doesn't like.  Oh, my God.  Oh, that's a terrible thing to say.  I'm telling you.  You ain't have a day.  Donnie, I love you.  I'm telling you.  I think that's the biggest pile of dog mess I've heard in ages.  Really?  Then show it.  Then show it.  Then show it.  It's not because he's black.  Let him show.  What?  It has nothing to do with it.  Because I've never heard nothing to do with it.  Any white president asked to be shown the birth certificate. 
[02:25:00]  There's never been a white president that was alleged to have been born in Indonesia.  There's no fucking allegations with a fucking mother, with a different father.  Who the fuck knows where they grew up?  Who knows where he was born?  Come on.  Enough people hated Bush.  Enough people hated Jimmy Carter, Reagan, any president you want to name.  Enough people hated them where if that allegation was possibly true, it would have been raised. 
[02:25:30]  You don't think Rush Limbaugh would have come up with a Bill Clinton doesn't have a birth certificate that shows he was born in this country if he could have?  Jimmy Carter was born in the Philippines.  Oh, yeah?  Yes, he was.  Look it up.  Is that where he learned his peanut farming craft?  Yes.  We're almost to the end of this fucking show.  Turn it racial, Whoopi.  Turn it fucking racial.  Stop it.  You think Barbara Walters smells like sauerkraut at this point in her life?  That just bad sauerkraut water? 
[02:26:00]  It's not fresh anymore, man.  It's not fresh.  It's an old hat.  Yeah.  All right, let's go.  The South and State of America, you know that he's American outside.  Are you saying that it just only lets people have doubt and it shouldn't be there?  Do you want to talk about The Apprentice?  It doesn't matter.  It's doing good.  The radio is doing good.  This is good.  I'll change that subject.  We have to pause.  We'll have more of this when we come back.  Yeah, thanks.  Trump is very good.  He's smooth, man.  With shutting them all up, yeah. 
[02:26:30]  But he touches, like, yeah, you put me in your movies.  Like, they all want to hate him, but then he has a way of, like, smoothing everything  all up.  But he does the hand thing.  To get his points out.  Where he's, like, up.  Where he puts his hand, like.  Oh, yeah.  Almost like he's putting.  Like, here, I'm talking.  Hold it, yeah.  Hold on.  Like, just one more second.  I'm talking.  Man.  Joe Cross is here?  Yeah.  We should take a break, then.  Yeah, we'll do that.  Joe Cross from Fat, Sick, and Nearly Dead, a documentary I saw and I liked.  I definitely liked it.  We'll talk to him next.  Anything else?  I love the same people that think that the World Trade Center was brought down by our 
[02:27:00]  own government.  Those same people can't fathom the thought that perhaps there's a fucking birth certificate  that isn't quite kosher.  That is unfathomable.  Great point.  Crazy.  Great point.  But the government brought down all the buildings and planes and everything.  Great point.  People are dumb.  They should have a Geraldo special with the birth certificate.  It's a thermite birth certificate.  I've seen it.  He's in the building today, that dope.  Geraldo?  No.  Jesse?  Yeah.  Oh, shit. 
[02:27:30]  Jesse's back?  He's doing a sports show, I hear?  No, he's not.  Somebody said that.  Oh, my God.  Why won't he do our show again?  Because he hates my guts.  Oh, boy.  That's fine.  He does TV where he hates the people.  Come on in and show your brains.  Maybe because you're despicable.  Excellent plug for my CD.  But, yeah, I honestly don't give a fuck if he does the show or not.  Yes.  I could care less either way.  Fuck him.  What are we going to do?  And let me tell you another thing.  He's avoiding us.  Of course he is.  Wait, what's this? 
[02:28:00]  That's the birth certificate.  Oh, okay.  Well, why are we saying that he didn't show it if he did?  Oh, it's online.  It's got to be fucking real.  I can make that.  That's not true.  I can make that.  It's great.  Look at that.  It's perfect.  Look how nice it is.  It's too big.  It looks like it was printed yesterday.  Yeah.  No, and what I was saying, there's something to it, though.  Well, Geraldo does a big special with the unveiling of the birth certificate.  Yeah.  Yeah, yeah.  The unveiling.  Make it a whole hour special.  Well, that's it.  Birthplace.  He is male.  Honolulu.  He's male, and he's Honolulu. 
[02:28:30]  Why is his certificate number blocked out?  What is his religion?  It's private.  Is it?  It's private.  Yeah, but that's...  Nothing's private.  But the number is the most important part of that.  Anyone can print this up.  Look at the seal.  But at least if you have a number, you can match it up with other numbers.  This is dumb.  It's a Google image.  Go to that thing with the magnifying glass.  Hold on real quick before we bring...  What does that say?  Are they...  Oh, boy.  There it is.  Read it and weep.  Read it and weep.  But anyone could have made that. 
[02:29:00]  You need the number.  I'm not trusting that.  Until the White House puts it out there, I'm not trusting online shit.  What did Obama say about this?  Nothing.  He won't acknowledge it.  And his excuse, I think, through three levels of other people is,  we're not going to fucking give any credence to any of that.  The president has more important things to worry about than trying to prove things that are blah-de-blah-blah.  He says certification of live birth on top.  I'm insulted.  He probably is insulted that people are saying that. 
[02:29:30]  You know, I'm insulted.  If you ask him, I bet you he would say something like that.  I'm insulted of his actions.  Why don't we break?  Because Joe Cross is just sitting there.  I don't know what I'm saying.  Hold on.  Aunt Anthony was saying something.  I don't know.  Oh, lady.  Aunt Anthony.  Aunt Anthony.  I'm insulted by his actions.  I showed him.  I've got another one.  This is a better version right here.  This one has a certificate number.  It's 52.  Oh, why does that look like green crayon?  No.  No, that's official.  It says official.  It says official.  O-F-F-I-S-H-A-L. 
[02:30:00]  It does say Hawaii on it.  That's where...  Dude, that's bullshit.  That's not a real birth certificate.  Maybe you're right.  And Joe Cross is still in our office.  All right.  He's probably going to eat donuts any moment.  Yeah, you've got to get him in before he breaks down.  Yeah, he's going to break down.  We'll have Joe Cross from Fat, Sick, and Nearly Dead next.  Stay there.  And now, 88 seconds of former Minnesota governor, professional wrestler, and Navy SEAL, Jesse  Ventura, talking crazy.  And go. 
[02:30:30]  Were they testing out HAARP, and it created this tsunami that later killed hundreds and  thousands of people?  Ah!  They have such power.  Our president goes to it, and our president has to sign a no-talk thing.  And the real guy is this character called Maurice Strong.  That's the big point.  What if it is?  No.  No.  No.  It shows how they can shoot these things down to masses of people and literally affect your 
[02:31:00]  emotions with them.  They can cause you anxiety.  They can cause you fear.  And that was on the night that Jesus Christ supposedly rose from the dead.  Both.  Both.  Both.  Yep.  With this satellite, if they want to, they can follow you and know right where you're at.  It's eye-opening.  I don't do computers.  I'm computer illiterate, happily.  Probably.  But trust me, you know, I can do you in and not think twice about it.  Oswald couldn't make the shots.  You know that as well as I do. 
[02:31:30]  This thing's set up on the same frequency as the human brain.  Do you think that's by happenstance or by design?  Why would everything have to be locked up in national security for 50 years?  That's because you're not seeing the real medical evidence.  Could that be part of it, that they're heating up the ionosphere up there by using this thing?  Ford changed where the bullet hit.  They put him in the MRI and the machine went ballistic.  You know why?  Five chips in his body.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  That was 88 seconds of former Minnesota governor, professional wrestler, and Navy SEAL Jesse Ventura talking crazy. 
[02:32:00]  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  On the Opie and Anthony Show.  The virus.  Serious.  Serious.  You're listening to Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony.  Hey, let's get Joe Cross in here.  Roland loves this guy, by the way.  Roland turned me on to the movie Fat, Sick, and Nearly Dead.  What's up, Joe?  Hey, guys.  How you doing?  Pretty good.  Really?  I saw the movie, and I really, really liked it, sir. 
[02:32:30]  Thanks, mate.  And it's available on DVD next month, but it's going to be in theaters, isn't it?  Yeah, we're in theaters from Friday in New York.  Friday.  Okay.  Nice.  I was telling these guys, you were kind of an out-of-shape guy from Australia, right?  Yeah, if you call round out-of-shape.  And the first thing I noticed right off the bat, because I saw the movie, obviously you  filmed that a while ago, you kept the weight off.  So congratulations on that, because that's the toughest thing.  A lot of people could lose the weight, and then they get down to an ideal weight and decide,  oh, I don't have to worry about dieting anymore, and they get right back to where they were. 
[02:33:00]  Yeah, I know.  It's a real problem.  I mean, losing weight fast.  You know how you hear people say that it's dangerous to lose weight fast?  Yeah.  It's actually not dangerous losing it.  It's dangerous putting it back on fast.  Back afterwards.  How much weight are you right now?  I'm around 230.  I got down to 220 was my low.  Okay.  I started out at 310.  310.  Got to 220.  Sure.  Now plateaued around 230.  And 230 is a good way you want to live your life.  When you were at 310, were you making excuses for yourself, like, oh, I just can't lose  the weight?  Because it seems to me a lot of people make excuses instead of just going, look, I obviously 
[02:33:30]  have to eat less than I'm eating.  I think, well, for starters, the excuse is I never tuck my shirt in to start with.  So you come up with all sorts of tricks.  You'll look good.  Right?  And, you know, if you might remember, you know, I know, like the fashion trends have  changed in the last 10 years.  People don't tuck their shirt in so much.  And I reckon that's because of the weight gain stuff.  The weight problem.  Yeah.  It's also uncomfortable, too.  Yeah.  But you start making excuses.  I think one of the things I learned as I drove across your great country was that I 
[02:34:00]  never met anyone who needed to be told they were overweight.  I mean, people know.  Well, let's get into it a little bit then.  So you're 310 in Australia and you get this idea, I'm going to come to America and juice  for 60 days.  Yeah.  Where did you get the idea for the juicing part to begin with?  Well, the first thing was, I think we've got to add in that I was 310 and taking prescription  medication night and day for eight years.  For what?  I would assume diabetes?  No, no.  I had this thing called chronic urticaria.  Oh, that's right. 
[02:34:30]  It was in the movie.  Andioedema, which is like a rash.  It's like chronic hives.  So any time I had any pressure or any touching on me, my body would swell up and I'd get welts  and it was very painful.  Where were they?  Hive?  Everywhere.  Wherever I was touched.  So you would scratch somewhere and be like, ah, hives.  Yeah.  Well, someone who'd shake my hand really, you know, I've got the softest hands of any 45-year-old.  I know, because I wasn't able to do anything with them.  Oh, great.  And, you know, I'm talking sex, anything, you actually had pressure.  Damn.  Hives on the penis?  All sorts of different ways of everything.  And what did the medication do?  Actually, believe it or not, in your penis, there's no things called mast cells. 
[02:35:00]  Right.  So that's probably one of the one areas that I never...  That was safe?  It never swelled up, unfortunately.  Ah.  So you just told everyone...  Yeah, that would have been...  So you just told everyone to touch your penis and you'll be away.  Yeah, I was right.  You know, shaking heads with people.  It was fine.  So what were some of the side effects from the medication?  Well, side effects from long-term prednisone are pretty bleak.  Actually, you know, you can get osteoporosis, your bones start...  Makes your face blow up weird.  You can get a thing called hunchback, where you get these big things going on your back.  Round face, or they call it moon face.  Yeah, yeah.  And that's not pretty. 
[02:35:30]  No, no.  Wow.  So you said, I've got to do something.  I've got to do something.  Who turned you on to the juice thing?  Well, the idea about the juicing, sort of...  The first step was that I kind of worked out, after trying almost everything, I went to  the best specialist in the world.  I went to, you know, I went to every...  I turned over every leaf.  I tried everything.  But the one thing that I didn't want to have to change was my diet, because I love my burgers.  I love my pizza.  I love my milkshakes.  I love my beer.  And I didn't want to have to sort of face up to the reality that, hey, maybe this is 
[02:36:00]  because of me.  So I just said, you know what?  I've turned my back on Mother Nature for 10 years, 20 years.  And what would happen if I turned towards her and ran to her full pelt?  In other words, what would happen if I went to only a plant-based diet, which is like fruits,  vegetables, nuts, beans, seeds, legumes, all that sort of stuff that's made by the sun,  the earth, and water?  What would happen?  And then I thought, well, to supercharge this up, I'm going to juice it to begin with.  I'm going to actually put it in a liquid form. 
[02:36:30]  Why?  Because you can get more of it into your system.  I don't know if you've seen, like, if you actually take a juice, you can drink that,  like, in, like, a minute, whereas to eat all of that might take 20 minutes.  Well, I go to a juice store, and it's amazing how much stuff they put in the juicer just  to get your drink.  Yeah.  Like you said.  It's like a whole bunch of stuff, and you get a little juice out of it.  Without even thinking, they put two or three massive carrots in, and it's gone.  Like you said, that would take an hour to eat.  Yeah, that's right.  And so, I mean, my plan was, hey, I'm going to live on this food until I'm off my medication. 
[02:37:00]  That was the plan, and it took five months, 60 days of juicing, and three months of eating  the stuff only.  But you went to, but you came to America to film it for the documentary.  Well, I'll tell you why I came to America, is because I, I mean, I'd never made a movie  before.  I'd never had a camera on me, and I came from the world of investment, and finance, and  banking, and, you know, making bets on other people in their businesses, like investing  VC, venture capital world.  And I thought, you know, if I make this movie in Australia, Australians are going to watch 
[02:37:30]  it, but Americans, they're not real, they're not real big on watching stuff in other people's  countries.  Whereas, in Australia, we're like the 50-50 first state.  We watch everything that you guys make.  So I figured I could kill two birds with one stone if I came here.  God damn, he knows we're, he knows we're all self-centered over here, and we're like,  ah, yeah, that comes from there, fuck it.  And we'll get on public television and leave me alone.  Didn't, uh, bad boy Bubby come from Australia?  Yeah, I think so.  You know bad boy Bubby?  That was great.  See, we watch your stuff. 
[02:38:00]  You might want to look that up after the interview.  The other big problem with driving across Australia is, versus driving across America,  we've got no one in the middle of that country.  Oh, right, right.  So city to city.  It would have been pretty boring, right?  Just Joe out there in the middle of that juice and up a green juice.  What's the longest distance in Australia between, like, how far are you driving in Australia  in the middle of it before you see people?  Oh, there's a couple, you can go like a day and a half.  Oh, with nobody.  I mean, you'll see some gas stations, but you won't, you know, it's pretty barren out  in the middle of it.  But from big city to big city, to drive like, it isn't like from driving from New York to  Philly, let's say. 
[02:38:30]  Oh, no, no.  Yeah, you got a long haul.  Where do the gas station people live?  Yeah, exactly.  If the gas stations are in the middle of nowhere, where do those people live?  I mean, how do they get their food?  Well, the problem, I mean, I've got a bit of a rule that you don't, you shouldn't get  your food for your body, your energy for your body, where you get your energy for your  car.  Because I don't know about you guys, but I've never seen good food in a gas station.  Yeah, no.  Nothing you can juice in there.  But it's delicious, though.  It's good stuff in those gas stations.  Well, that's what these truck drivers, these poor blokes who are driving all their produce  around the country.  I mean, there's thousands of these guys out there driving trucks, and they're not allowed 
[02:39:00]  to take their rigs into towns to get good food.  So the only place they can get their food is at truck stops.  So, 60 Days in America, that's what the film's about, fat, sick, and nearly dead.  And what I really liked about the film, and it was a nice twist, you met that truck driver  at the truck stop.  Yeah, great guy.  And you talked to him about, because you're trying to educate people as you're trying  to get yourself in better shape.  And you look at this guy, he's like, he's not going to listen to Joe, he's a truck driver,  he means well, but within a week, he's going to just give up on this shit. 
[02:39:30]  And wow, wow, this guy listened to you and took it all the way.  Oh, yeah?  Well, I guess I found, I'm done about you boys, I'm sure you'd agree with me, that telling  people what to do doesn't work.  Right.  I mean, I reckon we're sick of being told what to do, whether it's your husband, your  wife, your boyfriend, your girlfriend, your parents, your boss, or even the government.  We're tired of being told what to do.  Yes.  So my father, when I was a little boy, he said, Joe, you want to get something done, you've  got to lead by example.  You've got to get out there and do it.  And if you do the right thing, surprise, surprise, people might just follow. 
[02:40:00]  Then he played a didgeridoo.  Yeah.  I just, afterwards, it wasn't like that, you'd expect that.  So when I got over here to America, the last thing I wanted to do was to tell anybody what  to do.  So I'd say, you know what, I'm going to do like the Forrest Gump thing.  I'm going to go across the country like he, when he ran, you know how people just started  following?  Yeah.  So I thought, what if I go with my juicer and a truck full of fruits and vegetables?  Will people follow?  I did the Forrest Gump thing too.  I came on somebody's robe and then I banged a girl who had AIDS. 
[02:40:30]  I knew you.  I knew he was going there.  You were going there?  I knew he was going there.  Oh, Jimmy.  Well, I'll just say one thing.  When you're drinking juice for 60 days, the last thing you feel like is sex.  Oh, really?  I've got to tell you, it's one of the big things that, and you think about it, it's kind of  normal in that the old days when there were famines on, that wasn't a good time to procreate.  So for men, when you actually go on a long-term reducing calories and only taking on just 
[02:41:00]  juice, it's surprising, like Mr. Happy doesn't work.  But wow, that's fucked up.  Your energy had to suck.  The whole time I'm watching the movie, I'm thinking his energy's got to be really low  because you've got not much protein going in.  The complete opposite.  My energy.  But I don't get that.  Well, it's a funny thing.  If you think about what actually happens is, is that in order to function, we need energy.  Right, right, right.  All right.  So the body works in a kind of a weird and mysterious way.  Muscle and fat are the energy supply storage system we have in the human body. 
[02:41:30]  I mean, the human body is made up of five things, right?  Bones, organs, muscle, fat, and blood.  That's it.  You've got control over two of them.  You can control and regulate the size of your muscles and how much fat you've got on your  body.  And you see, today, I look at people, I don't see fat people.  You know what I see?  I see people walking around with lots of excess energy.  It's like a storage system.  It's like a refrigerator.  They've got it and they're carrying it around with them.  So if you don't put food into your mouth.  You call it Fukushima Nagel. 
[02:42:00]  If you don't consume this energy, the body needs energy.  So it's going to go to the storage system.  Now, when you actually don't have to break down all of that food you're putting in, you  actually have more energy.  Because when you eat a meal, about 25% of the energy you actually consume in that meal is  being used to break it down.  I mean, you guys ever worked out why you can't go for a run around Central Park and  eat?  You know why you can't run and eat, like when you're actually running?  Because all your blood is in your extremities of the muscles making the muscles move.  It's gone from the digestive system.  So when you eat, all that blood, everything gets drawn down in the digestive system to 
[02:42:30]  break down the food.  You have a big steak.  I mean, that's going to take maybe, you know, five, six hours to break down.  Yeah, a while.  So when you're not eating and all you're doing is drinking really rich micronutrient  phytochemicals, tens of thousands of these amazing little chemicals and compounds that  really what your body needs to feed all of those cells, then when you do that without  having anything of any rubbish or fiber, and I'm not going to say fiber is a bad word,  but just for a short period of time, your energy goes through the roof. 
[02:43:00]  Now, it does take about 72 hours to break through.  Let me ask you a question, too, because I always get, I like to crunch when I eat.  I like, I need pretzels.  I need something to crunch.  Right.  I know you have to get over that, but don't you get nauseous without eating?  Like, I would get sick if I didn't eat at all.  Like, you, you, okay.  When you get, how long, how much do you sleep?  How long do you sleep?  I don't sleep very well because of my apnea and my frequent tingling, but I'd say I get  a good 35 minutes a night.  Well, most people, most people get about six to seven hours a night. 
[02:43:30]  Yeah, and I do that.  And they're not actually eating while they're asleep.  So I kind of liken this to, well, why don't we just stretch that out a little bit?  Now, now I, I get you and, and believe you me.  I mean, when I first came up with this idea, I was scared shit.  You know, what's going to happen by me not eating?  But you're actually, I'm actually eating.  You see, there's a difference here.  I'm not masticating as in chewing, but my body is still digesting lots of energy.  I mean, when I was putting my juices, I'd have like six, how many ounces? 
[02:44:00]  We call it milliliters in Australia.  What's it, 20 ounces?  That's about 12.  That's crazy, that milliliters thing.  12 ounces.  Okay, well, I was probably having about six, 20 ounces of, six times 20 ounces of juice.  16, 16 ounces.  Okay, so that's probably what I was having, six of those bottles a day.  Okay.  And I'm actually getting, as we were talking about earlier, so much nutrition that you  actually are not hungry.  So wait, you were juicing it up.  What were you putting in the blender?  I was putting in kale, which, you know, you've got K-A-L-E, kale.  I was putting in spinach.  I was using Brussels sprouts. 
[02:44:30]  Carrots?  Carrots, ginger, apple.  You weren't chewing any apple, though?  Nope.  No, no.  For 60 days, I didn't use my teeth once.  Wow.  I brushed them a lot.  Did your teeth hurt a lot when you started eating again?  Well, I don't know if you saw the movie, but I actually seriously had that first apple  and I bit my mouth.  Oh, that's right.  I forgot about chewing.  I actually bit my tongue.  I forgot how to chew.  I give it, you know, I was out of practice.  Do you still juice?  Oh, yeah, I love it.  I juice.  I try to, my day starts with a couple of juices every day because, see, I'm not an extreme 
[02:45:00]  guy anymore.  What I'm all about now is how can we work out a way to move the needle of consumption  of fruits and vegetables in your country and mine?  So, the average American consumes about 5% of all the calories they have in a year is  only fruits and vegetables.  Wow.  That 60% is processed food.  30% is animal product.  5% is whole grains and white potatoes, which is basically French fries.  And 5% is fruits and vegetables. 
[02:45:30]  So, I figured, what if we could move that dial from 5 to 10?  And what I've tried to do, because I was, like, down there at 5, and what I've tried  to do is sort of punch my number up to 10 or 15, which, you know, it still leaves room  for me to have the occasional pizza.  Still leaves room.  I love chocolate ice cream, and I still have that.  You know, I went to the movies last night, and I had a Haagen-Dazs ice cream, and I enjoyed  it.  But this morning when I woke up, instead of going down on the street, there was a bagel and  cream cheese guy out in the van.  Nice.  Good stuff.  And, you know, I paused, but I kept on walking, because today I've had my green juice, and 
[02:46:00]  I had an orange juice down in the lobby downstairs.  There was a guy selling fresh orange juice.  Do you work out?  I do, but I don't work out like crazy.  You know, one thing I'd love to improve in my life is to try to go to the gym more.  I make promises, like everybody, and, you know, I get there maybe 20%, 30% of the time  I make that promise.  So, you're pretty much a regular guy.  That's what I liked about this movie.  It was pretty obvious.  Oh, yeah.  Well, I think the thing that I'm trying to sort of, you know, there's lots of people.  In fact, I would say that most Americans get out of the shower in the morning, have a good 
[02:46:30]  hard look at themselves in the house of mirrors, and they're not happy with what they see.  Right.  And I don't reckon that's a good way to start the day.  I reckon you've got to start the day by actually saying, you know what, I'm going to  get better, I'm going to improve this.  And I have found when people have done my reboot, I call it a reboot, all right?  And you can go to jointhereboot.com, and we've got all the recipes and all the ideas  and the way to start there.  And if you go and do a reboot, and about 2,000 people have done it so far, I've only  shown the movie to 5,000, and about 40% of the people, when they see the movie, they 
[02:47:00]  say, hey, I'm going to start juicing.  And what they have found, and on our Facebook page, you can see it, all these people, after  five days, they just feel good about themselves, because they're giving themselves a pat on  the back because they've achieved something.  Now, what about waste product?  Because I think a lot of people would be concerned with...  I think a lot of people would be concerned with...  He makes scat films.  Okay, so...  I think a lot of people would be concerned if it's going to be a problem in that area. 
[02:47:30]  Lucy.  What's interesting is that the more...  If you were to just have fruit juice, which is high in sugar, or just carrot juice, which  is high in sugar, you're going to have a problem going to the bathroom if that's all you did  for two or three days.  When you take these cruciferous plant groups...  Now, cruciferous means anything that's green.  Okay?  The colour green.  When you put kale, when you put spinach, when you put Swiss chard or collard greens or any  of these things in, they're like a magnet.  What they do is they go into your bowels or into the 27 feet of tubing that's before... 
[02:48:00]  That's like sort of below your tit and just above your pelvis.  It's all crunched up in there.  And it's like a magnet.  And it grabs all of that junk and it just takes it out.  And you can be on the loo for like two or three days.  I mean, I've had people, when they sneeze, they've got to rush to the bathroom.  So it is like...  Wait, can I slow it down?  Does it take out some of the old feces?  Yeah, well, you see, now...  And is that true that we have... 
[02:48:30]  Dr. Steve said no.  He said no.  Yeah.  And by the way, look, I'm not a medical guy, but my family is very medical.  And I've spoken to lots of doctors about this.  Yeah.  If you speak to the doctors, they say it's not true.  If you speak to a lot of the naturopaths, they say it is.  Yeah.  So I reckon it's probably...  Well, their business depends on it.  So of course they're going to say yes.  Yeah, there's nooks and crannies in there.  I bet stuff gets caught.  A little bit here and there, maybe.  Yeah, I betcha.  Yeah, I'd say so.  But I also think that we're our best doctor.  So, you know, like, if you get some of these guys who are 400 pounds or some of these people 
[02:49:00]  that are that big, if you actually get an x-ray of their bowels and their lower intestine,  some of these poor people have 20 to 30 pounds of feces still in there.  And they're not in that perfect U-shape.  It's all over the place.  It looks like Chinese.  Did you ever take wheatgrass?  Yeah, I love wheatgrass.  That, I literally, I have to stiff-leg walk.  And right after you drink it?  That will make you shit.  Literally, you should be on the toilet with your legs sticking straight out.  When you're eating the wheatgrass.  Right through me. 
[02:49:30]  Well, it's like, the reason that is, is that's what's called an alkaline food.  So we have, there's two, foods can be divided into two groups, acidic or alkaline.  Basically, all the fruits and vegetables fit into the alkaline category.  And when that alkaline product hits your system, that's the magnet that just draws everything out.  So then your bowels are pretty clean.  And, like, for me, for 60 days on the road, I mean, I was doing number ones every, like, two hours.  I know a lot of trees have been planted and fed across this country. 
[02:50:00]  But as for number two, that would probably be every two to three days.  Okay, so it would lower the amount of times you have to actually.  You don't have to go every day.  But when you do this, you have a lot of time on your hands.  I mean, let's face it, you know, you're not eating, everything's organized.  That's true, yeah.  You've got a few problems with television.  I call it food porn.  You can't watch TV because everything on TV is a big cheese pizza coming out with it all dripping.  And, I mean, nightmares.  I have nightmares that I was eating.  What about things like health-wise, like cholesterol levels and triglycerides, things like that? 
[02:50:30]  Does it help out on that, that you're not eating?  You have no idea how much it helps out.  See, this is what I learned which really scared me, is that 70% of all disease to all of us is caused by our lifestyle choices.  Just think about that.  Seven out of ten, all of these diseases because of our lifestyle choices.  Now, that is what you eat, what you breathe in terms of smoking, what you drink, whether you have a lack of exercise.  So, these are big factors.  So, for me, I mean, I was like, okay, I've got to switch this around and change this for Joe. 
[02:51:00]  I've got to get out there and what can I do?  Because, obviously, this disease of mine is I'm causing it.  So, how can I prevent that?  So, I guess they're going out and just sort of saying, okay, Joe, stop eating that crap and start eating this stuff.  Let's see what happens.  And so, the medication, it took five months.  That was gone.  I haven't been on a pill since, haven't taken a tablet in three and a half years.  Wow.  I had knee surgery, so they had to put me under for that.  But that's the only time I've had any. 
[02:51:30]  And no hives, right?  No hives.  He cured his own hives that he was getting.  That's pretty goddamn amazing.  Yeah.  Another question about the movie, because I'm not going to be able to talk to you again.  The trucker, how's he doing today?  Well, Phil went from 429 pounds.  I don't want to ruin it for anyone, but he lost a couple of hundred pounds.  Jesus.  And he did that in nine months.  Yeah.  Then he went back to driving a truck.  See.  And when he was driving his truck, he worked out pretty quickly that he couldn't get. 
[02:52:00]  He started off good.  He would leave with a couple of big flasks of fresh juice.  So, on his way out for like two days, you know, juice can last about three days once you juice it,  if you keep it cold and you keep it sealed so the air doesn't get into it.  And he lasted three days with the juice on the way out.  And when he'd come back, he started getting into his old habits.  So, he went from about 225 and slowly crept up to 300 again.  All right?  From 429.  And he said, you know what? 
[02:52:30]  Life's too short for me doing this.  So, he quit his job.  He now works stack and shelves at Walmart and he's back down to 250.  Holy shit.  And he's on his way back down.  And Phil, same with him.  His medication doesn't take it anymore.  Believe it or not, he had the same illness that I had.  He was thinking anti-psychotics.  So, now he's just biting children.  So, he's good as gold.  And look, we've had thousands of people that have done this.  I mean, medication's a big issue.  I mean, you think about it.  You watch TV. 
[02:53:00]  You can't watch TV without them advertising some kind of pharmaceutical, right?  And then they add after it for the lawyers to sue the pharmaceutical company.  And they're the second biggest advertisers behind the card.  And winfulism.  So, for me, like if I come over here and I see that, you know, Americans are spending $248 billion a year on pharmaceuticals.  And listen, by the way, I've got nothing against those companies.  Because for eight years, they gave me drugs that kept me going, right?  What I'm all about is personal responsibility and saying, hey, can I get off these pills by eating the right food?  By making some different choices.  Yeah.  Hey, this guy's saying you're a scam. 
[02:53:30]  There's no such thing as colon plaque.  You didn't say there was colon plaque, right?  Colon plaque.  Yeah, like.  No, that's the guy's name.  I didn't say colon plaque, man.  Dr. Colon puts up on his wall that he went to medical school.  Yeah.  What Joe said is.  Colon plaque.  Wasn't he the Secretary of Defense?  Humpax got it wrong.  The doctors.  There's doctors saying there's nothing in your system.  There's this word called detox that people talk about a lot.  Now, I've chosen to use the word reboot.  Right.  Because detox is what your body's doing all the time. 
[02:54:00]  Your body is always detoxing.  You know, like the odors and the smells.  Except for Anthony, who's never detoxed in his life.  That's detoxing.  And so, like, in your bowels, I've spoken to some top colorectal surgeons.  Right.  And I've said, listen, is it possible you can have feces from, like, 12 years ago that are stuck in little crips and crevices?  Their answer is no.  But then I've spoken to some naturopaths and some people in the colonic world.  Right.  And they have said, yes, it is.  So I figure that in between there probably lies the truth. 
[02:54:30]  It's the truth.  The one thing I've learned, and this is really interesting, is that when you talk about what we know when it comes to health and food, is what we know, we know very little.  We don't know 99% of what's out there.  So I sort of come from this position of being humble, that I don't know everything, I hardly know anything, but I'm listening and ready to learn.  But your body is the best way to judge whether something is right or wrong.  And you know it works for you, and you know it works for some other people that have taken your advice. 
[02:55:00]  So, you know, who's to fucking say?  What made you choose, like, juicing and not, like, some other kind of, I don't know, I don't know what else you could choose.  You know what?  I tried everything else.  I went to witch doctors.  I did the mud bath.  I did the blood analysis.  I did everything.  I mean, you know, when you've got a disease where you shake someone's hand or have sex with them, and all of a sudden there's an imprint three hours later.  Jimmy gets that.  It's not great.  It's called Spirochete.  I was like the bubble boy or the elephant boy.  Can I answer your question?  Sure.  Because, in general, vegetables suck, and it's a lot easier to drink your vegetables. 
[02:55:30]  I like asparagus, though.  I eat, my nickname is the asparagus cube.  But you know how much, how many asparagus or spears, whatever, you would have to eat?  I do.  That's a pain in the ass.  So you took the easy way out, technically, by juicing.  Look, you know what?  I find it easier.  You're right.  I find it easier to juice than I do to eat the stuff.  You should see the pile of vegetables that go into one fucking drink.  You would never eat that on a regular basis.  But I like, I eat a lot of green vegetables.  I know it's just good for your blood and everything.  That's one thing I do right is eat a lot of green vegetables. 
[02:56:00]  A lot of pizzas.  Well, you talked earlier about blood pressure and cholesterol and these things.  See, the body, if given the chance, the natural state of the human body is to be healthy.  It's actually the smartest thing and the most genius thing you're ever going to have in  your life.  In fact, your body's far smarter than you'll ever be.  I mean, if you nick yourself or cut yourself, you don't need to have to sort of send magic  waves down there for that to heal, do you?  It'll heal itself.  Unless you're a hemophiliac.  But if you keep picking that scab and getting away, you're not going to heal.  A guy that always brings something negative to the conversation. 
[02:56:30]  You want to take a couple of phone calls?  Because they're lit.  Sure.  We got a lot of listeners that need a lot of help.  I'll talk to people.  Let's try to get one that's not drunk.  You need your head set on.  I'll tell you this, after watching Fat, Sick, and Nearly Dead, I juice once a day probably.  Fantastic.  Yeah.  And I feel way the fuck better.  It is good for you.  Way the fuck better.  Back when I was doing Tough Crab, there was a good juice place by my apartment.  I would always, every day I would have it.  No, I don't juice.  You know, maybe I should.  Yes, you do.  No, I, you know what I do?  It's an easy... 
[02:57:00]  I eat a lot of fruits and vegetables, not as much, but a lot of fruit.  I like that.  There's a lot of sugar in that.  And turkey, things like that.  But I should probably try it.  I want to give that a try because, you know, I work out and try to get in.  But there's always this right here.  Yeah.  You know.  Me too.  Well, that little bit right there, believe it or not, you know, that goes with the working  out.  That's hard to lose just on the juicing because it comes off many ways.  Well, that's what I mean.  But the thing is, with working out, too, it's very hard to get rid of the lower of the... 
[02:57:30]  Like, I have motherfucking abs underneath this fat.  Everyone does.  Well, we all do.  We all have muscles.  That's the gag.  Oh, okay.  All right.  Sorry.  Let's say...  Old literal Jim and Ope.  Let's say hi to James the Trucker.  James?  Hey, good morning, fellas.  How are y'all?  Hi.  We're talking to Joe Cross, who made this documentary.  He's fat-sick and nearly dead.  It's going to be out April 1st.  Yeah, Joe, I've got...  I mean, interested.  I listen to these guys every morning.  He sounds fat.  Holy moly. 
[02:58:00]  Yeah, you are to see me.  I am...  I'm pushing close to 400 pounds.  Yeah.  I'm six foot three.  Where's Iraq if he's pushing them?  Oh.  I'm big-boned.  I'm big-boned.  I wear a 15-H shoe.  Right.  And I'm a diabetic.  Wow.  I love fruit, but they tell me you can't have grapes, you know?  Yep.  You can't have this.  Much like a brontosaurus-like. 
[02:58:30]  Yeah.  And I was just wondering, is there...  I can't...  I can't chew stuff, and it give me the shits.  I can't stop, ever.  Jesus, you're a disaster.  This poor guy.  You're bumming everyone out.  You're big-boned, sweaty-asshole.  Yeah, this big-boned...  What do you suggest for a guy like this?  He apparently doesn't have enough time to really...  Shot-gun doctor.  Well, to start, is if you're diabetic type 1 or type 2?  Is there a menu of what all that you... 
[02:59:00]  No, he wants to know if you're diabetic type 1 or type 2.  Type 2.  So you take pills as opposed to taking a needle, right?  No, if they put me on the needle, then my trucking days are over.  Are you still working at Bill Cox's office?  So has your doctor told you that it's possible to reverse your diabetes, or has he said, you've  got this for life?  Well, he told me that I've had to lose weight, but I've tried everything.  I mean, you know, I'm...  Okay, so here's what I...  First of all, I'm not a doctor, okay?  And I appreciate you calling up. 
[02:59:30]  But what I would say to this is that when you're a diabetic, you've got to be very careful  of just drinking the juice.  It's not something that I recommend if it's high in fruit.  If it's high in the vegetables only department, then that's perfectly fine to drink.  But because you're diabetic, we've got to actually have you eating and drinking at the same time.  But you've got to go to what's called an all-plant diet.  So you should be able to eat only fruits, vegetables, nuts, beans, and seeds.  And if you did that together with the doctor supervising you, and you did that and you sort of made 
[03:00:00]  the commitment and you said, right, this is what I'm going to do.  And I'm going to do it for two weeks, and I'm going to see how I feel.  What you'll find is that your body will reboot itself, and you'll start to like the taste  of this food.  First four or five days, it's really tough.  But after that, you'll actually start to enjoy it.  And that's really how you trick the body into actually thinking that you start to like this  food.  If you have food that's high in salt, high in sugar, high in fat, when you have a piece  of lettuce, it doesn't taste good. 
[03:00:30]  But if you've had nothing for two weeks, and you're on a desert island, and I flew in with  some lettuce, you're going to go, how good's this?  So it's about taking the body back to this mindset of rebooting.  So don't juice a lot of fruits, I guess, for the sugar aspect.  Totally.  Not if you're diabetic.  But it's on our website, mate.  If you go to jointhereboot.com, there's a test you can take, which goes through all your  history, and we've got some nutritionists standing by there that can give you some information  and help you out here, all right?  What was the web?  What was the web, Ben?  So it's jointhereboot.com. 
[03:01:00]  Okay, got that.  All right.  All right, and good on you, mate.  And listen, hang in there, because, you know, you can go from 400 to 220.  Phil did it in nine months.  You can do the same.  I'm going to give it a shot, and I appreciate it.  And Phil looked like the type of guy that there's no way he was going to lose the weight.  Graham in Pennsylvania.  Graham.  Hey, how's it going?  Hey.  I'm a trucker.  Joe, I just want to ask you.  Everything what you're saying sounds good, and I wouldn't be opposed to start juicing, 
[03:01:30]  but how much more expensive is it to just drink juice?  Oh, of course.  Okay, so good question.  When we were out in the middle of the road, and Phil lived in Sheldon, Iowa, and we went  to the local Hy-Vee Market, which is a supermarket out there, and we calculated out that it costs  Hy-Vee Market?  What is that?  H-I-V-I.  Hy-Vee.  It's like a...  That's a terrible name for a market.  That's the market out there, actually.  What do you order there?  I'd like a fucking sarcoma burger.  And it ended up costing Phil around about 15 bucks a day to juice all the fruits and vegetables 
[03:02:00]  for the whole day.  Now, if you go to an organic farmer's market, it was costing around about $30, so about double.  So that's what it ended up costing.  Now, when you break that up over three meals, that's $5 for breakfast, $5 for lunch, and $5  for dinner.  Not that you juice that way, but if you break it down.  That would be bad.  And then also, let's talk about the cost of medication. 
[03:02:30]  Let's talk about how you do this, you're going to get less visits to the doctor, less days  off, less time buying bigger clothes, so you can actually save money in the long run.  Short-term investment for a long-term gain.  How's Phil's brother doing?  Bear.  Bear's a classic.  Now, Bear lost about 50 pounds.  I don't know what I can say about the movie, but Phil obviously was a big, fat guy, and  he decided to do what Joe was doing and juice and get his body in shape.  And Phil's brother, who was also a fat guy, was looking at Phil like he was a problem, 
[03:03:00]  but he wasn't, this guy Bear.  Can I say what happened?  Yeah, yeah, yeah, tell him, yeah.  And Bear has a fucking massive heart attack while they're filming the movie.  Oh, shit, wow.  His heart attack cost $58,000.  Yeah, his heart attack.  Wow, so juicing cost for a month like $500,000.  So that was, you know, doing that.  But he's basically looking at his brother like, yeah, that's for you, and you've got to really  take care of yourself.  We're all worried about you.  And I'm looking at Bear as he's saying this, going, look, you're an out-of-shape fat guy  too.  There's no price you could put on your health.  That's what I say.  Let me say.  The ant says. 
[03:03:30]  Let's say how to John and Dick.  What do you say that to?  Who listens?  Hey, John, how you doing, mate?  Let me say that.  Hey, John.  Hey, boys, love you, love the show.  Hey, listen, I'm a big fat guy myself.  What happens to your skin?  Of course you are.  You're listening to the show.  What happens to your skin after you lose 80 or 90 pounds?  If you're like 270, like me, and I lost like 80, 90 pounds, what happens to your skin?  It depends on how it's lost, John.  And some people, like for example, for Phil, if he stays around this way, he's been down 
[03:04:00]  about two years now.  And over time, some people need to go and get some surgery done to get rid of the excess  skin.  Everyone's different.  It depends.  My skin was perfectly fine.  It actually came back in with no problem.  But there's a little bit of genetics in terms of how your skin responds after that.  But one of the things that I have found is that when you lose weight quickly and it comes  off, when you do this, it pours off you very quickly.  If you go back to your old ways, it'll come straight back on. 
[03:04:30]  And kind of what your body will then do, it starts to store more fat because it thinks,  holy crap, we've got a famine on and another famine could come.  So it starts to store it up more.  So what's really important when you do something like this is that you then go to a plant-based  diet for a period of time.  Remember, I did two months of juicing, three months of eating the plant food, which enabled  my muscle, my cells, the memory to say, hey, this is where Joe should be.  So then the skin was able to sort of adjust and for me, it worked fine. 
[03:05:00]  Now, some people do need surgery when they've been hugely overweight and particularly if it's  all around the abdomen.  But when the weight is distributed evenly over the body, you sort of tend to have a better  chance of not having to have surgery.  Oh, wow.  This guy's 500 pounds from Brooklyn, William.  Oh, boy.  It's Joe Cross.  Hey, William.  Little Bill.  Ramone, get this funny prick of diabetic enema.  Ramone.  I don't think this guy's being serious. 
[03:05:30]  Ramone, you're a faggot.  Right.  What'd you say?  Ramone, plants are assholes.  What do you, why would you, why would you, why would you call, who, first of all, how  did he get past the screener?  Right.  England is a piece of crap.  He's from Australia.  Why is she a great deal?  I'm from Australia.  What an asshole.  What a dope.  We don't like England either.  He called him a limey.  Ah, ah, England. 
[03:06:00]  You're up by 7,000 miles.  200 years ago, they shipped us off as convicts.  We've never been happier.  Yeah.  Did you crap yourself once while you were on the 60 Days?  No, I didn't.  But I've had lots of friends that have.  Well, you thought it was a fart and, you know, we've all been there.  Follow through.  No, I didn't.  Yeah.  Yeah, nothing.  I've had that happen while making love.  There's no joy in that.  And what do you, what do you do?  What do you do now?  Like, you're still obviously living in Australia.  Well, I'm actually on tour in America.  I'm going to go around with the film.  I'm going to spend the next seven months traveling across your country.  I'm going to go to towns and on our Facebook page and our fat, sick and nearly 
[03:06:30]  dead.com page, we have, like, the tour of where we're going.  And we're going to try and get to more towns.  And so I want to try and get out down to the south.  I want to get down to Mississippi.  I want to get down to Alabama.  Oh, you'll see some people down there that need some juice.  Yeah.  Well, look, you know, one of the things I found which was quite interesting as I  drove across the country is I spoke to over 500 people.  And I asked them, I said, you know, whose fault is it that you're this size?  And, you know, not a single person blamed anyone else except themselves.  So I think Americans, they're very much in this position where they're prepared to 
[03:07:00]  take responsibility and they're looking for a way out.  And realistically, I mean, it's pretty crazy that I've got to get on radio and make a  movie in 2011 about eating fruits and vegetables.  We've been doing this for five million years.  That's what we ate mostly.  I eat a lot of blueberries.  I'll actually buy them.  I like to run water by the sink.  I just go handful after handful.  I hate blueberries.  I love blueberries.  No, but not if they're fresh.  They're very delicious.  They're very good at antioxidants.  Well, I've got a theory that we see in color. 
[03:07:30]  You know how animals don't see in color?  They see black and white.  Oh, yeah.  You know that?  Oh, yeah.  They see black and white.  So do I.  Dogs notoriously do.  Why do you reckon we see in color?  Fruits and vegetables.  So we know who to keep our daughters away from.  And if you think about it, if you look at all fruits and vegetables, they're all grown  on plants that you can reach.  Right?  Well, that's true.  Well, they've sort of come with us.  And what we do is we defecate the seeds out.  And we help them spread their love and their growth around the planet.  And they help us by keeping us healthy. 
[03:08:00]  So we've sort of gone hand in hand with plants.  And without plants, we're in big trouble.  Oh, no.  I would never doubt that, sir.  That's for sure.  I like photosynthesis.  Do you remember that at school?  I do.  Photosynthesis is very good.  It's very cool.  Fuel from the sun.  We need it to breathe.  Without it, we wouldn't breathe.  Well, plants give up carbon dioxide.  How many times have I said that angrily on a date?  Oxygen.  Photosynthesis.  She just looks at you like, what? 
[03:08:30]  Are you going to plan on picking up a camera again?  Has this gotten you into filmmaking?  Look, I mean, it's the hardest thing I've ever done.  I've done a lot of things in my life.  The hardest thing, forget doing the juice for 60 days, making the movie.  I mean, it's boring as batshit not eating.  Yeah.  How do you come up with this idea of how do you make a movie about not eating fun, right?  So it was a big challenge.  It was pretty tough.  Did you get yourself an editor and a crew, or did you do it yourself?  I came over, and I never knew anything about it, so I hired some guys.  They weren't too good, so I got rid of them.  I hired some other guys.  Oh, great. 
[03:09:00]  Yeah, that wasn't true.  You would assume they would know what you don't.  I hired some other guys, and then they were great.  Yeah.  And we ended up with the hardest part about making a movie is actually not the shooting.  It's actually when you come back into the edit studio, you've got 500 hours of footage.  And now what?  And you go, okay, let's start.  Let's make it interesting and make it linear.  And I don't know whether you guys listen to yourself back on the radio, but I hate watching  myself.  And you have to do that 8,000 times.  You've got to see it, man.  And then by the time you're done with the product, this happens with music too, and any 
[03:09:30]  kind of recording you do, you get so desensitized to what you're seeing, you think, at one point  you do, I think everyone reaches a point going, this is total shit.  Yeah, it can't be good.  I've watched it like a thousand times, you think this isn't interesting, it's not funny,  it's shit.  But then you've got to kind of take yourself out of it.  Oh, and we had the economic crisis happening right in the whole middle of all this.  So here am I, a finance guy, who's in an edit suite in the middle of New York City going,  what am I doing, and I came out to my world, which I'm supposed to know about, and I'm  going, what am I doing? 
[03:10:00]  Yeah.  So I had the double whammy of like, I don't know what the fuck I'm doing.  You're still keeping tabs on the finance world, the world of finance?  Oh, look, I do my best.  I mean, I think it's, you know, I'm a little bit disappointed in what's going on, to be  honest.  In what way?  Because...  Oh, look, you know, I think that we've had this situation where we've had rape and pillage  of all of the government sector by the private sector, and we've had like all these hands 
[03:10:30]  in the till by all these guys, and it's just unfortunate and sad to see that we've got  like governments bent over on their knees, like with all this debt, but corporate balance  sheets looking strong as ever.  Don't you see, though, that maybe the corporate guys were running their business a little better  than the government was running theirs?  I see a lot of waste in government.  I see a lot of the corporate guys went actually into the government to run the government and  then do some deals with their mates in the corporate world.  Because I see it the other way around, too, though.  I see a lot of government people getting their hands in the private sector when they should 
[03:11:00]  probably just be left alone to their own devices.  I know the bailout was a big thing.  Yeah.  That was a big thing that I'm not sure I agree with totally, but apparently General Motors  seems to be as...  They pulled themselves out of bankruptcy.  Do they pay back their fucking stockholders from before, or are they done what they don't  owe them?  Sorry, bankruptcy.  Sorry, new stock.  New stocks are out.  Yeah.  But I don't know.  You could look at this from both sides, but I kind of see it more like the government  is really intervening in business and our private life a little too much. 
[03:11:30]  I kind of like when they're a little more at arm's distance.  I do think some of these corporations do need to be held accountable for their shitty practices  that they're doing.  I mean, when you get an investment company betting against the loans that they're putting  out by shorting it, it amazes me that they actually aren't going to prison for that.  But I do think the government has gotten themselves a little too involved in the private sector.  I actually agree with you. 
[03:12:00]  I don't think the two are separate, though.  I agree with you 100%, but I just feel that there's times that I have seen that you don't  necessarily need to have the private sector involved in government business, and you don't  need the government business involved in private sector.  True.  But there is a kind of a gray area in the middle where the two have to kind of work together.  Those scumbags short in that stock, I don't even know much about it.  Oh, no, I know.  Those motherfuckers, they are vultures that literally, it should be legal to shoot them 
[03:12:30]  in the temple.  They were giving out shitty loans, and then they were betting against those loans by shorting  the actual stock.  The people should be allowed to get a hold of you.  It's astounding.  In India, some guy was dragged out, some CEO, he was like one of those, and he was beating  the death in the street.  That's the only way to handle people like that.  Wow.  If you allowed people to beat them to death, they would never fuck with people's money  again.  That's a little, wow.  No, I think some people should be beaten to death.  Beaten to death.  But it would, boy, that would cause some rift on Wall Street out there. 
[03:13:00]  Yeah, they wouldn't do it anymore.  I guess I'm on the side of the little guy, because the little guy, the small business  guy, he's a guy who has to go out there every day and make ends meet, and he's battling  out there, and he's trying to hire people, he's trying to make a business.  And I just think that some of these really big guys that get the special treatment, I just  don't, it just seems, somehow it doesn't seem fair to me.  That's all.  I agree with you on that.  Like, I don't like the idea that Obama wanted to go in and everybody making over $250,000  is considered rich and raise their taxes, because a lot of those people, small business fits 
[03:13:30]  into that.  And you're not going to just go, well, I'll pay extra taxes.  You're going to cut back on who you hired to do things, and it's going to put people  out of work.  But then you get a deal like, you see, with General Electric, they made a shitload of money  and paid no taxes last year.  GE?  Yeah.  And they're saying, you know, they're saying, hey, these are the tax laws that are in place,  they utilize them to the best of their ability, and I guess they wound up paying zero taxes  on billions of dollars of profit.  They've got some great financial lawyers working for them. 
[03:14:00]  I think when you come from another country and you come to America, one of the things  you notice here is just your backbone, the backbone of your people, they are an amazing  race.  I mean, you have the friendliest people in the world here, and trust me, I drove across  your country, and I have a very different view of America after doing this.  87%, sure.  They're very friendly, and they're very loving, they're open, and they're caring people.  Now, these guys, they believe in the American dream, and what I don't want to see happen 
[03:14:30]  is that American dream being shattered, and that is, you know, have your own house, get  your kids to college, and have enough money to retire.  But the whole thing is, when you achieve that, you don't want to be then chastised for it.  No, you don't.  Absolutely not.  Because a lot of times now the government steps in and says, just because you're successful,  they want, it seems like they want everyone in debt.  Like, if you happen to be lucky enough to own your own house, even have a mortgage, it's  a little property, you've got your family and this, and you're not buried in debt, they  will look at you like the type of person that then needs to bring the rest of the country 
[03:15:00]  up through what you did and your hard work to try to achieve this American dream.  And to me, it's vilifying people that are doing exactly what this country was supposed  to be, giving you the opportunity, not a promise, the opportunity to do.  I agree 100%.  I love Australia, by the way, and I want to go there so bad.  I've never been there.  But everybody that's come back from there has said it's amazingly, fantastically great.  And the people are friendly as fuck, and it's just great.  I want to go there.  Is it easy for Americans to get laid there? 
[03:15:30]  Very.  Because of the accent?  Very.  Oh, jeez.  No.  Australian accents.  Guys get fucking so much action over here.  They're used to it, though.  No, I mean, up here, guys get a lot of action.  I want to bring my boogie board there and go to Indonesia.  Please, do it on the reef.  We're a very friendly nation as well.  No, you'd go well down there.  Yeah.  We're England's fucking bastard children, so we have something in common.  We have.  No, we'd love to have you guys down in Australia.  You'd love it.  Oh, I would.  I would.  I'd love to have you down there.  Come down when it's your winter, too, because it's nice and warm.  Yeah.  We should fucking do a show from there.  That would be great. 
[03:16:00]  You should.  We can't even organize a fucking show from the Hard Rock.  Oprah.  Oprah was just down there.  Because it's the Hard Rocks down there.  Yeah, because it's the Hard Rocks down there.  They put it all off her.  Let's fly all the way there for one show.  One show will come back.  Oprah was.  They even put an O on the Harbour Bridge for her.  I saw that.  Yeah.  I saw that last night.  They might do an O and an A for you guys.  I like the O and A.  That would be...  I saw Hugh Jackman smash his face into some whites.  Oh, yeah, you know.  And J for juice.  Or Jimmy.  Yeah, for juice is fine.  For juice.  We'll say it's for juice.  Hey, speaking of Australian, you mentioned the Oprah. 
[03:16:30]  What's that place called?  Una?  Uluru.  With the Red Rocks.  Uluru.  Uluru.  Yeah, we...  Ayers Rock, or the Aboriginal word is Uluru.  You didn't hear about this place, eh?  It's all red rocks and stuff.  Yeah, beautiful.  But I guess it's...  Is it spiritual?  Very spiritual for the Aborigines.  And when you go there...  I haven't been, but all my friends that have been say they're quite touched, and watching  sunsets out there is one of the most beautiful things you can do in the world.  They say it could be the most amazing place on Earth.  Yeah, it's a phenomenal...  It's a...  The astronauts quite often comment about how they can see Uluru from space. 
[03:17:00]  Wow.  How beautiful it is.  That's amazing.  Pop up a picture of Uluru, please.  I was there once.  No, you weren't.  No, you weren't, Chip.  It was.  How do you spell Uluru?  How do you spell Uluru?  U-L-U-R-U, I think.  Wow, that's cool.  Look at that mesa.  But it's like a...  You see it?  It's a red mesa.  And the rock changes colors as the sun moves.  Wow, that's very cool.  Donald Trump would love to put a hotel right there.  Just mow it over. 
[03:17:30]  Just bulldoze it down and put an elevator up in there.  Yeah, I know.  Why is it right?  Put a juice bar on top.  Juice bar.  He just sees hotels.  Are people allowed to climb on that, or is it one of those...  You know, they used to be able to climb on it, but the aboriginals ask you not to.  Why?  There's plenty.  We've switched the climbing of Uluru to the climbing of Sydney Harbour Bridge now.  Oh, really?  That's our number one tourist attraction, is climbing the bridge.  It's called Bridge Climb.  Really?  Yeah.  My little nephew was in Australia recently.  He says it's just a nice, phenomenal experience.  You're allowed to climb the bridge?  Yeah, yeah.  You've got to have a breathalyzer before you go on, so you might travel. 
[03:18:00]  Oh, I'm out.  Oh, really?  Yeah, I get knocked out.  I used to anyway.  Wait, how high up is it?  How high up is it at the time?  It's really high.  I mean, it's like...  They say it's amazing to do.  Yeah, it's a red rock.  You hike up and over the damn thing.  How do you climb the bridge?  I'm going to have a guess.  You can probably look up a thing.  I'm going to have a guess that it's like...  I'm going to have a guess that it's 400 feet.  Can you see the bridge?  You're not really hiking it.  I mean, you're not really climbing it.  You're kind of just hiking it.  Walking it?  Yeah, they made it so it's easy to walk.  You've got to be in shape.  By bridge?  You've got to be in shape.  And you've got to wear a special overalls. 
[03:18:30]  You can't be afraid of heights either, I would guess, right?  You're tethered, right?  No, you're tethered.  Yeah, this thing, Jimmy.  Okay, yeah, look at that.  You're on the big arch of the top of the...  Wow, look at that.  Why haven't you done that, Joe?  Over the Sydney Opera House and everything you can see over there.  I'd be scared of heights, to be honest.  Wait, I am too, but...  I'm scared too, but I would do that.  Wait, are you tethered to it?  Yeah.  No, you're just walking.  You've got a harness on.  Do you know how scared I would be doing that?  You're like Tony Manero and his friends on the Verrazano.  I'd be so fucking scared doing that.  It's a great story.  The entrepreneur who came up with that, he said, 
[03:19:00]  listen, I've got this idea.  Why don't we allow people to climb the bridge?  It took him over five or six years to get anyone interested in the idea.  First of all, how do you insure something like that?  Yeah, well...  That seems to me like, yeah, I want regular Joes to climb a bridge.  Australians are pretty relaxed about insurance, man.  We don't get caught up in this stuff.  That's good.  See, that's fantastic.  Hold on.  We're fine here.  Your fault.  Very good.  We're fucked in the United States because we've got some amazing bridges right here in New York.  That would be a great thing to do.  Yeah, amazing thing to do.  It will never happen in New York City.  No, no.  They can never do anything like that.  Oh, that's cool.  It gives you those places that you can't do everything here. 
[03:19:30]  You've got to go to special places.  I would be so fucking scared to do that.  You'd be the person if I was behind you.  Did you not see Gail?  She was up there with Oprah and she was like...  Did Oprah climb it?  Yeah, but she had a panic attack or not like an attack.  Well, she was scared that Oprah was going to collapse the whole thing.  She's not quite that big.  Oprah climbed it?  Oprah and Gail, they were all up there.  Too bad there wasn't some juice at the top for Oprah.  She went a different way.  Oh, the other juice. 
[03:20:00]  Oh, I see what you mean.  You know what?  Why don't we wrap up and get the hell out of here?  All right, Joe.  Because it's coming up.  Joe, I really did enjoy this movie.  Absolutely.  Oh, I enjoyed the interview.  I've got to see the movie.  Yeah, Roland was a big fan.  Believe it or not, Roland is juicing because of your movies.  He's lost a few.  Yeah, he looks good, Roland.  His brother has lost a few.  He's juicing Twizzlers and Snickers bars.  I believe Troy is a closet juicer already here in the...  Well, he's a closet a lot of things.  Oh, boy.  A lot of things.  Troy?  Yeah, he's got a lot of closet things. 
[03:20:30]  He's got a lot of closets.  He rubs the pulp in his hair when he's done wonderful.  I don't even know what that means because I don't feel like I'm going to HR now.  I'm just making a joke.  I don't even know what the fuck Troy's up to.  But he's juicing, yeah.  He's juicing.  Joe Cross, it was a pleasure.  Fat, sick, and nearly dead in theaters across the country April 1st.  Will be available on DVD next month.  And one last endorsement.  You got me with the end of the film there, Joe.  Hey.  You got me with the...  Oh.  With the...  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, yeah.  It's a good ending, isn't it? 
[03:21:00]  Yeah, you got a good ending for your film and you got...  Don't ruin it.  You got me with some teary eyeballs.  I'm embarrassed to say that, but you got me, Joe.  I appreciate it.  Yeah, we...  You got me, Joe.  It's a pretty...  The theater, they do cry.  They do?  On that scene?  It's an inspirational, motivational, uplifting film.  So we feel that there's room for that in the world right now.  You did all right, man.  Come back and see us.  I will.  I loved it.  It was great.  Come back this way.  Screw that.  I want to go down under.  Well, come down to Australia next summer.  You got money?  Can you fly us in for free? 
[03:21:30]  Do what?  I'll talk to some mates of mine.  Yeah, there you go.  I got friends in high places.  Let's work this out.  Yeah.  Let's get on a flight.  Very cool.  Thank you, man.  All right.  Thanks, guys.  I appreciate it.  Thank you very much.  And I think we're done.  Yes.  Yes.  You got some, Jimmy?
